-Good morning. -Good morning gentlemen.
This is Tony.

Lets get down to business.
Mission name is lANOS.
Your aim is the complete distruction of a ship.

and will part at the end.
He'll arrange so you will never be found.
You shouldn't be seen,hangin' around together.
He's your gardian angel.
Here's how the thing goes...
You must know that in Angola
the civil war has started again.

Goodnight.
I’ll make it real nice. Give it to me.
-Give it to me! -No!
-Give it to me! -No!
Then just gimmie a kiss.
Just like that.
Lipofski lives in Geneva since the fall of the Wall.
That's when he started doing business in Africa.
He gets the guns from the former eastern block...
and sends them over to Angola by ship.
We want to stop that arms dealing.
We allready have our man in Geneva.
He'lli nform us about the next cargo.
-Add some red colour. -I have.
You wanna do it together?
You go on by yourself now.
What are you doing?
Here you are!
-I wanna talk to you. -I’m listening.
This time l don't want any money.
l have a friend who's in jail.
You don't want any money
but you're asking for more.
-What has your friend done?
We don't want any french blood on his hands.
lf they want that ship to go down...
lets just put a nice bomb inside.
Sure thing.
l agree, but we don't get to choose what to use.
-It’s your turn. -Get your hands out.
-Wait. -Wait for what?
-In my heaIth! -In your first mission.

The target will be in Casablanca
at the 18th,this month.
-In ten days from now. -We don't have much time.
You'll prepare on position.

We'll cover your expences. Don't over do it though.

Excuse me, miss?
I’m not in the mood for company.
What happened to you?
Nice trick there with the lights.
-Worried about me? -Leave me alone.
-We don't see you that often. -Good morning.
It’s shame staying inside all
the time. Is it better like that?
-What have you told him? -I just asked if he's gay.
-I think we're surrounded. -You're too smart.
I’m off for a swim.
Are you on vacations? Do
you prefer English or French?
It’s not a safe place for such a pretty woman.
Is your husband like yourself?
Hello sir. How are you today? You
have a very beautiful wife.
-And who am l talking to? -Ok, listen
to me, I’ll get straight to the point.
I’m working at the American embassy of Geneva.
We know who you are and
we know what you're after.
-What do you want? -Does
Anita Hans ring any bells?
She should be here tomorrow afternoon
probably between the hours of 5 and 6.
Do not touch that boat. Under any
circumstances. Do you hear?
It’s too dangerous. Remember what l told you.
It’s a NATO operation here.
It was a real pleasure meeting you.
Have a nice day and enjoy Casablanca.
Thank you.
Are you ok, my love?
The tongue thing wasn't necessary.
Nice dress. It suits you.
l should've wore a tie.
I’ve never seen you with a tie.
Are you kidding me? I’ve even got a tuxedo.
And two bow ties!
What's your answer in that?
We are not changing anything.
We go on like nothing happened?
-Exactly. -Doesn't that bother you?
This whole story bothered me from the beginning.
That's a new one.
Tony, my fiend.
What do you want? I’ll do anything for you.
l know Gianni.
My last discovery. Just look and come.
lf you want her, she's all yours tonight.
For the present time all l want
is 150 grams of gunpowder.
The purest you've got. l insist on that.
-Who do you think you're
talking to? -I’m a man of trust.
Perfect.
lf you got something to say, say
it. We're on the same side here.
Don't you worry. I’m doing what I have to do.
But this is my last mission.
-I don't understand. -I’m thinking
about it for a long time now.
-I can see that. -I’m serious.
So, you're actually quitting us?
You know that once you quit,
you can never come back?
I’ve thought about that too.
Well, thing again. Cover your back.
l can't wait any longer. That's my last one.
They'll hunt you down.
Let'em do as they wish. I kept my side of the deal.
What deal? We have no deal.
Slow down.
I’m bored.
I’m bored of lying to my friends,
which l almost have none, anymore.
You got any friends outside this damn job?
I wanna have kids. Before I’m 40.
You want a man and kids?
OK. Just wait 6 more months.
I must do all these now. l feel it inside.
You feel what?
Anyway.
But if you go, your life would be so miserable.
You'll see.
Did l wake you?
-Why aren't you sleeping? -Because l can't.
I’ve got what you need.
You take this and you fall asleep in no time.
I’ll wake you up in the afternoon.
You're reading the same
page for the last 15 minutes.
We'll be waiting for 4 hours.
Then we move to plan B.
Return to Paris tomorrow, with the 10:30 flight.
Ramond will receive a telegram that his father died.
You'll get your tickets from the airport.
Gimmie the pins.
Have you told anyone else that you're quitting?
At the office only.
-Is everything ok? -Yes.
I’ve got a swiss passport. Should l wait for you?
I’ll find you at the bar.
-Come with us. -Why?
Nothing serious.
Shit down.
Open your suitcase. It’s yours, right?
Get out!
How do you explain this?
Good morning.
Thank you.
Yes. George.
Good morning. I’m in a bit of
a hurry to catch my flight.
Congratulations, operation successful.
''Anita Hans'' sunk 120 miles outside Maroco.
They've gotten Carla, in Geneva.
We found that the usual way.
It’s been taken care of by our legal department.
-Why they arrested her? -She was
carrying 150 grams of heroin.
They probably used her as a bate.
-Except she's... -She's...what?
I’m not gonna think the worst scenario.
While they were bothering with her
arrest, someone passed 3 kilos of that.
Where is colonel Grace?
On a mission.
Take some days off.
You worth it.
Just let us know where you are all the time.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Congratulations for the mission. one more time.
It was really successful.
Are you OK?
Need anything?
Can i stay for some days in your apartment?
You have any kinda problems?
I’ll get you out of here.
It’s clear you've been a victim of a really bad joke.
150 grams of heroin sound
like a really bad joke to you?
You have no criminal record.
You've been vacating in
Maroco with your husband.
You've never had any troubles.
You're not taking drugs, it's gonna
come up at the blood tests.
Not even the worst lawyer, would loose your case.
How long will this take?
Not that much. I’m already working on your papers.
I’ve found out how similar cases were handled.
-So? -Seven releases so far.
Don't you worry. We're right beside you.
-It’s me, I must see you. -I’m here all the time.
How's Loik? I cannot find him anywhere.
He's probably on vacations.
I’m coming by.
Go. We'll take care of it.
That's good news.
I talked to some people facing
the same charges as you.
-You won't be staying here much.
-And what does that mean?
Your employer wants you to do
something, while you're here.
I’m just carrying out the message to you.
Her name is Helena Standler. Works for Lipofski.
She was to be released next week.
You must kill her.
Did the office plant the drugs into my suitcase?
I’m just carrying out the message.
Tell them, they can go to hell.
The police might go over to your  .
They can find 10 kilos of heroin
there. l won't be able to help then.
You'll go to jail for 20 years at
least. think of your parents.
Don't bring my parents into
this shit, you fucking asshole.
OK.
Excuse me.
-I wanna get some sleep. -I know.
Why they didn't just say it, from the beginning?
Helena Standler works in the jail hospital.
She's got a good reputation, but
you better be very careful with her.
Everything is gonna be all right, you'll see.
So?
There was an American agent inside ''Anita Hans''.
That's why they killed Ramond.
We totally ignored them in Maroco.
We drawn one of their own, so
they had to kill one of our own.
We bothered them and not it came back to us.
Will they stop here?
They're out of the game.
They worry about other shit.
I’m worried about George.
First it was Ramond, now Lisa.
l don't know what you're planning on
doing,but l just don't want him around.
I’ll find a new mission for him,somewhere far away.
Ramond was drown at Aspreto. Allright?
Very well. We're done.
Hi.
l can't find the colonel.
They're sending me to train
the commandos in Sourinam.
Trainer...They can count on me.
Loik, I need a favor.
Just don't bother me with the office.
In everything else, l totally trust you.
George,what brings you here?
I’ll ask directly. Did you fraimed Lisa?
Double-corbonatted soda.Helps breathing skin.
Cleans the toxines. wanna give it try?
For Lisa, it was just orders to be followed.
-Why? -They had to get her.
-I don't care about the rest. -You don't?
You know why we sunk that boat?
Your whole life you've been tricking
people.Now it was your turn.
lf you wanted to have rules, being
a secret agent was a mistake.
Ramond is dead.
I did't know that.
We had to expect that from the Americans.
It was a woman that killed him.
About I .65 tall, blond with short hair.
You know Maria Menendez? You should.
She's Spanish, independent.
She has contacts with the Americans.
We've spotted her at Maroco
with the guy at the embassy.
She works for whomever
pays the most.Interested?
She lives in Madrid.
I’ll give her a place to live,if you
want her.With great pleasure.
You ain't knocking,you may
as well close the damn door.
-You wanted to see me? -Not me.
Go to the first floor.
They are waiting for your report and your passport.
-You haven't delivered yet. -I don't have it on me.
Your mission was over in our last meeting.
You know what happens when
someone oversees our rules.
What is that?A threat?
A warning.
I’m working here a long time,
so l know what's going on.
l don't even know who you are.
So don't go threatening me.
They want me to take care some woman in jail.
She's being released in 4 days.
Helena Standler.You know her?
No.
She's highly ranked in lipofski's organization.
Why we won't wait for her to be
released? It would be simpler.
l don't get that either,but l don't have any choice.
-You shouldn't be here. -Stop.
-When are you gonna see a lawyer?
-Do not get in trouble because of me.
Hold on.
Good evening. Espresso, please
Thanks.
Give me a cigarette.
Cleansing and bandaging.
The pictures are from a motion sensitive camera.
Switzerland is full of those.
That's him.
Police gathered three burned bodies.
You supposed to send him somewhere
far away. What is he doing in Switzerland?
He's alive.
Seems so, but I’m not sure if
we must be happy about it.
What's his game? Is he interested in Lisa?
He's feeling betrayed. You're underestimating him.
Is he or is he not a professional?
Disobedience means betrayal. You know that.
l have to pay the price. We all have to.
It’s me. May l come in?
Thank you.
-May l use the printer? -Over there.
Can you bring the package I’ve left you?
I’m off to bed.
-Does it hurt? -No.
Thank you.
Perfect.
Dizitalin. Powerfull, hearttonic...
bad also deadly for the healthy.
Standler has the heart of a teenage girl.
Me too. l can have some too.
-They've thought about that for sure. -And?
They're taking that risk.
They trust you. Why you are so afraid?
It’s me, Loik. l hope you didn't do anything stupid.
I’m glad you're here. l wanted to talk to you.
Three days ago none wanted to talk to me.
What's happening?
You didn't inform neither Loik of myself.
Ain't that a bit unusual?
Swiss newspapers have intersting subjects.
He know Lipofski and all of a
sudden he wants to give him away.
He became a burdon. To whom?
What do u expect? Geopolitical lesson?
Law is the secret.
You can't be sensitive about it. It’s just a job.
We wanted Lipofski in Africa, but he got stubborn.
We had to proove to him that we're not joking.
We can't allow to Standler or
noone else to ruin everything.
Jail was your idea?
l love Lisa too much. She's
not gonna have any problems.
And if she's not cooperative?
We asked her to obey, not to cooperate.
Lately you seem that you can't see
the difference between those two.
What's your problem? Ethical? idealistic?
You had no second thoughts
in killing that girl in Madrid.
For the time being I’ve blocked the investigation.
l wonder myself if there is any point in all these.
We all came to wonder that sometime.
But there is one thing I’m certain of.
l wouldn't change this for the world.
I’m talkin as a friend. there
is a mission waiting for you.
It’s not a fake one. You have my word.
Congratulations. You did an excellent job.
Come with me. I’ll tell you something important.
You'll always be alone.That's the
way it has to be,for an agent.
It’s not a matter of courage only.
It’s a matter of self-preservation.
Jump.
-It’s too high. -Jump Lisa.
You can do it. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
Jump.
Why there's nothing left of my country?
You should've stayed there.
What's wrong with her?
Her son died some days ago. She just found out.
-I’ll talk to her. -No.
Come on,Helena.
-You want a glass of water? -Yes,please.
-Here you are. -Thanks.
We can't stay here all night.
Bank of Kuweit, Luxemburg.
You French people are so expensive.
Less expensive then you American people.
We don't mess in your business.
Money is the essence of war.
l would be helping sick children.
Mother Teresa, dressed up in Armani.
What's you gonna do with your
agent and my troublemaker?
You're gonna keep them?
We are ready.
DaSilve is tougher then me while working.
Like a Libanese man.And now he has
taken charge of the whole country.
We're not businessmen. We're deplomats.
Ain't that the same thing?
Lipofski.They're here.
-Do you speak Portuguese? -A few.
Nice.Talk to him in English.He prefers that.
Come with me.
About that...
Noone will be waiting for her
once she goes out of jail.
May l introduce you my French friends.
Sir James.
They sent me to take you back to France.
Give it to me.
-How do you feel? -Empty.Totally empty.
Blue BMW,plate number
283BG43. He's probably alone.
-Are you allright? -I’m cold.
-Do you want me to open the heater? -Yes,please.
