Give him to us
out of the question
I baptise you balthazar...
...in the name of the father,
son and holy ghost
amen
receive the salt of wisdom
jacques
marie
see you next year
years pass
that one
property for sale
marie, come and look
look at that
five hundred acres ready for sowing
and I, a school teacher,
swotted it up from books
but the land isn't ours
never mind, we'll be all right
super donkey
fast
modern
she may be in love with him,
and he with her
and he with her?
That's right
you don't say
a donkey?
In mythology
solicitor
i'll never return now that
my daughter is dead
I haven't sold the farms, so why
don't you run them yourself?
You once told me you'd like to try
you'd have to give up teaching
to do it
read on
enclosed is my formal authorisation
to work the farms
my solicitor will advance you
the money to start with
I give you an entirely free hand
you don't have to render accounts
to me
and now i'm told I must render
accounts to you
that's right
i'm not obliged to.
What if I refuse?
I wouldn't advise that. There's
enough gossip already
gossip?
Take the donkey home. I'll walk
anonymous letters
they began to arrive after
the sale of the wood
they alleged that your father
- without proof
how vile
the price of your father's success:
Envy and jealousy
my father has nothing to be
ashamed of
i've come to sort it out
does your father believe these letters?
My father has never asked for thanks.
Now he's hurt
yes, it's balthazar
marie, nothing's changed
except you, marie
prettier and more beautiful
than ever
remember what I once told you here?
You'd be my only love
but i'm not sure I love you, jacques
is it so hard to know?
If I don't love you, I don't want
to mislead you
aren't you happy with me?
Very happy
speak to him alone. I'll wait
don't let this business
come between us
won't we meet again?
If you weren't so proud
the matter would be settled
why should I make a gesture?
The boy was on your side
and you threw him out
give them the accounts
they're my business. I'm not obliged
to give accounts
anyway, I can't find them
that's just the attitude which
helps your enemies
the courts will decide who's right
why keep the donkey if marie hides
and doesn't feed him?
That old-fashioned donkey
makes us look ridiculous
we must avoid ridicule at all costs
balthazar...
they say he does many odd jobs for him...
...like cutting firewood
he's very obliging
our priest, in return...
...excuses his pranks
why take him?
Only on trial for a week
good night, gerard
get out!
At once!
I say so
where are you going?
Nowhere
go back, then
what have you come here for?
Looking for what's mine.
I'm no thief
clear off!
What's wrong?
Gerard's wonderful; he's got
everything ready for baking
you, gerard?
Me?
Don't deny it
you should ask
of course
if you need something, say so.
I don't want you to go short
i'd brought you a present,
to say thank you
look there
but i'll take it all back if
I see you with marie again
where were you?
Summons to the police station
i'll hide you
you can escape over the frontier
don't make fun of me
don't scorn my tears
why shouldn't I speak out?
You're on the wrong track
no one's asking you
they couldn't do it, those snotnoses
it's a frame-up
hand them over. You'll get them
back later
your thumbs
are you arresting me?
Not yet, but we're keeping
an eye on you
you can go
drop dead, bastard!
I won't answer. It concerns
my private life
your friends answered easily.
Can you explain that?
Explain that?
Is it up to me to explain?
Since you suspect me,
maybe i'm your man
what's that?
The murderer
how? When? Alone?
These gentlemen had no part in it
you said you'd never even thought
of smuggling
and you'd never been near
the frontier
I wanted to draw the fangs
of the police
enough of this
arrest him
i'm innocent
obstructing the law. Charge: Idiocy
get out!
What do you want?
You know too much about us, arnold
informer
get going
I defended you. Get going
you tried to involve us,
but you're the murderer
rubbish!
Rubbish? A drunk like you!
The next day you wouldn't
remember you'd done it
why do you think they
fingerprinted you?
Murderer
- why didn't they arrest me?
- The law moves slowly
how slowly?
Months. Maybe a year
liar!
Say that again
stop!
Coward
look how he's shivering
poor beast. Two months
and no improvement
it'll soon be over
stop!
Murderer!
I'll take him off your hands
he's incapable of getting up
i'll take him
the road could have killed him,
but it cured him
...a multitude of structures
on my canvas...
...each with its own dialectic,
beyond my control
I don't see a waterfall,
it dictates to me...
...without any logical harmony
between us
its fall activates me
a sort of thought painter?
An action painter
can one be held responsible for
an unwitting crime?
Something one doesn't remember
consciously...
...because of the effects of stress
or drink?
The "unconscious" conceals everything...
...and the criminal doesn't know
he is one
not the scaffold. My poor head
I swear by the virgin, jesus
and all the saints...
...that I will never drink again
afraid? Afraid of what?
Fear...
you're crazy to leave at the height
of the season
misfortune-harbouring devil!
Don't leave the court, I beg you
he's insulting me
a real court wouldn't allow me
to be insulted
if you leave the court...
...they'll find you guilty by default
i'll take him on
- a waste of time
- he's the height of intelligence
an absolute genius?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...it is our privilege to present
the brain of the century
will someone give me
a three-figure number?
834
now any number from 2 to 9
three
now our mathematician will do
multiplication
now a five-figure number
run for it while there's still time!
Too late. Look who's here
you fool to come back!
Luckily i've brought a gun
empty
get up, arnold. I've great news
for you
the drinks are on arnold!
Arnold's standing treat!
Has he really come into money?
Thanks to his uncle's will,
arnold's inherited a tidy sum
the will is valid, no doubt of that
just a few formalities
- I knew you'd come
- why not?
You spy on me
I wanted to know what you were doing
what do you see in that boy?
I love him
you can't explain love.
I do whatever he says
poor child
i'd follow him anywhere,
and if he asked me...
...i'd kill myself for him
not breaking anything?
Aren't you worked up?
Drink, half-wit!
You social parasite
your father suffers.
He lives only for us
he loves his sorrows more than
he loves us
I appeal to you for the last time
come home with me
or you'll be forced to come back
save me! Take me a long way away
your father will kill you
father's sick of me
if you want her, pay
are you leaving us, arnold?
Good-bye, friend
condemned to stay here for ever...
...seeing the same fools go by
good-bye, old mate
and you, comrade...
the death certificate was sent
two weeks ago
if there's no heir, we'll sell off
his belongings
to the market
he needs proper harness
not worth it. I'll scrap him
in the autumn
don't turn me away
have you no shame? Go to
your father's house
I can't and I won't
you've dishonoured him
i've finished with gerard's lot.
I can't stand them any more
just let me sleep in the straw
how kind you are
if you like...
...i'll kiss you
dry yourself
give me your things
- no one saw you come here?
- No one
what a dingy place
a place to die in
nothing to regret
who's talking of dying?
I am. Do you believe in anything?
Yes, in what i've got.
I love money, hate death
but you'll die, like everyone
i'll outlive them all
you're old
not so old
you're ugly
let me eat, old miser! I'm starving
they say you hide your gold
in your boots
what's the good of that?
Take it!
You're rich and you've got
no electricity
we've got nothing at all.
Even the house is not ours
father paid every penny
to the creditors
that's what happens when
you put honour first
your father spent his life
creating obligations
for what? Not one person in ten
believes him innocent
have I got any obligations?
I'm free, obliged only to
what's useful to me...
...things which give profit,
especially big profit
life is a fair, a market
which doesn't need words
banknotes will do
if you pay people, you're excused
obligations to them
it would be even better
if they worked for nothing
not everyone sees things
the same way
you can do what you like
and still be respected
it's a matter of cheek,
self-assurance
take it back
I don't need money; I need a friend
who'll give me what I need to escape
i've always wanted to
escape?
Run away
a friend who will share
my pleasures and sorrows
i'll share them, but I hope i'll
have more pleasure than sorrows
she was here an hour ago
you gave her food and shelter
she ate
she'll come back, like a long-iost child
yes, you'll be reconciled
he's not young, but he's a good worker
take him. Marie will be pleased
I haven't forgotten what I owe you...
...though it's only a trifle
more than a trifle
take him and we're quits
my daughter
everything ruined, on the point
of success
everything swept away
in such a short time
things must be put right
how?
My father wants to return the
damages the court awarded
my father won't accept them. He's
locked up in his pride; struck dumb
jacques, how often i've dreamt
of someone like you
someone honest, a bit silly,
who'll say to me:
"Come with me. It's not your fault"
what's not your fault?
Enough to shock you, drive you mad
now i've told you everything
and you want to marry me?
Too late. You'll be ashamed of me
will you never blame me?
Never
you'll take me for ever?
But, jacques, marriage...
it's out of date
anyway, we'll be married. We'll be
poor, but i'll work hard
you're such a bore
calm down
you still see this bench, balthazar,
everything as it was
but I see nothing. I've no affections,
no heart
your words have no effect on me
our childish declarations of love...
...they were just fantasy, not reality
reality is different
I will love him
I don't want him to be late
don't go to them
I want to have it out,
once and for all
stripped, beaten and locked in
marie has gone
she'll never come back
he's in despair, comfort him
there must be forgiveness for all
you will be greatly forgiven
on account of your suffering
perhaps I suffer less than you think
for the lord will not cast off for
ever: But though he cause grief
he will have compassion according
to the multitude of his mercies
for he doth not afflict willingly
nor grieve the children of men
dear god, don't take him from me, too
you know how miserable my life will be
let's borrow him
he's worked enough. He's old
and he's all I have
just for a day
what's more, he's a saint
perfumes
stockings
gold
