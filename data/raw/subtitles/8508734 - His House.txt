This is bail, Mr. and Mrs. Majur.
You're being released on bail
as asylum seekers.
Not as citizens, not yet.
You both understand?
Until then, you'll be subject
to certain conditions.
If you fail to meet these,
even just the once,
you'll be returned to detention.
Your case may be disqualified
and you'll be sent back.
Do you understand?
Okie-dokie. All right, conditions.
You will be reviewed
and must report to us weekly.
You must not miss a single report.
A yes, if you understand, please.
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes.
You will be given financial weekly support
of 74 pounds in total.
You do not have permission to work
or to supplement your earnings
by any other means.
A yes, if you understand, please.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Final condition. You will be sent
to a home of our choosing.
You must reside at this address.
You must not move from this address.
This is your home now.
A yes, if you understand.
We are good people.
A yes, if you understand.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Whether or not you're good people,
it's not me that needs convincing.
Where are we going?
[man] All right.
Do you speak English?
[Bol] Yes.
All right. [sighs]
This is for you.
Here we are, then.
Home sweet home. Amazing, innit?
It's a palace.
Normally, it should be half the size
with twice as many of you in it, but...
[sniffs]...this is all yours.
This is... this is all for you.
Why are we so special?
You must've won the jackpot.
Shit.
All right, a few ground rules.
Uh... no candles, no smoking,
no animals.
- Uh...
- [clinks]
- [flipping switch]
- Oh...
We'll fix that. No pets,
no guests, no friends, no parties.
No ball games, no games, no balls.
Uh...
Get some screws for your door.
There's a shop round the corner.
Uh, say hello to your neighbors
and that, and...
Yeah, you'll be all right.
[clicking]
Didn't have time
to get the cleaners, but...

[flies buzzing]
There's a doctor down the road.
I'll draw you a map.
I wouldn't worry about the smell.
Open a window, the place should air out.

[undoes cuff]
Those are pretty.
These I've had since I was a little girl.
Mm.
These I gave to myself with a knife.
When I found my family butchered.
There are two tribes where I'm from.
They're both killing each other.
Depending on which one you belong to,
you mark yourself.
I marked myself with both.
I survived by belonging nowhere.
We lost her.

I have seen jobs here.
They give you a chance here.
We can start a family.
I am restless.
My mother used to tell me a story.
In our village, there was once
an honorable but poor man
who wanted a home of his own.
He wanted it so badly,
he began to steal from others.
One day...
he stole from an old man
who lived by the river.
He didn't know that this man was an apeth.
A night witch.
And so the thief could not know
that when he built his home...
the apeth, too, would live there.
So, before long,
the walls would whisper
the spells of the apeth.
From the shadows...
the dead would come.
The apeth would not stop...
until he had consumed the man entirely.
An apeth has arisen from the ocean.
It has followed us here.
It spoke to me.
- [loud clattering sound]
- [heavy thump]
[sighs] What did it say?
We don't belong here.
If we leave...
and repay our debt...
[sobs]
...it would guide us back to her.
[gasps]
To Nyagak.
[sobs]
[breathing shakily]
She's gone.
My love, she's gone.
- The sea took her.
- You're not listening.
- We survived.
- [in Dinka] If we missed something...
English!
- I will speak my mother's language.
- Listen to what you are saying.
- [in Dinka] She lives!
- She's dead!
- [yells in Dinka]
- [crockery breaks]
[Bol yells in Dinka]
[in English]
We have grieved enough. Enough.
There is no witch.
I had assured myself it was a dream.
Perhaps I am...
[breathes shakily]...overwhelmed...
imagining things that aren't there.
But now I have looked into your eyes.
You're a liar.

My husband's been chasing it

It's filling this house with ghosts.
It torments my husband
with visits from her.
Nyagak.
But my husband is a very stubborn man.
He still believes he can deny it.
You should put that into your report.

And then you thank them
for the unseasoned scraps they throw us.
You eat them up.
Let them send us back.

We're going back.
I'm leaving. With or without you.

You seem well.
[footsteps climbing stairs]
[Mark] Is there still a witch?
Rial killed it.
[chuckles]
I think I might paint this room red.
Hm.
Are you completely mad?
What about the rats?
- [shutter clicks]
- Perhaps I was being a little dramatic.
Do you still see her?
Nyagak?
Your ghosts follow you.
They never leave.
They live with you.
It's when I let them in,
I could start to face myself.
This is our home.
We are happy here.
[man] They shouldn't be using a barbecue.
[woman] And they shouldn't be
doing that to the walls.
All right, then.
That'd be all.
[man] Right.
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Majur.
