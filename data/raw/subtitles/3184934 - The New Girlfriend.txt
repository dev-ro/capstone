A NEW FRIEND
Laura was my best friend,
my friend forever.
Since we met
it was like a crush.
Because she was and I was.
We had seven years ...
and it sure would be for
life to death.
I present to your
new partner,
Laura.
Well, we were in
the grammar lesson,
with verbs of the first group.
Who can give me examples
verbs of the first group?
All life to death.
All life to death.
All life to death.
All they look.
Hi Laura.
Are you okay?
What's up?
May the Lord confirm
this decision ...
and give them his Spirit to
I serve as a common agreement,
and that your union be blessed
in the name of the Father and of the Son ...
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.
United by the bonds
marriage
with from now on,
as a guarantee of your alliance,
these rings.
In the name of the Father ...
and of the Son ...
and the Holy Spirit.
Laura ...
And as in our childhood ...
We made a pact.
I made a promise.
This promise, Laura,
I'll keep it for you.
I will be all my life ...
ensuring your daughter Lucie ...
and his father, David.
For the Father, his son
and the Holy Spirit.
It's time, Claire.
Come on, get up.
I do not want to go.
Yes, make an effort.
You work, you
think of something else.
You agree?
See you tonight.
Until tonight.
Sorry.
It is done!
Bravo.
Do not you feel good?
Yes, but I wanted to tell you ...
I took a week's leave.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.
I can not work,
not concentrate.
Do not apologize dear,
I understand you.
You called David?
No.
You could take this
week to go see him.
Help you with your daughter.
I'm afraid of ...
to see Lucie.
It reminds both Laura.
Thanks for dinner.
Barely touched your plate.
- It was very good.
- Thank You.
- Do you want to do it?
- But yes.
- Are you sure?
- Sure, why ask?
<I> Hi, is David,
I'm away, but ... </ i>
Is there someone?
Good morning lady I ...
Sorry, just passing by,
I do not want to bother.
Wait, Claire ...
Stay, I must explain.
There is nothing to explain,
You do what you want.
Please, you must listen.
I'm going to bed the girl
and I'll be back.
Sit, drink something,
I'll be right back.

NEWSPAPER OF THE HOUSE
101 recipes to delight
And I went to bed.
I'm going to have a drink.
First of all,
I want you to know ...
Laura knew.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes
I know you had everything,
but this kept secret.
Before we got married ...
I confessed that ...
sometimes I liked
dressed as a woman.
Only that, as a game.
For pleasure.
He accepted it very well.
All he asked me ...
It was not to do it in public.
Then now
she's dead ...
Claire ...
I never left this house
dressed as a woman.
Nobody saw me as well.
Unless you today.
It was an accident.
In all this time
with Laura ...
He did not feel the need.
Her presence, her femininity,
I sated.
He loved her so much.
It was after his death
he returned ...
as evidence.
<I> started a week later
Laura's funeral. </ i>
<I> was alone with Lucie
in my room ... </ i>
<I> trying to give him his bottle ... </ i>
<I> but I would not stop screaming. </ I>
<I> For two days
barely fed. </ i>
<I> In that moment I understood
I missed Laura. </ i>
<I> How I missed her. </ I>
This shirt is from Mom.
<I> And suddenly ... </ i>
<I> the pain of his absence ... </ i>
<I> his fault, disappeared. </ I>
<I> The scent of Laura ... </ i>
<I> his clothes ... </ i>
<I> a feeling of fullness
I was overwhelmed ... </ i>
<I> like I was there. </ I>
<I> She spoke to me ... </ i>
Lucie.
<I> was inside me. </ I>
Wait.
Being alone with a child
to raise is very hard.
I think that ...
I could give you a
maternal presence.
Every child needs a mother.
And a father.
I do both.
It is temporal.
Only a less brutal form
leaving Laura.
To get used to his absence.
You do not do for Lucie.
It's for your own pleasure.
you are a pervert.
Maybe you're right.
Please, Claire.
Do not tell anyone, not to Gilles.
Just between us.
I do not know ...
If Laura's parents find out,
I care Lucie removed.
- You know how much I love her.
- Yes, I know ...
I want you to understand
as always he understood me Laura.
No goals Laura in all this!

Y? What did you do today?
- Nothing special.

Yes ...
- To a friend.
- Yes? Who?
You do not know her,
a fellow high school.
- Did you know Laura?
- Yes, a little.
What you how did it go?
There was more.
- Not to get orders.
- Best.
- I did not tell you.
- What?
I called David.
- David ...
- As there beckoned, I did.
I suggested going to dinner
together on Saturday.
So we distendemos a little.
What did he say?
Which in principle would be fine,
You should only get a babysitter.
He told me that since the death
Laura he never left.
- When did you call?
- A while ago.
It is for you.
You do not answer?
Yes.

Then I'll see.
Who is it?
That childhood friend of

The same eyes.

I'll get her bottle.
It's nothing, it's nothing ...
Mom turns away.
- What happens to you?
- It's ridiculous.
This can not last forever.
it's crazy.
I know, but found
Nothing better.
- And your work?
- Paternity leave.
Laura's father told me
I take my time.
Why not take someone?
A full-time nanny.
Lucie would have a
female presence and ...
No, Laura promised care
it myself.
I also.
And watch over you.
It's what you're doing today.
Do you think you told him to Fuiste
Gilles to call me?
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.
I have a lot of sewing to do
and I ordered dresses online.
My dream would be to go
boutiques women,
do shopping and
buy large sizes.
But I never dared.
Laura had tons of clothes.
You can take whatever you want.
- Will not you stay with anything?
- Yes, but kids sizes.
I gain nothing.

But in here
it's a little hot.
You should touch the shoulders.
But I look good, right?
Yes, rather.
I personally am
against the skin.
It's an old animal.
It was my mother.
Did you keep a coat
of your mother?
If, as I recall.
I loved my mother.
This dress also.
- Is it because of it?
- Because of it, what?
- That you dress as a woman.
- No, I think not.
As a child I loved to dress up.
Especially not with her clothes.
Yes ... with your clothes

What are you doing?
You like it?
I look like an old whore.
No, you exalted.
Did you get a nanny?
Better yet, let Lucie

For one week.
He will do well to take
a little time for me.
It is exactly what
I tell Claire.
- Time is very important.
- But I'm scared.
Why?
Care of Lucie

We will support.

Will you go to Virginia?
- How to Virginia?

It would be nice as Virginia.
Now comes, shut up.
Come with your car at 14 pm.
I'll open the garage.
I love him to David,
He's a good guy.
No?
- What's up?
- Nothing.
- Yes, I see ...
- You were odious to the waitress.
What?
David comes from losing his wife
and incite to flirt.
I just wanted to defuse the atmosphere.
He did not take it badly.
Anyway ...
He saw that he was not interested.
I always thought
I was a little ...
A little what?
He has something. is very ...
- Female. it feels ...
- Oh, good.
Yes. I'm sure Laura

We could go to his house.
It is not impossible.
What would you say to Gilles?
The truth.

This scarf is mine.
I found there.
My throat hurts.
Charming.

On another occasion

He saw me out of the men's room.
You must have liked my dress.

- Yes, what?
For eye makeup ...

What room you take?
As you like.
I parents because
there is a beautiful wardrobe
and a large mirror.
- I'll take Laura.

It does not bother me.
You feel good?
Yes Yes.
At seeing these pictures,
Table, it gives me something.
Were moments of happiness?
Yes ...
That is important,
no sadness, only happiness.
Okay,
Are we going to walk?
Would you push you?
You see there?

We used to spend hours

We talked and played.
I can not find it.
- Are you sure it's here?
- Of course.
Here, look!
It was not erased.

I remember what you told us
when we were kids:
"The boys are born in a cabbage
and girls in a flower "
I ...
I was born in a cauliflower.
- What happens to you?
- Sorry, I did not recognize you.
I switched to fetch firewood.
It is more practical as a man.
Yes, of course.
This evening, you prefer to dine
with David or Virginia?
Whatever, I do not care.
Gilles, better than
either with Virginia.
Yes?
- I have a problem.
- Which?
You know.
Not much, it's worth?
You promised me.
Agree.
Is it too hot?
Yes, but the pores
They should expand.
- How much time is left?
- I do not know, 10 seconds.
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...
- 4. 5 ...
- Come on, pluck it out!
Are you okay?
You have to suffer to be beautiful.
Show me!
We should have done
some shopping.
No, it's delicious.
I feel good here.
I always dreamed of living
close to nature.
Have a calm life,
less stressful.
I should go away ...
I do not know where ...
and where it can restart
a new life ...
as a woman.
What is a woman's life?
A life ...
where you can do everything
I was forbidden to do as a man.
Did you think really?
Yes.
With Lucie, you know
it is impossible.
Yes, I know it's complicated.
But while there is love,
everything is possible.
You're dreaming.
it is only a game. You should stop
and return to reality.
But you also,
you like to play with me.
Before we were not very close,
but Virginia approached us.
No.
It was the death of Laura
that approached us.
So our
dear Laura.

<I> evenings in Daban

<I> They were just straw castles </ i>
<I> and wasting my time
gold in the desert. </ i>
<I> She was alone when I met you. </ I>
<I> The others were buried ... </ i>
<I> you were alive. </ I>
<I> sings sang as a child. </ I>
<I> You were happy as an Italian
when he knows that will </ i>
<I> love and wine. </ I>
<I> And for the first time </ i>
<I> finally felt ... </ i>
<I> woman ... </ i>
<I> woman ... </ i>
<I> a woman </ i>
<I> you. </ I>
<I> You had the air of a little old </ i>
<I> where galloping
white horses. </ i>
<I> Your face was serious
and clear your smile. </ i>
<I> I walked right
to your glow. </ i>
<I> Today, no matter what we do,
we love close to you </ i>
<I> time seems so short. </ I>

<I> A woman ... </ i>
<I> you ... </ i>
Are you okay?
Yes.
Are you tired?
No.
There's something I did not tell.
What?
When Laura died ...
at the funeral I was asked ...
what clothes I wanted
it was buried.
I proposed to
her wedding dress.
And I asked them out
I who dressed.
<I> are usually
them to do, </ i>
<I> but I insisted ... </ i>
<I> and accepted. </ I>
<I> I was left alone with Laura ... </ i>
<I> in the middle of a huge piece. </ I>
<I> He was cold and fear. </ I>
Then I remembered her smile
the day we met,
their eyes excited,
the day of our wedding,
wedding night.
He gave me courage.
<I> I started to put his socks. </ I>
<I> It's slipped ... </ i>
<I> delicately ... </ i>
<I> on her thighs. </ I>
<I> Then ... </ i>
<I> I put her blouse ... </ i>
I buttoned her dress,
I put her jewelry,
their shoes ...
and I pressed gently
<I> his wreath
in her blonde hair. </ i>
<I> It was there, I think ... </ i>
<I> that my desire to get
women's clothing ... </ i>
<I> reappeared ... </ i>
<I> as evidence. </ I>
- Good day.
- Hi.
Are you okay?
Did you sleep well?
Not very well.
I told you that bed
it was too small.
It's not that, it's Gilles.
What happened?
I left my cell phone in the bag
and I forgot to call.
He called my mother and she
He said he was not there.
Shit!
You spoke with him?
No. I left many messages,
I'm calling now.
- Are you going to say?
- What?
You're in Créancy with me.
And why should
to hide it?
You have nothing to reproach.
That's what's important.
I'll be right back.
- It's getting dangerous.
- What?
We must end.
Finish?
- Stop meeting?
- No.
To dress as a woman.
I thought you understood me.
You're sick, David.
You should treat yourself.
You're sleeping with David, is that it?
Of course not.
What are you saying?
So why do I hide
exiting the weekend together?
- He asked me not to tell you anything.
- Why?
Because you were right.
Wait ...
Any reason for what?
David found that ...
who likes men.
And so?
What's it to you?
Y ...
He needed to talk to me,
he feels guilty.
Why they were to Créancy
to tell you this?
Because there ... it feels good.

It will take time.
Do not worry.
I have the impression of being
living as with Laura.
In the same hospital.
It is horrible.
It's horrible, but leaves
looking back.
Forget about Laura.
Now it's David.
If you're right.
Now it's David.
I used to relate
something strange men,
as light as the
ash of his cigarette.
Evenings in Daban
Palace of Versailles.
It was only straw castles
and wasting my time
gold in the desert.
She was alone when I met you.
The others were buried ...
you were alive.
You sang as a child singing.
You were happy as an Italian
when you know you will
Love and wine.
And for the first time
I finally felt ...
woman ...
woman ...
a woman
you.
Woman ...
woman ...
a woman ...
you.
You had a little the air of yesteryear
where galloping
white horses.
Your face was serious
and your clear smile.
I walked right
to your glow.
Today, no matter what
We do, make love,
near you time
It seems so short.
Because you're a man
and tender are
and you know make beautiful
our lives.
You're happy as an Italian
when you know you will
Love and wine.
It is always like
the first time when ...
when I finally did it ...
woman ...
woman ...
a ...
She has fun ...
We are here!
Who is it?
- Good night, Gilles.
- Goodnight.
I want you to meet a friend.
But ...
you, David.
No, my friend Virginia.
She is the mother of Lucie.
Lucie's mother.
I'll explain.
I'll be back.
