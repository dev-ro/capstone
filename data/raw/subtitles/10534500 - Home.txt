Don't break it, dear.
Is this enough?
Are you full?
Oh, okay.
Now stop your knocking.
God...
-What happened, Dad? Difficult to walk?
-No. Never.
I will get you some tea.
-Wanted two tomatoes also.
-They are not ripe.
-What?
-No ripe ones.
Hey, no!
Damn...
Tired of telling this guy.
Throws it right into the water every day.
[Ad for mobile phone]
[Ad for mobile phone]
Sitting as if he doesn't know
what happened.
God! Where do all the teacups
in this house disappear?
Mom...
Papa...
If he doesn't trouble us...
Kuttiyamma...
...he won't get peace.
I didn't do it because it is painful.
We are going to connect a tube.
I am fed up of doing this.
Cleaning your piss every morning.
I am weaker than you, Dad.
He has memory loss.
Leave it...
Can't you go to the toilet
when you feel like peeing?
I'm very hungry...
...and tired.
I have walked...
...a long way.
Those memories are intact.
Kuttiyamma... Please...
Can you come here for a second?
This boy!
Mom...
With my ailing leg, I have to...
Dad...
I am not mad at you, Dad.
I am really tired.
Starts yelling in the morning...
...saying Mom-mom.
Yes, tell me...
Listen to me for a second.
It's just sore throat. Don't panic.
Don't panic unnecessarily, Surya.
Kuttiyamma...
Why are you screaming, boy?
Oh, are you here?
Switch off the fan and go.
What?
Switch off the fan and go.
Want me to switch it off?
Just you wait...
Oh, no!
Mom, I am freezing. Switch it off please.
Look who is here!
Can't you walk back to the kitchen
after tea, dear cups?
Mom, I will keep them back.
Can't find a cup when I want it.
Keep them in a row here.
Like antiques.
-Yeah.
-What?
How do you sleep in this room, dear?
See how messy this room is.
Where will he sleep when he comes?
He is not going to come here anymore.
He will marry
and settle down in Ernakulam.
Oh! Are you the one who decides that?
He told me.
Won't you bore him with such talk
if he comes home?
Oh, my God.
Jesus...
-God!
-What?
-What?
-What is that, dear?
Go and check.
Where are you? I was expecting you
in office this morning.
I was writing and lost track of time.
I will come right now.
No need. I am downstairs,
at your apartment.
I will come there.
-Good morning, Sir.
-Good morning.
I was getting ready to come there.
Looking like this? No kidding!
7.5 million rupees
at three percent interest...
How much would be the capital
and interest by now?
What's it, sir?
I was talking about the advance
that we had paid Vishal.
7.5 million rupees. 24 months ago...
I was just thinking how much interest
it would have racked up by now.
Only a small portion is left.
We can narrate after I write the climax.
Don't you have to dig up all the issues
happening here and post them on Facebook?
Between all that, how will you find time
to complete this?
Sir, the issue is...
What's the issue?
What's the issue?
No, you started telling me something.
Yeah, that's right.
I forgot.
Sir... I...
It's just that I have not written
the climax.
I am ready to narrate it to him anytime.
Is it any good?
It's terrific.
That's not self-praise.
It's terrific.
Really? Then let me call Vishal.
Hello.
Good morning, Vishal.
I am Baby, the producer.
Actor Baby.
The one who gave you
an advance of 7.5 million rupees.
You're right. The very same.
Yes, I just went over the script.
I can say it's just terrific.
I called you in the excitement.
Can we listen to it immediately?
In two days.
Shall we hear it?
He is refining the 'end punch'
of the climax.
Can you wait for two days?
Ask for... four days.
Still.. let us look at it
after the finishing touches.
And to make it perfect...
...it will take four days
with a buffer.
Okay. Will you be in Trivandrum
this Sunday?
Perfect!
So, we will be there on Sunday
to narrate the whole script. OK.
What's this mime
when I am talking on the phone!
That too when I am nervous.
Let me make one thing clear.
If there is a Sunday...
...whether you complete
the climax or not...
...you must go there and narrate it.
-Am I clear?
-Okay.
I will call you later.
I called you so many times.
You were online
till three in the morning.
I will call you back.
-I am in a meeting.
-Is it for the film?
Yes.
You didn't tell me that
you completed the script.
I will call you later.
Why are you hanging up so quickly?
Angry with me?
An unhygienic guy!
-Okay, I will call.
-I won't call you back.
Yeah, do whatever you want.
Antony...
Let me be frank with you.
Don't feel bad.
If you break this deadline too...
I will drop this project.
You must return the advance
you had received.
Because you are a director
whose debut film was a super hit...
...a busy star like Vishal
gave you open dates.
Two years have passed.
I have not done another film till now.
I can't hold off anymore.
So, try to complete writing
without wasting time.
Did you see that?
It is not hanging there for nothing.
Time is money. Money is everything.
Sir, don't make me more anxious.
I will complete it before the deadline.
We will rock.
See how dirty this place is.
Antony, this is not just your room.
It's your mind.
Do one thing.
Don't write the climax from here.
From where did you write
the script of your first film?
The sun rose from slumber
And delicately caressed my eyes
In this darkness enveloping the soul
What sheds a shimmer of light?
As I wandered seeking
the fantasy world of my dreams
Did I forget to cherish
the good times I left behind?
Even if times change
Even if I travel miles
My memory unknowingly seeks
That nest woven
with the thread of love
The sun rose from slumber
And delicately caressed my eyes
In this darkness enveloping the soul
What sheds a shimmer of light?
As I sat gazing at
the fantasy world before my eyes
Did I forget to cherish
That tiny house brimming with love?
Hello... how did the fish tank break?
I was calling to tell you.
How many times I tried calling you!
You didn't answer.
Instead of beating around the bush,
tell me how it broke.
Tank fell off when the stand broke.
How can the stand break?
He keeps knocking on it.
Water was dripping out.
It was rusted. We never saw it.
Luckily, it fell towards the back.
Dad was standing in the front.
Stop supervising
and throw this water away.
The room is flooded.
Your mom is still cleaning it.
Poor thing.
Oh! If you are feeling so bad,
come and do it yourself.
The container in which you put Mickey...
...please keep it closed.
Otherwise, the fish will jump out of it.
How did you see
that Mickey's container is open?
Hello...
Hey...
I'm asking how did you see
that Mickey's container is open?
Charles has put an Instagram story.
What is that? A story?
Okay, I will call you.
Now hang up.
Hello...
Hello!
Story?
What?
Where is he?
Our boy, Charles...
It seems he has put up an 'insternet'
story about our tank crash.
Oh.
-That was the only thing left.
-That too in great detail.
The story clearly shows
that Mickey's container is not closed.
Yeah.
What an example...
...of the power.
Story?
They have been doing this
since the last few days.
No idea what dance it is.
Some people make a living
out of these fads.
There was something on Instagram.
-Your tank crashed, right?
-What?
How did you come to know?
Well, your son makes a story
even out of what he does in the toilet.
Charles. We get to know everything!
Even Antony was talking about it.
What is this 'Story'?
Wow. This is wonderful stuff.
-Hey, dear.
-Hi, Dad.
-What's up, dear?
-Am good, Dad.
Here, see.
-Hi dear.
-Hi, Papa.
-How are you doing?
-Good.
-Where is the baby?
-She's here.
Yes, let me see her.
Oh, good.
You wear coat and suit
even inside the house?
Temperature is below zero.
It's really cold inside too.
-Oh!
-I'll call back after feeding her.
-Okay then.
-Don't hang up yet.
Dear, I have something important
to tell you.
I can't say this from home.
Your mom and sister will kill me.
You swallowed a fish-bone, didn't you?
I came to know.
Dear, it was not a silly fish-bone.
My throat bled, you know.
You just have to drink some water
and not put a toothbrush down your throat.
You are over thinking most of it.
You hang up.
All of you are the same.
I am over thinking, it seems.
Check this out.
See, yesterday this guy died of choking
while eating rice cake.
Can you believe it?
Amazing, isn't it?
The death, right?
No, if you want to see
your daughter and granddaughter...
You just need to click on this, right?
It has been so long since I saw my son.
Hello...
When?
Tell me what it is.
[Prayer on TV]
Yeah, tell me.
[Prayer continues]
I can hear you. Tell me.
[Prayer continues]
Move to a place
where you have better connectivity.
When did you come?
I can't hear you.
Mom, please reduce the volume
of the TV.
When did I say that?
Can't you see he is discussing
something serious?
Reduce the volume.
Hang up, you witch!
Enough bickering.
Shit.
Nuisance.
What were you saying earlier, Papa?
Nothing.
All this hair and beard...
Look at you!
When you called earlier,
you did not tell me that you were coming.
Did you eat something?
-Hey!
-Yeah.
Did you eat anything?
Mom, what's there to eat?
There is. But go and take a bath first.
Hey guys! Hope you liked today's video!
If you like it, please like, share
and subscribe!
If you want to get more wonderful videos
like this, bang the bell icon!
It's me Charles Oliver Twist
signing off. Bye-bye!
Hey, if someone beats you up,
will you vlog about it too?
When did you come, Director sir?
Hi...
What have you done to this room?
-Why? It's nice, isn't it?
-Yeah, right.
-Now get out. Quick!
-Don't throw me out, please.
See, to set up all these, I...
I have been trying to set up
the Wi-Fi, you know.
Did you change the password?
Yes, I did. Can't tell.
-What?
-Can't tell.
-Say it!
Can't tell. Just type c-a-n-t-t-e-l-l.
Can't tell. You should've said that.
Yeah, type it properly.
Thank you.
-Thank you!
-Take it off.
Give it to me.
-Eat the rice and curries.
-Here.
If you had told me you were coming,
I would've made some other dish too.
Want some more of this?
Have it.
Why did you move the fish tank?
It breaks because
you move it around often.
It's a hassle to move around
if you keep it there.
What about Papa's old table?
Well, we must keep all these somewhere!
Good. Now the mess is right in the front
for everyone to see.
Well, you come here rarely
and question us about this and that.
Staying far away,
how do you know what's happening here?
Hey, not when he is eating.
Didn't you see this when you came in?
Only we know how we survive each day.
Won't even answer the phone
when we call for some help!
Dear, come here. Finish this and go.
No, I am done.
Hey, come and sit here.
Okay, eat this sapodilla from our garden.
Okay.
Grandpa bro, how are we
on the urine front?
-Clear and perfect.
-Amazing.
-Have this.
-Okay.
-Son...
-Yes.
How are things over there?
You can tell us also.
Nothing worth mentioning.
Don't we have to talk to Priya's parents?
Not so soon.
When will the time come, Antony?
You are not growing any younger.
Let me tell you all...
For the next seven days...
Please don't bring up such things
and disturb my mind.
I've got work to do.
Got it? Please.
What's this, Kutti?
I can't utter a word to anyone!
Not in the right mind, it seems!
What's this?
Can't parents talk to their children?
Don't take it out on me.
Tell your elder son.
Does he let me talk?
He gets mad at me!
You should've told him tactfully!
Tactfully, it seems.
Dad, want some stir fried veggies?
Did he tell you something?
Anything about his life there?
Between brothers,
we discuss a lot of things.
Why do you want to know all that?
Oh, the best siblings!
Wait.
He must complete the script
in seven days.
If he doesn't narrate the completed script
to Vishal, the producer won't spare him.
Was saying something like that.
[The film "Malena" playing]
Not slept yet?
No.
Has he gone to bed?
Saw light in his room.
Usually when he is at home...
...he would kiss us good night
before going to bed.
He must be stressed out.
Must be having lots to write.
I looked around to see the sunshine
Hopin' all my dreams to shine in light
Waitin' for the time to be my side
Home is the place where I belong
Good morning, Antony.
Is your writing going well?
Don't mind me troubling you every day.
We have only six days left.
Carry on.
Home is the place where I belong
When sky-high ambitions
are sown in this soil
It appears before me, as in a mirror
Can I shut my eyes to it?
How many times did I call you?
Expect me to know that you are home
by seeing your 'story'?
I don't know why I am being
ignored like this.
I won't trouble you anymore.
I am leaving. Bye.
I mean it. Bye.
Even if I shut my eyes
Everything comes to light
Even if I turn a deaf ear
Everything is heard
Oh! What bothers my mind
Oh! What racks my brain!
When will this fate change?
What could be its cure?
Is this house turning into a tale?
Even if the times change
Even if I travel miles
My memory unknowingly seeks
That nest woven with the thread of love
Tired of wiping it clean.
Sir, want to check out
some new mobile phones?
Yeah, I want to.
Which is the latest fashion?
-We have many. Go through this.
-Papa...
Come and see the tank.
I've got other things to do.
-I'll be back
-Okay.
-Papa, this is the tank.
It looks good. Let's pick this.
Show it to your brother
and ask if this is okay.
You guys shouldn't argue
after we take it home.
To show him, I should
bring him here, right?
Don't you have 'what soap'?
Make a video call and show him.
Yeah, right.
Hey, here it is...
This is the tank.
-Does it look okay?
-Do we need such a big one?
This comes with in-built filter and all.
-Fine. Go for it then.
-Okay.
Don't disconnect. Give it to me.
Hi son... Hi...
How is your writing going on?
Got a good climax to the story?
Papa, give him the phone.
Okay, Don't want to trouble you much.
Continue writing. Here, your brother.
That was my elder son. A film director.
He must complete the climax
in seven days and narrate it to Vishal.
The superstar, you know...
He rings him every day
to check if it's complete.
What to do?
Get Papa out of that place now, man.
Papa, shall we go?
Leela, can't you tell your
daughter-in-law to clean the fish?
What can I say, Kuttyamma!
She doesn't enter the kitchen.
She can't stand the smell of fish,
it seems.
Does she eat it?
She eats it once it's cooked.
No problem with that.
Don't wet your hand today.
What happened to your hand?
Happened while cutting fish, dear.
Mom said you're writing.
Got the climax?
He's got five or six. Yet to decide
which one to go with.
Right, son?
Yeah.
Dear, can you get my son a job?
He is roaming around jobless.
Get him some work in films.
Carry lights, acting or something...
-Tank is here.
-I will see about it.
Dear, the tank is delivered.
Oops. Walk carefully.
Why does everyone check the fridge?
The other one checked it a minute back.
Be it fridge or phone...
...even if you know it's empty,
...you feel sad
if you don't check it often.
Really? Go away.
It's the same size you had told me.
Take it out carefully. This way.
I watched your last film.
It was superb.
Got the climax of your new film?
-Yeah.
-Vishal is the hero, right?
-That will rock.
-Okay, come.
Your father had told me.
Continue with your writing.
I will manage this.
Brother, can I take a selfie?
Watch the step.
Get in carefully.
Hey.
-What is it, man?
-Call for you.
Who is it?
Priya's dad.
The cover photo is beautiful.
Annammachi drew it.
Oh, Annammachi drew it?
No wonder, your bald head
looks so perfect in this.
She worked really hard for this.
I pushed her to do it.
-Daddy, I am leaving.
-What?
You said you weren't going out today.
Got to go to the library.
Oh.
Daddy, shall I leave then?
What's wrong?
Got to deal with some
'domestic violence'.
Carry on.
-Hey, leaving already? Have tea.
-No, mom. I am in a hurry.
-Let him go.
-Okay.
He can drink tea here anytime.
Priya, let me drop you.
Expect me to fly back?
You guys are busy people.
May not get time to drop me back.
What is all this?
I will take you there.
I will drop you back as well.
Hello Kichu.
I am on my way.
Give me 10 minutes.
You are at home, right?
No, man...
I am alone.
Cool. Okay.
Why are you going to
that mad man's house?
You said you were
going to the library.
Have you turned deaf?
Jesus.
I want to give daddy a surprise
on his birthday.
He said we will make a video
combining messages from everyone.
I am meeting him for that.
Perfect guy for the job indeed!
You were the one who said he's sleazy.
Now you are going to his home?
Okay, I won't go.
You edit it for me.
I am not going.
Just edit it for me.
-Why? Can't do it?
-I will do it.
It's okay if you can't.
I will make him do it.
I said I will do it.
Don't take the trouble.
You guys are busy people.
Good Lord!
I will do it.
See.
Talking as if you are fed up.
Anto, you are talking as if
these are annoying commitments.
I didn't mean it.
But your expression says it all.
Then, don't look at my face.
Okay?
I am going through a lot.
You are rubbing it in.
Expression!
Hey, why are you crying now?
Did I say anything to make you cry?
Honey...
You're my everything...
You're my sweetheart...
You're my world...
I'm happy when
you are around me...
Are these my messages?
Anto, you don't remember
any of these, do you?
When you used to miss me...
...or when you were sad,
you would call me first.
I miss the way you used to be.
Yes, Sir.
How is it going?
Are you heading towards the climax?
Yes, moving forward.
Is it almost done?
Yeah, close to that.
See, didn't I tell you?
Didn't I tell you that if you go home and
write in peace, it will be done.
You were right.
-Excellent, right?
-Of course.
Don't forget.
It's on Sunday.
On Sunday, let's narrate it well and
somehow launch the project.
-Do it as fast as you can, okay?
-Sure.
Don't cry like this, dear.
It's a small thing. I will edit.
I will make the video.
No need...
Relax.
Don't cry.
I will edit it, okay?
On the occasion of
the 50th birthday...
...of Joseph Lopez...
...we extend our hearty birthday wishes.
-And...
-What?
We wish him many more years of
good health and happiness.
Wow, what timing.
Are you making this like a movie?
Show it to Papa too, dear.
It's not ready for you to see, Papa.
Joseph does not know about it, right?
Do you tell the person before
giving him a surprise?
Right.
He gives his 'Daddy' surprises.
Give Papa and Mamma
too some surprise, son.
See this and tell me if it's good.
What's this, a phone?
Yeah.
What about the one you have?
That I have. Still...
Like you have, a phone
on which I can touch and call.
What? A smart-phone?
-Yup
-Aha.
My son is a famous filmmaker...
Won't it look bad
if I carry an ordinary phone?
It won't be easy
for you to use, Papa.
Well, I will know only if I try.
You guys will teach me, won't you?
-Isn't this our Joseph?
-Yup.
It's his autobiography.
When did it come out?
I didn't see.
It's not yet released.
It will be announced at
his 50th birthday event.
These days, a lot of people
are writing such stuff.
It's just show off.
Not everyone can write it.
Do you think you can write
something like this, Papa?
If I make up my mind, I will.
Why not?
What do you have to write about?
Something extraordinary
should have happened in life.
After that, a book can be written.
Oh, as if your Daddy is extraordinary...
Without doubt. He is 10-12 years
younger than you.
You know his stature, right?
Just search for Joseph Lopez
in Google.
Two or three PhDs...
So many followers on Facebook...
See this page?
Take a look.
His achievements...
Papa, your biography
won't be half the size.
We can give it a flashy name though.
"I, Oliver Twist!"
I used to run a shop.
I had to close it down because
I couldn't change with the times.
I sit idle these days
looking after my terrace garden.
What more can you write?
It can't fill even half a page.
Bro...
Oh!
What was that sound?
What's this, man?
Won't Dad feel sad?
Easy, man. Papa feeling sad?
No way.
What?
What is that?
-A dog.
-What?
Oh, you scared me.
"I, Oliver Twist."
"I used to run a shop."
"I had to close it down because
I couldn't change with the times."
"I sit idle these days
looking after my terrace garden."
He may not have
meant anything by it.
Still, I couldn't sleep
after he said that.
It was like over 60 years of
my life was nothing.
So what? Are you going to
write a story?
Oliver Twist's autobiography?
For that...
Do we have any extraordinary
incidents in our lives?
Oops!
What, man?
What?
Are you sure
there is nothing extraordinary?
Try to recollect.
There must be something.
Oh. Got startled!
What happened, man?
We too had an extraordinary event
in our life, dude.
Dammit! Will you wake me up at midnight
to tell your extraordinary bullshit?
Damn.
Thought you got killed or something.
Hang up, you fool.
See how she is sleeping!
She won't hear even if an atom bomb
falls, sleeps like a corpse!
Mom...
Mom, saw my yellow T-shirt?
Mom, did you see my yellow Puma T-shirt?
Yes, I saw.
It ate two Dosas and stepped out.
Nice joke.
Papa, did you see my yellow T-shirt?
What the... Papa!!
You got only my Puma T-shirt
of 3000 rupees to wipe the pee?
Sorry, son.
Yikes! Papa!
Bro is ordering a phone upstairs.
Tell him to buy me a T shirt as well.
Oh, surprise!
Ah, Mr. Oliver.
-Come in.
-Is Suryan here?
He is inside. He was startled out of sleep
at night because of a phone call.
He has been rubbing his chest fearing
a stroke, heart attack or something.
Wow, which phone is this?
Looks good. Which one is this, dear?
One minute, Papa.
What happened, man?
Drink this. You will feel better.
Shall I bring tea for you, brother?
No, I just had tea.
What happened to you, man?
Waking up abruptly from sleep
can cause heart attack.
He saw it on Facebook.
What is it now?
Oh, it's just an ant. Drink it.
What if it enters my lungs from my throat,
bites and cause internal bleeding?
Give it back. Don't drink it.
Just sit there.
Hey, make another cup of coffee.
Without ant.
Hey. Why fear an ant so much?
It's good for the eyes.
Get coffee for him as well.
With ant.
-You were right, man.
-What?
He didn't mean what he said.
He has booked a new phone.
To surprise me.
Really? I told you!
Why did you call and scare me at midnight?
Had a narrow escape from a stroke.
You and your stroke!
Listen to me.
How did we forget this incident?
It happened some 47 years ago.
Natural that we have forgotten it.
When I think of that day,
it still gives me the chills.
What did Antony say
after hearing this?
I didn't tell him.
He must have been joking.
-I dropped it.
-No, that wasn't a joke. Don't drop it.
You must tell him.
Should I?
You must.
Dear.
Are you busy?
No.
Didn't you ask, if Papa had
any extraordinary incident in life?
There is one event.
-Hey.
-Yeah, tell me. One second.
-Yes.
-Hey.
-Are you busy?
-No, tell me.
Did you order it?
Booking will close now.
I did it sometime back and sent
you a screen-shot. Check.
Oh, I missed it. Sorry.
Anyway, it will be a big surprise
for daddy.
Tell him that we both pooled
money and bought it, okay?
Why? Is it a shame to say that
his son-in-law bought him a phone?
Tell him what you like.
Send me a photo of daddy's reaction
when he gets the phone.
Sure thing.
He is so tech savvy.
Curious to know how he likes it.
The mind yearned to touch the cloud
Yet I stand with my wings numbed
A distant past stands afar, muted
Without a clue, aching
Nearby, does it feel like a petal falling
From a blossoming flower of love
Tell me, oh mind
Are the buds of lasting bonds
Disappearing somewhere afar?
Hello...
Did you tell him, man?
What?
Did you tell Antony our story?
Nope.
Do whatever you want.
Bruised by your words for the first time
My soul aches like summer fire
Even as I longed to see you daily
You fade away somewhere afar.
Your fingers entwined in mine
You sought new dawns in this journey
The din has died down and I am alone
Will you come
To fill my lovely nest?
The mind yearned to touch the cloud
Yet I stand with my wings numbed
A distant past stands afar, muted
Without a clue, aching
Nearby, does it feel
Like a petal falling
From a blossoming flower of love
Tell me, oh mind
Are the buds of lasting bonds
Disappearing somewhere afar?
In this, can I get WhatsApp and
Facebook in installments?
What? You want WhatsApp and
Facebook in installments?
-You meant Instagram, right?
-Yes.
You will get it, sir. It has 16GB.
Only 16GB?
Life is difficult these days
if you don't have at least 32GB.
Dear sir, I have models from 32 to 128GB.
But in a different range.
Will be a bit expensive.
No, I don't want that. This will do.
4000 itself is too much for me.
You must round off the price
and give it at 2000.
That is as good as
giving it to you free.
That's up to you. What say?
Yeah.
Sorry, sir.
Wipe it, man.
What's this leak?
It's not leaking, sir.
I got it checked by many people.
We couldn't find why.
During the rains...
There will be tiny drops of water.
But there is no water
accumulating on top.
Don't you have a bathroom inside?
-Do you use it?
-Yes.
That's why it happens.
-But sir...
-Stop using it. This problem will stop.
The water line to the bathroom
is not passing through the top.
It need not be that. This is...
...when a liquid flows against gravity...
...and enters through tiny holes...
...it either goes up or down.
That's the phenomenon.
It's called Capillary Action.
I have given you an additional
250 rupees discount.
-I won't get anything if I reduce further.
-Okay.
It's okay.
How did you know about
the bathroom here?
How it was in those days!
People used to come from even
15 kilometers away looking for cassettes.
In that era, a video cassette shop
was quite a phenomenon.
Here you go.
See this.
Just a minute.
Amazing, man.
This has everything!
This is nothing.
Want to pay electricity bill?
Want to book cooking gas?
Or want to recharge your phone?
You can do all that with this.
But telling the story...
I don't think that can be done.
It's better if you do that
in person.
Antony is home 24 hours a day.
After all, he is your son.
-In person?
-Yes.
When someone calls him on the phone
he is jovial and lively.
If I say something
he just responds with grunts.
And this is not just another story, man.
He will listen attentively if I
narrate through this.
Hey guys, it's me. Your Charles
from the channel Charlz Techy
Sorry, guys. I goofed up.
It's your own channel's Charlz Techy,
coming with a new video!
Woo-hoo!
Dude, go howl somewhere else.
Let me finish what I'm writing.
Don't you have a room inside?
Go sit inside and write, man.
Well, guys... Many of you commented
on my last video asking me...
Whether I use any pesticides.
Well... No guys.
This is the result of my hard work.
50 odd subscribers are all that you have.
Who asked this, man? Tell me.
Tell me.
Spoiled my mood to make a video.
Dammit.
Why are you late?
Treasury was crowded.
It's short of 2000 rupees.
Will return it next month.
You have been taking
1000 and 2000 multiple times.
What was this for?
I bought a new phone.
What?
First, switch off that damn thing.
Then I will tell you.
What did you say?
I bought a smart-phone, dear.
Oh!
Hi guys, it's me.. Your Charlz.
If you are watching this video...
It's for you. Parcel.
Fast delivery.
Here.
Beautiful, dear. I don't have this colour.
God! Oppo F15? Thank you, bro.
Not for you.
-Then?
-That gimbal is for you.
Here. Director's father should not say
he doesn't have a smart-phone.
Wow!
Dear...
-Open it.
-Okay.
Open the box.
Is it ringing even before
opening the box?
It's not from that phone.
It's coming from Papa's pocket.
Ew! A local brand?
When did you buy it?
Just now...
Some local brand...
Anyway, since you liked
and bought it...
Don't waste it. Use it.
Then this.
Don't worry thinking that
this will go waste.
I will use it.
You have bought a phone now.
Do you know how to use it?
He will make me climb the stairs
with my swollen legs...
This boy is too much!
What?
Why, man?
Can't I sit with my son
for five minutes?
You won't come and
sit just like that.
Oh, then I will leave.
Why? Not leaving?
Why dear?
This is so childish.
Why do you talk to Papa like this?
I did not say anything.
He is just fulfilling some of his
wishes in his old age.
He will use only the one
that you bought for him.
I've set everything up. Here you go.
Set up WhatsApp too for me.
Give me a break, Papa.
I have work to do.
Then get me Facebook.
What? Facebook... WhatsApp... Chat...
So you're here with
a year's syllabus to trouble me.
Hey...
At least tell me how to
pay the electricity bill.
First, you should open the
bill payment app.
One minute.
Press the E symbol on the third page.
The third page?
Didn't you slide and change
the page thrice?
Oh, no!
Then enter this number.
Dear...
Don't be mad at me for asking this.
Okay.
Now got it?
Better to go directly to the electricity
office and make the payment.
Right. You will find it easier, Papa.
Moreover... This has YouTube...
Blog, vlog, Facebook status,
Instagram story...
DP, tag, hash-tag, like, dislike...
Comment, share, followers,
subscribers, troll...
Smart-phone has thousands of such things.
In all these, you will have
fifty thousand doubts.
When will you learn all these?
How did you learn these?
Papa, smart-phone cannot be taught.
But it can be learned.
Don't try to hide anything from me.
I know everything.
Acting like a big shot
after directing one film?
Dad, can't you sit inside
instead of walking in the cold?
If you have something to say,
say it to your dad.
Here he is.
You may be tolerating all these.
I can't do that.
Instead of shouting,
tell me what's the matter.
Go ask your son!
-Kuttiyamma...
-Shut up!
Suspected this when
he did not come home.
So, this was the reason.
What's the matter, darling?
One tight slap and your teeth
will fall out. That's the matter.
Get up and go, man.
Dad, are you getting inside?
Why is your mom angry, Son?
Nothing. She came to talk to
her son for five minutes.
What did you tell him
to make him so angry?
I know why he is behaving differently.
What is your point?
Remember what we saw
in the news that day?
What?
Some people who work in films
are like that.
What do you mean?
Uff.
That means...
Do you get it now?
Who is this saint?
Saint it seems!
No clue about the things
happening in the world.
-Hey, son.
-Yeah.
Who is this?
You know the whole technique
so well, son!
First pass all your failed exams, you!
All set. Have handed it to
event management guys.
Where is the elevator?
Why elevator when we have this?
-Come.
-Hey, I will fall.
Was it here before?
Daddy, you carry on.
I am not used to this.
Come, get on it.
-Don't touch me!
-Come on, mom.
-Oops! I will fall down.
-Come with us.
She doesn't know it.
Why are they laughing so much?
That must be your old story...
You had entered the peon's store
and pooped when you were a child.
No, it may not be that.
Seeing the laughter,
chances are that the joke is the same.
Am I right, Kuttiyamma?
Right. He is your dad, after all.
Can't say.
Oops. We are close.
I will go back and come by stairs.
Don't panic. Come.
Oops! My god!
My knee!
Mother of God!
Oh my God...
You have grown thinner.
Don't you eat anything?
Are you scared of escalator, Kuttiyamma?
Not at all.
Long ago, I had a knee surgery.
I have severe pain after that.
Otherwise, she would have flown
an airplane!
Oh, what a joke.
Okay, Mom.
Let's go to the shop.
Look here.
Here, Surya!
Can you see me now?
I can see you, man.
Can you clearly hear what I am saying?
Yes, I can hear too.
We are here to buy clothes
for Joseph's birthday event.
Okay.
Is this a different phone?
Yes, this is new one.
Brand new!
Oppo F15.
Photos have great clarity.
Like a mirror.
Can I hang up if you are done
with your description?
Why are you so impatient?
I have to bathe.
Okay, I will call you later.
I am busy here.
Oliver, take a photo.
To send to Annammachi.
His happiness!
Like a kid with a toy.
To send to Annammachi.
-Is this really size 36?
-Yes, sir. It is.
Oliver...
Oops.
Got it?
Got it?
Oliver, I don't want a selfie.
I want a full-size picture
to send to Annammachi.
Full size? For Annammachi?
Aha...
-Varghese! What brings you here?
-Just some shopping.
-Brother.
-Yes, sir.
Can you take my photo?
-Can you see me?
-Yes, I can.
-In full?
-Yes.
-Stand still.
-Okay.
Don't move.
-Just press the circle to take a pic.
-I know that.
Excuse me, Joseph.
-Let's take the photo and then talk.
-Sorry.
-OK, Sir.
-Okay, then. See you.
Don't be deceived by the smile.
Kuttiyamma, how is this?
My child, there are too many
yellow T-shirts in your wardrobe.
-Isn't it a good yellow?
-Yeah, right.
-Is this okay?
-Turn this side.
Should I stand a bit further?
-Is this a photo shoot?
-I will stand a bit further.
It's not a photo shoot.
I want to send it to Annammachi.
Otherwise, she won't spare me.
Right guy for the job!
Let me see how you take it...
Click.
Click. Let me see.
Click. He is standing right
in front of the camera.
Why are you doing what
you don't know? Give it to me.
-Daddy, straighten it a bit.
-Where?
Don't grin too much.
You can reduce a bit.
Really?
Smile, it's okay.
Amazing.
Your "Daddy" is a rock-star.
He is so up-to-date.
You should hear him
talk about gadgets.
He knows things that even
we youngsters don't.
You should really read
his book.
When you read some chapters...
...you feel very inspired.
Open the gate.
You open it. I am tired.
Open it.
Open the gate, man.
What is this?
My body is aching.
Open the gate, man.
Go and open it.
I can't. One of you do it.
-I will do it.
-Bro, you open it.
If you are tired, stay in the car
for the night. Don't come out.
Hey, hold this.
Someone hold me.
I am tired.
-Kuttiyamma, I'm leaving.
-Okay then.
He is so fond of Joseph, right?
He must give Joseph
the love he deserves.
Let him give that.
Antony, I can't come to
Trivandrum tomorrow.
You are there anyway.
Go meet Vishal and narrate
the script really well.
We must start the project
next month itself.
Son, I made a mistake.
Today is Sunday.
Manure shop is closed.
Okay, so?
Drop me back home.
Expect me to come that far and go?
I will lose too much time, Papa.
Then I will come with you.
I will stay in the car,
I promise.
No way.
Wait here, Papa.
Ah Antony, you're here.
He's having lunch.
Santhosh, inform when he finishes lunch.
Someone is waiting.
-Just 5 minutes.
-Okay.
Hello, tell me.
Ah, OK.
Not this. Show me the other one.
-Okay, take this.
-That is good.
Yes, that's enough.
Hey...
Hey...
One minute.
Dude...
Dude, what's up?
Nothing. I am here to talk to
Vishal sir about a project.
Got it.
It got us here correctly.
Earlier, how many times we would
stop and ask people the route.
Right. By the way, did you see Vishal?
No, I didn't see him. He must be
inside the bus that is parked here.
Anyway, you have gone all that way.
Take a selfie with him.
I mean, a photo.
Yeah, I didn't think about that.
Okay.
Antony?
-Yes, Antony. Is he inside?
-Yeah.
Get in.
Hi
I am Antony's father.
Where is Antony?
I thought he must be in here.
He must be somewhere here.
Must be coming anytime now.
Try to convince him with
the story and start the project.
Okay.
A long gap is not good,
you know.
Agreed, your first film
was a super hit.
But after that, so many super hits and
new directors were born in this industry!
Make your next film before
the audience forgets you.
That's all I would say.
I'm unable to focus on
my writing like before.
Whatever I write...
...does not satisfy me.
Did you see this?
Did you see this? First look poster
of my next film. Isn't it beautiful?
Noticed the tone?
Can give Roger Deakins
a run for his money!
-What were you saying?
-No. Nothing.
-Wanna have some?
-Nope.
How many inches is the thing?
Your phone.
This... is not a phone.
This is called iPad or tablet.
WhatsApp?
Facebook.
How much would it cost
to start an account in that?
It doesn't cost anything.
Is it free?
Yes.
No documents needed?
Nope.
I have to return Baby's money.
If I don't...
It's more difficult to survive
than to become successful.
You idiot! Remove the M40
and put Par light.
-One minute. I'll come back.
-OK.
Smile a little wider.
-Okay?
-Is it good?
-Yes, very good.
-Okay.
Full name?
Oliver Twist.
-So, his name came from his dad?
-Yup.
I thought he was just showing off.
Oliver Twist.
-Who are you?
-Is Vishal sir inside?
Sir is in a discussion.
Please wait.
Okay.
Done.
A Facebook account for Mr. Oliver from me.
What is the secret behind this?
This name... Oliver Twist.
That's a story in itself.
My father was a typist.
In the forties and fifties...
He was a typist for those who translated
famous works from English to Malayalam
As he typed up these stories...
...he developed a liking towards
some characters.
And named us after them.
My brother's name is Peter Pan.
I had a sister. Mary Poppins.
She passed away.
What?
Papa on Facebook?
He made a complete mess?
Yeah!
Come in.
Take a seat.
Then?
The peon kept him in custody?
Of course!
He pooped and dirtied the whole store!
He was so tiny then.
He became a big film director only now.
He was screaming "Papa Papa"
from there.
Hey, Antony...
Your Papa is...
...is a very interesting guy.
You should learn from him
how to narrate a story.
So? What happened?
-Shouldn't we do the film?
-Can I narrate?
Go ahead.
-No, thanks. Please eat.
-Okay.
-Want some?
-Nope.
It's a story set in a city.
It has two characters.
A protagonist and an anti-protagonist.
Sir, I want you to play
the role of the villain.
Ready? Ready?
This fool doesn't know anything
other than 'ready, ready'.
Ready, sir.
I will keep it there.
By that time, kids will take
the glasses they want...
[Oliver snoring]
Sorry, sir.
What's happening actually is...
Antony... Antony...
Can we sit for this some other day?
The energy that I got when you
told me the one-liner...
That's missing now.
Just fizzled out.
I guess we diluted some of it.
Honestly, I felt bored.
That's because I rushed through it.
We can fix it in the making style.
Making is okay.
That part comes later.
For us, the content is key.
You work on it
with more focus.
We can surely discuss it again.
Work on it.
Hmm?
[Oliver snoring]
Your father...
You should wake him...
Shall we go?
Are you done?
Was it good?
Yes, yes.
What?
Don't look at me.
It's high.
You won't reduce deep fries
and pickles as I told you.
Are you feeling giddy now?
Oops!
What happened?
Didn't he tell the story?
No clue. I dozed off.
Vishal is a good man.
He treated me well.
Papa, do you find pleasure in
insulting me wherever you go?
Don't you have brains?
Switch it off.
-Switch off that thing.
-Okay.
What the hell
are you doing?
Switch it off, man.
Damn!
I'm telling you
to switch it off.
Make it fast.
What happened, son?
When I was away, Papa spoke to him
and made the whole thing a big joke.
This is a serious subject.
He has not understood a thing.
Didn't even hear it till the end.
And the producer... He is behind me
saying we have this idiot's dates.
Writing it is real tough.
I had taken a big advance
as the loan for this house.
Bank guys are forcing me
to close the loan quickly.
I don't look after this house, right?
Eh?
Papa is live?
Then? Didn't Vishal like the story?
I don't know.
Go ask him.
That moron has
a huge fan following too.
They will support him
even if his films flop.
Super star Vishal.
Loads of fans and dimwits.
No idea how he still survives.
His last five films were flops.
God...
What happened, man?
What is it, man?
Why did you come running?
Papa...
Stop scaring us. Tell us what's wrong?
Papa...
Papa... Papa's phone
was streaming it live...
On Facebook.
Great!
Dear, did I say anything
about Vishal sir?
MEME MOCKING ANTONY
Anyway you better stay off
the phone for a few days.
Random people ring up
and swear at me.
Half of them don't even
know what it's about.
Should've thought of it when you irk
people with your useless Facebook posts.
I had deleted it at once.
But by then...
At what cursed moment
I felt like doing that...
Can we think of anyone else?
Do you think it's the right
thing, Antony? I don't.
Wonder how Vishal
would have taken it.
Anyway, you go home.
Let me plan how to work this out.
Hey, where is that guy who
came for the script narration?
Ask him to come.
OK, then.
I have a script narration today.
Try to rework that script
as Vishal suggested.
Anyway this project will happen
only with his dates.
Now I am not going to
trouble you for updates.
You write it well peacefully.
-I didn't mean any of what I said...
-I also didn't mean anything...
I have that script reading now.
You better get going.
Take a seat.
-The film's title is "Seven Photographs".
-What?
-"Seven Photographs".
-OK. Read...
Where have you reached?
Somewhere.
Please listen to me.
Post the video I suggested.
People don't get angry or what?
That's what I felt then.
What to do about it?
I was in my house,
in my private space.
What's wrong with it?
-I can apologise to him in person.
-Anto, let me...
I can't post a public apology, Priya.
I am really sorry.
-My dear Anto, please listen to me.
-Hey, have a look.
"Director Antony swore at Superstar
Vishal. You'll be shocked to know why".
Mom, it's all fake news.
Don't show it around!
We know it is,
but not other people.
Mom, I'm on call.
Hello... Hey, don't worry about it.
Mom's not serious.
Yes, man!
In the director's Facebook page
where he comments about social issues
in an unbiased manner, fans of Vishal
have unleashed a volley of abuses.
This is the response to a live video
from the director's dad's FB account.
As the real face of
Antony Oliver Twist is revealed...
...the popular opinion is that
it's a twist too much to handle.
-Shall I serve dinner?
-I'm not hungry, Mom.
-What did the producer say?
-Didn't you watch it on TV?
So much for his excitement for
touch screen phones! Happy now?
Who the hell are you to comment on
Vishal Sir? You are just a newbie wannabe.
One hit, and they will turn arrogant.
You live off our hard earned money!
For sale -Healthy dragon kids
who breathe fire.
If you love your father, like this.
Hey.
-Don't be gloomy.
-Go away.
-Let's go for a ride.
-Oh.
Bro...
Come on.
You didn't brush your teeth, right?
-No.
-Keep quiet, then.
Hey.
Oh! You scared me.
Didn't you sleep?
It's so hot.
Didn't you turn on the AC?
Not that.
A churning inside me.
Can't sleep.
Son...
Are you angry with me?
For what?
It was an accident.
Leave it, Dad.
It's done. No use talking about it.
Will it affect your next film?
I don't know, Papa.
Shall we go and talk to Vishal?
That's easy to say. Only when you
go through it, you'll understand.
This is not being streamed live, right?
Can't handle it once more.
Hey.
Hey...
When did you come?
Why are you sleeping here?
Why didn't you call me?
I just dozed off.
Was on my morning walk.
Thought you will be asleep
and decided not to scare you.
That's good.
-Antony created a ruckus, no?
-No, he didn't say a thing.
Poor kid...
Remove Facebook from it.
I just need to attend calls.
Is it injured?
Why a band aid?
If you learn to use it properly,
there won't be any issue.
I don't want anything.
Remove that Facebook.
I've lost my sleep because of it.
Ah, it was you!
Why so early?
Wait. I'll bring tea.
Do you need tea?
I'm asking you. Are you deaf?
Do you need tea?
So, where were we?
-You two fighting?
-Never mind.
So, what I was saying.
This is a rare fortune.
Even if it is by trolling
your own son...
...it's no mean feat to get
350 friend requests a day.
Just take care while using it.
Spoken word and published Facebook post -
You can't retract either, Oliver.
You tell him. Papa is here.
Will give him the phone
It's our daughter.
She wants to talk to you.
-Hi, dear.
-Hi, Papa.
Papa, I need a favour.
You need to take dad somewhere.
Where, dear?
The usual problems, Papa.
Can't postpone this anymore.
Mom's fed up too. I've taken
the appointment of a psychologist.
You should somehow take dad to him.
I'll take him, dear.
Like hell you will!
To the looney bin...
-Why can't you go?
-I won't.
You take your father Payattuvila Ponnan.
He's the mad one.
No use telling him anything.
He was sitting next to me.
It's OK. I'll talk to him.
I'll take him there.
I will, for sure.
-OK then, dear. Call you later.
-OK, mom. Bye.
What's wrong with him to
consult a psychiatrist?
You know how he is.
He over ate and
has indigestion now.
Now he says he has stomach cancer.
Isn't this madness?
[Loud snores]
Hey!
WORRIED ABOUT SLEEP?
Will I also get an appointment
with the doctor?
What's wrong?
Sleeplessness.
He has taken me to a fraud...
Didn't you see the doctor?
-Yes.
-What did he say?
First, he gave some stupid advice.
Then he gave three pictures and
asked me to tick the one I like.
You could have ticked, no?
Langur, Mad dog and a Cobra-
which one should I like?
Where should I tick?
He doesn't know me.
Then he gave me a form
and asked me to fill all my details.
By that he will conclude that I'm mad.
So you aren't crazy?
That dumb doctor of yours is crazy,
old lady!
Hello... Doctor, can you hear me?
Don't scream, Rajesh.
I can hear you. Tell me.
It's breaking up.
Is there no signal there?
-What's breaking up?
-The voice.
I have good signal.
You talk.
Here also it's good.
It's urgent.
Can you move around a bit?
OK, I'll move.
Can you hear now?
-Now it's very clear.
-OK. Tell me.
The man who accompanied
the earlier patient wants to meet you.
Rajesh, tell me the rest later.
I'll give you a call.
Molly, but it's time for meditation.
It's once in a blue moon you get
a patient. Try to get hold of him somehow.
I'm going to send him in.
She's the doctor here now?
-What's your name?
-Oliver.
-Oliver.
-Oliver? Nice name.
What's up?
I can't sleep at night.
That's good.
I'll make you sleep.
-Taking any medicines?
-No.
Fill this and tick the pictures
you like in this sheet.
Doctor, I don't have any other issues.
I was passing by and just stepped in.
Initially everyone just steps in.
Mr. Oliver, understand one thing.
A psychologist is not for
finding out whether you are mad.
You have psychiatrists for that.
I'll explain.
Suppose a room in
your house is quite shabby.
If someone comes and cleans it up,
won't you be happy?
You'll find many missing things.
You can throw away some junk.
Won't the room be more beautiful?
That's my job.
Oh, cleaning?
I'll explain once again.
The mind of a person with anxiety and
depression will be like that shabby room.
-Got it now?
-Got it. I'll clean it and go to sleep.
No, no. You can't sleep like that.
You'll want to sleep.
But the mind will say:
"No. Think of all the stupidities
you've done so far."
Anxiety disorder.
We should find the cause
and get rid of it.
That's why I asked you to fill this.
Go ahead.
Let me change into
my treatment costume.
Are you done?
Give me.
Oh my god!
The condition is really serious.
Come on.
Hey, don't wake him up.
It's the effect of the treatment.
Let him sleep.
You come.
Where is the man who
was sleeping here before me?
The doctor took him for treatment.
Treatment?
The story changes track here
The new world forges ahead
Grey hairs and wrinkles vanish
The story changes track here
The new world forges ahead
Grey hairs and wrinkles vanish
Even in this dark
Slowly in the alley
My faltering legs step forward
If there is a spark of fire in the bosom
Even the scorching summer
Turns clear like drops of rain
What is this nonsense...
Oliver?
-How are you feeling now?
-I'm kind of sleepy now.
Very good!
This is Tai chi.
Sorry.
Do this for 4-5 days.
You'll get good sleep.
He probably won't wake up from it...
Hey, you come with me.
Bye, Sir.
I'll explain.
Oliver...
One minute...
You feel like an old man inside, right?
Come with me. He might make us sleep
right here. I can sleep at my house.
A child running ahead happily.
Suddenly sees a pit and stops.
If he crosses it,
he can go miles ahead.
But somehow he doesn't cross it.
Instead what if he
stops there, grows up...
...builds a house and
spends the rest of his life there?
That boy is Oliver Twist.
Don't you get any sleep?
How did you see that, Dad?
What other job do I have here?
Those days, knowing typewriting was
like computer engineering now.
My dad had an advanced thinking.
Perhaps it's that skill of his
that led me to open
a video library back then.
It was a risky business back then.
There was an unexpected legal dispute.
That was the pit you mentioned
the other day.
I had a helper back then
who was like my younger brother.
-I never thought he'll deceive me.
-What did he do?
Memories should be held close to heart.
They shouldn't be to blame anyone.
I was tempted into buying
by seeing others using it.
I don't think I can learn
how to use it in even five years.
There isn't anyone to
teach me properly also.
Who said there is no one?
We'll find a solution.
WHATSAPP
One tick means our message is gone.
Two ticks means they have
received our message.
If it turns blue, they've seen it.
We can know whether they saw it also?
What facilities!
"Hi Son"
"Hi Papa".
-What's that ball next to it?
-It's not a ball. It's a kiss.
For expressing the message sender's
feelings to the receiver...
...there are many such 'balls'.
So this is actually him giving me a kiss?
Hi Papa...
It's true. I can really understand
his feeling when he sent this.
This language
I know now for the first time
Time’s intoxication
In the palms of my hand
Falling
Let me rise alone
from the shattering fall
These days
I experience the magic
You have Google Pay?
-Isn't that my cycle?
-Yeah, now it's his.
-Why did you give it to him?
-You aren't using it. I sold it on OLX.
It's paid.
How long have I been calling you?
If you want something to eat,
come down now and eat.
I have other things to do.
Mom's calling you for dinner.
Come down fast.
Hi dear, this is Papa.
How are you?
Had your food?
How's Joseph?
Hi son, do you have
any dirty laundry?
Bring it fast.
Mom is free now.
Blue skies lie ahead
Soar high like a kite
Till the shore longed for
You are completely
in their trap now, aren't you?
-Sir is not as you imagine.
-Hmm. "Sir"!
You know the paper
I filled and ticked?
From that he figured out
most of my problems.
Must be witchcraft.
The lady there looks like a witch.
They were short of a goblin.
You have completed the set.
Then that doc...
Doctor...
I'll make a move...
One minute...
This watch was a gift, right?
Yes, from my elder daughter.
-Rado. Nice watch.
-Thank you.
Can you tell me
its model number?
It's just below the Rado logo.
It isn't there.
No. But didn't you believe
for a moment it's there?
Does the dial have
Roman letters or numbers?
Say without looking.
Ro... No, numbers!
Right?
-Sure?
-Yes, sure.
It's neither.
They are lines.
OK.
Now you have looked
at the watch at least thrice.
Can you tell me what's the time?
-Around...
-I mean the exact time.
I don't know, Sir...
You realise that there are so many things
you don't notice in this watch you wear.
Because you only see
what you want to see.
But a psychologist can help you
find out many things that you miss.
It's not witchcraft.
Got it?
The way upstairs is outside?
Yes, if we get some good tenants...
The sapodilla is quite ripe.
Have it today.
-What's all this?
-Look at this. All homegrown.
Papa takes care of them.
OK.
There comes Papa.
How many times did I call you?
Why didn't you pick up the call?
When did you come?
Are you about to leave?
We came to remind you
about Saturday's event.
We will come even without a reminder.
This is Suryan, my friend
and brother.
-This is Antony's dad.
-So, you are...?
I mean, Priya's dad.
Joseph.
-Nice meeting you.
-Did they have anything?
I insisted. But they need to go
to the airport to pick his brother.
You should have had lunch.
We need to pick up
Justin and wife. It's too late.
In that case, all of you come
after a couple of days.
Let's all have lunch here.
Let me see...
No, you must come.
OK. We'll come.
OK, then.
You visit Dr. Franklin's clinic, right?
I go there.
Do you know him?
I had seen Oliver with him.
That's why I asked.
What's wrong with you
to consult a doctor?
This is not the normal doctor.
He is a mental doctor.
A psychologist, I mean.
To clean the mind,
just like we clean the rooms.
-We'll be off then.
-OK then.
-Where's your car?
-Parked on the road.
-See you later.
-Antony...
One second.
-Kuttiyamma, I'm off too.
-Have tea.
No, stomach upset.
Bye then.
-Don't always sit gloomily at home.
-Nothing like that.
-Go out and meet your friends.
-Please give way.
Brakes are loose.
Bye, son.
And, try out what I suggested.
-All OK?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. You go ahead.
OK.
Where do you want to go, dad?
-Want to sit there?
-There...
Aren't you done ridiculing me?
Why do you consult
a psychologist?
-What will Daddy think?
-What to think?
Go away, Papa.
What did I do, man?
Are you mad to
consult a psychologist?
It's not the mad who
consult a psychologist.
All of you understand that first.
I'll explain it to you
in a simple manner.
Dear, the watch you are wearing
was a gift, right?
Yes. Why?
-What's the model?
-GW9400.
It's dial has Roman letters or numbers?
How will a digital watch have a dial?
Well...
-Didn't you look at it three times now?
-Just once.
-Then, what's the time now?
-4:32 PM.
Did I ask you, dad?
Why are you getting angry?
Hey, tell him the time.
-4:30.
-4:30!
No use talking to you people.
Everything is kept in the way.
What I was going through on the day
I said that is beyond words.
No, no. Antony,
don't use that sentence.
We shouldn't give our excuses
while apologizing.
They should feel that we have realised
our mistake and will never repeat it.
-Bro...
-How are you gonna send it?
On WhatsApp...
No, no, no. Don't type it.
Take a white paper and
write it in neat handwriting.
They should think of it as
a forgiveness promissory note.
You got it?
Tell Joseph to come here
someday soon.
Can't leave the kids like this.
Need to decide something soon.
Only when he gets a companion this
anger and anxiety will be calmed.
Where will I keep all of these?
There is no space.
Move aside.
Isn't all this space enough?
-Give me.
-Shall we buy a fridge?
And we will put a bed inside it
and sleep there...
You put everything inside this.
I'll arrange it.
Are you free, Papa?
Yes. What's it, son?
Can you write me a letter
in your handwriting?
My Lord! This man...
Will it be good if I write it?
Your handwriting is awesome.
OK, tell me the matter.
"Dear Sir"
Daddy, I've just sent it.
He might not have seen it.
Let's see how he responds.
Let Vishal sir reply.
No need of it anymore.
See this...
Nice one!
From where?
My uncle gave it to me.
Can you give it to me?
Go away.
Hey...
Hey, Surya...
Stop!
Give it to me.
Surya, I will throw
a stone at you, okay?
Stop, man!
Hey...
Stop! I can't run anymore, man!
Give it to me.
Can you swim across this river?
-Can you?
-Yes.
In this cold?
Wanna see?
Yeah, I will give this to you
if you cross this.
Are you free for five minutes?
Tell me, Papa.
I've been thinking of telling you
something for a while.
Long back,
almost 48 years ago...
An extraordinary event in my life.
Not sure if you remember.
Mom's brother was a priest.
He had a Landmaster car.
To get rides in it, I'd go to him
whenever possible.
At Ponmudi...
When he goes to the town, I'd be
given responsibility of the church.
One day a young lady came
in search of the priest, crying.
She had a child on her shoulder.
I hadn't seen her before that.
Back then, only the priest
had a car there.
She must have come
looking for that.
Hearing that he wasn't there,
she walked back dismayed.
Seeing her running here and
going back slowly, I got suspicious.
I went in search of her.
Running after her, I asked,
"Why are you crying?"
She brushed me aside
and continued walking.
I again went after her, caught hold
of her hand and asked:
"Why are you crying?"
That mother replied in tears,
"He said my kid will die".
I asked,
"Who said?"
Some village physician,
it seems.
That the kid will die unless he is
taken to the Medical College urgently.
-What was wrong with the child?
-I didn't ask that.
She was not in a
state of mind to say that also.
I understood the condition was serious.
Unable to watch her crying, I said:
"You want to reach
the Medical College? Let's go".
What did you say, dear?
You said the child can be saved if you
reach the Medical College soon. Let's go.
You should have seen the happiness
on her face when I told her this.
But I had no idea where the Medical
College was, neither had I gone there.
My only friend at that place was Suryan.
Medical College? How will we take her?
Do you know the way?
-Medical College is quite far away.
-The next bus is only tomorrow.
You can get there quickly
if you go by car.
-Who has a car here?
-It's the child's fate...
Hey, that Mukkili Sahib
has a car, right?
It will take us one-and-a-half hours
to reach his house.
Will he survive till then?
Oliver, where are you taking them?
Reservoir is narrower at the place
where we went that day.
Sahib's house is just five minutes
away from there.
Crazy or what?
What's it?
What?
That entire stretch
is through the forest.
There may be elephants
on the way.
Moreover, how will we cross
the river in this cold?
Hey, I have an idea.
-I am scared, man.
-Don't be.
-Sure it won't sink?
-Don't you know the law of buoyancy?
-It won't sink.
-I don't think this will work.
We will know only if we try.
How will four of us fit in this?
-Only they will get inside.
-So we just have to help them get in?
What?
No way. We have to support this
and swim.
Swim across?
-What were you saying before?
-So what?
-What's this, man?
-You hold it properly.
So cold!
What is this,
my dear?
Don't worry.
Be brave and climb in.
Once across, Mukkili Sahib's house
is just five minutes away.
We can reach the hospital
quickly in his car.
-Did she get in?
-At first, she hesitated.
Then I told her something.
She climbed into that vessel at once.
-What did you say?
-I said...
It's been so many years.
I forgot it.
-Is this a true story?
-You don't believe it. Do you?
That's the problem with this story.
I saw an elephant
rising out of the water.
Not one, there was an
entire herd bathing.
We became transfixed
for a moment.
We had to do something.
Ready for anything to happen...
...I looked the elephant in the eye
and walked straight ahead.
You won't believe it. The elephants moved
to both sides as we walked forward.
That's fabulous!
We got out of the forest in
five minutes without a scratch.
Amazing, Dad.
-It happened for real, I swear.
-Well, did I say something?
But your face looks like...
-...you don't believe me.
-Don't look at my face then.
If you don't believe this...
...you will never believe
what I'm going to say next.
We reached Sahib's house and
continued the journey in his car.
-What's so unbelievable in this?
-I haven't told that yet. I'm going to.
On the way, we stopped
seeing a crowd on the road.
The Sahib switched off the vehicle
and got out to check.
-What was the issue?
-Nothing then.
I also got out.
Behind me, Suryan too.
Oh, no! The car!
God!
We ran as fast as we could.
Behind was a deep valley.
It will break into pieces.
Luckily the vehicle hit a stone
and slowed down.
I somehow managed to get in
and braked the car to a stop.
You don't believe me?
-Did you reach the Medical College?
-Of course.
We reached the Medical College, dropped
them and came back home in a few hours.
-What happened to that child?
-He must have survived.
The physician had told he'll be fine
if they reach the Medical College, right?
OK. Are you done with
the extraordinary tale?
What do you think?
-It's fine.
-No, overall what did you feel?
Overall I found it quite
logical and inspiring.
Go away, Papa...
Vishal...
I can guess why he
didn't like the story.
You would have undermined
my role in your narration.
Many of my brave deeds
must have seemed like jokes to him.
Not just you,
I'm also a joke now.
Anyway, he didn't say
he didn't like it.
No man, he didn't like it.
I could read it on his face.
It's late.
I'm off...
-Shall I walk you home?
-Why?
Here, wear this.
No, I'll look like
a monkey with this.
Come on, man.
Hey, tell me.
Are you out?
Look... It's Kichu's birthday today.
We're having a party. Tell me...
Vishal's reply came.
Priya...
What are you doing here?
Everyone's waiting. Go there!
Hello, director bro!
You don't care for us nowadays.
Not seeing you live these days.
Post a live. It'll be fun!
Disconnected?
Bitch!
Pop this, okay?
Your director disconnected the call.
-Why?
-Maybe he's scared.
Is this a gift?
Play the song.
Lemme cut the cake.
Happy birthday to you...
Sorry! Sorry!
Cut it.
-Come on, cut it.
-Shall I? Are you sure?
I have told you many times not to
hang around that scoundrel Kichu.
You go around celebrating the birthdays
of every random person.
Tell that loser scumbag Kichu that
I'll break his head if I ever see him.
That will be my next live.
That idiot wants to watch my next video.
Ask him to come.
I'll show it to that bowl-head!
I told you that already.
Do what you want.
Why are you telling me?
Get off the call.
I told you that already.
I'm not interested, Priya.
Do your own shit.
Don't call me.
Don't ask me!
Get off the call!
Oh my God!
-How long has it been. Come here!
-I'll come, mommy...
Give it to me, please...
Here's some sapodilla.
Earlier when I used to come, she would
hang around me saying "uncle".
-This is her own find, right?
-Where is this from?
Kuttiyamma gave it when
we went to Antony's house...
If he's already fighting like this,
what will it be after the wedding?
It isn't so bad, Justin.
He takes good care of his parents.
Has the same love for us too.
He will show that now.
Anyway I don't find
this relationship very positive.
-What are you saying?
-What's wrong in it?
How is the family?
Bro...
One piece.
Brother...
Let's see, man.
Tomorrow we're visiting them.
You are her uncle.
You too see.
Seems the kids have some issue.
Did he tell you anything?
Should I call her and ask?
They will sort out
the issue between them.
Why do you want to intervene?
To worsen it?
I haven't called, right?
Was just asking you...
Call or not, I'm not
gonna intervene.
Did anyone ask you to?
Ask or not, I'm not
gonna intervene.
God... My leg!
Damn films, just to scare people...
Kuttiyamma...
Kuttiyamma...
Can you get me some water?
Is everyone asleep?
Son...
-Yes, Papa?
-Any issue with Priya?
You mind your own business, Papa!
Kuttiyamma...
Papa...
"Hail Mary, Full of Grace,
The Lord is with thee..."
[Continues chanting]
"Pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen."
-What's it?
-It was you, Papa...
I thought it was that old hag
from "The Nun".
-Come here.
-What?
Is there any issue between
Priya and Antony?
-Tell me before you look at it.
-Wait! That's what I'm looking at.
They are fighting!
You can find that out
through this?
To know whether they are fighting,
just check Priya's Instagram stories.
Look at this...
"I'm only good at hiding my feelings"
"Happy birthday, sweetie"
"My happiest moments ever"
Look, all these are today's updates.
There are many similar ones.
Seeing this, don't we feel
she's very happy? But it isn't so.
She just wants to irritate him.
This is known as
"Emotional Attyachar".
Priya dear, this is Papa.
-Yes, Papa.
-What happened, daughter?
-Nothing.
-Don't cry, dear.
Why are you crying?
Don't cry...
OK then. I'll call you later.
Don't cry.
It was Suryan.
He has a stomach upset.
Do you call him "daughter" now?
I told you they have some issue.
I called her. She's crying badly.
Charles said they are
in some "Emotional Achar".
What sort of achar is it?
No idea. You go find.
Oliver, do you know
what's Antony's real issue?
-There is a robber with him.
-Robber?
Don't worry. He's now with
almost everyone in this world now.
Here... This is him.
It's not wealth that he steals.
It's something no wealth can buy -
Time.
Suppose, we are about to start a job.
We hear a notification sound...
...and think we'll just
check it for a second.
We never realise this one second is
growing into minutes, hours and days.
For a creative person like Antony...
on seeing others' achievements, an
unwanted comparison and ego will develop.
An unnecessary fear that "Only I am
not doing anything" sprouts in his mind.
If he doesn't have the phone
with him,
it'll be like a smoking addict
being deprived of cigarettes.
But a smoker knows that cigarette smoking
is injurious to health.
He does it with that knowledge.
But a smart-phone addict doesn't realise
that this will affect his mental health...
...and affect the focus on his work.
They'll start getting angry
at people near them.
Slowly it'll start affecting
their family and relationships.
Isn't there a way to cure phone addiction?
The only way is to realise
that it's an addiction.
Then like any addiction,
reduce the usage.
And try being at home.
Keep the robber at a distance.
Make every moment of life beautiful.
You can find your true home.
Look at what this house
used to look like!
It started with the boys demanding
a room for themselves upstairs.
Antony had just finished
architecture studies.
Trying out all his artistic skills,
the house ended up like this.
What a change!
Antony.
His usual pose for the camera is that.
Holding the phone...
It still continues.
Nowadays, who has time to
preserve photos in print?
Everything is there in the phone, right?
It'll stay in the phone,
but not in the mind.
It's really nice, right? Seeing
what I did, the neighbours started doing.
But what's the use?
None of them love the plants.
When we care, nurture and love them,
they flower and bear fruits.
Seeing it, I get a pleasure
similar to giving birth.
Isn't it so?
Really nice, right? Let's also
build a room like this.
Hold her.
Did you find even
one photo of me in it?
I didn't notice.
This has only photos of
the dad and sons, none of me.
You were busy running around.
Where was the time for clicking photos?
This house now runs thanks to
that running around.
Some sprinter you're...
With a nurse at home, we didn't have to
hire a home nurse for my dad.
She'll take care of everything.
Poor thing...
It's not entirely me,
Papa helps out once in a while.
There were no birthday parties today?
Antony...
Phone.
From the bank?
Yes, the manager calls often
to canvas for health insurance.
Pass me the salad.
Don't fill yourself with this.
There's fried rice too.
-Aunty's cooking is fabulous!
-Thank you.
-Please share this recipe with me.
-Sure.
I'm planning to start a cooking channel.
She can't even make tea well.
It's OK, dear. Here's one.
He can't even plant spinach.
Still, he's a big YouTuber.
-Oh, Charles has a YouTube channel?
-I haven't watched.
Neither have we.
Started earning revenue?
Of course, tons of it.
His account can't hold
all the millions.
Isn't it?
[mumbling]
Cutlet for you?
Keep it aside at least
when you are eating.
He's on it all the time.
Hello...
Yes?
I'll call you.
Come immediately.
-OK?
-Can you call back?
Hey, come here.
There he is.
One second.
I'll deal with these managers.
Don't let anyone come there.
Especially that nasty baldy!
Sorry, it's my plate. I won't let
anyone take it home. Give it.
Who's that?
Priya, get up and
wash your hands.
Hi...
Woke up, grandpa?
Don't be afraid! We won't
make an author of you.
-He doesn't say anything else?
-After the accident, he sleeps less...
...sorry speaks very less. Half of it
is in English without head and tail.
One second. Tell me.
-Please keep it there.
-She is not listening to me.
I get you. But the previous manager
approved the loan based on your salary.
Resigning from your job and joining films
is fraud in the eyes of the bank.
Mommy, Can we have a fish like this?
We'll buy today itself.
Anything else?
She's like this. She doesn't
even buy a puppy.
All moms are the same.
-I've been asking for ages.
-You'll buy pets and go away.
We'll have to take care
of its droppings.
Have some more ice cream.
-Come on, baby...
-There he goes with the baby.
Hey, give the baby some ice cream.
We'll have it later.
Oh, here's your dad.
Oh dear, what happened?
Why are you crying?
Shall I pick you up?
She's cranky.
Hey, where is Antony?
Over there, talking to someone.
-Susan...
-Yeah?
The problem is the EMI dues.
I have a lot of pressure
from the head office.
If you pay at least
the pending interest...
...I'll be able to support you.
-Hey, why are you here?
-Papa, he's the new bank manager.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Please come in.
-No, we're in a hurry.
Please have tea.
No, it's about to rain. Let's leave.
-Who's that?
-Well... Come here.
There's something...
Come fast.
-They're calling you, Papa.
-You take care of them.
OK. Bye.
Start...
So all of you please go to Charlz...
-What was the name?
-Techy!
So all of you please go
to Charlz Techy channel...
-...and like, share, subscribe.
-The gesture you showed is of dislike.
People will do that.
Say once more.
I'm not in the mood.
Please understand.
OK, then.
Also... Pick up the calls.
We get anxious when you don't.
OK?
Must be health insurance...
He left?
I got scared.
Whether he'll create a ruckus
about the missed EMIs.
We'll start then.
Shall we?
Now? Wait for the rain to stop.
It's thundering.
That's OK.
-Should we wait for a bit?
-Then let the rain let up.
Wonder when the power will be back.
He had promised to repair
the inverter himself,
but it never happened.
-Did the water fall on her?
-She got scared of the thunder.
-The wind has brought the rain in.
-Come on, sweetie.
Dear, move away from the window.
Charles...
Come down.
Hey, how many times have I told you
not to sit near the window with the phone?
What's your problem, Papa?
Don't you hear the thunder? Why can't you
leave it aside for five minutes?
So what? I haven't
connected it anywhere.
Won't it come through the radiation
from the lightning?
What radiation?
Won't it come through the air?
It has internet, right?
Don't make a laughing stock
of yourself, Papa.
It's an addiction, right?
It's like smoking.
He can't keep it away
even for five minutes.
Vishal has announced
his new movie.
-Isn't this Antony's producer?
-Let me have a look.
It's all due to this
phone addiction.
Otherwise he could have finished
the script and made the film.
He fights with Priya daily.
Have you noticed them talking
at least once today?
-This is the reason.
-Can you just stop it?
You're driving me crazy.
I am wondering why I decided
to come to this cursed home.
You all are the reason for this.
Remember it's your stupidity
I'm paying for right now.
Antony, please...
What happened?
Everyone's so gloomy...
Kuttiyamma would have said
something stupid, right?
Hey guys...
Yes, we are both stupid.
We brought you up like this.
That's our biggest stupidity.
What did I do to get scolded?
Why, can't I scold you?
Can't I?
That man there is your father.
Keep that in mind.
Who are you two?
Kings come down from heaven?
You...
Shall we?
-The rain hasn't let up.
-Don't think it will...
Call Susan.
OK, then...
Why did they
Disappear
In the moonlit night
Why in a corner
Of the eye did
They stand wilted
By the side of the waiting flower
My tearful dreams
Does the sky sob after the rains
When nobody watches
Why did they
Disappear
In the moonlit night
Oh if only you were within reach
The distances have become flaming lamps
Like waves of twinkling tears
Have you faded away
Oh if only you were within reach
The distances have become flaming lamps
Unseen
Did you seek the edges of these fields?
As dark falls
Won’t you rest in this beautiful nest?
Beside my heart
As the story changes
Come along, alone
There are thousands of
inspiring stories out there.
Among those, what's the
significance of my autobiography?
My life story was not unique.
My voice was not special.
I told this to Annammachi once.
It was she who gave me the courage.
"There's no one else like you.
If you don't express yourself..."
"...if you don't explore who you are, then
the essence of you will be lost forever."
And that was my inspiration.
Not just the urge to write...
...this beautiful cover you see here...
...is also painted by my dear mom.
Now you talk, Mommy.
I haven't painted in a long time.
This was because he persisted.
Whenever I take the brush in hand,
a face comes to my mind.
The face of God.
There was a day
when God came to earth for me.
Oh, my God! Honey...
Realising I can't even take him
to the hospital...
...I decided to end my life.
As I walked back,
a hand stopped me, as if sent by God.
Why are you crying?
He said to my tired self,
"Don't cry..."
"Medical college? We'll go there."
Those words brought me back to life.
Scared by his reckless actions
to get us to the hospital...
...I began to walk back.
Then he told me something.
"You don't need as much courage
to get on to this,
as you need to watch your son die."
After I admitted Joseph, I couldn't find
that kid and the others who came.
He came to rescue from somewhere
like God, and disappeared.
I searched a lot, but
couldn't find that boy.
How long can I search for
someone anonymous?
I often think...
Why did he risk his own life
to help total strangers like us?
When I paint something for his
autobiography, what else will I show?
There were a lot of hindrances
to go to the hospital.
No vehicle. The villagers
said it's impossible.
When man, beast and nature forbade,
he didn't abandon us.
The reason for my family
existing today is that good soul.
Son...
You were right.
Lightning won't strike
through the mobile.
I checked on the internet.
Though I'm writing from the heart,
my handwriting is very bad.
I was very conscious about
people seeing the bad in me.
Because I feared that if people
come across them they will ridicule...
...rebuke or swear at me.
So, once I became a filmmaker...
...I was determined to show
only my good side in public.
My attention shifted from my job
to what others perceive about me.
That was the Antony Oliver Twist
you knew.
A few days back, all of you would
have seen a leaked video of mine.
As I feared, many ridiculed,
rebuked and swore at me.
The person you saw in
that video is the real me.
I blurted out something
in my sudden anger.
Refusing to own my mistake,
getting angry, being egoistic...
...depressed, quarrelling with elders -
I'm an ordinary man who does all these.
I'm not a perfect person.
But I do all this at a place where
I believe I have the freedom to.
At my home.
For the people there
won't get angry...
...make fun of me or curse me
if I make a mistake.
Instead they will correct that wrong.
I'm always imperfect at my home.
Why is he not talking?
Is he cross with someone?
He generally doesn't talk.
People like us
don't go out at night.
Lines from Oliver Twist.
Is that your favourite novel?
Why did you come alone?
Surprise...
Who said I'm alone?
My entire family is there.
To meet my God
I've searched for all this time.
Do you feel angry when you see this?
That means you are a smart-phone addict.
You get angry because you've no patience.
Look at him, Mickey.
His attendance... sorry guys,
attention span is just 8 seconds.
The attention span of a smart-phone
addict will be less than his -7 seconds.
He's writing, guys.
I've heard the script, guys.
It's so fresh.
We'll go away and
not disturb him.
Let him cook the script.
Oh guys, I can't believe this.
Vishal! Vishal! Vishal! Hoo!
-So, finally...
-Yes.
We're going to do it.
All the very best!
Thank you, Sir.
-Who's filming without permission?
-It's my brother, Sir.
Come here.
-What's your name?
-Charles.
Charles Oliver Twist...
Dear viewers, see this.
We are watching oldies jumping around
in the court instead of sleeping at home.
I'm clueless about what's happening
here but it looks really good.
Hey you!
Come here.
One minute, guys...
-Hey!
-Here I come.
What an ugly red garb...
Doctor bro, what an addiction this is.
Keep that phone aside.
Go do Tai Chi!
Grandpa bro has been
typing something for a while.
Let's find out what it is.
No ink?
Grandpa bro,
this doesn't have ink!
Oh my God!
Guys...
Dad has nicely tricked grandpa by
giving him a typewriter without ink...
