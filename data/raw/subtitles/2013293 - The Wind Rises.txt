The Wind Rises.
The wind is rising!
We must try to live.
Jiro, here it is.
Would it be all
right I borrow it?
- It's not in Japanese.
- That's okay, I have a dictionary.
- All right then, give it a try.
- Thank you.
- Knock it off.
- Stay out of it, Jiro!
Go home. Now!
Jiro... Jiro... Jiro...
He's half your size, Katayama.
Ahh... you look quite the hero.
No, I just slipped and fell.
- Fighting is never justified.
- Yes, Mother.
All right now, you can
go have your snack.
Thanks!
Jiro, you're home!
- Welcome home.
- Oh, Jiro...
now we can pick
some bamboo grass!
Jiro!
Wait! Where are you going?
You promised to pick
bamboo grass today.
I've got homework.
What kind of homework is that?
It's an English magazine.
Oh, look at his stupid mustache.
He's a very famous Italian
aircraft designer.
His name is Caproni. Wow,
it says he's a count.
What happened? Your
face is scratched.
Leave it alone, Kayo.
You should put iodine on it.
- I'll do it for you.
- Would you cut it out!
What are you doing up here?
You're not supposed
to be up here.
Where are your glasses?
I heard you can fix your eyesight by
focusing very intently on the stars.
Mom will be mad if
you're not in your bed.
A shooting star!
Ooh. There's another one.
Ahh... they're pretty.
Oh! Look at that one.
Wow.
There are so many of them.
[Speaking Italian]
I'm a Japanese boy.
[Replies in Italian]
I'm dreaming.
I think this is my dream.
[Replies in Italian]
This is my dream, you know.
I think it's mine too.
Your dream?
Listen, Japanese boy. So you
think we are sharing this dream?
I hope so.
You are Count Caproni, aren't you?
I've been reading all about you.
Interesting. Yes, this is a
dream. This world's a dream.
Welcome to my kingdom.
I'm honored.
Look at them.
They will bomb an enemy city.
Most of them will never return.
Well, it will all be over soon.
Come on up, Japanese boy.
This is my true dream.
When the war is over,
I will build this.
What do you think?
Magnificent, isn't she?
Let's take off.
Instead of bombs, she'll
carry passengers!
I find dreams are a good way...
to see my designs.
I can go anywhere!
Come on, walk along the
spar, Japanese boy.
Look at that.
Ooh...
- She is beautiful, yes?
- Yes, incredible.
She will carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic. Both ways.
Mr. Caproni? May I ask
you a question?
I know I can't be a pilot,
because of my eyesight.
If I'm not a pilot, can
I still design airplanes?
Japanese boy. I've been
around planes all my life.
Do you know how many I've
flown? None! Not a one!
Many can fly airplanes,
but I design them!
I create airplanes!
And so can you!
- An aeronautical engineer!
- Yes!
But remember this, Japanese boy.
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Engineers turn
dreams into reality.
Yes!
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.
Jiro, you were talking
in your sleep.
You were smiling.
You must have been having the
most wonderful dream, Jiro.
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.
Oh... That does sound
like a good dream.
He told me that airplanes
are beautiful dreams.
So I'm going to make
beautiful airplanes.
Excuse me, miss,
please take my seat.
Pardon me, sir.
I insist.
(The wind feels wonderful.)
Miss, you'll lose your hat.
I got it.
- Miss!
- Hold on!
- Are you all right?
- Safe!
Nice catch.
You speak French?
"Le vent Se lève."
It's a French poem.
"IL faut tenter De vivre."
"Le vent Se lève. IL
faut tenter De vivre."
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."
Earthquake.
Get away! The
boiler's gonna blow!
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.
Here, let me see.
Be brave, Kinu.
It's broken. She won't
be able to walk.
Miss, the boiler. Please
save yourself. Go!
That's nonsense.
Nothing's going to explode.
We need to brace her leg.
This will hurt a little.
Just relax.
She can't walk on this.
Where do you live?
- In Ueno.
- Don't worry. I'll get you there.
- Fire.
- Let's go.
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.
- I'm sorry.
- Hang on, Kinu.
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
Better hurry.
Here, my mother
made me this shirt.
You must be thirsty.
Don't worry, it's clean.
The well is almost
dry. And for you?
Please.
The fire hasn't
reached Ueno. And...
I'm heading for the university.
So, I can take you there.
And I'll bring someone
from my house.
Then we should get going, now.
- Kinu, look after my suitcase?
- Okay.
We'll bring someone to help
get you home. I promise.
- Okay.
- Stay strong.
I will.
- Thank you very much for helping us.
- Take care of her.
But wait, at least
tell us your name.
What a great guy.
Who was he, Kinu?
Well, if it isn't Jiro! You
picked a lovely day to come back.
How bad is it, Honjo?
Bad enough. The whole
east side is burning.
We grabbed everything we could
carry out of the library.
Got a smoke?
A flying door. You don't
see that every day.
They'll never stop the fire now.
Tokyo's finished.
It's as beautiful as
it was in the dream.
I can't believe he
really built it.
Cut! Cut, cut, cut, cut...
Cut!
The damn wind's picking
up. We need to hurry!
What do you think, Japanese
boy? Is the wind still rising?
Yes! It's a gale!
Well then, you must live.
"Le vent Se lève."
"II faut tenter De vivre."
- Jiro, let's eat.
- Uh-huh.
Look, even the new buildings
are old-fashioned.
The streets are a little wider.
So? And the airplanes
are still old.
Welcome!
Oh look, mackerel again.
Yeah... It's always good.
Always.
Always the same lunch.
Always the same mackerel.
- Kimi, may I have an egg?
- Coming up.
Meanwhile, other countries
are building metal planes.
We are always ten years behind.
And you're so stuck on mackerel!
What is it?
Beautiful, isn't it?
Look at that wonderful curve.
Only you would get a
thrill from fish bones.
Come on, finish up.
Bring your coffee.
What on earth is Jiro
working so hard on?
Fish bones.
Is Mr. Horikoshi
back from lunch?
Jiro!
Honjo, listen to this.
The NACA has a standard
wing cross-section,
just like the curve
of this fish bone.
Maybe the Americans
eat mackerel too.
Jiro, you've got a visitor.
- Yes?
- A young lady came by and brought
this package for
you, Mr. Horikoshi.
You were out, so she
left it with me.
I see. Thank you, very much.
Aw, is that a present from
your girlfriend, Jiro?
Can it, freshman. And
give me a smoke.
- Jiro!
- Let him go.
- Oh, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Yes, ma'am.
You have a guest waiting
for you upstairs.
It's a young lady.
Huh? Young lady?
- Hello?
- Finally! Where were you?!
Kayo! I'm sorry.
- Completely forgot.
- I'm not surprised!
- Where's Mother?
- At Uncle's.
- Is she staying there?
- Just for a night.
Kayo, you've gotten so tall.
And very pretty, too.
You are so insensitive.
I'm still mad at you,
'cause you never come home.
Oh, the sun's already
down. I'm gonna be late.
I'll tell them it's my
fault. Don't worry.
We'll take the penny steamer.
I think she must
really like you.
I don't know, it's
been over two years.
Didn't you ever try
to see her again?
I did. I went back after
the fires were out.
Her house had burned down.
That's terrible.
Here, let's catch this one.
Are you cold, Kayo?
I'm fine. I didn't think Tokyo
would recover so quickly.
Ah, Jiro, maybe I can
stay here with you?
Father won't let me
live here by myself.
Well, I might be in Nagoya
by the time you come.
- With an airplane company?
- I hope so.
Men have it so good.
Why can't I live in Tokyo
and go to medical school?
Medical school? You should. I think
you'd make a great doctor.
I think so too.
When I'm home for New Years,
I'll talk to Father about it.
Oh... Thank you!
Hey! Jiro!
- Heavy?
- Yep.
- Glad you made it.
- Me too.
- We're just getting started.
- We certainly are.
Well, they were probably heading
for the city to look for work.
There were dozens of them.
And there will be hundreds more.
Looks like we lost another bank.
This time it's Kamihatci.
- It's awful.
- And so sad.
There were rumors.
The economy's in the tank.
And I hate to break it to you,
Jiro, but so is our new employer.
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.
Do you know the
pressure we're under?
We needed you here
over a month ago!
But sir, I was told I could
start anytime in April.
Then you should've
been here in March!
Yes, sir.
I've got a very important
assignment for you.
Yes, sir.
It's the design for the
wing strut fitting.
- And by the way, it's already late!
- Yes, sir.
I need the plans in the
shop as soon as possible!
- Do what you have to do!
- Yes, sir.
Here!
Let's get your sundry
specifications. Follow me!
This will be your desk.
It's imported, nobody likes it.
- Maybe you will.
- Yes, sir.
- Work goes here, hat goes there.
- Yes, sir.
Listen up! This is
the new engineer...
on the Falcon Project!
It's that genius we've
been hearing all about.
- Name, genius?
- Jiro Horikoshi.
I am very happy to be here.
- Get to work.
- Yes, sir.
And the rest of you...
Get back to work!
Jiro?
Jiro.
Let's eat.
Ah!
- Let's go see the assembly floor.
- Could we maybe have lunch first?
Maybe Kurokawa simply hates you.
Why else would he have you design
that strut on your first day?
Two, please.
Excuse me.
Could we ask a slight favor?
Wow, it's really coming along.
Thank you, again, for making
time for us on your break.
No problem at all.
You young engineers should
visit here more often.
Honjo, look, the strut has
already been installed.
I knew it. Kurokawa's
obviously just hazing you.
Unless... his fitting
is better than yours.
Mr. Kurokawa's always
tough on new employees.
Honjo, come up here
and take a look.
Something's not right.
- What do you think?
- It looks solid to me.
No, this isn't good. It's got
the same problem as my design.
Then it must be bad.
Foreman, lunch is over.
What's going on?
Quiet. They're working
I love it! Airplanes
are fascinating!
Yeah, fascinating,
but we're late.
Young man.
This is our boss, Mr. Hattori.
Is this his first assignment?
The strut fitting for the
Falcon Project, sir.
Not what I expected. What
am I looking at here?
Sir, this steel leaf spring will
ease the stress from the wing.
This wire expands and contracts absorbing
the forces that act on the wing.
I have it running through the
strut and anchoring the fuselage.
That means that we would have to entirely
redesign the length of the wing.
You're right. I'll run those
calculations tonight, sir.
You're wasting your time.
Where is the assignment that
I gave you this morning?
Right here, sir.
I finished it.
Well done. What do
you think, Kurokawa?
It's perfect.
Turn your work in as
soon as you're done!
Yes, sir.
- What a day. I'm heading out.
- Me too.
Wild guess... you already
finished Kurokawa's homework?
Just about.
What are the oxen for?
Oh, they haul the
prototypes to the field.
Takes them 2 days to
drag it out there.
Believe that? That's
how backwards we are.
I don't know. I like them.
Here she comes.
Almost here!
Almost here!
What? This stupid thing.
Damn it!
- Tell me you got it.
- 13.3 seconds. 146 knots.
Blast!
She needs more horsepower.
She deserves better.
Hey!
- Kurokawa!
- Yes, sir.
A word with our clients.
- Gentlemen.
- Well done.
Yeah, your Falcon is
one hell of a plane.
I bet Mitsubishi couldn't do
it. Now I'm buying drinks.
Power dive. He's trying
to break 200 knots.
- His chute.
- Go get him!
Mr. Kurokawa, let's investigate what
happened when the weather clears.
It'll be easier.
- How's the pilot?
- He's okay.
That's good.
Let's go, Mr. Kurokawa. We'll
regroup for Falcon Two.
Jiro, be straight with me. Do you
think the strut fitting failed?
No. I think the problem here is
much deeper and more
complicated than we thought.
I will never forget
what I saw today.
It's like an endless road has
opened up before my eyes.
There won't be a Falcon Two.
The Army has decided to go
with a competing design.
Today was our last shot
to change their minds.
So we have to shift course.
We're going to design and
build a heavy bomber.
With help from the Germans.
You're going to Germany to
study Junker's designs.
I recommended you.
- You still open?
- Ah, welcome back.
Your usual?
- Yeah, but 2 slices this time.
- Coming up.
Here you go.
Who looks out for them?
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.
I feel bad closing the place up.
I see. Well, thanks.
See you tomorrow.
Are you hungry? I have 2
slices of sponge cake.
You can have them. It's
okay, I just bought them.
Go ahead, take it.
Come on!
Jiro?
Wake up! I heard they axed the
Falcon Project. I need details.
- Sponge cake, again?
- Yeah.
How do you stay alive?
What did you expect?
Did you think she was going to
smile and say, "thank you, sir?"
Of course not.
Well, maybe I did.
Well, if you're
looking for a mouth
to feed, there happen to be
plenty of other hungry
kids in this neighborhood.
And their parents are
probably hungrier.
It's shameful.
And I bet it gets worse
before it gets better.
I don't understand why
this country is so poor.
Poor Jiro,
stuck in his happy dreams.
What Japan is paying
the Germans...
they could feed every single man, woman,
and child, a mountain of sponge cake.
But if this country wants airplanes,
then I'm going to make the most of it.
Really? They're sending you too?
They told me today.
That's great!
The fact is, this poor
country pays us...
a lot of money to design
warplanes. Embrace the irony.
I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow.
- To get married.
- Married?
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.
More irony for you.
Good night.
These tight-fisted Germans aren't letting
us see any of Dr. Junker's work.
I don't see any oxen.
Jiro, the airstrip's
right next to the plant.
Wow, everything is so big.
It's a G-38. Is this
what we're buying?
Yup, to convert to a bomber.
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this one?
America, probably.
Not that they could.
This is... something.
It's amazing.
Look, passengers sit in the wings.
It'd be a shame to put bombs there.
That's the job, pal.
This is our chance to get
their all-metal technology.
What? They're not letting us in?
Beautiful.
[Speaks German]
You're not authorized to be here.
You must go back immediately.
Take your hands off him.
You've been slamming doors
in our faces all day.
You Japanese copy everything.
All this technology
belongs to Germany.
Oh, I get it! So you're afraid
we'll actually improve it!
Honjo, let me talk to them.
[Speaks German]
Therefore, we officially have a right to
be in this hangar examining this airplane.
I understand that you
were just doing your job,
but please understand,
I'm just doing mine.
When I saw Dr. Junker's
single engine plane
I had to get a closer look.
I'm not a soldier, simply an engineer
admiring a fellow engineer's work.
Well, as a soldier, my orders are not
to leave you Japanese unattended.
[Speaks German]
That's Dr. Junkers.
What an engineer.
Dr. Junkers gives you
permission to go inside.
So, Jiro, what do you think?
Well, there's more
vibration than I expected.
Our bosses are kids
in a candy store.
Hey! You two should let the
Army rep's sit in here, okay?
Yes, sir.
Just one moment, please.
It's fantastic. What a fortress.
Look, you can walk
through the wing.
Amazing!
It's like being
inside a power plant.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Guten tag. We have permission
to be here from Dr. Junkers.
Would you mind telling us
a bit about your station?
Here is the engineer's station.
It's such a marvelous aircraft.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
Young men, you can't
go any further.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
We understand, my friend.
- Are you seeing this?
- It's incredible.
A triumph of German
industrial technology.
Junkers lets us in, the
Germans shut us out.
These specs are useless!
Jiro, give me a cigarette.
Jiro!
Give me a smoke!
We're out.
It's cold outside, but
this room is quite cozy.
You know that Junkers makes
these radiators too?
Funny, they look just likes his plane's
with such strong parallel lines.
Okay, I get it!
German technology... so superior they
can put wings on anything and fly it.
Including their damn radiators.
Jiro, would you just
give it a rest, please?
We can't learn anything from
these government specs.
They're nothing but a
bunch of pretty numbers.
"This technology
belongs to Germany."
Honjo, maybe we don't need
their technology after all.
Wood and canvas could be
just as good as metal.
Jiro, we can not be stuck
in the past forever.
We're already 20 years behind!
Let's get some air.
My brain is going to explode!
It's as if we're a hare, chasing a
tortoise with a twenty-year lead.
But in our little story,
the hare doesn't sleep.
We can close the gap,
but how can we beat it?
We're too far behind, we'll
always be chasing it.
But what other
choice do we have?
Keep running and
catch up some day?
I wonder if there's a
different way to run.
What is it?
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
That's perfect for us. A
masterpiece of misery and woe.
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
[SPEAKS GERMAN]
What was that?
Secret police. We saw
them in the hangar.
Jiro?
Jiro! I'm done, the
bath is yours.
Dead to the world...
because he thinks he's shouldering
the future of Japanese aviation.
There's a telegram
from headquarters.
- Come in.
- No need.
Some of us will be returning
to Japan right away.
You're staying here in Germany.
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.
West?
They want him to
see the world.
Alone?
Mr. Caproni.
Is the wind still rising?
Yes, sir. It sure is.
Then it's a perfect time to embark
on my final flight. Join me.
Wait! You're retiring?
It's a pretty big jump.
Get on! Jump!
Why are you just sitting
there? Let's go!
There's a hatch
underneath the fuselage.
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir!
Let me through, girls.
Over here!
These are all my workers and their
families. Practically the whole village.
I thought we'd take
a little jaunt
before we deliver this
bomber to the government.
- What do you think?
- Incredible.
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.
This plane is too big to
be used for fighting...
but the military has a
weakness for big things.
Japan could never build anything
as grand and as beautiful as this.
The country is too
poor and backwards.
Inspiration is more
important than scale.
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology, eventually catches up.
That's my family.
We Italians are very poor as
well. Too many mouths to feed.
Hey! Settle down, or the
bottom will fall out!
Come on.
Be careful, eh. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.
Which would you choose, a world
with pyramids or without?
What do you mean?
Humanity has always dreamt of
flight, but the dream is cursed.
My aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.
I know.
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.
Which world will you choose?
I just want to create
beautiful airplanes.
Like that?
Very graceful.
I have a long way to go. I don't even
have an engine or a cockpit yet.
Bravo!
A beautiful dream.
This is my last design.
Artists are only
creative for ten years.
We engineers are no different.
Live your ten years well...
Japanese boy.
Jiro, let's go get some coffee.
- But I've got to go to a...
- Cancel it.
- This is a very tall order.
- They're always tall.
How long have you
been here, Jiro?
- Jiro!
- Huh?
- How long have you been here?!
- Five years.
Jiro, we're going to bid for the
Navy's carrier based fighter.
We think you're ready to be
the plane's chief designer.
It's a plum job.
It's a plum job!
What do you think?
- Leave it to me, sir.
- Good.
I'd like Honjo on the team, sir.
Not a good idea.
You'd just end up competing.
Friendship's are
always more important.
Relax, finish your coffee.
Ah, check, please. Kurokawa!
We've got other plans
for your friend Honjo.
Damn these Japanese engines!
Damn these short runways.
I brought some clean uniforms.
Oh, thanks you very much.
These are spiffy uniforms!
Yes, we're ready!
Man overboard!
Stop!
Father!
Bravo!
That was a nice catch.
It nearly took you away.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Thank you. I will make sure
that it stays grounded.
Yes, sir.
I feel bad. I wanted
to say thank you.
A nice young man. Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel. You'll
have a chance to say thank you.
What is it, Dear?
There's something...
something about that man
who caught the parasol.
Ah, he seems to be
here by himself.
I'm... I'm very sorry.
Please don't go.
I was giving thanks
to this spring.
I asked it to bring you here.
I asked it to bring you to me.
You haven't changed at all
from that day years ago.
You look just the same.
We were so grateful for your
help after the earthquake.
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.
Oh, I remember.
My name is Nahoko Satomi.
I'm Jiro Horikoshi.
This umbrella is useless!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Kinu searched for you for years.
Then she found you just
before she got married.
She cried for joy after she
dropped off your shirt.
You see, you were our
knight in shining armor.
Your knight?
Yes, I think I remember,
you were on a white horse.
Well, I'm not doing much
now to keep you dry.
It's okay. I don't mind at all.
Kinu will be so excited
when I tell her.
I found our hero again.
Oh, your painting's ruined.
No, it's not...
I'll always remember this
day when I look at it.
Oh, look, it's clearing up.
It's like another land!
Oh, Jiru... look!
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.
Life's wonderful, isn't it?
Oh, we should go! My father's
probably worried sick.
There he is!
Father!
Come with me. I'd really
love to introduce you.
Of course.
You're soaking wet.
No, no, I'm fine.
I was just with Mr. Horikoshi.
He saved me again.
Jiro Horikoshi.
I'm Satomi. It's so very good
to meet you, Mr. Horikoshi.
May I sit here?
Certainly.
German tobacco. I've been
saving it. Last one.
I understand. Japanese cigarettes
always taste like home to me.
You must have visited Germany,
yes? Perhaps to Dessau.
Wow, you must be
Sherlock Holmes.
You read magazines,
German magazines
about airplanes.
All Japanese engineers
visit Dessau.
It's elementary...
My dear Watson.
You cracked the case.
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- In trouble?
He fights the hand that
feeds him and he will lose.
He fights Mr. Hitler's
government?
The Nazis are a
gang of hoodlums.
This is quite a good place.
No mosquitoes. Not too
hot. Good watercress.
A good place to forget bad
things. Isn't that right?
Cigarette? I'm afraid
they're Japanese.
Thank you.
It is a nice night. Hier
ist Der Zauberberg.
"The Magic Mountain"
Thomas Mann.
Yes. A good place
for forgetting.
Make a war in China. Forget it.
Make a puppet state in
Manchuria. Forget it.
Quit the League of
Nations. Forget it.
Make the world your
enemy. Forget it.
Japan will blow up.
Germany will blow up too.
Do you think Germany
will go to war again?
Yes. They must be stopped.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Nahoko has a fever.
We'll have to cancel
our dinner plans.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope that she
feels better soon.
The doctor will be
here soon. I must go.
"Who has seen the wind?"
"Neither I nor you."
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."
Let the wind carry
these wings...
carry these wings to you.
Jiro?
Oh, Nahoko!
Be careful!
Nice catch.
Bravo! Bravo.
Well, is your daughter
feeling better?
Yes. Thank you. Much better.
Wonderful.
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.
I think you're right.
At the beginning, this
young man was very gloomy.
Now he's very happy.
Because he's in love.
Yes.
But summer love is seasonal.
You will go down the mountain
and forget all about it.
That's not true.
This love of yours,
it wouldn't be about
my daughter, right?
Yes, sir. I love her very much.
Oh...
And I sincerely hope you'll
approve, Mr. Satomi.
Well...
I don't... umm...
Father!
I would very much like to
have your approval too.
Now there is a beauty.
But Jiro, there's something
I need you to understand.
Anything.
My mother died of
tuberculosis two years ago,
And now I have it too.
Nahoko, I'm in love with you.
Nothing's ever going to stop me.
I've loved you since the day
the wind brought you to me.
Will you please marry me.
Yes.
But first I'm going to get well.
Will you please wait for me?
I will. Even if it
takes a hundred years.
Congratulations.
He's a nice young man. And
your daughter is wonderful.
This is a summer to remember.
If it isn't long lost Jiro.
Honjo!
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.
Hot, isn't it?
Come, take a look at this.
She's beautiful.
Good clean lines.
They gave me free rein, so
I designed something radical, but...
it won't amount to anything
if she doesn't fly.
Oh, I'm sure she'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.
Honjo, you have closed the gap,
and in one huge step!
My plane was just
a tin duckling.
But, here's an idea for you.
I thought of it too late
to implement in my plane.
It's a way to reduce drag
by using flat head screws
on all the access hatches
and the fueling port.
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.
I think a spring of this
diameter should be fine.
Jiro, that's it! What a
great idea! As usual.
You should use it.
Thanks, pal, but not this time.
I'll keep these, but I won't
use them before you.
Your idea belongs
in your next plane.
Thanks, Honjo.
You're welcome, but
you better hurry up.
Jiro! Where are you?!
Mr. Kurokawa.
Jiro?
Get back to the office!
Thanks.
I'm coming.
Come to the house for
a drink next time?
Sure!
Jiro, you pedal.
The Secret Police are
looking for you.
Oh! What?!
Did you hear me? The
thought crime boys.
- But why me?
- Didn't ask.
I told them you were away.
They're just pretending to
leave? We won't fall for that.
You'll work up here
today. I've arranged it.
But why would they
possibly be after me?
I don't understand.
They've already arrested
some of my friends.
None of them understood why.
- Enter.
- Here's your stuff.
Hi.
I think we got everything.
I can go back and check.
Naw, just leave it and go.
- Jiro, the flange is here!
- Can't wait to see it.
- It's perfect.
- Sure is.
I wish we had that a year ago.
So, what do you think, Jiro?
Our next plane won't
just be a duckling,
it'll be a full grown duck.
A full metal duck.
Mr. Kurokawa, what do you think?
I hope you youngsters appreciate the
luxury of extruded aluminum alloy.
That's it! Now back to work!
- The coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.
You should keep a low profile
for a few days, just in case.
We'll try to smooth things over.
I'll put you up at my house.
Can we stop at my apartment
first? I have to check my mail.
- Is it sensitive?
- Yes, it's very sensitive.
The police will be
opening all your mail.
It's from my fiancée.
This is outrageous.
These things
shouldn't happen in
a modern country.
You're engaged?
You're a human after all.
I thought you would
marry an airplane.
I don't find that very funny.
Of course it's not funny. The police
are waiting for you at your apartment.
If they want to read your
love letters, let them.
Jiro, we need you to refocus
on the fighter project.
That's why we sent you away,
to rest, after the crash.
The company will do
everything to protect you.
If you keep your
mind on your work.
I can't bear being
apart from you.
Why do you suppose the police
are looking for Mr. Castorp?
He left so suddenly.
I pray every day that he
managed to leave Japan safely.
Jiro, you have a telephone call.
- The telephone's over there.
- Thank you, Mrs. Kurokawa.
- Hello?
- Jiro? It's me.
- You have a telegram.
- Yes?
Your landlord received it 2 days ago,
but just brought it in here now.
Would you please read it to me?
- Now?
- Yes!
"Nahoko... has had
a lung... hem..."
"hemorrhage. Satomi."
Jiro, are you still there?
Thank you. I have to go now.
Jiro, wait!
What is it?
Mrs. Kurokawa, please, I need to know
the quickest way to get to Tokyo.
Tokyo? Today?
Yes, it's an emergency. I have
to be there as soon as possible.
All right.
If you take the noon bus, then you'll
just be able to catch the express.
I'll send someone to
hold the bus for you.
- Go get your things.
- Thank you.
Jiya!
Darling!
I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner.
You'll catch it.
You're beautiful.
I love you.
Jiro? Through the garden?
Come in, Father.
Look... look who's here... Jiro.
He came all the way from Nagoya,
but can't stay for long.
I'll be sure to use the front
door the next time I come.
Well, the garden's faster.
Okay, garden it is.
Take care, my darling.
Sleep well.
- Good night, sir.
- I'll see you out.
You'd better hurry if you're
going to catch the last train.
I wish I could look
after her, Mr. Satomi.
She seems so tired.
The last thing Nahoko wants
is to be a burden to you.
You'd better go.
Nahoko?
Are you all right?
I'm going to the sanatorium
in the mountains.
The one the doctor recommended.
But why? It's so far, and
I don't want you to be alone.
Because I want to
get better, Father.
I want to have a life with Jiro.
Just made it! The whole
board is waiting.
So, are you ready?
Gentlemen, I'll do my best.
Now you'll see the Navy.
They're the client.
Gentlemen, I'll do my best.
- You weren't even listening.
- Nope.
So I gave up on that idea.
They're here rather late.
Jiro's in the middle of a
review with the design team.
Oh?
I wanted this design to use the
latest aeronautical advances.
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!
It's built to reach 270 knots.
270 knots? That's 500
kilometers per hour!
But the Navy only
asked for 220 knots.
220 will be obsolete
by next week.
The wing load is 120
kilos per square meter.
Minimal drag will be the key.
I pushed the design to the
limits of technology,
with split flaps and slats
on the leading edges.
But the weight becomes
the big problem.
One solution would be... we
could leave out the guns.
So I decided to put this
design back on the shelf.
This is refreshing. Delightful.
He nearly had it.
But we are not giving up because
engines are underpowered.
We'll build a light,
strong airframe.
We'll cut every ounce
of excess weight
and minimize drag
with a smooth skin.
We're going to build an
all-metal fighter...
like nothing the
world has ever seen.
Mr. Hirayama, please.
This is Mr. Hirayama. He is
our production engineer.
Thank you, sir.
He's going to tell us about the
new rivets that he's developing.
I believe it is technically
possible to match the strength
of conventional rivets with
rivets that are flush.
What's he talking about?
A new way to cut drag.
We're going to skin the
entire plane with flush
rivets to produce a
nimble, fast aircraft.
I must say, that
was interesting.
It was inspiring!
- Miss Satomi... today's letter.
- Thank you.
Chief, you have a phone call.
- I'll have to call them back.
- I think it's an emergency.
Hello, Mr. Satomi. Good
to hear from you, sir.
Yes. Yes. What?!
- Jiro!
- I'm here now.
- Jiro!
- I'm here.
Are you all right, my
love? Can you walk?
Uh huh.
Come.
I have to go back. I just
needed to see you.
No. Don't go back.
We should be together.
- Oh, you must be Nahoko.
- Pleased to meet you.
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Jiro.
Mr. Kurokawa, we have a request.
We have plenty of room, Dear.
I know we have the room.
That is not the problem.
I simply can't approve
of an unmarried couple
living under this roof.
Then we will marry tonight.
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa, will
you please be our witnesses.
What?! Tonight?!
Of course we will, Dear.
Nahoko traveled all this way.
It's the least we can do.
My doctors know about this,
and my father has
given his blessing.
Please help us.
The bride and I have a lot of
work to do, and so do you.
Come, Nahoko.
Oh, don't mind him,
he's always like that.
If you care about
her at all, Jiro,
you'll send her back
in the morning train.
I would have to give up the
fighter project, Mr. Kurakawa,
because I would go with her.
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?
Nahoko doesn't have much time.
We've made our decision.
I see.
All right! So I guess
it's on with the wedding!
Here they come.
She's coming!
Hear me!
I bring to you a lovely maiden
who had come from the mountains
to be with her beloved.
She has given up
everything for him!
What say you?
Hear me!
The man I present is an
insensitive chuckle-head
without even a home
to call his own.
But, if that's what she
wants, she can come in.
And then they shall
exchange the sacred vows.
You are beautiful.
Mr. Kurokawa. Mrs. Kurokawa.
All Jiro and I have in
this world is each other.
I can not thank you
enough for your kindness.
We will never forget
our debt to you.
Nonsense, there is
absolutely no debt to repay.
We're both so happy that
you found each other.
- Aren't we, dear?
- Uh huh.
You're both very, very brave.
You must be exhausted.
I feel like I'm in
a wonderful dream.
It feels like the
room is spinning.
Then... you should try
to get some rest.
Come here.
Are you sure?
Come here.
You're going to tell me you
completely forgot I was coming?
Yes, I completely
forgot you were coming.
You are so insensitive.
Congratulations on
finishing medical school.
Congratulations on your
marriage to Nahoko.
I've come to thank Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa
on behalf of the entire family..
Are they still up?
They have gone to bed.
- So, you met Nahoko?
- Yes.
Jiro, what are you going to do?
She's alone in
that room all day.
You wouldn't know it, because
you come home so late.
Do you know she puts rouge on
her cheeks so you won't worry.
Nahoko's condition is much
worse than you think, Jiro.
I know, because at school
I've watched as people...
She's my sister now.
I really like her.
How can you do this to her?
Does Nahoko really
have to stay here?
Yes...
she does.
Because... each day together
is very precious to us now.
Get some rest. We can
talk more in the morning.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm home.
- I must have dozed off.
- Go back to sleep.
Thank you.
- Did you see your sister?
- Yes.
I like her a lot.
So confident and strong.
She's got such a bright
future ahead of her.
I told her I wanted
her to be my doctor.
And she brought me a
gift from your mother,
this nightgown and robe.
See, she made it for me.
Is that too bright?
No, it's fine.
I have to finish the
design by tomorrow.
Your mackerel bones?
You remembered.
I think I may have a way
to make it a bit lighter.
Come a little closer.
Give me your hand.
This is nice.
I really like looking at
while you're working, Jiro.
In a contest for one-handed
slide rule users,
I'd win first prize for sure.
Look at that. I can make each
rib half an ounce lighter.
You can? That's good.
Thirty ribs, that almost
makes about a pound.
See, I knew it.
You work better when
you're holding my hand.
You're right.
If only I could leave my hand
right here for the test flight.
You, my dear, should
get some sleep.
- Don't let go.
- I won't let go.
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?
No. Smoke here.
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.
Hey, Honjo.
Can I take a look?
Sure. I hear good things
about your heavy bomber.
Ah, it's not bad.
Jiro, she's beautiful!
The infamous flush riveting.
Feels a little rough.
Yeah, we're still
learning how to do it.
Well, you'll get it.
You already left the
Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.
This design is classic Jiro,
right down to the
mackerel bones.
Jiro, is it all right if
I use your flush rivets,
and that spring loaded hatch?
Uh huh. Of course.
Can't you redesign?
Yeah, I wanted to
redo the whole thing,
but they only let me
touch the fuselage.
But, what about the wings?
That's what keeps me up at night.
The wings still carry all the fuel.
And I can't shield them, because
she has to fly over 1800 miles.
It's already too heavy. We can't
even add an once of weight.
So without a redesign, Japan's
first advance bomber,
only need 2 or 3 hits and
she'll burn like a torch.
And who are the going
to bomb with it?
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.
Japan will blow up.
We're not arms merchants. We just
want to build good aircraft.
That's right.
Good night, pal. Try
to get some sleep.
You too.
Boss, I'm calling it a day.
Good night, sir.
Goodnight.
Welcome home.
My planes finished. Now
we'll see how she flies.
Congratulations.
We worked so hard.
The oxen are taking
her to the field now.
I'll probably have to spend
the next few nights there.
You must be tired, my love.
Just a little.
She will fly beautifully.
Hmm, she will.
I couldn't have done
it without you here.
I love you, Jiro.
Nahoko...
I'm off.
Good luck.
What are you doing up?
I'm feeling so much better
today, Mrs. Kurakawa,
so I thought I'd take a walk.
Be careful.
- Don't tire yourself out.
- I know.
The room's still a mess. But I'll
straighten up when I get back.
All right. But remember,
Kayo is coming soon, to be here
for her brother's celebration.
Yes. I'll be back soon.
Then please come inside.
Oh! Oh, no.. no.
She left us letters!
This letter's for me.
Says she's going
to the sanatorium!
I'll find her.
No! Let her go.
We shouldn't do anything until
after Nahoko's train leaves.
She wants him to always
remember her as she was.
Wonderful. Just look at her.
A true Japanese fighter.
What about speed?
How'd she do?
The numbers, they are off the
charts. We're checking them again.
How fast is she?!
- Two four oh.
- Two forty!
Hey, Jiro!
Hey, Jiro!
She flies like a
dream. Thank you.
So, we meet again, Japanese boy.
Mr. Caproni...
I remember this place. This
is where we first met.
In our kingdom of dreams.
Now it's the land of the dead.
Not quite. But in
some ways, yes.
But what about your
ten years in the sun,
did you live them well?
Yes. Things fell apart
in the end, though.
That's what happens
when you lose a war.
There is your fighter.
Truly, truly, a
masterful design.
Not a single one returned.
There was nothing to return to.
Airplanes are beautiful
cursed dreams...
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.
Someone is waiting for you.
Nahoko...
She has been waiting here
for a long time.
You must live, Darling.
You must live...
She was beautiful,
like the wind.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You must live.
But now, shall we
drop by my house?
I have some very excellent wine.
