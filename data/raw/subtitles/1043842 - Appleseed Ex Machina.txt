In the year 2133...
...the world was thrust
into an era of devastation and chaos.
More than half of the Earth's population
was killed off by nonnuclear global war.
It was only a matter of time
before the planet itself...
...would become utterly uninhabitable
and all life there would cease to exist.
Humans searched
for a last seed of hope.
When they could not find it,
they created one:
Olympus.
In this utopia, those injured in the war
were reconditioned as human cyborgs.
International disputes were buffered
by a breed of genetically engineered...
...humans called bioroids, who were
designed never to feel anger or hatred.
All right, gang, listen up.
We got a heavily armed group
holed up in an abandoned church...
...with top-ranking EU officials
as hostages.
Don't know who they are
or what they want.
Local police haven't taken them down,
so you know the drill.
You could be looking at combat cyborgs.
We move in at 2245 sharp.
Synchronize your watches
to 2230 on my mark.
Three, two, one...
...now.
A high-tech cyborg wearing
an analog watch. Well, look at that.
Has its own heartbeat, just like I do.
The sound of it will get your ass shot.
Tell him, Deunan. He's your partner.
Well, I'll be.
You two are made for each other.
Approaching landing zone.
Drop point confirmed.
Drop point clear. All units, deploy.
Let's go! We don't have much time!
I'm outside the corridor and I'm going in.
Launch assault in 30 seconds.
All units, stand by.
- Flash grenade inside the cathedral.
- Damn you, Deunan.
All right, prepare to move in.
On my count.
Three, two, one.
Kill them!
Cover me. Fire!
Secure the hostages.
You all right?
- Watch the hostage.
- Got it.
They're all cyborgs.
What the hell's going on?
Let's ask them.
I think they're in the mood to talk now.
Who are you? What do you want?
Do you hear me? Answer me.
All will be one. We will all be one.
I am Halcon.
He's gonna blow. Move it.
Deunan, are you all right?
Briareos?
Briareos! Don't...
- Deunan, stop.
- Let go.
Let go of me, goddamn it!
Briareos. Briareos!
Attention, all units. We have a
disturbance reported in Sector B-47...
...involving a construction Landmate.
Request ES.W.A.T. Dispatch.
Team 2, proceed to WASP hangar
in Delta Formation at once.
Repeat, disturbance in Sector B-47.
Request ES.W.A.T. Dispatch.
Team 2, report to the WASP hangar
in Delta Formation at once.
Captain.
- Deunan?
- I heard the call.
I'm near B-47 right now.
Aren't you supposed to be
off-duty today?
Well, things change.
We're on our way.
Don't do anything stupid, Deunan.
You hear me?
Run! Run!
- What's happening?
- He got fired.
Next thing you know,
he grabbed a Landmate.
He's going to turn the place...
Oh, God.
Get up.
- Where's the kill switch?
- On his back.
Unit 1 ready.
Don't treat me like a fool!
Goddamn you!
You're late.
Got it. I saw it.
Damn it!
Get off of me! Damn it!
Get off! Shit! Get off!
You little bitch! Get off!
What are you doing?
Let me out of here.
You bitch!
Looks like we missed the party.
I told you to play it cool.
Where is he?
Back there, on the ground.
Who's the new guy?
Oh, yeah, right.
I have to introduce you.
Some other time, Lance.
Today is my day off.
Deunan Knute, meet Tereus.
Your new partner.
What the hell are you thinking, Nike?
Watch your mouth, Deunan.
Did you forget that my
partner is in the hospital?
- I can't believe that you'd do this to me.
- Well, believe it.
Tereus is the only one whose
fighting potential compares to Briareos.
That's not what I'm talking about
and you know it.
Why does your new partner
look remarkably similar to Briareos...
...before he became a cyborg?
Isn't that what you want to know?
Come with me, Deunan.
This facility is, for the most part,
just like its predecessor.
We continue to create bioroids
from the very same DNA as you humans...
...genetically deleting negative emotions.
As you know, bioroids are,
more often than not, diplomats, emissaries...
...and, like your friend Hitomi,
ministers of political affairs.
Bioroids must act as a
regulating force within society.
So we decided to produce bioroids
with high combat capabilities...
...to further uphold public order.
Tereus is serving as our prototype.
He fights to preserve law and order.
And unlike humans, anger and hatred
will never influence his decision to fight.
The majority of his genetic code
was taken from Briareos.
Why did you choose Briareos?
After analyzing combat data
from all soldiers in ES.W.A. T...
...we found him to be by far
the most qualified of all candidates.
And then there is
his Hecatonchire-class body.
Briareos is the only person who
has been able to adapt to it.
His physical and mental strength
is truly remarkable.
You were his former partner.
That's why we need you to
assess Tereus' capabilities.
I won't do it.
I'm not asking.
- Deunan.
- Hitomi, you're back.
I just got back from
the World Trade Expo.
I heard about Briareos.
- Yes?
- Deunan, it's Lance.
Briareos is waking up.
I'll be right there.
As the prime minister of Olympus...
...I strongly advocate
a global security network.
This would entail bringing
all the world's surveillance...
...as well as communication satellites
under the control of Olympus.
This will enhance our...
Hey, what...? What are those things?
Always behind the times,
aren't you, Deunan?
Yeah, yeah.
Here, check it out.
It's called a Connexus.
It's the most advanced personal
multimedia terminal ever made.
Makes life so much easier.
Try it on.
Everybody's got one.
It's an amazing piece of technology.
And anyone can use it just by accessing
the free open-source codes.
That's the best thing about it.
Hey, go ahead
and open that message on the right.
What is it?
A birthday party?
Promise me you'll come, okay?
So how old are you gonna be?
Just because I'm a bioroid doesn't
mean that I'll tell you my age.
Briareos.
Hold it right there, honey.
You have to be gentle, all right?
After all, they just put him back together.
We should be able to be release him
in just over a week.
- Are you serious?
- He's a lucky man.
Dr. Kestner is the chief
professor at the academy...
...not to mention the foremost expert
on cyborg medical science.
Your buddy's in good hands.
Hell, he's even my doctor.
You're being too kind, I'm afraid.
I'll leave you all to your visit.
So, what's new?
It's like we thought it was.
The investigation at the church
revealed all the terrorists were cyborgs.
We've taken another look
at the five most recent terror incidents.
Four were carried out entirely by cyborgs.
Cyborg terrorists? What are they after?
That's what I'd like to know.
But we do have a couple of leads to go on.
We've found unidentified frequencies,
all of them in the surrounding areas.
Pattern looks like
a puppet-master program from the war.
They're being brainwashed.
It's a possibility.
The problem is that most
cyborgs out there...
...have poorly protected
systems, unlike us.
If someone is manipulating
civilian cyborgs for terrorist acts...
Things are gonna get a lot hotter
on our end.
Furthermore, we have no idea
who we're dealing with or what they want.
- So get off your ass, we need you.
- What are you talking about?
I can't go on active duty like this.
When can all these wires come off?
- Don't pull. You're not my doctor.
- Come on.
Let go of that.
Here we go again.
Here, I fixed it for you.
This thing's tougher than I am.
You heard about the new guy,
Tereus, right?
Yeah. Before you came.
Well, I don't care what they say.
You're my partner,
no matter what happens.
Deunan, get back!
- Deunan, talk to me. Are you all right?
- Briareos.
Am l...?
Am I alive?
Yeah, you're alive.
Thank you.
I'll always protect you,
even if the world comes to an end.
I know you will.
I am Yoshino from Poseidon.
And I am Nike,
the chief of staff of Olympus.
Prime Minister Athena
has been expecting you.
As you can see, many of the cyborgs
involved in the terrorist incidents...
...were equipped with components
made by Poseidon.
I would like to know...
...what are your thoughts on the matter,
Emissary Yoshino?
We have tracked down
the cyborg parts in question...
...to the lab that manufactured them,
and shut it down immediately.
Other departments have enacted
countermeasures as well.
However...
...it would be regrettable
to draw connections...
...between these terrorists and Poseidon.
So then you're saying Poseidon had nothing
to do with the latest terrorist attacks?
Prime minister, you're well aware...
...that Poseidon is the largest
industrial conglomerate in the world.
Our profits come from trade
with other countries.
Siding with terrorists would give
no financial benefits whatsoever.
If Olympus were to boycott our products,
other countries would follow your lead.
Clearly, the negative impact
would not be in our best interest.
That may be, but we have issued
the same message...
...to all the businesses
that may have been involved.
We cannot afford to give Poseidon
special consideration.
One of the topics at
the peace conference...
...is your desire to enhance surveillance...
...by controlling
international satellite systems...
...is it not?
This hyper-sheath contains the master
control program to our satellite network.
Consider it a gift.
- Cutting a deal, are we?
- Our contribution to global welfare.
Not something I'd expect to hear
from a business that makes tools for war.
Olympus is no stranger
to military prowess.
You know that you can't
protect the world without force.
We'll review our options and
speak with you at another time.
We will look forward
to a favorable reply.
Great. Keep them coming.
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Hitomi.
Happy birthday.
It was so sweet of you all
to come tonight.
I hope all of you have a great time.
You look great. Happy birthday.
Thank you, Yoshitsune.
Looks like you've got a
surprise guest hiding over there.
Come on, get over here. Come on.
- Well, take a look at Deunan.
- You clean up nice.
Well...
- Yeah.
- Okay, enough already.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
Have a good time.
We have good things in store
for you tonight too.
- Just look over there.
- What?
Briareos.
- Does this mean you're okay?
- Not quite.
Something's wrong with my eyescope.
I'm seeing a Deunan that
I've never seen before.
Tonight we're also celebrating
Briareos' full recovery.
I had no idea.
Happy birthday, Hitomi.
How lovely.
Thank you so much.
Oh, yeah. You two still haven't met yet,
have you?
Briareos, meet Tereus.
Well, Briareos at last.
It's nice to meet you.
Is this supposed to be a costume party?
This guy's wearing a mask
with my old face.
To be honest,
it wasn't exactly my own choice.
Sounds exactly like me too.
So I have my old partner back now?
I meant to talk to you about that.
Afraid I need you to stick with Tereus
a little longer.
- I'll team up with Aeacus for a while.
- What do you mean?
I saw your combat data with him.
Not bad.
Wait, is this some kind of joke?
Because I'm not laughing.
Think about it, Deunan.
They fixed me twice.
Who are you gonna partner with...
...if they can't do it a third time?
- Then I won't partner with anyone.
Deunan.
Seems Briareos was pretty worried
about you.
Do I look like I care?
And so what if he is, anyway?
- Another one.
- Better make that a coffee.
Espresso. With a shot of liqueur.
Look, Deunan,
I know you're not too fond of me...
...but I gotta admit that I'm really glad
they chose you as my partner.
All I ask is that you stick with me
a little longer.
What's the matter?
Did Briareos tell you
how I like to drink it?
No.
Go home.
I'll drop you off.
Leave me alone.
I get confused.
I get confused when I'm with you.
No problem.
The Hecatonchires were giants
with a hundred arms, right?
That's mythology...
...but now it's a system that can control
multiple external networks.
And you are the only one,
the only man they could find...
...who was able to adapt
to the H-class machine body.
Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.
It sure sucks, don't it,
being a cyborg and all?
It has its drawbacks.
So, what you gonna do, pretty boy?
With Deunan, I mean.
Not too many girls out there
who'll stay with you...
...once you're more of a machine
than a man.
It hasn't crossed my mind.
Nobody ever said love was easy, pal.
What about you? You got a girl?
She making you wear jewelry?
Oh, you mean this.
No, it's just my Connexus.
My daughter gave it to me.
She's got one to match it.
What, you're being a cyborg
isn't enough metal on you already?
Once you start you can't stop.
- You're an addict.
- Hey, don't break the merchandise.
Leaders from all over the world are arriving
now amid both fanfare and heavy security.
All cyborgs have been cleared
from the premises, sir.
Continuing security checks.
Deunan, time to go.
- Right.
- What's wrong?
About the other night, l...
- Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
We're partners.
I've got your back, no matter what.
I guess I can count on you.
You didn't know that?
This worldwide peace summit
and conference of dignitaries...
...may very well forge our future.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now open discussions to the floor.
Prime Minister Athena is in.
We are green.
Okay.
All units, look alive. Here we go.
Looks like it's starting.
All right. Let's hope nothing happens.
Don't sweat it, partner.
If the shit hits the fan,
ES.W.A.T. Will handle it.
Hell, that's why they pay us the big bucks,
isn't it?
And by merging
each country's satellite systems...
...we will create a unified
global communications network.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we believe this will quell conflicts...
...and terrorist attacks
before they ever happen...
...helping ensure peace
for future generations.
Obviously, this was simply an overview
of the proposed global security network.
For the good of mankind, I urge you all...
...to place your countries' satellites
under Olympus' control.
The recent incident
that occurred in our country...
...was handled by the Olympus ES.W.A.T.
In a very expeditious manner.
A truly secure network, as you propose,
would be a phenomenal...
My country already has the means
to protect itself from terrorism...
...without having to rely on
Olympus' support.
Or perhaps your country might have things
you don't want anyone else to see.
What do you mean?
Would you care to elaborate on that?
Sources indicate that your country
supports several regional conflicts...
That's ridiculous!
How dare you make such an accusation.
Enough of this. Why should Olympus
be in control of the satellite systems?
- How do we know bioroids can be trusted?
- I agree.
This discussion
has nothing to do with race.
Captain, I'm detecting
an unidentified data frequency.
- From where?
- Multiple signals. They're everywhere.
All units, be on the alert.
Landmate units, prepare to move out.
Code 3.
All right, Aeacus. Let's move.
You go on ahead.
Just give me a minute, buddy.
I'll be right behind you.
You all right?
- I'll be okay.
- Okay.
All right, you can go.
Next.
Hey.
Stop.
Stop. I said stop!
- It's not stopping.
- We're gonna have to take him out.
Fire. Fire.
Disturbance reported at Gate E-12.
Okay, Aeacus. I'm heading out.
This is Tartaros, Front Gate, A-2.
Unauthorized vehicles
have breached the outer perimeter.
This is Gate F-7.
Our position is also being overrun.
Copy that.
Keep the premises secure at all cost.
Order the Landmates
to start mobilizing now.
Deunan, Tereus,
I need you to back up the police in the area.
Keep the assailants away
from the conference hall.
Yes, sir.
Minister, areas around the conference hall
are under attack.
Suspend proceedings
and ensure your safety.
Nonsense. We will continue.
Unauthorized Landmate. Fire.
It's a construction Landmate.
It's not a cyborg.
What's going on here?
Deunan. You okay?
Yeah.
What the hell is going on here?
Those aren't cyborgs. They're humans.
You still here?
Better get down there,
sounds like all hell's breaking loose.
Do you need something?
All will be one. We will all be one.
I am Halcon.
Aeacus?
- What was that?
- Is it a terrorist?
- We must get out of here.
- It's an explosion. Look!
- We stop this meeting immediately.
- We should evacuate.
Quiet, please.
There is no need to panic.
This conference hall is heavily fortified.
Gentlemen, please return to your seats.
Let us resume the discussion.
Aeacus. What's wrong? Answer me.
Stop it!
- Everyone get back!
- Get out!
Let's get out of here.
Take a good look!
This is the reality of the world
we now live in.
The time to decide on
this proposal is now.
Or do you want to create
more unnecessary casualties?
Stop! Aeacus!
Briareos!
All will be one. Do you understand?
Stop it!
Damn it!
Stop it. Aeacus!
Aeacus, no!
Aeacus, why?
Briareos.
Briareos, I...
Briareos!
It's a robot!
The frequency's coming from the doves.
Looks like the Tartaros Conference Hall
is stabilized and under control.
Signal's gone.
Hey. What's happening to them?
The attackers at each of the gates
have been suppressed.
Several casualties.
The unidentified data frequency
seems to have vanished.
The Lord has called
our brother Aeacus home.
Let us pray for his soul.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
May the Lord lead him unto heaven
and grant him...
...eternal rest.
Am I stable?
I saw his face melt away...
...as he attacked me.
What if I'm losing my sanity too?
You worry too much.
Everyone knows
that you did what you had to do.
Salute.
What are you looking for?
Your flesh has melded with the matrix
of the Hecatonchire system so perfectly...
...you're practically a work of art.
Have faith. If this technology doesn't work,
no cyborg is safe from this chaos.
I know what happened to Aeacus
came as a terrible shock...
...but something like that
could never happen to you.
I see.
Thanks, doc.
Briareos.
Do you like this city?
Do you believe Olympus truly is a utopia
that's worthy of risking your life?
I don't know.
But what I do know is that as long as
there's someone in this city I care about...
...I intend to protect it.
Sacrifice and love, huh?
In all my years, I have found those ideals
led only to human anguish.
Wouldn't you agree?
No, I don't.
Not always.
Oh, but it does.
Although the peace conference...
...was temporarily disrupted
by an organized attack...
...discussions ended successfully
with regard to its primary topic...
...allowing world leaders to...
As a result of our debate
at the Olympus Assembly...
...we will resume normal trade
with Poseidon...
...with one notable exception.
Certain cyborg parts.
Thank you, prime minister,
for your consideration.
I'll let our headquarters know
immediately.
We've received the latest report
on the attack at Tartaros Conference Hall.
- There's something that concerns me.
- What is it?
According to this, one of the rioters
was reported to have said, "I am Halcon."
Lmpossible.
Halcon is nothing more
than a memory.
There's no way they could be involved.
ID verified.
Thank you.
Can I ask you to spar with me?
Why not ask Deunan?
I'd prefer to spar with you.
Not bad there, kid.
That was a good kick.
Are you content now?
Nobody can compete with Briareos.
That bioroid did fairly well.
We've determined the unidentified data
frequency detected during the incident...
...was being transmitted
by the robotic doves.
We believe they were responsible.
They transmitted a virus program
to the cyborgs, triggering the uprising.
What we don't know...
...is how regular non-cyborg humans
were involved in the attack as well.
But the investigation is still under way
and we should know more soon.
Right now, evidence suggests
cyborg terrorists were behind this attack.
Whether or not Aeacus was collaborating
with the terrorists remains to be seen.
At the same time,
we can't ignore the possibility...
...that ES.W.A.T.'s
virus protection programs for cyborgs...
...may have been compromised.
So effective immediately, we will suspend
participation of cyborg troops.
- What?
- This is bullshit.
- Non-cyborgs were involved as well.
- You treat us like criminals for this.
As long as the enemy's objectives
remain unclear, we have no choice.
That is all. Dismissed.
Man, forget this. I'm out of here.
I don't need this crap.
I'm with you.
Yoshitsune.
Yeah?
Would you run some tests on this?
Some sort of biochip?
Where did you get this from?
Off one of the rioters.
Just check it out for me, will you?
- No problem. I'll check it out.
- Thanks a lot.
Tereus.
Let's have a drink.
No, thanks, I'm busy.
The backup always follows the point man.
You heard the lady.
Centralized management
of each country's satellites...
...along with the proposed system
of information sharing...
...could be a first step towards fulfilling
the wishes of those who long for peace...
...in our postwar society.
So where to?
Feel like a pub or sports bar?
- Sports bar.
- Sports bar.
- Pub. That's what I meant to...
- Pub. That's what I meant to...
We go now live to a message
from Prime Minister Athena.
Momentarily, we will demonstrate...
...what can happen when the satellites
of 32 nations come together...
...to form a willing alliance.
According to Greek mythology...
...the olive tree
is a symbol of peace and prosperity.
It is my belief
that mankind's desire for peace...
...will soon unite our world.
- It's like a carnival.
- Yeah. Looks like fun.
Look out!
Briareos!
Nobody's driving it.
- The information terminal?
- Briareos!
Stop it. What's gotten into you?
What's wrong with you?
Look out!
Tereus!
What's happening to you?
Briareos, stop it.
I said, stop, Briareos!
What are you doing?
Briareos!
Error in the satellite monitoring system!
Electrical supply system malfunction!
We're being hacked into from the outside!
Code yellow!
Go to subsystem B, just to be safe.
Copy that. Switching to B.
The unidentified data frequency
wasn't detected in that area.
So they ruled that out as the cause.
I think they wanna conduct drug tests
and a psych exam on him.
So where is he now?
He's here, in the isolation ward.
Did you see him?
He didn't want me to, so no.
I see.
- I can do that.
- Of course.
I'll go on my rounds and be right back.
Turn around.
Okay. Thanks.
This birthmark.
Briareos had the same one.
What's happening to Briareos?
That biochip you wanted me to check out?
Part of a Connexus.
I put a Connexus on this lab rat.
Watch what happens
when I transmit the same frequency...
...from one of the robotic doves
to this rat.
It's like he has no control.
When activated, the Connexus emits
a signal that stimulates nerve tissue.
In other words,
it can potentially be used...
...to manipulate
both humans and cyborgs at will.
That would explain why non-cyborgs
were involved in the attack.
Exactly.
So that means Aeacus
was innocent, then.
Just being used
like the people in the riots were.
This isn't simple cyborg terrorism.
This is something much bigger.
Then the terrorist attack on Tartaros
was just some kind of test.
I don't know how, but we gotta
get these things off the street.
Is it true?
Did I really attack Deunan?
What's happening to me?! What?!
They don't know,
and that's why she's worried.
She wants to see you.
No.
Not now.
Maybe there's something I can do.
Richard Kestner.
He's been with the Olympus
Science Academy since 2135...
...but he worked for Poseidon before that.
Poseidon?
Keep going. What else does it say?
Let me try to access
Olympus' host computer.
Chief Technician of New Technology
Elizabeth Xander.
Halcon Laboratory.
- Halcon?
- I'll look it up.
Everything has been erased.
Is Kestner behind this?
Kestner never would have been able
to remove that amount of data...
...from a global network on his own.
Someone else must be behind this.
It must be Poseidon.
Hitomi, cover your ears.
Briareos, no! Stop it.
- I need to pay the good doctor a visit!
- Please, don't do this! You could get...
- Over here!
- Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
We have to evacuate the hospital.
- You get out, I have to find someone. Go.
- You can't. We have to leave.
Aren't you listening to me?
Leave me alone.
Hang on.
Attention, citizens: The Connexus
is now considered to be a harmful product.
If you are a Connexus user...
- What are they talking about?
- I can't live without this thing.
Repeat, the Connexus is considered
to be a harmful product.
We'll be lucky if even 10 percent
of the population turn them in.
I want enforcement measures
taken as early as tomorrow.
- Of course.
- Nike.
- What is it?
- Briareos has escaped from the hospital.
He's taken Vice Minister Hitomi hostage.
You're all aware of Briareos' capabilities.
Don't you ever let your guard down.
All right, move out.
Deunan Knute.
I want you to withdraw
from this assignment.
- What are you talking about?
- That's a direct order. You understand me?
Remain here on standby. Got it?
Pull your vehicle
to the side of the road immediately.
Surrender or we will take hostile action.
- What do we do?
- Do what they want.
I repeat, stop your vehicle immediately.
Thanks for the lift.
- Do you want a gun?
- Don't need one.
We've taken the hostage
into protective custody.
The fugitive's whereabouts
are still unknown.
So where is he? Where did he go?
Why are you asking me?
How would I know?
If you don't answer me,
I will simply ask myself.
Then I'll know where to go.
It looks like the fugitive
took Harbor Way Number 4...
...and exited somewhere near Cygnus.
We're currently inspecting all vehicles
within a 1-kilometer radius of the area.
You should do some decorating.
I can tell you live alone.
Oh, no.
I am never exactly alone.
What have you done to my body?
It's impossible to control your body
using data frequencies from the outside.
Fortunately, your little incident
gave me the perfect opportunity...
...to add a rather special feature to
that Hecatonchire body of yours.
Nanomachines.
You did what?
They're ravenous feeders,
and now they feed off of you.
It's a fascinating program, really...
...activated the instant
that your adrenaline levels...
...rise just beyond a certain point.
You do realize that the hacking incident
you caused was all part of the plan.
You see, I found
it would be very difficult...
...to infiltrate the main control room
of the satellite command center.
So I performed a little trick
on their backup module.
All that was needed then
was to crash the main system.
And you did that wonderfully.
Why are you doing this?
Do you know why this world
can never exist without bloodshed?
Individual differences, of course.
Different hearts, different minds.
That is the essence of all conflict.
But if our world was converted
to a single, united consciousness...
You're the one.
You're the one behind the attacks.
No. I have comrades all over the world.
Fix what you've done to me!
It's too late for that.
And now, it's time.
System error.
We've lost control of the satellites.
All links to the satellites are cut off.
What the hell is going on?
- Backup system's out too.
- Try it again.
- What are you trying to do?
Assimilation and natural selection.
Those that cannot be integrated
will be eliminated.
Thanks to the Connexus
and the global satellite network...
...mankind will be united
once and for all.
Imagine a world without
misunderstanding or discrimination.
The elimination of all human conflict
and the banishment of war.
My vision and Halcon's ideals
will finally become our reality and truth.
- Halcon.
- The global security network is down.
We've lost control of the satellites.
Repeat, we've lost control of the satellites.
They waited for the satellites to unite
before hijacking them.
Even the attack on the peace summit
must have been thoroughly designed.
Prime minister, if they use...
If they transmit that signal to Connexus
via satellites...
- Nike, issue an alert to the alliance nations.
- At once.
Don't worry.
My friend,
in but a moment you will understand.
Mechanical or not,
our bodies are just vessels.
We must set ourselves free.
Kestner. Don't do it!
- We've got him! He's here!
- Stay where you are. Don't move!
Freeze! Put your hands up! Now!
We've found the fugitive cyborg.
There's a man down. Send an ambulance.
- Hold it.
- Freeze!
Shit, he jumped.
He went down.
Suspect jumped out of the window.
Find him!
We will continue pursuit.
Briareos is still on the run.
He's considered armed and dangerous.
If he resists...
...you're authorized to use lethal force.
I repeat, Briareos is still on the run.
I'll always protect you,
even if the world comes to an end.
- I need your help.
- You're gonna go after him, aren't you?
When you find him, use these.
What are they?
Parasite antitoxins.
They were developed during the war as
a countermeasure against cyber-terrorism.
It's like shock treatment for cyborgs.
It should help him regain consciousness.
If he starts to lose it,
shoot this into his nervous system...
...from the back of his neck,
if you can get it there.
So this can save him?
It's just an emergency measure,
but it's better than nothing.
Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.
Good luck.
Briareos.
I knew you'd come here.
You know every move I'm
gonna make, don't you?
I'm taking you in, Briareos.
Don't come any closer.
I can't control myself.
Briareos!
Who are you?
Why is there another one of me?
Why do you have what I've lost?
Everything will unite...
Get out of my head!
Deunan.
Briareos!
Tereus, hold him down.
Briareos.
It's no use, Deunan.
We have to...
Shut up and hold him.
I'm not giving up on you.
Open your eyes!
Briareos.
Briareos.
Briareos.
Deunan?
It's me, I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm always here.
I have to take him in, Deunan.
Tereus...
It's too late.
What is going on?
I'm registering riot codes everywhere.
Multiple signals.
Riots are breaking out across Olympus.
We've lost communication
with the other countries.
Unidentified data frequencies confirmed.
It's being broadcast from the satellites.
Everywhere?
This is happening all over the world.
It's war. This is how the war begins.
ES.W.A.T. Will work in conjunction
with the police to suppress the riots.
But remember, they're not terrorists,
just ordinary civilians being manipulated.
No excessive force unless you have to.
But don't forget
these riots must be stopped.
By any means necessary.
Stop walking. Just stop.
Son of a bitch! How's this happening?
Everyone who's hooked into Connexus
is being controlled...
...is that what you're telling me?
What do we do?
- This way!
- This is getting bad.
- I've got signals everywhere.
- We have to destroy the source.
"Halcon," that's what Kestner called it.
Poseidon is behind all this...
...and they're hiding something.
Poseidon's ship and their emissary
have already left, but they can't be far.
Let's go, we can do it.
Tereus, come in.
Have you located Briareos?
I repeat, have you located Briareos?
Report your status.
This is Tereus.
Briareos is...
He's dead, sir.
I repeat, Briareos is dead.
No need to send backup.
And thanks to you two,
I just told my first lie.
All right, let's go. I mean, l...
I can't go back to the station now, can I?
I guess not.
Move it. They don't fly themselves.
Mob numbers
are in the hundreds of thousands.
My readings say
they're heading towards Tartaros.
Hold your positions!
Avoid deadly force if at all possible!
That's it.
We're in a hurry.
No time for introductions.
I know why you're here.
We need to know two things:
What is Halcon
and where can we find it?
Halcon is no more.
But once it was Poseidon's
leading research and development lab.
Professor Elizabeth Xander
was the head of research.
They designed and developed
rehabilitation devices...
...for those who had sustained
severe head trauma in the war.
Using artificial intelligence
and cyborg technologies...
...they saved hundreds of the wounded.
Almost like a god...
Their pride led them to develop
a distorted sense of reality.
Did Halcon Laboratories
invent the Connexus?
Most likely.
They were obsessed with mind control.
We shut them down immediately.
Everyone was fired.
Soon thereafter...
Elizabeth Xander died in an accident.
That doesn't exonerate you.
You silenced them to
protect the conglomerate.
And now this is the end result.
Tell me where Halcon is.
This is Halcon's zero-gravity plant.
We sold it ages ago.
It's been abandoned for years...
It's not far from here.
I'm going in.
I'm going to destroy
Halcon before it destroys me.
We have to reclaim control.
We can supply you with the latest
weapons and a small task force.
It's the least that we can do.
This is Arges.
He will take care of the rest.
We'll meet up at the location.
Let's go.
A human, a bioroid and a cyborg.
The fate of Olympus
rests in their hands.
How does it look?
It's a prototype, but I should be fine.
If we stop the Halcon signal,
are you going to be okay?
Let's hope so.
The target should be in sight soon.
All Landmates, prepare for takeoff.
So this is Halcon.
It's a hell of a lot bigger than I imagined.
Halcon's main computer should
be located in the central core.
Our unit will escort the
three Olympus Landmates.
There's no way to know what's
inside, but we must stop it. Understood?
Luckily, there should be nobody inside.
Use your weapons freely!
It's moving.
Watch out!
Move to the right!
What the hell?
Incoming!
Central core coming up
after we get through this corridor.
Is this it?
That must be the core.
It's those drones again.
Get ready!
Don't stop moving!
Don't stand still!
Shit!
Briareos?
No!
Briareos!
Get away!
Briareos!
It's me!
Deunan.
You all right?
I'm all right. Thanks.
Another wave coming in.
Keep it tight, people.
Concentrate remaining forces
on reaching the target.
Tereus, I have one dose left...
...but I know my body.
My nerves can't handle another dose.
If I lose it again...
...I want you to take me out.
You understand?
Why do you ask me?
I need you to.
Briareos...
Incoming!
Maintain formation.
Cut straight through them.
What the hell have we got now?
Shit! He's quick!
The bullets aren't damaging him!
- Deunan, are you all right?
- Yeah!
There's another one.
Over there.
Come on, guys.
- Let's get him.
- We'll distract the drones.
- Take him out.
- No problem.
Move it, Deunan.
- Watch your back.
- You watch yours.
Out of bullets.
Where is he?
Is that all you've got?
Take this!
These guys are insane.
The central gate!
It's closing!
I got it.
Tereus, take care of Deunan.
One step ahead of you.
Move it.
- Deunan.
- Tereus.
Gotcha.
Tereus, hurry.
- We're gonna eject, then we jump through.
- Do it.
Stay back! I said stay back!
What cannot become one
will be eliminated.
Stop it!
Daddy? Daddy, get up.
Daddy! Daddy!
Section E commander, come in.
The security cameras
have been destroyed.
We can't seem to contact
Section S, either.
All monitoring systems
in Olympus have been lost.
This is your captain.
All ES.W.A.T. Troops, report your status.
Come in. Come in.
What is happening to Olympus?
It's Xander.
Kestner brought her back to life.
Briareos!
Deunan.
Go ahead and shoot.
Just be aware that if you kill me...
...all of the ones who have merged
with Halcon will be lost forever.
That, of course, will include
this Hecatonchire as well.
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna stop this thing?
That would be impossible.
Surrender yourselves now
and become one with Halcon.
Deunan.
Briareos. Answer me!
Briareos!
Is this it?
Briareos?
Part of Xander is still human.
You must find her consciousness.
Deunan!
Somebody...
Help me...
Forcing everybody's
consciousness together...
...doesn't create anything whole!
Deunan...
...use this.
Do it, Deunan!
I see that you wish to die.
Tereus!
Xander, we were both artificially created.
But our hearts...
Our souls are not artificial.
Can you hear me, Xander?
Wake up!
Deunan.
I've reset Halcon's signals.
Xander, you're conscious!
Deunan, destroy me while you still can.
It's the only way
to stop the Halcon system.
Destroy me before...
...Kestner's machine
takes control of me...
...again.
Deunan, shoot her!
Xander...
Now I can die as a human.
Thank you.
I'm so...
...so sorry.
This is Sector J-4.
The rioters have all started collapsing
en masse.
They've just stopped moving.
The unidentified data frequency
has stopped transmission.
The satellites are back online.
The rioters appear to be collapsing.
What the hell's going on?
Is it over?
Briareos! Are you all right?
I'm okay, Deunan.
You're sure, right?
Kestner's plan failed. It's over.
Tereus!
This is gonna hurt.
Let's hurry!
Where's Arges?
It's falling apart!
Tereus!
Just leave me here.
Shut up and get up!
We aren't leaving you behind!
I'm just a bioroid.
- They can make another one.
- That's not true!
We're not gonna leave you, Tereus.
No one can replace you.
Right?
Arges!
Let's go! Hurry!
Let's go, Tereus!
Come on!
Jump for it!
Let's get out of here!
We're back to the drawing board.
That's true.
But all that matters is
that we have survived.
We will forge ahead.
We can never give up.
Hope is not lost.
Thank you...
...Deunan.
I'll always protect you,
even if the world comes to an end.
Now, where have I heard that before?
You remembered.
How could I forget?
You gonna fight for her?
No, I'll find someone.
Someone whom I wish to protect.
Time to get you guys back to Olympus.
