Zurich in the year 1938.
Seven years before the end of WW2
began the story of a song
that conquered the world.
"Lili Marleen" would become
as famous as "Silent Night",
as famous as any song ever written.
Do you know how late it is?
7 o'clock.
Are you hungry too?
I'm always hungry.
We haven't eaten in ages.
Expecting anyone?
Only the bailiff.
Who is it?
A visitor for the gentleman.
It's Aaron.
Thanks, Mrs Buerli.
You're welcome.
Are you well?
As you can see.
Your father is looking for you.
After just one night?
Three nights.
Can we talk in private?
Sure.
Excuse me for a moment.
Two in Augsburg and one in Munich.
Learn them by heart.
Excuse me...
All right.  Do you understand?
Can you help me?
Every time that guy appears
you change completely.
I have to go away, Willie.
Where to?
Here are a few new passports, David.
Good work, Ernst.
Thanks, David.
- Tamara!
- Yes, dear.
Please be so kind and
bring us another sherry.
Have you heard from Robert?
Not yet.
Aaron is still on the phone.
We'll wait until 10.
If we haven't heard anything then,
we'll have to act.
Any news?
No.
That's not the ring we agreed on.
Shall I answer?
No, I'll go.
You?
Robert told me I could come
in an emergency.
When did he say that?
Before he left for Germany.
Please wait a moment.
What can I do for you?
Are you a friend of Robert's?
I'm his father.
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
My name is...
Robert calls me Willie.
Excuse me, we haven't met.
Robert knows very well
I don't want to meet you.
He was due back two days ago.
I'm worried about him.
Why are you worried?
I don't know.
I just have a funny feeling.
Did he tell you
what he's doing in Germany?
No.
I can't understand
why you're worried.
Then I'll leave now.
Good night.
Robert, there you are.
I'm sorry it didn't work out yesterday.
They arrested Koritovski.
We have to be very careful.
Have you got the documents?
Yes, they're in my briefcase.
I'm leaving.  First I'll go to Fulda,
then in September to Berlin.
Your address?
I'll write.
Good luck, Werner.
Thanks.
Say hello to your father.
I admire him. I owe him a lot.
Because he made it possible
for you to study?
That's no reason to admire him.
He's got plenty of money.
What a beautiful woman.
Such a sensuous mouth.
And she sings very well.
Excuse me, you wanted to talk to me?
Thanks for coming. Please sit down.
- You're German, aren't you?
- Yes.
So why are you singing in Switzerland?
I think Switzerland is a good stepping-stone,
especially as it's international.
Do you really think
Switzerland is international?
At the moment, yes.
Because of all the riff-raff here?
What do you mean by riff-raff?
I mean refugees, Jews, intellectuals, gypsies...
Shall we dance?
Zurich is really provincial.
Extremely boring.
Berlin, on the other hand,
is completely different.
It's the right city for an artist.
Germany is where you'll get ahead.
You're an artist?
What do you think?
My love is the theatre.
Ah, you're a director?
You're really talented.
If you were in Germany
I could do a lot for you.
124... that's my room number
in the Grand Hotel Dolder.
I don't even know your name.
Hans... Henkel.
I have lots of friends here in Zurich.
It wouldn't hurt having a friend in Berlin.
I could fit Berlin into my next European tour.
But I have to get back on stage now.
It's 120,000 marks in notes,
and gems worth half a million.
I'll take it to the bank
first thing tomorrow morning.
How did she get into your flat?
She's got a key.
- Tell me, where did that come from?
- Listen, Willie...
Robert, I think you owe me
an explanation.
Watch what you say.
I don't like your tone,
and besides, it's my business.
Not exactly.
I've made a promise to her.
What have you promised?
I said I would explain everything
once I got back.
And now I'm back.
What exactly did you tell her?
First, that I help
endangered Jews to escape
with forged papers.
And second, that I also smuggle
Jewish assets out of Germany.
She'll tell the Gestapo!
Why are you all against her?
She hasn't done anything wrong.
Or do you dislike her because she's German?
That's enough to make me suspicious.
Of course, you're prejudiced.
- Admit it.
- You ask a lot of us.
What, for example?
That we passively watch this girl
endanger our work.
She won't be a danger.
How do you know?
Because I'm going to marry her.
Robert, listen carefully.
No one here holds anything against her.
You just met each other
at the wrong time, that's all.
- Hello, Viktor.
- Hello, Willie.
Is that him playing?
Yes, that's him.
Yes, I know why.
We're getting married.
And what will we live on?
On your talent for debt.
That should do for a start.
Doesn't it make you happy?
I need a handkerchief.
You're impossible.
But before we go to the registry office
I want to eat. I'm dying of hunger.
I've already eaten... with your father.
He invited me.
My father?
At first I thought he didn't like me.
But now I know him better
I think he's nice.
- You don't need to defend him.
- I'm not.
My father's a pessimist.
He's sure there'll be a war.
We didn't talk about politics.
What did you talk about?
About you...
Your next trip to Munich.
I told him that I'll join you.
You'll have nothing to do with it.
It's much too dangerous.
It'll be more dangerous
if you go alone.
My father would never agree to that.
Oh yes, I convinced him.
I told him
you needed a good luck charm.
After all, I'm German...
and on the top of that,
Aryan back to the Stone Age.
And from there on
persuading him was simple.
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
Please come in, I didn't expect you
after all that's happened.
What's happened?
Haven't you seen?
We just arrived.
Last night almost all Jewish
shops were wrecked.
The synagogue was torched
and destroyed.
It looked horrible in town,
pieces of glass everywhere...
May I ask who you are?
This is my fianc√©e.
I'm so sorry but we have to be careful.
My father sends his regards.
Thanks. Do you have something for me?
It's really good.
I have something else for you...
if you want to risk it.
I have my guardian angel with me.
Bernt!
Bernt, bring me the samples.
This is Bernt, my son.
Please excuse the disguise,
but it's necessary for us.
So all in all, it's 120,000.
- Have you memorised it?
- I think so.
You should leave immediately.
Bernt will accompany you.
Please get out of the car.
- You can go. Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Miss Bunterberg?
- Yes.
Please come with me.
Give me the papers.
There's an expulsion order here
in your name.
I'm sorry, but you're
not allowed to enter Switzerland.
An expulsion order?
- That's impossible.
- We have been told...
you've run up debts here in Switzerland.
The authorities have declared you
persona non grata.
You're Swiss, so you know we
take debts very seriously.
I must ask you to return to Germany.
We'd better do as he says.
It's only one hundred metres.
I'll go to a lawyer tomorrow.
You'll be back in Zurich tomorrow night.
I'm so worried.
About what?
All right, let's check our watches.
It's exactly 11:23.
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock sharp
I'll be here again on this spot.
Good night, Robert.
Good night, Willie.
See you tomorrow.
4 o'clock sharp.
On the dot.
I knew straight away you were behind this.
You've always been cunning.
You persuaded me
to take Willie to Germany.
Then you bought up all her debts
and reported her to the authorities.
How much did it cost you?
One day you'll realise
it was the only solution.
You're playing with people's lives.
Give me the IOUs.
I'll give them to you,
but first you have to
come to your senses.
You cheat, you liar, you scoundrel!
Don't you know how late it is?
What happened?
Listen, Willie,
I need a few more days.
You know how it is
with the authorities.
I must try to get the money together.
6,800 francs.
6,800 francs?
Robert, I don't owe that much.
You do, if you add it all together.
Please tell me the truth.
But that is the truth.
Come on, don't be worried.
I'll manage. Trust me.
First I'll contact the Lederers in Munich.
Robert, I'm not as tough as you.
You don't need to be.
I'm just asking you for...
one more smile.
There!
What's the matter?
Why is she crying?
It's the Swiss consulate.
They're refusing entry.
Without giving any reason.
Then she can just apply again.
No reason to despair.
The best thing would be
to look for a job.
Come in.
I must admit I never expected
to see you in Munich.
How did you know I was here?
It was in the newspaper.
I had no idea you were such a bigwig.
I'm sorry.
You look even more beautiful
than in Zurich.
Perhaps the change of air suits you.
I'm here
because I'm in a difficult situation.
I hope that you...
won't take advantage of it.
Theo, for you!
Yes, Prosel.
Who is it?
Oh, Mr Henkel...
I'm calling about a young female singer.
She's been performing recently in Zurich.
Listen, Prosel...
You have to meet her.
She's very talented.
She'd be just right for your place,
I think. Do you understand?
Is she Aryan?
Of course, otherwise
I wouldn't recommend her.
- Well?
- Great.
Recently somebody asked me why
we don't tell jokes on stage nowadays.
Ah, I said...
It's very tricky,
because good jokes are political.
We don't tell them in bars...
or we'll find ourselves
behind bars!
You know that here at the "Simpeltopf"
we sometimes take a few risks.
Tonight we have a newcomer for you
singing a song by a young composer
held in high regard
by our Fuhrer himself.
The text is by Hans Leip.
Do you know Leip?
It doesn't matter.
He wrote the words in 1916.
At the time he was in love
with two girls at the same time.
One was called Lili
and the other Marleen.
I can't hear.
Speak up.
I said louder!
Leip wrote it a while ago.
A lot has changed in Germany since then.
But what matters...
is that one reflects on the message,
the message about war.
How are you, my darling?
I'm missing you.
I'm missing you terribly!
Do you understand?
I'm missing you!
I'm missing you so much!
True, we have peace in the world.
Yes, really!
And our Fuhrer will know
how to avert it... the war.
How long will that take?
The problem is that a woman's fidelity
can only be really tested in wartime.
What, Beethoven?
That's fantastic.
I'll cross my fingers.
I'm also premiering tonight.
I like the song.
And now, may I have your attention
for a beautiful
and talented young woman.
I love you!
Only you!
Promise me you won't sleep with
any other women!
Okay, bye.
You're on. I hope
you haven't lost your voice.
In front of the barracks,
by the big gate,
Once there stood a street lamp,
and if it still stands today,
Then we'll see each other again,
At that street lamp
we will stand,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Our two shadows merged into one,
Our love was enduring
and plain to everyone...
She doesn't know how to sing.
And she's got bow-legs.
But the legs are better
than her voice.
That's for sure.
What's he going on about?
We're in Germany now, you bastard.
We'll talk when we like.
My god, you're crying.
It was awful.
They didn't like me.
That was my big chance.
Nonsense, of course they liked you.
It wasn't awful.
Don't make me laugh.
On the contrary,
that song has something.
It moves people deeply.
We'll record it on disc.
- Are you surprised?
- Well, yes... I...
Why are you stuttering?
You haven't got any reason.
Or maybe you do?
I don't want anything special,
I just want to work again.
You were always happy with me.
Yes, but your father...
You told me it has nothing to do with
my father, only with the organisation.
Which needs everyone it can get,
urgently!
So I'll do the next trip to Munich.
You just want
to see that woman again.
I love her...
and I need to know how she is.
I need to know
which side she's on.
Okay, the last verse once again
from the start, please.
But...
What? We do it right
or not at all.
Everyone here wants the best,
don't they?
Of course.
Especially the part
about the fog at dusk.
You put more feeling
in it before, Willie.
Isn't that right?
Yes, more feeling.
You're quite right.
Okay... rewind.
First you Taschner
and then you Willie.
And remember, more feeling.
Much more.
Of course.
You?
You must be out of your mind!
You're in danger here.
That big one over there, Henkel,
is a very brutal guy.
What is it this time?
You were doing fine.
My God, we've been at this
more than 18 hours!
It's already 6 in the morning.
We're all on edge,
including you, Willie.
I'm sorry, Mr Henkel,
but I don't fell well.
Maybe we should
rest for ten minutes.
I'll go out
to get some fresh air.
Turn on the radio.
The 6 o'clock news has started.
"Since 5:45 we've been returning fire..."
Despite all that, we'll finish this.
Take a break, Willie.
Where is he?
He's waiting outside.
Behind the tree. But hurry.
Be careful and don't put him in danger.
It's time for me too, Mother.
Take good care of yourself, Bernt.
Take good care.
You're crazy.
Crazy about you.
Robert, the war has just begun.
So what? Do you still love me?
Why do you ask?
Can't you feel it?
Yes, I feel it.
But I have to know for sure.
I need to know
which side you're on.
On your side.
As long as I'm alive
I'll stand with you.
But you can't always choose...
how to live, how to survive.
Willie, we have to finish.
We're late anyway.
Thanks, I'm fine.
Bernt, when do you
have to leave?
Tomorrow, I think.
Oh, I wanted to say so much.
You don't have to tell me anything.
You've been so good to me,
you and your mother.
Now you really have to come.
I'm coming.
All the best.
It's hard to believe
I have to come here to see my son.
I need to talk to you.
Shall we have a drink?
I don't drink while I'm working.
Why are you playing
in this sleazy bar?
I've got to earn money.
6800 francs
is no small sum of money.
Did you want to talk about that?
It's Mother's birthday tomorrow.
I know.
You also know how much it would
hurt her if you don't come.
I beg you, come.
To your health. And thank you
for coming all this way.
Take care.
Your son just arrived.
Ah, thank you very much, Miriam.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Aaron...  Robert?
Thanks, Robert.
- Happy?
- I just said thanks.
- Where is Mother?
- She'll be here soon.
Come, let me introduce you
to my old friend.
This is Robert, an immensely
complicated and difficult son.
Dr Glaubrecht,
and his daughter Miriam.
You two actually know each other.
Yes, I recall
what nappies she wore.
You were charming.
Surely not, she was a difficult child.
Hard to cope with.
Fathers always have to
criticise their children.
Not always.
At this moment
I'm very satisfied with him.
Got a cigarette?
If we continue like this
we'll be history soon.
The disc isn't selling well.
The song isn't bad, but in these bad times
people want amusing things.
We need something funny.
What do you mean, funny?
Funny is anything
that doesn't remind you of dying.
Besides, you sing too slow.
You play too fast.
We need a new repertoire.
That damn card again.
I get the feeling we're starting
we get on each other's nerves.
We need to become popular.
Once we're famous
everything will be much easier.
I don't want to die in this war.
Let's form an ensemble.
They won't split us up then
and I can stay civilian
until this shit is over.
It's okay with me
if it's what you want.
But of course
you'll have to play more slowly.
"The Wehrmacht have announced
that Belgrade has been taken..."
Belgrade...
This is Armed Forces Radio in Belgrade.
Welcome to our listeners.
Let me see what we have today...
Marie Luise in Pensberg
sends her regards to
Corporal Manfred in Narvik.
Captain Hans Gunther in Benghazi...
love from your mother
in Castrop-Rauxel.
Lieutenant Reintgen...
I'm sorry, Colonel,
but this is all we have.
We've only got 54 discs
and we're broadcasting 24 hours.
We do our best, Colonel, but...
Are you mad?
Can't you see we're on air?
Corporal Lederer reporting back.
Mission accomplished.
Where did you steal those?
We borrowed them from
Radio Vienna.
Are you kidding me?
You drive 1000 km and bring discs from
banned composers... Offenbach, Kalman...
That's not all.
Put this one on.
But be careful, it's a rarity.
"Song of a young sentry...
Lili Marleen."
And now Radio Belgrade has a special
treat, a young sentry¬ís song...
"Lili Marleen."
Your parents have arrived.
Did you enjoy the play?
Yes. Good evening, Miriam.
Everyone's waiting for the official
announcement of your engagement.
Yes, all of Zurich is waiting.
From this quiet place
deep beneath the earth,
Your loving lips lift me
as if I'm in a dream,
When the fog of dusk
whirls around
I'll stand again
by the street lamp,
Like before, Lili Marleen,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Read this.
Thank God you're back.
The postman almost collapsed.
A few more bags are waiting
for you at the post office.
They don't know
what to do with them.
"Lili Marleen..."
Do you understand this?
It was in the cards.
I knew all along
that card meant something.
I must make a call.
Have you got a phone?
Yes.
My son has gone crazy.
He wants your autograph.
Reich Culture Ministry, Strehlow.
I'm sure it's all harmless.
Can't you be quiet for once?
Willie, you're just nervous.
Shut up!
You're completely over-reacting...
Believe me,
there's nothing behind it.
Wait, please.
Oh, here you are, Willie.
You're expected.
I'm sorry,
but could you stay here?
I'm happy that I managed
to surprise you.
You certainly surprised me, Mr Henkel.
I hope you weren't worried
about anything?
No, of course not, why would I?
But it sounds somehow impressive...
"Reich Culture Ministry".
If you're suddenly asked
to appear here, you understand...
Not exactly.
But you'll find it's not
half as bad as many people think.
But now to us...
I'm glad to see you again.
I can personally congratulate you
on your success.
I know that you're very talented.
After all, I discovered you.
We have to celebrate this.
What are your plans for Saturday?
A show at Army Headquarters.
What about Sunday?
Dinner with General Baerwald.
Is there any chance
if I suggest another time?
You once recommended I have
friends in Berlin. Now I have them.
It's quite normal for a popular singer
to have a lot of engagements.
I've been lucky
for the first time in my life.
Now I'll do everything
to hold on to it.
Yes, I hope you'll succeed.
Should you ever get into trouble
you know where to find me.
Trouble?
What sort of trouble?
I thought you knew.
Really?
But you surely know
over 6 million of our soldiers
listen every evening
to Radio Belgrade.
6 million?
No!
Really, I can't believe it.
It's true.
Every night from the North Cape to Africa,
regardless of combat conditions,
soldiers sit for three minutes
in front of the radio.
6 million?
Yes, but there's one thing
you don't know.
There are some people
suggesting your song be banned.
They say Lili Marleen is not in the spirit
of the national socialist cause.
But it's only...
It's just a song.
Some songs encourage people
and spur them on.
Others don't suit our purposes so well.
Especially if they're a bit morbid.
Didn't you ever notice?
I'll tell you
what Dr Goebbels called your song.
A tearjerker stinking of death.
It's not easy to change his mind.
That's what I meant by "trouble".
Could that maybe change if...
I cancelled the dinner with
General Baerwald?
Where did you get that idea?
I can't see any connection.
It was a pleasure to see you again.
Enter.
Something important?
I think so.
Then we have to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr Henkel.
You can leave through this door.
Now Strehlow,
what's of such importance?
The Reich chancellery...
The Fuhrer wants to meet Lili Marleen.
Are you kidding me, Strehlow?
As soon as possible.
That means tomorrow for tea.
Hitler and Goebbels always had
different tastes in music...
and women.
I haven't got a clue how to address him.
I can't possibly just say "Heil Hitler".
You lift the right arm
and say "Heil Mein Fuhrer".
"Heil Mein Fuhrer",
"Heil Mein Fuhrer"...
I'm Robert Hoffman.
Born on 11 April 1907.
In Leipzig.
Leipzig... I'm a piano teacher.
Mother is Josephine Brandner
and father is Ernst Georg.
Mother, Josephine Brandner.
Father, Ernst Georg.
I went to grammar school
in Ingolstadt...
What's the matter?
Nothing. I'm just asking myself
if we're making a mistake.
Why, what's the matter?
I like how I look.
However you look, Robert,
I love you.
Why him?
Why can't somebody else go?
Because he knows Berlin very well.
And he's got the strongest nerves.
What about my nerves?
All right, what do we toast to?
To August 4th...
the day of my return.
I hope it's to your liking.
So much white is unusual,
but you like this colour.
The Fuhrer would be happy
if you accept this little gift.
Really, I don't understand...
I wouldn't think too much about it.
How did you know that I like white?
The things we need to know, we know.
Bravo! My lovely cards!
Everyone should see and hear
We're doing thriving business here,
With you, Lili Marleen.
Heil to you, Lili Marleen.
We made it.
Lili Marleen, we're at the top.
Up, all the way up.
Above the clouds.
...with you, Lili Marleen.
Now I'll tell you a secret.
I'm a terrible musician
and you can't sing at all.
Oh, is that how you see things?
You're insane.
Silly...
You're crazy!
Cheers to your overpriced voice.
You look beautiful tonight.
Just tonight?
I can't always flatter you
Do you have her number?
It's not in the phone book,
and I won't give it to you.
In case you fall into a trap.
I need to know the truth.
I can tell you this.
She dates the highest Nazi officials.
She doesn't need ration cards.
She's got all the privileges.
She's part of high society.
And she obviously enjoys it...
to the full.
I'm sorry, Robert.
We all make mistakes.
That's true.
This song is an iron link between
the soldiers at the front
and their loved ones at home.
In front of the barracks,
by the big gate,
Once there stood a street lamp,
and if it still stands today,
Then we'll see each other again,
At the street lamp we will stand,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Our two shadows merged into one,
Our love was enduring
and clear to everyone.
So all the people will see again
When we return to the street lamp,
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Like before, Lili Marleen.
Then the post horn
blew the curfew.
"It could cost you three days."
"Comrade, I'll come soon!"
That was when we said goodbye,
Though I wish
I could have stayed with you,
With you, Lili Marleen.
With you, Lili Marleen.
She knows your footsteps,
your own determined walk.
Every night she dreams that
you won't forget her hand.
And if anything bad
should happen to me,
Who will stand at the street lamp?
With you, Lili Marleen.
With you, Lili Marleen.
- Regards from Robert.
- Where is he?
Can I have an autograph?
Lili! Lili! There she is.
Move away.
We want to take some pictures.
Please move back.
We've been
looking for you everywhere.
The group-leader invited us to the Adlon.
He wants to celebrate your success.
I'm not feeling well.
Does that mean
you turn me down again?
I'll get you an aspirin.
I feel miserable.
I have a bad headache.
I'm sorry.
My chauffeur can take you home.
It's not necessary. I think I'll walk.
The fresh air will do me good.
I'll be fine. Good night.
I know her, she's so stubborn.
Follow her.
Yes, group-leader.
Lights off!
This is Blonsky.
I'm in Oswald Spengler Street.
I repeat, Oswald Spengler Street.
Send a second man.
Are you crazy? I know you take
big risks, but this is madness.
You have to go.
Immediately!
Why should I leave?
You're in danger, darling.
Of your life!
In your position
you can surely protect me.
Me?
What gave you that idea?
It's obvious.
In some ways
you're a figurehead of this regime.
What?  My God!
I'm just singing a song.
Your song, that's all.
But you have friends.
Very influential friends, I'm told.
At the top of the Nazi hierarchy.
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
You ask me that?
Yes, Robert, I'm asking you.
Maybe you should ask yourself.
All right.  They're just acquaintances.
Not friends.
In my position
it happens automatically.
I can't always reject them
or I'll be suspected.
But you like it.
You enjoy the privileges.
In some ways, yes.
And you can ignore
the terrible things that are happening?
Germany is at war.
There have always been wars.
I'm not talking about your war.
Unimaginable atrocities
are happening.
I don't know
anything about it, Robert.
I'm just singing a song.
Finally!
I thought I'd be here all night alone.
I'm a Jew.
I knew that before.
But you Germans
have been ordered to despise us.
I love you as you are.
I've missed you so much.
An eternity...
What will happen to us?
- Your papers, please.
- Gestapo.
I must say, first class work.
Except one small thing
not visible to the naked eye.
Who are you?
My name is Robert Hoffmann.
I didn't ask
under which name you're travelling.
I asked who you really are.
All right.
I'm Robert Hoffmann.
Okay, let's assume
you are Robert Hoffmann.
What are you doing here in Berlin?
I'm passing through.
You spent one night
at the Pension Jakobeit.
That's right.
No, two nights. And one night
you had a visitor, a lady.
Yes, from time to time
I have female visitors.
The lady I'm talking about
is quite famous.
I don't know
which lady you mean.
Normally she doesn't go to bed
with any Tom, Dick or Hoffmann.
She prefers the higher ranks,
those at the very top.
Why are you telling me all this?
Miriam, I still haven't had any news.
Aaron will be here soon.
A drink?
No thanks, not just now.
This arrived from Drewitz
via Amsterdam.
Robert had nothing on him
when they caught him...
but of course it's just a matter of time
before they find out his true identity.
Was he with her?
She went to see him.
I thought it was over.
It was years ago.
Blonsky here.
Woman entered a black
Mercedes, 1936 model.
Robert was arrested yesterday
shortly after he left you.
- Robert? My god... Gestapo?
- Yes.
You don't think that I...
Put yourself in my place.
Your relationship proves nothing.
So why are you here?
Hurry please,
I want to get out.
Maybe because...
I would like Robert to be right.
Why did you stop?
I'm waiting for the leader
of our resistance group.
He thinks this meeting is necessary.
Hello Drewitz,
I'm glad to meet you.
- But the meeting is an enormous risk.
- For all of us.
But because Robert Mendelsson
trusts you, I trust you too.
Have you heard of
Treblinka, Auschwitz, Majdanek?
What?
We need evidence about
what's happening in Poland
in the concentration camps
and ghettos.
And you could get this evidence.
How?
You do performances at the front.
Private journeys to Poland
are forbidden.
I still don't see
what I could do there for you.
You could say you want to
entertain at the Eastern front.
Nobody would deny you.
On the contrary.
Would that help Robert?
I can't promise you that.
But you would help our cause a lot.
I'd like to know who you are.
You can stop. We've arrived.
Please tell me who you are.
My name is Gunther Weissenbaum.
I'm sorry, we still don't know.
We know only one thing.
He isn't Robert Hoffmann.
Robert Hoffmann died
three years ago.
In a car accident.
There's only one way to find out.
Through the girl.
But we need permission
from the top.
Of course I'll keep you posted.
Soldiers!
Friends!
This is a very happy day.
Today we celebrate the birthday
of the man always in our thoughts,
the man who will guide
our people to the final victory.
Our beloved Fuhrer
and chancellor, Adolf Hitler.
Three times "Sieg Heil"!
Tell her to come back on!
Get her back!
Where has she gone?
Do you know where Willie is?
No idea.
He asks if you realise the danger
if the film is found on you.
Yes.
He says you seem a bit...
a bit nervous.
He says you look frightened.
But at the moment
you're our only hope.
We wish you all the luck
in the world.
Look for a safe hiding place,
and if everything works out,
give Gunther Weissenbaum
our best wishes.
Stop! It's driving me mad!
Stop it!
Willie is involved in something,
she hid something down her dress.
Your attention, please.
We're happy to welcome among us...
our Lili Marleen!
May I ask
why you only join us now?
I didn't feel comfortable.
Headache again?
No, it's okay now.
We've missed you.
Not too much, I hope.
It's ladies' choice now, boys!
- Come on boys, ladies' choice!
- Get out of my way!
Your room is over there,
group-leader.
I have to talk with your partner.
Do you understand?
Willie is not only my partner,
she's my fianc√©e.
And if anyone touches
her breasts, it's me.
You've got some nerve, Taschner.
But unfortunately this is
the wrong place to show it.
You'll get a chance to prove your
courage where it's most needed.
Why didn't you shut up?
Was that really necessary?
A medical inspection?
Is the doctor sexy?
Thank you, next please.
What the devil is this for?
It's a physical inspection.
I'm vaccinated against
smallpox and typhus.
Complain to the group-leader.
Please fall in line.
What?
May I enter?
Give me the film.
You can trust me.
Join the queue!
Are you just putting up with this?
You usually put up a fight.
Nothing.
This is the photo
from our contact in Zurich.
What's the name?
Mendelsson.
Very interesting.
Okay, leave it to me.
Group-leader...
You will return to Berlin tomorrow.
They're expecting you.
Does that mean
my tour has finished?
We would have liked
to keep you longer.
But some things
are more important.
What do you mean,
some things are more important?
I was asked to send you
to Berlin without delay.
As far as I'm concerned...
that's as good as an order.
By the way, your piano player
Mr Taschner is leaving too.
His services are required
at the Eastern front.
She vehemently denies
having maintained
a relationship with
the Jew Mendelsson.
But she admits spending
the night in question with a man.
But she doesn't want to
give the name
as he's a high-ranking person
in the Reich.
She thinks it isn't appropriate
to disclose his identity.
Is that correct?
Then sign here, please.
Thank you very much.
Just wait a moment.
I think that concludes the matter.
I'll be back soon.
Allow me.
You somehow look familiar.
You probably saw me
in the newspapers.
Probably.
Would you like a cigarette?
Ah, I remember.
You're Lili Marleen.
I sing "Lili Marleen",
to be precise.
Sorry.
What do you think?
It doesn't look like
they know each other.
You're in very good company there.
Even the Fuhrer was fooled by her.
Congratulations, you would have
made a great actress.
That was a superb performance!
Blonsky, take Mr Mendelsson
back to his cell.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Come on, Mendelsson.
You can leave too.
I don't need you anymore.
By the way, from today
"Lili Marleen" is blacklisted.
You can be thankful
you're so popular.
Kaufmann,
get me our man in Zurich.
Now I'm in for it, after all.
Do you know where you're being sent?
To the east.
Maybe to search for mines.
Pianists are useful there
because of the sensitive fingers.
Promise me one thing, Heinz...
that you won't play the hero.
Now you don't have
anybody to protect you.
You too, Willie.
One way or another...
we'll make it.
Of course we will.
My cards, can you believe
I forgot my cards!
I'll send them to you.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Hey Bernt, Bernt!
My God, what are you doing here?
I was wounded,
now I have to go again.
- But...
- It was nothing.
- Good day, Mr Taschner!
- Hello, Bernt.
You two should
take care of each other.
We will.
I have to go now.
Take care of yourself.
You too, Heinz.
- You too, Bernt.
- Sure, Willie.
But I have to go now.
Yes, that's her.
Stop singing that song!
That song is forbidden.
Don't sing that song.
That song is forbidden.
Stop singing it.
I'd love to blow up
the whole bunch.
We'll only kill them as a last resort.
Do you understand?
On my list I have 78 people.
I only see 4.
Where are the others?
We don't believe
in squandering people.
And I don't see my son.
You will, when the deal is done.
Here's the film.
You can keep it. Don't underestimate us.
Don't think we're stupid.
You can make copies of films,
but not of people.
I'll make you a counter-offer.
We meet here at regular intervals.
You and your friends make sure
this film stays secret.
We meet again in six months.
In three months, with 100 people.
Don't be so greedy. More than six
is out of the question.
Every three months is okay.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Where is my son?
The first group can come now.
That's settled, then.
Now the other group.
- Let me blow them up.
- No!
Cover!
Why did you do that?
I hate deals.
Did you meet Willie?
No, she's being watched
by the Gestapo.
She tried to commit suicide
and they arrested her.
So let's try to get ahead of them.
Please send this today to Zurich.
- Saying she's dead?
- Yes, we must force them to deny it.
It's the only way, Drewitz.
We just received this from Drewitz.
How does that concern us?
Can I see?
Weissenbaum is right.
This is the only way
to do something for her.
If we want to
do something for her.
By the way, in two hours a Red
Cross plane leaves for London.
But why should we suddenly
help this woman?
I haven't told you
everything, Robert.
I knew that she smuggled
the film out of Poland.
But this is terrible, Father.
It's cruel. If Robert had known
he wouldn't have married me.
I don't think so, Miriam.
But I apologise.
I'm truly sorry. But I thought
it would be for the best.
For you...
and for all of us.
If you want to catch the plane
you must leave now.
Goodbye, Miriam.
- You can't go in. They're broadcasting.
- Let me pass!
Let me through!
This is Robert Mendelsson
calling all German soldiers.
I've just heard that the woman
who made "Lili Marleen" famous
has been killed
in a concentration camp.
- Her song has been banned.
- Switch on my mike.
This is Radio Calais
calling all German soldiers.
Wherever you are,
you will still be able to
listen to "Lili Marleen".
If not on Radio Belgrade then
via the Free Radio Calais.
Yes Minister, I heard it.
Yes, it was most unexpected.
Yes, very unpleasant,
I fully agree.
Yes, of course
we have to do something.
Yes, I'll keep you up to date.
She's still very weak.
I took the liberty...
I have a message for you.
A personal greeting from Dr Goebbels.
He's asking about your condition.
We were all very concerned.
You gave us quite a shock.
Please tell the press
what we agreed on before.
We're all wondering
why you asked us to come here.
We asked you to come here
to tell the world
once and for all
that Jewish propaganda is pure lies.
They had no scruples
about using one of the most famous
and beloved German singers
for their smear campaign.
Radio London and Radio Calais
spread the infamous lie
that the singer of "Lili Marleen"
was murdered in a camp.
This is your chance to show loyalty
to the great German Reich...
and the Fuhrer.
That's all we ask of you.
And if I don't?
You don't want us to confirm
the news from the BBC... do you?
The time when you could
threaten me is over,
when I couldn't fall asleep
because I was afraid to wake up.
I'm not afraid anymore,
can't you see?
This might interest you.
A week ago we deported your friend
Robert Mendelsson to Switzerland.
Robert is in Switzerland?
I knew that would
make you feel better.
I don't believe you.
Put the call through.
Please see for yourself.
It's Willie.
Robert... it's for you.
Robert, your voice...
You're alive.
I'm fine.
Really.
What do you want me to do?
You have to sing tonight.
That's out of the question.
It's an order from the top!
She must look better than ever.
Make the light as soft as possible.
Excuse me, Mr Henkel,
can I ask you a few questions?
When will the show begin?
The usual time, 3 minutes to 10.
Gentlemen, you'd best take your seats.
- I'd better go too.
- Yes.
This is Radio Berlin
joined by stations across Germany.
For the 211th time
from the packed Berlin arena
we present a request concert
for the Wehrmacht.
And here she is,
for friend and foe alike,
as always at this time
every night... Lili Marleen!
- Did you hear that?
- It must be our people.
Follow me!
Russians!
We announce
the unconditional surrender
of all our armed forces
on land, by sea and by air,
including all remaining forces
under German command,
facing the Red Army High Command
and the Supreme Command
of the Allied expeditionary force.
How much longer, my God,
how much longer?
What?
What did you say?
How much longer
do we have to hide?
We need to explain things
to the military command.
And who knows if they'll believe us.
Weissenbaum could testify for us...
but it'll be a long time
before anyone will believe us.
Do you know, Willie,
that a murder took place here?
No, when did that happen?
I think 1928 or 1929.
Before the Nazis took power.
A pimp killed his girl here.
It's a very mysterious story.
Where did that happen?
In the front of the fallen tree.
The case was used
in a novel at that time.
Tell me more.
I don't know any more.
I haven't read it.
I just heard about it.
Do you still love me?
In my way.
What do you mean?
That's the way it is.
May I kiss you?
Just once more, please.
Why do you say that?
I think... you should go to him.
To Robert.  In Zurich.
Willie, you're back!
Nice to see you.
Is that him?
Yes, it's Robert. I always knew
he would become famous one day.
Yes, I remember how he started.
It was great.
Just fantastic.
I think you ought to take another bow.
You needn't say who you are.
I've always wanted to meet you.
I am Miriam Mendelsson.
- Where's Willie?
- She left.
- It was brilliant.
- Quite wonderful...
The audience is calling for you.
Willie, where are you going?
