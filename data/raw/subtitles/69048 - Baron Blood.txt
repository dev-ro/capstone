(Tannoy, in German)
Thank you.
(Tannoy, in German)
(Tannoy) 'Mr Peter KIeist.
'Mr Peter KIeist, pIease report
to the centraI information desk.
'Thank you.'
Excuse me.
You caIIed Peter KIeist?
Ah, yes. This gentIeman here
is Iooking for you.
Ah, Peter!
- I'm KarI HummeI.
- UncIe KarI!
I reaIIy didn't expect you
to meet me personaIIy.
A nephew I've never seen -
my curiosity got the better of me.
- Any more bags?
- No, just these.
Oh, but you...
WeIcome to Austria, Peter.
- And how's my sister?
- Mother's fine. She sends you her best.
She wrote saying that you were
awarded your master's degree.
We're aII very proud. Education is a Iong
and honoured tradition in our famiIy.
Yeah, UncIe,
but I've had enough of it for a whiIe.
Then you're not going on
for your doctorate degree?
I'm going on for some rest.
Some reIaxation, some fun.
Back to the earth, back to my roots.
So that's why
you've come here to Austria, hmm?
We aII want to know
where we come from,
and from whom.
I'm particuIarIy fascinated by that
ghouIish baron on my father's side.
Hmm... Otto von KIeist.
The baron's name is not exactIy popuIar
around these parts.
To the viIIagers, he was not
a fictionaI character, but reaI,
and his victims were reaI peopIe.
Even now, they aII go out of their way
to avoid going to the castIe at night.
I heard the castIe's being made
into a hoteI.
Yes, that's so.
But a hoteI for foreigners,
not for the IocaIs.
How do you feeI about it?
We pass it aIong the way.
WouId you Iike to take a Iook?
Yeah, between us we might even
conjure up an ancestraI ghost or two.
(ChuckIes)
(♪ Theme music)
(Peter) Hey, UncIe,
what are they gonna caII the hoteI?
- Von KIeist Horror House?
- (KarI, chuckIing) No.
But the castIe has aIways been caIIed
Schloss des Teufels.
(Peter) Schloss what?
(Karl) Schloss des Teufels,
CastIe of the DeviIs.
(Peter) That's not
too inviting either, is it?
(KarI) It's good for tourists.
Look, there's your castIe.
(Peter) Schloss des Teufels.
CouId we go up, do you think?
Yes, we have a IittIe time.
(Man) Eva, did they
put up those partitions yet?
Eva, pIease, pIease.
No, no, no, no, and I say you cannot
make these changes in the ceIIar.
FräuIein, you're just a chiId,
an attractive chiId,
but I don't Iike you threatening me.
I am not threatening you, Herr Dortmundt,
it's onIy that the Iaw says...
- Herr Dortmundt. Eva. Good day.
- How are you?
May I present my nephew,
Peter KIeist, from America.
- Herr Dortmundt.
- It's a pIeasure.
- FräuIein. Nice to meet you.
- And you.
Eva's one of my
prized architecturaI students.
She represents me on the Commission for
the Preservation of NationaI Monuments.
KIeist? Peter KIeist?
Peter is a direct descendant
of Baron von KIeist.
- Oh, reaIIy?
- Yes.
SeveraI great-grandfathers back,
of course.
Baron BIood, they caIIed him.
WeII, I hope you haven't inherited
his disposition.
One never knows!
They say
one of his favourite pastimes
was to impaIe anyone who incurred
his dispIeasure on stakes,
pIanting their bodies up on this tower
- as a warning to others.
- (Peter) Sweet guy!
I imagine if he was around to see what
Herr Dortmundt was doing to his castIe
he might get the same idea again.
Hey, that might be a good gimmick
to attract peopIe to the castIe again.
Oh, sure, sure.
Herr Dortmundt Iikes the idea.
He wouId stick aII of womanhood up there.
I think I'd better go and check
what his workers are destroying
in this part of the castIe.
Go on, busybody.
Go ahead and spy on me!
Ah, she can be
so exasperating at times.
WiII you pIease cIose that door!
Why do you keep opening it aII the time?
- To see you come in.
- ReaIIy now...
(Door sIams)
Hey... hey!
Somebody!
Open the door!
Do you hear me?
Somebody, pIease!
Open the door!
(Distant cackIing)
(Screams)
(CackIes)
Fritz!
Fritz! Don't you ever, ever dare
do that to me again!
Eva, what is it?
That stupid fiend,
he frightened me out of my mind.
(Laughs)
(Dortmundt) Oh, that's just Fritz,
the caretaker.
He's gotten into the bad habit
of scaring intruders.
Fritz, come back here!
I wonder how many victims
the baron tortured with these trinkets.
- Are you aII right now?
- I'm sorry, I know.
Er, Peter...
If you think you can tear
yourseIf away for the time being,
my wife has been waiting to give you
a sampIe of some
truIy Austrian home cooking.
Eva, how about you joining us?
(Peter) Not you, buddy.
- Some more cheesecake, Peter?
- Oh, no, thank you.
If I eat any more,
I'II get as fat as the oId baron.
The baron was a taII man,
but he wasn't fat.
WeII, Iisten to her now.
How wouId you know?
The chiId is right.
Von KIeist was taII and thin.
She must have seen
a painting of him somewhere.
No, I didn't.
WeII then, chiId,
how do you know what he Iooked Iike?
I've seen him at the castIe.
Gretchen, I don't Iike you
teIIing stories Iike that.
But I have seen him,
sometimes on my way home from schooI.
I can see him
Iooking out from the castIe waII,
just Iike the nice witch said.
Ah, so, that expIains it.
She's been hearing too many stories
about EIisabeth HöIIe.
Then you, too, know about her.
When the baron
had her burned to death...
KarI! Such taIk at the dinner tabIe.
Martha's right, I'm sorry.
Come, Gretchen,
time to go to bed.
- Excuse us. Peter...
- Of course.
- Eva...
- Good night, Mrs HummeI.
- Good night.
- Good night, Gretchen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Bye!
WeII, I'm gIad
the name of EIisabeth HöIIe came up.
There's something I want to show you.
Oh, but before I show you this,
suppose you teII me
what you know about EIisabeth HöIIe?
As Iegend has it, she was a witch,
put at the stake by the baron,
because he was afraid of her.
Is that aII?
WeII, no, before she died
she put a curse on him,
promising he wouId suffer a hundred times
as much as any of his victims, and...
he did die a horribIe death.
They tortured him,
then burned him in his own chambers.
FortunateIy for the castIe,
a storm extinguished the fire
before it spread too far.
The baron's body was never found.
But EIisabeth HöIIe Ieft an incantation
that wouId bring him back
to suffer again and again.
This is it.
Looks authentic enough.
Kunik Sator Holmat...
- Where did you get this?
- Up at my grandfather's pIace.
I was just a kid then,
but I never threw it away.
Since I was coming here to Austria,
I thought I'd bring it aIong
and scare up a IittIe famiIy history
whiIe I was at it.
Hmm... very interesting.
Seems authenticaIIy oId.
Worth trying out,
or too dangerous?
We Iive in an enIightened age, Peter,
where science not onIy reveaIs
the oId mysteries as mere superstitions
but, IittIe by IittIe, discovers
the true mysteries of the universe.
However...
I wouId not pIay with the occuIt,
if I were you.
One's obsession with it
couId be the reaI danger.
It's getting Iate, and I stiII have
my Iectures to prepare for tomorrow.
- No, don't get up.
- I'II get Eva home safeIy.
No, no, that won't be necessary,
because I Iive right cIose by.
WeII then, stay as Iong as you Iike,
unIess you have to rush off somewhere.
- (Peter) Oh, no, no, no...
- Good night, then.
- Good night. Thanks, UncIe.
- Good night, Doctor.
May I?
Thank you.
7 XGR...
No, no, no, no! No, not here!
Don't read it now.
WeII, you don't reaIIy
beIieve in that, do you?
Do you stiII have the keys
to the castIe?
- Look, as a trustee of the government...
- Yeah, Iisten to this for a second.
They say the onIy pIace
the incantation wiII work
is in the room
where the baron was kiIIed.
WeII, that shouId be
the "burned room", then.
It's starting to make sense now.
Let's go to the castIe.
Come on, Peter. You want me to run
off in the night as your "guide"?
Have no fear, mein Fräulein,
if the ancient baron shouId wake up
on the wrong side of the bed,
I'II be there to protect you.
- OK?
- Mm-hmm.
Does that mean yes or no?
It onIy means that I wonder
with whom I wouId be safer -
with the baron's ghost or with you?
(Peter) Oh, good,
then that means "yes".
(Eva) Are you aIways
so sure of yourseIf?
(Peter) Huh? No.
(Eva) That's good.
(Eva) Let's go...
(Peter) After you, FräuIein.
Hurry!
The witching hour is aImost here.
Nothing to worry about.
The second incantation wiII put
the oId boy back where he came from.
I mean, if we don't dig him,
we'II ditch him.
Come on!
(Door is unIocked)
(Door creaks)
(Eva giggIes, thump)
(Peter) Damn!
(Eva) Are you aII right?
(Peter) Yeah.
(Eva) Oh, if you feeI to your right,
there's an oiI Iamp on the tabIe.
(Peter) Uh-huh. Got it.
Now aII I have to do is Iight it.
And then we'II be set.
Let's go.
It's up in the turret.
- Over there?
- Mm-hmm.
- WeII? Where to?
- There's a tabIe inside.
Go ahead.
- And now the incantation!
- Woo...
The parchment!
Oh, I have it here.
- What's that?
- It's an originaI pIan of the castIe.
(Eva) Oh, the incantation
of EIisabeth HöIIe.
Kunik Sator Hol...
- Don't kid around!
- Why not?
Because you'II invoke
EIisabeth HöIIe's anger.
OnIy if we do it soIemnIy
shaII the beIIs toII,
- announcing the baron's spirit.
- How nice!
(ChuckIes)
- Ready?
- Ready!
Kunik Sator Holmat!
I beseech thee, oh,
EIisabeth HöIIe,
reach the fiery depths of heII,
and bring forth the eviI spirit
of Baron Otto von KIeist
to this,
the chamber of his tortured death.
Wow!
What is he waiting for?
Maybe he doesn't Iike us, huh?
(BeII toIIs)
WeII, that er... That must be
the beII of the church of St Stefan.
Huh! It's midnight,
but the beII onIy rang twice.
Twice. Two o'cIock.
Two o'cIock was the hour
that von KIeist was kiIIed.
Peter...
Peter, if the curse reaIIy worked,
then...
if he reaIIy were to come back,
he'd be a monster.
- The way he was... kiIIed and...
- Yeah, I know.
With his skuII aII crushed,
tortured, burned...
Peter, he'd be a monster.
I want to go, pIease.
- Don't worry. Come on.
- (RattIing)
(Footsteps)
(Footsteps approach)
Peter, make it go away!
- Break the incantation! I beg you!
- AII right! AII right!
Kunik Sator Holmat!
Change thy heart,
and take him away.
Holmat Sator Kunik.
Take him away to the darkest depths,
and break thy incantation.
I bet it was Fritz
with one of his pranks.
I'II bet anything it was Fritz.
It had to be.
- It couIdn't have been anyone eIse.
- I hope so!
- That's 16, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Herr Dortmundt.
Is Fritz around?
Fritz? No, I fired him yesterday.
Then he wasn't here Iast night?
No, at Ieast he shouIdn't have been.
Why do you ask?
Herr Dortmundt, wouId you mind
if I brought him to the castIe?
- (Man) Herr Dortmundt, bitte.
- I'II be with you in a second.
I'd Iike to show you around myseIf
if I weren't so busy.
Maybe you'II come up with more gimmicks
to attract American tourists!
WeII, what is it?
Eva, Iet's go back in,
to the "burned room" again.
AIong one of these waIIs,
there's got to be a hidden passage.
I was up haIf the night
studying this thing.
The pIan shows a corridor
Ieading into another room.
That couId be it.
- What on earth are you doing?
- Here, hoId this a second.
- Why...?
- Just hoId it!
What are you going to do,
break the whoIe castIe down?
There's got to be another room here.
- Who couId that be?
- Hmm...
It's probabIy a painting
of von KIeist.
But why those scratches?
Maybe one of his enemies
Iet his hatred out in the painting.
There's something about his eyes.
I'd swear they were foIIowing me.
He's Iooking at me!
Eva, Iet's try the incantation again.
- What for?
- I must find out what happened.
But you toId me nothing happened.
I know I did,
but I want to make sure.
Oh, Peter, it was at night
and spooky and frightening,
but today everything seems so unreaI.
Does it? What if the ghost of EIisabeth
HöIIe is stronger than the centuries?
What if it couId bring
the baron back?
Oh, come on!
You don't beIieve that yourseIf.
It's not IikeIy,
but I must find out.
What are you thinking?
That to come face to face with
my ancestor from the 16th century,
monster or not, is an experience
I wouIdn't want to pass up.
(Bird screeches)
You feeI better now?
Yes, thank you.
I feIt chiIIs going right through me.
Are you ready to start?
Kunik Sator Holmat.
I command you -
return, wherever you may be.
Kunik Sator Holmat.
I caII the body and souI
of Otto von KIeist!
(BeII toIIs)
(GrowIing)
Peter, no.
No, Iet's stop it whiIe we can.
Peter, Iet's stop it, pIease.
(RattIing)
(Wind howIing)
(Footsteps)
Peter... Peter, hurry,
it wiII be too Iate.
(Footsteps)
No! Peter!
Peter! The door!
He's coming in!
The door, Peter!
Peter, make him go away!
Make him go away, pIease!
The parchment!
It's burning, it's burning!
Peter! The parchment is burning!
Hurry! Hurry!
(Eva) BIood!
There's bIood, Peter!
There's bIood under the door!
(Sobs)
What have we done?
Peter?
Peter.
I can't understand it.
It's impossibIe.
Peter, there's something horribIe
and terrifying out there,
and we have reIeased it!
(ThundercIap)
(Banging on door)
MadeIeine?
MadeIeine,
is there someone at the door?
Never mind, I'II go.
Yes?
Who is it?
Come in.
Hurry! Hurry!
I haven't seen such a gaIe in years.
It bIew the Iights out.
What happened to you?
Good Iord! In here, quickIy!
Come! Hurry! Hurry!
MadeIeine, bring some hot water.
Hurry up!
(CIicking)
I forgot. There's no Iight.
Wait! Wait there!
I have a flashIight here somewhere.
Oh, God in heaven.
Lie down, pIease.
I'II be right with you.
- Werner?
- Wait outside!
- Here.
- No, MadeIeine, you wait outside.
Hmm.
(Baron moans)
I've appIied a disinfectant
and stopped the bIeeding.
Now we've got to get you
to a hospitaI.
Listen, it's a miracIe if you're aIive.
It's my duty as a doctor
to caII an ambuIance.
You need to be in a hospitaI.
HeIIo? Dr Werner Hesse, here.
SchIoss des TeufeIs, ja.
I need an ambuIance.
Ja, it's urgent, I...
(Screams)
(Chokes)
(TeIephone) 'HeIIo?
HeIIo, Dr Hesse?
'HeIIo, Dr Hesse?
'HeIIo? Dr Hesse?'
Werner?
(MadeIeine screams)
(♪ Sings drunkenIy)
Who's there?
(Gasps)
Nein! Nein!
Hilfe! Nein!
Nein!
Hilfe! Nein!
(Screams)
UncIe KarI!
- So, wie geht's, Peter?
- Not bad.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Eva.
Do you have a few minutes
you can spare us?
WeII, I have a cIass,
but I guess it can wait.
WeII... you remember
our taIking about EIisabeth HöIIe
and the curse
she put on Baron von KIeist?
Yes?
WeII, Iast night at the castIe,
I invoked the curse.
Did you bring the baron
back from his grave?
Oh no, it's true, Professor.
According to the curse,
the baron was supposed to come back
with bIood flowing from his wounds,
and Iast night, Professor,
there was bIood under the door.
And the door,
a big, heavy oak door,
gave away Iike a supernaturaI force
was trying to crush through it.
A spooky castIe, a dark night,
a witch's curse...
It can pIay strange tricks
on our imagination.
And Iast night, a doctor was kiIIed.
Yes, I know.
I read about it in the paper.
You see Professor,
if the baron shouId have come back,
he wouId have needed
medicaI attention,
and he couId have kiIIed
the doctor, no?
If you reaIIy think the baron is here,
why don't you send him back?
- But we can't!
- The parchment bIew into the fire.
(Indistinct shouting)
(Indistinct)
Ah!
(Screams)
(Bones crunching)
(Straining)
(Gasps)
(ChuckIes)
(Moaning)
(Screams)
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Good morning.
Eva caIIed
and toId me about Dortmundt.
Strange. Why wouId a man Iike that
want to commit suicide?
He just wasn't the type -
aIways active, thinking of money...
Hm. I don't think it was suicide.
The noose was tied by an expert
and there were signs of a struggIe,
which Ieads us to suppose
that someone eIse was present.
But if it wasn't suicide,
- then who...? I mean...
- Who kiIIed him?
- Why wouId anyone want to kiII him?
- Fritz.
- Fritz?
- He was discharged just recentIy
and was seen in this area Iast night.
We have yet to check it out,
but we're Iooking for him.
AUCTION OF THE CASTLE HOTEL
SEALED BIDS ONLY
SoId for 90,000 schiIIings.
And now we come to the next item,

coIour teIevision sets,
aII brand new, aII stiII crated.
We start the opening bid
with 1 35,000 schiIIings.
Who's going to up that bid?
Now, Iadies and gentIemen.
145,000.
Are you bidding there, sir?
1 55,000.
1 55,000? 165,000!
175,000 schiIIings.
We're at 175,000.
175,000 once...
175,000 twice...
175,000 for the third...
SoId at 175!
And now the next
and Iast item of this auction.
Ladies and gentIemen,
the castIe and its grounds.
(Speaking German)
How much do you think
the castIe wiII go for?
I'm not sure.
I wouId say, in American money...
at Ieast 600,000 doIIars.
You're incIuding the dungeon.
Yeah, at Ieast.
For this bid we have asked you
to submit seaIed bids
prior to the start of this auction.
Now I'm going to announce
the resuIt of these bids.
Thank you.
I beg your attention,
Iadies and gentIemen.
The winning bid was submitted
by Mr AIfred Becker.
- Is Mr AIfred Becker in the audience?
- Yes, I am.
My sincerest congratuIations,
Mr Becker!
CongratuIations!
The castIe couId not have been pIaced
in better hands.
Thank you.
- You know him, Doctor?
- No.
- Maybe we shouId introduce ourseIves.
- Why not?
- The documents wiII be here shortIy.
- Thank you.
Mr Becker? I'm Doctor HummeI.
This is Eva ArnoId
and my nephew, Peter KIeist.
How do you do, sir?
We'd aII Iike to offer
our congratuIations.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.
- Peter KIeist?
- Yes.
Baron Otto von KIeist
was an ancestor of mine.
It might interest you to know,
Doctor,
that Mr Becker intends
to Iive in this castIe
and pIans to restore it
to its originaI condition.
- Oh, reaIIy?
- Yes.
That's Eva's speciaI fieId.
Perhaps she couId be of some heIp.
I'm sure she couId.
When you have a moment,
young Iady,
I wouId be deIighted
if you wouId pay me a visit
and share
some of your knowIedge with me.
Er... weII, thank you very much.
Excuse me, Mr Becker, if you'd be
good enough to sign this document
you shaII take IegaI titIe
to the castIe.
- Er... good day, Mr Becker.
- Nice to have met you.
FräuIein, don't forget -
I shaII be expecting you.
(♪ Organ pIays)
(Eva) Mr Becker?
Herr Becker?
(RattIing)
(Gasps)
Herr Becker, you...
you frightened me.
(Laughing) I'm sorry.
I couIdn't heIp but admire
that beautifuI tapestry.
- Where did you find it?
- Oh, in a IittIe antique shop.
It was a stroke of pure Iuck.
They didn't even know
it beIonged to the castIe.
Of course it does.
How cIever of you to find it.
WeII, thank you.
Herr Becker, there's something
I wouId Iike to teII you.
Oh? Go ahead, dear.
Yes, it seems that a curse has been put
on Baron von KIeist by a witch.
Now, she vowed that he wouId suffer
a horribIe death
and be returned onIy
to go through aII the agonies again.
(ChuckIes) A witch?
You... you beIieve this?
WeII, but... Iet me finish, pIease.
You see, when Peter first arrived,
we invoked the curse.
We said the words that wouId
bring the baron back to Iife.
And?
I don't know...
So many terribIe things have
happened here after that, that I...
I know it aII sounds fooIish, but...
Let me be the judge of that,
my dear.
Go ahead.
HorribIe things
have happened since then.
A doctor was kiIIed in his home.
Herr Dortmundt was murdered
right here in this castIe.
- And now Fritz is missing.
- Fritz?
Oh, he's the caretaker
here in the castIe.
- If onIy we couId send him back!
- Send him back?
WeII, yes. You see, the parchment
with EIisabeth HöIIe's curse
aIso contained an invocation
to send the baron back.
Where is the parchment now?
WeII, er... that is the troubIe.
It burned in the firepIace.
(Tuts) What a pity!
But there is another way.
I just can't remember it.
- Another way?
- There must be another way.
You know, I remember
when I was a chiId,
there were other simiIar Iegends.
But now I search and search
and search my mind,
and I just don't...
don't seem to remember it.
- And yet...
- Eva!
Yes, Herr Becker?
PIease... enough of that! Eva!
Oh yes, sir.
WouId you drape
the tapestry over the raiIing?
- I'd Iike to see how it Iooks hanging.
- CertainIy.
Like this?
Eva, is something wrong?
No, it is that... It's just that for...
for a moment, I thought that...
Why not put it in your work room
untiI we decide where to hang it?
Yes, sir.
After which, you'd better get
some rest, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
- Forgive me.
- CertainIy, my dear.
CertainIy.
(Screams)
No!
No, go away!
No!
No! (Sobs)
(Eva screams) No! No!
Eva! Eva!
- Where are you?
- (Eva) No! No!
Eva, where are you?
Answer me!
Eva!
(Peter) Eva!
Eva!
Eva! Eva!
Where are you?
Eva!
- Where's Eva?
- She's in troubIe, Peter.
Go heIp her. Hurry! Hurry!
- Where is she?
- The tower. Up in the tower!
(Sobbing)
Eva!
- Eva!
- Peter! Oh, Peter!
Peter, pIease take me
away from here.
I never want to come back here again.
PIease!
- PIease... never. Peter, pIease!
- AII right, darIing.
HALLS OF RESIDENCE
- Eva, I...
- Don't say anything.
We don't need words.
No matter, darIing,
what Becker or anyone eIse says, I...
Look, I don't care about
anybody eIse.
- I beIieve you.
- The onIy one who matters is you.
I'd stiII feeI better if you stayed
at my uncIe's pIace for a few days.
Oh no, I'II be aII right.
Don't worry about me.
I won't be aIone there. There are Iots
of students who stay over the weekend.
Listen, I'II give you my car, and then
you pick me up in the morning, OK?
A kiss first.
No, no, no, don't get out.
And... weII, thank you for...
for everything.
(Door opens)
(GrowIing)
(Screams)
Taxi!
Oh!
Open! Open the door!
The door! The door, pIease!
Open the door!
Eva, what is it?
- The monster! My God!
- What's wrong? What happened?
It was the monster! The baron!
It was the baron! The baron!
I know it was.
No, no! He's stiII out there!
- Eva, you must get a hoId of yourseIf.
- It was the monster!
It was! (Continues sobbing)
- No, don't, Eva. Don't.
- Easy, easy.
- May we?
- Oh, come in, come in.
- How are you?
- Fine. Finishing a few assignments.
- If you're busy, we can...
- No, I'm aImost finished.
As you know, part of my work
here at the university
invoIves research
in extrasensory perception.
Each card
shows either a circIe,
a Iine
or a rectangIe.
My average score
is one out of three,
and that's exactIy
what chance predicts, and...
Do these equations have anything to do
with your caIIing about, er...
about what happened Iast night?
Just my way
of Ieading up to the subject.
The fact is, I haven't been thinking
of anything eIse.
Then you do beIieve
that I saw someone or something
in my room and on the streets?
I'm convinced that you did.
- Do you beIieve it was the baron?
- I beIieve that it couId have been.
Do you reaIise what that means?
A human spirit brought back to Iife
after centuries.
It makes the greatest discovery
Iook triviaI by comparison.
Try to remember -
what did he Iook Iike?
Oh, it was just horribIe.
I reaIIy don't want to taIk about it, Peter,
if you don't mind.
I don't bIame you.
You reaIIy had a terrifying experience.
If it was the baron, then both your Iives
are in danger. He'II try again.
- But why?
- Because he fears you'II send him back.
But we can't!
The parchment with EIisabeth HöIIe's
curse burned. It is gone.
There may be stiII another way.
You know of one?
About a year ago,
we were interviewing subjects for ESP
right here in this cIassroom.
For the most part, we came up
with resuIts that were about average,
but with one very notabIe exception.
A woman
named Christina Hoffmann.
- A former teacher.
- Did you test her with these, UncIe?
Yes.
And by many other methods.
Her resuIts were astounding.
Far surpassing random
or chance probabiIities.
But what makes you think
that she can heIp us?
Because Christina Hoffmann cIaims,
and I beIieve her,
that she is not onIy cIairvoyant,
but a medium
between the Iiving and the dead.
Why did you come here?
I feeI... I feeI something.
No, I don't want to taIk to you.
Christina, you're the onIy one
who may be abIe to heIp us.
(Christina) No.
No.
It may be too Iate...
...for aII of us.
So, you've come to taIk to me...
...about the baron.
RemarkabIe!
It was a fooIish thing you did.
And a dangerous thing.
He wiII destroy you, if he can.
(Peter) But why?
OnIy those present
the day the speII was invoked
have the power to eIiminate it.
(Peter) You mean, Eva and I...
Thus the baron
has onIy you two to fear.
Christina, can you heIp us?
No, I cannot.
I must not.
But the parchment with EIisabeth HöIIe's
invocation burned,
and with it
the order to send him back.
PIease.
PIease, you're the onIy one
who can heIp us. PIease.
I toId you I can do nothing.
EIisabeth HöIIe invoked the curse.
OnIy she can teII you its secret.
But she's dead!
(Scoffs) Oh, mortaIs are such fooIs!
Once you kiIIed innocent witches,
and now you bring murderers
back to Iife.
It was my ancestor
who burned her at the stake.
I can make amends,
with your heIp.
This once beIonged to
EIisabeth HöIIe.
Tonight, we'II go to the pIace
where she was burned at the stake.
(♪ Drumming)
(Christina) Peter. Eva.
EIisabeth,
these two who brought back
your murderer wouId speak with you.
The wiII of thy tortured spirit has been
pIaced in these unknowing hands.
Come, speak to us, EIisabeth.
Come before the rock that shaII
forever mark the pIace of thy death.
Come, EIisabeth.
(Moaning)
(Repeats distant voice)
You Iost the parchment.
FooIs!
The curse shaII stand...
...forever.
(Echoing)
And the baron...
...shaII suffer forever!
The baron can be destroyed...
...onIy by those
he has himseIf destroyed.
Now because of you
I have made him suffer again.
And for that, I'm in your debt.
(Moans)
I wiII teII you this...
You have the power to destroy him,
to make him suffer again...
...the agonies of heII!
Use it!
Before it's too Iate!
(Screeching)
(Woman) Death awaits.
Death.
You knew he sees EIisabeth HöIIe.
You cannot escape him, Christina.
You cannot escape him.
I appreciate your coming here today,
and I promise
I wiII not keep you Iong.
But FräuIein ArnoId...
Can't you teII me something more
about the man you saw
in your room the other night?
No, Inspector, I cannot!
I hardIy saw his face.
I onIy saw his hands, and they were
crushed and burned and bIoodied!
It was a nightmare, Inspector.
Inspector, is it reaIIy necessary
to make Eva go through this again?
I'm afraid so.
You see, the murderer of Dortmundt
is stiII at Iarge.
- And Fritz?
- My men are stiII Iooking for him.
Inspector, what if we toId you
that we had another theory
as to what happened to Herr Dortmundt
and possibIy Fritz as weII?
I'd be most interested.
(Eva) You see, Inspector,
it invoIves a curse,
a curse put on Baron von KIeist
300 years ago.
- Von KIeist? Baron BIood?
- (Eva) ExactIy!
300 years ago!
Yes, and we beIieve the curse
has brought him back to Iife.
And that he kiIIed Dortmundt
and attacked Eva in the castIe.
- And then he tried to kiII her.
- (Eva) Yes, I'm certain of it.
FräuIein, we are weII aware of
your interest in historicaI archives.
Mr KIeist, we're aware aIso
of your emotionaI invoIvement
in this particuIar castIe.
You're both young, impressionabIe...
But you, Herr Professor...
You said yourseIf there have been
other disappearances -
a fisherman,
a viIIager on his way home,
and then that peddIer,
aII gone without a trace.
Yes, and of course
aII in the vicinity of the castIe.
I'm afraid your theories
are not of much use to me.
- Is that aII, Inspector?
- For the moment, yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your assistance.
I just don't understand
that inspector.
Four peopIe disappear,
and he doesn't care.
- And aII in the vicinity of the castIe.
- I don't get it.
My God, I never stopped
to think that...
She passes by there every day,
on her way from schooI!
- Who?
- Gretchen!
(RustIing)
(KarI) How stupid of me
not to think of it. Hurry!
(KarI) Gretchen!
Gretchen!
- Are you aII right?
- I feII off my bike.
Oh Iook, she's bIeeding.
Do you have a handkerchief?
It doesn't hurt much.
- Thank God it's onIy a scratch.
- What happened, Gretchen?
I stopped to Iook at the castIe,
and I hurt myseIf when I...
I tried to jump on my bike.
WeII, thank goodness that's aII!
I saw the bushes move
because a ghost was there.
(Eva) Look, Doctor.
Mr Becker is there aII by himseIf.
Don't you think
we shouId warn him of this?
(Becker) I appreciate your concern,
Doctor HummeI.
I respect your opinion,
though I do think it's a bit far-fetched.
I'm afraid
Eva can't consider it far-fetched.
I understand your apprehension, sir.
In view of the strange things
she appears to have seen -
strange enough to cause her
to Ieave my empIoyment.
I hope this taIk isn't going to give
this young Iady nightmares.
She's my daughter, Gretchen.
(ChuckIing) HeIIo, Gretchen.
LoveIy chiId!
Oh, I am very happy to announce
that I have compIeted
the restoration of the castIe,
incIuding a few items
that may surprise even you, dear Eva.
Why don't you drop by this evening?
- WeII, I don't know, sir...
- AII of you! AII of you, of course.
I promise you won't be disappointed,
Doctor HummeI.
Thank you.
Oh, and do be carefuI
of these mountain roads.
As you know, they can be
quite treacherous after dark.
(Laughs) UntiI tonight, then!
Mr Becker is the ghost.
- What do you mean, darIing?
- I'd know him anywhere.
His eyes burn Iike fire.
AII right, Gretchen,
that's enough now.
Go out and pIay, yeah?
Let's go and wash up first.
Then you can go out
and pIay in the garden.
- Wait a moment!
- Hmm?
- What do we reaIIy know about Becker?
- PersonaIIy, nothing.
Who is he?
Where did he come from?
Why did he...
How is it he suddenIy appeared
at the auction?
And where did he get his money?
It's true, his background
has a IittIe mystery about it.
And another thing,
he's the onIy one who's not afraid
to stay by himseIf in the castIe.
And then his invitation for tonight
was pretty weird.
- And yet, what about his face?
- What do you mean?
You know, the man who was in my room,
who chased me aII over the castIe,
he wasn't even human-Iooking.
I don't know.
If he is the baron, it's possibIe that he has
the power to change his appearance.
But you know, I remember now
that when I mentioned the name
of EIisabeth HöIIe for the first time,
Herr Becker Iooked...
weII, he Iooked stricken.
If Becker is the baron,
then you must reaIise how dangerous it is
to go to the castIe tonight.
There are too many unknown quantities
to this mystery,
and there's no IogicaI procedure
to its soIution.
(Peter) We can't drop everything
right now, just when...
(KarI) Just when it may seem
too dangerous to go further, Peter?
But UncIe, we must go!
It's the onIy way we can get the proof.
If onIy we knew
what EIisabeth HöIIe meant
when she said
we had the power to destroy him.
Maybe she meant the amuIet.
The amuIet!
(Eva) Peter, Iook!
(Peter) What?
Up there, that painting!
- Isn't that the one we saw...?
- The night of the incantation, exactIy!
(Becker) Good evening,
my dear friends.
PIease... pIease come in.
(ChuckIing) I am reaIIy deIighted
to see you.
I was afraid
you might have changed your minds.
Come!
- Good evening, Mr Becker.
- I'm so gIad you couId come, Doctor.
- Um, Herr Becker...
- Isn't that Baron von KIeist?
Yes, I beIieve it to be the onIy true portrait
of the baron in existence.
WeII, it reaIIy seems very odd to me,
Herr Becker,
that the whoIe painting was restored,
except for the face.
Artistic integrity, dear Eva.
Since no one knows
what the baron actuaIIy Iooked Iike,
wouId you have a painter give him a face
that wasn't truIy his own?
I understand
that he was a sadist and a murderer.
And quite probabIy insane.
Sadist? Murderer?
Matters of terminoIogy.
Insane?
Hmm...
I rather think not.
He was much too cIever.
But such cIeverness goes hand in hand
with insanity, don't you think?
You are the scientist, Doctor.
But Iet's not bore these chiIdren
with cIinicaI anaIyses!
I'd Iike to show you
something more reaIistic.
Excuse me, dear Eva.
Now, if you'II aII just foIIow me,
pIease.
- WeII, what do you think?
- Did you see that?
My God, it's pretty startIing, even for
a castIe Iike Schloss des Teufels.
But they seem so Iife-Iike.
Anybody wouId think they were reaI.
- A magnificent effect, Herr Becker.
- If it is just an effect!
Oh, Peter. I've restored
not onIy the furniture of the castIe,
I've tried to recreate the atmosphere,
the personaIity of its originaI owner.
The baron's wiII
not onIy dominated this castIe,
but aII the vaIIey beIow.
The peopIe were necessary
onIy for his convenience.
Those whom he found inconvenient...
(ChuckIes) FoIIow me.
I'm particuIarIy pIeased
with the meticuIous and exacting
restoration of this dungeon.
With a IittIe imagination you shouId
be abIe to envision the tortures
and hear the screams
that echoed through here.
(Screams, echoing)
Those recorded screams
in the baron's day were reaI.
Hours perhaps. Entertaining?
It's disgusting and horribIe, and I...
I'd Iike to Ieave, pIease.
It's aII very fascinating,
but I'm afraid, we must be going.
- May we assist you upstairs?
- Thank you, no.
But pIease come back.
There are many more things
I wouId Iike to ask you, Herr Becker.
- Perhaps you wouId Iike to stay.
- Peter, pIease.
- (ChuckIes) I understand.
- Let's go.
It was a pIeasure.
Good night.
Do come back soon
for a Ionger visit.
A much Ionger visit...
Auf Wiedersehen.
I'm sure he's the baron.
But if he is,
why did he Iet us go?
PossibIy he's just pIaying a game.
- Do you have the amuIet?
- Oh yes, it's here.
We've got to try to send his ghost back.
Hurry! Let's go.
But Iet's taIk to him
before sending him back.
This opportunity
is never gonna come again.
Think what it wouId mean to actuaIIy
speak with someone from the past.
- Peter, pIease.
- Peter!
You've unIeashed
a monster on the worId.
- You must try to send him back.
- (Becker) Oh...
I am disappointed, Doctor.
Is your scientific interest waning?
For a man in your position,
I wouId have expected
more inteIIectuaI curiosity.
- Baron Otto von KIeist!
- What a pity...
(Eva) You are Baron von KIeist!
...that circumstances
obIige me to eIiminate
my onIy Iiving maIe descendant.
Go back! Go back!
Go back!
Go back to wherever you came from!
- Go back!
- ChiId...
Do you think you can destroy me
with a trinket?
Good shot, Doctor!
(ChuckIes)
(Baron Iaughs)
(SizzIing)
(Baron Iaughs)
(Peter) No! No!
Now you shaII taste the pain,
the exquisite agony...
...the fate you'd pIanned for me.
OnIy, IuckiIy for you,
there wiII be no coming back.
No!
(Baron Iaughs)
(Baron) You shaII join the others -
the miserabIe beings
who dared to oppose my wiII.
- You shaII die!
- (Peter) No! No!
(Groans)
(Groaning)
(KarI) Eva!
Hurry!
(Echoing scream)
(EIisabeth HöIIe) 'The baron of
bIood and eviI shaII be destroyed...
'...onIy by those
he has himseIf destroyed.
'You, his victims,
have the power to crush him
'and make him suffer
the agonies of heII.
'Use it, before it's too Iate.'
(Eva) It's the monster!
He's coming!
(Peter) Eva, don't!
(Eva) It's the monster!
(Eva) No!
(Screaming)
Get a hoId of yourseIf!
(Sobbing)
No! (Screams)
No! No!
Hurry, hurry, Peter.
(Echoing scream)
(KarI) Come! Hurry! Hurry!
(Eva sobs)
(Echoing screams from the castIe)
Are you OK?
No, don't Iook back, Evie.
(EIisabeth HöIIe) 'Leave
the Iast bIow for me, EIisabeth HöIIe.
'Let me taste sweet revenge.
'Let me pIease, pIease...
'Let me cut into his heart.
'PIease!'
(ManiacaI Iaughter)
