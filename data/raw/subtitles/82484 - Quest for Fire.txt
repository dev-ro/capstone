80.000 years ago mankind was born.
The prehistoric man knew how to conserve the gift
of fire that nature was willing to grant him
(thunderbolts and firespewing volcanoes),
but he did not have the ability to
create this element on his own.
Possession of fire, which we take for granted
today, was the cause of untold confontations
and strife,
as only possession of fire quaranteed
life and survival in those hard times.
Fire was used not only to fry caught game, but
also to protect from the terrible cold of the
glaciers and the intrusion of wild animals.
Fire, with its lifegiving force, was the
nucleus of the protohuman communities.
He, who possessed fire, possessed life.
