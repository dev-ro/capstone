- Maaa…!
Hey Muna
Give us a hand
Push it now
Give me some betel nut
- You’ll get it from me
- You’re always playful
- Hey bamboo
- Get lost!
Hey Munaruna!
Measure this and tell me
Boss, either call me by
my full name Murugappa
Or call me just Muruga
If you say ‘Munaruna’
sounds like some Indian coin
We are working for
mercantile class, right?
Naturally we get influenced
by their language!
You’ll always be Munaruna
I’m Sunapena
He’s Kenapana!
Measure for me now
Instead of making small talk
28.5”
Tell me properly
Not an approximate figure
You'll believe only this tape
Not my word, huh?
Is it right?
‘Inch’ineer!
Perfect, I say
Why do you need a tape
and an engineer for this?!
Rowdy fellow!
Oldie, move
Let me take over
Dumbass dodo!
Bad breath bimbo!!
Why are you messing with me?
Jobless or what?
To flirt like this
We’ll be sharing a bed
Why can’t I share a cucumber?
Me...in your bed?
Catch hold of your
bad-breathed betrothed
That scrawny scarecrow, huh?
As if I’m a guardian deity
tall and strong?
You’ve got your abs
in place, real cool
Take your hands off me
Why are you bugging me like this?
Ironical!
The man loves his fiancee
But she loves his donkey!
Who is the donkey?
You only!
Attend to your work
Hey! Muruga
What are you doing?
Why are you going there?
You’ll fall
Careful
Murugappa!
(Burmese voices in uproar)
Samudraaa…!
Watch out
Don’t be scared
You are safe now
Your hands and legs
are shaking like jelly
I feel like I’m seeing
Lord Muruga face to face
If you hadn’t been there
imagine my daughter’s plight!
Are you a Tamilian?
My mother is a Tamilian
My father is Burmese
Classic love story!
Keep quiet
2000 kyat
That's your worth
You just hailed me as God
Now you think I can be bought?
Sonny, don’t get me wrong
- Not like that?
- For my satisfaction
You shouldn’t put a price on life
Did you buy your
daughter in a market?
Money can’t buy everything, you know
Forgive me
What’s your name?
Munaruna
- Shut up
- You were too good!
Murugappan
You think yourself to be
the bravest of braves
You’re jumping around
like Lord Anjaneya
Do you know the price of teak?
A whole day’s work
is ruined because of you
Both of you clear out from here
Let’s go
Tata
- Hey Muna
- What?
Look who’s here
“Girl, charming and fair
with hibiscus in her hair”
“She has blossomed
with love, come”
“Cherished princess
Rangoon Highness”
“Waiting for you
Night and day, dear beau”
“This is a first time pleasure
Down the spine joyful quiver”
“Will you tell me
in detail clearly?”
“My gray cells cuddled up snug
Butterflies in my stomach”
“Will you give me
a medicine as remedy?”
“Goodness gracious me!”
“Maiden, lovely and fair
with hibiscus in her hair”
“Only for you
she has bloomed new”
“Treasured princess
Rangoon Highness”
“Waiting for you
24x7, dear beau”
“You’re a jewel in the crown
I’m rock salt in rain wind-blown”
“My fingers to caress you
how am I the suitable beau?”
“I am 24 carat gold brick
You’re a metal box, best pick”
“To protect and preserve me
No one else but you solely”
“Though love is on a spree
mind just won’t agree”
“Shadow won’t get wet ever
even if it falls into the river”
“Dizzy desire inside
won’t cast you aside”
“Lass, eye-catching and fair
with hibiscus in her hair”
“Has she blossomed
for me wholesome?”
“Revered princess
Rangoon Highness”
“Is she waiting for me
night and day wistfully?”
Slow down
“Every second encircles me
like a clock’s 2nd hand, pointedly”
“Chase me, dearest
in right earnest”
“Take this water lily
waiting willingly”
“I’ve lifted sacks of tamarind
Now I’ll carry a floral godsend”
“My chic chick, with a twist
I’ll chain you on my hip as amulet”
“My mind seesaws, hesitating
to be just your hip-string”
“I’d rather be a thread sacred
for you and me to be duly wed”
“With your eyes you enticed me
this love is forever truly”
“Lass, pretty and fair
with hibiscus in her hair”
“She has bloomed
for you well groomed”
“Desired princess
Rangoon Highness”
“Waiting for you
come, beloved beau”
“This is a 1st time pleasure
Down the spine sensual quiver”
“Will you explain to me
crystal clear precisely?”
“My gray cells cuddled up snug
Butterflies in my stomach”
“Will you tell me, darling
a cure for this feeling?”

Samudra
Muna?
Samudra, I’m leaving
Where?
To my country
It felt so good all these days
spending time with you
Knowing I’m leaving you behind
and won’t be able to see you...
...I can’t bear the thought, Samudra
It is the fate of this wretched love
I’m going
Don’t leave me behind
I’ll also come with you
I can’t be here without you
Take me with you
to your country, Munaruna
Samudra, they’ll kill him
if you come along with us
If I leave her behind
I’ll myself die
Muruga...Muruga
Malli...Mallika
Dress her up as a Tamilian
Go...get inside
Take off your jewellery
- Munaruna!
- Our mason-boss
Someone might see us
Keep your head bent
Come...come
Stand in a line
I didn’t do this
deliberately, sir
Bloody thief!
Trying to smuggle gold
out of our country
If I go back without even this
I have to hang myself to death
Just go, or else
you’ll rot in our jail
You white swine!
You won’t prosper
May your clan rot in hell
Come...come
Thank God we reached
Our child is missing
- Hey Munaruna
- Bro...?
My little girl is missing
She must be there somewhere
- Please look for her
- I’ll do that, bro
Security, close the gate
She must be there
Look for her please
Hold her
Yov! Let me in too
I came along with them
I’m begging you
Open the gate
Open the gate, dammit
Go...go
Don’t stop
Samudra...!
Come, Samudra
Murugappaa!
Come, Samudra
I’m going back to Murugan
I’m going
Remove your wedding chain
Put it around her neck, Mallika
Don’t hesitate
Do it, Mallika
No more room in this ship
Send everyone away
She is his wife, sir
Use force
if they don’t obey
I’m begging you
You’re like God to me
Let go of my feet,
you bloody mongrel!
Bloody idiot!
Why are you hitting him?
Sir, I’m begging you
Palani, don't beg like that
If he doesn’t come with us
this girl will die, sir
Poor thing!
His wife, sir
They just got married, sir
Please don’t split them
Please have mercy on us
Hey soldier!
Yov! He's calling you
Open the gate
Send only him
Come...come in
Thank you very much, sir
Close the gate
Lock it
Don’t let anyone in
Stop the ship
Follow me
Search every nook
and corner of the ship
You go that side
Quick...hurry up
Please don’t hold on
to my ship anymore
I’m not smuggling
any assets from Burma
I’m only taking
Tamil patriots with me
Before sunset I have to
cross
Pazundaung creek
Soldiers, get out of this ship
Let’s look for them
in the next ship
What?
Mallika, what are you doing?
Bloody mongrel!
Spare us, please
Samudra...!
Let go of her
Don’t do anything to her, sir
Arrest him
Let go of me, please
Muruga!
Are you even human?
Go, get them
Let go of her
I’ll shoot you
Shoot them
Muna...Munaruna...get up
Open your eyes
This isn’t Burma
Chennai
You aren't Samudra
You are Madhu
Usually in regression therapy,
only childhood memories are tapped
But you are imagining
a previous birth
Of course your story
was very interesting
That wasn’t fiction, doctor
It was fact
Madhu, even your dream-
Sorry, even your story
I meant
it's very creative
Even in this birth I'm meeting
people whom I knew in Burma
They even snatched
your chain from your mat!
But I haven’t met
only Munaruna as yet
Romance aside, Madhu,
don’t skip your medicine
Ma, I’m late for work
Get my breakfast ready
Shower and
come soon
Let me go, madam
"Cherished princess
Rangoon Highness"
You make a mess
of everything
Come
Are you calling me?
Come
Closer?
Come closer
Might bang!
Munaruna...!
You’re that breed, huh?
What the hell is happening here?
I don’t know, madam
She called me close to her
and blabbered some name aloud
Why do you make
my nerves
somersault?
What happened to you?
Another dream, huh?
- God help me!
- Nothing, ma
Get dressed and
come down to eat
- Later...later
- Get lost!
Sit down and eat leisurely
I’m late for work, mom
Hello, Radhakrishna
I need money urgently
Sign here, dear
Only last week you cashed
a check for a millon
What did you spend that on?
I gave your mother
the accounts last week
He had to give some bonus
to our mill workers, Madhu
Okay, fine
What’s this amount for?
To pay custom’s duty, dear
Sis, enough
Your husband willed
all his wealth to a trust
In case anything untoward
happens to his daughter
She’s suspicious
Just like her dad
I came only because
you asked me to supervise
I don’t want to be
humiliated further
Let me go
Radha, Madhu isn’t normal
She suddenly wakes up
from a nightmare
I’m myself so scared
She yells at us only because
she can take that liberty
You use these sentimental
dialogs to zip my lips
They pile her with work
and then to de-stress her...
...they send her to
a psychiatrist also
That won’t work
You should give her
the medicine our Guruji gav-
She’s taking it
Why drive a car when you are
fit to drive only an auto?
Why are you glaring?
Which department?
New recruit, huh?
Hey! Wait
Where are you off to?
He has broken the ear
of our shrew’s Cooper
You broke the mirror
of that Mini Cooper
She’ll pickle you alive
Who?
A real shrew works in
our creative department
All I have to do
is replace the mirror
Even if you offer to
replace her car...
...she won’t keep quiet
Child’s play
Really?
1000 bucks bet
Let’s see
Let’s catch the lift
If the lift was door-less
they'll hang on to it like a bus
Hi Madhu
Hi Jagan
Bet with me, huh?
That shrew is behind you
Is she here?
Sir broke the side mirror
of your dinky car
- Dinky car!
- Shut up
Not me
Sir’s golden words!
Peter, Ashwin needs
a medical insurance policy
Catch you later, dude
Sorry, by mistake I broke
your side view mirror
I’ll replace it
Do you recognize me?
Yes, shre-
Jagan told me
I hit it by mistake
Why apologize?
Who else will
hit on me?!
Do I seem familiar to you?
I’m new to this office
I joined only 10 days ago
Why are you looking at
that switch and talking, Munaruna?
Moron of a man, huh?
Ashwin
Why are you avoiding
eye contact with me?
Oh! Beautiful girls
are always problematic
Can't sleep a wink
But dream a lot
Must find silly forwards
and keep texting
Be a glib liar
and a poet laureate
Spend on gifts
Life will become topsy-turvy
That’s why I don’t
look twice at beautiful girls
But I can keep looking
at you nonstop
I’m in a soup only if
the girl is beautiful!
Bye
I knew
you’d come back
How?
It said so here
When I opened my car roof
I left my mobile behind
As if we need
any reason to meet again?
I’m not a ‘roadside Romeo’
if that's what you think
Cross my heart
You, me, my car
and your phone...
...can’t tamper
with our destiny
Jump!
Kali...are you alright?
Who is Kali?
Ashwin, what happened?
You left me alone
and walked away!
She looks at me weirdly
And talks strangely
She changes my name
from floor to floor
Some girls change even their guys!
Good morning,
my dear lamp post
Hey Ashok! Why do you look
like you’ve seen a ghost?
What happened?
Your 2nd girlfriend
dumped you, huh?
We’ll take the lift
on the next block, sir
A minor accident, sir
Come on, tell me
What happened?
Cable snapped in the lift, sir
How can the cable in
a brand new lift snap?
What’s happening, here?
Gently
Are you alright?
Kiran, my friend
He was so brave
He saved her
Have we met before?
No, sir
I’m Ashwin
I joined just 10 days ago
in System Admin
How old are you?
22-23?
25, sir
You look very young
That’s why I asked
Why are you hovering around?
Only the lift isn't working
Not your legs
You can take the stairs
Okay, dude
Catch you later
Ashok, we must be very careful
Hi Mallika!
Sorry...sorry
Meera
Hi Madhu
Was that a trial for
some adventure game?
Madhu, stop it
Is this an adventure?
Meera, shall we rehearse
in Ooty for my hot video game?
Looking good, but you are
too fat and old for it
What are you doing here?
Just been half an hour
since your accident in the lift
Do you know what I feel
every time I see you?
I wish I was
20 years younger
Compared to these boys here...
...you are more capable
Coming to the point...
...why have we assembled here?
‘Gang of Ganges’ game
we released last week...
...has record breaking
downloads within 7 days
40 million!
Soooper doooper hit
We rock, dude
But friends
let me tell you
Games have jumped beyond
the playground to TV and PC...
...into our palms with
these mobile phones
100 adventures
on our fingertips
So we-
Pah!
Anyway the world market is
waiting for our next release
We are on a killing deadline here
Within 3 months...
...we must release a new game
That’s impossible
Don't underestimate yourselves
So to beat it
we’ll all work 24x7
Kiran, assign me in
any shift of your choice
But don’t club me
with this Genie
Don’t bang me
Given a chance
you'll get married to me!
So just to get you all going
as usual in our farmhouse...
...let us have
what-a-wow
Wild hog party!
“Enough of your 9 to 5 battle, guys
Dried up plants need water to survive”
“Shall I mix you a Bloody Mary?
Or bathe in Long Island ice tea?”
“Shall we live in a land of plenty
flowing with milk and honey?”
“You’ll sing, dance, play, never tired
Not a bit bored or disinterested”
“If you don’t seize this day
tomorrow will bring zilch, nix, nay”
“Yolo...yolo...yolo...yolo
You Only Live Once!”
“Yolo...yolo...yolo...yolo
You Only Live Once, bro”
“Shall we mix some spice
to a pure and simple vanilla life?”
“Shall we churn ambrosia sweet
from the sea of love as treat?”
“Date, pear or hourglass figure right
‘Bottoms up’ with eyes shut tight”
“No love or emotion in play
Only pleasure matters today”
“Touch and caress, ignite desire
like flint stones spark a fire”
“If a sea of troubles you are in
there’s no taboo word as sin”
“Yolo...yolo...yolo...yolo
You Only Live Once!”
“Yolo...yolo...yolo...yolo
You Only Live Once, bro”
'Indian ‘parotta’ minced
with barbeque mixed'
'Set your ginger beer away
Get sloshed with this cold beer, baby'
'Princess! Come forward a little bit
Sway your hips, hit on me in a dizzy fit'
'Kiss me on my cheek
Make my knees go weak'
'Will you come once more
Bird so proud, encore?'
“Why be on guard, innocent or shy?
When you hug, shyness says bye-bye”
“Gone with the wind forever
if you date, ditch or whatever”
“Why be on alert, innocent or shy?
When you hug, shyness says bye-bye”
“Shut up and kick ass now
Time is right for us...wow!”
“As the breeze flows
my eyes close”
“I simply surrender
leaning on your shoulder”
“As I sweat in this cold
Our fingers interlace to hold”
“As our lips meet to fuse
let’s fly in the sky enthused”
“Yolo...yolo...yolo...yolo
You only live once, bro”
“You only live once
in a lifetime”
“You only live once
in a lifetime”
Hello?
Munaruna, my system crashed
Not booting, Murux
I’ll be there in 2 minutes
Is this your new idea of
finding an excuse to flirt?
Graphics card
has been removed
Hey bandicoot, did you
eat up your fritter-bait?
No, this is a female rat
She ate her sandwich
dipping it in sauce
And plugged it out
with
the same saucy hand!
Oh! White rat's handiwork, huh?
Ashwin one minute
My game is auto crashing
I can't work
Check my system too, please
My shift is over
I’m leaving
Muna, wait
I have a gift for you
Why now?
When you gave me a jujube...
...did I refuse it?
Jujube...?
Oh my gawd!
Whole department is crazy
Last night in my dream
you were wearing a similar hat
Is this some cowboy film?
Wear it just once
and show me
Uncle?
Guests are waiting down
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, uncle
Hey!
Middle class
If you don’t behave yourself
your parents will be minus a son!
Want me to be the son-in-law
of this house, Mr Radhakrishnan?
What is this ‘whitener uncle’ saying?
Nothing
He shoves his hand
always into his pocket
Maybe he has
1 finger less or more
Don't be silly!
That's a quickie for sure!
Keep still
for 2 minutes
Isn’t it lovely?
Hence the labor of love, huh?
She’s piling gifts on me
like a madcap and torturing me
Cross your heart and tell me
You aren’t the least bit
interested in her?
If I don’t see her
even for 1 day...
...I feel I’m missing her
Falling in love, huh?
You can assume that
Now and then
love will
raise its head at me
She’ll tell such a Mahabharath
I'll get deflated!
She should see this today
And her mania for piling
gifts
on me should vanish
Your 'Miss Santa Claus' is here
Wonder what’s her
‘gift for the day’
What does this mean?
You like me
You gave me a belt
I like Tommy
I gifted it to him
You...!
What are you
looking for, Madhu?
Stone is your gift for today?!
Get lost,
you madcap!
Jagan, look at him
He's insulting my gifts
Your gifts should be
more personal
Your gifts should always
bond with him like second skin
What do you mean?
Slid...slipped...shifted
If I had fallen,
I’d have been dead
The giant wheel titled
suddenly to one side
Old chair
Mother-in-law’s
That’s when Munaruna
came sliding on a rod
Like Tarzan he jumped
and gave me his hand
Munaruna hugged me tight
You can’t believe it, right?
But I swear, aunty
The bond Ashwin and I share...
...goes beyond this birth
Hello Munaruna!
Who asked you
to come here?
Aunty, shouldn’t I see
the house I’ll be living in?
Come up with an answer
for this, my dear bro
Shantha, give me
a hot cup of coffee
Specimen!
Hello, dear
Hope your dad is fine
- Do you know her?
- Of course I do
Your brother’s daughter-in-law
Your daughter-in-law it seems!
Oh sorry!
I forgot
Memento-memory!
I forgot to give you this
I don’t want any gifts
Clear off from here
Aunty, is this fair?
In Burma, when we were in love
every time he came to see me...
...he'd bring wood apple,
jamun,
jujube, cranberry-
Twisted tamarind?
Elephant’s memory!
If I give him a gift
in return, he’s so mean
Leave
You’re bent on
packing me off
Aunty. see you
Uncle, tata
Good Lord!
Look at this
Don't I know
how
her mind works?
That too rainbow colors!
How did she guess
your size so accurately?
She sees it everyday
How can she go wrong?
She'll even put it on me
Whaat?
Where does all this
'smarty-pantiness' happen?
Shucks! I thought
she got me a cap
Disgusting!
She’s a real whacko
I’ll take the mickey out of her
What’s more to ‘take’?!
You had your fun!
Out you go
Be your age
Don’t act over smart
Gawd! Why do all these girls
around me hound me like this?
Let go of me
Ashwin?
Meera, what happened?
What's wrong?
They are pulling
my clothes off me
They are chasing me
Who?
- Save me
- Show me
They chase me in a group
Group?
Through the ventilator
in the air-conditioner
What’s going on here?
She saw something
and was terrified
Terrified of what?
I don’t-
You go
Go, I’ll take care
Madhu, 3D assets of
the concept art are ready
Shall we take a look?
How long has she
been working here?
About a year now
Did she have any problem?
Madhu, don’t stay here
Listen to me
Inquiry is pending
Please wait
Not only this birth
I won’t let you unite
with him in any birth
Meera, what are you saying?
Doctor...doctor
Meera is alive
See for yourself
Check her pulse
She is dead
She died
half an hour ago
Don’t take it lightly
Check her once more
Madhu, please
Pull yourself together
She spoke to me
No...!
Meera threatened me, Ashwin
Please stop it
I pushed you with deadlines
and didn’t give you enough rest
Madhu, are you regularly
consulting Dr Radhika or not?
I thought I’ll finish
this project and then go
Nothing is more important
than your health
Ashwin, your responsibility
to take Madhu to Dr Radhika
And ensure she's de-stressed
Let’s go
You're wrong to think
she is blabbering
Her memories of
a previous birth are real
Light a camphor and bring
- Guruji?
- Yes, Radhakrishna?
When she gets those memories
she becomes very tensed
There is a medicine
to make amends
It will destroy evil and
give
her peace of mind too
Along with the herbal mix
I gave you earlier...
...take this also
daily without fail
Guruji
I’m in love
with a chap
But a dead girl
threatened me
What is the solution
for this, Guruji?
This has special powers
If it’s around your wrist
no evil power can touch us
The seer told me
My family swears by him
Nutcase!
Am I a bucket to be
pulled out of a well?
Believing some
goddamn god man!
I’m leaving
I have some urgent-
Don’t run
Do you know your name
some 100 years ago?
Veerapandiya Kattabomman
the Polygar chieftain?
No, Ilamaran
You were a prince
I was a princess
You fought a terrible war
And galloping
on a single horse...
...we were on our honeymoon
I have urgent work,
my dear angel
Let’s meet for
dinner tonight
What do you think
of yourself?
Uncle, he’s my friend
Won’t you get it
if I warn you once?
Why are you flirting
with my niece?
Are you mad?
I’m pleading with her
I’m asking her
to leave me alone
I know your petty mentality
Are you trying to hook her
to grab all her wealth?
I don’t fancy falling for a girl
whose affluence I can’t match
And toe the line as
a docile son-in-law!
If you are loaded
lock her up at home
Why make her work for
what’s peanuts to you?
Go to Bombay or Dubai
Get hold of an Ambani
or some business tycoon
Ask her to lure his son
and get them happily married
Instead, you’re picking on m-
If you ask me to break up
and find someone else...
...I’ll chop you to pieces
Please understand
However many births...
...I’m for you and you’re for me
That’s how it will always be
Do you know what love is?
You won’t realize its value
when you are together
You’ll understand
only when you are separated
It is the fate of this wretched love
Will this thread
bind us together?
No need this birth
or any previous birth
I love you

Apple of my eye”

Body bedecked in gold all over”
“Even if as a flower I’m wind-blown

Small spark of a volcano fiery”
“Come close to me
Tiny drops of sea merrily”

Eyes, sharp golden spear”

- Wait...Madhu!
- Maaraa?
- Ilamaaraaaa!
- What happened?
Water
They backstabbed us
They were with us
and betrayed us
Madhu?
Are you okay?
You’re okay?
Youngsters today are under
terrific stress, especially IT field
And your company tops
my list for stress
Feelings buried deep
in the subconscious level...
...will come out like this
for some as illusions
I’m trying regression
therapy on Madhu
In her case the boundary line
between illusion and reality is very thin
Reality seems like a dream
and vice versa to her
Then what about
previous birth and all that?
All that is crap
Her fertile imagination!
But only what’s true is...
...she’s madly in love with you
I know, doctor
She should attend sessions regularly
Take the medicine
I prescribe without fail
Let's go
Ashwin, when you were
the prince Ilamaran...
...you used to swirl a sword
much heavier than you
I was zapped
Even if you’re scrawny...
...do you know how strong
and sturdy a prince you were
Madhu...in this traffic
won’t you see where you’re going?
I love him
I left the car key
in the clinic
You be here
I’ll bring it
What?
Hey! Mad or what?
Drive
Sit on my lap and drive
Why are you driving
in this break neck speed?
When I sat with you
in your horse and galloped...
...how fast you rode
while I was screaming in fright
My head is spinning
Madhu, slow down
‘Slow down’
Kiss me
Kiss me and
I’ll slow down
Watch the road
You won’t kiss me?
Watch me then
Stop the car first
Stop the car
Madhu, stop before you hit someone
She’ll be fine
Water in her lungs
has been cleared
Okay, doctor
You won’t end up
without killing her?
Sir, he was the one
who saved her
You should thank him
Doctor, I’ll take her
to Apollo hospital
Sir, you can take her home
She’ll be conscious soon
Sister, give him
an anti tetanus injection
Come with me, sir
I don’t know why
Kali killed him
You think Kali
is the culprit, sir?
The knife has only Kali’s fingerprints
That’s why I’m fairly certain
I don't know what to say
Poor jailor Joseph!
Nowadays even girls
can’t be trusted
Can you believe this,
knowing Kali is a murderer...
...Kalyani has run away
with him to Bombay
Sir, you are wrong
Kali didn’t kill the jailor
How do you know?
I can show you where they are
It is all a conspiracy, sir
He was framed
Kali did not kill
Kali didn’t kill
Madhu...?
Madhu dear
What’s wrong?
What's affecting you?
Inspector Gopinath
was right here
Where is he?
Madhu, let’s go home
If you take rest
you will be fine
You tell me
I heard him talking
Where is he?
He even has a scar on his cheek
Gopinath?
I’m the Inspector for this area
I got the information
just now and I’m here
I spoke to him
a few minutes ago
I even saw the dead man
in a stretcher
Sir, the accident car
belonged to me
I’m her friend
I’ll explain in detail
Okay, come with me
Is that girl a drug addict?
No, doctor
We come from a respectable family
But the report won’t lie
Patient is a regular druggie
She is yet to be married
Please change this report
Sir, if I tamper with it
the police will skin me alive
It's in your hands
I’m not asking you
to do it for free
I’m most willing to
grease your palm
Thanks, sonny
Think you can get away mixing
drugs in my niece’s cool drink?
Yov! Think you’re very clever!
You bring some damn seer
and brew some concoction
Then try to make her loony
and loot all her wealth, huh?
How dare you
talk to me like that!
Sir...sir
Let go of him
Are you pinning the blame on us?
Madhu, you get in
Last night I just couldn’t sleep
I came to work only to see you
I want to be with you always
Look here, Ashok
Hey, boss!
Only yesterday you dived
with your car into the deep
And you’re back to work
Ashwin, drop her at home
1 strawberry
1 coffee
Do you know in how many births
we’ve tried to unite?
Don’t start this again
It’s true we knew
each other in Burma
It’s also true
you were born...
...as Ilamaran and
me as Shenbagavalli!
But my uncle and Meera are trying
to keep us apart in all our births
We shouldn’t let them win, Ashwin
Not just this lifetime
In all our future births too
we must prove we’ll be together
Enough, Madhu
Come with me
Where?
Mohammed, play Meera’s footage
which we checked the other day
Rewind that and zoom it
Look closely
When the sheet flies
you are the one crying
Her lips don’t move at all
Did you see that?
How will a corpse
talk to you, Madhu?
You were the one talking
I didn’t imagine it
Something went wrong
when this was recorded
I swear Meera spoke to me
Get this into your head
The books you read,
films you watched...
...what you heard
someone speak
...are tumbling out
as fertile imagination
Now you’ve suddenly come up
with Kali and Kalyani
And some Inspector Gopinath
with a scar on his face
No one like that exists
Just illusions
Images in your mind
You are foolis-
No, Ashwin
Believe me
Madhu, please understand
You are just mentally sick
Madam, someone has
come to see you
Madam, the one reading
a newspaper over there
I’m Commissioner Gopinath
The head constable who came to
the hospital yesterday called me
It seems you asked for me
identifying me with this scar
Almost 25 years ago...
...when I was an Inspector
I handled that case
Kali and Kalyani killed a jailor
and escaped to Bombay
And we closed that file
I’m astonished
You’re both carbon copies
of Kali and Kalyani
Your assumption
is wrong, sir
Kali and Kalyani
didn’t kill anyone
They didn’t escape
to Mumbai either
I’ll show you where they are
Stop...stop
This is the place
There must be
a banyan tree here
Is there any banyan tree here?
There isn’t any banyan tree here, sir
Okay, you go
Sir, there was
a huge banyan tree
It fell in the storm
that hit us when MGR died
The root of that tree can be found
near the tea shop even now, sir
That’s the tree stump
Okay, you can go
Here?
How can they be here?
Clear the crowd first
Hey! Look here
Sir, come here
Don’t use spades and crowbars
Carefully remove the mud
Okay, sir
Enough...enough
All of you come out
Irudayaraj, come to
Vyasarpadi railway station
Send the forensic people
to the spot immediately
Inform the Press too
Do you recognize them?
This is you
That is me
Is it a film by Vittalacharya
with special effects?
Looks like you’ll now say
they’ll both dance?!
You opened a case
that was closed for 25 years
Madhumita, you are unbelievable
I never even imagined
You have the key
to this mystery
We have lots to discuss
I will come back to you
You can go now
I’ll stay, sir
That’s alright
We’ll finish all formalities
and I’ll talk to you
Velu, drop them in their office
Please go
Madhu, how do you
know all this?
Why didn’t you tell me?
Whatever I tell you...
...you make fun
that I’m spinning a yarn
At least now
will you believe me?
- See you, sir
- Okay, Ashwin
Wait, I'll come down
Whom are you waving at?
What's this letter in your hand?
Aren't you the newspaper boy?
Just do your job and keep going
I'm calling my girl friend
Smart-Alec chopstick!
Oh, girl friend, huh?!
Come with me
I'm terrified of dogs
That dog is even more
terrified of you
Don't lie
This dog is okay but
there's a worse dog inside
Her brother
I'm that dog!
Hey! What are you doing?
Who's that?
Your future son-in-law, ma
What's wrong with this house?
Look at the way you have
raised your beloved daughter
In that 1/2 hour
I’m away jogging...
...some random boy
signals to my sister
And she happily responds
Given a chance,
he’d have eloped with her!
Is this how a 9th grader behaves?
Bro, please call your sister
You want me to call her?
I'll slipper you
If I hadn’t come now
what would've happened?
I would've given this
to her and quietly gone
He would've given
this love letter it seems
Get up
You're signalling to her
and that too in English
Look what he’s doing, Pushpa
A whacko walked in saying
she's your girlfriend that day
We still welcomed her and
made her feel at home
When she reeled out
the Rangoon princess story...
...didn't we listen patiently?
But here you are
insulting my boyfriend!
You're still in school and want
a boyfriend plus a love letter?
How else will
your cheap mind work?
You're a creature who takes
freebie-briefs from your girlfriend
You're talking way too much
I’ll smash your teeth-
Why are you looking there?
You think this is a love letter?
Yes, it is
This is NCERT application form
Bro, take a look
Application form?
Then why this secrecy-
Thanks to your precious pet
Because he was so scared,
he called me from there!
If I'm in love, I'll bring
my boyfriend straight to mom
And introduce him
as my lover boldly
Pushpoo, I too love you
Get lost, you fatso
It was just a figure
of speech, you pumpkin!
Pushpa...?
Messing up my day
Hold this
I want coffee
Only here you push
your weight around
You and your jockey party
found skeletons you said
But your names are
missing in the paper
We didn't even
give any interviews
Open your eyes wide and read
It seems the commissioner himself
found the tree and dug underneath
That’s the news here
By the way you spun a yarn
there was a bullet on the forehead
But in this photo
I can’t see anything
Yarn, huh?
Take a look
See this bullet wound
Oh gawd! I can’t
sleep if I see all this
Commissioner sir,
this is Ashwin here
Madhumita’s frien-
Ashwin...tell me
I want to meet you urgently
I’m in the midst
of an enquiry now
I’ll be back in an hour
Come to my office
We’ll meet up
I’m commissioner Gopinath
I want to meet Madhumita
Regarding what, sir?
Sir, she came back only
this morning after the night shift
She’s tired and sleeping
She can’t be disturbed now
A closed file has been
reopened only because of her
I must interrogate her
Her health is our priority
I can’t wake her up now
I’ll let her know
you wanted to see her
Someone by name Ashwin
is here to see you
Come in, Ashwin
Take a seat
Tell me
Your name is headlines
in all the papers
Did you find it
all by yourself or-
Did Kali come in your dreams
and tell you where to dig?
Listen, Madhumita is
from a very affluent family
I didn’t want your names
dragged out in the open
That’s why I didn’t tell them
In the place we dug,
there’s something like a finger
There’s also a ring
with the initial R engraved
But none of the papers
this morning shows it
I want to clarify
1 more doubt
The 2 skeletons
are Kali and Kalyani
Then whom can
this ring belong to?
When did you take this photo?
I clicked it while
they were digging
Is it wrong, sir?
Did you share this
with anyone else?
No, sir
No one
Shivaraj...?
My phone, sir
Shivaraj, in the place
we dug yesterday...
...a finger and a ring
seem to be missing!
No, sir
It is-
What nonsense!
Don’t try to cover up
Sir, you were the one who-
You don’t seem to understand, Shivaraj
Because of the mud piled up
it could’ve rolled underneath
Search that area thoroughly again
Area is cordoned off, right?
Yes, sir
Search there at once
- Shivaraj?
- Yes, sir
Since it’s a railway station...
...passengers will be
walking up and down
So assign 2 constables
in that area for security
Listen, you must definitely find
that ring and the finger, okay?
What does this mean?
Why are you hiding it?
I can even tell you
whose finger it is
You see, Ashwin, if I had
given this photo to the press...
...then whoever murdered Kali
and Kalyani will be tipped off
We must nab
that killer with proof
I need your help
What’s your name now?
Kalyani
- Year?
Okay, you are Kalyani
Who is Kali?
Kali...he’s really weird
He won’t bow to anyone
His idea of justice and
fair play is so unique
No one can understand
his true nature immediately
He himself won’t know
when he’ll do what!
My father is coming back
this Sunday, that’s why, bro
Look over there
Hey you there!
Train is heading your way
Train...watch out
Bro, check if he’s still alive
Hey useless hooligan!
Look where he chose to die
Who the hell are you?
My dear precious pet!
You’re fine, right?
Don’t be scared
You escaped
Will I let you die so easily?
Get up
You are busy petting that stray cat
- My darling, sir
- Darling?
Poor baby!
She landed in
this track unknowingly
If I hadn’t seen her,
she would’ve died prematurely
But you’d also be
on the funeral pyre!
Sir, but she also has life, no?
Saving a bloody cat it seems
Don’t hit my precious!
Why waste time
with that lunatic?
They have hearts of stone!
Hey! Get off the track
You are sooooper, bro
You thought I’d lose the bet?!
Cough up the dough
I told you not to bet
with Kali bro about the cat
Why are you scowling?
Cough it up
Don’t...awwww!
Don’t hit me, ma
Good for nothing lout!
Don’t hit me
with a broomstick
- You’ll never reform
- What happened now?
You’ll save a silly cat
by sacrificing your own life
- You dirty scumbag!
- 'My fate to listen'
Don’t recite Bharathi’s poem
in this feeble timid way
Sing it with more
zeal and zest
Dad, that’s the only Ganesha
with a huuuge paunch
Get that for me, please
I’ll get it for you
- Uma dear
- Wow, ice
Why did you bunk yesterday?
You didn’t come
to clean the car!
There was a death anniversary
ceremony in our Judge’s house
Tomorrow full time
I’ll be in your place
He’s a Customs officer
Take good care of him
I know, Chella
Attend to your work
Bro, this is Chella here
Your drawings for writer Sujatha’s
story were simply superb
Thanks a lot, Swaminathan
I must start my prayers
before the inauspicious time
Don’t mistake me
I’ll take leave
Is it ready?
This wretched Vajram has come
to ruin our business now
Close the shop
Who cares about
headache or tablets!
That bloody murderer is here
Kalyani, let’s not
wait here...come
Greetings, bro
Who are you?
If you’re a Customs officer,
will you raid wherever you want?
Hey! First take the child away
Daddy...!
Why are you taking my daughter?
It's mistaken identity
I don’t know anything about this
Stop...stop...stop
Bharathi, is an elephant
chasing you or what?
A rowdy is killing
someone in that market
Vajram is killing someone
Spare him, bro
He’s no patch on you!
To squash an ant,
do you need an elephant?
On top of it,
6 -7 swines for support?
The equation isn’t right!
Did you cross his path
with some misdeed?
Do you know who he is?
Do you know his power?
You’ve done something wrong
I know that for sure
Okay, apologize to him
and do 3 sit ups
Do it now, man
Sorry...forgive me
That’s the way!
Bro has forgiven you
Leave this place now
Don’t look back
First beat him
black and blue
Hereafter there won’t be
any hassles in this market place
Vajram’s chapter is closed
Swaminathan...?
Please open the shutter
Give me the First aid kit
I was talking
to him just now
- What do we do now?
- Wound is so deep
All this ointment won’t do
Auto! Stop
Hospital-
Not a single chap is stopping
You carry on
I’ll bring a vehicle
Sir, stop the car
Hey! Don’t make a fus-
This ointment and bandage
won’t work for me
If I spit on it and leave it open
it’ll become fine automatically
(clears throat)
My mouth is dry
Why don’t you spit?
You have a tender heart
Gently...watch your step
Let him lie down on the seat
Push his feet inside
You also get in
The police will
call you as witness
Oh no! If it’s a court case
I can’t run around
Gokul Santol powder?
Scent is too good
Kalyani, come fast
Let's inform
Swaminathan’s family
Who was that girl
who tied the bandage?
Go, man
Clear off
Your shop is here, right?
Do you know who did this?
No
Hey old man!
Sir, I also arrived
the same time you did
I don’t know what
happened here, sir
Sir, I’ve got cataract
So can’t see a thing
I myself fumble my way through
Okay, go
Is this Gavaskar’s last match?
Greetings, sir
- What’s your name?
- Kali, sir
How did you get hurt?
My mother asked me to get
a clay Ganesha for the festival
I was on my way here
when that Vajram-
Sir, the same chap
who put that mark on you
I saw him coming
with his gang and armed
I got all jittery and
started running
As I was running I tripped
on an umbrella and fell down
I somersaulted
twice or thrice and fell
Tripped on an umbrella?
Yes, sir
Over there
You tripped over this?
I swear, sir
You saw the wound, right?
Okay...how did you
hurt your head?
Where I tripped there was a-
What?
Was there a wood apple?
On the dot, sir
You’re saying it as if
you were in that spot
All of you claim you didn’t
witness this murder
Did you at least
see him somersault?
We did, sir
You are all experts at making
a mountain out of a mole hill!
I don’t know
these couplets, sir
This is an age old proverb!
Send the body for postmortem
Okay, sir
“Hey hoodlum! Hooligan
You died all of a sudden”
“I marked a route, drew a line
On the line, road I designed”
“On the road I created a ruckus
To kill a rowdy made a rumpus”

“My mother feeds me a pancake
Gulp and gobble, take a break”

“What I was now I am not
I’ve changed a lot”
“Tiptop, top notch, bigwig
What’s your excuse to sing?”
I'll donate 1 more
bottle if you want
Why is she writing
A-B-C on it?
Let her specify the caste!
It might get mixed up
“Hooch brewed to the last drop
He drank it raw, stinking slob”
“Pledging household articles
Drinking liquor full bottles”
“Breaking your wife’s jaw
don’t ruin your life, bro!”
“If rich, go for branded ‘beedi’
If not, puff a smoked one, buddy”
“Smoke pot, coke, XTC
Snort to get high and dizzy”
“Get notorious easily
Ruining health unnecessarily”
“Getting married right royally
Setting up another stepney”
“Deserting wife on the sly
Leaving kids high and dry”
“Don’t live so shamelessly
You’ll lose respect in society”
“Rekha the bimbo, floozy
She’ll check you out snazzy”
“She’ll turn you into a crack
Get rid of her with tact”

Don’t you have sisters of your own?”
“Without any doubt
a dream girl will seek you out”
“Watch out for that beauty
Don’t switch your party”
“Ignored Parvathi
Didn’t give a damn to Malathy”
“Dumped Revathy
Gave a hard time to Gomathy”
“Glam dolls love riding piggyback
I slipped out like an eel with knack”

I became a sick patient”
“You sent me in a dizzy
Made me a nitwit, missy”

eye brows furrowing”
“Fresh flowers and ‘bindi’
Saree pleated neatly”
“Laid a trap with eyes inviting, hottie
I’m the boy who wants to play naughty”
“Your love to me
express quickly”
“If you don’t express here
I’ll be a corpse, my dear”
“Rowdy fellow!”
“Hey scoundrel slippery
Kicked the bucket in a hurry”
“I marked a route, drew a line
On the line, road I designed”
“On the road I created a ruckus
To kill a ruffian made a rumpus”
“Meenatchi the smelly disgrace
Ages since she washed her face”
“Not brushing her teeth daily
eats like a glutton, Kamatchi”
“Caught by such a specimen
you’ll stop breathing, man”
“Game of cards I gamble
My ma came to strangle”
“Roadside eatery serves breakfast
Break pots and pans, real blast”

Now I’m a big shot, oh yes!”
“Got my masters in crime
killing a gangster mastermind”
“No opponent for me
I’m a solo celebrity”
“What I was I’m not
I’ve now changed a lot”
You're bleeding!
If I spit on it and leave it open
it’ll become fine automatically
Spit
Doesn't matter...spit
Don't stamp the ‘kolam’
My girl’s handiwork
Welcome
I come
Sir, can I come in?
- You go in
- Good morning, sir
I’m also an artist, sir
Except my faces will be
lumpy and lopsided
But this is...wow!
A woman in front, a bald God man
at the back and Buddha right behind
3D look!
Super, sir
What can I do for you?
Till now I’ve never even looked up
at any female other than my mother
Who is he?
I just saw her
Don’t know why
I was mesmerized
I fell in love, so I thought
we should get married
Lord Shiva!
I’ll treat her
as gentle as a flower
Do you think you’re fair
in saying this?
I’m not planning to
kidnap your daughter!
Don’t we ask God
for things we don’t have?
Will God give it to us
at once generously?
Still, tomorrow I shouldn’t
feel bad I didn’t ask you
That’s why, I thought-
Who are you?
Who are we?
Do you mean caste, sir?
We belong to the same clan
You draw and paint, so do I
We are all human beings, right?
Fine, I’ll also become
like you if you so wish
Want me to sport a tuft?
I’ll oblige
Or should I wear huge beads
around my neck...?
Tell me what I should do
I’ll do that
Lord Shiva!
A tiger will only eat meat
How can a leopard change its spots?
You hit the nail
on the head, aunty!
You’re thinking you are vegetarian
and I am a non-vegetarian
I swear I’m also a vegetarian
I gave up non-veg long-
Hey! You’re here, huh?
Your father has a doubt
I’m clarifying it
You’ll say my blood
can’t be changed, right?
I’ll get hold of 10 robust boys
from your caste and go in for...
...blood transfusion
Full blood change
I’ll become ‘fure’!!
Have you come here
to make trouble?
Aiy-
Kali, they are in a totally
different league altogether
Let’s go
Hey! It isn't what you think, Chella
I like his daughter
She also has
a soft corner for me
I’m here to ask
for her hand formally
If I am not favoured
‘get out’ is all I need
But the ‘get out’ should come
from your daughter, Murthy sir
Because we are both above 18
Let her decide
I’m reminded of you
day in and day out
Whatever I do,
you haunt me here
I’ll take care of you
like a princess
If you like me, you don’t even
have to express it, my dear
Just lift your head
That’s enough
Otherwise just say no
with your head bent
I’ll say ‘bye’ and leave
After that even if I walk
down your street...
...you can use whatever
cuss words you know and hit me
Look at Tamil poet Bharathi
Isn’t he known for his famous song
“There isn’t any caste or creed”
Only the turban is missing
We share the same moustache
Think and then lift your head slowly
Finiss...Finnis!
So Murthy sir, will you fix
an auspicious date or shall I?
If my mother gets to know
she’ll flash her 32 teeth...
...and come rolling here!
You didn’t believe me
when I told you, did you?
Imagine if someone has
fallen even for my face-
What, my dear?
Listen to me
You don’t have to sport a tuft
or convert to vegetarianism
Or have blood transfusion
You just be yourself, enough
But you have murdered a man
She’s being really funny now!
When he came to kill
that poor officer...
...weren’t you right there?
Why didn’t you prevent me,
like Gandhi’s ahimsa mode?
I tried to prevent
They tried to kill me too
If everyone’s life is precious...
...my life isn’t to me, huh?
So I closed his chapter
Who came forward as witness?
Didn’t the policemen
burst crackers and rejoice?
What I did was only
with best of intentions
Let the law say so
Can you accept your crime?
Can you surrender?
Let the Court decide what to do
You come out a clean man
If I do, will you marry me?
Huh?
I’ll wait for you
She’s trying to bury you
Don’t get fooled
There are so many holes up there
What will they do when it rains?
Why did you call me, Kali?
Just a small matter, sir
I wanted to-
Aren’t you Murthy?
What’s the problem?
No problem, sir
I just have to surrender
For what?
Didn’t I kill Vajram?
What is this, sir?
I didn’t say-
Only after Kali showed up
this area is crime-free
I can also go home early
and sleep in peace
I didn’t-
Sir, he isn’t involved
I’m surrendering voluntarily
If I do something wrong
I should be punished, right?
Handcuff me, sir
Don't be insane!
Sir, cuff me
It'll look stylish
Visiting my in-laws
has made me an out-law!
Let’s go
Okay?
You’ll keep your word?
I’ll be back soon
Sir...sir, stop
Greetings, sir
Are we here at a good time?
Auspicious time, sir
Come...welcome
Greetings!
We were flooded
with so many offers
He has seen your daughter
somewhere it seems
He’s so insistent he will
marry only your daughter
- Mom...!
- Please take a seat
Murthy sir
Let us see the bride
I repeatedly told you
like teaching a parrot
Didn’t it enter
your thick skull?
Why the hell can’t you get ready?
You want me to deceive the boy
who is sitting in jail trusting me?
Don’t do anything drastic
I have to take care
of your younger sister
I shouldn’t be humiliated
by the people known to us
You don’t have to
worry about all this
Go ahead and marry him
Father...!
We can get married at
the earliest auspicious date
Don’t worry about expenditure
I’ll make all the arrangements
Glad to hear that
Kali, something urgent it seems
Our hopes are all
dashed to the ground
Why do you have a face
fit for a funeral?
Don’t be upset with me
We should choose a bride
befitting our face
She packed you off to jail
And set herself up
with a wealthy man?
Tomorrow morning
is the wedding it seems
Kali...what happened?
Move...move aside
Kali?
He is escaping
Sound the alarm
Kali...wait
Don’t do this
I made you comfortable here
You’ll be released in 1 week
Don’t ruin it
You won’t understand
I have to go
Listen to me
Don't show your rowdy side!
You said you’ll wait for me
You left me in the lurch
If someone comes tip top
and moneyed, that’s it, huh?
You’ve got it all wrong
I’m not for this wedding
and I don’t like the groom
My father threatened to
swallow poison and die
He forced me to agree
I’ll marry him like a zombie
Is that true?
Oh God! I heard
what I shouldn’t have
Kalyani, what is wrong
with you, huh?
After coming this far and
we are to be married tomorrow
- Why were you silent, Kalyani?
- My father didn’t let me
You could have at least told me
Tell me now
Do you really love this-
Hey!
Do you love him?
Tell me
Something unforeseen may happen if
you are here, let’s leave this place
Don’t think too much
Please, I’ll help you
Kali...?
Kiran, Madhu has come
for her session now
Whatever she says
can’t be made into a game
She is rambling about
a Kali, Kalyani and Ravi
Radhi, what state
is Madhu in now?
In a hypnotic state
Must wake her up only now
They uploaded 3 new games
from our Bangalore unit
CPU overload
When the chase gets
too competitive...
...like a dog sticking her tail
in between her legs
...the machine went for a toss
Just check it please
Nothing to worry
IC got burnt in the overload
Shall I check now?
Deadline is zooming in!
Be with me please
till I finish testing
Move
All these are Madhu’s illusions
She told me about this
Did Madhu design this game?
No...no
Kiran's concept
Designing was completed
in our Bangalore office
And only this morning
he uploaded the trial version
This one?
Meera left this half done
This was also
fine tuned by our boss
What bloody crap this is!
It’s a very cheap game
Worldwide such games
are only popular
From ages 7 to 77
all our addicts
They let out their bottled up
frustrations by playing these games
Our company designs
such crappy games?
You know how much profit
international companies make?
We have also kept this ready
as an underground project
All this is courtesy
corporate hand out
Didn’t Meera jump down several
floors just like this rape game?
Why do you reopen closed chapters?
I shouldn't have called you
There’s something fishy about this
Don’t disturb me
Meera used to take this?
Your girl also takes
All of us in our department
take these capsules
For what?
It gives you such a high, the brain
will break its control and enlarge
New ideas will cascade like waterfall
Otherwise how can we
come up with all this?
Dr Radhika prescribes them
Bought by our company
Simply super
Madhu...?
Madhumita
Kalyani
I’m Kalyani
Okay, fine
You are Kalyani
Ravi saw you and Kali
in the wedding hall
Then what happened?
'Ravi called us out
pretending to help us'
'Kali was hesitant'
Why are you hesitating?
I’ll help you
Don't think too much
'So I decided and
we both followed him'
Your son-in-law is
not an ordinary man
He’s smarter than
a smart cookie!
Customs raid in your
son-in-law’s TV company
The officers poked and probed
dissecting us to bits and pieces
Mr Ravi, you got license
to import oranges
And you’ve been busy
smuggling picture tubes
You’ve cheated the Govt
That officer couldn’t be bribed
He shut down and
sealed the company
Will your son-in-law spare him?
He paid Vajram
to kill the officer
Kali came in between and
threw a spanner in the works
Hey Swaminathan
How are you feeling now?
Traitor...!
This isn’t ‘dharma’ at all
You can see if that ‘dharma’
saves your head now!
1 twist of the head, sir
He got his ticket to heaven
in that single moment
Your son-in-law
will come up tops
'Go before anyone sees you'
Your daughter is
his lucky mascot
You will also do well in life
Ka-
How can you both be so dumb?
Kalyani?
Stop...stop the car
Where are you going?
Stop
Where is Kali?
Tell me the truth
He wouldn’t have done
anything wrong, sir
Don’t do anything to him
Ask him to surrender
Otherwise...no one
can save him
Why has he brought us here?
- Where to?
- Follow me
Bombay Mail waits here for
a few minutes for the signal
You can board it and
live happily ‘ever after’
You have such a golden heart
Even I’m not so good hearted
Can you lend me some money?
I’ll return it through money order
- Thanks a ton
- For what?
You saved us like God
Like God...me?
Don’t put me on a pedestal
I am an ordinary man
Jealousy, anger, vengeance and
all that crap come naturally to me
Like any other human being
But He...the idiot!
He’ll forgive wrong doers
But I’m not God
I shoot to kill
That’s me
Is this why you brought us
to this Godforsaken place
This 'tubelight'
is slow on the uptake
In a wedding hall, with 100s of guests
as witnesses, I can only get married
What has he got that’s lacking in me?
You are going overboard with
your words and crossing limits
How is ‘sir’?
If he can get you to elope
he must be a smooth operator!
He must have given you
immense pleasure?!
Hey...I praised you just now
with my words still in my throat
You stink like garbage!
I’ll slice your tongue
Thanks to your 'union', in 8 months
your junior will be delivered
Should I carry the ‘father’ title?
- Hey!
- Stop there
Please stop
What are you doing?
Let go, you old man
Is this the way to
bring up your daughter?
She has loved a scumbag and
you tried to palm her off on to me
Kali...don’t
Let him go
Imagine our plight
if you murder him?
You’ll be fine
Don’t worry
I’ll take you to the hospital
Kali...!
Don’t shoot
Sleazeball!
Scumbag!
If I spit on it and leave it open
it’ll become fine automatically
I spared him
only because of you
Your Ahimsa principle!
You’ll die only in my hands
Come and save us
I can’t open my eyes
Mud in my mouth
I can’t breathe
Madhu...calm down
I'm suffocated
Madhu
You remember the year 1987
But you weren’t even born then
Did someone
tell you this story?
- Father?
- Sundaram...?
You said your dad died
when you were 10
I meant Kalyani’s father
Murthy
He draws for magazines
Ask her if Murthy is still alive?
You said Ravi killed Murthy
No, he didn’t die
He is alive
'I took an active part
in NSS when I was in school'
'We were involved in
a lot of social work'
'We went to
an Old age home'
'We helped the elders there'
'We used to write letters'
'Take them out for
a walk in the garden'
'And play with them'
What, grandpa?
Kalyani?
Let go of my hand
After he buried you alive...
...how did you escape
from that brute?
I’m not Kalyani
Murthy, let go of her hand
He was hurt and unconscious
near a railway station
They brought him here
He was in coma
for many years
After he regained consciousness
no one understood what he said
He’ll always be sketching
He hardly talks to anyone
It’s a wonder he spoke to you
Don’t hit me
Madhu, have you
told this to anyone?
'I told the warden'
You shouldn’t take
any of this seriously at all
That grandpa claims
he himself shot Gandhi
He’ll keep asking us to hang him
They are here because
they ramble like this
Just listen, ignore
and move on
I forgot all this
Sweetheart?
Do you know where Murthy is now?
Kiran, don’t butt in
I’m interrogating her, right?
Do you know where Murthy is?
You shouldn’t interrupt
a session forcibly like this
Goody-goody
All of a sudden
Wrong...I gave
all these illegal tablets
I medicated your office staff
All for your sake
Bloody...!
Ravi...?!
Murderer?
You are the man
she was talking about?
Okay, dear
Take all this off
And show me where he is
I won’t tell you
Erase all records and finish her
Check Madhu’s biodata
Find out from her school
all the Old age Homes she visited
I need the list
Doctor, where's Madhu?
Kiran took her
forcibly with him
Ashwin?
Where has Kiran taken Madhu?
I don’t know
Kiran won’t spare me
He will kill me
Why should he kill you?
I know all that he did
He was anxious to develop thrilling
video games within a tight deadline
I gave all these drugs
listening to him
By stimulating the minds
of so many youngsters...
...I've ruined their lives
I followed Kiran's orders
Call the Police
Send the cops to 'Let's talk'
a psychiatric clinic near Tidel Park
What happened?
My boss Kiran has kidnapped Madhu
And tried to kill the doctor here
Car key
He might have a motive to kill you
But why kidnap Madhu?
Listen to this
You’ll get all your answers
Okay
You’re Kalyani
Who is Kali?
“When I try to touch the horizon
I realize it’s a mere illusion”
“It even slides into oblivion”
“Like the horizon’s distance
You seem close this instance”
“But when I come near
you vanish into thin air”
“Steady heart set on fire
Dreams seared on a pyre”
“Before you melt, my life dear
will I see you I wonder?”
“Like dew drops on leaves tender
here and there we meander”
“When the wind blows, we scatter
Honey, with golden honey flavor”
“Most painful distress is love’s suffering
Even more heartless than life’s offering”
“Away from you in darkness
I melt into blankness”
“I bury myself into
the endless sky so blue”
“Heart’s core torched
Dreams to cinders scorched”
“Before you melt into oblivion,
love, will I meet you again?”
“Like dew drops on leaves tender
here and there we meander”
“When the wind blows, we scatter
Honey, with golden honey flavor”
“Love wrings, throttling me
Tears as rivulets run untiringly”
“To remember is a pain, forget is in vain
Life is an elongated emotional strain”
“Like a raindrop lost in a dense forest
why have you also gone, my dearest”
“Like the root gravitates to water
Girl, I’ll reach you wherever”
“When eyes close tight
I see a hundred hues bright”
“Again when eyes open wide
world becomes zero outside”
“Though away for a little while
you lamented big time volatile”
“For many births do you know
how a girl’s heart echoes in sorrow?”
I’m sure they are Kiran’s men
Madam, come out
My leg is stuck inside
Look there, Ashwin
Welcome back to reality!
Just you re-lax...relax
You are heavily sedated!
You aren’t fully
conscious as yet
- You are a killer
- No...shh...sshhh!
Why are you looking at me so tensed?
You know you can’t do
anything to me with this bottle!
Come here...oh my God
You even smell and
feel like my Kalyani
Please leave me
How am I to blame
for all this?
How many...?
When you first walked into
my office for an interview
That was your 1st mistake!
The same Kalyani I saw
25 years ago...same face
Felt like you came out alive
from the same place I buried you!
I was shell shocked
But I was so happy
to see you everyday
Then came the shocker!
You also gave that Ashwin
first aid...what?
3 guys to bring
this bag of bones!
Oh my God!
Think of the devil
and here he comes
That’s when I saw him again
Outside the lift
Oh yes...I know...he isn't Kali
Neither are you Kalyani
But you could have
been born elsewhere
Could have gone anywhere
But you didn’t!
This fellow also could have
been born or lived elsewhere
But even he didn’t!
What did you both do?
Came back to me
Back to my domain!
Like pressing all over again
the pause button of 1987
You both resumed your love cycle
Every time I saw you
a spear pierced my heart
I tried to kill him
in a car accident
But his good fortune
he escaped that day!
Today your fate is
playing a game in my form
You cheated Kalyani
and murdered her
Hey! I was cheated
I got cheated
Not Kalyani!
I didn’t get married
after that...no...!
So many girls have crossed my life
like passing clouds...that’s it
The next morning I won’t remember
their name, face, profile...nothing!
But a wife is different
With respect...sex aside
Everything can be
shared in one’s life
I was so happy I got
a Kalyani to share it with
But my dream was shattered!
Kali tried to run away with Kalyani
As a man I tried to stop it
And did it
I killed
Then every bloody stranger
on the road asked me...
...why the girl I was supposed
to marry eloped with a rowdy!
Slap on my face!
I was humiliated
Again and again and again
How many times!
Ashwin, please don’t
leave me again and go
Classic love stories
that stood the test of time
...have always ended in tragedy!
You’re a monster...demon!
No, I am the devil
Please leave me
Oh no! I can’t
You are the only 2 people alive
who know my secrets inside out
As you know, I’m the only one
in our company who decides...
...how every game should end!
Now this game is
also under my control
This also, I’ll only decide
how this should end
Wondering how a guy
who fainted got up?
You’re cheating the whole world
So I thought
I should lightly-
Mr Ravi Kiran...?
I thought she was
a fool all these days
But you seem to be
a bigger fool than her!
You could’ve finished her
in the clinic itself
But you didn’t and
brought her here
Mistake number 1
Your boys could’ve shot me
They brought me
and dropped me here
What a bunch of idiots!
That’s mistake number 2
At least when we united here
together, you could’ve shot us
But you didn’t!
Again and again and again,
you were going in circles
...rattling away your dialogs
and wasting time
So tiring, man!
Fate has a hand in your game
In my form
He became loony
because you hit him
Nab him
Hey Madhu...come out
Your boyfriend is about to die
And you are hiding...?
What kind of love is this?
Your Romeo’s life
is dangling in mid-air!
Oh yes...just 1 more twist
And your Romeo’s chapter is closed
I love it, my dear
What are you looking at?
I’m practical
If I kill him and go to jail,
what will happen to Madhu?
I want to live with her
Spend my lifetime with her happily
For 25 years he has
covered up his murderous past
Just shoot him
and close the case, sir
Law will take its course
Now I’ll arrest and take him
Sir, he’ll use his power
and come out in a flash
We don’t have any kind of
strong evidence against him
Shoot him, sir!
First drop that knife, Ashwin
If we spare his life he won’t
let us live...kill him!
Don’t listen to her
Kill him
Drop the knife
Don’t spoil your future
Drop the knife
Ashwin, don’t...throw it away
Kill him
Kali..?
Hey...!
'Your death is in my hands'
You’ll die because of him
Hey, stop blabbering
Will you shut up for a while?
Using my own idea on me?
Remember
Death...is not the end
I will come back for you
For you to come back and play
is this a video game?
Ravi Kiran tried to kill
all his witnesses...
...in order to cover-up
his murders 25 years ago
When we tried to track
his cell phone to arrest him...
...he committed suicide!
In the Old age Home also-
If you spit and dry it in the air,
it’ll automatically heal
Madhu, please sign this check
150 million?!
Music by Harris Jeyaraj
Dance by Nayanthara
Dinner for 3000
in a 5 star hotel
The whole city should sit up
for my dear niece's wedding, right?
Okay, why is it your hands
are forever in your pocket?
What’s the secret?
Our Guruji has said if you
keep rotating a lemon...
...it drives away bad vibes
and is good for the family
At least now you shared
this blessed secret!
This place has changed so much
Do you remember, Ashwin in 1962,
before boarding the ship...
...we ran down this road?
There were many
check posts here
Ashwin, are you mad to bring her
to Burma for your honeymoon?
How many times do I tell you?
Previous life and rebirth
are all bunkum and bull!
I saw you for the 1st time
in the lift, in our office
In this birth, before that day
I’ve never set eyes on you
Then how were you etched
in my Burma memories?
This I can explain
Not only in your dreams, darling
But in every young girl’s dream
in the whole of Tamil Nadu...
...I’ll make my guest appearance
Ashwin exclusively comes
even in Hindi girls’ dreams too!
With your bamboo stick body
don’t get too greedy
Oh yeah, you’re teak wood!
How many ever births we take,
I won’t love any other man
And you won’t live
with any other woman!
Listen, if you keep talking
about past births...
...I’ll settle down with
these egg-headed seers!
Yeah...you’ll be celibate, huh?!
Can you sleep without me?
That’s the only reason...
...I’ve been tolerating
all the stories you reel out!
