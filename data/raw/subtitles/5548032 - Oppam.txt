Things can be fixed as discussed,
can't we, Jayaraman?
When my Uncle is here, l have no say, right?
Being the head of the family, l'll give the word!
But if you try to back-off
at the nick of the moment...
then, l will take back my words!
lt's you who should take care of the things
here.
We are just going to execute the decision taken
by the boy and the girl who love each other.
-That's all-Yes that's all
A girl from your family
coming to our family is itself the biggest wealth!
Still, all the formalities have to be finalized,
right?
Everything will be done as promised.
Go ahead and fix an auspicious date.
That bugger is coming.
l guess he may botch this proposal!
So everything as discussed and finalized!
Just inform us after fixing an auspicious date
-Please hold.-No need
Blindness has never been an obstacle for my
brother!
ln fact, he knows the
surroundings better than us.
lsn't Lakshmi here?
-Yes, brother.-Come here.
-Are you happy?-Yeah
Don't worry, this brother will
take care of everything..okay.
Did l ask him to pledge this house
and land for Bhaputty?
lt's not a meager sum.
But l lent him around 25 lakhs!
Now it's almost 2 years.
The Principal and interest amount mounted
now.
There is no way for income at all
Either you repay my debt or
l will sell this house and land.
and l'll give the balance amount, if any left
Nothing more to say. Move.
Aunty, Gomathy's chain and bangles are in this.
Return them.
l saw you agreeing to all
the demands of groom's family.
But l have not seen this girl adorned
with gold ornaments of her own.
Going with our family status,
ls it possible for you to perform this marriage
in a simple way at least?
l already explained my plight.
l'm a bit tight now.
As if only now!
Don't you know, Madhavan,
When his father Ramunni passed away,
Jayaraman was only 20 yrs old.
Kannan 10 yrs and Lakshmi was 7.
By cleaning temple premises, beating drums,
he educated both of them.
Even now, the monthly expenses are met ,
with rent amount from the shop
he acquired with great difficulty.
-No, aunty.. - You keep quiet.
Don't waste time talking old stories!
Try to reach home before dark.
Everybody has their own hardships!
The only thing that this family
has now is this house and land!
When pledged them for someone else's sake,
nobody has any complaints, right?
Has anyone?
Get me something to eat!
Next month, Varghese will lock the house.
We'll have to leave from there.
Haven't you told Groom's family,
one share of the property belongs to Lakshmi?
Baputty and me are childhood friends.
When he had an urgent need, l helped him.
As you have no family,
you can live on streets also, brother.
What about us?
Baputty will not cheat me.
Last month also, l spoke to him.
He promised to repay this debt
as soon as he returns from Doha.
Going back home?
Oh Kunjanja, anything caught in the bait?
No! l'm sitting since morning.
Time is 7 '0 clock!
lt'll take another 10-15 minutes
forthe boat to come!
Give me the fishing rod. Let me give a try.
Panicker, you are too bad.
You promised to come to Kalari
to show martial arts to children.
ln fact, l had come there.
When you were dancing in front of an English
woman,
l went back.
Hey Kuruppu, this Kalari and Kathakali
are both a part of our culture
This art was created by our ancestral gurus
after years of research in the human anatomy
lf the body wants to be an eye, the martial steps
should be thoroughly learnt
from childhood itself
This cannot be created
in a capsule model by creating publicity,
after taking photo of Old English woman orfilm
actress in kalari attire and
putting in the facebook page.
One who's learnt Kalari,
should be conscious enough to notice,
even the blink of an eye!
Like this!
lt's a stingy catfish ah!
How did you know?
l can feel in the rod from its throb!
My Goodness! Where were you?
''Smell of Camphor is coming, O Wind!''
O Priest! Where are you going?
Oh you, Raman! l didn't see you!
lt's me who can't see you,
but what's the problem with you?
lt's long time since he borrowed Rs.2000 from
me!
So even if he doesn't notice me,
l can't blame him.
That's right!
l will repay it immediately
l'll give it to your younger brother next week.
-lt's an utter lie - What?
That Jayaraman is blind.
He can see everything. Simply cheating people.
-Where are you going, Gopaletta? -
Chottanikara!
Navarathri is ahead!
lt's been a long time since l listened to
Neelambari!
Listening to Sandhya Ragam
(Tune of the Twilight) is a feast for the ears!
You're right! Won't it take a long time to reach
Kochi?
Why don't we sing, then?

Sorry!
Rs.50!
Papa asked to change the bulb!
Don't worry, l will get the electrician tomorrow.
-Where are you going? - Tuition.
- Did you arrange the money?-No!
How much do you have to give?
-How much?- l need at least Rs 26 !
Just that! Couldn't you ask me?
What, 26 lakhs?!
Oh my God! Lakhs?
Or would anybody pledge a house for Rs.26?
ls it like that in Malapuram area?
Tell me the truth, were you a sweeper
in the army?
No wonder how these Chinese
captured all our places.
How will you arrange such a big amount?
Don't keep harping on it.
l will have to hand overthis in each house.
ls Devayani around here to hand over this?
-Didn't you know that? - What?
-Entire Police force came to her house!-What?
Her ex-husband, Majid,
ls Majid, Devayani's husband?
lt's Madhu!
l don't know his name.
He and one of his police friends
went into her house in inebriation
and created nuisance.
Then?
Her brother, what is his name...
Name not necessary, come to the point,
-He brandished with what he got in his hand!
-Really? Then?
That fellow fled away.
Seems that Policeman broke his head..
..Killed or almost dying..Heard so!
Situation worsened.
Police team went to Bangalore
in search of her brother.
As they couldn't nab him,
they detained Devayani.
Atlast she was freed
only after ourJudge interfered.
-Good morning, Jayaram bro!
- Good morning, Ramesh!
Who eats all this stuff at crack of dawn?
Would like to know Uncle's plan!
You have FD of 1 Crore rupees in the Bank.
Why can't you give him 25 lakhs from that?
lsn't he your only nephew?
Moreover, you neither have a family nor a child!
Yes, he has a daughter!
lf public knows, Justice Krishnamoorthy's
honour will fly in the air!
lt's not from his legal affair, right?
That's the reason for concealing it.
Don't everthink of giving ourfamily property
to the child from an extramarital affair!
Sister, l've told you several times
not to come here for discussing such things.
Come, mother.
Oh, you've come!
What's that Jayraman?
Few ripened mangoes!
Don't you know l shouldn't take sweets?
You can eat this adding some curd to it!
Nothing will happen.
Such mangoes are not available
anywhere now.
-The incident happened to her ...
-l came to know...
Kunjakka told me.
l'm leaving. Your lunch is kept in the fridge.
l will try to reach at the time of lunch.
l will take care.
You need to go to many more flats, right?
Don't lose yourjob offending people.
Handover this in Sardarji's house.
And this forAdvocate madam.
Pillaichettan's shop will be closed for 3 days.
lf you give me this month's provision list,
shall get them before dusk.
lf Secretary doesn't see me
in the lift after 6 ' 0 clock,
he will start barking.
Will give you the list tomorrow.
Then, we need to set out for one more journey.
When shall we go, sir?.
As you are piled up with work here,
l have to see your convenience also.
Blind school Principal, RK Nair..l met him.
One of my old friends.
Seems you are teaching Music
for the children there.
Just like that! lt's fun to be with children.
And also to impart whatever l learnt.
lt will be useful forthem.
Principal is trying to making yourjob,
permanent there.
lf that is done, quit this lift operatorjob.
l've just come. No problem here.
l've told you the plans, right?
Okay! No one will know.
See you in the evening. Love you.
What time are you coming for work?
What is the problem?
Not even a day, he was punctual for work.
Comes up with different excuses every day.
What is the excuse for today?
Yourfatherjumped into the well?
Henceforth, if you come
with any excuses in the morning,
You will be thrown out of yourjob!
Understood?
l'm leaving for hometown.
Will return only after 30 days.
Here is the key.
Call someone from workshop and disconnect
my Car's battery.
Get it cleaned once in a while.
Give the key in my office.
Jayaram, tell to check the pipe on the 4th floor.
Somewhere there is a block! Heard me?
You have enough work here, right?
Don't keep chatting!
Wash the Car and go to school.
Team DrC
lf it's for such a long journey,
we could've taken a driver.
No Jayaraman, this journey will lead
to my last stage of investigation.
l need to handle with care.
Shouldn't involve any 3rd person from outside!
-Sir, lottery tickets. 5 Crores is the Bumper!
-No, please.
-One Karunya(Mercy) ticket please! - No.
-Sir, please..this is the first sale
-Okay, give me one.
Now, you will have to
show some mercy towards me!
You know where is Shrank Bhaskar's house?
Shrank?
Sir, you mean the person
who hacked Amberi Achu to death.
l'm not sure whether he hacked him.
But he was sentenced to a life imprisonment.
Then, he is the person.
Go straight, you will find a pipe on the road
side.
Straight opposite to it, is the house.
Sir, that is the house.
- Baskaran?-Hmm! Who are you?
Don't you know Vasudevan, yourjail mate?
l would like to know some details about him.
Come Nandana, let's go.
Sir, is anybody following us?
No!
While we were going there,
coming here and also now,
did the same vehicle go past us?
Did you notice it, sir?.
You must have felt so, Jayraman!
What happened?
Just like that l asked.
For a long time, l've been travelling
along with you to many places.
But till now, you didn't
even ask a word about it.
Yeah, l have not asked you a word about it, sir.
Also about Nandinimol.
l've got many questions in my mind.
''What is the need to hide your daughter and
live?''
''Who is her mother''
''Why making her call me as Ramaacha''
''Why making me tell lies for all her questions''
And these journeys...?
Like these, l got 1000 questions in my mind.
But l didn't ask you anything.
You know why, sir?
One shouldn't know what
he's not supposed to know
Or will know only when he is destined so!
l thought so.
This mindset of yours is what
created a bond between us!
That doesn't exist even in a blood relationship!
But now l feel it's time to
disclose certain things to you.
lt was around 10 - 14 yrs back,
l was a High Court Judge then.
One youth, Vasudevan was presented
before me for a murder case!
One Mr.Appu Master's son!
He was an accountant in a Sait's company.
Case was Vasudevan raped and killed the
maid of Sait's house.
Before the verdict,
he requested for a personal talk in my
Chamber.
With an outburst of tears,
he claimed he was innocent!
Being a Judge, l can't turn
a blind eye to evidences, can l?
l sentenced him with life imprisonment.
Later, because of dire situation and shame,
that Master's family, including his wife,
7 members consumed poison and committed
suicide.
Something provoked me to go to that spot.
Over there, l saw him standing
along with the Policemen.
He had flaring eyes
which can burn down the entire World.
Condemning for the grave crime,
he pointed his finger at me.
He murmured something.
Before those heaps of corpses, the tug of War
between Law, Justice and Conscience..
rocked my mind very badly!
Still l've not overcome from it!
A few years later, l got retired from
Supreme Court and settled in hometown.
l went to Jail enquiring about him.
By then he was released after serving the
sentence.
From there l came to know that,
ln the shock of seeing the dead bodies of his
family,
he became a mental patient.
Then, nearly forfour years,
he was in the mental hospital.
Vasu who returned to Jail after the treatment,
Before walking out from there,
he had scribbled something in the prison,
l read them.
Behind those Crazy lines ,
there was some strong inner meaning!
As an atonement for my guilt, with a hope
that l can give him a better life again,
l started searching for Vasu for some more
years.
l just wished to see him...
wanted a chance to tell him
lt is that investigation which is going on even
now!
Team DrC
What does the Post mortem report say?
-Was he drunk?-Report doesn't say so
Reason for death says,
the impact of falling from top!
There are no other reasons to prove
it's not a suicide.
Then why was this case sent to crime branch
saying the relatives are creating a ruckus!
But there is an interesting point in that FlR.
What is that?
The footprints found on the spot where he
jumped was not that of the shoes he wore!
That belongs to somebody else.
That may be, of the one who pushed him down.
-lf so, shouldn't there be signs of a struggle!
- Hmm!
l guess you are being transferred!
Yes! Today is my last day here.
This is a case l was investigating.
Nobody entrusted this to me. l did it on my
interest.
lf you are interested, you can continue.
All details are in this.
These deaths occurred at 5 different spots.
1st death was Kozhikode Karthik Sait's
Died of gas cylinder blast on last Diwali.
That's in October.
Next, DYSPAhmed and wife, who
were returning from Mambaram Church festival,
died when Car fell into the river.
Then, one doctor Joseph Charlie and his wife,
died of a boat accident in Thekkady.
See this,
retired Public Prosecutor Nambiar,
drowned in Aluva river!
l was probing only that case.
See this.
lT student who came back from US
after completing his studies
Vijayakrishnan, only son of deceased Nambiar,
jumped from his flat terrace and committed
suicide.
That Case is on your head, now.
Nambiar who drowned and died was highly
inebriated.
So not sure whether it was an accident or
suicide.
Just a week after that was his son's death!
But relatives say they had no problems
emotionally or financially!
Not even a suicide note was found from both of
them.
All these incidents happened
in different places at different times in Kerala!
Why do you interlink all this?
All of them died along with their entire family
Also index fingers were cut off from all the
deceased.
Based on the nature of death, nobody noticed
it.
You think somebody is behind this?
That is the reason l investigated this case.
There are some more details in this file.
Better burn it sir! Don't get into trouble.
Hey Beeran!
Oh God! l told you 100 times,
l'm Veeran and not Beeran
We are calling the same God as Allah, Jesus
and Ayyappa!
So what's wrong in calling you so!
Do you call mother as father
and father as mother?
Forget it.
lsn't a flat locked on the 11th floor?
So what?
l doubt seeing a shadow in that room yesterday
On that floor?.
No way! That must be Devayani.
She is been entrusted to
clean a couple of locked flats.
Does she clean at midnight?
Won't she leave at 6 p.m?
-Mightjust be your imagination!. - Don't scare
me also.
Are you talking about the 11th floor or 6th
floor?
lf you ask me so, then l will get confused.
lrony is he doesn't even remember people's
names, then what to say about floor !
On 6th floor, 605 is vacant.
That flat is for rent out - for Military man, right?
When l was returning
after giving betel leaf to its adjacent flat,
l heard some movements in that flat.
l knocked on the door, then
there were no movements.
Really a bad situation!
Those times we got chances of knowing
our neighbours well.
When the flat system came, people
just sit at locked doors.
Nobody knows who our neighbour is,
whether he is Jaffer, Sherif or Mohammad!
What happened? Any problem here?
Sardarji's daughter is missing.
She left for beauty parlour at 5 p.m
But she didn't show up there!
Her phone is also switched off!
Someone check for her in Marine Drive.
Why over there?
Kiss of Love protest takes place there only
Don't talk nonsense.
No, l really mean it.
-That Menon's son.. - you mean Ravi?
Yeah, l saw him and Sardarji's daughter doing
Kissing of love protest in the Car park!
l will call you the next time.
Although you will not be able to see,
you can at least listen to its sound.
That girl normally goes by Scooty, is it?
Yes!
Check if her vehicle is there..
Yes! Let me check.
May be partying with some friends!
Someone call up her friends' houses and
check.
About which Mohammed are you talking about?
Mohammed?! We are talking about Sardaji's
daughter.
Hell with him!
Scooty is here.
Kunjakka come here.
Sardarji, everyone come with me.
-Get 605 room's key from Menon sir. - Ok
Why you need to open this? Nobody is inside.
Someone is inside. Open the door.
Who will be inside the locked room?
What's wrong in opening the door?
Please open and check.
What should l do next?
Any one get inside and check.
Who are you looking for?.
Hey you!
All of you please sit. Please sit.
Association needn't decide about my son's
marriage.
Your son has made a grave mistake to my
daughter.
This will turn to big turmoil here!
Let me give you a good decision.
Krishnamoorthy sir, we are not suggesting
anything.
You are highly a reputable person in the
Society!
Obviously, your decision will always be a fair
one.
No sir, you will have to tell a decision in this.
lt's not enough if you alone say
Only if everybody agrees, l will tell my opinion.
lt's the matter of their lives.
They have the
age, rights and wisdom to decide about it.
Needn't get afraid of anyone
Speak openly.
-Do you love her? - Yes
What about you?
Hmm!
Do you wish to marry and lead a happy life?
So you mean to say parents have no rights
to decide about their children's life!
Two different places, languages, customs
traditions and people!
How does it match?
Definitely it will end up in divorce.
Times are different now, Menon.
Both of you should understand one thing.
Nowadays, whether you buy a dog, cow or a
horse,
they will have their own pedigrees!
l mean the lineage!
Jegveer sing's family is an elite family.
And yours is also the same, Menon!
These children also have that lineage
Only that is needed, Menon.
Both of you come to my flat this evening,
along with your families.
We will arrive at a final decision there.
Team DrC
Hey!
Hey, stand there!
Sorry!
l got something to tell you.
What's it, sir?
-l saw him.-Who?
A person like Vasu!
Like Vasu?
No! He is Vasu!
Before l could talk anything, he walked away.
Then?
You..
You need to go to Nandini's place immediately.
Apart from the number given by you,
Even if you call me,
l will not talk about Nandini! Enough?
That's enough! Thank you!
-Good morning! - Good morning!
Your Ramachhan has come! Both of you have a
good weekend.
What is wrong with you, Ramachhan?
Who will abduct this abandoned child?
Who told that you are an abandoned child?
This Ramachhan needs you!
There's nothing wrong, if people call you a liar!
Why?
lf you'v e no eye sight, then
how did you catch the ball?
-Oh! That is a trick! - To hell with your trick!
What all lies you told me?
You will bring my father and mother. All white
lies!
Earlier when you gave me balloons
and chocolates,l believed your words.
Now this Nandini is not a kid, you know?
Really? This poor Ramachhan didn't know,
that Nandini dear has grown up!
You know why l don't ask you anything now/
lf l ask you more questions and corner you,
then, fearing me, if you also avoid coming here,
who else do l have then?
This Ramachhan now promises Nandinikutty
Next time along with Ramachhan,
there will be another person.
Who?
Nandinikutty's father!
l will put your tender hands onto his big hands
and say..
''Better take her away,
l'm tired of bearing this burden''
Shoo..Shoo..Shoo!
lt's not pack of lies!! lt's my word!
-l bought a gift and kept it in my box!
- For whom?
For you only!
For me??!
Don't l need to gift you in return
for bringing my father one day?
So l bought it and kept.
l'm sure it will not happen.
Even otherwise, why does Nandini need a
father now?
Just assume my father has come..
What can he do bigger than you?
This Ramachhan will cajole and cheat me!
Big liar!
You promised to teach a song
to sing in School and absconded last time!
Only now you have sprung up.
Only 4 more days left for the Annual day.
That is also gone!
Who said it's gone?This Ramachhan
will go only after teaching my firefly a song.
l came here with a song in my pocket!
Again lies?! Song and Pocket!!
-You like to listen? - Hmm!
Really? Ok!
Then, sit here. Let me listen.
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''
''Will your father come near you?''
Team DrC
''Will your father come near you?''
''To caress your crown
and make you sleep singing stories''
''Will your father come near you?''
''First he applied the kohl of a new dream in
your eyes,''
''Gave tinkling bangles for your wings,''
''He smeared gold and honey
on your little lips and fed you,''
''And came with hands forward when you
toddled''
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''
''Will your father come near you?''
''Will your father come near you?''
Oh God, please move...please move.
''When your ears were pierced to wear diamond
earrings,''
''Didn't he sing songs keeping you
on his shoulders to stop your sobbing?''
''With the ring given by a star''
''Won't you tell me the letter
which he wrote on your little tongue, O firefly''
''Like my shadow, the whole day and night,''
''When my legs faltered
didn't my father come to my aid?''
''lsn't he a stream of love, which never runs
dry''
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''
''Will your father come near you?''
''Didn't he dress you up in a new frock''
''And keep bindi on your forehead?''
''Didn't he come with you till the steps of the
school?''
''When you laugh,
isn't it august moonlight in yourfather's eyes?''
''When you are sad,
won't his heart throb without anyone seeing?''
''Though the girl grows up, isn't she
always a lotus grasshopper in his heart?''
''lsn't she a whimpering cute baby playing
mischief?''
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''
''Will your father come near you?''
''First he applied the kohl of a new dream in
your eyes,''
''Gave tinkling bangles for your wings,''
''He smeared gold and honey
on your little lips and fed you,''
''And came with hands forward when you
toddled''
Very good!
Follow this
All board members will be present for the
programme.
Yourjob will become permanent, l've no doubt.
lt's really divine to impart our knowledge to
others.
When God gives some deformity,
He will also give some talents as a remedy.
l've seen that in every children here.
As far as the blind people are concerned,
they think the entire world is like them!
ls your class fortoday over, Ramaettan?
Hmm! No duty today?
l'm transferred to Law and Order! Mustjoin
tomorrow.
l got into the kitchen early morning ,
and saw a few recipes of my mother
which my grandpa loves.
With all that l made a special lunch for him.
You must be really lucky
to get such a grand daughter.
Lucky?! l will give her 6 months time.
Asked her to say if she has got
someone in her mind.
Or will get her married to whom l like!
Have you started, grandpa? l'm going.
Will come in the evening.
-Are you back home? - Yes.
Drop Jayaraman at home!
-Okay, sir! - Please come, Ramaetta!
Today, l will kill her also! Who will dare to ask
me?
Take off your hands from me!
Take off your hands l say.
-Calm down, Abdu! -Abdu is your father!
-lf l give you a blow.. - Not Abdu, he is Madhu!
Let it be anything! Ask him not to create a
chaos!
-Decent people live here. - My foot!
She lodged a complaint against me to S.P
What will he do?
What is the commotion here?
-This Rascal has come here also.
- Rascal is your paramour!
Don't dare touch her. Get away.
So, you are my wife's paramour now.
She is your Ex-wife now, isn't it?
Didn't you elope with someone?
Now how do you claim rights on her?
Who the hell are you to ask me?
You only said l'm your wife's paramour! Then
what?
-Hey you! - Don't make a scene, Mohideen!
Mohideen is your..!!
-Come here, man. - What the hell is his name?
Dulquer Salman!
-Just leave me! - Madhu, don't make noise.
Settle it amongst yourself if there is any issue!
Why making it public?
Leave me!
Now l'm going!
Don't try to frighten me with Police and Army!
Your scoundrel brother and this blind man..
will surely fall into my clutches one day!
l'll take him to task then.
Hey! Remember!
Give way, Rascal!
Sir!
What is the need to withdraw such a huge
amount now?
l put this money on Nandini's name in Fixed
deposit.
Let's not keep it here anymore.
Deposit this on her Ooty's account.
Why don't we transfer it to her account?
No! Some people are stealthily checking
my accounts nowadays!
Nobody should know to whose account
the money is transferred to!
l promised herthat l will bring you this time.
You must come.
lt's risky to meet her this time.
He is following me like a shadow...That Vasu.
His aim is to find out Nandini.
What for?
Hereafter l'm not going
to conceal anything from you.
Team DrC
You couldn't believe my words, isn't it?
Those who were connected with Vasu's
punishment,
have died at many different places.
Perhaps, could be the vengeance
for devastating his family!
lnvestigated Officer, Post mortem Doctor,
Public Prosecutor Nambiar,
Suppose Vasu is behind all these murders..
Then, his next prey will be ME and NANDlNl!
Groom's people came home fixing the
marriage date of Lakhsmi.
They insist on performing the marriage on 24th!
So soon?
Seems groom has no leave!
What happened to Baputty's matter?.
l couldn't reach him over phone!
No, he purposely averted your call!
No chance! He is not of that sort.
Why don't you still understand people around
you?
Didn't Bapukutty come home 3 months ago
and returned without seeing you.
ln case he has any intention
of returning your money,
wouldn't he have met you?
l don't think you will get back that money
l will surely get back!
You make the arrangements for marriage.
l will. But make sure you arrange
the money forthe expenses.
Take this.
-What is this?
- Sardarji gave this for his daughter's marriage.
Gave dresses for all in attractive colours!
Please move, Ramaettan.
Hey, what happened?
Ameena's child suddenly suffers from
breathing difficulty!
Hold that.
Get inside quickly.
Hold the child. Move immediately.
Child was playing. All of a sudden it fainted.
Occasionally it happens.
lsn't the child's father at here?
He comes now and then. Seems he has
got some business in his hometown
He works in Dubai!
Sir, thank you for protecting my daughter's
honour.
We host a function this evening.
Please attend and bless my daughter.
Definitely!
Thank you!
Full of sweets! You take it.
Sardarji has given handfuls for all the maids
here.
-l also got a Ghagra choli - Really?
Call me once the entertainment gets over this
evening
Surely! Keep this safe.
You look very handsome.
lf there is a turban also,
nobody will say that you are not a Sardarji.
You saw my dress?
How can l see?
Please touch and see.
Thinking l'm a Punjabi,
a Punjabi boy tried to flirt with me.
When l spoke in Malayalam, he ran away.
Thank heavens! That boy escaped!
Shall l ask you something?
You should tell the truth.
-So.. - So?
You like, don't you?
Yeah, very much!
l knew it earlier.
But l need a spicy stew
with lots of green chillies.
Only then it will be delicious to taste!
lt needs to be fermented with toddy and not
yeast!
l asked whether you like me or not
and not about rice cakes.
Why such a hesitation only to say that?
Enough of Cajoling!
Go and get some curry, you lass!
Hell with his Curry!!
lf don't like me, then why did you support me
when that rascal yelled at me?
Or else he would have kicked you to death!
That's the reason people hesitate to help
nowadays.
-Shall l take a selfie? - Eh!
l don't need any KULFl!
lf l need, l shall take it.
Go and stand beside the girls!
Don't make others gossip!
Are you here? We were searching you all over.
Only if you search here, you can find me!
-How will l.. - Please take one photo!
Can't dress up more gorgeous than this ever!
Hey, take off your hands and stand quietly.
Hello...turn straight..
-Stay quietly. - Don't come in between
while taking photograph!
Look here.
Stand without shaking.
Ready! Ok!
Let me see - See!
Splendid!
She really looks very pretty!
Nobody will call her a maid.
Can't you marry her?
She will get a pair and you will get a company.
You've also become bad
with the company of Kunjakka.
Enjoy the feast and go home quickly.
You will not be destined to get such
a food all the day.
Apart from Dosas,
isn't there any ghee rice or chicken biryani?
Chicken Biryani in Sardarji's marriage?
Won't there be chickens in Punjab?
Lets check that with Singh, come.
-Which Singh? -Amal Singh!
Leave me...Mohammed Singh!

Moorthy sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Moorthy sir!
Sir!
Kunjakka, Switch on the generator.
Not sure whether there is diesel! Let me check.
Where?
ln office!
Sir! Judge sir.
He is dead.
Sir!
Minister has come.
Call me later.
Ramettan! Police is standing outside.
You are asked to come overthere
Team DrC
What happened to the matter?
lnquest is getting ready, sir.
Flat Security witnessed the murder first.
-Sir, he is here! - Call him here.
Go there.
Come here.
Stand here.
-Your name? - Kunj...Kunju Mohammed!
Are you the security here?
Answer only to my questions.
Who witnessed the dead body first?
Me only.
-You saw only after someone
took you there, right?
So, it was him who saw it first, right?
No! lt is me only who saw it first.
Forget it.
Who took you there?
Jayaraman!
-So it was Jayaraman
who showed you the dead person- Yes!
So, it was he who saw it first.
No! The first one to see it is me only.
What nonsense you are talking?
Where were you at the time of incident?
l was downstairs.
-Are you married?
- Yes, around 3 - 4 marriages.
-ls everbody fine at home? - Very fine!
Only l'm in bad shape!
l work as a Security here.
So, Jayaraman who saw the incident,
came down the stairs,
-took you there and showed
the dead body, right? - Yes!
So, the one who saw first was him, right?
No! lt's me only!
How can you see it when you were present
at the marriage place?
-Yes!
- Then, how did you know the person was dead?
When Jayaraman cried loud!
-So it was Jayaraman who
took you upstairs. - Yes.
-He only told you about such an incident, right?
- Yes
-He only showed you the dead person, right?
- Hmm!
Then, who saw the body first?
lt's me who saw it first!
What a heck is this!
Where did you get such a crap from?
Shall l give him a blow?
We got to be careful with him.
He is trying to confuse us.
l guess he has a big hand in this!
Later, what happened?
Then what? Person died!
l didn't mean that! After you saw it..
l came running down
and asked Beeran and Rahman to inform Police.
-Beeran and Rahman! - Yes
-Did they inform us? - Yes!
- Where are they? - They are around.
Overthere!
-Them? - Hmm!
Hey, you! Come here!
Who is Beeran?
-Can't you hear? Who is Beeran?
- l don't know sir.
-You, Rahman? - No, sir.
-Well , what is your name? - Raghavan!
-Raghavan?! And your name? - Veeran!
Veeran and Raghavan!!
-Were you the ones who called the Police?
- Yes, sir.
But this fool said it was Beeran and Rahman!
Where the hell they are?
There are no such persons with those names.
Whatever he says is a blatant lie, sir!
Put this liar in the Jeep.
l shall make him spill the beans.
Who is this Jayaraman?
Person standing overthere.
Hey, come here.
-Were you the one who took this fool
upstairs and showed the body first? - Yes, sir.
Then, why is he saying
that he saw the body first?
He is telling the truth only, sir.
-What truth? - Kunjakka only saw it first.
-You also.. - Please listen to what l say.
Answer only to my questions. Got it?
-You only said that you took him upstairs to the
spot where the incident took place - Yes sir.
-Then, it's you who saw it first!
- No, sir. lt's Kunjakka.
Only after you took him to the spot,
this swine saw the body.
That means you saw it first.
No, sir! lt's Kunjakka only.
Are you kidding me, you swine!
How the hell he saw it when you didn't?
Sir, l'm ANDAN(blind)!
Just now you said you are Jayaraman,
and now NANDAN?
All are cheats! Put everybody in the jeep.
Sir...Please..l'm ANDAN(BLlND)
l have no sight...Eye sight!
Really, sir! lt's totally dark! He has no sight!
When you have no sight,
then how did you see the incident first?
That is the reason l told you l saw it first.
Don't talk a word! l will give a blow on your
chest!
Couldn't you tell me
earlierthat he is blind, you Swine?
You only asked me to answer only to your
questions.
Put everyone in the jeep.
Will not disclose the truth if questioned politely.
Many are hanging around
with Cameras to take away our lives!
Now they got some stuff
to munch for a couple of days.
l.G called up.
He too has much pressure from his superior
As the deceased was a retired Chief Justice,
if the case not resolved immediatey
Then Judge will flay us in the Court.
How far is the examination?
Police dog ran up to the road and stopped
there.
Then, what happened?
Passed urine and hung there for some time.
As marriage function was going on,
nobody has any clear picture about the visitors
Post mortem report?
Overdose of lnsulin!
Was the Judge, a diabetic?
Yes sir. He used to take insulin.
But this was administered with force!
Besides, index finger
of the deceased's right hand was cut.
Cloth was stuffed in his mouth.
Was there any theft?
Almirah was lying open.
Watch and ring were all inside.
Not sure if anything else was lost!
You checked his phone?
Yes sir! His last call
was to lift operatorJayaraman!
that too, 10 minutes before the incident!
ls the person here?
Yes sir! We detained almost
all the people from that flat.
Call him inside.
Get up. Come!
Straight!
Turn left!
Next day, keeping the Judge's body
...the killer was there.
That means killer also must be living there.
Rather bringing in a sniffer dog or Swine
Make Jayaraman sniff each and everybody in
the flat
ln case the killer is there,
he will sniff and surely find out.
Are you making fun of us?
l'm not joking.
He is right.
Definitely he will find out the
killer if he goes past him.
Without even asking, he got the sense to
judge whoever uses the lift daily.
Then?
By the time l reached down following the killer
l heard an Autorickshaw moving.
Then l didn't know how he disappeared!
l guess he escaped in that!
-Trace that auto rickshaw - Ok sir.
No one else should know about this.
With a heavy heart, l'm doing this,
only because of your insistence.
Please think over.
Then, later you shouldn't regret.
Just consider you are doing a favourto me.
Let the cash be with you.
When there is a need, l will let you know.
What about Nandini then?
School authorities will call only this number.
Don't disclose anything to them.
See you!
Team DrC
Hello Kanna!
Make arrangements for the marriage..
..in a grand way.
Cash is ready.
You don't have to bother about the source of
funds.
Come on Saturday and collect the cash
from Pillaichettan's shop.
Move away.
Ramettan! lt's me, Ganga!
Someone...someone pushed me!
Nandini Krishnamoorthy! This child studied
here only.
But took T.C and left the school last year.
Do you know which School she joined?
We got few suspicions about his death.
lt's a part of the police enquiry.
l know. l read in papers.
But l don't know which School she joined.
TC and Conduct Certificate was signed
and collected by one Mr.Jayaraman.
You may contact him for more details
He is the Child's local guardian.
-You saw somebody pushing him? - No.
Then, how do you that somebody pushed him?
Jayaraman told me.
Can't trust any of his words!
He only talks irrelevant!
A murderthat a person with eyes didn't see
How will a blind alone see?
Have you ever come across such a story?
l doubt it's one of his trick!
if you turn a blind eye to it,
l will surely make him spill the beans!
Just shut up. Unless there is any valid proof,
we have no right to torture anybody.
..That too a blind man!
That's enough to ask for trouble!
Then media and human rights commission
will...
peel out
-You saw this? - What's it, sir?.
Krishnamoorthy had withdrawn
this amount from the bank -
- in the morning on the day of his murder
Rs.50 lakhs!
Where did that cash disappear?
Here is the bank statement.
Only when l went to transfer uncle's account
to mother's name , we learnt it.
Sir, found that autorickshaw driver.
Call him.
Come inside.
Oh, were you the one?
Don't you know him..
..Chain Babu..
All that glitters on women's neck will be in his
grip!
He is the Culprit.
Will make him disclose about Rs.50 lakhs
if you give him a good treatment!
Do you know only this method?
That was past sir. Now l'm a father of 2 girls.
l make a decent living now.
Still, will a monkey forget to jump?
Why did you go to the flat that night?
-From Hospital, with mother and child...
- Mother also??
What are you saying?
Came to drop mother and child from hospital.
-Whose mother? - Child's mother.
-Whose child? - Mother's child.
Doesn't the child have a name?
You!!
Then?
When l was going back, one person got into the
auto.
Who was that person?
One person!
Doesn't he have a name?
Can l ask names of all those,
who ride in my auto?
What is wrong with asking? Leave it!
How was he?
Like everybody does, he also sat behind.
No point of questioning him like this.
l will take him to a side
and do a detailed investigation. Come!
You!!
Will you be able to
identify him if you see him again?
Yes sir! His forehead was injured and
blood was seeping out.
Where did you drop him?
He got down at the Lisie Junction!
-Didn't he pay you the fare? - He did!
How much?
That's..one Rs.50 and two Rs.20
Give me those notes.
-l gave at home to buy fish. - Shucks!
lf it was there,we could've found the Culprit
now.
How?
With help of the fingerprints..
You!!!
Sir, shall l take leave? Thank you, sir.
-Shall l also.. - Ok!
-ln which shop did you buy fish? - Hey you!
Don't utter a word now on! l will question him.
You enquired about that person in hospital.
Yes, sir! No such person walked in there.
Take his statement, his description,
and send him.
-Get his mobile number also. - Okay.
-Come! - Hey.
You have to come whenever we call
Sir!
Moorthy sir's killer is here! Close the gate.
Don't let anybody out.
Please inform the Police
He is inside one of the flats in the 11th floor.
ls there anybody else inside otherthan you?
No.
Only me and my daughter.
What happened?
Ask men inside your flat to come out.
-Hubby...-What happened?
We are looking out for a person.
That's our American Vijayan's flat. He has
locked it and gone. Nobody is inside this.
Kunjaka, you only said,
that you saw light during nights here.
-He is mad.-Mad is your mom.
l really saw, Jayaraman.
Nobody is in that flat!
l cleaned the flat and locked it only 2 days back.
Where are the keys, Kunjaka?
-At office! -Bring it soon
How can a killer enter into a flat
which is locked from outside?
Kunjakka, get the keys
Don't close the lift! l'm also coming
Whom are you looking for?
Nobody came here.
Looks like it's locked from inside.
Move aside.
Move aside.
Don't hit him. He is my younger brother!
Move aside
This was the cash Krishnamoorthy
had withdrawn from the bank.
Bank's stamp is there on its wrapper.
How did the cash come to his hands?
On the day he died, Moorthy Sir, on hearing my
woes, gave this money to me in the morning.
What for?
When Police enquired him at his
work place in Bangalore,
He lost thatjob.
Fearing that he may be killed if he's caught
by the Police, l made him stay here secretly.
On the night when Moorthy sir died,
l gave him the cash and asked him to go
somewhere and escape.
Later, when this place was under police
observation he couldn't get away from here.
l swear on God, he hasn't killed anyone.
Did you know that he kept
so much of cash with him?
Yes, l knew sir.
How?
l saw Ramettan giving him the cash
and Moorthy Sir keeping it inside.
Then, where did he keep the cash?
On the shelf.
Team DrC
Hey, move.
Sir!
Do you suspect him?
Sir..Not him, sir.
How do you say this so strongly?
The kind of situation here makes me tell this...
There is some secret affair
between Jayaraman and Devayani
-Everyone in the flat knows that.
-Yeah, you are right.
That is the truth.
He is only the Killer!
Three of them planned and killed.
And to save his skin, he is fabricating a killer.
There is no such person!!
Not a fabricated person, Sir!
lf you've finished your coffee,
please listen to me carefully.
He has a good physique,
wearing pant and shirt.
Slim and more than 6 feet tall.
Did you measure him with a tape?
No sir!
Comparing my height,
l can judge the height of the person
who is against me or talking before me.
You are approximately 6 feet tall, am l right, sir?
Finished talking
He is approximately 70 - 72 kgs.
Comparing my weight,
l can guess the weight, if l lift up something
or anything that falls on me,
Not only that, he is a left-hander.
How do you know that?
He wore his watch on the right hand.
Normally only left-handers will do that.
Here he is
Sir it's pretty clear that he is
trying to hide truth.
ln his earlier statement he told the
killer fled away in an auto.
The statement of the auto driver and that of
Jayaraman is absolutely inconsistent.
lt seems somebody is attempting
to kill the judge
And he was in search of him! Says some
nonsense!
lf we trust his words, then we'll be nowhere
Jayarama, you went with him to withdraw
money from the bank, right?
Yes sir.
How much?
Rs 50 lakhs!
When there was a scuffle
between you and the killer,
Did he carry any bag or box?
No, sir.
Killer can't get away with such a huge amount
in his pocket, can he?
Then, who took away that cash?
Sir, that is..
He's struggling for words...he is lying sir
l don't know sir
Why did he take such a big amount from the
bank?
Sir, that is..
Come on roll...Roll down from here.
He said that it was to give to his daughter.
Where is his daughter now?
Now, have you become deaf also?
Where is his daughter?
Sir, l would like to know who
all are here in this room.
Your mother and your mother's husband!!
Answer to the question.
Sir, l don't know. l've only heard
that he has got a daughter.
Didn't you sign and collect the TC from -
- Marthoma School,
2 yrs ago as her local guardian?
He knows the truth, sir.
Who told you this, sir?.
Do you think we are fools!
-Sir, l understood one thing.-You come
Team DrC
Hey, come here.
Send everybody out.
Was it him who got into your auto that day?
No sir.
ls it him?
No sir. l know Ramettan well.
That can be anyone
Can be any one who attended that marriage
function!
May be!
Then, did the killer he said vanish into thin air?
l have a great idea. You go, l will handle it.
All of you can leave now.
Must come when l call!
Get going.
Jayaraman wait. l got something to tell you.
Send her.
Put him inside.
You dog!
What's happening here, Kanna?
lt seems brother stole someone's cash in the
flat.
Oh my God! Wedding is going to be held here.
Sir, he is not opening his mouth.
Tell me, dog!
l'll bury you here itself. Do you understand?
Bring it
That's mine! Brother didn't hide anything here.
How did this much gold come here?
lt came from Muvattupuzha by bus.
This family's plight isn't that
bad to survive with theft money!
Your family status will be known to public
shortly.
Get up, you swine
Move.
Grandpa! Court freed Ramettan
Judge said he can't be kept in remand.
Nabbing anybody if they couldn't nab the real
culprit!
That C.l got punishment for harassing
this poor man unnecessarily!
He has to stand before the Court Verandah
till 5 p.m without moving anywhere.
So he will not trouble you hereafter.
Jayaraman, your uncle is waiting outside.
He wants to see you.
Best......
Why did you come here?
Only 2 more days left for marriage.
Plenty of work to do.
Lakshmi wanted to see you.
Won't l come there?
Don't feel offended if l say this!
Villagers are talking ill of you.
Groom's father had called up.
l guess they also learnt about it.
So they want to perform the marriage at
Thalasery.
But we fixed it to be performed in ourtemple,
right?
lt seems if marriage is held here,
their relatives will come to know this
and it will bring shame to their family.
That's why they took such a decision.
Marriage is our first priority! So l also agreed.
-Lakshmi...-She is here.
Come here, dear.
-Why did you bring her here?
-l only insisted to meet you
l'm innocent, dear.
lt may be true, but can we
shut the villagers mouth?
Brother, do you wish to stop this marriage?
Avoiding me...?!
Please bless me!
They left!
They didn't tell what the matter was!
Said they're calling from Nandini's school!
They asked you to give them a call.
Was it Alphonsa teacher who called up?
No, it was a man's voice.
No chance of anyone calling up
You better call and see.
Only school authorities know this number,
right?
Who all are in this shop now?
Only Elsamma who is working in Post office!
You make a call.
That's..there is no range in
that teacher's mobile.
Seems she doesn't know who called from
school.
lf you receive a call again, ask the name of the
caller.
Talk loudly! Hello..Hello.
Give me a Pears and Gillette!
Shucks! What a mess!
Bro, shall l make a call.
That money lender has come with lock and key
Now bride has to go from shop's verandah to
marriage canopy
Unable to bear the shame we have to
coverthe faces in public
You still have enough stolen money with you,
right?
Repay the debt and get back the deed!.
l know where it is now!
Wasn't that money you entrusted Pillaichettan
to handover to me for marriage expenses?
Had l opened my mouth that day,
you would've been behind bars.
l thought not to hinder her marriage, l kept
mum.
l asked that money lenderto sell the house
and handover if any amount is left.
And if you come asking for any share from that
l won't even consider you as brother.
Was he telling the truth?
No, Kunjakka.
Then, how did you get money for the marriage?
l sold my shop to Pillaichettan. lt's that cash.
Wasn't that your only earning?
Still Bapukutty cheated you!

But not so easy to track like local numbers.
Ganga, Keep an eye whether anybody
is following or watching me closely.
You get down, Rametta. l will do.
Are there many customers in the shop?
Only a few
Let me know when they leave.
l need to make a call..
An urgent call!
Jayaraman, You can call now.
Here is the Coin.
No, l will call you
Bro, l forgot my phone somewhere here.
lt was in my hand while coming here.
Got it!
St.Paul Church is close to it, isn't it?
You wait in front of the Church!
l will come there immediately.
Any auto waiting in front of the Church?
Then, drop me beside it.
Rametta! l am here.
Are you sure it is him?
l couldn't reach Ganga madam over phone.
That's why l called you.
You told me to inform if l saw him again
And l'm also not sure if he
is the same person you are looking for.
But l'm sure it's him who got into
auto that night from the flat.
Which place is this?
lt's an old school run by the Church.
Now it's being renovated in a big way.
Babu, do one thing. l'll wait here.
You go inside. And if you see him,
bring him outside
From his voice, l can make out
if he is the one l'm looking for!
lf he is the one, then he must never escape!
Go!
Babu, be careful!
l've brought the person. He is waiting outside.
You guys deal! Give my share and send me.
l will settle it now.
Before that, you will have to do one more job.
Dial 100 and inform Police that l'm here now.
WHAT?
Just do whatever l tell you.
lnform Police that Judge's killer is here.
After coming out from Jail, l'm leading a
decent life without doing any crimes.
Although l'm a father of 2 girls and live in
poverty,
l live peacefully now.
Only because l needed money urgently,
l agreed to this!
Please don't put me in a trap.
Do this also and take your share
and quit the place.
l'm Autodriver Babu from Pallimukku!
Judge's killer is at St.Paul school Fort Kochi
Here is your share.
Sir...Sir..that Killer saw me
Sir, please come quickly
He is attempting to kill me.
Sir...please sir.
Hey!
Sir, Autodriver is dead.
l couldn't record his statement.
And Jayaraman? What did he say?
Admitted the Crime?
He is fooling us again.
He says, Autodriver called him
And he went there...
On the way he tried to contact Police
And it was unreachable.
Now, we got plenty of evidence against him.
We have not disclosed about the incident!
Until we get a clear picture..
Yes, that is why l say, he must admit the crime.
He is behind everything!
Sir, you don't worry.
We will only get into trouble.
Now, we have lots of evidences against him
Let that mortuary Madhu also come.
l will make him admit the truth.
Think and do! Otherwise, you will be screwed!
This time judge will make you
to stand on the roof top
He will not admit the truth
if we give him a feast
He is born in fire
l will produce you the evidences for all.
-Madhu!-Where is he?
He is in the Kitchen.
Commissioner wants him to admit the truth by
dawn.
Only then we can disclose about his arrest.Got
it?
Come!
Oh him!!
Do you already know him?
Yes!
Haven't you heard this Sir, One that you
searched will be found at your feet.
l've been waiting for long to get him in my
hands
Sir, you get going!
l can also make him admit that
he killed his father and mother.
Madhu?!
No! Your Yama!
Last time you escaped.
This time, no chance!
Lift up this rascal.
His neck was slit.
We have the booty as sword-stick, knife etc
Why did you bring her here?
No Sir....it's for a proof
At midnight?
Take her to the 2nd room. l will come there.
Team DrC
You only have him as your own.
lf he hangs himself to death tomorrow,
Who else do you have then?
He will not take such a drastic step.
We are innocents!
She is not able to understand anything.
Make her understand. Or let her suffer.
See this...
When your brother was freed from the custody
today,
We got it in writing from him
that he has been freed without charge.
There are witnesses too!
lf he dies anywhere, Police
will not hold any responsibility.
Even if we hang him to death on a tree,
lt will only be considered as a Suicide.
So, please take a decision quickly.
Who is important
- your brother or that blind man?
You have no other option than signing it.
Make him run one or two rounds.
Or bruises will turn into blue when a blood clot!
Are you resting?
Run!
Run there..
l will come home late. You sleep.
Will reach home only at dawn.
Would l get anything to eat?
At this hour?
ls pizza enough?
Any rubbish! Go and get it.
Take it.
Nobody knows about your arrest.
Tomorrow papers will flash
that you fled away killing the driver.
Until you admit , you will be here.
As you are blind, even if you fall into the well
Or hit by the train and die also, no one will care.
So better give a written statement.
What do you say?
Open your mouth, you dog!
Give him some water!
Ask him if he wants food.
Leave him for sometime! Let him take a gasp!
Hello! l'm on duty now. Which Cinema?
Oh my God!
These people will surely kill me, sister!
Jayaraman, forget about Krishnamoorthy sir's
murder!
let's think that you have not killed him.
But in driver's murder case, you
will definitely be punished.
l got plenty of evidences against you.
Whether you killed one, two or even three
there will not be a big difference in the
punishment!
By troubling us like this,
is there any gain for you? No!
Therefore, admit to all these crimes.
Why unnecessarily get beaten up?!
l didn't kill anyone.
Didn't l say he will not admit?
So l will get it done right away.
This is artist Pappu's dialogue
You are not the only witness.
We got an eye witness,
who saw you killing Krishnamoorthy!
lt's a blatant lie. There is no such witness.
-lf so, bring them! - Go and get her.
What is all this?
No sir! He is really a fraud!
Sir, this case is closed. Please read this.
Sit down.
Whatever you've written
in this statement is true?
Yes
Jayarman killed Krishnamoorthy for money,
right?
Say it aloud! Let everybody hear
Yes!
-And you witnessed it? - Yes!
And to conceal it,
he offered you money, didn't he?
-Yes or No? - Yes!
Deva...
lt's not true.
As if you are the only truth-teller,
and the rest are liars!
lsn't she your lover?.
You should've realized when
you gave sweet promises and dumped her?
No family matters
Sign this.
Team DrC
Sir, please give me one more chance.
May be l can find out the real killer.
Sit down l say.
Trying to fool us?!
Stop bullshiting!
You are creating a fake killer in your
imagination,
To mislead the police investigation
Only that auto driver was against your
fabricated tales.
So you finished him too
No sir. Please trust me!
l got many reasons for not trusting you!
You only said that the Killer
is very strong and intelligent!
Then why did the killer spare a blind and feeble
person like you on many occasions?
He is really an intelligent person!
So, he very well knows that it is not that easy!
Why?
He can't overpower me
Not only him, it's not possible for
anyone who challenges me directly.
Are you a superman?
See, this blind man's haughtiness!
Sir, you please go home. We'll handle this.
We'll bring him to the Commissioner office in
the morning.
He will admit the crimes. Go home, hopefully.
First drop her home.
Sir, please give me a last and final chance.
Sir, l know where the killer is now.
Stop otherwise l will kill you.
Don't hit me anymore..please.
Hey, lock the door.
Don't!
No matter however much you raise your voice,
it won't be heard outside.
That's why we made the set-up like this.
lt was not for that reason
l stopped you from locking.
Then?
lt will be impossible even if you wish to escape!
Hit him.
Thrash him to pulp.
Keep yourfeet in the warm water
for some more time.
lf you sleep for some time,
your tiredness and pain will go!
Pizza shop will open only at 10.30 a.m
Pizza shop?! What for?
Ramettan says, Killer had eaten
pizza just before the murder.
His hands had that smell, it seems!
But all the people in the flats had food
only from Sardarji's marriage function.
ln case the killer lives in that flat,
And if we can find out in which flat
pizza had been delivered.
Then we may get a hint about the
flat he resides.
However, it is good that you came here,
Jayaraman.
When l enquired on the basis of the details you
gave,
l understood it has some link with a case
l investigated in Crime branch.
lt's a coincidence!
All those who died were somehow
related to this rape case!
l got Vasu's photo from the jail.
lt may help us.
Team DrC
Pizza was delivered
to only one flat on that day.
That too at 6 p.m to Door no.1106.
Do you know who lives there?
Amina!!
Here is your stick.
Police came here looking for you.
Kunjakka, have you seen Amina's husband?
This is not my husband!
My husband's friend.
Does he live here?
No! He often comes here.
For the sake of my daughter's treatment,
he arranged this flat for me.
When will he come again?
He will not come.
He came yesterday..
And said he is
going back to work place in Dubai.
Does he have a phone?
Sorry, Mr.Swaminathan! She is a sponsored
child.
Apart from local guardian Jayaraman,
nobody else is permitted to see the child.
l'm sorry.
lt's not necessary to see her!
As she is the daughter of Krishnan uncle,
and as he is no more now,
Being his nephew, don't l
have some responsibilities?
State Bank of lndia, Kochi account no.1009797
From this account only, Krishnan uncle
used to transferthe fees amount!
Because is death and consequent nonpayment
of fees should not affect the child's education.
So l came here.
lf there are any dues in the fees,
l got the money with me.
Can you please check ?
Hmm..one minute.
Connect to the accounts department
Yes, can you please check whether there is
any due in the fees of Nandini Moorthy - Std 7 D
Listen! Everyone can't go
together in the name of Diwali!
lnform Staff that l will cut those 4 days pay.
l can't manage everything alone.
Entire fees for this year has been paid.
Hello bro!
Can you please give this to 7 D Nandini?
lt's Diwali, right? Keep it!
Then, did your dad say anything?
That doesn't matter.
Nandini - Here!
l also checked! His phone is switched off.
No point in trying.
Have this tea. Take it.
All these days,
Vasu was following me like a shadow
For reaching Nandini was possible
only through me.
Now, how did he come to know
the whereabouts of Nandini?
Therefore, he will not need my help anymore.
He is a psychopath!
He will not give a damn to your request!
l know. But l need to disclose a truth to him.
With that all his
vengeance and bitterness will end.
You will not be able to convince
a person with vengeance!
He will neither understand
nor be prepared to listen.
He will do. He must!
Do you know, Ganga,
the one whom he is trying to kill
is none than his own daughter!!
That child survived!
Vasudevan, who spent 4 yrs in a
mental asylum wasn't aware of it.
When he comes out afterthe sentence,
Moorthy Sir wanted to handover him his
daughter,
Only with that intention and atone for his guilt
Moorthy Sir brought her up!
Nandini! Someone has come to see you
with Diwali sweets.
l knew you would come!
-How?- l saw you in my dream last night.
That's great. Who told you that l have come?
Sistertold me someone has come
to see me with sweets.
Who else will come in search of me other than
you?
What? Sweets?
ls anyone around whom you aren't familiar
with?
Check!
Hello! l'm Ganga.
That man has reached here. He was here now.
Why don't we inform the police?
No use! lt's the truth only we both know.
Even if we disclose it,
nobody can arrest or punish him,.
However, it is not safe to let Nandini stay here.
O God! l forgot to get sugar.
Spoon...Thanks!
Come!
Team DrC
l informed everything to Sister!
Ganga showed me his photo.
He's the same man who came to school.
Don't worry. You can stay here.
Only l'm here now.
Rest of the teachers
have gone home for holidays.
There are 4 rooms upstairs. And also down.
You can stay wherever you like!
He was, along with us,
till we reached here!
Keep the coffee there and you go and sleep,
Sister!
l will take when l need it.
Don't forget to lock the door from inside.
Never open the door
if it's someone otherthan me.
Someone is standing beside the window!
Please listen to me, Vasu!
Nandini whom you are trying to kill
is none other than your own daughter!
l'm the Destroyer and you are the Protector!
When you realized that your efforts
will not work to rescue her ,
Are you trying to put me down emotionally?
l'm telling the truth. She is really your daughter.
Trust me, Vasu! She is your daughter.
l saw with my own eyes.
My child's body also along with the
frozen bodies of my otherfamily members!
No!! No attempts of yours can make me Back-
off!
Ramachha...on the right hand side.
Nandini...come.
Come here.
lt's locked.
lt's also locked.
Ramachha, come!
Gosh! lt's him!
Team DrC
Ramachha! Come.
All the doors are locked. Come!
Steps! Be careful!
That man is not yourfather!
Like the way l tell lies and cheat you,
l also told a lie and cheated him.
That man is coming
...with a mobile flashlight in his hand.
Where did you get this from?
Lying on the ground.
As it should not reach his hands,
l took and kept it.
Ramettan, Since a long time,
a man is waiting to see you!
Who?
l don't know him. l've not seen him before.
Jayarama, it's me.
-Baputty? - Hmm!
l don't know what excuse
to give and ask yourforgiveness.
l wasn't able to arrange the cash
on time as expected.
For the favour you did to me,
l'd given you only hardships in return!
Like pleading God, l plead you..
Please don't curse me.
Hey no! All of us are human beings, Baputty?
All of us face such situations!
l had confidence that you will not betray me.
Like the way we believe there is God,
l believed that
you will also come one day.
Here.. your property deed.
l settled all the dues to Varghese.
Can you do me a favour?
Sure, tell me.
Handover this to Kannan. lt is entitled to them.
Why will l, who has no kith and kin,
need these properties?
Don't ask where l'm going.
When there is a need, just give me a call
l will be there.
Sister...
Sister...this is... for the child.
Sending me away?
That is how the things are, dear!
Whoever we think, as own,
will leave us one day.
Again, we are destined to live
Sometimes, without also knowing
for whom and what purpose!
No factors should undermine us!
-Shall l say that in English? - Hmm!
That is LlFE!
My child should study well and come up in life!
From some corner of the World,
this Ramachhan will keep praying for you daily.
Get going.
Shall l ask you something, Ramachha?
Didn't you say...
lf we feel there is someone of our own,
Life will be full of thrill!
Just a while ago you said,
that you have nobody of your own.
Am l also not like you?
So, you, be my company
And l, be yours!
Won't the life be full of thrill?
Hey, you naughty girl!
Then, why don't we become like that?
Then, take my gift!
What is that?
