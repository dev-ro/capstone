THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER
based on stories by Edgar A. Poe
sick... worried...
my wife Madeline...
"I need someone to drive me to Usher
tonight. "
In the nearly decaying manor-house,
Slr Roderick kept his wife Madeline
in a strange seclusion,
dominating her
through his tyrannical disposition.
"No. I would not make
my horse take a step further
for all your Lordship's gold."
The oppressive melancholy of USHER'S
surroundings seemed supernatural.
"The doctor."
The illness of Lady Madeline,
Roderick Usher's wife,
baffled the skill of her physician.
As a result of a curious hereditary flaw,
every Usher devoted himself
to painting the portrait of his wife.
"It is there that she is alive."
"My dear Roderick,
you are burning with fever."
"Her Grace is feeling tired and begs you
to excuse her from the table. "
"It is there that she is alive."
Roderick was seized again
by his strange impulse to paint.
His only thought was to be alone
with Madeline, his sole model.
How could he get rid of his visiting
and now unwelcome friend?
Twisted as by a tempest, the Usher's
ancestral past weighed upon Roderick,
who was the last survivor of the race,
with all the weight of his heredity.
"My dear and only friend,
I am touched by your concern.
"But you too must take care of yourself.
"A few steps outside will do you good
before you go to bed. "
Roderick's brush was like a magic wand.
Each stroke gave more life to the portrait
while making Madeline more pallid,
as though the young girl gave to the painted
picture the very strength she was losing.
"This is indeed life itself."
Obsessed by all mysteries, Roderick had long
meditated upon the theories of Magnetism.
"I tell you, Doctor. She may not be dead."
"She shall not leave me.
We shall bury her right here."
"I forbid, do you hear,
I forbid anyone to nail the coffin."
After the burial of Madeline,
the hours, the days went by
In frightening dreariness
and oppressive silence.
Tense and nervous, Roderick seemed
to be waiting for a sign.
The slightest noise exasperated him...
Roderick dared not repeat the insane thought
that oppressed him... Madeline...
This was a stormy night,
charged with electricity.
There is a two-fold Silence.
One is bodily silence; be not afraid.
But should some urgent fate
bring thee to meet his shadow,
nameless elf, that haunteth the lone regions
where hath trod no foot of man,
commend thyself to God.
"Now can you hear her?"
"Roderick, you should not see that.
"Let me read you
something to amuse you. "
And Ethelred uplifted his mace outright,
and, with blows,
made a path through the boards
of the door for his gauntleted hand;
and now pulling therewith sturdily,
he so cracked, and ripped...
And Ethelred uplifted his mace,
and struck upon the head of the dragon,
which fell before him,
and gave up his pestilent breath,
with a shriek so horrid and harsh,
and withal so piercing...
And now, the champion approached valorously
over the silver pavement of the castle
to where the shield was upon the wall;
which in sooth tarried not for his full coming,
but fell down at his feet,
with a mighty great and terrible...
"Yes, I can hear. I have heard
for a long time, since the first day... "
"We have put her alive in the tomb."
