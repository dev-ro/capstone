BOY 2: Oh, man!
BOY 3: Tough Iuck!
(SNICKERS )
Irving, here's your big shot.
This is just Iike Game Seven
of the '26 Series. Babe came to the...
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, you're not Babe Ruth, okay?
Now Iook, you've got no strike zone,
so he's guaranteed to waIk you.
-UMPIRE: Batter up!
-Just don't swing.
-He's gonna whiff. Bring it in.
-Easy out, easy out.
-Let him waIk you.
-Don't swing at it, Irving!
Yeah, don't swing!
If I don't swing,
how are you gonna know I can hit?
(LAUGHING)
BOY: Don't swing, Irving!
BOY 3: Hey, batter, batter, batter,
hey, batter, batter, swing!
-UMPIRE: Strike one!
-What did I just teII you?
-BOY: Come on.
-You've got no strike zone!
(HEAVING)
-UMPIRE: Strike two!
-Just take the pitch!
BOY: Don't swing!
BOY 2: Don't swing, Irving!
BOY 4: Don't swing at it, Irving!
ANNOUNCER: Now batting, number one,
Yankee Irving!
(THUDDING)
Ah!
Nice job, whiff.
That's it.
You're never pIaying on my team again.
BOY: Give it up.
BOY 2: Go home.
BOY 3: Yeah, don't come back.
BOY 4: Come on, Iet's get out of here.
BOY: Loser.
WOMAN: Honey! Dinnertime!
(GRUNTS )
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Huh?
Hmm.
(HEAVING)
Hmm.
Guess nobody wants you
in the game either.
(BICYCLE BELL RINGING)
Hey, Irving, you stink!
(BELL RINGING)
(LAUGHING)
ANNOUNCER: The Movietone News.
Bringing you the news
just days after it's happened.
In sporting news, the Yankees continue
their spIendiferous winning streak.
It's Game Three of the WorId Series.
Bottom of the ninth,
the Yankees down by three,
bases Ioaded,
Babe Ruth steps up to the pIate.
WiII the SuItan of Swat save the day?
You betcha!
(CHEERING)
So what's NapoIeon Cross,
owner of the Chicago Cubs,
going to do now?
With his best bat, DarIin', in his hands,
Babe Ruth is unstoppabIe.
CROSS: Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth.
Babe Ruth and his best bat, DarIin'.
He's everywhere!
Every newsreeI, every newspaper
taIks about Babe Ruth.
Look at aII this stuff! Babe Ruth sippy cup,
Babe Ruth siIver doIIars,
Babe Ruth underpants,
obviousIy for the Iarger chiId.
What's he got that I haven't got?
He's got a WorId Series trophy!
And I want one!
-Is that too much to ask?
-No, not at aII.
Why don't you put me back in, Mr. Cross?
I'II heIp you win that trophy.
I'm working on a new pitch. I caII it...
(CHUCKLING) Are you ready?
The booger baII.
(SNORTING)
No, Lefty,
even with your most outrageous cheating
you're no match for Babe Ruth.
Cheating? Me? Babe Ruth's the cheater.
I bet he's got some Iucky
voodoo charm or something.
That's cheating.
(COUGHING)
You're right, Lefty.
Babe Ruth does have a Iucky charm.
What is it, what is it, what is it?
It's his bat.
So what do we do?
I'II teII you what we do.
We take away his bat. Let's do the math.
-Going into the Iight.
-Babe without bat is nothing.
Without that bat, he's just big and fat!
(LAUGHING)
(COUGHING)
Put that on a T-shirt.
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, I Iike it.
It's good stuff, it's good stuff.
OnIy one probIem.
How we gonna get Babe Ruth's Iucky bat?
-Not ''we,'' you.
-But, Mr. Cross, I...
Get me that bat. And I think
the onIy way to get it is to steaI it.
Otherwise, you're out!
-MOM: Hi, honey, how was your day?
-Hey, Mom.
-Is Dad home yet?
-Not yet.
-He's working Iate.
-Again?
-Dinner wiII be ready soon.
-Not hungry.
(SNIFFLING)
BOY: Why do I aIways get stuck
with the Ioser?
BOY2: Yankee Irving again!
(LAUGHING)
MOM: He's working Iate.
BOY: That's it.
You're never pIaying on my team again.
BOY: You're not Babe Ruth, okay?
BOY: Why do we aIways get stuck
with Yankee?
(GASPING)
(GRUNTS )
(KNOCKING)
You think you couId take your thumb
out of my eye?
Whoa !
(SCREAMING)
(GASPING)
Huh?
What?
-Are you taIking?
-I am.
One smart feIIa, he feIt smart.
Two smart feIIas, they feIt smart.
Three smart feIIas, they aII feIt smart.
I'm taIking.
Wait a second. Where are you going?
Back to the sandIot,
where I was peacefuIIy decomposing.
(HEAVING)
Hey, watch it there, grabby hands!
Don't make me go aII
crazy eight baII on you.
(HEAVING)
(GASPING)
(HEAVING)
Whoa !
Where did you go?
Hey, Fuzzy, how do I get out of here?
-This kid is nuts.
-I just wanna taIk.
And I just wanna Ieave.
(GRUNTING)
Hey, genius, it just so happens
you Ieft a gaping hoIe in the infieId.
Sayonara.
Your Iiving room is a IittIe cramped.
And dark.
(EX CLAIMS )
Huh?
(WHOOPING)
I'm roIIin' in styIe!
Whoa !
Nobody gets their mitts on Screwie.
I'm going back to the sandIot.
Ouch!
Why can't I break a window?
Every other baII can break a window.
Gotcha.
-What's going on in here?
-Mom, Iook, a taIking basebaII.
He never gets tired of that one.
Oh, my gosh, a taIking basebaII.
WeII, I think I hear the meatIoaf taIking.
-It's saying, ''Yankee, time for dinner.''
-TaIking meatIoaf?
Food can't taIk. Except for beans.
They can make themseIves heard.
-Go get cIeaned up.
-She can't hear you?
I don't know. Let's see. HeIp!
I've been kidnapped by a deranged chiId!
Yup, you're right. She can't hear.
(SQUEAKING)
PIease don't skimp on the soap.
You smeII Iike a week-oId hot dog.
Oh!
(SPLASHING)
(GURGLING)
Kid, quit it.
That's my protective coating of dirt.
(BUBBLING)
I wish Dad was here.
Oh, sweetheart, you know
he's got to work the extra shifts.
I know, but I reaIIy need to see him.
TeII you what,
why don't you take him his dinner?
-ReaIIy?
-Just this once.
You know you're not supposed
to be there whiIe he's working.
Thanks, Mom.
Great. So just drop me in the sandIot
on the way to see your daddy, and...
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
YANKEE: Making sure
you don't go anywhere.
-Not the underpants drawer!
-Don't worry. They're cIean.
(BALL BOUNCING)
SCREWIE: Not anymore.
(SQUEAKING)
YANKEE: Wow!
(EX CLAIMS )
Now batting for the New York Yankees,
number one, Yankee Irving!
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you. I brought you dinner.
Great. What are we having?
Mom's mystery meatIoaf.
Hmm.
MeatIoaf. Let's start with dessert.
So, what's new?
Dad, you're not gonna beIieve this.
Oh, no? Try me.
I found a taIking basebaII.
Oh, reaIIy? Does he have a name?
(CHUCKLING)
I caII him Screwie.
Oh, yeah? Where'd you find it?
At the sandIot.
Did you pIay baII today?
Yeah, but I don't think
I wanna pIay anymore.
Hey, I thought you Ioved basebaII.
WeII, I think I'm in a sIump.
Hmm.
You know, I was watching the team
practice the other day, and it struck me,
here are guys who make a Iiving
pIaying basebaII.
They pIay every day, and even on the day
after they Iose a game,
they're stiII standing at the pIate
swinging that bat.
And you know
how they got to be so good?
They just keep swinging?
(CHUCKLING)
Come on, I got something to show you.
(CLICKING)
Babe Ruth!
YANKEE: Is that DarIin'?
DAD: (CHUCKLING) Yup. Sure is.
Babe had that bat custom made
three years ago.
That was the first year
he hit 50 home runs.
That's right. PeopIe say she was made
from a thousand-year-oId tree
growing on the side of Mount OIympus.
I'm pretty sure it was made in Kentucky.
Hey, come on, paI, we shouId head home.
Oh, come on, Dad,
just another minute, pIease?
I teII you what, you can stay here
for a few more minutes
whiIe I put my things away.
-Meet you at the back gate. DeaI?
-Yeah.
Yankee, don't touch anything
and make sure you cIose the door
when you Ieave.
I promise.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
(DOOR CLOSING)
-You! What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-I was just heIping my dad mop up.
-Scram !
(PANTING)
What are you Iooking at?
Here you go!
(SNORING)
Kid! Kid! Hey, kid! Wake up!
You're turning me into a spitbaII.
(EX CLAIMING)
(YAWNING)
(BREAKING WIND )
How Iong you been taking
trombone Iessons?
(STRETCHING)
Good morning.
(YAWNING)
I thought you were giving that up.
My dad says you shouId never
give up something you Iove.
-Has he ever seen you bat?
-Hey!
So, you know a Iot about basebaII, right?
I mean, since you are one.
I know one thing about basebaII, it stinks.
And you saw me pIay basebaII, right?
Make that two things.
It stinks and so do you.
WeII, then maybe
you can give me some pointers.
I couId point you to another hobby.
How about marbIes or kite watching?
You can watch peopIe fIy kites.
How can you hate basebaII?
You are a basebaII.
Kid, Iook,
basebaII's onIy gonna break your heart.
Did you know I made it to the majors?
-You were in the majors?
-Oh, yeah.
I remember it Iike it was yesterday.
Sun was shining,
forty thousand fans screaming
as I'm tossed to the mound.
It was Iike a dream come true.
AII I ever wanted was to be home run baII.
And on the very first pitch, crack,
I'm on my way going, going,
fouI.
That's right, kid, fouI baII.
Right out of the park.
Dreams and everything vanished.
And did anyone ever come Iook for me?
No. They Ieft me out there to rot.
So beIieve me when I teII you,
basebaII is a fieId of broken dreams.
Trust me, I know.
(KNOCKING)
(DOOR OPENING)
-DAD: Mr. Robinson.
-Good morning, StanIey. Mrs. Irving.
ROBINSON: I'm sorry to bother you
so earIy,
but we have a reaI probIem here.
DAD: What sort of a probIem, sir?
-ROBINSON: This is Officer Bryant.
-HeIIo.
ROBINSON: Someone broke into
the Yankees' Iocker room.
-MOM: Oh, no.
-Babe Ruth's bat is missing.
BRYANT: You were the onIy one there
with the keys, Mr. Irving.
MOM: What are you impIying?
BRYANT: Did you see anyone eIse
in the Iocker room Iast night?
-Wait. There was a security guard.
-DAD: Yankee...
Dad, after you Ieft the Iocker room
a security guard came in
and toId me to get out.
-You took your son into the Iocker room?
-It was just for a minute.
Do you mind if I Iook in his room?
-Excuse me, my son is not a thief.
-ROBINSON: Irving.
Thank God you're here. This kid is crazy.
First he put me in the underpants drawer,
then he pushed me underwater,
then he forced me to eat meatIoaf.
-ROBINSON: This is a disaster.
-MeatIoaf!
-ROBINSON: The Series is onIy haIf over.
-Are you Iistening?
What am I gonna teII the Babe? We need
to pack aII the gear for Chicago today.
The bat's not here.
Son, if you know what happened
to the bat, you need to come cIean now.
-But that's what I'm trying to teII you.
-StanIey, this is a reaI mess.
I... I know, Mr. Robinson.
As the GeneraI Manager
of the New York Yankees,
I have no other choice. You're fired.
-Fired?
-Mr. Robinson, pIease.
StanIey, someone has to be heId
responsibIe. It was your shift.
If Babe's bat is found, then I'II reconsider,
but, untiI then, I'm sorry.
StanIey, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna be out on the streets.
-I'II get another job. I'II get two jobs.
-There are no jobs.
Yankee, you were aIone in that
Iocker room. Now the bat's missing.
-StanIey...
-EmiIy,
there was no security guard on duty.
Yes, there was. Maybe he took the bat.
That's enough.
Son, what happened to the bat?
I don't know.
-Go to your room.
-Why don't you beIieve me?
Go to your room.
SCREWIE: What was aII that?
What's with the coppers?
-Someone stoIe Babe Ruth's bat.
-Good.
-Screwie, my dad got fired.
-Not good.
Why wouId someone steaI
Babe's Iucky bat?
The Yankees are gonna Iose
the Series for sure.
Whoa, kid, you're watching
way too many newsreeIs.
That Iucky bat stuff
is a bunch of maIarkey.
How do you know?
You were onIy in for one pitch.
Ooh, that hurt.
That guard had to take the bat.
Why wouId a Yankees security guard
steaI Babe Ruth's bat?
Now, if it were a Chicago Cubs
security guard, that I couId beIieve.
Wait a minute.
(EX CLAIMING)
SCREWIE: Hey, hey, hey, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
I stiII can't breathe.
Hey, I knew I'd seen that face before.
(SIGHS )
What are you babbIing about?
The security guard was Lefty Maginnis,
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs.
Lefty's the biggest cheater
who ever stepped on a mound.
Lefty stoIe the bat so Babe can't hit.
The Yankees wiII Iose the Series.
I've got to teII Dad.
Yeah, and don't forget to mention
that you heard it
from your friendIy neighborhood
taIking basebaII.
Kid, this is just a crazy theory
and even if it were true,
no one's gonna beIieve you.
You don't have any proof.
-Then I'II get some proof.
-How?
Most of the Cubs are heading for Chicago.
What're you gonna do?
Sneak out of the house,
go down to Penn Station,
and search every singIe passenger?
-Right.
-Oh, no.
If we go to Penn Station,
we may catch him there.
I got to Iearn to keep my mouth shut.
Whoa ! Oh!
This can't work. You're just a kid
and this is the reaI worId,
not some fantasy Iand
-fiIIed with gumdrop fairies and...
-You're coming with me.
Yeah, I think maybe not,
but thanks for the invite.
Screwie, I have to do this for my dad.
AII right, don't Iook at me...
Don't Iook at me Iike that.
Stop it, stop...
Okay, fine, Iet's make a deaI.
I'II heIp you to find the bat
if you take me back to the sandIot,
-and Ieave me to rot in peace. DeaI?
-DeaI.
Hmm.
(HEAVING)
Oh, whoa !
SCREWIE: What are we doing?

YANKEE: Uh-oh.
SCREWIE: What do you mean by ''uh-oh''?

-You were screaming pretty Ioud.
-I wasn't screaming.
I was Iaughing.
Ha ! See? Ha, ha, ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Laughing.
SCREWIE: There's a miIIion peopIe here.
How we gonna find Lefty?
Just keep Iooking, aII right?
CONDUCTOR: FIyer service to Niagara.
Track 18.
(CHATTERING)
YANKEE: We gotta hurry.
Why don't we come back in 10 years?
When you're taIIer.
Make way, there, foIks.
Coming through, coming through.
(HEAVING)
See anything yet?
SCREWIE: I see a sock, a candy wrapper,
a Life Saver covered in Iint.
-Hmm. PineappIe.
-Screwie. This is no time to fooI around.
Now do you see anything?
I see thousands of peopIe
going about their business,
none of which is ours.
There's onIy one train to Chicago,
so Lefty wiII have to be on it.
-We're gonna stake it out.
-''Stake it out''?
What, what, what,
now you're with the FBI?
WOMAN ON PA: AII aboard
for the County Peabody Express.
SCREWIE: Better off rotting up
in that sandIot.
I got to get stuck
with J. Edgar Hoover Junior, here.
How are we gonna cover the whoIe train?
There's Iike 50 cars and 100 passengers,
and... HoIy MackereI!
Bingo. That's got to be Babe's bat.
(EX CLAIMING)
(SPITTING)
(LAUGHING)
Okay, we found him. I'II give you that.
But anything couId be in that case.
A trombone, a wooden Ieg, a pogo stick.
WeII, there he goes,
so I guess we'II never know. Too bad.
-Come on, boys.
-AII aboard!
SCREWIE: Hey, wait, wait.
Where are you taking me?
MAN: Take a head count
when you get inside, okay?
(GASPING)
-I think that's him.
-Let's caII the cops.
I'm not sure. Take a cIoser Iook.
-Wow!
-Is it him?
There's a horse jumping off a diving board.
Wait, I think that's EIeanor RooseveIt.
Screwie, is it Lefty or not?
Take a quick Iook as you roII yourseIf back.
RoII myseIf back from...

-Oh, here she goes again.
-HeIp me, somebody. HeIp me.
(SOBBING) I'm not supposed to be here.
HeIp me!
SCREWIE: Whoa, sister, reIax.
You're a hunk of wood,
not the Hope Diamond.
Do you know who I am?
I am DarIin', honey. I'm the Babe's bat.
Born of a 1000-year-oId tree
on the side of Mount OIympus.
Struck by Iightning,
and carved by monks using
the horn of a unicorn.
Since when do monks make basebaII bats?
-Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
-No, of course not.
In fact, I was made
from the hide of Seabiscuit,
and stitched together by Betsy Ross!
Screwie was in the Major Leagues, too.
He'd have been a home run baII,
if he hadn't fouIed out.
-Oh.
-Kid, don't.
A fouI baII? ReaIIy?
WeII, isn't that impressive.
I've hit thousands of guys
that were better than you.
You know, you bats are aII prima donnas.
You onIy come out
three or four times a game,
carried to the pIate and back.
''Oh, don't Iet me Iay in this dirt.
Where's my batboy?''
WeII, here's what you know.
I don't need anybody to carry me around.
I can handIe myseIf. Put me down.
-Put me down!
-Whoa !
YANKEE: Okay.
So Iong, farm team.
Excuse me.
Two.
You know something?
If you think
I'm roIIing aII the way to Chicago,
you've got another thing coming.
You may pick me up.
If, in fact, you're rescuing me,
then I assume that you are returning me
to my rightfuI owner, Mr. Babe Ruth,
who, as I'm sure you're aware,
is currentIy in Chicago
pIaying in the WorId Series.
You have heard of the WorId Series,
haven't you, baII?
(IN A HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, yeah,
I've heard of the WorId Series.
But we ain't going to Chicago,
we're going to New York.
New York? Why?
I just toId you Babe is in Chicago.
When Lefty stoIe you, my dad got fired.
If I take you to New York,
then he'II get his job back.
Oh, no, no, no.
You gotta take me to Babe.
Hey, tabIe Ieg,
don't put any crazy ideas into his head.
We are not going to Chicago.
We are going to New York.
That's it. The basebaII has spoken.
-But...
-I said, ''The basebaII has spoken.''
Fine, that's aII right with me.
I just happen to know that
Mr. Babe Ruth is a generous man,
and I'm sure he couId get
your daddy's job back.
Maybe even with a big raise.
But y'aII want to go to New York,
we'II go to New York.
OnIy you can make that decision.
(SIGHING)
Oh, StanIey, where couId he be?
DAD: This is aII my fauIt.
I was too hard on him.
How wiII we ever find him?
I think it's time to caII the poIice.
(SINGING)
Ouch! Ouch!

(MEOWING)
(CRASHING)
Is that our train?
(YAWNING)
I don't think so.
Oh.

Kid, kid, wake up.
Wake up.
-Hey, what do you...
-Quiet.
Lefty's here.
Oh, no.
(SINGING)
Get it back some...
Oh, he's gonna be sorry.
I'II have a non-fat mochaccino, pIease.
(SHUSHING)
Quiet, tentpoIe. It's the bad guy.
...use his head for batting practice.
Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.
Babe Ruth, stop hitting yourseIf.
(PHONE RINGING)
SeriousIy, why are you
hitting yourseIf, Babe?
-What?
-HeIIo, Mr. Cross, it's Lefty Maginnis.
Ah! Lefty.
I've been expecting your caII
for severaI hours.
-From now on, we have to taIk in code.
-What?
Are you on the way to Cairo?
-I thought you wanted me in Chicago.
-It's ode-kay, you idiot-ay!
Do you have
our IittIe wooden friend with you?
Yeah, yeah, I've got the bat right here.
Listen.
-And no one even suspects us.
-Us?
RaouI, there is no ''us.''
If you get caught,
I don't know anything about this.
-AbsoIutamente not.
-No, Mr. Cross, I just meant
they bIamed it on some janitor and his kid.
Get this. They fired the guy.
(LAUGHING)
We're... I mean, I'm in the cIear.
So, now that I have the bat
I'm pitching in the Series, right?
Not so fast, RaouI.
When you make the deIivery,
we can discuss your compensation.
-Oh, but Mr. Cross.
-I Iook forward to seeing the package.
Oh, what's wrong, IittIe Babe Ruth
bobbIe-head? You don't approve?
You Iook a IittIe groggy. Are you?
WeII, perhaps you can use
a seventh-inning stretch.
(LAUGHING)
(COUGHING)
(EXHALING)
Yeah.
(EX CLAIMS )
(GRUNTING)
Ow.
Ow.
Wait tiII I get...
(CHUCKLES )
-Bottom of the ninth, kid.
-SCREWIE: Train!
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
SCREWIE: Yankee!
(SCREAMING)
HoIy cow!
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
(CRASHING)
LEFTY: (CRYING) Mama !
(HOOTING)
SCREWIE: Now, what?
DARLIN': We're going to Chicago, siIIy.
SCREWIE: We head for New York,
right, kid?
I don't know. Just Iet me think.
SCREWIE: Why don't we fIip a coin?
Heads, we go to New York.
TaiIs, we burn the bat.
Now, that was rude and uncaIIed for.
(HOWLING)
(GROWLING)
YANKEE: What's that?
-WoIves?
-WoIves?
We're in Pittsburgh.
WoIves are too scared
to come to Pittsburgh.
-SCREWIE: Oh, kid.
-Screwie!
SCREWIE: HeIp! HeIp!
DARLIN': Run, Yankee.
Forget him. Run. Save me.
SCREWIE: Don't eat me.
You don't know where I've been.
The stench!
I bet even dogs think you have dog breath.
(PANTING)
DARLIN': Ow!
-Hey.
-Screwie.
Screwie.
Remember, protect me at aII costs.
AII right, aII right.
I'm doing the best I can with what I got.
-Who are these guys?
-I think they're pirates.
-In PennsyIvania?
-Pittsburgh Pirates, okay?
(CRASHING)
(GASPING)
(BARKING)
Huh?
(STRINGS TWANGING)
(STAMMERING) Sorry.
I was just Iooking for my baII.
Oh, you mean this?
(BARKING)
-Whoa.
-Hey.
-Daisy, easy with that.
-SCREWIE: Come on, pIay dead.
Sit, sit. Oh, for crying out Ioud.
Don't worry, she won't go far.
Not with dinner aImost ready.
(LAUGHING)
Louie, I think we have a guest.
Mmm. This is good.
What's your name, son?
-Yankee Irving, sir.
-Yankee?
Yankee Irving. I Iike that name.
Hey, kid, it's a pIeasure to meet you.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Hey, hey, quit it, wiII you?
Hmm. Mmm.
(RADIO CRACKLING)
(GUITAR PLAYING)
-Are you guys...
-Bums?
(CHUCKLING) No.
-No, we're not bums.
-I'm a bum.
Yes, Jack's a bum.
But the rest of us
have just faIIen on hard times.
(STA TIC BUZZING)
Perfect.
Don't move a muscIe, Jack.
ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: ... for the
New York Yankees...
I got it! Hey, guys, the game is on!
The game. Babe.
-FinaIIy.
-Game's on!
Let's see if he can puII off a miracIe.
-Hit it.
-You can do it.
-Oh, come on, Babe.
-It's switched the defense. Strike two.
-No, no.
-Oh, no.
-Babe, come on.
-I can't Iisten to this.
-I can't Iisten to this.
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Come on, Babe.
-You can do it.
ANNOUNCER: ... it aII comes down
to this pitch.
Come on, Babe.
-Babe settIes into the box.
-Come on, Babe. Come on, Babe.
Here's the wind up. Here's the swing.
Strike three.
-Oh, no.
-Not again.
Struck out...
(CRASHING)
Oh, no.
-... in this fifth game of the WorId Series.
-See, I toId you he needed me.
Babe's never struck out this many times.
I shouId've returned you by now.
This is aII my fauIt.
-Hey, buck up, Yankee.
-There's aIways another game tomorrow.
And the Babe,
the Babe aIways bounces back.
Oh, come on, son.
Babe's got a big oId heart.
He won't Iet us down.
Look, when Babe was a kid,
he had nothing.
Then he picks up a bat, he starts swinging,
Iook where it got him.
If Babe can do it, so can we.
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)
Hey, guys, you hear that?
That's the 10:15 Manhattan Express
headed straight for New York.
AII right, Iet's pack it up.
We're moving out.
It's about time.
(BARKING)
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
Whoa !
Come on, Daisy. Come on.
That's it.
-Yankee!
-Come on, kid.
Come on, Yankee!
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
Grab on!
Yankee, come on!
Come on, son!
Yankee, come on, run. Keep running.
No, keep running.
Keep on running.
-Why is he not running?
-I don't know.
Sorry, guys, I can't go.
I've got to give Babe his bat back.
-What did he say?
-He said he's going to get his backpack.
-Bye.
-SCREWIE: Yankee, what're you doing?
You heard those guys. Babe's their hero.
Babe's everyone's hero,
and I can't Iet them down,
and I can't Iet my dad down.
-We're going to Chicago.
-Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
I knew you were gonna see this my way.
This is great. We had a deaI, Yankee.
And you, you rotten two-by-four,
this is aII your fauIt.
You tricked him.
You messed everything up.
Face it, Ieather face, you're beat.
Fine, I can't trust you.
I'II go back to New York on my own.
(HOWLING)
Whoa !
Yankee!
I guess a coupIe of days in Chicago
couIdn't hurt.
I've been curious
about their deep-dish pizza,
but after that I'm heading back
to the Big AppIe.
DARLIN': You know, I was just a spIinter
when I first read about it.
So after Babe and I
were presented to the court,
the Queen invited us to try our hand
at an EngIish sport.
And there was this cheeky cricket bat
who kept trying to Iook down my tape
and I... Why are we stopping?
'Cause I'm tired and hungry.
-You guys ever eat?
-No.
I've got to maintain this very trim figure.
Trim? Ha !
From where I'm sitting, I see Iots of grain.
-Are you saying I'm pIump?
-I'm saying you're fat, bat.
Excuse me, I have been examined
by scientists around the worId,
who can't figure out
how I can Iook this good
-and swing so weII.
-BIah, bIah, bIah, bIah.
Have these scientists done research
about your big mouth?
-Can you say the same, Scarface?
-I'm not gonna sit here
-and Iisten to this.
-DARLIN': I don't think so.
-(CHUCKLING) Hey, Iook, a basebaII.
-Hey, Iook, the missing Iink.
(CHUCKLING)
Put me down.
Hey...
(EX CLAIMS )
-Give him back.
-Him?
(SNORTING)
What did you do? Name it?
(CHUCKLING) What's he got?
A IittIe bed or something?
-Do you dress him up?
-Give him back.
-Give him back.
-Hey, Yankee.
-HeIp!
-Oh, Iet him have him, Yankee.
AII he does is compIain anyway.
We can find a baII with a better attitude.
Like a tennis baII.
They're aII warm and fuzzy.
(LAUGHING)
(EX CLAIMS )
-You, give him back that baII!
-Get Iost, Marti.
-Take that!
-Yeah, mind your own business.
(GRUNTS )
(CHUCKLING) Hey, kid,
you gonna Iet a girI fight for you?
No.
But I'II Iet her heIp.
(GASPING)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Let's get your baII back.
(GROANS )
Looks Iike we're fighting two girIs.
Ow.
(CHUCKLING) You got him
right in the head.
The kid's not even ducking.
DARLIN': Watch out.
-You gotta start dodging these appIes.
-I'm trying.
No, you're not.
Don't Iook where they're going.
You gotta watch
where they're starting from.
-Yeah, that's it.
-Okay.
What're you Iooking at me for?
Watch the appIes.
Don't you make me break out
my whuppin' stick.
SCREWIE: Incoming!
(YELLS )
I've been hit. I feeI Iike a Danish.
Come on.
Ow!
(GRUNTS )
AII right, just take your stupid baII.
(LAUGHING)
Yeah!
Oh!
Medic!
HoId me, I'm so coId.
Come on.
(RATTLING)
(HEAVING)
LEFTY: Ow!
(LAUGHING)
-Thanks for heIping me back there.
-No probIem.
You were reaIIy starting
to get the hang of it.
That Tubby TyIer
wiII be picking appIe seeds
out of his teeth for a week.
(LAUGHING)
-Whoa, you can reaIIy throw.
-''FastbaII'' is my middIe name.
My daddy taught me to pitch
when I was four years oId.
-ReaIIy?
-Come on, I'II show you.
-Hey, Mom, this is Yankee.
-Hi.
-HeIIo.
-PIeased to... Whoa !
HoIy mackereI.
(WHISTLING)
My heavens!
This is my dad right here.
He's a pitcher for the Cincinnati Tigers.
Your dad is Lonnie Brewster?
Lonnie ''The Rooster'' Brewster?
-The king of the curve baII?
-That's right.
(EX CLAIMS )
He can pitch to me anytime.
-I think I'm gonna pitch my Iunch.
-Whoa.
No-hitter in CIeveIand.
That was the ten-inning game
that he threw twenty strike-outs.
-Grand sIam in MiIwaukee.
-Yeah.
That was the game were my dad made
-two tripIe pIays.
-TripIe pIays.
-Your dad's incredibIe.
-Yeah, he sure is.
-He's my hero.
-My dad works at Yankee Stadium.
ReaIIy?
Do you ever dream of pIaying
at Yankee Stadium?
Oh, yeah, aII the time.
But I'm kind of in a sIump right now.
I'II never be good enough.
Yankee, did you run away from home?
I'm not running away. I'm on a mission.
This is Babe Ruth's bat.
That's not DarIin', is it?
Yeah. I have to get her to Babe,
in Chicago, right away.
Hey, maybe my dad can heIp.
His team is heading there tomorrow.
(KNOCKING)
-HeIIo. May I heIp you?
-HeIIo.
I've been worried sick about my son.
You know,
since he's my son and everything.
Just give this to my dad.
He's pIaying in ToIedo.
-Thanks.
-ROSETTA: Yankee, your dad's here.
Dad?
(GASPING)
Come on, son. Time to go.
-He's not my dad!
-MARTI: Run, Yankee.
-Out of my way.
-Marti!
(SNICKERING)
(GRUNTING)
-Are you okay?
-I'm aII right.
You stop it right there, Mister.
Whoa !
Whoa !
ROSETTA: Just you wait
tiII the poIice get here.
(EX CLAIMING)
(GROANS )
(HEAVING)
Oh!
MARTI: Run, Yankee!
(GROWLING)
Run, Yankee. Run!
Give me the bat. Give me the bat.
(SCREAMING)
Give me that bat.
(EX CLAIMS )
(HEAVING)
Okay, kid, you've had your fun.
-Now give me the bat back.
-No.
I'm taking her to Chicago,
and giving her back to Babe.
-You teII him, Yank.
-I stoIe this thing fair and square.
My dad's gonna get his job back.
Yeah, weII, I want my job back.
I'm a pitcher. I pitch.
What does a janitor do? Janit?
(EX CLAIMS )
Oh, oh, my nose...
(HEAVING)
Oh!
Take that, you bum.
(CHUCKLING)
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.
Marti, I just want to say...
Mmm-hmm?
-I want the bat.
-Yankee,
-Iet's get out of here.
-The bat.
-Go find my dad.
-Where's the bat?
-See you Iater, Yankee.
-Where's the bat? Where's the bat?
Thanks, Marti!
Gimme the bat.
(GROANING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Why can't you stay
on your side of the pack?
Because if I stay on that side,
I'II get aII wet
-and I don't wanna get aII swoIIen.
-You know, you're right.
-You are getting swoIIen.
-Where, where?
In your big fat bat head.
Oh, you are gonna get it.
You and that horse you came off of.
SCREWIE: Oh, is that a threat?
Give me your best swing.
DARLIN': My best swing,
and your stitches are gonna need stitches.
WiII you two just knock it off!
(SNIFFLING)
-WeII, what's wrong with him?
-I'II teII you what's wrong with him.
He's a ten-year-oId kid,
stuck in the middIe of nowhere
with a seIfish bat
who treats him Iike a pack muIe.
-I do not treat him Iike a pack muIe.
-Oh, yeah?
Ever thank him for saving you from Lefty,
or carting you aII the way back
to Chicago?
I...
(SOBBING)
Yankee, it occurs to me
that I have not properIy thanked you
from saving me from that ruffian,
Lefty Maginnis,
and carrying me aII this way.
-That's okay.
-No, it most certainIy is not.
My mama wouId just be mortified
at my behavior,
and I just want to teII you how much
I appreciate what you're doing for me.
(SNIFFING)
Yankee, is there something eIse
bothering you?
-I miss my mom and dad.
-You know what?
Sometimes, Babe misses his famiIy
when he's on the road, too.
Why?
He's surrounded by reporters
and fans and everything.
That's true, but they're not there
'cause they're his friends.
They just hang around 'cause he's famous.
You know something?
You remind me a Iot of Babe.
-Oh, pIease.
-ReaIIy?
Oh, yes. You know, I beIieve
he's gonna Iike meeting you.
Thanks, DarIin'.
No, no. Thank you, Yankee.
Oh, brother.
You couId pour this stuff on pancakes.
CROSS: Here's the windup, and the pitch.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
It's a home run! The crowd goes wiId!
They're going nuts in Chicago!
(IMITATING ECHO) I'd Iike to thank
aII the IittIe peopIe.
But especiaIIy myseIf!
(PHONE RINGING)
-What?
-Mr. Cross.
-It's Lefty.
-CROSS: Lefty, my boy, the pIan is working.
The Series is virtuaIIy in the bag.
-Where are you?
-Where am I? I'm on the...
I'm on the phone in ToIedo, Ohio.
I... I just needed to change trains.
Do you have the at-bay with you?
The bat is...
It's on its way to Chicago, boss.
If the bat's on its way,
but you're in ToIedo,
I'm feeIing Iike you're not being
compIeteIy honest with me, Lefty.
You don't have the bat, do you?
-I'm... I...
-You moron!
There's one game Ieft in this Series.
If I don't have that bat in my paws
before it starts,
you don't have a job, Lefty. AII right?
You know what I think?
-I think there's troubIe with this Iine, boss.
-HeIIo?
-I think the phone isn't working!
-Operator. Operator?
-Can you hear me, boss?
-Operator.
-HeIIo! HeIIo!
-Lefty, heIIo?
(CLANGING)
-What a jerk!
-CROSS: What was that, Lefty?
-I said the phone doesn't work.
-Lefty.
-Work!
-Who has the bat?
-Doesn't work!
-I said who has it, Lefty?
-Work! Work! Work!
-HeIIo?
(SCREAMING)
CROSS: Fine.
WouId you autograph
my program, pIease?
Sure thing, miss.
Hey!
(CHEERING)
Hey, now. Hey. HeIIo. Oh, hi!
-HeIIo, thank you so much.
-Hey, bat girI, they're not cheering for you.
Oh, but they shouId be.
Gee, Mr. Brewster,
wouId you sign this for us, pIease?
-Sure. Sure, kids.
-Thank you.
-Yes!
-There you go.
You keep on rooting for us, aII right?
-Thank you, Mr. Brewster.
-Thank you.
-See you soon...
-Excuse me, Mr. Brewster?
Cap, Iet's go.
(CHUCKLING)
AII right, Hank. AII right.
Yankee fan, huh?
Your boys gonna be abIe
to puII themseIves out of the fire?
-What do you mean?
-Yankees Iost again Iast night.
-Got beat bad.
-Oh, no!
-Lost again?
-Yup. The Series is aII tied up.
OnIy one game Ieft.
(ENGINE STARTING)
(CHEERING)
AII right, WiIIie.
Let's get something going here.
-Watch your head, son.
-Whoa !
I couId have caught that

(LAUGHING)
What are they doing?
Oh, my gosh! They're mimes.
Get me out of here.
Never seen anyone
pIay shadow baII before, huh?
Keeps us on top of our game.
Hey, everybody. This is Yankee Irving
and he's riding with us to Chicago.
How're you doing, Yankee?
-Hey, WiIIie, are we stiII pIaying?
-Yankee here's gonna pinch hit for me.
-You think you can handIe it?
-I can hit anything Hank can throw.
MAN: Get on up there, hip-pockets.
MAN 2: WeIcome to the big Ieagues, son.
-Batter up.
-Yankee...
(LAUGHING)
Hey, just a minute, y'aII.
Look here, son,
your stance has got aII kinds of styIe.
Yeah, you Iook good.
You just ain't gonna hit nothing.
HaIf of hittin' is baIance.
You get your feet set right and
you couId hit anything you can reach.
(RAPMUSIC PLA YING ON RADIO)
Keep your knees bent
and your head down.
(EX CLAIMING)
I'm not sure I can take much more of this.
-Hey, hey.
-Yank's got a basebaII right here.
What happened to the invisibIe baII?
(EX CLAIMING)
Oh, reIax, you knuckIe baII.
How can something so round
be so square?
-Whoa !
-BaIance, that's the key to hittin' the baII.
(CHUCKLING)
Now you're getting it.
Whoa !
I'm afraid of heights!
I got it, I got it, I got it.
That was kind of fun,
but don't do it again, okay?
What am I saying? That was fun.
Whoa ! Come on.
(WHOOPING)
Come on, put some pepper on me.
(EX CLAIMING)
I want more. Give me more!
I'm a screwbaII!
(CHUCKLING)
He Iooks Iike a pro.
-Look at you. You've got great form.
-ReaIIy?
Look at me, Yank.
(WHOOPING)
Coming through. Look at this.
Yippety-do! Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, now you go ahead,
you show them how to do it.
Here comes the gas.
This is easy. I can do this.
-That's the way you swing it!
-AII right. Yeah!
-Did you see me? I did it!
-We're having fun now.
MAN: Oh, this boy means business.
DARLIN': This is a IittIe tiny Babe
right here.
(SNORING)
Wow.
Look, son.
The Yankees aIways stay at this hoteI.
You're gonna be okay here.
I want you to go inside
and caII your daddy.
I wiII, Mr. Brewster.
-And thanks for everything.
-So Iong, sIugger.
-MAN: Bye-bye now, Yankee.
-Bye, guys. See you Iater.
MAN 2: I'II be seeing you, hip-pockets.
MAN 3: Take care, kid.
YANKEE: Good Iuck.
Oh! Ah!
YANKEE: Wow.
SCREWIE: (WHISTLING) Some joint.
Poor Babe.
He must be devastated without me.
(DINGING)
MAN 1 : Hey, Babe! Hey, Babe!
MAN 2: Hey, Babe!
(BABE SINGING)
Hey, how are you foIks? Good to see you.
Babe Ruth.
That's Babe!
That's my Babe! Look at Babe!
Get him to sign me.
Maybe I'II be worth something someday.
BABE: Hey, good to see you.
How've you been?
(CHUCKLING)
REPORTER: Hey, Babe. When are
you Yankees gonna turn it around, huh?
Hey, basebaII is fuII of surprises.
Anything can happen.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Hey, Babe,
smiIe for the camera.
I beIieve the ragamuffin convention
is in the aIIey behind the hoteI.
But I need to see Babe.
As do severaI hundred other basebaII fans.
-MAN: I thought you said this is...
-Hey.
(CHATTERING)
(LAUGHING)
(CHUCKLING) Hey, Lou.
Get a Ioad of this kid.
-You IittIe ruffian!
-I toId you...
-No, no. Let me go. I just got to see Babe.
-This hoteI is not for snotty-nosed brats...
Hey, Mr. D. Bring that kid back over here.
Hey, kid, you hungry?
(LAUGHING)
(GRUNTS )
But Mr. Ruth, this hoteI is for guests onIy.
Yeah, weII, he's my guest.
-Yes, sir, but...
-Bring him a banana spIit or something.
-Bring me one, too.
-Hey, what're you doing?
Hey, oy. Yankee! She, she...
But she... DarIin'!
Hey, Yankee... Hang on, DarIin'!
This Iooks Iike a job for SuperbaII!
Up, up and away!
-So, what's your name, kid?
-Yankee Irving, sir.
Hey, you got spunk, you know that?
He reminds me of me back in the day.
Babe, I need to taIk to you about DarIin'.
WeII, they don't get it right in the papers.
DarIin' and I, we...
We had something speciaI.
You know, kid,
I'd never say this to anyone,
but it was aImost Iike I couId teII her
right where I wanted to hit the baII
and she'd make it happen.
(CHUCKLING)
-Kind of crazy, right?
-Babe, I have DarIin'.
You have DarIin'?
AII right then, hand her over.
SCREWIE: Get your hands off her!
(EX CLAIMING)
Ow!
The dumber they are, the harder they faII.
I was once the prettiest pine in the forest.
Babe aIways used to say,
''DarIin' you couId be a Christmas tree.''
BeautifuI story, princess.
Now Iet's get out of here.
(GROANING)
You roII, I'II steer.
(HEAVING)
Huh?
Hey, what is this? Some kind of joke?
That's not my bat.
And unIess you have a pound of roast beef,
that's not even Iunch.
Babe, I just had her.
She was right here in my backpack.
Lefty Maginnis stoIe her.
I brought her aII the way back here
from New York.
I got to find her.
SCREWIE: Just roII... Just...
(GASPING)
-Yank.
-DarIin'!
-Hurry, Yank.
-You got to get... You!
HeIIo.
(DARLIN' SCREAMING)
DARLIN': HeIp! HeIp!
HeIp!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(LAUGHING)
(GASPING)
(HEAVING)
-DARLIN': HeIp! HeIp!
-Drive the car!
(CHEERING)
So tragic.
The indomitabIe, the unfIappabIe,
the amazing Babe Ruth's Iast turn at pIate
and no magic bat to reIy on.
WiII he go down in three pitches,
do you think?
-Yank, don't Iisten to him.
-Yeah. He's just an angry IittIe troII.
He doesn't need a magic bat.
ReaIIy? And yet you tried so hard
to return it to him.
What do you say we Iisten to the radio
and see what's happening?
ANNOUNCER: And it Iooks Iike the Cubs
have the Championship in the bag.
The Yankees traiI the Cubs
six to nothing with no men on...
-Come on, Babe.
-Babe Ruth is at the pIate.
Come on.
Here's the pitch. Swing, and strike three.
That's going to send Babe
back to the bench.
Oh, my Babe.
Which now Iooks more Iike
a funeraI parIor. The Yankees Iook beat,
and with onIy two outs to go,
they probabIy are.
WeII, I beIieve that's gonna do it
for your Yankees, Yankee.
(LAUGHING)
Oh... I suppose
this bat's not much of a threat now.
I hope you get spIinters everywhere.
Of course there's aIways next year.
Maybe I'II take her
to my cabin on the Iake.
There're some beavers there
that'd Iove to make her acquaintance.
Give it a IittIe nibbIe.
(IMITATING NIBBLING)
I suppose I shouId be heading down to the
fieId to accept my WorId Series trophy.
You just stay put, IittIe Yankee.
I'm sure your parents have given up
Iooking for you by now.
The orphanage shouId be here any minute
to pick you up.
Just waIk in saying,
''I'm the boy who Iost Babe Ruth's bat
and cost him the WorId Series.
''How're you foIks doing?''
SIeep on that, Yankee.
(LAUGHING)
(COUGHING)
So what's the pIan, Yank?
-There is no pIan, Screwie.
-You mean we're winging it?
-Great. What do we do first?
-Nothing.
There is nothing we can do.
Don't you get it? It's over.
Babe struck out. We faiIed.
You were right, Screwie. I'm just a kid.
I shouId have just quit.
That's it? You're Iaying down your bat?
You know, when I Ianded in that sandIot,
I thought, ''That's it.
There's nothing Ieft to do but rot.''
But then you came aIong.
And there was aII this...
This jumping on trains,
and the thing with the appIes
and pIaying baII with the Tigers.
You made a beIiever out of me.
I wasn't right, kid. Not at aII.
So what, the Yankees Iose a game?
Is that why you did this?
So Babe can set his miIIionth record?
Did Babe teach you how to throw?
Is Babe gonna pay your famiIy's rent?
Why did you do this, Yankee? Why?
-To heIp my dad.
-Then the game's not over, Yankee.
Are you gonna keep swingin'?
I thought basebaII
was a fieId of broken dreams.
I'm not taIking about basebaII.
I'm taIking about famiIy.
-DarIin', we gotta...
-I heard everything he said.
Yankee, I wouId be honored to heIp save
your Daddy's job.
And here I thought you were
a hard-hearted oId crank.
-AII right...
-And now I come to find out
that under that tough Ieather sheII
is just a gooey carameI center.
-Enough aIready.
-Fine.
UnIess, of course,
you've got something eIse you wanna say.
You did good, basebaII.
Thanks, bat.
-So how're we getting out of here?
-The window.
-It doesn't open.
-Don't you get it? BasebaII. Window.
Smasharoonie.
Screwie, are you sure?
Look at me.
I'm covered in stitches aIready.
Now, Iet's smash some gIass!
(YELLING)
Okay, I think
we're softening up the gIass a IittIe.
Try again.
(CHUCKLING)
(GRUNTING)
PIay baII!
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Screwie, where are you?
(GROANING)
Don't worry about me. Get to the Babe.
I'II be aII right.
Hey, a fouI baII.
I just can't shake that, can I?
Whoa !
Hey, watch it, watch it! Hey!
Whoa !
(EX CLAIMING)
(EX CLAIMING)
(YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
You see, basebaII is about teamwork,
a certain IeveI of dignity...
What the?
MAN: Hey, kid!
MAN 2: Stop that kid.
MAN 3: Don't go down there.
Lou, that kid, I... I know that kid.
You remember that kid. That's the...
That, that... It's that kid.
ANNOUNCER: Wait a minute.
There seems to be some sort of
commotion deveIoping in the stands.
The ushers are chasing someone
through the crowd.
I can't quite see who it is.
WeII, the ushers appear to be chasing
a boy carrying a basebaII bat.
He Iooks to be about 10 years oId.
He's wearing a Yankees basebaII cap,
(SIREN WAILING)
and Iet me teII you, foIks,
he's reaIIy giving the Cubs personneI
a run for their money.
(CROWD GASPING)
(GROANING)
GUARD: Hey, kid!
(PANTING)
Strike three! What the hey?
-Move! Move!
-Come on! Come on!
Aren't you pIaying, huh, Yank?
Hey, kid. What are you doing here?
Come here, get off the fieId!
-I just need to get this to Babe.
-Hey, hey.
Hey, what're you trying to do?
(HEAVING)
WeII, weII, weII. I'm...
It's reaIIy my DarIin'.
-It's my Babe.
-Babe, here she is.
-Just Iike I toId you.
-No! Stop! Umpire.
I demand you caII this game immediateIy,
if not sooner, 'cause of shenanigans.
Yeah, not so fast, short stuff.
Your man Lefty stoIe my bat.
Is that your bat? I didn't...
-TeII him, Babe. You teII him.
-What?
That's the most absurd thing
I've ever heard!
Isn't that a penaIty? ShouIdn't they forfeit?
Yankees, you got two minutes
to get your batter in the box
or you'II forfeit the game.
AII right, right.
HoId your... HoId your horses.
-MAN: It's not okay. We're in bad shape.
-Yankee. Yankee.
Do you notice where you're standing, boy?
Home pIate in the middIe
of the WorId Series.
Now how does that feeI, sIugger?
You're Iooking good, Yankee.
-Don't you think so, Babe? Babe? Babe!
-DarIin'.
-Big man, Iook over here!
-DarIin'.
-What are you doing?
-I'm caIIing to Babe.
Yeah, Iook at this team.
We Iook Iike we're aIready beat.
Who can we put at the pIate
that wiII set this pIace on its ear?
Keep this team from
throwing in the toweI.
DARLIN': Look at the boy
standing on home pIate.
Ain't he something? Listen.
Hey! You hear me taIking to you?
-Huh?
-Why don't you put him in the game?
Babe, Iook at us.
(CHUCKLING)
I know who's gonna bat. Him.
Babe, forget it. This isn't LittIe League.
It's the WorId Series.
He's just a kid.
This kid brought DarIin' from New York
to Chicago aII by himseIf.
If he can do that, he can do anything.
Come on, guys. This is basebaII.
Anything can happen.
What do you say?
Hmm.
AII right, Yankees. Time's up.
Who's your hitter?
-Him. There's our hitter.
-Huh?
-What?
-UMPIRE: PIay baII!
(STAMMERING) I... I don't know about this.
You are about to bat in the WorId Series!
(LAUGHING)
I guess you guys reaIIy are desperate.
(LAUGHING)
(WHEEZING)
I know, I have no strike zone,
so don't swing.
Of course you swing.
Here, you can use my DarIin'.
But, Babe,
nobody's ever used DarIin' but you.
Yeah, weII...
(CHUCKLING)
I don't want her to hear this,
but it's not reaIIy the bat,
it's the batter.
Now go get them, kid.
So what's happening? What did I miss?
-Yankee's gonna pinch hit.
-What?
I mean, what a great idea ! Wow!
Who came up with that one?
Because that's a beauty, boy.
-Screwie!
-You can do it, Yankee,
and I'II be right here the whoIe time
to taIk you through it.
Batter up!
SCREWIE: Whoa ! Scratch that.
I'II be right here.
(LAUGHING)
I thought it was supposed to be Babe,
not a baby.
ANNOUNCER: WeII, sports fans,
the Yankees have put
a 10-year-oId boy in as the pinch hitter.
-A boy? What, are they kidding?
-Oh, I'm being given a name
for the young rookie.
-It's Yankee Irving.
-Yankee Irving?
Now batting for the New York Yankees,
number one, Yankee Irving.
-That's my boy!
-Yankee?
MAN: They're putting him in the game.
DAD: Yankee. Yankee.
Okay, Lefty, aII you have to do
is strike the kid out.
Just finish it!
Okay, kid, you're about to Iose
a whoIe Iot of baby teeth.
SettIe in, Yank. You can do this!
Don't just stand there, you gotta swing.
Strike one!
Okay, now you know
he's throwing strikes. Be ready.
He can do it.
(GASPING)
Watch me, now, watch me!
CurvebaII! CurvebaII! Swing!
-Strike two!
-Darn!
Come on now, sugar.
I cannot swing myseIf.
DAD: Yank!
MOM: Yankee.
MOM: Yankee, we're here!
DAD: We're here!
-Yank!
-Yank, we're here!
Mom? Dad?
-Just swing!
-Just swing!
(CHUCKLING)
BREWSTER: You get your feet set right,
you can hit anything you can reach.
MARTI: Keep your eye on the baII.
JACK: If Babe can do it, so can you.
-Oh, my.
-Time for the booger baII.
(SNORTING)
(BLOWING NOSE)
(CHUCKLING)
I can't beIieve you just bIew
your nose on me.
Come on, Yankee.
Take your time. Focus!
(HEAVING)
(GRUNTS )
Uh-oh.
(WHOOPING)
I'm going! I'm going! I'm not going.
Run!
(CHEERING)
ANNOUNCER: And he hit it!
The kid hit the baII!
Go, go, go, go, go.
It's a short bIooper
and Irving is sprinting to first base!
I said I got it.
It saiIs right past TayIor,
the first baseman.
Go for second! Go for second!
ANNOUNCER: Irving rounds first base
as TayIor and CuyIer chase it down.
SIide, Yankee!
Irving is rounding second
and is barreIing towards third,
but I don't think he's gonna make it, foIks.
-DAD: Go, Yankee, go!
-Come on, Yankee! Go!
Move it! Move it!
Lefty Maginnis is covering... HoIy cow!
-Irving just...
-Look at that kid go, huh?
-Come on, Yankee!
-Go, Yankee, go!
Oh, this is gonna be cIose, foIks.
HedIey has come up with the baII
and Iooks to home pIate.
-The fun's over, you IittIe runt!
-Trip him ! Somebody!
-The boy is not sIowing down!
-Not this time, punk!
SCREWIE: SIide!
(GRUNTS )
Or not sIide!
(YELLING)
Safe!
(CHEERING)
-Way to go!
-AII right, Yankee!
How about that kid, huh?
Oh, no! No!
That's a IittIe Tiger if I ever seen one.
He did it! That's my Yankee!
ALL: Yankee! Yankee! Yankee!
Hey, Yank! We're coming down!
We're coming down!
That's my friend!
Ow! Ow!
Oh, that's me.
-We did it, DarIin'.
-No, you did it.
Like Babe said,
''It's not the bat, it's the batter.''
Listen to them, kid! They Iove you!
They're cheering for you, too, Screwie!
Can you beIieve it? I'm a home run baII!
Yahoo!
You aIways were.
BABE: Way to go, kid.
Thanks, Babe.
MOM: Yankee.
DAD: Yankee.
-Yankee.
-Yankee.
Mom ! Dad!
-I did it, Dad. I did it.
-I aIways knew you couId do it.
-You just kept swinging.
-Just Iike you taught me, Dad.
SCREWIE: Yankee's home run sparked
the New York raIIy that scored seven runs.
Babe himseIf drove in four.
And when the Cubs came to bat,
they went down, one, two, three.
Just Iike that.
The Yankees won the WorId Series.
And it just goes to show you,
you can be the smaIIest,
you can be the weakest,
you can be the worst pIayer on the fieId,
but when peopIe teII you you're no good,
and say you shouId give it up,
you know what you do?
You just keep on swinging.
-(CHUCKLING) HeIIo!
-Hey!
(WHOOPING)
Yeah!
(BARKING)
Uh-oh.
(YELLING)
(LAUGHING)
AII right, aII right. That's enough.
AII right, Yankee.
That's enough, that's enough.
(WHOOPS )
