ADMISSION
An admissions officer
must have a strong constitution...
to be on the receiving end of...
..-an entire nation's application panic.
To endure the frustration and anger
of all the so-called millennial parents,
who just realized...
- Come on, hurry up!
- God, mom, relax.
There isn't room
for every perfectly nurtured,
organically fed,
well-tutored offspring.
OK, I'm your tour guide.
There's no point
in trying to impress me.
I have absolutely no power
over your fate here.
The people with the power
are right in there.
The Admissions officers.
And no,
that sign is not an omen.
Except for some of you.
Almost all of you, actually.
We had twenty six thousand,
two hundred and forty one
applications last year.
One thousand, three hundred
and eight of those applicants...
are attending school here.
James, tours leave at 9:15.
It is 9:25.
Sorry, I thought I'd wait.
We had a late arrival.
I'm sorry, our GPS lied.
No worries, Mrs...
...Lafont.
Welcome to Princeton.
So what's the secret
to getting in?
The secret.
Just be yourself.
If this is the right place for you,
then this is where you'll end up.
- James?
- Ok, let's go see Princeton.
We're going to play
a fun game.
It's called spot
the Nobel Prize winner.
What's the secret
to getting in?
There has to be one, right?
Well, there is.
But I can't tell you.
Not yet.
What I can tell you
is everyone thinks we're sadists.
That we like saying no.
This is not true.
- No.
- Portia.
No no no.
You're second reader
on my territory this season.
Yes, I know.
As are you on mine.
That's the way it works.
I'll just wail
until you catch up with me.
We are in this job
for one reason.
- Hello?
- Is this Portia Nathan?
To say.
Yes.
Wow, I didn't think I'd gel you.
It's John Pressman...
...from the New Quest School
in Keene, New Hampshire.
OK.
Yeah, I sent you a few e-mails
and left a couple messages.
Listen, thank you for calling.
Can you please e-mail me your information
and I will call you back?
Hey, not so rough.
How'd you like
to have your udder yanked like that?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, I was just talking to a student.
People, everyone, please.
I have a couple
of announcements.
There is an announcement.
Portia,
we're a new developmental school...
and we have our first
graduating class this year.
I know you're going to be making
your school visits in the next few weeks.
I'd like for you
to visit our campus.
Our kids would gain a lot from it
and I think you would too.
Right, I will look into it.
Gotta go.
You know,
I went to Dartmouth, same time as you.
Bye.
Thank you for calling.
So we're breaking records
in application numbers, naturally...
...because we've been
number one for so long.
Number one until today.
Princeton has just fallen
to number two.
What this means
is that we all have to work harder than ever...
...because I want to go out on top.
Yes,
you see the rumors are true.
I've decided to retire.
And pass the baton
to a worthy successor.
I'm spending an extra four days
in the Andover-Hotchkiss triangle.
And I've added five full days to the San Francisco
Bay Area and Northern California.
And I've added a number
of new schools.
In fact, I was just talking
to the co-founder of Quest.-.
...a developmental high school
with their first year of college applicants.
Clarence,
we're going to be back on lop.
We're going to make that happen.
By working together.
Right, Portia?
Absolutely.
As a mother myself,
I know the importance of teamwork.
And I am not a mother,
but I know the importance of it loo.
Can't go it alone.
Good.
Because you two
are my superstars...
...and nothing would make me happier
than if one of you...
.-.were to have this office next year-.
OK.
Class of 2016.
Pediatric surgery best combines
my love of children...
...of science, and my desire
to give back to my community.
Yes, but you didn't challenge
yourself academically.
B's in Physics
and you didn't take AP Chem.
UNLIKELY
Princeton's awesome.
Since 1841, every male in my family
has attended the place.
Student Body President.
And gymnastics
national champion.
Educated family.
Privileged upbringing.
Unfair advantage?
2400 on the SAT. 4.5 GPA.
And my poetry,
written in my mother's psych ward...
...will be published by Knopf.
And my father is Cuban.
And in a wheelchair.
- Can I gel some advice?
- No.
Applicalus interruptus.
You know the rule.
Never start a folder
if you can't finish it.
I have to start over anyway.
OK.
This kid from Alaska,
Aput Kunayak.
High grades,
but low scores.
President of ten clubs,
but that might be because of his ADD.
We want to accept people
who will succeed here.
You know, I once fought for a bipolar Inuit girl
and she lasted nineteen days.
- Do you think he might fail?
- Maybe.
I like him.
It's so hard.
You can't take it
so personally.
You have to toughen up
or you won't last here either.
Now outsies.
I'm swamped.
Portia?
I hope it's you.
Thank you.
Back to work.
Portia!
Hello?
Portia?
Portia? Portia...
I'm so sorry,
I've got an emergency.
Can you just watch the kids
while I run to the vet?
Because Richard's
at his Faulkner seminar.
Me?
Well, Mark should have been home
twenty minutes ago,
and it's our poetry night, and...
...really, I'm the last person
you want watching your kids.
Quiet!
- Did someone die?
- Rachael's dog is sick.
She begged me.
Good times.
- I've got essays to grade.
- No.
It's OK.
Mommy's here.
What did you do to them?
Rachael,
you know Portia's not good with kids.
It's not her fault.
Kids just don't take
to some people.
I don't know
what you were thinking.
Sorry, he's right.
They're like pit bulls.
They can smell fear.
Good night.
Take them all.
You know, if I gel Clarence's job,
this will be my last travel season.
Lovely and wonderful.
I've got everything planned out.
I'll be back in time for the department lunch.
And I've ordered everything,
you just need to pick up the...
...chicken and I will stop and get
the famous bean salad on my way home.
The famous bean salad.
Is that horrible Woolf woman
going to be there?
Helen is the preeminent
Virginia Woolf scholar.
It was quite a coup
to get her from Cambridge.
But I think
she has other plans.
Lovely and wonderful.
I like this life.
- I do, I do.
- Good. So do I.
It's so wonderfully...
...simple.
Well, we're simple folk.
Woof!
Excuse me?
You just patted me
on the head like a dog.
Did I?
Good doggie.
Hi.
Thank you so much for coming.
My pleasure.
We love Deerfield students.
I'm so pleased.
Good.
- Can I help you bring in your things?
- Yes, please.
Princeton.
In the nation's service
and in the service of all nations.
So, you all want to know
the secret formula for getting in, right?
Take out your pens.
Write this down.
There is no secret formula.
Left on Pony Run Drive.
But I will tell you
what not to do.
No champagne,
no baked goods,
and when you phone,
it is noted in your file.
So put the reins
on those eager parents of yours.
We're looking for passion.
Whatever it's for,
doesn't matter.
Passion.
Right on Shady Lane.
Does that mean every Princeton
undergraduate is a genius or a prodigy?
Absolutely not.
Although we certainly
wouldn't hold it against you.
Almost enough for everybody.
Recalcu Eating.
Recalculating. Recalculating-.
Make a U turn
as soon as possible.
The New Quest School
No Service
HEY-
Hi.
Portia Nathan,
Princeton Admissions office.
I know. I'm John.
Yes, and you said
you went to Dartmouth?
Yeah, and my dad,
and his dad, and his dad.
A legacy-
A legacy of what,
I'm not really sure.
So you're chopping
some wood here?
I'm showing them how to build
a sustainable irrigation system.
This is my third world
development class.
Well, nice axe.
Great axe.
- So let's gel to it.
- Yeah.
Hi there.
You all want to know the secret formula
for getting in, right?
Well, take out your pens.
Take them out.
Yes?
I'll tell you what I'd like to know.
Why should I apply
to an elitist institution...
.-.with a history of anti-black, anti-gay,
and anti-female oppression?
Well, actually,
I reject that stereotype-
Speaking of rejection,
don't you reject 99.9 percent
of your applicants?
And don't you just want to drum up applications
to keep your number one position...
on U.S. News
and World Report?
Well actually,
I think it's number two this year, right?
- Yes, but-
- No, I'm sure it's an aberration.
Don't people just need
a college degree if you want lo pursue...
the societally
approved definition of success?
Yeah, wouldn't you be better
off sitting in your room reading books...
instead of spending all that money?
I'm sorry, _
are you a senior?
No, I'm in sixth grade.
Yeah, Portia,
this is my son, Nelson.
I'm adopted.
I was born in Uganda.
- Love you, buddy.
- OK, dad.
I thought it would be educational
for him to sit in on this.
How's it going so far?
Are you learning a lot?
Kind of.
Half and half.
- Well there you go.
- OK. Right.
Well, Nelson, sure...
sitting in a room and reading books
would be very cost effective, but-
Princeton is a corporation.
No different
than an oil company.
We should be educating ourselves
to be citizens of the world...
and not of some guarded
suburban enclave.
What we want is to leave the planet
better than we found it.
OK. Well.
Good luck with that.
Wail, wait.
I want to hear about Princeton, please.
OK, fine.
But first, I have a question for all of you.
Just how will you leave
the planet better?
Will you eradicate disease?
You're going to need a medical degree.
If you want to create new drug therapies,
that's a PhD.
Do you want to defend the innocent
and secure justice for all?
I regret to inform you
that you will have to go to law school.
There are plenty
of college graduates out there...
...ardently hoping to leave the world
better than they found it.
We are looking
for those people!
Students with blazing minds
and hearts who will change the goddamn world!
All right, Portia.
Well done!
I bet you guys
feel like bunch of assholes.
Sorry,
I probably should have warned you.
Sorry,
I probably should have warned you.
We tend to encourage
that sort of spirited debate here.
But you did well.
You can hit a curveball.
You know, I'd really like
to introduce you to somebody.
This is Jeremiah Balakian.
He's a very special student.
My parents work in a mini-mart.
They're not very educated.
Do you think that matters?
Of course not.
It's your application.
Maybe I should apply then.
Princeton seems like a cool place.
It's very cool.
So you're saying
I should apply?
You know,
I'm not really your typical student.
My brain sort of goes
on a little Walkabout, you know?
Yes, you should apply.
And if you would like
to visit the campus...
...we can match you up with an undergrad
and you can spend the night in his room.
That sounds great.
Then you could hang out
and gel to know each other.
Well, I don't really hang out
with the applicants.
- That's not how it works.
- Right.
Because
there's over twenty thousand of them.
Exactly.
Still,
I think you should gel to know this one.
So, Portia,
like the Merchant of Venice?
Yes.
My mother thought if she named me
that I would grow up to be wise.
I'm lucky
she didn't name me Athena.
Or Minerva.
Or Sophie.
Except a lot of people
are named Sophie.
They probably don't even know
what their name means.
Or Metis.
That would be really strange.
Or if your name was Aushenaya
or lﬂok or Saraswati.
I think you got lucky.
If you had to be called something
that stands for wisdom.
Well, thanks for this.
I have to go.
I have robotics class.
- Interesting kid.
- He's a great kid.
He's become
like part of my family.
I met him at a garage sale.
He was reading a law
encyclopedia.
We went and had coffee
and talked for five hours.
He's a prodigy.
Well, be sure to include all of that
in your recommendation.
Bye.
So how long have you been
at Princeton?
Since college.
Sixteen years.
Wow, that's a long time
to stay in one place.
Are you married?
No I live with someone.
- Chair of the English Department.
- Kids?
Thousands.
Can you get these cows
out of the way?
I doubt it.
They're enormous.
That one's pregnant.
Where do you stay
while you're here?
My morn lives
about ten miles away.
Mom?
It's me.
Who?
How many people
call you morn?
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?
I left a message.
I was visiting a school nearby.
K never check
my messages.
That's a good policy.
Thought Yd spend the night
if it's a“ right with you.
I've got to gel up very early,
and then hit a few schools and race back...
...for Mark's
department lunch.
How can you stand
those English Department gatherings?
What could be more dull?
Sometimes you make sacrifices for the person
you've been living with for ten years.
That's what a healthy relationship is.
Thank god
I'm not in one of those.
Yes.
Thank god.
If I had to do what I was supposed to be doing
every minute of my life, like you do...
...I'd kill myself.
Did you just say if you were me
you would kill yourself?
Portia, don't' exaggerate.
I'm working on my bike.
You know, they actually have stores
where you can buy bikes already made.
And did you know that women
are the only exploited group in history...
...to have been idealized
into powerlessness.
- Erica Jung.
- Erica long.
Hey pups!
Hey!
Hi Gloria! Hi Betty!
Hi!
Whoa, you're so skinny.
Come on,
let's gel you something to eat.
No, no.
They're not skinny,
they're lean.
Dogs are too dependent
on humans.
I'm not their slave.
They can gel their own damn food.
- From where?
- Outside. Gophers, squirrels...
- ..-neighbor's cat.
- An unattended baby?
They're carnivores.
They're meant to be hunters.
Here,
hand me that chain break.
Mom, you look...
bigger.
These?
Fake.
Fake?
You mean you had a boob job?
No, I had a mastectomy.
These are prosthetic.
I was wondering, you know,
women who have really big breasts,
I'd like to see what that's like...
...and I'll tell you,
they get so in the way, it's unbelievable.
I'm thinking
of trading them in for a mid-size.
When?
When did you have a mastectomy?
I don't know.
Five weeks ago or so.
Who keeps track?
They found a lump.
It was aggressive.
Hadn't spread yet.
I'm aggressive too, so I said "what the hell,
why push my luck?
Take them both."
Why didn't you tell me?
I am telling you.
Now.
Well I would have driven you
to the hospital.
Portia...
I cabbed it.
I'm OK.
You know,
I'm thinking you should...
.-.start calling me Susannah.
I think
this could help us avoid...
...all this mother-daughter role playing crap
that you can't seem to shake.
You're welcome to stay...
but there's not much for supper
unless you want to go pick some kale.
I'm remodeling
your old room.
That's good.
I'm going to make a tea kettle.
Come on, do it!
Oh baby.
- Portia Nathan.
- John Pressman.
Hi.
Look, I wanted to see if you wanted to maybe
get a drink or a bite to eat or something?
Maybe talk about the application process,
since we're new to it?
- I can swing by and pick you up.
- I guess I could eat.
The parents all think
that their kids' acceptance...
is the final referendum
on their parenting skills...
...which, hello,
it's not about you.
As far as I can tell,
parents exist just to drive their kids insane.
Of course,
what the hell do I know, really?
Why, were you raised
by wolves?
Wolf.
Singular.
- One wolf.
- One wolf.
And you never wanted kids?
I love that question.
It seemed unfair to subject anyone
to the miserable experience I had.
Why would you?
There's no way in hell I would raise
Nelson the way I was raised.
Why not?
Because I was raised by sheep.
So... Uganda.
I was working there
and Nelson's morn was a friend.
And she died in a car crash.
Along with his uncle.
Nelson was two.
So you adopted him.
Seemed like the only thing to do.
All my friends
thought for sure that I'd bail.
That I was not ready
to be a father, but...
- ...screw that.
- Right. Screw that.
Nelson loves traveling.
He loves it.
We've lived in Indonesia.
We built a water
purification system in Myanmar.
I'm sorry,
so you're just this single dad...
...traveling the world with his kid,
doing good?
Well, when you put it like that
it just sounds so appealing.
But I have that on a t-shirt,
actually.
'Single dad,
traveling the world with his kid, doing good"
You can borrow it
some day if you like.
I'm not sure
people would believe it on me.
Anyway,
it's the best thing I ever did...
...adopting a kid.
It's getting late.
Excuse me?
Oh no, I can't do that, actually.
I can't accept gifts.
Excuse me?
Princeton wants to buy me
a chicken sandwich.
Thank you so much.
Portia,
there's something I want to ask you...
...and I know
this is all a bit abrupt.
Yes?
Do you think you have room
for one more in your life?
One more what?
One more person.
Oh John,
that's so sweet.
But you seem
like a great guy too.
And you can handle an axe...
...and you know,
you have a very nice nose and your...
...face,
but I have a long-term boyfriend.
Long, long,
long-term.
And you know, we are happy.
We're very happy.
We're so...
haPPY-
Wow, happy is one of those words
that if you say it...
...a lot, it loses its meaning.
Like "fork."
Fork. Fork.
Fork. Fork.
Happv- Happy-
Happy- Hapw
Happy. Fork.
It's not...Portia, what I mean-
No, goodbye. Thank you.
This was so much better than kale.
OK.
I'm sorry.
I was going for the cheek.
Yeah!
That's OK.
OK, well,
nice catching up...
...and best of luck
with the application process.
Here is my card.
I have your card.
- I gave you my card?
- Yeah.
That's great.
Then you have my card-
Oh my god.
Sorry, it was there, you know?
You just...
What are you going to do?
- Look, the reason that I'm -
- You look!
I am an admissions officer
and you run a school and I live with someone.“...
...and I've had a really long day...
and I'm exhausted
and this never happened, do you understand?
Portia, no.
Portia, look,
I asked you here for a reason.
And it wasn't to kiss you.
Please communicate
with my associate Ben in the future.
Portia, wait!
Wait, it's just...
I think.-.
I think
maybe Jeremiah's your son.
What?
Jeremiah.
I think maybe he's your son.
Are you
out of your fucking mind?
All right.
Let me rewind.
At Dartmouth,
I was friends with Shelley-
I don't know what you're talking about
and you need to leave.
- Now.
- Portia, wait-
- Jesus!
- She said leave her alone!
What the hell! Morn,
put the gun down!
No means no, asshole.
I have got this under control.
Go inside!
You don't have shit under control.
You never have.
Screw you, mom.
I do so have my life under control!
You could have been somebody,
goddamn it!
You could have been
a trailblazer!
Right, like you?
Holed up here
like some crazy old witch?
You know what?
I'm just going to get into my car, very slowly...
...and let you two chat.
- Portia, I'll call you.
- Please don't-.
Well you're not very good
at returning e-mails.
- You all right?
- Fine.
Watch where you're waving
that thing.
Your breasts are sliding off.
Hi everyone.
Just back from a boring recruitment trip.
Uneventful.
There she is.
So, have you found the finest young minds
in the nation for us?
I'm trying!
Course she has,
she's our golden retriever.
I love this.
I love this bean salad.
It's just so beans
and vinaigrette.
- So simple, but it just works.
- Yeah, beans.
Oh, hello Helen.
So glad you could make it after all-.
And I can guarantee personally
that next year all your Virginia Woolf seminars...
will be filled with superhumans.
I'll never really understand
your admissions system in America.
Because we just do tests.
You know, we don't really care
about your childhood...
...or your recent conversion
to Buddhism.
Gray matter,
that's what counts.
Helen, would you mind putting
the bread on the table?
Thank you so much.
I just...
I want you to know that this...
...us, this life,
it's everything I've always wanted.
Helen, back so soon.
Could you put the salad on?
What's she got against bean salad?
Portia, we need to talk.
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.
Oh god,
I hate these lunches too.
No, this.
Us.
Is that Helen?
That's weird.
Portia, I'm having twins.
- What are you talking about?
- Twins.
Twins, I'm having twins.
You're talking like a crazy person.
Helen is having twins. My twins.
I'm leaving you.
I'm sorry,
you had sex with that woman?
A bit.
You had unprotected sex
with that vile Virginia Woolf scholar?
There's no need to make a scene.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this, you don't.
You're loyal
and a good companion...
- Slop it with the dog stuff!
- What?
I have to go.
Now.
No, you have to slay.
We have guests.
And, we are a family..-unit.
You didn't want a family.
- Neither did you!
- No, that's true. I really don't.
I can't stand babies.
They're repulsive.
Oh god,
she's backing out now.
That's the chicken.
Would you mind, terribly,
taking it out? Goodbye.
I kissed someone!
Almost on purpose!
Mark had an emergency.
A student was...
...having a breakdown
about Robert Frost.
Two roads diverging in a wood
and which to lake.
So, who likes breasts?
Mark loves breasts.
The more the merrier.
In fact, why don't I just put
this aside for him for when he gets home?
So who likes legs?
Well, Mark likes legs.
Who likes assholes?
I guess that's me.
Virginia Woolf was a twat.
Extremely overrated.
No Gertrude Stein.
I'll have a breast, please.
Oh god.
God dammit.
Dammit!
Excuse me.
This is your mother?
Yes.
I saw her lecture
on Frida Kahlo in 1977.
She was extremely hot.
OK.
Is she well?
Your mother?
Yeah, she's fine.
Good. Well, thank you for the party.
It was very pleasant.
Everyone is now leaving, OK.
- I shall close this door behind?
- Yes. I'll be right out.
Get to work.
I will always be there for you.
Nothing will ever change that.
Top of the morning, Clarence.
Morning.
If you want to take
a couple personal days...
Why would I?
Everyone knows?
- About Mark, I mean.
- Yes.
And that Woolf woman.
I'm very sorry
about the timing of this...
...bul I want you to know
that I am here for you one thousand percent.
This is my life.
It's what I'm good at.
I know.
And please, rest assured,
that nothing...
...will affect my work.
Nothing.
Well that's great.
You just carry on.
And that
was the famous Blair Arch.
Here comes one of our illustrious
Admissions officers.
Clearly a very busy time
for you all.
Any words of wisdom
for hopefully future Princelonians?
- What?
- Words of wisdom?
Just...
gel those applications in and...
...remember to be yourself,
because...
...who else could you be?
That's...
.-.that's who you're stuck with.
OK. You got the idea.
Let's keep moving!
Any budding astrophysicists
in the crowd?
Because I've got a treat
for you next!
Jeremiah, from Quest.
Hi.
- You remember me?
- Yes. I remember you.
I'm Nelson.
I remember you loo.
I'm John.
Turns out we had a chance to come down
here today, visit the campus.
What a surprise.
It's awesome.
It's like, ancient.
I'm sorry, but what do you think
that you're doing here?
Jeremiah wanted to see the place.
And you and I should talk.
You are out of your mind.
I almost forgot to ask...
Remember when you said
I could spend the night with an undergrad?
Is that still possible?
OK. Yes.
That's possible.
Just catch up with the tour
and meet me back at Admissions.
What are you doing?
You're not allowed in here!
What happened the other night.
Nothing happened the other night.
Right.
It was nothing.
So don't let it get in the way of this.
This is Jeremiah's
birth certificate.
I knew Shelley.
Your roommate at Dartmouth.
I had a car.
She borrowed it to pick you up
after you had the baby.
Valentine's Day.
Shelley told me you had the baby
at 1pm on Valentine's Day.
That stuck with me.
I hate Valentine's Day-.
- It's a despicable holiday.
- It sucks.
Here's the crazy part.
When Jeremiah applied to Quest,
I saw this and put it together.
It says that he was born
and given up for adoption on Valentine's Day...
1995, 1pm at Blaine Hospital.
I know you didn't ask for this.
And I'm not trying to ruin your life.
But I care about this kid...
and I think he could use a
little more connection in his life.
But I didn't tell him anything.
It's your decision-.
I'm
just setting it up.
He has his parents.
He has you, right? Nelson?
Yeah, his parents are great people.
But we're moving on...
.-.Nelson and me.
Hey, maybe it was meant to be.
Nothing is meant to be.
And you don't just barrel into
other people's lives like this.
This is bad form.
- This is bad form.
- Bad form.
I am not a project.
I am not some village in need
of a water system.
- Hi.
- Hi.
John Pressman.
Quest School.
Clarence Hall, Dean of Admissions.
Princeton.
- It's quite an operation you have here.
- Thank you.
OK.
Well, Mr. Pressman was just leaving.
Right. Of course.
It was nice to meet you.
Hey, I heard about you guys
dropping to number two.
Sorry.
But number two is,
you know, that's good..-too-.
Here's the information
you wanted for your student...
the undergrad
he'll be spending the night with.
Thank you.
And here is the information
you'll need on that student.
Ben, do you mind escorting
Mr. Pressman out?
And Mr. Pressman,
in the future...
e-mail is the appropriate form
of communication.
Right. Sorry.
Yeah. E-mail.
Will do.
All right, see you.
You know,
it's highly unusual...
...it's actually unheard of,
for a school director lo be back here.
I know.
I think we should hire a security guard
to keep the crazies out because...
...it is getting out of control.

Yo, whassup?
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm looking for my roomie.
- Can I help you?
- You're doing a great job.
So a zombie will move and talk
as if it were awake and genuinely aware...
...of its surroundings,
but its inner light is off.
Right.
And if it is logically possible for a creature
to have a brain just like yours...
...and no conscious experience,
then consciousness
is not literally identical to brain activity.
Exactly!
Exactly!
Hi.
You are not a student.
- What, you're trying to crash or something here?
- Yo, whassup?
L...Hi!
Hi everyone, I'm from Admissions
and we like to come in and..-...
...check on our overnight
high school visitors.
So Jeremiah,
are you warm enough?
Do you have everything
that you need?
Do you need
a Princeton sweatshirt...
or did you remember
to bring your toothbrush?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Good.
What is that?
- This is diet soda?
- Diet soda? Why diet?
- I just like the taste better.
- So do I. That is...unbelievable.
I guess.
Just diet soda?
No...
Yeah. It's just...
Great. Good. Well...
...gel back to your zombie talk.
OK.
Thank you.
Dude, what a cougar.
Shit.
Hi.
You don't happen to actually have
an extra toothbrush on you, do you?
On me? No. No. Why?
You do need a toothbrush?
- Yeah.
- OK.
Soft bristles, right?
That's what kids
- teenagers - your age...
...are supposed to use, right?
I think soft might be
more for baby teeth.
I prefer to
use just a medium.
Yup, don't listen to me.
You'd end up
with a mouthful of cavities.
Hey, how about this rechargeable
toothbrush?
That looks pretty cool.
Yeah, I don't think I need that...
as much as I do appreciate
Thomas the Tank Engine.
I'm an idiot.
You just pick what you need.
Just...
Ok then.
OK...
- Well I guess this is it.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.
Portia?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm great.
What are you doing here?
Well, we're just up the street.
She said she's fine.
Have you been drinking, Portia?
A little bit.
You know me, I'm a lightweight.
Where are your glasses?
I thought I'd give contacts a try.
Well, all right.
Good to see you.
Oh no.
That's harsh.
Yes.
Yes it is.
- Portia Nathan here.
- Susannah here.
Your mother. Mom.
Mark called.
I know he never liked me...
but he thought you might be in need
of some comfort and guidance.
So, I think this is all a very good thing.
Getting left is a good thing?
Really? I have to go.
Good, you're angry.
You need to express that.
Talk to me.
I'm here for you.
Sweetie.
Well, I actually feel really sad and-
And that is exactly why I knew that night
on the train thirty seven years ago...
...-the man reading
"I'm OK, You're OK".-.
No, please,
not the train story.
I knew I needed his sperm
but I did not need him.
Hey!
Watch yourself, asshole!
Mom. Susannah...
I wanted a child
but not some moody relationship.
Sex with a stranger on the New Jersey Transit
was the answer to my problems.
It's not healthy
to need other people too much.
Now you need to go out
and fall in love with yourself.
- Well I'm going to go do that.
- You go, girl.
Yup.
Going to go buy a train ticket right now.
Please Do Not Disturb
John, it's Portia again.
This is my eighth...
no ninth message.
Please call me back.
It is very important
that you not tell Jeremiah a thing about...
...the thing.
The thing that we were talking about.
Not a word.
Call me back.
Maybe I got a glass eye, but it some from working
in a factory at the age of eleven.
They hooked it out
because they didn't have a shield on the works...
...bul I wear it like a medal
because it tells the world where I belong,
deep down in the working class.
Yeah!
Hey Princeton,
what are you doing?
Just observing the school
so I can better evaluate applicants.
Cool.
I'm cutting class.
Cutting class
is never a good idea.
I hate geography class.
I hate maps.
You hate maps?
Why?
Because you never know
where you'll end up on them.
Not with my dad.
Well, I'm sure your dad has excellent reasons
for living a rootless and impulsive life.
I thought you loved traveling.
I'm sick of traveling.
I love playing Bridge.
Besides, do they even play
Bridge in Ecuador?
No idea.
- How long have you been at Princeton?
- Sixteen years, but-
Wow.
You totally rock.
- Yeah, thanks. Why is that?
- Because you're totally predictable.
So, can you tell me
where I can find your dad?
I've been trying to reach you.
I left you a million messages.
Yeah, well sorry,
I'm a little busy.
What are you doing
to that cow?
The cow's in labor.
I'd shake your hand, but...
- Look, I never told a soul-
- Stay back!
This cow doesn't know you.
Actually, I think we met
the last time I was here.
Do you even know whether Jeremiah
wants to meet his birth mother'?
He wrote an essay
last year entitled...
"Nature versus Nurture:
I wonder who my birth parents are"
Portia the Wise!
Nelson told me you were here.
I just wanted to thank you so much!
I had the best night of my life.
There is nothing I want more in life
than to go to Princeton.
Nothing.
Is something wrong
with that cow?
Where's the goddamn vet!
Well, I'm going to find
my own way out.
Shit!
This isn't right.
This isn't how it looks
on the internet!
- OK, bye now. Best of luck with all that.
- Come back!
Grab her head.
Calm her down.
No, you said stay back.
I changed my mind!
- She looks so mad.
- Well she's probably protecting her young.
Hey there, little mama.
It's all going to be OK. Just...
...just focus on your breath.
Your terrible, terrible breath.
Think how lucky you are
not to be on a beef ranch right now.
I'm sorry,
that was inappropriate.
Where is the bull
that did this to you?
He's probably out partying
with his friends.
She's clamping again!
Jeremiah, get back here!
Please! Fast!
You are not alone.
You are not alone, OK mama?
We're here with you.
You can do this.
Because it happens either way.
It happens either way.
All right, it's coming!
Portia, gel back here, now!
Horrible.
Grab a hoof, grab a hoof.
All right, I'm going to count to three. One...
...two, three, pull!
It's gross!
Boundaries!
Did you not see
my "Do Not Disturb" Sign?
Yeah, I saw it.
But you're not the only one
who reeks of cow placenta.
Why do you have
"Do Not Disturb" signs with you?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe for times like these.
Here, try this soap.
Look, he's a great kid...
...and you're clearly a great,
mildly compulsive woman.
Take the leap!
I'm sorry,
who's mildly compulsive?
Why do you run around
fixing everyone else's life?
What about yours?
My life is fine, thank you very much.
It's frigging great.
Oh god,
the water just turned to ice!
Whoops, sorry.
Yeah, it's solar powered.
Bit finicky.
Jeremiah has to get
his application in, pronto.
Work on his resume.
A unique talent that demonstrates passion
and commitment would be good.
He has got to get
going on his essay.
And you have to prepare him
for an alumni interview.
You may have built schools
in third world countries...
and cleaned contaminated water
from villages...
...but you have never tried
to get a kid into Princeton.
- Neither have you.
- I am not trying!
I am an Admissions Officer.
I'm just helping you try.
As I would with any outstanding student
who may have been overlooked.
There's nothing improper
going on here.
I am going to exit
the shower stall now.
OK.
Well I'm going to remain in the shower stall
for approximately thirty seconds.
Fantastic.
HEY-
Yes?
How can I help you?
Do you think he has a shot?
Send me his transcripts.
Nelson, take a corner kick.
Nelson, take a corner kick.
What was that?
Do it again.
I'm not good at corner kicks.
Horseshit.
Put your heart into it-.
Hey, Portia-
How you doing?
This is, without a doubt,
the worst transcript I have ever seen.
Switch.
Ds and Fs in ninth,
tenth and eleventh grade?
Suspensions, detentions,
a Special Ed class?
What the hell
were you thinking?
Did you read the rest of it?
Why?
Am I missing a police record?
Come on, man!
Quit half-assing it!
Play like that, those Ecuadorian kids
are going to eat you up.
An right.
Jeremiah got the top score on eight
Advanced Placement tests...
...without ever taking
the Advanced Placement courses?
And his SATs
are almost perfect.
- God, did he...
- Cheat? No.
I insisted
he take those tests.
He's the most brilliant
student I've come across.
- Really?
- Switch!
Regardless, kids like Jeremiah
don't get into Princeton.
He's going to be up against kids
that have resumes fifteen feet long.
So?
Those kids are so burnt out already
all they want to do is get stoned...
and play frisbee
for the rest of their lives.
Princeton would be damn
lucky to have Jeremiah.
Hey, "Fulbol."
"Futbol"
- it's the world's sport, all right?
Put some
heart into it!
Did you get
that other thing I sent you?
- In the box?
- What?
World's Greatest Mom
- Very funny.
- Look, he wants this.
He really wants this.
And I think he would thrive there.
I can see it.
Look, I can't do anything
that could get me into trouble.
But since you're new to the process,
as a professional courtesy, I can...
...send you books, resources,
everything that one might need. OK?
- Great.
- Goodbye.
What the hell was that?
I put my heart into it-
"Futbol."
I'll give you ten bucks
if you can do it again.
They grow up so damn fast,
don't they?
Yeah.
Which one is yours?
Yeah.
How to Talk

Right?
Exactly.
College Bound and Gagged

OK, OK, I heard you.
Let me.
It lakes a village.
Get your hands off my baby!
- No, I'm just helping.
- What are you doing?
Everybody needs a little help.
- What the hell.
- I'm helping you.
Come on, come on.
Right now!
I'm not a creep.
Balakian, Jeremiah
When I was eight years old...
I realized my teachers
were not going to be able to teach me.
So I became an autodidact.
I read everything.
I read biographies...
mainly because I didn't know how
other people lived their lives.
I learned several years ago
that I was adopted.
That I was supposed to be the son
that my parents tried so hard to have on their own.
I think my voracious reading came from a deep
longing for something that was missing.
I was searching for someone.
For my story.
To not feel so alone.
Portia?
I knew you were taking
this all rather hard...
but I thought by now
you'd be back on your feet.
What?
It kills me.
It really kills me.
You'll get through this.
- You think-
- I know it seems impossible, but you will.
- No, this has nothing to do with-
- It's OK, it's OK. I understand.
No really.
Christ, I have to go.
Hang on in there.
That's so funny.
Il Forno is one of my favorite
restaurants loo.
- That's amazing.
- I know.
Portia, sweetie.
You feeling all right?
Just terrific, thanks.
Oh good.
Then I think there was an evaluation card
that was placed on the wrong file.
Jeremiah Balakian.
- Balakian.
- Ba...?
Balakian.
- Balakian.
- Balakian.
I think-.
You didn't mean to put
"High Consider," did you?
Let me see-.
No, that's right.
But he has Ds
and Fs and suspensions.
But did you notice that he also got 5s
on all eight AP exams...
.-.without ever taking
any AP courses?
Yes. I'm going to investigate that.
That's impossible.
No, apparently not.
If the child in question is a unique,
special child.
This isn't a child,
it's an applicant.
He's got
no extracurriculars at all.
The counselor at his old high school
said he was shocked...
Jeremiah
was even applying to college.
He's an autodidact.
He's an advanced reader
from the age of eight.
Leonardo DaVinci was an autodidact.
So was Benjamin Franklin-.
Did this Balakian kid
discover electricity or paint the Mona Lisa?
I must have missed that in his file.
He's a great kid.
Portia, dear.
Take a deep breath.
Teamwork, remember?
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.
I forgot
you're in a very fragile stale.
Maybe you'd like to step outside
and see how fragile I am.
Only kidding!
Only kidding.
Just a little levity
to enhance the teamwork.
Thank you for your thoughts,
Corrine.
He is never getting in.
Never.
Calm down.
There's something great
I want to show you.
- It turns out Jeremiah was a stale champion-
- In what?
You know what?
It's better if you see it for yourself.
He's going to be doing it
at Nelson's birthday party.
Shows originality, intellectual passion,
everything the books talk about.
Slate champion.
Thank god.
Excellent.
So Hi send you the address
to Nelson's birthday party.
It's at my parents' house.
- I'll be there.
- Good.
Is she coming to my party?
Why do you like her so much?
I don't know.
She's weird.
- She is indeed.
- Doesn't matter anyway, right?
Sure it matters.
But, about this Spanish test.
This is your third
"try harder" in a row.
Senora Garcia says
you have an aptitude for languages-
What if I don't?
What if I don't have an aptitude
for languages?
What if I'm not a genius
like Jeremiah?
I don't want you to be a genius.
I'm not a genius.
But I want you to be able
to get by in the world.
- Whatever.
- En espanol.
Whatever. I have class.
Even Becket emerged
from Goebbels' overcoat.
Not to mention Pinter, Janet.
- Professor Polokov.
- Yes?
- Portia Nathan.
- Yes, the sad lady.
The sad lady?
That's not really how I think of myself.
How is your mother?
She's fine.
So I wonder, would you consider conducting
some supplementary admissions interviews?
A scholar of your stature would carry
a huge amount of weight with the committee.
In fact, there's one
extremely unusual applicant...
...who's shown a strong interest
in literature and philosophy-
Why would I want to speak
with a high school student?
Of course, perhaps we could make
some sort of arrangement...
I can't believe you're pimping me.
I'm not "pimping" you.
He's a fan of your writing.
And I need him
to meet this applicant.
Besides, when was the last time
you went to a party?
With racist jockey statues?
Never.
Yeah, those are pretty weird.
Hey Portia,
thanks for coming to my party.
Hey Nelson, happy birthday!
Glad you could make it.
So this is your parents' place?
Yeah, well,
my mom's now.
My dad passed away
a few months ago.
I'm sorry.
It's nice to see you again.
You're not packing heat
by any chance, are you?
Should I be?
No, no, we're all friendlies.
So, what is this?
That is a fossil
from the Jurassic era.
It has been in the same place
for a hundred and fifty million years.
Cool!
Welcome, welcome, welcome!
- Mom, I would like you to-
- I'm Johnny's mother, Mrs. Pressman.
Are you Johnny's girlfriend?
No.
We are friends.
Just friendly acquaintances.
Portia Nathan.
Of course.
What am I thinking?
He can't love anything...
...that's less than
a ten hour ﬂight from JFK.
Maybe we don't have to go,
right Grandma?
- Nelson...
- You're absolutely right, Nelson.
There's nothing wrong
with staying in the same place for a while.
Ask Portia.
She's been in the same job
for sixteen years!
Yeah,
and it's a travesty, Nelson.
Portia was president
of her high school class.
Mom-
She resigned in protest
over funding for the girls' sports program.
She led a school-wide walk out.
And the relevance of all this is?
When you were nine months old,
you could walk.
She actually walked.
I don't mean just stumble walking
like an infant or a toddler...
...she waked with absolute certainty.
One day I saw her
tumble over her shoelaces.
She did not cry.
She didn't fall down.
She sat down, carefully,
and tied her shoelaces in a double knot...
.-.got up and kept going-
At nine months old.
There are a lot
of holes in that story.
You were fearless.
You were born an Amazon.
That's amazing.
I love it.
And what makes you think
she needs your approval?
- I don't.
- OK, that's enough crazytown.
When Johnny
got admitted to Harvard Law...
Oh god.
...he decided to go
and live in Outer Mongolia instead.
Yeah.
Outer Mongolia.
You know what, Portia, I'm with you.
Enough crazytown.
Have another vat of gin, Mom.
- Ms. Nathan.
- Yes?
Vladimir Polokov.
You are just as beautiful today
as you were thirty years ago.
I just had a mastectomy.
I was just translated into Finnish.
Brilliant.
Can I gel you some iced lea?
Or something stronger perhaps?
Why not.
I'll stroll with you-.
I would love to.
It would be a pleasure.
It was a pleasure.
Your lawn jockeys are just...outstanding.
Yeah, aren't they fun?
And now, with a special performance
for Nelson on his big day.
Performing the act
that won him honorable mention...
at the New Hampshire Slate
Championships.
Put your hands together...
Put your hands together!
For Jeremiah Balakian!
I want to dedicate
this performance to Nelson.
Happy birthday, pal.
Honorable mention,
I thought you said he won.
He was robbed.
This is my other friend...
...Rene Descartes.
- Say "Hello, Rene."
- Hello, Rene.
How are you, Rene?
I think, therefore I am.
Did you say you're pink,
therefore you're ham?
Do you have any advice
for a young man, Rene?
Whatever you do...
...don't put the horse before...
"Descartes.
Do you guys want to see Descartes
philosophize backwards?
I think, therefore I am.
Oh god.
That's terrible.
What was that?
Come on,
that showed originality, depth-
Are you kidding me?
Here from the island of misfit toys
is Jeremiah Balakian.
Are those birds?
Those are doves.
For the party?
No, you know,
my morn has a dove room.
By the way,
I know that wasn't a perfect showcase...
but he can't pretend
to be somebody he's not.
Yes he can.
You should try it sometime.
It's how humans behave here
on planet earth.
I know how humans
behave on planet earth...
because I've actually lived
a few places on planet earth-.
Wait!
Here, help me out.
Aren't you ready yet?
- I'm lighting them as fast as I can.
- Hurry up!
Do you like the cake?
It's very patriotic.
Nelson's idea.
How many frigging candles
are on this cake?
Fifty.
It was my mom's idea.
Polokov was looking
at Jeremiah like he had two heads.
Well that's his problem, isn't it!
Look, I want Jeremiah to go to Princeton
because he wants to go to Princeton...
and I actually think
he'd do great there...
.-.but if he doesn't get in to Princeton,
if he gets in to another school-..
Well that's fine loo.
Because where you went to school...
and what your background is,
that's just a box and I reject it.
I reject being put into a box.
OK?
- Hi.
- Hi, morn.
- How'd it go?
- It was good.
Mr. and Mrs. Balakian,
I'm Portia Nathan.
I want to say thank you so much for everything that
you have done for this boy.
You're wonderful people.
She's from Princeton.
Well, you're welcome.
I love you.
OK.
Bye.
Portia?
What are you doing here?
I want to come live with you!
Why in god's name
would you want to live with me?
Because you're a normal,
boring adult.
I bet you'd take me
to Chuck E. Cheese.
What makes you think
I'm so boring?
You just are.
It's good.
At your age,
you're supposed to be boring.
I'm the same age
as your dad!
Tell him that!
- Hello?
- John, it's Portia. I have Nelson.
- You do?
- He's fine.
- He is?
- Yes. He's fine.
Thank goodness.
Nelson, you know how much
I love this statue, right?
Yeah.
You rode a horse three days
through Outer Mongolia in the pouring rain...
...living off
mare's milk to bring it back.
That's right.
And I've dragged it place to place,
across the world ever since I was twenty two.
That is nothing compared
to how much I love you.
Please don't scare me
like that again.
Why?
You do it all the time?
Hide out in cars?
Run away!
I'll never run away from you.
And going across the world
and helping people is not running away.
I know, but why
can't we ever just do what I want?
Because you are a kid.
I am an adult.
What I say in this house goes!
This parenthood thing...
...well, it's a disaster.
So I hear.
I'm screwing it up.
Am I? Screwing it up?
You're asking me?
I don't know, it's just,
Nelson and I have always travelled.
I wanted to give him the kind of life
I didn't have as a kid.
I wanted to give him
the opposite of what I had as a kid...
but now all of a sudden
he's turning into my mother.
You know, he plays Bridge.
He listens to Lite FM.
He asked for a blue blazer with gold buttons
and anchors on them for Christmas.
Does your mom
wear blue blazers?
No, that was my father.
How is it possible?
What am I doing wrong?
At least you're trying.
I mean, there's so many
different kinds of parents.
There's no one best way to do it.
Or so I have gathered...
with my vast experience
reading personal essays.
Speaking of which, I have
fifteen essays to get through tonight, so...
Well thank you
for bringing him back.
Of course.
So you really are leaving,
aren't you?
In a month and a half.
- I thought-
- Let's just not think for a while.
Great.
Hey Portia.
Are you going to be my mom?
What? No.
Just messing with you.
Right. Go back to sleep.
Guess you're not so boring after all-.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
Did you stay over?
Too long
of a drive back to campus?
I slept on the sofa.
So did your mother.
We did not make it
all the way to the bedroom.
I didn't need to know that.
Interesting.
Unique, I would say.
Really, that's enough information.
The boy. Jeremiah.
The ventriloquism...
Weird- I liked it.
- I will write a recommendation.
- Thank you!
Thank you, sad lady.
Mom?
Mom?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to tell you something.
I know.
You slept with that guy,
didn't you?
I did.
Then we both got lucky.
Yeah.
He's leaving.
It's OK. It's good.
It is good.
You don't need
any commitments right now.
It's perfect.
No.
Honey, I'm exhausted.
That old Russian guy
gave me a workout.
Just take a nap.
Just for a bit.
Actually,
I've got to hit the road.
Next victim!
Good luck with the fencing finals,
Sebastian.
It was a pleasure to meet you.
Thank you so much.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
This is Jeremiah Balakian.
Good to meet you.
Are you Mr. Balakian?
No.
His parents couldn't make it.
I'm his teacher.
Yeah,
you look like a teacher.
Might want to tuck that in, son.
So, Jeremiah, why don't you come
into my torture chamber...
...we'll have a chat and you can tell me
why you want to go to Princeton.
I rode crew.
Class of eighty-one.
Lot's changed since then.
Hey.
This kid, he's terrific.
Yeah. Great.
No, I mean he's authentic.
He doesn't want to just go to Princeton
to meet future business partners.
He loves learning
for the sake of learning.
That's what it's about,
isn't it?
Right.
Why don't you go get yourself
a cup of coffee.
Yeah, great.
Thanks.
- Prick.
- Excuse me?
I just called you a prick.
I'm sorry.
Don't take it out on him.
It's my own thing.
That's not very nice.
I know.
So, Jeremiah,
tell me about yourself-.
Myself as in, you know,
in relation to my soul or...
...do you mean myself as like a unified person
as the source of consciousness?
Or do you mean myself
like a narrative center of gravity?
How bad was it?
I'm not supposed to discuss
alumni recommendations.
It was that bad?
Can we get him
a second alumni interview?
I'm afraid not.
Tomorrow,
the committee meetings begin...
...and...look, I've got to go home
and get some sleep.
It's the last chance
I'm going to have for three weeks.
Your meetings
last three weeks?
- I have to go.
- Right.
Bye.
I have spoken
to the Judo Association and...
...they have no record
of his "national championship.'
DENY
Thank you. Goodbye.
I just want to say thank you.
I've tried to put
on a brave front about M-M-
I can't even say his name.
- Mark.
- Yes. Him.
And honestly...
...you're the only person
who has really been so sensitive...
...to what I'm going through
and I appreciate it so much.
Men can be such pigs.
People are all pigs.
OK, yes.
I'm with you on that.
Oh no-
Maybe we can declare
a truce, because...
...we women have to stick together
in this man eat woman...
...dog eat bitch world.
Sisterhood.
You are so right.
- Good.
- Yeah.
Friends, today...
...we begin
the process of choosing...
...the most remarkable freshman class
in Princeton history.
Here is the order of territories,
chosen randomly.
We begin with the West.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Corrine, are you ready?
Yes.
Yulia Karasov.
Class rank two of four hundred and fifty,
magnet school in a suburb of San Diego.
Her family emigrated
from Russia ten years ago.
She's captain of the cross-country team,
sports editor of the school paper.
Math 760,
Critical Reading 710, Writing 740.
But the recs aren't special.
They admire her,
but they don't love her.
Show of hands for acceptance.
DENY
Holy shit,
that's the kid that doesn't get in?
Sylvia Hadlock.
Applying from Los Angeles...
but she's originally
from our beautiful stale of New Jersey.
DENY
Wallace Thompson.
Twenty-one hundred combined SAT...
...class treasurer...
Volunteers for Santa Claus...chess champion...
prison web site... started an organic farm...
"electromagnetic waves on bees.
Alice Copley.
Her dream is to be a prosecutor,
then serve on the Supreme Court.
Alice's mother was murdered.
The murderer got off on a technicality.
Alice would like to retry him...
...and put him away for life.
Though she would prefer
the death penalty.
Excellent extracurriculars.
Twenty-two twenty
combined SAT. 4.2 GPA
I'm a little concerned about a revenge
fantasy fueling her academics.
Portia, you were second reader.
I see you put "Maybe"
I might have
underestimated her passion...
...upon first reading,
as we all sometimes do.
I think this girl's
self-knowledge is impressive.
She's an excellent candidate.
Vote.
Very good.
ACCEPT
Dashiel Weld Broward.
Fourth generation legacy.
Four point oh.
Captain of his sailing club.
He led them to victory
three years in a row.
SATs?
660, 710, 600-.
He's just one of those kids
that doesn't test well.
But, oh,
can he read the wind.
So what you're saying
is that an unusual candidate's strengths...
...in some areas
really do outweigh major...
...and I mean
major - weakness elsewhere.
Yes.
Well let's vote then.
For acceptance?
Aput Kunayak
from Nome, Alaska.
Managed
to take five AP classes...
...while working
on his father's reindeer farm and...
.-.starting and running a shelter
for homeless sled dogs-.
Had suffered
from ADD but overcame it...
...to become a leader
in his high school.
He'd be the first
in his family to attend college.
Now Ben, as you know, we have room
for very few of these "iffy" students.
But then again, we have to make room
for the exceptional, right?
Let's vote.
Aput Kunayak.
Are you going
to give me the file?
And last,
we come to the end.
The Northeast.
Portia, please begin.
Thank you.
Richard Guinness.
Rye Country Day School.
State champion in the one hundred
and thirty eight pound wrestling class.
Played "Rolfe" in the school production
of "The Sound of Music.'
DENY
Chess club,
makes an excellent soufﬂé...
...member of the team
but not a leader.
Backbone
of the Woodwinds section...
...was the highest praise he got.
He is the kind of student
you could always call upon...
...-to help with
Martin Luthor King Day activities-.
Who isn't?
That's twenty eight
denies in a row.
Come on, Portia.
Make us fall in love.
OK. Let's see.
Jeremiah Balakian.
Jeremiah is our first applicant
from Quest...
...a new school
in New Hampshire.
Developmental,
but academically rigorous.
Jeremiah is an only child.
Parents both work
at a Stop N Go.
Neither
of them attended college.
The first three years
of his high school life were...
...a disaster.
If you're wondering
why you are even listening to this...
Jeremiah is also a self-described
autodidact since the age of eight.
He's very well read.
In fact, he's the most well read
person I have met.
Ever.
And why?
For his resume?
To impress someone?
For the sake of learning.
His passion for knowledge.
He had no plans to attend college
until this past fall...
...when he switched to Quest...
...and came into contact with teachers
who recognized his potential.
Last spring,
he took the SATs and eight AP tests.
Wail, so he took AP classes?
No AP classes.
No SAT prep courses.
But he got 5's on all eight APs.
And 790, 780
and 790 on the SATs.
- That's amazing.
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- That's amazing.
- Amazing.
It's amazing.
Exactly.
Do you think he can handle
an intense academic community?
Thank you.
- That's a great question, thank you.
- You're welcome.
The director
of his new school says...
...he is idiosyncratic,
cerebral...
.-.a true original whose abilities
would lift the level of discourse.“...
...in any class he enrolled in.
You seem...
passionate about him.
I am.
So what was his GPA?
I mean, before Quest?
D plus.
One point five.
He was a lost kid.
And then he was found.
So Corrine, you were second reader.
I see you wrote "Deny."
Any second thoughts?
Well, he is like no other applicant
we have ever considered.
His alumni interview
was not so great.
That guy sounded like a jerk.
And he has a positive
recommendation...
...from no less of a scholar
than Vladimir Polokov.
OK, maybe from our perspective
he could have done more...
...made himself more of a resume
and paper trail.
But he look himself
from nowhere to where he is today.
He educated himself
purely by instinct.
Not because he wants
to put away his mother's killer.
He was as isolated
as someone in Nome, Alaska.
He was alone.
He was completely alone.
And you know,
maybe if his parents had been rich...
he would have been exposed
to more.
We have to make room
for these kids.
We have to make room
for kids like these.
Clarence, you told us
at the beginning of the year...
to find that undiscovered gem.
I found him.
Well, let's vote.
All in favor of admission?
He also received an honorable mention
at the state finals for ventriloquism.
We're in the middle of a vole.
Brandt?
I'm sorry, Portia.
I just think he's got
a little too much to overcome.
I mean,
the kid was in Special Ed.
I know sometimes we subconsciously
identity with applicants...
...who remind us of ourselves,
but honey, no.
OK then.
Pen)'-
Wait!
Polokov called him inspirational!
Portia, please.
Sit down.
It's too risky.
He's just not Princeton material.
I'm actually surprised
that you thought he was.

Tenisha Jones.
Brearley School, Manhattan.

Listen to my tale
Man, it's really sad t got
those tiger-town blues and I got them bad
I've been hanging around
at the Nass a“ day
Hoping to drown
my blues away
Oh Lord,
I got those tigenown blues
Now these Princeton boys,
they're a bad bunch of boys
And they realty know
how to spread their joys
They've been running around
when they ought to be in
Hitting those books
instead of a bottle of gin
Oh Lord,
I've got those tiger-town blues
Those tigerlown blues
(we never work at all)
Those tigertown blues
(that's why we're singing now)
Portia Nathan.
Hey, this is Bob Barrow
from Hotchkiss.
I wanted to talk to you
about one of our applicants.
All decisions have been made.
Yes, but I wanted you to know
that Jesse Bolton is going to Yale.
Definitely.
He was just in here.
Even though he's a legacy,
he's definitely going to Yale.
So look,
if you accepted him...
maybe that place can go
to another of our students?
Instead of Jesse
just rejecting Princeton.
Thank you for your call,
but all decisions are absolutely final.
No changes can be made.
Yes, but-
Password
Love, Aleksai
Aleksai.
Final Accept-Deny
Bolton, Jesse
Balakian, Jeremiah
I'm sorry you feel that way.
No, there isn't
an appeals process.
How wonderful that Elissa
got so many acceptances.
Harvard and Yale too?
Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about the financial aid package we could offer.
No seriously,
I'm so happy too.
No, you rock.
Yes,
I know he is a legacy...
...and I certainly understand
why you would never want to give...
another penny
to this university ever again.
Wow.
That is a new one.
You're our angel on earth
I hope you get rectal cancer
Portia Nathan.
Hey, I have somebody here
who wants to talk to you.
- I got in.
- Yes, I know.
This is the best day of my life!
The best day of your life?
Well that's...
...good, good,
that's...I'm very happy.
Look, we're having
a school dance here tonight...
and I think
you should come and celebrate.
There you are.
Clarence wants to see you.
Yes, thank you.
I've been expecting that.
I have to go.
I'll call you later.
Have a seal, please.
- So, I had a call.
- Oh yes?
From Richard Bolton.
Class of '81.
Father of Jesse Bolton.
Do you recall Jesse Bolton?
Budding journalist...
writes for the Boston Globe -
is this coming back?
I remember Jess Bolton.
We loved Jesse Bolton.
We accepted Jesse Bolton.
And yet...
So I asked for the admit list.
Looked for Bolton, Jesse.
No Bolton, Jesse.
But I did find Balakian, Jeremiah.
We sent Mr. Balakian an offer of admission,
which he accepted.
The only thing is...
I don't remember
making him an offer of admission.
But I do remember
your plea that we do so.
You have exposed this office...
...and the University
to a completely undeserved scandal.
If word of this were ever to get out,
the damage would be irreparable.
Well, I won't tell anyone.
That's right.
You won't.
What you will do
is submit your resignation...
...and take this week
to clear up your affairs.
And then...
...I don't ever want to see you
in this building again.
He's going to Yale.
Jesse Bolton.
The guidance counselor called me.
We never had a shot at him.
Yale!
Well,
that's not the point.
I assume
you will be standing by the offer?
Well I don't see
how we can rescind it...
without the whole thing
blowing up in our faces.
The whole system
would be questioned.
We wouldn't
want that to happen.
Yeah?
Oh hi,
glad you're here.
I was just coming down
to the dance.
- You OK?
- Yeah, why?
- You just seem kind of intense.
- I'm OK, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm great.
I'm supposed
to be chaperoning this dance.
You're doing a great job.
You can do this.
You having fun?
This is the best day
of my life.
You have no idea
how happy that makes me feel.
I want so much for you
to be happy and...
...for you to have all the things
that you want in life.
Thanks.
You know how when you're swinging
on a rope swing across a stream...
...and you're afraid to jump in
and then you just do?
No, I'm kind of afraid of heights, so...
Me too.
That's...
You and I
have so much in common.
That's not as odd as it seems.
Jeremiah,
there's something I want to tell you...
...and it's going to come
as quite a shock.
I'm your mother.
- What?
- Your birth mother.
I've been trying to figure out
the best time to tell you...
and I know,
I was speechless loo.
No, it's not that.
- It's just...you're not my birth mother.
- Yes, I am.
And I know this is very sudden
and I don't expect-
No, my birth mother
is named Janie Schroder and.-.
She's a hairdresser from Keene.
And I met her and my half sisters
a couple months ago.
I put my name in at the adoption agency
and they contacted me-
No, Jeremiah...
...you were born on Valentine's Day
at 1pm at Blaine General.
To me.
No, I was born at 11pm.
They said my mom
tried like hell to hold off till the last hour...
.-.so I wouldn't have some lame
Valentine's Day birthday-.
It's a copy - see?
That's an eleven
with one of the ones missing.
It's faded, you see?
I never told anybody because I didn't want
my parents to find out.
I was worried
that it would hurt their feelings.
And I don't want to hurt them,
because they're my parents.
Of course.
This whole time you thought
you were my mother?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want anything getting in
the way of you getting into Princeton.
I'd have to recuse myself.
So everything you did
was because you thought I was your son?
No.
I completely believe in you.
I actually do.
You were lying to me
the whole time.
I don't understand.
I can't tell what's real.
I don't get it.
- How did it go?
- 11pm, not 1pm!
- What?
- Just stay out of my life!
Or what's left of it.
Hey!
Hold on.
Janie Schroder. A hairdresser.
His mother is a hairdresser.
What?
No, I read the birth certificate.
A copy.
A faded copy.
- Look!
- What?
Eleven.
That is supposed to be an eleven.
None of this was true.
This is all a stupid dream.
This is all in your head
and I just jumped in like a complete idiot.
I can fix this.
I'll contact adoption services-
No!
Do not fix anything!
I don't want to ever see you again!
Go be a citizen
of the planet!
I am so glad that you are going to Ecuador
except for one thing.
What?
I feel sorry
for the Ecuadorians!
Hi. Come on in.
You can help me grind sausage.
I've got something to say,
Susannah.
Having sex on a train with a stranger
to gel pregnant - really not so great!
You didn't even ask his name.
And so I will never know
who my father is.
Maybe he's in Paris.
Maybe he's in Hoboken.
Maybe he's president.
Obviously not that.
But I'll never know.
Because you forgot one important thing
on your way to self-empowerment.
Me!
Why didn't you ask his name?
- Why don't you just shut up.
- No, you shut up!
I got pregnant,
and I had a kid.
Back in college.
And I gave him up for adoption.
I wasn't in the Netherlands.
I was living above an auto repair shop.
Hiding.
From you.
Because I can't stand you.
And that's it.
That's all I have to say.
Except,
gel some goddamn dog food.
Wait,
Portia! Portia!
Portia, don't leave!
Don't leave!
Portia!
Wait, wait!
I didn't ask the name
of the man on the train because...
...actually,
I didn't have a grand plan.
I made all that up.
It was all an accident.
A happy accident,
because it led to you.
Baby, it led to you.
And I wished so many times
that I could have told you his name.
It's one of the disappointments of my life
and I am so sorry.
Please, come back in.
Mom, I have to go.
Dad?
MY car!
Really?
What happened?
Are you OK?
It's a slight fracture.
Fender bender.
It's dumb.
I'm sorry,
I mean, about everything.
I was stupid and selfish.
A selfish asshole.
And I just wanted to come here and...
...tell you that I'm sorry.
Wait.
How's Nelson?
Good. He's good.
How's his Spanish?
Terrible.
Is he ready for Ecuador?
We're not going to Ecuador.
- You're not?
- No. I passed on that job.
Nelson wanted to stay put and...
...you know,
I finally realized that...
...I want him to be happy.
So this decision, right now...
...I'm going to let him make it.
Nelson really likes you.
Nelson likes me
because I'm so boring.
- You're not boring.
- I'm pretty boring.
You're not boring.
I think you're exquisite.
- You want to go out sometime?
- Yes.
- I mean with me.
- Oh- Yes-.
Good.
I thought it was important
to acknowledge that it's maybe-
It's good to clarify.
I think so.
NO ADMITTANCE
Portia Nathan?
So, tell me about yourself-.
I worked in college admissions
for sixteen years.
I used to spend my days
passing judgment...
...on young people who were
way more together than I was at their age.
I'm figuring out
what I want to do next.
I've been living at my mom's place
for the last two months.
I thought
that would drive me insane but...
...actually, we're going to be throwing a graduation
party for a kid who I thought was my son.
He's a great kid.
I killed my bonsai tree
by over trimming it.
I got pregnant in college and my boyfriend
had already dumped me for someone else.
I didn't realize
until I was very far along...
...and I didn't think
I could be a mother.
Ever.
Portia?
Did you mean it
when you said I could do this?
Yes.
I meant it.
- Thanks.
- You're going to do great there.
My boy, if you are truly outstanding
you'll probably be kicked out of there after one term.
- Cut it out, Vlad.
- Excuse me.
Don't listen to him.
Did you decide what your major is?
Philosophy, love.
Not philosophy,
women's studies.
You know, that's
enough philosophy.
And if your biological son
chooses to contact you'?
How would you feel?
I would feel...
...nervous, but...
...lucky.
I would feel lucky.
I would just be grateful
to get to know him.
I overwalered it too.
The bonsai.
I just drowned it.
- It's OK.
- OK.
I can't promise anything...
.-.but we'll contact you
if there's any news.
OK.
Hey!
Hey.
It's a thin envelope.
That doesn't mean anything.
Open it.
It says he's not ready
to meet me at this time.
OK.
Well then...
You're on the waitlist.
That's not so bad.
No, it's not.
Right.
Hey Portia.
Everything OK?
Yes.
What's the secret
to getting in'?
I can't tell you.
You have to find out
for yourself.
