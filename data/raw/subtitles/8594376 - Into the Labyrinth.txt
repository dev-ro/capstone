Sam?
Sam?
Don't worry, dear,
everything's okay.
Sam, do you hear me? Sam?
Do you hear me?
Sam, you're safe now.
Sam, do you understand
what I'm saying?
Is that better?
Sam, do you understand
what happened to you?
But you know
who you are, right?
Sam?
You know, right?
You know who...
This is a game.
I'm sorry? I don't understand.
I'm Dr. Green,
and I'm here
to help you remember.
You see...
Code red, third floor.
You've been through a lot.
And,
you were given a very powerful
psychedelic drug.
And that's why you're confused.
But the doctors
gave some medicine to you,
it's a kind of antidote,
if you will,
to bring your memory back.
Think about how lucky you are.
You only have a broken leg.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You have no need to worry.
This is a game.
Okay.
Let's try something else.
Where do you think you are
right now?
In the labyrinth.
We're at Saint Catherine's,
we're in a hospital.
Are you a doctor?
Kind of.
My job is to find evil men
like the kidnapper
who put you in a prison
you call "a labyrinth"?
I was kidnapped.
Who am I?
Your name?
Your name
is Samantha Andretti.
And you disappeared on a cold February
morning while you were going to school.
Last night,
a patrol car found you
and you were in
a state of shock.
And you were on a road
in the middle of a swamp.
The kidnapper
might have released you
or you may have managed to find
a way to escape, we don't know.
Behind that mirror,
police officers are listening
to every word we say.
There aren't any mirrors in the
labyrinth, mirrors are forbidden.
Oh, well, there you go.
So if you're here,
and there's a mirror,
then you're no longer
in a labyrinth, right?
Sam, unfortunately
we can't wait
for the antidote to the
psychotropic drug to take effect,
we have to know
what you remember now.
You wouldn't want what happened to you
to happen to another girl, would you?
No.
Then you have to help me
capture this monster,
because that's what he is.
Me?
We still don't even know
his name.
But we will find him,
you and I together.
You see, he doesn't know,
but there's one place
no one can escape from,
and that's where
we will track him down.
Because he is not outside,
but inside your mind.
This is a game?
No, no.
My dear Sam,
you've been rescued.
Rescued?
Yes.
Sam, I know why the kidnapper didn't
want any mirrors in the labyrinth.
He didn't want you to know...
What?
That time was passing.
Sam, you were kidnapped
fifteen years ago.
Now, Sam, I want you
to go back with me
into the labyrinth.
Don't worry,
this time I'll be with you.
Are you ready?
What's your first memory
of the labyrinth?
Gray.
The walls are gray.
No, they change color.
They're alive.
Where I am has no end
and no beginning.
If that's true,
how did you get there?
I don't know.
Are you alone?
No.
Can you see or hear anybody?
No.
Well, so how can you say then
that you're not alone?
The cube.
The cube?
The first game was the cube.
I woke up and it was there.
Why? Why was it there?
Who put it there?
I don't know.
At first it scares me,
but I'm hungry.
I'm so hungry.
I don't wanna think
about being hungry.
so that's why I pick
it up and I start to play.
I earned that food.
And did you keep playing?
And I got a bed.
I realized soon enough,
that the game
got more difficult.
As I progressed.
I didn't get any other reward.
And I got hungry again.
But that wasn't the problem,
cause I started
getting thirsty.
No one ever tells you this,
but..
being thirsty,
is much worse
than being hungry.
You feel like...
beating your veins open so at
least you can drink something.
I regretted it right away...
and I tried to make up for it.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,
I will never do it again,
forgive me.
I will never do it again.
Every time I needed something,
food, a toothbrush,
a change of clothes,
all I had to do was finish
the first labyrinth.
I didn't understand what fun there was
in forcing me to play that stupid game.
I mean,
finishing the first one
wasn't that hard,
but then I understood.
If I finished all the mazes,
he'd let me leave.
He?
Who is "he"?
The labyrinth.
That what happened?
You completed the cube,
and then the labyrinth
let you go?
I never got through
the fourth side.
Sam?
Do you feel
like calling someone?
May I?
Of course you may.
What's the matter?
Hmm?
I don't know who to call.
I don't remember anyone.
Well, after fifteen years,
that's normal.
They've forgotten about me,
haven't they?
Oh, you shouldn't say that,
it's not true.
Yes it is.
Too much time has passed.
Sam,
when the antidote is finished
cleansing your blood
of the drug,
you may want to call a friend.
I wasn't alone
in the labyrinth.
There was a door.
Tell me about the door, Sam.
Hey!
Do you hear me?
Are you there?
Don't be afraid,
I won't hurt you.
He just wants
to play games with us.
I don't like to play.
If you don't play, no food.
If you don't play,
you'll starve to death.
It isn't hard,
I'll teach you.
Hi.
Hi.
Is everything okay?
Are you hungry?
I have some food over there.
You can wash up if you want.
You need to eat and sleep,
otherwise you won't be ready.
You never know
when a new game will begin.
I know everything,
I am the game.
He promised me
he'd send me home after.
I don't know how long
it went on.
What are you talking about?
Maybe days or weeks.
She begged me.
Sometimes she cursed me.
You bitch! Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Fucking whore!
And then...
she started asking for food
and water.
And then nothing.
And when I smelled the stench,
I knew that the game was over.
And I had won.
Sam, was there ever a time
in the labyrinth
when you were...
Happy?
What kind of a question
is that?
Why in the world
would I have been happy?
You wouldn't have survived
fifteen years
if you were in
complete terror every day.
I think terror is the perfect
place for monsters to hide,
because when you have
strong emotions,
that overwhelms real memories.
If we want to find out
something about your kidnapper,
I think we've got
to search elsewhere.
A cat?
You were right.
I... I can,
I can still feel his,
his little heart beating
while I hold him.
You know what, Sam?
It's a good thing
you remembered that.
You know?
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
I'm curious,
how do you think a cat
landed in the labyrinth?
This isn't another
mean game, is it?
- No.
- No.
No, the kitten wasn't a game,
it was a gift.
Why would your kidnapper
give you a cat as a gift?
I'm sorry,
but I don't understand.
I don't know.
Sam, are you sure there
really was a cat with you?
What do you mean,
that I made it up?
You don't believe me?
Why don't you believe me?
I'm not making it up!
I remember!
Fuck you, I'm not crazy!
I didn't say
I didn't believe you.
I'm only saying
are you sure
it really was a real cat?
It's a legitimate question.
Sam, I'd like you to,
just unbutton
your nightgown here.
It's all right, you can go ahead.
I'm giving you your privacy.
It's important.
Why did I forget?
I don't believe you forgot,
Sam.
I think it was the drugs
the kidnapper gave you
so he could control your mind.
What do you think
happened to the baby?
Oh God,
I don't know, Sam.
But maybe
we can find out together,
you know?
Keep sleeping, darling.
You need to rest.
Keep sleeping.
Keep sleeping.
Keep sleeping.
Sam, feeling better? Hmm?
Did I bring the baby
into the labyrinth?
I don't think
you were already pregnant
when you were kidnapped.
Do you?
No. No, it can't be.
There must be
another explanation.
Oh, I wish there was,
but there isn't.
No, there must be...
There must...
Sam.
- No...
- Come on.
You're saying that you never,
ever, ever, ever
saw your kidnapper's face,
right? How is that possible?
Exactly...
I've never seen his face.
Your daughter might still
be in the labyrinth.
And she's waiting for you.
No!
No, no!
She's waiting for her mother
to come and rescue her.
No, fuck you,
Doctor Green!
No!
- Come on, Sam.
- No.
- Come on!
- No!
Come on, come on, come on!
Just say it to yourself
as well as me,
the times that your kidnapper came
to visit you in the labyrinth.
Just try to be honest
with yourself, that's all.
The dark.
I called it the game
of the dark.
You really wanted to know,
right, Doctor Green?
Are you happy now, asshole?
No, of course not.
I've never seen
that bastard's face.
Sam, I thought
you might be hungry.
Tuna, or chicken salad?
Chicken salad? Perfect choice.
The food here at Saint
Catherine's is disgusting.
But I have to tell you,
nobody can beat my wife in
the chicken salad department.
Oh! No!
Damn, I'll never hear
the end of this.
My wife is gonna kill me.
Tuesday was pizza day.
How did you know
it was Tuesday?
I didn't.
I decided it was.
If pizza came, it was Tuesday.
I always wondered
who made that pizza.
I, I imagined a guy, and he...
He'd work to help out
his family and...
And he'd like to buy
a motorcycle one day
and take his girlfriend
out dancing.
That pizza was my only contact
with the outside world.
It was the proof
that humanity wasn't extinct,
That, that the world outside
wasn't over.
Yet.
Well you know,
now that you're free
maybe when you leave
you can find out
where your pizza man is.
You'll have to excuse me
a moment.
Hello?
You forgot the address!
Hello? Hello?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I need your address for the order.
Your pizza,
where should we deliver it?
Dr. Chang to
Cardiology, Dr. Chang to Cardiology.
Hey!
Hey!
Dr. Chang to
Cardiology, Dr. Chang to Cardiology.
What's your first
memory of the, of the labyrinth?
Gray.
The walls are gray.
No, they change color.
They're alive.
Where I am has no end
and no beginning.
If that's
true, how did you get there?
I don't know.
Sam, I have incredible news.
Guess what?
We found him. Your kidnapper
has been arrested.
You know, we could not have done it
without you. You should feel very proud.
So we're done here.
Yes, my dear Sam.
Where will you go now, Dr. Green?
I'm going to go back home.
But I promise I'll visit soon.
Do you have a nice house?
Yes, and a nice mortgage
to go along with it.
What's your wife's name?
Adriana.
- Do you have any children?
- Yes.
What are their names?
How can you be so interested
in my life?
My life isn't that interesting.
I want to know.
Johanna is my eldest, she's 36.
Then there's George, 34.
And finally Marco, who is 23 years old.
What do they do?
Marco is at university,
studying law.
George just started his own
computer programming company,
with a few friends.
And, uh, Johanna got married
last year,
she's a real estate agent.
How did you meet your wife?
College.
We've been together
over fifty years.
Was it hard to win her over?
I had a crush on her best
friend who introduced us,
and then I just
couldn't stop thinking
about my future wife,
so I kept pestering her
until she agreed
to go out with me.
Did you ask her to marry
right away?
After about a month.
With a ring?
Couldn't afford it.
So I just asked her,
and that was that.
Is it an antidote in my IV?
No.
What's in it, then?
A psychotropic drug.
Are my memories real?
A few.
The rest,
self-induced hallucination.
Is my leg broken?
I would never hurt you.
When was the real
Samantha Andretti found?
A year ago.
How long have I been here?
367 days.
Why did you make me believe
I was Samantha?
It's a game.
Who are you?
Who am I?
I'm sorry,
this round I am the winner.
Congratulations.
You played very well.
What will happen now?
What happens every time.
You'll sleep peacefully,
and when you wake up,
you won't remember a thing.
How many times
have we played this game?
Countless times.
It's our favorite.
You've been rescued.
Feeling better?
Your daughter might
still be in the labyrinth.
Tell me about the man
in the labyrinth.
It's a game.
Who are you? Who am I?
[screams
Alice.
Influences thoughts in others,
gentle manipulator,
a tamer.
Seven across,
nine letters.
Exactly.
What do you do?
Ah, interesting.
Me? I'm retired.
Oh, uh,
I invent games,
sometimes I, uh,
I design labyrinths.
Labyrinths, yes.
Oh.
Thanks for suggesting the word.
