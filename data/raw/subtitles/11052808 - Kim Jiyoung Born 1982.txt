Rain clouds from the west brought rain
or snow overnight.
But from the morning...
Shouldn't we solve the problem?
Watch the traffic and drive safely.
Here's a story we've received.
"I dream of flying in space..."
Mommy!
Mommy!
Hello.
How may I help you?
Well, it's not me but my wife...
Then she has to come herself.
I'd like more information first.
A-yeong.
What are you doing, babe?
He's stressing me out.
- Maybe he likes you.
- Isn't he divorced?
- He has a kid.
- What a nightmare.
What a comfortable life.
She'll hear you.
I'm just jealous.
I wish I could drink coffee and rest
on my husband's paycheck.
Then find a husband.
That's insane.
I hate work. Should I get married?
How about Mr. Kim?
Mommy!
A-yeong, Mommy's coming.
Mommy!
- A-yeong!
- Mommy!
- Mommy!
- Say "ah"!
Swallow. That's it. Good girl!
Daddy's here!
- Daddy?
- Yes!
- Let's wash up quickly.
- Okay.
I came home early to do it.
Thanks. You must be hungry.
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.
Daddy's here!
- Want me to bathe you?
- Okay.
- I forgot your soup.
- It's okay. Just eat.
Hands together.
There.
Your wrist hasn't feeling any better?
It's because I use it a lot.
Know what's upsetting?
The doctor asked
why it hurts when machines
make rice and do the laundry.
What?
Work didn't get easier
with electronic approvals.
Exactly.
I get upset about everything these days.
It's weird.
That's not weird.
How can you ask
a sick person why she's sick?
At New Year's...
How about traveling?
Let's not go to our families.
Or how about just resting at home?
I'm really tired these days.
Your mother would be furious.
And I do all the work, not you.
We can go next time.
I'm too tired to drive
all the way to Busan.
The traffic will be nuts.
You're too late.
- What?
- When we first got married,
I said going down
for your parents' birthdays
and major holidays was tough.
But you said that's only a few times
a year and we should go.
Why change now?
I went down even at full term.
If we don't go, who'll be blamed?
Not their precious son, but me.
Good girl!
It's the first day
of the New Year holiday.
There are less gridlocks
compared to other years.
As the holiday is five days long,
traffic appears to be dispersed.
Highway tolls are waived
this year as well.
Finish up and let's start
making dumplings.
Yes, Mother.
Why so much? Are we selling dumplings?
Who'll eat all that?
What's wrong with you?
They have great take-out food these days.
I heard it's delicious.
Why order food for your family
to eat together like this once a year?
Well, it's a lot of work.
Be honest.
Are you worrying about me?
Look at all the dishes!
- It's okay, I'll do it.
- Just go.
My son is a modern husband.
I do it all at home, Mother.
I didn't say anything.
Why question me complimenting my son?
That's not what I meant.
If you had another son,
you could've worked less.
Why didn't you try harder with Dad?
Go at it day and night, you know?
Are you crazy?
A-yeong.
Want an uncle?
Cut it out!
What's with you two?
Mother?
Why not sleep more?
I'm wide awake.
Do you want all this spinach to be boiled?
-Yes.
Wait! I have something for you.
I hope you like it.
What's this, Mother?
BUSAN BANK
Mother, it's so pretty!
- Isn't it?
- Yes.
You like flowers, right?
- Yes.
- I stood in line for hours
to get it for you.
Thank you.
It's your friend, Pororo!
Don't like it? Okay.
You don't like it?
See this, Grandpa?
I packed everything.
Let's go once you're done.
Okay. I'll hurry.
Mother! We're here!
Let's go inside.
- My son-in-law!
- Grandma!
Don't run.
We bought this on the way. Isn't it cool?
- It's very cool!
- Hi, you're here.
Still here, Ji-young?
I was worried you'd be gone.
Of course, they're still here!
What's New Year's without seeing family?
A-yeong! My niece!
Ta-da! Isn't it pretty? Look!
When did you buy that?
Anything for my little niece.
I bought this, too!
- Isn't it cute?
- So pretty!
- Daughters are the best!
- Right.
She's so pretty!
Lucky you, A-yeong.
Auntie bought you pretty dresses!
Right!
- Yes, Mother!
- My granddaughter is the best!
- So pretty.
- She's so cute.
- That's great.
- It's good to be home.
It was hard in my in-laws'.
Right. Poor thing.
Will you bring some food and dessert over?
I can get it myself, Mom.
Don't bother. You worked at your in-laws'.
Ji-young! Go rest if you're tired, too!
- Isn't it cute?
- It's perfect!
She's a princess!
The pin is pretty, too.
- So pretty.
- Of course!
Mom, be honest. Is it me or Dae-hyeon?
Don't ask that.
- Buy me some clothes, too.
- Really?
Mrs. Jeong.
If you want Ji-young to rest,
send her home.
Think about it.
You're happy to see your daughter.
I miss my daughter, too.
What's she saying?
My daughter should've left
before yours came.
Why make Ji-young serve
your daughter, too?
Ji-young? What's wrong with you?
Mr. Jeong.
My daughter means the world to me.
She's not feeling well.
I'll explain later.
I need to use the bathroom.
Is the rest stop far away?
I'll stop at the next one.
Sis, Ji-young is a bit...
No, she's not well at all.
Make sure Mom doesn't call Ji-young.
Okay.
How can this happen?
Anything I can do to help?
No.
Just don't let Mom call her.
Okay, I'll make sure.
We should've paid
more attention to Ji-young.
It's okay. I gotta go.
Okay, bye.
How much longer?
Mom must be waiting.
You must be tired. Should we go next time?
No. I want to see Mom.
Good girl, A-yeong.
Did you miss Granny?
Eun-yeong? Bring Dae-hyeon a drink.
Ji-seok.
What? Mom told you to do it.
I'll get it myself.
It's okay. I'll get it.
Ji-seok!
Kim Eun-yeong!
Dae-hyeon? Do you know how hard it is
to live as a man in this house?
Hey! Think of all the benefits
you got since the '80s.
Right. I raised my precious son well.
Please stay out of it, Dad.
By the way, why isn't Ji-young waking up?
- She must be tired.
- Really?
Again, A-yeong.
Sis! Our country is so small!
The world is really big, huh?
- Wanna mark off where we want to visit?
- Sure.
- Get the stickers.
- Okay!
What color do you want?
- I'll take green.
- Then I'll take purple.
I choose America!
- And you?
- Me?
Sweden.
Denmark.
Finland.
Why go to such unfamiliar countries?
Because not many Koreans are there.
What do you mean?
Forget it!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Hey!
Cut the racket!
Why are you girls acting up
when we just moved here?
Girls must always be
quiet and calm, you know?
Come out and help your mom set the table.
Grandma!
She ate my candy and put germs on it!
So?
How was the wedding?
The usual, I guess.
He was sad you couldn't come.
You'll see your brother, right?
If everyone's living well, it's all good.
Mi-suk.
When you worked hard
to support your brothers' studies...
Stop!
That's enough, Mom.
Have lunch and go back.
Ji-young! Eun-yeong!
- Set the table!
- Okay!
Mrs. Kim.
Congratulations on the new house.
I enjoyed my stay for a few days.
I'm living well thanks to my second son.
I'm proud of my son-in-law, too.
Please have some. Let's eat!
There should be at least
four sons in a family.
I wish Mi-suk could have another son.
I'm saying it for your own good.
Just having Ji-seok...
It's not enough.
Grandma?
Your other sons won't see you.
Why insist on sons?
Watch what you say.
Who does she get her feistiness from?
I'm going to treat Mom well.
Listen to the girls speak their minds.
When you grow up and get married,
you'll forget about us.
No, I won't.
Ji-young. Eat lots.
Are you ready to go to Germany
as an exchange teacher?
Worrying about Kim Eun-yeong
is a waste of time.
Everyone's here?
Is today a special day?
Ji-young must still be sleepy.
- She must've been tired.
- Yeah.
Ji-seok? This pen...
Where'd you find that?
Under your desk.
Isn't that the pen Dad only bought
for Ji-seok during his trip to London?
You just gave us sketchbooks.
Remember, Dad?
Not that again.
Dae-hyeon.
Watch out for Kim Ji-young.
She's persistent.
She begged me for over 10 years
for that pen.
You're even worse
for not giving it to her.
- Honey, isn't it weird?
- What?
Why didn't your mother
pack us any food this time?
I said I wouldn't take any. I had enough.
Really?
I don't remember that.
I'm so forgetful these days.
You can become forgetful
after giving birth.
Someone on our team had a baby recently.
His wife has postpartum depression.
Really?
I heard it's serious.
It shouldn't be overlooked.
It sounds scary. I saw it on the news.
Are you all right?
Me? Well...
I'm fine.
Sometimes, I think about the past
and get a sinking feeling at sundown.
But it's not often.
Do you want to see a psychiatrist, too?
Why? You think I'm crazy?
Who says that these days?
Many of my co-workers
seek psychological care.
Maybe talking to a psychiatrist
can stop potential depression.
Should I try going?
And ask why I get sinking feelings?
Right.
I heard of a good psychiatrist.
Try seeing her.
I'll give you her number. Okay?
I can't breathe.
What's with you these days?
Mommy!
Mommy!
- Good morning!
- Hi!
I'm not the first customer, right?
Who cares about that these days?
Women are always the first customers here.
Right.
- Dad? I'll take this.
- Okay.
- Take care.
- Bye!
- I heard she got a job.
- Yes. I'm so proud.
DAEHAN PLANNING TEAM SELECTION
The planning team has been selected.
- Did you see it?
- Yes.
Good morning.
- Congratulations.
- Pardon?
- You made the planning team.
- Congratulations.
I don't want to go there.
You should be thankful
Chief Kim chose you.
She only picked guys.
But Chief Kim is tough.
She's tough as nails.
She returned to work
a month after giving birth.
Who watches her kid?
Her mother lives with her.
Isn't her husband amazing?
Hold on.
Her mother raises her kid.
What's amazing about her husband?
Living with the wife's parents
is worse than the husband's parents.
- What?
- What?
Get ready for the meeting.
Yes, ma'am.
All done? Director Yang is here.
Already?
He's talking with Chief Kim.
Take this.
Why not play off the Beijing Olympics?
How about a sports star
like Park Tae-hwan?
Too expensive, right?
Chief Kim, isn't your son his age?
No, he's in middle school.
Middle school?
What a headache!
It'll hit you soon.
Kids who aren't raised by their moms
tend to be more rebellious.
My mom takes good care of him.
Grandmothers are not the same.
Kids need their moms at home.
Or something is bound
to go wrong later on.
Who cares about success
if you fail at raising your kid?
I'm so worried.
Why not use that in the advertisement?
Vitamins for children
not raised by their mothers.
Prepared with a motherly heart.
Then we'll get hit by working mothers.
Then you should be hit by me, too.
Chief? Isn't that a bit much?
What did I say, Chief Kim?
You scared me.
This is how Chief Kim
has survived this far.
It's too bad.
You should've been born a man, right?
Director...
- Shall we start the meeting?
- Sure!
Our campaign strategy is to heighten
digital media exposure.
Currently, digital media advertising
is around 10 percent.
We plan to increase it to 30 percent
and promote more participation.
Did you see Chief Kim
against Director Yang?
She's so tough.
She's too strong. You're so dead.
I was worried Director Yang would flip.
Then you should be hit by me, too.
Shall we start the meeting?
- Sure!
- Sure!
Ms. Kim Ji-young?
Could you come to my room?
Sure.
Here.
Great selection of articles
and appropriate comments.
I sent it to reporters
without making any changes.
Keep up the good work.
- Thank you.
- You may go.
Anything I can improve upon?
No. I called to compliment you.
What?
I thought you didn't like me.
Because of the planning team?
Yes.
Why didn't you take me on your team?
It's not because you're lacking
in some way.
The company wants
a long-term team of over five years.
It's hard for female workers
with marriage and parenting.
Even if I took you on,
it would've been hard on you.
I know I can do the job well.
Ji-young? Do I look happy?
Yes.
You think so?
I fall short on being a good mom.
And I gave up on being
a good wife or daughter long ago.
Still, you're amazing.
I can work well even after marriage
and having a kid like you.
- Shoes off.
- There you go.
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
- Wanna come over?
- Really?
Then let's invite
Eun-su and Su-bin's moms, too.
Ji-young?
We're having tea at my house.
You should come with us.
But I have something to do.
Are you working?
- Yeong-ho is so good!
- Oh, please.
- Make him a teen idol.
- No way!
What are you doing?
Come and have a seat.
- You have an older child?
- Pardon?
That book is mine.
I see.
- Come and sit here.
- Join us.
You solve them for hours?
It's strange, but I feel at ease
when I solve math problems.
Oh my.
She majored in engineering
at Seoul National University.
Wow!
I don't know why I studied so hard.
To teach multiplication to Yeong-ho?
- That's why!
- Yes!
- Now, I get it.
- Good!
What did you major in?
- Korean literature.
- Wow.
- Wow.
- Are you an author?
No. I dreamed of it once,
but I worked at a marketing company.
I see.
What did you major in again?
I majored in acting
to read books to Bo-ram.
Right.
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?
Snow White?
I'll kill her!
- How does Bo-ram respond to that?
- She cries.
But that actually felt good.
PART-TIME CASHIER WANTED
It's good to work in the mornings
while the kids are at school.
I'd keep working here
if I didn't have to move.
It's easy to watch the counter.
I see.
Hi, Hye-su.
Sure! Come over.
A-yeong is so cute!
She speaks well now.
Already? Is she gifted?
No, she's not.
I think she takes after Dae-hyeon's
good language skills.
Right. He talks a lot.
She's so cute.
Why does Dae-hyeon look so good
when you're withering?
It's hard on him, too. He helps out a lot.
Of course he should help!
Right.
Wait! Big news.
Chief Kim is quitting.
- Why?
- She's done with the company.
Who cares if she's good?
She can't go any higher.
She's setting up her own company.
She rounded up the marketing team.
Mi-jeong is joining her.
What about you?
I got promoted recently.
So I'll stay for a bit.
Congratulations!
No need.
The men who started out with me
were all promoted last year.
Thinking about it makes me so mad!
Still, I'm jealous.
Give Chief Kim a call.
- Me?
- Yes!
Go back to work.
I can't.
I can do part-time jobs,
but not a full-time career.
Fine. Don't. Raise A-yeong well.
That's an amazing job, too.
You're like a queen, and I'm a maid.
I'll work all my life and then die.
Not funny? I said I'm a maid.
It's funny.
Then laugh, will you?
You're funny!
JOB SEARCH KOREA
NO JOB MATCH
Bye!
Ms. Kim...
Are you all right?
- I thought I was late and ran.
- I see.
A-yeong!
POSSESSED
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
I SOMETIMES GET DAZED
FROM POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
I GOT OVER IT WITH EXERCISE
POSSESSED
MY WIFE SEEMS TO BE POSSESSED
HUSBANDS MUST PRAY MORE
Everything tastes bad.
Isn't it hot?
What's that?
Look.
What are you watching?
It's nothing.
Bye.
What was it?
It's obvious.
They make chat rooms
and share dirty pictures.
They're animals.
- So pathetic.
- I'm jealous.
What?
I mean I'm jealous they have time
to do pathetic things.
When I go home my kids want to play,
my wife is stressed out.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm so depressed.
I think I should see a shrink.
Seeing a psychiatrist
would help with depression, right?
Life's hard for you, too?
Let's go together.
You should try it.
You don't look good these days.
No, it's not me.
My friend's wife sometimes talks
as if she's someone else.
What? Is she possessed?
I don't think so.
Then she's crazy.
Does she know she's like that?
- I don't think he told her.
- Why not?
He's scared.
Of course.
- She could get worse if she knows.
- Right.
Living with her must be a horror.
What if she turns into a shaman
and runs around with a knife?
- He's bound to get stabbed.
- That's freaky.
Crazy women like her should be isolated.
Sorry. I thought I finished it.
What's with him?
What?
Wanna work out at a gym?
I don’t have time for that.
Exercise makes you
feel healthier and better.
Honey.
Should I work at a bakery?
The one down the street?
Is that what you want?
- Huh?
- Ji-young.
Not when you're...
It's hard enough raising A-yeong.
- It would just be in the morning.
- Don't do it.
- It doesn't sound hard.
- Who told you to work part-time?
Ji-young...
Ji-young.
I hate that you can't do what you want.
I can't watch you work
where you don't want to.
I know things are hard for you.
I just...
Thanks a lot for knowing things are hard.
You're drinking?
Are you mad?
You hate drinking.
Are you that angry?
I'm sorry.
Jeong Dae-hyeon.
It must be hard for Ji-young these days.
She may be comfortable,
but she's also worried and impatient.
Please say "You're doing great,"
"You're working hard,"
and "Thank you" to her often.
- Ji-young...
- I know you love your wife.
Stop saying her name.
Don't do this.
Still think I'm the 20-year-old
Cha Seung-yeon who had a crush on you?
Stupid.
Seung-yeon was my college classmate.
She was in Ji-young's climbing club.
Ji-young was really close with her.
She died while giving birth.
Ji-young took it hard.
She was devastated...
Could that be the reason?
I need to meet her directly.
Really, honey?
You sure I didn't drink?
Yes.
Really?
There was a beer can by my head.
I tasted it in my mouth.
Why can't I remember?
So go see the psychiatrist today. Okay?
Fine. I will.
- Promise?
- Yes. You'll be late.
- Promise!
- Okay!
PSYCHIATRIST
Hi, Ji-young.
- Are you at the shop?
- Of course.
- Is A-yeong at daycare?
- Yes.
- But...
- 25,000 won, please.
Would you like a receipt?
Hold on a second.
Thank you.
I'm busy right now.
Let's talk later, okay?
Wait.
Are you coming this weekend?
Of course I am,
but Dae-hyeon has a workshop.
I heard.
Welcome.
I'd better go.
- Fill out all this?
- Yes.
I see.
How much does the examination cost?
We'll run three tests.
They'll cost 350,000 won in total.
So I just left.
What?
Why? You registered to see her.
The examinations cost way too much.
I'm not that bad.
Ji-young, you're...
Honey.
Do I talk in my sleep?
Why do you insist
that I see a psychiatrist?
Well, you say you forget things
and have a sinking feeling.
Women become forgetful after giving birth.
And the sinking feeling is nothing.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
Don't worry. I'm fine.
CHIEF KIM
Hi, Ji-young.
Can I ask you something?
What is it?
Is Chief Kim's number the same?
Yes.
- She's here. Wanna talk to her?
- I can't.
No, it's okay. Talk to you later.
- Okay, bye.
- Fine.
Wait a minute. I'm coming.
Don't use the third floor bathroom.
Why not? Tell me.
Just listen and don't go!
You have to tell me why.
If not, I'm going.
Damn it...
Excuse me.
- What?
- Got any pads?
Yes.
Third floor is out of order.
Go somewhere else.
What? I was just there.
- Wait.
- What's wrong? Are you sick?
Girls!
A security guard set up a hidden camera?
- Yes.
- What happened to him?
He'll be indicted no matter what.
But Manager Oh makes me so mad.
If he saw the pictures online
and knew it was our company,
he should've reported it.
How can he share it
with other male co-workers?
That's crazy.
I only used the third floor bathroom.
I dread going to the police tomorrow
to verify the pictures.
They try to console us,
but I wonder if they saw my butt, too,
and get so mad.
I don't believe this.
Make sure you check
all bathrooms from now on.
Look for any holes.
What if I'm in a rush?
- A bedpan?
- We can't carry that around!
Got any of A-yeong's diapers on you?
Are you all right?
Would you like to sit?
No, thank you.
DAD, IT'S JI-YOUNG.
COME TO THE BUS STOP. HURRY!
Hey!
Didn't you hear me?
Excuse me!
Young lady!
- You left this on the bus!
- Damn it.
Oh dear.
You must've been scared.
It's okay now.
- Ji-young!
- Dad!
- What's wrong?
- It's okay now.
Why go to a tutoring school so far away?
Look for a new school.
Dress properly. Your skirt is too short.
And don't just smile at anyone.
I didn't! I don't even remember.
Why don't you remember?
You should be careful.
Stay alert and avoid problems.
If a rock rolls toward you,
will you stand still?
If you don't avoid it, it's your fault.
Understood?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Ji-young?
It's you, isn't it?
What do you mean?
What's with you?
Are you okay?
Mom!
I don't get it.
How can you just leave like that?
What in the world?
She has what?
I'm sorry.
Why in the world would you be sorry?
I gotta go back to work.
I'm going back home, too.
Stop by my house.
Just don't say anything to Ji-young.
How can I pretend I don't know?
I can't lie like that.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
So peculiar. Why can't she...
Oh my...
Hello, Mother.
I'm in Seoul right now.
You are?
I came to see someone,
and now I have to go back.
Why didn't you stop by here?
I have an appointment back home.
Anyway, I know a great oriental clinic.
I'll send some herbal tonics.
Make sure you drink them.
I should get it for you.
Eat well.
If you don't, your body will grow weak.
- I will.
- I'd better go. Bye.
Bye.
Where's the blue T-shirt?
It's hanging in the closet.
To the left.
Too bad your workshop is today.
Should I skip it?
No.
Take a cab there. Promise me you will.
If you get tired, call me.
Then will you come to help?
Just go. You'll be late.
Bye.
A-yeong? Daddy has to go.
Bye-bye! Kiss-kiss! Blow a kiss!
Looks like she pooped.
I'm sorry.
A-yeong!
I'm almost done. Hold on.
There! Let's go to Granny's.
Wait. Mommy has to pee.
Mommy peed, too.
Close the lid.
Your teacher writes neatly.
I wanted to be a teacher, too.
It's true.
I studied the best out of all my siblings.
Even better than your first uncle.
Then why didn't you become a teacher?
Because I had to earn money
for my brothers to go to school.
How did you earn money?
I made clothes at a factory.
It's okay.
Women lived like that back then.
Then why not become a teacher now?
I'm your mother now.
I have to raise you kids.
You can't because of me?
Mom.
Did you sleep well?
Has your birthday soup been made?
I can make it.
No, it's okay.
Go to Mommy, A-yeong.
Eun-yeong insisted
that I don't do anything.
As if she can cook...
She'll probably buy all the food.
She called Ji-seok to go out and help her.
Where's Dad?
He went to pick up his sisters.
It must've been hard
coming here by yourself.
She pooped on the way.
You did, A-yeong?
That's enough now.
"I just tapped your butt
because you're like my daughter."
Or
"I touched your six-pack
because you're like my brother."
"What's the big deal?"
They're not your daughter or brother.
It's sexual harassment.
You could end up in handcuffs.
Why do they give lectures like that?
What's the use?
It's for you to listen to.
Watch how you treat female staff members.
Times have changed.
Why you!
I should've been born
in the Joseon dynasty.
Come at once!
Leave at once!
There's so much to worry about.
Let's go with the flow.
I thought of my wife and got sad.
Should I just take paternity leave
like she wants?
Paternity leave?
My wife asked me to look into it.
Or she'll go and work even if
all her salary goes to a babysitter.
Try it if you want.
But you could end up like
Park in marketing.
When you return, your desk will be gone.
He got fired?
They won't say that.
But those who go on paternity leave
are promoted later
and struggle to settle back
in the company.
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Wow!
It's beautiful!
Thank you.
- How is it?
- It's pretty.
We should wear elegant things like this.
- You're right.
- Yes!
It should be more colorful.
- I love it.
- Whatever.
Ji-young?
Though it's hard raising a kid,
you should dress up and stuff.
Beauty is key to women.
- I'm pretty as is.
- Whatever.
You look washed-out.
Isn't Ji-seok home?
Right. Where did he go?
Here he comes.
Here.
Hello.
- What's all this?
- Hi.
You made all that food, Eun-yeong?
I can't cook.
I ordered it from a good restaurant.
For what?
Your mom could've just
whipped up a few dishes.
Mom always cooks a feast
on Dad's birthday.
Wouldn't it suck for Mom
to cook for her own birthday party?
Right! You're the best.
Ji-seok! Come here.
Your daughters are peculiar.
Why make your young brother
carry all the food?
He's not young! He's over 30.
He'll always be your younger brother.
Treat him well.
- But Auntie...
- I wish I had a daughter, too!
They care more for their family.
Good girl!
Thanks.
Aren't you getting married?
Auntie! Stop it.
Must seem nice now, but what about later?
If she's able to live alone, why not?
Able or not, I'll be fine on my own.
You are so different!
That's true.
Mom!
I just mean that you're extra special.
- Take out the tables.
- Okay.
- Ji-seok!
- What?
- What?
- Use your head.
I am!
- Why you!
- Silly kids.
It's always exhilarating
to see our eldest aunt, huh?
Why did Dad invite them?
You didn't lose once to her.
Aren't you tired?
Is that coffee?
I’m exhausted. Still, I have to fight.
Is there a game character
that gains more energy as it's hit?
I'll tell them to make
a character like you.
It'd be cool to have people
hit you like this.
- Ouch!
- Why you!
Look at Ji-seok's face.
He looks so funny.
What? I look cute.
I miss Grandma.
Grandma spoiled you big time.
She favored Ji-seok.
Still, he grew up to be a decent guy.
You're popular, right?
A little.
- Bow down.
- What?
I practically raised you, so bow.
Bow!
Why you!
That hurts, Kim Eun-yeong!
- Kids! Your aunts are leaving!
- Look at this.
- Coming!
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Oh no!
I kicked him hard,
and he dropped to his knees.
- Sis...
- Please, Kim Eun-yeong.
Watch it. You could get hurt.
I don't want to see you on the news.
Are you worried about me?
No need to worry.
I can hold my own against jerks like that.
True. Back in high school,
you and your friends caught a flasher.
Right!
I caught him and turned him over
to the police.
But my teachers yelled at me
and called us shameless girls.
I cursed those teachers back then,
but I became one.
You didn't want to be a teacher?
What?
Mom said you chose teachers college
because of us and cried.
Really?
Dad lost his job in the recession,
and you guys were young.
It was the right choice.
Sorry, because of Ji-seok and I...
What's with you?
You wanted to be an author,
but got a marketing job instead.
We can make little concessions.
You have matured.
Nope. I have rice cake.
- How childish!
- How childish!
Your students hate you, right?
No! I'm totally popular.
Who is it?
What's that look?
Got a boyfriend?
Sis! Stop it!
How have you been?
Good. How about you?
- Fine.
- How's everything?
Isn't your daughter
about two years old now?
She's 26 months old.
Though it's hard to raise kids,
they're cute, huh?
Yes.
- Chief.
- Hmm?
Were you surprised when I texted you?
Join us.
- Me?
- Yes.
It's the same as
working at Daehan Planning.
But I can only pay you 80 percent
of what you were making before.
Still, I'll make sure you get incentives.
Do you think I can do a good job?
I haven't worked for a few years.
Since when did you become a worrywart?
Do you not like our company
because it's small?
No way! I'm just thankful
you still want me.
Let's work together.
Great. Thank you.
I'll do my best.
For Ji-young's graduation,
should I close the shop
or just open at night?
Whatever.
I'm not going. I didn't even get a job.
You'll regret not having
a graduation picture later.
Forget it. I won't regret it!
- Ji-young!
- Enough!
Then stop everything!
Just stay home till you get married.
That suits you!
What in the world do you mean?
How can you say something so archaic!
Don't stay still, Ji-young!
Act up! Do what you want!
Okay?
Got that?
Jeez.
- Why you...
- Water!
- That's gross!
- That's gross!
Oh dear!
I'm not eating.
Just pick it off.
Hello?
Daehan Planning?
Yes.
I see.
Bye.
Mom! I got the job!
- Really?
- Yes!
Way to go!
Sis! I got the job!
Way to go!
- Dad.
- Well done!
Let's eat.
Keep eating.
Have some meat.
Eat up.
I met Chief Kim and talked about
going back to work.
Good! But is it possible for you?
I'll make it possible.
Of course! Good luck!
Thanks.
It's not my birthday today.
What is it?
Honey, I got a job!
So we'll have to send A-yeong
to daycare all day?
It'll be too hard on her
to stay till the evening at daycare.
I asked other moms.
It's good to find a babysitter
for 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. instead.
I see.
I also put her on a waiting list
for a babysitting service.
Good.
Honey.
Do you not want me to work again?
It's not that.
I'm just worried it'll be hard
on you and A-yeong.
Then should I not do it?
No.
I'm happy if you're happy.
Ji-young.
Honey!
Knock, knock.
Are you mad?
Yes, I am.
Don't mind what they said.
I'm hungry. Feed me, baby!
Stop it!
Why must we talk about having kids
in front of your parents like that?
Parents just say things like that
in passing.
They nag at you to get married,
and when you do,
they tell you to have kids.
If we have a son,
they'll say to have a daughter.
If we have a daughter,
they'll say to have a son.
I have a great idea.
What is it?
First, let's eat.
Tell me. What is it?
Instead of being nagged by my parents,
let's have a baby.
What?
Let's just have one. I'll be good.
We're not talking about buying
watermelons or oranges here!
We're going to have one anyway,
so let's just have one soon.
Having a baby won't change things
that much.
You really think so?
I'll do my best to help!
Jeez.
I'll change the diapers and feed the baby.
Everything will change for me.
But what about you?
Me?
It'll change for me, too.
I'll have to come home earlier.
I won't be able to drink or meet friends.
If the baby looked like you,
it would be so cute.
Stop! I'm depressed.
It's because you're hungry.
Make me food, please?
I'm seriously depressed!
Want me to make you happy?
Cut it out!
Honey! Are you okay?
- How's your back?
- Let's test it out!
Have my baby, please!
- Let's do it!
- Stop it!
Damn it.
She's still not here?
It appears that way, sir.
She used to do everything perfectly.
She's been a wreck since she's been back.
Here she comes.
I'm sorry.
He's too sick for daycare today.
Bring me the industry trend report
I asked for yesterday.
Yes, sir.
What's this?
Mommy told you to be quiet.
BABYSITTER NEEDED URGENTLY
You have to learn to pee
in the potty, okay?
Watch this.
Bye-bye, diapers!
Try it, A-yeong.
Bye-bye, diapers!
Bye!
BABYSITTER NEEDED URGENTLY
HOPE YOU FIND ONE
WHAT'S THE RATE FOR
BABYSITTERS THESE DAYS?
I didn't get any calls.
Really? Not even one?
No. I don't think it'll work.
No replies from job sites, either.
Let's get dressed, A-yeong.
Should I take paternity leave?
What?
I could watch her for a year,
then go back.
Maybe she'll be okay to stay
all day at daycare next year.
We'll find a way till she goes to school.
Your company is okay with it?
It's available to request.
Don't worry and do what you want.
I'll read books and study while I'm at it.
Honey!
Baby!
You love me more now, don't you?
I'm more dashing by the day, huh?
A-yeong! Mommy's going back to work!
- Give me a high-five!
- High-five!
Good girl!
WRITING GOOD REPORTS
PACKAGE LEFT AT DOOR
Black goat?
Keep playing. I'm calling Grandma.
Hi.
The herbal tonic came today.
Good.
I'll drink it and work hard at my company.
What company?
You're going back to work?
My former boss called me to work for her.
What do you mean?
Paternity leave?
Yes.
How could you do this to him?
- I can explain...
- Don't hinder his career! Use your head!
- Mother...
- I don't want to hear it. I'm hanging up!
Hello, Mrs. Jeong.
How much would a child's mother make?
If she wants to work,
why not get a part-time job?
Am I wrong?
How can she tell her husband
to take paternity leave?
Mrs. Jeong.
Ji-young studied a lot
and had a good career, too.
She's the one who gave birth
and is raising A-yeong.
They should take turns helping out.
If she's not well, she shouldn't work!
What do you mean she's not well?
You must not know.
Your daughter isn't normal.
Didn't you hear
what happened on New Year's?
Why did you tell her, Mom!
It's because I was frustrated
and worried about you.
You can't hide it forever.
Would you do that
if it were your daughter?
How can you say that?
So you'll make Ji-young work
when she's sick?
What if she gets worse
while she's at work?
Mom.
Why are you going to see Ji-young?
Close up shop for me.
Your phone.
Mother!
Ji-young.
I was just thinking about you.
It's not true, is it?
What?
Mom? Is something wrong?
It's nothing.
I just dropped by to see you.
Ji-young, be sure to eat well.
You have to be strong.
I'll move near you
and watch A-yeong for you.
So work.
I'll help you.
Do whatever you want.
I'll see you soon.
Take care.
Mi-suk.
Don't do that.
You worked to support your brothers
from a young age.
Whenever you gave me your paychecks
looking so tired and weak,
it broke Mom's heart.
My angelic daughter...
When you hurt your hand at work,
I was devastated.
I'm sorry I didn't console you
or thank you back then, Mi-suk.
I'm so sorry.
Ji-young will be fine on her own.
You raised her to be strong.
My poor girl.
My precious daughter...
My dear daughter...
Dae-hyeon?
What happened to her?
How did Ji-young get like this?
Ji-young!
No, Ji-young! Please...
No...
Mom?
Is something wrong?
Ji-seok got worried and called
to say something's wrong with you.
Did something happen at Ji-young's?
Ji-seok!
- Is it medicine for Mom?
- No way. She has a different one.
Take it.
Men should take good stuff like this.
It's yours.
What's this!
What the hell is this!
Is your son the only one you care about?
Ji-young is wasting away
not being able to do what she wants!
But you buy medicine
for your healthy son only?
- And you call yourself a father?
- What's with you?
Jeon's son opened a clinic,
so I bought a batch to help.
Exactly!
Why not buy some for your daughters, too!
She's sick because she grew up like this!
My poor baby!
My poor girl!
Ji-young! No!
Hi, Jeon.
I need to order another batch.
For my daughter.
It's Sunday. Got time to meet me?
Of course. You're the busy one.
Ji-young, are you sick?
Do I look sick?
You look down.
I guess I am.
Hye-su.
I don't think I can work
at Chief Kim's company.
- Why? Because of A-yeong?
- Yes.
There's no one to watch her.
What did Dae-hyeon say?
He said he'd take paternity leave.
Then you're set!
But his mother is totally against it.
Ji-young. Isn't that unfair?
You studied and worked
as much as your husband.
You're the one who had to give birth,
but you can share the load in raising her.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
His mother is not completely wrong.
I can't earn as much as my husband.
What I make may not be enough
to send A-yeong to daycare and stuff.
How frustrating.
Let's go.
She's asleep?
Yes.
She's getting fussier at bedtime.
I'll meet Chief Kim and tell her
that I won't be able to work.
Let's keep looking for a way.
There isn't a way.
I'm tired even before going back.
Fine. Rest a bit more.
You should rest.
When A-yeong is older, it'll get better.
Is raising kids resting?
I mean...
I know I shouldn't,
but I keep having doubts.
Maybe you don't want me to work,
like your mother.
Maybe you regret saying
you'd take paternity leave.
Ji-young. That's not true.
I don't mind taking paternity leave.
I said it for your own good.
Stop saying it's for my own good!
Honestly, I don't believe it.
You, Mother, and my family
are all the same!
It's just war to me!
Please calm down and listen carefully.
I told you to try going to a psychiatrist.
You are...
somewhat sick now.
What are you talking about?
Does it make you feel better to say that?
Where and how am I sick?
Sometimes...
you become someone else.
A-yeong!
What are you doing, babe?
Dae-hyeon. It's cold today.
The wind will be cold out.
Be sure to dress warmly.
You sound exactly like your mom.
A-yeong! Come to Granny.
Stop joking around.
What can I do?
Can I get treated?
It's good that A-yeong is still young.
Or she'd know that I'm weird.
You don't do it often.
Just once in a while.
This must've been hard for you.
I was so worried...
That I might lose you...
That you got sick like this
because you married me.
Tell her to put it
in the fridge right away.
- Okay.
- Here.
- Make sure it doesn't spill.
- Okay.
- Hello?
- Hi, Ji-seok.
Dad?
I'm going to Ji-young's
to deliver some food.
Do you know...
What she likes?
Ji-young? Sweet red-bean bread.
- Really?
- Yes.
What's all this?
It's for you to eat.
This is unexpected!
You never brought anything for me before.
Mommy?
Want some bread?
She doesn't like red-bean bread.
She takes after me.
You don't like red-bean bread?
I can eat it with the red-bean out.
What? Dad said you like this.
You like it. I like cream bread.
What's this?
Take it.
Can I really have it?
Buy me a better one next time.
It shows, you know.
I gotta go.
Bye, A-yeong.
- Stay for dinner!
- I can't.
Don't be sick, Sis.
I get to hear you call me "Sis"
because I'm sick.
Thanks, Ji-seok.
I'll buy you cream bread next time.
KIM JI-YOUNG
- We finally meet.
- Yes.
I'm the one who's sick,
but I was the last to find out.
How did you feel when you heard?
Surprised?
I'm scared.
Know what the hardest part is
for the patients?
To take the first step
and sit with me like this.
Sitting here is a sign
that your treatments will be successful.
I'm glad to hear that.
Hi, it's me.
Are you at work?
Yes, I just got here.
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes.
I ate as I fed A-yeong. How about you?
Your dad never misses breakfast.
Of course, I ate.
Mom?
Yes?
Remember when I was born?
Of course, I do. Like it was yesterday.
Cherry blossoms fell all around
on the day you were born.
On the way to the hospital
after my water broke,
it was so beautiful.
It looked like snow.
I must take after you.
It snowed on the day A-yeong was born.
And a beautiful daughter was born.
CONGRATULATIONS
It doesn't suit her.
Here.
Like our company name? Spring Breeze.
- Doesn't it suit me?
- Totally.
You're lying. It shows.
What's this for?
To congratulate you.
Thank you.
Why are you acting like a guest?
There's no fooling you.
What is it? Tell me.
I don't think I can work here.
Couldn't find a babysitter?
No.
Then how about working part-time?
I can't do that either.
I'm seeing a psychiatrist.
Who doesn't need to seek counseling
these days?
It would be risky for me to meet clients.
What if I say crazy things
during meetings?
When I'm well enough to work,
I'll be back.
Doctor?
I don't think it's so bad
living like this.
As someone's mom and wife.
Sometimes, I'm happy.
But sometimes,
it feels like I'm trapped.
I go around a wall to find an exit,
but there's another wall.
Then another one...
I think maybe there was no exit
from the start and get angry.
I see.
Then I realize
that it's actually all my fault.
Others found the way out,
but I don't have the skills to.
So I fell behind.
It's not your fault, Ji-young.
Then why am I the only one
who's a mess like this?
What did you do
when you were angry before?
KIM JI-YOUNG
Why are there so many women
with kids here?
It's crazy.
Let's go to no kids zones.
There are kids everywhere.
This place is the best.
It sucks.
- A-yeong.
- Right.
- A-yeong, wait.
- What's taking so long?
A-yeong!
Oh no.
- Stay.
- What a mess.
What a nuisance.
Why not drink coffee at home?
How can she clean that?
What a vermin-like mom.
She can hear you.
But she is shameless.
What a pity.
Let's drink at the park.
- Isn't it cold out?
- It's better than here.
- It's too noisy here.
- Right.
Excuse me.
Do you know me?
- Pardon?
- Why am I a vermin-like mom?
Let's just go.
Don't treat me like an insect.
I wasn't talking about you.
Who were you talking about?
I came to order coffee here.
You saw me for less than 10 minutes.
What do you know about me to insult me?
Do you know what I've been through,
who I know,
and what I'm thinking to judge me?
How would you like it
if I judged you at a single glance?
What is she saying?
We were just talking!
Then don't let others hear you.
Why are you trying so hard to hurt others?
- Let's go. Just drop it.
- Hurry.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Mommy!
Mommy!
It's okay, A-yeong.
I'm not crying.
Mommy's strong.
So don't cry, A-yeong.
No more tears!
Good! Let's go.
Did it feel satisfying?
No.
I didn't feel satisfied or embarrassed.
But...
It wasn't bad.
Honey, it's spring.
See the buds there?
Not again. What a crybaby.
I'm okay.
Let's go!
Daddy! Let's go!
- Did you have fun?
- Yes!
- Wanna go home?
- Okay!
- Are you hungry?
- Yes!
What do you want?
- Ice cream!
- We should eat rice.
Then rice cookies.
