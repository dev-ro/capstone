J' Time has come today J'
J' Young hearts can go that wayJ'
You ok, Cynth?
I mean, if you don't
want to do this,
You don't have to. That's
okay. Right, Harris?
No, Victor.
I say to you all now...
To all of you...
That this will be
the ultimate joining.
Of man...
And woman.
Parent...
And child.
Humanity...
And Godhead.
Cynthia.
Come.
There's no shame,
no sin. No guilt.
It's just the final break
with the old world.
As night falls, a
new day begins.
A day of unity.
You belong to
us forever.
Come to me,
my lovechild.
Come to eternal bliss.
Get it around the other side.
Just keep back please, thank you!
Stay back!
What have we got?
Twenty-four bodies,
Inspector. Maybe more.
Cause of fire?
Some kind of explosion.
Gas main, methane,
it's too soon to tell.
We got a survivor, get
a stretcher up here!
Sue Vaughn, with Channel 5.
Is there any l.D. on her?
What is her name?
One question, please!
Channel 5, Sue Vaughn.
Get outta here!
We have been told that Franklin
Harris is among the dead.
We are Channel 5,
live at the spot.
Hey.
Harris says something's
gonna come down...
Something heavy.
Life and death are simply
different states of being.
You just cross into
the next state.
Death is just this
really beautiful trip.
It's a great thing.
I can't wait.
You're afraid, Cynthia.
He put his hand
over a flame.
Unity.
He burns for our sins.
One spirit, one will.
I could kill you right
now, couldn't I?
You could.
But I won't.
Scared of Harris?
You can't escape.
Harris loves you, brother.
If I kill you, it's
because I love you.
Come to me, Cynthia.
Now. Now. Now. Now.
Now! Now! Now! Now!
You know I'll find you.
Cynthia.
How long has she
been in this coma?
Thirteen years, five
months, nine days.
Is that like, a, uh, world
record for a coma or something?
No, apparently the longest on
record is thirty-seven years.
Does she remember anything
about the fire at Unity Fields?
No, she appears to have no
memory of the accident itself
or of the days
leading up to it.
That is not uncommon
after serious trauma.
But what happens to her now?
Have they notified her
family or friends?
We stopped looking
for family years ago.
What kind of doctor
did you say you were?
I'm a psychiatrist.
What's a psychiatrist?
Well, a psychiatrist
is, uh...
Psyche, from the
Greek, means mind,
and chiatre is to heal.
So, uh, psychiatrist
is "mind healer."
Anyway, that's the idea.
You've been out of touch
for so long that, uh...
It's more than your muscle
tone that needs exercise.
Anyway, I have an assistant
named Dr. Carmen, and he
has a group therapy session
that meets every day.
I've enrolled you in
it starting tomorrow.
Well, I guess we
can get started.
Hello, Cynthia.
- Hi.
- Welcome. I'm- People, please?
So I'm Dr. Carmen, and I'd like
to welcome you to our little group.
I don't know how much
Dr. Berrisford has told you
about my methods; I
have my detractors.
I have my successes
too, Cynthia.
There was a hummingbird that was
just sitting out by
the little flower and-
There's a lot of
love in this room.
We're gonna get you
out of your neurosis.
We're gonna get you
out of your depression.
We're gonna get you out of that
mint green thing you're wearing
and into a flimsy negligee. We're
gonna pour water on the front.
Cynthia, I see us
on a desert isle.
You, me, a portable water
bed, it's beautiful.
Are you there? Are you
there with me? It's beautiful.
There's the sun, there's the
island, there's the water bed.
Ralph. Cut the shit.
Get out of my chair.
I was on the verge here of a major
breakthrough and you just blew it.
Ralph, the only thing you were
on the verge of was bad taste.
Sit down.
Cynthia, I'm Dr. Carmen. And I
doubt if my welcome can equal
Ralph's, but I'll try.
This is the borderline
personality group.
Welcome.
What is a borderline personality?
A borderline personality
is when, it, um...
Well, borders on two very
overused categories:
Psychotic, and neurotic.
- He's making this up.
- Go back to where you came from.
Go back to your
nether-world.
He has touched you.
He will take you.
Thank you, Gilda.
As a personality syndrome, we've been
exploring it for the
past couple of years.
It includes identity crisis, um...
Chemical addiction,
emotionalism, neuroses.
You forgot something.
Violent mood swings!
We're only violent when it's
absolutely necessary.
If we're just about
finished, I think we-
But we're not finished, Dr.
Carmen, and they will not
be finished until they make her
feel as miserable and pathetic
and confused
as they are.
I am confused.
You see? I hope you're all very happy.
- Honey, honey, please-
- Abe, not here, please!
I thought we decided no touching
in front of other people.
You decided that. I
didn't decide that.
You can't just do that
to me when I need
to touch you, you can't do it to me,
You can't, you
can't, you can't!
Oops.
- The crazy crew.
- Crazy? You said today's secret word.
There are no secrets here.
Excuse me, Dr. Carmen...
Um, I don't think I fit your
description of a personality.
You don't belong here.
You're not one of us.
Didn't Dr. Berrisford
explain why you're here?
He said that he thought that this
would help me fit into the eighties.
You want to fit into the eighties,
you're at least two divorces,
a condo, and a yeast
infection behind the times.
Why don't you just stick to the
seventies and move to Cleveland?
If I can offer a more
practical suggestion,
- Why don't you just talk?
- Talk?
About something
close to you.
Why don't you just quit fucking
beating around the bush and ask her?
Just ask her!
- Do you have to be so crude?
- Shut up.
Come on, Cynthia, dish out the dirt.
Tell us about the commune.
You know, the last gasp of
the age of Aquarius.
Building a better future
on what? Chemistry?
Good vibrations?
Tie-dyeing your undies?
Don't talk to her. She's a reporter.
She writes stories about Elvis
zombies from outer space.
They were from Atlantis.
I had pictures.
Shut up. Just tell us
about the orgies, Cynthia.
- She was a child at the time.
- So?
I'm sorry, I do not have
any stories like that.
But I will tell you what
I do remember.
What we felt.
What we believed was that if people
could become selfless enough,
if they could free themselves
from their egos,
They would experience a
kind of togetherness.
A oneness. A Unity. That is
where the name came from.
We had a dream about a perfect
society based on love and trust.
We weren't trying to change the world,
we were just trying to love each other
as much as we could.
Bullshit.
No!
It's not bullshit!
It's beautiful. It's
beautiful. It's not bullshit.
No! It's not bullshit!
It's beautiful. It's not bullshit.
Lana hasn't spoken to anyone
for three weeks, and now
love, peace, and Woodstock.
Am I missing something?
Yeah. She's espousing a
total belief system, Cynthia is.
Make a commitment,
make a decision to love.
And you're healed.
You're made whole.
It's not a new idea, Alex
Get rid of the troublesome ego.
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Go, ego. Run free.
I'm still not sure she
belongs in the group.
You don't have to be sure, Alex.
You don't have to come to a decision.
You know, the important thing
is that she recovers her memory.
Now she relates to you, she
likes you for some reason.
I don't know why, but she does.
So let's just press on.
Alright?
Drop down to first gear,
honey. It's Miller Time.
What are these?
Vitamins?
Beauty secrets from the Orient.
Look what they've done for me.
- Ralph.
- Hello!
You in a cooperative mood, or
do I have to tie you up again?
Promises, promises.
Open.
Next time it'll be lower.
She's crazy about me.
Hey, I've got a great idea. Why
don't you come up to my room?
And I'll catch you
up to date?
I got a hi-fi VHS VCR,
a CD, and MTV.
I don't think so.
You know what I do when it
all gets to be too much?
I make a little hole,
and it all escapes.
Well, there's the assistant
Ayatollah. See you later.
Can I buy you some lunch?
I've been watching the others.
They belong here. I don't.
And I'm feeling stronger, I'm
getting used to things,
Like VCS's and MCD's.
I want to leave.
Cynthia, we've been trying to
locate your family for years,
and we haven't come
up with anything.
Where would you go?
I'd find some people,
like at Unity.
Cynthia, there aren't any more
places like that. And the fire
that injured you took everything
with it. They're all gone.
I know that.
Yes, you do.
And I know this is a lot to take,
but it's a buried memory and
it needs to be uncovered, and
put in the proper place in your mind.
Maybe it's something you
could work on with the group.
Sooner or later, Cynthia, we
all have to move on.
The sooner you do, the better.
Let's catch this.
Would somebody hit eight, please?
It stopped!
Great.
I think this is the
fourth time this week.
Come on, why can't
you fix this thing?
Come on, open it up!
Excuse me.
Unity's coming here.
- Cynthia!
- Now and forever.
Come to us, Cynthia.
We love you.
You belong to us.
Forever.
Come to us, Cynthia.
We love you.
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Excuse me. Coming
through! Cynthia!
He's in there. He's in there.
He's in there. He's in there.
Cynthia, what happened?
- He's alive. He's in there.
- Who's in there?
He's in there. He's alive.
He's in there.
Well, first off, we're gonna feel a
little silly, and we're gonna look
- a little silly.
- I don't think it's silly.
I think it's really neat.
I'm glad.
But let's see if this
technique can help
release a little hidden aggression.
Alright, who's gonna go first?
- Lana?
- Hmm. Um.
I was wondering how many
helpless and defenseless geese
had to die to fill up these pillows.
They're polyester, honey.
Alright, well let's do the first one
all together. All right?
Ready?
One, two, three!
Outstanding. Truly
outstanding.
Alright, what are we
feeling? Gilda?
His power is transcendent. The
day of reckoning is at hand.
That's so weird. That's
exactly what I was feeling.
Ralph.
Miriam?
I was thinking about my first husband.
Or maybe the third.
What's the difference?
About four inches.
Cynthia?
I know it's hard. Try
to participate.
Alright. Let's try this one again,
only let's really let loose.
Miriam?
Ready? One, two, three!
Our love will never die.
You fail me, Cynthia.
You failed us all. All of us
make the same journey.
But you made us wait all
this time while you slept.
The waiting time is
over, my love child.
Come to us.
We were happy.
And we were going to make
our break with the world.
'Cause...
'Cause it didn't like us, and, um...
Their- Their faces, and
there was, uh...
Gasoline.
He put gasoline on us. And, um...
Somehow I knew it was
wrong, and I ran, and...
There was this big wind that
picked me up and threw me.
And then, I don't know, um...
When I opened my
eyes, I was here.
Why wasn't any evidence found?
Jerry cans would have been burned
up completely before anything else.
We knew there was an explosion.
We just didn't know how or why.
Well, Lieutenant.
You must be pleased to close
the case after thirteen years.
Who said it was closed?
What do you mean by that?
Well, Sleeping Beauty
here woke up.
She didn't remember anything about the
thirty deaths. So now she remembers.
It was a goddamn Jonestown.
A suicide pact.
Who knows what she'll
remember tomorrow?
If she ran for her
life like she says
or that she though the whole
thing was a nifty idea.
Hell...
Maybe she bought the damn gasoline
and helped pour it on the babies.
- That's enough.
- That's out of line.
Please, if you don't mind. Please.
That man's a candidate
for shock therapy.
A jumper cable right up his ass.
No, he's right.
They expected me to keep
my promise at Unity Fields.
And they still do.
Man, there's nothing
like a hot shower, huh?
Mm. Um, Cynthia.
Oh. Are you alright?
- I thought that after today, that, um-
- I'm fine.
You know what? There's a hole
where my heart's supposed to be.
It's like it hurts here,
because I'm empty.
Um, you know, what you
were saying about togetherness
and everything makes perfect
$9086 llo me.
Mm, you know, maybe there's
a little hope for me, sort of.
I think you want to help people.
Not, um, not like some others.
Um, if you need a friend here...
All of my friends are dead.
Oh. Oh. Okay. Um, if you need, um,
a friend, a new- A new friend, um-
Please.
Will you just leave me alone?
- Um.
- Please.
Leave me alone.
Lana, wait a second.
She didn't mean it!
Shit.
Look. Look! Lana may be a
little weird, even for this place,
but she means well.
I probably pull her chain too much,
but she's reaching out. We all are.
You should try to help her.
I can't help myself.
Cynthia.
Unity. Unity.
Cynthia.
- Unity.
- Join us.
Come here, my child.
Cynthia, you're now
part of the whole.
Embrace the unity
of spirit before you.
Heart of the mind,
soul of the self.
Spirit of the body.
Cleanse. Cleanse. Cleanse.
Cleanse. Cleanse!
I warned you, Cynthia. I warned you
someone else would take your place.
Bob! We got a girl
drowned in the pool.
Get her legs. Get
her legs up. Come on.
She's got no breath.
- God!
- How long was she under?
Did you see the police this morning?
They're all over the pool.
Fingerprints. Photographs.
Yeah, next they're gonna have the
fucking Coast Guard out here.
Lot of good that's gonna do Lana.
Ralph! We are gonna start
billing you for those outbursts.
Yeah, you bill us and our family
for every goddamn aspirin!
You bill Lana for a body bag?
Dr. Freeman to gynecology.
Dr. Freeman to gynecology.
[WHISPERINGJ
You are defenseless against him.
Shithead.
Jesus.
You can't blame yourself about Lana.
She was unhappy. And sometimes
unhappy people do stupid things.
She didn't kill herself.
Harris did it.
Harris?
From Unity Fields.
You don't believe me, do you?
I believe that you believe it.
But I also believe
that shooting you up
every time you get the heebie-jeebies
isn't gonna do shit to
solve your real problems.
No. No. We gotta get you out of here.
Get you to someplace nice. Like at
the beach, or in the mountains,
where you can fight your
demons in your own way, right?
I don't know anybody.
I don't have any money.
You know me. Listen,
I was on the staff of a
national publication, and some people
called it a rag but it was home to me.
Me Magazine, you've heard of it!
- I was in a coma.
- Oh, right.
Well, when they carried me off to this
funny farm, Saul- He's the editor- He
told me "You're
welcome back any time,"
so maybe this is the time. Look, look.
I could go to him.
I could tell him your
story. He would give
me a huge advance.
I'd share it with you, we'd be set!
- I don't know.
- No, wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Let me be honest
with you, okay?
This is a good story.
It's a great story, and it could mean
a second chance for me, so ok! Ok!
There is a little bit of self interest
here, alright?
But look! I really think
you should tell people
about Unity Fields.
How they take decent ideas and dreams,
and turn them into something sick and
poisonous. You owe it to the world.
You owe it to yourself, now
you have to ask yourself.
This is my life. Do I want
to live, or do I want to die?
- I want to live.
- Okay! We're in business.
I think I know a way
to make a phone call.
We'll get you out
of here tonight.
Cynthia, this is
the right thing to do.
Of course it is. You said so.
- Yes. I did.
- Yes.
Dr. Hillman, please call your office.
Uh-oh. Get out
your hall pass.
Ladies. Nice to see you
socializing, Cynthia.
Yes. I'll see you later.
Thank you.
No. Thank you.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.
Good.
No!
Miriam!
Miriam!
Stop! Miriam.
He wants us all with him.
He wants us with him and whether
we like it or not we're going.
Cynthia, we're all upset
about what happened.
Harris promised us eternal bliss
on the other side when we got there.
- Eternal bliss.
- Eternal bullshit.
Miriam was gonna write
a story about me.
He killed her because she was
gonna help me get out of here.
First off, Miriam was here
because of an attempted suicide.
Several attempts, and Harris
hasn't got anything to do with it.
You're not listening to me.
You are all gonna die.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
If I die, does my mom get a refund?
- Morning, Dr. B.
- Morning.
- Hey, here he is.
- Dr. Berrisford!
Dr. Berrisford, how are
these suicides related?
- Was it a double suicide?
- No, no, no.
- These were tragic coincidences.
- But why did they kill themselves?
In borderline personality
disorders there is
a predisposition to
suicidal tendencies.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
- What about the commune girl?
- Was it a mass suicide?
- Could she have killed them?
- Could it have been murder?
You're in pain, Cynthia.
Your pain is my pain.
We share it all.
Because we have our love.
And our love will never die.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, you know me at feeding time.
Don't make me take another friend.
Keep your promise, lovechild.
Join us.
No!
I didn't want you to be alone.
Looks like I was right.
We're so pathetic,
rutting like rabbits.
I'm only doing it
because in the morning
I can enjoy hating myself.
I'm only too glad to help.
They'll be doing a bed check soon.
I know a better place.
I know I've said this
before, but I'm gonna
say it again, and I'm
gonna keep saying it
until you believe it.
You're not responsible for what
happened to Lana and Miriam.
And until you believe it, there's
nothing I can do for you.
I'm lost, and confused, and
concerned, and not just as a doctor.
What am I supposed to do,
write you a prescription?
Oh, no!
You can't run away from this, Cynthia.
It's a filthy habit, Ed.
Disgusting.
What now?
- Looks like they went out again.
- Ok, excitement's over.
Why is it so difficult to keep
the lights on around here?
Oh-h-h-h.
Mrs. Robertson, what are you doing up?
Here, put your hand
up against the wall.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
It's just fine.
It's just overloaded circuits. Please,
everyone! Go back to your rooms.
Upstairs?
Alright, alright.
There's something stuck
in the turbine, I'll have
it straight in just a minute.
Well, hurry.
It's just the lights went out.
Take a deep breath.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Connie?
Fuck.
Cynthia.
- We 're up here, Cynthia.
- Join us.
We love you.
What the hell?
We 're up here.
Keep following us. We love you.
Cynthia.
Join us.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Cynthia.
Where are Connie and Ed?
- Cynthia?
- Where are Connie and Ed?
They're with us now.
Where are Connie and Ed?
What the fuck is going on here?!
We're not sure exactly.
We think they were drinking
and they fell into the...
Main turbines.
Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.
Is that supposed to be an explanation?
Huh, Dr. Dick? Ed drank
lots of times. He did.
As a matter of fact,
we used to share a bottle
up on the terrace
when you were at your
Save-the-Whale Meetings.
Oh, but he never wanted to jump
in the goddamn Mixmaster, man.
There's something going on here.
Not something. Someone. Him.
Gilda, would you can it with
your goddamn cosmic god shit?
- He has the power. He calls us.
- I'm getting the fuck out of here.
Who're you?
Lieutenant Wasserman, assigned to you-
Yeah, yeah, shut up,
I get the picture.
Try not to shoot me
or your fat ass.
Ralph.
I have to leave.
Y'know, I thought you might need some
company tonight. It's
safest here, really.
The police are here.
I'm here. We're gonna have
a nice, boring evening tonight.
I even brought provisions.
Pure, unadulterated junk food. At this
point, who cares about chemicals?
Right? Have you tried these?
Ever tried those? They
don't serve these here
Hey, dick? Try harder next time.
Connie and Ed aren't
going to be the last.
Yes, they are.
Everyone's protected,
nothing can happen.
- Everything ok?
- Yeah, Officer, it's fine, thank you.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I
got on your case earlier.
- Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
- Hell, why not?
You want cream or sugar?
J' Regrets J'
J' I've had a few J'
J' But then again J'
J' Too few to whinge J'
J'ordoJ'
J' What I hope to do J'
J' I saw it through J'
- Ralph.
- Um, hi. How are you?
- Nice night, huh?
- What is it?
I just wanted to let you
know that everything's
going to be ok.
It's going to be alright.
Ralph.
Cynthia?
Ralph?
Dr. Carmen, have you seen Ralph?
I was gonna ask you
the same question, Hettie.
With all this commotion
from the power outage,
he didn't take his six o'clock tranq.
- Shit! He misses two in a row, you-
- Dr. Carmen!
Where in the hell have you been?
Pesco, Ralph. He's knocked
out his bodyguard.
There's a trail of blood
all the way down the hall.
He's got Cynthia!
This is Freddy! We need backup, now.
And away we go!
I... I think that we
should go back upstairs
And we should talk to Doctor-
Ah!
I'm sorry. You're
really making me nervous.
And I don't like it.
That was a little joke.
What are you laughing at?
Relax! Come on!
Ralph, don't. I don't think
that we should go out there.
- I have to talk to you!
- I want to go back upstairs.
It's very important!
It's very, very important!
Very, very. Very. Very,
very, very, very important!
It's very important
that I talk to you!
Ralph, I don't think that
you're being yourself.
Ha! Not myself? Not myself?!
Who the fuck else am I supposed to be?
How are we gonna get
out of here, Ralph?
Ralph.
I come down here a lot.
It helps me unwind.
Shit! Fuck, this always
worked before.
I've gotta calm down. I gotta
calm down. I gotta calm down!
I gotta calm down!
They're in the sub-basement.
We have to take the stairs.
- Ralph's killed the elevator.
- Let's hope he stops there.
What did I want to talk to you about?
Oh right, right, right!
There are only a few
chances in life for real glory,
and most people
fuck it off! Most people-
Most people can't
even find their own noses
on their fat faces!
You want an example?
Alright, how about
every fucking doctor,
every fucking patient
in this entire fucking hospital?
Ralph? Wouldn't you like
to speak with a doctor?
I think you know what
I'm talking about, Cynthia.
No, I don't, I don't.
You don't! Fuckin' the great big
gig in the sky, don't play dumb!
I think you know the word
I'm searching for, Cynthia.
- Cynthia...
- U-N-I-T-Y.
- Cynthia...
- Unity.
Join us, Cynthia! In Unity.
In beautiful Unity.
- In Unity. In the real world. Join us.
- Cynthia...
You belong to us. Forever.
Join us.
- Hey!
- You alright?
- Drop those knives.
- Knives? Knives?
These are not knives, these
are fine surgical instruments.
- Don't make me hurt you.
- No!
You're right. This is madness.
Later.
You alright?
Okay, doctor.
My office, now?
Alex. Alex, help me.
- What could I do?
- Help me, Alex.
What is it that you're
implying, Lieutenant?
Fucking crazy people. Who
knows what they can do?
Do you imagine that she
drowned Lana without getting wet?
You saw Ralph kill himself.
She was there every single time.
She's some kind of goddamn catalyst.
I don't know, but I'm gonna
find out one way or another.
- Police custody is long overdue.
- Police custody.
You didn't think I belonged in the
group from the beginning, did you?
- No, I didn't.
- Don't be hard on yourself, ok?
What?
I needed the group. I needed
to find out where I belonged.
I know. It's with him.
Cynthia, I need you to
come with me now, alright?
Nurse? Let's go.
- Where are you taking her?
- Isolation.
Isolation?
The girl needs human
contact, connection.
Isolation's the worst place
in the world for her.
Well, the alternative
is police custody.
No, the alternative is a court order.
There's not a judge in the-
You want this. You
want her on the edge.
You've wanted it since the beginning!
Alex, I know you're fond of
this girl but you are out of line.
You want to see
your theory played out.
Shh. Alex.
Goodbye. Thanks for trying,
but it's time for me to go now.
Okay, honey. Now you just relax.
We're just gonna take you someplace.
Did you hear that? You're
killing her with your theories.
Alex, this has nothing to do
with theories. Look at her.
Can't you understand and see
she's estranged from herself?
Wouldn't matter if she
was in the Mojave
Desert or the middle of New York City.
She's without will.
There's plenty of
room for yours, right?
Now this has got to stop. I'll release
her into police custody
if I can stay on
as her physician.
It's alright with me.
Alex, your tenure with
the clinic is over.
You can't do that!
You want to walk on
your own? Follow me.
- Would you like to come in?
- No, thank you.
I'm sorry. I understand where I am.
What are you saying? No. No.
But why?
- Why me?
- Because you are special, lovechild.
Don't you remember why?
- No.
- It will come to you in time.
Meanwhile, I will come to you.
Everything all right in here, honey?
Yes. It's going to be
beautiful. Very soon.
I am not for this world. But you are.
You can be. Defy the other world.
Look to your heart.
Hey! Better release some hidden
aggression. Feel better? No?
Yes?
Maybe?
Officer, I'll write myself a
prescription in the morning.
I knew you'd come.
But you're too late.
I warned her. I told her
what she had to do.
You won't get to her.
You won't get me.
You don't like the way I drive,
Doctor Addictive Buttface?
Then stay out of the parking lot!
Touchdown!
Oh.
I'm exerting my will, Doctor.
- Are you ready for Unity?
- I'm so tired.
Can't you just kill me?
No, my lovechild.
You must do it yourself.
- Carmen. You look like shit.
- Yes, listen. I need, um...
The scripts for the therapy group.
Forget about it, man. I can't do that.
That's Berrisford's show.
He'd kill me if I did that.
- This is it, isn't it?
- It's the second drawer in the back.
Hey, have you seen that new nurse
in Psychiatric? She's
unbelievable, man.
I'm telling you, I'm thinking
about having myself committed.
Just so I can get close to her. She's
got the most unbelievable legs.
No, this- this is the standard stuff.
Of course it's the standard stuff.
What'd you expect, nuclear secrets?
You fill these prescriptions?
No, Berrisford does
it himself every day.
Comes in in the
morning, sets up the
medication for the day
and Hettie takes it
when she needs it.
Yeah, well I need it now.
What the fuck are you doin', man?
What're you doing? You
out of your mind?
- Have you lost your mind completely?
- Read this. Pesco, Ralph.
Pesco is dead!
- Just help me read it! What is it?
- Alright, just calm down!
Lithium, four times a day.
- Is this Lithium?
- No. No, this is Berynthine.
This is the exact opposite of Lithium.
You give this to a normal
person, he'd flip out.
Someone like Pesco,
you can forget about it.
Listen, what is this,
and this, and this?
Just move. I'll tell
you everything, alright?
Ok, these are dextroamphetamines.
You take one of these,
you walk on the ceiling.
This is methylphenidate.
You take this,
you spend the rest of your
life talkin' to vegetables.
This is Clonadine Chlorpromazine.
Cocamine? They don't
even make this anymore.
Two of these, Mother
Theresa becomes a maniac.
These, uh, I don't even
know what this is.
I've never seen anything like this,
not even on the streets! And this?
And this? This is THC.
Tetrohydrocannabinol.
Know what this is? It's liquified,
condensed marijuana.
Totally synthesized.
100 cc's of this, everybody
in Detroit gets wasted!
No!
Hey Carmen! Who's gonna
clean all this shit up?
Dr. Carmen, what are you doing
here? I thought Berrisford-
He did! Hettie, where's Cynthia?
- Isolation!
- I know that! But where, which one?
In the B wing! What's
gotten into you?
Berrisford! He's killed 'em!
Call Wasserman!
These damn doctors are
crazier than the patients.
Give me the police. Stat!
- Cynthia, please. Let me see her.
- You're not supposed to be here!
Get out of my way!
Where is she?
Cynthia!
Get outta here. I'm
waiting for Harris.
- There is no Harris.
- You don't understand.
I do understand. Cynthia, I
can't come back, and I need
you to understand something.
Can you do that, please?
To prove a theory, Berrisford
secretly changed
the medication for
everybody in the group.
These drugs are what
drove everybody to suicide.
It's not Unity Fields.
It's not Harris!
It's not you. Do you
understand? Berrisford's
responsible and he's
gonna be treating you!
He wants to control
you, just like Harris!
He can't prove his
theory unless you want
to kill yourself! Do you understand?
He wants you to kill yourself!
You're wrong. He comes
to me. He speaks to me.
There he is now. Jesus, Cynthia, fight
the drugs. Fight the
drugs he gave you!
Did you kill him?
- No, no.
- Oh. Then he won't be coming with us?
Oh, no.
Not where we're going, lovechild.
Here, take my hand. Come on.
Oh, shit!
[CLAlvloRING1
Cynthia? Cynthia?
Cynthia!
Dr. Carmen!
Where's Dr. Carmen?
- Do you see them, Cynthia?
- Yes.
Yes, I see them.
What do you want to do, Cynthia?
What do you want to do?
No!
- Cynthia.
- It's your decision, Cynthia.
It's your choice.
Cynthia.
Choose, Cynthia.
Decide.
Act!
It's so beautiful.
No!
You mustn't be afraid.
Come to me now.
You're mine forever,
lovechild. Unity.
One spirit. One will.
It's time, Cynthia. Now.
Cynthia. Cynthia. Cynthia!
Open your eyes!
Cynthia. Cynthia!
Open your eyes.
Cynthia. Cynthia, wake up.
Cynthia, wake up!
You've gotta help me now!
Pull yourself up! Help me!
All that matters is our love at Unity.
No.
- There's nothing for me here.
- I'm here for you, you stay for me!
- Come on and pull yourself up!
- Cynthia, what do you see?
- Eternal bliss!
- Eternal bliss.
Who's there, Cynthia? Who's
waiting for you? Friends.
No! Don't listen to him.
They didn't care about you. They
didn't love you. I love you!
I'll go with you but
I won't let you go!
Look at him. Look at him!
It's Berrisford! Come on, Cynthia.
Look at him. Look!
Look at him! Now help me.
I can't do it alone, you help me!
Pull yourself up!
Try! That's it. Come on.
Come on! A little more.
Come on!
Alex, let her go.
She's made her choice.
You can't bring her back.
It's a futile, empty gesture.
- Fuck you.
- That's the wrong answer, Alex.
No!
Alright, what the hell's going
on up here? Come on!
How in the hell did
they get down there?
Lieutenant, I'm glad you're here.
Alex was caught red-handed.
I came to look for Cynthia, I
found him trying to push her
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean he's been-
Yes! Yes, he's
the one, he orchestrated this, raised
the medication, he to whom I passed on
the torch. He arranged
the whole thing, he
arranged the switched
medicines, he used
these people for experiments.
No! No. He's responsible. He did
this. My hand. He did everything.
- Jesus, he tried to kill us!
- Oh, Alex, Alex, Alex.
Don't do it!
Do it.
Wrong again, Alex.
No!
It's alright. It's alright.
It was Berrisford.
There is no Harris.
There's nothing there!
There's nothing to
be scared of. Alright?
You don't have to be afraid.
You don't have to be afraid anymore.
