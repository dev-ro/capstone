On Monday morning,
a patient named Guernsey...
male, middle 70s, was admitted
to the h ospital complaining of chest pains.
He had been referred by a n ursing h ome...
where the doctor had
diagn osed his condition as Angina pectoris.
It is axiomatic...
that n ursing-h ome doctors
are always wrong.
The intern wh o admitted
Mr. Guernsey, h o wever...
accep ted the diagn osis
and prescribed m orphine...
a drug suitable for angina,
b ut n o t at all suitable for emphysema...
which is un fortunately
what the old man actually had.
Within an h o ur, the patient
became unresp onsive and diaph oretic...
and was raced up to In tensive Care,
with an irreg ular p ulse o f 1 50...
blo od pressure 90 o ver 60,
respiration rapid and shallo w.
The residen t on duty in In tensive Care
comp o unded the blunder...
by treating the old man
for p ulm onary edema.
He gave him digitalis, diuretics and oxygen.
This restored the old man 's color.
He was sen t to his ro om
in the Holly Pavilion...
ruddy-complected and peacefully asleep.
But the patien t was in CO 2 narcosis,
and died at 7 : 30 that evening.
I men tion all this only to explain
h o w the bed in Ro om 806 became available.
The in tern in volved
was a prickly yo ung b uck named Schaefer...
wh o had a go od thing going for him
with a technician in the Hematology Lab.
In the haphazard fashion
of h ospital romances...
Dr. Schaefer had been zapping this girl...
on wheelchairs, stretchers, pantry shelves...
in the kitchen, in the m org ue,
in the dark corners o f corridors...
standing up, sitting do wn....
So yo u can imagine
what an available bed mean t to him.
S h e i I a, t h i s i s H oward.
I g ot a bed fo r u s fo r to n i g ht.
A real, h on est-to-G od bed.
Dr. S ch aefer....
Di d you kn ow th at Dr. S ch aefer
was i n Room 806 becau se h e' s dead?
What?
I ' m j ust tel I i ng you that Dr. Schaefer is dead.
-What do you want, Perez?
- I don't know what th is is about...
but Dr. Schaefer is i n Room 806
with an lV ru n n i ng, and he's dead.
-I d id n't even know he was sick.
-What the hel I are you tal ki ng about?
-Do you know what she's tal ki ng about?
-No.
Maybe l' m goi ng crazy. I don't know.
Isn't Room 806 the patient G uernsey?
Did someth i ng happen
that maybe I d id n't know about?
I don't know what you' re tal ki ng about.
Th is is the n uttiest th i ng I ever saw.
Dr. Schaefer is i n Room 806, dead.
What Dr. Schaefer? Ou r Dr. Schaefer?
Ou r Dr. Schaefer. The one
who's always g rabbi ng everybody's ass.
-Do you know what she's tal ki ng about?
-No.
I don't know what you' re tal ki ng about.
What do you mean,
" Dr. Schaefer's i n Room 806, dead"?
I mean, he's lyi ng on the far bed,
stone dead, and with an lV.
If you don't bel ieve me,
you oug ht to go and look for you rself.
Maybe you'd better cal I M rs. Ch ristie.
Dr. Bock.
Y es, M rs. Ch ristie, what is it?
It's al I rig ht. I'd have to be getti ng u p
any m i n ute, anyway.
Sorry, I m issed that.
Wou ld you say it agai n, please?
I know.
Schaefer, the stud with the g lasses,
fancies al I the n u rses.
I' m afraid I don't u nderstand.
What do you mean?
Was he sick?
I mean....
What was the cause of death?
Was he bei ng treated? I don't u nderstand.
What was he doi ng i n the bed?
You d id say....
M rs. Ch ristie, d id you cal I the office?
Good, l' I l....
It's al I rig ht.
I'd be getti ng my wake-u p cal l
any m i n ute, anyway.
People!
What do you say, S u ndstrom?
How long do you th i n k you r monopol istic,
excl usionary, racist pol icies wi I l work?
Free the hope!
Now, hold it.
Herb! I' m g lad I caug ht u p with you.
How's it goi ng?
One of my i nterns
d ropped dead th is morn i ng.
Real ly? I' m sorry to hear that.
I u nderstand you moved out to a hotel.
-Th i ngs got that bad with Phyl I is?
-It's been that bad for 24 years.
You gon na be sol icitous?
God.
I' m the g uy
that broug ht you i nto th is hospital...
so I th i n k I can ski p
the d i plomatic overtu res.
Marty stopped me
i n the hal I yesterday, very u pset.
He had j ust had I u nch with you.
He said you sou nded su icidal.
Marty tends to be extravagant,
but he's not the on ly one.
Jack S i nger mentioned
that you were boozi ng it u p a lot.
Let's face it, you have been sloug h i ng off.
I u nderstand
you haven't even been doi ng rou nds.
I' m goi ng to do rou nds today.
Do you want to take a cou ple of days off?
Go down to Montego Bay,
get d ru n k, get laid, get a I ittle su n?
For God's sake, l' m 53 years old,
with al I the attendant fears.
I j ust left my wife, after 24 years.
A standard case of menopausal melancholy.
-Maybe you wan na see Ei n horn.
-Don't wan na see a psych iatrist, don't worry.
If I j ust get to work, l' I l be fi ne.
I' m sorry if I caused you concern.
S id cal led from St. Lu ke's.
He said the demonstrators there...
-are plan n i ng a march to joi n those here.
-God.
-Did you cal I the cops?
-S u re.
-They' re al I i n 806, Doctor.
-What happened?
I th i n k l' I l j ust let M rs. Ch ristie
tel I you about it.
Oh, boy, what happened?
I've seen some pretty good snafus.
But th is one....
There's a certai n splendor to th is one.
One of the n ig ht n u rses
thoug ht he was a patient...
and pl ugged an lV i nto h i m.
He was a d iabetic.
What do you mean
she pl ugged an lV i nto h i m?
It's a real ly screwed-u p story.
We had an old man i n there
who d ied last n ig ht.
So the bed was avai lable.
You know Schaefer. He's Sam my Stud.
He tal ked a n u rse
i nto zappi ng h i m on the bed?
A g i rl from Hematology
he's been ru n n i ng arou nd with.
-God, it's a Roman farce!
-I thoug ht I heard you out here.
I suggest you do that rig ht now.
I' m so terri bly sorry.
As I u nderstand it...
a n u rse i nadvertently ad m i n istered an lV
to Schaefer. How cou ld that happen?
-We oug ht to straig hten th is out elsewhere.
-Very good idea.
Oh, God, what a mess!
-These th i ngs happen.
-I'd better cal I the Med ical Exam i ner.
-I sti I l don't u nderstand what happened.
-lt took us an hou r to get it sorted out.
A patient named G uernsey
d ied last n ig ht, i n 806.
That i nformation wasn't g iven
to the n ig ht n u rses. These th i ngs happen.
At any rate, accord i ng to the cardex...
the patient, G uernsey, was down
for 25 mg of S pari ne at q. 6h.
M rs. Reardon sent N u rse Perez
to g ive h i m h is 1 2:00 shot.
I n the meanti me, Dr. Schaefer
usu rped that particu lar bed...
for h is own pu rposes.
Dr. Bru baker suggests
it was for a love tryst...
and some weig ht is g iven that hypothesis...
-by the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked.
-I get the d rift.
N u rse Perez went i n
and sedated Dr. Schaefer...
th i n ki ng it was the patient G uernsey.
What I don't u nderstand--
May I fi n ish, please?
After Perez gave h i m h is shot, she noticed
the lV was pi nched off on the bed.
S he reported th is to M rs. Reardon...
who then assig ned N u rse Rivers
to restart the lV.
Rivers was a float. S he d id n't even know
the staff people on the floor.
Nobody knew what the patient looked I i ke,
si nce he'd on ly been ad m itted that morn i ng.
-So she pl ugged an lV i nto h i m.
-Y es.
-How m uch?
-A I iter.
Five percent g I ucose sol ution
won't ki I l anybody.
Was he dehyd rated?
Did he have any anci I lary cond itions?
Did n't anybody bother to go check on h i m
d u ri ng the n ig ht?
Even u nder the i m pression
that he was merely a patient?
Was he hyperosmolar?
Did he have a bad heart?
He m ust have had some sort of th rom bosis.
I want the post done here, M r. H itchcock.
You and I better have a chat
about you r excessive use of float n u rses.
I've got nearly a thousand n u rses
i n th is hospital--
Every ti me one of them has her period,
she d isappears for th ree days.
Doctors com plai n they can't fi nd
the same n u rse on the same floor...
two days i n a row.
What am I gon na tel I Schaefer's parents?
That a su bstitute n u rse assassi nated h i m...
as she cou ld n't tel I the doctors
from the patients on the floor?
My God!
The i ncom petence here
is absol utely rad iant!
Two n u rses wal k i nto a room
and stick need les i n a man...
and one of those is a N u m ber 1 8 Jelco,

with ad hesive tape...
and it's the wrong poor son of a bitch!
Where do you trai n you r n u rses,

-Wi I l there be anyth i ng else?
-No.
Before you cal I the fam i ly,
I wish you'd speak to M r. Mead about th is.
We'd I i ke, natu ral ly, to avoid I itigation.

Dr. Esterhazy wants to start h i ri ng
tem porary people...
to cover the su m mer vacations.
He says, last year,
some of the replacement people...

He wonders if you cou ld do someth i ng
about getti ng these people paid prom ptly.
Ms. Aron ivici com plai ns the lab reports

As you know...
we've ag reed to take over

I don't know why th is was d u m ped

Fi nd out if Dr. Ei n horn is i n h is office.
Wh ich Dr. Ei n horn?
-Ophthal mology or Psych iatry?
-Psych iatry. Never m i nd. I' I l look i n, myself.
Is he i n?
-Can I have a m i n ute, Joe?
-Of cou rse.
I've been havi ng periods
of acute depression, recently.
Apparently, it's becom i ng noticeable.
A n u m ber of people have remarked about it.

-Do you want to sit down?
-No. I' m not good at confessional.
What can I tel I you?

I left her a dozen ti mes.

We stayed th roug h a process of attrition.
Obviously, sadomasoch istic dependency.

They let her go.
The typical affl uent American fam i ly.
I don't mean to be faci le about th is.
I blame myself
for those two useless you ng people.
I never exercised parental authority.
I' m no good at that.
Oh, God, l' m no good at th is, either.
Let's j ust forget the whole th i ng.
I' m sorry I bothered you.
How serious are you r su icidal specu lations?

Isn't he the doctor that came i n

Dr. Kish has been d rivi ng me n uts

He's su pposed to see me about that.
Th is is the Emergency Room.
One of the doctors d ied of a heart attack.

-One of ou r doctors j ust d ied.

It's a reportable case, Bru baker.
I'd write it u p.
N u rse...
who's the sen ior resident on th is floor?
That wou ld be Dr. Bru baker.
But he's at Ch ief-of-Service rou nds, now.
That's th is way?
I wonder if there's some correlation between
hepatic tu bercu losis and d rug add iction.
Presu mably, there was an early
consideration of S BE?
Y es, si r. We d iscou nted it
after repeated blood cu ltu res were negative.
-You, Am bler. Is that rig ht, "Am bler"?
-Y es, si r.
What else do you look for

Dr. Bru baker, can I see you

Don't worry about it. There aren't any.

-What was the latex fixation?
-lt wasn't done, si r.
Don't you th i n k that's an i m portant test
to d ifferentiate S BE from m i I iary TB?
Not you, Biegel man. Am bler.
There's about a 70 percent i ncidence
of false-positive latex i n S BE.
You have been read i ng u p.
If the d iag nosis were S BE...
wou ld a positive latex

-We'd expect the latex to become negative.

-Are you applyi ng for you r i nternsh i p here?
-l' m not su re.
Come and see me.
Wou ld you sit u p, please, m iss?
We've got a I ittle th i ng here, Doctor.
The g i rl over there
is the daug hter of the patient i n 806.
He is at the moment comatose,
and req u i res i ntravenous feed i ng and meds.
The daug hter wants to take the father
out of the hospital...
and back to Mexico, where they I ive.
The patient's name is Dru m mond.
He's apparently a Method ist m issionary.
They ru n some ki nd of rel ig ious m ission
among the Apache I nd ians.
The daughter says she's a licensed nurse...
so she can give
the necessary lVs and treatment.
I don't think he should be let out
of the hospital.
The attending,
the guy in brown over there, concurs.
Wait, let me have al I that agai n.
As a matter of fact,
th is is Dr. Biegel man's case.
Never m i nd the professional eth ics.
What happened?
I don't know why l' m coveri ng u p
for that son of a bitch i n Farkis Pavi I ion.
The patient, a man of 56,
was ad m itted to the hospital 1 0 days ago...
i n good health, for a checku p.
No visi ble d istress.
We d id the mandatory worku p on h i m.
Blood cu ltu res, stool, LE preps, chest EKG.
Al I negative. However, there was
some evidence of protei n i n h is u ri ne.
I don't know how that g uy
i n Farkis Pavi I ion fou nd out.
Maybe he had a deal
with one of the g i rls i n the lab.
He tu rned u p the next day...
con ned the patient i nto sig n i ng
an authorization for a biopsy.
-What g uy i n Farkis Pavi I ion?
-Some postg rad fel low named lves.
El roy lves. I never met h i m. He's on
one of the i m m u nology research prog rams.
Some postg rad came u p here,
d id a biopsy on the patient?
Y es, si r. He con ned Biegel man
with that story--
Protei n i n the u ri ne?
-And he biopsied the man?
-And he n icked a vessel.
They woke u p Biegel man at 2:00
i n the morn i ng, as the patient was i n shock.
Biegel man cal led the kid ney people
for a consu lt.
But what was there to see?
The patient was sou r and bleed i ng.
S poke to th is fel low, S utcl iff.
He referred us to a su rgeon named Wel beck.
-That barber?
-You ai n't heard noth i ng yet.
We fi nal ly got Wel beck
arou nd 4:00 i n the morn i ng.
He said go ahead.
So they laid the su rgery for 8:00.
Wel beck tu rned u p half-stoned,
orders an lVP, clears h i m for al lerg ies--
Without actual ly testi ng,
and the patient went i nto shock.
And tu bu lar necrosis.
They lopped out the bleed i ng kid ney...
ran h i m back to the room,
we waited for u ri ne.
Fever began spi ki ng I i ke hel l, u rem ia,
vom iti ng. So we arranged hemod ialysis.
He's putti ng out good water now...
but some n u rse goofed on h is last
treatment. A sh u nt separated, someth i ng.
Blood pressu re pl u nged.
They ran h i m u p to lCU...
gave h i m two u n its of whole blood.
Vital sig ns are normal, but he's comatose.
-That was two days ago.
-I n short...
a man comes i nto th is hospital
i n perfect health...
and i n the space of one week,
we chop out one kid ney...
damage another, red uce h i m to coma,
and dam n near ki I l h i m.
Y es, si r.
You know, Bru baker...
Iast n ig ht I sat i n my hotel room,
reviewi ng the sham bles of my I ife...
and contem plati ng su icide.
I said, " No, Bock, don't do it.
You' re a doctor, you' re a healer.
"You' re the Ch ief of Med ici ne
at one of the g reat hospitals of the world.
"You are a necessary person.
You r I ife is mean i ngfu l."
Then I wal k i n here, today,
and I fi nd out that one of my doctors...
was ki I led by a cou ple of n u rses
who m istook h i m for a patient...
because he screwed a tech n ician
from the Neph rology Lab.
-Hematology--
-Now you come to me...
with th is goth ic horror story i n wh ich
the enti re mach i nery of modern med ici ne...
has apparently conspi red
to destroy one lousy patient.
How am I to sustai n my feel i ng
of mean i ngfu I ness i n the face of th is?
I' I l tel I you someth i ng.
If there were an oven arou nd here,
I'd stick my head i n it.
What was the name
of that g uy from Farkis Pavi I ion, agai n?
Ives, si r. El roy lves.
-Somebody oug ht to ream h is ass.
-l' m goi ng to ream h is ass.
I' m gon na break that Wel beck's back.
I' I l defrock those two can n i bals.
They wi I l never agai n practice
i n th is hospital. I' I l tel I you that.
What about the g i rl? S he says
we have no rig ht to stop her...
from taki ng her father out.
S he's wi I l i ng to sig n an AOR form.
Let h i m go...
before we ki I l h i m.
Get me Dr. G i I ley.
I want to tal k to h i m rig ht now.
Put h i m on page, if you have to.
I don't care if he's operati ng.
You get me some mon key named lves.
I-V-E-S. Fi rst name, El roy.
He's i n the Farkis Pavi I ion.
I want to tal k to you, Joe.
Come i n my office, please.
You got some pu n k rotati ng
i n you r department, named lves?
Also, I want to ask you
what ki nd of d ialysis room you' re ru n n i ng.
Excuse me.
G i I ley? Bock.
Did n't you tel I me a few months ago...
you were gon na cut off al I privi leges
for that assassi n, Wel beck?
Wel beck, yes! He j ust butchered
another one of my patients!
The man's a buccaneer.
I want h i m broug ht u p
before the Med ical Executive Com m ittee.
He's i n you r department, not m i ne.
He's putatively a su rgeon!
I' I l be here.
I th i n k you shou ld know
you've got some research g uy named lves...
i n you r department
who's doi ng some d u bious biopsies.
We' re havi ng enoug h problems
squeezing grants...
-out of the Nixon Administration--
-lves is dead. That's why l' m here.
-What do you mean?
-I mean he's dead.
He had a heart attack
i n the Emergency Room.
He had a heart attack
i n the Emergency Room?
What is th is? Some ki nd of plag ue?
Where is he now?
They were j ust taki ng h i m
down to Pathology.
...the next th i ng anybody knew,
th ree hou rs later...
M rs. Cush i ng said there was a dead man
i n the hold i ng room.
You don't fi nd anyth i ng
a I ittle g rotesq ue about al I th is?
-What do you mean?
-I mean, at 8: 30 th is morn i ng...
we meet over a doctor
who's ki I led i ntravenously...
and here we are fou r hou rs later,
with another doctor...
who's d ied of a heart attack
i n the Emergency Room.
What are you suggesti ng?
You th i n k we have a mad ki I ler
stal ki ng the hospital hal ls?
Presu mably, Dr. Ives d ied of a heart attack,
and Schaefer i n a d iabetic coma.
People do d ie of these th i ngs.
It's al I coi ncidental,
but I wou ld n't cal I it g rotesq ue.
How long are they gon na be
on Schaefer's post?
-I don't th i n k you'd I i ke to cal I next-of-ki n?
-No, than ks.
God, I need a d ri n k.
M r. Mead?
I have an i njection for you.
What the hel I is goi ng on i n there?
Honey, we got a witch doctor i n 806...
and you better go i n there.
You know that I nd ian that was sitti ng
i n 806 al I n ig ht? He's sti I l there.
And the g i rl's there,
and they' re doi ng some voodoo i n there.
-And I ai n't kidd i ng!
-What' re you tal ki ng about?
I mean that I nd ian's i n there,
half-naked, goi ng...
...with a I ittle bag.
You j ust better get i n there, M rs. Du n ne.
You wan na see someth i ng, baby?
You j ust come here.
It's a perfectly harm less ceremony.
It's noth i ng to get excited about.
It' I l be over i n a few m i n utes, anyway.
M r. Blacktree is a shaman
who gets h is power from the th u nder...
and it's i m perative he concl ude h is ritual
wh i le the storm is sti I l goi ng on.
Visiti ng hou rs were over at 9:00.
Al I that's goi ng on i n there
is a si m ple Apache prayer...
for my father's recovery.
The marki ngs he's made
on my father's arms...
are from the pol len of the tu le plant.
The twigs have no sig n ificance,
except they've been struck by I ig htn i ng...
and are conseq uently appeals
to the spi rit of I ig htn i ng.
It's al I enti rely harm less.
A rel ig ious ceremony, not a med ical one.
You don't seriously bel ieve
al I that m u m bo j u m bo's gon na cu re h i m?
On the other hand, it won't ki I l h i m.
-Okay. Go ahead.
-Than ks.
-You sti I l gon na take you r father out?
-I have to arrange an am bu lance.
-ls there a phone here I cou ld use?
-Use my office.
Than k you.
Hel lo. I'd I i ke to arrange an am bu lance.
I'd I i ke to arrange an am bu lance
at 1 : 30, tomorrow afternoon.
Dru m mond. Fi rst name, Barbara.
I' I l pay cash.
You' re to pick u p my father,
Dru m mond, Edward...
at the Man hattan Med ical Center,
Hol ly Pavi I ion, Room 806.
It's a stretcher case.
I presu me you provide the stretcher.
He's to be taken to American Ai rl i nes...
Ken nedy Ai rport,
Fl ig ht 729 to Y u ma, Arizona.
I' I l accom pany the patient. Than k you.
-You bel ieve i n witchcraft, M iss Dru m mond?
-I bel ieve i n everyth i ng.
-You I i ke a d ri n k?
-Y eah.
My father, you shou ld know,
was a very successfu I doctor i n Boston.
A mem ber of the Harvard Med ical Facu lty.
He was a widower, and I was h is on ly ch i ld.
He was not an especial ly rel ig ious man,
a sober Method ist.
One even i ng, seven years ago...
he attended a Pentecostal meeti ng
at Harvard...
and fou nd h i mself speaki ng i n tong ues.
He san k to h is knees at the back of the room
and began to tal k fl uently...
i n a lang uage wh ich no one
had ever heard before.
Th is sort of th i ng happens freq uently
at Pentecostal meeti ngs...
and began happen i ng reg u larly to my father.
It was not u n usual to wal k i nto ou r home
and fi nd my father sitti ng i n h is office...
utterly serene, happi ly speaki ng to the ai r
i n th is strange, foreig n tong ue.
I was, at that ti me, 20 years old...
havi ng my obl igatory affai r
with a m i nority g rou p.
I n my case, a Hopi I nd ian,
a postg rad uate fel low at Harvard...
doi ng h is doctorate i n aborig i nal lang uages
of the Southwest.
One day, I broug ht the I nd ian boy home...
j ust as my father was si n ki ng to h is knees
i n the entrance foyer i n one of h is trances.
The I nd ian wheeled i n h is tracks,
and he said, " l' I l be a son of a bitch! "
You see, my father
was speaki ng an Apache d ialect...
an obscu re d ialect, at that...
spoken on ly by a ragged band
of u n reconstructed I nd ians...
who had rejected the reservation,
and gone to I ive i n isolation...
i n the S ierra Mad re Mou ntai ns
i n Northern Mexico.
What do you say to that?
What the hel I am I su pposed to say to that?
I' m sitti ng here boozi ng,
and you come i n and tel I me...
some demented story
about you r father's rel ig ious conversion.
You m iss the poi nt.
Not my father's conversion, m i ne.
You see, I'd been h itti ng the acid
pretty reg u larly at that ti me.
I had ach ieved a few m i nor sensory
deform ities, some su icidal despai rs...
but noth i ng as wi ld
as fl uency i n an obscu re Apache d ialect.
I mean, I i ke, "Wow, man! "
Here was I ivi ng afflatus
rig ht before my eyes!
With i n a week, my father had closed
h is Beacon H i I l practice...
and set out to start a m ission
i n the Mexican Mou ntai ns.
I tu rned i n my S DS card
and my crash hel met, and I fol lowed h i m.
It was a d isaster, at least for me.
My father had received the revelation, not l.
He stood gau nt on a mou ntai n slope
and preached the Apocalypse...
to solem n ly am used I nd ians.
I mastu rbated a lot.
We I ived i n a g rass wicki u p...
ate raw rabbit and crushed pi ñon n uts.
It was h ideous.
With i n two months, I was back i n Boston.
A hol low shel l, d isenchanted
with everyth i ng, and d izzy with deng ue.
I tu rned to austerity, com bed my hai r
tig ht, entered n u rsi ng school.
I became haggard, d riven...
had shamelessly i ncestuous d reams
about my father.
I took u p with some of the sen ior staff there.
One of them...
a portly psych iatrist, explai ned...
I was generated
by an u n resolved I ust for my father.
I cracked u p.
One day, they fou nd me wal ki ng to work
naked and scream i ng obscen ities.
There was tal k of i nstitutional izi ng me.
So I packed a bag and went back to joi n
my father i n the S ierra Mad re Mou ntai ns.
I've been there ever si nce.
That's th ree years.
My father is, of cou rse, as mad as a hatter.
I watch over h i m,
and have been cu riously content.
You see, I bel ieve i n everyth i ng.
What was that al I about?
I thoug ht I was obvious as hel l.
I' m tryi ng to tel I you,
I have a th i ng about m idd le-aged men.
I ad m i re you r candor.
You've been ad m i ri ng a lot more than that.
You' re wasti ng you r ti me.
I've been i m potent for years.
Ru bbish.
What the hel I is wrong with bei ng i m potent?
Kids are more h u ng u p on sex
than the Victorians.
I got a son, 23 years old.
I th rew h i m out of the house last year.
Pietistic I ittle h u m bug.
He preached u n iversal love,
and he despised everyone.
Had a blan ket contem pt for the m idd le class,
even its decencies.
Detested my mother
because she had a petit bou rgeois pride...
i n her son, the doctor.
I can not tel I you how brutish ly
he ig nored that rather good lady.
When she d ied,
he d id n't even come to the fu neral.
He felt the chapel service was an hypocrisy.
He told me h is generation
d id n't I ive with I ies.
I said, " Listen, everybody I ives with I ies."
I g rabbed h i m by h is poncho...
and I d ragged h i m the length...
of ou r seven-room, despicably affl uent...
m idd le-class apartment,
and I fl u ng h i m...out.
I haven't seen h i m si nce.
You know what he said to me?
He's stand i ng there on the land i ng,
on the verge of tears.
He sh rieked at me:
"You old fi n k.
"You can't even get it u p anymore."
That was it, you see.
That was h is real revol ution.
It wasn't racism...
the oppressed poor, or the war i n Vietnam.
The u lti mate American societal sickness...
was a I i m p d i ng us.
My God.
If there is a despised,
m isu nderstood m i nority i n th is cou ntry...
it is us poor, i m potent bastards.
I' m i m potent, and l' m proud of it.
I m potence is beautifu l, baby!
-Power to the i m potent! Rig ht on, baby!
-Rig ht on!
You know...
when I say i m potent,
I don't mean merely I i m p.
Disag reeable as it may be for a woman,
a man may I ust for other th i ngs...
someth i ng a I ittle less transient
than an erection.
A sense of permanent worth.
That's what med ici ne was to me,
my reason for bei ng.
When I was 34...
I presented a paper
before the an n ual convention...
of the Society of Cl i n ical I nvestigation...
that pioneered
the whole goddam n field of I m m u nology.
A breakth roug h.
I' m i n al I the textbooks.
I happen to be an em i nent man.
You know someth i ng else?
I don't g ive a goddam n.
When I say i m potent...
I mean I've lost even my desi re to work.
That's a hel I of a lot
more pri mal passion than sex.
I've lost my reason for bei ng.
My pu rpose.
The on ly th i ng I ever tru ly loved.
It is al I ru bbish, isn't it?
T ransplants, anti bod ies....
We man ufactu re genes.
We can prod uce bi rth ectogenetical ly.
We can practical ly clone people
I i ke carrots...
and half the kids i n th is g hetto
haven't even been i nocu lated for pol io!
We have establ ished the most enormous...
med ical entity ever conceived...
and people are sicker than ever!
We cu re noth i ng!
We heal noth i ng!
The whole goddam n wretched world...
is strang u lati ng i n front of ou r eyes.
That's what I mean when I say i m potent.
You don't know
what the hel I l' m tal ki ng about, do you?
Of cou rse I do.
I' m very ti red.
And I h u rt.
I've got noth i ng goi ng for me anymore.
Can you u nderstand that?
Of cou rse.
Can you also u nderstand...
that the on ly ad m issi ble matter left is death?
Sou nds to me I i ke a fam i I iar case
of morbid menopause.
Ch rist.
It's hard for me
to take you r despai r seriously.
-You obviously enjoy it so m uch.
-Bugger off!
That's al I l need now, is cl i n ical i nsig ht.
Some cockamam ie 25-year-old acid head...
is gon na reassu re me
about the menopause now!
I'd I i ke to be alone.
Why don't you j ust beat it?
Close the door and tu rn off the I ig hts
on you r way out.
M r. Blacktree d isapproves of my m i n iski rt...
but it was the on ly th i ng I had
to come to the city with.
Back at the tri be,
I wear an kle-length buckski n.
Swel l. Close the door and tu rn off the I ig hts.
What' re you shooti ng?
Leave me alone.
Potassi u m.
You take enoug h of th is stuff, it' I l ki I l you.
I thoug ht I m ig ht have read you wrong, that
you real ly were su icidal, so I came back.
Who asked you?
Leave me alone!
Why can't you leave me alone?
Leave me alone.
Why d id n't you let me do it?
I' I l see you.
Do you have a match, Doctor?
You wou ld n't be awake?
-What ti me is it?
-Al most 7:00.
I swi ped th is for you
out of the n u rses' locker room.
I' I l make good on you r d ress.
I' m afraid it was torn beyond repai r.
I' I l buy you a new one, or g ive me the size
and l' I l send it on to you.
I wan na tal k to you about that.
-T al k to me about what?
-You r father.
You real ly shou ld n't take h i m out of here
i n h is cond ition.
I've j ust been looki ng at h is chart.
There's no reason to presu me brai n damage.
You can't pred ict anyth i ng
i n these i nstances...
but he cou ld come out of that coma
at any ti me.
I th i n k you shou ld leave h i m here.
I' I l personal ly look after h i m.
Is th is you r way of sayi ng you'd I i ke me
to stay i n town a few more days?
That wou ld be n ice, too.
What do you say, M iss Dru m mond?
I expect you can cal I me Barbara...
consideri ng you ravished me
th ree ti mes last n ig ht.
-Th ree ti mes?
-Look at h i m pretend i ng he d id n't cou nt.
You were as puffed u p as a toad about it.
Pu nched a cou ple of holes i n you r crusade
for u n iversal i m potence, d id n't it?
I th i n k we' re on fi rst-name basis now.
I' I l cal I you Herb.
Let's g ive you r father a week, Barbara.
What do you say?
I don't want my father i n th is hospital.
I had a d ream about th is hospital.
I d reamt th is enormous...
starched, wh ite-ti le bu i ld i ng
sudden ly eru pted I i ke a volcano...
and al I the patients, doctors, n u rses,
attendants, orderl ies...
the whole I i ne-staff, food-service people,
the aged, the lame...
and you, rig ht i n the m idd le...
were stam ped i ng i n one h ideous,
scream i ng, su icidal mass i nto the sea.
I' m taki ng my father out of here,
and as q u ickly as I can.
You' re real ly a fru itcake, you know?
Let me put it th is way. I love you.
I fancied you from the moment you came
I u m beri ng down that hal lway, u pstai rs.
I said to M r. Blacktree,
"Who's that h u I ki ng bear of a man?"
The Apaches are reverential about bears.
Won't eat bear meat, never ski n bears.
Bears are thoug ht of as both ben ig n
and evi l, but very strong power.
Men with bear power are h ig h ly respected
and are said to be g reat healers.
"That man, " I said,
"gets h is power from the bear."
Swel l. Now, look.
You haven't got a hotel room
or some sort of accom modations...
-where you can stay--
-Let me put it th is way.
My father and I accept
the i m placabi I ity of death.
If he d ies, he d ies.
I' m getti ng h i m out of here
and back to Mexico at 1 :00 p. m.
I want you to come with us,
because I love you and want ch i ld ren.
I' m afraid Mexico
is a I ittle too remote for me.
We cou ld use you down there.
There's a cu riously h ig h i ncidence of TB.
You'd be a doctor agai n.
You'd be necessary agai n.
If you love me, I don't see any other choice.
What do you mean, if I love you?
I raped you i n a su icidal rage.
How d id we get to love and ch i ld ren?
I oug ht to know if a man loves me or not.
You m ust've told me half a h u nd red ti mes
last n ig ht you loved me.
You m u rm u red and shouted it.
You even opened the wi ndow
and bel lowed it out i nto the street.
Those were more expressions
of g ratitude than love.
G ratitude for what?
For resu rrecti ng feel i ngs of I ife i n me
I thoug ht dead.
My God, what do you th i n k love is?
Al I rig ht, I love you! You love me!
I' m not about to arg ue
with so relentless a romantic.
S i nce we have th is g reat passion
goi ng for us...
why don't you stay arou nd New Y ork
for a week or 1 0 days?
It's u p to 1 0 days now.
-J ust u nti I you r father's cond ition i m proves.
-No.
I've had these prophetic d reams
for seven n ig hts.
Seven is a si n ister n u m ber.
The mean i ng of these d reams is very clear,
seven ti mes as clear.
I' m to get you and my father out of here
before we' re al I destroyed.
You' re certifiable.
Half the ti me
you' re an i ntel I igent you ng woman...
then al I of a sudden,
you tu rn i nto a Cabal ist...
who bel ieves i n d reams
and witchcraft and bear power.
I don't I i ke the way
you d ism iss my whole I ife as u n necessary.
I do a lot of heal i ng here i n Man hattan.
I don't have to go to Mexico to do it.
I also teach.
I send out 80 doctors a year i nto the world...
often i nspi rited, at least com petent.
I've bu i It u p one of the best departments
of med ici ne i n the world.
We have a hel I of a heart u n it,
we have a hel I of a kid ney g rou p.
A lot of people come i nto th is place
i n big trou ble...
and go out a lot better for the experience,
so don't tel I me how u n necessary I am.
So why were you tryi ng to ki I l you rself
with an overdose of potassi u m?
-Where are you goi ng?
-My hotel. I have to check out.
M r. Blacktree doesn't speak any Eng I ish.
-You' re com i ng back, of cou rse?
-Of cou rse.
I have to settle the bi I l, pack my father.
I th i n k you need a few hou rs alone
to make you r decisions.
What decision?
You' re a very ti red, very damaged man.
You've had a h ideous marriage,
I assu me a few tacky affai rs along the way.
You' re u nderstandably rel uctant
to get i nvolved agai n.
And here I am with th is preposterous idea...
you th row everyth i ng u p and go off with me
to some barren mou ntai ns i n Mexico.
Utterly mad, I know. On the other hand...
you fi nd th is world as desolate as I do.
You d id try to ki I l you rself last n ig ht.
So that's it.
Either me and the mou ntai ns,
or the bottle of potassi u m.
I' I l be back i n an hou r or so.
I' I l be i n my father's room.
Al I rig ht, I love you!
My God!
I repeat, I'm asking you
to come out peacefully.
These buildings are condemned
and unfit for habitation.
You people are possessing
this b uilding illegally...
and in violation of the law.
I'm asking yo u to come o ut peacefully.
S o th e h ospital h as assu m ed
th e respon si bi I ity...
for fi n d i n g 400 h ou si n g u n its
i n g ood bu i I d i n g s.
Th e h ospital wishes to poi nt out
that th is row of bu i ld i ngs on Fi rst Aven ue...
was condem ned by the city
before the hospital acq u i red ownersh i p...
and even then...
on ly after responsi ble leaders
i n the com m u n ity...
approved the bu i ld i ng
of ou r new d rug-rehabi I itation center.
God dam n it. I've got a dozen com m u n ity
leaders waiti ng for me i n the I i brary.
We' re tryi ng to work out
a negotiable form u la for two years...
with no hel p from you people
i n the U rban Affai rs Division, I m ig ht add.
I am not goi ng to th row
al I that down the d rai n...
because some cockamam ie activist g rou p...
is showboati ng for the television cameras.
You get those people out of those bu i ld i ngs
before a wal I col lapses...
or a fi re breaks out
and we've got a riot on ou r hands.
Okay.
Havi ng you r trou bles?
I won't take m uch of you r ti me.
My name is Wel beck.
I've been associated with th is hospital
for six years...
and yesterday afternoon,
Dr. G i I ley cal led me...
to tel I me he was cutti ng off my privi leges
with the hospital.
-Do you know anyth i ng about that?
-That's news to me.
-He said he sent the report on.
-l' I l probably get the report tomorrow.
-I assu me--
-A report about what?
I' m not su re myself.
I d id a neph rectomy on a man
about seven days ago.
Emergency cal led i n at 4:00 a. m.,
and the man was hemorrhag i ng--
I' m real ly sorry.
I do have a meeti ng to go to.
I n any event,
there's noth i ng I can do about it.
If G i I ley.... I' I l be i n the I i brary.
If G i I ley wants to cut you r privi leges...
he's Ch ief of S u rgery,
it's with i n h is provi nce.
You' I l have to have the heari ng.
I have a laparotomy for today.
I assu me l' I l be able to go th roug h with that.
I've been con nected with th is hospital
for six years.
It seems to me I've had you r name
down here before, for someth i ng.
Wait a m i n ute.
You' re the fel low...
with the Med icaid col lecti ng busi ness...
who i ncorporated and went pu bl ic, rig ht?
Someth i ng I i ke that?
M i lton Mead was tel I i ng me about you.
You' re a whole med ical cong lomerate.
You've got a factori ng service,
a com puterized bi I l i ng com pany...
a few proprietary hospitals,
a few n u rsi ng homes.
Good heavens, you shou ld n't be broug ht u p

You shou ld be i nvestigated by

You have to go th roug h with the heari ng.

What the hel I does the male establ ish ment
know about abortion?
Who the hel l

The issue at hand
is the control of d rug add iction...
i n th is com m u n ity
and i n the g hetto, personal ly.
-We don't want no goddam n abortion.
-Let's get to the core of th is matter.
The poi nt is that th is hospital

You know, I hal I uci nated last n ig ht.

You weren't hal I uci nati ng, M r. Mead.
-There was an I nd ian i n here last n ig ht.
-There was?
Okay. Down to the Operati ng Room.
Dr. Norris said about half an hou r.
-Okay. Com i ng u p fi ne.
-Half an hou r.

Okay. Go u p to Hol ly 6...

Who is that? Is that Mangafran n i?
Y eah. N u m ber 3.
Good morn i ng, Doctor.
It's legal for a doctor
to i ncorporate i n New Y ork, isn't it?
S i nce last Septem ber.
If they'd had that when I was you r age,
I'd have put away a cou ple of m i I l ion.
It g ives you a variety of deferral devices.
Profit shari ng, for exam ple.
Let's say you pick you rself
an October 31 fiscal.
You declare a bon us payable i n '7 1.
An accrued item payable
to a pri nci pal shareholder m ust be paid...
with i n two and a half months after the year
end, to get the ded uction i n the prior year.
But you r corporation doesn't pay that tax...
because we've el i m i nated
the taxable i ncome with the bon us.
With two taxable entities,
you can bu ry a lot of expenses.
Hel lo, th is is Wel beck.
Any messages for me?
I' m at the hospital.
I gotta cut open some g uy soon.
I' I l try to make it as fast as I can.
How u rgent d id he say it was?
Doctor Hogan made those arrangements
with the u nderwriters.
The reg istration statement
was fi led with the S EC wel I over a year ago.
If he cal Is agai n, have me paged here.
-Mangafran n i, rig ht?
-Rig ht.
What do you say?
We' re not gon na hang it i n the Louvre.
There's no pu lse, Doctor.
-What's the pressu re?
-There's no blood pressu re.
No pu lse. Get the tu be and EKG.
-What's the matter?
-I can't feel a th i ng here.
-What the hel I happened?
-I don't know.

-Did you check the gases?
-I d id.
'Cause the on ly ti me

Get the dam n leads on.
For Ch rist's sake, what the hel I is th is?
S he's a you ng woman.
S hou ld we open the chest?
-S he's 53, you button-head.
-Bicarb.
Jesus H. Ch rist!
Stop for a m i n ute.
-V-fi b, Doctor.
-Get me the padd les.
I may be crazy, Doctor,
but I don't th i n k th is is you r patient.
What the hel I are you tal ki ng about?
I don't want to get i nto an i ntesti ne hassle.
The mal practice here is mon u mental.
As you can see,
Dr. Schaefer's blood sugar was 23.
No g I ucose sol ution is goi ng to do that.
The on ly th i ng that' I l do it...
is at least 50 u n its of i nsu I i n,
probably more.
We m ust presu me one of the n u rses shot 50

I' m very sorry, Doctor.
-May I use you r phone?
-Certai n ly.
Did you ask the head n u rse

-Y es.

-I better get down there d i rectly.
Have you cal led the OOD?
You better cal I Dr. G i I ley.
And cal I M r. S loan.
I' I l be rig ht down.
I' m very sorry.
There's a very nasty one i n the OR.
They've j ust operated on the wrong patient.
I don't u nderstand. Is she back i n her room?
When d id she get back i n her room?
Who broug ht her back?
S he's back i n her room.
-Who?
-M rs. Mangafran n i...
the woman who was
su pposed to have been operated on.
Are they sti I l worki ng on that woman i n 3?
I' m sorry, M rs. Fried,
cou ld you say that agai n?
Nobody i n th is office sent her back u p.
Al I rig ht, M rs. Fried.
I' I l have to cal I you back.
Did any of you take a woman patient
named Mangafran n i...
out of the hold i ng room,
back u p to Hol ly 5, arou nd 1 0:00?
-What happened?
-I don't know what happened.
A patient named Mangafran n i
was sched u led to have a hysterectomy...
at 1 0:00. Dr. Mal lory.
I tal ked to Sylvia, i n the hold i ng room,
who ad m itted her, so she was here.
Now I j ust spoke to M rs. Fried on Hol ly 5...
and she says an orderly
broug ht M rs. Mangafran n i...
back to her room about 20 m i n utes ago.
Now M rs. Mangafran n i
is i n her room, sleepi ng.
-Who's the woman i n the operati ng room?
-I don't know.
Is she dead?
They had to open her u p,
and that's not good.
I better get M r. Mead.
Now, we can rectify the i nj ustices...
of the world tomorrow, but rig ht now...
cou ld we get those people
out of those bu i ld i ngs?
Wi I l you please I isten to me?

Let's cal I a halt to th is...

-When d id it happen?
-About half an hou r.
-Cal led the Med ical Exam i ner?
-No.
You'd better do that now.
Cal I the preci nct station house, too.
Good morn i ng.
Th is is real ly someth i ng, isn't it?
I thoug ht she looked d ifferent
when they broug ht her.
I said to one of the n u rses,
"S he looks you nger without her dentu res."
I tal ked to her half an hou r before.
Does anyone know who she is?
What's her chart say?
Her chart and her bracelet
say " Mangafran n i."
The on ly th i ng that isn't Mangafran n i
is the woman.
Jesus H. Ch rist!
I've been choppi ng out
3 uteruses a day for 30 years...
is it too m uch to expect

I tal ked to her i n the hold i ng room.
S he was perfectly fi ne. A I ittle d rowsy.
I thoug ht it was fu n ny that
when they broug ht her i n, she was out cold.
We' I l have to stay here ti I l M r. Mead
or someone from the OOD comes back.
I' m not taki ng the rap for th is.
I've got one mal practice su it pend i ng.
I' m not taki ng the rap for th is one.
You' re not leavi ng.
I love you, and l' m not gon na let you go.
Let's start putti ng you r father's th i ngs back.
He's stayi ng here.
I' I l fi nd you an apartment.
I' m stayi ng i n a fi lthy I ittle hotel room.
We can't use that.
I can't make it, u p here. I' I l crack u p.
I can retai n my san ity

You can't real ly expect me...
to I ive i n a g rass shack and h u nt jackrabbit.
-Be sensi ble, for God's sake.
-I am bei ng sensi ble.
What is it you' re so afraid of leavi ng here?
You r plastic home?
You r cond itioned ai r?
You r synthetic clothes? You r i nstant food?
I' m offeri ng you g reen si lence, and sol itude.

Mostly, l' m offeri ng me.

You make it sou nd al most plausi ble.
I don't know why you even hesitate.
What's hold i ng you here?
Is it you r wife?
That's al I over.
If l' m married to anyth i ng, it's th is hospital.
It's been my whole I ife.
I can't wal k out on it
as thoug h it never mattered.
I' m m idd le class.
Among us m idd le class,

responsi bi I ity does.
Don't ask me to stay u p here with you,
because I love you, and I wi I l.
And we' I l both be destroyed.
I have the bi I l here to pay, yet.
I' I l come with you.
You wanted to know the name
of that d ialysis n u rse?
Who?
The one who goofed
on you r patient, Dru m mond.
Her name is T eresa Cam panel la.
You' re not gon na bel ieve th is.
S he d ied on the operati ng table of OR 3
about an hou r ago.
-What?
-You heard about the screwu p i n OR 3.
-You mean she was the one?
-I j ust identified her.
What is goi ng on?
Every ti me I try to fi nd somebody,
they either d ied of a heart attack...
or anesthesia shock i n an OR.
I j ust came from the OR.
They' re tryi ng to fi nd a Dr. Schaefer.
Doesn't a kid named Schaefer work here?
Did. He d ied yesterday
of an overdose of i nsu I i n. Why?
The n u rse says there's a Dr. Schaefer
hang i ng arou nd the hold i ng room.
Wou ld n't have been you r Schaefer.
N u rse says it was sen ior staff,
m idd le-aged man.
There's no sen ior staff by that name.
I told them that. I said, " I don't know
any sen ior staff named Schaefer."
They've got detectives down there.
A whole big i nvestigation.
-How'd the n u rse know h is name?
-H is nameplate.
I am the fool for Ch rist,
and Paraclete of Caborca.
For heaven's sakes, Dad.
What the hel l's goi ng on?
We thoug ht you were at death's door.
What are you doi ng out of bed?
What happened?
What's he goi ng at you for?
Did he say anyth i ng?
As a matter of fact...
he said, " I am the fool for Ch rist
and the Paraclete of Caborca."
S h ut that door,
because if he tel Is everybody...
he's the fool for Ch rist and the Paraclete
of Caborca, they' I l put us al I away.
He's ki I led two doctors and a n u rse.
I am the wrath of the lam b,
and the angel of the bottom less pit.
What do you mean?
I mean he's ki I led two doctors and a n u rse.
He j ust tried to ki I l me.
He has someth i ng agai nst doctors.
He got ahold of some i nsu I i n and put it
i n Dr. Schaefer's i ntravenous sol ution.
Somehow, he got Dr. Ives
to d ie of a heart attack...
i n the m idd le of the Emergency Room.
Somehow, he got a d ialysis n u rse,
Cam panel la...
to d ie of anesthesia shock
on an operati ng table.
He's been ru n n i ng al I over the hospital,
d ressed u p i n Dr. Schaefer's u n iform.
They' re looki ng al I over the place
for the mysterious Dr. Schaefer.
It's i ncred i ble to us both, but as you can
see, you r father is not a hel pless comatose.
I' m not the one who's crazy.
Ask you r crazy father.
I was merely an i nstru ment of God.
I ki I l no one.
They al I th ree d ied by thei r own hands.
Ritual victi ms of thei r own i nstitutions...
m u rdered by i rony.
"An eye for an eye."
Bi bl ical retri bution.
Schaefer was fi rst, because he ki I led God.
God was ad m itted
to th is hospital last Monday...
u nder the name of G uernsey.
I was instantly aware of a divine presence.
I was convinced this porcelain old man
was an angel of the Lord...
perhaps even Christ himself.
O ur savior was suffering from emphysema.
He was relen tlessly subjected
to the benefits o f m odern medicine...
and died at 7 : 30 that evening.
A few h o urs later,
he appeared to me in a revelation.
Ri se u p, D ru m m o n d.
Y o u are d ead, n ow yo u are resto red.
T h ose wh o ki I l ed yo u,
an d t h ose wh o ki I l ed m e...
wi I l d i e i n ou r pl ace.
You are th e Paracl ete of Caborca.
Th e wrath of th e I am b.
Th e an g el...
of th e bottom less pit.
Not quite the burning bush, perhaps,
but prodigal enough for me.
I was to avenge the death of God,
and my own brutalization.
I was to kill doctors Schaefer,
Ives, and Welbeck...
and the dialysis n urse, Miss Campanella...
wh ose negligence caused my coma.
I awaited a further sign from God,
which was given to me later that evening.
Dr. Schaefer had arranged an assignation...
with a girl from the Hematology Lab
named Sheila.
Boy, I su re h ope n obody wal ks i n.
-Wh at about h i m?
- H e' s zon ked out.
-Wh at' s n ew?
-N oth i n g.
-Wh at' s th i s?
-lt' s my i n su I i n.
I forgot to put it back.
What' s the i nsu I i n for?
I d id n 't know you were a d iabetic.
It ai n 't contag ious, don't worry.
You took the insulin from Dr. Schaefer's
pocket and put it in the IV.
Yes.
Then a n urse came...
and plugged the IV jar into Schaefer.
G od cl early i nten d ed
a m easu re of i rony h ere.
Th e h ospital was to d o al I th e ki I l i n g for m e.
Al I l n eed d o i s arran g e for the doctors
to become patients i n thei r own hospital.
The next morn i ng,
I pi nched some d igoxi n from the pharmacy...
and a sand bag from a uti I ity cart...
and fou nd my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory.
I crushed h i m with the sand bag...
and gave h i m a massive shot of the d igoxi n.
Th is broug ht on an i nstant cond ition
of card iac arrhyth m ia.
I waited for h i m to come to.
Then I broug ht h i m down
to the Emergency Room.
He had, at that time, perhaps an hour to live.
Prompt treatment would've saved his life.
He was sudden ly taken i I l.
I got h i m here rig ht away.
As a staff doctor,
he was seen with o ut preliminaries.
His vital signs were taken.
An electrocardiogram...
which revealed occasional
ven tricular premature con tractions.
An in tern to ok his history,
and then he was...
promp tly, simply...
forgo tten to death.
Simply mislaid.
Mislaid am ong the broken wrists...
the chest pains, the scalp lacerations...
the man wh ose fingers
were crushed in a taxi do or...
the in fan t with a skin rash,
the child swiped by a car...
the old lady m ugged in the sub way,
the derelict beaten by sailors...
the teenage suicide, the paran oids...
drunks, asthmatics, the rapes,
the sep tic ab ortions...
the o verdosed addicts...
the fractures, in farcts, hem o rrh ages,
c o nc ussio ns, b o ils, ab rasio ns...
the c o lo n ic cancers, the cardiac arrests...
the wh o le wo unded m adh o use o f o ur times.
W h o' s N u m be r 7 680 20 2-S?
I s t h e re anybody h e re wh o i s t h at n u m be r?
In this way...
was it revealed to me
the manner o f Nurse Campanella 's death.
She was to die
o f the great American plag ue :
Vestigial iden tity.

-At x-ray...

-Of cou rse.
Her operation, that is to say...
M rs. Mangafran n i's operation,
was not sched u led ti I l 9: 30.
At 9: 1 5 th is morn i ng, I rang for my n u rse.
Rang for you r n u rse?
T o i nsu re one fu I l hou r
of u n i nterru pted privacy.
I got u p, wheeled M iss Cam panel la
off to the operati ng rooms....
I exchanged
M rs. Mangafran n i's bed with hers.
I transferred the charts
and identity bracelets.
S he d ied official ly of anesthesia shock.
I n fact, she d ied because she was weari ng
another woman's identity.
God, what do we do now?
Let me take h i m back to Mexico.
It's a si m ple world there. He fu nctions there.
If you tu rn h i m i n...

-Let me take h i m back.
-Are you kidd i ng?
We' I l both take h i m. I' m goi ng with you.
Let's get h i m d ressed.
We' I l leave before the pol ice

You go and get them.

Then, pausi ng on ly to send i n you r bi I l,

Besides that, I have noth i ng agai nst you.
I' m su re you play a hel I of a game of golf.

How m uch do you make a year?
For a g uy who makes

Th is is Dr. Wel beck. Were you pag i ng me?
You've been tryi ng to reach me al I morn i ng.
He pu I Is out the wi res and the tu bes...
and he gets u p and he puts on

I' I l tel I you someth i ng else

You gotta get me out of here.
Th is is a crazy place.
Listen to me.

-What ki nd of a hospital is th is?

Someti me later, the g uy i n that bed there

Al I day, he lays there I i ke he's dead.

It never rai ns, but it pou rs.
A fi re broke out i n one of the bu i ld i ngs.
The sq uatters came out.
The pol ice tried to arrest them.
Now the situation has eru pted i nto a riot.
-You m ust be wonderi ng what th is is about.

M r. H itchcock wi I l stay with you.

But you r father isn't. Disappeared.
He put on Schaefer's u n iform
and took off to do God's work...
presu mably the m u rder of Dr. Wel beck.
-The g uy on the phone is Dr. Wel beck.
-What are you tal ki ng about?
Also, the other patient i n you r father's room
j ust overheard the whole confession...
and told the Ch ief Ad m i n istrator.
They' re send i ng for the cops.
Oh, my God. Who held title?
Do the u nderwriters know about th is yet?
