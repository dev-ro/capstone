[man] Today I'm gonna pray.
I'm gonna pray that God,
as usual, ain't looking.
I'm gonna pray that he slept in
and didn't make it to the office.
I'm gonna pray
that today will be different...
[dog barking]
...will be new.
Today, I'm gonna pray
for peace of mind...
in the name of the abused
and neglected...
and the motherfucker
that owe us all some money.
Amen.
[engine off]
- [woman] Mr. Charlie.
- Hey, Angela.
[Angela] You and me
need to have a little talk.
[sighs] What happened?
I don't want the motherfucking
police coming over here, okay?
They acting wild, they acting crazy.
They drawing attention to everybody.
Oh, goddamn it. I'm sorry. I...
I'll have a talk with them.
No, you said that shit two months ago
and ain't a motherfucking thing changed.
It's like you let him do
whatever the fuck he wants.
- That's not really fair, Angela.
- It is fair, Angela.
No, that's not really true.
Boys will be boys. You know that.
But I'm gonna have a chat
with him right now.
You handle your shit, okay?
I'm tired of this shit.
Bringing everybody's
motherfucking property down!
- Shh!
- You shh. Shushing me.
- [door opens]
- [Charlie] Hey. It's me.
[door closes]
Brought you some lunch.
[water running]
[knocking]
Listen... [sighs] Angela is screaming
at me out in the middle of the street
about you and your buddies.
You guys gotta bring
the noise levels down, okay?
I'm tired of listening
to her crazy ass.
I gotta go run some errands,
so I'm gonna leave your allowance
on the dining room table.
Are you gonna help me out with this?
Keep it down? Huh?
Promise? All right.
Little. Little circles.
All right. Bye.
"Earth."
"Venus."
[woman] Calvin!
Calvin, you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.
- What?
- Did you take your meds?
- [Calvin] No.
- Take your meds, Calvin.
I don't even like pills.
Get your ass up
and get to school.
I don't got school today.
Boy, would you quit lying?
The school called and said you
only been showing up for lunch.
Meals are important.
Gotta get those meal tickets.
Get your ass up and let's go!
I'm not playing!
"I'm not playing, Calvin."
Don't mock me, Calvin.
I was being nice. [sighs]
[mimicking airplane flying,
crashing]
- You didn't think that was funny?
- No.
No. [scoffs, laughs]
Can't get lucky.
What class you got today?
- Math.
- Math? You like math, right?
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm gonna help you practice. Um...
All right.
What's, uh, five times five?
- Twenty-five.
- [scoffs]
Eat up, baby.
Thanks, Mom.
I need you
to watch him on Friday.
Gloria got surgery.
Back to the club then.
Yeah, back to the club.
Shit's been a little tight around
here, in case you haven't noticed.
Tight? [chuckles]
- That's funny of you to say.
- What's so funny?
Eat your breakfast.
Nice one... Mom.
[chuckles]
All right.
What's, uh, ten times ten?
- A hundred.
- Pshh! My God.
[both laugh]
Stop this shit
and go to school. Now.
All right. Geez.
[snickers]
- Nicky, I'm not kidding.
- All right.
- [chattering]
- What's that?
[boy] My mom
taught me this saying...
"Sorrow is like treasure.
You only show it
to your friends."
Nigga, I'm going to school,
get my "edu-ma-cation."
- You ain't been all year.
- School is fun, Calvin.
Exactly.
School is fun!
Fill that brain with knowledge.
You feel me? Ah!
[boy] Then life taught me some
treasures you got to keep buried.
Everybody, I'm going back to school!
I'm going back!
[woman] No, you ain't.
Nigga, stop!
Come with me.
I'm going back.
[speakers:
hip-hop music playing]
[hip-hop continues
playing, louder]
What's up, Greg? Long time no see, nigga.
What's that been like?
- You tripping.
- Catch you in the hood, homey.
Peace out.
[helicopter whirring,
faint]
Bye-bye. [speaking Spanish]
[in English]
Oh, here you go.
Oh, thank you.
[chuckles]
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?
Great. Let's see.
Okay.
Do you have a form of ID?
That's all the ID I got.
We need two forms of ID.
That's our policy here.
Uh... I just...
I just got out of prison.
Um... I don't
make the rules, you know?
It's cool. All right.
Uh, let me give you my PO's number.
- Uh, but we still need two forms of ID.
- He'll straighten this shit out.
Do you have, like,
a driver's license?
Ain't got no goddamn
driver's license, woman.
I just got out
of fucking prison.
- [speaks Spanish]
- It's cool, dawg. It's cool.
Look, just call this number.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
No, you ain't.
[cashier] Next.
I'm serious here, Calvin.
You are a very, very smart young man.
- I mean, perhaps even... even gifted.
- [Calvin muttering]
Last year you scored in the
top ten percentile on the PSAT,
- and yet this year on the SAT...
- [scoffing] Nah.
If you just applied yourself,
there's no telling how far you could go.
Venus.
Excuse me?
I will be using my genius...
[mimics explosion]
...to go to Venus.
I'm trying to be serious...
Nigga, I'm being serious, too.
[chuckles, clears throat]
I'm gonna make arrangements
for you to retake the exam.
But you have to
apply yourself,
and for God's sake,
do not answer every question with a "D."
I mean, why would
you do that anyway?
- You really want to know?
- Yes.
"D" is for "damned."
[school bell ringing]
All right. Mess this nigga up!
Motherfucker, what?
- What, nigga?
- [men clamoring]
Come on. Get up.
Get up. [grunts]
Hey! Bringing
the motherfucking smoke, homey!
- [grunts]
- That's that East Side shit, nigga!
[hip-hop music
playing on car stereo]
[Calvin]
Well, we have arrived.
[door lock clicks]
- Thanks, Nicky.
- Tell the doctor to suck that shit out of you, okay?
- Shut the fuck up, Calvin! Stupid ass.
- [Calvin laughs]
[Calvin] I don't know why you're
getting all high and mighty with me.
You don't give a fuck about her. I don't
even know why you're acting all concerned.
I'm not arguing about it.
Me and Jesse are going somewhere else.
You can stay here
and raise your fucking baby,
'cause I'm not
staying around for that shit.
He's not getting the cape.
He is not getting it.
[man] We are all operating
on borrowed time.
Dancing from dream to dream
in between nightmares,
like little frightened children waiting
for our mothers to pick us up from school.
And she's gonna ask us,
"What kind of day did you have?"
- [helicopter whirring overhead]
- [man] Five-O! Five-O! Run!
Come on, man! Run!
[police sirens wailing]
- [man on video game] Get up!
- [blows landing]
- Yeah! Get some! Get some!
- [men shouting]
Yeah. What you want?
Come here. Come here.
- Don't let him go.
- Whup his ass.
[woman] Okay, would you rather have peas
for the rest of your life or broccoli?
- Broccoli.
- [woman] Okay, would you rather have chicken or steak?
- Steak.
- [woman] I knew you were gonna say steak.
[shouting, grunting continue]
- What up, Shawn?
- [man] Welcome back, homey.
- You need your yard cut?
- Nah. Nah, I'm good.
All right.
[knocking]
[chuckles]
Damn, Greg.
It's been a minute.
When'd you get out?
Uh, shit.
What, a week ago.
You look good.
You look real good.
I mean, I know there's nothing
else to do but lift inside,
but it's working for you.
Yeah, you know.
Uh, so I seen there was some oil
up under your car in the street.
They hook you up
with a job yet?
I'm still on the wait list, but,
you know, I'm out here, doing me.
Yeah. Yeah.
Good for you, baby.
Uh...
if you need a tune-up
or something,
you know, whatever you can
afford, it's cool.
Thanks, but truth is,
I'm kind of tight on cash these days.
- But, um...
- I hear you.
You need your hair braided?
On me.
I don't think it's there quite yet.
A few months, maybe.
Yeah. Almost.
[chuckles] Girl.
[both laugh]
All right.
- Uh...
- When it is, come back and see me.
On me, for old times.
All right then.
Be careful.
- It was good seeing you.
- Yeah, yeah.
Bye.
[Calvin muttering]
[imitates gunfire, laughs]
[barking]
You smooth, baby.
[chuckles, sighs]
[helicopter whirring overhead]
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Wait.
Slow the fuck down.
Oh. Us? Me?
Fuck. [laughs] Yeah.
[screams]
[laughs] Fuck you!
[imitates cocking gun, firing]
[imitates rapid gunfire]
[screams, laughs]
You're fucking scared.
Fly away, bitch! Fly away!
[laughing]
That motherfucker ain't right, Nicky.
What is that shit? I'm serious.
Hey, hey. Wait up.
Listen, wait up...
Nicky, I can't get no abortion,
and I'm tired of Calvin saying that shit.
He's just fucking with
you, all right?
I'm gonna take care of it.
Don't worry.
[woman] He ain't gonna
take care of shit.
Get your cracker ass outta here
before my slipper goes to slapping.
Hey, Curtis, come on out here.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Wait!
- You white-trash, Seabiscuit-lookin' motherfucker.
We got all these
beautiful Black kings
- and you open your legs up to white trash.
- Go sit down.
- [glass shatters]
- Hey, tell your mama check in with the homeys.
She still working nights?
Hey, Nicky.
[woman] Better not come

Mm-mmm.
No, I'm not having it.

Oh, shit.
Holy shit.
[Jesse] Calvin had an idea.
[Calvin shouting]
He said why don't we
take the game outside?
Now, I knew
what he meant.
Oh, shit, oh, shit.
And I can't say
I disagreed with him.
[chattering]
But had I known
what it would lead to,
I probably would have
just said, "Let's stay home."
...with the young bitches
with the yoga pants.
And we turn them bitches all the way
the fuck up! We turn them bitches up!
And we go on this wild ride in the
sky like Superman and come back down
with some Offwhite, too,
mixed up, fixed up,
rolled up with some Sour OG
and we only do switches.
We only do
motherfucking switches.
And I need me some Slurpee.
I need a Slurpee. Slurpee got some juice.
Want some fucking juice. I could do
juice too 'cause I love that shit.
That shit just be... The motherfucking
flavor! Know what I'm sayin'?
No air traffic control,
just stratosphere.
And then we just fucking take
a ride in the air, like, whoo!
And we just... go!
You know what I'm saying?
Just us and the wind.
Nigga, that shit

Now you out early?
Rolled up.

- I'ma stay outside. Owner don't like Bruiser.
- ...wretched be your name.
Thy kingdom come,
your shit gets done on Earth.
And wherever else you can
make a fucking dollar, right?
Sin is encrouched
at your door, young man.
And for you is its appetite.
Will you get the mastery over it?
- You steal! You stole me!
- I'm gonna take a piss.
You took me from my mama.
You stole me!
And you promised me
a fucking mule!
Where's
my motherfucking mule?
I'm that nigga that's left the pawn
shop, and I got a gun.
Hey, what's up, bro?
- What's good?
- I like your hat.
[grunting]
[Nicky] The keys! Calvin, the keys!
Give me the keys.
[laughs]
[engine starts]
[Calvin screams]
[Calvin muttering]
[man] Calvin, you hear me?
- You brush your teeth today?
- [young Calvin] Yes.
Can't be leaving the house smelling
like these other little niggas out here.
There's things that separate us.
Truth or lies. That's it.
The truth is who you are.
You hear me?
A lie is everything else.
I'm still putting together that
spaceship for you. Know that?
Fly wherever
you want to go.
It's gonna run
off pure energy.
[thumping]
- [all laugh]
- [Calvin] Oh, shit!
I fucking love you.
Thank you. Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Think, motherfuckers.
[muttering]
Oh, sh...
[muttering continues]
Gimme

- Did you get those pills?
- Yeah, I got 'em.
- Who got the pills? Oh, you got 'em.

Till next time! Boom!
[laughs]
[mother] Okay,

- Broccoli.
- Okay, would you rather have chicken or steak?
- Steak.
- I knew you were gonna say steak.
I'll be right back.
Going to the bathroom. Stay right here.
- Okay.
- Okay? I love you.
Hey, look at

Can't believe

[sighs]
[chattering]
[Charlie]
What you got there?
What's that, like,
an upside-down chicken?
Okay, that's what I want.
I'm starving.
[sighs]
Got the prettiest ears.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah.
[breathing rapidly]
Hey! Hey, get the fuck

Hello? Get over here!
Nigga, don't act like you don't hear me.
I will call 911, motherfucker.
Get over here. What do you think

[Greg] Calvin!
Get the... Calvin!
Calvin, dawg! [panting]
Get the fuck over here.
The fuck is wrong with you?
I'm looking at life right now.

Have you seen my son?
A little boy?

You see that shit?
Do you see that shit?
When we was younger, was he doing
this shit the whole fucking time? Huh?
I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking know.
- Jesse doesn't say anything.
- All right. We gotta have a plan.
Piece of shit. Piece of shit.
That disgusting piece of shit.
That motherfucker is dead.
He's fucking dead.
[door opens, closes]
[lock clicks]
[Jesse]
I always have the same dream.
In it,
there's three palm trees.
Like three really tall friends.
But then I'm alone...
by the ocean.
My feet
feeling the cool water.
[no audible dialogue]
Dreams ain't real.
[chattering]
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, what you doing back here?
- Trying to get it right.
- Get what right?
Oh, you need
your own little space.
Just need a place...
place for my own, Mama.
Mm-hmm. Just don't make a bigger
mess than is already back here.
You wanna maybe roll with me
to the hardware store later?
Sure, we can do that.
You want something to eat first?
Oh. [chuckles] My cooking's okay for
you, but my house isn't.
Hey, hey. You know.
[laughing]
- Love you, too.
- Thank you, Mama.
You're welcome, sweetie.
- We gotta take Keisha to the doctor tomorrow.
- Uh-uh!
- Don't forget.
- Uh-uh! Fuck no. I'm not doing that shit.
Oh, don't start with that.
Come on.
- No, I'm not doing that shit.
- We agreed.
No, we didn't agree on shit.
That's your business. Your business.
- Come on, General.
- General? I'm fucking viceroy. Get that shit right.
[laughs] Hey,
why aren't you the king again?
I'm working my way to the fucking top.
All right?
The nerve of some people. You really want
to live this regular fucking lifestyle?
You wanna raise a baby in this shit?
This shithole? Dumbass.
[sniffs]
Oh, shit, you smell that?
You fucking smell that?
You smell that shit?
It's fucking intrigue, my nigga.
[sniffs] Mmm. Oh, shit.

Is that him?
I mean, is that him,

- Oh, yeah, that's him.

Um, can we go talk to him?
Nah, nah, nah.
He just got out of the studio.
- Doesn't like to be bothered.
- Oh, my God.
I knew it. I told you
he was gonna make another album.
So what are you ladies
doing tonight?
Uh... we don't know.
We just got here this morning.
Maybe go to a club
or something.
- Hell yeah.

Let's party. Let's get out of here.

Laugh, motherfucker.
I ain't scared, man.

He sees you.
Dare the devil to step aside.
Ask him to say your name.
See which name he says.
You know his name.
[Calvin] The po-po

[Nicky] We got
a lot of shit in here.
- [women laughing]
- We got a lot of shit in here.
- [laughs]
- This is cool, but y'all got anything harder?
"Harder," the young man says.
Excellent, my dear Nicholas.
I believe we've found
a colleague in recreation.
Now, now, my dear comrade. We can't
assume that this is a man of leisure.
He could be, uh,
an upstanding family man.
- Then more outstanding for the cause of this adventure.
- [laughs]
Surely, if his thirst
for the game is ample,
then mere formalities will not intercede
and spoil the spirit of the night.

- Be chance or favor,
I wager my own honor that
this man fancies the sport.
All right, well, what does our governor
say about the night's festivities?
Mmm.
- [all cheer, laugh]
- At last!
The great oracle himself has spoken.
The game it shall be.
- [Nicky] The game it shall be.
- Are we going to see the Hollywood sign?
We so gotta get a pic.
Fuck no.
We're gonna see the universe.
Take a pill, baby.
What you having?
Ooh. I'm having

Now... if-if-if four-fifths
of the world is dark,
how is it that...
how is it possible that one-fifth
rules or oppresses
or exploits or dominates
that four-fifths
who are the majority?
It's by dividing
and conquering.
We're not brutalized
because we're Baptist.
We're not brutalized
because we're Methodist.
We're not brutalized
because we're Muslim.
[horn honking]
We're brutalized because
we are Black people in America.
[Calvin screams]
[thunder rumbling]
Take it easy.
[groans] Arthritis.
- Thank goodness it stopped raining.
- I got it. I got it.
I did... [laughs]
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.
- Okay. Okay, sweetie.
- Here's your keys.
Hey, Calvin.
Calvin, yo.
I need to talk to you, boy.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, Mama. It's all right.
[Jesse] I think
in that moment for Calvin,
it was the straw
that broke the camel's back.
The promises of his life,
the beginning
of all things broken.
[Calvin's mom crying] The doctors,
they told me Calvin was special.
They weren't sure
of his condition.
The outbursts,
the violence, the mood swings.
[sobbing]
What was I gonna do?
So I prayed to the Lord
for... for answers.
And I'll keep on praying till
the Lord answers my prayers.
[exhaling rapidly]
- You think it's time to take a break?
- Oh, Mama.
[both laugh]
I thought you might
want a beer, baby.
A beer?
Yes, Mama drinks a beer
every now and again.
Cheers.
- Mmm.
- You all the way gangsta now, huh?
Got your beer,
got your crib.
- [laughs]
- I ain't mad.
Oh, you're not mad at me?
[chuckles]
You got any papers?
- Oh, you trippin'.
- Gotcha. [laughs]
Yeah, it's getting there.
It's on its way.
'Bout how much longer?
- Soon.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm gettin' ready to go to the store.
Want anything in particular?
- PB&J.
- [laughing] So nothing's changed.
Why you asking
if you already know?
- Extra crunchy?
- Extra crunchy.
I'm just checking. I thought
maybe you growed up or something.
- Nah.
- [laughs] Okay, baby. Love you.
[sighs]
[Calvin crying]
- [sniffles, muttering]
- [door opens]
Calvin?
I got you this
for your birthday.
I was gonna give it to you then,
but I thought maybe you could use it now.
Go on.
I think
you're gonna like it.
Can I help you?
Okay.
Here we go.
Right around your shoulders.
Ohh.
Oh, the collar
and the button.
It's so royal.
Look. Take your arms out.
You're such a good boy.
You're a good boy, Calvin.
I need you
to watch Terry tonight.
All right, I'll handle it, but
that's, like, three nights this week.
Don't you worry about
what I do with my nights.
You need to be worried about how you're gonna
feed that baby you're supposed to be having.
It's sorted.
- I'm just saying, Nicky...
- You're just saying what?
I'm just saying.
[scoffs] It ain't easy being
a fucking parent. Shit's hard.
And how the fuck
would you know?
[scoffs]
Watch your fucking mouth.
Say, nigga! Cal!
Been looking
for you, boy.
[Jesse]
Things reversed for Calvin.
When he looked up,
he saw the ground.
When he looked down,
he saw the sky.
We know he buried his hope
with Bruiser.
So, you gonna jump?
Yeah.
- All right.
- [laughs]
- Good luck, nigga.
- Imagine that shit.
But jump to what?
The fucking ground?
No, fuck the ground.
Give me that cigarette.
What you doing up here?
Trying to get closer to God?
Fucking God.
I keep hearing that shit.
Like, where is the motherfucker?
I ain't met the guy.
No, I'm going to fucking Venus.
That's where I'm going.
- The planet? Nigga, gimme this.
- Yes, the planet. That's where I'm going.
How you gonna get there?
You don't see
what the fuck I got on?
- My bad. That's what's up with the cape?
- Exactly.
- I'm tripping. My bad.
- Exactly. Got to stay off the fucking ground.
Ground hot like hell.
They try to say
hell is underneath ground
and fire and pits
and all that devil bullshit.
No, it's right fucking here.
I seen the devil himself.
I talked to the nigga.
He's right here.
He live around the fucking corner.
- Right here?
- Yes.
For example, when you hit that
motherfucker, he was already dead.
- Did you know that? You were hitting a corpse.
- Don't talk about that.
You hit that nigga.
He was gone, like, boom!
The nigga was ash when he hit the ground.
That shit was wild.
- You think that shit cool?
- Yeah, I thought that shit was fuckin' cool.
- [laughs]
- [laughing]
- You scared to die, Greg, ain't you?
- I'm saying don't rush it.
You scared to die and shit.
Don't rush it?
Then I guess
you ain't heard.
Heard what, dawg?
I'm already dead.
[door opens]
[Charlie] Hey.
What's with this mess?
Looks like
a little piggy lives here.
Hey. Jesse.
- [object clatters]
- Fuck.
Hey, you in there?
[doorknob rattling]
Jesse.
Why'd you lock the door?
Come on. Open the door.
You...
What's going on?
You all right?
Hey, Jesse, don't fucking
walk away from me.
Goddamn it.
You little prick.
What the fuck's
wrong with you?
Jesus Christ.
Look what you made me do.
Calvin! The fucker's here!
We gotta go.
Get your shit together. Okay?
I'm gonna give you some space.
I spent 30 fucking dollars
on groceries.
[sighs]
Fuck you.
Jesse!
- Jesse, open the door!
- Open up.
You okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [door closes]
Hey.
You all good?
Look at me.
What the fuck?
Get him a fucking shirt.
Almost fucking had him.
Let's get the fuck
out of here, okay?
It's not your fault, man.
You know that, right?
You know that.
[woman] Aaron?
You're not alone anymore
about this.
- You understand me?
- Aaron!
- Jesse? Jesse? Look at me. Come on, bro.
- Aaron?
Look at me, man. Come on.
Aaron! Aaron!
Oh, my God, Aaron!
Look at me.
You're not alone.
We're gonna handle it. Okay?
- [TV playing]
- [woman laughs]
[woman] Here.
This is the part I like. Watch.
[laughing] Oh, my gosh!
I love that.
Mom, you're wild.
She used to be, son.
- Really, Charles?
- [TV: people laughing]
[minister on TV] When the asylum
lets you out into the world
of pain and trouble,
and you ask,
who's responsible
for this hell?
Who's responsible
for my misery?
- [laughing]
- [TV continues]
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh, my gosh.
I'll get it.
[minister on TV]
Where's God?
Jesse, where is God?
Is your dad home?
- Dad?
- Oh, my God!
Shut the fuck up.
God is looking for you.
Where is God?
- [all shouting]
- Shut the fuck up.
- Are y'all listening to me?
- Shut the fuck up.
- Stop!
- Shut the fuck up.
- Take anything.
- Shut up.
You gotta find him out here!
Great motherfucking year!
Does God put his children
in bondage?
- Shut the fuck up.
- [screams]
Does God let those
who love him die?
- [screaming]
- Suffer?
- Bitch!
- [shouting continues]
Daddy like to rape
little boys.
- What is he talking about?
- I'm sorry.
- Can I get a "amen"?
- Shut up!
- Can I get a witness?
- Shut up!
Can I get somebody here?
- [kicking]
- [groans]
Rise up with me.
- [woman screaming]
- Kill this motherfucker.
[minister] Y'all not paying no
attention to what I'm saying.
- [screaming]
- See you on the other side, bitch!
Black misery, I'm telling y'all.
Black misery loves company.
Fuck you!
[chuckles]
[woman sobbing]
Take anything you want.
[minister] But that misery?
Well, Jesse...
that misery
is yours to end.
[TV: congregation shouting]
[Calvin] Jesse. Jesse.
It's just me.
Uh, I got something
to tell you.
I fucking love you.
I love you like a brother, you know.
You and Nicky
are all I got.
You're all I fucking got.
And...
It's over.
You hear me?
You won't fucking
see him no more.
It's done.
[sighs]
Anyway, now we can fucking live a
new life and get the fuck outta here.
You can come stay with me.
Hope you could, uh...
Hope you could
think about that, you know.
Uh...
You got family, man.
Just, uh...
come over later.
I'm here.
[sighs]
[Jesse]
Because I don't speak,
people think that
I don't got a voice inside.
But no, it's there,
and it can get loud.
Are you ready?
- Let's fly.
- Times when it's the loudest, like now,
is when everything is calm.
Build up the capes!
- Because somehow that voice inside knows...
- One... two... three!
- Jump! Let's go!
- ...there's a storm coming.
[police radio chatter]

[no audible dialogue]
Nicky, look at me.
Nicky, look at me!
Look at me.
What did you do?
Nicky, what did you do?
Nicky, look at me.
Look at me!
Look at me. Baby.
What did you do?
What are you fucking looking at?
What are you fucking looking at?
Fuck, man.
What happened?
My phone.
My phone was in the car.
[Calvin] Fuck.
Forget it.
Hey, um...
you tell Jesse?
One other thing.
I need you to promise me,
you and Jesse,
that you're gonna take care
of my little one.
[chuckles]
What are you saying, man?
No, no, no.
I need you to do that.
You understand me?
I fucking promise.
Right.
[train horn blowing
in distance]
[train horn continues blowing]
Wonder where
that train is going.
Far from here.
[train horn continues blowing]
You ever been
on a train, Jesse?
We going
on a fucking train.
We gotta get him
out of there.
Gotta fucking
handle this shit.
Man, I... I feel stuck.
Hate fucking feeling stuck.
I'm not leaving without him.
Hell yeah.
[laughs]
My nigga.
I love you, Jesse.
[homeless man] See, baby boy,
you gotta be more like the Earth.
You spin silently,
but shake real loud.
Or you can be more like
the insects, you know,
'cause they carry
their own weight.
Or you could be
like the tree
and just dig your roots
all deep inside the earth.
Or you could be like time.
See, 'cause time,
time waits for nobody.
[man]
Hey, bro! I like your hat!
[laughs]
- You got him.
- That's what you get!
[sobbing]
You gotta be
more like the moon, son.
You gotta know
when to hide.
But now you can be
like the sun.
Shine, baby.
[sniffles]
Goodbye, my brother, you...
We'll see you in...
in Venus.
[sniffling, crying]
Mama, what's wrong?
[crying] No, no!
No, no, no.
No, Jesse, no.
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Jesse!
[sobbing] Jesse.
I'm...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[sobbing]
Hey, I'ma roll with you.
I'm driving.
[Jesse] Sometimes you wish you
had the right thing to say.
Or, in my case, anything.
[Greg] Something nice
about that water, huh?
Life's a lot
like them waves, Jesse.
Sometimes we feeling like...
feeling like there ain't
no rhyme or reason to this shit.
Can't nothing be further
from the truth.
What happened to Calvin, man,
that shit ain't gonna
go unanswered,
but you better believe it
ain't gonna be answered by you.
Hey, look, man.
Life got a way.
It do.
It got a way of just...
figuring that shit out.
I know why you're here.
You take all the time
in the world.
I'll be right here
when you get ready.
I love you. Don't move.
Hey, little brother.
You ever heard
of a thing called life?
L-I-F-E.
The "L" means life,
the "E" means everlasting,
but there's two letters
in the middle.
"If."
If you watch yourself.
Pick one...
and your wish
will come true.
One might take you to Venus.
That's my favorite.
Keep living, brother.
[woman] What's this?
Shiny rock.
Shiny rock? Okay.
Come on.
Let's go dry our clothes.
All right.
Drying clothes time.
Drying clothes time.
[Jesse]
Today I'm gonna pray.
I'm gonna pray that
God is looking out for me.
'Cause today...
things will be different.
