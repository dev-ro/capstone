What happened?
The right thing?
I used to know right from wrong.
Life used to feel right.
Kato raised me in the mountain village.
That I called home.
But I found the only friend in my life.
Happiness and love was within reach.
But then the dark dream came.
In the dream, I killed him.
Love was gone, replaced by blood.
Saya-sama!
Then I woke up, and it was not a dream.
Please take your father's sword.
I don't understand...
This sword...
has the power to slay demons.
It is a blessing, and a curse.
You still have much to learn...
However...
We have no more time!
The demons have found us!
Kato...
Kato
Wait here...
And don't come out!
I told you not to follow!
But we need to stick together-
We mustn't!
Kato...
There is no need, I must go alone.
You...
Just what are you planning?
I must complete my mission.
You can't, Kato!
You cannot face the demons yet.
It is my task for now.
Now, go!
Oh I'm very sorry, I didn't notice...
It's been 20 years since we've had people visit, but I hope you'll enjoy your stay.
I also noticed, you won't be needing any help with luggage?
Observant and caring, your wife is a lucky lady.
Yes.
As long you think so.
Shin, my daughter is preparing dinner.
It will be ready soon in the dining room.
I can't believe that!
Sorry!
Why are you still standing there?!
Come out and play my children.
The feeding season has begun.
Can you sense her?
Why are you still standing there?!
