[bell dinging]
-No, Samuel, not today.
-Please?
That's $47.50.
Maynard, I know our tab is pretty high,
but is there any way that we could...?
Oh, yeah, of course.
I'm sorry, it's just...
as soon as Bill finds a job...
It's not a problem.
I'll just write it down.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
It's just with the darn mill closing
and it being the holidays and all.
I understand. It's tough on everybody.
Thank you so much.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, Sam.
Here you go, buddy.
-Thanks, Maynard.
-You bet ya.
Thank you.
[Parker clears her throat]
You're a good man, May.
What are you gonna do?
The kid wanted a candy bar.
You know what I'm talking about.
Any coffee back there?
Two coffees coming up.
[bells ringing]
[sniffs, sighs]
Old cedar and fresh flowers.
Never get tired of the smell in here.
Afternoon, Bart. What you got?
I got elk steaks.
I got squab.
I got... wild boar.
-Is there anything you can't catch?
-Yeah, a break.
You interested?
You know, Connie loves these elk steaks.
She'd kill me
if I didn't bring something home.
I was kind of counting on that.
Hi, Parker.
Hello, Bart.
Here you go.
You still making that stuff?
Moonshine will drive you crazy.
The way I look at it,
we live on this tiny little rock that's
flying through the blackness of space
at about, what, 60,000 miles an hour?
And there's only
one damn way to get off it.
If that thought don't make you crazy,
I don't know what the hell will.
I guess you're right.
Never thought of it that way.
That's because you spend most of your time
stuck standing behind this counter.
You need to get out, Maynard,
and breathe some life.
I suppose I do. I suppose I do.
It all goes by in a flash, pal.
I mean, trust me, one day you'll wake up
and go, "Where the hell did it all go?"
For the next time you
wanna get a little crazy.
All right. Thanks.
-So, just the elk steaks?
-That'll do it.
Tell that pretty little wife of yours
she has excellent taste.
Will do.
Old cedar and fresh flowers, I love it.
Love it!
Hey, Park, you mind doing me a favor?
Of course. What's up?
You mind closing up tonight,
running to the bank?
What happened, your house on fire?
I just wanna surprise Connie, you know?
Go home, grill up these steaks.
A nice bottle of wine.
Some flowers.
Breathe a little life.
Sweet, Maynard.
Yeah, I'll close up.
[Maynard] All right.
Great.
Great.

Hey, honey.
Now don't have a heart attack,
but I decided to cut out a little early.
Wanted to spend a nice,
romantic evening with you.
I hope you're hungry, 'cause I got
a little something special planned for us.
Connie, you here?
[soft howling]
No way.
Did she get a puppy?
[dog howling]
[Connie]
Maynard?
Connie? What's going on?
What are you doing here?
In my home?
No, I mean now.
I wanted to surprise you.
[Sheriff Jack]
You know, I'm just gonna take off.
Jack?
-Is that...? What's going on?
-I can explain this.
You can explain
why you're dressed up like a rabbit
and having sex with a squirrel?
-I'm a wolf.
-We don't have sex.
That's right. According to the club,
you can't even have sex.
-Club? What club is this?
-Well, it's the kind of club where--
You-dress-up-like-a-squirrel-
and-have-sex-my-wife club?
I'm a wolf.
How many people are in the club?
Well, in the tri-county area
we got... what is it, 32?
Look, I've been meaning
to talk to you for a while.
A while?
How long has this been going on?
That's not important, Maynard.
What is important is that I'm bored.
Get a hobby!
Learn to knit, do macramé.
-Are you kidding me?
-We don't do anything!
We don't go anywhere!
I need some excitement in my life!
So instead of talking to me about it,
somewhere in your brain,
the thing that makes sense,
is to go out
and have sex with a squirrel?
I'm a wolf!
[howls]
Get it? It doesn't make any sense
as a squirrel!
It's gotta be a wolf!
Jack, we have been friends forever.
I know.
That's why I'm gonna need
to ask a favor of you.
Sure thing, whatever you need, buddy.
You know, I'm kind of a big deal
in this town
and don't think it'd be good
if people knew I was a furry.
What's a furry?
Furry. It's this club we belong to.
Well, don't 32 other people already know?
Seriously, Maynard, okay?
I'm gonna need your word on this.
I think we need to take some time apart
and think about what we really want.
Maynard! Maynard! You're gonna
have to keep a tight lip on this.
I'm kind of a big deal around here.
-Well, I am.
-I know.

[chipmunks on radio]
Merry Christmas everybody!
You're still here.
I was just about to call it a night.
That's why you're the best.
Are you drunk?
First time since my wedding night,
and we all know how that turned out.
I don't understand.
What happened?
Well...
I went out to breathe some life...
and then life decided
to take a poop on my face.
So, I ended up breathing poop instead.
Rabbit and squirrel poop, to be precise.
What? Maynard,
you're not making any sense.
You're right!
Because he wasn't a squirrel.
He was a wolf!
He's a wolf.
[howls in high pitch]
Doesn't work if he's a squirrel.
It only works if he's a wolf.
Sorry for the confusion.
It was a wolf.
Let's make you some coffee.
-No, I want my moonshine.
-Okay.
Bart gave me this.
This stuff is making me crazy.
-No argument here.
-It's okay, Parker.
'Cause you gotta get crazy sometime,
because of the speeding little rock.
-You want some?
-No, I think I'm good.
Let's get you home.
I don't have a home.
Of course you do
and Connie's gonna be worried sick.
There's no Connie.
She's been replaced
by the Easter Bunny's evil twin
She left me.
What?
Yeah.
Oh, Maynard.
I'm so sorry.
Is there anything that...?
Is there anything that I can...?
No.
I just wanna sit here.
Let me take you back to my place.
It's fine.
It's fine.
I just wanna be here alone...
think about wolves, and rocks, and stuff.
You sure you don't want me
to stay with you?
Let me ask you a question.
This is very important.
Okay.
Do you belong to a furry sex club?
I think you'll be fine by yourself.
-It's important to me.
-Yeah.
I don't want you to wind up
like a furry animal sex freak.
I'm gonna come back
first thing in the morning, okay?
And you do me a favor and get some rest.
Okay?
[howls]
You were right, my friend.
Here's to going crazy.
All right...
I'll play freaky forest animals with ya.
You know what a gorilla
would do to a bunny,
or a squirrel, or whatever?
Eat them alive!
[Parker] Maynard? [gasps]
Oh! Maynard, you should get up!
Okay? I'll just-- I'll shut the door.
Bunny.
Squirrels.
Gorilla.
What are all these people doing here?
[announcer on radio]
And now, for a story on a...
You gotta see this.
We go out live to Stacy Gutierrez
for a special report.
-Stacy.
-Thanks, John.
Hi, this is Stacy Gutierrez,
live in front of the once thriving,
but now abandoned, Pottersville Mill.
I'm here with the local townsfolk
who claim to have witnessed what
they're calling, well, a Bigfoot sighting.
So, tell me, what did you see?
Well, we were all out in the woods
smoking a...
You know, hanging out.
When all of a sudden
this big, huge, hairy thing
comes running by, screaming.
We were like,
"Hey, how stoned are you?"
And then we realized we all saw it,
and we were like... "cool."
I was upstairs dozing off
when I heard her scream.
I heard this ruckus in the backyard
and looked out the window
and I saw this... thing,
chasing a bunny.
[man]
I come running down the stairs,
turned on the back porch lights
and there it was.
We saw it. Squatch.
[Stacy Gutierrez] You've lived here
your entire life, correct?
[man] Yes, ma'am, I have.
[Gutierrez] Have you ever seen
anything like this before?
No, ma'am. Like the kid said,
it was a big, hairy thing.
Sort of half man, half gorilla.
You know, like them cavemen
you see in the picture books...
that ain't quite evolved yet.
And all that chasing the bunny
must have made him pretty thirsty,
'cause he was out there in our
little boy peeing fountain drinking.
I mean, literally, the little boy
was peeing right in his mouth.
[Gutierrez]
Then what happened?
[man] Then he just disappeared
into the darkness.
-There you have it, John.
-Can you believe that?
-A pretty incredible story.
-Yeah, that's something.
Bigfoot, right here, in our own backyard.
I might have to come up there to try
and catch a glimpse of him myself.
That sucks.
-[Gutierrez] You should!
-[both laugh]
I'll be right back.
Is everything...?
Sir, I'm sorry.
Can you pick up, please?
Is he here?
We have a bit of an emergency
going on right now, Maynard.
Trust me, he's gonna
want to hear about this.
All right. Go ahead.
Ma'am, can you repeat that, please?
Sure. Absolutely.
Yeah, well, we could either do it here
in my office, or go out to Phoebe's Knob.
Four o'clock. Thank you.
I was gonna talk to you, man, I promise,
but things are nuts
around here this morning.
Yeah.
Maynard, I'm not
having an affair with Connie.
It's just about the club.
I mean, hell, that could've been anybody
from the club up in your bedroom.
Thanks. I feel a lot better now.
There's nothing romantic.
I'd never do that.
It's just about the costumes.
Speaking of costumes...
Sheriff, sorry to interrupt,
but there's a producer from
some television show on the phone for you.
Thanks, Tammy.
Look, I've gotta take this. But...
We're okay, right?
Hey, I'm never gonna
rub the bunny again. I promise.
-I gotta show you something.
-I gotta take this.
Everybody's apeshit
over this Bigfoot business.
Later, okay? We'll talk later, all right?
Hello. Yeah, this is Sheriff Clark.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
Hi, how are you?
Good to hear your voice as well.
Well, let's see.
Maybe we can make something work...
Just the man we were looking for.
We were wondering
if you could do us a favor.
Now, we've been researching this whole
Bigfoot thing, and people really love him.
It's true.
He's been around for centuries,
and people on every continent
and that speak every language,
they just can't get enough of this guy.
Yeah, so we've decided to get
into the Bigfoot business.
We're gonna start this
whole cottage industry...
Bigfoot t-shirts, hats, bumper stickers,
baby onesies, you name it.
Everything. We were just wondering
if we could sell some stuff in your store?
So, what do you think?
Sure, fellas.
Whatever you need.
Awesome.
Thanks.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I was wanting to talk to you
about last night. I've been thinking--
I know we need to talk, Maynard,
I just can't right now.
I've got something to do.
-What's more important than--
-Bigfoot.
Seriously? You believe in all that?
Are you kidding me?
I love it.
It's the most exciting thing
to happen to this town for decades.
[Connie, voice-over]
It's is the most exciting thing
to happen to this town for decades.
[Bart, voice-over] Stuck standing
behind this counter.
You need to get out, Maynard!
[Tony]
Just the man we were looking for.
[Norm] ...this whole Bigfoot thing,
and people really love him.
[Sheriff Jack] Everybody's apeshit
over this Bigfoot business.
[TV announcer] Wow. Bigfoot, right here,
in our own backyard.

It's kind of nice, isn't it?
All these new people visiting the town?
Oh my God! Guys! Come quick!
-What's going on?
-Come on! You're not gonna believe it!
Brock!
Monsters are here!
Land it here!
Who's that?
You've never seen his show?
Oh, it's awesome.
Each week he goes after some monster...
Loch Ness, Chupacabra,
the Abominable Snowman.
This dude's amazing!
There's a rumor floating around that
there may be a Sasquatch in these parts.
Exactly. Follow me on Twitter.
For starters, let's see a show of hands...
How many of you
have actually seen the Squatch?
Wow. What about you, love?
What exactly did you see?
I was about to get in my car
and whoosh...
he ran right in front of me.
He must have been ten feet tall.
-He was as big as a tree.
-Three meters.
I saw him out at Grasshopper Hill,
and if Millie says he was ten feet tall,
I gotta say he was even bigger.
I think he was as big as a house.
Did Connie enjoy her elk?
Well, she's been enjoying
all kinds of animals lately.
From everything I've heard,
it sounds to me
like we should start our search
at the Grasshopper Hill.
If any of you would like to join us,
despite the peril,
we could use your help.
I could form a search party.
Much obliged, sheriff. Cheers.
Cheers back to you.
I'm a huge fan of you.
I'm gonna get you an autograph.
Remind me to get him an autograph.
-Don't forget.
-Oh my God.
Well, well, this is quite a turn out.
Sheriff, if you don't mind.
All right folks, I want you to
spread out and form a single-file line.
A single-file line, people.
Now, these are not toys.
Not a toy. All right?
These are only to be used if you find
something or run into some evidence.
And if you do, make sure
you don't touch anything.
Do not touch anything.
-Is there an echo out here?
-Sorry.
Showtime.
One for you and for you, nice lady.
[whistle blows]
What did you find?
Well, I saw this, but I didn't know if...
Dang it, Jasper, it's just a dead deer.
Did I not tell you
that these were not toys?
I know, but...
Are you stoned, Jasper?
Because I swear, I will drag you
down to the station,
-and I will drug test your butt.
-He will drug test your butt.
Wait, wait, look here.
That is very interesting, isn't it?
Very interesting indeed.
Do you see how the leg
is snapped back there?
-Only a Squatch would do that.
-Or a hole.
What's that, then?
Probably stepped in a hole,
broke its leg and died from exposure.
For your information,
this type of injury is mostly seen
amongst the deer of the
Mt. Tamborine region of Queensland,
caused by the Australian Yowie.
I have heard of rare instances
where it's been done
by its North American cousin...
The Bigfoot.
But I've never seen it before
with my own eyes...
until right now.
So, thanks for the input, mate, but...
I think I'm the expert here.
Now, now.
This was definitely a Squatch.
Spike, we'll go one more
as a promo, yeah?
-Great idea.
-Keep me in like a cowboy, yeah?
You got me?
Three, two...
There's definitely
a Squatch in these woods.
One more. I'm gonna do the spectacles
because it's kind of neat.
Change up.
Three, two...
There's definitely
a Squatch in these woods.
I didn't love that one.
I'm gonna go one more time. And...
Really be with me on when "There's
a Squatch in the woods," yeah?
All right.
Action.
There's definitely
a Squatch in these woods.
-That one. Great.
-Yeah.
Now where do we get a Foster's?
Foster's. It's Australian for beer.
Oh, beer.
So, what do you do now, Mr. Masterson?
Now we must track the beast.
We must venture out at night.
Alone. That's very important.
The Squatch is a primarily
nocturnal creature.
It will be incredibly dangerous,
but we must strive to get some
film or photographic evidence of it.
So, are we actually gonna be on TV?
Unless anybody's got a problem
with this town being... famous.
I'm not sure how many of you saw
my adventure into to the Himalaya
to search of the Yeti?
You were so brave.
Do you ever dress up like
the animals you're in search of?
You know, like camouflage?
Can't say that I have,
but I like your thinking.
Somebody get me a net,
I think I found a mermaid.
She's not. She's got legs.
I wrote a little song
about my quest for the Yeti,
and I don't suppose you'd like me
to play for you right now, would you?
No, I couldn't.
This is dedicated to Nelson Mandela.
Sorry.
Always chokes me up. Thank you.

-Not now, Maynard.

I couldn't possibly.

[loud screeching]
Now, you all know who I am.
What I do for a living.
If you really wanna
put this town on the map...
be world famous,
flooded with tourists...
We gotta be the first to catch
this Bigfoot, or Squatch,
or Yeti... whatever you call it.
Well, I'll catch this bird for you,
but it won't be easy.
It won't be like catching a squirrel
or a cute little bunny rabbit.
And it won't be pleasant.
But you all gotta make up your minds
about something.
I mean, do you wanna go back
to being the same old, boring town,
or be the Pottersville that
the whole world knows about?
'Cause I'll find him. I'll catch him.
And it'll give you a hell of a lot more
than one TV show.
Thanks Bart,
we'll take that into consideration.
Think about it.
Let me know.
Sheriff.
Mr. Singing Television Man.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Connie, please don't say anything.
Okay? I just need you to sit there
for a moment and listen to me.
I'm Bigfoot.
I know-- I know it sounds crazy, but I am.
I mean, I'm not, obviously.
Really, it's just a costume.
You know how you said you loved it?
And you said you needed
some excitement in your life, and...
and this is the most exciting thing
to happen for years?
That's why I did it.
I did it for you.
I did it for all Pottersville.
Now I just need to keep this thing going
long enough until they get their show.
So many people have their heart set on it.
I can't let them down.
I just thought you should know.
-Hey, Ali?
-Yeah?
Can you find out if there's a place
in town that does eyebrow threading?
-Oh, yeah.
-I'd like them tweaked a little bit.
Okay. Shall we? Yeah?
I will bite it off if you do that again.
I'll bite the hand clean off.
-Swallow it.
-Please don't touch him.
Thanks.
Good luck to cowboy. Yeah?
-The opening?
-We're set.
We'll do the whole opening from the top.
And in three, two, one.
I'm coming in hot.
We get our first shot. And...
Here we are out at Grasshopper Hill,
amidst the flora and fauna,
where there have been
numerous reports of a Sasquatch.
Well, we've all...
What are you doing?
I'm sorry?
You're sorry?
You're sorry? You're... in my eye line
when I'm doing the intro of my lifetime.
Maybe the greatest intro ever
and I've got you in my eye line with this.
What's that?
Are you a professional?
-Yeah.
-Yeah?
-I was--
-Why don't you use your head, mate?
-What were you doing?
-I was--
I was...
-I was checking the light.
-Checking the light.
He's checking the light.
How was it?
How's the light?
-'Cause the show now is rubbish.
-I'm sorry.
-He's sorry.
-It won't happen again.
Sorry and it won't happen again.
It will not happen again,
because I'll use your butt
as Bigfoot bait, okay?
-It won't happen again.
-It won't happen again.
Ready? Shall we try it again?
Without this idiot in my shot?
Okay. Ready?
Best show ever. Here we go.
First positions. Everybody knows
where they're supposed to be. Okay.
I'm gonna prep it and come in hot.
Coming in hot. Okay.
Three, two, one.
We're out here at Grasshopper Hill.
Let's switch on the night vision.
And see if this Squatch
wants to come out and dance.
There is an interesting detail...
which is that the Squatch,
particularly the North American Squatch,
he's drawn to wood.
And the reason being because
the wood has so much sap in it...
it's got tons and tons of sap,
and the Squatch feeds on this sap,
to feed its powerful libido.
Let's see if we can draw him out.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Come out for sap.
Did you hear the rustle?
We've got something.
I think we've got something.
Let's see...
if we can get this Squatch
to respond to our claps.
The Squatch is inclined to mimic us,
its human cousin.
Let's see if it will mimic my claps.
We'll go again.
Come out and dance, Squatch.
Come out and dance.
We've got something.
Okay. Selfie stick.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I, Brock Masterson,
here at Grasshopper Hill,
shall now attempt
to communicate with the Squatch.
[howls]
[Bigfoot growls]
Wilkins, okay, best work ever,
but you're way too close.
Back it off a little, please.
-That wasn't me.
-Okay. Very, very funny, mate.
You sound great, but it's way too close
so back it off,
and, like, 50 percent of that, okay?
I'm telling you that wasn't me, I swear.
Wilkins?
Wilkins?
I think there's something really out here.
What?
I don't know, but it just ran past me
and he's heading in your direction.
[Bigfoot growls]
[scared panting]
I don't think they got their picture.
Great. I'm all packed,
we'll get the hell out of here.
You can cut the Brock routine,
it's only me.
-Where's your stuff?
-I've been thinking...
-I just talked to the network...
-No...
I'm done with this nonsense
and this ridiculous
third-rate cable TV show
that, by the way,
is just barely beating the Family Feud.
-Just hear me out.
-No. Ain't gonna happen, okay?
Are you nuts? I'm not gonna let my ass
get eaten by Bigfoot, or Sasquatch,
or whatever the hell thing
is out in the woods.
-I will not let that happen.
-Did you see that thing?
Obviously, I wouldn't have done this
if I thought Bigfoot was real.
Calm down.
This is what we do.
We get that local hunter guy,
you know, with the fingernails...
-Are you nuts?
-I talked to network, they love the idea.
Think about it, not only
does it make a great show,
but if he actually catches Bigfoot...
You mean, if I actually catch Bigfoot.
Right, if you catch Bigfoot,
you will be the biggest star in the world.
-You really think so?
-Are you kidding me?
It would be the greatest moment
in television history.
So, I think what you mean is...
it would get me off this stupid show,
right?
I mean, if I catch Bigfoot,
that's our biggest episode ever.
No way to top that.
Perfect time to retire Brock.
Blaze of glory.
-Start doing movies like we talked about.
-That's what I'm saying.
So what do you think?
Crikey!
I know. This face
is such a movie face, right?
Such good face.
Yeah?
Bart, it's me.
Who the hell is me?
It's me, Bart. It's Jack.
The sheriff.
If you've come for my still,
you can piss off.
I'm not here for the still, Bart.
Look, I got a couple of people out here
who wanna talk to you.
People from the TV studio.
Hi.
-What do you want?
-We want you to help us catch Bigfoot.
How much?
We can pay you 5,000 dollars.
Five thousand to go with you,
10,000 to find him and catch him.
-Fine.
-And we do it my way.
-Meaning what?
-We go alone.
You and me alone in the woods?
What about the crew?
We have a whole show to shoot.
I suggest you bring your camera.
Not quite that simple, mate.
-We can figure it out.
-There's hair and makeup and such.
We're not going to catch imps and fairies.
We're going out to catch--
You know what? I'm coming with.
-The hell you are.
-Actually, wait.
I think-- that, actually,
is a very good idea.
Bart, I'm the sheriff, okay?
And if we're gonna catch Bigfoot,
I'm gonna be there.
It's a great idea.
Alright, the three of us.
We ain't opening a beauty parlor.
By the truck in ten.
Go on.
Ten minutes by the truck.
We love your house.
[Brock] Couldn't be a beauty parlor
under the circumstances.
I just don't understand
even the reference.
Keep the change.
Don't worry about it.
Gee, thanks.
Enjoy your stay in Pottersville.
Let's go, boys.
[woman] I suppose the next thing
you're gonna tell me
is that you had lunch with Bigfoot.
Did he ask for his pants back?
[woman #2]
Are you calling me fat?
-If the shoe fits--
-Ladies, what in the world?
She's trying to say that
she's seen Bigfoot more than I have.
But everybody knows
she's just trying to get on the show.
All right, that's enough.
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
Good Lord, what is going on around here?
Thank you.
Step right up, folks, get your brand new
Bigfoot merchandise.
That's right.
Get it while we still have a Bigfoot.
What did you mean,
"while we still have a Bigfoot"?
Because of Bart.
-What about him?
-You didn't hear?
They're putting him on Monster Finder.
What?
You know Bart, if anybody
can catch Bigfoot, it's him.
-Let's get these unpacked.
-Okay.
You got it.
Guns, huh?
How the hell did you think we were gonna
catch him, with a big butterfly net?
Oh, yeah. We can't kill it, right?
Just tranq' guns, Brock.
Make him go beddie-byes.
Right, tranq’ guns.
-Tranq' guns, Eileen, I knew that.
-What?
I was testing you guys.
Of course they are tranq’ guns.
Sheriff, would you be a doll?
I got a bit of a Yoga injury.
I got a Yoga injury. Thank you.
Thanks, lovely.
I wish they'd find whoever's doing it
and just be done with it already.
Doing what?
Pretending to be Bigfoot.
How do you know
it's someone pretending?
[laughs]
Because there's no such thing
as a Bigfoot.
Hmm.
What's all that crap?
Just a few essentials.
Some night vision.
Helmet cam, light meter.
Pheromone spectrometer
which is my own design.
It reads the pheromones
of beasts or monsters.
You're so great, why do you need me?
-Jack, pick up that tent, would you?
-Tent?
Are we spending the night?
What did you think,
we were going for a couple hours,
be back in time for you to watch
Dancing with the Stars?
This is a hunt, not a day at the spa.
How long are we planning on staying?
Until we catch him!
Okay, Mr. Singing Dancing Television Man,
times-a-wasting. Get in the car.
What? You'll be fine.
-You'll be fine.
-Oh, my God.
I'll try and bring him back in one piece.
Give me a break.
I bet a dollar to a dime that
it's just some prankster out there
having a big laugh at our expense.
But if it's a hoax,
I don't think he's trying to be mean.
Look at how happy he's made everybody.
At first, but the whole town has changed.
Now everyone is dying
to get on that stupid TV show.
I think they're just looking for something
that gives them a little hope.
So, if it's not really a Bigfoot,
if it's just some guy pretending,
what do you think they'll do to him
if they catch him?
Hell, knowing Bart, probably shoot him
and hang his head on the wall.
I'll get him.
[Brock] I'm just outside of Pottersville,
where it is nine o'clock
in the post meridian.
And, ladies and gentlemen, for the first
time in Monster Finder history,
this find has proven to be so treacherous
that I am out here completely alone.
Aided only by the sheriff,
for legal reasons,
and a local guide...
who is quite curmudgeonly.
What the hell is he doing?
I think he's filming his TV show.
Is that thing gonna be on the whole time?
Guys, please. I'm filming my show.
That means I've gotta capture everything.
Sorry.
Can we watch?
Yes. In fact, I think you should watch,
so you can get ready.
For what?
For the Bigfoot, mate.
For the Bigfoot.
Now, I shall try
to communicate with the beast.
[yodels]
You having bowel problems?
I'm communicating with the Squatch.
By yodeling?
-It's a mating call.
-Oh. So you wanna hump Bigfoot?
It's a coyote.
That's his way of communicating with us.
It's a coyote.
Very specifically...
there's a Squatch
pretending to be a coyote.
It just gets wilder.
That's what the Squatch does.
[coyote howls]
See.
Definitely a coyote.
Okay, fine.
-That's for sure. It's a coyote.
-Definitely a coyote.
Fine...
Get out a secret weapon.
Secret weapon.
You gonna write another one of them
Yeti love songs?
A secret weapon against the Squatch...
is our humanity.
So we shall try to lure him in
with the gift of melody.
Maybe we're gonna have one of them...
Bigfoot hoe-downs.
I hope you got some more moonshine.
[howls a melody]
-What?
-You're gonna wake the whole county.
-You think it's stupid, don't you?
-No, I don't think you're stupid.
I just think maybe sometimes when it comes
to thinking, you have bad luck.
I don't understand why it's not working.
It worked perfectly last time.
I hear you, brother, but I've laid bait
and tripwire around the perimeter,
so we'll know when he's coming.
Bait and tripwire.
Is that safe?
[howling]
You okay?
Do you want me to do that?
No, I'm fine.
You can take off if you want.
I'll wait till you're done.
I'll get the bank bag,
I can drop it off on my way home.
Great. Thanks.
Thanks.
What?
Do you need anything else?
Nope, all good.
Thanks for doing it.
Good night, Maynard.
What the hell was that?
-What am I supposed to do with this?
-If you see Bigfoot, shoot him.
I've set up bait and tripwire
around the perimeter of the camp,
and the tripwire has just been tripped.
So, let's see
if we've got ourselves a Squatch.
-[branch breaks]
-[voice cries out]
What the...?
I think I got him.
I think I got Bigfoot!
What happened?
You shot Jack.
-Where's Bigfoot?
-There's no Bigfoot.
It was just one of your coyotes looking
for a romantic evening of dinner and song.
-Is he gonna be all right?
-He'll be all right, just taking a nap.
Nobody died on this trip.
Yet.
[Bart, voice-over]
'Cause I'll find him, I'll catch him.
[Maynard, voice-over]
Is there anything you can't catch?
[Norm] You know Bart. If anybody
can catch Bigfoot, it's him.
[Parker] Probably shoot him
and hang his head on the wall.
Hey, it's me.
You gotta get me out of here.
Why? What's the matter?
We didn't hear a peep
from Bigfoot all night.
And I haven't slept
and I haven't eaten,
and on top of everything else,
I'm taking a crap in the woods right now.
-Are you serious?
-[Brock] Yes, I'm pooping right now...
-while I'm talking to you.
-Ew. That is so gross.
What am I supposed to do?
It's not like there are bathrooms here.
First of all, you could
not call me while you're doing it.
Besides, what are you doing
about toilet paper?
I hadn't thought that far ahead.
Oh, God.
You gotta get me out of this hell.
I have some Purell,
but I don't think that's gonna...
Hello?
Hello?
-No phones on my hunt.
-Great! That's just great!
What do we do now
if there's an actual emergency?
Relax. You're the expert.
I will have you know,
I have low blood sugar
and we haven't eaten
since we've been out here.
I could get light-headed.
You're hungry?
Why didn't you say so?
Here.
There.
It's protein. It's okay.
Are you mad?
You better pick that up.
Your breakfast is getting away.
I've lost my appetite.
Have it your way. I just wouldn't want you
to die of light-headedness.
You owe me an iPhone.
-[Maynard] That'll be one dollar.
-A dollar?
Unbelievable. Five bucks in the city.
I'll buy a bunch of these before we leave.
When is that gonna be, actually?
Well, if they don't find something
tonight, he's outta there.
He's not gonna make it
another night. No way.
And then this whole trip
will have been a bust.
We got some footage.
We can't air a show
without any Bigfoot evidence
and him running around
looking scared out of his mind.
Thank you.
Let's go.
[Bart] Good evening, Jack.
You've been sleeping all day,
and he's been sulking all day.
Here you go, Jack.
Come on over here. All is forgiven.
He knows you didn't mean to shoot him.
Why don't you tell us all about Bigfoot?
Who knows?
It may help us to catch him. Come on.
-You have any of that moonshine left?
-If a snake had ears would you screw it?
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.
You wanna hang out,
have a couple of beers?
I don't think I'm in the mood.
Why don't you come over?
We'll watch a movie and make popcorn.
I'm not up for a movie tonight.
Thanks, though.
You sure?
I make a mean Jiffy Pop.
I know you do, I just....
It's been a long couple of weeks,
you know?
Rain check?
Any time.
Night, May.
Night, Park.
Oh, hey...
You mind?
Of course not.
[slurring] Are you trying to tell me
that Bigfoot is really an alien?
No. Not...
[slurring]
Not just an alien...
an alien criminal...
who has been dropped
and left on this planet
as punishment for his crimes.
Are you trying to say that Earth
is like a prison for Bigfoot?
Exactly.
-It's a prison for Bigfoot.
-Exactly.
It's a prison.
The whole thing is a prison.
So when we catch him, Jack,
you're gonna have to read him his rights.
Mr. Television Man,
may I ask a couple of questions?
Of course, mate.
Bigfoot's paws...
What differentiates
Bigfoot's paws from other animals?
Yeah, the...
He's asking about the...
-Bigfoot's paws.
-Yeah.
Bigfoot scat.
You ever find any of that?
That must be really interesting.
-Scat?
-Scat.
-Scat?
-Scat.
I'm so glad you asked me
about the scat, because...
Nickel for all the times school children
asked me about the scat.
I guess I would say about the scat...
The scat is my favorite part of the job.
You know, put my hands in it.
I get right in there.
Yeah.
[eerie noises]
I'm a bit drunk,
but that is definitely not a coyote.
I have no idea what that was.
-Maybe that's our Squatch.
-Wait a minute.
Only one way to find out.
What day is this?
Hey, Bart. Hey, Brock.
Hey, guys?
May? May, I know your secret.
May?
May?
Get that out of my face.
Come on.
Guys...
What the devil is happening out here?
Probably a UFO dropping off
Bigfoot prisoners.
Sweet Yowie, how many monsters
you got in these woods?
Hey guys, there's nothing there.
Let's go back.
It's obviously something.
It got our attention,
you can bet your butt it got Bigfoot's.
That's why I wanna go back,
because if Bigfoot's...
Jack, you're not making sense.
I've gotta film this for my show.
Bart, come on...
Oh, hell.
[sounds getting louder]
What the...?
Welcome to our first annual
Squatch Watch Spirit Gathering.
Your what?
Oh, no. Quit that, lady.
-[Bart] Quit that!
-We're here to see Bigfoot.
-[furries] We love Bigfoot.
-[Bart] You people, you have to go.
-[furries] We love Bigfoot.
-You have to get out of here.
Do your loving somewhere else.
Jack, come over her. Help me out.
All right, folks.
My friend here is right.
This is not really the time,
definitely not the place for the...
Feels kind of amazing.
Jack, moonshine and tranquilizer
is not a good combination.
Get the hell away from me.
-[woman] He's one of us.
-One of us.
[furries]
One of us.
I wanna be your fuzzy little joey.
[chanting]
One of us.
What the hell is "one of us"?
-We're furries.
-What the hell's a furry?
A furry is a person.
They're people...
who just happen to like to dress up
in furry clothes
and rub up against each another.
And I'll tell you something else, Bart...
I'm a furry, okay,
and I'm damn proud of it!
[gunshot]
Okay. That's it! Out of here!
[Connie]
But, we love Bigfoot.
Lady, once I have Bigfoot
stuffed and mounted,
you're welcome to rub up against him
all you want.
But until then, get your
skinny little chicken ass out of here.
She's a bunny, Bart.
She's a bunny!
-What?
-She's a bunny.
It doesn't work as a chicken.
She's a bunny!
Okay, then hop it on out of here.
Go on!
I'm gonna count to ten.
One...
If you wanna come to the next meeting,
just let me know.
I will.
I will and I do and I will.
Come on! Out!
Come on!
Now, as for you two.
Was that a real gun you shot back there?
Yep, and I'll use it again
if either one of you tries
to get into this tent tonight.
Do your thing, Mr. Television Man.
What thing?
You know, that howling,
yodeling thing you do.
I thought you said it was stupid.
No, it's perfect.
You hear something?
Just shut up and do it.
Jack, you stay here.
I need you to film me.
Okay.
-Okay.
-Keep that right on me.
-Right.
-This is my good side.
Stay on the face.
Stay on my face.
He's out there.
He's definitely out there.
He's getting closer.
[yodels]
[Bigfoot screams]
Sorry.
Did I get him?
Did I get him?
Did I get him?
Yeah, you got him.
You got him, all right.
Hey, Pottersville, I found Bigfoot!
Follow me!
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Bigfoot can be seen by the stars.
Monster found!
Pick up, pick up.
Come on, May, pick up the phone.
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you are about to witness
is not just television history....
it's also scientific history.
It's also world history.
It may, in fact, be the most significant
event in the history of mankind.
Because I have managed to do
what no one else ever could.
Which is capture
the world's most elusive beast.
Without further ado, I present...
Bigfoot.
Maynard!
Maynard!
Maynard.
Maynard.
What did you do to him?
I caught him. That's my job, isn't it?
-This isn't Bigfoot!
-Of course it is.
Is this really what you do for a living?
This is Maynard Greiger.
He runs the general store.
Maynard.
-Maynard.
-Shit.
It's okay, Park. He's gonna be all right.
I just popped him
with a tranquilizer dart.
Was that you in the forest
this entire time?
Maynard, are you okay?
So, this is all a big hoax?
Cameras off!
-Hey...
-This is a big hoax, isn't it?
Do you know who I am?
This was gonna be my biggest show ever!
It was gonna make me a star!
Well, guess what?
I am gonna sue Pottersville.
How do you like that?
That's right. You'll be ruined!
I don't care if a colony of Bigfoot
moves in and builds houses,
and starts raising their kids
and marching their kids back and forth
to school across the square every day,
and singing karaoke at the karaoke bar!
No one's ever gonna see it!
Because from now on,
Pottersville will be known as a town
of fakes and phonies...
and freaks.
G'day, morons.
Did somebody say they
needed a Bigfoot?
Well, nice work, Maynard,
now the whole town is gonna get sued.
There goes Christmas.
And we can all kiss
a Happy New Year goodbye.
I ought to stick a "big foot" up your ass.
Hey, little bunny.
I was thinking maybe
I can come over later and...
I'd love for you to come by tomorrow,
Maynard, and pack your stuff and leave.
We all just wanted to meet Bigfoot,
and you made us look like
a bunch of idiots.
I'm sorry.
[Bart]
You okay, pal?
[Gutierrez]
So you will be seeking legal action?
[Brock] That's right, yeah.
It's the opposite of a class-action suit,
because it's me against 80 people.
It's like un-classy suit.
It's not what you call it,
but I'm suing for damages, yeah.
[Gutierrez]
I have heard a number, an estimate,
somewhere in the ballpark
of 150 million dollars in damages.
Is that what you will be seeking?
[Brock]
I couldn't say, and I won't say.
I'm not allowed to say,
but that's accurate, yes.
I can't promise you anybody's gonna
show up, I mean, people are pretty upset.
But you know his heart
was in the right place.
Yeah. Well, I'll do my best.
Hi. Is there a Maynard Greiger here?
[Parker]
I don't get it.
Don't you know how much he loves you,
how much he loves this town?
Maynard's family has owned and operated
the general store for generations.
He's over there right now,
packing up his shop because...
he doesn't know what else to do.
He feels like he doesn't belong here.
Well, he did ruin our shot.
Your shot at what?
Fame, fortune. Being on TV.
And how did he ruin it, exactly?
By pretending to be Bigfoot.
How much Bigfoot merchandise
did you sell out of his store?
Did you ever offer him anything?
Did he ever ask for anything in return?
He's given everything to Pottersville.
I mean everything.
He's tried so hard to keep us
and this town afloat that, honestly,
I don't know if he could afford
to keep his store open
even if he felt like you wanted him to.
You've all seen this.
You know what it's for.
And at one time or another,
when you were down on your luck,
each and every one of you asked Maynard
to put your name in this book.
Has he ever refused any of you?
Now when he needs our help,
your answer is to turn your back on him?
Well, before you decide
that he ruined your shot,
or your Christmas, or your Happy New Year,
I just want you to take a look at this.
Then you can tell me if you're still
upset with him for pretending.
It's empty.
Yeah.
{\an8}Now we go live to Stacy Gutierrez
{\an8}for a story you'll only find here
on Channel 13 News. Stacy.
Thank you, John.
Hi, this is Stacy Gutierrez
reporting live on Christmas Eve
here in Pottersville,
but all is not merry and bright
as the town is still reeling
from the Bigfoot hoax.
Well, I am here with the hoaxster himself,
Maynard Greiger,
to get his side of the story.
So, Mr. Greiger, why did you do it?
Well, I never meant
for it to happen, really.
But when people started really thinking
I was Bigfoot
and I saw how happy it made them,
I figured, why not?
Why do you think this town
was so captivated by him?
I don't think it's just our town, really.
I mean, it could be any town.
People everywhere are looking for
something to believe in.
We had fallen on hard times,
like a lot of other places...
this magical sense of... well, Bigfoot,
you know, that sense that
something else was out there.
It really brought the town together.
I haven't seen this town
so alive in a long time, and...
It seemed to give everybody the faith
and hope that things were gonna be okay.
I guess that's why I did it.
If you had to do it all over again,
would you?
You know, let's just say that hope
isn't always the most realistic thing,
but it tends to make the world
a better place.
Thank you, Mr. Greiger.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you.
This is Stacy Gutierrez
live from Pottersville.
Thank you, Mr. Greiger, that was great.
My pleasure. You're welcome.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I have some friends
who want to talk to you.
Hey, fellas.
What's going on?
Thanks for letting us
sell our stuff out of your store.
And thank you also for just... well...
Oh, what the hell.
You're welcome.
Hey, Tammy.
I'm sorry I was so hard on you, Maynard.
Hey. Yeah, we've gotta
get back on the air.
There's another breaking story
happening here now.
You could never ruin our Christmas.
Thanks, Doris.
Maynard, forget the things I said.
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Maynard, I'm so sorry I said
I'd put my foot up your ass.
It's okay, Millie.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Millie.
-Hey, Maynard.
-Jasper.
Thanks for everything, man.
Yeah. Sure.
-Hey.
-Yeah?
You thought you had
to become Bigfoot to save this town,
but you saved it a long time ago
by just being you.
Hi, this is Stacy Gutierrez
reporting live on Christmas Eve
from Greiger's General Store
here in Pottersville,
where the entire community has turned out
in a show of support
for the one-time Bigfoot hoaxster
Maynard Greiger,
to receive him now as their hometown hero.
Hey, buddy.
It's truly a Christmas miracle.
Hi. Thanks, Maynard.
-Merry Christmas, Maynard.
-Merry Christmas.
-Hey.
-Hey.
What are you doing later?
I think you should close up
and come home.
You can bring the Bigfoot costume.
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.
I know you have.
You were right.
I know, baby.
Your little bunny's always right.
No, you were right...
We should split up.
Excuse me?
You should be happy.
You should go and find
whatever excitement you can in life,
if that's what you want.
I get it.
Life is short.
Why not be happy?
That's all I wanted to tell you.
I don't...
Wait. Are you...?
This is it?
[Connie scoffs]
Hey, Parker, is that rain check
still available for the Jiffy Pop?
Always.
To Maynard Greiger...
the richest man in Pottersville.
[all] Hear, hear.
Hey. Norm? Tony?
You say people all over the world
love this Bigfoot, right?
Um, yeah.
On every continent and in every language.
-All of them.
-Yeah.
All right.
[TV announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just received word
it appears that Brock Masterson,
host of Monster Finder,
is also not who he claims to be.
In an exclusive story you'll only see here
on Channel 13 News,
we've discovered that Brock Masterson
is actually one Leonard Abromowitz,
an actor from Coney Island.
Last time I checked,
that's nowhere near Australia.
Well, what do you know?
[Parker] Hey, you two.
What are you doing?
We're just here to meet Bill
on his lunch break.
This place is amazing, you two.
Thanks, Maynard!
-You bet ya.
-Have fun.
Thanks.
You're a good man, May.
Well, what are you gonna do?
[cheering]
