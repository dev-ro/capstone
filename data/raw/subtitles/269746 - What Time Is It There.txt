What Time Is It There?
Hsiao Kang!
Dad, we're going
through the tunnel.
You have to follow us, OK?
First bow.
Second bow.
Third bow.
Try it on if you want.
Do you have dual-time watches?
These two rows
and the diving range over there.
The one on your wrist is nice.
Is it a dual-time?
Yeah.
Is it available?
Out of stock.
Can I look at it?
Would you sell it to me?
I can't.
Come on. How much?
These aren't bad.
Look at them again.
Sell me this one.
I'm going abroad.
Call me later.
I'll try to get you one.
Come on. Sell me this one.
It'd be bad luck
to own my watch.
Why?
Someone in my family just died.
I'm in mourning.
I can't sell it to you.
How do you open this?
Hello. Is that you? Mr. Lee?
Good afternoon. I was
at your stall this afternoon.
I'm the one
who likes your watch so much.
I'd really like to buy it.
Won't you sell it to me?
Hello?
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you, sir.
No, it won't!
I know it won't
bring me bad luck.
That'll be too late.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Please. Sell it to me.
Sir...
I swear it doesn't matter.
I'm a Christian.
How much?
You're kidding, right?
How much really?
It should be all right.
Thanks.
Sir, I'm here for the watch.
Here's 1,000 yuan.
- I'm giving you 30% off.
- That's nice.
- Does it have a battery?
- Yes.
And you set the time here.
- Where are you going?
- Paris.
- Paris?
- France.
Take this.
- What is it?
- A cake.
Bow three times.
First bow.
Second bow.
Third bow.
To the departed.
First bow.
Second bow.
Third bow.
This is yin-yang water.
"Yin-yang water"?
It's a blend of half-cold,
half-boiled water.
I cast a spell on it.
I place it on the altar.
If he comes back,
he'll drink it.
Observe the water level,
and you will know.
Check these out.
Backlit.
And unbreakable. Sells
really well. Start with ten.
Don't go overboard.
- What?
- A cockroach.
Stop. Don't kill it.
It could be
your father's reincarnation.
You're crazy.
Eat some duck.
Didn't the priest tell you...
not to harm any living creature
for forty-nine days?
You never listen.
Take these after your meal.
Drugs are expensive, you know.
Hello?
What number can I dial
to know the time abroad?
Yes. Thank you.
Hello?
I'd like to know
what time it is in Paris.
What is the time now in Paris?
OK.
So it's seven hours behind,
right?
Great. Thank you very much.
Yes?
- Can I help you?
- Do you have any French films?
French films? Sure.
Action? Detective?
Any particular director?
We specialize in movie classics.
Do you have anything on Paris?
Films on Paris? Of course.
"Hiroshima Mon Amour"...
"The 400 Blows," too.
Take a look.
Got any Yu Ming films?
Yu Ming, Lin Dai, and
Grace Chang movies are there.
I don't see
"Moon, Stars, and Sun."
You're right. Not today.
- Maybe in a day or two.
- A day or two?
Hsiao Kang.
What?
Come here.
Come, quick.
Come on.
Look.
Look at the time. It's strange.
Really strange.
It must be him coming back.
Don't touch anything.
It must be your father.
He wants me to cook for him.
I wonder if he wants more duck.
Pray!
A listener tells us
there's a big hairy dog...
hanging out on the expressway.
Maybe that mutt's getting a tan,
lazing around on the asphalt.
So please, fellow drivers,
honk if you see him.
Remind that dog
this is no beach.
Anyway, just keep cool
and avoid it.
Be careful while you do it.
Don't do anything stupid.
Now I have to
go after a driver out there.
In the tunnel heading
towards the Palace Museum...
there's something weird,
like some big stuff off a truck.
So, Mr. Trucker,
what's gotten into you?
Don't you realize?
What if it hit a car?
Elsewhere, on Jen-Ai Road,
in Section Four...
fellow listeners are reporting
a lot of double-parking.
We've already called the
traffic police to tow them away.
Oh!
Remember what I was saying,
near the Woo-Ku interchange...
about that big dog
lounging on the expressway?
A listener, Mr. Huang,
just called in.
I guess some guy
who wasn't tuned in earlier...
couldn't avoid the dog in time.
Anyway, Mr. Huang
says the dog is...
Well, anyway...
And now, a safety reminder
to all of you...
Is this dinner
or supper or what?
You're eating or not?
So we have dinner
at midnight now?
What do you know?
Can't we go along
with your dad's time?
Don't you dare waste this.
Is that you
coming back to see me?
It's so hard.
Do you miss me?
Well, I don't agree!
Absolutely not!
What do you mean, "What now?"
Screw you!
I don't give a fuck!
I'll shout if I want to.
I don't give a fuck!
Call who the hell you like!
This has gone too far!
Well, I don't agree.
I won't tell you again.
Your attention, please. There
has been a serious incident.
Would passengers
please alight from the train?
We apologize
for any inconvenience.
Is there a blackout?
What are you up to?
He's afraid of the light.
Too much light
and he won't come back.
The fish will die
if you cut the power.
Get out of my way.
I told you to move.
- Don't be absurd.
- What are you doing?
I told you to leave me alone.
- What are you doing?
- Get down!
Get down!
What are you doing?
Please stop, OK?
I told you,
he's afraid of the light.
Don't you understand?
You're completely nuts.
What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?
- Stop it right now.
Can't you let him
come back in peace?
Let me keep house
the way he likes. Get out!
Go away and let me be.
Stop putting that up.
Go away!
Get lost!
Did you hear me?
Get lost!
Could you please stop?
Your dad wants to come home,
and you won't let him.
What are you thinking?
Get out of here!
OK, go ahead.
Cover whatever you want.
Get away from me.
Are you looking for something?
It's hot.
Excuse me...
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Where are you from?
Taiwan.
Oh, Taiwan.
I've been there. It's fun.
All those good little dishes.
- And you?
- From Hong Kong.
Are you also a tourist?
Kind of.
Are you feeling better?
How do you feel?
So-so. I had too much coffee.
- Did you drink a lot?
- I drink coffee every day.
Me, too, but I get dizzy
if I drink too much.
Though, when I'm in Paris,
I just can't help it.
Are you staying nearby?
Yes.
Me, too.
Near the Louvre, over there.
I'm in the third arrondissement.
The third?
That's not very close.
Near "Bonne Nouvelle."
Lots of clothing shops.
Really? I have to
check it out, then.
To my father
and Lee Kang-Sheng's father.
Tsai Ming-Liang.
