BASED ON A TRUE STORY
Alright! Keep focus!
Ladies and gentlemen,
soon they'll tour the world
with their spectacular show.
Please welcome the 2012
National Danish Gymnastics Team.
Whoo-hoo!
Ah!
Hi, Daniel. We miss you.
We're about to get on the plane.
It's weird being here without you.
Best wishes. We'll see you. Bye!
Just move to Copenhagen with me.
Why wouldn't you?
You don't even have room
for your couch in that apartment.
Oh, come on. That's a terrible reason.
Of course there's room.
You'd go crazy having me
and my stupid leg around all the time.
-Plus, you'll be studying all day.
-You'd find something to do too.
Such as? I have no qualifications.
It's so frustrating. I trained
for six years, and it was all for nothing.
{\an8}--That was out!
{\an8}HEDEGAARD, DENMARK
{\an8}-It was not, Grandpa.
- It was out.
- You're cheating.
- No.
Daniel, will you be the referee?
Sure. It was totally out.
-What?
-Yes!
- Maybe he'll go back to school.
- He wants to be a photographer.
-It's something he's always wanted.
-It won't earn him a living, Mom.
Why are you always so mad at Daniel?
I'm not mad at anyone. But you're not
doing him any favors by coddling him.
He's 23, isn't he?
Does he even pay you rent?
Yes, he pays 80,000 kroner a month
plus utilities, Anita.
-I paid to live here when I turned 18.
-Daniel doesn't get student grants.
That's right. You don't get that when
you do cartwheels instead of studying.
Shut up. You're so annoying.
- Would you set the table?
- Nope.
Great!
-Did you look into photography schools?
-No. It doesn't pay to go to school.
You're too good already?
No, but an apprenticeship would be better.
-More ham, anyone?
-Yes, please. Thank you.
-You'll have to watch your diet now.
-As if you've ever done that.
- Don't be cheeky. I'm just saying.
- Thanks, Dad. That's great advice.
You're welcome.
I'm here for you any time. Watch it.
How many photographers did you call?
- Just get off my ass, Anita.
- Don't talk to me like that.
So stop. You know there are
no photographers around here.
-"Get off my ass."
-Stop! We don't talk like that.
- Stop.
- I won't have it.
What about going to Aarhus?
Or is that too far for His Majesty?
-Cut it out, Anita.
-Mom does everything for you two.
And now she'll be waiting
on him hand and foot for another year.
Oh, shut up. How about trying
your luck on farmerdating.com?
-Hilarious.
-Or find a plumber to clean your pipes?
-You're hilarious.
-Mm.
If you really want to know, I plan on
moving to Copenhagen with Signe.
- To Copenhagen?
- Yeah.
Take care.
There you go.
- Can you grab this one too?
- Yes.
And this one too. Here you go.
I'll take this one.
When you're done studying, we'll find
work, get married and have kids.
We'll find a bigger place and buy a new
car every four years like your parents.
We'll go on vacations
and do our thing until we retire and die.
Well, it sure sucks
when you say it like that.
-But that's how it is.
-Of course it is.
And that's really sad.
Hello?
-How did you get in?
-The door was open.
I'm Daniel Rye. I'm interviewing
for the job as photo assistant.
It's just that we had an appointment
-and all the other places I went--
-Yeah. Yeah, hey.
Show me your portfolio.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit.
You fix it.
No, you-- you do it.
I pay you, okay?
Your portraits are boring as hell, but
your street photographs have something.
-Right. Well, I do actually prefer--
-Yeah.
Hang on.
-Do you have a passport?
-Yeah.
Well, uh, just forget about it.
I just found an assistant.
So, see you in Mogadishu.
-Sorry?
-It's unnatural, a flying pile of iron.
Right.
{\an8}MOGADISHU, SOMALIA
Are you alright?
Yeah. They're so young, just boys.
In terms of war, they're veterans.
We've only paid half up front,
so if we don't survive,
at least we'll save a lot of money.
Just put it there. I don't need you
right now. Go shoot some pictures.
This is what I want to do
my whole life, Signe.
I'm more certain than I've ever been.
Okay. How drunk are you?
I'm not. Well, maybe I'm moderately
intoxicated, but I know this is it.
-Sleep it off and come back home.
-Right. Love you.
 It's important to show people
what's going on there.
- Syria?
- Yes.
I'll document how civilians live
amid the conflict.
The everyday lives
that keep going despite the war.
-It's dangerous.
-I'm not going to Aleppo.
I'll go to a small town near the border.
It's far away from the fighting.
-What does your boss say?
-He's letting me take time off.
This is my idea.
I won't stay in the same place too long,
and I'll go back to Turkey every night.
That's where I'll sleep.
Like the reporters I've talked to.
I just need a little extra money
for the flight and the hotel.
Oh?
- So maybe you could buy the Taunus?
- You're selling your car?
It's just collecting parking tickets
in Copenhagen.
-How will you come visit us?
-Mom.
Daniel, I don't know.
What do you think, Kjeld?
Well… what did you expect to get for it?
Well, 20,000… or 18,000?
It's not even worth 10,000.
The undercarriage is rusty.
-Just buy the damn car. How about 15,000?
-Yeah.
-14,000? Daddy…
-Nope.
I'll give you 12,000 kroner
if you fill up the tank.
-I'll pay for the gas.
-Jeez…
- Deal.
- What a haggler.
Next.
Thanks.
{\an8}BAB AL-SALAMEH, SYRIA
Daniel!
Hey!
-Come in, I am Aya.
-I'm Daniel, nice to meet you.
- Come on, jump in.
- Yeah.
This is Naim, our guard.
He will be with us for protection.
He's from the Free Syrian Army,
and he doesn't speak English.
- This is our driver, Mohamad.
- Hello.
Don't worry, I can get you everywhere.
I have connections in ar-Raqqa,
and also the frontlines in Aleppo.
You see, I used to be a nurse there.
I know the town inside out.
I think you can get great shots
of the shootings.
No, no, I want to go to the town close
to the border.
- Azaz?
- Yeah. That's perfect.
I'm not looking for fighting or soldiers.
I'm looking for like everyday people
living their everyday lives.
There was fighting in Azaz,
but there are still some people
who live there,
so I can definitely help you
with the families.
-Daniel.
-Ah.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you, um…
Yeah, yes, yes.
Hello.
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Sure, go ahead.
This is the barbershop.
-Take some photos.
-Is it alright?
-Yes.
-Come on.
Thank you.
Are they selling the stones?
Yes.
- What are you doing here?
- He's a photographer.
You shouldn't be here.
We are in charge here.
Hand over your weapon.
We have a permit.
-Open the bus.
-We have a permit.
Who gave it to you? It wasn't me!
We are in charge here.
- Get on the bus!
- But we've got a permit.
We always get here without any permit.
Get the hell out of here.
Get on the bus. Come with me.
-It's okay, it's okay.
-Let's go.
-Get on the bus. Let's go!
-It is a misunderstanding--
Mohammad, go get Aymen.
Get in! Get in!
Get in! Get in!
How dare you bring a foreign
photographer here without permission?
-We have a permit from the Free Army.
-They have no authority anymore.
I'll take you to issue a permit.
What's happening?
Nothing,
just Arabs trying to be macho.
They say we have to go to the authorities
to get a permit to take pictures.
This happens all the time, Daniel.
What do you mean, happens all the time?
How are we going to get back to Turkey?
My friend Aymen, here in Azaz.
He will help us.
He is on his way to us now.
Okay? You will be safe.
Get out. In there. Hurry up.
-We need a photo permit.
-He can't take his camera inside.
-Give me the camera.
-No, no, no.
Give me the camera.
- It's okay.
- No.
Give me the camera. Now!
Here it's. Open the door. Hurry up!
Hurry up!
- Move it!
- It's okay.
Get in here. Sit down. You too.
It's okay, Andy.
Don't do anything.
- Where are the passports?
- Here.
You brought a foreigner
without permission?
-I talked with the Free Army.
-They have no authority here.
-They're the actual authority.
-Shut up!
Don't argue with me. You're at fault.
What are you doing here?
I'm a photographer from Denmark.
I will make a story
about the civilian Syrians.
Hi.
I'm a friend of Aya's.
We got a permit yesterday.
He is here to take pictures of the war.
We believe you, but we must be careful.
They are all infidels!
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
They place tracking devices in people's
cars so the warplanes can bomb it.
He isn't like that.
- They aren't Muslims!
- He's just a Danish photographer.
- Aymen!
- Sit!
- Sit!
- Are you okay?
Get up.
Where are you taking him?
What are you going to do?
- It doesn't concern you.
- You have no right!
- Walk.
- We got a permit.
This way. Keep walking.
What are you going to do with him?
Stay out of this.
Don't look back!
Quit it!
Just do what they say!
Don't look.
He's a spy.
{\an8}ALEPPO, SYRIA
-Let's go.
-Get up.
What's your name?
Uh, Daniel. Dan-- Daniel Rye.
Where are you from?
I'm from Denmark.
This is a misunderstanding.
Hello, Daniel.
- Hello.
- Do you know who I am?
I've come to make you tell us the truth.
I am telling you the truth.
I promise.
It's okay.
Thank you.
We already know who you are.
Good. Then can I please call home
and tell them--
Shush. Don't speak now.
We know the truth already,
but we want you to tell it to us yourself.
What do you mean? I-- That's--
Hey!
Wait.
Please.
I am-- I'm telling you the truth.
Tell us what you know!
Tell us now!
Ah! Please.
Okay, what is your real name?
Daniel. Daniel.
Again, I ask.
What is your real name?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm Daniel!
Where is this?
CIA training camp?
No, this is my--
This is my gymnastics team.
We just perform for the military.
Like I told you, I'm a gymnast.
You're a liar. You've been trained.
-You are a CIA soldier.
-No, I--
I'm a gymnast. Look, look.
Do more.
Do more!
You sound like a donkey, Daniel.
And now you look like one too.
See?
Make the donkey sound, Daniel. Come on.
Daniel the donkey! Donkey!
- What is it?
- He wasn't on the plane.
-You're sure?
-It landed long ago. He wasn't there.
Alright.
I'll talk to Kjeld and call you back.
We should report it, right? He's left
a bunch of papers in case of an emergency.
There's a number
for a security expert called Arthur.
Right, text me his number.
-I'll call him, Signe.
-Okay.
-We'll talk later. Bye.
-Yeah.
{\an8}SYRIA, NEAR THE TURKISH BORDER
-Peace be with you, Ahmad.
-And also with you.
Where's Kadir?
He was meeting a man
who had information about James Foley.
We were at a checkpoint,
and suddenly they fired at us.
I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry,
but he knew it was dangerous.
And James Foley?
Nothing.
They went to Aleppo last Monday
and no one saw James, but…
…but they saw two Italian journalists.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Please give this to Kadir's family.
For the funeral expenses.
You are an honorable man, Arthur.
Thank you.
-Hello?
-Hello, my name is Susanne Rye.
-Yes?
-I'm Daniel Rye's mother.
-When did you last hear from him?
-Five days ago.
But the phone service might be down,
and we hoped he'd be on the flight.
Okay, Susanne.
You can't tell anyone about this.
-How many people know he's gone?
-My husband, Kjeld, who is here now.
-And me and his girlfriend, Signe.
-Okay. Let's keep it that way.
- It needs to stay a secret.
- -We won't tell anyone.
I'll call you.
-We have to go too.
-Goodbye.
- Weren't you going out?
- Dad had a headache.
Yeah, it's still very bad.
Didn't you have a party?
Yeah, I'm getting changed
and going to Camille's.
-Are you here for dinner?
-I said I'm leaving.
-Right.
-That's what you said.
Weirdos.
I'll inform Danish Intelligence
and the Foreign Ministry.
But don't expect any help.
-Why not?
-Daniel has probably been kidnapped.
Denmark has a rock-solid policy
against negotiating with terrorists.
They'll be able to advise you,
unofficially.
But they won't get involved.
-What can we do to get him out quickly?
-We need to find out who has him.
I have people in Syria already, looking
for an American journalist, James Foley.
Our experience in Syria is
that any publicity can hurt the hostages.
Why?
They want to look like holy warriors,
not just common criminals.
You'll need to keep all channels
of communication open.
Phone, email and social media,
just in case they contact you.
If it happens, I'll take over.
Hmm.
Uh, sorry. Food, water.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Jamal!
Come here!
Jamal, come here!
I'm sorry. Eat.
Hi!
Hey, hello.
There's someone here, dad!
Can you help me?
Can you please, please help me?
I need to get to the Turkish border.
-Do you have a car?
-Yes.
Can you take me there, please? Please.
Please, across the Turkish border to, uh--
You can get money for me
if you take me across.
Please.
Please, do you have a car?
Wash up.
You can wash up here.
Wash up. Here is the soap.
Get some food and clothes, boys.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
They did this-- this to me.
You know, torture.
And this.
Please, help.
Help. Thanks.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. God will reward you.
You've done the right thing, brothers.
I'll… go study at Pernille's.
I'm also eating at her place.
-Okay, Christina.
-I'll walk you out.
Chrissy, what's wrong with Mom and Dad?
They're acting strange.
-No more than usual, are they?
-I think so. Did something happen?
Nothing ever happens here. You've
just forgotten how lame this place is.
- See you. Bye.
- Right. Bye-bye.
Can you put the crossword away?
It's not a crossword. It's a sudoku.
Oh.
Why are you looking
at your phone all the time?
-What's going on?
-Nothing. We're relaxing. It's Sunday.
Mom?
Mom, is Dad sick? Is it cancer?
Dad? No, nobody's sick.
-Are you getting a divorce?
-Of course not.
It's Daniel.
He never came back from Syria.
-He's in Copenhagen.
-No, Anita.
He disappeared.
We don't know where he is.
What the hell are you talking about?
I talked to Signe last--
- We're all lying! We can't say anything.
- We think he's alive, but we--
Are you insane? How could you not tell me?
-What about Christina?
-She's busy. We can't tell anyone.
-Who told you that?
-We hired someone.
-The police can't help.
-Who did you hire?
He's ex-military.
His name is Arthur.
A specialist in hostage situations.
{\an8}KILIS, TURKEY
NEAR THE SYRIAN BORDER
Hello, Aya. How are you?
I want you to know
that I had nothing to do with this.
What can you tell us?
I'm sorry… I'm so sorry for Daniel.
I thought it was safe.
They said they're Mujahedin,
but I haven't seen them before.
They must have taken over the area.
They tortured my friend.
They almost killed me too.
I barely made it back.
Who were they?
I only heard them mention one name.
Abu Suheib?
You have to help me get out of Kilis.
I can't go back to Syria.
-I'm no longer safe.
-I'll help you.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Richard just told me
that U.S. intelligence intercepted a call
about a hostage transport,
two days after Daniel disappeared.
Mm, where to?
Most likely Aleppo, but it's unconfirmed.
Well, many groups operate in Aleppo,
but Emir Abu Athir is the one in control.
But Abu Suheib's people control Azaz,
and that's where Daniel was taken.
Maybe they work together.
That's what I've been saying.
The groups are starting to collaborate.
Abu Suheib is the key.
Should I buy a meeting?
It will cost us a quarter notebook.
Twenty-five grand.
I think it's too dangerous
to cross over right now.
We already lost Kadir.
Let's just stay here and focus on Foley.
There's nothing new on Foley, Arthur.
Richard keeps saying
we should look to Damascus.
Yeah, well, nobody knows a thing.
It's like Foley never existed.
Let me go into Syria, see what I can do.
At least there's something
we can work with there.
You know it takes time
to arrange a meeting.
I'll bring Ahmad with me.
Okay. Let's do it.
{\an8}RAQQA, SYRIA
This Dane is in bad condition.
He might have typhoid.
Get the water hose.
It's fucking disgusting.
There's shit all over him.
Oh, he fucking stinks.
Don't let him drink.
He'll just shit himself again.
Use that.
If you shit yourself again, you die.
You hear that?
Take him to the cell.
Move!
Move to corner.
Don't go toilet where I pray.
Sorry. Sorry.
Welcome to our room.
You have to be careful with those wounds.
I am Jeremy.
You probably can't hear it,
as I have absolutely no accent,
but I'm French.
Journalist.
What is your name?
I'm Daniel.
You look like you've been
here a while, Daniel.
Here. I am Luis.
A journalist from France, like Jeremy.
Lie on this.
The floor is cold.
{\an8}SYRIA, NEAR THE TURKISH BORDER
Peace be with you.
It's okay, Omar.
-Peace be with you.
-And with you.
This is the new iPhone.
But the numbers on it are too small.
It's made for a woman's hand,
not a man's.
Thank you for taking
the time to see me, Abu Suheib.
-It is very generous of you.
-How can I help you?
Daniel Rye. I want to bring him back home.
No way.
He confessed that he's CIA.
He will be executed.
Daniel was just a young man
who didn't know what he got himself into.
How much will they pay for him?
His parents are common people.
So let the government pay for him.
Ten notebooks and an ambulance.
That's my price.
I'm sure you know
the Danish government's policy.
Then you're wasting my time.
I should kill you both.
Seven notebooks. That's my final offer.
I also need information about
the American journalist, James Foley.
Impossible. I can't help you with that.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
What are they demanding?
700,000 dollars.
700,000 dollars?
But that's… Well, the rate is 6.5?
About 4.3 million Danish kroner.
That's much more than the insurance.
Obviously, it's your decision, Kjeld.
But on behalf of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, I would advise
against making any rash decisions
based on so little evidence.
Can we trust Abu Suheib?
Abu Suheib is a busy man.
He likely considers Daniel small fry.
That's our chance.
Before you make a decision,
I must tell you that ransoms
are often up for negotiation.
No, this figure can't be negotiated.
I know that's hard to accept,
but we have a unique opportunity.
We can't miss it.
I'll press Abu Suheib for a proof of life.
Is there something only Daniel knows,
or does he have a scar or birthmark?
Hands on the wall!
Daniel, look away.
Food is ready.
Take this.
Thanks.
Everyone here is afraid of you,
because they see in you what
will happen to themselves in time.
That's Arwel from Wales.
Wojceik and Raul.
And Alexei you already met.
We think he's from Kosovo.
The only Muslim here.
He doesn't speak much.
And this is Hans.
He hasn't spoken for four weeks.
They are just normal people, like us.
European journalists and aid workers.
The guards are not so bad, are they?
Uh, the British guys?
I don't know where you come from, but…
…they're sadistic maniacs.
We call them The Beatles.
The guy with the perfume smell,
that's John.
The small one, Ringo.
Paul, he's a preacher. Teaches Islam.
George stabbed a man the day we arrived.
But I'd say John is the worst.
Hurry up!
Lean against the wall.
Again.
Good. Good.
What was the color of the car
you sold your dad?
-What?
-What was the color of the car
-you sold your dad?
-Green.
Green. It was apple green.
Did you talk to my dad?
Well, as mentioned, we have
our first proof-of-life, a picture.
There.
We brought Hanne here today.
She's our crisis psychologist.
-He's so thin.
-Right.
There, there.
Right.
As you can see,
his skin is relatively clean.
He seems able to focus.
That's very positive.
It means he's getting
reasonable amounts of water.
The bank has agreed to lend us
900,000 kroner against the house.
Susanne and I will cash out our pensions,
about a million kroner
of which we'll pay 60% in taxes.
-Anita will pay whatever she can.
-Yes.
I've talked
to the insurance company several times.
Unfortunately, the rest of the insurance
sum is earmarked for expenses.
At the current rate, we may scrape
together about 250,000 dollars.
- About a third of what they're asking.
- Yes.
Can't we offer them that?
250,000 dollars is a lot of money.
I know how this must feel, Susanne,
but offering less than the ransom,
will be seen as an insult.
What do you think?
It's your decision, Kjeld.
Yes.
It is, but the normal
procedure would be to negotiate.
There's no normal procedure with this.
The situation in Syria is unstable.
New groups are emerging all the time.
Some cooperate.
And they're aiming to create
an Islamic state.
They're driven by an unprecedented
hate, and they'll stop at nothing.
I would strongly advise you
to wait until you have the money.
Can't the government
lend the us money unofficially?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
This is absurd!
If he'd been caught
with cocaine in Bangkok
you'd do anything to get him home,
but when it's an innocent young man,
you're suddenly fucking useless!
-Anita!
-My God.
- I'm sorry. We can't change policy.
- Right.
I think we should offer them the 250,000.
It's better than nothing.
We can't let him stay there.
He's all skin and bones.
I agree. We have no choice.
Signe, are you leaving?
-Aren't we done?
-How about coffee?
Are you alright?
I'm just busy, and I don't sleep much.
Won't you talk to the other psychologist
that Arthur got you?
I do, but it doesn't help.
We only talk about me, about letting it
all out and moving on, but I can't.
Everything takes time. I don't have time!
I have exams constantly!
I'm sorry.
Your family's offer is an insult
to the Prophet, Daniel.
In 24 hours, you will look like him.
Why'd you come here in the first place?
How stupid are you?
Your government's at war
with the Islamic people.
Do you know how many innocent
Muslim lives they've taken?
-Huh?
-Please. I'm sorry.
No, Daniel.
You will hang here until you die.
And then we'll cut your head off
and send the video to your parents.
Do you understand?
Please just kill me now.
Just kill me now…
No, Daniel.
Here, you have to earn the right to die.
Come help me!
-Goodness me. Is this all for you?
-Yes.
-I'm sorry, I have to take this.
-But we're busy.
- I'm with a customer.
- We got an email.
They're very mad.
They want two million euro now.
If my understanding is correct.
That's 15 million kroner.
- Do they say how he is?
- No, they don't.
"Time is running out for Daniel.
He is unlikely to survive.
Confirm payment
of two million euro at once.
Our conditions are as follows.
No media coverage,
and the ransom must be paid in cash."
We can raise the money!
Someone will lend it to us.
We don't know anybody
who have that much money.
How do you propose
to raise the money, Anita?
We could have a fundraiser.
You can't tell people
what the money is for,
and a fundraising campaign
would be in a legal grey area at best.
Denmark doesn't negotiate with terrorists.
I don't give a damn what Denmark does.
This is my brother!
Lots of people have money
and want to help.
The gymnastics club is like his family.
They would never tell the press.
We can't just give up on him.
If it gets out, his chance of survival
worsens. Secrets are hard to keep.
But you know his chances are very slim
if we don't get the money.
Yes.
- Arthur.
- Yeah.
I need you to get in touch
with Abu Suheib's people right away.
-Yes.
-You have to make them understand
that the family is trying
to raise the two million euros,
but the contributors will only pay
if we are allowed to get
a video proof of life.
- So, we're buying time?
-Yeah, we are buying time.
-I'll take care of it.
-Okay.
Get out of the truck.
- Get out!
- Okay.
Go down the stairs.
Quickly!
- Name?
- James Foley.
- What's your name?
- William Johnson.
James Foley.
The great James Foley.
Let's welcome them.
Hey, what the fuck
you doing? Get down.
There's two new prisoners.
Enough.
Oh, shit.
You traitor!
Don't move.
Remember Abu Ghraib, James?
This is why this is happening to you.
- Jim.
- Luis, French.
- Jim.
- Hi, Jeremy.
Also French.
- Jim.
- Raul.
-Jim.
-Arwel. UK.
Oh. Hi. Jim.
- Wojceik.
- Ah.
Hi, I'm Jim.
-I'm Jim.
-Daniel.
-From Denmark.
-Ah, yeah.
I heard about you in Aleppo.
Ah, good.
Would anyone like a game of chess?
I'm not very good,
so you'll probably win.
But I like to play.
And I made a chessboard.
Anyone?
I have pieces.
Yeah, uh…
But I don't know the rules.
Oh.
Then I'll win.
At least the first time.
Okay, the king.
Very important.
And… queens.
Where's the Spaniard?
Congratulations. You're going home.
Take him.
The men are starving.
We need…
…more clothes and medicine.
Do you want to die right here?
William is sick.
If you want us to stay alive
we need food and water,
and antibiotics for his wounds.
No one's going to pay you
a ransom for dead people.
Do you agree with Foley, Jahash?
Answer me!
I…
Huh?
- Huh?
- I…
Yes.
Fool!
You two are going to die here.
Arwel too.
Your governments won't pay.
They spend millions on bombing Muslims,
but apparently their citizens
are worthless.
Enough.
Look at me.
Look at me.
If your family truly loves you,
you still have a chance, Jahash.
Unlike Foley.
Yeah, Foley's evil.
His conversion to Islam is a hoax.
He will die soon.
Are you okay?
It's okay. Come on.
What the hell was that about?
An animal impression?
Uh…
It's just something I do.
Uh…
They like it when I'm a donkey.
We told him he shouldn't do it.
Yeah, but if I don't, they'll kill me.
If they kill you
it's because no one's going to pay,
not because you refuse
to do a donkey impression.
Trust me.
Refuse next time.
Or at least don't be
so fucking good at it.
Be a less convincing donkey next time.
Nothing gave me meaning
like traveling
and telling people's stories.
I think my mom understood.
Everyone accepted it.
I'm sure it's the same
with your family too.
You know, after I broke my foot,
everything just slowed down.
It all became so predictable.
It was like…
…I could just see my life like…
-It all looked so--
-Boring.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's always a selfish motivation.
But that shouldn't stop us
from making a difference or trying, right?
If we don't dare to come here,
how would the world know what happens?
Yeah.
I keep thinking
about my parents all the time,
and my sisters, and Signe.
Yeah.
Try not to think about it.
I can't.
I mean, I've fucked up their lives too.
I've fucked up everything.
Our goal is to raise 15 million kroner.
But no matter how much we get,
we're more likely to bring Daniel home.
Everything is done anonymously
through our lawyer.
We only see the transfers, not the donors.
Since clubs and schools can't legally
provide money for a ransom,
we'll sell Daniel's photographs
of the Danish Gymnastics Team.
That is legal.
The letter in front of you will be sent
on Monday to all members of the club.
Any questions?
I think your intentions are good,
but did you ever consider the ethics
of us financially supporting
a terrorist group?
We know the fundraising
is in a legal grey area
but according to our lawyer,
we may consider it
saving a human life, which is legal.
But of course it's up to you
whether you want to help.
We do understand if some of you
don't want to support this
due to moral or other reasons.
But we still hope
that you want to help us.
Good, now close your eyes.
Okay, open your eyes. Re-adjust.
Focus.
Close again.
Abu Suheib sent me to get
a proof of life of the Dane.
We've searched him. He's clean.
Hands on the wall!
Jahash, come here.
Wait.
Do the donkey thing for us, Jahash.
Quick.
I said, "Do it now!"
Donkey!
Do it now!
I ain't got time for this shit.
Come on! Move!
Alright. We now have 742,213 kroner.
-My goodness.
-Someone wants to tell Herning Rotary.
- It's pronounced "Rotary."
- Whatever.
-Is it someone we know?
-His name is Peter Damgaard.
- Is it too risky?
- With the Rotary's 100 members…
- Then let him do it.
- Okay.
It's Arthur.
-Hello, Susanne. How are you doing?
-Fine.
I'm sending you a video.
But they don't let him say much.
There. Are you ready?
Yeah.
My mother's name is Susanne.
And my father's name is… Kjeld.
Christina… and Anita are my sisters.
And my girlfriend's name is Signe.
And the guy who was here,
who came here, is Majeed.
Do you want to watch it again?
-Hi, Signe.
-Hi, Anita.
I know it's kind of creepy
to be waiting for you,
but I've missed you.
We've collected
more than three million kroner
and I'm in touch with 20 local businesses
who might donate, but it takes time
for the boards to clear it.
I get that you're tired of this, Signe.
Nobody's expecting anything from you.
I just think the worst thing
you can do is to be all alone.
He's not coming home, Anita.
-Excuse me?
-He'll die. We won't see him again.
That's nonsense.
Did your psychologist tell you that?
That you need to believe
he's dead to move on?
Don't listen, Signe. It's absurd.
-You can't lie to yourself.
-I'm too weak. I'm not like you.
I think about what they do to him,
and I can't help him.
-I know.
-I hate that I'm so powerless.
Signe, he'll come home.
Until then, you've got us.
You can't give up on someone
you love so much. It's impossible.
He'll come home.
{\an8}KILIS, TURKEY
NEAR THE SYRIAN BORDER
-Richard.
-Good to see you, Arthur.
-This is Majeed.
-Arthur's told me about you.
-Hey.
-Jump in.
I lived in the Raqqa suburbs
some years ago,
and I know this area.
I recognized the voice of the imam
from the Friday prayer,
and I saw the compound from the inside.
It was a huge building
with underground structures.
It's this one. It used to be a school.
This is where he's being kept.
I'm sure.
Thank you for the information.
I'll pass it on.
Excuse me, pass it on?
Yes. I'll pass it on.
Let's talk about Foley
and the Damascus lead.
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe it's a dead end.
We are concentrating
at the northeast area now.
So, you're giving up on Damascus?
Yeah. For now.
This fucking asshole,
he doesn't give a shit about Daniel.
If it'll make them point
one of their satellites at the compound,
I'm cool.
And we have nothing new on Foley.
I know, but they could have lied.
That's what they're trained to do,
to fucking lie, not to--
A journalist discovered the
story about the fundraiser for Daniel Rye.
They haven't run it yet, but they
won't let someone else break it.
-Others are bound to find out.
-I'll talk to the media.
This isn't Turkey, Arthur.
We still have freedom of the press.
I'll be on my knees begging
for a media blackout. Talk to you later.
Hands on the wall!
Wojceik, you're going home.
Your government has paid.
Move!
Move! Get out!
What the fuck is going on?
We keep being next.
I can't stand it.
Look at poor Alexei.
He's been here forever,
and he hasn't even made
a proof-of-life picture yet.
They have no one to send it to.
No family.
We're all going to die.
We're never going to get out of this hell.
Come on. It's okay. Calm down.
Soon we'll go back to France.
Okay? Think about something else.
I know.
Everything will be okay.
Okay, the latest I got
is that Ayoub definitely
was a foreign warrior in Syria.
He was in Aleppo and he was in Raqqa.
-I'm here now.
-Good.
Also, it's confirmed now
that he did mention James Foley
during interrogation.
Got it. Talk to you.
Okay. Good luck.
{\an8}ANTWERP, BELGIUM
Okay. Sign here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ayoub, for seeing me.
Your French is terrible.
Who are you? Are you from the CIA?
No. The family hired me--
I appreciate the effort,
but I'd prefer it if you spoke English.
I'm hired by James Foley's
family to find him.
And I'm also looking
for a young Danish man.
Daniel Rye.
When did you last hear about James Foley?
You don't even know if he's alive.
Is he?
You're wasting your time.
Foley will die in Syria.
They'll never let him go.
Who are "they"?
Daesh, of course…
Or ISIS, as you call them.
If he starts selling off the Americans,
the true enemies of the Caliphate,
everyone would see through their scam.
Foley is doomed.
I need some names.
Names won't help you. People come and go.
I would give them to you if I had them.
I owe them nothing.
They put a fucking bag over my head
and beat me for weeks to test my faith.
They taught us to stab
and slaughter people.
They had us practice on mannequins
they made themselves.
They told us that after our first murder…
…we would feel sick and sad.
But we had to get over it.
That we were doing it for God.
And that next time, it would be easier.
And you were lucky to get out alive.
Did you ever see James Foley?
He and the other prisoners
were all taken away.
They were taken to the four British guys.
The Danish guy was with them.
But I don't know the Brits' real names.
James Foley and Daniel Rye
were kept together?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they still are.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Arthur, my friend. How are you, man?
Good news, Richard.
I finally know where Foley is.
Just 15 more seconds, guys.
- I don't feel well.
- Come on, James.
Get up! Come on! Let's go!
Go! Move!
Go! Move!
Come on! Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move!
Get the fuck up and walk!
Move!
Get down! Get down! Face the wall!
Down! Down!
Come on!
Everyone down!
Head down! Head down! Down! Move!
Heads down!
Yeah, Richard?
The school was a dry hole.
Sat picked up a couple of trucks
leaving just before our TOA,
-but we lost them in a dust cloud.
-Fuck.
It was from a Syrian airstrike.
We believe they were there.
You know, we've got…
hair and blood
and we're running it through
forensics, but, you know,
-it is what it is, man.
-Okay.
Thank you.
Take your clothes off!
Hurry up! Now!
Hurry up!
Listen up.
Americans, English, Danish.
Your countries are behind this.
I'm going to treat you the same way
your governments are treating
our Muslim brothers in Guantánamo.
Just like a concentration camp!
Bring the stuff.
Take one.
Hurry up!
You can put that on.
Hurry up!
Okay.
First, the appetizer.
One for you, my friend.
And for you.
And now the main course.
Ripe, juicy tomatoes.
We're going to eat them
right here, outside,
in the open air.
And then we'll play chess or checkers and…
Why so little?
Why so little?
What?
Why so little? Give me big tomato.
Sorry, no, they're all the same.
No. Liar.
- You think nothing of me. Nothing.
- No, no, no.
- You fucking shit.
- Have mine.
You don't care. You fuck with me.
-You no respect.
-Have-- Have mine. Alex--
-No respect.
-Alex. Alexei, stop.
You have fucking no respect.
You no respect!
No. No. You fucking with me.
Knock it off. Stop that.
Sit down!
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
He fuck me.
Give small tomato.
Alex…
That's because he's evil, Alexei.
He's manipulative and evil.
Come.
You'll be free soon, yeah?
Put him in the car.
Come on.
Out!
Walk to the pit.
To the side. Come on.
Move.
Down. Down.
Hold on.
Now I want you all to take a good look.
This is what happens
when you let an evil man
like James Foley take charge.
Look.
James, look!
Your good friend, Alexei…
…a dead man now.
This is on you, James.
You killed him, and everybody knows that.
Go!
Down. Down.
Next to Alexei.
Hold it.
Look at the camera.
Look!
Look at the camera.
Look!
Send the video
to the Danish Foreign Ministry.
And to Richard.
I'll contact the family
and send them the pictures.
-You're not letting them see the video?
-No.
The pictures will do.
"You have 48 hours to provide the total
sum of two million euro in cash."
That's all they wrote. I'm sorry.
We've raised ten million kroner.
That's nowhere near enough.
Dad, call the bank. Increase the loan.
-Tell them we need more money.
-They won't do that.
Any companies you might have overlooked?
I've-- I--
I've written to every board,
every major company in Denmark.
What am--
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I wrote to--
-Where are you going?
-To bed.
- No, don't--
- I can't do this anymore, Anita!
Please just stay, Dad.
- I'm sorry, we'll call you back later.
- It's fine.
What's going on?
-Honey…
-What's wrong with Grandpa?
-Nothing's wrong.
-He was crying.
He's not crying.
They look good.
- How are you?
- Wonderful.
Hello, Henning.
I'm Susanne.
I went to school with your wife, Mie.
Right.
I served at your wedding.
My daughter, Anita, wrote to your board.
I'm Daniel Rye's mother.
Please hear what I have to say.
Of course.
Just call and make an appointment.
I called you 20 times. No one
from your board wants to meet with me.
-I'm very sorry about your son, but--
-Please just give me ten minutes.
I have nowhere else to go.
All I ask is ten minutes of your time.
Everyone gave what they could afford,
even the small businesses.
But we're still five million kroner short.
If we can't raise that now…
… they'll kill Daniel.
I do understand
that this is a dreadful situation.
I sympathize with you
and your entire family.
-But I can't help you.
-I'm not asking for a gift.
I'm asking for a loan.
I have 14 years left before I retire.
If I work overtime,
I can pay some of it off.
I swear to you,
I'll get the rest of the money somehow.
My husband drives a truck.
He can work overtime too.
I'm so sorry, but…
…it's not possible.
I read that…
…last year you made a profit
of six billion kroner.
I've never been rich.
But if I were, I expect one meaningful
thing to do would be to help others.
-To change someone else's life.
-There's nothing we would want more.
But if our company goes down that road…
…the consequences will be unforeseeable.
-You have children, don't you?
-Yes.
Two boys and a girl.
Mm.
Thank you for at least listening to me.
No, don't pay. I offered you coffee.
It's 46 kroner. I can manage that.
Say hello to Mie.
Right. I will.
Jeremy and Luis, get up.
You're going to France.
Go on, get up.
Turn around.
Let's go.
Come. Let's go.
Let's go.
You're beginning
to get the picture, right?
Some of you are leaving…
…going home to your loved ones…
…whilst others…
You and your family
are a fucking disgrace, Jahash.
-Good morning.
-Can we have some cornflakes?
In a moment.
Anita?
Mom, Dad!
We've got 15 million!
We got five million last night.
- Look. It says 15 million!
- Did someone give five million?
We received six transfers of 800,000,
500,000, 1,000,046,
700,000, 400,000, 600,000!
-What?
-I'll call Arthur!
Wait, we need to check with the bank.
My goodness. What a strange number.
1,000,046 kroner? Who donated that?
I have no idea.
They say my family has raised the money.
That's great, Daniel.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
No, it's probably just bullshit.
No.
You're going home.
Daniel…
…will you take a letter out for my family?
Yeah, sure.
Perhaps you could memorize it?
I'll try. I'll do my best.
Do you want to bring
two million euro as carry-on?
Yes.
Who will go from the family?
-We're going too?
-Not all of you.
- Daniel needs to see a familiar face.
- You should come, Anita.
-Me?
-Yes.
Daniel and I aren't…
-He likes Christina and Mom better.
-I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.
Okay.
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.
-Turkcell?
-Vodafone.
"I think a lot about my brothers
and my sister.
I remember playing Werewolf
in the dark with…"
-Michael.
-Michael.
They're here for you.
I'll see you when you get out.
But if not, remember, it's okay.
I mean it.
You're going back to your life.
Your boring, regular life.
I'm the one who gets to stay
here and have all the fun.
I'll be okay. I really will.
You must be scared too?
But I'm more scared
of giving in to their hate.
And I don't have to, because…
…all I feel is love.
Remember…
…when you get back, forget them.
Go on with your life.
Don't waste any more time.
Jahash!
Now, go.
Jahash.
You're going home.
Daniel?
Daniel Rye?
My name is Arthur.
I'm here to bring you home to Denmark.
Take these.
Come on. Meet your sister.
Hi, Anita.
-Can I have a beer?
-Sure. Have whatever you want.
Here you go.
What about… Signe?
-I don't know, Daniel.
-Alright.
-It will take time.
-Mm-hmm.
-But everything will be okay.
-Yeah.
I've got it!
-See you tomorrow.
-Have a nice party.
-I'll throw it in and cover this guy.
-Cheat!
Take care, girls.
Let's play. You get one goal.
Officials say they disrupted
an imminent attack.
That's what they're calling it.
{\an8}Major breaking news, U.S. airstrikes
{\an8}pounding ISIS targets
inside Syria for the first time.
{\an8}The mission is clear,
to degrade and destroy ISIS.
The attacks, described as "intense,"
with those Tomahawk missiles,
as well as fighter jets and bombers.
- Hello?
- Daniel?
Yes.
-Can we talk?
-Sure.
-Is someone there with you?
-Well, my family. What is it?
We've received a video, possibly of James.
I'm sorry, but the Americans have
asked us to confirm whether it's him.
It's urgent.
You'll need to go online and search
for "ISIS video James Foley."
Close your eyes
and listen to James' voice.
When he's done speaking,
turn off the video.
I call on my friends and loved ones
to rise up against my real killers,
the U.S. government.
What will happen to me is only a result
of their complacent criminality.
Daniel?
Do you hear me, Daniel?
Can you confirm that it's James?
-  …don't accept any compensation…
-It's James.
- …for my death from the same people…
-You're sure?
…who effectively hit
the last nail in my coffin.
- I'm sure it's James.
- Thank you.
Turn off the video. Don't watch any more.
I wish I had more time…
Daniel, turn off the video.
…I wish I could have had
the hope of freedom to see
my family once again.
That ship is sailed.
I guess I wish all and all--
 Daniel, listen to me.
Turn it off. Don't watch it.
This is James Wright Foley.
-An American citizen…
-And that's-- goddammit, it's John.
That fucking bastard.
Daniel, turn off the video.
Turn it off. Don't watch it.
…who have accepted
the Islamic caliphate
as their leadership.
So, any attempt to deny
the Muslims their right
to live in safety
under the Islamic caliphate
will result in bloodshed of your people.
No! No!
No!
No!
Daniel Rye was together with Jim in Syria
for several months,
and he was the last person
to see Jim alive.
This is Daniel.
Daniel, this is James' mother, Diane.
It's so good to finally meet you.
Just before he was, uh, released,
Jim asked Daniel
to memorize a letter for us.
For his family.
These are James' words to you.
"Dear family and friends…
…I remember so many great family times,
it takes me away from this prison.
Dreams of the family and friends
takes me away,
and happiness fills my heart.
I think a lot
about my brothers… and sister.
I'm so thankful to you
for happy childhood memories.
I remember playing Werewolf…
…in the dark with Michael.
And so many other great adventures.
And Katie…
…I'm very proud of you.
You're the strongest
and the best of all of us.
I think of you working so hard
helping people as a nurse.
And I'm so glad that we texted
just before I was captured.
And I pray I can come to your wedding.
I know you're thinking of me…
…and praying for me.
I feel you all.
Especially when I pray.
And I pray that you stay strong
and that you believe.
And I really feel I can touch you.
Even in this darkness…
…when I pray."
Daniel was held hostage for 13 months
and was the last hostage to get out alive.
Seven hostages were killed.
Two of the hostages are still missing.
Following the death of the hostages,
President Obama issued
a directive to improve communication
between the US government
and the families of the hostages.
He stated that American families have
never been prosecuted for raising ransoms.
He did not mention anything
about the donors.
The Danish government maintains
its policy of not paying ransom
for Danish citizens imprisoned
by terrorist groups like ISIS.
More than 100 journalists
have died in Syria
since the beginning of the civil war.
More than 400,000
have died during the war.
Approximately 12 million people
have either fled or been exiled.
Daniel Rye still travels
and works as a photojournalist.
He and Signe got back together,
and they now have a son.
"Many of the people
who come to Denmark from Syria
have had experiences far worse than mine."
