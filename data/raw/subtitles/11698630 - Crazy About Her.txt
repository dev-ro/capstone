I'm not saying it'll be easy.
But I am saying it'll be worth it.
Anything is possible if you try.
People have to blame their problems
on luck, destiny, karma...
But you know
what always drives someone to failure?
"Ugh, I can't do it,"
"I quit..."
They never say to themselves,
"I'm gonna keep fighting
for what I want."
Not fighting for what you want
leads to one thing...
failure.
What do you know about failure?
Your dad got you a job
straight out of university.
- Laura spent seven years trying to...
- Whoa! Four to seven.
- They've all said no.
- Not all of them, no.
This whole "where there's a will, there's
a way" stuff is fine up to a point, but...
We spend most of our adult lives working.
The only way to be truly happy
is if we do what we love.
You don't think that's important, huh?
Living out your dream.
Yeah... yeah, but I think...
- I think we need more beer.
- More than anything.
Hang on there, Mr. Wonderful.
Are you saying
your dream is to write trash
for the Internet?
Pardon me, sir,
but I am an investigative journalist
who uses reliable sources.
- You're serious?
- Could I get another one?
Your last article was "Anxiety, Stress
and Other Imaginary Friends."
People love that kind of shit.
What about "My Mothers Are Lesbians
and It Turns Me On"?
Totally real!
Seville guy. Funny but tragic.
"Sleep With Any Woman
by Saying You Went to School Together"?
That has a 100% success rate.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Go on. Any girl at the bar. Make it a bet.
- Bet you a beer.
- Deal!
Um... The blonde at the bar.

you've been checking out all night?
- Okay. Laura?
- Mm-hmm?
Don't wait up for me.

Whoa! Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I spilled your drink.
- You what? I didn't have a drink.
- How about I buy you one?
Oh, were you gonna hit on her?
No. I mean, yes,
but not because I wanted to. Just...
Look, I'll be honest.
I made a bet with my friends.
Stupid...
I bet I could sleep with her.
It's funny because I bet my friends
that I could sleep with you!
- Those girls.
- I see.
- Hey!
- Uh...
But anyway, I'm gonna need your help.
I really don't wanna pay
for those damn drinks.
- Besides, my plan for you is foolproof.
- Oh yeah, what's that?
- I have a look.
- Mmm.
Watch.
First, I lower my chin.
Then I part my lips.
Then I look up just a little,
like we're in a dream.
And then...
Boo!
So how about those drinks?
Perfect!
Oh, sorry.
- Hey!
- Give me a second.
So, I'm in a rush,
and I'm done with this place.
And I need something else, okay?
I'm gone. Excuse me.
Okay...
- What are you waiting for? Come on.
- So we can't we just stay here?
Pff! No, big no.
Listen.
Tonight I really need someone...
Someone to have an amazing night with,
fuck and never see again.
What always ruins a perfect night?
The next day.
See, if you call, you're annoying.
If you don't, you're a piece of shit.
Then you have to meet the family,
the friends and pretend you like them.
I really hate meeting the family.
Everyone does! Getting to know each other
screws everything up.
Let's just have a great night
and never get to the bad stuff.
A perfect time together
that will never be ruined.
I have an early start tomorrow,
so I need to know.
- Uh, shit.
- Am I scaring you?
Scared?
I don't know the meaning of the word.
- Great!
- See you outside.
Uh, what about your friends?
Them?
Never seen them before in my life.
Give me a second.
- Run.
- Why?
Because I just stole this helmet.
Go!
Um, maybe slow down a bit, please?
Hey! Watch out!
Are you trying to get us killed?
- Are you always this annoying?
- Hey, where are we going?
Where do you think?
Hey, uh,
don't you wanna have a drink first?
I said I was in a hurry.
- This is a five-star hotel.
- Excuse me?
Could I get a maid to floor two?
Yes, I just need...
Never mind. Thank you!
Wedding reception.
A wedding? Seriously?
It has everything
you would want for a perfect night.
Just as long as you're not the bride.
And didn't you want a drink?
Open bar!
Just follow my lead.
No! No, no, no, no, no.
My cousin's gonna kill me.
We can go in, right?
- Yes, if you tell me your name.
- Oh no! She's gonna be so upset.
Growing up she said she'd die
if I didn't come to her wedding.
I... I really don't want her to die.
Mohapi and guest. Right there.
Mohapi?
- Mohapi.
- And guest.
Yeah, but the dress code is formal attire.
Don't you hate it
when they make you dress up to fit in?
I mean, I think I look pretty good, no?
I do, right?
Oh, mama!
This is wicked!
What are we doing here?
What people do at weddings!
Eat!
And drink.
Hey!
How's it going?
It's been way too long.
You look so pretty. So pretty.
Hi!
Hi, how are you?
I'm the bride's cousin.
To the bride!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You're nuts, you know that?
Yeah. So are you.
Please, everyone. A moment of your time.
Uh...
As godfather,
I've been asked to say a few words.
I think very highly of this couple,
and I think I speak
for everyone here when I wish you
the best of marriages.
To you.
Cheers!
What kind of shit speech was that?
My cousin deserves better, you know?
Okay.
- Hello. Sorry. Hi.
- How's it going? Okay.
I am sorry, but no...
I couldn't just sit there
I just have to say
that I'm so proud of both of you.
If you know these two well,
you know they're a perfect example
of love... and persistence.
It is really hard
finding love in this world.
Finding someone who loves you...
...through the good and the bad times.
Who won't just walk away...
...when they've seen your worst days.
The scary days.
And I don't need to tell you guys
how scary the bride can be!
Here's to a happy life together!
Here's to the lovebirds!

YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE
I need to find her.
- Didn't she say it was just sex.
- When I say it, they never call me.
- Look, we're gonna find her.
- No way. Impossible.
What do we know about her?
Her name's Carla.
- Remember anything else?
- I don't know, Laura.
- I can't believe he's in love!
- Hey, hey! Wait a second.
- In love?
- Mm-hmm.
I just want her number.
- That's it.
- Adri...
You fell in love.
It's okay. It was bound to happen one day.
My first love was my gym teacher.
He didn't even know it.
Every time I went to his class... Mmm.
What happened?
He got fired.
They found out he was a creep.
This isn't love!
Just a little...
Are you sure you checked the coat
and all its pockets?
Did I check? Of course I checked!
Laura, come on, it's a jacket.
It's not like
there's that many places to look.
- And what about the inside pocket?
- I already told you...
- The what, now?
- Hmm.
- What inside pocket?
- This one right here.
"Fluoxetine. Take one per day orally.
Carla Colomer Montorio.
Residence of Los Sauces."
- This is it!
- Ah...
To love! Idiot.
LOS SAUCES RESIDENCE
- Hmm, I'll go.
- Yeah.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm here to see Carla Colomer.
- Your name, sir, please?
- Adrián. Adrián Mallo.
Adrián Mallo. Adrián...
You're not on the visitor list.
- Can't let you in.
- Yeah, but it'll only take a minute, so...
Not on the list, you can't get in.
I can't say hi?
What kind of hospital is this?
Well, this is a center for mental health.
Mental hospital?
No way.
Give me one moment.
Hello, Los Sauces.
Sure, can I have your name, please?
Yes, Cuenca.
Okay, and your phone number?
Thank you.
- Carla!
- Hey, stand back!
Carla!
Carla!
Let go!
- Go! Stand back.
- Come on.
Get out!
Have some respect! Only patients
and official visitors are allowed in here.
Understand?
Are you sure about this?
Can we trust this guy?
He can help with this.
I know how he got his license.
Also, he used to have a thing for me.
How can I help?
Doctor Rodríguez? Rodri?
I'm Laura Ordobás from university? Lauri?
- Someone call security.
- No, no, no, please! I didn't mean...
I gotcha!
Yeah.
I didn't press any button.
As a matter of fact, there isn't a button.
What would I even do with one?
- No idea.
Laura Ordobás!
Lauri!
Well, you're not the only actor
in this office.
Yeah, yeah, you got me.
- Still as beautiful as ever.
- Well...
No, no, no!
Uh, still messing with you!
- Ah, great.
- So, what do you need?
Prescriptions? Paroxetine,
sertraline, bupropion are 200 euros.
- No.
- No, no, no. No!
- Friends and family only...
- No!
- We need something else.
- It's... Yeah.
- Amphetamines? Marijuana?
- No, no. No drugs.
Ketamine?
Look, I need
to be admitted to a psychiatric center.
I'm hoping you'll sign a report
as my doctor, saying that you treated me.
What you're asking is immoral,
and I still have principles.
Which can be bought for 1,100 euros.
Say, 1,000, okay?
Sorry.
Ugh, Andrés.
- Yeah, Andrés!
- Adri? Where are you?
- What's going on with the article?
- Yes, I was about to call you.
I'm gonna need another day.
Uh, the article
is about a psychiatric center.
From the inside.
It isn't too late to back out.
This is completely nuts.
Then I'm in the right place, I guess.
Swear to me you're out of there as soon
as you find that girl and talk to her.
Yes! I get in. I play the part,
find her, get her number.
We're happy. I get out.
Perfect plan. Foolproof.
Break a leg.
Boom!
Right.
Depression, lack of empathy,
withdrawal, stress, anxiety
All of it. I'm fucked up.
Frankly, I don't know why
you didn't come here earlier.
Right!
This is the living room, the sitting room,
the salon, whatever you wanna call it.
- This is Rosa. She's the head nurse here.
- Hello.
If there's anything you need, mmm,
don't ask her. She has a temper.
Okay, I can hear you!
No, but seriously, she's a monster.
On we go.
Los Sauces is a private residence.
Mm-hmm.
- The cost is 2,000 euros per month.
- Fuck me!
Can I get a discount
if you only treat my depression?
No.
Here we have the dining room,
where we eat breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, all at set hours each day.
Here is the garden, huh?
So, whenever you would like
some fresh air or a swim to relax,
you can't. It's just to look at.
Joking!
You can go out three times a day,
scheduled, of course.
What are you looking at?
I could have you killed.
This is the visiting room.
- What's wrong, Victor? Are you okay?
- Yeah, can I have more soap per week?
- Because it's empty already.
- It's just not possible to give you more.
- Yeah, but this is shitty soap.
- I know.
How about we talk when I get back?
Perfect.
Marta, you all right?
Yes. Golden Age. Bitch!
- Have a good day, sweetheart.
- You too.
Whore!
- She's marvelous. Marvelous.
- Mm-hmm.
Here is your admission form.
Once you sign, you're in.
See? You're entitled to one visitor
and one phone call per month.
- And most importantly...
- Two thousand euros! I know. Um...
This room is yours.
There's a shared bathroom on every floor.
And this is Saúl, your roommate.
COINCIDENCE OR CONSPIRACY?
- Saúl, Adrián.
- Hi, there.
I think you'll get along just fine.
Right?
Saúl, you'll give him a tour?
- That's not necessary.
- No, it's tradition.
The veteran
always shows the newbie around.
It's a genius idea, right?
I came up with it myself.
You're not wearing a wire, are you?
No.
Why do you think I'd be wearing a wire?
Okay.
I'll let you two roomies
get to know each other.
Have a blast, guys. See you later.
Always after you.
Reading room, Fermín,
poetry, mystery, and other stuff.
Down there, more patients' rooms.
This is a hallway, a very short hallway.
There's good water in here, always cold.
Here we got the lounge.
We've got people playing games.
Computers.
But you should know
that all the best websites are blocked.
And up there, you see there?
They tell us
that that's a multipurpose room,
but what the hell is a multipurpose room?
Great! Really. Great.
- Thanks, man. That was...
- Tell me who you're spying for?
No, no, no, no, no!
I'm looking for a girl here named Carla.
Do you know her?
Maybe I know her, and maybe I don't.
Sometimes you think
you know someone, but you don't.
Maybe it's not the person you know
or the person you don't know...
It's really her!
- Who?
- Carla!
I do know a Carla.
Usually in there.
- They call it the painting room.
- Thanks.
Hey. Guess who?
Guille?
No. I'll give you a hint, okay?
We had the best night
of our lives together.
Wow!
Uh, Dani?
Uh, no.
- Edu!
- No.
Mmm...
- Jaime!
- Uh, no.
It's me!
- Surprise!
- Manu?
- Adri.
- Adri!
I don't get it.
- How are you here? What happened to you?
- I...
I snuck in... to see you.
- You're joking. I... What?
- A friend helped me.
- It's a funny story.
- But how...
I realized, when we met the other night,
you escaped from here.
That's why you ran off.
I thought I was clear that it...
that it was just for one night, no?
Yeah, but that was before
everything happened that night.
No, it's... No.
I don't understand. What...
what do you mean "everything happened"?
I saw you the other day.
You were with a nurse.
You smiled at me.
I would've been heavily sedated
if I was with a nurse.
I wouldn't remember anything.
So you weren't happy to see me?
Uh, obviously not. No.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Uh... nothing.
I wanted to see you
and get your number.
You're a complete lunatic.
Well, everyone in this place is a lunatic.
Great!
Why are you here?
You seem fine to me!
You just... Mmm!
You actually think you know me
because we slept together?
Come on! Have you seen these people?
They're like straight
out of that Freaks movie.
Wow.
- Look, Manu.
- Adri.
Hmm?
The girl you have a crush on isn't me.
You don't know me. You never will.
- Carla, listen.
- Get out of here!
- Listen to me.
- Get the fuck out of here!
Unbelievable.
- It's that way!
- Yeah, I'm getting my coat, thanks.
Ah.
Have a great time.
- He's leaving?
- Yep, he thinks he is.
Hold on. What are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- You've been discharged?
I don't need to be. I'm fine.
Yeah. Patients can't just leave.
Guys, I'm not in the mood.
Hey! Hey!
What are you... what are you doing?
Great. You win.
Let's get the nurse in here. Come on.
- You can't get out that way.
- Rosa!
There's no handles,
just like the windows in banks.
You're gonna have to go
all the way upstairs
if you wanna get out of here.
The other two doors are locked.
- It smells weird up there. Don't know why.
- There are 36 cameras.
Thirty-six cameras.
We're always on television. Thirty-six.
Ah.
- What's going on?
- Nurse?
Tell them to let me out. I'm fine.
You can only be discharged
by the director.
Ma'am, I shouldn't be here, hmm?
Let me out.
But Adrián,
you're the one who asked to be admitted.
I've changed my mind.
When you signed this form,
you signed over your guardianship.
- What?
- We decide when you can be released.
By the way,
your signature is very interesting.
Signatures reveal a lot.
Maybe one day I'll explain
the significance of these lines...
I made it all up, okay?
It's all a lie.
The new ones
always try it once, don't they?
- Remember the one last...
- That's enough.
No, I'm telling the truth.
This is all a mistake. I need to get out.
Look, Adrián,
if you want to leave, you can leave.
- I can?
- Of course!
Once we've seen behavioral improvements
and that you're getting along
nicely with everyone.
See,
here the patients evaluate each other.
It's a, mmm, system
I may have come up with myself.
- Brilliant, right?
- For sure.
Excuse me! I'm a journalist.
I came here to write an article.
Mmm?
Okay? You call my editor at work
and confirm it.
- This is Load.
- Hi. Good afternoon.
I'm calling
from the psychiatric residence Los Sauces.
We have a patient here, Adrián Mallo.
He's a marvelous young man,
but he insists that he's a journalist
at your magazine.
Do you know him?
Adrián?
Adrián, Adrián Mallo.
Mmm. No, no. No idea.
No idea?
- Ah! Ana, it's me, Adri!
- Hey! Hey!
Ana, it's not funny!
- So you don't know him?
- Sorry, no.
My mistake. Sorry.
Ciao.
Ana! Please! Ana!
Hey, what's the matter?
I know that you think we're all deranged
and that deranged people aren't all there,
but we're actually pretty good
at listening, so tell me what's going on.
- Gotta get out of here.
- Well, it's not a prison.
Eventually, you'll be released,
and then you can go home.
I need to leave now.
You wanna leave now?
See? There's no lock.
A gift left for us
by the Grasshopper.
Only thing is it's a free fall
from three floors up.
To this day,
the only person to have done it
is Pablo the Grasshopper.
He's a legend here. A legend!
And did Pablo die?
Well, he... he broke...
he broke both of his legs.
But he dragged himself home bit by bit.
He was perfect. Legendary.
I'm gonna do it.
I'll land on the trash, hopefully.
Just...
I think the garbage is a great idea,
but it's just that the Grasshopper,
he also landed in the garbage.
He thought it would work too,
but then he broke both legs.
So, you might wanna think strategically.
Maybe you want to...
I got it.
Okay.
I got this.
- I'll help you.
- What are you doing?
- One...
- You can fly.
- Two...
- Believe in yourself.
- Three...
- You can do it.
Go! Go! Go!
It's too high up, damn it!
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Yes, I've been diagnosed, yes.
- I can use the phone, right?
- But who are you gonna call?
- I see, mmm, Dr. Ramírez?
- Mm-hmm.
You're here
to take Adrián Mallo?
As his personal psychologist,
I believe Adrián would be better off
in a private atmosphere.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- A psychologist?
- Mm-hmm. Well, just graduated.
Got some fresh ideas.
And why are you wearing a stethoscope?
Well, it's so nobody has to ask,
"Is there a doctor in the house?"
They just know.
Just fascinating.
Remind me. Where did you study?
- At the Autónoma.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
- I did too!
- Yes?
- So you worked with Dr. Pedro Pascual.
Of course, Pedrito. For sure.
I'm just in love with his paper
on the efficacy and progress
of empirical treatments.
What do you think?
Oh, me too. It's like I always say,
"If it's not empirical, it's not for me."
Those aren't prescription glasses.
No.
Mmm.
Well, then,
I guess you'll show yourself out, right?
Yep. Perfect.
Laura! Hey, hey!
- What did you do?
- Don't know what happened. She caught me.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I've gotta perfect my Dr. Ramírez.
No, you think? Oh, shit!
This is not my fault!
I warned you this would happen!
They won't let me leave, Laura.
I am a prisoner.
Maybe just calm down?
I won't calm down!
This nightmare can't get any worse.
It's about to. Andrés called.
If you don't send in the article today,
you're fired.
Shit! The article! What am I gonna do?
- You could try writing it?
- That's a good idea. Got a pen, paper?
No, uh, now?
- Yeah, now.
- No.
- I have an audition, Adri.
- Your cell phone!
- Make it fast!
- Ready?
- Hold on.
- Mmm.
Go!
Where do all of society's outcasts end up?
- Really?
- The answer may surprise you.
Lunacy, lunacy. Look it up for me.
- What?
- Lunacy, lunacy. Check the dictionary!
It's the same thing, day in, day out.
Not a single word
out of your mouth makes any sense.
- Mmm. You know I can hear you, right?
- I know you can hear...
Yeah, I want you to hear me.
Adri? Care to join us?
Just give us five minutes.
That's all I'm asking
If that's too much to ask...
This is to help you.
The medication will be good for you.
I don't need to take any medication
because I'm not crazy, hmm?
We try not use that word, "crazy."
You are patients, and you each follow
your own course of therapy.
I don't need any fucking therapy! Fuck!

Hey, Adri.
You want to get out of here, no?
Yeah, sure.
Right, so first you need to start
getting along with everybody.
Because around here, the, uh... the...
the patients, they evaluate each other.
- Yeah, but how do I do that?
- I'll help you.
You will?
Well, I just think it's a good idea,
and it feels good to help somebody out.
So, what have you got for me?
All right, the first thing
you'll have to do, the very first thing
is participate in all the activities
around here, you hear me?
All of them. So I want you to take this
and come with me to an event.
Tonight. We're gonna go together. Tonight.
This conversation never happened.
Where are you taking me?
They're gonna go after you
with everything they've got, you hear me?
But you, Adri,
do not let them smell your fear.
You must be like a coffin
or a dead tree or a sealed tomb.
Okay, huh.
I've got you
right where I want you, you bitch.
Hah! I'm gonna double your bet. Four.
- Four.
- Risky move.
How about you
make it easier on yourself
and give me the pills now.
Forget about the poker.
I don't know
if an ex-gambler should even be playing.
Ex-gambler, whatever you say!
- What have you got?
- Flush.
- Fuck it!
- Oh boy.
So sorry, Tina,
but say goodbye to your pills!
Damn it!
Poker.
I'll take your citalopram, fluoxetine,
and those blunts.
I wish I would've brought condoms.
I know you could use them.
Shh! Shh!
Carla, keep it down.
You're all being very, very noisy.
What the fuck is he doing here?
- If you want, I can go.
- Great, thank you.
It's just...
I thought these might interest you.
You think
you can bribe us with some pills?
- We might be crazy, but do we look stupid?
- Some more than others.
Is that diazepam?
You got some Rivotril?
You're in. Pull up a chair.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Hey, what's up?
Do I know you?
Don't worry about Sergio.
He doesn't even know himself.
You could spend an entire century
talking to him, and after five minutes,
he'll have forgotten all about it.
Is that true?
Impossible.
That's the first time I've heard it.
Hey, Adri,
want to tell us about your debut?
- My what?
- Debut.
That's what we call the first time...
...you feel like a stranger in your mind.
Ah, no, no, never had that.
Hey, me neither. As far as I remember.
- Hey! I'm serious!
- We know, honey.
- Of course you are. Don't worry.
- Mmm. Ah.
Don't you all wanna leave?
Hell yeah! I'm counting down the days
until I get out of this fucking place.
Why are you here, Tina?
Oh, I lost my head at work.
It was a total meltdown.
- Mm-hmm. What kind of work?
- I'm a princess.
Is this asshole laughing at me?
- These commoners.
- Are you serious?
I'm gonna take my cards and leave.
I don't need all this.
Okay. A princess, I got it.
The king and the queen,
those are my fucking parents.
- Come on, Tina, I can see your cards.
- Oh, shit!
Look, I... I only meant that maybe
we should be working together
to get out sooner.
Perhaps give each other good marks
so we can get out?
I live in a palace.
Yes, but every single one of us is
in this place because we really need it.
- You all look good to me.
- You have no idea why we're here, Adri.
Wait for me.
I have to go to the bathroom.
- Come on! Ugh.
- Seriously! Can we play some poker?
Try not to wash your hands 847,000 times.
Okay, let him wash his hands
as many times as he... he wants.
Okay.
You're so ridiculous.
And you, Marta?
Don't you want to get out of here?
Yeah, of course.
What she actually wants
is to get her hands on Victor.
Víctor?
Isn't he a little bit, uh, neurotic?
Don't call him that, please.
So, how's that going? Any progress?
Any progress. All she can do
is tell him about her pussy!
- Your parents love to eat my pussy.
- Hey, hey.
- Long live the Republic, you bitch.
- You can't fake your tics with me, eh?
- Keep your voices down.
- Why don't you just tell him how you feel?
- Hmm?
- You know?
"Hey, Víctor, I like you."
Ask him to get a coffee or something.
No, no, can't. No, no. Mmm, mmm. Ah!
No.
If there's a will, there's a way.
Did you get that shit off a mug?
Hey, can we just shut up
and keep going with the game?
Ah!
No. I have a better idea.
- If I help Marta get a date with Víctor...
- Excuse me?
...will you all give me good marks
at the next meeting?
I can't tell if you're nuts
or just an asshole?
- O... okay.
- If you fail, will you shut the fuck up?
If I do fail, you get all my pills.
You're on.
I haven't accepted yet.
- Oh, he's back.
- I'm back. Did I miss anything?
No, no, no. Not much.
- No! Come on, don't screw me over!
- Marta! Marta!
Tomorrow at 11:00, Marta.
Eat my pussy.
You'll find
that helping Marta is impossible.
No way.
Anything is possible if you try.
What's up with your hair?
I also smell amazing.
Smell. Go on.
Hmm.
Marta may be a lost cause,
but you can help me with something.
Besides, you owe me a favor.
I thought you said it felt good
to help somebody, no?
No.
I offer the opportunity for you
to give something back to me.
I see. So, what can I do?
Something that's practically legal.
My old roommate used to help me out,
but he's gone now.
Was he released?
I can neither confirm nor deny that.
Take this. Take it.
Now, follow me. Follow me.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Follow me.
Come here. Put this on.
Put it on. Then... Just do as I do.
Follow my lead, okay?
So, Doctor,
are you absolutely certain
this is your diagnosis?
Really very interesting.
- What are you doing?
- Papa!
Hey!
My girl!
Oh, it's so good to see you. Ooh!
Daddy's working right now.
Today I'm working with Dr. Mole.
- You wanna say hi to Dr. Mole?
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Good job.
Daddy will be done really soon, okay?
So...
...it would seem
you and I have the same diagnosis, Doctor.
The flu, yep!
I prescribe a course of aspirin
every eight hours.
- And a few doses of jelly?
- Strawberry!
Of course! Strawberry, Doctor.
Very important. Strawberry.
The patient must not be disappointed.
A berry good plan!
Please, see to it.
Hey!
- Hi.
- Thank you, both.
Thank you so much for coming.
We, uh... we have to leave
in, uh, ten minutes.
Ten minutes? That's nothing, ten minutes.
We have things to do, don't we, dear?
Of course, that's...
- Right. I'll see you. Bye, Saúl.
- Sorry, Saúl.
Ten minutes? Just ten minutes?
Hey!
- Go.
- Hey!
That's ten whole super minutes, Sara!
We're gonna have to use every single one.
Yes, we will. Yes, we will. Yes, we will!
Hey!
Thank you so, so much! Thank you, Auri.
Oh, Sara, I was thinking.
Maybe we could pick up that game of pool
we started last time, huh?
- What do you think?
- Yeah! Let's go!
The delivery guy had to use a truck
to bring all the shit you bought
with the credit card.
With my credit card.
I already said I was sorry.
Please, I'm sorry!
Why did you... How could you
buy a motorcycle with my card?
The doctor told us
she was going through an episode.
I'm sorry, Papa. You don't deserve
a crazy daughter, a problem, like me.
Please don't say that.
You'll get better soon.
No, Mom, no.
I'm not gonna get better. Get it?
Maybe you should try a little bit harder.
Like when I feel sad or upset,
I watch a funny movie...
Stop it!
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Thank you for coming.
- What, you're kicking us out?
- No.
You can stay.
Go out, enjoy the beautiful scenery
without me. I just...
I just need to be by myself
for a minute or two.
No, no, no. We're not leaving yet.
But I'm...
I'm sorry, but visiting hours are over.
- There are no time limits on visiting.
- No, but, um...
Carla must take her medicine.
- Her Propalodontknowitine.
- Fine, then. Fine.
But, Doctor, wait a minute. I...
What was the name of the drug?
I've never heard of it.
We should really be getting going, Carla.
The other doctors are waiting.
You're not getting a thank-you.
You're still an asshole.
Pleasure was all mine.
You're just trying
to get a good grade, aren't you?
Yeah. Why else would I help you?
It's for you.
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.
Could you let us out?
Yo! That was great!
Why do people always say these things?
You know what I mean? "Saúl, you're crazy.
Saúl, you can't be a father"
What does that mean, Adri?
Do you have children?
No.
So, why the lab coats?
Well, it´s because the lab coats
are for people who aren't sick
And my ex's husband
seems to think that I...
That my little girl shouldn't find out.
- I'll take the lab coat now, Saúl.
- Could you hold this?
It's pretty good.
Why are you so pleased?
No... no reason.
Are you so happy because you think
that, by helping Marta,
you'll get out soon? Uh-uh.
Sure.
It's not the final version, but at least
it's somewhere we can start.
"Víctor, I need to ask you
a very important question.
Is your name Google?
Because you have everything
I'm searching for."
Do you want me to look like an idiot?
Humor.
It never fails.
Trust me.
Víctor, I need to ask you m...
- Melon!
- Again.
Víctor, I need to ask you
a very important question. Is your name...
- Lesbian!
- No. Try again.
Víctor, I need to ask you
a very important question.
Is your name Google?
Because you have everything
I'm searching for.
- Okay, you feel good?
- Whoo!
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on. Again.
Víctor, I need to ask you
a very important question.
- Is your name...
- Again.
Víctor, I need to ask you
a very important question.
- Is your name Google...
- Again.
- Víctor, I need to ask you... Ooh, ooh, ah!
- You a question!
Breathe.
Ah...
That's right!
Look at me. Look at me.
Hey, can we take a break, please?
Sure.
Hey...
People with your syndrome
can lead a normal life.
Yeah.
And so?
I mean,
nobody goes into a psychiatric center
because of Tourette's.
Then why are you here?
Because it's not easy...
...having a normal life
when everyone is always laughing at you
and judging you for your tics.
Bitch!
I mean, I spent three months
unable to get out of bed.
I was afraid to go out...
outside.
I was diagnosed with depression.
Can we continue?
There he is.
Go for it.
- Rainy weather. It's just bad luck, right?
- Even better!
- What do you mean, "better"?
- Haven't you ever seen The Notebook?
I hate romantic comedies.
- It's not a comedy.
- Huh?
Bitch!
Oh well, anyway.
Remember what I said?
Believe that you can fly...
I will never repeat that.
You know it's dumb.
...and your feet will float off the ground.
I'm going. I'm going. I'm going.
Where do you get this shit?
Hey...
Come on.
Come on, Marta.
That's right, Marta.
Tell them to get lost.
Could you guys give us a... a second?
- Nothing personal.
- Okay.
- See you later, Marta.
- Ah!
Good, good. Let's all go.
Give them a little bit of privacy, people.
You've got this, Marta.
Víc...
Víctor, I need to ask you
a very important question, okay?
- Fine.
- Is your na... name Google?
No. What?
Yeah, that's it.
She's got this.
I don't... I don't understand.
I need to ask you
a really important question,
and I need you to answer me.
Tell me, is your name A... Azalea?
Bitch! Bitch!
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch.
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's fine. It's okay.
- I'm gonna go.
- But... but I thought you had a question.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no!
What... what's happening?
What are you doing?
Marta, get back out there, okay?
Marta, come on! Marta, listen to me!
- Marta, hang on.
- Go back.
Marta. Marta, hang on a second.
Why don't you just tell him?
No tricks, no pretending.
Don't just do... Look at me.
Don't just do what the whole fucking world
expects you to do.
And if he does likes you, you know what?
He better like you as you are.
Yeah?
- A little crazy?
- A little crazy.
All right, I'm going.
Come on, Marta.
Let's go. You can do it.
I can't believe how hooked I am
on this weird soap opera.
- That's because you're as corny as he is.
- What the hell was that, little princess?
Ví... Víctor, I really like you.
I said it.
Well, I...
I... I don't understand.
What I mean is... I like you.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I like you.
Yeah, I think I understand.
Please, please, please.
Say yes.
Okay.
So, like...
I... I...
Also maybe... Mmm...
Fuck!
I've never done this before. I'm an idiot.
No way.
The only idiot standing here is me.
- Look at me.
- No.
- You're not an idiot.
- We're so bad at this.
- They're laughing!
- Looking good. Come on, Marta.
- Come on.
- This is it!
Yeah, I see them.
I'd like to kiss you now.
Don't worry, hey?
My... my teeth are really clean.
Brushed twice.
Twice?
Come on, Marta, you can do this.
Yeah.
My clothes are clean too.
Fresh out of the laundry
on a two-hour cycle.
Wow! That's the one I use too.
Awesome!
I think I may... may need a little help.
Yeah! Yes, yes, yes!
Fuck yeah!
- She did it!
- What did I say?
Here's to love! Here's to...
If we give him good marks
at the next meeting,
we can get rid of him.
- It actually worked.
- Well, thanks to you.
- We did it together.
- Sure, fifty-fifty, right?
Plans tonight?
Tonight? Mmm...
No plans. Why?
I'll see you at 7:00.
Hey!
Well, I did it!
They love me.
Told you it would work.
What's wrong, Saúl?
Hey, hey.
Are you okay?
My ex made me promise
to stop seeing my daughter
because...
because it would be dangerous for her.
I don't... I don't think it was her idea.
Her husband, I bet he...
- Whoa, whoa! Buddy, buddy!
- I'm gonna go to his house.
- I'm gonna get my girl back!
- No, no, no! Don't say that!
No, no, no, no, no!
You don't fall apart now, got it?
What you gotta do is...
...think positive.
I don't...
Do you mind if I... if I could just
be alone in the...
Can you leave me alone for a bit?
I just wanna be alone for a while here.
Could you go now, please?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, Saúl. I'll go.
I don't... I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
It's his ex's husband.
He can't see his daughter anymore.
That fucking sucks.
Saúl's a good man.
He doesn't deserve that.
What?
Are you ever gonna tell me?
Tell you what?
Why you're really here.
I'm bipolar.
- Type 1.
- Bipolar?
Mm-hmm.
And that's like when one day you're...
you're sad,
but then the next day you're all happy?
Not exactly.
That's more like rapid cycling.
Mine change over a longer time.
One period's depressive
and the next euphoric.
So, when was your debut?
Very good! Quick learner.
At 13.
Ran away from home.
The police found me
trying to get on a boat
to get to a Pulp concert in England.
- No way!
- By myself.
In euphoric episodes,
you don't think about the consequences.
And the next morning,
you wake up in a war zone.
You've set off a bomb,
and everyone hates you.
Like your dad.
I always max out his credit card
when I'm euphoric.
Hmm.
And the depressive times?
You know how...
some diseases can kill you?
In this case,
you find yourself wishing it would.
Whee!
Fun times.
The night you met me,
you were in euphoria, hmm?
- Yeah, it was the start of a manic period.
- Manic is... is euphoria?
Yeah.
I'm a manic-depressive.
That night was incredible.
For me, anyway.
Yeah.
It was for me too.
Adri, I...
I'm not gonna let this go any further.
- I don't get it.
- Yeah, you do.
You don't know what it's like
being with someone
who can't control their feelings.
But aren't you learning to control them?
That's why you're here.
Oh, you're just like my mother.
You don't know how this works.
Okay, fine, maybe I don't,
but I know you can do it.
The human brain is fucking amazing.
It's been proven
that a willingness to recover
is even more effective than medicine.
Did you swallow a self-help book as a kid?
I'm being serious, I swear.
You're sure?
I am sure.
A hundred percent.
We both know that you can do anything.
And this guru's gonna help you.
Adri...
- What?
- I had a great night.
But you and I still can't go any further.
Go on.
Finish this shit.
Shit, shit, shit!
Damn it, Saúl!
Okay, you can do this.
It's just three floors.
Just three floors.
Three.
Two.
One.
No fucking way!
Carla, I need you.
- Oh my God! Can you let it go already?
- No, no, no! It's not that.
- The night we met?
- Uh-huh?
How did you escape?
- What?
- It's Saúl.
Okay, he's asleep.
Let's move.
Come on.
He can't have gotten too far.
You have a key?
- I had sex with a security guard.
- That's funny.
- You're kidding, right?
- Get in.
Who's remote?
Neus. She works at the front gate.
And how did you get it?
Holy shit! Nobody's safe.
It always gets stuck. Go open it.
- Okay.
- Oh! Don't slam the... Shh!
Shh! Fucking amateur hour over here!
- Shh! Quiet!
- Ow!
- What?
- Why do I even bother?
Oh damn, I love driving.
Don't you think
you could go a little bit slower?
- Why? Are you scared?
- No. No, no.
I promise. When I get out,
the first thing I'm doing
is getting my license.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
Carla, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Oh my God!
Saúl! Saúl, wait!
Would you stop acting crazy!
- Saúl!
- Saúl, stop.
Saúl, listen to me.
If you go after your daughter now,
you'll never see her again.
But if I get her,
then she can stay with me.
Don't argue with him.
He can't see anything. He can't...
Saúl. Saúl, listen.
Please listen to me, Saúl.
You need to calm down.
Please, Saúl, for me.
- You have to listen to me...
- That's enough. Saúl, calm down.
You have to... I get it Saúl.
- She's my girl!
- Your girl.
Your little girl, I know.
You need to explode. You need to scream.
You need to burn the world down.
But this isn't the way.
You don't wanna wake up tomorrow morning
and realize that you messed up so badly,
you hurt someone you love.
Right?
But I just can't go back.
- I gotta do something. I have to.
- No. No, no.
We're not taking you back.
We won't stop you. We'll help you, okay?
We'll do something...
something that feels good
but that won't get you thrown
into prison, okay?
Yeah?
It's gonna have to satisfy me
because I don't care if I go to prison.
- It has to satisfy me.
- I promise you.
- Promise me, Carla.
- You bet.
Thank you.
- What do we do?
- I thought you knew.
No idea. No.
I may have an idea.
- Right here?
- Yes.
I'll go see if they're sleeping. Shh.
They're asleep for now.
Come on. Quick! Do it.
Now.
That's it?
We came here for that?
Ah, Saúl. Don't you want to do this?
Or this?
- Have some fun!
- I am having fun. I just...
Oh! Neat!
- How was that?
- See?
- How does it feel, Saúl?
- Well, how does it feel for you?
Fucking amazing!
Whoa.
- Fuck this car up, Saúl.
- I like that idea.
To hell with this fucking car.
Whoa!
- We gotta go.
- I don't think he even has a car.
Are you kidding?
Hey,
I'm a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
You expect me to remember
all these things?
Come on, Saúl!
- Is that your excuse for everything?
- Hey, but are you satisfied?
Hey! Goddamn it, that's my car!
- Oh shit!
- Run, run! Go, go, go!
What the fuck?
I'll kill you! Come back! I'll kill you!
Check it out.
Sleeping like a baby.
That was fun.
It was.
You're so full of it!
But you know what?
I'm happy you snuck into the hospital.
I'm glad you're here.
Do you mind?
Careful when you close...
Ridiculous. Amateurs.

Come on.
Hey, hey, hey, careful.
- What, are you scared of heights?
- No. No.
I like coming up here.
I like coming here to be by myself.
But today I wanted to share it with you.
Hmm. I'm honored.
Sit with me?
I haven't given you a chance.
- But you're still here.
- Um, I can't leave, remember?
Tell me. Were you serious?
What?
When you said I could get better.
I said that? When?
- Piss off!
- Of course you can.
- But you have to really want it.
- Seriously, Adri? All that shit again?
- "You have to really want it."
- Okay.
I want it. I want it. I want it. I... I do!
How could I not, Adri?
Things were just fine here.
Then you showed up.
You... you told me I could have what I want.
- I thought I'd never have...
- You can.
You know what?
I think you connected
with someone for the first time,
and you have no idea what to do.
You're scared.
- No, I'm not scared.
- Yes.
You tell people
you can only spend one night with them.
Anything else scares you.
The night we met,
you said relationships always fail.
The more you know someone,
the worse it gets, but it's not true.
- The more I know you...
- Don't say it.
...the more I like you.
Guys, this is a center for mental health.
Ugh! Get a room!
- Tina, I'm sorry.
- All right.
- I promise it'll never happen again.
- We're sorry, Tina.
Half an hour. That's it.
Half an hour?
Hello.
Hi.
- Wait.
- What is it?
I can't do this.
We don't have to do anything.
I just wanna be near you.
Okay.
- Good night.
- Don't you mean "good morning"?
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

Good morning, peanut butter!
Mmm.
- Time to wake up.
- One more minute, okay?
Has it been a minute?
Come on!
- Adri, get up!
- One second.
- Adri, I'm kind of in a hurry. Please.
- Okay.
Adri, wake the fuck up! Whoa!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry, but I need to tell you something.
Sorry, but Saúl's up already,
and he's gonna eat all the jelly.
Mmm.
Do you know why
all the people in here love jelly so much?
It's because being able to see
through your food is cool.
What's up? What does that look mean?
- Uh, you're a little excited, aren't you?
- Excited? No, I'm...
...happy.
Happy, happy, happy!
Thanks to you.
Don't I look good?
You look amazing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You want a closer look?
It's a bit early.
It's a bit what? It's a bit what?
For Jelly, Carla! What the hell?
Whoo!
Talk about a morning person. Damn.
Let's do this, folks.
I'm feeling lucky today, let me tell you.
Hey, Adri! Adri!
I had a great idea.
You should use this pack of cards, okay?
Not the rigged ones Carla usually uses.
Deck of cards, sure,
but isn't Carla with you?
No.
Nobody is ever with me.
- Marta, you've seen Carla?
- No, I haven't seen her at all yet today.
Uh, I'm gonna look. You deal.
Seriously?
- They are so gonna do it.
- Thanks for your vote of confidence.
Carla?
Carla?
Adri?
What are you doing?
I need to show you something
I just discovered.
I can see past the mountains.
The sea is there.
For real. Come and look.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm better than okay.
I just found this. You need to come here
so I can share it with you.
It's right there!
- Are you taking your medication?
- No. No.
No, and I'm better than I've ever been
because you told me I could do it,
and now I know I can. I can feel it.
I can. That's why I see it out there.
It's... it's almost out of reach,
but I can't see it from here.
If you come here,
maybe you can see it too.
Please, please come here!
- The sea's out there!
- Okay, come on.
- Ah! Hey!
- Hey! Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay. Easy.
What the fuck, Adri?
I just need you to see what I see
when I look out there
past the mountains, huh?
I need you to get it, Adri!
I need you to understand...
Yeah, she'll be fine. Just a little bump.
So, she needs to rest.
Of course. I understand.
She's been off her meds for days.
Hey.
Hi.
What is this?
Is that an IV?
Tell me she doesn't know.
I'm sorry, Carla. I had to.
No.
Who... who the hell do you think you are?
- No!
- Carla, I said I was...
- You have no right to mess up my life.
- No, no, no. Nurse, quick!
I have to start over because of you. No!
You told me, Adri.
You said I could do it.
You promised.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I...
Carla.
What is it?
Guys?
You tell us.
Ah.
Your article just came...
just came out this morning.
- Oh fuck!
- The outcasts of society, huh?
- The girl from The Exorcist?
- I can explain.
- Before I really knew you...
- You don't have to explain at all.
I hope you had lots of fun
with your experiment.
- No!
- Adri, fuck... fuck you!
- And that wasn't my Tourette's.
- Wait. Wait.
- Let's find another table.
- No.
Saúl, I...
THE TRASH OF SOCIETY
So...
...you were telling the truth.
Well, I'm feeling a bit stupid, honestly.
I'm sorry.
I'm giving you permission
to leave here immediately.
One more thing.
Carla,
it was all my fault.
Adri, do you know why I have to be
so strict letting people come and go?
Well, I'm guessing
to stop assholes like me?
Well, in part.
But also because most visitors,
they want to help their loved ones
and believe they know how.
Look, I've got two degrees
and three master's,
and it might seem hard to believe,
but in the majority of cases,
I'm much more effective
than those who try to fix someone
with good intentions or love.
They bring themselves here
and believe they'll get better, but no.
We help patients
to live with themselves as they are,
and that takes a long time.
Right.
We encourage them not to pretend
to be better for the benefit of others.
Adri, the toughest thing
about being mentally ill
is that others
want you to pretend that you're not.
I have to get back to work now.
That was pretty impressive.
I think it's a good idea.
I really do. Sure.
I'm sure about it.
I just want you to be happy,
to make sure this is right for you.
Your husband?
Your husband think this is a good idea?
I don't care.
I don't think this is bad for her, Saúl.
Is it true that you don't feel well?
Mm-hmm.
Can I have a Band-Aid?
Aw.
Is that a... What a good idea.
What a great idea!
All better now. See?
Adri!
Come on.
Come here.
Sara, this is my very good friend.
He's a spy, you know?
So, are we still friends?
Sure!
Perhaps, uh...
Perhaps I'm being paranoid...
but I can't help but think
that you played a part
in all of this and helped me out.
Paranoid, maybe,
but you're a good man, Saúl.
I can neither confirm
nor deny that statement.
Is he crazy too?
- Sara!
- That's right, honey.
He's crazy too,
but he doesn't know it.
Thank you.
Take care, eh?
Hey, honey?
May I have another Band-Aid, please?
I think I need a double dose.
As you already know,
I had gotten myself admitted
into a mental health center.
What you didn't know
is that I did it to save a woman.
I wanted to get her out,
to get her as far away from those freaks
and that place as I could.
I didn't get it right away.
Maybe because it's complicated
or probably
because I'm dumber than I thought.
But that woman didn't need
an idiot like me to save her
like some modern-day Prince Charming.
I want her to know,
even though I understand
we can't be together,
I'm always going to be
madly in love with her.
As I'm sure you can guess,
I'm definitely no expert,
but I think I learned at least a bit
from my time there.
Thank you.
And, for whatever it's worth,
I wanted to share that.
"I want her to know,
even though I understand
that we can't be together,
I am always going to be
madly... madly in love with her."
My God, I can't believe it.
Carla!
What?
Was anyone else even listening
to that shit?
You know it's not shit.
He's a linguistic genius.
It's a masterpiece!
- Both grammatically and semantically!
- Semantically.
- Those epithets. Oh!
- The epithets, yes!
It's beautiful.
Beautiful?
I've never heard
so much bullshit in my life!
Where are you going?
That asshole needs to hear
a thing or two. Let's go.
- Saúl, keep reading.
- Let me find my place.
"For whatever it's worth,
I wanted to share that."
- "I wanted to try..."
- Hey!
You're all coming too.
Are you crazy? You want us to break out?
Yep.
Here they teach us
how we can manage ourselves.
But at the same time, we need
to be able to show them who we really are.
The next time
we're let out into the real world,
we've gotta be prepared
for whatever happens.
- Brace yourselves. She's losing it.
- She needs lithium.
She's having another episode.
First, we need lithium.
Marta's right.
Barrels of lithium. It's the only way.
Lithium, okay.
- We were thinking that maybe you need...
- Shh! You better be in. You owe me one.
- Are you flaring up just a little bit?
- This much?
A flare-up?
This isn't some episode I'm having
This is so much bigger
than anything I've ever done.
What about you, Marta?
What are you going to do
when someone laughs at one of your tics?
And you, Víctor,
are you ready to face a world
without your beloved soap?
Tina, don't you think that it's time
for the princess to meet with her people?
To lead them
and to show every single one of them
that being sad sometimes is okay.
Okay if you're a princess or a commoner
or someone whose life
is full of sadness.
And Sergio...
- You're good?
- I'm perfect!
Yeah!
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
You know, we need to get...
- We're gonna need a distraction.
- We should've done this yesterday.
- What?
- Fuck, I have depression stress.
- This is not good for me.
- What kind of bird is that?
Can everyone focus for one second
so we can get out of here?
- I have an idea.
- What?
- I'm on it!
- Where's he going? Where are you going?
Fucker!
- Remember me!
- You know I will. Bitch!
Seriously?
I'm starting to panic!
Think calming thoughts.
We're all gonna die but not today.
Now breathe.
- I'm looking for my soap.
- You're not allowed to be here.
- I need my soap.
- Now!
No, Víctor,
I've told you this many times...
I don't ask for much...
Listen to me, Víctor,
it's not good for your condition.
- I'm not wasting it...
- Ah...
Azalea! Ah! Hippie!
- Oh shit.
- What are they doing?
- Motherf...
- Get away from there!
- We just need it for a minute!
- Hey!
- Come on, Carla!
- No! Wait! Be careful!
Carla is on a mission!
- Hey! Turn around!
- It's very important!
- Víctor, I think I love you a bit.
- I love you a bit too, honey!
- This is insane!
- Be back soon!
- Get the police on the phone, now!
- No, no, no. no! Let me drive.
- Go left.
- Stop pointing right with your head, then.
Come on, quick! Stay with them!
One million clicks in two days.
Our best ever article,
and it's all thank to you, maestro.
A million clicks in two days?
Give me a kiss.
Give me a damn kiss. Come on!
Hey!
Let's not go crying to HR!
Everyone's just such a snowflake.
- Saúl, stop!
- Saúl!
- Hello!
- Stop the van!
- Come down.
- No, don't!
Don't move, you'll kill yourself.
Be back for dinner!
No, no, no! Watch out!
- My God!
- I saw my whole life flash before my eyes.
Okay, people,
here's what we're gonna do.
We need to focus
on the really trendy topics,
shit the average idiot is dying
to read about,
like feminism and all that garbage.
Everybody,
let's put some ideas on the board.
Hey! Hey, buddy!
Move it, asshole!
- Can I cut them off now?
- No, no, no! No passing.
Follow them.
Follow them while keeping us alive, okay?
Fuck, man, learn to drive!
Look out for the car!
The fucking car!
I'm gay!
- You're gay?
- Who are you? What was I saying? I forget.
- Can I cut them off now?
- Sure, cut them off.
Let me signal,
accelerate...
Okay, feminism. What else?
How about LGBTQ equality?
- Huh?
- The community? LGBTQ?
Homos. Great.
- So, we lost them.
- Rosa, please!
- What? We did.
- They're still in front of us.
- Without my glasses, I can't see shit.
- What? You wear glasses?
Ever since I was 13,
but I don't like to wear them.
The things make me look old.
Rosa, get you goddamn glasses!
What else? Uh...
- Recycling, planet stuff...
- Ecology?
- Um...
- Pollution.
- A buzz word.
- Climate change.
- Climate change.
- Climate change.
- Greta Thunberg.
- Huh?
- Greta Thunberg.
- No, no. Climate change. Nothing weird.
You know how they make you have
five different bins in your kitchen now?
Tell me. Any of you really do it?
Ah, thanks.
Wait, these are my sunglasses.
Not these.
Black people, Muslims...
- Immigration?
- Well, if we must.
Okay.
Gotcha.
Yeah, these glasses. I'll pop them on.
There! That is them!
- Take that and some of these!
- Saúl, what the hell?
- Is that toilet paper? You serious?
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- This is going into the book!
- No! Give me the book!
Adri, that stuff you were into...
The stigmatization of mental illness.
Ah right! Crazies!
- Get back! Get back!
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no!
- Whoo!
Topic.
- My topic?
- That's right.
What's my topic?
Oh, come on, you know.
This guy with this guy
and that girl and even with a bookshelf.
You call that...
Nymphomania?
Nymphomaniacs. Plural.
No, but... but it's not...
Nymphomaniacs. Not just one anymore.
Nothing's black or white today, you know?
That's just, uh...
That's diversity, yeah.
- There you go!
- Saúl!
- Stop.
- Saúl, please don't do that.
Sleep time! Sleep time!
Time to go to sleep!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!
- My, that was a...
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
Don't throw up in here, please.
- That's better.
- Get some fresh air.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Tina and I are not comfortable
at all back there.
You're driving very erratically.
Okay.
Quique, you're...
You know...
Uh...
You know...
Dru... drugs?
Exactly.
- Prevention?
- No, no, not prevention.
- Drugs.
- Drugs.
Drugs. I bet that you could write
about it by heart.
Okay.
Good afternoon?
Excuse me. Where are you going?
Hello. Good afternoon.
We're here to... to see, uh, Adrián Mallo.
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.
No, but Adrián said
we could always stop by, see him anytime.
Well, he's in a meeting right now,
so no, it won't be possible.
- Of course it is. She's here with me.
- You are?
Are you kidding me?
- Uh, sorry.
- Oh, come on.
I'm sorry.
There must've been a misunderstanding.
I'm royalty, you hear me?
If you don't let us through,
your boss is gonna be very mad at you.
She's, uh, royalty?
We're in. The future queen
of Spain is too. I repeat, going in.
- Bitch.
- Okay, everyone out! Let's go!
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh! You keep your hands off me! I'm nuts.
- This is crazy.
- Adri!
Pedophilia is now, uh...
Well, I'll put it
in the maybe column. What else?
- Adri!
- Adri!
Adri! Hey!
- Adri!
- Adri! Adri! Adri!
Carla?
- Adri?
- Let them through.
What are you doing here? They let you out?
No.
So I'll have to be quick.
Okay, what's up?
Whoa, I can neither confirm
or deny that this will be quick.
Really I have no idea.
What is this shit?
My article?
You... you didn't like it?
This cheesy shit?
I nearly puked.
But that's what I would expect
from this piece of shit magazine.
Hey, show some respect, please.
Carla, what's wrong?
He's asking what's wrong?
What's wrong is this garbage
about how we can't be together.
But that came from you.
You didn't want to be with me.
Well, I've change my mind! I'm bipolar!
Is this how you fight for me?
This is all you'll do
to fight for the woman that you love?
Smooth, man, really smooth.
This is what I have to say
to you and your article. Watch.
But... but, Carla...
The magazine may be crap,
but the paper is high-quality.
For the record,
I don't need to be saved.
- By you or anyone.
- That's what the article's about!
I know that!
But don't fucking ask me
to save you from me either, okay?
Okay, Carla.
Okay what?
You're right.
I don't need you to save me from you.
I want to be with you.
- It won't be easy.
- Yeah, well, that's my problem.
Yeah, but you're gonna try to change me.
I won't let you.
Nobody changes me.
Not you or anyone else.
I love you as you are.
Some days I'll
get a euphoric episode out of nowhere.
I know.
And some days I'll want to die.
I know that too.
But there will be others
when I'll want to kill you.
Okay.
Wow, but... some days
I'll want you kill you so badly,
so badly that I'll almost do it.
Yep!
- Almost?
- Things will never be normal.
Yeah.
All of it.
Are you crazy or what?
Did I ever tell you
I was in an institution?
The next time
I see someone who looks sad,
I won't ask them to smile...
or promise them that they can get better.
If I truly want to help them...
I'll try to let them know
that, while I may not understand
what they're going through,
I'll be there if they need me.
- You know, you can come in if you want.
- No, no, no!
One second! Give me one second.
Excuse me, do you have a pen?
Thanks.
It's 639-35-10-11.
Carla.
Okay? So you don't forget.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Get in,
get my phone number, and...
- And get out?
- I'll call you when you get out, okay?
As soon as you get out.
- Bye.
- Bye.
