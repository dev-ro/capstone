Good morning, Sir! Can I help you?
Good morning! I'd like a necklace.
Yes...
Over there... that one...
This... is, let me say, a bracelet,
you have pointed at the bracelet sir...
A bracelet, oh, yes.
Ok, well... so let me see a bracelet then.
Here you are, sir.
Bracelet... hmm...
No, no. Definitely no.
Can you show me an elegant necklace?
These are necklaces? Are you sure?
Absolutely, beyond a doubt.
I know my job very well.
I've been working as a jeweler
for 24 years.
Oh, I see... and, excuse me,
could I see this ring?
Did I say it correctly, this is a ring,
isn't it?
You are absolutely right!
Now that everything is so beautiful
let me take it all.
Everything? How so, sir...
May I take the liberty to point out
that the cost of all these
pieces amounts to three thousand three
hundred zlotys.
So will you please add something else
for seven hundred zloty
to make an equal sum?
But something elegant, you know...
I'm at your service, sir...
Do you like it?
What is it?
A brooch.
Yes... and do you know what it is?
Yes, well, what is it?
Silencer.
Oh, I see. I don't see what you mean...
Will you wrap it up right away
or shall I fix it to a gun?
So it means...
That this is probably...
A robbery.
Sure, it stands to reason.
You had better not touch the alarm, any
clever tricks. It's unhealthy.
Smile, smile as usual, and wrap it up.
This...
Turn around and look for something
in the bottom drawer.
When you'll reckon up to one hundred
then you can turn around, but no sooner
Does anybody sell here?
Does anybody sell here?
Thirty two...
Oh my God! Rychlinski!
Maybe he lives!?
Jesus, so young!
Thanks for remembering.
He's walking out today.
He has to walk out sometimes.
Thank you, you are free.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Kramer's Banking House...
" Forget-me-not ",
please switch off the alarm system.
The treasury.
See you.
Oh God! Henry!
Come in, come in Henry,
and come in please!
Henry, Henry, I'm glad
you are already at liberty
Dinner is just ready; you know
I'll serve something hot in a minute.
It's so long I've come to see you last
because I was a little ill.
I didn't tell you I'd been at my aunt's
place in Skierniewice
for two weeks because my uncle had died.
Yes...
Anyway I should have introduced you
to one another.
Henry, this is Mr...
My name is Karmelicki...
I'm very glad.
So I, I'll go and bring some table-ware.
I won't be long.
Sit down Henry, stay here.
Oh, at last to dinner.
What are you doing with that chair!
Stop it!
Do you hear? Have you become idiot?
Stop it!
Are you looking for a cab?
We can give you a lift.
I'm sure we go the same way.
Excuse me, Sir! Sir!
I'm going to the president.
But I...
But I'm going to the president!
Please, I must get in!
But sir, I've told you.
Let me in please!
But I...
I must get in at once!
You can't sir.
Please, sir, Mr. President is busy.
Go away.
But...
Mr. President... hands off!
Mr. President, you must hear me out.
Your tellers don't want to pay me out my
money.
What is it? Don't get excited.
Take it easy.
Mr. President, my name is Jan Rozek.
I have deposited in your bank all my
savings, and those dirty dogs,
sorry, your tellers, don't want
to pay them out.
Damn it! Isn't that a reason
to get excited?
My dear man. Will you stop roaring?
Don't insult my employees.
Mr. Majer...
This gentleman's name - as he says it
himself is Rozek
and he want to withdraw the money
from Mr. Kowalski's account, so...
Well, yes...
We can't pay out.
Well. Well. I'm very sorry,
but the money from Mr. Kowalski's account
can be withdrawn by Mr. Kowalski only.
Yes, but I...
Of course...
What? Why do you keep silent?
But... that was you who advised me
to pay my money under a false name,
you who told me that there are a lot of
Kowalski's
and anybody would find out who is who, and
I... and I wouldn't
have to pay tax on this sum.
That's what you've said.
You told me it would be a gentleman's
agreement.
Did you really advise our buyer a
gentleman's agreement?
Mr. President, I do nothing
that you don't know about.
On the other hand that's not nice of you
to try to cheat
the tax collector's office.
What? I...
Yes.
How so? What? An honest Pole like me,
just because I've invested
money in your bank.
And I didn't want to support
foreign capital?
Do you want to take me in?
You... you robbers, cads! But...
You'll pay for this, you scoundrels!!!
You can't get away with that...!
Thank goodness ours is
a legally governed country.
I'll, I'll bring an action against you,
and you too.
Mr. Rozek, you've gone too far with that
shooting.
But if you slip away right now and stop
talking nonsense...
I won't call the police. Go out. OK?
But my money!
Take him off!
My money!
Get out!!
But... but...
What is it?
Everything's quite all right. Go back to
your work, quietly.
Gentleman's agreement.
How did you think it out?
Mr. Sawicki? How much was it?
Six thousand.
Well, well!
To your happy liberation!
Why happy? In due time.
So it is. But mind you don't say,
think that everybody set at liberty
we give such rousing welcome.
Only you!
You're Henry Kwinto,
the most outstanding safe-breaker in the
Republic.
Do I look like a safe-breaker? I'm a
musician.
And you've worked out for bigamy, eh?
He! Ha!
Yes.
Lvov 1924, Polish National Bank 1925,
Lodz, Swiss Loan Bank
in nineteen twenty six...
Seven.
Bydgoszcz in nineteen twenty seven.
Country bank in nineteen twenty eight,
National Farm Bank.
I've mentioned only the most important
performances of yours.
Mr. Musician!
Caught once in 1928, six years in prison
only because
the rest hasn't been substantiated.
What do you want?
Cooperation.
We have a few excellent ideas...
Cheers!
Cheers!
You're not drinking to us?
Nuta, show him!
You've taken me for somebody else.
Do you know what it is?
Silencer.
Will you say yes or shall he
fix it to a gun?
And do you know what this is? This is a
mouthpiece.
What?
Of a trumpet.
What trumpet?
I'm a musician.
Ok.
When you... if you would like
to play with us
come to the workshop at Okopowa Street.
Tinsmith - vulcanization.
You've been opening safes
not using tools, but ear only.
What safes?
Stop it Moks!
Moks!
What then?
What then?
This is the last scheme of yours.
Not any more. It's not him.
What shall we do with him?
What?
Damn it! We have to drive him back.
Sure we have to do it.
May he go to the hell!
A single room please.
I'm sorry but...
Here you are.
Hallo!
You haven't changed at all.
May I?
Aren't you interested
what there is inside?
Oh, I would like you to treat it as a
business not personal matter.
After all, we both are businessmen.
Have you ever thought of what would have
happened
if I had told at court about your share?
Nothing would have happened because it
hadn't been a share,
provocation only.
As you can see I'm quite frank with you,
Do you remember my case
... the case with false securities? The
criminal police kept a sharp eye on me.
I don't know how a police officer
happened to know about our connections
and he has made me squeal.
They forced me to cause a burglary
and to put you into a trap.
Catching Kwinto red-handed was a feat.
They have been teaching about you
at police school by then.
It wasn't an easy thing to do.
We were friends after all.
Try to understand me Kwinto,
if they landed me in jail,
it would've been the end to everything.
Career, health, everything.
And you already had a bad reputation.
This is cruel. Cruel, that was
the only way I reasoned out them.
You can't undo the past.
But this parcel would make things
easier for you.
Forty five thousand Polish zlotys.
Look! Forty five thousand!
Twice as many as you would have
taken then.
I've been in jail for twenty two thousand
one hundred ninety six days,
that makes about twenty zlotys a day.
You've tot it up... cheap.
Honestly I think. Now understand me!
I've been uneasy in my mind about it
for six years.
At least I'd like to settle all these fair
to the end.
I've done with it, with the past.
I'm an honest man.
Today I can be honest
because I have money.
You honest man! In the cell... I was
dreaming of this moment all the time.
You've thought it out nicely!
Ok, today
let's be even.
You had the right to do it.
I forgive you.
Should you have any troubles come over
without hesitation.
You'd better not leave your address.
Ha! Ha! Ha! I've taken your hint.
Nothing doing!
It's impossible to rob my bank.
Herring's ear! I know a thing or two.
You know it.
Then what? As you've said
we are even Kwinto?
You'd have only lost your time.
Herring's ear!
"Spiety" called on me yesterday.
Understand?
"Spiety" called on me yesterday.
Understand?
He keeps something in mind.
He is looking for a team.
If I had know I would have
recommended you. So what?
Shall I call him up?
Arrange it with him?
Safe. No risk.
Weltmajstertszaft.
How much?
Even 250.
I'm, asking about the Fiat.
Let's make it 4, especially for you,
do you stand?
Hydraulic brakes.
"Spool", I've bought a car from you.
What else do you want?
I want you to think it over.
For the past six years
I've been thinking all the time
and I've thought it out that
that's enough.
They've cut your hair
and your balls as well?
So what? Will you go?
Boss!
So what am I to say to Spiety?
Tell him to unfasten.
They've set you free?
Is Tadeusz in?
No.
May I wait? I've come here
because Tadeusz wrote to me.
To you? What for?
When will he come back?
Tadeusz is dead.
What?
Don't you understand? He is dead!!
How did it happen?
That's no business of yours.
Tadeusz is my friend.
He was. He was your friend.
And that's just the thing I can't
understand
since I've learnt who you really are.
What has happened to Tadeusz?
Tadeusz decided to
deposit all our money at
interest in the bank.
All, all nineteen thousand.
When he was on his way home
they robbed and beat him.
They took the payment
receipt away from him.
Tadeusz couldn't withdraw his money
from the bank because...
he had got the bill to the bearer.
What bank was it?
I don't know. Next day he threw himself
from the window.
The police told it had been a suicide.
Tadeusz? Suicide?
Take it.
I know Tadeusz would like you to
have it.
Listen, Kwinto.
Tell me,
was Tadeusz also
...was he like you?
You needn't worry. He wasn't.
Go away now.
Get away.
"Kwinto! They are following me -
that's why I'm writing this.
I know now how Kramer took over the bank.
Details to be found in a gray suitcase.
Tadeusz"
Not worth a fart.
It looks like a qui pro quo.
It ought to have been
hammered out better.
Hammered out? You'd better hammer you
running in pate you blockhead.
What?
Wait till the boss sees it.
He'll give us a car.
You'll ride on your ass on
an unshaven board.
Running in. And who has hit it, who?
This is the last time you've taken the
wheel, the last time.
Have you seen?
Mr. Musician.
I say, you're rigged out
like a caretaker.
First, you'll sell my car -
five thousand, and you'll do it today.
Secondly, you'll look for Dane, his last
address, that's for tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow we'll meet by the
front door at Smutna Street at two.
How about...
I don't want any ideas of yours,
thirdly.
How did you manage to get in?
You should have been more careful.
A parcel for you Mr. President.
Check up what else is inside it.
Check up what else is inside it.
Dough, Mr. President.
Forty five thousand?
Yes, how do you know?
Oh, here is something else.
Is it that Rychlinski? The one who was
playing together with Kwinto in one band?
Rychlinski, Kwinto, yes, yes,
in nineteen twenty six, twenty seven in
one of the cabarets.
Couldn't you have checked it beforehand?
Ask Krepicz to come over here.
Yes, sir!
Damn it!
Good morning.
I can't be bothered.
Have a cigar, lease.
No, please, I beg you no, I beg you no,
please no.
NO, this pistol is not good.
How so? Not good?
I've specially borrowed it from my
brother-in-law who is a policeman.
It's real Browning.
What is it again Mr. Turwid?
Are you scared? Why? It's not loaded.
You know it perfectly well that I'm not
afraid, that's beside the point, director.
I just don't wish it.
Everything is imitation except the pistol,
it's real, it just throws me off my mood.
Mood, mood. First you don't want to stay
under the bed and now the pistol.
What's the matter with you, Mr. Turwid?
Have I engaged an actor or an old woman?
Director, I won't stand it.
The dressing room is dirty; there are no
towels, no soap. The wig doesn't fit.
Director, I was at my brother-in-law's
place specially...
Ok, bring a dummy for Mr. Turwid
and ten minutes break.
Thank you.
What is it?
I would like to talk to the owner.
You're just doing it.
Mr. Kwinto would like
to play football with you.
What?
Football.
I play tennis only. Who is Mr. Kwinto?
You are not Dane?
Dane?
I saw him for the last time four years ago
when I bought this business from him.
It was difficult to call it
a theatre then.
Now our standard is not too bad. But who
will appreciate it,
only dilettanti everywhere.
Just a moment. Do you happen to know
where I can find him?
I hard he had bought
a cinema at Ziemianska.
Mr. Dane, of course I knew him, but he
sold the cinema two years ago or so.
What shall I do now?
I don't know, sir I sell tickets.
You'd better ask that man who lets
people in, they were on friendly terms.
We would like to get in touch
with Mr. Dane.
With Mr. Dane, yes say.
Yes...
I don't know the man.
Hm... that's strange. He has been your
employer for two years.
Has he? I don't remember.
Maybe I was ill then.
And now?
Now I'm well.
Do you think we are cops?
It's none of my business; either you
come in or clear out, good bye.
Good bye. We've already seen that film.
Good morning, sir.
Things stand as follows.
Dane had sold his vaudeville
four years ago and he bought
a cinema which in turn he sold
two years ago and now he has a business.
At present we don't know what kind of
business.
Anyway, if he is consistent
he should sell it this year.
I've even looked over some ads.
Oh, here, for example:
"I'll urgently sell a "fotoplasticon".
Todays?
Offers? Yes.
Over there, at the top if you please.
Curious.
Eh?
We play with Victoria today.
Nothing doing! We've got a licking 3:0
in Berlin. We stand no chance to win.
Nobody knows... maybe...
How are things going, Dane?
Kwinto here?
It's nice to look at you.
You've grown manly.
It's hard to recognize you.
Hard to find you.
Too many people look for me.
Luckily you don't change your likes and
dislikes so many times as your addresses.
But only a few people know it.
Me, for example.
How many years is it? Four?
Six.
We'll go for a drive to bank and back.
It's a long time since we met last time
you don't know...
What is, eh?
That I've resigned.
Me too, but this time it's something
extraordinary.
How much do we have to draw out?
Everything.
I'm asking put of curiosity
because I turn down.
At my age the demand for profit
goes down
and the demand for quietude goes up.
Forgive me Kwinto, but you're talking
with the man who has retired.
Dane, I must do it. Together with you.
By yourself! By yourself!
It's not the same team.
They'll do nothing.
Bolek wait!
He lost consciousness.
Let's go. The police will be here
in a minute.
Como on, be quick,
What's up here, excuse me, excuse me.
My God! Blood!
Stand back!
On the field you looked
as if somebody has aimed at you.
I won't say no..
Are you in a hole?
Gustaw Kramer Banking House Co.
Kredytowa St 6
Wait! Isn't it the same Kramer
who helped the police to nab you?
The same. Now he has helped my friend
to end his days
taking all his money away from him.
Oh yes, I see. And what was it
that you had in mind... What scheme?
Va Bank.
Leave metaphors alone.
Do you remember Szwanderski's case?
In Cracow in 1924?
Ha, ha! Sure. Well conceived.
But it didn't work out.
I will carry it off.
Aha! Gustaw Kramer. He knows all about
alarms, doesn't he?
He has worked in bank
Can't you take your revenge on somebody
else? He's a crafty fellow, isn't he?
Has he any weak points at all?
Do you know him?
Yes, I do.
It needs at least two or more
for you scheme to be carried out.
Yes, I do.
Do I know them?
No.
What have they been doing?
Once, a jeweler...
Shop lifters.
But they are very eager.
Because they haven't worked out.
And that's very good.
We can't show up too much.
Ha! Ha! A guy who is an expert in alarms
and two eager shop lifters.
And I have only to come into play.
As if I were dribbling the ball
across the whole field,
passed it and you only ready to shoot...
is it so?
Make yourself clear.
I would have to be seriously ill
to accept it.
And you know that I don't feel well
lately. Have a look.
The last chance. I'm, selling it soon.
Ha! Ha! The next ones
will be even better.
The first one from the left... hm?
Take it and check up the returns
once again... OK?
Excuse me, Mr. President.
What's the matter?
One of the women tellers says
that this man was here yesterday.
Dane? I've completely forgotten that he
exists at all.
There has been no news of him
for the last few years.
He has placed his money
in our bank today.
Maybe he simply started to save up.
Maybe.
You have to find out where he lives and
watch him.
Who does he meet... where does he eat?
Everything.
Ok.
Right.
Ok
Let's start up and here,
Krepicz, Kramer's
guy doing messy work...
seven years in the Foreign Legion.
He has dispatched more people
than you've eaten chops...
and this is the bank on the first floor.
There is a restaurant, below, open
at the time when the bank is closed.
There's nothing to be done here.
Private flat.
And just towards the end...
And the most difficult thing-the alarm
system.
Unfortunately they have
the best possible. Swiss Zeigler.
In case of the alarm it blocks all exits
and of course the police is
informed immediately.
Inside it you can't even open a box of
matches not to switch on the alarm.
Is it possible to block it?
Each one can be blocked, only you
have to do it the first time....
And even if I succeed in breaking this
system the first time,
in order to block it
I have to get inside.
And all entrances are under cover of
installation.
So called squaring of the circle.
I've got it! We get in barefacedly
in broad daylight, take out our guns,
aim at the tellers and grab the money.
Nuta would be standing near the door.
Kwinto, Kwinto! Who is it?
Ignore them.
I've almost forgotten the two watchmen
who take turns
four times a day
every twenty four hours.
So we have at least six hours!
Bravo! Bravo! You are right,
but there is no chance to get in.
No chances?
Hardly any.
Hardly...
There is one. Otherwise I wouldn't wag
my tongue.
Have a good look at this plan...
What can you see?
Which way?
This way...
Holy cow!
Excuse me, could you call up my dad,
please. My car has broken down.
Of course I can. But there's no need to
bother your dad.
I can help you too.
Fine... I don't have the slightest idea
how to repair it.
Have you got necessary tools?
Yes.
So let me set to work.
Is it anything serious?
I don't know yet.
What's your name?
Natalia.
You're spoiled your face.
... Higher up, on your little nose, OK.
Switch off that wretched staff! Damn it!
What are you waiting for?
Switch off that shit!
... damn it. It's really Swiss.
Polish invention.
Everything is clear or shall I repeat
something?
Everything is clear.
Let's set to work and tomorrows don't le
Kramer out of your sight.
Yap, we keep an eye on him for the whole
week. You don't need worry.
See you tomorrow.
So long.
I didn't want to talk in the presence of
your shop lifters,
but can't Kramer guess that we scheme
against him?
I gave him to understand it.
To be more painful.
But for whom? I don't say you are a unlucky
chap but you've been out of luck lately.
That's why I've asked you because
I don't know any luckiest man.
The second one was my brother, but
he got drowned when he was three...
Just in case, move from your hotel.
Too many people know you live there.
If they want to find me they will.
There's no help for it.
In case something happens
you can use it. Not bad.
But take this one as well.
When we come off victorious
I think I'll get drunk.
And now our last partner...
it blocks Zeigler's Swiss installation.
This wretched plate?
Ziegler und Sohn would be furious
if they could hear it.
Play without me.
I'm sorry I've asked you to come here.
I always liked to come here,
you know it.
You've resumed your work?
Thanks for coming.
Will you have something to drink?
No, thank you.
Cocktail and the usual.
I happen to know the public prosecutor
well and few police officers.
They promised to take Tadeusz's
case in hand.
If it proves necessary they will
renew the investigation.
If it turns out that somebody has helped
Tadeusz in this suicide,
you'll get compensation.
Tadeusz had life insurance,
I know that money won't bring him back
but you deserve them.
Why do you do it, Kwinto?
I don't believe in Tadeusz's suicide.
I'm grateful to you.
What for? You know...
Thank you.
Stay...
If somebody ask about me
on Saturday tell him
I was playing with you
on Friday evening.
OK.
Roses please... all...
Thank you.
He calls it a day three hours earlier.
Small blame to him.
You're indecently punctual.
This is in a way the attribute of my
profession.
Champagne! What occasion is it?
Already a week, time for celebration,
I'm sorry, I've kept you waiting.
I had to change.
How'd you like it here?
Horribly, this is the right word.
This is my dad's flat. I move here
when he is out on business.
Oh, I see!
Setzen Sie bitte!
... Pardon?
Setzen Sie bitte. Do you remember our
agreement?
You were to help me with my German.
Ah, ja naturlich, ich habe vergessen.
I'm sorry I've forgotten.
Kafe, Tee...
Kafe, Tee, Nein, danke... champagne.
Wer ist das?
Das ist mein papa.
The firm Agricultural Machines
Bielecki and Holzwebris your dad's?
Bielecki only, Holzweber is my uncle...
when really say something...
I have a sense of humor, haven't I?
I think this necklace doesn't suit me.
Why, it's very beautiful.
Could you please help me to unbuckle.
Certainly, it will be a real pleasure!
I can't manage it.
You have to press hard.
Oh, you are right.
Ja langasam, langsam ober Siecher.
Oh, I didn't recognize you.
Never mind. I'll be rich.
Now let's go and fetch Kwinto...
You are in a hurry, aren't you? It seems
you'll be late after all.
Police. We have orders to take you
to the police station.
Why me?
Mr. Kwinto, you can be taken merely
for your name...
I think you don't have the right.
Sure, we have.
For 48 hours everybody....
Unless you are a Member of Parliament,
you know.
Wake up!
What the deuce!
Kwinto is missing.
How so? I've already forget the holes.
What shall we do?
What? Let's wait. Aren't all right here?
But what have you put on,
you shop lifter,
it's a raid not a market.
Good evening Mr. Kwinto.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting...
Sit down please.
You know I've looked through
every drawer,
but the dough was only in one of them.
But you're probably wondering why we've
called you in here.
Last night there was a break
in Walenty's desk,
and to tell you the truth,
you sir are still number one.
Do you recognize this man?
Is it Mr. Walenta's lawyer?
Are you joking...
it's Adam Szpulski, called Spool.
He sells cars.
I don't know him.
Ok, and this one?
No I don't know him.
No. This is Bernard Malkiewicz,
better known by the name of "Spiety".
I don't know him.
Hard lines! Anyway you are lucky.
They've settled Walenta's hash not you.
They caught them carrying traps at the
time when you were being driven here.
You've been fortunate this time.
I would rather say you were not fortunate.
But you've spoiled my evening.
That's what comes of your famous past.
But perhaps I could make good
before we meet again.
Six o'clock and what now?
We should have begun half an hour ago in
order to manage it.
Let's go down.
Damn it! Those holes. They can
guess something was going on here.
What a pity, hell! What a pity!
Ok let's go. We won't sit here
or else we can a lupus.
Police!!!
Have they come to fetch us?
What shall we do? Scoot off?
Stay, stay.
Kwinto! Kwinto!
I knew he would come.
We were scared stiff.
What has come over you?
I've overslept.
I withdraw... here...
.. hmm...
Do you hear that?
Have I heard what?
Who can be here? And I...
And I... God helps them
who help themselves.
Olek, drop it! They are playing
downstairs, in the restaurant.
Occupied.
Oh... sorry... a... a...
Olek, we're playing now.
Can I?
Yes, you can.
How have you done it?
You'd better pay attention.
Let's load it up!
What card is it, Natalia?
The king of spades.
Bravo! And now?
The ace of diamonds.
And now?
How intelligent you are. I set the highest
value on the intelligence of women.
Be a gentleman, Gustaw.
I will be, I will be.
Did you take along everything?
You needn't worry.
We'll learn about it in the newspaper
tomorrow.
What is it?
What?
There are no fingerprints, officers.
Check it!
What's your judgment, engineer?
It's a very complicated system.
The current runs here.
Cutting off the circulation
switches on the alarm.
In order to avoid it one ought
to block the sensing device...
it should've been a circuit breaker
of this shape.
Excuse me, officer, we've found a
fingerprint on this plate.
I've just taken off the marks
and now I'm going to the office.
Just a minute! Take the fingerprints
of all the bank employees first.
Somebody else can rummage the files.
Yes, officer.
Could this circuit breaker
look like this?
Yes.
Yes, take it easy. Relax.
Yes, take it easy. Relax.
Don't help. We'll manage.
I don't help.
You see! Your friend wasn't afraid.
Officer, the owner Mr. Werner, has come.
Kramer.
Officer Przygoda
from the criminal Police.
Przygoda. It's a relief to know that
it's you who makes an investigation.
Were these two blockheads on duty?
Yes, Mr. President.
Dismissal!
How much was there in the safe?
585 Thousand in cash, and securities.
But how did they manage to get in? It's
impossible.
The alarm installation is never failing
switched off and supervised by the police.
They've broken through the ventilation shaft
from the restaurant which is below the bank.
Shaft... who would have thought
about it? Damn it!
But how is it possible to disconnect
such an installation, officer?
With the help of this plate!
In that case Ziegler
will pay me damages!
Get in touch with Krepicz at once.
I've tried Mr. President,
but without result.
It's been two weeks now
that he has vanished.
Vanished?
Could you open the safe?
Open? But it is broken open.
But could you?
Yes,
How much space did this
half million take up?
The bottom shelves - securities
and two top shelves banknotes in packets.
I see...
Mr. Sawicki, a cigarette...
Open the other section.
You know,
this rip makes possible to take
money from the middle shelf,
the top one is safe.
The hole doesn't reach it.
So where is the money?
I suppose the safe
had been opened normally
and only then it was broker to open to
deceive.
That's nonsense. What for should anybody
take such great pains...
To simulate a burglary for instance.
Simulate... Officer! You suggest that
somebody working in the bank has done it?
I told for example.
Anyway we have to take the fingerprints
of all the members of your staff,
starting with the watchman and ending
with you, Mr. President.
With me!
Well! Well! Maybe it was I who did it...
Maybe Mr. Sawicki stole my money.
How fortunate that you make an
investigation, officer.
I'm lucky. I'm glad.
Are the elders in?
Yes.
Mrs. Marta Rychlinska?
Yes, what is it?
I have money for you, madam.
Will you let me in?
Yes... but... come here
my little darling.
Good morning Madam.
Good morning... do come in.
Here is 20 thousand zloty for you Madam.
Will you please count them over.
That's a mistake.
I didn't understand where
is all this money coming from?
Why yes, it's surely for you.
No, no. Justysia, go and play
in the room. It's impossible, sir.
The president of the bank in which your
husband deposited money
turned out to be a crook.
Fortunately, we took it in hand and
as you can see we give the money
back to all suffering a loss.
Here you are.
Are you from the police?
Rather administration of justice. Please
acknowledge the receipt of this sum.
That's impossible sir.
I can't believe it.
Hm...
Yes, yes.
Do you act in consultation
with Mr. Kwinto?
Kwinto?
Yes.
Hm... Kwinto. I'm sorry...
Did he send you along here?
I'm sorry but I've never heard this name
before...
maybe he working
in a different department...
Thank you.
Good bye. Oh it's very important.
Good bye.
Thank you.
Everybody gets twenty thousand after
deducting the prime costs.
Yes, it's not so much...
I've already taken my share.
He! Ha! In my whole life I never
took part in such an idiotic raid.
Have we met all our obligations?
No, we've paid off everything
to the letter.
If I had got this money a month ago
I would have gone to Rome to see the
football championships.
You will go when the Polish team
will play.
So I'd have had to live
at least forty years more.
A hundred years...
Did you take your share for sure?
Who makes an investigation?
Officer Przygoda.
Very well, very well. Pedant.
Precisian.
He should already be there.
Your reason for hindering me
must have been extremely important.
Are you on a trail at least?
That's why I've come here.
That's why I've come here.
Fine, sit down please.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
We are, so to say, on duty.
It's a pity. I'll drink alone.
Do you remember this plate?
Well... you've already shown it to me.
I think it clocked
the alarm installation, didn't it?
That's right. We've found
fingerprints on it and
we even succeeded in identifying them.
I must, say you act very quickly.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much. Unfortunately,
Mr. Karmer, they are your fingerprints.
Congratulations... what?
Do you take me for a fool?
I've never in my life seen that damned
plate, let alone touching it.
Maybe these fingerprints
are similar to mine.
Mr. Kramer, dactyloscopy excludes beyond
a doubt two identical fingerprints.
That's why it's so important in fighting
criminals.
You are over-freeing. What do you
mix me up in? You just wait!
I'll accuse you of slander.
There is something else
I would like to tell you...
While we were waiting for you here,
our men searched your flat a little.
What right did you have to do that?
You should have had a search warrant,
signed by a public persecutor.
Who is your supervisor?
You assume I don't know the
legal procedure...
Tell me, do you always keep money
in dirty clothes basket?
Yes, of curse... always, always,
and marmalade,
as well as tooth-powder, in my sock,
and you not... Ha! Ha!
We've found this at your place
in the dirty clothes basket.
Empty it!
So the loss has been found...
My God!
You rebellious cad, you scoundrel,
you old son of a bitch.
You just wait! I'll get a hold of you.
Did you call me, sir?
It's absurd. What for
should I have robbed my own bank.
There are a few reasons. First, the
insurance, secondly,
the robbery affects more your customers
than you.
When they will come to draw out their
money, you'll spread your arms and say
"Where shall I take the money from? I've
been robbed."
I can believe you but the prosecutor
and the documents say differently.
It's absurd. I'm rich enough.
I don't want to rob myself.
There is a saying that the one who has
half a million is richer
than the one who has
a quarter of a million.
Maybe somebody has plotted it all
in order to crush me.
Does the name Kwinto convey
anything to you?
Yes, you gave him away collaborating
with us six years ago.
Do you think he might take his revenge?
Yes.
During my thirty year career
in the police I've never met a man
who would steal half a million
and then put it stealthily at the place
of somebody else in order to crush him...
Besides, I've checked up. Kwinto has an
alibi.
Alibi? Alibi, that's it. Why didn't you
ask me about my alibi?
Do you have alibi?
I do! I can prove it.
Turn the car around!
Good morning, is Miss Natalia in?
No one under this name lives here.
How so!
You are mistaken.
That's out of the question. I'm not
mistaken at all. I was here yesterday.
Who are you and what are you doing with
these legs?
Is it a bailiff?
No, some fool.
Police.
That man says he spent the evening
with a lady in this flat yesterday.
Will you let us in?
Well, I cannot hinder you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my! Incredible!
It's a horrible mystification.
In spite of all I recognize it.
This was the room.
I was here yesterday.
Interesting why we didn't meet
yesterday.
Maybe I was so absorbed in my work
that I haven't noticed you.
It's a thin disguise, officer.
You'd better arrest these people.
They are in collusion with the real
perpetrators. Put them under arrest.
Oh, no sooner did he come
than he wants to arrest.
Hush! It's a fool.
I was here yesterday, officer.
You have my word of honor for it.
Don't you believe me?
To tell you the truth,
you haven't convinced me.
Just a moment...
Now I remember. Just a moment...
a Negro... a Negro...
This is my alibi, officer.
Come on, let's go.
It will be the best alibi in the world. I
wouldn't like to be in your skin, officer.
What do you want?
Open the door.
What the deuce?
Is the man, in, the Negro?
What Negro?
The one who lives at your place.
God forbid! Under the same roof with an
antichrist.
Why you are lying? I saw a Negro with
a dog leaving your house yesterday.
With a dog?
Yes, with a dog!
Good Lord! What dog?
There aren't any dogs at all.
How so? No dogs? I've seen one...
Oh... and what...
... I saw him leaving your place.
This woman is in collusion
with them as well.
Put her under arrest, officer.
I beg you.
I swear I saw a dog and a Negro
going out of here yesterday, officer.
Upon my word. I beg you!
Mr. Kramer. That's enough. Let's go.
Ha! Ha! Your fiancée is first class...
no wonder Kramer fell in love with her.
I was simply his type.
Had I known you would get me into
trouble I would never agree do it.
I hope that he was even more successful
with tailor that with you.
Our scheme panned out well by a miracle.
Do you know what I have to do?
What?
Put an end to our decoy.
I have a very good idea. Do you know who
will be next?
There will be no next time.
How so? Are you a safe breaker or not?
You take me for somebody else, I'm a
musician.
Is a breaker a bad profession?
The same as other professions but also
requiring good qualifications.
Anyway, instead of stealing as a director,
manufacturer, secretary or president,
it's better to steal par excellence as a
thief. I think it's more honest.
Par excellence... it's a nicely said but
why have you robbed so many banks?
To be quite frank, the reason
was always the same.
What?
Because that's where the money is.
Officer, a few words
for the press, please.
Officer, a few words for...
Mr. Kramer, how did you strike upon
the idea of robbing your own bank?
Mr. Kramer, do you feel like
being Polish Al Capone...
