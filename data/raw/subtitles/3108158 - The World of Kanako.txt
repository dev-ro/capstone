I love you
I'll kill you

You bitch
Fucking kidding me!
You shit!
I'll kill you
(Eight months later)
Last night at 2AM 
Three were found dead in the supermarket of Northern Saitama 
The victims found dead were cashier, Hitoshi Kawamoto
Nearby worker, Ayaka Yasuda
And student at a pro photography school, Junpei Koyama
It is understood that the dead bodies had knife wounds ...
The first witness was an officer who received a report
The 3 had already been dead when found
Akikazu Fujishima
It's been 5 days and the police are still investigating
No clue for a suspect has been found
Omiya North Department, Ex-Police Lieutenant
Mr. Fujishima
Retired January of this year
You weren't fired, eh? 
Police is still keeping track of the case...
Now working as a security patrol
Do you have anything?
That you remember about the case? 
There's nothing 
I heard he lost everything... 
His house, daughter, even his ex-wife 
Maybe he was the one who caused this crazy murder...
(Schizophrenia/Manic Depression? ï¼‰
How are you doing?
You're taking your medication right?
One more can of beer!
Okay
Are you ill?
He lost his job and family at that age
This is the weapon that was used
Mr. Fujishima?
I did it
I killed the three people
You're thinking that, aren't you?
Ah, you reak!
Fucking shut up!
Who is he?
I said I don't fucking know him!
Were you with a stranger?
Show me your bag
Senpai!
Take a look at this
Have you seen these people?
All I saw were corpses
How is your family?
Your daughter is in high school now right?
None of your business
Don't fucking touch me
Let go of your hands!
Fucking shut up you shit!
(Omiya Supermarket, three murdered with knives still stabbed)
(A father's nightmare of seeing his daughter suffer! )
(The madness that stole a young man's dreams)
Do you sleep well at night?
Do you dream?
Thank god you picked up
Sorry to bother you ... were you asleep?
But I have something urgent to ask you
It's about Kanako ...
I thought maybe she was over at your place
Please, do not hide her
Why would Kanako be here
She disappeared and hasn't come home for several days
And I can't contact her at all
So um...
Please tell the truth ... Are you ...
You think I kidnapped Kanako?
No, that's not what I mean
Fucking bullshit!
Kanako is...
You piece of shit!
(Kiriko)
Do you not dream at all?

Come in
Can I?
Have you called the police?
I can't do that yet
Go to Kanako's room
Go! You would know what's going on!
It might be my misjudgment anyways
School bag!
Huh?
What about the bag?
There's nothing
That's ...
Ey!
How long has she been gone?
Five or six days
You know any of her friend's contacts?
No
What is this?
Neurology?
What. She told me she was going to the dentist
Did she have a part-time job?
There were expensive clothes in her closet
No...I don't think
Who is this? Her boyfriend?
I don't know at all
You don't know anything, do you!
You say so proudly!
You don't even remember what she looks like now!
Was she thin?
Eh?
Did you check her appetite and eyes?
Drug addicts will usually thin
How dare you think she would do such a thing!
She is our daughter!
"Our"? 
Hey ...
What should I do?
I'll find her
I'll call the police
What would happen if she goes to the police!
Someone like you can't...
Calm down
Stupid!
You're making fun of me now, aren't you!
You think this is none of your business anymore!
Don't touch me!
(Three years ago)
Why can't people live in the water?
It's so peaceful here...
But over here is hell
Why am I a human?
These hands and feet
Eyes, mouth, and ears
My hair
My nose that's taller than others
I don't want any of this at all
The kiss Hiromi-kun gave me changed my world...
Ahh! So cute!
If I'm only gonna get hurt, I don't want my heart
I'm definitely...
Not fit to be a human
Probably him as well...
Damn it...
Damn it!
Were you crying?
Fujishima...
No...
It was pretty obvious
Kanako Fujishima
The one and only beautiful creature on Earth
What's wrong with your face?
What?
Hey, look at that 
Here you go 
My eyes, mouth, ears, and nose
All exist in order to feel you
My hands...:-no
Exist in order to connect with you-no
And my feet...
Kanako!
See you!
Exist in order to chase you
The reason why I'm still willing to be human
Is probably because you're in this world
Isn't it?
Fujishima
I already told everything we know to the mother
Then tell me it in detail one more time
I said, we were aiming to go to a private university
Kanako wanted to go to a national university
So we only had morning classes together
What happened after that?
I called her in the evening but she doesn't pick up
Do you have any idea where she would've gone?
Like some man's place?
Is it this guy?
Who is this? Do you know him?
She can't be contacted for several days now
Wouldn't you take this seriously since you are friends?...
Friends?
Were we friends?
Isn't this fairly normal?
We don't constantly contact our parents 
She's different from you guys
Who is?
Um, do you really know Kanako?
Did she work?
I don't know
Can we go now?
You easily get thirsty when you're addicted to drugs, right?
What is this?
You would know, wouldn't you?
What do you want!
Don't bark at me
I just want to find my daughter
If you tell me everything you know, you can take this
Something's wrong with you
You guys don't look like proper high school students
We have nothing more to talk about
Let go! You're such a nuisance!
(Tsujimura Neurology Clinic)
I prescribed anti-anxiety and light sleeping pills
Your daughter has no big issue
She is intelligent
No smoking please
But she wouldn't come without an issue
We're in a hurry to investigate here
What were the symptoms she was having?
Can't sleep, gets irritated
Becomes drenched in sweat
Subconsciously reaches for a cigar, things like that
Would you like me to prescribe you a medication?
No, I'm alright
Did she have anything she was worried about?
Apparently there were some family problems
You do know about her parents' divorce, right?
Give me her medical history form please
I remember her father's occupation was also...
You have her medical records, don't you?
I'm sorry
We cannot disclose a patient's privacy
Not even the police
That piece of shitty doctor! 
I have my own medicine!
What!
What's the matter?
I was able to contact Kanako's friends from middle school
Wow! I was fat!
It's been so long!
About Kanako...
Were you guys together elementary to middle school?
Ah, yeah
What kind of person was she?
Personality? Super good!
She was serious and clever
I heard this man switched jobs again!
What!
Do you know him?
Who is this?
Oh, he committed suicide when we were in 8th grade...
Suicide?
Ogata!
Yeah, him!
Were they dating?
No way!
It's Ogata! He was lame and bullied all the time
Who would want to associate with him!
Oh yeah, but at his funeral...
Long time no see!
I'm going to order pizza
They also were Kanako's friends
Really? We can eat for free? 
Ayy
Did Kanako and Ogata get along well? 
Kanako got along with everyone
She has a great personality
Ogata must've taken it the wrong way
He thought that Kanako was his only one
That's so true! There were so many boys that misunderstood her
Ey, it wasn't just boys
Remember that ugly...
Nami Endo!
She was a drug dealer, right?
Yeah
Which one's the drug dealer?
This one! Nami Endo 
What about him?
Matsunaga!
He's scary!
He's super crazy now
Ahh, I suddenly really wanna go karaoke-ing
Karaoke okay? 
Wait until we finish eating!
I wonder what kind of person that girl was
Don't think about it, just eat
It must just be a prank
She wants us to worry about her
It's because we left her alone all the time!
That's why...
(Three years ago)
Why can't people fly? 
Stop squirming!
Yet why did he fly anyway? 
Where has myself of that day gone? 
Playing tug-a-war with these idiots for this tiny place on Earth 
Die!
Hey just let him go 
What's wrong?
You asshole!
Stay quiet, you piece of shit
You saved me again
No
I just wanted it to be quiet
Because this is his and my special place
Him...
Ogata
Wanna drink?
Here is where I first met him 
Is this Sake?!
I was alone, and he was alone 
He looked at me and said
"You want to disappear too, right?"
Wanting to disappear...
Isn't it unfair?
Leaving me here 
Doing this on his own
Fujishima!
What?
Like Ogata...
You thought I was going to jump off like him? 
Not that...
You fool
Can I become like Ogata?
What are you talking about?
Huh?
I don't get it
Ow!
That's hilarious
You really are weird
Fuck
This is embarassing but...
I've been immersed in work
Completely unaware of my daughter
So you come to her old teacher to ask questions?
Yes, it's too late, but ...
But...?
Nothing
I understand how you feel
I also have a young daughter
I sometimes don't know what she was thinking
Is Miss Kanako doing well?
Yes...
She, back then,
Seemed to be repeatedly attempting suicide
As if...
What?
Ogata's death was her responsibility
She took it all into her own hands
Specific details?
Long-term absenteeism, looking pale,
Losing weight...
Drug use
Uh, was it drugs?
And these kids ...
She hung around them?
Kanako!
I'm sorry that I did not report to you
But...
I could not believe it back then
Where are they now?
Nami Endo passed away last year
She just couldn't stop her drug habits
Of course
Those piece of shits deserve to die
It all makes sense now
These shits passed around drugs to her
The school knew, but didn't call action 
That is not true
What is not true!
Try making excuses
Hey Senpai, were you able to remember anything?
That picture you showed me last time...
That paled face with piercings
Ohh, yes yes
Which one is he?
Well let's look at here
It was a gang that Koyama(murdered at the supermarket)
had connections with 
Speak in detail. What's his name?
The one with piercings 
Name?
It's Yasuhiro Matsunaga 
So it was that Matsunaga, 
Who passed drugs to Kanako 
That piece of shit 
It's hot!
He sold drugs under a gang called Nishimaru  
Really
He was the one who absorbed kanako
It's all his fault
I even know his home address
Everything is okay 
We'll find Kanako right after we catch this guy 
Are you happy?
What?
Because you found out Kanako was a drug addict
Don't say anything stupid!
Your face is full of smiles
Are you crazy?
I'll find Kanako, so...
What are you talking about! What are you doing?
Our daughter is missing, how dare you!
I want to start over 
Get out!
Can you find Kanako all by yourself?! 
If I don't let you touch me, you're not gonna find her? 
You have the nerves to say that!
Shut up
You really don't give a damn about Kanako...
You don't care about Kanako either
Let go of me!
Fuck off!
Stop it!
Don't!
That's why you were with that kind of guy!
Leaving your daughter by herself
Making love with that baldie!
Stop it!
Go die
Fucking kidding me!
I love you
Don't!
Cook breakfast
I'm staying here
Then I'm moving out
This is my home
I will protect you and kanako
You really have the face to say this shit!
Because I love you
What kind of joke is that? 
Something's wrong with your brain!
Shut up and cook breakfast!
Kanako is...
Leave her alone
She forgot about you a long time ago
Fuck
Then I'll make her remember
She is my daughter!
What's wrong with that?
Get out you psycho!
I'll kill you, you piece of shit!
What's wrong with me loving my family? 
One morning, when I opened my eyes
My world had changed
As if it was magic 
(Three years ago)
Are you okay?
Your method is dirty
I'm not afraid of that guy
That guy?
Don't play dumb, I'm talking about Matsunaga!
He and his crew...
It was you, wasn't it!
I have nothing to do with it
I've never even spoken with Matsunaga
You quit baseball
To hang out with those kinds of people?
What? No
Then what is it
Why did you quit on your own!
Because I realized
I am not meant to chase baseballs 
My position is not the eighth, right field
There is no reason
What did you say!
Teacher, Shimazu hit him!
Shimazu hit him!
Teacher!
Matsunaga says hello 
My world changed as if it was by magic
And the magic must've been casted by...
(Alice in Wonderland)
Don't play dumb with me, you old bitch!
Yasuhiro Matsunaga is your son!
That shit is not my son
Who are you?
I am the police of Omiya Police Department!
Where is he?
God knows
Don't fuck around with me
Do you understand what your son has done!
That has nothing to do with me!
You're the fucking parent!
I don't care about that piece of shit
That's right, your son is garbage
Because you are garbage!
Parents must take the responsibility!
Take responsibility and kill him!
What are you!
Hey!
Ay, who are you?
It reaks of old man in here
Senpai!
Are you alright?
Is your brain broken?
Fujishima: Shut up!
Asai: Ooh, scary
What are these people?
Why are you here?
I was taking a stroll
Did something happen to your daughter?
Miss Kanako, correct?
She had connections with Matsunaga, right?
You answer my question!
Okay, okay. The truth is, Matsunaga is chased by
His own gang and the Ishimaru group 
You just happened to unfortunately be involved in the fight
What did he do?
Who knows what stupid kids would do?
But Junpei Koyama, who was murdered, 
Is Matsunaga's Senpai
And he was an ex-member of Matsunaga's gang
Matsunaga is related to that case?
They are connected...maybe
Which one hit you? 
You've been going through rough times, Senpai
Your wife just left your apartment
That's sad because you just came back 
Are you following me?
Well, yes
After all, you are a vital witness for the supermarket murder 
Kiriko! What are you up to!
I was about to ask the same thing
Father-in-Law...
Where is Kanako? Where did you hide her? 
Hide? What are you talking about?
Don't play dumb with me
I heard from Kiriko
I know you are hiding her
Stop talking nonsense, why would I hide her
You are misunderstanding
Please put me on the phone with Kiriko
You really have the face to say this now
After kidnapping Kanako
You think everything would still be fine?
You're very irrational...
I said put her on the phone! I want to talk to her!
Give back Kanako
Give back?!
She's my daughter
Kiriko and my daughter!
Kiriko and kanako have nothing to do with you anymore
You forcefully sent a lawyer and disbanded our family!
I will report to the police
I dare you
It's you who's gonna be humiliated!
Where is she?
I said we don't know where Kanako is
No, I am asking you where that scrawny friend of yours is! 
Who?
Nagano?
I don't understand what you're saying
Don't play dumb you ugly bitch! 
Hey!
Listen to me. I don't give a shit what happens to you
But my daughter...
Let go of me, shut up!
Only Kanako...!
Kanako is...
Your daughter! She sold drugs to Nagano
Scammed her, threatened her, even got her into prostitution 
It's all because of Kanako!
Don't act so fucking high and mighty when you don't know anything!
I need to find her
I want her to...
None of my business!
She should just die!
(Three years ago)
Looking for me?
No
I want to thank you for changing my situation
It's you who's telling Matsunaga to...right?
Yeah
Do you want to come to my house?
It's okay, no one's home
Where are your parents?
My dad is running away
My mom is having an affair
I'm lonely and I'm...falling 
What does that mean?
The hole she fell into was too deep
She keeps falling and falling
It's a tale of a girl like that
(Alice in Wonderland)
Did the whole Matsunaga incident cause you trouble?
No, I'm just a little surprised
Didn't think you'd know Matsunaga
I just assumed you weren't a part of those kinds of people
Do you want to meet Matsunaga?
There's a party tomorrow
But I don't know him that well...
Me neither
We just occasionally hang out
When I'm alone too much
I feel crazy
When I'm alone...
You want to disappear?
You speak like Ogata
Maybe you two are similar?
You said you wanted to become like Ogata, right?
Then I want you to get to know me better
I sure would like to
Endlessly get to know you
I think I'll go...to the party
Fujishima
Ew!
You guys drinking?
We don't wanna hear that from crap like you
I'm a cop. Are you guys minors? 
What are you doing out so late?
Let go of me
Have you ever thought of how much parents worry?
Okay, I get it!
No you don't!
As parents...
How much I worry about...
Where am I even at?
Damn it!
Kanako!
Who is that?
Hey, you're gonna have to pay me-
What's going on?!
Ow!
Where are the things your daughter hid?
Stop it
They're in her bag
We're not looking for drugs
Then what is it? What are you people!
It seems you don't know how much trouble your daughter has caused
Who knows what that little bitch would do!
Yes, your daughter is shit
Proves how she's related to garbage like you
Garbage...
Stop it!
Spread their stench around them
Garbage...destroys innocence
and purity!
So...I'll kill you
I'll let you taste the death of loved onese before
Then you're next
I have nothing to do with this!
I don't even remember her face 
Then smell this and remember
The garbage odor 
that you gave birth to
Hey
Go away. You said you don't want anything to do with this
Yeah, but Nagano insisted in giving you this
This is the key to the locker 
next to the North exit of the train station
Accept it!
Who cares for you, bitch
Go die
You have the responsibility as the parent!
What did you say?
This is the key that Kanako entrusted to Nagano
Matsunaga
I really don't know anything!
Then fuck off!
Nagano...
None of my business!
I have nothing to do with your drug addict friend
Don't touch me
Nagano has been terrified...
She said she's fearing...in danger...
Tell me in detail!
I can't!
She refuses to explain anything!
I told her to go to the police if she's in that much danger
Since when has she been afraid?
Since...
Him...
After he was killed
Constantly after she saw the news 
She says she might be killed too
Who killed him?
How should I know!
But...
I guess it's...
Kanako
Nagano has always adored kanako
She is the goddess of her ideals
She did whatever Kanako told her to do
She was even forced into prostitution
Even so, she still liked her
Kanako is really beautiful
But...
She is a hopeless lunatic
Let me meet Nagano right now
Nagano said she doesn't want to see you
I don't give a damn about your situation!
But...
You want to save her right?
Nagano
Can this car even be driven on?
I love you
Follow me
Don't come
Alice
Senpai
You leave a girl on her own and run away
You're so heartless
Can I speak with you?
I would love to meet and chat
Shut up! You wanna die?!
Piece of shit
Fujishima
Where are you taking me?
This guy is...
Fuck
Damn
Fuck!
You want to become like Ogata, right? 
All this...
Seems to occur in a different world
My mother's voice
Is as if it's in another language
I just can't understand
Shut up!
Is this also magic?
That you...
Casted on me...
Fujishima
Senpai, you told me to meet you and you bail?
Under the table
The man with glasses, wearing a sailor suit
It's Misawa from the Officer Department, yeah?
Ah, close. It's Officer Miura
Where did you get such things?
Did he cause this?
What does that mean?
They were in Nagano's phone memory
You can't just take evidence from our department
The last call Nagano made was the Omiya North Police Department
What?!
Don't play dumb!
She called the police, yet she was killed. Why is that?
We're still investigating, we can't tell you
Just admit it. It was the police who killed her
Who was it? Was it you?
Might be you
What are you shits planning to do
Nothing
We just want to quietly solve this case
Where is Kanako?!
Do you really not know?
How about we cooperate then
Who wants to collaborate with you!
Can you give me those photos?
Shut up!
Stay quiet if you want them, you piece of shits!
You stay quiet too, you old man
Please. Hand us the photos
Would you kneel down and lick my ass?
We have our own rules 
We also have the power to protect them
Senpai, you should know now
There's nothing you can do alone after quitting your job
Fujishima
Because of the magic you casted,
I begin to lose myself
Do you like kids with runny noses? 
Is dressing up girls in doll clothes 
and making love with them
A hobby of yours?
What are you?
What are YOU?!
Fujishima
Fujishima
Kanako
Fujishima
Hey, did you realize how stupid you are? 
If you dare to tell others, we're definitely killing you
We'll hand these out too! 
To home, school, and the Internet
Fujishima
Kanako was laughing
She said you came running to her with a wagging tail
just because she pet you
Did you fall in love with her?
How many times did you masturbate while thinking about her?
Stop!
Tell me!
She seduced me
Your daughter!
Doctor
You like young girls, right?
Eh?
I understand. I understand everything about you 
I certainly did not go along with her
But a few days later
A man called me
Who?
A businessman named Cho
Is it him?
Answer me!
Yes
Tell me everything about Kanako
What has she done!
What has she said!
What the hell is she!
She is your daughter
Kanako told me 
She said to keep your body clean 
So you'll be ready to be called in! 
You hear that, Alice
This is your new name!
The hole you fell into is so deep 
That you keep falling and falling
It's a story of that kind of girl
The police called me. Kanako's friend was killed
They asked me questions 
But I don't know anything
What is going on?
Hey. Where is Kanako?
Kanako is...
Your daughter...
I understand. 
I understand everything about you.
Same with him
The same as how he...
You...
I?
Did to me
You want to as well, right Doctor? 
Bullshit!
I'm not lying
Your daughter said so
Your daughter said so
She was...
Abused by you
What a joke!
Bitch! I'll kill you!
What is it?
I...
What's the matter? Hey, What happened?
I...
What do you want to do?
Dad
Bitch!
Do you want to die?
She came close to being killed by her beloved father
That's not true!
Why...
You love me
She is my daughter!
So what?
Because you love me?
I...
Is that why you do this to me?
I...
I understand everything about you Dad
I love you
Bitch
Motherfucker!
Die! Die!
Is she still alive?
Kanako
Where is she? Tell me!
Where is she now?
Shut up! You shit!
Shut up! Disappear!
Go die!
Kanako is very scary
She lures people in by telling them what they want to hear
I love you
And then ruins them
What are you laughing at, you bitch!
Fujishima
Because of the magic you casted...
I gradually lose myself
Where is Kanako?
Where are you?
Do you understand where you are?
Shitty gangsters
Does it hurt?
This is the punishment for what your daughter has caused
What has she done?
There was a man named Cho
Your daughter was his favorite, but...
She took the liberty of spreading secret erotic photos
And sent them all to perverted old men customers
This is not a joke, Dad
Your daughter is too liberal
See ya!
See ya!
Good night
I keep falling down this deep hole
But it's as if...
I'm not afraid
Because I feel close to you...
Fujishima
All of you are scum
We are scum yes, but we abide by the rules
Rules that provide happiness for all
Rules?
Your daughter broke them
So...
I'll kill
The criminal is Matsunaga
That kid plotted everything
Kanako was used by him
It doesn't seem so
I adored and cared for him
But he fell in love with your daughter and betrayed me
Idiot
It's Kanako Fujishima's father
Say hello
Matsunaga ...
You're done for
In fact...
This is the beginning
Where?
Where do you want to be cut first?
How about here?
Fujishima? Where is she?
You are crazy
She's at a hotel
The one at the North exit, Eden Hotel
It was the same for Ogata too, right?
Ogata, who died, was just like me
We killed Ogata
Because he was so small and cute
We repeatedly brought him to old men
So he committed suicide
Kanako became close to us to avenge his death
I knew all along
Fujishima loved Ogata...right?
I can't understand Kanako's feelings
Kanako is...
I love you
She was so gentle
And cruel
She ruins them
As long as I can be with her
I would do anything
Even if you would get killed?
I wouldn't be afraid
She is so crazy and so empty ...
Everyone's lives are ruined because of her
But why...
Why does everyone become obsessed with her?
Kanako is...
She is the ...
Demon
Dad
Guess how many times I've done it with her
Don't be carried away by him, Dad!
This kid wants to die already
He wants to be killed and feel at ease
You're going to go see kanako?
Yeah
Do you love her?
Yeah
You're gonna get killed
Then...
I'll leave a mark
This is the proof that I've lived
Please. I'll give you the photos and anything
So let Kanako...
I would do anything
Do you adore your daughter, even if she's a lunatic?
What a joke! That little bitch!
Then why?
I have no clue
I want to once again personally with my own hands...
Embrace her?
Beat her!
That bitch, how dare she look down on me!
I'm going to beat her
With my own hands!
That little bitch...
I'll kill her
I love you
This is the "dog" Cho raises
Can you kill him?
He's a police officer but became Cho's follower
A cop?
Yeah, and still am 
Cho was cornered so he made him kill many
He made him kill too many
The supermarket, Internet cafe
Perhaps even your daughter
He's a crazy dog
A psycho
But Cho gives him so much money
His wife and children get to live in luxury
She's a great woman, eh?
He has everything
That you've lost
Do you envy him?
Dad
Who would want to...
Do you dream?
You are not dreaming?
Dream?
Yes
Of course I dream
What kind?
I have a beautiful wife and daughter
Both of them...
Love me
The happiness...
With my own hands...
I destroy it!
That's the kind of dream
Let go of me!
Bitch
Don't!
Bitch
Die
Die!
Bitch
Lord, please forgive us our sins
As we forgive others
Lead us from temptation
Give us salvation...
(Husband)
I ruined your most important thing for you!
You are scum!
Where is Kanako? Did you kill her?!
I haven't killed her yet.
Of course you haven't. 
If you killed her, I would've killed your family as well
Don't touch them
I'll give your daughter back. It's an exchange
How dare you command me!
You shitty serial killer!
Serial killer?
Taking a drive with your family?
Lucky
Where are you going?
Don't play dumb. You police-men are connected with
gangs, aren't you?
What? Oh, please
What rules! You piece of shits!
That guy
You talked with that guy about me, right?
Can you forgive me?
I...
Be thankful, you old man!
You are crazy
You even killed your own master
He commanded me to stop killing 
He won't shut up so I made him be quiet!
Dad!
I'll kill by my own will from now on
With my own rules
Where's Kanako?
You'll meet her in hell
Ah, fuck
Dad!
Why don't you shoot that kid as well?
I bet you can't wait to kill him
Whether it's me or your son
As long as you can kill someone, you don't care
You pervert!
Shut up!
You are the garbage!
I'm going to kill you
You and your daughter
Is Kanako still alive?
I'm going to kill!
She is still alive
Dad!
Drop the gun!
Go get him
Suicide
Old man
She's not dead
She's still alive
Perhaps the hole is too deep
Alice falls slowly
(Alice in Wonderland)
She looks around while falling all around
Lots of time for her to think what would happen next
Suddenly slams onto the end of the fall
The fall has finally been completed
Only with a small scratch, Alice stood up
Looking up at the dark ceiling,
Watching a running rabbit, late for his time
I wonder if there's an end?
Every one of the castle doors were locked
(Eden Hotel, Room 818)
Alice was disappointed
How in the world
Will she be able to escape this place?
I was waiting for you
I knew you'd come
Did you trick me?
Are you crying?
Shut up!
It's pretty obvious...
Answer me!
Why did you lie to me?
Because you...
Always were watching me
Fujishima
I was happy
Really happy
Kanako Fujishima
But I'm sorry
That's not me
What?
That's not me, it's the other girl
But...
I've been in here all along
In here...
Alone
I was dreaming the whole time
What kind of joke is this?
I don't understand!
What dream?
Was it to come close to me, lie to me...
Turn me into a mess?
That's right, a mess
There are no rules because it's a dream
Everything is free
You can love anyone
You can do anything to the one you love
Kiss him
Kill him
What do you want to do?
Dad
Occasionally there are lost people who come into my dreams
But they suddenly escape
Because freedom is scary
Fujishima
This is hilarious
Kanako FUjishima
The one and only beautiful creature on Earth
I'm going to kill you
What are you laughing at?
Is it me?
Am I that funny?
Then kill me now!
Kill me now
And then laugh!
You shit
I love you
Scared?
I'm scared
Very scared
It's okay
Did you love Ogata?
Yes, very
So I killed him
Because I wanted to love him more and more
Fujishima...
Kanako Fujishima
I love you
Who...
Are you?
(Akiko, I'm picking up the cake)
(I'll be back soon so wait for me!-Mom)
Teacher, do you remember me?
I am the father of Kanako Fujishima
What do you want
I've been searching for my daughter since then
I've found a little bit more about her
Why are you here?
My daughter was a scum
Proves that she is definitely my daughter
Couldn't separate from the gangs and drugs
And in high school, she began selling drugs
Also forced students to sell their bodies...
I know of none
How could you not know
Miss Fujishima
Teacher!
The customers were successful but sexually perverted businessmen
Kanako even lured people younger than her
Is Akiko doing well?
Yes, well I just wanted to ask you something 
What's the matter?
She suddenly had her own cell phone
I asked her and she told me you gave it to her
Is that true?
Sorry I did not inform you, Teacher.
It's true
She helped me out a little. It was a return
Look at it
I've seen this photo of crap a hundred times
And I finally understood
What is this?
The girl in the photo is your daughter
I'm not forcing her into prostitution
I casually invited her and she was all for it
What are you talking about
I don't understand!
How could you do this to her...
It's because she's so cute, of course
I will never forgive...
Who?
Kanako?
Or your daughter?
Don't joke around! It was your daughter who invited her!
This is what Akiko decided to do with her own will
She doesn't know any better
She doesn't understand...what you made her go into
God knows
How old do you think she is!
Akiko is still...
But that's what's popular among middle-aged men!
She is a real devil
Devil?
So what did you do to the devil?
Say it
What did you do to her!
Give her back
Give her back?
Give me back my pure Akiko!
Her purity? Oh, please
You underestimate her, Teacher
Nonsense!
What do you know about her...
Then do you understand her?
Are you looking at her properly?
Watching her, touching her
Do you know where her bulges and holes are on her body?
What are you saying?
Akiko told me "Mom won't try to understand me at all"
You don't understand...her feelings
She felt very lonely
Where is she?
Where did you put my daughter?
Is this how you killed her?
Yes
Why?
I don't know
Because I love Akiko
My daughter
You don't understand
These kinds of human emotions
You...Love her?
There's no way you would know!
Here and here!
All empty!
I love you
Hilarious
Teacher
That's so funny
You shit
Find her already
You buried her, so dig her up
That's not possible
I don't care how many years it'll take
As long as you don't find Kanako
You can't see your daughter
You are crazy
You and your daughter are both crazy
Of course. We're blood related
Find her quickly!
Take me back
Let me see Akiko
No
Then kill me!
You're too naive
Know that as long as you don't find Kanako, 
this hell will continue
I don't know anything about her
Nothing at all
My memories of her are only of...
When I attempted to strangle her
With these hands
Birthday
Today is her birthday
She's 18
Find her quickly
Where the hell is she!
I don't know!
It's too late
She is still alive
As long as I live
She won't die
She...is me
I will...
With my own hands
Personally...
And ruthlessly
Kill her!
