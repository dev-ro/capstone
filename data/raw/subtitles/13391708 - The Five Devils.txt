Five, six, seven, eight...
Heels buttocks.
Arms underwater. Very well.
Heels buttocks.
And...
... heels buttocks.
Very good, Lulu.
Don't slack off. Legs straight. Very well.
Come on, girls. scream.
See you next week, girls.
Thank you, you were great.
See you next week, Lulu.
That went much better. Bye.
Bye, girls. Stay safe.
Bye.
Mom, can I get the noodles?
-Sure
Don't run.
-Let's go.
Wait a second. See you tomorrow, Nadine.
-Bye.
Joanne, are you coming to cocktail night?
Emilie and Morgane are also there.
Jimmy can come too if he wants.
I don't know yet. I'll call you.
-Please.
You never go. You're becoming boring.
-I call you.
Take it easy.
Seven degrees.
-Twenty minutes then.
Finished?
-I love you mom.
And I love you.
I love you the most.
MOM 3
She clamped me down.
10 YEARS OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS
CHESTNUT
PINE CONE
MOM 1
MOM 2
The slopes are not yet flooded
by skiers.
For now, the walkers are
still in the majority.
Vicky, come say goodbye to your father.
Goodbye.
Why are you smelling that?
-I'm sorting them.
You sort them? By scent?
What do you smell?
Not so much.
-Close your eyes.
It smells like mould
and it also smells like...
...mushroom.
And you can smell the animal that ate from it.
A rat or a squirrel, I don't know.
You recognize the breath
of a rat or a squirrel?
Yes.
Close your eyes.
What do you smell?
-Cookies.
That was a breeze.
Keep your eyes closed.
And this?
Plastic that smells a bit like earth.
And this?
A book that smells like the swimming pool.
And a little bit of coffee.
Do you smell me too?
Sure.
Wait.
Eyes closed.
You don't see anything?
Do you smell me now?
-At two meters.
Now you count to twenty
and you're going to look for me.
One two Three...
...four five six...
...16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
Mom?
-Yes?
I found you.
I'll be right back.
That is Toilet brush's mother.
-Hey, Cobweb Duster.
Are you afraid?
You're stupid and a weird troll,
Toilet brush, Cobweb duster.
There you have her mother. Get out.
Why did you lock them?
Is everything alright?
The Languedoc Prize,
important for the pool...
One drop.
- Dad, stop. She's eight.
Sure. Tell.
Honey? Can you go play there?
What's the problem?
Your flame sprinkler?
Dad...
What then?
-Vicky.
What is it?
She has a very weird sense of smell.
Your daughter lives in her own world.
She's not sick.
What does Jimmy say?
-She would put her in therapy right away.
I don't want that.
How's Jimmy?
What does that mean?
Do you fuck?
-Dad...
Still not?
-I'm not discussing this with you.
With whom else? Your girl friends?
You don't have any.
The only one you have is so retarded
as what. That's no use to you.
There you have it too. Listen.
Every evening around the same time
he is at the door.
And every night I feed him tuna.
Delicious, canned tuna. He loves that.
I also gave him roast beef once.
He didn't want any of it. But this...
I know there are people who’re
starving, but I just like it.
Are you pouring something?
-Of course.
But what am I supposed to do?
Buy a nice set, something seductive.
Something that shows your body,
instead of a hobo bag.
You leave the little one with me and you have
a nice evening together with your husband.
Under each other or on top of each other.
Eat, Vicky.
I don't like canned green beans.
I hate that smell.
Should I have picked them in the garden?
Everything okay?
Empty your plate.
Okay.
Of course.
Rue des Lilas 14.
See you tomorrow.
Who was that?
Julia.
You are kidding, right?
Why 'see you tomorrow'?
Why? I really can't do that.
Why do you think that?
I don't want it.
This is the guest room,
but we don't often have guests.
They belong to Vicky, do you mind?
-Of course not.
What happened?
-I was drunk and I fell.
It's nothing serious.
Vicky, help me.
Sorry, she would clean up.
Do you need anything else?
-Can I take a shower?
Of course.
-Can I borrow some of Joanne's clothes?
I'll ask her.
Thank you for the ticket.
That really touched me.
I'm glad you called.
I'll get you clothes.
She smells like alcohol.
Peated whisky.
-What do you know about Peated whisky?
Is she your little sister or your big sister?
- My little sister.
Why doesn't she have an accent?
-She was born in France, just like you.
I was already older when I came from Senegal.
But we partly grew up here together.
Why didn't I know her yet?
-We lost track of each other.
That sometimes happens when you grow up.
How long haven't you seen her?
Ten years.
A conference about what?
-Nanotechnology.
What is that?
It's me.
And what is your field?
-Bio-nanotechnology.
I deal with neurons.
Piece of pie?
No idea what happened to my
meringue, but it's different than usual.
Very tasty.
-Really?
MERRY CHRISTMAS GREETINGS
FROM THE SOLER FAMILY
I hope you're well.
Let's call soon. Love, Jimmy.
Is everything alright?
I want her to go. I can't take this.
Girls, wait.
-Hurry up, Nadine. It's cold.
Hi girls. Just together.
This is... Come here, Julia.
This is Julia Soler, she's 17.
She is from Paris.
She placed second individually.
Applause, good job.
Make her feel at home on the team.
It's important.
Especially with the Christmas gala coming up.
It's no contest,
but it is for the public.
Joanne, are you taking off those dangles?
These?
-Your creoles.
Do not gym with them.
-I like them.
You take them off.
-They look good on me.
You take them off. OK, let's start.
Oh dear.
Didn't forget anything?
Buckle up.
Come quickly, Vicky.
-Kiss, honey.
It is my fault. Sorry.
I'll show you.
Look.
Don't laugh, huh?
OK, there it goes.
One two Three.
Nice.
Fun?
-Yes.
Thank you.
Your sister said you're in the fire department?
How beautiful.
Got it from your girlfriend?
-Nadine, do you have cigarettes?
And thanks.
-Sorry.
I do have a lighter.
So, you thought we were crap?
-It wasn't great.
You mean bad?
-It was a bit of a flop.
I am very good at massaging.
-Go ahead.
Julia, what's wrong?
Julia, calm down.
What did you do to her?
-Nothing. I massaged her, that's all.
It's happening again, Jimmy.
-I am with you. There's no one, just us.
Psycho.
Goddamn.
Is she with you?
Who?
-Julia.
No.
You don't do that to me, right?
-No.
That's my father.
She's been coming to the pub for two evenings.
Who says that?
-Everyone knows that.
Not me.
And Jimmy knows nothing?
-No.
Did you know that the total mass
of ants on earth...
...is larger...
...than the total mass
of people on earth?
I did not know that.
-I saw that the other day.
A documentary. I didn't know what I saw.
I'm telling you this because you're my buddy
but I heard some things.
You know what the people are like here.
Some things make them really
not happy. And then they can go far.
Why 'far'? Threatening?
No, but you know how it is.
People talk.
They talk. What is your sister doing here?
My sister has been tried; she has been treated
and things are better now.
They don't care.
If they want to say something
they can come to me.
GREEN SOAP
Toilet brush.
-Cobweb duster.
Let me go.
-What is that?
Mould.
-Where did you get that again?
No, not my jars.
-How gross.
An egg from the cafeteria?
That gives me an idea.
She can eat it.
-Pinch her nose.
You're stupid and a weird troll,
Toilet brush, Cobweb duster.
Green soap? We're going to rinse her mouth.
Open.
Vicky, did you play with a scarf?
Did you strangle them?
Answer.
What kind of game did you play?
What happened?
Is everything alright? What's going on?
Grab your bag.
-Mrs. Soler, we were waiting for you.
We found these children unconscious
and we want to know what happened.
It was Toilet brush.
-Cobweb duster.
Hey, watch your mouth.
Just tell the principal.
Who did this?
Vicky, did you hurt Lilou?
- Hey, watch your mouth.
Let her answer.
-No. What do you mean 'Toilet brush, Cobweb duster'?
I'm asking your daughter something.
Can't she answer?
-No, I'm here.
I'm asking something. They were unconscious.
I want to know why.
Me too.
- She can talk, right?
Me too.
-I'm asking her something.
That can also be done differently.
Of course, just walk away. she will
be coming before the juvenile judge, that girl.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
Bitch.
Bitch.
- What did she say there?
Bitch.
-You are insane.
I didn't strangle them.
I hope so.
That is also possible.
Why 'Toilet brush'?
Do they often call you that?
You must tell me, Vicky.
Otherwise, I can't help you.
Grandpa.
-Tell them I'm not here.
Give me your mother.
-She's not here.
Does your car drive itself then?
Give her a minute or I’ll cut off your ears.
Here, mom. Grandpa.
Yes?
-Come here tonight. We have to talk.
Another time this week. Can't tonight.
- Honey, I'm worried about you.
Is that lesbian pyromaniac with you?
From Sunday morning
thunderstorms towards the Provence.
Vicky, come and help.
-I'm busy.
PYROMANIAC
Someone who has an irrepressible urge
to arson.
Can I do something?
-No thanks. I'll be fine.
I bought a good wine.
Would you like a glass?
We don't drink that much.
If you want me to go, I'll go.
Do you do the octopus?
What do I do with it?
-Well...
Grab it like this...
...and then hit.
ok, may I?
Now he is tender.
-And now?
Don't tell anyone and keep going.
Wait. like so, yes.
Let's see, what now.
Step two.
-'Beat the octopus tender'.
He's tender.
-'Remove intestines, beak, eyes.'
It's okay, right?
-'Scare the octopus.'
What?
-What is that?
Dip three times in boiling water
until the tentacles curl up.”
The water is boiling.
Don't destroy my kitchen.
Are you alright? Or am I interrupting?
-We're working.
Joanne, get dressed.
-I'm dressed.
Now.
Have you known each other for a long time?
-Since September.
My daughter is always thrilled
when she has something new.
Until she gets bored.
Just know that.
She also said...
...that you have some mental problems
had?
Is this Okay?
What are you doing?
-I have to leave.
Why?
-Otherwise, I'll miss the last bus.
Wait.
I’ve gotta get out of here.
-Why?
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.
-That's not true.
You think so too.
-What? That's not true at all.
I'm not crazy. I can see it.
Then what do you see?
- You don't understand.
If you don't try,
you don't know.
I see a little girl.
And she scares you?
Yes.
If you're scared,
Shall we leave together then?
I have thought about it. We can go
to Marseilles. To my friend Fanny.
Stop that nonsense.
-No nonsense. I've got it all figured out.
Let's leave after the Christmas gala.
And then you run away from your father?
-Yes.
I'm not staying here all my life.
I don't want to think about it.
But Marseille, you like that?
For real?
Wait. come.
What? Have I lost an earring?
Shit.
I love you.
-And I love you.
She's crazy.
Dad...
-Have you lost your mind?
And thank you. Very sweet.
Is she there?
-I'll come by.
Is she there?
Is everything alright?
Calm down. I am with you.
Calm down, it's okay.
What is that stench?
I'll be right back.
Chocolate milk?
Are you going to tell me how it is?
-About what?
Stop your pranks.
It's not funny.
My pranks?
That stench in Julia's room.
-I didn't do that.
That boiled crow in the garden neither?
As punishment, you can't go
to the lake today.
Your father takes you to grandpa.
No.
-You have no say in that.
Now she also cooks birds.
I'm going to change clothes.
Can I leave you alone?
I know what you're doing.
Stop that immediately.
You only see me swimming. Dead boring.
-Don’t worry.
Udder ointment.
To prevent heat loss.
A second skin against the cold.
You have the stopwatch and the whistle.
After 20 minutes you whistle, and I'll be back.
Longer is too dangerous.
How dangerous?
Then your muscles relax...
...you get sleepy
and eventually your heart stops.
That's why I need someone.
Why are you doing that to yourself?
-What?
That icy water.
I like it.
Why are you back?
I passed Grenoble.
-No.
The real reason.
To see you.
Are you mad because I went crazy?
Are you angry
because I have a child from your brother?
Twenty minutes.
Nadine.
Don't look.
Julia, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. I'm here.
Look at me. I'm here. Look at me.
Do not be afraid.
Let me help you
get rid of that girl.
Thank you.
-Come on. Sit down.
Shall I rub your legs warm?
What are you doing?
None of your business.
Are you coming to play?
-No.
Get lost.
Do not run.
Do not jump.
Liar.
Dirty slut.
Dirty liar you are.
Nadine...
-Shut up.
Stop.
You took my life away from me.
You took Jimmy from me.
-Sorry.
Stop. Sorry.
-Liar.
Dirty slut.
- Please, stop.
The mojito?
For me.
-Can I take it with me?
Are you taking it easy?
Yes, Dad.
Jeff. That's Jeff.
come.
And that's a friend?
Never mind. Too bad.
I hate these people.
come.
We're going to sing, Julia.
-You've had too much.
Come on, Julia.
We want to sing.
Total Eclipse of the Heart.
We are Julia and Joanne.
Applause for Inès.
And now hands together
for Joanne and Julia.
Come.
Thank you.
Leave me alone.
She needs to go, that lesbian fiend.
Get a grip.
Dad?
If mom hadn't married you...
...was I even born?
-How so?
If she had moved to
Marseille with Julia...
...would I have existed then?
Then you wouldn't have had a child.
Well, what a spectacle.
Vicky knows.
What does she know?
-From the two of you.
And she's not alone.
I think everyone knows.
She was talking about
Julia's sexual orientation.
What is Julia's sexual orientation then?
Well, mister sexologist? Tell.
Orientation from what?
From the wind? Of the sun?
Julia is a sunflower.
Calm down.
-God dammit.
Stop telling me to calm down.
I'm getting annoyed with you.
If I want to scream, I will.
You're crazy.
-No, you don't get it. I am normal.
A normal person, understand?
You should also try it:
scream, live, whatever.
Even when you're angry, you're boring.
Who knows, I might want to kiss you,
be a little happy, fuck you.
Are you ready?
Good, sleep on the couch.
-Wait.
Exit the room.
-Wait.
Get out.
Wait a minute, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Wait, Jimmy.
Mom.
I'm downstairs.
Mom.
-What is it?
Uno no longer moves.
-What? Show me.
He is going to die.
We have to go to the vet.
He's dead, honey.
Sorry.
Give me.
I hate her.
-Who?
Julia.
- She can't do anything about this, can she?
Yep, she's mean.
She killed him.
Why do you say that?
Do you love Julia more than me?
-What?
No.
Of course not.
Did you love me before I existed?
Chocolate milk?
Is ready.
-Thank you, mom.
Do you say goodbye? Your aunt is leaving again.
Bye.
Do you want coffee?
-No thanks.
Do you eat it quickly? We are late.
Go ahead. Have a nice day, sweetheart.
Look.
You lost that one. I found him.
Where is she?
-Who?
Do not act so stupid. Joanne.
-Oh, Joanne. I have no idea.
And I don't care one bit.
Hassle with your wife?
Are you crazy, idiot?
Are you completely insane?
Wait. Jimmy, no.
Here you go. Sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
We start this Christmas gala with our gymnasts.
Give them a warm round of applause.
There we go for the first pyramid.
Nadine. Applause for her.
With a nice twist.
Thank you
Thank you, ladies.
Keep clapping
for the second version.
Julia?
THANKS
MOM 1
To the lake.
-What? What are you doing here?
Quick, she's at the lake.
Mom.
-Shit.
There she is.
What's wrong?
-She's hypothermic. Those clothes have to come off.
Help me.
Watch out for her head.
Wait. We take off her pants
and we wrap her up.
Come on.
Pull, Vicky.
We wrap her up.
Come on, let's warm her up. Lay down.
She's ice cold.
-Lie on her, Vicky.
Wait, calm down.
-Come quick. We're at the lake.
Are you not cold?
-No.
Is Julia dead?
-No.
Could you do without her?
Could you do without Julia?
I don't know.
I do not think so.
Did you ever love daddy?
Especially when you came.
The best years of my life.
Whatever happens to me...
...it won't change anything between us.
I love you
and I always will
Okay.
Don't die.
The other got loose,
we'll fix that soon.
Ready to lift? Lifting.
Almost. Well done.
Who's going with her?
Joanne goes with her.
I'm taking Vicky home.
No, you go, Jimmy.
- Come on, honey.
Daddy?
Daddy, my daddy.
I'm with you, daddy.
