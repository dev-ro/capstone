I'm ready.
Give me Death One.
Nothing's happening.
That's impossible.
The tests on the animals were positive.
It's working.
Look!
Oh, my God.
Something's gone wrong.
This is Dr. Holder.
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm
obliged to give up work
on Death One.
Yes, that's all right.
Of course I'd be prepared to.
You can come and get it.
But take every precaution.
You see, it's very dangerous.
Yes.
Okay, here we go.
Professor Holder, are you all right?
Yes, yes.
Get after that man.
Get in the helicopter, after him.
All of you, he mustn't
get away for Christ sake.
That box is top secret.
Allen, Allen.
They have to stop him
or it'll mean the end of everything.
We got him, but he ran out.
He can't last long.
We're coming back in.
Don't be silly, I'm on vacation.
I can't do that.
So am I, and I can't
think of a better time.
Okay.
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?
Leave him alone.
But maybe he needs help.
Come on, don't get involved.
Didn't you see his face?
He looks like a homeless person.
What do you say we drive down tomorrow?
We could do that.
I want a room.
12 o'clock.
I'm sorry, sir.
We're all full up.
We have no rooms free.
I said I want a room.
In that case, we do have a room for you.
Here, sign here.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.
So, okay, we'll do that.
Consider it final then.
Three o'clock.
One thing is for sure,
the Death One compound
is far more dangerous
than any of us ever imagined.
The military consider
it an extremely powerful
bacteriological weapon.
Gentlemen, please, we'd like to be alone
with Dr. Holder and his assistant.
Do as he says.
We found the container
a few miles from here.
It was open and the file
containing the liquid
was broken.
Hmmm, there should be no danger.
The virus is extremely
sensitive to oxygen
and dissolves in less than 30 seconds
after diffusion.
But the man who stole
it is contaminated.
There were traces of blood all around,
strange colored blood.
Damn it!
A contaminated man, of course,
can infect other persons,
through breath, saliva,
blood, and any other kind
of body to body transmission.
You have to get this
man before it's too late.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it.
We'll scour the whole area.
A man in his condition
can't get very far.
Water for the guest in room four.
Oh, no.
Again?
What's he trying to do?
Get in the Guinness Book of Records?
Would you like a drink?
Oh, yes.
Okay.
Can I come in?
I brought the water, sir?
Leave it on the table.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to have
your room done now, sir?
Sir?
Hmmm.
Oh, shit.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ow.
Oh, have you hurt yourself?
Must,
must do it.
I'll get you a band-aid.
No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.
Why don't you go clean room four.
There's a disgusting smell in there.
Okay, as usual I get the dirty job,
but you get that cut medicated.
Sir?
Can I come in?
Morning, sir.
Sir?
Are you all right?
Do you need anything?
Sir?
Come on, move it, get moving!
Upstairs, get upstairs, hurry it up.
That's it, upstairs.
Leave us alone.
Come on, move it, up
there, right up there.
Come on, that's it, in there.
Get in there.
Be calm. Do as you're told
and nothing will happen to you.
Do something.
What do you want?
What?
What's the matter?
Get everybody out of the room.
Come on.
Get 'em out of the room.
Everybody outside.
Take her downstairs
with the rest of them.
Let go of me.
That's it.
Come on, get out there.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Downstairs.
Out of my way.
You can't treat me like this.
Leave it to me.
Out the way.
Oh, Jesus, look at this.
Oh, my God.
Come on, quick.
We found him!
Yes.
I see.
Evacuate the premises
and eliminate everyone there.
We'll bury them in a mass grave.
Then transport body of the infector
with maximum precautions,
you know where.
Well done, lieutenant.
You may go.
Yes, sir.
Oh, doctor, it's you.
Who told you to burn the body of the man
infected with Death One?
I had to close an episode.
The episode could open again.
Hadn't it ever occurred to you
that the ashes assimilated into the air
could fall back to Earth again?
That's ridiculous.
Pure science fiction.
Welcome, brothers and sisters,
on this hot and sunny day.
This is Blueheart welcoming
you to our beautiful bay.
I can't see the traffic,
but I can hear it say,
"You're gonna have to cool down,
there's lots of shuckin' and jivin'
all along the way."
Everybody's heading for the country.
Nature lovers, that's
what we're all becoming
as we realize the city's
are killing us with pollution
and stress.
Scientists can do what
they want with our world,
'cause we believe what
the scientists tell us.
And what they tell us
is that there are only
a few small traces of pollution left
in the upper atmosphere.
There is no danger to man.
And if the danger is
gone, so is the fear.
Now dig this hot new number.
Look what sniffing coke does for you.
Yeah, he's cooked.
Hey, guys.
This Blueheart's music's great, huh?
Yeah, making me horny.
Bo, remember the last pass we had?
Sure do.
That girl, what was her name?
Cindy, Lindy, I don't know.
I don't remember her
name, but I sure as hell
remember her tits.
Woo-hoo.
Hi.
Great.
Hey, wanna join us?
Like to get in the bus?
Say, that's the girl I'd like.
Hey, come here, hello.
We love soldier boys.
We think you're so cute.
That's her.
A beauty.
She's the girl of my dreams.
Are you real?
Now I'm a dream girl.
They're just three little soldier boys.
Yeah, all alone in the world.
Dina, why don't you let them
have one of your numbers?
Okay.
I'll get the radio.
If they're from the base,
they could be useful to us.
Suzanna's already got 'em
eating out of her hand.
Well, you know, one
of them is kinda cute.
Hey, if they get his passes,
you two could pass as soldiers too.
And then we could use their beach.
Great idea.
In a place like this,
finding beautiful girls
can be a little tough, you know?
Yes, I guess it's lucky
we have enough of 'em
to go around.
Suzanna and Carol seem
to be getting really
worked up back there.
Just look at 'em.
Ha.
Hey, maybe I'll take that one.
You already made your choice.
She's mine.
You look great.
Oh, beautiful.
You all know about that
hole in the ozone layer
caused by hairsprays and deodorants,
so why do you people keep
right on buying that stuff?
This next piece is called Nature,
and while we're on the subject,
I'd like say a few words about nature.
We've been taught that
she's a lady and a mother.
Think about her, she's made of honey,
the wonder of growing things,
she's the color of life.
I'm asking you to conjure-
What's wrong?
Why'd you turn the radio off?
Ecological bullshit.
Now even Blueheart's
become an ecological nut.
Don't smoke, don't pick
the flowers, don't fuck,
don't do this, don't do that.
Nobody can do anything anymore.
Life's become a real
ecological pain in the ass.
Now listen, if you don't
feel like my company,
we can always turn back.
No one is forcing us to
spend the weekend together.
But it's got nothing to do with you.
Well, I think nature is something
that should be considered
sacred, that's all.
Okay, but let's not
make a big deal of it.
I like smoking.
I take a toke on a
joint every now and then.
And once in a while, I
like to piss on a bush.
Am I gonna go to hell for that?
No, not for so little.
According to these Green Peace people,
we're on the brink of total
extinction or something.
Oh, my god.
What's that?
Looks like some hunter's gone crazy.
I've never seen anything so sad.
Let's get 'em off of the road.
Yeah.
Hey, look at this one.
It looks alive.
Mmm.
What could have happened?
Glen, Glen, Glen.
Let's get out of here.
Dig it, brothers and
sisters, up until now,
I've been messin' around, but right now,
I'm gonna play the
most all-consuming piece
in my collection.
Anyone who hears it, won't
be able to help themselves
getting devilishly involved
in its hellish rhythms,
so have a lovely witch's
sabbath with Peppy Satan.
You're really gorgeous, you know that?
Right this way.
Don't lose 'em in the truck.
Keep in line.
Come on, come on.
I Feel the time is now I
I Don't wanna see a thing I
I And I need I
I Don't wanna see a thing I
Hurry, Bo, that's Suzanna screaming.
Oh, my God, my friend is in there.
She's wounded all over.
She's bad, real bad.
Please, we have to do something-
There's no hospital around here.
There is a motel near here.
We better take her there.
After we've gotten
rid of the damn birds.
Okay.
I To the sky I
I But the wings are staying aflight. I
I can't take any more, Patricia.
It's burning inside.
Don't move, don't move.
I'll get some water, okay?
I'll be back, okay?
Okay.
Hurry, hurry.
I I feel that something's bad I
I I don't wanna say what I'm feeling I
I Yeah I
I I don't know that I'd only burn now I
Hello?
Hello?
I need some water.
Is there anybody here?
Um, I need help.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Nobody?
Anybody in here?
I just want some water.
Anybody here?
No!
Oh, my lighter.
Thank God.
Start.
Don't worry.
10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100.
It won't stop.
It won't stop.
Here, give me that.
Here, take a look at this.
Doctor Holder, Doctor Holder.
We must get this data to
the lab as soon as we can
and have it examined properly.
This isn't radioactivity.
This is something else.
Norma, come on.
We're gonna see General Morton.
General Morton.
Yeah.
Our instruments have detected
an enormous radioactive
cloud in the air.
That's not the worst of it.
There have been numerous
incidents of inexplicable violence
reported throughout the area.
Murders, and people
are eating each other.
Death One.
We have to cut off the epidemic area.
Cut it off?
How?
By continuing to kill
thousands of innocent victims?
You got a better idea?
Yeah, of course.
We are already working on studying
an antidote for what,
in my belief, is a virus.
We're looking for an
element which will enable us
to stop this virus from reproducing.
Fine.
In the meantime, we'll
do things our way.
General Morton, when you
asked us to work on Death One,
you should've told us
about the risks involved.
We didn't know ourselves.
You're the scientist, the brains.
We're just simple
soldiers and react as such.
Colin, Cheney.
Yes, sir.
Get the anti-contamination squad ready
and put all units on red alert.
Yes, sir.
General, if you are going to-
Doctor Holder, if you're
going to find that antidote,
do it quickly.
I can't afford to wait for you.
What happened to the hotel?
It's a mess.
Okay, this way.
Come on.
Watch your step.
Shit.
Careful.
Take it easy now.
Christ, what a disaster.
This place is unrecognizable.
I don't like the looks of this.
Wait, lay her down here.
Be careful.
There's not a soul here.
No desk clerk, no maids, no one.
How's the girl?
Not too good.
She has a high fever and there's
puss oozing from the wound.
This is ridiculous.
A week ago this place
was buzzing with life.
Now it's buzzing with flies.
Don't worry, Lia.
We'll get a doctor to see you soon.
This isn't puss, you know.
It's something much worse.
We've gotta get hold of some penicillin.
Well, I studied medicine for a bit
and let me tell you, penicillin
would be no use for that.
Well, what do you suggest?
A doctor.
This is a serious infection.
You think it's contagious?
No, why should it be?
But we should take precaution.
We need a doctor.
Well, where the hell
we gonna find a doctor
in this God-forsaken place?
Oh, Jesus, that's all we need.
I keep telling you,
we need medical help.
Can't take Lia anywhere.
Oh, my God, she's
getting suddenly worse.
Kenny, what's that noise?
It's coming from above.
I'm gonna check it out upstairs.
Yeah, do that.
This girl needs a place to lie down.
Hey, take it easy.
Come on, come on.
I found a crate full of guns downstairs.
Come on.
Here, take a look.
They're all in very good condition.
Oh, my God.
Look at Lia.
Look at those wounds.
Blood.
It's so dark.
How 'bout us going to
find a doctor together?
I'd like to go.
We ought to take her upstairs.
Yeah, she'd be much
better off in a bedroom
on a real bed.
We should wait for the others.
Hey, they found a crate of weapons
by the looks of it.
Great, we'll need them.
I think we should all move upstairs.
Come on, everybody take a corner.
We'll take her upstairs.
Easy, 985V-
Careful.
This way.
Careful.
Don't worry, it's all gonna be fine.
Slowly.
I hope I didn't ruin your weekend.
Ah, well, we didn't
have anything else to do.
You plan anything?
No, nothing really.
I'm free.
How 'bout that.
I'm free, too.
In other words, I don't
have a steady girl,
though I wish I did.
You are to shoot anyone moving
in the contaminated area,
regardless.
Your orders are to continue
closing off the area
with all mobile units,
including helicopters.
No one must get out alive.
No one.
I don't like it here.
Why is it so quiet?
There isn't a soul around.
Heck, they're probably
spending the night out.
Christ.
What's wrong?
What's the matter with this thing?
There's something wrong with the engine.
Come on out.
What is it?
Shit, we're gonna have
to go and find water
for the radiator.
L'll go.
Anyone there?
Please, answer me.
What kind of dump is this?
Listen, we're stuck because
our Jeep's broken down outside
and we need help.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hello?
Why don't you answer me?
Damn, there's nobody here.
Help!
Help!
Bo!
Help!
Help!
Oh!
This is Blueheart.
We're interrupting our music program
to make an important
announcement to all our listeners.
Something serious is happening
in this part of the world,
something extremely unpleasant.
We've been getting a constant
stream of phone calls.
There is a wave of incredible violence
sweeping the country.
Murders, rape, whole families
wiped out in their home.
Men, women, and children of all ages
are sharing the same fate.
The dead are rising up again
and murdering their own
friends and relatives,
then they eat the bodies.
The military authorities assure us
that the situation is under control.
However, we would like to list for you
the hospitals and police stations,
which are in condition to help you.
Also, places where the
desperate can take refuge
when their homes are no longer safe.
Here is Vince Raven to
read the list for you.
Santa Monica General Hospital,
the Red Cross Center at Pansolito,
Patania Police Station,
the municipal building in Santa Cruz,
the convent at Call Ria,
the military base hospital at Mumba.
Los Panos Hospital,
the Church of the Blessed
Virgin in San Antonio.
Stop!
Please, stop.
Stop.
Quick, get in.
Where are you going?
Santa Monica Hospital.
It's the nearest.
Holy mother of God, please help.
Help her.
I don't understand it.
Look at the state she's in.
Please, help her.
I just can't figure it out.
Her pulse is low.
Her heartbeat's minimal.
Her body temperature's extremely low.
Her blood pressure's zero.
It's absurd.
It doesn't make sense.
How can she still be
alive in this condition?
Please, don't let her die.
She has all the signs of rigor mortis.
I'd say she's been clinically
dead for at least two hours.
This is the first time
that I've ever seen
anything like this.
Let's just hope that Carole and that boy
come back soon.
Right, because apart
from everything else,
I don't know if this
disease is contagious.
Listen, listen, everyone.
Now this is an emergency announcement.
No one is to leave their houses tonight.
This is Blueheart.
The special branch
tactical squad from the army
has already quarantined
off the danger zones
and has issued warnings that
no one cross these boundafles
in either direction, so as
to prevent the contamination
from spreading.
The public should be
in no further danger
as long as everyone-
It's gonna get dark soon.
We're gonna have to keep
watch outside the hotel.
Please, don't go out-
I'm gonna take guard first.
We'll be bringing you regular-
R0g_
On how the situation is progressing as-
You relieve me in a
couple of hours, okay?
Okay.
Haven't eaten anything
since this morning.
I'm starving.
How about you?
Let's see if there's anything
to eat in the kitchen.
There doesn't seem to be anything here.
I'll bet that fridge is empty too, huh?
No!
Patricia, where are we going?
To the hospital, Glen.
It's all right.
We're real close to the hotel.
My friends are there waiting for me.
They'll be pretty worried by now.
I'd like to drop in.
Okay.
This is serious business, people.
Let me repeat the warning
given by Vince Raven.
No one, no one is to leave their home
for any reason whatsoever.
From now on, this station
will issue bulletins
every half an hour in association
with police headquarters,
but for the moment, the
most important warning is,
do not, I repeat, do
not go out of doors.
I'm feeling better, Patricia,
but I'm thirsty for your blood.
I can't hold him.
I gotta stop the car.
Run for it!
Run!
Get away!
Here.
Thanks.
Everything quiet?
I keep getting the impression
there's somebody watching us.
I thought I saw movement
and heard a strange sound.
Bo's been gone for more than five hours.
It is kind of worrying.
I bet you anything he's just
making out with that girl.
What a lousy situation.
Everything was great 'til this morning.
Listen, it's starting again.
It sounds like someone being scalped.
It sure does.
Nancy.
Nancy.
Nancy.
There's someone in the camper.
Who is it?
Help.
Help me.
They're coming, they're coming!
They want to eat us.
Pull yourself together.
They want our human flesh!
Oh, they're monsters, monsters!
Oh, oh.
Oh, my God, look!
There's much more that we can't see.
They'll come, they'll come.
They killed him.
Nancy, what is it?
What happened up there?
All right, everybody listen to me.
We gotta start barricading ourselves in
before these things attack.
All right, let's go!
Come on, David, move it.
Move!
This will collapse if
they attack all at once.
Well, let's hope they don't.
All right, this should
hold 'em for a while.
Come on.
Everybody, open fire.
Now!
Let him go.
Let him go!
Come on, go and join the others.
Move, move!
Damn you!
Die!
Oh.
Let's get out of here.
This place is trouble.
Jump, quick.
I'll help you.
Stay here and don't move, huh?
Easy, take it easy.
Come on, I'll help you.
Lean on me.
My damn leg.
What's up, Roger?
Wait there.
I'm going on ahead.
Stay where you are.
Roger, are you all right?
Don't come, Kenny!
Look after the girls.
Kenny, come on, there's
some canoes here.
We can paddle upstream.
Well, I think the right count on there-
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to.
You see, put-
Hey, take a look at this, will ya?
Sure, yeah.
Okay.
That's good.
Well, these combines
seem to be the right ones.
Push that one over right down here.
Could be a better one.
Could be.
Well, if we put these
two molecules together.
That might work.
We could try, anyway.
How are you progressing?
I think we might've found something.
At least we'll be able to put an end
to this useless slaughter.
Useless slaughter?
What do you want me to do?
Let the epidemic spread even further?
It won't be your weapons
that end this epidemic,
but our antidote.
My men quarantined
off the epidemic area.
By tomorrow, the situation
will be under control.
And what are you gonna
do with the bodies?
Burn them again?
Any living creature in
the contaminated area
is not gonna get out alive.
You can count on that, Dr. Holder.
Brothers and sisters,
the nightmare is over.
We have managed to
stop the horror at last.
Nobody knows how it began.
Horrors which, until yesterday,
we kept locked in our dreams,
things we dared not imagine
suddenly became reality.
People died from a strange epidemic
and then came back to
life, hunting, killing,
and then devouring other human beings.
They ate their friends
and their loved ones,
their fathers, even their own children.
We have lived through an
appallingly horrific episode,
but now, at last, news has reached us
from military headquarters,
that the situation
is fully under control.
Take your loved ones to
the decontamination squad
for treatment.
They know what to do
and will end the misery
of all those afflicted.
The decontamination
squads are disinfecting
the whole area, and special vaccines
are being given to the
victims of this new disease,
which cure them at once.
Official sources have
requested that I make an appeal.
If any of you encounter these
heroic young men in masks
and white overalls,
run to them for help.
They will help you.
I can't go on.
This whole thing's exhausting.
Oh, you're still bleeding.
I'm gonna have to
bandage this really tight.
Sorry.
I know it hurts,
grit your teeth.
Coo coo coo coo coo, bah.
You're our lunch.
Come back here.
Damn it.
Slow down, you, whoa.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Who fired?
Let's go, let's go, let's
get out of here quick.
Calling Vulture One, in Zone L
of dis-infestation North.
We found five locusts.
One is dead, but four got away.
They're heading right into your arms.
Roger, L division.
This is Vulture One.
We'll take care of those four.
We've done a mop up
operation in nearby village.
They say it's crawling
with pests down there.
Over and out.
Let's get moving.
We're getting short of fuel.
There's the village.
If we're gonna land there,
we better deal with them first.
Go ahead, Victor, kill them all.
Let's get to work right away.
Don't forget to keep your eyes open.
You don't wanna end up as
dinner for those monsters.
Keep me covered, while
I fill up with fuel.
Well, gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce
that we're about to leave you in peace.
The laboratory is no longer
in a state of emergency,
the contaminated area
has been surrounded.
It's just a matter of hours.
Before you leave, General Morton,
I should like to inform you
that the epidemic started
with the burning of the body.
Oh?
The heat mutated the virus,
made it resistant to oxygen,
and let it escape.
Go on.
None of us, none of us in the center
has been able to establish,
with any degree of certainty,
the perimeter of the contamination
in the atmosphere.
It would only take a rain shower
or some other simple
climatic manifestation
and the virus could
start to spread again.
Only this time, you would not be able
to stop the virus simply
by killing everybody
who is infected with it.
You're the scientist.
Suggest something.
Only if we find an antidote,
and we're very close,
can we have a real margin of safety.
We have to vaccinate
everybody in this region
and then spread the news
to the rest of the world,
while there's still time.
That's impossible.
Our experiments on
Death One are top secret.
You know that perfectly well.
They won't be top secret anymore
when another epidemic breaks out,
who knows where.
In Europe or the United States.
Now you're talking science fiction.
Death One brings the dead back to life.
It makes them feed on human flesh.
What do you call that, General?
Science fiction?
You created it, we worked on it,
but now there is nobody who
knows its true potential.
Just what do you want,
a press conference
on the army's use of
bacteriological weapons?
I don't want to bring
about the end of humanity.
That's philosophical sentiment,
but the truth of the matter is,
the virus has been blocked
by the course of action
that we've taken.
It's been a pleasure, gentlemen.
Tracy, Cheney.
Okay, nothing in there.
Come on.
Don't go any further.
On one side we've got murdering people
and the other, monsters.
Great.
Come on, let's go.
Take this.
What is it?
That sound?
It's weird.
There's somebody in there.
It's a creepy kind of sound.
It's coming from in there.
So, that's what we just heard.
We can't leave her here all alone.
Take this and go tell the others.
Okay. I'll look after her.
Don't worry, Nancy.
I'll be right back.
Take it easy, now.
Don't worry.
We're gonna help you.
You'll be all right.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Please,
don't let...
Kenny, Roger.
Kenny!
Oh.
Stop where you are
and do as you're told,
or we'll open fire.
Put down your weapons.
Do as instructed at
once, or you're dead.
Now we'll take you
outside to check you over.
If you behave, nothing
will happen to you.
Hey, guys, can't you see we're okay?
Hey, Rog, I got the feeling
they don't believe us.
We're all right.
Come on, can't you
see we're not zombies?
We're army, like you.
Army.
Go got 'em.
Damn fool, what's the matter with you.
We're almost there.
The baby's on its way now
and help is coming.
Push!
Push, push, come on, harder.
That's it.
Oh, Patricia.
Glen.
We'll be together again soon.
No, don't touch me.
Stay away from me!
Don't come any closer!
No, no, no!
I have to destroy you.
I have to, Glen.
Roger, give me the gun, let's go.
Glen, oh, Glen.
I had to do it, I had to.
Oh, God.
What is this?
Oh, my God.
Stop it.
Nancy, Patricia, where are you?
Look there, on the floor.
Patricia.
Patricia.
Hey, Patricia, what happened to you?
You all right?
Glen, I-
Where's Nancy?
' I L
Come on, let's get her out.
I got her.
Shit.
Come on, let's go.
Die!
There's no stopping them.
We gotta find a way outta here.
Okay.
Make it on your own, come on.
Damn it, we're out of ammunition.
Damn it.
This should do the trick.
Yeah.
That'll fix you, you freaking monsters!
I'll take a look in the truck.
Yeah, go ahead.
They're coming this way, too.
There are too many of 'em.
We'll never stop them.
Throw more gasoline,
and I've only got a few shots left.
There's a grenade.
There's a hand grenade under the truck.
Catch. What luck.
Come on, Kenny, hurry.
For Christ sake, pull the pin.
Go ahead, Kenny, hurry.
Now make a break for it.
Go!
Look!
Do you believe it?
Can you, can you fly
one of those things?
'Til yesterday, it was my job.
Come on.
Get going.
Hlcoveryou.
Move!
Go on, get in, quick.
Start the engine.
It's empty-
Looks like I've had it.
Ha.
Come on.
Jump in, Roger.
What are you waiting for?
Hang on, Roger.
Don't let go.
Hang on tight, hang on.
Goddamn it.
Hey.
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Get him.
Hey!
Don't shoot, for God's sake.
With any luck, things
will be back to normal now.
This is Blueheart on the second night
of peace and tranquility.
Dig on these immortal vibes, people.
There is nothing more to fear.
New horizons have opened up.
Those of you listening
to the sound of my voice,
know what I mean.
This is now.
The new world and the
new cycle have begun.
For everyone, this is the year zero,
so there's lots of work to be done.
I'll dedicate my next
number to all of the undead
around the world, and listen to it good.
So, it seems like Blueheart
is one of them now.
What are we returning to?
We're gonna have to fight it.
Kenny, we're going back to that?
To fight?
We're going back to win,
or humanity's done for.
I I don't know the reasons of battle I
I I feel that something is bad I
I I don't wanna say what I'm feeling I
I He's here, he's here,
he's here, he's here I
I I don't know the
time to be burned now I
I 'Cause my son could be one of them I
I I feel I'm losing the reason I
I I am tired I
I Let the fear wave
in different shades I
I Hunting no more, hunting no more I
I I can see the seagulls
right through the sky I
I By the fear, I know carried there I
I We'll be discreet I
I We'll be the dream I
I Everybody see I
I The blue, the red I
I And on the street I
I You'll find you came I
I And on your feet I
I Across the night I
I Another man I
I ls going to die I
I Everybody see I
I The blue, the red I
I And on the street I
I You'll find you came I
I On your feet I
I Across the night I
I Another man I
I ls going to die I
I And on your feet I
I Across the night I
I Another man I
