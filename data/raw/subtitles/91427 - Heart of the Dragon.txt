Let's get out of here.
Those bastards!
Do they really want to blow us up?
They don't even care about the hostages,
let alone us!
Let's take them out!
Retreat!
Spread out.
Spread out to look for them.
Hold on.
Divide and conquer.
Yes.
No one? How can this be?
Based on my experience,
one of them should be here!
Ah... I knew you guys were nearby!
Headquarters calling the SWAT unit.
Return to base.
How embarrassing!
Attention.
This practice course of the SWAT unit
has been extremely successful.
Because it has proven to me one thing.
That our SWAT team is made up of
a bunch of incompetent idiots!
With the exception of members of the
Strawberry team who played terrorists,
All other team members will cancel their
2 week vacation for additional training!
Attention.
Salute.
My aunt and my cousin always tell me
to find a good boyfriend.
But be sure not to find one
in law enforcement.
Tell me,
All this time you've known me,
have I ever asked you to change career?
No.
See. You always do as you please.
You said "one", I never said "two".
You said "turn right", I never went left.
You said you didn't like me
to work in the bar
so I switched to the restaurant.
Have you ever considered
spending the rest of your life
with such a tame and obedient girl?
No... I mean yes.
So when do you plan to propose to me?
Don't know.
What is it that you want?
You can't turn it on and off
just like that!
Hey, watch what you're saying...
I never turned it on!
How would I do that?
That's because you chose not to!
Hey, watch out! You're behind the wheel!
Stop that.
Welcome.
Remember,
starting today, you're officially with
C.I.D. Have a seat.
Thank you, Sir.
Listen, I don't care what a big shot
you're when you were with the SWAT unit.
With this transfer,
you're starting from ground zero.
Yes, Sir.
Inspector Wong.
What's the matter with you?
Haven't you ever heard of knocking?
I...
Go back out and do it again.
Yes, Sir.
That's new!
Come in.
Inspector Wong, the junkie we just
hauled in is having a fit!
He's just going through withdrawal.
Take him for some methadone.
Hold it.
This is your new associate.
Let him handle this one.
Yes, Sir.
Go with him.
Yes, Sir.
Sir, methadone doesn't do
a thing for me.
A gallon of it wouldn't even
cure my cough!
Consider yourself lucky to
get anything at all.
Get up. Here's to take you to lunch.
Car's waiting outside.
Sir, if methadone works at all,
heroine wouldn't be so expensive.
Just go.
Chubby, between women and cake,
which one would you pick?
Cake.
How about you, Ming?
Cake, of course.
I like my Mom.
But you can't eat your Mom.
My Mom knows how to bake cake...
Everybody likes cake.
I wonder why my brother prefers women.
He's probably full already.
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat in there.
Yeah.
Good idea. But what about money?
The food here is very expensive.
I have three dollars.
Only three!
I have two.
Only two!
I have ten, but it's for a pencil case.
Just tell your Mom you've lost it.
I've already lost it twice.
How about you, Chubby?
Me? I don't have any money.
Gee,
there's a hole in your pocket
and no underwear!
Oh, I have a dollar too!
Let's see... Sixteen dollars...
Not enough for food.
Thank you.
They ate a whole table of food
for only ten dollars.
Are you sure?
Yeah. I saw him pay.
How much did you tip?
Ten.
Five would have been plenty.
Five would've looked cheap.
Five was enough already.
Let's go in...
Yeah.
Wait. We need a grownup
to take us in.
What then?
Chubby, you're so tall. You may be
our Dad for a little while.
Hey, do you know what to do?
No.
You just keep scolding us
as we walk in.
"All you boys care about is food.
You don't look so excited
when it comes to homework!" Got it?
Let's go.
Hey, start scolding.
All you boys care about is food.
You don't look so excited
when it comes to homework!
Party of five? This way please.
Have a seat.
What would you like to order, Sir?
He called me "Sir"!
I want ice cream.
I want ice cream.
Me too.
Me too and add
a spaghetti with meat sauce.
I want pork chops.
All you boys care about is food.
You don't look so excited
when it comes to homework.
What else would you like, Sir?
No.
Dodo... Dad, the man asks if there is
anything else you'd like to order...
All you boys...
My Dad said there's nothing more.
No more. No more.
OK.
Wow... I still want to eat some more.
We better see
how much we have left.
Chubby, ask for the check.
Waiter, check please.
Coming.
Thank you. That'll be $115.52.
My Dad wants a cup of coffee.
I don't want coffee. It's very bitter.
I said you want coffee! One cup please.
OK, one cup please.
We're in big trouble. Where do we
get that much money to pay?
Chubby, call your brother
to come rescue us.
OK... But I don't remember
my brother's work number.
How can you not remember
your own brother's phone No?
Now you stay here,
I'll go get your brother.
I need to go home.
I'll go with you.
Chubby, you stay here.
I'll go get my Dad.
Sir, where do you think you 're going?
I want to go home.
That's fine.
Just pay the check first.
You're pretty generous. That's fine
for tips. Now please pay the check.
What's going on?
Boss, he doesn't
want to pay the check.
Are you trying to eat for free,
are you?
I don't know.
I just want to go home.
Fine. Call the cops.
No. Please don't...
Don't let him get away.
Go after him!
Stop him. He didn't pay!
Think you can get away with this?
Tie him up.
No. Don't...
Don't hit me. Stop hitting me.
You're still trying to get away?
You big fatso. Ate all that food and
think you can just walk away?
Run away?
You even brought
a whole bunch of kids with you.
And you've trashed my place.
Stop running... stop running.
Fatso, come out of there.
Open the door.
Can't get it opened.
Call the police.
Fatso.
Come on.
Hurry up.
What are you doing here?
Excuse me. I'm a cop.
Hey kid, you can't come in.
I'm a cop. Where's my brother?
Inside.
Thanks.
The fatso ate and wouldn't pay.
He's locked himself in the freezer.
What do you want me to do?
What?
I'm his brother.
Big brother, open the door.
It's Tad. Open the door!
You might as well save your breath.
I'm sure he's frozen by now.
Where the power switch?
Hurry up and turn off the power.
No can do.
The power switch is inside also.
How about the main fuse?
No good either.
The freezer has its own generator.
To keep the meat frozen
in case of power failure.
What other entrances
to the freezer is there?
You can try the air ducts.
Where is it then?
Over there.
Big Brother... Big Brother...
Here they come...
Please call an ambulance for me.
Big Brother... Big Brother.
Queer!
I'm his brother.
He's my brother...
Don't wipe your hand on the wall.
See how dirty?
Wait... That's even worse.
Big Brother, don't mess around.
Did you know fish can dive?
I've already told you to call me
if you're in any trouble.
But I've forgotten your
telephone number.
I'd better play it safe.
I'll put my number on a plate
and hang it around your neck.
I'll have a day off soon.
I'll take you to Chuck 'N' Cheese.
They have ice cream there too.
But ask me before you buy it.
If you want Ming to come,
we can take him too.
I will give you two a ride.
Don't go to the restaurant
by self anymore, understand?
Big Brother, you could drown!
I'm just trying to teach
rubber ducky to dive.
It already knows how.
Really? It doesn't stay under water.
Mr. Fung.
How do you do?
Big Brother, your tutor is here.
Come on out.
There's no rush.
Have a seat.
Hurry. It's fifty dollars an hour.
Make him earn his pay.
I'll give you a hand.
Teacher.
You've just finished taking a bath?
Do you still remember the few
English words I taught you yesterday?
Yes.
S.C.H.O.O.L.
School.
B.U.S., Bus.
School Bus.
Now show me on paper.
Okay.
I have to go out now.
You be good and listen to the teacher.
I want a soda pop.
I'll buy you some
when you finish your lesson.
Thank you very much, Teacher.
Don't mention it. It's my job.
Going out, Mr. Bing?
Yes.
I made it.
Oh, sorry, Mr. Bing.
Nuts.
I've finished, Teacher.
Write it ten more times.
Teacher, can I write tomorrow?
My brother said I've only learned
three words in a whole week's time...
Three words? You think it was
easy to teach you three words?
Who do you think you are? A genius?
You're more like
an overaged kindergartner!
Let me give your brother
$50 an hour
to teach the cows in
New Territories to read.
I have my own way of teaching.
It's called "bilk and gyp".
Do you know what that means?
I knew you wouldn't know.
Just listen to Teacher. You're wasting
your time with learning.
Just eat and sleep as much as you can.
Don't waste your youth with studying.
What is your age?
Age?
How old are you?
I'm 30, I think.
Although some people have told me
I'm an idiot for a 30 year old.
They're right. You are an idiot.
You haven't learned a thing
after all these years.
If you keep this up, you won't even be
in the 5th grade when you're 50.
Wouldn't you say
you're wasting your youth?
Then again, you don't have much
youth left to waste.
What?
Stop shedding your tears on me.
Trying to make me feel guilty?
Well, that's the way I am.
Teaching you the few days a week
makes only enough to bet on horses.
As soon as the season is over,
I won't tutor you even if you beg me
Oh, never mind.
Here, take this lollipop.
I don't want it.
I want to learn to read.
Now you're upset with me?
Mr. Fung.
Now I'll teach you a new letter, "H".
This $100 will pay for
the rest of this week. Now go.
What's wrong, Mr. Fung?
Go.
Little Brother,
I've really tried my best.
I know. I'll find you another teacher.
Now go downstairs for a soda pop.
Time off?
No.
Following a lead?
Jenny.
I'm working right now.
You want to get me fired?
The Manager is watching.
What would you like, Sir?
I would like to propose to you.
It's not that I want to say no.
But this is the wrong time
and the wrong place for this.
Jenny.
How can you propose to me
with cemetery flowers?
You want me to kill you
with this knife?
Then why do you guys use
cemetery flowers on the tables then?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
You're not serious.
Jenny...
Sir, take a look at the menu.
Let's talk later after work.
I've received an offer from
a shipping company to be a sailor.
You're want to quit your job
to be a sailor?
This has been my dream
for the past 20 years!
But you said you want to marry me!
That's my dream
for the next 50 years!
Getting married and being a sailor
are two things I've wanted all my life.
Now it's all coming together.
Life is indeed a beautiful feast.
You wish! Watch it
or you'll get heartburn!
Appetizer is sailing on a ship,
salad is marrying a beautiful girl.
What about the main course?
The main course?
It's taking care of the Big Brother.
Fung, you've certainly
got it all figured out.
One wife, one brother, one marriage.
All taken care of in one shot.
Killing two birds with one stone...
Hey, you guys...
What's more... You're only getting
married because you want to go sailing.
Jenny...
What are you all doing here?
You've ruined everything.
What are we doing? I should ask you
what are You doing?
Jenny is so good to you.
How can you treat her this way?
Marry her and then leave her home
to take care of your brother.
You want to experience
whorehouses all over the world?
What are you saying?
All right. Let's not talk about whores.
You tell me,
what is wrong with being a cop?
Being a cop...
Hey, if you dare say anything bad
about being a cop,
we won't let you walk out
of here in one piece.
He told me to...
He also told you not to go work
for the shipping company.
I've always wanted to be a sailor
since I was a child.
But you're not a child anymore.
Yeah. You only have
a brother in this lifetime.
How can you even think to
walk out on him the way he is now?
And, you only marry once too.
How can you marry her and not stay
to consummate the marriage,
but go sailing instead?
Consummate the marriage?
When did you become so dramatic?
What's so funny? Can't you be serious?
I'm trying to teach him to be a good man.
Do you want a knuckle sandwich?
We all only want what's best for you...
You wouldn't want to
let Jenny down, would you?
Look, with you sitting right here
she still gets treated like this.
What would happen to her
if you're out of Hong Kong?
Wait. With your temper
now you may kill someone.
Let me handle this one.
Don't be shy...
Gentlemen, do you not know
how to read?
What are your qualifications?
Oh, you even know English!
So what if we do?
And what if we don't?
Well, the thing is if you
didn't know how to read,
you might have mistaken
this restaurant for a whorehouse.
You are quite a smart ass,
aren't you?
So what if I am?
Waitress, check please.
Are you daring me to beat you up
right here and now?
You did the right thing.
I was wrong. I was wrong.
Hey, I got beaten up over there.
We saw it all.
Then why didn't you step in?
The were many reasons.
Mainly, if we were to fight it out here,
it would have
caused trouble for Jenny.
Then you just watched
and let people hit me?
That's about so.
Chubby, Chubby, I'm in big trouble.
Don't call me Chubby.
Call me Superman.
Whatever, Superman.
What do you want?
My school principal
wants to see my parents.
You have to pretend to be my parent.
Pretend to be who?
My father.
You don't even have a father.
You only have a brother.
It doesn't matter.
If my brother finds out
the Principal wanted to see him.
He would beat me up really badly.
He would beat you up, not me.
Please. Please help me out.
I'll treat you to ice cream.
I'm already eating ice cream.
See how much I still have left.
How about if I give you my Superman?
Superman plus ice cream then.
OK.
Let's go.
Wait. You can't see my Principal
dressing like this!
What then?
I'll take you home to change.
Do you remember
what I told you to say?
You said...
Remember, if the Principal
asks you, just say,
Don't your worry,
I will teach the little brat.
If he doesn't listen, I will spank
the daylights out of him.
Now you repeat it once.
Don't you worry,
I will teach the little brat.
Who's the little brat?
Me, of course.
Now make sure you don't forget.
I am counting on you.
Good morning, Principal.
Good morning.
This is my father.
Mr. Pang, come on in.
He didn't call me Father.
He called me Mr. Pang.
Mr. Pang means my father.
Go on in.
Please have a seat.
The purpose of our inviting
you here today is
improve communications
between the school and home.
We all know that education in school
and home must complement each other.
Pang Kwokwah is not making much
progress in school.
The homework he
turns in is always wrong.
Does he have a tutor?
Don't you worry.
I taught the little brat.
If he doesn't listen,
I'll spank the daylights out of him.
That's too severe. With kids,
we just need to be a little firm.
One more thing. He swears a lot.
I wonder if it could be bad influences
from his friends or neighbors.
Don't you worry.
I taught the little brat.
If he doesn't listen,
I'll spank the daylights out of him.
Another thing is he likes to lie.
There was one time when his classmate
was missing a pencil sharpener.
And we later found it in his school bag.
His excuse was the pencil sharpener
got into his school bag all by itself.
Another time he was tardy for over
a half an hour, and I asked him why.
He said he ran into
a monster on the way.
The excuses he used were rather strange.
I wonder if it was influences from T.V.
Or if somebody taught him?
Mr. Pang?
Oh, don't you worry.
I taught the little brat.
If he doesn't listen,
I'll spank the daylights out of him.
There's one last matter, a very serious
one I think I should let you know.
A couple days ago,
when school let out.
He molested a classmate, a girl.
What do you think of this matter?
Don't you worry.
I taught the little brat.
If he doesn't listen,
I'll spank the daylights out of him.
Yesterday, he killed a classmate.
Were you aware of it?
I taught him. If he doesn't listen,
I'll spank the daylights out of him.
Mr. Pang... You may go now.
How did it go?
The Principal asked me to leave.
Then go ahead and go.
Pang Kwokwah, you come in.
Oh, no. I'm in big trouble.
What do you think?
Isn't it beautiful?
The ship is so tall!
Big. You use big to
describe a ship. Not tall.
But it is tall.
All right. The ship is
both big and tall.
You can't even take it all in
with one look.
How do you know it's big?
Whenever you can't see it all
with one look,
it must be big.
Does that mean the sun is small then
since I can see it all?
What does that mean?
Smile means happy.
No wonder people always smile
when they see me.
Guess they're all very happy.
Listen, your little brother is
going to set sail pretty soon.
What does that mean?
That means I'll be
working on board of a ship.
Can I go on board too?
Not just yet. I'm starting
at the very bottom now.
Wait till I get promoted to be a Captain,
then I'll bring you on board.
I want to be the navigator.
Anything you want.
But before I became a Captain,
there will be a period of time
when I won't be seeing you.
You'll have to take care of yourself.
Yes, I'll take care of myself
and you'll go shipping.
No, I'll go sailing, not shipping.
Yes, then when you become the Captain,
then I'll be the navigator.
Exactly. If you run into any problems,
make sure you call me.
This is my phone number.
Grandma, I want one too.
Layoff. The stuff is not free,
you know. $1.60 each.
Here's $1.60.
Oh, that's all right.
Please take it. It keeps me honest.
Mrs. Chee, I'll count on you to
take care of my brother's meals then.
Here's $1,800 to take care of meals
for the first three months.
You could've paid me afterwards.
Why, Grandma, do you want to
charge him interest too?
Keep your nose
out of my business, brat!
My brother doesn't eat much.
Just four bowls of rice a meal.
He'll eat whatever you guys eat.
Don't worry.
I will take good care of him.
What do you like to eat?
I like Pork.
Pork? That's extra work for me.
You know, our whole family
doesn't eat pork.
I'll have to buy just for him.
Grandma, didn't we just
have pork last night?
Brat, keep your little mouth shut!
Don't listen to the kid.
I'll give a $100 a month
extra for pork then.
Here's $300.
Oh, you really didn't have to.
Mrs. Chee, a chance to
make a fast buck?
Keung, I'm going to rinse
your mouth with soap!
Hey, you still owe me
for the last three beers.
Happy now?
Why, did you pawn your
ancestors' shrine?
I would have if I could.
Big Brother,
I'll put some $5 coins in ajar.
When you need money, you can take
from there. But only take one at a time.
Mrs. Chee,
thank you so much for your help.
Don't worry.
Officer, nice day to bring
your brother out for a tan?
He has such a bad mouth!
Mr. Fung, arrest him!
I don't have the right
to arrest him now.
Of course not.
Is it illegal to have a bad mouth?
Big Brother, you go play with Ming.
Let's go.
It's so nice to be a kid. Not a worry.
I should have been
brain dead as well.
I can too be happy go lucky...
Mr. Fung, how can stand him?
It'll catch up with him.
My brother said when it's out at sea,
the sky and the sea are the same color.
Chubby, he said he's going sailing
means he's dumping you.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Why does he want to go sailing
if he doesn't want to get rid of you.
That's how my Dad left my Mom.
Chubby, you better go home and do
whatever you can to make him stay.
Fatso, what are you doing
looking under girl's skirt?
Chubby, even girls bully you!
How can your brother be
so heartless and leave you?
You didn't go play with Wah?
Look at you.
This place is a mess again.
Next time make sure you put back
the toys after playing with them.
Here. These are all five dollar coins.
Just open the lid and you can get them.
You try it.
What's the matter with you?
I don't want you to dump me.
Me, dump you?
Don't be silly. I wouldn't do that.
Your going sailing
means you're dumping me.
Bobby's father did the same thing.
Everyone says so.
Don't listen to other people.
I wouldn't leave you.
I'll die first before I let you dump me.
You want to dump me?
I'll kill myself first.
Don't. Don't. Are you crazy...
Go away.
Crazy... Who's crazy?
Dump you? If I could dump you,
I would have dumped you 20 years ago.
I didn't have to wait till now.
I'm so happy now?
Always having to worry about you.
Worry that you may be hungry,
cold, unhappy.
Worry that you may get lost
or get picked on.
If it weren't for you,
I would have seen the whole world.
I wouldn't have been stuck here
in this little rat hole.
You, even now, you don't know
how to take care of yourself.
I am a person too.
I have dreams and ambitions too.
I can't sacrifice everything for you.
I am not so noble.
I have thought about strangling you
first and then commit suicide.
Then both of us
would have been better off.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you be a man?
You're over thirty years old,
do you know that?
You're not a kid anymore.
You're a grownup.
I am not a kid.
I want to be a grownup...
Excuse me, are you hiring?
Looking for a job? Ask the boss.
Yes?
Are you hiring people here?
What kind of experience do you have?
Then what can you do?
I know how to be Superman.
Superman. Can you fly?
Sure.
Let's see.
Here comes Superman. I fly...
I'm done.
May... May.
What's matter?
How much do you need?
No. I want you to see this.
See what?
Chubby, let's see you
fly one more time.
Good.
Here comes Superman... I fly...
Oh, he's crazy.
Not bad for a nut case.
I'm done.
You did a good job. But we do not
hire Superman to work here.
What else can you do?
I will do anything.
Do you know how to wait on tables?
On tables? Sure.
Here, I'm on the table.
Come back down first, Chubby.
OK.
Where did you find this nut case?
He came in here himself.
It's so sad. Don't tease him anymore.
Don't be silly.
You think I'll hurt his pride?
Did I do a good job?
Chubby, this is not a
good job for you.
Working like a dog, it's very tiresome.
See, it's not me. The lady boss
worries that the work is too hard.
You have to work like a bull...
A bull? I can be a bull.
Let me show you.
Bull. Bulls work in the fields.
Yes
I can do that.
Chubby!
Let him try.
Chubby. Don't do it. Don't do it.
Is it because I didn't do a good job?
Of course. Do you know how to be
a hungry dog looking for food?
When dogs are hungry,
they'll fight to eat whatever they see.
Now show me.
OK.
Go ahead.
Chubby, don't do it.
Let him.
Chubby, that was a pretty good dog.
Now how about an eel?
An eel?
That's right. A white slippery eel.
Crawling and sliding on the ground.
So you'll hire me if I do a good job?
Sure. Who else could I hire?
He's really crazy.
Not too bad at it either.
Yan, it's you.
What are you doing here?
I'm interviewing for a job.
I almost got one.
You've done enough.
Are you ashamed of yourself?
If I were I wouldn't have done it.
I can do anything.
What would you do
if he were your son?
If he were mine, I would've
strangled him with my own hands.
Are you alright?
Hey what's this?
Shut up,
otherwise I'll let you have it too.
Let's go.
They said they're going to hire me.
Forget it. They won't hire you.
How can you send your brother
to look for work?
Enough. Enough.
Enough? You think you can
just cover your ears to this?
Do you know how they
made a fool of your brother?
They had him on the ground acting
like a dog, a bull and even an eel.
I know... because you've
told me a hundred times.
How can you feel nothing?
I feel nothing? You think I wanted
any of this to happen?
What would you do
if he were your brother?
If he were my brother,
I would protect him and love him.
If he were my brother,
I would never have let anyone
bully him and pick on him.
The two of you. Please don't fight.
I would never be heartless like you.
How can you pretend not to see,
not to hear
when your brother
gets abused like this?
Are you even human?
I don't want to argue
with you anymore.
So I can't see, I can't hear. So what?
I am ashamed to call myself
your friend. I'm leaving.
Little Brother, don't cry.
Big Brother, don't be mad at me.
I won't. It was all my fault.
Kick the ball over here.
Please.
Little Brother.
What's wrong?
You're not having fun?
You said to go on a picnic.
Been here an hour, just watching
you and your brother play soccer.
What's so fun about that?
Let me kiss and make it up to you.
He's coming. Go play soccer.
Come on.
Is that a consolation prize?
Your brother is back again.
How far can you kick the ball?
Watch me.
Come on.
Now there's enough time
for us to do anything.
Hey, you've lost your mind?
In broad daylight...
I wish the ball
would fall off the cliff.
Me too...
Big Brother...
Mr. Kim, how about a 20% discount
from the price you quoted me?
20% discount?
What do you take me for?
Mr. Kim. Take it easy.
We're both businessmen.
A little bargaining is commonplace.
If 20% is too much,
how about a 15% discount then?
You're a businessman. I am a thief.
My men risked their lives
to get the goods.
They did not get a bargain then
and I will not bargain with you now.
Don't take me for a fool!
Cops.
Cops.
The goods.
Don't worry, Boss.
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't move!
What's going on?
Where are you doing?
I have reasons to believe that the goods
in connection with the Queen's Jewelry
robbery last week are here.
Inspector Wong.
Yes?
Someone escaped through
the back of the hill.
Take some men to the back to search.
Yes, Sir.
Who was that at the back of the hill?
You're funny. How do I know?
Why don't you also ask me
who it was picnicking
at the Peak too?
Inspector Wong, the back side
is a steep slope. He escaped.
Excuse us, Mr. Kim.
Would you check
if you have anything stolen?
No need for that. If anything,
consider it my gifts to your men.
Let's go.
Yes, Sir.
It's a wrap.
Jesus Christ.
What is the matter?
There are many sinners in this world.
What more do you want?
I've already died on the cross for you!
Can you die one more time?
No. Are there no more cops
in the world?
They are all on vacation.
All right then.
I'll send you the Assassin,
to Earth, to destroy all sinners.
Yes
Heading to Earth. Charge!
Oh, no. Jesus has sent the Assassin
to come after us.
Let's run.
Can't get away this time.
Are you all right?
Boy, it really hurts.
Oh, you robbed someone.
I didn't.
It wasn't me either.
But you scared him with your gun.
I wasn't even playing with him.
But he didn't know that.
Now you're a robber.
Him too. He was playing too.
Wonder what's in the bag?
If my brother finds out I
robbed someone, I'll get a big scolding.
He won't know if you don't tell him.
Then let's go. Let's go.
Go? What about the bag?
How about if we hide the bag
and promise not to tell?
Hide it? Where?
You just pick it up and follow us.
Now don't anyone tell about this.
What if someone did? Then what?
I don't know.
Let's swear to it.
Should I, Leung Chiman,
tell anyone about this,
my Dad will drop dead.
Your turn.
If I tell anyone,
my Dad will drop dead too.
Your Dad died a long time ago.
Then who should drop dead?
Your brother.
I don't want my brother to die.
I don't want my Dad to die either.
If you don't tell, he won't die.
Hurry up and swear!
If I tell anyone about this,
my brother will drop dead.
If I tell anyone my brother
will drop dead too. Let's go.
I'm afraid you will be recognized.
Yeah, you'd better
stay home for a while.
Hello, hold on.
Boss, it's Fat.
Hello
Boss. It's me.
Fat, are you all right?
I'm fine, but the cops
have gotten the goods.
What? The cops got them?
Yes. What should I do now?
That's all right. They're not worth
that much anyway.
Don't come back here yet.
Wait for me at the Oasis Restaurant.
OK. I'll wait for you there.
Fat is playing games.
He wants to swallow the goods.
Take care of him.
Yes.
Sorry.
No problem.
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?
Give me back my car!
Who is it?
C.I.D.
You're Tsou Chifa?
Yes.
I was the one who called.
Can you tell us your
motive and request?
I volunteer to be a police witness
in prosecuting Kim.
In exchange, I would like to
have police protection.
The police don't protect just anyone.
What do you have on him?
I've been with him for over 10 years.
I have proofs for his many crimes.
Plus the goods the police
confiscated this morning.
Regarding the goods you mentioned
on the phone, I've already checked.
The police does not have it.
Are you kidding me, Officer?
It was your man
who took my bag at gun point!
Mr. Tsou, how can you
be sure that he was a cop?
Or have you decided
to keep the goods yourself?
Keep the goods myself?
You think I've lost my head, Officer?
You know Kim well.
If I've taken the goods, he'll make sure
I will not live to enjoy them.
So you lost the goods. And you're scared
to death that he'll come after you.
Therefore you've volunteered
to be a police witness.
You're quite a bastard?
An eye for an eye!
Even without the goods,
I can still get him!
Let's go and arrest him now.
I'm the one who's
calling the shots here.
Fung, you continue to
keep an eye on Kim.
I'll assign someone else to this case.
Yes, Sir.
Two of you stay here to watch him.
Without my order,
he is not to leave with anyone.
Yes, Sir.
Stop. We're C.I.D.
What's up, Sir?
Against the wall.
What did I do, Officer?
Nothing. I just don't like
the way you look.
Now I have a few questions for you.
Do I have to answer them.
You don't have to.
Have you seen this person?
Look carefully.
Well, have you seen him?
No.
You may go now.
Let's go.
Brother.
What's Chubby up to these days?
I don't know.
You don't know? Then why are tons of
cops looking for him?
Hey. He's acting peculiar!
Open the door. Chubby. Open the door.
What's happening, Wah?
What are you looking for?
Where is your brother?
In the bathroom. Why?
There are cops looking for you?
Why?
Because you've robbed
someone last time.
I didn't robbed anyone.
What do I do now?
Let's take that bag to the police.
OK.
Let's go then.
Come on.
What do you think is inside the bag?
Don't know. Let's take a look.
Look at all this jewelry.
Put them back. Let's go.
OK.
Chubby. Chubby.
They're now bringing Chubby up.
Looks like he'll be fine.
That's him. That's the fat guy.
Are you sure about this stuff?
I haven't heard of any jewelry store
robbery lately.
Don't blame me if you're slow.
All right. I'll take $10,000
for each one.
But you have to take them all
off of my hands.
For that I have to
inspect the goods first.
When I see the money. You think I'd
walk around with all that jewelry?
Not bad? Just like that,
you've turned into a millionaire.
That's fate.
Yeah, you're lucky.
The money is here.
What's the matter?
What's the matter, Mister?
How did you get the goods?
What goods?
I'll talk. I found them.
You found them?
Where are the rest of them?
At my house.
Oh, it hurts.
Now you know.
How did you fall off the hill?
I was pushed.
Pushed? Who pushed you?
A man in a mask.
Mask?
Yes. He was incredible.
He just gave me a kick
and I fell off the hill.
Don't go there to play anymore.
I didn't go there to play.
I went to pick up something.
What did you pick up?
I... I can't tell you.
If I told, you would die.
I've sworn to it.
I won't die. Just tell me.
Sir, come on in.
Come in.
Have a seat, everyone.
Why is everyone standing?
You are under arrest in connection
with the robbery at Queen's Jewelry.
What?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used
against you in the court of law.
Wait, Sir. My brother just
got out from quite a scare.
I'll be responsible for bringing him
into the station tomorrow.
Nonsense. This is an official arrest.
You should know better than
to interfere with this.
Sir, my brother is mentally retarded.
Mentally retarded?
So he could rob people at gun point?
Sir, can you tell me
what is this all about?
Fellows, take him in.
Sir, can you let me
take him into the station?
Shut up!
Don't take me away!
Don't move!
Don't do that. It'll scare my brother!
Don't, please.
Don't, Big Brother.
Sir, we don't see him
Sir, we lost him.
We lost him.
No sir.
We lost him.
Do you know by your actions today,
I can bring on 4 charges against you.
Sir.
Now, don't ever say
I didn't give you a chance.
I think you can find your brother.
I hope you bring him to see me tomorrow.
Thank you, Sir.
Let's go.
Could he be at Wah's home?
Go. What are you looking at?
Lets' go.
Why would Keung
be with these guys?
The cops are after you?
Did you say anything about me?
No. I didn't say anything.
You may hide here for a little while.
But when my brother comes back...
My brother's back.
Just hide in there.
Remember, don't make a sound.
Big Brother.
He has nothing to do with it.
Leave him alone.
Cut the bullshit.
Where are the goods?
In the closet.
Just go in and get it.
Hurry.
Hurry up.
Who is this?
He's my brother's friend,
but he's retarded.
Take the stuff out.
Big Brother.
Freeze.
Little Brother.
Don't touch him.
Don't come any closer.
Morning, Boss.
Boss, we've found the goods.
It really wasn't Fat after all.
But I have leads that he's planning
to be a police witness.
He wants to sell me out.
Boss, let me take care of him.
There's no way.
He's under police protection.
Get up.
Are you taking me to dinner?
Yes, to dinner.
Who the hell is this?
He is the brother of a cop,
but he's retarded.
Where can we find your brother?
I don't know.
He's usually the one who finds me.
What's that?
My neck.
Hello. Speaking.
How's my brother?
I'm warning you not to
mess with my brother.
Your brother is safe for now.
Come speak to your brother.
When are you going to come get me?
Good enough. Eat your apple.
Listen up. I want to see Fat tomorrow.
Or your brother is a dead man.
What should I do now?
Wow. This is over our heads.
We better go by the book.
No. If we go by the book,
there's no way the bastard,
Inspector Wong, will let Fat go
Don't in charge of the fatso.
He's more concerned about arresting
Kim than saving my brother's life.
But...
But for us...
But...
You don't need to say anything.
Are we friends?
Why didn't I tell anyone
but the four of you?
Yes, why?
Why? You're asking why now?
My brother has one foot in his grave
and you're asking me why?
All right. All right.
Sorry we're friends.
What do you want us to do?
I want you to help me get Fat out to
exchange for my brother.
What happens after that?
Then we'll get Kim and all
those bastards while we're at it.
Wow, that's no piece of cake!
That's why I'm asking for your help!
When then?
Now.
It's Fung. Come in.
I have to take him in.
Are you kidding? What's up?
I can't tell you, but I must take him.
No one can leave with him without
Inspector Wong's orders.
Log and Yan, let them see the order.
We have reports that someone is
trying to abduct the police witness.
Immediately block off the hotel and
bring the witness to police headquarters.
Yes, Sir.
What happened?
Super is here.
For dim sum?
No. He brought with him
a whole squad.
He found out so quickly?
That's big trouble for us!
Let's give it up!
Give it up!
What about my brother?
With Super taking charge personally,
it's not that easy to get through!
I don't care who's in charge.
You guys stay here
and are on your own.
I'll create a diversion.
Meet me at Shatin.
Stop him.
You guys go on ahead. Be careful.
We'll take care of ourselves.
I'm talking about my brother.
Log and Yan, let's really help Fung out.
Yes. Let's do it.
Where is my brother?
Your brother is right here.
He'll be fine.
You let my brother go now.
Where's my brother?
In the basement office.
Don't move.
Hurry!
Over there...
Over there
Don't stop me.
This is my occupation.
Good thing I got back here in time.
You'll all have to die either way.
Go to die!
Let's go up.
Follow us.
Yes Sir.
When you get out,
maybe you can work for me again.
How come you didn't even let me in?
And it's a good thing you didn't.
You're in trouble this time.
I really didn't know anything.
Hurry.
Lets' go
In the words of a child I've said
Till the end of time
I will hold your hand in mine
Laughter or tear
I never regret
Never thought we'd
go our separate paths
This love, nurtured since we were small
had led me to forget freedom
Yet it's fate that we cannot
battle side by side
How do you mend a heart that's blind.
How long can this last?
Our love is like the ocean
that never rests
My heart aches when we're apart
Who can really stay together forever
Even if willing to give up the future
I beg that you understand.
As years passed
You have left your footprints
on my mind
Seasons come
Seasons go
This love of ours stubbornly hangs on
This love, nurtured since we were small
had led me to forget freedom
Yet it's fate that we cannot
battle side by side
How do you mend a heart that's blind.
How long can this last?
Our love is like the ocean
that never rests
My heart aches when we're apart
Who can really stay together forever
Even if willing to give up the future
Our love is like the ocean
that never rests
My heart aches when we're apart
Who can really stay together forever
Even if willing to give up the future
Look ahead and let go of the sadness
Come to see there is no need to seek
Whether we'll always be together
For when we are apart
I can always feel your heart
close to mine
