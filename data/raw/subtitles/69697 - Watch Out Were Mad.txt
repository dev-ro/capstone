Come on, pull out.
Come on!
Com on  baby!
Come on.
Get out of my way!
Oh yeah?
Number three Big Ben

The race is finished
by the numbers one and three!
Kid still has the belt on!
Ben gets out and goes all the way!
Kid goes through the windshield.
Kid recovers and are at par!
They are tied!
They are tied!
Hey.... beautiful thing.
The kid ... he is still inside?
Yeah.
What's up?
I'm being precautious.
You what?
I just don't want you to take the buggy
before we decide whos it is
Hey I dreamt the same thing about you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I dreamt that you took the key
out of the ignition...
...went over to your strongbox,
...put it in
closed it all in the locker.
Right?
Do you wanna play high card?
Aces high.
Whoever wins gets the buggy.
Listen.. you are not driving my tail.
Do you think I'm a cheat?
You are damn straight.
Hmmm, I'll arm wrestle you for it
- That because you afraid I'm too strong, huh?
- Yeah.. you're damn staright.
There is no need to hate each other.
It is very easy...
I get the keys to the buggy...
When you feel like to steal it,
you come to me.
Hm thats fair.
- Who wants to hang around here?
- Who wants you to hang around here?
Do not fight, muchachos!
I have a marvellous idea.
It would be marvellous..,
.. but I can't remember it.
Hey you guys. Can I have a try?
Make way for the big man
How about a beer and hot dog contest?
How is that?
You drink a beer,
eat a hot dog.
You drink a beer,
eat a hot dog ...
Whoever quits first pays the bill
lose the buggy.
Okay.
Where?
Over there
Looks like a qiuet, cozy place.
- Hey who's the girl?
- How should I know?
You live next door to the park
and you don't know?
If you forefeit,
then I win ...
A vanilla sundae,
a be havy on the whipped cream!
Good for indigestion.
Try it sometime.
Stop that.
Clear!
Get back!
The park is closed ...
I mean closed!
Next one to move.....
You knew they were going to throw that?
No. Just that the  cigars
bother me.
Nice quiet place, huh?
Well it is on weekends.
Hey. you are right behind.
Do you think we outta clear out of here?
Okay.
But then I win.
Get out or I'll smash it.
No. No, Don't smash it.
Do you give up?
You know the story of the tortoise
up against the hare?
Lets  continue some place else, huh?
- You know what a tortoise is?
- It is a turtle.
No it's like a bullfrog.
Well... we will pay the bill later
I do not want to hurt
the establishment.
After all, the food is not THAT bad.
Yeah, but the service is a bit shabby.
- Where do you wanna go?
- You 're the driver.
Columbia beer parlor?
No. The hot dogs are too small.
- How about the the bar San Diego?
- Beer is too hot.
Where?
Los Caracolles.
It's a nice place.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Get out or I'll smash ye!
I beg your pardon?
I said, get out!
What for?
If you don' come out
I got to splat the car.
But why do you have to splat the whole car?
Because I gotta...
What did he say?
He said he gotta..
Now.. does that sound like a reasonable answer?
Sorry for your car.
Sorry about YOUR car.
When I say pull off a good job...
I mean pull off a good job.
Right, Boss!
I mean no bangling, right?
Allright, Boss!
Get out. All of you!
Well Doctor? Do you approve?
This is a waste of time.
I told you over and over again ...
being evil is a virtue
but you must use it properly.
You know very well that I am
bad number, Doctor.
Really quite bad!
I'm so bad...
..that I even give myself the creepy boo's.
You have a long way to go.
You're afraid of being truly evil.
Thanks to you Doctor, I have been quite naughty.
I am very sorry, Senor.
Next time.. watch where you put your feet, you oapf!
these infantile pranks gives you false
delusions of power.
You must be more
truly wicked,
if you want REAL delusions of power.
It was an accident! Accident...
Here you witnessed the law of the jungle.
When you trip off the waiter,
because as you are the boss,
everything is honky dory.
But when I trip off the waiter
because I'm not the boss I get stipa dini.
I should hope so
After all, Doctor
I AM the king around here.
The king around here? The king of what,
The king of this..chicken coop?
King of a few measly protection rackets,
That's small potatoes!
With my
professional guidance,
to the deep recesses of your psyke
.
You can really hit the big potatoes
Do you know why I told you to knock down
the beer house?
So be it.
To frighten the boobs
..into paying the
protection money ....
Now ...
You will listen to my plan.
You must frighten the people,
into leaving the amusement park.
And on this site.
Build a appartmnent house.
Appartment house....!
A skyscraper
The biggest in the world.
Oh bully bully..
and that will be all mine!
Yours and mine too.
- Yours too?
- I'll get the take the penthouse,huh.
Relax, what's eating you?
You're honking up your fee, aren't you Doctor?
Hardly!
You know that I deserve it.
With my psychology
you will have more lick in yout feet.
You are King of the Castle ...
and you are filthy rich.
And I am 10% filthy rich.
I do not understand,
It never happened before.
It was destiny.
One thing I can't stand is a bully
A bully!
How about a pain in the neck.
The guys who wrecked our buggy were bullies
.
You don't say...
- You know what?
- No, I couldn't care less
Do you know what?
I'll tell you.
Since the buggy is gone,
why do not you take your truck,
and roll out of here?
Okay, I going.
I am going straight to the bullies..
and ask them for a brand new buggy
A brand new buggy!
I am going.
- What are you waiting for?
- For you.
You're not studying,
the chorus are not taking to you.
You sound like a bullfrog.
Why aren't you coming?
Too much trouble... trouble
job
job
But ... If I get the buggy back, it's all mine
Get the buggy from them.. fat chance.
It is all mine?
- I have to study my part
- Then it is all mine.
- Hey but you do not know who wrecked the auto.
- I know, I know.
Real mean guy.
Very ...
very mean.
- May I have the pleasure?
- The pleasure is all yours.
Boss!
Those two guys from this morning
were trying to get in, but ...
I kicked them out...
Relax, we will be right back for the next dance.
- Get rid of them!
- Relax.
Don't bother.
We're leaving anyway,
after a word with you.
- We wanna have three words with you.
- Four.
- Why four?
- We want our buggy.
Yeah, thats four words:
We want our buggy!
Buggy?
What buggy?
The car you wrecked us?
Now.. you shouldn't have done that, sir.
We were very attached to it.
Do you realize who you are talking to?
He means well,
it'is just that he is allergic ...
Tell him.
I don't think you know who I am.
You're the guy who wrecked our buggy.
Your are gonna buy us a new one.
Right, Boss!
sorry!
This here is our name
and address.
We want it just like it was.
A brand new dune buggy
You may have the courtesy to
to deliver it at home.
You got until noon tomorrow.
Otherwise?
-Otherwise we get mad.
- Heh, we'll get mad
Oh by the way do not forget ...
Not just any dune buggy
It gotta be red
with a yellow tarp.
Your're not thinking off giving in to them?
You got the psychology
all mixed up.
Listen to the wisdom of this
Professor Freud!
These two here are just kids
they are undergrown men
they think you're their father figure.
You are the father they want
their little toy back.
They want their little dune buggy.
And is daddy going to give them back
their little dune buggy?
You must be the strong father.
You slap tkhem, you slap them, you slap them good,
Then you will have two nice
obedient children
.
Attila, get them!
Did you have to wave to him?
I was only being polite.
Boy she was realy dirty, wasn't she?
Yeah, I don't have time to clean it.
I don't think they got the point
that we want our buggy back
So we have to set them straight
It think he got the point this time
Hey.. I said I think he got the point this time
- What do you think?
- I doubt it.
- What do you think of a drink?
- Oh yeah.
Your change.
Try your strength, senor
- I don't get nothing?.
- You didn't make it go around
Choose your prize senor.
That's a lot of muscle,
I wont be easy to get your point at last.
That guy got muscle
Try your strength!
A prize for each round.
- Want to try, senor?
- Yeah
Six!
I got no more prizes!
- I say he got the point.
- I say he didn't.
When I say he got he got it.
You got it?
So why are we tailing him?
I'm not tailing him,
I'm following you, you idiot.
Incidentally,
what am I following you for?
Two guesses ...
I've got it.
After you.
Just get in.
What is going on?
Come on in, the water is fine.
Yeah the water is fine.
What do you worry about?
Everything.
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- I did it on purpose.
Me too!
No don't do it!
I told you not to!
Pull up your two!
Not the arm!
Not now.
Not now.
You knew all the while this was a setup?
Up you go!
You will get that buggy tomorrow
at twelve o'clock.
Wait, we are not through yet.
Not just any dune buggy.
It gotta be red with a yellow top
The dune buggy you want.. It has to be red?
-And the top has to be yellow?
-That's right.
It took me all night
to pull it together.
is a little bit old fashioned,
but ...
it's not too expensive.
You better take this dune buggy
and not fool around with
with those peoples.
I know what I'm about to talk.
In my days ...
I was a big gangster.
Easy, Jeremiah.
Well ...
It came after the boss.
I was a cook in his favorite restaurant.
That's better.
- How come you know that?
- You told me a thousand times.
The golden boy is up early this morming.
Want a spot of tea,
old chap?
Yes, and some garlic bread.
No...
As well.
- Hey where are you going?
- Over there.
After a hard day
the body needs relaxation.
Don't forget that we are expecting company
at twelve o'clock, huh?
.
Why do you have to leave?
Because they are gonna build a
a skyscraper on this site.
I mean you are going away and I
am staying?
A huh.. thats about it.
And to think going out with me
is not something that happens
everyday.
I mean I'm sorry I have to leave..because
I was born here.
Who knows where I'll end up.
Up in the wheel.
Around around it goes. And getting something out of this,
thats our business, right?
Let's hope they don't see us.
It's no harm just to take a look around, is it?
.
No don't do that.
The park is supposed to be closed.
They blow it up otherwise
Thats what they said.
Will you run a ferris wheel
with no music?
We will be there in two minutes,
boss.
Excellent ...
Mind you, though...
At noon exactly...
You get me?
Super idea you had, Doctor.
With this here two way radio
we can follow the fun
by remote control.
And at high noon we will go
full cycle.
Technology, efficiency,
organization!
You can't fool society if you
sound like a pussy cat
I sound like a pussy cat?
Listen to the roar of the 20th century.
There they are. I told you
they would come after us.
No, they are coming after me.
It's nothing to worry about.
I'll see you later.
Ten minutes.
It's twelve noon.
We have come to deliver a red dune
with a yellow tarp.
Where is it?
Right before your eyes.
Beautiful, huh?
She's a beaut allright.
You okay?
They brought our dune buggy.
- Yeah beautiful. Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, yeah.
Pretty, ain't she?
Shiny red and with yellow top.
- Just like I wanted it.
- Thats what you asked for.
Well, the boss said :
Give them what they want.
There she is
That's what the boss said.
You ask for it you'll get it, right?
Right, absolutely right.
Have them try it out.
Go out! Take it for a spin.
What's the matter?
Listen, how do you like the...
I know...not bad.
But I was hoping it would be more...
more... more...
You know?
Yeah, me too..
What's the matter?
Can't you tell a good thing when you see it?
Yeah, that just the point. I can't...
I can't see it!
You can not do that.
What's going on?
Forget about me,
Ater him.
- Where was he?
- Over there.
He got my bike!
Tthe inevitable happened, Boss.
Did you break his arm?
His back? His head?
Speak up, man.
What's happening?
I'll take the boys out for ride in the country
We're doing fine, Boss!
You can't go wrong with this bumch.
They are all winners.
Sorry about that.
hey you can't miss this one, Chief
Live from your reporter.
I go down, he starts swinging. I'll duck.
He doesn't see the tree and hits it head on.
What's going on then? What's going on?
He swings, I... whoa ...Kick..and
Mission accomplished. Over!.
Did he break his head, boy??
He went dead.
You are doing great, lads..
He went against the tree, smashing...
Yes, but the loser happens to be one of our guys
It's not who wins,
It's how the game is played.
Cut that out,
you're scaring the cows!
What's happening, over?
Keep calm, Boss,
We're flying high.
hey, what is this?
I think one of your boys
joined the Navy.
Rotten traitor,
I hope he drowns.
I told you before...
your sadistic is a waste of time.
Carry on,
What are you waiting for?
Take it easy, General. We are doing
the best we can.
Let's get the big guy.
Uh, not the back.
What's happened. Who's out?
The show is over, boss.
The show is over?
You can't do...
My wonderful scheme is kaput..
10% of nothing, I get
You think you are the big wolf
but you are just a little chicken.
Where are the others...
Get the others.
What others?  The have all been beat
I knew it. We should have had
50, 100, 150.
You couldn't win if you had a whole army.
Next time I will...
And have it all televised ...
in color.
There... you are looking at him.
Paganini ...
The finest exterminator of peoples
on the market.
He's a one time jolly
One shot and you're dead, forever.
He is what you call a virtuoso.
No klinkers for Paganini.
The most instrumental member of
the Chicago underworld.
For absolutely no reason does he part
from his so beautiful instrument.
A Remington 70-70 repeater.
It is clever cookie,
Cunning, crafty,
tricky...and smart too.
Nothing frightens him.
He has no nerve,
no heart, no pity. Nothing.
This Paganini
is my prescription for you.
Just two birds from his magic repeater and ...
We have no more problem.
So.. he don't cost peanuts. but
what are you gonna do?.
We might just as well bought him the crate.
One lousy bleeding rotten dune buggy.
They are playing this double or noting psychology.
You give them the dune buggy..
and they ask you a jumbo jet.
You give them a jumbo jet and they
want our skyscraper.
As a hangar
- What's that? They are back.
- Who?
The guys on the motorcycles.
What's the matter?. Are you afraid?
Scared, huh?
No, It's just that I don't wanna
ride one of those contraptions.
They didn't give us back the dune buggy
And so?
So I'm warning you that I am mad.
Well I am not.
If you don't like, you can split.
Listen there a man dressed in black parked in that black car
parked just across the way.
Would you describe him as a killer?
Well, I consider the possibility.
When the shooting start, the fun is over
Leave him alone.
Will he leave us alone?
Don't count on it.
- Well. I'll be seing you
- Are you gonna take him by surprise?
- No, I'll take him seriously. I'm getting outta here.
That's enough.
Let's pick up from  eh ...
No. 4,
male voices.
You should have taken him by
surprise.
I thought you ditched him?
Pay attention.
When you get a chance take a look,
up there.
Would you say you have seen him before?
How did he get in here?
He followed me in here
I didn't feel like dying alone.
Possibly not!
Go back to your place!
Immediately!
Got him.
To your genius
and my wickedness.
I always like your plans, Doctor.
Especially when they work.
Have you heard anything like this?
Do not look at him.
Just ignore him.
You're not waiting them to throw
him out just like that.
- Thats enough.
- Don't tip him.
What wrong?
What's going on, Doctor?
- That music!
- It's some crazy bastard!
I do not want any strolling musicians
in my restaurant.
Throw him out.
- The hands.
- Whose hands?
Your hands.
- Where?
- On the table!
Now you see him then you see him again.
Who is he?
Come on. You're supposed to be the big cheese here.
You know him? Come on. Give me the answer!
Oh yes. I know him.
That's Jeremiah.
He used to be the cook here.
Super on the dumplings.
No, no.
all balony, no.
My intuition tells me
this is the real enemy.
This dumpling maker is the master mind
.
Without him these two boys
would be like sheep,
they are instruments in his hands.
We have to strike at him,
to destroy them!
What are you mad about?
What did I do now?
Thank to you,
I got thrown out of the chorus.
And as if that wasn't enough,
You nearly got me killed!
- Do you really want me to go?
- You're damn straight.
You want that buggy.. go get it on your own
I'll see you around.
Only by accident.
No, don't hit me no more.
I do not know nothing. Please.
Jeremiah!
It's me, Ben.
It is you.
They beat me
because they think ...
...I am the one behind everything
Tell them, Ben. Please.
I am nobody.
I want no dune buggy.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was just passing by ...
Heard the music
..so I said to myself
Why don't you have some fun?
What do you want? huh?
Open up.
If I don't. What's gonna happen?
Yoú'll get mad?
- We are already mad.
- We are already mad.
Oh, that's too bad.
We're having good times.
I can't let you in.
You see.. this is a private party and low class bums
aren't invited.
- Are you really gonna do it?
- Yeah.
You still mad?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
Not the arm!
I need it.
Is it for me?
- Is there? Is anyone there?
- Nobody here.
How is this for service?
- It's better than walking.
- Just don't get used to it.
Come on out.
Take it easy old man. It aint nothing.
- Do you mind?
Being prudent of nature
and tender of heart,
we give you these...
before we... ahh ...
- part.
- Part.
The park is open!
Everyone in.
- Great, isn't?
- Super.
Most... extra ordinary.
Do you wanna play high card?
No.
I'll arm wrestle you for it
No.
How about a beer and hot dog contest?
Where?
