'Snehalata Taurani Girls' Hostel'
'Ma'am!'
Ma'am.
Where is he?
- Where is the guy pretending to be a girl?
- Yes.
- Excuse me!
- Huh?
A boy broke into the girls' hostel.
Where is he?
Yes. We received a complaint.
Sir, only girls stay here.
There seems to be
a misunderstanding.
- What?
- Inspector.
In that room.
Sir, hang on. Where are...
Hang on, sir.
There are only girls here.
You're mistaken.
You can't barge in there!
- This... Hang on, sir.
- Open the door!
- Where are you going?
- Open up!
- Excuse me.
- We've got a complaint...
- Who are you?
- Oh, really?
You're a con artist.
He has an effeminate voice.
You can't barge into my room.
- Get back!
- You can't barge into a girls' hostel!
- You can't go in.
- Sir.
- Where's the lady constable?
- Come on! Move it!
- This is a girls' hostel!
- Don't interfere in police work!
- Don't you know...
- I said don't interfere!
- Let go of me!
- Back off.
- We don't hit girls!
- Rashmi!
- You can't do that!
- Come on.
- Move it!
- Sir...
- Come on!
- Rashmi!
- Rashmi! Sir, you can't take her!
- Move it!
Come on!
- Sir, stop.
- Come on. Move it!
Let's go.
Rashmi! Rashmi!
Rashmi!
Rashmi!
Rashmi!
Let the string loose!
- I did. But you're standing on it.
- Rashmi!
Yes, sorry. Rashmi!
- Yes, okay.
- Don't let go.
- Or it will...
- It's flying fine.
Rashmi!
- Rashmi!
- Yes, Dad?
Dad's favourite! I was calling you.
Change your clothes.
Wear a nice frock, okay?
How about the blue pants?
My dear, wear anything
you feel like.
Frock or pants, you choose.
What's the matter with you?
She's a girl. She should wear a frock!
Set some boundaries for the girl.
I never set boundaries
even for her mother!
- Then why must I do it for my daughter, Bhanuben?
- Hmm.
- Don't act smart with me.
- Hey.
Someone ought to keep an eye on her.
You keep an eye on the kite,
or they will snap it's thread.
Yes!
Look. I wore both.
Wow!
- Look at her!
- Gosh! Rashmi!
- Kite down!
- Oh no!
I told you to focus.
- He'll get there first.
- He'll embarrass me again!
Don't worry, Bhanuben.
You won't be embarrassed.
Okay? Rashmi, you go.
His son left long ago.
How will she catch up with him?
How many times have I told you
Winning or Losing is immaterial.
Our job is to try.
That's like it! Rocket!
Hey! Are you a boy or a girl?
Hey!
Why are you running
in the middle of the road?
I've to save Bhanuben's honour.
Leave the house!
Take this.
Go! Get out!
I have school every day.
I won't fail if I go
on the trek one day.
Dad's favourite!
Go on your dad's trek only from now on!
Uneducated people are not welcome
in my home!
- Go!
- My dear.
Go to school tomorrow. Okay?
I'll take you on the trek
the next time I go.
Okay? Go, dear.
Hey!
You've spoilt her.
She never listens to me.
It's enough
that she listens to herself!
- Come on.
- Hey!
'Bhanuben Creations'
Is that a boy or a girl?
Greetings, Uncle.
- Is this the consignment for Rajkot?
- Yes, it ships out in the evening.
Hey, did you meet the collector?
The collector is a scoundrel.
He says he'll grant you
half an acre of land for the school.
How does one educate girls
in such a small space?
I told him the same thing.
He asked for the blueprint.
I told him not to invite
Bhanuben's wrath on himself!
Is the 'webstart' ready yet?
- Oh, Aunt! That's 'website' and not 'webstart'.
- Fine.
It was assigned to you two idlers.
Why isn't it ready?
I'm busy.
I'm doing a course in accounting.
Wait until I get my degree.
Degree?! I haven't even seen you two
making it past the driveway!
Not everyone needs to go to the city
to study like you.
It's an online course from Upgrad.
Your brother is smart!
You're oversmart!
I managed to get donations
from a few NGOs with great difficulty.
Please design the website quickly.
You're the eldest sibling.
Do one thing.
Install a good Internet connection
at home.
Rashmi, you are right.
My sons are good-for-nothing!
Buy one fool, get one free!
Bhanuben!
Sakhi's husband assaulted her again!
- Forgive me for my mistake.
- You have to apologise.
It's up to Sakhi,
whether she wants to forgive you.
Fine!
None of the women in the village
will work.
Neither at home nor for the business.
The work cannot stop. The Mahotsav
festival is around the corner.
Either your son must apologise
to his wife,
or he must leave the village.
Apologise!
Sorry.
Let's go.
I said let's go!
Sakhi's husband came to me
to bandage his wounds.
I knew it was you.
Rashmi, is violence
really necessary?
Exactly. That's what I'm also saying.
Ask him.
You can talk things over amicably.
If that were true,
no country in the world
would need an army.
Your mouth runs faster
than your legs!
- Victory to India!
- Welcome.
Meet him, Captain Siraj Siddique.
Captain Jolly Bakshi.
Captain Gagan Thakur.
He's a track and field trainer
with the army.
They two are here
to run the marathon.
Gagan trains them.
We fondly call her Rocket.
No one knows this area
better than her.
Rocket?
You can call me Rashmi.
Rashmi, give them a tour
of the marathon route tomorrow.
Okay.
- 5 am tomorrow.
- Yes, ma'am. Done.
That over there is the BSF posting.
- Let's take five, guys.
- Yes.
We have to cover another
35 km approximately.
Longer for us. Approximately 50 km.
- We're attempting the longest route.
- Why?
It's every athlete's dream.
- We can dream only if you let us sleep.
- Really?
Are you an athlete yourself?
I used to be one.
Don't be the embodiment of modesty!
- Embodiment! Rascal!
- Yes.
He has won a gold medal.
Really? At the nationals?
Then?
Then...
I suffered an injury,
and my career was over.
- Water?
- No, thanks.
Does he listen to music all day?
He's getting married.
Ayesha has made a playlist for him.
Their taste in music must match
by the end of the trip, or else...
It won't work.
How would we warn him
if a snake shows up?
Are there snakes here?
It's their turf, soldier.
We are guests here.
You're right.
- You didn't tell me yesterday.
- What?
Why do people call you Rocket?
It's a personal story.
I'll tell you if we become friends.
We don't have a lot of time.
We can't afford the luxury
of waiting.
Do tell me if there's a shortcut
to becoming your friend.
It'd be easier.
Are you an interstate bus?
You want to take the longer route,
and you don't have the patience!
You tell me.
Do you miss athletics?
You miss things that are no longer
a part of your life.
I'm a trainer.
I am invested in them.
Dr. Ijaz mentioned
that you are a tour guide.
What made you to choose
to become a tour guide?
That story is also personal.
I see.
Fine. Let's discuss
the weather then.
My dad was a tour guide.
- Oh no! Gagan!
- Landmine!
I am fine!
- What happened?
- Just wait.
She covered 80 metres
in ten seconds.
Faster than you!
It must have hurt your ego.
- Rascal! Focus.
- Yes.
- The girl is fast.
- What are you whispering?
Gagan says you're a fast girl.
Yes. I mean...
He means...
Rashmi, have you ever run a race?
Aren't two students enough?
I'm serious.
You should run professionally.
Right now, I should run home!
You ought to take me seriously.
I don't like serious conversations.
Call me if you ever want
to casually chit-chat.
She's been a fast runner
since her childhood.
That's why we call her Rocket.
But now...
She's running away from her reality.
I don't know why.
Fine! Then leave the house.
Here we go again!
What gets into you time and again?
What happened, sister?
Tell her that if she wants
to stay in this house,
- she must enter the competition.
- Rashmi...
Have our profits dipped this month?
- No! Who said that? Our profits...
- That's enough!
If she does not run,
then no one will talk to her.
Enough!
I won't run.
This rocket just fizzled!
- Sister
- Hey!
- Sister
- No!
Don't let her in!
And no one will talk to her!
Let's go, everyone.
- Get to work.
- Okay.
Rashmi.
I should run, shouldn't I?
- Oh no!
- I'll run.
- Rashmi. Listen, I can explain.
- Hey!
- Wait! Check out my speed!
- Sorry! Listen. I...
- Sorry!
- Fine, don't stop.
You're an athlete.
Let's see who wins the race.
Listen, I know I overstepped.
We don't have time.
The trials are tomorrow.
You wouldn't listen!
- I defeated you once. This time...
- Sorry!
Not just this time,
you'll defeat me every time.
I told you that you're fast.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have gone to your mom.
I'm really sorry.
But now...
I've met your family,
and we're becoming friends. So...
Tell me why you shy away
from running.
'Welcome to Republic Day, 2001'
'The time was 8:46 am,
and it was 26 January 2001.'
'The nation was celebrating
the Republic Day.'
'But Bhuj in western Gujarat was
struck by a massive earthquake'
'It was the most devastating
earthquake in India's history.'
'It destroyed Kutch and Gujarat.'
I was focused on the finish line.
I ran in the wrong direction.
I don't wish to lose anything again
to gain such a victory.
Not anymore.
It terrifies me.
So...
That's why I don't want to run.
Rashmi.
You saved a soldier's life.
You're a soldier to me.
Don't enter a race,
or win any medals.
But don't let your fear win.
Rashmi, come here.
The website for the girls' school
is ready.
Donations are pouring in.
I hope you won't call us
useless any more.
The logo was Bhanuben's idea.
Who let you in?
- Is this your father's house?
- It so happens to be.
I've heard your mother
kicked you out.
That's her way of expressing love.
When she wants to teach me a lesson,
she starts her theatrics!
So, what did you learn this time?
Who's getting married?
Why? Do you want to marry?
Yes, but I'm busy right now.
I have a race to run.
Okay.
You've come to your senses.
What can I do?
The pressure is too much.
Mom gets melodramatic, and dad
calls me a rocket. Asks me to soar.
So, I thought it's better to run.
- Listen, Bhanuben.
- Yes, tell me.
- You know my mother...
- Yes?
She looks after the entire village.
And when I leave to run the
participate in the competition,
you look after her.
- Okay?
- Hmm.
Okay.
- Don't overdo the affection or I'll change my mind.
- Yes!
Listen.
You decided on that logo
to make me sentimental, didn't you?
What time are the trials?
You're late.
You can't get in
at the last moment.
You have to register
well in advance.
I respect your rules
and regulations.
But just take a look.
It'll take only 13 seconds.
- I cannot allow everyone.
- Don't allow everyone.
Give Rashmi one chance, please.
Trust me. You won't regret it.
13 seconds isn't enough
to get selected in the try-out...
I'm aware, but she'll do it.
You're one confident man!
Fine, let's see.
Thank you.
Rashmi!
11.81!
This girl is a wonder!
Again?
Yes.
Excuse me.
What did you say her name was?
Rashmi is way ahead
of her competitors.
And she has made it
to the finish line.
She has won the race with ease.
The kids are rooting for Rashmi
by the name
- she's locally known as.
- Rocket! Rocket!
- Rocket! Hurrah!
- Hurrah!
- Hey...
- Run!
Rashmi Vira aka Rocket from Kutch
finishes the race in 11.72 seconds
and grabs the gold once again!
She broke the record!
Take this stance.
I don't need this.
The race begins,
and Rashmi takes the lead.
She has proved that
she is no ordinary athlete,
nor an accidental winner.
She's an accomplished runner.
This girl is fabulous.
I think we can all agree
that she should represent India.
Yes?
You don't agree, Dilip?
Well, the girl is good.
But...
To compete
at the international level,
apart from skill,
one needs a particular mindset too.
Which one gets
after years of training.
It doesn't come overnight.
Yes, Mr Chopra is right.
Look at the body language
of this girl before a race.
She doesn't know
the basics of racing.
But she broke all the state records
without any training.
- Even her blood reports are clean...
- Yes.
No signs of doping either.
Dilip, I admit training is important,
but the girl is gifted.
Her natural talents
cannot be ignored.
We are a nation
of 1.3 billion people!
There's talent
in every nook and corner!
But we cannot take them all
in the national squad!
See, the girl is gifted.
Fine, but...
A girl... Rather, she's an
untrained girl.
If we give in to our emotions
and select her,
who will answer to the public?
Will you?
Will you? I am not willing to.
With all due respect, sir.
Dilip, in 1951,
in the first Asian Games,
India won 15 gold medals.
We have not been able
to touch that number to this day.
I want to do everything that
would give us that chance again.
Yes, this is a radical decision.
But it isn't emotional.
It's an ambitious decision.
If Rashmi trains hard,
I'm convinced she can
bring us closer to our goal.
Let's all vote. Show of hands.
Aye.
- Rashmi.
- Yes?
Hi. Tejas Mukherji.
Head coach of
the track and field team.
- Oh.
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.
- Come. I'll introduce you to the girls.
- Yes.
- This is Assistant Coach Garima.
That's Khem down there.
She's Vaidehi.
That's Shatabdi and Anushree.
This is Fami.
Niharika back there.
That's Priyanka.
And girls!
This is Rashmi Vira.
The rising star of Gujarat.
Make her feel at home.
Garima, can I see you there, please?
Rocket, right?
- I'm Vaidehi.
- Hi.
I'm a big fan of yours.
What a runner you are!
You know what? I knew that
when you come here,
we'd become instant best friends.
In my head, we're already close.
- But...
- Let the star take a breath at least.
Come with me.
Niharika is the real star.
She's talented as well as connected.
What do you mean?
She's Dilip Chopra's daughter.
Is he a film star?
No. He's a senior selector.
That's why everyone
toadies up to her.
But she sure is talented.
She's your only competition.
All right, girls!
Get ready for warm up.
Come on in, girls.
Well done, Khem. Bravo.
Higher knees! Lift your knees!
Move it. Faster.
Rashmi, what are you waiting for?
Come on. Move.
Mark one.
Good. Good. Push.
Harder.
Come on. Quick! Quick...
Continue.
Higher! Come on!
Come on! It's not happening, Rashmi!
'23! 24!'
'25!'
Rashmi, head down.
Have you noticed an airplane?
It takes a low pick up. Okay?
That's the way you need to do it.
You'll go straight.
Alright? Okay?
Think of an airplane,
and that's it.
You need to go under it.
Alright? First five steps
to be really low.
No!
Lower. Take off.
Set.
15! 16!
17! Keep your core strong, everyone.
Fami, up.
Move. Move.
Set.
Rashmi, halfway on the pick up
in line with the shoulder.
Stride in. Stride in!
- Whoa!
- Good!
- Great timing, Rashmi.
- Thank you.
Well done.
But your start was poor.
You'll have to work
on that. Alright?
Yes.
Alright, girls. Out of your spikes.
Cool down.
Anushree.
No, I'm done.
Finish.
We need subtitles
whenever she speaks.
Right, Miss Trivandrum?
Aren't you from Bhuj?
Yes.
Do all the girls there
look like boys?
Priyanka, don't be rude.
She's bulky, that's why I asked.
If the place makes the difference,
then we'll go there too.
Or if you take steroids
that don't get detected
in blood tests, do tell us.
Then we can also break records.
Tell me?
I have my suspicions.
Because no girl has broken
the record till date.
Are you a boy?
Let's check.
You got offended.
I'm just trying
to get friendly. Okay?
- Just chill.
- Girls in my village
break the other person's jaw
when they try to get this friendly.
Will you break my jaw?
Priyanka, can you just let it go?
What?
I was joking.
I was also joking!
Rashmi.
Did you threaten to break
your teammate's jaw at in the canteen?
- Sir, she was rude.
- It's possible.
But is this how you will react
to being provoked?
Where's your mental strength?
50 rounds.
- But, sir, I...
- Listen. Don't argue with me, Rashmi.
This isn't your neighbourhood.
It's the national training ground.
Over here, discipline is everything.
They're clocking good timing, sir.
Alright, girls. Line up!
India has never won a gold
in the 4x100 metres relay.
China sends their B team,
but even they are
Olympic contenders.
But this time, with the speed
of our top four, we have a chance.
Alright?
So, let's do a practice run.
And remember, in this race,
teamwork is everything.
Come on, let's go.
Come on. Move...
Rashmi!
What are you doing?
Focus!
Clean pass is crucial, Rashmi.
- Once more.
- Set.
Niharika!
Made a mistake in the end...
Carry on. I'll join you soon.
Hello!
Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations. Well done.
- Thank you.
I was 0.3 seconds faster
than my previous best.
I wasn't talking about your speed.
I congratulated you
for the game you played out there.
Good morning, sir.
Rashmi passed the baton
to you properly.
These cheap tricks won't lead you
to a great victory, mind you.
So, beat Rashmi with your speed.
No one remembers a silver medallists.
So, next time, buck up.
Up.
Once again.
Your passes have been perfect
for an hour now, Rashmi.
- That's enough.
- Again.
One more time.
Up.
One more time.
Hello.
'Where are you?'
In hell. Where are you?
'I am in hell too.'
'Just one level above you.'
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I shouldn't have come here.
I thought this would be
really easy for me.
I was wrong.
These girls have been training
for years.
I don't belong...
Give it a few months.
If nothing changes,
tourists will still flock to Gujarat.
Do you like me?
- Yes.
- Sure?
No...
No, I often ride the motorbike my bike
for hours
just to have dinner
at in other people's canteens!
I'm serious.
Since when do you say
serious things?
Rashmi.
I obviously like you a lot.
Do you like me?
I see.
Why do you like me?
Your looks are above average.
- Hmm.
- Your personality is just okay.
Actually, I've always wanted
a soldier for a boyfriend.
My career helped me get a girl!
Why a soldier?
- Uniform?
- Of course.
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.
- You've met Vaidehi.
- Yes.
- That's Fami.
- Hi.
- That's Khem, Anushree and Shatabdi.
- Hi.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening.
That's Gagan.
He's a Captain with the army.
I was a Captain. I am a Major now.
Recently promoted
as Major Gagan Thakur.
- Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.
Good job, Rashmi.
'I welcome you
to the 2014 Asia Games.'
'It's an important day
for all of us.'
'The first event is
the women's 100 metres race.'
Victory to India, sir.
I'm glad I ran into you.
I want to show you something.
Not now. Rashmi's race is about
to begin. I can't miss it.
Sir, it won't take long.
It's important.
- Please, sir.
- You'll delay me. What is it?
'They've brought
their country flags.'
'Indonesia, Japan, China...'
Wow!
'The Indian flag is...'
This is wonderful.
- Sit. Let's watch.
- 'The Indian team'
'has arrived
and is led by their coach.'
'Right behind him
are Niharika and Rashmi.'
'Obviously, all eyes will be
on Rashmi and Niharika.'
'We all know that Niharika'
'is India's top athlete
in the 100 metres.'
We can expect her to get the gold.
But along with that,
they are up against champions
who will be tough competitors
to them.
And China tops the list.
All the athletes are
at the starting block.
All eyes are on Rashmi Vira,
Niharika Chopra
and Xiang Yhao from China.
Will she defeat the Indian athletes
or will Indians beat her
still remains to be seen.
That was the gunshot,
and the race begins.
A fantastic start
for Rashmi, Niharika and Xiang.
All three are dashing.
But Rashmi takes the lead.
Rashmi is very close
to the finish line!
- And Rashmi has made history!
- Yes!
Rashmi is a champion!
- Yes!
- 11.27 seconds!
Wow! What a champion she is!
She was literally
floating like anything!
Rashmi Vira is
an outstanding athlete!
She beat all the odds and challenges
to get here,
and she has proved herself.
- Celebratory sweets!
- Yes.
The women's 200 metres race begins
with the gunshot.
Xiang and Rashmi are neck and neck.
They're close. It seems like
it will be a photo finish.
We will soon get to know
who out of them is the champion.
- It is Rashmi...
- 'Both the athletes running with gusto.'
'Who has won this race?'
'It hasn't been decided yet.'
'Xiang, Rashmi and all
the spectators in the stadium'
'are glued to the big screen.'
'It is very close.'
'Gold, China. Silver, India...'
That's good.
- Good!
- Fantastic performance!
I told you.
You got to beat the hell out of them.
Okay?
- Yes.
- Come on.
Niharika.
- Yes, sir.
- Can I speak to you for a minute?
- Sure, sir.
- Rashmi, just a minute.
Rest of you, keep moving.
Alright, guys.
I was thinking about something.
Rashmi, you're in top form.
I think you should go fourth
in tomorrow's relay.
You know, for a strong finish.
Niharika, you'll go third. Okay?
Sure, sir.
All right Alright? Cool.
- Sir.
- Yes?
Let's go with how we've practised.
The team is set.
Let Niharika finish.
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
Let's go.
There goes the gunshot,
and the race begins.
India's Priyanka and
China's Liu Chang Feng
- are off to a good start as expected.
- Yes!
- Look over there.
- 'Japan and Philippines are behind them.'
All the athletes are picking up speed.
Oh my God! That's a blunder!
'It's a real blunder.'
'The race will get tougher
for the Indians.'
'Losing your balance at this point'
'might mean throwing your team
out of the race.'
But Khem Kumari is not giving up.
She is trying to pick up speed.
But, Sudhir, many athletes
have left her behind.
The baton will be now passed
to Rashmi Vira.
Rashmi Vira is
India's biggest hope.
- She's off to a fantastic start.
- 'Wow!'
She's off like a thunderbolt
the moment she took the baton.
Rashmi's speed is unimaginable.
The crowd goes is going berserk.
- Rashmi Vira is running like the wind.
- Come on, Rashmi!
She has overtaken four runners.
We're at the last stage of the race.
Another 100 metres to go.
Niharika gets the baton,
and she dashes ahead.
Rashmi handed the baton to Niharika
with perfection.
Niharika giving it her all.
Niharika is in the lead.
A few metres to the finish line.
Niharika close to the finish line!
And Niharika gets a gold for India!
- Rocket! Rocket!
- Rocket! Rocket!
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket!
- Rocket!
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rocket! Rocket...
- Rashmi Vira.
- Yes?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
you have to come with me.
Why?
I'll brief you on the way.
Don't be alarmed.
I'm from the association.
Oh! I think they're awarding you
with an extra medal
for winning three medals.
- Take my bag. I'll see you soon.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Okay. See you.
Why have you brought me here?
Take off your jacket.
- What's this?
- You have to undergo a blood test.
Please remove the jacket.
If you wanted to perform
a blood test,
you could have taken my sample
at the hostel.
The association has
certain protocols.
Please cooperate.
It's just a simple blood test.
Take off your jacket, please.
Sit.
- What's this?
- It's a form.
I can see that.
But what does it say?
The form states that you consent
to the test.
But no one took my consent.
And why just my test?
Ma'am, the more questions you ask
the longer this will take.
If I explain our rules
and regulations to you,
we'll be here all day.
Sign here.
- I'll be back.
- How much longer?
She's Dr. Mhatre.
She'll ask you some questions.
Hello, Rashmi.
I want to clear some basics.
When did you last have your period?
What does that have to do
with the test?
Answer, please.
6 or 7 weeks ago.
- Is it normal?
- How would I know? You're the doctor.
Prepare for an ultrasound.
- Why is an ultrasound needed?
- It's the protocol.
It has to be followed
for some female athletes.
Some female athletes...
Can you tell me what's going on?
Look, Rashmi.
You won three medals.
That's no mean feat.
We only want to ensure
no questions are raised on
your performance in the Asia Games.
That's all there is to it.
One! Two! One! Two...
One! Two! One! Two...
- One! Two! One! Two...
- Higher!
One! Two...
We're ready for you.
Come on.
Leave your phone here.
It's not allowed inside.
Go inside and take off
all your clothes.
All my clothes?
Who takes off all their clothes
for an ultrasound?
Is this a joke?
I don't want to undergo any test!
I've had enough!
Listen.
My mother has never forced me
to do anything.
So you don't even think about it!
Fine, you may go.
But I won't give you a clean chit.
The association won't consider you
for any competitive races in the future.
And the three medals you have won
might also be revoked.
- So, you mean...
- My report will state
that Rashmi was uncooperative.
So, the test couldn't be completed.
It's your call.
Excuse me.
I'm hungry. Can I eat?
There's one blood test left
on an empty stomach.
My phone...
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the camp.
Are you home, champ?
Rashmi, are you okay?
Rashmi, where have you been?
I've been calling you.
Are you okay?
Tell everyone what happened.
What happened?
Everyone was bound to find out
the truth about her sooner or later.
What truth?
The gender test proved
that she's a boy.
Don't talk rubbish, Priyanka.
Ask him how he won so many medals.
He took unfair advantage
by participating in women's race.
He's a boy, and not a girl.
It's cheating.
I've been telling you
from the beginning
- that he's a boy.
- You know everything!
You know everything, right?
- Don't you?
- Rashmi, chill!
- I'll show you!
- Rashmi, just leave her!
- What the hell!
- Done?
I cheated!
- Did I cheat?
- Stop!
Rashmi. Rashmi!
- Cheating...
- Rashmi, leave her!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Go back to your room right now!
You're finished, Rashmi.
That's how...
Hello.
- You can't barge in.
- Gagan, it was him.
Where's Rashmi Vira?
- Who are you?
- Major Gagan Thakur.
Where is Rashmi Vira?
Ma'am! Where do you think you're going?
Wait outside!
- Show me the arrest report.
- Why?
You arrested Rashmi Vira
without a warrant.
Where's the report
establishing probable cause?
I'm not obliged to show it to you.
You barged into a girls' hostel
without a lady constable.
You broke all the protocols
and assaulted a celebrated athlete.
We had orders from the top.
Oh, really!
I know all about your orders!
- If I make an official complaint, you'll lose your jobs!
- Gagan!
Get her out! Now!
Rashmi, why did
male police officers arrest you?
- Was there a gender test conducted?
- Rashmi...
Are you really a male?
Have you cheated this nation?
Rashmi Vira,
are you nation's biggest fraud?
Get down here for
Jaisalpur, Manpur, Bhuj.
Get down here for Bhuj.
She would hang out with the boys,
get into fights with boys.
That's all she did.
This morning,
the association declared
that they are banning Rashmi Vira
from competing in any national
or international event.
Rashmi has failed the gender test.
- Leave!
- '... has failed the gender test.'
The villagers say that Rashmi Vira
was manly since childhood.
She was different
from the rest of the girls.
Is the queen of Indian athletes
a king in reality?
We've come to her hometown
to find that out.
- Let's find out from Rashmi's...
- Don't talk rubbish!
You don't know facts.
Will you feed trash to the public?
- This is live...
- What is a gender test?
Tell me. What does it have
to do with masculinity?
- Cut!
- I'll beat you up if you do.
Let the audience find out
about your rubbish
and insensitive reporting.
An athlete is suffering injustice,
and you're making jokes
on about kings and queens!
And if you watch this channel,
then I advise you to stop.
This isn't journalism.
What rubbish!
Am I talking rubbish?
You... What do you call
what you did?
You call yourself a journalist!
Come at me! I dare you!
Thanks.
My name is Eeshit.
I'm an advocate.
The association has wronged Rashmi.
I wish to file a case in
the High Court on Rashmi's behalf.
We will fight against
the association.
I don't want to file a case.
Rashmi.
At least hear him out.
Rashmi, they are questioning
the fact that you're a woman.
They don't realise
that the gender test
is just a scientific test
that measures the testosterone
levels in the body.
- It doesn't determine the gender of a person.
- Thank you so much.
- I don't want to file a case.
- Rashmi, just wait.
Look. She's Vanita Kumari.
She was 19 when she was selected
from a small village in Tamil Nadu.
The village held
a month-long celebration.
After she failed the gender test,
she wasn't even allowed
to enter the same village.
She took her life.
I wanted to fight for Vanita.
And for all those athletes like her
who have lost everything
to this test.
Vanita gave up
before even going to court.
Suman Parmar. Not a woman.
Charged with rape.
Kavita Gopalkrishnan.
Stripped of her medals,
goes into depression.
Vanita Kumari.
Evicted from her village
because of a failed gender test,
commits suicide.
And now, Rashmi Rocket.
From international fame
to national shame.
After Vanita's downfall,
my ex-boss Mangesh Desai fired me.
He represents the association now.
I know all their tactics.
Please say yes.
I'll take the association down
by their b...
I'll teach them a lesson.
Let me know when you're done here.
Rashmi. Rashmi!
Aunt!
Aunt, please talk to her.
What have you decided?
Rashmi.
What do you want to do?
Nothing.
Rashmi, I read the lawyer's files.
The association has ruined the lives
of many girls
in the name of gender testing.
What can I do?
What do you mean?
Since when do you think
only about yourself?
Had I only thought about me
after the earthquake struck us,
what would've become
of the women in the village?
You are great, Bhanuben.
Fine.
Leave this house.
- Let it be, sister.
- No.
You were everyone's hero.
And look at you now.
It's best that you leave.
I don't want the women
of this village
to become like you.
You mean masculine!
Weak!
I didn't realise that by
becoming a runner,
when you eventually decided
to run away from a fight.
Fine, I'll leave for good this time.
Rashmi.
Had I thought only about myself,
I'd have stayed here with you.
I was happy.
I didn't want to become an athlete.
You people called me a rocket
and asked me to run.
What did I get?
Nothing but insult!
Do you hear the kind of names
they're calling me?
I stayed away from home
and practised day and night, Mom!
I worked so hard that
I changed myself! What did I get?
Who was it all for?
The country I won medals for
pulled the rug from under my feet,
and the rocket you and dad
were proud of has crashed, Bhanuben!
Please spare me! I've had enough!
Rashmi...
- Wait, Rashmi.
- No.
We won't stop her.
We never stopped her before,
nor will we now.
Rashmi.
What's your intention?
I... This...
Will you marry me, or do you wish
to be in this live-in relationship?
I was thinking about
our relationship.
For a relationship to work,
both people must be
on the same page.
There's you and me,
but a deep chasm separates us.
Something inside me is gone.
I can't seem to do
anything about it.
- I am trying...
- I know.
But shall we try together?
Since I'm in this relationship,
might as well take advantage.
'Join me for dinner?'
Are you alright?
What's your intention?
Will you marry me, or do you wish
to be in a live-in relationship?
Sister, how long will this war go on?
- Hello. Yes, Eeshit here.
- Hello!
Eeshit, how many times
have I told you...
Tune in to India TV right now.
'Is the South Asia Championship
squad ready?'
'The national trials
are in four months.'
'The squad will be declared
after that.'
'Only the top four from
the competition will go through.'
'I'm sure Niharika Chopra
is confirmed.'
'She's the captain after all.'
'Ma'am, I'll be selected like
any other athlete in the country'
'via participation at the trials.'
'Can we hope to break records
without Rashmi Vira?'
'Her contribution to the Asia Games
was significant.'
'There are other talented runners
in our team, sir.'
'Faster than Rashmi?'
'I'm sure you stood to benefit
from Rashmi's ban.'
'The country has benefited.'
'At least we don't have a fraud
in our team anymore.'
'Thank you. That'll be all.
No more questions.'
'And one last thing. Next...'
They're mistaking my silence
for my weakness.
Just because I'm not fighting
doesn't mean I can't.
- Then should Eeshit be...
- No.
Actually, I don't know.
It's actually a big decision
questioning the association...
I... I'm not sure it would be wise.
It's always wise to run away
from a landmine.
But it was important
to run towards the landmine too.
'Rashmi Vira, the gold medallist, '
'was banned after she failed
the gender test.'
'Exactly after four months, here she
is at the Bombay High Court'
'and has filed a human rights
violation petition against'
'the Indian Athletics Association.'
- Bhanuben!
- 'This is a first...'
- Bhanuben!
- 'For Indian sports.'
Rashmi has filed a case
against the association.
Nilesh, this is war!
It has just begun.
'Finally, someone is doing
the right thing.'
'I have always been
against gender testing.'
'It is absolutely regressive
and demeaning.'
'The world has advanced
leaps and bounds, '
'but India is still living
in medieval times.'
'Take for instance
our reporting quality.'
'Is Rashmi a man?
Is she a fraudster?'
'No. But are you stupid?
100 percent.'
'Rashmi is a
once-in-a-generation athlete.'
'The Association ought
to support her.'
- 'You and I should support her.
- Absolutely.'
'Rashmi is genuinely a rocket.'
'And for God's sake, let her soar.'
We don't need to worry at all.
It was all done officially.
She signed the consent form
of her own accord, right?
The paperwork is complete too.
By the way, who is
Rashmi Vira's lawyer?
Sir, it's Eeshit.
Mangesh Desai's overconfidence
will be his downfall.
He'll follow the rule book and say
the test is internationally accepted.
And that we must fight
international policies.
International policies aside,
I am questioning
what ensued with me here.
I'm a citizen of this country first,
Eeshit.
I've won medals for this country.
I want justice here.
I'll fight the entire world
after that.
The circumstances
of Rashmi Vira's arrest
could be problematic for us.
Male cops arrested her.
They'll make an issue of it.
They should.
It was wrong.
Do we know who called the police?
We're working on that, sir.
- Who is the judge?
- Savita Deshpande.
Would it help
that she's a lady judge?
Savita is objective.
The feminism angle
doesn't work on her.
Hard facts only.
Eeshit is inexperienced
as well as impulsive.
Don't worry.
This case won't even reach
the trial stage.
This is a pre-trial hearing.
No witnesses will be called.
I will listen to the prosecution
and defence arguments
and examine
the preliminary evidence.
Prosecution may proceed.
Eeshit.
- Ma'am, on 5th Oct...
- Your Honour!
Please address me as Your Honour,
if possible.
Sorry.
Your Honour, on 5th October,
Rashmi Vira won
3 medals for India and reached Pune.
She's taken to a medical facility
approved by the Association
where she was told she'd undergo
routine medical check-ups.
But she is kept there for six hours.
And they perform a gender test
on her without her knowledge.
Rashmi Vira signed a consent form
for the test.
The test wasn't conducted
without her knowledge and consent.
Is this Rashmi Vira's signature?
Yes, Your Honour,
but she didn't know what it was for.
- Is Rashmi Vira uneducated?
- No, Your Honour.
They took advantage
of her exhaustion and confusion.
Your Honour, the protocols
of the gender test
have been set by
the International Athletics Council,
and not by us.
And the Association simply follows
those rules.
Please take a look.
It clearly states, if the results
of the gender test reveal
that the testosterone level
in the blood is more than
10 nanomoles per litre,
then the athlete must be banned.
And in Rashmi Vira's case,
this level was a little over
11 nanomoles per litre.
Eeshit, everything is
by the rule book.
The Association has the right
to ban Rashmi Vira.
- There's no case!
- There is, Your Honour.
If this case is tried, then I can
prove that testosterone levels
have no impact on the performance
of female athletes.
So, you want me to have faith
in you and rule for a trial?
Your Honour,
Rashmi Vira's case
isn't limited to testosterone levels
or the Association's ban.
It is also about
human rights violations.
- What rubbish!
- Mr. Desai.
Sorry.
You may continue.
Your Honour, I'm talking about
basic human rights.
Medical tests are performed on you
for six hours without informing you.
You're asked to strip
and take an ultrasound
without any explanation.
What law gives us the right
to question a person's confidence
and abilities?
On top of it, our great media
raises doubts about a national hero
being a woman!
Eeshit, it is not
the Association's responsibility
- how the media portrays the news.
- Why?
- Why not, sir?
- It's another debate altogether.
No, sir. It's a part of this debate.
When athletes win medals
for the country,
the same Association
invites the media for tea
and has them print
one article after another.
And when the same media
targets athletes,
won't you take the responsibility
for their gross irresponsibility?
That's convenient, ma'am...
Your Honour.
A few hours after the gender test,
male police officers force their way
onto the Association's property
and illegally arrest Rashmi Vira.
Why? Because they think
she's not a woman.
But how did the police know
about the gender test?
Your Honour, these questions
point to a conspiracy.
- The arrest took place because Rashmi Vira...
- This fight isn't
just over a ban, Your Honour.
This fight is about all those women
who lost everything
to a meaningless test!
Those athletes
and this country's daughters
can hope for this court
to give them a fair trial.
So, I request this court
to reassess the validity
and need of this test
that strips a person
of his or her fundamental rights.
Eeshit, do you watch
a lot of Bollywood movies?
- Excuse me?
- No.
You don't see such high drama
in courtrooms in reality.
Your speech wasn't bad though.
But, on 5 October 2014,
the Association didn't break
any laws by conducting a gender test
on Rashmi Vira.
But does the gender test
violate basic human rights?
And why did the police
arrest Rashmi Vira
on the Association grounds that day?
Keeping these two things in mind,
I would like this case
to be tried in court.
- The next proceeding will take place after six months.
- Your Honour!
- Six months is too long.
- Excuse me?
The trials for the South Asia
Championship are in four months.
If the Association's ban
on Rashmi Vira is lifted,
she might win medals
for the country.
I request this case be fast-tracked.
Eeshit, first, have the ban
lifted off at least.
- Then you can dream of medals.
- Eeshit.
You're getting dramatic and playing
the nationalism card again.
I don't understand whether I should
be irritated or impressed with you!
I am confused.
Anyway...
Mr. Mehta, I can give you
a concession on the next hearing date.
The next hearing will be
in 12 days.
Thank you, ma'am... Your Honour.
Thank you!
Come on.
We've got permission to train here.
You can come here anytime.
How?
The perks of knowing me.
Are you ready to get back
in the field again?
What if we lose the case?
We won't stop fighting.
Okay?
Was it you who took my client
to the clinic?
- Yes.
- Did you tell her why?
Yes, I told her that it was
for a medical test.
What test was it, ma'am?
Was it a dope test, fitness test
or blood test? What exactly?
She did not ask.
But she signed a consent form
for a gender test at the clinic.
Of course.
Even if we catch their lies,
they'll talk about the consent form
repeatedly.
I was stressed out at the time.
I signed wherever they asked
under their pressure.
Tell me the sequence of events.
What happened after you signed
the form?
After I signed the form,
Dr. Mhatre showed up.
Dr. Mhatre.
Who instructed you
to conduct the gender test?
I received an email
from the Association's official ID.
Sure, but the authorisation must've
come from an Association member.
So, who gave you the authorisation
to conduct gender test on my client?
Mr. Dilip Chopra.
Dr. Mhatre, before Rashmi Vira's test,
how many gender tests
have you performed?
- None.
- What!
Wow! Really?
Objection. Asked and answered.
Sorry, sir. Not even one!
Okay. Then how do you know
how to conduct a gender test?
Objection.
Dr. Mhatre is an Association-approved
medical expert.
Yes, but an eye specialist
wouldn't perform
a heart transplant, right Mangesh?
Please answer, Dr. Mhatre.
All the doctors approved
by the Association
know how to conduct a gender test.
- And we have a detailed manual to go by.
- Right.
Is this the manual?
Yes.
So, doctor, a gender test determines
- the level of testosterone in the blood. Right?
- Yes.
So, a blood test should be enough
to determine testosterone levels.
- Right?
- Usually, yes.
Can you please explain to this court
why you had Rashmi Vira strip
and performed an ultrasound on her?
- It's mentioned in the manual...
- No!
There is no mention of an ultrasound
to gauge testosterone levels in it!
Unless you doubt
that Rashmi Vira is not female.
She's either a male or a transgender.
Did you have that doubt?
- Look. Manual...
- Doctor, you're not answering my question!
Did you have a doubt, or did someone
plant a seed of doubt in your mind
- that Rashmi Vira is not a woman?
- Objection!
Badgering the witness.
Just asking questions, Your Honour.
Sustained. Careful, Mr. Mehta.
Mangesh Desai has convinced
the judge
that the witnesses must
be presented chronologically.
- What do you mean?
- I can't call the inspectors after the doctor.
First, I'll have to deal with
the assault incident that night.
It can get tricky.
Tricky how?
Rashmi, they'll talk about
your anger and your violent streak.
They'll waste time.
- My violent streak?
- Yes.
I'm violent!
Really?
No.
No way.
Not anymore.
Dr. Ijaz mentioned she beat up guys
in the village a long time ago.
A long time ago, not recently.
- We need details from him.
- Yes.
- She chased after me to hit me once.
- No.
- Don't say that in court.
- No way.
You were flirting with me.
- And...
- Okay, fine.
Okay, I'll deal with it.
Rashmi is an exceptional athlete.
One of the best.
Physically very tough,
but lacks mental strength.
She has no control over her anger.
Was she always angry
with her teammates?
It takes time
for any new athlete to settle.
Rashmi also took her time.
But she was mostly friendly
with everyone.
Not at all.
She'd generally be in a bad mood.
She'd act all rowdy at the hostel.
Did you do this?
Don't look at him. Answer me.
I showed concern that night
because she was out late.
But she flipped.
Priyanka is lying.
She provoked her all the time.
She used to call her a boy.
Teasing and ragging are normal,
but violence is not.
So, what are your feelings
about my client, Rashmi Vira?
I respected her.
Her performance was good.
But off the field,
she has anger management issues.
Yes, all of you mentioned it.
But the Association did not ban
Rashmi Vira for violence.
You were the number one athlete
before she arrived.
Then your father ordered
a gender test on her.
Don't you think
your father helped you out?
Objection!
No, I'll answer that.
No.
I never felt that,
because I win medals
on the race track with my talent.
Not with my dad's help.
And no one can take that from me.
And for your information,
I have been the fastest sprinter
in the country for a long time now.
Second fastest.
Rashmi Vira is India's fastest
female athlete.
But she should have never qualified.
My talent is natural.
And I don't need
higher testosterone to win.
I think Niharika has summarised
the case in one line, Your Honour.
Sir, you may praise her
after I'm done questioning.
So, Niharika,
did you call the police that night?
- No.
- Sure?
Right, Sir.
Victory to India!
What are you doing?
I'm writing all the details
I can remember about 5th October.
It might help Eeshit.
It was Dr. Ijaz's call.
He wanted a running commentary!
Doctor.
There's someone here to meet you.
Greetings.
- Bhanuben!
- Yes.
You should have called me.
- Is everything alright?
- Yes.
I was in the vicinity,
and so I thought I'd drop by.
I am glad you did.
Please sit. What would you like?
- No... No.
- Listen...
Well...
Okay... I'll get going then. Bye.
If you stayed a while,
we could discuss Rashmi's case.
Have you spoken to her?
Please sit. I'll tell you in detail.
Okay.
Mr. Sathe, why did you arrest
Rashmi Vira on 5th October?
I received a call.
That a boy had broken into a girls'
hostel and was assaulting girls.
The safety of girls is our priority.
Who had called you?
Someone from the hostel
called on the helpline.
Yes, but there is no record of it
in the call records.
We don't ask questions on duty.
We received an update
on the wireless
that a fight had broken out
in the girls' hostel.
We went there immediately.
Yes, you got there immediately
and took a boy into custody.
Yes.
Was it this boy?
According to the information
we received...
You went there,
you illegally arrested Rashmi Vira
and beat her up.
- Didn't you hit her?
- It's common with arrests.
What is common, Sathe?
Well...
I mean...
Please continue, Mr. Mehta.
Mr. Sathe.
When you arrested Rashmi,
from what angle did she appear
to be a man?
It's hard to tell the difference
these days.
- You can't be sure.
- Yes.
Major Gagan said in his statement
that you didn't show
the arrest report to him.
You told him you received
the order from the higher up.
- No.
- Is the Major lying then?
I don't know.
I got the information
on the wireless.
- The FIR was lodged.
- Yes, it was. I have the FIR.
So, the FIR states that a boy
broke into the girls' hostel.
- Correct?
- Correct.
There's no mention of the fight.
- What?
- You had said
that you got a call that a boy broke
into the hostel and assaulted girls.
This states the boy merely broke in
and was hiding.
How did you miss out
on mentioning the assault?
Or did the call come from the higher ups
and not on the wireless?
You are lying, inspector.
Objection, Your Honour.
Where is this going?
Mr. Mehta.
The police's arrest and treatment
of Rashmi Vira were wrong.
A thorough investigation
will be conducted on their actions
and strict action will be taken
against them.
But you have not presented
any evidence of a conspiracy yet.
Your Honour, I'd like to call
my next witness in that context.
Please get on with it.
Your Honour, I would like
to call Mr. Dilip Chopra
to the witness stand.
Sir, please tell this court
since when you've been
a core member
of the Association's committee.
Six years approximately.
Six years. It means you were
a member of the Association
back then also when Vanita Kumari
underwent this test
and committed suicide.
Were you? No...
Yes, I was.
But then I must tell you,
Your Honour,
that even the State Association
conducts gender tests.
And the case he mentioned...
- I had no direct involvement in it.
- That's not what I was getting at.
Didn't the Association find
Vanita's suicide alarming?
Didn't anyone find the need to change
their approach towards this test?
- Anything at all.
- We did have discussions.
But then...
Look, these are
internationally approved laws.
We don't make them,
nor can we change them.
Moreover, if there was a personal
reason behind her committing suicide,
we can't get into that, can we?
Great, sir.
That's a good way to put it.
So, you don't think
there was a connection.
It's a tough spot, Mr. Mehta.
Apart from physical strength,
one needs mental strength too.
- And I've seen the best breaking.
- Sir, with due respect,
don't you think
it is your responsibility
to boost the morale of our players?
We try our best, Mr. Mehta.
But we can't go beyond a point.
What can we do?
Sir, tell me. Was the order
for Rashmi Vira's gender test...
I mean, permission.
Was it granted by you?
Yes.
It was me.
Your Honour, the tournament
officials had their doubts
about Rashmi's speed.
The answers to their questions
had to be backed
by documentation and evidence.
- I had to answer their questions.
- Oh! You were obligated!
- Binding.
- No, same thing.
- You were obligated to...
- Official binding.
- You were obliged to order Rashmi's gender test.
- Official binding.
- No, that's called official binding.
- Same thing, sir.
- Official binding.
- Yes, but you were obliged...
- Official binding.
- Objection, Your Honour! Objection.
Come to the point, Mr. Mehta.
Sir, on the night of 5th October,
did you call the police and say
that a boy had barged into
the girls' hostel and got violent?
No.
- So, you had no hand in Rashmi's arrest.
- Asked and answered!
Tell me something, sir.
It takes a day or two to get
the gender test results. Correct?
So, that night,
how come the media was discussing
Rashmi's gender already?
- That's a senseless question!
- No, it's valid.
You must have leaked
the information.
You must have told someone.
You know a lot of journalists.
You're a big shot.
- Objection!
- No... Sir, I...
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't, sir!
Sir, I'll tell you what you did.
To ensure a bright future
for your daughter Niharika,
you ended Rashmi's career
and her credibility.
You know perfectly well
that Rashmi is more talented
and faster than your daughter.
The prosecution is crossing a line!
This case has nothing to do
with my daughter's abilities.
So, I'd appreciate it if you don't
question her track record.
You suspect I am the culprit.
Present the evidence,
and I shall resign.
- That should be fair. Alright?
- We can have you resign!
- Get evidence.
- How will it work if you resign?
Wrap it up, Mr. Mehta. What is this?
- No more questions, Your Honour.
- Thank you.
Your Honour,
the prosecution has failed
to prove any of its theories.
Nothing significant has surfaced
that would question
Rashmi Vira's ban.
I believe he is wasting
the court's time.
I agree with the defence.
Mr. Mehta, as per the rule book,
the Association's ban is justified.
As for the testosterone levels,
you claimed that you would prove
that it has no impact
on performance.
I suggest that you focus
on this point in the next session.
The next hearing will be
after four weeks.
When you get tired of losing cases,
you can come back.
We always need interns.
Are you alright?
I don't know.
It hurts a little.
You should rest.
You can train tomorrow.
No. I don't have time, Gagan.
The judgement will be out
in a month. I have to be ready.
- Rashmi.
- Rashmi, are you okay?
It's confirmed. You're pregnant.
But, doctor,
ever since we started training,
we've been very careful.
She's three months pregnant.
What!
When there's an imbalance
of testosterone in the body,
the signs of pregnancy
show much later on.
By the way, this is usually
considered good news.
Yes. No, we are happy.
And we are thrilled,
but training-wise...
There's no need to worry.
You can continue with your training.
Pregnancy does not require one
to give up their lifestyle.
Yes, but how can I run
if I'm pregnant?
Have you heard of Sheryl Swoopes?
She's an Olympic medallist
in basketball.
In 1997, she played an entire season
whilst being pregnant.
Yes. It involves risks,
but it is not impossible.
The doctor said it is possible.
She also said it's risky.
Taking risks is our hobby.
True.
We will take every precaution.
But you have to listen.
To whom?
Hello?
Mom.
Won't you call me Bhanuben?
Do you need your mother?
Yes.
Because...
I...
I am going to be a mother.
'But don't worry.'
I will surely run the race.
I don't listen to anyone. Right?
But you listen to yourself.
That's a big deal.
Besides, the women from Kutch
work till their last breath.
If you don't run,
I will throw you out of the house.
Greetings.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Gagan!
- Thank you.
Sorry, I missed your call.
It's all right. I called to ask you
that if we win the case,
can the Association prevent Rashmi
from taking part in the trials
owing to her pregnancy?
I dare them!
I'll file another case against
those sons of... A gun!
Against the Association.
You look really excited.
Of course, I am. You are pregnant.
It's the beginning of a new chapter.
And we can use this.
For the case.
You mean, you can now prove
that I am a woman.
Eeshit, you had said
this wasn't just about me.
What about the rest of the girls?
Vanita Kumari and the others.
Since they were not pregnant,
whatever happened to them
was right!
Rashmi, we are losing the case.
Victory or defeat is merely
an outcome.
Our job is to try.
We're fighting for what's right.
That's enough.
'I've always been against gender testing'
'and this is absolutely regressive and...'
Your Honour, I'd again like to call
Inspector Sathe to the witness stand.
I object, Your Honour.
What will you achieve by questioning
Sathe again, Mr. Mehta?
Your Honour, you said that
the prosecution was not able
to prove a connection between
the Association and Rashmi's arrest.
I wish to present evidence
in that context.
Let me caution you here, Mr. Mehta.
If your evidence is not strong,
your case will take a hit.
Are you sure?
Yes, Your Honour. I'm sure.
Please go ahead.
Mr. Sathe, how many phones is
an officer on duty allowed to have?
Just one.
It's the one provided
by the department.
An official phone.
And what would I find
if I were to check the call records
of your official phone
for the evening of 5th October?
Nothing.
Sure?
You're right.
There's nothing.
But you received a call at 7:30 pm.
It was my wife's call.
She calls me to ask
what she should make for dinner.
Yes, I thought so.
That's why I checked
her call records as well.
Take a look.
She gets maximum calls
from these two numbers.
The first is your official number.
And this is the second one.
Whose is it?
How would you know?
Let me dial it and see.
- Your Honour...
- I want to see where he's taking this.
Thank you.
Yes, it's ringing.
It's your phone!
Show it to me.
Come on, Mr. Sathe.
Your Honour, this is
Inspector Sathe's personal phone.
It took me a while
to get the details
because it's not registered
to his name.
It's registered to his wife Nirmala.
The call records of this number
tell a different story, Your Honour.
Now, tell me, Mr. Sathe.
Did you get a call on the wireless
that night?
Good.
Did you get the call
on this number?
Is the caller present in the court?
Please point out.
Go on.
- What nonsense!
- Hey.
Don't speak from your seat.
Come to the witness box, please.
Rashmi mercilessly beat me up
in front of the whole team.
After that, you called up
Inspector Sathe and complained.
- No.
- Then?
I called up Uncle Dilip first...
I called Mr. Chopra first
and told him that Rashmi beat up
Niharika and me in a fit of rage.
Uncle Dilip... You mean Mr. Chopra
asked you to call Inspector Sathe
and call him there.
Yes.
Why did you lie in your complaint
that a boy broke into
the girls' hostel?
Uncle Dilip asked me
to say that.
One last question, Priyanka.
Had Dilip Chopra informed you
about Rashmi's gender test
on the phone beforehand?
Your Honour, Dilip Chopra's
call records establish this fact.
The defence will have to examine
the evidence, Your Honour.
As you should.
One more thing.
Dilip Chopra is merely a part
of the Association.
Not the Association per se.
His personal issues with Rashmi
have nothing to do
with Rashmi's ban in any way.
It was simply
a high testosterone level.
Yes, sir. I know,
which brings me to my next witness,
Your Honour.
Gender testing has been banned
across many sports.
Testosterone levels are
still checked in athletics,
but the athletic community
is not happy about it.
Athletes and associations in
many countries have questioned it.
- And the Indian Association?
- No.
Not yet.
Dr. Bhasin, what is your take
on gender testing?
In the last 20 years,
many reputed scientists have
conducted experiments and concluded
that higher testosterone
does not imply
there will be an impact on
the performance of female athletes.
The details are in my report.
The fact is that female athletes
face many hurdles
due to higher testosterone.
They get irregular periods
and see an increase in body hair.
There are many side effects.
Thank you, doctor.
Your witness.
Ma'am.
Can we say that since many years,
you've been against not just
gender testing
but also the Association?
Objection! Mr. Desai is trying
to establish a bias!
Sustained.
I would like to answer it.
Mr. Desai, I am biased.
I'm not against the Association,
but I'm on the side
of the female athletes.
The entire system is against them.
Someone ought to be on their side.
In fact, the Association is biased
towards male athletes.
They are given better facilities,
better pay and better sponsorships.
They aren't questioned as much.
But we're talking about science.
And science supports Rashmi.
Any more questions, Mr. Desai?
No, Your Honour.
Your Honour.
The defence would like to recall
its witness, Mr. Tejas Mukherji.
Your honour, the prosecution
presented an expert on gender testing.
We, too, would like to present
our expert.
Your Honour, Tejas Mukherji
is just a coach.
Ma'am, I also have
a PhD in Sports Performance
from Swansea University, UK.
So, if you please...
Do your research next time.
Coach Mukherji.
Can you tell us why gender tests
are important?
Sure.
Ma'am, scientifically,
an average female body
has 3.3 nanomoles of testosterone.
And an average male body
will have over 10 nanomoles.
If a female athlete with over
10 nanomoles testosterone
competes with regular
female athletes,
then it's not a level playing field.
Hence the separate categories
for male and female sport.
Had this differentiation
not existed,
then they'd have competed
against each other.
So, in your opinion,
a gender test is crucial,
- be it any sport.
- Yes.
What's the stand of
the International Athletic Council?
Well, they have absolutely
a zero-tolerance policy
towards higher testosterone.
An immediate ban was put on players
with levels higher than 10 nmol/L.
Thank you, coach. Your witness.
Mr. Mehta.
Can we expect you
to cross-question the witness?
- How are you, Coach Mukherji?
- Good, thank you!
- Do you know who Michael Phelps is?
- Of course, sir.
He's a champion.
World's fastest swimmer.
- 18 Olympic golds till now.
- Usain Bolt?
- Seriously?
- Please answer my question, sir.
Yes, of course.
World's fastest athlete.
World record holder in 100m, 200m
and 4x100 m relay.
Lovely.
- Your general knowledge is good.
- Thank you.
Sir, did you know
that Michael Phelps' limbs
are longer than that
of an average man?
Usain Bolt has an extra rare muscle
which only 2 percent of the world's
entire population has,
or even lesser.
Sorry, I didn't know that.
- Do you know Virender Sehwag?
- Of course, who doesn't?
Then you must also know that experts
severely criticised his technique.
Despite that, he scored
two triple centuries
because his hand to eye coordination
is exemplary.
Way better than other batsmen.
Your Honour, why are we being
taught sports?
It is because it's relevant, sir.
I also did a bit of research.
So, Coach, going
by your expert opinion,
Phelps and Bolt ought to be
banned too.
It's because they have
an unfair advantage too.
Just as Rashmi Vira
has higher testosterone,
Phelps has longer limbs,
and Bolt has an extra rare muscle.
Then how is it
a level playing field, sir?
Your Honour, objection.
Eeshit is comparing
apples and oranges here!
- It's ridiculous!
- How is it ridiculous, sir?
Tell me.
When you can ban a female athlete
just because her testosterone levels
are higher,
then why don't we ban those players
who have an advantage
just because of
their genetic makeup?
- Your Honour, look...
- No, Your Honour!
Going by his logic,
every basketball player taller than
the other players should be banned!
Now, he will say that even
Sachin Tendulkar should be banned
because he has God-gifted timing!
Order. Order.
Keep your theories aside, please.
This rule hasn't been set
by the Indian Association
but by the International Council.
Sure, that's convenient.
Pin the blame on the International
Council when it pleases you!
Can't you make policies?
It is your duty to protect
bright athletes like Rashmi
from these preposterous
international rules!
Your Honour, it's quite simple.
Rashmi Vira has higher levels
of testosterone in her blood.
It's a fact.
But Dilip Chopra made it an issue
and pursued his personal agenda.
He conspired against Rashmi
to get her arrested,
and leaked the news to the media
so that she could not
legally challenge this ban.
If he wanted, he could have
followed the protocol
and gone through the right channels
to get her tested.
But Dilip Chopra's intention
was never to create
a level playing field in sports.
And who gave him
this confidence, sir?
The Association.
By following a test
that has no conclusive
scientific basis.
Your Honour, some women naturally
have high testosterone levels.
So, does it...
Does it mean she's not a woman?
I request the honourable court
to disregard this archaic test
and give Rashmi a chance
to run again.
Thereby sending a message
to the International Council
that India refuses to accept their
incongruous and exploitative rules!
Prosecution rests the case, Your Honour.
Rashmi is four months pregnant today.
What's the matter?
Is she woman enough now?
Won't anyone question her gender?
But Rashmi did not let me
use this information, sir.
It's because this fight
is not just about Rashmi.
It's about the ban
that makes the already harsh careers
of female athletes even harder!
We shall take a short break.
The court will pass its verdict
after the break.
'I'm as shocked as you are, '
'but I agree with you, sir.'
Hmm.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I want your resignation on my table
first thing in the morning.
I have taken a vote
of the rest of the members.
Even Team Captain Niharika Chopra
has suggested
that you should be expelled.
'A difficult and historic conundrum
lies before this court today.'
'No Indian court has ever
lifted a ban off an Indian player'
'imposed
by International Council laws.'
'The circumstances are extraordinary
and so is this case.'
'Practices such as the gender test'
'raise many questions
in a society like ours.'
'There's already so much
gender disparity in India.'
'And a gender test only adds to the bias.'
'The manner in which the Indian
Association conducts this test'
'is another predicament in itself.'
'Neither are athletes counseled
nor are they given any prior notice.'
'It is not enough to follow
a manual in such cases.'
'As has been seen in this case, '
'a gender test can also
be used as a tool'
'to raise doubts
about an athlete's gender'
'and hence, her identity itself.'
'Keeping all these things in mind, '
'I'd like to appoint
a special committee'
'that will deal solely with cases
related to gender tests.'
'This committee appointed
by the court shall be composed'
'of two former female athletes, '
'one former male athlete,
a psychologist'
'and a female sports doctor.'
'Also the existing association members
shall be investigated'
'over the handling
of Rashmi Vira's case, '
'especially Dilip Chopra'
'and the male police officers
who arrested Rashmi Vira.'
The international level ban
imposed on Rashmi Vira
is out of the jurisdiction
of this court.
But with regard to
all the events in India,
including the South Asia
Championship trials,
I hereby lift the ban
on Rashmi Vira.
Rashmi Vira will be allowed to run.
All the best, Rocket.
Congratulations!
'The Bombay High Court lifts the ban
on Rashmi Vira'
'allowing her to participate
in the athletic events in India.'
'The Indian Association responsible
for handling Rashmi...' - Good news!
- Praise the Almighty!
- 'Will be under scrutiny.'
'The court even ordered a formal
investigation into the actions'
'of the two male officers...'
- This girl is from our village!
- 'Who had arrested Rashmi Vira.'
We won a battle
to run today's race.
But there were times
when I wanted to give up.
That I couldn't do it.
Then you came along
and everything changed.
You must think you are
a hurdle for me.
You are not.
You were my strength in this battle.
And still are.
But I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask for your consent.
I ask you now.
Just...
All I ask of you is 13 seconds.
Please.
Just 13 seconds.
There will come a day
when I will narrate this story
to you.
Our story.
You know...
Such a young Indian has never
competed in a race before!
He or she...
No matter what your gender,
I love you.
I really love you.
Rashmi.
'This truly is a sight to behold.'
'This gesture by Niharika
and the rest of the athletes'
'is something the spectators
will never forget.'
This is sport!
Don't think I'll let you win
because you're pregnant.
Don't think I will lose
just because I'm pregnant!
- Rocket! Rocket!
- Rocket! Rocket!
- All the best.
- All the best.
Zoom in on her jersey!
Not eight but twelve athletes
shall compete in this race.
Rashmi Vira is not running
for herself,
she is running
for all of them today.
'Victory or defeat is merely
an outcome.'
Our job is to keep trying.
Set!
