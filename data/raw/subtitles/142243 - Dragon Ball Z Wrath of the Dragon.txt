-Yes this is Great Saiyaman #2
-There's a weird old man who climbed to the top of the Randsell Tower!
-Can't you guys taka care of such a small thing yourselves?
Hey! Again...
-Professor I've got to go to the toilet.
-Again?
-It must have been something I ate yesterday.
-Leave me alone! I want to die!
All my hopes and dreams have died! I'm going to throw myself from this tower.
-I saw a bit of this on tv...
-It's some strange little old man...
-Yeah that old little geezer...
-The Great Saiyaman Powers!
Saiyaman! Saiyaman! Saiyaman!
-If doesn't matter who tries to help! I'm jumping!
-Hey Gramps it's dangerous up here. Why don't you come back down with us?
-I... I was to die!
-Let him do it...
-Videl?!
-Hurry up and jump already will you?
-Fine! Watch me!
-He wasn't kidding!
-Save me!
-He did it!
-Are you alright?
-It look you long enought I could have died you know!
-What a weird old man!
-You've never heard of the great hero Tapion?
-Yes that's right.
-What a pity.
Legend has it a thousand years ago in the south of the galaxy he saved the people of the planet Konats.
-Wow!
-Gohan. It's time we were going.
-I'd like to meet him!
-You do...?
-Is he coming to this world?
-Just wanting to meet him isn't enough...
Unfortunately the great hero Tapion is imprisoned inside this beautiful music box.
-He's stuck in there? But how?
-If you help release him he'll tell you about a future threat!
-Gohan hurry up we've gotta go.
-Jus a secound. Old man what was that supposed to mean?
-I fear that this world is in great danger!
-The Earth is in danger?!
-Even now a great galactic evil is heading for this planet. We need the Great Hero Tapion now more that ever!
I've spent over 30 years searching for this music box.
-So wouldn't it be smart to release him now?
-I would have If I could!
-You mean you can't?
-Try and turn the crank.
-This one?
-If you can opet the music box. Tapion will be released.
-Why didn't if you say tha in the first piace?
-It... won't... move!
What's... with... this... thing?
-Let me se.
It's rusted shut!
-Whoa! What are you doung? Hey hey hey!
-Let's go. Class is almost over!
-Hey Videl!
-Shen Long!
You can bring me to the Shen Long!
-Shen Long?
-He's my only hope of freeing Tapion from this prison.
-Old man how...?
-I knew all along you could bring me to the Shen Long! I'm begging you please!
I'm begging you!
-So the incident t the Tower was all a trick then?
-Look's like I've been busted!
-Gramps it sounds like a fantasy story to me.
-I think so too!
-You still don't believe me?
-No time to worry about canvincing you. It the Great Tapion isn't freed soon the whole world could be destroyed.
-This is no good. There's no way to get it open. It's made from some kind of impervious material.
-It's no good. I can't open it.
-If even Goku can't get it open the stroy must be true then.
-Is he powerfull?
-Of course! He was a Great Hero!
-Alright then... Let's go! We'll search for the Dragonballs. All of us.
-The people of Earth are as helpful as I've heard!
-Huh? You're not from Earth?
-Um weil I. uh... It's just an expression!
-Let's go Goten! I want to be the first to find one!
-Me too! I want to meet that Great Hero!
-So the story was true after all i wonder what this hero Tapion is like?
Wow! A real life Great Hero!
-As usual. I wind up alone.
-Found one!
-Got one! Now let's find us a hero!
-Hey there's one!
-How are you going to get it?
-Not a problem.
Here.
That's the last one of them!
We summon you Shen Long!
-Incredible!
This is... Shen Long!
-I can grant anything you desire. Speak your wish!
-I want to free the Great Hero Tapion!
-It shall be done.
Your wish is granted. Until summoned again I leave...
-Hey what a minute! Nothing happened!
-It's turning by ifself...
-What a beautiful melody.
-But what'll happen next...
-He's comming! Here he comes!
He's here!
-Father...
Incredible energy!
-Everything the old man said was true!
-Wow!
-He looks like a nice guy.
-Don't move!
-Cool sword!
-It was you who imprisoned me!
-Sorry to leave you in such a cramped place for 1000 years.
-Return me at once.
-That won't be possible! The music box has been broken.
-Hey hey hey...
You're finally back after all this time. To go back inside is...
-Please leave me alone. You have no idea of the kind of trouble you grought upon yourseives.
-Trouble?
-I want to be just like him!
-What are you talking about?
He has the rudest manners I've ever seen...
-I'll be back!
-Hey Trunks!
-Wait! Come back please!
-What do you think?
-He's got a dangerous feeling about him.
-I don't get it.
-Trunks! We should go back now!
-Wht are you talking about? He's a Great Hero! Don't you want to hear him tell his story?
-But we have to become friends first...
-That's why we're here!
-What is it?
-Just like a Great Hero! He looks troubled!
-Where'd the little old guy go?
-That's right...
-He's probably out looking for cute girls. That's what I'd be doing.
-Not every old man is a disgusting pervert like you!
-You may not be as cute as you used to be but you're not bad for an older woman.
-Hey they're all gone!
-Got one.
-Ummm... Big brother!...
I'll just leave this food over here...
Well... we've got to be going now...
I'll come back tomorrow okay?
-Hey what the hell is going on?! Speed it up!
-What was THAT?
-What's going on?
-This is terrible!
-Saiyaman? Great Saiyaman has come!
Yes! Leave it to me!
-What is that thing?
-What was that?
What is it?!
-Some sort of weapon with legs?
No... It's the bottom half of a monster!
The Great Evil that old man spoke of... could this be it?
-That must be it! Gohan let's go to Plan 'A'.
-We're attacking?
-We have to!
-As long as the Great Saiyaman are here evil will taste defeat!
-Great Saiyaman #1.
-And #2.
-Onward to victory!
-I said TO VICTORY! Weren't you listening?
-Damn!
Nobody wrecks my city like this and gets away with it!
Let's go!
Why won't you fall?
Okay than!
-That's showing him Gohan!
-That's it I have to knock him off balance.
-You did it!
-You did it!
-No not yet!
-I know that melody.
The monster just disappeared?
-Tapion.
-Gohan! Look...
-Big Brother I brought you some stuff...
-Stay away from me.
-No need to get so mad at me!
Haven't you eaten anything yet?
-GO AWAY!
-Right!
-Damn it!
-Wha... what! What happened here?
You're here!
I brought you breakfast...
I know. Gohan said not to brother you! So long! I'll be back later!
-Trunks seceretly smuck him some breakfast this morning.
-Trunks has really got a soft spot for him doesn't he?
-Goten's jealous now that his "big brother" has found a big brother of his own!
-I know how Trunks feels! I'm an only child as well.
But lately it's been getting dangerous...
-It's Tapion who should worry about Trunks power!
-Hey! Stop it! Stop it! That's for my big brother! You're not supposed to eat it...!
Hey big brother! I'm putting your dinner over here okay!
Your flute sounds so nice! Play a little for me?
I guess not!
-You brat! Give me the flute!
-Trunks! The flute!
-Right...
-Wait you brat! Tapion's no Great Hero! He's the monster that destoryed the city!
-Trunks don't believe him.
-The Universe this planet he'll detroy them all with it if you give it back to him!
So give me the flute!
-Trunks trust me.
-That's right! Give me the flute!
-Big brother!
-Wha... wha... Whaaaat?
-Big brother!
I know... I'll leave now.
-You're probably hungry.
Mind joining me for dinner?
This is delicious! You've got to try it!
-Imagine that Trunks mking friends with a Great Hero!
-It's just amazing. He's so excited!
-I don't know how I'll calm him down again!
-Hey! Hey! Hey! This one is my favorite. I got it for my birthday last year!
Isn't it great? Eh? Eh?
If you move this here and this here it turns into THIS!
Here big brother give it a try! This is great! Having you here.
Hey big brother what about youL? Do you have any sibilings?
-Yes I have a little brother.
-Wow cool! What's he like?
-He a lot like you Trunks... a sweet kid.
-Tell me about your planet.
-That's a good idea. My world is in the southern part of the galaxy a world called Konats.
It's a lot like Earth green with life and beautiful.
Until the day an evil wizard released a demon upon us.
We were attacked by Hildegarn.
People were killed. Cities were leveled. Everything was in runs!
Death semmed inevitable. Then a miracle happened.
Minoshiya! Did you die in the midst of all that horror as well?
You stay well Trunks!
-Where are you off to?
We like you you're welcome to stay as long as you like!
It's no intrusign! Trunks couldn't be happler to have you here!
-I'm sorry but I can't.
-Why not?
The spirit of that monster is trapped inside my body!
-Monster spirit? Now I'm confused! Come explain it to me.
So what exactly do you mean by "monster spirit"?
-Alright! I'll tell you the story of how my world was almost destroyed by this monster spirit!
On Konats there were those who practiced the black arts. In return for the energy of our people they were granted great powers by their evil master.
They used their black magis and brought the legendary evil of Hildegarn to life.
-Those warlocks must have possessed incredible dark powers.
-Yes and Hoi is one of them!
-That old man fooled all of us. But why is the monster's spirit in your body?
-The warlocks were the only ones who could control them. Only my legendary flute and sword can keep it in check.
-The warlocks were the only ones who could control them. Only my legendary flute and sword can keep it in check.
-Your flute and sword?
-Yes.
Weapons from the Gods themselves.
While the monster wa held at day by my flute playing a priest used the sword to split the monster in two - a top hait and a bottom half.
Hildegran's bottom hait was imprisoned in my body. His top half was imprisoned in my little brother's.
Please returned to the planet Konats.
It was then that my brother and I became known as Great Heroes.
Then how did you get trapped in the music box?
-The warlocks came after the two of us next.
To assure that the monster was banished forever we agreed to be locked away in the music boxes... forever.
But that wasn't enought though. The closer together we were the greater the danger of the monster escaping.
We were placed in pods and sent to different ends of the galaxy in the hopes that they wouldn't find us.
But Hoi wants the whole universe as his own! That's why he came looking for the music boxes!
-What about your brother?
-Most likely he's been killed.
-This is unforgivable!
-If the top half ever reaches me the full horror of Hildegarn will be released again!
-Is that why for days at  time your never sleep?
-Yes.
-No problem! Leave it to me!
-Ehh?
-How about I build something for you that acts like the music box to help to control the monster's spirit?
-You can do that?
-I haven't thrown out the broken music box yet so I'll give it a try!
-Build it please! I'm begging you!
-Alright then! Wish me luck!
-Yes.
-I've finished it! Meet me in Tapion's bedroom!
-Really?
-It's got the same configuration as the music box.
-Go on in and take a look.
You can rest at ease in here without worry!
-Thank you so much!
-This is not the full glory and might of Hildegarn!
-This is only the beginning of my great conquest of the galaxy!!!
-What was that?
-This is what it was all about then.
-Big brother.
What happened to you?
What about Hildegarn?
I don't know how but the top half is inside me now...
But the bottom half is attacking the city!
-What?
-If the two halves become whole he'll possess unbelievable power! You'll be no hope against him!
-Big brother.
Maybe I can build something more powerful to help you!
-NO! While Hildegarn is still trapped inside me you must kill me!
-Big brother!
-Do it quickly!
-No you don't!
-Trunks!
-Big brother! Play it!
-Right!
-Big brother!
-His body...
-Reformed!
-After a thousand years of waiting the mighty Hildegarn is whole again!
Now drink deeply of these Earthling's energy!
-Big brother!
-It doesn't matter what you try. He's unstoppable!
-You fool!
-Now you will taste the full power of Hildegarn!
-We can beat him!
-Father!
-From here on in you should leave it up to me. Stay right here Big brother!
-Trunks.
-We aren't so easily beaten!
-For something that huge. It sure moves fast!
-Father!
-I can't tell where he's going to reform!
-You've really done it now.
You've destoryed my home! Don't get too close to me because I'm burning eith rage!
Damn it!
I can't compare to him... either!
-Vegeta!
-Papa!
-Father!
-Goten we have to fuse!
-F-U-S-I-O-N HA!!!
Now you face a third stage Super Saiyajin.
Hey hey you monster! This has gone far enought Gotenks is here to send you back to hell!
Rapid fire death missile barrage!
Hey hey!
Ohh? Is that the best you had to offer? Big wimp!
-What are you doing? Finish him off!
-Okay okay!
Taka that!
-It... can't be!?
-No way!
-Goten! Trunks!
-Gohan!
-Videl.
-Such unbelievable power! That monster!
Damn it!!
All this damage... innocent people will be hurt.
Damn! No matter how much... we throw at it...
...it just won't fall.
-That's it! Destory the entire galaxy! All of it will become energy for Hildegarn to feed on!
-Why can't I wake up from this nightmare?
-Big brother.
-You fool! It's too late for that now!
What?!
-A Great Hero... Big brother is definitely a Great Hero!
-I'm not going to let you ruln this world too!
Feeding on the suffering of people!
With your never ending hunger!
-You can't!
-You did it! You did it! Big Brother!
-Trunks!
Now that Hidegarn and I are one you must kill me!
You must kill me!
-I can't do that!
-Do you want to be a Great Hero or not?
I can't!
Trunks the whole world is in danger while I'm alive. Do it! I want to die as a hero!
If we imprison him one more time he'll never be free again! Do it!
Thank you. I'm lucky to have met you.
-NOOOOO! YOUUUU BASTARRRRRRRRD!
-Big brother!
-You fool! Did you think that you alone could hold back the might of Hildegarn?
I win!
-This must go no further.
Trunks that's enought! He's mine to finish!
-Father his weak point...
-I know it!
I only have one chance to finish him while he's in his full form.
Is that all you've got?
That last punch... was pretty weak!
Hey come on! Let's see what you've got!
I've got to do this.
I can't lose now!
It I don't do it...
Who will?
DRAGONFIST!
-He did it!!!
It's my fault that all these people had to die. If only I could control it!
-Don't worry. Shen Long will be able to revive all those that were killed.
-That should do it. It's set. 1000 years in the past... your timeline.
-Thank you.
Oh oh just when I finally had a big brother and now he's leaving.
-As long as he's got the time machine you two will meet again.
-Hey that's right!
-Trunks!
-For me?
-Yeah! I've got no use for it anymore.
-Wow alright!
-Lucky!!
-Take care everyone and be well!
