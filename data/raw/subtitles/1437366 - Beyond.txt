Beyond
Hey, they're on their way.
Pretend you're asleep.
- I've got to...
- Hush!
Act like you're asleep.
Clad in her gown of white
Crowned with a wreath of light
- Santa Lucia, Santa Lucia...
- Look who's here!
- It's lovely!
- I did mostly everything...
Best job I've ever seen!
- So you did it all, huh?
- Well, I made the sandwiches!
Can I have one?
Nice...
I'll get it!
Hey, we have time for...
- She always gets there first.
- You can answer next time. I promise.
It's for you.
- Leena speaking.
- Hello, Leena...
It's me, your mother.
- Do you give up? - Do you?
- No! - Who was it?
- Who was it?
- Nobody...
- Let it ring.
- Let Flisan get it.
But... Don't, girls.
- It's probably another crank call...
- Why don't you want to get that?
- I just did, and...
- I'll get it.
- No, just ignore it.
- Let it ring.
- I can get it.
If it's that important, I'll get it.
Leena speaking.
This is the Ystad County Hospital,
your mother asked me to call.
She tried herself,
but the call was disconnected.
- Why are you calling?
- Your mother is seriously ill.
We could be talking about hours here,
and she would like to see you.
Who was it?
- What's going on?
- I'll be right out.
Mum... we've overslept!
Mum, you've got
to take Sakari to school, wake up!
I'm coming...
- Today's my first day at school.
- Good boy.
Here, eat this on the way.
Paradise...
Peace. Happiness.
Cliques: Groups of people.
Spectators:
People who watch.
Bring some drawing stuff along.
- Are two pairs of panties enough?
- Sure.
- Has Grandma always been ill?
- No... I don't know much, though.
- I didn't think we had a Grandma.
- Neither did I.
Mum doesn't like talking about it.
- How far is it to Ystad?
- 600 kilometres...
What's going on?
We'll stop for food on the way.
We're not going anywhere!
We have got this funny cow
with funny little horns...
Louder!
- Can I listen to Mama Moo again?
- No!
- Are you going to call her Gran?
- I don't know.
I won't...
About time we had
something to eat, right?
I won't be in tomorrow.
Leena's mum has risen from dead,
so we're on our way to Ystad.
Don't forget the trim
in the bedroom. Take care!
- Well, it's true...
- What's the big deal?
People lose touch
with their parents every day.
- Mum, can we have candy?
- No, put it back.
- Come on...
- I said, put it back.
Give me the car keys.
Parquet floors...
Hot water on tap...
Indoor toilet...
Glass door...
Contract...
Vow of sobriety...
Kicking your kids
out of the nest already?
We gonna buy sheeds...
Grow the prettiest sunflowers...
Dad, it's "seeds"...
My old lady's gonna have
the prettiest flowers. Here...
The name's Moilanen... Kimmo.
Dad's name was Olli.
Almost like your Olof...
...not allowed to paint or
paper the walls without permission.
Parties shall be restricted
to major occasions.
The rent is to be paid
at the end of each month.
It's all here, in the contract.
- What did she say?
- To pay the rent.
- I good woodworker.
- Really...
- I hope you'll like it here.
- Thank you...
Thank your company, too.
This is a parquet floor, you know.
You might want to use coasters...
Like we're going to redecorate
a flat as nice as this?
- What a bitch!
- Oh, I almost forgot...
Don't flush newsprint or anything else
that might clog the drains. Good day.
Good day... Thank you.
Did you hear that? About flushing
newsprint down the toilet?
Like we were
ignorant pigs, or something!
And you just stood there, grovelling!
Christ!
- Sakari, stop it.
- Aili... Calm down.
I am calm...
You just stood there,
so bloody grateful and all...
Let's put the kids to bed.
In the middle of the day?
Our new flat is really nice
and there's so much space.
Everyone's really happy...
Mum most of all.
Hi...
Pretty...
Sten bought it...
That's Mum's boyfriend.
He's a pain.
Come here...
- May I have a look?
- Sure.
- Nice...
- Take it.
Thank you.
Move your butt...
I nicked this from Sten...
He's got loads of them.
Oh... Where did you come from?
- We just moved in.
- That's nice!
- Hi, I'm Inga-Lill.
- Leena.
That's Veikko's mum's chair...
Isn't it nice?
Careful... Careful!
Everybody's doing the samba...
Now nobody's doing the samba
They'd rather do the...
- The tango!
- No: "the rumba"!
See, there's hot water, too!
- Oh my, who's there?
- Terrie...
Get out of there! Scoot!
No hiding in the cupboards!
You silly-billy...
Look how nice and shiny it is!
- And how about this?
- An extra door.
Shit as long as you like, Kimmo,
we can still take a bath.
You'll have it good here.
My very own balcony!
Here's to your balcony, cheers!
No thanks... No.
- Three months.
- What the hell...
- Just a sip?
- No!
I figured I'd introduce myself.
Sten Hård...
I'm a foreman over at ENEPE.
- We have party...
- Come on over, the booze is on me.
No... But thanks anyways.
- See you tomorrow at 6:30.
- Absolutely, 6:30.
- Come on.
- That's my...
Hello!
Shit...
Neighbours with the foreman,
you'll have to be on your toes.
Better get us a vacuum cleaner,
Kimmo, it has its very own cupboard!
- I'll be sharing it with Sakari.
- Poor you.
- Careful, Kimmo...
- Careful!
Careful! Please be careful!
For God's sake... No!
Kimmo!
Kimmo, please...
What the hell are you doing?!
Leena!
Christ, you almost got us killed!
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.
We're in this together.
Daddy, Flisan was really scared.
Don't worry,
we were just letting off steam...
I love you.
How about Alphabet Songs? I'll do "A".
All the birdies...
You know, the one you do at school?
- Marja, it's your turn. "B".
- Bollibompa...
- Okay, Flisan, "C".
- I pass "C" on to Daddy.
So I get to do "C"?
Citron and Citronita,
are Smurfadelic favourites...
That's all I remember.
Good job!
Push out harder,
and you'll get further.
Remember to keep
your ankles close together.
Like a unit. Think "Esther Williams".
Onwards and upwards...
Pancakes: good to eat.
Fall flat as a pancake:
Things go wrong.
- Oh, I see you're a gymnast.
- No, she swims.
- This will do. It's fine.
- Mum...
- Take it easy.
- Stop it, Sakari.
- We don't have any soccer shoes.
- Stop it!
- It was a perfect fit.
- Perfect...
Period...
Periodical drinker...
Where's Terrie?
Where did that dog get to?
No problem...
Attention, girls!
We've barely started
and we're already running late.
Line up by the pool and get ready.
Welcome to the club.
- This is Moilanen, she's new.
Tell your parents
to get you a decent suit.
We have two seasons to prepare
for the Junior Championship.
So I want to see some hard work.
If you're not prepared to work,
don't bother showing up.
All right if I stand here?
Delighted: happy, liking things...
Dread...
Dread is worrying
that bad things will happen.
Second floor.
I just know that sort of thing...
Hello.
52, 53, 54, 55... This is it.
- Can we just walk in?
- That's what they said.
- I'll see if she's awake.
- Can I come along?
Let Mummy go in first. Come on.
That's not her.
There must be some mistake.
- Hang on.
- That wasn't my mum...
- May I help you?
- We're here to see Aili Moilanen.
- The woman in there is your mother.
- The staff ought to know.
- Hello, I'm Johan.
- I'm glad you could make it.
- That tinsel is so pretty!
- Yes, it brightens things up.
Use the buzzer if you need anything.
- Well, this is my family...
- Family?
- Hello, I'm Johan.
- I'm Leena's mother.
Come and say hello, girls.
Hello...
- Marja.
- What a pretty name.
Flisan.
- What did she say?
- Her name is Felicia.
Funny name...
Never heard it before.
You've cut your hair...
Would you like anything
from the shop?
- There's nothing I need.
- Well then, maybe we should...
- Well, the rubbish and my plants...
- We'll take care of it.
My handbag... It's in there.
- Is this it?
- Yes. Thank you.
- Need any help?
- Help me find my keys.
I can't seem to find them...
- There. Shall I give them to Leena?
- Yes, Leena...
Let me close it for you.
- The girls are hungry and tired...
- Of course they are.
- My wedding rings, I left them behind.
- Where are they?
I don't know.
On the side board, maybe...
- If it's not too much trouble?
- No, don't worry.
- Bye.
- That's very kind of you. Bye.
Leena... There's something
I'd like to say to you.
Come me some closer...
Could you bring Daddy?
Please, bring Daddy to me.
- Which one's mine?
- That one. "Keijo Liimatainen".
That's its name.
Keijo is going to be
the biggest sunflower in Sweden.
Good night.
Look at me sproutsies...
They need love and care, like babies.
Then the sunflowers grow tall.
When I get new job...
Then I will stand on my toes...
Be ON your toes.
You come from Finland.
We strong people, good genes.
You practice plenty hard...
You win all races.
You have spirit like me, "sisu"...
You fighter, like me.
And you get reward.
We show Helsinki!
You buy pretty white boots...
...and fine coat.
We stay Grandma...
Go Fazer café.
We show them plenty good!
Time Daddy's athlete sleep.
Sing...
Friday's assignment:
The capitals of Europe.
Ingela... Have your parents
signed that note yet?
- How about that one?
- You can't swim in a bikini.
- Red would set off your hair.
- Yellow's the in colour, though.
- Bengt says we have to look alike.
- Boring...
- How do you wear your bangs?
- Flipped out.
- Can you sew something like this?
- Possibly...
Now all that's left is the mirrors.
- The mirrors...
- Right.
- Mum, is that my money?
- No, that's for the cleaners.
Your money's in the kitchen.
- We're done...
- It looks great.
- You were ever so good!
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.
Bloody cow!
Acting like we might steal from her...
Stay clear of people like that!
Never sell yourself short.
Wait... Hold the bike.
- That's too much.
- No. You did a good job.
Now do well in school, so you can
make a better life for yourself.
Hurry up, before they close...
- Thank you!
- Sweetie...
Everyone's here, so let's get to work.
Nice suit, Moilanen...
Now we're a real team.
On your marks...
Go!
Good...
Get serious, Moilanen!
Swing like a pendulum, people!
I'm on fire...
I burn bright, like a sparkler.
Or like a light bulb
right before it goes poof.
In my dreams,
the buildings are all on fire.
- How long was it last time?
- 30...
- Guess what?
- I don't know...
42.
- Tell me about Esther Williams.
- You've heard that a hundred times.
Please?
- In America... What?
- Start at the beginning.
Where was I?
- I want to get in!
- No, you always pee in the water!
We lived in a tiny flat,
one room and a kitchenette.
Like we did, before we came here.
Then the Esther Williams
Swim School opened.
- And you were one of the stars?
- Oh, yes...
No... Then came the war...
We kids had to work. I was a maid.
They paid us in food,
there was a shortage of everything.
I never swam again,
I didn't have the time.
I had to work, work, work...
Supper's ready!
It smelled bad in there...
Bloody awful
to end up helpless like that.
- Make a right turn.
- Here?
Hey, Aili!
Give me a god-damn hand with this!
Come and see what I got.
Wake up, you cow!
Daddy...
For fuck's sake... BITCH!
Are you asleep in there, or what?
They can hear you shouting
all over town!
What's the good of a sofa
if we get evicted?!
Go on...
What do we do with a sofa if we get...
Bloody hell!!
I'll hold you...
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...
...eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen...
One, two, three...
I brought you a sofa,
and all I get is grief!
- Go ahead, hit me!
- 10, 11, 12, 13...
Look at all this stuff!
She sure has a lot of stuff...
Did you use to live here?
Check it out, Flisan,
more stuff than you!
- Want me to take that out?
- No, I'll do it later.
- What about this?
- I'll take care of that later.
- Looks like bills...
- Leave it, I'll take care of it.
- Maybe we should take them along.
- Go sit with the girls...
Johan, please?
- There's loads of them...
- I'll take care of it.
- Daddy, I'm hungry.
- We'll get something to eat.
Don't put them there!
Stop it, I'll be right out...
Christ... What's going on here?
- I told you not to touch anything!
- Hey, she's trying to help you out.
- This isn't helping!
- Relax, I'll take care of it.
I told you not to touch anything!
The pictures go here...
- Is this you, Mummy?
- No... Yes.
You look like Marja.
- Who are these people?
- My parents.
- What a funny moustache.
- She looks so different here...
Who's this?
- My little brother.
- You have a little brother?
How old is he?
- Does he live here?
- No.
- Are we going to meet him?
- No, he's dead. Where does this go?
- I need to pee.
- I'll take her...
There, now you can go.
- May I help?
- Sure...
You have to press down pretty hard.
And in there...
- May I have a hug?
- Nope.
Please?
Pretty please?
- I'm staying with Åse tonight.
- I want to sleep at Åse's house, too!
- That was delicious.
- It was lovely.
- What about your dishes?
- Sten!
The girls need to learn
about neatness and order.
Do you know how to wash glasses?
No... That's all wrong.
Cold water leaves spots.
See for yourself...
It doesn't look nice, does it?
What are you laughing at?
I'll show you how it's done.
Grab hold,
they're not fragile little ladies.
- Now rinse...
- Leave the girls alone, Sten.
- Are they screwing?
- No...
- Sure sounds like it.
- He's beating her.
"Aggressive: Violent and angry."
"Antabus: Drinking alcohol
makes you sick."
Johan...
"Alcoholic: A person
with a drinking problem."
"License plate: A car's 'name'."
This is brilliant...
- "Withdrawal"...
- Let's get out of here.
"Not getting what you're addicted to."
"Orgasm: Sexual pleasure
with a climax."
"Puck: the 'ball' in ice hockey."
"Balls: A part of a man's genitals."
That's fantastic.
- Where did you get all this?
- I overheard things...
I miss you.
- Do you trust me?
- Of course I do.
I don't know...
It's like we...
I don't know who you are.
Let's just stay here tonight, okay?
I'm too tired to go anywhere now.
I can't do it...
Well, maybe if I slept out
on the balcony...
"Wish list: A new bathing suit."
"Happy, sober, parents.
A nice Christmas."
"Gloves, a scarf, a necklace, beads,"
"patent leather boots, white."
"Fancy erasers for my collection."
What happened to your brother?
Did he commit suicide?
Talk to me! Did he kill himself?
Leena, what happened? Come on!
A pack of Marlboro lights, please.
Help me up... Up...
Lower...
- Lower?
- Up...
- I'm not quite sure what happened.
- Just press that...
- Where is he?
- Johan? He's with the girls.
Dad, where's Dad?
Dad's right there.
Can I have a look?
I've been so worried...
Come and sit down.
I've never had it better
than in this place...
I just ring a bell,
and I get whatever I want.
That's good...
It's just that I'm dying for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette?
No, you don't smoke.
- Sometimes it's all I think about.
- What?
Getting to take a few puffs...
Really?
- I've got to go.
- No, stay...
Was my ring on the sideboard?
Oh, I forgot to look...
I cleaned up. And you have
bills from collection agencies...
For the first time in my life,
it makes no difference if I pay or not!
Not so fast, sweetie...
Could you tell Dad to let Terrie out?
A kiss? Sakari, a kiss?
Good...
Good...
Try to make them even in thickness,
but a bit smaller, all right?
He's drunk.
Leena, sweetheart...
Bring in the fudge, all right?
Let's all sit down together.
Why don't you do that later?
I told you to take it easy...
Sit here, Mum.
Look, children...
A brilliant Christmas.
Christmas tree...
- Finish that later...
- Get off my back!
Fucking cunt!
Come sit with me.
- God damn it!
- You stubborn bastard!
God damn it!
Let the fucker be...
Bitch!
- Stop it!
- I want you out of here!
I'm not going anywhere, you bitch!
Get off me!
This is the last time
you call me "fucking cunt"!
Stubborn: To cling to a standpoint.
Hermit: Someone who
lives alone, a loner.
Elite: A select group of people
who are the best.
That's nice, honey...
Cleaning up like that and everything.
Sakari, come here.
Mummy loves you...
I love you.
I love you.
Aili...
I'm cold!
Sorry... I'm sorry.
Aili? Aili!
- Don't listen to him.
- You're being too hard on me! Aili!
- You damn pig!
- I love you so...
I'll stop, I promise!
Not another drop after the holidays.
- Your promises aren't worth shit!
- I swear, right after the holidays.
They never stopped growing...
Your dad's sunflowers.
Open wider...
He gave them so much love.
It wasn't love...
He watered them with piss.
I want... Please...
God damn it!
Don't you ever touch my liquor!
- She says she won't race.
- Where is she?
What the hell is going on here?
How the hell are we supposed
to win if you're in the locker room?!
- I have a stomach ache.
- Not during a championship, you don't.
Get out there!
On your marks...
They're off!
Lane six
takes the lead from the start.
Looks like it will be Leena Moilanen
or Carolina Cassel...
Cassel is picking up speed...
But here comes Moilanen,
what an exciting race!
Cunt, whore, witch.
Hag, cow, cunt.
Bitch, pussy.
Witch, whore, cunt, bitch...
We have a winner!
This year's Junior Champion
is Leena Moilanen from YSK.
Carolina Cassel, YSK,
came in second...
Good job, Moilanen!
Saw squirrel...
Living here was hard on your dad.
He never settled in...
We should have gone back to Finland.
- We're going back inside.
- Wait...
There's something...
Please sit here, sweetie.
There's something
I'd like to talk about.
Please...
You have to make sure...
...that your dad and I
rest together.
Could you promise me that?
Take a bite...
Please eat something!
If you do, I'll make you a bath.
With lots of bubbles.
You like that, don't you?
Go on, take a bite...
This itty-bitty tip right here?
Please?
There are some people at the door
who want to talk to you.
I'm coming...
Leena, don't let them see us.
Talk to them. Stall them...
Hello, I'm Margareta Persson
from Social Services.
This is my colleague, Niklas Lindberg.
Please excuse the mess,
I haven't been well lately.
- Would you like some coffee?
- We won't be long...
So this is Sakari, I presume...
He's... That's Sakari.
Say hello ladies, Sakari.
- Hi, I'm Niklas. What's your name?
- It's Sakari...
- He's a mute.
- He's just shy.
- Have something to eat, honey.
- Hello...
- Margareta Persson, Social Services.
- Kimmo... Kimmo Moilanen.
Hi, Niklas... Hello, I'm Niklas.
The whole family is here - that's nice.
What are they doing here?
- Shall we make coffee?
- They don't want any.
Thank you,
but that won't be necessary...
Your son hasn't
been in school for a while.
- Are they from school?
- Shut up!
He had the flu.
He'll be going to school tomorrow.
School is good... very good.
You'll see to it, that he'll be back?
He'll be going tomorrow.
- It is good... very good.
- Yes. Good.
We'll be contacting you.
You and the school.
- Contacting...
- Calling us.
Well, we'll be going...
- Goodbye...
- Bye, Sakari.
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Niklas...
Wait!
You've got to take him with you!
Why did you send
for those social workers?
- Why?
- I didn't.
They just knew they'd better come!
See how it feels to live without me!
You never loved me!
Don't you try to push me around!
Mum...
You've got to come.
Mummy's dying.
There's blood everywhere.
We can leave Dad.
When you get well again...
Mummy?
Get the door for me, will you?
Leena!
Come on, we've got to go.
- The children can stay with me.
- Social Services is already involved.
- I want to stay with you!
- I know the family well...
It's out of our hands...
My dear little Sakari...
I signed the papers for his own good.
They convinced me...
I thought he would get better.
I couldn't cope...
The poor boy had so much bad luck.
And then, that accident...
There were good times, though.
All those parties...
Your dad was a great dancer.
I loved dancing with him...
We didn't have any nice parties.
They were disgusting drunken messes!
Vomit, blood and a bunch of shit!
We almost drowned
in your fucking Finnish misery!
Sakari didn't make it! Because of us,
and those god-awful institutions!
There was no accident.
He didn't have bad luck.
- He overdosed on drugs.
- Was I to blame?
He'd been dead for days when they
found him. Skinny, only 45 kilos...
That's a lie!
Hello?!
No!
- Mum, they're taking Sakari!
- Calm down...
I didn't mean take HIM!
- No, you can't take Sakari!
- Stop fussing.
Sakari!!
What's the matter?
She wanted to smoke...
She wanted to smoke,
so I took her out on the terrace.
What's wrong with that?
She's going to die anyway.
All right...
What did the hospital staff say?
So you and Mum
rolled out to have a smoke...
Did you have a nice time?
Get dressed, because I want to leave.
Wake the girls up.
Sit down and have a glass of wine.
What are they wearing?!
- Where did they get those clothes?
- I don't know. Let them sleep.
- Where did they get them?!
- Some bag...
I want to know,
weren't you paying attention?!
- What are you doing?
- Take that off! - You, too!
- Get out of those clothes!
- What's wrong with you?!
Why didn't you stop them?!
- Leave the stuff in here alone!
We drove clear across the country
to help you see your mother!
I didn't ask you to!
It was your stupid idea to come here!
Don't take this out on the kids!
For God's sake, cool it!
You're scaring the girls!
Take them and leave!
Pull yourself together!
Would you calm down?!
Let go of me!
- Calm down!
- Let go of me, you bastard!
Daddy? Somebody
wants to talk to Mummy.
Go wait in the kitchen.
Everything will be all right. - Hello.
I should have been there!
Not like this...
I should have been there!
My mummy...
My mummy and my daddy...
I've always thought
that I could have...
That it wasn't...
That I could have done more,
made it all better...
That it was my fault.
He could have been alive today.
Of course it wasn't your fault.
You were a child, Leena.
Come here...
I'm sorry... So sorry.
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Mummy...
