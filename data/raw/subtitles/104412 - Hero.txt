Mister foreman,
have you arrived at a verdict?
We have, your honour.
We find the defendant
guilty of all charges.
- He has no priors--
- That's misleading.
He has no convictions.
- Is he dangerous?
- No, but he's a slippery little shit.
Your honour,
request bail be continued--
He's already wasted the jury's time,
not to mention yours.
- He has no priors, your honour.
- Judge, lock him in now.
No, your honour.
He's a very decent family man.
But he has no priors.
He has no convictions.
I don't care about the pri--
Misleading?
- Is he violent?
- He wouldn't hurt a flea.
- I mean, a fly.
- You're very naive.
I'm not naive!
That's enough of this.
All right, I'm going with you.
I got your bail continued.
I don't want my bail continued.
Mr. LaPlante, they found you guilty.
Guilty? What do you mean?
The jury found you guilty.
I'm innocent, for chrissake!
Mr. LaPlante, I've been persuaded,
in view of your continued employment...
...and your lack of priors...
...to continue your bail
under the same conditions...
...pending sentencing six days from now.
In the meantime, make an appointment
with a probation officer...
...who will make a recommendation to me
regarding your sentence.
I urge you...
...to use those six days to get
your personal affairs in order...
...in anticipation of incarceration.
In anticipation of incarceration.
'' In anticipation of incarceration.''
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I know what he means. I'm not
a prison kind of guy, Miss O'Day.
You're not doing your job. Last time
my lawyer got the charges dismissed.
That's why the district attorney
is so hard-nosed this time.
- An appeal?
- We don't have the grounds.
What we have to do is focus
on the probation officer's report.
He gives a good report and I walk?
I think a suspended sentence
is unlikely. Now....
You still have your job, right?
I've been calling in sick.
And a son by your ex-wife, Joseph?
A son? Yeah.
What about him? Joey.
Are you involved in his upbringing?
Involved?
She attached my paycheck, child support.
Why do you think I got a court-appointed
lawyer instead of an experienced one?
I understand.
How often do you see your son?
The kid? I don't know.
On his birthday. When was that?
May, I think.
She don't like for me to see him.
Thinks I'm a bad influence.
I think you should see your son.
Try to get your boss to write a note
about your performance on the job.
Create the impression of a decent
citizen with familial responsibilities...
...who happened to slip up once.
And I know that you're having
financial difficulties, Mr. LaPlante...
...but I was wondering if the money
that I loaned you last week....
Some of it.
I'll get you the rest as soon as I can.
If you're a little short, it's okay.
I don't want to take your last dime.
I'd better keep some of it,
if I'll see the kid.
For gas and stuff.
Look at that one.
If you were in there, he'd kill you.
Wouldn't he, Dad?
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.
You know this friend
that your mother's seeing?
What is he, a fireman?
Did he ever, you know, just kind of
spend the night? What's his name?
Sometimes. His name is Elliott.
He saved a guy's life
one time in a fire.
A hero?
Was he ever in the Nam,
this guy Elliott?
The '' Nam''? What's that?
It was this war, Vietnam.
Doesn't matter.
Were you in it? In the war?
- You didn't see that picture?
- What picture?
Me in my uniform.
Used to be over the fireplace.
In public restrooms,
you're always standing in piss.
It don't matter to you.
You got sneakers.
But I'm standing in piss
in very expensive shoes.
I don't want piss on them.
I want to protect them.
It's a breakdown in custodial services.
Look, somebody lost their wallet.
What?
- Wait a minute.
- To give it to the manager.
He pockets the dough,
throws the wallet away.
We'll go out back. Most people who work
in supervisory positions are crooks.
You didn't pay.
The waiter knows me.
I got an account here.
Tomorrow, when I get to the office...
...my secretary will phone this guy up
from the name on his license.
Let the guy come and get his wallet.
Make sure you get a reward.
You deserve a reward.
Spare some change, sir?
No way, fella. Not a chance.
Resist the urge to be nice
to those people.
They're con artists.
Take advantage of the soft heart.
A lot of them are better off
than the rest of us.
Look out for number one.
It sounds harsh...
...but it's a goddamn jungle out there.
You got to keep a low profile.
Right?
A low profile.
Hey, Bernie. Where you been, pal?
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?
Spanish kind of guys?
Business thing.
Give me a seven and seven, will you?
Five days now, I don't see you?
It's because I'm up to my ass in shit.
I'm broke because I got legal problems.
Nobody was asking for me, huh?
Nope.
Legal problems?
You gotta have a good attorney.
She's just out of law school. A couple
years older than my kid, for chrissake.
You got a kid?
How old's your kid?
Nine, I think. Maybe 1 0.
Yeah, 1 0. Nice kid.
You got a 1 0-year-old attorney, Bernie?
I can't afford no better.
My ex, she attached my paycheck
for child support payments.
You looking for Bernie LaPlante
by any chance?
You have a kid?
Kids are so young.
They don't know nothing yet.
When you're a kid, you think
you'll grow up to be wonderful...
...instead of an asshole,
like everybody else.
We're all assholes?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna
be this fantastic, heroic human being.
Are you Bernie LaPlanta?
LaPlante. Bernie LaPlante.
You the guys that Bunny called?
Three hours is old, man. Very old.
He might not have reported them
at all yet. He might not know.
What did you do? Pick his pocket?
More or less.
Trust me. These are very, very fresh.
To be honest with you, it doesn't
make sense to me either, Miss Gayley.
Things seem to be on the upswing.
Our difficulties with the SEC
have been favourably resolved.
In a business sense,
I think we've turned the corner.
Your wife and children are
on the way here. Don't you--
Thank you for coming out here
and letting me talk to you.
Oh, my God! Chucky, tilt down!
Did you get it?
Jesus! Did I say that?
Yeah, I got it!
Sports training.
Learn to follow the ball!
Listen, how about you do
your wrap-up from up here?
I'll pull back from that skyscraper,
find you here, then reveal the drop.
Suicide number 1 37 of this year,
in this city...
...was neither a destitute,
nor a lonely man...
...but a successful executive
with a loving family...
...and 40 million dollars in the bank.
If there's nameless despair
in executive offices...
... what can there be 60 stories below,
where the hungry and the homeless...
... the brutalized and the addicted,
fight their daily battle for survival?
From a ledge 60 stories
above the street...
...I'm Gale Gayley for Channel 4 News.
What'd you think of the fall shot?
The guy drops 20 stories
in perfect focus, centre frame...
...while I smoothly go
from F1 6 to F56.
Hell of a shot, Chucky.
It's beautiful. Parker!
Run this to Frazier.
Open with it at 6, 1 1 and 7 a.m.
Bet she pushed him just
for the great shot. Blind ambition.
Pushed him? Oh, my God.
Not really?
Conklin's jealous
because it wasn't his story.
It tore her up because
we couldn't save the guy.
She wanted to reach out.
Like the suicide?
- Never reach out.
- Mr. Wallace.
It's unprofessional.
You could get pulled over.
- What are we talking about?
- How we didn't save him.
Saving people is not our job.
It's wrong to step in and save someone.
You wouldn't push him?
I didn't say we should've saved him.
I said I wish it had occurred to me
to consider saving him.
- What good would that do?
- It'd make me feel human.
It's not a bad story.
'' Newswoman Saves Suicide.''
- It's unprofessional.
- You can't bear good news.
- You're sitting on your ticket.
- Ticket? What's going on?
She's flying to N.Y.
for a Silver Mike Award.
Silver Mike?
You are covering us in glory.
Well, I haven't won yet.
You have me scheduled on a flight back
an hour after the ceremony.
For heaven's sake, let's give her
a night in N.Y.C. Listen.
We'll put her boyfriend--
She broke up with her boyfriend.
We need you back
to follow up on that jumper.
The human interest in the unending woe
pouring from the wounded metropolis.
- The dirt, you mean?
- That too.
Would you put me up
in a really good hotel?
Absolutely.
So long, babe.
Okay, the hell with it.
Party on. Is that what they say?
I'll figure something out.
She's pretending to be a person.
She's a reporter.
$50 says she'll be back
on the first flight.
I don't understand what you mean
by ''technicality,'' Mr. LaPlante.
You were found guilty
by a jury of your peers.
The cops didn't follow
the correct procedure with the evidence.
That should have been
established by your attorney.
I'm broke. I got this court-appointed
lawyer. She don't know nothing.
Mr. LaPlante...
...my job is to make a recommendation
for sentencing, based on this interview.
I'm not a criminal.
Buying stolen goods?
It's a little technical thing.
Do I rob anybody? Do I hit anybody?
Don't clutter up prisons
with guys like me.
Prisons are for tough guys.
Prisons are for guys who like
to beat each other up.
I can't do that kind of time. I don't
belong in that kind of environment.
Give me a break.
Look.
I got this kid, 9, 1 0 years old.
I'm taking him to the movies
tonight after work.
He worships me.
If I go to the slammer,
what's this going to do to the kid?
I'm his goddamn role model,
for chrissake.
I don't have to explain how much my
cameraman, editor, assignment editor...
...and news director, to name a few,
did to get me this award.
This is an onion.
It's a metaphor for a news story.
A few hours ago, I was standing on
a ledge 60 stories above the street...
...interviewing a man who subsequently
jumped to his death.
Forty million dollars in the bank,
happily married, good health.
Great story.
But there's got to be more.
I mean, we're pros, right?
Some kind of extramarital
hanky-panky, maybe?
Another great story.
Maybe the guy's been accused
of child molesting.
A terrific story.
What? It turns out
the accusations were false?
Wonderful. More story.
Maybe the alleged mistress was lying.
Setting the guy up, huh?
Sensational story.
So we keep going.
Excuse me. Keep digging.
Keep investigating.
We expose the guy's whole life.
His family.
Why? Because we're pros.
Because we're looking for the truth.
But what if it turns out,
after all our digging...
...after all our
painstaking investigation....
What if it turns out
there wasn't any truth?
Just stories.
One story after another,
until there's nothing left.
And do we have any obligation
to stop at any point?
Or do we just keep going, digging,
peeling until we've peeled it all away?
Until we've destroyed what
we investigated in the first place.
I'll bet all of you, like me...
...yearn for just one story...
...that isn't about unveiling
layer after layer of human weakness.
A story that reveals,
with each layer of investigation...
...something finer and nobler.
Something even inspirational.
No, it's very nice, actually.
'' For Excellence
in the Pursuit of Truth.''
Listen, I got a seat back
on the early flight after all. So....
What? What do you mean
you gave it to Conklin?
He wasn't the one
the guy wanted to talk to!
You were gonna do the town, remember?
Fancy suite at the station's expense,
see a show, maybe get laid.
- What was I supposed to do?
-Cut the shit!
I'm not gonna hang around N. Y. while
you give away my stories to Conklin!
You get back tonight, doll.
I'll take Conklin off your suicide.
Fly carefully.
Congratulations on the award.
What did I tell you?
They're all alike, the good ones.
They're junkies for the story.
Can't let go.
First rule out here on the streets is,
watch out for number one.
If you go down, you break a bone,
you're gone. Nobody'll pick you up.
Shitty colour.
Look at the skin tones.
Chrissake. Homeless people are
supposed to have shitty skin tones.
There you go. Skin tones.
I wouldn't even do this
if I didn't have legal problems.
Ninety-five dollars, that's it.
I got to get out of here.
I gotta take my kid to the movies.
- I'm late. My kid's waiting.
- Fifty.
How about a watch? Wanna buy a watch?
Same kind I got, huh?
Tell you what. Give me $85
for the machine, the watch.
I'll throw in a couple of wheel covers,
a case of insect repellent. Here.
You need an air filter?
I could've predicted this.
It's raining because
my wipers are all fucked up.
If my wipers were okay, the fucking sun
would be shining at night.
Damn it!
Damn it!
We're experiencing a high reading
on one of our indicators.
Probably a malfunction in the gauge,
but as a precaution...
... fasten your seat belts while we
run you through some safety procedures.
First, make sure that your seat belts
are fastened securely.
When the captain gives the signal,
brace your arms...
...against the seat in front
of you like this.
You may use pillows and blankets...
...to protect your face...
...from flying glass and debris.
Before you do, remove
your eyeglasses and your shoes....
Remember, our biggest asset
in an emergency is calm, clear thinking.
All of us on the crew have been
carefully trained for emergencies....
Come on! Come on!
I'm late already. Don't quit on me now.
Come on! Come on!
Now what?
Somebody!
Is anybody out there?
Is anybody there?
What's the problem, pal?
Just stay calm everyone!
Everyone, please!
Stay calm! Please don't push!
Everyone, please!
Everything will be all right
if we just stay calm!
I can't move.
- I'm trapped.
- Get me out of here!
Mommy! Mommy!
Help! We're stuck!
Hold it. Hold it. Just a minute.
Please, Daddy!
Wake up, Daddy!
Please wake up.
Somebody's coming.
Hey, mister. Mister?
Can you give us a hand?
Hold on, buddy!
We're talking $1 00 shoes here.
Shit!
Shit!
Help us! Please!
The handle's jammed!
You've gotta push on the door!
- You've gotta push hard!
- What do you think I'm doing?
Harder! Again! Come on.
- Push!
- I'm pushing it.
- Harder!
- I'm pushing it, asshole!
Come on! One at a time!
Don't push!
When you get out, move as far away
from the plane as possible.
Please, one at a time.
One at a time, please.
Please, miss. My father can't move.
He can't move!
We'll try to help him.
Wait outside.
Move as far away from
the plane as you can.
One at a time. Let's go! Let's go!
There's a woman back there.
She's trapped!
You get as far away
from the plane as you can.
Daddy!
Where's my shoes?
Where are my shoes?
Daddy, please!
Sir, please!
My dad can't move!
Where? Where is he?
In there. He's hurt!
The cops are coming and the firemen.
They got equipment and stuff.
They're experts.
Where are my shoes?
Please, sir. Please.
It's on fire. He can't move.
Oh, for chrissake.
What's his name?
- Fletcher! Where are you?
- You can't come back in.
Where are you, fella?
Are you Fletcher?
Who are you?
Come on.
Hey! Somebody grab him, will you?
Help this guy, will you?
- Help him!
- Get him!
Get him away from the plane!
Get as far away from
the plane as you can!
Where are you? Hey, buddy.
Goddamn it!
Fletcher, speak up.
Don't be an asshole.
Oh, shit.
My leg is caught.
My leg is caught.
Can you get me out of here?
Oh, sure. Yeah, I think.
Let me help you there.
Give me a hand, lady.
I'm not a goddamn bodybuilder.
Get away from the plane quickly.
It may explode!
Give me a hand here, will you, honey?
Move this piece of shit
out of here now.
Come on!
Dad!
- Dad!
- Son.
Thank God!
Look out! It's ready to go!
- Put her on your shoulder.
- You better get out of here!
- You too, miss.
- Fletcher!
I've lost count.
- Right away!
- I think everybody's out.
Where are you?
Here! I'm over here. Help me.
- Where are you?
- Here.
- Where?
- My leg is broken. I need help.
- Fletcher, right?
- Smith.
- You're not Fletcher?
- I'm Smith. Please help me.
Fuck this!
I'm looking for Fletcher.
No, don't leave me!
Please don't leave me.
Oh, all right.
Come here.
- Hold on. Come on.
- Oh, thank God.
Don't count your chickens, Smith.
I can't see shit!
Come out!
It's ready to blow!
- There's another guy in there!
- Right goddamn now!
- Hey, you!
- Get out of there!
Hey, you! Give me a hand here.
Come here!
- I'll help him.
- I got this guy.
I'll help him. You run for it.
- There's a guy in there!
- She's gonna explode!
There's a guy--
You're supposed to be a fireman!
She's gonna go!
Come on!
Get back! It's gonna go!
Come on, you stupid shit!
I lost my other shoe.
Get back!
-I need a medic here!
- Yes. Yes. Angle on fireman.
Jonesy!
Heroic. Backlit.
Blazing inferno! Look at that.
Awesome!
Major awards.
He stands his ground,
capturing images of raging flames...
...with no regard for
his own personal safety.
Go, Chucky.
Go, baby.
Sorry, Fletcher.
What a way to go, pal.
I'm okay.
- You're not okay.
- I'm a reporter.
- She's got a broken arm.
- It's my leg. My leg hurts.
Chucky! Chucky!
Holy shit! It's Gayley. Gayley!
- Hold up.
- You were on the plane?
It's my story, Conk.
I did the research.
Get the attendant
who manned the door.
Also, some passenger pulled me out.
Talk to him!
- Then get to the hospital.
- She's a piece of work.
Unbelievable. '' It's my story.
I did the research''?
You wouldn't believe the shot I got.
Major award.
I start in this fireman's face.
Fantastic!
You know, sad but excited.
Where's my car?
My car was right here.
- Where's my--?
- Where are you hurt?
Where are you hurt?
Why don't we go over to the ambulance?
I don't need an ambulance. I'm looking
for my car. It must've burnt up.
You weren't in your car.
You've been in a plane crash.
Please! My daughter needs
medical attention.
- He waited for hours.
- You won't believe it.
- I'm tired of your bullshit!
- It's not my fault.
It's never your fault! Never, ever!
You screwed up my life
and now your son's.
And you'll never accept
responsibility for anything!
Is your friend, the fireman, here?
He had an emergency call.
A real emergency!
Why don't you let me in, instead of
waking up the whole neighbourhood?
If you let me talk,
I'll tell you what happened.
What happened is the same thing
that always happens.
You blew it. Only this time, you broke
your son's heart instead of mine.
He was looking forward to
going to the movies with his father.
And you let him down
Iike you let everyone down, always.
Did you take a mud bath?
That's what I'm trying to--
Shut up, Bernie!
Forget it. Let me talk to Joey
to apologize.
He's in bed. And you won't wake him up
and make him crazy. Understand?
He comes home and wants to know
if Elliott's a war hero, like you.
- He wants to know how many you killed.
- Elliott? Elliott, the fireman.
I had to explain your tendency
to exaggerate.
How you killed as many people as
the other supply clerks in your outfit.
- I didn't say I killed anyone.
- Whatever! You let him believe it!
Then I had to explain
about the homeless.
How not all of them own
apartment complexes.
How not all of them
play the stock market.
How not all of them rent babies
when panhandling.
He's a young boy, Bernie.
Impressionable!
Listen, Ev, it's important.
- I gotta see him.
- Use the phone.
- I've got important reasons.
- He'd love to hear from you.
What happened to your shoe?
No, I don't wanna know.
Some fantastic adventure, right?
Something really crazy?
All I was doing was
giving him advice.
Preparing him for life.
You don't want him to grow up soft,
do you? It's tough out there.
It's a goddamn jungle.
Well, back to the jungle, Bernie.
Sorry, Ev, to bother you again.
This is for Joey.
A reward...
...for this wallet he found.
When I returned it, I told the guy
that he had to give my kid something...
...for finding it.
You know, for the honesty.
So the kid would learn how honesty pays.
Do you want to give it to him,
or should I?
Moron.
You actually went into
a burning aeroplane?
Into it? I was practically
living in the goddamn thing.
Into it? I was practically
living in the goddamn thing.
Every time I turned,
someone wants me to save them.
I couldn't see a foot in front of me.
Then suddenly...
...boom! It explodes.
I could be dead.
But you pulled people out.
You're a hero.
No, I fucked it up.
I was trying to impress this kid.
I was gonna rescue his old man but I
couldn't find him. He must've blew up.
I got out of there.
I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
A lot of people wouldn't have tried.
It was a brave thing.
Yeah, try stupid.
Just toss them in the back, please.
A lot of people would say
that's what heroism is...
...stupidity.
Doing something that,
if you thought about it...
...you wouldn't do it.
It's not in your interest.
One more.
All right. Is everything all right?
I guess you kind of got
a drinking problem.
I sell them at the recycling centre.
It gives me a bit for gas and food.
Looks like you live in here.
I do in bad weather.
But mostly, I like
camping in the woods.
I thought you were
down on your luck too.
'' Down on my luck''? I told you.
A goddamn plane fell on me...
...from out of the sky, in America,
for chrissake.
See these shoes? $1 00 pair
of shoes. One shoe.
- Give it to someone with one leg.
- One leg? Let me off. I'll take a bus.
I know a man who sells stuff
at the recycling centre.
He only has one leg.
I think it's the right foot.
Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks.
It pays for the gas.
He doesn't have any money.
It's very kind of you.
'' Down on my luck.''
I got some mud on me is all.
I got a nice apartment, stereo.
We could listen to you on the news.
Are you worried about
the stock market?
No, the plane crash.
Didn't they interview you?
I don't give no interviews.
That's a lot of shit.
Keep a low profile.
That's my motto.
I got legal problems. My attorneys
don't like me talking to the media.
Step on it. I'm supposed to be
in my office five minutes ago.
My secretary...
...has got appointments
booked for me, you know, all day.
I'm very late.
One word. One word, LaPlante,
and you're fired. You got that?
- Bill--
- Don't say '' BilI'' !
Didn't I say,
''One word and you're fired''?
Know why? Because it'll be an excuse.
'' Bernie LaPlante, excuse number 4, 1 06.''
No, 4, 1 1 2. That's how many
excuses you've given me.
I keep track of them electronically.
- I got legal problems.
- You talked! You're fired!
Out of here! Out of here!
Jesus Christ!
I got people waiting.
I got orders coming in.
And you, you're gonna
go out like that?
Meet the public in
stocking fucking feet?
I have problems.
I don't care about your problems.
I care about mine...
...and you're one of my problems.
Now get out!
I was driving my car--
I don't want to hear anymore.
- A plane fell on my head.
- Yeah, I'll be on your head.
I don't understand.
You can't find him?
There's a lot of confusion
around what took place, Gale.
But you said all the passengers
were accounted for.
The guy who pulled you out
wasn't a passenger.
A fireman, a paramedic?
He didn't have a uniform.
From what we could get,
there's a kind of...
...sort of, a mystery guy involved.
We're piecing together
different accounts.
A mystery guy.
Not a passenger. Who?
We don't know who he is. He....
He disappeared.
A non-passenger, non-rescue worker...
...went into a burning plane...
...and pulled me out and disappeared?
This guy's the one who
opened the emergency exit...
...from the outside.
Saved everyone on the plane.
Because of him, no fatalities.
I don't think you should be
moving around like that.
Chucky, where's your camera?
Get this thing.
- Bring that.
- Easy.
All of a sudden...
...this civilian
rushes into the plane.
What did he look like?
It was just this face, all dirty.
It just appeared.
He was asking for Mr. Fletcher.
My son and I got separated in...
...the confusion and smoke.
The very courageous stewardess
told me my boy had gotten out.
So I got out too.
But my son had already
told this man...
... that I was still in there.
I thought my dad was still...
...still in there. So I asked
the man to save my father.
What did the man say, Richie?
He said....
He said:
'' I'll save him.'' He said,
'' I'll save your father.''
Thanks.
I need a medic here!
I need a medic!
Jonesy!
-Shit!
- Now freeze. Go back, you missed it.
Keep going, keep going.
Back.
Now, go forward again.
Missed it again.
There.
Right there.
That's him?
Who else? We've accounted
for everybody else.
- That's our hero.
- I didn't even notice him.
I was into the foreground drama.
Heroic fireman, looming in the frame.
Can we do some kind of
electronic enhancement?
Get a clear picture?
Identify him?
Far out.
Never saw him.
It's the camera.
It has a life of its own.
At times I feel as if we were one,
capturing little moments...
...of history in a kaleidoscope...
...of colours and drama.
There's no face.
There's nothing to work with.
Big dots. That's all
you're gonna get.
Look at that guy.
He just saved 54 people.
And now he's gonna disappear.
Who is he?
''I'll save him. ''
He said, ''I'll save your father. ''
All of a sudden, this civilian...
...he rushed into the plane.
Leslie, the other flight attendant,
told me the guy dragged me...
... to the exit.
''Here, give this guy
a hand, '' he said.
And the next thing I knew...
...he was going back in there.
Into all that smoke.
Out of the darkness.
Out of the smoke...
...and the fear,
came a man with no name.
No uniform...
...but an abundance of courage.
A man who was thinking not about
himself, but about others.
Risking his own life for ours.
He's out there now, somewhere...
...and whoever you are...
...I and the other survivors
of Flight 1 04 say...
... thank you. God bless you.
If you're gonna wear a cast, feature
it more. It's part of the story.
Network wants to feed off our 6:00...
...whether we find the guy or not.
It's a wonderful piece.
Emotional. I love it.
We'll feature Gale's cast.
My cast is only interesting until
the hero shows up.
Then whoever has him, has the story.
Good reason for you
to find him.
You should be out digging.
We could help her out.
How about offering a reward?
In return for
an exclusive interview.
Money and news. Dangerous waters.
He's right. We don't even
know what he looks like.
Of course you know what he looks like.
He saved you, right?
They found what?
A phone check with survivors has
confirmed that the shoe...
... does not belong to any of
the passengers or crew of Flight 1 04.
However, several witnesses recall
the mysterious man...
... who saved 54 people, referring
to his missing shoe.
The conclusion is...
... the unknown hero, known to many
as the Angel of Flight 1 04...
-... wears a size 1 0B.
- Joey!
Dinner, now!
Turn that thing off!
Mom! Mom!
He lost his shoe!
He lost his shoe!
- He lost his shoe.
- Who did?
The unknown hero.
Wash your hands.
They found his shoe right beside
the plane crash.
Superman, you mean? Lost his shoe?
What next?
Elliott, the man saved
hundreds of people.
Fifty-four.
I was there, remember?
You know why none of us
rushed in that plane?
Because we're trained firemen,
that's why.
Part of a team, a disciplined team.
We take chances all the time,
save people's lives.
But we don't do crazy things.
This guy does something
really dumb and he lucks out.
So the media go crazy over
his shoe, for God's sakes!
What message are they
giving to the youth?
What message are you
giving to the youth?
Sneering at someone
for sticking his neck out.
You sound like my ex,
for heaven's sake. Mr. Cynicism.
So what can I say?
Give your ex credit for being smart
enough not to do something stupid.
Maybe the guy's not all bad.
I'm gonna watch TV and hope it's not
all this ''Superman'' stuff.
My father only had one shoe on...
...when he came here.
You were in bed, weren't you?
I saw him out the window.
You think he would do
something like that?
Rescue people?
Your father is Bernie LaPlante.
It's against his religion
to stick his neck out.
Sit down.
The warden of a Montana prison
insists the unknown hero...
... is a child molester who escaped
from the institution in April.
In Scotland, the leader of
a religious sect claims...
... the mysterious hero is, in fact,
an angel anticipated in scripture.
Hey, Bernie!
- How's it going?
- You don't wanna know.
You don't wanna know.
Those guys been in yet?
You in business with
them guys or what?
I wouldn't want a
problem for the bar.
You couldn't have a problem...
...because I personally have got
them all. I cornered the whole market.
You wouldn't believe what
I've been through.
You know, I was taking my car
to get my kid--
How you doing?
- Brought some friends, okay?
- Yeah, sure.
Excuse me, Chick.
In addition, we bring you
a special announcement from...
... Channel 4, station manager...
...James Wallace.
Good evening.
We at Channel 4, like you,
have been...
...stirred by the courage
and the humanity....
Mi amigo. What do you got?
More plastic?
Yeah, plastic.
Premium stuff here. High limits.
Not reported.
How do you know?
Because I know. Trust me on this.
Hombre, he don't trust
his mother. Why you?
Because I'm not his mother.
Por aqui?
But then again, like you...
... we want to see what is best in us.
We want to examine it.
For that reason, we at
Channel 4 will offer...
... this unknown hero
a reward of $1 million.
How many of these you got?
Eight? Ten?
They're gonna give that
guy $1 million.
- Who?
- That plane crash guy.
- A million bucks?
- That's right.
- Is this all of them, 8?
- What plane crash guy?
The one-shoe dude.
The guy that saved those people.
Channel 4's gonna give
this guy $1 million...
...just for an interview!
A million bucks!
Hombre! We're trying to
do some business here.
- You got more of these?
- A million dollars?
I'm the guy.
I got an appointment.
I gotta--
Bullshit!
LaPlante, you're under arrest!
You have the right--
Don't you know who I am?
Where I got the plastic?
I got a million bucks
from the jet!
Bullshit! I got a million bucks!
One million dollars
to anonymous hero!
One million bucks to angel
who saved 50 people takes off!
Now, please! If your foot isn't a
size 1 0B, don't remain in line!
We're only looking for size 1 0B heroes!
Me, a liar?
I'll kick your ass!
It ain't just me saying you
ain't the hero!
Everybody in line
knows you're not the hero!
That's a racist perspective.
Assuming because something heroic
was done, a white man done it.
A man with mud on his face
could be a man of any colour.
Most likely was, which is true
in this case...
...because it was me!
With mud all over me!
Can you believe this?
There must be a thousand
phonies here after my reward!
Miss Gayley! It's me!
The guy who saved your life!
It's me, remember?
I'm only an 8 1 I2, but I wear
a 1 0 for comfort, I swear!
A cop's here
for you from robbery detail.
Inspector Dayton.
He wants you to call.
- What about?
- I didn't ask.
Call back and find out, okay?
I'm really busy!
Bail in this matter will
remain at $5,000.
Next!
The Angel of Flight 1 04?
You're the angel--
Angel? I didn't say angel.
I gotta get over to the TV station
and get my million.
- Mr. LaPlante--
- The People vs. LaPlante.
That's me! I'm Mr. LaPlante!
The D.A. is asking that
your bail be set...
...at $25,000.
$25,000!
Because you were arrested again.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts! You
just gotta get me out to collect--
Your honour! The prosecutor
wants $25,000 for bail.
You will be silent until
the court recognizes you.
Fine by me.
I got no problem with that.
In fact, your honour, I'd be
proud to double it.
Fifty grand. For The People.
Like a tip.
- Mr. LaPlante--
- What do you say?
If you don't stop chattering
immediately, I will ask the bailiff--
I said I want...
...order! !
- Sorry, sir.
- We got carried away.
- They found him!
- Found who?
The Angel of Flight 1 04.
It was on the news, sir.
Just now.
He's gonna be on Channel 4 at noon.
We'll sustain the bail at $25,000.
That ought to keep you
out of trouble.
- Your honour, my client is--
- Your client is a pain in the ass!
Twelve noon, huh? Channel 4.
I was out in the woods...
...and I heard a huge crash.
And I saw...
...flames.
And I went over there
to take a look.
And everything there was...
...like a blur.
There was a lot of smoke...
...and screaming.
I was relieved that it was just
a plane crash, and I could help.
But I don't have a detailed
memory of it. It was too scary.
Tell us why you disappeared, John.
Well, that's--
At first, I didn't know
I was the hero. I thought...
... the boy's father hadn't survived...
...and I had failed him
and I couldn't....
I couldn't face the boy.
And then...
...after that...
... well, I've been....
I've been down on my luck lately.
I just didn't really feel
too presentable.
But finally, you did come forward.
Why?
The money.
I wouldn't have come forward
if it wasn't for...
-... if it wasn't for the money.
- Go back.
Cut!
Right there.
Right on that look.
You didn't tell me he
was so cute.
He saved my life.
The survivors were shocked to learn
that the hero who appeared...
...and pulled them to safety
was indigent...
...and hadn't slept in a bed
in more than three years.
John Bubber was living in his car
at the time of the crash.
Eking out a meagre existence
by collecting cans....
- He's a fake.
- You know him?
He's a goddamn fake.
He's a bum.
He's a goddamn homeless bum!
He ain't no hero.
You can trust me on that.
Trust you!
What do you mean,
cutting down the homeless?
What do you know about the homeless?
You know, I thought they'd all go,
'' It's him!'' and wanna hug the guy.
Relax. He had the shoe,
and the shoe checked out.
I can stop worrying?
Where are we putting him up?
Drake Hotel.
And never stop worrying.
We'll do a sidebar on going from
sleeping in your car...
...to sleeping in a posh suite.
Also, Gale's checking into
his background.
What's it gonna be?
Dirt or more poetry?
We know which one you'd prefer.
Inspector Dayton recovered
your credit cards--
- Who?
- Inspector Dayton, from robbery detail.
They caught the guy
who stole your credit cards--
Nobody stole them.
They were burned up.
You got my money?
What about the reservations?
Two at 8, at the Barcelona.
- Four hundred dollars for dinner?
- She's taking Mr. Bubber to dinner.
Bubber? To dinner?
That's a great idea! Chucky!
- Come in here.
- This is private and personal.
He's a news story, for Pete's sake.
He saved my life.
Thank you.
- They're all looking at us.
- Not '' us,'' John.
They're used to celebrities.
- Listen, Miss Gayley. I really--
- Gale.
Gale...
...I didn't mean to....
It's not what I wanted, that reward.
I didn't think--
Thank you.
All I wanted was a square meal,
maybe a bath...
...clean sheets.
I wasn't after $1 million.
Twenty would've been fine.
Maybe fifty, but--
What's a guy like me gonna do
with $1 million?
Look at these prices
and say that.
I'll cut your heart out and eat it!
- Sit down, man!
- Get off of me!
Oh, you're such a brute.
Come on! You got some shit
to say to me? Come on!
You're dead shit, mother--
Very good, sir.
It's a special privilege to serve you.
Oh, thank you. And you.
You were saying you don't want
$1 million?
I'm not entitled to $1 million, Gale.
I didn't expect--
The adulation?
Makes you feel like a fake.
I should've never come forward--
You're a credit to
the goddamn human race.
I wouldn't put it--
It could've been me on that plane.
Or my family.
You're a celebrity now.
People are gonna want to please you...
...or use you, or both.
Mr. Bubber, can we get a statement?
John, I think you're the greatest!
Mr. Bubber?
Do you think you could...
...you could...?
You want me to sign this?
What's your name?
- Sylvia.
- Sylvia?
Sylvia, if I sign this for you,
will you do me a favour?
What I'd like is, and maybe...
...some of the rest of you
could help Sylvia.
I'd like you to scrounge up
some blankets...
...old ones, maybe 50.
Take them down to the corner
of Fifth and Grand.
Pass them out.
- Fifth and Grand?
- Yes.
He means the homeless.
The bums.
It's cold out there.
You'll feel warmer for every person
you give a blanket to.
I bet they'll do it.
I bet they'll get some blankets.
What you did was so uplifting.
You're a saint.
Do you think so?
Well, maybe you should up...
...up the support
for the needy, troubled people.
I think she could support
the entire Chicago Bulls.
- Good night.
- Good night!
I think I'd better see you
to your room.
Kind of a bodyguard.
Could you maybe...
...support a small airfield?
It's been some time since
I've received that kind of attention.
It's been years.
- Years?
- Yes.
There'll be plenty of opportunities.
You're a very nice person.
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- I know.
You think I saved your life.
I can't take advantage.
You did save my life. And it's me.
I'd be taking advantage.
I'm a reporter.
I'm supposed to be a professional.
I can't do this.
It's not right.
I don't have the right.
You're a news story.
''A news story.'' Right.
Good night.
I know the truth about you.
I'm flying in some guys from
your unit in Vietnam.
Vietnam?
Good night.
Smoke...
...mortar fire, people screaming.
We would've all died that day
in that rice paddy...
... in Vietnam,
if it hadn't been for Johnny Bubber.
Why? What did he do?
He pulled us out.
He pulled us out, one by one.
I wouldn't be giving no TV interview.
I'd be in my grave.
A guy with his name on the wall...
... in D. C.,
if it hadn't been for Johnny.
Why didn't he get a medal?
Wasn't no officers around
to witness it and write him up.
It didn't surprise me that he saved
all those people on the plane.
He always thought about others,
before himself.
After an emotional reunion...
... veterans watched as station manager,
James Wallace presented Bubber...
... with a check for $1 million.
As Bubber reacted to
his sudden wealth...
... word came that
the Secretary of the Navy...
...responding to a resolution
of the Senate...
...has conferred upon John Bubber
the Medal of Honour.
When you're out on the streets...
... living in your car...
... the worst thing,
worse than cold or hunger...
... is the feeling that
you're plain useless.
You don't matter to a single soul
in the entire world.
Nobody really needs you,
and nobody really wants you.
So I guess I...
...I did what I did...
...because I was really trying to
save my life more than anything else.
Trying to connect myself
with people again...
... to be a part of the whole.
And you have to help others
in order to do that.
You need a role, even if it's a
humble role. It gives you self-worth.
I'm not one of those
who says money's not important.
It's very important, especially when
you're down and out on your luck...
... like I was. A buck can be
the difference between life and death...
...but, at the same time,
money isn't everything.
Is he like that in real life?
So gorgeous?
He's pretty remarkable.
You didn't get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter.
Oh, what? Reporters don't
have hormones?
Reporters have to rise above
their hormones.
-After that, he needs to be a person.
- The guy is a natural.
He needs to be part of society.
You can be that by helping others.
You need to help those
who need help.
You've helped me.
You've made me a hero.
That makes you a hero.
If we help each other,
we can all be heroes.
We're all heroes, huh?
Asshole.
LaPlante, Bernard.
- LaPlante.
- Me?
- We made bail, ace.
- You lucky!
- Me?
- Come on.
Lucky they're taking your raggedy ass
out of here!
If bail wasn't reduced, how--?
I took a loan on my car
and my computer.
You paid a bondsman 1 0% ?
I was inspired by the hero.
How he stuck his neck out for others,
and took a chance and....
That fake inspired you to loan me,
a guy fired off his job, $2,500?
A guy who'll probably do time?
You're an attorney.
You should use good judgment.
As you like to point out,
I am relatively inexperienced.
My naivet worked to your benefit.
You're right. I'm glad.
You got me out. I appreciate it.
Oh, Miss O'Day.
Miss O'Day? Come here.
Now that you loaned me $2,500, can I
have $20 for cab fare? Please?
What do you say, Miss O'Day?
I read the probation report,
and it's not good.
I think you're going--
I think you're going to prison--
At least I'm gonna get
my million bucks.
I seen on TV where
that do-gooder's going...
...to a children's hospital.
Visit sick kids at 3:30.
He's a menace.
He's making people wacko.
Who, John Bubber?
Look what he's done to you.
He's making them wacko.
Wacko! Wacko! Wacko!
When's he coming?
I wanna see Bubber.
- Is that him?
- Is he here yet?
- It's just some guy.
- Excuse me? May I help you?
Leave. This ward is off-limits.
If you want to arrange a visit,
you can just go downstairs.
Hi. What's your name, champ?
- Jos.
- Hi, Jos.
- Hi, beautiful. What's your name?
- I'm Mandy.
What's your name?
Hi, Cody. I'll be back.
- Hey, Bubber!
- Can I get your autograph?
- Did you save all of those people?
- Yes! All those people!
- Excuse me. I just want to....
- You got a press pass?
No, I forgot it.
Get your hands off me!
- What do you need, an escort?
- I wanna talk to the guy.
Listen, kid.
You gotta hang on. I know
you're scared. We all get scared.
That's when you have to fight.
- Allen's in a coma. He can't hear you.
- He can hear me.
Listen, Allen.
Listen, Allen.
I know you're in the darkness
in there.
I know it's scary.
The doctors are trying...
...but they can't do it.
You have to do it.
You gotta come out of the darkness.
I want you to struggle for me, Allen.
You're a hero.
You can't quit.
Heroes never quit.
Come on, this is a hospital.
Let's cooperate.
Let's keep this area clear,
unless you have hospital business.
Come on, fella.
How's about some cooperation?
You're with the media, right?
I got a story here for you.
Bubber? He's a fake!
I'm talking to you!
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone crazy?
Remember me?
I love you, John Bubber!
You're a fake, Bubber!
You're a phony!
- Thanks for helping.
- I'm talking to you. You got my shoe!
That's my money!
I want my money!
You fake! You phony!
You hear me?
That's my shoe and my money!
You're a fake!
Come on. Up, up.
- Hey, watch it! You big bozo!
- Up and at 'em.
Don't tell me what I can
or cannot say. This is America.
If it makes you feel better
to insult the brave man...
...who's worth about
a thousand of you, go ahead.
Like he says, we're all heroes.
Even you.
Bullshit!
That's a lot of bullshit.
Okay, have it your own way.
You're not a hero.
John Bubber, himself...
...along with 20 of
the real survivors of Flight 1 04.
See real-life participants
reenact the terrifying drama...
... inside the burning plane.
Out of darkness, out of fire...
... out of a nightmare of fear,
came the Angel of Flight 1 04.
John Bubber saved 54 people.
This is his story and theirs.
A drama featuring the actual people...
... who actually lived
those moments of terror.
No makeup, no music, no actors.
This is the real thing.
Thursday night, Channel 4.
Be there.
- He's upset.
- Upset? What's he upset about?
He said he's not an actor.
He's not supposed to be an actor.
He's a real-life hero.
He just has to act like one.
That's the beauty of the concept,
the freshness of it.
Did she call him back?
She's talking to him now.
Wally.
Well, I mean, we paid him $1 million.
You'd think he'd want to cooperate
a little. Help us with our ratings.
- How did it go?
- Well, he'll do it.
You really should've
talked to him first.
Back in the news again, John Bubber.
The man who saved 54 people from a
burning plane, has awakened a young....
I don't blame you for being sore.
I know I screwed up
for getting busted in here.
You got a right to kick me out.
--had been unconscious since
an automobile accident five days ago.
John Bubber insisted on
talking to young Allen...
... even though doctors
discouraged it...
...saying the boy couldn't hear
Bubber's words.
I won't kick you out.
--suddenly and unexpectedly
regained consciousness.
The doctors, who believed
he had little chance of survival...
...now predict a slow,
but complete recovery.
Bubber waved away cameras
as he spoke....
Thanks, Chick.
I appreciate it.
Hell of a guy.
Vietnam...
...plane crash...
...now, miracles.
Allen has yet to comment.
A nurse who was with him says
his first words were...
... ''Could you ask my mom
to make me some pancakes?''
Just a rehearsal.
Action.
- John?
- What?
Come here. Come here.
And then you lean down,
and free me from the seat.
Remember? I was caught, and you....
Like that. Yeah. Right, like that.
And then you helped me up.
Boy, you seem taller.
Must be psychological,
now that I know you saved me.
I can't....
This is wrong. I can't do this.
- I can't go through with this.
- You're doing fine.
Wait. You didn't lift me, though.
Wait. Put me down.
Put me down.
Come on. It was more like
you supported me.
Here, like this.
Like that.
It was kind of sexy.
You can support me anytime, John.
This is no good.
Know what I just remembered?
You were swearing and talking
about bodybuilding.
- Bodybuilding?
- Guys, guys.
This has to play serious.
This was a serious thing.
Could you lift her more
and carry her like this?
That's right.
I think it'll play better.
Gale, if your artistic and journalistic
integrity can handle it...
...it'll look fabulous on-screen.
Take this through to the end.
We'll put John in his mud makeup,
and do a take from the top.
Boom, boom, boom. Right away.
This is not right.
It's okay. It just
looks better this way.
I didn't have my purse then, though.
You're an inspiration, John.
You're making us better human beings.
Less cynical...
...more open, more giving.
Do you realize that?
Oh, my goodness.
Then you leave her here,
and you go back inside for Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith?
Right.
Mr. Smith?
What would you say if I said
I ran into a plane...
...and saved a bunch of people
and risked my life?
You mean like Bubber?
The hero?
Like that. Same thing.
Well, I mean....
What do you want me to say here?
Is this a riddle or something?
I mean...
...if I said it...
...would you believe me?
You wouldn't, would you?
Well, I mean, it's a character thing.
You wouldn't do it.
No offense. Me neither.
Bubber, though. He's a certain
kind of guy. He's heroic.
You and me, we're not heroic.
It's not our nature.
Don't mean we're bad.
We're just not so inclined.
What about it?
You don't have to be a hero
to be a human being.
- The thing is, Chick, I'm going down.
- Down?
You mean jail,
for that credit card stuff?
- Jesus, Bernie.
- Not jail, prison.
And not that credit card bullshit.
I got a conviction.
Sentencing tomorrow.
Some cases of paint
I got involved with.
Latex.
I see this probation officer...
...he writes a letter to the judge,
says I'm...
...''antisocial.''
''AntisociaI''?
Jesus, Bernie. How much paint
are we talking about?
A lot.
We've all done something
very important.
Congratulations. Thank you.
Excellent job. Good work.
Take care of that arm.
Bye-bye, Gale.
Okay, nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Keep studying.
You'll be a big actress one day.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Powerful stuff. Very powerful.
- Bill Dayton.
Thank you so much. Let's keep in touch.
Let's keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
What's that about?
Can we talk somewhere?
Oh, my goodness.
Let me get that gunk off your face.
Mr. Bubber. John?
Would you sign Kelly's Bubber doll?
Bubber doll?
It won't take more than
1 0 minutes of your time.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
So, how does this, what's his name,
the sleazebag, say he got my cards?
Bernard LaPlante?
This bozo got more stories
than a newspaper.
And one of them, he says
he's the Angel of Flight 1 04.
Pulls you off, saves your purse
and forgets to return it.
That's version 63. Version 64,
he says he kept it to pay for his...
...hundred-dollar shoes.
He's a two-bit bullshit artist.
Already got a sentence pending
for dealing stolen goods.
Listen.
This guy, the hero...
...Bubber?
He was a homeless guy, right?
I mean, he was down on his luck.
He couldn't have swiped your purse...
...while rescuing you
and sold it to LaPlante?
John Bubber risks his life to save me
and 54 others and swipes my purse?
Too far-fetched?
Listen, I'm not trying to make
problems for John Bubber.
I just wanna make sure LaPlante
does meaningful time.
Tell me more about him.
Homework. You're doing your homework,
remember?
Homework, homework, homework.
No homework, no zoo trips, no movies.
He's doing his homework.
It's your father. Talk to him,
or he'll call all night.
Hey, Joey. How you doing?
It's me, your old man.
Did you get the $20?
What? Well, she's right on that.
That's the best place for it.
A college fund.
I was gonna tell you that myself.
About how I didn't show up
the other night. I just--
What? You seen me out the window?
One shoe, yeah, and the mud.
So you thought I might've been
the heroic guy?
And what'd she say when you--
''Against my religion,'' huh?
This kind of stuff, we gotta
talk about it sometime, man to man.
Listen now, I gotta go away now
on this business trip.
So I won't be seeing you for a while.
You gotta listen to your mother...
...because she's smart.
She's very smart.
She knows what's best for you.
It ain't because I don't like you.
Christ! I mean, not Christ.
You know...
...I don't wanna go away
on this business trip.
I love you. But I gotta.
That's part of growing older.
It's all these goddamn,
pardon the expression...
...business things you have to do.
Which reminds me, you know
this hero business?
One of the things you'll learn
as you grow...
...as you grow older, is that life
gets very complicated.
Weird, actually. It's, you know....
People aren't exactly like they seem.
Nothing is.
Life gets unbelievable.
This is normal as you grow older.
I would've seen you that night--
I was talking to Joey.
Your son actually wants
to spend time with you.
If you let him down this time
after popping back into his life--
You got to understand.
It's this business trip.
And please don't hang up.
Wait a second, Ev.
Please. Wait a minute.
Just let me say one thing.
Look, I know I kind of act like
an asshole sometimes. I know that.
I know you were a good...
...wife.
I know I fucked it up.
I had a good thing. I blew it.
I just--
I just want you to know
that I know that.
That's all.
Okay, I gotta go now.
Business trip, yeah. Be a while.
Okay?
I'm sorry. Sorry I took so much time.
Bernard!
Hey, LaPlante!
Open the door!
Television interview.
Fame and fortune.
I hope the bastard didn't kill himself.
He's been very upset
about this sentence that he got.
He's going to prison.
Is that a camera? If he killed himself,
you could take pictures.
Too bad, no dead body.
It's not often that you get pictures
of the body before the cops get here.
Exclusive.
Mr. Winston, I wonder if you'd mind
if we waited here?
What's he gonna do? Sue?
He's lucky that a person like yourself,
that a celebrity like yourself...
...would want to even
take an interest in him when--
What did he do? A drug thing?
We're not free to say.
Of course. I understand.
It's confidential.
It's personal.
Well, I'll watch it on television.
All right.
What are we doing?
This guy could be hours.
Maybe. I have a feeling
he's important somehow.
I know you're this career-fiend,
but I've got a wife and family.
Well, you're lucky, Chucky.
What's the matter?
This sofa.
What is it?
The Silver Mike Award.
How did a guy like LaPlante
get an award?
'' For Excellence
in the Pursuit of Truth.''
LaPlante?
Camera, Chucky.
- Are you Bernard LaPlante?
- What the--?
What's your relationship with Bubber?
You?
- How did you acquire this?
- How do you think?
- Put that down.
- What's your scheme?
What are you trying to do?
He's gonna jump! Bubber's gonna jump!
It's on Channel 1 3.
1 3!
Officials of the fire department say
they cannot rig a net below him.
They're afraid it'll trigger
his decision to jump.
Oh, my God!
He'll only talk with Gale Gayley.
- The phone. Quick!
- The phone is over here.
He's green, for chrissake.
No shit.
- You took advantage of me. It's shit!
- Hold it, you bozo.
Adjust it.
Don't touch that, scumbag!
You'll screw it up more!
For God's sake,
tell him I'm on my way.
Let's go. A police escort's
gonna pick us up en route.
You too. You're coming with me.
If you don't,
I'll have the cops pick you up.
What kind of bullshit is this?
Is this America or--?
Here. 20, 35....
What have you got?
Give Mr. LaPlante your money.
Come on, let's go.
You media people. You think
you can just buy people cheap?
That's all I have.
A bigtime cameraman like you?
That's all you got?
My fault?
This nutcase goes out on a ledge--
If anything happens to John Bubber,
Mr. LaPlante, I will see you prosecuted.
What, is everybody
in love with this bozo?
Yes, everybody is in love with him.
And they're not gonna be happy
if he dies because he was blackmailed--
I blackmailed this wacko?
The cops don't know, but
it doesn't mean you're home free.
I'm a veteran reporter. I've seen your
kind before, the underbelly of crime.
In all that smoke and flame,
John had a moment of weakness.
He was destitute.
It was an impulse, stealing my purse.
Stole your purse while saving you?
You gotta be kidding me.
And sold it to Mr. LaPlante,
who is now blackmailing John.
He's nuts. He saves those people,
then he swipes your purse?
Because he was a real hero.
He didn't expect a reward
or to be lionized by the press.
He saved 54 people because
something made him go into that plane...
...when his sense
told him otherwise.
He settled for a few credit cards
that he sold for what?
A couple of bucks?
To give him enough for a decent meal?
All this is off the record, Chucky.
If John lives, LaPlante
will offer his assurances.
There'll be no more
misbehaviour on his part.
And what's more,
he's going to apologize.
I'm gonna apologize to Bubber?
I could deny I had
those cards on the plane.
Lie, you mean?
Maybe I'll tell the story
the way I just did.
Everybody will understand John Bubber
is an even bigger hero.
And you are the lowest fucking
thing that ever crawled.
Your name's gonna be synonymous
with cynical opportunism.
You're not gonna get a cent.
I got a kid. I'm a person.
For your child's sake...
...rise above it! Show some decency!
You may have killed him already.
Come on! Come on!
Right there, pal.
It's okay! He belongs to me.
Come on!
Go away!
He's mine! Mine!
That was Gale Gayley being escorted
into the hotel by police officers.
Gale, who was rescued
from the plane crash by John Bubber...
...has a special relationship
with the Angel of Flight 1 04.
Now, as to what she might be
doing here at the hotel--
He'll only talk to you,
and he won't move any closer.
Just lean out.
We'll hold you from behind.
Excuse me, fellows.
Give us some room, guys.
Let her in there. Let her in there.
John?
John, I'm here.
Don't do it. Everything's okay.
Gale?
I want you to know
I never meant to hurt you.
This is for you.
It'll explain.
John, I know the whole story.
You do?
Oh, my God, John!
It's okay! It's nothing!
It was a moment of weakness!
A little mistake.
People understand.
- A little mistake?
- You're too hard on yourself.
I have him here. The little creep
who's trying to blackmail you!
Hold on! Hold on!
Come here! Come on!
Get out of there!
I just want to talk to him!
Bubber! Come here!
I got to talk to you, buddy.
LaPlante!
Come on. Don't be an asshole.
I don't like heights.
I'm sorry. It's all in my letter
to Miss Gayley. I was all wrong.
Turn that off!
You want him to jump?
Go on, get out of here! Both of you!
I just want to talk to you, and then you
can jump. Jump twice for all I care.
You can talk from there.
They got cameras and
all that crap in there. Microphones.
There is someone out
on the ledge with Bubber.
A rescue specialist of some kind
from the police or fire department.
He's moving--
He's moving toward Bubber.
Crawling. He does not appear
to have a safety rope tied to him...
...and the fire department has....
I'm sorry. You didn't want publicity
because of your legal problems.
I didn't say
I don't want a million.
I didn't expect them to go for it.
You didn't come forward.
They investigated my record.
I kept expecting you to expose me.
Where you been?
I was in jail, for chrissake!
This is crazy.
We could fall off of here.
You should go inside.
You're risking your life again.
I'm beginning to
be aware of that, John.
Listen, I'm not gonna do
nothing heroic here.
You can trust me on that, buddy. Now...
...why don't we sit down for a while?
You know, you could, like...
...rest up for the jump.
What have I done?
I was dirt-poor and useless,
but I was honest.
Lighten up, John. You think
you got problems? For chrissake!
I'm the guy with the problems.
We still don't know why John Bubber...
...hero to the nation,
stepped out onto the ledge...
... 1 5 stories above the street
more than an hour ago.
But we now have the identity of the man
who has been talking to him...
...at great personal risk.
He has been identified
as Bernard LaPlante....
Mom!
It's my father!
Bernie?
He's one of your clients?
LaPlante, you crazy bastard!
LaPlante?
I'm gonna grab some high ground,
get a hot overhead angle.
LaPlante seems to have persuaded
John Bubber to sit down...
...and the two men seem to be
engrossed in conversation.
What they're
saying at this moment....
It is him.
What's he doing up there, Mom?
Where's your coat? Get your coat.
- -good sign, since he has not jumped.
He says that if a man
doesn't jump immediately...
...there is a chance
he won't jump at all.
A man who's an expert
lip-reader reports...
...that John and Bernard are discussing
religion as they sit on the ledge.
You stole her purse
while you were saving her?
What's the big deal?
You pretended you were me.
A moment of weakness, right?
So I swiped her purse.
I got feet of clay too, buddy.
Now she thinks you're blackmailing me?
She don't like me, John.
And she ain't alone.
I guess it's kind
of a personality thing.
Look at those maniacs down there.
They love you, for chrissake.
I can't face those people now.
The looks in their eyes
after their trust.
Great. You make this goddamn mess,
and then you jump. Beautiful.
At the hospital, I've seen you with
those bastards. Pardon my vulgarity.
It was you.
I'm not saying I hate
sick people or anything.
But I hate being around them,
if you know what I mean.
There you go, you inspire
this kid to live.
I probably would have vomited on him.
Allen? Allen's okay?
See what I mean?
You remember his name, for chrissake.
But you're the guy who got
those people out of the plane.
You would've gone in there.
You wouldn't have thought twice.
That's the kind of guy you are.
Trust me on that.
So what do we do?
The blackmail thing
don't sound like a bad idea.
- What do you mean?
- You still got some money.
You didn't spend all the dough, did you?
What are you getting at?
The TV lady thinks I'm blackmailing you
because you swiped her purse.
She thinks I know it, because you sold
it before you heard about the million.
What she don't know is that
I really am going to blackmail you...
...because I swiped her purse,
because it was me on the plane.
- You see what I mean?
- You want me not to jump.
And keep on lying and pay you
to keep your mouth shut?
You are crazy. Why?
Because I don't need your problems.
All this TV bullshit.
These fans. I just want some
of the money, not even all of it.
Here's what I got in mind.
What do you mean?
I want to know everything!
Who's this screwball LaPlante,
for Pete's sake?
What the hell are those
two bozos chattering about?
You can't hear them? Read their lips!
You're a reporter. lmprovise.
This is not a news story.
This is real life!
'' Real life?'' Jesus Christ, Gale!
Don't crack up on me now.
Why would I? I'm a professional.
I'm a cynical, hard-bitten,
professional hard-ass, aren't I?
A cold, ambitious bitch or something?
Isn't that what everybody says?
No, you are none of those things.
You're a goddamn cream puff.
You're a marshmallow.
That's why everybody loves you.
Try and be a professional marshmallow.
And get out there and report
the goddamn human drama!
John!
I quit, Deak.
You can't! It's unprofessional!
I don't know why he's there.
Maybe he misses you.
He wanted to see you.
I wouldn't let him.
Maybe it's my fault.
He's all alone. He's getting older--
- I thought you hated him.
- No.
He just makes me angry.
He's selfish and self-centred...
- ...and cynical.
- What's ''cynicaI''?
It's when you say, '' Everybody else
cheats, why shouldn't I?''
He does have his good side.
It's just hidden.
When you were in the hospital...
...and you had your appendix out...
...he stayed the whole night long,
and he hates hospitals!
It just seems your father is at his best
when there's a crisis.
When something goes really wrong
or there's some kind of emergency...
...he just forgets to be Bernie LaPlante
and acts sort of like...
...a human being.
Look!
Oh, God, what is it?
Something's going on.
He seems to be...
... calling out to them.
And now he's holding up two fingers.
He's signaling something.
Holding up two fingers.
There are firemen
leaning out the window.
-They have what appear to be poles--
- What's happening?
There's something at the tip
of the poles. It looks like....
It looks like-- I think it's....
Wait a minute. I have a report here.
Coffee. It's coffee.
We're told that Bubber and LaPlante
asked for two cups--
It's just like your father to request
something totally inappropriate.
Thousands of people are watching,
and he wants coffee.
We have just learned that LaPlante
is a convicted felon...
... due to be sentenced
for trafficking in stolen goods.
Gale should have aired that bit first.
She found this clown LaPlante.
She let Channel 8 get a bead on us.
What if Bubber has got
something to hide?
What if he's the wrong guy,
not the hero?
Hell of a story!
No, Deak. That is not a good story.
We backed this guy. He's our boy.
We gave him a vote of confidence.
We gave him a million dollars.
You got it? Four-year scholarship
to a top college or whatever Joey wants.
Pay off the 2,500 to my attorney, pay
her fee in full. My annual consulting--
Plus giving that deposition
to the judge in your behalf. Bernie?
- It is not gonna work.
- Are you kidding?
The judge gets
a testimonial from Bubber.
You think he's not gonna lighten my
sentence for the Angel of Flight 1 04?
That's not what I mean. This scam.
I'm not comfortable deceiving people.
You took my shoe.
Why should you be comfortable?
Uncomfortable is how you should be.
How will you feel if you jump,
breaking the hearts of millions...
...and leave Bernie vomiting on little
kids instead of inspiring them?
Do you think I give a cent to charity?
Help out veterans,
give donations to the homeless?
I'm not a nice guy.
You're the nice guy.
Now do your job.
Be a hero.
Better get rid of your confession.
Are you all right with me
receiving the credit?
I don't take credit.
I'm a cash kind of guy.
What do you say? We got a deal?
You sure we can pull this off?
You're sitting on a ledge about to jump.
I'm about to go to prison.
What exactly have we got to lose?
They're getting to their feet.
Carefully.
You can feel the excitement--
John Bubber is standing
and he's helping his companion--
After what I did, how do you know
you can trust me?
Bottom line, John, I ain't no different
than all those assholes out there.
We all trust you, for chrissake.
That was really dumb,
coming out here on this ledge.
Oh, my God. Bernie.
Oh, my God!
Grab him!
John, grab him! Don't!
No, grab him! Grab him!
Yes! Grab him!
Save yourself. You can't help him.
He's gonna pull you over.
No! Never reach out!
I'm gonna put this around you.
- Put the line on him.
- You can't help him.
If he goes, I go. You got that?
- He'll pull you off!
- Put it on him!
Yes, sir. I got it.
Zooming in tighter yet...
...he captures the stark drama
at great personal risk.
Was I afraid? At moments like that,
you don't think about yourself.
You think about the focus,
about f-stop.
You think about the 1 1 o'clock news...
...everybody counting on you.
Looking good, partner. Hang in there.
You're a goddamn saint, John.
Pardon the vulgarity.
Well, it's true that I saved
Bernard LaPlante's life just now.
But I couldn't have done it
if he hadn't saved my life first.
You see, I had....
I had a terrible moment of weakness.
And I was feeling--
I guess you'd call it overwhelmed...
...by the pressures
of fame and celebrity.
I didn't feel quite adequate.
I wasn't measuring up
to people's expectations of my image...
...and I was gonna take that despair
out on the ledge...
... with the intention--
How did you get in here?
- I snuck in.
- This is private here. No media.
Was it you?
On the plane, who saved my life.
Look, lady.
I don't give no interviews.
I got an attorney.
You got any questions, talk to her.
Mr. LaPlante?
Bernie?
I want to just talk to you like
a human being, not a reporter.
I'm somebody who was gonna die
in a burning plane.
I looked up, and this man
came out of the smoke.
His face was all covered with mud
and soot. And he saved my life.
Off the record, was it you?
''Off the record.''
What's that? Like time out?
Just means it's between us.
Doesn't leave the room.
Lady, do I look dumb enough to run
into a burning plane and save strangers?
I ain't the type.
Right.
We're standing in the lobby
with Evelyn LaPlante...
... who says she is the wife
of the mysterious Bernie LaPlante--
Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty!
--by John Bubber.
Mrs. LaPlante has just told me...
... that Bernard LaPlante
spoke to her earlier today...
...about going away on a long trip...
...and wanting to say goodbye
to his 1 0-year-old son, Joey.
I didn't know Bernie would try to jump
off the building. I didn't understand.
I just thought he was up to his old--
There you go, TV! See that?
You can't believe
one word you hear on TV.
Bernard LaPlante is a decent,
wonderful human being, deep down.
It's bullshit. I swear to God.
Once you know him.
You love your father too?
You leave my boy alone.
My dad's great.
He took me to the zoo.
How did you feel, seeing
your dad up there on that ledge?
I was scared but....
But I....
But what, son?
But I knew John Bubber would save him.
You should at least tell
your son about his father.
Off the record...
...thank you for saving my life.
You're welcome.
- -non-profit organization
designed to help the needy...
...the homeless, the veterans, elderly.
We're even funding a group
for the protection of small animals.
Mr. Bubber?
Mr. Bubber?
Hello, Miss Gayley.
Do you have a question for me?
Everybody thinks of you
as a hero, Mr. Bubber.
How do you see yourself?
I think we're all heros,
if you catch us at the right moment.
We all have something
noble and decent in us.
And we're all
less than heroic at other times.
It's the media that notices...
... one person one moment,
and not another.
I'm just like the next person...
... full of frailty, with some courage...
...some decency mixed in.
You think I'm a hero.
To me, a hero is just a symbol
of what's good in all of us.
You're looking at me...
...and maybe you just notice
what's good in yourself.
What a crock of shit!
Ever heard more bullshit from
somebody who's not even President?
I don't know.
It's not unthinkable.
- What?
- The Presidency.
The public loves him.
You remember what I said?
How I was gonna explain about life?
Well, the thing about life is,
it gets weird.
People always talk to you about truth.
They know what it is...
...like it was toilet paper,
and they got a supply in the closet.
But as you get older,
you learn there ain't no truth.
All there is, is bullshit.
Pardon my vulgarity here.
One layer of bullshit
on top of another.
And what you do in life,
when you get older is...
...you pick the layer you prefer...
...and that's your bullshit,
so to speak.
You got that?
It's complicated.
Maybe when you go to college.
You gotta go to college.
I got it all fixed up.
Your mom and I want you to go.
Listen. What I'm telling you now
is off the record.
It means it don't leave this room.
Whatever, this zoo.
Strict confidence, right?
Remember that night it was raining...
...and I didn't come
to take you to the movies?
The night of the crash, where you seen
on TV where John Bubber saved everyone?
The thing about TV is, don't believe
what you see. Not always.
Not if you're smart.
What really happened is....
And that's what really happened!
But you always said,
'' Keep a low profile.''
And you said,
'' Never stick your neck out.''
Well, how could you go on
a and save 54 people?
Well, I screwed up.
My daughter fell in the lion's cage!
The zookeeper, lady!
Call the zookeeper.
Somebody call the zookeeper,
for chrissake!
Please! Please! My little girl,
she fell in the lion's cage!
Help me! Please!
Oh, for chrissake.
Here...
...watch my shoes.
