- Hand over that gun!
- You thought you held all the cards.
You thought you'd force me
not to file for divorce.
Erica, the gun is mine. I want it.
Not until I've had a good explanation.
Shit! Shit!
- What's going on?
- Drunk-driving in Atlanta, remember?
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.
Get up.
- Whose is this?
- Mine.
- I don't know, 80 in a 55.
- You'll never get away with it.
O ye of little faith!
- Did you fix that transmitter?
- Ready.
What's going on?
Turn me on.
- I'm just a country boy!
- I'll cover that.
Frequency 6, check your local listings.
- A cold reading, $10 ante, who's in?
- I'm with my boss.
I say he can't do it.
Where's your loyalty?
- Oh, child, he looks nasty!
- This is gonna be real good.
Sh! Listen.
Is this beautiful country or what?
How fast was I going?
- 80 in a 55.
- Whoa! Really?
Licence and registration.
Yes, sir.
Let's see what we got here, Lowell.
Let's see.
A playing card. My only royal flush,
signed by Shorty Casewell.
Let's see. We got...
Licence and registration, sir.
Relax, where's the fire?
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Do you have the documents?
Course I do. I'm a law-abiding citizen,
just like yourself.
The difference is there's more to life
than my nine to five.
If you knew that, you'd still have
a wife and daughter to go home to.
Sir, put your hands on the bus,
feet apart.
Whoa! A little cranky, aren't we?
- What's he doing?
- He's gone too far, as usual.
You could've bought me dinner first!
We're gonna take a walk
over to the car, sir. This way.
- He's going to jail.
- He's not.
He stopped writing, didn't he?
Oh, man.
Enough about me, Lowell.
It's not really me you're mad at.
You're mad at yourself, 'cause you lost
the person who loved you.
- You have the right to remain silent.
- "Frequency of names..."
- Anything you say will...
- "By decade, by religion..."
I'm not talking about your ex-wife.
You know who I'm talking about...
...Cathy.
Cathy.
Son of a bitch.
The guy has balls
the size of cantaloupes!
You think I don't know how it is?
Risking your life for minimum wage.
Never enough for those pretty dresses,
that fancy summer camp
all her friends went to.
Then some rich asshole
takes not only your wife,
but your own little girl.
Have you seen her?
Can't say that I have,
but I know people.
And I know she misses the way
you protected her. Like a princess.
The way you smiled at her
the night of the prom.
Good times teaching her the violin.
The what?
Violin...
Clair de lune.
We played that together.
No rich step-daddy can give her that.
She hasn't called in over a year.
You made her choose between you
and her mother. You drove her away.
Maybe I'll call her tonight.
Tonight...
When I got a phone
right there on that bus?
You wouldn't mind?
My brother Lowell,
what are friends for?
Yeah!
Yeah!
I talked to her and
I'll go see her on the weekend.
- Thank you, Brother Lowell.
- I can't thank you enough.
Praise the Lord!
- Did she win?
- And he made a donation. Unbelievable!
I got the Wellesley decal
and the wedding band, but the violin?
Red mark on the jaw from the chin rest.
You know me, I know people!
Yeah, well, I'll make it back
just when you least expect it.
I always expect it.
That's why I always win.
If it wasn't for you, I'd be playing
doctor with some car thief.
- What can I say, man?
- Just say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
- You OK back there?
- Something's blown.
Man!
What's happened?
Truck's blowing smoke, man.
- Next exit, let's get off.
- You got it.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
This is the place.
- You know where we are?
- This is nowhere.
Hey, what's up?
We don't get a replacement part
till Tuesday. Yeah, four days!
- Shit! We'd clean up in Topeka.
- Yeah.
I'm exhausted. We could use a break.
You're gonna get one. We got no choice.
I always have a choice.
Set up, we'll play here.
Here?
Here.
This is where the truckers come.
This looks nice.
I can smell trouble like shit on a griddle.
Take a look at what just walked in.
Dolores, you are such a bone-hound.
Everybody needs a hobby.
Even you.
- Sit down here, baby.
- Like I was saying, that man is nasty!
They believe, yeah!
- He ain't gonna bother you or me.
- I know.
Marva, huh? As in "Marvellous"?
- As in my grandmother.
- Not for a second.
- I'm Jonas.
- Hi.
Something got you down suddenly?
I never knew a problem
Chuck Berry couldn't solve.
It's broken.
Maybe I can fix it.
Life's too short to go without music.
Why don't you try laying on hands?
I wish I could, ma'am,
'cause I know how Jesus loves to rock.
Where's your manners?
He's a preacher. Be polite.
Hm, corn relish! I hate corn relish.
- First female serial killer?
- Aileen Wuornos.
- How many victims?
- Eight.
Special is steak.
No liver, no fish, no spinach.
- Awful lot of noes there, Marva.
- No lip.
I'll take the diet plate, please.
- She wants me.
- Yeah!
You should stick
with your bible-boinkers.
A woman is like a slingshot.
The greater the resistance,
the further you can get with her.
Besides, she's warming up.
What brought him
to the service of Our Lord?
You know, Georgette, to me
there's no greater thrill than preaching.
First moment, you wonder,
"Can I touch them?
"Will they feel what I feel?"
Sometimes they don't feel it at first,
that sense of needing the Lord.
You know how it feels to really need
something, don't you, Georgette?
- Your order?
- Two chilies. Hold the onions.
Sometimes a person doesn't
know what they need.
They wake up itchy,
hungry for whiskey or money or food.
What they really need is love.
Sweet, tender caresses of the Lord.
- Amen! All right, Reverend.
- Amen.
- May I take your order?
- Sure.
I'll have the KKK omelette.
Whites only.
Get out of here!
I'm kidding. I'll have a decaf and toast.
And I give them that love, Georgette,
That... and salvation!
Salvation is the only thing
in this world that matters.
More comforting than a lover.
More valuable than diamonds.
Come on, Preacher! Come on!
See this?
It was a gift from my sainted mother
the year I graduated seminary.
- God bless her.
- Very nice.
I'll get it.
See, Marva?
Nothing has value without salvation.
- He put it in the water!
- Just like it was baptised!
He loves the Lord!
What's the date?
Someone could notice that
in a small town.
It pisses off the law. They think
I've a year's salary on my wrist.
The sheriff is Braverman.
He's clean.
Clean? Ugh!
Mr Nightengale,
arbitrary is not an issue here.
We've got a 27% unemployment rate.
- I need 20 guys for four days.
- Great! 26%!
Look, no new permits
till the plants reopen
or till our farmers get some rain.
Till then, this town can't afford a revival.
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. I understand, Sheriff.
- You're just trying to do your job.
- No. He's trying to restrict trade.
Listen, Braverman.
I got a room full of New York lawyers
dying to take on some badge
interfering with religious freedom!
I got the fee, I'll do the paperwork.
You give me the permit or I dial 2-1-2.
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll do it.
Don't take it personally, boss.
It's just one for the big guy upstairs.
So, is all of this
absolutely necessary, Will?
Local law.
"The Attack of the Puny Brains".
I kissed up to him, I got the permit.
Besides, this one's cute for a change.
Now, concentrate.
Population: 22-something.
Median family income: $21,000...
Cute? He can shut us down.
I don't have to remind you
what our nut is: 3,500 a day.
Every town, another puny brain.
Give a little man power,
he thinks he's powerful.
Yeah, I've seen that happen before.
OK, main industries: Wheat and corn.
Ancillaries have had massive lay-offs.
The banks report 22% farm foreclosure.
If they don't get rain by this weekend,
this year's crops will fail.
So we can use that.
Stop drumming, Jonas! Stop!
What a shit-hole!
This was your choice, so live with it.
Average education: 10th grade.
Richest family: The Rayloves.
12 towns in the same area,
same situation...
I gotta get you a man.
You've been on the road too long.
We're gonna hire us a new angel.
You pick him!
- Finished?
- I'm starting to get excited.
A town this deep in the crapper's
got nowhere to turn but God!
Kansas Radio.
When the going gets tough,
the tough dial S-O-S.
Speaking of things getting tough,
I've got someone here who says
he can help. Jonas Nightengale.
A man who knows
about the value of spirit.
Thank you, Jerry Joe. Thank you.
You know, as I look out your window,
Rustwater reminds me
of my own home town.
Drugstore soda fountain.
Little movie theatre.
The one with the real butter.
And it warms my heart.
So many people working so hard,
deserving so much better.
I know how it feels to see
old man Raylove driving his fancy car,
all the while thinking,
"I want me a car like that."
The problem is
you've got nothing to believe in.
Can't believe in the community
with its trouble,
it seems sometimes even the family.
So what do you believe in?
The biggest power,
the biggest man with the plan...
30 seconds.
So I'm here to remind you
that tonight
at the Rustwater camp-ground
you too, can be saved.
If you're already walking with Jesus,
celebrate your faith with your neighbour.
It's been too long since you've seen him.
If you're still driving that beat-up pickup,
eating macaroni and day-old bread,
come and celebrate the miracle of faith,
the power of healing.
And you too, can wake up saying,
"Thank you, Jesus!"
I been lonely, I been cheated
I been misunderstood
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong
There's a change in my life
Since you came along
Oh, yeah
Now I don't mind working
So hard every day...
Your wife was great to meet.
I'm Jonas Nightengale.
Come down for an old-fashioned
revival with lots of music and singing.
And bring your wife along tonight.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
I been lonely, I been cheated
I been misunderstood
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong
There's a change in my life...
Hey, what's your name?
You go to high school here?
No? Going to college?
Now, a man, a man gets crazy
When he finds he's done wrong
And a heart, a heart gets weary
When it doesn't belong
And the road, the road gets rocky, Lord
You've got to keep on
Let the new light come
Shining on through
I been lonely, I been cheated...
Tonight, tomorrow night and the next...
Hey, Jonas Nightengale.
How are you?
Keep your eye on the squirt gun.
One, two, three!
Gone.
Come to the tent meeting.
Miracles and wonders.
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong
There's a change in my life
Since you came along
I been lonely, I been cheated
I been misunderstood
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong
There's a change in my life
Since you came along...
I sink this one,
you guys come to the meeting?
- Yeah, all right.
- OK.
Afternoon, sir.
Sheriff sent me to check for violations.
I bet he did.
Go ahead, we're clean. Go on.
Knock yourself out.
Great. It's a frigging hootenanny!
You've been very busy, Will.
Just doing my job.
Yeah, I can see that.
It's been a long day.
Can I buy you a beer?
Tell me, do most of the cops
fall for your act?
Yeah.
I'll bet they do.
Well, ma'am, sorry about the drink,
but I'm on duty.
No, no. My mom is "ma'am".
You can call me Jane.
All right.
Goodbye, Jane.
Goodbye, Will.
Just kidding.
You have any towels?
Wow, nice room!
What's the matter? You seem down.
I'm just bummed about Topeka.
I wanted to see that breeder.
- You can't keep a Great Dane on a bus.
- Why not?
Lt'd be great company.
Why don't you give this to me?
It looks better on me.
You'll get it when I die unless you kill me.
And it's in my will that way.
- My offer still holds for a new angel.
- I can just see it.
"Wanted: Single tenor with interest
in gourmet cooking and mail fraud."
- What's new with Miss Congeniality?
- Nothing.
And I'm using all my "A" material.
How could she not go for it?
So you strike out for once.
What do you care?
It's got me curious.
She's got fuming down to an art.
It's a matter of principle, like a quest.
Sort of a Holy Grail of road pussy?
Eloquent as always.
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!
Bibles! Tambourines!
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!
Get your bibles here!
How are you doing this evening?
Come right in. Come right in.
Tambourines! Praise the Lord!
Bibles! T-shirts! Bumper stickers!
- Come on up!
- Come right in!
Bumper stickers!
Have you ever seen anything
like that in your life?
- Bless you.
- Bless you. Come right on in.
Come right on in.
Hi, how are you?
- Hey, how's it going?
- OK.
Let's see what we've got.
Where are you?
Oh, there you are. Nice suit!
Guys!
Excuse me. Are you from Rustwater?
- No, I drove 30 miles to be here.
- 30 miles. That far?
- What is your name?
- Emma Schlarp.
I have a great seat
right in front of the preacher for you.
- Would you like to have it?
- Oh, yes.
Sit right here,
and I'll roll you down there.
That's very nice of you.
It's a much better view
and this chair's a lot softer.
Thank you.
It's nothing but trouble with that old man.
He's got 80 yards of electrified fence
spitting distance to the house.
You know our kids play over there,
and somebody's gonna get hurt.
...loving Jesus gives you
a warm feeling in your stomach...
Guy in cowboy hat
says he loves Jesus.
Really? I thought
they were just good friends.
Make sure to hit him up personally.
Absolutely.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
Cut it out, Matt!
- You here alone?
- I'm with my mom.
If she catches me talking with you...
I gotta go, OK?
Can I see you after the show?
- OK. Nice to see you.
- You, too.
Girl in glitter jeans is pregnant.
Her mother's been beating her.
That's nice.
Where is she sitting?
Town's small, Jonas.
Don't mention she's knocked up.
I'll be good.
Did you study my summary?
Yeah. And the Grange ladies told me
who's been sleeping around.
Tiny, you got the smoke ready?
What's Roger doing?
Tell him five shills is enough.
Come on, the angels will see him.
What's the deal
with the cherry hat again?
Electric fence.
Visualise the fence with cherries on it.
- What do you like? This or this?
- Ready to check your receiver?
I'm having an accessory crisis.
Testing sibilance, one, two.
Can you hear me?
That's fine.
Boy, are you a tough room!
The dark grey, definitely.
You look gorgeous.
Always look better than they do, Janey.
And now, let's go give
some empty lives a little meaning!
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be!
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free
Are you ready? Are you ready?
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free
Are you ready for a miracle?
Be strong in the Lord
and in the power of his might!
Be strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!
Put on the whole armour of God
that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the Devil!
Come on, Hoov. Goose 'em.
I got a cold audience out there.
Yes, I'm ready! Yeah!
I hear Satan knocking,
but he can't come in! Yes, sir!
Come on, people!
Turn it loose,
let him fix it and let him in!
Take it down, angels.
I gotta talk to these people.
I gotta talk to these people a second.
I wanna tell you a story...
- This'll move you.
...about a man from New York.
A man named Thomas.
Now, Thomas lived on Fifth Avenue.
Views of Central Park
even from the bathroom!
Beautiful wife. Two sweet kids.
But his life was a mess.
You know why?
Because of the fear.
Afraid his business would fail.
Afraid his children would come to harm.
Afraid of balding
and his wife leaving him.
Afraid of death.
But death's a breeze.
Ever heard of anyone
coming back to complain? No!
- It's life that'll kill you...
- Matt, give your people a wake-up call.
...and Thomas was a prisoner of fear.
- Amen, Preacher!
- Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!
...he got a $2,000 hairpiece
and a world-class doctor.
- But was Tom happy?
- No!
No! N-O.
Because when Thomas finally
came to me, he still had the fear.
The fear is bigger than doctors!
The fear is bigger than money!
- Absolutely!
- Amen!
There's only thing bigger
than the fear, my friends.
And that one thing... is the faith.
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah! Yeah!
Faith that the universe needs him!
Faith that his woman
loves his soul not his hair!
Faith that his children will be protected
not by a man with a.357 Magnum,
but by The Man with the super-charged
grenade launcher of love!
And that one man is one man
and one man only.
That man is Jesus Christ!
Yeah!
If you wanna feel happy,
if you wanna feel love,
all you gotta do...
If you wanna feel safe,
if you wanna feel strong,
if you wanna walk tall,
all you gotta do,
all you gotta do,
all you gotta do is get saved!
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!
- Say "Hallelujah."
- Hallelujah!
- Looking good, Jo Jo.
- Holy juice pumps through my veins!
I feel a healing coming on.
But I need to know
you're on the side of the Lord.
I need a sign of your faith.
I'm not asking you to pay
for this beautiful music, no!
I'm not asking you to pay
for the word of God.
What I do need is
some token that you believe.
- How about that ruby ring?
- You belong to the most exclusive club!
A club that only God's
faithful and generous can join.
- Only then...
- Give me that ring!
No one can keep you
out of the kingdom of heaven!
- Tell her I'm gonna kill her!
- You're meat, baby.
OK, I'll be good!
They are going to pass among you.
- The more you give, the more you live!
- Praise the Lord, brother!
The Lord spoke to me tonight.
He's searching for some special people.
They'll receive great rewards
in material goods.
He wants these special people
to be saved here on stage with me!
It's sad out there, that's all I have to say.
It's burgers tonight.
Oh, people,
the Lord is speaking to me right now.
- It better be good.
- Relax. Cherry hat. Section 4, row F.
You, sir, in the brown jacket.
I feel your burden.
Who? Who, me?
Yes, sir. Tell me
if I'm hearing the Lord right.
- You've a problem with your neighbour?
- I sure have!
- That fence is going to harm your kids?
- Yes, sir!
Amazing!
...make him your friend,
serve him your best fried chicken!
- 'Cause yours is the best in the county.
- It is!
I'd love some of that.
Now thank the Lord for his saving!
Section 5, row A is the glitter jeans.
Remember glitter jeans?
Sister!
You're suffering deeply.
You're worried about your little girl.
- Yes, Reverend.
- Stand up.
The Lord says a strike unto any
of his children is a strike unto him.
Lord, I hear you. Please forgive me.
- Jesus forgives you. Say "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!
Fishing cap, section 4, row F.
You, sir. Come up on stage
and be cured of your gambling!
That's incredible!
Section 1, pink mu-mu. She lost her job.
You, in the pink dress.
Receive the Lord
and you will find another job!
First row. White shirt. Back problem.
You, sir. Believe in the Lord
and cure your backache!
Same section, yellow shirt.
Hearing problem.
You, sir, come up on stage!
Hearing problem!
Section 2, the blue-haired lady.
She's got arthritis.
You, too, ma'am. Come up on stage!
- We're gonna help some people.
- Ah, we are!
- He's got trouble with his neighbours.
- Let him fix it! Let him in!
Hallelujah!
I'm feeling something tonight!
- He's got a sore neck.
- Receive the anointing in Jesus' name!
- Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
- She needs a job.
You need a job?
Now you're working for Jesus!
- A gambling man.
- Get the strength in your life!
Holy name of Jesus!
- He can't hear a thing.
- Hear the word, hear the word!
In Jesus' holy name!
- Welcome to the kingdom of heaven.
- Arthritis.
Arthritis? Take the hand
of God's right-hand man.
Believe in the power of the Lord. Believe.
Raise your hands. Raise them up!
Wave your hands like this!
Thank you, Jesus!
Someone here's just been
cured of their asthma.
Hello, friend!
She's got bad bones, Reverend.
Hold it, hold it!
Take it down just a second.
Take it down.
We got someone special here.
- What's your name?
- Emma Schlarp.
- How long you had bone trouble?
- Years.
Well, God's gonna make
a miracle for you tonight.
O Lord, I'm just a man like any other,
but send a miracle through my hands
to help my sister Emma.
Come on, Emma.
Show me the power of the Lord.
Praise God. Praise God.
Praise God!
Thank you, Jesus. Come on, walk to me.
Go on, Emma!
Yes! Yes!
It's a miracle! Hallelujah!
It's a miracle! Dance with me!
Oh, say, "Thank you, Jesus."
Thank you, Jesus!
And I'm walking...
Highway up to heaven
No one can walk up there
But the pure in heart
It's a highway up to heaven
And I'm walking...
I'm so glad it's a highway up to heaven
You just can't walk up there
You got to be pure in heart
It's a highway up to heaven...
Thank you. Thank Jesus!
In the name of Jesus!
- How did we do?
- About four grand.
Hey, Tony, I'm dressing!
Sorry, pal.
What's he doing here?
Well, well.
If it isn't my new best friend.
We've had the fire department,
the sanitation department.
What now? The Girl Scouts?
Nightengale, we both know
there's nothing I can do legally.
I'm here man to man.
Folks have lost their jobs, their land.
They can't feed their families.
So they sure can't afford
a con man like you.
Do a good thing. Pack it up.
That's some plain talk, Will.
So I'll give you a little in return.
- Good night, folks.
- Night, sir.
Let's assume I was
what you said I was.
In New York, they've got
Broadway shows costing $65 a pop
just to walk in the door.
Maybe you like the show.
Maybe you don't, and you kick yourself.
I give my people a good show,
plenty of music,
worthwhile sentiments.
Most of them go home
with a little hope in their lives.
Now, usually, I only play towns
that can afford me.
But what about towns like this
that really need me?
You don't care what these people need.
You're looking to cash in.
Oh, pissing contest! Can I watch?
- I won't just go away.
- Now, that sounds good!
'Cause you owe me that drink, Will.
Jonas, in the bus.
Will, what's that guy from
the sanitation department's name?
- Phil.
- Phil? I called him Frank. Anyway...
Come on, Janey! Wake up, baby!
God! It's eight o'clock!
I know what time it is.
I've been driving all night.
Wait till you see this. Close your eyes.
- They were closed.
- Come on, close them.
Pucker up.
Kiss. Big kiss.
Wow!
Hi! Where did you get him?
I found a breeder in Clydedale.
I convinced him to open late.
Ah, so let's hear it for insomnia.
I was worried about
your lack of companionship.
- What's his name?
- He's smart and hung like a moose.
- So I thought...
- Jack from Neptune!
- Come on!
- I know, Jonas Junior.
- Jonas! He's a good boy, too!
- He's great.
So here we'll make "such" as "drought",
"really" is "rain".
- And we'll make "won't" "tornadoes".
- OK, try me.
"Brother Jonas, I am wondering,
what question burns inside this woman."
If there'll be a twister
at her son's home in Wilmington.
- No, "wondering" is "Wichita".
- Wichita!
- I don't wanna do this audience tonight.
- Why? You're good.
- That's not the point.
- Relax. Pathos isn't contagious.
Besides, the badge saw the set-up
last night. We can't take the chance.
- What did you two do after dinner?
- Nothing. I'm just greasing the wheels.
- Till one in the morning? A lot of grease.
- Your spies are slipping.
I was out till two.
You know how to play this, Jane.
Just watch your step!
Mr Nightengale, I'm so glad I caught you.
I was at your meeting last night,
and I heard what you said
to that family who lost their farm.
My husband lost his job, and
it's been hard putting food on the table.
Sorry to hear that. Come down tonight
and maybe I can help.
Oh, heavens, it's not me.
The best way to forget your troubles
is to help someone else with theirs.
This is for that unfortunate family.
Will you see that they get it?
I certainly will.
That's mighty Christian of you.
Bless you.
You try it and you're toast!
You're gonna get it now!
Hey, Rev!
Looking for some souls to save?
You know me, I hate to see
even one get away. Souls, that is.
I brought you this. It's the best in town.
- Hey, kid. How about a game?
- Da.
- I thought you had homework.
- I'll do it later.
Little Russkie, huh?
I ever tell you I was
East Coast chess champion 1971?
My sister's a total slave-driver.
- Go ahead and make your move.
- What do you think I just did?
That was a neat trick you did yesterday.
- The hand's quicker than the eye.
- So they tell me.
Nice move, kid.
Hey, Marva, could I have a thé glacé?
It's French for iced tea.
- Where's your church?
- On every street corner in every town.
- You don't have a church.
- I have a ministry, which is better.
My grandmother
used to take me with her.
So you believe in miracles, right?
Concentrate on your game, Boyd.
I'd like to hear what your sister
has to say on the subject.
I believe in life, what it does to you
and what you do back.
Never underestimate the power of belief.
With it, I've seen a mute sing "Hallelujah"
and a cripple dance.
When you've got it, you've got the power
of every ocean in your hand.
Without it, you've got nothing.
Everyone is just another sinner,
and everywhere is just another hell.
I'll be outside.
- My sister thinks you're a fake.
- Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.
If I get the job done,
what difference does it make?
You're gonna need a miracle now,
because check and mate-ski!
This town is full of single women.
Leave me alone.
It must be your money.
I've seen many people lie to themselves,
but they don't fool anyone.
Lying, huh?
Your personal area of expertise?
That's not true.
My talent is telling people the truth.
Like that picture on the wall in there.
Best day of your life.
- One of.
- Sure it was.
You were young, you were free.
You still had that spark in your eye.
Now you hide out in that diner,
never letting anyone get next to you.
The last time you had a man
Nixon was in office.
How I live my life is none
of your business. What do you want?
I want to know how come you gave up.
A drunk truck driver did that.
Four hours stuck in a crash
watching our mom and dad die.
Doctors did all they could.
Took tests, stuck him with needles.
All for nothing.
So he had me take him to a preacher.
And the preacher got him up on stage.
When it was all over,
he was still on his crutches.
Know what he said to my little brother?
He said that it was his fault,
'cause his faith wasn't strong enough.
Let me tell you something.
All that boy has is faith.
The last thing he needs is
another phoney messing him up.
And the last thing I need is another man
using him to get me into bed.
Hey, Rev, how about a rematch?
Sorry, kid, I gotta go.
Can't stand the heat, huh?
Got it in one, kid.
If I pick it too soon, it won't sweeten.
If I leave it on the stock too long,
it rots on the way to market.
Too much rain turns it mouldy,
too little and it's hog-feed.
Timing's everything.
Same as in my business.
You gotta pick 'em while they're ripe.
Will, I know you think I'm crooked,
so why'd you ask me here?
Well, you know those programmes
where they take delinquents
out to the woods and rehabilitate them?
- This isn't the woods.
- Smart girl.
I knew you were worth saving.
You've too much going for you
to be somebody's front man.
OK, guys, let's go!
Pick it up!
- Hey, Rev.
- Hey, kid.
Watch.
My dad used to lift weights.
He was state champion.
- Great, comrade. You gonna compete?
- Yeah, all events done sitting down!
It's something I gotta do.
You have anything like that?
Something I gotta do?
No, I stick with what I wanna do.
It's a tough policy, but it works for me.
Do you always jog in a cowboy hat?
I used to jog in my boots.
What did the doctors tell you?
Doctors have nothing to do with my leg.
I'll walk if it's God's will.
Listen, God doesn't have
a trucker's licence.
You think you were chosen to suffer?
If you've done everything you can,
doctors, therapy, that's great.
But if you haven't, get off your ass,
'cause God won't do it for you.
Look, kid,
everybody's a loser one of these days.
The trick is not acting like a loser.
I believe things happen for a reason.
Fine. You wanna believe that?
That's great.
I'm gonna run.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I'm worried about that two-man code.
Maybe. But that's not why you're late.
These are for me?
Can I read it?
Gidget goes dustbowl.
Fine, have your little secret.
Will said he's got a surprise for you.
Something about
giving you enough rope.
Tell him to go kick some shit!
There's not enough rope in Kansas
to hang me.
Besides, wait till you see the pitch.
Got a little surprise
