KNOCK ON WOOD
You arrived okay?
How is everything?
Perfect. I have a room on the ocean.
It's fantastic.
No, I'm fine.
I want to go for a walk before lunch.
No, I'll be careful.
Nothing will happen to me.
No, don't worry, I tell you.
All right. Yes, Dad.
A man with a parachute is going by.
It's magnif...
Hello, Dad?
Yes, we were cut off.
I tell you there's no reason to worry.
What could possibly happen to me?
Are you hurt?
What happened to me?
Come on. I'll take care of you.
Well, this certainly isn't your day.
Emergency? The main entrance.
Stop!
Mr. Bens.
May I speak to you a moment?
I don't have time.
See my secretary.
It's about your daughter, sir.
Come with me.
I'm listening.
My idea is going to seem
absurd to you, sir.
She disappeared 42 days ago.
Neither the police
nor my private agent have found her.
Mr. Meyer, I've even consulted
a psychic with a pendulum.
No ideas seem absurd anymore.
You're going to say I'm crazy, sir.
Excuse me.
Wait a second.
Lend me that for a moment.
You have a man in accounting
named Francois Perrin.
Ask him to join us in the board room.
Let's try a little experiment.
I've worked here for 10 years, sir.
I've never known your daughter
to have anything but bad luck.
She's amazingly accident-prone.
She's the unluckiest girl I know.
Bad luck is fascinating, sir.
Fascinating.
Mr. Perrin is here, sir.
Send him in.
You'll ask him to sit down.
- What?
- Just ask him to sit down.
Good morning, sir.
Please sit down.
Sit down.
- Do I have to sit down?
- Yes.
Where?
Wherever you like.
I'm sorry.
Thank you. You may go now.
Your daughter probably
would have done the same thing.
Mr. Campana is here, sir.
Come in, Mr. Campana.
Thanks for coming at once.
This is Mr. Meyer,
the company psychologist.
Mr. Meyer has an idea
he'd like to submit to you.
Have a seat.
Before you went
to Mexico to investigate...
I told you about
my daughter's bad luck.
Mr. Meyer has evolved
from that a theory...
which at first may seem absurd, but...
Go ahead, Meyer.
I say the only way to find her...
is to give the case to a man
as unlucky as she is.
A man like you can't do it.
You're normal.
But an unlucky guy will slip
on the same banana peels as she does.
He'll be able find her.
May I speak to you alone?
What is this crap?
Please step out.
I've been at this for 10 years,
and clowns like him never succeed.
- Listen...
- I spent 42 days there.
I did my very best.
Don't believe guys like him.
All they do is sell hope.
You'll go back there with Mr. Perrin
and start from scratch.
- Who?
- Mr. Perrin.
He works in accounting.
Meyer has studied him.
He's the man we need.
I'm sorry. Count me out.
Don't walk out on me, I beg you.
Don't let me down.
It's my last hope.
There he is.
He was hired two years ago.
I tested him then,
and I've observed him since.
He's phenomenal.
He looks normal enough.
He was born prematurely,
at seven months.
Guess what happened
to his incubator.
It broke down.
I don't believe in bad luck. Bullshit.
You've heard of
Eugene Delacroix, the painter.
At three, he was nearly
strangled by a curtain cord.
Then his mosquito net caught fire.
He was badly burned.
While he was recovering...
he was dropped into some water.
Miraculously, he was saved, but...
then he choked on some grapes.
That is all absolutely true.
Delacroix is an example
of incredible bad luck.
Mr. Perrin is here, sir.
Now you play along.
You know what I think of this.
Send him in.
Come in, Mr. Perrin.
You know Mr. Meyer.
And this is Mr. Campana.
Sit down, Mr. Perrin.
You're wondering why I've sent for you.
Yes, sir.
You know what happened to my daughter.
Yes, sir. It's terrible.
You can help me.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Mr. Meyer says you have keen insight...
and unusual deductive powers.
I'm asking you to go to Mexico
to look for my daughter.
You are my last hope.
To Mexico?
Mr. Campana will go with you.
He's a detective.
He'll be your assistant.
Well, do you accept?
Glad to be working with you.
You've been unlucky so far,
but with me, that will change.
I'll give it all I've got.
We'll make a good team.
I'll get a cart.
- Hey, that's my cart.
- Sorry?
I just got it for my bags.
Don't get sore.
Your name's not on it.
I open my trunk
and he swipes my cart.
If you wanted to keep it,
why did you leave it here?
- I didn't. I was opening my trunk.
- Forget it. Come on.
No, this has become uncivil.
Shit. I go miles to find a cart
and this nerd swipes it.
We don't need a cart for two bags.
Come on.
He called me a nerd.
This is between him and me.
Don't interfere.
You called me a nerd?
I practice judo, aikido and karate.
What we learn first is self-control.
If insulted, don't slug.
Just stare and leave.
Then beat it.
You're lucky.
Take your cart and leave.
You're lucky.
Asshole.
You're lucky.
Queer.
Total control.
Let's go.
I'm sorry I had to show force.
I hate disrespect.
That's the first time...
the electronic doors
have failed to work.
You okay?
I checked our bags in.
Hurry up or we'll miss the plane.
I feel dizzy.
- Doors that fail to...
- We'll miss the plane.
That's the first time.
Hurry up!
- Damn!
- What?
I left my case in the infirmary.
Forget it!
Too late. We missed it.
Wait here.
It's all arranged.
DELAYED
There you are.
I'll get my case.
We have time now.
You didn't call in
a bomb threat, did you?
Well, we'll make the flight.
He did it, the dirty bastard.
It can't be helped. I told Mr. Bens
we'd leave today, and we will.
When I get going,
it's hard to stop me.
- Mr. Perrin?
- Come with us.
Is this your bag?
Sorry, it was an accident.
- What?
- Some ass called in a bomb threat.
A false alarm. But your bag
suffered during the inspection.
Itemize its contents
and you'll be reimbursed.
I have to check it in.
You can take it on
as hand luggage now.
You're too late.
We'll leave tomorrow.
- Are there any flights to Acapulco?
- Yes, at 2:00 p.m.
At Acapulco we'll get a plane
to Puerto Vallarta.
That way we won't lose a day.
Do you like flying?
I love it.
But last time we had a problem.
We almost crashed.
It was at Orly. The wing flaps
got stuck during takeoff.
We went off the runway
and plunged into a field.
Happens often, it seems.
- We're about to take off, I hope.
- Cut it out.
It's taking a long time.
- Are we up yet?
- Damn it!
Don't shout. You scared me.
Why won't this crate take off?
You noticed too.
There we go.
You don't like flying, do you?
Puerto Vallarta, 4:30 p.m.
All right.
We've got an hour to wait.
For the head accountant...
"Greetings from Acapulco!"
He'll die of envy.
Who am I forgetting?
That door jamming at Orly...
- Wasn't that odd?
- Yes.
Mademoiselle Martin!
I like her.
She helped me out
when I got electrocuted.
Electrocuted?
At the office, plugging in
the orange juice machine.
I got juice, all right.
Orange juice, electric juice.
Get it?
I'll go wash my hands.
The lady attendant didn't want my franc.
She wanted pesos.
She said, "Pesos."
I said, "I have no pesos."
Finally...
- May I have the salt?
- Sure.
At last she took my franc,
but what an ordeal.
- Why are you staring at me?
- No reason.
Too salty.
- What is your plan?
- What?
We'll be arriving soon.
You're in charge of the case.
Do you have a plan?
The traditional method.
And what method is that?
Get tips from the underworld.
- Underworld?
- From the racketeers.
Sorry.
I scoured this damn country
for 42 days in vain!
But I'm here now.
Don't let me discourage you...
but she vanished 42 days ago...
without the slightest trace.
So I don't see...
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
Not bad,
the girls in this country.
Will you stop clowning around?
Clowning around?
I've got a bloody nose!
Then go to the infirmary.
Come in.
It's about time.
The nurse was very cute.
I was talking to her.
I told her what happened at Orly,
and the same thing just happened here...
a girl bumped into the door.
A French girl. Isn't that odd?
What's wrong?
Wait here.
It does look like her.
She's blond,
but it does look like her.
- And the guy who was with her?
- His name is Arbal.
He's a hoodlum.
How can we find him?
We've tried for five years.
- Is that all you know?
- You might ask Inspector Custao.
He's at police headquarters.
We can phone him from here.
Let me talk to Inspector Custao.
- We missed the plane.
- We're staying here.
What do you mean?
Our bags have left.
- That may be the Bens girl.
- What type of car do you want, sir?
Same age and face, but black hair...
and traveling
with a hoodlum named Arbal.
I'm going to see the inspector
in charge of the case at 6:00 p.m.
Good thing I ran into the door.
If I hadn't bumped into...
Stop bugging me with that shit!
- What's gotten into you?
- It's a coincidence.
And we're not even sure it's her.
So save your breath
and let me do my job.
What's the matter?
You act like the boss
and I don't like it.
Mr. Bens said I was in charge.
You're my assistant.
Don't force me to call him.
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- What?
Nothing.
You better watch it.
Okay. Get moving.
All I have is a lovely suite
on the sea...
and a tiny room in the back.
That's for him.
The suite for me.
See you at the bar
in an hour for a briefing.
How long will you stay, sir?
Two or three days, no more.
Do you have water?
- In your room.
- Yeah.
I don't. I can't take a shower.
I told the desk.
Let's see now.
- When are we seeing that inspector?
- At 6:00 p.m.
What do you suggest now?
It's highly unlikely
that the girl was Marie Bens...
but we'll check it out anyway.
That airport cop said
she dropped her handbag.
It contained a fake passport
with a phony name.
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, I am.
I was saying
she had a fake passport.
That's no proof at all
that she was Marie Bens.
Unless she was kidnapped,
drugged, given a wig...
Cut it out.
I think I've made a hit.
- Fifty dollars.
- Sorry?
She's a 50-dollar whore.
You're way off track.
I can spot a pro when I see one.
And I know when I turn a woman on.
Just go up to her and say "fifty"...
and you'll be in bed in three minutes.
I don't believe it.
I'll give you the 50
if it doesn't work.
- Now about Marie Bens...
- I did exactly as you said.
Okay, I was wrong. Let's forget it.
I got slapped in public.
- You did it on purpose.
- Not at all!
Just to ridicule me.
Because you're a bastard.
She's a 50-buck whore!
She'll go with any man, but not you.
- And why not me?
- Why do you stumble?
Why is your bag damaged?
Why don't you have water?
Are you the one
who called my girl a whore?
No, he did.
No one called anyone a whore.
It's a misunderstanding.
- He said she was worth $30.
- Fifty!
Well done.
Okay, now.
Let's not lose our tempers.
Excuse me.
I'm Francois Perrin.
Forgive me.
It was all my friend's fault.
I'd never do something like that.
Do you forgive me?
May I say you're lovely?
Sorry, I don't have a card.
My name is Francois Perrin.
Suite number three.
Call me. We'll have a drink.
We have a lot to talk about,
you and I.
See you very soon. Call me.
Bye now.
I did it. It's all arranged.
We have to go see the inspector now
or we'll be late.
Seven years' bad luck.
Oh, shit.
This was in her handbag.
Maybe yes, maybe no.
She looks drugged.
What's the matter?
I'm okay.
Excuse me. I need some fresh air.
He's emotional.
No, he bumped his head twice today.
This must not be his day.
It's never his day.
- Did he fall?
- Probably.
I don't think it's her.
Arbal isn't the type
to try to kidnap anyone.
Besides, no one
has asked for a ransom.
Has he been seen since?
He must have friends in town.
He once lived with a girl, Sonia.
She works at the Sunny Club,
a pick-up bar on the docks.
Are you okay?
So-so.
I'll drop you off at the hotel.
Yeah, my head hurts.
- Where are you going?
- To the Sunny Club.
I'm going to get some sleep.
- What is that club?
- It's a pick-up bar.
It would be wrong to sleep now.
I'd wake up too early tomorrow.
I'd better stay up.
I'm going with you.
Does Sonia work here?
Not anymore.
She quit three weeks ago.
No forwarding address.
Let's go.
- I'd like a drink.
- At the hotel. Come on.
Let's ask one of her friends.
Why the rush?
We've got work tomorrow.
Then go to bed.
I'm staying on deck.
- And what are you gonna do "on deck"?
- Question a witness!
You mean pay for a whore
at Mr. Bens' expense. Admit it.
- Who said anything about paying?
- Make up your mind.
May I buy you a drink?
What would you like?
Do you speak Spanish?
It won't be easy to question her.
You're right. I'll pick another one.
I'll manage.
I'll question her in English.
Is that English?
- What?
- Forget it.
Fifty dollars.
Stop it. Stop it.
Come on, Campana, relax.
I give you the evening off.
Question one of them.
Forget that twat! Let's split!
It's obvious
this girl knows something.
It's obvious she knows
she's hooked a sucker.
Dancing runs in my blood.
Give me your bread.
- Give me your roll.
- Why?
Because she'll swipe it,
you dumbbell.
What did you call me?
What did you just call me?
- A nerd?
- No, what did you call me?
A moron?
- You did it on purpose!
- No, I didn't notice.
Well, I did.
And I'll never forget.
I'm leaving.
I may even quit.
I'm fed up with your shit.
I don't need an assistant like you.
I'm going home. I'm tired.
Here. Good-bye.
It's very kind of you.
Doesn't matter.
Life is incredible.
One day I'm alone in gray Paris...
adding figures.
The next day I'm in sunny Mexico
with a blond...
living an adventure.
I'm very lucky.
Reception desk?
Mr. Perrin isn't back yet?
Thanks.
What's that nerd up to?
Is this the way to the hotel?
This is not the right way.
Where are we going?
What are you up to?
If I'm not back in an hour,
go on home.
Bye.
If he comes back,
tell him I'm looking for him.
Call a doctor!
Was it that blond?
My money!
All my money!
- See you later.
- Wait.
I'm going with you.
Porter, put this in my car.
Where is she?
With Fernando.
He runs a gambling joint.
- May we come in?
- It's private.
- How do we join the club?
- Let me go.
We can't hear you. Open up.
- Where's Fernando?
- What do you want with him?
We want our deposit back.
$2,000.
That was your tip. Thank you.
Good-bye, ladies and gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
We should be hunting
for Arbal and we goof off.
Don Juan gets ripped off by a whore.
Stop sniveling.
I admit I did wrong.
I ask you to forgive me.
Okay, forget it.
- What did you do?
- It was a Kleenex.
No, my handkerchief!
I'm sorry.
I'm all mixed up.
We'll find that Arbal.
What does he look like?
Medium build, dark hair.
- Without a photo...
- But I have one, of course.
I've been at this for 10 years.
Okay, you have no memory for faces.
It's no tragedy.
I often forget faces too.
A good cop can have poor vision.
Vision decreases with age.
Cut it out.
Let me go!
But I just donated.
You know her?
I'm not a cop.
I just want to find Marie Bens.
Help me and you'll get $1,000.
Get out!
You've got five seconds.
One...
two...
three...
four...
I knew she'd bring nothing but trouble.
- That's her!
- Think so?
- Trouble, that's her!
- Nothing but trouble!
You poor guy.
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. Tell me about it.
I didn't want to hurt her.
I didn't know who she was.
When I found out, I got rid of her.
It was too big for me.
I gave her to Fernando.
The gambler?
- And now?
- I have no idea what became of her.
And I don't want to know.
Let's go.
I want to talk to Fernando.
Back to the club.
That will make three times!
Don't take me there.
If they guess I talked,
I'm a dead man.
- Give me my money.
- It's at the hotel. Let's go.
- What now?
- I don't know.
We're stuck.
I don't believe it.
- What a nerd!
- Who?
You!
Why did you stop in this shit?
Don't shout!
You said stop and I did.
And you stop in this shit.
Maybe I did, but at least
my vision isn't shitty.
- What?
- If I've got a guy's picture...
I don't have to backtrack
so I can recognize him.
What a laugh.
The big pro, blind as a bat.
He bawls me out...
but if he bumps into his quarry,
he says sorry and leaves.
Look out!
Perrin. Are you hurt?
No, I'm okay.
Is he hurt?
Nothing but trouble. I knew it.
Is he dead?
Is that gas I smell?
He's dead and there's
a hole in the gas tank.
Marie Bens could be
in a Venezuelan whorehouse by now.
Are there many whorehouses there?
We'll try them all.
Day and night, without sleeping,
we'll try them all.
We'll ask Bens for more cash.
What are you doing?
It's a shortcut.
You won't get mad if I say something?
It's thanks to me we found Arbal.
If I hadn't bought that blond a drink...
they wouldn't have robbed me and we...
I don't believe in magic.
I believe in logic.
Do you know what logic is?
I'm a rational, logical man.
I don't rely on coincidence
to solve a case.
What is it now?
- I don't know. I'm sinking.
- Why?
I said I don't know.
Stop clowning around
when I'm talking to you.
I'm not clowning around.
I'm really sinking.
Why aren't I sinking?
You're on good sand
and I'm on quicksand.
You're the one
who wanted to take a shortcut.
And you don't even react?
If I do, I'll sink more.
Everyone knows that.
They didn't show
any quicksand on the map.
Then it's time they did!
Hold on.
Shit. I lost a shoe.
Don't you ever rest?
Come on, hurry.
Open up.
We're innocent.
We're French!
Open up!
How long will we stay here?
I told them to call Inspector Custao.
Open up, for God's sake!
- Stop. It's no use.
- No, it's no use.
I've been here for two years.
Here they come.
They'll pick one of us at random
and beat him to a pulp.
That's their idea of fun.
What did he say?
They'll beat one of us up.
Really?
Why are you staring at me like that?
You!
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Come with us.
Thanks, pal.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You're in pain. Come here.
Rest for a while.
Are you hurt?
No, don't touch me.
Don't get near me.
You're just not lucky.
There's no such thing as luck.
Did you yell?
Come with me.
Who?
Campana and Perrin?
I'll be right there.
I'm terribly sorry.
It's a silly misunderstanding.
They found Arbal
and thought you'd killed him.
I'll take you to the hotel.
We apologize.
It was Marie.
We may still find her.
Where is she?
Let me handle it.
Get some rest.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
This is Custao.
Yes, Fernando talked.
And I've got bad news for you.
She's dead?
It's as if she was.
To hide her, they put her on a plane.
But it never arrived.
It must have crashed in the jungle.
No wonder there was no ransom.
That's all I know.
I'm sorry.
I'll let you tell her father.
Mr. Bens.
Until we have proof she's dead,
I won't believe it.
She's had too much bad luck
for us to give up hope.
She has a fantastic guardian angel.
He's had so much work with her
that he's an expert.
We've got to trust him.
I've lost hope now.
You can't find a small plane
in a rain forest.
It's hopeless.
I'm not so sure.
Sorry, I tripped over your shoe.
Never mind. It was my fault.
Bring me another.
Shall I send for the maid?
No, it doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
We're going home.
- What?
- She was in a plane crash.
How soon can you be ready?
Hello, Mr. Bens.
I'll let you talk to him.
Mr. Meyer has an idea.
I'll let him explain it.
You'll rent a plane.
Yes, rent a plane, put Perrin in it...
and circle over the jungle.
What?
What are you up to this time?
I won't argue now.
I'll call you back. Good-bye.
Of all the stupid, asinine shit.
What's wrong?
They won't admit defeat.
What do they say?
For you to fly circles over the jungle.
That's an odd plan.
- Come in.
- Ready?
- You got water?
- Yes, they fixed it. Why?
Let's go.
I'm going to enjoy this plane ride.
Your shoestring.
Your shoestring.
I broke it.
It's no tragedy.
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?
Never mind.
You got parachutes?
No. Have you ever seen
a parachute in a plane like this?
Where can we get one?
You sure do trust me.
I don't mean you.
I mean we might have engine trouble.
He sure is optimistic.
He'll bring us bad luck.
That beats all.
You look sort of strange.
If you want, I can go alone.
- Think so?
- Sure.
I'll go reconnoiter with the pilot.
- Then I'll see you at the hotel.
- You're right.
It's silly for both of us to go.
See you later.
Farewell, Perrin.
A wasp. Don't move.
- What?
- I'm allergic. Don't move.
Damn.
If it stings me, I'll die.
It's true.
Once I was in the hospital
for a week. I almost died.
I swell up and choke to death.
Do we have to wait long?
I don't know. It's not up to me.
Don't move.
Don't move, I said.
What is it doing?
Is it excited?
No, it's very relaxed.
Excuse us.
I don't care. I'm paid by the hour.
It looks sleepy.
What if it spends the night there?
Don't make me laugh.
If I laugh, I'm done for.
How are you?
That was a close shave.
I feel a bit queasy.
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I think so.
I'll go with you.
- Don't bother. I'll be okay.
- Then let's go.
It's no joke.
I really am allergic.
It's in the family.
My mom has asthma.
And when my grandmother
ate strawberries...
her face became
a mess of red pimples.
Off we go.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
A nail or a needle.
- May we smoke?
- Go ahead.
It was like an electric shock.
- Everything okay?
- Just perfect.
Are you sure?
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I tell you.
- That dumbbell Meyer.
- What?
Nothing.
Fantastic vegetation.
So abundant, so luxuriant.
Are you okay?
Sure, and you?
Mexico, a country of contrasts.
Land as soon as you can.
- Land as soon as possible.
- Why?
Oh, my God!
I'm choking to death.
Do you still need me?
No, you can go now.
You'll be okay.
There's a hospital nearby.
Thanks, Campana.
You're going to be all right.
- Okay now?
- Yeah, it's all over.
- He told me a crazy story.
- What?
His village burned down.
So what?
Come here.
Tell my friend
what happened in your village.
In his dreams he talks about a girl.
"Girl with round eyes come
and village burn."
Do you have Marie's picture?
Isn't that odd?
It's not a game.
Do you know that girl?
He won't answer.
He's in a state of shock.
What'll we do now?
Let's go to that village.
I didn't dare suggest it,
since you like logic.
No logic in my getting stung and...
Shut up!
There have been some
disturbing coincidences.
Noisy character.
I go on vacation in Spain
every year with my mother.
It's pretty there too.
But not like this.
So much has happened
since I met you.
To me too.
Not much left of it.
Anyone here?
Just as I thought.
They all left after the fire.
I was hoping someone would be here.
But it's too late.
- We won't find any of them now.
- Why not?
In this jungle, it's no easy job...
to find Indians who've seen
a girl with round eyes.
So that's it, then?
Hell, if I fail on this case,
I can't open my agency.
What?
Mr. Bens would have financed it.
I'd have become a detective.
I like this job.
It's tough, but it's exciting.
This has been
the opportunity of a lifetime.
I can tell you a secret now.
I haven't always been lucky.
Really?
Now be very frank with me, Campana.
Have I got a gift for this work?
Yes.
You see, I can't be
an accountant anymore.
Taking the bus every day,
being cooped up in an office.
After all this.
It's too dumb,
since I do have a gift for it.
Come on. Let's go back.
I would have hired you.
- We'd make a good team.
- We sure would.
Sure is dumb, that ape.
Did you see that?
Wasn't that crazy?
You need this more than I do.
What's gotten into you?
What's going on?
I saw an Indian.
I think he had glasses on.
Odd, an Indian with glasses.
What were they like?
- I forget.
- Did you really see them?
Yes... no.
I was driving and I thought,
"He's got glasses on."
- He must be far away by now.
- Those may have been Marie's glasses.
Or my aunt's brassiere!
You scared him.
We won't find him.
It's too hot and I'm fed up.
Don't move an inch.
Don't move.
What a moron!
Are you hurt, Campana?
Life was a bore before I met you.
Where are you going?
- To a mission 13 miles from here.
- What for?
They'll bandage your leg.
Forget it. It's only a scratch.
It might get infected.
Don't argue.
Is this the mission?
June 26th. Three weeks ago.
- Did an earthquake do this?
- I don't know.
Maybe a tornado.
Reminds me of
my parents' house near Paris.
A tornado in Paris?
No, I left the gas on and...
This area seems jinxed.
First the village, now this mission.
A series of disasters.
Right or left?
Right or left?
The road goes to the right.
It looks like a shortcut to the left.
- Which way?
- How do you feel about it?
- My instinct is to go left, but...
- Left.
We're lost.
We'll just go back.
I don't understand.
What is it?
I'm looking for Marie Bens
and she's not here.
There's nothing here.
I get involved in this shit
and now we're lost.
What's gotten into you?
A round-eyed girl. Glasses. Indians.
A gas explosion near Paris.
And I'm going nuts, that's what.
Move over, damn it.
Let me drive.
Got to find that road.
- Almost out of gas.
- What?
Enough for six more miles, no more.
It's not very crowded here.
- Okay, let's go.
- Nothing doing.
We haven't seen a car in 18 hours.
We could wait months.
Rule number one: Never leave the car.
We stay here.
I'm in charge, I decide,
and I say we leave!
And I say go to the car
and stop bugging me. That's an order.
An order?
Are you giving me orders now?
For your own sake, do as I say.
- I'm in charge.
- You are not.
What?
Do you know why they chose you?
You're just like Marie.
You can't take one step
without causing a disaster.
That's why they chose you.
You forced me to tell you.
We're lost because of
that nitwit Meyer...
and his theories on bad luck.
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is.
"Your deductive powers."
They were putting you on.
Sorry, but I don't want you
to die in this jungle.
Go get some sleep in the car.
I'll bash your face in.
It was their idea, not mine.
- Get ready.
- Don't be a fool. You'll only get hurt.
You'll hurt yourself.
Hurt yourself?
Look out for the tree.
Wait a second.
Okay, go ahead.
Now calm down.
Perrin! Can you hear me?
Poor dumbbell.
We're safe now.
They're going to take care of you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Must be a concussion.
Can you take X rays?
Don't worry.
We'll take care of him.
Do you have a surgeon?
He may need an emergency operation.
Don't worry.
Are you a relative?
Yes.
Take good care of him, please.
He hit his head, Mr. Bens.
He's in a coma.
I don't know yet.
I feel like I'm to blame.
That was a crazy theory.
I shouldn't have come.
No, don't feel guilty.
You wanted to believe it would work.
I almost did myself.
Where am I?
I don't know.
Do you hear the birds?
Yes, it's pretty.
Very pretty.
Where are we?
Where is he?
