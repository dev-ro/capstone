Nandini...
Let me sleep
"Happy birthday, brother.
- Many happy returns of the day"
"Carrot-halwa. You love it, don't you?
- Help yourself"
Go on
He's angry because Nandini
hasn't been married
What can I do? I tried so much
to convince her...
but she just doesn't approve
of a suitor
Try Patel's son...
- He's an ape! A monkey!
He's a monkey
And you shut up!
- We must fulfill our promise to him
"Without his support, I wouldn't have
had a roof over my head in Canada"
He was such a great man...
- So we must marry her off to a monkey?
What monkey?
He doesn't even have a tail
It's Papa's birthday
It's ten already and you still
haven't gone to the restaurant
You're always harping on my marriage!
You just aren't bothered about your work
Go on now... hurry up!
- But how about your marriage?
"Really? I'm going to report you
to Papa. See, Papa...?"
Where were you all these days?
Know how difficult it was to
get tickets to the concert?
"They're at the restaurant, where else?
Come here immediately"
What serious business
did you want to discuss?
You are our business partner
in this restaurant...
and you've been taking care of this
eatery for the last seven years
I haven't even received any salary
You have no one of your own. Shouldn't
you be thinking about yourself?
Why must I? You guys are here
to think about me
And so we've thought of
getting you married. To Nandini
Marry Nandini? Are you guys crazy?
- We know you're in love with Nandini
Don't you like Nandini?
- I do
But I've never thought of marrying her.
- There's no problem in thinking
Nandini won't find
a better boy than you
"Besides, you have no one
in the world"
The two of you will be so happy
if you are married to each other
lt'll make brother so happy too.
- True...
but Nandini's a very dear friend.
If I spoke marriage with her...
I'd probably be...
- Endangering your friendship?
The two of them mean everything to me
How can I get married and go away?
I could never do it
"Now tell me, how can I marry
a man I don't even know?"
"Someone must come along, marry me
and take me away"
Which movie did we see together?
Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge
"So you aren't going to get married?
- Oh no, let's see"
Will you marry me?
It's the call of the heart
"It's the call of my heart, my love.
Come to me"
"I wait for you...
do not torment me anymore"
"Come, drive my loneliness away"
"Everything is so dull without you.
Where are you...?"
Come to me
"You are the one I dream of,
you are the one I always think of..."
"you are the only one
who lives in my restless heart"
"So come to me, my love"
"It's the call of my heart, my love.
Come to me"
"I wait for you...
do not torment me anymore"
"Come, drive my loneliness away"
"Everything is so dull without you.
Where are you...?"
Come to me
"You are the one
I love to behold..."
"you are the shining star
of my fortunes"
"Come to me, my love"
"It's the call of my heart, my love.
Come to me"
"I wait for you...
do not torment me anymore"
"Come, drive my loneliness away"
"Everything is so dull without you.
Where are you...?"
Come to me
"My heart calls out to you.
Come to me, my love"
"I pine for you...
do not make me pine anymore"
"Come, drive my loneliness away..."
"for the world is bereft
of any excitement without you..."
where are you...?
What...? Where...?
How did it happen?
Where are you held up...?
What is the matter?
Don't worry. I'm coming over.
- What happened?
My uncle was coming to see me and the
police in Los Angeles caught him
It has something to do with
his passport. I must go there
"I'll go with you.
- No, I'm going with him"
I know those guys
"If Ballu's uncle has an immigration
problem, enquire at the lmmigration"
"But he was staying at your place,
wasn't he?"
Haven't they contacted him yet?
- Haven't you been contacted either?
Ask at the lmmigration
One moment
Ravi... how's Ma?
It's Shekhar here from Canada.
How's Ma...?
I can't hear a word.
How's Dadu?
It's Shekhar from Canada...
how's Ma?
Ravi... how's Ma?
It's Shekhar! From Canada!
"Who are you talking to, Shekhar?"
Who planted the bomb...?
Go there and check it out immediately.
Immediately...
"Say something, damn it!
It's Shekhar here!"
"Ravi, go to Ma! Go to Ma!
Lmmediately"
"Who are Ma and Dadu, Shekhar?"
Why do you need this money?
What is the matter?
Tell me what you are looking for
Why do you need the passport?
Where are you going?
Where are you going...?
I'm going with you too!
No!
Ma... my Ma...
Let's go. The train's leaving
in five minutes
Shekhar!
Uncle...?
- My boy!
My darling boy!
I was looking for you!
"Where have you been?
- I was in Canada, Uncle"
"This is my wife. And this is my son.
- Very sweet boy, I say"
And your wife is very beautiful too.
Very good looking...
"very tempting...
- We must leave now, Uncle"
"We might miss the bus,
we're getting late"
Go on. And do bring
your wife to my place
"She was sizzling, all right"
It felt as if I put my hand
on something steaming
She's going to be great fun!
She's a butter-ball...
an imported one at that
Where's Beechha?
Lay off!
Come on... get down!
"Get down, you bastard!"
See how he's struggling.
Get the bastard
Wait! Nobody shoots!
Can't you guys hear me?
Nobody shoots!
Wait there...
nobody shoots!
"Can't you bloody well hear me?
Nobody shoots, I say!"
Hear that...? Do you?
"What do you want to do, uncle?
Kill each other?"
Here... kill me! Kill me!
But nobody opens fire
Nobody fires!
Hurry up! Get the vans
out of here
Are you mad? Couldn't you
send word that you were coming?
"Had we not come on time,
I don't know what would happen today"
They'd have bumped him off!
- Shut up
"Who is she?
- How's Ma, Uncle?"
Where's Shekhar...?
Put that gun away!
"How are you, my friend?
- And how are you?"
"You aren't hurt, are you?
- Forget it. This place hasn't changed"
Where did you pinch this uniform from?
- What rubbish
I have become an Inspector.
And I'm posted in this very area
Let's talk in the car.
I've got to meet Ma
"At Dadu's? No, not today.
- Why not?"
Dadu's bound to hit back for this.
And I'll have to handle it
"Nandini... my wife.
And this Pratap, my childhood friend"
"He's actually seven years older,
but he says he's younger"
See you later.
- All right
Enough
Walk over it
Tell her! It's the custom.
- I can't do this
"How's Ma, Dadu?"
Is she all right?
"Where did you pick up this girl?
- It's Nandini, my wife"
"I wanted to tell you, but it happened
so suddenly. We got married in a temple"
"Your kid?
- Yes, he's my son"
What do you call him?
- Raja... Rajeshwar
Old man!
Well?
- Well?
"A tiger's cub, all right!"
Old man... take a look at this
Ask her to wear decent clothes
Here you are.
Your great grandson! Rajeshwar!
He has been named after you
The rascal got married out there
He didn't consider it necessary
to inform us
And this is his woman...
give them your blessings. Go on!
This is your great grandfather
"He can't move, he has no teeth...
but he's still a fighter"
"Your great grandson,
my grandson"
Greet him
Brother Shekhar!
You forgot all of us?
Sister-in-law! Hello!
And my nephew...
How's Ma?
- She's all right. Come with me
"He loves his mother very much...
been away for eight years, after all"
Why's he so late?
- Ma...
Are you all right?
- Well...?
Does anyone forget his Ma like this?
Where did you leave me and go away?
Don't you know?
I can't live without you
Every time the crow cawed
on the window-sill...
I said Shekhar was coming.
And you...?
You come after all these years?
And you're the only one I have
I'm here now... isn't it?
Isn't it?
Who's this girl?
- Your daughter-in-law
My daughter-in-law...?
Go and fetch the ceremonial plate
"You got married...?
Come, come and sit here"
May you be happily married
She looks like a real Goddess.
She's very beautiful
"Not better looking than I am, is she?
- She's far better"
What is your name?
- Nandini
I didn't ask you.
I want to hear her voice
What is your name?
Nice name
This is your grandson.
- His name is Raja
"How are you?
- I'm all right, brother"
"Nandini, this is my sister.
- Sister-in-law is very beautiful"
So they tried to kill my son
And who was it?
Your mistress's son
You weren't satisfied
with one wife
You will sacrifice my son to let my
step-mother's soul find peace
They'll shoot at Shekhar?
At Shekhar...?
Narsimha's entire family
is here right now
Let's finish all of them
and take control...
"of the mansion, 40 villages,
4000 families..."
they'll all be at your feet
Their women will be my whores...
and they will bear me bastards.
It'll sure be fun
"Guns, bullets, explosions...
and an obsession with revenge"
That's just what has happened
in this family... in this region
This is just the tradition that
has been passed down
The enemy isn't anyone else...
it's my own uncle
"After my sister's wedding,
we were on our way to a temple..."
when Uncle Beechha launched
a grenade attack on us
My brother-in-law was
blown to pieces
My sister's hands and my face
were smeared with blood
Grandfather lay motionless
and Dadu was screaming away
Although I'm the sole heir
in the family...
I wanted to go away
from all the violence
So I studied very hard
and went away to Canada
That is where I met you...
"and for the first time in my life,
I had found some peace"
"For fear of losing you,
I hid the truth from you"
But when I heard about Ma...
I couldn't stop myself
"I love my Ma very much, Nandini"
"Shekhar, I'm very scared"
"Nandini, I've come home
after a very long time"
I want to spend some days
with Ma
What are you whispering to him?
Eat all you want
"If you knew food gave you strength,
you wouldn't have been so spineless"
Here... have some chillis
"It strengthens your heart,
you'll at least be a real man..."
and you won't run away again!
Why're you bothering your son?
He has returned after so many years
You won't even let him eat in peace?
- Because of your mollycoddling...
he has become a bloody eunuch.
He ran away...
because you always pampered him.
You've made a coward out of him
"A paper-tiger! He won't roar,
he won't bite"
What is the matter?
- I'm not hungry
Madam doesn't like our food
Does she eat diamonds
in her country?
Why's he running after his wife...?
"Is he really my son,
or is he someone else's?"
"What happened, Nandini?"
"Are you all right?
- Yes Nandini, I'm fine..."
What happened...?
What is the matter?
Why are you so scared?
"Shekhar, I want to talk
to my Uncle Ballu"
"This one is better, isn't it?"
Shut up
Nobody's taking the phone at home.
- So try the cell-phone
The call just isn't going through.
I've tried so much
We'll try tomorrow.
Let's go... we're getting late
Must so many people accompany us
even when we want to make a phone call?
Well?
What happened?
"Sit down, sister-in-law"
Naughty!
See...
how does she look?
"Sit here, dear.
- No, you sit down"
Sit down quietly
Where did you run into our boy?
How did you hook him?
Tell us
"With folded hands,
greet all of them"
Namaste.
- Namaste
"Enough, go on"
"Hurry, we have a long queue"
I liked draping a sari
Your Ma is very nice
You think this is India?
At the American immigration office...
you try to bribe them
with 2000 dollars?
I thought it was time
they got used to taking bribes
"Got used, my foot!"
You're the one who ought to
get used to living in jail!
"Officer, here's 2000 Dollars"
Know what? These guys don't know
the value of money
"Had it been India, I'd have brought
them along in just 2000 rupees"
"You talk of bribes again...?
Thank God, brother had a reputation"
"Because of him, we got away"
"Else, we'd have to spend
our lives in jail"
"Because of you, I had to spend
a week in jail!"
"What's the big deal? In India,
several leaders spend time in jail"
I'm going to kill you!
Shekhar hasn't been going to the
restaurant for the last five days
Where could they...
"Kill him, Dadu... kill him!"
"Kill him, I say!
Hack him to pieces"
Dadu... hack him to pieces.
Kill him! Kill him!
What's happening here...?
Let him go... let go!
"Uncle, ask them to let go.
Uncle..."
Dadu... ask them to leave him alone.
Ask them to let Uncle go
They're going to kill him!
Ask them to let him go
Dadu... how long will we
continue with this bloodshed...?
"What good is bloodshed, Dadu?
Stop them, Dadu... stop them!"
"Come, Dadu... ask them to let him go!
Tell them to let him go!"
Tell her...
He didn't let the matrimonial
vermillion remain on my daughter
He lobbed a grenade
Your brother-in-law was
blown to pieces
It happened in front of your eyes.
Have you forgotten?
"Someone came carrying his head,
someone else bore a limb..."
is he going to return?
"I'm even willing to worship this man,
but will my son-in-law come back?"
"Forget the past, Dadu.
- My father ought to have killed him"
But they treat the old man like putty
The old man shits and pees in his bed
"So who will do the old man's job,
if not his son?"
Nobody's going to gain
anything out of this. Nobody
"Let him go, Dadu...
please let him go"
My wise son...
let me tell you something
Had this man slaughtered your son
and your wife...
would you still ask me
to let him go?
I'd have let him go...
I wouldn't kill anyone
You're an ass. A bloody ass
"If I let him go,
he's going to kill me"
Man does not kill man
because it's a blessing
He kills to save his own skin
"But why would you bother,
even if I died?"
You give a damn for your father anyway
You didn't miss your father
even once in eight years
"But the moment you heard about
your mother, you came running"
You're right. I had left this hell
But you're still leading the life
of a monster. A beast!
You don't have a shred of
humanity running in your veins
"If you kill him today, his son
will kill you and me tomorrow"
Blood and revenge...
for generations to come!
"What will you gain out
of this, Dadu? What?"
How many more women will
weep like my sister?
How many more lives
is it going to ruin?
For how long are they
going to live in terror?
"I beg of you, Dadu...
let him go! Leave him alone!"
"All right, I'll let him go.
I'll leave him alone"
But we'll have to flee this place.
Like docile women...
and where will we go?
To your madam's land?
"40 villages, 400 families
and the estates..."
I shoulder all the responsibility.
I keep their kitchen fires going
And where will they go?
He'll raze them to ashes
Do what you want to!
- He'll raze them to ashes
He'll turn the place into a graveyard.
Women will cultivate their bodies...
and be enslaved to men.
And dogs will pee on our family name!
"All right, do whatever you wish.
But I'm going to have uncle released!"
Let him go! Let go!
Take him away
Kick him out
"Dadu, you'll have to regret this!
Kill him today..."
"and his men will kill you tomorrow,
they will kill me. Let him go!"
"Kick him out. Looks like I've
sired a pig, not a son"
"Raja, go inside"
"Have some peanuts, city boy.
- Take him inside, Nandini"
We've killed your assassin
The drum-beat...
The drum-beat...
the drum-beat resonates
"You and I dance...
we sway"
Under the gleaming swords...
the anklets chime
The drum-beat...
"This soil we love...
we are proud of it"
"We're the stirring winds
that will uproot the enemy"
We stand like the tall mountains
"In his shadow, we live"
He has a heart as vast as the ocean
We worship fire
"Under the gleaming swords
the anklets chime"
You are our lord and master
We adore you
"Taking lives is nothing...
we can even lay down our lives"
The soil of your feet...
"is worthy of being
applied to our foreheads"
Beholding you is like...
"being granted a visitation
by the Lord"
The drum beats...
"You and I dance...
we sway"
Under the gleaming swords...
the anklets chime
The drum-beat...
What airs! The young one
is really showing off
Dancing like Madhuri Dixit
What is it?
People say that a murder...
"No, I know there couldn't
have been a murder here"
"But I'm in the police department.
I'll have to do my duty, you see"
But nothing has happened here.
Had there been something...
"I'd surely have
got to know, isn't it?"
Go away... get lost
The water here doesn't suit Raja.
He's had a cough for two days...
he has a fever too
I'm not being able to
talk to uncle either
The telephone lines here
are so bad
We'll come again to meet Ma
That's what I've been
thinking about too
I'll tell Ma tomorrow
that we're leaving
"Sit down, son. You sit down too"
Take the measurements
What are you doing?
- Just stand here
21...
22...
35...
- What is this?
30...? Your tummy's all dried up.
Don't you get food to eat out there?
Turn around now.
21...
Don't behave like a girl.
Give her the measurements
"What's going on, Ma?
- Mind the measurements, tailor"
Won't I have him hacked
if he messes up?
"It's got to be as good as
the ones from the city, okay?"
"What's all this about, Ma?
- Don't you remember?"
"Four days later is your birthday.
- Oh, Ma! I forgot"
You don't even remember your Ma.
You've forgotten everything
But I remember.
- Which is why you're my Ma
"Lovely bangles you're wearing, Ma!
Nandini, aren't they beautiful?"
Tell me what you want to.
Don't flatter me
"Ma, we want to go back tomorrow"
Raja hasn't been keeping well.
The water here doesn't suit him...
"and Nandini's scared too.
I'd have stayed over, but..."
"Have a word with Dadu.
He'll flare up, if I say something"
Only you can get us
the permission to leave
"You understand what I say, don't you?
- I understand everything"
You just don't want to live here
But you've only left home...
you haven't left my heart
But a mother will always
want to see her son
"After all those prayers and oaths,
those temples and medicines..."
you were born to me
like a boon
But look at my misfortune.
You can't live with your mother
It's ages since I cooked
porridge on your birthday
"Let me have the satisfaction
at least this time, my son"
"For your Ma's sake, please stay on
for just four days"
I beg you
"You will stay, won't you?
You will stay...?"
"Yes, Ma"
Welcome!
You've put on a lot of weight
"Well, ass?
Where have you been?"
"After the elections,
you just vanished"
You did them all in?
You made a lot of money?
"And you forgot, you used to make
bombs in this very house"
I helped him fight the elections.
And as soon as he becomes a minister...
his backside gets as big as a melon
"There are no roads in the village,
no water, no hospitals..."
but he enjoys his chicken
in the hotels
He has his booze and
strips young girls
But that's how politics is.
It makes a dog out of man
And it gives power to a dog...
like him
"You've ruled enough, ass.
I'll fight the elections now"
Why're you staring at me? I'm not
making my wife the Chief Minister
So what if I'm illiterate
and have a foul tongue...?
"As long as I wield the stick,
I am the legislator here"
But you needn't worry.
I'll give you work...
what is that?
- Polling agent
You do recognise your worth
Go away... the sight of you
makes my tiger cry. Go
Look at the tiger in the nude!
These politicians are
not to be trusted
They'd even sell their mothers
So what's the plan? Tell me.
I'll bring Narsimha
out of his house
But killing him is your responsibility.
He mustn't escape
I'm going to fight the
elections this time
Tell me something... you have
the stomach to kill Narsimha?
"Truth is that after my brother was
killed, my heart has been on fire"
"For this very purpose, I have had
a gunman called from far away"
He has committed three murders.
The first was his own father
He ripped the old man apart
at a liquor den
How many men have you killed?
There's no count. None at all
Just show him the money and
the way he kills... he's too much
"Look, Mister...
don't go back on your word"
"I want Narsimha dead, that's all.
You mustn't die instead"
You mustn't die
"A tiger's grandson, after all.
Give me the lighter"
Nothing's going to happen.
Hold this
Light it up and blow 'em up
How's he going to rule the world
if he doesn't hurl grenades?
This one didn't even explode.
Are you guys making bombs or sweets?
"If this one doesn't explode,
you guys are going to face the music"
"Step aside... step aside, I say.
- Come to me"
Wasn't that an explosion!
Let go...
- Let him be
How will he manage
if he doesn't learn?
Why're you hitting the child?
- Who the hell are you to ask me?
Go away
What sort of a man are you to
give explosives to a child?
The skies haven't fallen
if we blew up a bomb
You ought to be ashamed! If the
bomb had gone off in his hands...
he could have lost a limb...
anything could have happened
This child is no bomb
you can replace with another
What madam...? Do you eat fodder
to act like an animal?
You give him a bomb?
Don't you have any brains?
He's your son's son!
Don't you understand that much?
You're an animal anyway.
You want to make my son like you?
"I made a mistake, so forgive me..."
Let me and my son be.
Leave us alone
What's happening in
this hell-hole?
"You lied that you had no one,
but this animal...?"
They're all your flesh and blood.
- Let's go inside and talk
I find it so suffocating here
"The three of us. Let's go, please!
- But what is the matter?"
What is the matter? He was
teaching Raja to burst a grenade
"You're proud of him, aren't you?
But he's a beast! A wild animal!"
"He applies the holy mark on his
forehead, he cuts up a goat..."
and he turns your sister
into a widow!
He broke her bangles and
he sent that man's head rolling...
He's a killer.
A bloody killer!
Why must you put up with it? Take your
wife and get the hell out of here
"Idiot, it's my birthday
on the fifth"
And you know my mother. She starts
crying the moment I talk about leaving
Won't I have to stay till my birthday?
So keep your advise to yourself...
and do something for me. Book three
tickets to Canada for the 6th
Here are the passports.
- I'll do it right today
Here's the money. Nobody must
get to know about this
"No, I'm not going to the Collector"
I barged into the Chief Minister's
bungalow yesterday...
and said I'd resign if there was
no development in your area
"He immediately rang up the Collector
and said threateningly, if there..."
"is no development in Dadu's area, you
will regret where you are transferred"
"Dadu, the Collector panicked.
He wants to meet you right now"
Take off your spectacles...
are you shy to show me your eyes?
You want me to go and
meet the Collector?
I carry a dozen collectors
in my pocket
What an ass!
Where are you sending him?
Kali Ghadi. Maharaj's men
go hunting there
We'll bump off a few oldies there.
- Shut up
"You ought to go and meet him, Dadu"
Here's the chance to have some
development in this region
"It has to do with 40,000 people.
It could benefit everyone"
At least meet the Collector
I'm an illiterate man...
not me
"Dadu, you must fight
the elections"
"Once you've won, you can do
anything for this area"
But you'll have to meet the Collector
and other officials to do that
Know what? I'll go and meet the
Collector and bring him here
"Once you've met him, you won't
have anymore hesitation"
So what if you're illiterate?
I'm an educated man
Who will do the father's job
if not his son?
It would be better if you came
One of you go with him
It's the first time he's
standing in for his father
Nothing... go on
Get the car out.
Hurry up
You come along too
What're you looking there for?
Come on
"One minute, uncle..."
He's making signs to his wife!
You must take care of Dadu
during the elections
"If he wins, it'll improve the lot
of the people in the region..."
and your lot too.
And stop all that blood-letting
Or you'll get killed some day.
And what happens of your loved ones?
Don't you guys know what suffering
a fatherless child goes through?
We ought to get together
and make Dadu see reason
I'm going to meet Uncle Maharaj...
- No
I surely will. And reason with him
to help Dadu in the elections...
here's the opportunity
to bury the hatchet
Right?
- Stop the car!
What happened?
You know how he was killed sir
"How did this happen, Dadu?"
Who committed the murder?
- I don't know
"The police won't be able to do
anything, if you don't tell us"
Don't do anything then.
Just go away
The post-mortem...
Get the hell out of here!
Get lost!
"Raja, wake up"
Let's go... we're leaving
Where are we going?
- Home. We're going home
Where is Papa?
What are you doing? His body's
lying here and you're leaving?
Let my son's last rites
be performed by his son
Or his soul will never find peace
I beg you... please don't go away
Please don't go away
"Papa, get up"
"Papa, wake up"
You are destined to have a void...
"in the skies,
is your abode"
"Loneliness is your
only companion..."
and this is your last journey
Away from the land of misery...
away from cries of agony...
away from the oceons of hatred...
Away from the fire...
that sets hearts ablaze
Away from the fire...
Where is your husband?
I'm not sparing him
His grown up son is dead.
Narsimha's beside himself in agony
He's hopping mad
in his mansion
