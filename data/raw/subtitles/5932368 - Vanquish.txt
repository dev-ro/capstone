[Damon] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.
Proceed.
You already know my sins, Tom.
I do.
And also already know
that I've stepped off the righteous path.
Well, we all have.
A million six from the South side.
Drug money was a little light this month,
and prostitution was down a little too,
under 800,000.
Gambling's up. The skim was
a million one last month.
Is there any way to come back to the path?
Are you serious?
I'm not sure.
But it feels good to contemplate it.
[Fr. Tom] I am a friend,
and I do not have the spiritual answer
you're looking for.
There's a woman...
- Your caretaker?
- Yes.
- Are you having impure thoughts?
- No, no, no.
She's in a tough spot with her daughter.
And you want to help.
It would help me to help her.
- How about the pickups?
- Same spots.
I hear there's a problem.
- Same problem?
- Yes.
Ahem. That rumor's been around forever.

The description matches you to a T.
Fight it, Vic.
I never saw my friend again.
- Nor the money.

Later I learned that that was
what you and brother did.
You guys stole cash from couriers

You seduced He-Rod.

Okay, why is that?
Well, the officer that bit it tonight?
You're lucky you took him out

And, uh...
you're lucky to have the FBI
as your new partners.
All right, so what's this gonna cost?
Well, you know, peace of mind
don't come cheap.
I didn't think it would.
They were just about to go to the DEA.
They?
Homeland Security,
the whole nine yards.
No, no, no, now you said they.
Who's they?
Well, before we get into that,
you and I are gonna have

We want half.

- Half?

Half the whole operation.

Hello.
Damon?
That's right.
What are you doing
answering Childs' phone?
Well, he's dead.
He's what?!
Yeah. I shot him.
And he's dead?
I'm pretty sure.
You're kidding me! What happened?
Well, you'd have to ask him.
So you're not gonna elaborate?
He came into my home,
didn't say a word, pulled a gun on me,
so I shot him.
And you had no idea?
I'm sure he had a good reason.
We just didn't have time to talk.
[sighs]
Well, the Feds said Rick has a partner.
Hmm... Maybe Childs.
I never liked him.
Trusted him even less.
Okay, well, they want half of everything.
Well, they could have asked for more.
And you're good with that?
You've got my vote.
[chuckles]
Well, okay.
So I guess everybody
is gonna have to weigh in.
Hmm. Well, get the tapes, start listening.

That's not an accident.
That's been designed.
Ah, designed.
Clearly, yes, by Damon.
Why tonight?

He's never asked for your help before,
