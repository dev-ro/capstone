l truely don't even know
why i'm here doctor.
Well of course it difficult
running a large household by one self...
and raising four children is exact thing.
But they're wonderful, wonderful children.
And my husband...
he's a good man. A very hardworker.
And uhh...
[clear throat]
There were...there is just...one thing...
Sometimes at night...
and it comes to me.
l imagine myself...
splitting his fat, bold head
with a great large axe.
lt just a feeling that comes over me
many...many times a day...
a feeling of umm...
expectation, aah...
hungering.
[Crying]
How do you bear it, this English weather?
l cannot sing from the sadness.
I opened my mouth...
[Sing terribly]
You see?
Nothing.
[Sobbing]
[Continue crying]
Well and with my dear Allister's gone
this two years now l...
l should thought l'm fall,
far too old for this kinds of feelings...
but well, there they are...
Nurse!
l ask you to clean this wound
and put on fresh bandages.
umm...
Dr. Richardson told me
not to waste supplies.
ls he mad? No...
we must keep the wound
clean to prevent sepsis.
- What 'sis'?
- Sepsis.
lnfection. lt's caused by germs
entering the wound.
Germs. They're tiny creatures
that invade the body.
Causing pain, fever,
infections.
l don't think l have those.
-You can't see them.
They're invisible.
Please, just fetch me a beaker of carbolic acid solution and fresh bandage.
Yes, doctor.
Honestly...
ugh...That oaf Richardson had this way
with perform surgery in the sewer
using rusty saws
and it would be Beekman's pills for everybody.
no matter the ailment...
-Granville.
l'm aware l specifically told the nurse
not to change this bandages.
Soiled bandages are a heaven for germs.
Germ's theory is poppycock, Granville.
Now stop speaking of it.
You're frightening the patients.
Poppycock? But Lister has proved it.
All the latest journals...
-Hide, Granville.
No, we won't be needing those.
Thanks very much.
A study there of calm reissurance
and regular bleeding.
These are the keys to modern medicine.
Will you remain calm, when the
leg putrefies  and become gangreness?
Will you amputate...
when the rots spread to her blood and kills her?
l've had quite enough
of your impotenance.
Put back that bandage and bleed a pint.
Look...look at her, man.
You...you get more blood out of a turnip.
Do as you're told.
And give her Beekman's pills for insurance.
Beekman's pills are rubbish.
They will do nothing but
bring on stomach cramps.
l won't stand here and watch you murder your patients
just because you can't be bothered
to read the latest science.
Hahahahaha...
At long last
we agree, Granville.
Bloody dinosour.
Oh...
Huh...
Good day Mrs. Copeland.
ls Edmund in?
l wouldn't know, sir.
Guess it all nows my part is
delivery stay at night.
lf l didn't love his parent, so l will never stay.
l pack my bags,
and all this electrical equipment.
lt's a fire hazard, thats what it is.
l'll try his study.
You. Why have you stop?
[lndistinct chatter]
Ow!
Now, that is not what you're suppose to do.
[Door open]
Hello.
[Humming]
Ughh...
Oh no.
You haven't been sacked again, have you?
l've tell you, Edmund.
The healing arts in England are positively lethal.
lt's no coincident but the morgues
are placed adjacent to the hospitals.
-Haha...
Well, this is 1880's.
We're meant to be in the mid's of a medical revolution.
ls it asking too much to use just
a bit of what science have provided.
Rather than...go about indiscriminately killing people?
Yeah, well a little bit like that.
What's all the fuss outside?
My new generator.
You purchase a generator
just last year.
Obsolete. This was half the size
and leave this double the power.
l never thought l say this. But...
l've lost hope.
Since l was a boy, all l wanted was
to practice medicine.
And to help...
people that actually needed it.
But l'm beginning to fear
that the world is set against me.
Well, what you gonna do?
Private practice, l suppose.
I shall harness myself
to some greedy pill pusher.
Shut my mouth.
And pray that it nets me a steady income.
Or, I could give you ten thousand pounds,
so you could what ever you wish.
uhh...I've told you a thousand times, Edmund.
You and your family done
quite enough for me already.
Oh, come on, Mortimer.
l don't really missed it.
That's not the point.
I simply must make my own way in the world.
You're so wonderfully middle class.
Haha..
Thank you.
Oh, by the way.
There seems to be a young man
sleep on your stairs.
Really?
Huh...
[Clear troath]
Good Morning.
Mortimer Granville to see Dr. Dalrymple.
l have an appointment.
He's with someone now.
l see. Very well.
l shall wait, then.
Ladies.
Ladies.
Umm...
Ahh...
It's lovely.
Japanese, I think.
You're a charlatan...
with no more idea
of a woman's wants or needs than
of...of the Moon's atmosphere.
Charlotte, I simply want you to behave...
You maybe unaware, but there is a sosial revolution of foods.
Women, will no longer be deny our rightful place.
Try, if you might.
To keep us in a kitchen and in a brewing room.
We will not rest.
Until we are welcome in a universities,
in a profesions and in a voting booth.
What are you staring at?
Yes, l can see the will's turning.
Pity l can't stay for the pronouncement.
Charlotte!
That woman was...
Hysterical.
Yes, quite.
lt's very difficult case, that one.
Huh...
I have worked at a numbered
of hospitals in the past...
year.
Guy's of course, Charing Cross.
The Westminster Hospital, most recently...
Excellent.
-St Thomas's
Old St Thomas's
The popular in Stepney sick asylum...
Good. Impressive.
...the disease of the chest. Royal Sea Bathing Infirmary...
Fine...fine.
lt's...lt's a variety of experiences.
But, tell me doctor...
what do you know of hysteria?
Huh...
Nothing.
Nothing?
But it's a plague of our time.
I would vent you to say,
that half the women in London are affected.
lt stands from an overactive uterus.
And it most severe forms,
it demands drastic measures.
lnstitutionalisation, surgery even.
But in it's milf of amount of manifestation:
Nymphomania, frigidity,
melancholia, anxiety,
it's eminently treatable.
Interesting.
Look. l'll come straight to the point, doctor.
I'm keen for help.
Oh, you saw my waiting room.
Not enough hands to do the work, so to speak.
Sir, I would be enormously greatful
for any position that allowed me
to offer relieve to my patients
with little chance of killing them.
I've treated thousands of cases,
and l'm not lose a single patient.
But I won't lie to you, Granville.
lt's tedious, tiring work.
Are you fit?
I have never shook from hardwork in the
pursuit of helping the most needy among us.
Jolly, good.
Shall we say, umm...three pounds a week?
Three pounds?
Four.
Plus food and lodging.
I accept.
We going to do great things together, Granville.
Good golly, what a grip.
So, breakfast at eight, dinner at six.
Your room is up...ahh...
Emily.
I want you to meet my new assistant.
Dr. Mortimer Granville.
My daughter, Emily Dalrymple.
Your servant, ma'am.
So pleased to meet you, Dr. Granville.
Emily is the angel of the house.
Since the day of my wife, Melodia have past away,
Emily has run things in proper order.
Oh, and she's also quite a scientist in her own write.
You boast, Father.
Let me guess.
Geology?
[Both chuckles]
Botany?
Lepidopterology?
Phrenology.
-Phrenology...hahahaha...Yes.
l can assure you Phrenology
is an accurate science, doctor.
Yes, besides amilation of the bump
someone had a very detail map to the personality,
if one is propably change to read them.
l don't mean to imply...
l think a demonstration is in order
for our young skeptic.
it could be the most compatible.
Please.
What...
Dr. Granville, you had the most
perfectly formed nimbus l've ever felt.
nimbus?
He is a man of great wisdom.
l knew it. l knew it
And your mastoid is...is very well pronounce.
Doctor, you're quite simpathetic, aren't you?
Umm...well...
What else...what else?
Oh...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-What?
lt's just...
Well your...your thrombus is so...rigid,
so jotting and prominent, it startle me.
Rigid thrombus?
Sorry. Rigid thrombus?
lt's ogle's fame.
No, no, no...
While l have the utmost respect for your method, Mr. Dalrymple
l must complaint that you misread me.
l'm but a simple doctor.
l have no ambition for notoriety.
And l can assure you, your thrombus is the key to you future.
Wether you seek it or not, Dr. Granville.
You're destined for fame.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Who is this?
Who is this, please?
Mr. Stanton...Huh.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
This is Edmund St. John Smythe.
No, I don't work at
the telephone exchange. You see...
l've install this telephone and l wanted to test it
you're the only person
they could connect me to. Haha...
How things going over there?
Sound's thrilling. Very well.
Carry on then. Goodbye.
Do you realize?
l have been speaking to a barrister
on the other side of London.
What about it?
Nothing. l don't even know the job.
Nothing to value if you
have nothing to speak about?.
Here l am in Grosvenor Square,
and he's miles away
yet, we able to speak
to each other instantenously.
Do you think they'll catch on?
l have no idea.
But imagine if everyone had one.
Right.
Well...
l have just been offer a position
by London leading specialist in women's medicines.
Oh, God...
How ghastly for you.
When do you start?
Tomorrow.
Quite looking forward to it, actually.
Who is she?
What?
Hmm?
She's his daughter.
Emily Dalrymple.
l've only met her briefly, but...
But what?
Oh, Edmund. She is magnificent.
The epitome of English virtue and...
Womanlyness.
I haven't the hope.
Huh. Handsome, young doctor.
What more could woman ask?
Huh, better income. Social equal.
Overrated.
A few laugh, stiff prick. That what he got one.
And you know this because?
Oh, l've read it in a magazine.
Oh, l see.
A toast then. To the end of
Dr. Mortimer Granville, once brilliant student,
most recently,
visionary doctor to the poor,
and now, handmade to anxious middle-aged women.
Edmund St. John Smythe.
Bachelor.
Benefactor. Miserable student.
Sometimes drunked.
Full time sexual deviant and
supreme waster of time and money,
especially if it has anything to do with the science of electricity.
- To the telephone.
- To the Queen.
To calling the Queen on the telephone.
Morning, Mrs. Parsons.
Oh, good morning, Doctor.
This is Dr. Granville.
He'll be assisting me this morning.
Very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Parsons.
Doctor...
Notice the general pallor.
And how are we
this morning, Ms. Parsons?
Still feeling anxious?
It's quite anxious, doctor.
I've been having those distracting thought we discuss all week.
Yes.
Through out history,
the medical establishment just
offered hysterical women
a veritable small respond order of treatments.
Warm baths, ice baths, water jets,
mesmerization,
horse back riding even.
But, l favor
a more direct approach.
Now, l like to begin
with a drop of musk oil...
followed by oil of lilies.
good dollop.
Are you ready, Mrs. Parsons?
Yes...yes, doctor. Quite ready.
Ooh...
Now, you begin with the index finger.
Applying gentle pressure.
And slowly...
slowly in a circular motion,
still pressing gently.
lt's a bit like tapping your head
and rubbing your tummy at the same time.
But you certainly get the hang of it.
Vulva massage was popularized by Pieter Van
Foreest in the 16th century.
Who prescribed it
most especially for widows
and women of religious orders.
- No offense, Mrs Parsons.
- None taken, Doctor.
But today, in a clinical
environment with a trained professional
this is the most direct,
most effective treatment we can offer.
Good steady pressure.
Thats the key.
Oh...Thank you, doctor. Thank you.
Of course,
reapply oil as needed.
Notice the effect, Doctor?
Shortness of breath.
Blushing of the skin.
Fluttering of the eyelids,
twitching.
Mourn crimson.
Vocalization. All perfectly normal.
Merely, uninvoluntary
physiological reaction to the treatment.
Oh...Oh, come on!
Come on, boy!
Up and over!
Steady on, Mrs. Parsons. Steady on.
Put steady pressure.
Thats the key of it all.
Tally-ho!
Tally-ho!
Steady she goes, Mrs. Parsons.
Steady she goes
ls she's by fierce external stimulation,
we're able to elicit the pain pleasure reaction,
there by inducing the hysterical paroxysm,
and causing the uterus back to its normal position.
Amazing.
The female organ is as you know
incapable of experiencing
any pleasurable sensation what so ever
without actual penetration,
of the male organ.
Arghhh...
As you can see, Granville.
A very satisfactory paroxysm.
Well, l think we can judge this treatment a great success,
What do you say, Mrs. Parsons?
Startling, Dr. Dalrymple.
How a full demonstration.
And those nagging thoughts?
Gone, Doctor.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
So, same time next week.
Umm...
Same time tomorrow, l should say.
Moderation in all things, Mrs. Parsons.
Moderation in all things.
ls that you, Sarah?
Hello.
Ow...miss me, Charlie!
Sauce, sir?
It's lovely with the fish.
Thank you.
My father was Anglican minister
at Mortlake.
Unfortunately, he and mother
perished in the last cholera outbreak.
when l was a boy.
After coming to London to voluntere,
they contracted the disease themselves.
Oh, how dreadful.
Oh, terrible.
No doubt thats where you came your interest in medicine.
Lord St. John Smythe,
knew of my fate and without thought of the cause,
brought me into his own home
and provided for my welfare and education.
Just what you'd expect from a man of his standing.
There is no greater charity
than the gift of education.
You read the book of Samuel Smiles?
ls there anyone more sensible,
more supremely British.
Quite.
Music, philosophy,
phrenology,
you're woman of many talents Ms. Dalrymple.
lt's through generosity, through compassion,
through simple Christian kindness,
and England gospel is spread
through all those who hunger...
Hello, Father.
l'm so sorry l'm late.
Charlotte...
Emily, hello. Love you.
Good evening, Charlotte.
Molly, hello?
Staying out of trouble, l heard?
Most days, miss. Wine?
Yes, please.
You remember my daughter, Charlotte Dalrymple...
Daughter?
-My new assistant, Dr. Mortimer Granville.
Oh, hello. Lovely to meet you properly.
Careful not to prick yourself, Doctor.
What...oh!
You are aware that the dinner begin at six.
l'm so sorry.
Lizzie Burke had her eighth baby today. A little girl.
She was turn wrong way
around, she took forever to get her out.
It was unbelievable.
Must be speak of such thing at the table?
Emily.
Dr. Granville.
How is your fish?
Very fresh and very flaky, thank you.
And Emily, are the parsnips to your liking?
Oh...thats enough, Charlotte.
Only trying to make the conversation sufficiently benign.
Dr. Granville
What say you?
Childbirth. Nasty, uncomfortable
topic best avoided at supper
or miracle of life suited for any setting?
l believe that serious medical matters,
are best left to those who trying to know.
The lane Doctor remind me,
but can only study his scalpel with a quart of gin.
What say you, then?
Charlotte is the mistress at the
Eastern Settlement, House of Heaven for the less fortunate.
lt's unfortunately,
the experiences left her without a sense of
punctuality or decorum.
Oh, that probably true.
l suppose l should've said to Lizzie,
"Hold tight darling,
will be a minute. Just to pop home.
Mustn't be late for supper"
l don't know why you bother coming here at all
if your soul intention is to be disrupted.
lt isn't my soul intention.
We're out of coal again
and l need ten pounds.
No, no, no, no.
I already told you yesterday,
l'm not giving you any further support in that regard.
l know you did but
l didn't think you mean it.
Well if that what it takes to
bring to your senses, so be it.
l've been dodge you too long.
l've allowed you to roam the
street of London late at night.
Streets that l would be frighten
to go into in broad daylight.
l've taken into my own home the employer...
inexperience maid at your request. But no more.
And father please give me my dowry.
Haha...
What...Then you wasted on
prostitute and factory workers? l don't think so.
No, no. Not until you marry.
I would rather offer
myself to a band of ravenous Cossacks.
-The parsnips are delicious. Are they not?
l do find they work wonderfully
with the fish. Don't you think
it's not the Middle Ages.
She will able to marry whoever she pleases.
No! lt's not proper.
Now you give up this settlement house
and step up to your responsibility.
And until you do so,
l will not give you another penny.
And l won't come here anymore.
Not the charity or the company.
And you may threaten me with privation, with bankruptcy,
with a life that knows only hunger and squalor.
But l shall never veer, from what l know
to be my own true path.
And don't slam...
Did she slam every door?
Very difficult case, that one.
Good night, Doctor.
How is it, Miss Dalrymple that...
you are so much the ideal one.
And your sister is so...
so volatile?
well, l'm hardly ideal, Doctor. And...
Charlotte, she just...
feels everything so strongly.
lf you truely knew her, you would see she's
terribly clever and wonderfully cherishable
If she's earn such love and admiration
from one so kind and gentle as yourself,
l should never speak faultly of her.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night, Miss Dalrymple.
Don't, Frank.
How are you, this morning?
We doing fine.
He just misses his mother.
You know what...l was thinking about you this morning.
Do you know what we gonna start with?
Drawing.
Pardon me.
lt's quite alright, handsome.
Molly, is it?
That's right, sir.
But my friends call me Molly the Lolly.
And l think that we can be friend.
Molly the Lolly.
That's unusual nickname.
Fancy a lick?
No, no. Thank you.
Only six buck for the gentleman like yourself.
lt will only take me a minute.
Well, lt's a generous offer, l'm sure.
But l have a very busy day ahead of me.
So, so, so...perhaps another time, okay?
No, no, no. What l mean to say is...
What I meant...
Will if you excuse me.
Suit yourself.
You alright, Fannie?
Yeah...
lt's nothing.
Fannie, what is it? What?
lt's George.
Again.
l think he's gonna land us on the street.
This time
- Oh, no, no, miss. l can't
- No, take it. Take it.
Straight to the landlord.
Not stopping.
l see you tonight.
Mrs. Bellamy, is it?
I'm Dr. Granville, Dr. Dalrymple new associate.
Good morning.
Very pleased to meet you, Doctor.
You've been here before?
- Yes.
So you are aware of the procedure?
lndeed.
Going well?
Yes, quite. Thank you.
As l said before, l'm leaving you
in very good hands, Mrs. Bellamy.
Oh..hahaha...
Thank you, doctor.
Good day.
Shall we begin?
Sorry about that.
- You alright, Doctor?
- Yes, quite. Thank you.
Here we go, then.
Please let me know if
anything is uncomfortable.
That's very nice, Doctor. Thank you.
Very nice, indeed.
Aren't you understand? lt's an emergency.
The situation is desperate.
lt's completely impossible, madam.
l'll do anything.
Mille grazie.
You are very welcome, Signora.
Next.
You knew they turning patients away.
Really? l hadn't notice.
l think because of you.
This may be broken.
Something wrong with your hand?
Just a twinge.
Allow me.
You seem to settle in nicely, Dr. Granville.
Now, you may have noticed that l'm
not getting any younger.
And with only two daughters,
l had no one to carry on the practice.
l was wondering wether you might like to consider
becoming a partner.
Father. That's a wonderful idea.
l...l'm speechless.
And who knows if things go well,
this practice may end up your's.
Since my dear wife Melodia, past away...
God rest her soul.
Emily has diligently and professionally manage the household.
l've no doubt that one day
she would make a fine Doctor's wife,
with that experience.
Lovely.
l do hope l'm not expected
to stay here until after supper, everyday.
l'm very sorry, Ms. Smalley,
l'll be on schedule tomorrow. l promise.
l do hope so.
Right. Just in here.
We'll sit you down.
Miss Dalrymple, what a surprise?
l'm afraid that your father isn't here.
Good.
Well in that case l must tell you
that we work only to appointment.
Fannie has broken her ankle.
l was hoping to persuade you to treat it?
l'll have the fish n chips.
That's the rum talking.
lt's all l had to ease the pain.
Normally l don't recommend extreme drunkeness,
but it's probably a very good choice.
Let have a look at it.
l should tell you, we've no money.
Good night, Mrs. Smalley.
Oh..Good night.
Let's take her inside.
- Thank you.
l'm not wearing any knickers.
Well, l'm sure it's an honest mistake.
You wanna look?
- What are these for?
- I'll explain later.
There we go.
- Lie back.
Very good.
Now, Fannie...
- Yes.
l want you to count to three for me.
Can you do that?
Yes, l think so.
One,
two...
Owww!!
You said three, bloody hell!
She's out, l think.
Forgive me. l wanted her thought else where.
l need some plaster, for her ankle.
You didn't know my father had any
proper medical supplies in here anymore?
Crimean War's supplies l imagine.
Your hand alright?
lt's a bit stiff actually.
Why are you so oppose to your father?
My father...
You know he's never been
to the settlement house.
l simply wish he helped people
like Fannie who really need it
lnstead of the trivial work he'd have here.
lt's hardly trivial.
That one is a little bit sloppy, thank you nurse.
My apologize.
Hysteria is a disabling condition
affects half of women in London.
lt's you busy, l see.
Does wonder you've been disagreeable personality.
You find me disagreeable?
l've only ever seen you shouted people and slam doors.
At least l've got the courage of my convictions.
And few friends, l would imagine?
Good.
Well, l'll only to see you again
in six weeks, Fanny, to remove the cast.
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.
Yes, you've been a great help.
You're both very welcome.
lf you ever get bored, of nervous housewives
feel free to pay us a visit.
Hello, Mortimer.
Please, sit down.
Emily...
l've been...Oh, Emily...
l've been thinking...
should things progress
as your father suggested
and l one day l inherit the practice,
what would your feelings be, about...
well, an arrangement?
Mortimer...
l should be honored.
Most especially as it will make father so happy.
Right...right.
Umm...
Oh, that's settled.
Duty first, as always, Emily.
Life is of little value unless it be consecrated by duty.
Oh...Quite, yes.
Granville.
A word?
l must insist that you give Charlotte
no further assistants of any sort.
lt merely prolongs her relationship
with those people and that place.
The woman had a broken ankle.
l admire your dedication, Doctor.
But we can't have day labors
trade things through the office.
This is a very exclusive
and l might add, lucretive practice.
Appearances matter.
l have taken a solemn oath, Sir.
l thought we had an understanding, you and l...
about your future here.
That's last of it, Miss.
Oh, Jack. Thank you.
Well, then. lt's a two hundred late today
plus what's on account...
three carry to one...
seven and six, l think.
Yes...yes, that's right.
May l pay you Friday next?
l'm sorry, miss. But the govern are very clear.
Cash only, he said. And, get the balance.
Would you tell your employer,
that my father, Dr. Dalrymple,
has absolutely promise a very large donation
to the settlement house this coming Friday
and l'll will bring him the money myself.
l'll make a state, miss.
Nobody'll more appreciate more
than me what you've done here.
My boy, Frank says you're
strawberry and the cream.
Just shut...Friday, then.
- Ta!
What...must you wear that ghastly handbrace?
l must find someway to attend
to these women properly.
l believe the French might have
quite a bit of luck using that tones.
Please be serious.
We're speaking of my patients.
They need me.
Perhap for the first time, l feel...
truely useful.
Aren't you a rainy day?
Oh, don't worry, something will come along, simply...
- Oww!!
l wish l could share your optimism.
Oh...Excuse me.
Just...just...
Dr. Granville.
- Oh...
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l think so.
Thank you.
Oh, you quite finish, Doctor?
Edmund, this is Emily's sister Charlotte.
Charlotte Dalrymple,
Edmund St. John Smythe.
Oh, Edmund Smythe from the papers.
Overblown...l assure you
l attend that party, l need a favor to a dear friend
and l can swear l never met that whores before mylife.
Sounds as of you had a jolly good time.
What brought you to the west-end, Miss Dalrymple?
Begging for money, unsuccessfully till now.
Ah, yes. Miss Dalrymple runs a settlement house in the east end .
How fascinating.
l must be going.
Oh, that seems as your hand are no better.
lt must be difficult pleasuring
half the women in the city.
Madam, pleasure has nothing to do with it.
l can assure you
Well l suppose that depends wether
your rave at the table or on it.
Goodbye.
You know how much we admire your spirit, Charlotte.
And we're lifelong friends of your father.
But these element you work with
are nothing more than
the draught horses of society.
l don't see how charity will help...
lt's not charity. Perhaps a loan.
A loan? How much?
Two hundred pounds.
Generally, a loan has some security, dear.
They were my mother's.
They should cover the balance and more.
We will give you two hundred pounds at eight percent interests.
- Thank you.
Now l want you to be sure you
understand this is strictly business, Charlotte.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes
We won't hesitate to collect...
l understand.
Thank you.
Mr. Huddleston.
Thank you. Thank you for your time and your generou...
Mrs. Huddleston, thank you.
lt means a great deal to soo many people.
Thank you, thank you.
Scandalous...
Hello?
Dr. Granville...
Troubling for patients?
Perhap you finding cases of hysteria here.
Women are all too busy trying to find enough to eat.
Miss Dalrymple. Always speaking out of turn.
No. l come to enquire about
Miss Fanny broken ankle.
A house call?
Surely, there's no harm following up with the patient?
None at all.
No pain?
No. Nothing.
l've going to take her to see you on Friday.
There's no bother.
l was in the neighborhood.
l was...l was near the neighborhood.
- How's that feel?
- Fine, thank you Doctor.
Would you like a cup of tea, Doctor?
Oh, no, thank you.
Dr. Granville. lt's the least we can offer.
Yes. Alright then.
Cup of tea would be lovely.
Take it easy on that for a few days.
- Yes, Doctor.
Very good. Now wait for me in a moment.
You can wait just through there.
Hello...
Hang on.
Just getting to the good bit.
Thank you. l wouldn't be able to sleep
without knowing how that turn out.
Milk, Doctor?
- Please.
We use this room mostly as a nursery.
l do fit in a little bit of teaching now and then.
Promoting some agresive political agenda, no doubt.
Sums and letters mostly.
Occasionally we sneak in something slightly progressive.
Oh...you might like this.
Actually look. For example...
this is where the children wash their hand.
We use soap
and boiled water. We do our best
to keep the settlement sanitary, but...
you can't imagine the filth and the germs.
You know about germs?
l do read, Doctor.
l spend years trying to convinced the medical
establishment that the hand washing prevent disease
and unsuccessfully.
and then here you are teaching it to the children.
And with great success.
l know. With the parent is another story.
But, eventually the children will teach them themselves.
Bravo.
For the women, we trying to provide
services that will offer the most direct result.
Good hot meal,safe place for
their children and communal laundry.
l think we can ease their work load a bit.
We could get on to the important
work, of changing their minds.
You Madam, are a socialist.
A socialist?
What if l am?
Socialism, it is hard.
lt's nothing more than a group pulling together.
lf women pull together,
if they weren't so frighten.
There's no telling what we could accomplished.
ln this revolution that you're planning,
will you achieved it all from here?
Drop a stain in a pond, then it will main ripple.
lt's a bit like pond. lt is true. l know this.
- Yes.
The building adjacent,
and the one behind,
are both for sale for two thousand pounds.
Bought them together,
and we're not just a classroom and a kitchen
we're centre for the neighborhood with a garden,
a proper school,
maybe even a medical clinic.
And two thousand pounds,
it's aiming quite high, don't you think?
No, I don't think so.
l know, by the time l'm gone,
women will have to vote
they have equal education
and rights over their own bodies.
and l like to play some small
part in making that happen.
Absolutely. And then,
you should teach them how to fly.
l would.
You just wait and see, Doctor.
l like to see your face.
Your passion, your devotion to this work is admirable.
Honestly,
l kept much more out of it than they do.
They only get food and laundy
and l'm giving a useful life.
And l set my own hours.
You know...
l could really use the help of
enable Doctor on a more regular basis.
bread and apple for the least of it
All children suffer from malnutrition, rigid scurvy,
even cholera and typhus.
All preventable as you know
with the knowledge and sources.
l'm afraid my patients keep me very busy.
l only mean...
l only mean in weeked in month.
l don't believe l would have the time.
Or even a few hours on Sunday. Anything would help.
I'm sorry.
Please. Please.
- Miss Dalrymple.
l'm afraid l can't help.
You can't...
or you won't?
lt's a bit more complex than that.
l know, l know. lt's...
lt's my father.
He wouldn't allow it, would he?
ls that why you came here?
To keep me from bringing Fannie
back to his posh little practice?
Thank you for the tea.
Run along Doctor. Back to your...
silly comfortable life.
Mrs. Castellari, Doctor.
Send her in, Nurse.
- Mrs. Castellari.
Mrs. Castellari, how are you?
Sad, Doctore.
Very sad today.
Good, good.
Lie back, please.
Aii!!!
Your hand is so cold, Doctore.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Castellari.
I forgot.
Yes.
ls  that better?
I think that's enough for today, Doctore.
Feeling better, than?
Mrs. Castellari!
Mrs. Castellari!
I assure you Mrs. Castellari,
this is never happened to me before.
You have dicredited my entire practice.
l'm very sorry.
Sorry will hardly suffice.
Your disability is clearly far more serious
than you let me to believe.
Ms. Castellari tells me you fail
to complete the treatment.
And now,
l discovered that Mrs. Parsons has stopped coming altogether.
lf you could only see or wait while giving
me one more chance, l can assure you...
No.
l thought you are someone l could trust,
with my business, my family,
my reputation.
But, clearly l was mistaken.
You're dissmiss.
Doctor.
- Dissmiss!
l'm terribly sorry.
l'm finished, Edmund.
Completely buggered.
l had a perfect life within reach and, l lost it.
All due to hand cramps.
[phone ring]
God!
Someone's telephoned.
Ahoy!
I didn't know you had a telephone.
l'm very, very flattered. Yeah.
Oh, yes, indeed.
My God!
Now l'm inventing a cleaning tool.
Yeah, very good.
Yes.
Yeah, do that...
Got to rush, actually now.
Goodbye.
Oh...Don't stop.
l think you enjoying yourself too much.
lt makes your hand feel all...all warm and tingling.
l feel it right down to the bone.
Oh, really?
Turn it back on.
Please...
Well, thats what l call good steady pressure.
lt go any higher?
Go on.
That's it. That's the spot.
My feathers!
This is the spot, indeed.
Bugger...
You smell burning?
But you said yourself that you
could feel the vibration deep inside...
l know what l said.
But this is crude and rough and inexact
and nothing at all like
the motion and pressure that l use.
Didn't seem to have much this time.
l grant you.
lf this works,
it could put you back in good standing with Dr. Dalrymple and Emily.
Edmund, let me be perfectly clear about this.
We are not going to take
a dangerous explosive and untried electrical device
and press it against the ladies most gentle areas.
That's it, then.
l believe l shall regret this
to the very end of my days.
Now, who should we try it on?
Ordinarily for five pounds, l
wouldn't ask questions.
That's with the man. This is a different kettle of fish.
Don't believe it will involve any pain.
But if it does,
we will stop immediately.
Think of it this way, Molly.
for one brief moment, you could be a
pioneer of technology.
The voyage of the British Empire,
and quite possibly,
vanguard of modern medical science.
And we pay up front.
Why not?
Do your worse.
Ooh...
- Are you hurt?
No.
No. lt just scared me for that. That's all.
I've never felt one like that before.
Shall l stop?
No, no. We try again.
l'll be ready this time.
Oh, right there.
Yes, like that.
How do you feel, Molly?
Bloody marvellous, like you think.
Would you say you had a paraxism?
l say three time can them, boy.
lt got a little muddled in the middle.
lt's astonishing.
What you call that little thing?
Well, l was calling it a feather duster.
Well, let's think of something quick.
So the girls know what to ask for.
Whore's feathers?
l give you my word as a gentleman, sir.
Three paroxysms in five minutes.
No harm came to the girl?
She was completely satisfied with the result.
Yes. Well, l can hardly take the word of a collop.
That's why we must try it here.
Medical science demands a thorough investigation.
What better place to start than with these women
whom we know suffer soo from hysteria?
Yes. Well, in my oppinion, change is rarely beneficial.
l believe we're on the verge
of something revolutionary, sir.
lf we achieve half as much of your patient,
all credit goes to you.
Not just money, fame.
Three paroxysms in five minutes, you say?
Very well .
One test case.
But if she comes to harm, on your head be it.
The rubby-nubby.
The vibratorium.
Jigly-wigly?
paroxysmator.
Oh, the sorcerer's apprentice.
- Excitetator?
- Mr. Wobleck.
What about, the squealer?
You gonna need a bigger appointment book.
Electric massage?
l don't know.
l have full confident that the
machine will equal if not better,
any treatment you've had before.
And, since you're so unsatisfied last time,
l'm prepared to offer you this, gratis.
l'll trust you, Doctore.
This is Mr. Edmund St...
That is my electrical assistant.
He'll be attending as well, if that's alright?
lt's a little surprise at first, Mrs. Castellari.
But don't be alarm,
you'll soon get use to it.
Everything all right, Mrs. Castellari?
Bravo!
Well done.
So, dont forget to chain the gate,
And, oh...l left the candle lit in the kitchen.
Go, and have a lovely evening.
You know, l think l will.
Bye.
Dr. Mortimer Granville.
Oh, l'm sorry. We're closing.
- Get her out of there.
Two hundred pounds plus interest,
or we lock the gate.
But l don't have it.
Right. l'm locking the gate.
Get of me!
No doubt, you're the luckiest man all of London.
- Miss Dalrymple.
Miss Charlotte Dalrymple.
Will you excuse me, ladies?
Miss Dalrymple.
Dr. Granville, good evening.
Congratulations.
l'm sure you'll make my sister very happy.
Something wrong?
No, no.
l just never seen you so...
Formally attired?
l was going to say...
clean.
Dr. Granville, l can assure you
that women enjoy physical pleasure just
as much as men,
even if it can be harsh to come by.
- Physical pleasure has nothing to do with it.
lt is strictly a medical treatment stimulate the nervous system.
lndeed it does, doesn't it.
Let's bargain it to guinea.
But my point is,
according to your diagnosis,
hysteria seems to cover everything,
from insomnia to toothache.
lt's not my...
- lt's nothing more than a catch-all
for dissatisfied women.
women, forced to spend
their life on domestic chores
and they're prudish and
selfish husband too are unwilling
or unable to make love to them properly, or often enough.
You seem to have strong oppinion
on husbands for woman who doesn't have one.
Look, if you don't believe me,
ask your patients.
Faintly ironic, don't you think.
Use my engagement party
as oppurtunity to deliver your oppinion matter?
- Yes, yes.
and l apologize for that, but you must admit,
you men really did get the best side of the bargain.
Bargain?
For l said, lt's mindless housework and dating some halfwit
you can make some halfwit very happy.
lt simply not enough for me, or for most women.
Would it be enough for you?
l'm not most women.
Wouldn't you be lonely?
l will take a partner.
An equal.
But, not for me a life of donning socks, doing chores
until my mental faculties become Sunday pudding.
ls someone says Sunday pudding?
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe may l present
Miss Dalrymple.
Miss Dalrymple, my guardians.
Lord and Lady St. John Smythe.
Charlotte  "Sunday pudding" Dalrymple.
So please to meet you, my dear.
l love a good Sunday pudding.
Cannot be happier for you, Mortimer.
You make us proud, each and everyday.
Thank you.
Lovely earrings.
Oh, thank you. They were my mother's.
Will your mother be joining us this evening?
No, my mother is infact dead,
my Lord.
l trust we didn't waste an invitation on her.
What about your father?
Will he be here or is he dead as well?
No. My father is quite well. Thank you.
l've not seeing him but l'm sure he'll be here soon.
Oh, hurry up. Damn you.
Give a move on!
They will keep your love of your life waiting, my dear.
A toast to the happy couple.
You'll soon find that the key to a happy marriage
is the ability to enjoy a good argument.
- Yes.
Do remember to let him win once in a while, my dear.
Oh...Oh...no, no.
There's a misunderstanding.
l rather marry Edmund than Dr. Granville.
Marry Edmund?
Sure, she's a live one.
Who is this man?
That's my father.
l thought he was dead.
May l present, Dr. Robert Dalrymple.
My Lord.
And this is my fiancee, Emily Dalrymple.
Fiacee? That l thought...
Never mind, dear.
How very nice to meet you, Doctor.
- My Lady
Miss Dalrymple.
l do appologize for being so late.
That's quite alright.
Your hair is the most adventerous, Emily.
Oh, do you think so?
We took it so long to get it up there.
Shall we do the once around.
Well, yes.
- Excuse us.
Port, Doctor?
Delightful.
Tell me how you met our young
Mortimer?
Lovely party.
Yes...yes, it is.
What are your interest?
Music, l enjoy reading.
Phrenology.
Mortimer stay modest.
Tell us how widen your accomplished, you are.
Phrenology is a treasure map to
the personality if one is properly trained.
We are licensed in this machine
to doctors all over London.
For a very generous royalty, of course.
l despise business.
So do l.
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Huddleston. Come, let me introduce you.
Good evening, Mr. Huddleston.
Mrs. Huddleston, do you know Dr. Granville?
Not personally.
Very nice to meet you.
- Charmed.
Looks though.
You going to be getting these earring after all.
You'll have to excuse us.
l'm sorry.
That was a little odd.
These earring are the security against the loan
for the settlement house for this due tomorrow.
So this is my last night with them.
They were your mother's.
Yes, they were.
You do what you must.
l'm sure she would've approved.
Bugger.
Througout history,
great English families
have gathered in halls such as this,
to celebrate the impending nuptial...
Lord, save us.
Tell me. What happened?
They came for the money,
I told them that l didn't have it...
Mr. Huddleston, what's the meaning of this?
you gave us until Monday.
l no longer hold the note, Charlotte.
Your father does.
Father?
Charlotte, calm down.
l'm simply do what's best for you.
What are you doing?
l purchased the note from Mr. Huddleston,
and l'm closing down the settlement house.
You no longer have any debt...
These are the actions of a villain.
Charlotte.
- Of a villain
This is your sister's engagement party.
Party? She's bruised and bleeding.
You want me to consider a party?
Make way, please.
Leave her.
- This is a private party.
You not man hand her.
Let me handle this.
We've got this under control.
l'm a doctor. l believe
this woman needs medical attention.
l don't know that, sir, but l do know she's not staying.
l haven't done anything wrong.
Please stop. She's hurt.
Just please, Charlotte.
lf we can discuss this like civilized men.
Let me by.
l said let me by.
Damn.
l miss something.
l would never have imagine it will come to this.
But we'll have to help her.
There's nothing 'but', Emily.
l tried indulging her, l tried firm hand
l've met my worse end.
Mortimer.
Please, she's my sister.
What would you have me do?
You must testify on her behalf.
- And say what?
- The truth.
That she's hysterical.
Sir, they will send her to a sanatorium.
That's the only thing that will keep her out of prison.
Order!
Order!
The court will come to order.
The facts are these, Your Honour.
One fortnight ago,
the defendant, Charlotte Dalrymple,
in fullview of witnesses,
assaulted a policeman Constable caring out his duty.
If this were a first offense,
the, a short prison sentence might suffice, but...
this isn't the first offence, is it Miss Dalrymple?
You're arrested last April
on public nuisance
and resisting arrest.
Your honour, l was handing out
suffragette leaflets in Trafalgar Square
when two officers arrested me.
The officers sworn statements read:
"Miss Dalrymple was asked
to leave the square,
where upon she started
to shout and jump about".
"When finally we did try to placed her in handcuffs,
she resisted
most violently".
No. That is not true.
You will speak only when question, Miss Dalrymple.
Well, how am l to defend myself against
his accusation if you won't let me speak?
ls there more?
l'm afraid there is, Your Honour.
October 1879, solicitation.
No, that was not me.
My friend, Molly...
she is a prostitute. She was a prostitute.
She has since found gainfull employment,
as a maid, in my father's house.
Anything else, Mr. Squyers?
No, Your honour.
No? Nothing else?
Whats of the crime
of charity and compassion?
Very admirable l'm sure.
Seems that the help included prostitution,
resisting arrest and
assaulting police officers.
One could only imagine that the cost to England,
should be sending university education to all her women .
Yes, it's very easy, isn't it?
to make fun of women's lives.
I would like to see you,
walk for one mile in our shoes,
l imagine that your mirth would turn, first
to sympathy and then to despair.
Be careful, Miss Dalrymple.
Your symptoms are showing.
Until England fully recognizes
the worth and contributions of women,
will she'll be anything other than second class country
despite all her wealth.
That's enough, Miss Dalrymple.
Your Honour,
Charlotte Dalrymple get herself from
erotic, agresive and violent emotions.
That our best describe, as incurable hysteria.
To back truce my oppinion, l would like to call
an expert witness, Your Honour.
Proceed, Mr. Squyers.
l would like to call Dr. Mortimer Granville,
lf it pleased the court.
Mortimer Granville, please.
Dr. Mortimer Granville.
Your Honour.
The evidence you shall give shall be the truth,
the whole truth nothing but
the truth so help you God!
lt will.
State your name.
Mortimer Granville.
Now, l'm sure we all, well aware
of your celebrity, Doctor.
But, lf you wouldn't mind just telling us
a little of your professional experience.
l'm a medical doctor whose practice consist
of treating women diagnose with hysteria.
And in this capacity,
how many women have you treated?
Hundreds, certainly.
And always good result, l trust?
we've had few complaints of late.
ls it true Dr. Granville that,
incurable cases of hysteria
demand institutionalization and surgical hysterectomy?
Please answer the question, Dr. Granville.
Well, yes.
Traditionally, yes.
But only in the most severe,
most persistance cases...
Thank you, doctor.
We have already address the...
the persistance of Miss Dalrymple problem.
ln your proffessional opinion, Doctor,
as an expert in the field of hysteria,
how would you describe Miss Dalrymple behaviour.
Without the doubt,
Charlotte Dalrymple is...
erotic,
and volatile,
and at time physically aggresive.
She is also the most vexing women l've ever met.
Thank you, doctor.
Your Honour, base on this evidence,
l find that, l must recommend
that Charlotte Dalrymple be remanded to the
chumps for the institute for the criminally insane.
With a further recommendations
for immediate surgical hysterectomy.
l wasn't quite finish.
Miss Dalrymple
is also the most generous, compassionate,
selfless and truely Christian
women that l have ever met.
Doctor, you just sworn that she is erotic,
volatile,
and even physically agressive.
Would you not characterize that as hysterical?
Well, you see...
after consulting with my patients
and considerable reflection,
lt is my proffessional oppinion
that hysteria is a fiction.
lt's nothing but a...
a tactual diagnosis for women without opprtunity
force to spend their life tending to do domestic chores
and selfish, prudish husband who are
unwilling or unable
to make love to them properly.
Or often enough.
l beg your pardon, Doctor...
Your Honour,
the Constable suffered no grave injury.
but great harm must still be done if
Miss Dalrymple is locked away and butchered
England will lose devoted and singular women
she can ill afford to spare.
I grant you, there may not room in the world
for more than one
Charlotte Dalrymple.
Fortunately for all of us,
l think they must've broken the mold.
ln the case of Charlotte Dalrymple,
there are no easy answers.
Mr. Squyers,
l find your case for hysteria
wanting.
By your reasoning,
we should lock up every female in
a whimsy and logic colide to which
suggested me most of women in England.
My wife included.
On behalf that matter, however 
l am loath to offer press it in where
policemen safety is being served.
Miss Dalrymple,
for striking a police officer in a course of his duty,
l sentenced you to
thirty days in prison.
and l want is you
to think most carefully and act most cautiously in the future.
Take her.
Miss Dalrymple.
Dr. Granville.
suppose l know that you might interest.
That's an interesting offer,
something to meditate on while l consider a new career.
Mortimer Granville, rou're a good doctor, and you should remain one
lnstead of leaching and bleeding
people in cutting them up to no purpose
you, have invented a machine that does harm to no one
and makes anyone had comes into contact with to fell better.
l should think there a very few doctors in history
that could let glimpse of such accomplishment.
You are a confounding women.
You're a fiery brimstone in one minute,
compliment and common sense the next.
I am a woman like any other.
No, no. You're quite unlike any women l've ever met.
Will you be alright?
l'm fine. l've a lot of friends in prison.
Mortimer
Thought l might find you here.
l've been thinking a lot about my future.
And...well, actually
l was wondering if you might give me a reading.
l'm sorry. l've giving up phrenology.
Oh, Emily, l'm...
l'm so sorry.
Don't be.
Charlotte's trial was a revelation for me as well.
l realised. l haven't been living my life at all.
l've been living my father's idea what my life should be
Phrenology, Chopin.
Even you, Mortimer.
You seem happy.
l am.
After all, life will always
be to large extent to what we ourself make it.
The inimitable Mr. Smiles.
l shall miss him.
And l shall miss you.
God, you're notty.
l should never send yourself of it .
No, no. Not even for Christmas.
You just go out and purchase one for yourself.
God bless you, Mom.
lt is a clever old woman
who can keep up with todays technology.
Alright then.
Lovely chatting to you.
Ring me anytime.
Goodbye.
Any prospects?
Open this.
l told you before l don't want your money.
lt's not my money, it's yours.
lt's your share of the royalty
of my manufacturers.
The portable electric massager.
The portable electric massager?
Yes, l told you l was working on something rather exciting .
You see, l made a very small motor.
lt seem to go really well, so l shared to few firms, 
and they simply adored it.
And apparently,
they selling it directly to women for home use.
l really have to admit, l know for it go so high
but, it is rather ingenius that l signifies saying it
myself. 
Don't you understand, Mortimer.
You have your fortune now.
You can have anything you want.
Miss Dalrymple.
Dr. Granville.
Hello.
Merry Christmas.
I realise it's a day early but l thought you might need it.
I don't know what to say.
Apparently, there is a first time for everything.
Right.
May I?
That's lovely.
Oh, that's very kind.
Oh, there's something more.
Think of it as a getting out of prison present.
You one said that with two thousand pounds,
you can change the world. 
You're not serious?
Apparently, l'm rich.
And the buildings are yet for sale.
Well, l'm not too late, am l? You're still interested?
Yes, of course.
More than ever.
Although l should think by the time l finished,
few thousand pounds not be nearly enough...
Are you never satisfied, woman?
might be enough for a clinic.
Clinic?
Would it pay well?
l'm afraid not.
Would the cases be interesting?
Routine, l should think.
Broken bones,
sick children,
needy women.
Sounds revolting.
Perhap something else.
Perhap something there.
l wondered if you might have an opening
for a partner, for an equal?
Mortimer, if you think...
Oh damn it!
Charlotte Dalrymple,
l love you.
Would you marry me?
Please don't make me beg. Not in a street.
You can't let me kiss you first.
Charlotte, l hardly think that in this circumstance...
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was rather nice actually.
You so?
Not bad.
You'll get better.
Who would've thought?
Charlotte and Mortimer, together.
Life often brings together strange bedfellows.
Yes, quite...quite.
Well, all's well that ends well.
Fresh air and perambulation.
The key to mental equity and long life.
lf you say so, Doctor.
Oh, look. Ducks.
You alright down there, Colonel?
Patience, Eugenia. Patience.
The empire was not built in a day.
That's very casual of you.
What are you wearing?
