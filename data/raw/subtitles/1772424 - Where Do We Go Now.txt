The story I will tell
I offer it to anyone who will listen
Story of people who fast,
people who pray
From an isolated hamlet,
surrounded by mines
Only between heaven and earth
Lost between two wars
Two clans wounded heart
Obscured the sun
The blood-stained hands
On behalf of a cross or a crescent
From an isolated hamlet
who chose peace
And embroidered its story
on barbed wire
It's a long story
women in black
Neither bright stars,
nor flaming flowers
Up eyes to ash
Whose fate would
Courage to do their virtue,
This is even higher, Roukoz?
Have mercy! It is punctured.
Nassim!
Roukoz!
It is not possible.
He said 200 meters!
It is not possible.
Say something!
Calm down, Mr. Mayor,
calm down.
There are mines there.
Caution!
Roukoz.
Downstairs, in Amal, it picks up.
Wait,
you really want to watch TV?
At Amal, the signal is weak.
You've studied the project?
That's the question.
This is a State project, my friend.
Fuck you, Roukoz!
Fuck you!
I'm told you so!
Calm down, son.
Gently!
I should have stayed home.
Cursed be the village of shit!
Here.
Poor Bridget!
Nassim, come help your brother.
How are you, Issam?
That's okay, Mom.
This is Bridget?
Yes, that's it.
- One who has not known love.
- It was she who jumped at the mine?
This is the sixth.
The sixth!
It's not fair.
You're right.
It's a real loss.
Courage!
This is Bridget.
You've never seen such a pile?
You've never seen a hair so beautiful?
Enter for a coffee.
In return, perhaps.
For peace of his soul!
We drink at the wedding
of your children, I hope.
Gently, please.
Well see you lying!
Lady!
Calm down, Yvonne.
And television of Afaf, it not work?
No.
There is no other TV
in the village?
No.
But there is no sound.
Do not worry about it.
Let's fix that.
This whole idea is crazy!
Lord God.
Holy Mary!
Umm Khalil is not doing well.
If she dies,
where will the people?
There are no other chairs.
Listen, my son.
I entrust them to you.
They are brand new.
You are responsible.
Behave.
Stops, Hamoudi.
Mrs. Amal.
They are very fresh.
You do not have enough of it,
This cap rotten?
I already do not stand it
on your father!
Amal.
Come and sit here.
Let her.
Here it is.
You're dying it comes.
Bon appetit.
That's all I can say.
Hello, heroes!
No change
especially no cap, you!
Give it back to him.
Welcome to you all,
on this historic day
that saw our village.
We are grateful for their presence,
our priest and our sheikh,
symbols of our unity
and our coexistence.
Our apologies
for this long and painful road.
But as you know,
we did not find a good signal here.
Dear people of my village,
I rejoice,
I would say that I exult,
to be with you,
under the starry dome,
in that glorious day
where, as a united flock,
we are about
to pass through the portal
between the twentieth century
the twenty-first century.
About flock
We thank Abu Ali.
We say:
Brigitte did not die for nothing.
She has sacrificed his soul for us.
She sacrificed her body.
Any one of us
- Could have been in his place.
- Where it's on fire?
I remind you
that only the right goat
Halal is slaughtered.
God bless you, Abu Ali.
Just as we defeated
the conflict
that separated us
and shed blood among brothers,
we will soon, I hope,
our bridge repair,
to come and go,
like everyone else.
Special thanks to
Yvonne, my wife ...
who offered us,
so generously,
this TV.
Good evening,
Exceptional warmth
and very high temperatures
rule over the area,
It's the first heatwave
years,
The thermometer reached 41 degrees,
Therefore, avoid exposing yourself
the burning sun,
Protect yourself well
and ... attention to heat stroke!
Nassim,
I told you nude.
Yvonne, I asked
stockings for varicose veins, that's all.
It is not sticky to you.
It is that of Amal.
This is not your size.
Let me see.
No, it's not bad.
I keep it.
Rita, my order is ready?
This is a mess at home.
- They are starving.
- Yes, it's ready.
Why do you rush like that?
You can not stand in line,
like us?
Yes, each in turn.
- It's going!
- No, it will not.
Calm down.
Who told you sounded, you?
Hold your sticky and soothing tone.
Take each tablet,
it will soothe your nerves.
So, what about my lamps?
I sold them. At 25,000.
25,000?
Antiques!
More is older, it's expensive!
He squinted, who bought them.
Antique pieces!
Inherited from the Phoenicians!
Nassim, I requested the number 24,
not 17!
You abuse, really!
Fortunately someone
venture out and go shopping!
And that will see the color
your hair under the veil?
You look for me or what?
And you then!
Shut up at the end!
What is happening here?
Have you brought the papers?
I asked for three.
I have no place.
I have a small bike.
It's bad.
And my yard?
Do not tell me you're in a hurry.
Longer it lasts, the better for you!
You will see longer Ms. Amal.
Enough!
You disappear already?
- Stay a little!
- I'm busy.
And the site?
But finally stop.
Are you okay, Rabih?
Hello, Amal.
How is my beautiful?
That is not mine
as I am not in it
I see you perched in the heights
Oh if I could get
make you get off
How are you my beautiful?
You 're not for me,
as I am not yours
Hush, my heart, hush
Your heartbeat we parasitize
Calm your emotion,
your frantic beats
Could reveal the affair
Keep it well hidden
Seen or known
Little bird, can you tell me
That the ball will predict
Tell me if he thinks of me
And does not forget the invoice
Little bird,
Give me a tape
Tell me how far this story
If there is a hope that it lasts
And keep me informed
Already pinball, so early!
Do I deserve this?
What are you doing?
Okay, Amal?
And you, brother?
Sorry
but they make me mad!
The trash bag is in front
the door for three days!
I have not seen.
You did not see?
But what are you thinking?
Go, says my slipper.
Assaad, advance.
That's right, laughs. You rigoleras least
when I will send you your mother.
Jam, you do not sell it
less than ten thousand pounds.
I damaged hands
to prepare.
Take that. Buy yourself
two shirts and pants,
First Communion Sara
and throw me this jacket rotten.
May the Virgin protect you.
God bless you.
Rabih, when you count the end,
this site?
Amal when he smiles.
Shut up.
What do you do it?
She put a veil,
and be done!
You want to kill our people?
He baptizes him, instead!
We gain a Christian.
Really!
You think you higher?
Us is different.
We are baptized.
- Sorry!
- Yes.
Look Sassine.
He does not know
whether Christian or Muslim.
It is quiet.
Exactly.
Look, he has no worries.
A small altercation
Wardeh has degenerated to
in religious clash
between Christians and Muslims,
in which arms
were used by both sides,
It deplores four injured
and property damage ...
- Slowly.
- Highest. Pluck it out!
What is this?
Change me this chain.
There are children watching.
- But it's a beautiful film.
- No, no question.
Leave.
A channel.
There are children.
Sassine, change the channel.
There are children.
Should not they see it.
Let the information.
We do not want it!
Come back.
Forget, we're not here for!
If, on the contrary.
Increases the sound.
The Council of Ministers met
urgently to consider
the situation in the country,
both judicial
at the level of the main
security issues,
Furthermore, and on
the latest events
Wardeh neighborhood,
An unnamed source said ...
You still have the finger in the nose!
Not at all!
Did you even put your red sweater?
Between Christians and Muslims ... ...
Let me point out that your hens
no longer leave my garden!
Let us listen!
And you, shut up!
What are you doing,
good morning?
Calm down!
Religious authorities regret ...
You got the nerve
to give us lessons!
Mrs Prout Prout-!
It is you who smell bad!
And now Ms. Sainte Nitouche!
Yep, my dear!
It is you, the chicken!
Fatmeh! What did she do to you?
Gunfire can still be heard ...
Amal What is this bright idea?
Wolves will hunt us down.
- Shut up.
- Advance!
Are you sure that you recognize the way?
Hurry, the wolves are coming!
I know the way.
Hurry.
Are you afraid of the big bad wolf?
Are you afraid for your fat ass?
Hurry, we freeze them.
I want to my ass.
Which do you think?
I am not qualified Sabotage Es-TV.
It shatters the screen and basta.
It's Yvonne who will slam.
Sweet virgin.
I'll piss in my pants.
- It is the dead?
- Stop!
Trying to focus!
We'll end with dessert for wolves
and yet you hesitate!
Let me do it!
Is something wrong with the scooter?
- A flat tire.
- That's it!
The concern,
this is my single lot?
You come home at dawn?
And you, cousin!
I was counting on you.
Shut up! Go inside!
A flat tire?
They are indestructible,
those tires!
I do not know
where they drag these scoundrels!
A simple altercation in Wardeh
degenerate into sectarian conflict
So it is true,
what we heard.
Has anyone seen these papers?
No.
This is a disaster.
I know what to do.
They read my ass now!
Say, Saydeh ...
Your ass,
it is plaid?
My ass is a dictionary.
Looking for a word?
I swear on my head ...
It's me
who have left the window open.
The wind brought down the cross
which is broken.
It makes it a drama?
Unless it takes a storm
to bring down the cross.
I repeated it a hundred times:
The church is dilapidated.
Its foundations are rotten.
Someone has moved?
You, Youssef.
How many times I have asked you?
Once it was a hernia,
another, gall ...
Now that the cross was broken,
Energy is yours.
You play hard!
You say it is the other
that have broken.
They create problems
in the village.
Do not let
events that happen
outside the village influence you.
These are just rumors.
Everything is for the best
in the brave new world.
There is absolutely nothing.
What is happening?
May God Almighty forgive us!
The son of a bitch!
The only place
that you have not soiled!
You provoke us?
You nag?
You speak to us?
The house of God!
Abu Ahmad!
Son of a bitch!
- You speak to me?
- The house of God!
Do not do that, Abu Ahmad!
The house of God, bastards!
God forgive us!
Go, go home.
Do not react
to what happens elsewhere.
Moreover, it is elsewhere.
It's been years that we live in good
agreement with our Christian brothers.
And livestock in the mosque?
Who told you that it's them?
Who then?
I do not know more than you.
The mosque remains open.
A goat entered.
She wanted to see the carpet.
Holy Mary!
Sweet Jesus!
What happened to you?
The font is full of blood!
Full of blood!
Kind of thug!
Come here!
I do not want to see you here!
I'll break your legs!
Cursed be your father!
It's a boy!
I will break, your legs.
Boutros, calm down.
Stops, it's a child!
I'll kill you.
Savages!
Look!
Leave him!
And it is believed the men!
Are you a man, you?
You're picking on a kid?
What a shame.
Come, my boy.
I had you banned
playing in front of the church.
Fatmeh ... Answer me.
I beg you.
Do not tell Abu Ahmad.
Do not worry,
I'm not crazy.
Will take care of your son!
Let me go.
Do not tell your father.
You're a brave boy.
So what?
It is blood.
It is a sign?
God is trying to talk to us.
Yes, he tries
to tell us that you're idiot.
It is the blood of a chicken.
It's a chicken pen.
All that work for nothing.
Nobody has touched.
Good for us.
Eat, lets off steam yourself.
Crunch!
The appetite is healthy.
It would take a miracle to calm them.
Yvonne.
You hear us?
Speak to us.
Blessed be thy name.
She talks with the Virgin!
Pity, O Virgin Mary!
What's going on?
Peace be upon her.
- Has she gone crazy?
- She speaks to the Virgin.
Wake up.
What she tells you,
the Virgin?
She is angry.
She weeps tears of blood.
She said that the cross of blood
which marked our foreheads ...
She said that the cross of blood
which marked our foreheads ...
Are a sign of God's wrath.
Anger!
The wrath of God descends on you!
- Do you hear?
- Yes.
Affect children
not you ashamed?
Sorry.
- The Virgin is angry.
- We're not there for nothing!
Come on, talk to the Virgin.
She calls you.
What did she say?
She sees men killing each other.
The village upside down.
Men crouching
taking  their weapons from attics ...
and other face down,
hiding under their beds.
What else?
Joseph!
She sees St. Joseph,
blessed be He.
Joseph Daoud!
What is he?
This is a big con.
The Virgin said that?
Shut up,
you'll get us in trouble.
You're going to mess it up.
He treated his neighbor,
Abu Hassan, big con.
And he launched blackberries
on linen 0um Hassan.
If it's true!
Stop, Yvonne.
Ahmad and Abu!
What is he?
He threw his trash in
his neighbor George's garden.
It's true, I saw you!
Come on, we're going.
I'll stick him in one!
Forget it.
She is crazy.
Go ahead and faints.
It's good. There, you fainted.
Close your eyes.
Quick, water and sugar!
Yvonne is a party!
I'll give him sugar.
What a farce.
We're the laughingstock of the village.
Push yourself.
Okay, Yvonne?
Your wife is a saint,
Mr. Mayor.
My wife, a saint?
My wife is a miracle!
Yvonne, just if we talk about.
Sorry to interrupt,
Madam Mary.
Go, get up.
Tomorrow you will see again the Virgin.
We had our dose of miracles.
Arise.
Stops. It will end
looking like Gargamel.
Give me that.
Shows.
She is beautiful, no matter what.
If only
you could enlighten us
and tell us what to do.
It only needed that!
Did you see the devil?
Do not skimp,
they must be beautiful.
Impossible, no way!
I beg you, Mrs. Impossible!
Are you afraid for your old crust?
You should pay double
for they watch it.
Come on over here the currency
truce and chat!
And you, Madame Mayor,
get out your pennies.
Shame on you
and this diabolical idea!
The sky may fall on my head,
I will never accept!
Are you afraid for the mayor? He's not 
touched it since the silent era,
it's only use 
is  as a garden hose!
Quickly lightens your wallet!
Such soldier's language!
It's a shame.
I do not agree.
Hey!
Come on, put the package.
That the wake, perhaps.
Abu Ahmad lets try something else.
Are you scared? Attaches it to him!
I'll kill you!
Amal, file your part.
This is Rabih that bothers you?
I know my brother.
Two days and it will pass.
This is ... Svetlana.
And now ...
Tatiana.
And there ... Anna now!
And this one is that?
Katia?
Let's see.
Yes, this is Katia.
Did you see that? It has been said
a sexy outfit, not naked.
And this one is that?
I do not see who it is.
We have chosen it?
Here, look.
This is the bonus.
It has spun for free.
But what it does?
You're more beautiful than she!
Stop the bullshit.
And if it was a Satanist?
That's okay,
It takes an army of demons
to calm them down!
What a jerk!
I said a failure,
not an explosion!
Ah, dancers.
And something to dance, you?
Lido?
I understand now,
these gazelle legs!
While we are
only good for the household.
My calf is three times its size!
But in your youth, my dear,
your hips
shook the mountains!
I weighed 7.5 kg at my birth.
Impressive.
Do you have something
to drink?
A drink?
We have bramble tea.
Keep your thorns for you.
Give them a drink!
You, you and you ...
Why come here?
The bus dropped us
at the village entrance.
We toured the regions.
Shows up everywhere.
You know the Bolshoi?
Of course!
And how!
I swear, these girls
are more famous than the Bolshoi!
Allow me, Mr. Mayor.
Grows. And you my dear,
yourself off the glass.
You see the little doll
cute, there?
A real monkey!
We see her standing
almost frozen ground.
Then all of a sudden, it jumps
and takes off!
She turns, it spins
and when she is tired,
it lands,
right as an "i".
I swear to you, Reverend.
You see the other side?
This,
when she does the splits,
I am not telling you!
It does this even on the walls.
And you know what happens to the wall?
It cracks.
I've seen things in my life.
But never anything like it!
How many women
have you known?
It is different.
Chance would have it.
All VIP countries
dream to watch,
with respect.
The greatest personalities
want to see them!
Let me pass.
- Please.
- Hello.
Push yourself.
So this is
makes you lose your head?
They seem to
emerging from a long famine.
Have you seen the anorexic, there?
And the other
flat as a flounder?
The lightest of our breasts
can feed half of Ukraine.
Listen to me.
You must be patient
for a few days
and accommodate these girls.
The poor,
they have nowhere to go.
It should accommodate them.
God will reward us.
Once the bus repaired,
will each in turn. Is it not?
That's nice.
Many thanks.
You are welcome.
Hamoudi, my darling,
approach.
I need you and Assaad.
You're a boy reasonable
I know.
You too, Assaad.
Come.
Do it just for me.
It bothers you
if they sleep
in your room?
Not at all.
They are welcome.
Great, then help them
to carry their luggage.
And you, turn the water heater
for their shower.
Where's the suitcase?
Stop grumbling, it's tiring.
Cursed be your parents!
Why it's only one?
One, that's fine.
Two, where do you want me to put them?
It's not fair.
Hamoudi and Assaad have two.
I have no place.
I have only one room!
Where are you going to put it?
On my head, in my heart.
In the apple of my eye!
I'll take care of it.
I have no time
to lose with this crippled.
You're too busy?
You have too rendezvous
with the Virgin?
Not talking about the Virgin!
Can she cut your tongue!
And may she, blessed be his name,
get rid of you,
that I may have peace.
Pronounces his name.
Come here, girl.
Give it.
It takes me back a cripple
and dares to speak of the Virgin.
Welcome, it is an honor.
You are there!
Hello neighbor! How are you?
Evil!
The old me on the floor installed.
And in the kitchen and more!
Can you put your dresses
in the fridge.
We, we have a five-star service.
Two valets, cigarettes.
Young man!
- Get up!
- My God!
This is war?
Not yet.
Arise.
Prayer is better than sleep.
No bread, no sugar ...
You never eat bread?
Really?
But no, look.
Look at these children!
Bravo!
God bless you.
What a sight, what energy!
No salt? At all?
A fork?
Nothing!
Or cakes or cakes?
She eats nothing!
- They are truly sated?
- I do not know.
They may say, the bread, hold it.
You get a name, in Ukraine.
Bravo, my boy.
When I ask you a glass of water,
you're not so brave!
There you frétilles like a fish.
We work
or we do not work, you rattle!
I fear for your back, idiot.
Shut up and be happy.
They are all occupied.
They no longer see it.
A single row, guys.
Hamoudi, in range!
At your command, General!
I would like a tonic
for the hair.
Noted.
I want a slimming cream.
Look, girls.
A cemetery!
Christians and Muslims ...
There are more deaths
than living here.
They are so young.
There are only pictures of men.
Looks like the son of Yvonne!
Really?
You saw the picture with her?
I understand better
why she is crazy ...
He's cute!
What a face of love!
What a mess ...
Poor mothers ...
Even dead, they are separated.
What happens to you?
Where are you going on pilgrimage?
- In your mother, asshole!
- Pardon?
What's the matter?
We stole our shoes
at the mosque.
- Did you say what?
- In your mother, all right?
- It's mine you speak?
- Yes, you.
- To me, you bastard?
- Yes!
You speak not of my mother, right?
Backwards!
Never talk about my mother!
Get out!
Never, you hear?
Stop!
Enough!
Stop!
Enough!
You have not learned anything?
Not understand?
Your mother has not suffered enough?
She has not stopped crying your brother.
Her tears
have not had time to dry.
Finally have some dignity!
We'll end up denying our faith!
Our unique destiny,
this is you crying?
Wear the black all our lives?
Have mercy! Pity!
You are nothing but thugs.
You will disgust us of God
and the village of shit!
That's be men, for you?
And you!
What did he say?
Why did you fired?
Hit me, I'm one of them.
I'm one of them, I tell you.
Hit me!
Unleashed on me!
Leave me out of here!
Go die in front of you!
Get put of here!
And you,
I want nothing from you.
That everyone is doing.
Get out.
I do not want to see anyone here!
Come here, you.
Ten hours in the sun!
You have never seen the sun?
That's going to look?
Who will still want you?
You are burned!
Poor us!
You have been brought from so far!
What they're up to?
The poor, they are hot.
They're going to die.
Oh if your binoculars had ears.
Gently, my daughter.
We'll lose them, Amal.
Do you think Rita is awakened?
It takes a sledgehammer to wake!
I know.
It has a heavy sleeper.
Dammit!
What are you doing,
you almost killed me!
Can we borrow your tape recorder?
Expect.
That,
here.
The K7 is inside.
- You know I use it?
- Yes, do not worry.
They have 2500 nuclear warheads
and can not do it?
I prefer to make sure.
Okay, Rabih?
Good evening, Amal.
What's the matter? Is it serious?
No.
- Are you alone?
- What's it look like?
Do not worry.
The poor had an allergy
cats to Amal.
It is all stained.
Salvation.
You want what, exactly?
Where do you want me to go
at this hour?
I have more room in my house.
But you have an empty room.
She could sleep with you.
Seriously,
you want me to take care of her?
This is not a disability!
It is she who will look after you.
Come on, darling. Between.
I will prepare him to his room.
We will not spend the night.
And then she eats little.
Katyusha?
As the rockets?
And if she farted in his face?
God preserve you!
Why do you think she farts?
How old is she?
How old, you?
Twenty-eight.
She looks younger.
She is married?
Ask him.
No, I'm too young.
She says
she's too young.
At his age, I had weaned two.
I do not have time.
I work a lot.
She said what?
She says she has not found
Prince Charming.
And that men
like you are rare.
He is strong, my brother.
She said that?
She is well educated.
Tell him
I hit the Christian girls.
And I'll throw his business
if it annoys me.
This is the moment, you think?
I'm ashamed.
He says you're welcome.
Thank you very much.
It is really nice.
And then she said what?
She says she apologizes,
she is very embarassed
and it does annoy you more.
She will accompany
for better and for worse.
It's touching,
as it is polished!
If that's it, ask him
what she eats in the morning?
Who cares. It burst!
Milk, two eggs and it will go.
No, ask him.
What you eat in the morning?
I do not eat in the morning.
I sleep late.
She says
she lives with love and fresh water.
She wants to get ready
breakfast.
What class!
If this is such nice hands, I agree.
But you know what ...
She looks proud
and made her proud.
For her,
I am not of his rank.
Find him rather a Christian.
You're right.
She tells you
you're just selfish.
Going to the hairdresser,
it looks like a plucked chicken!
What! She said that?
Already? What insolence!
Do not listen, darling.
It is perfect, my brother.
We can count
on foreigners.
We!
Go, good evening!
What fly has bitten?
If there were words between us
One would have spoken
If there were tears us
It would have cried
If there was a path that leads us
Together, they would have borrowed
If there was a path that we take
Together, we have found
If there was a dream of us
One would have fallen asleep
If there was peace between us
We have forgotten
If there was a path that leads us
Together, they would have borrowed
If there was a path that we take
Together, we have found
Is there a single chorus
us repeated
Are there too many people
interposed between us
Would there be a moon, a tree
Or even a broken bridge?
Is there a plain, a mountain
Or a forgotten valley?
Another way, perhaps,
we would not have found yet?
Hello, guys.
Good evening.
Excuse me.
Sit.
I will not bother.
Continue.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I was bored in my room.
Magic.
How are you?
You can get water?
Welcome.
Thank you very much.
Very hot here.
Very hot.
Ok guys, I must go.
It was nice to chat.
No, stay seated.
Do not bother to get up.
It was nice to meet you.
Good evening.
See you soon.
My friends, I am not alone.
Stop, you're exaggerating.
Do not make a drama!
We must abandon the weapons,
there was no choice.
You go without telling me?
With everything that's happening there?
Oh, I swear!
You will make me crazy.
Are you drunk?
Nassim?
Nassim, darling.
Darling.
Why not respond?
Nassim?
Nassim, my heart.
What is he?
What is this?
Answer me!
What happened to you,
my child?
Nassim!
Roukoz, what he has?
Answer, what is he?
Why not respond?
Answer me, darling!
Roukoz, speak!
Why the silence?
Speak!
It's all my fault!
It was the wrong way on the way.
There were people
who were shooting.
Christians and Muslims.
He was shot.
I knew what to do.
They killed him!
I beseech you, Holy Mary!
I'll tell Issam.
Where are you going? What are you doing?
Do not move!
He must know.
You know how it is.
It will kill a Muslim
and ignite the village.
I beg you.
He must know.
Leaves, I will tell him.
I did more than him.
I want to lose him.
Answer me, my boy.
Answer me, my heart.
Get down from there.
You're not a mother yourself?
You're not a mother?
You take other people's children
without asking?
By what right do you take me?
Why you did not protect?
What were you doing?
I put him under your wing
and this is how you pay me?
That's how you pay me?
Shall see,
it is downhole.
You, you do not care,
your son in your arms.
Me, my son, where he is?
Why you look at me like that?
Answer me!
It is where my son? Where is he?
Give it to me.
Give it to me!
Listen to me.
You do not ever see me again.
But I will not let you
you pick on other children.
Rita.
I do not want to see you cry.
Go wash the figure
Make-up yourself.
Put colorful clothes.
You, you are behaving normally.
If you were asked,
Nassim is sick.
He has mumps.
And should see someone.
Got it?
Give it back, if you like it.
This is an anti-flies, that thing!
- Give.
- Nothing will erase your smell of goat.
Because you smell the jasmine?
In any case, not the goat.
Give me that hat, you moron!
What are you doing?
This is the hat of Nassim.
Let him come himself to fetch!
Passes before me.
How could you do that?
Go, ahead!
What a shame!
What do you want exactly?
You think we do not
enough problems like that?
Takla.
Opens, it is Afaf.
How are you?
Hamoudi is present
apologized to Nassim
and give him his cap.
Go ahead, darling.
It's a joke that went wrong.
Nothing premeditated.
Apologies!
Go ahead and enter.
No, he can not enter.
Nassim is tired.
He come near him.
You do not seem to understand.
He has mumps.
It's contagious.
It's dangerous for boys.
We have enough problems!
It is a force of nature.
He risks nothing.
Why the mouth of burial?
Nassim?
- He sleeps, we will return.
- Come here. You apologize for here.
His throat is taken.
He can not speak.
I talk to the door?
Go ahead and talk. He hears you.
Yes, he hears you.
Tell him what you have to say.
Speak up!
I came to apologize.
Sorry
for what happened.
We are children of the same village.
We come from the same womb.
What happened is unfortunate.
You, and your cap Roukoz
are entitled to our respect.
Must not blame me.
I'll apologize.
It is the son of the same village.
Believe me,
it will not happen again.
Here, I kiss your door.
Your hat is in excellent condition,
always impeccable.
I put it there.
I wish you good healing.
Happy?
You do not look good.
You're very pale.
No, it's nothing.
A little tired.
Things will get better, thank God.
For Nassim, do not worry.
Mumps is nothing.
Two packs of marshmallow
and we do talk about that.
Wash your face and get dressed.
We go to Amal
to see how we will do.
"What next"?
What can be done?
Come, I count on you.
No, stay close to my son.
Bizarre.
Saydeh said Nassim
has already had mumps.
- Is it not?
- Indeed.
He had with my son,
in infancy.
Why are you lying?
Your stepmother was still alive.
You worry me for two days.
What are you hiding us?
Speak, what's the matter?
What do you have?
That's okay, Mom?
Hello Issam, you okay?
It is where, Aida?
Where is the green box?
I looked everywhere.
What Car? I know.
I searched the entire house.
- It is you who hid?
- No. And why the guns?
What for?
Why do you want weapons?
It is where, Nassim?
Why is it closed?
I've told you.
He has mumps.
Stop with the mumps!
Open!
Open that door!
Your brother has mumps.
Enough is enough. I want to enter!
I will not give you the key.
- Calm down, you're going to kill her.
- The Key!
- I beg you.
- Stop it, Mom.
Where is Naseem?
Nassim where it is? Look at me.
Where is Naseem?
Where is he?
He was hurt?
Aida, which is Nassim?
Why you say nothing?
Where is he?
What is he?
What is it made?
It is where, Nassim?
Speak!
Where is he?
What they did to her?
They have attacked him,
the son of a bitch?
- Who has hurt him?
- Nobody, I assure you.
Who attacked him?
Issam, I beg.
This is not the village people!
I beg you!
The son of a bitch!
Mother, what are you doing?
You have gone mad?
Do not go anywhere.
Drop it!
You will stay here.
Drop it!
This is not someone from the village.
- Drop it!
- You going anywhere!
You, I will not let you die.
What do you manufacture?
You can not stay!
You are crazy?
She flat one.
- Relax, like ...
- I want it!
- Why?
- Because!
It'll blow up here!
They are crazy.
They freaked out.
So what?
You think it's better than elsewhere?
We have a contract for the week.
They rely on us.
We will not move.
Okay, as you like.
But you will not have a dime!
Ooh, you make us very afraid!
We are terrified.
I smell a rat, my father.
We do not control more.
My dear Imam:
"Forgive them
for they know not what they do. "
Because we,
we know perhaps?
It was a death on our hands.
And death, it takes revenge.
Fortunately,
they do not know that Nassim's death.
When they know that he was killed,
wherever,
we can no longer keep
and it will be the burning!
Dear Imam, my hands are tied.
They even gave me a miracle.
What hell will still greet us?
You see these women?
If we agree to follow
and do what they ask,
a thousand paradises will open!
Who's there?
Yvonne, open.
That's all I have.
With a little hashish,
this will bring down a camel.
Chop, mince
Stack, crushed
Grind end, be generous
Strength of the mixture
Choose the best cam
A piece that is worth gold
Blonde or brown
it did not matter
Added-in, do not be afraid,
It is hashish in my heart
He drowns, he needs a buoy
Roll it, knead it
Kneads it, stretch the
Braid it, return it and cook it
A heat
Choose the best cam
a piece that is worth gold
Blond or red,
let it float
Added-in, n 't be afraid
It is hashish in my heart
He drowns, he needs a buoy

It's good with the juice.
No, thank you.
Why? Do me a favor.
It's very good.
You are welcome.
A juice,
pending the cure?
Bon appetit.
Meanwhile Sheikh ...
It is where the mayor?
He sulks,

Do not worry,

Health, my friend!
Health, asshole!
Do not worry.
I'm not his type.
Eight ...
- Nine ...

On K7,

Spare us your science, Einstein.
This is the south.
Go ahead and continue.
Where was I?
New ...
Ten ...
Eleven ...
Wait, Amal. Expect.
They counted in sizes for men.
You, the hose 36.
Approach you,

You've crushed my foot!
Excuse me, darling.
Where were we?
Fourteen ...
Fifteen ...
Nice work, Katia!
Allah ...
"Allah be thanked
for its benefits. "
You started with yoga?
That's it,
it has spun between the legs!
You took your painkillers, my darling?
It's over,
it has tripped there.
The line is cut with the Virgin?
This is the end of the beans!
Mass is said.
Come to do your morning prayer,
by the Prophet,
and go wash your mouth.
"By the Prophet"?
Hail Mary full of grace,
The Lord is with you ...
Everything is fine, Mom?
What is this?
What is this thing?
What happened to you, mom?
What are you wearing?
Where are the girls?
They are gone?
Why you do not answer, Mom?
Hey Mom, you've tripped?
Shut up, you go to church.
At Mass?
It is in this outfit
I'll walk through the village.
Hear ye, good people!
Come and see me!
I travel lightly dressed.
What the dico under the pillow?
This is the book of God.
It is the Gospel.
Henceforth, it will be that
my holy book, the Gospel!
Come down to open the door,
otherwise I get high
and break your face!
Smash my face?
As to your neighbor George?
Just yesterday,
you ate hummus with him,
by calling my Gigi,
my friend, my brother!
Now you want to kill him?
Because elsewhere,
they are at war?
Want to cut it into pieces?
I am one of them, now.
I am Georgette.
Come and begin with me.
Just kill me.
This is my new outfit
remember it well. I'm leaving!
Where?
In the depths of hell!
It is this hand which,
on the door?
This is the hand that will strangle you
if you keep your bullshit.
Lance still ripe!
Want to ridicule me?
It is you who ridicule us.
You make us crazy!
The die is cast.
You can not help it.
Curse you!
It is already cursed.
You've burned the heart.
There is no hope.
What are you wearing?
What is this?
Do you like it not?
Divorce!
But I dream!
Where are you going?
A Mecca.
May God punish you,
Father Constantine!
We got out, you think?
Down here, perhaps.
But up there, not sure.
Now, you live with the enemy.
What did you do?
I'm one of them, now.
What can you still do?
Go, get up.
We must bury your brother.
My story, I told
And to you, I have entrusted
The story of a village wake in peace
When there was fighting all around
In men who have fallen asleep
To stand up without war, amazed
Women always dressed in black
Armies of prayers and hope
Their war is without rancor
And to protect their
They took their destiny
And found a new way ...
And now we're going where?
