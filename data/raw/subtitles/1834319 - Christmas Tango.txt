THE CHRISTMAS TANGO
Sorry
Excuse me
Mr. Lazarou,
one moment please.
We must have it today.
It's for our mother.
I'll see what I can do.
Please wait.
- If she doesn't find it?
- We'll look elsewhere.
Don't worry.
How long?
Good. Thank you.
You're in luck.
- It'll be here in two hours.
- Perfect.
- Will you be coming by?
- Yes. Thank you.
Excuse me.
- I can't make it in two hours.
- I'll come, don't worry.
Mr. Lazarou?
Your eucalyptus drops.
Do you hear me?
Lazarus, are you home?
Why aren't you answering your mobile?
We're expecting you at rehearsal.
If you get this, call me.
Evros 1970
Three years into the Greek
Military coup - near the border
Vati Military Camp.
Hello?
Did you miss it?
- Damn it...
- You fell asleep again?
The transfers will be
announced in a week.
The Brigadier General
in Didimotiho assured me.
We're going to Athens, dear.
In a month we'll be in Athens!
I'm leaving.
Don't forget that we're going
to the officer's club tonight.
- Good morning, Colonel.
- No time for that, Paraskevi.
- Is our girl up yet?
- Not yet.
If she's not up in an hour,
go wake her.
It's a gloomy day outside.
I couldn't get out of bed either.
Call the hairdresser. There
is a show at the club tonight.
Don't worry.
Drive carefully.
Colonel!
What are we going
to do about the shopping?
Nothing. I'll send
them over with the driver.
As you wish.
Good morning, Commander.
Here we go again...
Company! Attention!
Shoulder arms!
Order arms!
At ease!
How are the rehearsals going,
Shakespeare?
We'll be the laughing stock.
Did anyone speak?
No one?
Arms up!
One-two, kneel continuously.
Start!
One-two, kneel!
The deeper we go,
The stronger we grow!
The deeper we go,
The stronger we grow!
Company, at ease!
Attention!
I'm honoured to report
that all are present!
- One referred.
- What did he do?
His boots were dirty and
his laces were untied.
Five days without leave.
- Anything else?
- No, Commander.
At ease!
Major... Lieutenant...
I need to talk to you.
Company, attention!
Dismissed!
Do you have any news about
the transfers, Commander?
We're leaving after the holidays.
Athens, Voskopoulos.
Congratulations, Commander.
That was it for Evros.
Did you hear, Karamanidis?
Our Commander is moving on!
Are you coming in?
It's Christmas in four days.
We'll start preparing for
the celebration as of today.
I want everything to be perfect.
You're on leave duty.
No-one gets any leave until
the celebration, no one gets out.
- I'll see to it, Commander Sir.
- Voskopoulos.
I want the camp, the halls
and the court decorated.
We'll even decorate the toilets.
The Christmas play has
already been arranged.
I assigned it to the operator.
He's an artist you know.
Did they bring the manger?
Karamanidis,
what about the manger?
They brought it this morning,
Commander Sir.
I want the kitchens, the walls,
the gate, everything painted.
- Music? Will we have any?
- If it were up to me, we wouldn't.
Or dancing that is. But it's a
celebration so we can't avoid it.
Our last celebration with you
can't be without any music?
Let it be then...
with music, Voskopoulos.
But music that will lift the
spirit of our men, not any of...
We can book the band that I'm
bringing tonight to the club.
You are coming to the club
tonight, aren't you?
With your wife of course.
We'll be there.
- Is there anything else, Sir?
- No, go.
Get up, Zoe.
Wake up my girl.
The hairdresser just arrived.
Aren't you going
to the officer's club tonight?
- I don't feel like going.
- Why not? Here we go again!
Mom! The hairdresser is here.
She said she'll do my hair too.
- Come on, mom.
- Go on and I'll be right there.
You'll catch a cold walking
around barefoot. Get up, Zoe.
The Colonel will call to see
what we're up to.
He'll blame me.
It's raining again.
I must be home for Christmas Sir.
The olive trees...
My brother is serving too and
my father only has two hands!
- No one leaves until Christmas.
- The trees need trimming.
The trees need trimming and you
some jail time. End of story!
Go.
- Logos.
- With that oddball.
Stop it, Maria!
- Colonel!
- How are we all tonight?
The band is alright, Voskopoulos.
A few crew cuts would
make them even better.
A toast to the transfers!
Which should be arriving
at any moment now.
They are taking so long has
the truck broken down?
You, Zoe?
Are you looking forward to it?
- Excuse me.
- You were distracted, my Zoe.
Military talk.
Greece can sleep peacefully
because we are awake.
What will you have,
Lieutenant, Sir?
No more.
Is that an order?
Excuse me.
- Would you like to dance?
- Some other time.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
I'm listening.
- Can we talk about it tomorrow?
- No.
- I demand you tell me now!
- You'll wake up the child!
Answer my question!
I don't have a good time
at the club. Happy now?
And everyone had to know this?
Imagine what they thought of you.
- I don't care what they think.
- But I care. And I'm serious!
Don't shout at me,
I'm not one of your soldiers.
You're a spoiled brat,
that's what you are!
If you don't get your way
you'll do as you please!
I only wanted to dance.
That's all.
Leave it.
Why are you avoiding me, Zoe?
I don't want to.
One more.
An Army truck has arrived.
It might be the Colonel,
come on.
On the right... in the living room.
Come in.
It's from the Colonel. A gift
for you and the little one.
Put it by the fireplace,
on the left.
Come on, guys!
You're angels... heads up!
Head up, my little angel...
We want to see your pretty face.
Cut it out!
He knows you are messing about!
Mess about Angels... mess
All of you, go back.
Two steps forward
and we raise our arms.
Glory to God
in the highest heaven...
And peace on earth...
Unto those
whom his favour rests.
Bravo! Halleluiah!
Vati Military Camp.
Hello?
- Lazarus?
- Eleni?
Mother is not well.
- What happened?
- I brought her to the hospital.
It's her heart.
They told me it's serious.
- Can't you come?
- Put her on the phone.
They're examining her.
Take leave.
I can't.
You must come.
Try.
- I'll see what I can do.
- That's not enough.
I'm all alone.
Come.
Do it for our mother.
Hurry up!
You're wasting all the water.
And then he looked at me
and didn't say a word.
- Then he left.
- I smell jail time.
I'm not feeling well.
Next time jerk off,
you'll let some steam off.
My mother is ill.
I must go, Doc.
I must take leave.
Lazarus, talk of the devil
Karamanidis is looking for you.
- He's taking a bath.
- You'll freeze out there.
Ask for a leave, you
must leave by tomorrow.
Duty leave from Karamanidis?
Not even a sleigh
can get you out of here.
Enter!
- You requested me, Commander Sir?
- Present yourself.
Private Lazarus Lazarou,
At your command!
Approach.
- You're an operator, right?
- Yes, Sir.
- And what are you?
- The operator of the battalion.
I'm not talking about
the battalion.
What did you do before?
- As a civilian?
- Be clear, damn it!
What were you before
you became a soldier?
I was studying Political Sciences
at Panteion University.
What else?
I enrolled
in the School of Philosophy.
- And something else maybe?
- I don't understand the question.
Close the door.
Will there be dancing
and singing?
That thing you're teaching the
soldiers. Will there be dancing?
They'll recite a poem,
Lieutenant Sir!
Do you know how to dance,
Lazarou?
I asked you something.
Do you know how to dance?
Dance what?
That damn thing where your
legs get tangled. You know it?
- I do.
- Tango?
- Tango for man and for woman?
- Yes.
- Was that just a yes, Lazarou?
- Yes, Commander, Sir!
- You mean you know the steps.
- Yes, Sir!
Good.
You can go now.
Be here after lights out.
Lieutenant,
they called me from home...
If I find out that you told
anybody, you're dead meat.
Yes, Lieutenant Sir!
- I understand.
- You understand nothing.
Lieutenant, they called me
from home. My family...
Do you know any records
with tangos?
Write it down.
- This one.
- Good. Go...
Evros you know
has great needs.
Are you saying that the
transfer might be compromised?
No, I'm saying that our army
needs dedicated people like you.
Especially nowadays.
- I've proved my dedication.
- Dedication goes without saying.
Our Revolution demands alertness.
Our priority is the best interest
of our country.
I'm positive that your priority
is the good of the country.
The good of the country above all,
Brigadier General.
However, this transfer
is extremely important...
- How is our charming, Mrs. Logos?
- For my family.
Thank you, she is fine.
She was wondering if you'd honour
us with your presence for dinner.
It would be my pleasure.
I always enjoy your company.
I would like, if it's not
a problem, to avoid...
I mean I don't want
Zoe to find out...
about
this possible cancellation.
She'll be extremely upset.
You understand.
I do. Such a beautiful lady with
a child in the middle of nowhere...
it's difficult.
Don't worry.
Just know that
what doesn't happen today...
might happen tomorrow,
my dear.
- Around nine.
- We'll be expecting you.
- Is it true what they say?
- What?
- That you're getting a transfer.
- Keep your eyes on the road!
Daddy is here!
- Sweetheart!
- Look. We decorated the tree.
- Well done. Did you like it?
- Yes.
Next year bring a bigger one,
one that'll reach the sky.
We're preparing for the Christmas
celebration at the camp too.
If it weren't for this weather,
we'd be ready.
But I have a big surprise
for you. Music!
A band will be playing, my dear.
For you.
Dancing, singing.
I thought you'd be happy.
Paraskevi, the Brigadier General
is eating with us tonight.
- Bake one of his favourite pies.
- Yes, Mr. Manolis.
Let's put the star on the top.
I can't reach it by myself.
Eat so you'll get taller
just like your daddy...
...see where the stars came
and rested on his shoulder.
- I want you to be beautiful.
- Is that the one he likes?
We must get that transfer.
- I don't care about the transfer.
- Yes, you do.
And I care too. And this time,
we're going to get it.
I'll go check on the child.
Enter!
Come.
- Did anyone see you?
- No one.
- The glasses?
- They are for reading.
I should be wearing them
all the time, but they tire me.
Is there enough time until
the Christmas celebration?
- Time for what?
- So I can learn how to tango.
I requested to be on duty
until Christmas.
If we start tonight, now,
will there be enough time?
- You mean for me to teach you?
- That's what I mean.
And take the glasses off! I didn't
call you here to read with me!
I know nothing about the tango,
Lazarou...
I want to be able to dance
by Christmas.
You see, they didn't teach us
how to dance in the army academy.
One's will to dance
is all but a... decision, Sir.
It's the driver, Lieutenant.
I came for the inspection.
Get the jeep started
and I'll be there.
Lieutenant...
I request leave!
I must go home.
I'll go check the look-out posts
and I'll be back.
Don't move.
Argyrouli! Come, boy!
Let's go for inspection.
- Halt! Identify yourself!
- Inspection!
That's not even on, Lazarou.
Come, time is of the essence.
Sit.
Lieutenant Sir... She's ill.
My mother...
- If I could get some leave...
- Let's start from the beginning.
Firstly, we approach the person
we want to dance with, right?
I'm talking here!
We approach the person.
Isn't that
what we're supposed to do?
- The partner.
- What partner?
- The partner is the lady.
- I'll call her lady, Lazarou.
- Get it?
- As you wish, Sir.
We approach the lady.
And what do we tell her?
I would be honoured if you
danced this tango with me.
Just a moment,
I'll write it down.
It depends of course
on... who the lady is.
A lady is always a lady, Lazarou.
Let's go on.
Secondly.
We help her stand up
if she is sitting.
She'll be sitting.
And we take her by her hand
to the dance-floor...
to start dancing the tango.
Thirdly?
We take the lady's right arm
with our left arm...
and we slowly place our right arm
around her waist.
Me left, her right.
Right hand around the waist.
There's one arm missing.
The lady will put her left arm
softly on her partner's shoulder.
Left arm on partner's shoulder.
Then?
Then we have the legs.
They are most essential.
Why's that?
Because we'll use them
to dance the tango.
Cut the crap then and dance!
Come on. Get up.
- Me?
- You're the teacher.
Dance.
We're done with the theory.
- I need music.
- You need nothing.
Count in your head.
To show you the dance I need
a partner, I mean a lady.
Want me to bring you
a woman in here?
Start dancing.
It takes two to tango.
Take your boots off.
Take them off!
If you teach me how to dance
by Christmas Eve...
you will be on your way home.
You'll see your mother
on Christmas day.
Eucalyptus drops.
I don't like bad breath.
Come.
- You'll be the... lady.
- As you wish, Commander Sir!
With our left arm,
the lady's right arm...
and the right arm
around the waist.
One back, one side...
One, two...
No.
Two forward and one cross.
You cross from behind. The
opposite from what I'm doing.
Step forward, step to the side...
And close.
Good?
Let's try it once more.
One, two, three, four...
Watch it, Lazarou. If I don't
learn, you're dead meat!
Get it?
And... One, two...
three, four...
- We thank you very much.
- I thank you.
For the good company
and the great food.
- Say goodnight to Zoe for me.
- Forgive me, she fell asleep.
The child...
The rain stopped.
I'll do whatever I can,
You can be sure of that.
Even though I'll miss these
nice evenings with you.
We thank you very much.
Company!
At ease!
As you know yesterday's
and today's rain...
ruined the walls we painted.
The walls look like,
I better not say...
and since we can't have
a party in this mess...
we'll paint them again.
- Balaskas and Anastasiou!
- At your service!
Go get the buckets
with the paint.
As soon the rain stops,
start painting!
I'll be back.
I won't be long.
Good evening.
It arrived this morning.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Bye.
The rain stopped and
the weather is all better now.
- Last night was terrible!
- Hand me my robe.
- They brought a gift.
- What gift?
I don't know.
I have it in the hall.
- Who brought it?
- I found it by the door.
They must have brought it
a while ago. What is it?
A record... With music...
- "Tango Notturno".
- Mr. Manolis must have sent it.
I was in the kitchen and I didn't
hear the soldier who brought it.
Did you have a nice time
with the Grenadier General?
Tango...
I made Fricassee with lamb.
You can find turkey anywhere.
Get to the gate,
Voskopoulos is waiting for you.
Your sister is waiting for you.
She called three times today.
She said not to call her,
no one will be home.
- Anything else?
- She said she'll call you.
Have a drink.
It'll be good for you.
Vati Military Camp.
The Commander, please
It's Mrs. Logos.
Commander Sir,
your wife is on the phone.
Put her through.
- Hello, my love.
- Thank you for the record.
What record?
What music is this?
I can't hear a thing!
The tango.
What tango?
Zoe...
The 'lady'...
- Call my wife again.
- Immediately!
This is the hymn of our times.
Tolis (singer) is my cousin.
On my father's side.
You remember.
- She's not answering.
- She's not? Fine.
I have to go home.
Keep your eyes peeled, Voskopoulos.
Painting... brushing...
- Greek Army my ass!
- It's raining constantly.
My fuckin' luck!
I have to paint the whole of Soufli
so Logos can have his Christmas.
- Do it for his wife.
- What will she do for me?
- What she won't do for Logos.
- Then I'll paint all of Evros!
Hungry are you?
Eat!
Let the dog go, you jerk!
Want me to make you eat it?
- Will you touch the dog again?
- Let him go, Lieutenant Sir.
It was just a joke.
A joke...
It would be a joke
for me too.
Zoe.
Paraskevi?
Is anyone here?
Zoe!
What is it, dear?
What do you want?
- I want those angels.
- Alright.
I have plenty of angels!
If he returns home and doesn't
find us... he'll be furious.
He'll start with me first.
Paraskevi...
Don't tell Manolis
anything about the record.
- He didn't send it.
- I smell trouble this Christmas.
If I tell him that I brought it?
To surprise you.
He won't believe it.
I'll say that I put it
on your bed, you woke up...
I wasn't there.
We'll tell him the truth.
We don't know.
Some things are best not said.
I'll think of something.
Even God fears
the truth sometimes.
Zoe...
Mister Manolis
loves you very much.
"My girls".
That's all I hear him say.
Shall we?
Come, dear.
We're leaving.
You scared me.
The next time you go out
let me know first, please.
We went for a walk.
I left the office in a rush...
thinking that something happened
to you... you went for a walk?
- Colonel, I asked her to go out.
- Take the baby inside.
We're not calling her "baby"
again. Her name is Elizabeth.
Your wish is my command,
Mrs. Logos.
Together we can go everywhere,
wherever you please.
Walking around without
me is not appropriate.
You understand that, right?
Did you find out
who sent that record?
I don't know.
It must've been a mistake. They
wanted to send it somewhere else.
Right?
I don't know, Manolis.
Am I dismissed?
Come in. Close the door,
take your boots off...
You will remain out of sight
if anyone asks for me.
You won't say a word.
- The drops are here.
- Yes, Lieutenant Sir.
Hurry up.
Did we have any
news concerning my leave?
We discussed that already?
You tango, me leave.
I have to go.
- My sister is waiting...
- For now, take your position.
- Remember what we did yesterday?
- We didn't do shit yesterday.
If you carry on with this pace,
forget about the leave...
and start counting jail time.
Are we clear?
- The arm...
- I know.
My arm around your waist.
Three, two, one, and...
One back, two side,
three, four...
- Let's do it again.
- And...
One, two, three...
Stop counting, you're
confusing me. You better sing.
- I can't think of something.
- Think harder.
Sing.
In summer...
we'd go together
to the sandy beach...
holding hands and
with a star by our side.
Now we shorten the distance.
And we dare put our left leg...
between the legs of the lady.
Exactly, Sir.
Our leg softly touches
the leg of the lady.
I think we're doing very well,
Lieutenant.
I won't be dancing with you,
you idiot!
What I meant to say
is that you are ready.
You will dance, I promise you.
I don't trust you,
Lazarus Lazarou.
I don't trust people with names
of the resurrected.
I, on the other hand,
trust you.
Hello?
What?
Where?
I'm coming.
We're finished for today,
Lazarou. Go.
Go, I said!
Who the hell... Won't I
catch you littering my yard?
They give birth wherever they can!
You're up, Colonel?
- Good morning, Paraskevi.
- Merry Christmas.
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Merry Christmas.
- May we be well next year too.
- We'll be well and in Athens.
God is great!
Glory to God
in the highest heaven...
And peace on earth...
Unto those on whom
his favour rests.
And "Merry Christmas" and
we're ready for our celebration.
- You've nailed it!
- Of course, we're angels.
You caught a cold, Mr. Director.
You're weak and it's showing.
Maybe your friend, the doctor,
should see you.
I'm perfectly fine.
Lazarou, they're all
looking for you.
- Who?
- At the telephone office.
- What birds are these?
- Turkeys, Commander.
- I hope they're tasty.
- Delicious!
Don't overcook them,
I want an aesthetic presentation.
- What's that?
- Explain to him.
The food must look
nothing like you!
Butterball!
- Attention!
- As you were.
As you can see,
the hall is almost ready.
It's starting to look nice.
The band will sit here and we'll
leave this space for dancing.
- What about the band?
- I booked them.
They'll come to rehearse
this afternoon.
- Crew cut?
- No hair or sideburns.
We put the manger there. You'll
give your speech over there too...
and then the soldiers
will do their Christmas play.
Tell me, Voskopoulos. What
animal is this? A dinosaur?
- It's a camel, Sir.
- A camel.
It looks like something between
a hippo and a pharaoh.
Where's the Mairy
and the Holy Child?
They were lost on the way.
I forgot to tell you.
What will we do without
a Mairy and a Holy Child?
- We have a palm-tree, Joseph...
- Those are the three wise men.
Right. I just noticed
they are bearing gifts.
You're mumbling and I'm
beginning to loose my patience.
You can rely on me. This party
will be unforgettable!
That's what I'm afraid of. It will
be remembered as the worst.
Push them back, we
don't want to scare the guests.
It's coming along nicely,
Mrs. Logos.
Red suites you.
Just a moment... one more.
No more. It's fine.
If we leave it like that
your shoulders will show.
Why because I'm married
and it's inappropriate?
Isn't this the way girls
my age wear them?
You're right.
You're so young.
Are you sure, Zoe?
What about Mr. Manolis?
I'm sure.
Maybe you should ask him.
He is your husband.
She fell into a coma yesterday.
She just woke up.
You must come, Lazarus.
I'll come tomorrow. They're
granting me leave... They promised.
- Leave now.
- I have to be here tomorrow.
I'll take the morning train
and I'll be there by nightfall.
- How is she now?
- She's hallucinating.
She's not making any sense.
She thinks I am you.
She's dying, Lazarus.
Do you hear me?
Mother is dying.
Lazarus... Lazarus!
Where are you going?
You thought
you'd get away so easily?
I have to go to Athens today.
My mother is dying.
I'm sorry.
I'm leaving, Lieutenant.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Lazarou.
A ticket to Athens.
Mother!
Congratulations, miss.
You deserve a huge hug.
See, Colonel?
Mom is teaching me poems.
Can I say one at the party?
You can say as many as you wish.
What sort of dress is this, Zoe?
Come, my child.
Let daddy rest.
- Her name is Elizabeth.
- You know best.
Come, Elizabeth.
Time for your bath.
Demetris will pick us up
tomorrow morning at eleven.
I want you to be ready.
I won't be coming, find an excuse.
Think of your position.
You are Mrs. Logos.
- You are the wife of a colonel.
- A lieutenant colonel.
I demand you respect me!
What are you looking at me for?
Your uniform
will be ironed and in the closet.
- Wear it and go.
- Don't turn your back at me!
- You'll stand there and listen.
- Want me to stand like a soldier?
Pull yourself together.
It's your duty.
I need you by my side tomorrow.
I'm struggling for the transfer.
So we can go to Athens.
You're not getting it,
Manolis.
It's not a matter of geography.
I won't be making it to the party.
Tomorrow at the party,
play this...
I'm back, Lieutenant.
Why did you come?
Because I know how it feels
not having what you want.
Not having anything.
To be alone.
Have you ever been in love,
Lazarou?
- Once.
- And was it true love?
- I think so.
- If you "think" it wasn't.
- It was.
- It wasn't.
Have you ever
made a fool of yourself?
Damned love, demands that
you make a fool of yourself!
You didn't tango.
Drink.
Let's dance.
I'm fine.
If the love you say is true,
you must dance.
You're soaking wet.
Take your jacket off.
The goddess of love
hasn't favoured me.
I don't know you and
I don't want to know you.
The only thing I wanted was
to dance the damn tango.
You will dance, Sir.
You will dance. Come.
Come, we don't have much time.
The party is tomorrow.
"Tango Notturno".
Now...
you must trust me too,
Lieutenant.
That's it.
You're ready, Lieutenant Sir.
We're dancing.
You're dancing.
How long does a tango last?
Two minutes.
- Around there.
- All this for nothing.
No, don't say that.
In those two minutes...
you can have
what you really desire.
What did you do?
Lazarou!
What did you do?
I'm talking to you, you jerk!
Wake up!
I'm talking to you! Wake up!
Don't do this to me!
Wake up, Lazarou!
Wake up, this is an order!
Halt!
Identify yourself!
Go get wake up the driver!
Quickly!
Put him down here.
Doctor!
Wake up, doctor!
He's dying!
Hold on, Lazarou!
I think he has pneumonia.
To the hospital.
Come on!
Put him in there!
Get in! Go!
Hold on, Lazarou.
Hold on.
Zoe, you're not coming.
A lot of strange things have
been happening lately.
I find
cigarette-ends in the yard.
A record comes out of nowhere.
Now you're not coming to
the party. What's wrong?
Talk to me. What's up?
I'll get over it.
Go on.
They are waiting for you.
Merry Christmas.
Attention!
- Be seated.
- At ease!
Your spouse?
She wasn't feeling well.
She really wanted to be here.
To conclude, I would like to
express my endless gratitude...
to all of you who honoured
me and our camp...
with your presence.
Merry Christmas to all.
Fear not.
For, behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy.
An angel of the Lord
stood by them.
And the glory of the lord
shone around them.
And they feared fear terribly.
And the angel said unto them,
here is the Lord.
You're up next.
And now, our dearest
Elizabeth Logos...
the only daughter
of our Commander...
will tell us a poem
about Christmas.
Newborn Jesus I dreamt
of last night
His one eye was swollen
so he kept it shut tight.
Although it was painful
he smiled and pulled together his might.
As soon as he grew up he put on
a pair of glasses despite.
You came, Karamanidis?
How's that soldier doing?
His name is Lazarou.
He's in hospital.
On Christmas Day?
Some luck he's got.
Identify yourself!
Lieutenant
Stephanos Karamanidis.
- Why are you alone?
- I'm waiting for my partner.
What's a partner?
That's the lady that will
be dancing with me tonight.
My mom knows how to dance.
Where were you?
I've been looking for you.
- Wherever I wish!
- Come here!
Mommy!
Good for you!
You did the right thing.
- Merry Christmas, Manolis.
- Thank you very much for coming.
Merry Christmas to all of us!
Elizabeth!
Paraskevi, take the child home.
It's late.
Colonel, I have something
very pleasant to announce.
I would be honoured if you
danced this tango with me.
Thank you very much.
What's your name?
Lieutenant Stephanos Karamanidis.
- I'm Zoe.
- I know.
I sent you the tango record.
I didn't have the courage
to write my name.
So it was you.
Forgive my audacity.
- Please.
- Don't plead.
Pleading is not allowed
when one is in the Army, right?
You are correct.
Where did you learn to dance
so beautifully, Lieutenant?
A friend says that one's will to
dance, is all but a decision.
I wanted to dance so much!
I love you.
I've loved you from
the first moment I saw you.
I love you.
Do you believe in fairytales?
I know no such things.
I've been waiting for you.
I only wanted to tell you
that I love you. Just that...
And that I made a fool of myself.
A fool of myself.
You didn't.
You danced so beautifully.
We're leaving, dear.
The transfer came through.
- Did you like our party?
- It was good.
Merry Christmas.
Get going.
Even Karamanidis danced tonight.
The lieutenant that danced
the tango with you.
Excuse me.
You were here this afternoon.
- I knew your father.
- My father?
And you recognized me
because you knew my father?
It might sound crazy, but
you're a spitting image of him.
Everyone would say that I didn't
look anything like him.
Even I said so,
from pictures I've seen.
Pictures?
My father died when I was young.
He died...
- Where did you know him from?
- From the Army.
Forgive me for the disturbance.
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Karamanidis.
Logos.
You must have mistaken
me for someone else.
No, I haven't.
Your father was
a lieutenant colonel, right?
He was my commander.
Is your mother alive?
She is, but she's ill.
The medicine is for her.
Could I visit her? I have
something that belongs to her.
"The breathless wind wouldn't
let us walk straight..."
"...and licked harshly
at the fine lines..."
"...of the beautiful head."
- Good morning.
- Come in.
She might not remember you.
It's getting harder
for her lately. This way.
Hello.
You haven't changed a bit.
Just as beautiful as you were then.
- As when?
- As I remember you.
- You?
- Long ago.
It was Christmas...
In Evros...
At the camp your husband
was commanding.
I remember you.
You did well to come.
Lieutenant.
I don't want to burden you
any longer.
This is for you.
Give me a moment.
Every Christmas...
Identical cards...
It was comforting that
someone was thinking of me.
And this is for you.
If you could come
for a while.
