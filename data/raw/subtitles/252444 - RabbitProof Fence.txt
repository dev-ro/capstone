[Women chanting
in native language]
[Music continues]
This is a true story...
story of my sister Daisy
and my cousin Gracie and me
when we were little.
Our people, the Jigalong mob,
we were desert people then,
walking all over our land.
My mum told me
about how the white people
came to our country.
They made a storehouse
here at Jigalong...
brought clothes and other
things... flour, tobacco, tea.
Gave them to us on ration day.
We came there,
made a camp nearby.
They were building
a long fence.
[Wind blowing]
[Birds chirping]
My dad was a white man
working on that fence.
The white people
called me a half-caste.
[Birds chirping]
[Bird screeches]
[Girl speaking
native language]
See that bird?
That's the spirit bird.
He will always look after you.
[Screeches]
[Bird screeching]
[Children laughing]
Hey, granddaughter,
watch where you run.
You kids
will destroy the tracks.
He's here somewhere.
[Child shouting
in native language]
Keep looking.
Maybe over there.
[Birds chirping]
Here they are. Look.
He's going this way.
See the tracks.
Here, here... in the tree.
Watch out for his claws.
[Hissing]
Good hunters in this family.
[Leather creaking]
[Woman speaking
native language]
You're growing up fast,
Molly.
[Growls]
[Laughter]
MAN: That's them.
Yeah.
Molly's the big one.
The little one's
her sister, Daisy.
The middle one's
their cousin Gracie.
Well,
what about their fathers?
Moved on.
[Girl speaking
native language]
[Speaking native language]
[Baby crying]
Fat one.
[Horse snorts]
[Bird screeching]
Molly, hide those kids.
[Girl speaking

WOMAN: Next batch.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
There's 2 applications
for Section 63 exemptions.
The police reports are there.
William Harris is applying
for permission to marry...
uh,
she's half-caste also...
and Mary Wilson is applying
for permission
to visit her child
at Moore River.
[Indistinct voices]
She's quite agitated.
[Vehicle horn honks]
Oh, and Gladys Phillips
has written
for permission to buy
some new shoes.
She got a new pair
a year ago.
[Stamp thuds]
Uh, now, this report
from Constable Riggs
about the three little
half-caste girls
at the Jigalong Fence Depot...
Molly, Gracie, and Daisy.
The youngest
is of particular concern.
She's promised
to a full blood.
I'm authorizing their removal.
They're to be taken to
Moore River as soon as possible.
Oh, and, Miss Thomas,
if you could check
that the rate for police
transportation is still,
I believe, 8 pence per mile.
Yes, Mr. Neville.
Thank you.

That country over there,
that's woman country.
You can't go there.
You get big trouble.
[Laughter]
Yeah, I know.
Where your country?
My country?
Down south.
Long way from here.
[Dogs barking]
Our dad works there,
on the rabbit fence.
Yeah?
How far
does rabbit fence go to?
Rabbit-proof fence...
...goes all the way to the sea
down that way.
Right to the top
of Australia.
Longest fence in the world.
And all the way to the sea
down that way.
1,500 miles long.
Keeps the rabbits
on that side of the fence,
keeps the farmland on this side
of the fence.
[Dog barking]
That Molly's going to be
a big girl.
Mr. Neville's been writing to me
about those girls, you know.
You tell that Mr. Devil
Molly not going.
She get married.
You tell that Mr. Devil
he want half-caste kid,
he make his own.
[Laughs]
Frankie.

Come for the three girls,
Maude!
No!
No! This my kids!
Mine!
It's the law, Maude.
You got no say in it.
No! Mine!
[Women screaming]
Mr. Neville's orders!
[Woman screaming
in native language]
Listen. Any running,
and I'll lock your mother up.
Mr. Neville is their
legal guardian.
No!
Keep away from us! No!
- No!
- No!
- [Crying]
- WOMAN: Gracie!
- Give me back my kids!
- Come on, little one.
- You sit up, and you stay.
- [Crying]
- No!
- I've got the papers, Maude!
Not take them!
- No!
- You've got no say in it!
- No!
- Come on!
[Screaming]
No!

[Woman sobbing]
Get in the car!
[Woman sobbing]
[Screaming]
Now, the three of youse...
don't move.
[Sobbing]

There's nothing
you can do here, old girl.
[Speaking native language]
Nothing you can do!

NEVILLE: As you know,
every Aborigine born in this
state comes under my control.
Notice, if you will,
the half-caste child.
And there are ever-increasing
numbers of them.
Now, what is to happen to them?
Are we to allow the creation
of an unwanted third race?
Should the coloreds
be encouraged
to go back to the black,
or should they be advanced
to white status
and be absorbed
in the white population?
Now, time and again,
I am asked by some white man,
"If I marry this colored person,
will our children be black?"
And as chief protector
of Aborigines,
it is my responsibility
to accept or reject
those marriages.
Here...
- [Projector clicks]
...is the answer.
Three generations.
half-blood grandmother,
quadroon daughter,
octoroon grandson.
Now, as you can see,
in the third generation,
or third cross,
no trace of native origin
is apparent.
The continuing infiltration
of white blood
finally stamps out
the black color.
The Aboriginal has
simply been...
bred out.
Now... we come to...
We come to the Moore River
Native Settlement.
Ladies, most of you are familiar
with our work here...
the training of domestic
servants and farm laborers.
I would like to thank you
for your continuing support.
Hundreds of half-caste children
have been gathered up
and brought here
to be given the benefit
of everything our culture has
to offer.
For if we are to fit and train
such children for the future,
they cannot be left as they are.
And in spite of himself,
the native must be helped.

Hello, there.
[Gasps]
A ghost.
You poor dears.
It's such a long way.
You must be exhausted.
Come along. I'll take you
straight to the dormitory.
[Metal rattles]
Quickly.
It's all right.
Come on.
Down you hop.
Come along.
Follow me.
Come along.
Follow me, please.
That's the way.
[Engine revs]
[Latch clicks]
[Door opens]
Come along.
[Hinges creak]
There's some beds there.
The bucket's in the corner.
Hurry up.
[Children whispering]
Back to sleep, the rest of you.
No talking.
[Thud]
[Rattling]
[Bell ringing]
WOMAN: Get up!
All of youse, make your beds!
[Ringing continues]
- [Shutters opening]
- Hurry up.
Tory, Cheryl,
stop running around.
Get them blankets tidy.
[Ringing continues]
What's your name?
Where you from?
[Indistinct conversations]
[Laughter]
You'll get used to it.
Tracker girl, get that bucket!
Take it out now!
What are you standing there
dreaming about?
Hurry up!
[Ringing continues]
Move!
- [Laughter]
- Get out to breakfast now.
Come on.
Go, all of you.
[Ringing continues]
Come on. Now.
Let's go.
[Indistinct conversations]
Come on.
You coming?
[Wood creaking]
WOMAN:
Thank you, children.
Ready for our prayers.
Bow your heads.
Eyes closed.
ALL:
Thank you for the food we eat.
Thank you for the world
so sweet.
Thank you for the birds
that sing.
Thank you, God, for everything.
[Girl coughs]
There will be no talking.
[Plates rattling]
[Mumbles in native language]
[Thud]
We'll have no wonker here.
You talk English!
Now, eat!
Eat!
Or I'll hold your nose
and force it down you!
Here.
Keep still.
I've got to scrub you.
Let me see.
[Flies buzzing]
Doesn't that feel better?
"Yes, Miss Jessop."
Yes, Miss Jessop.
"Thank you, Miss Jessop."
Thank you, Miss Jessop.
That looks much better.
[Water splashing]
[Flies buzzing]
[Machines clicking
and squeaking]
Here.
Take it.
Put these on.
Come on.
Get dressed.
[Machines clicking]
New clothes.
This is your new home.
We don't use
that jabber here.
You speak English.
CHILDREN:? Way down
upon the Swanee River?
? Far, far away?
? There's where my heart
is turning ever?
? There's where
the old folks stay?
[Whispering]
What are they doing?
[Whispering] Singing
Mr. Devil's favorite song.
Eh?
Singing Mr. Devil's
favorite song.
Who's that?
The one on the end
on the chair.
? Longing
for the old plantation?
? And for the old folks
at home?
- Very good.
- Yes.
Well done.
[Keys jingling]
[Dog squeals]
[Whispering]
The following children
will come forward...
Tommy Grant.
[Wind blowing]
[Insects chirping]
This way, Tommy.
- Here.
- Come on.
Stand up straight.
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, boy.
Tommy...
[Whispering]
What are they doing now?
[Whispering] They're checking
for the fair ones.
Why?
They've got to take them
to Sister Kate's.
They're more clever than us.
They can go to proper school.
Thank you.
No.
Thank you.
Good boy.
[Whispering]
Molly Craig.
[Whispering] That you?
[Flies buzzing]
Molly Craig.
[Whispering] Go on. Get up.
[Insects chirping]
Hurry up.
They'll whip you.
[Keys jingling]
Molly...
- Come on, dear.
- [Whispering] Get up. Quick.
Come on, young lady.
[Whispering] They'll put you
in the boob. Hurry up.
Just Molly, please.
Where are you going?
Come back here.
- Sit down.
- MISS JESSOP: Hurry up.
Come along.
It's all right.
That's the way.
Don't be afraid.
[Keys jingling]
Come along.
Come on.
I'm not going to hurt you.
See?
That's better.
That's it.
It's Molly, isn't it?
I know it all feels
very strange,
but after a few days,
you'll feel quite at home.
[Breathing heavily]
We're here to help
and encourage you
in this new world.
Duty, service,
responsibility.
Those are our watchwords.
Molly, keep still.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
[Insects chirping]
[Pen scratching]
[Fly buzzing]
No.
[Baby crying]
GIRL: Over here.
Sweep it over here.
To the door.
Come on. This way.
Push it towards me.
[Horse snorts,
hoofbeats approach]
Hey, tracker girl.
Your dad's bringing Olive back.
He catched her.
[Hoofbeats]
MAN: Thank you, Moodoo.
Stand there, young lady.
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?
Now, stop that crying.
You see
what Miss Doyle has here?
Olive, look at me.
You see this here?
The scissors?
Did she run away home?
Look at them, Olive.
Look at them.
She ran away to see
her boyfriend.
You were told about this
beforehand.
- [Dog squeals]
- Come on.
See if those boys in New Norcia
find you so attractive now, eh?
[Door opens]
[Hinge squeaks]
- [Sobbing]
- In you go.
[Dog barks, whines]
[Snap, Olive shouts]
[Dog barking]
[Shouting continues]
[Indistinct conversations]
She broke out through here.
Usual story...
off to see her boyfriend
at New Norcia.
Mmm.
The tracker brought her back.
Ah, yes. Moodoo.
Mr. Neal tells me
that your probation period is up
and that you wish to return
to the Kimberleys.
Is that right?
Of course, your daughter
is here, isn't she?
[Baby crying]
There would be no question
of her going.
She would have to stay here
and continue her training.
[Birds chirping]
I think for the time being it
would be best for all concerned
if you were to remain here,
Moodoo.
I'd be prepared to consider
your case in a year or so,
but, uh... until then.
[Crying continues]
Mr. Neal, I don't want you
to feel guilty.
MR. NEAL: Yes.
[Baby crying]
Those babies...
where are their mothers?
They've got no mothers.
[Children singing in distance]
Nobody here got any mothers.
I've got mother.
[Crying continues]
[Bell ringing]
Come on.
They're lining up.
Let's go.
[Crying continues]
[Ringing continues]
[Indistinct voices]
[Girl sobbing]
[Man shouting indistinctly]
[Ringing continues]
[Wood creaking]
[Sobbing]
[Sobbing]
Bad place.
They make me sick...
these people.
Sick.
Make me sick.
[Exhales deeply]
[Bell ringing]
Come on. Make your beds.
Nice and tidy.
If you already done it,
get to the church now.
Hurry up.
Stop dawdling.
[Indistinct conversations]
Molly, take the bucket out,
and then the three of you
go up to church.
[Ringing continues]
WOMAN:
Run along. Come on.
Come on, you kids.
Get up there. You're late.
Hurry up.
Get up there now.
[Ringing continues]
[Thunder crashes]
[Thunder rumbling]
Come on. Get your things.
We're going.
Where are we going?
We're going home to Mother.
How we gonna get there?
Walk.
We're not going.
Are we, Daisy?
We like it here.
That tracker, he's gonna get us
and put us in that room.
He's not gonna get us
and put us in the room.
We just keep walking.
The rain will cover our tracks.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Quick.
Come on.
Come on, Gracie. Now.
Too far, Molly.
Hurry up!
[Indistinct conversation]
? He made
their glowing colors?
? He made their tiny wings?
? All things
bright and beautiful?
? All creatures
great and small?
[Water laps]
[Clank]
Come on. Let's go.
Here.
Ellie Moodoo.
Mm-hmm.
Molly Craig.
Molly Craig.
[Coughs]
Molly Craig.
Gracie Fields.
Daisy Kadibil.
[Thunder rumbling]
Nina, have you seen
the new girls?
Haven't seen them all day,
miss.
[Girls laughing]
[Speaking native language]
[Speaking native language]
Mister... Mr. Neville says
you better come real quick.
[Speaking native language]
[Birds chirping, screeching]
[Thunder rumbling]
[Insects buzzing]
[Thunder crashes]
Run, run, run! Quickly!
[Thunder crashing]
[Snorts]
[Neighs]
[Chuckling]
[Crickets chirping,
insects buzzing]
That's two days ago,
Mr. Neal.
Yes, I understand, but I require
to be kept fully informed.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
[Sighs]
Those three girls...
they've run off.
Oh, dear.
Got to be the older one.
I wondered when I saw her.
Too much of their mind.
Unfathomable.
The tracker's onto it.
In the meantime, it must be kept
out of the papers.
No rain.
Tracker gonna get us.
Tracker's not gonna get us!
Come on.
We gotta keep going.
Come on, Gracie.
[Bird screeching]
Daisy, give me your bag.
Give us your bag, quick!
Give us it!
Hurry up! In the water!
In the water!
We need to cover our tracks!
[Horse pants]
Come on, come on.
[Snorts]
[Snorts]
[Splashing]
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
[Sighs]
[Splashing continues]
[Snorts]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Snorts]
[Snorting, splashing]
I see... the emu.
No, that's not it.
I see the kangaroo,
red one.
No.
I don't see nothing.
There's no food here.
I see...
We don't know this place.
[Man speaking indistinctly]
- How are we gonna eat?
- Shh.
Run!
Quick, hide! Come on!
[Branches rattle]
Ask them, Molly.
Ask them for something to eat.
[Branches rattle]
Hey, you're from that
Moore River place, eh?
[Insects buzzing]
We're going home.
Where your country?
Jigalong.
Jigalong?
Proper long way.
[Rustling]
[Rattling]
You know what you're doing?
That tracker
from Moore River...
...he pretty good.
I heard he get them runaways
all the time.
Got to be good to beat him.
He'll take you back
to that place.
Here.
You watch out for him, eh?
[Crickets chirping,
fire crackling]
You think you're so smart?
Where are we?
We're lost.
[Wind howling]
Jigalong that way.
North.
Tracker followed them to...
this river bank,
but lost their tracks in
the water about a week ago.
There's been no sign of them
since.
Three little half-castes.
We're talking quite a few
man-hours here.
Who's going to pay for it?
Well, there's very little money
in my departmental budget.
I'm hoping that if your men
can in some way combine this
with their regular duties...
We'll be able to handle
all the notifications,
posting all the police stations,
farms, et cetera.
We'll provide a description,
of course.
But if my men have to make trips
outside of their duties,
then I'm afraid it'll have to be
an impost on your department.
If your men are out on other
jobs at the same time,
there would be
no extra expense.
I'll concede that,
Mr. Neville.
And it is the job
of every one of your men
in their role
as local protectors.
My men will do their jobs,
Mr. Neville.
Now, a week ago, you said.
Yes.
[Dog barks]
Hey, Maude,
your girls have gone.
What'd you say?
Run away from Moore River.
They're gone.
Everybody's lookin' for 'em.
[Dog barks]
[Thunder rumbles]
[Wind howling,
chickens clucking]
[Clucking intensifies]
And what do you think
you might be up to?
Thieving my eggs, eh?
You come out here
where I can see you.
Come on.
Stand up.
Out you come.
[Clucking continues]
And get rid of that bread.
It's filthy.
You want something to eat,
you ask for it.
Come on.
I'm not gonna bite you.
[Men talking indistinctly]
You on your own?
Hmm?
Got anyone with you?
[Hinges creak]
Papa.
[Radio playing indistinctly]
Where you girls
planning on going?
Cat got your tongue, eh?
Now get.
Go on.
And watch out for those boys
further along.
They go out hunting rabbits
along the fence.
That rabbit-proof fence?
Yes,
the rabbit-proof fence.
Where that rabbit fence?
East.
Which way now?
That way... that fence.
Find that rabbit fence,
we go home.
Then we see our mum.
[Man singing
in native language]
"The chief protector of
Aborigines, Mr. A.O. Neville..."
ALL: Devil!
"...is concerned about
three native girls
"ranging from 8 to 14 years
of age
"who, a month ago, ran away
from the Moore River
Native Settlement."
ALL: Yay!
"He would be grateful
if any person who saw them
"would notify him promptly.
"'We have been searching high
and low for the children
for a month past, '
added Mr. Neville."
ALL: Devil!
'And all the trace we found
of them was a dead rabbit."'
[Laughter]
[Whistles]
It's the fence!
It's the fence! She found it!
[Giggling]
[Giggling continues]
[Rattles]
[Panting]
[Panting continues]
INSPECTOR: The latest sighting,
which is four days old...
The man from the newspaper.
I have nothing more to say
to him. Please, now, move on.
Yes?
Bunnawarra.
Yalgoo.
[Paper rustling]
Dalwallinu.
Bunnawarra. Yalgoo.
Dalwallinu, Bunnawarra,
Yalgoo.
They're on the fence.
They're following
the rabbit-proof fence.
Right.
Just because people use
neolithic tools, Inspector,
does not mean they have
neolithic minds.
This makes our task
very much easier.
Look, there's a branch off here
to the west north of Yalgoo.
Now, you put your man
out here on the fence
north of this junction.
He can start to come down it
to meet them.
I'll have Moodoo come up
from the south behind them.
[Taps]
We can't miss them.
[Vehicle rumbling]
[Horse galloping]
[Crickets chirping]
Where Daisy?
Wait here.
[Panting]
My legs, Molly...
They hurt.
I can't walk.
[Sighs]
I'll carry you only one once,
so there.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't think I'm carrying you
all the way.
[Birds chirping,
horse snorts]
Camp, Molly.
[Woman shouting in distance]
Company.
Where you girls headed?
[Fire crackling,
water bubbling]
You goin' to Mullewa?
You got family there?
Where Mullewa?
Mullewa?
West.
Why, you're headed along
the number-2 fence.
You got two
rabbit-proof fence?
Why, uh,
we got three of 'em.
We're on the wrong fence.
[Groans]
Where the north fence?
North fence?
Back that way,
where you come from.
You can cut across.
I'll show you.
Number-1 rabbit fence.
Here's the number-2 fence.
Now, you're here.
But you wanna be here.
Now,
if you cut across here...
you'll save yourself
a hundred mile or so.
It's not hard.
[Snorts]
I'm goin' back.
I don't have the petrol.
[Crickets chirping]
[Radio playing indistinctly]
[Whistles]
Over here.
And we hungry.
[Panting]
Youse that lot
from Moore River.
Yeah.
What, you girls walk
all that way?
Hmm.
800 miles.
- I was there.
- [Insect buzzes]
Too scared to run away,
but everyone was always caught,
stuck in that boob.
Youse got the furtherest.
Where you headin'?
Home.
WOMAN: Mavis!
[Gasps]
Stay here.
I'll come back and get you.
You can sleep with me tonight.
I'll get you some food.
[Footsteps running]
Just getting the washing,
Mrs. Evans!
[Radio continues playing]
[Wind howling]
[Shutters banging]
[Crickets chirping]
[Footsteps approaching]
MOLLY: Shh. What's that?
DAIS Y: Someone coming.
Quick, quick! In the bed!
Under the blankets!
[Exhales deeply]
[Lock unlatches]
[Hinges creak]
[Groans]
[Girls gasp]
[Hinges creak]
MAN: Damn you, Mavis.
MAVIS: Mr. Evans.
I'll get you for this.
Go away.
Don't you worry about that.
Come on, quick. Get up.
Get up. Come on.
Shh, shh, shh.
[Hinges creak]
Don't go, Molly.
Please don't go.
He come back if you go.
[Sobbing]
Don't go.
He won't say anything.
Please.
[Wind howling]
[Shutters creaking]
[Vehicle approaching]
[Brakes squeak]
[Engine stops]
[Door opens, closes]
Paul Evans?
MRS. EVANS: Hello.
[Whispering] Wake... wake up!
Wake up! You gotta go!
Let's have a look.
[Whispering] Run that way!
Just keep going!
MR. EVANS: They were
running out over there
about an hour or so ago.
We'll pick up their tracks
in the morning.
MRS. EVANS:
I'll make a cup of tea.
[Dog barks]
[Whispering]
That's the tracker.
[Dog barking]
Yeah, that's him.
[Panting]
MOLLY: Hop on.
[Grunts]
I do not expect you
to understand
what I am trying to do
for these people,
but I will not have my plans
put into jeopardy.
People fail to understand that
the problem of half-castes
is not simply
going to go away.
If it is not dealt with now, it
will fester for years to come.
These children
are that problem.
Please explain
exactly what happened.
I don't know how they did it,
but we lost them.
Had Larson out there,
Moodoo was with him,
and we lost them.
They're making
right fools of us.
They are indeed, Inspector,
and the cost is more
than to just our pride.
The reputation
of this department
is beginning to suffer.
I can assure you that my men
have better things to do
than chase your charges
all around the country.
[Sighs]
They're coming into
very rough terrain.
Once they're
much past Meekatharra...
I can't risk any of my men.
I agree... we must find them
before they get into
the real desert country.
So, [Exhales]...
this is what we're going to do.
You get your man up there.
Moodoo can join him.
Well up the fence...
around here, hmm?
Far enough up so that we know
we cannot possibly miss them.
And I want them
to stay there.
They can set up camp
and wait.
Costly?
Well, we'll just
have to bear it.
Their lives may be at stake.
And, Inspector, I understand
the mother of one of the girls
has gone to Wiluna.
The children are headed
into that country.
I want the word spread.
Let's see what that does.
[Sniffs]
[Insects chirping]
You wouldn't get me out there.
She's pretty clever,
that girl.
She wants to go home.
MAN: Good thing
you kids ran into me.
Lot of people
worried for you.
The police are up and down
the country looking for youse.
It's in all the papers.
Which one of you is Gracie?
You Gracie?
I hear your mummy in Wiluna.
You can catch a train there
from Meeka.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wiluna?
Is she at Wiluna?
Yes.
Come on, Gracie.
Don't listen to him.
He's a liar.
GRACIE:
Maybe she's there, Molly.
Maybe he telling the truth.
GRACIE: Molly...
Let's go to Meeka,
catch a train to Wiluna.
They see us,
they'll catch us.
We can't stop now.
We must keep going.
We're nearly there.
But, Molly...
Mummy there.
She at Wiluna.
I want Mummy.
Come on.
Come on, Daisy.
Come on, Daisy.
You have to carry me, Molly.
Hop on.
[Grunts]
She not coming.
MOLLY: Don't look back.
Don't look back.
She'll come.
DAIS Y: Higher.
You got 'em?
[Giggles]
Three...
one for you, one for me,
and one for both of us.
Mmm.
MOLLY: Come on, Dais.
We gotta go back for Gracie.
[Bird cawing]
[Whispering] Go!
[Indistinct voices
in distance]
[Laughing]
MAN: What are you gonna do,
sell the meat or what?
[Indistinct talking]
[Whistles]
[Insects chirping]
[Bicycle rattles]
- I've got her!
- I want to catch the train!
I want to catch
the train to Mummy!
This one come...
think Mummy's here.
Gracie...
MAN: Hey, grab her!
Hey!
Got you!
[Indistinct conversation]
MAN: Get in that car now.
Thanks, Jacky.
There'll be a shilling for you
back at the station.
Taking you back
where you belong.
DAIS Y: She gone, Molly.
She not coming back.
[Insects chirping]
[Crying softly]
[Wind blows]
Needle in a haystack.
Well, that's it.
Pack your stuff.
We're getting out of here.
They're only paying us
for three weeks.
NEVILLE: To Constable Riggs,
police station, Nullagine...
the two missing half-caste
girls... Molly and Daisy...
are returning to Jigalong
via the rabbit-proof fence,
our efforts to apprehend them
thus far having come to naught.
I therefore expect them
to arrive in Jigalong
in about a month's time.
In your capacity
as local protector,
you are to proceed to Jigalong
to await their arrival
and effect their recapture.
Yours, et cetera.
[Moans softly]
No fence.
I want Mother.
Mmm.
That fence will come back.
[Water sloshes]
[Wind howling]
[Breathing heavily]
[Breathing heavily]
[Woman chanting

[Chanting continues]
[Bird screeches]
[Bird screeches]
[Bird screeches]
[Breathing heavily]
Home.
[Grunts]
MISS THOMAS:
It's coming through now.
"Riggs arrived Jigalong."
"Awaits your instructions."
Yes, there will be a reply.
Please wait.
MAN: "Girls to be sent south
via Meekatharra.
"To be accompanied
at all times.
Awaiting notification."
[Chanting in distance]
What's all that about?
Just some women's business.
Been going on all day.
- Hey, Molly?
- Yeah?
That tracker...
he not gonna get us now?
No, he not gonna get us.
[Chanting in distance]
I'm not gonna stay here.
I can feel it.
[Chanting continues]
They're up to something.
I'm gonna go take a look.
[Chanting intensifies]
[Speaking native language]
[Chanting continues]
[Insects chirping]
[Rustling]
[Riggs breathing heavily]
[Animal screeches]
[Bird screeching]
[lmitates screeching]
[lmitates screeching]
[Panting]
[Giggles]
[Grandmother crying]
I lost one.
[Sniffles]
[Voice breaking]
I lost one.
[Sighs]
NEVILLE: To Constable Riggs,
police station, Nullagine...
at present we lack the funds
to pursue
the missing half-caste girls...
Molly and Daisy.
I would ask
to be kept informed
of their whereabouts
so that at some future date
they may indeed
be... recovered.
We face an uphill battle
with these people...
especially the bush natives...
who have to be protected
against themselves.
If they would
only understand...
what we are trying
to do for them.
[Clicks tongue]
Yours, et cetera.
Thank you.
We walked for nine weeks,
a long way, all the way home.
Then we went straightaway
and hid in the desert.
Got married.
I had two baby girls.
Then they took me and my kids
back to that place, Moore River.
And I walked all the way
back to Jigalong again,
carrying Annabelle,
the little one.
When she was 3,
that Mr. Neville took her away.
I've never seen her again.
Gracie is dead now.
She never made it
back to Jigalong.
Daisy and me, we're here
living in our country, Jigalong.
We're never going back
to that place.
