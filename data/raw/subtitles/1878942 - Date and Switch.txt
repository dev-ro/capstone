Watch this.
That's different.
No, no, no.

Later, motherfuckers!
We'll edit that out.
Still proud.
Whoo!
Can't I just go
see a nice musical

into something gay?
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey, nothing illegal
or unprotected tonight.
Promise?
Dad, that's gross.
I'm talking about sex.
Wrap that rascal.
Make sure you put
a condom on your penis.
Dad.
All right, bye, Dad.
Whoo!
That is a damn
fine shirt you got on.
You like it?
You might go
get a girl pregnant
with a shirt like that on.
I usually take
my shirt off first,
but, you know...
Well, if you meet some
nice girls, party them hard.
I will. See you.
DWAYNE: All right, kiddo.
Go get 'em.

A shake
isn't a sauce, man.
No, see, anything
can be a sauce
if you put it
on something else.
Open up your mind.
See, those are the kinds
of girls we need
to be going out with.
What would you say
to that girl right there
if she came up
to you right now?
Hi. Hello.
You're terrific,
appearance-wise,
and I would like
to take you out
for a food
or beverage situation.
Damn, that's smooth.
Mmm-hmm.
Have you been
working on your game?
Obviously.
It's apparent.
I've been going out
with Ava eight months,
and I feel like
more of a virgin now
than I did before
we started dating
if that's possible.
It is.
You're like
a super-virgin.
You make other virgins
look like huge sluts.
And so do you.
And we need to fix that.
Dude, we are due.
We deserve adult,
mature, grown-up
sexual relationships.
Yes.
What toy did you get?
I got Shelley the Crab.
I got the Punchin'
Crunchin' Robot dudes.
(WHIRRING)
Oh, no! (CHUCKLES)
Take him out.
MICHAEL: Hit him with
the left. Knock him out.
Knock him out!
Boom, boom,
boom, boom!
Ladies.
GIRL: Dorks.
GIRL2: You're such a bitch.
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
I like you a lot.
(CHUCKLES)
Especially your body
and the hotness
of that body.
You're a class act.
Potential wife material.
If we were 45 years old
and all dried up and shit.
And that's the problem.
This relationship's
not progressing
quickly enough,
physically-speaking.
Look at you,
and then look at me.
You're beautiful,
and I'm just
kind of a mess.
Are you breaking up
with me because I won't
have sex with you?
You call it sex.
I call it a physical
expression of our bond.
I haven't
showered in six days.
Like Indians
becoming blood brothers,
or football teammates
getting matching tattoos.
Except sex isn't
even as permanent
as a tattoo.
It's nine minutes,
tops.
In and out
like a cat burglar.
It's just...
That's what I am to you?
A hole for you
to go in and out of?
No, no, no.
I value the person
built around that hole.
I'm really sorry.
(EXHALES)
Okay. I get it.
Are we okay? Yeah?
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Can I get a little
hug going on here?
AVA: You can be
a real asshole,
you know that?
I could get any
fucking guy I want!
I'm so much hotter than you!
Do you even fucking
realize how hot I am?
Not the gummy bears.
Why don't you just
go outside and chill out
for a sec?
Fuck you, Matty.
Why don't you guys
fucking blow each other?
It's the most action
you're ever
gonna get anyway.
How was your breakup?
I can't believe we wasted
so much time with those two.
The high school
chapter of our sexual lives
is rapidly coming to a close.
We need to begin phase two.
We need to get
our dicks wet by prom.
Mmm. I don't approve
of that language at all.
I'm going crazy, dude.
18 years and nothing?
I don't want to wake
up 20 years from now
with regrets.
"Hey, buddy,
sorry I didn't put
you in more things."
Oops.
Whoa!
Man! That is a metric
ton of weed. Shit!
If we eat that whole brownie,
we're gonna immediately
grow dreadlocks.
We should go to cooking
school and learn how
to make real weed cuisine.
I'm talking
leg of lamb with a weed
reduction sauce or some shit.
Dude.
What! I have a genius idea.
We should save this brownie
and eat it as a reward
for getting laid at prom.
Okay. So, it's like our pot
at the end of the rainbow.
Except instead
of a pot full of gold,
it's a pot full of pot.
Yeah, I think that was
implied with what I said.
Dude, I got it
all planned out!
We go to prom,
have sex, eat this brownie,
be high for a week straight.
Then we go to college.
People are gonna be like,
"Those two guys
are so awesome they're
definitely not virgins."
Yeah, then we move back here,
we get dead-end jobs,
we retire,
and we fucking die.
If we time it right,
we make it a double funeral.
Oh, my God.
That's a great plan.
Isn't your dad
going to see this?
Oh, he's a pussycat.
He'll love it.
And he's got
a new girlfriend now,
so he's a happy boy.
All right, man,
I'm gonna head out,
but I will see you tomorrow
at band practice.
All right, dude.
All right.
Hey, you want
to go for a drive?
Um, I was just gonna go
to sleep after finishing
this pair of tits.
(MUMBLES)
We should definitely
go for a drive.
Yo, something
wrong, dude?
No, just going
for a drive.
(SIGHS)
All right, listen, man.
All this talking
we've been doing
about sex, and the future,
and the rest of our
lives and all that shit
has got me feeling
a little guilty.
Why?
Look, you're
my best friend.
You know that.
And so,
I owe this to you.
Yeah, what is it?
I'm a gay dude.
What?
I'm a gay dude.
I'm a gay.
Like "gay" gay?
Like "dicks in butts"
gay or "retarded" gay?
Like, "Man, Nicolas Cage
movies are gay."
No, like "I'm a dude
who's attracted
to other dudes" gay.
What? No, you're
just a dude.
No, exactly.
A gay dude.
Fuck. You're all
out of shape and shit.
Really? No, dude,
I fucking know.
Look, I'm not into curtains.
I've never watched the Tonys.
I'm never gonna wear
a deep V-neck t-shirt,
but I am gay.
When did you first
realize this? Is this
a recent development?
No. Fuck, no.
Remember when we were kids,
six or seven years old,
we used to give that guy
half of our sandwiches
through the chain-link
fence at school?
Yeah, that guy
was a homeless guy.
Yeah, and I kind of
had a crush on him.
You were gay for
the homeless guy?
He was ruggedly handsome.
You wanted to fuck a hobo
when you were seven?
That's what
you're telling me?
That's what
I'm telling you, man.
I wanted to feel the touch
of his dirty, hobo hands.
This is crazy!
You've dated more
girls than I have!
I think that's more
of a you-problem,
to be honest.
Did you tell Em?
Did you tell her
before you told me?
Yeah. Yeah.
Look, dude,
she's super-cool.
I don't want
to fuck up her life with
unnecessary falsehoods.
Wow. Fuck.
You're a gay dude.
Yeah, I'm a gay dude.
Are you sure?
You know what?
Let me think about it
for another 18 years,
and then I'll get back to you.
Yes, I'm fucking
sure, Michael.
All right, man!
Well, shit,
the whole brownie
thing's out the window.
No, I want to eat
that brownie.
I probably wouldn't
have broken up with Ava
without our whole big plan.
She's so hot.
Yeah, and so out
of your league.
Dude, have you seen her boobs
and her stomach area?
Her stomach is almost
as hot as her boobs.
Right? Can you
even wrap your brain
around that?
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's
a tight stomach.
I don't know
what to tell you.
It's nice.
No, no, no. Dude,
this is fine. It's good.
I get it.
You like dicks now.
Yeah.
You are a man who
aspires to handle
the scrotums of other
men in his free time.
Listen, I haven't
got that far.
I don't really know
how I feel about scrotums.
Look, all I know
is that this has
to stay a secret.
Yeah.
I'm not ready for the big,
gay "coming out" shit,
you know what I mean?
Sure, yeah.
And seriously,
you can tell me.
Are we cool?
Yeah, dude. You're my
best friend, man.
Everything's...
It's cool, man.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
MATTY: Hey, man.
I know I dropped a big,
fat, fucking gay bomb
on you tonight.
I don't know
if things ended right
or whatever, but...
Look, dude, I don't want shit
to be awkward or weird.
Not that it would be.
But you should give me a call
when you get this.
(GROANS)
Long, awkward message.
Ahhh! Sorry. Bye.
(SIGHS)
How did they know
that dog is gay?
TERRY: Michael,
you left your backpack...
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.
So, hello, Dad.
How are things?
They're wonderful, son.
How are things with you?
Well. They're well.
Thank you.
Excellent.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm just gonna
set this down now.
Sure. Cool, cool.
MAN IN PORN VIDEO:
Oh, Fuck that cock, yeah.
Is there anything
you'd like
to talk to me about?
No. Nothing at all.
MAN IN PORN VIDEO:
Choke on that horse dick.
Oh, yeah.
Michael, I want you
to know there's nothing
wrong with what
you're doing right now.
I'm not doing what
you think I'm doing.
It's a very natural urge
at your age, a curiosity,
or it could be
more than that.
And if it is,
I'm 100% okay
with that, too.
You don't have to be
okay with anything,
because this
is nothing, really.
Do you want
to talk about it?
No, because this is
just a bunch of research,
nothing more.
Just non-sexual research.
MAN IN PORN VIDEO: I'm living
in your asshole. That asshole
is where my dick lives.
Okay.
When you're ready,
and you want to talk,
I'm here.
I love you, and nothing
can change that.
Remember that.
I'm proud of you.
MAN IN PORN VIDEO:
I'm choking on your cum!
Thanks.
Could you knock
before coming in
here in the future?
Of course.
Stay strong.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
Um, if you need space,
you can put some
stuff in my locker.
Thanks.
There's so much
shit in here.
My dad gave me
a bunch of his old cameras
for a photography class,
but what I didn't tell him
is that for my project,
I'm actually
gonna take pictures
of these cameras
using my phone.
That is so sad
for those cameras.
Yeah. Getting old sucks.
Hey, can I talk
to you about something?
Sure.
So, Matty told me
about the thing.
What thing?
The thing about the gayness
in his "pay-nis."
I don't know why
I said "pay-nis."
That was weird.
Yeah. Well, good.
I'm glad he told you.
He needs people
around him that he can
open up to right now.
People he can trust.
I can be that person.
That's good.
Should I get him
a gift or something?
Balloons or a cake?
Balloons, probably not.
A cake, you should
get him a cake.
And you should have
it say, "You're gay,
and you're fabulous."
Really?
No!
Don't make him
feel weird about it.
You're right.
Nothing has to change.
Are you okay?
Definitely, definitely.
I'm definitely
not feeling weird
about losing my best
friend to the gay side.
It's all good.
Gonna keep on trucking.
We're a couple
of knuckleheads.
Take it to the bank, sister.
Think about that.
Matty, you're in a band?
Really?
Oh, yeah, it's an instrumental
TV theme song cover band.
But we don't want
to put a label on it.
Smart.
Don't let the man
tell you who you are.
Did you ever
think about adding
the popular part of music,
the singing?
Well, yeah.
A little tip. It might
help you in the audition.
Good to know.
Michael,
do you need a pen?
No, I'm with him.
Oh. Are you really?
Because you weren't
yesterday at practice
when we needed you.
I called you seven times.
And everyone's like,
"Where's Michael?"
and I'm like...
Can I just talk
to you for a second?
Sure.
I'll turn
the volume up on this
so we can talk
without anyone hearing.
So, you punched
the brownie?
That's not like you at all.
You love baked goods.
I'm not gonna
lie to you, man.
You being gay
all of a sudden,
without warning,
I was a little
mad and confused.
But I thought
about the whole thing.
I've really thought about it,
and it's cool,
seriously.
I even stayed up
and fixed the brownie.
I did major
structural repairs.
That's awesome, man.
Thanks.
It looks even
better than before.
I frosted some
dicks and butts on it
in your honor.
Dicks and butts? (GASPS)
You're a great friend.
I'm on board.
I want to go on this
gay journey with you.
You're my best friend.
Nothing has to change.
We're still on a mission.
We need to get each
other laid by prom.
All right.
We need to get
these dicks wet, bro!
Or whatever you
call it with gay guys.
Get shit on your dick?
Get shitty-dicked?
Yeah, there's probably
a better term for it.
So, we're doing this, man!
I'm gonna get you laid!
You're in, right?
I'm in.
There's a lot
of fish in the sea.
Lady fish and dude fish,
straight fish and gay fish.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
High school dudes
are weird.
Yeah, not great.
Holy shit,
this is it,
the mother lode.
MATTY: Oh, dude,
theater kids?
No, I don't think
I should talk
to them right now.
You have to put
your ass out there
if you want to get
something put in it.
Dude, I just came
out to you.
Do I have to go talk
to other gay
people immediately?
That's what friends do.
Friends wingman each other.
And I hate that word.
I think it's stupid,
but it's what I'm gonna
do to you, whether
you like it or not.
It's not that I
don't appreciate it.
It's just that I
think that we should...
This is
an American tradition.
Having sex
by prom is a story told
over and over again
by our greatest writers.
Huck Finn, Moby Dick,
Ulysses, the  Iliad.
They're all about
having sex by prom.
No, I don't think
they are.
But it feels
like they are.
What about you, man?
You're nowhere near having sex
with anything anytime soon.
I'm pretty sure
I can still hook
it up with Ava.
Fuck! That guy?
Come on.
One of us is gonna make
some progress today.
Reflections, the center
of Glen Ellen's gay universe.
It's good to be
back at a bar.
Did you know that
this is one of my top
five favorite bars?
Yeah, it is.
Oh. Thank you.
Cool, cool, cool.
This is the only
bar in town
that doesn't care how
shitty our fake IDs are.
Dude, this is great.
Okay.
No wonder
they let us in.
Dude, this is bad.
This is really bad.
This is a more
depressing version
of a regular bar.
That guy over there
looks like he's
having a great time.
Come on, come on.
Hey, guys.
How's it going?
Hey, guys.
Are you guys new guys?
You're probably new guys.
Everyone around
here is a regular.
I'd recognize you
if you weren't new.
Yeah. This is Matty.
I'm Michael. He's gay.
I'm not.
I'm Jared,
and I'm very gay.
Yeah, we noticed.
Do you guys go
to Glen Ellen?
It's cool.
I go to Valley Springs.
Go Panthers!
But I know the scene there,
and you guys totally
seem like GHS kids.
Boo Huskies.
Yeah, we go
to Glen Ellen.
Awesome.
So, do you
wanna fuck later?
Holy shit.
Dude, that guy
is ready to fuck right now.
What's wrong?
He has a ring in his eyebrow
and glitter on his everything.
So?
He was too gay.
Don't be homophobic, bro.
Come on, what's your type?
My type? I don't know.
I don't think I have a type.
Of course you do.
Everyone has a type.
What is it?
Look,
we should just chill out,
have a beer, relax.
Can we do that, please?
Yeah.
Hi again!
Hi.
Hey, Jared, it's gonna be
a no for the fucking.
Shh.
I'm gonna get some E.
Do you want some E?
You're gonna want some E.
No, we don't want
any ecstasy.
I'll get you some E,
and then we'll talk.
Whoo!
E for enthusiasm.
Certainly.
This is useless.
You're super-lucky.
When you're gay,
you get nonstop
sex all the time.
No strings attached.
It's amazing.
I'm not gonna just
have sex with anyone
because I'm gay.
I'm gay.
I'm not a whore.
I'm back
with your ecstasy,
boys!
Jared,
we were very specific.
We don't want it.
Have you even
tried it before?
Oh, my God! Uh-oh.
You're really good
at dancing.
I don't think
I'm dancing.
Jared! Get out of here.
Leave those guys alone.
Mr. Vernon? You're here.
Yeah, so are you.
We're all here.
Chris, you remember
Michael and Matty
from school?
Hey, guys.
Mr. Dennis.
You used to be
in my fourth period.
You gave me a C.
So, you're not
gonna talk about this
to anyone?
Oh, no, of course not.
Though I think
it'd be a good idea
if you guys went home.
I can't really talk
to you while you're
underage drinking.
Of course.
Yeah.
And it would be
nice to keep this quiet
on both ends,
if that makes sense.
Totally understand.
Yeah.
I really look
forward to not making
eye contact with you
tomorrow at school.
Dude, Mr. Vernon.
I had no idea.
Yeah, and Mr. Dennis.
You think they've
done it at school?
Come on, man.
By the way,
I appreciate the sentiment,
but this is
the worst and only gay bar
I've ever been to.
(CAR HONKS)
(THUDS)
Fuck!
What the F?
GREG: Fuck a duck.
Oh, shit.
MICHAEL:
What were you doing?
I'm driving, man.
It's not my fault
that you drive the smallest
car in the universe.
What is that?
Is that a Diet Kia?
You could have
really injured us.
Ha-ha-ho! Ho-ho.
You just said "could have."
You've officially acknowledged
that no harm has been done.
Okay.
This thing is trashed.
I'm gonna need a new thing.
Look at this!
This is the time
when we get our
insurance information.
Um... Uh-uh-uh...
No. I'm gonna go
ahead and leave now.
Okay?
Dude. Come on!
What the fuck?
Yo!
Hey! Stop!
You're not gonna
run me over.
Be cool.
Let's talk.
Chill, man.
I'm totally chill.
Super chill.
I'm very cool.
You smell
like an old tent.
What's wrong with you?
Honestly, I have
a Baconator in the car,
and I want to get
home and eat it.
What the fuck
is a Baconator?
It's a really
delicious sandwich
from Wendy's.
Dude, just give me
your information.
Mike, maybe
we should just
call the cops.
We can't call the cops.
We're underage,
and we had a bunch of beers.
Did you just push me?
Maybe.
Okay. Then it's
gonna be go time.
It's okay. It's just...
(GRUNTING)
What was that, dude?
You tripped me?
GREG: Yeah, I did.
You tripped me?
Who the fuck trips people?
I do. I took a vow
recently that I would
stop punching people,
because I was
doing that too much.
I'm trying to be
less violent in general.
So, okay.
He did trip you
really well.
I know, dude,
but whose side are you on?
(ENGINE STARTS)
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
All right!
Dude, that was
actually pretty dope.
I think we're ready.
I think that's
the audition song.
Yeah, yeah. Well,
Mike, we've actually
been having some
discussions about
the direction of the band.
What does that mean?
Well, we've been talking,
and we think it's
about time we add
some songs
with vocals
to the set list.
Like Cheers and
Charles in Charge.
Saved by the Bell,
Saved by the Bell:
College Years.
Yeah, the list
goes on and on.
And more importantly,
Mr. Vernon
straight-up told me,
"You're not playing prom
unless you have a singer."
Yeah, well, that's not
what we are. That's
not what we do.
Who would even sing?
You would.
What? No, I can't.
You have
a beautiful voice, man.
You were the star
of that musical
in third grade.
Thank you.
But no. No way.
(STUTTERS)
I'm not gonna sing
in front of people.
Why do we have
to change up things?
Everything's fine
the way it is right now.
(CAR ENGINE STOPS)
(CAR DOORS CLOSE)
Hey, fags.
Shit.
It's your brother.
Time's up.
Get out of the garage.
It's not 5:00 yet,
Lars.
Yeah, well,
we're starting early.
Really gotta nail down
this Daughtry medley.
Oh, that's a medley?
I thought that was
one incredibly long,
incredibly shitty song.
Nice try, Matty.
But you can't rile me up.
We're so focused
and tight right now,
me, Brandon and Chad.
I'm Mark.
You're 30 years old,
and you play
in a band with
high school kids.
And our band rules!
Now, get the fuck
out of the garage
so we can practice.
Fine.
LARS: Come on, guys.
I'm gonna show you
my lizards.
All right,
Mikey, I have compiled
a list of songs
that have vocals.
I want you
to learn the lyrics.
And next time we're in here,
we'll just rock them out.
Okay, so, this club
is called Club Monsoon,
and looks like
it's on the east side.
Am I gonna end up
with a glow stick
up my ass?
Yes, but the man
holding that glow stick
just might be
your future husband.
Hello. Welcome to
Club Monsoon.
For two?
Yep.
Glow sticks.
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
Don't these guys know
they're living a cliche?
How are you
supposed to meet
anybody in here?
I think you just
dance with them
until their dick
accidentally slips
inside of you.
All right. Excuse me.
Sir, a little bit of space.
A little bit more space.
Okay. All right.
My fault
for being here.
Two mojitos, please.
Oh. Can we hit that?
It's not what
you think it is.
That isn't some
of that dank Kush?
No, it's salvia.
It gives you
the best dream
of your life
for 15 minutes,
and then it's over.
Is it safe?
Well, it's legal.
Whoa! You guys gotta be
in your underwear
to be in the foam room.
No shirt,
no shoes, no pants.
That's our policy.
Shirt?
I'm not even
wearing a face.
(PEOPLE CHEER)
Above and beyond,
gentlemen.
(CLUB MUSIC PLAYING)
MICHAEL: It's a waterfall!
(LAUGHS)
This is the
best waterfall
I've ever seen!
Yeah! You guys are
such good dancers!
Music is shooting
out of his body.
It's magical.
(ALL CHEERING)
Hey, hey.
What if there were
no clocks ever?
What would you
do with your day
if there were no
clocks or no time?
Build a clock.
Jared!
(LAUGHING)
Okay!
Somebody's not
wearing panties tonight!
(ALL CHEERING)
MATTY: This is the best
night of my life! Whoo!
It's fun.
It was fun, right?
Not too bad.
Not bad at all.
Just hanging out in there.
Just doing stuff.
Not that different
from what we usually do.
What are you talking about?
We were dancing naked
with a bunch of dudes
in a room full of foam.
It's like that one time
when I made us
take tango lessons
because it would
help us meet girls.
No, it's not.
This is completely different.
This is completely
different than anything
we've ever done
in our lives ever.
At least we're still
doing it together.
But, dude, is this my future?
A bunch of trips
to Club Monsoon?
Is that so bad?
They had cool furniture
and lights and stuff.
It's like Europe in there.
Not all of Europe is gay.
Whatever. Dude,
the important thing is,
we're still friends.
We got the brownie,
all that stuff.
Everything is better
with lasers
and smoke machines.
You love lasers.
You love smoke.
That was a paradise for you.
Am I wrong? I know you.
I know you
better than anyone.
That was amazing.
It was like Europe.
Plus also,
in the future, and also,
it's a horror movie.
What are you doing?
I got locked out
of my house.
(CHUCKLES)
Can I come in?
She was just texting
on her phone throughout
the entire movie,
and I was so mad,
I was just throwing
popcorn in her face
without even realizing it.
You haven't been listening
to anything I've been saying,
have you?
No, yeah, I am.
Wait a minute.
Are you high?
No.
You totally are. I can
tell. You're never this
quiet for this long.
Yeah. I smoked
salvia tonight.
Holy shit. Is it awesome?
No.
You seem kind of
traumatized.
It's okay.
You don't have to tell
me about it right now.
You can tell me about it
whenever you want, really.
You can talk
to me about anything
whenever you want.
You're patting me
on the head like a dog.
I am doing that.
I'm sorry.
Wait. You are drunk!
Yeah.
I knew it!
You're all
chatty and shit.
I killed a bunch
of my dad's bourbon.
Nice.
And then you came over.
And now we're here
with cheese and bread.
You, me, cheese,
bread here.
(CHUCKLES)
Life sucks.
Yeah, life sucks.
But I guess
sometimes it doesn't.
Wait, wait, wait.
What are we doing?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Oh, hey.
Ahhh.
I should go.
Yeah, you should.
Yeah.
My clothes are over there.
So can you turn around?
Okay.
Should we talk
about what
happened last night?
We were fucked up.
We are, in general,
fucked up.
If it had to be with a girl,
I'm glad it was with you.
Thank you?
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah.
Bye.
Reading? I love books.
Books are
like word movies.
What do you want,
Michael?
Nothing. Just two friends
hanging out, talking,
swapping stories.
You just spit on me.
Did I?
Sorry. Sometimes that
happens when I start
talking too fast.
I think some
of it got in my mouth.
Do you wanna go
to prom with me?
What? No.
Okay, I know I dumped
you, and that was
probably painful,
but I realized
that was a mistake,
and I think we
can get past that.
I'm going with Anthony.
Really?
Or Lucas or Damien.
There's a lot of balls
in the air right now.
There are?
What happened?
I'm dating around.
Dating around?
You don't date around.
That's not... (STUTTERS)
We didn't even
get past third base.
We never got past second.
It's an imprecise
metaphorical system.
It's open to interpretation.
You just spit
on me again.
Sorry.
I have to go.
I'm late for color guard.
You can't guard colors.
It's a stupid name.
It should be
called flag spinning.
Hey, welcome to
Catch-a-Burger. Those are
sweet cargo shorts.
Thank you.
Can I take your order?
My name is Pete.
Yes, I would like a
Bacon Symphony and
a large order of fries.
Okay. $5.66.
Here you go.
And can I give
your change
to the Catch-a-Burger
Courageous Kids program?
No, thank you.
I'll just take the change.
I guess you can't
afford the 34 cents?
Or you wanted
to put it to better use
than giving it
to courageous kids?
Yeah, I'll give my money
to the kids' program. Sure.
For an additional
two dollars,
I can make you
a Catch-a-Burger
Courageous Kids Ambassador.
Thank you,
but I would just
like to eat my food.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, do you have parents?
Yeah, of course.
Everyone has parents.
Not the Catch-a-Burger
Courageous Kids.
They're orphans, man.
That's what makes
them so courageous.
It's two dollars?
It's two dollars.
Yeah, I have two dollars.
Thanks so much.
Just put it in the box.
Fill out one
of those guys for me.
Can I order while
he's doing this?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, you know what
would be really cool?
If you would do
what he's doing
preemptively.
It's just two bucks.
Really help a lot of kids.
I haven't
ordered yet.
Big man here is doing it,
and he looks like he
has fucking no money.
Okay, let's do it.
Thanks, bro.
I met you
at the place before.
Yes,
I struck you
with my truck.
Hey, do you guys
have little brothers?
I have an older brother.
No, I'm talking
about the Big Brother
Big Sister program.
You guys are
the right age for it.
I've been doing
it for three years,
and it has been
the best experience
of my whole life.
It really changed me.
I gotta tell you
about my little brother,
Phiram.
He's from Cambodia.
He came over here on a boat
when he was a baby.
He lost his father
when he was two.
Now he plays
the fucking cello, man.
(EXHALES)
Imagine that!
That guy's incredible.
That guy's like a drug dealer
for the concept of charity.
Um, I think I owe you
an apology for my behavior
the other night.
I was not
in a good place.
I'd just taken
my dog to the vet
because he ate
an entire soccer ball.
Oh, man.
Well, I'm sorry, too.
My buddy gets
really nervous sometimes.
Or all the time.
I'm very intimidating.
Yeah, I'm by far
the toughest guy
you're ever
gonna meet outside
Reflections, okay?
Right here. All right.
You like that place?
You like that scene?
It was interesting. Yeah.
It was my first
time there.
Is that a place
that you often are
around or inside of?
Well,
it's not much
on ambience,
but they do have
this one incredible craft
beer that you gotta try.
It's not to be missed.
It's called Bud Light.
It's so good.
I'm Greg.
I'm Matty.
Nice to meet you.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Nice to meet you.
PETE: Let me tell you
about my little brother,
Phiram.
Do you wanna watch
this happen one more time?
Yes.
Okay.
Em! Em!
Hey.
Can you do me
a huge favor?
What?
I need a ride.
Thanks for driving
me to the shop.
No problem.
I got in an accident
the day I got my license,
and my parents
totally freaked out,
so I know what it's like.
How many accidents
have you been in?
Five or six.
Wait, seriously?
Should I be
driving with you?
Shit, I got a text.
Hold on.
No, no, no!
(LAUGHS)
I'm kidding.
I've only been in four.
Watch the road, please!
(CHUCKLES)
Hey, have you
talked to Matty recently?
No.
He's been acting
really weird.
Really?
Yeah. I mean,
I know it's not an easy time,
but... I don't know.
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
No English?
Can you...
The bumper,
bumpero, is no good.
It needs changing.
Come back.
You can't just do this.
My bumper is messed up.
Does anyone
here speak English?
EM: What's going on?
I'm screwed.
No one here
speaks any English.
So you're just
gonna drive around
with a big, old, red bumper
on your little periwinkle car?
It's gunmetal.
And it might not be so
bad if I drive at night.
No, they messed up your car.
That's unacceptable.
Excuse me.
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
You don't have to...
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Don't yell at him.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Thank you.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
(CROWD CHEERING)
This shit is so much better
than that American shit.
These guys are Mexican.
They are hard-core.
Who's this guy?
That is the Super Gato.
He's a man/cat thing.
MATTY: Shit.
His thing is when
he beats somebody,
he pours milk on them,
and then he licks it off.
He calls it
"licking the leche."
No, I'm not into that.
It's not okay.
It's weird.
What about this
gentleman right here?
Yeah! Yeah!
That's El Cientifico Loco,
the Mad Scientist.
He's my favorite.
He's the Mexican version
of Stephen Hawking.
He rolls around
the ring in his little chair,
acting like a bitch,
and then he gets bullied.
He just rises up
and regulates.
It's awesome.
Dude, how are you
a gay guy?
I don't know.
I just am.
How are you
a gay guy?
I don't know, man.
This is fun.
It's a good time.
Yeah.
I enjoy hanging
out with you, man.
You're a good friend-type
dude-person thing.
Thank you, Matt.
Yes.
It's easy to get a quick lay,
but the friendship part
is hard to come by.
Yeah! Yeah!
That's it!
Fuck him up!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Oh, shit!
Yeah!
That's a pin!
Fuck, yeah!
Fuck you, cat!
Here comes
the robot voice.
What?
Here comes the robot voice.
Just hold on.
Hold on. And...
EL CIENTIFICO
LOCO'S ROBOT VOICE:
Soy el campeon.
Yes, you are el campeon!
Yeah, you are el campeon!
Oh, shit!
Bring it in right here!
Yeah,
I shouldn't have
had a drink.
I shouldn't have
had a drink.
Meet me
in the parking lot!
Yeah. You got it, man.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Whoa!
What is that?
That is your mom's
anniversary gift.
Another reminder that I
got life by the balls.
Check it out.
Is that one
of those rotisserie grills?
No, it is the Ronco
Showtime Rotisserie.
I nailed it.
She is gonna love it.
You know why?
Women love kitchen stuff.
As much as we like
to deny it in this PC day
and age, it's just true.
Men like cars.
Men like trucks.
This is like
a truck to her.
Oh, I thought
I heard voices...
Oh, my God.
No, you did not.
Oh, I did.
Is that
the Ronco Showtime?
Yes, ma'am.
"Set it and forget it"?
"Set it and forget it."
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God!
Daddy, you are so
thoughtful. Come here.
(CHUCKLES)
I am gonna make
the best chicken for you.
That skin
is gonna be so crispy.
I love crispy skin!
It is going to be
the crispiest skin
of any chicky.
Oh, my gosh!
I'm just so excited.
I'm gonna go print
out my internet recipes
right this second.
All right.
PATRICIA: Matty, your father
is something else.
Okay.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
Hey, Matty.
What have you been up to?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Last couple of days,
I haven't seen you.
What have you been doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out
at home and stuff.
Why are you
being so weird?
I'm not being weird.
You have
an intense crazy-guy look
in your eyes right now.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll see you
at practice. I gotta run.
Where do you
have to run?
I'm gonna assume
you're joking right now.
You're hilarious.
And then... (SCATTING)
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
You're late.
Yeah, sorry, guys.
You pumped to sing?
Actually,
I might still
need more time.
We don't have
very much time, Mike.
I mean,
the audition's
in a few days.
I'm having trouble
with these lyrics.
Dude, it's
the Golden Girls
theme song.
Everyone knows the lyrics
to the Golden Girls
theme song.
That shit's iconic.
Ready, Josh? Let's go.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(SCATTING)
♪ Thank you for
being a friend ♪
Sing a little louder,
Mike.
♪ Traveled down
the road and back again ♪
Can't hear you!
Can't hear shit!
Dude, it's just singing.
Come on, Mike.
No, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop.
(MUSIC STOPS)
Look, this is not
what we are.
We are an instrumental
TV theme song cover band.
Yeah, we were
until now.
I wanna play prom, Michael.
I wanna play this song,
and I wanna fuck some
chicks because of it.
My fucking is directly
linked to your singing.
Dude, let's just do
what we usually do.
There's no way we're
gonna win if we don't do
the Golden Girls theme song!
Now, we're all
in agreement,
right, guys?
Fucking A.
Yeah.
MATTY: There you go.
Maybe then we just
shouldn't do it at all.
MATTY: What are you...
Are you seriously
doing this right now?
Yep, you can't force me
to sing. I'm not a singer.
Jesus, man,
grow some fucking balls!
I am!
These are my balls.
Me leaving.
Those are my balls.
And then I wouldn't sing,
and they were being dicks.
And we're not even
gonna audition now,
and it just sucks.
You had a vision.
You stuck to your guns.
My entire life is shit.
You know I asked
Ava to prom?
No!
Yep.
No.
Yep.
She is no longer
interested, Michael.
I know that.
I never should have
broken up with her.
She's got
the face of an angel,
the body of an angel.
She's like an angel
that you really
wanna have sex with.
Yeah, I wouldn't feel
that bad. She's not
really an angel.
Yeah, she is.
I'm gonna tell
you something
because I want
you to feel like
you can just
really get over her.
Okay?
Okay.
Ava was hooking up
with Anthony before
you broke up with her.
What?
She was cheating on you.
Damn it. Damn it.
Well, at least
she's super-uptight,
and she won't
let anyone get past
second base.
Yeah, she wasn't that
uptight with Anthony.
What, did she
have sex with him?
I'm sorry.
No, thanks for telling me.
They also had anal sex.
What?
No, I'm just kidding.
I just thought that would
make you feel better about
the regular-sex thing.
(SIGHS)
Wow, that actually
kind of worked.
You're welcome. Yeah.
I'm never gonna
touch another girl
again, am I?
Here we go.
I am so mediocre.
You're not that mediocre.
(CHUCKLES)
You're gonna be fine.
Ava's my friend,
I think.
But even when you
guys were going out,
I don't think she
ever really appreciated
what she had with you
as much as someone
who you deserve
even better, I think.
Thank you.
I mean it.
You wanna go
for a drive?
Okay.
MICHAEL: I can't believe
we go to the same place.
What do you mean?
I've been going
there since I was a kid.
Well, it's just boys go
to barbers, and girls
go to stylists.
Really?
That's how barbering works.
Does my hair
really look that bad?
No! It looks great.
It's lustrous,
like a horse's mane.
Thanks.
In a good way.
I just didn't know
that Giovanni
had this ability.
He's, like,
100 years old.
Giovanni is the best,
and I'm proud to be
his only female client.
Okay? So, here.
Imaginary cheers
to Giovanni.
To Giovanni.
Clink!
(INAUDIBLE SPEECH)
(CHUCKLES)
He's here.
What?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm making out with a dude.
What does it
look like I'm doing?
MICHAEL: Wait.
Why do you have
to do gay stuff
with the asshole
who hit my car?
He's actually
a really good guy.
That was a really
rough night for me.
I'm sorry.
And what are you
doing here with
my ex-girlfriend?
That's a little bit weird.
Hi.
Hey! I'm Greg.
I'm Em.
It's not a thing.
We're just having
a chit-chat here.
Two friends talking.
What's the big deal?
And what does it
even matter
if you're gay anyway?
Um, it's the
principle of it.
Is this why you've
been avoiding me?
You've been hanging out
a lot with gay-ass Greg?
Maybe not "gay-ass Greg."
Maybe just "gay Greg."
Or even "Greg."
Yeah, dude.
Actually, we have been
hanging out quite a bit.
And to be 100% honest,
you've been so fucking
weird about all this shit
that I don't know
if I wanna hang out
with you 24/7 anymore.
Look, man.
Deal with your
own shit for once.
Take control of your life
and stop focusing
so much on mine.
I'm starting
to miss straight Matty.
Straight Matty never
would have snuck
around behind my back.
Wake up. I was never straight.
I don't need this
pressure from you, man.
I don't need
to get laid by prom
or any of that shit.
What about the brownie?
I don't wanna eat
your shitty brownie.
Don't talk about
the brownie like that.
Bro, seriously,
chill out
about the brownie.

LARS: Moments in Memory
forever!
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yeah?
We got a new DVD
in the mail today.
TV show called The L Word.
I thought maybe
we could watch
it together.
Uh, yeah, maybe later.
I'm gonna go skate right now.
I have some
stuff to think about.
Let me know if you
ever wanna talk more.
Or if you wanna talk less.
I don't want
to smother you.
You're not.
Well, good.
I know life seems
complicated sometimes.
But I usually
find it gets simpler
if you just
focus on the things
that have always
made you happy.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Yo.
Yeah!
MATTY: Hey, man!
MICHAEL: Thanks
for coming.
MATTY: Of course, man.
What's up?
What made you think of coming
here in the first place?
MICHAEL: Go-karts.
We love go-karts.
True.
I always find that
things get simpler
if you just focus
on things that have
always made you happy.
Oh. Cool, cool.
When was the last
time we came here?
Six years ago?
Yeah.
What did the guy
used to say?
He used to kick us out,
and then he used
to say something.
"What did I tell
you about bumping?
No bumping, man!"
"If you come back here,
I'm gonna call the cops!"
Ahhh.
It's the same guy.
Oh, fuck!
You think he would
have moved on by now.
MATTY: You think
he remembers us?
MICHAEL: No way, dude.
We were 12 when
he last saw us.
Hey. Two, please.
Go sit in there.
It's where I do the safety
instruction seminar.
What exactly can you do
to avoid being
brutally mutilated
on the race track today?
That's a dark way
to start the session.
I've seen these things
crush people's feet.
I've seen them tear
off people's fingers.
I once saw a little
girl get her hair stuck
in the motor.
(SCREAMING)
Bye-bye, scalp.
Does it have
to do with bumping?
No bumping!
Bumping is a one-way ticket
to injury land USA.
And if the karts
don't injure you, I will.
I will come out there
and punch you in the face
so you don't injure
any of our other drivers.
That's how much I care
about the rest of you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get this straight.
We should or we
shouldn't bump?
Looks like we got
ourselves a comedian.
Let me ask you this,
Mr. Comedian.
Is this hilarious?
It's kind of funny.
Go-kart accident!
Stuttgart, Germany! 2007.
It doesn't even
look like a real leg.
It's not real.
It's a mock-up that
I made because no one
took photos that day.
Makes sense.
Bump once,
I kick you the F out.
You bump twice,
what happens?
Trick question.
You can't bump twice,
because if you bump once,
I've already
kicked your ass out.
And you're at home
sitting on your couch alone,
watching the Food Network,
wishing you hadn't bumped.
(CHEERS)
Hey!
Keep your hands
on the wheel!
(SCREAMS)
Put your legs
back in the kart!
It's your last warning!
Get over here!
Why, hello, old friend!
Would you like to partake
in some light
bumping this afternoon?
I would say
that we should
definitely do that.
Okay, then we should bump!
I'm gonna bump
the shit out of you!
You're dead, bro!
MATTY: Shit!
No bumping! No bumping!
(LAUGHING)
I remember you motherfuckers!
You used to bump
more than anyone!
I told you never
to come back here.
You're dead!
MATTY: Fuck!
(PANTING)
Why didn't we
just run to our cars?
I don't know.
I just panicked.
Yeah, me, too.
He was fucking pissed!
Yeah.
He was more
pissed than I've ever
seen him before,
and that's saying a lot.
I don't think
we can go back there
for 10 years.
No way. (CHUCKLES)
Dude, I'm sorry about
saying all that stuff,
wishing you were
straight and all that.
Oh. It's okay, man.
I'm sorry that I said
your brownie was shitty.
Oh, I know it's not.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
It's actually still in
the freezer by the way.
You think this
Greg guy is the one?
He could be your brownie guy.
Man, I don't know.
Have you
touched his balls yet?
Oh, come on.
What? You like balls.
You're a ball guy.
I never said that.
You said that.
I think you made
that up actually.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I did do that.
What about you, man?
What have you
got going on?
Me?
I actually got someone
I'm thinking about.
Nice!
You're over Em, right?
Dude.
What?
Seriously?
What, dude?
You're seriously
gonna do this?
You're gonna call dibs
on her even after you've
broken up with her,
and you're not into persons
with her sexual organs?
No, I'm not calling dibs.
I feel like it's weird.
Tell me it's not weird.
It's not weird.
It's not weird.
I think it's
a little weird.
All right.
I'm gonna go.
I'm supposed to meet up
with Greg in a little bit.
But this was super-fun.
Good to see you, man.
Great to see you, man.
What if I call
dibs on Greg?
Mmm.
That makes no sense.
No. I'll see you
later, brother.
All right.
Actually, I'm parked
over there, too.
Yeah, that's happening.
MICHAEL: So she's
not an angel.
Okay, let's go.
Yep.
Thanks for hanging out
with me and dealing
with my shit recently.
It's been fun.
Yeah,
it's been fun
for me, too.
Why is this the only spot
that people drive up to?
Because it's Glen Ellen.
This abandoned
construction lot
is the most romantic
place in town.
So you brought us here
because it's romantic?
Oh, yes, I did. I did.
Those beautiful porta-potties,
and the broken glass,
and used condoms
really just get me
right in the mood.
(CHUCKLES) That's good.
Wait, Michael,
I need to tell you
something.
What?
After Matty and I broke up,
we hooked up one more time.
When?
After you guys
went to that club.
And we...
We had sex.
What?
Yeah.
You what? (STUTTERS)
Yeah, I know.
I was drunk,
and we both had
really weird nights.
How can that happen?
It just did.
He's gay. He's gay.
Well, you're not
the only one in the world
with confused feelings,
Michael.
I'm not confused.
I definitely wouldn't
have sex with a gay guy.
Okay, now,
you're just
being an asshole.
You're an asshole.
(SIGHS) I can't do this.
Michael...
Michael!
(GRUNTING)
Shit.
(DOOR BELL RINGS)
Oh, hey, Michael.
Oh, is Matty home?
Yeah, he sure is.
We're just getting ready
to sit down to dinner.
You want to join us?
Yes, I would.
Okay, great.
Well, come on in.
What have you got there?
This is a private thing.
Oh. Mmm.
LARS: Mom, this
chicken is incredible.
This skin is so...
Crispy?
Crispy!
You're damn right it is.
(CHUCKLES)
That is the Ronco
Showtime Rotisserie
doing its thing.
It's just fucking great.
Lars. Language, please.
Oh. This is a great meal.
(CHUCKLES)
DWAYNE: And all because
of a great gift.
(MOUTHING) Are you okay?
(MOUTHING) I hate you.
Why don't we thank your mother
by going around the table
and saying
what our favorite
part of the meal is?
I'll go first.
The chicken.
But more specifically,
the skin.
How did I know you
were going to say that?
Lars?
Skin.
Matty?
Yeah, skin.
Pat?
(LAUGHS)
Michael?
My favorite part of this meal
is how Matty fucked a girl!
(LAUGHS)
Michael, language.
Well, that's not really
the answer to the question.
I am kind of curious.
Is that true, Matty?
I'm sorry.
Can I please be excused
to speak with Michael
in the other room?
Well, we are
having a family dinner.
Why don't you let
them talk it out?
(WHISPERS) Dwayne. Dwayne.
Ask him.
Dude, what the fuck?
You had sex with Em.
So what?
So I like her a lot.
She was my girlfriend.
You're gay.
Shh! Shut up!
You don't deserve her.
You don't deserve any girl.
Why did you do that?
Why are you even
at my house? What the fuck
are you doing here?
You're gay.
I need you to shut up
for the rest of dinner.
Can you please
just do that for me?
LARS: What?
You don't like that movie?
I don't believe it.
DWAYNE: When you're married,
I'll let you know what that...
Hi, Matty.
Welcome back.
DWAYNE: Okay, boys.
Family meal.
Anything going
on with you two?
Yeah, a lot, actually.
Today was
a crazy day at PacSun.
We got these huge
new shipments in.
I had tons and tons
of board shorts.
So I took a look
at the different styles,
and I said to Laurie,
I said, "Laurie, I will
sell all of these lace-up
board shorts today.
"Not this week, today."
And she was like,
"Yeah, right, Lars! No way."
And by the end of the day,
get this, Dad.
(MOUTHING) What are you doing?
(MOUTHING) I hate you.
(MOUTHING) Stop!
LARS: I sold all
of the lace-ups and some
of the non-lace-ups.
So I was like,
"Suck it, Laurie!"
(LAUGHS)
PATRICIA: That's fantastic.
DWAYNE: Great work, son.
Very ambitious,
just like your dad.
LARS: I got something
else that I really want to
share with you guys.
First off, I wanna thank you
for keeping me so
humble on this journey.
I know it's been tough,
but something
really great
happened to me today.
(MOUTHING) You're gay.
(MOUTHING) You are an asshole.
I just found out my band,
we're playing the prom!
Matty's gay!
That's great!
Congratulations!
Daddy.
Wait.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Matty's gay.
Shut the fuck up, Michael.
Language.
What is he talking about?
Matty's a gay guy.
You have a gay son.
Language.
Gay is not a bad word.
It's debatable.
All right, everyone
just cut the bullshit!
What is going on?
It's a milestone
in my musical career, Dad,
is what's going on!
Matthew...
Matty, is this true?
No!
Matthew, answer your mother.
I said no!
He's not gay.
DWAYNE: No.
All right, why don't
you excuse yourself
to your room, and
I will meet you there.
Michael, this
dinner is over right now.
Fine.
Seriously?
DWAYNE: You heard me.
It's gonna be awesome.
I know it's a prom,
but I think
I can get you two in.
(GROANS)
Did you out Matty
to his parents?
Hold on.
Did you tell
them that he's gay?
It's complicated.
Did you think for a second
about what that meant to him?
Let me explain!
Do you have any idea
what's happening
to him right now?
Wait!
He was your best
friend, Michael!
Your best friend!
You are a terrible person.
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
Oh!
Damn, dude!
This looks good, right?
It is perfect.
I think we're good to go.
Cool.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
This is totally
not my business,
but I thought you
really liked that guy.
Yeah,
I just can't do
that anymore.
Him specifically or...
Just all of it.
Matthew, we found
the most darling cufflinks.
They're little pigs.
Why would I
want those, Mom?
I'm sorry.
I gave you the wrong jacket.
Let me get you the right one.
Oh. Get this off.
It's two sizes too small.
Silly. (CHUCKLES)
There we go.
Uh-oh.
Yes, yes, yes.
Now you look
good enough to eat.
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)
Yes. Very handsome.
Oh. Matthew, this reminds
me of your dad when
we went to our prom.
You went to the prom
with your husband, and
you're still together?
We sure are. 32 years.
Congratulations!
I wish I could say the
same, but old Linda
is still playing the field.
Oh. That's okay. It's fun
being single. Live it up!
Oh. Thirty-two years.
Wow. Maybe you can
give me some advice.
I'm dating a Colombian man.
We have very little in common.
We hardly understand
each other, but the sex
is really amazing.
He's only willing
to see me on Tuesdays.
Now, what is that about?
Might be a cultural thing.
Then there's Gene.
Gene's very bright.
He's got a skin condition,
but that's not
a deal-breaker for me.
And the sex is ridiculous!
Oh. What do I do?
High school prom,
we're getting fitted for.
Then there's Claude.
He's 5'6'',
he owns a sailboat,
and he's my mailman.
The sex is amazing!
But only on the sailboat.
When it's rocky.
But I think that's because
Claude is a little lazy.
What do I do?
I'm not even really sure
what we're talking
about at this point.
You're not kidding.
Relationships are hard.
They are complicated.
Although, you two kids
seem to have it
figured out, right?
You look so
cute together.
Yes, we do. We got it
all figured out.
LINDA: Ooh. Well, hello!
Gotta go help
this hot number.
Wish me luck.
Welcome!
She is a live wire.
But she's right.
You two kids make
the most adorable couple.
Matthew, look at you!
You're going to the prom
with the most beautiful girl.
Yes. Beautiful girl,
prom. We're doing it.
Yay.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
Matthew, is anything
the matter?
No.
Okay.
Well, you know that
you can always come
to me to talk, right?
About anything,
anything at all.
Yeah.
You tell me. Okay?
Everything's great, Mom.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Michael,
I don't want to tell you
how to live your life,
but it's 4:00 p.m.
You haven't left the house,
except to go to school,
for days.
Okay.
This time I'm not
taking no for
an answer, mister.
Sit up.
You look at me,
and you talk to me now.
What's wrong?
(SIGHS) It's just...
Why can't things
stay the same?
Do you remember
when your mom
and I split up?
Yeah.
What happened?
You cried and built
a lot of birdhouses.
And then what happened?
You took me to Disney
World for two weeks,
and even I thought
it was too long.
And then what happened?
You became friends
with Mom again.
And why do you
think we did that?
For me?
No.
We did it
because we loved
each other very much,
and that's a rare thing.
History is a powerful
thing, Michael.
Home is a powerful thing.
No more sleeping until 4:00.
(SIGHS)
What's up, Daddy Longlegs?
What are you doing here?
I just needed a drink,
and I knew this place
would let me in.
I hear that.
Are you crying, man?
No, dude.
I'm close.
How are things
with you and Matty?
Uh, Matty is not answering
my calls as of late.
What? Why?
I mean, I get it.
It's not easy to come
out of the closet and
then stay there.
When I came out
in high school,
my best friend,
he basically disowned me.
And he was
a water polo player.
It's the faggiest sport
there is. Those guys
wax their assholes.
When I came out,
my best friend stopped
sharing sodas with me,
stopped giving me
rides to school,
de-friended me on Facebook,
and then moved to Germany.
The moving part was unrelated
to me coming out, he claims.
I don't want to be
one of those guys.
I've been just a huge jerk.
Have you talked
to Matty about it?
I've tried to.
He won't talk to me.
Maybe you need to try
a little bit harder.
Maybe you need to find out
where he's gonna be,
you need to corner him,
and make him hear
what you have to say.
Boom.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
So, this is it.
This is it, prom.
Whoo!
Could you guys get
a little closer together?
Oh.
Closer.
Closer.
Really? Okay.
Perfect.
(CLICKS)
Okay.
So far, so good.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, Matty.
What do you think
you're doing?
Dude.
JOSH: (CHUCKLES)
Whoa!
Michael, did you bring
a bearded dude to prom,
or am I just ripped
out of my fucking mind
right now?
Both.
This is Greg.
Hi.
Cheers, buddy.

No, you're not gonna

Go. Come on.
Go, go, go.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
Hey, Lars. Lars.
I gotta do something
important right now.
It will take five minutes.
No can do, Mikey.
We're destroying it.
This is our moment.
Dude, I know. Please.
Get the fuck off the stage.
Yeah.
Hey, potty mouth.
You get off the stage,
or I'm cutting the power off.
Shit, it's the principal.
Go.
(MICHAEL SIGHS)
Don't kill our momentum, bro.
Thanks.
(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Hey, everybody.
I'm sorry to
interrupt your prom.
I just wanted to sing a song,
if you don't mind.
The song is about
dealing with change,
which I am not very good at.
Um...
I've done a lot
of stupid things
the last couple of months,
and, uh, I think
I'm learning
to be better at it.
So here we go.

BOY: Gay!
Were you talking
about me or the song?
BOY: You!
Okay. Good, actually.
Because that ties
into something else
I wanted to mention
while I'm up here,
that even though I'm not gay,
I'm a straight man,
I brought a guy
to prom tonight,
a really cool guy.
I did that because
it shouldn't matter
who you bring to prom.
And it shouldn't matter
who you're
attracted to in life
or who you fall in love with.
Just bring whoever
you want to prom.
And as for the gay thing,
gay people are just people
who have sex
a little bit differently.
And I'm sure that it
still feels amazing.
So, yeah, call me gay.
I don't care. Doesn't
bother me one bit.
BOY: Gay!
Okay. Well, I got through
to you then, I guess.
So thank you
guys for listening.
Enjoy your prom.
That took big,
King Kong-sized
donkey balls.
Thanks. Thank you.
Hey, man,
are you sure
you're not gay?
Yeah, pretty sure.
Because a lot
of people are going to think
you're gay after tonight.
I know.
It's okay.
Aw, man, I let her
out of my sight
for one second.
Check it out. Here comes Ava.
She's gonna be so pissed!
DAN: Oh.
MICHAEL: Wow.
Oh!
Ah!
GREG: That girl is a freak.
I need some air.
Hey.
Hey.
MATTY: Hey.
Hey.
I liked what
you said up there.
It's not enough.
It doesn't make
up for everything.
It's a start.
I know I was
super-weird
in there earlier.
But I'm really glad
to see you here.
It's good
to see you, too.
Even if it is at a prom,
because they are terrible.
A prom is like one gigantic,
shitty wedding between
500 idiotic teenagers.
Yeah, it's bad.
That first day
when we were talking
about Matty coming out,
I should have
gotten him that cake
that said "you're gay."
It would have been
better than all
the stupid stuff I did.
There's still time.
There's a bakery
right around the corner
that specializes in
gay apology cakes.
Really?
Where is it?
Just kidding.
I know you're
fucking with me this time.
Always fucking with me.
And I'm sorry that I
stopped calling you.
I'm really sorry
for freaking out on you.
Don't be sorry.
And if there's anything
that I can do to help,
you let me know.
You're doing it right now.
Do you think you and I
could ever hang out again?
Yeah, I'd like that.
Actually, I have to go
do one more thing tonight.
There's something I need
to do before this whole
thing gets wrapped up.
Good luck.
Go.
(CHUCKLES)
Yo. Are you
leaving already?
No, I was just gonna
grab this and then find you.
(CHUCKLES) You brought
the brownie to prom?
I bring it everywhere.
It's like my baby.
I'm sorry about
all the stuff I did.
I actually brought
this here tonight
because I want you and I
to get rid of this together.
This brownie
represents the old me
who was just afraid
things wouldn't
stay the same,
and that we wouldn't
be the same kind of
friends anymore.
I know it's stupid,
but that's how it felt.
So, you and I need
to destroy this
thing tonight.
Fuck, no!
What?
This brownie is
fucking beautiful.
And what you said
tonight on stage, dude,
that was so awesome.
(CHUCKLES)
I think I'm going
to come out
to my parents.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, I think it's
gonna be all right.
That is great, man.
So, are we gonna eat
this thing or what?
Right now?
Yeah, it's amazing.
Look at the artistry
on all these dicks.
You frosted veins
on this one's shaft.
Well, I used a pastry bag
with a special nozzle.
And this one over here,
the pubes are gorgeous.
I want to put
the pubes in my mouth.
You love pubes?
You're goddamn right,
I love pubes!
Cool.
I love this brownie,
and I love you.
In a totally non-gay way.
I love you, too, non-gay.
Let's bring it in.
Oh, man!
Non-gay!
Extremely non-gay.
Not interested at all.
What are you doing?
I'm picking you up!
Put me down!
Don't punch me, man.
I'm sensitive.
EM: Hey.
Is this the famous brownie?
How old is this thing?
Super-old.
But I kept it in the freezer,
so it's cool.
And I only poured beer on it
a couple of times,
and I cried on it once.
That's cool.
Is there enough for four?
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Oh, my God,
I'm so high! (LAUGHS)
What should we do now?
I mean,
we cannot go back
into prom like this.
There's only one
place you can go
when you're this high.
(SCREAMING)
MICHAEL: I love foam!
This is the best
night of my life!
(EM LAUGHING)
