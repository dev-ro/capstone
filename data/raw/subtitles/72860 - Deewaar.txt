Ladies and gentlemen..
That medal will be awarded now...
...which every police officer
desires to wear on his chest.
This medal is awarded
every year to that officer...
...who not only does his duty...
...but who goes beyond that,
and safeguards the law itself.
This year that medal is awarded to our
upcoming, outstanding officer...
...sub-lnspector Ravi Verma.
Honourable Minister,
my senior officers, and friends.
What l'm about to say,
is nothing really new.
The awardee always states
"l don't deserve this honour".
lt's a different matter of course,
that they don't really mean it.
But in fact, it's the truth.
The world honours and respects
the man behind every achievement.
But behind that man
there are others too...
...who go unnoticed,
and not known by people.
Whose name is not printed
in any book, paper or gazette.
Before accepting this medal, l want
to name the person behind my feat.
That person is Sumitradevi.
Who, fortunately, happens to be...
...my mother.
The feat for which l'm being feted
is no doubt, done by these hands.
But the strength
in them was my mother's!
That's why l'd like my mother
be allowed to accept this medal.
Come, Madam... Let me take you...
"Long live Anandbabu."
Today is the 1 1th
day of our strike.
But it seems,
that our stone-deaf owners...
...haven't yet understood
what we are demanding.
They think we want to
deprive them of their wealth.
Not true. They think we
wish to be rich like them...
...and make them poor like us.
This is also not true.
We just want to point
out that the labourer...
...who extracts coal from the mines
searches for fuel for his own hearth.
And we also demand,
that the dark nights...
...that have clouded our lives,
for all these years now...
...be done and over with,
and let a new morn dawn!
- Long live!
- Mr. Anand!
And that morning
will dawn on that day...
...when the workers get the right
and a proper share for their efforts.
A hospital to treat them, and
a good school for their children.
lf my voice is reaching
the owners of these mines...
...then let them listen.
We're not complaining about...
...why are the vases in
their rooms full of fresh flowers.
We are complaining why are
our tins in the kitchens empty?
We're not complaining
why these coal mines...
...yield gold for them.
We're complaining...
...why do we get just brass?
lf, at this moment my voice...
...is reaching their ears,
then let them hear.
That this strike
will not be over...
...as long as there's
strength in us.
"Long live Anandbabu."
- He's a good orator.
- Shall l shut him up?
No. Don't ever make that mistake.
lf a leader dies an untimely death,
he becomes a martyr forever.
- His long life is his death.
- Then what do we do?
He can't be bribed either.
lf not by money, something else.
Every man has his weaknesses.
One weak point...
Put a finger on that and he's ready
to sell off all his principles.
But the point is...
what is Anandbabu's weak point?
Aren't the boys back
from school as yet?
They'll be here, you get
so upset if they're slightly late!
Brother stop.
Here they are.
Brother stop. Brother stop.
Mom!
- Come here, where were you?
- ln school.
Come, come. Sit. Good boy.
- How was school today?
- Our teacher said...
- He said something about you.
- Really? What did he say?
- He said, 'your father... '
- No, no. He said, Anandbabu.
- Yes, that you are a man of principles."
- Yes, father.
- ls that true? - Can't say son.
- Run along. l've made 'kheer' today.
Come on, go.
You should see their pranks! Either
they read the paper like you.
Or they'll stand on the chain and lecture!
You mean the world to them.
And who else do l have
in this world except them?
- Did anyone give pamphlets?
- Yes he did.
He was saying the same thing. That
you're the only hope they have.
Yes. Tomorrow we're going to protest
in front of the owner's bungalow.
Let's see what happens.
Agree to our demands.
Give us our rights.
Please gentlemen... the owners
are ready to discuss things.
Send your representative
who'll talk on your behalf.
Come in.
- Greetings, sir.
- Sit down.
l've all the papers ready
for a compromise between us.
You made them ready,
before talking to the labourers?
Read the papers first,
and then sign.
Did you call me in,
to play this practical joke on me?
l've already refused to
sign whatever's written in this.
You haven't seen the full file yet.
Turn another page and see.
Sir..
l'm a businessman.
l also don't like such gimmicks.
But sometimes people like you,
force me to do them.
- Where is my family?
- Wherever they are, they are fine.
Do you realize, sir, that
you are committing a serious crime?
You can stop me from committing it.
Sign these papers, and tomorrow your
family will return to you safely.
And if l refuse to sign?
Nothing much. l'll just
tear this photograph into pieces.
Are you threatening me?
You don't know this man.
His name is Bachchan Singh.
He has gone to jail twice.
That too for murder!
- Once for throttling a kid of 7...
- Listen, sir...
- l'm listening.
- l...
- l want my family.
- And l want your signature.
l've signed the papers
concerning our demands.
- l've agreed to all the conditions.
- What do you mean by that?
l've agreed that we'll
all toil on the same pay scale.
l've also accepted that henceforth,
if we go on a strike...
...it'll be illegal.
l've... l've sold you all to them.
Get down, all of you.
lf you utter a word about this...
...you and your kids will
meet the same fate as your husband.
l know. l know why you did it.
You did it for me,
and for your children.
You were helpless...
Anandbabu is a thief.
lt's on everyone's lip
that Anandbabu is a thief.
Just some naughty boys.
You'll see, people will
soon forget and forgive you.
You'll soon gain their
respect like before.
Honestly, they'll all respect you.
Get these medicines, will you?
Don't look so worried.
lt'll be fine.
l'll go and get the medicines.
Anandbabu is a fraud.
Look! There goes the
wife of our owner's pimp.
- He really got beaten up!
- So? Must have made lolly too.
ln dealing with coals,
only the hand gets blackened.
- His whole face got blackened.
- He's a bloody fraud.
He's a bloody fraud.
No! Oh No...
Tattoo my darling's name on my arm,
will you?
Better think. For, once l tattoo,
it'll never come off!
Look there goes that boy...
What's your name?
- This is Anandbabu's son.
- Oh, l see.
So this is the offspring
of that cheat, eh?
- What's your name?
- Vijay.
And your father's name?
Mr. Anand.
Say "Thief"...
You say, what you tattoo
cannot be erased, eh?
- Then tattoo on his arm.
- What? - "My father is a thief."
What happened, son?
Who beat you up?
Tell me, son. Why don't you speak?
"My father is a thief."
Vijay... my son!
We won't stay here now.
They are all against us.
We'll go away from here.
We'll go away!
How will we live here?
How will we eat?
l'm here... Your mother.
Careful, my dear...
- Vijay!
- What happened, mom?
Where's Ravi? He was here now.
Must be here somewhere. l'll see.
"The best place in
this world is our lndia."
There he is, Mother.
"Our lndia!"
Why are you crying?
Then what shall l do?
l can't earn enough even
to send you both to school.
You don't earn enough
to educate us both, but...
...we both can earn enough to
send Ravi to school. l'll earn too.
My son!
But you're just a kid.
What work will you do?
Give me two race book.
- And the 2nd race?
- ln the 2nd race...
Royal Salute to Halla Gulla.
l see. We have a good chance there.
- And the 6th race? - "Manga".
- Okay, but not for a long distance.
- Meaning? - A horse which runs
slow at first, is for a long race.
- Once he speeds up, he leaves
everyone else behind. - Done, sir.
Pay him.
l polish shoes. l don't beg. Pick
up that coin and hand it to me.
- Hear that, sir?
- Yes.
Give him the money.
- What!
- Yes, give it to him.
Jaichand..
That is a long-distance runner!
Did you see his arrogance?
He won't shine shoes all his life.
The day he picks up speed in life,
he'll leave everyone behind.
Mark my words.
This boy will come up in life.
He will make a name for himself.
He gets the highest marks in class.
Well done! Now go to your place.
Thank you, teacher.
Come on children. Open your books.
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!
Are you blind? Do you own these
bricks to break them like this?
- Sorry, sir. - Sorry, my foot!
She's so delicate she can't work!
Then go and do something
you are capable of!
Mind your tongue!
Look at that. lt's a sin
even to show pity these days.
She had literally begged for work.
Now, she's drunk. How can she work?
- Get lost from here.
- l've 2 small kids. Have mercy.
l've seen many like you,
who hire kids, and beg around!
Now get lost! Go on...
She broke new bricks.
l've to give accounts to the boss.
She's up in front for money,
and when it comes to work, she's...
Blood! Whose kid is that?
Catch him!
Why did he swear at you?
The poor have to bear everything.
lf tomorrow l find some other
work will l be given privileges?
Nothing will change with
you throwing a stone, son.
What is written in one's destiny,
nobody can erase.
Look at me. See how l bear
all the nasty remarks silently.
Ravi is your brother
but you both are so different.
Yes, that's true.
We're poles apart.
And the biggest difference...
...is this!
Mom!
- l won't go in the temple.
- What nonsense are you talking?
l don't want anything from God.
l'm not going in!
lf you don't go in, l'll never
speak to you, nor give you food.
Excuse me, but don't
force him to go in the temple.
For one prays with faith, not
force. The day his faith awakens...
...he'll walk in, on his own.
Now go in and pray.
Come, Ravi.
Tell me, Mom, what do you
ask from God when you come here?
Shall l tell you? Joy for you,
and peace for your brother.
Either you don't talk
to Him seriously, or...
He doesn't take you seriously.
That's why l don't get a job.
May be He's on the look
out for a good job for you.
So that's how it is!
Listen, be sure to tell Him...
...that l won't mind even if it
pays me Rs. 250 or so, - Nonsense!
l fool around a bit. Else, l don't
have a grudge against God like him!
lt's been years now, but he...
Why don't you talk to him?
Mom... you just see that
he doesn't enter the Temple.
But you don't notice that he
sits on its steps, daily for you.
Finished your prayers?
Let's go. l've to go.
Here, have this,
- Take it.
- Here we go again.
She's giving it to you as a Holy
offering. You eat it as a treat.
You both will be happy that way.
Give it to him...
Good.
Me too. Look Mom, l'm the one who's
getting fat eating this daily.
Even then l'm without a job!
l'll go to the Employment Exchange.
lf l'm late, l won't get a job.
Bye, Mom; see you, brother.
How are you?
Fine, son. Till the new
truck comes, we'll use this.
Careful there...
A new boy... He'll learn by and by.
Yes.
Every day l mean to ask you,
but l forget. About your badge.
- My badge?
- Yes. What's the number?
- 786.
- Right. 786.
ln Muslims this is a good omen.
Like Hindus have 'OM'.
- What does "786" mean?
- lt means "Bismillah."
"l start in the name of
God" lt's an auspicious omen, son.
lt'll bring prosperity.
keep it on you always.
Take this load, will you?
Gangu!
- Hello, uncle.
- Call me uncle, eh?
Not this way, son.
Like this. Understand?
l was also of his age.
When l became a porter.
How long have you been here? You
must have seen a lot of changes.
Nothing has changed! l carried load
before, today also, it's the same.
We had to pay the local ruffians
some money, to earn a living.
Today, too, l pay them.
People say, times have changed.
May be. l've just seen
the people who extort us change!
Greetings, sir.
So, Peter?
How's everything? Well, l hope.
Of course, sir! Will anyone
dare not to give money to my men?
Today, it's pay-day
for these porters here, sir.
Money will reach your office.
- Give it to Rana.
- Yes, sir.
He'll give you your share.
Here's some as pocket money.
Thank you, sir!
What's all this, uncle?
Why are they taking money from us?
- This is our 'bail' for being poor.
- What?
You're new here, but you'll learn.
They are a local hooligan's men.
He takes Rs. 2 from us all.
- But why do they take it?
- Why?
Nobody has dared to ask till now.
You also don't question them.
- Just pay your Rs. 2/-, and go.
- No!
Why should l give?
No, l won't pay them.
Have l come here to earn for them?
l've to send a M.O. Home.
My mother, and 2 sisters live
there. lf l send money from now...
...then only we can collect a dowry
for them. Else, how will they marry?
No! And you ask me to pay them.
Why should l give them?
l won't give.
Come on...
- What are you staring at?
Put your money in this. - No!
- What? You won't give, eh?
- He's a new boy. He'll learn.
- Come on, son, pay up.
- No! Why should l pay him?
- You damn fool!
- He's taking my money.
Help me somebody.
lt's my mother's money he's taking.
He died in route to the hospital.
And what for? Forjust...
- Forjust Rs. 2/-?
- Why didn't he pay? We all do.
ln this world, the poor
have to hear a lot and exist.
And these are hooligans.
Who'll question them?
You're right. Absolutely right.
l'm around 25 years now. l've
not seen anyone refusing to pay.
Uncle, what didn't happen
in 25 years, will happen now!
Another porter will refuse
to part with his money next week!
Your name?
Name?
- Ravi.
- Ravi what?
Ravi Verma.
Education?
- You can say l'm a graduate.
- What do you mean by that?
l mean, l'm B.A.
- Your height?
- 5 feet. 9, 10 or 1 1 inches!
- What's this 9, 10 or 1 1 inches?
- 5 ft 10 inches!
That's the trouble. You get nervous.
lf you're like this with me...
...how will you fare there?
You didn't answer me confidently.
You get so jittery.
You are right. l get nervous...
...and then l talk all rot,
and people think l know nothing!
But never mind.
This time l'll be so
prepared that l'll stun them!
l'll look into my
interviewer's eyes...
...and say...
- What will you say?
My name is Ravi Verma.
- Your education?
- l'm B.A. And my height is 5' 10"!
l didn't ask you your height.
Oh, sorry sir.
lf you have your certificates...
..let me have a look at them.
- Here you are, sir.
Good. Very good.
Sports.
Excellent!
'So you possess these qualities
also along with education.'
We wanted a smart man
like you for this job.
Then, shall l think
that l'll get this job?
Excuse me.
Hello!
Good morning, sir. Good morning.
Speaking, sir.
Yes, you had mentioned it.
Yes, l've met him.
On your son's birthday...
...you had invited me, too.
l had met him there.
Of course it'll be done.
Right, sir.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
That was the G.M. On the line.
- About that job, sir.
- Job?
Mr. Ravi...
That job has been
given to somebody else.
Given to somebody else?
But you just said...
Yes, l know, but l just
spoke to my G.M., you see.
His brother-in-law...
You see he is deserving...
- You see.
- Yes, sir.
l can see.
Look, don't take it very badly.
No, sir.
How can l take it badly?
lt's me, who's bad.
l have a degree,
plus other certificates.
But l don't have a
letter of recommendation!
Thank you, sir.
Next.
Thank you.
Listen.
- Have you come here for an
interview too? - Yes.
- Do you have any relative as a G.M.,
or a Director here? - No.
Then you won't get a job here.
You wasting time here.
Better go home.
Oh come on, Ravi!
- This wasn't the last job on earth!
- l won't even get that!
Look, my dear.
lt was fine till college.
We were in the same class, attended
same lectures, and had tea together.
But this world is not our college.
lt's a chest of drawers, a cupboard.
- lt has different compartments.
And you... - Daughter of D.C. P...
...is right in the top drawer,
and you are at the bottom! Right?
Yes! And why do you waste your
time with me? What's your gain?
l wished for you
and l have got you.
You wished for me,
and you have got me.
And now!
Whatever we get! Or we don't.
We don't have any regrets.
l wished for you
and l have got you.
You wished for me,
and you have got me.
Not only is the
cool shade but also..
..the hot sunshine
is present on the way.
Whether there is
sorrow or happiness..
..we have to accept
everything with open arms.
Not only is the
cool shade but also..
..the hot sunshine
is present on the way.
Whether there is
sorrow or happiness..
..we have to accept
everything with open arms.
O unhappy man living in this world,
don't you know this?'
l wished for you
and l have got you.
You wished for me,
and you have got me.
lf you are so stubborn
then l will never complain again.
l will tolerate all
the sorrows with a smile.
lf you are so stubborn
then l will never complain again.
l will tolerate all

Something that hurts you, l
have never done anything like that.

and you have got me.
- And now.
- And now.
- Whatever we get.

We don't have any regrets.
l wished for you
and l have got you.
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

and l have got you.
You wished for me,
and you have got me.
Where are you going?
Put your money in there.
What are you looking at?
Out with your money!
Are you drunk or something?
That porter has the
guts to hit my man?
Today one man refused to pay.
Tomorrow two, and so on.
You all go and get
that bastard right here!
And beat the hell out of him.
Go now!
- Seen Vijay?
- No. l know nothing.
- Where is he?
- Don't know.
- You're here?
- Why?
Peter's men are looking for you.
- Where are you going?
- Outside on the road. - What for?
Go out from the back, son.
- Does the road belong to Peter?
- l won't hear of it!
Listen, you call me 'Uncle', right?
- Son, please go from this side.
- Alright.
- We didn't find him anywhere.
- l think he has run away.
- He won't be back!
- Where will he go? We'll get him.
Don't spare him. kill him!
Peter!
Stop!
Good you came yourself.
l was looking for you.
You were looking for me, and l...
was waiting for you here.
So that's how it is.
keep these in your pocket.
l'll open this lock, only when
l take these keys from your pocket.
Here.
Catch! Catch him! Beat him up!
Beat him!
Break the bastard's legs!
Get up!
You'll open the lock, eh?
You bastard! l'll open that lock.
keep the keys back in your pocket.
keep them!
Long live, Vijay!
Why did you have to fight them?
There are other workers too.
Were you the "chosen-one"?
You didn't think that...
...if something happened to you,
what will l do? Those hooligans...
...they draw knives for nothing.
Oh Mom! lt's done now.
Shut up! You're lecturing me?
lf you're so clever...
...then share that with him
who doesn't even let me die calmly!
When you knew they were after you,
why did you go and face them?
Couldn't you have sneaked out?
You wanted me to run like a coward?
What was that? What did you say?
- What did you say?
- Mom!
- Let me go!
- No, mom.
What does he mean by that?
Whatever he did, was for us.
For all of us!
So that we'd be alive.
We would live!
Manager, it's 1 1 o'clock.
That boy still hasn't come.
- What do you think?
Shall we give him a chance? - Sure.
Look, we had decided on a salesman
but l think, the job was yours.
- Then do l get this job?
- You speak English well, don't you?
- Yes, l suppose so.
- Then start from today.
- Explain his work to him.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Excuse me, but l'm a bit late.
- Not "bit", but a lot!
l thought you won't come,
so l gave him the job. Right?
Yes, sir.
Don't do that. l'm really hard up.
Actually, l didn't have
money even for the bus-fare today.
- l got late because l walked.
- Okay, but we've employed him.
- But you didn't tell me how
much l'll get, sir. - Rs. 350/-
What! l'd have got a job ages ago
if l had accepted such petty pay.
- Then did you expect Rs. 3,500/-?
- No, but even then... Never mind.
- l don't want yourjob!
- Give him the job.
l say, sir. l'm...
- Congrats!
- l'm... what can l say, sir?
lt's okay. This world has become
a 3rd class compartment of a train.
Less space, more passengers.
lf l'd have sat, you'd have stood!
- All the best.
- Thank you.
Haven't you slept as yet, son?
- Go and sleep, Mom.
- What's this you're writing?
Whenever there are vacancies,
l'm sending applications.
lt's very late. Go and sleep.
Look, it's nearly dawn.
lt's not dawn as yet.
The day will dawn...
...when everyone will have a home,
a job, and nobody will be poor.
And the day will dawn when
the labourers get their right...
And when that day dawns... Oh God!
That's the trouble with reading.
A layman becomes an orator.
Okay, go to sleep now.
Nowadays train travel
has become a nuisance!
l say, sir. Where are you going?
l'm asking you, sir.
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Hey you! Yes, you.
Boss wants you.
ls your name Vijay?
Yes.
- Did you thrash Samant's men
in their own house? - Who's Samant?
ln whose safe goes the money
extorted from the dock-hands.
Samant's my enemy too. lf you wish,
we can help each other.
How?
Get in.
Get in. Don't be scared.
- Look upon me as a friend.
- Friends have names too.
My name is Davar.
Start the car, driver.
Besides extorting money from
dock-hands and mill-workers...
Samant and his men have
fingers in other pies too!
Like liquor-dens;
gambling-dens, smuggling...
...and looting other smugglers.
That's where you become foes!
My gold comes from Dubai.
l don't know how he comes to know.
Samant and his men
have thrice stolen my gold.
l need such a man, who, after
the gold is unloaded, till it...
...reaches the godown, protects
it from the police and Samant.
Vijay.
l need you. And l can
take care of all your needs.
Do you agree?
What are you looking at?
l'm looking at the pavement there.
A helpless woman,
with 2 innocent kids.
Weak with hunger. And homeless.
l accept your deal, sir.
Good.
Today is your first day
at your new job. Here, keep this.
Sir, many years ago,
you attended the races.
And parked your car at a certain
place and had your shoes polished.
Yes, why?
l don't pick up money thrown at me,
even today!
Oh, l'm sorry.
keep this file and cap on the table
and don't forget that brief-case.
Hi, Veera!
Hi, dad.
Hello, sir.
- Hi, young man.
- We're caught now.
Where were you, Ravi?
What are you doing these days?
Why hide it from you, sir?
l'm nowhere these days.
- Nowhere? Then join the police.
- Police force? Me?
l'm not joking. We need
young educated men like you.
- Didn't you see the advert?
- You think he can become an officer?
Of course! But don't expect
me to put in a good word for you.
You won't? Then l'll send
an application tomorrow itself!
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.
Make me a cup of tea too, dear.
l'll change and come. Sit down, son.
Thank you, sir.
So! You'll be a police officer too.
Yes.
ln my last birth l must have been a dacoit!
My father's in the police...
...and now you!
Why is the police after me?
A shipment of gold will reach
Versova beach exactly at 1 1 p.m.
You'll all be there.
Vijay and Darpan kumar...
...will be at a distance,
keeping a look out on all sides.
As soon as the steamer comes,
Jaichand will go to those people...
...and show this torn
piece of a note to them.
The other half of this note will be
with them. They'll join the pieces.
And give the gold to Jaichand.
Sir... l want to say something.
The job that you've hired me for...
...how to go about it,
is also my job.
l don't get you.
You want gold.
lt'll reach you safely.
But there's a condition to it.
Leave this job safely to me.
- You want to do this job alone?
- Yes, sir.
You think you can
do it on your own?
No, sir.
l know l can do it alone.
Okay.
l'll try my luck with you.
You'll do this job alone.
Take this piece of note.
But remember...
The police will be
after you and also, Samant!
Only my luck will back me, sir.
You won't need that.
l want to talk business with him.
You want to talk business
by stopping the lift like this?
l'm told that the walls of a lift,
don't have ears!
Sir, if l tell you when,
and where...
...Mr. Davar's gold is to land,
how much will you give me?
lf this is a joke,
you won't live to enjoy it!
lf you take it as a joke,
then you'll live to cry later on.
The gold is worth 5,00,000/-!
How do you know all this?
You just eat the fruit.
Why bother about the trees?
Tell me, what will be my share?
5,00,000/- But only
after l get the gold.
Okay. Send your men there.
The steamer will be at the
Versova beach at 1 1 p.m. Tonight.
And... take this.
You'll get the gold
when you give this.
lf you're lying,
it'll be the last time you'll lie!
Because until we get the
gold you'll be held as a hostage.
l'm ready.
You keep the 5,00,000/- ready!
Rana.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Okay. Okay.
Listen, park the van in the garage.
And bring the stuff
here in an another car.
Your information was correct.
We got the gold.
And now l must get my Rs.
5,00,000/-.
Of course. But...
You didn't say who you are.
My telling that will not
lower the price of the gold!
The work is done. l want my money!
We got the gold. Now what
if l don't pay you the money?
Sir, l knew a
fairy-tale as a child.
A man had a hen,
which laid a golden egg everyday.
One day he thought,
"why not tear the hen's stomach...
...and get the eggs
once and for all?
And he killed the hen! Think!
You want all your eggs today? Or...
- l was just pulling your leg.
- l knew it.
Here you are All of 500,000/-
- When will you inform me again?
- Very soon.
Come on, unload goods. Hurry up.
keep your hands up!
Thank you for all the trouble.
...you took to bring the gold here.
Now l'll take it to Mr.
Davar's godown from here.
Think. This kind of animosity
with Samant will prove expensive!
When l buy such trouble,
l don't care about the cost!
Face the wall. Come on!
Look the other way.
lf anybody turns round before this
van leaves the garage, l'll shoot.
And this time l won't
aim the bullet on the hand!
Someone dies..
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.
- Let it be.
- Let it be.
- Let it be, l have seen..
- The world too.
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.
- Someone dies..
- Someone dies..
Someone dies for someone,

lt goes like this.
You are crazy for me, that's great.
But this love is
just for one night.
You are crazy for me, that's great.
But this love is
just for one night.
Once the night passes away,
the matter will end.
You will come to your
senses again tomorrow.
Everyone falls in love.
Everyone is ready to
risk their life for it.
But l have seen
it only for a while.
- Let it be.
- Let it be.
- Let it be, l have seen..
- The world too.
Let it be,

Everyday you desire
a new gorgeous face.
Today you crave for her..
..but tomorrow you
will desire someone else.
When you will see a new face,
you will get restless.
You will change like the weather.
l have seen many
lovers earlier too.
l have seen this game earlier too.
- Let it be.
- Let it be.
- Let it be, l have seen..
- The world too.
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.
- Someone dies..

Someone dies for someone,

- Just a moment.
Vijay, a call for you. - Me?
Thank you.
Hello.
- Vijay speaking.
- Congrats! That was a classic move!
- Thank you.
- You started this game.
l promise, l'll finish it!
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
- Who was it?
- Samant, to congratulate me.
l see.
How did you get this
hole on your jacket's pocket?
- Samant's men took a shot at me.
- What!
Yes. But by chance...
...l had my badge in my pocket.
Badge No. 786.
- So this thing saved you?
- Yes.
Very lucky. Come.
This is your share, plus the
5,00,000/- you brought with you.
- All this money...
- Yes, it's all yours.
Come in, Mom.
This will be our drawing-room.
Here, a small temple for you.
Come.
This is the kitchen, and...
...this, the dining room.
That room there, will be Ravi's.
Come on upstairs.
l show you around.
But this house looks expensive.
Don't worry about that, Mom.
The people you're working for, will
they give you such a big house?
Look Mom.
The terrace that shall come here...
l hope you're not doing
something which you shouldn't do.
No, Mom, l'm not doing
anything l shouldn't be doing.
That's a load off my mind.
l think "load" is part of our fate.
lt slipped from my
shoulders to your mind.
Come.
Mom!
Brother! lt's fantastic!
- What happened?
- Tell us.
- Why are you shouting so?
- Why not? lt's worth shouting for.
lt's simple fantastic. Everything
falls in place when the time comes.
l've been selected, and in 3
months l'll be a police inspector!
Brother, shake hand.
Bless me, Mom.
My blessings are always with you.
May God bless you
both with success.
- When will you reach, son?
- ln about 3 to 31/2 hours.
- Write to Mom, okay? - Sure.
- Will you come for the weekends?
lf l write to you and
also come for the weekends.
...when will l get the time
for the training? And leave is...
Hello, Ravi. l'm so sorry for late.
You know what...
This is my mom, Viru.
Greetings!
Mom, this is Viru.
And this is my brother.
Hello!
Mom, she's my class-fellow.
- Shall we go. Mom?
- Let his train leave.
He's not a kid. He'll go.
l'll drop you and then go to work.
- Right then, Mom.
- Take care, son.
Yes.
She's nice.
Thank you.
See how sad Mom is!
And you? You even came late!
As if l came late purposely l
thought l'd bring you some flowers.
Okay, let's not fight.
Just one minute to go.
Say something sweet to me.
Hurry now.
You're going?
No, l came here to pass my time.
The train will go and l'll walk away.
Of course l'm going!
What a thing to ask!
Why get so angry?
Then why do you ask
such stupid questions?
Vijay.
Do you know how Sawant
comes to know our moves?
You must have seen Dayal.
He used to work for me.
He was Samant's man..
Dayal?
Yes, last night,
while crossing the road...
...he was run-over by a truck
Sir, just as, Sawant's man...
...was amongst us as an informer...
...why not have our
of our men in his camp...
...who'll inform
us about his plans.
l agree, Vijay...
...that you outsmarted Samant once.
But you don't know him. He's shrewd.
True. Samant never gives a
job to anyone without sifting him!
Lt'll be very difficult
for one of us to join him.
Suppose one man...
Today, what does Samant
want most of all? My life!
So, if a man like
say Darpan here...
Darpan should tell Samant,
that tomorrow night at 10.30...
...l'll be leaving a particular
bar, unarmed, and alone.
My car will be parked opposite,
and as l go towards my car...
...Samant's men can attack me.
- When you don't leave at 10.30...
...Samant's men will...
- l'll leave at 10.30 sharp!
Then they will believe
that Darpan is our enemy.
A foe of the enemy is a friend.
That's why...
...Darpan will get a job there.
You're forgetting one thing.
lf you do leave at the said time,
then your life is in peril.
- And they'll certainly go for you.
- l know, sir.
ln this attack l may escape,
or l may die.
But in both cases,
your man, Darpan...
...will get a place
in Samant's gang.
Why did you tell
this to us about Vijay?
What is your benefit in it?
l have two benefits Samant sir.
He's the one who got me
thrown out of Davar's employment.
lf your men kill him,
l'll be more happy than you.
Secondly, if my information
pleases you, you may employ me.
lf you're telling the truth,
l may employ you.
But if it turns out to be
a trap you'll never walk again!
My information is correct.
Tonight, Vijay...
...will leave that bar alone
unarmed at 10.30 p.m. Sharp.
Jaggi, Rana.
l am burning in love,
with a stranger.
Thank you.
No need to thank me.
l was looking for an excuse,
to talk to you, anyway.
l was thinking,
that at this very moment.
...nobody is as handsome,
nor so alone, as you, in this bar.
Who wants to risk his life,
and be with me at this moment?
May be you said that
so that l'd leave you alone.
Else, you don't seem to be
very disappointed with yourself.
This liquor is an amazing thing.
Each has his own reason to enjoy it.
Someone's drinking because he's
tired after a grueling day at work.
Some, because they did nothing
the whole day, and are bored.
Others, because they
are with their friends today.
And yet some,
because they are alone, Right?
Why am l thinking?
Because you're awaiting someone.
And the ones l'm waiting
for must be awaiting me outside.
- Barman.
- Yes, sir.
For both the drinks.
Okay, sir.
Bye.
Thank you.
Excuse me, did you forget
something in the bar?
Were you waiting for these guys?
Yes?
What can be the name of
such a strange man like you?
Vijay.
Will you light a cigarette for me?
Sure.
- You didn't ask me my name?
- What's the point in asking?
Your kind of a girl changes
her name Like one changes clothes.
Yes, that's true.
And it's also true that l'm telling
a stranger; for the first time...
...that my parents
had named me Anita.
l'm proud of you my boy.
You really had a close shave
with death. But how did you escape?
l was once again saved by this.
Badge No. 786!
Vijay, Come here.
From today,
you'll sit in this chair.
Sir?
Let me relax a bit now, my boy.
And you're managing everything
anyway. So why should l worry?
Best of luck.
Jaichand.
Remember, Jaichand?
This happened years ago.
You threw money at a shoe-shine,
and he had refused to pick it up?
- Yes, l do, - And l had said that
one day this boy will go places?
l wasn't proved wrong.
Vijay is that very boy.
- Hello, Ravi.
- Bye.
There's a call for you from a girl.
Girl? Thanks.
You didn't call in 3 months and
how come you're phoning like this?
Hello Ravi, how are you?
Vira, you are..
Vira, l am fine.
l am coming back Vira..
My training is over and l'm
posted in Mumbai. l'm coming today.
l'm so happy. l wish you were here
when l looking l wish to see you!
So why are you scratching your nut?
Just look up and see.
Oh my Vira! You naughty girl!
Vira!
Look, he talked to
one girl on the phone..
..and he is embracing another one.
Some have all the luck.
- Shall l tell you?
- Yes.
- Or should l keep quiet?
- No.
About what my heart wishes for?
What is it?
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?
About what my heart wishes for?
l will know it only
after you express it.
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.
Really.
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?
About what my heart wishes for?
l will know it only
after you express it.
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.
You have thought of
just keeping on going.
To make a world away from everyone.
Am l right?
- Then tell me.
- Shall l tell you?
Yes.
l have thought of
taking you off course.
l want to trouble and
scare you in a lonely place.
No, no.
No, no don't do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?
About what my heart wishes for?
l will know it only
after you express it.
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.
You have thought
of humming something.
Of dancing and making
me dance with happiness.
ls it correct now?
- Then tell me.
- Shall l tell you? - Yes.
l have thought of
bringing you closer.
l have thought of
kissing your pink lips.
No, no.
No, no don't do that.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?
About what my heart wishes for?
l will know it only
after you express it.
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?

l will know it only
after you express it.
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.
May Police Officer Ravi Verma,
come in?
Ravi.
Mother!
What are you doing? Let go of me!
Why didn't you pen you were coming?
l really thought it was a policeman!
You're great!
Am l not a real policeman?
- Yes you are looking.
- l'll be in Mumbai now.
- You'll see my colours soon.
Where's Vijay? - What can l say?
Ever since he has started business
he doesn't get a moment's peace.
He comes in after midnight,
and hardly eats, if at all.
He doesn't even sleep peacefully.
He's forever tossing and turning.
- Does money brings insomnia, son?
- lt's both ways.
Having money brings insomnia, and
not having it, brings deep slumber.
l think that's Vijay.
Mother!
Brother!
- When did he come? - Just now,
Mom says you come home late.
She stays all alone in this house.
But l say the house looks great.
All this furniture, decoration...
How did you manage it so soon?
Being a policeman, are you?
Take a wash and change! Go on.
Okay, l'll have a bath. l'm
very hungry, so serve food fast.
Vijay, you have a bath too.
We'll eat together.
He's an officer..
..but he still talks
the same way. Mad.
- l will serve the food, okay.
- Okay.
All the hardships we experienced
were shared by Mom, l and Ravi
And after walking this long road,
together, side by side...
...Ravi and l have
drifted apart so much.
He's a police officer, and you...
l'm scared l may not have to hear,
what you dread to utter, from Ravi.
What are you thinking about?
l was thinking you've
given me this flat, this car.
You've bought for me
whatever luxury you could buy.
Even that didn't surprise me,
But today...
...by telling me your life
story you've really bowled me!
Why?
You are one of those who can
share his joys, but not sorrows.
l'm surprised, that today,
by sharing your woes with me...
...why have you honoured me so?
Don't know why,
but l feel you can understand me.
Yes, sir.
Give me all the information
about those the police suspect.
These are the names, but l'm sorry
that l don't know much about them.
One is, Mr. Davar,
to the public, he's a hotelier.
That's just a facade
17 years ago...
...he has served a
jail-term for smuggling.
He was lying low for years, but
now he's respected among smugglers.
There's another man with him.
..very interesting character..
Few years ago,
he was a dock-hand But nowadays...
...he owns a very
big garage l know...
...this garage is just to throw
dust in eyes of law and police.
Actually l'm sure he's one
of Davar's biggest partners...
His name?
Vijay Verma.
There are some other
men who hang around there two
Men like Jaichand, Santosh Mehta...
...Singhania. There are just small
fish in the lake. Here, keep this
Ravi, are you alright?
Yes sir, l am alright sir.
Ravi.
Give this file to
some other officer.
- l can't take this particular case.
- What?
What's the matter?
Why can't you take it?
l demand an explanation.
Sir..
Vijay Verma is my brother.
He's my brother, sir.
Oh no.
l'm sure you understand
my position, sir.
..l might not be able to
carry out this responsibility.
That's why, please give this
case to some other officer, sir.
l am sorry.
l can understand your feelings,
and l also...
...respect your honesty for
being so straightforward about it.
But even then, l'd like
you to be in change of this case.
- But, sir...
- Yes! l'd want it like that.
You've procured highest
marks in every selection test.
And today, there stands before
you the biggest test, which...
...a police officer has to confront
very rarely. And you run away?
No, sir l can't go
through with this test.
- l can't forget he's my brother.
- Think it over for today.
lf you still don't want to
go ahead l'll assign somebody else.
But before making a decision,
of any sort, just remember...
...that this is that disease
which a police officer treats...
...by overcoming all the personal
feelings, like a doctor does.
Till today,
no doctor has operated on himself!
But if you say so,
l'll give it a thought today.
Thief! Thief! Catch him! Catch him!
Stop! Stop, else l'll shoot.
Stop yelling! l hit you in the leg.
You won't die.
Tell me! What did you steal?
Just for a loaf of bread?
- Salute, sir.
- Call on ambulance.
- Your name?
- Chandar.
Where do you live?
Hello!
- May l come in?
- Yes, come in.
l'm sorry but l
haven't recognized you.
We've never met.
Then you must be Chander's friend.
- Are you his father?
- Well you see...
Chander's not at home.
l know. l know he's in hospital.
ln police custody.
lf you don't mind...
...l had brought a few things.
What is it?
You didn't say who are you.
Well, l...
l'm that officer,
who had shot your son.
Get out!
And take these alms with you!
Get lost!
What is this?
Law man, my foot!
Nice justice you give!
Does yourjustice shoot only
the poor? What had my son done?
He stole some bread for his parents.
lf you're such a legal-eagle...
...go and shoot them,
who, hoard grain in their godowns.
Shoot them who are up to
their ears in black-marketing.
l know nobody punishes them.
Only we get shot!
Go!
Get out of my house! Get out!
l would like to apologize.
My wife's uneducated, so she...
But l've no complain.
Whatever you did, was right.
Theft is a theft.
Whether of a penny or a 1,00,000/-!
Actually Chander wasn't like this.
Maybe he couldn't bear
to see us go so hungry.
But millions die of hunger in lndia.
Should they all become thieves?
l've nothing against you.
Whatever you did... was right.
What do you do for a living?
l was a teacher in a school.
l retired last year.
Now l do a few tuition's.
l could've got such a lesson,
only from some teacher's home.
Sir..
- Yes, Ravi?
- l'm prepared to take the case, sir.
Good luck.
Santosh..
Give Mr. Agarwal his check.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
keep these building
papers with you.
Mr. Vijay.
Now that this deal is done,
may l say something?
You're buying this at a very
high price. Had you requested...
...l'd have taken much less from you.
Please don't mind my saying it.
But you can't do business.
lt's you who can't do business.
Even if you'd have asked 1,00,000/-
more for it, l'd have bought it.
Really? What's so special about it?
Twenty years ago, when
this building was being built...
...my mother had carried
bricks on her head!
Today l'm giving it
as a gift to my mother.
Mother!
What's the matter, Mom?
What is it, Ravi?
Vijay, l want to
tell you something.
Today the Police department.
Gave me a list.
lt has names of those,
who the police suspect...
...do smuggling and
other illegal trades.
One of those names... is yours!
Do you have anything
else to say to me?
Sign this paper.
What's in it?
lt says that you are
willing to become an approver.
You'll tell them about your crimes,
black money and name your colleagues.
l want your signature on this.
Do you remember the nights we spent on
the pavement, starving, as kids?
- Will you sign it, or not?
- Do you remember...
...how mother had to labour
to earn 2 Rupees for her medicines?
- Will you sign, or not?
- D'you recall the abuse and rebuff?
Vijay, will you sign, or not?
Yes, l'll sign.
But l won't do it alone.
l won't be the first to sign!
Else, get that man's signature who
had taken my father's signature.
Or that man's signature who had
thrown my mother out of herjob.
And that man's too who
had got this tattooed on my arm!
After that... l'll sign on any
paper you ask me to, dear brother.
One's sins are not lessened
by talking of other people's sins.
Proving others' crimes doesn't alter
the fact that you're a criminal.
And that fact, is a wall
between us, dear brother...
...and as long as that wall exists,
we cannot live under one roof!
l'm leaving this house.
Now, this moment.
- Come, Mom. - You can go,
but Mom will not go. - Come, Mom.
- l said Mom will not go!
- Mother will go.
No Mom. You can't leave me and go.
- l know you love me Mom.
You can't leave me. - l'm going.
No Mom, you won't!
Who was that man who
made your father sign?
Nobody. lt's the same with
that man who abused, and fired me!
That man who tattooed your
name on your arm was also a nobody.
But you? You were my son.
My flesh and blood.
How could you tattoo on my head,
that her son is a thief?
But l did all this for you. This
bungalow, car, money, all for you!
lt's all yours.
And you're leaving me?
Vijay..
A true businessman, l see.
May l tell you one thing, however?
Don't try to buy your mom.
You haven't become so rich,
as to buy your own mother.
Let's go, Ravi. Come.
Twenty years ago,
when this building was coming up...
...my mother carried bricks
on her head for its construction.
Today l'm giving this building
as a gift to my mother.
Vijay, come in now.
Anita..
Make me a drink.
Sure.
- Any cigarettes around?
- ln the cupboard inside.
You wear saris too?
This is not a sari.
lt's a dream l carry in my mind.
Which was shattered
a long time ago.
Dreams,
like the waves on the seas...
...shatter on the rocks
of life's realities.
Okay, Mom. l'm going to office.
- Mom!
- Yes?
May l say something?
l can't bear to see you sad.
lf you wish to go back to Vijay...
...l won't mind.
l'll drop you there myself.
No, Ravi.
l'll stay here.
With you.
Didn't you always ask...
...who was my favourite?
l'll tell you today. l've always...
...loved Vijay more.
But my love is not blind.
lt can see...
...what good,
and what bad l've done.
Good evening, sir.
Ten minutes ago, cargo from the
ship has been sent in that godown.
Two minutes later 2
black trucks have gone in.
That means...
...the goods will leave
the godown in 5 minutes.
Damn it!
This telephone's dead!
Go and get more police.
But what will you do alone?
You don't even have your pistol.
We lost.
You better hurry while
l wait for you here.
Stay where you are.
We've surrounded this place.
lt'll be better,
if you surrender yourselves to us.
l don't want any blood shed.
Thus l've come here to arrest you.
Before l leave...
lf anyone tries to
leave this godown...
...he'll be rained with
bullets the moment he steps out!
So throw your pistols,
and stand in a line.
How do we know there are police?
Shankar, go and see.
Wait!
Why don't you see yourself?
Scared you might get shot?
Go! Open the door and see outside.
But if you get shot at, then, you'll
be responsible for your death!
Go!
l'll give you a minute
to think Are you ready...
...to be just arrested,
or do you want...
...to leave this place as wounded,
or as corpses?
Think it over.
We're ready to do whatever you say,
inspector.
Give me your pistol.
- Even you, quickly.
- Hurry up.
Get down! Come on.
- Shankar, Shankar.
- Come on, join them.
- So there are no police outside?
- lf not, they'll be here soon.
This too is that Ravi Verma's job!
This is his sixth raid!
Within 2 months too!
- lt's just too much.
- Davar, sir.
ln our field at times the
police win and other times, we win.
- This can't go on like this.
- But what about business?
l had promised these guys,
that l'd supply the stuff. But...
...thanks to Mr. Ravi Verma...
lf you can't supply the goods.
...give us our money back.
We can't wait any longer.
Mr. Mulchand.
lnspector Ravi Verma.
- Did you see that?
- lt's a simple matter, sir.
Bump off this police officer.
What do you say, Vijay?
What's the point in killing him?
Another will come.
But he may not be as
clever as this Ravi Verma.
True. All alone,
and without any gun on him...
...he caught my 8 men red-handed.
l still say, sir...
...send this officer to his Maker.
- keep the stupid advice to yourself.
Relax, Viiay relax.
He just said what came to him.
But he must think about
the consequences before speaking.
Every cop becomes a staunch
enemy of a person who kills a cop!
Vijay..
ls this the only reason why
you don't want him to be killed?
lsn't there any other reason?
- What are you getting at?
- What nonsense! What other reason?
Well, Vijay, isn't there
any other reason? Tell us.
Yes! He's my brother!
And if you ever talk about him,
l'll have your tongue!
Thank God! l thought you
would come even here, in uniform!
- l'm not late, am l?
- Never mind.
Those who travel by car,
are mostly late.
Do you know why l called
you to meet me here, Ravi?
lt's beneath you
to come to my house...
...and it's against my
principles to come to yours.
We could have only met elsewhere.
No, nowhere else, but here.
No matter how much
we may drift apart.
Our childhood can never
be separated from each other.
Today, when all the bridges
are broken between us...
...This was the only
one that remained.
This bridge...
under which we spent our childhood.
Right here.
Before l say anything, l'd like
to ask... This particular moment...
...who's listening to me?
A brother, or a police officer?
As long as a brother will speak,
a brother will listen.
When a criminal will speak,
a police officer will listen.
You've made a lot of foes here.
l stopped them today...
But tomorrow l may not be able to.
Take a transfer from here.
Go some place else.
ls the criminal, after discarding
the garb of a brother, saying this?
l think the wall between us,
is much higher than this bridge!
You don't know what the outcome
can be, of the path you tread.
The path l've taken,
its outcome may be terrible.
But the path that you tread,
leads to nothing but misery.
l've already played my card.
Now l may lose, or win.
But you still have the time.
Go to some other posting.
No. My principles and,
my ideals don't allow me.
Your principles and ideals!
Of what use are they?
All your ideals and principles
cannot feed you 2 meals.
Those ideals for which you're
ready to stake your life...
...what did they bring?
A Rs. 500/- worth of a job.
A hired quarter, and a jeep!
And this khaki uniform. Look at me.
l'm that same boy, and so are you.
We both had grown on this pavement.
But look where you've been
left and look where l've risen.
l've got real estate,
bungalows, a bank balance... a car.
What do you have?
l have Mom!
Hey, wake up. This is the last stop.
The train won't go further. Get up.
- Unknown? - What else can l say?
- The body was found in a train.
No sign of his name and nobody has
claimed the body. Thus, "unknown"
But he was in a train,
so he must be having some luggage.
This bundle with a few clothes.
And this photograph too.
The 3rd body is a woman,
Name Jamnabai. Age, 40.
You're not writing this down?
This body is not 'unclaimed'.
lt's not unclaimed.
ls that you?
How come you're early today?
Why are you standing?
Go change. There's no water today.
What could l have done, there
isn't a single drop of water..
..since the morning.
l couldn't even cook.
We'll have to eat the left-over's.
What a headache! l didn't
even light the stove today.
ls this how it should be?
A man should die of thirst?
Ravi!
- Mom...
- No! No, Ravi, No!
Don't say that, son.
Don't say that!
We've to do the final rites. Light
the pyre. Where's the elder son?
Vijay, what shall l say to you?
Your brother left you.
Your mother's angry with you.
Every time l told you...
don't grieve about it.
But today...
How can l say this to you today?
- What has happened with you today?
- Nothing has happened, Anita.
My father had died 20 years ago.
Today he was cremated, that's all.
May l tell you something Vijay?
Get this removed by plastic
surgery. Else you'll never forget.
lf someone erases the lines from
his palm, will it change his fate?
lt's not just on my arm,
but on my heart...
...mind and soul too.
From where, no plastic
surgery on earth can remove it.
This can never be erased. Never!
- Right then, Mom.
- You're leaving, son?
- Had you been to the doctor?
- When will l go? - That's it!
l don't like this negligence!
keep all this. Relax sometimes.
The worry which eroded the heart,
is no more.
Now it's nothing but rest for me.
- Here you are.
- l'll tell the doctor on my way.
- He'll come and examine you here.
- Who do you worry, son?
- Have those calls been taped?
- Yes. Come with me.
This is the copy of all
those calls made on these numbers.
- Are you sure no calls were missed?
- This tape-recorder is automatic.
Any call made on these numbers,
turns on this recorder.
- Who are these guys?
- Obviously not decent people.
Nowadays even the smugglers have no
work but to romance on the phone.
- Sir, you keep on trying.
- Okay sir.
Sir, just a minute.
- Jaichand?
- Yes.
Do you have the stuff?
- Yes.
- Okay. Exactly at 4:45...
...leave your hotel
Sun and Sea by your car.
- En route, at any crossing,
Dindayal's men... - 10 mins. Left.
Okay.
Don't move.
May l coming, sir?
- Come, Ravi.
- Jaichand has made a statement.
Very good.
l want warrants in the name of
Mr. Davar, and Vijay Verma.
Okay.
Mr. Davar.
l've a warrant in your name.
l see.
- Can l phone my lawyer?
- From the police-station.
Get the jeep.
lnform the D.C.P.
That l've picked up Davar.
Now l'm going to arrest Mr.
Vijay Verma.
Sub-inspector Verma here, yes.
No information as yet?
Highways, Railway. Stations, airport
keep a strict vigil on all these.
Vijay Verma must be holed
up somewhere in this city!
Okay.
So the police are very sure that
Vijay is hiding somewhere here.
That's what it says
in the papers at least.
The police must not get Vijay.
l must get him!
l had promised him.
He had started the game...
...but l'll finish it!
lf the police catch him...
...how will l keep my promise?
A very bad news, Vijay.
Mumbai's total police force, is
hounding me, what could be worse?
Your mother's very ill.
She's in the hospital.
l will go to meet mother.
There are police at every step.
You'll never reach the hospital.
Vijay.
Vijay!
How's your mother now?
Vira, sometimes there
comes a time in life...
...when one can't make out
what is right, and what is wrong.
Sometimes l wonder how
to get a son to see his mother.
But then l've also surrounded
this hospital with police so that,
lf Vijay Verma comes for his Mom,
he should be arrested at once.
You don't know, but in these veins
along with my father's blood...
...there flows my mother's milk,
and my brother's sweat too.
But after all this, is whatever
l'm doing, right? ls it correct?
Thousands of years ago,
Ariun had asked the same question..
And do you know what
krishna said to him?
l know, dear, l know.
But the one who heard the
Lord was none other than Arjun.
And l'm no Arjun, my dear.
lt's impossible for you
to reach the hospital. l think...
The police suspect you'll come
here. They've surrounded the place.
And Mom?
l had asked the nurse.
She's very serious.
And l can't go near my Mom!
There's no way, Vijay.
Mom always said,
when all the roads seem closed...
...there's only one way.
Today, l'll try that way and see.
Come on!
Anita, you wait here.
You must be very happy today.
Look!
The one who didn't climb
Your temple's steps till today...
Who didn't bow to You till now...
The one who never folded his hands
to You... is begging of You today.
You must be very happy
today Happy that today... l came.
But You know,
that as l stand here...
That woman, whose forehead
has worn out Your threshold...
That woman whose prayers
increased as her torments grew.
Who got wronged all her life, yet,
kept your lamp burning. That woman!
That woman stands between
life and death today.
And it's Your defeat! Yes!
lt's Your defeat!
What wrong has she done?
What sin, or crime has she done?
That she's my mother?
That she gave birth to me?
ls it her fault that l love her?
What crime is she
being punished for?
We became homeless.
My father became a living corpse.
My mother...
...became a widow, having a husband.
Yet l never asked anything from You.
But today...
l'm asking for something.
Don't punish my mother
for the crimes l committed.
l'm surrendering myself to You.
Do what You like with me; but...
Give my mother back to me.
Give me my mother.
Give my mother to me.
- Anita!
- Hmm.
My mother used to come
to this temple, every single day.
And we brothers used
to go our own way from here.
But that our paths
will differ so very much...
...l didn't know.
Before going home, son.
l'd like to go to the temple.
Okay, Mom.
- How are you now?
- Alright.
Your son had come here.
Not this one, the other one.
He asked God to keep you alive.
Your mother's fine, Vijay.
She's at home now.
- Mom is alright now? Really?
- Yes.
That's good news you brought.
- Now l don't have any worry.
- Yes. - Come on, have this.
C'mon! Cheers!
Cheers!
You carry on.
Won't you drink?
- l've stopped drinking.
- Why?
l'm going to be a mother.
The mother of your child.
But l won't force you to marry me.
Whatever may be...
l'll give birth to this baby.
And l'll try to give
such a life to my child...
...which, compared to my life,
and yours too...
...will be better!
l'll marry you, Anita.
Today. Right now.
After that l'll surrender
to the police. Yes, my dear.
lf we are to give a better
life to our child, then...
...l'll have to sacrifice this.
To make amends for my sins.
l don't want...
l don't want anyone to tattoo on my
son's arm, "His father's a thief."
What's this, Anita?
Oh...
How did tears flow today?
Come! We'll go to the temple.
Will you wait for some time?
l'll just dress up and come.
My mother had given me a sari.
Mother's no more, but that dream...
...is still with me even today.
May l go now?
Go, Anita. l'll wait for you.
Hello!
Who's speaking?
Mother!
Vijay!
How are you, Mom?
l'm coming to the temple, Mom.
l want your blessings.
After that it'll be as you say.
You will come to bless me?
Of course l'll come, son.
Most certainly.
Mom...
Mom... you...
- Where's he?
- Who?
The one who has 'kept' you.
- l don't know.
- Who's wanted by me and the police.
l don't know anything.
You don't know, eh?
lf you don't tell us...
...you'll die a terrible death!
Where is he?
- Everything's done.
- What's the time in your watch?
9 o'clock.
lt's very late.
The boat is hired and we'll
have to leave shortly from here.
By tomorrow, we'll be
miles away from this place.
You all go.
l've come very far as it is.
l'll have to go back now.
Anita!
Anita?
Anita!
Don't leave me and go, love.
l'll be all alone; so lonely.
Anita!
- Vijay.
- Yes, Anita.
We had thought of so
many things short time ago.
Our child. Our home.
- And now all our dreams are shattered.
No, my dear.
- Vijay!
- Yes.
- Hold me close to you.
- Yes, Anita.
- Closer, closer.
- Yes, Anita.
- Don't be scared.
- l won't, Vijay.
l won't let you die.
No l won't, Anita.
l had died... long ago, Vijay.
Today, it's kind of...
...a new birth for me.
- No... Just tell me who they were.
- Who were they, dear?
- l'm scared...
l'm scared what you might do.
Please, Anita. Please.
l told... them... nothing.
No, Anita... No!
No!
Anita!
Samant!
l want Samant. Where's he?
Giria palace, top floor.
What are you saying?
Are you sure it was Vijay Verma?
All this proves that he
went towards Samant's house.
We'll surround Samant's house.
Yes sir!
Sir l promise..
Today the police will
definitely catch Vijay Verma.
At any cost.
Yes, sir.
Today l want your strength
and your blessings, Mom.
May God not tremble your hand,
when you shoot.
You're going?
Yes. A woman has done her duty.
Now a mother is going
to wait for her son.
Who is it?
Who the hell are you?
You! Why are you here?
keep your distance,
l say Don't come near me.
No Vijay!
No! No Vijay!
No Vijay, no.
Go up wjth your men.
And you all, surround the building.
Viiay Verma..
The poljce have surrounded you.
You have no way to escape.
Surrender yourself to the police.
Surrender yourself.
Brother stop!
Brother!
Stop, brother. Else l'll shoot.

hand when you fire at him.
You'll come to bless me, Mom?
Of course l'll come, son.
