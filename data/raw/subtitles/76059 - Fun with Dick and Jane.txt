-I guess it does stink.
-lt stinks on ice!

It was a great feeling to be part of the

You don't get that feeling
from building a goddamn missile.
-Now, what's alI this crap?
-My plan to reorganize my department.
One smalI step.
One giant step for man kind.
I wou ld n't say that,
but it's not a bad plan.
You know who made that step possible?
We did.
You and me.
And Bob Kane, Frank Chapman.
We put Neil and what's h is name
on the bloody moon.
And then they gave us the shaft.
It sti nks.
On ice.
What do you say we talk turkey?
Right, Charlie.
I was thinking more i n terms

Gobble, gobble, gobble.
I was j ust tal ki ng tu rkey.

Then why me?
My d ivision's outperformed everybody's.

It real ly isn't as bad as it looks.
Noth i ng is as bad as this looks.
We don't have any i ncome
or any assets.
What do you mean,
we don't have any assets?
Other than the su n i n the morn i ng
and the moon at n ig ht.
We got this house.
We owe $ 77,000 on this house, Dick.
If you d ied Right now,

Out of the i nsu rance.
We don't have any.
You borrowed agai nst it.
Right, Right, Right. I forgot.

I' m not gon na d ie ton ig ht.
The n ig ht is you ng.
It's comforti ng to know

You've been leading a secret life
for these last years.
For exam ple, what are
" i nsecu red m u n ici pal debentu res"?
I don't know. I gam bled on a few th i ngs
for us, and I lost. I' m sorry.
You gam bled. You lost.
What about me?
I gam bled and lost, and I did n't
even get a chance to play.
I did n't even watch.
You r i nterest i n econom ics
was I i m ited to the spend i ng part.
I always thoug ht of you as
a responsi ble aerospace executive.
Who wou ld have known you were
the Typhoid Mary of h ig h fi nance.
If I'd have consu lted you,
I wou ld n't have lost my job.
If you th i n k you can do better,
take over.
It wou ld be hard
to do it any worse.
Go ahead, be my g uest.
It's alI you rs.
My very thoug ht.
And my fi rst act as d i rector
of fam i ly econom ics...
-... is to put you on an al lowance.
-On a what?
What kind of I u natic spends $ 1 000 on
I u nch when he's out of a job and i n debt?
The kind that knows you can't
get a job if you look I i ke a loser.
If I was Di ners Cl u b, I'd bronze you r
stomach and put it i n the halI of fame.
Poi nt n u m ber two.
You r job is to get on the food stam p
prog ram, look for work i n you r field--
Excuse me, why don't I get a "job" job?
Li ke a busboy or a waiter?
If we' re not too proud
to go on welfare--
-W e can't afford it.
-Can't afford it?
You earn more money on u nem ployment
than you cou ld i n any of those jobs.
My job is to get a "job" job.
-You' re gon na get a job?
-Y es. I ncred i ble as it may seem.
May I ask-- No offense, m i nd you.
What do you th i n k you' re q ualIfied to do?
Secretary of the treasu ry
seems to be fil led.
-There m ust be lots of th i ngs I can do.
-You never worked a day i n you r I ife.
You can't type,
and you can't take shorthand.
I' m a col lege g rad uate.
Reasonably i ntel I igent.
Not altogether u nattractive.
Y es, but wi I l you be happy
bei ng a hooker?
The on ly jobs you consider me
q ualIfied for are secretary and hooker.
You' re not q ualIfied to be a secretary.
What an i nterview.
Don't take it too hard, honey.
It's on ly the fi rst ti me.
T ake it too hard?
I start on Monday.
That's wonderfu l.
-The I i ne ends after me, m ister.
-Sorry.

Why do I have to see the su pervisor?
It's alI so si m ple.
I' m sorry.

I've seen some fru its i n my day,
but he real ly takes the cake, h u h?
Not real ly.
Come on. That's the flam i ngest
faggot I've ever seen.
I n the fi rst place, he's a transsexual.
Not a fru it, not a fag,
not even a homosexual.
He has the m i nd, sou I and desi res
of a woman i m prisoned i n a man's body.
Now, what can I do for you, si r?
-Than k you.
-Oh, God.
Good n ig ht.
Do you resent it that I got a job?

You shou ld n't feel th reatened--
Look, I don't resent you getti ng a job.

Or maybe, now that you've conq uered

I thoug ht you were goi ng today

Jane, you j ust don't get food stam ps.
You don't come i n off the street

They pay us i n cash. There's no papers.
No way they' re gon na fi nd out.

Hey, hey! A welfare ch iseler is j ust

We wan na work.
Y eah, but the ru les say you can't

You can't always go by the ru les.

You know?
How about g uys

No u nem ployment for th ree years.
I can't bel ieve it.
Look on the positive side.
They cou ld have sent you to jai l.
U nem ployment's the on ly th i ng we had.
What am I gon na tel I Jane?
I wou ld n't tel I her.
-Hel lo, dear.
-H i, Mom, how are you?
We' re just fine, dear.
It's so nice to see you.
How thoughtful of you.
Well, your father's waiting to see you.
-Hi, Dad.
-Jane brought us some flowers, dear.
Hello, Jane.
-Would you like a cup of tea, dear?
-No, thanks, Mom.
Over here.
I discussed your phone call with your
mother yesterday, after I hung up.
"What does she want to see us about?"
-Did n't I say that, Mother?
-Y es.
Someth i ng you cou ld n't d iscuss
over the phone, you said.
-Y es. That's Right, Dad. I--
-Wel l...
... I narrowed it down
to th ree possi bi I ities :
Health, emotion or money.
Let's take health.
Is there someone i I l?
No, I ru led that out myself.
I d isti nctly remem ber aski ng...
...about everyone's health,
and you r answer was positive.
Without hesitation.
Wh ich bri ngs us to...
...emotion.
At you r age, a eu phem ism for d ivorce.
Wel l, you never came to see us
to tal k about marryi ng h i m...
...so why shou ld you come
to tal k about d ivorci ng h i m?
No, a d ivorce can be hand led
i n a phone cal l.
So...
... it's money.
You' re broke. That's it, isn't it?
Who ever said S herlock Hol mes
was dead, eh, Mom?
I was right, Mother, they' re broke.
Dick hasn't had a job in
over three months, Dad.
Why didn't you tel I us before, dear?
We were su re he could get a job
and didn't want to worry you.
I unloaded my aerospace stock the day
they landed on the moon. I knew...
...that was the peak.
I was Right.
It's a depressed i nd ustry.
Depressed and depressi ng.
-I was Right about the stocks.
-You certai n ly were.
Jane...
... I' I l make it easier for you.
You've come here to borrow
money, haven't you?
Y es, Dad.

Bye-bye.

I know why you' re here.
You got g uts. I' I l g ive you that.
You r ad says, " If you've been

It did n't say "everywhere."
-It's the fi rst place we've been!

Hey, there are lots of places we

S it down. Did I say I wasn't

You have some jewel ry.

Sorry.
Mr. Harper? How much did you
tell them that you lost?
$ 1 000. What do you mean?
You couldn't tell them $2000?
Insurance would have paid. I would have
split the extra grand with you. Schmuck.
-Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
-Billy, are you going outside?
Y eah.
-Hi, Bill.
-Hi.
Are you feeling all right?
Come in and close the door.
Lock it.
They dropped it, I fell on it, and while the
police chased them I put it in my bag.
Oh, my God!
I don't know what happened to me.
I just did it.
-There's 2000 dollars here.
-I can't believe I did it.
-Neither can l.
-It's not funny. I've committed a crime.
And done a hell of a job at it.
Why didn't I give it back?
It never occurred
to me to give it back.
-You' re sensational.
-I can't believe it. Stop it, Dick.
Would you turn on the faucet?
-l' m going to give it back.
-T o who, the robbers?
The money belongs to the loan....
-They have insurance, don't they?
-Exactly.
S u ppose they catch those g uys.
They saw me.
They' I l never catch them. Even if they

The cops won't bel ieve them.
They' I l th i n k they spent it al l.
I can't bel ieve we' re tal ki ng I i ke this.

Screw it u p for others who need it.

Jane, the old rich are

The old poor have to stick

-We, i n this case, are the nouveau poor.
-We real ly need it.
No one i n this house or i n
this neig h borhood needs it.
Real ly? You th i n k we shou ld sel l

We should sell before the bank does.

-With what?
You have accepted ou r cu rrent

Cri m i nals leave cl ues.
They have a com pu lsion to confess.
I have a com pu lsion to pay the mortgage.
Did F reud write about that? No.

You have to remem ber
that God is i n you.
And i n you and i n you
and i n you and i n me.
Now, if you open u p you r heart
and you let God i nside...
-... he wi I l make you rich.

Let me rem i nd you
that the cross is a pl us sign.
Now, I want you all to repeat after me :
Money loves me.
-Money loves me.
-Money loves to be i n my pocket.
-Money loves to be i n my pocket.
-I see a whole mou ntai n...
...of money com i ng towards me.
I see a mou ntai n of money

Now, I want you alI to donate generously
to the m i n istry today. And remem ber...
...that every dol lar you g ive,
God wi I l pay back tenfold...
... i n some wond rous
and mysterious and exciti ng way.
A car, a boat, a plane, a home.
J ust one other cou ple, Dr. Wil l.
Y ea, I say u nto you : Bri ng them i n,

-I nspi rational sermon, doctor.
-Than k you, than k you.
Y es, particu larly the part about
not feeling g u i lty about prosperi ng.
Wel l, you see,
that is cal led "Say ' I am."'
If you want more money, you m ust get
an expandedidea of you rself.
You m ust th i n k of you rself
as one who has more money.
We' re tryi ng, doctor.
Wel l, go ahead. T ouch it, son.
Don't be afraid. Go on.
Go ahead, dear, touch it.
Go on. That's it, touch it some more.
You see, you must take the limit
off you r fi nancial thinking...
...and you will get more money.
Don't worry about how.
-lnspirational.
-Say " I am."
Stick them up.
Did I hear you right, sinner?
You holding me up?
I am. Hands on your head, both of you.
-Move!
-Will you get out of the way?
-God wants you out of the way!

Wou ld you m i nd

T esting. T esting.
Oh, Jesus!
-You alI Right?
-Y eah, I th i n k so.
Pull over, you sinners!
They are thieves, stop them!
They have stolen all my--
The Lord's money.
-Oh, n o!
-G od!
If you pull over a t the next light,
God will forgive you.
-He is no stool pigeon.
-O h, my G od!
God does not hold a grudge.
Remember, thou shalt not steal.
T h ey' re co m i n g c I ose r to u s, D i c k.
Tha t is the fourth--
Tha t's one of them commandments.
Give me back my
goddamn money, will you?
Step on it. Can 't you get more
juice out of this goddamn thing?
Wa tch out! Jesus Christ!
You almost broke my ass, you fool.
