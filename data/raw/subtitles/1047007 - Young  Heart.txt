Darling, you've gotta let me know
[ Continues ]
Should I stay or should I go
I fyou say that you'll be mine
I 'll be yours till the end of time
But you've gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go
[ Stephen ] "Should I Stay OrShould I Go?"
That's a punk song, isn't it?
I would say so.
Shit.
Did you-
Have you ever heard it before?
Always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I 'm on my knees
One day's fair, the other's black
So ifyou want me offyour back
Then you've gotta let me know
Should I stay or should I go
Should I stay or should I go now

Billed as "Seniors Behaving Badly"..
Young A t Heart
is a chorus like no other.
With an average age of 80...
their renditions ofsongs
from the likes of Outkas t...
Radiohead,Jimi Hendrix
and The Clash...
have won them sensational reviews
all over the world.
So com e on and I et m e know
Can you think ofany other names ofpeople
who sing those songs thatyou sing?
Wel l, the Beatles.
We have sung some of thei rs.
Rol I i ng Stones,
they've come i nto it.
And the, um-
Oh, a more recent one.
Uh, Crash?
Should I stay or should I go now
[ Stephen Narrating]
I first saw the chorus in London ayear ago...
and was instantly hooked.
Now I'm in America to spend
the next seven weeks filming them...
as they prepare to put on a new show.
In the process, I find myself
acquiring 2 4 new grandparents...
except they're nothing like
any grandparents I've ever seen.
Shoul d I stay or shoul d I go
[ Laughing, Cheering, Applause ]
Thank you!
Thank you.
[ Stephen Narrating ]
It's a Thursday afternoon...
in the chorus 's hometown
ofNorthampton, Massachusetts...
and the first day ofrehearsals
for the new show...
which they'll perform
in just seven weeks ' time.
[ Chattering ]
[ Man ]
Hello!
Charm i ng stuff.
But i n New Orleans they' re sti I l-
[ Exhales ]
- Did you bri ng any booze with you?
- No.
I t's i n here. I t's i n here.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Stephen Narrating ]
The chorus 's director, Bob Cilman...
started Young A t Heart
back in 1 982...
with a group ofseniors performing
old vaudeville numbers at a meal center.
One night, an 84-year-old called
Diamond Lil stood up in the middle ofa show...
and did a version of
Manfred Mann 's "Do Wah Diddy"..
which brought the house down.
Things were never the same again.
Good afternoon.
I s everybody happy you' re al I here?
- [ Cheering, Chattering ]
- I 'd I i ke to thank you al l
for showi ng up on ti me.
That was very cool.
Very cool.
Fi rst thing we gotta do,
and it's really important today...
is wish Jack Schnepp happy birthday.
- So, uh-
- [ Cheering, Applause ]
[ Man ]
All right,Jack!
It's a speciallygreat
birthday forJack today...
'cause whileJack is sitting here...
we have the possibility that
he 'll pass a kidney stone for us...
which is just-
[ Men Chattering, Indistinct ]
Is there any other medical issues
that people wanna reveal here today?
U h, no.
Anybody havi ng a baby?
Wel l, J ack, good I uck.
There's about seven or so new songs
that I wanna take a look at.
I 'd I i ke to get through
three of them today. All right?
- Whoa!
- No problem.
[ Stephen Narrating]
Just as I'm beginning to think...
this is going to be some sort
ofgentle afternoon sing-along...
Bob pitches the chorus straight into
the first new song for the show...
a track called "Schizophrenia "
by punk band Sonic Youth.
[ Bob ] Billy, listen to this.
This has got a lot ofgood drum stuff.
-  [ Drum s ]
- "Schizophrenia."
Whoo!
[ Guitar, Drums ]
[ Stephen ] What kind ofreaction do you
thinkyou're gonna get to "Schizophrenia "?
I thi nk that the words
wi I l be tricky at fi rst.
And these guys real ly are
i n tune with the words.
What's great about this group is that
you really hear the words when they sing it.
- Doyou think they're gonna like it?
- No.
I went away
To see an old friend ofmine
His sister came over
She was out ofher mind
- [ Stephen ] So, what kind ofmusic do you like?
- Classical.
With opera at the top.
-  [ Continues ]
-  Her I i ght eyes were danci ng
She is i nsane
My m usic?
Uh, classical music.
And ifyou look at
the top of my TV set...
you'll see a schedule of the
Metropolitan Opera broadcasts.
[ Continues ]
Of course, I like My Fair Lady
and The King And I...
and, um-
What's the very popular one
with J ulie Andrews?
"Climb Every Mountain."
What was that one?
- Sound Of Music.
- Yes.
[ Continues, Loud]
-  [ Ends ]
- [ Bob ] We're gonna-
We're gonna feature Billy on this.
What do you think?
- [ Men, Women Exclaiming ]
- [ Bob ] You can 't hear what?
The words. Because of the m usic.
The m usic was too loud.
I 'm always excited
to start new work.
I t's one of my favorite
parts of the process.
I think it's that moment
where they don't trust you at all.
They think that
this is a crazy idea...
and it's gonna backfire completely.
And then they start
to warm up to it.
There is something wonderful
about that whole process.
- Wow!  I feel good
- [All Laughing]
I knew that I would now
[ Stephen Narrating ] Next on Bob's list
ofnew songs is James Brown...
and it's a whole different story.
So good, so good
I gotyou 
[ Screams ]
-  [ Continues ]
- Whoo!
- [ Bob ] Come on! That's your part!
- Whoo!
Okay, Bob!
Let's hear it now!
[James Brown ]
 When I holdyou in my arms
I know that
I can 't do no wrong
And when I holdyou in my arms
My love won 't do you no harm
U m, I wanna see Stan and Dora
here for a second.
[ Woman ]
All right!
[ Stephen Narrating ] Bob kicks offwith
an incongruous pairing for "I Feel Good"-
Stan Goldman, a 76-year-old suffering
from an extremely painful spinal condition...
and Dora Morrow, an 83-year-old
great-great-grandmother.
You do the "wow"
and " I feel good" for a second.
Okay?
"Wow! I feel good."
And then I 'm gonna want you
to do the "l i ke I knew I would."
Okay? And then I 'm gonna-
Let's- [ Chuckles ]
Oy.
- Whoo!
-  [ Snare Drum Hit ]
Whoo!
 I feel good
-  [ Piano, Drums ]
-  Like I knew I would
Okay, you gotta get
the rhythm though.
- I t's, "Wow! I feel good."
-  [ Piano ]
Li ke I knew that I would
And yours is just-
 Li ke I knew that I would
- Can you do that?
 Like I knew that I would 
-  Like I knew that I would
- You know what? [ Chuckles ]
But you know what?
- [ Singers Complaining ]
Let's just get the music
and forget the face for a second.
Like I knew that I would
Like I knew that I would
Like I knew that I would
Like I knew that I would
Okay, so, Dora, oww!
I feel good.
Ow!
 I feel good
-  Like I knew that-
- No, no, no, no!
[ Bob Humming ]
Oh, man, this is gonna be
such a pain in my backside.
[ Laughing ]
Oh, God.
Oww!
-  I feel good 
- N i ce!
I ' m sorry.
I - Let m e do i t-
That was a perfect "oww!"
And you can come i n any ti me you want.
- Do your "oww!" agai n one more ti me.
- Give me the "oww!"
Oww!
- You know what? This is gonna be excellent!
- [ Laughing]
- But it may not be till the year 2009!
- [ Laughing Continues ]
This is-
[ Laughing ]
[ Stephen ]
What doyou think ofthe song?
It's all right. It's got-
It's got some, uh, juice to it.
Didyou put some earplugs
inyour ears?
Yeah, well, only bits of tissue is what.
[ Laughs ]
- Whoo!
- Oh, see? She's-
It's in her bones already.
She's getting it.
[ Stephen Narrating] The next morning
I start my rounds ofthe chorus...
beginning with the oldest member,
Eileen Hall.
She joined Young A t Heart at the age of70
when one ofher star turns was a striptease...
an act she performed with great success
for the next 20 years.
[ Stephen ]
How old are you, Eileen?
N ow? 9 2.
I t's funny, i sn't it?
[ Laughi ng ]
U m, n-no, I 've had a good I ife though.
Very good I ife.
Can you believe you're 92?
Ye- No!
No, I tel I people I 'm 2 9.
That'll do.
- Youjust switch the numbers round?
-J ust switch the numbers round.
Let's go intoyour bedroom, shall we?
Can we do that?
- Oh, shall we cut there?
- Sure!
[ Laughing ]
- What an invitation!
- Oh, gosh! What have I done?
Here I 've got, what, three or four men?
[ Laughing ]
- Oh, my goodness.
- Shall I askyou that again?
Yes.
Shall we go intoyour bedroom?
All ofus?
Yes, all of us. Come on, boys.
[ Laughs ]
- I could come as close to you-
- No, no, it's fine.
[ Laughing ]
You're getting a bit close here, Eileen.
Yes. I've gotta shut up, haven't I?
[ Laughs ]
- Getting a little intimate here.
- Gotta be careful.
All of these men around.
- Don't get nervous till I-
- You're a bit ofa flirt, aren'tyou?
Don't get nervous till I start taking
something off. You're all right until then.
- You're a bit ofa flirt, Eileen.
- Am I?
Wereyou always, or is that something
that's happened since you got to 90?
No, I was rather shy.
- Really?
- Yes. Very shy.
You don 't strike me
as being shy at all.
No, I don't stri ke anybody that way.
But I was a very shy chi ld.
Miserable kid, really.
[ Stephen Narrating ]
For the past three years, Eileen has lived...
at the Arbors Nursing Home,
about 20 miles from Northampton.
As well as being
one of the oldest residents...
she 's also the only one to possess
her own key to the front door...
since she often gets back from
late-night gigs with the chorus...
well after all the staff
have gone to bed.
- I ' I l see you, ki d.
- T ake care.
See- Our show.
Bye-bye.
-  [ Rock ]
- Thank you!
Enjoyyour afternoon.

Now is the time for all good men
To get together with one another
[ Stephen Narrating ]
With just six weeks to go before the show...
the chorus 's director, Bob Cilman,
has stepped up rehearsals...
from one to three times a week.
Despite lots ofgrumbling in the ranks,
everybody s till turns up.
[ Man ]
How do you feel, Stan?
[ Man Laughing ]
-  [ Continues ]
- This afternoon they get their
firs t s tab at the next new song...
an R&B track by Allen Toussaint
called "Yes, We Can Can. "
Gosh almighty, yes, we can
I know we can can
H om e agai n.
One, two, three, four, one.
I know we can make it
I know that we can
I know darn wel l
we can work it out
Oh, yes, we can
I know we can can
Yes, we can can, why can't we
ifwe wanna, yes, we can
[ Stephen Narrating] It rapidly becomes clear
that this is one ofthose songs...
that's going to drive everybody insane
over the next few weeks.
- For one thing, the word "can "
crops up no less than 7 1 times.
-  I know we can can
I wa nt you guys to si ng-
 Oh, yes, we can, I know we can can
Y es, we can can, why can't we if we wanna
Yes, we can can
Andyou're gonna respond-
 Oh, yes, we can, I know we can
- Yes, we can, great gosh almighty
yes, we can, I know -
The thing that you do
by yourselves earlier.
So on the third one
it's call and response. Okay?
I will write this all down.
- - I know we can make it -
- - I know that we can -
- I know we can make it ifwe try -
- I know we can
I know we can can -
[ Stephen Narrating ] To cope with a song which
sounds like an extended tongue twister...
Bob picks three ofhis most
reliable singers for the solos...
includingJoe, who 's famous for memorizing
entire songs in an afternoon.
- Why can 't we ifwe wanna
Yes, we can can -
- Oh, yes, we can, I know we can can
Y es, we can can -
- Great gosh al m i ghty
Yes, we can, I know we can can --
- Whoo!
- [ Chattering ]
I love this rehearsi ng.
No, I think, uh, singing
does a lot foryour whole body.
Your lungs and everything.
I love it.
Everybody take out "Schizophrenia."
Where'd Eileen go?
[ Stephen ] Up next is the song which seems
to me by far the craziest ofBob's ideas.
How he's going to get the chorus to make
sense ofsuch a weird track, I've no idea.
But one thing's for sure- they all hated
"Schizophrenia " from the word "go "...
and still do.
- My future i s stati c -
[ Bob ] Okay, I don 't needyou
to make fun of the song, so if-
- I don't know where i t goes!
- It's just said.
We used to si ng thi ngs I i ke
"Yes, We Have No Bananas"...
and, uh, " Honey Bun."
Even with Bob-
He would pick those and-
- Yabba-yabba-yabba
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-dat dat-dat-dat-dah -
I doubt you remember that. It was
too far back for you. [ Chuckling ]
I want you to talk to each other here.
J ust say these lines to each other.
Okay, so it's- My- Don't worry about the-
J ust talk to each other.
My future is static.
- It's already had it.
- Okay, talk to each other.
Soyou say, "My future is static. "
- I had a dream -
- - And it split the scene -
- -- [ Bob Singing Along ]
- But I got a hunch -
- - I t's com i ng back to me -
- -- [ Continues ]
You can do that with her.
- I t's com i ng back to -
- Me -
- I'm gonna letyou have that, actually.
- Oh, a note!
- A note!
- Okay, shh! Yeah.
- U m, J oe and Lenny.
- Yeah?
I want you to work on
" Life Duri ng Warti me."
I t's goi ng to be a conversation
between the two ofyou.
[ Narrator]
As a big Talking Heads fan...
Bob has decided to try out the song
"Life During Wartime " for the show...
which he 's giving to Joe
and his best friend Lenny.
J oe, you' re gonna be si ngi ng...
- Heard of a van that
is loaded with weapons -
[ Narrator]
Joe is a phenomenon in the chorus...
an 83-year-old who went through
six bouts ofchemotherapy...
before ignoring
his doctor's advice...
to join the most
recent tour to Europe.
[ Bob ] Do you have those CDs?
I'd like you to listen to them.
I s thi s the one that we- That's the one that-
the side that plays, ri ght?
- What?
- I s this the side that plays?
- Yes! [ Laughing ]
- This is the side, right?
The one that says " New Music" on it.
This is the side that plays.
I don't think so.
It's this side.
- When you put it in the, uh-
in the, uh, CD player-
- You put this side up.
Oh, I thought it was
this side that played.
- No, I think it plays with this side.
- Oh, boy.
I'm not familiar
with the electronics.
- [ Lenny ] - I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy -
- -- [Joe Whistling Along ]
- A Yankee Doodle do or die -
- A real, live nephew
of my Uncle Sam -
- Born on the Fourth ofJ uly -
[ Stephen Narrating]
Everyweek for the past decade...
Lenny,Joe and Eileen have traveled
to and from rehearsals together.
A great friendship
has grown up between them.
They call themselves
the Three Musketeers.
- I am a Yankee Doodle boy --
- Shou I d I g ive i t the gas?
- When you' re a star, everybody wants you. Ri ght?
- [ Siren Wailing ]
- Oh, boy.
[ Stephen Narrating ] Since Lenny,
an ex- World War II pilot...
is the only one ofthem that can
actually see properly, he gets to drive...
an activity he performs
with great gusto.
- [Joe ] Lenny, they knewyou were coming.
- [ Lenny Laughing ]
They got me.
I thought they would eventually.
- [ Tires Screeching ]
- [ Stephen ] Those are tight turns
you're doing there, Lenny.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.
- Those are some tight turns.
- [Joe ] I toldyou he was a good driver.
[ Stephen ] You're gonna have me through
the window in a second at this rate.
[ Eileen ] The wayyou drive, Lenny,
we 've got it made.
I ' m not goi ng any faster than I usual ly go.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Eileen ] No. We don 't needyou to.
You're a good, confident driver.
[Joe ]
He 's got good brakes on this.
We used them just about an hour ago.
- [ Stephen ] What happened?
- Goi ng through a red I i ght.
[ Laughi ng ]
[ No Audi ble Dialogue ]
[ Stephen Narrating ]
The following morning...
I drop in on Stan to see how he's
getting on with "I Feel Good"...
a song which, by all accounts,
he seems to have really taken to heart.
- I feel ni ce -
- Li ke sugar and spice -
-- [ Conti nues ]
- So nice, so nice -
- I 've got you -
- - Yeah --
- -- [ Ends ]
[ Stephen Laughing ]
So, do you thinkyou're in tune?
[ Clears Throat ]
Wel l, you tell me.
- -- [ Snare Drum Hit ]
- - I feel good -
- Nice. Nice.
- [ Chattering ]
- - Li ke I know I should -
- Nice! Nice! Sugar and spice.
- I feel good -
N ice! No, you see-
I thi nk he's thi nks I 'm tel I i ng hi m "nice."
"I feel nice. " Okay.
You caught me on a roll.
No, it's "I feel nice. "
[ Narrator]
"I Feel Good" is rapidly shaping up...
to be one ofBob's
biggest headaches.
Stan 's got the rhythm
but can 't get the words.
- Dora knows the words but can 't get the rhythm.
- You have the " I got you."
- I feel good -
[ Bob ]
- So good -
- - I need -
- Whoo!
[ Laughi ng ]
[ Bob ]
It's "So good, so good, I gotyou. "
I got you. Here, you can have that.
Ready? That was so close.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
[ Man ] What doyou love
about Young A t Heart?
- Or do you love-
- Oh, I do! I do. I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
Uh, I mean, this-
And this goes back to way before
we even started going to Europe.
I mean, that's a- that's icing on the cake,
but the cake was there before.
You forget all about...
the creaky bones and...
the knee, the hips,
the shoulders, the fingers.
- Shakespeare's sonnets.
- [ Stephen ] You're a bit ofa
culture vulture, aren'tyou?
I guess you could
call me a culture vulture.
So what areyou doing singing punk songs
and rock songs and God knows what?
Wel l, I 'm tryi ng to-
[ Laughs ]
I don't know if this will do it,
but I 'm trying to expand my horizons.
I t's kind of fun when you blend together
and you make that big sound.
Sort of makes you
feel good to be part of it.
What a nice bunch of people they are.
You know?
And I say to myself,
they are a caring group of people...
including our director, Bob Cilman.
It's, um, all keeping
your brain going, you know.
It's true-
Ifyou don't use it, you lose it.
[ Sneezes ]
- [ Woman ] Bless you.
- Excuse me. Thankyou.
That's the first blessing I get today.
[ Laughs ]
[ Stephen Narrating ]
Bob has come up with the idea...
ofbringing back two former members
ofthe chorus for the show.
Both ofthem had to leave
because of ill health.
His plan is to give them the Coldplay song
"Fix You" to sing as a duet.
Today I'm off to meet Fred Knittle,
a colorful personality in the chorus...
until a heart attack five years ago
forced him to stop.
- An old cowpoke went riding out
one dark and windy day -
- Upon the trail he res ted
as he went along his way -
- When al I at once a m i ghty herd
of red-eyed cows he saw -
- A-ridi n' through the ragged sky -
- And up a cloudy draw -
- Yi ppee-yi-ay
Yi ppee-yi-oh -
- Ghost riders in the sky --
That was the song that we sang
that started the show off.
That seemed to go over pretty well.
We did that all over Europe.
We went from continent to continent
until I became incontinent...
and then we didn't go any further.
There's something about Fred's personality
onstage that makes it all work.
You know, he's-
he's really got this- this charm...
th-th-that comes out of him
when he sings.
And so he's a- You know,
he's- he's pretty magnetic.
[ Stephen ]
Why doyou need the oxygen?
I have congestive heart failure...
and it builds up fluids
in the lungs, in the legs.
Um, and so the lungs,
when it's filled with fluid...
you have to have a supplement...
and that's what the oxygen is for-
to replace the space
that I don't have anymore.
That's from years of smoking
and carousing and so forth.
- A lot ofcarousing, huh?
- A lot of carousing. Right.
Bob Cilman says I have
a high and a low voice.
Um, the high is for ballads
and things like that...
and then occasionally
he'll want me to do a low voice.
- Um-
- How low canyou go?
Well-
- Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep -
- So beware -
[ Pitch Lowers ]
- Be-e-e-e-ware -
- [ Stephen Laughing]
- A little bit. I get it down there.
Again, it all depends
how loose my shorts are.
[ Narrator] Fred's partner
in the new song is Bob Salvini...
whose solo of"Every Breath You Take"
where he played a nurse...
was one ofthe highlights
of the chorus back in the '90s.
[ Bob ]
- Every breath you take -
- Every move you make -
- -- [ Continues ]
- [ Stephen ] Fouryears ago, at the age of7 1...
Bob developed spinal meningitis.
Within hours his condition
had worsened so rapidly...
that a priest was called in
to deliver the last rites.
[ Bob ]
- I'll be watchingyou -
[ Stephen ]
How close were you to dying?
Oh, very cl ose.
I wasn't supposed to I ive.
The doctor told her, i n so many words,
he's probably gonna die.
Boy, it sounded so bleak.
I had-
It was shocking to me that he made it back
from what he went through.
He really sounded like
he was on the verge of death.
And, you know, he has never
come back to us since then.
From that point on it was hell.
I couldn't see. I couldn't hear.
I couldn't talk.
I didn't know anybody.
I didn't know my wife.
I didn't know my children-
for months.
I took him to the local hospital here.
While he was in there-
It was three days-
he did nothing but sing
day and night.
I mean, the top of his lungs,
day and night.
The doctors would laugh, and the nurses-
they'd say, "He's still in there singing."
They felt they could not do anything
for him there, so they sent him to a-
- [ Laughing ]
- to Dartmouth Hitchcock up in New Hampshire.
- What was he singing?
- Everything.
Everything from Young At Heart chorus.
He was singing "Golden Years."
- Golden years, bwop-bwop-bwop -
Laying in the bed, singing.
That was the thing about it-
His state of mind- He would say things
that were actually really, really funny...
almost acting as ifhe was on stage.
He was so sick, and that was really
what was causing him to do those things...
but it was so much
in his personality.
Bob Cilman came in and he said...
"You sang every song that we did on the tour
in chorus in the emergency room...
and it's the first time
you didn't make any mistakes."
[ Laughing ]
[ Stephen Narrating]
For the next fouryears...
Bob's life revolved
around hospitals.
Only recently has he been well enough for
Bob Cilman to consider bringing him back.
But he has never sung
since he firs t became ill.
What if it doesn 't work out
andyou jus t can 't find that voice again?
- How's that gonna be?
- Ah.
Devastati ng.
Y eah.

[ With Chorus ]
- The lights will guide -
- You home -
- And ignite -
- Your bones -
- I will try -
- To fix you --
It's great to see guys like that
not give up and come back.
I think that's a really cool thing.
'Cause they spent so much time doing this,
and they didn't want to stop doing it.
It was just health that
made it impossible for them.
[ Cheering, Applause ]
Thankyou.
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Whoo!
[ Stephen ]
Fred, how was that?
It was fun. I-
I didn't run out of air!
It's gonna take a little work.
I should really sing that an octave higher,
what I used to do.
But I- We'll put it together.
- Doyou like the song?
- Yes. Beautiful.
So, what's it like to be back?
Wonderful. It's like
being back in the saddle.
Back in the saddle again.

[ Stephen Narrating ]
It's five weeks before the show...
and at great personal risk
I'm letting Lenny drive me to rehearsal.
- [ Chorus ] - Ah, ohh -
- -- [ Continues ]
Everybody loves Lenny...
despite his tendency to go suddenly blank
in the middle of"Purple Haze "...
his one solo with the chorus...
a factor which makes each performance
a nail-biting experience.
- Purpl e haze
al I i n my brai n -
[ Woman ]
- Lately things just don 't seem the same -
- [ Bob ] Oh!
- Oh, boy.
-- [ Ends ]
[ Stephen ] Give me a breakdown of
the different things you do in the week.
[ Lenny]
Tuesday, as you know, we have rehearsal.
And, uh, Wednesday
I 've got, uh, the cl ub bi ke ride.
This is a T rek.
I t's an American-bui It bicycle...
and it's held up
a pretty darn good reputation...
for avoiding repairs.
And they even have club rides
on every Sunday.
But I don't go on that
because I sing in the choir.
- All the earth proclaim the Lord -
- Sing your praise to God --
[ Stephen ]
What about the Harmonicats?
Oh, yeah.
[ Chuckles ]
- J ust because you think
you're so pretty -
- J ust because
you think you're so hot -
- J ust because you think
you've got something -
- That nobody else has got --
Overhere, okay?
Here we go.
[ Man ]
Right from the top?
[ Stephen Narrating ]
Over the past few days...
the chorus have been hard at work
on all the new songs...
though it's anybody's guess which ones
will be ready in time for the show.
This afternoon Lenny andJoe get their
first crack at "Life During Wartime. "
- Heard ofa van
that's loaded with weapons -
- Packed up and ready to go -
[ Bob ]
Get ready down here.
- Heard ofsome gravesides
down by the highway -
- A pl ace where nobody knows -
- The sound of gunfi re
off i n the distance -
- I 'm getti n' used to it now -
- Lived in a brownstone -
- Lived i n a ghetto -
- I lived all over this town -
Yeah, you know what was
really interesting?
J oe's take on " Life During Wartime."
That was really incredible.
He just came out and nailed it.
- High on a hillside
trucks are loaded -
- Everything's ready to go -
Nice!
Yeah! Nice!
- - I sleep in the daytime -
- [ Chorus ]- I work in the nighttime -
[Joe ]
- I might not even go home --
Boom.
That was a revelation.
That happens a lot with this group.
You're thinking
about other things...
and you try something you don't think has a
chance, but you figure you might as well do it.
That was really something for the first time.
I really liked it.
- Now is the time -
[ Grunts ]
- [ Chorus Grunts ]
- [ Stephen ]
Bob's optimism comes crashing down...
with the next song,
"Yes, We Can Can. "
Apart from Joe,
who knows it offby heart...
nobody in the chorus has yet managed
to get their heads round all 7 1 "can "s.
- And try to fi nd peace wi thi n -
- Without steppi n' on one another -
Those words are hard
to put together.
"I thi nk I can, I think I can,
I think I can-can-can"? That's hard!
- I know darn well
we can work it out -
- Oh, yes, we can, I know we can can
Yes, we can -
- Oh, gosh almighty, yes, we can
Oh, yes, we can can -
"Oh, yes, we can.
"I know we can can.
Yes, we can."
[ Laughs ]
- Oh, yes, we can, I know we can can
Yes, we can can -
- Why can't we ifwe wanna
Yes, we can can -
- [ Stephen ] Canyou do it?
- No!
- I think I can can can
I think I can can if I wanna -
- I can can, think I can
Yes, I can, yes, I can -
- I know darn well I can
Yes, I can can -
Them words are too hard
to put there!
You know,
I'm ready to scrap this thing.
- [ Laughing, Chattering ]
- But, um-
But here is the thing.
Ifyou guys will learn the whole song-
everybody learn the whole song.
It's one ofthose things you've gotta
commit to. Learn the whole song.
I've learned it.
You can't scrap it. We're gonna
throwyou out ifyou scrap it.
- I'm ready to scrap it unless you learn it.
- N o. N o.
H ere's what- H ere's what-
The only way- Do you wanna do this song?
Of course! I t's a great song!
A lot of energy.
I don't know about that song.
I love that song. I love the feel of that song.
I love what it has to say.
But I just feel like- Wow.
It's a foot-stomping,
hand-clapping kind of thing.
The audience will love it.
We love it. I love doing it.
It's got a lot of life.
That's what we have- a lot of life.

- The world in which we live -
[ Stephen Narrating]
Steve Martin is an ex-Marine...
whose zest for life
is positively mind-blowing.
He drives a 1 30-mile-an-hour
Chrysler convertible...
works out three times a week...
and he 's got Mary Lou,
the girlfriend he calls his squeeze.
- -- [ Si ngi ng ]
- I'm having a hard time
remembering he 's nearly 80.
- T ry to fi nd peace wi thi n -
- Without steppin ' on one another -
- And do respect
the women ofthe world -
[ Stephen ] I've seen a little statuette
you've got downstairs which says...
- "You sexy beast"!
- [ Laughi ng ]
I got that-
I got that from Mary Lou...
so you'l I have to
ask her about that.
I thi nk she's been the recipient
of some of my physical activities.
[ Chuckles ]
So that's another cliché we could explode,
isn't it, about older- olderpeople?
Al I that bah, hum bug.

Does life in that department
stop at 70, or-
Hel I no!

[ Stephen Narrating ]
With each new rehearsal...
"I Feel Good"
is rapidly going backwards.
Dora still can 't get the timing...
while Stan keeps getting stuck
on the same two lines.
- And I ' I l hol d you i n my heart -
- I want- N othi ng can do-
You know- -
[ Bob ]
- My love can 't do you no harm -
- [ Grunts ]
- - My love can't do you no harm -
There's two I i nes,
and you just gotta get it.
You're holding the song
back right now.
Um-
- When I hold you in my -
You know what? Stan, take the mike
and just give it to us real big.
- [ Stephen ] Bob can be pretty tough onyou.
- Yeah, Bob can get tough.
Bob can get tough, and a lot of 'em
gets kinda upset when he holler at 'em.
And I looked at 'em, I says,
" He holler at you, holler back."
[ Chorus, Bob ]
- So good, so good-
- I got you -
Aaah!
- I feel nice -
- - Like I knew that I- -
- Like sugar and spice!
You know what? Forget it.
We'll just- I 'm giving up on this one.
All right, let's go to the next one-
"Nothing Compares 2 U."
A-Actually- Okay?
Uh-
[ Stephen ]
He's a tough guy, isn't he, Bob?
Oh, yeah.
He chews nails and spits rust.
[ Chattering ]
But I 'm tough too.
I can handle it.
We have five or six songs we're hoping to
try to present that are brand-new here...
and, um, I'll be surprised
if two or three make it, so-
But we're working really hard.
That's the important thing. And, uh- uh-
- So, where are we right now?
- We're in hell.
[ Stephen Narrating]
Later that evening...
it's something ofa relief
to escape the hothouse rehearsals...
when Fred and his wife Barbara
invite me over to their house.
[ Stephen ]
How long have you two been married for?
[ Both ]
Fi fty-four years!
You heard m e say the other day
that we stayed together for the kids-
she didn't want 'em, neither did I.
That wasn't true.
That's just his silly-
And we did things romantically.
We went dining and dancing
twice a week.
I went Tuesday, she went Thursday.
Wh- And then-
And then we had-
Our marriage was built
on faith and trust.
She had no faith in me
and I didn't trust her.
[ Stephen ]
That's a beautiful picture.
[ Fred]
Our first dance as Mr. and Mrs.
[ Stephen ]
Did he used to sing, Barbara?
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah?
- Was this a big thing for him to sing, or not?
- Y eah. He loved to si ng.
Where did he used to sing?
- I n the bathtub.
- I n the john. [ Laughi ng ]
[ Stephen Narrating ]
It's the Thursday before Easter...
and my last chance to catch up with the
chorus before they break for the holidays.
The first song on the agenda
is "Fix You. "
Nobody knows why, but Bob Salvini
didn 't make it to yes terday's rehearsal.
Today he 's back, but I'm s truck by how weak
he looks since I las t saw him five days ago.
I don't know whi ch i s worse to watch,
you getti ng down or Stan getti ng up.
That was a rough landi ng.

- When you try- best -
-- [ Slurring Words ]
- You get what you want
but not what you need -
-- [ Piano Continues ]
[ Bob ]
Try it from the beginning.
- T ry your best
but you don't succeed -
- - When you get - No.
- You gotta wait.
-- [ Piano: Melody]
- Tired, butyou can 't sleep -
- Stuck in reverse -
That's great! Do that agai n.
Stuck- That sounds great.
- Do that again?
- Yeah, I I i ke that.
- Stuck i n re- -
You surprised yourself.
- Stuck in reverse -
Canyou gojust a little bit-
- Stuck in rever-er-erse -
- I 'd I i ke to.
- Don't think so?
- Stuck i n rever- er- -
No.
Okay. That's all right.
- Stuck in reverse -
That's fine.
Bobby, it sounds great.
- Really?
- I t real ly sounds great.
You can't do anything
wrong here, Bob.
Al I ri ght.
[ Stephen Narrating ]
Only afterwards do we learn...
that Bob had been in hospitalyesterday,
suffering from ches t pains.
This afternoon his son
had begged him to s tay at home...
but Bob insisted on
coming to rehearsal.
- [ Stephen ] Bob, why didyou come today?
- Why am I here?
- Yes.
- I was afraid that if I m issed another one...
Bob would put
somebody else i n my spot.
[ Laughs ]
He's been known to do that before.
Basically, why did I come?
I came here because I love it.
You know, I've given him now
the blank CD...
and it may be that
he just does that at home.
We check 'em out one or two times.
I don't see the point
of making him come each time.
You know, whatever he gives us
on that song will be strong...
because it'll be coming
from, uh, somewhere.
We'll have to work
on certain points...
but, you know, this is the first I'm hearing
that he was in the hospital...
so that really...
makes me pause.
I-I don't want him doing things
that he's not capable of doing.
Areyou sure it's a wise idea
foryou to keep going?
Oh, yeah. Ab-Absolutely.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
I really love what I 'm doing.
And, uh-
[ Clears Throat ]
Okay, well, I wishyou
the very best ofhealth over Easter.
We'll seeyou guys in about
1 0 days ' time when we're back.
- Have a safe fl i ght.
- Yeah. Thanks very much. Have a safe everything.
- See you soon. Best ofluck now.
- Ri ght. Thank you.

Easter has been and gone...
and I'm back in Northampton
to catch the chorus in full swing...
as they gear up for the show
in less than three weeks.
The posters are being printed
and the show has got a name-
Al ive and Wel l
featuringJoe on sparkling form.
- And all the joy within you dies -
- Don't you want somebody to love -
Ahead lies a packed timetable
of extra rehearsals...
plus a very unusual gig in a local jail
at the end ofthe week.
- You'd better fi nd somebody to love --
But there 's been one
major change over Easter.
Two days after I left, Bob Salvini had
a cardiac arrest and was rushed to hospital...
where the last rites
were read to him.
Miraculously he pulled through...
but for a few hours it was touch and go
whether he would live or die.
Oh. I thought that was i t.
I real ly thought that was it.
So did my kids.
My younger daughter,
as soon as she got the phone call...
she woke up her baby,
threw him in the car and rushed over here.
We were all in the hallway thinking,
"This is it." You know?
Bob has had so many things...
where we think, "This is it"...
and he gets better.
I'm not sure if it's prayer, which-
I believe in prayer. Terribly believe in prayer.
Or if it's his strong will.
I think we're all set.
[ Stephen Narrating] Three days ago
Bob came out oflntensive Care.
This afternoon he's being moved from hospital
to a convalescent unit near his home.
Although he 's still very weak...
his doctors are amazed
by the speed ofhis recovery...
and his determination to make the show
in less than three weeks.
[ Doctor]
Said he wasn 't hungry and he wasn 't gonna.
I brought your watch. I thought that would
make you feel good ifyou had your watch on.
Get that for you.
- [ Stephen ] Hi, Bob!
- [ Whispers ] Hi, Steve.
Mary Ellen said
that he has 20 lives.
- Mmm.
- And, uh, he's used a bunch of'em up.
But he's, uh- Yeah, he's-
Yeah, he is amazing.
Are you going to make the show...
ifyou can make it, Bob?
Are you going to sing with the Young At Heart
chorus ifyou can do it?
That performance- Ifyou can do it.
I know you're gonna do it
ifyou can do it.
There's our poster that he looks at.
Makes him feel happy.
Yeah, I-I think- I think, um,
if he can do it, he will do it.
He's a trouper too. He wants to get back
and he may get back in time for the show.
- [ Stephen ] You think he might?
- He may.
Bob thinks he will-
Bob Cilman thinks he will.
So at the moment
you're doing his part, aren'tyou?
I 'm learning it
just in case he doesn't make it.
That's troupership,
whatever they call it.
How you feeling, Robert?
Good?
J ust give yourself a big hug.
When we say "three," just squeeze tightly.
- Ready?
- One, two, three.
[ Monitor: Sustained Tone ]
[ Woman ]
- Well, we -
[ Chorus ]
- Know where we're goin'-
[ Doctor]

- But we don 't know -

Wait a minute!

but we're making good time.

- [ Chorus ] - Way-ay-ay-ohh -

So, you know,
here's the report on Bob Salvi ni.
Some ofyou have been aski ng.
And that's that, um,
he has now been moved...
to, um, Sunbridge...
and he's getting rehab there.
And he should be done with that in
two weeks, and then on the Academy stage.
- [ Chuckling ] I don 't know
how it's gonna work, actually.
- [ Laughi ng, Murm uri ng ]
You know, Bob was i n bad shape.
- I don't know ifyou know.
- [ Woman ] Yeah, I know. I saw him-
- [ Man ] He had the last rites!
- He had the last rites.
I 'm curious- Have any ofyou
ever had the last rites said for you?
John, you had
the last rites said foryou?
They didn't know what was wrong
and they says, "We'll give you last rites."
- I said, "I don't care!"
- [ All Laughing ]
[ Woman ] They don't call 'em
the last rites tillyou're dead.
[ Bob ] You were dead. There was
no point in the last rites at that point.
Jean, didyou see that white light
that everybody talks about?
N o.
I refused to I ook.
[ All Laughing ]
- That's great! I don't wanna see the white I i ght!
- [ Bob ] That's a good one!
Who wants to see the light?
Right? [ Laughing ]
Who knows if it's ever gonna stop?
- I know we can make it -
- I know that we can -
- I know darn wel l
we can work it out -
- Oh, yes, we can, I know we can can
Yes, we can can -
- Why can't we ifwe wanna
Yes, we can can -
[ Stephen Narrating ]
The last time I heard it...
Bob was ready to throw out
"Yes, We Can Can. "
But the chorus spent the Easter break
getting their heads round all the "cans "...
and now it's back in with a chance.
- You missed a verse.
- You know what? I wanna end it there.
- I t's getti ng way too long.
- Okay.
Can't we just go there
and end it there?
[ Man ] With "Great gosh almighty,
yes, we can"and out?
No, I'd do it twice.
- Oh, yes, we can, I know we can can -
[ With Bob ]
- Yes, we can can -
- Why can't we if we wanna
Yes, we can can --
[ Stephen Narrating ]
It's 9: 00 on a Friday morning...
and the chorus are off
to the localjail...
to perform before
a bunch ofprisoners.
Over the years, they've
toured all over the world...
even sung to
the king and queen of Norway.
But this will be, in every sense,
their toughes t audience yet.
Before we join them on the bus...
Bob 's assis tant Diane tells me she wants
to say a word to the chorus first.
She asks us to wait outside.
- [ Woman ] Quiet!
- [ Man ] Listen up!
[ Di ane ]
I have some sad news.
Bob Salvi ni died last ni ght.
- [ Al I Groani ng ]
- [ Woman ] That's not true!
[ Chatteri ng, Murmuring ]
[ Diane ]
We got the call this morning.
[ Woman ]
Oh, my God.
It was quite sudden.
Yesterday afternoon,
he was practicing his song...
and he was looking forward
to seeing Bob Cilman today...
to practice it some more.
But... he gave out...
and we go on.
I know that this is
a difficult thing to hear...
as you're pulling
yourselves together...
to go and do a performance.
And my thoughts
are with you especially...
'cause I know
he was a big part for us-
- [ Man ] He certainly was.
- for all of us.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
We gotta press on...
in spite of it...
and, uh, keep him in our memory.
Yeah.
That's- That's-
That's the, uh, road we travel...
I'm afraid.
Good morning.
Good morning and welcome.
And, uh, a very, very warm and enthusiastic
welcome to the Young At Heart chorus-
[ Stephen Narrating]
Just one hourhas passed...
since the chorus learned
about Bob Salvini's death.
Now, before they've barely
had time to absorb the shock...
they have to face
an audience and perform.
Let's have a very warm, enthusiastic
welcome to the Young A t Heart.
[ Cheering, Whistling ]
Thank you very m uch.
Thanks for, uh...
Ietti ng us come and
do some songs for you.
U h, hope you enjoy them.

[ Stephen ]
How doyou go on in a situation like that?
Wel l, I -I guess
the other question is...
how do you not do it?
You know, how can you not...
out of respect for him,
respect for the situation-
I mean, people are
expecting you to perform.
And, you know...
I think you really have to go on.
We've had to do this a lot.
I mean, there have been many times...
when the chorus had to perform...
right after finding out
that somebody else had died.
And I think, uh-
I think it's really helpful...
to have everybody together
at that moment and to sing.
[ Bob ]
We got bad news today.
One ofour chorus members
died today.
His name was Bob Salvini. He was
a wonderful guy, and, uh, this is for him.

[ Cheeri ng, Whistl i ng ]
Yeah!
[ No Audi ble Dialogue ]
All right!
[ Voices Overlapping ]
I would like to say that...
this is the best performance
I ever seen in my life.
Fantastic. Fantastic.
Lot of spirit in these folks.
You're in my heart forever.
You're in my heart forever.
- Thankyou.
- Thankyou.
[ Stephen Narrating] In the days
that follow the concert at thejail...
the reality ofBob Salvini's death
sinks home to everyone in the chorus.
Above all, perhaps, to the man
most immediately affected by his loss.
- You get what you want
not what you need -
- When you feel so ti red
but you can't sleep -
I t was just a shock because
I knew he was ill, very ill...
but I didn't realize
it was that bad.
And I just-
My son came up that night
and he said...
"What's the matter, Dad?
You seem strange."
I guess I was just moved
by the fact that...
this man that I was going
to be doing a duet with...
um, passed away.
I always think that people who have
been with the chorus are with us.
You know, I think about the people
who aren't here anymore...
and I think that in some ways,
we always think about them.
But this is quite immediate, so-
- Lights will guide you home -
- And ignite your bones -
[ Stephen ]
Does it giveyou second thoughts...
about whetheryou want to go on
to this concert next week?
- Do you feel maybe you shouldn 't?
- Not a bit. No.
I ' m sti I l ready to go to the concert,
because that's-
When Bob fi rst asked me,
this is what it was to be.
And I 'm-I 'm pleased to do so.
- But doyou want to do it?
- Sure.
I n fact, I wanna
dedicate this song...
to Bob Salvini.
- Today is Lenny's...
- [ Lenny] No, no. Please.
86th birthday!
- [ Chattering ]
- -- [ Organ ]
- Happy birthday to you -
[ Stephen Narrating ]
With just 1 0 days to go before the show...
once again the chorus are together...
and this time
with something to celebrate.
- H appy bi rthday- -
Lenny told me he 's too old
to like birthdays anymore...
but I can 't help thinking
that right now...
he looks less like 86
and more like about 1 0.
- - T o you --
- - T o m e --
Thank you al l!
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
[ Bob ]
It doesn'tjust stop there.
- Happy bi rthday.
- [ Bob ] What's going on?
Lenny, you're being
attacked by women.
[Applause ]
[ Stephen ]
My exposure's al I wrong.
- [ Lenny ] I t's a I ittle dark i n here.
- I t's a I ittle dark i n here.
I'm gonna-
Just give me a second, yeah?
I 'l I give you
whatever you want, dear.
[ Lenny]
Wow. Thereyou go. What an offer!
Yes!
That's got Lenny excited.
[ Laughter]
- [ Chuckl i ng ]
- [ Stephen ] Happy birthday, Lenny.
Oh, you al ready said-
That's enough " Happy bi rthdays."
[ Eileen ]
We wanna keep saying it.
[ Stephen ] Yeah. So what's the problem
with birthdays then?
Nothi ng, except when
you reach this level of age...
you fi gure you don't need
to celebrate anymore.
[ Stephen Narrating ] The next morning
brings some worrying news.
After experiencing
breathing problems...
Joe went to see
his doctoryesterday.
He was told that
his white blood cell count...
had sunk to dangerously low levels...
making him extremely
vulnerable to infection.
Given his history of cancer...
he 's been brought to hospital
for an immediate blood transfusion.
So what happens i f there's some extra blood?
Where does that go?
- [ Laughi ng ]
- Does it come out here or what?
- No, no.
- I t doesn't?
You just call me.
I 'm right here.
[Joe ]
What doyou want me to callyou?
Any itching, chills, okay?
- Ifyou're not feeling good,
youjust let me know.
- Okay.
I'll be checkingyour blood pressure
in another 1 5 minutes.
[ Stephen ]
Are you, um-
A t the back ofyour mind,
are you worried about whether...
the cancer might be coming back?
N ot real ly.
I t doesn't bother me a bit.
I 've forgotten about it.
I 'm just happy...
to be up and around
and doing some singing.
That's- That's what my life is now.
You know, singing.
Helping my son and the family,
you know.
I don't think about it at all.
[ Scoffs ]
Don't bother me one bit.
The Lord knows how long
you're gonna be here, right?
You can push it
a little bit, but, uh...
your time is pretty well marked.
But I don't feel that it's here yet,
not for a long time.
I'm not worried about it at all.
Did I convince you?
- [ Stephen ] No.
- [ Chuckling ]
[ Stephen Narrating]
Over a period offouryears...
Joe went through
six bouts ofchemotherapy...
enough, according to his doctors,
to kill most people.
But in all that time,
he barely missed a single show.
You gonna keep on singing?
I thi nk that's the key.
Keep on si ngi ng,
goi ng to these countries.
And the people
appreciate you so m uch...
it kinda gives you
an uplift, you know.
Makes you feel great, you know.
I love it...
especially when you
go out on stage there.
They start clapping and everything else.
Oh, God.
That's really something.
[ Woman On P.A., Indistinct ]
Here we go.
- One more time, Ed.
I gotta get through a lot here.
- -- [ Pop ]
-- [ Vocalizing ]
[ Stephen Narrating]
DespiteJoe's absence, Bob presses on.
Ofall the songs, "Schizophrenia"seems
to have made the biggest leap forward...
almost unrecognizable from
what it was just six weeks ago.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah -
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah -
It is great! It's great.
It's our song, right?
It's the kind of song
we need to make us-
"pow," you know, with the audience.
That's us.
That's us, baby. That's us.
- [ Stamps Foot Down ]
- You got it.
- When I hold you in my arms -
[ Stephen Narrating ] But there's one song
which just never changes.
After more than 1 5 rehearsals...
Stan is still stuck
on the same two lines.
- - I won't do you-you no harm- -
- -- [ Stops ]
What, do you want me to
put more oom ph i nto it?
- Wel l, just- Yeah.
- Al I right.
Like you know it. Right now,
it looks like you're thinking about it.
- Okay. Okay.
- It's just two lines.
- Yeah.
- And the more energy
you put into it, the better.
- - I know I won't do you no harm -
- Right.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'm nervous about it.
- You're nervous? Why?
Huh? Well,just the, uh-
- just the impending performance.
- Oh.
But I'll get over that.
- Don't worry about that.
- No, I get it.
[ Phone Line Ringing ]
- [ Ringing Continues ]
- [Joe ] Hello?
[ Bob ]
Yeah, hi,Joe. How are ya?
- [Joe ] Bob, I just came back from the doctor's.
- Yeah.
H ow i s- H ow's your breathi ng?
- Not- Not that great.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's not very good.
- So what you need to do, J oe,
is stay home tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- And, uh-
- I was afraid to tell you that.
No, don't be afraid.
We just-
- I didn't thinkyou'd like it.
- No, no, I don't mind at all.
You do the best you can, you know?
The only thing we care about,Joe,
is you getting better.
- Yeah, well, me too.
- And that's all.
- I wanna be around for another 1 0 years anyway.
- I know. I know.
We got, uh-
We got-
We gotta cross the seas pretty soon,
so we need you healthy for that.
- Yeah.
- All right?
- I realize that.
- Yeah.
So do whatever you need to do
to take care ofyourself.
- I will.
- All right.
- Thankyou.
- Okay. We'll talk to you later.
- Adios, amigo.
- Adios to you too.
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.
[ Replaces Handset In Cradle ]
[ Stephen Narrating ] With everything
that's happened, Fred's wife Barbara...
is now becoming concerned
about Fred performing in the show.
But nothing will
s top Fred from going ahead...
despite the fact his doctor
gave him just two years to live...
after his last heart attack...
a deadline that ran out
four months ago.
You don't get out of this world al ive,
that's for dam n sure.
But this, it doesn't bother me.
I 've already written my eulogy
in poetry form.
"Ifyou're hearing this now,
you'll know that...
"I have gone to that
development office in the sky.
"But don't feel bad.
I've had a good life.
"I had a wonderful family
and a wonderful wife.
"And then, of course,
there have been all you folks.
"You've abided my kidding,
you've laughed at my jokes.
"You've heard them all,
even my little dog Rover.
You've heard them
all over and over."
That's already been written,
my eulogy...
at the end ofwhich,
by the way, my nephew-
We were always kidding him
about being out of the will.
At the end ofwhich I say,
"And if I go either to hell or heaven...
make sure Terry gets $1.87."
-- [ "Stayin'Alive"]
- Now you can tell by the way
I use my walk -
- I'm a woman's man
no time for talk -
- Music loud and women warm -
- I 've been kicked around
since I was born -
- But it's all right
It's okay -
- You can look the other way -
- We can try to understand -
- The New York Times ' effect on man -
- Whetheryou're a brother
or whetheryou're a mother -
- You're stayi ng al ive
stayi ng al ive -
- See the city breaki ng
and everybody shaki ng -
- We're stayi ng al ive
stayi ng alive -
- Life's going nowhere -
- Somebody help me -
- Somebody help me, yeah -
- Life's going nowhere -
- Somebody help me -
- Yeah -
- I 'm staying alive -
- I 'm staying alive --
[ Stephen Narrating ]
It's four days before the show...
and I'm joining Lenny for breakfast.
I'm keen to see how he's getting on
with "Life During Wartime "...
before the chorus 's
final rehearsal this afternoon.
But the latest news on
his singing partnerJoe isn 't good...
and it's now almost certain he won 't
be well enough to make the show.
I understand he, uh- he's back-
He's got pneumonia, and, uh...
that's something you don't, uh,
push off.
You know, that can be disastrous.
I'm hoping that he's got a strong enough
immune system to offset it.
[ Stephen ]
Joe is on the center ofthat poster, isn't he?
That's right. That's right.
We're gonna miss him.
Well, let's hope he's gonna be
well enough to actually be there.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Do you wanna put it up?
- H uh?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
There we go.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Stephen Narrating ] Fifteen minutes
after Lenny puts up the poster...
he receives a phone call
from Bob 's assistant Diane.
She tells him that
Joe died early this morning.
Last night, he checked himself
into hospital with breathing problems.
His worst fears had been realized.
The cancer had come back
and had entered his blood.
He diedjus t a week
after Bob Salvini.
- I t's been seven hours -
- And 1 5 days -
- - Si nce you took your love away -
- - Love away -
- I go out every night -
- And sleep all day -
- - Si nce you took your love away -
- - Love away -
- Since you've been gone -
- I can do whatever I want -
- I can see whomever I choose -
- I can eat my dinner -
- In a fancy restaurant -
- But nothing -
- I said nothing can
take away these blues -
- - 'Cause nothing compares -
- - Com pares -
- Nothing compares to you --
H e was just the most sweetest guy.
He never had a bad word
to say about anybody.
He made you happy.
There's gonna be a giant hole here.
I don't know-
There's nobody ever gonna fill that.
[ Stephen ]
How areyou guys bearing up?
N-Not well.
After the initial
shock and sadness...
we sort of got together
and decided...
that we would go on with the show.
But we've all said that about ourselves.
I've always said...
"If I collapse on the stage, just drag me off
and continue with the show...
because I'm only one person."
[ Stephen ]
Doyou think it's very difficult foryou...
to go on and do this concert?
No, it's not difficult for me, um...
because I knew hi m so wel l...
that he would want it to go on.
You know, he would definitely
want it to go on.
Absolutely positive.
And I would-
If anything happened to me...
I wouldn't want everybody to fall apart
and say, "Oh, we can't go on."
Um, I'd expect them to go on,
because I always tell people-
Foryears, I've told 'em- I said...
"When I pass on,
I shan't go out ofyour life.
"I shall be sitting up on a rainbow...
"looking down watching you.
"So keep doing what
we've always done together...
because I'll be there."
I n the first act
it'll be one, two and three...
although I kind ofwant
me and Johnny near each other.
- I think it kind ofworks
with a pair and a single one.
- Okay.
We lost a lot of light there.
Wanna sharpen it up, make it look-
No, it looks sharp.
[ Stephen Narrating]
At the end ofthe week in whichJoe died...
the day ofthe show has arrived.
A t 8: 00 tonight, the curtain goes up
at the Academy Theater.
-- [ H um m i ng ]
[ Man ]
That's good!
- [ Stephen ] What happens in the next hour?
- U h, I pace.
You know, I just-
I burn the rug here.
I just keep on goi ng
back and forth...
and thi nki ng about what it is that
we're going to be doing here tonight.
- I feel nice -
It's sold out. The person I was
supposed to go with couldn't make it.
My friends couldn't even get in.
Eight people, 1 0 people-
I'm by myself.
You might want to try the balcony.
- To a great show. ForJoe Benoit-
- Great show.
-Joe Benoit and-
- Right.
- And Bob.
- To Joe and Bob.
- And Bob. God bless them.
- Salud. Salud.
- Have fun.
- Good show, everybody.
Good show.
Come on.
Let's give 'em hell.
- [Audience Cheering ]
- Give 'em hell. Let's do it.
-- [ Pop ]
- Well, no one told me about her -
[ Chorus ]
- The way she lied -
- Well, no one told me about her -
- How many people cried -
- But it's too late
to sayyou're sorry-
- How would I know
Why should I care -
- Please don't bother
trying to find her -
- She's not there -
- Well, let me tell you about the way
she looked, the way she'd act -
- And the color ofherhair -
- Her voice was soft and cool -
- Her eyes were clear and bright -
- But she's not there -
-- [ Continues ]
- Thank you for coming.
It's the Young At Heart chorus!

On piano, Ed Wise.
On accordion, Chris Haynes.
On guitar, Freddie Johnson.
On drums, Billy Arnold.
On violin, Miriam Leader.
--[ Ends ]
[ Applause ]
We're working on a new show...
and we've got some new music
we're gonna try onyou, ifthat's okay.
So we are going to try
to do a song by Sonic Youth.
[ Stephen Narrating ]
Over the last six weeks...
Bob has driven the chorus in ever
weirder directions with "Schizophrenia. "
Not even they quite know
what they're doing with the song.
So what the audience will now
make of it is anybody's guess.
-- [ Rock ]
- I went away -
- T o see an ol d fri end of m i ne -
- H i s si ster came over -
- She was out of her m i nd -
- Her light eyes were dancing -
- She is i nsane -
- Her brother says she's just a bitch -
- With a golden chain -

- She keeps coming closer -
- Sayi ng, I can feel it i n my bones -

- I had a dream -
- - And it split the scene -
- [ Chorus ]- Split the scene -
- But I've got a hunch -
- - It's coming back to me -
- [ Chorus ]- It's coming back to me -

[Applause ]
[ Bob ] Steve Martin,
Elaine Fligman and Eileen Hall...
on "Schizophrenia. "
[ Woman ] That was great, Louise.
You rocked my world.
[ Bob ]
Good job, guys. Real ly good job.
H ad fun i n that fi rst act.
Once we get out there,
we give it al I we can. [ Laughi ng ]
[ Stephen Narrating ]
"Schizophrenia" was a triumph...
but the second act is yet to come...
and Bob is now
a complete bundle ofnerves.
He 's still got
three songs to get through-
"Yes We Can Can "
with its 7 1 "cans "...
"I Feel Good, " and "Fix You"...
which began as a duet
and is now a solo.
[ Man ] You were saying to me that
this was your last performance.
- What do you mean by that?
- Wel l, i nstead of a swan song,
it's my U gly Duckl i ng song.
I 'd left the chorus
because I can't get around...
and it's very difficult
to sing all the time with this thing.
So this is probably,
you know-
I won't sing with them
unless it's a special occasion.
Maybe a 25th anniversary,
I'll come back and do a number.
Those are the only times
I come back.
- When I hold you in my arms -
- I know I can't do no wrong -
[ Stephen Narrating]
With five minutes left before the second half...
I catch Stan and Dora
outside the theater...
cramming in some badly needed revision
on "I Feel Good"...
a song they've never actually managed
to get through from start to finish...
in the entire seven weeks
they've been learning it.
- - I feel good -
- -- [ Vocal izi ng ]
[ Stephen ] So, are you gonna
make any mistakes tonight?
- H uh?
- I ' m not planni ng on it.
- We ai n't gonna make no m istakes.
- I 'm not planning on it.
Ifwe make mistakes,
we just have to keep going through it.
- That's right.
- We cannot stop.
- Yes. I n the-
- Ifwe make a mistake, we keep going.
- Definitely in the, uh- in the showbiz tradition.
- Right.
- Ifwe make a mistake, we do not stop.
- You just don't stop at all.
We just move- move on.
J ust put your word in there
and keep going.
- That's all we have to do.
- We are not supposed to make no mistakes.
- And we'll capture that audience.
- Yes, we will.
- We'll get 'em. We'll take 'em down.
- We'll get 'em.
- Don't worry about that.
- We'll fix 'em. We'll fix 'em.

Many ofyou probably know that
two of our members passed away this week.
The first was Bob Salvini.
Bob was this wonderful singer-
Italian singer.
He came to us si ngi ng
I tal ian love songs...
and, uh, light opera...
and we made him sing rock and roll.
J oe Benoit was part
of our current group...
and he was really one of
the centers of our current group.
Joe was just a beautiful guy.
He was one ofthe sweetest, most wonderful
people you'd ever wanna meet.
And his loss has left
a huge hole for us...
and we wanna pay
tri bute to both of them.
One of the great performers
of all time with Young At Heart...
is here with us today
to sing a song.
Please welcome Fred Knittle.
