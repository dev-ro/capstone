Another day in paradise.
Omigod, I found him.
There he is.
This guy's been doing this
every day since lockdown began.
He's coming.
Ha! Here he is.
Majestic.
See, this is what happens
when they put us on house arrest
for a crime we didn't commit.
People start going apeshit.
Exhibit A right here.
Where's your mask?!
And where is your mask?
Hi, I'm Annie Hardy
and you're watching Band Car,
the internet's number 1
live improvised music show
broadcast...
...from a moving vehicle.
Here's how it works.
You write in one word
in uppercase letters.
I'm making a beat
I'm gonna improvise a song
and work in your word
and before too long...
...we will have made
a collaboration.
I don't know, why not?
Something tells me
you're not up to much.
Yes, lockdown, getting it on.
Having to fuck your own Dad.
Come on, that's rough.
But we do what we must.
If you can't be free you must...
...commit the sin of incest.
It's not the worst
but it's not the best.
I don't really know -
do what you want.
I don't judge, I'm objective
as motherfuckin' fuck.
Yeah, nice bike...
...man.
"Ring, ring," I'm
calling 'em up.
"What you up to today,
you dumb fuck?
"Staying inside,
hashtag stayin' safe?
"Man, you can suck my queef."
Is it safe to be so lonely?
Everybody's trying
to kill they-selves.
This place is like
a living hell.
For something
with a 99.6 recovery rate.
Raae--
Meh.
I gotta get outta here.
Oh, shit on my face.
Gosh, darn it!
Fuck, fucking, fuck-ass.
I'mma kill someone. Damn it.
Gotta bring this.
This one?
I see you.
I told her that I was leaving
two nights ago
and she proceeded to
immediately urinate on my pants.
I wasn't wearing them.
They were on the ground.
It's OK, Goostein.
I'm feral too, I understand.
It is one of the hardest things
for me to do...
...to leave this little cat.
Otherwise who cares?
This place is a shithole.
Angels, if I'm
forgetting something,
tell me now or forever
hold your peace, please.
Mm.
And we're off...
...to see the world.
Welcome to the ghost town.
I never seen LAX
like this before.
Gate 135 boarding,
ghosts only to the ghost plane.
This shit is nuts.
Check out "future me" over here.
Don't sound so good either.
I got this hat clip thing
at Duty Free.
"And they all wondered
why she got...
"...brain cancer."
- Hello.
- Hello, how are you?
I'm good.
58K, straight
over there, on the right.
Thank you!
And we're off.

Here we are rolling up

This is it.
Hopefully, nothing's
changed too much.
"All lives won't

Brother.
Yes!
I knew Stretch would not let
me down by changing ever.
Fucking British keys, man.
Pretty gay.
And I mean that
in the 1990s way.
I'm gonna drop trou here.
Stretch has
a photograph to commemorate
the first time he got crabs.
Oh, what's going on in there?
I recognise that nose
and all that cum swilling
out of his mouth anywhere.
There's good old Stretch
back in the day...
...my nice, sweet little friend.
Yeah, there is
someone behind me.
It's your dad who just pulled
his micro penis out of my ass.
It's Stretch.
I'm gonna do what I used to do.
We used to do this
to each other on tour.
It's called the
Silverlake Handshake.
It's pretty cool.
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Hey, hey! Fuck!
- Gemma, it's OK, it's OK.
- Shit on my dick!
We're here on my first morning
at Stretch's house.
Let's see what have
they to eat for me.
Smells
like health food!
What in the mother-F are these?
You know, Stretch used to
love a nice cheeseburger.
I don't know...
...what went wrong, huh.
Hello!
Good morning.
Morning.
Would you like a coffee?
I would love one,
thank you.
Just...
...rub it together.
Got it.
One of my viewers
says that you're hot.
Oh!
Thanks.
This other guy says that he
wants you to take your tits out
and he's pretty
adamant about it.
How do you respond to this
display of toxic masculinity?
Sorry, do you wanna--
I just wanna keep social
distancing, thanks.

That is me from back

- Remember this?
- 2010.
Tell me.
I want to hear stories.
He was crazed back then.
We call him Stretch.
And I think he's always thought
that it's just because he's
really tall.
That is exactly why it is.
- But that's not why.
What?
You know, nightly after shows,
he would find a groupie
from the crowd, select her,
cast his wizardry spell on her
and bring her backstage
where he would take
two fingers and stretch
her butthole apart...
- Oh!
- That is not true.
...and insert a backstage
fruit or vegetable.
That is not true.
Yes, it is so.
- No, no, it's not.
That's-- I'm called
"Stretch" because I'm tall.
Could I have some sugar?
I'm called "Stretch"
because I'm tall.
To me,
it sounds like you're ashamed
and I think that's a bad, bad
thing to hold in your body.
Let's get rid of it!
Let's do
a shame-expelling exercise.
- I'm not ashamed.
What we gotta do here
is stamp our right feet...
- ...and make a sound!
 - Yeah, come on, Amar.
- Come on, babe.
- You guys do it.
Come on, Stretch!
You got Stretch in the car with
my main girl Annie Haaarr....
D...icks is all I wanna... it.
"Eat" I meant to say.
Looking round for a butt buffet.
I love food.
I love eating food.
Whether it's hot or it's cold,
I'm in the mood.
Gonna get some right
up in his boot,
right in the undercarriage,
you know that looks cute.
I got stuff in my ass,
that's true it's not grass -
it's fruit.
I got a butt buffet.
He's got a butt buffet,
like, every day.
He's got two apples
and a motherfucking grape.
Can I get maybe one orange?
All I wanna know...
...what rhymes with orange?
Every single day
I got a butt buffet...
...in my ass.
- He's got a butt buffet.
Order number 2,
veggie all-day breakfast.
- Number 2, yeah.
- Number two!
That's me.
Stretch, completely
winning at life.

but Stretch is a survivor. ♪
♪ Got him a job as a

♪ Suck your dick for a fiver. ♪
He'll do it for free.
That's pro bono.
- Shut up.
I brought you a gift, Stretch,
from my homeland.
It's an orgonite Pyramid.
It's got crystals inside of it.
It'll help you so that
your erectile dysfunction
won't flare up so much.
Thank you, essential worker.
Lord bless the man's food.
- No, don't touch the food.
- Step back.
He said I
was gonna be fine.
They furloughed me for
a month so, you know,
we were just chill.
And then they just kept
stringing us along
and they weren't really telling
anybody what was going on.
I don't know, I thought--
Track 'n Trace.
What's Track 'n Trace?
You've gotta
sign in with an app.
They make you sign in?
This is insane!
Can you just, um...if you could
just put on the mask, please--
Oh, I'm wearing a mask.
It's a new fibre technology
where you can't actually see it.
It's good.
- OK, yeah.
But trust that I'm wearing one.
Yeah, no, I do need you
to put on a mask though.
Come again. I can't
understand you, the muffled
sound of your mask.
I'm saying if...
I'm saying if you're in here...
- Oh, hypocrite!
- ...you need to put a mask on.
Mask on cos
this is my job.
I cannot put the mask on because
it's my job to tell the truth
that this is a scam.
- Can you turn that
phone off, please.
Do you know anyone
who's died of Covic?
- Answer me and I'll leave!
- Get her out of the shop.
- I'm so sorry.
- Just get her out of here.
You guys need
to fucking wake the fuck up.
- Don't touch anything!
- Put your mask on.
His nose is out, so
how's that work?
I told you to get out the shop,
so get out the fucking shop!
- Get out! Get out!
- Annie.
- Get out the fucking--
- Annie, just stop.
It's fucking hectic.
Get the fuck out the shop!
- Sorry, mate. Annie, please!
- Seriously! Get her out.
Listen, Annie--
- Fuck you!
Get this fucking crazy bitch
out of my shop.
I'm sorry.
- Annie, just fuck off.
- I'm so sorry, mate.
- In both cultures.
Annie, go on, behave.
Don't do that.
America, England,
America, England.
- Sorry, mate. Annie!
- Rounding them up for the camps.
Annie, just wait in
the fucking car.
Fuckin' idiot.
Stretch, come on.
That guy was a fuckin' asshole.
Stretch...
Maybe your feminazi girlfriend
will be happy to see me.
Not coming in
this fucking house!
You'll risk our fucking safety!
Get her the fuck out
of this house, Amar!
They're
deciding my fate in there.
Well, will I be executed
for owning a red hat?
Or will I be allowed to live?
Find out on the
stunning conclusion
of "This is Fucking Bullshit".
Thank you very much.
I'm outta here.
See you fucking libtards later.
Yo!
MAGA, Stretch,
you fucking libtard bitch.
Big-ass nose and
the legs of a chick.
In, my friend, you
are not, it in...
...to tonight -
do the bitch right -
plus you won't forgive me
for stealing the car, aite.
May have made a mistake,
but probably not.
My biggest mistake was
thinking that you didn't suck.
No one understands
me, no one could.
I got the brain of a genius,
you got the brain of wood.
You can't

Hello!
Annie, where the fuck are you?
Bring my car back right now,

Bitch I don't have your car.
I don't know what you're
talking about.
Bring my car back right now
or I am gonna call--
I am gonna take
all of your things
and I'm gonna empty it out
in the street.
Don't smoke in my fucking car!
We're gonna call
the police on you!
I'll throw all your
shit out on the street if you
don't come back.
Biatch!
Oh, Stretch, buddy, looks like
someone wants you to deliver
them some food.
Well, I'm hungry too.
Should we take it or what?
You think?
"Accept" and then
it's confirmed.
Don't worry, man. I would
never put your job in peril.
This looks to be it.
The Beano Cafe.
There better be-no problems
with my order today.
You know, sometimes I think
you're the only ones who
understand me.
Then I realise you guys don't
quite understand me either.
But most of you guys...
...are at least nice to me.
I don't need nobody else.
My Band Car-holics tonight
are the only ones
who matter in this world.
Alright.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello!
I'm picking up an order.
Oh, there's
no-fucking-body here, man.
What shall I do?
Those look a little past due.
What'd you said?
"Check the cash register."
I'm not a thief.
British food is horrible.
Eughhh.
Stop it, nobody's behind me.
They should be though,
know what I'm saying?
What is this here?
Looks like I found the location
of where Stretch's girlfriend's
been keeping his nuts
and all her previous boyfriends'
as well.
Dare me? Send me 20 bucks
to my cash app, Venmo or PayPal
and I will eat a Covic egg.
Got that pay notificache.
I'll put this Covic
egg in my face.
Oh, it's not good.
Hello? Excuse me.
Hey, sorry, we're closed.
- Oh, um... 
- Excuse me.
- You can't be back there!
- Oh, no, no, no.
Sorry, you need to leave.
- Delivery!
- You need to--
- I'm not a normal person.
- Oh, shit, sorry.
That's my fault.
I should have cancelled it.
- Yeah, probably.
- I'm sorry.
Wait, you're not gonna give
me some food?
We've had a really busy
night. I'll sort out a refund.
Not very socially
distance safe, just sayin', you know.
Apologies.
Whatever.
At least I got a snack.
Hey!
Have you got a car?
If you're trying to steal
one of my kidneys,
I wouldn't bother,
because those things
don't barely work.
Listen, I just need you to take
my friend somewhere nearby,
the usual guy let us down.
It won't take long.
People do
that, let you down.
Listen, it needs to stay
between us, OK?
I'll pay you extra
but don't mention...
not a word to
anybody, OK, promise?
I promise, yeah...
- She's sleeping. I'll just wake her up.
- ...totally.
Angela, Angela,

Angela, come on, lovely.
That's it, good girl.
Come on. Let's get up.
Are you OK?
That's it, good girl.
OK. You're OK.
OK, Angela, this lady's gonna
just take you to some
friends, OK?
- Nope!
- Please, wait, wait!
I'm just desperate.
Wait a minute, please.
No, lady.
Look, please, look, I really
need you to do this for me.
What is this,
some human-trafficking shit?
- She's not safe here, please--
- No shit!
- Half an hour at most.
- Somethin's up here.
- Please!
- No.
Look, wait, stop, look...
You know, a lot of people
don't know this about me
but I'm actually a
really good person.
Lean against the car
for a second. I just gotta
get my key out here.
Alright!
Welcome to the Band Car,
Angela - it's your first ride.
Put her little feeters in there.
Oh, great! Good girl.
It's OK, we're safe.
Oh, no, no, no, Angela.
You gotta stay inside for me.
OK, Angela, don't worry.
Just sit back.
And there we go.
Let me get a pen,

Oh, fuck!
Stretch!
Start the car.
No!
Eat shit!
Omigod, gross!
Give me the camera.
Film me with this stupid bitch.

- No! What are you, white?
Come on, this is the best
episode of Band Car ever!
Don't hit me!
Hi, I'm Annie Hardy.
We're live on Band Car
with this psychopath bitch
who just tried to kill us.
Ma'am, can you tell us why
you've tried to murder us today?
Alright!
Watch it, bitch.
Annie, this is fucked up.
Do you like that shit?
Please don't
make me do that again.
You seem to be hurt.
Tell me where the pain is.
Fuck you.
Where did he touch you?
Show me on the doll.
Fuck!
Well, that's what you get
for getting too clos--
- Whoa!
- I'll fucking kill you.
- Fuck off her. Get off!
- I'll kill you.
Relax!
What the fuck
do you want?
Angela!
She's 16.
- Please...
- What are you talking about?
She's my daughter.
Please give her back.
I'm not a math whiz,
but this seems
highly improbable, ma'am.
- She's fucking old.
- No. No, she's 16. Please...
Ma'am, you must be rocking some
sort of Benjamin Button vagina.
- Can we have a look?
- Shut up.
Back pocket.
You keep your vagina
in your back pocket?
You told him to do it.
Don't #metoo him later.
Let me see
this sundried tomato snatch.
What?
What the fuck are you doing?
Fuck, Annie!
It's fucking real.
- What you talking about?
It's really Angela! Look, look.
It's the Ariana Grande tattoo,
I've seen it...
Why are you talking
about Ariana Grande?
...at the diner. She's got
the same Ariana Grande tattoo.
Angela!
- Angela!
- Oh, fuck!
- Leave her, we've gotta go!
- Come with us.
We gotta get outta here.
Oh, fuck. Fuck this bitch.
- You're not gonna help her?
Stay away from her.
- Angela!
- Don't go near her!
- I've got you, baby.
- Fuck!
Get in the car.
Go, Annie!
What the fuck!
That bitch's head!
Annie!
Annie! Wait!
Annie! Annie, wait.
Fuck!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Annie!
Oh, fuck me.
Hello?
Sorry, your
call could not be connected.
Please try again later.
Annie!
Annie! Oh, fuck.
Annie!
Annie, wake up.
Annie! Annie!
Annie!
Annie.
What's happening?
- No, no! What the fuck!
- It's alright, it's me.
- Annie...
- Fuck you.
Annie, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
It's not fucking funny,
you narc.
Fuck! Annie, come on.
Annie.
Annie!
Annie.
"I'm sorry."
I'm sorry
you're such a libtard idiot...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
...and your fucking girlfriend's
such a stupid bitch.
Stop it.
- Give me that phone.
Give me the phone!
Annie!
Annie!
Follow my voice.
- Stretch!
- Annie!
Come on, come with me.
Annie!
Breathe!
It's gonna be fine.
You just need to breathe.
Annie... you're
Annie fucking Hardy, right?
What are you always telling me?
You've got bigger balls
than me, right?
I know!
- How big are my balls?
- Your balls are small.
My balls are fucking tiny, OK?
Come on! I was
the one who got hit by a car.
It's not a competition.
Let's get out of here.
OK, you're kinda being
a bit of a pussy right now.
Come on, follow me.
It's this way.
Fuck me!
Retard.
- Stretch!
- Annie!
- Stretch!
- Help me, Annie!
