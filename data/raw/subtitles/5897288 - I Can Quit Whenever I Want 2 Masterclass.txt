Still it's not bad.
It's not at all bad.
Of course it's difficult,
we're doing oxidization-reduction.
But I've got an amazing bunch
of North Africans,
they're Arabs,
they've got numbers in their blood.
Pietro, in six months
you'll be getting out, on probation.
- Who told you that?
- Vittorio.
What does Vittorio know ?
He's a canon lawyer!
This is criminal law,
it's totally different.
No, because the money you earn here,
we need it. For the boy as well.
Love, don't worry, because
every problem has a solution !
Sure, I've got this sword of Damocles
of good conduct, that's a problem.
Can't you come up with something ?
I arranged a fight with the Albanians
in the canteen.
A little stabbing,
I might get another year
That's something...
...isn't it?
It was a joke...
Did you read the papers
you have to sign ?
Wait, remind me again what kind
of papers we're talking about,
cos I've got so much correspondence
and in prison it's all on paper
Pietro, stop it! The papers
for sole custody of the boy.
Ah' yes' yes' Yes! the Papers Yes
yes! Ye5--.no.,, V
what must've happened is with the
transfer from one prison to another,
they kind of got lost...
It's a classic when you move house !
Pietro, this is important,
don't do your usual.
I understand, Giulia,
but why do we have to rush things?
After all you've done
you say not to rush things?
How's Fabio ?
What's Fabio got to do with it?
No, because I stumbled upon
a not-very-recent news magazine,
and apparently the Turkish-Syrian
border is a powder keg,
so I thought for sure Fabio will be
saving innocent lives there...
where he's fucking needed !
Pietro, please, don't be childish.
Anyway, he's in Rome.
Help me understand something...
he's the only Doctor Without Borders
who never goes beyond
the Rome ring road...
Millions of children to be saved,
and he wants to save mine!
Who looks just fine to me anyway !
They called him home for an honorary
degree in international mediation.
- And you'll go with him...
- Yes !
It's an important ceremony,
and everyone will be there...
from the rector to the deans...
And he didn't want to go alone.
Sure. So you sacrificed yourself.
Pietro, sign the papers.
Yes, I understand,
the papers, the papers...
Saverio, how long is this visit that
should have finished 30 minutes ago?
Listen...look...
I'm afraid I have a whole series
of things to do, and so I have to...
- The papers !
- The papers, sure.
But we'll talk next week, Giulia.
I've been giving you the signal for
the last half hour! Pay attention !
I'm sorry, I didn't see.
You didn't see!
We rehearsed 50 times.
When I do this with my hair,
you interrupt the visit.
- What does it take?
- I was distracted !
You're a public servant
who has social functions to fulfill.
There's a prisoner in trouble,
you can't get distracted !
You owe me a favor ! I'm telling you.
Piano, pianissimo
Senza parlar !
Shit, if the warden hears you,
he'll take the part from you.
It is not easy, you know.
Why the fuck are you looking for me?
Hello, Claudio,
I'm very happy to see you as well.
I realize we have our differences...
- What the fuck do you want?
- Have you disinfected that thing ?
All we need is for the tetanus
to come back. OK, all right.
Listen, I have to ask you
something very important...
EIGHTEEN MONTHS EARLIER
Love, love...love. You're really
Russian, you're Russian !
What...no, no, no, no!
No, no, I won't accept it,
do not involve...
do not involve...
do not involve my colleagues !
You don't know them !
Aprovdanie for this.
I'm asking for aprovdanie.
I'm asking for aprovdanie!
I'm a jerk and aprovdanie!
But as regards the moral and academic
caliber of my colleagues, I can't...
Fuck!
Officer, what about this report?
Have a seat, my colleague is coming.
I've been waiting for two hours !
- Please, move away !
- All right...
Well done, eh, good.
Good evening, Detective.
- When did he get here?
- Two hours ago.
He was doing 200 in a rental coupe.
And he had these with him.
He's one of them.
He also had a nightstick, a gas gun,
and thousands of euros.
- A phone ?
- Pardon ?
- Did he have a phone?
- Yes, sure.
- Who's got him ?
- Galatro.
What a pain !
Couldn't you question him ?
I know, but the chief insisted.
OK. Check the last number he called.
- Yes.
- OK.
Look, the drugs you had with you,
we know them well.
Are you part
of the researchers' gang, Albe?
What's up ?
You thought we didn't know anything?
You thought nobody would notice,
that you could do as you please?
You wanna talk about smart drugs?
Coletti, who reports to the Ministry
about new substances?
We do, Chief.
Then, you're in the right place,
Albe !
Yes, but I don't know anything.
All I know is
that you can't do this !
You can't hold me, I...
I have a right to a lawyer, right?
OK, OK.
For now you've won.
I don't know where you got
this molecule, but you did.
But it's only a matter of time
before it becomes illegal.
Who are the others, Albé?
Chief, can I have a word ?
Hi, Coletti.
- He's one of them, right?
- One of who?
A ramshackle gang
of ex-university researchers.
They synthesized the best legal
substance of recent years,
they do everything themselves,
from production to sales,
and they merge perfectly, I don't
know how, in criminal circles...
I don't know
if they're that ramshackle.
You think Notorious BIG back there
is someone who merges anywhere?
Because he doesn't seem to me...
He's like this now, but so what?
It's the first time we've caught one.
Caught is a big word.
The traffic cops busted him
just because he wrecked his car.
Then I did bad cop for a while,
I can hold him for a few hours for
DUI, but then we'll send him home.
Send him home?
We're not sending anybody home.
- He'd half a kilo of pills.
- Half a kilo of legal pills.
We can't arrest him!
Chief, we're the police,
that's what we do, we arrest people.
What do you mean,
we can't arrest him ?
Paola, I understand that dealing
with smart drugs isn't the tops,
and I understand that
all this attention on new drugs
is a career opportunity for you,
but it's hard enough combating
illegal things,
never mind legal ones...
but now we have the molecule,
we report it,
and the researchers' gang ends here.
Hello, Alberto, are you hungry ?
I know you like Chinese,
but not what exactly...
I hope this will do.
Eat, Albé.
Alberto, I am Detective Paola Coletti
of the Drugs Squad.
Ideal with smart drugs,
and I want to get you all
out of the mess you've caused.
But in order to do that
I need to talk to your boss.
I gotta get out of here.
You shouldn't even be here,
you're a university professor
Can you tell that gentleman
the coat he's wearing is mine?
I tried to speak to him,
but he's not inclined to dialog.
Alberto, I need to talk to your boss.
- I don't have a boss.
- I have to speak with Pietro.
The last call you made.
You're the only gang in the world
using registered phones.
And we know everything, we know
who you are, we know what you do,
we know
you stepped on Murena's toes...
They're dangerous people, believe me.
Tell Pietro and tell him that with us
there's always a way out.
You need to explain why we're holding
someone with no criminal record.
Call me when Pietro Zinni gets here,
we're this close, Daniele.
- Why will Zinni come?
- Trust me, he will, just watch !
No, hang on...
Paola...!
So, Zinni,
you're giving yourself up?
No...
I'm negotiating.
I assume all the responsibility
for what we did,
but you have to leave the others
alone.
And why would I do that?
Because I'll give you Murena.
You only need to put a roadblock at
the ring road exit at the Casilino.
And in the trunk you'll find stuff to
get him sentenced to ten years-plus.
What's this ?
The solution to the problem
of smart drugs.
Smart drugs exist in a legal vacuum,
right ?
So officially we can't do anything.
But if we had a squad
that acted beyond the law
and dealt with it for us?
A squad ?
Pietro Zinni and his gang.
You mean it?
- They go where the law can't.
- They're four losers.
They had three months of glory
and then messed up.
The commissioner wants smart drugs?
I need you to stay with me.
You're young and full of enthusiasm,
but we did all this in the '70s!
Look at this, look, look.
Alberto Petrelli, whom we arrested
and released a few months ago.
Maybe the best computational chemist
in Italy,
accused of driving while intoxicated
and pimping.
In reality, he's the creator
of the yellow tablet.
Completely dependent on hard drugs,
he's currently in rehab.
But, Father,
I don't know what else to tell you !
If we continue to cut the clay
with dissolved pirociastite,
all we get is this poor
conglomeration of ignibrite. It's...
Alberto, the result isn't important,
what's important
is the rehabilitation.
What's rehab got to do with it?
If the molecular structure's wrong,
of course we'll always fail !
I'm sorry, but I'm not signing
this Our Lady of the Rosary.
The superficiality of the Church...
Mama Argeﬂ and Gorge Siwom,
interpretative semiotics
and Latin epigraphy.
They're the armed wing of the gang,
accused of attempted murder
and assault,
pending trial
they're working in a downtown hotel.
[SPEAKING INDIAN]
The hotel's great, a lovely big room
The only problem's the staff.
I've got two assholes in front of me
now, two total dickheads.
They're ridiculous. I'd take a photo
of them but it would seem rude.
Excuse me! How dare you ?
Forget it.
He says he's from Delhi, but from
his accent he's clearly uncouth !
So I had the trial,
the lawyer, and the expenses.
The judge says, either you find
a job or you're back inside.
Which is why I really need thisjob !
Andrea De Santis, anthropologist,
an expert in the conceptual mimesis,
he was responsible
for the invisibility of the gang.
Armed robbery,
currently working in a junkyard.
- Well ?
- You did dialectology with Ricci ?
Yes...yes.
You can hear it from
how you pronounce the alveolars.
In fact, we did a monograph
with the professor
Remember last Wednesday's one ?
He was Ricci school as well !
- That was the gutturals.
- The gutturals...
I'll tell you honestly...
you didn't do too bad !
The problem is that our corporate
policy is not to employ graduates.
Your burden, you should've thought
about it before, Mallio !
Actually, my name is Edoardo.
Stop humiliating yourself, now, stop.
Thank you, thank you. My respects.
Arturo Frantini,
classical archeology,
embezzlement of state property
and kidnapping,
the only one who returned
to his former life.
What did I tell you, sir?
It's fucking nothing ! An amphora.
It's anything but an amphora.
This is one of the biggest finds
of late classical Rome.
I have to finish the subway
this year
I understand that, and
I have emphasized my civic spirit,
but you understand, sir, here you
absolutely have to stop the work.
Ah ! Sir!
Sir! Don't leave me here again !
I told you last month
that the rats climbed the rope.
Sir, I will not yield to blackmail !
Bartolomeo Bonelli,
dynamic macroeconomics,
took care of the financial affairs
of the gang.
Close to the Sinti mafia, the
prosecutor will ask for extortion.
Bartolomeo, come and clean the camel.
This is impossible!
Again ?
This camel shits 60 times a day!
Something's not right, it eats
five kilos of grass, I feed him myself.
It shits ten, where does it get
the extra five kilos ?
It's an algebraic paradox.
- It's normal.
- You don't understand anything !
Do you have a teaching program
on linear algebra?
I don't think so. So, please, don't
talk about these things, thank you.
And then, what the hell,
I don't understand...
why do I always have to deal with
this camel ? I wanted to sell it!
The camel's not for sale.
Ah no say words in here house...
And how do you plan to convince
these gentlemen ?
Through their leader, the
neurobiologist, he has most to lose.
Pietro Zinni,
membership of an armed gang
and criminal conspiracy,
the prosecution asks for 12 years.
I call Mr. Danilo Autero,
eyewitness and victim
as well as civil party in this trial.
If the prosecutor
would like to proceed...
So, Mr. Autero, beyond the statements
already given to my colleagues,
as well as the CCTV images,
can you tell us from memory, what
happened on the evening of May ??
Yes, well, it was about 19:56/57
when they come into the pharmacy,
wearing balaclavas, first Professor
Bonelli, then Professor De Santis,
and then Professors Argeri
and Sironi.
They produced Napoleonic rifles
with bayonets from a ski bag,
and then Professor Zinni came in,
but he had a gun.
Lucky for us you erased his memory...
He doesn't remember shit.
He's bullshitting randomly.
While Professor De Santis told me
not to press an imaginary button,
which he thought was connected to a
silent American-style alarm system...
Oh, no, oh, no...please, please.
Behave!
Do you remember the shooting ?
From here on, total black-out.
Yes, absolutely.
I recognized Professor Zinni,
because a few months earlierl sat
an exam with him at the university,
and so Professor Argeri
decides to shoot me.
I hear the professors argue fiercely,
while Professor De Santis pushed
to give me the coup de grace.
From here on, total black-out...
After a short time
I hear the voice of Professor Zinni
really distinctly,
who claims to be able to sedate me
to the point of erasing
my short-term memory.
I can understand
that the situation...
What the fuck do I know ?The bastard
must have real tolerance !
If I'd been there I'd have told you
that memory wiping
is a para-alchemical process !
Alberto, don't break my balls !
Pietro, we're in deep shit,
aren't we ?
Your Honor,
I wouldn't go any further.
These memories are very painful
for the witness.
Thank God you negotiated with
the police and didn't risk anything.
Thank God you negotiated with
the police and didn't risk anything.
Yes, but I repeat, how could I know
that the pharmacist had the most
extraordinary tolerance to Vicodin ?
Anyway it's only the first hearing,
I'm very confident about the next.
Pietro, we're talking
ten years in prison.
This whole thing
is becoming more and more absurd.
- I don't know if I can do this.
- What's absurd, Giulia?
I made a legal drug, I did so
at a time of economic downturn,
and I did it for you, for us,
for that fucking dishwasher,
and above all I did for the boy.
What the fuck ?I wasn't even
pregnant when you started !
What ? If you appeal
to the lunar calendar then it all...
Maybe you don't understand,
but you risk not seeing your son
until he finishes school.
If he does,
because the children of prisoners...
What...? What about them ?
What have the children of prisoners
got to do with me, sorry ?
I risk raising him on my own.
I earn 700 euros a month
at the center, what am I gonna do?
Maybe I should ask for sole custody
of the child.
No, sorry...what?
This kid isn't even born and you
already want to take him from me?
I understand the moment,
and I respect that as well,
but give me some time,
I'll figure something out.
That's what worries me !
The last time, I got kidnapped.
In fact, see ?
The worst is over, Giulia.
What else can happen?
Hey, Metro.
Er, apart from the surrealism
of the situation,
I should tell you
that this is Mohamed's bed,
and he's very jealous of his things,
very irascible, but, above all,
prone to sexual violence.
I leaned on it once by mistake
and all hell broke loose.
I'm Paola Coletti, Drugs Squad.
Yes, Drugs Squad, but I advise you
either to sit on my bed
or the other Mohamed's bed.
He's more relaxed,
though he has his moments too...
I have a way to get you out of jail.
Yes, I understand, out of jail,
but I...
...Excuse me?
I want you to work for me.
Work...good.
But...
...work in what sense?
Pietro, get the gang back together
and go hunting for smart drugs.
Deliver me 30 substances
that are still legal,
and I promise you freedom
and your record wiped clean.
You'll look for drugs that are not
yet banned and annihilate them.
- Annihilate them ?
- Yes.
Prevent them being produced
in the six months
before the new Ministry of Health
banned list.
How do we know who produces them ?
An analysis should lead you
to the producers.
As a procedure
it seems just a little fanciful !
You don't hold a pill up to the light
and say this is from...
You're a great neurobiologist,
and you have the best computational
chemist in Italy, if you can't...
The best computational chemist
in Italy
at this moment
is detoxing from hard drugs,
and it doesn't seem like a good idea
to have him analyzing hard drugs.
Not to mention
that the great neurobiologist
is here now
because he's in preventive custody.
Yes, but the prison service
is working with us on this.
You'll get all the home visits
you want, I'll sign them myself.
No...
Look, I'm a university researcher,
I've caused enough trouble already.
Then, Giulia...all that...
you don't know,
she's pissed, and she's right.
No, you can't tell Giulia.
This is unofficial.
You don't exist for us, you'll act in
the shadows, you can't tell anyone.
Ah, I can't tell anyone?
No way on earth, then !
"Act in the shadows" !
Do you not want to be with Giulia,
see your son being born ?
Pietro, all the home visits you want.
Honestly, when will you get
another offer like this?
So they give you all
the home visits you want?
Eh, if I'm here...
- And I could get out of rehab?
- If you feel ready.
Of course I feel ready.
You still arguing
with Father Manfredi ?
No, no, of course not.
No, we have a wonderful relationship
based on discussion...
the occasional clash, but only on
how to make the statues of Our Lady.
Alberto, you'll have to deal
with all kinds of drugs every day !
- You can't do like last time!
- Don't worry ! I swear...
- I no longer have a drugs problem !
- Look, this is serious.
We have a unique opportunity,
we can sort out all the chaos
we caused, but we can't mess up.
Pietro, please, get me out of here,
I can't make any more Virgins!
No more whores.
No more 10,000-euro otterskin coats !
No more sports cars.
But, above all, no more drugs!
No whores, no coats, no cars.
Understood.
- No, no drugs!
- No drugs, I swear, I promise.
First fuck-up, you're out !
Yes,
but I need to get back to chemistry,
back in the field.
Then we'll do everything you said...
analyze drugs,
find who makes them, and how,
we find out
and then we go there and...
and... Exactly what do we do then ?
Eh...
Well, have we got the chemist?
Yes, yes, I think so,
I mean...I hope so.
Look, about the intervention...
the actual fieldwork, uh...
there's not enough of us.
I mean, you tell me to annihilate,
but for this kind of work
we need to strengthen the gang.
How do you mean ?
In the sense of extending
the skill set.
We need experts on the subject.
No, wait...
Which subject ? What subjects ?
Can we take a plane?
But what's a plane got to do with
anything ? No. Of course not.
No, we really need to take a plane.
Pietro, are you completely mad ?
You're still a prisoner!
Absolutely not.
Why do you need an plane?
Have you ever heard
of the brain drain ?
Pietro, you've no idea how happy I am
about this unexpected visit !
Me too...
you're looking good...
All these miles you and your new
girlfriend did to see me...
it's an honor.
I told you,
she's not my girlfriend.
BANGKOK - SPICE MARKET
Giulio, to get back to the reason
for our visit...
Because, you know,
when you live abroad, like me,
meeting a fellow countryman
always has an effect.
- I guess...
- Because let's face it,
at university the possibilities
were what they were.
Do you realize ?
A civilized theoretical altercation
on the merits of my research.
OK, there was a physical element...
but of the ten professors involved,
none had a prognosis
of more than 15 days.
- What are we talking about?
- I remember. I wanted...
The reality is that there's no space
for people like us in Italy.
- Yes, but I was telling you
- That is, in Italy...
No, you tell me, because
maybe things have changed.
- Is there space or not?
- There's no space!
Well, then. Don't talk about
the brain drain, is if we'd escaped.
No, we didn't escape,
they kicked us out. That's the truth.
- Yes...yes...
- Anyway it's much better abroad.
There are a lot more possibilities,
you can reinvent yourself.
For an anatomist like me, there are
real opportunities, and well-paid !
I understand, Giulio.
But did you understand
whatl was telling you before?
Pietro, frankly,
I didn't understand a fucking thing.
Listen to me Pietro, look...
I'm risking my career,
a criminal trial to bring you
to fucking Thailand.
So explain to me now what
we're doing with that hippie fuck!
Hippie ? No. No.
That's Giulio Bolle,
world-famous theoretical anatomist.
He has no specialization, he can't
practice, he can't treat people,
but he knows the human body
better than anyone in the world.
Of course, then, not having taken
the Hippocratic Oath,
he carries out his duties
in a manner..I wanna say creative.
That's how he got a criminal record.
Trust me.
Giulio, I understand that this is
a slightly complicated moment,
but I need your attention...
See that guy ?
That is Wang Ho,
here he's practically a legend.
Ten wins in ten matches,
including three brain deaths.
But today I'm going to get him. See?
See how he tilts a little to the left?
Clear compensation due to an
alteration of postural spondylosis,
and quite severe.
I go there now, and give him
a sharp blow at that point.
And he goes down,
he implodes on himself.
A kind of structural collapse,
30, 40 seconds
and then we go to lunch, eh?
Sit down
and you can explain it all again.
- I'm going, eh ! 30, 40...
- Seconds...
Also because in this whole story,
what's in it for me?
A clean criminal record.
But are we sure
we can trust this guy?
Don't be fooled by the unfortunate
dynamic of the match.
Giulio's a genius.
And then we need action people.
I have my doubts about
the next one too.
No, no, no, no.
I can understand Giulio,
talent in the making,
but the next one is an excellence
who is not up for discussion. Ah !
LAGOS - FEDERAL DISTRICT
Right, gentlemen, do we want
to carry out this coup or do we not?
Because if we don't want
to carry it out, we shake hands,
we all go and eat a nice pizza
together, and good night.
If we want to carry it out,
and I say that we do,
then, gentlemen, you need this.
Variable potential device.
The weight and small size
are the result of years and years
of studies on nanotechnologies.
Ergonomic handle, artificial leather,
for a most pleasant transportation
experience. Look at the balance.
This briefcase carries itself, look !
It actually carries you !
For the moment I have it available
in three colors...
black, rifle gray, and, for
the more eccentric, green-aquamarine.
Translate !
Graduate, needless to say,
with top marks
in mechatronic engineering.
Then budget cuts, despair,
exile and recycling.
Today Lucio Napoli
is a lord of low-cost wan
Small revolutions, partial coups
and propaganda are his daily bread.
OK, OK, come on.
I think the gentlemen
have grasped the concept.
So this here, without any problem,
you can place it
at the market, an elementary school, an
embassy and/or government building.
You can leave it on a bus.
You can leave it on the subway.
"What about metal detectors ?"
you might ask.
"Who gives a fuck ?" I'd answer.
Because this little gem here,
gentlemen,
is 100% biodegradable plastic !
But enough chit-chat now, let's talk
about something more interesting...
Low-capacity demonstration charge.
Everybody take a step back, please.
So here's what I'm gonna do, gentlemen.
Using this app,
I arm it,
and using the same app, gentlemen...
...detonation.
Ah, there...
Have you got 3G here?
This is all based on data connection.
It says, "No service".
Absolutely nothing...
All right, let's do this,
only for today and only for you,
next to this little gem
I'll throw in three anti-tank mines!
What more could I do, gentlemen ?
I'm ruining myself!
Get your hands off my neck,
you're ruining my suit!
I've got another three presentations,
I don't want to...
Now it's a mess, are you happy ?
I'll have to throw it away now...
Are you going to shoot or not?
And with this weather as well...!
Will we go back in and talk?
Pietro, I really hope he's worth it.
No, of course he's worth it.
We're almost finished now.
Just one more.
I want to make it clear from the
start, this time I want my lawyer!
If the telephone company
doesn't provide coverage...
VATICAN CITY - ST. PHILLIP APOSTLE COURTHOUSE
You want to be absolved ?
Well, you have to listen to me.
We're going to meet the Cardinal,
and I start with the Second Letter
to the Corinthians,
about sorrow and repentance,
and you make me
a face of sorrow and repentance.
Cardinal softened up, I go in
with the request for clemency.
SPEAKING UKRAINIAN
No, I don't want to hear you talking
about human rights anymore!
In fact, don't you speak at all.
Just do the face of sorrow
and repentance.
SPEAKING UKRAINIAN
No, what... ?
Protesting ?
Don't flash your breasts again,
it bothers the Cardinal.
He's very old,
with major coronary fragility,
and seeing two breasts, quite rightly
might upset him. Come on, let's go.
In conclusion, Your Eminence,
we are more than aware
that my client's political leanings
degenerated into various of fences,
such as obscenity, blasphemy,
and apostasy.
Yet is also true that looking at...
...my client's remorseful expression,
the words of St. Paul come to mind.
"Godly sorrow brings repentance
that leads to salvation".
And with these words, appealing
to the third theological virtue,
I stand here before you,
asking for clemency and indulgence.
He's really good.
SPEAKING LATIN
No, that's fine. That's fine.
SPEAKING UKRAINIAN
- It's best you don't. That's fine.
- Please...
Just a couple of words, be polite.
He won't understand you anyway.
SPEAKING UKRAINIAN
Polite...
SPEAKING UKRAINIAN
You promised...
Not the breasts ! Not the breasts !
Be good !
SPEAKING LATIN
Come on, Your Eminence!
It's just boobs, they never killed anybody !
Come on, Your Eminence!
It's just boobs, they never killed anybody !
Right, I'll answer some of your
questions before you even ask them.
Yes, it's a pretty unusual situation.
Yes, we have some new people here.
Yes, we're in a shooting range
which someone very kindly placed at
our disposal for this first meeting.
Bartolomeo, if the question
is whether you can shoot in here,
the answer's no, otherwise, go on...
Excuse me, Pietro, I don't know
if I can take part in this meeting
because of my ambivalent feelings
towards you.
My unchanged admiration
for you professionally, yes,
but also the certainty
you took us all for a ride.
For the hundredth time,
I did it for you !
- And I took the blame!
- But we're all on trial !
How could I know we'd shoot at a
pharmacist, whom you wanted to kill !
And it seems
I'm the only one in jail, am I not?
Wait, you're in jail?
I didn't get that.
It would've been better to kill him !
Because he's a violent thug !
What ? It was you who fired !
How many times do I have to say
this ? I was nervous...
- What the fuck did you do?
- Lucio, we all have a record now.
But we're here to get rid
of those records !
But you were with me in Africa
a few days ago,
what kind of jail are you in?
I'd just like to clarify
I have no criminal record.
I'm just providing legal support.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean by "shooting" ?
I thought I was strange,
but you seem to have lost it a bit.
I'm sorry, you weren't there, I don't
think it's right to passjudgment
without even an introduction.
Professor Bolle, anatomist, rioting.
Professor Frantini,
classic archeology,
theft of state property.
Nice to meet you.
We'd never have done that robbery
if it hadn't been for Alberto
who lost control
because he's a junkie.
I haven't said a word !
Giorgio, they understood !
The psychologist said...
You're telling me the safety of Rome
is in the hands of these losers?
Are we sure ?
No, we're not,
but they're all we've got!
That's just perfect !
We're here in the presence of Chief
Galatro and Detective Paola Coletti
because there might be a way
to get out of this situation.
Yes, the Detective is a woman...
nothing you haven't already seen
on the internet,
so if you have a question
that's sexist, please don't ask it.
Bartolomeo, if the question's about
the existence of a relationship
between me and the Detective,
it's still a sexist question.
Guys, do you know what I see
in front of me, right now?
Men of letters, scientists...
internationally renowned professors,
the greatest minds around...
All right, we've made mistakes...
...but life is giving us
a second chance.
Let's get the gang back together.
This is the agreement...
we give the Drugs Squad
30 new smart drugs
and we get out of this free
and our records wiped.
Bartolomeo, if the question is
how the fuck do we do that,
the answer is we take it one step
at a time, because it's not like...
Above all,
we have to create a structure.
We need a place,
because we can't come back here.
And we need a laboratory,
a base where we can work in peace,
like the last place anyone
would think of coming to look for us.
I know it seems high,
but it's just for a moment.
We all did it. Don't be a coward !
Stop your nonsense, please !
Well, what do you think?
The new subway...so what?
Yes, a site for the new line I had
closed because of the finds here.
And knowing the Superintendence,
nobody will come here for a year!
But what I meant was, what do you
think of this Corinthian capital?
Well, an extraordinary
Republican contamination
revealed by the triumph
of the decoration.
- Profoundly contaminated.
- Really ?
So you're the asshole who stopped
the works on the new subway ?
That's right, he's the asshole !
Your attitude continues
to be most unhelpful.
What do you want from me?
He said it !
This isn't right for us !
It's like a Welsh coal mine
before there were unions !
Pietro, no names,
but people are attacking me unfairly.
- I'm talking about work!
- There !
Guys, we need a lift, a pole, or
something ! Or else I'm out of here!
We need a contract, black on white.
I checked some of the analogous
case law to get an idea.
They're not easy to track down,
but luckily it's all been ratified
in the Vatican.
A good starting point might be
the contract with the Magiiana Gang,
though you'll have to remove
the paragraphs about the bombings
and the neofascist underground.
I don't think it fits in
with our modus operandi...
or does it ?
This is Zinni's release form.
At the 30th substance,
it'll be signed and the case closed.
Fine...we can use these
some other time...let's say.
We have them ready.
And obviously a lab to see
how the substances are made
and so figure out
where they come from.
You'll agree with me we don't have
the margins here for decontamination,
and the hygiene conditions are very
similar to the kitchen where I was,
if not even worse.
- You're absolutely right.
- But there were specific requests.
I needed a mass spectrometer, an NMR,
an element analyzer, reactants...
You've given me four Chinese buckets !
Alberto, this is important:
in your condition, do you feel
you can handle drugs, without using?
Of course ! Don't you trust me?
Of course !
I'm like a gynecologist!
What do you mean?
It's not that every time
a gynecologist sees a...
- A what?
- Something he likes !
- What a fucking example!
- Ok, ok, I got it wrong !
Give me something to analyze!
Let's get started !
Good evening.
You got something for me?
Coke ? Speed ? Ecstasy ?
Something a bit more sophisticated.
You got any smart drugs?
What ?
Smart drugs. Drugs made with
a molecule that's not illegal yet.
Like Sopox ? Who the fuck are you ?
Get the fuck out of here !
Right, you need to give me
all the legal substances you have.
Then I need to know
where you get them,
if you've got even a simple chemical
analysis, that's fine,
tell me where they come from...
just tell me everything you know.
Right, the first one's a stimulant,
made by acetylating chloride acetyl
with synephrine,
an alkaloid extracted
from orange skins.
The psychotropic effect
is limited and short-term.
The problem is how it's cut,
because these amateurs,
to save a bit of money,
cut it with synthetic cathinones.
- No !
- Yes.
- Bath salts?
- I know, it's embarrassing !
Instead what's really interesting
is this one called Sopox,
because right from the first tests
this has been reacting strangely...
Let's go back a minute.
Orange peel, you said ?
What kind ?Any kind?
No, bitter oranges, non-edible ones.
They extract the synephrine,
which is the precursor.
All drugs have a precursor.
Follow the precursor, find the drug.
The pusher said he gets those pills
from a guy in Torre Angela.
OK, so we got something...
We know the precursor is synephrine,
extracted from bitter orange peels.
And in some way this guy in
Torre Angela is involved. Excellent.
What do we do ? Check every cellar
in Torre Angela for smart drugs?
Follow the money.
If the precursor really is legal,
there'll be receipts.
So it's dead easy
to trace the cash flow.
Excellent !
We just have to...
what do you mean,
trace the cash flow ?
Pao-Mo. The Chinese bubble.
I could talk to you about that,
about how with Shanghai at -9,
the cash flows have departures
and destinations
of a clarity that's moving.
But let's get to the point...
The market is based on supply
and demand.
Someone sells, someone buys.
Sol asked myself,
how many producers
of non-edible oranges are there? Eh ?
Not many.
One. A guy in Catania, a wholesaler.
Guess how many customers he has.
- One !
- No, or he wouldn't be a wholesaler.
But one in Rome, a herbalist.
Guess where this shop is !
Torre Angela.
Torre Angela,
and we have the address.
It's in here, let's go.
How do you mean "Let's go" ?
What we agreed to.
We go in and prevent them
from continuing.
"Prevent them from continuing" is
still somewhat nebulous as a concept.
If the preconditions are unclear...
What's unclear?
We have to go in and say...
...what the fuck do I know ?
Stop, police !
No fucking way ! I'm not using
far-right language like that!
- So what will we say?
- Something simple, like "Enough !"
- What do you mean ?
- In a strong and authoritative tone.
"Enough !ll NO
- Never mind. Any other options?
- Excuse me a moment.
A doubt has sprung to mind. I'm not
entirely sure I closed the van.
You're not sure ?You have to worry
about one thing, the van !
And because I do worry about that,
it came to me !
What do you mean?
All my stuff's in there...
- D'you remember me going like this?
- No...
Oi ! That's enough ! We're like
a bunch of kids on a school trip!
We've done worse things than this!
We're scared of four orange pushers ?
Giulio, come with me. Follow me.
- Excuse me.
- Of course.
- Want a hand ?
- No !
Pivot !
Come on, raise the shutters !
He“) me!
We have to shut everything down,
fuck the agreement !
It's too risky !
Did you read this?
- Shoot-out atTorre Angela ! Us !
- No !
Read it properly.
"Clash between low-lever pushers
connected to local mob".
"Low-level", bullshit ! I'm calling
HQ to shut everything down.
If you read to the end, it says,
and I quote, "Police seized
an amphetamine laboratory".
Sometimes journalists don't always
get it completely right.
The molecule was C12H11N20,
a molecule which is still legal,
but won't be for long.
The gang's working. This is good !
You should be happy.
There were three shots.
That guy could have been killed.
How would we justify a prisoner
being shot in the 'burbs?
Now you're just being a pessimist !
The gang's settling in,
they're getting there.
As for the prisoner, he's fine,
it was just a scratch.
I'm fine.
It's just a scratch.
And...how did you get this scratch ?
The usual way you get scratches...
You undervalue the danger
of a situation,
and if you're very, very,
very, very lucky,
you only get a scratch.
Pietro, you got raped, didn't you ?
Right, for the hundredth time,
since the time when I accidentally
sat on Mohammed's bed,
there have been no attempts at abuse,
which is different from rape,
as you know.
Giulia...I've got home leave.
As much asl want!
We can have a normal life. And soon
I'll be out, with no criminal record.
Remember you said you'd never lie
to me again.
Exactly ! Exactly... Test me.
Let's do something normal.
Let's go to lunch.
What...when?
Soon as you like.
A normal thing like normal people do.
Lunch...
Giulia, no more weird stuff,
I promise !
Giulia, no more weird stuff,
I promise !
Here we are !
Right, gentlemen, 20 years
of experimental engineering theses
are contained herein.
The right equipment will make sure
there will be no more Torre Angela.
And here we have everything we need.
For example, they shot at you ?
Well, you need a bullet-proof vest.
Here !
Polyethylene glycols
combined with powdered silica.
Liquid armor, in effect.
What happens?
The silica combined with the giycois
remains in a liquid state
until it gets hit by a moving object.
Of course. The kinetic energy
compacts the silica molecules
and the liquid becomes harder
than steel. Good, that might work.
Of course it will !
This was conceived for the army,
but the brother-in-law of the Defense
Minister makes bullet-proof jackets,
so in the end nothing happened.
Low-intensity Taser, solar-powered.
This is only a small part
of a wider project of eco-friendly
guerrilla warfare.
Guys, I love you, but don't touch
everything, it's fragile.
They're engineering theses,
they'll break.
Gentlemen, have you seen these?
They're beautiful !
These...
They're really beautiful, these...
what are they?
Radial airless tires.
They can't be punctured
and require no maintenance.
They're designed to last
as long as the car, if not longer.
That's a gem !
Degree course 2007-10.
Acoustic shock-wave cannon,
designed to destroy hail at ground
level before the hail destroys crops.
It would have increased agricultural
output by 14-15%,
but the funding for the project
was switched
to repair the geology department
waste pipe.
Well, they have to shit as well.
Pietro ?
You know what all this means, yeah?
Yeah...we're about to die.
No...
...it means we're back!
Ah, a distiller!
Now we're talking !
This is from the Torrino warehouse.
- Put it next to the centrifuge.
- Right.
- That blender thing you got
at Quadraro ! - Right!
C12H17N0 STILL A LEGAL MOLECULE.
LOW-QUALITY EXCIPIENTS
PLEASE ALERT MINISTRY OF HEALTH
You boosted the engine,
titanium-alloy suspension,
racing suspension...
you want to put that huge thing on, too?
You going to war?
What's so strange ? It's a
straightforward kangaroo guard,
very common in rural Australia.
This is Rome !
Then after lunch we need to put on
these tires, airless, great stuff !
GANG WARFARE SPREADS
This is a solution you take in drops
on a basis of tetrodotoxin,
really dangerous stuff,
extracted from puffer fish.
Just think, the drug's legal,
so's tetrodotoxin...the fish isn't!
- Meaning ?
- The puffer fish is illegal.
But a few places have a permit
to buy it, a few Asian restaurants.
Good morning, Professor.
The amazing thing about Sopox
is its optical purity,
because from ephedrine these guys
should get another stereoisomer.
And ephedrine's illegal
so they extract it from somewhere.
But what ?And how?
Alberto, what about the other drugs?
Well, there's this...
a hallucinogen with a psilocybin,
which you find in mushrooms.
What kind of mushrooms?
Those used for cluster headaches,
for example, or rheumatic pain.
But to attain a psychotropic effect
you need a really high concentration.
Lots of mushrooms...
lots of farmed mushrooms...
Hello ? Good evening.
Unfortunately there was a problem
with the mushroom beds we ordered.
No, the problem is I've lost the bit
of paper with the order number,
so you might have the wrong address.
Via Baronio 187.
That's the address, that's us !
You've been very helpful.
The clinic people?
Yes...yes...
Of course. Thank you. Thank you.
The clinic... ?
Right, suspected mycotic production
in a public place.
We don't know where the lab is, but
we think the nurses are producing it.
- Put this on.
- What's this for?
They took on new staff last week,
they'll think we're new.
What kind of clinic is it?
Mine!
Excuse me, there's no smoking here.
I know, but the situation demands it.
I'm sorry,
I've got a pulmonary hypertrophy.
Who are you, anyway?
I've never seen you in here.
You don't look like a nurse!
Then I lost my wife in the British
air raid in May in San Lorenzo.
May ?Your wife died in July,
the 19th to be precise.
And the air raids were the work
of the US Air Force, not the RAF.
You got your history all wrong !
N°r no, no ! Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Fuck off !
Fuck off...!
Fuck off !
OK, you Sopox bastard...
...you don't wanna be analyzed ?
Let's see where you can go !
They didn't extend
my research contract.
Don't worry, in three months they'll
start again with twice the money.
They won't let you get away !
What am I gonna do now?
Yes, you're right !
I'm mortified.
I'll clean it right away !
You shouldn't be doing things
like that,
because you're a university
professor, Alberto,
and you deserve more.
Well, you know whatl mean...
Limited edition, 4200, petrol,
sure, it's high consumption,
but you'll have fun with this!
I'll take it!
I'm a jerk and aprovdanie!
But as regards the moral and academic
caliber of my colleagues, I can't...
Fuck!
Alberto, what the fuck?
"I'm clean ! I'm clean !"
Pietro, I know what they've got !
Giulio, it's not Guantanamo!
Bring him round, don't torture him !
I'm trying to reduce the temperature
of his cerebral cortex.
I'm narrowing the veins
to reduce the psychotropic effect.
It's a chromatograph !
Sopox is made with a chromatograph !
I tried it,
it was the only way to do it.
But now I know it's a chromatograph !
Fuck you ! We're this close
to getting our records wiped,
and you just fucked it up!
And you promised me !
No, I saw the chromatograph,
the day of the crash !
I was in the car and the
chromatograph went past ! I saw it !
Alberto, stop !
You're out of the gang ! You happy?
- Nowl know how to do it!
- He's still high ! Back in!
- No, Pietro !
- Deep breath !
Listen...what was that guy's name,
the one you were with there?
- Fame.
- Fabm. Oi course.
The famous Fabio.
Say thanks to him from me for what
he's doing, when he went with you...
Bloody hell, he's handsome too.
Well, he's kinda cute...
I don't know.
Cute, no, no.
Objectively, he's handsome.
He's got an algebraic body,
he must do some kind of sport.
No, when he's not in Gaza with DWB
he helps us out at the centre.
Mostly he stays at home...
reading, writing, painting...
Well, of course. Painting.
Are you jealous?
Who, me ?Are you kidding, Giulia?
And of what?
Some guy who saves children
from the horrors of war
and paints in his free time?
And I'd like to see how he paints !
No, he's good.
Last month he'd his own exhibition.
One of his paintings
has been shown at the Reina Sofia.
Yeah, whatever. But for the next
ultrasound, I'd like to be there.
It's at 8 in the morning.
How can you ?
What d'you mean ?I make a note
of it, set the alarm and come.
Pietro, why do you get
all these home visits?
Well, it's really a bit
of a complicated calculation.
It's the sum of good behavior,
with the softer regime plus holidays,
which aren't really holidays,
so... But anyway... Don't worry.
Instead, your job...how's it going ?
Fine.
There's been a big drop-off
in smart drugs.
Apart from this Sopox
which is all the rage now.
There must be some weird gang war
going on...
Why weird ?
Maybe there's a gang
of good, righteous guys,
on the side of right,
a lovely story of redemption...
Good ? Righteous ?
They're drug dealers, Pietro.
If they're shooting each other, fine.
- Let's hope nobody gets killed.
- For sure !
Unfortunately we have to report
that car and motorbike theft
showed a significant 1.6% increase.
No great change in burglaries,
down 0.3% for physiological reasons
that have nothing to do with us.
Drug trafficking down 25%
and smart drugs down 65%.
Assault, no change.
Right, that's the lot.
If there are no questions,
we'll see you again at the next
quarterly conference. Thank you.
I'd like to ask a question,
excuse me.
Please.
About the smart drugs,
I wanted to know
if you could give us any details
about the operations?
What kind of details?
By definition
smart drugs are legal.
So how can the police investigate
something that's still legal ?
I didn't catch the name
of your paper.
No, I'm a freelancer.
I read about the more than 20 new
molecules removed from the market,
and, unlike other operations,
the MO of the police isn't clear.
That's why I wanted details,
I don't know...
any special agreements,
the officers involved...
For the details I'll hand over
to Detective Paola Coletti
who deals with the logistical side.
Yes...thank you for the question
which is very relevant.
But I've learned that the police
need to be careful with details
when dealing with ongoing operations.
Don't you think it would be handy
for the criminals
if we provide details of our MO ?
I realize it's physiological
for a conspiracy-theorist biog,
as I imagine yours is,
to look for the unconventional angle,
but I can assure you it's a very
banal and dull police operation,
which is also coming to an end.
Speed up !
Get these two, it's our last bust
and we're through !
You sure you want me to speed up?
Artti, this thing's a sloth !
You said you got it fixed !
A sloth ?
What's that ?
Hold on tight!
What's happening ?
I switched on the NOS !
What the fuck's a NOS ?
Protoxide of nitrogen, a comburent
that increases detonation.
When the fuck did you mounted it?
- Fuck, the police !
- What do you mean ?
Sorry, I thought we were the police?
Giorgio, this is the last substance !
Are you thick ?We don't exist!
- Pull over!
- No way ! No!
We get a speeding ticket
and fucking walk!
It might not be that simple!
Of course not!
Cos you'd the brilliant idea
of adding two canisters of highly
inflammable protoxide of nitrogen !
- Exactly !
- Exactly, my ass ! That's a felony !
Can I point out that I only satisfied
your request for more speed ?
Can I point out that I'm on parole
and if they get me they throw away the key !
All right, all right.
[SPEAKING LATIN]
Or even better, I'd say...
[SPEAKING LATIN]
No !
[SPEAKING LATIN]
It's really quick.
What about Trajan's edict banning
traffic through Porta Latina ?
What the fuck are you saying ?
Are these Roman roads ?
Not the Rome you know !
This is so cool !
Did you see that ? How do you guys
come up with these things?
If they were throwing away keys
before, now it's lethal injection !
Get rid of them !
Take the Sepulcra Scipionum
and go right.
We'll end up
in the Termae Severianae !
The second right, not the first!
- Turn, turn !
- Turn, turn !
All right ! I'm turning!
- Oh, my God !
- Calm !
- What have I done ?
- Nothing !
What sin have I committed ?
Kill me ! Kill me!
Hands back on the wheel and drive!
We stopped the cops !
This is the best day of my life!
Go to Porta Latina,
we'll get them there.
I'm almost certain it was
an imperial copy, not an unicum !
- It was an unicum...
- No, it wasn't. Listen to him.
- It was an unicum...
- No, it wasn't. Fuck it!
Now the other one's an unicum !
But so fucking what?
Get after that motorbike ! I've got
the gynaecologist in two hours !
- There they are ! Andrea !
- What?
Do something ! Shoot their tires!
Shoot their tires ! Are you mad ?
How do I shoot them ?
Pull over ! I'm armed
with an ultrasound anti-hail cannon
and I'm not afraid to use it!
Ok, you asked for it...
Fuck-all happened !
What an assholel look !
Look on the bright side,
there won't be any hail for a while.
Good morning.
I have a morphological scan
the name is Zinni.
Yes...
Not me, I mean, my partner.
A joke...sometimes they work,
sometimes no.
I'm sorry,
there's no booking in that name.
That's very strange.
Maybe she used her own name.
Can you check again ?
Sometimes on the phone, Zinni...
Love ! Here I am !
Here I am ! You finished already ?
This is the best lab in Rome
in terms of punctuality !
Not so good at reception, though.
The girl's a bit confused.
So, how's the kid doing?
You wanna do something crazy ?
What if we go back in
and see a bit of the scan again?
OK, I got it wrong, I'm sorry,
I'm late.
But I promise you, Giulia,
this is a very complicated moment,
and then the trouble I had
getting here...
I'd to cut through
the archaeological park.
Is that blood ?
Yes, yes, it is, but don't worry,
it's not mine.
It's dark, it's venous...
But this...
this here, this is mine...
You can see how it's a much brighter
red. This is arterial. I know,
you'll be asking
how come I've got my own blood,
and, above all, someone else's,
on me...
and I'll try
the usual, pathetic clutching...
No, Pietro, I don't care.
I don't care
why you're covered in blood,
I don't care why you go in and
out of jail like it was a hotel...
and I don't care why you're late...
and left me on my own...
Giulia, it's all over.
After today that's it.
I helped a Drugs Squad detective,
which is why I got
all these home visits.
I'm coming home on Monday.
We'll start again
exactly where we left off.
From that day when we decided to buy
a dishwasher.
Do you think they can give me
a couple of stitches here?
I really could use a couple
of stitches right away.
Hang on, I'll ask the lady here.
The consignment of the 30th substance
ends the relationship
between my clients
and the Sesto Tiburtino Police.
And we move on to the ratification
of the release of Pietro Zinni
in line with the undertakings given,
canceling the trial,
in nomine Domini AD 2014!
I ended up the way I usually do.
Since it's not an official act,
I took a few liberties.
All right.
Let's sign.
Let's sign.
All right.
So, are we good ?
The release will be ratified Monday
with immediate effect.
I guess you had nothing to do with
the destruction of Hadrian's Market?
No, really, a great result.
The 30th substance.
Well done.
Though out of 30 smart drugs, you and
your gang got nowhere near Sopox !
But you don't give a fuck, do you?
It's just a career trampoline
for you.
You got 30, you won, that's enough.
One drug's the same as another.
I don't know what you're getting at.
- Sopox has almost vanished.
- Is that not good news?
You know perfectly well
they're upping the price.
Then in a few weeks it'll be back,
ten times as much of it.
And at that point we'll all realize,
including HQ.
And all this song and dance
will have been pointless.
After all
the gang couldn't do anymore.
Ratify that release, we'll forget
all this and get back to work!
The Magliana Researchers !
Bloody hell...at my age!
Speech!
- Speech ! Speech !
- All right...
All right, there is something
that needs to be said,
because some things need to be said.
Now that it's over, if I look back,
and think about everything we did,
what stands out is one clear
and recurring thought...
that is, we are so incredibly cool !
Do you realize what we've done?
To not be able to talk about it
is so incredibly frustrating !
Right, if you all have
spotless records now,
you owe it
to Detective Paola Coletti !
Speech ! Speech ! Speech !
The head of police didn't sign.
He wants you get Sopox.
A round of applause
for that typical police humor!
A touch inappropriate, but...
Can I speak to you a moment?
Will you quickly explain
what's going on ?
If it was a joke, bad taste
and all that, but fair enough,
but if it's true it's a big problem.
No, Pietro, all that's happened is
the substances have gone up to 31.
I have a signed document
ending the relationship.
You know better than me
that's fucking worthless.
What ? What did we have the lawyer
for, then ?
It says, "In nomine Domini".
What's that about?
That's just a formality.
You mean she's right?
In effect,
there was a lack of clarity here...
Excuse me,
now I'm going to be pissed.
I had a flourishing business
with clients.
Sure, there were occasional
misunderstandings,
a little this for that,
but it was going well.
Then you came
and fed me all this bullshit!
What bullshit ? It was all true.
It is all true.
The contract's still 100% valid.
I just need one more substance.
But it's one we know nothing about!
Yes, but Sopox exists.
They have to make it somewhere.
If anyone can find out,
it's you guys.
Pietro, do it for me. Find Sopox
and go home to Giulia and the baby!
No, I was already supposed to be home
with Giulia and the baby !
And how can I be sure that after
finding Sopox, there isn't another?
Because whether you believe it
or not,
this has been one of the best things
I've ever done !
Have you seen yourselves ?You're
the greatest brains out there !
Yes, society put you in a corner,
then prison, I brought you together.
Let's finish in style!
I know you want it as much as I do!
Get Sopox, and everyone's free.
If you think you can make us change
our minds with a couple of cliches
which by the way are so over, you
don't know who you're dealing with !
All we want to do is get back
to our old lives. Tell her!
Guys, are you being shy?
You can talk to the Detective,
you don't need to worry.
Pietro...I'm not really in a hurry
to get back to my old life.
What was my old life?
I don't know anymore.
What do you mean,
you're not in a hurry?
Honestly, I felt more socially useful
in these last few months, Pietro,
than in 24 years
working as a researcher.
All I've got waiting for me at home
is a camel.
Guys, what the fuck are you saying?
We did all this to be free!
To be able to get home.
It's easy for you !
You're going back to Giulia,
you're going to have a baby...
but what will we do ? Start again
washing dishes, serving gas... ?
What do you want?
You're out the gang !
- And who decided that, you ?
- Yeah, me, cos you got high again !
And who the fuck are you to decide?
I'm here because some asshole came
to get me at the Chinese restaurant!
You came of your own free will,
nobody forced you !
You said we'd get rich,
and look at us!
If we're here it's cos you crashed,
whored about and got stoned !
No, if we're here it's because
we'd to save your girl from Murena,
and I crashed because I saw
a fucking chromatograph ! Fuck you !
What did he see?
He's convinced that to make Sopox
you need this fancy chromatograph
which he says he saw
the night he crashed.
Obviously it makes no sense using
such costly equipment to make drugs.
We tried to understand how they
synthesized it, but without success.
All we know is the basis of Sopox is
ephedrine, but ephedrine's illegal.

Detective Coletti !
Hi, Alice Gentili. I don't know if
you remember the press conference...
If you have a minute I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions off the record.
- How did you get in here?
- This is a public building.
This is a private area.
You shouldn't be here.
Do you know Pietro Zinni ?
Spinelli, there's someone here who
shouldn't be. Where the fuck is he?
Do you know Pietro Zinni or not?
I don't know what you're talking
about. No, I don't know him.
Well, I'll tell you...
Pietro Zinni was one of the first
producers of smart drugs in Rome.
Accused of various crimes,
he's now in jail
awaiting a trial which is constantly
being put off for various reasons.
Meanwhile Zinni comes and goes
from jail as he likes.
Isn't that strange?
How would I know?
Why are you asking me these things?
Because you sign his home visits.
So we have a prisoner who comes and
goes as he pleases from jail, right?
It's called conditional release,
it's in the penal code. Read it !
Well, Articles 176 and 177
of the Penal Code...
What the fuck do you want?
Is there a link between Zinni's
unusual circumstances
and the collapse of smart drugs?
I can't say anything...
No ! Absolutely not!
No comment about anything.
Don't you think it's handy
for the conspiracy-theorist press
omitting the details of your MO?
Listen...you have no idea of
the minefield you're stepping into !
Keep away from my gang,
you understand ?
- So I'll write no?
- Write fuck off !
"Keep away from my gang" !
Good one, Sheriff!
Last May, accident with presumed
robbery, that was yours, wasn't it?
Yes, it's in that paper in your hand.
What did they steal ? It doesn't say.
It doesn't say because someone died.
The delivery note was never found.
That's manslaughter
not a robbery report.
But it says, "sophisticated machinery
stolen". What was it?
It was for the university.
They don't have an inventory.
And who cares about four vials?
Someone died. What do you care?
Because I think
it's connected to Sopox.
You're losing control.
Ambition, your career,
I can understand that.
But obsession's dangerous.
Be careful, Coletti, be careful !
Pietro, do you know
what day it is today?
I'm not really sure right now,
but as you know the perception
of time in jail is pretty random...
it stretches...
- Saturday !
- ..It shortens...
You said you were coming home
last Monday, didn't you?
And I will be soon. There was a small
delay, a bureaucratic problem...
Pietro, I'm in my 40th week,
your child is about to be born,
and you're still feeding me
bullshit!
What a fool !
When you said you were getting out,
for a moment, in the grip of
my raging hormones, I believed you !
- Giulia...
- Don't say a thing !
You're chronic liar,
a catalyst of catastrophe,
and the last person
to think of having a child with !
If I'd thought about it,
I'd have taken the pill !
But not one, 10, 50...
- 100.
- Yes !
You see what happens?
You take it too far !
This isn't you ! But it's normal !
It's hormones and I understand that!
What do you mean, 50 pills, Giulia?
The pill...
Of course !
The contraceptive pill !
Of course.
- Listen, Giulia, I need to go.
- Pietro...
No, I'll be there,
the birth, the check-ups...
just call me.
But I need to go now.
Visit's over! You need to call me
Detective Paola Coletti, Drugs Squad.
Tell her it's Pietro Zinni.
Don't look at me, dial the number
Contraceptive pills !
- You know what they're for?
- Not having babies !
To extract ephedrine.
If Alberto's right,
Sopox is based on ephedrine.
Ephedrine's illegal,
almost impossible to find
except in the pill
which is full of it.
So that's where they get it.
Wednesday night the biggest load
of contraceptive pills
of the quarter is going to be
delivered at Civitavecchia
That's when you move.
To say this you went and got a packet
of contraceptive pills ?
I'm afraid to ask where you got it.
Always the drama queen, aren't you?
The pills arrive in a container in
three days at Civitavecchia harbor
They will be put on a train
for Ostiense station,
where a number of trucks
will take them to the pharmacies.
The vulnerable point
is just before they're distributed.
Whoever is making Sopox
will act then.
We'll go to the harbor,
find the load,
stick a GPS on it,
and follow it right to the lab
where they're producing the Sopox.
Follow the precursor
and you'll find the drug.
We've done much more complex things,
haven't we ?
Right, me, Giulio, Giorgio and Mattia
go and recce...
No, Andrea, this time we all go.
Alberto, you should come with me.
The great Alberto in action !
Sorry, Pietro, there's a problem.
You say we all go,
but how are we going to do that?
The axle shaft of the van is broken
and the brake pump is busted.
Not to mention the engine...
Arturo, transport is your department.
Come up with something !
Well, what do you say?
What...?You...?
What can I say ?I mean...
Gentlemen, are you really saying... ?
If you really can't find
anything better...
Better ?
There's nothing better than this !
They're masterpieces of engineering !
They survived
the Montecassino bombing !
Yeah...it's just it'll be difficult
not to be noticed.
Why ?
I'm sorry, but for me
there are insurmountable political,
moral and ideological issues here.
If you mean the symbols,
we can discuss that,
buy you know better than me
they refer to lots of cultures
and allude to the continuity
and cycle of life. Bartolomeo?
I call shotgun !
Did you just slap me?
Sorry, I was trying to hit the vagus
nerve for a controlled collapse...
How the fuck did you get in here?
- No !
- Security !
- Elettra, container 19.
- OK.
This guy had situs inversus!
- Weird !
- He what?
Never mind. Go, go.
Is he all right?
We haven't killed another one?
No, he's fine.
No, the other time...well,
a pharmacist...I was really jumpy.
For side effects, I'd wait 48 hours.
- Of course.
- But I don't expect complications.
- Oi ! Come on !
- Go, go, go!
10,11,12,13,14,15,1eH.
17,18...
...and 19.
- The one on top?
- What's the problem ?
Open the container, pick a box in the
middle, put the GPS in, come down.
- It's not that hard.
- And you're covering us?
This is an anthropological category
I can manage with my eyes closed !
Helmet.
Hold tight !
Hey, lard-ass !
Loot at that belly !
What the hell happened to you ?
You don't recognize me?
We went for a meal at Zozzone.
Zozzone ?
Bruttone, Bruttone ! Yeah...
Bruttone ?
Buiaccaro ?
I don't remember...
Chiappetta ?
- Maybe !
- Now you're acting shy!
I remember it well ! Bloody hell !
Give me a cigarette, fatty !
Here...
You look so old now !
And then I said...
stop acting crazy... If it wasn't for
us, you'd have to close the harbor.
- You said that?
- Right in his face!
You're the greatest !
And then thanks to that, like today,
the day before a holiday,
we send the trains away an hour early
so we can get home sooner!
An hour earlier ! What a great idea !
You get it?
Excuse me...
Could you explain this little trade
union detail which is new to me?
What? For three months now, before
holidays, we send the loads early.
Early ?I knew nothing about this!
Explain it to me.
All the union work we did,
the petition, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry... Thank you.
Hurry! The trains
are leaving an hour earlier.
- I realized.
- Where's Mattia ?
Inside.
- In the container ?The GPS?
- No, I've got that.
Fuck, no, GPS inside,
Mattia outside !
- You can't do shit!
- That's easy to say here !
Quiet ! I need to concentrate,
please. Don't make any noise!
Come, come, come...
Go, go, go ! That's the way. Go!
Slowly.
On you come down.
Watch... Go.
All right...
Carlo, where the fuck were you ?
I was talking to this guy...
Listen, tell me, that time
we went for dinner at Chiappetta,
do you remember a tall guy
with a handlebar mustache?
If just once
they didn't leave them open !
What was that?
Nothing, let's get home.
Just close it up.
They've got a chromatograph !
They've got a chromatograph !
Alberto,
this is like Chinese water torture !
- I was right about the ephedrine!
- You're still a pain in the ass!
Hello, Andrea?
There was a little problem,
but everything's under control !
- What happened ?
- Mattia's in the container.
Great, and the GPS?
The GPS isn't. We've got it.
We didn't know the train
was leaving early.
- Where's Mattia ?
- On the train...unfortunately.
Holy shit !
You call this a little problem ?
How fucking complicated was it?
GPS inside, Mattia outside !
This has all already been stated
quite firmly.
- What do we do now?
- That's why I was calling.
What the fuck do I know?
Right, I need to think...
Don't lose sight of Mattia.
We're on our way.
What the fuck... ?
- Giulia ?
- My contractions have started.
All right, love, that's normal
at this point of pregnancy.
How often ?
45 seconds.
45 seconds ?
No, then. You need to go to hospital.
No shit !
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I've been calling you for 30 minutes.
I even asked at the jail.
I'm out just now,
I had a little situation...
Giulia, I'll call you back.
I've got an important call.
Hello ?
There must be a problem. The GPS
says the pills are going back.
No, the train left early.
We've got the GPS,
Mattia is in the container.
I'm sorting things.
There's a Latinist in the container,
and you say you're sorting things?
- Latinist outside, GPS inside.
- That's what I said too !
If they find Mattia
they'll be on to you in an instant.
How will you explain the Latinist
in a container?
I've got half an idea.
I'll call you back.
Hello ?
Oh, what the fuck!
Mattia's in 19 !
Why isn't he coming out?
It's a cargo train,
it only opens from the outside.
What's the fucking problem ?
Let's get him out of here!
- With the train moving?
- What's it doing, 60?
Close in, I'll handle it. Go.
What's he doing ?
- He says it's doing 60.
- So what ?
Guys, Bartolomeo's dead !
- Oh, come on !
- Someone go and help him !
There's a train in the way !
Bartolomeo's gone,
let's worry about Mattia.
We have to use the trapdoor
on the roof.
But he's a human being.
Yeah, but he's dead now.
- We'll get him later!
- Later, when ?
He might not be dead.
Even Admetus in the Alcestis
went down...
Fuck Admetus !
Pass me the GPS !
You wanna free Mattia
or put the GPS in?
How the fuck do I know?
Let's try and do both ! Hold this !
- I don't feel up to it!
- Don't break my balls ! Hold it!
- Be careful.
- Yeah...
Motherfucker !
Who the fuck are you ?
I have to get the pills.
Here ?You were supposed to get them
at the station !
There's CCTV at the station. Move !
All right, I'll be honest.
Point 1, the molecule
is great it seems, well done.
Point 2...
why the fuck would I everjump on
a local train at 6 in the morning?
But unfortunately my girlfriend
is giving birth right now
and I can't go back to jail
for any reason,
so even if it kills me, you're not
getting these fucking pills...!
Thank you for saving me!
Are you crazy ?
What's happening ?
Nothing ! We've got 10 minutes.
Move !
Put those pills down !
Put those pills down !
You miserable piece of shit!
This is a fucking disaster!
We've lost a great academic
and a sidecar from '39 that belongs
to the state! I'll be fired !
- Relax, we'll get the sidecar later.
- Fuck the sidecar !
No, guys, we can still do it.
We still have the GPS !
Where are we meant to put it?
I don't know...in the van!
Let's put it in the van !
It can be done.
We attach it with a magnet!
- Where will be get a magnet?
- We're sitting on one !
Take the horn off.
It's near the tank.
- Eh ?
- The horn's a magnet.
Guys...
- That's the engine, higher up!
- I found the engine!
Guys, I'm ready to be rescued here,
you know ?What are you doing?
- We have a plan !
- Another one?
Would it not be better to go home
and accept defeat?
Metro, pass the GPS to Mama.
- You sure?
- Time's running out, move!
Give.
There's a magnet at the back.
Tie it to the GPS.
Tie it !
Throw it at the van !
Throw it !
Mattia, throw it ! Throw it, go!
Wait a moment! Calm down !
So!
Bartolomeo !
What are you doing there?
I've been calling you
for half an hour!
- Bartolomeo, you're alive !
- What is this thing ?
- A magnet. Stick it onto the van !
- I'll try !
Guys, Bartolomeo's alive !
I told you !
Wait, it's dangerous.
Coming !
Go, go !
Who the fuck was that, Prof?
Pietro Zinni.
Nobody. Turn around.
KEEP AWAY FROM MY GANG AGREEMENT BETWEEN
CRIMINAL GANG AND POLICE EXPOSED
KEEP AWAY FROM MY GANG AGREEMENT BETWEEN
CRIMINAL GANG AND POLICE EXPOSED
We did it!
I don't know how, but we did it!
We've located the van.
We're going there now.
What van ?
Pietro, we have to stop everything !
Hang on a moment.
I need to go. Wait!
No, wait, Pietro !
Fuck!
Hello, love !
I don't know why I keep calling,
but I'm about to give birth to
your son in case you're interested !
No, I'm interested. I'm almost there.
I'm almost done, I'm coming.
Yeah, right...
You read this?
It's just a blog, nobody reads that !
An agreement between criminals
and us.
It even quotes you
from the other night!
There's even a link
to an audio recording.
It's a fucking silly blog !
You know what names are in it?
Mine...and I don't give a fuck...
- And mine, and I do give a fuck!
- Listen...
No, you listen !
Now we're going to do something.
We've never seen this gang
of researchers,
never heard of them,
never signed anything.
You just have to say no
to all their questions.
No to everything,
or it's gonna be a shitstorm soon !
And if I end up in shit, Coletti,
you'll drown in it!
- Where the fuck are they?
- They're looking...
- Where the fuck are they?
- They...
- Where the fuck are they?
- The Sopox lab.
You tell me like this?
This is great!
- It's nothing to do with them.
- This changes everything.
Where is this lab?
- It's in there.
- What is this place?
What do you care?
Come on, my son's being born.
I don't want him to be pissed at me
from day 1.
With me, Lucio, Alberto and Giulio!
Guys, it's in here.
There's nobody here. Is that normal ?
Dunno.
What did I tell you, Pietro?
The chromatograph !
This is how they extract
the ephedrine, I told you.
But it's so expensive, it's absurd.
A chromatograph that size
costs over 500,000 euros...
to make pills?
It doesn't make sense.
The ephedrine is oxidized
with N-Chiorosuccinimide
and demethyl sulfide. It's genius!
It's not genius.
It doesn't make sense.
Maybe the guy found himself with the
chromatograph and decided to use it?
That would make sense.
- They found the magnet.
- What... ?
They knew we were following them,
that's why nobody's here.
You know what...
it's a Mannich reaction.
- OK, but hurry up, Alberto.
- There's a step missing...
the final reduction,
you need a catalyzer...nickel...
Palladium !
Pietro, I've got it !
C15H24N2.
There it is.
There !
That's just the rough formula,
I'll explain the structure later.
Alberto,
why did they leave all this behind ?
We were better than them.
Mission accomplished.
Mission accomplished ?
We have to stop them doing it again.
We just have to take
the chromatograph away.
No chromatograph, no Sopox.
Pietro, we've beaten Sopox, we won !
We're free !
Yes...we're free.
Right, let's take the chromatograph
and go.
How ?On a sidecar?
We'll worry about that.
- Go to Giulia and the baby.
- Right...
Maybe I should stay with you...
Pietro, go !
Is there something you need
to tell me ?
Thank you !
The other thing.
You're a pain in the ass, Alberto...
...but you were right.
So!
Bastards ! Clever, but bastards !
Honey, here I am ! I made it!
I know, I know...
late as always,
but please don't be angry.
No, I won't.
Giulia...
...I'm free.
It's over. Today I'm coming home.
Metro...
...why is there a swastika
on your helmet?
Because
it's an original Third Reich helmet.
And why do you have
an original Third Reich helmet?
Because I came in
an original Third Reich sidecar,
and I could never wear
an ordinary helmet
on an original Third Reich sidecar.
I'd look like a moron !
Just don't show the baby
the swastika.
No, of course not ! Absolutely not!
I know this is a very delicate
moment, the first imprint...
So I can see him?
Of course you can. He's your son.
He's in the nursery.
I'll go, then.
We never got round to discussing
the name...
anything's fine by me...
...except Fabio... I really don't...
- Pietro Zinni ? - Yes. - You need
to come with us to the station.
Yes, for the signature...yes.
Tell Detective Coletti
I can come this evening
or better yet late tomorrow morning,
so I can get a rest...
becausel have had such a night.
Excuse me, I need to see my son.
- Where are you going?
- What is this?
How dare you ?
You're under arrest for breaking
parole and various other charges.
Can you please call Coletti
at the Drugs Squad ?
She's not there anymore.
What does that mean ?
It means she's gone. Come on, Zinni.
Detective Paola Coletti,
you find yourself before
this disciplinary commission
to answer charges of involvement
with the criminals
known as the researchers' gang.
How do you plead ?
Not guilty. I deny any involvement.
Do you know Pietro Zinni ?
No.
Do you know any other members
of the researchers' gang ?
No.
Do you know anything
about connections
between the researchers' gang
and the production of a drug
known as Sopox ?
No, but I believe
they're responsible for it.
Coletti, you will now take
three weeks' leave,
while we amend your position.
As for the gang,
they will stand trial
with the special circumstances
of recidivism
in the production
of the substance called Sopox,
after they were arrested
in the laboratory
in the Tecnopolo of Civitavecchia.
While we await the completion
of the inquiry and the trial,
the members of the gang
shall be held in different prisons.
They cannot and must not be able
to contact each other or you.
One mobile phone...
...a fake leather wallet
containing 10 euros,
in two 5-euro notes.
A bookshop loyalty card...
...a top-up credit card,
last two numbers illegible...
...an...
An original Third Reich helmet.
An original Third Reich helmet...
A sheet of paper with two formulae
written on it. Perfect.
No, they're not two formulae...
It's a name and a formula.
They look like two formulae to me.
- Sign there, please.
- They look like two formulae to you,
but they're a name and formula.
You don't just make things up...
They're two formulae!
Sopox is the formula for nerve gas !
That's why he needed
the chromatograph !
This madman is producing nerve gas!
I know it's crazy,
but this madman wants to kill
everyone with nerve gas !
I need the gang.
We can say we'll make a deal.
But then you'll only have
about ?2 hours...
...For six months in a tunnel
with a diameter of 1.5 meters
to take broadband into the prison...
We escape from there.
So we'll escape by internet...
There's enough explosive in here
to blow up the whole wing...
Now we can begin !
