Hello.
I said Hello.
Why you just hang on?
Because no one said anything.
- I did it. What is your problem?
Kevin said you tonight is,
what is it?
Emily, I think they're afraid someone
want to make.
We have nothing else to do?
The boys know of organizing.
Come on, so much can
it be?
Sorry! Okay I see you later tonight.
- Cool, but are not they!
Saved by the bell.
Your candy or your life!
Hi, Cindy.
You look beautiful tonight.
- I'm not Cindy, I am a monkey.
Okay little monkey, you want candy or
a banana?
Candy!
How is it that you do not
bear costume?
I'm too old for a suit.
But why does he?
See you later, Jessie.
Bye.
Hey, I agree.
I agree.
Damn Kevin!
I'd be able to murder you,
jagged with this thing.
Oh yes, you could do with my skin
damage.
If this is not on my shirt.
You wash it so again.
May I now stand up?
At first you apologize.
- Sorry? For what?
Everyone deserves to be afraid
be made.
Who do you think you are?
A ghost?
Boo! Jessie.
Dutch Come on, let's go.
Come inside.
Nice.
Gotcha.
If you klooit dynamite,
you'll burn.
Another good day.
Happy Halloween Lois.
Baines, sign ...
Baines here. - We have a problem
Boucanon and Cortez, in the asylum?
No, I'm going home.
- Roger.
Oh yes .. Mark Allen's son?
He is looking for you.
He says it's important.
- Tell him I will meet him tomorrow.
He wants to talk tonight ...
and asked when you finally
buy a mobile phone.
All right, tell him that
He knows where I am found.
This they will in their
pants do.
Where are Freddy and Kevin?
- On the patio. -What do they do?
Making love.
You know, Freddy ...
By the time you're 60, she
already slept with everyone ..
.. Except you.
So what? She keeps it best for later.
- Yeah, right.
Come on, Jessie, we're just friends.
You know, I have a friend.
His name is Kevin and
my boyfriend.
You're jealous,
He has a car and I do not.
Is everything settled? I will have him
call to see how far he has.
Yes?
- Are you ready for us?
Yes, but I'm still here doing something,
it will be worth it.
The place itself is creepy.
Remember the third floor
to regulate.
Yes, I'll go now.
Hello ... hello?
Behind-call telephone.
I lost the connection.
It reads my mind, girl.
Maybe I have old medicines.
Oh, that is.
Hey, stop!
Frightened cat.
It seems that you previously
on the third floor you, Kevin.
Would you like messing with the master?
Be prepared to pay.
Well tell, there is.
Meg is missing.
She went with a few friends ...
road and nights ago
not come home.
Where do you think she is?
- The old Santa Mirra hospital.
She and her friends were what
planning since Saturday.
Could they be anywhere else?
Arlo, I need someone who will last
to check.
She's there or not and if she is sitting
them in the difficulties.
I need help. A backup.
Someone with a badge.
They are just looking for a
reason to dismiss me.
And I have no sense.
I need to think about my retirement.
They used them your strength, together
with my father. That long-ago.
Where is Dynamite Jones
you need him?
He was a hero. He would help me
have. -He was a fictitious figure.
'Danger' was his middle name.
Look, I can speak what I want,
but a hero ...
That was 24 hours working in 7 days.
I now work from nine to five.
I think not.
I can ...
I can not.
I'll go without you.
Okay, ... okay!
I will commit a bell
to the desk ...
Let them also Gaitlin White verify here.
This is her best friend.
There is an old abandoned service tunnel
connected ...
opposite to the morgue.
It is a good place to ...
to creep without
anyone you see.
And Allan, stay away from the third
floor off!
Yes, the haunted, eh.
Hey Dutch, so there you are.
Why did you abandon me?
Crazy dog.
Come on, girl.
Spooky.
Nice furniture.
Oh Kevin, you should not
have to do.
Very cute!
Tenacious kid, like his father.
Great!
Keep your hands over your eyes.
It had better not be
and then in Mexico.
Do not look!
Okay girls, do your eyes now.
Cool.
- No, Kevin.
I am not going inside.
You know how much I hate hospitals.
I know that, but come on Jessie?
Why a fake haunted
home studies ...
while we can here and a
really investigate. It will be fun.
For you maybe.
- Come on.
Show me your Halloween a little
see sense.
And the police? The police can be
been here in months to see more.
You know the stories about
this place?
Do you remember Bart Miller yet?
Bartje Bartje!
Whether these stories are true or not, I am
not the stupid goat who goes out looking.
What is she doing?
Jessie, Jessie, are you okay?
I am ... okay.
Just a little dizzy.
Everything will be fine.
- Yes, nothing will happen.
We leave whenever you want.
I would leave now.
Why? Sometimes wait for a phone?
- What are you talking about?
Yes, you'd have to go home ...
Your mother is looking for you down al
Kevin.
What?
Fine!
- Come take a decision. It's cold!
You even flashlight
hold.
Okay, but for clarity ...
We know, we get a
great ... you know what.
Come on.
Fine, we are that stupid
children.
This kidding.
Welcome to the Santa Mirra
hospital.
Brilliant.
This is strange.
Do you smell that?
It smells like fire.
No, it's not.
That's creepy.
Good work, let me guess ...
Emmet had to work today?
- Has Emmet job?
I have all week Emmet
have not spoken.
Come on ...
Come on ... bowl.
Freddy!
Where's Freddy gone?
- Hey, Freddy?
What's going on?
Hey Freddy!
- Freddy.
I have no idea what they
about. Her mother ...
Inside, he is not.
- Forget it, okay.
I have found costumes.
- This is cute.
Shall we continue it?
You seem quite a lot of fun to have.
Of course!
There is the sound.
Must be the wind that always
a window remained close late.
Yes, if that sounds just as
as the firing of a gun.
Jessie, my God! - He is right.
It was probably nothing.
Hey Freddy, your name in here.
- Oh yeah?
That sucks.
- It was a pistol.
I know.
Gaithlin?
Wartz, can you hear me?
- Yes.
Baines here. -Honey, I thought
you going home?
Have you discovered anything?
- Gaitlin White's parents ...
were here because they have
2 days away from home had been.
No further news.
Thank you.
Over and out.
Take some rest.
- That I do plan.
Want someone to the basement?
- Sure.
I will not enter.
Schijtert scared!
How bad could it be?
The word that if we go through
the stairs!
And how is it between you
and Marie?
I like her but
more ...
my car where she likes, we
always go out and do so, but it's ...
more that I had somewhere sales
her and later pick up.
Besides I think they
someone else sees ...
You think I take chances?
- There will not answer you.
She kissed me a few months
ago, there must be something?
Oh, nice.
Freddy, it's your mother.
Your mother.
Emmet?
Pooh.
That wheelchair moving.
- Yeah, right.
You're dead.
That was cool.
It is a fishing line.
Oh, how scary.
That did not belong to.
That did not belong to,
Emmet ...
You can come out now.
I'm tired and want to go home.
Emmet.
Come on, Jessie.
Are we going home? Yes, we
need to get going.
You're such a sissy Freddy!
No, it just ...
I Sat If someone
meewil with me, come on over.
Okay, ... Jessie okay then!
You get your meaning.
But we must first Emmet
find.
See you.
I told you it was Emmet.
Go find him. I am the first
floor, where I'm safe.
I will go along with Kevin,
you do it.
Jessie Hey, wait a minute.
Go away!
Get away from me.
Meg, I am Allan.
What are you doing here?
- I was looking for you.
Stop I say! - Let me see your hand!
I need your hand.
Stop it.
Let me see.
- What are you doing?
You're not one of them.
- Give me that.
Use something?
Where is Gaithlin. I found this.
She's not here anymore, I do not know
Guess where all others are
Did they just leave?
Why are you not gone?
Remember what they said
about this place ... - Yes, shit ..
These are true!
You can not tell me that you do not
see things that you can not explain.
I do not just ghosts.
It will come.
I've always hated this place.
Are you sure ...
that your friends will not region
deliver?
You still do not understand, eh?
He will not work.
So I still come up?
The elevator brings you to it
one place!
And we are al
You could feel it can go, I
had not really found ...
The more you just have to appreciate how
more frustrated you become.
Frustrated, I would not say. I
thought it was terrible that they left me alone.
Did you see that?
Saw what?
Jessie!
Where you going?
Mom?
They are crazy!
Freddy?
Hey Jessie.
Jessie, are you okay?
I do not know.
I do not know! - Hey hey, .. quiet.
Breathe ... breathe!
What was not real?
I want to go home.
You need to find others ...
and get outta here. - No no, there
is something wrong with you, but what?
Listen.
Freddy, sometimes I see things ...
What do you do?
- Things I would like to see disappear.
Is there anything we should know?
- No.
Where are they? Maybe
We already walk home.
They can come after us so.
- No, no, in this neighborhood? No, not possible.
Hear that?
No, what?
There flute man.
Maybe it's Kevin.
I hear nothing. -I think you
nothing in that room looks.
No.
Maybe they are crazier than you
think.
Emmet.
Where I said that he would not be?
Does it matter?
- I do not know, should it?
I would do on an operating table.
What should we do then?
Come on ...
Your wish comes true. A lonely
dismal place ...
and any time someone can
come and catch us.
You're such a bitch as you
Poor Freddy managed to deceive.
But he makes it all
too easy for me.
Do you feel guilty?
- Well ...
I am more concerned about
Jessie is with me ...
would do if she would come back.
She has so far yet.
That makes it even more exciting.
Hey .. Ho .. Silver!
Halt!
What's the hell
Meg hand?
Do you believe me now?
Let us make
get away.
Do not worry Kevin, she
will not tell, okay.
I'm Marie, asshole.
Damn!
Kevin.
And where Marie was talking about when they
said you waited for a phone call ...
Your mother?
Kevin has not told you that?
No, not that your mother ...
- That she is.
Why not talk about Marie?
Yes, but I will not talk about it.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
It's so hard to explain.
It sounds so crazy. Try-it.
I had a code with my mother.
If they had to work late ...
she let the phone ring 2
and then she hung up ...
so I knew it was her and then
The idea was that I was not alone at home.
Okay.
After her death, I received every year
same phone call on Halloween, except
... when I picked up I knew it
was on the other side.
Even though I really fear death ...
I always hope that she and
says "Happy Halloween".
It sounds really not stupid.
It does not make you madder than ...
you 20 minutes ago.
You will thank Freddy, I think.
I told you that
haunted here.
Do not force me to save you!
You're not Emmet.
What are you?
Part of your friend and
a part of me ...
But I still hefty.
- Fuck!
Freddy!
Get away from him. Now!
Emmet.
Do not be afraid. I'm
a friendly spirit.
Hey, get away from her!
No, you will not shoot my friend.
Take not into your head.
You can not kill what is already dead.
It is not your friend anymore.
Do it! -No!
This happened not real?
Do you?
What happened to Emmet?
What the fuck was that?
You just shot one of my
best friends set!
Get it off me!
Please.
I'll call the police.
- What would you tell them ...?
Yes, I want a m. ..
No, hello?
No, put me on hold ...
I said move ...
Nicely done, big guy.
Look ...
There are things here, spirits ...
They have taken possession of your
friend. - You're kidding?
Okay, that's enough.
Okay wait ... wait .. wait!
Want to tell me that one of us ...
perhaps not one of us?
Yes. Who are you?
- Does it really matter ...
We can talk later.
- We gotta get away right now!
The doors are close, grating
the windows, we are stuck.
There is a way out through the basement.
Come on!
No !.... no, no, no, no!
We do not follow you. How do we know
one of you two ...
not one of them?
- Look, I know who I am ...
and I know who my sister is ...
but exactly who you are, that
I do not know.
I have enough bullets in it
all of you ...
The choice is up to you, but we
go ...
... with or without you.
You do not know where you are dealing with!
No!
You do not know who you're dealing!
Now I'll show you how a real
this guy comes out.
Do not, do not waste bullets!
- Shut up!
We do not need bullets,
when we are out here!
Damn, damn ...
Help me, Jessie!
Come not near me.
Is she one of them?
- I have no idea.
I get it unfinished.
- Is it now one of them?
Look at all that crap on her.
Go away.
- Friends, put the gun down, okay?
Put it away.
- I can not.
I will not address.
Freak you all, Kevin.
Everything is okay, stop!
Who ... are you?
Kevin, I'm Marie.
I am.
Would not even think of. Stop! There is nothing
wrong with her. You panic!
Put the gun down, okay.
- Please turn the gun down ...
Put away. Marie-You 're not!
- That stuff is on me ...
Please, take it away.
Marie.
Oh no.
Paranodde bastard, you have her
just killed. -She was one of them.
-What? Give me the gun!
- You, too? Are you one of them?!
Fuck you, wave man!
No more bullets, you idiot.
She was one of them ...
- What have you done?
She was one of them ...
She was flesh and blood!
- I protected everyone!
You protected yourself.
- Look, we have to start now gone.
You'll have to trust me.
We call someone when we are gone.
- No, she goes with us.
How much?
That all the balls you are carrying?
- They come from fathers casket.
I do not think he thought,
I 'm really would use.
Come on, forget the stairs.
We take the elevator.
No wait, come from there. Which is
only to the third floor!
What are you doing? -I try to us
the basement to get.
Why then press 3?
- I have not printed on 3!
Get us out of here please.
- I 'm trying, Jessie.
How do we know?
How can we be so sure that you do not
fall apart like Emmet?
How do we know?
Because I bleed.
They just seem to people.
Where's Marie?
I'm OK! I'm okay.
Yes, you're okay,
Like the rest of us!
Whatever.
We're stuck.
- No, it's worse!
We are stuck on the third
floor.
They are.
- I hope so.
Well, we lost them.
- They sit on third floor.
Eliot! ... What?
You're kidding!
Meg, you must tell me exactly
what happened is between you and ...
your friends. They are here
not just left!
Apparently, all we see ...
It happens constantly here, just ...
nobody leaves here alive to
after to tell.
Have you caught them?
Did they?
No!
I learned something ...
on at least a ghost ...
or whatever it may be.
They let you think your friends
not who you think they are.
If you die, they take you
body over.
Only I do not understand why.
It seems like something is burnt.
All doors are locked,
blocked or closed.
I wish we were gone.
If they know what you did,
they send you to prison anyway.
My boyfriend goes to jail!
It was self defense, Jessie.
- I'm not so sure. -Stop it!
Marie is gone.
Have you noticed?
Yes, I know.
What happens?
What is she doing now?
I'm tired of this crap.
I want them here them stop.
- Stop her!
This is our chance Come on.
Come on, we must help others.
Which may themselves be saved.
- I can not leave!
Do you think they will listen?
We must save ourselves.
That one is a totally crazy and the others
save it as we do not help.
You came here for me or not?
You found me. Let's go.
You're Dad.
You're not a policeman.
We call the police
when we are gone.
I can not.
Your candy or your life!
Allan!
What is going on here? That is a long-
story. I thought you could not help?
I am your father due to
you to watch. Put that thing down.
You have your time taken.
I walk all night rounds through this
building, so I do not want to hear.
Kornwal?
Meg!
Hello. - I'm so glad you
are unharmed.
You shot with your pistol before
this evening?
Something, yes.
Does that have anything to do with those children
which I saw earlier tonight?
Where are they?
On the third floor?
I fear it!
You know I 5 Dynamite Jones' films
I created ....
and I did 10 times more heroic
things ...
Do you believe that?
You know what ...
This is a good night to make
to start.
Freddy, give me your flashlight.
Come on.
Believe me, that does not work on that door.
- I have done this before.
We do not shoot at them.
- Let's take the elevator. -Does not make sense.
I can manage it.
- They want us do not have.
Come to the fourth floor.
Locked.
I told you!
Maybe you should more often
listen to your sister.
You know the history of this
place. What happened to the third floor?
The third floor was called J-War.
That's where they fools
locked.
After a fire, long ago ...
they wanted to renovate, but when they
worked on the third floor ...
strange things happened.
They had to refresh the entire floor
all accidents to hide ...
They tried to reopen, but against
that time the damage has already occurred.
Some buildings have no
thirteenth floor ...
This place was no third
should have.
What the hell happened here?
Let's go. I would
no longer.
That is what is left of them ...
they came for me!
- Who?
My friends.
I have stopped them ...
We want to go!
So I escaped.
- What is it?
A wasluik. - Passing by we?
- Why not, Dynamite?
It is so bad, I go first.
- Sure you're going first.
Meg!
I thought we were friends?
Damn, what's that!
- Oh my god!
It Gaithlin.
- Meg?!
Go! .. Go, go!
fast!
Meg!
Jessie?
This is getting better and better.
No, no.
It's time for your bath, Carmichel.
No, no.
Jacob, time for your medication.
It is time, Sister Russel ...
... time to be released.
Jacob, even if you end up
this room ...
then you continue along the
guards down.
I am prepared.
Give me the keys.
Then I do not hurt you!
- Why Jacob?
I want what everybody wants.
- Small children hurt?
Never!
If I do not come,
are you not here.
No!
Who are you?
You know who I am.
The question is ...
what I want!
What do you want?
You're different from others.
You are the key to me
free.
I choose you.
I will be sure,
you remain trapped.
I am noble.
How do you enclosed to me
love, crazy little girl?
I'm not kidding.
Why you talking to
yourself?
Are you okay?
- I think so.
Who are you?
- Someone who wants to help.
You look familiar.
- Yes, I kind of face.
Freddy, where is kevin? -I do not know.
I saw him in the hallway ...
and suddenly he was gone. Perhaps
he is smeared.
Well, you both disappeared around
same time? -Then he is still here somewhere.
Let's go, maybe he
have somewhere safe. - Whether he's gone!
That is who you are, the actor,
Action Jones, or something.
Dynamite Jones. -Yes, I can
I still remember.
'Danger' is the second name of dynamite
Jones. That was funny movies.
It was no joke.
That those matches that was
be cool.
I do not do that anymore.
Now what?
I do not walk around!
Do not be a crybaby.
I am not.
It's okay.
Hey guys.
We still have 2 floors
the stairs, right? -Yes.
How can we on the third
floor!
She does not want us to leave.
We must go back.
No way!
Shit!
Help me, help me.
How did he come in it?
How did we get here?
How I have come here?
I do not know.
It is something in here.
Oh shit! I'm sorry, sorry
really bad.
Get me out of here please.
Help me!
There is still something in here!
Jes!
Jessie, Jessie .. take me out of here.
We do what we can, okay.
Help me, Freddy.
No.
No, no, this does not happen.
I'm a fucking clap!
No, no ...
Oh no, she definitely took me right there in
that door, if I do not think.
I do not let them take over.
Let me Fri It's too late
for your friend.
Hello!
Help me!!
Let me out, for God's sake.
What are you doing?
I can not take it anymore.
Let me out of here!
What happens!
Oh my God!
The last person I saw
like you ...
that I shot in the face.
Shoot me in the face and
You are to me!
Come on, come on, let's go.
Come on!
Unbelievable!
Maybe we can go up and
try. -He let us go. - Who?
I know why this happens.
- Maybe you can inform us.
The spirit that is doing this,
Jacob.
He is the person who has the fire
Founded in hopes of escaping ...
but all patients died.
- But why does he want us to take over?
He needed one of us.
A body to go out walking.
And that girl? What did they do?
- I think they ...
wish to move away from the house
where Jacob has tucked her.
So he thinks are out
to run and that everything will be okay?
I think he thinks so,
but who knows ...
This is the sick mind of a dead
guy, not mine.
I still do not get it. So
minds have now been agendas?
Tell me now that Jacob
so concerned about a past life?
Do you think the living afraid of death
to the dead and afraid to live?
I do not know.
During my time as I bitch about
shot, then he was dead.
What did you like about the living
and fear the dead?
Yes, that was sarcastic.
- Logically, he wants out.
But he knows not what is outside
means!
Outside means life again.
If we want to come back to life outside,
he must be scared to live.
How do you do that?
I can not find his file.
Great news, guys. It looks
that we can go three meters.
That is mine, you know.
- Not anymore.
Dirty dirty bastard.
What you gonna do?
- I do not know.
It gets worse.
He wants out, I feel it.
Hello.
Hi, Jessie Ann.
Mom?
If you do what he says,
he lets you go.
Mom, I love you.
But, tell me please
what to do.
Why?
Because you're dead.
And not really.
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy.
Stupid ghosts.
Oops, really scary!
What was that?
I have provoked him.
Why does he not just get us?
He just plays with us.
Did you file
Jacob found?
What you looking for? -There was a nurse
in the patients when the fire broke out.
She sacrificed herself so that she
was sure that he could not escape.
And now my turn!
I'll just stop asking
how you come to that information?
This is impossible!
- We keep trying!
Schizophrenia and severe depression.
Hold this.
All I wanted was my
Study complete ...
out of town and go all over again
First, look at me now and again.
You can not always flee
your problems.
And why not? - Because they always
will continue to haunt.
If someone wants an end to
that scratchy sound!
Thank you!
- Are you ready?
Ready.
- Are you sure?
I have these visions too long ...
The only way to get away
come is to make use of them.
Success!
Jacob Okay, come on out.
Want to go here and leave?
Come on, let's go for it!
Do not think I do not know why
Sat here ...
You were afraid to go outside.
You were afraid of everything ...
The only way to find out
who you really were ...
and you here forever to hold.
How can it be ...
that a spirit is anxious ...
than those he frightened
trying to make?
So you want to look like?
Why do not you guy
and do you know me?
But do not kill me,
take me alive!
Would you live again? Then run
we went to outside!
It does not work ...
You will die and I take
you over.
I become alive again.
That has not worked so far.
Do you just go outside
walk with one of those bodies ...
and not re apart
will fall? - You are weak!
Always say sorry ...
while only 3 simple words
had to say to your mother.
You're pathetic!
- Error! Try me out.
I'm stronger than you think.
So if you insist ...
.. I think more than good.
Always afraid that you might as
will end up like your mother ...
who saw things they had not
must see.
But its only been
the symptoms of the disease ...
that yours is the real deal.
Who is crazy now?
You want to live? Well, this is where
it is all about.
And now Jacob!? Can you yourself
find their way.
How does that feel, Jacob?
How does it feel to live?
Jessie Hey, are you okay?
- It's over!
Why would you do something stupid!
Come on, get out the way!
Die!
I am sorry
Are you okay?
Thank you Jessie, you showed me the path.
- Go to hell!
Want to hell?
We are already in hell.
And your pain of life
much better than ...
the pain of not living.
Feel this.
When I saw you ...
Everything ...
I know you better than you know yourself.
And jessie? Your heart is darker
than you think!
You were just so caught in your own
fears as me.
