As the search for miles
west continues,
hope for finding the young
man alive is decreasing.
In these conditions, the
real dangers are exposure,
hypothermia,
and starvation.
In locals new today, Liam
west, the brother who
originally reported miles
west missing, was seen
driving with Lauren huxley,
the girlfriend of miles.
Miss huxley is the
daughter of police chief
huxley, who has said again
that there is no evidence
of foul play in
the disappearance.
I don't know why I treated
you the way I did.
I just want you to
know I love you.
Cause I don't know if
I'm gonna make it back.
Look at this, man.
Fuck yeah!
You wanna try to
get into this?
Liam! What's up, baby?
Liam!
Come on, man.
It's a party.
Liam! Liam! Liam!
Six hundred grand.
I warned him.
I said, kid, don't wrap the
line around your fingers.
Six hundred grand.
That's three hundred
grand a finger.
He was a concert pianist.
So they reattached them.
Well, apparently they
don't work so good.
Miles, can you get my...
Fuck it, you know?
We're the ones that found
their finger anyway.
If there was any
justice in the world,
-we would've gotten a slice.
-Miles, can you please get my--
alright, alright.
I'm taking a shower.
Here I go.
My underwear.
They settled the
insurance months ago.
I don't know
why he keeps...
Here.
Kinda wet.
Mom's bringing
her kids today.
I just really don't
wanna be late.
So, how much would i
get if I lost a finger?
What if I lost an arm?
Not the same thing.
You can lose all
of your limbs.
The kid's fingers
are worth more.
Remember that
dude in Utah?
In the desert?
Got stuck under that rock,
had to chop off his arm.
Dude made a killing.
From selling his
story, not insurance.
Yeah, I'd sell the story.
Right. Man chops off
arm in insurance scam.
It's a great story.
Okay, I'm sorry it
didn't work out.
Go ahead.
Get on the bus.
Who's ready to
see some fish?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Wait, wait, wait.
Nah, we're good.
We can make this happen.
We'll have her
ready in no time.
Uh, I don't think so.
I'm sorry, mom.
No, I'm sorry.
I'll call you later, okay?
It's my fault.
It's all me.
Notice of possession. Sugar
mountain coastal charters
will remain closed
until further notice.
The port authority.
No, that's a
mistake, Liam!
Hey, I'm gonna
call the bank.
I'm gonna sort this out.
No, no, what the hell!
Four months late on
your boarding fees.
Insurance is
overdue again.
What? No, Warren knows
that we always--
no, it was Warren
that called it in.
He can't carry
you kids no more.
Yeah. Well, thank
you very much.
So...
The good news is we have a month
before they try and sell her.
We'll get her back.
We, uh...
We just need
cash and fast.
You fucking knew.
Right?
That's why you've
been talking fraud.
Well, see...
I've been thinking
about this for a while.
Mom captained this thing
for twenty-one years and
we lose it in three.
Alright, man, I'm serious.
All we're missing up on
that mountain right there...
Boy, we'd have a
hell of a story.
It's stupid.
Hey, hey, whoa now.
People make money all the
time from being stupid.
I read about this girl who
hid in cupboard for years.
There's this Australian
guy, he got lost in the
himalayas, survives off a
Mars bar, sells his story
to 60 minutes.
I'm not kidding, man.
This is serious.
I can pretend to go missing
up on that mountain.
Yeah, with no survival skills
and no sense of direction.
You'd get lost and die.
But you would train me.
You'd still get
lost and die.
Okay, you'd have to do it.
He knows the
mountains too well.
No one would believe
that he got lost.
-Thank you.
-You'd have to do it.
Ooh.
Are you trying
to get rid of me?
No, who'd wanna
get rid of you?
But atleast I can
finally get some sleep.
Oh okay.
Maybe you're just trying
to get alone with Liam.
I don't know.
Liam, do you snore?
I really don't know.
I don't think
anybody knows.
Can we just go?
Hey. I was talking to
Bob mills today.
There's work going on
at the reindeer farm.
Cash in hand.
And James will be headed
back to Seattle soon so
they'll be work here.
Or I can just shoot Carol
and you can start tonight.
I got it, I got it.
Ah!
You know, you should
reconsider joining the force.
Then I'd have
to leave here.
No, you wouldn't.
You can get station here.
I can put in a good word.
I happen to know
the chief of police.
Thanks, thanks.
You know, you should talk
to miles about this, too.
Him and I are both
looking for work.
Miles?
Join the police force?
What are you kidding?
No, I don't think so.
Think about it.
I think you'd
make a good cop.
See you around.
Here's the best
part of it.
We're not hurting
or robbing anybody.
We're selling a story.
It feels wrong.
You wanna know
what's wrong?
It's the harbor screwing us for
missing a couple of payments.
Some kid making a fortune
for being an idiot.
Mom getting lung cancer.
Never even smoked.
You know?
Here he is.
There you go.
I think we shaved
off ten minutes.
It's not a race, miles.
That said...
I can do it faster.
You know, ten
days is nothing.
I was reading about this
nine-year-old autistic kid.
Survives for twelve
days down in Nevada.
I could do two weeks.
No.
I'd fight a wild animal.
-What?
-You know, like a bear.
Maybe not a
bear, you know.
But one of those grey
wolves like uh...
Sharkey saw down there
at barker's creek.
Coyote. There aren't any
wolves in this area.
See the thing is, I'd come back
with all these scratches
all over my head and sell
the story right there.
Hey. We already settled
on your story.
Yeah.
I will survive off
of moss and lyceum.
That is riveting.
Home sweet home.
Hey, I only agreed to do
this if we did it my way.
When you get back,
I'm moving out.
You're the only one
who can cook, man?
Who's gonna watch
e! News with Lauren?
Her boyfriend.
Yeah well, I don't know
for how much longer.
She's starting to
get clingy, man.
She's always talking
about kids and...
It's a shame, too,
because boy, the sex.
Okay.
I mean, we can't do it
right now because we're
involved in this whole
thing and she's involved.
But yup.
Once this is all
settled, she's gone.
Just me and you, brother.
-No.
-Come on, just take it.
Mom, I'm not
taking anymore.
Sweetie.
It's not for him,
it's for you.
I'm gonna pay you back.
I know exactly how
much I owe you.
I don't care about money.
What's this?
-Their dryer broke.
-Oh yeah?
You want your Halibut
steamed or grilled?
Your dad's on a diet now.
-Can you believe it?
-Oh my god, no.
How much did you
give her this time?
You either live here or you
live over there with him.
-Got that?
-Mhm.
I'm sorry for
using your dryer.
And when are you going
back to Seattle?
-As soon as I can.
-As soon as you can.
You been gone two semesters
already, you know?
There's no point in
getting mad at her.
Just let it go.
What?
Have you been writing
about the hoax?
Of course not.
I remember stealing your
diary when you were eleven.
I reported that
to your dad.
I wanted you arrested.
Yeah.
And he wanted to
arrest your dad.
What?
I showed him what you wrote.
Right, right.
I have an idea, but it
means I'm gonna need to
steal your diary again.
Liam, come on.
Liam!
You're kidding
about this, right?
It's not real.
I want to flip her
and thrust into her.
We need people to
think I'm jealous.
That I'd wanna kill you.
You're left for dead and
he gets falsely accused.
And explode onto her
back like a geyser.
So when you return
it's a better story.
It's two stories.
We double our money.
I love it.
But they're gonna think
you're an asshole.
I mean, you can't
use this stuff.
Come on.
This is filthy.
Okay. Can I have it back now?
When I finish reading it.
You're done reading it.
Oh.
Give me one of those.
Here, buddy, buddy, buddy.
Bon jour!
Hey, Angie.
Creamer. Yeah.
When do you go?
A few days before I start
classes so I can have a
little look see.
And park Disneyland.
Hey, Liam.
Is miles good?
No, miles is bad.
He is not.
Not to me.
He doesn't treat
me like a retard.
I'm sorry, I'm
just kidding.
So is that it?
No, I need a
hunting knife.
What are you hunting?
Miles.
It's for miles.
Oh, the moose on the
handle is the best one.
Only four hundred bucks.
Miles deserves that one.
It's only sixty.
Cool.
Should I put it
on your account?
Thanks.
We'll settle up soon.
Yeah, of course.
No hurry.
Moose on the handle's better.
He's exhausting.
I'll trade you brothers.
Depends.
Do I get miles or you?
Yes, miles, I got the knife.
Josh rang it through.
Great, that's
even better, man.
Oh! Number four!
You ready?
We gotta go.
We gotta do this.
-We gotta do it right now.
-I don't know, man.
-I'm not up to it.
-Come on, Liam.
-It'll be fine.
-Let's do this.
Number four.
Who's got number four?
Liam west, check your
friggin' ticket.
-Liam! Dude!
-Four!
A dozen fudge muffins
from Angie Miller.
Who is off to Paris next week
to become a cosmetologist.
Does it have
to be tonight?
Yeah.
-Let's just do it.
-Here you go.
The winner is...
Ah! Number four!
Eddie!
Hey, hey! Okay.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
Come on, man.
No more cheating, alright?
No, who's cheating.
I don't see
anybody cheating.
Jesus, miles.
I don't wanna do this.
Brother, we had
a deal, okay?
Now we gotta
make this thing.
Come on, let's
go right now.
It's alright.
Oh, I thought
you were still...
Paroled. How about that?
Nice, man.
Sup, little runt?
You good?
-Yeah, I think so.
-Yeah, you look good.
How about I buy a round?
Lend me 50.
Hey, brother. Let's go grab
a smoke real quick, alright?
Let's do that.
Hey, it's good to see you.
How you doing?
We'll be back in
a couple minutes.
Yummy.
I mean, look at this,
look at this.
Look at all these people.
Come on.
And the winner is...
Number three.
How much do you owe me?
Well, that's what I was
gonna tell you about.
See, Liam's kinda got me held
down and I can't really...
Hey. Hey. Hey!
Look, in two weeks.
It'll be over.
You'll get the boat back.
All my life, he's got me doing
things that I didn't wanna do.
I know, but you
can't pull out now.
He doesn't need
me anymore.
But I do.
I can't do it without you.
Hey, what the
fuck you doing?
Nothing.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Come here.
I saw you with your
hands all over her.
Not now.
Come here, boy.
You know it is true.
You do look at her all the
fucking time, don't you?
-That's bullshit.
-Yeah, nothing happened.
I'm talking to you.
Come on, guys.
Knock it off.
It's true.
Now you tell her.
Hey, that's enough.
Break it up.
You shit. You tell
the fucking truth.
Okay, you selfish prick.
Man, you'll use anyone
to get what you want.
And you don't
fucking deserve her.
Damn!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let him go!
When you get to the frozen river
what direction are you heading?
North.
I flipped you up on that
pool table like it was the
end of a hot date
last night, didn't I?
You alright?
Yeah.
You know it didn't
mean anything, right?
Miles.
Alright, I'll
catch you around.
Excuse me.
I'm kidding.
-I'm kidding.
-Don't do that.
Come here, come here.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
Okay.
We need to split up.
Okay.
Oh! Whoa!
Yeah! Yeah, boy.
That was a good one.
That's a good one.
Give me those.
I know you're
doing this for me.
I love you for it.
Ah!
I'm sorry, man.
Here we go.
Man, I'm sorry.
Really, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make this
up to you, alright?
I promise you that.
Okay?
What happened?
Sit down.
You're all bleeding.
Sit down.
Get him some water.
Okay.
It's miles.
Miles?
Fuck, fuck.
Miles!
All volunteers must first
sign in in the red cross tent.
You went through the
forest right here?
We were hiking up the
south side of the peak.
He's so competitive.
Did you try
his cell phone?
He left it charging
in the truck.
You had a fight
the night before.
I thought a hike might
help clear the air.
Because you came
onto Lauren?
I wasn't.
Then why was he so pissed?
I mean, did something happen?
No.
So you're not
interested in her?
No.
Why don't you
have a girlfriend?
I mean, I hear Angie Miller
would like to take you out.
What?
Can we just go find him?
Alright.
Is he stressed
or agitated?
No, he was good.
Did he say anything
about Joe bright?
They're old friends.
Maybe he gave miles a
reason to disappear.
No, it's got nothing
to do with Joe bright.
He's just... he's lost.
Mhm.
And uh, how long did
you look for him?
Hours.
And then I went back
to truck and waited.
And that's when you
went and told Angie.
Yes.
Alright, that's
it for now.
You can go look
for your brother.
Liam.
Keep your cell phone on.
We only just got here.
We got real good
fluff yesterday.
Well, if you see
or hear anything...
Yes, sir.
I heard something.
-When?
-Yesterday.
And this was on the north
side of the mountain?
Yeah, first we thought it was
an animal. It kept going...
And then there was a groan
like it tripped or something.
My brother heard it, too.
Yeah, we went looking, but
we didn't find anything.
What time was
this at, boys?
After lunch, about two.
No, miles was still
with me at two.
Okay.
Good job, troops.
Remember stay alert.
Report anything
you see or hear.
Let's get back out there.
With miles west missing
for over 18 hours, a large
media contingent has begun
pouring into base camp.
Sugar mountain police say
rescue is crucial within
the next 48 hours in
these cold conditions.
Put your arms around me.
They're filming.
How was it out there?
Some scouts claim
they saw miles.
No.
It's alright now.
Hopefully they find
the beanie soon.
And Josh turned in
the knife, right?
I felt so bad
lying to your dad.
Don't feel bad.
He's the biggest
liar I know.
He cheated on mom.
She doesn't know.
What?
I overheard him one
time on the phone.
Told me the night
of your 21st.
That's why you
got so drunk.
I always thought it
was something I said.
I even tried to run away.
Got as far as Anchorage.
Yeah, where
were you headed?
San Francisco.
I would've gone with you.
The media and volunteers
are pouring in as day
three of the search
for miles begins.
But Peter, rumors are
spreading about a fight
the night before Mr.
west disappeared.
What do you make of that?
Look, I can see why...
Jim.
Put the knife away.
But I'm all prepared.
I'm all prepared.
Moose handler handle?
It's what you should've
bought him and not that
other crappy knife.
What are you
talking about?
Nothing. Josh--
he bought miles a
crappy knife.
Wait, when?
-And then he lost him.
-Jim.
Miles never
mentioned it to me.
Because I never
gave it to him.
You didn't give
him the knife?
There's bears out there.
-I gotta go find him.
-No.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I already told you.
You're not going
anywhere, alright?
Get him out of here.
Come on, Josh.
You heard him.
So uh...
What did you do
with the knife?
I, uh... I lost it.
Miles!
Miles!
We got something.
Why'd you lie?
I don't know.
How did it start?
I don't remember.
Who threw the first punch?
He did.
And you don't
remember why?
I was dazed.
When I came around,
he was gone.
Did you hit him back?
Maybe.
You'll have to do a
lot better than that.
Jesus.
You know, I got
the worst of it.
You're here.
I'd say he got the worst.
Don't worry.
He'll think it's you.
So you don't think i
could've said more.
No, you did well.
Like a deer in headlights.
Yeah, well that
wasn't acting.
Have you seen my go-pro?
Is this okay for
an interview?
Yeah, it looks nice.
-Cool.
-I like it.
Oh, but fucking...
Poor Josh, right?
Oh my god.
I know.
Can you imagine the headline
if they hadn't stopped him?
Handicap kid survives
in wilderness.
It would've fucked us up.
Yeah, well imagine handicap
kid dies in the wilderness.
That would've
fucked us up more.
He's okay though.
Uh, he's pretty upset.
Yeah, but when miles gets
back, it's gonna be the
best day of his life.
It will.
The whole town
will have a party.
See, that's the thing.
What we're doing, it's actually
bringing people together.
Exactly.
Seeing them all
go out like that.
Plus with all the
attention we're getting,
it's gonna bring
more tourists.
Yeah, I know.
This could be the best
thing that ever happened
to sugar mountain.
What about this one?
I think the other one brings
out your eyes a little more.
Oh.
Hey, thanks, really.
Come on, it's nothing.
How's Josh?
Grounded.
So...
You must be all packed
up and everything.
I canceled.
Angie, no. Why?
Well, because...
Well, mom and I are taking
turns guarding Josh.
Anyway, I wanted to
be here for you both.
Thanks.
Yeah.
So...
Do you wanna
eat some chili?
I'm so stupid.
I'm so stupid.
Why did I do that?
Angie.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Please don't cancel.
You've been planning
this trip for ages.
Okay, I'm just gonna
admit something.
I've always liked you.
Yeah, I've always
liked you, too.
-And that's why...
-Really?
-Don't worry.
-No, Angie.
Hey, uh, I don't know.
I don't wanna...
-Yeah?
-Okay.
-Wow.
-Yeah.
Oh god.
No, don't worry,
don't worry.
Oh shit.
Oh my god, my
foot is caught.
My foot is caught.
Okay, okay.
Here.
Well he seems to be taking his
brother's disappearance well.
What?
It's not what
it looks like.
I just wanna go over a
couple more details, okay?
Tell me about your debts.
What we owe for mooring.
That's it.
When that kid lost
his finger, we had to
resurface the decks
to get reinsured.
What about the loans that
miles took out using the
boat as collateral?
What loans?
You mean, you don't know
about his gambling?
What are you
talking about?
I'm talking about the
numerous trips he took
to bc to hit the casinos?
I mean, you must
have known...
You would have.
Okay.
So they didn't tell you.
Well I think
he's a runaway.
He wouldn't do that.
Man loses his business, he owes
me, and suddenly he disappears.
You never liked him.
You'd be happy
if he was dead.
I'd be happy if you'd open
up your goddamn eyes.
You should be looking
for him. He's lost.
I certainly hope
so, sweetheart.
Because I'd hate to think
that all those people out
there, risking their
lives, while he's in some
cheap motel ordering
room service.
Get out.
Loyalty is admirable,
but he screwed you.
You don't owe him
a god damn thing.
You think about that.
Goodnight.
How much does he owe?
He's gonna pay
everyone back.
So that's what
this was all about?
Him covering his debt?
What does it even matter?
We'd still be in this mess.
What does it matter?
I trusted you.
Liam.
What are you looking for?
My go-pro.
Miles took it.
I thought it would
be a good idea.
For what? Shoot footage that'll
prove the whole thing was fake?
Of course not.
Mom?
Mom?
Mom!
What happened?
She lost her footing.
She took a big fall.
She'll be okay.
Clear all vehicles.
It's okay.
How is she?
Broken collarbone,
concussion.
Thank you.
What's going on out there?
Well, I suspended
the search.
I'm so sorry, Liam.
What for?
It's all my fault.
No, no, that's
not why I did it.
But I promised Annie I'd
look after the boys.
But we had two
other falls.
I wanted them to
keep searching.
He doesn't care
what I want.
It's selfish, huh?
-Honey.
-Liam.
Sweetheart, listen to me.
The doctor said
you need to rest.
Dad's right.
Liam.
Sweetheart, look at me.
Give me a sip
of your flask.
What flask?
-I don't have a flask.
-Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.
I don't have one.
Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey.
We're gonna keep looking.
Dad said no volunteers.
He can't stop us.
We got about twenty
guys already.
Yeah, but after what happened
i don't think it's--
look, if we don't find him
soon, he's a goner, man.
Yeah. The reporters are still
talking about that maniac.
And the knife.
Everybody knows you
couldn't hurt a fly.
Okay, look. Bottom line
we find the schmuck
and we end this thing.
Once and for all.
Are you coming or what?
I'll be there.
Alright.
How do we stop them?
I have an idea.
Come on.
What's happened?
Chief huxley
needs to see you.
Okay.
Well I better
go tell Lauren.
Lauren's not here.
December 4, can't get
her out of my head.
Wanna strip her naked, tie
her up with sailing chord,
-and suck her sweet...
-Nipples.
-Make her so wet and--
-yeah, yeah, yeah.
Brad, um, don't you have some
paperwork to do or something.
I could've been
talking about anyone.
Tomorrow I'll sort
out the problem.
How are you planning on
sorting out the problem?
I was gonna move out.
Well where does
it say that?
It doesn't, but that doesn't
mean that I would hurt miles.
I mean, I wrote all that
stuff about my dad.
He moved to Oregon
with his girlfriend.
Son...
I told you.
We had a fight,
he got lost.
Unfortunately i
don't believe you.
You're under arrest.
And just so you know,
sharkey and his crew
won't be going out tomorrow.
And that's all on you.
Come on.
Stand right there.
Empty your pockets.
Trespassing at
the dry docks.
That was two weeks ago.
Belt.
We've been busy.
Keys.
What about your daughter?
Are you gonna book her
for stealing my diary?
This way.
We'll hold you here
til Monday and then
the judge will set bail.
Lauren?
Today's paper.
This has been a
difficult time.
While I still hold out
hope that miles will be
found, it's been eight days
now and I'm preparing for the
worst which is the possibility
that I've lost two...
That I've lost two people
that meant the world to me.
Did you know about the diary?
No.
Are you and Liam west
having an affair?
No comment.
Do you think that Liam
west killed his brother?
Look she said no comment.
Do you think that
miles is still alive?
Of course he is.
More.
Two more please.
Ross down the corner.
Back of the line lorenz.
Okay, Joe bright.
Just...
Thank you.
Keep to yourself now.
-You do that.
-Thank you.
I'll take top bunk.
If miles didn't owe me three
grand, I'd break your neck...
What?
You killed my man,
motherfucker.
How am I gonna
collect, huh?
When they find him...
He's no good to me in a
body bag, motherfucker.
You killed him.
You gonna pay.
I don't have any money.
You don't have no money?
You don't have no money?
You got money.
You've got some money.
You've got money.
Hey, I got money
for you, Joe bright.
I'm gonna get it for you.
I'm sorry I'm
being an asshole.
That's good, Liam.
That's real good.
Yes, you are an asshole.
Yeah, you going to be
pissing blood from that one.
Stand up.
And you're gonna
shit blood.
It's a bitch when there
ain't no money, isn't it?
It's a bitch when
you lose your job.
My mom was trying
to help you.
It's not her fault you got
caught selling blow to
tourists on her boat.
Bradley!
Help!
Help!
Joe, Joe, Joe!
I don't care.
I'll get your money.
I'll pay you more.
You gonna pay
me more, huh?
-Of course! Listen!
-What?
He's coming back.
We're gonna be rich.
-You're gonna be rich?
-It's a hoax.
Pardon me.
It's a hoax.
Hey!
What's going on?
Missed an exciting game.
We got money on it.
We don't have money on it.
Lights out, gentlemen.
When's he due back?
Sunday.
Yeah.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Liam.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
Being on the boat with you
and your mom, those were
good times for me.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Well, Jim says you can go.
Lay off the booze.
Next time you will
be charged.
I'll see you in church.
Excuse me.
And so today, miles needs your
prayers now more than ever.
Hope is not lost.
We must all be there
for each other.
Let us pray.
Amen.
Now go in peace to love
and serve the lord.
Sorry.
We need to talk.
As the search for miles
west continues well into
this eleventh day, hope
for finding the young man
alive is decreasing.
In these conditions, the
real dangers are exposure,
hypothermia,
and starvation.
Not to mention, the
threat of wildlife.
Come in.
Miles is in trouble.
Well, yeah, it's
been ten days.
No, look at him.
He's acting weird.
What are we gonna do?
Let him go.
Let him go?
I got a hunch.
You get right back out there,
I'll take care of him.
You're free to go.
I think you should
just drop me off.
I'm not dropping you off.
You're not going.
What if somebody needs to wait
with him while you go get help?
I'm going.
Come on.
The cave is around
two miles away.
Delta nine, delta one.
Delta nine, go ahead.
I followed them
to the north side.
Get the dogs and the
searches onto the north side,
do you copy?
North side?
Are you sure, north side?
Yes, the north side.
Do you copy?
Copy that.
You tired?
-Liam.
-Lauren.
Liam.
Okay.
Just back up slowly.
Alright, alright.
Okay, come on.
Delta one, delta nine.
Delta one.
I think the tracker dogs
have picked up miles' scent.
Good, ignore
Liam and Lauren.
Find miles.
Roger that, chief.
Yeah.
Okay, we're not far now.
Miles!
Miles!
Miles?
Fuck.
Oh god. He's not here.
He never even
made it here.
Fuck!
He's gone.
What happened to the frame?
Joe bright came looking for
miles and I had to pay him off.
He took your
mom's jewelry.
I'm going.
Where?
I'll call you in
a couple of days.
No, we need to work out
what we're gonna say.
You don't say anything.
If they catch me, I'll
leave you out of it.
Please don't go.
I knew we shouldn't
have done it, Lauren.
I know. You did it
because you loved him.
I did it because
i loved you.
-Give me the keys.
-Get out of my way.
Just give me
the keys, Liam.
Just give me the keys.
Sorry.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-What?
-No, I can't.
What are you doing to me?
Liam?
Yeah.
Oh.
We found him.
What, what? Is he?
Yeah, he's alive.
Put some clothes on.
Let's go.
What the hell?
What the fuck is this?
Dad, I uh...
Fuck.
Fuck!
Put some clothes
on, the both of you!
Morning, champ.
Just so you know, you can
drop all the bullshit.
I know it was a hoax.
I was lost.
I was lost.
Lost.
Mhm, yeah, yeah.
I already got that.
Why'd you keep going up?
I mean, if you just kept
walking down, you would
have found a trail
and some signs.
I was angry.
I was...
Okay.
When you're ready to chat,
just give me a call.
He has a torn bicep.
Dehydrated, hypothermic.
Can I see his
medical records?
Of course.
He almost died.
What more do you need?
Are you here to
see your boyfriend?
Yeah, are you
gonna stop me?
No, no, go right ahead.
Honey, wait up.
Look uh, I need to...
What?
We're gonna need to talk.
You and I.
Okay.
I fell.
I lost my map.
I had to find some shelter.
I tried to go up, I tried
to go down and...
I was lost.
Babe, do you
need anything?
He needs to rest now.
Of course.
Fuck.
Hey, Liam.
Look how fast I scale
this bad boy now.
Let's see how this works.
Okay.
Okay.
Where's the sun?
The damn sun never
gets high enough here.
Is that it?
Or is that it?
Seems like a good shelter.
It's nothing.
I can't climb.
I almost feel bad for him.
I haven't eaten
in two days.
Ah, fuck.
Campfire cooking
with miles.
Definitely prefer chicken.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
So what I'm thinking right
now is that I'll come up
over this little
hill right here.
This will take me to the
side of the mountain.
But I don't know.
You've seen how
my luck's been.
And there's white snow.
That sun is gonna set.
It reminds me of you.
When we first
met on the boat.
Remember that?
I really fucked it up, Liam.
I don't know why I ever
treated you the way I did.
I just want you to
know I love you.
Because I don't know if
I'm gonna make it back.
Tracy?
Honey, is that you?
It's me, dad.
What, is it mom?
No, no, she's fine.
Okay. So...
Please, have a seat.
-I'm good.
-Just sit down.
-I don't need to.
-Just sit down.
Just tell me.
Liam.
What did she say?
Thanks.
So we've been
getting offers...
I think we should start
thinking about a price.
Yeah, listen...
I'm so sorry.
But I can't do it.
What did you say?
I can't do it.
I promised.
What are you talking about?
Mom, she appeared to me.
That last day.
I'd given up.
I had given up
at that point.
She appeared to me, she
showed me the way out.
You sure it was mom?
Yup.
She addressed me as idiot.
And I swore to her,
i said, mom...
I'm gonna promise that I'm
gonna make you proud for
the rest of my life.
No way did she
appear to you.
You weren't there
when she was dying.
You were too gutless.
I was the one.
I was the one who went to
the hospital every day.
Where were you?
You see, miles,
i loved her.
I watched the light
go out of her eyes.
She appeared to you?
She appeared to you?
If she was gonna appear to
anyone, she would appear to me.
Okay, that's enough.
You have to go now.
What's enough?
This is my brother.
-I'm talking to my brother.
-Liam.
If you don't leave right now,
I'll have to call security.
You're gonna
call security.
Why don't you
leave us alone?
We'll leave, we'll leave.
We're really sorry.
-Oh, we're leaving. We have to--
-yeah, we're gonna leave.
It's fine.
Alright.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm alright.
I'm just uh...
He didn't mean that.
It's just...
Four old messages.
Please get him to call...
Tuesday, 10:10 am.
Damn.
I think we're on the
verge of a bidding war.
And when it's all over, we might
be able to get away for a bit.
What do you think?
Let's see what
miles thinks.
-Here.
-Thanks.
Liam west, prick.
I hope you die.
How you doing, champ?
Ah, chief huxley.
You wanted to talk to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Grab a seat right there.
Look...
I know you don't like
the way I do things.
-But I've changed.
-Oh.
And when I ask
Lauren to marry me...
Yeah, it would mean a lot to
me if I had your blessing.
Okay.
Oh, you boys are funny.
Yeah, it's very sweet.
And here I was thinking
you were gonna come clean.
Why are you so convinced?
What, that you're lying?
You're an aces fan,
aren't you? Alaska aces?
Yeah, yeah.
Well the Alaska aces
played the las Vegas
wranglers and you asked
Liam to record it eight
days before they played which
could only mean one thing.
You planned on being away.
You haven't
changed one bit.
Oh, and as for my
blessing, I'd be more
concerned about
hers, champ.
Yeah, but he's
had better offers.
$200,000.
More than that.
We'd be prepared to go as high
as 300,000 for exclusive rights.
Yeah, yeah.
Great, I'll tell him. Thanks.
Oh, and one more thing.
You know, I went through
quite the ordeal, too.
That's not the angle
we're going for.
No, no, I just thought...
So do you think you could
get miles to call us?
Lauren.
Thank you.
They said you needed
a few more days.
Ah...
I'd wanna surprise you.
-Hey.
-Hey.
This is some good chili.
Did you learn
some new recipes?
Took you long enough
to light that fire.
Anyway, it's awesome.
Yeah, and really moving.
Yeah, when you
fell, Jesus.
No one would ever believe that,
but you have it all on video.
You can name your price.
Yeah.
I think I'm gonna
go lay down.
You coming?
It's a bit early.
Dolan.
Those scouts
you spoke to...
Ak troop 36. Anchorage.
Yeah.
Give me the address
of the two boys.
The ones that heard miles.
We don't know it
was miles, sir.
It could put him on the
wrong side of the mountain
the day he vanished.
Prove it was all a lie.
But they didn't
actually see him.
Just get the address.
He's not budging.
So what do we do now?
Did you sleep together?
Did you?
You fucking bastards.
I'm sorry.
Ten days alone with him.
Is that was this
was all about?
You think I planned it?
You planned
everything else.
If you would've said no,
i would've never gone.
What are you talking about?
I did say no.
You tricked me.
Did I?
No, but she did.
You see, this whole
thing, it's all her idea.
Yeah, only after I gave
you every cent I had.
Only after you started
talking about robbing 7/11's.
Morning.
Afternoon.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too.
It was a scam.
-We all lost our bearings.
-Yeah.
You know, I've been
a real shit to you.
I know it.
-No.
-No, I have.
I'm gonna make
that up to you.
You and Lauren.
Then sell the story.
No lies.
No more lies.
You, you... it's a miracle.
Liam.
Just one interview.
I'm gonna make it right.
I can't do it like that.
You know it's almost funny
to go through all of this
and end up with nothing.
I don't want you to
end up with nothing.
Look, Jimmy...
It's Billy.
Billy, right.
Billy, it's a terrible
thing to lie, you know.
Look um...
I don't have a whole
lot of time, you know.
You need to tell me
everything you know or
we're gonna have to take
a long drive in the dark
back to the police station
in sugar mountain and
you're not gonna be riding
shotgun, I can tell you that.
David told me take it,
I'll give it back.
I promise.
Huh?
Good, good.
You knew it was
David, didn't we?
Yeah, you just saved his butt.
Can you uh, can you
go get it for me?
David, you gotta
give the iPod back.
Police, open up.
Hey there.
Let's talk outside.
Yeah, let's talk outside.
I told you, Liam.
I'm not asking for much.
I'd love to help you, but
we don't have anything.
He won't sell the story.
There he is.
Hey, Joe bright.
Go back to bed.
Hey.
Hey, man, so I thought
we were all squared.
You know, Lauren was telling
me that she paid you.
Yeah, well I need a favor.
-I'll deal with it.
-Okay.
10,000 bucks.
10,000? Come on, bro. We
don't have that kinda money.
Yeah, but you can get it.
You're a big, old star now.
I said you won't.
And I said you would.
Well man, I won't.
So you sat in your
hiding hole for nothing?
Now get to it or I'll
sell my own little story.
I am disappointed in you.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'll talk to him.
Oh, you better
talk to him.
You're disappointed
with Joe bright?
He's two seconds away
from breaking your neck.
Yeah, well I thought I was
getting through to him.
Please call them, please.
Make the call.
Why?
Why did you tell him?
Because he beat
the shit out of me.
Extortion and violence.
Brother, that's
gotta stop.
Give me the cash
and it's gonna stop.
Alright, look, you know i
thought money would save
everything, too.
Right?
Yeah.
And then I stared
death in the face.
What?
I walked into the mouth of
hell, but I came out the
other side, brother.
What happened to me when I was
up there on the mountain?
Brother, that changed me.
Okay? Let me take you there.
It'll change you.
What the fuck?
I want the money.
It won't help.
That will not help you.
Your life will
still be shit.
My life's gonna be shit?
Hey, hey, hey.
-Give me the fucking money.
-Miles, just make the call.
Just say that
you'll pay him.
Give me the fucking cash.
No.
Lauren, get the phone.
Lauren, go get the phone.
Come on, man.
There's nothing you can do
to me that's worse than
what I've already
been through.
Miles.
Well, you're crazy.
Now look what happened.
Make the call.
Make the fucking call.
-Just let him go.
-Make the call, miles.
This is between us.
You let him go.
Make the fucking call.
I have it right here.
Look, I got it.
See there?
That's a good girl.
No, no, no!
What, are you trying
to fucking kill him?
Guys, he's down.
He's dead.
He had a knife to my
throat and you still
wouldn't pick
up the phone?
Because you were in danger.
I'm trying to help you out.
I paid him to come here.
This was fake?
For all you knew, he was
about to slit my throat,
but you're too so fucking
full of yourself...
This is not my fault!
-Are you stupid?
- Miles!
-Are you stupid?
-Miles!
It was my idea!
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
You are stupid!
Wait, wait!
Wait, we need to do
something with his body.
-Miles!
-Joe.
Oh, god.
Miles, don't leave.
Get in, get in.
-Oh shit.
-Shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Pull the vehicle over now!
Don't look back,
just keep going.
Oh my god, is he coming?
Keep it straight,
let's go, let's go.
We gotta go.
Just go faster. Just keep
going down this road.
He's coming up on
your side. Watch out.
Pull over!
Pull over now!
He's not gonna knock
us off the road.
Pull over now!
Dad?
Stop!
Go, go, go, go, go!
He's gone.
Shit.
Oh shit.
What happened?
What happened?
Here.
Shit.
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Changing the tire.
No, there's no time. We have
to hide his body first.
Step away
from the vehicle.
Get down on your knees. Put
your hands on your head.
Step away.
Get down on your knees.
Lauren, step aside.
Go on, honey.
What the fuck is the
matter with you, huh?
We can explain.
Yeah, yeah, you can explain
down at the station.
You boys are under arrest.
You recognize this, huh?
It's registered to you.
It was found on the north
side of the mountain.
The exact same time you
both claimed you were on
the other side.
It's hard evidence.
You know what that means?
Making false statements,
hindering an investigation.
Conspiracy to commit fraud.
God damnit!
You boys are so dumb.
Alright, on your feet.
Get in the car, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Wait a minute.
What's in the car?
Nothing.
Give me the keys.
-Give them to me.
-They're in the ignition.
Alright, stay right
where you are.
You let them go.
Can't do that, honey.
Let them go or I'll tell.
Tell them what? What are
you talking about?
Drop all of this or I swear
i will tell everyone.
That would be
really stupid.
Liam, I told you
he had an affair.
Will you let them go?
You know I can't do that.
It was with your mom.
He also told me...
That you're his son.
How long did you know?
Day after.
Everything is a lie.
You are all liars.
No more lies.
Look in the back
of the truck.
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's over!
Now look.
Look.
Stand back, stand back.
What the fuck?
Oh shit!
No, no!
Oh shit.
Oh god.
Dad!
We say he tried
to extort money.
I told dad, who came to make
an arrest to save the day.
He's a hero.
And I'm his daughter.
It completes the story.
And we sell it.
We fucking sell it.
Yeah, I mean he came around the
back inside right here.
He had both of us pinned
down over here and she
pulled the trigger.
Thank you.
You gotta go
make a statement.
Just remember, she
saved our lives.
I know.
I'll do whatever you want.
So what are you gonna do?
