"Om."
Music is Anushka's passion.
And every note in this
music rings of Deven.
And Anushka is in every
breath of Deven's.
But whenever Deven fights
with Anushka..
..he looks like an innocent
child from a broken family..
..who is still on the lookout
for a strong relation.
ln the search of a home.
But l also know that very soon,
Deven shall face rough weather..
Anushka will remain
a dream for Deven.
Because Deven's craziness
and his insecurity..
..are his biggest enemies.
None can say where their tale
will end. Not even me.
Hey, this isn't a parking lot!
No car.. no petrol.
Move it! Hey l'm talking to you.
- Music! Rehearsal!
Music! Coming! Coming!
- Move your car!
l'm fed up with your friend Deven.
He's late for the rehearsals
everyday.
l'm afraid the managing
director of our company..
..will throw him out because
of his behaviour.
Ok, then throw me out too.
Don't be silly!
Morning! Morning!
l'm here now! l'm here.
l'm here.. l'm here.
Don't you have any shame?
Yes, l do but doesn't
sustain for long.
Being a chorus singer,
you dream to be a lead singer..
..and this is the kind of
dedication that you show.
Yes, l dream that's why
l'll become a lead singer.
Just like how you write and
dream to be a writer someday.
You're a writer,
l'm a singer, now listen.
Deven!
- Coming! Write the lyrics for this.
Ladies and gentlemen, l'm Deven.
Deven Yuvvraj.
Forgive me, Beethoven sir!
They think l'm a bad boy.
They're right. l'm a bad boy!
l'm a little stubborn,
a little wayward.
A little crazy and a little useless.
ln Toto, l'm a bad boy!
This is my beloved who
thinks l know nothing.
Neither do l have a voice
nor a flair for music.
But l'll become a superstar.
Darling, learn this secret.
Now, listen to me.
"Come along, l shall take
you to the skies."
"You're my only friend."
"Come along,
l shall hold you in my arms."
"You're my only friend."
"l'm a river of music,
l flow through the blue nights."
"l keep awake in the
dreamy blue eyes."
"l'm the voice."
"Come along, l shall take
you to the skies."
"You're my only friend."
"Come along, l shall
hold you in my arms."
"You're my only friend."
"ln the night, the moon hums thus."
"Listen to it, it seems it tries
to rhyme with your music."
"l'm the fragrance of your thoughts
humming to the tune."
"Sing along with my
tune if you can."
"Come along, l shall take
you to the skies."
"You're my only friend."
"Come along, l shall
hold you in my arms."
"You're my only friend."
"l'm a river of music,
l flow through the blue nights."
"l keep awake in the
dreamy blue eyes."
"l'm the voice."
"Have you ever seen the horizon
where dusk arrives."
"lt's said that through the ocean,
a fairy passes by."
"She's the queen of the night.
She walks on melody."
"Come along, l shall take
you to the skies."
"You're my only friend."
"Come along, l shall
hold you in my arms."
"You're my only friend."
"l'm a river of music, l flow
through the blue nights."
"l keep awake in the
dreamy blue eyes."
"l'm the voice."
"l'm the voice."
Deven! Deven, now c'mon, dude.
The rehearsal is on.
Stand with the chorus.
Dad, why do you behave like a kid?
You know that l'm in love with
Dev since the past five years.
And l've hated him since the
past five and half years.
Do you know how? Just like this.
Daddy, please don't do that.
l told you that..
l won't marry him until you agree.
Even if l'm sent to the gallows,
l still won't agree.
Ok. But l won't marry anybody else.
l met an astrologer last week,
he told me that l'll commit suicide.
You'll die with joy?
- Not joy, silly girl.
Suicide! Suicide!
Dad, again like a kid..
- Ok.
Robert, pack my bags!
A monkey or a flunky
will do but not him.
How does a father put sense in to
his senseless daughter's mind?!
Daddy!
He's just like a ghost, daddy.
No one can burn him.
See, he's back. This is called
the ghost of love, daddy.
Exactly! Only a human shall
come to this house.
Not a ghost. So l don't want
that ghost in my house.
Let's go, Robert.
l told daddy whatever l felt right.
So what does that wise
old man feel is right?
He says that he'll
get me married to..
..any donkey, monkey or
flunky but not to you.
But that's what he calls me..
Monkey and flunky.
Then tell him to get us married.
And l repeat once again, l'll marry
you only when dad permits.
You know that l love him too.
- l know.
But l want to get married.
- What's the big deal!
Big deal?!
l want a family, wife
and kids. Big deal!
l've lived alone since childhood.
l'm bored of it.
And l'm getting old too. Big deal.
Jackson's left eye is twitching,
isn't it?
No. - Yes, yes.
Deven.
Hi Jackson! Please give me the
violin - Yes? You want to play?
Thank you, Jackson. Now if you wink
again, l'll make you blind.
We should try and modulate
the piece to a different..
Jackson! Hi!
- Oh hi, Anushka!
Listen, l'm sorry for what happened
last evening. Please don't mind him.
You know, your guy is really
crazy. Look at this.
A new violin. Who sent it? Deven.
And sent a letter along with it
which says, 'sorry, sorry, sorry.'
He doesn't look what he is and..
..is invisible to the eye.
But we all love him.
But l hate him!
lncorrigible! Silly bad boy!
"Come along, l shall take
you to the skies."
"You're my only friend."
"Come along, l shall
hold you in my arms."
"You're my only friend."
"l'm a river of music, l flow
through the blue nights."
"l keep awake in the
dreamy blue eyes."
"l'm the voice."
Why are you so good?
Even my dad used to say the same.
And he threw me out of the house.
What are you thinking?
About how to mend your
evil dad's ways.
He hates you!
- But l love him.
How did this monkey come here?
Sir, he says that he's your
son-in-law. He has come to meet you.
Throw him out. Throw him out.
- Okay.
The entire world is looking
for love and peace..
..but they're nowhere to be found.
Rodriguez, tell them to stop
crying, they'll attain peace.
Good morning, uncles.
Good morning, aunts.
Good morning!
- Good morning, Dr. Banton!
And who are you?
- Didn't you recognize me?
l'm your son-in-law, Deven.
- Shall l call the police?
You're sending your son-in-law
to police custody?
He's a rogue of the first
order, Rodriguez.
Uncle, explain to him that
l love his daughter a lot..
..and have taken her to be my wife.
Nonsense! Get out of here,
l want peace.
You want peace? Then stop crying.
Police!
- Stop! - Police! - Stop!
You can enter my daughter's
heart but not this house.
Sorry, sir. But l've
already entered.
Sir, you're looking very
smart. Very handsome!
Thank you!
My innocent child, know the
truth and accept reality.
Each painting in this house is
worth five years of your income.
So? What's the point?
The point is, my dear boy, can
you give her such a house?
Why will l give her a house, sir?
When her house is my house
and my kids' house..
This house will be mine
after our marriage.
l always knew you were a conman.
What are you saying, sir?
Sir, know the truth
and accept reality.
Why does a man invest in property?
For the security of his family
and children. - So?
Who are your children,
sir? l and Anushka.
And please don't mind, sir. But
you don't have much time left.
How long are you going to live?
Robert!
And after your demise, these
paintings, the cars outside..
l'll throw them all out.
Anushka and our children..
..plan to live in a
very simple house.
We'll turn this place
into a music hall..
..where we'll have violins,
drums, bongos, sitars.
Robert!
You can't behave in
this manner with dad.
Why?
- Why are you so arrogant?
l've been arrogant since childhood..
..but your dad is becoming
arrogant with age.
Shut up! He's my dad!
So? What?
lf you don't understand
the meaning of 'daddy..'
..then check the dictionary.
lf the meaning of 'daddy' looks
good in a dictionary..
..then let it remain there. Daddy!
You can let your daddy
remain in a dictionary.
Not me! He's my father.
What?
- He's my father.
ls it?
- Yes.
Then go to your father.
- But.. - Go to your father!
Go! You love him, huh? Go! Go on!
Get lost! Father! Father! Get lost!
Don't fight, Deven.
- Not me, tell her.
She's ranting constantly
about her father.
One minute! You know what?
My dad is right about you.
The one who was disowned by
his father 12 years ago..
..and if the son hadn't even
dreamt of his father..
..then he isn't a son, he's
an hardcore anti-family man.
He doesn't have the right to be
a family man or a son-in-law.
Don't irritate me, get lost.
l'm going. But you'll have
to understand the meaning..
..of marriage before you marry me.
Or else, just assume that
l'm your past as well.
Anu! Anu!
Saw that? This girl will
be my past one day!
You're misunderstanding her, Deven.
Misunderstanding her?
Doesn't she know that
l don't approve of..
..the false relationships
that my family shares?
C'mon, Deven! How can a
father-child relationship be false?
lt does. lt is so in my
family and in my story.
Do you know who my father is?
My father is among the
richest men in London.
And his son is living here,
in this rented apartment.
Drives around on a rented vehicle.
Has that man ever called me up?
How are you, son? What
are you struggling for?
Are you dead or alive?
Anushka has told your story to me.
ls it? But she mustn't have
told you the complete story.
My great father married
twice. Twice!
He first married Ruchita Sharma.
She gave him a son, Gyanesh.
Half innocent, half mad.
After Ruchita's death,
my dad married my mom..
..and we two gems were
born. l and Danny.
My great daddy always chanted..
Gyanesh Yuvvraj, Gyanesh Yuvvraj.
One day, l beat up Gyanesh
out of jealousy.
Do you know what my great daddy did?
He sent me to a boarding
school that very day.
Mom had passed away.
Neither did l experience
mom's love, nor dad's.
14 years later, when l returned
back from the boarding school..
Gyanesh and l fought again.
l beat him up and my
father beat me up.
My father told me
to leave the house.
l told him what my uncle
advised me to do.
Dad! l want my share in your wealth.
Since that day, my father cast me..
..off from his mind, heart, soul..
..and also his wealth.
You know, five years ago l met..
..this friend of yours, Anushka.
l thought that at least
she would understand me.
Even she dumped me today.
l've fought this battle
for 12 years now.
And l'm still fighting.
What's there?!
What difference does it make!
Whether l have a family
or l don't have one.
lt's all good. lt's all good
lt's all good. All good.
lt's not good.
Only if l let you stay alone..
Why should we think of the
past and ruin our future?
Maybe you can live alone,
but l can't.
Today, for the first time
l saw tears in Deven's eyes.
l've seen him argue and fight
but never have l seen him cry.
But Anushka's return
dissolved his anger.
And his face lit up with a smile.
Deven! He's really
an obsessive lover!
Hello! Hello!
Hey you!
Dr. P. K. Banton
- Banton sir?!
No, no.. don't get shocked, dear.
Sit down.. calm down!
Let's talk man to man.
Darling, l've accepted my mistake.
- Good sir!
Your love has proved victorious.
l've been defeated. But l've a
small request - Of course, sir!
Just mend your ways, darling.
- l've mended it, sir.
But you mend your ways too, sir.
l'm trying! l'm trying!
l've decided to give
you one last chance.
What?
Come to my party tonight
and prove to the world..
..that you're a very decent boy.
That you come from
a good family and..
..are getting into an
even better family.
Exactly, sir! Even l feel the same.
Tonight, l've arranged for
a very sophisticated..
..theme party for my old friends.
..from South Africa,
Mr. and Mrs. Mehta.
You won't turn it into.. right?
Obviously not, sir! l want
to start fresh with you.
That's like a good boy!
That's like a good boy!
But don't mention this to Anushka.
Why? - l want to surprise
her. My daughter.
Yes, uncle.
- Uncle?!
Don't spoil it by saying
'uncle!' Say 'dad.'
Say 'dad.' Say 'dad.'
Dad.
- Dad! Sounds so nice.
But, there's another request.
That you've to maintain the
dress code of the party so..
..l'd like you to wear black
trousers, white shirt..
..and a black tie. Have
you made a note of it?
Yes, dad. - Will you buy it
or should l send it across?
l'll buy it, sir. And take the
money later. ls it ok, sir?
But what are you having, sir?
- A cup of patience!
And there he was.
Hello darling!
Why are you late? Did you sleep off?
Forget it. Forget it.
Meet them! They're my close
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Mehta.
They're the biggest diamond
merchants in South Africa. - Hello!
We're discussing the
engagement of their..
..son Daniel with Anushka.
Oh, actually it's been decided.
Do you want to see Daniel?
Let me tell you, he's
such a sweet boy.
He's a chorus singer in
Anushka's orchestra.
Those who sing in the last row.
But he's poor, jobless and orphaned.
Roams around in the by-lanes.
Wanders around like a dog.
But he's such a good-hearted
boy, l tell you.
So l told him to come to the
party and earn some money.
lsn't that a good idea?
What do you think?
Go. Robert! Show him around.
Give him a tray or something.
Go on! Do some work!
Carry on! l tell you,
it's so sad. Poor boy!
His father is a rich man in London.
But he disowned him. That's not
for you. You carry on! Go, go!
Deven, are you alright?
Try, Try! Beginner's luck always
pays. Have a go at it! Give it a go!
Yes, l want to play
- That's it, place your chips.
Yes!
- Superb!
Roams around in the by-lanes.
Wanders around like a dog.
Any one chance, maybe you
could be the lucky winner!
Eleven
- Oh no!
But he disowned him.
Careful boy, that's a lot of money!
Twelve.
Oh no! - You got a five.
l told you not to play.
First timer?
lf you don't mind, can
l give you an advice?
When small people play
such big stakes..
..they lose everything,
just like this.
By the way, l haven't seen you
here earlier. Who are you?
l'm your fiancee's husband.
You fool!
Sir, l need to talk to you.
- Officer!
Are you the guarantor?
Yes. l run the international
music and dance company here.
We work together, l know him well.
How are you doing, man?
- Slept well.
Excuse me?
- l said slept well.
Hello beautiful! What's that for?
l need you to sign here.
Thank you.
- Welcome.
We need your father's name.
Why? - l'm sorry but we
need your father's name.
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh.
- Yogendra?
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh. Not Sing,
it's Singh. Thank you.
Thank you. You can go now.
- Alright.
lf you do so again then
l'll teach you a lesson.
This is very bad. Very bad!
lt's all because of whisky.
Do you get it, ma'am?
Don't you.. - Wait! Did you
say Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh?
Yes, that's him.
Your father's dead!
- What?
lt's all here, the full story.
London multi-billionaire.
Leaves behind three sons,
Gandhi, Yuvvraj..
Can l see that?
- Sure. - l'm very sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Thank you, man. Thank
you, beautiful.
Thank you, God. Thank you, dad.
Keep it.. no, l'll take it.
No, keep it.. oh, l'll take it.
Come on, beautiful.
What dad?! When l needed
you today, you left me.
Never mind! l'll wear the crown
of the prince on my own.
What's this letter about?
Sir, it's an agreement signed by me.
lt's written that if you don't
become a billionaire..
..in forty days then l can get
Anu married to Daniel Mehta?
Of course!
Your father has expired recently
and you're smiling!
Sir, he has departed to heaven.
He has moved away from
all our problems.
He has attained peace
and we've attained joy.
What's your problem, sir?
l'll tell you what, l'll surely..
..sign on this bad dream of yours.
Here we go!
There you go!
But l've a condition, sir.
You'll not get..
..Daniel and Anushka married
for the next 40 days.
Done! Done!
lt's been four days since
your dad passed away..
..but none of the elders in your
family have informed you.
Look how cheap my brothers are.
They know that if l reach there
then they will have to give me..
..my share of the wealth.
Till now, l didn't want it.
But now, l'll surely take it.
Even if l've to murder
somebody for that..
..or give up my life
Ok listen, do not fight with your
brothers or do anything rash.
Please!
l'll play this game so coolly
that they won't even realize.
But if they act cheap,
l'll act cheaper
lf they act smart, l'll act smarter.
l've signed a contract after all.
- What contract?
What contract.. oh,
it doesn't matter.
Pack them up.
- But.. - Don't worry about me.
l'm packing them up.. stop it!
Hurry up, we'll miss the flight.
This is a car, not a flight.
How much faster can l go?
lt's a piece of junk, l'll
have to get you a new one.
And make sure you buy
that plot on that hill.
For our house. Understood?
You know how expensive
that place is.
Henceforth, every expensive
thing in the world..
Will be cheap for me.
Don't disturb. - Deven!
So, you'll not take part
in our musical show..
..which will be in Austria?
How will l? - A family drama is
going to take place in London.
l don't know what is going
to happen there.
Best of luck, Yuvvraj.
- Thank you. l need that.
Deven!
Love you. Love you. Bye!
Deven, l'm so happy. l'm so happy.
Though late, you at least came.
You know, while talking about you..
lt's stretching a bit too far.
Our dear boy has arrived
after 12 years.
Oh!
So you finally remembered
your father!
Welcome, Deven. Welcome!
Come, come.
You're a very wise boy.
You've arrived at the right time.
We refuse to acknowledge
an estranged as the crown prince.
lnteresting!
Very interesting house!
You want to know how
l was welcomed?
Sitting on a wheelchair like
a chairman, my uncle says..
Welcome, Deven. Welcome!
Which means never come! Never come!
His eldest son, Param.
The epitome of sadness.
He says.. - No chance!
That l don't have a chance?!
Scoundrel.
His second son, Dharam, with
a mouthful of food, says..
He's come to eat
Hungry! l've come to eat off my
dad's wealth, not your dad's..
Param's wife, posing
like a fairy, says..
Even he is a prince here.
Can seduce a saint!
Greetings! - She's pretty.
And talks in perfect Hindi.
Not like how you struggle
to converse in Hindi.
And who else is there?
- The rest of them are nobodies.
There are two brothers,
whom l haven't met as yet.
Hold on.
He's just like how he
was when you left.
Time passed by, but his
brain never kept pace.
Consulted many doctors,
but all in vain.
He has just one friend, Bala.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
He loves to sing. But the other
members of the family..
..take him to be crazy
and beat him up.
That's why he enjoys in his room..
..with the servants' kids.
He's afraid to meet anybody.
Wonderful..
Gyanesh!
Do you recognize him? Deven!
Your brother.
See, he has come to
meet you after ages.
He got afraid of you. Or maybe
he didn't recognize you.
Unfortunate child! God bless him!
Go.. go.. go!
Your father, Yogendra,
has left a lot of ..
..wealth behind and a
lot of worries for me.
Worries?
Uncle, henceforth all
your worries are mine.
Have you forgotten that
you're my uncle?
Son, you've noble thoughts.
- Thank you, uncle.
l wish your brother Danny had
such noble thoughts, too.
Why? Doesn't he?
- No!
See for yourself, he went
to the Hilton casino..
..even before your father's
funeral rites were done with.
That's a big no-no.
Tomorrow afternoon.
- What about it?
Tomorrow afternoon, the company
lawyer, Sikander Mirza..
..will be reading out
your dad's will.
So? - So it's necessary that all of
us, including Danny, are present.
Son, will you do me a favour?
- Yes, uncle.
Son, go to Danny and somehow
convince him to come back.
He's flying high with the
wings of his dad's wealth.
He has no idea what the
ground looks like.
"Everybody in the party.. are you
ready." - "Say EX." - "EX, EX.."
"Got to go with the flow."
"Say PLO.."
- "O."
"Ready for D."
- "Put the D to the E."
"E, E."
"Explode." -"Explode."
- "With me"
Shazia!
- Shano. - Missed me?
"Explode."
"Yes."
"l know you want me."
"Get on the floor!"
"l am looking for
that special girl."
"Get on the floor!"
"Got to get on the floor."
"Got to get on the floor."
"Get on the floor!"
"Got to get on the floor."
"Get on the floor!"
"Shano! Shano! Get on the
floor. Shano! Shano!"
"Shano! Shano! Let's start
the show. Shano! Shano!"
"Come on."
"Shano! Shano!"
"Shano! Shano!"
"Shano! Shano! Get on the
floor. Shano! Shano!"
"You! You call me closer
with your moves."
"You! You steal the moon with
the way you play with words."
"You! You dive deep into the ocean."
"You!"
"Shano! Shano! Get on the
floor. Shano! Shano!"
"On the floor!"
- "Hey!"
"On the floor!"
- "Hey!"
"On the floor!"
- "Hey!"
"On the floor!"
- "Hey!"
"Come here everyday,
when the sun bids adieu."
"When the day departs and
the shadow of night falls."
"Come here everyday,
when the sun dulls."
"When it's setting, half
drowned in the sea."
"When it's half drowned in the sea."
"Like a true hunter his
knife blazes across."
"You've used it on thousands,
this is my first chance."
"The cup! The cup! The cup of wine!"
"The cup! The cup! The cup of wine!"
"Shano! Shano! Get on the
floor. Shano! Shano!"
"Hey, Shano."
"When you touch ground,
you'll have to walk."
"The heat will burn your feet, then
you'll have to walk in the shade."
"Sprinkle the water of sense
in the eyes of intoxication."
"Don't mess with your own,
on the words of others."
"Try flying high, you'll
lose yourself."
"Life is not a gamble, those
who tried, lost miserably."
"The cup! The cup!"
- "The cup of wine!"
"The cup! The cup! The cup of wine!"
"Shano! Shano! Get on the
floor. Shano! Shano!"
"On the floor!"
- "Hey!"
"On the floor!"
- "Hey!"
What's your problem?
lf you don't recognize
your elder brother..
..it only means that you've
gone blind in love.
Yes!
You're right. Love is blind.
- Oh hi!
You're a chorus dancer, aren't you?
- Yes.
Dancing with me?
- Yes.
l'm a chorus dancer and
also his elder brother.
And l know why he has arrived
all of a sudden.
Meaning? - Meaning he hasn't
come here for dad..
..but for a share in his property.
Am l right? l think so!
Yes.
- When did l refuse? - Good.
Then you'd also be knowing that..
..l'm the 100% benefactor
of dad's wealth.
Yes, l didn't refuse that either.
But if you're done
with your romance..
..then l can tell you
what brings me here..
Uncle Sikander Mirza will be
reading dad's will tomorrow.
Will?
- Will.
l welcome you all!
My friend, my client, Lord
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh..
..made his will before his demise.
A copy of which is in
front of you all.
You can either read it here,
or read it at home.
But before you read this will,
l have two questions to ask.
My first question.
Do all of you accept my client
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh..
..to be their father
or of equal status.
What do you mean?
l mean that the manner in
which you expressed..
..your grief on TV
after his demise..
..do you really love him so much?
What is this question?
Mr. Mirza, now we respect him
more than we did earlier.
Great! Great!
My second question, what if
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh..
..hasn't given any of you
a single penny, then..
Then would you still
respect him as much?
What does money and
wealth have to do..
..with love and respect, Mr. Mirza?
lt does have a lot to do,
Mr. Om Prakash. lt does.
Money and respect share
a close bond..
..which we're unwilling to express.
Of course, l'm his son.
- ls this a question to ask?
Yes, l do.
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh's
wealth is worth..
..15,000 crores in lndian rupees.
Just so that none of you
are left in penury..
He has desired that rupees 5 crores
be granted to each of you.
Five?!
Five! Five crores per head.
You mean, to all these relatives.
Even you!
This will includes all the
relatives except one!
Who is that? - Gyanesh Kumar
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh.
And he has given all his
wealth to Gyanesh Kumar.
Gyanesh?
- Yes, your elder brother.
Now l have two more important
things to tell you.
Gyanesh's security clause.
lf for any reason, Gyanesh expires..
Whether the death is natural,
unnatural..
..or a murder or an accident..
..all the wealth shall
automatically go to a charity trust.
And the good news is that uncle ..
..will be the trustee of that
trust Mr. Om Prakash.
Time decides everything.
And one more thing, Gyanesh's
father isn't dead yet.
l'm not just his lawyer or trustee,
but also his father now.
lf any of you think
ill for Gyanesh..
..or try to break this will, then
just remember one thing..
..that Sikander Mirza
is still alive.
Thanks for your patient hearing.
Yogendra Yuvvraj Singh's..
..last wish was..
That he wanted to see his children
happy after his demise.
Nonsense, Mr. Mirza!
He wanted to see his
children happy?!
This is absolute nonsense.
l need to talk to you, uncle Mirza.
l need to talk to you right now.
Peterson, make him understand..
This is wrong, Mr. Mirza! Move.
This is an absolute fraud
and you know it.
Bala..
Gyanesh! Gyanesh! Stop it!
No!
Gyanesh!
Stop this noise! Bala!
Stop it! Stop it!
- Hey Gyanesh! Come down!
Catch!
Catch!
- One more.
What's this happening?
Come down!
Come on, everyone go into their
rooms. Come on, go inside.
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Sir.
Sir, are you alright?
l respect dad's will.
- You're lying.
And you?
l just want a share of the wealth.
Even l desire the same.
Cheers!
The entire wealth can be ours
but on one condition.
50% mine, 49% yours
and 1% for Gyanesh.
Done!
- Done.
lt's a deal. All the best!
Ok, Dev. But just
remember one thing.
We're just partners in this
deal, not brothers, ok?
l know. Just partners, not brothers.
Your father's will could
be challenged.
l knew it!
l knew that only Peter Patel's
company can turn the tables.
Saw that?
- Yes!
How's your influence
on Gyanesh Kumar?
Very strong. He's scared of me.
He shivers even if l sneeze.
He listens to all that l say.
Don't worry. He listens to me.
Good.
lf we can ask Gyanesh Kumar
to make a statement..
..that when your father made the
will, he was mentally unsound..
You know something like..
- Got it! Got it!
You know very well, Gyanesh,
that father was in the lCU..
..for three months before
he passed away.
You were with him all the time.
These lousy lawyers
are troubling me!
They say that the family lawyer,
Mr. Sikander Mirza..
..has played foul with all
the legal documents.
They're saying that he's trying
to get rid of all of us.
But why?
- Because it is so.
Yes, brother. Those lawyers
just want to meet you..
..and record a statement that
father's mental health..
..was poor during the last
three months of his life.
He used to complain about the
darkness during the day..
..and grieve about the
sunlight at night.
Sometimes he even used to say..
..that Gandhi was an
American President.
lsn't it so? Was father
unwell or not?
He used to blabber at times..
..cow, piano, Ludhiana..
But father was..
- Just say all this to the lawyers.
Look, Gyanesh. Don't you
want peace in this house?
Then will you say all this?
That's good! You're a good man.
Big boss, problem, big problem!
Problem? What now?
Anushka's dad is going to
announce the engagement..
..of Anushka with Daniel.
How do you know?
They're planning a grand party.
And they've engaged my
dance group for it.
Come back soon.
Ask him.
Well, Mr. Gyanesh..
..when your father got his will
written in the hospital..
..was he very sick?
Obviously, why else would
he be in the hospital?
Meaning.. he used to talk
about weird stuff like..
..sunlight, piano, cows, Ludhiana..
No, he used to talk about..
..Gandhi and Tagore.
He used to talk about good things.
Yes. - Are you sure that your
father wasn't insane?
You must be insane!
But Gyanesh, you told me on
Sunday that father was..
Not me, you asked
me to tell them so.
But that isn't the truth.
lt isn't the truth?!
This isn't the truth?!
You mean to say l'm lying?
Yes, you're lying!
Peter, just hang on a second.
You have to understand this, Danny.
We don't have a case without..
Right?
Shall we?
What's wrong with you, man?!
l am sorry, Danny. l can't do it..
Hey Peter! Just hang on a second.
l'm sorry.
Peter! Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a
great party of a thousand people..
..but a small party of
a few great people.
Anu, any news of Deven?
What to say, his phone
is not reachable.
This party is in honour of our
mayor, Mr. William Anderson.
And my partners and family friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Mehta
from South Africa.
Give them a big hand.
And of course their one and only..
..brilliant and handsome
son, Daniel.
Alright. Alright.
- Thank you.
Family friends because
after 30th September.
Daniel will be my son-in-law and
l'll be his father-in-law.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Cheers! Eat, drink, make merry and..
..ladies and gentlemen.
Excuse me, daddy.
- Yes, my darling.
Can l talk to you for a minute?
- Yes!
What nonsense, daddy?
This is not nonsense,
this is serious
lt can't be announced right
away that this was a joke.
l can't do that.
- Then l will.
Listen, your hero
has lost this game.
According to this document..
..l can get you married
after the 30th of April.
l don't want to read your contract.
And l can't be in this party
any longer, l'm leaving.
Then go to the stage and hit
your dad with your sandal..
..and announce..
..that your father is a cheat
and a villain. Go!
Don't blackmail me emotionally.
Am l a blackmailer?
- Yes.
Am l a fool?
- Yes.
lf you leave the party
then l'll go on stage..
..and hit myself with my own shoe.
Daddy, you're ruthless.
ls everything ok, pa?
Pa?!
Yes, yes.. tears of joy..
tears of joy. lt happens.
But l saw her crying.
She'll be leaving her
dad's home.. you know.
That lndian bride thing..
you know.. all that.
C'mon, now let's enjoy. Cheers
everybody! Let's go!
Cheers, son! - Cheers!

Don't do that!
Stop. Forget that you
were ever a Yuvvraj.
Gyanesh turned the entire case
around in front of Peter Patel.
We've lost the game!
Forget it. Just forget it.
Danny, what are you doing?
Listen.
- Yes! l've gone mad, Sazia.
l'll kill everyone and
then l'll kill myself.
Dad used to love me the most.
Only me! l'm the only rightful
heir of his property.
Danny, land please! - No!
l'll make sure Gyanesh pays for it.
- l'll fight, Sazia!
l'll fight till the day l die.
Eat, dear.
You fool! You agreed to me and
denied it in front of the others.
You betrayed me!
Danny!
- Patience, Danny.
You be patient, uncle!
This fellow is simply trying
to fool all of us..
..by pretending to be mad.
Aunt D'mello, l don't know this.
Or aunt D'mello, l don't know that.
Control yourself, Danny!
What will you do? Keep all of
my dad's wealth to yourself?
And you won't give us anything?
Tell me, Gyanesh. Tell me!
You want to bring me on the roads,
don't you, Gyanesh!
Bala!
- Answer me.
Bala!
Bala!
- Tell me!
Bala!
- l'll kill you, man!
This is my property!
Come on.
- Danny! - Bala..
This was just a hint..
For you as well as..
..well as for all those
who live in this house.
Henceforth, if anybody raises
their hand on my dear brother..
..then he'll be counted
among my enemies.
Aunt D'mello, take Gyanesh
to his room.
Well done, my son.
lt's just done now, it's
yet to be fully done.
Hello! Yes.
You cheat! You fraud!
