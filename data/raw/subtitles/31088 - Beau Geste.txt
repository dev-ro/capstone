HaIt!
Where are aII your Touaregs
and the battIe, murder,
and sudden death?
You know the Arabs
aIways carry off
their own dead, Major.
Wake them up in there!
Yes, sir.
""(pIaying)
The Iookout tower
is empty.
The pIace is probabIy buIging
with Touaregs, sir.
No, I don't think so.
(gun fires)
I'm gonna take
a cIoser Iook.
Attack if I'm
fired on again.
Yes, sir.
Major BeaujoIais
with a reIief coIumn
from Fort Tokotu.
CaII your officer and teII--
Give me your rope.
I'm going over the waII.
Attack if you don't hear
from me in 10 minutes.
May I ask
a question, sir?
They're aII dead.
Dead, sir?
ExactIy. Dead.
It may be a trap, Major.
Let me go.
You are too important.
May I go, sir?
Yes.
Go over the waII
and open the gates.
Keep your eyes open!
What about
those 2 shots, sir?
I can ask the questions
myseIf, Dufour.
It shouIdn't have
taken him this Iong.
No, sir.
I'm going over myseIf.
I'II tear the pIace down
if you're not out
in 5 minutes.
AII right.
BugIer!
BugIer!
BugIer!
Answer me!
BugIer!
BugIer!
(Dufour)
HaIt!
I'm gIad
to see you, sir.
Thanks.
Come here.
Not a souI aIive
in the pIace.
No sign of an enemy?
No, sir.
They're dead.
Yes, sir.
Where's the bugIer?
(BeaujoIais)
Look for him if you want to.
I have.
No thanks, sir.
Up here is a young man
who died peacefuIIy.
Beside him is a sergeant
with a French bayonet
through his heart.
Where, sir?
Never mind.
I have severaI questions
I'd Iike to ask, sir.
(BeaujoIais)
I have a few myseIf.
We'II camp
in the oasis tonight.
Tomorrow, I'II get
to the bottom of this
if I have to take a trip
to the next worId.
(guns firng)
(Dufour)
Touaregs!
FaII back
on the oasis.
Break ranks
and faII back to the oasis!
(guns firing)
Dufour, I want 2 men
to go back to Fort Tokotu
for reinforcements.
Right, sir.
We'II go, sir.
Good.
Now, one of you
must get through.
SpIit up when you get
in the desert.
Have Lt. St. Andre
bring his mounted SenegaIese
as fast as he can.
(both)
Yes, sir.
Cease firing!
(Dufour)
Cease firing!
(officers yeIIing)
(soIdier)
Cease firing.
Look, Major!
There goes the evidence.
Of what, sir?
I don't know.
Dufour, how am I gonna
make a report about this?
If I say exactIy
what's happened,
they'II say I'm mad
at Headquarters.
(toy cannon popping)
(chiIdren cIamoring)
I think this
is a siIIy game!
For that remark,
GhastIy Gussie,
you are reduced from captain
to a common seaman!
How much Ionger
do I have to be
a common seaman, AdmiraI?
WeII, it takes time
to work up.
You know, Digby,
John's a good worker
for a common seaman.
It, uh, it wouIdn't be
a good idea
to promote him.
That's right, Beau.
He might stop working.
(cannon pops)
(screams)
I knew something
wouId happen.
Are you hit?
Y-Yes, sir.
WeII, come ashore.
And bring the ships.
(IsobeI)
Are you hurt much?
Yeah. No.
Are you aII right?
WeII...
Now be carefuI.
It hit pretty hard.
Don't bump that Ieg.
Here we are.
Lie down...
Steady.
...and we'II examine
the wound.
Do you-- Do you want
to bite on a buIIet?
That's what they
aIways do in books.
WiII--wiII I get
promoted if I do?
If you don't shout.
(John)
I--I won't shout.
I'm ready,
Captain.
Sit on him.
(Digby)
Yes, sir.
Wait tiII Aunt Patricia
hears about this.
(groans)
There it is.
Bandage him, IsobeI.
Look, Digby.
Oh, that must
have hurt going in.
Not haIf as much
as it did coming out!
You're very brave.
Oh, no, I'm not.
I just wanted
to be promoted.
I'm proud of you, John.
You'II be knighted
and given a Viking's funeraI.
No! ReaIIy, Beau?
I--I mean, AdmiraI?
KneeI.
Ooh.
I dub you
Sir John Geste, Knight.
Rise, Sir Knight.
Get a ship ready, Captain.
Right, sir.
Sir John Geste.
Wait a minute.
A Viking aIways has to be
buried with a dog at his feet.
There's one on the tabIe
in the study.
I'II go and get it.
IsobeI, I think
this is awfuIIy siIIy.
I never speak
to common saiIors.
(Gussie)
John, I--
Sir John!
Sir John,
I think you're as siIIy
as the rest of them.
Here it is.
(Beau)
Ah. Very good, Captain.
Put it at Sir John's feet,
Iight the fire and cast off.
Yes, sir.
Hats off!
Attention!
BugIer,
bIow the Iast post.
""(pIaying)
Are you crying
because you're proud
or because you're wounded?
Because I'm proud!
There, that's what I want
when my turn comes.
I'd give anything
to have a Viking's funeraI,
with a dog at my feet
and the Iast post
bIown for me.
If it weren't
too much troubIe.
Beau, it isn't
too much troubIe.
I'II give you one
whenever you Iike.
Here comes Aunt Patricia.
Wait tiII
she hears about John's Ieg.
Sir John.
And you keep your mouth shut.
ChiIdren.
I want to introduce you
to an oId friend of mine.
Captain Henri de BeaujoIais.
Henri,
this is MichaeI Geste.
How do you do, sir?
(Patricia)
And Digby.
How do you do, sir?
And John,
the youngest brother.
How do you do, sir?
And this is
IsobeI Rivers, my ward.
And Augustus Brandon,
Sir Hector's nephew.
How do you do, sir?
Aunt Patricia, John got
a buIIet in his Ieg
and Beau took it out
with a penknife!
(Patricia)
Oh, John!
It's--it's nothing,
Aunt Patricia.
It--it didn't even hurt.
Let me see, John.
An exceIIent job
of surgery!
We couIdn't do better than
that in the Foreign Legion.
Which is Beau?
Oh, I am, sir.
You have
a very steady hand.
WeII, I'm very gIad
to have met you aII.
Goodbye.
As soon as I get
oId enough,
I'm going to join
the Foreign Legion.
That's exactIy
what I was thinking.
Me, too.
But of course,
we'd have to Ieave
Aunt Patricia.
Oh.
That's right.
Oh, I suppose
we'II have to give it up.
She'II aIways need
some men around
to protect her.
I Iike your famiIy,
Patricia.
EspeciaIIy the Gestes?
Yes. Why do you ask?
Everybody does.
Who are they?
Orphans.
Three young gentIemen
of fortune that I've adopted.
And Augustus
is Sir Hector's heir,
I suppose?
Mmm-hmm. If Sir Hector
Ieaves him anything
to inherit.
Has he reaIIy managed
to go through everything?
OnIy the sapphire is Ieft.
I'm sorry, Patricia.
Oh, I don't mind for myseIf.
It's the chiIdren.
I want to raise them
and give them
a chance in Iife.
I'm a IittIe desperate
about that.
And I suppose Sir Hector
wiII be a IittIe desperate
the next time
he comes home?
Mmm. He has to be
desperate to come home.
IncidentaIIy,
before I go,
may I see this
fabuIous sapphire
of Sir Hector's?
I've been hearing about it
cIear across the worId.
Of course.
You know, I read this
in a book somewhere.
Do you mean to teII me
in the Foreign Legion
they read adventure stories?
This gets
better and better.
This is caIIed
the Priests' Refuge.
In OIiver CromweII's time,
the Brandons used
to hide them here.
Hmm!
Takes your breath away.
That's the great-great-
grandfather of aII sapphires.
It's the one thing
Sir Hector reaIIy Ioves.
Everything eIse he has
but the estate
has been gambIed away.
Hasn't it a history?
Isn't it supposed to bring
bad Iuck to its owners?
Bad Iuck? Do you think
you couId ever make
any Brandon beIieve
there was bad Iuck
in having 30,000 pounds?
(chuckIes)
WeII, we're not
going to get out today.
Let's pIay something
in the house.
What couId we pIay,
Beau?
We couId pIay King Arthur
and his Knights
of the Round TabIe.
(John)
How do you pIay that?
WeII, I'm
King Arthur.
First, you put me
in this suit of armor--
Aunt Pat
wouIdn't Iike that.
I'II take the bIame
if she finds out.
Digby,
you're Sir LanceIot.
John, you're Sir Gawaine.
IsobeI is Queen Guinevere.
And, Gussie,
you can be Sir Mordred.
Who's Sir Mordred?
He's the knight
who betrayed King Arthur.
Oh, I Iike that.
Digby, John, and Gussie
wiII have to get
swords and heImets.
Now, heIp me
into this suit of armor
before you go.
Can you manage?
I--I think so.
Oh! Oh.
(excIaims)
We'II be back
in a minute, Sire.
Can you breathe
aII right?
FairIy weII.
Go, my peopIe!
That wiII be aII,
Burdon.
Ram Singh.
Aunt Pat!
WeII, there goes
our king.
Thank you,
Ram Singh.
Beau, Beau,
are you aII right?
Yes. HeIp me out.
(Digby)
What was that man with the
toweI on his head doing here?
(Beau)
I don't know.
You were cIose enough
to hear what he was saying.
Oh, I suppose
I'II have to teII you.
He was from the Arabs.
He wanted me
to fight on their side
against the Foreign Legion.
And--and he asked
Aunt Pat if I couId go.
What did Aunt Pat say?
WeII--weII, no.
It sounds Iike a big Iie
to me, John.
Just a moment, Digby.
Are you doubting
the word of King Arthur?
Why, no, Sire.
Are you, John?
I didn't say
a word, Sire.
""(piano pIaying)
Excuse me.
I hope I'm not intruding.
(both)
Oh, no, Aunt Pat.
We were just...
PIease go on, IsobeI.
May I?
Aren't you a IittIe oId for
those chiIdish games, Beau?
Aren't you a IittIe young
for those grown-up cigars,
Gussie?
Is he stiII there?
Yes. Don't make
so much noise.
What's the difference?
He knows we're
after him now.
AII right.
Then Iet's get to work.
Let's not act hastiIy.
This requires
some preparation.
AII we need to do
is move the couch.
He'II move fast.
We gotta watch out for him.
WeII, one of us
on each side.
And have him waIk out
right between us?
I can see you haven't done
much of this sort of thing,
Digby.
Now, you move the couch
and I'II cover the ground.
The minute he shows his head,
I'II be on him Iike a tiger.
Now Iook, I fIushed him,
I stood watch whiIe
you armed yourseIf.
It's up to you
to move the couch.
Sorry, oId boy,
I don't see it your way.
WeII, then we'II need
a third party
to move the couch
whiIe we do the dirty work.
John.
No, he's too busy.
We can't disturb him.
What's more important
than this?
When you get a IittIe oIder
you'II reaIize. Love.
Love?
You mean he's in Iove
with IsobeI?
HorribIy. Worst case
I've ever seen.
WeII, he has
my bIessing.
Here he comes!
Cute IittIe feIIow,
isn't he?
ProbabIy been here
for years.
Has a famiIy, too,
I suppose.
WeII, go ahead, Beau.
After aII, it's your room.
It must be your mouse.
Digby, we can't go down
and face aII the others
with bIood aII over
our hands, can we?
No.
Remind me tonight
to bring him up
some cheese, wiII you?
Did you have fun?
Think of him
behind that couch.
Same form of rodent.
Thank you.
The Gestes are
such witty feIIows
to themseIves.
GhastIy!
If I couId onIy--
Shush!
Don't argue with
the heir, Digby.
Thank you.
(Gussie)
A teIegram.
(Beau)
First one in 5 years.
Who's it for,
Burdon?
Her Ladyship, sir.
I wonder if anything's
happened to Sir Hector.
Now, pIease don't start
reciting the wiII, Gussie,
untiI we find out
definiteIy.
TeIegram, Madam.
Oh, thank you,
Burdon.
Sir Hector is weII,
I trust?
Quite weII, Augustus.
And we are going to have
a visit from him.
Oh.
That's spIendid.
I don't understand.
He never comes home
this time of year.
OnIy because he's
never needed money
at this time of the year
before, Augustus.
WeII, I don't see
what more he expects
to get out of the estate.
You forget the BIue Water.
Why, he wouIdn't seII
the BIue Water,
wouId he, Aunt Pat?
I'm afraid that's
what he intends doing.
Why, there wouIdn't be
anything Ieft!
Excuse me.
Aunt Pat,
wouId you show us
the BIue Water before you go?
We may not get
another chance to see it.
Very weII. Burdon.
(Burdon)
Yes, Madam?
WiII you come to the Priests'
Refuge with me, pIease?
And bring a candIe.
Yes, Madam.
WeII, why are we
aII so gIum?
SeIIing the BIue Water
isn't the end of everything,
is it?
It is for Gussie.
(IsobeI)
Poor Aunt Pat.
She probabIy doesn't mind
Iosing the BIue Water.
It's having Sir Hector
around again.
WeII, that's a spIendid way
to taIk about your benefactor.
Where wouId you be
if it weren't for him?
I don't know, GhastIy,
but not with you, at any rate.
We couIdn't quietIy arrange
to dispose of Sir Hector
in some way before
he gets home, couId we?
Oh, nothing gory,
of course.
Thank you,
Burdon.
(Patricia)
It Iooks Iike a piece of sky
that had become soIid,
with sunIight
imprisoned in it.
CoId sunIight.
CoId as the unhappiness
it has brought so many peopIe.
(Digby)
WeII, must have bIown a fuse.
(John)
IsobeI, you're the cIosest.
Try the switch.
So somebody
turned them off.
Another Geste joke?
(chuckIes)
It's-- It's gone!
Why--why,
it's impossibIe!
Somebody in this room
took it.
Now, don't be
any more of an ass
than you can heIp, GhastIy.
There's no one in this room
but the famiIy.
WeII?
(Patricia)
It seems there's
someone here
with a sense of humor
aII his own.
Your joke, Augustus?
Me? No, Aunt, reaIIy.
I--I swear it.
You, John?
No, Aunt Pat.
(Patricia)
Digby?
PositiveIy not.
Beau?
I didn't take the BIue Water.
SureIy not--
Oh, no, Aunt.
I'm very much afraid
someone is Iying.
Put it back, John.
I said
I didn't take it.
Suppose you put it back.
Suppose you do.
Whatever the humor
of the joke,
it's rather bad taste
to proIong it.
I think
we're agreed on that.
Perhaps our humorist
wouIdn't mind
returning the BIue Water
the way he got it,
in the darkness.
Turn off the Iights,
IsobeI.
(Patricia)
Turn them on, IsobeI.
I was trying
to catch the thief.
So was I.
(Patricia)
Whoever took the BIue Water
has had his chance.
I don't want a scandaI
in Brandon Abbas.
I wiII Ieave the box
on the tabIe untiI morning.
If the BIue Water
is not back by then,
of course, I shaII have
to caII the poIice.
Good night.
Have we
a magician here?
Or is Brandon Abbas
haunted?
WeII,
there's Augustus.
What about you?
PIease don't quarreI.
Somebody's just joking.
You don't joke
about 30,000 pounds.
But this is dreadfuI.
It's got to be a joke.
You go to bed, IsobeI.
We know it wasn't you.
(door cIosing)
Gussie,
I hate to do this,
but it's necessary.
Now, then, n-n-n-now,
wait a minute!
Now--now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute! I--I...
(thudding)
WouIdn't it be wonderfuI
if he reaIIy did have it?
Be sure and Iook
in his mouth, Digby.
You know, I'm reaIIy
very sorry you didn't
have it on you, GhastIy.
(grunting)
I wish I couId search you.
I'd wager I'd find
the BIue Water.
And if one of you is to bIame,
then aII of you are
because you aIways
stick together.
(aII chuckIing)
WeII, what's
the next step?
We aII search
each other?
No, if I have
a brother who's a thief,
I'd rather not know
about it
tiII he sends me
my share of the Ioot.
Let's go to bed.
Quite an evening.
Yes.
IsobeI
didn't do it.
No.
(John)
Burdon didn't.
No.
Gussie?
You searched him,
didn't you?
(John)
WeII, there's
just us Ieft.
(Digby)
WeII, I didn't
take the thing.
(John)
Neither did I.
It'II probabIy be back
in its IittIe box
in the morning.
Get some sIeep.
(Digby)
Good night.
(John)
Good night.
What are you doing?
Searching the room.
I thought Gussie might have
hidden it somewhere
when the Iights
were out.
We needn't bother
any more.
Read this.
When did you get it?
It was under my door
when I woke up this morning.
He must have Ieft it
in the night.
Yes.
Where do you think
he went?
Where wouId you go
if you wanted to
disappear compIeteIy
and stiII have
some excitement?
Foreign Legion.
So wouId Beau.
(cIock chiming)
Pardon me, Mr. John,
but, uh, Mr. Digby
Ieft me this note
to deIiver to you
at 9:00, sir.
Thank you, Burdon.
Yes, sir.
IsobeI,
Beau Ieft a note
for Digby Iast night
and now Digby
has Ieft a note for me.
''Dear John:
''It wasn't Beau,
but me.
''Love to IsobeI,
''a sneer to Gussie,
and a command to you.
''Grow up to be a credit
to those two criminaIs,
Beau and Digby.''
Why did they
run away?
Beau did it to shieId
Digby and me.
Digby wouIdn't Iet him
take the bIame aIone.
I shouId have known
what Digby was going to do
Iast night.
What are you
going to do?
Don't you know?
I think at Ieast
one of the Gestes
ought to kiss you goodbye.
I've been in Iove with you
for a very Iong time.
I just didn't know
how to say it.
Now that I do know,
I...
It's too Iate.
It's not too Iate.
But I couIdn't ask you
to wait for me.
Yes, you couId.
Goodbye, IsobeI.
John.
John, may I ask you
a siIIy question,
just once and for aII?
I know the answer,
but I want
to hear you say it.
AII right.
Did you take
the BIue Water?
If I'd have stoIen anything
from Brandon Abbas,
it wouId have been you.

Never have done

Yes, sir.
I'II manicure those

You'II do

You're not big enough

You think I'm big enough

Shut up!
(chuckIing)
WeII.
A countryman of mine.
So you decided
to re-enIist,
eh, Rasinoff?
Yes, Sergeant.
You must be as big a fooI

DiscipIine makes

It is necessary

immediate obedience

DiscipIine wiII be firm,

Any questions

And I wiII prevent that

But the haIf that Iives

I promise you.
CorporaI, take them
to the barracks.
Yes, Sergeant.
Left face!
FoIIow me!
Forward march!
Markoff!
I just witnessed that IittIe
exhibition of yours, Markoff.
I don't Iike it!
You have to be strict
with scum Iike that, sir.
They're men!
They have their rights,
guaranteed
with the reguIations.
I'II keep within
the reguIations, sir.
You're a good
soIdier, Markoff,
but I doubt if you're
a good sergeant.
If you're not,
you won't Iast Iong
in the Legion.
Watch your step,
or I'II break you.
That's aII.
Is this Markoff
gonna be our sergeant
from now on?
Yes.
He's a madman.
He was expeIIed
from the Siberian
penaI coIonies for crueIty.
Then he entered the Legion
and rose from the ranks.

Enter the

Beau! Dig!
How are you?
I'm gIad to see you.
You confounded nuisance!
You wouIdn't do

Not without
my oIder brothers

Why couIdn't you join

Mounted PoIice?
We just ran out
so we wouIdn't have you

You mean you ran out on me

WeII, have it
your own way.
We're stuck with you

Say, how's everybody

WeII, but not happy.
Oh, that's too bad.

Ooh, horribIe!

by the guard?
Let's humor the chiId.
This is no pIace
for high-cIass
jeweI thieves.
Good night,
gentIemen.
Say.
Ain't you gonna stay
for the concert?
Listen,
we've got to draw
the Iine somepIace
and you ain't gonna
sIeep next to us.
Did you hear
what the one
caIIed John said?
Who?
Get that man
out of our boudoir.
(whispering)
They're jeweI thieves!
WeII, what'd you expect
to meet in the Legion,
bankers?
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
WeII, isn't anybody
going to say a word?
You young pup,
we're both so disgusted
with you we're speechIess.
I'm no worse
than either of you.
(Iaughs)
There's something
in what he says, Beau.
I insist I'm worse
than he is,
he didn't steaI
the BIue Water.
(John)
Neither did you.
No, as a matter of fact,
I've got it.
I'II be frank with you,
gentIemen.
I've got it.
I intend to seII it
for 30,000 pounds
sometime in the future
and Iive a Iife
of ease in Paris,
surrounded by whiskey,
Iadies and Iaughter.
WeII, that's funny.
I'm going to seII it
and go to Paris, too.
OnIy I don't
want any Iaughter.
One thing I counted on
was my younger brother
Ieading an upright Iife
whiIe I spent my
iII-gotten gains.
Yes, I was
counting on him, too.
If you don't
mind my saying so,
the great sapphire
is in my possession.
And as soon as I can
arrange to seII it,
I'm going to the South Seas,
buy a pIantation
and start trading in copra.
He puts us both to shame,
doesn't he, Beau?
Let's put him to death
and keep his share.
AII right.
Oh, we'II have
to find it first.
Let's wait
tiII the morning.
I don't Iike
searching peopIe
in the dark.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
What the--
(crashing)
(Beau)
Thief!
(men chattering)
(men shouting)
I--I--I Iost my way.
I--I was going
for a drink.
Liar, you were
trying to rob him.
No, I didn't know
where I was going.
I was waIking
in my sIeep.
You were trying to rob him,
I know you
from before, Rasinoff!
No, I--I--I--I wasn't!
(aII)
Thief!
Quiet!
On the tabIe with him!
He's had enough!
Get out of here!
(Rasinoff screams)
(men shouting)
(screaming)
Take it easy, Beau,
there's too many of them.
Shh.
The guards.
""(bugIing)
You didn't wait very Iong
to start your oId tricks,
huh?
But Sergeant,
they had--
SiIence!
An accident.
Yes, Sergeant.
Go to the washstand
and bathe your hands.
Yes, Sergeant.
Save your first-aid treatments
for yourseIves after this.
You'II need 'em.
I promise you!
(door shuts)
Who were you trying to rob?
The one named Beau.
Of what?
He has money.
You Iie.
You wouIdn't
take that risk
for a IittIe money.
WeII,
he has a jeweI.
TeII me the truth.
It is the truth,
I swear it.
They have a great jeweI,
worth 30,000 pounds
that they stoIe.
They?
The other two.
They are brothers,
and they're waiting
for a chance to seII it.
But he is the Ieader.
He carries it.
I've watched him.
What about the two Americans?
WeII.
They are just friends.
Make sure you're
teIIing me the truth.
I am.
I am!
You know,
I think I can heIp you
get that jeweI.
Why...
Why, that's
what I hoped.
I'm sure you did.
In a week we go
to reIieve the garrison
at Fort Zinderneuf.
It can be arranged there.
But there are three of them,
and--and the two friends.
Some of the company
go to Fort Tokotu
for mounted
infantry training.
It can be arranged.
And if there's no jeweI,
you'II get
a wooden jeweI box.
I promise you.
But--but he has it.
I'm sure of it.
Go back to the barracks.
(Lt. Martin)
Today marks the end
of your training.
You are now soIdiers,
in the service of France.
We are here on the desert
as guardians
of 20 miIIions of natives.
They Iook to us
for the protection and justice
that is the tradition
of the Foreign Legion.
Yours is a high duty,
and a hard one.
The odds are great.
It is our aIIegiance to France
and our debt to civiIization
to uphoId that tradition.
Some of you
are assigned with me
to Fort Zinderneuf.
Another detachment
wiII go to Fort Tokotu
for further training
in the mounted company.
SeIect your men
for Tokotu, Sergeant.

Look where

I'm sorry.
Do that again,

and I'II brain you.
He'II be gibbering
Iike Krenke
in a IittIe whiIe.
We aII wiII.
I wouIdn't mind if it wouId

(soIdier)
Come on,
bring on that coffee!
(soIdiers chattering)
(soIdiers shouting)
(soIdier #1)
Coffee!
(soIdiers chattering)
(gibbering)
Let's try to get Krenke
to drink a IittIe.
So this is the cafard!
Did the Captain
back in Paris teII you
about his red, white
and bIue skuII?
Yes.
He was Iucky.
(gibbering)
Can't we do
something for him?
We can heIp him to die,
that's aII.
(Schwartz)
How's Lt. Martin?
Worse.
I haven't prayed
in a Iong time, but I'm
going to pray for him.
You'd better!
Think of Markoff
in command!
(soIdiers chattering)
I wonder where
RenauIt and Renouf
are this morning?
Dead, with their
mouths fuII of sand.
It's no use to desert.
Oh, what's the difference
whether you get death inside
the waIIs or out?
There's a chance
inside.
Not if the Lieutenant dies.
You don't have
to be the pigs.
You can be the butcher.
(soIdiers murmuring)
And then what?
Morocco,
aII of us.
We Ieave
that pig Markoff
weII stuck.
And you'd be weII stuck
before you ever
got to Morocco.
The Arabs wouId never dare
attack so Iarge a group.
No, but the French Army
wouId.
Do you know what I think
of the French Army?
After we kiII
Markoff and you,
I'm gonna tear off
this uniform--
(cIamoring)
Cut it out.
What's going on in here?
Schwartz was trying
to eat too fast again.
Everybody out on
the parade ground.
RenauIt and Renouf
are back!
(soIdiers muttering)
Any orders
this morning, sir?
No, you take over,
Markoff.
The scouts brought back
our two deserters, sir.
Lock them up.
We'II send them to Tokotu
for court martiaI
in a few days.
The men need a Iesson,
Lieutenant.
Locking them up won't--
Who's in command
of this fort?
You are, sir.
Don't make the mistake
of forgetting that
or you'II join the deserters
in the ceII.
That's aII.
Yes, sir.
Attention!
Stand aside!
Where are they?
They're outside,
sir.
Bring them in.
