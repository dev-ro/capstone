Long time ago a guy told me...
...he told me the most beatiful sport...
...that man's ever created...
...was actually born with 
a beheaded soldier's head...
...and obviously with 
the kick full of rage...
...that the enemy soldier gave him.
The first goal, unofficial of course...
...was decreed when the head went
through a couple of trees.
But that's terrible I told the guy.
Well it depends, he replied.
Terrible for the goalkeeper,
but for the forward...
...it was glory.
Do u know the difference between
a carrier and a donkey?
-No, I don't.
-Do u all know?
No.
Well the carrier has it tiny, güey!
A huevo, pinche Rudo!
Chinga, don't u agree?
Tato! Tato!
Don't run, güey!
It's bad for the fruit, güey.
-Didn't u say fast, güey?
-It's for exporting, chinga.
Seriously.
Asi es nuestra vida, asi es nuestro amor, 
nuestro amor.
-Es una historia sin fin...
-Come'on stop groaning, güey.
..como la noche de abril,
amar por amar...
-Can't u just shut up?
-...es una historia sin fin...
Will u shut up, baboso?
Pendejo.
Well it annoys me.
Chinga.
Ey, Genaro, Genaro!
Wait for me Genaro!
Tato!
-Wait for me Tato!
-Come'on primo, otherwise we leave.
Tato!
-Órale Pitufo!
-Tato!
Let's leave him!
So long Rudo!
-Métele!
-Wait for me, güey!
Sácalo!
Hold on!
Pedal, güey!
There u go güey, 
hold on to it!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Wait!
Chinga!
That's it, hold on to the stick,
Beto, that's it!
In soccer as in life, 
individual effort means nothing...
...if it doesn't come from collective effort.
Collaboration is nothing without
the basic principle...
...of generosity.
Everyone working for the same cause.
That kind of attitude brings us
together, makes us feel brothers.
Come'on, where is it?
I lost it yesterday, 'manguito'.
What the hell?
I need my blender, Beto.
Yeah sorry, my system failed.
Well it always does.
I want my blender Beto,
u heard me?
Yeah, yeah, I'll give u lots of those
and a real nice life...
...just wait 'till I'm done
with my system, Tonita.
And meanwhile?
We're screwed, right?
Tell me, how the hell am I
supposed to grind stuff?
Well u can ask my mom for hers, right?
I mean it's not such a big deal, is it?
No u ask her.
Don't u bet what's not yours, caramba.
Tell me, why didn't u bet the videogame?
This one is from 'Campitos'.
U say I shouldn't bet what's
not mine, I don't get it.
Well u better sell it,
u play all day long with it.
-Give me a break, I'm with my kid.
-I want my blender, eh, Beto.
More rice?
Later, keep serving, Nadia, 
bring more tortillas.
What for? They're all sticky.
'Gordo'...
U already ate a whole lot.
And they all tasted like crap.
So, where did u get them, Tona?
The usual place, where else?
Fool the one who buys them and so is 
the one that puts them on the table.
Hey, u don't call that my wife
and my mom, eh...
-...apologize, Arnulfo.
-The tortillas were crap, carajo.
I'm not scared of ur gun, eh.
Apologize to my mom, chinga!
Come'on Beto, leave ur dad alone.
My dad? This is no one's dad.
This fucking cop came here 
two years ago...
...apologize, chinga!
I'm waiting.
Apologize, chinga!
-I'm leaving for Texas.
-What?
-How come my son?
-What did u say?
That I'm leaving for the
United of America.
Next month, with the people
that came from Chiapas.
U gonna work in a farm?
No, I have a better plan, singing.
Fuck off!
Ur so retarded, güey.
People going there end up 
as workers, baboso.
No, Cuco is gonna connect me there...
...with the 'Cocoyo', he works
for the radio in Texas.
Listen son, I know u have
a pretty voice...
Yeah right.
...but maybe Beto is right.
Then how am I supposed to build
u a house mom, eh?
-Ur only fooling urself.
-Ur gonna end up singing on the street.
Chinga, the house I will
eventually build, as usual...
-...with my savings, everything as usual.
-Savings?
Pretty people, come on, 
make ur dreams come true...
I wish we had a phone, so we could call
and win the big prize.
-Don't u think so, Beto?
-Ey...
What do u think that would be worth for?
Don't know, a lot for sure.
The car is really awesome.
-Right?
-Yeah.
We'd give it to my mom.
-Damn Beto.
-What?
U always give her our stuff.
-Well yeah, Arnulfo gives her nothing.
-What about ur brother?
He's just an idiot.
The same as his dad.
Well yours was not better,
right, Beto?
Eres mi amor, platónico...
...eres la fruta prohibida...
...yo sé bien que es imposible...
...tu relación y la mía...
...pero te adoro en silencio...
...desde lejos, vida mía.
That's it!
Aplause!
That's it!
She should be the prize instead...
...instead of the car and the money.
I swear she's so hot!
Easy cabron, Maya Vega is the
most beatiful girl...
...sweet as honey, she's the most
beatiful girl on earth...
-Isn't she?
-Right poet.
Of course she is.
Which one shall I sing for u?
'Te para dos'...
...or 'Adiós muchacha'.
Let's play!
-Let's do it, huevón!
-Pendejo!
Fuck off, güey!
U smell like a hangover, cabrón.
Don't even think about comming
close to the referee, eh.
He'll give u a card.
Can I borrow some money
for a beer?
-I can pay later.
-No way, güey.
-I pay later, güey.
-Sweat it out, güey.
And here is where I make my
appearance in this story.
Hey, how's it going?
I'm Darío Vidalis.
Though everyone knows me as 'Batuta'.
-Batuta?
-Yes.
The stick with which directors
lead the orchestra.
-I seek for young talents.
-Well there's a lot talent in here.
-U don't say.
-How r u doing?
Pretty bad, bro.
I have a flat tire...
...the one in the trunk's also flat, 
I wanna shoot myself.
Do u know where the closest
'gum shop' is?
Gum shop?
U wanna fix it with chewing gum?
No, I mean where the closest
mechanich shop is.
Ah, here nearby, right?
Could u take them all the way 
up there, I can pay.
-Sure.
-No, we can't...
...Tato, we have a match, güey.
What u mean I didn't pay the rent?
No, don't drag the kids into this, 
I'm asking u please.
Hey, please be quiet I can't listen.
Hello?
Hi.
Not there, me...
Hello?
There's no signal Amanda,
no good reception.
Let me try.
-What's up?
-What up, is it flat?
-Hey, fix it, will u?
-Thanks a lot kids.
I really appreciate it.
-Thanks.
-Any time.
¡Coco, Coco, wait for me!
So how did u like my singing?
Awesome, ur awesome...
...in fact, I gave u an extra
for ur songs in the tip.
-It's about to begin!
-I'm comming, comming.
Then I give u my info.
-Sure.
-Ok.
-We're in touch then.
-Sure thing.
See u later.
Kid come here, do me a favor.
Bring a sixpack of beer, ice cold.
Ice cold, otherwise don't.
Goal!
Hey, who's that one who just
scored and celebrates like that?
-What u mean who?
-He's Tato Verduzco.
-And who's the goalkeeper?
-Goalkeeper?
-Tato's brother.
-Beto, 'el Rudo' Verduzco.
'El Rudo'.
I see.
He always plays clean though.
For sure.
Yeah.
This place is a paradox.
It's the most poor and 
forgotten place...
...where one can find 
the real diamond.
Nothing added, just pure,
a miracle.
1, 2, 3 Tlachatlán!
Tato!
So u stayed and watched?
Congratulations.
-Great!
-Don Batuta, I'm glad u stayed.
As I told u I look and promote
young talents...
...soccer talents.
-What about singing?
-No singing, only soccer.
-Football?
-Football.
Really?
I'm pretty sure u know
'la Calaca Oseguera'...
...Luis Guzmán, Alex García,
el 'Manteca Peralta'...
-Of course we know them.
-Well...
...I discovered all of them
me myself.
Let me tell u 'Manteca'
I found him in a town...
...pretty much like this,
but in Chile.
-He's a great player today, isn't he?
-Chile, yep.
I represent them and many others.
Let me cut to the chase...
...I saw u both playing...
...and to be honest...
...although u're already a little
bit grown up...
...u've got the talent,
great talent, eh.
The hell u play soccer,
very good u both...
-...each one his position...
-Yeah, just a little.
...and I'd like u to take
part in some trials.
-Trials?
-Yes.
Unfortunately, due to the group's
capacity...
...I can only take one of u.
What about the other?
What about the other, el Rudo says.
Don't know Rudo, soccer is sometimes
just like that...
...maybe I'm back next week or 
next month...
...or next year, maybe I won't.
So, what do u suggest so I can
make up my mind?
A penalty.
Penalty, sure?
U're confident, Rudo.
-That's soccer.
-U're right.
Isn't it?
Choose the side then.
This one.
Perfect, bring it on.
Penalty, güey.
-Órale.
-Come on.
-Throw it to the right.
-What?
-To the right, let me get it.
-Ok.
Whenever u're ready.
Hit it, güey.
Órale.
Hit it!
Hit it!
Very good, congratulations.
-Next.
-No, there's no next...
-...it was fair square.
-2 out of 3, sir.
-2 out of 3.
-No buddy, no.
That's the game, either u win
or u lose...
...better luck next time.
-And u, awesome.
-Thanks.
I loved it, to the corner.
I'll see u tomorrow 7:30...
...at the mechanich shop?
I'll be there, yep.
I'm comming, the car is ready.
-Early.
-Yes.
-Ciao, campeón.
-Ciao.
So where to?
20 kilometers ahead is the 'Mangobay'.
Let's go then, with Osiris. 
Ciao, maestro.
Hey, shall I bring my uniform?
-What the hell?
-What?
I told ya to the right.
Why did u shoot left?
I shot right, güey.
What?
The other right.
Other right?
Other right, pendejo,
mine, my right.
Beto, well u should've told me.
Chinga, which other right?
Mine cabron, this right, güey...
-That's where I kicked the ball.
-...don't fuck with me.
-Don't be a smartass.
-I'm not a smartass.
Listen u told me to the right...
...and I kicked to the right, güey.
Didn't I?
Were u not leaving for the States?
-Well yeah, güey...
-So?
...but now I got this chance, cabrón...
U fucking traitor!
Asshole, u fucked me!
My chance! Pendejo!
Somebody said the first wars in history...
...happened between brothers...
...and later the game to avoid
them was born...
...faking them symbolically.
It's a shame that nowadays the game
is taken by war...
...and war by game.
Especially, between brothers.
We all depend on u.
It's all I've ever wanted to do, Tona.
That motherfucker screwed me.
But you're working at the
banana plantation, Beto...
...you're not a soccer player.
'Cos no one ever gave me 
a chance, chinga!
I don't like soccer at all.
It's risky.
If u should lose, we all lose.
Well take it easy, 
'cos I already lost...
...because of that asshole.
It's ok, gordo.
We'll be better off without 
that retarded.
Don't call him like that, chinga.
-Take care mom.
-What u mean?
U know, that ape.
Don't worry, I'll be just fine.
Ok...
...I'm leaving then.
Wish me well.
Take care, eh.
And don't forget to send money, eh.
Yeah sure.
You'll see I'll build u a house...
...with the money I make.
You'll do fine, Tato.
-Ok, bye mom
-Bye.
I'll call.
-Hey.
-What is it?
They're leaving without u, pendejo.
Faggot!
Motherfucker!
-I was already leaving, Don Batuta.
-Are u in a hurry, fiera?
Hop in the back.
-Here?
-Yep, let's go.
Have a beer.
Sip it first, don't want any spots.
Sorry, lady.
Sorry for the delay, Osiris
abused me last night...
-...and I had to put up.
-Ah, no worries.
You're done, fucking faggot.
Fuck off!
Güey!
U ain't got nothing, puto!
Can't hear u!
I can offer u an exclusive contract
for five years...
...with renewal option.
My services include all
legal and mandatory aspects...
...so it's easier for u.
I'll charge a 15% revenue from
all of ur earnings.
Do u agree?
First time in Mexico City for u?
It's a monster, isn't it?
But even the ugliest monster
has its charm, Tato.
This place is mine, 
you'll stay here for a while...
...then we'll see.
In this bag there's food 
for the entire week.
-For the entire week?
-Yes.
These are yummi, there's
shrimps in them.
Right now no one's here,
but there are three other guys...
...that live here, 
not for long though.
Uy, there's only two beds.
You'll come to an agreement.
-Well... yeah.
-I'll give u a cell...
-...u know how to use it, right?
-Yep.
There u have my cell, anything...
-...u need, just call me.
-Ok.
I'll swing by tomorrow morning
so we can head to the club.
Ok, so do u happen to know anyone
in the music business?
Ah, are u serious with the singing, 
boludo?
-Sure.
-Where u have it from?
From my dad.
He was a famous singer in a band.
He was french.
Look.
He left me this.
-A key note, gorgeous.
-Yep.
My mom gave me this.
Ah, that's nice.
My mom worked, so we never 
would lack anything.
Va!
Let's think only about soccer, Tato.
-Yep.
-Ok?
-And get some rest.
-Yep.
Tomorrow's gonna be quite
a day for u.
-Take care. Ciao.
-Thanks.
See u later.
Una mujer y un tequila...
Here u go, $25 and the stupid clock.
Va.
U are up to something, pinche Rudo.
He misses his little brother, Tato!
No, I miss ur mom sucking my dick.
Yeah me too.
-She was good, wasn't she?
-The hell yeah!
-Are u in or not?
-No, no, not in.
I raise up to $50, pendejo...
-...show me, pinche Rudo
-Here u go.
-Jokers and aces.
-Three sevens, cabrón.
He fucked u, pendejo!
Hey, let's make it double or nothing.
Are u gonna bet ur mom,
o qué chingaos?
Or is it gonna be another
blender, cabrón?
U'll see asshole...
...u'll see.
-Ur mom.
-Leave her alone, güey.
Ey Rudo, easy.
-Look me in the eye!
-Rudo, easy!
Ok enough!
Everything in life is a random...
...the ball hits the post,
then either goes in or out.
So u think it's all fate?
Fate of course...
...and the effect with which
one hits the ball.
No, no!
U brought crap, Batuta.
He's crap and old.
-I'm getting him out. Raúl!
-Wait a sec...
...he's cold, just wait...
...besides let me remind u
talent knows no age, Bruno.
If he screws up again,
I'm getting him out.
Let me talk to him. 
Tato, com here.
Come!
What is it, boludo?
Where's ur talent?
Look, there's 'Jalón' García,
overthere there's J.J. Escandón.
And there's 'Generalísimo' Aceves, 
they're too much for me.
Those three are just suckers,
what r u talking about?
'Jalón' used to drive a taxi
before he came here.
Escandón used to be a construction worker...
...and 'Generalísimo' used to wash cars.
U're the real crack, pibe.
Make them look at u.
-U read me?
-Yes.
Let's do it like this...
...if u're good for soccer,
Tato, I promise u...
...I'll help u with the singing.
-What u think?
-Ah ok.
-Shall we?
-Órale.
Good.
Stop fooling around and get to it, boludo.
Here comes the magic, Brunito, 
u'll see.
Goal!
What I told ya?
Goal!
He's a scoring machine.
Sorry.
Goal!
He can do it for the rest
of the day.
Why he celebrates like that?
Don't know, the pibe's got style.
Where did u find him?
Can't tell ya, Bruno...
...I can only show him to u.
U're so full of it.
He's got talent, he reminds me
of myself when I started.
I'll keep him.
-He's ready to be a starter.
-That's up to him.
He's got future.
Our deal...
...I keep 10% of what he makes.
My pleasure as usual, Bruno.
Tato...
...pass the soap please.
-I dropped it there...
-Where?
-...there.
-Sure.
Hey!
Players are really creative...
...when it comes to newcomers.
...toothpaste instead of shaving gel...
...sometimes even the 'chinese hotpants'...
...or even the tube.
Some would rather not to fall asleep...
...just to be on the safe side.
Watch out dumbass!
Faster!
Faster!
Órale, what u want?
-Puta madre!
-Isn't it bad for the fruit?
No, not if u do it the right way.
What r u looking, güey, órale!
-And u?
-Nothing.
U?
Chinga! Fucking faggots!
Ey, enough. Stop it asshole.
Shut up, fucking beaner!
U smell like crap, go wash urself!
A huevo, cabrón!
That's it for today kids.
Tato.
Come here, cabrón.
How many weeks u've been here?
-About six.
-Then get ur stuff ready.
What for?
U're comming to the match on sunday.
Did u get that, güey?
Yes.
Look I'm not promising u will play.
but at least u're gonna be a reserve.
What? Did I stutter?
-No, thanks profe.
-Ok, then beat it.
R u gonna watch Tato play?
-I'm busy.
-U never miss a game, Beto.
Just let go on that idiot.
-Don't call him like that, chinga.
-Ok, ok.
We're gonna be watching it.
U should come.
We already have the starting lineup...
...number 20 Andrés Gámez...
Beto, help me with the kid.
-...con el 17...
-Come here son.
...el 14 Tato Verduzco...
Tona, grab the kid.
Sorry, I'm busy.
Reserves bench is like hell...
...the more u're there...
...the deeper u fall.
It's like going on a honey moon 
with ur girlfriend...
...but u cannot have sex...
...and u have to stand 22 dudes...
...in front of thousands of people.
Moreno.
Oscar Salazar.
Raúl Pérez.
-Beto Verduzco.
-Yep.
U still owe me half of the money, Rudo.
I know.
Rudo, it's for u, in the office.
Thanks, Checa.
Ur not supposed to receive calls, Rudo...
-...make it the last time.
-Sorry, yeah last time.
Howdy?
Hi, Rudo.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Rudo, it's me Batuta Vidalis.
Quióbole!
...
Do u still wanna play pro?
Well yeah, sure.
U know ur brother keeps telling me...
-...about u.
-He does?
I'm fed up with him.
Well, he's like that.
Listen carefully.
Second league opened another spot...
...for the Atlético Nopaleros...
...and they need a goalkeeper.
U have to be here tomorrow,
can u make it?
Yes, Yes I can.
Then I'll see u here, Rudo.
-Take care.
-Ok, thanks.
Ciao.
What u doing boludo, I've been
waiting for an hour here...
-...
-Well, here I am...
-...but she wouldn't let through.
-No, sweety...
...if they ask for me, u should
let them through, got it?
What r u doing?
I got a team for ur brother.
-Did u?
-Yep.
I'm glad 'cos I'm tired of
sitting on the bench.
I am doing nothing there.
What's the matter u idiot?
Rome wasn't built in one day.
-Patience nene.
-Well I try to, but...
...what happened with the singing...
...u told me u can get the connections, eh?
And I am going to...
...the best places and contracts, boludo.
It's just not that easy.
That sucker of Bruno.
I'm gonna talk to him, maybe
I'll offer him more money...
...see if u can lineup as a starter, ok?
What?
Is that Maya Vega.
Yeah from TV. Wanna met her?
No, no.
-No!
-Just let me...
Maya.
Batu, I'm glad I see u here.
Honey.
Do u happen to have the phone from
'Gringa' Roldan?
Not right now, but I'll give it to u...
...I wanna introduce u to the 
real crack, el Tato Verduzco.
-Hi.
-And the grill, when?
Soon honey, soon.
U know I can start a fire...
-...u just bring some 'meat'.
-Batu, as usual...
-...gotta go.
-Go sweety, go.
What's up daddy?
I'm leaving, take care of ur mom.
And now, Beto?
-I almost got them sleeping.
-Where r u going at this time?
Gotta go load some trucks.
Now?
-Yep, someone's gotta do it.
-Beto.
Bye 'manguito'.
U go back to sleep.
Nothing personal, but goalkeepers...
...have always been pretentious...
...bad people.
Lonely characters, they see everything
from afar...
...and they're allowed everything.
Their job is to prevent goals...
...and that's a catasthrophe.
Rudo.
Sorry I'm late...
...let's go.
Howdy Miss.
Soccer has to be everything for u,
u read me?
And as a goalkeeper u have
double responsibility...
...u have all the team on ur shoulders...
...u'll always be to blame for anything
that happens on the field.
That's why some say:
'if u wanna stop being a dude, 
stop being a goalkeeper'.
What does 'boludo' mean, Batuta?
Idiot, stupid, pendejo.
R u willing to be an asshole for soccer?
Never Batuta, how come?
That's the attitude!
By the way, my earnings r 15% from
all the money u make...
...15% from all u make.
U agree?
What 15%? How much is that Batuta?
I could charge u 20%, eh?
This is ur first time in DF, right?
Yep.
It's a monster, isn't it?
But even the ugliest monster
has its charm, Rudo.
His name is Beto, el Rudo Verduzco.
He's too old, Batuta.
Talent knows no age.
Why they call him Rudo?
'Mafafo'.
-It was clean, eh!
-U ok?
I went for the ball, Batuta.
Get out of here.
Chinga, he's just faking it!
I went for the ball.
So, what do I do?
Just play.
Say again?
What do u think about Rudo?
When I'm looking for a gangster
I'll give u a call.
-His nickname suits him, don't u think?
-I'd say so.
Come'on Fede, play.
I just remind u that the starter...
...is out for the rest
of the season.
I don't care, that guy's a criminal.
Stop saying nonsense, u can't let him go.
The reserve goalkeeper is crap.
And the other...
...do u think he's a lot better?
I can find another.
Good 'trompo'.
Go get it, move ur legs.
Seriously how on earth...
...r u plannig to let him go...
...and ur commission, Obdulio.
-How much?
-10%.
No.
Ok 15%, Obdulio.
Ok, I'll keep him.
U talk to the managers, I get
my share from u.
My pleasure.
Whatever u say.
-Hey, can u pass the soap?
-Which one? The little one?
Yep güey.
-Easy faggot!
-Don't u fuck with me!
Easy!
Here it comes motherfucker!
Get the razorblades!
-Razor!
-Let's shave his nuts!
Razor!
-Razor!
-Take it easy güey!
Ah, I had almost forgotten this one.
Sorry güey!
Sorry!
-Itchy?
-Eh, nope!
Use some powder for relief.
Just stay positive, now it'll
look bigger.
Just 'cos they were too many...
...but I'll get my revenge,
one by one...
...u'll see.
-Just let it go.
-I'll get him...
I wouldn't recommend that now...
...u just got here Rudo.
Listen to me, the fucking board
wants to pay u...
...for single game played, so...
...u need to be a starter soon.
Just trust me Batuta.
Ok, just keep it in mind.
Here, come, come.
God ur lucky.
The other guys already left.
It's just u and ur brother now.
Good.
This place is amazing, isn't it?
Yep.
Rudo here u have food for the rest
of the week.
It's got shrimps.
-Shrimps, eh?
-Yeah, u'll love it.
This is the place.
-Here u have the keys.
-Uhu.
Please take it easy until tomorrow, ok?
-U leaving?
-Yep.
-See u.
-Ciao.
'Chaparrita', 'chapa'...
-Hey.
-What's up?
-How's it going, Beto?
-What's up?
-How's ur team?
-It's ok.
We're just getting started.
Be careful while taking a shower, güey...
...they do nasty stuff in there.
Na, they ain't got nothing on me.
-U still a reserve?
-Yes.
But I don't care.
I'm looking for connections 
in the music industry.
How can I call home with this, eh?
I was worried, no one knew 
anything about u.
U just left like that, Beto.
Why did u steal our money?
No, I didn't steal anything 'manguito',
I just borrowed it...
...and I plan to give it back.
Oh yeah? How's that?
Well I made it to the team, Tona.
So what, the blender's gone...
...and so r u with the money...
...it's always the same...
-...with u Beto.
-'Manguito', sorry...
...but now I'll give u everything
we dreamed of.
-When, Beto?
-As soon as I get paid...
...then I can save some money and u 
can come with me, what u think?
And meanwhile? How r we gonna live?
-U left nothing for us.
-Well I send some money...
...or u can sell 'campitos' 
videogame chinga!
-Well yeah, I'll do it.
-Sell it then.
Then it was at least worth something.
But I'm neither leaving nor staying here...
-...with ur mom, I'm not stupid.
-Then?
Well u don't care Beto, bye.
So, how's Tona?
She sends her greetings, güey.
-Pinche mandilón.
-Fucking queer.
U want some soup?
Yep, this is feetpowder, right?
Yep, feetpowder.
Look, u just pour the boling water.
-Yeah.
-And then u just wait, güey.
-And u can eat it.
-Wait it has shrimps, güey.
Look here, they're dry.
There's something about getting together.
Like a goal after a long bad strike.
Or getting back to play after
spending some time injured.
Or going back to the stadium for a match...
...after years absent.
Get it, wake up, damn it.
Make a contention.
Ur back, güey.
Now go deep.
Don Obdulio, Obdulio.
-What is it, Rudo?
-Hey, those idiots...
...they're not comming back on time,
we're losing track against them...
...I'd say let's play on a 4-4-2...
...my humble opinion.
Then Fede stays in the defense...
...and 'Mafafo' can be eligible to go deep.
Don't say stupidities.
Come'on guys, come'on.
Ship's sinking.
Let's change to a 4-4-2.
Fede u stay fixed in the defense...
...'Mafafo' u r free to go deep.
-Félix...
-Did u see, idiot?
...u're going in for Rudo.
Come'on people, let's win this one.
Come'on.
What happened Rudito?
Did u like my susbtitutions?
-Pretty good, uh?
-Yep.
Come'on people.
...
Fuck off!
U liked my susbtitutions?
Were u already here, dude?
I'm a client, Batuta.
What's up Memo?
Come here.
-Looks pretty dangerous here.
-It's ok, it's safe.
They're with me.
Why u bring me to these
kind of places, boludo?
I'm a peaceful guy.
Let's watch ur brother instead, come.
What for? He's on the bench anyway.
No Batuta, u promised somethig else, eh?
I was a starter no more than three matches.
-Not even a reserve now.
-That's soccer, Rudo.
But I get paid on a match basis,
I have no money now.
Can I borrow $100?
-Will u give it back?
-Yes.
Ok. Here.
Tato's going in, damn!
-The freshman, we'll see...
-Let's do it now...
-...what he's got.
-$100 to the green, güey.
-$100 to the white.
-There's no white, Batuta.
Red or green.
Red, it's the same.
$100 to the white it is.
-Is that it?
-Yep, I have no money.
No more bets.
Release them.
U know why u're not making money,
don't u?
Why u don't play?
If u wanna play u have to apologize to Obdulio.
No why, I didn't do anything.
U told a coach how to coach...
-...boludo.
-Well yeah, but he followed anyway...
-...boludo, him.
-Well just get over it...
...with people like Obdulio u need
to apologize so u can play...
...that's life, kid.
-The hell with him!
-And so it is, then.
U know how, teach how to play soccer.
Look, the hat trick...
A real crack.
That's my guy, chinga!
Look Batuta, look what's left of ur cock.
-He's done.
-Yeah, right?
-So? U gonna pay?
-Did u win Rudo?
A güevo, a güevo.
'Torito' is sick, call a doctor...
...he's off the goal line...
-...Tato aims to the opposite side.
-Goal!
No mames!
What a class, how easy he makes it look!
This rookie is daring, romantic...
...he's 'Cursi'.
What a goal from Tato 'Cursi' Verduzco!
Why the hell they keep calling me like that?
We wanna be corny.
A corny season. Everyone's
calling me corny, Batuta.
It's just to humor u, dude.
U had a very good season.
U scored goals on every single match...
...rookie of the year, what else u want?
That they don't call me like that.
Don't fight it, it's ur nickname from now on.
That sucks.
Of course, his nickname doesn't really tell
what for a soccer player he was.
How he controlled centercourt.
-Relax, pinche Cursi!
-What, asshole?
-Don't laugh.
-Wait...
-...get off me.
-I'm gonna kick u.
I used to play soccer as a kid...
...on the streets, I was pretty bad.
And I got this nickname...
...as people used to say I'd be better off
as an orchestra director.
I've got good and bad news, Rudito.
Tell me the bad news.
I couldn't get a team for u 
for the next season.
-Uy! That's bad.
-Shit.
-Shit... so what's the good news?
-Can u tell me what's that on the doorbell?
-Eh?
-Damn u're an idiot, Cursi.
The board wants to take care of u,
welcome to ur new home.
-Mine?
-Yes, sir.
-The rent is deducted from ur paycheck.
-And the good news, Batuta?
Furniture's on the club.
Hey, Batuta.
The good news, Batuta?
-Chinga Batuta, tell me the good news?
-U're such an ass!
Good news is ur brother's new home.
I can bring all the girls here.
-What a big TV.
-Go, go upstairs, have a peek.
Wow... there's three rooms!
Look, Beto!
The big room has own bathroom...
...with a nice buble bathtube.
Hey Beto, if u wanna live here,
there's more than enough room.
Batuta.
The van is another gift from the club.
-No...
-Yes.
-Really?
-Yep.
It's so white.
What r u doing there? Change ur face,
come here...
-I'm good here, Batuta.
-It's not ok...
...'cos I didn't give u the good news,
not just yet.
Atlético Nopaleros made it to the
first league.
But we ended up midtable, didn't we?
Well, the magic of soccer in Mexico...
...the owners bought the UDT team...
...I still cannot believe it.
What about asshole Obdulio?
He was fired and the new coach...
...he's a friend of mine and
he wants u as a starter.
-Isn't it great?
-Seriously?
-Starter Batuta, seriously?
-Yes.
-As it should be.
-Turn that damn thing off, retarded.
-Please kid.
-Starter.
Can't turn it off.
Come here, turn it off here.
Oh, I almost forgot a little detail...
...maybe not so important...
-...don't know.
-Yeah.
This is a contract in order to record
one single...
...and the video at my friend's
record company.
Na, cannot be! No!
Yes.
-Batuta, we're gonna rock big time.
-Yes.
Exactly.
That's it.
Ok, ok, just one.
Vamos hacerle tubo.
-Tubo!Tubo!
-Tubo!Tubo!
Quiero que me quieras.
Quiero que me adores.
Quiero que me sientas.
Me urge que me ames.
Yo mis botas lustraré.
Y mi sombrero me pondré.
Tempranito llegaré.
Si me dices que me amas.
Yo te vi, yo te vi,
yo te vi, yo te vi llorando.
Oh, sí te vi, sí te vi,
sí te vi, sí te vi llorando.
Solo en este mundo,
sin ti me estoy muriendo.
Dime que, dime que,
dime que, dime que...
-...tú estás sufriendo.
-Hey, come here watch, Beto.
Fucking bastard, lucky u.
'Hilo papalote, hilo'.
-Chinga! Get dressed.
-Wait a sec.
-Ok.
-U've been watching that crap...
...already long enough.
Güey, it just kicks ass.
Well yeah, but give me a break.
-Let's go.
-Ok.
Ok, let's go.

-Yes.
-Right?
Yes.
Yeah, now the livingroom looks
a little bit clearer.
Yes.
Hold it.
A huevo. Está re-chingón.
U're Rudo and Cursi, right?
-Yep.
-U're the best man...
-...the best crack in history, Cursi.
-Well thanks, güey.
U're like a wall Rudo, eh.
-Oh, yeah?
-If it wasn't for u...
...Nopaleros would receive a lot more goals.
-Can I kiss u?
-Sure, why not?
Ok.
Mind a pic with us?
Come sit down with me, drink something
and we'll take it from there...
...what about the race?
I can't. I'm working now.
Come'on, just for a real quick?
Hmmm...
Why not...
...give me ur phone number.
I'll catch up with u later.
Come'on. I mean, if u want.

And u...

-Awhhh u know me, sweetheart?
-Sure. How could I not?
-Qué chingón!
-I love ur nickname, el Cursi.
-U have to be really tender.
-Yeah, I've got something.
Something like a crack, super romantic.
Well soccer is just like a hobby.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yep, 'cos my business is...
...singing.
Look, it's from my dad, he was french.
If u sing like u play soccer, then
I'm gonna like all of ur records.

Ok, then.

-Great goalkeeper.
And u also have great intuition.

-Call me anytime.
-Mom.
-Did u see the van, mom?
It was about time for u to be back.
-Quióbole.
-So, how u doing?
Look Quique, what I got ya.
So handsome, Beto.
So? What u think mom?
...
So handsome!
U're grown up now!
Hey, what's with the new road?
A guy named Casimiro came and bought
some properties...
...and he had it built.
-They say he's a drugdealer.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yes.
-Well it looks super cool.
Look, it'll take care of u...
-...while u're not here.
-Moves its eyes.
Yep.
Opens and shuts its eyes, check it out.
-It's really pretty.
-Let me put it on u, mom.
-Let me see mom, what's that?
-Nothing my son.
Just let me see.
-Let me see.
-It's nothing.
It's just a little bruise that I have.
Where's that fucking bastard of Arnulfo?
He left me for another girl,
don't even worry about it.
What u mean don't worry about it?
-Hello, Batuta.
-I'm gonna kill that bastard.
That fucking pig's gonna pay for this.
-What?
-Nadia, why didn't u tell me?
-I couldn't.
-What u mean u couldn't?
...just a fucking call, Nadia.
-Tato... Tato...
-Yes, I'm happy there.
-Uhu...
-Look what he did to her...
...that Arnulfo asshole.
-What?
-Just look.
Ah, fucking bastard!
No, not u Batuta.
-It's not a big deal, Nadia.
-No, seriously.
-Really it isn't...
-No.
-...just a call.
-Ok then, thanks.
I'll call u.
-Shit!
-Hey mom!
-What u think?
-What?
I'm gonna play for the national team.
Where?
-I heard that, Beto.
-Mexico's national team.
What u mean where?
-Na!
-Yes, we're playing against Haití.
-No!
-Yes!
And u, Beto?
Thanks gordo.
-Looks good.
-Right?
Sorry 'manguito'.
Really u'll see...
...the blender is just the beginning.
I'm getting u out of here soon.
Hey my home isn't that bad, eh.
I put a lot effort in this house.
-Na, seriously it's ticky-tacky.
-Ticky-tacky?
-Yep.
-Well u lived here, idiot.
Just come to Mexico and check it out.
-U'll like it.
-I don't think so, gordo.
How come not?
-U're my wife.
-Sometimes I very much doubt it.
U left from here like a thief.
Tona I gave it all back to u, chinga.
Well yeah Beto, but I'm better off here.
Besides I'm selling now Wonderlife.
What the hell is that? Won---
Wonderlife? It's a multilevel company...
...that concerns about everyone's health.
Besides they do sales and distribution...
...of food and supplies...
...vitamins, minerals and all that stuff.
Those things r just crap, Tona.
...
Well I'm doing more than ok.
I'm saving money for a car.
A car? How come...
...the car I'll give to u
once u move in with me.
I've got nothing to do there, Beto.
How come u don't wanna come back here?
U're not listening. I play for a team now.
-Cannot come back here.
-Well my home and my clients r here.
Well I don't like that guy Tristan...
...that from the small shop.
The shop has been there for years and
they don't make any profits.
-Again that.
-Yes, again.
He just wants to sleep with u...
...and leave u pregnant...
-...like everyone else.
-That's not true.
-Believe me, it is.
-Yes.
-Wake up, don't be fool.
-Just leave me alone.
Damn this kid, reminds me of her dad.
Don't say that, he was ugly like hell.
No, Nadia looks like u, she's pretty.
Right, Beto?
Beto.
Don't talk to him, he's depressed...
...he can't control his wife.
Hey ma'...
...so u like Playa Chololos?
Yes.
Lots of memories.
Mi dad used to bring us here...
...we used to play naked here.
Well, I wanna build u a house here.
-Really?
-Yes.
Yeah, we've been thinking about it.
-U too?
-Yep.
I'm thinking about how I can finance it.
So u can come stay here.
...
And u know what? It's gonna look way better...
...than the house from that drugdealer.
A lot roomier, three stories...
-...
-Three stories, son!
-It's gonne be so big.
-With swimmingpool.
This big...
...with a cocktail bar in the middle.
-Yep.
-So u can get drunk.
U'll have a room with a balcony.
Love to a mom and love to the team
r actually the very same thing.
Mom's our first identity...
...for her love we could fight even 
to the point of giving up our lives.
Every soccer fan wants to prove
no one loves their team more...
...than he does, and every son...
...wants to prove no one loves
their mom more than he does.
No.
No Mayita, not here.
-Come'on Cursi, I can't hold it.
-No.
-Ay Cursi!
-Eh, ok.
Oh God!
-Son of a...!
-What?
-U're all shaved!
-U like it?
Yeah.
-Well...
-It's for u.
-Ay Mayita!
-What?
U're way hotter than I thought.
All yours.
U know what?
The guys r not gonna believe me.
-No?
-No, no.
Seriously, Caritas for instance...
...he says u're the most beatiful flower...
...the sweetest nectar and stuff.
He's a poet.
Then 'Che'...
He's got all of ur calenders.
Tell me if I'm wrong when I say
that love to a woman is the same...
...as love to a soccer ball.
U need to know when and where to find it.
U need to take care of it...
...lead it, be gentle...
...always trying to stay in control.
Well, I know 'manguito'...
...It's Tato's place, but we'll
only be there for a while.
What u mean for a while, Beto?
Besides, I have a surprise for u.
-What?
-I'm also selling the product.
-Which product?
-Wonderlife. Which other?
-Really?
-Awh!
The total wonder is just great.
-I told u so.
-Yep, I have four from the team so far.
I told them with 400 points--
-500 points, Beto.
-No... ok yeah, 500...
-500.
-They can make it from the regular vendor...
-...to the quarz vendor.
-No, no.
And they all seemed to be in...
...I'm telling ya, now I have the team
on my side...
-...with the product.
-Seriously?
I'm glad Beto, please keep working...
Hey sweetheart, it's just...
-What?
-I have a client here.
What do u think?
This is paradise.
A huevo, a paradise.
Let's go to the poker.
I won! I won!
The minimum amount is $10,000.
Hey, did u see how much...
-...that motherfucker just made?
-Those are hits.
-Hits?
-Just do as I say.
-Chinga! What the hell is this?
-'Coca lavadish'.
-I'm a goalkeeper dude.
-Whatever u say, Rudo...
...it's just some people play better...
...when they take it.
-Play what, poker?
-Obviously.
Take a seat, please.
-Excuse me, madam.
-Make ur bets, play.
This car rules!
I swear to u, I'm so proud of u.
-Ah, yeah?
-Yes.
Did u notice the place we went dancing yesterday?
The 'Go-Go'?
-Yes.
-Yep.
Super exclusive, only VIP...
...everyone respects u.
That place is super cool, I had a
really good time.
Yeah me too, not to mention the
suit u were wearing.
-Yeah the...
-Dolce & Gabanna.
-Yeah, Gabanna.
-U looked amazing.
Unlike ur friend 'Gusano' Pardo, sorry...
...ur brother also looked awful.
It's just that my brother still
has that countryside part.
How many soccer players have ur level?
How many singers have ur style?
Ur voice.
I'm telling ya, singing is my thing.
-I know.
-Yep.
Wait, wait.
Hey.
-Can I see something?
-Here.
-Yep.
-Let me see.
Just wanna check something.
Sweetheart it's just that...
...nothing is easy, the place
u came from...
-...and u already made it so far.
-Why?
Cos' I know.
I left that island as soon as I could...
...my dad wanted me to stay working
with him at the bakery...
...and my mom wanted me to fix food with her...
...nothing to do with me, believe me.
-No?
-No, I'm telling ya.
Well u already made it far, Mayita.
Now I'm in TV, in magazines...
...and dating the most talented and
handsome guy in the world.
Do u like this car?
I've always wanted to have that car.
-Yes.
-But it's pretty expensive, sweety.
Well it's yours.
-Seriously?
-Yeah, I'm giving it to u.
Sweetheart, I love u.
Me too.
What a player Rudo Verduzco.
The sensation goalkeeper of this season...
If everything goes his way, he'll beat
the record of most minutes...
...without receiving a goal.
But, what about his brother?
He should keep playing like he used to...
...but he made it to the national team...
-...and then he engaged into love.
-What's that got to do?
Living a dream of glamour.
-He's losing his talent.
-Güey, take it away from me...
...take it away.
Charlie knows how to.
Why did u bring that crap, güey?
I got it at poker, it's worth a lot.
Hey, tell him not to take a dump everywhere...
...he's already left a mess, damn.
-The bell, güey.
-Comming.
Hi, my son!
-How r u?
-Good.
What do u think?
Come in, son.
Hey campitos, how r u?
Hey.
U're so handsome.
Look Angelita, she's grown up now!
-She's asleep.
-Hey...
-...where's my stuff?
-I'll bring it in.
Meet Charlie.
He's cute!
-The house is so pretty.
-Told ya.
Look son.
Güey, güey.
-How come u decided to come here?
-Well we had a gathering...
-...from Wonderlife...
-Wonder---
...and all the people shared their
own experiences...
...
...and I told them u're already selling
the products...
...and it's going good for u.
And the best for us is to be together, right?
Well yeah...
I'll break the record today, sweety.
Quiero que me quieras.
Quiero que me adores.
Quiero que me sientas.
Me urge que me ames.
Yo mis botas lustraré.
Y mi sobrero me pondré...
...tempranito llegaré...
...si me dices que me amas.
Yo te vi, yo te vi, yo te vi,
yo te vi llorando.
Oh, oh sí, sí te vi, sí te vi,
sí te vi, sí te vi llorando.
We couldn't get the band performing live.
It's was awful with the playback.
Not such a nice place, but...
...singing with playback is normal...
-...Cursi.
-Ah, normal.
What the hell is normal with that?
Singing in front of that crowd.
-Enough.
-Hey wait...
...the performance at the circus is 
the only thing the record company...
-...could get, boludo.
-Well, screw them...
...they don't give a damn about me.
I'm very popular nowadays.
-Qué chingados!
-Alright, u are...
...but on the field Cursi...
...stop chasing some stupid dream.
Sweety, I think Batu's right.
-Now u're with him?
-No, no.
Just let me know.
U sing like an angel, but u play
soccer even better.
Thigs would be a lot easier if the moment
we were born, one could tell the difference...
...between passion...
...and talent.
That's the same difference between a fan
and a soccer player.
Between adore and being adored.
Two pairs.
Tens and fives.
The same here.
Three.
-With seven.
-U're so fucking lucky.
U need the know-how.
A huevo.
-Like an iceberg, Rudo.
-Right?
-Nice game.
-Thanks honey.
-U're welcome.

Eight of hearts. Raise.
Pass.
So?
There's all I have left.

Stop bluffing.

Show ur game.
Three queens.
Damn.

What's up güey?
Where's everything?
-They stole... everything, güey.
-What?
Yes damn. They emptied the house.
Did u call security?
Yes, they know nothing.
Motherfucker, I'm sure he has something to do.
Call the police, güey.
No wait, it's not worth, güey.
-Just call, güey.
-Tato there's no use, güey...
...they just ask stupid questions and...
-...and they fix nothing.

Yep.

U lost my stuff gambling, right güey?
I'm talking to u. U lost my stuff, didn't u?
Yes.
I was doing great and then...
...then my system failed in the end.
U lost everything.
-And I still owe a lot.
-No mames, cabrón...
...weren't we supposed to build
the house for my mom?
-U have savings, don't u, Tato?
-Which savings, güey...
...I have a girl...

-Easy, güey.
-Son of a bitch...
...the same as u...
...fucking pervert.
Wait.
-What's with u?
-Ur dad was even worse, güey.
My dad was french.
French? Give me a break...
-...fucking stinky trucker.
-U're just jealous.
-Jealous?
-Let go!
Yeah, I'm a better player than u
and I have a girl...
-...a fine girl, pendejo.
-Fine girl?
Everyone call her the pijamas...
-...she sleeps with anyone.
-Shut up, puto!
Being 'play' ends where intolerance begins.
When brothers decide that the game...
...becomes war, then soccer balls disappear...
...and heads come back...
...just to fulfill anger and rage.
Such a shame.
What's the matter with CUrsi?
He's playing awful.
He's cursed now...
...eversince having played Haiti.
He cannot convert a single goal...
Fuckers, just look at this!
Fabrizio and José Manuel...
...screw them, how i turn this thing off?
-How?
-Sweety, calm down...
...they're just idiots.
-He was dating Brenda Solís.
-Fuckers!
In the news, they pin it on her...
I don't know Mayita...
-...don't know what's happening to me.
-Sweety, it's just a bad streak.
I wanna get rid of it.
...
Cursi, I have something I wanna tell u.
Well me too, Mayita.
Yeah, what is it?
-U first.
-No, u first.
...
-No u first.
-No, no, u first...
-...
-Tell me.
-Hey!
-What?
...
Here.
Thanks sweety, but chocolate is bad
for my skin.
Ah, but this is diet chocolate.
Open it!
It's beatiful!
So, what u say?
Will u?
Of course I will.
-I love u.
-And I love u, too.
What was it u wanted to tell me?
Nevermind.
...yeah, we can all make profit...
Abrázame, amada mía.
...good that he's working, isn't it?
Wait, I'm watching TV.
Hey, the wonderbaby for the little one...
...three times a day.
-Charlie, say goodbye.
-Mom.
-Bye!
-He's working...
...selling the product.
If u're not watching, I'll change the channel.
Hey, the housekeeper said we can
no longer keep the monkey here.
-Eh?
-Yes.
Well, then we look for another hotel.
-U're nuts.
-I cannot leave Charlie, Beto.
I'm making really good money now.
Chinga! That monkey's worth a lot.
-So what?
-Let's sell it then.
No!
It's not worth, Beto.
-Can I borrow some money?
-What for?
For food.
U already looked at the time?
Well, bring some juice for the kids.
And don't be late!
-Ok.
-...
-Mom?
-Son, how r u?
-What is it mom?
-I've got good news...
-...really good news.
-What?
-Ur sister Nadia is getting married.
-Really?
-With whom?
-Who? Nooo!
With Tristán.
-U crazy?
-No?
That guy's just seizing the situation!
-She's getting married to Don Casimiro.
-What? But that man...
-...he's a drugdealer, right?
-Don't call him that, Beto.
I just heard...
...about the shooting in town,
related to his people...
...and the beheaded people at the shore.
Only gossip.
-He's a good man.
-Ah...
-He already gave us a car.
-Ah...
-Then it's ok, I guess.
-The wedding is next week...
-...so please come.
-Ok, perfect mom.
-We'll be there, party, right?
-Yes, son.
-Ok mom.
-Bye.
-Bye mom.
-Bye Beto.
-What's up, Rudo?
-...
-Can u come with me?
-To the supermarket?
-Shall we?
-Sure!
-Ok.
-Let's go.
Try to understand, Rudo. It's not me.
I'm only moving the money here.
There are people that want their money.
Tell them to raise my credit.
It's not gonna be possible, güey...
...u already have a 'tsunami' debt...
-...
-I can give u some more, just...
-...give me some time.
-Not possible, Rudo...
...even if I wanted to.
-U have 'Pampis Ultra Suprime'?
-Sorry, no sir.
Look Rudo, u have no limits,
u always bet pretty high.
...
-...u're into the 'cocois'.
-Na, I just use that...
-...when I gamble.
-Don't say non-sense...
...I already heard that story before.
It's a lot money, I'm telling ya.
-Give me a last chance.
-No can't do, neta.
U have fifteen days, güey...
...and I'm being understanding here.
-Yes, baby.
-Hi 'cuchi cuchi'...
-What's the matter?
-Hey honey, sorry no 'Pampis'...
-...
-What do u mean no 'Pampis'?
-Hey, it's not my--
-U were supposed to bring diapers...
-But--
-Get them.
-Ok, honey.
-If u shouldn't find those...
-...bring 'Nene Clean'.
-Yes, honey.
-Bye.
-Love u.
Güey 15 days, I'm supposed to play
against Amaranto by then...
...u can't do that to me.
Rudo, I get it, but that's ur problem.
And I'm telling u, just pay them...
...they can scare the hell out of u, güey.
-Got it?
-No, no.
Do u remember that guy that fell off
the bridge?
-Yes.
-Well, he didn't pay.
-Ok, ok.
-And his debt was a lot less...
...than yours, cabrón!
Hopefully these r good for her skin.
The doctor asked...
where it hurts...
She doesn't wanna eat...
...only chocolate.
The doctor asked her where it hurts.
And she said...
here...
there...
What would happen?
Then he put his finger on her nose.
Micaela says:
Ay, ay, ay.
Wish she could get rid of the pain.
-The doctor said...
-Salud!
Salud!Salud!
The doctor put his hand on her chest.
Micaela says:
-Doctor...
-Hi, this is Maya's cell...
...please leave a message.
-Sweety, why...
-Cursi.
-...u didn't make ti to the airport?
-Cursi, Cursi.
-Look everyone...
-Cursi.
...everyone's waiting for u...
...I know we wanted to tell the people
about the wedding...
...right?
But... wait.
I told Cuco...
...and he told everyone else.
Well...
Call me, ok?
Love u!
Can u help me or not, Batuta?
Don't know, it's complicated,
u owe a lot of money.
Tell me now, how does it feel when
u're gambling, my dear Rudo?
Don't know... the same as when I'm goalkeeping.
Batuta, don't fail me now.
-U always know what to do.
-And I know what to do now, but...
...I'm not sure.
What?
I could bet in the comming match
against Amaranto...
...
Yeah, let's do it like that.
A huevo, we're gonna kick some ass.
No, no Rudo, I was planning to bet
against u.
But we're gonna win that one.
It depends.
-If u let some goals happen.
-How?
Let them win.
That's not right, Batuta.
-That's--
-Do u understand...
...how much mone u owe these people?
It's a high price.
What about my record?
Chinga, a lot minutes wihtout
receiving a goal, Batuta.
No, it's not like that, u have to
make some sacrifice...
...the only way, u get that?
Ok, ok u can't...
...don't push it, it's just a shame.
It's a great chance to help ur brother
Tato finally end up his streak...
...I've been thinking about it.
The hell with him!
The hell with him!
Then take care of ur own business
and don't come looking for me, ok?
-Be that as it may.
-And so it is.
-...
-Ok then.
Was she not supposed to show up, güey?
U're so not going to get married.
Of course I am.
I gave her the ring, we're just
waiting for a suitable date...
...for the wedding and stuff.
Get married un June, that's the month...
...where she looks the hottest
in the calendar.
-That's a nice month.
-Yep.
U're so faking this...
...it's not gonna happen.
Who r u laughing at, güey?
Fucking cowboys.
Hey, what's up bro? Where's the other one?
-There he is.
-Bring him!
Hey bros, Nadia has always told me
u dreamed about...
...building ur mom...
-...a house on the beach.
-Yes.
Just wanna let u know, that's no longer a dream...
...I'm building her a little mansion...
...here right in Playa Chololos.
-It's gonna look great.
-Órale.
Ur family will no longer lack anything.
Thanks a lot Don Casimiro,
these guys...
...they're only good for...
...soccer, right?
No, nothing to thank me, my dear 'mom'.
So, soccer players know how to dance?
Come'on, let's dance.
The neckline, chinga!
-Leave her alone, Beto.
-I'm just saying, ma'.
-May I?
-Of course.
What can u do, when after several years...
...of being a soccer fan...
...willing to die for ur team...
...u find out that someone else
is way a better fan...
...than u.
How can I put aside my pride...
...when ur love for me is like a gift.
I have good and bad news...
-...Cursi.
-Bad news first.
The board can barely stand u any longer.
They expect a goal against Atlético Nopaleros...
...otherwise they'll send u straight to
the second league.
I know, I know. Pinches putos.
...
Good news?
U're gonna marry a goddess, boludo.
And u're a crack.
Here's where ur bad streak ends, 
u know why?
-Cos' u're the best, Tato.
-Yep.
Did u listen to what I said?
The best.
Ok then, screw them.
-That's the Cursi...
-Ok.
-Give it all tomorrow?
-Yes.
-Great.
-Yes.
-We're in touch, eh?
-Vale.
-Thanks.
-Ciao.
Hasta luego.
Hi, ur calling Maya's cell...
...please leave a message.
Maya...
...please pick up, this is the
10th time I'm calling.
Call me.
Ok...
-Pinche Cursi.
-I love u.
Either u play...
...like u used to...
...or we're gonna kill u...
-...güey.
-Ok.
We know where u live.
Where u train, which places u usually go to.
So play like there's no tomorrow, cabrón.
-Yes.
-Hey...
-...can I have ur autograph?
-Yeah sure.
-For the 'Porky'.
-My pleasure.
-Porky?
-Yep.
For Porky.
-Another for my girl Jeny.
-To Jeny.
-With 'Y' and double 'n'.
-Ok.
-U need to score...
-Yenny.
...otherwise u know, cabrón.
Ever since soccer means business,
everything is about...
...the end result.
The joy disappears and fear
wraps up the situation.
No one tries anything new,
cos' failing is not an option.
Like living with a gun...
...next to ur head.
Rudo...
Rudo, just a second.
U're 90 minutes away of breaking
the record...
...of none goals allowed.
-Do u feel like u already have it?
-No, not for sure...
...there's still 90 minutes
like u said...
...but I'll give my best.
Where does ur talent come from...
-...as a goalkeeper?
-As a kid...
...I always wanted to be the best...
...and I even dreamed of becoming...
...worldchampion and all the stuff.
-Good luck, Rudo.
-Thank you.
Greetings to Tlachatlán.
-...lose, get lose.
-We'll be back...
...
Gues who's been seen this week...
...as a couple?
-Like a new affair.
-Who, Quico?
Well, national soccer player
René 'la Gringa' Roldán...
...and the model and TV
hostess Maya Vega.
-No mamen!
-Wasn't she dating this guy...
...this soccer player that hasn't
scored a goal for God knows how long...
-...and sings awful.
-Awful...
...fucking crappy lady...
...we'll see.
-Maya, Maya, what can u tell us--
-Son of a bitch!
-Well, I'm just happy...
-Gringo, a few words...
I'm gonna kill her, gÜey.
-I'm really into--
-Hi, u're calling...
Answer, slut, answer!
-Slut--
-...'la Gringa' I think it's...
-...pretty international.
-What's clear so far...
-Fucking slut!
-Easy, che.
-She's a slut.
-Boludo.
A real slut, what u mean easy?
-...
-It's not a big deal.
Not a big deal?
-...
-Really, it isn't.
Asshole.
Fuck off.
He's fucking her.
She's fucking him, too.
-He knows?
-Seriously?
-How come?
-On TV.
U already knew?
-Calm down!
-Sons of bitches!
-Easy.
-I'm gonna kill u both.
-Easy now.
-...
-I'm gonna cut her open.
-Enough, Cursi.
I'm gonna kill that fucking 'Gringa', too.
-Get off my way.
-Move!
Órale, Chepo.
Órale, Cursi.
Come Cursi.
Órale doc, hurry up.
-Here, doc.
-He lost it.
-Doctor, sedate him.
-Sedate him, doc.
The problem in loving the soccer ball...
...is that everyone wants it.
That's why it's very important to
take care of it.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Hi 'manguito', how r u doing?
Not ok, Beto!
-What happened?
-They took away my points...
...I was 10 short of becoming
'rubi' supplier...
-...to win the trip to Miami...
-Yes.
-...and the cruise over the Caribbean.
-Chinga, how come?
Don't know, they didn't count them...
...they put me now as a 'crystal'
supplier, just as I started, Beto.
-It's not fair.
-It's not.
-All the effort I put into it.
-It's ok 'manguito'.
Don't worry, I'll help u out.
Just like u did.
Thanks, Beto.
Nothing to thank me, I'm ur husband.
It's gonna be just fine.
-Hopefully.
-Ok.
And u better go to bed now...
...u have a record to break.
Yeah, it's true.
-Ok, talk to u later.
-Ok.
Love and get some rest.
-Ok.
-Night.
Hello.
-Hello, Batuta.
-Rudo, how's it going?
How many goals should I receive?
Matches r decided by one single goal, Rudo.
Ok then..
Count me in.
-Sure.
-Yes.
-All my money is on it.
-Yes, Batuta.
U just don't worry.
Two brothers face to face.
Cursi on his worst streak.
Fabrizio, do u think Rudo will break...
...the record?
I think his brother will take that away from him.
Cursi got to this level really fast...
...but now he's lost...
...and he can't get out of the hole.
What he must be thinking, after all...
...the things he's been going through...
-...lately.
-This match has practically...
... paralized all the country.
This transmission...
Paco Beltrán y Mena.
I want u to pay attention very carefully...
...to fucking 'Mafafo's' moves.
He's always trying to squeeze behind ur backs...
...then it's a lot ground to cover.
Cursi.
Cursi.
-Cursi.
-What?
U start as a reserve...
...u're sedated and I'm not
taking any chances, cabrón.
García u're in instead of Cursi.
-See, asshole?
-The same...
-...please try to score.
-A huevo, güey!
Please everyone together.
Music off.
Padre Nuestro que estás
en el cielo...
...santificado sea
tu nombre.
Venga a nosotros tu reino,
hágase tu voluntad...
...aquí en la tierra,
como en el cielo.
Danos hoy el pan
nuestro de cada día.
Perdona nuestras ofensas,
como nosotros perdonamos...
...a los que nos ofenden.
Good luck mutherfucker, we've gotta win!
Bruno López and the endless mistery...
-...he doesn't say a word--
-Here's the starting line-up...
-...I just got it.
-Last minute update...
...Cursi will not be starting.
90 minutes for the record, Rudo.
Rudo...
...mis huevos!
Chavo... chavo.
-Come here.
-What?
I need u to go to Cursi and 
ask him something, güey.
-Nope, cannot move from here.
-Nope? Chinga!
-It's ok, güey.
-I'm not allowed, Rudo.
I give u my jersey.
Ey, fucking faggots!
-What shall I tell him?
-Look...
...go ask him...
if he's a reserve cos' he's afraid of me?
Órale! Run, cabrón.
Amaranto attacks fiercely, Takeshi Fernández...
...goes the distance...
Rudo's got the ball. No!
Rudo drops it...
...he can take a shot!
-What a mistake from Rudo!
-...
It's like he didn't want the record...
-...still some minutes to go...
-What an idiot!
-Pendejo!
-...and this makes him nervous...
...a lot pressure for his team mates.
-Tamayo?
-What's it gonna be, Batuta?
Batuta?
-Double the bet.
-It's ok.
-Didn't u see what just happened?
-Yes, but--
Then stop saying non sense
and double it, boludo.
Cursi.
Rudo says...
Let's go now!
Come.
Let's go, wide open!
Nopaleros attacking through the right...
...'Juanete' Serrano leaves 
'Soruyito' behind...
...gets to the end line, plays backwards...
-...'Pecu' has a shot...
-That was close for...
...Amaranto.
Come'on, Beto!
Now, Fabi!
-What did he say?
-He says u have no fucking...
-...idea what he's going through.
-He said that?
-What r u laughing at, moron?
-Here they come!
Rudo is late, Mena aims...
...what a disgrace.
-The worst by Mena.
-...
...that's terrible, he's not gonna have...
-...another chance like that.
-And this is the end...
-...of the first half.
-I'll be back.
The best of this match is yet to come...
-...intensity will rise.
-Can I borrow ur sister, Rudo?
-U lucky bastard, güey.
-I know.
U pay today, else...
Give me the towel.
I'm going to pay, I swear.
I just need some more time.
-Uhu...
-How can I be certain u're gonna pay later...
...if u don't, then what?
Batuta? Tell me what u want me to do...
...I'm doing what I can.
Don't bullshit me, ok?
U still have 45 min. left.
Chinga, they're really bad...
Not even without me here, would they score.
If necessary, score an autogoal.
Why they don't put Tato in?
Maybe he can score.
He's also in trouble...
...just concentrate in what u
have to do...
...u're already pushing it too far...
...what is it u don't understand?
For the last time, u have to lose.
Attention!
We need to score a goal.
When things are equally balanced...
...we need talent and fierce.
So use ur talent and ur fierce.
-Who r we?
-Amaranto.
-How we play?
-With fierce.
U already saw ur bro on the bench?...
...Cos' yesterday he found out
'Gringa' Roldán...
...is fucking Maya and they had
to put him to sleep.
-What business is it of yours?
-Nothing, just saying.
I fucked her long time ago.
-Cursi! Cursi!
-Fuck off, Cursi!
-Cursi! Cursi!
-...
-...
-¡Cursi!¡Cursi!
Come'on, Rudito.
Cómo no te voy a querer.
We're waiting for an electrifying
second half, here comes Rudo...
-...for the record.
-45 minutes.
Hey!
Come!
Tell Cursi...
...to stop the crap.
Tell him I don't wanna see him
like that, ok?
Puta madre!
What would my mom think if she sees him
suffering for a slut like that...
-...slut.
-That's too long to remember.
Then run before u forget it, güey.
Cross it!
Cross it, damn it!
-Hello.
-So, what r we playing?
Not now, Batuta!
What r u waiting to put Cursi in, boludo?
-This he was made for.
-No, I don't think so.
-Besides his head is not here.
-Just put him it...
...or shall I go public with the revenue
u make on each player...
-...all the time.
-Chinga tu madre! Now...
-...he stays there.
-Ah, yeah?
So, Bruno. What if ur wife suddenly
finds out about that affair...
...with 'Mudo Villegas'.
Fuck off!
Pinche 'sudaca'!
Mena, Mena, let go.
Cursi... warm u!
-Me?
-Yeah u, idiot.
Let's see if u can break the bad
streak, u're in, cabrón.
-Cursi! Cursi!
-Cursi! Cursi!
-Cursi, Rudo says...
-Cursi! Cursi!
-...ur mom's a slut.
-Cursi! Cursi!
-Get outta here!
-...
Substitution, this was long expected.
There's Cursi, this is the moment...
...people were waiting for...
...all week...
-...with the jersey number 9.
-Looking for revenge...
...after being a reserve several weeks.
Hopefully he can decipher this game...
...the club's board alreadz warned him...
-...he could be sent to the second league.
-He has everything to win...
-...nothing to lose.
-...
Out goes number 2, J.J. Escandón.
-Rudo, Rudo u are a...
-Cursi is a faggot!
Cursi ain't got nothing on u, Rudo!
-Cursi, it's yours.
-Cursi's left behind...
...'Ruido' Rocha, and plays to Beltran...
...he's going right, and back with class...
...magic touch, he's in front of his brother.
-He shoots and goal!
-Goal!
-Goal!
-Over his brother's head...
-...
-What a goal!
-Hey.
-From Amaranto.
Fucking Rudo, how come u ate that one?
Fuck off! U left me alone!
Hilo papalote, hilo!
-Cursi! Cursi!
-What?
-Cursi! Cursi!
-Offside!
-Unbelievable!
-That was pretty thight!
-Cursi cannot break...
-What happened?
Fortune is on Rudo's side...
-...but there's still some tome left...
-What the fuck...
-...
-...crappy referee.
-Fucking referee!
-That was--
-Wow Rudo!
-Do it, Beto!
I'm ok... cabron!
Tato.
-Tato, did u get my message, güey?
-My mom is no fucking...
-...she's not a fucking whore, eh, cabrón.
-What's the matter with u?
What's the matter with u, güey?
-...he's mad at his brother...
-What's wrong with this kid?
-Rudo's asking...
-Beto must have said something.
...the referee...
Easy now! Ya cabrón!
-What?
-...he should take it easy.
Look güey, it's ok.
AMARANTO 0
NOPALEROS 0
...fuck off.
Amaranto is risking everything now.
Cursi gets rid of one on the midfield...
...tunnel on Penita, then to Olivero...
-...with the head...
-What now?
-...passes another one, filters the ball...
-Cut the crap...
-...seriously.
-...Cursi with the sprint...
-...tries to get there.
-No, don't bug me with that...
-...matches have 90 minutes--
-Cursi accelerates...
-...Rudo...
-There's 60 seconds...
-...even in the last minute, boludo.
-Penalty!
Penalty! I told ya!
Referee's on their side.
-Fucking referee!
-Give me a break!
-Penalty!
-At the 88 minute, what a disaster...
-...so reckless...
-It wasn't...
-...Rudo.
-Was it him?
-It's Rudo's fault.
-With this kind of play...
...he gave way to a penalty...
-...that could cost him the record.
-There's something...
-...suspicious here...
-We collided...
-...I'm telling ya.
-Penalty's there...
I didn't touch u, güey.
-I didn't.
-Look, here it is.
-Come'on!
-Let 'Cien Pies' shoot.
Cien Pies.
-Wait, güey.
-Let me do it, let me do it.
-Give me a chance.
-But te professor said--
I know, but with this my streak
will be over.
Cien Pie! Son of a bitch!
Cursi's an idiot!
-Cursi! Cursi!
-Everyone will eventually have to face...
-...the final and truth moment.
-Cursi! Cursi!
U're an asshole!
Tato!
Tato!
Just want u to know something, güey...
...even if u don't forgive me.
I want to do the right thing!
Aim right!
Please.
What?
I wonder what would they be telling...
-...each other on the field.
-Nothing nice...
-...that I can assure u.
-One moment...
Tato, u're gonna be just fine.
Chinga!
Beto, Beto...
Beto, Beto...
We're brothers, güey.
-What?
-We're brothers, güey.
-Aim right this time!
-What?
-Please, just aim right.
-Let's finish this people.
Come'on we're just wasting time.
-Rudo!
-The record is yours.
Cursi! Cursi!
89 minutes...
...a couple of brothers deciding
everything by a penalty kick.
A record in between.
Never...
Shoot!
Cursi! Cursi!
The match is comming to an end.
Órale, shoot!
Shoot!
This is pandemonium.
Rudo Vs. Cursi.
Shoot!
-No!
-Unbelievable!
My right...
The ball hits Rudo, onto the post
and then...
-...out it goes.
-Rudo! Rudo!
-Rudo's covered with glory now.
-A huevo!
Always the penalty!
Rudo! Rudo!
Rudo beats the record...
...Cursi drowns, loses the game...
-...
-Fucking bastards!
See why the prof. said...
-...it should be me.
-Enough, dude.
Este güey!
Penalty means punishment.
This is usually a punishment for the one...
...who misses.
The one who endures is covered in glory.
If both should be punished.
Then the game of life...
...the greatest one...
...has beaten soccer...
...the most beatiful one.
Pinche Cursi, I know where u live!
U're screwed now, güey!
Cursi was sent to the second league.
He never made it back.
...
He stopped soccer and moved to Chilpancingo.
Where he's in charge of a Karaoke...
...property of his brother in law Casimiro.
Every evening from 8:00 to 10:00...
...Cursi is on stage.
Chale, what the fuck!
What's up with this idiot?
-Hey, wait--
-No, no.
Rudo was lucky.
They didn't kill him.
But he lost a leg.
-What happened?
-He had to stop then.
-Let go.
-His record without reciving goals...
...is still on.
He became coach from a second league team...
...his brother in law Casimiro bought.
Now he gambles off the bench.
-What then, güey?
-Nothing.
-What u doing here?
-Just dropped by.
Güey, my mom's house looks great,
doesn't it?
-Yes.
-Right?
Yeah, that Casimiro is heavy stuff.
Yep, he is!
Hey, Nadia looks pretty now that
she's pregnant.
Yeah, she has a big belly.
-She's about to explode.
-They didn't wait long...
-...I think.
-It's their business, güey.
Play something, will ya?
-Yeah?
-Yes.
Ok, which one?
...
This song...
...the one u sing pretty well.
Which one of all?
U know.
But u have to sing with me, ok?
-Ok.
-So.
Quiero que me quieras.
Quiero que me adores.
Quiero que me sientas.
Y yo...
Va.
I lost all of my money due to the brothers.
I bet all of it to Amaranto...
...the tie was of no use for me.
But I'm still seeking for talent.
Somebody's gotta find that precious diamond...
...so the ball keeps rolling.
Hey, do u know who those twins in the
midfield are?
...
Héctor y Néstor Morales,
the best in their position...
-...
-They're awesome!
And it's all about love to soccer.
