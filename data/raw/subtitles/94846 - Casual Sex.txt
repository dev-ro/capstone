So we go rum-bum-bum-bum
Feeling hot, hot, hot...
Oasual sex?
Feeling hot, hot, hot
You gotta be kidding.
- I can't deal with it.
- Me neither.
Not anymore. Just the thought of it
makes me paranoid.
- Let's introduce ourselves. I'm Stacy.
- I'm Melissa.
Right now, we're both scared
of being single and having sex.
- I've always been scared of sex.
- Not me.
This is embarrassing to admit,
but I remember when it was fun to say
"Wow, that felt great.
What's your name again?"
I've never had sex
with someone I didn't know.
For that matter, I've never said
"Wow, that felt really great".
Sex always seemed the best way
to feel connected with guys.
I guess that's cos I grew up when I did.
I wasn't much of a trendsetter
during the sexual revolution.
It woulda been a lot easier
if I woulda been more like Stacy.
- Melissa, you'll never guess what.
- What?
Kenny Kreiger came to where
I was baby-sitting and guess what?
What?
- We were fooling around and guess what?
- What?
He made me touch it.
It was so weird.
It was like skin, only different.
- What colour was it?
- I don't know, I didn't look at it.
- You never saw it?
- Well, I don't know, it felt like...
Orange.
Senior year, I saw it.
I still couldn't tell you the colour.
A month after my 17th birthday,
I finally did it. With it.
- Is that it? Did we do it?
- Yeah.
It kinda hurt. But it was good.
Yeah. Did you see
my other shoe anywhere?
By my second year of college,
I couldn't put it off any longer.
I was the only virgin left in the dorm.
Except Ronny, who knew
even less about sex than I did.
Please, Ronny,
you're my best male friend.
The first time I do it, I want it to be
with someone I'm comfortable with.
Well...
OK. But let's not get
all freaked out afterwards.
Thanks, I really appreciate it.
- I guess I should undress now?
- That would be good.
You want foreplay?
Yeah. That...
would be good.
I was especially hot
for artistic types with potential.
Like Baylor Schneff,
neo-post-pop-Expressionist.
His lovemaking was just like his art.
Primitive, but passionate.
Brian Ellis,
lead guitarist with Dripping Sweat.
I couldn't get enough
of those backstage passes.
Gunther Kroger,
the sous chef that trained me.
He taught me to trust my instincts
in the kitchen.
Joey Eagans, the closing act
at the Giggle Box.
His timing was even better horizontally.
But not every man in my life
was an artistic genius.
Some, I must admit,
were very attractive strangers.
It was the early Eighties and sex
was still a good way to meet people.
Uh, excuse me.
I was never
as adventurous as Stacy.
Apart from with Ronny,
I only slept with one other person.
Gary Erdman, the guy I almost married.
I teach kindergarten,
and one of my kids fixed us up.
Actually it was Joey's mum,
but Joey took the credit.
God, I love the idea of being married,
of not being by myself.
With Gary, I thought I was finally
comfortable with my own sexuality.
To Bird, inside, over.
Open basket...
But I guess I knew
it wasn't going to work.
OK, so I didn't know,
but I had a feeling.
- Gary?
- Uh-huh?
- Do you love me?
- Sure.
I love you. Unbelievable!
The Oeltics always get the breaks.
Two weeks before the wedding,
Gary changed his mind.
He said he was sorry, but he was
going through a selfish phase.
Luckily,
the tags were still on my dress,
but I couldn't return
the 600 monogrammed napkins.
Just once, I'd like to wear a sexy
white dress blowing all around me
and not have men run away screaming.
Just once, I'd like to have
the kind of sexual experience
where you don't go to the bathroom
and cry afterwards.
I bet Marilyn cried in the bathroom
after sex.
Probably more than once. Everyone does.
- Men too?
- They can't, they're asleep.
Maybe Melissa envied my reckless past,
but some time around the mid-Eighties,
I started regretting it.
One day I was in line at the Mini Mart
and I looked at the magazine rack.
Time, Newsweek, People,
it was on every cover.
So, Stacy.
How is the restaurant?
When are they gonna make you a chef?
- Soon. Do you have my results?
- Yeah, don't worry, you're fine.
- You tested for everything?
- Yeah, everything. OK?
- You're perfectly healthy.
- Are you sure?
I'm sure. Goodbye, Stacy.
Oh, thank you for sparing
a formerly flirtatious,
spontaneous
and much-too-promiscuous slamhound.
You won't be sorry, cos from now on,
I'll lead a life of pure sublimation.
I'll aerobicise my little heart out.
I'll compose symphonies.
I won't touch human flesh. I'll give
new meaning to the word "celibacy".
Stacy, you don't have to commit
to lifelong celibacy.
Just practise safe sex.
"Safe sex."
Who'd have thought those two words
would be in the same sentence?
Maybe abstinence isn't so bad.
Beats sleeping with guys
who don't call you afterwards.
And you and I have more in common
now we're both afraid of sex.
That's consoling.
I miss it. I don't know
how to get close to men without it.
There's your boyfriend.
So what? There's yours.
Well, it's been ten months and 17 days,
and the only man who looked safe was Dr
Goodman, and I wasn't attracted to him.
It seemed I wasn't attracted to anybody,
which scared me more than AIDS did.
- Where were you?
- I'm sorry, but I got a great surprise.
What?
This is where we're going
on our vacation.
OK. "Oasis Health Spa".
They're all exercising.
That's not a vacation.
There's all kind of social events.
Dancing, parties.
Look how pretty it is. Look.
My mom told me about a cruise to Hawaii
where we can lay in the sun for a week.
But what kind of guys would we meet?
Here, we know everybody will be healthy.
- lt'll help with my paranoia.
- Stacy. How's it going?
Hi, Baylor. Do you remember him
from the Fringe Festival?
Oh, yeah.
I'm into something very different now.
I can't even put it into words.
Why don't you come over?
Um, uh, I'm sorry, we're having lunch.
Oh, yeah. OK, great.
Let me give you my new address.
My new number. OK.
- It's a garage arrangement.
- Great.
I gotta get out of this town.
Goodbye!
Yay!
Hot Hot Hot]
Yessah ha-ha...
- We're so colour-coordinated.
- We're gonna be the best-looking there.
Me mind on fire
Me soul on fire
Feeling hot, hot, hot
Party people all around me
Feeling hot, hot, hot
What to do on a night like this
Music sweet, I can't resist
We need a party song
A fundamental jam
Feeling hot, hot, hot...
- You two got the biggest room here.
- Really?
It was the honeymoon suite
when this was a hotel.
Why don't you two take a look around and
I'll get your luggage up to your room.
- Ready to go break some hearts?
- Uh-huh.
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.
See people rocking
Hear people chanting
Feeling hot, hot, hot...
Oh, wow!
This is beautiful.
Oh, God, I feel so much healthier
and we just checked in.
It's in the air
Celebrating time
Music sweet
Captivate your mind
We have this party song
This fundamental jam
So we go rum-bum-bum-bum
- Hot, hot, hot...
- Oome on.
Hey, how you doin'? My name's Vinny.
- Hi.
- You girls better be nice to me.
I came all the way from New York
to meet you.
- Really? What part?
- Patterson, New Jersey.
Familiar with the Straight Street exit?
- Not really.
- No?
What you do, you hop on
the George Washington bridge, right?
When you get past the Leonia Park exit,
pick up Highway 80,
- also known as the Passaic Highway.
- Vinny, I'm sorry,
- We have to get back to our rooms.
- Our suitcases.
Sorry. Bye.
That's your boyfriend.
Did... did I say go west on 80?
Hey, how you doin'? My name's Vinny.
I came all the way from New York
just to meet with you.
A lot of people don't know that.
Yeah.
Make way for the condom express.
- What's that?
- Just in case you fall in love.
There's enough there
for the whole planet to fall in love.
That's the point.
Hello?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Uh, welcome to Oasis.
- Would you like to come in?
- Yeah, OK.
- Oome in.
Room service.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Jamie.
Um, but for some reason,
I don't think you're Ohuck and Eli.
No, this is Melissa and I'm Stacy.
- What can we do for you?
- Um, uh...
Part of my job is to take the
measurements of all the male guests.
Er, you're not hiding Ohuck and Eli
in here, are you?
No.
Why don't you take our measurements?
We gotta get it over with anyway.
Right. Well, come on, who's first?
These aren't my hips, they're
a cruel joke that runs in my family.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You look great.
Yeah, I absolutely agree.
I've yet to meet anyone who's come here
totally satisfied with their bodies.
You may not have noticed,
but I'm not what you would call...
- Tall?
- Tall, yeah.
- And I've never liked my feet.
- Really? I love my feet.
If you want me to show you statistics
that can't be measured in public,
- I'd be happy to do so.
- You mean your IQ?
My weight's OK,
it's just the way I wear it.
Natural spring water,
from deep underground.
It purifies, it cleanses,
and everyone must drink
at least ten glasses of it a day.
Woo!
- How you doing, Megan?
- Pretty good. Thank you.
Oome on, with some energy.
Pick those knees up, pick 'em up.
Oh, come on.
Have some fun.
Megan obviously got the good trampoline.
Don't let it get to you.
Just think if you separated her
individual body parts with a cleaver,
then laid them out on a table, you
wouldn't think she was such hot stuff.
You take a flag?
Hi, I'm Nick.
- I'm Stacy.
- Hi, Stacy.
- This is my friend, Melissa.
- Hi, Melissa.
Wow,
you girls get all dressed up for me?
I was really just hoping
we'd look fantastic in these beanies.
And you will.
But you need the flags
for the full effect.
OK, dig in.
Now, remember, um...
don't show your flag
until Frankie gives you the word.
- All right.
- I hope you meet someone nice.
OK.
- Hey.
- Hey, hi, it's Ohuck and Eli.
Good to see you.
Welcome to the Spa Beverage Oentre.
- Want something to drink?
- I take it that's got mineral water in.
97 per cent, just like your body.
If it was like my body,
it would be 97 per cent ice-cream.
- I'll have some guava juice, please.
- OK. How about you, Melissa?
You remembered my name.
Hellol
OK, everybody, get over here.
Oome back anytime,
I live for making this stuff.
- OK.
- Everybody, get over here.
That guy has got
the biggest boner for you.
Oome on, Stacy. He makes fruit drinks.
He's a nutritionist, you're
a kindergarten teacher. Go for it.
No way. He's one of those really
nice guys you can joke around with.
- Like somebody's brother.
- Where is everybody?
I thought you'd disappeared,
you all look so thin already.
This is International Night.
Here's your chance to say bonjour,
guten Tag and buongiorno
to all your new best friends.
I hope you kept your flags hidden,
because the person
whose flag matches yours
will be your date for the evening, OK?
The moment's come, so let's unfurl our
flags, let's wave them up in the air.
There we go. Wave 'em, wave 'em.
There we go.
This is how it works. You take
your flag, stick it in the lovely hole,
right on top of your hat, that's right.
Just like that.
Then, when I blow the whistle,
you run, find your partner,
fall in love and have babies.
Yes, it's that easy.
Get ready. And...
Stacy, I see my guy.
He's gorgeous. Ecuador! Ecuador!
Ecuador!
Hello, I'm Matthew.
Melissa.
- So...
- So...
You know what I'm noticing?
How significant the first encounter is.
Every word forms
an irreversible impression.
Yeah.
You look really good in that hat.
Let's talk.
- What's your name again?
- Melissa.
Excuse me. Hi, could you do me
a little, tiny favour?
The guy I got matched up with,
I know him already.
I was hoping to meet someone new.
Would you mind trading with me?
I think we should just
stick to the rules.
Nobody is even gonna know about this.
And this guy is so worth it.
- What's he like?
- Total fox, way cool.
You gotta meet him. You'll drop dead.
- I don't think so.
- Please?
As a personal little favour for me.
I'm telling you,
you're gonna be thanking me.
- OK.
- Great.
You know what Dutch men are like, too.
Real handsome...
virile, and big.
Denmark?
Anyone seen Denmark?
Hey! Stacy!
Holland! Oan you fuckin' believe that?
Mm-hm. I can.
Oan I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.
- What do you think of this body?
Well, you're real muscular
and some women like that.
Oh, they do. I mean, this body is meant
to be enjoyed by people, you know?
I could trash it, but, no, I choose
to beautify it like Oentral Park.
- Just stay away from it at night.
- Oh, come on, baby, be brave.
Let's take a carriage ride
through the park, huh?
- No, thanks, I've already seen it.
- No. Not all of it.
Not that giant new monument
going up, baby, oh.
I'm concerned
about this penis-size thing.
I wanna know how men feel. Is it
really such a big deal with you guys?
Do you obsess about it?
Do you measure it and compare it to the
penis next to yours in the men's room?
Do you wish for a penis-development
cream or machine at the gym?
Gary told me they're all the same size
when they're erect.
So, anyway, like I was saying...
I'm driving this rich couple
around in my limo,
then, get this, Mr Big Bucks
waves a couple of twenties in my face,
says he wants me to get it on
with his wife while he watches, right?
You know what I'm talking about,
snapper head?
Good. Anyway, next thing you know,
bada bing, bada bang,
the lady climbs over the front seat,
hops on the armrest,
and starts begging me
to rip off her gown.
She's getting all hot, naturally,
and he is too
from all the heavy breathing
I hear in the back.
He's yelling "Nail her! Nail her!"
the guy's
having some kind of asthma attack.
Turns out he's yelling
"Inhaler! Inhaler!"
So we gotta do a little detour
over to St Vincent's.
They get out, I don't see no money,
and worst of all, the Vin Man's left
with a very frustrated Mr Peabody.
I hope that woman is resilient enough to
conquer her unfulfilled desires for you.
You know, Matthew's a psychologist.
I just love therapy.
I think everyone should be in therapy.
That would be good for me.
Actually, I'm here to do research
for a book I'm writing
on the psychosexual tendencies
of pre-menopausal females.
Me too.
Vinny, look, you don't have to walk me
all the way there.
Oh, no. No, no, I'm your date,
you're my responsibility.
Safety. There are a lot of creeps
around here, you don't know that.
All right, Vinny, thanks. Bye.
Hey, that's nice carpet
you got in there. Is that new?
Vinny, that's it, the date's over.
Vinny, look, you've been all over me
for the past three hours
and I've been tolerant because it seems
there's a funny, appealing guy in there.
Somewhere.
Good night.
I'll come in, we'll talk about it.
That's a valid point.
Bye.
Yeah, I mean, er...
Uh, maybe we'll do it again sometime,
I don't know.
Yeah.
I gotta go anyway. Really.
No, no, Stacy. Stacy, don't beg,
it don't look good on you.
Really, another time, please.
I mean, I realise I'm the best
from the East, I'm a wild crazy beast,
I'm the Vin Man.
Please, honey, not tonight.
... 97, 98, 99...
- Eugh, it's horrible.
- It's not that bad, Melissa.
It is...
I feel like a windshield wiper.
Melissa, there's your boyfriend.
We gotta do it.
- Let's go.
- I can't.
I can't either, but we have to.
Oome on.
- You having fun?
- Yes.
This is the most perfect date
I've ever been on.
Stacy, how are you? Jim Farrell,
we went to the prom together.
I took Stacy's virginity.
- How about that?
- Nick, get me out of here.
Wait, I want to thank you.
Oos of all the help you gave me with my
trig homework, I got accepted to MIT.
I'm not an underachiever anymore.
- Oongratulations.
- Thanks.
- How've you been?
- Fine.
I've missed you.
You've changed my life, you know.
After being with you, I had the courage
to write a Pulitzer Prize winning novel.
You mightjust recognise the heroine.
- Who are you?
- Kenny Kreiger.
Don't you remember?
You touched it.
Thank so much for doing that.
I bragged to everyone at school about
it. Now I'm running for Olass President.
Psst! Psst!
Psst! Stacy?
Stacy, remember me? Mike Sullivan.
The guy that never called you back?
I've been paying for that
every day since.
I'm a complete failure.
I can't hold a steady job.
I moved back in with my parents.
I'd call you now,
but they won't let me use the phone.
They just won't let...
I'll always call you back.
You have nothing to worry about with me.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
Maybe start on a clean slate.
Even though I'm incredibly sexy,
I have never been to bed with anyone
in my entire life.
Oh, my God.
Do you, Melissa, take Gary
to be your lawfully wedded husband,
to honour and cherish from this day
forth as long as you both may live?
I do.
Gary, do you take Melissa
to be your lawful-wedded wife,
to honour and cherish from this day
forth as long as you both may live?
- I do.
- Stop!
Melissa, you don't have to marry him.
I'll marry you.
- I'll marry you.
- I'll marry you.
- Who are you?
- You don't know me, but your parents do
and they love me.
- Melissa.
- I love you, Melissa.
- I love you.
- I'll marry you.
Melissa, I love you. You can trust me.
I love you, Melissa.
It was the weirdest dream.
I have no idea how those thoughts
got into my head.
I have no imagination.
- You're horny.
- I am not horny.
I hate that word.
I'm extraordinarily horny. I haven't
had sex since a year ago April.
Wow, that's an even longer stretch
than me. Why?
I found out my boyfriend
was seeing other women,
and I had to end it.
It was making me too nervous.
Yeah. Now when you're with a guy,
you're notjust sleeping with him,
but everyone they've had sex with.
And everyone they've had sex with.
And everyone they've had sex with.
Gee, I'm a lot more experienced
than I thought I was.
What do you miss most about sex?
I miss falling asleep
with someone's arms around me.
And a feeling of...
Orgasm?
I love orgasms.
I'm sick of my Mighty Intruder vibrator
with the flexible shaft
and textured head.
I wish I missed it
as much as you guys do.
What about Gary? Didn't you guys
have some down-and-dirty sex?
Um, well...
Um, one time, we did it twice in a row.
And the first time, it wasn't too bad,
and the second time,
it took a lot longer,
and I came so close.
- Haven't you ever had an orgasm?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Well, not really.
I mean, not with someone else
in the room.
Melissa, you never told me that before.
Well, it's OK. It'll work itself out.
Well, it took me a while
to figure it out, too.
It's complicated for women.
But I think it's best on top.
If you take control, then really move
around until you find the right spot.
Really? I like to be on the bottom.
And I just move my hips like this.
- You can have one with the guy on top?
- Mm-hm.
I hate you. How do you do that?
- It's like this.
- Wh... Wh...
- What are you doing? A circle?
- Mm-hm.
Yeah, just a little circle.
Like a little "O".
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't schedule a massage?
- You?
- The very best.
Aye, aye, aye.
I... I can't help it.
Why don't we try a real easy exercise
to help you loosen up?
OK.
All right, I want you to pay attention
to your breathing.
In.
And out.
That's good. Now...
try to imagine that your body
is very heavy.
That shouldn't be hard to imagine.
Hey, only positive thoughts.
OK.
Oh, hi.
Sounds great.
Yeah, thanks. It's just something
I've been working on.
- Don't let me interrupt you.
- No, you're not, I was stuck anyway.
Do you write a lot of songs?
I used to be in a band.
Ever heard of Bruce Springsteen?
- Yeah.
- I have a lot of his records.
No, I really was a musician, but I, um,
I gave it up for a rewarding career
as a health shaper.
Don't you miss it?
You're really talented.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah...
Thanks.
I do, I do miss it, but, er...
I can't complain. I'm getting paid
to stay in shape, right?
What about your plans later?
After your spa career?
I don't know.
I'm putting some things together,
I'm working on stuff, you know,
there's a lot of things going on.
Right.
See ya later. Get back to work.
Hey, what's goin' on?
- How about one of your special drinks?
- I thought you'd never ask.
That's a pretty dress.
Makes you look feminine.
- Melissa, why don't we go dance?
- OK.
Jamie, back to work.
I need an aggressive beverage.
Let's dance.
Wild Card]
The way you move, it's so expressive.
Most women would be too embarrassed
to really let themselves go.
Do you know how complex you are,
Melissa?
Um, I think so.
I feel the need to understand you.
To know why you are who you are.
And how you became that way.
And when.
How about a real drink, huh?
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't know?
Oome on, take a shot, baby.
Get this party rolling.
Well, just a little. I don't want to
ruin the effects of my colonic.
When I was 13, I got caught plagiarising
from the World Book,
and my dad ripped my phone
out of the wall.
He said I had to return my American
Legion Award in front of the school,
that I didn't deserve it
because I wasn't honest.
I cried all night,
because I couldn't figure out
how I would stand in front of the school
and give back my award.
They would think I was crazy.
Then the next day at school,
my heart was pounding the whole day...
Uh, I can tell you later.
Melissa, did you know women experience
63 per cent more heightened neurological
sensitivity during the arousal phase
than during climax itself?
Really? I like all the phases.
- I should stop.
- But you don't want to, right?
I feel so many things right now.
This is kinda interesting.
They were real easy getting on.
Hellol
I cannot tell you how excited I am
to bring an unexpected treat.
Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present
our very own Mr Nick Lawrence.
I really see you
You are really here
And when we touch
You don't disappear
It's goin'like I'm planned
It's all that I'm worth
It's strange and beautiful
It's heaven and earth
Who you really are
And who I really am
Comes shining through
Shining through...
What's the matter?
We have a problem.
Well, what is it?
I can't. I'm sorry.
- Is it me?
- No, no, no. It's not you.
- It's me. I'm not attracted to you.
- Oh.
I don't want you to take this
as a rejection,
rather as an acceptance between two
people whose needs are incompatible.
And you're not alone.
I devote an entire chapter to this
in my book.
D'you want me to walk you back?
- No, it's OK.
- Melissa, I know you're hurting.
But whatever you do,
don'tjudge those feelings.
They're just feelings.
They're great.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
We gotta find a hero
Somewhere, sometime
We gotta be strong
- With love on your mind
- No, no
Rescue each other
And hold on to the end
To the hand of a stranger
The hand of a friend
- Behind your eyes
- Everything I believed in
I see myself in you
Behind your eyes
Behind your eyes
I've found something new
Yeah, behind your eyes
Behind your eyes
I found the things that I never knew
Before
Behind your eyes
Hey.
Vinny!
- Hi.
- You're drunk.
It's happy hour.
You coulda fooled me.
- You want a shot?
- No, I'd better not.
OK.
That'll make you feel better.
It's good stuff, huh?
It's good, see? We'll have our
own party, OK? Just me and you.
- What kind of a party?
- Um...
This is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna tell you a joke, a funny joke.
A joke you're gonna like. You laugh,
you gotta take a shot of this.
If you don't laugh, I gotta take a shot.
- OK.
- All right, here's the joke.
All right. There's this old guy, right?
He's like 80 years old, maybe 81.
It doesn't matter after 30, you know?
So anyway, this guy says he wants one
last night of really havin' a good time.
So he goes out, hops a few bars,
meets this bimbo, right?
Bada bing, bada bang,
they're goin' at it all night long.
And she was young, like 19 years old,
I'm surprised the guy even lived.
- What's the funny part?
- I'm gettin' to that.
I'm getting to the funny part, all
right? Don't put me under pressure.
So now what happens, the guy goes
to confession a few days later, right?
So he's tellin' the priest everything
what happened that night.
So the priest says "Say 20 Hail Marys
and you'll get forgiveness."
The guy says
"I ain't even Oatholic."
So the priest says
"Then why you telling me this?"
He goes "I'm notjust tellin' you,
I'm tellin' everybody."
You see
what I'm saying to you?
I don't get it.
Well, they're not all golden, honey,
you know?
What about you? You got a joke?
Er, this is one that
the kids at school told me.
Why did the chicken
go halfway across the street?
- Why?
- He wanted to lay it on the line.
- You're not laughing.
- Oh, not yet.
Not yet. Inside, it's building.
It's building.
Half hour from now, I'll be rolling all
over the beach. I'll be in hysterics.
Wait, I get one to be fair.
All right. Tell you what,
you like charades?
You like charades?
All right, um...
All right, what's this?
A movie, right?
Nick, I think we should talk about
something, but it's no big deal.
What?
Well, it's kinda hard to say.
Well, then whisper it.
It's been a long time for me
and the thing is...
I feel like I should ask you questions,
but I don't want to interrogate you.
Medical history questions?
Yes.
You have be so careful and you don't
know who anybody's been with.
- I'm not saying anything about you...
- I know. Shh.
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
This is a miracle.
For once, it's all up to him.
No tubes, no jellies,
no furtive trips to the bathroom.
I can just sit back and let it happen.
I don't have to do anything.
I'm not too good with these things. Are
you gonna give me a hand putting it on?
Sure.
The good news is that
your Blue Oross will cover this visit.
The bad news is that you have
herpes simplex one and two,
Trichomonas, gonorrhoea,
Acute lmmune Deficiency Syndrome
related complex,
vulva lesions, secondary syphilis,
venereal warts,
and a potentially unbearable case
of the crabs.
But he was only the third guy in
my life, and the first one didn't count.
Oh, all contact counts.
But I thought I had safe sex.
No sex is safe enough for you, Melissa.
Well, enjoy the rest of your vacation.
I must have fallen asleep.
I wish I were dead.
Oh...
I'll be all right.
- Oigarette, honey?
- No.
- Where you going?
- Back to my room to take a shower.
Hey, don't worry about it, you know?
We'll do it again sometime.
Ohicks.
I'm the best from the East,
I'm a wild, crazy beast.
I'm the Vin Man.
That's the most intense
it's ever been for me.
I feel like I died for a second.
Me too.
Only it wasn't like dying,
it was more like sinking.
- It was like flying.
- Yeah, flying.
Notjust flying, but actually
hurtling through outer space.
Galaxy after galaxy.
I'm sorry,
I can't get a cab here in time.
- You won't make the eight o'clock bus.
- Yes, I will.
- There's another one at two.
- I can't stay here any longer.
Please see that Stacy Hunter gets that.
Melissa, you're not leaving us, are you?
Seeking escape
from a challenging environment
points to potentially serious
personality deficits.
You ought to consider analysis...
Asshole.
Hop in the back, honey.
- Thanks.
- All right, bye-bye.
- Oan I make the bus to LA?
- Just missed it.
Dammit.
- Next one leaves at two o'clock.
- Oh, OK.
I'll take one for the two o'clock.
Excuse me,
Melissa told me to give you this.
What is it?
Melissa went back to LA.
It's all my fault. I gotta go home.
- You're just gonna leave?
- She doesn't have anybody else.
Aw, Stacy.
Stacy... I wanna go with you.
- I'd love that, but your classes?
- I'll get someone to cover for me.
I'm gonna go with you.
I lied.
I was extremely attracted to you.
I just didn't want you to see
my unusually small penis.
Wait.
Melissa, you're alive!
Jamie! I am!
- Kiss me.
- Jamie.
- Kiss me.
- Jamie.
Jamie...
Jamie.
Jamie.
Jamie, you're here.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.
Guess I'd better pack
Melissa's stuff too, huh?
- I hope she's OK.
- I've been thinking, Stacy.
Yeah?
I might wanna stay in LA for a while.
- But you'll lose yourjob.
- Maybe that's not so bad.
LA's where all the music people are,
right? I could give it a shot.
You should. You're so good.
And you could stay at my place.
Really?
You really have to go home?
I don't know.
I just feel so left out at that place.
But if I go home,
then it's like I just gave up.
Besides, what if my body starts to crave
that mineral water?
- Two tickets, please.
- We're going to Hollywood.
- Just put it on your credit card.
- I don't have one.
Really?
Yeah. I don't believe in 'em.
Oh.
Well, just put 'em both on
my credit card and write me a cheque.
No cheque account.
Oh.
Besides, I got more in my wallet.
We're goin' to Hollywood.
Jamie, I am so glad you're back.
You gotta take over
Nick's aerobics classes.
- Where's Nick?
- He left with Stacy to LA.
- What?
- Jamie, please.
I taught one of the classes,
I almost passed out.
- No problem.
- Thanks, sport.
Nick. I can't believe it.
Stacy wouldn't get married
without telling me.
- Let's see what's going on.
- Why didn't she say?
Hi, Snapper.
Hey, here she is, my favourite tenant.
Hi, Gus. This is Nick.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, howdy.
You can put those bags up by the dumper,
OK, buddy?
Oome on.
Oh... wow!
This is beautiful.
My God...
this is beautiful.
Stacy, where are you?
- In your apartment. Where are you?
- I'm here. Why are you there?
You were in trouble, so I came to help
and dragged Nick with me. This is nuts.
Didn't you guys run off to get married?
No, like I'd almost marry
someone I met two seconds ago.
I know him enough to know
I want to know him better,
but that's not the point,
the point is your note scared me.
I'm... I'm really sorry
I got you all worried.
All right.
At least I know you're OK.
Stacy, I hope things work out
between you and Nick.
Yeah, thanks.
Look, I gotta go.
Are you sure you're OK? Are you sure
you don't want me to come back there?
I'm... I'm fine, I gotta go.
All right. Bye.
Guess I'm not going anywhere.
I don't get it, I'm hot, tight,
vastly entertaining.
- I thought that's what women want.
- Yeah, I know the feeling.
What do you say we go to the gift shop
and get you a nice, free Oasis T-shirt?
I used to have it all figured out.
It's like women changed
when I had my back turned.
Ah, that's rough.
You know I read somewhere...
Where is it? Where is it? Here it is.
Here you go.
The Pretend You're Sensitive Handbook.
Nice save, hon.
Yeah. I can't believe
how much stuff I got.
But I want you to know, I'm not gonna
take up any of your closet space.
What I'd like to do, huh,
what I'd like to do
is stick everything
over here in the corner
and get one of those
cardboard drawer things, you know?
You don't have to do that,
I can make room.
- You're so easy to live with.
- Yeah.
Now, here...
My contribution to the apartment.
Oh...
Well... I guess I'll just go
put these away right now.
- That's great.
- Think I got another one in here too.
Help.
Jamie, you know,
you've done everything a human could
possibly do this week to make me happy.
Not everything.
Well... I... Yeah, I know...
But... It's just, like... I feel like...
Itjust wouldn't feel right for me
to get romantic with you.
Well, you're not the usual kind of guy
that I'm attracted to.
Oh, no?
I mean, you're really attractive,
but... But, um...
I mean, I thought maybe
we should just stick to being friends.
Hey, Stace! You wanna cruise up
and down Sunset Boulevard?
You can show me
where the stars hang out.
Nick, I called into work,
there's a big emergency. I gotta go.
- Really?
- Yeah, oven problems or something.
I'll be back as soon as I can
and I'll call you.
You just stay here
and have a good time, OK?
Hey, I love it here, hon.
Oh! You think it's too late
to use the stereo?
I need a small car
that's easy to handle.
You'll be fine. Just take your time
and don't be intimidated by it, OK?
Thanks.
Wow. Do I look any different?
Gosh, I'm so good in bed.
- Jamie?
- What?
I never thought it would happen to me.
You're a genius.
I'm a genius.
I bet we could even do it again.
Maybe we should wait a few minutes.
- OK.
- OK.
Do you have the key
to room 34, please?
Stacy, so nice to see you.
Do you have a few minutes?
I don't even know where you work.
- Where I work?
- Your career plans, your aspirations...
I really wanna hear all about them.
I don't even know.
Ask me what everyone else wants.
Give me three seconds,
I'll figure out your life.
Would you maybe wanna share
something with me about your childhood?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm in a big rush.
I have to talk to Melissa.
I have to figure out my life.
I respect your strengths, Stacy, and
I think you've got a lot of potential.
Stacy.
I'm sorry, I should have knocked,
I didn't even think.
- I'm sorry. Goodbye.
- Stacy, what are you doing here?
- I didn't mean to barge in.
- What's the matter, why are you here?
- I don't know. He's in my apartment.
- Who?
There's sneakers
all over the living room.
- But who?
- He thinks I'm a doll. He's so nice.
- Who's he?
- Nick!
Oongratulations,
I hear you're married!
- I'm not married!
- Oops.
- I'm not married.
- Stacy, come in here.
- Hi, Jamie.
- We're gonna talk.
- I'd leave, but I'm naked.
- We'll just go in here.
- Why is Nick suddenly living with you?
- I thought I was in love with him.
I think it was the sex.
I was celibate for so long,
I felt like a can of kitchen cleanser.
You know,
sterile and gritty and abrasive.
And when we made love...
I don't know, I felt like a human again.
A mammal, with breasts.
- Also, he's very talented...
- Stop.
Not the "talented" thing.
OK. I know, you're right.
He's the same guy again.
So what are you going to do?
Well, maybe we could stay together
until Nick gets settled in LA and...
Stacy, end it.
Go back to LA and just do it.
- You're right.
- I am, aren't I?
I'm gonna do it.
It's a test of my new maturity.
I'm sorry.
- Oh, Jamie's in there.
- I know. Oan you believe it?
Aw, did he have one too?
- It didn't work. It didn't work.
- What?
The book. The book.
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not mad.
A guy like me cannot pretend.
Do you understand? I'm from Jersey.
I know this guy Joey. He's in jail now.
He kills three people with a knife,
but he didn't fake it, he did it!
Look, Frankie, I gotta get out of here,
I gotta get back to my roots.
- Do some thinking.
- I'm sorry, I tried.
Yo, you've been beautiful.
You're special. I relate to you.
Goodbye.
- Think she'll do it?
- I hope so.
Hey, Stace! Yo.
Would you give me a lift
to the bus station?
I've had it with this place. I promise,
I won't hit on you, I won't breathe.
- Oome on.
- OK, hurry up.
Thanks.
I appreciate this, really.
Oh, man.
Much better.
- So why are you leaving?
- I was having too much fun.
I tell you something, I give up
on this whole relationship thing.
I was bombing out so bad at that place,
I would've shaved between my eyebrows
if I thought it would help.
Tell me something.
- How do you do it?
- Do what?
This whole man/woman
relationship thing. I mean...
How do you do it?
Like when you're with your friends
and you can just talk and do whatever.
Someone you're comfortable with,
you know?
Only, like... You know,
like on a romantic level.
OK, when I first met Vinny I thought,
"This guy is a living argument
for birth-control."
But as I get to know him better,
I realise he's just like the rest of us.
A mess.
I dropped Vinny off at the bus station
and rushed home to face Nick.
I'd rehearsed every word
I was going to say out loud.
I'd covered all the angles.
There was no way he'd talk me out of it.
- Stace?
- Nick?
Hey, I went shopping.
Boy, these are gonna last forever.
And wait till you see the stuff I got
for you to make us breakfast.
Waffles.
Great stuff, huh? And I got
this big thing of butter. Look...
Nick. Nick! This isn't working.
Why, you don't like waffles?
It's... It's not that.
It's that we don't... have any syrup.
You know,
it's like I was meant to come here.
I mean, everything, it feels so right.
- Really?
- Yeah, I feel so inspired.
Last night when you were working,
I started on this new song.
Guess what it's called?
- Stacy.
- Wow.
It's got this really great bass line
in it. Just listen to this.
- Nick. Nick, that's great but...
- OK, right.
Ba da boo, ba da, ba da, Stacyl
- Nick!
- Oh, Stacyl OK.
- Anyway, that's all I got so far.
- Nick, really, I like it.
Look, this is kind of difficult to say,
but I... kind of have a problem.
What, is it about money?
Don't worry, I can get some dumb job
until something else happens.
I am feeling so confident, really.
It's not about the money,
it's about us living together.
- You wanna get a bigger place?
- It's not the size of the apartment.
Well, what is it?
I know that I... convinced you
to come here,
and I know I helped you quit yourjob,
but it's about our relationship.
Nick! It's not gonna work.
Whoa... I thought we had
something pretty special here.
It's not your fault, it's me.
I'll end up taking care of you
and forget about myself.
Aw, you don't have
to take care of me. Ohrist!
Nick, I will. You don't know me!
I'm that way with men, I...
I just lose myself, I disappear.
But you heard them when I was singing,
didn't you? They loved me!
It's gonna be the same way here in LA!
I can't do it this time, Nick,
I'm sorry.
OK, that's OK.
But let me tell you,
you're making a big mistake.
- Oos I am gonna make it.
- Good.
I'm gonna be huge.
I'm gonna be bigger than huge!
I'm gonna be on the cover of
Rolling Stone Maga... No, forget that.
I'm gonna be on the cover
of Time Maga... No!
Forget that. I...
I... am gonna have...
more fans than Elvis!
Good.
Yeah!
And I won't even be dead.
Think about it.
Well, Nick packed up his Heftys
and I haven't heard from him since.
After Nick, I kinda took a break
from guys for a while...
again.
- You got me.
- I know.
But I was hoping
for something more romantic.
Oh.
- Tell them about the letter.
- You think?
Yeah, tell them.
OK.
"Dear Stacy,
I hope you don't mind me writing,
but the only other letter I ever wrote
was to the editor of Flex magazine
to say how much
I enjoyed this article called..."
Hammer Those Glutes
Till Your Butt's Like A Bowling Ball.
So it wasn't exactly personal.
So why do I now take pen in hand
to write to you?
OK, it's like this.
Ever since I got home from Oasis,
things are different.
Like, all of a sudden, I don't feel
like hanging out every night.
I don't feel like hitting on women
or even drinking milk out of the carton.
I feel...
I don't know, serious.
Like I'm in the midst
of some heavy changes.
I forced myself to take a closer look
at the Vin Man.
You know, open him up, pull him out,
dissect him. Like a frog.
And I've decided
to go after a more sharply-tailored,
finely-pleated, subtly-striped look.
And I've discovered I have
a creative side to my personality.
Hey!
Anyway, since most of my friends
saw the Vin Man
as a larger-than-life legendary figure,
many are having difficulties
relating to me at this time,
but since you didn't know me for long,
I figured it might be easier
for you to understand.
Besides, you're one of the few people
I know who could appreciate this.
"Respectfully, your friend,
Vincent Valconie."
What can I say? Life is bizarre.
- You have to go so early?
- We still have champagne.
I'm kind of tired, and besides,
you two should be alone. Here.
- OK. Good night.
- Bye-bye.
- Happy New Year!
- OK, thanks! Bye.
Hey. Need a lift?
Ah, Vinny! What are you doing here?
I was just driving
around the neighbourhood.
That's not it. Look, it's like this.
It's Ohristmas Day,
I'm sitting around my house all alone,
so I hop in the limo,
24 hours later I wind up in Ohicago.
And I'm saying to myself,
"Vincent, where the hell are you going?"
That's when it hits me.
I'm coming to see you.
You drove all that way just to see me?
Only four days and 18 speeding tickets.
But it's OK, I got my own business now.
- I got four stretch limos.
- Wow.
Yeah, fully loaded, the works.
Hey, but look.
You know, I realise
I didn't call or nothing, so...
If you got some plans...
Ah, well, I was gonna...
I have nothing to do.
I'm just going home.
Maybe we could do something,
play some miniature golf or something.
- Vinny, it's late.
- Yeah, I know.
All right, that's all right, you know.
I mean, hey. You know,
I felt like taking a drive anyway.
It's New Year's Eve. You probably
had a wild night or something.
I mean, who needs a visit
from the Vin Man on New Year's Eve?
I understand. Hey, look.
You have a good New Year's, all right?
I'm gonna take off.
Vinny.
You want some breakfast?
Um, I could eat something. I'm kinda
hungry. I've been driving a while.
I could make you an omelette.
Oh, yeah? You're a good cook?
I've been doing some cooking myself.
How about I make you an omelette, huh?
That would be nice.
Wait a minute,
hang on, I got... Hang on...
What?
Oome here.
Merry Ohristmas.
Oh, my God!
What's his name?
I didn't give him a name.
You choose something.
I don't know. He's chewing my hair up!
Look at his little face.
He's so cute.
He's a cute one, huh?
Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing
and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up
bushels of fun
Now thejingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell...
Jingle bells chime

Dancing and prancing

Merry Ohristmas!
So glad you could make it.
- Oh! What do you say, big guy?
- Put 'em by the tree.
- Hi, Melissa.
- Merry Ohristmas.
Oome on, Daddy.
- Hey, come here.
- Oowboys, cowboys!
Daddy, come on.
- Melissa.
- What?
- There's your boyfriend.
- So what? There's yours.
Yeah. There's my boyfriend.
