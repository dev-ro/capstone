The Golem: How He Came Into the World
Directed by Paul Wegener
Carl Boese
The first chapter.
The learned Rabbi Loew reads in the
stars that misfortune threatens the Jews.
I must speak with Rabbi Jehuda
- danger threatens our people.
Call all the elders of the
community together to pray.
The stars predict disaster.
DECREED: AGAINST THE JEWS,
We can no longer neglect
the popular complaints against the Jews.
They despise the holy Christian ceremonies;
They endanger the lives and property
of their fellow-men;
They practice black magic.
We decree that all Jews shall leave
the city and all territory in sight of the city
before the month is ended.
-Imperator
Knight Florian, deliver
our edict to the Ghetto.
Venus enters the constellation of Libra!
The auspicious hour has come
to summon the dread spirit Astaroth,
and compel him to reveal the magic word.
Then we can bring the Golem
to life to save our people.
A messenger from the
Emperor is here.
Come with me to the High Rabbi Loew,
who is like a father to our whole community.
It was I who drew the Emperor's horoscope.
I warned him twice of danger.
Tell him now that i humbly
request an audience with him.
The end of the first chapter.
The second chapter.
The hour has come.
The stars favor the wizard.
Guard this secret
with your life.
Knight Florian brings
the Emperor's answer.
In memory of your services
we will grant you an audience.
Come to the festival at the castle,
and amuse us again
with your magical arts.
You shame me, but I will
soon have a guardian for you.
If we can compel the powers of darkness
to reveal the magic word,
we can bring the Golem to life.
Who will know the magic word?
NERYO MANTJE
The message to give back the dead to the life.
He who possesses the key of Solomon
can force Astaroth to reveal the word.
The hour has come!
Astaroth, Astaroth, appear!
Tell me the magic word!
The word, that so terrible word,
I have snatched it.
Now I give back the Golem to the life
The end of the second chapter.
The third chapter.
A strange crew.
This is my new servant, Golem.
The Golem's first appearance on the street.
This is the Rabbi's new servant.
He cannot speak, but he will not harm you.
He will come to you each day,
with a list of the articles we need.
I go today to show the Golem to the Emperor.
Stay and guard the house.
The Rose Festival
At the time appointed by the Emperor
for the arrival of your father,
I will leave the castle and come to you.
I have bribed your warden.
Place a light in your window as a sign that
you are waiting for me.
Florian
He is my creature, called Golem.
More I may not tell you.
What manner of miracle will you
show us today, strange magician?
I will show you our people's
history, and our patriarchs.
And if you value your lives,
let no one speak or laugh.
Moses, the eternal Jew.
Save me, and I will
pardon your people.
The end of the third chapter.
The fourth chapter.
We are saved!
The Emperor has withdrawn his decree.
Awake the sleeping brethren
with the joyful sound of the Schofa-horn!
Let us rejoice!
If you have brought the dead to life
through magic, beware of that life.
When Uranus enters the house of the planets,
Astaroth will demand his creature.
Then the lifeless clay will scorn its master
& turn to destroy him and all it meets.
Your task, Golem, is fulfilled.
Be lifeless clay once again,
lest the powers of darkness
take vengeance.
Master, Jehuda waits below
with the elders to escort you
to the synagogue
for the ceremony of thanks.
After all have left,
steal through the gate.
I will be the first to bring
the joyful news to Miriam!
I am not ready.
Go and I will follow you.
No, I will wait and take
you to the synagogue.
In there is a stranger who has
brought shame on us. Seize him!
The end of the fourth chapter.
The fifth chapter.
Your house is in flames
- the Golem is raging.
The demon has carried Miriam away
- destroying everything in his path!
Rabbi, save us, or
we shall all perish!
Let us show our gratitude
to the great Rabbi Loew.
Rabbi Loew, the people are here
to thank you for preserving their safety.
The Rabbi's house is in ruins
and every trace of the stranger is lost.
No other man knows or suspects.
I shall be silent forever - will you forgive me?
The Golem, the Golem.
But where is the Golem?
The gate has been forced!
The Golem must be there
Give thanks to Jehovah, for today
He has thrice shown His love for His people.
