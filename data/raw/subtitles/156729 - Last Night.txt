Yes, dear.
Hi. I'm sorry--
l'llbe withyou

Let's go. There may be some
unfamiliar faces in here.
¢Ü¢Ü[ "Silent Night"]
Hi.
Your esteemed
grandmother.
There he is.
Oh, you look so handsome
in that suit.
And Rose.
Yes, well-- Rose.
Rose from Edmonton.
You remember
Rose from Edmonton.
Rose from Edmonton.
Your dear sister
jennifer.
Hi.
Alex.
Alex. I thought
that was you.
I didn't know you
were back in the picture.
I thought you had fled to, um--
Patrick. Patrick, shut up.
To the hills
or wherever--
He comes back
when it counts.
Yeah, but I'm surprised
you could come.
lthoughtyou'dhave
some big familything--
some bigpig roast.
Patrick !
What ? l'm greetinghim
like a brother.
- You're being obnoxious.
- Yeah, well, exactly.
Don't pay any attention.
He's trying to be funny.
Actually, we are going
to my parents after.
So, let's enjoy
the time we have.
- We werejust opening
the stockings.
- Where's mine ? You started ?
Well, we couldn't wait forever.
I don't know. Maybe there
isn't anything left.
What did you get ?
Is this yours ?
She gave you all this ?
All ofthis
great stuff.
One ofthese, yeah.
Isn't it a little
late for that ?
It's old.
From when I was a kid.
She's wrapping this old
stuff up from the attic.
It's like nostalgia.
Right.
- Did you notice the tree ?
- [Grandmother]
lt'sa nice tree.
Your old dad,
he got out the chain saw,
and he dragged it back...
from the front yard
ofthe Winterson house.
It's quite the tree.
You remember Hazel Winterson.
[Mr. Wheeler] They were
one ofthe first to leave.
[Grandmother]
Well, l'm notsurprised.
Here we are.
Ooh, aren't you lucky.
look whatSanta
broughtyou last night.
Yea !
Not that you
deserve it.
Thankyou, Santa.
Imagine. Coming late
to Christmas.
Ah, ah, ah.
Not in the fire.
- Oh, right. It's fake.
- What do you mean, it's fake ?
It's not fake.
It's not for burning.
Use the bag.
Whenyou two were kids,
you always used
to wake usat 6.:00.
""Oh, can we open
the presents now, Mom ?
Mom-- Mom, it's Christmas.
Wake up, Dad !""
Well, no point
trying to go to sleep.
But your father
put his foot down.
""No opening the presents
until your grandma arrives.""
We had to put a skipping rope
across the stairs...
just to keepyou
fromgettingat the tree.
- Skipping rope ?
- [Mr. Wheeler]
l'm surprisedit worked.
Now he comes
an hour late.
Uh, well, Mom, there are
two really good excuses
I can think of...
that maybe
youshouldkeep in mind.
For one thing, it's not really
Christmas today, is it, Mom ?
Andforanotherthing,
it's the endofthe world.
The worldis ending tonight
at midnight,
andthat'skept me
prettyoccupiedlately.
I'll check the dinner.
Would it hurt you
to play alongjust once ?
lt meansa lot to her--
to have herfamily.
I'm sorry.
Today ofall days.
All right.
Okay, I'm opening.
Uh, can I open
the big one first ?
Wait foryour mother.
Mom ! Mom !

You treat me so well.
Well, you get one

if I'm not mistaken.
I thought
I'd try it myself.
I thought
you never noticed.
Oh, but I did.
So, how goes the battle ?
Fine. Good.
Good old computer.
Hmm.
Well, imagine,
even tenyears ago...
you'd have to have
eight or nine stations
just to keep the system running.
I know.
But now--
Now.
just you.
And you.
Well, l--
l'm almost done.
Oh.
Oh, you've

Good evening,
Mrs. R. Wheeler.
I'm calling from
the gas company,
and wejust wanted to thankyou
for being our customer
over the years.
I hope you are doing well
and spending these final hours
of peace with your loved ones.
Rest assured that we will do
our utmost to keep the gas
flowing right until the end.
Thankyou and good-bye.
[Dialing]
[line Ringing]
[Telephone Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
Will somebody get that !
[Ringing Continues]
just leave it, Mom !
Leave it to the machine !
ButAunt Margo
is taking the whole family,
[Ringing Continues]
including
the Simpson clan,
up north to Muskoka.
And she says
the whole congregation is
going to meet around the lake.
And at midnight,
or a quarter to, I guess,
they're all going out
in canoes.
[Jennifer]
Oh, my God!
Excruciating.
Imagine ending it all
singing ""Kumbaya.""
Yes, well, she is
with the United Church.
Tah-dah !
[All] Oh !
[Jennifer] There she is !
Your mother knows
how to handle a turkey.
What a bird.
Don't butcher it.
I'll be right back.
What's she
talking about ?
Rose,
you like the dark ?
Yes, please.
There were people
in the street again today.
ltseems
togo in cycles.
You be careful whenyou leave.
Don'tgo out in thestreets
unlessyou have to.
Oh, come on, Dad.
They're safe.
They'rejust having fun.
Oh, that's fun, is it ?
I'm not so sure.
lhave to admit
they've been better
the last while.
But that'snotsayingmuch,
comparedto the first months.
Rememberthat nonsense ?
There's
two sides.
To what ?
Well, I mean,
I understand.
You understand what ?
Whypeople do it.
Go crazy in thestreet.
Mother, I have a little ham
you might prefer.
Foryour condition.
People are destroying things,
killingpeople--
It'sjust a--
just a chance to--
to blow some off.
What ? Heads ?
Steam.
Steam. Oh, mymistake.
Yeah.
Blow offsome steam.
Right. Alex, I think maybe
I should mention, before
you make any faux pas here,
that we have a tradition
in this family-- that we
don't kill other people.
Patrick, that'snot
what he's saying.
You know what he means.
People want
to experience things.
And we're all gonna
die anyway, so--
That gives us all
the more reason to be civil.
Now more than ever
we should be courteous
and respect each other's needs.
It's a test ofour values.
Sweetheart, you joining us ?
Nice speech, Dad.
[Grandmother]
Oh ! Golly!
Wow. Look at that.
I know that this is a bit much,
but, Patrick, you always
loved lamb.
Well,
that should do it.
We didn't want anyone
to starve.
Well, thank God,
we don't have to fit
in those canoes.
I'm stuffed
just looking at it.
I wanted you to have
something special,
so when you
go home, Patrick,
alone at midnight,
you'llrememberyour
parents weren'tso bad.
Sweetheart,
is that all or--
Yes, I'm ready.
[Patrick]
Oh, Christ.
Let's say grace.
For what we are
about to receive,
may the Lord
make us truly thankful.
Amen.
[ Crying ]
Amen.
Mom, I told you about
this three weeks ago.
Why can't you just stay
a couple of hours ?
You haven't
got anybody
to go home to.
Mom, I made a decision
about where I want to be
when it happens.
And I'm sorry,
but you're going
to have to accept that.

Um, should I take off
my clothes ?
No.

l'llbe there in a minute.
[Glasses Clinking]
Thanks.
You're welcome.
You don't remember me,
do you ?
No.
We met once before
at, uh, a party.
At, uh,
Basil's place.
I used to go
to a lot of parties.
Yeah. Well, that's
how I got your number.
Through a friend of Basil's.
I was asking around,
and, uh-- Chris Fenton
is his name.
Anyway, he was talking
about this one girl--
beautiful girl--
and, uh, click,
like that, I remembered.
That's very sweet.
So we should, uh,
head to the bedroom ?
Yep.
Go ahead.
I'll be with you
in a minute.
[Clicking]
¢Ü¢Ü [ Soft R&B ]
¢Ü¢Ü[Continues]
More ?
No.
No. You don't have to.
What I was trying
to say out there is
that you're very beautiful.
And I knew that before.
I just want you to know
that I'm not doing this
because you're black.
Yes, you are.
You don't have to lie.
Yeah.
So, uh, before
we get started,
uh, there's a couple
ofthings I'd like to try.
Uh, nothing too weird,
I thinkyou'll agree.
But, um, you know,
ifthere's anything
you had in mind--
Yes.
Uh,
maybe you could
tell me before
so we can fit it in.
Hey.
Don't worry.
You'll bejust fine.
I just wanted
to have an orgasm today.
I'll do my best.

Oh, uh, those were done

So, you're going

Nope.

No. I'm staying here

Oh. Then I'll wait here
a minute. Do you mind ?
I just went out
to pick up some things,
and my husband is... somewhere.
I have to get home.
Would you like
a magazine or something ?
Something to eat ?
Don't entertain me.
just do what you were doing.
Candy cane ?
My-- My mother,
shejust threw this
big Christmas dinner.
She wanted us to relive
our happiest moments
as a family.
So she took all this stuff
from our childhood...
and wrapped it up and
gave it to us as gifts.
[Woman]
Thisstuff?
Yeah, there's, uh, these
oldreport cardshere...
and, um,
awards that I won...
and these
little craft things.
That.
Let me see that.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, diving.
Yeah. Must have
been my sister's.
I think I had
some ofthese.
Pete Seeger.
That rings a bell.
Yeah, my mother
says I love that.
Guantanamera.
She sounds nice.
Who ? My mother ?
That she would do all this ?
No, that she
gave you Pete Seeger
when you were a kid.
Oh, well, uh,
I don't want to give you
the wrong impression.
It's not
exactly indicative
of my family.
Actually, we had
this big fight when--
when I told her there
were socialist implications.
To what ? Pete Seeger ?
""Oh, Patrick,
why do you have to go and
spoil everything nice ?""
Oh, I didn't know.
What ?
That he was a socialist.
Oh, well, you know,
folk music.
He had these
sing-along things, right ?
Uh, yeah.

Pete Seeger,

So, this is

where you live.
Isn't it nice.
Is it ?
It is.
And what had you
been doing again ?
What do you mean,
before ?
Before. With your life.
Um,
well, I--
I finished, uh,
school, finally.
And, uh-- uh, yeah,
I took a couple
ofyears off.
I was going
to med school.
So... I guess
I would have been
a doctor ofsome sort.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I always knew
you had it in you.
Isn't it nice how things
worked out so well ?
And you grew up so... nicely.
You're a handsome man.
Well, thankyou.
So--
Uh, can I get you
something to drink ?
lhave drinks.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thankyou.
[ Laughs ]
So, Craig, um, you probably
won't want to hear this,
but I saw your stepmother
at the Super Save last week.
And she has met another man
and married him
as you may know.
And she made me promise
that if I ran into you,
I would tell you that
you're welcome, ifyou want,
tojoin their circle.
Their circle ?
Right.
Their prayer circle.
They're all meeting
at Mel Lastman Square.
And for the 24 hours
leading to the end,
they're going to pray
for the souls of humanity.
Ofcourse you've missed
the beginning by now,
but I'm sure
you can join in
wheneveryou come.
Uh-huh. Well, as much
as that sounds like fun--
[ Both Laughing ]
You have your own way
to worship, I guess.
Yeah, I-- I--
I guess I do.
Give me a hug.
[ Moaning ]
I was surprised
by your call.
And happy.
You know,
you were always a favorite.
My favorite student.
You were
a favorite of mine.
Well, I know now.
We should, um,
head to the bedroom.
¢Ü I'm watching you ¢Ü
¢Ü The way you move
your sexy body ¢Ü
¢Ü I'm liking
the things you do ¢Ü
¢Ü The way you move ¢Ü¢Ü
Even when you're
with someone else,
you're still by yourself.
And I don't think
that's pathetic.
I don't think that's sad.
Oh, what about
this one ?
Uh, no. Let's keep going.
But what I do find sad
and what I do
find pathetic...
is people who don't
know themselves or people
who don't like themselves.
And as soon as they hear
that the world is ending,
they rush out and try and
hook up with someone, like it
was closing time at Studio 54.
Well, I guess I'm not
the one to talk to.
I mean, I know in my heart
that I'm not in a meaningful
relationship right now.
I'm not with
a woman that I love,
and I can deal with that.
I-- I just feel that now is
not the time to compromise.
There's something to be said
for human companionship.
This one ?
Uh, fine, fine.
Okay, stand back.
No, wait.
Oh,Jesus.
I can't drive
standard.
Oh, that's all right.
I don't like it much anyways.
I mean, cars are another
big disappointment.
They should have gone
farther than this.
They peaked both
aesthetically and technically
sometime around the mid-'70s,
'72, according to my friend,
and then basically no progress.
I mean, we deserve better.
I mean, even the little
things, you know.
Why do they always have
to be shiny ?
Why couldn't they make a car
with a nice matte finish ?
Well, there's something
to be said for
human companionship.
Oh, come on.
I like human beings
as much as the next guy.
Okay, this one, okay ?
This one ?
Yeah, all right.
Here we go.
Madam, your car.
[ Both Exhale ]
So now what ?
Now, we, uh, start it.
Well, I think I understand
where you're coming from.
It might make sense
in your mind, but
I can't really say I agree.
Meaning what ?
Take my life, for example:
how I met my husband.
I never knew him.
We met at a party when
the government closed down.
Three days later
we were married.
That was
like two months ago.
And I had been married
before, once before,
to a guy
from a bakery shop
where I used to work.
So I should have
known better.
But this marriage,
my current marriage,
is the best relationship
I've ever had.
I love him.
I feel like we've lived
a lifetime together.
So I guess I'm one of
those people you hate.
Oh, well,
I didn't mean it that way.
And another thing:
I'm pregnant.
You're going
to have his baby ?
I'm carrying it.
His embryo. My baby.
Do you think
that's immoral ?
Immoral ? Well, no.
None of us can
have children.
Actually, I think
it's kind ofsweet.
I wanted
to know if I could do it.
If I had the power.
And I do.
We could have done
anything together.
I love him, and we're
going to go all the way.
[ Horn Honks ]
Wh-What are you doing ?
Well, um, aren't
there some wires
under this thing...
ifyou break it off ?
You don't know
how to do this, do you ?
Well--
No. No,
I have no idea.
Taxi ! Taxi !
[ Horn Honks ]
[ Tires Squealing ]
[ Tires Screeching ]

[Tires Screech]
Patrick.
Patrick Wheeler.
Hey.
[ Laughs ]
What a treat
to see you today.
Uh, right. Menzies.
This is a friend of mine
from high school.
Yeah, absolutely.
The old orange and blue.
- Yeah, right.
Uh, is this your car ?
- [Menzies] You know, uh,
you're lucky
I ran into you today.
Yeah, maybe.
Because I have
two extra tickets...
for the concert tonight
that I would be honored
to give you.
Oh. Great.
So what concert's that ?
The thing downtown ?
You didn't hear ?
It's-- It's my concert.
I finally got my recital.
Tonight, 1 1 :00 sharp,
Petrolia Hall.
Really ? Well, that's
really prestigious.
We all knew you
had it in you.
We spent a whole day
driving around,
me and my cousin Ernie,
looking for a tux;
mine was ruined.
Showhim the tux,
Ernie.
Uh, finally found one
at Harry Rosen.
Harry Rosen,
ofall places.
Right. Okay, well,
that's the thing.
My friend here needs a lift.
Uh-huh.
Well, I-- I guess
we could drive her.
But it's
only three blocks.
Right, but she's going
across town.
Oh.
But ifyou're
finished with the car--
[ Chuckles ]
Patrick,
I-- I need it at least
until the show.
You know, Ernie might
have to run errands
or load equipment in.
You know
how concerts are.
Right.
I'd love to help you out
and your friend--
she looks like a movie star--
but I only have one car.
Right.
I'm not like
Craig Zwiller.
Well, good luck then.
Break a leg.
Oh, keep them.
In case you're
in the neighborhood.
[DoorOpens,

Patrick, I really
appreciate all your help.
Ah, listen.
My pleasure.
[Moaning]

[Buzzing Continues]
Uh, one second.

[Buzzing Continues]
- Yeah ? What is it ?
- Craig, it's me, Patrick.
I have
to askyou a favor.
What is it ? I'm busy.
Let me in.
It's important.
Everything
is important today.
Ten minutes.
[ Buzzing ]
S-So what is
all that stuffanyway ?
You have to drag it around ?
Oh, it's
just some stuff
we needed tonight.
Oh.
My husband
and I are going
to commit suicide.
We're going to kill
each other at midnight.
Oh.
So...
I guess you really
love him then.
Patrick Wheeler ?
Look at you.
Look like
you're waiting
for the principal.
Again.
Madame Carlton.
And what have you
been up to, Patrick ?
[ Speaking French ]
Oh. Um--
[ Speaking French ]
You mean myjob ?
Oui. Bravo.
[ French ]
None were actually built.
Oui, oui.
[ Continuing In French ]
[ French ]
It's the dream that counts.
It's nice that you
can still remember.
[ French ]
Browner.
Well, French was never
your forte, Craig.
[Patrick]
Au revoir, madame.
Adieu.
Adieu.
[ Pushes Button ]
Bon voyage.
[Craig]
Fuck off.
No.
You can't have it.
It's unfair to even ask.
It's not for me.
Allthe more reason.
It was my car first.
Right, and now it's mine.
I bought it.
It's been mine
for over two years.
It's part of my... thing.
Patrick, let's go.
We can't force him,
okay ?
Come on, man.
Do something good.
Fuck offwith that good shit.
Let's go.
I'll find another car.
It's fine.
What are you doing,
planning a road trip
or something ?
'Cause guess what ?
You don't have time.
I told you, it's not about that.
It's not about... utility.
Listen, I'm sorry.
It's important.
I'm sorry we
had to interrupt
your last day. Let's go.
You have two others.
[ Sighs ]
It's a collection.
They're antique cars.
Two old cars
is not a collection.
It's a guy with two old cars.
Mm-hmm.
Take it,
bastard.
I knew you'd give in.
I wanted to die
a man with three cars.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
He's obviously fucked.
Thanks a lot,
my dearest friend.
Um, so I'll walkyou
to the car ?
I'm sure
I can find it.
It's hard to miss.
A 1 970 lime green,
super ""B"",
overhead cams, duel exhaust.
It was one ofthe first--
Not that you'll need
to look under the hood.
Thankyou very much.
Thankyou.
You're welcome.
Thankyou.
Are you sure you're
gonna be all right ?
You don't need
any help ?
No. I'd better go.
Oh, no. Um, Patrick,
what are you doing
right now ?
Right now ?
Going home, I guess.
If my husband calls,
tell him I'm coming.
[Craig]
So,
not bad.
[Patrick]
Not bad, eh ?
Mrs. Carlton ?
No, l wasreferring
to what's-her-name.
Oh, Sandra.
Yeah, not bad.
Come on.
Don't be modest.
No-- No, I barely know her.
Ha ! Even better,
you dog.
No, she's a stranger.
I helped her find a car.
And that's it ?
What's the matter with you ?
I saw the way
she was looking.
Women these days are,
uh, ripe for the picking.
Well, I don't think
that was an option here.
Mm. Are you kidding me ?
They all wanna go out
with a... bang.
Patrick, when was the last
time you got... some ?
[ Groaning ]
[ Scoffs ]
For one brief moment,
I thought you had actually
forgotten your, uh, tragedy...
look, l'm not complaining.
You don't have to--
and realized that
what is one death
compared to the fact...
that in under two hours
every living soul on Earth
is gonna evaporate.
Yeah, well, lrealize that.
ltjust doesn 't turn me on.
You know ?
lfKaren were here,
she'd wantyou to be
with otherpeople, right ?
If Karen was here ?
No, I don't think so.
But she liked people.
You know what I mean ?
She worked
in a kindergarten,
for fuck sake.
Vitamins.
Well, listen,
I appreciate
your concern, but--
It's a question
of perspective.
Living while you can.
And, baby,
it's not too late.
I mean, most people
are probably taken by now.
But if I were you,
I would get on the blower.
Get on the internet.
I mean, that's
what it's there for.
That's why they invented it.
Come here.
I'll show you something.
One thing that this
has proved to me:
You have to take life
in your own hands.
You have to fulfill
yourown destiny.
l'm sure there's things,
Patrick, thatyou feel
rippedoffabout.
Sure, lguess,
but l'mprettymuch
overit now.
Take a look at this.
I tried to ask myself,
""What did I want ?""
What were those experiences
that I had hoped for...
which were now
just passing me by ?
And I made a list.
I made a comprehensive list.
Andthen l went out
andlactivelytried
to meet thosegoals.
And as you can see,
it wasn't that hard.
""Anal sex.""
[ Chuckling ]
Can you believe it ?
I'd never given it
to a woman up the ass before.
You know ? I'm not afraid
to say it now. It's way
past modesty at this point.
""Redhead.""
""Black. Chinese.""
""Blind."" Uh-huh.
""Sex outdoors.""
""Sex with a virgin.""
See, it's split
into different categories:
types oflocation,
types ofact,
type ofwoman.
What about bestiality ?
You done that yet ?
Not on the list. It's
just things I wanted to do,
notjust every perversion.
""Coercive sex.""
Um--
Within limits.
""Menage a trois.""
Oui.
Like-- These are things
I really believed in.
Uh, I had to look
in my heart.
Some ofthese things
were hard to achieve.
Some ofthese things
were hard to admit to.
But l'mproudofwhat
l've done. l'mproud
ofwhat l've accomplished.
And-- I mean, I'm not
going to my grave
with any regrets.
And, uh, all this
since yesterday morning ?
Oh, yeah.
[ Laughing ]
No. Two solid months.
And, uh, you know,
it's-- it's not overyet.
I wanna die
having a mutual orgasm.
Oh, well, I better
be going then.
See, that's
a pretty basic fantasy.
I mean, ifyou gotta go--
You might as well
be coming, right ?
Right. Hey, hey, hey, Patrick.
Look, I wasn't trying
to show off...
or trying to make you
feel inadequate.
I was showing you that
as a friend and a buddy.
I was actually trying
to inspire you.
Mm-hmm.
Thankyou.

[ Bell Dings ]
[Tires Screeching]
You gonna be okay
out there ?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
It'sjust a couple blocks.
Yeah.
Can you do me one favor
before you go ?
Sure.
Come in.
[Tires Screeching]
Uh, Patrick,
have a seat.
I was trying to give you
a hint up there by, uh,
showing you the list,
but I guess you don't, um,
read too well, right ?
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, forget it.
What ?
Man, you're stupid.
You wanna have sex ?
That was down
at the bottom ofthe list.
I mean, there were certain acts
that could only be done
with other men.
That-That necessarily
wouldn't include anal sex,
'cause I already
did that, but--
You know,
there are other things.
Right, right, I understand.
Patrick, I like you.
I mean, I always have.
I like you too.
To be perfectly honest,
I never thought ofyou that way.
I mean--
But that idea ofsex...
with other men, you know,
it crossed my mind,
as it has done
with most of us, probably.
Ofcourse.
So...
here's-here's our chance.
I mean,
you could do worse.
Well, uh, I thought
you had a date.
I do.
So, we don't have
much time.
It's not gonna take
that long.
[ Chuckles ]
Come on.
You've already done this
I don't know
how many times today.
It's gonna take some time.
Look, are you being
judgmental ?
No, no, I'm not.
There's nojudgement here.
I don't have time for that.
No, I'm not.
I'm puttin' myself
on the line here.
And I'm flattered.
I'm moved by it.
Don't fuckin' condescend to me.
I'm--
I would do it...
ifyou asked me any
other time, I swear, if--
I always thought
I should, you know ?
Ifyou'd given me some time
to prepare, psychologically,
and some time after.
A couple months.
I knew it.
You're a wuss.
It's nothing personal.
It has nothing
to do with you.
I would say the same thing
to a woman.
It'sjust sex.
Today, I just
don't want to risk...
having bad sex today.
I just don't want that
to be the last thing
on my mind.
And you think
l'm fucked ?
But I love you.
And I love you, pal.
Okay.
[ Chuckling ]
Okay.
Okay.
Mercy-fuckyour skinny ass ?
What was I thinking ?
In your dreams, pal.
Get the fuck on home.
Oh, uh, I forgot to mention
I saw Menziesjust around
the corner.
I'm sure he'd be game.
Oh, really ?
Fuck off.
Okay, I will.
See ya.
No, you won't.
Good luck...

Yes, you can stay.
You can spend the night

It's past 1 1 :00, and anyway
I want you to stay.
I've been thinking about it,
and it's not an imposition.
It's not like I wanna

I wonder how they're doing.
When did they think
they were gonna watch
all ofthis ?
Barbecues,

foreign food...
and traveling.
I like to travel.
I've been to every continent,
except South America.
So, how wasAntarctica ?
And Antarctica.
But even there,
I wish I'd seen it too.
Ice cream.
I guess it's pretty obvious.
No, no, it counts.
I could use some right now.
Strawberry ice cream,
straight out ofthe package.
Sorry.
I can't help you.
So, do you feel
like you know me ?
Better than anyone.
How about you ?
Me. Okay.
Uh, well, I was born
here in Toronto...
and, uh, lived here
all my life.
In North York,
actually.
And my father was
a stockbroker--
Okay, you better hurry up.
Tell me something
to make me love you.
Oh.
Uh, okay.
Uh--
Tell me your big tragedy.
What tragedy ?
About the girl you loved
who ran away or died.
She died.
It's pretty obvious.
Well, people die all over.
You have to put it
into perspective.
Soon we all will.
Well, it's hard--
It's hard for me to
explain this. You'd
have to meet my family.
But, um--
Well, she taught me
how I could love.
How much.
Which is a lot, actually.
It's-It's surprising.
You'd never believe it,
someone like me, but, um--
This is embarrassing,
actually.
It's embarrassing for me
to tell you this,
and to tell her,
but, um--
she-she died,
and then they said
the world would end.
I'm sorry.
She was sick.
Remember when people
got sick...
and died
one at a time ?
It's not your fault.
That she died ?
I know.
That the world is ending.
Yeah, that too.
I know.
I'm not that arrogant.
Tell me more.
I want to love you.
It won't be hard.
[ Sighs ]
Yeah, well,
that's about it.
That's my big story.
It usually does the trick.
Okay, um,
tell me all the details.
All right.

No, it'sharder

ofthose little ones--

ldon't give a damn.

""the children.""
""Pity the children.""
I'm tired
ofthe children.
They haven't lived,
given birth,
watched their friends die.
I have invested 80 years
in this life.
The children don't know
what they're missing.
Good point.
Well--
Uh, we should get ready.
Ready.

No. Um--
