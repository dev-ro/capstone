Good evening.
Thank you very much.
Follow me.
Here on the sixth row.
Two seats over there.
Enjoy the evening.
Good evening. Tickets?
Thank you very much.
You can go to my
colleague, she will help you.
Good evening.
Can I see your tickets?
Thank you very much.
Pardon me,
there must have been a mistake.
These are our seats.
Here, let me show you.
Pay attention.
It's the wrong seat.
I'm so sorry.
Excuse us.
- Come.
- Yes.
No, please. I wanna stay!
Are you kidding?
I have to see him.
What is so special
about that Mengelen?
Mengelberg.
That's what I said. Come on.
This is the men's room.
I'm uh... I'm....
I'm checking things.
What are you checking?
The hygiene. The men's rooms
get dirty faster.
That's why we have to do
an extra check.
And are you done with that?
Everything is clean, sir...
You'll miss the concert.
I've seen it a few times before.
You forgot something.
Shouldn't you do something?
We need to get her out.
What? Who?
She works for you?
You don't have to push
me, I can walk on my own.
People like you
should be locked up.
Can't I apologize?
To whom? The entire room?
To Maestro Mengelberg.
You think I'll let you near him?
A great musician
should be treated with respect!
You're fired.
You're not my boss!
THE CONDUCTOR
BASED ON A TRUE STORY
Rough day?
- It was okay.
- Willy...
Your wages.
I get paid next week.
- Ridiculous.
- They had a party.
Can you cut the onions?
I'm making soup.
You know they make her cry.
A few tears won't kill her.
Let's go. Mom feels
a migraine coming on.
Mister Goldsmith?
Sir?
My parents and I...
We visited your lunch concerts
for years.
Because they're free, no doubt.
At that last bit...
The trombones
played the wrong note,
just before the repeat
of the trio.
They played an E natural
but it should have been
an E-flat.
Wait!
Well observed.
Do you know the
part of the trombones by heart?
Not only that part, every note.
You teach the piano
at the conservatory?
I do.
- I'd like to go there.
- Good luck with that.
I want you to give me a chance
to play for you.
- I don't want to waste my time.
- Me neither.
Tomorrow afternoon then, 4 p.m.
Yes?
I have an appointment
with Mr. Goldsmith.
Come in.
Could I get a cup of coffee,
please?
Be quiet! I'm trying to work!
The coffee
beans need to be ground.
She can do that.
You can come in
when you have coffee.
You heard him.
Stop running.
This household
is in a state of complete chaos.
Don't mind him,
he is part of the furniture...
Frank, this is-eh...
What's your name?
Willy Wolters.
Let's not waste time.
Play.
You can stop now.
- Beautiful.
- You think so?
This grand piano...
I practice on a piano
with rags damping the strings.
Why in God's name
would you do that?
Because otherwise
the neighbors would complain.
But it's an old thing.
My dad found it
dumped with the garbage.
- Garbage?
- My dad is a garbage man.
Who taught you?
A friend of my mother's.
What do you know about Bach?
I play his notes, sir.
You can't play the notes
if you haven't studied the man.
Do you know who's the world's
greatest Bach authority?
Of course she doesn't know.
Albert Schweitzer.
He studied Bach,
turned him inside out
as was never done before.
Unfortunately
he gave up his brilliant career
to become a doctor
in the African jungle.
Which confirms my theory
that genius all too often
borders on insanity.
- So you think he's insane?
- Yes.
He abuses his talent
by not using it.
Perhaps he has more talent
to be a doctor.
Why do you play like that?
Like what?
Like you have no feelings.
Because I've learned
that nobody's interested
in my feelings.
Shouldn't you interpret
what's behind the music?
Interpretations can be wrong.
The notes are never wrong.
That's science.
Bach was
a mathematical composer.
One of few
who spoke the language of God.
Well... Nobody knows
what God intended, do they?
Your technique is awful.
The way you
stomp the sustain pedal,
you hardly conceal it.
Forget about the conservatory.
Your chances
of getting accepted are nil.
But can't you teach me?
I will study hard,
I'll do anything to get better.
Allow me to give you
one piece of advice:
Get married and have children.
Like your wife.
Yes.
I hope you enjoyed your coffee.
Peculiar woman.
A rather attractive one.
Wait!
I can prepare you for the entrance exam!
I'd be insane
wanting that, wouldn't I?
Three lessons a
week, two dollars an hour?
Well? What do you say?
You have 10 minutes.
You. Too slow, nails too long,
too many mistakes.
And you... Quick fingers,
short nails, no mistakes.
You can start tomorrow.
Really? Thank you!
Hi. I'm here for the...
cloakroom job.
That's already taken.
You wouldn't have
gotten the job anyway.
Why not?
We work for tips. That's why.
Turned down?
Fifth time today.
To make it in this business,
you gotta stand out.
I will be in big trouble if
I don't find anything.
I'd love to help you out
but we're not hiring right now.
Except a piano player.
You're too restrained.
Move over.
Just let yourself go.
Why are you looking
for a pianist
if you can play yourself?
Because I'd rather
play the bass.
Robin, you have a cigarette?
Does that bother you?
People come from
all over just to see her.
Him.
Look at it like this:
We're all born naked,
the rest is just a disguise.
Welcome to the stage,
our fabulous
female impersonator,
the famous Miss Denise.
Thank you.
Look what we have here.
A female impostor at the piano.
Are you trying to impress me?
Or...
are you a real woman?
Hard to tell, isn't it?
Someone
is risking his neck for you.
Because as we can all see:
this is an all-man band.
Tell me: what is your name?
Willy.
So, because you don't have
a 'willy',
your parents named you Willy.
Okay boys,
let's see what she's got.
♪ I've had sweeties
by the score ♪
♪ Raved a lot of times before ♪
♪ But of all the ones
you've heard ♪
♪ This one
is the real last word ♪
♪ I fell, and how ♪
♪ Can't stop me now ♪
♪ She's got that,
she's got this ♪
♪ Can she hug, can she kiss? ♪
♪ Oh boy, what a girl ♪
♪ Want's me here,
want's me there ♪
♪ Want's me near, everywhere ♪
♪ Oh boy, what a girl ♪
♪ Oh gee,
other girls are far behind her ♪
♪ Oh gosh, hope nobody else
will find her! ♪
♪ Not too slow, not too fast ♪
♪ Just the kind that will last ♪
♪ Oh boy, what a girl ♪
You can join me
for a weekend trip.
It's a little too much
for my wife right now.
My audition is next week, sir.
It's an interesting
social circle.
I'm sure there'll be plenty of
prominent musicians there.
Where are you going this early?
- To work.
- Carrying a suitcase?
I won't be home tonight.
I'm staying over at Marjorie's.
- Who?
- You know, from work.
You look very nice today.
Thank you.
Hello Mark,
we just received
a telephone call from your wife.
She is in labor.
I guess that means I can't stay.
- The driver can take you back.
- I'll come with you.
No, no, no, please, stay.
You're here now.
Whom do I have the pleasure?
This is Willy Wolters,
she's a student of mine.
Nice to meet you Mrs.-
Thomsen.
And this is Mr. Thomsen.
- Hello, Willy.
- Hello.
The servant can show you
your room. You can...
freshen up.
Where are you going?
The other way.
The stairs are over here.
Oh.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
Same as you, I think.
This is my parents' house.
I grew up here.
And I'm a guest
of Mr. Goldsmith.
He didn't tell
me you were coming.
I'm not responsible for what
he does or does not tell you.
As long as you don't force
yourself upon the musicians here.
That's the last thing I'd do.
We all know
what you're capable of.
Now that you've made it clear
that you're a gentleman,
can you try to act like one?
Can someone bring me
to the station?
But the table
has already been set.
Nobody will miss me.
But I will, my dear.
Because you are
my dinner companion.
So you'd better go up
and get changed.
We've been
waiting for you. Please.
Excuse me.
You look familiar.
Have we met before?
Her name is Willy...
Maybe you can tell
us something about yourself, Willy.
There's not much to tell, madam.
Aren't you the girl
that sat down in the front
at my concert?
Yes, that was me.
You?
We don't need
to talk about that.
I assume you wanted to sit
in the first row
but had no money
to buy a ticket.
The staff isn't allowed to sit
in the hall during concerts.
You work there?
Well, not anymore...
I've left there.
I detect a slight accent.
Where are you from, originally?
From Holland, sir.
Ah, a compatriot.
Frank, don't you always say:
all that's good
comes from the Netherlands?
Why did you
read along with the score?
Well, I uh...
Is it a secret?
Well?
I want to become a conductor.
What did she say?
She wants to be a conductor.
Well, I know a lot
about the world of music,
but I have never heard
of a female conductor.
Have you ever met one?
I must admit
to the best of my knowledge,
there aren't any.
But women
can be just as good as men.
Perhaps she's right.
My wife was a very able singer,
before we got married.
Yes, but a conductor...?
How on earth
are you going to succeed?
I thought America
was the land of opportunity.
Not for everybody.
Are you admiring the stars
in the sky?
No, just the flowers at my feet.
Thanks for not telling that I...
Well, you know.
It's alright.
- Did you find a new job?
- Yes.
Where?
Something in music.
Yeah, but where?
It's enough
to be laughed at once.
I'm sorry. That was rude.
Shall we dance?
Home already?
Yes.
How was work?
- Good.
- What did they play?
Beethoven's 5th.
What we call 'Fate'.
Fate?
It was Tchaikovsky.
That pathetic piece.
I forgot.
That you got fired?
- How do you know?
- Easy.
I dropped by your work.
And...
What's this?
- How did you get this, with no job?
- You searched my room?
Every day, you pretend to go to work.
You're home late.
- What do you do all that time?
- I work.
- Where?
- I can't say.
- I have to know.
- But I won't tell you.
- How long is this going on?
- What?
Entrance exam, for the conservatory?
Mom, can we discuss this later?
I'm tired.
You lied all this time?
- I don't lie.
- You do.
About getting fired, studies, work.
I'm an adult, mom.
I need to live my own life.
Without us you wouldn't have a life.
I've added it all up.
What you eat, drink and wear.
Every piano lesson.
Here...
That's what I spent on you.
And what do I get in return?
Nothing but lies.
So I'm keeping this money.
To compensate for our costs.
- Forget about that conservatory.
- Mom...
Don't call me mom.
I'm not you mother.
What?
Mom?
Is it true?
I'm sorry, Willy.
We couldn't have children.
Then we saw this.
'Child for adoption. Young mother
wishes to give up daughter.'
'The best bid
will be accepted.'
I'm simply being offered for sale.
- How old was I?
- Two.
Why didn't she want me?
I'm afraid she didn't love you.
- And my father?
- We know nothing about him.
Your mother wasn't married.
Didn't she have any family?
They disowned her.
This is your birth certificate.
Agnes. My name is Agnes?
No, that's your mother's name.
Your name is Antonia.
Antonia Brico.
I'll go comfort her.
Tell her a few tears won't kill her.
Shut up!
Hey, turn it down!
Stop it!
Mom wants you to stop.
Quiet!
Hi.
- Mr. Goldsmith is inside.
- How did it go?
- I got accepted.
- Congratulations.
Can I give you a ride?
Where are you going?
Home. I can just take a bus-
- It's just a ride.
- it's not that far.
You'll be rid of me in no time.
We didn't say goodbye properly,
and as you said:
I should try
to act like a gentleman.
Somebody is moving out.
This is it.
Your parents will be proud.
I'm gonna be away
for a few weeks.
Preparing a tour.
When I return...
Can I see you again?
Now you know where to find me.
- Where's my piano?
- In the stove, so I can cook.
- Onion soup.
- You're insane.
Can I spend the night here?
That piano gave me comfort.
Without it
I would have lost my mind.
- We all lose our mind sometimes.
- You too?
Even I.
Don't despair.
Just dust yourself off
and start over again.
What does a man know
about dusting?
More than you, Scrubby Dutch.
Come, I'll show you around.
This is my bedroom.
But no one needs to be here
except me, so I keep it locked.
I have my own bathroom,
but you can use this one.
And this is where you'll sleep
I don't know how to thank you.
Of course I'll pay you.
Don't worry about that.
Robin?
Is keeping quiet about something
the same as lying?
Are you waiting for me?
We have to fill in for a band
that cancelled.
- Where are you playing?
- Here.
What? No!
I don't want to be recognized
by my classmates!
There won't be many around:
it's a party for investors.
Willy? How are you?
Couldn't be better.
Are you invited too?
Hello Mrs. Thomsen.
Willy, this is Emma.
We know Emma
since she was a child.
We're good friends
with her parents.
We secretly hope she and Frank
will become engaged one day.
Well,
we know nothing about that.
- I'll go ahead.
- Of course dear, right you are.
It's really good to see you.
Come join us inside.
I was uh, looking for Robin.
Robin? Who's Robin? A friend?
Sort of.
You can't leave without
saying hello to my father.
It would break his heart.
Willy! Oh, hello,
how are you?
Good.
We were talking
about how musical talent
can reveal itself
at a very young age.
Does that apply to you too?
I was five.
I walked past a church
and I heard the organ-
The Rothschilds are here!
How interesting!
I had never heard such a thing,
I never went to church before.
People were listening
from on the street.
Did you hear about the amount of
money the Rothschilds donated?
I sneaked inside
and climbed the stairs.
There I saw the organ player.
I had no idea who he was, but...
I was mesmerized,
I couldn't stop looking at him.
More than 5000 dollars.
It wasn't until later that I
heard it was Albert Schweitzer...
From that moment I started
to beg for a piano.
Schweitzer has never visited
the United States.
We lived in Holland...
He played Bach.
Are your parents musical?
Ugh, no...
But they're not my real parents.
I was adopted by them.
Did, did your parents die?
No, nobody knows anything
about my father.
And all I know about my mother
is that she sold me.
The people who raised me,
bought me.
Well, I mean... adopted me.
I should try to figure out
how much
they actually paid for me.
So you actually have
a different name?
Yes.
What is it?
Well, that doesn't matter.
It all happened without
my consent. I was two.
Interesting enough for you?
I thought so.
I made it all up.
I have to go.
Do you have to embarrass
my mother?
Excuse me?
Why are you so touchy?
I get touchy when people
treat me like wallpaper.
I don't get you, Willy.
Why don't you look
for better company?
Did you have an argument
with him?
I asked how to get to the stage.
Do you know who he is?
- Yes, his name is Frank.
- Frank Thomsen.
One of the most important
concert managers.
As long as he leaves me alone.
Done.
Are you afraid of me?
Oh no, sir.
I feel like we've known
each other for years.
Well, I have the feeling that
you admire me very much.
Am I right, Willy?
Well, I admire you
because
I want to be what you are.
What? Teacher?
No... conductor.
You're only saying that
because you are in love with me.
I say it because
I want to be a conductor.
That's impossible.
Women don't become conductors.
They can't do it.
Why not?
They can't lead.
But you could teach me.
A woman
with a baton in her hand?
Making extravagant movements
to a bunch of men?
I hardly find that becoming.
Who cares what I look like?
I do.
I want you to look pretty.
Is it because
you want to be in control?
Control? No.
I'd rather lose myself in music.
And I'd rather lose myself
in you.
Just remember:
women go on the bottom.
That gets them
where they need to go.
Please...
Please. Stop it!
Stop... Stop!
You broke it(!)
Get out!
He claims that you, and I quote:
'Attacked me hysterically
after I criticized her piano pl.
Hysterically.
That's what it says.
So it's his word against mine?
I guess so.
There are no witnesses...
He says he'll drop this if you
agree to leave the school.
Where do I sign?
What is your name, sweetheart?
Willy...
Brico.
Antonia Brico.
BIRTH CERTIFICATE
Here.
A new life
should come with new music.
- Willy Wolters?
- One floor up.
- Mrs. Wolters?
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Willy.
- She doesn't live here anymore.
Do you know where she is?
I can't find her anywhere.
Well, if you can't find her,
she doesn't want to be found.
Come on Robin.
Don't be a sissy.
Defend yourself.
Spoilsport.
Don't you know
Robin once had an accident?
No, I didn't know.
He's had a bad back ever since.
He wears a corset...
Just like me. Never seen it?
I forgot how secretive you are
about that.
Robin?
Robin?
Robin?
What are you doing in here?
It's a letter from the embassy.
Bad news?
They found her.
Isn't that what you wanted?
She's dead.
Now all I can do
is visit her grave...
Does it hurt?
Every day.

You have any idea how long
I've been looking for you?
You vanished of the earth,
without a message, nothing.
And now you run off again.
During intermissions
we go to the dressing rooms.
You can't push people away
as if nobody cares.
Why aren't you going
to the conservatory?
- You should ask Goldsmith.
- You think I didn't?
And what did he tell you?
I've finally found you,
that's what matters...
How are you?
I'm okay.
I'm going on a journey soon.
- Where to?
- To Holland.
- When?
- In a week.
- You can't go.
- Why not?
Because
I can't miss you anymore.
- Antonia, we need to start.
- I'm on my way.
- Antonia?
- That's my name.
So that whole adoption story
was true?
Yes, Frank, I'm a bastard.
Stop!
Why are you doing this?
Antonia...
I don't want to say goodbye.
I want to be with you.
So do I.
Forget about that trip and stay.
CONCERT HALL
PIANO TUNER WANTED
My dearest Frank,
I'm staying in a lovely hotel,
in a room with a beautiful vie.
Don't be scared,
you won't lose me to music.
There's no music to listen to
and I can't afford
to go to a concert.
I don't mind. Now I have you.
I love Amsterdam.
I examine every street
and every alley.
What am I looking for?
I don't know.
I don't know anyone here.
In the meantime
I try to gather some courage
to find out more
about my family.
Who is this lady?
You know her... Willy?
Has she taken on a stage name?
Mr. Mengelberg?
Antonia Brico.
Do you recognize me?
- How could I possibly forget you?
- I was hoping you'd say that.
I'd like to ask you a favor.
Can you give me conducting lessons?
Conducting lessons?
I understand you're busy.
But I don't know where to start.
I figured, you know Frank Thomsen...
...and me being his friend,
I was hoping...
Can I think about it?
Yes, of course.
A telegram, sir.
Miss Brico asked for
lessons in conducting.
What should I do?
Willem Mengelberg.
Make sure this gets sent
as quickly as possible.
HERE RESTS AGNES BRICO
Who takes such good care of it?
Sister Louigiana,
your mother's sister.
Is she here? Can I talk to her?
You can't. She took a vow of silence.
- Sure, but can I see her?
- No.
Can I talk to your boss?
- Mother superior?
- Yes, that's who I meant.
Ten minutes, in absolute silence.
- Agnes.
- Dear God, forgive her.
I'm her daughter. Antonia.
Where were you?
In America.
You were untraceable.
Did she try to find me?
Do you know how my parents met?
I respect your vow of silence,
but you've already broken it.
Why did she get rid of me?
That's what I'd like to know.
Perhaps you can ask God
if someone can answer my questions.
Keeping quiet is the same as lying.
She never wanted to give you up.
Do you know what she said,
just before she died?
'For God's sake, find Antonia'
- Why are you here?
- Did you give it some thought?
Go home.
- I have no home.
- To America.
You don't understand.
I can't give up.
I'd rather die trying
than not try at all.
And if you fail?
Then I'll go home.
Meet me at my office tomorrow.
BERLIN
My name is Antonia.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Antonia.
What do you want?
My name is Antonia Brico.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm here to see Mr. Muck.
Where are you from?
- I'm from America.
- Herr Muck is not home.
Besides, he's not to be
disturbed before noon.
Elze?
- What is this?
- Well...
Who are you?
She is from U.S.A.
I'm not home for Americans.
I'm Dutch by birth. I still am,
because I never naturalized.
I brought a letter
of recommendation.
From Maestro Mengelberg?
A letter of recommendation...
What does
that son of a bitch want?
If he calls this a recommendati,
I'll eat my cigarette.
I want to become a conductor.
I'm prejudiced
when it comes to women.
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Who?
Albert Schweitzer.
We have a few things in common.
During the Great War, Schweitzer
was imprisoned in France.
And not because
he hurt or threatened anyone,
but simply because
he was German.
And you judge me,
not because
I did anything wrong,
but because I'm American.
Or Dutch, or female,
or young, or a nonsmoker?
That's what I call
short sighted.
So I am short sighted.
In his book about Bach,
he writes that
a characteristic of artists
is that they wait
for their big day
and that they exhaust themselves
whilst waiting for it.
That's about me.
And have you
dropped dead already?
Not yet.
Schweitzer was crazy enough
to give up his music
for another life.
I'm crazy enough
to give up mine for music.
With or without your help, sir,
I will become a conductor.
So...
You're ready to
exhaust yourself, you say?
Dear Robin,
after some wanderings
I have now settled in Berlin.
I'm being taught by Karl Muck.
Of course
that doesn't tell you much,
but to me he is fantastic.
I'm finally learning
what it's all about.
And unlike Mengelberg,
Muck gives me a fair chance.
He has prepared me
or my entrance exam
at the State Academy for Music.
This is where
I really have to prove myself.
Because for conducting they
accept only two candidates...
And they have never
accepted a woman.
Hi.
Hello Frank, how are you?
You heard anything
from Antonia lately?
She doesn't write you?
No... she hasn't.
Not in a while.
Do you have any idea
when she'll be back?
- She wrote me from Berlin.
- Berlin?
She wants to enter
the Master School of Conducting.
- How long is the course?
- Two years.
Two years? Where is she
going to find the money?
Is that the first thing
you think about?
They'll never accept her.
You underestimate her.
They already did.
To Dutch courage.
One woman
facing one hundred men.
What will you do
to make them follow your lead?
Will it take the soft approach
or the hard approach?
And one thing, Brico:
You can't do it when you sweat.
The crescendo goes from
pianissimo to forte...
...and you do mezzo forte.
And it wasn't even.
Good, you have to be a tyrant
with the baton. Not a democrat.
Is there somewhere we can talk?
The soup of the day...
Onion soup.
And schnitzel.
Enjoy your meal.
I'm really proud
you got accepted.
Are you?
Well. You could have sent me
a letter and told me.
I have a recommendation
written by Mengelberg.
I framed it,
hung it above my bed.
It's addressed to Muck, who
hates both America and women.
Do you know what he wrote?
That all that's good
comes from Holland,
except me.
I don't have to be a genius
to figure out
who was behind that.
Of course I was hoping
you'd come back.
I still do, actually.
I love you.
You only think you do.
How do you know
what I'm feeling?
I'm not suitable.
Look at your parents,
then look at mine.
I don't care. I want you.
I want to get married,
have children.
You'll find someone.
Are you telling me
you don't love me?
Is it good?
Yeah... lovely.
I thought
you didn't like onions...
Antonia, I need to know
so I'd like to hear yes or no.
And if the answer is yes,
I will wait for you.
Will you marry me?
Can I think about it?
Surely you know what to choose?
Well...
What hurts the least, and-
You're going to say no.
This world
will never let you go.
Mengelberg's wife
was a fantastic singer.
What's that got to do with it?
She doesn't sing anymore.
Miss Brico.
Always the first.
Miss Brico, always the last.
The greatest challenge in art
lies in dealing
with disappointments.
BANK OF GERMANY
You can tell me
it's from the U.S.,
but you can't tell me
who it's from?
As I said:
I'm not at liberty to say.
It must be from Frank Thomsen.
Perhaps his father, Mr. Thomsen?
All I can say it's from a woman
who supports the arts.
A woman supporting the arts?
BERLIN
Here. The first woman to
conduct the Berlin Philharmonic.
That should have been you.
Not some missy from Vienna.
That 'missy'
wants the same thing as me.
The Berliner Philharmoniker
have no faith in her.
Her husband had to advance
5000 Deutsch Mark
for the orchestra
and concert hall.
So if nobody comes he'll
suffer a considderable loss.
Mark my words:
that's your future.
So, you wanna go there?
Here, I can give them away.
They don't want
an empty room.
No...
My dearest Frank.
I write you because I have head
you are engaged.
It was wrong of me to
drive you away and I beg you:
please give me another chance
and don't marry.
Worthless.
Get off the stage.
My God,
they're slaughtering her.
They just want their money back.
Was she that bad?
Mediocre at best.
They want their money back
because they were
lured into the concert
by a fake personal ad:
'Rich widow looking for a man.'
Made up by Frau Mayer.
You're next.
You're up for it?
For heaven's sake,
what are you doing?
I have to fix you a dress.
- Sorry.
- Can't you see I'm working?
Have you seen it?
WOMAN UNSUITABLE
TO LEAD PHILHARMONIKER
People want to see you fail.
But the good news is:
the concert
is completely sold out.
My dearest Frank.
I don't know
what's come over me.
I love you and I miss you.
When I finish school
I'll return to America.
Why won't you write back?
Mr. Muck,
Miss Brico is not here.
- Please sir, wait.
- Where is her room?
Now what?
Are you a little girl again?
Ready to run away and hide
under your mother's skirt?
Which mother?
You tell me...
Well, are you coming?
They're waiting for you.
Nobody waits for me.
This is your big day.
To be booed.
Or cheered.
All I can see is an abyss.
That will always be there,
even when you're successful.
The higher the rise,
the deeper the fall.
So I'll crash no matter what.
It's part of the game.
You just need to learn
to play it.
That's easy for you to say.
Your name is not Mayer,
or Brico. You are a hero.
The last time
I performed in America,
I was escorted from the stage
by the police
under loud boos
from the audience.
Why?
Because I refused to play
the American anthem.
I said: I'm German,
it's not my national anthem.
And then they locked me up
for 18 months.
Just because it was war,
I was the enemy.
Just like Albert Schweitzer.
Did that make me a hero?
Nobody thought so.
Just me.
Sometimes that's enough.
You're sweating.
Not anymore.
Do you remember her?
Antonia Brico? Never met her.
She used to work for you
as an usherette. Willy Wolters.
Is that her?
She caused quite a stir
in Europe.
Wouldn't it be worth the trouble
to have her conduct here?
I visited my mother's grave.
I guess you didn't know she died.
From heartache over losing me.
She was only 29.
Who told you that?
Her sister, who takes care
of her grave.
She had seven siblings.
My mother was the oldest.
So there's more family?
I'm sure you know what
'to be disowned' means.
She met a man.
A musician.
My mother was madly in love with him.
They spent one night together.
Then he got tired of her.
Love ruined her.
Selfish women are condemned.
Wasn't it selfish to abduct me
to America?
- That mother of yours sued us.
- Because she wanted me back.
That purchase was meant
to be temporary.
On the day of the trial
she waited in the courtroom.
Hours passed, but you didn't show up.
She searched for months,
but she couldn't find me.
I had simply disappeared.
What happened to your mother?
She locked herself up in a convent.
Where she wasted away.
Do you still think she didn't love me?
Are you ready?
Your parents are here.
I'll be right there.
Put me through to the music
editor of the New York Times.
I can arrange
one concert for you...
but you have to buy
half of all tickets.
How much is that?
In advance.
Do you ask this of all
conductors who perform here?
Only big-name conductors perfor.
You're not one of them.
I did well in Europe.
If you think six concerts
in one year is doing well, yes.
I'm taking a huge risk.
I can't afford it.
Then I have to
withdraw my offer.
Will you go back to Europe?
If I make it happen,
will you give me more concerts?
- Are you setting the conditions?
- Please?
More concerts are very important
to me. Please?
Are you begging?
There she is!
Can we get a reaction?
Is it true that you
are going to be conducting here?
Yes, it's true...
And if people wanna buy a ticket
they can come to me.
I've missed this the most.
You don't know what seedy
basements I've played the past year.
Incognito, of course.
As Willy Wolters.
I survived there because of
what I've learned here.
Always happy to help.
Are you serious?
Antonia Brico?
Stop. The trombones
come in too early.
Now the bassoons
come in a fraction too soon.
If you absolutely insist
on starting at the wrong time,
then please
let the trombones come in first.
Sure, four tickets?
Mr. Barnes,
there's a run on my tickets.
If this continues I
will be sold out within the hour.
Can I get another concert?
What is it this time?
- You have something to say?
- The concert is tomorrow.
I wouldn't have to stop
if you'd do as I say. Again.
Why aren't you playing?
I won't take orders from a woman
who doesn't know her place.
I know my place very well.
It's right here.
Again.
I took away your instrument.
How does that feel?
Careful, that's a Stradivarius.
Oh, it's a Stradivarius!
So you care about this instrume?
Yeah.
- That makes us even.
- How's that?
This orchestra is my instrument.
Without its members
I am nowhere,
I can't play my instrument.
Do you know what a soloist says
when he skips
one day of piano practice?
One day without practice
only I can hear.
Two days without practice
and the orchestra will hear.
Three days
and the audience will hear.
Don't you think
the same applies to conducting?
Do you know how many
concerts I have on my calendar?
One.
After that
it's a big gaping hole.
Do you know how many
my male colleagues have?
It's four, sometimes five
a month, all year through.
Is that fair?
No.
It's like throwing a bread crust
to someone who's starving.
Applaud, my friend,
the comedy is over.
You can't just walk away.
We have an agreement!
My instrument.
Please, accept it.
Without its player
the instrument is worthless.
Does this mean
you'll be there tomorrow?
No.
I'm still waiting
to hear something from you.
Will you do
the concert tomorrow?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Please?
Please what?
Miss Brico, will you please do
the concert tomorrow?
Mister Barnes,
are you begging me?
Yes.
What about my condition?
You'll have a second concert.
Shall we go
to the Antonia Brico concert?
I can get tickets.
Aren't you curious how she is?
No, I don't want to see her.
When I close my eyes,
I can't tell
it's a woman conducting.
Unemployed musicians?
They want me
to conduct unemployed musicians?
That's how he wants
to get rid of me?
It's a government
support project
to keep musicians trained
for better times.
I don't get it.
We had such good press.
For Barnes
that's the root of the problem.
You're getting
too much attention.
But that's great.
I understand you feel screwed.
But look on the bright side:
You get paid,
and you get to conduct.
But what's the point
when nobody hears it?
I won't do it.
Am I too early?
Where are all the men?
The New Jersey Symphony
is auditioning.
So what are
you still doing here?
They're only hiring men.
Just the men, huh?
Robin, don't you always say that
if you wanna make it
in this business,
you have to stand out?
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.
'Wanted:
Conductor Antonia Brico'
'is looking for female musicians
to form
a women's symphony orchestra.'
'There are positions
for all musical instruments.'
Can I see that?
'According to Mark Goldsmith, '
'an eminent conductor
and pianist'
'a woman will never become'
'one of the world's
leading conductors.'
Miss Brico
will have to be content'
'with a place in the margins'
'before she'll trudge
into oblivion.'
Which of you
has read this article?
Then I want to thank you all
for coming anyway.
None of you were inferior.
Alright ladies,
you can come this way.
Can the bass player
stay for a minute?
Can I speak to her alone?
What's your name?
Roberta...
Jones.
Roberta Jones...
Robin, is that you
dressed as a woman?
With your wig,
your fake breasts,
your make up and everything,
like Miss Denise?
Is this one of your statements?
Your way of supporting me?
Robin?
I'm not dressed as a woman...
What?
These are real.
How come I've never seen them?
Because I'm good
at hiding things.
You never were in an accident?
Unless
you count being born a girl.
Did you want to be a man?
I wanted to be a musician.
When I go on stage,
I enter my home.
Just like you.
That's why I supported you
when you lived in Berlin.
Are you telling me
that money came from you?
From a woman
supporting the arts.
God...
Robin...
Then I have to thank you.
I am so sorry I had no idea.
About that.
About anything really.
The price may be too high,
Antonia, but...
at least we are doing it.
Yes.
At least we are.
I think I'd rather stay
who I was.
Who are you?
I'm me.
Hey, did Miss Brico
have anything to say?
She said:
'Music doesn't know sexes'.
Town Hall is available.
Good grief, Town Hall?
It's far too many seats.
How can we fill them?
I was thinking about
putting an ad in the paper
and inviting the upper class.
I don't know any. Do you?
Well, yes,
but do you have their addresses?
Mr. Goldsmith.
What do you think of Antonia's challenge?
Where do I start, gentleman?
She took up conducting because
she wasn't a talented pianist.
A calculated choice,
in my opinion.
Only because she had her mind
set on becoming famous.
There's no passion involved.
Why would Mr. Goldsmith
say that?
Does he feel threatened by me?
Aren't there
countless unemployed musicians?
Brico has been without work
for years.
But an unemployed musician
is unemployed for a reason.
We are in the middle
of a great depression.
We're out of a job
through lack of opportunity,
not lack of ability.
It's an abnormality.
What? Women?
It goes against
all musical tradition.
We have to serve the music,
not the dusty clichés.
Women dream all sorts of things.
Think they're best
in I don't know what.
It's down to them
when they fail.
There are no
women that play the trombone.
And you can write this down: Brico
will never find a female timpanist.
Willy Wolters(!).
If you want to embarrass
yourself on a stage,
you should go ahead.
But an entire
orchestra of women, that's the limit.
Let me guess,
you support Goldsmith.
Of course.
I am here
to discourage you in your plans,
so you won't make
a spectacle of yourself.
People love spectacles.
If I can give my audience one,
I will not fail to do so.
You sent invitations
to everybody in my circle.
I'll do everything I can
to discourage my friends
from coming to your concert.
You should do as you please,
but allow me to do the same.
Have a nice day.
How could they place
the ad there!
On the same page as
the car listings?
Who will look there!
Such a waste of money!
I think Mrs. Thomsen has
some contacts with the press.
Are there any reservations?
Uhm... Yeah.
- Is that all?
- Yeah.
So we'll play an empty room.
We'll have to cancel Town Hall.
I already tried,
they won't accept it.
We'll have to pay regardless.
Pay them with what?
Oh, what a disaster!
I think
we should just go ahead with it.
How will we pay our musicians?
They agreed to play for free.
For nothing?
Not everyone is against us.
Alright.
Well, then we can at least
give them an audience.
We give a free concert
and ask Town Hall
if we can postpone our payment.
No more publicity expenditures.
We'll only take free publicity.
A letter, from the first lady.
What?
To Miss Brico,
from Eleanor Roosevelt, it says.
Excuse me. Do you know
hoq much longer it will take?
It can take a while.
I have a radio interview and I've
been waiting for half an hour.
I am sorry, but nobody tells Mrs.
Roosevelt to hurry up.
- Hello.
- Mr. Goldsmith.
Miss Brico,
it was a pleasure to meet you...
The person that
told me about you hasn't exaggerated.
May I ask you who that was?
Sorry, he asked to
keep his name secret.
Then we should respect that.
That's what he said about you...
when they attacked you
in the papers:
'A great musician
should be treated with respect.'
He must think highly of you.
Because he's paying
for the concert hall.
And if I may give you
one piece of advice:
Do what you
feel in your heart to be right.
For you'll be criticized anyway.
The public would like
to know: are women musicians people?
And bear in mind that this
country has 17 million radios.
So 50 million pairs of ears
are listening.
Don't you think the orchestra
world is ready for a cultural change?
This has
nothing to do with culture.
It's merely a questionable form
of entertainment;
a desperate way
of getting some attention.
Let's be honest, would you
buy a ticket for her concert?
I wouldn't.
We would like
Miss Brico to respond,
so we invited her to join us,
but she hasn't arrived yet.
That's another
reason why it won't work:
women are always late.
Aren't you hindered
by an unexplainable distaste
for women as orchestral leaders?
I'm telling
what the audience thinks.
Miss Brico will never be
Maestra Brico?
No.
Miss Brico's first concert
is planned in the Town Hall,
which has 1500 seats.
Do you think she'll sell
that many tickets?
She's gotten cold feet.
The last that I heard:
The concert is free of charge.
She doesn't want
to earn some money?
It's a desperate measure,
as there is no sign of interest
at all.
Ah, I see Miss Brico arrived.
What is your comment?
We took that 'measure'
because of the crisis.
We want this concert to be
accessible for everybody,
including people
without money. So...
Let me take this opportunity
and tell people to come.
My apologies for being
late, I had an important meeting.
What could possibly
be more important
than the success
of your doomed project?
Years ago
I studied under Mr. Goldsmith.
Back then
he had already a peculiar view
on the position of women:
They should be on the bottom.
In fact, because of that
I learned to be on top.
For that I still...
Resent him?
No.
Thank him. Honestly.
My meeting earlier
was with our First Lady.
And nobody tells Mrs. Roosevelt
to hurry up.
Did your meeting have anything to do
with the Women's Symphony Orchestra?
It had everything
to do with that:
Our First Lady has just committed
herself to the orchestra.
And we are very honored
she wants to be patroness.
It shows that
even in the highest circles
there are signs of interest.
What can I do for you, madam?
I'm here to see Frank Thomsen.
- Who shall I say it is?
- An old friend.
You're too fast for me.
You...
Hello Frank.
I see you have a son?
Yes.
- What's your name?
- Will.
William.
Can you take him upstairs?
It's a nice kid.
Yes.
What brings you here?
- Do you want to come inside?
- No, don't go to any trouble.
I have to be off again.
I just came here to thank you.
- For what you've done.
- What would that be?
Mrs. Roosevelt? And Town Hall?
That was nothing.
Well, it is to me.
It took me a while to figure out
you have been
pulling some strings.
I owe you.
Just see it as my way of saying
I am sorry.
Sorry, for what?
For asking you to abuse
your talent by not using it.
Once you said that was insane.
You're not insane.
I was,
when I let you go.
That makes two of us.
Yeah, well,
I have to be of again.
I'll leave you to it.
Will you come to the concert?
No.
I have to stay at home.
With William.
Maybe Emma will come.
- How is it outside?
- One big spectacle.
Good evening Mme First Lady...
it's such an honour to meet you.
- It really is a privilege.
- Thank you.
You can't come in,
the hall is full.
Please stay out, we're full.
Hello sir.
People have no decency anymore.
I think that's Frank.
The New York Women's Symphony
performed 4 successful years.
When Antonia began
to accept male musicians...
the public's interest disappeared
and the orchestra ceased to exist.
Antonia devoted
her entire life to music...
and remained active as a guest
conductor for famous orchestras.
However, she never attained a
permanent position as chief conductor.
In 2008, the well-respected
magazine Gramophone...
published a ranking of the
20 best orchestras in the world.
None of these orchestras has
ever had a female chief conductor.
Gramophone published
another ranking in 2017...
now with the 50 greatest
conductors of all time.
0% are women.
