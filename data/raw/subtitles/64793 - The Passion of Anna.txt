DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2016
A FILM BY INGMAR BERGMAN
His name is Andreas Winkelman
and he is 48 years old.
For some time now, he has lived alone
in this house on an island out at sea.
The roof has long been in disrepair
and after the last autumn rain,
it started leaking in earnest.
Hi, Johan.
- Hi.
- How are you?
Fine, thanks.
How are the windpipes?
They're crap.
I have a bottle of cough syrup at home.
You can have it.
Thanks.
Come by one day.
Yes.
Then we could sit down and chat a bit too.
Sure.
I'm off to the post office
before they close.
But let's get together one day.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Hello?
- Good day.
- My name's Anna Fromm.
Winkelman.
I need to make an important call,
but our telephone is broken.
You can borrow mine.
- Please come in.
- Thank you very much.
- It's over there.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
Stockholm, 400979.
Can you call back
to say how much it costs?
Thanks.
Hi, Elis, it's Anna.
Sorry to bother you.
Before you come home tonight,
can you find out something for me?
Andreas deposited some money in Basel
when the boy was born.
I need that money now.
Yes.
Yes.
He never did?
Why not?
You were supposed to help him.
We've talked about that money.
I don't understand.
Elis, this is not an ordinary transaction
we're talking about.
This actually means something to me,
and it's not the money.
Elis?
Yes.
Yes.
I'll see you tonight.
I found out what the call cost.
Thank you, but there was no rush.
Come again.
You can use the telephone
whenever you want.
Interlude. Von Sydow. Take four.
Max, as an actor,
how do you personally perceive
Andreas Winkelman?
I think he's very difficult in a way,
because...
he has for so long tried to hide
from his surroundings.
His failed marriage and his legal troubles
have forced him into a corner,
where he's simply
trying to hide his identity.
And he's trying to destroy
his means of expression.
And his hiding place,
perhaps without him being aware of it,
has been transformed into his own prison.
The difficulty for me as an actor...
is to try and express
his lack of expression.
"Dearest Anna,
I can't live with you anymore.
I have denied that truth for a long time,
because I love you."
"I neither can nor want
to live with you any longer.
I don't believe in trying again,
since neither of us are willing to change.
But I don't want to give up,
because I know
we'll run into new complications,
which in turn will trigger
terrible emotional agitation,
physical and psychological violence."
I know we'll run into new...
complications,
which in turn will trigger
terrible emotional
agitation,
physical and psychological violence.
"Therefore, I ask you not to contact me.
Your Andreas."
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Can I see Mrs. Fromm?
- No. She has a cold. She's in bed.
I see. She borrowed my telephone
this afternoon and forgot her purse.
- I'll take care of it.
- Good day.
Good day.
Please come in
and have a cognac, it's chilly.
That's very kind of you,
but I have a few things to take care of.
- Please come again.
- Thank you.
Anytime.
There, there. There you go, little fella.
Come here, let's see.
There. Let's see if we can find
something good for you.
There you go.
Try a taste of this.
Try this. That tastes pretty good, huh?
Let's see what they've done to you,
little fella.
Forgive me. I was worried.
I came by and thought something
might have happened to you.
No need to apologize. I'm fine.
Sometimes I have difficulty
sleeping at nights,
so I fall asleep during the day.
I'm sorry I woke you. Good-bye then.
Good-bye for now.
This meeting resulted
in an invitation to dinner.
He accepts for unknown reasons
and dresses up in a white shirt,
dark suit and tie.
The mood is cheerful,
amiable and openhearted.
And he feels a sudden affection
for these people.
You all look so nice. Very fancy.
- It's for your sake.
- I'm actually not used to it.
I'm not a hermit, as Elis says,
quite the opposite.
I enjoy meeting new people,
but you run into the same neighbors.
- It's great to get to know you.
- I hope you don't get tired of us.
- No.
- You're welcome back whenever you want.
When I was little,
I thought God had a beard,
because I remember sitting in my dad's lap
reading a book called Light,
about how the world was created.
And He had...
There was a picture of God
hovering above Earth,
with His arms stretched out.
It wasn't wings,
but some type of flowing robe.
He was very close to the surface of Earth.
He was incredibly beautiful
with a big beard.
That made me believe in God,
even though my parents did not,
because I had seen Him in the book.
It sounds alive.
Do you believe in God now?
Do I believe in God, Elis?
Perhaps you don't believe
in the printed word anymore?
No, but I do believe in God. No.
If you had children,
would you have told them...
No, I wouldn't believe...
I wouldn't teach them to believe in God.
I don't know how I'd behave.
I don't think I could handle children.
- Yes, you could.
- No, it's difficult because... What?
Maybe you'd let the children decide
for themselves. Give them alternatives.
- Huh?
- Yes, I think so.
- Andreas?
- Yes?
When I go to Milan to realize their
proud dream of building a cultural center,
I think you should come visit.
It's a very interesting city.
It's huge and full of extremely ugly
and sordid and disgusting people.
- No! You can't say things like that.
- No, you're right.
But these people will now be offered
the opportunity for cultural activities,
and you must come down
and see how this becomes a reality.
A formidable monument for...
- Are you the right person to build this?
- ...cultural affectation.
- Certainly.
- Is it really a cultural building?
Certainly. Of course it is.
How can you despise your job like that?
How can you say that?
I don't despise it at all.
I think it's important that I'm active
so I can satisfy your needs,
especially the financial ones.
Elis, now you're cruel. He's so cruel.
Why did you take this job
if you despise it?
I think it's a lot of fun
designing buildings.
I'm a very distinguished architect.
I was very flattered by the offer.
There are a lot of reasons.
But, in all seriousness,
what does a cultural center actually mean?
It is a mausoleum
representing the total futility
in which our kind of people live.
Why are you joking about it then?
Why are you joking about it?
Why build a cultural center
that you don't believe in?
Why not do something you believe in,
which feels true to you?
I would have nothing to do.
How do you do it?
Nothing to do?
I try to do things I believe in.
I try to live with some form of truth.
But how do you know what is right?
People sense within themselves
what is true and what is right.
We fail sometimes,
but I think you should strive
for some form of spiritual perfection.
- Have you ever failed?
- Do you often fail?
I haven't failed in what has been
most important to me,
namely, to live
in a relationship with a man.
The man I was married to... Andreas.
Do you know why I didn't fail?
Because we lived in harmony
due to being truthful towards each other.
We were honest with each other.
We believed in each other.
If I had the same attitude
towards my marriage
as you do towards your culture center,
I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I wouldn't have wonderful memories,
happy memories.
I wouldn't have anything to believe in,
but now I do.
...complications,
which in turn will trigger
terrible emotional
agitation,
physical and psychological violence.
- It started to rain.
- It's really coming down.
- How are you getting home tonight?
- I have my raincoat.
- You can stay here. Can't he?
- Naturally.
- We have a nice guest room.
- It's settled.
Now we'll have coffee,
then you're staying,
and then we'll have breakfast
in the morning.
Cheers.
Do we want coffee?
Andreas!
Elis? Elis, are you there?
- Andreas!
- Anna's having a nightmare.
- Andreas!
- Hurry up!
Last year I received permission
to buy the land down to the sea.
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.
- We're completely at peace here.
- I can see that.
Andreas, did you hear something
last night?
I woke up briefly, but fell back asleep.
It was Anna.
She still has nightmares
from the accident.
- I understand.
- Shall we go to the mill?
Here's what it looks like. Come in.
In the beginning,
I collected all kinds of images,
those I had taken myself,
those I found in newspapers,
magazines, old photo albums, used books.
They're always about people.
For instance, in this box
you have all categories of people eating.
Incredible.
Here you have people sleeping,
people caught in violent emotions...
That's this entire section
with different subcategories.
At one time I only collected images
of violent acts.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
As you can see, I have categorized them
according to behavior.
A completely irrational categorization,
just as meaningless
as the act of collecting itself.
The row over there contains faces.
Close-ups.
I've taken them myself
and some are interesting.
I was going to ask
if I could take some of you.
Would you mind?
No, not at all. Quite the opposite.
No, I'm very flattered.
I have all the time in the world.
It's decided then.
Here it is.
Andreas, this might interest you.
Anna Fromm, 23 years old, happily married,
seven years before the catastrophe.
You don't have photos of her husband?
Yes, of course I do.
It would be interesting
to see what he looked like.
Here you go.
Here's your namesake.
What sort of person was he, this Andreas?
He was considered a scientific genius,
but he never got
the opportunity to prove it.
He was a peculiar blend
of kindness and ruthlessness.
- Would you like something to drink?
- Yes, please.
- Whiskey?
- Yes, please.
Maybe it's too early?
No, not today.
- Ice?
- No, thank you.
We were friends from school,
but I can't say I really knew him.
For Anna he was,
for obvious reasons, a disaster.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
She loved him almost to madness.
I've never seen anything like it.
I've possibly read about it in literature.
I assume he also loved her
in his own peculiar way.
I don't know. Cheers.
Cheers.
But I'm biased.
My wife was his lover for one year.
Well, I shouldn't complain.
It was perfectly open.
But one day she left him.
I still don't know the reason.
I haven't dared to ask.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
What was I going to say?
Yes, I was going to say...
I would like to say that Eva...
Eva has an extraordinary mental strength.
You wouldn't think so looking at her.
No, it never occurred to me.
Anna and her have been inseparable
for many years.
Yes, that's the way it is.
Now you know. Cheers.
Can anything be heard?
No, not a sound.
Not a damn thing.
Andreas.
Aren't you listening to what I'm saying?
Goddamn crap.
Andreas!
Listen, Winkelman. Winkelman, Winkelman.
Andreas!
Listen! Listen!
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Damn it. Damn it.
Andreas. Andreas!
What are you doing?
Get up! You can't sit here.
I'm going to kick you.
No, no, no.
Wait.
There.
Come.
Come sit down.
Take it easy.
I'll make some coffee for you.
That'll make it better.
Go to hell!
There.
There you go.
Interlude. Liv Ullmann. Take seven.
I sympathize with Anna's need for truth.
I understand her desire
that the world be a certain way.
But it turns out that her desire,
this wish for truth,
becomes dangerous for her,
because when she realizes
her surroundings don't fit,
that she's not getting
the response she demands,
she takes refuge in lies and imagination.
I think that's why it's so hard
to be honest.
You expect that others
will hold the same beliefs.
We see that today in thousands of people.
Hi.
Hi!
Hi.
I've been alone for three days now.
I'm terribly bored.
This morning I thought,
"I'll go visit Andreas."
- That was a good idea.
- The worst you can do is tell me to leave.
- Want to show me your home?
- Gladly.
- You do?
- Certainly. Come this way.
- Look how nice.
- It's my office.
- Have you read all of these?
- Maybe not all.
Are they just for show?
- What's in here?
- The kitchen.
This could be very nice.
Where do you sleep? In here?
Yes, here's the bedroom.
- It looks really lonely.
- You think?
Anna had promised to come,
but had to cancel last second.
She had to have an operation on her leg.
Fourth time. Poor Anna.
It was a car accident.
Both her husband and son died.
She was in the hospital
for several months.
You probably know all about it.
It happened around here.
- Is this where your wife worked?
- Yes, it is.
- Just the same as when she left.
- Are you divorced?
Yes, in a way we probably are.
- Am I being insensitive?
- No, not at all.
- Do you think she'll come back?
- We'll see.
Do you miss her a lot?
Sorry for being nosy.
Are you hungry?
I have a geologist colleague
who makes fun of me,
because I don't dare enter any caves.
- Would you like some more ham?
- No, I'm stuffed.
- "Always Romantic."
- Play that one. It's nice.
It's one of my oldest records.
It's because I suffer from claustrophobia.
I always have.
It's really a shame,
because when I was in school
I would dream about entering
those deep French caves.
But nothing came of it.
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.
Elis hates when I dance.
He gets so embarrassed.
Elis is incredibly tired of me.
- No, I don't think so.
- Yes.
I'm just a small part
of his general tiredness.
The world is rather indifferent
to his sarcasm, but I'm not.
He just wants to get even.
Can I have some more?
I just don't know what to do.
Thank you.
- Cheers then.
- Cheers.
Elis is a fantastic person.
He really is. I like Elis very much.
The worst part is that I love him.
I really mean love.
There's no other word for it.
I just don't know what I have to do
to show him my love.
Andreas, what will become of us?
Why do these things happen?
What is this deadly poison
that eats away the best in us
and only leaves an empty shell?
Hmm?
I'm so tired.
Are you?
I'm sleepy from the wine.
Yes, it makes you a bit drowsy.
Can I sleep a little here?
Of course.
You can lie down in the bedroom.
Maybe it's better to lay down
on the couch out there.
- I won't bother you?
- No, not at all.
I haven't slept all night,
I've just wandered around.
Here's something comfy for you.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- There.
- That's nice.
Pint-size, come here.
Here's a little heating pad.
Hi.
- Are you comfortable now?
- Yes, great.
Oh, my.
I must have slept for hours.
Can I borrow your phone?
I need to call Elis.
He was going to a friend's for dinner.
Certainly. Wait, I'll come with the lamp.
Let's see now. Here it is.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Do you want to be alone?
- No, no.
Hello? Hi, darling.
I'm sorry for calling so late.
What? You've already sat down for dinner?
Do you want me to call later? No?
You see, I fell asleep
and slept for several hours.
No, not at all. Everything is great.
I ran into Andreas when I was out walking.
No, now I'm alone.
No, everything's fine.
Yes. Okay, take care.
Will you be home Thursday? Positive?
Then I'll meet you at the airport.
Yes. Think nice thoughts of me.
Bye.
You probably think it was wrong
to say I was alone.
No, not at all.
He'd be furious if he knew I was here.
I must look dreadful.
Is there a comb and mirror I can borrow?
Sure.
It's in the bedroom.
Pretty gloomy in here.
Wait, let me light this.
You see, Elis isn't really jealous.
Or maybe he is.
He's going to Milan.
His assignment is a great honor,
even though he jokes about it.
He's successful.
Forever, Amen.
It's difficult when you realize one day
you're completely meaningless.
That nobody needs you,
even though all you want to do is give.
It's probably my own fault,
but it's paralyzing.
You see, I want to accomplish so much.
I make so many plans.
I'll speak with Elis and he'll say,
"You shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't do that.
You should do this."
And like sand in an hourglass
it just runs out.
No.
I shouldn't blame Elis.
I shouldn't. I shouldn't.
Everything just goes wrong for me.
And Elis, he...
No, I shouldn't. I shouldn't blame Elis.
I shouldn't.
Hello.
It's Elis Vergérus. Hi.
I've called home again and again,
but nobody's answering.
She's usually awake at night,
so I'm worried that she's not answering.
Would you be kind and go over
to make sure everything's all right?
If everything's fine,
please tell Eva that I was worried.
There's no need for her to call.
Then you call me as soon as possible.
I was pregnant once.
I couldn't sleep at all then.
They admitted me into a hospital
so I could sleep.
They were going to make me sleep
a few days.
By mistake they gave me
too strong of a dosage.
I never fell asleep, but the baby died.
Elis was with me and we cried together.
Elis cried as well.
That's never happened before or since.
Since then I've not had any children.
It's just as well.
I think it's for the best.
Do you have to go?
Have you seen how ugly I am?
Look at me, Andreas.
Have you ever slept
with a more boring lover?
Tell me I'm wrong.
You are wrong.
You've been so kind to me, Andreas.
I'll miss you terribly.
We'll soon see each other again.
Don't worry. Don't be scared.
I have to hurry,
so I don't miss the ferry.
- Will you call me?
- You want me to?
- Yes, do. Or maybe write.
- Would you rather that I write?
- Yes, it's better.
- I'll try.
When will you be back?
In two weeks for Easter.
I'll be here with Anna and Elis.
- Can't you come alone?
- I don't think so.
- Just a few days.
- I'll try.
Look here. Come here.
- Take care of him.
- Me?
Yes, he's yours. You'll sleep better.
It was becoming clear
that there was a madman on the island.
One morning
Olsson discovers eight of his sheep
killed and horribly mutilated.
The police investigates
and makes inquiries.
They discover other cases
of animal cruelty in the previous months.
Andreas tells the police
how he found his puppy.
Anger and suspicion
sweep through the island.
It's okay to bury the animals now.
I met one of the policemen
yesterday on the ferry.
They have no leads,
but the locals suspect
Johan Andersson out on Skir.
He's been in a mental institution,
and that alone is suspicious.
He lives alone, completely isolated.
He never speaks
and doesn't socialize or have animals.
I photographed him a few years ago.
I just brought out the pictures.
Here.
He was fairly sociable then,
but he became embroiled in a lawsuit,
which he lost.
It broke him
and he's been in isolation since.
I've been thinking
about your financial situation.
Concerning the loan you want me to sign.
That would be...
Yes, I think I can help you.
- Does the light bother you?
- No, no.
- You sure?
- It's fine.
- My lawyer can draft a payment schedule.
- I'd be happy if you want to.
I'm sure it would work out anyway,
but I'm grateful.
- Do you think it's hot?
- No, not too bad.
There's only one small problem.
You need to make some money
so you can handle the payments.
Do you have any ideas?
No.
No rush at the moment.
While you're thinking about it,
perhaps you'd like to type up my notes?
I have a lot of research notes
on that damn culture center in Milan.
- That's a good idea.
- Yes, it is.
Turn your head to the left,
but look at the camera.
Look at the camera.
Your chin is slightly too high.
Lower it. There.
Slowly turn your head to the right.
Still looking at the camera.
Like that. A little more.
Hold it there. Hold it. There. Thank you.
Hold it there. Thank you.
- Whiskey?
- No, thank you.
Mind if I have some?
No, not at all. Go ahead and drink.
I don't presume to reach people's souls
with my photography.
Definitely not.
I can only register the interaction
of thousands of large and small forces.
Then you look at the image
and let imagination take over.
It's all nonsense. Plays, poems.
You can't read another human being
with any sort of certainty.
Even horrendous physical pain
will not always register.
She didn't know I took this picture.
She'd just gotten one of her migraines.
It's damn interesting.
Hi. Sorry to disturb you. Hi.
I'm just dropping off the post.
I'm leaving again.
- Falkman is wondering which thermostats...
- He should be able to figure it out.
Can you keep Andreas company for now?
Andreas?
Yes.
I just want you to know that I'm not angry
or jealous or anything like that.
Anna told me about you two.
I think she's in love.
I think so, but it's difficult
to know anything about Anna's feelings.
I like you both very much.
I like you a lot, Andreas.
I think of you almost all the time.
My dear.
My dear.
You should be careful with Anna.
I can't explain what I mean,
but you should be careful.
What is it, Elis? You look angry.
It's always trivial matters
that make me furious.
Shall we continue, Andreas,
or are you tired?
- No, not at all.
- When is lunch?
In an hour.
Bye.
You've been in prison, right?
Yes, I've been in prison.
Well? Well?
It was a fit of panic.
I was convicted of check fraud.
Then I was caught speeding while drunk.
Then I punched a policeman in the face.
- And now you're hiding like a beaten dog.
- I am a beaten dog.
- Do you bite?
- You'll see.
No, I don't think so.
Anna and Andreas have been
living together a few months.
She does translation work
and he's accepted Elis's proposition.
They live in modest happiness
with no real arguments orpassion.
It's early spring.
One day Anna suddenly
starts talking about her marriage.
We lived in complete togetherness.
We thought the same thoughts.
We were one in everything.
Do you understand what I mean?
I know it sounds silly and exaggerated
when I tell it,
but it's difficult to describe
how two people become one.
There are only trite words
that don't really describe the experience.
Don't you think?
And our child became
a source of joy for both of us.
Everything that had to do with the child.
Do you understand?
Then I graduated
and got a teaching position,
and Andreas became an associate professor.
We bought a little house
outside of the city,
which we decorated
whenever we could afford to.
We built something together.
I don't know what to call it...
A real sense of security.
Security.
Everybody probably thought
Andreas and I had the perfect marriage,
without tensions,
but that wasn't the case.
We had violent arguments,
but we never infected each other
with cruelty or suspicion.
And we were always completely honest.
There wasn't an ounce of pretense
in our relationship.
Andreas was unfaithful once.
You never would have guessed, huh?
Yes, he was unfaithful.
But because he told me
about it immediately,
I felt how much he loved me
and it all passed.
And we cared even more for each other.
The worst part was when he once left me.
But I found him.
He changed his mind and came back to me.
And we became even closer than before.
Then one weekend,
we stayed out here with our little boy.
We had borrowed Eva's and Elis's home.
It was Sunday and we'd just eaten.
Andreas wanted to nap,
but I wanted to drive to the church ruins.
I got my way and we went.
Andreas had been drinking, so I drove.
I wasn't going all that fast.
We were in a great mood.
The roads were slick and the car
started sliding back and forth.
Andreas tried to grab the wheel,
but we went off the road, down the ditch,
through the stone wall and into the trees.
When I came to I saw a wrecked car,
and a decapitated man
with half his body through the windshield.
A bit farther away lay a little boy.
He had been thrown from the vehicle.
He was lying with his head
in a strange position.
I remember thinking
what a terrible accident.
That there was nobody there
to help these poor people.
I made my way back to the road
and slowly began to feel pain
down one side.
I felt that I was dragging my leg
behind me.
Then I saw blood.
There was blood everywhere.
The bone was poking through my stocking.
Several hours later they found us.
I didn't think life would be this way.
I didn't think that life would amount
to such daily suffering.
...physical and psychological violence.
Good day. How are you doing?
- Are you stuck?
- Yes.
- Can we help?
- Thanks.
They'll kill me.
Why would anybody want to do that?
Because of that animal cruelty.
This was thrown through the window.
"You bastard animal killer.
We'll do to you
as you've done to the animals."
It was through that window.
Like I'd kill animals.
Johan, if you want,
we'll speak to the police.
They don't care about me.
They've already been here.
Can't you leave?
Where would I go?
There must be something we can do.
What?
Let me adjust the antenna.
Stop there.
It could have been a bird.
It might be hurt.
Better go take a look.
I'll get the flashlight.
It's best to kill it.
- It wouldn't have survived, would it?
- No.
It was too injured.
Now we'll see a bit better.
Why do you think the bird
was flying alone at night?
I don't know.
Maybe something frightened it.
Admit that you and Eva had a relationship
when she lived here alone last fall.
That's not the case.
Eva is completely defenseless.
She can't defend herself.
Anyone can do what they like with her.
She doesn't need
to defend herself against me.
To me Eva is a woman
who can no longer cope
with the fact
of her own disconnectedness.
And not to have an identity of her own,
only the creation of others,
never to have any rest
or any feeling of self-worth
makes me think she'll attempt suicide.
But suicide is not really a solution,
it's just another selfish act,
and I hope they manage to save her.
I hope that when she awakens...
she'll have been through something
that liberates her from herself.
That she can look upon her old self...
with tenderness, warmth,
and without any regret.
I think that she chooses...
for example, to become
a teacher for the hearing impaired,
because deaf people
live in an even deeper isolation
and loneliness than she ever has.
I think she'll experience liberation...
and mercy.
- And then?
- There's nothing more.
I only exist here as a formality.
The lamp went out.
No, you're strangling me.
Warning signs lie beneath the surface,
and they manifest themselves unexpectedly.
Anna described a dream,
a long, continuous dream,
which had troubled her around Easter.
I was alone on the road.
I felt a terrible longing
for companionship,
for an embrace, for rest.
And at the same time,
I knew this was gone forever.
- Can I come home with you?
- No, you can't.
We can't receive strangers anymore,
it's forbidden.
We've changed the locks on the doors.
- Why?
- I don't know. It's just how it is.
- Can't you stay for a while?
- No, I have to run.
Stay!
Stay.
I don't know where I am.
What is this place?
Can't you help me?
Who is that woman over there?
Her son is being executed.
She's on her way there.
Forgive... Forgive me.
Good day. We'd like to speak with you,
if that's all right?
- Of course, come on in.
- Thank you.
Johan Andersson on Skir
has been found dead,
and he left this letter addressed to you.
- When did it happen?
- We found him today, hanged.
He had contusions to the head
and appeared to have been beaten.
You're of course anxious
to find out what's in the letter.
Yes, and we'd like the letter back
as it might help with the investigation.
"Dear Andreas,
A few hours ago some people came by
and told me I was a criminal
and that I'm going to be punished for it.
They dragged me out into the yard
by my hair,
where they began beating me
and spitting on me.
One of them, the younger one,
took a rock and hit me over the head.
I was confused
and said that I was innocent.
They said that if I confessed
they would leave me in peace,
and not hit me anymore.
I told them I would confess...
I told them I would confess
and they stopped beating my face.
They put me against the wall
and told me to talk.
I said anything
I thought they might want to hear.
When I couldn't think of anything else
they knocked me to the ground.
One of them stood over me...
and urinated on my face,
but I couldn't defend myself
because I was too weak.
They began kicking me where I lay.
They stepped on my glasses
and my false teeth fell out of my mouth.
I couldn't find them later.
I passed out, so I don't know
what they did to me after that.
When I woke, they had left in their cars
and I managed to get back inside.
I felt that I didn't want to live anymore...
because I could no longer
look anybody in the eye.
Therefore,
I don't want to live any longer.
I'm writing this letter to you,
dear Andreas,
because you've always been good to me
and always been concerned with my health.
With kindest regards..."
Thank you. That's all.
Can I get it back, perhaps?
Yes, as soon
as the investigation is finished.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Anna?
Anna?
Hello?
There you are.
- What are you doing?
- I'm praying for Johan.
You're only praying for your own sake.
Go away! Leave me alone! Go!
Nothing but theatrics, damn theatrics.
It looks like a pigsty.
That's not worth keeping.
Let me see.
That might work.
You can have that. Take it.
It's something from Grandpa.
I'm keeping the radio.
Good day.
I received a letter from Johan.
I see.
Anna and Andreas have lived together
in relative harmony for a year.
On occasion they've had minor clashes,
which have resulted
in arguments and reconciliations.
They were often due
to misunderstandings or bad moods,
but the words used
were never poisonous or lingering.
Anna got a big translation job,
and Andreas continued working
for Elis Vergérus.
I have a headache. Not sure why.
It's probably the weather
or maybe I'm getting a cold.
I'll make you something warm to eat.
That's nice of you.
I'm just going to finish this chapter.
It's pretty exciting actually.
Your soul is cancerous.
You'll need surgery,
radiation therapy and medicine.
You have tumors everywhere.
You'll die a terrible death.
What are you doing?
I'm looking at a photograph.
- I hope it's not an old lover.
- No.
How can you think that?
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking of cancer.
And it frightens me.
What are you thinking?
I'm not thinking anything.
- I'm thinking of the lies.
- What lies?
Andreas.
Andreas, we should travel somewhere.
We should get away from here.
I know it would be good for us both.
When you speak of traveling
I really want to say yes.
What are you thinking?
That we can speak to Elis.
He can lend us money.
But at the same time a wall appears.
I can't speak.
I can't show that I'm happy.
I can see your face, I know you're you,
but I can't reach you.
Do you understand what I mean?
I understand what you mean.
I understand very well, Andreas.
I'm on the outside of this wall.
I put myself on the outside.
I fled and now I'm so far away.
I understand, Andreas.
I understand how strange it seems.
Yes, it's strange.
I want to be warm, tender and alive.
I want to break free.
- You understand, don't you?
- It's like a dream.
You want to move,
you know what to do, but you can't.
Legs are impossible
and arms heavy as lead.
You want to speak, but you can't.
I'm terrified of being humiliated.
It's constant misery.
I've accepted the humiliation
and let them become part of me.
Do you understand what I mean?
I understand what you mean.
I understand you.
It's terrible not being fortunate.
Everybody thinks they have the right
to decide over you.
Their benevolent contempt.
A momentary desire
to trample something living.
I understand, Andreas. You don't need...
I'm dead, Anna.
No, no. I'm not dead.
No, that's wrong. Too melodramatic.
I'm not dead at all.
But I live without self-respect.
I know that sounds silly... Pretentious...
Since almost all people
are forced to live without self-worth.
Humiliated to the core,
stifled and spat upon.
They just live. They know nothing more.
They know no alternative.
Even if they did,
they would never reach for it.
You understand?
Can you be sick from humiliation?
Is it a disease we're all infected by
and we have to live with?
We talk so much about freedom, Anna.
Isn't freedom a terrible poison
for the humiliated...
or is the word "freedom" only a drug
the humiliated use in order to endure?
I can't live with this.
I've given up.
Sometimes it's almost unbearable.
The days drag by.
I feel like I'm choking
on the food I swallow,
the crap I get rid of, the words I say.
The light...
The daylight which comes every morning
and yells at me to get up.
Or the sleep which always brings dreams,
chasing me back and forth.
Or just the darkness
rattling with ghosts and memories.
Has it occurred to you, Anna,
that the worse off people are,
the less they complain?
Eventually they're silent...
even though they're living creatures
with nerves, eyes and hands.
Massive armies
of both victims and executioners.
The light which rises and sinks heavily.
The cold approaches.
Darkness.
The heat. The smell.
And everyone is silent.
We can never leave this place.
I don't believe in escape. It's too late.
Everything's too late.
I think that Elis Vergérus
finds it hypocritical
to be horrified by the madness of humans
and that it's emotional carelessness
to cry out for decency and justice.
He's decided that human suffering
won't keep him up at night.
He feels he's completely indifferent
in both his own and others' eyes.
And those are the conditions he lives by.
Otherwise,
he wouldn't be able to function.
What are you doing today?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
I asked what you were doing.
You understand that it's over now, right?
Answer!
Until you give me a reason,
I have nothing to say.
You have your freedom.
You can go when you want.
I think you lie, Andreas.
You lied about your marriage.
You lied about your divorce.
I know the truth about you.
Really? You know the truth about me?
I know what you're like.
I think you're despicable.
I think you're a parasite.
I dislike you terribly.
It's hell living here with you.
I've longed to get away all this time.
Poor, Anna. You had it so good
and were so happy before we met.
At least I had something:
a happy memory of my husband and our love.
How about now?
- I believed in truth. I lived in truth.
- You did?
You've ruined it with your damn lies.
- Stop now, Anna.
- You don't tell me what to do.
- Don't yell at me.
- I'll scream as loudly...
Don't yell at me!
You can go to hell!
Anna?
Hi.
Someone went into the stable
with a can of gasoline.
He poured 20 liters of gasoline
over the poor horse,
threw a match in the hay
and ran away fast as hell.
He locked the door from the outside
and took the key with him.
The horse stormed around inside,
while people tried to break open the door.
When they got the door open
the horse charged out... ablaze.
Yes, I'm coming.
He was incredibly strong.
Hey, Anna...
I want to be free.
I want my solitude back.
I can't live like this.
We might have made it if we truly
loved each other, but we don't.
So it's easier to part.
Don't you think?
More truthful as well.
You have to live in truth, right?
At least according to you.
So let us be truthful for once.
Why don't you answer?
Do you remember leaving your purse
at my place when we first met?
You borrowed the phone, remember?
Yes, you forgot your purse
and I found
your husband's farewell letter.
I read it.
Poor, Anna.
You're not very successful with your men.
Either something is wrong
with you or your men, right?
You're always speaking about truth,
and about living in truth.
What a terrible lie.
I remember how you spoke about your
marriage. Of all the happiness and love.
It was all lies.
Lies. It was lies, Anna.
Calm down.
Are you going to kill me like you did...
You're crazy.
You're completely insane.
What's wrong with you?
Say something.
Why did you come get me at the fire?
I came to ask for forgiveness.
This time he was called Andreas Winkelman.
THE END
