I have not slept the whole night.
Should we talk about it now?
You haven't read the newspaper?
Each page, Madam Professor.
They want to bring him
to justice in Jerusalem?
Why would the Mossad
have kidnapped him otherwise?
You think it is right?
It would have been better
that they shot him
in front of everybody in Buenos Aires.
- Yes, but...
God did not let him escape.
God no...
But the Germans, yes.
You'll see, they're not going
to request his extradition.
Do you really want
to inflict this to you?
You remember how you were shocked
to hear these terrible
news from Europe...
And how horrified you were?
I could never forgive myself
to miss such an opportunity.
You said how intelligent and courageous
I have been to flee Gurs.
You have been, sweet heart.
Many women stayed in the fear
that their husbands would not find them
if they left the camp.
I would have found you anywhere.
Maybe not.
In the heat of this summer,
there was still hope...
it would be over soon.
And then...
The wait...
More and more women would let go,
would not complain anymore...
and would not clean themselves more.
They would lie on their straw mats.
I tried to encourage them...
I was sometimes harsh,
sometimes nice.
But one night...
It had rained all day,
the straw mats were fraying.
I lost all courage.
I felt so tired.
So tired...
I wanted to leave...
this world...
I loved so much.
And at this moment, I...
I imagined you in front of me.
looking for me...
And not finding me.
Do you understand why
I don't want to let you go?
Congratulations.
Hannah, great!
Did you ask them?
And they just said "yes"?
They agreed.
Simply.
For a genius, everything is simple.
Come on, that's enough!
You know,
I kind of fear this trip.
I wish I could go with you.
Hans, that would be nice.
I would feel better.
Thank you.
If you want: "chips".
- Our train was late.
- Sure.
We know that excuse.
Put yourself at ease.
Everyone is there.
It's nice you could come.
Do not mention my name
in the same breath as this Nazi.
Hans!
This is not a great trial,
this is illegal.
This is an illegal abduction committed
by these Mossad morons.
Israel has the sacred right
to trial a Nazi
for his crimes against
the Jewish people.
Sacred right?
Hans, you're crazy.
Most survivors live there.
Exactly.
And they want to see him,
confront him.
Confront him!
We will drag them all to court!
They will be witnesses.
- The trial will last forever!
- This trial...
Israel did not exist as a State
at the time of the Nazi crimes.
Alas!
Otherwise they would have declared war
to Hitler as England and France did.
But we were there anyway!
We did our duty,
we fought the Nazis in the British army.
In 1944, in the Jewish Brigade,
I and others
brave men of Israel.
We know.
Heinrich does not know
what it means to take up arms
to defend his convictions.
Convictions that lead him to emigrate.
Like many.
He has no merit.
Nobody wants to take away your merit, Hans.
Hannah always reminds us how much
she admires the soldier you were.
Not just the soldier.
Lotte!
Nuremberg accused Eichmann
and he managed to escape arrest.
He must be judged
by an international tribunal.
- There are none!
- Exactly!
If the trial goes
as you predict...
You cannot judge the whole history.
You just can judge a man.
Indeed. A man is judged.
To murder.
Yes . For murder.
And you have to prove...
See you soon.
- Thank you, my dear.
- See you soon.
We were harsh with Hans.
Tell him I'm sorry.
- You always say that.
- I know.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye...
- Be careful with this storm.
Really.
Yeah... I have a perverse pleasure...
to tease this dear Hans a little.
Especially when he is happy
to send you to hell.
Oh... sacred you.
Here:
"He thanked the Führer
when taking office."
MEMBER OF THE PARTY HEIDEGGER...
Then they sang the Horst-Wessel-Lied.
Hi, Scoundrel!
Hi, Rascal!
Hannah!
My dear Hannah!
Jerusalem...
your love.
Yeah.
How is my dear Heinrich?
- Is he nice to you?
- Yes.
Even too sweet.
I would like him
to slap me on the wrist:
I am confused in this maze of events.
This is my wrist he slapped.
He is afraid that all this plunges me back
in these dark hours.
This trial is very important for us.
You're strong...
Hannah
you've always been.
And brave.
Very brave.
You'd rather tell me how you are.
How's your heart?
Not very well.
It never got used to accept
the reality of our world.
Israel has aged faster than you,
my little Hannah.
I always thought you'd have
tons of kids someday.
Oh, Jenny.
We were too poor then.
When we could afford it,
we were too old.
Many are poor here.
But they have children.
Children are important.
It is a young country.
It was about time
that you could visit us.
- She is not visiting.
- You see?
He already wants to get rid of me.
Pity the reason of your visit
is a predator.
This is why he is shown in a cage.
- A cage?
- Glass cage.
To protect ourselves from him.
The Court!
As I stand here before you,
judges of Israel,
to lead the charge
against Adolf Eichmann,
I am not alone.
With me at this time
are six million accusers.
But they can't get up
to point an accusing finger
towards the glass cage
and cry to the one inside:
"I accuse!"
For their ashes are scattered
on the hills of Auschwitz
and the fields of Treblinka,
and are engulfed in the rivers of Poland.
Their graves are scattered
throughout Europe.
On all its area.
Their blood cries.
But we can't hear their calls.
And Hausner is strutting
as if he competed with Eichmann
for a role in a play!
His dramatic opening speech
was predictable.
Ben Gurion asked for this?
He is the one who pulls the strings, no?
Israel must ensure that
it doesn't become a show trial.
This is all you, Hannah!
Wait a minute.
And try to understand Ben Gurion.
Our young people refuse
to confront themselves
to these dark hours, as you call them.
Or they are ashamed of their parents
who haven't defended themselves
or they blame them for
their disgraceful conduct.
They think that only the criminals
or the whores were able to survive.
And you think Hausner
can bring them understanding
to the suffering of their parents?
Do show a little patience with us.
I read that 15 people died
during transportation.
I can only say that these figures
could not be registered
by the GB4 Department.
They come from local authorities.
This is the result of the instructions.
The report in question shows that
the local police or neighborhoods
sent their request to authority 4.
This is how I was
put in charge of this case
I treated as an intermediate task,
as I was ordered.
I had to obey orders.
But in the instructions, you fixed
the number of people to park
in the train cars, is that correct?
I was given the order.
Whether or not they were killed,
this order was to be executed.
It was executed in an
administrative manner.
I was in charge of only a small part.
The other necessary parts,
such as the transportation,
were executed by other parties.
Mr. President,
I feel like a steak you want to cook
for a fact
riddled with inaccuracies,
as we can clearly prove it here.
You finally heard the predator.
You don't feel well?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.
Good.
Okay.
So what?
He is very different
from what I had imagined.
This is one of the most dangerous
people among the SS.
Not at all, precisely.
This is the point.
He is sitting in his glass cage.
Like a ghost...
Besides, he has a cold.
He doesn't scare at all.
He is insignificant.
He speaks in this horrible
administrative jargon.
He suddenly says phrases like:
"I feel like a steak you want to cook."
Incredible!
Waiter!
No steak, isn't it?
Want to cheer me up?
"The intention is perceptible
and we are upset."
"The intention can be felt
and we are shocked."
" Is allowed what pleases."
This is also Tasso.
"Is allowed what is right."
"If you would learn precisely
what is proper,
"then do no more
than ask of noble women."
My father was a tailor in Berlin.
He was always quoting "Faust"
when shaving.
Mephisto, preferably.
"Blood is a peculiar juice..."
Eichmann.
Eichmann is not Mephisto.
Later when we were
transported elsewhere...
200 or 210 of us stayed,
on the 1,200 that had been brought.
The next ones were all gassed.
Those who arrived just after us
were all gassed
It was...
Forgive me...
Please, try...
Start again.
Please calm down.
Remain seated!
Everyone remain seated.
Remain seated!
I suspend the hearing, unless
the witness recovers his mind.
Mr. Hausner, don't count on that.
I think the witness can hardly recover.
If you could see how people try to
testify calmly...
Most of the stories have
nothing to do with Eichmann
as an individual.
But we both knew from
the beginning that this trial
would deal more with a historical fact
than with the acts of a single man.
But still it's awful.
My poor little girl, away from home.
Already three minutes.
It costs a fortune, we need to hang up.
Yes.
See you soon.
Take him out quickly.
Out! You interfere here!
You're a dirty coward!
Bastard!
Remain seated, remain seated,
if you want to stay!
An officer takes oath
of allegiance to the flag.
If he breaks this oath...
this man is a pest.
This is my opinion.
I have sworn to tell the truth here.
This was my view at that time:
an oath is an oath.
Do you think
a person taking an oath
is released from her oath
after Hitler's death?
After Hitler's death,
every man is indeed
freed from this oath.
At the questioning, you said
that if the Führer had told you
that your father was a traitor,
you would have shot him
with your own hands.
If he had been a traitor,
certainly.
No, if the Führer had told you so.
Would you have killed
your own father?
Provided he proved it to me.
If he had, my oath
would have forced me to.
Were you proved that the Jews
should be exterminated?
I have not exterminated them.
Have you ever felt a conflict
between your job
and your conscience?
I'd rather say a duality 
- Duality?
- Yes...
A conscious duality...
where we sail from one extreme
to the other and vice versa.
We had to give up our conscience.
Sorry?
We had to give up
our individual consciousness.
It could be said like that.
If there had been
more civic courage,
things would have been different.
- Am I right? Answer...
- Civic courage...
If there had been a hierarchical
structure, yes, certainly.
It was not a fate
that was supposed to happen.
It is a matter of human behavior.
It was a matter of human behavior.
It was so...
It was war, it was agitated...
Everyone was saying:
it is useless to resist...
- Yes.
- A drop in the ocean,
useless, no success or...
or failure or something...
I guess...
this is due to the time.
At the time,
for the education of children,
ideologies that were applied,
military training, this stuff.
Eichmann is not anti-Semitic?
What a humbug!
You heard him.
He just obeyed the law.
He would obey any law.
All those who joined the party,
especially as SS,
were convinced and evil anti-semites.
He swears he personally
never hurt a Jew.
Let him make twists with it!
But isn't it interesting
that a man
who has done everything
a murderous system demanded of him,
who even hastens
to disclose any details about his work,
that this man insists
on the fact that he has nothing
against Jews.
- He's lying!
- This is false. He's not lying.
You're falling into the trap!
He says he didn't know
where the trains were going.
Do you believe that too?
This information did not matter to him.
He transported people.
To death. But he didn't feel responsible.
Once the trains were gone,
his work was done.
And he thinks he is
in no way responsible
for the fate of the people
he had transported?
Yes. It is his vision.
He is a bureaucrat.
Your quest for truth honors you,
but you're mislead!
But Kurt, you can't deny
the huge difference
between the unimaginable cruelty of a man
and his mediocrity.
Don't worry, Rachel.
This is the way we argue,
Hannah and I.
I'm just afraid she irritates
many other people.
This is her nature.
But every time we got K.O...
we always reconciled.
Hey. Kurt, no!
Think of your heart.
I know. I'm not getting any younger.
If only your feet were made of lead,
you could not constantly escape anymore!
I don't run away from you.
Never.
What's inside?
Copies of the minutes.
Six tapes of Eichmann's questioning.
I could have sent them to you
in New York by cargo ship.
I have to start reading them right now.
Bring Heinrich,
next time.
You are here!
And your classes?
Canceled!
It was an emergency.
Thank you, Freddy.
How good it is to be back!
Four pounds...
Can you see it?
I starved myself for you.
Look at the homework waiting for me.
You take a few days off.
Rascal, I have 2,000 pages to read
before the semester begins.
Calm down, Ms. Professor.
From Mary.
No.
From me.
Rascal! This is the wrong stack.
Miller asked me to take care
of another course.
Someone is sick or divorcing
or a typical American thing.
I can't cope with it already!
You have to learn to say no.
Only to others, of course.
Hannah...
So?
This polite Mr. Shawn did not say much,
he is certainly very curious to know
when you will hand over your articles.
There is not even any verdict yet!
Yes...
And how dare he call you,
this Mr. Shawn?
I think he can't imagine
that a writer as famous as yourself
is struggling with a stack of papers
and not write a word.
But this gentleman here, would have
written this article long ago.
There is no doubt.
- Thank you.
- Professor.
You can use my office.
You just have to get
the pipe holder out.
Your doctor will be happy!
This is the pot calling...
You're leaving without a kiss or a slap?
One musn't interfere with
great philosophers in their thinking.
But how can they think without a hug?
It's from Israel.
At least 500 new pages from court.
I'll sort them out later.
Lotte, what would I do without you?
I would have never been so close
with my own daughter.
My father says that God
has given us a family,
but that thanks to him
we can choose our friends.
Yes...
You think I would have chosen Charlotte?
Oh, I forgot: she called.
She wanted Heinrich's
new number at Bard.
You gave it to him?
I couldn't find it.
Attention, Lotte.
This psychoanalyst probably
practices telepathy.
I take them back?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
They slept like the dead.
Someone came in and shouted:
Hurry up, the SS are coming.
I had two friends with me...
I've pushed them too.
Once a week, the infamous Dr. Mengele
proceeded to a selection.
The rumor about the arrival
of Dr. Mengele was enough
to sow terror throughout the camp.
Admittedly guilty...
Politicians...
If there had been more
of what I call civic courage,
things would have turned out differently.
FACULTY OF PHILOSOPHY
DR M. HEIDEGGER
Miss Arendt.
You say you want
to learn to think with me.
Thinking
is a solitary occupation.
You are my hero!
Thank you!
You see,
the Western tradition
suffers from the prejudice that
the worst that a man can do
comes from its self-centeredness.
But in this century which is ours,
evil has revealed
more radical than was anticipated.
We now know that the greatest evil,
radical evil
has nothing to do with patterns
humanly understandable and immoral
such as egocentricity.
Instead, it is mainly related
to the following phenomenon:
it is the fact of making
people redundant.
The whole system in
the concentration camps was
convincing prisoners
that they were unnecessary...
before they were killed.
In the camps, people would learn
that the punishment
was not related to a crime,
that the operation
did not benefit anyone,
and that work
did not need to be profitable.
The camp is a place
where each fact and gesture
is by definition devoid of meaning.
Where in other words,
it creates absurdity.
I summarize:
if it is true that
at the final stage of totalitarianism
an absolute evil appears,
absolute because it is not to be
attributed to human reasons,
then it is also true
that without it,
without totalitarianism,
we would never know
the radical nature of evil.
What time is it?
The second hour began.
You know what that means.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Please.
Have you been in a concentration camp?
I had the occasion
to spend some time
in the Gurs camp, in France.
At the beginning, yes.
They welcomed us.
But Germans invaded France
on 10 May 1940,
our French friends suddenly packed us
in an internment camp.
We became a new kind of breed
placed by its enemies
in concentration camps
and by its friends in internment camps.
How did you manage to escape?
A visa. Not a passport.
We've been stateless for 18 years.
What was your first
impression of America?
Do you understand?
Hannah!
My dear...
Don't cry.
I talked to the doctor.
You have 50 percent chance
to get on with it.
You forget the remaining 50 percent.
What were you talking about
with your students?
About us.
They will hang Eichmann.
- This is good.
- Well...
But it is not fair.
The sentence is too weak?
The sentence is justice
only in appearance.
There is no real sentence for such acts.
It would be more courageous
to leave him alive!
The verdict was given:
You don't need to avoid your friends
from the New Yorker anymore.
No.
First start by recovering.
You didn't write anything
since my small accident.
Wrong. I took notes.
And a brain aneurysm
is not a small accident.
You could have died.
Yes. But Eichmann is a monster.
When I say monster,
I don't speak of the devil.
No need to be smart or strong
to behave like a monster.
You oversimplify.
What is new in the Eichmann phenomenon,
is that his likes are many.
This is an horribly normal individual.
Not all normal individuals
ran the section IV B4
installed in the Reich Security Office
and in charge of the extermination
of the European Jews.
You're right.
But he considered himself...
as a servant, serving Germany
and obeying the Führer.
"My loyalty is my honor."
The order of the Führer was the law.
And he pleaded not guilty to the charge:
He was acting according to the law.
The documents show that
Eichmann led the "final solution"
well after Himmler forbade him.
And why?
He wanted to finish his work.
You don't see that each law,
each order was completely reversed?
It was no more
"Thou shalt not kill",
but  "Thou shalt kill."
To accomplish his task,
he had to resist temptation
- to be good.
- Great.
So nobody is responsible or guilty.
Any sane man knows
that it is wrong to kill.
Most Europeans, including our friends,
- have suddenly got ill.
- Heidegger was your friend.
Hans!
He is not the only one
to have disappointed us.
Hannah, you can't write this
for the New Yorker.
- No way.
- Hans, the glass door!
This is too abstract.
This is ambiguous.
They don't want
a philosophical treatise.
They want to know
what the Nazi Eichmann did.
- You want to forgive him?
- What twaddle!
I'm glad he will be hanged.
Let's drink to Heinrich recovery!
Hey, Hans. To Heinrich.
Scoundrel, cheers.
No more kisses.
Except for me.
Why was Hans so furious against me?
Because he loves you.
Just like when he was a student.
Bullshit!
He hates Heidegger
more for conquering you
than to have joined the party.
So he should hate you more.
This may be the case.
My recovery party
exhausted me.
I'm going to bed.
Thinking
does not lead to any knowledge
compared to science.
Thinking
brings no
practical wisdom.
Thinking
does not solve any
of the great enigmas of the world.
Thinking gives
no immediate strength
to act.
We live
because we are living beings.
And we think
because we are thinking beings.
We are so accustomed to consider
reason and passion as antagonists
that the image of a passionate thought
where the idea and the fact
of being alive would be one
almost scares me.
- Excuse me.
- No. Hannah!
You say you were not
a normal executioner.
That you were not responsible
for your actions.
Isn't that what you said?
- No, I never thought of it.
- You never thought of it?
- Sorry?
- You did not think of it?
You were an idiot.
- You did not think?
- Think?
- Yes.
- Think? Of course I did.
You were not an idiot?
You're sure you can go?
You've alarmed them so much
they want me with a wheelchair.
Charming women will fight
to push you.
Nobody can push me as well as you.
Lotte...
Take good care of her.
Thank you.
Listen.
I changed the beginning.
"Evil, we learned,
is something demonic:
" it embodies Satan.
"With the best will in the world,
" we cannot detect any evil
or demonic depth in Eichmann,
"he was simply unable to think."
- This is excellent.
- It is better, right?
Yes...
Ignore them...
You drive yourself crazy!
But Shawn's response in
the New Yorker is very convincing.
- You want me to send it to you?
- What response?
To a nasty article published
in the New York Times.
Ah, that one!
I don't care!
Rather tell me how Heinrich is.
Charlotte is cooking
for him every night.
Please, Heinrich can eat meat
only twice a week.
Yes.
Hello...
Darling.
- You goddamn piss me off.
- Hello, Scoundrel...
Come on, let's not waste
our time with that.
Jerusalem General Attorney flew
to come and talk with
survivors in New York.
This was the headline of the Daily News:
- It made the cover.
- A storm in a teacup.
This is not a storm.
This is a hurricane, Hannah.
Rather tell me
what you're going to eat tonight.
Spinach,
full bread, water.
It's good you're not in New York.
They all blame you
to defend Eichmann, Hannah.
Scoundrel, these are just
a few articles in a magazine.
Darling,
you're really naïve.
She thinks her sarcasm will protect her.
He only shows his vulnerability.
She tries to keep
away from this story
and in doing so,
she appropriates it all the more.
False, totally false.
This is not about her.
But where is she
when she writes about
this Nazi and his crimes?
She has the right to feel pain
and to show it.
This would be shameless.
And it doesn't look like her.
You must be aware that
if she repressed this pain,
it will eventually catch her up.
And you too.
Professor Heidegger came to see you.
Thank you.
This is one of the secrets of time:
it comes back and
can transform everything.
When I saw you there
in your prettiest dress,
I knew that a new and
prosperous period began for us.
Please, stop for a moment.
I did not know if I should come.
There is no greater invitation
than being the first to love:
"Nulla enim is maior
" ad quam praevenire Invitation amorem
"amando." Saint Augustin.
Your last letter saddened me.
How could you believe
all these slanders?
I felt a heart throb
when I read your rector speech.
I couldn't believe
that my mentor
would behave like an idiot.
I know that these years have been
tough for you, filled with misery
deprivation and vulnerability.
For me too, they were hard.
Martin, I came because
I want to understand.
Hannah...
I'm like a boy who dreamt
and doesn't know what he is doing.
On the political level,
I'm not talented nor experienced,
but I know it and I hope...
to learn more.
So as not to omit any thinking.
Why don't you make a public statement?
"In the muted dialogue
I feed myself with, I am alone."
- Do you remember me?
- Of course.
You were in the Kurt Blumenfeld
zionist group in Berlin.
Your secret services have sent you
to talk about my youthful indiscretions?
The State of Israel has bought
four plane tickets just to tell me that?
You must be rolling in money
for wasting so much!
We can't understand that you, Jewish,
spread such lies on your people.
This is a book that
I have never written.
A book that will never
be published in Israel.
And that should not be published
anywhere, if you have any decency.
You forbid books,
and you speak of decency!
- I'm warning you.
- No, you threaten me!
We wanted Kurt Blumenfeld
to take you back to reason,
but he is dying.
We didn't want to be so cruel.
You didn't know?
Rivka, why didn't you
let me know earlier?
Kurt didn't want it.
What are you doing, my dear!
You went too far this time.
No argument today.
This cruelty...
and lack of respect from you.
You'll think differently when you read.
I've tried.
Since when do you listen to others
when it comes to me?
Do you feel no love for Israel?
Don't you love your people?
I can't laugh anymore with you.
Kurt, you know me though.
I have never loved a people.
Why should I love the Jews?
I only love my friends.
This is the only love I am capable of.
Kurt...
I love you.
Those ones think
your articles are excellent.
Those ones think
you're completely wrong
and shouldn't have written anything.
Anybody I know?
Yes. Some friends.
And those ones wish you death.
Some do not lack imagination.
I go.
Oh, Lotte!
I'm late?
Good.
Oh, Hannah, I didn't know...
Lore, I'm glad to see you.
I came to help Lotte.
No, just sit down first.
Here.
You were there yesterday?
I didn't want to leave Lotte alone.
- Thank you.
- It goes without saying.
How is Hans?
He...
Why didn't he come?
He doesn't feel good.
Oh, God!
What do they write?
Nothing.
Come on, Lotte.
Read it to us.
This is nice of you
to have stayed tonight.
You've had such a rough day.
When I was a child,
my father was very ill.
He died when I was seven.
After a long struggle.
I've always known him sick.
And in my dream, he is...
he is in good health.
He is beautiful.
He looks at me and says:
"I love you."
- What are you doing with the letters?
- I'll answer.
No, you're not gonna do it.
It will never end otherwise.
Yes, but I terribly hurt these people.
I take it seriously.
We've lived here for twenty years.
I don't want to pack my bags again.
They will not expel you
for some few articles.
Are you so sure?
Hans, if I had known you were there.
I came...
with the vain hope
that you would understand.
But you are and remain the same.
Hannah, with this...
arrogance of yours,
and your ignorance, long known,
of Jewish things, you turn a trial
in a philosophical treatise.
Hans, please, I'm too exhausted.
You're acting like a German
intellectual quibbling
who despises Jews.
And you try to make us
accomplices of the Holocaust!
You never accepted that the Germans
have shamefully betrayed you.
They have expelled you, and they'd
have killed you if they had the chance!
Your friend Eichmann was responsible
for Gurs transportation.
If you didn't get the chance
to escape in time,
you would have suffered
the same fate as the other women!
Stop!
They have all been transported!
All deported to-
Stop now, Hans!
From now on,
I give up on Heidegger's
preferred student.
The whole world is trying
to prove that I'm wrong.
And no one sees my real mistake.
Evil can not be both
ordinary and radical.
Evil is always extreme.
Never radical.
Good is always deep and radical.
Would you have covered the trial
if you knew what was expecting you?
Yes.
I would have covered it.
Maybe to learn who my real friends are.
Kurt was your friend
and would have remained it.
Kurt was my family.
