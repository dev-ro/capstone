Do you speak English?
Yes.

The package arrived safely.
- (IN ROMANIAN) Hi.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- (IN ROMANIAN) Hi.
- Come see your room.
How was the journey?
Long.
Thought I'd got
the wrong island.
This is it.
And here's the patio.
(WAVES CRASHING)
(BIRDS TWEETING)
The pool is down there.
Forget what happened
in Bucharest.
I did it for
the surveillance cameras.
(BELL RINGING)
(SIREN WAILING)
GILDA: (SPEAKING ROMANIAN)
Detective Cristi Anghelache?
I'm Gilda, Zsolt's partner.
I'm being followed.
The car to my right. Don't look.
(MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
They think I'm your girl.
Let's go to your place to talk.
There are cameras
all over the house.
Help me get Zsolt out of prison.
No.
(DEEP BASS MUSIC PLAYING)
On an island, in the Canaries,
there's a whistling language.
I'm not interested.
You'll come to the island
and learn the language.
Let's speak in the elevator.
Are you crazy?
There's no risk.
We'll communicate
without anyone knowing.
Count me out. Period.
Won't you invite me in?
They'll figure out we're
not together if I leave now.
(ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES)
Where are the cameras?
In the picture frame in the
living room,
the icon in the kitchen
and the mirror in my room.
U-huh. Wait.
They saw us kiss downstairs.
If you say I'm your girlfriend,
they'll know it's not true.
How much cash do you have?
About 300 lei.
Take this.
I'm a high-class hooker.
That's half my salary.
We don't meet often.
GILDA: A cop only earns
1,000 euro a month?
CRISTI: Yes.
Wait. Let me give you something.
CRISTI: What are these?
GILDA: Ferry and flight tickets
to get to the island.
CRISTI: No chance. You'll stay
half an hour then leave.
(KEYS JANGLE)
- Wine?
- Please.
Red? White?
Red, as usual.
(GLASSES CLINKING)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
GILDA: Where's that still life?
What still life?
The painting you had
instead of this landscape.
I took it to my mother's.
GILDA: How's your mum?
Still obsessed with her garden?
Can you come help me
with the wine?
Can you give me a hand?
Sure.
Cheers!
Cheers.
How long since we last met?
Four months?
Five, six.
You have the money?
Yeah.
Can you show me?
One, two, three,
four, five hundred.
Perfect!
GILDA:
Shall we go to the bedroom?
Come on.
I have another client at 11.

The Whistling Language
(IN ENGLISH) The whistling
language is a code, like Morse.
Everything we speak
can be whistled.
And if the police
hear the language,
they will think
the birds are singing.
For example,
my name, Kiko.
(HIGH PITCH WHISTLES,
LOW PITCH WHISTLE)
Good day.
(ROLLING WHISTLE,
LOW PITCH TO HIGH PITCH)
How do you say "good day"
in Romanian?
"Buna ziua."
- Buna...
- "Buna ziua."
(LOW PITCH SHORT WHISTLE)
(HIGH PITCH WHISTLE)
(IN ENGLISH) Let's whistle!
Put your finger like this,
like you have a gun,
and put it in your mouth.
The angle must be this.
Like the bullet will come
out through your ear.
KIKO: Tak.
- Tak. Okay?
- (CRISTI BLOWING)
(BLOWING)
The lips. Lips.
A little more inside, like
an old man with no teeth, hmm?
(TWO HIGH PITCHED WHISTLES)
(BLOWING)
The air is not from your lungs.
Here. Here. (BLOWS)
- (BOTH BLOWING)
- KIKO: Huh?
(IN SPANISH) He's short of
breath. He has to go swimming.
But not in a pool.
In the ocean.
(IN SPANISH) Okay.
(IN ROMANIAN)
You need to swim in the ocean.
(WAVES CRASHING)
(SEAGULLS CAWING)
(UPBEAT SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING)
(ENGINE REVS)
KIKO: Guanches.
(IN ENGLISH)
Sorry?
KIKO: The first inhabitants of
the island were called Guanches.
The invented whistling language.
Let's practice. Come on.
How have the police
found out about us.
It was a phone call.
Anonymous.
Whistle. Whistle.
(BLOWING, BEGINS TO WHISTLE)
Good. The hand, very good.
(WHISTLES WEAKLY)
(WHISTLES WEAKLY)
Remember, the tongue
is under the finger.
Uh-huh. (WHISTLES WEAKLY)
(WHISTLES WEAKLY)
In what language
was the phone call?
I don't know.
All I know, it was a woman.
MAGDA: (IN ROMANIAN) Zsolt.
Owner of a mattress factory
which exports to Venezuela.
I got an anonymous tip that
he's laundering drug money.
It seems there's 30 million
in cash in the factory.
MAGDA:
This is the factory entrance.
And the employees.
I need an informer
inside the factory.
Preferably a woman.
The anonymous caller
was a woman.
Probably scared to say more.
- I see.
- All right.
Cristi, get all you can
on Zsolt, everything.
Got it.

Good evening.
Room 19, please.
Has the motel changed name?
When I started two months ago
it had the same name.
Another five, please.
You put the prices up?
(OPERA MUSIC GROWS LOUDER)
You're not worried you'll lose
customers with this music?
On the contrary.
We're trying to educate them.
(KEYS JINGLING)
(CAR PASSES OUTSIDE)
(IN ROMANIAN)
The call was made by a woman.
Find out who it is.
Where's the surveillance camera?
In front of the main gate.
At head-height? Or higher?
Higher.
Probably on a lamp post.
Does the factory have
any other exits?
One other.
There's a camera there too.
Surveillance cameras
always cover doors or gates.
(SIGHING) I've got to go.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
(OPERA MUSIC CONTINUES)
(BELL RINGS)
Zsolt Nagy.
Born in Deva, lived there
until he finished high school.
He had a criminal record
as a teenager.
His brother studied
medicine in Cluj.
He brought him weed
occasionally.
He smoked with two schoolmates.
One of them ratted on him.
The police caught
him in a sting.
He cut a deal by
snitching on his brother
and got a suspended sentence.
His brother went to prison.
Where's his brother now?
He killed himself in prison.
Any news?
ALIN:
I spoke with three workers,
but nobody's seen
anything suspicious.
Check this phone number.
He got a text yesterday.
Then we lost track of him.
It's a coded message.
That's all for today.
Hopefully we'll have
better news tomorrow.
ALIN: Goodbye!
Wait for me.
I'm going down
to buy cigarettes.
Hello!
Hello.
(PHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE)
Plant 20g of cocaine
in his hotel room.
Which hotel?
It's in the surveillance file.
Find me a dealer who'll testify
that he bought coke from him.
I need it today, by 4pm.
Between the testimony
and Zsolt's record,
I'll get a search warrant.
We arrest him tomorrow morning.
I won't do it. It's illegal.
I'll take care of the dealer.
But maybe not by 4pm.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Retiring already?
(FOOTSTEPS RETREATING)
Her office is wiretapped.
Meaning?
That's why
she talked to us here.
If you plant the coke
and anyone finds out,
you'll be blamed, not her.
Get it?
Whatever.
Listen.
The message says: "I miss you."
The reply:
"Who are you looking for?"
The answer: "Maria."
The reply: "Wrong number."
Is that a code?
(IN ROMANIAN) A mobile phone
and a five Euro SIM.
(SIGHS) Which mobile?
That one.
- This one?
- Mm-hmm.
How much?
Seventy-two.
(TRAIN HORN BLARING)
Run!
(WOMAN SPEAKING CHINESE)

Hello.
MAN (ON PHONE): Get to
the mattress factory, quickly.
(SIREN WAILING)
(RADIO CHATTER)
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Your partner's waiting for you
in the warehouse.
- Where is it?
- I'll take you.
Someone died?
I saw forensics leaving.
They found a guy
with his throat cut.
Who was it?
Not even the forensics know.
No documents on him.
What did he look like?
I didn't see him.
He was already bagged-up.
Guys, we're going to slip by.
(CAMERA BEEPS, SHUTTER CLICKS)
Where are you going?
OFFICER: I need to escort
this man to the warehouse.
Can't you see
this is a crime scene?
- I'm from narcotics.
- FORENSIC OFFICER: So what?
Don't you know the procedure?
You can go when we're done.
Hi, Cristi.
Hi.
MAN: Let him pass.
But go around the edge.
MAN: You stay there.
First on the left.
- Hi, Cristi.
- CRISTI: Hi.
- CRISTI: Where's Magda?
- Interrogating Zsolt.
Did you plant
the coke in the room?
ALIN: Ten grams.
That's all I found.
The drugs aren't mine.
MAGDA: You have a record.
You'll get at least seven years.
I want to speak to my lawyer.
He's on his way.
But he can't help you.
I haven't done anything.
MAGDA: Where's the 30 million?

(IN SPANISH) Hello!
- (GASPS)
- (GLASS SMASHES)
(IN SPANISH)
Why did you call the police?
- CRISTI (IN ENGLISH): Hey!
- (IN ENGLISH) Shut up!
KIKO: She's the only woman
who knew about the money.
KIKO (PANTING): Sit!
KIKO: Sit fucking down!
(IN SPANISH)
Why did you call the police?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(IN SPANISH) Zsolt and I planned
to run off with the money.
Zsolt was being followed,
so I was supposed
to get the money out.
Did you kill Ortiz?
No.
Zsolt came with someone else
and took the money.
- They killed Ortiz.
- Who was he, you bitch?
I don't know.
Where's the money?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
If I knew that,
I wouldn't be here.
(WAVES CRASHING)
(IN ENGLISH) Imagine yourself
in the middle of an ocean...
and all you can see around
is water.
(BIRDS CALLING)
The water is cold.
The currents are very strong.
Even if you are
a great swimmer...
You don't know you will make it
to the shore.
Can you imagine that?
Yes.
PACO: Besides, you have your
right arm tied to your back.
Do you think
you have any chance?
No.
Zsolt is my right arm.
And you are my left arm.
I need you to free Zsolt.
This is my chance
to get to the shore.
If I can't...
(IN SPANISH) I'm going to sink.
(IN ENGLISH) Along with my arms.
Do you get me?
Yes.
(BIRDS TWEETING)
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(IN SPANISH)
Where's the ashtray?
Give it to me.
I'll throw it away.
You're more beautiful than ever.
Thanks.
How's the whistling going?
Good. He's a fast learner.
Besides that,
is everything good?
Perfect.
Let's go.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Thanks for not telling him
Zsolt and I wanted
to run with the money.
KIKO: If I did, he'd have
killed you on the spot.
Leave me alone.
(GILDA GRUNTS)
(GILDA PANTING)
(GASPS)
Bastard!
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(IN ROMANIAN) The whistling
language reduces Spanish
to two vowels
and four consonants.
These are the whistled vowels
and these are
the Spanish vowels.
The whistled consonants
and the Spanish consonants.
GILDA: Romanian has two
more vowels than Spanish:
"a", which we'll include as "A".
And "î".
We'll include it as "I".
And we have two more consonants:
"t" and "s",
which we'll include as "CH".
GILDA: You got it?
Yes.
GILDA: Let's try it.
"A."
(SHORT, HIGH WHISTLE)

CRISTI: (SHORT, LOW WHISTLE)
(WAVES CRASHING)
(IN SPANISH)
Take care of Cristi,
I'm going to see Paco.
Are you going to
tell him about Zsolt?
Yes.
And about me?
Of course.
CRISTI: At my place,
you mentioned
my mum's gardening obsession.
How did you know?
Paco and I visited her.
We pretended to be a couple,
house-hunting in Romania.
We asked
if she'd sell her house.
Why?
Paco wanted to meet your mother.
To blackmail me?
You want some music?
(OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYS)
What song is this?
I don't know.
It's Zsolt's car.
He listens to opera.

(WHISTLES NORMALLY)
(IN ENGLISH) Wake up, wake up.
Come on.
Today, you have your first
lesson with your new teacher.
You ready?
Sit, monsieur.
Today, you will do your first
word in the whistling language,
which is "Mama."
(TWO LOW PITCH WHISTLES)
But first,
you will do it separately.
"Ma-ma."
(TWO SLOWER LOW PITCH WHISTLES)
(SLOW HIGH WHISTLE,

Not "Mamou."
"Mama."
(TWO SLOW LOW PITCH WHISTLES)
Okay, all together now.

MOTHER: Cristi.
Cristi.
Are you staying for dinner?
No. I'll come
on Saturday, as usual.
(KEYS JINGLING)
I cleaned the cellar yesterday.
I found a bag.
I opened it
and it was full of money.
Did you steal it?
- (SPOON SCRAPING)
- No.
MOTHER: Anyway...
I donated it...
to the church.
What?
I told Father Daniel...
that you'll go to confession.
(TOOLS BANGING)
Where's the money?
FATHER DANIEL: In the bank.
Can't you withdraw it?
(INHALES SHARPLY) Two men from
the fraud squad came today
asking about the money.
I didn't know that banks
had to report
sums over 10,000 euro
to the police.
What did they ask you?
Who made the donation?
If they'd donated before,
what I know about that person?
CRISTI: What did you tell them?
The truth.
That your mother
made the donation
in return for our prayers.
FATHER DANIEL:
She's very worried about you.
You're not married,
you don't have children...
and she suspects
you're a homosexual.
The donation was
for us to pray for your soul,
to cleanse your sins
for you to become normal again.
If you don't want to confess,
tell me as a friend.
What's troubling you?
Why didn't you call me when
my mother brought the money?
I'm going to use the money
to finish the church.
And it will help you,
even if you don't want it to.
Others will pray for you.
FATHER DANIEL: Wait a moment.
FATHER DANIEL:
I have a present for you.
(ENGINE RUMBLING)
If the police come asking
about the money,
tell them
it was your life savings.
That much money?
From Dad.
They know he was
a communist dignitary.
Your father didn't take bribes.
It's a cliché that party bosses
took bribes.
They'll believe you.
Don't be afraid,
nothing is going to happen.
How did you end up like this?
MOTHER:
You were such a good child.
You were so well behaved...
I never thought
you'd end up like this.
MAGDA:
Where did you get the money?
I don't know what you mean.
MAGDA: Who texted you to run?
ZSOLT:
I don't know what you mean.
(PHONE RINGING)
CRISTI: Hi, Mum.
Is something wrong?
Where are you going?
To the market.
- How many cops?
- Two.
Did they give their names?
Yes, but I can't remember.
What did you tell them?
What you told me.
That your father
stole the money.
I said bribes, that's different.
What does it matter?
Did they ask about me?
Yes.
Are you going inside?
No, I'm busy.

hang an icon on?

on the day of the murder.
I printed photos.
Find me the car and the driver.
Let me see.
ALIN: What's he doing?
Covering his face?
MAGDA: Yes. He probably knew
he was being filmed.
ALIN: What are these?
Mattresses?
With 30 million inside.
Who's this man?
I told you, I don't know.
Who do you work for?
Myself.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Cristi. Cristi. Cristi.
Leave him to me.
(CRISTI SIGHS)
(KEYPAD BEEPS, DOOR BUZZES)
Sorry for getting angry.
You almost fooled me.
You're not a bad actor.
I like
to investigate things, too.
What?
I checked his record and...
You were the boss
in Deva back then, right?
Has he changed that much?
You don't recognize him?
He still looks
like a spoiled kid to me.
It crossed my mind,
but I don't remember him.
Enough of the play-acting.
Where did your mother
get 50,000 euro?
I don't think your mother could
take a serious interrogation.
I want you to confess.
Like to a priest.
How long have you
been working for Zsolt?
And who's behind him?
(IN ENGLISH) Two days ago,
I found out that Zsolt tried
to run away with the money.
With my money.
For sure, now he doesn't
want to escape arrest
because he knows
he will face me.
And I'll kill him.
That means that
we need to kidnap him.
I'll think about the plan
to end his days, but
until then...
I wanted to let you know that
Zsolt's share
is for one million.
I want to give it to you.
Thank you.
CRISTI: And Gilda?
Do you want her share too?
CRISTI: No.
What will happen to her?
(SCOFFS) I don't know yet.
She tried to scam me too.
(BIRDS TWEETING)
- Finished?
- Yes.
Okay, let's go.
(ENGINE REVVING)
The plan is simple.
In this vial,
there is a substance
with no color, smell or taste.
You dissolve it
in a glass of water.
Nobody will notice.
You'll give it to Zsolt,
to drink it,
and he will feel sick.
Then, you call for an ambulance,
and he will be taken
to the hospital.
The vial takes effect
within half an hour.
And after that,
within another half hour,
the doctor will have to give him
an injection of cortisone.
Otherwise, he will die.
Any ambulance has cortisone.

Do you mind if I check it out

Yeah, why not. Come in.
It's beautiful.
(MUTED GUNSHOTS)

(IN ENGLISH) Gilda is there.
And Kiko is over there,
in that direction.
You whistle in Romanian
for Gilda.
She whistles
in Spanish for Kiko,
and Kiko whistles back to me.
That way, we check that
the message is correct.
Come on.
PACO: Let's imagine
we are in Bucharest.
PACO:
You gave the vial to Zsolt,
and he was
taken to the hospital.
Now, we are in the hospital.
You whistle
that Zsolt is in room 3,
floor 7,
and he's guarded by two cops.
Instead of my money,
I want you to release Gilda.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Okay. (SCOFFS)
(WHISTLING IN ROMANIAN) Zsolt is

How's things?
MAN: He's different since
he returned from the island.
MAGDA: Different?
MAN: He seems a bit...
withdrawn.
MAN: Distant.
MAN: As though
he's not really here.
(PHONES RINGING IN DISTANCE)
MAGDA: Yes.
Hello.
MAGDA: Hello.
You're back.
Yes.
Thank you. You didn't have to.
Hey.
They're beautiful!
You should put them in water
or they'll dry out.
CRISTI: Any news
while I was away?
ALIN:
We didn't even find the car.
ALIN:
What did you do on the island?
CRISTI:
I learned a whistling language.
ALIN: What for?
CRISTI: So that
you don't understand
what I'm telling them.
16:00 at the Cinematheque
(WATER SPLASHING IN FILM)
MAN (IN FILM): Well,
he was here.
MAN 2: Sure, he was here.
And now they're out there,

Any more orders, captain?

(WHISTLING)
(WHISTLING)
(IN ROMANIAN)
What do you want?
I want to make you an offer.
Ten million euro to get me,
Zsolt and Gilda out of this.
Where's the money?
Zsolt knows.
You're offering
what you don't have?
He has no choice.
Seven years in prison
or being killed by those guys.
He'll choose to live.
Let me think about it.
(MUSIC PLAYING IN FILM)
You can go.
I'll stay to watch the film.
Well, reverend, looks like
you've got yourself surrounded.
Yeah, I figure I'll get myself
un-surrounded.
REVEREND: Woah,
how far's the river?
I've been baptized, reverend.
I've been baptized.
Shut up, you old fool.

yourselves set for another one.
'Cause when I holler, I want
you to move out of here!

Take Zsolt for interrogation.
Get him to make a statement
saying that
it was the first time
he worked with them.
At first, he liked the idea.
When he realized
it was drug money
his conscience
started to bother him.
MAN: Good day.
Hi.
He remembered
his brother's suicide
and decided
to turn against them.
So, he'll become an informer
and go free.
See you in an hour,
with the statement.
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)
MAGDA: Let's go!
Tomorrow, after the hospital,
bring them here.
Tell them that you buried
the money. I'll show you where.
(CROW CAWING)
MAGDA: Remember the way.
MAGDA: First left,
then first right.
ZSOLT: What is this place?
MAGDA: A movie set.
It's not credible that
I hid the money here.
Why not? It's abandoned.
I arrested the owner.
(CROW CAWING)
MAGDA: Tell them you buried it
under this hay.
MAGDA: Got it?
ZSOLT: Yeah.
(WHISTLING) Gilda.
(WHISTLING) Gilda.
(GILDA WHISTLING) Cristi.
I'll give the vial to Zsolt
tomorrow at 9 am.
(IN SPANISH) Tomorrow at 9 am.
Perfect.
Say goodbye.
(WHISTLING) Goodbye.
Tomorrow
at 09:00.
(WHISTLING) Got it.
Why is it taking so long?
It should have worked by now.
(SIREN WAILING)
(WHISTLING) The name
of the hospital is Colentina.
(IN SPANISH) The name
of the hospital is Colentina.
MAGDA:
I'll chain you to the bed,
so your friends don't wonder
why you're not guarded.
Tell them he's handcuffed
and to bring bolt-cutters.
Got it.
(WHISTLING) Tell them
to release you now.
GILDA (IN SPANISH):
He says to release me now.
We'll pay when we have Zsolt.
That one.
MAGDA: Him?
CRISTI: I know him.
CRISTI: His name is Felipe.
MAGDA: And this one?
CRISTI: I don't know him.
We could've arrested them here.
You think this is the wild west?
What if they start
shooting patients?
Cristi, come with me.
You stay here and clear up.

(SHOWER RUNNING)
Put the knife down!
Kick it towards me.
(PHONE RINGING)
Answer.
- It's not my phone.
- GILDA: Whose is it?
It belongs to the cop
who's following you.
Answer.
GILDA: Put it on loudspeaker.
MAGDA: Listen carefully.
Cristi escaped. I think
he's heading to the motel.
I sent a team.
I'll be straight over.
Can you hear me?
Alin!
Alin, can you hear me?
The money is in two mattresses.
One for me and Zsolt
and one for you and the cop.
Deal?
I'll get the car.
We have no time.

- (IN ROMANIAN) Good day.
GILDA: I saw the sign.
I'm interested in the house.
Of course. Come in.
MOTHER: This is the garden.
I know.
I was here last year
with my husband.
MOTHER: That's right.
I didn't recognize you.
You were with that gentleman
from Spain.
How is he?
We broke up.
What a shame.
It's a shame when you break up.
Why are you selling?
My son has problems.
Problems?
He was hit by a car
and never recovered.
What do you mean?
He can't speak.
And he's a bit crazy.
The doctor says he isn't,
but I think he is.
He suddenly starts whistling.
The policeman guarding him
says so.
He starts whistling
and won't stop.
That's why
I'm selling the house.
To take him to a clinic abroad.
The police guard him?
All the time.
(WHISPERS)
He got himself in deep trouble.
(WHISPERS) With gangsters.
(WHISPERS)
They might try to kill him.
Why are you whispering?
So my friend doesn't hear.
She was his boss.
She said not to tell anyone
what happened.
- Magda!
- MAGDA: Yes.
Can you make
an extra cup of coffee?
Someone's here to see the house.
MAGDA: Right away.
- Which hospital is your son in?
- Aslan.
He'll be out in a month.
So I want to sell quickly.
Please, come in.
I forgot something in the car.
I'll be right back.
MAGDA: The coffee is ready.
MAGDA: Where's the visitor?
She went to
the car for something.
MOTHER: She came a year ago
with her Spanish husband.
MAGDA: Her husband is Spanish?
MOTHER: Not anymore,
they broke up.
