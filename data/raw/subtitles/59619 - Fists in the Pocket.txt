"Dear Lucia: Now I'm positive
that I'm expecting Augusto's child.
That makes me
his only real girlfriend."
What nonsense!
"You're just a pastime for him.
Leave him - for your own good."
What an idiot!
It was Giulia.
I knew it.
Why'd you show it to your mother?
You could have asked me first.
Living with them is bad enough,
let alone taking you there.
May I pull out now?
I can't afford a place in town.
It's too expensive.
What's so hard to understand?
Here.
And don't confuse reverse
with fourth this time.
Just be quiet
and keep an eye out.
I'm quite prepared...
to make any sacrifice,
but not for a lost cause.
Lucia, please.
Let's not start again.
When your sister
writes me a letter like that -
There's no point harping on it.
When someone threatens me like that,
what am I to do?
Get to the point.
What do you want?
I'll see you later.
Cut it out!
She's a poor virgin
come to make her confession
Send her in!
I'll hear her sins
The brakes!
I told you there was gravel
on the road.
I've told you a thousand times:
I feed the rabbits.
No need to be so rude.
They're not even yours.
They are too.
Keeping rabbits was my idea.
Go water the flowers.
I'm gonna tell Augusto
when he gets back.
Go on and tell, tattle-tale.
- Why didn't you stop?
- Close the door.
- Are you angry?
- What were you doing out there?
Waiting for you.
I like riding with you. Is that a crime?
You shouldn't be out alone.
If something happened,
who would help you?
Those two buzzed around me
for half an hour.
You're pleased with yourself.
Guess what.
Ale left a poem on my dresser.
A love poem to me.
Did Giulia say anything about me?
You don't really believe her, do you?
What did you say?
Everyone says I'm a beauty
I am the queen of love
Everyone says I'm a star
Shining in splendor above
Be a good boy, Leone.
Try to remember.
What sound do horses make?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
Come on.
What about donkeys?
Dinner's ready.
They bray.
And oxen?
Augusto's here, Mama.
May the Lord bless this food
and keep us in his holy ways.
- One or two?
- Two.
Stop that!
Eat properly!
Nervous, eh?
Just a bit on edge.
Stop it.
Let go.
Stop it!
Ale, could you cut my meat?
Take it.
- Cards?
- I don't feel like it.
Come into the den.
Would you like to read the poem?
I wrote this for your own good.
I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.
I've told you a thousand times:
I just want to be left alone.
Is that asking too much?
Keep your emotional outbursts
to yourselves
and let me work.
Keep your nose out of my business.
Understand?
Yes, I understand.
Sure you do.
I don't want to hear
another word about Ale's poetry.
Now get going.
I said get out.
- What did you tell him?
- Everything. You'll see.
That was stupid.
Why is it, at your age,
that you have no ambition?
Nice clothes
or a little pocket money -
those would be modest ambitions,
but better than nothing.
Stop spying on each other,
reading each other's diary.
Why don't you try
and learn something?
You can't even type.
You haven't touched
the bicycle I bought you.
Just go away.
It's pointless trying to talk to you.
All you've managed to do
is take off Leone's bandage
when the doctor said not to.
Why did you take it off?
You're like a bunch of animals!
Watch out,
'cause someday I'll get fed up.
And I've told you before:
Don't wear my shirts!
- So you showed him my poem.
- Yes. What about it?
Your phone was busy for half an hour.
Who was it?
Jealous?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm really down.
Try to understand.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Is that the TVin the background?
Do you love me?
Why don't we get together now?
I'll come over.
No, I'm not crazy.
I can be there in half an hour.
Wait for me. Bye.
Hey, it's 11:00.
My lesson.
My father sent along
some apples for you.
It's 11:00.
My lesson.
- Put them down.
Turn off that record!
Get my slippers.
The window.
Did you get your report card?
And?
- I flunked.
Cretin! Imbecile!
Beast! Ass! Idiot!
This is what I get for trying to pound
some knowledge into that thick head?
Go and dig the fields.
"O sun, you who rise joyful and free,
tame your horses upon our hills."
Let's see this report card.
You gotta change these grades.
But it must be done very carefully.
No fancy stuff.
It takes a very light touch.
Give me a pen.
Meanwhile,
here's an assignment for you.
A nice little composition entitled
"What I see on the terrace."
Go out on the terrace,
have a look,
come back,
and tell me exactly what you saw.
All right? Now go.
Look. I changed
your grade in math and art.
See anything interesting?
On the terrace
your sister, Miss Giulia,
was sunbathing.
Very good.
Let's explore this subject
for a while.
Describe Miss Giulia.
On the terrace, Miss Giulia
was sunbathing on the terrace.
Try to be more specific.
Can you remember,
for instance,
what position she was in?
I believe she was sitting down.
You remember
how she was dressed?
No, I don't.
You're going to go back out there.
This time
get as close as possible
and observe carefully.
Then come back and tell me
everything you saw.
Meanwhile,
I'll finish your report card.
All right.
Did you get up close?
Well?
Congratulations.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
The ink bottle.
Pour it.
Pour.
What are you doing?
You idiot.
What's wrong with you?
What do I do now?
"What do I do now?"
"You made your bed.
Now lie in it."
"As you sow, so shall you reap."
Did you study
when I begged and entreated you,
when I went hoarse
trying to teach you?
Dig deep into your conscience
and see who's to blame.
You got what you deserved.
Good-bye.
Every Sunday when I went
To church, my prayers to say
A youth of heavenly beauty
Sandrino.
Would you read me the newspaper?
Where is it?
Don't you see it?
Look around.
It has to be here.
Do you mind?
- No, Mama. Why should I mind?
What?
Are you talking to yourself?
I feel a draft.
Is the window open?
It's closed.
I found the newspaper.
What should I read?
Would you be so kind
as to read me who died?
Who died.
Let's see.
Zerpani, Luisa.
Cavalli, Giambattista.
Paracioppi, Gustavo.
Saraceno, Elisabetta.
Anyone you know?
No, no one.
And births?
No births,
no weddings, no graduations.
What else should I read?
Anything.
But what?
I can't read the whole paper.
I'll read some headlines
and you stop me.
"Signalman crushed by moving train.
Was he drunk?
Impossible to determine for certain."
How sad.
Premeditated matricide.
Son kills mother
for making him take a bath.
Good grief.
Retired married couple
commit suicide by turning on the oven.
He was 68.
She was 53.
Same age as me.
What an awful day.
Isn't there any happier news?
The king of England died,
leaving in the darkest despair
and desperation -
- But there's the queen.
- Precisely.
As always.
I'm so unhappy.
What's wrong?
Would you like some candy?
Open up!
Open up!
Learn some manners.
Just a minute.
Quick!
Put a handkerchief between his teeth
or he'll bite his tongue.
Hurry up, you idiot!
- How?
You're suffocating him!
Let me do it!
I'll call the doctor.
The doctor was out.
Let's put him on the table.
Give me a hand.
Gently.
Laugh.
That'll make him furious.
Are you done?
Can't I talk to Augusto?
That's enough.
I said that's enough!
Come here!
Let me go!
Get out of here!
I've had it with you two!
Look what you did to my face!
She's hitting me!
Get out of here!
I can't take much more of this.
Stop butting in!
Sandro, what's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?
Mr. Sandro,
what happened to your face?
My face! My face!
My God!
Where's Ale?
Just look at him.
Staring in the mirror
instead of cooling off his head.
Shame on you.
There.
Stay down there.
It'll do you good.
I can't breathe!
Just try to imagine
if you were on your own...
without the four of us.
For the first time in your life,
you could think of yourself.
Tell me man to man:
Why should you let us
poison your whole life?
And I'm including myself.
I really care for you, Augusto.
You're the only one I care for.
That's why I want you to be free.
And I think I just came up
with a way.
Want some milk?
Look at this.
Can I get my driver's license?
Are you crazy?
They'd never allow it.
Have you lost your mind?
I haven't had an attack in a year.
I've been fine since I started
taking my pills regularly.
I'm in full control.
Some control.
Just last month you -
I was faking. I swear.
So I wouldn't have to go
into town with Leone.
Great.
I should have known.
What's past is past.
I'll get right to the point.
Every year on All Souls' Day,
we've all gone to the cemetery.
And you've driven us there.
This year I'll drive.
You really think
I'd be that irresponsible?
- Exactly.
- Exactly what? Explain yourself.
At the Barberino curve,
I'll drive us all off the cliff.
What's so funny?
Don't tell me
you never thought about it.
Hi, Augusto.
How are you?
Everything all right?
What's your hurry?
- The usual place?
- Where else?
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?
Something came up
at the last minute.
You forgot to signal.
I'm sorry.
Otherwise you did well.
Don't take it too hard.
A month will fly by.
- Let's go.
- All right.
I lied this morning.
The test was today,
and I passed.
Congratulations.
If I'd told you in advance,
I'd have felt like you were there,
and the responsibility
would have weighed on me,
with all the money you've spent.
May I ask a favor?
- Go ahead.
You're supposed to drive us
to the cemetery today.
You do it for Mama's sake,
but I know it's a bother.
I could drive them
and give you the afternoon free.
You know how to back up?
Of course.
- Can you change a tire?
- I'll show you.
No, I believe you.
Very well.
But drive slowly.
- Please close the door.
- I'm coming right back.
Hello, boys.
Sandro, please close the door.
Mama, Sandro passed
his driving test.
- Really? When?
- This morning.
He must be so happy.
I kept praying
he'd just give up on the idea.
Hey there.
- Sorry.
- I have to get by.
Here are some towels.
Did you really pass
your driving test?
I don't believe it.
- Sorry I'm late.
- I hear you did very well.
I'm happy.
Congratulations, Ale.
Let's eat.
Ale asked me if he could
drive you all to the cemetery.
I trust him,
and it's a chance for him
to make himself useful.
And I could take care
of some other things.
You're not going?
You always drive,
and today suddenly Ale's driving.
I'm supposed to trust Ale.
Unless you drive, I'm not budging.
- He knows how to drive.
- I don't care. I'm staying home.
All right, Ale.
You'll take Leone and Mama.
If Giulia won't go, it's her loss.
I'll take them,
but they all have to come.
Including Giulia.
- But how?
- You can persuade her.
She likes you
and does whatever you ask.
She has to come along,
like it or not.
I assure you:
You won't be sorry this time.
Why?
It's a surprise.
Dear Augusto,
you've always underestimated me.
But this time
I'll keep my promise.
Everyone ready?
Don't do anything stupid.
Comfortable?
Be careful, you hear?
Remember your signals
and handbrake, and drive slowly.
I left a note on the table.
Read it when you have time.
What about?
Just things.
I'll get rid of everyone
for you today, including myself.
I failed the driving test.
I had to lie to get the car.
From one man to another:
Good-bye.
I'd like to be cremated.
Come on!
Watch out!
Go!
- Ale, I'm afraid!
- Go!
I'm afraid!
Slow down, please!
Come on, you can do it!
I forgot.
That car made me lose my head.
This is a good spot,
but I wasn't prepared.
Did you say something?
Mama wants to know
why we stopped.
We stopped because we stopped,
all right?
Hey there. How are you?
- Coming in?
- What for?
We forgot water
for the flowers.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
I'm falling!
Let's all say a requiem together.
- Why don't you want to?
- Because I don't.
- Yes!
- No!
- At least take off your sweater.
- And then?
You always end up taking it off.
Why make me ask for half an hour?
I end up begging,
like you're doing me a favor.
Where are you going?
Stay here.
I don't know
why you get so offended.
All right. I'm sorry.
It's been one of those days.
Read this
and tell me if I'm not entitled.
And you just sit there?
Do something.
- You don't really think he'd do it!
Wait for me, Ale.
Where are you going?
Wait for me.
When you raced with that car,
I wasn't afraid at all.
You were a maniac.
I felt like I was driving too.
I really wanted you
to pass him.
Why did you stop?
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
Is it an attack?
It's just one of those days.
I made my mind up
about a lot of things,
but then I changed my mind
and went back on my decisions.
But now, come hell or high water,
I'm absolutely determined.
Please, Augusto.
You want me to sit down?
Is that better now?
Why so afraid? Whatever was gonna
happen has already happened.
What's this nonsense?
I was just joking.
They could be back any minute.
We'll hear the car.
Are you crazy?
I don't like this.
What don't you like?
I don't know. The way you're talking.
My mind is racing.
Are you imagining
the same thing I am?
Come on, tell the truth.
That must be them.
Get off the bed.
I'm glad they're back.
I was starting to think -
If they hadn't returned,
would you feel responsible?
Responsible for what?
Let's get things straight here.
Then why did you let yourself go?
Let myself go?
You obviously don't know me very well.
You were dreaming,
just like I was.
The lights, Leone.
- Are you crazy?
- Look what he writes!
"I'd like to be cremated."
You little jerk!
Aren't you ashamed
to show your face?
Stop laughing and get up!
Are you sick or what?
- Hey.
- What?
You knew this
and still allowed me to go?
Stop laughing.
You'll make him mad.
- That's the surprise you promised me?
- What surprise?
Idiot!
What torture, living in this house.
All by yourself, just like that,
you decided for all of us?
That was a narrow escape.
That's why
you wanted me along too.
You didn't do it, but to think
you could even conceive of it!
Giulia, listen.
Out of my way.
'Raus!
Come on.
- Someone's coming.
- Don Luigi?
Of course not.
Don't you hear it?
Yes, I know him.
- You do?
- It's Sandro, from the villa.
- They're all crazy out there.
- Quiet, idiot! He'll hear you.
You're the idiot.
What do we do now?
Come on, let's go.
"Condemned to spend
your youthful years
in this uncivilized hamlet."
How much do I need
to raise them professionally?
I can help you raise them,
but I've got no money.
How much would it take?
At least three or four million.
You have that much?
I'll stop by tomorrow evening
and let you know.
All right.
All right, but why breeding?
You even forget to feed
your four rabbits.
Why don't you learn
to make business cards instead?
I saw it in today's paper.
Ten lire per card
for drawing one flower.
Some people earn
10,000 lire a day.
Your enterprise
would mean taking on debt,
which I have no desire to do.
Mama alone costs
three million a year.
Between you and me,
if we didn't have her -
But we do,
and I just couldn't put her in a home.
We don't get public assistance,
you know.
Are you ready?
Did you make a shopping list?
- It's in my bag.
Let's go, then.
- Augusto's here too.
- Don't look at him.
Stop looking.
- You know the others?
- Probably his friends.
Stop it.
Is Lucia there too?
- What if she is?
- Why are they laughing?
That's their business.
What will you have?
- Yes?
- A vermouth.
- Red or dry?
- What?
- Red or dry?
- Dry.
Ma'am?
Two dry vermouths.
Don't wait for me.
I'm getting a ride.
Did you get everything?
- Yes, we're all done.
- You need gas?
- No, we've got plenty.
All right. Tell Mama
I'll be home for supper.
And drive slowly, please.
I'm coming.
I suddenly feel hot.
I'll ride with Sandra.
You go ahead.
Let's go.
Lucia wouldn't tell us
who you were talking to.
To the right!
Look at that fat one!
To the right!
Come on.
I'm going to the bathroom.
You can take your time.
Ready?
Did you make up your mind?
He looked.
I knew it.
I win.
That's enough sugar, Leone.
How did you think of that?
You're the one who said
he was better.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I know, and that's enough.
What are you going to do?
- I guess I'll take a bath.
Is that you, Ale?
Sorry, Mama.
It slipped my mind.
Have you been waiting long?
If you're busy,
we can go another day.
Why would I be busy?
Want to come to the cemetery?
No. See you tonight.
Enjoy your bath.
I'm so sorry I kept you waiting.
- It doesn't matter.
You'll see.
We'll be back in no time.
Put me in the front seat.
And please don't upset me.
Let me enjoy the ride.
Have you got the money or not?
We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
All right, but stay in touch, okay?
All set?
Thanks, and have a good drive.
- Who was that?
- Tonino.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Ale, please open
the window a little.
Of course. You get carsick.
I'm sorry.
Should we stop a while?
It's no problem.
Yes, maybe we should.
I can get some fresh air.
- Of course.
We have all the time
in the world.
- Where are we?
- San Salvatore.
Don't get too close.
It's dangerous.
I'm sorry,
but you'd better guide me.
Please, where can I sit down?
Come and sit on the wall.
Go ahead.
You can do it.
Ale, help me.
Where did you go?
- Keep going.
- Where are you?
Where's the wall? Where are you?
- I'm right here.
Ale, please help me.
Please, Ale, help me.
Help me sit down.
Blessed mother, pray for her...
Park over there.
"Knock and it shall be
opened unto you."
- What are these?
- Mourning cards.
You have to choose one.
- You decide.
This house was never as lively
as it is now - for a funeral.
Many happy returns.
- Come on, Sandro.
Lucia really knows her way
around a kitchen.
She makes great coffee.
How can you talk
about coffee now?
I was just paying Lucia
a compliment.
Why don't you go sit with Mama?
Giulia must be tired.
I'm on my way.
Tonight we could leave her alone.
She's not going anywhere.
We'll see. Now go.
- Coffee's ready.
- I'll take it.
Would you care for coffee?
Take one.
Go ahead.
Forgive me,
but are you in or out?
Let's discuss it another time.
With chinchillas,
if we wait, we'll lose the first litter.
Then let's forget it.
I don't know. I'm all confused.
I can't think straight.
Is it the money,
or have you lost interest?
Tonino, even you must see
this isn't the proper time.
My mother -
- Forget I mentioned it.
Leone, go on.
I'll stay here.
Let me help you.
Everything will be all right.
Are you crazy?
Ah, Leone.
Come in.
Don't be afraid.
Do you need something?
Want some coffee?
Lucia, make him some coffee.
Say something, for God's sake.
Want me to dry?
What is it?
If you want to go, I'll stay.
How do you feel?
How do you think I feel?
Excuse me, Sisters, but this is
our last chance to be alone
with our poor mother.
Why did you send them away?
Because.
You always want
to look important.
Are you sorry Mama's dead?
What a question.
Well, are you all right,
or aren't you?
I'm restless, all mixed up,
full of ideas.
Aren't you?
Certainly. It's a great opportunity,
and everyone wants to take advantage.
Did you see how helpful
Augusto was being?
What's on your mind?
Do you even have to ask?
I'm a volcano of ideas.
Are you crazy?
I'll bet Augusto thinks
he can get married now
and move into town.
Too bad
he'll have to stay here.
Please, Ale.
Come back down to earth.
He's the one who gives orders here.
True.
But I'm no longer under his spell.
Can't I say so?
You can say what you like,
for all I care.
The way he was bossing
Lucia around today...
as if we were all half-wits.
- What good is talking about it?
- Doesn't it hurt?
What good is talking about it?
Can't you see
he's taking advantage
of Mama's death?
- And why shouldn't he?
- Why shouldn't he?
Whoever has a plan
will take advantage.
You have no plans,
so you'll just look on.
He'll profit from this because
he's the only one who wants something.
- Let's get something straight here.
- By all means.
Go ahead and snicker.
You think Mama died by accident?
I killed her.
With these hands,
despite my fears.
I risk life imprisonment
for the family's benefit,
while he, like a thief,
suddenly becomes "big brother."
He brings in Lucia
and has her serve coffee,
and he'll walk off
with the fortune I made!
This little brain of mine...
that you didn't trust an inch
planned the whole thing.
My head!
Giulia, hold my head!
I'll come around.
Quiet or they'll hear us.
That's a good boy.
Go away.
Lean on me.
Come lie down on the bed.
Are you going to tell?
Are you going to tell?
Tell me how it happened.
Be a good boy
and keep your voice down,
or the devil
will come and get you.
If you wish to say
a last farewell to your poor mother,
do so before we close the lid
on this gentlest and
most grief-stricken of mothers.
No one's closer to us
than our mother.
"No one can take the place
of a mother," says an old proverb.
This woman,
destined by divine providence
to have her faith and Christian patience
tried by lifelong misfortune -
at least now she can
look down upon you from above.
I wouldn't have
the courage to kiss her.
Unfortunately, nature
makes exceptions for nobody.
Yet "divine patience is omnipotent."
But that's another sermon.
A fur coat.
Look, Mama's fur coat.
There's nobody here anymore
who's blind!
Where should we put it?
That's the first and last time
you sleep outside.
And in a stable!
That's not even proper.
Why don't we move away?
What a brilliant idea.
There's something
I have to tell you.
Here we go.
Just a second.
I would save these magazines.
This collection might be valuable.
What do you want to do
with Mama's room?
Let's hear it.
It's just that I'm getting married,
and it seemed advisable -
or rather, necessary - that I tell you.
Giulia, come sit here
so he only has to look in one place.
If that's all,
it's fine with me.
And I'm sure
Giulia would have no -
Although I hardly know Lucia,
we'll all get along well together.
Perhaps you didn't understand.
I meant we're planning
to get an apartment in town.
I'll split my time
between here and there.
Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday in town,
and the rest here.
Even a small apartment
costs money.
This is a bit awkward,
but Mama's death
eliminates certain expenses.
Exactly - the three million
you promised me.
I assumed you'd forgotten
about that.
How would you use it?
- I'll tell you.
When?
Tomorrow.
Remember Uncle Giuseppino?
Here we go!
Ale, be careful!
How am I doing so far?
Fine.
I'm just afraid that sooner or later
you're going to tell him,
simply out of vanity.
Certainly I'll tell him.
Problem is, I've lost the desire
to raise chinchillas.
I'm bursting with energy.
I have to channel it
into something.
We have lots of work ahead.
We'll empty the attic,
clean the house. We'll be busy.
But for how long?
I loved the chinchillas.
I swear.
I'd dream about them at night.
You missed me.
Some of this stuff is still good.
They're burning everything.
If it weren't for me -
Mama's glasses are all charred.
Look at this thing.
The pot we cooked eggs in.
This is burning hot.
Enough!
What's wrong with you?
You got the devil inside you?
- Am I a good lover?
- You'll learn.
We said 3,000.
I'm putting it here
on the table, okay?
Have you known Augusto long?
Years.
- Is he good?
- Certainly better than you.
No doubt.
He's been doing it for years.
Does he visit you often?
- Three or four times a month.
In this bed?
What is this, an inquisition?
Come on.
This bed or another one -
whatever's available.
- How many years?
- I already told you. Weren't you listening?
Here we go again.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Where have you been
for half an hour?
With a whore.
She's coming up ahead.
There.
- Which one?
There.
- The one in red?
- Yes. Did you get a good look?
You went with her?
To bed?
Go back around.
I want a better look.
The train!
- Here we are.
- Go slow.
Take a good look.
I'm not circling back again.
You recognize her?
Not bad, is she?
What do you think?
Will you go back again?
Why wasn't I invited?
Sandro didn't want it.
Ask him.
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Who told you?
He's lying.
How do I look?
So you're going?
I'll tell you about it afterwards.
I wasn't invited.
Neither was I.
Giulia, watch Leone.
Call me if anything happens.
What could happen?
Leone, do something.
Can't you see they're leaving?
Sandro, I beg you,
don't do anything silly,
and remember to wish Lucia
a happy birthday.
Remember your manners.
Hi, how are you?
Good evening.
And above all, no drinking.
Is that clear?
- How do I look?
- Fine.
- Look my way occasionally.
- Of course.
Couldn't you go around
the other way?
This is Alessandro.
Happy birthday.
Don't we look nice tonight.
So chic.
What a crowd.
I hardly know anyone.
I'll introduce you around.
Hey there.
Look, there's Sandro.
Got a cigarette?
Where did we leave off?
Ah, right - at Hobbes's theory:
Homo homini lupus,
which means that man
acts like a wolf towards other men.
And what about women?
You disappoint me.
Can you really be
that narrow-minded?
Women are incidental in philosophy.
Remember what Thomas Aquinas said
in his Summa Theologica.
Are you new here?
Yes. I'm Augusto's brother.
Ah, Lucia's fiancé?
What do you do?
It's a bit unusual.
Come and sit here.
Are you always alone like this?
Shall we dance?
I don't really feel like it.
- Shall we dance?
- I don't know how.
- I'll teach you.
- Fine, if you'll teach me.
Come on, then.
- How do you do it?
- Like this.
- Where are you going?
- We have to talk.
- Is this wood?
- I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
Do you like my friends?
Yes. They're friendly people
that you can talk to.
Would you like to live in town?
Sure. It's a lot of fun here.
But I'd need something to do.
I'm not against your marriage,
even if Augusto thinks I am.
We all have our own lives.
It's just that,
financially speaking -
- Here you are.
- We were talking about you.
Somebody's looking for you.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
Great. Enjoy yourself.
I had no luck.
But she'd go with you. Honest.
She keeps asking for you.
I like how you said,
"I can't dance. All right, teach me."
There she is. See ya.
- No, don't go.
- Why?
- Stay here.
- See ya.
Shall we dance?
My brother's waiting for me.
I should go.
Give me your telephone number.
No, but you can always
find me on the main boulevard.
See you around.
Wait -
The car isn't ready.
- Want more coffee?
- No, it doesn't matter.
- Take mine.
- No, thanks.
- I'll leave some.
- Fine.
And now let's go paint.
What's wrong, Ale?
Are you angry about the car?
It's annoying.
I shaved for nothing.
- You can go into town tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
I'll have to shave again.
You know how hard it is.
Won't you come paint?
You go.
I'll come later.
I need to take
a walk by myself.
I could tell.
May I come in?
Get out of there.
What are you doing?
Come out here.
What are you doing?
Let me give you a buggy ride.
Here he comes!
Where were you?
I was where I was.
What's wrong?
I feel depressed and useless.
You can't be depressed
just 'cause you shaved.
Apparently I can.
How can I tire myself out?
The thought of painting
is too depressing today.
Stop it, Leone!
You're messing up the floor!
Leone needs a bath.
I'll get it ready for him.
I'll go if you want.
Finish up here
before I get back.
We should call it a day.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm glad.
Take off your shoes.
Now, Leone,
while I prepare your bath,
you go get a big towel,
some underwear,
some socks and an undershirt.
Leave your shoes in the kitchen
and put on your slippers.
Get your bottle of yellow pills
and a glass.
Go on now.
Now get undressed.
How many do you take?
- One.
Drink this.
Better not lock the door.
If anything happened,
who would help you?
Go.
Five... six...
seven... eight...
nine... ten.
What's wrong?
What is it, Ale?
We forgot all about Leone.
You gonna spend
your whole life in the tub?
What's wrong?
Did you fall asleep?
What's wrong?
What should we do now?
Just wait.
Her condition is stable for now.
Stable?
That's all you can say?
Just wait and hope
things turn out well.
But you must have
some prognosis.
Sandro, I'm not a magician.
But you must have an opinion -
either there's hope or there isn't.
You have to tell me something.
She could live or die
or end up paralyzed.
Hear that?
Be quiet!
Get out of here!
I told you he'd get mad.
But what are her chances?
Can't you tell me that?
- It wouldn't change anything.
- It would for me!
What should we do?
You're breathing.
You're alive.
Just when things
were starting to work out.
When we might have
started inviting people.
Giulia may live or die
or be paralyzed
and a burden to us for 30 years.
Right back where we started.
You're right to want to leave,
to sell this place.
Giulia's awake and asking for you.
Giulia, can you hear me?
Are you alive?
Can you feel your legs?
How about your arms?
Everything's working.
- Stop it.
What's wrong?
We can pick up where we left off,
just like before.
You know Leone's dead, right?
Aren't you glad?
You're crying? Why?
- Because you don't love me.
- I don't?
But I do.
- Sorry. The door was open.
- Come in.
Have you seen how neat everything is?
Lucia's marvelous.
Yes, she's very efficient.
A real dynamo.
Thank you for being
so understanding
about me and Lucia.
Listen, Augusto.
It's time we spoke frankly.
- Can you believe it?
- What?
My wife and kids
are supposed to live here?
I knew you'd say that.
He's thought of every angle.
You understand?
- What angles?
He'll leave you and Lucia alone
because he can't get along without you.
I'll turn him in.
Let me finish.
Relax.
If anyone should be
afraid here, it's me.
- What are you saying?
- It's true. I know him.
Besides, if you turned him in,
they wouldn't believe you.
There's no evidence.
And you won't get
a word out of me.
For him to dream, to get excited,
he needs active people around him,
people who don't need help.
Above all,
they mustn't be incurables.
Let's stick together.
You and me.
- Of course.
Don't be afraid.
Just do what you've always done.
It'll be all right.
I'm leaving.
Okay. See you.
See you.
If you need anything, just tell me.
Giulia, are you asleep?
Sleep well.
Everything's working out
for the best.
Sleep, sleep.
And tomorrow -
Help me!
Help me!
Giulia, hold my head!
