Today we're going to talk
about the stomach.
As I was saying, today we're
going to talk about the stomach.
The stomach is the sack-like
enlargement of the alimentary canal.
Positioned between the
oesophagus and duodenum.
It looks like a curved sack with
a conclavity facing the right...
called the small curvature.
And a conclavity facing the left.
- Admit it, you stole the hand.
- Stop it.
You're such a boffin you
took it home to study it.
You need quite a sense of humour
to laugh in an anatomy lab...
or none at all,
and I think that applies to you.
- The lesson's over, you can go.
- Sorry, professor.
- It's most disturbing, professor.
- It's the second time it's happened.
Perhaps there's a maniac here
amongst us in the hospital.
- We should inform the police.
- I know what they're like.
If they get involved we'll end up
finding them in the operating theatre.
Frankly, I don't know what to think.
Something like this would make
sense in a society of savages...
or in medieval times,
but in New York, today?
Do you really think we're
so different?
Perhaps not.
This is the anthropological research
you asked for, Professor Stafford.
I'm sorry it's late,
and even if it isn't perfect...
but I haven't been in the
best of spirits lately.
- You're not feeling well?
- No, it isn't that.
Don't worry, Lori.
I'm sure it's fine, as usual.
Well, what is it?
- Tell me.
- Strange things have been happening.
Pieces of corpses have been
disappearing from the hospital.
It's probably a student who wants
to further their studies in private.
Perhaps.
It's nothing serious.
Leave me at the next corner,
there's a restaurant there...
and thanks for the ride.
At your service, Lori.
- Here?
- Yes.
I had no idea you were a vegetarian.
I don't come here often, but after
an anatomy lesson you'd understand.
Goodbye, and don't hesitate
to call if you need me.
You know anthropology
is my greatest passion.
Goodbye, Lori.
He had just died.
I went to call the shift doctor,
not even ten minutes, and then...
They've removed his heart.
It must be a lunatic,
a very dangerous individual.
Not a word to anyone.
What do you want?
Who are you?
Susan Kelly, New York Express.
May I come in?
- Sorry, but I'm on my way out.
- This won't take a minute.
Do you mind telling me
what you want?
Just some clarifications,
or rather...
some information on the mysterious
activities at your hospital.
- Cases of cannibalism, I hear.
- Where did you hear that nonsense?
I sniff news out of the air
rather than hear it with my ears.
Your nose has let you down,
there's no mystery.
- You don't want to talk about it.
- Listen, I'm in a hurry.
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- At this hour?
- Something strange?
- You're never on duty at this hour.
- I've done my research.
- I'm covering a sick colleague.
Why all the exotic objects?
Aside from a medical degree,
I also have one in anthropology.
- What's that?
- It's a sacrificial weapon, satisfied?
If you'll excuse me.
Turan!
Get him!
It isn't possible.
- Who would have thought it?
- Let's call the police.
What happened?
Tu ran, why?
Kito ordered it.
He only uttered a few words.
"Kito, ordered it."
And nothing more, Mr. Chandler.
It doesn't help to shed much
light on what happened.
"Kito"...
It doesn't mean anything to me.
But it does to me.
It's a word that was common to all the
ancient dialects of Southeast Asia.
What does it mean?
It means "Divine island",
or something similar.
This word, "Kito", wasn't it also used
in the Moluccan archipelago?
Exactly.
We've managed to ascertain that
the orderly originated from there.
So, one of the Moluccan islands
may have something to do with this.
Perhaps.
I imagine you know a great deal
more about these people.
Enough.
I may have to borrow your assistant,
professor Drydock, only temporarily.
Not a hope, Mr. Chandler.
I want to show you something.
Did they practice cannibalism
in the Moluccan islands?
All primitive populations
practiced it, without exception.
In all probability the orderly
was an anthropophagus; a cannibal.
Similar cases have also been
reported in other cities.
That's why the Department
of Health is handling it.
Start the slides, George.
Until now we've been able
to keep this a secret.
This is the documentation we have
on some recent cases of cannibalism.
They're not a pleasant sight.
- This is the latest one.
- Stop!
Can you enlarge it?
That's the only anthropophagus
we've been able to capture.
We caught him eating the heart of a
woman who'd died in a car accident.
It's unbelievable.
Unfortunately we weren't
able to question him.
He reacted so violently that the
police were forced to kill him.
- He looks Asian as well.
- Yes, that's right.
And now I'm convinced he also
came from the Moluccan islands.
There's a link between the
hospital orderly and that man.
Did you see the tattoo on their chest?
It's the same.
And from what I know it's the symbol
of a sect in the Moluccan islands.
Professor Stafford might know more.
- Can you arrange an appointment?
- Certainly.
If her interpretation of
the word "Kito" is correct...
there's only one detail
I'd like to stress.
It's also the name of the island where
their god, Kito, supposedly lived.
Hold on.
This is the symbol of the Kito sect.
- Did they make sacrifices to this god?
- Unfortunately, yes, human sacrifices.
Thank you, professor.
The professor was quite exhaustive.
Of course, he's the leading expert
on anthropology in the United States.
At this point, he's told us
what he knows...
and the rest's up to you.
- So you're abandoning us?
- I never wanted to get involved.
- What's going on?
- There's someone here, I heard them.
If there was anyone here,
they've gone.
Anything missing?
The dagger with the symbol of
Kito that was hanging on the wall.
- Do you want to tell the police?
- No, what's the point?
I came by to bring you to
a meeting in my office.
It's a very important meeting.
I'd like you there as well.
Feeling better?
It's a traumatising experience...
but finding a burglar in your
home is all too common nowadays.
I don't think it was a burglar.
I'm afraid it's something else.
Something I can't figure out,
but it frightens me a lot, Peter.
I've got just the thing for you, you
have to leave New York for a while...
and shortly you'll meet our
travel companions.
Our travel companions?
Where are we going?
We're organising an expedition
to the Moluccan islands.
We've found out that the natives
call one of the islands Kito.
We'll be assisted by doctor O'Brian
who lives on one of the islands nearby.
Naturally, we'll keep him in the dark
about the nature of the expedition.
And it would be very useful
if you came as well.
As an anthropologist, I mean.
What's more, I've already got
permission from Professor Drydock.
It's not about that, I already
know the Moluccan islands.
I lived there for a
few years as a child...
and they were the best
years of my life.
I'm afraid seeing them again
today would shock me.
Yes, I understand, but you can't
spend your life living in the past.
- This is George and Susan.
- What's she doing here?
She's George's girlfriend.
Would you like a drink?
She certainly gets around.
I bet she's telling you
I'm rude and intrusive.
Perhaps.
In that case, add ambitious
to the list...
and I'd give my soul to
the devil to get a scoop.
You never know.
This might be the one.
Let's hope so.
How long has doctor O'Brien
been living on the island?
I don't know exactly.
Five or six years.
Between the heat and that
flight I just about had it.
You see what a journalist
has to put up with?
Stop it, everyone knows the best
articles on distant countries...
are all written next to the
fireplace at home.
Only when you're rich and famous.
And I have every intention
of being rich and famous as well.
I can assure you.
Word of honour.
- I hope so for your sake.
- Thanks.
We should be near O'Brian's house.
How come a famous surgeon like
him moved to this archipelago?
To treat the natives.
He's a disciple of doctor Schweitzer.
It's great to see you again.
If I'm not mistaken the last time
was at a congress in Los Angeles.
Allow me to introduce my
travelling companions.
This is Lori Ridgeway,
our anthropologist.
Susan Kelly, she'll be keeping
a diary of the expedition.
And this is my assistant,
George Happer.
If you'd like to come inside.
So we thought of you, and the
possibility of a place to stay.
- I hope we're not intruding.
- Not at all.
Something to drink?
I'm just very glad I can help you.
Life is very monotonous here,
even too much, I'd say.
I forgot to tell you.
I've hired some locals
and a guide for your expedition.
Moloto.
- This is doctor Chandler.
- It's a pleasure.
Moloto knows the archipelago very well.
We've worked together for years.
You can trust him completely.
I'm sure we'll get along very well.
Naturally we'll be in radio contact
for anything you need.
In that case I'd like to leave
in the morning at dawn.
Everything's ready.
Excuse me, but I'm very tired.
I'd like to go to bed.
Of course, I know the journey
here was very tiring.
Show the lady to her room.
We'll see you tomorrow.
It certainly won't be
a pleasant journey.
Is the island of Kito very far?
It's on the opposite side
of the archipelago.
The penultimate island
before you reach the open sea.
The inhabitants are highly primitive
and they make interesting subjects.
If I understand correctly you intend
to study their habits and customs.
- That's right.
- I don't share your enthusiasm.
They're cruel, superstitious, and
resistant to any form of civilisation.
Sometimes I'm tempted
to pack it all in...
instead of spending my
life treating them.
You sound like you need a holiday.
We'll take you with us to
New York when we return.
Who knows?
What happened?
Look, Peter, it's horrible!
It's their symbol.
It's the symbol of Kito.
Calm down.
If they really wanted to hurt you
they could easily have done so.
- Careful you don't slip.
- My bag.
It's true, I've never had
an experience like this.
I can believe it.
- Is that the island?
- I think so.
How long will it take to get to Kito?
- About an hour.
- Maybe a bit longer.
- There are problems with the engine.
- What kind?
It's overheating, we'll have
to turn it off for a while.
The problem is it's getting dark
and we can't spend the night out here.
- Can we make it to that other island?
- Yes, I think so, it's much closer.
We'll stop there tonight
and continue in the morning.
Why the rifles?
- Let's call it a precaution.
- Excessive, I'd say.
They only eat dead bodies.
So we have nothing to worry
about as long as we stay alive.
We'll have to organise
guard duties for tonight.
Take care of it.
Me and Moloto will take
the first shift.
Mikani wandered off
and he hasn't come back.
What do we do?
Shall we look for him?
No, it's too dangerous at night.
He'll come back sooner or later.
If he doesn't we'll look for
him in the morning.
Don't worry.
- What are you going to do?
- Mikani hasn't come back.
So the three of us are
going to look for him.
We'll be gone half an hour at the most.
In the meantime no-one
must leave the camp.
And I do mean no-one.
- Are you ready, George?
- Ready.
We'd better split up.
We'll go in three different directions.
Wait, I'm coming as well.
- I told you to stay at the camp.
- I'm a journalist, nobody can stop me.
What happened?
This wouldn't have happened
if he'd stayed at the camp.
We're talking about a human
being who died a horrible death.
- You're talking like I killed him.
- That isn't what I meant.
Don't you get it?
This is my job.
That's why I came,
not for a stroll in the woods.
- You're going to publish this?
- You guessed it.
What will you call it?
"Love your neighbour like yourself"?
The helpers are scared.
- Yes, I want to go home.
- Stay with us and you won't get hurt.
Now bury your friend.
Hurry up, as soon as you've
finished we'll leave this island.
- To go where'?
- To Km.
But this is Kito, isn't that right?
- You're wrong.
- No, you've got it wrong.
And if it wasn't for the
engine breaking down...
you'd have taken us
to another island.
Perhaps I got confused.
These islands all look the same.
It's hard to tell them apart.
If the information is right the village
should be at the end of this path.
It might be better to circle it
and approach from another direction.
- Did you see that as well?
- Yes, a native.
What do you think they want?
- What did they say?
- They're scared, they want to go back.
They're getting closer and
they're increasing in numbers.
They may not want to attack us.
Yes, but we'd better not
take any chances.
What is that idiot doing?
We'll have a better chance of
defending ourselves at the camp.
Come on, bury the bodies.
I'm in contact with doctor O'Brian.
Listen to me, we've been
attacked by cannibals.
We killed two of them
but we've lost two helpers.
What did you say?
Our position?
We're two miles south east
from the point where we landed.
North west.
Three miles.
Awhite building in a clearing.
Yes, I got all of that.
Tomorrow morning.
I hope we'll be able to
defend ourselves.
Yes, as soon as you can.
See you there.
He'll be here tomorrow with some men.
We have to get to an abandoned
mission three miles from here.
We'll try tomorrow.
Tonight we'll organise guard
duties amongst ourselves.
We'll all be on guard.
I'm afraid no-one will
be able to sleep tonight.
Mr. Chandler, we're over here!
We found him like this.
Mr. Chandler, help me!
- Where were you when they attacked?
- There are lots of bushes.
It's impossible to see them.
I was careful, like you.
- Dirty bastard!
- Stop.
It's pitch black, it could
have happened to any of us.
Sorry.
- Are you sure it's the right way?
- Yes, I think so.
Keep moving.
What is it?
There's something strange.
Look over there!
- And Susan?
- They've taken her.
Let's hope they don't do
the same thing to her.
Come on, let's go.
Lori.
Yes?
We made it, Peter!
Who knows who those
monstrous beings were?
I can't explain it but whatever they
were they terrified the natives.
They're the ones who saved us.
Calm down.
- You're safe here.
- Yes, but we were wiped out.
It's a miracle we're alive.
You're out of danger now.
My men are patrolling the area.
It's all over.
Go and get some food.
- What happened to Susan and George?
- It was horrible.
They ate George right in front of us!
And they took Susan away.
There was nothing we could do.
We had to defend ourselves.
- I'm afraid there's no hope for her.
- We've got to do something.
I'm sorry.
Get her away from here,
she's falling to pieces.
There's nothing more you can do here.
This island will be nothing more
than a nightmare for you.
Yes, a nightmare which you
must try to forget.
- Listen to me.
- Yes, but there's only one boat.
You'll find an inflatable raft
a couple of miles down the beach.
Take it and get back to your boat.
- But...
- I saw it on the way over here.
I'll join you tomorrow morning.
You'll go with them.
What about you?
I'll join you tomorrow
once I've gathered my men.
There's no need for you to come.
Stay with doctor O'Brian.
- You'll need his help.
- I'm an experienced sailor.
Besides, I'm sure you'll need
him more than us.
We'll see you tomorrow,
and be careful.
What is it, Peter?
- Something's wrong.
- What do you mean?
There's the inflatable raft,
just like O'Brian said.
Come on.
How did O'Brian know
where we were?
I didn't tell him we were
on a different island.
Yet he didn't hesitate to tell me
to go to the old mission.
The fact that we ran into cannibals
was enough to tell him where we were.
This island is hiding a secret.
Something far more
frightening than the cannibals.
O'Brian did everything
to keep us away from here.
First he sent us to the wrong
island, using Moloto to make sure.
Then he tried his level best
to persuade us to leave.
Do you think his secret is connected
to those monsters that saved us?
Yes, it's possible.
- What are you going to do?
- Find out what's happening on Kito.
That's insane!
It's a miracle we're alive.
Wouldn't it be better to
return with another expedition?
No, it would give O'Brian time
to clear everything up.
Don't worry,
it's going to be okay.
You'll wait for me off-shore.
I'll need you as my cover.
The slightest sign of danger you'll go,
without worrying about me.
- You can't ask me to do this.
- Let's see if the motor works.
I can't say I'm surprised.
Let's try the backup.
That's Susan!
Now we will proceed to open
the jugular vein...
to release the blood
pressure from the cranium.
The extracted blood will
be readministered at the end.
Now you can't disturb me anymore,
I've severed your vocal chords.
I'm administering a second injection
to keep the subject conscious.
- You really won't wait outside?
- Do you think I'll be safer?
Let's go.
- What is it?
- I think I saw something.
Maybe it was just a shadow.
I'm the first surgeon in the world
to attempt this operation.
I shall attempt to transplant
the brain of a young woman...
into the body of a man who has
been clinically dead for ten clays.
Don't worry, you will continue to live
like the other beings I have created.
Science will recognise you.
I did everything I could
to keep you away from Kito.
But your stubbornness
leaves me no other choice.
Okay, Chandler.
This way.
Were you looking for Susan?
Here she is.
You disappoint me.
Yours is a typical case
of average intelligence.
Sufficient enough to
figure out my secret...
but completely inadequate
to understand it.
You're a bloodthirsty lunatic.
A very superficial judgment.
The difference between
your science and mine...
is that I don't limit myself to
correcting nature's imperfections.
I improve on nature!
I'm on the verge of increasing man's
lifespan by hundreds of years.
You see these lifeless corpses?
When I want them to
they will come back to life.
I've been working on this
fantastic project for years.
Until now I've only been
able to use the natives.
I told them that anyone who
would submit to my experiments...
would become a divine being,
and I wasn't lying.
I suppose it's thanks to you
they've returned to cannibalism.
It was their ancient religious rite
which I induced them to revive.
And I must say they're very grateful.
After all, they're never
short of raw material.
Prepare the table for doctor Chandler.
I'm anxious to begin the operation.
You haven't done her any
favours helping her escape.
I'm going to give you an injection to
help you sleep and restore your energy.
I need the subject to be in
perfect physical condition.
Tomorrow morning I will transplant
your brain into one of the cadavers.
You will die to live again
in a better, younger, body.
You will tell me yourself
if the operation was a success...
and what it feels like to pass from
life to death and from death to life.
In a few minutes you will
be in deep sleep.
Sweet dreams.
- Let's prepare the corpse.
- Yes, doctor.
Hold his head still while
I make the incision.
Be careful.
Perfect.
Lift his head up.
Unfortunately, you won't
be needing these anymore.
I usually give them
to my native friends.
It's highly appreciated, they
adorn their women with them...
and it appears to increase
their sexual activity.
Go and get a bottle of blood.
Now it's your turn to have your
skin and flowing hair removed.
But science knows no obstacles
and it demands certain sacrifices.
However, I'm certain I'll resolve
any problems in the future.
Get ready for the transfusion.
You refuse to accept the
situation, doctor Chandler.
Above all, you're ungrateful.
But I'll have your brain
no matter what!
And nobody and nothing will stop me.
Put him on the operating bed!
Get him!
Come.
