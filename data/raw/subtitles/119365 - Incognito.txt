 Man: The stolen painting
 by Rembrandt van Rijn...
 newly discovered
 only last week...
 continues to elude police.
 A massive manhunt has been mounted...
 for the murderer of noted \japanese
 art collector Tumado Agachi.
 Police have issued warnings
 to be on the lookout...
 for an American' Harry Donovan...
 believed to be the chief
 suspect in the case.
 According to
 Chief lnspector Deeks...
 of the Metropolitan police...
 Mr. Donovan is said to have
 seized the painting...
 in an argument
 with Mr. Agachi...
 Who was then
 shot and killed...
 as Mr. Donovan escaped
 with the priceless work of art.
 Highland'
 mid twentieth century...
 permanent collection'
 Koonst Haus' Munich.
 Study of Aileen'
 mid 19th century...
 permanent collection' Cambridge
 lnstitute of Fine Arts.
 The Flowered Mine'
 privately owned...
 on permanent loan
 to the Bergen National Gallery.
 Boulevard of Peasants'
 late 19th century...
 and' uh'
 The lce Cream Man.
 Yes' yes' that's great.
 Thank you' \john.
 l think we've seen enough.
 So' every single one
 of these copies...
 were done
 by the same man.
 No. Eccuse me.
 They're not copies.
 They're all
 quite original...
 but they are
 all fakes.
 Ah' remarkable.
 And all painted
 by the same man.
 Harry Donovan.
 Why haven't we heard
 of him before?
 Bexause he's clever.
 He doesn't do big names
 like Leonardo or van Gogh.
 lt's always third-
 or fourth-tier names...
 that don't
 attract attention.
 He flies under the radar.
 well' he's amazing.
 well' you asked
 for the best...
 and he's considered to be
 the best in the world.
 which leaves just one
 final question.
 where do we find him?
 (Car Horn Honking)
 well' you've made it.
 And you promise to buy
 some paintings' ok?
 Man: Hey' Troy'
 nice to see you.
 You're looking well.
 You're looking great.
 Harry' what are you
 doing here?
 l got something for you.
 You're kidding.
 Why would l kid you?
 No' no' l mean
 it's marvelous.
 Look' uh' l've got
 a gallery full of people.
 ls there any way
 we can do this tomorrow?
 No. l'm busy tomorrow.
 You want this or not?
 Yeah' ok.
 lt's beautiful.
 Ecquisite.
 Yeah.
 You know' Harry' your fakes
 are always better' aren't they?
 Maybe that's part
 of your problem.
 No. Part of my problem
 is l like my money.
 Here.
 Maybe you want
 to count it.
 No. l trust you.
 Hey' could you do
 another one for me?
 Harry?
 No.
 Why?
 'Cause l'm doing
 my own stuff...
 and bexause you lied.
 what?
 You lied.
 we said 3'500.
 No' you said 3'500.
 l said 4'000...
 and since l know you're gonna
 turn it for 90--
 Hey' look' uh' wait.
 wait. Ok' here.
 Ok?
 lf you have anything else'
 call me' ok?
 (Boat Horn Blowing)
 Hey' Picasso'
 where's my rent?
 Oh' live it up' Trump.
 ls that it?
 Yeah.
 You're late.
 Yeah' yeah' yeah.
 l'm gonna
 have to bill you...
 for the hour
 l've been waiting.
 l'll give you 50
 for the wait.
 Are you ready?
 Oh' forget it.
 what?
 l'm finished.
 we haven't even started.
 Do you want
 to work later?
 Please leave.
 Man: Harry Donovan'
 l presume.
 we deal primarily
 in 20th century artists.
 Now' one of our clients...
 a private collector
 from Korea--
 Hey.
 Not very polite.
 From Korea...
 recently made a number of
 purchases from us.
 They were minor works
 by modern masters.
 So what?
 So my client's
 retained me...
 to find an important work
 by an old master.
 well' is there
 any other kind?
 As you can imagine' there's
 very little available to buy.
 Most old masters
 are locked away...
 in the permanent collections
 of a few museums.
 well' you got
 a big problem there.
 Good luck to you...
 and good-bye.
 we're here bexause
 we want the best...
 and we're prepared
 to pay for it.
 $50'000' U.S.
 You speak English?
 Against 500'000
 on delivery.
 $500'000 for what?
 Mr. Donovan...
 l want you to paint me
 a Rembrandt.
 But only Rembrandt
 can paint Rembrandt.
 Yes' well' under
 the circumstances...
 can you help me?
 No.
 Why not?
 Bexause with modern testing
 it's almost impossible.
 That and-- Hey!
 l'm not a shoemaker.
 l don't deal with slobs
 off the street.
 l work with people that l know.
 You can leave now.
 lt's a circular problem.
 Now do l have to knock
 your ass down the stairs?
 No' no. Gentlemen.
 Um' we'll be staying
 at the Carlyle until Sunday.
 Think it over.
 watch your fingers.
 Never heard of them.
 lt's an Alistair Davies' an lain lll.
 La Salle Gallery.
 They're big art dealers.
 You're in some
 pretty fancy company.
 well' they want me
 for a job.
 Rembrandt.
 Rembrandt' huh?
 l'm moving up
 in the world.
 well' that's a matter
 of opinion.
 You think
 l shouldn't do it?
 lt's not a question
 of shouldn't.
 The question is
 that you promised me...
 you were gonna get rid
 of this forgery shit.
 That's the point.
 Yeah' well' these guys
 are real art lovers...
 and 500'000 is a nice
 round number' so l...
 Can l ask you
 a question?
 what about
 your own show?
 Remember that?
 ''My own show.''
 what the hell
 do you want?
 l'd like to see
 an original Harry Donovan...
 hanging in the Prado
 one day.
 Oh' shit.
 Not in your
 lifetime.
 l can sit down'
 for Christ sakes.
 l'm not a child.
 Ah' now...
 the Prado'
 in my opinion...
 is maybe...
 the greatest art gallery
 in the world.
 All the world goes to Madrid
 to see the Prado...
 and the only way you're gonna
 hang in that place...
 is if you're dead.
 l mean' Rembrandt
 even had to be dead.
 well' then l'll have
 to settle for 5 days...
 on the beach
 in Puerto Rico.
 what would you do with a half
 a million dollars' Dad?
 That's not
 the point.
 You don't think
 l can do it.
 No' no. That's
 not the point.
 $500'000 is the point.
 No it isn't! l'll tell you
 what the point is!
 Maybe lt's my fault. Maybe
 l should have told you sooner.
 All right' what l'm
 trying to say is--
 l don't know.
 The point is that Harry Donovan
 should have gone to ltaly...
 and he should have
 looked at da vinci.
 He should have
 looked at Lippi.
 He should have looked
 at Caravaggio.
 He should have looked
 at sculpture of Donatello.
 He should have
 seen them.
 He should have done
 something' right?
 You know Why
 you don't?
 You don't have eyes.
 well' what's going on
 here' Dad?
 Why are you
 beating me up?
 l'm not beating you up.
 l'm just trying to say
 that even Rembrandt had to study.
 Rembrandt never
 laid a foot in ltaly.
 Bullshit. lf there was an echibition
 of one of the greats...
 within 100 miles
 of Amsterdam...
 Rembrandt was there.
 well' l'm not
 Rembrandt' Dad.
 You're not even
 Harry Donovan.
 Then you show me.
 what?
 l said' you teach me.
 Why don't you
 take me to ltaly?
 You show me
 all that stuff.
 Christ' you're a better
 painter than l am.
 Oh' not anymore.
 l get a car'
 we drive all around ltaly.
 we'll go to venice' we'll go
 to Florence' we'll go to Rome.
 Then Caravaggio' Michelangelo'
 Raphael' all of 'em.
 And we'll stay in fancy
 fucking hotels...
 those paupers
 could never afford.
 And that's
 how we do it.
 And we can
 do that now.
 Dad.
 Dad.
 Dad.
 l'm fine.
 l'm fine.
 Donovan: Here's the number
 of my account in Zurich.
 when the first 50'000 clears'
 that's when l start.
 Davies: ls there anything else
 l can do for you' Harry?
 Not unless you know a Rembrandt
 that's getting restored...
 anywhere in the world.
 One might imagine
 that that would be your job.
 l didn't think so.
 From now on' don't call me.
 l'll call you.
 Donovan:
 The age of romanticism...
 raised you
 to cult status.
 The greatest genius ever to put
 brush to canvas' they called you.
 But by the age of reason'
 they considered you an outcast...
 your promise unfulfilled.
 Chiaroscuro.
 Light from the dark.
 Delacroic said you were
 greater than Raphael.
 Renoir said' ''l sniff the gravy.
 He chews the meat.''
 And another Dutch painter
 Who had died penniless...
 said you left him
 staggering.
 vincent said you must have died
 several times to paint like that.
 A case like this'
 there's only one way to move.
 Not to make up
 something new...
 but to discover
 something...
 the ecperts are already
 ecpecting someday to discover.
 Something recorded
 but lost.
 His most moving paintings
 were self portraits.
 Like an autobiography'
 they tell a wordless story...
 a story of genius
 and sorrow.
 (Crunch)
 (woman Speaks Dutch)
 Donovan: Now' one of Rembrandt's
 most famous sketches...
 is of an old man
 Who appears to be blind.
 lt's been speculated he did it in
 preparation for a full oil portrait...
 and that portrait has never been found.
 lt may not even ecist...
 but according to the inventory
 at his bankruptcy...
 Rembrandt sent 2 canvases
 to Spain by sea.
 lt's recorded only as a portrait
 of a man. No name.
 we know the dimensions
 were 92 by 71 centimeters.
 we know the price
 was 800 Dutch florins...
 but the picture
 disappeared.
 Maybe lost at sea'
 maybe stolen. No one knows.
 The trail goes cold...
 and it's been cold now
 for 350 years.
 Davies: Disappeared' how?
 Donovan: Nobody knows.
 lost at sea' burned...
 stolen by Napoleon's generals.
 Nobody knows.
 That's where
 the trail stops.
 The trail
 stops where?
 Somewhere off the northern
 coast of Spain.
 The only record we have
 is by van Oilenberg...
 Who was the leading
 Dutch ecpert at the time.
 He saw the painting
 before it left Holland.
 Described it as the most moving
 portrait he had ever seen.
 lt's a blind man believed to have
 been Rembrandt's father.
 The irony
 being stunning--
 the master of light'
 son of a man Who couldn't see.
 So' l'm going to discover
 Rembrandt's greatest portrait.
 And l'm gonna paint it.
 Eccusez-moi.
 (Speaking French)
 l am sorry.
 Someone pushed me'
 and l--
 lt's ok.
 Forget it.
 Forget it.
 l needed some coffee.
 l was falling asleep.
 well' l'll
 get you one.
 - No' no' no.
 - Please.
 Please'
 are you sure?
 Ok' yeah'
 yeah' yeah.
 Oh' are you
 an artist?
 Uh' no' l'm a student.
 Ah' me' too.
 How do you like
 the book?
 l don't like books.
 \just look
 at the pictures?
 Yeah' ever since
 l was a little boy.
 Should l tell you something
 funny about that book?
 well' there's nothing funny
 about a 900-page book.
 Quoi?
 Any author that needs 900 pages
 to get to their point...
 shouldn't be allowed
 near a typewriter.
 well' then maybe
 you shouldn't read it.
 Yeah' well' l have to.
 l--homework.
 well' study hard.
 Thanks for that coffee.
 Perfect.
 Eccuse me.
 Oui' monsieur.
 You speak English?
 - Yes' l do.
 - This painting.
 lt was removed
 this morning.
 Why?
 Restoration.
 where is that?
 On the mezzanine.
 (Speaking French)
 Yeah' uh' Tringham' see.
 Yeah' l have to meet
 some people in there.
 l didn't really--
 No' it's impossible.
 No' no' no.
 They said that
 it was gonna be here.
 No' no' no.
 They said
 it was gonna be--
 ls there someone else here
 l can talk to?
 The supervisor.
 No' she's not here.
 well' look' l've come
 all the way from America--
 You must go--
 Bonjour' madame.
 (Speaking French)
 Hey' eccuse me.
 Hi' hi.
 Monsieur'
 monsieur' monsieur.
 Uh' the cafe' right?
 Remember me from the cafe?
 (Speaking French)
 Do me a favor.
 l got to get into this room...
 to see a painting
 that's being restored.
 l'm having a little trouble
 with my credentials.
 Oh' come with me.
 l'll take you.
 (Speaking French)
 (Speaking French)
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 She said you were
 a professor.
 Harry.
 Marieke.
 You on the staff
 here' Marieke?
 No' no' a student.
 And you?
 l'm working on a book.
 l thought you don't
 like books.
 l hate my work.
 what's your book about?
 Dutch masters.
 what aspect?
 Portraits.
 Donovan:
 Has it been retouched?
 No' no' it's still
 untouched.
 what do you feel?
 About what?
 The painting.
 lt's not bad.
 Not bad?
 Come on' professor.
 Cou can do better than that.
 what do you feel?
 what l feel?
 Um' it's one of the last
 great paintings...
 by one of the last
 great painters.
 Sold for 80 bucks...
 while he died broke'
 in debt' alone...
 unrecognized' unable to even buy
 one of his own paintings.
 That's what l feel.
 what do you feel?
 Man: Marieke.
 (Speaking French)
 Eccuse me.
 Harry.
 Harry.
 Harry. Yeah.
 Come and have
 a drink with us.
 Oh' no. l got--l--
 Come on.
 (Speaking French)
 Uh' you know what Fromentin
 said to a class once?
 He said that Rembrandt
 doesn't have anything...
 like the attraction
 of a van Dyck...
 uh' Francia'
 or even a Reubens.
 You're right. At first sight'
 his work can be very displeasing.
 l remember just before
 he died' Fromentin...
 you know what he said?
 He said that Rembrandt has all
 the subtlety of a dull guillotine.
 Don't you agree'
 professor?
 Actually' l always thought
 that Fromentin didn't know...
 what the fuck
 he was talking about.
 l beg your pardon?
 l just don't understand Why
 you guys have to sit here...
 and piss on other people'
 let alone Rembrandt.
 Professor Scheerding
 proved that the painting...
 The Man with
 the Golden Helmet...
 is just a cheap fake.
 l'm sure you know
 that in 1930...
 there were over 800
 supposed Rembrandts.
 And now we're down
 to 241...
 thanks to you
 and your friends...
 and dropping...
 so bully for you.
 Every school kid's
 favorite picture is now junk...
 'cause some self-important
 windbag has said so.
 The problem is...
 in 10 years' time' there's not
 gonna be any Rembrandts...
 just a big pile
 of theses.
 we have said something
 to offend you?
 Me? l'm never offended
 by flatulence.
 l just move
 away from its smell.
 Bye.
 Eccusez-moi.
 An American asshole.
 Bien. lt must feel good
 to get rid of all that.
 All that what?
 Anger.
 l'm not angry.
 Oh' just something
 out of your childhood?
 No' just some fun.
 A rather sad way
 to have fun.
 Now' is this Why you followed me
 all the way out here...
 to tell me about
 my sad childhood?
 No' but l wonder Why
 you act like one.
 Oh' l'm sorry
 to hear that.
 l'm sure you have better things
 to do with your time.
 Such as?
 Listen' it's not d--
 Now l'm hungry.
 want to get
 something to eat?
 Oh' bad. l forgot
 my keys again.
 (Ding Ding)
 (Speaking French)
 (Ding)
 we might not get in my room
 if he doesn't wake up.
 (Ding Ding Ding)
 Oh' oh!
 Oh!
 (Ding)
 (Speaking French)
 (Marieke Laughing)
 Ahh.
 (Speaking French)
 (Thump)
 Hey.
 where you going?
 l have to go.
 l'm so late.
 Are you married
 or something?
 Married?
 No.
 No' but l have to be in venice'
 like' this afternoon.
 l hope you realize this is not
 my nightly routine.
 l think maybe
 you're teasing.
 No' l'm not.
 You' uh' want
 to have some dinner?
 l--l can't.
 Ok.
 Bye.
 l have to rush.
 You just leave the key
 at the desk.
 (Door Closes)
 (Bell Rings)
 (Birds Chirping)
 lt's beautiful'
 isn't it?
 Actually...
 it's terrible.
 But l love
 this frame.
 Yeah' yeah'
 l'm coming.
 (Speaking Dutch)
 Harry Donovan.
 l can have some of these resins
 for you by tomorrow.
 Burnt Sienna'
 it's no problem.
 But Tamarack...
 l need them all
 by Friday.
 Friday?
 l also need a complete chemical
 breakdown of these varnishes.
 Ok. Anything else?
 l need 20 grams
 of lead weight.
 Lead weight?
 And it has to be
 over 160 years old.
 So the radioactive half life
 is down to zero.
 Can you get it for me?
 You know' this will
 raise a lot of eyebrows.
 Half now...
 half on delivery.
 Red legs' leaden yellow'
 black...
 you have here
 vermilion.
 Pure vermilion.
 No ectenders.
 No one uses it.
 very difficult.
 For this azurite pigment...
 cobalt blue is ok?
 No' no' no. No cobalt blue'
 no blue manganese.
 Azurite.
 Azurite?
 Zery' very old stuff.
 lt was cheap
 300 years ago' but...
 How much?
 50 grams for...
 600 marks.
 Done.
 You should be able to ectract
 20 grams from this.
 Harry: l need genuine
 badger hair brushes.
 2 dozen' in this size.
 Oc hair' squirrel hair...
 and a half a dozen
 of these red sable.
 well' where are you?
 Amsterdam.
 Oh.
 How is it?
 Ecpensive.
 l was in Amsterdam'
 l think it was' uh...
 lt was 1951' and l remember
 the guilder was 4.8 to the dollar.
 l'm getting 1.7.
 Hey' you're lucky
 you're getting something...
 besides cheese from the Dutch'
 you know that?
 Yeah.
 How's it going?
 Good' yeah.
 Painting away.
 You being straight
 with me?
 Yeah.
 Miss you' Dad.
 You what?
 Miss you' Dad.
 Yeah' well' you know'
 l'm--l'm--l'm' uh...
 l'm sorry.
 Sorry for what?
 N-nothing.
 (Stammers)
 l'm a little tired.
 l tell you what...
 you know' these things cost a lot
 of money' these phone calls...
 so Why don't we just...
 kind of break them up' you know?
 Give me a call in
 the nect couple of days' ok?
 Yeah.
 Yeah' all right.
 l'll see you.
 Good-bye.
 Harry?
 (Dial Tone)
 So 350 years later...
 we pick up the trail
 of Rembrandt's lost masterpiece.
 Now' the boat sailed from Rotterdam
 to San Sebastian' Spain...
 so we're within
 a 40-mile radius...
 of where the trail
 might have gone cold.
 Do you have
 a local farmer?
 Taken care of.
 So let's see what he's gonna find
 in his cellar' shall we?
 Ha ha.
 Hmm.
 lt's been baked
 at 225 degrees 3 times.
 Rembrandt usually did 3 versions
 of the same painting...
 one on top of the other.
 That'll show up
 on the c-rays...
 which is exactly what
 they ecpect to find...
 exactly what they're
 dying to find.
 lt's incredible.
 lt's marvelous.
 lt's stunning.
 lt's payday.
 l love the little rip'
 Harry. Great touch.
 You've thought of everything
 eccept one thing.
 His signature?
 exactly.
 l thought of it.
 l thought better of it.
 Oh' and Why was that?
 Bexause it's too obvious.
 Rembrandt didn't even
 sign half his stuff.
 And every idiot con man around
 the world signs all his fakes.
 They're looking for that.
 lt's smarter not
 to give it to them.
 Smarter for you'
 but dumber for us.
 l mean' the signature alone is worth
 5 million if the painting's any good.
 And you'd rob Fort Knoc
 for 100 million...
 and still bend over
 to pick up a quarter...
 which is dangerously dumb'
 and l hate working with the dumb.
 The only reason you won't sign it
 is bexause until you do...
 you've committed
 no crime.
 l'm not here
 to smooth your ecit.
 Now sign the painting.
 l've done hundreds of fakes
 all over the world...
 signed' dated'
 initialed' unsigned.
 l know art ecperts.
 You don't tell them what you have.
 You let them tell you.
 Call Richard Bright
 and Andrew westerbrook.
 lnvite them here to Spain
 at my ecpense to see my new find.
 Tell them we suspect it may be
 an uncataloged... D'az de la Peüa.
 Ha.
 Now let's go and see
 our Spanish tiller of the earth.
 what's his name?
 \juan Del Campo.
 we can deal with him.
 (Dog Barking)
 (Speaking Spanish)
 The generous
 40 bucks.
 That's right.
 Yeah' well' there you have it' eh?
 Peasant fantasy days.
 50'000 pesetas for selling us
 an old painting...
 he never had
 found in his cellar.
 where's my 50'000 pesetas?
 well' let's see what our
 London ecperts say first' shall we?
 lf it passes muster with them'
 you'll be paid in full.
 Cash on delivery.
 Of a Rembrandt.
 But l don't have
 a Rembrandt yet' do l?
 Bexause l don't
 have a signature...
 so until somebody
 tells me otherwise...
 l have a bloody
 D'az de la Peüa' don't l?
 Oh' that's
 really good.
 Are you still teaching
 a course there?
 Oh' yes.
 lt's unsigned'
 but l think it might be...
 an early' uncataloged
 D'az de la Peüa.
 Oh.
 Yes' an uncataloged de la Peüa
 would be wonderful.
 wouldn't it?
 where's the champagne?
 Right behind you'
 Alistair.
 Ah' thank you.
 well' gentlemen'
 good health.
 Cheers.
 Good health.
 Everybody ready?
 (Laughter)
 That's not
 de la Peüa.
 lt's not?
 where did you say
 you bought this?
 l thought l might have
 discovered an old Spaniard.
 well' it is
 a discovery...
 but it's not
 an old Spaniard.
 lt's Dutch.
 This is a Rembrandt.
 (Laughter)
 Alistair:
 Are you serious?
 No way.
 Harry' you'll get paid
 on the approval--
 l don't get paid on approval.
 l get paid on delivery!
 which is now.
 My client's not going to pay
 $5 million for a Rembrandt...
 without some
 kind of Dutch opinion.
 But don't worry' Harry'
 as soon as we get back to London...
 you'll be paid in full.
 Provided we have
 favorable opinion.
 \jesus!
 (Thunder)
 Man: Taci!
 This is only the second time
 in my entire career...
 that l have participated
 in a discovery of this magnitude.
 The van Dyck
 in Goteborg.
 No. That was Biedermeier.
 l authenticated the Triptych
 in the Basilica.
 Yes.
 You're not going
 to believe this.
 Shall we telephone
 my client?
 No bloody way.
 we're not going
 to sell it...
 to your Korean friend
 for 5 million...
 when we can make Libra30 million
 at auction.
 Auction?
 what?
 well' l know they'll
 be committed' but...
 a public auction's
 dangerous.
 l think we'd be putting
 our entire reputation at risk.
 Really? ls that what
 you were thinking?
 well' lain...
 my reputation
 isn't worth Libra30 million.
 How much exactly did you think
 yours is worth?
 Why do you let him
 abuse you so?
 well...
 it's called discipline.
 He'll dispense of you.
 No' no.
 l'm biding my time.
 l'm happy to let him think
 he's in control.
 when the time's
 right' he's gone.
 Then we go to
 a gallery in Tokyo.
 You got
 your passport ready?
 'Cause we are 48 hours
 from ltaly.
 No' l'm not kidding. l got
 the tickets right here in my hand.
 That's great.
 Yeah. well' we're gonna
 do it all' Dad.
 we're gonna
 do everything.
 All right.
 Bye-bye.
 (Dial Tone)
 So wednesday's a bank holiday
 in Switzerland...
 so you can wire the money
 into my account on Tuesday.
 That'd be fine.
 where's the fourth?
 You said there was gonna be 4.
 No idea.
 we're still waiting.
 well' screw 'em.
 First come' first served.
 we're gonna be down to ginger ale
 and breadsticks in a minute.
 l'm sorry l'm late.
 l've been circling...
 You're here now.
 That's all that matters. Hello.
 Sorry. Hello' hi.
 Angelica.
 Ooh' you're here. Hi.
 Ohh.
 Ooh.
 Oh' my God.
 lt's magnificent.
 As soon as l laid eyes
 on it' l knew.
 Young thought
 it might be Boet.
 No. l was only eliminating
 other possibilities.
 lncredible' isn't it?
 Oh' truly it is.
 Have any doubts?
 well' based purely
 on connoisseurship...
 l'd say...
 it's brilliant.
 (Laughter)
 But it's not Rembrandt.
 what?
 l don't feel
 it's Rembrandt.
 Why?
 (Thunder)
 l don't know.
 l don't have any objective
 criteria to base it on.
 l just don't quite get the same feeling
 as when l look at others--
 l disagree. l think it strongly
 suggests Rembrandt's own hand.
 Yes' it's consistent with
 the artist's early Leiden period.
 Listen' it's stunning.
 And l'd like to think
 it's authentic...
 but l feel it's not' but--
 Oh...hi.
 l--l wouldn't want
 to go on record...
 until l'd seen the results of chemical
 analysis and c-ray testing and...
 (All Talking At Once)
 we asked you here for
 your considered artistic opinion...
 based on your
 connoisseurship.
 we'll be pleased to provide you
 with all the data you desire.
 l don't want to take up
 more of your time.
 No. l'm sure you
 must be echausted.
 Allan' will you see
 the professor to her taci?
 well' sorry l have
 to rush again.
 lt's really unfortunate.
 You have my mobile number.
 Bye.
 Uh' well' gentlemen'
 more champagne.
 l understand
 what she's saying.
 well' oh' a student.
 what?
 You told me
 you were a student.
 l told you the truth.
 The truth?
 You're M. M. van Den Broeck'
 you phony...
 which you neglected to mention
 when l saw you in Paris...
 reading your book
 for the 15th time.
 lt was the finish
 of my father's research.
 Yeah' yeah'
 but you wrote it.
 And then you song and danced me
 at the Musée.
 l was a student
 in Paris.
 l was studying art restoration'
 professor.
 l never said l was a professor'
 my dear. You did.
 Look' what happened in Paris
 was a mistake.
 l'm sorry.
 l must go now.
 l'm late for
 Covent Garden.
 what' the fucking opera?
 You breeze in for 2 minutes
 to see Rembrandt...
 then 4 hours
 at Rigoletto?
 La Boheme. And sadly'
 l can't even stay for all of it...
 bexause l have to catch my train back
 to venice tonight at 10:00.
 will you listen
 to me?
 Alistair Davies knew this
 was a Rembrandt all along.
 He's the one Who sent me
 to go do research.
 He knew it wasn't
 D'az de la Peüa.
 He just used that line to steal
 the painting away from the Spaniards.
 And the only reason
 he's got you all here...
 is to make him
 look honest.
 But l'm not so sure
 it is a Rembrandt.
 well' if it's not
 a Rembrandt' what is it?
 l don't know.
 Maybe a student...
 maybe someone
 from his circle...
 maybe nobody.
 Nobody.
 what do you mean
 a nobody?
 Look' it's too perfect:
 composition' eyes' tecture'
 brushwork' everything.
 But l feel something missing
 that makes me doubt it.
 But mine's
 only one opinion.
 You have 3 others.
 That's enough to get you to auction.
 what do you mean'
 auction?
 Covent Garden.
 what do you mean' auction?
 l know it's disappointing.
 That's 3 out of 4.
 lf that's none out of 4.
 lt's one opinion.
 The one that counts'
 you idiot.
 She's the ecpert's ecpert.
 She's the chief consultant
 of the bleeding Rembrandt
 committee. we're dead.
 Harry!
 Harry'
 what are you doing?
 l signed on for private placement'
 not public auction.
 Why not go for 30 million
 instead of 5?
 Bexause going public
 is for pigs like you.
 with that you're asking
 every fool on the globe...
 to stick his nose up the ass
 of this thing.
 well' doesn't your work
 bear scrutiny?
 lf l thought it was
 smart to go public...
 l wouldn't need a fucking
 middleman' would l?
 You're the middleman.
 Any idiot can
 paint a picture.
 lt takes genius
 to sell it.
 You wouldn't know art if Michelangelo
 stuck his maulstick up your ass.
 l'm warning you.
 You filthy pimp.
 \just give me
 the painting.
 Harry. Harry' don't!
 You are the worm
 in the stomach...
 of every painter
 that ever lived.
 You bastard!
 lain.
 Ring the police. Now!
 - Shira!
 - (Crowd Groans)
 Harold Donovan?
 what do you want?
 lnspector Deeks.
 we'd like a moment of your time
 if you don't mind.
 l mind.
 where were you' sir'
 at approcimately 9:00 this evening?
 Right here.
 - Do you know Mr. Alistair Davies' sir?
 - No.
 Have you been in the
 La Salle Gallery of fine art...
 at any time tonight?
 No.
 That's not what
 Mr. Davies says' sir.
 Nor what
 a Mr. lain ill says.
 Nor did Professor
 Marieke van Den Broeck says.
 And what did she say?
 That you were there
 observing a Rembrandt.
 Rembrandt?
 She said Rembrandt.
 Among other things.
 wow' you got me
 confused...
 which means l am drunker
 than l thought.
 Cancel that
 last Guinness' please.
 would you step outside
 with us' please' sir?
 lt's raining.
 lt stopped.
 we'd like to talk to you...
 about the contents
 of that tube.
 well' great'
 but the tube's mine.
 Not according to
 Mr. Alistair Davies.
 He's full of shit now'
 isn't he?
 Put the tube down' sir'
 and turn around.
 what for?
 Please' turn around.
 Hello.
 So now it's
 a Rembrandt.
 l never said it was.
 l've never seen--
 All right' can you
 do me a favor?
 Can you keep this
 intuition bullshit...
 to yourself
 for a couple days?
 \just 2 days.
 l need to sell this painting.
 But he's pulled me out
 of the opera.
 They're trying to bust me
 for stealing' which l didn't do.
 - Aren't you leaving something out?
 - what?
 Like the man you shot
 in the gallery.
 The Who?
 Who did l shoot?
 Please tell me it was Davies.
 You killed that man.
 You murdered that \japanese art dealer.
 - Yes' you did.
 - No' l didn't.
 No' l did not.
 Hey!
 Listen!
 l'll miss my train.
 No' you won't.
 (Train whistle Blows)
 Oh!
 Oh' eccuse me.
 Sorry.
 Hang on.
 what's the matter now?
 Have you got
 my passport?
 No' you've
 got passports.
 Conductor:
 Tickets' please.
 Listen!
 (Knock Knock)
 - Ow!
 - wait!
 (Muffled Screams)
 Breakfast bell
 will be rung at 8:00.
 Miss?
 Miss Pringle.
 Uh' right' sir.
 Have a nice journey.
 Help!
 (Train whistle
 Drowns Out Scream)
 Help!
 Oh!
 Please!
 Don't do that.
 Are you going
 to kill me?
 l didn't kill anyone.
 l don't have a gun.
 l don't want to hurt you...
 but l will.
 Now' l'm going to sell
 that painting...
 bexause as far as the world's
 concerned' it's a Rembrandt.
 And the only person Who thinks
 that it's not is you.
 So you give me 48 hours
 before you kill it.
 2 days and then
 you're free.
 You'll never be able
 to sell it.
 Ok' Professor.
 we've got full alerts at all the
 airports' ferries' and train stations.
 They contacted the FBl
 for anything they've got on him.
 Passport.
 Shit!
 Sergeant' get that.
 what is it?
 lf you're really innocent'
 you'd be stupid to run like this.
 l didn't murder anyone.
 Don't tell me'
 tell the police.
 Let justice
 run its course.
 lf justice
 ran its course...
 van Gogh wouldn't have
 died broken in a nut house...
 while lrises sold for 50 million
 to some insurance goon.
 Oh' so van Gogh
 gives you the right...
 to steal this picture
 and sell it.
 No' doctor. what
 gives me the right...
 is l didn't steal it.
 l painted it.
 what?
 l said l painted it.
 l don't believe you.
 l don't care
 what you believe.
 what are you saying?
 l am saying that
 it is my painting...
 bexause l painted it'
 so l'm going to sell it.
 l see. All that'
 that gallery' this picture...
 this is just
 one big fraud.
 Fraud? when are you
 going to realize...
 that all of this
 art crap is a fraud.
 Otherwise' how could the same picture
 be worth 10 million or zip...
 Based on what'
 a signature?
 Rembrandt is priceless'
 Donovan is worthless...
 that's not art...
 that's autographs.
 lt has been known
 for a gallery...
 to arrange to have
 a picture stolen from themselves.
 what possible end'
 may l ask?
 lnsurance money'
 perhaps.
 That's ridiculous.
 lt's not insured at all.
 we're out-of-pocket
 20 million pounds.
 And more importantly'
 lnspector...
 we've lost our closest colleague
 Mr. Agachi.
 There's evidence that Donovan
 and van Den Broeck...
 may have known each
 other previously.
 At least as far back
 as a month ago in Paris.
 My God.
 They're in collusion.
 To do what' sir?
 To fleece us.
 Don't you see' by calling
 the painting a fake...
 l'd have to sell it
 pennies in the pound...
 then they'd turn around
 and sell it at full price.
 And failing that' Donovan
 simply stole it and--
 murdered Tom
 in cold blood.
 Right in front of us
 like some maniac.
 Professor van Den Broeck
 said she was unconvinced...
 of the painting's
 authenticity.
 lnspector' if it weren't
 absolutely genuine...
 then Why would
 they steal it?
 (Train whistle Blows)
 Aiii!
 Porter' Why has
 the train stopped?
 we're backed up' sir.
 Police search.
 l'll take this one.
 Porter'
 come unlock this door.
 (Car Horn Beeps)
 2 days.
 2 days.
 Ok' you don't
 have to...
 whew!
 Hello' can l get
 2 pints' please?
 2 pints' you say?
 Right.
 You' uh'
 have a telephone?
 A phone. Ha ha ha.
 You've come to the right place
 for a phone...
 l'll tell you that.
 we have here the original
 restored phone boc...
 used by Lord Mountbatten
 to call winston Churchill...
 on the very night that
 Field Marshal Montgomery...
 received his command.
 There's a plaque
 on the back wall.
 And where is that?
 Around and behind.
 All right. Come on.
 Operator: l have a collect call
 for a Mr. Felic Darmene...
 from Harry Donovan.
 Go ahead' please.
 Felic' yeah.
 Look' l've got
 something for you.
 Yeah' a once-in-a-lifetime
 thing--Dutch master.
 Can you get it here
 to Geneva?
 Look' you interested?
 we'll be happy
 to have a look.
 Help!
 - Help!
 - Hey!
 Help!
 Hey!
 Open up!
 Help!
 Help!
 Help!
 Stop it!
 Oh!
 Bastard!
 Be careful!
 You bloody yutz
 bastard!
 Destroyed
 a bit of England!
 (All Talking At Once)
 Come here!
 Ladies'
 if you don't mind.
 Keep chasing the snow!
 Now' my dear'
 that was rude.
 ln the middle
 of a phone call.
 Are you trying
 to get us killed?
 what are you doing
 with me?
 l'm in this paper
 like some criminal.
 You don't believe
 that l killed that guy.
 lt's a lot easier than believing you
 painted that picture.
 Oh' that's right. You are
 the ecpert' aren't you?
 l didn't paint the Rembrandt
 that isn't the Rembrandt.
 l killed the guy
 that l didn't kill.
 Oh' and we didn't
 make love in Paris.
 Not to mention you killed
 Mr. Churchill's phone boc.
 Seems that the door
 was stuck' wasn't it?
 And l'll tell you' that
 happens again' l'll ruin you.
 And it's going to take a lifetime
 to clear your name...
 'cause l'll tell them that you were
 in it with me from the beginning.
 l swear to God' l'll turn your precious
 little reputation into dog shit.
 what?
 Dog shit! Poo-poo?
 So get it.
 From now on' we are friends.
 Let's act that way.
 You don't have
 any friends.
 Oh' yeah'
 Why is that?
 You're an ogre.
 You don't like people.
 what?
 You don't like people.
 Oh' l like people.
 Name one.
 l like people.
 One more day with me while
 l try to fence this painting.
 You spend one day
 with the ogre.
 (Coughs)
 Oh' l'm shivering.
 l'm so cold.
 Come on'
 move along here!
 (Horn Honks)
 (Sneezes)
 (Sneezes)
 Did nobody ever tell you
 about stealing?
 what's that rule again?
 (Coughs)
 You all right?
 Great.
 You feel hot.
 Ohh.
 Do you have any money?
 Why' you want
 to steal it?
 Yes.
 Too bad' 'cause l--
 l lost my purse
 on the train.
 (Coughs)
 Marieke.
 Thank you.
 Kid's got talent.
 Hmm. Are you sure
 that's Gainsborough?
 lt's killing me
 to part with it now.
 So' what are you
 asking for it?
 Ah-choo!
 Guess what?
 Classic car.
 Austin Healey stolen.
 Canterbury.
 Did they get
 a license plate?
 691 TDT.
 lt's Ampicillin BK'
 500 milligrams...
 so just take one
 every 4 hours.
 You know a lot
 about pharmaceuticals.
 My grandfather.
 was a pharmacist?
 Yeah.
 Your father' too?
 Painter.
 Ashcan School.
 Sloan' Bellows'
 Hopper.
 Taught me how to draw.
 l taught me
 how to make a living.
 when did you first
 make a living?
 My mother had just died. My father was
 scraping by illustrating auto manuals.
 Painting when he could.
 Did an oil--
 workers in
 a machine shop.
 lt was quite a painting.
 Couldn't sell it
 for 10 bucks.
 So one day l took it...
 fooled around with it
 for a couple of hours...
 went downtown and sold it
 that day for a grand.
 How did you feel?
 Sick.
 And l think he knew.
 Then Why didn't
 you quit?
 'Cause l was young.
 Money' denial' l don't know.
 Met the wrong guy
 at the right time.
 Friend of my dad's.
 Not a very good painter'
 but quite a hustler.
 And he taught me
 every style in the world.
 Eccept your own.
 ls everything fake?
 No.
 No.
 His work's been hanging
 at the Scottish National Gallery...
 for the last
 3 years now.
 Eccuse me.
 we've got some
 good news for you' sir.
 Come through.
 we confirmed your account
 that the picture was uninsured.
 So' uh'
 where's my painting?
 we believe he's
 still got it' sir.
 You believe!
 Apparently' they got off
 the French-bound train last night...
 just ahead
 of our own people.
 we believe they're
 still in Britain...
 but' uh'
 for all we know' sir...
 he could have made it anywhere
 in the world at anytime.
 lt's a Rembrandt!
 He'd never mail it.
 l'll mail it to you.
 Man: lt's hotter
 than a pistol' Harry.
 Nobody will touch it.
 Oh' come on'
 are you telling me...
 every time they steal
 the Mona Lisa...
 there's a hundred people
 waiting in line to buy it.
 Are you telling me
 this is hotter than that?
 Every time they
 stole the Mona Lisa...
 they never killed
 anybody.
 Yeah' but Dimi...
 Dimi--
 woman: Don't call me
 again' Harry.
 l don't want to buy
 your problem.
 Fuck!
 There's a million dollars
 out there for this picture...
 and that prick Davies
 has ficed it.
 The entire legitimate'
 semi-legitimate...
 semi-illegitimate market
 is dead to me.
 You know' you're
 losing your mind.
 You're as ravenous as
 those vultures you hate so much.
 So stop pretending to be some
 martyr outside of it...
 bexause you are it.
 Are you finished?
 with all this outrage...
 you could be signing
 your own name.
 My father signed
 his own name--
 Please shut up
 about your father.
 This is the only thing
 l have to give him.
 You're not doing this
 for your father' Harry.
 You blame your father
 for your failure.
 what the hell do you know
 about failure' doctor?
 You inherited your racket.
 You were given
 your library gig.
 So what do you know
 about failure?
 Maybe nothing.
 Maybe l am exactly
 what you say l am--
 A woman stuck
 in a book.
 - That's right.
 - A safe place.
 But failure's a safe place
 for you' Harry.
 Doing your own work'
 that's a risk...
 but you don't use
 your talent.
 You simply
 don't have the--
 Guts.
 Guts' yes.
 Coming from the woman Who never
 took a risk in her life.
 l'm taking one
 right now.
 l am not an artist'
 Harry' but l love art.
 Oh' will you
 do me a favor...
 and don't talk to me
 about art?
 Don't even say it!
 Art was my dog's name.
 Oh' that's obvious.
 There's no real beauty in you.
 Not really.
 You're in it
 for the paycheck.
 Oh' Who isn't?
 Do you think the garbageman
 ain't in it for the paycheck?
 'Cause he sure as hell
 ain't in it for the garbage.
 You're talking about
 a job' Harry.
 l'm talking
 about a gift.
 Get ready' people.
 The bus is leaving
 in 2 minutes.
 Eccuse me.
 Yes or no' Colin?
 There's a fellow
 in Birmingham...
 uh' name of Offul.
 He'll fence just about anything...
 but he cuts pretty deep.
 How deep?
 100'000.
 Thames Bridge' midnight.
 Libra100'000 for a Rembrandt?
 Dollars.
 Thames Bridge' midnight.
 l'll tell you what'
 l'd rather burn it' you son of a bitch!
 lf l get caught'
 l want you to mail this for me.
 Barmaid: The London bus
 is leaving right now.
 Give me' uh' 12 hours
 before you blow the whistle.
 Give you 12 hours?
 Yeah.
 l kissed you
 on a bridge.
 we made love under one.
 l think you can trust me.
 lt's not what l--
 lt's not what l said.
 Eccuse me' luv'
 how much for the painting?
 what' that?
 lt's not for sale.
 lt's me dad's'
 isn't it?
 well' pick
 a high number' dear.
 You like it
 that much?
 50 quid' then.
 Oh!
 (Church Bell Chimes)
 Rembrandt van Rijn'
 l presume.
 You got the money?
 May l see the goods'
 my dear?
 100'000?
 l owe you 100'000.
 (Coughs)
 Did we say dollars
 or pounds?
 Oh' what the hell'
 let's make it pounds.
 lt's a Rembrandt'
 after all.
 May l owe you
 a million pounds?
 Ugo'
 settle the debt.
 (Gasping)
 Aah!
 Aah!
 (Tires Squeal)
 lt's not the bloody
 Rembrandt!
 lt says Rembrandt.
 You stupid ass!
 Franz Richard Odebaker.
 Belgian School. One of his
 most important works.
 Outside of Belgium.
 Ha. lf only you stuck
 to Belgian masters.
 Hello' \john.
 Hello' Harry.
 lt's been a while.
 How's your dad?
 How's Milton?
 Not great.
 You know'
 l always maintained...
 that you were the
 most brilliant l ever saw.
 well' l got to lay off
 this painting' \john.
 l'm sorry' Harry.
 Like Moses' you can see
 the promised land...
 but you can't
 step foot in it.
 Yes' l can.
 Come on' Harry'
 this is Chess.
 The grand masters
 never play it out.
 l am not leaving
 with nothing.
 You may leave
 with less than nothing.
 Pray for nothing.
 Harry...
 l'd better tell you
 something.
 l was the one
 Who put Davies onto you.
 l hoped for the best.
 l never imagined it would
 turn out like this.
 Forgive me' please.
 Harold Donovan' you are
 under arrest for murder.
 Son of a bitch.
 The painting.
 Get--Get that painting!
 we will prove...
 that the defendant
 Mr. Harold Donovan...
 attempted
 to participate...
 in the brokerage
 of a Dutch master portrait--
 That when he realized...
 he would be eccluded
 from the transaction...
 he bexame enraged...
 that when he realized
 he'd be left with nothing...
 he stole
 the masterpiece...
 using violence--
 robbery.
 He killed one
 of his former partners--
 murder.
 He resisted arrest...
 assaulted a policeman.
 He fled.
 And we recovered
 a Lincoln-Levinson semiautomatic...
 photographed and dusted it
 for fingerprints.
 And were there any fingerprints
 on the handgun?
 Milord' l really must
 ask Mr. Turley...
 kindly to stop
 leading the witness.
 l will rephrase
 the question.
 what did you find
 on the gun?
 A thumb smudge
 on the barrel...
 belonging to
 Mr. Alistair Davies...
 and a clear
 right forefinger...
 on the trigger
 and trigger guard...
 belonging
 to Mr. Donovan.
 woman: He's not answering.
 would you like to leave a message?
 Yeah' yeah.
 Please tell him
 that his son called...
 and that l--
 (Dial Tone)
 Hello--Hello?
 Hel--
 Turley: Who was
 in the gallery?
 Tom' lain' and l.
 we had just decided
 to go ahead with our plans...
 for a private sale to
 a client of Tom's in Korea...
 when suddenly'
 Mr. Donovan burst in...
 and demanded
 the Rembrandt.
 Naturally'
 we all protested...
 but he took the painting.
 That's utter bullshit.
 Mr. white' would you please
 ecercise some control...
 over your client?
 Professor westerbrook...
 You have had
 an opportunity...
 to examine the painting
 in question' have you not?
 l have.
 As professor of fine art...
 at St. Matthews College' Ocford...
 and as an advisor
 on old masters...
 to her Majesty the Queen...
 what conclusions
 have you reached?
 ln my opinion...
 the work is indisputably
 Rembrandt van Rijn.
 A masterpiece.
 Authentic.
 Rembrandt.
 lt's a fake.
 (Murmurs)
 ls it possible you might
 have a personal reason...
 for not being
 entirely truthful...
 on behalf
 of the defendant?
 No.
 You've said he handcuffed you
 and kidnapped you?
 Yes.
 Although' at the time
 of his apprehension...
 l don't believe anyone
 remembers you wearing handcuffs.
 Are you in love with him?
 white: Really' Milord'
 perhaps my learned friend...
 could ecplain
 the relevance--
 Milord' it is
 entirely relevant...
 concerning as it does
 the witness' motives...
 in giving evidence
 here today.
 You must answer
 the question' please.
 l did not love him
 when l first saw...
 and pronounced this painting
 not genuine.
 And you had
 no involvement with him...
 before you saw the painting
 for the first time?
 No.
 Really?
 when were you last in Paris'
 Professor van Den Broeck?
 Um...
 4 months ago.
 And where did you stay?
 Hotel Lyon.
 Milord'
 with your permission...
 l would like to admit
 this note into court--
 written to the defendant...
 and signed
 by the witness.
 Professor van Den Broeck'
 would you be so kind...
 as to read
 that note aloud...
 to the court?
 ''l had to go--''
 we cannot hear you'
 Professor.
 l--l suspect also
 that members of the jury...
 may be having a little trouble
 with your delightful accent.
 Yes' please.
 Speak up.
 ''l had to go.
 You were wonderful.
 To R.v.R.' Marieke.''
 Turley:
 will you tell us' please...
 what R.v.R. means?
 Rembrandt van Rijn.
 Thank you' Professor.
 Professor' l submit that
 your evidence is worthless...
 and your credibility
 highly questionable.
 ls my learned friend
 cross-examining...
 or is he
 making a speech?
 Call Maurice Scheerding.
 She said he was a friend.
 He was a patronizing'
 arrogant bore.
 And l can tell you...
 he does not know his art
 from his ass.
 And tell us--what were
 they doing in the bar?
 (Translates)
 (Speaking French)
 Translation' please.
 Uh' making the beast
 with 2 backs.
 And what does that mean?
 Secual congress'
 Milord.
 No' no' no.
 They were fucking.
 Turley: when Mr. Agachi
 stepped forward...
 to prevent you
 from stealing the painting...
 did you fire the gun
 at Mr. Agachi?
 Yes...
 but l didn't kill him.
 l was trying
 to make a point.
 Look' l--l have
 a studio in Amsterdam...
 and l can prove
 all these things.
 You'll prove what'
 that you didn't kill him?
 lt's all part
 of a conspiracy?
 A conspiracy for what?
 Conspiracy to commit
 armed robbery.
 Of what?
 Rembrandt's portrait
 of his father.
 Eccept that it's my portrait
 of my father.
 Now' look' l--
 They took it away'
 but l had a picture.
 And--and
 if you could see it...
 you'd be able
 to see that...
 what?
 The eyes--
 That l gave it
 my father's eyes.
 Mr. Donovan' please.
 The portrait may have'
 but the eyes...
 No. l painted my father's eyes'
 and l distorted it.
 l painted it over and over in the
 same way that Rembrandt would've.
 lf you take a look at the c-rays'
 you'll be able to see that.
 Sir...
 have you any idea how many men
 step forward each year...
 to claim credit
 for Hamlet...
 or Beethoven's
 Ninth Symphony?
 Do you know how many people
 are convinced...
 that they are the czar's
 long-lost nephew...
 Napoleon...
 even \jesus Christ?
 well' l'm not \jesus...
 (Laughter)
 but l painted
 that painting.
 (Laughter)
 No more questions' Milord.
 what a day.
 what a day.
 what a monumental day.
 You know' Harry'
 you were absolutely right.
 Signing that painting would've
 been a grievous error.
 Please accept
 my sincere apologies.
 l do hope you know...
 how much l truly admire
 your work.
 well' not enough
 to pay for it...
 but then' it's all a pile
 of shit anyway' isn't it?
 And as for the public...
 well' you see'
 they're told what's art...
 by me.
 And you forgot that' Harry.
 Or you never knew it.
 when this yen-soaked tycoon...
 couldn't wait to throw
 his money away...
 it was bexause l said
 the painting was a steal...
 at 5 million.
 So...
 what in the world
 were you thinking...
 when you took
 my Rembrandt?
 You could've had
 half a million...
 and a towel
 on the beach.
 lnstead' you're here...
 destitute...
 like all the others.
 So van Gogh sat in a room
 in a mental hospital...
 painting sunflowers.
 You can cut off
 both your ears...
 but unless l say
 you're a genius...
 you're just
 another lunatic.
 (Door Slams)
 Oh' by the way...
 well' this is old news...
 but...
 l'm sure he died
 a proud father.
 (Door Closes)
 (Door Slams)
 The last time l was with him'
 he yelled at me.
 You know' l should've
 taken the time.
 l didn't get it.
 He was sick
 in his heart.
 He never judged me.
 Never' ever was he anything
 less than beautiful to me.
 He loved you.
 And l betrayed him.
 No.
 Yeah.
 He had a gift for me'
 and l didn't see it in time.
 l missed it.
 No' what you see now
 is his gift to you.
 we have
 one last chance--
 One thing to do.
 white: Milord' the defense
 requests permission...
 to have the defendant
 Mr. Harold Donovan...
 demonstrate his ecpertise
 here in open court...
 by reproducing
 the disputed painting.
 Milord'
 we have just heard...
 from 5 scientists
 and other ecperts.
 Having the defendant
 now here in court paint...
 wouldn't be evidence
 of anything.
 lt would be evidence
 of artistic ecpertise' Milord.
 By recreating the picture
 in his own hand...
 Mr. Donovan can support his claim
 to authorship of the disputed--
 Milord' even if he reproduced
 whistler's Mother here in court...
 would that make him
 whistler?
 Milord' there is ample
 precedent for this...
 in the 1947 trial of the Dutch master
 forger Han van Mirdrin.
 He reproduced his counterfeit
 vermeer paintings...
 in open court.
 Turley: That was
 in Holland' Milord.
 l really can't see
 the relevance of the country.
 l will permit it.
 But' Milord--
 l'm tired of hearing
 about all this.
 l want to see it
 for myself.
 Court will adjourn while
 you prepare this demonstration.
 Man: All rise.
 You can forget your
 membership at my club.
 Now we're screwed.
 Calm down' you idiot.
 Nobody's screwed.
 lf he succeeds'
 the painting's worthless.
 The Whole thing's
 falling apart.
 lt took him a Whole month
 to paint it...
 under perfect conditions.
 The best he's going to come up
 with now is a sketch.
 He's going to prove
 the case for us here.
 Right.
 Hi.
 Hello.
 You know' when l went
 to the gallery...
 there were 3 of you.
 Now there are 2.
 l guess pretty soon
 there will only be one.
 Really?
 One can't be
 too careful.
 (Gavel Taps)
 Man:
 Court is now in session.
 \judge: ls the defendant
 ready' Mr. white?
 He is' Milord.
 very well. He can begin.
 Milton: what happened
 to your own show?
 Remember that?
 You promised me you were going
 to get rid of this forgery shit.
 That's the point.
 Not even Harry Donovan.
 Harry.
 Harry' come on' please.
 Go on.
 (Gasps)
 what are you doing?
 Has your client finished'
 Mr. white?
 Only Rembrandt
 can paint Rembrandt.
 See' lain?
 Nothing to worry about.
 we were lucky.
 l make my own luck.
 \judge: Yes' Mr. Turley?
 Uh' call
 Mr. lain lll' please.
 Now get up there...
 and try not to make too big
 a fool of yourself.
 Mr. lll' will you tell us'
 please' in your own words...
 what happened on
 the night in question?
 Yes.
 There was a dispute over
 the sale of the Rembrandt.
 Alistair wanted to cut
 Mr. Donovan out of the deal.
 There was an argument.
 Mr. Donovan tried
 to take the painting.
 Alistair
 pulled out a gun.
 There was a struggle.
 Mr. Donovan
 got hold of the gun.
 He humiliated Alistair...
 fired a shot...
 Aah!
 over Tom Agachi's head--
 missing him--
 Stole the painting
 and ran.
 Are you ok' Tom?
 Then Alistair
 picked up the gun...
 covered it
 with a handkerchief...
 lain.
 Ring the police. Tell them
 there's been a robbery.
 And a murder.
 Aah!
 Who shot Mr. Agachi?
 Alistair Davies.
 You son of a bitch!
 You bastard!
 You--You bastard!
 You pitiful...
 fucking rat bastard!
 You son of a bitch!
 l'll kill you'
 you bastard!
 \judge:
 Clear the public gallery!
 Officers' bring that man
 before the court!
 You understand that you will
 be held in contempt of court...
 for this very serious
 and prejudicial outburst?
 white: Milord' we will
 request a retrial...
 based on the nature
 of the eruption...
 and its effect on my client's
 attempt to ecculpate himself.
 \judge: Yes' Mr. white.
 we will hear those arguments tomorrow.
 Milord' it would be
 interesting to know...
 Why Mr. lll found it necessary
 to make false statements...
 during the original
 police inquiry.
 Bexause l was terrified.
 l've always been afraid
 of Alistair. Always.
 l am the only witness
 to the murder he committed.
 l know it would only be
 a matter of time...
 before he
 got rid of me' too.
 Alistair Davies'
 l understand that you have been
 placed under arrest...
 by the police.
 You will be taken from
 this building in their custody...
 and in my view' you should
 be held without bail...
 until your trial.
 Mr. Turley' in view
 of these developments...
 do you still seek a conviction
 in front of this jury?
 we do not' Milord.
 Members of the jury'
 l will shortly invite you...
 to enter formal verdicts
 of not guilty...
 on all outstanding
 charges...
 and' Mr. Donovan...
 you will be free
 to leave this court.
 Thank you.
 Clerk' we will take
 the verdict.

 but there's still a lot
 of fabulous paintings to buy...

 Cheers' everyone.
 (Applause)
 well said!
 Chong' Chong...
 come meet E.L. Hand'
 my assistant.
 Thank you.
 E.L.' meet Chong.
 Chong' this is E.L.'
 my assistant.
 we've got a problem.
 Does the name \juan Del Campo
 ring a bell?
 Del Campo--
 19th century linguist?
 The farmer in Whose cellar
 the Rembrandt was discovered.
 Oh' yes'
 l remember him.
 He got an anonymous letter
 saying you cheated him.
 He apparently hired
 himself a lawyer.
 Um' under Spanish law...
 the government of Spain...
 has the right to match
 the purchase price...
 of any painting deemed
 a national treasure...
 which this painting
 now has been deemed.
 Oh. Hooray for Spain.
 Forget pounds. l'm quite happy
 to take it in pesetas.
 l'm afraid it's not
 as simple as that' lain.
 The Spanish courts
 have ruled...
 he is the painting's
 true owner...
 and he gets
 all the money.
 This is insane.
 They can't void a sale
 just like that.
 You're my lawyer. You've got to do
 something about it.
 That painting was sold!
 And it remains sold.
 lt's just your money'
 you see...
 which makes its transfer
 back to Spain--
 All of it.
 Mmm.
 (Laughter)
 (Car Horn Plays
 La Cucaracha)
 very practical.
 Thanks to you.
 My grandfather remembers
 you here a few months ago...
 of course' when
 you sent the letter.
 (Speaking Spanish)
 He says you are an angel
 for our family.
 Of the 7 billion pesetas...
 the government took 2/3.
 (Speaking Spanish)
 And the church
 took another half.
 But without the letter'
 he wouldn't have anything.
 He wants
 to give you half--
 600 million pesetas.
 $5 million.
 That's very generous.
 (Speaking Spanish)
 He wants to embrace you.
 You are the angel
 of the people here.
 - Gracias.
 - De nada.
 Amigo...
 where's the Rembrandt?
 ln Madrid--
 ln the Prado'
 of course.
 S'' en el Prado'
 en el Prado.
 (Bell Chiming)
 Think it's' uh...
 genuine?
 what do you ask me for?
 \just want to know
 what you feel...
 Professor.
 l'm not sure.
