[chanting the Hanuman
Chalisa prayer]
Hail Lord Rama!
Hail Hanuman!
Stand in queue...
one behind the other.
Praise the Lord.
Yes, how many of you?
Stand in queue as per
your delivery date.
...nine months pregnant,
come forward.
Behind her stand... eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two and one.
And women who are trying
to get pregnant,
eat tikkis first,
you'll be served golgappas later.
I'm due in two weeks,
serve me quickly.
How many times does the baby move?
Three or four times.
Get admitted in the hospital
by day after.
You'll deliver in
the next four days.
Here you go.
Lala, will eating these golgappas
guarantee a son?
What do you want?
For a mere 25 rupees,
you want golgappas
and a certificate too!
If the government can't
give you a guarantee...
nor can ministers,
doctors and engineers...
You want a golgappa-seller
to give you guarantee?
- Gaffar...
- Yes?
- Take his bowl away.
- Give it back.
I'm just confirming...
Go stand right at the back.
Get lost.
You mean, it may not be a boy?
Come on, I'd heard so much
about you, Lala.
I just satisfy the cravings of pregnant
women like my forefathers did.
I don't grant boys...
God does.
Aunty, eat this with faith,
you'll have a son.
Even this 70 year-old board says -
'Eat chaat here and a
son will be born'.
You need to believe.
- Come forward.
- Please stand aside.
Seven months pregnant women
come forward.
You can't park here, mister.
Drop the lady off here...
park your scooter over there.
Durga didi is calling.
Yes?
What? The boy's family has arrived?
So early?
Weren't they supposed
to come in the afternoon?
Okay... make them comfortable...
Yes, I'm wearing my slippers.
No... listen...
Let the guests eat the samosas
Don't eat them yourself!
Take it.
- Manage the shop.
- Sure.
We haven't eaten yet, Lala...
Madam, the golgappas ensure a son.
I don't...
He will serve you golgappas.
But I'll have a boy, right?
We're all after boys...
you want one and I want four!
Take this. Serve them.
Don't forget to take money.
Satinder, give me a kurta.
I'm sure this boy will be
a good match, brother.
I hope so.
Lala... take some sweets with you.
And milk?
Don't need it today.
- I'll pay you later.
- No problem.
Make way...
Lala, the boy's family is here.
- You better hurry.
- Lala... listen....
Laxmi took some gram flour.
Adjust from my rent or pay me now?
You pay a measly 275 rupees and
you want to deduct 25
rupees from that too!
Why even bother with the 250!
Lala, return my mother's bangles.
Get lost, you rascal!
I refuse to pay you any money.
Your son takes all the bottles
of cold water from my house.
There... I've adjusted your money.
Get lost.
Paying a measly 275 rupees
and you want the world at your feet!
Brother-in-law is here.
Go take a bath, boy.
Madam Durga...
Doesn't any brand
sell clothes your size?
Brother...
Are you wearing a child's t-shirt?
This has shrunk after a wash!
Give this to me.
Why don't you shrink too,
after a bath?
Geeta, take this.
Move.
Please wear something that
glows in the dark, Laxmi.
Hello... I'm not that dark-skinned!
And don't smile in the dark...
only your teeth will be visible!
Oh, sorry...
I'm so sorry, Uncle.
Our neighborhood is so crowded,
couldn't get here sooner...
- I'm sorry, Aunty.
- No problem.
I'm sorry.
What is this behavior, Lala?
Already making the
groom's family wait?
Please excuse me, Aunty.
Thankfully, so many pregnant women,
- wait at my shop every morning...
- At your shop?
It's more like I'm
running a hospital.
Will eating golgappas at your shop
guarantee a son?
I only promise a son but
in my grandfather's times
all boys grew up to
be officers too.
Gayatri...
Please serve them tea.
Neeraj was born after eating
golgappas served by your father.
I see...
I can see that...
boys born after eating
at our shop stand out.
Is that your younger brother?
The one wearing a jacket.
No. She is my youngest sister,
- Saraswati.
- Oh.
- Do you watch action films?
- No.
She does,
that's why she's like this.
Come here...
All my sisters are named
after goddesses, Uncle.
But I swear on my dead mother,
she's the most dutiful one.
The most obedient one.
You can keep the tray.
Excuse me.
Yes... okay.
Brother, Saharanpur has
lifted the milestone!
- They're offering 12.
- 12?
- They're offering 12.
- Who is he?
My brother-in-law.
Wow, they're offering 12.
But when I spoke to
the priest, he said 11.
12... okay, fine...
I don't have a problem.
No problem!
- Put the tray down.
- Hold! Hold!
Yes... okay.
The milestone has been lifted again.
They're offering 14 now, plus a
honeymoon package via Vaishno Devi.
Hail the goddess!
But...We had agreed
upon 11, then 12...
and now 14?
Okay, Mr. Gupta...
I agree to 14.
There goes my college fee.
...no more, please.
- Put the tray down.
- One minute...
the milestone...
I'll break your head
with that milestone!
Enough!
14.25...
That's it! Final!
It's decided!
Put the tray down.
Wait a minute.
16 is the new milestone.
Brother...
Keep quiet, you rascal.
I'll give you a few thousand...
stop talking.
- Put the tray down, Gayatri.
- One minute...
The Saharanpur party is offering
me 1 lakh, plus a tuxedo.
Mr Gupta, let's seal the deal
at 16 lakhs (hundred thousand).
16, final!
- Put the tray--
- 17.
Shut up, you rascal!
I'd have to rob a bank
to get 17 lakhs, Mr. Gupta.
I would've managed for one sister
but I have four!
Mr. Kedarnath...
I paid dowry for my daughter,
hence I want dowry for my son.
We have a long day ahead...
let's go.
They don't have any money!
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
Bye.
You!
Let go of my samosa
Let go.
Take a video of this.
I won't let you have it.
Take this.
Eat it! You too!
Eat it! You too!
You witch! Mummy...
I won't give it.
Witch!
My samosa!
Promise me, Kedarnath...
till you get your four
sisters married...
you won't get married.
Promise me.
I promise you...
Only after getting my
four sisters married...
will I think of getting married.
Papa, please...
Why are you being so petty?
Kedara would've told us
had the match had been finalized.
- No. I want to humiliate him.
- What?
I want to insult him
in front of everyone.
He should know what it's like to
be burdened with a young daughter!
'Burden'?
Are you saying
I'm a burden, Papa?
You're not a burden to me, child.
I worry about your marriage.
Tell me...
how long will you wait for this guy?
First he'll marry
off ALL his sisters...
and only then he'll marry you!
This dutiful son is honoring
his promise to his mother...
but I'm the one paying
a price for it!
How long will I have to wait
to get my daughter married?
I'm not that old...
You're not, but he is.
How long will he go around
pretending to be young?
We'll have to come to a decision!
I'll decide who gets the samosa.
I'm the eldest--
Kedarnath!
Here comes Sapna's father, enjoy!
Kedarnath, come out.
It hasn't even been 10
minutes since they left...
who informs him?
Where are you, Kedara?
Saraswati...
tell him I've left.
Tell him...
Don't say that I've
gone to the shop,
else he'll land up there.
- Don't tell him.
- Kedarnath!
Namaste, Uncle.
Namaste, sister-in-law.
Let her become your
sister-in-law before
you call her that.
Did you finalize Gayatri's wedding?
What did the boy's family say?
They left within 15-20 minutes.
They were asking for 17 lakhs.
See. I told you so.
Tell me...
where's your dear brother?
He has... gone to the bank!
Look at how that rascal has
taught this poor child to lie.
What does he even have in
that bank, to withdraw from?
- Papa.
- Be quiet.
Tell me the truth.
Where's your brother?
It's the truth... he has left.
He left right after the
boy's family did.
- Go...
- Rascal...
Witch!
...building a nest here.
Where do you think you're
running away like a fugitive?
Who's running away?
I'm going to the doctor.
I have a blister right here.
Saraswati said you've
gone to the bank.
I had gone to the bank
to withdraw money
to pay the doctor's fees.
Then what are you doing up there?
There's a nest here
with a crippled duck...
I was feeding it.
You're such a liar.
Have a conscience.
You couldn't finalize
Gayatri's marriage...
all four of your
sisters are unmarried...
when will you get them married?
When will I get my daughter married?
Just see...
how rudely your father is talking.
See for yourself.
What?
What was so rude, Kedarnath -
'Have a conscience'?
'Gayatri's marriage'?
Talk of our marriage
or of having a young daughter?
Tell me.
What was so rude?
Are you on his side now?
Don't you earn enough
feeding golgappas to all...
pregnant women?
Can't you afford a 17 lakh
dowry for your sister?
You think you'll take this money
with you after you die?
What money are you talking about?
I pay 15 lakhs to
the bank every month.
You think I'm running away?
If Sapna wasn't my
childhood sweetheart,
I would've run away by now.
Really?
Really?! Come on.
Why don't you tell your father
about the EMI's that I pay?
- EMI for what?
- 'EMI for what'?!
He is asking me about my EMIs.
Please tell him...
Everyone in Chandni
Chowk knows, Harishankar.
During World War II, Lala's
grandfather had a contract
- to supply chickpeas to the Germans.
- Hear him...
and he'd taken a loan of
20 lakhs from the bank...
Lala is still paying off the loan.
If his grandfather hadn't
been cheated by Hitler...
his family would've owned
this entire neighborhood.
'Chickpeas'?
And who is Hitler?
'Who is Hitler'?
The very same German Hitler!
The one who stands like this!
The very same Hitler.
He's the reason your daughter
is still unmarried.
Hitler is dead but
I'm still alive...
I'm retiring in eight months...
...and I want her
settled before that.
You have six months...
Marry her or I'll marry her
off to someone else.
And you can forget
about your sweetheart.
Idiot.
Let's go.
Hitler my foot!
Come.
Let's go.
And what about my promise
to my mother?
Fulfill it.
You don't have much time...
get all four sisters married
and then marry Sapna.
Take some money to get
your blister treated.
...talking about Hitler.
36 thousand in July...
34 thousand in August.
Nothing in September?
We only get what
is destined, Brother.
Mine... that of my sisters...
and your destiny too is
to be blamed for this.
Come here...
Sit.
Your destiny is not to blame.
My ledgers are to blame for this.
You're my pride.
It's these boys who are unlucky,
not you.
How will you manage, Brother?
Even if you manage to
put together my dowry...
you still have three
more to take care of.
Do you know what Ma would say?
She'd say - Lord Mahadev
takes care of all daughters.
He will provide for us.
Why do you worry?
Silly girl...
There's no love like this...
There's no love like this...
There's no jealousy like this!
If a sister asks her
brother for something...
He'd take a life...
Not 'take a life'
he'd give up his life.
There's no love like this...
Praise the Lord...
Praise the Almighty.
...there's more stuff.
I like the boy.
Go. Come next week.
But... why?
I know of boys like him...
they get famous on TikTok.
I'll get you married to him.
He's a scrap dealer!
He'd come to pay for the cupboard.
Fine, get me married to him...
Coloring his hair
and fooling everyone...
- Give me 500 rupees, Brother.
- Why?
Did you lend it to me?
I have to go to college.
Do you have to pay
to enter the college?
I'll take a taxi...
Take a bus.
No way. I'll take a taxi.
Else everyone will know that I come
from a lower middle class family.
I'll drop you off.
No, I want to take a taxi.
Brother... drop me to
my tuition class on the way.
Wait...
drop me to my dance class too.
Let's go.
You're always asking me for money.
I need to buy laboratory stuff
for my Chemistry practical.
Why do you need to buy them?
Steal them.
Watch out!
You want your sister to steal?
Sister? You're witches.
All of you.
And I want you to become robbers.
Wow...
Where are you going?
She looked at me.
Crazy boys.
Fine, they're whistling at you two.
I wish I was in that jeep.
Keep quiet.
What's wrong?
Get off.
But why?
- Get off, I need to do something important.
- But...
Take 500 rupees and take a taxi.
- Go.
- I can't believe this.
Take a taxi.
Be careful.
Auto.
- Whistling at girls?!
- Hey...
- But...
- I just whistled, what was so wrong?
Grab him. Don't let him go!
I just called a fat girl Fatty...
I'll call your mother Fatty.
Will you like it?
Feel the heat?
It's hot.
Should've told me!
Lala...
Let me go.
Let go of me.
- Move.
- He will die.
Get lost!
Forget it, Lala.
Will you kill him for such
a small thing?
'Small thing'?
'Small thing'?
Do you really think
it's a 'small thing'?
Move it to the center of the road.
Wait, let me get up!
Move this!
Wait!
Stop.
People of Chandni Chowk, listen
...to three things.
Pay attention.
First...
four-wheelers aren't allowed
to enter Chandni Chowk.
Second...
all boys in Delhi will have
to control themselves.
Else, I'll thrash them.
I'll beat the living
daylight out of them.
Third...
if any boy harasses a girl,
he will have to marry her.
- Well said, Lala.
- Get it?
I will make sure he marries her.
Get it?
They think they'll catcall
and get away with it!
Where's my slipper?
Tastes okay.
Add more lemon juice.
I like it.
One more, brother-in-law.
Come on, really?
You've already eaten a lot.
These golgappas are very spicy,
you'll have a tough time
tomorrow morning.
Leave.
- Kedara...
- What?
You didn't stand up to
your father for me yesterday.
What could I have said?
Papa was right.
What was he so right about?
He is retiring in eight months.
Focus on your precious sisters...
never mind me!
Lala...
Move aside...
- Lala.
- What is it?
Here is your invitation card.
Invitation?
Chandramukhi is getting
married next week.
Please come to the party tomorrow...
bring only one sister along.
Chandramukhi is getting married?
Yes.
Hear that?
Chandramukhi is getting married.
Who is she getting married to?
A boy, of course.
He is a government clerk.
Is he a normal, regular guy?
Yes.
- A widower?
- No.
It's his first marriage.
Dowry?
Not much.
Who is the matchmaker?
There's a wedding manager,
Ms. Shaanu.
She can find a match for any girl,
at a nominal cost.
The lady who runs
Saubhagyashaali Wedding?
Yes, her.
With the tagline -
'Your daughter, my headache'?
Correct.
- Do you know of her?
- Of course.
She has called us so many
times to cater at weddings.
- And what did you say?
- I refused.
We don't have time
for all this, Lala!
Such an intelligent boy.
Listen... hand me my slippers.
I told her,
we don't cater at weddings...
it's through us that the Lord
blesses pregnant women.
Where to?
Idiot...You've kept me from
meeting this amazing lady!
Did you forget?
We have four sisters...
Sapna, we have to meet this lady
tomorrow and take her help.
Okay?
What is it?
When you looked at me
I fell in love
I fell madly in love 
Sapna...
this Undertaker
is Chandramukhi.
If Ms. Shaanu can find
a match for her,
she'll find someone
for my sisters as well.
Gaffar deserved a thrashing.
Ms. Chandramukhi...
where's your father?
I think that's Ms. Shaanu.
Madam, I am Lala Kedarnath Agarwal.
Take this.
She is my fianc*e...
And...
She is Sapna.
We've come from very far,
with a request.
I have a shop nearby -
'Premlata Chaat Bhandar'.
But you said you've come from far.
Actually, the shop is nearby...
But the request
is a far-fetched one.
What's the name of your shop?
'Premlata Chaat Bhandar'
Oh, I see...
- you're that pompous Kedarnath.
- No, ma'am.
How could he possibly be pompous
with four unmarried sisters...
There's a stupid boy
who works at the shop,
he didn't recognize you.
We'll set up a stall
wherever you want.
Isn't it, Kedara?
I have four sisters...
I can't get married until they do.
If I don't get married, nor can she.
Correct.
All our lives will get ruined.
See...
Later, child.
It's not a big deal for you.
- I need four grooms.
- Move aside.
Please see if you could help...
nothing too expensive...
Wait...
- I'll try.
- Please, listen...
Hold her.
Kids, be careful!
- Listen...
- Yes?
Are you free tomorrow evening?
Er... I'll work something out.
I'm not asking you out on a date
only to cater at an event.
Of course, I can...
Send me the address, I'll be there.
Bring your sisters with you.
Sure.
Good night.
I won't give you money.
Do you want an ice cream?
Hello?
- Have you reached?
- Yes, we're at the entrance.
Why can't I see you?
- Where?
- There he is.
Yes. Come here.
Take a look at them.
Why are you three dressed like this?
Why? Don't we look good?
'Look good'? Rubbish.
She's looking like a clown.
Go, stand with those
clowns over there.
And you...
why are you wearing a chessboard?
Go, stand in that corner.
Your multi-colored dress...
looks like someone has spat on it!
Come on, we're looking good.
Why don't you introduce
us to Ms. Shaanu.
You want to meet Ms. Shaanu?
Want to ruin her business?
Silly girl...
Go, make yourselves scarce.
Gayatri, come with me.
You too, Sapna.
My son had told you,
he wants an expensive car.
Why are you arguing about this now?
You're absolutely right.
It's a national holiday today,
that's why the car
wasn't delivered today.
But I've already booked the car,
sent you the papers as well.
Just hear his excuse...
Since Mr. Uppal has
sent us the papers,
he's suggesting...
we make a paper boat
with those papers...
and take our son home in that!
Mr. Uppal, after all...
a deal is a deal.
Papa, I've told my friends
I'll bring my wife home
in an expensive car!
Sir, listen to me.
This man is requesting
you with folded hands...
it's a national holiday,
the car showroom is closed today,
You'll get your car tomorrow!
Really...
you're being too greedy.
What did you just say?
Greedy? Are you calling me greedy?
No, sir.
She didn't mean it like that.
I don't care, Mr. Uppal.
Gaffar, that man who'd
come with sweets...
after having a son...
- Doesn't he own Rastogi Trading?
- Yes...
call him.
Now?
Either get the car right now or
get this woman to apologize!
Really?
Mr. Rastogi, thank you for
helping us at this hour.
The money...
Take the car...
we'll discuss this later.
- Thank you so much.
- No need to thank me.
After three daughters...
thanks to your golgappas,
I finally have an heir.
Take the keys... go.
Let them call off the wedding.
My name is Shaanu.
I don't apologize to anyone
and definitely not to them.
Please, Ms. Shaanu...
apologize to them.
Else they'll call off the wedding.
Why are you so worried?
Let them leave.
I'll find other grooms
for your daughter.
Don't worry, I'll do something.
Let's leave!
Angad, bro...
Here's your brand new car.
Look, the car is here!
It's yours! Take it away.
Here's the duplicate key.
- God bless you!
- Never mind.
Let the celebrations begin!
Ms. Shaanu, I am always
there to help you.
You don't need to apologize to them.
They wanted a car,
they've got it
...look at those fools dance.
Thank you.
Well done, Lala.
Here you put in so much effort
all I get are excuses.
I'm not even asking for a car.
Gift me a bangle and I'm yours.
I've given you my heart
My love.
More precious than my life
Is your acceptance of my love
Like a silken thread...
I will gift you a ruby
bangle, my love
I will gift you a ruby
bangle, my love
Your beautiful smile
Makes me fall in love with you
You are what I desire
Say you'll be mine
Like a silken thread...
I will gift you a ruby
bangle, my love
You bring love and light
Wherever you go
You spread beauty
All around
I can lay down my life for you
You are magic
I can lay down my life for you
You are my true love
I declare to the world
You are my destiny
Like a silken thread...
I will gift you a ruby
bangle, my love
I will gift you a ruby
bangle, my love
That's dog food.
Ms. Shaanu,
I have four sisters to wed...
I deserve a discount.
Come on...
I've already given you a discount.
20 lakhs include the dowry
and my commission.
20 lakhs per wedding is too much.
With the variety
that you've brought...
this gangster-girl...
this pitch-dark one...
this double-decker...
I deserve twice the commission.
Consider this...
20 lakhs per girl...
adds up to a total of 80 lakhs.
I'll need another 10 lakhs for
the wedding arrangements--
Fine.
I'll work something out.
I'll get her married first
for 18 lakhs.
Alright?
But you'll have to work
on the others.
Stop her from eating.
Stop her from going out in the sun.
And this one... Van Damme...
We'll have to turn
her into 'Damn Hot'.
Sorry.
- Sapna?
- Yes.
- Aren't you Harishankar's daughter?
- Yes.
Why are you wasting your time here?
Go and get ready...
there's a boy coming
to meet you in two days.
I've arranged the match.
What?
I'm the boy she's marrying.
She pesters me to marry her.
Who asked you to
find a match for her?
Her father did.
He wants her to get
married before he retires.
He has already paid my fees.
- Oh, she's an unfaithful one!
- Oh, she's an unfaithful one!
- She didn't really love you
- She didn't really love you
Keep quiet!
...I can save 15 lakhs.
It adds up to 60 lakhs...
Stop mumbling to yourself, Lala.
Look at these account books.
See if you've inherited...
a house, shop or even a brothel
that you can sell.
'Brothel'?
This is an antique
chair, sister-in-law.
Should sell for five thousand.
If I sell you along with this chair,
it'll still not sell
for five thousand!
- This fool wants to sell a chair!
- One minute...
Why would my ancestors
buy a brothel?
Lala, sell these too!
You...
Get lost!
Sister-in-law...
we'll get two thousand
at least for this.
Keep it back!
I got this tailored for him
to wear at our wedding.
How dare you touch it!
It's been eight years already.
It's an antique now...
sell it.
You know what, Lala...
your sisters don't want
us to get married.
What do you want?
Want me to wear this?
Fine.
I'll wear this sherwani.
Happy?
Wear this and sit at home
for the next 20 years.
I don't care.
Tell me,
when are we getting married?
As soon as my sisters
get married, so will we.
Getting these girls married?!
These girls?
All the girls in the city will get
married but not them
not them
because they don't
want to get married!
Don't say that, Sapna.
They're my sisters not strangers.
you're only concerned
about your sisters.
I've been waiting to marry
you since we were kids...
but you're only concerned
about your sisters.
Sapna... don't cry.
Go away.
She'll go on a diet from tomorrow.
You'll eat just one leaf
from tomorrow.
One leaf!
Laxmi, you'll marinate
yourself in fairness cream!
Get it? I'll make sure she
becomes fair-skinned.
And... this girl is perfect!
And she'll be a child-bride!
Happy?
Please don't cry.
Excuse me, Mr. Lala...
I love my body.
Big is beautiful.
I love the color of my skin.
Black is back!
Mark my words, Lala.
These girls don't
want to get married.
They only want to pout and
take photos for Instagram.
What gram?
Irritating man!
You just stand here
and do nothing!
We can't get married
because of these witches.
I'll go and marry that other boy.
I'll agree to marry him.
You carry on with this nonsense.
Sapna...
Let go!
Sapna!
Are you happy now, you witches?
Happy now?
Got what you wanted?
Lala, what will we get for this?
Shit.
Want to eat it?
Who eats shit?
You... sell me instead!
Just see.
We won't get anything
if we sell you...
selling your kidney
might fetch a few hundred--
Shut up!
It's just a suggestion.
Lala... wait up.
Stop laughing, all of you.
This is a serious matter.
We'll have to handle
Sapna's problem...
I'll take the lead now.
Get it?
Sir...
please have some snacks.
You haven't eaten any...
- try some, they're delicious.
- Sure.
Mr. Harishankar,
I see you're serving
snacks to your guests.
Send some over to us as well.
Sapna is our
sister-in-law after all!
Namaste, sister-in-law.
I'm here, you dog.
So?
This is not enough.
Exactly, this is not enough.
Lala, go and speak to the people
you're paying the EMIs to...
the bank.
Ask them to either forego the money
or to lend you some more.
Sit.
These girls are a nuisance.
She's not their sister-in-law.
Lala and she are childhood
friends. Friends!
Sure! I've seen them play
'doctor-patient' as kids.
She's lying.
Harishankar, a man and
a woman can never be friends.
It's a facade...
for what goes on in their pulsating
bodies on hot, steamy nights.
What rubbish are you saying?
- 'Pulsating bodies'?
- 'Hot, steamy nights'?
What rubbish.
This is a line from a film, sir.
- I'll give you a tight slap!
- Really?
Please do something, Mr. Dua.
If you can't give me a loan,
pause the repayment of the
old one for some time.
Come on, Lala.
It's not possible.
Tell you what.
You should run away.
Go and start your life afresh.
You think he'll help if
you're so casual?
Rubbish.
Look sad, broken from inside...
like a dead man.
Yes. Like this!
And add some... tears.
What is she doing?
If you marry our sister-in-law,
take our brother along too.
He'll sleep between these two.
If you separate childhood lovers,
you'll burn in hell, you rascal.
What nonsense!
Do you even realize
what you're saying?
Kedara, only if your
mortgage your shop
can I give you money.
I can't give you any money for this.
Leave.
Keep this back.
Get anything?
Nothing.
It didn't work.
How insulting!
It's not what you think...
- Let's go.
- Mr. Dinanath...
- So insulting...
- Madam...
Move.
What have you done?!
Just wait and watch what I do.
Get lost, Harishankar.
I don't care.
I'll teach them a lesson.
- Forget it, Papa.
- The entire family is crazy.
You were awesome!
What was that?
Our Gayatri is unstoppable.
Nobody tell Brother about this.
Hurry up, let's go home.
[singing devotional songs]
Gaffar, what're you waiting for?
Get the yoghurt.
Hello...
do you have any idea how
much this guy makes
by singing at these gatherings?
How much?
One lakh.
- One lakh?
- That too in five hours.
How much do we make,
serving chaat to hundreds of people?
Only 20 thousand.
Think about it, Lala.
Don't waste your time.
Brother...
Your work is done.
We drove that boy's family away.
The ones who'd come to meet Sapna.
Come on, smile.
If you serve chaat
with this expression,
they'll surely fall sick.
Don't worry, Brother.
They will work hard on
themselves to get married.
Durga goes on a diet from tomorrow.
We'll try and improve
her complexion...
and we'll fix her somehow.
You just relax.
As for me, I love my body...
but I'll do it for you.
Let's eat golagappas to celebrate.
[singing devotional songs]
Get ready, Gaffar.
We'll serve them chaat
and entertain them as well.
Morning and evening
I sing your praises
Morning and evening
I sing your praises
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
I've prayed countless times"
But I've been disappointed so far"
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
Consider my case
And grant my wish
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
I'm not asking for the impossible
It's not something you can't do
All I ask for is to
be pretty and slim
Make me hot as well
Give me your blessings
I'm here to ask for your help
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
Your photo is my Insta DP
I sing your praises
With much fanfare
You and I both know
I'm your biggest follower
Please answer my prayers
Please answer my prayers
Dowry is a social crime.
It is the bane of
every woman's life.
And it is because of this custom,
- people aren't happy at the birth of a daughter
- Be quiet...
while the birth of a
son is celebrated.
This is why daughters
are neglected...
Who is this woman?
Why isn't she letting me sleep?
Is she crazy?
- ...they're seen as a burden.
- Lala, she's here every month...
- ...second Monday of every month.
- From the moment she's born,
- ...her father is burdened with.
- with the same anti-dowry speech.
Both, taking dowry and
giving dowry is a crime.
I've explained this
to you earlier but
I've found out, dowry was given
in Chandramukhi's wedding.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
We have to stop this custom.
Well said, madam.
Do you have children, madam?
- I do.
- How many?
- Two.
- Boys? Or girls?
Two girls.
Two girls, that's why
you're against the
custom of giving dowry.
If you had two boys...
your opinion would've
been different.
Of course a girl's mother will
say that giving dowry is bad.
If it was a boy's
mother saying this,
I'd take it seriously.
Am I right?
I have four sisters, madam.
I'm breaking my back
for their dowry.
We haven't started
this custom anyway.
It's been going on for generations
that's why we're continuing with it.
Shouldn't this change?
Who will bring about the change?
You? With your speeches here?
This is Chandni Chowk, madam.
Chandni Chowk.
A mini India.
Every house here has a daughter
whose dowry is falling short.
But hoping to give them a lavish
wedding their families slave away.
Now you want them to be
ashamed of their hard work?
Madam, every man standing here...
is working tirelessly
so that he can give his
daughter a lavish wedding.
You want us to be ashamed of this?
We won't.
We love our sisters
and daughters dearly.
We can lay down
our lives for them.
See how much I've
managed to put together...
a flat-screen TV,
washing machine,
microwave, cupboard,
sofa, double-bed--
Lala...
it's Shaanu.
- Hello...
- Hello, Lala?
What are you doing?
Do it properly.
I want to speak to you.
Reach my office in ten minutes.
I'll be there soon.
What happened?
Are you sleepy?
Welcome, Lala.
Your sister is getting married
on the 27th of next month.
Start the wedding preparations.
My sister?
Bless you.
Thank you so much.
The bride was all bedecked
The bride will be bedecked
Hiding his tears,
your brother will smile
And see you off, and say
I am there with you
I am there with you
I am there with you
I am there with you
You're getting married.
Toys of our childhood
call out to you
Let's play with them once again
Let's relive those moments
Of carefree days gone by
Those cold, wintry nights
Those carefree days
When fights were short-lived
So were our arguments
It seems just like yesterday
Why did we even grow up?
Let's relive those
days of innocence
Let's search for
those days gone by
I am there with you
I am there with you
We were young and carefree
Our childhood games
seemed so real
There was no difference
between us
And we smiled and cried together
Let us draw pictures once again
Those pictures we drew as children"
I will run and you catch me
I will put up a swing just for you
I am there for you
I am there for you
I am there for you
I am there for you
Cry... let it out.
You've finally done it.
See these cards and tell
me which one you like.
What are you doing, Papa?
Showing him samples of
your wedding invitation.
- Why?
- He couldn't select you...
let him select the card at least.
This isn't the time
or place for this, Uncle.
This is the time!
This is the time!
Did they see the time,
when they humiliated me?
In front of everyone,
they were screaming
from across the road
and insulting me.
Was it the right place,
to humiliate me like that?
- Come on!
- Kedarnath,
you've just got one sister married.
You have three more to go.
What should I do with her?
Should she remain unmarried?
I've found a groom for her.
I've saved enough for her dowry.
Nothing can stop me now.
But you'd given us five months.
Yes, I had.
Now I take it back!
What can you do?
What can you do about it?
- God is witness to this, Uncle.
- Really?
You're breaking your promise.
Look at Lala,
he's working tirelessly
so that he can keep his promise.
And you're being so unreasonable.
What promise are
you talking about?
Just like he adopted
an orphan like you
so did their mother...
adopt him.
- He acts like he's their real brother.
- Please...
You say he promised
his dying mother...
but she wasn't his mother.
And that man whose photo
is displayed in the shop...
was not his father.
He was a homeless child,
picked up from the streets
and brought home,
to do housework.
Now he thinks he's
the son of the family.
He's just a servant who'd
been taken in.
And now he thinks he's
the heir of the family.
Hey!
Harishankar!
Keep quiet!
How dare you!
I called up the Municipal Corporation...
they've still not picked up the body!
Let us cremate her.
Please don't cry.
Please stop.
I'll set fire to Chandni Chowk
if you take Harishankar's
words to heart.
We take a year to
learn how to talk...
but it takes a lifetime
to know what to say.
Why are you feeling sad about
what Harishankar said?
He doesn't know
how much we love you.
Brother, friend, father...
you're all of these for us, Brother.
Don't cry.
I was a beggar on the streets...
You might have forgotten about it
but how did I not remember that?
How could I forget it?
Brother, sons abandon
their own parents
but you...have always
honored our parents.
Stop crying, please.
Okay, I say shut up now.
This is the first
wedding in the family...
no one should cry.
Let's come up with a plan
on how to deal with Harishankar.
Else he'll get Sapna married
off to someone else.
Go, talk to Ms. Shaanu
and find grooms for them.
Wipe your nose.
I'll figure something.
I can't get my sisters married
to boys who stammer.
I know I'm desperate,
I don't have money
and I'm in a hurry...
My sisters may not be perfect but
I can't get them married
to these boys.
They're a rich family.
They own a ghee dealership.
They also own a lot of land.
But these boys have
a stammering problem!
How would it feel,
if the husband takes
ages to call his wife?
What is your problem?
Your sisters won't give them
a chance to speak anyway.
Think it over...
They're twin boys,
and the family wants them
to marry sisters so that,
the family stays together.
You have everything to gain here.
You'll get Durga and Laxmi
married off together.
Two weddings at the cost of one.
And what about my
promise to my mother?
She'll slap me when
I meet her in heaven.
Decide what you want to do.
This deal is valid only for today.
It won't be long before these
boys find girls to marry.
- Get them married to other girls.
- Think about it.
I won't get my sisters
married to these boys!
- Sure?
- Sure.
- Get them married elsewhere.
- Think about it...
There's nothing to think about.
I refuse...
I flatly refused.
I may be in a hurry
but I won't get them married
to random boys.
- You did the right thing, Brother.
- Bye.
We won't get them married
to these boys.
- Are you okay, Brother?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- How are you?
- I'm absolutely fine, Brother.
- Sure?
- Yes.
- My girl...
- Brother...
I'll call you back.
...everything is decided.
- The priest will tell us.
- Hurry up.
...what to do.
Sapna...
Swapnil, come.
Come here.
How did you like Chandni Chowk?
Very nice.
Good.
Panditji, you were saying...
Their horoscopes match.
That's good news.
Great.
Sapna and Swapnil,
their names sound good together.
Like Jack and Jill...
And who are you?
I... am her friend.
Panditji, please find us the
earliest possible auspicious date.
How about the first
Friday of next month?
Perfect.
No way.
It's not a favorable date...
next month is inauspicious
in the Hindu calendar.
They shouldn't get
married next month.
How do you know so much
about astrology, madam?
Because I embody
the divine feminine!
There's no auspicious date
for the next four months.
I am the divine feminine.
- Mumtaz, listen to me...
- But...
Come into the kitchen,
I want to talk to you.
- No, I don't want to.
- Sapna...
Let go of my hand.
What are you doing?
Listen to me, Mr. Harishankar...
Have you lost your mind?
You can't just walk into someone's
house dressed like this?
I beg you, please give me some time.
I've given you ten years already.
Sir, Panditji is saying--
Don't you see she can't show
her face to strangers?
- Please leave.
- Listen...
Lala, I request you not to do this.
I'll go and fix the earliest
date possible.
You have 25 seconds
to talk to each other.
Let her get on with her life,
you rascal.
Talk some sense into your father.
I will pray to god,
to make you Sapna, and me
Lala Kedarnath in our next life.
You should also wait...
you should know what it feels like
to have prayers go unanswered...
you should know how it feels
to beg and plead with the gods...
How do you sleep
peacefully, Lala?
Father told the girl to take the
boy around Chandni Chowk...
she agreed to it with a smile.
If her lover asks her to wait...
she'll agree to it with a smile.
A girl is not a person.
She's like chewing gum...
pulled by her father
and lover in opposite directions.
I must've eloped with your
wife in our past life,
that's why you're hurting me.
I don't want to
hurt your feelings...
The second Monday of next month
is a very auspicious
day, Mr. Shukla.
Give him a few more
months, Papa.
You'll give me away anyway
wait a few more
months before you do.
Uncle...
Sapna is not under
any kind of pressure, right?
Stop talking like a feminist.
I'm dealing with so much already...
eat samosas.
We should be ashamed
of ourselves, Gayatri...
people who stammer
are human after all...
they're god's children too.
- It--
- Yes, it's very hot today...
- It--
- It will be winter soon.
Another month...
and it'll be winter.
Go--
Gautam Buddha was a holy man.
He was knowledgeable, a good man.
- So--
- Subhash Chowk is very crowded, yes.
Which road did you take?
- We took the road around it.
- Oh, I see.
- Brother...
- Yes?
Let them speak.
Why do you keep interrupting?
She's saying, 'let them speak...'
they're the ones
doing all the talking!
They're the ones asking questions.
- Your--
- Here, eat this.
You should eat one too.
Eat it.
They should get a chance
to speak in private.
Isn't it?
In private? Why?
Then can talk here,
with everyone present...
Brother, we want to!
Give me a minute.
Let me talk to her in private.
Why didn't you find a boy, then?
I've got these two, you have
to talk in front of me.
-- Please come...
- No.
- Hey!
- Let's go.
This is wrong.
- Hey!
- Keep quiet.
What do they need to
discuss that's so private?
You get great food in Old Delhi.
But...
Everything is so delicious.
Have this as well...
- No.
- Eat it all!
So you're working
in your father's company.
This way, madam...
Don't say a word, boy.
Wait a minute.
Hurry up, you're too slow.
Tell me, is he Bulli or Gulli?
This is Bulli and that is Gulli.
Oh, so he is Bulli.
It would've been a mix up...
Bulli, you go there and
Gulli, you come here.
You should speak to the right girl.
He is Bulli, your dream boy.
Talk to her, Bulli.
Mister, this is Gulli.
And that is Bulli.
Will you please leave?
I'll explain...
We'll figure out who
is Bulli and who is Gulli.
- Fine.
- Listen, Brother...
Let their mother come too...
She will... please leave.
Go!
Fine.
They're young, madam...
what if they get too close?
- What are you doing?
- Forget it.
You stay with your husband and
entertain him, I'll be right back.
Stop eating so much.
Gulli... I have bad news.
Your father has chest pain
after eating 17 samosas.
- And now he's feeling sick.
- But...
Let us talk for
five minutes at least.
- You should take him to a doctor nearby.
- ...tell him something.
...the nurses are very pretty,
he'll like it there.
Come with me.
- What's wrong with you?
- Let go of him.
- What happened?
- Doesn't matter what happened...
Lala...
you can ask him in the car.
Don't waste any time.
Start the car. Hurry up.
Hurry up, madam.
Sit inside. Quick.
Don't wear a sari next
time you come.
- What?
- You should wear jeans.
Sit inside.
Come on.
Get in the car, quick!
Press the chest...
not yours, his!
Let's go!
Move aside.
Gulli, drive...
Hurry up.
Bye, madam.
Let them pass.
Excellent!
Such a lovely family.
The boys are chatterboxes...
I'll speak to the
priest and fix a date.
What's wrong?
There's no pleasing you all.
- Lala!
- What is it?
Focus on work.
The curd is too sour.
Doesn't matter...
we'll figure out something.
Let's go.
Where to?
To Sapna's father.
Move aside, Aunty.
Stop right here.
Sapna...
Sapna!
Sapna Gupta...
You?
Namaste, Papa.
Don't call me papa.
- Fine. Namaste, Uncle.
- Don't call me uncle too!
- Namaste, Mr. Harishankar. I--
- Don't call me Harishankar.
What do I call him then?
Call him by, 'Yo, man'.
Yo, man...
the four months' time
that you'd given me
is what I want to talk to you about.
I'm getting Durga and Laxmi married.
I'll marry them off
in a couple of months.
And dowry?
How will you arrange that?
Found a hidden treasure?
Finding treasure is for losers.
Winners need to have a kidney,
which we do...
two of them!
Wait, listen...
Let me see Sapna at least.
Aww.
Now we'll add spice,
Lemon juice...
Perfect.
Ask Achan to put up lights...
in the courtyard...
in a straight line.
Ask Chandu to get flowers...
...and order sweets from
Punjab Sweets.
Why are you so worried, Lala?
We'll make all the arrangements.
It's Gayatri's first Rakshabandhan
after marriage...
It should be perfect.
Okay but where are you going?
I'm going to Bhopal.
But you said Indore.
I did, Bhopal is close to Indore...
I have a couple of
catering orders there.
I'll return before Rakshabandhan.
Okay, bye.
This fragile relationship
Is a cherished bond since childhood
Are you okay, Mr. Lala?
You're being so affectionate,
it's scary.
At least something scares her.
We'll be bound together forever
By our Rakshabandhan
promise to each other
This way, please.
Where did you get the money
for my wedding, Brother?
- I--
- Don't even try to lie to me.
I mortgaged the shop.
Oh no!
To pay for my wedding?
What will you do
when it's their turn?
I have two kidneys...
I'll sell one.
Come on, let's go.
Here's your advance of 25 lakhs.
You'll get another 25 lakhs
after the surgery.
Can I get a receipt
...saying I'll get the
balance payment
after you take my kidney...
My sisters are getting married.
I need the money for their dowry.
I don't have much time
else I wouldn't have...
We've been trading organs
illegally for generations...
Don't worry about it.
Our hearts are bound together.
Our relationship is a sacred one.
I am not myself without you.
You are not yourself without me.
I am not myself without you.
You are not yourself without me.
Our hearts are bound together.
Our relationship is a sacred one.
Are we doing the right thing
by selling your kidney?
Idiot, this was your idea...
now suddenly you have doubts...
They've given me
the injection already.
I am not myself without you.
You are not yourself without me.
I am not myself without you.
You are not yourself without me.
Hi.
Careful.
Happy Rakshabandhan, girls...
You're so late...
- Happy Rakshabandhan.
- We're here...
What took you so long?
Wow!
This isn't how
Gayatri would do it...
she'd keep the rakhi on this...
- Hello?
- I spoke to her yesterday.
Stop eating this...
- I'll tell Gayatri...
- Here...
Don't eat that.
- Lala?
- Brother...What happened?
Is everything alright?
What happened?
What happened?
Brother?
Lala...
Brother?
Say something.
- Gayatri...
- Brother?
- Sir...
- What is it?
I got a call from someone
saying my sister died.
That's why I'm here.
Come.
Make way.
No, madam.
We cannot let you in
...a brother.
He's saying he's the brother.
Sir, I got a call telling me
that Gayatri is dead.
- Are you from Chandni Chowk?
- Yes, sir.
- Kedarnath?
- Yes.
Come with me.
Move aside.
I called you.
The girl's husband
called us at 8:45 a.m.
It looks like a case of suicide,
prima facie.
Show him the face.
Sir... this isn't my sister...
she was light-skinned...
This girl is blue, sir.
Gayatri...
Gayatri...
Gayatri...
Gayatri...
Gayatri...
Gayatri...
You know my sister
was a cheerful girl.
...please.
She was such a good girl...
was she not good enough?
Did she not love you, sir?
Didn't she cook for you, Aunty?
Did she not look after your house?
Why did you kill her?
Why?
They wanted a refrigerator...
- one with a double-door...
- Stop.
Be quiet.
They made your
sister's life miserable
with their endless demands.
I asked her to tell
you what was going on.
She said, 'My brother has been
through a lot because of me.
He worked tirelessly to
put together my dowry.
How can I ask him for more?'
They told her she couldn't
go for Rakshabandhan
if they didn't get a refrigerator.
That's why she consumed poison.
As you leave...
Bedecked with jewelry and henna.
And the palanquin
decorated with flowers.
You were meant
to belong to another.
Tears in our eyes,
we watch as you leave.
As you leave...
May you be happy always.
My dear sister.
As your family sends you off 
As your family sends you off 
Tears in our eyes.
For our starry-eyed girl
May all your dreams come true
Our blessings are with you
As your family sends you off
As your family sends you off
You're leaving your family behind
And starting a new life
You will bring joy
To someone else's life
You brighten up our lives
And bring us happiness
Your husband will love you
Just as we do
You are wished happiness
As your family sends you off 
Your new family is lucky
To find someone as precious as you
They are glad to have got a girl
Who will bring happiness
to their lives
Congratulations
God bless you with a long life
And happiness
As your family sends you off
As your family sends you off
As your family sends you off
Gaffar...
Open the shop.
- But, Lala, we should--
- Come on, open it.
Open it.
I am a fool!
My father was a fool!
His father was a fool!
They served golgappas to women...
blessed them saying,
'you'll have a son'.
'You'll have a son!'
These very sons grow up and
poison our sisters and daughters.
For what?
What do they kill them for?
For a refrigerator?
For a TV?
They set our daughters
on fire for this!
Why do they kill our girls?
Take this board down.
I refuse to sell golgappas
that ensure a son!
- Take the board down.
- Okay.
Take it down!
Take it down!
I sent them my beautiful sister...
those dogs sent back a corpse!
Those dogs sent back a corpse.
They won't stop, Gaffar.
These boys' families won't stop...
they'll demand more and more...
and we'll keep giving
in to their demands.
They'll keep asking
for more dowry..
This lady was right.
You were right, madam.
The ones demanding dowry will
never do away with this custom.
The ones giving it,
will have to do away with it.
The landlord will
keep asking for more
but the farmer has to refuse
to give in to the demands.
I thought I'd give them what
they were asking for,
to ensure that my sister is happy...
but, no...
they want more.
They want gifts on every festival...
when a child is born...
at various family functions...
When there is a marriage in their family,
we have to send gifts!
We have to keep giving...
even when we can't afford to!
Their demands never end!
They demand more and more.
Just like I had promised
my dying mother...
I promise you, my dear sisters...
I'll make you so capable
that you'll get dowry.
The money that I've
put together for your dowry...
I'll use it for educating you.
I'll make you so capable
that you can demand dowry.
Swear on your father that
you won't back down.
Self-respect is much more
important than marriage.
I understand this now...
after losing my sister.
I sent off a lively girl and...
I've brought back a dead girl.
They killed her.
Sapna...
you've waited for me to fulfill
my promise to my mother.
Now don't wait for me to fulfill
my promise to my sisters...
Don't waste any more time,
get married to
whomever your father
wants you to marry.
Wait.
Listen to me...
God doesn't want us to be together.
Don't fight it.
Don't.
I'll kill myself
if you don't listen to me.
Marry whomever your father
wants you to.
Leave me.
Cry...
Cry as much as you want today.
Cry your heart out.
But no more crying after today.
Wipe your tears.
We have to study very hard.
Brother did all he could for us.
Now it's time we did something.
Grieving your sister,
drinking alcohol,
your exhaustion...
I get all this, Kedara...
But what I don't get is...
why are you punishing me?
Why should I marry someone else?
Why should I?
The person I've waited
for since childhood...
if he can't be mine,
then a stranger surely
won't be, Kedara!
Listen to me.
I'll wait for you,
for as long as it takes...
to fulfill your responsibilities.
I'll wait.
I'll fight with everyone...
with Papa...
I'll listen to all their taunts.
But you're the one I want to marry.
After losing a sister
and a kidney, Sapna...
I've understood...
nothing is more
important than family.
Tell me,
will you be okay
knowing your father died
worrying about your marriage?
Tell me.
You might find love again, Sapna
but you won't find another father.
Don't leave me, Lala.
Don't leave me, please.
This city has many people married
to someone they're not in love with
so what if there are two
more added to the list?
Listen to me.
Go, wear new clothes,
have a meal...
see how happy this
makes your father.
You'll feel better
in a couple of days.
Sapna, the whole of Delhi knows that
Lala Kedarnath makes
the best chaat in town.
I'll treat everyone to chaat
on your wedding.
You'll die if you're separated from me
I'll die if I'm separated from you
Love will grieve...
Love will grieve...
And this is how our story ends
And this is how our story ends
My promise to you
won't break easily
But it might break,
if you're upset with me
No matter what
We will fulfill the
promises we've made
We are both
very much in love
You'll die if you forget
I'll die if I forget
Love will grieve...
Love will grieve...
And this is how our story ends
And this is how our story ends
I promise to be with you always
May we remain just as we are
You can test me any way you like
Our hearts are united
My heart knows the
way to your heart
Way to your heart
You'll die if you change
I'll die if I change
Love will grieve...
Love will grieve...
And this is how our story ends
And this is how our story ends
Sapna, listen to me...
all the rituals we've had till now
don't really mean anything.
This is the real thing...
the pheras (circling the holy fire)
that you're about to do.
Once you complete
the pheras, it's final.
Don't go ahead with this.
When I meet your
mother after I die...
If I make you sad,
what do you think she'll say?
How do you think she'll react?
Please.
Don't go ahead with this.
What will the groom's family say?
That's your lookout.
Won't they create a scene?
They will create a scene for sure.
Go ahead.
[chanting prayers]
Won't you handle it?
You have an affair
and I'm supposed to 'handle it'?
Look at Lala.
The rascal is staring at you.
Come on, Sapna.
Do something.
Only two pheras are left
out of the seven.
Do something!
Hey, Lala...
only two pheras
are left to be taken.
Come and stop me, you fool.
Sapna! What nonsense is this?
Hey! I just saw him wink.
They're up to something.
You asked if Sapna was
under any pressure...
now you have a problem with it?
Don't touch me.
- What is he talking about?
- This is not done!
Aren't you ashamed?
That old man is willing to get
beaten up for this and you...
just stand and keep staring at me
instead of doing anything.
What can I do?
Aww, 'what can I do'?
'I've done the catering'.
I feel like hitting you, Lala.
You'd said...
'there's nothing more
important than family'...
So who am I?
Am I not your family?
From tomorrow you and your father
can start pestering me
for marriage again...
Lala, you think I'll wait for you
and not even pester you?
Sure you can.
I'll go to your shop everyday
and ask you...
'when are we getting married, Lala?'
It's done.
It's settled.
The family has agreed,
so has the boy.
They're good people.
He has a request, Lala...
- Tell him, son.
- You tell him.
- I'm feeling shy.
- Feeling shy?
A little.
Lala, he fancies Laxmi.
- Really?
- Didi?
He's been staring
at her all this while.
No, I was just...
There's no pressure...
only if everyone's okay with it.
It took a lot of convincing, Lala.
- Agree to it.
- Fine.
Come to Daryaganj
after my coaching class.
- But I'll agree only if like you.
- Sure.
Okay. 5 p.m.
Hope you know, we don't give dowry,
we take dowry.
Everyone here knows this.
Our family's story was
now complete but
it would take a few
more years to end.
Lala, you rascal,
when will you get married?
- I knew it.
- Lala...
I knew it.
My brother had fulfilled his duty.
But he was yet to fulfill
his promise...
he could marry only after
my three sisters did.
He worked day and night for this.
200 years ago we cremated women
on their husband's funeral pyres.
But now we don't even
wait for that anymore...
the husband sets his wife
on fire and kills her.
But it's soon
forgotten and forgiven...
After losing me, my brother
and everyone realized...
a girl also has 206 bones...
her blood is also red in color
when her flesh burns, it smells
the same as that of a man's flesh
and that if she's encouraged,
she too can be successful in life.
12 years ago, my brother had
cremated me and said...
nothing is more important
than self-respect.
Being independent is the first
step towards gaining that.
The day every girl in this country
is able to support herself,
that day people will stop
demanding dowry.
A marriage is an equal
partnership, my friend.
Neither spouse deserves more
or less importance.
Neither spouse should give
or take money to get married.
When will we understand this?
How many girls have to get beaten,
threatened and even killed?
Superb!
My brother looks so handsome,
even at 60.
May God bless him with a long life.
I wanted to dance at
my brother's wedding
I wanted to live
life to the fullest
I wanted to shine as bright as
fireworks at my brother's wedding.
But it wasn't to be.
I want to bless everyone
with a brother like mine.
My only wish is...
a girl is killed every hour
in this country for dowry...
this should stop.
If only so that she too can see
her brother getting married
...bringing her sister-in-law home.
In India, 20 girls are killed for dowry, every day.
