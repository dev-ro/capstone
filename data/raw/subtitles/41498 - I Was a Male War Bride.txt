[ Yells ]
I've killed a Hydra before.
Of course, then I had
Hercules with me.
[ Screams ]
[ Yawns ]
Same nightmare?
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
That makes it the Hydra, three,
Iolaus, nothing.
[ Exhales ]
Maybe...
you need to slow down,
get away for a while.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
You're tellingme
to take a vacation?
Why not? Everyone needs
a break now and then.
Well, yeah, but usually
it's me telling you to--
Oh, hey, hey, Herc,
I know the perfect spot.
We are gonna be treated
like royalty.
We? Nobody said "we."
Come on. It stands to reason.
If I need a break,
you need a break.
[ Laughs ]
We are gonna wallow in luxury.
[ Exhales ]
[ Woman ]
No, no, no, no, no!
You can't use me like
you were trading a horse
or a cow or something.
My dear, your marriage to
Prince Gordius will ensure
peace between our kingdoms.
Oh, peace, war, who cares?
This is my life
we're talking about!
Oh, Daddy.
Ever since
I was a little girl,
I've dreamed about
the kind of man I'd marry.
Oh, he'd be handsome
and charming...
and all the other
princesses would want him,
and he'd just want me,
and they'd be so jealous!
And now you wanna
spoil all that!
[ Crying ]
What's going on?
Melissa can be heard
halfway to Thrace!
Oh, Alexa, thank the gods
you're here!
Father's still trying
to marry me off to that...
Lathian!
My girls. My two
beautiful daughters.
I won't be with you
much longer.
And before I die,
I want our kingdom secured.
And that means naming
the man to marry Melissa
and to take my throne.
Ohh!
Why not let Melissa rule?
She's the rightful heir.
Melissa rule my kingdom?
This is a big job, Alexa.
Making laws,
commanding the army.
I'm sorry, but...
like it or not, girls,
this is a man's world.
-A woman can be strong as a man.
-We're talking about
 your sister.
Daddy, if I have to marry
someone, why does it have
to be a Lathian?
You once considered them
our worst enemy.
Once you're married,
our two kingdoms
will be united.
Now, that means no more war.
We can destroy our weapons.
Oh, but I don't love him!
You don't even know him!
You were born into
royalty, Melissa.
That means privilege
and sacrifice.
You leave for Lathia
in the morning.
My life is over.
Maybe there's
a way out.
Alexa, it's nice to dream,
but come tomorrow morning,
I'm going to be sacrificed
on the altar of marriage...
to his royal fatness,
Prince Gordius.
Unless I'm not here.
What do you mean?
Run away?
Oh, who am I kidding?
Where would I go?
Who would dress me?
 Who would feed me?
Who would do my hair?
Oh, it's a jungle
out there.
Oh, I'm going to bed.
If I'm lucky,
I'll die in my sleep.
[ Snoring ]
Don't wanna get married,
Princess?
Well, this is your lucky day.
[ Laughing ]
[ Man Narrating ]
This is the story
of a time long ago,
a time of myth and legend,
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.
Only one man dared
to challenge their power--
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,
the all-powerful
queen of the gods.
But wherever
there was evil,
wherever an innocent
would suffer,
there would be... Hercules.
- [ Screeching ]
- [ Roaring ]
Hail!
I thought you said
we would wallow in luxury.
I did.
So, this must be
wallowing.
Hmm. Now I know
what a pig feels like.
Me too.
It's very good for your skin,
you know. This is nice,
don't you think?
I'm Marjus from
Century One Realty.
Can we talk?
Uh, actually,
we're on vacation.
Oh, what's a vacation for
anyway? Am I right?
All work and no play?
I don't think so.
I'm giving
you nice boys two words.
Are you ready for this?
Are you listening?
Two words.
Timeshare.
Huh, huh?
Timeshare.
Yeah. I love to help people.
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.
Don't thank me now.
Wait till you hear the details.
Then you'll say,
"Marj, who knew? Who knew?
 I can't thank you enough."
That's what you'll say.
But I'll tell you,
"No need, no need."
And you know why?
Because I love
to help people.
[ Laughs ]
Boys? Boys!
Father, you called for me.
This was found
outside our gates.
It's from the Lathians.
They have Melissa.
They demand
our immediate surrender
or they kill her.
But Prince Gordius himself
proposed the marriage.
Well, they always were
a treacherous lot.
But why take Melissa?
To force your hand.
You agreed to the marriage.
That means
you're anxious for peace.
It says you're vulnerable.
They think you'll surrender
to save her.
You can't ignore their threats.
You have to send the army
to rescue her.
No, no, that would be
the worst thing to do.
They'd kill her on
the first sight of our army.
We send a spy to Lathia.
If Gordius
has kidnapped Melissa,
we'll know soon enough.
[ Snoring ]
Princess,
time to wake up.
Just a little
bit longer.
[ Yelps ]
Was that absolutely
necessary?
I'm so sorry.
What can I do
to make it up to you?
Well--
Something to eat would be nice.
Oh, nothing fancy.
Poached eggs, bacon.
And one other thing:
You could let me in
on the little joke.
From me to you,
it's not very funny!
It's those Lathians,
isn't it?
This is one of those stupid,
primitive wedding things.
Kidnap the bride,
humiliate her,
make it impossible for her
to get a decent night's sleep!
You wait till I get you
to market, Princess.
You won't get a decent
night's sleep again.
Market? Excuse me.
Uh, what does he mean,
"get me to market"?
Are we going shopping?
Prince Gordius,
how are we today?
Same as every day-- fat.
[ Laughs ]
You're being
too hard on yourself.
You're big-boned
and actually very handsome.
Yeah, well, if I'm
so handsome, why isn't
Princess Melissa here?
I'll tell you why.
She doesn't wanna be here.
She doesn't wanna have
anything to do with me.
Oh, you know how women are.
She probably can't decide
on what to wear.
Right.
Or maybe something
happened to her.
I mean, the roads aren't
safe anymore, you know?
I'm telling you, Acteon,
I don't like it.
It means trouble.
Enough worrying.
It's time to celebrate.
A toast to the unification
of Lathia and Alcinia.
No.
I can't relax
until Princess Melissa
arrives safe and sound.
[ Iolaus ] Wasn't that great?
Hey, is your skin
all warm and tingly?
Ah, yeah. Why don't we
head up the coast
and do a little fishing?
Fishing would be good.
[ Man Shouts ]
Move, you worthless vermin!
Hold on. What's this?
[ Whip Cracks ]
[ Melissa ] Careful with that!
You could put an eye out
with that thing.
Oh, another word,
and you'll all
get a taste of it.
Will you shut up?
[ Scoffs ]
Me? I'm not the one
cracking my whip,
making threats
like a big shot.
Besides, I'm a princess.
I don't have
to put up with this.
[ Slave Trader ]
Come on! Let's go!
Excuse me, are we
about through with
this little joke?
You know, the part where
everybody jumps out
and yells, "Surprise"?
Oh, am I gonna enjoy this.
Nice whip.
Mind if I give it a spin?
Hercules.
Melissa?
Get him!
Uh, Herc, these guys are--
I got 'em.
Great. I'll get the women.
Here we go.
Hurry.
Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you!
My fresh vegetables!
Hercules!
[ Loud Kisses ]
Melissa,
what happened to you?
Oh, I know I'm a mess.
You wouldn't believe
the day I've had.
No. How did you end up in
the hands of a slave trader?
Oh, well, he kidnapped me
right out of the palace.
I thought it was all a joke.
No, that wasn't a joke.
Those guys were serious.
Something's very odd here.
There's more to this.
There is?
And you would be?
Oh. Iolaus, this is
Princess Melissa of Alcinia.
I helped her father
negotiate a peace treaty,
what, seven, eight years ago?
Melissa, Iolaus.
Hi.
Pretty scrawny for
a manservant, isn't he?
Uh, Iolaus is
my best friend.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, Hercules.
Still taking in every
stray dog that comes along.
Excuse me?
Iolaus and I will
take you home now...
and try to get
to the bottom of this.
We will?
Wonderful! You can get
the carriage now, "Iolfus."
The name is Iolaus,
and we don't have a carriage.
Uh, no. Sorry.
Think you can
manage on foot?
You mean walk?
How quaint.
I've always wanted
to commune with nature.
Yeah. Let's rough it.
Stray dog?
I'll explain later.
Of course, if we're on foot,
I'll need a walking stick.
-Oh, that'll do nicely.
- No, that's not a good idea.
Oh, Iolfus!
You should be more careful!
[ Man ]
My beautiful vegetables!
[ Sighs ]
This is gonna be
a very long trip.
Iolfus! Are you unaware
of the custom?
Commoners
walk behind royalty.
Three paces behind.
So, your father thought
he could solidify the peace
with Lathia...
by marrying you
to Prince Gordius?
Well, that was his plan
until I got kidnapped,
of course.
Who'd wanna kidnap you?
I can't imagine,
though I wouldn't
put it past old Gordo.
No. Gordius is
a man of his word.
It's someone else.
Someone with a reason.
Well, whoever it was,
I'd like to thank him.
It put a stop to this whole
wedding thing.
Why don't you wanna
marry Prince Gordius?
Well, from what I hear,
he's not exactly
husband material.
You mean you haven't
even met him?
I don't have to meet someone
to know they're unappealing.
I hear he's so fat,
he has to bathe
in the castle moat.
Can you imagine me
marrying someone like that?
No. He might be
a nice guy.
Excuse me, is there a problem?
Well, now that
you mention it--
Hey, hey, hey!
Enough, all right?
I mean, we still have
a long way to go,
and we should just try
to get along, all right?
All right. Uh--
I am sorry.
Hmph!
Well, he started it.
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Oh, Father!
I'm just as worried as you are
about Melissa, my dear.
It's more than that.
Oh?
I was thinking
about you.
The way you looked
leading our army
into battle.
So proud, strong.
You were unstoppable.
Those were good days,
Father.
No, no.
I was a foolish man.
I built the world's
most awesome weapon--
the Fist of Tolas--
and I used it without mercy.
I'm thankful that the kingdom
survived those times.
But for you, Alexa,
I pray the good days
are yet to come.
[ Coughing ]
It's time I put you
to bed, Father.
I-- I suppose you're right.
[ Coughing ]
[ Melissa ]
Is that a bug?
Look at the size of that thing!
What are we doing
in a swamp anyway?
I've never seen so many
creepy-crawly creatures
in all my life.
You wanted
to commune with nature.
Well, that was before.
I didn't know that nature
was so... natural.
[ Yelps ]
Quicksand!
I'm sinking here!
You're fine.
It's just a little mud.
This is horrid!
Can't we at least find
some pretty scenery
to look at?
We don't have time
for that.
Your father will be worried,
and so will Prince Gordius.
One of them could do
something foolish.
Like what?
Like start a war?
A war? Fought over me?
Oh, how romantic!
You can't be serious.
Why not?
Paris and Menelaus fought
over Helen of Troy.
And thousands of innocent lives
were lost for no good reason.
Oh. Oh, why doesn't anything
exciting like that
ever happen to me?
Unbelievable.
You are the most
self-centered,
inconsiderate,
thoughtless woman
I've ever met!
Are you gonna let him
speak to me like that?
Herc, are you gonna
straighten her out,
or am I?
- [ Sighs ]
  He's got a point.
-Right!
But now's not the time,
nor the place to make it.
Let's keep moving.
I'll have you know
I'm a very considerate
person.
I never go to a castle
empty-handed!
I always say nice things
to visiting dignitaries,
no matter how stupid
or ugly they are!
I'm nice to animals!
Well, most animals.
There was that thing
with Alexa's cat,
but that wasn't my fault!
[ Coughing ]
Oh, Father, I didn't want it
to come to this.
Everything
our kingdom stands for
is about to be destroyed,
and yet you can do nothing.
I know what you want, Father,
and I know it's up to me
to make it happen.
[ Muffled Grunting ]
Lieutenant!
You called,
Princess Alexa?
The king is dead.
In my sister's absence,
I have no choice...
but to claim the throne
as Queen of Alcinia.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Of course, Your Majesty.
Notify my ministers.
The Lathians have brought
this dark day upon us.
I am declaring war.
It was the king's
dying wish.
Prepare the Fist of Tolas,
my father's ultimate weapon.
It will be the instrument
of our revenge.
Well, what do we do now?
We wade across.
Well, is it safe?
Yeah, yeah.
Herc, you know,
you really should go first,
just to make sure
it's, uh, safe.
Fine.
See? It's not that deep.
There's a hole right here,
so you better watch out
for that.
Come on. It's okay.
Slow down!
This isn't a race!
I knew I should never have
listened to you!
There must be a bridge
around here somewhere.
Would you just keep still!
Whoa!
[ Screams ]
Oh!
[ Sighs ]
Lady, I have two words
to say to you:
Get off my back!
[ Screaming ]
Melissa, you ought to be
more careful.
[ Yelling ]
[ Whimpering ]
[ Alexa ] Halt!
[ Lieutenant ]
Hold it right there, men.
I want a fully armed
exercise for the crew
handling the weapon.
Use the village ahead
for a target.
Those are civilians,
Queen Alexa.
We're going to kill
every Lathian we see,
civilian or soldier.
We'll terrorize
the heartland.
It'll be a short war.
Prepare the weapon!
Get that arm!
Give me a hand here!
Lock and load!
My father was a great warrior...
before Hercules forced him
into a treaty with the Lathians.
Peace between us
will never be possible.
We do now what my father
should have done then.
Oh, and, Lieutenant,
never question
my command again.
Prepare to fire.
You sent for me?
Your Majesty,
what are you doing?
I'm taking some men
to search for Princess Melissa.
[ Scoffs ]
Is that such a good idea?
I mean, it could be
dangerous.
We don't know
what the Alcinians
might be up to.
We don't actually know
that they're up to anything.
Do we?
No. No, we don't.
But if they were,
it could be... dangerous.
You worry for nothing.
I trust King Tolas. Let's go.
I-- I've never seen
anything like this.
I have.
This is from a weapon
I'd hoped to never see again.
You got your wish.
Looks like a war
has started.
Lathians, kill them!
Hercules, what is this?
It's a whole lot of guys
shooting at us!
There's cover over there.
Come on!
- [ Screaming ]
- Melissa!
Hercules!
Right here. Iolaus!
This is ridiculous!
Don't they know who I am?
They don't care who you are!
That's what war is.
Kill people
and tear stuff up.
I've got to stop this.
Please don't leave me.
[ Man ]
It's the Lathian army!
Hey.
They've stopped.
[ Man Groaning ]
Listen.
Stay here.
All right, come on.
It's okay, it's okay.
We're here to help.
Iolaus.
Melissa, come here.
Give me your hand.
What are you doing?
Apply pressure there.
Oh, but he's Lathian.
Just do it.
[ Whines ]
I'm getting blood on me.
[ Iolaus ]
Be thankful it isn't yours.
Iolaus, there's a temple.
It's not far.
It's neutral ground.
We'll take them there.
No. We can't
take them with us.
They'll slow us down.
If we leave them here,
these men will die!
But we'll all die
if we take them.
Melissa,
we are helping these men.
You're going to be
all right.
By the gods,
what's happening out there?
Ignorance and stupidity.
You're welcome here.
There's not much I can do.
I'm not a healer.
It's all right.
You can help us.
[ Groans ]
There you go.
Look at this.
Iolaus, you and Melissa
take the other side.
Start with the ones
who are hurt the worst.
A lot of help
she's gonna be.
Give her a chance.
Give me a choice.
You've seen
a lot of these?
Too many to count.
The weapon worked better
than I ever expected.
Lathia is mine.
Your Highness, our spies
found your sister.
She's in a temple
not far off the main road.
But... that's not possible.
Is she alone?
She's with Hercules.
Shall I tell the troops
to stand down?
No. We march ahead
as planned.
It was Hercules who forced
my father into a treaty
with the Lathians.
His death will be
a part of my victory.
We will march on this temple,
killing everything in our path,
including Hercules.
Is that understood?
But what about
Princess Melissa?
If my sister dies,
such is the price of war.
Now ready the weapon.
You brought me here
to teach me a lesson,
didn't you?
The ravages of war,
 the beauty of peace,
and now I'm supposed to run home
and marry Gordius
like everyone wants.
You can marry
whoever you want to.
No matter what happens,
one day you will be a queen.
And being here now may
make you a better one then.
How? By making me feel
stupid and helpless?
No, Melissa.
Look around you.
This is what war
does to people.
So when it's your turn
to choose between making war
or keeping the peace,
- you'll know what's at stake.
- I don't want that kind of
  responsibility, Hercules.
I don't know the first thing
about taking care of a kingdom.
It starts...
one person at a time.
[ Men Groaning ]
What can I do...
to help?
[ Moans ]
I don't think war looks
so romantic to her anymore.
Hm.
Think you can
handle the rest?
Where you going?
To find the weapon
that did this.
I could use a hand here!
Hercules. Now,
what are you doing here?
Trying to prevent friends
from going to war.
I'm afraid
you're too late.
Maybe not.
I have Princess Melissa.
You do?
What happened? Where is she?
She's safe...
in a temple near here.
When she didn't
show up for the wedding,
I knew it meant trouble,
but I never dreamed Tolas
would use one of the weapons
he vowed to destroy.
It's not Tolas.
I'm sure of that.
Who else could it be?
Hercules, this is
my prime minister, Acteon.
Hercules,
we value your help.
I'm not here to take sides.
Why don't you grab your men?
I'll show you the way
to the temple.
You're late.
Is Gordius dead?
No.
He's with
your sister.
Gordius, Melissa
and Hercules together?
So they die together.
Alexa! What do you think
you're doing?
Have you come to meddle
in my kingdom's business
yet again?
Your kingdom?
What would King Tolas
have to say about that?
The king is dead!
Long live the queen!
Although I can't say
the same for my sister.
Prepare to fire!
Why are you doing this?
It doesn't make any sense.
You know I'll stop you!
I don't think so.
This is something not even
you can stop, Hercules.
Fire!
Yes!
Sergeant.
Leave some men here.
Dig him out.
If the rocks didn't kill him,
finish the job.
Let's go!
He's dead.
Move the rest of the rocks.
Your Highness,
the weapon is
slowing us down.
We'll take the main column
ahead to the temple.
Put more men on the weapon
and tell them to move quickly.
Here.
Ah, thank you.
Man over there
needs a fresh bandage.
Melissa, over here.
[ Exhales ]
She's very sweet.
Yeah. She's
a regular princess.
So, you're, uh,
Princess Melissa
of Alcinia.
Yeah.
Here.
Oh.
You're not quite
what I expected.
Yeah, well,
I guess I'm not quite
what I expected either.
Who are you?
Prince Gordius.
Oh, uh, so what
did you expect?
Um, I don't know.
Uh, makeup,
too much perfume, big hair.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, well, I guess
I'm not that kind of princess.
I hope not.
You're not disappointed?
No, I'm not.
That hand of yours
could use a bandage.
You took long enough.
No time to spare.
Well, well, well.
A honeymoon and a funeral
on the same day.
How convenient.
Wait. There are only
wounded in here.
- That's not what I heard.
- Alexa, what are you doing?
Melissa,
our father is dead.
He was killed by
Prince Gordius,
part of the plot
he and my sister
cooked up...
to seize the throne
of Alcinia.
That's a lie!
[ Melissa Sobs ]
Save your tears.
You'll be with Father soon.
[ Gordius ] You'll never
get away with this.
I already have.
Destroy this place
and everyone in it!
- These men have no weapons!
  They're all wounded!
- Who are you?
That's Iolfus,
a friend of Hercules.
Actually, it's Iolaus.
Hercules won't be
fighting anyone.
- Why? What have you done?
- Let's just say
  I've got him covered.
Acteon.
- Have you betrayed me?
- I saw it as
  a good career move.
Enough! Attack!
[ Soldiers Yelling ]
Get out of here!
Please, Alexa, how can you?
Father would never believe--
Our father should have
been here by my side now,
but he was weak and dying.
I had to help him along.
You killed him.
I think of it more
as putting him
out of his misery.
You were supposed to be
long gone too.
I told the slave trader
to find you something
nice, comfortable--
a harem maybe
or a bordello.
Good-bye, sister.
Hold it!
Sorry I'm late.
Things kind of...
piled up on me.
Alexa, you're not big
on family, are you?
Get him!
Don't even
think about it.
Ohh.
Thank you.
Keep 'em busy.
Me? Where you going?
For the weapon.
- Iolaus, I'm going
  for the weapon!
- You betcha!
Your Majesty.
I hope you understand.
It was nothing personal.
Understand this,
Mr. Prime Minister.
[ Grunts ]
Oh. You all right?
Good.
Hercules has attacked our men.
I'll get the weapon.
You mount a counterattack.
[ Lieutenant ]
Yes, my queen.
There he is.
Get him!
[ All Yelling ]
[ Metal Clanking ]
Now you die, Hercules.
Going somewhere,
little sister?
I didn't make things
very easy for you.
I'm sorry.
Gordius and I would like
to thank you both
for everything.
I just wish my father
were here to share
in our happiness.
I have a feeling
King Tolas is watching you
from the Elysian Fields,
and he is very proud.
So, what's next?
Unification of
the two kingdoms?
We thought we should get
to know each other first.
But things are
progressing very nicely.
Thanks again, Hercules.
Iolaus.
Bye.
See ya.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, Herc.
Hm.
She remembered my name.
Oh, she did,
didn't she?
Ha!
I was just starting to
get used to "Doofus."
Hey, that's "Iolfus."
Ah, whatever.
Now, this vacation.
You know what we should do?
We should try that new thing...
where you tie a rope
around your ankles
and dive off a cliff.
That'd be great!
Are you sure your name
isn't Doofus?
[ Both Laughing ]
