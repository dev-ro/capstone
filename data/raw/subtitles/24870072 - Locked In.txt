E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U-L-O-M...
M?
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U...
M-U
E-S-A-R...
Murder.
Someone tried to murder you?
Who tried to murder you?
Mrs. Carter?
Mrs. Carter?
Can you open your right eye
for me, Katherine?
{\an8}Mrs. Carter?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
{\an8}You've sustained serious head trauma.
You've been in a coma for three days.
{\an8}Your brain stem has been damaged.
{\an8}Brain imaging and EEG are normal,
{\an8}but I... need some indication
that you can understand me.
{\an8}Are you able to blink?
{\an8}Blink.
{\an8}Nothing.
{\an8}I want you to follow my finger
with your eyes.
{\an8}Right eye worries me.
{\an8}Left eye appears incapable
of voluntary movement.
Is she even aware?
Mrs. Carter,
I'm just gonna sit you up.
My name's Nicky Mackenzie.
I work for the hospital,
but don't let that worry you.
I haven't killed anyone yet.
I'm just gonna move your head.
Right. I know that there's damage
to your right eye,
but can you try
and move your left eye for me?
I won't give up if you don't.
Not until you can blink or move your eye
from the left to the right.
I'm going to continue
to assume that there's someone in there.
Well, I'm out of a job
if there isn't.
I know.
I'm waiting. I'll let you know.
Lina Carter.
You don't remember me, do you?
Come on.
They said something about, um...
locked-in syndrome.
Right.
It means
a loss of limb function and speech
in what they call
"cognitively intact individuals."
So usually,
if she was conscious,
she'd be able to communicate
with, um, a blink
or a movement of her eye,
but in her case,
the good eye is immovable.
So...
Well...
It means
she's either in and out of consciousness,
or she can't control her eye,
or...
she's in a vegetative state.
We just don't know yet.
Will she recover?
If she's in there...
I'll find her.
I'm a neuroclinical nurse. It's what I do.
Tell me about her.
I've known Katherine all my life.
And when Mom died,
she became my legal guardian.
And Rowling Manor became my home.
Back then, Katherine was rich,
glamorous and famous.
I loved everything about her.
And I would've done anything for her.
I suppose all I ever wanted was
for her to love me.
But everything
had been turned upside down.
When Katherine's husband died,
he cut her out of his will
and left everything to his son Jamie.
And it poisoned their relationship.
I'd just lost my mom,
and I needed a family.
If they couldn't be there for
each other, I'd be there for both of them.
I couldn't save my mom,
so I was damn well
gonna try and save them.
Hold on.
Jamie!
Katherine, help!
- Aren't we supposed to grab his tongue?
- Not unless you wanna lose a finger.
- What if he chokes?
- Turn him on his side.
Put it under his head. Here.
Should we call Dr. Lawrence?
- What do we do?
- We keep an eye on him.
If it lasts more than five minutes,
we'll call an ambulance.
He's not breathing.
He'll start again in a minute.
Check his airway isn't blocked.
Emergency services.
Which service do you require?
He's breathing.
False alarm.
Are you all right?
First night out in two years.
You look so beautiful.
Where are you going?
I'm meeting a director.
My mobile number's on the fridge.
Call me if you need me,
but, uh, don't call.
We'll be fine.
Jamie's feeling better today,
and he's never seen your show.
I'm gonna make him watch season one.
He milks them, my stepson, the seizures.
Then he brings them on
to punish me the moment I try
to live any sort of life for myself.
Maybe he just misses his dad.
It's hard when someone you love dies.
I should know.
You're a good girl, Lina.
Your mom was lucky to have you.
- How do I look?
- Amazing.
- Ready for my big comeback?
- Definitely.
Ugh. Mutton dressed as lamb.
Mommy?
What's wrong?
I'm scared.
Oh. You're a very brave girl,
and we're gonna
get through this together, okay?
I heard what happened.
To your mom.
You're safe here.
With me.
You'll protect me, will you?
Promise?
I promise.
What was she like?
My mom?
She was brilliant.
She played the piano.
Well, sort of.
She taught me the basics, anyway.
I can teach you if you like.
I don't remember my real mom.
I remember my dad.
Sometimes his face
gets a bit fuzzy though.
Like I'm starting to forget him too.
Katherine got rid of the photos.
Most of them, anyway.
It's hard.
Losing someone.
Anyway, we've got each other now.
Katherine.
You know, it takes an act of faith
to say to yourself,
"She's still the same underneath."
The police say that, um,
she was knocked down by a driver.
Is that right? A hit-and-run?
They're not sure.
Right.
Hmm. Will you help me out with something?
I... I just can't wrap me head around it.
Um,
Katherine's your adopted mother,
but she's also your mother-in-law.
It's complicated.
Oh. Well, I like complicated.
I couldn't abandon him.
By the time we were married,
Jamie depended on me
for absolutely everything.
He needed me.
And to be honest, I needed him too.
I'd looked after him for so long,
he'd become my whole life.
She's had too many.
I was Jamie's reason for living.
And I told myself he was mine.
But Katherine thought
I was a treacherous gold digger.
She thought I was stealing her home.
When all I was trying to do
was make us a family.
Lina.
My beloved daughter-in-law.
Which I did not see coming.
Who'd have thought
that when you turned up here...
...a helpless waif and stray,
completely dependent on my kindness, that...
that you'd end up...
...lady of the bloody manor.
To Jamie and Lina.
To Jamie and Lina.
Look at her.
- Showing off.
- She's not.
She is.
She was nice to you before we got engaged.
Suddenly, starts treating you like shit.
- What does that tell you, hmm?
- Jamie.
This house, that's all she cares about.
Not us. Definitely not me.
Will you stop it?
This is our wedding night.
Exactly. Anyone would think
it's all about her.
Fucking Hollywood has-been
plays lady of the manor.
- I'll spoil her fun.
- Jamie, don't you dare.
Please!
Clear the floor.
- Stand back. Give him some space.
- Somebody help.
- Excuse me.
- I presume she knows.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Seizures aside, Jamie,
we've got to get you off
of these pain meds.
- You're the one who gave them to me.
- With the strict proviso not to drink.
I keep telling him.
It's my wedding day.
Anyway, I pay you to write prescriptions.
You're a village GP.
You're not some Harley Street specialist.
You've got ideas above your station.
She's bad enough.
She watches me like a bloody hawk.
I take them as prescribed.
Mostly.
I'm in pain.
- Neither of you know what it's like.
- We understand, Jamie.
Right. I will come
and see you tomorrow morning.
Yeah, yeah, fine.
I'm so sorry this has happened,
tonight of all nights, Lina.
If there's anything I can do,
anything at all,
please don't hesitate to ask.
Thank you.
I'm just
looking out for you, Lina.
I'm just gonna lie you back.
There we are.
I'm going to do your hands now.
Just gonna go in between your fingers.
- Here.
- Me?
Mm-hmm. Come on.
Well, you're gonna have to
learn how to do it at some point.
Do you wanna get her shoulder?
Go on.
Oh, here. Hands.
There.
Just take that down.
Just careful around the ECG spot.
Up round the neck.
It's an unlucky lot, your lot.
First Jamie, now...
now Katherine.
Jamie.
I used to look after him.
Do you not remember me?
What's Jamie got to do with anything?
I don't know.
You tell me, love.
Jamie was always ill.
First, it was the seizures.
- Then...
- Lina!
Coming!
...lots of things.
- Where are you?
- Your Royal fucking Highness...
- So he never left the house.
- Lina, come on!
And neither did I.
Oh!
- Oh.
- Sorry.
No, my fault.
Oh!
All right.
Uh...
- What's that?
- Nothing.
Here you go.
No rest for the wicked.
You've got to get off these pain meds.
Don't start.
- It's dripping.
- Don't be such a baby.
I'm soaking wet now.
It'll cool the inflammation.
Mm.
Nice?
Yeah.
Yeah, thank you.
We should get married again.
It was
the happiest day of my life.
Passing out?
Dr. Lawrence had
to carry you up the stairs.
Him again.
Don't ever leave me.
Say that you won't.
It's not safe out there, Lina,
beyond these walls.
You of all people know that.
I'm only going for a swim.
It's cold out there.
On the streets.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Good morning.
How's his nibs?
The pills are making him worse.
I've got some steroids we can try.
If they reduce the pain,
then we can wean
him off the Oxy, gradually.
But in the meantime,
I don't want you wearing yourself out,
waiting on him hand and foot.
You're ten years too late.
Yeah.
Win the lottery, did you?
Oh, you mean these?
No, they're just good fakes.
I mean the car.
The car, yes.
What do you reckon?
Nice, huh? Splashed out on a loan.
You off for a swim?
If I can make it
without the bloody bell ringing.
It must be freezing in there.
I jump in
before I can get second thoughts.
Do you?
What's the difference
between a good joke and a bad joke?
I don't know.
Timing.
- That's awful.
- It's absolutely terrible.
But you laughed, and that means
you definitely need to get out more.
Where would I go?
Oh, Lina.
There's a whole world out there.
You can't hide out here forever.
Can't I?
Jamie!
- What's happening?
- Call an ambulance.
Now!
How's our patient today?
- Oh, uh, he seems to be doing much better.
- Hmm?
I'm sorry, you are...?
Yes, uh, Dr. Robert Lawrence.
Oh.
I, um, I don't... don't know
a doctor here with that name.
- Well, I'm his GP.
- Oh!
What are you doing here?
I'm also a close family friend.
Oh, okay.
You're not the one who prescribed him
the painkillers, are you?
I'm sorry. You are?
I'm Nurse Mackenzie. I'm neuroclinical.
I mean, I deal with anyone who comes
in here with neurological problems,
including grand mal seizures.
Right. So you'll know
that there are no contraindications
between his pain meds
and his seizure medication.
And you'll know that 80 milligrams
of codeine is hardly a responsible dosage
to give to someone who appears
to have problems with painkillers.
I think we should
give the family some peace and quiet.
Hmm?
All right.
Be right back.
I don't appreciate people casting
professional aspersions on me.
No, I was just...
Especially in front of a patient
and his family,
by someone who barely knows
the young man in question,
and is, in any case,
completely unqualified
to make judgments about
the patient's reliance on pain medication.
I'm his GP. You're a nurse.
Show some respect.
Mr. Carter
is under my care now.
Sorry about that.
Come in.
Lina.
- I'm interrupting.
- No, no. Um...
Excuse me.
Not at all. Please come in.
He must have rung the bell
right before it happened.
I think he did it to punish me.
I don't know which is worse.
Spending the rest of my life trying
to fix someone
that doesn't wanna be fixed...
...or admitting that...
...without him,
my life would be empty.
Caring for someone like Jamie
can be stressful.
It's none of my business.
But when was the last time
you had any fun?
Can't remember.
Well...
personally...
I'd recommend a holiday.
Somewhere hot.
Let your hair down.
Drink till you fall over.
Dance a lot.
Preferably the samba or the rumba.
Or possibly the mumba.
The mumba?
With who?
A friend.
Doctor's orders.
Stand up to them, Lina.
Fuck!
You all right?
Cut my foot.
Oh, well, hop in. I'll take you back
to the house and have a look at it.
No, thanks.
Don't be silly.
Let me help you. Look at you.
You're hobbling, and you're gonna ruin...
Lina.
I'm okay. It's just a cut.
Looks worse than it is.
You must think
I'm a bloody fool.
Sorry?
Come here.
Katherine... is there something wrong?
When I took you in, you had nothing.
Now I'm practically a lodger
in my own home,
which isn't even mine anymore.
I sunk everything I had into Rowling
and for what, hmm?
You've had a life for the last ten years
because I took over
and looked after Jamie.
I'm not his wife.
I'm his mother.
His nurse, his carer.
Different words for the same thing.
Servant.
This is your home.
It'll always be your home.
How dare you offer me the crumbs
from my own fucking table!
I don't have to take this anymore.
Then leave.
Why should I?
- Missed it.
- I'm just embarrassing myself now.
Close though.
I think you're getting better.
What was that?
Ugh, that was terrible.
I told you I was crap at tennis.
Crap is putting it mildly. Jesus.
- Now you're just showing off.
- Nice. Nice.
Get it! Get it!
Oh, my God!
New balls!
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
- Whiskey.
- Scotch?
Yeah.
There we go.
- Evening.
- Um...
- I'll have a Shiraz.
- Coming up.
I'm glad you called, Lina.
Is... everything okay?
I shouldn't have come.
I'll drive you home if you like.
Pull over.
Lina. Lina.
Yes.
Robert's coming over
for dinner this evening.
Perhaps you'd give us all
a little concert?
What?
Oh. I couldn't.
It's my birthday.
I know.
It's just I'm so out of practice.
It's only family.
No need to impress us.
Tell you what.
Why don't we pick you out a nice dress?
Something that shows off
that gorgeous young figure of yours.
I used to watch you on the telly
all the time.
You were a huge star.
Oh, Katherine, what happened?
What really happened?
Right, I know this is a bit premature,
but... this is an alphabet board.
What's gonna happen,
I'm gonna read out the letters, out loud,
and you're gonna blink.
E-S-A-R-I-N
T-U-L-O...
M-D-P-C-F-B...
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Katherine ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Thank you.
- She baked it herself.
- Oh.
- It was no trouble.
- Yes, it was.
Only a small piece for me.
I don't eat cake.
- Since when?
- She's gutted now.
She made it especially for you.
- I'm not gutted, Jamie.
- Liar.
It looks delicious, Lina.
We learned that tune together,
your mom and I.
I vowed that if I ever got rich,
the first thing I would do
is buy your mom a proper piano, so I did.
You bought the piano?
Did she not tell you?
Hmm.
We grew up together, Lina's mom and I.
Danielle.
We were like sisters.
I was always at her house. It was...
safer than the foster home.
I got out of poverty. She didn't.
I became a Hollywood star.
I didn't let it
affect our friendship, but, uh...
...Danielle did.
After I moved to America,
she stopped making any effort,
and... the more I reached out to her,
the more she cold-shouldered me,
until eventually,
she more or less cut me out completely.
Why would she do that?
Jealousy.
She broke my heart.
Not the first person
to shatter my faith in humankind.
Sadly, not the last.
That piano cost me 12 grand.
You abandoned her.
If she told you that,
she lied.
Bullshit!
My mom wasn't a jealous person.
You can bang on
about your own past all you want,
but don't you dare
paint a false picture of my mother.
She was... She was a million times
the woman you'll ever be.
Sorry to disappoint you, Lina,
but I was the one who maintained
our relationship, for your sake.
I was the one who flew you out
to California on school holidays,
who took you to Disneyland,
who insisted I become your legal guardian!
If it wasn't for me, you'd have ended up
in a foster home like I did.
You wanted to come home with me.
You wanted to live with me.
You hated that squalid little house
and your mom's bitterness and envy.
That's why you blame yourself
for what happened.
I don't have to listen to this.
She hasn't spent the last ten years
crawling around trying to please us
because she actually loves us.
She's here for herself. She's using us.
Using you?
What use are you to me?
This is my house now. Mine and Jamie's.
And there's fuck all you can do about it.
That told you.
Should someone go after her?
It's not me that she's in love with.
It's Katherine.
Ever since she got here,
all she ever wanted was your love.
It's all either of us ever wanted.
I do everything for them,
but it's never enough.
I worked my ass off to become a doctor
just to please my father.
And it left me empty.
Don't let them crush you.
Robert?
For fuck's sake.
What are you doing?
Just getting a glass of water.
Where were you today when I...
when I rang the bell?
You know, I... I know
about your little journal.
I know about everything
that goes on in this house.
I could have read it, but...
but I didn't,
because I respect you too much.
Read it.
You don't respect me.
You just don't wanna know
how I really feel.
- If it's so bad, why don't you just leave?
- Where would I go, Jamie?
What would I do?
I have no life outside of Rowling.
You've never let me get a job.
I don't know anyone.
- I've... I've never been anywhere.
- Do you think it's any different for me?
Huh? You think I like being sick
and... and weak and needy like this?
Locked in a body
that doesn't fucking work?
You're not locked in.
You choose this.
You use sickness.
You've used it your whole life
to keep yourself front and center,
and you used it to get me!
You and I made a deal.
I've protected you
from what goes on out there,
in a world where people disappear forever.
- Don't.
- She went to bed alone that night.
But maybe if you'd have been there.
Maybe if you'd have been there,
you would have heard her screams,
but, no, you abandoned her.
Didn't you?
You abandoned her, and you left her
to be murdered in her own fucking home.
Stop it.
That's what happens
when you leave people, Lina.
You lose them.
You lose everything.
You're nothing without me,
and you know it.
Wait.
Does he know about us?
I don't care anymore.
I do.
You would lose everything,
including your home.
I only want you.
Lina.
Why can't we just leave? You and me?
I am this family's GP.
That means I'm sleeping with a patient.
If that got out, I would lose my practice
and very probably my license.
They would ruin me.
I won't let them.
They've stolen my life from me.
I won't let them steal you.
If you want me...
if you want us...
then we have to be brave.
I'll do anything.
Anything.
I can't go on like this.
I'll go mad.
Boo! Surprise.
- Jamie's feeling better today.
- It's the new steroids.
I feel like Spider-Man.
Um, I made it myself.
Well, Robert helped me,
but it was my idea.
Thinking a nice, romantic picnic
on the island.
That was his suggestion.
He's quite the ladies' man, our Robert.
You should hear some of his stories.
Tart.
The island?
Yeah. Robert's gonna
row us out there, aren't you?
Only if you're absolutely sure
you feel well enough.
He thinks I'm scared.
I'm not a coward.
You're not strong enough to swim, Jamie.
You've never even learned.
Lina, we're only going on a boat.
It'll be fine.
Come on, let's... let's do this.
It's about to start raining.
Look, live a little. Come on.
You're always saying
I ought to do more exercise.
And... I wanna make it up to you.
Show you that I don't have to
always be such a bloody misery.
Look, I'm sorry about what I said.
All right, forgive me?
You're the last person in the world
that I'd wanna hurt. I love you.
I love you too.
Let's go. Okay.
- Okay?
- Yep.
There are people on the other side
of the island, cutting down trees.
I know.
Do as I say.
Get in the boat.
Now who's the one that's scared?
Will she get in? Won't she get in?
Come on, Lina.
It's only a little boat ride.
Don't be a spoilsport.
Finally.
It wasn't that hard, was it?
This is exciting, no?
It's cold.
There's a nice spot.
See that? That sandy bit.
We're going past it.
Where are you going?
Whoa, what are you doing?
You're missing the bloody island.
{\an8}You've dropped the oar, you idiot.
He's not much of a boatman, is he?
Careful.
Robert, what are you doing?
Robert, stop!
Jamie!
Robert!
- Help!
- Jamie!
Jamie!
Jamie! Jamie!
No, no, no!
No!
Well, you must
have known he couldn't swim.
It was in the local paper.
Whose idea was the boat trip?
Jamie's.
Really?
Hmm? It wasn't Dr. Lawrence's?
I've seen you both.
I've seen the way you are together.
How long's it been going on?
How long have you
been seeing Dr. Lawrence?
The boat capsized.
We all fell in. I...
I tried to save him, but he... he kept
flailing around, dragging me down.
And then, um...
...what, you, uh...
you couldn't divorce him
because you'd lose everything?
It tipped!
I... I don't remember why.
One of them must have lent over too far.
Is that why Jamie had to drown?
Look, the police, they're not gonna
give you the benefit of the doubt.
They're not.
The fact that you were dragged into this
by a doctor that everybody trusts.
Except me.
A doctor that deliberately
over-prescribed painkillers
to a patient he wanted to get rid of.
Lina, listen.
I know what it's like
to be pushed into a corner
when you're too frightened
to speak out against him.
No one dragged me into anything.
Shh!
He comes at night.
What are those?
Something to help you sleep.
I have to go.
I don't care where. Just far.
We can never be happy here, Robert.
Not with her.
- If she...
- Sell the house.
What?
It's yours to sell now.
It's... It's Katherine's home.
Forget about Katherine.
I can't... I can't sell it. I promised her.
Then what's the sense in what we did?
I risked everything for you.
For us.
This is how we get free, Lina.
If you sell Rowling, we'll never
have to worry about money again.
Is... Is that what this is all about?
- Money?
- No, it's about freedom.
Yours, as well as mine.
I won't do it.
Where did you get that?
It's all in here, Lina.
Your bile.
Page after page of murderous fantasy.
You even talk about drowning him.
Give it back! No!
You may think you're a good person,
but you're not.
You're no better than me,
except that you're a coward,
so you let me do your dirty work.
I held onto him.
Yes, but how tightly?
You seduced me.
Then you took your husband,
who can't swim,
out on the lake without a life jacket,
and you capsized the boat.
- It was you!
- Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Because I thought you loved me.
Katherine!
Katherine!
Katherine.
Lina, what's wrong?
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
I said move.
You bitch.
Cat out of the bag, is it?
Lina!
Lina!
Fuck off!
Lina. Lina, please, I can explain.
I loved you!
Come back. Come back to the house.
My house.
Just come.
Get off!
Lina!
Stop!
Lina, let me explain!
You're the one I love. Not her!
Lina, wait. Stop.
Oh, fuck.
Lina, where are you?
Lina.
Lina.
I just wanna talk to you.
Lina!
- Lina!
- Get away from me!
Let me in. Don't do this, Lina.
Open the fucking door!
Fuck's sake.
God!
- Look, I need to get in.
- I know!
Why are you trying to talk to her?
- To stop her going to the police.
- Let me try.
Lina.
Lina, come out,
and we can talk about this.
She's not gonna
wanna talk, not after what's happened.
She'll be scared.
Lina.
Stop her!
I know
you're not telling me everything, Lina.
Hey, you'll have to be quick.
'Cause me battery's about to run out.
Are you sure?
Can you make sure that,
um, she's... she's not left alone?
Right. I'll be there as soon as possible.
Come on.
Is he really worth protecting?
Come on, then.
Fuck a duck.
Right.
Again.
Yes.
Hallelujah!
Right. We're gonna start by you telling me
exactly what happened, all right?
I think I know,
but you need to tell me I'm right.
Okay.
Right.
Ready?
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U-L-O-M...
M?
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U...
U?
E-S-A-R...
Murder.
Did someone try to murder you?
They're using the alphabet board.
She'll fuck us both.
Calm down.
She tried to kill you, Lina.
I know that.
I tried to stop her.
Bullshit.
But if you go down, so do I.
So we have to work together on this.
And what exactly do you suggest we do?
We take her home.
Now.
Before she can talk to the police.
And then what?
We finish this.
Yeah, uh, police, please. Police.
I don't want to hurt you.
But I have to protect myself.
Okay.
Go on.
People with locked-in syndrome
usually suffer sudden, violent strokes.
Morphine and something to counteract
the blood thinner should do it.
She has a lot of medication
in her bloodstream,
which should cover our tracks.
What will we tell the police?
She was thrown from her horse.
She sustained serious head injuries.
She wandered into the road and got hit
by a driver who fled the scene.
It's all in the police report.
Whatever she told that nurse,
she was confused.
I discharged her. You brought her home.
She died in her sleep.
Oh, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.
They won't believe us.
Doesn't matter what they think,
as long as they can't prove it.
- What are you doing?
- Worried about dents in the car.
I fixed it.
Not properly.
You can still see a dent in the bumper.
Are you sure?
You need to clean the grill with alcohol,
in case of any traces.
For all we know,
the police are on their way. Hurry!
Oh, fuck.
There's nothing fucking here.
Lina, she didn't try to kill you.
She tried to stop him from killing you.
She blames herself for everything.
She tried to save your life, Lina.
That's how she ended up like this.
Lina!
Lina!
Lina!
You could have killed me.
Let her go.
We've still got the diary.
There's nothing she can do to hurt us.
Let her go. This was all a mistake.
You love her, Robert.
I despise the fucking pair of you.
If you hurt Lina,
I'll tell everyone the truth.
Did you try and stop him?
You tried to save my life?
Lina, are you there?
Lina?
Lina?
I'm here.
- Uh...
- What are you doing?
Waiting for you.
Get on with it.
Let me do it.
I wanna kill her myself.
You don't have the guts.
Try me.
Go on, then.
In the cannula.
You stupid...
You'd need treble
the dose to kill me.
Fucking...
What will you tell them?
