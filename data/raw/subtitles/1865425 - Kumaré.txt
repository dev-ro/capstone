Today is the unveiling.
At the unveiling,
we... unveil our true self.
You see,
I am not who you think that I am.
My name is Vikram Gandhi,
and I wasn't always a guru.
That's me. Yep, pretty cool. And
my brother was pretty cool too.
I come from
a long line of religious Hindus.
Like many first-generation immigrants,
my parents were determined not
to let America's great melting pot...
dilute our Indian traditions.
So they immersed me in Hindu mythology,
Indian philosophy and endless ritual.
Most American kids my age
worshipped Hulk Hogan.
But I was exposed
to a whole different set of heroes.
At times, these ancient rituals seemed like
little more than a source of public embarrassment,
and I began to question why we
needed religion in the first place.
Religion is life, and life is religion.
Maybe this was all just a bunch of
nonsense somebody made up a long time ago.
Despite my growing skepticism,
I remember watching my
grandmother perform morning prayers...
and seeing this great sense
of calm sweep over her.
That feeling must have come from somewhere.
I studied religion in college,
hoping to find spiritual answers.
But it backfired.
I only became more of a skeptic.
By the time I was an adult and
ready to leave my religion behind,
America was embracing the very
same tradition I was trying to escape.
Yoga had become the answer
to all of our Western problems.
For me, it's like... It's the only time when
I kind of shut down my inner voices, like,
"You should do that. Oh,
you should lose some weight."
And a five-billion-dollar-a-year industry.
The messengers of this movement
called themselves gurus.
They dressed like Indian monks
and swamis...
and drew their credibility from
thousands of years of Indian spirituality,
whether they had a claim to it or not.
I wanted to know if these spiritual
leaders were for real or just full of it,
so I started to make
a documentary about them.
You know, I think he's right up
there in the ranks of the angels.
Uh... And I've been waiting for a teacher
like this for so long, Vikram, you know.
Many were all too willing to
enjoy the fruits of their power.
If I was a 20-year-old girl, I
would love hanging out with me.
You-You'd follow me?
I would just love that.
He's the new teacher
of this age, of this world.
"He's having sex with all the young
girls. He cannot be a real guru." Why not?
He's the one who has the answer.
That's what I believe.
What could be more fabulous than having
sex with a really spiritual, mystical person?
Wow.
These people
insisted they were somehow different...
than everyone else
in some inexplicable way.
But none of them seemed
any different to me.
So how do you figure out who's real?
Only the one who carries that
power to transmit it nonverbally.
That's how you know.
I traveled to India, hoping to find...
a true spiritual teacher
that I could believe in.
But the Indian gurus were just as
phony as the ones I had found in America.
When I was eight, I was given this
divine touch by the master. One touch.
Just he touched me, like, here. And...
A lot of the gurus I met claimed to
be more authentic than other gurus.
They don't teach history to us.
Just they get money from them.
And they say, "Okay, make long
beard. Make long dreadlocks.
And live like a Baba, dress like a Baba."
I felt like the gurus were
trying to out-guru each other.
To go to God and to live in
spiritual is very different.
And very difficult
to live a spiritual life.
Even people who said they weren't gurus
were often treated by others as if they were.
I guess my problem wasn't with spirituality.
It was just with spiritual leaders.
- Why did we need them?
- Oh, there's a store. Let's go shopping.
She's sexy, man. Huh?
Fuckin' sexy, man. Huh?
I wanted to prove
to others who were looking for answers...
that no one is more spiritual
than anyone else.
That spiritual leaders are just illusions.
And we are the ones
who decide who and what is real.
So I thought, "What if I
became a spiritual leader?
If I could do it, wouldn't
it prove anyone could?"
With a few cosmetic changes,
I could easily look like a guru.
So I let my hair grow out and my beard.
I started practicing yoga
and meditation every day.
I felt the effects almost immediately.
- Now all I needed was to imitate my grandmother's voice.
- Hello.
♪ Yeah! ♪
♪ Hey, hey Hey, hey ♪
At first it was fun. It was a prank.
- Hello.
- How are you? Good to meet you, guru.
- Nice to meet you.
- Is that how you go by?
- Or is there another name we should call you?
- What would you like to call me?
I don't know. They told me
I should call you guru.
Yes. Very good.
I wanted to try out my disguise
in a more formalized setting.
So I got my friend to book my
guru alter ego as a guest teacher...
at a local yoga studio.
Can you just, uh, move?
I created a series of made-up chants.
And I taught nonsense rituals and yoga moves.
People seemed to like it.
I thought of that inner peace I'd
found while sitting with my grandmother.
Was that real?
Could people find the same peace
from a made-up religion...
that they found in a real one?
Could I really pull this off?
I felt connected to you right away.
Um... Something about you.
I was like... I don't know. Like I was,
like, "I'll just follow him anywhere."
This is the story of the
biggest lie I've ever told...
and the greatest truth
I've ever experienced.
It's about the time I pretended
to be a wise guru from the East...
and started a following
of real people in the West.
This is the story of Kumaré.
It was time to start my experiment...
living as the guru Kumaré.
I chose Phoenix, Arizona, because I
figured people there would be open...
to the teachings of an Eastern guru.
And if I was gonna pull this off
without getting caught,
I needed a place where nobody
would recognize me.
I was gonna need help, so I brought
with me Purva to book events...
and Kristen to help spread
Kumaré's teachings to the yoga world.
They would be Kumaré's first
followers and greatest public supporters.
Together, we set out to spread
the teachings of Sri Kumaré.
This was our house
and our temporary ashram.
I moved my bedroom outside so I could sleep
like all the gurus and swamis I'd met in India.
I taught Kristen my fake yoga moves...
and began writing down the
basics of the Kumaré philosophy.
As a guru, all I would teach
people was that I was an illusion.
But in order to find students
I could teach this to,
I needed to establish myself
in the community.
So Purva began booking classes.
Okay, see you Sunday for three hours.
Okay, bye. Booked!
So, it's Inner Vision Studio
in, uh, Phoenix.
They have, like,
three or four locations, and...
It's such a huge place that I-I personally
think we'll get, like, 40, 50 people in there.
Good job.
When we talk about
Kumaré, Kumaré means "divine child."
It's more of a title rather than
a name like any of us have.
This is, um, from, uh, The Kumaré Sutra.
Uh, Chapter 3, Section 12.
"The seeker who finds the teacher
feeds himself with the milk of wisdom,
like a child at a mother's teat,
nurtured by faith
in the dream of Pinkaloka."
Right side,
left side. Right side, left side.
This is good for when we're feeling stuck.
- In what part of life you use yoga to help?
- Uh...
Life problem sometime heal from yoga.
I have a really stressful job.
What your job is?
- I'm a death penalty attorney.
- Oh!
I'm the one who, at the last
minute, tries to call the governor...
to save the life of my client who's
going to be killed by the government.
Okay. You need someone to be that
one who calls your governor to save you.
Yeah. Can you teach me?
It's fascinating, but it's very dangerous 'cause
your heart gets bound up with these people.
All people who want to do good,
they sometime forget...
that they also have to
do good for themselves.
Kumaré is more than a teacher, you know.
He's more than just putting you
through the asanas and all that.
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.
You were all wonderful.
Toby was a smart lady.
And much to my surprise,
she felt a connection to Kumaré.
As much time as he can spend,
I would be happy to spend.
In order to find more people like
Toby, we needed to spread the word.
He holds up the mirror for you.
But not literally. Metaphorically.
♪ Kumaré, Kumaré, Kumaré ♪
♪ Cheshli, Kumaré ♪
♪ Cheshli, Kumaré ♪ - ♪ Kumaré ♪
We know the answer's inside.
We just need someone to bring it
out in us. And that's what he does.
- Holds the mirror up.
- So everybody's truth is going to be different.
I see myself in other people,
and people, I know, will look at
myself and see what they want to see.
I met Guruji, and I swear
he's fresh out of the Himalayas.
There's something about him that is
truly unique. He's just a simple man.
There's nothing, uh, phony about him.
Kumaré is a being that is open towards
everything in a nonjudgmental way.
- Thank you.
- The more students I met...
and classes I taught, the more it seemed
the Kumaré movement could take hold.
I just wanted to have a
little bit of your energy.
The people that feel that connection
towards him and they see him,
and they're, like, "Teach
me! Bring it in. Bring it in."
People were asking for my blessing,
so I just started to imagine
I had this blue light,
this pure love inside me, and
I would just shoot it onto them.
Focus blue light... your forehead.
I didn't know what I was doing, but
people seemed so fascinated by me.
He just has this infectious laugh, and
you feel like you've known him all your life.
For some reason, I just know that I'm gonna
have a little bit more time with this guy.
♪ Kumaré, Kumaré, Kumaré ♪
♪ Kumaré, Kumaré, Kumaré ♪
I kept inventing my own spiritual jargon.
And what I was saying
often made little sense.
- U-wa-é.
- U-wa-é.
This one you say like "Om."
But because we say that,
whole world change.
My backstory was equally convoluted.
If they ask, "Where you from?" I
say, "Halikash. This one from my mind.
You have problem?"
Basically, I was just
telling everybody I was fake.
This whole thing like a show, right?
This one, this guy in a dress, looking this.
All show.
As Vikram, I
defined myself as where I lived, who I knew.
But as Kumaré, I was nobody.
I was an empty vessel.
- They call me Kumaré.
- Ku-mar-lé.
- Kumaré. Ku... Ku... Kumaré.
- Kuma...
- Kumarlé?
- Kumaré.
Eh, my English isn't that good.
And for once, I was capable of anything.
When he would focus
on the different chakras,
I was just on fire.
It's very powerful.
It was interesting trying to teach...
a Himalayan yogi master some magic tricks.
Whoa!
- Don't do that.
- But he pulled it off really well.
Why did everyone love being around Kumaré?
I actually immediately felt
better in his presence.
It's the first time I've ever
had contact with a genuine guru.
- I am a... from a place called the Halikash.
- Excuse me?
And why did I love being him?
I like to play games. - Okay.
- All the time.
- I also like to play games.
Oh.
I have intense feelings
about the whole planet.
As Kumaré, I got to
be happy all the time. That was my job.
- You are aware, you are... You are looking intently.
- I am not. Why do you...
Get out of my head! No...
This symbol is your religion symbol?
No, no. It's just Mickey Mouse.
I could tell that he was very,
very special before I even met him.
There's a white glow,
um, in tight against your body.
It's so pure and bright and
white. It's just absolutely beautiful.
Living as
Kumaré was starting to rub off on me.
It's like when your mother tells you,
"Be careful what face you make
because it will stay like that."
I feel myself getting warmer than
normal. I'm sure that's your energy.
And I see behind you
the whole sea of other Kumarés,
and they all stand behind you,
and they just rise behind you.
I see almost a "V." It
feels that it is your turn...
to be here and be the embodiment...
of that energy now.
It's as if you marinated in it...
before you came here.
I would see him
in an ascended master status.
It-It just seems a little different than
some of the others I experienced.
And I-I... I'm sure there's realms that
I've never witnessed or experienced.
- Can you see a Vikrama?
- I'm not sure what that is.
What I see is purple with the red above.
And I feel Metatron, Archangel Metatron.
All back, coming up. Then you come like this.
- So, like this, the whole body.
That when you don't... -
Have a... you have proper...
inhale, exhale like that.
Exhale, inhale. Exhale.
What is illusion? What is truth?
You don't know if I am good, I am bad.
You don't know that.
All you know is how you see people act.
Good morning.
The illusion aspect of it to me was,
you know, we create who we are.
- Thank you.
- Yes. Bobby.
- Bobby.
- Yes.
I started noticing
the same people returning to class.
There was Kimberly, who often sat
quietly in the back and never spoke to me.
Greg, who was always eager
to get a spot in the front.
And Stewart, who loved eating
free samples at grocery stores.
- But you can get a lot of little samples.
- Yeah.
And sometimes when you go there,
it's not just for the food.
It's because you know the people
giving it to you, and you talk to them,
and it becomes like a little
community, like you're talking...
Stewart... - I think so.
Okay.
And then there was Emily, who very quickly
began to confide in me about her personal life.
Remember, I have a husband too. - Okay.
He-He's the polarity of me.
So it's hard when... It's hard
when you can't reflect one another.
- Have to trick, fake... trick sometimes.
- Trick!
- Trick, fake.
- Fake.
I don't know his history.
It's not something...
that he brings to the table...
it's not the point.
Oh, you are not average.
- Thank you.
- Ah.
I would love to know him
even more, but I don't.
You know, this is just my impression of,
you know, a couple hours here and there.
- It's okay, okay.
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
See you soon. See you soon. - Okay.
I'll see you. - Okay.
Are you going...
Kumaré's
presence in Phoenix was taking shape,
but the real test would be if people stayed
interested, even after I'd left for a while.
So I went to Tucson,
where a man named Darrell...
had invited me to share in
his unique spiritual practice.
Greetings. Come in.
When he came, I didn't know
what to think, to be honest with you.
I did look up on the Web, you
know, and saw some things about him,
and I was really excited about him coming.
In the Bible, it says, "In the
beginning was the Word."
"The Word" is vibration, sound, okay?
God is sound. The sound that intoxicates,
the sound that's bliss and ecstasy.
To find the sound in their body.
This is, uh, a fake.
A fake one.
- They want Kumaré be guru.
- Yeah.
- I say, "Okay, come."
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
But then I say, "No, I am not."
They realize that one. You don't know that.
- You know that.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Good.
- Always.
And then we went back to the healing
room. And I did a session with him.
And hold. Hold. Arm down at your
side. Good. Keep holding. Keep holding.
Let your body drop.
Let everything go through you.
And just feel yourself
getting lighter and lighter.
Keep the breath going.
Yeah.
That's good.
Good. Good.
Pure pleasure. Breathe it up.
- Ah. Joy and divine bliss, which is our birthright.
- Ahh.
Ahh.
- I had goose bumps coming all over my arms.
- Two more.
As soon as I would look at him or connect
with the energy, it would just go all over me.
Two more!
Now hold it in you.
Hold it. Keep holding. Come back. I got
you. I got you. Keep holding. Keep holding.
I don't know what that means, but it
just felt like there was some memory,
some remembrance coming there,
uh, because his spirit was so
beautiful, and I was just in alignment.
Now with your hands, you
offer this sound out to the room,
like a big ball of blue
light inside middle of room.
Don't worry. Make your sound.
- Huh!
- Say your sound. Everyone together say your sound.
When you come up, you will release.
Release now.
♪ Ooh, jah, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma ♪
♪ Ooohhh ♪
♪ Ahhhhhh! ♪
Together.
Your blessing gave a blessing, uh, to me...
because I am too often
enthralled by the sound of sound...
instead of the silence of sound.
Thank you very much for that blessing.
I connected with that. Namaste.
The power
of illusion was greater in Tucson...
than I'd ever imagined.
I knew I would never see
these people again...
Hello. Mr. Life?
So I wanted to see how far I could push it.
So I have a Western doctoral
degree from the university.
- You're a doctor of philosophy.
- Yes.
This is how I give you...
all symbol of a Pinasignore.
Life. 'Cause that is all.
People wanting... you deserve
to find happiness.
So you can open eyes, and you look.
See your feeling.
You will have to use
this image like a mirror.
All symbol. Just a symbol.
Nothing inside altar.
It felt like, uh,
experiencing... bliss and light.
And I can, uh, feel the energy...
of him and I connecting in the ritual.
He's someone who I can express
my energy through,
and he could express energy through me.
U-wa-é, Kumaré.
U-wa-é, Kumaré.
U-wa-é, Kumaré.
Full moon is tomorrow.
Do you watch the moon?
Sometime woman have
more feeling from moon...
- than man, yes?
- Than men.
It's pretty incredible.
- 28-day cycle.
- Hmm.
I love your house.
- You like my bedroom?
- Yeah.
You're making me have some... Inspired.
I'm totally inspired.
What you have been thinking
for last week about your life?
I'm very aware of power versus force.
And I feel like I've been forcing
my marriage to work for a long time,
and forcing and fighting.
Do you remember that person you were...
when you first meeting your husband?
Was it someone different, you?
- Mmm.
- Huh?
I don't even believe in marriage.
He's not the same.
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I don't wanna be there.
Hmm.
I wanna go.
So, that's easy.
But you feel alone
without a man in your life?
No, I never did.
So, um, I get to do whatever I want now.
What do you think? What do you feel?
Would a real guru have told her...
to ditch her husband
and become his student?
I wanted to tell
her to stay with her husband,
but I barely knew this woman.
Despite this costume, I wasn't in any
place to advise someone I didn't really know.
Within a week, Emily
had left town for California.
The longer I stayed in Phoenix,
the more people approached me...
with deep personal questions
and stories of suffering.
And what?-what do you do when
you're feeling down and depressed?
- What is that?
- Wha-What do you do when you're feeling down and depressed?
- What do you usually do?
- It wasn't always easy to hear or respond to.
We had a... a very mean father.
He beat and, um, sexually
abused all of us kids.
And he would tell us, if we told
our mom, he would kill our mom,
so we had to be quiet and
not say anything, you know?
The truth was
that under this beard and this outfit,
I was just like them.
Okay. So, my family is from this place.
It does not show Halikash,
but we don't advertise that place.
So when we come to visit you,
how do we get a hold of you?
- E-mail?
- You will find. Don't worry.
- Ah, see, I like the way Guruji eats.
- Mm-hmm.
That's... And that's the way you're
supposed to eat with raw foods.
Yeah. - I used to drink a lot.
I used to, you know, chase women.
- I used to do all sorts of things.
- Okay.
On top of all that, I
developed a cocaine habit.
- And so I used to...
- Coca? Coca?
Cocaine. I used to inject it.
Cocaine in arm. Okay.
- My life spiraled down.
- Okay.
This one night... You know, I'd
been up all night smoking crack.
And that morning she came back,
and-and she said, um, "Greg, I'm leaving."
And I said, "Okay. Um...
I need to go get help."
And so, six years ago is when I got clean.
- And so, then we had to repair our lives together.
- That took a while.
And when we got married, the one
thing we knew we were going to do...
is put God first.
And-And-And helping others
became the most important thing.
The most important thing...
just what you're doin' right here,
by coming here and helping others.
- The most important thing you can do.
- Yeah.
Was I helping anyone?
Was I even capable of helping anyone?
I would blame the crazy guy.
Despite my self-doubt, more and
more people wanted to meet Kumaré.
An organic farm near the Mexican
border, called Avalon Gardens,
had invited me to teach a yoga class
during their annual Be Aware Festival.
And you bring this pelvis up.
Don't squeeze your buttocks.
Just bring this one up, soft.
After class, I took some time
to get to know the students.
How did you know to come to this place?
When I came and met Gabriel and Niann,
I knew that that prophecy of when I
was 12 years old, from my Mormon church,
had come true... that I found
a strange new language,
the Fifth Epochal Revelation,
and continuing.
- We're from different planets.
- We were told we're "spirit lovers."
- "Spirit lovers"?
- Spirit lovers.
- We're from different planets but the same universe.
- You are from?
- Avalon is the universe.
- Yes.
- I am from the planet Solano.
- Okay.
- And she is from the planet Alcyon.
- Okay.
This place was unique.
And it all had something to do
with a man named Gabriel.
The Urantia Book.
It's called Urantia because...
the Urantia is the name of our planet,
according to the inhabited
worlds of time and space.
But it has to do
with allowing, uh, beings...
to take over my body and speak through me.
My soul...
It has evolved to-to... where they
can trust me, uh, hopefully.
- Uh, purity of soul.
- Okay.
- Ah.
- Hope you see... Hope you can see that.
I see. - Yeah.
NBC's Dateline
had done an hour-long investigation...
on Gabriel of Urantia.
I'm dangerous here.
Just like a Corvette.
They claimed he forced people to give
up their belongings and their identities...
to their cosmic family.
All I saw was a group of positive
and kindhearted environmentalists...
who had decided to remove themselves
from the capitalist pains of American life...
For greener, more epic pastures.
- Knock, knock.
- Looking like small people.
I know. - Looking like... What is that one?
- Hobbits.
- Yes! That one...
This is a hobbit house.
Do you watch movies?
- I... I watch... I like a movie, yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah. I am director.
Over 100 people
lived in or around this 80-acre compound.
Some for nearly 20 years.
They grew their own food and
had plans to move off the grid.
You give some direction?
Life direction, you give them?
We have a, uh... a-a
rehabilitation program...
for what, uh-uh... what we call
socially disappointed, uh, people.
Young people...
that can't deal with the, uh... the system.
They can't deal with the
third dimension actually.
We call our reality "the fourth dimension."
Everyone seemed genuinely happy.
But is this how cults
get people to join them?
By showing them how happy they are?
Isn't that what people saw in Kumaré?
Bump, bump, bump.
A biggie bump, bump.
The next morning, Gabriel sat me down...
to tell me what really
inspired him to start Urantia.
I didn't realize it, but I was
physically taken onto a craft...
a spacecraft.
But they cut it out of his memory. Yeah.
Yeah. They cut it out of my memory...
until years later,
and they brought it back.
And they said that I would have what's called
the mandate of the Bright and Morning Star.
- These people know that they need you?
- Mm-hmm.
- Would... What people? These...
- That you are...
- Oh, I see.
- Students know that they...
- I think they know.
- They know they need you? - Yes.
After 20 years, Gabriel still insisted...
he was the community's
only connection to God.
He reminded me why I created
Kumaré in the first place...
to show that leaders like him
were just illusions.
I always planned to unveil
my true identity.
But first, as Kumaré, I had to
teach something I believed in.
And I would start with my own story.
First teacher of Kumaré,
his name is Vikram.
Basic family.
His father was a medicine man.
His mother...
His mother name Jyoti, which
mean "light." Part of basic family.
At that time,
he is becoming a teacher for many people.
And he is the only one who did
not know that he was a teacher.
Why is it that? Because
he is feel like a disguise.
He is living in a disguise.
But all these people, they feel good.
So if other people have idea
for that story,
if that same story they have in themself?
A certain tree bears a certain fruit.
- Mm-hmm.
- Their actions. What they do.
- Their service.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm. To others... how they
treat others. That's what I hear.
And then the story you're telling me,
I think you're talking about yourself.
I was talking about self, yes.
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.
He is here trying to learn
about American culture...
and this society.
Since we're both learning from each other,
I just feel like there's a kind of
harmonious connection going on there.
In many ways,
Kumaré was an ideal version of myself.
So if other people could create
an ideal version of themselves,
maybe they would become happier too.
So what are you... you are doing?
Now, in your life, you are doing what?
I don't know. I'm, like, kind of stuck.
I don't wanna jump into a career.
I don't wanna put on a suit and
go to work every day in an office...
and sit at a computer and type all day.
- That doesn't seem fun to me.
- Yes.
I wanna be able to,
you know, go with the flow,
change with the wind, you know.
"Go with the flow"? - Yeah.
- "Change with the wind."
- Yeah.
Okay.
If you can imagine yourself
as someone else... - Mm-hmm.
That you feel is more true
than your... your form now,
then you can make those two become one.
Then you will not have some
feeling that I am not doing what I want.
You will always feel... Is it right?
We call this one "Blue Light" meditation.
The Blue Light
was another thing I had made up.
This one good. But you do slow together.
But now, it was becoming something real.
And you look, focus other
person face, into eyes, okay?
Until you feel yourself
inside other person, okay?
Imagine that.
U-wa-é.
U-wa-é.
- U-wa-é.
- And for the first time,
- I felt the Blue Light.
- U-wa-é.
There are so many gurus in
India. I have seen many of them.
They are just fake.
They are just fake gurus...
because they just want attention
and maybe money and fame.
But meeting Kumaré,
I thought he had
the positive mind and attitude.
So I think he's a real teacher.
Only your reflection, your mind,
your blue self, pure self.
His teachings have
already affected my teachings.
It just confirms for me...
how much people want to know
more, and they don't know where to start.
They're searching for something,
for answers.
You can come like this. You looking very
comfortable. You can... So come like that.
In religion, they have temple, church...
all this idea.
But this space,
like you call "sacred space."
But you did not need that.
Illusion is that this place...
is somehow better than outside.
It is very nice, Tish. I thank you.
But... you can find yoga center inside.
If you can bring yoga center inside...
remember yoga center inside you...
you will get that feeling
you have in here outside.
Tish insisted on
hosting a concert in honor of Sri Kumaré.
I wanted to understand what she saw in me.
I feel like there's these other great
teachers that have things to pass on,
and I don't know if I do.
I feel like I've hit a ceiling,
somewhat, to what I can convey.
What do you see in this Kumaré
lineage that you have some interest in?
I know exactly what it is.
And it was the meditation where you
were, um, talking about the blue light...
and that we all have what we're
searching for within ourselves.
And-And your meditation was more direct
than anything I've read or experienced.
If I teach you this, uh,
- Blue Light meditation...
- Mm-hmm.
And then you... you say, "All right, I-I
understand this Kumaré-man. He is not right.
- I believe in him. Then he is not right. I don't like."
- Mm-hmm.
Then will you throw that meditation?
- Would I? Probably not.
- It is good.
No. Yeah.
So that is more important.
Kirtan is my thing. I love it.
And that's what I could offer.
And Tish loves it, so we could do that as
kind of a thank-you gesture for Sri Kumaré.
I consider Kumaré to
be a living embodiment of the divine.
So I-I just wanna make sure that I
was welcoming him and honoring him...
in a way that matched who he is.
I guess what he's helped me remember...
is the illusion
that we're separate from God.
And that... that a guru, you know,
of God-realization is no more...
is no more closer to God than we are.
So I hope he has listeners
because people can benefit from him.
And I'm very grateful to him.
The three of us, we have
law of attraction groups,
and we teach and we share law of
attraction with people here in Phoenix.
And we don't have to worry
about the science part.
We just need to just know
that it's happening.
- You have a faith in this one.
- Absolutely.
- Just like the law of gravity works.
- Yeah.
When we have our meeting
groups... Sandy, Eric and I...
we teach people different ways
'cause everybody's different, right?
And some people like to have
something to look at.
So we teach them how to create
vision boards. We call them vision boards.
- Vision?
- Vision.
I had a desire to go to Africa
and to work with the children.
So I put a vision board with
the children in Africa here.
I wanted to go there and teach them...
and teach them, you know, yoga...
teach them all kinds of things.
But I didn't know...
that the man that I loved
was gonna be in Africa.
It just all showed up together...
based on my vision, my feelings.
That's law of attraction.
- You look in a magazine and find your dream.
- Yes.
Then you say I want to have
this house and this car.
And if you believe that... - Yeah.
- Then you will get this house and this car.
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Absolutely.
- We're actually going to be having...
a group meeting on Thursday
that we want to invite you to.
We'd love for you to come and meet
more people that study law of attraction.
It's gonna be a real intimate group.
Probably about 10, 15 people
are going to be there,
and they'd like to all share
their experiences with you...
and have you learn more
about law of attraction.
I will make my vision board and come.
Good.
Welcome to our law of attraction meeting.
Who's excited to be here tonight? Yay!
Whoo!
All the way from India, ladies
and gentlemen, Sri Kumaré.
Yay!
Your mood or
feelings or vibration create your reality.
Who wants to say "kabam" for
me? Let's build some energy up.
Ready? I'll say it. On the
count of three. One, two, three.
Kabam!
We're gonna talk
about lots of things today,
but the main goal tonight of our
group is to talk about visualization.
To me abundance isn't all about money.
And so, I put a certain amount
of money down here...
because sometimes I forget
that I need to connect with that.
Um, but it's not what drives me.
- So it works...
- Sorry to interrupt you.
- You have to sit down for a second.
- Okay.
Does that... But does it... - Who thinks
it's a wonderful evening out tonight?
Because we're gonna finish this outside.
They've asked us to leave. We
have to leave the building right now.
- Oh.
- Yeah, I know. It isn't that exciting, is it?
The next thing I wanna do... We
have a few more things to cover,
but I really wanna see
Kumaré's vision boards.
- Who wants to see Kumaré vision boards?
- Yeah.
Okay, this one is myself a student.
Old-time photograph.
Myself student.
This one is myself a teacher.
So that is why I want to...
combine my old self Vikram...
with my current self Kumaré...
so that I have inside peace
with all balance.
This one is a symbol for happiness.
And so that is why I put all
these people, and I put a smile.
A smile. Yeah.
So that this one, all these people,
they will... after unveiling... they
will also have the same happiness...
that they have when meeting me.
That was great.
- I love your vision board.
- Kumaré, thank you.
When do "kabam" mantra together?
- Kabam!
- Okay. Kabam!
- One, two, three.
- Kabam!
So this was actually kind
of like a vision board,
and then... Look who's
in my house right now.
So that's kind of the way
law of attraction works.
Kumaré talks a lot about the illusion.
You trick us.
Big trick.
He has great knowledge. I
believe he's like kind of prophet.
I am the biggest faker that I know.
I fake so much, I forget who I was before.
I've done other personal development work,
but this time I felt like... and I've
said this to a few people in the group...
that it changed my D.N.A.
Two days before I met you, Kumaré,
I lost my job.
We've been going through a lot of
changes already from him coming here...
'cause he can't work
'cause he's not a resident.
So all of this happened just two
days before we met you.
- So... Yeah.
- And that was good.
Guruji showed up in time...
to just kind of like take us
by the hands, so to speak,
and just kind of help us find
the way to do this big vision.
♪ Cha, cha ♪
He has this great power...
to make the others happy.
I think it's very, very
amazing. I feel very blessed.
It's probably the most amazing
thing that's ever happened to my life.
Yes.
A core group of disciples had emerged,
so we invited them into our home.
So what was it about him
that made you come here?
Nothing really let me know that
this guy is what I've been looking for.
But I went home, and I
couldn't get him out of my mind.
And the next day, I couldn't
get him out of my mind.
I kept thinking about him.
Just kept thinking about him.
And the thoughts were always good.
They were always very positive.
Everything about him was very positive.
It's like a snowball rolling downhill.
It's like, "Wow. I got to see this guy."
And I was talking to my
wife today, and I was saying...
I said, "You might not like this,
Wendy, but I think I love this man."
What he's bringing is like a science...
It's like law of attraction, right?
He's a doctor. Actually,
he's a doctor, right?
Kumaré came along and said,
"Well, you don't really need...
Here's the idea.
I'll help you to find
whatever's inside you,
but you're gonna have to teach yourself.
I can teach you how to teach
yourself that, but I'm not gonna be here."
Which is true of all teachers.
They don't stick around.
Kumaré was
a reflection of everyone's dreams,
not just my own.
Kumaré was a mirror, a tool that
allowed people to look inside themselves.
Basic idea of
mirror philosophy is identity.
What I am doing...
myself, my life, my student...
is creating that dream life...
and real life together.
And whole point is to use
this process, this teaching...
through myself...
to use as a mirror for yourself.
You create inside your mind
which direction you will go.
Easy one.
You just use that like this.
So that you can calm
your energy together...
And lose some identity.
You lose all that feeling in your body.
You begin to remove all the inside.
Feel your mind.
Become like a pathway...
and begin to feel a blue light.
And offer your hands out to center.
I had found my teaching,
and it was something I believed in.
Now I found my students.
There was Greg, who saw
Kumaré's simple lifestyle and wanted it.
Stewart, a retired salesman who was
looking for a way to connect with people.
Molly, who had a lot of people telling
her what to do and liked that Kumaré didn't.
Teresa and her new husband Riad,
who saw in Kumaré a self-help
teacher they could learn from.
Toby, who sought an escape
from her stressful job.
Rachel, a medical student, and
her boyfriend Bobby, an entrepreneur.
And Kimberly, a single mother
coping with the reality of an empty nest.
Today I embrace illusion to find truth.
In the time I had left with my students,
I wanted to teach them that
they could help themselves...
and that they never needed
a guru in the first place.
I just can't believe that he would come
and spend this much time with individuals.
So this one, to help unite your identity.
You have to break down all feeling.
The things he's told me are the
things that I know I should be doing.
Hello. Good to see you.
Kumaré's impact on our
relationship will be positive.
I think it's already there.
Do you want to know every truth about him?
Probably not.
And do you want to know
every truth about her?
I'm gonna say, probably not, you know?
You can feel really the change inside you.
That's very exciting.
Kumaré number one!
He has the most peaceful energy,
and you can feel it around him.
It seems to touch the people
that he comes in contact with.
You can perceive from Kumaré...
all of the wonder and excitement
and enthusiasm for everything.
This is the guest bathroom.
Guest toilet. All right. Okay.
Very beautiful toilet. Yes.
We shall sit here? Yes, on the floor?
Would you... Yeah. Okay.
The kind of law that I practice
is really life and death, literally.
Yeah.
It's usually murder plus something...
especially awful.
Why do you want to help those people?
Because nobody else will.
You know, they're people
that society's thrown away.
Even their own families don't
talk to 'em most of the time.
When somebody else shows
interest in what you're interested in,
it makes you wanna know them better.
It makes you want to learn
as much as you can.
Your place, like your heaven, is
that underneath the sea place, yes?
Scuba dived a lot.
I dive, um, as much as I can.
- So you have this one on face, and you are going down?
- Right?
You jump in.
You're breathing.
Now you're at 20 feet or so,
and you're starting to see
some coral and some things.
You're gonna kick a little bit.
And there's just deep
blue water beneath you.
You have very good imagination.
Maybe this one good meditation for you.
It's good. I'm looking at the shells.
You can imagine the
cat is also some catfish happening.
Let's dive a wreck.
We'll go and dive a wreck.
And all of a sudden we see
two big, huge green moray eels.
They're big... big ol' sharp
head with big ol' sharp teeth,
and they've got their mouths open.
Big ol' mouths open.
You know how when you see somebody
that you haven't seen for a very long time...
and you run and hug them and you cry...
because you're happy to see them?
That's the only kind of way
I can explain it.
But I felt very much...
an affinity for Kumaré.
All right.
- I think we're good now.
- Okay.
Thank you. We'll see you on Saturday.
Thank you.
So the exercise you will do with Guruji...
is called identity transference.
And what you will do...
is imagine that you are Guruji...
and that Guruji is you.
Tell him the five commands
that you've written to yourself...
as if you are speaking to yourself.
You will meditate one hour every day.
First thing you need to do
is pay off your bills.
The money's a problem.
I want you to love yourself.
To stop going out to stores all
day long and eating free food.
And to give yourself a hug every day.
- O-O-Okay. Okay.
- I broke your board.
Thank you, okay.
You will think positive
whenever you talk with others.
And you will stop taking
the neighbor's newspaper...
and reading it and putting it back.
Kind thoughts... all the time.
This one is to remember.
You are doing action.
U-wa-é.
Cha.
This whole thing is a big trick...
to help people realize
that they do not need a guru.
That everything they want,
all their happiness,
is inside themself.
That the same good
that you see inside this man,
you also have inside yourself.
That you did not need a guru
to make yourself happy.
Because the truth is that I am
only the same as everyone here.
And everyone here, to me,
has become my greatest gurus...
in my life.
Look at your candle love light.
That is a reflection of your light inside.
You can put this light inside the water.
This ideal self
is now entering the ocean...
that have all problem of life.
And your ideal self
must go inside the water.
Hi. Welcome.
Sorry. My hands are all wet.
- How are you?
- Hey.
For many, many years...
I've been looking for something
to help me look inside myself.
This is my daughter.
And this is my only one. I have
three boys and my daughter.
- Yeah.
- And she's the baby.
She's the one
that started college this year.
That's my daughter-in-law...
her getting ready.
Good.
My kids are very blessed.
They have great partners.
The same father?
- Yes. All of them have the same father.
- Okay.
Yeah, we divorced about 20 years ago.
Okay.
He's not been in their life too much.
It was meant to be. I was meant
to meet him, have my children.
They were the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
They're my... They are actually my success,
my children are, I think.
So, you know, it happens. It was hard.
- I worked two or three jobs.
- Oh.
Yeah. I was always working. I'd sleep
maybe two hours, three hours a day.
But how do you give to yourself now?
That's the hardest thing. I don't know how.
When you're a person that gives a lot,
to return and do it for yourself,
I feel selfish.
I feel like I'm a bad person because I do.
So it's hard.
- Hard to love self as much as children.
- It is.
I do know what I need to do.
I just need somebody to listen.
I need somebody to guide me and to help me,
not telling me,
"This is what you need to do."
Like getting a trainer, "Do this."
If I get a trainer, I'm, like, "Forget it."
I'm not gonna do it 'cause
I'm stubborn and I won't do it.
And imagine that your self is leaving.
Okay.
So when you give your
teaching, you can tell...
because you have the answer inside.
- I am your student, okay?
- Okay.
You are to eat a good diet...
without too much starch and too much fats.
And do not take any bad
things to enter your body,
as in drinking or food.
And some... There is
some temptation in my life.
Yes. Stay away from the people
that don't care about you,
that don't love you...
and only be with the people
that do love you.
Kumaré is a real-life person,
and he's always true and real.
And in his teachings, he's here to
help people, and you can feel that.
You can feel he's a good person.
It's nice to be around good people.
Tomorrow is an interesting
and important day.
Tomorrow is the great unveiling.
Today we are focusing on enactment.
It's all about bringing our
practice into the world today.
So it's not just about ourselves anymore.
We've done a lot of
visualization... going inside.
Now it's all about going outside...
and seeing how we're going to apply...
the best in ourselves to the world.
So I need help with today...
just clearing out this stuff.

Everybody come back, please.
Here. Here.
And whole place look complete different.
With only 15 people in one hour do that.
One man do will take one week.
Not 15 hours. One week. Yes?
So before you look outside for guru,
then you look yourself,
and you have everyone else.
Because after tomorrow,
I will not be here.
The only way
to complete the mirror teaching...
would be to unveil my true identity.
But I was struggling
to find the right words.
Would they understand
what I was trying to teach them?
Or would they hate me?
I went to visit my friend John
Rogers at his New Age bookstore...
for some inspiration.
Is not all this one like a religious symbol
for people... all this one you are selling?
Some are symbols and some are tools.
Like the crystals you see are tools.
- Okay.
- You follow?
How is it different?
A symbol is only meaning.
But a tool does stuff.
Do you believe that it is
doing or your mind is doing?
Depends on what it is.
Because then symbol also can be tool, yes?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Buddha, I believe Buddha said...
at least he's said to have said,
"If you see Buddha on the road, kill him."
Why do you think he said that?
Because you're not supposed
to believe or worship things.
And if you're worshipping a man,
you've missed it.
And I know he'd want us to
begin to come and find our spots.
Today's the unveiling.
I am not who you think that I am.
My name is Vikram,
and I am from New Jersey.
I am not who you think that I am.
Place this over your head...
just to create
an external sense of discipline.
Ritual creates discipline as well.
It makes us take something seriously.
I am not who you think I am.
Know that it's your inner teacher...
that is doing the watching
and the greeting...
and the smiling.
Look into the person's eyes.
Take a deep breath.
Get set.
Go.
I'm becoming...
the blue light.
Who are you becoming?
I'm becoming a guru.
Greg, what action would it take?
I will believe that I can
become my imagination.
I am not who you think I am.
I am a big liar.
I have fooled you to
make you feel like an idiot.
Sit anywhere you want
as long as you can see.
Okay, so, everybody, we're ready to start.
Guruji will be coming out shortly.
And before we start,
I think somebody would love
to lead you all in just a brief...
U-wa-é. Since we haven't done it yet today.

Today is the unveiling.
At the unveiling,
we... unveil our true self.
And to begin, I will...
reveal my true self.
You see, I don't know...
if I am who you think that I am.
You see,
I am not who you think that I am.
But I am only just a very simple man...
who had a idea,
a dream to...
show every person that I meet...
that they have some power
for self-transformation...
for happiness inside.
You are all great beings.
And you must stop pretending
that you are not.
So today, you will unveil
the guru inside of you.
I've learned that there
is fearlessness in all of us.
I know what I need to do. I
just need to keep my promises...
and to be strong against my temptations.
It's time to get rid of that old
identity and embrace the new.
I should do, uh... do less
talking and do more doing.
I'll make the promise, and I'll do what
I've promised to do: to change my life.
Everything is about commitment...
to one's self and to others.
More love and joy comes to you when
you have decided not listening to others...
but inside of yourself... your purpose.
The world will become very loud...
when you leave this circle
that we have created.
All of you live inside my heart...
forever.
I could not unveil.
As I stood in that circle
holding everyone's hands,
I realized I had connected more
deeply with people as Kumaré...
than I ever had as Vikram.
The experience with Kumaré
has affected my life,
and I feel like it has changed my teaching.
It's given me the same thing that
the students feel... that confidence.
And so being part of a lineage
and having the blessing of Kumaré...
has been very helpful.
I will always remember Kumaré.
I will remember him from the day I die.
I will tell my kids, my
grandkids, my great-grandkids...
about this wonderful person that
came into my life and changed me.
I'm completely in love with him.
He basically reflects
this love that I have.
And he reflects it to me in this way...
that's like the most love
I've ever experienced.
Every day when I meditate,
because I do meditate every day now...
That's on my list.
The five things I have to do.
Um, I... I thank Kumaré.
It's not familial.
It's not...
It's not like we've been through
any difficult times together.
It's just... There's this... attachment.
And-And... That's-That's that love.
I wear this. I feel very good...
because it remind me...
yeah, it remind me...
I should be like this and like that.
No anger, nothing.
Just be the guru who I am.
I'm imagining a blue light.
Blue... light.
Using the Blue Light meditation
will help people...
to find their own guru within.
Practice yoga at least
three times a week... yes.
Work out elliptical two times
a week... yes. I'm doing that.
And I also do weight training
'cause I stuck that in there.
All total from September,
I've lost 70 pounds.
This is the dress
that I couldn't wear previously.
Not bad, huh?
I'm planning on getting my yoga
instructor certification this next semester,
which I've wanted to do for years
and I've never had the courage to do it...
'cause I'm, like, "Oh, what will
people think of me?" Or this or that.
So I decided... I'm doing it.
Every day if there's some
little thing I can do, I will do it.
And I just have to make it a
point to keep it in my head...
that today's the day that I'm
gonna do something for my wife.
That gives me tears,
'cause... 'cause I never
used to be this way.
He says he doesn't teach anything.
But that's not true.
'Cause if you can teach
someone how to think,
then you really are...
you're a true teacher.
Hello, Bobby.
I return your call to Teresa.
Yes, hello, Kimberly.
Hello, Rachel. This is Kumaré.
So what do believe that you should do?
I did not say anything.
I say nothing you do.
But all this you did yourself.
I am only a strange man who
come to visit for one small time.
I also think about you very much.
Yes. I think about you
and all that has happened...
all the students... so much.
I was telling Riad... I'm, like, "I
think that he's in our life forever."
- That's how we feel.
- Uh-huh.
He's not necessarily a father
figure to me, but I look up to him.
Like, he knows more than me.
I just see him as a guy,
and for that, I am truly grateful.
Hello, gurus.
By now you must understand my teaching.
That the external guru is an illusion.
That he only exists...
to help you find the truth.
That the guru is inside of you.
In many ways I am the same as you.
I was born here in the U.S.A.
and grew up in New Jersey.
I am a U.S. citizen.
But how do these effects
define my true self?
They don't.
But something inside me does.
As a young man, very quickly,
I realized that my identity
was an illusion.
My curiosity brought me
to meet many swamis...
and priests and sects and gurus.
But none of them would say
one thing that I truly believed...
that you don't need them.
You don't need anyone outside
yourself to make you happy.
So I said, if I were to become a guru,
that I would teach this one thing...
that the guru you are
looking for is inside of you.
So this is the basis
of the Kumaré teaching...
a teaching that I created.
I am the first Kumaré, but
I hope that I am not the last.
In each of you, there is a guru inside...
that I can see.
It has given me strength.
It has given me purpose.
This is a teaching I believe in
with all my heart...
and every cell of my body.
So now I would like to introduce
you to the guru inside of me.
Hello, gurus.
My name is Vikram...
and my ideal self is Kumaré.
I had no idea. No idea.
And it's like the perfect
end of the teaching.
It is the ultimate of the teaching.
- I'm so hysterical.
- Good. Thank you.
- You missed a spot.
- I know.
I haven't shaved in a while.
Good job.
I got to say it was really...
I think it was a good idea.
You do have some psychic abilities.
