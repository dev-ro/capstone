- The worst tragedies
in human history
occurred when we
faced something unknown,
frightening.
- Today we are going
to witness
a unique astronomical
phenomenon.
- An unidentified flying object
was detected.
- 477, at ten o'clock.
- Roger that. I have a visual.
- No pressure,
but it's going to be
another fifty years
till a meteor shower
hits again.
- It's big, 650.
I have a visual.
- The object entered the
atmosphere from the west.
It has moved further north.
- People are watching
the meteor shower.
- Sveta is all alone up there.
- 477, repeat!
- It's huge!
- Humans waited
thousands of years
to make contact with an
extraterrestrial intelligence.
- Disaster in Moscow's
Chertanovo residential area.
An unidentified object crashed
into several apartment
buildings.
The death toll has yet
to be confirmed.
Experts are still reluctant
to confirm eyewitness accounts
that the incident was an alien invasion.
Nevertheless...
- This means war, right?
- It depends on
what they do next.
- Who are "they"?
- We can't just sit and wait
after what they've done.
- They are to blame.
Otherwise Sveta
would still be alive.
- Leave it! Yulia!
- What do you mean?
- Left!
Yulia!
- Don't be afraid.
- We don't know
what they are going to do.
Right now our main task is
to avoid a direct conflict.
- This is a unique opportunity
for humanity.
- He saved me.
I owe him.
- It's a chance to find out
more about ourselves.
To know who we are.
- I always knew
you were special.
- Transfer complete.
- This is a transmitter of kinetic material.
You will never be able to remove it.
- Got it.
- We are not allowed
to make contact.
We can't let you
get hold of our technology.
- Gratitude.
Loneliness.
Love.
- Love and hate help you
fight the fear of death.
Without death there is no need
for love or hate.
- You love him, right?
- I do.
- You dumped me
because of him.
- They're not what we thought!
They're better than us!
- This is our Earth!
- If you come close,
it will all be over.
Sol will blow up
the spacecraft.
- We will all die.
You and us. Understand?
- What are you doing with her?
[yelling]
[gun shots]
- I love you.
- Yulia!
- What are you doing

- Hakon could have
lived forever,
but he gave up his life
for her.
Now I have to review
the results of the mission.
They will affect
the future of our worlds.
- People say they can't go on
living like this.
And me?
No way.
- Azimuth adjustment.
Five degrees right.
- Roger that.
- Sustainer engine, stop.
- Roger.
- 314,
you are on the calculated flight path now.
- Check.
- Positive.
- The country's leading
research institutes
are decoding the technologies
left by the aliens.
Scientists are expecting
a breakthrough any time now,
potentially leading to advances
not only in military capability,
but also providing us
with advanced tools
in such diverse
fields as medicine,
energy production
and ship building.
- The country's leading
research institutes
are carefully working
on decoding the tech...
- Despite UN recommendations,
Russia has refused
to let foreign experts
examine the site.
This was the impetus
for the extension
of economic sanctions
against Russia.
[speaking foreign languages]
In an attempt to avoid
making the same mistakes again,
a special unit
has been created
to monitor so-called
"deep space."
Russian Aerospace Forces
have dedicated
satellites to support this.
The newly appointed Head
of the Extraterrestrial
Threat Prevention Unit
is the deputy commander of
the Russian Aerospace Forces,
Lieutenant General Valentin
Lebedev.
During the Shanghai Summit,
a fundamental decision was made
to allow countries
to destroy alien objects
which could potentially
threaten Planet Earth.
Those countries capable
of attacking
an enemy in outer space,
namely Russia,
the United States and China,
adopted the required
response protocols.
Details of the events in Moscow
two years ago are still murky,
but government agencies
assure the public
that efforts are being made
to guarantee that no spacecraft
will ever be able to arrive
at our planet unnoticed again.

Chara, where are you?
- Essentially there is almost
no difference
between human
and artificial intelligence.
With the exception,
of course,
of our individual
empathetic abilities,
which we deem
our personality.
And when we claim,
"I feel something,"
what we mean in reality is
we're aware
of a potential solution
without grasping
the algorithm
that leads us
to the solution.
But here's the thing:
We don't have to understand
everything.
- Any news from the lab?
Make any headway yet?
- That is classified
information.
If I tell you, then my guards
are going to have to shoot you.
- Intuition is not a miracle.
It is a carefully planned
strategy.
Vitalik here is quite lucky
because there are many things
he doesn't understand.
- Why'd you call him Vitalik?
- We would have maybe honored you,
Maxim,
if you'd demonstrated a bit
more vitality in the seminars
and by age 19
had invented Ethereum.
[students laughing]
Excellent.
Thank you, Vitalik.
[students gasp]
I know what you are thinking
about me right now.
- Chara would've bit his
leg off for that.
- I hope you find Chara.
- Vitalik has been programmed
to believe that
any physical contact
is a sign of approval,
whether you pet him
or hit him.
This is what we call
"limited perception."
Let me repeat.
No artificial intelligence
can surpass human intelligence
because we are the perfect
artificial intelligence.
For now.
They are our future.
However,
unlike us they will be almost immortal.
It is very likely that
they will even grow
to be emotional
because emotions are
inevitable after-effects
due to the complexity
of the system.
We should however
be able to
nullify their unwanted emotions
through certain protocols.
- How about us?
- What about us?
- Can you nullify
our unwanted emotions?
So we'll wag our tails
even though we just got
hit in the face?
- Theoretically, yes.
By stimulating or inhibiting
certain parts of the brain.
Don't fool yourself, Yulia.
The truth is we're not that
much different from them.
Okay.
Soon enough
the machines will learn
to feel sympathy
and aversion,
hatred and love.
- We need love and hate
to save us from
the fear of death.
If you're immortal,
then why love somebody?
[school bell ringing]
- Jeez,
don't they get on your nerves?
- Who?
- Them.

- That was my daughter!
Who gave the order to attack?
What's going on?
- Easy, Valentin.
Sit down.
Sit down, General Lebedev!
Who is here
from the Aerospace Forces?
Who gave the order
to the pilots?
- I did.
- Who ordered a missile launch
in the center of Moscow?
- You did, comrade general.
- I ordered you to shoot
at my own daughter?
- We can retrieve
the recording.
It was given via
an internal channel.
- Do it right now!
- Krylov,
send two K-52 choppers
to the Moskvoretskaya
embankment.
Right away.
The target is underwater.
Shoot to destroy.
- Downtown, comrade general?
- Copy that.
- Do I have to repeat myself?
- No, sir. I'll give the order.
- You need to take a look
at the news.
- Put the news
up on the big screens.
To recap,
Yulia Lebedeva is wanted
on suspicion
of a terror attack.
She may be responsible
for bombing
a Moscow apartment block.
The final death toll
is still unknown.
At the moment,
24 people have been declared dead.
We have received a video
which one could call
"The Lebedev Manifesto."
We believe it was made
right after
or just before the bombing.
- Can you hear me?
Then pay attention.
Three years ago,
a UFO crashed in Chertanovo.
You claimed it was
an alien act of aggression.
That is a lie.
We attacked them.
And then I was treated
like a lab rat.
My father personally
led the tests.
I demand that all
classified information
sealed by the Ministry
of Defense
be made public.
The military stole
alien technologies
and has used them to
secretly develop new weapons.
I know you think that
no one can stop you.
That is not true.
- Now what?
- She desperately needs
pure water.
Go and get some.
- Water?
- Yes.
Go to the store,
grab some bottles
and give money
to the cashier.
- Look,
I know how shopping works.
You spent three years
away from society.
You may have lost
some skills.
- You go to the store.
- No. You go to the store.
- [Yulia] Can one of you go
or else I'll have to do it.
- You are the only one
not on the wanted list.
Got any cash?
- I have a job...
- [Yulia] Just go!
I thought you would understand
how dangerous it was.
To no avail.
Now I will do whatever
it takes to...
[Yulia] Is war the only
language you speak?
Excellent.
Then war it is.
Be ready
for more explosions.
This earth is no longer
solely yours.
- The question remains:
Why was the public
not told earlier
that the young woman
not only had contact
with the alien
but also received
an object from him.
Its purpose still remains
unknown.
- Where is the broadcast
coming from?
- From you. You're live.
- We're not on the air!
Mute the audio!
- What's wrong?
Who's on the air?
- ...Ministry of Defense.
No real progress
has been made...
- My, my!
- The broadcast center is being bypassed.
It's all over the Internet, too.
- What's going on?
- Is it a cyber attack?
- Unfortunately not.
At least not from this planet.
- Not from this planet?
Do you mean to say that...
- If it is within our means
to locate the intruder,
we will find him.
And retaliate according
to our defense protocols.
- Before I initiate
any protocols,
I'll need evidence.
Rock-solid, consistent,
indisputable facts.
- We'll get the facts.
But first...
We must disarm them.
No more cell phones.
No digital technology.
We have to put analog services
back in operation.
We use nothing
but landline phones
and couriers.
I agree. Go ahead!

Which Yulia?
What apartment block?
- A terror attack?
Are you okay?
- The incident is interesting.
Yulia Lebedeva is wanted
on suspicion of extremism.
- Zora, are these your friends
doing this on the screen now?
- My parents said
it was up to me.
I've made up my mind.
I want to do cybersport.
- An excellent decision.
Especially if you compare it to
studying math or physics.
Cybersport is the in-thing
right now.
But your top priority now
is to locate Yulia Lebedeva,
who is charged with
several crimes.
- Yes, it's okay.
- Mom, are you calling me?
- I'm talking with your dad.
Who is Yulia?
Why are you telling me?
[cellphones ringing]
- Yulia Lebedeva is
still on the wanted list.
Any information of her
whereabouts...
- Attention all units.
APB on Yulia Lebedeva.
Last seen...
- Why so much water?
- Water is the basis of life.
- An ID is the basis of life.
Got one?
- No ID.
- Where are you from?
- From here.
I live in Kushelevo.
- What is your full address?
- My full address is
Virgo Supercluster, Local Group,

- Roma,

- Lena, listen to me.
If you see her,
call me right away.
- I'm listening but what have
we got to do with any of this?
I thought you were
coming home earlier
to spend time with Roma.
He has a concussion.
We're in hospital.
I'll put him on.
- Hey, Dad.
- Roma!
- Did you watch the news?
That's Yulia Lebedeva.
She's all over the internet,

- Roma, what...
- She blew up our house.
- Why... How are you?
- I can't talk now.
The doctor is here.

by EMERCOM
which you can call to find out
if anyone in your family is,
God forbid,
one of the victims.

MOSCOW IS LOOKING FOR
YULIA LEVEDEVA
DO YOU KNOW YULIA LEVEDEVA?
[doorbell ringing]
- [exhales sharply]
- Local Police Officer,
Senior Lieutenant Fillipov.
- Hello.
- Hello.
A classmate of yours?
- Yes.
- Where and when
was the last time you saw her?
- At university.
- Who's at the door?
You're here!
I've been waiting for you
for two years.
When are you going to shut down
the disco on the ground floor?
- We will look into the matter.
- Please, do.
- Let me know if you hear
anything about your friend.
- We will.
We certainly will.
- Grandma,
what are you doing?
Have a rest.
- How can I rest?
Either I'm all alone,
or it's Grand Central Station here.
Where did you hide
your friends?
- Hello.
My name is Hariton.
- So, is it helping?
- Yes, she'll survive.
But she is no longer
one of you.
[water trickling]
The pain is changing her.
She's getting stronger
because of it.
But the force that's growing
inside of her
could become a risk
for us all.
- Is that why Ra
wants to kill her?
- Ra is an artificial
intelligence.
It does not want anything.
It analyzes event probabilities
and follows a defense protocol.
- A protocol?
- A mathematical one.
One death is better
than multiple deaths.
[bell dings]
- All law enforcement agencies
continue to search
for Yulia Lebedeva.
Authorities are doing
their best...
- What did she do?
- Nothing much.
- They're false accusations.
- I see.
Is she a political activist?
- Something like that.
- What about you?
- He's not from around here.
- I have a job, a house and...
- He's trying to get her out...
of the country.
And I'm just helping a bit.
- That'll get you eight years
in prison.
We can share a cell.
- Is he also...
- No, he is...
- I am the only one here
to suffer for no reason.
Nothing but stress since then.
You have anything
to whet my palate?
- Let me see.
- What's the deal with her?
Will she rat on us?
- Let's drink to our meeting.
Here you are.
- So, your people...
Can't they just strike us
with a death ray?
- You have something like that, right?
- Even you don't do that.
There are more effective
methods.
- We've got missiles, too.
And we can strike back.
- Oh yes, we can!
- That is a bad option and
could aggravate the situation.
- So the idea
of annihilation is bad.
But hiding for the rest
of one's life...
Is a good one?
- I will not do anything
that could hurt her.
- Me neither.
- To love!
To love!
- To love.
[glasses clink]
- How was that?
You okay?
So you think
we should hide in the woods
for the rest of our lives?
- We have no other choice.
This stuff inhibits
your reflexes
and impedes vital functions.
- That's the point.
So let's drink!
To the intergalactic union.
- Firstly,
I'm from the same galaxy.
What's more,
there is no connection
between drinking alcohol
and the probability
of the realization
of the words you just
spoke aloud.
- Smartass!
This is just...
Tradition.

Now a chaser!
- [gulping]

- It's even better.

You have no choice.
Or you will go to jail...
as an accomplice.
It's either him...
Or us.
What planet
are you fighting for?
- He's heavy.
- Make an effort.
No one will believe us
if we don't bring
the alien in alive.
Put your hat on his head!
Are you free, boss?
- In a minute.
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.
- Hi there.
- Are you guys partying?
- Our friend here is going
to serve in the army.
"Spade and gun
make a soldier's life fun."
Where do you want to go?
- Ministry of Defense.
- What branch
will he be joining?
- The Aerospace Forces.
- Don't shoot.
It's pointless.
- Shut up.
- You do, you don't.
They make you.
It's not that bad.
You get to know life,
breathing in gunpowder.
- I am Sergei Brilyov.
You are watching
Vesti breaking news.
At the moment we
are broadcasting live
via the EMERCOM
mobile stations.
We are in the midst
of truly inexplicable acts
of enemy sabotage.
We don't know details yet,
but we are under attack.
The enemy has taken control
of all digital communication
channels.
Be prudent.
Trust only information that
comes directly from the police,
military officials,
and/or members of EMERCOM.
Avoid using modern
telecommunications
when talking to family
or friends.
And above all:
Do not react to any
provocations.

- In a safe place.
I will have you shot

No judge, no trial.
- She's at my place.
- Google, you idiot.
- What's going on
with the internet and TV?
Was that your lot?
- Ra is after Yulia.
It decided to kill her
in order to keep peace.
- Keep peace... Nazi style.
- And I am going to
destroy this Ra of yours!
Where is it?
Where? In orbit?
- You don't stand a chance.
You don't know
what it's capable of.
- We didn't start this,
we're following
our defense protocol.
- Ra thinks the same way.
- Get these two out of here.
Hariton.
Help me.

Make your choice now.

Your world?

- If this thing
really has the entire

under control,
including NATO missile unit

and we want to destroy it,
then we have to assume
it will intercept our missiles.
- Our plan is to briefly disable
the satellites it controls.
- How will you do that?
- Right now,
all satellites are linked together.
If we take out one of them,
control will be lost

Civilized.

It is due to people like you

There are too many risks,

Shooting is the last option

He's in a hospital,

But if I find out

Hariton.
If you're worried
about our future,
then I need to
inform you that...

a house, and a vegetable garden.
Considering that your death
is also highly probable...
I grant you permission.
Careful!
