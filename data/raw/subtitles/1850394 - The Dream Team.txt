10 YEARS LATER
- You are directly in four minutes.
- Thin enough.
You call this a big showdown?
The best players are abroad.
The other is some mountain goats.
They graze just on the pitch. And not
pitch for those with big balls.
Your father is drunk again, baby.
- Joël Fuchs, former judge...
- Do not! Get me an ashtray.
- It was a common challenge.
- There was criminal!
- I have never ever filmed!
- Not again. It is 10 years ago.
You were expelled
and missed the final.
But it was not the worst.
The worst thing was that instead of
to be with the team -
- I went in town
and met my wife.
Son of a bitch!
- Your red card...
- Sit, Patrick.
- It destroyed my life.
- Because your wife faker in bed?
- Get the guards!
- The red card!
Beautiful, boys! I'm proud of you.
The entire island.
We've played us to
seventh round of the Coupe de France.
It's a miracle!
- What about a bonus, Mr President?
- A bonus? Why is that?
Because we qualified.
Cheers to Brittany!
- What can you use a bonus here?
- He says something.
- Rent.
- Electric and gas.
- My car loan!
- Nénene, 13 beers on my tab.
Mr President!
The program attacks the previous
top player Orbéra judge...
Money increases them to the head.
You're right, Titouan.
Do not give baboons too much.
What?
What is he saying?
He is in his office,
Mr. Mayor.
- Oh god!
- Cleaning lady found him.
This was lying on his table.
Is cannery
under management?
- How much does it take to save it?
- 600,000 euros.
We're done.
- We have to win this year's Tom Thumb-cup.
- Continue Le Pen.
Every year doing one amateur teams must.
Remember Calais, Carquefou and Chambery.
We play us ahead and play against
a first division team in Brest -
- in front of 15,000 spectators.
It gives the box.
So we must handle two rounds.
There must be a miracle.
They still have no fixed abode.
How do you sleep, Mr Orbéra?
After the evening's program: the cell.
- At the hotel or with friends.
- If someone pick him up.
I would argue that Mr Orbéra just
been dismissed from the TV show.
For unsportsmanlike behavior.
How could I
meet your request?
I just want to be allowed to
to see my daughter.
- I want to improve myself.
- I certainly hope so.
But I do not have proof.
An employment contract.
A house with a room for Louise.
And first and foremost
must of alcoholism.
Until these requirements are met,
lose the custody.
- Are you so happy?
- Yes, very much.
You stink like a whole barrel of booze.
- Why is Louise here?
- Imelda go to stores with her.
- Father!
- Hello, sweetheart.
- It's just make-up.
- Have I ruined your life, Dad?
You?
- You are the best thing in my life.
- Mr Orbéra?
The very best.
- I'll see.
- Mr Orbéra?
I have something for you.
A trænerjob in a small club.
Is there anyone who will hire me?
Where?
Molene.
A small Breton island.
So I'm all the way down to touch the bottom.
Do I have a choice?
What a hole in the ground.
I am Titouan Leguennec.
Jump into.
- Do you know what the pay is?
- Yes, the minimum wage.
What is it in these days?
3,000?
- 1,321. Gross.
- So much...
I can only pay you this month.
The club is in trouble.
Unless...
Do you know the story of Tom Thumb?
Hello, everyone.
I'd be interested to look at, but I
will be alone with the team now. Thank you.
- We are team.
- Can not you see it?
- Do we have a chance?
- None.
And the pitch slopes.
How did you get to the seventh round?
Held.
It's a nightmare.
I have contacted
a Romanian striker.
I wait for him to call back.
- Is this your wife?
- No, my daughter and my grandson.
If you try something, do
swim all the way to the mainland.
Hello. My name is Anne.
Welcome to Molene.
This is my grandfather's ship.
A tunbåd built in 1924.
Is not she beautiful?
Is this Alcatraz, or what?
So you can not take into
and get drunk.
- What are you doing?
- I'll take you in treatment.
- Do you know anything about alcoholism?
- No. I'm from Brittany.
- Have I ruined your life, Dad?
- What a hole in the ground.
Until these requirements are met,
lose custody.
Have I ruined your life, Dad?
Sorry.
I would just shut you out.
- It's the stupid.
- I had no plans to go.
Are you okay?
I just have a
small... panic attacks.
When my husband was at sea,
I sat here -
- and the stars
to calm down.
- Where is your husband?
- He's disappeared. At sea.
The sea is rough. Therefore put
sailors relied on stars.
Did I forget to lock?
Get up! It's seven o'clock.
The Romanian has sent a picture.
- And?
- He has only one leg.
I've thought about it.
One player does not help.
We must strengthen the whole team.
- I'm no Rockefeller.
- I dare not promise anything.
But I have an idea.
Have you seen Marandella?
Where is Marandella?
Have you seen Marandella?
- Marandella!
- Orbéra!
It's over ten years ago!
- I'm on my ass.
- It's not why I'm here.
You know I get seasick.
And then you drag me to an island?
- Join us in the Jacuzzi.
- You must give up Coke and whores.
- I'm not a whore, but escort.
- Dickhead.
Marandella, you have completely forgotten
the organized struggle?
And the two kilograms pot in Amsterdam?
- Okay, I understand!
- Have you forgotten that I saved your life?
Forgot it?
Do you remember, I saved your life?
How could I know
she was underage?
She told me she was 32
- It's me who is the victim here.
- Honor...
I defended you both in court,
to the union and to your mother.
You stood for five years.
Give me three months.
Listen. I finished my career
at Boca Juniors in Argentina.
It should be remembered as my last club.
Not a bunch Breton miners.
It's football socialism.
We attacking football capitalists.
Do it because you owe me.
And do it for the people.
I've always hated to be on target.
Then I play center forward.
Only center forward.
How bullshit.
Center forward.
It all started
when I came to Milan.
Every time I scored,
put the other one on me.
Top of you?
When scores,
run they going to crush one.
No, Mr Ziani, not again. It is
just the way they express enthusiasm.
I was afraid of being suffocated.
I stopped to score.
Berlusconi hated me.
Do you know what he called me?
Zidantetanten.
Sooner or later, you realize
that you were a great player.
Scares death you?
You get no warning.
The beats just for.
As mosquitoes that swarm about you.
The think all is well,
but then suddenly...
Mr Ziani,
as time has passed for today.
Already? Can I come tomorrow?
- Only if you are sick.
- I do not feel good.
I cages me up with Mother
and play PlayStation all day long.
They have deleted my player in FIFA.
I is not even virtual more!
Mr Ziani,
Now you must come to their senses.
Rayane. Your mom said I could
find you here. You look great.
It's just...
It's complicated.
How are you? I have gone down
the flag. Have you heard of FIFA?
You should not connect a failure.
I have a club for you.
Is there a club that will have me?
Juve? Barca?
No, Molene in Brittany.
- UK?
- No, Brittany.
They want you and no one else.
They are your biggest fans.
My biggest fans?
- Do I need vaccinations?
- No.
- Hello, sir N'dogo.
- Hello.
Scrabble on Thursday?
My wife makes the pie.
- Decorated with a chocolate football.
- I'd be happy to.
- You enjoy retired life, huh?
- Orbéra!
Here is quiet.
Neighbors die like flies.
I go and cut the lawn.
- Weke N'dogo! Will you come here?!
- I'm coming, baby.
Team does not have a chance,
but you can defend them.
- Fatou kill me.
- Does it not okay with the heart?
The risk of a blood clot is 1:500,
then everything is fine.
- Get your feet up of the cold water!
- It's 32 degrees.
- I say it's cold.
- It's a bit chilly.
I need you, weke.
Drop it. Children must
not even play football.
Come out of the pool!
Fatou what if I took your husband on
a spa by the sea in Brittany?
- He's become a little flabby, right?
- It struck me immediately.
Three or four weeks at the very best
spa with the best doctors -
- and he is 15 years younger.
- In Brittany?
- Yes, with fresh sea air.
- No football?
- No. Only oysters.
It is good for the heart.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I've just been there myself.
- So I get my young love again?
- May I?
After ten years in power, you damn
not teach me to wipe my ass.
- As written for me.
- Just do not page 32 Remember that.
- Sit here, Mr Reno.
- Thank you.
- David Leandri.
- Yes.
You are a great football player.
Can I have your autograph for my niece?
Yes, but... I am no longer
footballer. I'm an actor.
I write an autograph,
but it is a little odd -
- such from an actor
to another.
- So it's you, Mr Leandri.
- I'm coming.
Tight lines.
Now no Panenka-kick, Leandri.
There are two more minutes. Imagine
you the pressure is on him now.
- If he misses, the Madrid home.
- He wants to bet on a strong kick.
Enough with the inside of the foot.
A Panenka-kick! Why?
Do you want some water?
No, I was just thinking about
where I put the car.
After ten years in power, you damn
not teach me to wipe my ass.
Calm down, Gus.
- Pablo is the director.
- I'll take it.
I leave,
as if I answer the phone.
Pablo? I'm busy.
But good to hear your voice.
I will hold you
and feel your lips on my...
- Drawing the lines?
- No, no, not at all.
But why is he gay?
Is this a problem?
Why does it have to be me,
is the gun?
The station will like.
Love scene with Pablo on page 32
is a little too modern for me.
Can not we change tactics?
When I played for Bayern,
we lost three games in a row.
Coach moved left-winger
and pulled backen up.
We won both the cup and the championship.
So we just change my character.
Gus cubes Anita and Jean-Pierre
giving it to Pablo. What say you?
NAR
They will call back.
It's a good sign. Orbéra!
I need you in my attack.
I play with the brain.
As an actor.
- I need you for three months.
- Everybody wants me.
Excuse me.
Call my agent! Door.
Pis.
"After a wild spree in Manchester -
- sent Shaheef Berda
three guys in the hospital."
You should be back in two days.
At six o'clock in the morning. Exactly.
Orbéra...
- What the hell are you doing in Manchester?
- I need a defense.
- In France.
- Fuck France! I am English now.
- You're as French as camembert.
- I do not understand you.
- What gives?
- 1,000 euros.
- In an hour?
- About months.
- Fuck you.
- Let me explain.
"Fuck you" means
call is finished.
Berda!
It's fucking Shaheef Berda!
He ​​is brilliant!
Stop the car.
- He still has good legs.
- Shut up!
- Give me three months.
- Fuck you! Close up!
- Yesterday you saw the team?
- They're gonna kill me!
Are you on the team?
Are you coming to France?
- Okay, asshole.
- Run!
Come back!
It's not smart
with the two on the same team.
Marandella busted once
Berdas lady. He hates him.
So here we are.
Show you from your best side!
Here they come!
This is it.
WELCOME TO moles
- Marandella fixed the time a fight.
- N'dogo is in good shape.
- Had he not bad heart?
- Berda, the Red Baron!
- Where does the nickname come from?
- He holds the record for red cards.
Ziani on Molene.
I can not believe my eyes.
Welcome, everyone.
Thank you will help us
and support the team and our island!
Great welcome.
Canning factory only chance
for survival is in your hands.
The whole village celebrates you.
Ziani, you are our savior!
Let me get my sled.
A sausage from Molene, Mr Ziani?
Here's your room.
I may even benefit beds.
- It's like a training camp.
- Does not PlayStation?
- What is a plejstation?
- It will be like a vacation.
Shithole.
- Is there no coverage?
- The right phone is downstairs.
Take it easy.
Look, there's a game on it here.
Here is a game for you.
Do you have wifi?
I believe
you are connected here on the island?
Yes, there is good water pressure.
Hot... and cold.
Shit!
I drove a fucking seagull down!
The entire island around a minute
50 seconds! You call it an island?
- Are you the President?
- Yes.
- Expenses.
- Chips? Does he think I'm an idiot?
Nice and easy. Do not press too hard on
. I'll just have the habit again.
Breathe!
Stop taking pictures!
- I'm not fucking fit.
- Two lanes!
What kind of track?
Then use the abs!
It's not abs,
it's puddings.
Ni... ten. Five to.
- Hang in.
- what?
- You hate enough blacks on the team.
- Why?
- You called Le Pen.
- It's an abbreviation.
Forli Penis.
- Take it easy, weke.
- This island is getting on my nerves.
- My heart rate is at 135 It's fine.
- Okay, fine.
Up the pace, guys!
Shut up, it was good!
Now I will not stop!
- They're too old.
- It's "Rocky 9".
Le Pen, do not look at!
Are on hold together!
Shit!
What the hell was that, Debec?
Well done.
A great Scottish attack.
- Thank you, Berda.
- What is this shit?
What kind of bullshit? Just keep.
Otherwise you end up like Ziani.
- Look at the spade. No balls.
- You're an asshole!
- Can you see this?
- Hand of God?
- We play game tomorrow!
- Better jail than rat bastards.
Who's a dickhead?
- I want to Paris now.
- Great idea, guys.
- Fuck they breathed Bretons.
- You too!
We do not give up now.
I ask you to be.
I have to play for the island.
Look at me.
Everyone knows I'm an alcoholic.
I have lost my honor
and my credibility.
But we all had the same dream
about the game. About to play football.
Ziani,
what did you dream about as a kid?
And what about you, Marandella?
And you Berda?
Did you more on cars?
And ye shall hold your head up!
This island is your future.
Support us with honor.
We all have something to hold onto...
Or recyclable.
There is a long way to go. But what we
risk losing on the field, -
- we gain in self-respect.
And that's priceless.
Victory is our tomorrow!
- What kind of a sick logo?
- It is for the people. Come on!
I'd forgotten how good it feels.
What is that smell?
- Low tide?
- My happiness underpants.
Orbéra, for God's sake!
Open the window!
- Where is Berda?
- He washes car.
Remember what we practiced at training.
Two dense blocks.
And keeper...
He has fished all night.
Signs Marandella not a goal?
Zero. I am ready to stand on goal.
I am the white Samuel Eto'o. Goal!
- Are you as completely away from the window?
- It's a tactical move. Just wait.
I'm sorry to wake you,
but we have to play for five minutes.
It's not Liverpool,
but has fired up the audience.
You call this a career? I feel
me as Che in a workers' union.
- Get on your space.
- Drop the first half next time.
- There was a feather in the carburetor.
- Ro on, boys.
Bad luck,
when ten men go on the pitch.
What is it that stinks of death?
Come on, boys! As in 98!
Come home!
Pis.
- Holy shit!
- Close to.
- Why is he there?
- It's a tactical move.
Come on!
Push to him!
Cover him!
- Where did it go?
- Marandella!
- How a fool.
- Misses you every time?
Give me a chance.
There is a knoll on the pitch.
Fuck the tuber.
I have to put up with a score.
Dispose!
- Pull yourselves together now, dammit!
- Was the tuber, or what?
're In fucking bad shape.
We change tactics. Defensively game.
We run a full chain
and counterattack.
And send it over to...
Marandella.
- Do you have the disgust in his eyes?
- Coach?
- We lose?
- Rayane... The fight is not over.
Then we go on the field again!
- And your heart?
- I am fine.
Number 10 is the most dangerous. So no
insults, no knætacklinger.
Over on the other side!
Marandella, dammit!
- Where are your legs, gammelfar?
- Up your ass.
Come on, boys.
Games on both sides!
I found my legs.
- Red card? Think of your family.
- Watch now on, Berda.
Come on, boys! Two minutes left!
Above the pitch!
Come on, Le Pen!
This is our last chance.
- Get out of here.
- I did it just ready...
Slip.
- Then take it, you moron.
- Hurry up.
- Do you...?
- Shoot!
Come on, Ziani. Determine the match.
We got it!
No, not on me!
Come on, Molene!
- How is it with cheese and ham?
- Without cheese.
Celebrate victory with pancakes...
- No duller, Internet, discos.
- It's hard without my PlayStation.
- There is not even room service.
- I miss my games.
- Enough is enough!
- Rayane...
I have found
one plejstation for you.
Where was he happy!
That's my son. It was in the basement.
It's expired.
So there's a party!
I have not got a drop.
The rabbit says goodbye
to the turtle.
The rabbit goes into his stay
to sleep.
And the turtle withdraws into its shell.
It has a tiny bed in there.
Now you also need to close your gorgeous
eyes and dream sweet. Turn off the lights.
Turn off the lights, baby.
I love you too.
So Shut up!
- Should not we find some ladies?
- No, Fatou, do not come here.
I follow a carefully planned program.
I have to go now.
It's time for mud bath.
The mud.
We drop next match
and get some pussy in Paris.
- You're still a big fat jerk.
- Better a fool than cuckold.
Hello.
- Where is your hair nice.
- And you have a beautiful skin.
Is the tire a little flat? Try another
gear. It is not hard thighs.
I have to be honest.
Your players lack motivation.
Yes. They are accustomed to partying
and score ladies.
This is indeed a backwater.
- Is my daughter with them?
- Okay, now we have to intervene.
- What's your type?
- Those costs 3,000 euros. night.
- What do they do for 3,000 euros?
- You're the drunken footballer.
You were skidesej in the program.
I would like to slap my boss one.
I have a deal for you.
Do you want to work as a barmaid
with a sportier extra gig?
You say things straight.
Who is extra tjansen for?
All 11?
I'm not a football.
- Do not go to bed with them.
- I will never, gammelfar.
- What should I do?
- Seduce them.
Just keep them going,
until we have qualified us.
Hurry! We need to catch the ferry.
Get started! I'll see you sweat.
Coetdic are good.
A large bread took my skates,
when I was 8
He so ugly like Mitterrand.
Is not a psychologist?
Take a ball.
- Is Mitterrand not just common?
- The judge can not see it.
- But if I smash his knee?
- You just do it right.
Hi, Floria!
- What is it?
- It's Nénenes new barmaid.
You're right. One must confront
Heads, do not be suppressing.
So you stop it.
"Even the dead can not rest in peace
in an oppressed country."
- Fidel Castro.
- You must take to dry up the nose.
- Should I not train tomorrow?
- Jo.
Are not you in bed, Rayane?
I just wanted to play to the end.
Atari is too fat.
PlayStation does not have better players.
Have you seen how they run?
When they are happy, they do so.
When he yells at them,
he does so.
Can I play a little more?
I've thought about it. We need
your Leandri as striker.
And Marandella must at all costs
back in goal.
Leandri want to be an actor,
and Marandella is a stubborn bastard.
- Then come up with a plan.
- Yes, a plan...
- Is everyone ready?
- No trace of Berda and Marandella.
Then it's done. Two for each.
- Is there something strange?
- No. Do not worry about it.
Two each.
Marzine.
I prefer mazarin.
Marandella! We need to Brest
and make ladies!
- He threw a pizza in the sea.
- I die.
- This is serious with the seasickness.
- I'm going back.
- On one condition.
- What?
- You go back into the goal.
- I will not be back in the stadium!
- There are five more hours.
- Pis.
- He does not hold.
- Beware online.
That's it!
- It's good. Like sushi.
- I'm going back in goal.
I go back in goal,
but stop now.
Cyrano would not have
been happier with a new nose.
- Moliere is good.
- So it is Edmond Rostand.
Yes, Rostand.
There are many lines to learn.
- All the big plays Rostand.
- Not Tom Cruise.
Say yes. It provides integrity.
- Who is the director?
- Leguennec.
- What's the draw?
- We pulled Coetdic, but at home.
So what? We have quarantined
because an idiot threw a nødraket.
- It was not my fault!
- Here he comes.
David?
Incredible. What are you doing here?
The team that I told you about,
play here.
What a coincidence. Good day.
Edmond Rostand ?
Well, do not you? I must continue.
I will be picked up.
Ciao!
Leandri.
Leguennec. Good day.
I see in your eyes,
you may be the director.
I've read all about you on Wikipedia
and am proud to work for you.
Wikipedia?
Yes, a Breton theater director,
with the same name as me.
Cleverly.
You're almost a real manager.
"Aggressive: If I had such a
a nose, I'd cut it off."
"Friendly:
It must be dipped in your cup."
What is this hay?
Do we have to keep it?
It is not Cyrano but Pinocchio.
I'm sorry, it's for me.
Hello? Yes, honey.
I stand on stage right now.
Samples is tedious.
I do not understand it all.
But the poster is great. My name is
in larger letters than the play.
I'll call you, baby.
I love you.
How should reply comes?
Happy, sad, irritated, heartbroken?
- Heartbroken.
- I miss instruction! And...
Roxane supposed to be my cousin,
but she's older than me.
And also...
She is ugly.
Tell me, Foucher...
Where can I get some hair wax,
gives a wet look?
When you want the wet look here,
are waiting for rain.
Do you want to come over for dinner one evening?
I make a delicious roast.
Anne! We've got
letter from commercial law.
They seize engines
and boats.
True?
Are we all out of work?
I will not lie to you.
Bailiff coming soon.
- How crap.
- I'm 44
I've been 30 years in the factory,
what do I do now?
We are fishermen, not seagulls!
We fight and we win.
I have contacted the Minister
Prefect. We stand together.
- Should we take boats out?
- Of course.
If a bureaucrat from Brussels
will crush our balls -
- he must get our sardines
to taste. And swallow the can.
Is anybody here?
Plays Colleagues?
Roxane?
Leguennec.
It was just you, I would talk to.
Costume Samples
would help me a lot.
Should I play Cyrano in there?
I want you to play
center forward. Molene need you.
I am not a director, and all
actors are people from the island.
- Say that again.
- We do not crunch up.
We do not crunch up?
Are you out of your mind, Leguennec?
I'm not Leguennec.
- You are not Leguennec?
- Jo. But not the real.
You are a fake Leguennec?
Not my nose!
I invited everyone in Paris
to the premiere.
- Only the gulls come.
- I am 45 years. I'm an actor.
- Show me respect.
- Where is it hot!
- Who is she?
- Not now.
- I have no idea.
- Your trick is pitiful.
I agree to play football,
if we resume samples.
- We put the piece up. With the poster.
- Impossible.
- With the poster?
- With each!
- So there is no football.
- We put the piece up.
Otherwise Marandella in the attack!
I take my hat off and stripping me
slowly my coat and my sword...
Swordfish! I have a book on fishing.
- I take my hat off and...
- Shut the fuck up, James Dean!
It is used for armored fighting vehicles.
- James who?
- Not my hair!
You're not doing scissor kicks,
but salmon kick.
- Come on, boys.
- I do not between the posts.
Ambiance of Eric Tabarly Circuit -
- is Milan-Barcelona worthy.
It was my joke.
I am the only spectator, -
- after Molenes fans were expelled
to throw a nødraket on the pitch.
- Drop that!
- What are Marandella?
Leandri! In front of me!
- Shit. I was there otherwise.
- I am a striker. I shoot.
- Can we deliver to each other?
- Come home!
- I could have scored.
- Dispose, Marandella!
Wait till I get hold of you
out in the locker room!
Marandella, damn it!
- Give them beating.
- I'm center forward.
- You are on target.
- So do however in the stadium!
- Want to go for a walk?
- Into the target, your monkey!
Molene are behind 1-0
here after the first half.
Without their followers
looks bleak in the second half.
Orbéra must inspire his men.
- We have to give them a hand!
- He's right.
Forget your ego trip!
We play for them.
For Molene.
We must save the plant.
Mr Marandella?
- I'm Coetdics chairman.
- Super. And?
I have followed your career,
if you understand...
10,000 euros,
if you make sure that we win.
Not to offend you.
I can kiss my ass!
- Is it D-Day?
- There comes troops.
Molene! Molene!
- It is a violation.
- Not if they are on the water.
Proponents have infected the team with
their energy. Berda grabs the ball.
He plays the field to Leandri.
And a quick pass to Ziani.
And Molene scores!
A header in the top corner!
- Not my hair. Sorry.
- Leandri! Leandri!
A few minutes' playing time,
and it is still 1-1.
Molenes players going crazy.
Leandri keeps the ball -
- and walking alone towards the goal.
There are goals!
Other goals of Leandri!
- Watch now on my hair.
- 2-1 for Molene!
He is all alone.
Gone with the ball.
- Beautiful!
- Corner to Coetdic.
Red card for Debec.
And the penalty for Coetdic.
Coetdic can compensate now.
Son of a bitch!
- I have a gift for you.
- For me?
To the people.
What is happening?
Father's tunbåd!
- Are you drunk?
- I just need to fresh air.
They are great. Your breasts.
Tunbåden!
Leguennec! Hurry!
Come down to the canning factory!
Me can not be intimidated.
I closed Moulinex factory.
Factory is now sealed.
- What's happening?
- They put us out.
Canning factory
is no longer yours. Get out.
Away?
- I smash you all!
- And I'll take care of the rest.
Outstanding. I will return.
With gendarmes.
- Take just cops with too.
- Sissy!
- Get out.
- Come, we go.
- Sorry about last night. I was full.
- Yeah, I could see.
And Marseilles opponent
in the 16-part finale is Molene.
Marseille Molene in Brest.
Good luck to Thumbelina team.
What do you say? Marseille.
Another sardinby.
The killing us.
We are at odds 3,000
on the web.
We are simply Mini Tom Thumb.
- Micro Tom Thumb.
- Nano Tom Thumb.
I give a game!
- What is it that goes up to speed?
- No, he gives a game.
- Are you saying I go on playing?
- No.
- Who will?
- The beers are passed around.
Mission accomplished. I must have
a contract, so I have to see my daughter.
We came to the 16-part finale.
We are playing against Marseille in Brest.
Television rights cleared factory.
We are sadly lacking more money.
- We have to cope with another round.
- What?
Cast Marseille?
Do you have a brain under the cap?
And now an exclusive interview
with the new Molene team.
How do you look at the opponent?
We're playing the
the best first division team.
- Are you proud to be a goalie?
- I'm happy to be on target.
And to all French clubs out there:
I can also play center forward.
In any division.
- Marandella!
- I'll get my gloves.
- Or on a handball team.
- How are you training?
Cure has helped.
I have lost four kilograms.
I'm on a diet oyster.
Doctors say...
It's going well.
I rest me and lose me.
- As for the game...
- I can not run here.
You can not run at a spa.
- Are you afraid of Marseille?
- You may even be afraid. Get out!
Big clubs have contacted you.
Yes, Barcelona, ​​
but it is too far away.
And Bavaria.
But they were too late.
But now I work.
- And here you go.
- Your ambitions for the season...
Microphone closer.
It is so little too close.
I see the piece as halvtragisk,
while halvkomisk.
It is a tragicomedy.
Theatre work gives an actor
integrity. Just like Tom Cruise.
- Records In?
- Yes.
Here. So it's you.
Have you ever seen a fish shoal
swerve in and out behind a trawler?
It is so touching. Their way
to wriggle and swim at.
Just the way it meanders on.
I have always tried to twist me.
When a fish will wriggle, awaiting
it does not warrant. The just do it.
It is human, but fish.
I have respect for the fish.
Why I came to Molene.
A fish is free,
as it winds its way into the sea.
Until you catch it.
Now we come to the big night.
We are fighting for the island, and what do we do?
We win!
- Higher!
- We win!
Long live Molene!
CLOSED PGA. COUPE DE FRANCE
Have not you forgotten something?
Your moldy underpants.
I forgot my underwear!
You might think,
Tom Cruise happiness underwear?
- Stay with me!
- I'd like to, but can not.
Wind ruining my hair.
I will be brief.
Give everything you have in you, tonight.
- For the people!
- For the people!
- Remove the camera. Are you okay?
- Yes. We win.
Will giant Marseille devour
Tom Thumb, or miracle happens?
It's hard to believe, but anything can happen.
It's the magic of football.
Tom Cruise to see this.
- Get a doctor!
- Are you okay?
- Not really.
- He passed out from stress.
- Can you play?
- What? PlayStation?
- He should be observed.
- Can I get a club sandwich?
Patrick! What do we do now?
You must intervene.
Do not fail us.
- Me? Are you mad?
- We need 11 men.
Show us your magic right park.
- I have lost the ability.
- Do it for your own sake.
- I'm not in shape.
- Now it's your turn to run.
Orbéra, you have 30 seconds.
View to get their boots on.
Milan topudskifter Ziani fainted.
Hopefully nothing serious.
Perspiring at the thought of
to play on a team.
- Patrick Orbéra is back.
- What are Orbéra out there?
What a surprise
to see him on the pitch.
You just get strong again.
Get your ass out of here!
Now Bretons get its act together.
Come on! Fight!
- Police are at the factory now.
- What?
N'dogo to Berda
and on to Orbéra.
Goal!
You'll be fine.
Already two goals for Marseille.
It is a massacre.
It's hard to believe
Molene can offset.
FBI investigates crime.
They should not prevent it.
Orbéra do not feel good.
Father!
Molene advancing and Orbéra
shaking attacked by him. Beautifully.
Goal! Leandri scores!
Well, boys! Stay focused!
We can do it.
... gaining ground.
The crowd goes crazy.
- They just scored.
- We are not a bar here!
Breton are in counter attack.
Orbéra to Berda,
which places it over to Orbéra.
So whistle second half started.
There are ten minutes left in the game,
and Molene is completely flat.
- What's he doing?
- It does not matter.
It's ours.
You take it.
For Louise.
And there are goals! It is
a miracle! Masterful game! 2-2!
Molene surprised us and held out
against Marseille. Now it will be difficult.
GLAMOUR
The shot hit the post!
Molene is really on now.
- I dream.
- N'dogo dropped to his knees.
Let's hope it's not the heart.
We know he has a bad heart.
If you want to stop...
- I got me through the game.
- Are you sure?
He is feeling better. N'dogo
rises. He was just out of breath.
Good. Then I can kill him.
Enough about your shabby stars.
The law is the same for all.
No one should enter the factory
tomorrow. Seal engines.
- Should we stay here all night?
- We touches us not stain.
It's personal.
An incredible battle!
Can Tom Thumb meat giant?
They have only one hope: to keep out
until the shoot.
- This is pure torture.
- What a feat!
Now there's penalty shootout.
It's hard, but there is hope.
Who will not?
- Me.
- No.
Incredible! There is one player left
at the Breton teams: Leandri.
So it's you, David.
- It's your turn.
- I will not.
You. A strong shot.
- I can not.
- In the right corner.
David, this is your biggest role.
Right corner.
Right corner is what he expects.
So left.
None Panenka-kick.
I did not whistle.
Damn it.
None Panenka-kick.
No Panenka-kick.
We played really well.
I can be proud.
Thanks for everything,
I have done for the club.
- It is we who thank you.
- Yes. It has been good.
You saved my life.
I would like to say thank you.
Thank you all. You saved me.
- And Ziani?
- He will soon be printed.
Can you let go of me now?
Factory is closed for good.
Factory is saved.
Nénene played that Marseille
won the penalty shootout.
The odds 10
it was for 300,000 euros.
Plus box office
and television rights. We made it.
- Games In that we lost?
- So we won no matter what.
Ask everything back.
Work will resume tomorrow.
- Do you travel?
- Yes.
What about you?
When are you leaving?
I should throw you into the sea to
go behind my back and seduce my daughter.
Are you interested in
a 5-year contract?
- It could save my life.
- I have set up bonus.
- Just a bit.
- Have you also seen my tunbåd?
- Hurry. They sail shortly.
- No. There's try again tomorrow.
Do you wanna to London?
I have to serve 10 days.
I'll stay here and learn
to make pancakes. Come and visit me.
Now look the fool.
I'm going fishing!
Pis also.
Remove the grabber!
How are you, darling?
Have you had a good trip?
I knew the Breton sea air
would be good for you.
- You two know each other?
- She's my sister.
You said yourself
a good manager must be cunning.
3 WEEKS LATER
- tip flickers like a fly...
- You can fish with flies!
Sit.
Stop it with the fish.
- Do you like it?
- Better to have a ride in the sack with you.
This is a paraphrase of
capitalism. Rotand was a communist.
- Totally agree. Choppers away.
- What?
- For the next season...
- He has said yes.
But then he must play Hamlet.
I fight, I feints...
And in the end... I turn to!
Quiet, damn it!
