- Junior.
- Yes, Mum?
- Have you seen your father?
- Dad went to get water.
Hey, wait for me!
Pass it, come on!
Come on! Quickly!
Hmm?
Hmm...
Ha-ha-ha! Bet I
scared you, right?
Now tell the truth.
The hairs on my neck
are all standing on end
Hmm...
What was I supposed to do?
I know!
Yes! Yeah!
All right...
Oh!
Oops!
Hey-ho, Giselle.
Hmm... men!
- Did you see that?
- Yes, but what WAS that?
Only hard-as-a-rock,
sun-dried hyena poo-poo.
Oh, I see...
Fini!
Well... how do I look?
Erm... Uh...
Totally chic! Unbelievable!
Darling, this is a work of art.
I call it "Macaroni and Cheese".
It would suit you too, Giselle.
A neck wax wouldn't hurt, either.
No, thanks.
Hmm...
Mm-hmm...
It's a matter of concentration.
Yes, clearly.
And the perfect wind conditions.
Naturally.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Aw...
Billy?
Yoo-hoo, my turtle dove!
- What are you doing?
- Hello, Bonnie. You look lovely.
We're, erm... What are we doing?
Walking around, thinking, talking...
Hitting hyena poo into a hole.
That as well. I was
just going to tell you.
You hit... hyena
poo-poo... into a hole?
- With a stick.
- Oh, with a stick!
- Bingo.
- Interesting. And who thought that up?
- Me! I thought that up.
- I thought so.
What were you supposed
to do today, hmm?
Supposed to do today, supposed to
do... Uh... Socrates, do you know?
- You were to get water.
- Oh, that's right!
Oh, Billy...
I really think you are and
always will be a scatterbrain.
But I sure love you.
This is serious!
Er... don't tell me. You
went to a beauty salon!
- Hmm?
- It'll grow out. It's a law of nature.
- I didn't say a thing.
- Stop acting like such a fool!
The water that flows down the mountain.
It should have got here by now!
I'll play the water
down here with my drum.
Mm?
Many world politicians
and economic leaders
have gathered for the
167th Climate Conference.
Here to the north
they've all come,
as these brave officials examine the
dramatic effects of global warming.
Quick, the buffet's
getting cold.

from Thule, Greenland -
the gateway to the Arctic.
This was a wonderful
day, Winifred.
I've heard you say that
for exactly 714 years.
- Know what?
- Of course I know.
It's our wedding anniversary,
and I wouldn't have wanted
to miss a single day.
Captain! Sir, I believe
that we've run aground.
Hmm, what? Run aground?
Bah, something is
moving all-righty. Yes!
My dear, the time has come
for us to be getting
on our way once more.
# I've been driving all night
My hands wet on the wheel
# There's a voice in my
head That drives my heel
# It's my baby calling
Says, "I need you here"
# And it's half past
four And I'm shifting gear
# When she is lonely And
her longing gets too much
# She sends a cable
Coming in from above
# Don't need a phone at all
# We've got a thing
That's called "radar love"
# We've got a wave in the air
# Radar love... #
Oh, man!
You know what, pal?
Getting out while the
getting's good is good.
AAH...
Here's to you, jumping buddy.
Hmm?
My name's Toby. What
do they call you?
Tell you what, I'm
gonna call you Smiley!
Oh, crikey! Strong stuff, mate!
Cheers.
You know, Smiley, life's
just too stressful here.
How does an ocean cruise sound?
The high life on the high seas.
You know, relax. Just
really stretch out.
Good. Now smile.
Soon, you'll be braising
in a choice Burgundy.
You pathetic worm.
Death to the tyrants!
Now, look at what I've done
- I've forgotten the garlic.
Don't run away,
I'll be back soon.
Ooh la la!
Huh!
It's liberty or death!
Vive la France...
Adieu!
A chicken?
Hello and welcome.
My name is Winifred.
- And I, Winston.
- The name's Toby.
Charles. Pleasure to
make your acquaintance.
- With whom do I have the honneur?
- This is my friend Smiley.
Things got a little bit
steamy back in the bush,
so we thought we'd take ourselves
on a holiday to cool off.
First it was just me and Smiley,
but then old Sushi climbed aboard.
- Euh, Sushi...?
- That's my name.
Yes. Well, then, carry
on, my fearless marsupial.
And then, four weeks out to
sea, we met the tortoises,
and since then we've had a plan.
Ah, a plan is good.
Euh, what plan?
The migratory birds who used to
visit us on our island in the summer
told us of a paradise of wonder.
Far away from mankind.
Ah, oui, a charming idea.
What a stroke of luck that you
'ave met me. I will lead you!

Our supplies are just about gone.
The water holes are running dry.
Now that you mention it, my
throat does feel rather dry.
Oh, without water we're lost!
And without water we'll die!
My stress levels are through the
roof. I'm having an anxiety attack!
I'll shut up.
Well, I'll just
consult with the oracle.
An oracle consult?
This could be good!
O mighty oracle.
We humbly seek your advice in this
time of great fear and uncertainty.
Tell us, when will
the water come?
I would advise you now, more than
ever, to keep the oracle in good humour.
Aw...
That tree trunk just ate
our last bunch of bananas.
Harrumph. The water will
come... when it comes, I suppose.
- The water's coming?
- The cup falls down the well until it breaks.
What in the world is
that supposed to mean?
Please, Billy, you're
insulting the oracle!
If the water doesn't
come, we have to find it!
Not stand here talking
to a dried-up tree!
Did you just call
me a dried-up tree?
That guy has got
some nerve! Loser!
You offended the oracle! It
won't speak to us any more.
That was slick, loser!
Hey! My dad's no loser!
Humph!
Comrades.
Each one of us 'as tragically lost
their 'ome, their friends, their family!
Stolen from under our noses!
And now, comrades, we will find
ourselves a new place to live.
One where there is
no place for man.
Blaah!
Spoken with conviction.
Heads up, folks!
Now, that's some stress hormone.
We 'ave all crossed the Seven Seas
in nothing more than a rusty bathtub.
We 'ave weathered the
most terrible storms...
...and evil of winds.
We are so close to
our goal! Allons!
Raaaah!
# You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out
# You put your right foot
in And you shake it all about
# You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around
# That's what it's all about
# You put your left foot in...
Euh! Beyond those rocks,
my friends, lies paradise.
We are now ever so close
to reaching our goal!
# You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around
# That's what it's all about #
My dad is the best
dad in the world.
He is gonna bring us
water from the water hole!
He'll fight the rhinos, kick the
buffalo and chase away the elephants.
Whoa, dream on!
- Your dad's a zero. Get real!
- Hmm?
- And not to mention...
- Mention what?
Hmm?
All other meerkats have a
light coat except for him.
I guess my dad's
just one of a kind!
Note to self: Get
water. Piece of cake.
First shoo the buffalo away,
then fight off the rhinos
and then stop the elephants
from drinking us dry!
Hey, Billy! Psst!
If you let them drink first and leave
the water hole in a good mood, it's safer.
Giselle! Please, don't panic.
Just take a good look at that
idiot squad. Zero intelligence.
If they were any more clueless,
their heads would explode!
Really?
Chino wants a drink.
And Chino's gonna have a drink.
Boys, let's have a drink.
Hey, I didn't hear anyone say
YOU could have the first drink!
You talking to ME?
Are YOU talking
to ME... unicorn?
Did that guy just
call me a unicorn?
One sip and I'll be watching the buzzards
pick your bones in the blinding sun.
- Chino drinks when he wants to, si?
- Oh, yeah?
Then just try it and you'll see!
Yeah, in your
dreams, pizza-face!
Afternoon!
Cannonball!
Hmm...?
OK...
What's a hundred tons of raw meat
compared to a little natural charm?
Of a meek, weak, cheeky...
.. little freak.
Stay calm and smile.
Big toothy grin...
Distract them.
Hey, look over there!
And discreetly fill the...
And a little more for Daddy.
You've got a problem,
huh? Carrot top?
Carrot top!
Hey, who's talking
to you, lightweight?
Whoa!
Yaah-hoo!
My dad!
Junior!
You sure showed
those buffalo, Dad!
So, I sure showed all of them!
That big. They were
all that big, with hats!
Stop right here!
Not another step...
Oh, Billy.
Hey, everything's under
control, my turtle dove.
Ha-ha!
And I've got the water.
Uh, well...
Oh, Billy...
Let's recap.
Dad was supposed to chase away
the buffalo and get water... super
I told them all you were
going to get the water for us.
Uh... Aw...
Junior, wait a minute.
Our supplies are
just about gone.
- It's OK, I'll work it all out.
- Billy...
You're such a dreamer.
What will happen to us?
I promise, this time I'm
not gonna let you down.
Hey, Junior,
there's your old man.
The rhino whisperer.
- Erm, hello, my son.
- Yes, what is it?
I just wanted to let you know
that I promised your mother...
I've heard it before! You're always
making promises you can't keep!
Go and hang out with your lion,
or go off and play your drum,
or go off and hit some
hyena poo-poo into a hole.
You're not my father any more.
Billy!
- You shouldn't have said that.
- Leave me alone!
Socrates, we're needed.
The very fate of Okavango
is right in our hands.
What kind of plant
have you been chewing?
Think, and compare
us to eternity.
We're grains of
sand and that's all.
I'm not a grain of sand, buddy, I'm
a meerkat! My family needs water!
My son thinks I'm a big loser
- that's what's real.
And now my reality is
to go and find water.
And you're coming with me!
That is the stuff of a
wonderful, tragic ballad.
The sweet, yet sorrowful
song of Billy the Meerkat,
who set out in
search of water...
I can hear it! I can just
hear it! Yeah, that's my song!
- Alas, never to be seen again.
- Uh?
And his old friend
Socrates the Lion
spent the rest of his
days staying at home
and growing old, gazing
peacefully into the sky.
- Then I'll just go it alone.
- What?
I'd think that one over again
because if you follow the river bed,
you come to the Valley of Death.
Did you say Valley of Death?
So how do you know?
That's easy
- because I've been there.
You were in... In
the Valley of Death?
Yes, it was long, long ago.
You see my scar up here?
Well, deep within the Valley of
Death there lives a murderous shadow!
The leopard?
Such a beast, who can
slice you to pieces
before you see him coming!
He who enters the Valley of
Death gives up life itself!
- You're not coming with me?
- No, Billy.
Let's just do what we know how
to do, what we're best at doing.
Laying around and killing time.
Billy?
BILLY?
# Trailers for sale or rent
# Rooms to let, 50 cents
# No phone, no pool, no pets
# I don't need no cigarettes
- ah, but
# Two hours of pushing broom
# Buys an eight-by-twelve,
four-bit room
# I'm a man of means by no means
# King of the road #
Hey, what? Who do we have here?
Don't be shy, come
a little closer.
Why not sit here
with us for a while?
We won't bite!
- Ouch! Ouch!
- I fancy a change of pace, don't you?
- A smidge on the bony side.
- You don't have to be so negative.
Welcome, lad, to
the Valley of Joy!
I thought I was in the
Valley of Death, right?
Valley of Death?! Who put those
thoughts in your head, son?
Is this the Valley
of Death, old chums?
Of course not! That's absurd.
Safe travels, my friend!
Catch you later!
Hmm? Huh?
Hello?
Anybody there?!
- Hello?
- Hello... Hello...
Shh!
I knew you wouldn't let me down!
Now we're gonna be fine.
The leopard...?
Shoo, kitty! Go on back
through your cat flap.
Or come out and show your
whiskers, you scaredy cat...
Billy! Violence
will get you nowhere.
- Well, so what's plan B?
- How does running sound to you?
Left, right, right, left...?
Ha! That leopard's
scared of little old me!
A po-po-polar...
b- b-b-b-bear!
A polar bear? In Africa?
Cosmic.
And a kangaroo?
Tortoises? A two-legged...
- Raaah! - ...
mouth-monster?
And a chicken!
Huh? A chicken?!
Pardon! A Gallic cockerel
is no mere chicken.
Who are you? Who sent you?
Where are you from? Tell me!
He's one card short
of a full deck.
But I tell you,
the guy's got guts.
Exactly like us!
It wasn't me.
- Socrates?
- Mm-hmm?
What's the story
behind your scar?
I was very young, inexperienced,
rash and very hungry.
- My brother and I...
- Wait! You had a brother?
His name was Mambo.
We were inseparable.
Racing across the Savannah, chasing
buffalo and hunting antelope.
- Hold on... But you're a vegetarian!
- Youth, you see. I was a cub.
That was ages ago.
So Mambo and I, though
forbidden by our parents,
walked right up to
the Valley of Death.
And, as you can imagine, there was
a good reason we were forbidden.
After all, this is where
the elephants came to die.
But we knew no fear and we
were driven by curiosity.
Mambo?
- Was it the leopard?
- No, Billy. It wasn't the leopard.
It was a creature I've
never seen before, or since.
That's creepy.
But from that day, my only wish
is for all the animals of the
Savannah to live in peace and harmony.
Cock-a-doodle...
All right! Comrades, morning is 'ere.
We must set off before the sun is 'igh.
You'll have to go on without
me. I'm much too weak.
Non! I will stay with Sushi and
the tortoises and look after them.
As for the lion and the euh...
weasel, they will find the water.
And Toby and Smiley will
accompany them. Humph!
Shh.
Here at the Eden Paradise Hotel,
we now find the participants
of the 168th Conference on
Climate Change in attendance.
And here is someone who is clearly
not the least impressed with any of it.
Hello, I'm Maya. For sure, we all
know what happens at these things.
You grown-ups love to hear each other
talk and talk and nothing ever happens!
I'm sure you're all awaiting the
results of the conference, as we are.
ladies and gentlemen,
I welcome you all to the Eden Paradise
as guests of the Climate Conference.
The important job of the buffet opening
falls to our very own house mascot.
It's true, may
I present... Toto!
- The water's trapped like a rat.
- Who would do such a thing?
Going a bit fast, aren't we?
Woooah!
Billy, they've stolen your idea.
Hmm... How do they get
the hyena poo-poo so round?
I love it, I love
it, I love it. Cool!
Give me five! Whey-hey!
Australians!
Oh, he's so cute!
What?! Hunter!
They're a strange
breed of monkey.
They're cute, though. A
little funny-looking, but cute.
See you later, Billy.
Now! Where's the beast, huh?
Ahh!
Cannonball!
Ha-ha-ha...
Jaw.
Come on. Over here!
No! No!
You must know, I saved your
life on my lunch break, humph!
Er, now, now, gentlemen,
if you please...
I can guarantee you personally that
this whole unfortunate fiasco is over.
RAAAH!
- His ears have gone red.
- Here it comes!
Smiley, I can't think of a better
argument for good, clean outdoor living.
Eurgh!
Actually, the wellness suite is
solely for paying hotel guests.
Mm, wild!
Eh, Smiley, you try it on.
Two words, gentlemen:
mini bar, capiche?
Voilà!
Hands off! This is
the honeymoon suite.
OK, I'll watch for Hunter.
You do not wanna
mess around with him.
You'd better behave yourselves,
if you know what's good for you!
Cool.
Hold on. Better we
don't take a single shot.
We hate bad press.
Instead, catch and send
it to our casino in Vegas.
At least we can make a
profit out of this whole mess.
I don't trust that monkey.
Didn't I tell you
not to touch anything?
Where is the armchair?
Oh... you uncultured pig!
We sit on chairs,
we don't eat them!
Raah?
- And where's the little guy?
- Billy is in the water cave.
# Splish-splash,
I was taking a bath
# All-about-a
Saturday night, ooh
# Rub-a-dub, just
relaxing in the tub
# Thinking everything
was all right #
That's quite enough
rub-a-dubbing for today!
I happen to have a job here,
and I have no desire to get
into trouble on account of you!
I worked hard to
get my position.
What is it you want from me?
We want water!
Ah, right here you have water!
- So now if you would get out.
- One thing.
Why on earth did you help
us by hiding us in here?
Because with Hunter, you
would have been killed.
So, I see. You are
one of us, after all.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I was born in a Brooklyn zoo
- not that you know what that means.
I'm very, very sorry
but you're dead wrong
and I am certainly
not who you think I am!
I am not one of
your kind for sure!
We need water! I mean lots
of water! For all of us!
Good. Then we go over to
the dam, open the floodgates,
and run the water
to your valley.
And then you folks get lost!
And so what we have created is what
we like to call an oasis of peace.
In total harmony with nature,
which is of course the key,
and that's called
ecological tourism.
The result: guaranteed
sustainability,
with enough electricity
generated to power several cities.
You can imagine the benefits
for the local economy.
You should imagine what that means for
the poor animals that live downstream.
- Erm...
- They're dying of thirst without water!
Maya, go to your room at
once. You know nothing of this.
It's always about money, right?
That's all you ever think about.
These kids... Go figure.
And now, if you would follow
me into the complex interior.
I'll go in there, open the
spout, then I'll come back out.
Meanwhile, you make sure you
do not move from this spot!
Yoo-hoo!
Yes!
As you can imagine, the most modern
and stringent security measures
are utilised in this
most sensitive of areas.
Everything is state of the
art and hermetically sealed.
Unauthorised access is
totally out of the question.
Socrates!
Oh, I feel rather woozy.
I'm coming!
Ooh...
Oh, no!
Oh, no! Not again!
Raaah! Raaah!
Come, if you are
man enough to do it!
En garde.
Hmm...
Thanks.
Oh, no, that's totally
not fair. No, no, no!
Brave veterans, can
you stand the pace?
We're fine, thank you. Though we're
not quite as young as we used to be.
Well, I see, heeh-heeh...
a beauty in the
prime of her life.
Well, I'm 715 years old.
Winston is twelve years older.
She has aged splendidly, my
dear little lotus blossom.
You, with the sweet talk.
Ahh... I'amour!
The 'eroism of the
tortoises has saved us all,
but without water all that
awaits us is certain death.
And we are doomed if we go back to
free Socrates and release the water.
We are much too weak.
Then we have to get help! We'll
call all the animals of the Savannah.
Excellent, weasel!
Daddy? What are you
doing with the lion?
Maya, Daddy has no
time for this right now.
Set the lion free right now!
There is nothing I can possibly
do. The lion is dangerous
and we can't just let it loose
to run around all over the place.
And besides, I've already sold
the lion to a casino in Las Vegas.
Humph!
You have successfully
penetrated the security zone,
while your friends have
disappeared in the drink.
You! Looks like
you're the lucky one.
- Smith sold you to a casino in Las Vegas.
- Las WHAT?
You hit the jackpot.
Top of the mountain!
I've always dreamed of doing an
appearance in Las Vegas, just once.
Huh?
I'm not hungry.
Drink.
It'll taste a lot better.
Oh, Mum, did you have
something to drink?
Of course I did!
You're a really
bad liar, you know.
Junior?
This is my water
hole, crocodile bait!
- So?
- You go find your own puddle, si?
Or you can find my horn!
Instead I'll use your horn
as a toenail clipper, OK?
You're asking for it.
300 pounds, and not an ounce
of brain in their fat heads.
On three. One... Two...
Three... go!
No!
Hey, look!
Aw...
Mum!
Hold on, sweetheart.
STOP!
Haven't you idiots got
anything better to do?
- Erm, nope.
- Eh, no.
Have you ever thought why you two
are fighting in the first place?
Naturally. Because...
- Eh... 'cause...
- Mm-hmm...?
- What do you think, Biggie?
- Hey, I don't know.
Just as I thought.
From now on, go and play your
juvenile games somewhere else!
Got it? Hmm?!
Let's go talk to Angie. She is
actually the president of Okavango.
A female president!
Hmm, why not?
I will attempt a bit of diplomacy
with 'er, the way I know 'ow.
My skin is utterly and
completely dried out.
My nails are all cracked, my complexion
- ruined!
My lashes are like barbed
wire. The end is near!
Giselle...
- We've got other things to worry about.
- Oh, well, that's charming.
I'm falling apart and you say, "We've
got other things to worry about!"
Oh, do not despair, mesdames!
Oh, no! I hear voices!
Aah, I know this is the end.
And I look like such a mess.
Ahem!
'Ello, the name is... Charles.
Charles! My, my,
what a lovely name!
By the way, the oppressive
'eat can do nothing to 'ide
your noble and sublime beauty.
Ooh! Mmm!
If I may be so bold, you seem to 'ave
been blessed with a delightful nose.
Mmm...
So soft! And the
most silky trunk!
Pooh! Go marry her, then.
We must call a
conference. Tout de suite!
- A conference?
- A gathering of all the animals.
There we must figure out
'ow this hero of yours
was able to discover the water.
I have a hero? Erm, who is it?
- Yoo-hoo!
- Billy?
Hmm...
Then someone's got to
blow the great horn!
Dad?!
Mm.
There is a great gathering of the
animals in two hours, called a conference.
You don't want to be late!
I'm on my way!
Ugh! Let's see, two
hours. I know I can do it.
Thank heaven for shortcuts.
Well, look who's here.
It's the lightweight!
Hey, Biggie.
What's so funny, carrot top, eh?
We are all gathered together to
discuss our precarious situation.
As you all may know, this is our first
great historical animal gathering.
For the duration of the proceedings,
no-one will inflict harm upon another!
- Fine by me!
- Meerkats only really count as snacks!
No one is allowed
to touch anyone!
Eh?
Billy? Your report.
Yeah. So, here's the scoop.
Uh, I found the water, cool.
Who cares what that
worm has to say?
He's nothing but a squashed
fly on my hoof, sí?
Problem is, the water's trapped
way up in Leopard Canyon,
by these massive stones.
It was the leopard?!
No it was because of a bunch of strange,
ugly creatures, naked, without any fur!
Oh, that's gross!
We're talking
bloodthirsty, awful beasts.
They call themselves humans!
What a pile of garbage!
And since when did we ever listen
to the drivel from a meerkat?
Chino is a dumb buffalo, but
for once he's got a point.
Mon ami. This, well, meerkat
has shown more courage
than all of you combined.
Oh, such big words
coming from you, you...
.. you little half-pint.
Do you 'ave any idea what this
little 'alf-pint has been through?
Do you just know 'ow many
of my comrades I 'ave lost?
The things I 'ave seen
from a dark dungeon,
where my kind and I were locked up only
to languish in the smallest of cells,
while wondering if we
were to end up on a skewer?
Or perhaps a burgundy sauce?
Mankind treats us
like... animals!
Well, that certainly
was clear as mud.
And that's why we
have to do something!
We have to free
up the water now!
Er, correct me if I'm
wrong, but doesn't that mean
we have to go through
the... Valley of Death?!
The water has always come,
and it will come this time.
We just have to wait.
The water is not simply water.
It is the blood
of our forefathers.
Come on, what's with
these two old-timers!
These two tortoises know mankind
better than any other alive!
And, of course,
much, much longer.
- Good...
- ... evening.
My name is Winston and...
.. I am called Winifred.
We were born more
than 700 years ago...
.. on an island located deep
within the Pacific Ocean.
In all that time, we have
come across many human beings.
They have stolen
and have murdered
and destroyed everything
many, many times.
And we let it happen.
And because of this,
we have lost everything.
Our beloved home
is sadly no more.
Where once were blooming flowers
of all colours is now dry and arid.
Where once the very air
vibrated with the twittering
of thousands of kinds of
birds is now only silence.
Where once seals and the beasts
of the ocean bobbed in the waves,
all life is now at an end.
Galápagos, our wondrous home,
is now little more than a
wretched, black, dark and oily mass.
The entire world is nothing more
than a black, dark and oily mass.
Except for this place here.
But if you do
nothing to stop it,
this place too will become no
more than a blackened stain.
For Man is a thief
who comes in the night
and takes what he
wants from the land.
He is like a snake who eats
his own tail to survive.
But the Earth does
not belong to Man.
He's only a tiny part of it.
Man did not weave
the fabric of life.
He's but a thread within it,
for we all share the same breath.
The rising mists of
the lush green forests,
the refreshment of the
rocky mountain breezes,
the perfumed scent of the wind
after a cooling shower of rain,
the plants, Man
and we, the animals.
What Man doesn't realise
is what he does to the land
he ultimately does to himself,
and when the land
is finally destroyed
and the animals are either
driven out or killed,
Man will rule over
the Earth alone.
Then, lost and forlorn, he too will
be wiped from the face of the Earth.
But that is a cold comfort to us
now, for every one of you will perish
if you don't defend
yourselves against humanity.
My dear, you spoke wisely
and with great care.
Well, that's because they were
your thoughts that I spoke.
What you spoke was
greater than every thought.
And still all meaningless,
compared to my many years with you,
our years together.
It's been wonderful.
Good. So good...
Winnie?
Winnie?
Winston and Winifred have gone
to sleep for the last time.
But they live on in all our
dreams and in our hearts.
The day 'as come.
Madame, we are waiting
on your command.
But shouldn't we
consult the oracle first?
I don't think so, dear.
Been there, done that.
- So, to battle!
- And down with the beast!
And down with the beast!
Allons! Et vive la liberté!
Well! The least they could
have done is consult the oracle.
I get no respect!
What happened to
tradition? It's a disgrace!
Did you hear what I heard?
We've all been asking
for advice from that guy?
A hairdresser who talks from both
sides of his mouth at the same time?
A proud army, to
be sure, Madame.
It is a true honneur to be
allowed to march with you.
Yes, we're proud, but
are we strong enough?
Remember, the buffalo and
the rhino didn't come along.
The 'eroic courage of our brave
soldiers will make up for them.
Socrates, hang in
there. We're coming!
How about those who don't
have a banana milkshake?
Or a drop of water?
Hey, I can read you like a book.
You wanna make me feel all guilty
so that I'll help you escape.
But you're wasting your
time. I can't do anything.
The big guy with the rifle's
got the key to the cage.
Here I am, confined to a cage,
but yet somehow I remain free.
You are outside, but you're
not really free at all. Are you?
Hmm...?
So...
Duty calls!
Just go. Playing
monkey must be fun.
# You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out
# You put your right foot
in And you shake it all about
# You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around
# That's what it's all about
# You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out
# And you shake it all about
# You do the hokey-pokey
And you turn yourself around
# That's what it's all about #
Clearly you are a meat-eater.
One can tell by that,
euh, unpleasant breath.
And 'ave a little respect!
Just look at yourself.
Stand up straight!
Chest out!
And why are you so late?
What kind of discipline
is that for a soldier?
And take your incredibly
filthy paws off my uniform!
To your unit! This
year, please...
- Everything all right, my brave hero?
- But of course!
I simply 'ad to reprimand
the cowardly deserter.
Showtime!
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Toto?
Oh, damn.
The most worthy of foes,
yes, without question.
Madame, if you'd allow me, then I
strongly suggest we send a message.
Send a message? Hmm...
And if we're not understood?
This message will
be unequivocal!
Oh! What's that?
Each conference participant
is leaving in an almost
giddy, light and ecstatic mood.
Come on.
Comrades! We cannot
wait any more! Let's go!
It's time for heads to roll!
Giselle, I've never heard
you speak that way before!
Thank you.
And attack!
'Ard. Very 'ard.
This could be tricky.
What is that roar?
It's the buffalo.
And the rhinos, too!
What do you know?
Hey, lightweight!
Eh...
See you in hell... carrot top!
Socrates! Socrates!
Start your drumming, Billy.
You've got the groove!
I've got the groove!
Uh-huh!
Mon Dieu.
Do you see that? That's my dad!
Billy!
Turtle dove!
Billy, the time has come.
Party time!
# Well, she got her daddy's car
# And she cruised through
the hamburger stand, now
# Seems she forgot
all about the library
# Like she told her old man, now
# And with the radio blasting
# Goes cruising just
as fast as she can, now
# And she'll have fun, fun, fun
# Till her daddy
takes the T-bird away
# The girls can't stand her 'cause
she walks, looks and drives like an ace
# She makes the Indy 500 look
like a Roman chariot race, now
# A lot of guys try to catch her
# But she leads them on
a wild goose chase, now...
The hotel is
finished. I'm ruined.
- Are you satisfied?
- Yeah.
Look at how happy they are.
# Well, you knew all along that
your dad was getting wise to you, now
# And since he took your set
of keys you've been thinking
# That your fun is
all through, now #
Charles, your passion thrills
me more than I can say.
Ah, ma chérie, this is the first
step on the journey of a lifetime.
Huh?
From the 169th Climate Change
Conference here in New York...
Huh?
I see that we may entertain
some unexpected visitors.
And it appears that the
animals are finally going
to make us accountable
for our actions.
Well, what do you know?
- G'day, Ken! -
Howdy-ho, jumping buddy!
Pal, help me out.
Where's the conference?
What? The conference
of the animals?
Why, it's in America!
America? I just happen
to have a shortcut.
Oh, what a shame. I could
have given him a shave.
