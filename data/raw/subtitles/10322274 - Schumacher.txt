[Michael]
You have to become one with the car.
You should know exactly
how much stress you can give to the car.
Because there's a limit always,
and you should be careful,
like with everything in life you like,
you have to have that kind of feeling
to not go over the top or not be under it.
And if you do that,
then both of us will be satisfied.
The car and I.
100% perfection.
To reach 100%, that's... that's my target.
I'm just that type of person.
I couldn't live with anything lower.
I don't like to talk about
my quality very much
because I would sound arrogant.
And I don't like to talk about my failures
because it's your job to find them.
[engine revving]
[engine decelerating]
[engine splutters, stops]
[engine starts]
[engines revving]
[shutters clicking]
There was a real air
of excitement in the paddock.
Everybody's aware of who's coming up
through the system.
We had a sense that this was someone
who's looking very promising.
When Michael came into Formula One,
this was a time when there were big names.
Senna was World Champion with McLaren,
Mansell was driving for Williams,
Uh, Prost was at Ferrari.
You know, those are really big names.
[Flavio Briatore]
All the drivers were over 27, 28,
with a lot of experience.
And Michael was the young one.
When Michael arrived,
all the drivers looked at him like,
"Too young, too early, too soon."
[Richard Williams]
Most Formula One drivers come up
through karts, Formula Three.
And he'd been helped
in making the transition to Formula One
by having raced sports cars for Mercedes.
- [man indistinct]
- Yeah. Yeah.
[in German]
Luck got him into Formula One.
A driver had dropped out,
and they needed a new one.
Michael appeared in Formula One
through a stroke of luck, really,
when Eddie Jordan had a seat available,
all of a sudden,
partway through the season.
[Willi Weber, in German]
After I found out, I immediately
got on the phone and called Eddie Jordan.
I said, "Eddie, you've got to
give me that chance."
And he said,
"Who in the hell is Michael Schumacher?"
I said, "You got to remember.
Formula Three, won Macau, won Fuji."
"Okay, now I know."
I've seen him in Formula Three.
And I have this...
or the team has this attitude
to give youth a chance.
And that's the way our team is formed.
[Willi Weber, in German]
Just everything that lay ahead of us,
just the possibility that he could show
what he was really capable of,
that was so incredible,
but we had no idea.
That evening we sat out on a square
and ate pizza, undisturbed.
The place was packed.
I think four-to five-hundred people.
And no one came up to us.
That was the last time
that nobody bothered us.
[engines buzzing]
I remember you could hear
the people in the Tannoy...
[indistinct PA announcer]
...describing
what's happening in qualifying.
And this name,
Michael Schumacher, kept popping up.
Well, he was... he was a sensation.
When Michael qualified seventh,
it was just like,
"Wow! Here is a new star!"
Everybody was just so excited
that this new driver
had exploded onto the scene.
- [engines buzzing]
- I'm really happy.
But anyway, I have to say,
with this car you can do
this qualifying time, you know.
It makes a lot of fun to drive.
And also for the time,
I'm really happy, yeah.
Everybody noticed that.
Everybody in other teams noticed that.
You know,
he became immediately a hot property.
After the race in Spa,
I called Willi Weber.
And we met with Michael,
I think on Monday.
Monday or Tuesday in London.
At the time, our team
was already fighting for podium.
We weren't fighting for a Championship,
but on some occasions
we got close to the podium.
So we signed an agreement.
[Michael, in German]
It cam e s uddenly. I was totally surprised.
I'd just driven my first race,
and the fourth-best team
in the world makes me an offer.
I was gobsmacked.
I was stunned
that it could happen so fast,
and I was so happy about the contract.
It was an absolutely fantastic situation.
[crowd cheering]
[James Allen]
He had this freshness about him.
You know, his skin
was very tight on his face
and always very clean-shaven.
And he just radiated this confidence.
Michael was racing
as a boy against hard men.
[commentator Murray Walker]
And it's Schumacher in fourth position
in the Benetton.
Schumacher is indisputably
pushing Ayrton Senna.
Michael Schumacher comes through
leading the Belgian Grand Prix.
Well, is Michael Schumacher
gonna win his first Grand Prix
at the circuit
where he first drove in a Grand Prix?
Twenty-three years old.
The youngest Grand Prix winner
for a long, long time.
It's the first win ever
for Michael Schumacher.
And he puts his arm out.
And he is naturally elated.
Oh! [laughs]
"Yeah! I did it," he says.
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[inspirational music playing]
[inspirational music soaring]
[PA announcer indistinct]
[in English] I really can't describe it.
I mean, it's something crazy.
I think the German fans
have waited a long time
for Formula One Grand Prix victory.
And I really give this victory
to the German fans.
[interviewer] Any last words
for anybody back at home?
I think my parents.
I wanna say just hello to them.
[emotional music playing]
[Michael]
It all started with four years.
My father was always interested
in working around, like,
mountain bicycles or little things.
And the... the thing he did was,
we had another old moped,
I would say, with 40K's speed.
And he put it on... on this kid go-kart.
And from the beginning on,
I just enjoyed it very much.
I always liked it very much.
I remember when I was six, seven years,
my father started already
to rent out go-karts
for the club at this time.
And I was always with him
to work on the go-karts,
to help him
and as well to test the go-karts.
When once he finished one go-kart,
I had to test the go-kart if it is okay.
And so, I... I was always together
with him in the go-kart.
We did everything together, and... [inhales]
...it was just a... a big pleasure.
[emotional music continues]
[Rolf, in German]
When he was just 8 or 9,
he looked after his brother, if necessary.
I could ask him to see
that everything was locked up,
and he would do it.
Michael was always very dependable.
[Gerhard Noack, in German]
The Schumacher family had a food van,
and then later, they had a restaurant.
Financially,
the Schumacher family was like...
Rolf began his working life
as a bricklayer building chimneys,
but eventually took over
the running of the go-kart track.
And Elisabeth
always had to stay until the end,
until all the guests had left.
[Ralf, in German]
My parents had to work very hard
to give us a normal life.
But many rich kids are also poor,
as their parents have no time for them.
We had our parents with us at the track,
which was a big playground.
[PA announcer speaking German]
[speaking German]
[Michael, in German] We always used
the cheapest equipment available.
I fished discarded tires out of the bin,
put them on my go-kart,
and won races with them.
I was always glad to have won
with the worst and not the best equipment.
Having to really fight like that
was an additional motivation for me.
[in German]
Good afternoon and welcome to Kerpen,
to the World Junior Karting Championship.
A total of 18 nations are competing here,
with approximately 80 drivers.
A driver who isn't competing for Germany,
although he is German
and is even the odds-on favorite here,
is Michael Schumacher.
You're competing for Luxembourg. Why?
[in German] Because the qualifying races
in Germany cost money.
And if we're eliminated, we don't qualify
for the World Championship.
But in Luxembourg
we're the only competitors,
it doesn't cost anything, and we qualify.
[Rolf] He was already practicing
like a world champion when he was a kid.
He already knew what he wanted
when he was a kid.
[PA announcer speaking German]
[Allen, in English]
He had to do everythin g to get to the top.
And... And I think there was
this hard-boiled professionalism
from a very, very young age.
Because any small misstep along the way
would have been the end of everything.
[Mika Häkkinen] 1983 in Kerpen-Manheim.
That was actually the...
the first time when we raced together.
It's one of those strong memories
that stayed in my mind
in my racing career.
Of course, it was a circuit,
which was a home circuit for Michael,
so he knew every corner for 100%.
And it was difficult
to race against him on that track.
[PA announcer indistinct]
[kart engines buzzing]
[Häkkinen] Looking at the style
that he was driving, it was incredible.
There was a part of the racetrack
in front of the barrack,
where there's a very high-speed chicane,
and it was fascinating to see Michael
coming through that chicane,
having a completely different
driving style than other drivers.
Very controlled.
The driving style was very physical.
The level of mistakes that he did
through that chicane
every time was very little.
The other drivers, one lap was good,
the second lap again
went a little bit wrong.
But Michael was all the time consistent,
very controlled.
And when I was watching,
I recognized straight away, you know.
This... This guy is... He's good.
We were like 13, 14 years old.
And...
And full of confidence.
[PA announcer, in German]
In first place, Michael Schumacher.
He's already won 460 marks today
and will now receive a further 236 marks!
[crowd applauding, whistling]
[Michael, in German]
After those years, I was convinced
I would always be a go-kart driver.
Because I could never have imagined
making it into the Formula class
for financial reasons alone.
[engines buzzing]
[Willi Weber] In 1988,
a young man kept catching my eye.
His name was Michael Schumacher.
It wasn't the victories.
It was the way he moved the car.
I then asked him to come
and drive for my team.
Of course, money was an issue.
Michael Schumacher
had nothing at that time,
not even 500 marks to finance a season,
which even then cost 600 to 700 thousands.
Willi Weber said to us,
"Come over to my place tonight."
"I'm giving him a five-year contract,
a car and 2,000 marks a month salary."
That, of course, was crazy!
[Michael, in German]
If you're involved in motor racing,
I think everyone dreams of competing
in Formula One events one day.
And that's my dream too.
[emotional music playing]
[Corinna Schumacher, in German]
First of all,
I think I'm incredibly fortunate
to have met Michael.
He's simply
the most lovable person I've ever met.
I once made dinner for him
on his birthday.
He was the only one who helped me
to clear up and do the dishes.
And I thought, "That's a proper bloke!"
And yes, he was really funny,
and that's what I saw in him.
I fell in love with him simply
because he was a wonderful person.
I just sensed
that he was something special to me.
I never once thought,
"He's a terrific racing driver
at the start of a dazzling career."
No one could have guessed
that would happen.
- [crowd buzzing]
- [shutters clicking]
[Michael, in English] When I started,
I said, "Don't make a star out of me."
"Don't push me too high up.
I don't want this."
[indistinct chattering]
[Corinna, in German]
What he really didn't like was the press,
the people, all the hype around him.
That's not what he wanted.
He wanted to do the sport.
[indistinct chatter]
[exhales deeply]
[in French]
He was looking for a normal life,
and he had a hard time understanding
why he couldn't have that normal life.
It's true, he could sometimes
seem unsympathetic.
Because there were so many demands on him.
It was often too much and constricted him.
Because he's an extremely
reserved person, shy.
And sometimes that was his way
of dealing with his shyness.
- [emotional music playing]
- [crowd buzzing]
[in English] At the time when
Schumacher appeared in Formula One,
Senna was
the preeminent figure in the sport.
[crowd cheering]
[commentator]
Ayrton Senna's third World title ensures
that he'll be ranked
among the all-time greats.
Ayrton had a mystique about him,
but mostly because he was incredibly quick
and incredibly competitive and aggressive,
um, and challenging
towards other competitors.
So, he dominated the sport.
[applauding]
[Bernie Ecclestone] He was the number one.
He was the one that, if you asked somebody
that started in Formula One,
"What do you want to be?"
They'd all say, "Ayrton Senna."
- Everyone looked up to him.
- [applauding]
If you're suddenly starting
in the same thing, you want to be him.
[crowd buzzing]
[Ecclestone]
Here, you've got, uh, at the time
basically an unknown for what he was,
challenging the best.
[Finnish National Anthem playing]
[engines revving]
[tense music playing]
- [engines buzzing]
- [tense music intensifies]
In the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours,
Schumacher was behind Senna.
[Murray Walker] And Schumacher challenging
Ayrton Senna in the McLaren.
As they come up to the hairpin,
there is a contact there.
Who is it? It's Schumacher.
And who has he hit? It's Senna.
And now they are sorting their way around.
Are they gonna stop the race?
On the first lap, at the hairpin bend,
Schumacher and Senna seemingly out.
And I am pretty sure
the race will not be stopped.
And I have no doubt,
a very angry Ayrton Senna,
who may well regard
Michael Schumacher's tactics
as being just a bit too rumbustious.
I don't think Michael set out
to try and upset him.
I think Michael was racing
everyone in Formula One
the same way he'd race everyone,
as he should have done.
[inaudible]
[Ross Brawn] But it...
it caused some friction.
And, um, Ayrton tried to put Michael
in his place a few times on the track,
which, um, upset Michael.
He didn't think that was...
that was equally respectful.
So... So, they were a bit fractious
in that early period.
Hey, you fucked up, and it's fine.
I came and talked to you.
It's fine. I came and talked to you.
You see, at the time
that Michael really was a super driver,
when he had the fight with Senna,
Senna smelled the guy was somebody.
When you're a lion, all lions will feel it
when the young lion is arriving.
And you want to keep the territory.
[Ross Brawn] '94 was definitely
a growing-up year.
A growing-up year for Michael,
a growing-up year for me.
Nobody could reconcile that our team
had come from almost nowhere
and we're winning races
and mounting a championship challenge.
[commentator] Michael Schumacher
sliding that car around the circuit.
[victorious music playing]
This is your race leader,
Michael Schumacher.
[Ross Brawn] He'll make the difference on
those dayswhen a winner's in the balance.
[commentator] Where is Ayrton Senna?
That's the question.
Oh! And Senna spun.
Senna is out of the race.
There he comes.
This can't go wrong.
The checkered flag is out.
Michael Schumacher
wins the Pacific Grand Prix.
And oh boy,
what a season are we gonna have
in Formula One this year.
[Ross Brawn]
We were now championship challengers,
and we weren't used to it.
We didn't know how to deal with it.
And when you're beating Ferrari,
and you're beating McLaren,
and you're beating Williams...
These are established teams.
And here was this, uh,
you know, T-shirt manufacturer
coming in with this kid from Germany
and suddenly beating everyone.
[PA announcer indistinct]
[Flavio Briatore]
So, he won the race in Japan.
We were waiting in the airport.
And Michael was very confident
he was quick enough to beat Ayrton,
and maybe to win the Championship.
When talking with Michael,
it's like somebody with...
Like he's done this job all life,
you know.
This was normal. And Senna...
You know,
five years before or four years before,
he had a poster of Senna in the bedroom.
Going into Imola,
Michael was very, very fast,
looking very strong.
And Senna knew that he had to win Imola.
He had to start
to close the gap against Michael.
He had to impose himself on Michael,
because otherwise, Michael was gonna
get away from him in the Championship.
[engine buzzing]
[Murray Walker]
Senna followed by Schumacher.
Schumacher is the chief rival
to Ayrton Senna.
[suspenseful music playing]
[co-commentator] Senna goes through.
Followed by Schumacher.
And into Tamburello.
[Murray Walker]
What on earth happened, I don't know!
Senna is still in the car.
[dramatic music playing]
[co-commentator]
The race has been stopped. Red flag out.
[Murray Walker] Well, I say, that's about
190 miles an hour at that point,
the exit from the Tamburello.
Everybody was silent.
It was a very strange atmosphere,
you know.
[commentator]
Michael Schumacher has, uh, stopped
and got out of his car.
Helmet off, uh, grim-faced.
[Richard Williams] Fact is that
what he was doing when he crashed,
when he went off the circuit,
he was trying
to stay ahead of... of Schumacher.
[Michael] We've seen
many crashes like this,
even crashes that were worse.
Crashes that, they seem
to be worse than-than his crash, and...
and you don't expect anything like this.
You just think,
"Yeah, maybe he has a bruise on the arm
or maybe he has a broken leg."
Then you go back. They put up the grid.
You don't know what's going on.
Nobody comes to you
and explains the situation.
And we just, you just think that
"Yeah. The race has to go on."
"Everybody's going to race,
so you're going to race."
You don't see why you shouldn't race.
[Richard Williams] Nobody knew
at that point if Senna was dead.
Had he been declared dead at the circuit,
they'd have had to stop the race.
[Murray Walker]
The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix
has been won by Michael Schumacher.
[Flavio Briatore]
Before I went to the podium,
I said to Michael,
"No champagne, nothing."
He asked me, "How is Ayrton?"
I told him, "Not in good shape."
That was the first time I saw Michael
as a different guy.
[German National Anthem playing]
[Michael] We went up to the podium.
He told us,
"Yeah, he, uh, he's in a coma."
But a coma can be many things.
It can just be something
that is going to be okay the next day
or very bad. But you don't judge it.
And because you still don't believe
that there is something
particular or very dangerous
or very heavy, you don't believe it.
And I... I still...
I... I think it was two hours after the race
when Mr. Walkinshaw came up to me
and said, "It's looking very bad."
And I thought, "No! He's in a coma,
but coma doesn't mean anything bad."
He said, "No, it looks not too good."
Uh...
And then somebody
came to me later and said, "He's dead."
And one minute later, uh,
the next one came to me and said,
"No, he's in a coma."
But there was
so little information at this time
that you didn't know what you...
what you should think about this.
And I still... I still didn't believe
that he's gonna be dead.
I... I just couldn't...
couldn't think of that at that point.
I just thought,
"Yeah, no, he's going to be the champion."
"He maybe misses one or two races,
and then he's coming back again."
[sighs]
But the worst... the worst was really
the two weeks after this.
I mean, once I really had to accept
that it is, that he is dead.
I mean, this... this was...
just something crazy.
[softly] Yeah.
With Senna gone,
Michael Schumacher was now
the number one figure in the sport.
Although he hadn't yet won
a World Championship.
[interviewer] Was it is easy to...
to drive again?
[sighs deeply]
I mean, in Silverstone, I went there...
and you suddenly saw
many things with different eyes.
I went around with a road car
in Silverstone through the circuit,
and I just thought,
"This is a point you could be dead."
"This is a point you could be dead."
I thought, "Crazy, you always tested here,
you always raced here."
"But there are many points you can crash
and you can be immediately dead."
That's the only thing I was thinking of.
And I didn't know
what's gonna be the situation
if I'm going to be in a race car.
I wasn't sure.
Can I drive without thinking that,
or I am going to drive now,
always thinking, "You can be dead here."
"If you go off here,
it's going to be bad and..."
That was... something very strange.
I wake up during the night,
and I, like,
sleep maybe three hours a night
and stuff like this.
[exhales]
[Corinna, in German]
We were totally shocked.
We asked ourselves
how it could have happened.
And Michael really asked himself
if everyone was acting correctly.
It was really, really...
really difficult.
It was a real struggle for him,
but he was a master
at blocking things out.
He was able to focus so intently
on whatever he was doing
that he blocked out everything else.
So I think that mentally he's very strong.
It's something he just has.
Extremely strong.
He still shows me
every day just how strong he actually is.
Damon Hill was now
leading the Williams team.
And he gave Michael a fight.
[commentator] Damon Hill wins
the British Grand Prix.
Magnificent!
Damon Hill wins the Italian Grand Prix.
He won here last year.
It was the end of a hat trick...
It was a complex, turbulent,
human whirlwind of a season.
[commentator] Michael Schumacher wins
the European Grand Prix here at Jerez.
Michael Schumacher
has opened up the gap again.
[Allen] And it was
an intensely human drama.
The races would swing like a pendulum
between Damon and Michael.
[Murray Hill] Damon Hill wins!
[commentator] Hill has got
the biggest challenge in his life
to go head-to-head
with Michael Schumacher.
[Michael, in German] The point is,
that you know his is the decisive race
and all tactics, the overtaking maneuvers,
the situation will be based on that.
[engine revving]
[commentator] One point
between Schumacher and Hill.
[Damon Hill] So the Championship went down
to this incredibly thrilling last race.
Realistically, it didn't look like
it was gonna be that easy.
So, there I was.
Suddenly in a title fight
with, uh, Michael Schumacher.
[commentator] The red light is on
here in Adelaide.
And we are racing
for the last time in this season.
And Michael Schumacher takes the lead!
Schumacher takes the lead.
Or is it Damon Hill?
It's Schumacher who leads from Hill.
[engines revving]
[Michael] I had to fight very hard
with the car.
It was very difficult for me
to keep the car
on the road the whole time.
And as well, I...
I couldn't go away from Damon.
[Damon] We were just nose to tail
for about 20 laps or so.
Michael had just started to pull away,
and I was starting to think,
"I can't... I can't keep up that pace."
[Michael] I had a time
where I suddenly, uh, found a line
where I could disappear a little bit,
for I think two seconds,
two-and-a-half seconds.
I was all the time on the limit,
really fighting very hard.
And then, on the bump,
I just, uh, stepped out.
Then, I painted the wall.
I was already disappointed.
I thought, "Shit,"
but then I felt,
"Okay, you... you still can go on."
When we went around one of the corners,
I saw him coming back on the track,
and it looked like he'd just gone off
and then came back on again.
And I saw his car wobbling.
When I drove over to the left,
I was doing a bit like this
to check everything, clean off the tires.
I saw an opportunity to go past,
and I felt, "I have to go."
[commentator] Look at Damon Hill
and Schumacher. Oh no!
The moment I turned into the corner,
it was Damon
who hit me first on the sidepod.
And his car came back across
and hit my car,
and he went up on two wheels.
[Michael] In a moment, I was up in the air
and then into the tire walls.
So no, I... I couldn't understand it.
[Murray Walker] Oh! Out goes Schumacher!
The German is out
of the Australian Grand Prix,
and Damon Hill only has to keep going
to be World Champion.
[Damon]
The point situation was very simple.
He had a points' advantage on me.
If none of us finished, he'd be Champion.
[engines buzzing]
[commentator] Damon Hill will have
to go back to the pits.
[Damon] I could see
my suspension was broken.
So, I couldn't carry on.
As a competitor, he was going
to win come what may.
Michael did what he had to do
to stop me beating him.
Put me in the car,
um,
in Adelaide,
and I've got a points' advantage,
and my rival comes up the inside,
what would I do?
I don't know. [chuckles]
[Murray Walker]
The 1994 World Championship
has been won by Michael Schumacher.
- [cheering]
- [horns blaring]
[cheering]
[emotional music playing]
[indistinct chattering]
[squeals] Oh!
- [woman] Whoo! Whoo!
- [cheering continues]
[music soaring]
[Michael, in German]
Corinna has given me great support,
and she certainly is doing so now.
That's why Corinna wanted to come,
and I wanted her to come too.
And it looks like
she's brought me luck again.
[cheering fades]
[Corinna, in German]
Actually, I always went with him
throughout those years.
It might have been in the bus
or somewhere behind the scenes,
but I was always on the road with him.
We always enjoyed it together.
It was a support to him,
just knowing he wasn't alone.
Because we were traveling
around the world, changing time zones,
we really did make sure
that he slept well.
And Michael planned practically
everything down to the minute.
Get up at such-and-such a time,
15 to 20 minutes in the bathroom.
One night, when we were in Suzuka,
I realized there was no way
I was going to fall asleep,
so I spent half the night
sitting on the toilet,
in order not to wake him up,
to let him have a good night's sleep.
So I read my book in there.
On the other hand, when we were at home
and Michael had to leave early,
I never heard him.
[clicks tongue] He was so quiet.
He always came to my bed
just before he left,
stroked my arm, gave me a kiss,
and said, "I'm leaving."
And he was gone. He never woke me.
He was always very considerate towards me.
- [horns blaring]
- [crowd cheering]
[inspirational music playing]
[Walker, in English] The crowd is roaring.
The flags are waving.
To greet home their idol
and their hero, Michael Schumacher.
And he wins the German Grand Prix.
There is the hero.
And there are the people
who admire and venerate him.
- There are over 100,000 Germans here.
- [music intensifies]
This is what
they have waited for for so long,
to see a German win the German Grand Prix.
Michael Schumacher enters
the last corner of the last race
of the last lap
to win the Pacific Grand Prix in Japan
and to become the World Champion of 1995
as he was the World Champion of 1994.
And, uh, no further proof is needed
that he is the best driver of his day.
- [indistinct chattering]
- [laughing]
I don't think Michael ever wanted
to keep increasing the numbers
of World Championships.
If he'd stayed at Benetton,
I think he'd have won
the World Championship in '96 as well.
But that didn't motivate him anymore.
When you're in the car,
you are controlling your own destiny.
Yeah.
You only get one chance.
[Willi Weber, in German] In Formula One,
everyone is very discrete.
No one would approach
a driver in the pit and say,
"Can we talk?" Never.
[in French]
He received a number of offers.
He could stay where he was.
At McLaren, he could drive
one of their cars with a Mercedes motor.
And he could come to Ferrari.
[Willi Weber, in German] At that time,
Niki Lauda was working
for Ferrari as a consultant.
The situation at Ferrari
was anything but good.
Niki Lauda approached me and said,
"At McLaren, he'd just be one of many
who get in a car and win races."
"At Ferrari, he'd be an exceptional driver
who, after their fallow years,
would win races with this Ferrari."
And that appealed to his fighting spirit,
which he'd developed as a go-kart driver.
He'd won with used karts and tires,
so why shouldn't he do that at Ferrari?
My last piece of advice was,
"If you become
World Champion in a Ferrari,
you can throw away your passport."
- [crowd cheering in distance]
- [pensive music playing]
- [woman shouting] Schumacher!
- [fans calling, shouting]
- [crowd buzzing]
- [music continues]
[crowd buzzing, applauding]
[Todt, in French]
Ferrari is the oldest team.
And in Italy, Ferrari is like a religion.
So, there's an expectation.
There's a passion for Ferrari in Italy.
[in English] Expectations on any driver
who goes to race for Ferrari are enormous.
[PA announcer indistinct]
[Williams]
The Ferrari President said, you know,
"Well, last year we had
two very good drivers,
but this year we have a star."
[Luca di Montezemolo] Drive a Ferrari
means to have a lot of pressure.
Drive a Ferrari means
that if you don't win, you are an idiot.
Drive a Ferrari means
to have also responsibility
because you drive
not a normal Formula One car,
but you drive a legend.
You drive something unique.
[Eddie Irvine]
We joined Ferrari at the same time, '96.
I remember when I sat in the car,
I said, "It looks worryingly different
to everything else."
And, unfortunately,
I was proved correct. [chuckles]
That car was a disaster.
[engine revving]
[Eddie Irvine] So, for quite a while,
we really didn't understand
how bad the car was.
And, as it turned out,
it was pretty unfixable, really.
The basic philosophy of the car was wrong.
[commentator] Here this morning,
Damon Hill clouted Frentzen.
And that's a problem
for Schumacher already.
Looks like Schumacher's engine is gone
o n the warm-up lap.
[Walker] Now, that is incredible!
And he has, before the race begins,
wrecked. Schumacher is out of it.
At the French Grand Prix in Magny-Cours,
he didn't make the start.
It was... It was a lame duck of a car.
And Michael was... was in the car
on the back of a tow truck.
It was like a symbol of impotence.
[Michael] I'm not sure
whether we're going to solve
all these problems, uh,
in a couple of months.
I... I don't see the... the point.
We... We are in a position really
to win the Championship.
It must... must be a lot of luck,
and, uh, and maybe a dream.
But because I'm not a dreamer,
I am a realistic person, uh,
I think it's... it's true what I'm saying.
In that first season, I remember,
on the Friday night before the race,
everybody had gone,
all the drivers had gone,
the team personnel had gone.
But in the Ferrari garage,
there was a car being worked on.
It was Michael's car.
There were three mechanics and Michael.
And Michael was talking quietly
to the mechanics.
I got such a strong impression
of how hard Michael was willing to work,
how he would be the last one
in the garage every night, with mechanics.
You know, he wouldn't leave early
to go off and do something else.
He would be there, with them,
working with them,
making them feel his presence.
Making them feel he cared
about their work on the cars.
And that transformed the team.
[Corinna, in German] Michael was always
one of the last to leave.
In the years with Ferrari,
he would be in meetings till ten at night.
We never went out for a nice dinner
at a restaurant.
No. We sat in this tent the whole time.
I waited, we ate pasta,
we talked,
then he was gone again,
another meeting, then he came back.
But I was thankful
for every minute we could spend together.
[indistinct chattering]
[Eddie Irvine, in English]
Michael is super professional.
He just said,
"Listen, we gotta work through this."
And he worked very, very hard.
The great thing about Michael
being in the team
was everybody knew there was nobody
who could drive like he could drive.
[Walker] During the night,
the rain absolutely hammered down.
It has continued to do so all day.
The prospects are for a totally wet race.
[commentator] And there is the Ferrari
of Michael Schumacher.
He's got past Gerhard Berger.
He's up into third place.
And he's right behind Villeneuve and Alesi
and will soon be challenging for the lead.
[Ross Brawn] If you got a terrible car,
it's still terrible in the rain.
You can't overcome that.
In Barcelona,
he managed to find a way of driving and...
and coping and, uh,
and adapting his style.
I don't think there were
many drivers who could do that.
He just disappeared,
and no one was anywhere near him.
[Walker]
The genius of Michael Schumacher
is making up
for the deficiencies of the Ferrari.
This is classic racing
in appalling conditions.
[Ross Brawn] You know,
he always loved the rain.
You can jump to a different level.
And I think those are the circumstances
which demonstrate
the true geniuses in the sport.
[Ralf, in German] As kids,
we only drove on slicks in the rain.
We went to the go-kart track
whenever we could.
This allows you to develop
incredible control over the car.
You gain confidence in it
and become one with it.
And then you can perform
these otherwise impossible miracles.
[Walker]
It is gonna be an historic win
for Schumacher, for Ferrari.
The last corner!
And Michael Schumacher wins
the Spanish Grand Prix
after an absolutely superlative drive.
[Eddie Irvine] To win races in that car
was the greatest achievements,
I would say, of any driver.
It's... It's... It's beyond credibility
how that happened.
I have no idea how can he can do that.
- [horns blaring]
- [crowd cheering]
[indistinct chattering]
The challenge of taking Ferrari
back to World Championship level
is a challenge
that Michael couldn't resist.
I talked to him about it
quite extensively, actually.
And he just felt
that the right thing to do
was to take on that challenge
and make Ferrari great again.
Give them back the title
that Ferrari had been wanting since 1979.
He wanted to do something that,
you know, hadn't been done by Prost,
hadn't been done by Senna,
hadn't been done by any of the drivers
in... in recent history.
That was a real challenge.
1997. There was a feeling now, going into
the second year with Michael at Ferrari,
that they should be challenging
for the Championship.
In a way, the momentum was with him.
The Tifosi's expectations were very high.
We knew we were gonna have a real showdown
between Villeneuve and Schumacher.
[in German] I hope it'll be a real duel
between us on the track,
and that neither teammates
nor lapped drivers
nor any other drivers intervene.
[interviewer in English] What do you think
will be the key to victory here?
Well, first of all, not being taken off.
[chuckles] That will be very important.
And then just being fast,
being quicker than Michael. That's all.
[Walker] And it's go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Villeneuve gets away,
and Schumacher gets away
better, better, better!
Michael Schumacher leads
and up alongside Villeneuve.
[suspenseful music playing]
We knew that Jacques had a quicker car.
It was just a question of whether or not
he and the team would be able
to use strategy and speed
to get the better of Michael.
[Walker] And the gap
between Michael Schumacher
and Jacques Villeneuve
is down to just over one second.
Some kind of gearshift problem,
because Villeneuve is all over him, look!
He's through! Oh yes!
[distorted engines decelerating]
[thump]
[engines buzzing normally]
[engine whirring]
[engine stops]
In his mind,
Jacques Villeneuve had hit him.
He wasn't putting on an act.
In his head, that's what happened.
So, in that fraction of a second,
what happened with him?
Who knows? It... It wasn't a conscious...
It wasn't a premeditated act.
It was something which happened,
and he came back and was convinced.
And he wasn't trying to convince others
that he'd not done wrong.
[engines buzzing]
[Luca di Montezemolo] For Michael,
it was, in a psychological point of view,
a very difficult moment.
He was in the lead. Ten laps to go,
to win, in 1997, the Championship
in the second season with Ferrari.
[Ross Brawn]
Michael came back to the pits,
convinced that Jacques had hit him.
And then, when we showed him the video,
he realized that that wasn't the case.
Um, that... that he had driven
into Jacques Villeneuve.
And it was one of those moments
that Michael had two or three times
in his career, where his commitment,
his competitiveness, his dedication,
just went that one step too far.
It's a very difficult thing
for us to judge,
but I think
he overstepped the mark that day.
[muffled engines buzzing]
[Mark Webber] Often,
he overstepped the mark
when he really didn't need to.
When he had done enough,
whether it was qualifying, he had pole,
whether it was a race victory
which he had in the back,
whether it was a one-on-one,
a battle with somebody.
You know, at times,
did he have always to believe in himself?
That he was doing the right things?
Because there was this paranoid perfection
that he needed always
to do more to prove more to himself.
Because ultimately, a lot of the time,
he was racing himself. [chuckles]
He was battling with himself.
That, "Have I done enough today?
Do I want to do more?"
"How am I gonna destroy the opposition?"
"What do I need to do..." [inhales]
"...to continue to be the main man?"
SCHUMI, THAT'S INSANE!
VILLENEUVE REAL CHAMPION
"I'M NOT TO BLAME, I'D DO IT AGAIN"
SCHUMI LOSES HIS SMILE
I think people that are
and want to be in control
don´t want to accept the fact,
"Maybe I did it wrong."
So, that wasn't his character.
[in German] Michael is a Capricorn.
He was born under the sign of Capricorn.
And a Capricorn never apologizes,
can't apologize, and never makes mistakes.
The word "mistake" doesn't exist
for a Capricorn. He never makes any.
- [man] Morning from London, Michael.
- [man 2] How are you feeling, Michael?
[man speaking German]
[in English] All the races before,
I've been put onto the sky from the press,
and suddenly after that weekend,
I have been put
into the ground from the press.
Obviously, uh,
I'm as much a human being as... as anyone.
And things can happen to me
as they can happen to anyone else.
And it happened to me,
which I didn't want to admit at the time.
But now I have no chance than to admit,
and I understand what I did.
[somber music playing]
The governing body had a look at it
and basically disqualified him
from the '97 Championship.
It is quite a big deal,
which has never happened before
in this sport.
- [shutters clicking]
- [man] Michael, any comment?
[car door shuts]
[Corinna, in German]
We stayed in the chalet.
We played a lot of games
because he wanted to unwind a bit.
It was a wonderful time with many friends.
Sometimes there were 30 of us there,
and we really had a lot of fun.
We took everybody with us.
Grandma, Grandpa, Auntie.
The whole plane was full.
We really enjoyed it.
[gentle music playing]
[man laughs]
- [chattering in German]
- [male voices laughing]
[Corinna] He really enjoyed going there.
We were there for six weeks.
And we didn't talk much about Formula One
or anything relating to his work.
We just had fun.
[chattering in German]
[Corinna] Michael exercised a little,
but not that much during that time.
When the testing started again, he said,
"I'm curious to see if I'm still
fast enough, if I can still do it."
Michael always had self-doubts
in that respect. "Can I still do it?"
[Sabine Kehm]
It was very important to Michael
that nobody in the team ever noticed
when he was really struggling,
gritting his teeth,
maybe even having doubts
or feeling desperate.
He was extremely good at hiding that.
Because outwardly,
when he went to the garage
or anywhere he could be seen,
he was energetic and dynamic.
[in English]
He had realized very, very early on
in his racing career
that you only get out what you put in.
And that became his mantra.
It had to be absolute all-out commitment.
It is like a war.
If you don't go all in,
then you're not going to come out on top.
And that is the philosophy
of Michael Schumacher.
[Gianluca Pilot, in Italian] In the car,
everything had to be perfect.
He always paid close attention to detail
and demanded that we do exactly the same.
And with people, too,
he had an incredible eye for detail.
He always had a smile, a "Thank you,"
and a "Please" for everyone,
even at times of great tension.
This was the attention to detail
that he dedicated to each of us.
To him, the car was important,
the team was important, with everyone.
[in English] There were days
when Michael would make the difference.
You know, a driver can be so influential
in those things, motivating the team.
Michael knew all the staff.
He knew their names
and sometimes knew their wives' names.
He would play football with them.
You know, he was a great motivator.
And people would do an enormous amount
to support Michael
and... and try and make him successful.
[Corinna, in German]
If you can fill everyone with enthusiasm,
then they'll do everything for you
and enjoy doing it.
I think that's the key.
Even the guy who cooked their pasta
was happy when he came
because he always thanked him and said,
"Your pasta is the best!"
He said, "Pasta aglio e olio! That's it!"
He loved it.
Even the cook was
a totally integral part of the team.
It was a big family
that made us feel secure.
- [applauding]
- [whistling]
[Michael, in English]
I think my mechanics, my engineers,
they know now what to think about me.
They trust 100% myself. I trust 100% them.
Every time I'm on the...
on the circuit the whole day,
I think about what I can change
on the car to make it quicker.
[engine buzzing]
[Allen] They were spraying
their track to test the wet tires.
They were testing the intermediate tires.
They were trying different things
if they wanted to stay on
until it was almost dark.
The amount of hours that he put in
on developing the car
and testing outside of the public view
of the Grand Prix is incredible.
[Eddie Irvine] We'd start testing
at eight in the morning,
sometimes we'd finish
at like eight o'clock at night.
He demanded a lot from himself.
He was just on such a limit
to try and get the results
in cars that weren't
as good as the opposition's.
McLaren was just
fundamentally so much better
that there was no way
we were gonna catch up.
- [indistinct chattering]
- [inaudible]
[Eddie Irvine]
That really got to him, you know?
As it would anybody.
Schumacher, who'd been developing
the Ferrari with the team,
you know,
making it more and more competitive,
discovered that he had a new rival.
The latest Flying Finn, Mika Häkkinen.
[indistinct chattering]
Right from the first test
Mika Häkkinen knew that he had
a monstrous weapon in his hands.
The McLaren was a rocket ship that year.
And Ferrari had to fight really hard
to develop their car to be able to match.
[Walker] Mika Häkkinen leading.
Where is Michael Schumacher?
...a tremendous flume of spray.
Mika Häkkinen, of course,
has got a clear track in front of him...
Mika Häkkinen is gonna give him
a hard time right from the beginning.
[intense music playing]
The pendulum swung between Häkkinen
and Schumacher throughout the year.
Häkkinen made a few mistakes.
Schumacher had some... some brilliant races.
And he was in contention
for that World Championship.
[Mika] Michael was definitely on edge.
His approach of winning
was that there was no fear.
There was no thinking that
"I can get hurt
or somebody else can get hurt."
I did go to speak to Michael.
I said, "Look, you know, man,
you cannot do this."
"You cannot do this
when we go such a high speed,
300 kilometers per hour,
and I come so much quicker."
"You cannot block me."
And he was just
lifting his shoulders basically
and said, "Mika, this is racing."
Final move, you move again.
- Before you come in...
- Yeah. Yeah.
We had great fun and respect
for somebody's success.
And vice versa. We have our own life.
Uh, and in a racetrack,
we were competitors.
So, it's difficult to be a friend.
I think there...
there's the two sides, isn't there?
There's Michael, the racing driver,
uncompromising, fast,
you know, determined, um, hard racer.
And then there's, of course,
Michael the private man, the family man.
Um, you know,
I've had many social evenings with him...
[inhales]
...drinking Bacardi-Coke,
and he'd have a cigar,
and he was a completely different person.
Because, of course, at that point,
there's no competition.
It's just sharing... sharing
a nice social moment together.
[Corinna, in German] At parties, he was
the first to arrive and the last to leave.
He loved it.
We laughed so much, had so much real fun.
And the kids still remember that,
that it was always fun.
Michael loved
throwing people into the pool.
We all ended up in the pool every time.
That was Michael's thing.
Even at our wedding,
people were thrown into the pool.
He couldn't sing well.
It was one of the things
he didn't do so well.
But he always sang "My Way"
because he knew the lyrics. [laughs]
Really funny.
[laughing]
[vocalizing]
Oh my God!
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[Mark, in English] There were many times
where he was just on his own.
No one was close to him.
I think it was pretty difficult
to get to know Michael.
A difficult guy to really, uh...
He was... There was a...
There was... There was still a fence there.
[in German] Michael is very suspicious.
He always has been,
during the initial period.
Until he thinks he knows someone
or can trust them,
then he opens up completely.
That wasn't only the case with me,
in the beginning,
but also with other friends.
But he's always been
a very suspicious person.
I have to say that.
But if he opens up, then 100%.
Really all the way.
- [crowd buzzing]
- [PA announcer indistinct]
[commentator] Drivers' Championship,
Mika Häkkinen leading the way
by seven points from Michael Schumacher.
Alongside him on the front row,
his teammate, David Coulthard,
making it an all McLaren front row.
[Walker]
Mika Häkkinen starting in pole position
for the ninth time
in thirteen races this year. Five lights.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Häkkinen leads away again.
Irvine again comes up left.
Damon Hill has made
an excellent start and leads! And leads!
Damon Hill gets ahead
of everybody at La Source.
Schumacher going round the outside,
and he is hitting Häkkinen.
Schumacher hit Häkkinen.
Since Häkkinen
was already out early in the race,
you know, this was an opportunity
for Schumacher to take advantage,
to take the ten points
while Häkkinen wasn't going to score any.
And that would be key
in what was obviously going to be
a long and tight battle for the title.
[commentator] If Michael Schumacher
can stay where he is now
he will be taking the lead
in the World Championship by three points.
The track is covered in water.
[Williams] The tires, huge tires,
are throwing up spray,
throwing up water.
And if you're following,
you can't see the other car.
You can't see the sides of the road.
You can't see anything.
[David Coulthard] Michael was winning
by a long margin.
The team told me,
"The leader's coming up to... to lap you."
But of course,
in the rain, you can't really see.
You have little mirrors,
but with the spray, you can't judge
where the... the other car is.
So, I was waiting, waiting for him
to overtake
as we went down to Blanchimont,
which is a fast left-hander.
[commentator] Now let us not forget
Coulthard in these appalling conditions...
Oh God! Michael Schumacher
hits David Coulthard
and is out of the Belgian Grand Prix!
Maybe he should have been
a bit more circumspect
about trying to pass him!
[Ross Brawn] Michael was definitely the,
let's say, the passenger in that accident.
And the first part of the track
would have been very easy for Coulthard
to pull over and let Michael through and...
But he didn't.
He stayed and made it difficult.
I think David came off the throttle.
You know, you never do that in the wet,
where drivers can't see what's going on.
You don't take your foot off the throttle.
And Michael hit him.
[Walker] ...in the World Championship leads.
Now, what is he up to?
He's storming down the pit lane,
presumably to... Look at him! Look at him!
He is saying,
"I am going to the stewards."
He is going to Coulthard.
He is going to have it out
with David Coulthard.
I knew he was angry.
[chuckles] You know, his,
his neck was... was red.
And his eyes were out on stalks.
And obviously, the team kept us apart.
Do you want to fucking kill me?
[indistinct arguing]
[engines buzzing]
[Coulthard] We met up in Ecclestone's bus
to try and clear the air.
I said to him, "You know,
I accept my part in the crash,
but you need to take
some responsibility as well."
And he went,
"No, I don't see it like that."
I said, "But Michael, in fairness,
you crashed into the back of me!"
"I didn't reverse into you."
And it led
to a conversation where I said,
"Surely, you must be wrong sometimes."
And he thought about it for a while,
and he went, "Not that I remember."
[PA announcer speaking Finnish]
[Todt, in French] The expectation
and the disappointment kept growing.
Because in people's minds it was,
"Michael has arrived,
so Ferrari will win immediately."
So, he arrives in '96,
then '97, '98, '99.
And at some point, one wonders
if Michael is the driver for us
or should we have someone like Häkkinen?
[Walker, in English] Mika Häkkinen
is on magnificent form here.
We've had
the qualifying session this morning,
and Mika Häkkinen was fastest
and comfortably fastest
in all of those sessions.
Michael Schumacher,
this morning in the warm-up,
was seven-tenths of a second slower
than Mika Häkkinen. Second fastest.
And it is
go at Silverstone!
Now!
[engines buzzing]
[crowd gasping, murmuring]
[Michael, in German]
The front wheel had smashed the cockpit,
and it was still stuck somewhere in there.
I couldn't get out,
and I was trying to pull my leg out,
which was trapped.
[pensive music playing]
[Michael] So I'm lying there
and notice that I'm calming down a bit.
And suddenly I feel my heartbeat fading,
becoming slower and slower,
until suddenly it stops completely.
And I think,
"This is probably how it feels
when you're on your way upstairs."
[Corinna] I remember I was at home.
And he waved from behind
all those sheets to tell us,
"Hey, everything's all right."
[crowd applauding]
That was a moment
when I thought, "Oh my God!"
But on the whole,
we'd always made it
through his races safely.
Which is why I was certain
he had a few guardian angels
that were keeping an eye out for him.
I don't know if it's just
a kind of protective wall
that you put up yourself,
or if it's because you're in a way naive,
I don't know.
But it simply never occurred to me
that anything
could ever happen to Michael.
At the end of '99,
they'd had four seasons,
they'd won some races,
they'd been competitive,
but more patience was required.
Now people were beginning to wonder.
Is it ever going to happen
for Michael Schumacher and Ferrari?
[speaking Italian]
[Piero Ferrari, in Italian]
He knew he was a winner,
that he was a champion.
We were sure we were close...
[inhales sharply]
...but we hadn't won the Championship,
and when that happens,
there are always doubts.
[in English] What concerns me,
I have no opinion about that,
and that's the natural situation.
[Todt, in French] First part of 2000,
things weren't going the way we wanted.
And suddenly, we found ourselves
in the middle of the season,
at a point where it was difficult
to believe we could win.
So we were questioning the qualities
of the whole team
and Michael's as well.
[crowd buzzing]
[Todt, in French]
We now had to win every single race.
Because if we didn't,
we wouldn't become World Champions.
[Walker, in English]
This is the crunch point.
Schumacher leads.
Häkkinen is in second place.
Michael Schumacher looks in his mirror
to see whether Mika Häkkinen is there.
Michael Schumacher win at Monza in Italy
and close the gap
between himself and Mika Häkkinen
in the World Championship.
[interviewer] This is your 41st victory,
which put you equal second all-time
with Ayrton Senna.
Do those records mean a lot to you?
Yes. It does mean a lot to me.
[inhales deeply]
Sorry. [exhales]
[sighs shakily]
[crying softly]
[interviewer] Thanks, Michael.
Mika, over the last two races,
Michael's been magnanimous enough
to admit that, on the day,
you had the fastest car, McLaren.
Do you think today
the Ferrari was just the faster car?
[Michael sobbing]
Can we have a break? [chuckle]
[Walker] The tension is genuinely
well now unbearable.
My palms are literally sweating.
I am expecting it to be
a nail-bitingly tense race
every inch of the way.
The title showdown at Suzuka,
this was his fourth final day
Championship showdown.
And it probably is the most important race
in Schumacher's Formula One career.
And Ferrari knew
how quick Mika Häkkinen was.
He was all about the speed.
He was uncomplicated.
He just was unbelievably,
inspirationally fast.
[engines revving]
[commentator] He was almost meditating
with his head down, his eyes closed,
and just thinking his way
through this race.
Michael Schumacher needs
to deliver this Championship
for himself and for Ferrari.
I think Häkkinen is
totally relaxed, on the other hand.
[in French] We had lost the last race
in 1997, 1998, and 1999.
The same could happen in 2000.
[Walker] Watch for that.
Four lights, five lights
in the Japanese Grand Prix.
It's go! And Michael Schumacher
cuts straight across
and drives Mika Häkkinen towards the wall.
But Häkkinen has done it again!
He has taken the lead
as he did last year and the year before.
A terrible bit of news
for Michael Schumacher.
[rousing music playing]
[commentator] It's Häkkinen,
the race leader,
coming in for his first stop
at the end of lap 22.
[engine revs]
[Walker] Michael Schumacher,
of course, is in the lead.
And he knows he's got
that "Go! Go! Go!" in all this lap.
And Michael is in. James, are you there?
I am indeed, Martin.
And I've worked out that Häkkinen
took on 13 laps' worth of fuel.
That's all.
7.4. A tiny bit more fuel
for Michael Schumacher. Ah!
Look at this! Here comes
Mika Häkkinen on the right.
And he's gonna get through
ahead of Michael Schumacher.
The status quo has been retained.
[rousing music continues]
Out come the McLaren mechanics
for a second stop.
[Ross Brawn]
Häkkinen was leading the race.
You know, he led the race
for quite a while.
There was a situation where
we were waiting for the pit stops
to... to finish,
and I was looking at the track,
and I could see Mika was coming out.
[commentator] Häkkinen, 7.4.
These next two laps
could well decide the Japanese Grand Prix.
Now here is the pit stop. James!
Yes, he's... Look, he's made
half a second on Häkkinen on this lap.
He's had a 26.8-second lead.
[Ross Brawn on radio] Look out, Michael.
When you get out, he'll be there.
I'll talk you through.
You're looking good. It's looking good.
It's looking good.
It's looking fantastic, Michael!
Well done. Well done. Fantastic.
Just keep it on the road now.
[Walker] Here comes Schumacher
rejoining the track,
and he is ahead of Mika Häkkinen.
The horns blow
because they are as keen on Ferrari
in Japan as they are
in most other countries.
[triumphant music playing]
[Walker] Can they believe it?
Out come the Ferrari mechanics
to greet home their ultimate hero,
Michael Schumacher.
[triumphant music soaring]
[cheering]
[exclaims on radio]
[Ross Brawn on radio]
You're going on broadcast.
Give us your feelings for broadcast.
[Michael on radio] Shit!
You are great, Ross! You are great, Ross!
All of you guys.
[crying] Oh my God!
[screams joyfully]
Shit! We did it! We did it!
Thanks! Give Corinna a big kiss from me.
[Walker] Now we will see joy.
Look at that!
[chanting] Michael! Michael!
Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael...
[crowd cheering]
[inspirational music playing]
[cheering]
[cheering, laughing]
And when he finally
clinched the title in 2000,
all the pressure he'd carried
on his shoulders was released.
[crowd cheering]
He no longer felt like
he owed anybody anything.
He delivered Ferrari
the World Championship they'd wanted
for 20-plus years.
And from that point onwards,
everything was a bonus.
And he drove with freedom after that.
He drove with his heart.
He drove with passion.
He drove with a sense, a relaxed sense of,
"This is... I'm doing what I love to do,
but I don't owe anybody anything anymore."
And he was again onto another level.
[emotional music playing]
Michael was very exciting to watch
through the sheer speed that he achieved.
It was a style
that depended on
100% concentration, 100% commitment.
Going into a corner at 150 miles an hour,
knowing that your talent
is going to enable you
to get out the other side safely,
it's a special gift.
Michael got that natural talent,
that natural speed,
higher than anyone else.
And what was so special
about Michael is that he didn't waste it.
He did everything he could
to enable himself
to exploit that natural talent
that he had.
Michael was a little bit fearless,
and people knew that.
Not quite sure if they could challenge him
and take him on.
Michael didn't think about it
because he knew his limit,
and the other guys were thinking,
"This is a bit risky," and would back off.
You didn't see Michael back off.
[in Italian] He was a professional,
but he also showed us he had a heart.
He had the charisma of a leader,
and that was his great gift to us.
This was the contribution
he made to Formula One.
[cheering]
[commentator, in English]
Michael Schumacher
gets his seventh
Formula One World Championship
on a truly, truly eventful day
for Formula One racing.
This is history!
[Sebastian Vettel, in German] He's been
my idol since I started driving go-karts.
He's been a big influence.
The racing driver Michael Schumacher
is my hero, my motivation to win races.
The sport fascinates me,
and I know other racing drivers,
but there was nobody like him.
There was a beauty in the brilliance
of the execution.
His execution, the teams' execution.
To win on a sustained level
year after year is incredibly difficult,
and the proof of that
is how rarely it's happened.
And what Schumacher and the team achieved
in that period from 2000 through to 2004.
Not giving an inch to the opposition,
not giving them a sniff of a hope,
was absolutely incredible.
[triumphant music playing]
He did become untouchable.
People look back at periods of dominance
and think of them as golden ages,
which they were,
the five Championship years in a row.
People will always remember it.
[Gina Schumacher, in German]
When we went to races with them
and saw all the commotion,
saw how many people
thought he was great and admired him,
I thought that was totally brilliant.
And I thought,
"Yeah, that's my dad,
and I'm really glad he's my dad."
I just have huge respect for Dad.
I have always had that.
He just has this presence.
When he walks into a room,
everyone goes quiet.
That's how I remember it.
And I was also
one of those who kept quiet.
But like I said, my hero
when he walked into a room.
So when I think to myself,
every time I look at him, I tell myself,
"Yes, that's how I want to be."
Such strength, such total peace of mind.
[in English] At the end of this year,
I've decided together with the team
that I'm, uh, going to retire from racing.
I should thank my family,
who at all times
supported what I was doing.
And without their support,
without their strength to survive, uh,
in this business and this sport,
and to perform,
I think it would have been impossible.
And I can't be thankful enough.
I retired simply because
I didn't have the passion
and the motivation anymore.
I was tired.
[Corinna, in German] He found a different
action. He didn't just sit on the sofa.
He had to go here
and there, do this and that,
one thing after another.
Michael was restless.
For example, if the weather is nice,
"I could go skydiving!",
but then it's not one, it's 24 jumps.
After he left Formula One,
he thought, "What am I going to do now?"
He asked me, "What should I do?"
And I said, "I'll drive rallies with you."
"I'm not so good at map-reading,
but I can try." And he said, "No way!"
I think that Michael's comeback was
obviously personal desire and fulfillment.
He... He didn't have anything to prove.
But he obviously felt
that he needed to drive,
and he needed to compete
and to join that... that Mercedes journey.
[inaudible]
[in German] That was a new phase,
a completely different approach for him.
He realized he could experience
Formula One in a new way.
No longer being
a World Championship contender
was exciting for him.
And he enjoyed it up to a certain point.
[in English] I was never at his level
in terms of driving performance.
But I definitely know,
towards the end of my career,
my last year of 37,
gaps that I was going for
were closing before I got there.
Because I think you just get old.
It's just the journey of life, you know.
[crowd cheering]
[Kehm, in German] We often stayed
overseas between races,
as it would've made no sense to fly back.
He often said, "What am I doing here?
I miss my family. Why am I so far away?"
"I've realized it isn't
as important as it used to be."
"My family is more important now."
[dramatic music playing]
[anchorwoman] Michael Schumacher,
the most successful driver
in Formula One history,
is in the hospital...
- [anchorman speaking French]
- [anchorwoman speaking German]
[overlapping news reports]
[anchorman] Michael Schumacher
is in critical condition at this hour.
[Corinna, in German]
Shortly before it happened in Méribel,
he said to me, "The snow isn't optimal."
"We could fly to Dubai
and go skydiving there."
[Todt, in French] Fate is unpredictable.
Fate had usually been kind to Michael.
But this time, unfortunately,
he became a victim of misfortune.
On 29 December 2013,
Michael and his family's life
was turned upside down.
The family's life changed completely
from one minute to the next.
A father, such a strong leader,
with such a great personality,
and that disintegrated
from one minute to the next.
[gentle, dramatic music rising]
[in German] I have never, um, um...
blamed God for what happened.
It was just really bad luck,
all the bad luck anyone can have in life.
Um...
It's always terrible when you say,
"Why is this happening to Michael or us?"
But then why does it happen
to other people?
Of course, I miss Michael every day.
But it's not just me who misses him.
The children, the family,
his father, everyone around him.
I mean, everybody misses Michael,
but Michael is here.
Different, but he's here,
and that gives us strength, I find.
We're together.
We live together at home.
We do therapy.
We do everything we can
to make Michael better
and to make sure he's comfortable.
And to simply make him
feel our family, our bond.
And no matter what,
I will do everything I can.
We all will.
When I think about the past now,
the images that pop up in my head
are usually of the four of us having fun.
I see images of us
driving a go-kart in the meadow.
I see images of us
where we're out and about
with the ponies, sitting on the carriage.
Really many moments
that resonate with joy.
The highlight was always
when he came home.
That was so nice
because he used to
put up with us for hours
after he'd got back,
although he was probably very tired.
But we didn't notice that.
We were just happy to have him home.
Yes.
And since the accident,
of course, these experiences,
these moments
that I believe many people
have with their parents,
are no longer present,
or to a lesser extent.
And in my view,
that is a little unfair.
I think Dad and me,
we would understand each other
in a different way now.
Simply because
we speak a similar language,
the language of motorsport.
And that we would have
much more to talk about.
And that's where my head is
most of the time.
Thinking that would be so cool,
that would be it.
I would give up everything just for that.
Yes.
We're trying to carry on as a family
the way Michael liked it and still does.
And we are getting on with our lives.
"Private is private," as he always said.
It's very important to me
that he can continue
to enjoy his private life
as much as possible.
Michael always protected us,
and now we are protecting Michael.
