The film you're about to see
was born under a lucky star.
How are you? Come in.
Have a seat.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
Following what's going on
with Carsten Villar's book?
In the papers, yeah.
It's been attacked viciously.
THE SWAMP
Is this the copy
marked up by your lawyers?
I'm impressed.
He takes risks. He's brave.
Or masochistic.
You can't write a novel about politics,
using transparent aliases,
accusing everyone of depravity,
and hope it goes down well.
I figured that everyone
would prefer it went unnoticed.
Except journalists, bloggers.
It's sensational stuff,
unstoppable on Twitter.
I thought
no one reads books anymore.
True. Fewer readers, more books.
But more tensions.
Writing makes people hysterical.
Meaning?
It scares them.
The less they read,
the more wary they are of writing.
Ours is a civilisation
of the written word. Take internet.
People write more, more often
and surprisingly with more care.
An infinite minority.
It adds up.
More people write, more and better.
- Four lines on Twitter isn't...
- Why not?
Like under the Ancien Régime.
People sharing witticisms.
It's very French.
Nothing new.
Just more people
spreading witticisms further.
And unwitty witticisms!
And lousy jokes.
Nothing new about it.
Flatters narcissism.
Yep.
These are narcissistic times.
What can we do?
We disconnect
from art and artists.
You're no less narcissistic.
We all are.
I don't know
what you mean by that.
I reject this materialistic society.
Its obsession with money,
the body, clothes.
Stop oversimplifying.
Your radicality is no less narcissistic.
You know how I live.
Without my wife,
I'd be on welfare.
I can't judge the world?
You can judge it.
I'm just saying this radicality
is also narcissism.
It's the most valuable commodity.
You want to take that, too?
Do and think as you please.
So will I.
That's unlike you.
Shall we have lunch?
Pamela...
What a madhouse.
- Can't complain.
- Rush hour.
- The Thai is closed.
- That's why.
- Can we sit?
- Go right ahead.
Have a seat.
Get your quarterlies?
Foundation is still selling.
It's been ten years, nice and steady.
Paperback, too.
The others keep stagnating.
Stagnating pretty low.
- Hushed...
- ...Farewells.
Hushed Farewells, yes.
It wasn't exactly a chart-buster.
We didn't kill many trees.
A worst-seller, as they say.
It happens.
I saw your ex-wife.
What's her name?
Solange.
Solange, right.
In Farewells, what's her name?
Véronique.
Véronique Pastoureau.
- She said she was sick.
- Yes, it seems pretty serious.
- You see each other?
- No, she's the one who left.
She feels bad about it.
I don't know.
Probably, yes.
It was very painful for me, so...
I don't want to backtrack.
I felt very sorry for her,
since we've been
through a lot together.
Barcelona book fair,
when she got dead drunk.
Alain, I don't want to talk about it.
I understand.
How's Valerie?
Fine...
Still works for that politician.
- David?
- Yes.
Constantly travelling.
Tell her I share David's views...
Very courageous.
Especially on cultural policy
for Europe.
I'll tell her.
She'll tell him for sure.
He'll be happy to hear it, I guess.
Here you go.
Today's special is veal stew.
I'll have the usual.
- Entrecôte rare, salad and still water.
- Perfect.
- No appetizer?
- No.
But be my guest.
All right.
I'll have...
a terrine, please, and then...
- turbot aioli.
- Turbot. Perfect.
- No wine?
- No, thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen.
So...
Valerie is sort of her. Oriane.
And Xenia is Stephanie Volkowski.
She has that talk-show on Channel 8.
In the manuscript.
Which maybe you read.
Yes, I did.
I wanted to talk about it.
We're here to discuss it.
I liked it.
Same vein as your recent work.
I feel there's sort of an arc.
It forced itself on me.
The scene where they meet by chance
in the BHV hardware department.
- It's not made up.
- I figured. It's moving.
And since it's told in snippets...
Is it her talking
or what you fear she might say?
It's what she should have told me...
if she'd been...
more lucid, or...
It's not "lucid" I meant...
- More honest?
- No.
More...
If she'd been more cruel.
It's harsh... but true.
Didn't you write a BHV scene before?
Yes, in... Police Report.
Right... It was recent.
Eight years ago.
Not so recent.
I was discussing it with Constance,
our new publicist.
She loves Police Report.
One of her favourites.
See? You weren't sold on it
back then.
It's aged well.
Constance was asking
why you didn't follow up in that vein.
I did it, so why do it again?
Not do it again, but... extend it.
Would you have liked me...
to write something along those lines?
No. No, no, no...
- You have doubts?
- No.
Questions?
Questions...
I mean, questions...
about myself.
Nothing about your text.
It's sort of my text.
No, your text triggers
a thought process
that goes beyond your text.
How so?
I just wonder if...
in terms of our times,
we're not both cut off
from what's happening
or from what should happen.
When we write and publish books,
we're out of phase with the times.
The terrine...
That's for me.
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.
- Thanks for lunch.
- Sorry, my pleasure.
If anything here interests you...
I already browsed.
Not much in there for me.
I'm off.
See you soon.
I'd like that.
- Otherwise...
- Yes?
About my manuscript...
- What?
- Is it scheduled?
I don't get it.
A release date.
You're publishing it...
No, I'm not.
I thought you understood.
Everyone's here.
- Sorry I'm late.
- As usual.
- I had to meet with Laure.
- Laure?
Laure d'Angerville.
I mentioned her.
Head of digital transition.
Oh, yes.
Brilliant business-school grad,
sexual-predator style.
That's her.
Nowadays it's simple.
More people read my blog than my books.
Don't complain.
Your book's doing well.
Stacks of Be Honest With Me
at the superstore!
It's a big hit.
We'll do an audiobook.
They sell very well.
Maybe Catherine Deneuve.
- I'm in.
- Dream on.
Who knows?
I hear she's nice.
- My blog gets 5,000 hits a day.
- A day?
- Jesus!
- What do you discuss?
News.
Not literary news.
What concerns me.
What concerns people day by day.
But they read me.
And more online than on paper.
Don't forget it's free.
- People love free stuff.
- There's a recession. It's normal.
They want art for free.
Not computers.
Meaning?
No one has a problem
spending 1,500 on a computer
plus the cost of an internet provider,
recession or not.
But buying music or books or even a paper
is a major problem.
Books are pirated much less.
No comparison.
Because young people read less,
that's all.
The real pirates
are internet providers,
selling content that's not theirs.
People say art is corrupt, thus worthless,
so it should be free.
Many good people agree.
And many good people disagree.
It's too easy to hide
behind modern art theory
to download Fast and Furious.
- You're oversimplifying.
- Fuck you!
Please.
- Can someone help me?
- Coming.
Just take the pastries.
Over there.
Like information. It should be free
because it's deemed fake.
Paying would buy it respect.
It's distorted by the power of lobbies
or journalists' conformism.
It's delegitimised.
Whereas the craziest rumours
validated by self-proclaimed experts
are swallowed whole.
I hear that over and over.
Internet didn't invent rumours.
Governments always exploited them.
We learn to think to avoid that.
That's what books are for.
But we learn less and less.
It's a constantly mutating virus.
Writing will dematerialise.
It's a fact.
Look.
You read manuscripts on tablets.
Not all of them.
I never do.
Not your generation.
Not your education.
No offense!
New generations grow up
with computers. It's different.
- Bottom line, they read less.
- Wrong!
More and more blogs!
- Just more and more bloggers.
- With time to waste.
- But not for the kids.
- I disagree.
We write more than before.
Internet has freed speech.
What speech?
Some incontinent flow?
Thank you.
I don't mean your blog.
Of course not.
Which I don't read,
but I do read your books.
You're the minority.
Because my blog is read,
some of its readers buy my books.
Hence the success
Alain was crowing about.
Your books do great on Kindle.
Check the figures.
It's the elderly who read.
Roughly speaking, retirees.
Among them, mostly women.
They switched to e-readers.
They're more convenient.
easier, lighter, handier.
Bigger letters.
When you travel,
you can take your whole library.
Why my whole library?
I take a book.
It's lighter than an e-reader.
- No recharging.
- Right.
Don't be dishonest. This is real.
We'll read fewer books
and they'll be on e-readers.
No more vodka for her.
I have a question.
Why not go full digital?
It makes no sense.
Truth is, books still sell.
Less, but they sell.
- It works.
- Not for long.
No more intermediaries -
distributors, bookstores, printers.
Just publishers and writers.
A publishing house becomes a website.
Call it a website.
It does the same editing on manuscripts,
same follow-up, same standards.
- It's demeaning.
- For you.
Not for people used to electronic books.
E-books? All right...
What's so funny?
All we do is
lose the fabrication process.
Same deals, same authors.
- My blog could be on your site.
- Exactly.
We do the same exact thing as now.
Maybe better
because we focus on essentials.
No packaging, no logistics.
- So you fire people.
- Not at all.
We'll part with some, hire others.
No fewer posts.
- Literary prizes will be voted for online.
- And sent by email.
Why not by Amazon? Prime!
And you'll meet readers
via video-conference.
We already do.
No one will ever leave home.
How depressing.
We're at a tipping point.
Adorno on iPad or in a first edition
on vellum paper
won't change what we get from him.
I doubt there are first editions
of Adorno on vellum paper.
You never read him.
It's a figure of speech.
I agree. We can peacefully
leave books behind.
There are glasses over there...
They wandered off.
I had lunch with Leonard.
It was painful.
It's always painful.
This time even more.
I read his manuscript.
What's it about?
More of the same.
His affairs.
Pretty repetitive. Pretty sordid, too.
Recent affairs?
Recent ones, yes.
You didn't like it?
I have major issues.
I think he's a good writer.
- It's an extension of the last one.
- It wasn't bad.
I struggled through it.
Under the cynicism
there's a human being, sort of.
I turned it down.
I need your advice.
That's unusual.
I was offered season 4 of Collusion.
A fourth season?
It's doing very well.
It gets great press.
Series always get great press.
Why hesitate?
Sick of playing a cop?
Not a cop.
She's a crisis management expert.
It's...
It's wearing on me.
I'm going nowhere.
So stop.
But they can't replace me.
I feel like a hostage.
If you have no choice, do it.
If I say yes,
it'll be another six months.
What are you up to?
I had a bad dream.
Why are you here?
Where's your bed? Where is it?
Where's your bed?
Over there.
- Over there?
- A nightmare?
Or a dream about sleeping
with Mum and Dad?
Little rascal!
Go on, hide.
Hide!
- Back to bed.
- He'll read you a story.
Again!
What's wrong?
Nothing.
All right...
I had lunch with Alain yesterday.
Is Alain doing well?
He seems fine.
- Good. He seemed down the other day.
- Oh, yeah?
"Down" how?
Down, just down. Not up.
- He's better. He seems in good shape.
- Glad to hear it.
Great shape.
Excellent.
He's turned down my manuscript.
How is Selena?
I don't know... I didn't see her.
We should have dinner with them.
I said he refused my manuscript.
Yes, I heard.
What can I do?
Stand by me.
I do stand by you.
Rework your text, make it better.
Want me to cry?
It didn't cross your mind
he may be wrong, I don't know...
or missed something.
No, I didn't think that.
He's your publisher.
So?
So it's his call.
Or change publishers.
I don't know any others.
He's published me for years.
That's what I said... Rework your text.
I've been working on it for a year.
I can't see straight.
Want me to cheer you up?
I knew it.
- So do it.
- No.
Don't you think Alain's changed?
So have you, so have I.
We all change over time.
But him for the worse.
No, for the better.
How so?
He's more reliable, more solid.
Better judgement.
Thanks a real lot.
Don't take it wrong.
Vertheuil Editions is a success.
Bestsellers, prizes.
It wasn't a given at first.
The company is over 100 years old.
They were struggling before Alain.
He senses the zeitgeist.
That's a real talent!
A merchant's talent.
He's still demanding.
Many publishers envy his catalogue.
Shit.
I have to go. Big day ahead.
We'll discuss this later.
What's the emergency?
Local elections in Mayenne.
David wants to show his support.
I saw it in the media.
Things look pretty grim.
- You're going along?
- Yes.
To meet the strikers.
The mill is in receivership.
Negotiations are at a standstill.
I took on the case.
And you're managing?
I'll finish in the train.
If we can't kick-start labour talks,
I'll lose hope.
So long.
Call Jean-Pierre?
I left two messages. No answer.
He mustn't worry.
I'll upload his text later.
- Good evening, Laure.
- Good evening.
Come in, please.
Have a seat.
Good to see you.
We don't know each other well.
It's a new position.
People don't get what I do.
Everyone knows the importance
of digital transition.
That's what scares them.
Yet I'm walking on eggshells.
In the publishing world,
digital is demonised.
We're beyond that.
Unfortunately or not, I can't say.
That's why
I'm being patient, instructive
and very humble.
That's not what we expect of you.
Lots to learn
in your revered institution.
We try hard...
not to be too revered.
- It was a compliment.
- A poisoned one.
There are things to change.
When I talk about the stakes...
for the years to come,
I feel like a prophet of doom.
You're here to shake things up.
How much?
Meaning?
What's the limit on the shakeup?
You tell me.
To go all the way,
we have to rethink it all.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Our approach needs visibility.
We're not communicating.
Any suggestions?
We have an opportunity.
Read Robert Clarence's manuscript?
I'm pretty sceptical.
A collection of texts and tweets
and what next?
He shows unexpected humour.
It's not new. It's been done.
True...
Mallarmé published occasional verse.
I wasn't thinking Mallarmé.
Including addresses.
Mr. Monet, that winter nor summer
does his vision lure
Lives, while painting, Giverny
near Vernon, in the Eure
I'm floored.
Texting is a modern form of writing.
We all do it. We all relate.
Too much maybe.
Tweets are modern-day haiku,
says Clarence.
I respect his opinion.
We can publish a book version
and an iPhone app.
Why not read Clarence on iPhone?
You're wary.
But it's a powerful image.
We've published emails.
- See?
- It's different. It's a letter.
Some people polish letters,
others don't.
Handwritten or electronic
doesn't change much.
Castelli's correspondence
included emails.
We didn't bother to mention it.
Same old patterns.
You're harsh.
Cut!
I wasn't in it.
I lost my concentration.
I got hit by a cartridge case.
Third one!
How's it going?
Same old thing.
Very physical.
- Exhausting?
- A bit.
But it's good to work on adrenaline.
Jérôme has an easier time
with bodies than ideas.
I'm getting sick of...
all this revenge stuff.
It's an excuse.
I hate revenge,
especially when it legitimises violence.
Don't like what you do?
Sure, I'm glad to do it.
I do my best, but...
It's not really satisfying.
- How are things with Alain?
- Fine.
- Problems?
- I think he's seeing someone.
- Think or know?
- I feel it.
Why not talk to him?
I'm not sure I should.
It's always better to talk.
No, it's not.
What can I do if it's true?
He'll lie.
Do I want to break up?
Is that what I want?
- You prefer hypocrisy?
- It's not hypocrisy after twenty years.
You can't keep the flame alive forever.
You'd find it normal if he cheated?
He is cheating.
- You weren't sure.
- I'd bet my life on it.
And you'll make do with it?
He doesn't love me less.
Maybe more.
How so?
He feels guilty. He knows...
he may lose me.
It scares him, brings him closer.
Doesn't sound like you.
There's more to a couple than desire.
What's the title? What's it about?
Vertheuil Editions will publish it?
I'm not sure it's for them.
It's good to start afresh.
It's important to...
We should get started. It's time.
If we start, people will come.
Good evening.
Thank you all for coming.
For being faithful
to our Friday gatherings.
There are fewer of you than usual.
But it's cold and there are problems
on the underground.
We won't keep our guest waiting.
Good evening, Leonard Spiegel.
It's a pleasure having you here
to discuss a demanding oeuvre,
still little known.
Let me ask the first question.
Hushed Farewells
is an explicitly autobiographical novel.
Yes... Yes and no.
All fiction is autobiographical.
We recognise...
- Solange.
- In the character of Véronique.
For those who know her,
it's transparent.
But for those who don't,
who's the real Solange?
What's the difference if I was inspired
by her or someone else?
In my opinion, readers will substitute...
their own memories, whimsy.
The result is a character...
as fictive as if invented from scratch.
I think.
Any questions?
Yes?
What about the controversy
over your book?
What controversy?
On the internet.
Meaning?
The blogosphere is heated,
but you have supporters.
Maybe you're unaware.
It's pretty vicious.
I haven't followed it at all.
You may be better off.
Can writers be inspired
by real-life people?
Of course,
that's what we've always done.
Try harder.
Your ex-wife posted that she felt raped.
The web was abuzz.
It's old news, just between us.
She harasses me.
She's settling scores.
Your book doesn't settle scores?
That's your opinion.
It's debatable.
Indeed, one can argue
each individual owns his image.
To trade on it or not.
So this is about money?
My life has a value.
You use it, you pay.
I hear you.
But my life
is my interactions with others.
Subjective, if you like.
Can't I use it, to tell what I know?
Open to discussion.
No obvious answer.
What if someone disagrees,
like your ex-wife?
What if she wants
to make use of her story?
- Seriously, she's free to!
- Not at all.
Now that you've used it,
it's second hand.
Images have a market value.
- Not commercial value.
- Yes!
The proof... is your book.
It's on sale. It has a price.
Lives have a price.
She can hold you accountable.
Hello.
- Miss d'Angerville...
- Thank you.
Room 21.
Mr Danielson, I assume?
- Room 10, first floor.
- Thank you.
Hello.
- I'm Blaise.
- Pleasure.
We're thrilled you came.
Thanks for having us.
This is Laure,
our head of digital transition.
- We've exchanged messages.
- On machines.
We can sit there.
Can I take this?
- Drinks?
- I'll have a beer.
A beer would be great.
Two beers, no three.
The real subject of the symposium
is how digital technology
democratises access to culture.
What's democracy got to do with it?
Everything's available to everyone.
Not everything, not everyone.
No, I mean...
digital technology raises hopes.
It's a utopia...
He's right. All books available online
from Google is a revolution.
20 million are now digitised.
The world's biggest library is virtual.
You mean Google has taken
our entire literary memory hostage
to sell user data to advertisers.
- Nothing gets done by philanthropy.
- Debatable.
Commerce, business and advertising
appropriating
the circulation of knowledge
is a modern idea I don't buy.
Publishing is commerce, too.
We can deplore it,
but I don't see how we can backtrack.
Today's world in a nutshell.
No one asks us, then it's too late.
Consulting in libraries
will be a thing of the past.
They'll stock books,
but the contents will be dematerialised.
Is that a good or a bad thing?
Good, of course.
How could it be bad?
Ask a novelist
who wants to hone a description
or refresh a memory.
Or a scientist who wants
an overview of research in his field.
You have a public library.
I saw the sign.
It's multimedia.
- They have books, CDs, DVDs.
- Does it do well?
Mostly with kids. They love to read.
Homeless people, too.
It's warm. They have Wi-Fi.
And old folk.
Because there's a seed-swap.
What's a seed-swap?
There are wood crates
and people come to exchange seeds.
But soon enough,
they'll serve no purpose.
They'll be reconverted.
It's inescapable.
- I have to get going.
- Stay.
We're having breakfast with Blaise.
I've been thinking... I disagree.
About what?
Know the Bergman film,
Winter Light?
I've never seen a Bergman.
Recommend that one?
A pastor has lost his faith...
but still holds services
in an empty church.
- You're the pastor?
- No.
And the church isn't exactly empty.
I don't get it.
It's about faith.
That's where we disagree.
I still don't get it.
It's not about religion.
We devote our lives to an idea, books,
but the idea overtakes us.
Not necessarily.
On the contrary, we question it.
It morphs. We try to surpass it.
- What's funny?
- Your one-track digital mind.
Digital technology
takes us out of our comfort zone.
To reinvent ourselves.
It's a challenge.
I'm not talking about what changes,
but about what stays the same.
We're also custodians of an idea
that travels through time.
Even when we doubt
and the church is empty.
I knew it. You're the pastor.
It's just an image.
Believing in an idea
despite evidence to the contrary.
That's what you'll tell them?
I'll talk about what interests them.
How digital publishing
is now a major part of our jobs.
And soon the only one.
Stay with your certitudes.
Thank you, Alain Danielson.
You challenge many preconceived ideas
in the publishing world.
We're talking about the future,
so it's speculation.
But they're questions we can't avoid.
They must also raise questions
in our audience.
Yes, Monsieur?
Yes. Sorry to be petty.
Isn't it about money?
Books are too expensive.
Don't be sorry.
E-books are half the price.
It's a big difference for retirees.
It's true that virtual books
cost nothing to make, but...
is that really the problem?
It's definitely part of it.
Our society respects
only money and power.
The more books cost,
the more respect they'll get.
That's paradoxical.
You can't both democratise books
and have prohibitive prices.
Who told you I was for democratisation?
Just kidding.
But glamorising books more
wouldn't be bad.
What about the espresso book machine?
I'll translate for non-specialists.
They're machines
for printing books on demand.
To be installed in bookstores.
You choose a book on a screen,
press a button,
and it's printed.
It takes five minutes.
Identical to a book off the press.
"Identical" is pushing it.
The nostalgia of bibliophiles?
In the United States,
well-crafted hardbacks sell well.
Once sold out,
it comes out in paperback.
Stop!
Let me go!
Let me go. I'll be late.
No, you're crazy.
Stop.
Leonard?
Over there.
I read your book.
Took you long enough.
You're pushing it.
You really think I'm like Xenia?
Xenia is a fictional character.
A pretty transparent one, I think.
If you know me, it's easy to see.
It went right over Alain's head.
What did you tell him?
I hinted, very discreetly,
that I was inspired
by Stephanie Volkowski.
- Stephanie?
- To cover my tracks!
I remind you of Stephanie?
No, her name just popped into my head.
You like her sleazy talk-show?
Not at all.
- Neither do I.
- Alain knows I had a fling with her.
Nothing to brag about!
It's a lot more credible
than if I'd said Taylor Swift.
She's more flattering!
And you took other liberties
with the facts.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.
Like what?
The blowjob in the cinema.
Didn't that happen?
Not really.
Remember, it was during
Star Wars: the Force Awakens.
I changed the title of the film!
Haneke's White Ribbon is more chic!
- I fictionalised.
- I'll say!
Like the weekend in Seville?
During Holy Week?
- Yes!
- That's made up.
It was the book fair... in Brive.
Seville is more glamourous.
Better storytelling.
I thought you hated storytelling.
No, I think I'm walking that back.
Step by step, I'm walking it back.
Want to have a smoke?
- Seville was with someone else?
- Never been.
It's all Wikipedia, Google.
Sounds real, right?
I like it when they miss
the Penitents March
and spend the day
in the Alcazar gardens.
I hear they're beautiful.
We can go to Seville.
Whenever you want.
Sure Alain didn't guess?
I'm positive.
But he won't publish it.
That's a bit discouraging.
I like it.
One of your better books.
Did you tell him?
Yes, yes.
Any effect?
No.
None. He barely reacted.
Is he taking revenge?
Think he knows something?
No, I don't know... no, nothing at all.
Consciously or unconsciously
he may suspect.
- So for unconscious reasons...
- Active ones!
- He won't publish me.
- Something like that.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Yes, thank you.
Valerie, how are you?
- I'm late.
- We gave up on you.
I just got in from Laval.
Let me take your stuff.
Hello, everyone. How are you?
Sorry I'm late.
I just got in from Laval.
- I kept calling.
- I ran out of battery.
- Both phones?
- Yes!
Charge them in a café!
- I can charge one.
- I'd appreciate it.
Thank you.
Excuse me... Where is Laval?
It's in Mayenne, for your info.
Sorry to be ignorant,
but where's Mayenne?
Is that a joke?
You must be kidding.
East? West? I'm serious...
In the Massif Central.
That's Pierre Laval,
Vichy Prime Minister from Massif Central.
Shame on you! Laval.
It's in the Pays de la Loire.
90 minutes by TGV.
Ever heard of TGVs?
I never took a TGV. Never!
Cheer up!
I need one.
To all of you!
And here's to The Swamp.
I found it interesting.
The mix of fiction and reality.
So? Did it go well?
Thanks for asking.
It was a disaster.
The steel mill owner is a brute.
The conflict got worse.
It'll be bad for the election.
- But good for David's image.
- Meaning?
Defending the strikers
makes his image less bland.
It's no image. He's a socialist.
It's why he's in politics.
He's in politics to get elected.
Sure! Stop agreeing!
Sure he's in it to get elected.
It's obvious. Why else?
To lose?
Obviously he wants to win.
To get elected, you manage your image.
He's good at that.
He has convictions.
And he lets them be known.
He communicates.
A picture with strikers helps.
You're so cynical.
It's ready.
We can't do politics as usual.
It's a new era.
So what do we do?
Change the software.
The software's always the same: reality.
Taxes, work, school, security.
- It's more complicated.
- It's simple.
There's real and perceived temperature.
Real and perceived are different things.
We need to work on both.
But what drives the perceived?
Information.
A vague mood.
Information no longer exists.
It does. You can't say that.
Just a supermarket of information.
Everyone does his own shopping
with his own cart.
Internet is more than that.
We choose where we shop.
We choose what we read
to validate our opinions.
We can be demanding choosing sources.
I've always filtered mine.
We can recycle.
People usually know how to recycle.
What's so funny?
A stupid joke.
A friend sent me the poster
of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Share it with us.
It's not interesting.
It's hard to explain.
One device-free night, please.
I'm turning it off.
Can I steal one from you?
- They're slims.
- Fine.
You don't mind?
I agree with Valerie.
Politics is boots on the ground.
Not only.
But that's where you have to start.
You need concrete results
on that ground of yours.
When? Right away?
Yes, right away.
But politics takes time.
This isn't against David.
He's very commendable.
- "Commendable"...
- I like David.
But politicians' words
rarely become fact, right?
We stop believing. We lose trust.
Who's losing trust? You?
No, people.
People? What people?
Just people.
You! What do you think?
Nothing. I'm taking note.
You think nothing.
That's way too easy.
I'm cold.
Public opinion
plays out day by day.
The frontline is all the spin you hate.
In real time.
So it's no holds barred?
We call it post-truth.
We've been in post-truth for a while.
What do you call post-truth?
People living in a fictional world
ruled by their prejudices.
They're not that naive!
We all need certitudes
in an uncertain world.
Don't they see through the spin?
I think they X-ray everything
in the sharpest way.
You're an optimist.
Not at all.
I think this lucidity serves
no purpose whatsoever.
They exhausted me big time.
Why?
It was really nice.
You found that nice?
It was anything but!
All night long
bitching about politics and David.
- Some water?
- I'd love some.
Don't be so thin-skinned.
It wasn't mean.
- It was insidious and sneaky.
- Mostly Carsten.
- The others, too.
- Much less.
Maybe.
I like Carsten.
He's a little grumpy,
but his book The Swamp
isn't irrelevant. It's good.
Alain hates it.
He didn't want to publish it.
It's selling like hotcakes.
Now he thinks he can spout off.
I don't agree at all.
He knows the world of politics.
- Admit it.
- He was a talk-radio pundit.
He's been on the ground.
Stop talking about the ground!
No, he hasn't. Best case,
he knows people who have.
You took it badly.
Yes, I did.
Why would I take it well?
I do a tough job as best as I can
and get insulted!
No one's insulting you.
Did you hear their tone?
How they spoke to me?
That contempt of politics?
That's how people talk nowadays...
But that's no reason.
- Stay here.
- Stop it, please.
Let go.
It wasn't against you.
More about David.
I know. All the more so.
- You know David.
- Sure I do.
What do you think of him?
I find him hard-working.
I find him honest. I find him...
- Involved.
- We agree on that.
But voting for him
isn't much of a turn-on.
You vote to get turned on?
- No.
- So?
I think he's a good guy.
But besides the sympathy
I feel for him,
he doesn't exactly embody my politics.
Who embodies them?
I don't know...
- Genghis Kahn, yes.
- Really?
Attila the Hun, yes.
Atilla the Hun?
Jack the Ripper!
Better!
Jack the Ripper, for sure.
Him for sure.
I was never a supporter
of law and order.
You prefer disorder.
I have a poor relationship
to authority.
What's the opposite of authority?
Chaos.
Chaos is better. You prefer it.
Theoretically, yes.
It's more productive.
"Theoretically, yes..."
Practically,
I don't think it works that well.
Are you cheating on me?
Why do you say that?
It popped into my head earlier.
I didn't want to hold it in.
- When?
- When you got that text message.
That's nonsense.
The way you smiled.
- What way?
- And you deleted it immediately.
I did it automatically.
Spare me.
- You're insinuating...
- Do you love me?
Yes.
Because I love you.
I really do.
Even...
- Even though we never agree...
- Because we agree on nothing.
What a pleasure!
It wasn't too hard to find?
The signs aren't clear.
- We have GPS.
- How are you?
We've missed you.
We found this on the way.
It may not be any good.
The shop I know was closed.
It's the thought that counts.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Guy Fonville, Alain Danielson.
- We met at Science-Po?
- Two years apart.
Selena needs no introduction.
I saw you in Season 2 of Collision.
- What's Collision?
- You don't know it?
An amazing series.
You'd love it.
Collusion, not Collision.
Collusion, that's it.
Collusion.
Much better title.
I'm totally hooked.
Riveting.
We're kept in suspense.
It has nothing to envy American series.
Not too hard, playing a policewoman?
Not a policewoman, but...
a crisis management expert.
It's a very physical part.
Strong woman.
It's nice to act with your body.
It's interesting to play
a character over time.
And now...
people stop me in the street.
- More than before?
- No comparison.
Lars Noren at the Odeon
didn't hit the mainstream.
Selena, some coffee?
And you, Alain?
See the match?
No. Were you there?
I was so pissed off.
- Penalty kick after five minutes.
- Then fuck-up after fuck-up.
Out on their feet!
Know who Xavier Dehoux is?
Telecom guy.
Lots of other stuff, too.
He's very likeable.
- Big indie rock fan.
- Really?
He has an unusual career path.
Started with telephone chat rooms,
moved onto dating sites.
I read his profile in the paper.
He wants to develop a media division.
He needs content.
For mobile phones?
He's sitting on a big war chest.
He's looking for a new acquisition.
Are you selling?
Publishing isn't very high-growth.
It's not losing money either.
We said three years to reach our target.
Did we reach it? No...
You know the figures. No, but...
we'll make it. We're on track.
My shareholders want profits,
not tracks.
It's prestige.
Prestige has value if you turn a profit.
Not my case.
So why invest in publishing?
E-books were supposed to take off.
According to all the analysts.
You first.
- They said it was the future.
- It will be.
But the opposite's happening.
Sales in free-fall.
Down 15% last year.
According to American stats.
15% is a lot.
It's a real trend.
Due to what?
Prices up, readership down.
Still cheaper than books.
Perhaps, but...
we've reached a tipping point.
But you know what?
Book sales are up!
It's inconsistent.
Reading habits change quickly.
What's really taking off
is the audio-book.
I've seen that.
Audio-books read by stars.
Exactly. Read by stars.
We read more and more on tablets,
- on smartphones, less on e-readers.
- Smartphones?
It's wild!
People read books on smartphones!
And so, the synergy with telecom.
- Exactly.
- And Dehoux's offer?
Market-wise,
he needs to make a statement.
It's time to sell.
Sell Vertheuil Editions?
I'm tempted, old chap...
I'd be able to exit with my head high
and turn a considerable profit.
I wanted to ask you first.
What do you think?
- About selling?
- No.
E-books.
Is there any potential at all, or...
are they done?
Selena read
Leonard Spiegel's manuscript.
Really? It's news to me.
She says it's one of his best.
Yes, that's what I think.
I liked Foundation.
That was ages ago.
Police Report, too.
We didn't sell many.
What's the title?
I can't remember.
Full Stop.
That's it. Full Stop...
- What did he want?
- To sell.
You get sold with the furniture?
New owner, new strategy.
I don't see myself staying.
His mind is made up?
No, he's negotiating...
with Dehoux.
Dehoux? What's Dehoux?
Forget it.
Opaque financier,
big digital fortune.
You said the future of publishing
was full digital.
Figures say the opposite now.
Make up your mind.
You played your cards well. Bravo.
What cards?
Leonard's book, of course.
I'm not forcing you.
Can't I say I like it?
I'm not arguing.
Why won't you publish it?
Why do you want me to?
Honestly?
No need to be honest.
He puts himself on the line.
For the first time.
Always the same navel-gazing.
It's more than that.
Pump number 5.
This, too.
That, too.
Dragging himself in the mud
authorises him to drag others.
- I'm fed up.
- Less in this one.
Can you turn the light on?
Where's Martin?
He's at my mum's.
When is she bringing him back?
I don't know.
They went to an amusement park.
Will he have time for homework?
Their bus must be stuck in traffic.
Not so loud!
It's hurting my ears.
Sorry.
Leonard's floundering.
I hate floundering with him.
- A new publisher may do him good.
- You're wrong.
He sets himself free
and you drop him.
The book will be liked.
What makes you say that?
You can't see.
You have no perspective.
It's your relationship that's worn out.
I hate his view of women.
What bothers you?
Who's that girl
with the talk show on Channel 8?
Stephanie.
Stephanie Volkowski, right.
He slept with her.
Common knowledge.
What about it?
We recognise her right away.
With another name.
- Xenia?
- It's transparent.
I didn't think of her at all.
You're the only one.
So? It concerns ten people
looking for keys to nothing.
How about some tea?
- I'd love some.
- OK.
The White Ribbon scene
didn't bother you?
- Excellent film.
- We saw it together.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
It's very crude.
What they do?
His complacent description.
So what?
Embarrassing for her, isn't it?
That's your issue?
Like the Turkish bath scene
in Seville.
What's the problem?
He objectifies her.
Maybe she likes it?
That's what he hints at.
I have a problem with that.
The question is,
is it good literature?
Yes...
Sorry, I feel uneasy
for Stephanie Volkowski.
Off the subject!
I see her show and think
White Ribbon.
Stop!
It disturbs me.
Stop, Alain.
Now I have no choice
but to publish it.
Do as you please.
It's the first time that Marc-Antoine
has shown interest in a book.
His girlfriend is the fan.
Same thing.
I agree with you.
I haven't persuaded Alain yet.
Take care.
Can I have my key?
Haven't changed your mind?
It's over.
Because of Alain?
I read your texts.
Since when?
Since always.
- Want one?
- No, I want nothing.
It's not Alain.
A little.
I thought you prefer girls.
I do.
But not only.
Is it serious with Alain?
It'll wear off.
On both sides.
But we'll stay friends.
You won't stay with him?
He's married with a kid.
He doesn't intend to leave them.
It's fine like that.
I'm leaving anyway.
For where?
It's confidential.
I met a head-hunter.
Tempting offer.
Head of marketing for a media group.
All of Europe.
- Where will you be based?
- London.
I used to live there.
Thank you, sir.
Have a nice evening.
I saw your report
on the future of literary criticism.
Did you read it?
I leafed through it...
Not too optimistic.
It's factual, stuff I found online.
Take what you like.
Toss the rest.
Is that the trend?
The role of critic as trendsetter
has weakened.
We must be fast and pro-active.
Same rate
as newspapers losing readers?
But they usually switch
to digital editions.
Or to blogs.
What's new, then?
You write differently for the net.
For instance,
you optimise the use of keywords.
To get indexed better
by the robots.
Sorry... what robots?
They manage info flows
for search engines.
And you'll test titles' virality.
If it's not viral, you change it.
Of course.
Where are you heading?
Indexed, viral or not,
critics remain trend-setting.
To a certain extent.
Their subjectivity
isn't that of your targets.
- I have no targets.
- You do.
You publish books to sell them.
You want to target their audience.
That's not my approach.
It has been for a while.
Zero in on your audience
rather than pampering critics.
No need for a middleman's subjectivity.
Now we have algorithms.
Thank you.
What do they tell me?
They process your personal data.
If you bought nappies last week,
planned a trip to Israel,
saw an Indonesian film on Arte
or streamed Dany Boon.
- Googled a gay icon...
- I get it.
They target you, anticipate your tastes.
You're predictable.
Look at your Amazon recommendations.
It works.
Soon we'll put more trust
in algorithms based on consumer habits,
than in smug critics.
You're harsh.
All positions of authority
are now being questioned.
Algorithms won't fuel the conversation.
Analysis, reflection, art history...
That's different.
We'll always have opinion blogs for that.
I'm talking sales.
Sales-wise,
it's never a done deal.
- Never.
- Surveys say otherwise.
What do they say?
That CD buyers, moviegoers, readers
react to likes
or links of opinion leaders
on Twitter, or Facebook friends.
You know that most of those likes
are generated by paid hackers.
Still, they play on network habits
that tap into modern sensibilities.
Is this good?
I have no opinion.
- Stopping by the office?
- To get my stuff. You?
I left my car keys there.
This was on my desk.
- A gift.
- For what?
- You know.
- No.
- A farewell present.
- Why farewell?
Because you're leaving.
How do you know?
I know.
For a while?
In real time.
You know Emeline Rittenberg?
My replacement?
I'm awaiting her answer.
She's very ambitious.
She likes money mostly.
- She'll get more than me?
- Yes.
I don't like money enough?
You have other interests.
Besides sex?
Besides sex, I don't know.
Power.
- Not true.
- It's debatable.
Publishing, in your own way.
Otherwise you'd do something
that pays better.
You're more attached to literature
than you let on.
My father was a novelist.
I've read his poems, too.
I didn't know.
I like them a lot.
I had other offers.
I thought I'd be useful here.
At what?
Joining the discussion
on 21st-century publishing.
Its reinvention.
Does it need to be reinvented?
It's going to change.
Structurally.
I'm less convinced than you.
Everything will change.
But we must choose the change,
not suffer it.
Remember what Prince Salina says
at the end of The Leopard?
Of course.
Everything must change
for things to stay as they are.
Exactly.
What an odd quote.
- Why?
- Everyone uses it now.
Thanks. I didn't know
you were such a boor.
It's not against you.
It resonates more now
than half a century ago
when Lampedusa wrote it.
Because it's about
the end of a world?
Maybe we have more reasons
to be concerned.
I'll have a coffee with milk.
And a glass of water.
Thanks for coming near me.
Sorry, with our shooting schedule...
at dawn.
No problem.
Double espresso and orange juice.
I brought you the book.
I got it last night.
I wrote something for you.
"For you, Selena..."
How nice.
Full Stop. Ballsy title.
Why?
Sounds like your last novel.
Thanks a lot.
What are you doing?
- Knocking on wood.
- That's not wood.
What is it?
Some sort of Fablon,
but not wood.
Like Thomas Bernhard,
who wrote Extinction and then died.
You really decided to crush me good.
Just kidding.
Not in the best taste.
You should have said so earlier.
Now that I see it in print...
You don't answer my messages.
No.
So... what should I infer?
That's up to you.
You're involved with your show.
You have no time...
It's not a matter of time.
It's a matter of...
fatigue.
Fatigue?
How long have we been together?
"Together" is overstating it.
We've been having an affair that's...
pretty deconstructed.
Six years.
- Who'd have guessed?
- Do the maths.
- No ice in the orange juice.
- OK.
All ice, no juice.
So you won't come with me to Naples?
As they say,
feelings are always mutual.
If I don't come, it's because...
you don't really want me to.
You're trying to say it's over.
I think I'm doing more than trying.
Give me a little time...
- Let's go about it well.
- It's a done thing.
We're putting it into words.
I have no time to talk it out.
I'm in a rush.
We're shooting in the suburbs.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
That was the emergency?
Not exactly.
I wanted... I wanted to ask you
something specific.
Not to turn it into a book.
No, no...
Tempting as it may seem.
I won't.
I'd never forgive you.
I promise.
I won't save it,
like the last one.
I promise, I won't do it.
I'll destroy you.
Yes, I can imagine.
Your life will be hell.
I think I got the message.
- Shall I repeat it?
- No, no, it's fine. Message received.
Want to share an Uber?
I'm going to Bastille.
I'll finish my coffee.
I have a radio interview later.
We have a lot of public shows.
Morning news after elections...
Talk shows...
Le Masque et la Plume.
Concerts on Mouv' and FIP.
And France Inter, too.
I'll be back two minutes
before you're on.
- Need anything else?
- We'll be fine. Thank you.
I'll give you a little recap.
It's not much yet, but it'll start soon.
You OK?
- Something wrong?
- Nope.
The columnist from Version Femina
liked it a lot.
Version Femina?
More readers than you think.
Very popular blogger.
I'm waiting to hear from Pierre Schultz.
Forget it, he hates me.
I gave him your book. He was happy.
He even said, "Great title, Full Stop."
He asked how you were.
We chatted...
Never a good review
and I know him from high school.
But...
For Police Report...
I thought he wrote a good review.
- Did you read it?
- Eight years ago I was still at university.
He's a rattlesnake.
You're almost on. Follow me.
Sit at the yellow mike.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello. Today we're here
with Leonard Spiegel,
author of Foundation,
Hushed Farewells...
here with his new novel, Full Stop.
Is it really a novel, Leonard Spiegel?
I lay claim to the word "novel".
Novel, OK.
But isn't it auto-fiction, too?
People use that word.
I'm not sure what it means.
Let's try to clarify.
The narrator is named Leonard.
He's a novelist.
Same neighbourhood,
same apartment...
If we're familiar with you,
we see pieces of your life.
It's more complex than that.
And yet it's transparent.
We were wondering...
Michael Haneke...
He may not be amused
by the hot scene...
During The White Ribbon.
It's very unsettling.
It's just for a laugh.
That's the point.
To each his own humour.
But during a film on rising Nazism?
Shouldn't we feel queasy?
Leonard Spiegel...
Let's get back to auto-fiction.
Can you sum up The White Ribbon?
I'd be glad to.
Go ahead.
Just broadly.
It's a film about Germany...
before the war...
A costume drama.
There are a few tweets,
kind of favourable.
Show me.
Not all.
No, not all.
But not many people tune in now.
- It'll be replayed.
- Yes, hello?
I heard it. I thought he was very good,
very biting.
I agree.
Definitely not smug.
- Not at all.
- Very good interviewer.
Not the softball type.
I concur... What about me?
You stuttered less than usual.
Nice surprise.
Sorry, I have a call.
It's David. I have to answer.
I have to answer.
Yes, David. I'm on the phone...
Give me a sec.
- Talk later.
- Yes.
Yes, David?
Excuse me?
I can't believe it.
No way.
No, I don't get it.
Listen... The cops?
Not over the phone.
I'll meet you there.
Honestly... What got into you?
Truth is, it's not the first time.
- You could have told me.
- Why would I?
- It gets worse?
- No.
The cops will keep quiet.
They never do.
Everything leaks.
Politicians must be transparent.
Naked in the street?
Being faultless isn't naked.
Faultless? Don't moralise.
Politicians always moralise.
You first.
- Same.
- Jack on the rocks?
Exactly what I need.
Public morality, yes.
Private life is different.
Same thing!
Not if we're consenting adults.
Concealing makes you suspicious.
- Your opinion?
- Mine doesn't matter.
Only public opinion matters.
Transparency advocates rage
if you touch their data.
They're not in politics.
As I'm devoted to public good...
No one thinks
you're in it for the public good.
They think it's to satisfy your ego,
get rich or both.
- Not true!
- But it's seen that way.
As a suspect,
be beyond reproach.
Beyond reproach means
monogamous, straight family guy.
No one's asking that much.
Many politicians are "out"
and no one cares.
Says you.
But you shouldn't get busted
leaving a hooker's camping-car.
That's off-limits!
It makes you look deplorable.
At least don't get caught.
Easier said than done.
It's a crime, subject to fine.
350 euros.
And we're back with Carine LePage.
- Hello.
- Hello.
She's the former
Secretary for the Environment.
You OK?
Not at all.
I saw David... He unnerved me.
Why?
I can't say. He unnerved me.
You've said too much
or not enough.
He unnerved me.
And I won't say why.
Don't insist, please.
Want a drink?
I already drank too much.
I have something to tell you.
You don't have to.
- Don't want to know?
- I do.
Some things are better left unspoken.
Not in a couple.
Especially in a couple.
Do you believe in concealing and...
hypocrisy?
Yes, I do.
That's not it...
I believe in the implicit.
- The implicit?
- I know, you know.
No need to get bogged down.
Strange philosophy.
You don't think so?
Better to wallow in pathos
when you can avoid it?
Listen...
I had an affair...
outside of our relationship.
And?
Nothing. I had an affair.
I know.
You wrote a book about it.
My book is auto-fiction... a novel.
Apparently not that much.
No, not that much...
You think I didn't suspect?
You never mentioned it, so...
I don't fucking believe it.
- What?
- Just forget about it.
Was it Stephanie Volkowski?
Not at all Stephanie Volkowski.
Who then?
See the limits of the implicit?
Is it someone I know?
It's Selena.
Selena?
Selena, Selena?
Yes, Selena, Selena.
There aren't many Selenas.
I'd never have thought.
But it's over.
I should believe you?
I told you this
so we could rebuild trust.
By sharing your affairs.
By stopping the lies.
You lie only to me.
The truth is in your books.
Yeah, but through a smokescreen.
- A thin one.
- I covered my tracks.
You guessed Stephanie Volkowski.
Do you realise...
That's nonsense!
What's the difference?
You can only write that stuff
from experience.
I know.
Stephanie or Selena
doesn't change a thing.
At least it's said now.
It's on the right, I know it.
It's us!
I didn't hear you pull in.
How are you?
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hi, Selena.
Hello, Valeria.
- "Valerie".
- I always forget!
Funny how you can't memorise...
I'm glad to see you.
Me too. It's been ages.
We mustn't let time go by like this.
Years whiz by, and...
It wasn't too hard to find the way?
Leonard has already been here.
He knew the way.
Once... a long time ago.
I don't remember.
You weren't here.
- Where was I?
- Japan maybe? I don't know...
Not that long ago.
- No.
- No, actually.
So... Come!
It's nice to meet up here.
Can I put this down?
Make yourself at home.
- Well-done?
- Yes, please.
Or it'll get overcooked...
- Lemon?
- Please...
- Excuse me.
- No worries.
Thank you very much.
- I'm sorry. It's a bit...
- Thank you.
- Do you want fish?
- No thanks. I've had enough to eat.
I watch you in Collusion...
I'm sick of it. I'm stopping.
I've turned down season 4.
- What will they do?
- Kill her off.
- They'll kill you?
- Yes.
How?
Her husband can't stand her...
He strangles her,
then dissolves her in acid.
No...
I have no idea!
I'm just kidding.
Such a good show. Captivating.
Aren't there enough TV cops?
She's not a cop.
She's a crisis management expert.
She's a cop, just a cop.
Yeah, but I'm hooked.
Addiction is now our default setting.
That's not what I meant.
I wouldn't say I'm an addict.
You're right.
It's what series are about.
Binge watching.
It relaxes me.
Sorry, I didn't choose this job
to relax people.
You're wrong.
They're grateful for it!
I'm not so sure.
There's a real demand
for escapist literature.
Also for sleep music...
Sure. Look how well
adult colouring books do.
Don't laugh.
We publish them and they sell.
I didn't get that.
Colouring books for adults?
After work, you relax, release stress...
- Do you want some more?
- Yes, please.
Thank you, thank you...
You release stress by colouring.
Colouring vegetable patterns,
mandalas...
Clears the head.
Is it very common?
It's a social phenomenon.
You have to be aware.
It's depressing.
It makes me feel powerless.
People also read to clear their heads.
It's a fact.
My books do the opposite.
They just make the reader feel worse.
Some people write feel-good books.
I write... let's be honest...
I write feel-bad books.
An audience for that, too.
Cakes with the coffee?
- Need a hand?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
So Selena, any new projects?
Phèdre... at La Colline Theatre.
With a Belgian director.
Wow, Phèdre!
You want to play Phèdre?
I know, it's for ageing actresses.
When you get offered Phèdre, it means...
beginning of the end.
I saw Chereau's, with Dominique Blanc.
My instinct was to run for my life.
Then I figured it's a great part.
Stupid to refuse.
Especially for the wrong reasons.
I checked on Wikipedia...
Sarah Bernhardt played her at 30...
So why not?
See the e-book of your novel?
- Is there one?
- Of course.
It's not doing badly.
Not badly...
Not bad for contemporary fiction.
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.
Can I have one sugar?
What do you mean by that?
You know, what works best on e-book
are thrillers or Harlequin romances,
like Nora Roberts.
Like who? Nora Roberts?
Who's Nora Roberts?
She's sold over 100 million books,
translated into 26 languages.
To be honest,
it's industrial literature.
So why does she sell e-books?
It's mostly for the price.
While Full Stop costs 13.99 euros...
a Nora Roberts costs 3.99 euros.
It's pretty basic.
Are you considering
an audiobook for Full Stop?
Maybe.
Sales are good. It's on the table.
- There must be a cost involved.
- You bet.
- We asked Juliette Binoche.
- Juliette Binoche?
You think she'll say yes?
I don't know. She hasn't replied.
- Selena gave it to her.
- Maybe I can write her a note, if you...
have her email?
That's not done.
But I can give you her agent's number.
To motivate her...
You've been in the papers lately.
- What papers?
- Website of Investir.
- Got a Google alert for me?
- Why?
You never read Investir.
Rumour has it
Marc-Antoine Rouvel is selling.
That's old news.
And you're on your way out.
Fake news.
Want me to explain?
I'm sort of interested...
He was going to sell
to the Dehoux group.
He's a very shady character.
I agree.
But it was a lure.
Dehoux was trying
to close on a big acquisition,
an Italian news site
he wanted to launch in France.
Vertheuil Editions was a decoy.
You follow?
It seems pretty hazy.
I get the general idea, but...
He strung Marc-Antoine along.
He wasn't buying.
He wanted the market to think he was.
While he was closing on the other deal.
So he's keeping you.
Yes, he's keeping me.
He's no longer selling.
Working on something?
I don't want to talk about it.
Is it coming along?
It's coming along very well.
You won't say more?
It's us! We're back!
Champ!
Daddy!
- How are you? Having fun?
- Yes.
Martin!
Did you swim?
How many?
No nap!
No nap?
Some fish first!
- What?
- I'm thanking you.
- For what?
- You were very tactful...
What about?
I'd rather Selena not know I'm writing.
I was afraid you'd mention it.
She doesn't know she's in it?
No, no... It's auto-fiction.
- It's Selena and not Selena.
- You'll get in trouble.
I can't write any other way.
I just can't.
There's something I wanted to say.
Something I've kept hidden.
You're having an affair?
- There's someone else?
- No.
Then I don't know.
I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant?
- Pregnant.
No, because in fact... I thought...
The gynaecologist said
we weren't compatible.
I guess we are.
You checked that...
Everything's fine.
I did ultrasounds, bloodwork.
- He's fine. Normal.
- "He"?
You said "he".
- Is it a boy? It's a boy! It is!
- No, no, no...
I asked not to know.
I don't want to know.
- How many months?
- Three.
- Three months?
- I wanted to be sure before telling you.
It's true that...
we haven't had a very active sex life.
- Not recently.
- No, not recently.
Nothing wild.
But once is enough.
When we tried IVF, it didn't work.
It's a lottery.
Yeah, but it's a lottery we lost, so...
- True.
- So it's a miracle.
No, because miracles don't happen.
This is real.
Yes, it's real.
Are you happy?
I guess I have...
to give you an honest answer.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Is the baby here or here?
More like...
Here, I think... It's tiny.
How tiny?
The size of a lentil.
NON-FICTION
