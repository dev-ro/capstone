Dinesh D'Souza: My journey to
America can be traced back
to the independence of India,
the land of my fathers.
D'Souza: Barack Obama's
journey can be traced back
to the independence of Kenya,
the land of his fathers.
Barack Obama: It's been
a long time coming,
but tonight,
at this defining moment,
change has come to America.
Brian Williams:
An African-American
has broken the barrier
as old as the republic.
A seismic shift
in American politics.
Shelby Steele: People want to be
able to tell their grandchildren
that they voted
for Barack Obama.
How many chances like that
come along in history?
He was a wave.
I just got this sense that
nothing was going to stop it.
Obama:
To those Americans
whose support
I have yet to earn,
I may not have won
your vote tonight,
but I hear your voice
and I will be
your president, too.
George Obama: The poor are getting poorer.
The rich are getting richer.
The politicians,
they grab everything.
It's us who are to blame because
we are the ones who choose them.
D'Souza: We are all
shaped by our pasts.
And we carry elements
of the past into the future.
But nothing can
threaten the future
quite as much
as the debts of the past.
D'Souza:
When I was a kid,
I would sit on the floor
of my house in Mumbai
and I would read about
the great nations,
the great empires.
The Roman Empire,
the Ottoman Empire,
the British Empire...
they all came
and they all went.
But I always thought there was
one exception to that rule,
and that's the United
States of America,
which is a different
kind of empire
if it's an empire at all.
It's an empire of ideals.
In 1978, I achieved
one of my dreams
by coming to America
to go to Dartmouth College.
I signed up for a group called
the International
Students' Association.
I liked the fact that this
group had Mexican food,
Chinese food, Indian food.
These white students, very
often, like, ponytailed guys,
would show up and they'd be,
like, sampling the food.
"Oh, Dinesh, man, really
interesting to meet you.
You know, what a name.
You know, 'Nesh."
And then they'd be like,
"India, man,
what a fascinating place, man.
I've always kind of
wanted to go,
but, you know,
never made it and stuff."
And I, you know, genuinely
would say to them
something like, "Well,
what it is about India
that's so fascinating
to you?"
"You know, it's mind-blowing.
It's just so liberating."
And I would say, "Man, what
are you talking about?
What do you mean
by 'liberating'?
Are you talking about,
like, dowry,
arranged marriage,
the caste system... what?"
I sometimes wonder what my
life would have been like
if I had never come to America,
if I had stayed in India.
I would have probably
lived my whole life
in a one-mile radius
of where I was born.
My destiny would,
to a large degree,
have been given to me.
So in America, my destiny
isn't given to me,
it's constructed by me.
And if I look at my life
as a writer,
a thinker, a speaker,
these are possibilities
that would have been
closed to me in India.
My education at Dartmouth
would have been incomplete
without a rebel group called
"The Dartmouth Review."
This was a group
of renegade conservatives
who started the newspaper
mainly for the purpose
of causing trouble.
You know, someone once said
to me, "You people
at 'The Dartmouth Review'
are sophomoric."
And we would then say, "Well,
yeah, but we're sophomores."
One of the things
I really love about America
is that this is a place
where we can discuss
and debate the big issues.
I had an interesting debate
at Stanford University
in front of 2,500 people
in Memorial Auditorium
against Jesse Jackson.
And the topic was
"Is America a racist society?"
In the debate I said,
"Reverend Jackson, look,
racism is a reality.
And in a big country,
I'm quite convinced
we can find examples of it.
But show me a racism today
that is strong enough
that it will prevent me or you
or my daughter or your children
from achieving
the American dream.
Where's that kind of racism?
Show it to me."
And he gives an amazing answer.
He says, "I can't
show it to you, Dinesh,
but that's not because
the racism isn't there...
it's because
it's gone underground.
The racism used to be overt.
It is now covert.
And so this subtle,
invisible racism
is even worse than
the old type of racism,
because the old type of racism
was at least on the surface.
You could deal with it."
"Here you are,
Reverend Jackson,
and you are
the same color as me.
If we both put our hands up
and someone took a photograph
of only our hands,
they could not tell
the difference.
And yet we see
the same America...
it's like watching an accident
and we both give a totally
different description.
And it occurred to me
I'm an immigrant
and you are the leader of an
indigenous minority group.
An immigrant is coming
from another country.
And so, by that
comparative standard,
America looked fabulous.
( whistling )
You're comparing America
to its own highest ideals.
America is falling short.
But don't you realize
that in criticizing America
for falling short
of that standard,
you're actually kind of conceding
America's moral superiority?"
I was part of the Reagan generation,
and a lot of young guys...
and a bunch of us from Dartmouth...
all came to Washington
to be part of the Reagan thing.
I worked for a magazine,
"Policy Review,"
for a couple of years
when the White House said,
"We'd like
to offer you a job."
And I said, "Wow,
I'm incredibly honored,
but I don't think I can do it
because I'm not a US citizen."
And these three or four
guys looked at each other,
and one of them said,
"Well," he said,
"what we're concerned about
is are you a Reaganite."
Four weeks later, I was
working in the White House.
I became fascinated by Reagan
because he was
such an unlikely guy.
He didn't seem even like
that serious of a guy.
This guy was nevertheless
running against the huge idea
of the 20th century...
collectivism,
which from Reagan's
point of view
was an expanding
welfare state at home
and a Soviet Empire
growing abroad.
And I think Reagan,
if you understand him,
in one shot,
was trying to block both.
I saw Reagan transform
the country firsthand.
In 1980, the US
was in a tough spot...
a horrible economy,
unrest in the Middle East,
a lot of the similar issues
we face today.
The question was could we find
another transformational leader
to solve these issues?
( crowd chanting )
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!
Yes, we can!
Yes, we can!
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!
( applause )
D'Souza: People voted
for Obama on the basis
of what they hoped he would do.
Just like the rest
of the country,
I was intrigued by Obama.
When I look
at American presidents,
most of them in their life
are totally remote from me,
no similarities.
George Bush, Bill Clinton...
totally different
life story than mine.
Obama... I get it.
We were both born
in the same year,
which is 1961.
We both went
to an Ivy League school...
in his case Columbia,
later Harvard;
in my case Dartmouth.
We got our bachelor's degree.
We graduated
the same year... '83.
We were married
in the same year... 1992.
We both have a kind of
mixed-race background.
- ( crowd cheering )
- Obama: There is not a black America
and a white America and Latino
America and Asian America,
there's the United States
of America.
D'Souza: Like most Americans,
I was introduced to Obama
through his 2004 speech
at the Democratic Convention.
- ( cheering )
- Obama: The pundits...
the pundits like to slice
and dice our country
into red states
and blue states...
red states for Republicans,
blue states for Democrats...
D'Souza: And if you
listen to that speech,
that's a speech that would
have drawn applause
at a Republican Convention.
Obama: ...federal
agents poking around...
D'Souza: The country rejected
two known politicians,
betting on the young senator
from Illinois.
This is something
we had done once before
during a desperate time.
Other presidents,
when they came to office,
were known figures,
even if their rise
was unexpected.
Now, Obama came out of nowhere.
No one really knew him.
And he came
into the White House
on the basis of promise,
of hope.
Brokaw: There's a lot
about him we don't know
because we haven't asked
enough tough questions.
Charlie Rose: But they're
questions you don't know.
I don't know what Barack
Obama's world view is.
- I really don't know.
- No, no. I don't either.
I don't know how he really sees
the whole global structure.
D'Souza: Obama is
voted in on hope.
But when we look at his
actions in the first term,
we see people
across the spectrum
say radically different
things about him.
- Obama is a radical Communist.
- I think he's a Marxist.
Anderson Cooper: Do you
believe he's a Muslim?
Do you really believe
he's a welfare thug?
I... he's certainly
acting like it.
I love our president,
but he's black and white.
He appeals to all.
I was for Obama.
I did some fund raisers
for him.
He's in a tough situation,
and I'm very disappointed
with the way some things
have gone.
I voted for him,
I donated, I worked hard.
I thought he was the one.
But now? No.
He's betrayed
virtually everything
that I got the impression
he was going to do
based on everything he said in
the run-up to the election.
D'Souza: The Federal Reserve
noted that since 2007,
Americans have lost
40% of their wealth.
If you had a $200,000 house,
it's now worth only $120,000.
That is the greatest
fall of wealth
since the Great Depression.
These are difficult
economic times,
and the country needs
a president
who can find solutions
to lead us out
of this recession.
That's why I was confused
when I saw Obama
making some really unusual
decisions in his first term,
decisions you would never see
a typical Democrat,
like Clinton, Kerry, Carter,
or even Kennedy make.
One of his first actions
was to return
a bust of Winston Churchill,
a gift from the British.
Churchill led Britain
during World War II,
helping us defeat the Nazis.
Obama is the first president
to back Argentina,
not Britain, in the dispute
over the Falkland Islands.
He delays
the Keystone Pipeline,
a project that
would have created
tens of thousands
of American jobs.
Then he blocks
oil drilling in America,
but gives billions of dollars
in taxpayer money to Brazil,
Colombia, and Mexico to drill.
He increases NASA's budget,
but lowers their horizon
from pushing for
our return to the moon
to reconciling with Muslims.
Very strange, but true.
( chanting in Arabic )
D'Souza: Then, in the Middle
East, Obama acts inexplicably.
He uses force to stop what
he calls genocide in Libya,
but refuses to stop
greater genocide in Syria.
In Egypt he supports the removal
of America's ally, Hosni Mubarak,
but he won't support
democracy protestors in Iran.
Then Obama refuses
to take meaningful action
to stop Iran from getting
nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, he slashes
America's nuclear arsenal
and plans further reductions,
leaving America vulnerable.
He takes
the Palestinian position
in negotiations with Israel,
even though Israel's been
a long-standing ally
and most Jewish Americans
traditionally are strong
Democratic supporters.
All of this
was baffling behavior.
So I was sort of
intrigued by...
what is Obama's compass?
And my way of putting it
was to ask,
"What is Obama's dream?"
Is it the American dream?
Is it Martin
Luther King's dream
or someone else's dream?
My father was
a foreign student,
born and raised in a
small village in Kenya.
- ( crowd cheering )
- Obama: He grew up herding goats,
went to school
in a tin-roof shack.
His father, my
grandfather, was a cook,
a domestic servant
to the British.
D'Souza: I realized that I
was trying to fit Obama,
as many people do,
into American history
and I was ignoring
Obama's own history.
We could guess or speculate
or conjecture about
Obama's inner compass,
his dream,
but we don't have to.
Obama himself
gives us a big clue
in the title
of his autobiography.
Notice it says
"Dreams from My Father,"
not "Dreams of My Father."
Obama: I stood before you
and told you my story,
of the brief union between
a young man from Kenya
and a young woman from Kansas.
D'Souza: I realized
that Obama's father
might be the central character
in Obama's search for identity,
in his search for who he is,
for where his deepest
aspirations and values
come from.
Barack Obama Sr.
is born near the shores
of Lake Victoria
in Kenya, Africa.
In 1952, the Mau Mau
Uprisings start in Kenya.
In 1954, he marries Kezia Aoko,
who gives birth to son Roy
and daughter Auma.
1959, he is given a scholarship
to study at
the University of Hawaii.
While here,
the 23-year-old Barack
meets 17-year-old Stanley Ann
Dunham in a Russian class.
The two are married
on February 2nd, 1961.
Stanley Ann is unaware
that he is married
and has a son and daughter
on the way in Kenya.
Then, on August 4th, 1961,
Barack Obama II
is born at the Kapi'olani
Medical Center in Honolulu.
His birth is reported
in two local newspapers.
About a year later,
Barack Sr. goes to Harvard,
leaving Ann
and young Barack behind.
In 1963, Kenya becomes
independent of Great Britain.
In 1964, Barack Sr. and Ann
officially divorce.
While at Harvard
in June of '64,
Barack Sr. meets
Ruth Beatrice Baker.
The two move back to Kenya
where she has two sons...
Okoth and Opiyo.
In 1968, Barack Sr.
is reported to have
one of two more sons
with his first wife Kezia...
Sampson and then Bernard
in 1970.
In 1971, Barack Sr. visits
his 10-year-old son in Hawaii.
This is the only time
Obama actually spent time
with his father,
although the two carried on
a correspondence
for several years before
Barack Sr.'s death in 1982.
( Obama reading )
"There was only one problem...
my father was missing.
And nothing that my mother
or grandparents could tell me
could obviate that single
unassailable fact.
Their stories didn't tell me
why he had left.
They couldn't describe what it might
have been like had he stayed."
D'Souza:
This raises a question...
how can Obama be so influenced
by a father who wasn't around?
I took this question
to psychologist Paul Vitz,
who has studied the influence
of absentee fathers
on children.
What effect does that
have on a kid,
to grow up without a father?
I'd say the general effect
of not having a father,
if the father is seen as having
abandoned you or left you,
is that you become
hostile to the things
that are associated
with your father.
But in Obama's case, his
mother spoke of his father
quite favorably and positively.
If I remember,
she married later again,
but spoke much more favorably
of Obama's father
than of her second husband.
She kept alive in Barack's
mind a positive image.
Isn't it true that sometimes
the absentee father can be
a better model in that he's
a model erased of defects?
Yes, that's true.
He's an airbrushed father.
The details of what he's like
sometimes don't live up to
the image you've created.
Well, in World War II,
not only were there
lots of absentee fathers,
a lot of them didn't come back.
They died in the war.
And in the 1950s,
it wasn't uncommon
to go into a home
and find a photograph
of a father who had been
killed in the war.
And he would be prominently
displayed in that photo,
usually in the living room
or someplace like that.
And you soon discovered
that he was a presence.
The mother, the wife, had
wisely represented her husband
and the father of her
children as a good man,
a man who had died
fighting for the country
and often as a brave man
and a successful soldier
or pilot or Marine
or what have you.
Now, in Obama's case, of
course the father was alive.
He wasn't dead.
He was in Africa.
And so, at some point in his life,
when Obama comes to college,
his sister comes to him
and she confronts him.
And she basically says,
"The man you're idealizing,
this mythical father,
isn't like that.
You have a fantasy
about the guy."
And this provokes in
Obama a kind of crisis.
Well, it certainly
would create a crisis
of the meaning
of your own identity.
Many young men
have this experience
of disappointment
with a father.
It often motivates them
very strongly
to prove that they're
significant,
to prove that
they're worthwhile,
to prove to the world
that however much
you may have disappointed me,
I'm not a disappointment.
D'Souza: "I would meet him
one night in a cold cell
in a chamber of my dreams.
My father was before me
with only a cloth
wrapped around his waist.
'Barack, I've always
wanted to tell you
how much I love you,' he said.
He seems small in my arms
now, the size of a boy.
And when I whispered to him
that we might leave together,
he shook his head and told me
it would be best if I left.
I awoke still weeping,
my first real tears for him
and for me, his jailer,
his judge, his son.
And I realized
perhaps for the first time
how, even in his absence,
his strong image
had given me some bulwark
in which to grow up,
an image to live up to
or to disappoint."
Vitz: He has the conflicts
and he has the tension
between his Americanism
and his Africanism.
He himself is an intersection
of major political forces
in his own psychology.
D'Souza:
After my visit with Vitz,
I felt a powerful desire
to enter Obama's world
and follow his journey
to find his father.
At the age of six,
Obama moved with his mom
and stepfather Lolo Soetoro
to Jakarta, Indonesia.
D'Souza:
What attracted Ann to Lolo
was that he was
a Third World guy
like her first husband.
Lolo recounted to Ann
how he lost his father
and brother
in the Indonesian Revolution.
The Dutch burned down
Lolo's house,
destroying nearly everything,
forcing his mom to sell
her gold jewelry
in exchange for food.
Lolo, as a teacher,
would now be part
of transforming the country
since the colonial Dutch
had been driven out.
( Obama reading ) "She had
expected it to be difficult,
this new life of hers.
Before leaving Hawaii,
she had tried to learn
all that she could
about Indonesia...
the history of colonialism...
first the Dutch
for over three centuries...
then the Japanese
during the war,
seeking control over vast stores
of oil, metal, and timber,
the fight for independence
after the war,
and the emergence of a freedom
fighter named Sukarno
as the country's
first president.
She was prepared for
the dysentery and fevers,
the cold-water baths
and having to squat
over a hole in the ground
to pee,
the electricity's going out
every few weeks,
the heat,
and the endless mosquitos.
D'Souza:
So I'm fascinated
because, of course,
I resonate with this.
All this colonialism
and anticolonialism
that is a little bit alien
to most Americans,
I'm completely familiar with.
I grew up with this.
This was in the air
when I was growing up.
And suddenly I realized,
wait a minute,
this is not Birmingham
or Selma in the '60s,
this is like the India
that I grew up in.
This scene,
these smells and sounds
are completely familiar to me.
The British in a sense
owned India.
They could take raw materials,
send them to factories
in England,
make them into goods, and then
sell those goods around the world.
They encouraged
an Indian educated class
to help administer the empire,
but they set a very low ceiling
above which no Indian
could rise.
So my grandfather
felt the wounds,
the injuries, the insults,
the humiliation of colonialism,
and it always made him
not only anti-British,
but slightly
anti-white.
When I told him
for the first time...
you know, I said,
"Grandpa, I think I'm going
to be going to America
for a year,"
his first reaction was
something like, "Don't go.
It's all white
over there."
D'Souza: Alice Dewey is a
famous anthropologist.
She's the granddaughter of
the philosopher John Dewey,
and she's been
a very close friend
of Ann Obama.
I happened to be
on the committee that chooses
the new import
of graduate students.
And here was a woman
who had spent seven years
in Indonesia, spoke Indonesian.
So I said, "I want that one,"
and, "She's mine."
D'Souza: Right. Did you
ever meet young Obama?
- Dewey: Oh, yeah.
- You did? What was he like?
Dewey:
A jolly, nice young man.
You know, Obama...
his book is "Dreams
from My Father."
- Yeah.
- And yet he knew his mother
much better than
his father, right?
- He hardly knew his father. Met him once.
- Yes.
And do you think
it's possible, then,
that young Obama
in some ways got a lot of his
father's ideas through his mother?
Well, I hadn't thought of that,
but I think you're right.
She always respected Barack Sr.
Now, did you also know
Lolo Soetoro?
Yes, in time.
Yeah.
It seems like Lolo
went in a more...
almost like a more pro-government
direction or a more pro-market...
Yeah. Yeah, I think
that's possible.
D'Souza: But something very
striking happened to Lolo.
He took a job working
for a California oil company.
He moved the family
into a white neighborhood.
He signed up with the Indonesian
military to fight the Communists.
And Ann Obama turned on him.
( Obama reading )
"Looking back,
I'm not sure that Lolo
ever fully understood
what my mother was going
through during these years,
why the things he was working
so hard to provide for her
seemed only to increase
the distance between them.
Sometimes I would overhear him and
my mother arguing in their bedroom,
usually about a refusal to attend
his company's dinner parties
where American businessmen from Texas
and Louisiana would slap Lolo's back
and boast about the palms
they had greased
to obtain the new offshore
drilling rights
while their wives
complained to my mother
about the quality
of Indonesian help.
He would ask her how it would
look for him to go alone
and remind her that
these were her own people.
And my mother's voice would
rise up to almost a shout...
'They are not my people.'
She had only one ally
in all this,
and that was the distant
authority of my father.
Increasingly, she would
remind me of his story...
how he had grown up poor
in a poor country,
in a poor continent,
how his life had been hard,
as hard as anything
that Lolo might have known.
He hadn't cut corners, though,
or played all the angles.
He was diligent and honest,
no matter what it cost him.
He had led his life
according to principles
that demanded a different
kind of toughness...
principles that promised
a higher form of power.
I would follow his example,
my mother decided.
I had no choice.
It was in the genes."
D'Souza:
Ann separates Barry
from Lolo's growing
pro-Western influence.
She decides to send him
back to Hawaii
to live with his grandparents.
When we think of Hawaii,
we think of tourists
and surfing and Mai Tais.
But that's not the real Hawaii.
That's not the Hawaii
the natives experience.
Obama explains.
"The ugly conquest
of the native Hawaiians
through aborted treaties
and crippling disease brought
on by the missionaries,
the carving up of rich volcanic
soil by American companies
for sugar cane
and pineapple plantations,
the indenturing system
that kept Japanese,
Chinese,
and Filipino immigrants
stooped sunup to sunset
in these same fields,
the internment of Japanese
Americans during the war...
all of this
was recent history."
Hawaiian colonization
is still a current issue.
At the University of Hawaii,
I met Willy Kauai,
an activist speaking about the
American occupation of Hawaii.
What hasn't really gone
all that well-documented
is the amount of American
resistance to this idea
of illegally annexing Hawaii.
There's great debates
within Congress.
All of these newspapers
throughout the United States
were showing their
opposition to this idea
of the United States
annexing Hawaii.
So finally, President McKinley,
regardless of the law
whether it be
international law,
whether it be
Hawaiian Kingdom law,
or whether it be
US Constitutional law,
he made the decision to go
ahead and occupy Hawaii.
D'Souza: Okay. Now,
many people may think,
"Well, what's the big deal?
That was 100 years ago.
It's ancient history.
Who cares?"
- Is this an issue that's live now in Hawaii?
- Very much.
It's very much an issue
that's live in Hawaii.
Why?
Isn't it a done deal?
- Isn't Hawaii now the 50th state?
- Yes, yes.
I mean, that's... that's
the general understanding
that a lot of people...
residents in Hawaii
and outside
of Hawaii... have.
But since the 1960s
and the 1970s,
there's really been a movement
towards gaining a better
understanding of what took place.
And so a lot of that
history that I refer to
is now starting to be revived
and starting to gain traction.
And people are starting to use
some of this history
as a venue for legal recourse.
D'Souza: This place was
really built with the wealth
of the sugar planters
and the pineapple planters,
and they used all that money to
build this beautiful school.
Of course, the ideology
of the school now
is probably the opposite.
It's the anticolonial ideology.
Oppression studies,
if you will.
And Obama got plenty of that
when he was here at Punahou.
Barack's grandfather
sought out a mentor
for his grandson.
He found an aging journalist
and poet named
Frank Marshall Davis.
The two became close
over eight years
until Obama left for college.
I had the opportunity to talk
to Cold War historian
Paul Kengor,
author of a book
on Frank Marshall Davis.
What is the connection
between Obama
and Frank Marshall Davis?
Well, in "Dreams
from My Father,"
he mentions Frank by name
22 times.
I mean, he never once
refers to him
as Frank Marshall Davis
or Frank Marshall
or Frank Davis;
it's just Frank.
Why is that?
Frank Marshall Davis
was a very controversial
political figure.
He wrote for a number
of publications
and he even started in Chicago
in the late 1940s
a Communist Party publication
called the "Chicago Star."
He did that for two years
and then he moved on
to Honolulu, to Hawaii,
and there he wrote...
called the
"Honolulu Record."
And if you read these columns,
they were so breathtakingly
anti-American.
I found numerous...
over and over and over
and over again...
comments where he was
mocking and ridiculing
the American way.
Stanley Dunham,
the grandfather,
was also on the left.
Obama himself recalled
how his grandfather
and Frank Marshall Davis
would get hammered, drunk.
They would spend
hours together,
and he saw in Davis
a potential mentor,
role model for Barack.
So Frank Marshall Davis
wasn't some kind
of a benign
civil rights figure.
Frank Marshall Davis was considered
such a threat by the FBI
that they actually placed him
on the federal government's
security index.
And what that means
is that he was considered
such a potential threat
that if a war ever broke out
between the United States
and the Soviet Union,
Frank Marshall Davis
could be placed
under immediate arrest.
Why has the media
avoided reporting
on the connection
between Obama and Davis?
Mm, it would have to.
I mean, have we ever had
a President
of the United States
who was mentored
to some meaningful degree
by a literal pro-Soviet,
pro-Communist,
card-carrying member
of Communist Party USA?
Card number 47544.
( laughs ) And of that alone...
that alone the media...
the pro-Obama media
has to ignore.
And they have.
And they'll call me
"Joe McCarthy"
for even bothering
to look at it.
( Obama reading ) "At night in the
dorms, we discussed neocolonialism,
Frantz Fanon, Eurocentrism,
and patriarchy.
I chose my friends carefully...
the more politically active
black students,
the foreign students,
the Chicanos,
the Marxist professors
and structural feminists
and punk-rock
performance poets."
D'Souza:
Obama's half-sister Auma
visits him and gives
a very different picture
of Barack Obama Sr.
This father
is an abusive alcoholic.
He beats his wives.
He gets into
drunk-driving accidents.
In one case he kills a man.
In another, he hurts
himself so badly
that both his legs
have to be amputated.
He bursts into
Auma's room at night,
raging about how he has been
betrayed by the world.
( Obama reading ) "I felt as if my
world had been turned on its head,
as if I had woken up to find
a blue sun in a yellow sky
or heard animals
speaking like men.
To think that all my life
I had been wrestling
with nothing more
than a ghost."
D'Souza: I had learned about
Obama's stepfather Lolo
and his early mentor
Frank Marshall Davis,
but it was time
to learn more about
Barack Obama Sr.,
his absentee father.
I would follow
Obama's own footsteps
when he visited Kenya in 1987.
( choral group
singing in Swahili )
( singing continues )
D'Souza: Kenya made a big
impression on Obama.
He dedicates nearly
one-third of his book
to his visit there.
His family history was explained
to him by Granny Obama.
She's not actually
his grandmother,
but one of his grandfather's
five wives.
As a member of the Luo tribe,
he was a polygamist.
In an interview
with "Newsweek,"
Granny Sarah said of Obama...
Interpreter: "I look at him and
I see all the same things.
He has taken everything
from his father.
The son is realizing
everything the father wanted.
The dreams of the father
are still alive in the son."
D'Souza:
I was hoping to learn more
from Granny Sarah
about Barack Sr. and Jr.
Granny's speaking fee
was a goat.
- We played it safe and brought three.
- ( bleating )
At first, we were
welcomed by Granny.
Through an interpreter,
she began to tell us
about the Obama family.
My eyes fixated on the grave
of Obama's grandfather
and father.
I whispered to our cameraman,
"This is where
it all began."
( interpreter speaking )
D'Souza: The interpreter called
Obama's half-sister Auma,
who told Granny
not to do the interview.
The mood turned quickly.
Gone was the sweet smile
which greeted us,
and the police
who maintained security
around the house became tense.
Auma called
the local chieftains.
Our security advisor
made it clear
we were not safe
in Kogelo anymore.
D'Souza: During the campaign
I was surfing the Web.
I saw a story,
I believe, on CNN
that Obama's half-brother
George Obama
was living in Nairobi in a hut.
And I thought, "This has got
to be some kind of a joke."
But I click on the story
and there's a picture,
and it looks like something
out of "Slumdog Millionaire"...
a kid in his 20s
standing with his arms
outstretched,
and the arms reflect
the size of the hut.
That's it.
You met Obama the first time
when you were very young.
I remember that, yeah.
- I was, like, five years or six years old.
- Yeah.
We shook hands,
talked for a couple
of minutes, and they left.
I was just surprised...
this half-white guy
is, like, my brother, you know?
- Right.
- Yeah.
As you know, during the
time of the election,
there were some news reports
in CNN and elsewhere.
The theme of the
articles was that
Obama had not done
anything to help you.
I think he has
a family of his own.
He's supposed
to help his family.
Right, but don't you think
you're part of his family?
Yeah, I'm part of his family,
but I'm overage,
so I help myself.
You're an adult. You can help yourself.
I understand.
Well, let me put it
a different way.
Recently, President Obama spoke
and he was quoting from the
famous story of Cain and Abel,
that we are
our brother's keeper.
Now, my point is
you are his brother.
Has he been your keeper?
Go ask him.
He's got other issues
to deal with.
Well, he's taking care of the
world, but don't you start at home?
Yeah, he's taking care of the
world, so he's taking care of me.
I'm part of the world.
So you mean when he fights
to stop global warming,
it helps you?
- Yeah.
- Because there's less carbon in the world
and you can breathe
a little more easily?
Right, so he doesn't have to help
you directly is what you're saying?
- No, he doesn't have to do that.
- Okay.
Your book came out what year?
- 2010.
- 2010.
I want to read you a couple of
things you say in your book,
which I found very interesting
and, quite honestly,
I agree with.
They resonate with my own life.
You say, "I don't think
that colonialism"...
which is a big theme
in Obama's book also...
"is responsible for the
sufferings and poverty of Kenya."
You say that "around the
time of independence"...
I'm quoting you... "Kenya
was on an economic par
with Malaysia or Singapore.
We were at the same level
in terms of development.
Look where we are now
and where they are.
They are practically
developed and industrialized
while Kenya is still
a basket case."
Can you say a word about that?
Yeah, I think it's true.
Look at South Korea.
When we got independence,
we were far ahead of them.
- Right.
- But look at them now.
Now, let me read you
one more thing.
You say about South Africa...
I must say I even
find this a bit shocking,
but I want your opinion on it.
"Look at South Africa.
They were under the whites
until the 1990s,
and look where they are now.
They are practically
a developed nation.
So who is better off...
us, who kicked out the British,
or the South Africans?
Maybe if we had let the
whites stay a bit longer,
we'd be where
South Africa is today."
Do you actually...
would you actually think
it would have been better if the
whites stayed a little longer?
- Yeah, but it's true.
- So, because...
It would have
developed us, yeah.
Instead of... we were
fighting, fighting,
- fighting over nothing.
- Okay.
- We are Third World. They are Second World.
- Right.
I assume you have no memories
of your actual father,
your biological father.
Yeah, he died when I was
six months old, so...
What did your mom tell you
about him, if anything?
- He was really educated.
- He was well-educated, yeah.
Yeah, my mom
was disappointed in me
because I actually didn't
finish my schooling.
- Yeah?
- So it was like
I really did let her down.
I let my father down, too,
because he was an
intellectual guy, you know.
( speaking accented English )
( Obama reading ) "A few
months after my 21st birthday,
a stranger called
to give me the news.
The line was thick with static.
( affects accent )
'Barry? Barry, is this you?'
'Yes. Who's this?'
'Yes, Barry, this is
your Aunt Jane in Nairobi.
Can you hear me?'
'I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?'
'Aunt Jane.
Listen, Barry,
your father is dead.
He was killed
in a car accident.
Hello?
Can you hear me?
I say your father
is dead.'"
D'Souza: This is why
Obama must go to Kenya...
to confront his father's ghost.
( drums playing )
( sizzling )
( Obama reading ) "How to explain
the emotions of that day.
I can summon each moment in my
mind almost frame by frame.
It wasn't simple joy that I
felt in each of these moments.
Rather, it was a sense
that everything I was doing,
every touch and breath and word
carried the full weight
of my life,
that a circle
was beginning to close
so that I might finally
recognize myself as I was,
here, now, in one place.
For a long time, I sat between
the two graves and wept.
When my tears
were finally spent,
I felt a calmness wash over me.
I felt the circle
finally close.
I realized that who I was,
what I cared about
was no longer
just a matter of intellect
or obligation..."
I, Barack Hussein Obama...
"...no longer
a construct of words."
...do solemnly swear...
"I saw that my life
in America...
the black life, the white life,
the sense of abandonment
I had felt as a boy,
the frustration and hope
I had witnessed in Chicago...
all of it was connected
with this small plot of earth
an ocean away,
connected by more than
the accident of a name
or the color of my skin.
The pain I had felt
was my father's pain.
My questions were
my brothers' questions.
Their struggle,
my birthright."
D'Souza: This is where Obama
reconciles with his father.
He resolves not to be like his
father, but to take his dream.
Where the father failed,
he will succeed.
In doing so, perhaps
he can become worthy
of his father's love,
the love he never got.
But you've heard
the statements and views
of President Obama
on television.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you knew Barack Obama Sr.
I knew him, Barry.
- Were their ideas different or similar?
- Ah.
There I can tell you
that their ideas
seemed to be like...
- Woman: Like one.
- The same.
- Woman: The same.
- The same.
D'Souza: So actually, the
father and son were...
The same.
They are.
D'Souza: In Nairobi
we found Philip Ochieng,
a distinguished writer and editor
of the newspaper the "Nation."
He came to America to study
at the same time
Barack Obama Sr. did.
The two remained
lifelong friends.
( speaking accented English )
Right.
D'Souza: Do you believe
that the West became rich
by taking the wealth
from the colonized countries?
D'Souza:
Right.
To tame Israel.
Now, do you see
Israel as, like,
a little colonial power
in the Middle East?
I see.
Now, what about the economic
wing of colonialism?
( Ochieng speaking )
D'Souza: We sympathize
with anticolonialism
because, remember,
America started out
as an anticolonial country.
We got our independence
from the British.
But Ochieng's anticolonialism
is different.
This anticolonialism developed in the
Third World in the 20th century.
It was a reaction against
Western militaries,
Western missionaries,
and Western merchants.
And consequently,
this kind of anticolonialism
became anticapitalist,
anti-Christian,
and anti-American.
It sees the rich countries
getting richer,
not by invention
or innovation or hard work,
but by invading
and occupying and looting
the poor countries
and taking their resources.
And here we get some help
from Barack Obama Sr.
In 1965,
he published an article
in the "East Africa Journal"
in which he asked
this question...
"What does a country do
when you have
powerful concentrations
of economic wealth
at the top?"
He proposed two solutions.
First, you have to use
the power of the state
to control and regulate
private industry.
And second, he said you need
very high tax rates.
How high?
"Theoretically,
there is nothing
that can stop the government
from taxing 100% of income,
so long as the people get
benefits from the government
commensurate with
their income which is taxed."
Is this what
President Obama means
by paying our fair share?
This is not the anticolonialism
of Washington, Jefferson,
and Franklin.
When I was growing up,
India tried the recipes
of socialism and collectivism.
So did China.
But they failed miserably.
And so now India and China,
but also other countries...
South Korea,
Indonesia, Chile...
these countries
are embracing globalization,
modernization, capitalism...
the American recipe.
And they are growing
at three to five times
the rate of the United States.
So Obama has things
completely upside down.
He's embracing his father's
failed Third World collectivism
even as these other countries
are embracing
the American recipe
and succeeding.
So how does Obama do it?
How does a guy who possesses
a Third World,
anti-American view,
an ideology as remote and
unrecognizable to most Americans
as the capital of Kenya
or Indonesia,
manage to get himself elected?
How does he sell this
in Peoria?
My mother was white
and my father was black.
I had a sort of familiarity
with both worlds.
Barack Obama
would have had that.
He would have known them
intimately.
He would have known how he
was received in both worlds.
He understood that
given our racial history
in America,
that he was in a sense
an ideal.
He was a kind of redeemer.
He was something
that we had to prove,
which is that
we could be a society
that could somehow move
beyond race.
If we couldn't
move beyond race,
he wouldn't exist, literally.
There's an aspiration
in American life to overcome,
to redeem ourselves
from this past.
This is an impulse
in American culture,
to finally have it behind us.
He was the guy
who could touch it.
And he knew people were projecting
all of these things onto him.
People want to be able
to tell their grandchildren
that they voted
for Barack Obama.
"And maybe I was wrong,
maybe I made a mistake,
maybe I didn't really know him,
but it still documents the
fact that I'm not a racist.
I'm not what America used to be.
I'm innocent of that."
And how many chances like
that come along in history?
Not many. He's the
first one in politics.
Look at what's interesting.
The reason
he's in the White House
is because of his race,
his blackness.
Minorities, often when they come
into the American mainstream,
they wear a mask that they hope
will bring some advantage.
Bargaining is one of those
masks, challenging is another.
But in bargaining,
the bargainer
goes to white Americans
and basically says,
"Listen, I'm going to give you
the benefit of the doubt.
I'm going to presume
that you are not racist.
If I do not hold your race
against you,
you will not hold
my race against me."
Call it
the "gratitude factor."
This is what Obama knew he had.
He knew he had this talent.
( Obama reading ) "Another one
of those tricks I had learned...
people were satisfied
so long as you were courteous
and smiled and made
no sudden moves.
They were more than satisfied,
they were relieved.
'Such a pleasant surprise to find
a well-mannered young black man
who didn't seem angry
all the time.'"
He was sort of naturally born
to bargaining.
He talks about it
in his own autobiography
that he realized
whites would like you
if you were black
as long as you weren't angry.
They're very likely
to support you
more than they would
someone else.
So I think Barack Obama
realized from childhood on
that this was a mechanism
in American society
that redounded to his benefit,
that he could play,
that he could work
this gratitude that whites
feel for not being judged.
Let's get unified.
The sky will open.
( crowd laughs )
Hillary Clinton:
The light will come down,
celestial choirs
will be singing,
and everyone will know
we should do the right thing,
and the world will be perfect.
Now, Jesse Jackson
ran for president.
Much of today's
civil rights leadership
are blacks who come
into mainstream American life
and say to whites, "I'm going
to presume you are a racist.
Look at the whole history
of America.
It's been racist.
It's still a racist society.
And I'm going to presume
the worst about you,
that you're a part
of that."
Challengers in that sense
look for entitlements.
They look for programmed...
"I will give you
your innocence as a white,
but you're going to have to
do something to demonstrate."
People who are challengers
do very well
inside of American
institutions,
but they would never do well
in a general election.
Jesse Jackson tried to run.
Al Sharpton tried to run.
Neither of them
ever got very far at all
because white Americans particularly
don't feel comfortable.
They feel that, in a sense,
they're being shaken down.
Their leverage is being
used against them.
When he was running
to be the president
of the "Harvard Law Review,"
he had spent a lot of time
searching for himself
and deciding that
he was a black man.
He goes to Harvard,
and there's this
politically correct,
fraught time,
and there are conservatives
and there are liberals.
He manages to persuade
all of them
- that he's on their side.
- Man: Yeah.
And he realizes that people
want to help him.
They want to help.
It makes people
feel good to help.
And this is an important
insight for him.
"Oh, my gosh, I have this gift.
I have this knack.
People are going
to want to help me.
I'll let them help me all the
way to the White House."
It was a racially
motivated vote.
No white man could be two years
out of the Illinois
State Legislature
and walk into the White House.
Americans did not know him,
didn't want to know him.
And he knew that, too.
He knew he was invisible,
and he knew people
were projecting all
of these things onto him.
D'Souza: For white America,
a majority white country,
to turn over
the ultimate power...
( cheering )
...and to entrust that
to an African-American
only 35 years after
the Civil Rights Movement...
I mean, that is
a stunning accomplishment.
Now, that's not
Obama's accomplishment,
that is America's
accomplishment.
D'Souza: Still, for Obama to make
himself acceptable to America,
he had to hide
major elements of his past.
He had to hide the group I call
"Obama's Founding Fathers."
And who were
his Founding Fathers?
Well, let's just say
they were not Jefferson,
Washington, and Franklin.
We already met
Frank Marshall Davis,
the poet, the Communist
Party member.
And here is Bill Ayers,
Obama's Chicago pal.
Ayers has something in common
with Osama bin Laden...
they both tried
to blow up the Pentagon.
Ayers also bombed
a New York police station
and the US Capitol as a member
of the terrorist group
Weather Underground.
Obama and Ayers met in 1995,
and the two served
on the Annenberg Challenge
and also as directors
on the Woods Fund.
Ayers held a fund raiser for then
state senate candidate Obama.
Obama sought out other mentors,
including his Columbia
professor Edward Said,
the leading anticolonial
critic of Israel
and a former representative
to the PLO.
Obama stayed in contact
with Said until his death,
even attending a Palestinian
fundraiser in Chicago
with Said as the main speaker.
Then we meet his Harvard
law professor
Roberto Mangabeira Unger,
a Brazilian socialist.
He is a leading
anticolonial scholar.
He left Harvard to join the
socialist government in Brazil,
but he was too radical
even for them,
so they kicked him out.
Now he's back at Harvard
where he seems to fit right in.
Obama took
several classes with him,
and the two kept
in close contact
until the presidential
election.
Unger declined
all interviews in 2008,
as he noted afterward
that he was "a leftist,
and, by conviction as well as
temperament, a revolutionary.
Any association of mine
with Barack Obama
in the course of the campaign
could only do harm."
Finally, there's this guy...
Jeremiah Wright.
He was Obama's pastor
for 20 years.
He married the Obamas,
baptized their children,
and was in a sense a
surrogate father for Barack.
The connection between
Obama and Wright
is undeniable
and long-lasting.
When Wright's sermons surfaced
during the election,
they were a genuine threat
to Obama's
carefully-constructed image.
So the media portrayed Wright
as a kind of a radical nut.
But he's not a nut.
He's actually
the leading champion
of Third World
liberation theology,
the religious wing
of anticolonialism.
We cannot see
how what we are doing
is the same thing
al-Qaeda is doing
under a different colored flag.
D'Souza: Obama knew the Wright
scandal could sink him.
That's because it raised
the sensitive issue of...
Not God bless America,
God damn America...
D'Souza: Wright was
saying that America
is the leading rogue nation
in the world.
Not Iran, not North Korea,
but America.
For the first time
in Obama's public ascent,
his anticolonial beliefs
were on the brink
of being exposed.
According to Wright,
he was offered $150,000
to keep quiet.
And when that didn't work,
Obama himself met with
Wright to get his silence.
( interviewer speaking )
( Wright speaking )
The politically
safe thing to do
would be to move on
from this episode
and just hope that it fades
into the woodwork.
The fact is that the comments
that have been made
and the issues that have
surfaced over the last few weeks
reflect the complexities
of race in this country
that we've never
really worked through,
a part of our union that we
have not yet made perfect.
D'Souza: Obama acts
as if we need to have
some kind of a national
seminar about race relations.
Somehow the real issue,
which is whether America
is the most evil nation
in the world,
disappears into the background.
Obama has skillfully
changed the subject,
and we fell for it.
If Senator Obama
did not say what he said,
he would never get elected.
D'Souza:
Obama's Founding Fathers
are successfully swept
under the rug.
He trounces
the political machine,
taking the Democratic nomination
away from Hillary Clinton,
- ( crowd cheering )
- ...and is then chosen as the fulfillment
of the Civil Rights Movement.
This insecure kid who grew
up in Hawaii and Indonesia,
whose life is shaped
by his father's ghost,
and whose ideology could not
be more directly remote
from what Americans
believe or care about,
is now the President
of the United States.
It's been a long time coming.
But tonight, because of
what we did on this day,
in this election,
at this defining moment,
change has come to America.
( cheering )
I will ask you to join in the
work of remaking this nation
the only way it's been done
in America for 221 years...
block by block, brick by brick,
calloused hand
by calloused hand.
D'Souza: Since taking office in
2009, change has come to America.
But the changes
Obama has enacted
transcend the traditional
differences
between Democrats
and Republicans
and reflect
something different,
something completely separated
from America's thought
altogether.
( Obama reading ) "All
my life, I had carried
a single image of my father,
one that I had sometimes
rebelled against,
but had never questioned,
one that I had later tried
to take as my own."
D'Souza: Only through the
dreams of Obama's father
can we understand
the actions of the son.
Now we understand
why Obama would return
the bust of Winston Churchill.
Churchill was
a lifelong colonialist,
head of the Colonial Office,
and the prime minister
who crushed the anticolonial
Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya.
We are still a leader
in space exploration,
but frankly I have been
pushing NASA
to revamp its vision.
D'Souza: His anticolonialism
has diverted NASA
from being a symbol
of American greatness
to being a more modest
foreign relations operation.
When I became
the NASA administrator,
he wanted me to expand our
international relationships,
and perhaps foremost
he wanted me to find a way
to reach out
to the Muslim worlds
to help them feel good
about their historic contribution
to science and engineering.
D'Souza: The British
Empire is now gone
except for a few outposts
like the Falkland Islands.
Obama wants to close
that chapter
by returning the Falklands
to Argentina.
Through the dreams
of Obama's father,
we can understand why Obama would
restrict drilling in America
while promoting it in Brazil
and Mexico and Colombia.
He's enriching the previously
colonized countries
at the expense
of the colonizers.
Then there was
the health care bill.
Man: Have you read all the
way through the bill yet?
( laughs )
We have to pass the bill
so that you can find out
what is in it.
D'Souza:
And what would this cost?
Obama had a solid handle on it.
What they'll say is,
"Will it cost too much money?"
But you know what?
It would cost about...
it would cost about
the same as what
we would spend...
it... over the course
of 10 years,
it would cost
what it would cost us...
it...
( chuckles )
All right.
Okay, we're going to.
It would cost us about the same
as it would cost
for about...
hold on one second.
I can't hear myself.
But I'm glad
you're fired up, though.
I'm glad.
D'Souza: Obama's solution is
to bring major industries
like health insurance under the
rod of government control.
Now we understand
why Obama would allow
his brother George to live
in the slums of Nairobi.
George doesn't worship at the
altar of Barack Obama Sr.,
nor does he hold his father's
anticolonial views.
Anticolonialism is not
about helping the poor
so much as it is about stripping
wealth from the rich.
And Obama has a global
definition of "rich."
When he talks about
the 1%, the 99%,
he doesn't just mean
in America,
he means globally.
Even poor Americans are rich
by global standards.
If Obama seems
weirdly sympathetic
to Muslim jihadists captured
in Afghanistan or Iraq,
wanting to close down
Guantanamo,
giving them constitutional
rights, we now know why.
He sees these guys
as anticolonial
freedom fighters,
like his dad,
the occupied people
pushing out the occupiers.
The occupied people
pushing out the occupiers?
No wonder Obama supports
the Occupy Wall Street
movement so strongly.
You're the reason I ran
for office in the first place.
D'Souza: Young renegades
pushing out the ones
they believe have stolen
all the wealth.
In his first term,
we have already seen
Obama begin the work
of remaking America.
But he's not done yet.
Keith Olbermann: Another guy
lost here in the complexities
of 21st-century America...
Dinesh D'Souza...
Diane Rehm:
Then you've got the cover
of "Forbes" Magazine,
that cover story
by Dinesh D'Souza.
I think nothing has turned
my stomach so much
in recent years
as reading that piece.
Look at that "Forbes"
Magazine article
about the president.
It reads like science fiction.
- Barack Obama...
- Kenyan anticolonialist...
Joe Biden:
Kenyan "anticolonialist."
A father who was a drunkard
and is now reincarnated...
I forget the exact phrase...
in the White House.
It's all being
channeled through.
And guys like Newt Gingrich
repeating that garbage?
They attempt to delegitimize
one of the most talented men
to enter American politics
in three generations.
There is an unhinged quality
to a lot of this,
and Dinesh D'Souza's story
is, for a scholar,
very unscholarly.
Jonathan Alter:
You're trying to put him
into a left-wing
straitjacket here
based on the writings
of his father.
- D'Souza: Not really.
- I need more evidence.
- I'll give you the evidence.
- Where's the evidence?
D'Souza: "He's a Muslim;
he's not an American;
he's a socialist"
I don't think really work,
so I'm putting
a new card on the table.
And look,
I'm a college president.
I'm not trying to bash Obama
in a crude way.
I'm trying to give
an explanatory framework.
And I think the anticolonial
framework
explains his domestic policy,
explains his foreign policy,
and explains a lot
of little stuff he's doing
that no other theory
can explain.
D'Souza: At the end of my book,
I made three predictions.
Obama will do
nothing significant
to stop Iran from getting
nuclear bombs.
He hasn't.
He would spend money as if
the deficit didn't matter.
He has.
I also said that if the
political climate changes
and Obama is forced
to tackle the deficit,
he will cut the military
and seek to raise taxes.
These predictions
give me the confidence
to take what we know
about Obama
and project what America
will look like in 2016
if he's reelected.
( bell tolls )
D'Souza: We've learned
a lot about Obama,
and yet in some ways we
haven't seen the real Obama.
Why? Because
in the first term,
a president sometimes holds
his cards back.
The comments
to the Russian president
off-mic
were an insight
into Obama's expectation
that after he's been reelected,
he will be free to pursue
what he really wants
to achieve...
changes within
the United States,
to move it in the
direction of socialism,
and internationally
to limit and withdraw
American presence
and influence.
D'Souza: Welcome to the
2012 Nuclear Summit.
Now who didn't come
to the antinuclear party?
Iran didn't come.
North Korea didn't come.
And Obama officials said
they didn't care.
The whole purpose
of the summit was to reduce
the nuclear weapons
of America and its allies.
When Obama became president,
America had
around 5,000 warheads.
Now, according
to the START Treaty,
America will go down
to around 1,500.
Obama has asked
the Pentagon to study
going down even further to 300.
And here is
the ultimate goal...
No single nation
should pick and choose
which nation
holds nuclear weapons.
And that's why
I strongly reaffirm
America's commitment
to seek a world
in which no nations
hold nuclear weapons.
D'Souza:
A nuclear-free world?
Dreamy idea.
The only problem is that
none of our enemies
are reducing their stockpiles.
Obama calls for
a nuclear-free world,
but the only countries'
nuclear weapons
that he can reduce is ours.
Why is he doing it?
This levels the nuclear
playing field
between America, Russia, China,
North Korea, and everyone else.
This is
the anticolonial dream...
to end American
nuclear superiority
and restore a world
where many countries
have equal power.
He doesn't think well
of the United States,
and therefore he doesn't want
to see its influence expand,
which is a strange thing
for a US President.
D'Souza:
I met with Daniel Pipes,
an expert on the Middle East
and one of the only people
to raise the alarm
about radical Islam
before September 11th.
I've come here to Cairo
to seek a new beginning
between the United States
and Muslims around the world.
One based on mutual interest
and mutual respect
and one based upon the truth
that America and Islam
are not exclusive
and need not be in competition.
Instead, they overlap
and share common principles...
principles of justice
and progress,
tolerance and the dignity
of all human beings.
Comes out of a tradition that's
highly critical of the United States.
Sees the United States,
internally badly set up
and, externally a force
for malign influence.
And therefore, he
presumably sees his role
as tempering both of those,
making it better internally
and reducing the bad influence
of the United States abroad.
More recently, tension has
been fed by colonialism
that denied rights and
opportunities to many Muslims
and a cold war in which
Muslim-majority countries
were too often
treated as proxies
without regard
to their own aspirations.
Obama's policy
in Afghanistan reflects,
I think to a tee,
this ambivalence he has
of wanting to have
successes as president
and not liking what the United
States does in the world.
So on the one hand he increases
the number of soldiers,
on the other hand he says, "Well, but
they're going to be out by a certain date."
And the result is a mishmash.
D'Souza: How does Obama
view the state of Israel?
Pipes: Obama comes
out of a milieu
in which the state
of Israel is seen
as a horrible entity.
Edward Said was
his professor at Columbia,
a leading anti-Zionist
figure.
Rashid Khalidi
was his friend in Chicago,
an important
anti-Israel professor.
And Ali Abunimah, an
activist blogger in Chicago,
who's far more vicious
than either of those two.
And these were his buddies
that we know about.
I think... might speculate
that were he reelected,
more of those early ideas
would come out.
What would you worry about if
America was no longer America?
I think it will be a much
more vicious environment
in which wars
will be more common,
in which extremist ideologies
will be more common,
and there'll be no great
power to hold them back.
So I think the power
of the United States
is crucial for people
around the world.
- So, bad not just for us, but bad for everybody?
- Indeed.
What prospects
does America face
in the Middle East
over the next few years?
What are the dangers
that we have to look out for?
The general movement
in the Middle East
is away from the United States
and towards Islamism,
radical Islam,
totalitarian Islam.
And the forces
who have historically
been aligned with us
are weaker.
That landscape is changing
for the worse.
D'Souza: We are out of
Iraq and Afghanistan.
Egypt moves from being an ally
to being governed
by the radical Muslims.
Libya, Saudi Arabia, and
Jordan follow the same path.
No roadblocks
are placed in the way
of Iran's pursuit
of nuclear weapons.
Israel is isolated.
The Middle East
transforms itself
into the United States
of Islam.
Obama: We have the power
to make the world we seek,
but only if we have the courage
to make a new beginning.
The world could be a pretty
scary place in 2016...
Israel brought to its knees,
America's defenses weakened,
the Muslim world united.
But America would still be
a rich country.
How does Obama change that?
How does he restore the world
before colonialism?
Actually, there is a way,
and it's a beautiful way.
I call it "debt as a weapon
of mass destruction."
What were annual deficits
for Reagan and the Bushes
have become monthly deficits
under Obama.
And if we go over
the tipping point,
we don't just hit decline,
we hit collapse.
We are rapidly approaching
the tipping point,
and it will be felt
around the world.
There will be no place to hide.
From 1998 until 2008,
I served as the Comptroller
General of the United States
or, in English,
the Auditor General.
The greatest threat
to our future
is our own fiscal
irresponsibility.
We are great in part
because we have
the largest economy on earth.
We're not going to stay great
unless we keep
a strong economy.
The simple fact is when
somebody holds your debt,
they have more leverage on you
and you have less
leverage on them.
Based upon our
current policy path,
we're likely to see
total debt levels
in the United States,
for the federal
government alone,
of over $20 trillion by 2016.
- So 20 trillion is $20 thousand billion.
- That's correct.
And that's up from 5.6
trillion in 2000.
From George Washington
to William Jefferson Clinton...
the first president
to the 42nd president,
we accumulated $5.6 trillion
in total debt.
Under George Walker Bush, 43,
and President Barack Obama...
we've gone
from 5.6 trillion
to over $15 trillion
and adding debt
at record rates.
We're only two to three years
away from where Greece was
was when Greece
had their debt crisis.
Now, we're not Greece.
We're the largest economy
on earth.
We're the temporary
sole superpower.
We issue debt
in our own currency
and we have the largest
reserve currency in the world.
And so that means
we have more time.
That means that we are
a temporary safe haven,
given uncertainties
in the world.
But we are not exempt from
the laws of prudent finance.
If we don't put
our finances in order,
then the opportunities
for our children
and grandchildren will be less
and their standard of living
is likely to be less as well.
The first three words
of the Constitution
need to come alive...
"We the people."
We need to make sure
that the President
of the United States,
whoever that is,
will tell the truth
and provide
the needed leadership.
Our future can be
better than our past.
D'Souza:
Will Obama's America
offer real solutions
or more slogans?
# Obama's gonna change it #
# Obama's gonna lead 'em #
# We're gonna change
the world #
# Yes, we can can can #
# Yes, we can can can #
# Yes, we can can can,
yes, we can... #
We meet at one of those
defining moments,
a moment when our nation
is at war,
our economy is in turmoil,
and the American promise
has been threatened once more.
Change happens because
the American people demand it,
because they rise up
and insist on new ideas
- # Yes, we can... #
- and new leadership.
- # Yes, we can... #
- A new politics for a new time.
- # Yes, we can... #
- America, this is one of those moments.
# Can can can,
yes, we can... #
It's time for us
to change America!
# Yes, we can! #
D'Souza: The first
time, we did not know
what change would look like.
Now we do.
The first time, we did not
know Barack Obama.
Now we do.
Which dream will we carry
into 2016?
The American dream
or Obama's dream?
The future is not in my hands.
It's not even in Obama's hands.
The future is in your hands.
