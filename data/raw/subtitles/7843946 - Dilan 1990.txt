{\an8}[ Jakarta, Desember 2014 ]
My name is Milea.
Milea Adnan Hussein.
I was born in Jakarta.
My mother is from Bandung
and she was a band vocalist.
My father is an officer in the Army.
He's from West Sumatra.
After they got married,
they moved to Slipi, Jakarta.
In 1990,
my father was assigned to Bandung.
I moved to a high school
in Buah Batu, Bandung.
And my story begins from there.
It's about a person who taught me ...
... the importance of wishing
someone a good night's sleep.
[ Bandung, September 1990 ]
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- You're Milea, right?
- I am.
- Can I read your future?
- You want to read my future?
Yeah. I can see us meeting again
today in the canteen.
???
- Want a lift?
- No, I'm good.
But someday you're going
to ride with me.
You'd better believe it.
See ya.
You know what?
This morning some boy on a bike
tried to read my future.
What do you mean
tried to read your future?
He said we'll meet again
in the canteen.
- Do you know who he is?
- I don't know him.
- So, are we going to the canteen?
- No, I'm good.
Do you realized it's already been
2 weeks since you transferred here?
I know, right?
Lia. I'm offering you
a position as the class secretary.
- Secretary?
- Nandan is the class president.
I know.
But why me?
Come on,
just say yes.
- Will you?
- All right, whatever.
Excuse me.
- Are you Milea?
- Yes, I am.
- Here's a letter for you.
- A letter?
From a friend of mine.
- Where's Wati?
- She's already left to the canteen.
Okay.
See ya.
He's Piyan.
From 2-Physics-1 class.
- Do you know him?
- No.
"Milea, my prediction about our meeting
in the canteen was apparently inaccurate."
"Sorry, but allow me
to read your future again."
"We'll meet again tomorrow."
- But tomorrow is Sunday.
- What?
Nothing. So ...
What are my tasks as a secretary?
[ Sunday, September 16, 1990 ]
- There are guests outside.
- For me?
Yes.
Boys.
???
- I'm delivering an invitation.
- What kind of invitation?
- You can read it. But only later.
- Okay.
- Piyan. What's the Arabic for that?
- What are you talking about?
'Iqro', Milea.
I'll see you later.
- How do you know my house?
- I also know your birthday.
- And I know who your God is too.
- It's Allah.
It's the same for me.
I'll take my leave.
Assalamu'alaikum or not?
- Assalamu'alaikum.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
Let's go.
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.
In the name of Allah.
The most gracious
and the most merciful.
I hereby, truly sincerely invite
Milea Adnan to school ...
... on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
It's for you,
from Kak Benni.
- Your boyfriend.
- Hello.
It was a busy day for me.
I cleaned my shoes, ...
talked on the phone
with my boyfriend in Jakarta.
Meanwhile, what I wanted to do
was just smile all day ...
... thinking about the weird invitation
from the fortune teller.
At ease!
Attention for students who haven't
paid their September's tuition ...
Please don't forget
to do so.
Move!
Tuck in your shirt!
Let's go!
Mr. Suripto
will give the next announcement.
Stand in line!
Straighten
your uniform!
- It's him again.
- Who is he?
He's Dilan.
School's Flag Ceremony is our way
of honoring our deceased heroes.
Our country needs
discipline students.
That morning I found out
the fortune-teller's name is ... Dilan.
Even after knowing that, some of you
didn't show up at the ceremony.
Rani said he's from
2-Physics-1 class.
He's a member
of famous bike gang in Bandung.
His rank in the gang
could make you shiver.
Combat Commander.
Dilan        .
Dilan 1990
Are you going home by microbus?
Can I tag along?
- Where to?
- Your home by microbus.
- No need.
- But microbuses are open to public.
- But you're riding your bike.
- Don't worry about that.
This is the first time
I sit beside you.
Milea ...
You're beautiful.
???
Thank you.
But I've yet to fall for you.
But this afternoon, who knows?
We'll see.
???
I foretell that you will soon
learn my name.
Hearing him said that,
I swear I almost said, "I already know."
"I don't need any more predictions.
Better for you to go away."
Do you know all the students
in our school are arrogant?
Do you know who is the only student
kind enough to go to Mr. Suripto's office?
Who?
Me!
Sorry
if I bother you.
That's your ride.
I was just
escorting you.
I don't want anything bad
happen to you.
Yeah.
Stop!
But after he left,
I felt guilty for being rude to him.
He must be upset.
Actually he's more fun than Benni,
my boring boyfriend in Jakarta ...
... whose poetries are often copied
from Khalil Gibran books, ...
... or worse
from teen magazines.
This is weird. Why am I comparing
that fortune teller with Benni?
That's Ridwan's desk,
and he sits with Hanafi.
That is Jenar's desk
and sitting next to her is Revi.
Letter for you, Lia.
Letter from who?
How about this desk?
We can do it again later.
The recess is almost over.
Okay.
"Information!"
"Since yesterday's afternoon,
I'm officially in love with you."
- What's in the letter?
- Nothing. It's nothing.
- You're that hungry, Ran?
- Nandan is going to pay for my lunch.
Is this the only
canteen we have?
Some kids eat here and
some eat at Bik Eem's food stall.
- What's that?
- Bik Eem's food stall is ...
... a small restaurant
behind our school.
Yeah, they are allowed
to smoke there.
Kids from other school
often eat there too.
It's their hangout center.
- Hi, Lia.
- Hi.
I just want to say
'hi'.
- You know what?
- What?
I like Lia.
- But I'm too shy to tell her.
- I think you just did.
- I told you, not to Milea.
- But I think she heard you.
Insya Allah.
Piyan!
I saw it in
Nandan's eyes.
He felt uncomfortable
with what Dilan said to him.
I'm not an expert
in reading body language.
But Rani said,
he had a crush on me.
But I knew there are lots of girls
who like him in my school.
He is good looking and is
good also at playing basketball.
What are you doing here, Dilan?
- Rani, can I sit here?
- What?
Can I sit here?
Do you have a paper?
May I?
List of guys who wants
to be your boyfriend :
1. Nandan (2-Biology).
2. Aslan.
3. Tobu (3-Social).
4, Acil (2-Physics).
5. Dilan (human being).
Why did you cross out all of them
except your name?
- All of them will fail.
- Except you?
Yeah.
Wish me luck.
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Sir.
So today we will learn
about morphology.
Does anyone know
about morphology?
- No.
- Good.
Because if you already know,
I'm going to have to change the topic.
Hey!
You're not a member of this class.
Come over here.
- What are you doing in this class?
- I entered the wrong class.
- Get out.
- Excuse me, Sir.
Tuck in your shirt!
Class, you should
eat more fish ...
... to nourish your brain and keep you
from forgetting stuff.
Don't be like Abdul. He doesn't even
remember his own class.
It's Dilan, Sir!
His full name is
Abdul Dilan, right?
- I was thinking of giving you a lift.
- No, thanks.
But I changed my mind.
Because I knew you would say that.
- I'm going to your house tonight.
- Please don't. My father is strict.
- Does he bite?
- Seriously, don't come.
I'm not afraid of your dad.
I think he's cool.
- Seriously, why are you doing this?
- I just want to go to your house.
- Thank you, honey.
- You're welcome.
- Bik, can you get the door?
- She's out to the kiosk.
Okay,
I'll get it.
- Assalamu'alaikum, Sir.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
- Who is it?
- A weird boy.
Weird?
- Assalamu'alaikum, Sir.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
???
- Who is he?
- That was weird.
Just some random kid
from Lia's school.
He said he's a messenger
from the canteen.
He thinks he's a prophet?
A messenger?
He said he's promoting their new menu.
"The Three Flavors Batagor."
- Three Flavors Batagor?
- I don't understand kids today.
Maybe he's just crazy.
- Hello.
- Good evening.
- May I speak to Milea?
- Speaking.
It's Dilan.
Hi.
Milea,
I went to your house.
I know. You said you're
a messenger from the canteen.
Because you love to eat.
- Do you know why I went to your house?
- No. Why?
If I didn't come
because I'm scared of your Dad ...
... then I'm a loser.
So I went there.
But if your Dad got angry at me
then that's good too.
- Why?
- Because you'll feel sorry for me.
Was he angry at you?
No, but he said you were already in bed.
and now we're talking on the phone.
Are you sleep walking?
- Where are you?
- Who?
- You.
- You who?
Dilan.
I'm on ...
I'm on Mars.
You're joking, aren't you?
Seriously, I'm on Mars Street near
Margahayu Lane.
- Can I read your future?
- I'm listening.
I can see someday
you're going to be my girlfriend.
- Do you believe me?
- That's againts our religion.
- Milea.
- Yeah.
When you go to sleep tonight,
believe me, I'll be wishing you ...
... a good night's sleep from afar.
You won't hear it though.
Good night, Dilan.
Afternoon paper!
- Miss Lia, this is for you.
- From who?
The paperboy.
???
- Hello.
- Did you get it?
- Get what?
- The chocolate bar, from the paperboy.
I did.
Thank you.
You should thank
the paperboy.
You know what,
I caught two mosquitos last night.
I named them
Boni and Kinkan.
[ 12 : 10 AM ]
Lia.
Wake up.
- What is it, Mom?
- Wake up, honey.
Your friends are here.
They're waiting for you.
Oh my God!
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday ...
... to you.
Blow the candles.
Hold the cake.
Happy Sweet Seventeen, Lia.
This is for you.
Eat your cake.
Thank God, you bought her
expensive cake.
Of course,
special cake for my Milea.
Big boss.
- Do you like it?
- Of course.
???
Hello?
Wrong number.
- Who was that?
- I don't know.
Just a girl calling this late
to a wrong number.
Are you expecting a call
from someone?
No, I thought my mom's already in bed.
I just went there to pick up the phone.
Finish your cake.
I'll see you later, okay?
Give my best to your parents and Airin.
Okay.
Take care of yourself and don't get
too close to the boys from your school.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Thank you for coming all the way
to Bandung. Take care!
- Are you ready, Rev?
- Yup.
Lia's coming!
Happy birthday to you ...
- This is for you.
- Oh my gosh, Nandan!
Do you know
why I give you a teddy bear?
Why?
So you can hug it
when you sleep.
I have to admit that I was
kind of disappointed in Dilan ...
... because he didn't say anything
on my birthday.
And I was waiting
all night for his call.
- I want you all to copy this!
- Yes, Sir.
- Excuse me, Sir.
- Yes?
- There's an important package for Lia.
- Go ahead.
Thank you, Sir.
Happy birthday, Milea.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Sir.
- Whoa.
Don't peek.
Milea, Dilan asked me to give you
this birthday present.
He's wishing you a great one.
He loves you.
Happy Birthday, Milea.
This is your birthday present.
It's just a crossword book that
I've already filled out for you.
I love you. I don't want you to get
a headache from filling them. Dilan.
- Hello.
- Hello, Milea.
I've opened your gift, Dilan.
Alhamdulillah.
Do you like it?
Of course!
It's kind of funny, and weird.
- Milea.
- Yes. Dilan.
- Don't ever tell me if somebody hurt you.
- Why?
Because I will make them
disappear.
- Why is the class next door so noisy?
- The teacher's not in.
Wait, what ...
What's happening?
Dilan!
It's you again!
Piyan!
You're a troublemaker!
It's you again,
troublemakers!
Mr. Suripto.
Both of you,
follow me!
Wati.
Are you dating Piyan now?
Yes.
We're officially dating.
How about Dilan?
Are you close with him?
Because I saw how you hit him
with your book when he broke the wall.
- He's my cousin.
- So you're related to him?
My mother is
the sister of Dilan's father.
- I see.
- He's a naughty kid.
I remember one time ...
I don't remember when.
- But he slaughtered my mom's chicken.
- A chicken?
- He stole it from the coop.
- I can't believe it.
And when my mother confronted him,
he said it was dark.
He thought it was his chicken.
But his father is strict to his children.
He's a soldier, I think.
A soldier?
From which unit?
Don't know.
I just know that he's a soldier.
Why are we talking
about Dilan, anyway?
Nothing.
- Lia.
- Hey, Nandan.
I've never seen you walk to school before.
You're always went by car.
Yeah, I went to school by microbus today
and I will ride the microbus to go home.
The next few days,
Dilan was acting strangely around me.
He seemed different.
I felt like he was pulling away.
I don't know why.
- Piyan.
- Hei, Milea.
Piyan.
How is Dilan doing?
He's good.
Aren't you still calling each other?
It's been a while since our last call.
But before he'd call me almost every night.
- Talking about small stuff.
- It's typical of him.
But how come
he's now snobbish and distant?
I know nothing about that.
But he told me not to bother you.
- He said you and Nandan are dating now.
- What? Can you tell him something?
- Tell him what?
- I'm not dating Nandan.
- Please, tell him I said that.
- All right, I'll tell him.
Lia.
Let's go for lunch.
- I'll pass.
- Let's go, Nan.
- I think I'll pass too.
- Okay. Later, guys.
- Yeah.
- May I sit with you?
Do you think ...
Sorry, I think I need
to go to the restroom. Excuse me.
Oh, okay.
Rani!
Rani.
What's going on there?
Didn't you hear the announcement
on the last period?
- What announcement?
- You've been daydreaming all day.
They're having a selection
fo Quiz Show in the grand hall.
- Quiz Show?
- Yeah. Let's go.
- I'll catch up with you.
- Bye.
- Piyan.
- Milea.
- Did you tell Dilan what I said to you?
- I did.
- What did he say?
- He said, "Oh," and "Yes!"
Really?
Do you know where he is now?
He's trying out for the Quiz Show
in the auditorium.
- Dilan?
- Yeah.
He's representing
2-Physics-1 class.
- Sorry, I have to go to the toilet.
- Okay.
It's time for buzzer round.
Hands on the buzzer.
- Trust me.
- First question.
Who was the Minister of Religious Affairs
in the Fifth Development Cabinet?
- Team B.
- Mahatma Gandhi.
Incorrect.
The correct answer is Munawir Sjadzali.
We'll continue to
the second question.
What is the background
of the transfer of authority ...
... to make laws from the President
to The House of Representatives?
Team B.
I don't know, Sir.
It's too hard.
Minus 200
for Team B.
Calm down. Let me put the list on the board,
and then you can read it yourself.
Insya Allah all your names
are on the list.
Hold on.
List of students selected
to go to TVRI, Jakarta.
Why wasn't I selected
to go to Jakarta?
You'd better stay in Bandung.
It's cooler here.
Jakarta is too hot for us.
Sir.
There's going to be
another program anyway.
Back-Up team :
Jenar, Dilan, Maudi, Cecep, Anggi.
- Udin, Lestari, and who else?
- Ravi and Rudi.
Get in the bus, kids!
We're leaving soon.
- Rani, I'll catch up with you.
- Are you waiting for someone?
I'll be back in a moment.
Get in the bus.
Milea. Get in the bus!
We're leaving now!
Okay.
I should've been happy
to go to Jakarta.
But I was upset when
I found out that Dilan wasn't coming.
I called Benni the night before,
not because I wanted to see him.
But if I didn't tell him that
I was in Jakarta, he'd be furious.
We were so upset leaving Jakarta,
because our team lost the Quiz Show.
I have to go to the toilet,
and find Wati.
- Ran.
- I'll be back in a minute. Wait here.
Lia.
Why are you so quiet?
I'm okay.
- Milea.
- Benni.
I've been looking for you
and here you are.
But last night on the phone
you said you couldn't see me.
But I'm here now.
You have problems with that?
- Just the two of you?
- No, my other friends are here too.
But they were told to ...
To do what?
Sit as couples?
- Why are you doing this, Ben?
- Who is he?
- Hello, I'm Nandan.
- That's Benni.
- Milea's boyfriend, and who are you?
- We're just friends.
- So he's your boyfriend in Bandung?
- Stop it, Benni!
- Fight me! Come on!
- Stop it, Benni!
- Get up! Fight me!
- Enough, Benni!
- I want him to fight me!
- What do you want?
- Are you taking his side?
- He didn't do anything!
- I don't buy that.
- I think you flirted with him.
You're flirty, easy.
Everybody knows that, Lia.
If you want to date him,
say it to my face! Say it!
We're done!
You whore!
What happened, Lia?
Lia!
That's the real Benni,
if you're curious.
You can tell what kind of man he is
to yell at his girlfriend ...
... in public.
Dilan ...
???
Why didn't Dilan
come with us?
Why?
Benni's voice calling me a 'whore'
keeps ringing in my ears.
Going againts Dilan's words ...
"Don't ever tell me if somebody hurt you.
I will make them disappear."
Lia.
Wake up, dear.
Your friends from school
are here.
- Wake up, okay?
- Okay, mom.
- And then what happen?
- For the next sports and art week ...
... they appointed me as Captain
of the basketball team.
- Congrats.
- That's cool.
If we win, we will qualify
to compete in Jakarta.
Phone call from Benni.
Tell him I'm sleeping.
I'm so sorry,
but she's sleeping.
Wish us luck.
I'm going to treat all of you if we win.
- Treat us to what?
- I bet it will be batagor.
I know a good batagor.
It's called Batagor Mang Ihsan.
You're not joking, right?
- Another phone call.
- Who else this time?
- Dilan.
- Are you sure?
I'm sorry guys,
I have to take the call.
Hello.
- Are you sick?
- I was. But I'm fine now.
- Why?
- What do you mean why?
- Why are you sick?
- The doctor said I'm just tired.
It should've been me who eat with you
when they came.
Dilan ...
I'm sorry
I didn't go yesterday.
Don't be sorry.
Anyway, where are you?
- Sekelimus.
- Come on over. Wati's here.
- What is she doing there?
- Just visiting me, with some other guys.
- All right, I'll be right there.
- Bye.
I'm sorry it took so long.
I was getting dressed.
It's okay.
- Assalamu'alaikum.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
- Hey, Bik Asih.
- Miss Wati.
- What are you doing here?
- Somebody told me to come here.
- He said somebody needs a massage
- A massage? Who need a massage?
- He said Miss Melia needs a massage.
- You mean Milea?
- Yes, Milea.
- Who sent you?
Master Dilan.
He drove me here.
But he said he need to stop by a kiosk
to buy crickets.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
And then what happened?
I went to the kiosk with him,
and he met his buddies.
And he said, "Tell them about
dating when you were young."
Look at the time.
Shall we go home?
Okay.
- Assalamu'alaikum.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
- I think I heard Dilan's voice.
- Hang on a second.
You guys are all here.
- We were just about to leave, anyway.
- Why? It's still dizzling outside.
- We've been here since after school.
- Let's go.
We'll see you later.
Bye.
- Thanks for coming.
- Later, guys.
- I'm going to stay here.
- Okay.
- Thanks for sending Bik Asih.
- You're welcome.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to walk them out.
- Do you want to make me happy?
- How?
Don't go outside. It's drizzling.
Stay here with Bik Asih.
I'll walk them out.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Excuse me, Bik.
Okay.
Shall we continue your massage?
We were almost done.
Okay.
- Excuse me, Bik.
- No problem.
- Thank you so much, Bik Asih.
- You're welcome.
- Get well soon.
- Thank you, Bik.
Thank you, Dilan.
???
- Assalamu'alaikum.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
Kissing his hand,
like a wife to her husband.
- Wish me luck, Bik.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Take care, Bik!
Hop on.
Now I'm giving Bik Asih a lift home.
But someday it will be you.
- Is that a foretell?
- That's an offer.
- Bye!
- Take care!
The incident in Jakarta
was not uncommon.
And Benni is only human,
nobody's perfect.
What Haji Rhoma Irama
said is true.
Young blood, is the blood of the youth.
They never feel sorry and very stubborn.
Benni had already admitted his fault. So ...
Can you forgive him too?
He also promised me
to never do that again to you.
I need time to think,
if you don't mind.
Why? Wouldn't it be better if
we settle this thing right now.
Don't rush her.
She needs time to think.
- Mom!
- Dear.
- What?
- Dilan was here earlier today.
What? Did he give you
another crossword book?
No. He brought me a masseuse
and I got a massage, and he left.
I don't understand.
He came here with a masseuse ...
... you got massage,
and he left?
- Yes.
- He's so weird.
Now, I'm curious
about Dilan.
If you were my age,
would you like him?
- I might.
- What do you mean you might?
I might. Because ... if he's controlling
and have temper problem, ...
I definitely
wouldn't like him.
Hello.
Lia, I'm taking a break.
I'm so tired.
- What made you so tired?
- I was studying.
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing. What if I'm laughing?
I like hearing
your laugh.
- Have you eaten yet?
- Have I now?
Hold on.
Excuse me, Maam.
- Who are you talking to?
- A lady who's in line behind me.
Do you want talk to Milea?
She said no.
She's not interested in you.
Tell her,
she'd be sorry.
You'll be sorry, Maam. She's beautiful.
Do you want her number too?
I've changed my mind.
Nevermind, Maam.
- Why not?
- What if she fell in love with you?
But I'm a bit sad right now.
She's been sick for three days.
- I'll be back tomorrow, tell that.
- Tell that to who?
To you!
- I have to go.
- Yeah.
Just don't forget.
- Don't forget about what?
- Don't forget to remember.
Blow a kiss or not?
All right.
- I'd rather not.
- Why not?
I'd rather give you a proper kiss
instead of just a blown one.
All right, then.
Study well, Dilan.
Okay, bye.
- Hello?
- How are you, Babe?
- My name is not Babe!
- I know, you're Lia.
I'm not Lia.
- Then who are you?
- I'm just a whore.
Can you please forgive me?
I said I'm sorry.
- Can we just drop that?
- You're forgiven.
- That means we're still dating?
- No.
But I'm nothing
without you.
I don't want to be
your girlfriend anymore.
Please, Lia.
I need a man who can help me,
not the other way around.
- You should take me the way I am.
- I've already found someone in Bandung.
- I knew it. You're dating him!
- Who?
- That boy I saw in TVRI.
- It's not him.
- Then who is he?
- You don't need to know who he is.
What you need to know is
that I'm breaking up with you.
Bitch!
You whor ...
You're Milea, right?
- I want to read your future again.
- What will you predict?
That we meet again
in the canteen?
No. We're going to meet again,
but this time not in the canteen.
- Where?
- Here.
- Hey, dude.
- Agus, wait.
- What?
- Do you want to ride my bike?
- Why?
- You can give Ravi a lift.
All right.
- Bye.
- Be careful and thanks.
- Why did you let him ride your bike?
- I want to walk with you. Shall we?
Did you know that I've changed
the name of this street?
- What's the name now?
- Milea Street.
More like
Milea and Dilan's Street.
Or Milea and Dilan
the Fortune Teller Street.
Or Milea and Dilan the Fortune Teller
Who Thought About Her Last Night Street.
- Why did you think about me?
- I only think happy thoughts.
Is thinking about me
makes you happy?
Happy and confused.
I'm confused of
how to stop thinking about you.
Do you really want to stop
thinking about me?
- Yeah.
- But why?
I want to be near you all the time,
so then I don't have to think about it.
After you write it down,
read and memorize it.
Yes, Maam.
When you were on sick leave,
I saw Dilan with Susi.
They were on his bike,
together.
- Susi?
- Yeah, Susiana.
- Do you know her?
- We're not friends, I just know her.
She's in 2-Social-2 class.
She's the leader of the rich girls.
Her father owns
a jewelry store.
It's time for recess.
We'll continue on after that.
Yes, Maam.
- Hey, Lia.
- Where's Dilan, Piyan?
- He's not here.
- Do you know where he is?
You can wait for him
here.
I don't know where he is.
Why are you here?
It's nothing. I'd better
go back to class.
Tell him
I'm looking for him.
Why don't you wait him
here?
I can feed you
if you want.
Hey, Lia.
Hey, Honey.
Kids from another school
is attacking our school.
Stay here!
Don't go outside.
- Dilan.
- Lia.
Dilan.
Lia.
- Where have you been?
- Are you okay?
- Where have you been?
- I was around.
- I didn't see you.
- I was behind the church.
- Did you cause this?
- No, I didn't. It was Anhar's fault.
- And you too.
- No Lia.
Anhar beat up a kid
from another school.
What did you do
outside?
Lia.
I was looking for you.
Jerk.
They attacked our school out of nowhere,
I don't know from which school.
- Do you know how many they were?
- They were so many and mostly armed.
Do you know any witness
we can question?
Hold on.
Dilan.
It's okay.
I need you to go with the police
as a witness. Is that okay?
- What did the police say?
- They said I'm cute.
- I'm serious.
- They said, "Don't be so serious."
I thought you were going
to get locked up.
Don't lock up
your feelings.
- Can I ask you about something?
- What?
- Who is Susi?
- She's a girl.
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She wants to be my girlfriend.
I don't.
One time she came to my house,
and I hid in my closet.
- And then?
- Hold on.
She chatted with my mom,
help her cooking.
- I think she wanted my mother to like her.
- And then?
And I couldn't breathe
in the closet.
- And then?
- I need to pee.
Did you pee
in the closet?
- I need to pee, like now.
- Okay, go pee.
Hold on.
Don't hang up.
Hello?
- Are you done?
- Yeah.
- And then?
- She asked me to go see a movie together.
- Did you say yes?
- I did.
- Just the two of you?
- Yes.
During the movie,
I excused myself to the toilet.
- And I left her and went home.
- Was she mad at you?
- She did. Good for me.
- Why is that good for you?
She hates me now.
What if I were mad at you?
Good for me too.
I'd take it as a test.
- A test if I can keep you happy or not.
- I know you can do it.
- It's my job to make you happy.
- Well, you did it.
I've heard that you gave Susi
a lift yesterday.
I did. I took her to a hospital.
Her father was hospitalized.
Poor Susi.
Not in love with someone doesn't mean
you have to hate them, right?
- Right.
- Okay.
- Go to sleep, don't stay up late.
- Can you help me sleep?
- I can.
- How?
- I can make a list of animal names.
- Name them.
1. Lizard.
2. Bear.
3. Giraffe.
4. Tiger.
5. Donkey.
6. Butterfly.
7. Shells.
8. Monkey.
- 9. You.
- Hey!
- You're still awake?
- I am.
10. Koala.
11. Ape.
12. Me.
Don't say anything
before I hang up the phone.
- Okay.
- Go to sleep okay?
I'm sorry if I made
you worry.
I want you to know that I never
want you to worry about me.
Let me worry about you.
Good night
to you too, Dilan.
Student Oath.
In the name of God Almighty.
This is our oath.
One.
I shall have faith in God the Almighty.
Two.
I shall be faithful to Pancasila ...
... and the Constitution of Indonesia.
Three.
I shall obey all the rules ...
... and regulations of my school.
Four.
I shall obey and respect ...
... the teachers and our parents.
Five.
- What did I do?
- You know what you did, don't play dumb.
- Are you disrespecting me?
- I'm just asking, Sir.
Are you disrespecting me?
What are you going to do?
Dilan!
You chicken!
I didn't fight a teacher.
I fight a man named Suripto.
You have to understand.
You know how he is.
I don't want to understand
that kind of teacher.
My mother is a teacher,
and so is my sister.
Whoever he is, if he doesn't
respect other people ...
... he doesn't deserve
respect in return.
I know, Dilan.
Anyone who were not involved in the incident,
please exit the room.
If Lia leaves the room,
so will I.
Okay.
Stay.
Explain to me.
He dragged me by my collar.
As if there are no better ways.
- And don't forget, he slapped me.
- Maybe he wanted to make a point.
A teacher should set examples
for his pupils.
If Suripto dare to slap one of his students,
we have every right to slap him back.
Okay, we're going
to deal with that later.
But we have to punish you
for what you did.
You're going to be
suspended.
I'm not trying to be tough,
I'm just defending myself.
I know, Dilan.
Forgive me.
- Wati.
- Yes, Lia?
- I heard Dilan's mother is here.
- I'm on my way to see her.
- Can I go with you?
- Of course, let's go.
There she is.
Bunda.
- Hey, Wati.
- Bunda.
- And who are you?
- I'm Milea.
This is Milea?
Gosh,
you're so pretty.
Dilan talked about you
so much.
- Where do you live, Milea?
- Batan, Maam.
- How do you go home?
- By angkot.
Today
I'll drive you home.
You too, Wati.
Let's go.
But I promised Piyan
to hang with him after school.
- Your boyfriend?
- Yes.
All right.
But I still can drive you home.
- Don't worry, It's all right.
- Shall we?
Bunda.
- Bye, Lia.
- Bye, Wati.
About Dilan, his mother said we can't
judge a teenager without knowing their life.
Dilan said you like eating dolphins.
He's lying, isn't he?
He is, I don't eat dolphins.
What else did he say about you?
Oh yeah,
he said you have a mustache.
Such a pretty girl like you.
How dare him telling me
you have a mustache. Unbelievable.
- Where is Dilan today?
- He's at home.
Is he calling you 'Bunda'?
Unless ...
he needed money.
- What does he call you?
- 'Bundahara'. (treasurer).
- Can I call you Bunda too?
- Of course you can.
Dilan told me
that you're his girlfriend.
Did he really
say that to you?
Maybe he just thinks
he's your boyfriend.
I can live with that.
Are you from Bandung?
I'm from Aceh, and I follow
my husband back to Indonesia.
Isn't Aceh a part of Indonesia?
I'm just kidding.
I was so happy
I met with Dilan's mother.
I love chatting with her,
My happiness multiplied a million-fold.
- Come in, Bunda.
- Okay.
- Mom.
- Lia.
Hello.
- Mom.
- Yes?
What is it?
- Bunda, this is my mother.
- She's as beautiful as you.
- You're too kind.
- I'm Dilan's mother.
I'm Milea's mother.
You're pretty too.
- And who is this?
- I'm Adi, Lia's tutor.
Excuse me,
I have to pick up the phone.
Let's go inside.
I'll make you some drink.
I don't want to trouble you,
I won't be long.
No trouble at all.
Do you know
who drive me home from school?
- Angkot?
- Not angkot.
It was someone
that I love.
- Mr. Suripto?
- Not him.
- It was your mother. Your Bunda.
- How did that happen?
I'll tell you later.
Tell my Bunda,
don't gossip about me too much.
- Too late.
- Too late for what?
- We already gossiped about you.
- What did she say?
That you told her
I like eating dolphins.
And you told her
I have a mustache.
She said that you ...
What?
And you told her that
I'm your girlfriend.
Dilan,
I miss you.
Me too.
- Who do you miss?
- Dilan.
- I thought you miss me.
- It's too early for that.
Early bloomer.
I'm not kidding,
and he shot them right there.
I know that joke.
- Is it okay if I give you a kiss goodbye?
- Yes, It's okay.
- Is it okay?
- Of course it's okay.
- She's so pretty.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Bunda.
- Why are you crying?
- I'm so happy I met you.
Come here, sweetie.
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.
- Who is this?
- I'm Airin.
She's my
little sister.
Masya Allah, the girls in this house
are all beautiful.
- You're too kind. Say "Thank you".
- Thank you.
I'll see you later. Bye.
Assalamu'alaikum.
- Thank you, Bunda.
- Bye, dear.
Who is she?
My future
mother-in-law.
Pull over!
Hi.
- I went to school today.
- Why?
- I was looking for you.
- I didn't know.
Now you know.
I predicted that you will ride with me
on my bike.
- Do you remember the day I said that?
- I do.
- Can you help me?
- With what?
Help me
make it come true.
- Want to help me?
- Okay.
Do you want to hop on yourself
or do you want me to make you?
Make me.
- Will you please ride with me, Milea.
- What if I don't want to?
You'd break your promise.
You already said that you'd help me.
- All right.
- Shall we?
- We're going to drive around.
- Drive around where?
You don't need to know.
As long as we're together.
- Are we going or what?
- Sure, why not?
- Wait, don't hug me.
- Okay, I won't.
- Unless you want to.
- I want to.
It was the first time I rode
on the combat commander's bike.
I didn't know where he took me,
I let him decide.
That's a tree.
That's the sky.
That's Mang Jajang.
- Do you really know him?
- No, I just call him Mang Jajang.
That afternoon with Dilan,
if there were a happiness meter ...
... I would count as
the happiest girl in the world.
Thank you.
I respect people who named
their meatball dish ...
... with our heroes' name.
This is called meatballs Yamin.
Honoring our hero "Muhammad Yamin."
- How about meatball soup?
- Meatbal soup is honoring ...
- Honoring who?
- Honoring today.
Look at that guy.
Don't stare.
He keeps holding
his girlfriend's hands.
I think he doesn't want her to
disappear.
- Don't laugh.
- Why not?
You have a cute laugh.
I don't want him to like you.
I'm going to laugh now,
I want him to like me.
Whatever.
I might end up beating him up.
- Why?
- Fighting over you.
I hope you win.
- For you. - Thank you.
- Safe some for later.
- For tomorrow?
- For tonight.
Eat half here, and bring the other half home
for your dinner.
- Are you serious?
- I am.
Okay,
then I'll break it in half.
Can I have
a plastic bag please?
Thanks for the ride home.
- Whose car is that?
- It's Kang Adi's.
- Kang Adi?
- He's my tutor.
Okay,
see you later.
Lia,
you're home late.
I brought you something.
Where have you been?
Kang Adi has been
waiting for you so long.
I went out with Dilan.
If you want to be home late,
you should call first.
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Eat your dinner and take shower.
Then study with Kang Adi, okay?
- Lia, have you heard?
- About what?
Dilan's gang is going
to attack another school.
Are you serious?
They're going to payback
the kids who beat up Anhar.
Let's go quickly, or
Mr. Ruslan will notice we're not in his class.
Okay.
Wati.
Will you go with me
to Bik Eem's later?
- On recess?
- Yeah.
He's their combat commander.
He's our main target.
- Dilan.
- Lia?
- Can I sit here?
- Okay.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to drive around with you.
- When?
- Now.
- Now?
- Yeah.
- We still have another classes.
- We'll ask permission to leave early.
- How about tomorrow?
- I want now.
I can't right now.
I have other plans.
I want to drive around
with you right now.
- Okay.
- I'm going to get my bag. Stay here.
There's no benefit in fighting, Dilan.
It's a no-win situation.
- Where do you want to go?
- Your house. I want to see Bunda.
- She's at work until sunset.
- We can drive around to kill time.
Okay.
This area is owned by Kang Atep.
I know him.
- So if you want to scream, you can.
- I don't want to scream.
Or if you want to say "I love you",
you can.
- Tell it to who?
- To me.
- You first.
- Tell it to who?
- Me, silly.
- Tell you what?
- I love you!
- Darn, she beat me to it!
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- How much are these per kg?
- Five hundred rupiahs.
Five hundred rupiahs?
Hold on.
One kg, please.
This is for Nandan's girlfriend.
Thanks.
- What?
- Tell Nandan I say hello.
Silly!
If my Bunda asks us
where we have been all day ...
... tell her that
we went to Egypt.
- Why?
- So she won't believe us.
- And act like you couldn't talk.
- Why would I do that?
So my bunda would ask you,
"Why are you so quiet?"
- And then?
- And I'd say, "I told her to."
And she'd say, "Why do you let him
boss you around?"
And I'd say,
"He made me do it."
And I'd just,
"I'm sorry, Bunda."
And your Bunda would say
"That's unforgivable."
Then she cursed me
into a stone.
And she'd threw
the stone to the river.
- And disappeared.
- And I'd get so sad.
- And you'd try to find the stone.
- And then I'd found it.
And you'd carry that stone
around with you.
- Why?
- So that you don't have a stomachache.
"Beware of
The Dog Owner"
Bunda,
there's a debt collector outside.
Come on in.
Bunda!
There's a pretty girl
in my house.
Assalamu'alaikum, Bunda.
Wa'alaikumsalam, of course.
- I miss you, Bunda.
- I know. I miss you too.
- What's that?
- We bought you some groceries.
In that case,
let's go to the kitchen.
- Bik.
- Yes, Maam?
Can you wash this,
please?
What is
Dilan's favorite food?
Dilan?
Let me think.
I think
you're his favorite.
- Can you pick up the phone, please?
- Yes, Maam.
Hello?
He's here. Hold on.
Dilan,
it's for you.
- Who?
- Anhar.
Hello?
Yes. Okay.
Bunda, I have to go out for a bit.
Lia, stay with my mother.
- Where are you going?
- There's something I need to do.
I'll go with you!
- Stay here with my Bunda.
- I'm going with you.
All right.
It can wait.
It doesn't matter,
I'd still go with you if you leave.
I know.
- Assalamu'alaikum.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
- Meet my sister.
- Hi, I'm Disa.
Lia.
- Do you know my full name?
- What?
Disaaa.
Do you want to know
the longer version?
- What?
- Disaaaa.
Okay, I'm exhausted after school.
I'll be in my room.
- Where's Banar?
- He's in his room.
Do you want me to call him
or are you going to call him?
I'll do that.
- Thank you, Bunda.
- Dig in.
- I'm waiting for Dilan.
- Dilan.
I'm coming.
Let's eat.
- I already ate in at school.
- The merrier the better.
Give me a small portion.
You need to know.
This is Banar.
He's Dilan's big brother.
And he has another brother.
His name is Landin.
- He's not home yet.
- But I thought you have five chidren.
My eldest daughter is a teacher.
She lives with his husband now.
- Thank you, Bunda.
- Here's the sambal.
Thank you, Bik.
- Have the chicken, Lia.
- Yes, Bunda.
Maybe Dilan is not perfect boyfriend.
But at least he's not rude.
He always makes me laugh and smile,
and motivates me to get up in the morning ...
... just to make sure he's still alive.
Bunda.
Do you want a tour
to his room?
I do,
but is that okay?
Of course.
There's so many books
in his room.
"In order to make the peace,
we must fight for it." - Ronald Reagen.
His room is messy.
Why don't
we clean his room?
Okay.
- Lia.
- Yes, Bunda.
Dilan loves to write poetry.
Do you want to read them?
Is that okay?
I won't mind.
But don't tell Dilan.
All right, Bunda.
Sit here.
I've read one with
"Milea" on the title.
Which one?
This one.
Milea 1
Can I share my view?
About she who walks on earth.
The day God created her.
I think God just wanted to show me.
Milea 2
Tell me, if you're a dessert.
What would you be?
A chocolate cake? A cheese cake?
A martabak? A croquette? A fritter?
Come on,
I want to order you for tonight.
I want you.
Dilan, Bandung 1990
I love them!
Did Dilan have
a girlfriend before?
Girlfriend like you?
No one like you.
If you were me, when a boy
wrote you poetry like this ...
... how would you feel?
I'd thank his mother ...
... for showing me his poetry
without his permission.
Thank you, Bunda!
It's late.
Is your mom okay with that?
Bunda had already called my mom
when you were sleeping.
I see.
- Dilan.
- Hmm?
Have you cried before?
I have. When I was a baby
and wanted milk.
I mean when you were older.
Have you?
- It's not hard to make me cry.
- How?
If you disappear off the face
of the earth.
- Did you and your bike gang plan an attack?
- I was with you all day and night.
If you weren't with me,
would you go with them?
- I don't want you involved in any attack.
- Okay, Lia.
Promise me you won't go with them
if they're planning an attack.
I promise.
Do you know what will happen
if you decided to go with them anyway?
- What?
- I will disappear off the face of the earth.
It's Kang Adi.
I'll see you later.
I'm done.
So, when can I take you
for a tour around my campus?
- You said you'd like to see ITB
- Maybe later.
This is for you.
- What is this?
- Open it.
This pashmina is expensive.
There are a lot of cheaper ones.
But you deserve
the expensive one.
Thank you.
So, when do you want to go?
How about tomorrow?
Next Sunday?
Have you checked the answers?
Are they all correct?
Hello.
- It's for you.
- From who?
It's Dilan.
Excuse me.
I have to take the call.
Okay.
- Hello.
- Hello, Lia.
- Are you home yet?
- Not yet.
Is Kang Adi still there?
Yeah. He wants to take me on
a tour around ITB tomorrow.
- Like when I went out with Susi?
- What do you mean?
I went out with Susi
and you got jealous.
Are you jealous that
I will go out with Kang Adi?
- Jealousy is for the insecure.
- So?
So tonight
I'm feeling insecure.
I'll get over it
tomorrow, maybe.
I won't go with him then.
I won't keep you from going out
with him, though.
But you're feeling insecure tonight.
I won't go with him. I promise.
- Go to bed. Don't stay up late.
- You too.
- And don't miss me.
- Why not?
It's too heavy.
You won't be able to.
Let me bear it
for you.
By the way.
Can you buy me two duty stamps tomorrow?
- What for?
- Just buy them for me.
- Okay.
- Sleep tight, Lia.
- What do you need that BB gun for?
- For shooting rats on the street.
Dad's is already up.
Mom's back.
Here. It's your favorite meatballs.
Bring it inside.
Okay.
Morning, Dad.
- What time did you get home last night?
- Around 12 o'clock.
- Assalamu'alaikum.
- Wa'alaikumsalam.
- Lia. Uncle.
- Kang.
I want to take Lia
for a tour around my campus, the ITB.
Sure.
Get ready, Lia.
Sorry.
But I can't.
- Why didn't you call me to make sure?
- He did, but you weren't home.
And I said "yes".
Go.
Get ready.
- Can we make it a short tour?
- Okay.
I felt trapped in a situation
where I didn't have any choice ...
... but to go with
Kang Adi.
And I prayed Dilan wouldn't
find out about it.
I didn't want to upset him,
because I lied to him.
[ ITB ]
- Thank you, Kang.
- You're welcome, Lia.
- Miss Lia.
- Yes, Bik.
- There was a phone call for you.
- From who?
- Dilan.
- Then what did you say to him?
I told him
you went out with Kang Adi.
Oh my God!
- Hello.
- Good afternoon, Bunda.
This is Lia.
Is Dilan home?
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- Do you know where he went?
He didn't tell me
where he was going.
I'll let him know that you called
once he gets back.
- He'll call you back.
- Okay. Thanks, Bunda.
You're welcome, sweetie.
Milea 1
Can I share my view?
About she who walks the earth.
The day God created her.
I think God just wanted to show me.
Dilan, Bandung 1990.
Milea 2.
Tell me, if you're a desert.
What would you be?
A chocolate cake?
A cheese cake?
A martabak? A croquette?
A fritter?
Come on,
I want to order you for tonight.
I want you.
Dilan, Bandung 1990.
I won't go with him.
I promise.
Forgive me, Dilan.
The home that Dilan and I built together
suddenly collapsed in a blink of an eye.
I spent all day reading the poetry
I copied from his notebook ...
... when Bunda sneaked me
into his room.
He didn't call me
again tonight.
I felt ashamed
for lying to him.
I have to see him
and explain everything to him.
- Lia.
- Piyan.
Are you controlling
Dilan's life now?
Do you really need
to be with him all the time?
She's clingy
as hell.
What do you want
from me?
I'm talking to Anhar!
What?
Are you talking to me?
Let's go, Lia.
- Let's go, Lia.
- I'm not finished with him.
Yeah, get her out of here.
She's looking for trouble here.
Don't fight!
Lia.
Let's go.
What happened to her?
Lia.
- What happened, Lia?
- Piyan, what happened to her?
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything.
- She ...
- She what?
It was ...
Forgive me, Lia.
What?
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Don't lie to me.
- I said I didn't mean to do that.
Forgive me, Lia.
I didn't mean ... to slap you.
- What?
- Did you say you slapped her?
- It was an accident.
- Why did you slap her?
- Lia.
- You're a dead meat, you know that.
- Lia, will you forgive me?
- Leave her alone! Get lost!
I was so upset that day.
I don't like Susi,
and I hate Anhar.
Let go of me.
I'm sorry, Dilan.
There's a duel outside.
You jerk.
Dilan.
- Dilan, stop it!
- Break it up!
- He started it.
- Anhar, stop!
Enough, Dilan!
Enough!
Enough!
That's enough, Dilan!
Calm down, Dilan.
Tell me what happened.
If Anhar or even 
the principal ever lay a hand on Lia, ...
I will burn this school
down to ash!
Calm down, Dilan.
Sit down.
Will you calm down?
Tell me what
was that all about?
All clear.
Oh my God! What happen to your face?
Did you have a fight?
Just a little.
- Can you give him some drink?
- What do you want?
- Just water.
- Okay.
- Here you go.
- Drink it.
I'm going to get you some iodine
for the cuts.
- I'm okay, Bik.
- It's okay.
It's just some iodine.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Stay here.
- Did you eat?
- Not yet.
I'm asking about yesterday.
Did you eat?
- No.
- Aren't you hungry?
- Where were you this morning?
- I overslept.
- And then?
- And I beat up Anhar.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
No problem.
- I'll be inside, it's time for praying.
- Be careful.
What could happen to me inside?
Come here.
- I don't think using iodine will work.
- It's better than leave them untreated.
Unless you kiss them.
- Do you want me to kiss you?
- I do.
- Did it work?
- Instantly.
I came here
looking for you this morning.
I wanted to explain why
I went with Kang Adi yesterday.
- You don't need to.
- But I lied to you.
- I don't want to upset you.
- Nobody wants to be lied to.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
- Do you want to go somewhere?
- What do you mean?
- Do you want to go somewhere now?
- Where?
- To the Religious Affairs Office?
- What for?
Just hanging outside the building.
Warming up.
- Did you buy the duty stamps?
- I did. But why do you need them for?
Just give them to me.
Do you have a notebook?
I do.
Read it.
I did, I was watching you
when you wrote that.
- Read it out loud.
- Why don't you do that instead?
Declaration!
Today, Bandung, December 22, 1990.
Dilan and Milea, hereby sincerely
declare that we're officially dating.
Matters which concern perfecting
and keeping the fire burning ...
... in our relationship will be executed
in the longest possible time.
- Your turn.
- Yes.
Keep it.
Are we still going
somewhere or what?
- What does it mean?
- Let's go.
That was my love story with Dilan
when I lived in Bandung years ago.
And tonight, at home,
is another lonely night in Jakarta.
This yearning is like a single droplet
in the ocean of yearnings within me.
Continuously flowing like the rivers,
and crashing like the waves.
It's unstoppable.
It is as powerful as life,
and active.
On the streets of Buah Batu,
I felt like I was on top of the world.
With Dilan, who taught me
that true love gives you comfort, ...
... confidence, and support.
I don't care if you
don't agree with me.
But that's Dilan.
My Dilan.
My love.
And that is all.
I ask for nothing else.
