On Friday 22 July 2011, Norway
was hit by two terrorist attacks.
First a bomb detonated
in the government quarter of Oslo.
This is followed by a massacre
at the Norwegian Labour Party's Youth
League summer camp
on the island of Utoya.
The perpetrator was a 32-year-old
ethnic Norwegian right-wing extremist.
22July 2011
Oslo
3:17 p.m.
The island of Utoya,
40 km northewest of Oslo.
5:06 p.m.
You'll never understand.
Just... listen to me.
Okay ?
Yes, but that's why it's important
we're here.
Yes, mom, I understand. But...
But we're on an island.
It's the safest place in the world.
There's nothing to worry about.
Emilie ?
No...
No, she's not around right now.
Should I just say hello from you,
then ?
Yes.
Her battery may just be dead.
Yes, I guess so.
Let's talk later, then.
OK, I will.
Ok. Bye. Love you. Bye.
- Have you heard anything else ?
- No, I talked to our neighbor.
She just said that no one was home.
Emilie ?
Emilie ?
You'll be fine, right ?
Wait here. I'll be back.
- Are you coming to the main hall ?
- Yes, but just go on ahead.
Hi !
Didn't you hear me calling you ?
- We were just swimming !
- I can see that.
Don't !
Emilie, what is this mess ?
Are you having a party ?
No. It's just Emilie being a pain
in the ass and messy.
- Can you help me ?
- Sure.
- Are they yours ?
- You're welcome to dig in.
Petter !
You could've told me
the bag was open !
- How did it taste ?
- It's like mashed potatoes.
- Want some ?
- I don't need mushy chips in my hair.
- Are you coming or what ?
- Yes, soon.... Just go ahead.
- But, when ?
- Later. I don't know. Just go.
Are you just going to leave
all this on the ground ?
Is that just ok ?
Hey, stop that !
Is it so hard to show
some consideration ?
- Relax, I'll hang them up afterwards.
- That's not what I mean.
People are in shock and you just come
along shouting like it's a party ?
Oh, poor you !
Did I embarrass you ?
No. But...
It doesn't look good.
I couldn't give a shit how it looks.
All right...
Sorry for having a bit of fun.
Do you have any idea
what's happened ?
I went for a swim !
Oda's mom works
in those government buildings.
OK, well, I didn't know.
Typical.
- What do you mean ?
- You're always so perfect.
What ?
I'm just saying that you could
show some consideration.
Of course, mom.
Mom tried to call you a thousand times.
Why didn't you answer ?
- Everything I do is wrong !
- Emilie...
First, you tell me I have to get to
know people. But now that's wrong too.
That's not what I said.
- I should never have come.
- No, come on.
If you hadn't begged me.
Emilie, don't be like that now.
Please.
Why don't you just go and play
your guitar
or create world peace or something ?
Now you're just being childish.
So, I'm childish, then !
Excuse me !
Sorry.
Come up there with me.
Please.
There's going to be a barbecue
and stuff.
- And stuff...
- OK, forget it then.
And that sweater is mine, you know.
Hey, do you have the time ?
Hello ! The time ?
10.
Did I miss Gro ?
Have you been sleeping
all this time ?
My mobile died.
- So, you haven't heard ?
- Heard what ?
A bomb went off in Oslo.
Seriously ?
There was an explosion
where the government buildings are.
- Was it terrorism, or what ?
- I don't know.
- Shit !
- Yes.
- They've got a big screen at the café.
- Hey, wait up !
- Hi, Magnus. I'm new here.
- Hi. Kaja.
- Nice.
- Yeah, real nice.
Magnus, do you have
the deck of cards ?
Yes.
Thanks. Talk to you later.
So, how can I get online ?
You can try inside. But the coverage
is bad everywhere here.
OK, but can I charge my phone
as well ?
- Yes, there are outlets there.
- Okay. Where ?
- You've been in the main hall, right ?
- Yes.
Well, it's right over...
OK, but where in the main hall ?
Oh, sorry.
Just inside to the left, there are
plenty of places to charge your phone.
- I'll see you later, then.
- What ?
I'll come up afterwards.
Once I've charged my mobile.
Yeah. OK.
She called. None of them were
in the city when it went off.
That's great news !
- Aren't you happy ?
- Sure.
So be happy then !
You don't look very happy.
- Is everything OK ?
- Yes. Everyone is OK.
I actually knew that she wasn't at work
but...
Kaja ? I can't eat both.
Want one ?
- Oh, can I have it ?
- Why don't I get a waffle ?
- Should we just go home, or what ?
- No. No one is going home.
I don't like to be so far away
from everything.
Relax ! This is a summer camp.
It's fun...
There's nothing you can do
at home anyway.
Just enjoy yourself while you're here.
Don't let this ruin everything.
We're going to have a barbecue,
chill... And then there's the dance !
Check out Issa,
he's just itching to dance.
- Hello, it's been cancelled.
- Seriously ?
Well, it's not that strange.
OK, then I'll just have to dance solo.
Al capella. I'll put on a show for you.
Al capella ? It's "A capella",
you know.
- Not in Spanish.
- Fool.
- Let's sit down over there.
- Yes, see you.
- I just hope it wasn't a Muslim group.
- No one is saying that.
No, but if...
It's going to be hell.
We don't even know if it was terrorism.
It could have been a gas explosion.
Didn't someone mention pipes ?
Gas pipes ? Under the government
building complex ?
You never know.
It wasn't a gas explosion. This is mad.
Terrorism on Norwegian soil.
- And you are...
- Magnus. From Stavanger.
Hi. Caroline.
- Did you find the outlets ?
- Yes, they were easy to spot.
But the government building complex...
It could be Al Qaeda or something.
- Al Qaeda ?
- No, that's ridiculous !
We don't know anything !
It's silly to start guessing.
You can't just blame Al Qaeda
for everything.
He's just saying
what's on everyone's mind.
Not mine.
No one thinks that, Issa.
I mean everyone else out there.
Hey. I was just thinking about
Afghanistan and stuff.
What do you mean by Afghanistan ? That
this has something to do with the war ?
- It's like Jonas was saying yesterday.
- What war ?
- There is no war.
- Kaja, we are at war, you know.
It's not war.
They're peacekeeping forces.
Our soldiers are shooting people too.
They're working for safety
and stability.
Safety ?
That's a whole
other debate anyway.
The people of Afghanistan
couldn't care less
what the Norwegian Prime Minister
calls it. War is war.
- I stopped paying attention.
- Those two always argue.
- No, we don't.
- But, we are at war.
Petter... this doesn't have to be
related. That's what Issa means.
I'm talking about Afghanistan,
not Oslo. And Issa agrees with me.
- Stop. I'm staying out of this.
- But you're the one who said it !
Petter ! Seriously !
Can't we have a discussion here ?
Isn't that why we're here ?
Petter. Try to calm down !
What about that barbecue ?
Are there sausages ?
- You're eating a waffle !
- Yes, but I want a sausage.
Kaja...
A peace offering ?
Peace waffle ? From my heart.
I have two peace waffles of my own,
but thanks anyway.
Snuff then ? Peace snuff.
No ! That smells terrible !
Get it away !
Have a peace snuff !
Should I enjoy it myself ?
It won't affect your body odor much.
Fire crackers ?
That was no fire crackers.
- What's going on ?
- What's up ?
- Kristine, relax. It's OK.
- What's happening ?
This is not cool.
Can you knock it off ?
- What's happening ?
- Run !
Inside ! Get inside ! Go !
Inside, come on !
Go and hide !
Close the door !
Hey, you guys. Get inside !
Caroline, what's going on ?
Move in ! Go further in !
Go further in !
Move in !
Come here.
- Close the door, damn it !
- You can't come in now !
Lock it ! Lock it !
Move further in !
I can't stay in here.
I need to get out !
No. Sit back down !
Caroline, Emilie is in the tent.
I have to find her.
No, you can't go out.
Please.
No, sit down !
Sit down !
- I must know where she is, please !
- Be quiet.
Be quiet !
- Petter, have you seen Emilie ?
- No.
- Kaja ! I want to go home !
- Kristine, be quiet.
Be quiet !
- Do you know where the others ran ?
- I don't know, I just ran.
Be quiet.
Emilie is in the tent.
Emilie is in the tent.
Sit down !
Sit down !
- Does someone know what's happening ?
- I don't know.
They're coming this way !
Kristine, get it together !
Don't leave me !
You have to run yourself.
I can't drag you !
Kristine, run !
I can't support you, OK !
You have to run, Kristine !
What the fuck was that ?
No idea.
I have no clue what's happening.
- Was that gunfire ?
- Are they shooting people ?
Must be some kind of drill.
But it was total chaos.
Maybe they're teaching us to deal
with panic ?
If so,
then we're really not doing well.
Have you seen Emilie ? My sister ?
People were just trampling me.
I was in my tent and then everyone just
started screaming.
Were you at the campsite ? Did you see
her ? Yellow sweater ? Blonde hair ?
Oh, God.
I must find her. I must find her.
There is gunfire everywhere. There's
no place to hide. It's everywhere.
Still it might be a drill.
Pull yourself together.
It was gunfire.
Issa, it'll go fine. Relax.
I've heard gunshots before.
This is no drill.
Can someone call the police ?
I have to call my sister.
- Are you calling the police ?
- No, my sister.
It's 112 ?
That boy.
He was just lying there...
- What about him ?
- Was he... I mean...
He wasn't dead, was he ?
I can't get through to the police.
Goddammit,
why doesn't anyone pick up ?
My foot, I think it's broken.
Shut up !
Stop with that damn whining !
Emilie, its Kaja. Call me, OK ?
Just call me.
- Kaja, she'll be fine. It's OK.
- Oh, God !
Come on. Call.
Emilie ?
- Are they picking up ?
- It's just beeping.
If this was serious,
they'd answer the phone, right ?
Has it stopped ?
This island is way too small.
There are no places to hide.
Be quiet.
Hello...
Hello...
We're out on Utøya.
Someone is shooting at us.
- Someone is shooting on Utøya.
- Say that people are hurt.
Yes, people are hurt here.
No, not me,
but we can hear it.
No, I haven't seen...
I haven't seen anyone get shot.
Hi, this is Petter Ligard. Is there
some kind of drill on Utøya ?
But you can find out, right ?
OK.
OK. Thanks.
- What the fuck ?
- They're on the way.
- I was talking to them.
- They said to just stay put.
- You can't just take my phone !
- I'm just trying to help !
- Be quiet !
- Oh, God !
Turn off your mobile.
Put it on silent.
Imagine if they come.
- Did they say how long it would take ?
- Just that they were on the way.
- Oh, God. Oh, God !
- Just shut up !
This is not a drill.
We can't just lie here and wait.
Can you stop being so negative !
What do you think we should do ?
Not sit here !
There is no point in scaring people.
They said they're on the way,
and that we should hide.
Let's just stay put and wait ! OK ?
What's going on ?
They're shooting.
They're shooting everywhere.
Ole... He just fell down.
Who's shooting ?
Who's shooting ?
The police.
The police are doing the shooting.
The police are shooting people.
The police ?
But why are the police
shooting people ?
Were there lots of them, or what ?
Were there lots ?
I do not know. I think so.
Did you see anything else ?
Were a lot of people getting shot ?
- Yes. Lots.
- Oh, God !
I can't just sit here and wait
to get shot.
What can we do if it's the police ?
That doesn't make sense !
But he just said that the police
are the shooters.
We have to get down to the water.
Then we'll swim if we have to.
- It's way too far.
- It depends on where we swim from.
It can't be more than ten degrees
in the water.
You'll be dead in ten minutes.
- We can't just sit here !
- They can pick us up in boats too !
Who's coming ?
We'll help each other.
This island is way too small.
There are no places to hide.
It's not that cold.
Emilie went swimming.
It's not the same.
I'm coming.
They said we should hide.
At least we're hidden here.
You heard what he said.
They're going to find us.
They're going to find us.
We've got to get moving.
Kaja, what should we do ?
We have no other choice, Petter.
Do you hear me ?
OK, if you're going, I'm going.
OK, you guys,
if they start shooting again, we'll run
the opposite way to the water.
OK ? Let's wait for the next gunshot.
Turn off that phone !
Turn off the sound.
Turn it off !
You can't talk on the phone now !
Mom ?
Oh, God...
Mom ?
Someone is shooting at us.
Someone is shooting on Utøya.
- What are you saying ? Who is firing ?
- I don't know who it is.
Kaja.
Take care of yourself. Kaja, dear.
Try to hide.
Yes, we're hiding.
What is going on ? Who is shooting ?
You are careful, right ? Are you hurt ?
No, I'm not hurt.
But they're shooting at us.
- My god, are you hurt ?
- No, I'm not shot. I'm not hurt.
- Is anyone hurt ? Where is Emilie ?
- Emilie ?
- Yes, where is Emilie ? Kaja ?
- I can't talk anymore.
I have to hang up, OK ?
Ok. Now ! Come on, quick.
Kaja, where are you going ?
Kaja !
Hello ?
Come.
Are you OK ?
Has something happened ?
Come on.
- I'm waiting for Jonas.
- Who is Jonas ?
My brother.
- What happened to your brother ?
- He told me to come here.
You can't sit here.
He's coming.
- To the tent ?
- He's coming.
- Come on. You have to run.
- He told me to come here.
You can't sit here.
They can see you from way off.
You can't sit here. Do you hear me ?
Do you hear what I'm saying ?
But, Jonas...
Jonas is not here ! Do you hear me ?
Come on. You have to stay safe.
- What's your name ? What's your name ?
- Tobias.
OK, Tobias. Listen to me.
I'm going to tell you what Jonas wants
you to do, OK ? Can you listen to me ?
Jonas wants you to hide.
Run into the forest. Can you do that ?
It's not far.
Can you do it ?
And take off your jacket.
You have to take that jacket off.
You must hide. Can you do that ?
Come on, you can do it.
That's it. Run !
You have to run, don't walk !
And take off your jacket !
Emilie ?
Emilie ?
OK.
Mommy...
Mom ? Mom.
I can't find Emilie !
Do you hear me ?
I can't find Emilie.
I don't know where she is.
I'm sorry.
No. She wasn't there.
Mom.
Mommy ? I'll find her, OK ?
I cannot loose you. Now you have to
take care of yourself.
Yes.
Yes, but I will find her.
Mom, I can't talk anymore.
Don't call me, OK ?
Mommy...
I love you and Dad, OK ?
- Come on.
- No, I can't do it.
There. I'm going to find someone
who can help you, OK ?
- No, don't go. Please.
- I'll come back.
Are you OK ?
He shot me.
I ran and then he shot me.
Can you sit up ?
- What ?
- Nothing.
- Is it bad ?
- No.
It will be fine.
Will you be OK for a while ?
Please. Don't go.
Please, don't go.
What if I die ? What if I die today ?
It's just your shoulder.
You won't die from that.
I don't know. I don't feel so good.
They're coming now.
Someone will help you.
Did you talk to them ?
Are you sure ?
- They're on their way. I promise.
- Yes. OK ?
- Can you just stay here a bit ?
- Yeah, where else would I go ?
- It's so cold.
- What ?
- I'm freezing.
- You're freezing ?
- If I die...
- You're not dying.
Could you tell my mom I was thinking of
her ? That I love her. I love everyone.
You're not going to die.
You're going to go home.
I want my mommy.
- What's her name ?
- Torill.
Is she at home ?
- She's at the cabin.
- Where's that ?
- Austevoll.
- Austevoll. Is that out west ?
Is it nice there ?
Is it by the sea ?
Yes, that's nice.
Tell me more about
what you do there.
Erik...
- What did you say ?
- He...
- Are you OK ? Hello ?
- Coming...
What are you trying to say ?
Don't fall asleep. Hello !
Who's Erik ? Is he your brother ?
- Is he your boyfriend ?
- We...
- You... Yes ? Keep going.
- ...take the Toyota.
Come on !
Keep going.
Are you and Erik going to the cabin ?
Are you taking the Toyota together ?
To the west coast ? Come on...
Smoke.
Hey, come on...
Don't fall asleep.
Can you hear me ?
Hey, are you OK ?
Hey ? What's happening ?
I want my mommy.
Just hang on a bit
and you can go home to your mom.
It'll be OK.
I think it's stopped bleeding.
That's good.
Hey, are you OK ? Hey... You ?
Hey ! You...
Hello !
Hey !
Are you there ?
No, no.
No, please stay with me.
No, please stay. No.
Come on, now !
You...
What's your name ?
Come on, I don't even know your name.
Come on !
Come on !
Kaja. Hi.
Oh, my God.
Caroline, come.
Hey, come now !
Kaja, I know her.
- Caroline, come on.
- Kaja, I know her.
We've got to get away from here.
Hey ! Come here !
- We're going to be seen.
- No, there's no room here.
- Of course, there's room.
- No.
Are you OK ?
Are you hurt ? Hello ?
I just ran. Just there.
It's just like me. I wasn't even
supposed to be here.
I only came to pick up girls.
I'm going to shut up now.
Why is nobody coming to help us ?
We've been sitting here forever
and we haven't seen a single boat.
Why ?
They'll be here soon.
No.
Forget it.
I'm not going out there.
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to swim from here.
- Even, we must out !
- I don't want to swim !
Forget it.
A boat will come soon.
Who ?
The police ?
Hey, look ! Even.
There are boats out there.
Why aren't they coming closer ?
Why are they just sitting out there ?
Why is no one coming to help us ?
Did you run with the others ?
No. I had to find my sister.
- You didn't find her ?
- No.
Do you have your mobile ?
Yes.
What for ?
Call her then.
Find a cat video.
Or something like that.
It's not funny.
Not funny at all.
Stop it !
Just stop it !
Stop.
- Even ! We have to go with them !
- No. No, don't go !
You can do whatever the fuck you like.
But I am going to survive this.
Silje ?
Don't do it, I'm serious !
Should we also ? Swim ?
No. I have to find my sister.
It's too late to look for her now.
It'll be OK. Let's just take it easy
here for now.
They'll find her afterwards.
Or you'll find her afterwards.
I didn't really want to swim anyway.
What are you going to do
when you get home ?
Imagine if I were home.
No, well... OK then.
I'd take a bath.
I'd take a nice hot bath.
A bath ?
You can bathe right here.
Go ahead.
The mood's just right.
I would buy a massive kebab.
A kebab ?
There's this great kebab shop
in Stavanger.
Seriously, the best in the country.
The hotter the better. Extra chilli.
My treat.
What do you say ? Seriously,
it's the best in the country.
Will you come with me ?
- Kebab ?
- Please.
Yes.
Yes ?
What else are you going to do
when you get home ?
What ?
Ten things to do before you die.
You first.
- Come on, stop it.
- Come on. Ten things !
- You can do that.
- Before I die ?
I'm going to...
I want to see a Premiere League final
with Man United.
- Premiere League ?
- Live. VIP seats.
- I'm going to be an MP.
- What ?
- I want to get into parliament.
- Well, that's typical !
Okay. And why's that ?
You're just... the type that everyone
would vote for.
I'm a...
I'm a loser.
What about you ?
What are you going to be ?
A celebrity.
Or an actor. Or both.
Yeah, right.
What else ?
I'm going to get married.
I hope I'll have two kids.
Why two ?
We're four.
That's a lot. I mean, four boys...
Think of poor mom.
We're just two.
Emilie and me.
OK, Prime Minister Kaja.
What else ?
Come on.
You must like something other than just
arguing with Petter and those guys.
- I sing in a choir.
- Seriously ?
- Something wrong with that ?
- No.
No. That's good.
Sing a bit, then.
- No.
- Please. Go ahead.
Please.
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
I realize It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid
To let them show
Your true colors
True colors
True colors
Kaja ? Is that you ?
Is that you singing ?
- Oda ?
- Up here.
- I can't see you.
- Where ?
Have you seen Emilie ?
She was where we went
swimming yesterday.
Oh, my God !
Kaja ?
Kaja, get it together.
Come here !
Kaja !
Emilie ! Emilie !
No.
Oh, please !
I told him to take off that jacket.
Can you see the boat ? Kaja !
Help is coming ! Do you understand ?
Please, just let me go.
Help is coming ! Do you understand ?
Please, pull yourself together.
- He didn't make it.
- It's not your fault.
None of this is your fault. OK ?
It's not going to help anyone
if you die, right ?
It won't do any good, OK ? You're going
to be the prime minister, Kaja !
I'm going to vote for you.
I'll be part of your cabinet.
Magnus ! Magnus !
The attack on Utoya lasted
for 72 minutes.
77 people were killed in the attacks.
99 were seriously injured, and over 300
suffered massive psychological trauma.
The attacks were intended
as a warning of Judgement Day
if the Labour Party failed
to change its policies.
In court, the attacker stated
that he would do it again.
The 22 July Commission concluded that
the attack on the government quarter
could have been prevented,
that the authorities failed to protect
the people on Utoya
and that the emergency preparedness
should have been better.
The characters and story
in this film are fictional.
The film is based on detailed accounts,
as recorded by many of the survivors.
Right-wing extremism is increasing
in Europe and in the Western world.
The terrorist's concept of who
the enemy is lives on
and such views are on the rise.
