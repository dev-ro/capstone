Love you.
Thank you.
We did our encore,
so I guess tonight really is almost over.
Wait! Wait, please.
Do you remember something?
Of course.
The best part of the show...
ARMY BOMB wave!
Yeah, let's see
the most beautiful wave in the world.
Let's get it.
Everyone knows what to do.
Keep your ARMY BOMBS down,
then raise it up
when it's your turn, right?
As easy as pie.
Okay, today we'll start here.
Okay, we'll start here?
And... go all the way around.
- Okay, like a circle.
- All the way around, okay?
-Like a circle
-SUGA: Okay? Everyone good?
Please turn off the lights.
- Please turn the lights off.
- Turn off the lights.
Oh, yeah.
ARMY BOMB, hide!
ARMY BOMB...
Put your BOMBS down, please.
And raise it up when it's your turn, okay?
Go for it.
Okay, here we go, guys!
All right.
Three...
- Two, one.
- Two, one.
Let's go!
Wow, you guys are on fire today.
You guys are a lot better than this!
Let's move! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Slowly, it's too fast
- Move, move, move!
- Move faster!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!
Faster, faster, faster.
Go, go, go, go!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Well done, well done.
- Yeah, nice!
- Beautiful wave!
I think we could've done better.
The pace was a little off today.
- Okay, we got the... We did the rehearsal.
- Certainly...
One more?
- We can do better than yesterday
-So, one more time.
Basically, the floor,
you had to be slower because...
Oh, that's a rhyme there.
Floor, you need to be slower.
'Cause level two and level three...
There's a little delay.
So, okay? We go one more time
just the opposite.
Right over here
and then all the way around again.
I know you guys can do better.
Okay, here we go.
Turn the lights off, please, okay.
Okay, Jimin.
Start the countdown.
Are you ready?
Three... two...
One, let's go!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
Hurry, hurry!
Go, go, go!
- Yeah!
- Move, move, move!
Keep going! Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!
- Wave, wave, wave!
- So many people.
Okay, let's go. Go.
We're almost there. Almost there.
Oh, yeah.
What? What just happened?
Well done, well done.
Ten out of ten.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
With that, it's really time for us...
Beautiful.
What, JK?
What did you say?
It was so beautiful.
Yeah, that was beautiful.
On behalf of that, it's really time
for us to say goodbye for tonight.
Hobi?
Okay.
Hobi.
- I'm Hobi.
- Any remarks?
Okay, first, Hobi.
All right,
I'll be speaking in Korean today.
Of all four concerts,
this'll probably be the only one
where I'll speak in Korean.
Well...
In fact, ARMY from all over the world
flew all the way here
for our concert in LA.
I figured it's a very meaningful concert
for our fans too.
Yeah.
After two years of living with uncertainty
in times of the pandemic,
we're finally back doing a concert in LA.
And seeing this SoFi Stadium
filled with ARMY's shouts and cheers,
I think this concert is going to be...
a really big part of my own history,
as well as my memories.
It's going to be really meaningful for me.
For that reason, all of you ARMY
here today can be really proud.
This is a special concert for you.
This is a special concert for us.
All in all, this is a really special
and meaningful concert for everybody.
I really hope that
tonight was a highlight
for your own history,
your own life stories,
and your own memories.
I love you, I really love you. Thank you.
Today, I'm also...
I'm also going to speak in Korean.
Because I really want to show
how I feel in more detail.
My English is still not there yet,
so I'm going to try in Korean today.
I tried to get across how I felt yesterday
but I don't think I did a good job.
I wanted to tell you in person
that I really missed you,
and that I know how hard
things have been for you while waiting
and how thankful I am.
Who was that just now?
And yesterday...
I saw you guys for the first time
in two years.
I know I shouldn't feel that way
but it was a little awkward.
For the past two years in Korea,
we've been going on shows
and performing on stage
without the presence of fans.
We only performed in front of the cameras.
Now that you're here in front of us
after two years...
Seriously.
It kind of feels like we went back
about seven or eight years.
I realized yesterday that
I don't think I've been doing
all I could do for you guys
for the past two years.
But...
you've always been there waiting for us,
so I'm deeply honored and moved.
Thank you so much.
I think your emotions
really came through to me today.
I was very happy.
Thank you all so much for coming today.
I'll continue to work hard
and make you proud.
I always thank you and love you.
Love you, love you, love you
and I love you so much.
Love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you, love you, love you so much.
Love you.
You know what?
I got this new hat for just tonight.
Me too.
Beautiful.
Guys, so first things first.
I'd like to say sorry for my throat
for being born as my throat.
But congratulations to my throat
at the same time because
you can show your thing to these
50,000 beautiful people right now
here in LA at SoFi Stadium.
Yeah, you're so lucky.
Okay, so here's the story.
I just woke up this morning at like 9 a.m.
and I was like literally stuck in my bed.
I was like, "Oh, I can't do this."
My body was so out of order because
I was too nervous yesterday
and I used and wasted all of my energy.
And I was in bed thinking,
"I cannot do this tonight."
But you know, here's the magic.
You guys are the magic.
I always see you,
see your eyes face-to-face, and then...
Some power that I didn't even know
in my mind just pops up
and it moved my body and like...
♪ Eh-oh, bring it ♪
Like that, so...
You guys are the magic.
You guys are my miracles.
You guys are every word...
every good word in this world.
You guys...
I love you so much.
Yeah.
Another great night.
Hope you had a great time too.
Yeah. It's been so long and I was actually
really nervous performing
in front of all of you.
I'll be thinking about tonight a lot
when going home later.
This is such a precious memory
and I will cherish it forever.
So let's keep enjoying the show.
And...

We were just helping,

Okay.
So...
All right, guys.
Have a look around.
Isn't it like a movie?
I think you and I
are making a movie together.
To make this movie, I will do anything.
Regardless of how embarrassing
it might be, I will do my best
Just the thought of making

For me...
To be honest, for all seven of us,
this Permission to Dance On Stage concert
was a really big challenge.
You know, we're getting older.
And here's why we set this concert up
with no solo songs and just group songs.
Yes, please interpret it.
We've been away for two years
and we wanted your full attention
and your full focus on all seven of us.
So we prepared everything
from the cue sheets
the devices, the stage, and everything.
Preach.
Do you like that?
I had such a fun time today.
Thank you and I love you.
V!
Hey, guys, are you having fun?
Today...
I'm going to speak in Korean.
I had an amazing speech
prepared in English...
But it's a little hard
so I'm going to do it in Korean.
Seriously...
I really need to study English.
As soon as I go back to Korea
I'm going to study English.
Really?
Yeah, really.
First of all,
today is our second concert.
And we have two more concerts.
After that, we're going back to Korea.
Really...
When we're in Korea,
we'll probably continue to
shoot in front of the camera
record videos, and send those in.
It'll probably stay that way for a while.
But I don't need any of that.
I just want to come back here again.
Seriously...
Both yesterday and today, I really felt
your cheers, your passion, your eyes,
and everything else from ARMY.
And I'll be going back with all of them.
Okay, let's have another concert
in our dreams tonight.
Yeah.
I love you so much.
Oh, we love you. We purple you! Thank you.
Well done, well done, boys.
For our final song,
we will need everyone to join in together.
We have been waiting for this moment.
We've been longing for this moment.
Let's dance together.
And thank you for tonight.
