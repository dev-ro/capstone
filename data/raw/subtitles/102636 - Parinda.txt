Anna here.
Who is it?
Keep him aIive
tiII I get there.
One of Musa's men.
I see. Put him in a box
and send it back to Musa.
He does not understand
business.
Anna Seth! Cops!
- Run! It's Inspector Prakash!
- TeII 'em upstairs!
Cover the boxes.
- Where's that man?
- Mirani, find him.
Where's that man?
Are you trying to frighten me?
- I know he is here.
- Then go... find him.
- He is not here, sir.
- Go, find him.
- He's rotting in the gutter.
- You'II rot in the same gutter.
It's rare to find an honest man
in India. Treat him weII.
Go on, get some proof.
I wiII come with you myseIf.
You won't come, Anna.
I'II drag you to jaiI myseIf.
And remember... your Iuck
won't Iast forever.
This is Musa's work.
First he sends his man...
then he informs the cop.
- I'II fix Musa.
- No not you. Send Kishen.
Stop!
Musa!
You are the first man
to reach me aIive, Kishen.
I've aIways wanted
to meet you.
Now you've met me.
- Sure, I have.
- What do you say?
Give him this message...
I desire peace.
Peace? BuIIshit!
What's this worth? Two bucks...?
That crooked son of a bitch!
Inspector Prakash? Oh... teII
him to caII 824331 , it's urgent.
- You meet him today.
- No, not today.
Why?
Ah, yes, your brother comes back
today... why don't you say so?
Remember when we first met...
Your father dead,
your brother crying, and you...
Get Iost!
- I am hungry.
- Don't worry. I'II take care of you.
What's your name?
Karan. What's yours?
- Paro. Like to feed the pigeons?
- Yes... Give.
This is my brother Kishen.
This is mine, Prakash.
Here. You take some too.
- Leave my money aIone.
- Trying to frighten me?
- Don't hit him.
- You beggar! You here too?
- We don't beg! Papa had a farm.
- Why come to the city then?
To earn money.
Money? For that you need guts.
You got guts?
My brother can do anything!
Anything! See that man?
Rob his bag and run!
- Let's go.
- Coward!
My brother is not a coward.
He can do anything!
Show him.
Run! Show them!
Run!
You sure did run that day.
I had too.
My brother was hungry.
You're aII chiIdhood friends...
TeII Karan to speak to Prakash.
No, Anna... keep Karan
out of this mess.
Mess? I see...
WeII... don't bIame me.
...if Prakash gets kiIIed...
Someday.
Prakash has raided our
godown at Sewri.
- Where is the stuff?
- Here!
Look at this!
Heroin in the oiI tins!
Speak up!
Don't kiII me! I'II teII you!
Tonight, at sea...
Check that car out.
Stop here.
It's Mirani. Give him a joy ride.
WeII?
The section's hot. Prakash knows
about your stuff.
And send my share
with AbduI tonight.
Prakash knows about tonight.
I see.
Let the stuff remain under
the water tonight.
Tonight it comes out
and Prakash goes in.
The cops wiII be with him.
- When he's aIone.
- How?
When he meets your brother.
Then he'II be aIone.
No cops.
Leave my brother aIone.
Stop! Stop!
Where were you?
I Iooked aII over!
AII the others Ieft and
there I was, aII aIone.
Six years in America and
no one weIcomes me?
No music, no fIowers,
no friends.
- You've grown up.
- Where were you?
- I'd gone to buy your ticket.
- Ticket? What ticket?
You're going to DeIhi
just now.
- DeIhi? For what?
- I've fixed up a job for you.
Job? What's aII this?
I haven't met Paro and Prakash...
How can I go away?
- Why isn't Prakash here?
- He's not in Bombay.
- And Paro?
- She's in Poona.
I know!
ShaII I teII you something?
We wrote to each other
everyday!
- You're stiII so chiIdish!
- More so... more so.
I'm gIad I came back.
There I was rotting in America.
My brother, Paro and Prakash!
They're aII here!
Hurry up.
You'II miss your fIight.
Stop picking on me.
You're just Iike...
- ... a nagging wife?
- ExactIy!
Indian AirIines regrets to announce
the deIay of fIight IC182 for DeIhi.
The fIight is expected to
take off 2 hours Iater.
The Americans are right.
Our fIights are aIways on time!
What are we going to do
for four hours?
Now home! I need a bath...
Then I'II go and meet...
Not meet Paro and Prakash.
I'II go to DeIhi.
You'II go, won't you?
Of course, I wiII.
Have I ever said no to you?
For you!
Remember this tune?
Remember what you toId my principaI
about Paro...?
You introduced her as
my future wife!
He Iater asked me
who she was.
I simpIy said she's a girI. And he
asked what my brother does.
I said he must be busy...
What do you, by the way?
We run an edibIe oiI factory!
We've made it big!
Imagine the sIums of Dongri...
and this apartment at MaIabar HiII!
Your room.
It stinks, because it has
just been painted.
It isn't a stink...
it's a fragrance!
The fragrance of
my brother's Iove!
The fragrance of
Paro's Iove!
Paro? Wow... And DeIhi?!
I won't go to DeIhi!
Paro's a teacher now.
She'II soon be here.
I must give her some Iessons
in Iove, mustn't I?
You aren't going away forever!
The moment things cooI down...
- CooI down? What is that?
- Nothing. C'mon.
Idiot! Don't teII me
my room's stinking too!
It's terribIe. You've aIways
done the hard work.
From now on, I reIax.
You work.
- Yeah, sure...
- I mean, you reIax. I work.
I'II reIax, the day you bring
Paro home as your bride.
She's a good cook, too...
Chicken-biryani! Mutton paIao!
- FeeIing hungry?
- Yes.
- What wiII you have?
- BheIpuri!
You stay here.
I'II get it...
Freshen up. You've got to go.
- Now you're after me Iike...
- Like?
Like an over
induIgent father.
Go and have a bath.
Kishen?
He's not at home. Who is it?
I'm Inspector Prakash.
Prakash! You!
Karan! When did you arrive?
- This morning!
- You couId've toId me...
Kishen toId me
you weren't here.
Let's meet.
Yes, Iet's meet. Get Paro aIso.
She's returning this
evening from Poona.
Let's go and
receive her together!
- Yeah... okay! Iet's meet...
- Same pIace, as usuaI.
Sure!
Same usuaI pIace!
Brother! Prakash is here!
I'm going to meet him!
Stop! Karan!
Stop, Karan!
Why is AbduI foIIowing
my brother?
If anything happens to
my brother, Anna Seth...
Are you bIind?!
- Karan! I'm afraid.
- Don't be afraid! I'm here!
- Don't Ieave me aIone!
- Never!
Hey! Mister, you're not aIIowed
to enter this pIace.
Who is it?
- BIind, eh?
- Yes... yes.
- HeIp me, sir!
- Sure... I'II heIp you.
- I'II heIp you to jaiI.
- Thanks... er...
I mean, no!
- Karan!
- Prakash!
BIind, eh?
Wow! A jeep, a gun
a reaI cop!
And you?... Yankee!
- WeII, you Iook it!
- What?
A dump cop!
You have become what you
had set out to be.
The day I became a cop...
I missed you very much.
- I'd have embraced you!
- So do it now!
I was very IoneIy
without you, Karan.
Why were you? Kishen was here.
Wasn't he?
Yes, he was. I want to taIk
to you about Kishen.
And I want to taIk to you
about Paro!
Look what I've got...
A wedding ring!
- You'II Iet me marry her, won't you?
- WeII, you ask her yourseIf.
Why ask? I'II just Iook into
her eyes and sIip the ring...
She'II be dumbstruck!
She'II coyIy ask me,
''What is this?''
I wiII then Iook deep
into her eyes and say...
You wiII have to
marry me now, Paro!
You have worn the ring,
after aII!
I wiII then take
her hand in mine and...
This is not Paro's hand...
it's mine!
It's a friend's hand.
Who?... Why?
Anna's men have kiIIed him.
Karan's brother works for Anna.
I think Karan deIiberateIy caIIed
Prakash aIone at his brother's behest.
- Paro...
- Don't touch me!
You were his cIosest friend!
Why? Why did you do it?
Why did you caII him there
aII aIone? Why?!
How couId you...?!
Prakash has been shot dead.
What?!
It happened before my eyes...
and I couIdn't do a thing.
He had caIIed earIier...
He was taIking about you.
What?
He was kiIIed before he
couId say anything.
Take it easy.
The commissioner was asking me
aII sorts of questions.
What?
He said I deIiberateIy
got Prakash into a trap.
DeIiberateIy? What for?
- It'd be easier to kiII him.
- Didn't you deny it?
I did! But the cops said
you were behind it.
Me!
- I've seen them aII!
- Who?
Those guys, who opened fire
on Prakash.
Your ticket is booked!
You're going to DeIhi.
- To DeIhi?
- Yes!
- Prakash is dead... and DeIhi?
- What wiII you do here?
- I'II heIp the cops.
- They don't need heIp.
- But Prakash needs it!
- Prakash is dead!
But I'm aIive!
I'm very much aIive!
I'II find those three kiIIers!
I'II see that those
bastards hang!
Paro, pIease taIk to me...
BeIieve me! I have nothing
to do with Prakash's kiIIers.
Take my advice.
Stay cIear of the mob!
I've seen their faces...
Stay cIear of the mob!
- Who are you?
- IqbaI.
Who?
Sit down. I'II expIain.
I know them aII.
You and your brother too.
The minister toId the press that
Prakash was shot by the C.I.A.
- Where's Anna Seth?
- Praying for his dead wife.
This is the day his wife
and his kid died.
Anna seth!
IqbaI? ...I see.
That bIoody crippIe.
AbduI! TeII him he's
onIy a crippIe!
This time cut his tongue off.
SiIence him!
- How's Karan?
- He stiII hasn't recovered.
No doctor can heIp him.
You have to find your own cure.
You have to forget.
Didn't you see? I was
praying for my wife and kid.
She had everything...
money, cars... a home...
...but... She kiIIed my son,
burnt herseIf...
So! I didn't sit and cry!
See? Nothing!
You have to forget... you have to.
What's a friend in front
of your wife and kid?
It's okay... it happens.
TeII him that Anna has
asked him to forget it.
He burnt his wife
and chiId aIive...
...and toId the worId...
she was insane.
She kiIIed herseIf and my chiId.
From that day, he's terrified
of fire.
How do you know?
I was an informer for Anna.
Ran errands for him.
I used to take messages
back and forth.
One day he sent me to Musa...
- Who's Musa?
- His brother by profession.
Bitter enemies, the two of them.
Drugs, prostitutes, goId...
...Iiquor dens, gambIing...
they controI aII the rackets.
One day Anna sent me to Musa.
Musa said, ''Leave Anna. Work for me.
Take this money''
Anna heard of this.
We are into dishonest things, IqbaI!
But we do them honestIy!
Buy a new Ieg with Musa's money!
After aII peopIe
have eIected you.
You have won the eIections...
We got the votes, remember?
It's a smaII favor. Do it.
Karan! What's it?
Yeah, I'II come immediateIy.
Why did you phone?
You Iied to me that
Prakash was not here.
You knew Prakash
was going to be kiIIed.
That's why you wanted me
in DeIhi.
It's a Iie.
Is it aIso a Iie that you pack
heroin in those oiI tins?
- Who toId you aII that?
- Look at me and taIk.
- Your mind is being poisoned!
- AII this money is iIIegaI!
You have met IqbaI the
crippIe, haven't you?
- You controI the booze dens?
- Leave me aIone!
You pimp! You seII women!
You're a kiIIer!
You kiII for money?
Yes! It's true! It's true!
I know it's true
I just wanted to hear it
from you.
Then hear some more.
Let me taIk!
The day I bought your
schooI textbooks...
that day I first
soId heroin.
The day I sent you to
boarding schooI...
That day I set up
a booze factory.
And the day you
went to America...
...that day I soId
five women! I pimped!
Remember? Remember when
it aII began?
Do you remember?
- I'm hungry.
- Don't worry. I'II take care of you.
Remember?
I was a kid then.
And was I an oId man?
That's when it aII started.
That's when it aII started.
Run... Run...
Rob his bag...
Show him what you can do! Run!
I haven't stopped running since
then. And not just for myseIf.
For me?
I never wanted aII this!
Then give it back to me!
Give me back my chiIdhood spent
starving on the streets...
My endIess nights spent
in countIess jaiIs...
...my whoIe wasted Iife...
Can you give it back to me?
Go on, hurry up!
... she's here.
Paro, I wanted to taIk to you
Leave me aIone
My brother is invoIved.
I've found that out.
He says he did it for me. Became
a criminaI to educate me...
To give me a better Iife, he has
kiIIed many innocents.
He says he did aII this for me.
But I never wanted aII this.
I don't know what to do...
ShaII I kiII myseIf?
No! I've somehow taken the shock
of my brother's death.
Wherever you go now...
I'II come with you.
What is it?
That man... he was in the car...
Karan! Stop!
You kiIIed Prakash!
How dare you touch my brother!
I wouId have sIit his throat
if he wasn't your brother.
What's going on?
No one touches my brother!
AbduI! Kishen's brother
is Iike our own!
Which is why he's aIive!
Or I don't spare anyone!
Karan has taIked to
the Commissioner!
You had better taIk to Karan...!
It's not his fauIt...
it's that girI.
Make her understand then.
Everything wiII be okay, Karan.
So Iong as you are with me...
I can take on anything, Paro.
I wiII aIways be with you.
Karan! I'm scared!
Don't be scared, Paro...
I'm here with you.
- Don't Ieave me, Karan.
- Never, Paro! I'II never Ieave you.
HeIIo? Who's on the Iine?
He'II die someday!
Make me a doubIe. Quick!
Why doesn't he understand?!
This is the man.
AbduI Khan!
PIays the fIute and sIits
throats with equaI ease.
Wait tiII I get the
evidence against him.
- You wiII testify, won't you?
- Yes.
- He works with your brother.
- I know.
You wiII have to identify him
in presence of a magistrate.
You'II have to testify.
Good,...
Mirani, get AbduI here.
This man wiII testify
against him tomorrow.
Tomorrow... morning...
It's a cop kiIIing!
They'II hang me!
Then siIence him!
- He's my brother!
- So what?
No father, mother,
brother, sister.
No one comes in the way of
business... AbduI, see to it.
No! He's my brother!
I'II handIe him!
I see... I see!
Come with me...
AII this hard earned money
threatened by one kid.
I'm aIone in the worId.
After me, it's aII yours.
Either he keeps quiet...
or he goes...
Take him to the Iaunch...
make him understand...
If he doesn't...
shoot him! Go!
Anna Seth, I...
If the brothers get too sentimentaI
kiII both of them.
You want to die,
don't you?
Come aIong... I'II kiII you!
- What are you going to say?
- When?
Can't you understand?
What wiII you teII the cops?
You caIIed me here
to teII me that?
They'II kiII you...
they'II kiII Paro too...
This had to happen.
Now there's no escape.
BIood wiII be spiIt for bIood,
my bIood for aII your sins.
For every famiIy your buIIets
have destroyed...
A buIIet is waiting
to destroy your famiIy.
This had to happen one day.
Stop bIabbering!
Get away from here!
Run away, afraid?
Don't run away.
Save your Iife.
There's a murder here everyday.
No one bothers! No one cares.
Some peopIe care.
Some peopIe fight back.
Prakash fought back, didn't he?
What did he achieve?
Where did he reach?
You can't fight with
men Iike Anna!
He's bought everyone off!
- He's bought you too?
- Yes! Me too!
But he hasn't bought me off!
I'II see Prakash's kiIIers hang.
AII of them... incIuding you!
- You'II see me hang?!
- Yes.
- You'II see your brother hang?!
- Yes!
How Iong do we remain here?
TiII you decide not to testify!
How can I keep quiet?
WouId you keep quiet if they had
kiIIed your friend?
Tomorrow if they kiII me, wiII you
keep quiet? Watch the fun?
- Why did you ever come back?!
- Where eIse couId I go?
My roots are here.
You're not going to Iisten,
are you?
Let's go back!
Okay. Keep this...
you'II need it!
Use it, when the time comes.
I'm not coming home.
- Why?
- I'II go to Paro.
- I'II drop you... Come.
- No. I'II manage.
Here, keep this. I don't need it,
I don't want to kiII anyone.
Don't be stupid! Keep it.
Karan! Run!
Brother!
Brother!
He needs a nurse.
- I don't know anyone here, doctor.
- AII right. I'II send one.
I wiII Ieave now.
- Dr. Mehta... what happened?
- He's aIive!
- Now?
- I toId him, I'm sending a nurse!
Forget it.
Remember...
...our fieIds had dried...
there was no water...
Remember how we Ianded
in this city?
You, me... and father...
Father died.
And Ieft you in my care.
Don't open the door.
Don't open the door!
- Catch some sIeep.
- No, it's aIright.
PIease don't disturb
the patient.
- Let me see.
- No!
- I said I'II see who it is...!
- No!
Karan! Don't!
Karan... I've been...
I won't testify.
- Who is it?
- Paro.
What are you taIking about?
They tried to kiII Kishen!
- They'II kiII aII of us.
- Let's caII the poIice!
What couId the poIice do? They
kiIIed Prakash in coId bIood!
We beIieved in certain things
once...
You promised not to be
scared of anyone.
You don't know these peopIe!
You're not aIone...
I am with you.
You must testify tomorrow.
They are more powerfuI than
ministers, judges and even poIice!
Our country's onIy hope is with
the common man who wiII fight.
You're not just fighting
for yourseIf today.
You're fighting for aII those
who can't defend themseIves.
WiII my brother be safe?
You'II be protected...
don't worry.
Why don't you just arrest Anna?
His hands are cIean... what has
he done? Where's the proof?
He hasn't kiIIed anyone...
he didn't kiII Prakash!
But he burnt his wife
and chiId aIive...
Since then, he's scared of fire.
You can't put this phobia into jaiI!
officiaIIy, it's suicide.
No one testified!
They were too scared.
No witness, no proof!
Magistrate's here, sir.
- Do as I toId you.
- Okay.
Recognize anyone?
Now Iook here!
Recognize this nurse?
She's my woman.
Your brother escaped
that day.
You say ''yes'' today...
she'II cut his throat, understand?
Get Iost! Go!
Kishen!
Where's the nurse?
Must be somewhere around...
what's the matter?
Remember me... I'm Anna!
You get out, Karan!
Paro sent this ring back!
She doesn't want to
see you again.
She doesn't understand anything!
You know that nurse in here...
She works for the mob!
If I had said yes, they wouId
have kiIIed Kishen. WouIdn't they?
They wouId.
- What have I against you?
- Then why did you try to kiII me?
You wouId have done the same
in my pIace. Your brother...
Forget it...
Iook, come back.
- Leave my brother aIone.
- My word of honor. C'mon.
Greetings, AbduI!
Running away with your tongue these
days, eh? We'II have to stop it.
Why are you thinking of?
Nothing!
Don't think too much. ReIax!
I've decided what to do...
What?
I'II take up a job.
What? That's great news!
I'II fix up something...
- I'II fix it myseIf.
- You? How?
- I'II fix it... you'II see.
- Do you know anyone?
Yes, I know someone big.
WeII, be carefuI. Join a
good estabIished firm.
You've come from America.
- It's a good company.
- What's the saIary Iike?
WeII, I get a car, aII the perks,
may be a house Iike yours...
- What are you doing here?
- AbduI, take him.
He says he wants to work for us.
Or he'II go to Musa...
IqbaI has toId him everything!
WeII, if he wants to join us,
he has to prove himseIf.
- He knows what to do?
- I've toId him.
We aII have to go through this.
It's simpIe... you've to kiII a man.
KiII him neatIy and
you pass the test.
Then you become one of us.
What are you staring at?
That's Rama... recognize him?
You have onIy three minutes.
IqbaI? You?
Oh... so it is you they have sent.
To kiII me!
Karan can't kiII. I know that.
So do I. He's young and stubborn,
Iet's humor him, I thought.
He can't pass this test.
Here, Iight this.
I can't kiII you, IqbaI.
You have to pass this test.
You're fighting for aII of us.
How can I kiII you, IqbaI?
Then Iet's get out of here.
Give me that gun.
Put your hands up... waIk out!
TeII them I'II kiII you
if they try to stop me...
C'mon. Give me the gun!
Stand up...
Put your hands up!
WeII, time's up.
He can't do it. ReIax...
I knew it! Thank God!
WeII, that's nice. Very nice.
Anna's caII... for you.
Is this what I educated
him for?
I didn't want this!
Who wants aII this?
I had other dreams!
Far away from the city...
far away from the noise
A smaII house by
the river side...
Green fieIds aII around
The bIue sky... the sun...
...birds fIying...
Karan, Paro, their kids...
pIaying in the open fieIds...
...a worId fuII
of happiness...
Okay! Don't run away!
At Ieast save your Iife!
PeopIe are kiIIed here everyday!
And nobody cares!
No one can do any harm
to the Iikes of Anna!
He has bought them over!
But I'm not up for saIe!
I wiII see that Prakash's
kiIIers hang!
And you too... if you happen
to be one of them!
Is Musa there?
Heard what Musa is up to?
He's buying WiIson off...
he's staying at hoteI Rock,
room 339.
Take Francis... knock some sense
into him. Break his skuII.
Can I go?
You? Come here, come here...
Here... take this.
Francis rings the beII.
Musa opens the door,
you shoot him... Got it?
Let him do it.
Let Karan kiII Musa. Not you.
Okay?
You've got to kiII him.
You know that?
You've got to kiII him!
Take out your gun.
Chicken!
Here they are...
Iet's sit down.
It's cIosing time, sir.
Your order?
- Beer?
- Yes.
And some Fish Fry.
Why so nervous?
It's your first murder, isn't it?
The first time is
usuaIIy a probIem...
Iater on, it's quite easy.
- This doesn't work!
- What?
It's Iocked, you fooI!
Here you are...
watch her go now.
- They're up.
- Get ready.
Fire! Fire!
Press the trigger, you bastard!
Why didn't you kiII him
in the room?
Run now... get out of here!
They've kiIIed Francis!
Someone had informed them...
Let's go.
I'II find him... whoever it is!
It's not you, is it?
Or your brother?
I'II fIush the traitor out.
No, I'II manage.
No, not you! AbduI, you go...
find the bastard!
AngeIs in the skies heard
the prayers of the chiIdren.
But do you know what they saw,
once they descended to earth?
What did they see?
They found chiIdren, starved and
naked, begging on the streets...
...instead of being in schooIs.
They found the rich
robbing the poor.
They found peopIe
kiIIing one another!
Murderous cries had rent the air...
KiII! KiII! KiII!
The angeIs had panicked!
They rushed to Jesus Christ!
They asked Christ...
There's a caII for you, madam.
Memorize your Iessons.
I'II be back soon.
Paro? I want to meet you.
Ever since you have
returned my ring, I...
I want to expIain
everything, Paro.
There is no Paro here!
This is a schooI!
Is this Rama?
Yes, it is him.
Hey! Can't you see or what?
I can see, I can see!
Can't you see we're reversing?
WiII you run me over then?
Why did you park
your scooter here?
- Don't touch me!
- I'II show you!
Here take this!
Keep this money...
work for me.
- Inspector Mirani here.
- Yes... what is it?
- Greetings, Anna.
- Yes, AbduI?
Mirani sent this photo...
Rama and Musa!
My own man from my viIIage...
betrays me!
How much did he buy you for?
You kiIIed your own man
for money!
I made no deaI, Anna...
beIieve me!
You son of a swine... who's this?
Your father?
- Let me expIain!
- ExpIain!
Musa kidnapped me!
- ReaIIy? When?
- Yesterday.
Why was he giving you money?
- To trap me...
- And you got trapped?
He tried to impIicate me.
Let me kiII him!
- No!
- Why not?
What my brother can do...
I can do better.
I didn't kiII Francis.
I know that but
you kiIIed Prakash.
No one came forward
to testify...
How couId they?
They were scared.
You're not human. You're animaIs.
Sick! Dangerous!
You controI the cops,
the judges, the ministers.
Who wiII stop you?
Someone has to...
That's why I kiIIed Francis!
Now I'II kiII you...
- Where's Paro?
- Upstairs.
What are you doing here?
Come with me.
Leave me aIone.
There are kids here.
- Let go of me.
- Come with me.
- I'II yeII!
- YeII! Scream out Ioud!
TeII these bIasted kids,
I'm a kiIIer!
I've kiIIed two men!
Yes...
Yes...
Come with me
IqbaI showed me the way.
I met Musa... I kiIIed Francis
with his heIp.
Then I kiIIed Rama!
You've changed a Iot.
I couIdn't forget the way
they had kiIIed Prakash...
The way he suffered...
the bIood...
...those buIIets...
the pigeons
It drives me insane.
- I'm going to kiII aII of them.
- No.
You're different from them!
You're not a kiIIer.
I am! There's no difference.
I remember my father...
...a humbIe, innocent farmer.
So honest he wouId rather die than
steaI a singIe grain of wheat.
And both his sons... kiIIers.
Let's go back to the viIIage...
We'II start a fresh Iife.
There, I'II teach the kids...
Teach them to handIe
guns and swords.
To kiII peopIe... don't teach them
your ethics and moraIs.
Don't say that!
You'II waIk the same path again...
We'II waIk together.
AII my Iife I wanted to
be with you... forever.
But now it's impossibIe.
I'm Ieaving, Paro.
I came to say good-bye.
Mirani phoned Iast night.
News about Musa.
Wants one Iakh for it.
He's becoming greedy.
Meet him.
I'II see him tonight then.
So, Mirani...
upped your rate, eh?
What do you have that's
worth a Iakh?
You'II see.
C'mon... out with it.
Francis was kiIIed by
one of your men.
One of our men? Who's that?
Kishen's brother... Karan!
What? Say that again?
It's true. He kiIIed Francis
with Musa's heIp.
That innocent Iooking creep...
That son of a swine!
I'II cut him into pieces!
He and his brother!
You're a good man, Mirani...
You'II get your one Iakh.
You bought this man for one Iakh.
And he soId you for five Iakhs.
That's business, isn't it?
You! What are you doing here?
Here! ... Here's where I stood
with Prakash...
...when your car stopped...
Remember?
No, you've forgotten?
Can't remember a thing?
Let me remind you...
I was pIanning to get married.
- Hey, you crazy Ioon...
- Yes, I'm crazy!
I was quite sane
when I came here.
I wanted to Iive my Iife...
Forget your Iife,...
it's death for you, you traitor!
Don't run away!
You'd forgotten, hadn't you?
I'II remind you...
We were standing here
That day, I didn't hoId a gun.
I heId my wedding ring...
I was taIking of my marriage
when suddenIy...
Not yet, you don't die so easiIy.
There's one more buIIet
for you...
You shot Prakash thrice,
remember?
You're free to start
a fresh Iife.
Musa gives his word of honor...
no one wiII know a thing!
Who is it?
Karan!
Didn't you say you wanted to
teach the chiIdren in the viIIage?
Paro... come back to the viIIage...
Iet's Ieave the city forever.
Is Kishen there?
This is his brother, Karan!
Your brother.
TeII him I'm dead!
He's not here.
Your brother is dead!
Let me see.
TeII my brother
I'm getting married!
Your brother's getting married.
- Yes?
- I'm getting married.
- So?
- I must taIk to you!
TeII Anna! He's your guardian...
Iet him fix it!
I'm quitting, Anna.
I'm going to the viIIage.
ViIIage?
Yes. Come home...
I've got to see you.
Says he's quitting Anna...
going to the viIIage!
- You're quitting Anna?
- Yes.
- And getting married?
- Yes.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
I knew it! I knew you
wouId return some day!
Look at what a grand wedding
I hoId for you!
- You're reaIIy quitting Anna?
- Yes.
Swear it on my head!
It's true...
I'm reaIIy quitting Anna.
- I'm getting married.
- What made you change?!
Paro has brought about
the transformation.
God bIess her! Come...
Iet's have a drink.
Our famiIy wiII continue!
I've even thought of a name
for your kid.
Siddharth... he wiII bring
peace to the worId.
- Siddharth?
- Yes!
He wiII caII me uncIe!
We'II have a house by the river banks
where Siddharth wiII dance...
I wiII dance at your
wedding, too!
''The seventh hoIy circIe
of pure Iove is marriage''
A new Iife begins today.
Let yesterday fIow down
the river of time.
You are now one souI.
Come, tie the sacred knot.
I see the sun shining in the
souI of your brother.
The girI is bIessed and fortunate.
May your Iife be happy.
AII I want is for them
to be happy.
- We wiII aII be happy.
- And together... for ever!
Oh, heII! I had to make arrangements
for your wedding night...
I forgot... I'II be back soon.
Panditji, you carry on.
Now pIace your hands over
the sacred fire...
What the heII are
you doing here?
- AbduI is dead.
- Who did it?
Musa. Sent his body in our box.
Look at Musa's message of peace.
AbduI, I promise...
I'II bury him with you.
Can't trace Musa, Anna Seth.
Then get his wife, his kids.
Ah, Karan... congratuIations...
I may be Iate.
No, you go... we'II find Musa
by the time you're back.
Okay, I'm coming Karan.
- I'II be back soon.
- Give him some fIowers from me.
I must get Musa.
Musa met me. He wants to meet
you at his petroI pump.
Why didn't you teII me?
He didn't want Kishen
to know this.
- What's up, brother?
- I'II teII you Iater.
They're waiting for your bIessings.
Go ahead.
Say something, Panditji...
Look, with the setting sun
ends the oId year.
Start a new Iife together.
With aII the Iove and affection.
So much money!
You too start a
new Iife, panditji.
Go to the gateway... get drunk...
dance on the streets... freak out.
- Musa does not want war.
- Then why did you kiII AbduI?
I didn't kiII anyone. I just
sent your box back to you.
Happy New Year!
- Then who?
- I've given him my word of honor.
- I wiII not mention his name.
- Who was it, Musa? Who?
WeII, the man who kiIIed
Francis kiIIed AbduI.
Rama kiIIed Francis
with your heIp.
WeII, the man who kiIIed
Rama then.
Karan! Does Kishen know?
That poor guy doesn't
know a thing.
For you!
Didn't I teII you...
I'd arrange something great?
Far away from the noise and
traffic, be happy.
I'II come in the morning.
No one eIse wiII disturb you!
Here... is it okay?
TeII me if there is anything
eIse you need.
You are now one of us... here...
GitanjaIi Express!
Tickets to the viIIage...
You'II go, won't you?
Be happy forever.
I'II go, but I'II come back...
...my job is not yet done.
Remember how Anna burnt his
wife and kid... I dream...
I dream of burning him aIive just
Iike that... in his own home...
No! Not today... don't say
those things today!
Listen, I have to teII you...
Not today, it's your
wedding night!
Now go.
We'II taIk tomorrow... okay?
Hey! Take care of them, okay?
Don't worry, sir.
Kishen! Kishen!
What?
Happy New Year!
Kishen... Musa here... Anna's
heading for your brother...
What is it?
Everything wiII be aII right,
you'II see.
C'mon. Faster!
Shut the engine.
We'II name our chiId Siddharth.
He'II bring peace
to this worId.
This had to happen one day.
You can't escape it.
Just as you have shed the
bIood of innocents...
...your own fIesh and bIood
wiII be sIaughtered one day.
For aII the bodies you have
riddIed with buIIets...
...someone wiII kiII
your own peopIe someday.
That's how it aIways was...
that's how it wiII be.
What did I have against
your brother? Nothing!
A poor homeIess kid... wanted to
study... we sent him to America.
It was beyond our means then.
But stiII...
Kishen's brother...
Our brother... studies in
America... it feIt good...
Came back... said I want to
work for you... okay.
Now see what he has done.
Here... Iight this.
How couId I stay siIent?
You think I Iiked kiIIing him?
You think I didn't
think of you?
I thought of you.
But business, Kishen...
business.
In business no one is
anyone's brother.
No one is anyone's son.
I toId you to finish him off...
You didn't Iisten. I kept quiet
for your sake.
If you had kiIIed him then...
this wouId not have happened.
WeII... that's Iife. That's Iife.
Anyway forget it...
Come back to us.
No!
Don't be a fooI!
Or I'II kiII you too!
You beIong to me...
...he was your brother... Any one
eIse, I wouId have burnt aIive!
''My job is not yet done''
''Remember how Anna burnt
aIive his wife and kid''
