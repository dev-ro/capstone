NETFLIX PRESENTS
Tonight the world will witness a rare celestial event
with the first total lunar eclipse, a full moon night.
People will be able to observe the total lunar eclipse
in the Mediterranean sky
and in parts of West Asia and North Africa.
This is a rare event that will only happen again in 19 years.
- Decrease. - This lunar eclipse is…
Yes. The dosage depends on the weight of the dog.
Give him the whole stamp. Mix it with his food.
Good. Half a tablet, then.
Follow the dosage on the box.
How much does he weigh ?
Okay. Give him three quarters, just to be on the safe side.
Yes.
Stopped.
No, not you, ma'am. It is my dog.
Dobermann. He is fierce.
No ! Sit down, Zeezo!
Good dog.
Three quarters stamp, for security. Yes Madam.
- Where are you going ? - I told you. At Tina's.
Don't lie to me, Sophie.
Okay, don't believe me.
- Who's picking you up? - Tina and friends you don't know.
Are you going to see this Jalal, Jeelo, whatever his name is?
Non.
Do not lie to me.
I'm going to Tina's and I don't know who will be there.
And what is that?
It was in your bag.
It's up to Tina. I hide them for her.
Tina.
Do you take me for a bitch?
Do you sleep with him?
I'll tell your dad. You drive Me crazy.
You're the one driving yourself crazy.
Mom, Emad has had dinner.
If he says he's hungry, that's an excuse to stay up late.
Mulukhia is served hot.
Yes, I covered it.
It's still hot, but it's going to curdle.
I hope not.
Sarah! Emad! Did you see the time?
Switch off and go to bed.
- Five minutes. - Mum.
Not five minutes, Sara.
Go on ! Emad, turn it off or I'll tickle you.
These things will fry their brains.
Come on, kids! Let's go.
It's the sugar your mother gives them that will burn their brains.
I bring the rice and the meat.
Attends.
I stopped the pill.
What ?
I found this in your daughter's bag.
- Did you search his bag? - I was looking for papers.
Really, May?
She's going out with this Jeelo, her stupid boyfriend.
Did you search his bag?
Yes. Is that all you care about?
Your daughter is out of control.
Tell him not to come out.
May, she's turning 18. She will do what she wants.
Why are you so weak with her?
I can't wait to see May's face when she sees I have her bunnies.
I don't have my phone. A second.
Let's go ?
How many young people do you see at the clinic?
You can't control this. You know.
- It's my daughter. - You argue constantly.
She thinks she can do whatever she wants.
She's big enough. She's no longer a child, May.
My mother didn't worry about me.
I am not your mother!
I never worried her.
You are a guy. It's different.
What are you talking about ?
Go on !
If it was a boy, would condoms be okay?
Are you the cool parent now?
Focus on your onions.
What is this shitty wine?
It sucks. Do we take another?
Bad ?
It's a $40 bottle of wine.
Come on Ziad. You know how they are.
- What do you do ? No. - I take off the price.
It's inappropriate, Ziad.
Leave it, let them know how much it costs.
Why is this solar eclipse so special?
The moon will be dark for a while.
But this is the true face of the moon.
- This is a good thing ? - No, it's weird.
Strange things are happening.
By the way, it's lunar, not solar.
Okay.
No worries, really.
Oh, my eclipse!
Welcome !
- Welcome ! - Will!
- How are you ? - What a pleasure !
- I missed you. - Me too.
- Should not. What's this ? - Mulukhia.
We are going to taste the Egyptian mulukhia .
Not just any, it's rabbit.
To learn how to do it, you have to say "lanip".
- Lanip. - With a wink.
- Salvation. - Mayousha!
- How are you ? - I missed you.
Me too. Are you talking about rabbits?
We brought mulukhia to the rabbit.
- For culture shock. - What a shock ?
It took place at the El Prince restaurant in Egypt.
- Well done ! Do you still remember? - How to forget ?
Doesn't it smell too strong?
You make us hungry.
- She doesn't stop. - Brilliant !
- What are you drinking ? - Because you cook.
Nothing. Where is Sophie?
She dresses. She goes out.
- Okay. I'll… - Avoid.
Why did you do it ? I want…
- What is it ? - I found in his bag…
- Cigarettes ? - A condom.
Damn it ! And his father found out.
- And did nothing? - No.
Don't let her out.
- Good evening. - Salvation.
- Good evening. - Salvation.
- Hi, Jane. - How are you ?
- Hi, Sheriff. - How are you ?
- I missed you. - Me too.
- Pretty dress. - It fits you well.
- Thank you. - Hello, May.
- Hi, Mariam. - How are you ?
You look beautiful !
Thank you darling.
- Hello, May. - Two kisses.
- I'm parked behind you. - No scratches?
Just a little.
- Is the new couple here? - No.
- Just a bottle? - You want a whole crate?
- It's a $40 bottle. - Really, Ziad?
I know, I saw the price.
- Organic. - Organic ? It sucks. It doesn't open.
Rabih brings his girlfriend. What is her name ?
Rasha.
She must be cute.
She must be special.
What's wrong with him?
He's the kind of man women love.
Rabih is funny.
In 25 years, I've never seen him with a good girl.
- Scum. - Oh ! You are jealous ?
What's wrong with him?
He is cute, funny, he has a good heart. People love it.
It makes him a great friend, that's all.
Why are you mean?
All the ones you've dated are beauties?
I didn't mean that, Jana. Corn…
They are there.
I can not wait to see her.
You think she's hot and they'll be jealous? What ?
I always miss the exit.
What ?
You are alone. Where is Rasha?
- We were expecting him. - Yes.
I know, but she wasn't feeling well, we preferred that she rest...
It's serious ?
Nothing serious. She's not the best, but that's okay.
Pity ! We wanted to meet her.
- Yes. - The dinner is in his honor.
- I am leaving ? - No !
Come on, Beebo! We didn't think so.
- Give me that. - Dear !
- I missed you ! - Me too !
How are you ?
- Welcome. - Already dumped?
- Go on ! - She dumped you?
No ! She does not feel well.
- A fight. - No.
- What does she have ? - She is sick.
- Fever ? - No.
- Beebo! How are you ? - What's wrong with him?
- No argument? - No.
What's up mate ?
- Forget it, he's boring. - What's wrong with him?
- How old is she, did you say? - I said nothing.
- OKAY. - Stop.
Leave it.
Do not listen to them.
- What's this ? - For Rabih.
They want to know his age. She is old?
- What do you mean, old lady? - We don't know her.
Is she big, small?
- Pretty ? - Yes.
- Ignore them. - Why ?
We want to know.
Tell me. Forget them.
And his Instagram?
- She does not have any. - What ?
Neither Instagram nor Facebook.
Do you have a photo?
- No. - Go on.
- It's the solar eclipse. - Lunar.
Now ? Yes. It started. Go on.
- It's a lunar eclipse. - Shall we have dinner? This way.
I'm hungry.
- I see two. - There are two.
You should see four.
You have to focus.
- Like that ? - Yes.
Don't shake it.
- Do you see her ? - Yes.
- Too handsome. - Come on, get moving.
- Warning. It's delicate. - Clear !
- So ? - Brilliant !
He's an astrologer now!
- Do you see something ? - Magnificent.
- Show me. - Go ahead.
Do you see two of them, one on top of the other?
- Don't move it. - I didn't know he was moving on his own.
Look and calibrate it in your view.
- So ? Rasha? - Yes.
Tell me. How are you feeling ?
How are you. You know how it is, at first.
It's good.
- What are you talking about? - She's asking me questions.
We're talking about his girlfriend. He hides it.
They are dying to know more about her.
- And not you ? - Yes.
- But not like this. - That is to say ?
The investigation is over.
They tell him about Rasha.
I know why she's not here. He doesn't want to be seen in love.
- Lover ? - Yes. Love!
I don't know if I like it.
What do you mean ?
How do we know if we are in love? How do we know?
I forgot, honestly.
If you want to talk to her more than 20 times a day, you're in love.
- What if it's 40? - Forty…
Forty, then you're screwed!
Stop talking, you're married.
Do not laugh. It's a bad joke.
- How long have you been together? - A little over a month.
- You still have a crush. - It's new, it's normal.
Come on, tell me.
What are these questions?
Tell us everything. Is it banal or is it love?
Is it good or not?
A real interrogation.
What ? We just want to know.
Okay. What ?
- She's fine ? - What do you mean, Ziad?
You and your questions!
- It reminds me of our first meeting. - When ? I forgot.
- Not me. - I was terrified.
No, what would I say?
New marriage, new country, people I didn't know.
I knew you spoke Arabic and all, but a little slang...
Look at you. A real magpie!
Stop, I'm going to make a complex!
- It's bad ? - You call me a chatterbox.
She speaks a lot.
Once at the supermarket, she almost got into a fight.
She said, "Son of..." And I explained to her...
There is another expression that I forgot.
Oi. Bokra a bokra.
- It means "tomorrow morning". - Then say that.
I was scared.
You are Ziad's childhood friends. I imagined you withdrawn.
Fear ? From U.S ?
- We're angels. - Look at their wings.
That day, I changed my outfit ten times.
Twenty times.
- Have you found something to wear? - No, but I was so comfortable with you.
Like I was family.
Or not ?
Of course, my pretty!
Yes of course.
What would you do without Janjoun?
Are you going to let her go?
You have it all day. It's my turn.
- Come on, I'm hungry. - Not me.
- I'm hungry ! - Come in.
- Go on. - Calibrate it up.
- You ruined everything. - How are you. Calibrate it.
Listen to the professor.
- Put your eye there. - Like that ?
Let me calibrate. You see ?
Honestly, don't blame me for everything.
It's the first time we've seen each other without Simi and Nour.
She says hello to you.
- She is fine ? - Devastated. She is with her mother.
Normal. Her husband is having an affair with a girl their daughter's age.
It's dangerous.
How will she overcome this?
- You knew it ? - What ?
- For age? - No.
Non.
Do you believe them?
- They tell each other everything. - Are you worried about them?
How to know ? Do you think he'll tell us?
Come on, Mariam.
- Looks like it if we knew? - You should.
- What are friends for? - What ?
Even if we knew.
We would go see Nour to say that Simi is cheating on her
with a 23 year old girl?
Twenty-two years.
- You're disgusting. - Why ? Do not exagerate.
It's a sensitive subject. We should stop.
So that they say they broke up because of us?
Exactly.
I'm telling you, if you find out that Ziad is cheating on me,
tell me, and I won't hold it against anyone.
- Are you sure ? - If you insist…
Stopped !
She'll think you're serious.
Do not worry. They will never denounce each other.
They are all the same.
- Ice cubes ? - Thank you.
We are different.
Yes, like Macs and PCs.
Yes.
Truly ? And what are we then?
As men?
I say you are a cheap computer.
- Slow. - Bad at multitasking.
And you catch viruses.
We think, we analyze things more quickly. Like Macs.
- Not to mention the design. - Yes.
- Very expensive. - Nothing is free.
- Not accessible to all. - But you can't live without us.
What will Simi do?
- What is he going to do ? - All.
No wife, no kids, and a 23-year-old girl.
Twenty-two years.
Even better, 22 years old. He must be unhappy.
Poor guy, I pity him!
He will get a tattoo.
He'll post on Facebook and party at Burning Man.
If I was his wife, I'd take the car, the house, and all his money,
even his clothes.
Let him go see his girlfriend naked.
- He does it without his wife's help. - Oh yes.
But he does not live naked and his wife does not take everything.
- Ask Rabih. - I am different.
- I gave her everything, let her let me go. - Clever!
It's crazy how a text can destroy a family.
No, it's not because of that. It's because of an idiot and a bimbo.
Why did she check his texts?
Is it her fault for seeing the message?
No, that's not it, but… He's the idiot.
He should have erased it before Nour saw it.
If he wants to cheat on his wife,
he must be careful.
Comment ?
Hold on. Your problem is that he didn't delete the message?
Isn't he stupid and hurt Nour?
Careful, how?
Well…
What ? It's my fault ?
- Pass me that. - This is delicious.
Take  kibbeh. They are still hot.
Or are you afraid of getting burned?
- Delicious, Will. - Very good.
- What is that ? - Eggplant ?
No matter.
I say Ziad is right. You should be careful.
Sure.
What did I say ?
The problem is that our life is in there.
I bet we'll all get divorced if we check our phones.
Maybe you're right.
I never checked my husband's. If he left me, who knows...
Honey, if you want it, here it is.
- Sheriff's phone. - No.
- Do what you want. - No.
- Go ahead. - Sheriff. We eat.
- Don't get in trouble. - No problem. Take.
No problem. He is shivering because he is cold.
- He turned pale. - The farm !
- No problem. Checked. - No.
At one condition. Also give your phone.
Here. No one calls me except the children's doctors,
or his sister who calls every hour about their mother.
- Doesn't she have anyone else? - You do not answer.
If Ziad asks to verify your phone, will you accept?
He can see what he wants. I do not have a code.
No need, darling.
I trust you.
Wow! Incredible. I envy you.
My husband would rather swallow his phone than let me touch it.
- Right, honey? - That's not true.
Take. Check what you want.
You'll find pictures of naked women, but that's my job.
Cheers, man!
You are lucky.
- Need an assistant? - Not you.
You are all open-minded,
nobody hides anything and there are no secrets between us.
Of course May. They are angels.
Simi was the only asshole.
It is not fair. Each of us should have...
Hold on ! Have what ? Secrets ?
We've been friends for 20 years. Are we going to have any secrets?
I wish we had. It would be more fun.
If you want to have fun, we can.
What ?
Let's play a game.
- Let's go. - Which game ?
Easy. We put our phones on the table
and we continue with dinner.
And everything we receive, calls, messages, e-mails...
Naughty!
We watch and listen together.
Oh, the villain!
What are you afraid of ?
I thought we had no secrets?
They said that and that's why we said we would play. I adore !
- But this game… - It's fun.
We will have fun. I'm in.
Bravo.
You want to play, let's play. I am on it.
You are yes virile!
You are serious ? Truly ?
What ? You are scared ?
I am not afraid.
Are you showing off because your girlfriend isn't here?
I said I would play. I have nothing to hide.
Nothing to hide…
The farm ! Even your mother doesn't talk to you.
Why challenge us with that?
- What's the point ? What is your purpose ? - Any.
Why are you worried? Are you hiding something from me?
No, but I'm afraid you're hiding something from me.
May be.
I do not want to know it. I do not care.
It was his idea. Why would she hide anything?
You may have something to reveal,
something you hide.
- That's the detective in you… - Yes!
Serial killers do that.
They expose themselves to show their criminal genius.
Are you a killer?
- Exact theory. - It's true.
We are having fun. We stop if it's boring.
- Like "truth or dare". - That's stupid.
Ziad, prove me wrong and put your phone down.
What's the problem ?
Should I be worried?
- Why this ? - Then go.
- Satisfied ? - Yes.
I do not have any problem.
Do you really play?
What ? No, guys. It will not work.
It's rude to have your phone at the table.
He has manners.
Simi was full of good manners. He turned off his phone at the table.
Sherif hides it too. He thinks I don't see him.
I am not doing it on purpose. It's like that.
Truly ? To protect the screen. Yes, it is expensive, 200 dollars.
- No darling. Here is the phone. - In front of us.
Visible side. Destroy it, do what you want with it.
How nice ! Leave them side by side.
Maybe they will unite to make babies.
Mignon !
But if your mother calls, I don't answer.
And if the owner of the dog calls, same thing.
Okay. Let's see how it will go.
- For God Sake. - Salvation.
- Salvation. - Oh, Sophia.
- Dad ? I can talk to you ? - Yes ?
- Yes. Excuse me. - Go ahead.
What time is it ?
Ziad, pass the  kibbeh.
Pass the  kibbeh.
Are you giving me money?
Sophie, your mother and you have to stop.
What are these fights?
Dad, she screams all the time.
How old is she ?
Eighteen next month.
Eighteen ! I still remember when she was playing sandbox.
Yes ? She was ten years old. Now she plays with our nerves.
Being a parent is a terrifying responsibility.
Let her father take care of her. I am tired.
It's nothing. You have to let go a little.
As they say, "God helps those who help themselves."
Or "Easy to despise what you can't have."
- It's true ? - Yes.
-R? - Yes.
"There is no point in running, you have to leave on time." S.
S? A proverb that starts with S?
- You started it. S. - S.
Know how to lipopette!
Where are my glasses ?
Know how to lipopette!
They are on…
- A text. Wait. - Who is it for ?
- Ziad. - It's me.
Alright, shall we read it?
Yes.
- What ? - "I want you."
- Who is it ? - I do not know.
Great start, Zeezo!
The scandal is coming.
- No… - "I want you"?
That means illico, right away.
Are you going to calm down?
I don't know the number.
Maybe it's meant for someone else.
How can you receive a text...
- It sounds too. - It's the same number...
- See who it is. - Answer.
Why would I answer?
- To see. - I don't know who it is.
Answer on the loudspeaker.
- That's the game. - OK, I answer.
- Hello ? - Loud speaker.
- Yes it's good. - Go ahead.
Calm. I put it on speakerphone.
Good morning !
Good morning !
Hello ? Who is it ?
Yes.
Hello ?
I want you!
Really despicable!
- Super ! - Ignoble !
Asshole.
It was stressful.
- Infamous! - We are having fun.
- A problem ? - It's funny !
I felt it was a joke.
You thought it was a joke?
- I swear. - Have you seen your face?
You were green.
- Dad ! - Yes Dear ?
Do you have my phone?
- Take. - Sorry, Ziad.
- Say goodbye. - Why say goodbye, May?
- I missed you ! Sit down. - I go. Bye.
- Bye. Be careful. - Bye.
She's not usually like that.
Usually it's worse.
Enjoy your lunch !
They grow up so fast. They despise everyone.
How were you at his age? A naughty boy.
A rascal!
No, in college, Ziad was... You were completely different.
How so ?
You were... I don't know...
He was stuck.
- Yes. And annoying. - Stuck ?
Do not listen to them.
It was nerd. She studied constantly. Boring.
Even his mother abandoned him.
I felt sorry for her, having a troubled child like you.
Schizophrenic or incurable. How did you get out?
- I got through it… - I…
Your mother came from Egypt to raise you, not your children.
Elevate ourselves.
I don't know if I will know how or if I can.
Are you pregnant and hiding it from us?
Oh ! No…
You try ?
- A little, finally… - The cow!
- We should celebrate! - It is still early.
- Congratulation ! - Celebrate what? There is nothing.
There is nothing…
It is not serious.
Let's celebrate the fact that two married people are sleeping together.
Do not pay attention.
It's just that married people don't sleep together as much anymore.
- What people? - Everybody.
How do they sleep then?
Usually.
Therefore…
they're trying for a baby and you're glad they're sleeping together?
It is not serious.
Cheers, guys! To all the future babies who will come to make life better.
- Health. - Zooz.
So I will drink to those who sleep together.
Since I know you, you don't like anything.
- You're never happy. - I said what ?
I don't understand that life doesn't work without children.
Those who have no children should commit suicide?
And then, given the current situation, it's better not to have children.
I'm not trying for a baby because I should.
- So why ? - Lots of reasons.
Give me one.
The children are cute.
They complete the relationship. They bring people together.
Two beings cannot be happy
unless there is a third between them?
Why are you doing your philosophy? You're giving me a migraine.
Whenever we talk about a deep topic,
you have headaches.
This "a baby gives meaning to my life" thing, I don't believe in it.
I alone will give meaning to my life.
Do you find me selfish?
I will continue to think like that. Health !
What are you talking about ?
Sometimes selfishness is having children.
How so ?
I think it's a sacrifice.
Have children for continuity and ensure the family line,
that they help you when you get older.
I find it selfish.
And this story of eternity. We barely manage in this life.
I don't care about any of that.
Sophie makes me happy. I don't worry about anything.
It's not that complicated.
- Children, there is no better. - Yes.
I love that they sulk when I tuck them in.
We end up playing in bed, then everyone falls asleep on their side.
I will be sad when they stop doing that.
You surprise me.
When they grow up and tell you to leave them alone,
and beg them to kiss you...
- I do not want to know. - You will see.
It's my sister. What do I do ?
- Answer. - Go ahead.
Yes.
- Yes, Yas. - On loudspeaker.
Put on speakerphone.
- What ? - Hold on.
Yes, Yas. Sweetie.
- Yes. - You're on speakerphone.
- Go on ! - You ruined everything !
- Do not say that. - Take it off.
- Say you're in the bathroom. - I can not.
I'm at May and Waleed's.
- Mash potatoes ! - We shouldn't have played.
Hello, Yasmine.
- Hello, Yasmine. - Salvation.
Good evening.
Is it urgent or can I call you back?
Call me back.
We have to talk about Iraq. We should decide.
- Good. OKAY. - Tonight.
Bye.
Goodbye, Yasmin.
Bye.
- Sorry, I ruined the game. - Well done.
- I panicked. - You suck at this.
What is Iraq?
Nothing. Yasmine applied for me there. Maybe I'll go teach there.
- Truly ? - I do not know.
- It is far. - Far ?
At half past one.
It takes an hour and a half to go from Qasqas to Cola.
What do you know about traffic?
We drive two hours a day to go to work in Egypt.
Seriously.
It's a great opportunity.
- Too many people are leaving. - Regular.
It's great over there. I would go if I could.
- Would you go to Iraq? - Yes. Right now.
- Would you go to Iraq? - Yes.
And you would leave everything here?
Yes.
Of course we have.
- Sorry. - Would you go to Iraq?
I say that to cheer him up.
How nice. Not for real. I applied to several places, but...
- without answers. - Do not take it badly,
they shouldn't have kicked you out of college.
I would have attacked them.
I don't want legal trouble.
And this Iraq story, I don't know if I want it.
I'll think about it calmly...
Take your time.
Yes. What's the rush?
- Come on, Ziad. - When I closed my shop,
I did not expect a miracle.
I quickly opened London Taxi.
I sell it because I need to change.
- You still have a loan. - You sell ?
Yes. I put it up for sale, but...
We will see its value...
I don't know, but I'm thinking about it.
- I hesitate… - You said you put it up for sale.
- I don't have any buyers yet. - Regular.
What can I do if everything goes too fast?
And how to compete with Uber and Careem?
Taxis are dead.
I am like that, avant-garde.
- I can't sit down. - That would be nice, though.
Avant-garde spirit. What was the oxygen bar?
I went there. I almost went to the hospital. I couldn't breathe anymore.
The gauge was skewed.
- Just my luck… - And the 3D shoe printer.
How much did you lose?
- And e-cigarettes. - Wireless.
At least I tried.
Wireless ? It was imagination!
I can't ask myself.
You are really dumb!
- What's this ? - There is thyme. Its good.
The food is delicious.
- Enjoy your meal. - My friend.
- We take control… - Yes.
You know Will?
When you live with a man, not a woman?
Like, two men in the house.
We get our heads around everything.
And in the end, she wants to be a woman. How? 'Or' What ?
What's your secret?
Do you still agree?
We argue a bit. Yes.
Have you finished the trial yet?
I will have to pay a bundle.
The lawyer says he's still the civilian.
It will be finished at the end of June. But I'm tired.
We'll be celebrating this summer.
I hope.
We ordered the second and the container sank in the sea.
It's better, like the second one.
- Thank you ! - Here.
Let's see who it is.
- Which ? - My father.
Answer.
- On loudspeaker. - OKAY.
- Hello ? - Good evening dad.
- Are you OK honey ? - I'm a little busy.
We have dinner guests.
- You're ruining everything. - And you were yelling at me?
I wanted to tell you that I spoke to Dr. Selhab.
He is ready to operate in two weeks upon his return from Germany.
Take his number. Set a date and tell me what happens.
- Good. - Bye.
- Thank you. I will call you tomorrow. - Bye.
- What operation? - It's nothing.
Tell us.
I'm getting my breasts done, okay?
What ? You didn't tell me.
It must have been a surprise.
You are a therapist.
And so ?
She is like other women.
It's nothing.
I didn't think a shrink would have their breasts redone.
What's the problem ?
That bothers you. You are not sure of yourself.
I'm not sure of myself?
A woman doesn't like her boobs so...
We'll see when you have children and your body is destroyed.
It's all over.
Why isn't Waleed doing the surgery?
It's true, Will. Why ? Let it be to your liking.
I dunno. Ask him.
She listens to her father and he refused.
He wants his daughter to go see a famous doctor.
Professor Selhab
works in Switzerland and sometimes operates in Lebanon.
But Dr. Waleed Sarkis? Never.
It is for ordinary people.
What are you talking about ?
- It's the truth. - No.
- I swear. - How so ?
It's not true.
- I'm not saying anything bad. - It's wrong.
- No. - Why do you say that ?
- Your father doesn't like me. - What ?
He wanted you to marry
someone classier, richer like you.
- So what ? - I'm telling you.
I'm not comfortable asking my husband to redo my breasts.
Even though you were the best doctor in Lebanon.
It's not good. We have to keep some things private.
And I feel like that takes away all the attraction between us.
Yes, you would lose that.
You don't like the attraction?
So ?
I believe in fair competition.
Let Dr. Selhab do one breast, your husband the other.
And we'll see who's the best.
I did not think about it.
I like her as she is.
Mayush! Well done, my daughter!
This lunar eclipse is starting to work.
May a raison.
Imagine going to see her for therapy.
It will not work.
He doesn't believe it at all.
Honestly, I don't like lying on a couch talking about my life.
Why not ? It feels good, even if there is no solution.
It's important to talk about it, otherwise you explode.
For Waleed, it's a waste of time.
I did not say that.
- That is your opinion. - No.
You think what I'm doing is useless.
No. I say our jobs are similar.
You work the head, I work the facade.
We make people relaxed and happy.
But it takes you years, and me, a few hours.
- May be. - Who is it ?
- Not me. - Me niether.
- Not me. - Ziad?
- No, not us. - It's the oven.
Stay. I go. Give your plates.
I am going to smoke.
- I'm coming. - I help you.
- I also want  mulukhia. - Thank you.
Welcome.
- Where is the lunar eclipse? - Forget that. Give me one.
- What ? - I'm in trouble and you're going to save me.
- What's this ? - A desaster.
Oh ? What happened ?
- No questions, no details. - OKAY.
At 10 p.m., I will receive photos.
- From whom? - No details.
What kind ?
Pictures. You don't get it?
- What do I do ? - What time is it ?
- Soon the disaster! - I'm screwed.
I thought about. There is only one solution.
Our laptops look alike. We chat until 10 p.m.
Are you serious ? So I get the photo?
- You are single. - No.
- Do you want me to be fooled? - Your girlfriend isn't here.
Why accept the game?
Because Mariam would have had doubts. It's just stupidity.
Beebo, please.
- My life will be destroyed. - Stopped.
If I get this, what will Mariam do?
She will bring the children back to Egypt. The family will be destroyed.
Have I ever refused you a favor?
- Sex pictures? - Pictures.
- Ordinary photos. - Do not say that.
- I'm going to get killed. - Lower your voice.
She sent me a picture in pajamas. Hello Kitty.
How old is she ?
She is of age.
Beebo, Rabih. Tell me you will help me.
- I'll take the rabbit. - Put it on the table, Jannoun.
- Did you hide that from your husband? - He knew it.
I will be in the hospital for a few days. How not to say anything?
I was going to do it.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- What's this ? - Nothing.
Nothing. I drank. I don't want to cause a scandal.
Don't ask me anything.
Yes. What scandal?
Recount. What's this ?
Waleed sees a psychologist.
Waleed, my husband?
He told me not to say anything.
He made me swear. Don't tell him you know.
Maybe he thinks you're a bad psychologist.
- You take it well. - What's this ?
- Who? - Steve Jobs.
- Who? - Steve Jobs.
- He is not dead ? - He's calling my wife.
- Mariam! - I know, it's my phone.
- Don't make a scene. - OKAY.
I'm coming.
- It's mom ? - No. It's Steve Jobs.
Answer.
Oh okay.
- Loud speaker. - Here.
Greet, Emilio.
- Sorry for calling so late. - No problem. What is it ?
Your computer is ready. We're done.
Great, I'll be by tomorrow at 4 p.m. Okay ?
When you want.
- Okay. Thanks, Emilio. - Have a good evening.
- It's Emilio, for my PC. - You called him Steve Jobs.
- It's a joke. - Is the driver Schumacher?
That's enough !
A text.
Oh Ziad. You also.
It's Fared.
Fareed for the soccer game tomorrow.
Me too. Fared.
Me too. Fared.
- I got nothing. - Oh yes ?
- You'll have it. It takes time. - Yes of course.
Do you have a group without me?
What…
- You know how he is. - No. How is he ?
Fareed. You know Fareed.
He forgets his own children. It's just Fareed.
Don't make a big deal out of it. Come with us tomorrow.
Come play tomorrow and forget.
If you don't feel like playing, stay on the bench. Come.
Stop your bullshit.
Is it written "idiot" on my forehead?
When I was fat, you wouldn't let me play.
You call me when you need a guardian.
It sucks! Do you do that?
- No. - Do not listen to him.
I thought you were friends...
Friends ? They never text me.
- It's wrong. - You have the right to be angry.
That's enough.
I had nothing.
- Did I get a text? - Show me.
If you have nothing, turn off and on again. Sometimes that...
- Is it buggy? - Yes.
Who wants mulukhia ?
- I'm not hungry anymore. - I did it for you.
- A little. - Here comes the lamb.
- Brilliant ! - Leg!
Mulukhia , and then this.
- Which ? - This time it's just Ziad.
- Yes it's me. - Who is it ?
- Nicole. - And ?
"Call me. It's urgent."
With three dots. Well seen.
Who is this Nicole who needs you to call her?
I won't tell you.
Who is it ? We don't get it.
Nicole is the company coordinator.
Nice ! The coordinator.
- Nice title! - It's stylish.
Remind her. Let's see what she wants.
Nothing important.
It's probably a driver problem.
She always calls late and it's fixed the next day.
I like the way she defends her husband.
Bravo.
They just got married. It's too early.
Ziad, darling. You don't need to be defended. Call her.
She'll say it's important and we'll have to leave.
I'll spend the night dealing with the problem, no.
You can't stay up late. We're going to my parents tomorrow.
So, problem solved.
You should see this Nicole. She is round, not her type at all.
What is his gender?
- She has a birthmark. - A tattoo.
Delicious. You can really taste the rabbit.
- Great. You liked ? - Yes.
If he wasn't mad, he would have eaten us.
I want lamb.
Just a little bit.
- More. I… - And tomatoes.
Eat this.
- Waleed made them. - No onions?
- Delicious. - He spent the day there.
- What is that noise ? - My app.
- Where are you going ? - Wait.
Ready for training.
In position.
In three, two, one, let's go!
What is that ?
This is a 12 week app.
Two minutes a day, it firms up.
Looks like you just started.
Do you have to do it now?
I do it as soon as it rings, so that it works.
- Well done ! Come on, Beebo! - Thank you darling !
If it rings when you sleep, do you have to get up?
Awake or not, I have to do this.
If it rings when I'm sleeping, I dump it.
So what ?
You are fooling the app and yourself. And no results.
How many tablets do you have?
Laugh at me
with your round bellies.
- Practice completed. - Five minutes up?
Two minutes.
But it adds up. You understand ?
- I like it. - I will do it.
Anything that forces people to move.
I thought you had changed.
- That works. - Oh yes ?
- Yes, I feel firmer. - Yes.
Show me what I've done.
Leave alone.
Do you like mulukhia, Jana?
- I beg you. - Delicious.
- No acidity? - No.
Enjoy your meal.
Ziad, pas de mulukhia ?
Give me that.
Why didn't you say anything?
- Tell you what ? - That you see a shrink.
I know him ?
Non.
I know her ?
Since when ?
About six months.
You are angry ?
I do not know.
Maybe a little bit.
You have always been against. Why now ?
I do not know. I wanted to try so as not to regret it.
Try everything.
If one day we separate, I will not regret not having tried.
For example.
- That works ? - I do not know. Tell me.
I try to see things from another angle...
- As much as possible. - How so ?
As soon as we argue, it becomes a battle of egos...
We fight to see who wins.
Why can't I admit that I'm wrong for once?
Why ? That's what we should do.
I take a step back in order to move forward together.
I'm afraid of the direction we're taking.
That we end up like Barbie and...
What was her husband's name?
Ken.
She's plastic and he has no balls.
It sticks. I…
- I'm going to change. - Go ahead.
Its good. You haven't tried...
Rabih. You have a text.
He doesn't care, his girlfriend isn't here.
- Message from Isa. - Oh yes. Isaac.
Yes, Isaac. Not Rasha.
- Why are you screaming? - It's not Rasha.
No, Isa is a friend of mine. Sometimes she sends me pictures...
- The screen. - So ?
What's this ?
- Something private. - Show.
- No. - It's private ?
- It's not gambling. - Gambling is not sacred.
Don't ruin the game when it's your turn.
I don't spoil anything.
Don't force me to take it.
Keep eating.
Ziad. There are things we don't show.
Please.
Ziad, drop it! It's private.
- Ziad. Gently. - I tell you…
Everyone had to show.
- Oh ! - What's this ?
- Wow! - What ?
- No, Mariam. - What ?
- I dream ! - You scratched the screen.
Doctor.
- Just in time. - I want to see.
This is your territory.
- Mariam, it's indecent. - Am I a teenager?
Why not me ?
Who is it ?
Show me ? What's this ?
- What's this ? - She sits on her face?
It's his thigh. Who is it ?
Is that your girlfriend, Rabih?
- The second ? - But no…
Looks like a gymnastics champion.
I believe it's yoga.
- Rabih is out of control. - I do not understand.
The doctor doesn't know if it's his thigh.
That's enough, Mariam.
Good game.
Tiger !
Cheers to Isa and Rasha!
Health !
- No, actually. To Rabih! - Health and thank you.
I don't want any more questions.
- Good taste ! - Okay.
ROY: ARE YOU BETTER?
A text.
- Whose phone is this? - You.
- Yes. - Is that your ringtone?
Sara or Emad must have changed it.
It's Roy. "It's better ?"
- Who is Roy? - A new adviser.
Never heard of it.
He is new. He's a good guy.
Why is he contacting you?
We had problems today.
I got angry with the team.
I did scream. He checks that it's okay.
Yes, you told me.
You do not answer ?
- No. - Why ?
You're amazing. It'll only take a minute.
Reassure him: "I'm home. Everything is fine."
- Okay. - Why lie ?
No need to lie.
- No. - Finally…
Don't say you're not home.
Say you're fine and you're having dinner with friends.
- Yes. - No need to know where you are.
It's your company, right?
It's a matter of principle and privacy.
"I'm having dinner and I don't want anyone to know where I am."
It's okay, but he asks.
- He wants to know. - It's none of his business.
- This is your company, isn't it? - Yes.
He doesn't have to know where you are, with whom,
and what you do. He is nosy.
Leave me alone !
Why are you screaming?
- How are you ? - Calm down.
Rabih, calm down.
Calm down.
Calm.
Are you stressed? It is not serious.
Yes, because these stupid phones
destroyed our lives and let them be.
We let them into our lives and every time we sneeze,
the whole world should know.
We can't go left, right,
they control us and we let them!
To hell with telephones and their inventors!
- OKAY ! I don't answer. - No !
I don't answer.
- You should not. - OKAY.
He is right.
What got into him?
I feel like this eclipse is having a bad effect on us.
- You have an email. - Me ?
I have a message.
- You are scared ? - No why ?
- Open it, let's see. - Take. Looked.
"Alexander Voyages, 550 dollars, Bodrum."
- You can also pay by check. - You are saved.
Nice. Mariam's phone.
- Yes. - I'll show you something.
Google, read my email.
- No emails. - Even Google doesn't understand you.
I have a message, not an email.
Where did you see the email?
Let me go, will you?
Google, read my post.
A new message.
Good evening ! Sorry, I'm late,
but I was waiting for the guy from the apartment to call me back.
The apartment you saw is the only one furnished
and will be available in two months.
The others are busy.
My mother-in-law is very happy there, so I recommend it.
It's very useful.
And the girl who helps him can also help your mother-in-law.
Call me when you can. Bye.
It's Rania.
A flat ?
She was visiting her mother and she showed it to me.
- His mother ? - Yes.
The apartments next to our house, the new ones.
Very pretty, very classy.
- Mariam? - Yes.
Why ?
- Because. - Be honest.
Are you planning to fire my mother?
- What ? - Just say you don't want to see her,
- and I will send her back to Egypt. - Why do you think that?
What did she do to you? She loves You.
- She tells me how precious you are. - I know.
- What ? - I know.
She left Egypt to be with the children.
To help us, you and me.
Not true ?
- True or false ? - Yes, but… Yes.
Well, you know I love her,
but you can't pretend not to see anything.
She didn't come to help me. You brought him when your father died.
Not to go to Egypt...
It helps you, not me.
I know and I see her forcing herself to sit with the kids.
- Our problem is not… - Stop it!
- Our problem is different. - Forget that.
That's enough. We're done. I stop.
Forget the rest.
Sheriff... I love Ziad's mother.
But if she decides to live with us, I don't think I can handle it.
Sorry, honey. Corn…
No, I know.
I can't live with my own mother.
Put yourself in his place.
What if his mother came to live with you?
We cannot compare. My mother is a widow, she is alone.
His parents live together. It's different.
Ok, but your mother...
She is a bit difficult.
Do you remember when she arrived without warning?
She came in, we were drunk.
He was dancing alone with...
After that, I never danced again.
No seriously. It's a love.
Your mother is a bit picky.
Yes, my mother is difficult.
What time is it ?
10h15.
We're gonna miss the eclipse. Go on.
I had forgotten.
- Go on. - Leave your phone.
No phone.
- I want to take a picture. - Only you.
Can we stop this game?
- I am tired. - Come on, Ziad. Let's go.
- I'm tired. - We'll get the jackets.
- Are your things outside? - Yes.
No, but... I want my jacket.
- Yes. - Come on, Rabih. You and me…
Brilliant !
There are always two.
They are two. The moon and its shadow. They love each other.
I'll see you on the dark side
Dark Side of the Moon.
- I have it in mind. - It's crazy.
God knows what the moon has in store for us.
Especially tonight.
Sorry for what I said.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I could never blame you.
We take a picture.
Let's go.
We enjoy the moon.
You complain every time we want to take a selfie.
- Come closer. - Go on.
You are far. Come closer.
- I'm going to move, let's see the moon. - It's okay, I'm on it.
Not Waleed.
- I have longer hands. - Good, okay.
Go on.
- Warning. - Let's go.
One. Two…
We smile!
- What does he want ? - I dunno.
- Who is Romeo? - Her ex.
He is sad because he is watching the eclipse alone.
Without its moon.
Yes.
I don't know what he wants.
Are you taking the picture or not?
- Go on. - Zooz…
Why did you put him under Romeo?
That's his name. What will I put?
Her last name. Or better yet, don't keep it.
What ? You exaggerate.
- She said it was her ex. - Exactly.
Exes are sometimes dangerous. They cannot be trusted.
Jane. Who broke up?
- You dumped him? - Yes.
Let's take the picture.
- Yes. - Go on.
- Go on. - Come on, Ziad!
Listen!
- He's good for nothing. - Damn picture!
It's a matter of principle.
We know that you are a man of principles.
Go on !
Listen!
Wait. I will count. One. Two…
We smile!
Glad he's good for nothing.
What is going on ?
- Relax. - Tell me !
I'll explain.
Explain to me what?
He wrote to you that he wanted to fuck.
- His balls are full. - The farm !
Can I explain to you?
Romeo is in love and things are going badly.
She's got a boyfriend and she's marinating him. Here.
- What relationship with you? - He tells me about her.
- I'm her friend. - Everything is fine.
- Friends. - He takes you for his friend.
And he wants to fuck?
Who is it, by the way? Eh ? Mess !
Someone I know.
She sleeps with him but she has someone and he chases her like a dog.
Normal that he calls the vet.
- Okay. I stop. - And sex in all this?
I told you. Romeo wants to sleep with her
and she takes advantage of him, she doesn't care about him. Here.
It's not funny.
Ziad, we're kidding.
- You are overstepping the bounds. - We're joking.
Come back, man.
Good game ! Incredible !
- I do not get it. - You know what ?
I let him explain to you.
I won't talk to him.
- He'll explain it to you. - No.
- It's better… - Stop it.
It's better.
It's necessary ?
- Hello ? - What happened ?
I was thinking of calling him.
- I want to see her. - Romeo.
I told you she had a boyfriend. It's useless.
She texts me saying she wants me.
Do not go. She's using you to piss her off. She is going to dump you.
Better not to go there.
I do not know.
I try to help you. Do what you want.
Okay. I will not go.
Okay goodbye.
- Jane? - Yes ?
Thank you.
Convinced?
How long have you been talking to him?
We talk to each other…
Often ?
I do not know.
- He calls me when he… - All right. Understood.
Alright, let's get back to dinner.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because it's not worth talking about.
You said we had to tell each other everything.
Everything that matters. Everything about us, our life.
He still loves you?
You doubt me ?
I feel like I did something wrong, but no.
That's not what i meant. But I don't talk to my ex.
- Which ? - Any.
Any. They hate you.
They hang your picture and throw knives at it.
Knives !
If it bothers you, I'll tell him to stop calling.
- Please. - Okay.
That way you can talk to him in secret whenever you want.
If I promise him, I won't.
By the way, Ziad.
You do not have to worry. She was the one who dumped him.
Romeo wasn't in Iraq?
Yes, that's why she's following him to Iraq.
Stop it, you three.
I can not stand it anymore.
It's Sophia.
Answer him.
- Hello ? - Hi Dad.
- Yes Dear ? - You can talk ?
Yes Dear. How are you ?
Do you remember what we talked about?
Jeelo asked me if I could sleep at his place. His parents are away.
Dad ? You hear me ?
Yes Dear. What did you tell him?
I didn't think he would ask me tonight.
If I refuse, he will be disappointed.
I do not know what to do.
Do you want to stay with him so he won't be disappointed?
If he doesn't understand why you hesitate,
and he's disappointed, that's a bad sign.
But that's not the reason, huh?
Of course not.
I don't know, dad. What do I do ?
Honey, that's a tough question.
For me, you shouldn't go there, ever. Corn…
You are free.
Do as you like. That's how you were raised.
Make the decision you want, but...
if you stay tonight, it will be etched in your memory.
You will remember it forever, and you will learn from it.
You understand ?
If you understand, you should go.
If you're still unsure or uncomfortable, don't.
Do not go.
You have all your time.
- Dad ? - Yes Dear.
Thank you. If I stay at Jeelo's, don't tell mom.
Tell him I'm staying at Tina's.
Why not call him to tell him?
No. You know her.
She will get angry. She never listens to me.
It's wrong.
Your mother always listens,
but it's not easy for her.
She thinks you're not listening to her.
Dad, I have to go. I love you.
I love you too darling.
Be careful on the road...
She's lucky to have you.
The therapy works.
Y'all know I'm seeing a shrink?
You do not know it.
It's been six months.
It's going very well.
Welcome to all !
Too much information. Sorry.
TU M'IGNORES ?
Your frog is calling.
- It's Roy. - Yes.
"Tu m'ignores ?"
He is annoying. It's annoying.
Answer and reassure him.
Good.
I will tell him…
I dine with friends.
I dine with friends.
To send.
Rabih, will you pass me the water?
- The rice pudding is good? - Delicious.
- "Fuck you!" - What ?
Pardon ?
Is he stupid or what?
- He dare say that? - I dunno.
Nobody knows him.
- Unless you. - I do not know him.
Well, not well.
It has just started.
It's weird to get upset for no reason.
Unless he's an idiot. Yes, he's an idiot.
Good.
Couldn't this idiot be a girl named Arwa?
Arwa? Who is Arwa? No.
A new secretary?
Flirting with his boss and insulting you.
And lipstick on the shirt.
No, you're kidding.
Oh ! He calls.
Answer him, so we know why he's mad at you.
Go ahead, answer.
- Answer. - Okay. I will answer.
- Hello ? - Why are you doing this to me ?
You lie to me, right?
You said you were sick.
And you have dinner with your friends!
Hello ?
Why are you not responding ?
I'm watching you.
Kiss my ass. You don't know what you want.
Do you want me or not?
Say it.
You know what ? I do not care. Go to hell.
I do not understand.
I don't get it.
He is crazy.
I do not understand. It means…
Non.
I fire him tomorrow. It is a danger for the company. It will not work.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Are you going to believe it? No.
What ? Of course not. Me ?
I like men ?
Say something, Mariam.
I didn't know he...
That he was like that.
It couldn't be seen.
He has a crush on me.
It's a joke. It's a joke.
What is this look?
- Why didn't you tell me? - Tell you what ?
Tell you what, Mariam?
Help me, Waleed. Ziad, she suspects me.
It's possible. It happens. Many men…
- They… - Yes.
No, wait.
- Say something. - What ?
- It's your boyfriend ? - What ?
You are together ?
- In bed, as a couple… - Are you crazy?
- What ? - Mariam? Calm down.
Lots of gay men try with men…
- I want him to answer. - What ?
- Did you sleep with him? - What ?
Do you hear yourself?
We've been together for 15 years. We have Sara and Emad.
And you don't know what I like?
Conceived ? What an idiot!
Mariam! Look at me.
- Look at me. - I don't know who you are.
I am your husband. Do you see me with a man?
Can you imagine me with a man?
Mariam! Be rational.
I am your husband and you know me so well.
Do you think I would like it?
People are free. But I'm not like that.
I love women. I love you. You know it very well.
He apologizes and asks you to forgive him.
He misses your lips.
Disgusting!
I can't believe it.
I do not believe it.
How? 'Or' What ? Sheriff.
When ? I do not know.
What is this story ?
I can not believe ! Who is it ?
Tell me it's wrong. I dunno.
Je…
- I do not know what to say. - Shut up, it's better.
- What did I do ? - That you did ?
- Ask yourself. - Nothing.
Nothing ? Are you sure ?
I'm well.
- Something bothering you? - No.
Nothing ? Nothing bothers you?
- Leave him alone. - Who's stopping him?
I don't know why he hasn't said anything in 20 years.
There he wants to talk.
- What would I say? - What ?
Do you have something to say?
What ?
We've been friends since elementary school. I look at you and I don't recognize you.
What changed ?
- He's still your friend. - That's what I thought.
There are so many things I don't know.
- He should tell me, he's my friend. - Truly ?
- Yes ! - Why ?
Why ?
We lived in the same house. We slept next to each other.
We lent each other our clothes.
I have the right to know if my friend, with whom I've done a lot of things,
love men!
So I will decide.
It may not affect me, but tell me.
Up to you to decide. It could affect you and...
Do you hear yourself? Do you know what you just said?
- You know what you didn't say? - Calm down.
You exaggerate. Calm.
Am I exaggerating? Am I crazy?
Is this normal for all of you?
May be. I could be wrong. I have to go. Good night.
- No. - Jana!
It's my fault.
I thought we were friends and we accept our friends as they are, but...
Sheriff may be telling the truth.
You believe him ?
Maybe this guy is crazy and wants to get Sherif in trouble.
It's possible.
It could happen.
There is something wrong.
My husband's lips miss him.
Do you understand what that means? Not me.
It's true.
How long has it been?
Answer me, I beg you.
Do you know how long you haven't touched me? A year !
Maybe even more.
Why ? You let me waste away while you live your life?
Answer!
Yes, I saw him all the time on the phone,
but i thought to myself
that was all. Nothing serious.
I never thought a man would take you away from me.
I thought I had a problem. But it's you!
I'm a woman. You are not a man !
Show me your lips!
I do not remember. Conceived ?
I have something to say.
Tell me. How many men were there before Roy?
Answer me. How many ?
- Which one are you? - Okay.
- You drank too much, as usual. - Yes !
He will blame the alcohol.
- Even that. - Let's go.
Is it the alcohol's fault? No !
- Let's go! - Your friends have a right to know.
We'll talk about it at home.
- No ! - Let's go.
Do not touch me. Which house ?
I will not return.
Go back to your hovel alone.
Phone.
Your phone.
Maurice.
- Hello ? - Loud speaker.
Why are you not responding ?
I called him lots of times.
I know, Maurice. Corn…
Looks like you forgot me.
I need payment.
Come by tomorrow, I'll see what I can do.
Tell me. She liked the ring?
Yes.
- Mauritius. - And the earrings?
I will call you tomorrow. Go tomorrow. Bye.
What earrings?
Yours.
I don't wear it. My ears are not pierced.
I saw them at Maurice's and I liked them,
so I thought to myself...
You lie to me, right?
I mean… What a stupid game!
We're just arguing. Everyone interprets things in their own way.
Who are the earrings for? Answer me. For who ?
Answer me, Ziad. For who ?
Nicole !
Answer him.
- No need. She'll be… - Answer her.
Answer him.
As usual, she...
What are you doing Jana?
What do you do ? Give me the phone.
- Give me the phone. - Hi darling.
Sorry to call so late, but I can't take it anymore. I panicked.
I did the test and there are two traits.
I think I'm pregnant.
Two lines means that, right? Tell me it's wrong.
Hello ?
Answer me, Ziad, because I can't take it anymore.
Answer me, darling. Answer.
Open the door !
You filth!
How are you ?
Yes.
I do not believe it.
We've been married less than a year.
One is happy…
We make love every day.
Why ?
So many questions, Jana.
I do not know what to say.
I didn't want to get married.
I never believed in the marriage lie.
I should have stayed like that, lived alone.
Yes, alone, but free.
I even thought about having a baby.
I love children, but… I was scared.
And I believed him.
I followed him and fell in love.
He convinced me that we could be happy.
Stop it, Ziad. Not now.
Mariam, open the door. It's Sheriff. Open.
Open the door. You have a message on Facebook.
- He asks if you are wearing panties. - Let go of me.
Don't make up bullshit to cover yourself up.
He's someone I chat with on Facebook.
He asks you if you wear panties?
I don't know if he is old or young.
I have never seen it.
- It's for fun. - Enjoy ?
And what do I do? Are they getting bigger? Looked.
- Do not touch me ! - Call him.
- Call him. - No.
- Go on. - I do not know him.
- I won't call him. - Call.
I never spoke to him. He could be with the family.
What about you ? What do you have, a cold?
- Call. - The farm.
- Don't call. - I'm going to talk to him.
- I'll call him. - I won't answer.
- Here. - I won't answer.
Come on, have fun.
- I won't talk to him. - Have fun.
Hello ? Mariam?
- Hello, Mariam? - Good evening.
- It's you ? - Yes.
Sorry. I shouldn't have texted.
No problem.
I didn't think you would call.
I wanted to hear your voice.
Me too.
Do you think we could see each other?
We agreed.
You did not want to.
Yes, it's true.
- We can, if you want. - No, it's fine. I have to go.
Attends, Mariam. Attends.
- Hold on. - Yes ?
I never imagined your voice like that.
Me niether.
Do you believe me ? I am leaving.
A good woman puts on underwear.
- Are you okay or not? - Do not touch me.
Is that what it takes to get you to notice me?
You haven't known anything about me for years.
For you, his question is a huge betrayal.
But for me,
it's the only thing that makes me feel like a woman,
feel alive.
Instead of the man I live with who makes me feel dead.
You have to be a woman first.
I'll tell you something that's not on his cell phone,
- nor mine. - The farm.
- No. - That's enough.
They are your friends and they should know.
The day of the accident, I was driving, not Sheriff.
I was drunk and insisted on driving.
I killed that man, not Sherif.
I was afraid to surrender because of the children.
Sheriff decided to go to jail for me.
And this enormous sacrifice, I pay for it every day.
You told me it would destroy our family.
It's the case. It's not just the man who died.
- Stopped. - Me too.
- No. - That's enough.
You didn't notice
that we haven't talked about it since the accident.
Of course not.
I was praying
so that you stop blaming me.
That you tell me that you had forgiven me and that you still loved me.
By the way,
do you still love me, sheriff?
The same silence that has been killing me for years.
Why are we still together?
We are late.
You would have saved me so much pain if you had told me you were gay.
It's me who's gay.
I am the only one.
It's not my phone.
Sherif and I switched them.
So…
it's me who's gay.
Sorry, it didn't work.
The idea from the start...
Why didn't you say so, Rabih?
It was better, right?
Say what ?
The hour I spent with you as a gay man was the worst of my life.
My wife doesn't even know me.
My best friend wanted to kill me.
So…
Do you think they fired me because they didn't want to renew my contract?
It's because they discovered...
Rabih.
Complain.
Make a scandal.
I can't even tell you.
How do you tell everyone?
What world do you live in?
And my mother ? She would die of it.
Super.
You can introduce us to Roy if you want.
I do not think so.
After what I saw tonight...
I do not believe.
Not because I care what you will say...
But I want to protect him.
That's what people who love each other do, right?
They protect themselves.
This side.
And all that.
Open. That's enough.
Open.
Jane, open up.
- Jana, open up. - Open.
- Jane! - Let's break down the door.
Open, that's enough!
Pushes you !
Your mother called.
I told her she would be a grandmother. She's happy.
You're right not to introduce Roy to them. Keep it to yourself.
What are you waiting for ?
Am here.
Move. Am here.
- It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yes.
- Back to normal. - Beautiful.
What are you looking at ? The eclipse is over.
- Come on, Sheriff. I'm cold. - Okay.
- Salvation. - Bye.
- Call us. - And tomorrow's game?
I don't know what they decided.
It may be cancelled.
If that happens, call me.
- Yes. Sure. - Yes.
- Kisses. - Bye.
- Rahib! - Oui.
Next time bring Rasha.
- Yes. - Sure.
- You'll love it. - Sure.
Go on.
- Let's go. - What is happening ?
- I saw you drinking. - A sip. It's nothing.
You do not have the right.
What a pleasure!
Why didn't you want to play?
I didn't like the idea.
Are you afraid of something?
Me ?
Not at all. Why would I be afraid?
I do not know. Tell me.
Because we will collapse.
All.
Some collapse before others, but...
We are all vulnerable.
Especially with this.
All our secrets are there.
We can't play with it if we don't know when it will explode.
But I have nothing to hide.
Check what you want.
I don't even have a code.
Pretty earrings.
Are they new?
Yes.
I WANTED TO KISS YOU.
Are you texting?
Yes, to Waleed and May to thank them.
- They are awesome. - Yes.
ME TOO.
- We had fun, didn't we? - Yes.
- It's Nicole. - Do not answer.
She needs to understand that you have a life.
You are right.
No matter.
The training will begin.
Prepare yourselves.
In position. In three, two, one, let's go!
