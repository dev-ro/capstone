A world in which the Titans seek to devour humans.
The humans are the hunted who have
lived behind walls in exchange for their freedom.
But the supposed peace was destroyed,
with the appearance of the Colossal Titan.
They're coming!
The Titans are coming!
Eren, Mikasa, you must survive!
Stop!
Eren Jaeger, who saw his mother
getting killed by a Titan,
became a soldier to get the knowledge
and skills necessary to end the Titans.
He and his fellow 104th Squad Recruits would be required
to take the risk of fighting against the Titans.
We already have the answer.
Humanity can't defeat the Titans.
So...
You want us to become Titan food, wasting all the progress
we have achieved through thousands of deaths?
No chance!
I'm going to join the Survey Corps and annihilate the Titans!
Do not worry. When we recover the land,
we will have plenty of meat.
Humanity is about to regain hope.
We can win.
Mankind's counterattack is about to start.
A deadly battle took place against
the Titans that invaded the Trost Dristict
Fire!
Humanity broke its chains and advanced
on the road in search for answers.
But a new discovery brought fear to mankind.
So, cadet Jaeger?
Can you plug that hole?
That... well...
I'm not sure...
I'm just as clueless as the rest of us present here.
Oh, sure, I'm sorry.
I think I messed up the question.
You'll do it or not?
Which is it?
Will Eren Jaeger be the savior of mankind or
a demon that will lead us to destruction?
Go, Eren!
Answer already, you trash.
What do you want to do?
I want to join the Survey Corps... and exterminate some Titans.
Oh, not bad.
Attack of the Titans
[Part II] ~ the Wings of Freedom ~
That hurt, Annie.
Can't you be a little gentler?
I only meet you accordingly.
It's because you don't hold back when you come at me.
If you consider yourself a man, shouldn't you go
a little easier on this fragile body of mine.
Huh? Your jokes aren't funny, you know.
If you're not as strong as me, then why
I'm the one on the ground and you're still standing?
The technique I used is different from what they teach here.
It's not like I used strength.
The weak have to resort to using self-protection
techniques against those who're stronger than them, you see.
It won't hurt you to know these kind of moves, too.
I understand, but let's take a break first, OK?
Let's go!
Annie... I give up.
I give up, you hear...?
Give up?
I don't need you to give up.
I need you to learn how to use your strength
and how to talk to girls.
Okay, I've memorized the move! Let me go already!
Really? Want to learn more of the same?
Why the hell did you come
flying down on us, Reiner?
Hey, Annie...
Why don't you teach those moves...
to me as well?
I don't know about that. These moves are intended for humans to use.
I really don't think someone like you needs them at all.
But I'm curious whether
they even work on a beast.
I-Is this for real? At last...
Hey, hey!
Are they gonna fight?
The most anticipated duel!
Which one wins?
Will it be Annie?
Huh? Are you stupid?
I bet my whole dinner on Mikasa.
Which one would you pick, Eren?
I...
Which one...
Wait, why am I remembering
that all the sudden?
I wonder what the others are doing?
Where am I?
It's been several days.
Is there really a need to cuff me like this?
How long I will stay trapped in here?
Please bear with this a little longer.
We'll try to sort things out somehow.
Commander Erwin said that but...
They do not intend to leave me here forever, right?
So you're Eren, huh?
You okay? Feeling well?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
You're free to come out of there now.
That's assuming you wear these though.
I am Hange Zoe, a Squad Leader
in the Survey Corps.
The same goes for him.
His name is Mike Zacharias.
Um...
Oh, he has the habit of smelling people he's met for the first time
and snorting afterward. I'm sure it has no special meaning.
Oh man, sorry for wasting all our time only talking
about insignificant things. We're here already.
Well, no worries.
In fact, going in clueless is better for you.
Wait!
It's selfish of us, but we
can only put our faith in you.
Best of luck.
A courthouse?
I was under a courthouse?
Get moving!
Why are these people here?
What's going to be decided anyway?
You guys...
Now then, let us begin.
You are Eren Jaeger, correct?
You're a soldier who has offered his life for humanity, right?
Yes...
The trial will be a special court-martial in which common law
does not apply with the final decision left entirely to me.
Let us begin with the Military Police Brigade's statement.
Your honor, after conducting a thorough examination of
Eren's body, we dispose of him in a prompt manner.
It cannot be denied that his Titan Power
allowed us to repel the latest attack.
However, his existence is also a source of
discord that can incite an internal conflict.
Therefore, after having him impart all the information
he can provide, we'll have him die as a hero of mankind.
Now then, let us hear the
Survey Corps' opening statement.
Your honor,
We of the of the Survey Corps will
accept Eren as an official member
and use his Titan Power to
recapture Wall Maria.
That is all.
Hm? Is that it?
Yes. If we utilize Eren's power, we can recapture Wall Maria.
I believe it's clear what needs to be prioritized.
Wait a second! Wouldn't it be best
to seal all the gates for good now?
The only parts of the wall the Colossus Titan can destroy are the gates!
If we do it, they won't be able to attack us anymore!
Shut up, insolent boor! You are thinking of tampering
a gift from God with human hands?
That's enough of you, priest!
What?!
Order in the court.
You may argue about differences
in principles some other time.
Jaegar, I want to confirm something:
Can you continue to contribute to mankind as you have
thus far and utilize your Titan Power to that same end?
Yes! I can!
Really? But in the report for the
Battle of Trost District, it said:
"Soon after transforming into a Titan
he swung his fist at Mikasa Ackerman."
What, you wanted me to
lie in a report?
Is Mikasa Ackerman present?
Yes, that's me.
Is it true that Jaeger attacked
you in his Titan form?
Yes, it's true.
As I thought, a Titan will
always be a Titan, after all.
I tried to kill Mikasa?!
Me?
Mikasa Ackerman lost her parents at
a young age and was taken in by the Jaegar family.
Furthermore, through our investigations,
we have uncovered some shocking events.
At the age of nine, Eren Jaegar and Mikasa Ackerman stabbed to
death three men wanted for robbery and kidnapping.
Though this falls under legitimate self-defense,
I feel their basic human nature should be questioned.
Is it true?
No doubt he is a Titan who infiltrated
as a child, hiding among us.
Her too.
It is doubtful whether
she is human or not!
That's right, maybe we should
dissect her just in case.
Wait, please! I might be a monster, but that has
nothing to do with her! Nothing at all!
As if we could trust you!
It's the truth!
He's covering for her because it's true!
No!
I mean... you're wrong.
So far, all of you've been doing is blurt out
convenient speculations the way that suits you.
Wh-What did you say?
To begin with...
I should stop.
you've never seen a Titan before,
so what are you so afraid?
I must can't say any more.
No, I'll keep going... I'll make my stand here!
How can we afford to not
let those with power fight?
If you are afraid to fight for survival,
then, lend me your strength!
You... damn cowards.
What?!
Just shut up and bet everything on me!
Take aim!
Y-Yes!
Wait, Mikasa!
Maybe it's just my opinion, but I think
pain and discipline go hand-in-hand.
What you need right now
isn't a lecture, but training.
You're in a good position for me to kick too.
Wait, Levi...
What?
It's dangerous. What if he gets angry and transforms?
What are you talking about?
You guys are intending to dissect him, right?
Supreme Commander, I have a proposal.
What?
I know Eren's Titan Power has many uncertain
aspects to it, which poses a constant threat
so I propose he to be entrusted to Captain Levi
and taken out on an expedition.
You'll bring Eren outside?
Yes. I'd like Eren control over his Titan Power,
and his worth to mankind
to be judged based on the
results of that expedition.
Watching over Eren Jeager...
You can do this, Levi?
I'm certain I could kill him.
The problem is that there'll be no alternative.
I've made my decision.
"a few days later"
The former HQ of the Survey Corps.
An old castle that was renovated to be our base.
It definately looks extravagant.
It was used back when we were first
formed and our spirits were still high.
I never imagined we'd be keeping you
in that old decoration.
Do not get ahead of yourself, new recruit.
Excuse me?
You may be a Titan or whatever, but a brat like
you being under Captain Levi's watchâ€”
This is what you get for
yapping away on horseback.
First impressions are crucial.
That recruit was scared stiff.
Say, that's now how you usually talk, is it?
If... if that's your idea of imitating Captain Levi,
could you seriously stop it?
Then again, it's not like
it was similar in any way.
Are you trying to control me, Petra?
You haven't gone through the
proper steps to become my wife.
If only you had bit your tongue off and died...
So, these people are the
elite of the Survey Corps.
In other words: The Levi Squad.
They're all elites that were
hand-picked by Captain Levi.
And so...
if I lose control, they'll be the ones to kill me.
There are weeds everywhere.
This place is a mess.
It's been a while, after all.
The inside's probably covered in dust.
Now that's a problem we cannot overlook.
Let's get to work immediately.
I finished cleaning upstairs.
Which of the rooms should I stay in?
You'll be staying in the basement.
The basement again?
Obviously.
You've yet to gain full control over yourself.
If you accidentally transform into a Titan,
we can restrain you as long as you're underground.
That was one of the conditions given
to us in exchange for you custody.
It is a rule that we must follow.
I'll take a look upstairs.
Eren, you finish up here.
Understood.
An expedition to establish a base
for a supply chain in thirty days, huh?
And you want us to bring the
newly graduated recruits along.
That's assuming any of them enlist.
Regardless, I'd have to say this seems rushed.
Eren't current position is only temporary.
We need to prove to Central that he's
beneficial to mankind as soon as possible.
Otherwise, the Military Police
Brigade might interfere againâ€”
You can't be honest even with me, Erwin?
You're as sharp as ever, Mike.
I'm still not at your level though.
When the time comes, I'll tell you.
Ready to start, Eren?
When we are ready, we'll fire a smoke signal.
What you do after that is up to you.
Understood!
This dry well will be able to restrain
a Titan if it's out of control. Probably.
We have been studying the captured Titans
without finding out the most crucial part of the mystery,
but this time, Eren is here to help us.
How exciting...
That's the signal.
Controlling a Titan...
I haven't done that since sealing the wall.
If I lose control this time,
I will be killed by the Levi Squad, huh?
I wonder if he didn't see the signal?
No.
We weren't even particularly
certain of this in the first place.
Hey, Eren! The experiment is on hold.
Is something wrong?
Hange-san, I can't turn into a Titan.
The wounds you got from
biting yourself aren't healing?
Yes...
If you can't turn into a Titan,
sealing Wall Maria is nothing but a dream.
This is an order. Do something about it.
Sir.
Don't be so depressed, Eren.
But...
Well, this just means you're
more human than we thought.
I prefer this to rushing
things and losing lives.
This was not meaningless.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Hey! What happened?
Why now?!
Calm down.
Captain Levi, this is...
I'm telling you to calm down.
All of you.
Eren, what is the meaning of this?!
Sir?
Why'd you transform without permission?
Eld, hold on.
Prove that you're not
our enemyâ€”mankind's enemy.
It's your responsibility to do so!
Don't even dare twitch that arm!
The moment you do, your head will roll!
Oluo, I'm telling yo to calm down.
Captain, move away from Eren!
You're too close!
No, you're the ones who should step away.
Stand down.
Why?!
My instincts tell me so.
Well, Eren?! Say something!
Don't make any funny moves!
Prove it already!
I'm not sure what's...
You want to destroy us?
Answer me!
You think we can't kill you?!
Are you not listening?
We will...!
Please shut up for a minute!
Eren!
Can I touch that arm?
I can, right? Is it okay?
I'm just gonna touch it!
Hange-san! Wait a second!
Hot!
It's damn hot when there's no skin!
It's super hot!
Squad Leader, you're being too reckless again!
Isn't it burning you, Eren?
Isn't it hot? Eren, how exactly are you
connected to that arm?
I want to see!
I have to pull my arm out quickly.
H-Hey, Eren! Don't do anything weird!
Wait, Eren! That's too soon!
There's so much more I...
Captain...
How do you feel?
Not... too good.
Sorry for the delay.
They finally let me go.
Explaining to the higher-ups took some time.
Well, anyway, take a look at this.
A teaspoon?
Yes. Eren's Titan hand was holding onto this.
For some reason, there's no
deformation from heat or pressure.
Does anything come to mind?
I believe I was trying to pick
that up when I transformed.
I see.
Then that could explain why you weren't
able to turn into a Titan before.
"Kill the Titans."
"Defend against the cannon."
"Lift the boulder."
In every instance, you had a clear
goal before you transformed.
It's likely that self-injury isn't the trigger on its own;
you need some sort of objective as well.
It is similar...
But turning into a Titan to just pick up a spoon?
What the hell is up with that?
So basically, you didn't act
against orders on purpose, right?
Yes.
Wait, what are you doing?!
That hurts...
This is tough.
Eren, I'm surprised you
can bite yourself like that.
It was the wrong call on our part.
This is just our modest way of apologizing.
Our job is to keep you in check, after all.
We made no mistakes about that!
Don't get too cocky, brat!
I'm sorry, Eren.
We were too on the edge. You must be
upset by our indiscretion.
But even so, as we rely on you,
we also want you to rely on us.
So... believe in us.
Is Squad Leader Hange in here?!
The experiment subjects...
Both of the Titans have been killed!
Sawney! Bean!
Tell me...
Tell me this isn't true!
Our valuable experiment subjects...
Was it a soldier?
Yes. The culprit's still on the loose.
Apparently, it all happened before sunrise.
When a guard noticed, they got away with
their three-dimensional maneuver device
Sawney!
What's going on...?
Come on, the Military Police Brigade
will take over from here.
R-Right...
What can you see?
Who do you think is the enemy?
Sorry, forget I asked
When's the last time the shaft was replaced?
Six days ago, after the cleaning operation.
She checks out.
Okay, next!
You there.
From the 42nd Squad, I'm Krista Lenz.
We'll inspect your gear.
So you can be punished for killing a Titan too?
As strange as it sounds,
those were valuable specimens.
Even so, why are they searching
for the culprit amongst us recruits?
Yeah, everyone's exhausted from
cleaning up the battlefield until today.
The culprit must've really hated the Titans.
Yeah, but in this case, they pretty
much helped the Titans out.
Their lust for revenge must have been sated,
but mankind will suffer from it.
I'm an idiot, so I think I get it.
Before seeing a Titan, I seriously planned
to enlist in the Survey Corps.
But now, I'm not sure.
Today's the day we have to decide too.
Is Jean seriously...
Are you really going to join the Survey Corps?
Yeah.
Even after what happened to Marco...
But... aren't you afraid?
What? Of course I'm scared
of joining the Survey Corps.
But I'm different from that reckless idiot.
Eren, huh?
He's already in the Survey Corps, isn't he?
You know, I will not be risking my life
because someone convinced me.
At the very least, this isn't a decision
someone else can make for me.
Damn.
Hey, Annie, what do you think?
Jean of all people said he'd
enlist in the Survey Corps.
Nothing really.
You're set on the Military Police Brigade, right?
I should go there too, shouldn't I?
Say, if someone told you to die, would you?
What do you mean?
Of course not.
Then, why not decide for yourself?
Armin, what about you?
I think that if there's a legitimate reason,
there might be no other choice but to die.
I wouldn't like it though.
I see.
So you've decided.
Seriously? Armin, you too?
You're weak, but you do have courage.
T-Thank you...
Annie, you're actually pretty nice, huh?
I mean, it seems like you don't
want us to join the Survey Corps.
Is there a reason why you want to join
the Military Police Brigade though?
Not really.
I just want to...
save myself.
Everyone!
Olou, may I go speak with
my friends for a bit?
Jeez, just go already.
Hey, Mikasa! Armin!
Eren!
It feels like it's been forever!
Eren, did they do anything terrible to you?
Like inspecting every bit of your body
or causing you mental anguish?
No, nothing like that.
That shorty went way too far.
I'll pay him back one day.
You're not talking about
Captain Levi, are you?
Hey, Eren.
It's been a while!
Oh wow, you're all here?
But... if you are here...
Don't tell me, you enlisted?
Why else would we be here?
Then, the only ones who picked the Military
Police are Jean, Annie and Marco?
Don't tell me...
You too?!
Marco's dead.
What... did you just say?
Did you say Marco's dead?
It seems like not everyone dies a dramatic death.
We don't even know how he went down.
He died alone, without
anyone seeing or knowing.
Marco...
Hey, Eren...
I heard that, as a Titan, you tried to kill Mikasa.
Mind explaining yourself?
That's wrong. Eren tried to kill a fly and...
I didn't ask you.
I think it's true.
In my Titan form, I tried to kill Mikasa.
So you don't remember it, huh?
In other words, you weren't aware you had that power
until now and you can't really control it?
Yeah, that's right.
Hear that, guys? That's the situation we're in.
Our lives are in his hands. We'll probably die without
Eren even knowing, just like Marco did.
Jean, why are you driving
Eren into a corner like this?
You know, Mikasa...
Not everyone can die for Eren like you,
without getting anything in return.
We have the right to know what
exactly we're risking our lives for.
And whether it's worth our lives.
So, Eren!
We're seriously counting on you, okay?
Yeah...
Hey, recruits, gather up!
Your uniforms are here!
Commander, we're departing soon.
We've lured away all nearby Titans.
Thirty seconds until the gate is open!
It's time! In mere moments, humanity
will advance once again.
Show us what you're made of!
Opening the gate!
Forward!
We will now begin the 57th expedition!
Advance!
A 10-meter-class approaching
from ahead, on the left!
While I'm quite interested in the contents of its stomach
I'll leave this to the support squad!
Damn! Too shallow.
Defend the ranks!
Do not falter! leave it to the
support squad and advance!
Advance! Advance!
Olou, do you think my comrades
can beat the Titans?
Huh? What the hell have you
been doing this past month?
Listen, you damn brat, during expedition,
the point is to avoid the Titans if...
Assume the long-distance scouting formation!
Later, Armin.
Don't wet yourself even if you run into a Titan!
Right.
Same to you.
The vanguard will form a semicircle. Although we're spread out,
stay within eyesight of someone on all sides,
in fixed distance from one another.
Extend survey and relay range as far as possible.
We'll be fine. Calm down.
Red... red smoke signal...
Blouse! This way!
Damn! Looks like we missed one!
Let's draw it toward us!
Blouse! Come this way!
I'll handle it, withdraw!
Squad leader!
Go back to your position.
He's out of gas.
Strange... it's been a while since the red
smoke signal was fired, but we've yet to regroup.
Don't tell me...
A black smoke signal?
Is one ignoring nearby people and heading
straight for the formation center?
There's no doubt...
It's... an Abnormal!
Damn, guess we have no other choice.
Sys, you get its nape!
I'll stop it in its tracks!
Roger!
Arlert should be over there.
I don't want to let a new
recruit run into one of these.
We'll kill it here!
Now, Sys!
Squad Leader Ness succeeded!
We got it...
You came for me? That's why you're my favorite.
I love you, Charlotte.
Again?
What's the right flank scout squad doing?
If it ignored them and came this way,
then it must be an Abnormal too
I guess we have no choice.
Sys, let's do it once more.
Right!
But really, to think we have
to do this twice in a row.
And it looks like it's a 14-meter-class at least.
This one will be tough.
What's that? It's so fast!
Do not let it get to Arlert!
Why?! This is bad, what do I do?
It's behind me! I'll die too!
Go, run away!
She's not going to kill me?
What just happened?
She took off my hood and looked...
at my face?
Armin!
Reiner!
Hey, can you stand?
You're dead meat if you don't have
a horse outside the walls. Hurry!
R-Right!
From the right flank? Does that mean we
got hit so bad we can't continue?
It seems we lost part of
the right flank scout squad.
Hordes of Titans came.
That's the same direction she came from. Could it be...?
Was she leading the Titans here?
An Abnormal?
No, she's a human controlling a Titan's body.
What?!
The moment her vitals were targeted,
she flung Sys to the ground, crushing him.
She didn't kill to consume,
but for the sake of killing.
I get the feeling she's looking for someone...
Assuming that's true, she must be seaching for...
Eren!
Eren? But the Levi Squad, which Eren's in,
should've been in charge of the right flank
that she passed through.
No. They most likely are in the
safest spot of this formation.
So I guess they're somewhere in the center rear.
Armin, we don't have time to think right now.
At this distance, we might still be able to draw her attention.
We can buy time until everyone has withdrawn.
Jean.
I... I know what needs to be done now!
Not to mention, this is the job we chose!
Lend me a hand!
Armin!
She covered her nape.
Jean!
Damn, I can't get away!
I'm going to die!
Jean, avenge that reckless idiot!
Armin...
She stopped moving?
That's... that's the one that killed him!
He really ended up dying on the right flank!
Reiner?
It crushed my best friend with one stomp!
I saw his body stuck under its foot!
He's going straight for the nape!
Wait... that might work!
H-Hey...
Reiner, you...
We bought enough time, right?!
Let's get away from her already!
If she doesn't eat people,
she shouldn't follow us!
Look! The giant bitch got scared
and is running home now!
What... Why?
That's toward the center rear.
Could she be heading toward Eren?
Damn it, why?
Reiner's horse came back,
so why is mine still missing?
Armin.
Hey, Armin.
Looks like someone's coming.
With two horses, at that.
That's...
Krista!
Guys! You okay?!
It's my horse!
Whoa, whoa!
Calm down Bufpart.
It was extremely panicked when it ran to me.
Did you fight against a Titan?
Armin! That injury...
Are you okay?
Yeah, somehow.
I'm glad our smoke signal got through to you.
I happened to be nearby
when I saw Jean's horse.
Even horses seem to like you.
You must have some kind of special charisma.
You saved us.
But I'm so glad...
I'm so glad you all managed to survive.
A deity...
A goddess...
I want to marry her.
Anyway, we need to hurry back to the formation.
Oh, right. Withdrawal orders
should be relayed soon.
A green smoke signal?!
Looks like the operation is continuing
with just a change of direction.
Now way...
Shouldn't we be withdrawing?
What is going through
Commander Erwin's head?
Don't tell me the command squad
didn't see the smoke signals.
Whatever the reason, it's obvious
what we should do next.
Let's obey the order.
A green smoke signal.
Oluo, you fire it.
Roger that.
It seems like everything's
going well for now.
However...
Is that really the case?
Reporting in!
The right flank's scouts
have suffered heavy losses!
Scouting ability has been crippled!
Please relay this report to the left!
Hear that, Petra? Go!
Sir!
The right flank?
That's where Armin should be.
A black smoke signal?
An Abnormal!
Eren, you fire it.
Sir!
What a mess.
We let them too far into the formation.
The Titans are right over there.
Whoever it is fighting under that smoke signal...
The right side is all but annihilated, you say?!
And we're still not withdrawing?
Why?!
I do not know!
Commander's orders!
At any rate, relay it to the left!
What is going on?
We've been heading east for a while now.
The old town should be to the south though.
At this rate, we'll run straight in there.
Yeah, it's in plain sight already.
The forest of the giant trees.
Looks like Titans have passed through here.
There's nothing growing on the road.
The wagons should have no problem.
Relay this to the rear.
Only the center line â€” the wagon
escort squad â€” will enter the forest.
Um, Squad Leader...
It looks like the center line, is following the forest path.
At this rate, we'll run into the forest.
We're going around.
S-Sir!
All soldiers, halt!
All right, recruits. Listen up!
We'll now position ourselves to intercept.
If a Titan attempts to enter
the forest, stop it at all costs!
Huh? But, Squad Leader, why...
Shut up and obey!
Are you serious?
What the hell is going on?
A 5-meter-class incoming!
Captain.
Captain Levi!
What?
"What", you say?
We are in the woods!
If only the center line enters the forest,
we won't know if a Titan is approaching!
It seems like something's coming from the right,
but how will we avoid it or protect the wagons?
Quit whining about the obvious.
There's clearly no way
we can do either of those.
A black smoke signal!
It's right behind us!
It's the thing that came from the right, huh?
Everyone, draw your blades.
It'll be over in an instant once it appears.
Faster!
It's fast!
There's no way to avoid it in this forest!
It's catching up!
Captain, let's switch to
three-dimensional maneuvers!
Captain!
You're not getting away!
Reinforcements from the rear!
I have to turn into a Titan and fight!
What are you doing, Eren?!
That should only be done when
your life is in grave danger.
Didn't you promise us that?
Eren!
You're not wrong.
If you want to do it, do it.
I don't know the right answer.
I never have.
Even if I believed in myself and the decisions of
the comrades who've earned my trust,
The result was always a complete mystery.
That's why, you should just do your best to
make a decision you won't regret.
Eren!
Believe in us.
Eren, hurry up!
Decide already!
I'll keep going!
Target is accelerating!
Faster! We'll outrun it!
Fire!
After securing the horses up ahead,
switch to three-dimensional maneuvers.
I'll act separately for a while.
Eld will take charge of the squad.
Could they be...
capturing that Titan... alive?
It sounds like something
is going on inside the forest.
It's just as I thought.
I think the plan was to guide that female Titan
into the woods right from the beginning.
To be more precise, it's to capture the human inside it.
Commander Erwin's goal...
...was that all along.
That's what it was, right?
But new recruits like me aside,
why didn't they tell veterans like all of you?
Shut up!
Are you implying that we're not trusted
by the Commander and our Captain?
No, it's just as Eren said.
I think the Commander had a
reason for keeping this from us.
A transforming human... or perhaps, a spy working
with such a person is amongst us.
But how many soldiers had to die because of it?
If we knew there was a Titan privy to inside information,
things would've gone differently.
No, he wasn't mistaken.
The lives of a hundred companions,
or the lives of all those within the Walls.
The Commander made his choice.
He decided to cast off
the lives of a hundred comrades.
Hey, won't you come out already?
We don't have all day, you know.
If I'm not mistaken, you killed
many of my subordinates in various ways,
but did you take joy in any of it?
Oh, right. There's something I want to ask.
Is it all right if I cut off your arms and legs?
They'll grow right back, won't they?
I'm talking about your real body, of course.
It'll be a problem if you die, after all...
Bastard...
That was quite a scare.
Erwin, it smells.
Direction?
Multiple, from every direction.
All at once.
They're targeting the female Titan?
Titans from every direction!
All soldiers, engage the enemy!
Defend the female Titan!
It's no good!
All soldiers, retreat!
Assume the formation.
Return to Karanese District!
We've been had.
Just look at you.
Don't tell me you...
This shows the enemy was prepared
to abandon everything.
To think they'd have themselves devoured
to avoid leaking information...
I'll call up my squad.
Wait, Levi.
Resupply your blades and gas.
We're short on time.
What I have on hand should last.
Why?
It's an order.
Obey.
Understood, Erwin.
I'll trust your judgment.
Looks like we're done here.
Prepare to withdraw!
Did we really get them?
It's all thanks to you, Eren.
I didn't do much.
You believed in us, remember?
Back then, the choice you made
brought us to this result.
Sometimes it's difficult to make
the right decision, you know.
Oh, that must be from Captain Levi.
Save the rest for after we're back!
Erwin, why'd you have Levi resupply?
We don't have time.
The female Titan was devoured, but...
did you see the person inside get eaten?
I didn't.
Don't tell me...
Exactly, if they're the type that can move
to some extent even after transforming...
Furthermore, assuming they had a
three-dimensional maneuver device equipped...
Captain Levi?
No, that's not him!
Whose there?!
What happened?
Gunther-san!
Eren, don't stop! Keep moving!
But Gunther-san is...
Who is it?!
Protect Eren!
Is it the female Titan?
Or were there others?
The female Titan? Now way... How?
As I thought.
Here it comes!
It's the female Titan!
Damn, why you...
I'll do it this time!
I'll kill it!
Don't!
The three of us will take
down the female Titan.
You continue heading to HQ at full speed!
What's with you? Are you
doubting our abilities?
Is that so, Eren?
Are we really that unreliable?
I believe my squad will be victorious!
Good luck!
We blinded it.
It won't be able to see for at least a minute!
We'll finish it before that!
To hell with capturing it!
We'll kill it!
Die a dog's death!
We'll take revenge and take
down this damn Titan!
We'll slice all of the muscles around your shoulders
so you won't be able to hold up your arms.
Slice them apart...
And those arms...
Will drop!
They're down!
Now the neck!
Once the muscles supporting
the neck are cut...
We can get its nape!
It's over!
Eld!
But how?
It can't possibly see already!
Not even thirty seconds have...
Just one eye?
It prioritized one eye
to heal faster?
How is that possible?
Petra!
Hurry and right yourself already!
Petra, hurry up!
Hey...
Die!
Why?
My blade won't go through...
I'll...
I'll...
kill it!
Eren?
Mikasa!
That voice? Don't tell me...
Because I made the wrong decision...
Because I wanted to believe in my comrades...
everyone died!
If only I had believed in myself
from the start and fought...
If only I had killed her from the start!
I'll rip you apart.
I'll split you wide open...
Tear you to bloody shreds...
Mangle every last chunk...
And devour it all!
Eren!
Wait...
Eren...
Don't go...
Give Eren... back!
Give him back!
Why won't the blade go through?
Wait!
Wh-What are you...
Fall back for now.
Maintain this distance.
We'll stick to a single objective.
First, we'll give up on killing the female Titan.
But she's killed so many of our comrades!
As long as it can reinforce
its skin, we have no chance.
Trust my judgment.
We'll place our hopes on Eren being alive
and rescue him before she gets out of the forest.
I'll take care of it.
You draw its attention!
He's fast...
So fast that she doesn't have time to react!
The nape! I can kill her!
Stop!
Eren!
Hey!
We're pulling out!
Eren...
He should be fine. Alive, at least.
Filthy though.
Don't worry about it anymore.
We're retreating.
Aren't there fewer of them
than in the morning?
They've lost quite a few.
Yet another disaster.
They made a real racket when they left
in the morning, but they're back already.
What'd they go for?
Eren, you shouldn't get up yet.
Cool! The Survey Corps is amazing!
They get beaten so badly,
but they still keep fighting!
Commander Erwin! Answer us!
Did this expedition achieve something
worthy of the sacrifices?
Are you convinced the dead have no regrets?!
The expedition's expenses and casualties
were more than enough
to utterly humiliate the
Survey Corps' power base.
Those responsible, including Erwin,
were summoned to the capital,
where Eren's new supervisor
was to be chosen.
Keep at it, Annie.
Now that's my girl.
What are you doing, Annie?
No breaks!
Huh, you haven't heard yet?
Seems like the Titan brat and his chief
superiors were summoned to the capital.
They'll be coming through here today.
That so? Well, I'm sure they'll
end up dissecting him this time.
Stohess District
Military Police Brigade Branch Office
Looks like she's finally up.
You know, you look so scary when
sleeping that I didn't dare wake you up.
Sorry about that, Annie.
You've been slacking off too much lately.
What?
Mad already, are we? Come on...
Just leave her alone.
Annie's from Trost District of all places.
She's the only one with battle
experience in this branch.
You can't expect her to recover so soon.
I mean, she's fresh out living hell.
I told you to cut that stuff out.
Today, you'll be assigned to do
something outside your usual duties.
That's why I had you assemble here.
It's about the Survey Corps members
that were summoned to the capital.
They will be passing through
the town's central street today.
The Military Police Brigade HQ
is in charge of escorting them, but we're only
tasked with helping them get through town.
Move alongside the escort squad
and work to bolster their security.
That is all.
Annie.
Hey.
You're really part of the Military
Police Brigade now, huh?
Armin...
What's with the outfit?
I'm a baggage carrier.
I'm using this rain coat to hide my
three-dimensional maneuver device.
See?
What for?
Annie, will you give us a hand
in helping Eren escape?
Where to?
After rebelling against the monarchy,
where within the walls will you run to?
We're only going to hide out temporarily.
We don't plan to oppose them head-on.
It'll be reported as an act of rebellion
by part of the Survey Corps.
It will buy us some time during which we'll prepare
what's needed to overturn the commission of inquiry's decision.
Without fail.
Does something that convenient exist that
will make them change their minds?
Sorry, but I can't say.
I hate to tell you this,
but it's out of the question.
I won't say anything though, so do what you can.
Annie! Please!
At this rate, Eren will be killed!
Ignorant people, for their own self-preservation,
are unwittingly attempting to set
humanity on a path to extermination!
I know this isn't convincing, but even so...
all we can do is take a huge gamble now!
Say... Do I really seem like such
a good person to you?
A good person?
Well...
I don't particularly like that term.
I mean, that just seems like something you would
call someone who is any use to you.
And I don't think there's anyone
who's of use to everyone.
That said, if you don't agree to cooperate...
you would be a bad person in my eyes, right?
Fine.
I'm in.
We got through more easily than I expected.
That's the Military Police for you.
It's clear they work hard day after day.
Do not get distracted.
Now we'll just have to hope they
don't notice that it's Jean in there.
Can't expect that to work long.
We do not look like anything alike, after all.
Don't worry about it.
Both of you have a villainous glint in
your eyes and similar, evil-looking faces.
I don't have a horse face like him.
Hey, if I had decided not to help you,
how were you planning to get over the wall?
We planned to get past using
three-dimensional maneuver devices.
Impossible. To begin with, running before entering
Stohess District would've saved you a lot of trouble, no?
Why here and now?
I predicted the complicated terrain in this city
would make the switch more likely to succeed.
And rather than being openly defiant,
feigning obedience would decrease suspicion
and buy us more time to escape.
I see.
That makes sense.
There it is.
Here?
Yeah. We go through here.
The ruins of an underground city that
was planned and abandoned still lie here.
This path continues up
until near the outer gate.
Really? That's amazing.
Annie?
What are you doing? Do not tell me you're
afraid of dark, narrow places.
That's right.
I'm scared.
I'm sure a brave and reckless idiot like you
wouldn't understand the
feelings of a frail girl like me.
A girl who can flip a bigger guy
around in mid-air isn't frail.
Quit joking and let's get moving.
No, I won't go.
I'm scared of going that way.
Unless we're moving above ground, you're on your own.
What the hell are you saying?
Get over here already! Enough screwing around!
Eren, keep it down.
It's fine, isn't it, Mikasa?
Since for a while now,
there hasn't been anyone around for some reason.
Honestly.
I'm hurt.
Just when did you come to
look at me with such eyes,
Armin?
Annie, why...
did you have Marco's
three-dimensional maneuver device?
Down to the slightest scratches and dents...
Because we maintained our equipment together.
I recognized them all.
I see.
It was...
something I found.
But if you suspected something a month ago
why didn't you do anything?
Because I still can't believe it.
I wanted to believe I was mistaken.
That's why.
But... you too...
Back then... because you didn't kill me...
It came down to this, don't you see?
Yeah, I completely agree.
I never imagined you'd end up
cornering me to this extent.
Back then...
why... I wonder...
Hey, Annie!
There's still a chance you're an idiot
who has terrible timing with stupid
jokes that you carelessly throw around.
Regardless, just get down there
You can prove something by
simply stepping down here!
So come here and prove it!
I can't go there.
I've... failed to become a warrior.
I'm telling you, this isn't funny at all!
Let's talk this through, Annie!
We can still discussâ€”
I've had enough.
I can't listen to this anymore.
It's a waste of my time.
I'll slice you to shreds again...
Female Titan!
Armin, it's great that I was
a good person to you, huh?
Your gamble paid off this time.
But now...
I'll see if my bet pays off!
Eren!
Mikasa!
We were too late!
Annie...
Our plan is for the day after tomorrow,
during our passage to the capital where
we are to answer the summons at Stohess District
It will be the last chance for us.
We'll wager everything on this plan.
The plan is as follows:
As we pass through Stohess District,
Eren will act as a bait and lure the target
to this underground passage.
Upon bringing them to the lowest level,
judging by their size and power,
Their movements should be fairly
restricted, even if they transform.
Yes, sir. So the main target is in
Stohess District without a doubt, correct?
Yes. The target is part of the Military Police Brigade.
The Military Police?
Armin was the one who inferred that.
According to him, the Female Titan may be responsible
for killing the two Titans we'd captured
and is possibly a member of the
104th Training Corps, like you.
W-Wait just a second.
The name of the person suspected
to be the Female Titan is...
Wait....
Annie Leonhart.
D-Damn it.
Damn, that ring...
She saw right through me from the start!
She even noticed the ambush we planned too.
Hey!
Status of the primary plan?
Unsuccessful!
Please switch over to Plan B!
She stomped through?!
We have to save them!
Eren, get back!
Wait! Hey, Mikasa!
Is she trying to show she
doesn't need Eren alive?
She stomped through
wagering that Eren would survive!
I'll figure something out,
The same way I was able to block
cannon fire that time.
Step closer!
Here we go. Stick close to me!
Again?!
No way...
At a time like this...
Damn, it hurts!
If you don't have a clear objective,
you can't transform, right?
Visualize and focus on it again.
I know! But...
Deep down...
you're still hesitant to fight Annie, aren't you?
Eren...
Don't tell me you're still thinking
that we're mistaking Annie as the Female Titan?
Did you not see what happened earlier?
She was the one to kill our comrades, right?
Do you still not see that?
Shut up!
Can't you see I'm trying?!
Annie is the Female Titan?
Why... Why do you think that, Armin?
The Female Titan knew what
Eren looked like from the start.
Furthermore, she also reacted
upon hearing Eren's nickname, "the reckless idiot",
when only our generation should know about it.
And above all else, Annie was likely responsible for the killings
of Sawney and Bean, the test subjects.
How can you be sure about that?
Advanced techniques were required
to pull off those kills,
so she must've used her three-dimensional
maneuver device, which she's proficient with.
Yeah, but that's what the equipment inspection was for.
Annie came out clean.
That's because the device
Annie had was Marco's.
Huh? Couldn't you have
just been seeing things?
No, that was definately something Iâ€”
Hey, kid, we already heard that.
Is there anything else?
Not that I know of.
I believe that Annie's face
resembles the Female Titan's.
Huh? What are saying?
Eren, has anything come to
mind after hearing all this?
When you fought hand-to-hand with the Female Titan,
did it use any techniques that are unique to Annie?
You realize now, don't you?
The Female Titan is Annie.
In that case, shouldn't you be fighting?
Or...
is some particular emotion hindering you?
I have a plan.
Mikasa and I will exit from that hole
and the entrance simultaneously.
Doing so will force Annie to focus on one of us.
At that time, Eren, follow the one she ignored.
Wait!
Wouldn't that mean one of you will die?!
Staying here will get all three of us killed.
Mikasa, get in position!
Okay, I'll take the front.
Mikasa! Armin!
How? How can you two still fight?
How?!
What choice we have?
The world is a cruel place.
Eren!
Don't let the Female Titan get away!
We'll stop her from getting
out no matter what!
Eren!
I'm going to get you out of there!
Move!
Something is off...
There seemed to be some sort of explosion andâ€”
Nile!
Dispatch all your soldiers at once.
We should assume a Titan has appeared.
What are you saying?!
This is Wall Shina, you know!
It's impossible for a Titan to appear here!
Wait! Don't move, Jaeger!
I've had enough of playing doppelgÃ¤nger!
Don't ever call me that again, you idiot!
Commander, I will go too!
Get your equipment from the 4th squad.
Yes, sir!
It's good to be enthusiastic, but don't
forget to guard your own life.
Sir!
Erwin, what's going on...?
All of you, follow me!
We'll join the Female Titan capture squad!
Levi, you stay put.
You dislike meaningless death, don't you?
Yeah, that's right.
Whether it's mine or someone else's.
- It's a Titan! A Titan is here!
- Why here of all places?!
-Didn't they seal the wallâ€”
Eren!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Jean!
Eren is under this!
Huh? Shouldn't he have transformed already?
He wasn't able to.
The fact that Annie is the Titan might
be what's hindering him.
What?
We'll have to do something about her first!
Eren.
People who are unable to abandon everything
will fail to bring any change.
If it's required to overcome monsters,
one must toss aside their humanity.
I'm sure Annie is capable of that.
Those who can do it are victorious!
Annie!
if you don't kill me this time,
you won't be able to make excuses like
"I'll see if my bet pays off!"
Armin, this way!
Roger!
People who are unable to abandon everything
will fail to bring any change.
I know. When the time came...
I clung to my comrades and the bonds we shared,
yet I failed.
Think back.
I'll... destroy them.
No...
I'll kill them!
I don't have time to think about
whether it's right or not!
Just start by moving!
Don't get caught up with excuses!
Yes...
Mikasa!
The world is a cruel place!
What is it this time?!
Eren!
Eren...
A Titan?
Why here?
It's level ground!
The Female Titan is approaching level ground!
We can't use our gears there!
Divide into two groups and surround it!
Roger!
Why is there a Titan here?!
Annie...
You always seemed so disinterested.
But there are moments when even you look lively.
And that's when you demonstrate your
hand-to-hand techniques.
I thought you seemed like a terrible liar,
or so I thought.
Hey, Annie...
What in the world are you fighting for?
What great cause justifies killing people?
Annie...
Annie!
Annie.
Your father will always be on your side.
I will exterminate the Titans,
not sparing a single one.
Eren!
That's...
Eren!
Stop!
We don't know if Eren can recognize you now.
What, the wall...?
She's climbing it?!
This is bad! She'll get away at this rate!
Oh no you don't!
Annie...
fall.
Annie.
I was wrong.
I won't ask you to forgive me now.
But... I just have one favor to ask.
Turn the entire world against you if you have to.
I... will destroy everything in this world!
Even if everyone in the world comes to hate you...
At least know that Dad will be on your side.
Oh, no! He'll eat her real body too!
Eren, stop!
Eren!
I'm... free.
So promise me...
that you'll come back.
What happened?
What the...
They're fusing?
Eren!
Don't eat our valuable witness, you idiot.
Erwin, we have quite a few concerns
about your plan this time around.
If you had a target confirmed, why didn't you
seek the Military Police Brigade's assistance?
District Chief, there was a need to carry out
the plan with only those who could prove
that they are not one of the Female Titan's allies.
I see.
So, do you have any proof that you prevented
mankind's demise through this extremely costly plan?
I don't believe you can anything
out of Annie Leonhart as she is now.
Indeed. I agree.
So in other words, this was all for nothing?
Eren.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah...
Okay enough to feel sick.
Annie is still sealed away, I hear.
Yeah.
Damn it.
We pull off such a large-scale operation and gain nothing?
She went that far to withhold information.
Annie, I mean.
I failed at the end.
When I saw Annie, I couldn't move anymore.
Armin Arlert. Jean Kirschtein.
I'm here to question you.
Okay.
Us first, huh?
Well, see you later.
Back then, I thought it felt great.
It was almost as if I felt refreshed
to have my body torn apart.
Enough for me to think
I might as well die then.
Eren!
I'm not thinking that anymore.
I'm glad you came back.
Eat.
However, I believe I've grasped a great potential
with which to save mankind.
Compared to the time when we couldn't even
fathom humans transforming into Titans,
We've come a long way by
restraining one of our enemies.
Yes, they're definitely out there.
Let us bring all of them to their kneesâ€”
All of the Titans within the walls.
Now it's our turn to advance upon them!
The Survey Corps and Eren Jaegar's
summons to the capital were put on hold,
and custody of Annie Leonhart,
who is being held deep underground,
was given to the Survey Corps.
However, but for mankind to
know what they're being caged by,
more time and sacrifices were still needed.
Hey, look!
Inside the wall...
Do not tell me...
it's a Titan!
Squad Leader, your orders?
Wh-What? Hold...
hold on just a second...
Do not...
Do not let daylight shine on that Titan!
Well, it's time for us to talk, don't you think?
What is that Titan?
Why is there a Titan inside the wall in the first place?
And why have you people kept quiet about it?
I'm a busy man. My followers and I are in utter chaos
right now because you ruined my church.
Now, let me off the wall.
Don't mess with me!
Squad Leader?!
Stay away.
Do you know why we,
the Survey Corps soldiers,
repeatedly shed our blood?
It's to get back the freedom that Titans stole from us!
I'm not asking for a favor.
I'm ordering you to start talking.
If you don't, then I'll go find another.
In any case, I doubt that taking
only your life will be enough.
Let go... of me...
Are you sure you want me to let go?
Kill me and learn this for yourself...
We shall carry out our mission till the very end!
That's why I'm telling you...
Let go of me!
Squad Leader...
Kidding, I'm just kidding.
Say, Pastor Nick...
Are these walls... full of Titans?
