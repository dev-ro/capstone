{\an8}I'm Kev.
{\an8}Flora.
{\an8}I'm gonna be riding you later.
{\an8}No, you won't.
{\an8}- Hi, how are you?
- Flora. How are ya?
{\an8}I'm good.
Good girl, Flora.
- Mornin'.
- Oh, fuck.
Told ya. Do you go to
Shifters much, love, yeah?
Yeah, all me life. Great club.
Listen, uh, will I whip us
up something for breakfast?
A little fry maybe, you
know? Where's the fridge?
Uh, there's nothing in
it. Me son eats it all.
There's a son?
Yeah.
- Where is he?
- Don't know.
Supposed to be in school.
Could be anywhere.
I told you all about this
last night, in the taxi?
You said you were
cool with that?
Shut the door on the way out.
Have you committed any
antisocial behavior
- in the last few months of your life?
- No way, Guard.
Have you received any stolen goods
to the best of your knowledge?
Absolutely not, Guard.
Have you stolen any goods?
Not that I got caught with.
- Ow! Fuck.
- Answer him properly, you fucking idiot.
- How did you get the black eye?
- Fighting.
Did you never think of
joining the boxing club, Max?
No. They only wanted me to clean
up, mop spit off the floor.
- I'm not doing that.
- That's how Rocky started.
They have a new cycling
group in Mount Vernon.
Don't have a bike.
He sold it for a secondhand laptop
so he could play video games.
- That's not all I do on it.
- Oh?
Watch pornography on it too.
The Juvenile Liaison program is
designed to keep young people
out of the court system,
and so out of prison.
And we all know what they do to
pretty young lads like you in prison.
They anally rape them, Max.
We'll leave it there, son.
But I'm warning you now,
you're headed in that direction
with a string of offenses
the length of me arm.
One more offense and
you'll be behind bars.
Flora, find him something to do.
Something to keep those
light fingers occupied, yeah?
Ooh. Yikes. Look at you,
you big chocolate head.
Oh, yeah, sorry. She
found some in the kitchen.
No worries.
- How was your workout?
- Ugh, amazing. How am I doing?
- You look amazing.
- Yay.
Okay, Flora, you're
free to go. Thanks.
Right. Here's your baby.
- Thanks so much, Aishling.
- Oh. Oh.
See ya, Sorcha. See you Monday.
- Bye now!
- Thanks again!
No, no, thanking you!
Come here.
- Yeah, all right.
- You ready?
How much to fix this guitar up?
Let me see, uh...
Tighten the truss rod, a set of
strings, two new machine heads.
- Sixty euro?
- Fuck off.
Eighteen euro.
Do it.
Hiya.
What's that?
It's a piano.
Whose is it?
Wait, now, how many
kids do I have?
Well, let's see. One?
It's yours.
Where'd you get it?
Who cares where it came from?
It's a guitar. It makes music.
You used to be dead into music.
Happy birthday.
You fucking robbed it from
one of the houses, didn't you?
No, I didn't rob it. Play it.
- Don't want to play.
- Why not?
- Since when am I a guitarist?
- Since now!
- Jesus. You didn't even buy it for me.
- How do you know? Maybe I did.
Well, did ya?
No. But why does that matter?
Me whole life, you
never get me anything.
Then you come home with
this dusty piece of shit
the day after me birthday,
and expect me to turn
into Ed fucking Sheeran?
- It's a gift. Who cares?
- I don't want it.
- It's a crock of fucking shit.
- You ungrateful prick.
And you're a daft slag who
never gave anyone anything.
Don't talk to me like
that, you little prick.
Cunt.
You came out of my cunt, you
ungrateful little animal.
One day I'm gonna surprise you
and smash into your fucking face!
You'll be behind
bars before that!
- Good. Away from you!
- Go on!
Go back to your da!
You forgot your fucking present.
Hey, Da.
Come here, little man.
I'm in the Lamborghini.
- Flora.
- Ian.
Heard about the guitar episode.
So you had a little Harry
Styles on your hands, was it?
Who knows what he could be?
I mean, look at the genes.
It's not about the
genes. It's about dreams.
I gave up my musical dreams for
him. And you. You're welcome.
Here we go.
You do know we were on the same billing
as Snow Patrol the night you and I met?
Course I did. It's
why I fucked ya.
To think where I could be now,
if things hadda been different.
Mountjoy, Portlaoise,
Cloverhill.
Pick a prison.
Very funny.
Go on, you'd better go. They'll
clamp your fucking broomstick.
Anyway, I might learn
the guitar meself.
Okay.
Could be you're not the
only genius in this family.
Sorry, but you playing the
guitar? That's just too funny.
- Why?
- 'Cause it takes dedication,
years of practice,
sweat, commitment.
It's not just an overnight transformation
on some fucking reality TV show.
Took 20 years to build
up them calluses.
Are you really gonna talk
to me... about commitment?
Where is she?
At a nail bar,
getting a manicure?
Or at the surgery, getting
a Brazilian arse lift?
She doesn't need one, love.
You're disgusting.
And don't just sit on the couch
smoking weed and playing video games.
And her arse isn't that amazing!
Just FYI!
Oh, hey.
- Flora.
- Juanita.
- Awkward.
- Not for me.
I've been there.
You're welcome to him.
Thanks. See ya.
Hasta luego.
Fucking hell.
I can't go on like this.
Okay. Let's go.
- No. I mean, in life.
- Oh.
This can't be my story.
Living in a shoebox
with a kid who hates me,
and his da who doesn't see me.
This can't be my narrative.
He rejected your
prezzie. So what?
You didn't even buy it, in fairness,
and you forgot his birthday.
But you are a great mother.
Am I?
I watch those news stories about
kids gone missing and police hunts,
and I feel for those parents.
But sometimes, I wouldn't
mind that so much.
I wouldn't want anything bad to
happen to him, but sometimes,
I'd love to come home
and he just wasn't there.
Okay, I take it back.
You are a fucking
psycho. I gotta go.
See ya in Shifters later?
Have I ever said no
to that question?
See, there's something
to look forward to.
See ya, Flora.
That smoky voice... That is one, um, heck
of a... a little vehicle you have there.
You are sparkling like the
diamond we always knew you were.
Just watching you sell
the emotion of the song
is one of the most impressive things
I've seen since I've been judging.
Tremendous job.
Start your journey.
The fuck?
Hello, chaps.
Welcome, once again.
If you are a beginner guitarist,
there's a really high chance
that you are making one
of these five mistakes.
Then I had, you know,
a period of time
where I was just practicing that for
just a whole weekend, in my pajamas.
There's only one way to become
a Jeff Beck, a Jimmy Page.
Let me tell you.
This is how you might imagine a
typical guitar progress curve.
Once you've put in
your 10,000 hours,
you're officially a
professional guitarist.
- Oh, no.
- The three P's:
practice, practice, practice, practice.
So, let's go with the four P's.
I'm gonna teach you music
theory in ten minutes.
What up, YouTube? Your
boy, ZR, ready to teach you
how to shred the gnar on guitar.
Hi again. Miss Allison here.
- Now it's your turn!
- What are you wearing?
Well, let me tell you, you are
about to embark on a relationship
that will last you a lifetime.
One of joy and calm and peace.
A guitar is a lot
like a bicycle.
You put a little bit into it,
and you get a hell of a lot out.
But this is just by way of an
introduction to lessons with me.
Let's all just sit here and...
and think about that for a second.
About the potential that's already
there in the room with you right now.
If you wanna learn to play, just
hit that button there and sign up.
Bye.
Twenty fucking dollars?
Perfect. Perfect.

- Flying like eagles. And... Ah, shit!
- Shit...
Right, I'm going out.
To where? To that lot
you were with today?
No, just off to Rhys's house, then
over to the precinct for a bit.
You're not going to do some BASE
jumping off some buildings or something?
No. We don't have
a GoPro anyway.
'Cause the last thing I want
is the Guards calling here,
telling me you've fallen off
a tower block or something.
And you're dead. And gone.
Be back at 9:00!
- For what?
- Because I fucking say so.
I can't wait for the day
I don't have to be here.
The only reason you're here is
'cause your da wants his days off
for his projects.
Otherwise you'd be with
him 24-7, trust me.
If you don't want me here, why
do I have to be back at 9:00?
Don't play mind games
with me. Get out.
Hey, Flora, are
you my 12:00 p.m.?
Yeah.
How are you?
I'm all right. How are you?
Yeah, sun is shining
in Los Angeles.
I can smell the eucalyptus on the
breeze, so, uh, can't complain.
Yeah, lovely here in Dublin too.
Is it evening there?
No, it's just
permanently this grim.
So, you wanna learn the guitar.
Is it easy?
Uh, depends what you
wanna do with it.
Do you want to, uh, just
play for your own pleasure,
or you wanna play
for other people,
you wanna write songs on it
or learn your favorite songs?
What are you hoping
to get out of this?
I look at women playing the guitar
or the piano, and it's so sexy.
Wow. I guess that is why a lot
of people take up an instrument.
- Is that why you took it up?
- Uh, no.
No, you look pretty good.
Wouldn't say you need it.
- Okay.
- So why'd you start then?
Let's focus on you, all right?
Good plan.
Okay. So, let's sit it up there.
I'll teach you some root
chords. Let's start with G.
Ready?
- Brilliant.
- Okay.
So how many chords do you need to
know before you can write a song?
Uh, it's... it's...
it's not really, um...
about the number of chords.
It's more, you know,
how you use them.
- Mmm.
- Like, um... Here.
Okay. Same song.
Mm-hmm.
Jesus.
Yeah, so the first version,
it uses all the same,
you know, paints and
canvas and brushes.
But the second version has got 20
years of life and heartache on display.
You can see all
the brushstrokes.
All that personality's
in the same three chords.
And you can know
a thousand chords
and never write something
as beautiful as that.
Is that your problem?
I didn't know I had a problem.
You're teaching
guitar online, love.
- Right. You're Irish.
- So do you know a thousand chords?
What I'm saying is, we all
know the same number of words,
but we don't all write
a Shakespeare sonnet.
I'm confused.
Good. What are your
goals? Besides being sexy.
Impress people.
- Who?
- Men.
- Why?
- Sex and company.
Yeah, but what else?
To make them like me.
- Why don't they like you already?
- I don't know.
Maybe they can't see
your brushstrokes.
Are you coming on to me?
- Sorry?
- So you're a songwriter too?
- How do you know that?
- Google.
Took about six seconds.
Where do you live in LA?
I live in Topanga Canyon.
Oh, I heard of that. I bet you
drive a pickup and work with horses.
I do not work with horses.
What's your star sign?
- I don't know.
- You don't know your own birthday?
Let's get back to the
lesson, all right?
Let me ask you, do you consider
yourself a big music person?
I mean, I was always very
attracted to musicians.
I married one. He was on the
same bill as Snow Patrol once.
No, I'm asking, what are you doing here,
Flora, if music's not really your thing?
I liked the look of ya.
Okay.
All the other teachers seemed
like real posers and wankers,
you know, failed musicians.
But you seemed sorta...
real.
I am real.
You sorta calmed me down when
I saw you for the first time.
Your voice was all
soothing. Like a bath.
Right.
Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
- You might find it a little bit weird.
Could you play that same
song again, but this time...
with your shirt off?
Dear Jeff, I'm sorry for messing
around on our last lesson.
Suffice to say that
wine had been taken.
I do intend to learn the guitar and
take it seriously. Why? I don't know.
I was always the one in class
making fun of the teacher.
Because someone had to. But I
won't, if you'll keep teaching me.
Sorry I objectified ya.
I can send you a picture
of my amazing tits
to balance things out
again, if you'd like? Flora.
Right, now... let's get
that shite off your arse.
Ready?
- What is that?
- Shh.
- What are you doing though? It's annoying.
- Shut up!
Fucking woman.
Fuck.
- Right, I'm going out.
- Oh, good.
I mean, where?
Just around.
You gonna be hanging out with
that girl I've seen you with?
The one dressed up like a
prostitute in your man's video?
Samantha? Don't know,
she could be there.
What's she like?
Don't know. Don't really
care. Right, back at 9:00.
Or 10:00!
If you like.
Hiya.
Can't believe you
got back to me.
Well, you're a challenge. I like a
challenge. Should we get started?
Let's rock.
All right. Flora, let's get
to know you a bit better.
What is your all-time
favorite song?
Uh...
I'm more into dance music. Uh...
Oh, "You're Beautiful"
by James Blunt.
Okay, we're gonna
have a problem.
- Why?
- That's not an acceptable song.
It's catchy.
So was cholera.
I don't know that one.
If you're gonna be
learning to play songs,
we're just gonna need to
raise the bar a little bit.
- What have you written then?
- I'm a teacher.
Exactly. So shut up
criticizing Blunt.
- You do it.
- Do what?
Write a song that reaches millions of
people's hearts and makes them weep.
Making people cry is not an
achievement. Bullies do it every day.
Let's hear one of
your songs then.
Lyrics need to be more than
just "you're beautiful"
or some series of
platitudes for lonely women,
trying to make 'em feel
better about themselves.
That's not a love song.
That's a self-help group.
You don't know the first thing
about women if you think that.
I know that grown-ups don't want
to be told how pretty they are
like some creep trying
to pick 'em up at a bar.
Jesus Christ, it's
just a bloody song.
No. It is never just a song.
It is a three-and-a-half-minute
pause in time
in which to do something wonderful,
something touched by God.
Oh, no. Are you some sort of
Christian evangelist dude?
♪ I get along without you ♪
♪ Very well ♪
♪ Of course, I do ♪
♪ Except when soft rains fall ♪

♪ Of course, I do ♪
♪ But I get along without you ♪
♪ Very well ♪
- Jesus Christ.
- Right?
- That's unbelievable.
- So simple, so direct.
Nothing about beauty.
You are a genius.
Uh... So you really like it?
It's stunning. You've got to
get that out there in the world.
You think that would sell as
much as, uh, "You're Beautiful"?
Maybe not as much as that. I mean, I still
like the other song too. Is that allowed?
No, that's...
Stockholm syndrome.
We're gonna "de-brainwash" you.
By the time we're finished here,
you're not gonna have time for
these childish jingles and clichés.
- I'm exhausted.
- Well, we're just getting started.
You wanna learn the chords to
that song so you can play it?
- Yeah.
- All right. Starts with C.
So, your ring finger,
here on the fifth string.
Right there at that dot. Yep.
You have lovely long fingers.
Mine are quite stubby.
Your fingers don't matter. Django
Reinhardt was missing two fingers.
- Oh, wow. I love him.
- Uh-huh.
So, the middle finger there,
then your pointer's way up here.
- Mmm.
- Yep. Yep.
- There. And there?
- There you go. One up. Strum that.
Yeah! Yeah.
Whoo!
- Feels good, right?
- Yeah, baby!
Sorry.
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing. I love this.
You're a quick learner.
- I knew I'd be good at this.
- Mm-hmm.
Let's move on.
What else you got?
Well, next would be G and then F,
but let's stick for a second on C.
Okay, let's.
You are now the proud
owner of C, right?
And you didn't own
that five minutes ago.
You're rich. You own
something Elvis owned.
- Mmm. I'd rather have his plane.
- Plus, it didn't cost you anything.
Well, $20 for this class, but
I do know what you mean. Go on.
You own something new, and
nobody can take it away from you.
And this isn't just
some must-have object.
It's not a bag or
a car or a phone.
You ever seen an ad for a
guitar? No, it sells itself.
This is a gift you can take to your grave,
and you can use it whenever you want.
And in the right context,
it can speak directly to your heart
in ways we don't even understand.
More than thoughts, more
than words, more than ideas.
Just a chord, hanging
there in the air.
C.
♪ Woken up by the birds ♪

- Can anyone sign up?
- For sure, yeah. That's the idea.
Just keeping the music local.
What's the cash prize?
Eighty percent of the door.
There's usually about 50 punters.
- How much a head?
- Fiver.
Jesus, that's pricey enough.
Are they all that shit?
It's not about that. It's about keeping
music alive in the neighborhood.
That's all I'm about.
So who decides who wins?
I do. Barry Byrne.
Events promoter.
I know who you are, Barry.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, Jesus. How are ya?
Don't tell me. Fiona.
- Flora.
- Ah.
Knew you were in the F's.
Better go in. Good
to see you again.
In the daylight.
I bet she wins!
Singing...
You look very young.
I was very young.
How much do you think
that cost to shoot that?
- No clue.
- Two grand we got
from the record label for it.
We had a crane for every
shot in this. Every shot.
- Did you have a trailer?
- No, but we had a fucking crane.
So, did you go to
America for that?
- Looks like it, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
No, we fucking shot it
all around Drimnagh.
Why is there a
cop in every shot?
'Cause... it's
America, you know.
- There's that same cop again.
- Fucking pay attention, will you?
There's Ma. See ya, Da.
What's that?
What's what? Oh,
it's just me guitar.
I have a lesson later. I
thought I'd do it in the park.
What's this all about, Flora?
- What's what about?
- This whole fucking musical thing.
Anytime I tried to get ya to listen to
new music, you just fucking tuned out.
Yeah, my tutor says I have
"genuine appreciation of melody."
Now.
What do you listen to then?
Apart from club music.
Give me five bands. Go on.
Well, I like his songs anyway.
Oh, he's a songwriter
too, is he?
Yeah, he is. He's
brilliant actually.
What's his name?
Jeff...
the guitar guy.
Sounds like some fucking
clown who never made it,
teaching guitar lessons online.
That's the ultimate graveyard
for failed musicians.
Are you a little bit jealous?
No. Just concerned.
- How's Juanita?
- She's great.
Mmm. You do know she's
not Spanish, right?
Her nana's people
were from Spain.
My people were from Norway. That
doesn't make me a fucking Viking.
Does she blow you like I did?
What? Shut up.
I'm serious. Does she?
You're nuts.
She doesn't blow you, does she?
- Yeah, she does. She...
- She has. Yeah.
She doesn't. I knew it.
Her mouth's too small.
Is she out? Will I come
up for a few minutes?
We'll send Max off
for an ice cream.
Don't be fucking mad.
I bet she doesn't let you come all
down her neck and tits the way I did.
Come on, Max!
Are you getting
rid of that guitar?
This? No, why?
- Wake up, will you!
- Jesus.
Fuck off!
You stepped right in front of me.
Will you watch where you're going?
You watch where you're going or I'll
wrap that fucking lock around your neck!
What are you doing with it then?
It was just sitting there. Why?
Do you want it? You can have it.
I don't. I don't like
acoustic guitar music anyway.
What are you into then?
Ambient. Electronic.
I always loved dance music.
Like what?
Container. Sophie is amazing.
Orbital, back in the day.
- Who the fuck are they?
- Dance music.
What are you into then?
Marconi Union.
Do you know them?
No.
They're from Manchester, I
think. Real trance music.
It sounds like a computer
made it. It's deadly.
I have some on me phone if
you want to listen to them.
What, now?
- Whenever...
- Right, you've got your key.
There's waffles in the
fridge. I'm heading out.
- Bye.
- I'll be back in an hour and a half!
I don't care.
So, am I ready?
For what?
To write a female empowerment
ballad and get me husband back.
Why did he leave?
Anger?
Why is he angry?
No, me. I'm angry. I almost killed
a cyclist today with his own lock.
What are you angry about?
Dunno. I wake up angry.
I'm angry at me
son all the time.
I thought this guitar lark
might make him think I'm cool.
Hold on. You have a son?
I had him when I was very young.
I was 17. Do you have kids?
I do. I actually had them kinda
young too, so they're huge now.
But they do think I'm cool.
Play me your song again.
Yeah, I wanted to bring that up.
So that wasn't my song.
What? Whose is it?
It was written by
Hoagy Carmichael.
Oh, love. Why'd you tell
me it was your song?
Well, I didn't.
Uh, you presumed.
But then I let you. So, sorry.
Why?
I guess I wanted
to see how it felt.
To what?
To have written a song like
that, in someone else's eyes.
Yeah, uh, stupid. I apologize.
Let's get back to the lesson.
Why? What normally happens?
Oh, you wanna hear
one of my songs?
- Yeah.
- All right.

you through the canyon ♪

It's lovely. You're
really good at songs.
But?
Would I wanna hear it again?
Sorry.
No, no. Don't be sorry. If
everybody were as honest as you,
I wouldn't have had to waste a
decade and a half of my life.
We should, uh, get
back to the lesson.
Don't feel sorry for yourself.
No, no. I'm not. I mean, it's...
it's a humbling realization.
You know, you sit down and wanna play
something for somebody, and they're ready.
You're, like, receptive.
And you watch as
their eyes glaze over.
And, um, it's harder for
them than it is for you.
It's the smiling with the mouth but
not the eyes. That's how you know.
Know what?
That they're unchanged.
Anyway. A, D and
E. One, four, five.
Come on.
You know what, I'm, uh... I'm gonna
give you some homework tonight.
There's a song I want
you to listen to.
I'll send you a link.
Give it a listen.
Play. Come on.

Can I meet him? I mean, see him.
- No.
- Please.
I'll just stand in the corner of the
room. I'll be like a little mouse.
That'd be so wrong.
Is he good-looking? Do
you have a screen grab?
- It's not about that.
- So he's a pig then.
He never says what
you expect him to say.
And he's sensitive. You can
see in his eyes he's been hurt.
Ugh.
What are his songs like?
Uh, not great.
Oh, Jesus. You've fallen in love with an
ugly fella who lives 6,000 miles away.
Basically.
And we'll fuck behind the dunes.
Fucking hell! Jesus Christ,
it's like a club in here!
Turn it down a second!
Jesus, that's loud.
Yeah, Keith lent them to me.
Really powerful. Have to
give them back tomorrow.
The neighbors will
be complaining.
They're junkies. They'll
be asking to turn it up.
Who's Keith?
He's a mate. A rapper. He
lent me these for the night.
- For what?
- So I could mix this track.
Was that yours?
You're joking me. How the fuck did
you make that? It sounded epic.
GarageBand. It's simple.
Explain.
Um, you get all your sounds from
here, like, instruments and all.
- And you can get loops from here.
- What are loops?
Drum patterns and stuff. I
mean, you can make your own.
But you need a proper
sequencer for that.
And how do you control them? Like,
how do you get that mad piano sound?
Well, you open the
"Keyboard typing," you know,
use the laptop keys.
No way.
Sounds like a piano.
Oh, shit.
Not on me track. Turn it off.
Jesus, it sounds
very professional.
It is. It's what loads of people start
on. It's shit doing it like this though.
You need a proper synth. Takes
forever doing one note at a time.
I've been at this for three hours
today. I'm fucking starving.
Play it again.
Please just make me
a cheese toastie.
Please.
After.
Do you have a lyric?
- Got these, but they're not finished yet.

Can you fucking play or what?
I'm not playing for you.
Go on, give us a
tune on that guitar.
- Come on.
- No.
It's not that big of a fucking
deal. Would you just play one song?
Okay.
Ian. Why are you
doing this to me?
Come on, you'll be great.
I can play you a song I wrote.
- Okay, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?
Oh, my God. Okay.
Yeah.

That's the look.
Yeah, for turtles.
Come on, let's go!
- Yeah. See that?
- Oh, yeah?
You're making progress. Your
left hand's getting stronger.
Thank you.
I've been thinking
about your song.
Okay.
I think it's salvageable.
Good to know.
The problem is that you
have a great opening verse.
But the chorus
isn't a lot better.
Now, in my research, I find that choruses
used to be the big deal in a song.
You know, what everyone
was waiting for.
But, nowadays, it's not like,
"Here comes the chorus, everyone."
You know, 'cause unless you have
a killer chorus, which you don't,
it's an anticlimax.
So, what you're saying
is, my verse is too good?
Wow. You are a
glass-half-full kind of guy.
I guess that's one
way of looking at it.
You play the first
verse and sing it,
and then play it again, and
I'll hum what I mean. Ready?
- What, now?
- Yeah.
What about the lesson?
This is the lesson. Go.
Okay. So, you want me to play...

Yeah, I'll email them. You

I'll, uh... I'll
give 'em a shot.
I'll try to fold them in.
I can't promise it'll work.
Okay. Whatever. Can I get 10%?
You can get 100%. I stopped trying
to make money with my music.
I tried that for years. It
almost killed the thing I love.

Yeah.

No way.

- Jesus Christ.
Are you Cheryl's daughter?
Hiya, Flora.
Jesus, you've shot up.
Stop, I know. Taller
than me mother now.
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's grand.
Talks about you all the
time. The crack youse had.
Don't talk to me!
Do you wanna come up for a

When you wrap?
Ah. No, you're grand.
Come on. Come up for
some garlic bread.
Nah. No, thanks.
Right. Okay. See ya.
See ya.
What are you doing right now?
You don't want to know.
Tell me what you feel about her.
I can't stop thinking of her.
Good. Obsession.
You're obsessed.
I suppose.
I was obsessed with your da.
I don't care.
So go on.
She's totally out of me league.
No, she's not.
Yeah, she is. She
gets off with Keith.
She thinks that Keith
can offer her something.
He's all glamorous and dangerous
with the 1,000-euro jackets.
She needs to know that when she's done
with her gangster, you'll be there.
- That's you. The red.
- Hmm.
If we had an
external microphone,
- the quality would be much better.
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to put reverb on?
- Yeah, can you?
Yeah.
That's cool. Do it
better and I'll loop it.
Right. Write these down.

Yeah.

So now it just needs
a killer bridge.
What's a bridge?
A bridge is a change for eight
bars after the second chorus.
Okay.
- It sounds amazing.
- It's better, right?
Yeah. It actually works.
I really struggled
with that song.
It's very intimate, isn't it?
Singing together like that.
It's a bit like, uh...
we've just made
love or something.
- No, it's not like that.
- In a way though.
I do feel a little
bit naked right now.
I think music is
all about romance.
I mean, look at A Star is Born.
Not if I don't have to.
How come the way things are
are never enough for you?
They never were. I was
always pushing things.
- Finding ways of getting outside meself.
- Like how?
Like...
leaving school
before everyone else.
And then getting pregnant
and not getting an abortion
when everyone was telling me to.
I thought getting pregnant
might make me feel different.
I thought giving
birth, I'd be reborn.
Then I was stoned during
most of his childhood.
I was drunk for the
birth of both my kids.
Like in a bar?
- Like in the delivery room.
- Oh, wow.
That's hard-core. Bet
your wife loved that.
Right? She's the one pushing a
nine-pound human through her vagina,
and I'm the one that's breaking.
Never admitted that
to anybody before.
I was drunk the whole... whole
first ten years of their lives.
What got you clean?
Well, having kids started
it, and AA kept me off.
And, uh, really just
learning to put them first.
- Is that the dawn behind you?
- Christ, it is.
- Is that the sunset behind you?
- Uh-huh.
We've been up all night.
So, this is like,
uh, pillow talk?
No, no, you owe
me for six hours.
I do not.
No, I like talking to you.
I don't know why, 'cause
nothing you say makes any sense.
Is that all?
Nothing's ever enough
for you, is it?
Are you saying you don't find
me a teeny bit attractive
- when I'm singing that song with you?
- You're my student.
- So?
- It's inappropriate.
Who's going to cancel you?
You're already no one.
I don't think I could start
something with somebody
halfway across the
planet, through a screen.
My heart couldn't take it.
I'm not 19.
Life's lonely enough as it is.
I could get a plane.
So could I.
Well, then we'd miss each other.
You're not coming here.
It would be like walking
into a live soap opera.
Plus, I wanna see LA.
This isn't all about you.
I could play our song for
some friends in the business.
Ten percent.
I'd pick you up at the airport.
You'd better.
Oh, get yourself over here then.
So, what's so important it couldn't
wait till we swap him over?
Sit down. Relax.
- Want a glass of wine?
- Wine, Flora?
At ten o'clock in
the morning? No.
Few gurgles during the day.
How would you feel about
looking after Max for a bit?
While I sorta found meself.
I didn't know you were lost.
Yeah, well, I haven't left
Dublin in, like, ten years.
Where you thinking of
going? Cork? Galway?
Yeah. Or LA, or...
What? Could you pick
somewhere further away?
That's sort of the point.
Oh. Oh, I see.
This is about the fucking
guitar guy, is it? Jeff.
I don't even know if he lives
in LA. This is about me.
Look, it doesn't matter.
Can't be looking after Max.
You couldn't have picked
a worse fucking time.
Why?
I'm starting up a wedding band
with the lads outta Indigo Void.
Imagine this now, all right, me and
the lads all in tuxes, shades on.
A whole fucking Rat Pack,
Tarantino vibe. Fucking savage.
The beach is down the
road from his house.
And it's constantly sunny.
And he has a pool in his
yard that he put in himself.
Imagine Ian doing that.
He'd fucking drown.
Do you know it's been 12 years
since I had a bathing suit on?
You lucky bitch. Can I come?
And if things don't
work out, that's fine.
I just come home, right?
But I get to say I
did something brave.
For once in me life.
Something about me.
Hasn't most of your life
been a little bit about you?
- What are you talking about?
- Uh, nothing.
I'm just saying, like, you've
always followed your own thing.
Are you for me or against me?
Look, I'm totally into you
going to LA to fuck this guy.
Maybe get your song heard by
a couple of friends of his.
Totally into that story.
But last time I checked, miners
and frontline workers were brave.
Speaking of brave...
would you look
after Max for a bit?
Excuse me?
You've known him his
whole life. He trusts you.
Plus, you have that spare room
since your brother moved out.
- It's only for a month or so.
- No, I can't.
- I wouldn't ask just anyone.
- Yeah, you would.
What do you mean by that?
I have a job. I live with
me mam. I have Shania.
Much and all as I love you,
I can't be looking after
your nutter son as well.
I've never asked you to
do anything with Max.
Yeah, but I was there
for if you needed me to.
That's not good enough.
You never offered.
Everyone says they care.
Every bloke I've met is
all, "Ah, you have a kid.
Deadly. Let's give it a go.
I'll rise to the occasion."
And then they fucking disappear.
And all me so-called mates are
like, "Aw, you and Max are so cute."
But then they're off to
Spain on their holidays,
and "they don't take
kids at this resort."
Or ask them to fucking
do something for you,
and they're nowhere to be found.
They never babysat. They never
picked him up from school.
They never asked me what I
might want or what my needs are.
Since I was 17, with a
screaming child on me lap,
doing me head in, while youse were
all living your fucking lives.
Now I want to live my life!
Should have thought about that
14 years ago, shouldn't you?
Do you think I
wanted that child?
We were all fucking like
rabbits. So I don't know.
Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't.
But you didn't get the
boat to London, did you?
That was your call. Now don't be asking
other people to pick up the pieces.
Hey! Hey!
Stop him!
- Hello?
- Flora, it's Guard O'Connelly here.
We have Max again at the
station. Can you come down?
Ah, for fuck's sake.
Right.
So young Max here stole an
expensive piece of studio equipment
from a shop on Wicklow Street,
causing the shop owner to give chase.
- How expensive was it?
- That's not the point.
He's way past the number
of thefts and charges
where we can keep him out of court and
very likely a correctional facility.
- Are you joking me?
- No.
Guard, there's gotta be
some way to fix this.
- You're all he's got.
- No, Flora, I'm done with him.
He's been robbing since
he's been in short trousers.
He's a waste of space.
There's a time when you run out
of road, and it's that time.
Like I said, I've
tried everything.
And so have you, Flora.
Good luck, kid.
Lads, get that fella
up from the cell there.
I want him in
Interview Two, yeah?
A fucking 400-euro synthesizer?
- I told you I needed the right gear.
- For what?
To rerecord that song.
It sounded rubbish.
Who are you, fucking Drake? It's
just a bleeding song on your laptop.
Did you not send her your video?
Yeah, I did. She hated it. She
thought it was real creepy.
Well, fuck her then.
It's all your fault.
Getting me to stare into
the camera all intense.
In me shorts, like a weirdo.
She doesn't want to see that.
Oh, what does she
want to see then?
You wouldn't understand.
I want to do it right.
Well, I'm sure she'll give you loads
of attention when you're behind bars.
Women love criminals.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What movie are you in?
One without you in it. I
mean, what do you care?
You'll be in LA
with your boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.
Anyway, how do you
know about that?
We live in a fucking shoebox.
I'll be grand with that.
You know, just get
out of me way, woman.
Gladly!
I've just come from his
free legal aid lawyer.
They say he's defo
gonna serve some time.
Little fucking bollocks. He's
been given so many chances.
I know. Do you wanna let
on we're still together?
When we stand up in
court. Judges like that.
Yeah.
Flora, look... Those
places get a bad rep,
but they're not what they
used to be, you know.
They're more like a school
now than a detention center.
They've got football pitches
in them. Art shit. Wi-Fi.
They're very fucking
progressive, you know.
It might be the
best thing for him.
Just having to man up, you
know, look out for himself.
Make friends. Negotiate.
People skills.
He's just been sitting around
on his hole doing nothing.
But this would give us the
time we were talking about.
For your dreams and
my various projects.
We've been doing nothing but
parenting him for the last 14 years.
How's he gonna have
any respect for us
if we're just waiting
around on him all the time?
He needs to know who I am.
And he needs to know
who you are, Flora.
I'll see you in
court on Tuesday.
This way.
Can you see me? I don't
think you fucking care.
Could you hurry up, please?
Thank you very fucking
much for your time.
Treating us like criminals.
Following us out. Do you mind?
I'll tell you something. She
better not come in here...
- Did you text him?
- Yeah, twice.
I'll text him again.
Pick up your phone,
you fucking asshole.
This is the one thing
you need to be at,
and you're sitting on your
arse playing video games.
I've been texting you all
morning, you fucking asshole.
Get over here.
This case is now adjourned.
Next case on the ballot
is the state versus...
Can the defendant
please step forward?
Next case on the
ballot is Max Mulvey.
Any previous offenses?
Six.
Max is an excellent student
when he applies himself.
There's been drug use
with both his parents.
His father is a musician,
uh, but the band split up
and he's... he's
struggled ever since.
His mother, uh... has been
holding down various jobs as a...
a mother's helper.
Commutes an hour a day.
He excels in... in music...
I presume you're the
defendant's mother?
Yes, Judge.
Um, his father was supposed
to be here as well,
but he couldn't get out of work.
He lives with you both?
Yes, we both live with
him. Uh, at two houses.
- We both take care of him.
- I asked where Max lived.
Yes, Judge, uh, he
lives with both of us.
But at two houses,
mine and me husband's.
It seems to me a couple of months
in a strict supervision environment
might teach you to respect the
efforts your parents have made.
I'm going to impose an eight-week
sentence on you, Mr. Mulvey,
in a juvenile correctional
facility, and one year's probation.
I hope you learn
your lesson in there,
and that I won't be seeing
you again in my courtroom.
- I don't care.
- Good man.
That's very harsh.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.
Are you a mother?
- Completely irrelevant.
- Right.
But I believe if I weren't, I would
have imposed a harsher sentence.
If the shop owner
has his gear back,
- what's the point in sending him in there?
- Madam...
I'll do whatever it
takes to figure this out.
And what would that be?
I have 500 euros put away. I
can give it to the shop owner.
And if he's satisfied with that,
then he might drop the charges.
Otherwise, what's the point in sending
him in there and breaking up me family?
Without him, I have nothing.
The owner isn't here.
And this is a legal matter,
not a financial one.
Max has been on the liaison
program for half his life.
I'd be making a mockery of it if I
didn't impose a custodial sentence.
But in the light of your
efforts, I'll reduce it.
Four weeks and a
year's probation.
- You did brilliant.
- No, I didn't.
- I'll be grand in there.
- No, you won't.
I will now, Ma.
Thanks, Ma.
Okay, Son.
You're okay.
So, I'm not coming to visit you.
When he gets out I might come,
but I'd have to bring him.
How annoying is he?
Very annoying.
Yeah.
Oh, shit. I'm not gonna be
able to play you my song.
Which song?
The song I wrote about you.
- You wrote a song about me?
- Yeah.
It's about, you know,
your soul and the time
we've spent and who you are.
What's it called?
"Crazy Irish Bitch."
I haven't written a new
song in a long time.
I just didn't feel like I had
much to write about in life,
but, uh, I did, I
guess. So thanks.
You're welcome.
So I'm your muse?
Yeah.
Although nowadays you're supposed
to be offended by that, right?
Fuck that. Feels
great. I wanna hear it.
I'll record it for you.
Hi, Judge. Do you have a second?
I'm the mad one from
court the other week.
I know who you are. What is it?
Would you just make one small
change to your sentence?
It's just a detail, but you
could help make it happen.
What is it?
Would you let him bring
his music stuff with him?
The info pack says
there's no personal items,
but he has his headphones
and a microphone.
I think it will be very good for
him to continue with his music,
especially with all
this time on his hands.
I don't see why I
couldn't look into that.
- That's the one you want?
- Yeah.
That's the one Keith
has. It's class.
And that's a good microphone?
Yeah, it's very good
for GarageBand and that.
It's an all-round good mic.
Thanks very much.
Little prick.
Here, Ma. Check this out
It's just a rough vocal.

Sorry, you're telling me that
the day you did the very thing
that you got locked up for
- was the best day of your life?
- Yeah, hands down.
I felt like I was on fire
meself. I felt alive that day.
Well, the best day of my life is
the day I get out of this kip.
Yeah, but that's in the future.
I'm talking about up to now.
Well, I haven't had
a good day, have I?
What about you, Max?
Best day of my life was the
day I made a video with me ma.
You made a video
with your mother?
- Yeah.
- Well, can we see it?
No.
All right, but that's your day?
Yeah, that was a good day.
Okay, I'm gonna have to
park this thing properly.
So I'll see youse inside,
all right? Good luck.
- Get up with us.
- No, no.
- I'll be at the bar.
- Come on.
Come on. It'll be great.
Look, no offense, but I'm actually
a professional bass player,
so I'm not gonna be playing some
random amateur night. Thanks.
Hey, Da. You weren't at the
court. You have to do this.
I don't even have me bass.
I packed it. It's
in the back seat.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
You're not getting

Is that the name

Flora and Son.

Hiya. Um, this is Jeff.
He's in LA. Say hello, Jeff.
Hello, Dublin.
Always wanted to say that.
And, um, this is Ian on bass.
And Max, me son, on keyboards.
Um, we wrote this song together.
Jeff helped. And Ian, sorta.
Um, but, uh, we thought we'd, uh, try it
live for you, if-if-if that's all right.
Okay. I've never
done this before.
I've had diarrhea all
week leading up to this.
Don't be nervous.
It's easy for you to say.
This is a Dublin crowd.
They'll savage me
if I fuck it up.
Okay, you ready?
