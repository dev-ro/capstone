Mrs. Stevenson, how do you feel about
the disappearance of your husband in the jungle?
Leave her alone, my sister
is very tired.
It's true that the expedition
was not authorized?
Will you set up a rescue mission?
Do you think you'll find him alive?
Do you have anything to say to the press?
No, no statements.
All efforts of the search party
to find him in the Marabata jungle
were in vain and we have decided
to call up the search.
I'm sorry.
Your husband's expedition,
as the chief of police has
already told was not authorized by the authorities
of the independent Guinea.
Therefore, they had no kind of
contact with him, not even by radio.
Your husband was carrying out ethnological
studies without our knowledge or permission.
When your brother informed us of
Mr. Stevenson's disappearance, we intervened.
If our search was a bit tardy,
that's not our fault.
I waited here, at Port Moresby
one month or more, until the
established date for him to return.
Also, as you know, my brother-in-law
had a profound knowledge of that area.
So I had no real motive
to be worried about it.
You can never know the jungle
well enough.
This clandestine expedition
was imprudent
apart from being an insult
to our government.
My brother-in-law is a world famous scientist.
I think your government should take
special interest in locating his expedition.
Air search parties have been out.
Looking for
signs of life in the
jungle for several days.
If they were perhaps still alive, they'd have
surely attempted some signal.
Maybe they were there. The jungle is so
dense there is no chance to see anything.
We have to organize an expedition
into the jungle.
Look, please keep calm.
We have every intention of helping you
to find Mr. Stevenson.
But now, it is up to the local authorities
to organize help and make all decisions.
We have done all we can.
Please help me.
I don't know if he's still alive.
But until I'm certain of his state,
I will keep on looking for him
If necessary, I'll do it alone.
I understand how you feel, but it is
my duty to be honest.
If we have given up, that
is because we are certain
that after three months in that jungle
there could not possibly be any survivors.
I'm sorry, Consul Burns,
but I have to leave.
Of course. And thank you.
- Sir, Mrs. Stevenson.
I think the only person who can help you
is Professor Edward Foster.
He is a strange man,
and he has an expert knowledge of the area.
I suggest you contact him.
Arthur has already been in touch with him.
We'll see him tomorrow.
Hello.
Mrs. Stevenson?
I'm Edward Foster.
I'm glad to meet you.
Arthur.
Hello, Edward.
You're looking well.
So are you.
Please.
You must excuse the informality of my house.
Mother nature has a way of taking over here
and I don't feel that I can deal with it.
Henry often mentioned you
in his letters.
He had great respect.
We're glad to meet you.
Likewise..
Your husband and I are very close friends.
We share a mutual interest
for primitive peoples of this country.
Of course, that world is rapidly disappearing.
Eventually, progress and technology
will destroy it.
Tell me.
Do you have any idea
where Henry could be?
I'm not sure.
He was very reserved
about this particular expedition.
Strange.
He told me he was going.
I offered my help...
but before I knew it, he was gone.
As far as I know, he left alone.
Maybe a few natives.
I just cannot understand why he was so secretive
about this expedition.
Especially with you.
Yeah, I thought about that myself.
But you know, just because it was
so secretive about this journey...
gives me strong indication
just where it might be.
Come.
This is the Marabata jungle,
the area where they say he disappeared.
Look, about 5 miles offshore is the island of Roka.
This island is covered
by a very dense jungle,
which surrounds and protects
the sacred mountain Ra-Rami ..
Sacred, because local people and the natives
believe that the mountain is cursed.
And that's where they went!
And you kept quiet about this all this time?
What are you talking about?
Arthur...
Please, go on.
Mrs. Stevenson...
There's something I think you should know.
A few years ago,
I was on that island myself.
Shortly after, I told Arthur and Henry,
about my experiences there.
Henry seemed fascinated by that.
Yes... I think I remember now.
Henry told me
in one of his letters,
about a mountain, about people
said there was a curse on it.
I thought it was just a silly superstition.
You'd be surprised how important
that belief is for those people.
The police won't allow expeditions
into the Marabata jungle.
They don't want anybody knew that...
They say it is
for conservation reasons.
But the truth of the matter is,
they are afraid of the curse, too.
Just like everybody else.
How did you manage to go there?
It's a long story, Mrs. Stevenson.
It is purely by chance, in fact.
I was on a sailing trip,
not far from the coast of the island.
I hit a storm, before I knew,
I was shipwrecked on the beach.
Because I knew about the legend of the curse,
naturally, I was curious.
I wanted to get to
the top of that mountain.
I never made it.
What stopped you?
Some...
mysterious force,
that's about all I can say.
Come on! Do you still believe in that nonsense?
Yes.
Are you really convinced that Henry
has gone to that mountain?
I think there's a good chance.
One thing for sure.
He didn't get lost in the Marabata.
He knew that jungle too well.
I would like you to organize
an expedition to the island of Roka.
Arthur and myself will come with you.
Are you serious?
Yes.
It's hard for a man, but
for a woman would be nearly impossible.
My husband is missing.
I'm prepared to do anything
to find him.
I also have the courage to take
such a trip.
And the money, as well.
I'll leave you down there.
I can't go any further than that.
Now, I have to make radio
contact for the flight route.
I wish I could take you further.
You saved us
a whole month of walking through the jungle.
We should be on the coast
for about a week.
Thank you for your knowledge.
OK, we're going down.
Thanks, Phil!
Let's go, hurry!
Remember, don't say a word to anybody. We don't want
the police on our tail.
Don't worry. Good luck.
You'll need it.
Why does he look at me
in a strange way? I don't like it.
Don't worry, he is just shy.
He is very faithful to me.
Look, I am afraid we have to carry our own
luggage just for a few miles.
We'll pick up some extra help from the local natives
between here and the coast.
Ready?
Hey, let's go.
You alright?
Spider.
Did it bite you?
No.
You're very lucky, you know that?
It's extremely poisonous.
First you get a fever,
that lasts about 3 days and then you die.
So from now on, I suggest you
watch where you are going.
And always keep someone behind you.
You lead the expedition.
How was I to know?
You do now.
The natives believe that killing a spider
is a bad omen.
They are going to make a sacrifice.
It sickens me.
I know.
It's a ritual.
They offer the iguana to their gods
to protect us from the forces of evil.
For me it is repulsive.
It's part of their religion.
We better hide!
Get under cover!
Move! Move!
That's enough! Damn it. Now the police
know where we are, stupid...
Edward!
My god.
Satisfied now?
You better have a nice, long talk with your brother
before he causes anymore trouble.
Don't try to put her against me.
Don't try to break this expedition.
I won't let you.
We'll reach the mountain.
We'll reach it together.
The three of us.
Well, then, you care to join me?
I suggest we keep going.
We may reach the coast by tomorrow night,
if we're lucky.
Roka is just over there.
We gotta stay in the cover while we prepare the
boat.
When do we leave?
Tonight.
We'll be there before dawn.
Currents will help us across.
Take cover!
Be careful.
Don't trust him too much.
We leave the boat here until we see the terrain.
It should be alright.
Over there!
Come on!
There is something else!
We may not be alone.
There could be other bodies,
we'll have a look around.
He was a leper.
Natives believe the lepers
are the children of the devil.
Maybe killed him.
Come over here.
It's Henry's!
See, he has his mark.
I gave it to him a few years ago.
Then I was right,
he did come this way.
He must have gone to the mountain.
Let's look for it.
Arthur, that way. You come with me.
You go there.
You follow me.
We didn't find anything.
Nothing.
Deflate the boat and hide it.
Let's hope we find it when we come back.
What is it?
I don't know.
I thought I heard something,
I guess I was wrong.
They said they woke up at dawn,
they said he wasn't here.
He ran away, the bastard.
No, Asaro wouldn't runaway.
Besides, where would he go?
He might have taken the boat.
But the beach is too far.
He was scared.
Yes, but he's not a coward.
He knows the jungle too well and
he would never travel alone, especially at night.
Then where is he?
I don't know.
Well, now we are one man short.
It's not gonna be easy without him.
Maybe we should turn back.
We got the compass.
And it is in all our interest,
to reach the mountain.
Especially yours.
What do you mean?
I mean it is not just
finding a friend
also to climb that mountain!
Is it?
Arthur!
Edward!
Are you hiding something from me?
Your brother is a complete neurotic.
Even your husband didn't want him next to him,
because he couldn't trust him.
I didn't trust you very much either.
Enough! Stop!
Don't you two realize?
I want to find my husband, both.
That's why we're going to that mountain.
Susan is right.
We all want it only to find Henry.
Alright. But I don't want
to hear anymore insinuation.
You understand?
Let's break camp.
Bamboo.
We must be near the water.
This way!
Right on target!
The mountain is across the river.
We have to build a raft.
Are you looking for this?
It's wet, but it still works.
Cake?
Animal traps.
It was for us.
Maybe.
We better move quickly.
Take only the water and what we absolutely need.
Here.
Take this.
Let's move.
Edward! Look, he's running away!
Wait!
Susan...
Edward!
Hold it!
No, wait.
She was attacked by a native.
She'll be alright.
My name is Manolo.
This is Father Moses's mission.
I brought you
some white sinners, Moses.
They need food, water
and a place to sleep.
Edward!
Hello, Father!
You haven't changed a bit!
Coming back like this after so long!
I am so pleased.
What brings you here?
I just couldn't stay away.
Vancho! Come.
Look who's here.
Hello, Vancho.
This is Sura, Vancho's new wife.
Moses, I have two other people, as well.
Father, I'd like you to meet Mrs. Stevenson
and her brother, Arthur Weisser.
Hello, Father.
It's nice to be here.
Pleased to meet you.
May I ask what you're doing here?
We're on our way to the Mountain Ra-Rami.
To the mountain! Are you crazy?
You will not never get though the jungle
which surrounds him, dear.
We have to. I'm looking for my husband.
He's lost with his expedition.
Come.
I don't believe you, Manolo.
Aborigines are not hostile.
It's impossible.
From what I managed to make out
in those few moments, he was different.
He was wearing a mask and his body
it was painted white.
I've never seen his kind before. Never.
Was he wearing a small bone on his arm?
Edward... you're crazy.
Yes, I think I do remember...
that he had something tied to his arm.
But I am not sure what...
He was a member of a tribe called Puka.
The Puka? Puka, they've been extinct
for years! It cannot be them.
Father.
Six years ago, when I first met you
when I came to this island...
You never knew what happened to me
after I left here.
I was captured by the Puka.
You always had a wonderful imagination!
I would it were
my imagination, father.
When I was first taken prisoner by them
they wanted to kill me.
But the chief's son was sick, he had fever.
I had quinine with me and I
take care of him until he got better.
After that...
They treated me as one of theirs.
But I still tried to escape.
I tried and tried, three or four times,
but I never succeeded.
So how did you manage to getaway?
One day, an enemy tribe
attacked our village.
There was fighting everywhere, chaos, fire.
I saw my chance, and I ran away.
I ran, and I ran.
Finally I got to the beach.
A fishing boat saw me
and I returned to civilization.
You still don't believe me, do you?
No, carajo.
It's all nonsense.
They no longer exist.
You may be right, Father.
I hope they are all dead. I really do.
Why is everybody so scared by the Puka?
They were the ancient inhabitants of Ra-Rami.
Susan...
In their language, Ra-Rami means,
Mountain of the Cannibal God.
You mean...
The Pukas are cannibals.
That's right.
Did you see?
I did.
And I know who they are.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am sure.
Maybe you're still being chased by
the ghost of your cannibals?
That's right!
You don't forget the taste of human flesh.
Edward
I'm a doctor.
Maybe I can help you.
You actually took part in their rituals?
Yes.
And it was horrible.
But I was forced to do it,
I had no choice.
From that time, I completely changed,
I'm no longer the same person.
I have lived in this constant nightmare.
Sometimes I think I'm going completely crazy.
I'd like to be able to help you.
But I...
I know.
I've never told anybody
about this experience.
I've been too afraid.
Too ashamed.
But you know...
I sincerely believe...
that if I can just get to that mountain...
and find a way...
And there is a way
to destroy every last one of
those cannibals...
perhaps then...
Perhaps then...
You'll wake up from your nightmare.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It is not wise for you
to go around alone.
Why not?
It's safe enough here.
Take my advice.
Manolo!
Wait.
What is it?
It has been a very, very hard trip.
And now without help,
we may never get there.
Will you take us over there?
Please help us.
To get to the mountain
you have to get through rapids and waterfalls.
It's almost impossible.
And the jungle is too dense.
Are you afraid Puka still exists?
Who knows...
Truth is at the top of the mountain.
Will you come with me?
What are they doing?
There is the juice of some herbs
in those bowls
on contact with saliva
there is a chemical reaction
which transforms it into a
very potent liquor.
What does Father Moses think?
He pretends not to know.
Moses has been living in this mission
for 30 years.
Probably at first he was stricter
than now.
This will bring you happiness.
You did not answer my question
if you come with me?
Will you come?
Two years ago I came up here alone.
I think I always had a flair for adventure.
So I thought... Why not the jungle?
I wanted to test myself.
I thought here I had reached
the end of the world. But it's not true.
It is even further.
Mysterious and frightening.
The challenge is not over yet.
We're leaving alone.
Only the two of us.
No one should know.
And the others?
I don't know...
I don't trust them anymore.
Something's going on and I don't understand.
But if you help me...
Help! Help!
Asaro...
They are all down by the river
for the funeral rites.
Vancho and Sura
will be buried together.
It's not my fault.
She came to me, she, last night.
Sulita hit it for me,
but that wasn't not my fault.
There's something I must tell you.
When I escaped from the Puka village..
I was not alone.
The young boy that I cured
came with me.
He was...
Asaro!
Why did he disappear?
Why did he want to kill us?
His tribe, I believe
they found him and put him
Bullshit.
You saw their village
was completely destroyed.
Not completely.
I suppose some of them
they survived.
I'll tell you what happened.
Asaro tried to stop us
from going to reach his mountain.
He was a Puka.
The last of them.
And now he's dead.
And I'm ready
to move on towards the mountain.
So am I.
Edward, you have a stab wound,
you should stay here.
Manolo will come with us.
I don't think Edward wants it
to miss all the fun.
Do you, Edward?
Let's hit the road.
You brought vice and death
to my mission!
Nobody has ever attacked us
in all these years.
And now it has happened.
But it was you they wanted to kill.
Not my peaceful people.
You showed them adultery, fornication.
And this is the result!
Sura and Vancho are dead.
They will never again be among us.
Now go!
I don't wish to see any of you again.
Go, all of you!
Forever!
Forever.
Look there!
Animals only follow their instincts,
like any living being.
Killing and eating.
Man too has the same instincts.
But he uses more subtle methods.
Lies,
trickery..
The wound is infected.
All I can do is have these worms
to suck some of the bad blood.
He is burning up.
It was madness to let him come.
If he insisted on coming along
That means he has his very own good reason.
That's how it is!
That's right. I have mine, you have yours.
Just as Henry had his.
What are yours?
Do you want the truth?
Your husband knew Ra-Rami
possessed resources
that could make him rich
beyond any imagination.
But he wanted all for himself.
So he left without telling me
and he came here alone.
That's not true. Henry would
never do such a thing.
It's true.
Fortunately, I don't care about money.
Susan, I promise you...
Your husband's reasons for coming here
were not in the interest for science.
Edward is right.
Henry only thought about himself.
I'm sure he wanted to kick us all.
That's enough!
That's all I can take!
Don't move!
I don't kill animals.
I suppose I have to thank you.
It's impossible!
I told you!
It's gonna get worse!
- Should not we go to the shore?
- Yes, over there!
Manolo!
Get on!
We have to leave it here!
We will not get to the mountains without her.
We have to take the canoe upstream,
beside the river.
It would take long. In fact,
you said Henry went without...
and he got there.
Canoe is the only way to
we all go forward.
Edward would not make it otherwise.
Help me.
Arthur.
Help.
Arthur! Here.
Do you think you can make it?
Yeah.
I think so.
Let's go.
We have to climb up there.
Arthur!
Arthur.
Arthur, help me!
Help - me!
Help - him!
Not!
You killed him! You didn't do anything to save him!
- Bastard..
- Manolo!
Stop it! Leave him alone!
How could you take a life.
People like you don't deserve pity!
I've had enough. I'm going back.
Manolo...
Manolo. I have to find Henry.
Don't leave me now.
Please, let's continue.
Susan!
It's blood.
These are ritualistic
For us, I think.
Let's go up and have a look.
No, I feel like a rest.
I'll wait for you here.
The Puka!
These remains are fresh.
So they still exist.
Let's go back to Arthur.
He shouldn't be alone.
Arthur!
Where are you going? Come back!
Arthur! Come!
Arthur! You're mad! Come back!
Susan!
Arthur!
Wait!
The Geiger counter has gone crazy!
Be careful. It's very
radioactive.
It's uranium. High concentration.
It's uranium!
It's incredible!
We found it!
Henry's maps were right.
We'll be rich, Arthur, rich.
Just like you said,
that will bring me happiness.
You, like Foster, believed the story
of the faithful wife,
looking for her lost husband...
Didn't you, Manolo?
Henry tried to keep us out of this,
but we knew that
he was coming here for uranium.
So I had to convince Foster
that all I wanted was to look for my husband.
Otherwise, we would never helped us..
So the search was just an excuse.
Henry cheated me.
And also, he was going to leave me.
It's not my fault that he disappeared.
My God, you have no limits, both of you!
Now I know why you let Foster die.
He was an fool idealist.
He wanted to exploit all this wealth
only for humanitarian purposes.
At least, his values
were higher than yours!
He had little interest in money.
While that's all you seem to care about.
For the moment, yes.
We can sell this information to the great powers.
And we will be rich.
You too can help us.
To help you exploit this island
and its people?
To help you destroy the forests and bring it
the so-called progress to a place like this?
No.
Stay where you are.
Put your rifle down.
You'll have to help us take samples
and take us back.
Understand?
God!
Henry always had this on him.
It is my husband.
They made him into a god.
They probably thought the Geiger counter
was his heart.
Proof of his immortality.
Now, you are the god's woman.
That photograph would be something
supernatural for people like these.
Susan!
Susan!
Susan!
No, Susan!
Not!
Don't!
Don't do it, Susan!
Don't...
Susan!
I think I found a way out.
Wait!
There's a tree trunk over there.
Let's use the current.
Careful!
Manolo...
Let's try to get back home.
