Shit!
Bingo.
Damn!
Fire!
Incoming!
- Hit the deck!
Yes!
Yeah!
I don´t think so.
- Good work, Agent Marcus.
- Thank you.
Great shooting, Mahoney.
Now clean up all that shit, huh?
ID, please.
All right, sir.
Name - Voorhees, Jason.
This case is eyes only. This tape
is strictly for internal distribution.
Anyone listening needs
C-4 clearance or higher.
If not - you´re in a heap of trouble! 
Ooh...
Jesus!
We have a large male Caucasian...
..with massive tissue loss
due to extreme explosive trauma.
Weight - I´d say 230, maybe... 240.
And third-degree burns
over 65%% of the anterior torso.
First and second
over... the posterior torso.
In addition to explosive trauma,...
..the subject is a victim of...
..multiple...
..bullet wounds.
At a glance, l´d say...
..we´re looking at well over...
..a hundred bullet wounds of...
..varying calibre.
This is gonna be a real joy to count.
Now,...
..in my professional opinion,...
..this guy´s deader than shit!
- Hee!
Strike that last comment from the record.
Evidence upon examination,
indicates severe pulmonary oedema.
I´d say the heart appears to be
twice the size of a normal heart.
It´s malformed.
Fatty deposits - Ieft, right atria.
The heart appears to be filled
with a black, viscous fluid.
Frankly, I don´t know what the hell it is.
It´s not blood.
ID!
- You just saw me come outta there.
- ID, please.
Oh! One second.
It tickles!
Y´know, Phil, this is actually
kind of an amazing opportunity.
How many people get to say whatever
they want to Jason fucking Voorhees?
Hey, fuck!
How you doing, you fat-ass,
maggoty, blown-up fuck?
Suck this!
Suck it.
You know what l´d like to do to you?
I´d like to take a crap
right on your fucking mask.
A big, old, mango-sized crap.
Yes,... that´s a probe.
Phil!
Phil!
So, doc, what´s the verdict? Jason going
to be getting up and walking round soon?
We really nailed that fucker.
He weren´t nothing
but a big old pussy, anyway.
Tonight on American Casefile.
Jason Voorhees - dead or deadly?
These photos were taken in the aftermath
of the autopsy ofJason Voorhees.
The facts? Two security men - dead.
A coroner - dead.
Another coroner - missing.
Are these men victims of a serial killer
only believed to be deceased?
Many say yes.
Hi, l´m Robert Campbell.
For over 20 years, the mere mention
of the name Jason Voorhees...
..has been enough to send a shudder
of fear through the hearts of a nation.
Born in 1946
to Elias and Pamela Voorhees...
..Jason was believed to have drowned in
Camp Crystal Lake at the age of eleven.
Sadly, he did not.
Since then, he has been responsible
for 83 confirmed murders...
..and speculated scores of others.
Tonight, on a very special episode
ofAmerican Casefile,...
..we´ll show you an interview
conducted with Mr Creighton Duke...
..just one week after
Jason´s alleged termination.
Remember, Mr Duke
is the bounty hunter...
..responsible for the capture of six of
this country´s most reviled serial killers.
Let´s go to the tape.
For the first time, our cameras got
a glimpse of the training compound...
..of bounty hunter Creighton Duke.
Duke invited us with the promise of a very
unusual, very expensive proposition.
And I think you´ll agree,
in typical Creighton Duke fashion,...
..he gave us much more
than we bargained for.
Just watch.
I´m going to say two words to you...
..and I want you to say the first thing
that comes into your mind. Ok?
- Ok.
- You ready?
- Shoot.
- Jason Voorhees.
Well, that makes me think of...
..a little girl in a pink dress
sticking a hot dog through a doughnut.
I was actually referring to your claim
that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead.
What you think of as Jason...
is not Jason.
That body he´s wearing - that´s just meat.
The boy knows how to dress.
He wears other people´s bodies
like folks wear a suit.
He might get blown up
but that´s a minor inconvenience for him.
He´ll just get hisself another body.
Jason Voorhees,
the true Jason Voorhees,...
..is something you and I have
never seen before, Mr Campbell.
There´s only one way
to put an end to him for all time.
And l´m the only one that knows the way.
So if you want him dead, truly dead,...
..500 grand is my fee.
And for that you get the mask,
the machete, the whole damn thing.
- Quite a character.
In the week following
our interview with Creighton Duke,...
..there have been five more
Jason-style murders.
All, perhaps not surprisingly,...
..on a direct path from the federal morgue
in Youngstown, Ohio,...
..where Jason´s remains were flown,...
to Crystal Lake.
Tonight,...
in the interest ofpublic safety,...
..l am prepared to offer Creighton Duke
his sum of$500,000.
Payable only after he provides American
Casefile and the American people...
..with incontrovertible proof
ofJason´s existence...
..and then puts an end to him for all time.
We´ll be back with American Casefile
in a moment.
- This is truly sick.
- Tell me about it.
No, this is not sick, Diana, it´s business.
People are gonna come to see
Jason´s hometown with appetites.
- Di, food´s up.
- Thanks, Shel.
Hey, Ma, do you really want me
to cut these like this?
- Yes, I do.
- They look stupid.
It´s your own dumb-assed fault. They´re
supposed to look like hockey masks!
Now watch.
This makes a whole new patty.
Hence, the two-for-one burger sale.
God, I love this woman. Hold me back!
You guys make me sick.
What can I get you?
I´ll take a Voorhees burger
and a side of Jason fingers.
Ok, anything else?
Yes.
Creighton Duke.
I know who you are.
I´m gonna kill Jason Voorhees.
I need you to help me.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know he´s not, I know he´s not.
And he´s coming for you.
Your food´ll be right out.
Name your price.
Everyone has a price. What´s yours?
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.
And you know why I need you.
I think you need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
I know who you really are.
What´s the problem here?
I was just making your girlfriend
a little proposition, chief,...
..she´s thinking it over.
Right, love?
Go on. Get up.
Why don´t you blow me, chief. Mm?
Right after your girlfriend gets through.
That´s my lady you´re talking about.
Now see, she is only your lady because...
..she ain´t had a taste of the Duke yet.
- Well, dammit!
- Careful, careful, chief.
I don´t think you really know who I am.
I know who you are.
The last thing we need here is some
freako bounty hunter causing trouble.
I want you out of this town
and I want you out now.
- Now that is very colourful, chief.
- Randy!
Take him out to my car.
I´ll be out in a minute.
All right, let´s go.
He´s coming for you, Diana.
And your daughter.
Lock your doors.
I´m sorry if he upset you.
I don´t need you to fight my battles.
I don´t need any part-time protection!
You Ok?
- Yeah.
- Ok.
Seems to think Jason´s ´´coming for you´´.
Stephen, I need to talk to you.
There´s something you don´t know about
Jessica, something that you should know.
She was gonna tell you herself,
but, uh, there may not be enough time.
If you still care about her, if you still
wanna make things right between you,...
..then we should talk.
Ok, let´s talk.
Yeah, but not here.
Come to my house tonight at eleven.
And don´t be late.
Ow!
 Ah-hah-hah-hah. Ow! 
Right!
Hi.
Thank you so much.
We have been there for an hour.
Thanks a lot, man.
So,... where we heading?
We´re going to Camp Crystal Lake.
Oh, yeah?
Planning on smoking dope, having
premarital sex and getting slaughtered?
A joke. It´s just a joke.
A little Crystal Lake levity.
- So, uh, why are you going to the camp?
- Now that Jason´s dead...
We´re thinking about smoking some dope,
having premarital sex...
..and, uh, not worry about
getting slaughtered.
Ah, to be young again.
Here´s where the camp was. They tore
the cabins down but this is the place.
Excellent!
Hey, thanks a lot.
Come with us.
We´re thinking of going
skinny-dipping later.
God. I´d love to...
..but, um, I gotta meet someone later.
Oh,... your girlfriend?
Go on. Have fun.
You don´t know what you´re missing.
Let´s do it.
Oh, my God, that water.
Ah! Ah!
Oh!
Shrank my pod!
Your pod looks pretty good from here.
Mm!
Hey, come here.
- Um,...
..do you mind if we use the tent
for half an hour?
No, no, no. Actually, take it for the
whole night, l´m going to sleep out here.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I think it´s a beautiful night.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, l´m sure. Go... Go! Go!
Go, go, go,... go, go...
Damn!
Come on, let´s do it.
You think you´re ready
for Tony the Wonder Llama?
You got a rubber?
In my pack outside.
- I´ll get ´em.
- No! No, no, no,...
Forget it. Forget about it.
I gotta pee anyway.
I have to go out there anyway.
I´ll be right back.
Oh!
Hurry up.
- I found it.
- Yeah?
- That´s nice.
Oh God, Debbie, I hate these things.
- Debbie! Help!
- Tango? Tango?
- Oh, there you are. Well, come here.
There. Yeah.
Oh, sweetheart, there you are. Yeah.
- Di, it´s me, Josh.
I... I was just going to my car.
I didn´t mean to scare you.
- Here.
- It´s all right.
Oh, thanks. 
Look, hon´,...
..don´t worry about Ed, he´ll come around.
He´s too smart a guy
to let you get away, you know?
I guess l´m just a little, uh,
too old for going steady.
So is he and he knows it.
Trust me... it´ll work out.
- Thanks.
- Good night, beautiful.
Good night, Josh.
Hello, baby. 
Not here. Oh, sorry l´m late.
What´s the big deal?
Did Roy´s bowling go late?
The League changed the damned time,
we´ve only got till ten thirty.
- Get in!
Fuck!
What the fuck are you doing?!
You fuck!
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- Guess what? I have a new boyfriend.
- You´ll never guess who.
- Well, what´s his name?
- I want it to be a surprise.
- Ah, someone I know?
No, but you´ll recognise him.
We´re gonna come for a visit next
weekend. He really wants to meet you.
- Can you hold on just a second?
- Sure.
Hi.
- How´s the baby?
- Great. Have you seen her father lately?
- Steven´s coming over tonight.
- Mom!
- He´s still asking about you.
- I don´t wanna talk to him.
I don´t want to see him when l´m home.
He can see the baby if he wants.
Can you tell him?
- I´ll tell him.
- I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, baby. Um...
Mom?
What are you doing? Josh!
Oh, Jesus!
No!  No!
You mother...
- ..fucker!
Yes, hi. Is Sheriff Landis there?
This is Jessica kimble.
Could you please patch me through?
 No!
No!
Diana?
- Oh, shit!
You saw him.
You know who he is?
You have to save Jessica.
Save Jessica and the...
The what?!
Save Jessica...
..and...
- Diana?
It was Josh.
He´s still outsi...
Where the hell is he?
Oh,... my dear God.
He was dead. He had to be dead!
Y-y-y-you can´t think that l... ?
I don´t believe you murdered Diana.
I don´t know what happened.
And I know you couldn´t have done it.
You just sit tight, eh?
I will straighten everything out.
Randy, what am I gonna do?
What´s Jessica gonna do?
Jessica! l´m, uh,... I´m so sorry. I wanted to
have this cleaned up before you got here.
That´s all right. I was just...
- Oh, God...
Oh, my gosh!
Who´s this?
A girl?
She´s beautiful.
She yours?
Her name´s Stephanie.
- She has Steven´s eyes.
Why didn´t you tell me?
I was going to. I was going to
tell everybody, I just didn´t...
I didn´t expect to be back here so soon.
Is Steven around?
Yeah. Listen, there´s... There´s something
I need to tell you about Steven.
Hopefully, we won´t have to hold you
for more than a day.
I am going to bust my ass
to prove that you are innocent.
But you are gonna have to stay cool cos
otherwise Landis is gonna kill you, Ok?
Come on.
The sheriff´s right this way.
All right, l´ll be back later.
Don´t do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do?
l´m locked in a fricking cell.
I´m gonna get you out of this
but you gotta hang tight.
Ok.
Oh, wait.
Everything you need is in this bag.
- Yeah. Ok.
- White bottle: twelve o´clock.
- Green bottle: one, one thirty.
- And hard liquor at dinner time(?)
Don´t worry.
What time would you like me
to pick her up?
Um,... come by the diner around eight.
Ok. Bye, sweetheart. Don´t you
give Vicki a hard time. Bye-bye.
Thanks, Vicki.
Hey, you take good care of her.
- Of course.
- Jessie, I got a few papers here,...
- ..if I can get your signature on them.
- All right.
You´re about
the saddest-looking sack of shit l´ve seen.
Why don´t you just shut up?
Accused of murder.
And not just any murder, but the murder
of the mother of the girl you love.
I didn´t do it.
Oh, I know that. Problem is...
..how you gonna get anyone else
to believe you?
It was Jason that killed Diana.
What did you say?
There´s only one way
to put an end to that devil.
And they don´t know the way.
And you do?
- Tell me!
- Information like that... is very expensive.
- What´s your price?
- You´re too much of a coward to afford it.
Try me.
Give me your hand.
- What?
- Your hand,...
..give it to me.
See,...
..everything and everyone...
..has a price.
And the cost of this is very, very high.
Are you ready to pay?
- What´s the price?
- Are you ready to pay?
Yes.
- Ow! Fuck!
The only way to kill Jason Voorhees
is to destroy his heart.
And there´s only one person can do that
now that Diana´s dead.
Her daughter.
- Jessica?
- And he will try to get to her first.
- Well, what does he want?
- Same thing he wanted her mother for.
What?
You want information,...
..you gotta pay.
Come on!
Your hand.
- You ready to pay?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
-  Ooh, Jeez! Ow.
Those FBI idiots destroyed Jason´s body
so now he needs a new one.
The ones he´s jumping in and out of,
they can´t last.
They get diseased, he gets weak.
Jason needs to be reborn again
and he needs Jessica to do it.
Why Jessica?
Now, see, that is a very, very
expensive question, boy.
And... I don´t think you´ve got what it takes
to pay the price.
Tell me.
This one´s on the house.
In a Voorhees was he born,
through a Voorhees may he be reborn.
And only by the hands of a Voorhees
will he die.
Jason had a sister:...
..your girlfriend´s mother, Diana.
Now that she´s dead,...
..he has only two blood relatives left
in the world with the power to kill him...
..or make him reborn.
Jessica and her baby.
I´ve gotta get outta here.
I´ve gotta protect them.
The only way to do that is to kill Jason
and you can´t! But Jessica can.
Tell Jessica about her birthright.
Make her believe you.
Go to the Voorhees´ house. Find proof.
Because if you don´t, Jason will kill her...
..and your baby.
Randy! Randy!
Agh! God.
- What the hell´s going on?
- That son of a bitch broke my fingers.
- Jesus! Shit!
- Let me take a look, Ok? Here.
- Shit!
Quiet.
You asshole.
Ok,...
..carefully, carefully, open the cell.
You wouldn´t kill me.
You might be right.
Ok. Ok, Steven.
Steven,... Iisten to me, please?
Don´t do this.
You escape, they´ll shoot you on sight.
That´s a chance l´m gonna have to take.
So I lose a bundle today.
Screw it.
I loved that little lady.
Don´t pretend to be so noble. You should
have closed up until after the funeral.
- Sure. Two days off with pay, right?
- Hey, hey, baby. Not now.
Believe it or not, l´m hurt too, and
not just financially. What the fuck is that?
- It´s Jessica´s baby.
- Get it the fuck out. This isn´t a nursery.
Hey. I believe that´s the sweetest thing
God ever put on this earth.
- You´s a little cutie pie.
- It´ll be as cute on the street. Get it out!
Yeah? Yeah.
No shit?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. If I see him, l´ll call.
Ok.
- What was that all about?
- Hey, the baby can stay.
Go to the storeroom and make a crib out
of a box or something. Go, go, go, go, go!
- Steven Freeman escaped. With a gun.
- Jesus. They know where he´s headed?
knowing Freeman, he turned ass
and he bolted to Canada.
But just in case he didn´t...
- Hey, let me do it.
- Oh!
Jesus, Pookie.
Ok, we got your bear.
I know this isn´t a palace
but it´ll have to do.
God, you look so much like your daddy.
Ok,... we´ll put you in here.
I´ll come back and check on you,
make sure you´re Ok. Ok?
Oh, Jesus.
I don´t even know your name.
Steven.
This is... my baby.
It´s the first time l´ve ever
been able to touch my baby.
Take my car. Get out.
- Ward, l...
- Get out.
Thank you.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, my... !
- No!
Yah?
Hey, Reggie, what´s happening?
Oh, yeah, l´m there now.
It´s great, it´s disgusting.
Look, I want to dress stuff. Maybe we can
put a few body parts in the refrigerator?
Well, Reg, talk to Harry in props.
You know what we´re going for here:...
.. Twisted Secrets of the Voorhees´ House
Revealed.
Oh, and also,...
..one more thing.
Guess what tomorrow´s headline
is gonna read?
Body of Slain Voorhees´ Woman
Stolen from Morgue.
Well, last night, I stole Diana´s body
and I hid it here in the closet.
And then I went home
and fucked her daughter. (laughs)
Reg.
Reg, Reg, you wanna calm down.
Listen, I talked Jessica
into letting us shoot here, right?
I´ll bring the police,
they´ll discover the body on camera,...
..and our ratings will go
right through the fucking roof!
How does that grab you?
Jesus! Aagh!
Robert?
Hello?
You scared the hell out of me.
Where have you been?
- Robert!
Get away from her!
What... Where are you taking me?
- Come on!
- What? My God! Steven, put me down.
I don´t want to go with you.
I am gonna kill you!
You put me down this second.
I´m gonna kill you!
- Oh!
- Get in the car. Get in the car!
What is wrong? What is going on?
- Will somebody tell me?
- Shut up!
Shit.
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God.
- God, Steven!
Pull this car over!
Steven, I mean it! Stop this car!
- What, are you out of your mind?!
- Just calm down. Shut the fuck up!
Please. Just listen.
All right. Now you think I killed Robert
back there, right?
And there´s no way he could´ve lived?
Just tell me, did I kill him or not?
- Yes, you killed him.
- Wrong.
He is not dead and that is not Robert.
Jess, I did not kill your mother.
Yesterday, Josh, or someone
that looked like Josh, killed her.
That was after she blew off
the back of his head.
I stabbed him with a poker through
the heart and the son of a bitch still lived.
Steven, please let me go.
You and the baby are in danger.
I can help.
I won´t leave you this time, Jess.
- Yeah, you will, Steven.
- I promise I won´t.
Jess,... Iet´s go to the baby.
Fucking psycho! You killed my mother,
you think l´d let you near my baby?!
- Ow!
- Out! Out, get out! Get away from me!
- Come on!
- Jess, please!
- Get away from me!
- Get away!
- Jess! Jess!
Damn it. No! No.
Ed! Ed! I just left Steven
out on Lake Road. He killed Robert!
- Slow down. You all right?
- He ran him over. I was at my mother´s...
- Did he hurt you?
- Not me. Robert!
- You said he´s on Lake Road. Where?
- I don´t know.
- Past the Meyers´ place.
- Ok, we´ll get him. You´re safe now.
Notify all the units on the Lake Road.
I want this kid.
Don´t shoot. Don´t shoot.
Oh, Randy.
Son of a bitch!
Fuck this!
- Hey, you Ok?
- Agh!
God. Oh!
- Get in the fucking car, Steven.
You get in the car!
You want me to cuff you?
What makes you think you can?
I got a gun!
Fuck that.
I got a gun.
You totally wrecked Jessica.
- Jessica. You´ve seen Jessica?
- Yes, I have seen Jessica.
Where is she?
At the station.
Cuff me.
Cuff me!
Randy just picked Steven up.
He´s bringing him in.
Jessie, follow Officer Ryan.
She´ll give you some clothes.
All we have are cop uniforms.
Anything´s fine.
One sec.
You all right, mister? Wait a second.
What the... ?
You find her and you find her quick.
- Yeah. I´ll wait to hear from you.
- Stop right there!
Steven, help me!
Jessica!
Move!
What in the hell was that?
Officer down!
He´s breathing.
Let´s check this guy at the end of the hall.
Fuck!
Christ!
Get the ambulance.
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Agh!
- Vick, where´s the baby?
- She´s fine.
- Where´s the baby?
- She´s in the back.
Whoa! Hold it right there.
Don´t move a fucking muscle,
either of you.
Joanne...
Shut up. You´re with him. Nobody´s gonna
touch that fucking ray of sunshine.
- Pookie, call the station.
- I´m doing it, baby, l´m doing it.
Holy shit.
Line´s dead.
Son of a bitch. Ward, go and see
what´s going on at the station.
- Don´t let him go. He´ll get killed.
- Shut up! Go on.
- Ma, he just...
- Ward!
- Little mister, just in case.
- Whoo!
- Honey, watch the willy.
- Ma!
- Ward, don´t. Please.
- Shut up! keep your hands up - high.
Bad-dang!
Bad-dang!
Joey, please.
Just let me get the baby and we´ll go.
- Shut the fuck up. You´re with a felon.
- Hey, now, babe, watch the language.
- Fuck you!
- Now look what you´ve fucking done!
- Give me the baby, Joey!
- Fuck you!
Sorry.
Stop. I mean it.
- Come on!
Go. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go!
She´s gone.
- Where is she?
- Vicki must have moved her.
- In here. Come on.
She´s gotta be in here.
- Holy shit!
- Pookie!
Don´t let him through.
Stop!
Oh... shit!
Get away from him,
you fucking piece of shit, skull-faced,...
..cocksucker, motherfucker!
Jess!
Ah! No!
Go to hell!
Oh God, Vick.
I´m gonna try and get some help.
Shit.
Jessica!
Jessica, wait!
Fuck! Damn.
I have your baby.
Come to the Voorhees´ house alone.
Christ.
You´re alone.
Good girl.
Jason could have jumped
into anyone by now but you.
We haven´t been formally introduced.
My name is Creighton Duke.
What the hell do you think you´re doing
grabbing my baby and bringing her here?
Hold it.
Duke, Robert is dead.
I know about your bounty but you´re
never gonna see any of that money now.
It´s over.
Just give me the baby.
- Just give me two minutes.
It´s not about the money any more.
- What do you want from me?
- Tonight we can get that bastard.
Tonight we can send Jason Voorhees
to hell for all time.
- You don´t need me for that.
- Yes,...
..l do!
Only through a Voorhees
can he be reborn,...
..and only a Voorhees can kill him.
With that!
No. I won´t put my baby
in any more danger.
You will always be in danger
until Jason is dead.
He won´t stop coming for you
until he gets you, until he´s reborn.
And then he will kill you...
..and your baby.
If you want this to be over,
if you want your baby out of danger,...
..then you will end it now.
Before more people have to die,
like your friends, like your mother.
Because until you kill him,...
..it will never be over.
Oh, are you sleepy?
Mm? That could be Steven.
Jason will have jumped
into a new body by now.
You can´t trust anyone.
- It couldn´t be Steven.
- Anyone. Do you understand?
Duke!
- Jessica?
- Ed?
- No!
- Oh, no!
- Shit!
kill him! Do it!
Ed, is it really you?
- Of course.
- Stay there!
- Give me the knife.
- I thought you were dead.
- You were wrong.
- Don´t come any closer.
-kill him!
- I can´t!
- Oh...
- Freeze!
- Get the hell away from her, Ed!
- Duke, what should I do?
- kill the both of them!
- No!
- Do it, or die!
Jessica, give me the knife.
- Stay back!
- Jessica!
Oh!
Shit!
Get off! Get away from her!
Steven!
Where is it?!
- I don´t know!
Duke?!
l´m coming.
- I´ll help you.
- Give me your hand.
Come on! 
Here!
Hurry!
- Where´s the dagger?
- It´s under the dresser.
- Well, get it!

- What´s it doing?
- I don´t know.
Duke, that part about being
reborn in a Voorhees woman,...

- No.
That thing´s in the basement
with Jessica´s mother.
- Holy Mother of God.
Quick, the dagger.
Help her!
Get the damn dagger!
- Lift it up, lift it up!
- Ok.
- I can´t!
- Jessica!
You son of a bitch. You remember me?
- Get the dagger!
Tonight, my friend, you will...
Jessica!

Duke!
Oh, God!
Get away from them,

No!
Oh!

Go... to... hell!
