It's good. Freaking Marcus, I bet ??getting up here by myself, like practical joke or something, you know. What am i gonna do?
Well, maybe David...could go there with you,...

Or... you could use our phone, call your friend.

Doesn't he?
He loves me.
You don't hurt people you love. Do you?
I have to learn. Pain is a teacher.
And I know what it is like.
Nobody understands you. Nobody sees you for who you are.
But Harlan paid attention.
He's older, he's smarter...
...it's nice to have somebody like him notices you.
- He makes you feel important.
- Do you think he's just using me?
- No!
- He's not!
No...

I counseled him...
...and I think I really got through to him, you know.
And he sent me this Christmas card.
He said he changed his life.
Doctor Goodman.
You were my only hope.
I just wanted to live.
Can't you understand that?
You thought I deserved it.??? justify in your own head.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Sorry isn't enough.There is only one way out of this.

Pain, doesn't lie.
Pain is the only reality.
What part do you want to lose, Sam?
Okay.
But you have to do yourself.
You're joking!
How am I supposed to do that?
If I were you, I'd break bone first, then use the cutters...
...to get the tendons and flesh and then...
I can't...
That's the rules. You created this situation and you know this is right.
Okay.
That's my girl!???
