That's it.
Good girl.
Good boy.
My dear Lukka.
Eat some more.
Yes.
Come along.
Hello, there.
That's it.
There you go.
You'll do just fine.

In this nation,
none has played a larger role
in our survival
through ice and fire.
Resistant and tough,
whatever happens,
mankind's saviour and
friend for a thousand years,
all year round,
in joy and disharmony,
sheep are woven into our
farmers' work and being.
Bright was the outlook
when our sheep felt fine.
Black were the nights when
the flock was in decline.
Now it's time to award the
prizes for the three best,
and Katrin the vet
is going to do that.
Third prize goes to Finnur
Gudjonsson and his ram Heysi.
Heysi comes from Kveikur
and Goa from Svínafell.
He got 84 points.
Second place goes to
Gudmundur Bodvarsson
with his ram Garpur.
Garpur is item the famous Bolstadur breed,
from Godi and Birta.
He got 86 points.
I must point out that it
was a very close call
between the two top rams.
The result was determined by
the thickness of the back muscle.
The rams are both from
the same renowned stock,
and this year's winner is...
Kristinn Bodvarsson
and his ram Sproti.
Sproti comes from Loki
and Sturla from Bolstad.
He got 86.5 points.
- Congratulations, my dear Kiddi.
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations, dear Gummi.
Well done.
- A toast to the Bolstadar brothers!
- Yes.
No, thank you.
It was really close.
Just a difference in one bit of muscle.
- You'll take it next year, Gummi.
- Yes, you will.
Good luck with everything.
Come here.
Let me see your back muscle.
What?
Something wrong?
Good boy.
Come along.
Easy, now.
Calm down.
Calm down, Garpur.
You did well, my dear Sproti.
That's it. That's my boy.
Let me see you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Gudmundur.
- Hello, Gummi.
- Hello, dear Hildur.
- How are you?
- All good.
- Can I have a word with you?
- Yes, yes.
I'm going to have
a word with Gummi.
Is something wrong?
I'm afraid something is
wrong with Kiddi's sheep.
Oh?
What could it be?
I'm afraid it might
be scrapie.
Scrapie?
It could hardly be...
- That ram of his,
the one that won. - Yes.
I examined him yesterday.
He has all the symptoms.
My dear Gummi, don't you think
Katrin would have noticed
if the prize ram had scrapie?
Do you want me
to talk to Kiddi?
- Get someone to examine the ram?
- Would you do that?
You haven't spoken to
each other in 40 years.
Why begin now?
If it turns out to be scrapie,
wouldn't it be likely
that both of our herds would
have to be slaughtered?
I don't believe it's scrapie.
We've never had
any cases of scrapie.
How could it have
been brought here?
Aren't you just still recovering
from the ram competition?
Take that, you bastard!
You won't get away with this!
Fucking ram murderer!
He doesn't have
fucking scrapie.
You're just making it up.
You're just a sore loser!
Gummi?
Gummi, can you hear me?
What happened?
There was a shooting
practice yesterday.
I heard that Kiddi's ram
was taken for examination?
Do you think he
could have scrapie?
You'll have to
ask him about that.
I just spoke to him.
He said it's all
coming from you.
Yes?
He said that, did he?
I'm no expert
on scrapie, Grímur.
But when I examined
the ram yesterday,
that was the first thing
that came to mind.
Damn it.
If we have scrapie in the valley,
we're in deep shit.
You lot over on the east side
have no need to worry
if scrapie shows up here.
We borrowed him this winter.
The creature sired
half our lambs.
Invoice
Two windows
To Kiddi.
What's up, my friend?
What do you have there?
Hi, Gudmundur.
I have bad news.
Your brother's sheep
are infected with scrapie.
We are investigating
the nearest farms.
May we look in
your sheep shed?
Yes.
A case of scrapie has been found
on the Bolstad farm in Bardardalur.
This is the first occurrence
of the disease in this valley.
According to Katrin Nielsen,
the district vet,
the scrapie was diagnosed
in an adult ram,
and tests are being
carried out to determine
whether it's present
on neighbouring farms.
No decision has been
made concerning a slaughter.
It is believed that
scrapie came to Iceland
with British sheep at
the end of the 19th century,
and has not yet been
entirely eliminated here.
It is an infectious disease that attacks
the brains and spinal cords of sheep,
and is incurable.
Dear friends.
Results of the
tests just arrived.
Scrapie was found
on two other farms,
at Haugi and Seljatunga.
It has therefore
been decided
that all the sheep in the
valley must be slaughtered.
Is this the final decision?
They say that there's been
enough contact between them,
and in order to
eliminate the disease,
they've got to take
the entire valley.
Why not just take us, too?
Finish the job!
We need to trust the vets.
They don't know anything.
University educated
fools from down south.
- What would you do, Kiddi?
- I want us to put a stop to this nonsense!
- How are we supposed to do that?
- We just refuse to slaughter our sheep.
How do you think it will be
to live here with no sheep?
- Have you thought about that?
- It's just for two years.
And then what?
Import some hormone-sheep
from the Westfjords?
I agree with Kiddi. We can't just say
yes and amen to these veterinarians.
They're not holy.
I trust Katrin to make the
right decision in this matter.
As I see it, it's a question of whether
we want to cut down now,
or to have the scrapie hanging
over us in the coming years.
Just do what you want, Finnur.
I'll have nothing to do with it.
It's very important now
that we stand together.
This is a great
shock to all of us,
and it's understandable
that people are wounded.
But the decision
has been taken,
and it will not be changed.
LINE OF DEFENCE
Sheep diseases - contagious!
Yes, Gudmundur.
Yes.
Yes, hello, Katrin.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, that's true.
Yes, that's life.
Yes...
No, I want to bury them here.
They were raised here,
and I want them to rest here.
Yes. No.
I'm certain about that.
Yes.
Yes, goodbye.
My dear girl.
Let me go, you bastards!
Leave my sheep alone!
Why did you do this, Gummi?
I wanted to kill
my sheep myself.
- Is this all of them?
- Yes.
147 sheep.
Very well.
Clean this up.
You've got to follow
the rules, Gummi.
You shouldn't have
slaughtered them yourself.
If we're to eradicate this disease,
you've got to follow the rules.
We pay for every sheep
that's slaughtered,
and you're also paid so-called
"product loss compensation",
according to average production
for the past three years.
Payments are distributed
over a two-year period,
then you can apply
to acquire new sheep.
The vets will assist you in
cleaning out your buildings.
Any questions?
No.
I don't think so.
Have you thought
about the future?
Will you keep on farming?
Where do I sign?
There, at the bottom.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Listen...
Do you think you can help me
get in touch with Kristinn?
He lives next door.
Yes, I know.
But he hasn't wanted to talk to us.
Could you talk to him?
You're brothers, right?
Kiddi and I don't
speak to each other.
You need to clean everything.
The shit, the hay,
everything on the floor.
- Also the wood.
- And the pens?
Yes, those also.
All wood.
This pitchfork here.
Everything that you've used in here.
Tools, clothing, everything.
You need to destroy all of it.
It's best to burn it.
You also need to clean out the
barn and destroy all the hay.
And absolutely don't sell it.
Scrapie can be
transmitted by hay mites.
- Do I need to destroy all the hay?
- Yes.
Well, Gummi?
What do you say now?
Do you know what
you've done?
You've wiped out
the Bolstadar stock.
This is going to be
a hell of a winter!
No sheep.
Just the two of us.
That's what you wanted!
Isn't that what you wanted?
That's my girls.
Here you go.
Here you go, Garpur.
That's my man.
Good boy.
Have some.
Damn it.
Go away.
Go!
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
- Where did you get it?
- It's from Bogi, in the next valley.
He has more if you need it.
Got some coffee?
No, I don't have any coffee.
Nothing stronger?
No, I'm sorry, Grímur.
I have nothing to offer.
- Did you clean already?
- Yes.
It's fucking boring.
- Has Kiddi started?
- No.
Well, Garpur.
It's your big moment.
Yes.
Well done.
That's the spirit.
Yes, go on, handsome.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah!
You can do it!
Help!
Help!
You have to help me.
I think he's dying.
Help me!
Pull there.
That's it.
- Got it?
- I got it.
- The sweater as well?
- Yes.
That's it.
I came close to driving
right past him.
He was lying in a
ditch just down there.
- Is this man from here?
- Yes.
Has this happened before?
Yes, but it's been a while.
He probably would have frozen
to death if I hadn't found him.
Thanks.
- Do you live together?
- No, he lives next door.
We are brothers.
OK. Have you been
living here long?
I was born and raised here,
grew up where Kiddi lives now.
- His name is Kiddi?
- Yes.
And what, no women?
No.
There aren't many around.
- You haven't had housekeepers?
- No. Not me, at least.
Kiddi had some.
They all ran away from him.
I'm working for the Veterinary Authority.
Disinfecting sheep sheds.
- Weren't your sheep slaughtered?
- Yes.
Must have been hard.
Yes.
What was that?
That... just my cats
playing around.
- OK. Do you have many cats?
- Yes, lots. Merry Christmas, my friend.
Merry Christmas.
- My greetings to your brother.
- I'll pass that on.
Yes.
Well, goodbye.
What do you say?
Have you finished cleaning?
- Yes.
- Yes.
How about you?
No.
We decided to quit.
We're going bankrupt anyway.
So we're just going to take
the opportunity and leave.
- Where will you go?
- We haven't decided.
We can't see living
here two more years
with no sheep and
a pile of loans.
Nor is it certain the
scrapie is going anywhere.
It doesn't need to
come up again, Villi.
Have you talked to the farmers
in Svarfaðardalur?
They've had to slaughter
their sheep three times!
We're still thinking
things over.
The kids have moved out,
and when the sheep are gone,
there won't be much left for us here.
Just to tell it like it is.
It takes an effort to come
here at this time of the year.
Yes, you could say that.
Yes.
It's this matter
with your brother.
As you know,
he hasn't been very cooperative.
It's starting to cause us
considerable concern.
He's the only one
who hasn't cleaned.
Unfortunately,
we can't bring in new sheep
until all sheep sheds
have been disinfected.
There is more to it.
I checked the papers.
Kristinn doesn't own his land?
It's all in your name.
- Yes.
- What's the reason?
My father didn't want
Kiddi to take over.
I promised my mother
before she died
that Kiddi would get
to stay at the old farm.
You know what that means?
You're responsible
for your brother.
He lives on your land,
and if he doesn't follow the rules,
it's you that...
That what?
If it comes to a legal fight,
you'll be the one that's sued.
It would be best if you
two could settle things.
To Kiddi.
So, so, so.
Gummi!
Gummi, are you there,
you bastard?
Gummi, what's this
bullshit you've been writing?
Who the fuck do
you think you are?
Do you think you're my boss?
It's not up to you to
tell me what to do!
- I'll just do what suits me best.
- Shut the fuck up, you fucking wanker.
Are you hungry, my friend?
Here you go.
Thank you, and take care.
Damn it!
Here we go.
I know what you
have in the basement.
Somi.
Somi, my friend.
What have you got there?
Thanks for the loan.
Gummi.
How many are there?
Is there a ram?
What does it matter to you?
Well, these are the only sheep
left of the Bolstadur stock.
- It matters to me.
- Fucking bullshit.
Those are my sheep.
Don't you dare come near them!
Yes, yes.
Fantastic!
Let me see.
Yes, yes, yes.
We'll get two lambs here.
Yes, yes.
Let me see.
Yes, yes.
This is good.
Well, my dear Garpur.
It's over for now.
Fantastic!
100 per cent successful
performance.
Can I use your bathroom?
Yes, yes, go ahead.
Shit!
Thanks.
Let's go.
On your feet!
Kiddi.
You have to help me.
They're coming.
Let's take them inside.
Get in!
- There are no sheep here.
- They were here just before.
I don't believe this, Gummi!
What are you thinking?
Where are the sheep?
Gummi.
Where are the sheep?
Unbelievable!
We have to look.
- We have to look for them.
- They were here before.
Maybe they're up
on the mountain?
Shouldn't we call for help?
Yes.
I guess.
Station, Beggi here.
We can't find them.
Let's get some assistance.
Beggi here.
I found the sheep.
Just right outside.
Help me.
- What should we do with the sheep?
- We take them to the mountains.
- Mountains?
- Yes. Hvannalindir.
- It's way up on the highland!
- If we manage, they'll survive the winter.
Come on.
Let's hurry.
This doesn't look good.
We have to carry on.
Damn it!
Where are the sheep?
Gummi!
Gummi!
Garpur!
Gummi!
Gummi, can you hear me?
It's going to be just fine,
my dear Gummi.
