Subtitles by Seglora
Hi,boys I got you.Why didn't you scram?
Stop and come down
What time is it?
Hello Mrs Kellerson
Hello Tommy
Hang on
-What time is it?
-Four o'clock
Ninety four degrees,said I'll win
-Yeah,who says you win?
-Wait a minute.Dave Harris 91
-Paul 93 Rich 95 Carney 94
-See,what I had tell you,I win
-Come on pay me
-What are you going to buy?
-Gonna save up and buy me a horse
-A horse,where are you going to keep it?
-In the bath tub?
-I'm going to keep it on our ranch
-Since when have you got a ranch?
-Since a while ago
-Where is it?
-Way out West
-Where in down South West?
-Texas,wherever Tombstone is
Anywhere there is Tombstone
What are you talking about,
you haven't got a ranch
You know,it's not really mine,it's my dad's
If your dad got a ranch what are
 you do living here?
As soon they shoot all the Indians,
we're going to move
I was going along today and
 when I came to the corner
all this men were laying on the street
And then a big truck came
 along and killed them all
except one and he was a bandit,so I
took my gun and shot him,all by myself
How many bandits did you kill today?
Well,I didn't have to use too many
 bullets,Pop,the heat drew most of them
The heat is good for something
Sure doesn't make you feel like eating
Cold supper is all I can
think of in this weather
-I liked it,Mom,tasted kind of like chicken
-It was chicken
Sure you don't want some more?
No,I've got some coffee and
doughnuts midnight
It's not good for you
You ought to eat something,Pop,
can't work on an empty stomach
Working nights is not so
good for the appetite
I knew a man that worked at
night once,he was a robber
Tommy, that's enough
I'd think we heard enough
of robberies for one day
Do you mind if we show the
 apartment now Mr Woodry?
Show the apartment, what for?
Since you are moving I like to
 show it as soon as possible
Since when are we moving?
There must be some mistake,Mr Johnston,
we are not moving
Yes you are,I heard it from
 a couple of the tenants
just this afternoon and I
dropped these folks..
I'm afraid it has been a mistake,
Mr Johnston,we are awfully sorry
Tommy.
At it again
I didn't mean any harm,Mom,honest I didn't
You never mean any harm
But like I told you hundred times someday
you are going to get us all in a trouble
What did you say?
It was just some of the kids,we got to talk
and I guess I said we were
 moving out to a ranch
Tommy,how would you feel if
they'd rent the apartment
to those people and put us
out on the street?
-I didn't think they'd believe me
-You never think so
But you see they do
Why do you want to tell stories like that?
I do not know, Pop,I'm sorry.
If you don't stop,I'm going to have to
 punish you,you know that,don't you?
Yes,Sir
Go to your room.
Don't worry about it,Ed,you're
 going to be late for work
Mum
Mum,are you awake?
-What is it,Tommy?
-It's so hot
Can I go and sleep on the fire escape?
I suppose so
But be careful
Joe!
What you have to bungle up like
 that,why didn't you fix his drink
I did ,Joe,but I guess there
 is something to it
See if there is anyone in the hallway
-I didn't see anybody
-Take a look out the window.
Nobody there
Here is his identification papers
He is a mate on a ship
That's good,they disappear easily
Mum!Mum!
What?
-I got something awful to tell you
-What is it?
-I just saw a murder.
-A murder? Where?
Upstairs at Kellerson.
-They've just stabbed a man
-Oh for Goodness Sake
Honest,Mum
Wake me up in the middle of
the night like this
But,Mom,I saw the whole..
If you don't stop I'm going to have to
 take a hairbrush to you
-Please,Mum
-Tommy
With all the stories you tell us there is
no wonder you have nightmares.
-Nightmares?
-Yes, nightmares.
You had a bad dream
You're soaking wet
Go on and back to bed
But, Mum...
Go to sleep like a good boy
Go first and see if anyone is on the roof
It's all right
You stay here
Couldn't have been a nightmare.
My pillow.
-Did you hide him?
-Yeah
-Suppose somebody finds him there?
-So what,they'll never trace him to us
Up already ?
I could not sleep,Mum, you
know why I couldn't
Everybody has nightmares,Tommy, but
people don't go around saying they are real
They'd getting into lot of trouble
Honest,Mum
Tommy,we won't hear anymore about it now
If you didn't have a nightmare,then
you are making up another story
And what should I say to
your father this morning
Remember he doesn't expect it
-Hello,dear
-Good Morning.
-Hi,Tom
-Good Morning,Pop
-What a nigh you had
-It was scorching
I'll have breakfast ready in just a minute
What's the matter with you?
You don't look like you went to bed
Don't think he got very much sleep
Pop
-I got something to tell you
-OK,sure
Something terrible happened last night
-You know the Kellerson upstairs?
-Yeah,I've seen them coming and going, why?
They killed a man.
Tommy.
Where ever did you get that idea?
I just slept on the fire escape,Pop
But it was so hot and
 climbed up to Kellerson..
That's how I saw them.
Pop,you got to believe me,
someone got to believe me.
He had a nightmare,last night
and he is all upset.
It wasn't a nightmare,and I'm not
making it up, I saw them!
Tommy,the Kellerson are nice people,
they never bother anybody
They just act that way,Mom,so you
 won't know anything about them
Tommy,how would you like
if someone run around
saying your Mum and I killed people?
But they did, I watched them
through the window.
Listen
I remember once years ago
when I was about your age,it was
a hot night, like last night.
I dreamed that the whole house was on fire.
I woke up screaming and yelling my head off
Mother and Dad came in,it took them
 quite a while to calm me down
And even after they talked to me
I still couldn't believe that
there hadn't been a fire.
They had to let me get up and look around
Now,do you see what I mean?
You see how real dreams can be?
Yes,Pop,I had dreams like that too
You can't expect to go upstairs
and ask the Kellersons if they have
 killed somebody,can you?
No,they'd run away
Come on now and sit down and have some
breakfast, you'll feel better
I am not hungry,Pop,not a bit
Maybe it'd better go and rest
a while until you feel like eating
Pop
If you see a thing with your own
 eyes,it can't be a dream,can it?
You don't want me to be
ever ashamed of you,do you?
No, Pop
Don't you see that might
happen if you keep this up?
People gonna say:
"Ed Woodry's son does not know
the difference between what
 is real and what isn't"
They might even say you're a liar.
But,Pop ...
Look,Tommy
I have got a lot of nice things planned
 for you when you grow up.
And I want you to live up to
 it by being honest now
A father wants to be
proud of his son,Tommy
There is nothing that would 
give more pleasure
than be walking down the street
someday and have somebody say
"There goes Tommy Woodry's father".
But if you got to get all mixed
 up the way you are now
I do not know what we we are going to do
I'm sorry, Pop
I am very tired,Tommy,
I'm going to get some rest
I want you to stay in your room today
And think over what I
 told you very carefully
I'll talk again before I go to work tonight
I do not know what's the matter with him
Tommy,you know your father
has to work hard for us, don't you?
Yes, Mum.
And he can't work,when he is upset
I know.
Then why don't you try to
help us by behaving yourself
Mum,Pop don't want to lie, does he?
Of course not
If I said it wasn't true
about the Kellerson
that it was all a lie,then I'll be doing
What Pop doesn't want me to do
I'll be lying.
If someone had really murdered,
somebody,liked you say
Then the police would know about it,
that's their business,Tommy
-That's right,Mom,that is their business
-Certainly
Now I will call your Pop
before he goes to work
And you can tell him that everything
 you said about the Kellerson wasn't so
No, Mum,don't
Because that would be lying
 and Pop do not want me to lie
We are both too easy on you,Tommy
Don't get mad at me,Mum
Now you'll going to stay in this room,and
I mean without your lunch or your dinner
Until you decide to give in,and let
your father and me have some peace
Pardon me,Sir
I want to report a murder I saw last night
-If that's's so,look,what's your name?
-Tommy Woodry.
-I went out to the fire escape last night..
-Hold on,hold on
-What's your address?
-225 Bolt Street
I went to our fire escape last night and I
wanted....
Wait a minute...,just a minute
You go down that hallway
to a door marked Detectives
You go in there and tell them all about it
What do you want,boy?
It's about a murder,Sir
-Who sent you in here?
-The man at the desk outfront
I saw a man murdered last night
-What's your name?
-Tommy Woodry.
I was looking through the window
-Address?
-225 Holt street
-Where did you see this man murdered?
-Upstairs where I live
Go on.Mr and Mrs Kellerson did it Sir
There was a man they were stealing from
You know the people that did it
What are they like?
They don't look like a murderers
They don't?
Son,did you ever had nightmares,
bad dreams that scare you?
Yes,Sir, lots of times.
But not this time, this was real.
Come son,tell us what you saw.
I went out on my fire escape last night
And I wanted to go above
me because it was cooler there
I fell asleep and when I woke up,
I looked through the window.
The sheet was up a little bit so I
 couldn't not see everything.
There was a fight
And somebody took some scissors,
and they stabbed this man in the back
I though you said you
couldn't see everything?
 I couldn't but
Then how do you know they
 stabbed him in the back?
I saw him when he fell on the floor.
There was blood on his back
 and he was dead.
Have you ever turned in any fire alarms?
You know,just to get a little
excitement stirred up?
No,Sir,never.
Did you tell your parents about this?
Yes,Sir
Why didn't they come and tell us about it?
Speak up,son,why didn't
they tell us about it?
They didn't believe me
Why didn't they believe you?
They think I always making things up
They do?
-Are you always making things up?
-Sometimes
But I am not going to any more
You know son it's a pretty serious thing
 to make something like this up,don't you?
Yes, Sir, I know that
I'm not making it up
I guess it wouldn't hurt anything to run
 over there and have a look around
All right
-Where do they live son?
-225 Holt Street.
On the fifth floor,right 
upstairs where I live
Remember this is not an official,
so don't go sticking your neck out
Get into their apartment on some pretext
 or other and see what you can find out
Go,along son,he'll see
that you get home safely.
-I can't go home
-Why not?
Maybe they found out,that
 I know, they'll kill me too
Don't worry about that son
Nobody is going to kill you
-Not with me going to take care of you
-No,please,I'm afraid
Son,don't be afraid,Mr Ross will
take good take care of you.
Come on.
-I can't go in the proper way
-Why not?
We'll take me back at the fire escape
Oh,no we go right to see your
mother,and not on any fire escape.
Come on
Here it is,thanks a lot
Now I think we better see
 if your mother is home
Yes?
Howdy,Mrs Woodry I'm bringing
 your boy back from the police station
-Police station
-Nothing to get alarmed about
He had quite a wild story to tell us
.
and we thought we'd better come
over and see what is was all about
Tommy,you didn't tell them
Please don't pay any attention to him,
he is always making up stories
If it is not Indians,it's gangsters,if it
 isn't gangsters something else
-Someone is always getting killed
-Born story teller,eh
I don't know what we are
going to do with him
We nearly lost our apartment
yesterday because of one of his tales
And now the Kellerson.
They are really very nice people
I didn't make it up about the Kellersons!
I saw them!
Quiet,haven't you done enough for one day?
You know,if I were you,Mom,
 I'd talk to his teacher
-Yes,yes
-Maybe even a doctor
We'll have to do something
Meantime I certainly would
keep an eye on him.
Yes I will,I'll promise you that.
-Thank you for bringing back
-Not at all,Good Bye
See what it is
Go on,don't act suspicious, open the door
Open it wide
-Good morning
-Hello.
Sorry to bother you,Madam,I'm Mr. Proctor
 We are making an estimate answer
 of repairs in the building
 I wonder if you mind if I looked
over the apartment
-I haven't had a chance
-Come in ,come in
There is plenty needs doing
All right it's pretty messy,please
don't pay too much attention to it
-Good Morning.
-Good Morning
That's about time they got to
around cleaning these places up
Yes, I find most of the apartment
 in pretty bad shape
Look at that fixture,never
worked since we been here
And the bedroom they have ain't
been painting since the place was built
Pretty grubby ain't it
The wall papers fallen off the wall
I remember one time we tored the paper off
we found a couple of hundred
dollar bills behind it
Confederate money
The roof's been leaking for
 a long time,it ruined the rug
Every time it rains, the
water just pours in
I'll take a look at that when I get on top
-Any more rooms?
-Another bedroom in there
Guessed that's do it folks,
I think I got everything
When they get around fixing it?
I know it is hard to say,
this is only an estimate
We turn in our bid but I'm
 not even sure we'll get the job
If we do, we'll take care of that for you
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.
What kind of scare,Joe
What for?
-He doesn't know anything.
-Anyway I was scared.
Please, Mum!
I don't care if you like it or not,
you're going to apologize
It's going to teach you a lesson,young man
-Please,Mom, no!
-Come on
-Hello.
-Excuse me, Mrs Kellerson.
Tommy has something he
 wants to say to you
Well what is it?
Tommy!
Anything wrong Mrs Woodry?
He's been a very bad boy
Doesn't look like a bad
 boy, what did he do?
Since he won't tell you,he has making
 up stories about you and your husband
Terrible things
and I've brought him up here to
apologize to try to teach him a lesson
Stories?
What kind of stories,Tommy?
Go ahead tell her what you said.
No.
Never mind,Mrs Woodry, don't be upset
I know how little boys are,he'll grow up
I certainly hope so
I do not know what we are going
 to with him in the meantime though
Don't worry about him
-How is your sister getting along?
-She is much better, thank you.
That's good
You ought to be ashamed over yourself
 humiliating me in front of her like that
I was going to let you go outside now you
 are going to stay in your room all day
Now she knows that I saw them!
-They'll kill me too
-Tommy stop that
If you go out of that window again,
young man, you'd really be sorry
I won't, Mum.
There is no place for me to go
You're getting excited about nothing
-The kid knows something.
-What does he know?
He didn't see us,nobody did
How can you be sure Joe,he might
had been on the fire escape?
I've seen him playing on there lots of time
It was late
He wouldn't be out that hour
He must have told them something
 why would she want him to apologize
All right
You see the only way we could do is
to find out exactly what he knows.
But how?
A way to catch him alone
and I'll have a talk with him
A way to catch him alone?
What do you want me to do, going down
there when his mother and father there?
-Of course not.
-All right,we'll wait.
I'll think of something
False alarm.
Kid's mother says he is always
 making up stories
Got them in a jam yesterday,
they almost lost their apartment
-What about the Kellerson?
-A perfectly ordinary pair
Went through the whole place
-Did you see anything unusual?
-Not a thing
Funny what imagination would do though
I saw some stains on the floor,turned out
 to be the place where the roof leaked
Suppose we were lucky we
 didn't make it official.
-How did you get in?
-Said I was an estimator
Say if any more kids turn up with stories,
 will you send Dorsey,out with them
I do not know anything
 about interior decorating
Aren't you going to eat?
-I'm sorry,Pop, I'm not hungry.
-That's not good,son
Drink your milk,Tommy
Did you stay in your room all day?
-I don't want to lie,Pop.
-Did you?
No, Pop
Where did you go?
I went to the police,and told them
about the Kellerson.
That's what I wanted to tell you after it
 I didn't want to spoil your supper
Sneaked out of the room
without my knowing about it
Police only brought him back again,
naturally they wouldn't believe him
Yes?
This telegram was delivered to
our apartment by mistake
I thought it might be important.
Thank you,Mrs Kellerson
It's from Uncle Charlie, Helen is worse.
I'll have to get over there
 right away,they will need me
Take me with you,Mum
I can't take you with me Tommy
Aunt Helen can't stand children
 around when she is so sick
Besides I might to have to stay all night,
and if I do there wouldn't be room for you
-Please,you can't go
-Why not?
It's only a trap, the Kellerson
 have sent that telegram
Oh Tommy!
Mum,you got to listen to me,
 you got to believe me!
Tommy why do you act up like this
when you know how worried your mother is
Mum,you can not leave me alone.
He must be sick,Eddie,he must be
Acting like this not eating all day
-They'll kill me
-Tommy!Tommy
Look here
What makes you think that
 this telegram is a trick?
I know it
They know that Mum got a sick sister
 and they know you work night
They want to be left here alone.
If could prove to you that Uncle
 Charlie really sent this telegram
Then would you stop all this nonsense
of about the Kellersons and
admit your are wrong? Would you?
-Yes, Pop
-Good
Then in some way we will prove to
 that the telegram is real
Suppose we go to the drug store and call up
 Uncle Charlie,you can talk to him yourself
Ask him if he sent it
-How does that sound?
-OK,Pop
Swell, come on.
Tommy and I decided that
 we better phone Uncle Charlie
just to make sure he sent the telegram
All right
Guess I should call him first anyway
Hello Charlie, this is Mary.
Yes, I have got it, how is she?
I am on my way over now but listen,
will you talk to Tommy?
He has something he wants to
 ask you.He is right here
Hello,Uncle Charlie
Did you really send that telegram to Mum?
Nothing, I just wondered
Here she is
Hello,Charlie
-Did you talk to him?
-Yeah
Did he send the telegram?
Now you're satisfied?
Will you let mother go 
without making any more trouble?
You won't be afraid anymore,will you?
-No, Mum.
-That's a good boy
It's still early but I might 
just as well walk get to work
I can ride away with the other bus
Tommy said he would be a 
good boy now,Ed
He's going to behave himself
If you want your supper the
 plate is in the Owen
Thanks Mum
You stay in the house tonight,Tommy
You're not very well
and I don't want to be worried about
 you,while your mother is gone
OK, Pop
You can get your own breakfast if I'm not
 back in the morning,can't you?
Yes Mum.
Oh Tommy!
-See you in the morning
-Bye,Pop
Dear Mum and Pop:
"I know I've been a lot of 
troble to you and I am sory"
"I love you both, but I'm 
going to run away"
"GoodbyTommy"
PS
"What I said about
the Kellerson was truth"
What are you up to?
It's a good thing I decide to come back
and see that you are all right, otherwise
 you'll be out on the streets again
-I'm Sorry, Pop
-And I am too,Tommy
You're forcing me to do
 something I dislike very much
If I didn't have to go work
I'd stay here myself and see that 
you didn't get into any trouble
But I can't do that
So I am going to see to it that
 you are going to stay in this room.
Please,Pop,don't!
I wouldn't none if you give me any
 reason to believe that I could trust you
Take me to work with you,Pop,
I won't be in your way,honest,I won't
Tommy,your mother and I are
 very worried about you
Tomorrow morning,first thing
we're going to take you and see a doctor
 find out what's matter with you
I'll try to get of as soon as I can
You're staying in this
 room until I come back
Good night,Tommy
So he's leaving?
Better wait a while and make sure
Five to two
We waited long enough.
Where is the pass key?
You go down the fire 
escape,take this with you
What I said about Kellersons
was the truth
Hello Tommy.
You'll be quiet if you
 don't want to get hurt
What's matter with you,Tommy?
Don't you like me?
Have I ever done
 anything to you?
What are you running 
around telling stories for?
-They are not stories
-Oh no?
Maybe if you told me what 
they were I could explain
I don't want you thinking
 these terrible things
What is you think I did?
You know what you did
But I don't
I don't know what are you talking about?
Now come on,Tommy,let's be fair
You can't accuse me of something 
without telling me what it is
You killed somebody
Come on,Tommy,you 
don't really believe that
I was out on the fire escape.I saw you
You sure you didn't imagine it?
No, I saw everything
the scissors and the man
Tommy, if you really believe that
I think there is only 
one thing we can do
Go to the police,and tell them about it
You haven't been to the 
police already,have you?
No.
All right then,I tell you what we do
We'll go down to the 
police station right now
I don't want you to believe in these things
 about me, we want to be friends
Maybe the police will convince you.
Jean,Tommy and I am 
going down to the police station.
The police station?
Yes,there is something we 
want to straighten out
-But Joe...
-You can come along with us
Come on,Tom
Do you know which way it is Tommy?
-Yeah,I think it's out this way
-Let's go
You know I'll be glad when we get
 this whole straightened out,won't you?
I think we gone far enough
Very ashamed of you,Tommy,
you get in and behave yourself
225 Holt street
Let me out!
-Joe,we can't go back there.
-We got no choice
Had to get him off the
 streets.Let me handle this
Help!
Help, police!
Help!
Help, police!
-What's the trouble?
-They are going to kill me
It's going to get when we come
 home tonight,that's what's the trouble
And you can holler at all the policeman you
 want,you young man,and that won't save you
He even once started a false alarm to 
keep me from giving him him a smack
A good licking never hurt anybody,boy
My old man used to give me
 enough of them when I was a kid
Still in all,I never thought of 
calling the cops when he did
They killed a man,last night,
honest,they did!
Tommy!
I was at the window I saw they kill him!
Say,are you the kid who was there
 on the station house this morning
and claimed he saw a murder?
Yes, that was me.
What? You went bothering them too
Tommy that's the last straw
Oh it wasn't so bad
Nobody paid any attention to him
It was bad enough,and he's going
 to get plenty when I get him home
Don't worry,son,maybe it won't be too bad
They're not my parents,please!
I had enough of this
Get over here
Let me alone!
Can you beat it
After he's giving us all that
 trouble he's gone to sleep
-Just like my kid,my do it all the time
-Yeah
You'd better carry him,
Joe,so he don't wake up
Sure can wear themselves out
-Ain't he cute,though?
-Yeah
Tommy?
Tommy!
What ever are we going to do with him?
We got to figure out for 
Tommy to have an accident
Pardon me,Officer.
Have you seen a little boy about
so high,he is nine years old,
Has dark hair and light complexion
-No,I haven't,how long has he been gone?
-I don't know
I came home early,from work tonight,
because I've been worried about him
He's been acting kind of funny all day
And when I got home he was gone
He left me this note.
Said he was going to run away 
from home,I know better than that
Can't imagine what's happened to him
Kids do funny things.
Don't worry about him
I'd call and get some help,
we'll find him for you
Patrol man Delaneyl leaving 
his post to look for a missing boy
I'd like to have a radio car,help me
-Will you send it over to..
-225 Holt Stret
225 Holt Street I'll meet them there
Put out the light
-Joe,we can't do that
-What's the matter
Plays out here all the time
Said so yourself
You're going to be all right
all right,let's it happen
-He is not here yet
-Was he here all alone?
Yes,mother had to go over
 to her sister tonight
Would you mind 
waiting here a minute?
No,not at all
We cannot do it Joe.
I thought maybe I could find him upstairs
I'll bet I know where he is,
on his way over to his mother
Let me have my boys take you over
 there,you'll probably run right into him
-Is he in here?
-Yes
There is no stairs past the third floor
Help, Pop!
Help!
Pop!!
Stay Back! Leave me alone!
Let me live!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Police Department
237 Holt street
237 Holt street, report back
Stand aside, stand aside folks
What's the trouble?
-Condemned building collapse
-Anybody hurt?
One fellow killed,still somebody
 up on the third floor
There's a kid trapped up in the 
rafters,they are trying to get him down
Tommy.
Get back here
I wouldn't get up if I were you
Come on.Get back here
Get back
Don't move son
Hold as still as you can.
We'll have some help in a minute
Don't let him see us
Come on boys, hurry up!
We don't have time to get a ladder in
But here is a mat I 'll 
throw the light on it
Can you see it?
Do you see it now?
Look down here.
Sit up very carefully
And do just as I tell you
Do not move the beam.
Easy now
Keep your eyes open, keep your
 hand and feet close together
When I count three,jump
Are you ready?
One
Two
Three.
Jump!
Hurry! Jump!
-Are you all right?
-Sure Pop.
Are you hurt?
Stand back Please let them out
Wait, Pop!
The man they just carried
 out was Mr Kellerson.
And his wife is trapped
 there in the building,
And if you still don't believe me
the man they killed up there
 in a closet,honest,Pop
Maybe we better get down to headquarters
 and get this story straightened out
Move back folks,let them out
All right break it up.
Let them through
That's all the truth.
Will you have some job,son.
Yes, but I know one thing 
I'll never gonna be a fire man
 I don't like jumping in those nets
I'm proud of you,Tommy
And from now on I'll promise I believe you
I'm glad,Pop
And from now on, I promise I'll 
never make up another story
That will make us all happy.
I'll bet when we get down to the station a 
lot of guys going to point at me and say
"There goes Tommy Woodry's father"
