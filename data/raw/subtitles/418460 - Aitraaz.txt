Mop and dust it twice more.
Sir, is there some festival today?
Or is that some big client
 is supposed to come?
Today, at our... at my place, a
 young and beautiful girl is...
...gonna come for the interview
 for the post of secretary.
So, do as I say.
 - Yes, sir.
I just go exhausted while
 I tried to know about you.
Where's the telephone?
Hello.
Yes, brother, this is Rakesh.
You too so long to pick
 up the telephone?
I can pick it up only
 if I'm able to see it.
I don't know what is
 kept where over here.
Even I told you to
 find a maid for me.
Were you able to find her?
Raj, it's not difficult
 for me to find a maid.
But, when I tell them that
 you're a bachelor...
...and you stay alone, then they
 instantly take to their heels.
Yeah, as if I'll jump on them
 as soon they step in over here.
Won't I be able to find
 a maid if I'm a bachelor?
I called you up to tell the same
 thing that I've spoken to a maid.
Where's she?
She'll be at your place by 10:30.
Moreover, she's an educated girl.
She'll also handle your phone calls
 along with the household chores.
Hey, send her fast. I'm
 very much in trouble.
She's coming, man. She's coming.
Have you ever drunk foam mixed tea?
 - Nope.
I've just made it. Then,
 do come here and drink.
Man, I've drank cardamom
 tea many a times...
...but, what's this foam tea?
Hey, stop!
Will you break my limbs?
Damn fellow, do you want
 to kill me under the bus?
Neither they let to board
 the bus properly...
...nor they let to alight
 the bus properly!
If we stand, then the
 guys gather around.
They make a sandwich out of us.
They don't even give space to
 sit. Let me take up a job!
Let alone boarding a bus, I won't
 even look at the bus stop.
All the houses are alike over here.
How will I search that one?
Hello?
 - Hello, Mr. Sharma, how do you do?
Mr. Sharma, where have you sent me?
It seems that I'll myself
 get lost over here...
...then, how the hell will
 I find the house owner.
You haven't reached there yet?
I even gave you the address
 to write down.
I didn't write it. I thought there
 might be a couple of houses...
...and, I'll easily find it. But,
 all the houses in here are similar.
Fine. Listen then.
There's a Sai Baba
 temple over there.
That's behind me.
There's this lane right
 in front of it...
...and, the moment you
 reach there take a...
I got it. I got it.
 I'll call you later.
Hello!
How much?
 - 20 rupees.
O saint, I'm going for the
 interview for the first time.
I'm confident that I'll be
 selected in the interview.
Since, I'm able to see you
 before the interview.
I didn't ask him the house number.
Hello?
 - Hello, Mr. Sharma, how do you do?
Now, how will I find it since you
 haven't told me the house number?
You don't even listen
 to the whole thing.
You cut the phone quite early.
 Now, listen carefully.
It's bungalow no. 30.
I got it. I got it.
13 means one three. I
 do understand English.
13? 13? 13?
What was the house number?
I forgot the paper at home.
30.
Come in.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good mo...
Good morning.
 - I'm Priya Saxena.
Priya Sex...
Priya Saxena. Yes.
We spoke in the morning
 on the phone.
What did we speak about?
About the job?
 - Job?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
So, you've come for that job?
Do you know, isn't it, as
 to what all you've to do?
Yes, sir. Whatever you say.
 - Good.
Make a cup of tea.
Sir...
What happened? Don't
 you know to make tea?
Yes, I do know.
Kitchen is there.
What happened?
Let it be. Do it later.
 - Fine.
Do it later.
So, what experience do you've?
What are you talking
 about experience?
I'm doing this work
 since many a years.
Even my parents used
 to do the same thing.
Actually, it's our
 family profession.
That means, I don't have
 to explain you anything?
Not at all.
By the way, who else
 is in your house?
It's just me and this Bunty.
And, your wife and kids?
Actually, I'm still a bachelor.
Very good.
I enjoy working at bachelor's
 and lonely men's house.
The women folk just
 keep on nagging...
...and I really get pissed off.
 - Exactly.
You've made nice tea.
 - Thanks a lot.
You seem to be quite educated.
 - Yes, sir.
BA with distinction. And,
 I've just passed LLB.
My certificates.
It seems that unemployment
 has increased.
What?
 - No.
I meant, you've such a
 good qualification...
...and yet you want to do this job?
Sir, I don't regard
 any job as small.
And, it's a big honour for
 me to work under you.
And, I'll get learn a lot from you.
Fine. If you really want to
 do this job, then do it.
But, I can give you 1500
 rupees per month.
1500?
But, you wrote 3000 in the ad.
 - Ad?
Just think about it, sir.
The secretary to such
 a big lawyer and...
Lawyer?
 - I mean barrister.
The secretary to such
 a big barrister and...
...the salary is just 1500 rupees.
I was just having fun.
What did I mention in
 the ad? 3000, isn't it?
I'll pay you 3000.
Sir, am I fix? - You fix. The
 job fix. And, we are all fix.
Thank you so much, sir.
 - That's great.
So, should I leave?
 - Yeah.
Listen.
I'll have the morning
 tea at 9 o'clock.
Okay, sir. I'll be here at 8:45.
That's great.
 - Bye. Bye.
So, the job is agreed
 for on my behalf.
I'll take 1500 rupees as salary.
 And, not a penny less!
You'll take only 1500? - Sir,
 what's there to do in your house?
Why will you do the household work?
 Bunty is there for it.
Bunty will do my work?
Look, neither Bunty
 will do your work...
...nor you'll do Bunty's work.
Then, it's fine.
But, one thing more.
I'll work from morning
 7 till 9 at night.
And, I'll sleep in the bedroom.
In the bedroom? Whose?
In my own. You'll have
 to give me a bedroom.
As I won't sleep in the
 kitchen or the balcony...
...with the mattress spread out.
You mean... You'll stay here?
If I work at your place
 then am I supposed to...
...stay at the neighborÂ’s place?
 You talk very strange.
Okay.
Bunty, where do you sleep?
I won't sleep with Bunty.
Adjust it for a single
 night and then...
...I'll arrange everything
 for you tomorrow.
Don't you feel ashamed?
You're telling a girl to
 sleep in a boy's room.
No. No. He's not a boy. He's a kid.
That's why I don't
 want to sleep him.
Do you know, there's no
 case filed on the kids.
Wow! That's great. I'm
 really impressed.
You've a sound knowledge
 of the law. - Yes.
I was in search of a similar talent.
Now, you go home and
 bring you baggage...
...and, your room will be arranged.
I'll go right away and
 come right away.
Thank you, sir. Bye.
Good morning.
 - Good morning.
Morning, Hussain.
 - Morning, Raj.
How are you?
 - Fine. Are you all right? - Yeah.
Where's my file?
 - Here it is.
Thank you.
 - All the best.
Thank you. Good morning, sir.
 - Morning.
Morning, Jenny.
Good morning, sir.
I want to see you in the
 conference right now.
Yes, sir.
 - Come.
The design and features
 of our new handset RX49...
...are indeed quite good.
And, now I want to know as
 to what are it's results...
...and when will it be able
 for a launch in the market?
So far, all our tests
 have been positive.
And, only the test of this handset
 is on a trial basis.
It's features, frequency, voice
 quality and battery life...
...are still under observation.
So far, we've made around
 50 handsets...
...and distributed among our staff.
And, as soon as the result comes,
 we'll be able to say...
...as to when we can it be
 launched in the market.
Whatever the progress is,
 please inform us.
Okay, sir. Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.
 - Thank you, sir.
I knew it from the first that
 this maid is definitely...
...gonna create some problem.
But, the one who came in her place...
...didn't you tell her anything?
I mean, that you don't want
 a secretary but a maid.
Am I mad to tell her that?
So that she leaves the job.
I don't want her ever
 to go away from me.
No problem if she stays
 as a secretary.
Of for that matter a maid.
I simply want that she
 be always close to me.
She shouldn't go far from me.
I got it. I got your whole game.
But, just think, what if she comes
 to know that you're not a barrister?
And, that your family is not
 even distantly related...
...to the law and the court...
...then what is gonna happen,
 my brother?
I don't know what to do.
You give me some idea.
You do one thing.
In order to keep her
 there in your house...
...you act as a lawyer for some days.
And, when you find the opportunity...
...then, lovingly express the
 feeling of your heart to her.
Here. Take whichever book you want.
By the way, if you want some
 advice for some case...
...then, you can take it from me.
 It's 100% discount for you.
No, Chotlani sir, I was just
 taking these for reference.
To increase my general knowledge...
 Here. Have some snacks?
Raj, she's Kanchan.
He's Raj. Our neighbour.
How do you do?
 - Fine. Thank you.
Thank you.
I was saying that just finish
 of these drinks...
...and, I'll serve the dinner.
Brother, you too go after eating
 the food cooked by me.
Mr. Chotlani, who's she?
 - She's my secretary.
I employed her today itself.
And, you're making her prepare
 snacks from now itself?
No, Raj. She's in habit
 of these things.
Preparing the snacks, cooking
 the food, sweeping the house.
I gave her a letter to
 type in the afternoon...
...and she said, 'How
 funny you're being? '
Well, she's willing to
 work for 1500 rupees.
And, I gave the ad for 3000 bucks.
I got it. - What?
That you got a maid and a
 secretary in 1500 bucks.
You just don't let her go.
 That's it. - Done.
Catch hold of her.
 I am living sir. - Okay.
And, return these books soon.
 I can need them any moment.
Yeah, but just don't let her go.
 - Okay.
She has come.
Come in.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.
Sir, I'm exactly on time.
 I'll make the tea for you.
I've had the tea. You
 better have a seat.
Sir, are you searching a
 reference for some case?
Yeah. It's a bit complicated case.
Should I help you, sir?
No, no. Today is your first day.
I don't want you to involve
 yourself in such a complicated case.
I'll solve it.
And, I'll give you a straight
 and simple case.
You better work on it. Fine?
This case is a very important case.
Tell me, sir?
Yeah, write it down.
There's a friend of mine,
 Raj Malhotra.
Raj is an engineer.
When he was alone, then he could...
...neither take care of himself
 nor he of the house.
He thought of employing a maid.
I mean a housemaid.
A girl arrived. And,
 Raj employed her.
Now, the problem is,
 the girl was going...
...to someone else's house
 for the secretary's job...
...but, by mistake she arrived
 at Raj's house...
...and, Raj employed her.
Sir, your friend shouldn't
 have done that.
He should have sent her back
 giving her the right address.
He made an educated
 girl into a maid?
No, Priya. It's not like that.
Actually, he found the girl nice.
He felt that if the girl
 comes in this house...
...then the house too
 would turn nice.
In this house?
I mean, in Raj Malhotra's house.
That means, love at first sight.
 - Exactly.
Now, this was the case
 of Raj Malhotra.
Just think what might be
 the girl's reaction...
...if she comes to know about it.
Will she file a case against Raj?
Or will both them reach an
 out of court settlement.
Just think.
Fine, sir. I'll think
 over both the points.
Great. I'll leave for the office.
 - Office?
I mean, I'll leave for the court.
It's my hearing today. And,
 if any call comes for me...
...then do attend it. Okay?
 - Okay, sir.
And, these are some law books.
 So, refer from them.
Fine.
Don't just apply your mind to
 this case but also your heart.
Of course, sir. - Fine?
Take care. - Okay.
Raj. - Yes?
Where's Raj?
 - Who's Raj?
Raj Malhotra.
 - Raj Malhotra?
Don't you know Raj Malhotra?
 - I do know.
He's Mr. Chotlani's friend.
 - Correct.
So, where's he? - I don't know.
 He might be at his house.
Hold it. Hold it.
So, whose house is it?
 Who stays over here?
Barrister Ram Chotlani stays here.
Ram Chotlani?
You mean to say that
 I stay over here?
I eat and drink and sleep
 in bungalow number 13...
...and I pay all it's phone bills,
 tax bills and municipal bills...
...and I stay over here?
You're Mr. Chotlani?
 - Yes.
And, I don't stay here but there.
Raj Malhotra stays here.
Wait.
Last night he brought some
 law books from my house.
I've come to take them back.
 A client has come.
Should I take them? Thank you.
Oh my God! Look here.
He keeps the law books along
 with the waste papers.
And, you think of him as
 Barrister Ram Chotlani?
Wow! Wonderful!
Nice to meet you.
Relax.
There's a friend of mine,
 Raj Malhotra.
Raj is an Engineer.
He thought of employing a maid.
Then he kept a girl.
Do you know, isn't it, as
 to what all you've to do?
Don't just apply your mind to
 this case but also your heart.
Actually, he found the girl nice.
He felt that if the girl
 comes in this house...
...then the house too
 would turn nice.
That means, love at first sight.
 - Exactly.
Love at first sight.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Priya.
Today, our house doesn't
 seem to be ours.
There was no client or any
 phone call since morning.
And as I was free so I thought
 why not clean the house.
It doesn't look like
 a bachelor's house.
Sir, you had a case in the court...
...what happened to it?
Which case?
Oh! That case. My client
 got the degree.
And, you very well know, there's
 no question of defeat.
My arguments sealed the public
 prosecutor's mouth.
He was glad.
And, he said to me to
 occupy his chair.
I said, 'Brother, why are you
 making fun of a junior? '
So did you think about my friend's
 case that I gave you?
Oh! That case!
Sir, I applied my heart
 and mind to that case.
It's a big problem.
The girl can file a fraud case.
Sir, there's no way that your
 friend Raj Malhotra could be saved.
What? There's no way?
Sir, it's not in the court.
Maybe, there is, if an out of
 court settlement is reached.
How come?
Look, girls like people
 who are truthful.
So, if you tell your
 friend to tell the...
...whole truth to that
 girl then the problem...
This is the problem. The poor
 guy isn't able to say anything.
Why? Is he mute?
He's not mute. Rather he
 doesn't have the courage.
Okay. If he doesn't
 have the courage...
...then, tell him to do one thing.
Tell him to write down
 a confession letter.
And, you can handle the rest
 on your friend's behalf.
This is the right idea.
 Very good. Very good.
You do one thing. Take the pen
 and paper and start writing.
Yes. Sit down. Sit down fast.
Write... Miss Priya...
Miss Priya, her name is also Priya.
When I saw you for the first time...
...my gaze just froze at your sight.
And, I couldn't decide, whether
 you had come to me...
...for the job of a housemaid
 or a barrister's secretary.
It's just that I kept you.
I dreaded that if I
 tell you the truth...
...then, you might leave
 me and go away.
Because I need you.
Maybe, I've gone through
 love at first sight.
And, if I've hurt you,
 then do forgive me.
Sir... Should I write,
 Yours Raj Malhotra?
Yeah. Write Raj Malhotra.
What do you think?
If that girl reads this letter,
 then will she resign...
...or will she accept Raj Malhotra?
Had I wanted to resign then
 I could have gone away...
...with Barrister Ram
 Chotlani, when...
...he came to take
 away his law books.
And, I wouldn't have sat here and...
...wrote the love letter
 of Raj Malhotra.
That means...
You know everything?
Yes.
That means you don't have
 any objection to accept me?
Not at all.
Not at all?
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
Every style of yours if quite
 different from the others.
And hence, I'm going
 gaga over you.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
O beloved, please do tell.
That I'm only but yours.
And, indeed the steps are going
 astray in the path of love.
O beloved, please do tell.
That I'm only but yours.
And, indeed the steps are going
 astray in the path of love.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
You made me go crazy
 at the first instance.
And, O sweetheart, I was
 spell-bounded at your face.
You made me go crazy
 at the first instance.
And, O sweetheart, I was
 spell-bounded at your face.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
Every style of yours if quite
 different from the others.
And hence, I'm going
 gaga over you.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
It's gone. Yes, the heart is gone.
As, I've found someone.
Enough. Enough. Stop it
 before the shore arrives.
Now, we'll walk from over here.
 - Why?
C'mon. I want to give
 you a surprise.
C'mon. Get ready for the surprise.
C'mon. Happy?
Put the left leg first.
 - What's the need of this parade?
C'mon, put it.
Left right.
 - Left right.
Left right.
 - Left right.
Always ready for a fight.
 - Left right.
It's a boy!
Boy?
Had you put the left foot first
 then it would have been a girl.
You mean to say...
Yes. Seven months later, your
 son will be in my lap.
I just can't believe you.
I love you, Priya. I love you.
You've given me everything in
 my life. - I love you too.
Now, I too will give you a surprise.
But, there's no need of
 a left right for that.
We've to just walk straight.
How did you find this bungalow?
 - Too beautiful.
Isn't it? Come.
Now, tell me, how does this
 bungalow look from over here?
Beautiful.
But, whose bungalow is this?
Right now, it's belong
 to the builder...
...but, it will belong
 to us in a day or two.
What? - We're purchasing
 this bungalow?
Congratulations, Raj.
Your loan has been sanctioned.
Now, you can take this bungalow's
 possession in a day or two.
Take this property papers. - By
 the way, this is Priya. My wife.
And, this is Amar. A very
 good friend of mine.
He's a manager in HDFC and
 he was instrumental...
...in the sanction of our loan.
Sister-in-law, tell me, how
 do you find this bungalow?
Very nice.
 - Good.
Okay, Raj. Then, I'll take a leave.
Wish you all the best.
 - Thank you very much.
Bye.
Raj, what's the cost of this
 bungalow? - 3 crores.
3 crores?
But, Raj, all your salary will
 go away in monthly installments.
Priya, I haven't taken
 a loan of 3 crores.
I have done some savings in my life.
And, I've given that to the
 builder as an advance.
That means, you've invested all
 your bank balance in this bungalow?
You don't worry. I have taken
 every step carefully.
Look, next week it's the annual
 day of our company.
And, I'll be given the post of
 Chief Executive Officer that day.
That means, Raj Malhotra
 will become the CEO.
What?
 - Yes.
And, my salary will
 get a foursome raise.
Moreover, I've some shares
 in the company.
This is indeed a great
 surprise, Raj.
But, this is nothing as compared
 to the surprise...
...that you gave me today
 in the morning.
I love you, Priya.
Congrats, sir.
 - Thank you.
Today you'll become the CEO.
 Will you give the party?
See here. The village hasn't
 been settled as yet...
...and, the dacoits have
 already come to loot him.
And, let the chairman come first.
 First let the announcement take place.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.
Welcome, sir.

Bye, bye. Come, darling.
One minute.
 - That was great, man.
Hello, sir.
 - Hello.
Excuse me, sir. Thank you very much.
I never expected that you'll
 give me such a big post.
I don't deserve that thank you,
 but my wife Sonia does.
That was her decision.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Roy.
Call me Sonia.
Thank you.
I hope that you'll carry on your
 past performance in the future.
And, you'll satisfy me and the
 company in the same way.
Of course.
See you at the party, young man.
 - Yes, sir.
Come.
Mr. Khanna, if a man has brain...
...then, he can verily sell his pain.
It's the thing that people,
 let alone buy...
...are not even ready
 to take a look at.
What else do I've other than brain?
The businessman who
 doesn't have brain...
...will definitely sink his company.
Hi. Hi.
My wife Priya. Our new MD...
 - Sonia.
Hello.
Your wife is indeed
 very beautiful, Raj.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good evening, sir.
 - Good evening, Raj. Good evening.
Sir, my wife Priya.
 - Hello.
And, the chairman of
 our company, Mr. Roy.
Nice meeting you. Enjoy the party.
 Thank you. - Thank you, sir.
Darling, come, I'll introduce
 you to my old friends.
Excuse me.
Raj, why did Mr. Chairman
 call Sonia as darling?
Because, she is his wife.
What?
They both are husband and wife?
 - Don't you feel so?
No. I feel as if he's her father.
Cheers!
Cheers to the new director
 on the board of directors.
And, cheers to the new CEO.
 - Thank you.
All right.
Raj, what spell did
 you cast on the MD...
...that he made you the director
 instead of the company's CEO.
It's my personality. And it's the
 spell of it. And, it's been cast.
What a figure, man?
Neither a millimeter here
 nor a millimeter there.
The Lord Almighty might have
 made this hot thing...
...while sipping a cold coffee.
Just leave it, man.
What useless things
 are you blabbering?
Really?
There's no doubt that I find
 her sexy and attractive.
Don't you feel likewise? - No. -
I do feel. But, she's
 our boss' wife, man.
That's the point worth
 weeping, Raj...
...that she's the wife of
 a 70-75 year old man.
One must go and tell
 that old fellow...
...that even the Viagra won't
 work on him in this age.
What's the discussion, buddy?
Good evening, sir.
 - Good evening.
Sir, Rakesh was saying a lot
 many things in your praise.
My praise?
When was I doing that? Man, you're...
Why are you shying away
 from sir? Tell him.
No, sir. I simply keep
 talking crap.
Talking crap? So,
 let me hear it as well.
I was... I was actually...
Speak up. Tell me.
Sir, I was saying that you and
 Madam Sonia make a nice pair.
Is this crap?
I mean to say, madam Sonia
 is so beautiful. - And, me?
You...
You're very graceful, sir and very...
Energetic.
 - Yes, energetic.
And, you're very young.
I mean, it will take
 another 30-35 years...
...for you to complete the century.
Good evening, everybody.
Thank you so much
 for your attention.
This evening, this
 night and this sea.
Today, in this beautiful ambience,
 there's none...
...a boss over here and
 nor anyone an employee.
Today, all of us are one. So, come.
Let's make this beautiful
 evening more beautiful.
The wild waves of the ocean
 are waiting to engulf you.
So, ladies and gentlemen, brace
 yourself for the love.
When one falls in
 love with someone.
And, when the waves dash
 into each other.
When the storm rises in the sea.
Then, the subtle are the
 ones to get scared.
It's a quagmire.
 It's a quagmire.
We're in the midst
 of this quagmire.
But, yet we're lost somewhere
 in the quagmire.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship
 of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
We're in the midst
 of this quagmire.
But, yet we're lost somewhere
 in the quagmire.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship
 of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
When loves crosses its limits.
The pain begins to
 scale up the breath.
But if the pain is dewy and cool.
The body begins to
 burn and squirm.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship
 of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
If it's true love in the heart.
Then, the ship of love indeed
 crosses the sea storm.
The waves keep on coming and
 the waves keep on going.
And, they've no impact as
 they keep on getting hurt.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship
 of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
The motion of the waves
 is quite strange.
So, try to be careful, O beloved.
This journey of love seems
 to be in the dark.
So, I don't know why I'm
 scared of getting drowned.
And, dear, I shall sail the ship
 of my heart in this quagmire today.
And, I swear.
It's a quagmire.
It's a quagmire.
When one falls in
 love with someone.
And, when the waves dash
 into each other.
When the storm rises in the sea.
Then, the subtle are the
 ones to get scared.
It's good.
Tomorrow, we'll be shifting
 to our new house.
At least, we're getting
 rid of this rental place.
Are you done with the packing?
 - Yes.
Some big things are left, I'll
 pack them tomorrow morning.
Today, I wore the Sari
 for the first time.
How was I looking?
 - Cute. Glamorous.
For once I thought that I should
 abduct from over there.
But, then I thought that it's
 my own property. My own wife.
What if it was someone else?
She wouldn't have been
 ravishing like you.
Should I ask you one thing, Raj?
 - Yes.
Your Mrs. MD is young and
 beautiful and educated...
...then, why did she got married
 to an old man like Mr. Roy?
What have we got to do with it?
It's their personal matter.
 Forget it.
I didn't find her behavior
 and attitude quite nice.
You be simply concerned with
 your work in the office.
Oh my God! My keys?
Where did I drop them?
Oh, no! - What happened?
My keys are inside. Can you help me?
This car can be opened only by
 a car mechanic or a car thief.
And, I'm none among them.
If you wish, then I
 can give you a lift.
Don't get embarrassed.
You can take lift from someone else.
Because anyone can give lift
 to a beautiful girl like you.
And, I'm just one of them.
I didn't mean that.
I really didn't mean it like that.
Come. I'll drop you.
Here. Wear this.
 - Why? What's the need for it?
Those clothes are wet.
Take. And, my seat can
 get spoilt as well.
Are you Indian?
 - Yes.
Who else is in your house?
 - I live with a friend of mine...
...who has gone to Canada. So,
 right now I'm alone.
And, you?
I work in a company over here.
And, what do you do?
These days, I simply do exercises.
Tomorrow, I've an audition.
 If I'm selected in that...
...then, probably, I'll
 start working as well.
For which company?
MTN mobile phone. It's
 for their modeling.
Just take a left ahead.
That's it.
Well, the manners dictate that
 I should be calling you in...
...and I should be serving you tea...
...but, I've to go to
 the Yoga classes.
And, I'm already late.
And, I've to make a lot of preparations
 for the audition tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Tomorrow, you'll be selected.
 - Really? You think so?
I don't think so. I mean so.
So, if I'm selected tomorrow
 then I'll give you a treat.
Promise?
 - Promise.
Cool.
 - Bye.
T shirt.
Sorry.
Thank you. By the way, Raj.
 - Sonia.
Best of luck.
 - Thanks.
I am thinking about you, only you.
No, you can't miss me.
Because I have freedom
 with MTN.
Cut it.
Congratulations Miss Sonia
 you have been selected.
Selected! You mean? - Yes.
You have been selected, Sonia.
Because you have great style,
 amazing posture and top of it...
...you look stunning - Thank you.
Miss. Sonia this
 is Raj Malhotra...
...Marketing Executive
 Director of M.T.N.
Yeah, that's me. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Just see, opportunity is
 such a strange thing.
Yesterday, I went to such
 a beach wherein no one comes.
And, it's over there that my
 key remains inside my car.
And, I got a lift from you.
Now, what can we do if your career
 was to start through us?
It seems that you're
 my good luck charm.
But, your good luck charm hasn't
 forgotten that you've...
...promised to give a treat
 after your selection.
Do you remember it?
 - That's right.
Sure?
 - Done. Good.
That should be okay.
 Enjoy the drink, sir.
Thank you.
 - Thank you.
This is for your success.
No. It's for our friendship.
Wanna dance?
 - Why not?
You're the fragrance
 and you're the magic.
You're the fragrance
 and you're the magic.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you.
You're the fragrance
 and you're the magic.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you.
I never had an idea, O sweetheart...
...that the heart might get crazy.
And, the spell of desire
 might work on me as well.
You're quite interesting.
As your memories
 occur quite often.
I have no more control on myself.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you, baby.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you.
What's that attraction in you as
 none is as beautiful as you.
And, this pain of detachment
 is intolerable.
The passion is all over the mind.
And, it's now that I'm
 feeling at peace.
I really want to seek you.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you, baby.
Hey, you, this heart's
 crazy over you.
Sonia. Sonia!
Sorry. Sorry.
There's such a nice buffet
 set at the pool side...
...and we've come here
 in this ruckus.
It's for a change, Raj. Oh, c'mon.
Can I have your order please?
 - Thank you.
It's a nice place.
 - Do you love it?
Yeah. Julie!
 - Hello, Ajay! How are you?
Two muppels and...
Raj, I'll just be back from the
 living room. - Yeah, sure.
And that should be okay.
Your drink, sir.
 - Thank you.
Sonia, what were you doing there?
Raj, do you know who he is?
 - I know.
His name is Ajay Singh.
 - Yes!
And, he has come to South
 Africa from India...
...to search for a brand ambassador
 for his product.
So, I deliberately attracted
 him towards me.
Now, you see, he'll himself
 come over here.
So, this was... Excuse me.
Ajay Singh.
 - HI! Sonia.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasure is all mine,
 beautiful lady.
Thank you.
He's my friend Raj.
 - Hello.
If your friend doesn't mind,
 then can I dance with you?
Of course. Why will Raj mind?
 - Come.
I've come here in search
 of a brand ambassador.
By the way, what do
 you think about me?
I guess, I've made my choice.
I like it.
What kind of behavior is this?
You came back from the hotel
 without informing me...
...and leaving me alone?
 - So, what did you want?
That I should have watched
 your dance with Ajay Singh?
What nonsense?
 - Just leave it.
Raj, I'm a model.
My degree and diploma are my beauty.
And, I've to just push them
 forth for success. That's it.
It's a part of our profession.
And, do you know, I got the
 contract for that single dance.
That means you can do anything
 for contract and money, right?
What do you mean by anything?
I'm not making a contract
 to sleep with him.
They need my body to promote
 their product...
...and they're ready to give
 me a price for it. That's it.
It's strictly professional!
But, I don't like all this.
 I can't see all this.
Raj, you've become completely
 possessive.
No matter wherever
 the Indian man is...
...no matter whatever he does...
...he'll always be an Indian.
Typical MCP. Male Chauvinist Pig.
But, you know what?
 I love it like that.
Hey, listen to me.
I love you. Truly. Honestly.
Take me.
You really love me, isn't it?
 - Of course.
And, you really want me to fulfill...
...all those dreams that I've
 seen so far, isn't it?
Yes, I want.
Then, let me sign the
 contract. Please.
They want to make me the brand
 ambassador of their company.
This is a very important
 step for my career.
Please. Please, Raj.
How will I refuse you if you
 ask me in such a position?
Wow! Look at this Indian model.
What a fantastic figure! She's
 really hot and sexy!
Man! So bold and so beautiful!
The one who has seen her photo...
...might be searching
 for her address.
Show me as well.
I'll be back.
Where are you going? At least
 keep the magazine and go.
I need it the most right now.
Maria, this is Raj here.
 Can I speak to Sonia?
She's gone to the hospital.
Between 5 to 10 minutes
 she'll be back at home.
Where is she?
 - She's upstairs.
Thank you.
Sonia, why did you
 go to the hospital?
I just went for a routine
 check-up, Raj.
But, the doctor told
 me that I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
This is good news. Why
 didn't you tell me?
This isn't some disease so that
 I should have told you.
We stay together and we didn't
 took any precautions...
...and it just happened.
By the way, there's nothing
 to worry about.
I've taken an appointment
 for tomorrow.
So, I'll go and get
 an abortion done.
Abortion? What's the
 need for abortion?
Sonia, we'll get married.
Raj...
I'm not getting an abortion because
 I'm having a child out of wedlock.
But, I'm having an abortion because
 I don't want a child...
...at this stage of my career.
What are you talking, Sonia? This
 is our love. This is our child.
But, this is not my ambition, Raj.
You very well know as after
 how many difficulties...
...I've got a chance to move ahead.
I've seen a world of different
 dream for myself.
Power, prestige, status, money...
I want to be on top
 of this world, Raj.
That means I don't have
 any value in your life?
And, you don't love me? - Who
 told you that I don't love you?
I love you very much and
 I'll do it forever.
But, I can't sacrifice my
 career at this stage.
Whatever it is, Sonia. You'll
 give birth to my child.
You're not going to abort the child.
You're talking as if
 you're my husband.
Raj this child is mine.
 It's inside me.
And, what has to be done with it...
...it's only me, who can decide that.
I've just stepped on the first
 ladder of my success.
And, there are many a ladders
 ahead, wherein I can't be...
...able to step with the burden
 of children and marriage.
That means, till today
 you just regarded me...
...as a ladder to your success?
And, you don't need me.
A successful woman doesn't
 need anyone, Raj.
She can keep her success
 as her husband...
...and, can also play
 with it as a child.
Then, there's a lot of difference
 between our thoughts.
You'll definitely get success.
Success can never evade
 a woman like you.
You want to go on the top
 of this world, isn't it?
Go.
But keep one thing in mind.
When you look down from over there...
...then, you won't find
 anyone as your own.
Just remember my word.
Raj!
Child, you did a great thing
 by buying your house.
How long could you've stayed
 in that rented place?
Here.
Live long. Prosper by
 the grace of God.
Come. Sit, papa. Mummy,
 you too sit down.
Yeah, child.
Come here, child.
 Yes, Sharma, tell me?
Raj, can you come to the
 office for a while?
Why? What happened?
That new handset
 of ours... RX49...
There's some problem
 in its functioning.
We could have discussed
 had you come over here.
It's very urgent, pal.
Fine. I'll come right away. Bye.
Priya.
 - Yes?
I'll have to go to the office?
 - Now?
Yeah, there's some important
 work. Okay?
Okay, mama. Okay, papa. See you.
 - Yeah, child.
Listen.
 - Yeah?
I've invited everybody
 for tonight's party...
...if someone is left out then
 do call and invite them.
Bye.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.
Tell Rakesh to come and
 meet me in my cabin.
And, why have you made this
 bird's nest on your head?
These are curls?
 - These are curls.
We met, separated, we met again.
 It's co-incidence.
But, this co-incidence is
 indeed nice. Love, Sonia.
Hi, Raj.
 - Hi.
What happened? What's problem
 with the handset?
Buddy, the handsets
 that we distributed...
...in our staff for the observation...
...some of them are
 complaining that...
...two numbers get connected
 at the same time.
What? - Yes, Raj. They said that
 when they dial a number...
...then the other number from
 the phone book gets dialed...
...all by itself and their call
 goes on a two way conference.
How can that happen?
Have you ordered for a check-up
 of the handset?
Sit. Yeah, man. I got
 everything checked...
...but, I'm unable to
 understand anything.
Really? Do this.
Just halt the production till
 the check-up of the handset.
Raj, it would have been proper
 to talk to madam Sonia...
...before halting the production.
 I mean...
That's right.
Yes. Please go through this
 contract. - Thank you.
You're welcome.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hello? - Madam, Mr. Raj Malhotra
 wants to meet you.
Tell him that he can come.
 - Yes, madam.
Excuse me, gentleman. An urgent
 meeting has come up.
Can we do this in another
 half an hour? - Okay.
Thank you.
Come in.
Hi, Raj.
 - Hi!
Please, have a seat.
I sent you some flowers.
 Did you get them? - Yes.
Thank you for the flowers.
And, there was a card along.
 Did you read it?
Yes. I read it.
Raj, I'm very much happy
 at your promotion, but...
...there's no excitement in you
 in regard to my congratulation.
Perhaps, you just saw
 and read my words.
But, you didn't feel them.
Sonia, the thing is...
That RX49 model of ours is having
 a technical problem...
...and I wanted to discuss something
 about it with you.
Should we discuss it now?
Oh! So, you just want to talk that?
 - Yeah.
But, I'm sorry. It will
 take a long time.
Our clients from the
 Asian zone have come.
And, a very important
 meeting is in progress.
Shall we discuss it later?
Should we make it after lunch?
You talk to my PA. He'll
 inform you about that.
Fine. Thank you.
Hello?
 - I am Bhagwat speaking. - Yes?
Madam had to go out for
 an urgent meeting.
She has called you home
 in the evening.
Okay. Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
 - Good evening.
Are you Mr. Raj?
 - Yes. - Please come, sir.
Please have a seat, sir.
 - Thank you.
Good evening, madam.
 - Good evening, Raj.
You are looking ravishing.
 - Thank you.
Are you going for a party?
You have met me today
 after so many years.
Is this less than any party?
 Sit down. - Thank you.
What will you have? Anything cold?
Or something hot?
Nothing.
How is life, Raj?
Everything is fine.
You can go.
 - Okay. Madam.
Miss Sonia... I am sorry.
Our new mobile handsets, RX
 - 49 models.
There are some faults in that.
The handsets given to the
 staff for observation...
...there are complaints in it
 that whenever a number is...
...dialed, the next number
 in the memory...
...also gets connected. So
 basically it becomes...
...it becomes a three way conference.
A report was sent to
 the R&D department.
They have sent for the
 chip for rectification.
But the production has started.
 We will have to stop it.
So, for that we will
 need your orders.
So stop it. Do what you want.
No, your signatures are
 needed for that so...
...please sign this.
 - What is the hurry, Raj?
I will sign wherever you tell me to.
Your phone is ringing.
Hello. Hi, baby.
 - Sweetheart, do you miss me too?
I was thinking about you.
 - Beloved...
You remember that we have
 to go to the party today?
I will not be able to
 come to the party.
I am very tired.
It was the first day of
 the office, isn't it?
You have given me such
 a huge responsibility.
Understand. I am extremely sorry.
 - Please sit.
No, darling. I am very tired today.
Please forgive me this time.
What are you doing?
I am not doing anything new.
 - All this is wrong.
Okay. You think that all
 this is wrong now.
Without whom you couldn't stay...
No... Sonia...
You were right. I will get success.
But staying away from you,
 I have always felt...
...how lonely I am.
 - No, Sonia. Try to understand.
You went so far away from me. You
 went so far away from me, Raj.
Sonia. Please let me go.
 - I love you, Raj.
I missed you so much.
Please, Sonia. No.
Look at me.
Raj... show me you are
 an animal. Show me.
I love you, Raj. I love you so much.
Nothing means so much...
 As much as you, Raj.
Raj... Raj... what happened, Raj?
Raj... listen to me.
No...
 - Raj, what happened, Raj?
Sonia. What we are doing is wrong.
Nothing is wrong, Raj.
 Come on, love me.
Sorry. - Raj, nothing is wrong.
 - Please let me go.
You cannot me leave me alone, Raj.
I cannot betray my wife. Leave me.
Raj... listen to me Raj. Raj!
Where did I tell you
 to leave your wife?
I just want a physical relationship.
I don't want this physical
 relationship. Leave me!
If I don't have any problems,
 why are you bothered?
Raj... listen to me. Raj.
You cannot leave me like this, Raj.
You are insulting me.
I made you a director
 of the company...
...from a common executive,
 so that you be with me.
Near me! Not because
 you deserved it.
This relation will be a ladder
 of success for you.
I have power, position
 and money today.
I can make you reach places!
 Just think about it.
When you slept with me, you
 didn't want to be my wife.
Now when you are someone
 else's wife...
...you are adamant on sleeping with me?
It is god's grace that
 I didn't marry you.
Otherwise, the way you are generous
 on me for sex...
...you would be generous
 on Ranjit Roy for money.
Raj! Raj! What do you think?
 I am a bitch?
I am a slut? I am a
 bloody prostitute?
You think that I am
 a male prostitute...
...so that you use
 me in lieu of the...
...money and post that
 you gave me? No!
Raj!
Raj!
Raj!
Raj, Whatever you did was not right.
 It was very wrong!
Raj...
Priya...
Where were you for so long?
Nothing. I was stuck up in a
 meeting. Therefore, I am late.
Your mobile was shut down too.
No. The mobile is on.
The battery is down.
There is a party in the house.
 All the guests are waiting.
I am sorry, Priya.
 I know I am very late.
You take care of the guests. I will
 freshen up. Please... - Okay.
I tell you. You have taken
 the glass once again.
That is strange. It is strange.
I thought that after
 marriage you'd...
...prepare a peg for me
 with your own hands.
Forget about preparing a peg, you...
...want to kick the prepared peg too!
You married me to make pegs
 for you? - No... no...
I will try to execute my plan
 in a different manner.
I mean...
The thirst should become water now.
What does that mean?
That means, the thirst should
 become water now.
Every drop... every drop
 should become a rose.
If you give it to me
 with your own hands...
...mineral water will be
 turned into alcohol too.
Wow!
Her hands are of a very
 alcoholic type.
Why shouldn't they be?
 Why shouldn't they be?
I used to scrub the
 tables of fifty...
...drunkards in my life.
 What happened?
Hi, Priya!
 - Hi! - Congrats.
Beautiful house.
 - Thank you.
Neither am I a poet, nor
 am I am a poet's nephew.
I am just the result of my
 parent's entertainment.
Wow!
 - What are you talking about?
Mr. Sharma is flirting a lot today.
It seems that he has fallen
 in love or something.
Love? What is love?
Fool! You don't know what love is?
 I will tell you what love is.
Love is that Italian
 flooring where one...
...feels like sweeping and
 swabbing incessantly. - Wow!
Forget about sweeping
 and swabbing now.
Why do you forget that you aren't
 what you were anymore?
Now you are the legally wedded
 wife to Ram Chotlani.
I forget it!
Hello, everybody.
Raj! Welcome!
Maybe this is the
 first party where...
...the guests are welcoming
 the hosts.
Mr. Chotlani, you are hitting
 me swaddling it in a blanket!
No! It's a beautiful house.
 Congratulations.
Thank you. What were
 you talking about?
They were telling Rakesh
 what love is.
You don't know what love is?
I am a bit confused.
Either it is a case, or it is
 an Italian marble flooring.
Everyone has described love
 according to themselves.
Tell us. What is your
 definition of love?
Mr. Chotlani... according
 to me, love is love.
Which has faith passion and loyalty.
And it is this loyalty,
 that doesn't...
...allow a person to
 be become disloyal.
Wow!
Did you understand now?
Yes, sister-in-law.
 I understood it now.
Now tell me. What happens
 when one falls in love?
That's a good question.
 - Tell us. Tell us please.
Tell them. Tell them.
 It is your turn now.
That scene of romance,
 that romantic heart.
That crazy season, that
 flirting of yours.
It makes me restless.
That love!
Those days of love, that
 moment, that time.
That trickling season,
 that monsoon.
That movement of breath,
 that aromatic veil.
That embrace, that
 cloud of tresses.
That shyness of yours,
 lowering of eyes.
That sudden turn as you go.
You understanding it,
 without me saying it.
That saying everything in signals.
Those fights and nags,
 repenting later.
Getting angry and then
 talking it out.
Returning once again.
What happened? You thought
 that it was someone else?
No... just like that.
Why were you startled?
I was thinking about something else.
If the husband thinks
 of something else...
...in the bedroom, it
 isn't a good sign.
Why only in the bedroom?
If the husband has anyone
 in the mind...
...except the wife, it
 isn't a good thing.
Raj... it was a good party.
 All of them were happy.
Even I liked it. Everyone
 praised you.
Everyone praised the house.
 They praised the food too.
Did anyone praise my beloved?
I only like my husband praising me.
And I like it the most
 when people praise you.
When will you praise me now?
What I do is enough already.
When he will come forget praise,
 if you call me...
...twenty times, I will answer once.
I am coming!
Another thing. That fault report...
 - Yes.
Send it to my desk by evening.
 - Good morning sir.
Hi. Morning.
Sir. The chairman is waiting for
 you since a long time. - Okay.
Keep this inside.
 - Yes. Sir.
Good morning, Sir.
Sir, you called me.
This is your resignation
 letter. Sign this.
You are resigning from this company.
But why, sir?
You are asking me this?
 I should tell you this?
How dare you attempt to
 rape my wife? - What?
I said... sign it.
Sir. This is a lie! An utter lie.
Sonia... what is all this going on?
What did you tell him
 about me? Tell me...
Don't talk to her. You speak
 to my wife in my presence?
Sign this letter and
 get lost from here.
Sir, listen to me.
 - Shut up.
I don't want me and my
 company to be defamed.
Therefore, I am just asking
 you for a resignation.
Sir...
 - The wretched thing that you did...
I would have shot you
 for that! Get out!
Sir... listen to me... - Get out
 from here. - Listen to me...
I want this letter signed
 within twenty four hours.
What Sonia told you is wrong, sir.
 - Get lost!
Stop it, darling. Please.
 Control yourself.
Why are you increasing your blood
 pressure? - How dare he!
Please baby. For me... please.
 Come on. Come on.
Idiot. What is his worth?
Why don't you people believe me?
I didn't do this. Forget
 about doing it.
I can't even think about it.
 Rakesh, this is the truth.
This Sonia is trying to trap
 me. She called me home.
She tired to exploit me sexually.
And when I refused, she accused me!
And... and see. She gave me
 this resignation letter.
She tells me to sign it.
 Why should I resign?
I will not resign. You are
 my friend, isn't it?
You are my friends. You
 are my colleagues.
You don't believe me?
Raj.
I discussed your matter with the
 whole staff once you left.
Nobody believed it.
What do you mean to say?
 If nobody believed it...
...I should accept that what
 I have been accused...
...of is true? I should
 give the resignation?
No. I don't want you to resign.
See. Everyone can commit a mistake.
If I were in your place maybe I'd
 have committed the same mistake.
See, Raj.
Even if I do believe you...
Will you be able to prove
 that you are innocent?
Forget all this. Think only
 about your service right now.
You have taken such a big
 loan and bought a bungalow.
If you resign, from where
 will you repay this loan?
Listen to what I say.
Go to Mr. Rai and beg of him.
Tell him that you committed
 a mistake. After that...
You have gone crazy.
What do you want?
 I should beg of him...
...and that too for the mistake
 that I didn't commit?
Keep your suggestions to yourself.
If you don't give the bank
 another guarantee...
...the bank will seize your bungalow.
Just because you are
 a man, it doesn't...
...mean that you will do anything
 and I will forgive you.
I want a divorce.
 I am leaving you now.
See, Raj.
Sexual exploitation is nothing new.
Men do this with women in
 big companies and offices.
But this is a different case.
A woman has tried to
 sexually exploit you.
As far as our society's
 mindset is concerned...
...these kind of wretched antics
 are reserved for men.
Mr. Chotlani, how
 will I get justice?
If you wish, we can have a
 case of sexual harassment.
But...
It will be difficult to prove.
 The chances to win are less...
And listen to the side
 effects of defeat too.
Newspapers need such spices.
They will print you
 on the front page.
They will defame you
 by making you famous.
Women's organizations will
 make your life hell.
You will lose your service.
You will fall so low
 in people's eyes...
...that nobody will be ready
 to give you work too.
Raj, this is the question of
 a big company and it's MD.
They will accuse you of attempted...
...rape to save their
 prestige and dignity.
And I am sorry but maybe
 they will prove it too.
After that... seven years of
 rigorous imprisonment.
Did you tell this to Priya?
 - No. - Good. Good.
Look, Raj. I am your friend.
I suggest you as a friend. Resign.
And give any excuse to Priya and...
...go somewhere far away with her.
Raj...
You are resigning from the job?
I found this resignation letter
 from your coat pocket.
Yes.
But why?
Sonia has accused me
 of attempted rape.
What?
 - Yes.
The truth is that when I went to...
...her house to discuss the
 problems in mobiles...
...she tried to exploit me sexually.
When I refused, she accused me.
Today, using her power, she wants
 to chuck me out of the company.
So much has occurred, and
 you didn't even tell me.
What should I have told you?
 Nobody believes me.
My staff and my colleagues
 think that I am wrong.
In fact, my close friend, Rakesh.
Even he doesn't believe in me.
I have just met Chotlani.
I asked him what to
 do now. He told me...
...that if the matter ends
 on an resignation, resign.
He told me that nobody
 will believe...
...that a woman can sexually
 assault a man.
Now you tell me when nobody
 is ready to accept it...
...how could I have told you that?
How would I convince you? How
 would I make you believe?
You wouldn't have
 to make me believe.
I would have accepted
 it if you said it.
I know that you cannot do like this.
Raj. You will not resign. If
 you resign and stay silent...
...then people will accept this
 lie to be the truth.
People will think you to
 be wrong all through life.
We will fight against this.
 For our truth and honour.
Priya...
Now whether the decision is
 in my favour or against...
You are with me. I will fight now.
Hello?
Mr. Chotlani?
 - No. I am his assistant speaking.
I am Raj Malhotra here.
 Can I speak to him?
Yes, just a minute. Sir.
 It is Mr. Raj Malhotra.
Hello. - Mr. Chotlani. I have
 decided to fight this case.
What?
See, Raj. I have explained
 everything to you earlier.
But you understand it once again.
I have thought about it thoroughly.
 I will fight this case.
And my wife is with me in this case.
Okay. I will send
 the notice to them.
But remember this.
Keep going to the office like
 everyday and keep working.
So that they don't get another
 pretext to ask you to resign.
Did you understand?
 - Yes. - All the best.
Good morning.
Jenni.
 - Yes, sir?
Send me today's report in my room.
 - Okay, sir.
Good morning. Sir.
You are wishing me a good morning...
...after ruining sleep of the nights?
 I didn't hand...
...you over to the police for your
 dirty and wretched antics.
I was leaving you by
 merely having you resign.
And you want to place
 a case against me?
You have accused me that my wife...
...has tried to sexually exploit you?
But... this is the truth, sir.
 - Shut up.
The truth is that you
 want to black mail me.
You thought that I would be scared...
...if you place a case
 against me like this.
And to save me and my company's
 reputation...
...I won't take a resignation
 from you.
Raj Malhotra. You don't know
 about my power and contacts.
I will crush you.
I will answer your notice in court.
After that I will accuse you of...
...attempting to rape my wife.
I promise.
I will ruin your present
 as well as future.
This is the court where
 such a matter...
...will be discussed which has
 never been discussed before.
The MD of the biggest mobile
 company in the country...
...Voice mobiles, Sonia
 Rai has been...
...accused of sexual harassment...
...by a director of her company,
 Raj Malhotra.
The whole city is shocked.
In a country like India,
 where women...
...are revered as goddesses,
 can this be possible?
Please be seated.
Mr. Chotlani, you may proceed.
Thank you, your honour.
There are two sexes living
 in our society.
Men and women.
It is said in the scriptures,
 that a woman is like a river.
If she remains in the boundaries
 of her banks...
...she brings happiness
 and prosperity.
And if she breaks the boundaries
 of her banks...
...all she brings is destruction.
This is the case today.
A woman has broken her boundaries.
A wife, for her lust has tried
 to keep sexual relations...
...with a stranger working
 in her company.
When that man refused, that woman...
...tried to remove that
 man from his post.
Today, that man is knocking at
 the court's doors for justice.
That man is my client
 Mr. Raj Malhotra.
And that woman is Mr.
 Ranjeet Rai's wife...
...and the managing director
 of Voice mobiles...
Mrs. Sonia Rai.
Not only do I have faith,
 I am sure that my...
...client will get justice and
 only justice from your court.
That's all. Your honour.
Wow.
What a speech.
 What a lecture. Great.
He says that there are two
 sexes in this society.
That is a fact.
So there should be boundaries
 for both the sexes.
What kind of impoverished
 mind does this society...
...possess that a woman should
 stay in her boundaries...
...and a man should wander
 about like a wild hog?
Order. Order.
I never heard till today that
 a woman flirted with a man.
Or she whistled or winked at him.
Forget about anyone else, Milord.
Let us take your case.
 Better still, let us take mine.
Come on.
For a minute we will accept
 that you and me...
...are not handsome like
 Mr. Raj Malhotra.
And we will accept that
 Mrs. Sonia Rai...
...did try to sexually harass
 Mr. Raj Malhotra.
But...
How did this indigestible
 thing take place...
...and why did it take place?
 To prove this, Milord...
...I ask permission to
 call the prey of rape...
...Mr. Raj Malhotra,
 into the witness box.
You are permitted.
 - Thank you, Milord.
Mr. Raj Malhotra.
A woman tried to rape you.
This beautiful incident...
Which no man has experienced
 till date.
When did this happen?
It happened on the 21st of January.
And just a day before that,
 on the 20th of January...
...was the annual day of your
 company, correct? - Yes.
What happened on that day?
On that day. The whole staff
 was to be promoted.
And Mrs. Sonia announced the
 promotion of the whole staff.
Were you expecting it, a promotion?
As a chief executive officer.
So... did you get it? Promotion?
Instead of making me
 a chief executive...
...she put me on the
 board of directors.
Wow! You were standing for sweets
 and got a buffet? Wow!
What did you think was the reason...
...behind this charitable attitude
 of Mrs. Sonia Rai?
Maybe she was impressed
 with my work.
You are lying.
If you forget it, I will
 remind you that...
...in that party held on the
 twentieth of January...
...you told your colleagues
 that the...
...reason of your promotion
 was your personality.
It was the magic of
 your personality.
I had joked. - Did you say that,
 or did you not say that?
Yes. I did say that.
Point to be noted, Milord.
He thought that the reason for his...
...promotion was the magic
 of his personality.
He thought that Mrs. Sonia Rai...
...was impressed by his
 muscular personality.
This is wrong. I didn't
 mean to say that.
The meaning. I will decide
 about the meaning.
I am educated. I am a MA, LLB.
 I will take it out.
You just answer my questions.
What all did you talk about
 in the party that day?
Nothing special. Just casual talks.
Casual talks?
The old man has got such an item.
What must be this old man be doing?
Even Viagra doesn't have
 affect on seventy plus.
All these matters were casual.
But I didn't say all this.
Were these talks done with you?
 - Yes.
When the liquor was flowing
 freely in the party...
...what talks were going
 on about Mrs. Sonia Rai?
I don't remember.
I will remind him, Milord.
Didn't you say that Mrs. Sonia Rai...
...seemed sexy and attractive?
 - No, I didn't say it.
It was my colleague who said it.
 - What did you say?
See...
 - That's it. - But... - That's it.
What happened after that?
The dance program
 started after that.
Oh, you mean dancing and singing?
 - Yes.
Whom did you dance with?
It was a changing partners dance.
Changing... oh! You mean
 the wives started to change.
Did it happen that you were Mrs.
 Sonia's dance partner too?
Yes.
So you must have enjoyed it.
Whose beauty you were
 sighing about...
...you were clutching her
 waist and danced...
Objection, your honour.
The assumption of the defense
 is just fictitious.
Objection sustained.
 - Thank you, sir.
Okay. Sir. Okay.
The next day...
What happened when you reached
 the office with your promotion?
My friend Rakesh came to meet me.
He told me that the handsets
 had some problems.
He told me that the production
 of the handsets has started.
The production should be stopped.
And he told me to meet
 Mrs. Sonia too.
Did you speak to her?
 Did you speak to her?
Her PA told me to meet her at home.
You are very lucky.
What you wanted, happened.
It was necessary for me to meet her.
It was important for you to
 go home too, Mr. Malhotra.
Because it was the house warming
 party at his new house. Am I right?
But this was more important.
 - What?
To stop the production
 of the handsets.
Handset... I thought... anyway. Then?
I reached Mrs. Sonia's house. Some
 of her maid opened the door.
Then Mrs. Sonia came...
 - Mrs. Sonia came.
What did you do after that?
What did I go to do there?
 - What did you go to do there?
I have told you what
 I went to do there.
No. You haven't told me.
 I will tell you.
Milord, when Mrs. Sonia
 came he told her...
My god! You are looking ravishing.
I didn't say it the way
 you are saying it.
You leave the way of witness,
 take heed to the poem.
Did you say that, or did you
 not say that? - I did.
That's it. That's it. What
 happened after that?
As soon as I started speaking
 about the mobile...
...Mrs. Sonia came
 and sat at my side.
At your side? - Yes.
 - Her husband called up after that.
I didn't find it correct
 and went away. - Correct.
When all of a sudden
 she clutched me and...
That means... suddenly... suddenly...
Your modesty was outraged.
 - Yes.
Then you must have sent
 Mrs. Sonia to a side.
No. I was completely shocked.
 I didn't know what to do.
And Mrs. Sonia started
 to kiss me like mad.
Just a minute. You were shocked
 and stood stunned...
...and Mrs. Sonia started
 kissing you.
You mean to say that?
Didn't I tell you that I couldn't
 understand anything?
I was totally confused?
You are the Taj Mahal. The
 Taj Mahal. Yes, Milord.
The people go to see the Taj Mahal...
...and kiss it's architecture
 to their heart's content.
And it can't even move.
 It can't even say...
O' soul of Shahajahan. Save
 me from this kisses.
Order.
What happened after that?
She pushed me down after that.
 - What?
She pushed me down after that.
Mrs. Sonia pushed you down?
 - Yes. - Mrs. Sonia? - Yes.
And she started kissing
 me after that.
What were you doing at that time?
Didn't I say that I was confused?
What?
 - As to what I should do.
Where was she kissing you?
 - On the face and shoulders.
That's it? Only on the
 face and shoulders?
On the face and the shoulders?
You were on the floor. Sonia
 could kiss your whole body.
I was not down. Sonia was on
 the floor. I was on Sonia.
Just a minute. Just a minute.
 Milord, just a minute.
You were up?
 - Yes.
And Mrs. Sonia was down?
 - Yes.
Milord... this means
 that the one who...
...was being raped was
 up and the one...
...who was raping was down?
This...
This rape has a new style
 just like this case. Up and down.
Anyway. What were
 you doing lying up?
Tell me. You must be
 doing something too.
Were you lying on her
 like dead weight?
Whatever was happening
 was so intense...
...my senses had stopped working.
And I lost my control...
 - That's it. That's it, Milord.
Point to me noted. This
 man lost control. Then?
Mrs. Sonia unbuttoned my shirt.
The locket on my neck came out.
It had my wife's photo in it.
I understood that whatever
 was happening was wrong.
And I stood up and started to go.
That means, if you didn't
 see the locket...
...would your conscience not arise?
I object your honour...
 - Okay... okay.
So milord. In the end
 his conscience arose.
Good. What happened after that?
I didn't agree to anything
 that she said.
She started shrieking and
 I went away from there.
You mean... you saved
 your dignity? Good.
What did you do after that?
You must have called Mr.
 Rai after this.
And told him to take care of
 his wife. Did you do that?
No. I didn't do anything like that.
Why?
Sir, Sonia acted wrongly with me.
But I didn't want to show her
 mistake to the world and insult her.
Why did you set this case then?
Because Mr. Rai accused me of
 rape and asked me to resign.
Otherwise, I wouldn't
 have filed this case.
You are lying.
You didn't tell this to anyone
 because you are guilty.
No... - Milord. I will
 prove this in court.
I wish to bring Mr. Malhotra's
 secretary Jenny in the court.
You are permitted.
Good morning, Jenny.
Milord. A wife at home and
 secretary in the office.
They are very close companions.
 You know that.
Tell me. When he used to meet you...
...in the morning, did he wish you?
Yes.
 - How?
Whatever he had in his hands.
Newspapers or files. He hit
 me from behind and wished me.
He would hit you on the back.
 Good morning, Jenny.
No.
 - Where then? - Back.
Back? Back... there is a
 lot of place back. Where?
Here. On the bum.
 - On the bum? Bomb?
I object your honour.
Mr. Patel forgets how
 to speak to a lady.
How am I speaking about?
The organ of the body which
 she refers to in English...
...can she not tell it in
 the national language?
Objection overruled.
 - Thank you milord.
Milord... as far as my knowledge
 of English language is concerned...
...the organ which she calls
 a bum in English...
...is also known as the butt.
The butt... the ass.
We walk along with your butt.
Mr. Malhotra used to
 hit her on her but...
...with paper, file or anything
 that he had in hand.
And then he used to wish
 her good morning.
This means a thwack first
 and good morning.
A thwack and good morning.
Anyway. Tell me.
Where all did he hit the men in the
 office to greet them good morning?
He used to shake hands
 and wish them.
Such partiality? Such double
 standards, Mr. Malhotra.
This is injustice.
He shakes hands with men and
 hits women on the butt?
This is not done.
You may go now.
Milord. This is Mr. Raj
 Malhotra's character.
That's all Milord. Thank you.
Mr. Chotlani, would you
 wish to say something?
Yes, your honour.
Your honour. I'd wish
 permission to call...
...Mrs. Sonia Rai in the witness box.
Permission granted.
Mrs. Sonia Rai. As my client
 Mr. Raj Malhotra said...
...he was expecting a promotion to...
...the post of a CEO
 on the annual day.
But you made him a director, why?
I was impressed with his work.
You came to the company for the
 first time on 20th January.
And you had to decide the promotion
 list right then and there.
When and where did you see Mr.
 Raj Malhotra's service record?
I had asked about him
 to my husband. - When?
That same day, when the
 function was to start.
How much time did this
 discussion take?
Two hours? One hour? Half an hour?
 - Ten seconds.
Did I hear ten seconds?
 - Yes.
In ten seconds your
 husband gave you...
...information about Raj Malhotra's
 service record.
And you were impressed immediately...
...and removed the other name
 and wrote Raj Malhotra on the list.
Point to be noted, your honour.
Mr. Patel, did you hear it too?
Mrs. Rai, what happened after that?
The next day, Mr. Raj came
 to my house and then...
...he spoke to me about the
 faults in mobile phones.
I said, all right. Stop
 the production.
My husband called up at that time.
I was speaking to him when...
 when all of a sudden...
...he grabbed me.
 - You must have screamed then...
Yes. - Your husband must have
 heard your screams too.
The phone call was over till then.
But you said just now that you
 were talking over the phone.
Yes. But till that time
 I had finished the call.
You screamed?
Yes. But there wasn't
 anyone at home.
What about the servant
 who had served water.
She had some urgent work.
 She went on a holiday.
And the rest of the servants?
I have heard that there is a army...
...of around six servants
 in your house?
All of them were on holiday.
Why were they on holiday, Mrs. Rai?
21st January is neither 26th
 January nor 25th August.
It is neither Holi, Diwali, Eid,
 Baishaki nor Christmas.
Then, what was the holiday,
 please tell me.
There can be some personal work too.
Oh yes... yes...
That means everyone's mothers
 fall ill together too.
Didn't you think who'd give water?
Who will do the work
 around the house?
And who will serve drinks?
All right, Mrs. Sonia Rai.
What did Mrs. Raj do after he
 pushed you on the ground?
He started kissing me after that.
Were you on top of Mr. Raj
 or was it vice versa?
Objection, milord.
Mr. Raj has accepted that he
 was on top of Mrs. Sonia.
Why are we starting the top
 and bottom circus once again?
See...
Whether the pumpkin
 falls on the dagger...
...or the dagger falls
 on the pumpkin...
...it is the pumpkin which gets cut.
You should know that.
Mr. Patel, I know
 that I am a lawyer.
I am not some pumpkin
 cutter or seller.
But I keep this information
 at least...
...that neither does the pumpkin...
...fall on the dagger
 all by itself and...
...nor does the dagger cut
 the pumpkin all by itself.
Order order. This is a court,
 not a fruit marker.
Forget about the pumpkin
 and come to the point.
Thank you. - Your honour,
 the point is whether Mr...
...Raj wanted to attempt
 rape or did...
...Mrs. Sonia Rai wish to
 sexually assault him.
Thank you very much, Mrs.
 Rai. You may go now.
Your honour. Mrs. Sonia Rai being...
...impressed by Mr. Raj
 Malhotra's personality...
...and promoting him, sending
 all servants on a holiday.
And calling him alone at home.
All this clearly indicates
 that the pumpkin...
...was telling the dagger itself
 to come and cut me.
Come and slice me. That's all.
Lies. This is lies, Milord.
Mr. Chotlani is turning a
 coincidence into an incident.
He will have to give
 proper proof for it.
I will give you that proper proof.
It will prove that Mr. Raj
 attempted rape on Mrs. Sonia.
Mrs. Malhotra...
Unbutton... please...
I object, your honour. Mr. Patel
 is trying to insult my client.
I am trying? I am insulting him.
When he ruined someone's dignity
 even his dignity will be ruined!
But his dignity has
 already been looted.
We are fighting this case in the
 court, isn't it, Mr. Chotlani?
Objection overruled.
 - Thank you, milord.
Mr. Raj, unbutton your shirt.
Unbutton. They are
 our people. Please.
Please turn... back...
That's it.
Wear it now.
Milord. Mrs. Sonia's nail
 marks on his body.
The witness' testimony
 about his character.
And the biggest thing, milord.
His accepting in the court
 that he had wandered...
All this proves that Mr. Raj
 attempted rape on Mrs. Sonia.
I will request the court to stop
 this case and give Mr. Raj...
...the strictest punishment
 for the rape attempt.
That's all, milord.
The case proceedings are over.
The court will declare it's
 decision next week.
Now the court is adjourned.
You wandered. Your body
 had Sonia's nail marks.
You hid such an important
 matter from me?
We have lost the case, Raj.
 Nothing can be done now.
Mr. Raj... what do you have to say...
...about it being proved
 that you falsely...
...implicated Mrs. Sonia?
 - No comments.
Would you wish to say
 anything about the...
...accusation of rape attempt
 on Mrs. Sonia that is on you?
Mrs. Malhotra, about your husband's
 antics... - Please.
Nobody is ready to say anything.
But the court will give
 it's decision next week.
But it seems that Mr. Raj
 and his wife had done...
. this case to blackmail Mrs.
 Sonia and her company.
Umesh Kumar, Star News.
Priya... Priya. Listen to me.
Priya, I agree that
 whatever I said...
...in court must have hurt you.
 - I have been hurt.
What you should have told me,
 I found that in court.
You hid everything from me.
You just said that Sonia just
 sexually harassed you.
Priya. That is what
 I want to explain...
What explanation will you give?
Just that you were a
 man and were seduced?
No...
That was a moment which
 came and went away.
I said in court what
 happened with me.
If need be, I could have
 hidden everything.
I would have resigned silently and...
...wouldn't make this
 case on Sonia too.
I agree that I committed a mistake.
But whatever happened
 wasn't intentional.
My past was behind that.
Five years ago, I used to work...
...for the MTN mobile company
 in South Africa.
I met Sonia there and
 our affair started.
Our thoughts and ideologies
 didn't meet.
She placed her career above
 me and aborted my child.
We were separated. I
 felt choking there.
I left everything and came here.
I didn't tell you all this,
 because I forgot everything.
But I didn't know that my past
 would come to me like this one day.
Sir...
The bank manager has come.
Call him.
 - Yes.
Hello, Raj. Sorry to disturb you...
...but it is very important.
 I was in Bangkok.
I returned just today and
 knew about your case.
There is a message on
 my answering machine.
Which has yours and Sonia's voice.
That message is of 21st January.
Whatever took place between
 you and Sonia...
...all that has been recorded
 on my answering machine.
Here is the cassette. Listen to it.
Maybe your case will be helped
 with this. - Thank you.
That's it! This is a very big proof.
We will win the case now.
There is some formality
 with the forensic labs.
I will do that. You don't worry.
 Go home and relax.
Thank you, very much. - Bye!
Raj. I have taken the certificate
 from the forensic lab.
This voice is genuine and there
 is no tampering of cassette.
You can understand me, isn't it?
You don't need to take
 any tension now.
Yes. Yes. No I... No... no... that...
I will produce it as an
 evidence in the court.
Mr. Chotlani... Mr. Chotlani...
 what happened to you?
Please take him to the hospital!
Raj...
The cassette is finished. It
 could prove you are innocent.
I am sorry.
Sir... it is Mrs. Sonia Rai's call.
You go.
 - Okay.
Hello?
I am very sorry about
 your lawyer's accident.
But if you meet me in privacy,
 we can work out something.
Come in.
Come in, Raj.
Looking at you so helpless
 in the court...
...I was pained seeing you
 like that, Raj. Really.
My heart wept for you. I never
 thought bad for you.
And you know that. I have
 one principle in life.
One has to lose something
 to get something.
Isn't it, Raj?
 - Yes, you are right, Sonia.
There are free lunches in life.
 You have to pay for everything.
But I want my life back.
 And for that...
...I am ready to give you any price.
Good. Think that your life is
 back to you. Come with me.
With the liquid of your love...
There is a fog of
 love on the heart.
I want to make love to you.
I don't like the problems
 of the beloved.
Rock me, baby. Take me, baby.
'Kiss me baby, push me, baby.
I don't know what thirst this is.
Why every emotion pierces me.
Why is there is a dream
 of love in the eyes?
Why is every heartbeat yearning?
On the strength of
 your ambitions...
...I will live, my beloved.
It is difficult to
 live in sanity now.
'Come on, I will make you mine.
How have I loved you, there
 is a fire in the heart.
With the aroma of
 your heartbeats...
...there is a fog of love.
Yes?
Mrs. Priya Malhotra
 has come to meet you.
Send her in.
I had called Raj. - You can
 tell me to what you want to.
There isn't any difference
 between me and my husband.
There is a difference,
Anyway. The court will give
 it's decision next week.
And he will lose the
 sexual assault...
...case that he has
 charged against me.
He will lose.
Then I will accuse him
 of a rape attempt.
He will lose there too. After that...
...he will be sentenced
 for seven years.
I can save Raj from the sentence.
I can give back his post to
 him too. On one condition.
Go and tell Raj, the job
 that he left incomplete...
...tell him to complete
 that job.
And stay as my keep
 all through life.
Keep.
I came because I thought that the...
...woman inside you awakened.
 You understood your mistake.
But I didn't know that
 you think so low.
Mrs. Sonia... for this power and post
 which god knows how many men you...
...used as a ladder
 to achieve, being...
...blind in it's pride, you want
 to snatch my husband from me?
Listen. Nor will my husband
 accept your conditions.
And neither will I let
 him go to prison.
Who will save him from going to
 prison, Mrs. Priya Malhotra?
You?
When the husband is bewitched...
...it is the wife who
 removes the spirit.
I didn't think till now that
 I will fight the case.
But now... I will fight
 my husband's case.
I will challenge the
 court's decision.
And I will unveil so
 many veils of shame...
...in the open court, you wouldn't...
...have opened so many behind
 closed doors too.
This will be the first time.
A woman will unveil a woman
 in a court full of men.
Get lost.
Raj...
Why did you call the bank
 manager from Sonia's house?
There was a party in our house.
Maybe to invite him...
Just a minute. I knew
 that he was in Bangkok.
I had called Rakesh Sharma.
 It seems...
...because of the phone's defect...
...one line went to the bank manager?
Baba... I am going to fight
 my first case today.
I don't have anything
 except the truth.
Bless me. For the truth.
Please be seated.
Sir, this is Mrs. Priya
 Malhotra's case.
Mrs. Priya Malhotra,
 you may proceed.
Thank you, your honour.
Your honour, like everyone knows...
...Mr. Raj Malhotra's lawyer
 is injured in an accident.
Therefore, I wish to
 continue this case.
Milord, what is left in this case?
The bowling and batting is done.
You will be telling the
 final score today.
Where has this new umpire come from?
Your honour. The evidence and
 facts that I want to show...
...they haven't come in
 the court before this.
But your honour...
 - Mr. Patel.
It is outside the boundaries
 of the court...
...to decide without listening
 fully to the prosecution.
Let her proceed.
Please continue.
 - Thank you, your honour.
First of all, I ask
 permission to call...
...Sonia's husband. Mr. Ranjeet
 Rai in the court.
You are permitted.
Mr. Rai. I have heard that such...
...a big empire, status, position...
...whatever you have got,
 it wasn't willed to you.
You got it with your own hard work.
The world knows it.
I came in this city when
 I was fifteen years old.
And forty five years later,
 I own fifteen hundred crores.
You married very late too. At fifty?
When I felt that I have achieved...
...and I can leave something
 for my kids I married.
But you were divorced within a year.
And your wife gave the reason...
...of divorce that she wasn't
 sexually satisfied with you.
She didn't get any other excuse.
Or else, how would I marry
 again within two months?
And you next wife left you too?
 - I left my second wife. - Why?
She had a bad character. She...
...kept relations with another man.
And then you married Mrs.
 Sonia the third time - Yes.
It is two years that
 you are married.
You don't have any kids till now.
Objection, milord.
What does the lawyer wish to prove?
My client Mrs. Sonia Rai is
 a victim of attempted rape.
Why did she not become a mother...
...why did Mr. Rai not
 become a father...
...how is all that connected
 to this case?
It is connected, your honour.
This proves to the court
 that by marrying...
, . Mr. Rai Mrs. Sonia Rai
 got money and position.
But she didn't get that
 physical love...
...which every wife wishes
 of her husband.
Thank you, Mr. Rai. You can go now.
Now. I wish permission to call
 Mrs. Sonia to the witness box.
You are permitted.
Mrs. Sonia
Please tell us. Where and
 how did you meet Mr. Raj?
I object, Milord. Will
 these questions...
...be asked a hundred times?
 My client...
...has already said once that...
 - Your honour...
...I know that Mrs. Sonia has
 answered this question.
But she will give the
 right answers now.
Objection overruled.
 - Thank you, your honour.
Yes, Mrs. Sonia. Where and
 when did you meet Raj?
As I have told earlier.
I met Raj for the first time at
 the company annual function.
Have you become forgetful or are...
...you hiding something
 intentionally?
I will tell you.
You met Mr. Raj Malhotra
 five years ago...
...in Cape Town in South Africa.
Did you remember that?
 - It is possible.
I meet so many people. It
 can be a casual meet.
That meeting wasn't casual
 that you met and separated.
After that meeting, you
 two had an affair.
And the witness of this is the
 staff of MTN mobile in Cape Town.
They can be called to this
 court to testify too.
That was just a passing affair.
 I wasn't serious.
Come on.
You did all those things
 in a passing affair...
...which a woman thinks a hundred
 times before doing.
What have I done, Mrs. Priya?
You were pregnant. And you
 underwent an abortion too.
All this is lies. Raj
 is doing all this...
...just to defame me.
 This is ridiculous.
I have the report of
 the nursing home...
...where you underwent the abortion.
Your honour. This is the report
 of that nursing home.
Mrs. Sonia.
If you had a passing
 affair with Mr. Raj...
...whose child was it? Tell me.
 However modern a woman may be...
...she will always know who the
 father of her child is.
Or have you had so many affairs...
...that you don't remember who
 the father of the child is.
Shut up, you bitch.
Mrs. Sonia. A bitch
 is that who doesn't...
...know who the father
 of her child is.
Just like how...
 - I know it. It was Raj's child.
That's it.
Point to be noted, your honour.
The Mr. Raj that Mrs. Sonia has...
...accused of attempted
 rape, Mrs. Sonia...
...has slept with him,
 been pregnant...
...by him and has aborted
 his child too.
Mrs. Sonia. When you were pregnant...
...you must have told
 Raj to marry you...
When he refused, you must
 have aborted the child...
I never told Raj to marry me.
 - Why?
I wanted to become something.
 I had some ambitions.
Point to be noted, your honour.
Her ambitions were money,
 power and luxury.
And for that, not only did
 she reject Raj's love...
...she also had Raj's child aborted.
And for her ambition and power...
...she reached Mr. Rai. She got
 money and power with him.
But just like the previous
 two wives...
...she didn't get any
 sexual satisfaction.
But when she saw Mr.
 Raj all of a sudden...
...in the party on
 20th January, she...
...saw a way to fulfill the
 emptiness in her life.
She thought that it was better to...
...revive her old relation
 than to make...
...a relation with a
 new man. For that...
...she gave Raj the post of the
 Director instead of CEO.
She thought that Raj would come...
...under pressure of
 her charity and...
...would do whatever she wished.
Calling Mr. Raj home
 by lying to him.
Giving a holiday to all the
 servants of the house.
Wearing a sexy dress and coming out.
All this was a plan to
 set sexual relations.
Objection, Milord.
If Mrs. Sonia wanted to
 have sexual relations...
...did a cat make the nail
 marks on Mr. Raj's back?
Mr. Patel.
When a woman moves her
 hands and feet...
...to save herself,
 with clothes, she...
...scratches a man's nose,
 eyes, ears and face.
There are nail marks on the
 back and chest when a...
...woman pulls a man towards
 herself for sexual pleasure.
What does the lawyer wish to prove?
Just like how you told the court
 of Mr. Raj's character.
I am telling the court about
 Mrs. Sonia's character.
All this is useless talk, milord.
If she really believes that
 her client is innocent...
...she should give
 proof to the court.
I will give proof, Milord.
 And I will give...
...such a proof that the court will...
...give it's decision as
 soon as I show the proof.
I ask permission to call Mr.
 Rakesh Sharma in court.
Permitted.
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Sharma...
The mobiles which Mr.
 Raj Malhotra has made...
...what defect did it have
 because of which...
...Mr. Raj went to Sonia's
 house to stop production?
This is a very strange
 kind of defect.
If you dial any number
 from your handset...
...some other number from your
 handset gets connected.
With that phone, the number
 connected to two places.
Do you have that handset now?
No. As soon as this defect
 was found out I gave...
...my handset to the research
 and development team.
And if anyone would have
 called you that day...
It would have gone on my
 voice mail automatically.
What will anyone have to do
 to listen to that message?
It's very simple.
Dial my number and press star.
A computerized voice will
 ask you for my code.
As soon as you press the code, you...
...will listen to my voice
 mails from the...
...messaging centre of my company.
Is this your mobile number?
 - Yes. Exactly.
Your code?
 - 973.
This is Voice mobile
 messaging centre.
You have message in your inbox.
To playback message, press hash.
What are you doing?
I am not doing anything new.
 - All this is wrong.
Okay. You think that all
 this is wrong now.
Without whom you couldn't stay...
No... Sonia...
You were right. I will get success.
But staying away from you,
 I have always felt...
...how lonely I am.
 - No, Sonia. Try to understand.
You went so far away from me. You
 went so far away from me, Raj.
Sonia. Please let me go.
 - I love you, Raj.
I missed you so much.
 - Please, Sonia. No. - Look at me.
Raj... show me you are
 an animal. Show me.
I love you, Raj. I love you so much.
Raj... Raj... what happened,
 Raj? Raj... listen to me.
No...
 - Raj, what happened, Raj?
Sonia. What we were doing is wrong.
Nothing is wrong, Raj.
 Come on, love me.
Sorry. - Raj, nothing is wrong.
 - Please let me go.
You cannot me leave me alone, Raj.
I cannot betray my wife. Leave me.
Where did I tell you
 to leave your wife?
I just want a physical relation.
I don't want this physical
 relation. Leave me!
If I don't have any problems,
 what can be your problems?
Leave me alone.
 - Raj, you are insulting me.
I made you a director
 of the company...
...from a common executive,
 so that you be with me.
Near me! Not because
 you deserved it.
Your honour. When Mrs. Sonia
 grabbed Mr. Raj from behind...
...at that time, Mr. Raj was
 dialing Mr. Rakesh's number.
And the phone fell from is hands.
Whatever happened there
 was recorded...
...at the voice mail centre.
 And with that...
...due to the defect in the handset...
...it was recorded in the
 answering machine...
...of the bank manager Mr. Karla too.
That cassette has been destroyed...
...in Mr. Chotlani's accident.
 Your honour...
...the voice that you
 heard right now...
...is the message from
 that same messaging...
...centre of the company of
 which Mrs. Sonia is a MD.
In this whole recording...
No, it is wrong... such words were...
...said only by Mr. Raj Malhotra.
The man is not wrong always.
 The woman can be wrong too.
But it is our mindset.
If a man slaps a woman, we
 say that he is a torturer.
And when a woman slaps
 a man we say that...
...the man must have committed
 some mistake.
We think that the man is wrong
 under all circumstances.
I don't say that all
 women are like that.
But there are women like Mrs.
 Sonia in this world too.
Who can do anything
 for their profit.
Your honour. I am a woman too.
But if a woman acts like
 this with any man...
...I have problems. That's
 all. Your honour.
This has been proved in court that...
...the accusations that
 Mr. Raj Malhotra...
...leveled against Mrs. Sonia Rai
 they are true and therefore the...
...court orders Mr. Rai
 to return Mr. Raj...
...his post and his dignity
 in his office.
And if Mr. Raj wishes to
 sue for defamation...
...he can claim compensation.
 The court is adjourned now.
Mrs. Priya. Congratulations.
 - Thank you.
And you, Mr. Malhotra.
The questions in the court,
 don't feel bad about them.
It was strictly professional,
 nothing personal.
After winning 32 cases of
 rape and sexual assault...
...do you know why I
 lost this 33rd case?
Because no lawyer was defending you.
It was your wife. And
 when a faithful wife...
...defends her husband, she can...
...bring back life to him from the
 lord Yama too. - You are right.
This is just court. All the best.
 - Thank you.
What are you talking about?
This is our love. This is our child.
You are talking as if
 you are my husband.
You want to reach the highest
 peak of this world, isn't it?
But remember something...
When you will see down from
 there...
...you will not see
 anyone of your own.
Just remember that.
I am standing below the corporate...
...building of Voice Mobile.
 There is a crowd...
...and much sorrow here.
 The Raj and Sonia...
...harassment law suit which has...
...been in the head lines
 since many days...
...is once again in the headlines
 with a sad incident.
After her defeat in the court
 and her husband leaving her...
...Mrs. Sonia Rai has been
 so sad and dejected...
...that maybe she didn't have
 any strength to face people.
Therefore... she has jumped from
 this building and committed suicide.
Umesh Kumawat. Star News.
The one face which I saw
 when I closed my eyes...
That was you... O beloved...
The one whom I loved and
 my heart found peace...
