Hey girl!
Hey!
Ellis Sister Reunion!
What's your deal?
I have been having a lot of fun!
I don't need lotion in there.
Yeah...you do need lotion in there...
We are looking for a yard artisan
to do some work on our bushes.
I bet workin' on other people's bushes
really makes you want to whack your weeds.
That was dirtier than I thought.
I'm sorry, that got dirty really fast.
No! Mom and Dad sold our childhood home!
This should've been passed on!
All we need you to do is clean out your bedroom.
Oh boy...
It's a damn shame that you never had your night here.
We cannot have a party.
You've been divorced two years.
You can't avoid putting yourself out there forever!
Do not work me like this!
We have so much to do...
You have to invite that cute guy from down the street.
- Hi!
- Hey!
- I'm Maura... - I'm James.
I just wanted to say hi. So that's done.
It's a lot of...under teet?
But...I think I'm gettin' away with it.
It's on backwards.
I don't get this dress.
One of my apples keeps rollin' out of the bag.
I like the story it tells with the fringe...
Oh, here we go.
I've been thinking.
Why?
Will you not drink tonight
so I can let my freak flag fly?
I would LOVE TO.
I heard you were havin' a party
from someone who got invited.
That's pretty sad.
That's a snazzy belt.
Well, thank you!
Yeah, congrats on your wrestling championship.
We need to say goodbye to this house.
But we sure had fun here.
You're type of badass that I'm susceptible to.
My safe word is "keep going".
Everyone start cleaning up the area where they're standing!
- Did you fall on something sharp?!
- Yeah!
It's my ballerina music box...
It really is a beautiful melody.
And...we're do - nope.
