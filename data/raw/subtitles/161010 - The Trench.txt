Get out the way there, you lot!
B Company, over here!
Two red jacks and a ginger lady.
Double claim. Don't be shy.
I see your claim.
J and Q on your four.
Hey, you bastard.
That's me out again.
Hey, Billy. All that
lovely water for us, huh?
Lovely cool spring water, eh?
Best money can buy.
Hi, Billy.
What news from the real world?
- Have you seen my brother?
- Petticoat Lane.
Bone. Got any sugar, mate?
So where did you go, Dell?
Here you are.
Sergeant Major's compliments.
Well done, our Billy.
Move it.
So...
when's fun and games?
Ain't got a clue.
Packed like sardines in reserve.
Still waiting, they say.
Amazing stuff, he had. I mean,
I've never seen the like.
You know, men and women.
What?
Actually fucking...
Actually fucking going at it,
yeah.
Lying bastard.
You lying bastard!
No, I'm telling ya.
I mean,
they was really doing it.
You know, you could see...
everything.
- He were flogging this stuff?
- Ten bob a photo.
You mean that a man and woman
actually...
actually allowed themself to be
photographed
- while they were...
- Nobody would do that!
- You lying bastard.
- You'd do it, wouldn't ya?
If someone paid you Â£100,
do it with a prossie?
Mm, see? See?
Anyway,
he had a mass of this stuff.
- You know, it's incredible.
- I couldn't be recognised.
I'd have to have my face
covered.
She'd pay you
to have your face covered.
I'll have you, bastard!
Sorry, Sarge.
- You be careful, Dennis.
- Yes, Sarge.
- Sarge.
- You alright, boys?
Sarge.
Yes, Sarge.
So, um...
did you buy any, then?
No, they was too expensive,
but, er...
I did get some others.
Let's see 'em then.
Aye, let's see 'em,
you lying bugger.
It's gonna cost ya.
Penny each.
And I want your fuckin' money
as well.
I'll pay for you, Billy.
I want my money back, Dell,
if they're no good.
Well, let's have a look.
Now...
be careful with these.
Pass it over!
- Jesus...
- Alright?
Oh, she's a nice one.
Oh, look at her!
Pass it over, Macfarlane.
Oh, Jesus...
Let's have a look, George.
- Ed!
- How much did that cost?
Eddie!
Look at this.
She's amazing!
She's a dead ringer,
don't you think?
Very pretty. For a tart.
No, who's she like?
Think.
If I knew someone like that,
my son, I...
That girl!
That young one who came for work
in post office last year
what's-her-name?
Swear it were her.
- Don't be daft.
- No.
Obviously isn't, but...
looks like her.
Hand it over.
- What were her name?
- I don't know.
Time's up, sunshine.
- Watch out, officer coming!
- Look lively, boys.
- Yes, no, very good...
- Sir.
At ease.
Don't disturb yourselves.
Carry on.
Sergeant, can I have a word?
It's been postponed.
For a day or two, I think and...
we're to stay here.
- Here?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Well, what about
the rest of the battalion?
In reserve.
And we're to hold the line
until they come back up,
that's...
that's just before the attack.
- Another two nights?
- But... yes, perhaps, yes.
But we won't be going over
with the first wave.
We're third wave.
Yeah, but more nights?
These lads won't last another...
Which was my point exactly,
which I made...
forcefully.
But, uh...
they say we'll get
well rationed.
Hot food, you know, so...
what do you think?
Third wave, you said?
Yes.
We'll be carrying supplies.
Good.
Good.
- Clear that mess up.
- What mess is that, Sarge?
That fucking mess!
Bloody hell.
Thought I'd be through
with digging
when I left the fucking mine.
Where are you gonna piss
and shit then?
Bloody animal!
Digging shit houses.
- What a way to fight a war, eh?
- Make way!
Make way, there!
Mind your backs.
Get out the way.
Aye up!
Royal engineers.
Give us a hand.
You're the professionals.
- Very bloody funny.
- Fine body of men, huh?
Salt of the earth.
Bloody brass...
Didn't look too happy though,
did they?
Macfarlane, Daventry, you're up.
Come on, chop, chop.
Right, piss off, you two.
Get some kip.
Ah, thank you, Sarge.
One up, one down.
Turn about.
Oh...
- There you are, sir.
- Lovely, thank you very much.
Not too bad, sir.
Seen worse.
It's nice and dry anyway.
Um...
I'll have a sandwich please,
Bone, and anything you like
anything you want,
except for, uh...
except the bully beef.
Coming right up, sir.
Hey, I've got
some pilchards here.
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.
Oi, Macfarlane.
Keep your head down.
Right, you two, listen.
No smoking...
no sleeping.
Sarge?
Um...
How far off are they, like?
Cos I can't see anything
from up there.
About 400 yard.
But they'll be watching you,
my friend.
Last lot here
had nine picked off.
Picked off?
Snipers.
Why do you think they dug
these trenches so fucking deep?
They'll have a sniper rifle
fixed on that loophole.
Every time they see it move,
they'll just loose off a shot.
Listening's more important.
So don't play silly buggers.
Alright, Sarge.
You got jocks
to the left of you...
micks to the right.
That's all you need
to know for now.
Sarge?
When's, um...
when's attack, like?
I'll let you know
in plenty of time.
Billy...
put one up.
Dim your lights down.
Daventry.
Daventry.
Yes?
How are you doing?
Couldn't be better.
I can't think of anywhere else
I'd rather be.
How are you doing?
Do you want me to take over?
I need a piss.
So?
What's your problem?
I don't know where to do it.
Do it in the trench.
No one'll notice.
I promise I won't tell.
Ah, you're alright.
I think I'll hold on.
Very noble of you.
How long is it since your Tommy
was killed?
December 1914.
Oh, right. I remember now.
God, nearly two years already.
Ten days before Christmas.
How, uh...
how did he actually cop it?
As a matter of interest.
It was a shell.
Exploded right on top of him.
His mate came to see us,
you know?
See our mum.
I was talking to him afterwards
and he said Tom had...
completely disappeared.
Gone.
Completely.
Well...
almost completely.
All they could find of him...
all the bits and pieces...
fitted in a sock.
Bloody hell.
That's why I'm gonna kill
as many Germans
as I possibly can.
When we go over.
As many as I possibly can.
For Tom.
Did they bury that sock?
What sock?
The sock they collected
the bits and pieces
of your Tommy in.
Oh, I don't know.
I suppose so.
- In a full-size grave?
- I don't know!
Why?
Bit of a waste of effort.
Daventry...
Daventry!
- What is it?
- I thought I heard
something moving out there.
Shh.
It's probably one
of our rodent friends.
I... I thought I heard
German voices.
Billy...
you hear those explosions?
- Don't be daft.
- That's a bombardment
that's been going on
for five days now.
Thousands and thousands
of shells
dropping on the German trenches.
So?
So...
if you were a German...
with all those shells
dropping on you
would you get out your trench
go wandering around
no-man's land?
No.
Don't suppose I would,
would I?
Right, get some sleep,
Macfarlane.
Stand to at six.
Right, Sarge.
Um, nothing to report, Sarge.
It were all quiet like.
Good.
I'll see you later, Daventry.
Aye, see you later.
Alright, mate?
Shit!
- Oh, shit.
- Oh...
you're there, sir.
Excellent, very good.
Alright? Everything alright?
All quiet.
Good, good.
Most of them asleep.
Right...
Can't persuade you to have
a snort, Sergeant?
Keep out the night chill.
I'm teetotal.
I've taken the pledge.
That's fine, very good.
Very admiral.
Brave man, Sergeant.
Don't know how you do it.
I don't condemn.
I don't judge others
that take a drink.
It's just...
it's not for me.
And I like the odd tipple.
Wee small hours...
keeps me sane.
Well, one man's meat...
Sorry?
One man's meat...
is another man's poison.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Well, um... I'm gonna kip down,
are you, uh...
I'll take one last walk through
and get back to reserve.
Long day tomorrow, so...
make sure we keep the men busy.
Don't let them idle.
I'll make sure, sir.
Well, good night.
Ed.
Eddie, what time is it?
Too fucking early to be woke up
for God's sake, Billy.
Sorry.
You know that girl?
The one who came for work
in t'post office.
Did you ever talk to her?
Once or twice. Come on, Billy,
I'm knackered.
How old was she?
I don't know, 19, 20?
She older than us then?
Well,
brain's still working well, kid.
No, I mean, she weren't married
or anything, was she?
Good night.
- Where was she from?
- Sweet Jesus.
Liverpool, I think.
She were an Irish girl from
Liverpool, that's all I heard.
Now put a fucking sock in it!
An Irish girl from Liverpool?
About 19 year old.
Billy...
you don't...
I mean, you're glad
you joined up, aren't you?
Course I am.
Don't be daft.
Cos I were thinking like maybe
I sort of made you do it.
No, Ed.
Couldn't have stopped at home,
could I?
Oh, you could have.
You're not of age, you could
have stopped home another year.
No.
Not with you out here, mate.
Look...
honestly...
I wouldn't have missed it.
Not for t'world.
Thanks, kid.
Night, Ed.
Stand to.
Come on, now. Stand to.
Stand to!
Wakey, wakey, come on there!
- Come on, wake up.
- Alright, Sarge.
Stand to! Stand to, you dirty,
smelly bastards! Stand to!
Wakey, wakey, come on!
Stand to!
Why are we doing this,
Macfarlane?
Explain.
Why? Why?
Stand to, innit?
It's in case they attack.
Yeah, but we're gonna
attack them.
Tomorrow.
Or the day after.
They know that.
- Why would they attack us when...
- Oi, you lot!
Shut it, down there!
Some of these men are
improperly dressed, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
What's he waiting for?
- Pillock.
- The all clear.
Once we've got that,
it's brekky.
Go on, have a look, Macfarlane.
Tell us what you see.
Don't be daft.
Stand down, C coy.
Stand down.
Go on, have a look, Macfarlane.
Don't you want to know
what the German lines look like?
Go on, Eddie.
Just a quick look, Ed, yeah?
I'll tell you what,
I'll give you two bob.
Well, you look if you want to.
I would, but it's right
in front of you, mate.
Two bob mind, no tick.
Two bob's yours, Ed, it's yours.
Tell us what it looks like.
Nothing much.
Looks like a grassy hill.
See a bit of earth at the top.
Bit of their wire.
Is that all?
It's like a hill going up to
the lip of a quarry.
Far off, like.
Quarter of a mile.
Grass is blowing.
Sort of calm.
Like a sloping meadow.
Sloping up.
Gentle.
That ain't worth two bob,
sunshine.
Yes, it...
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck was that?
Who's firing?
He's down here!
Out the way!
Stretcher bearer!
- Eddie?
- Stretcher bearer!
Get him back!
Get him back!
Stretcher bearer!
Eddie!
Eddie!
Stretcher bearer! Get a fucking
stretcher bearer now!
- It's OK, OK...
- Stretcher bearer!
- Petticoat Lane!
- Come here!
Eddie!
You're alright...
He'll be alright.
He's dead... is he dead?
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...
Off we go. Out the way now.
Stretcher bearer, make way!
I'm coming through.
He was fucking stupid.
Fucking stupid!
He was fucking stupid
because he didn't fucking
listen to me!
He was fucking lucky.
What did you say?
Think about it, Billy.
- Didn't listen to me!
- He was lucky.
Was this your bright idea,
Corporal?
I... I don't know
what happened, Sarge.
He heard the all clear.
He looked out the loophole
and then bang.
You've got a cut there.
It's a little present
from Macfarlane.
I think Eddie'll be alright.
Looks worse than it was.
Don't forget
young Dell here's
got a head wound too.
Oh, I'm sure I saw
a little drop of blood and all.
I could be bloody scarred
for life.
Aw...
Here, Dell, was it a molar
or an incisor?
Tell your grandchildren...
"I was wounded by a flying tooth
at the big push."
Why don't you fuck off,
Hogg-shit?
It was your filthy pictures,
Dell...
brought us all bad luck.
Why don't you piss off back
to Sunday school, eh?
Yeah, Dell, your dirty pictures
they put a curse on us!
Shouldn't have brought them up
to the line.
- Yeah, Dell.
- Yeah.
You should nae brought them
up to the line.
God knows what the rest of you
have got in your kit.
None of your business, son.
Just smutty pictures,
that's all.
Jesus...
just a little bit of fun.
You bunch of fucking idiots.
Tosser.
I've never smoked
before but I think
now's about the time to start.
We'll turn you
into a man, son.
We can't let all standards
go by the board.
Can we, Macfarlane?
Look there, Sarge,
he's gone green!
Do you want any tea, Macfarlane?
Sorry about your brother.
Think about it though,
could be a stroke of luck.
Nice Blighty.
- What?
- You know.
Get home, rest up a few months
well out of this scrap.
He doesn't want a Blighty,
Dennis.
He'll be sick to miss it.
He was a nice bloke.
Easy going,
not like some of the others...
- He's not dead, Dennis.
- I know.
I know, sorry.
But he, um...
he asked me
to keep an eye out for ya
if anything happened to him.
When'd he ever speak to you?
He did.
Told me how he got you
to sign up.
You listen...
I've left school, Dennis.
I've got a job.
I'm 18.
Alright?
If you ever need a chat.
Um...
Fucking bugger off,
you poxy little...
I know you're upset.
No hard feelings.
Move it, you lot!
We few...
we happy few.
We band of brothers.
How old you say you were?
Right, who...
Who took it?
Who fucking took it?
One of you bastards has been
in my kit.
Who fucking took it, eh?
What you talking about,
you fucking bampot?
I had six photos in here,
now there's five.
One of you arsehole bastards
has been in my kit.
Who fucking took it, eh?
Oh, Dell. Her heart must belong
to another, eh boy?
Aye, she didnae like you.
She's buggered off home.
It was you weren't it,
you big fat bumpkin?
Hey. Watch your lip, piss face.
I saw you looking at 'em.
Staring at 'em.
Couldn't believe
your big fat eyes, could ya?
You've never seen the like.
Innocent big eyes
staring at a few titties.
I'll fucking wallop you, Dell!
I don't need your filthy
pictures.
I'm engaged.
I'm engaged to be married, me.
You're what?
You have a fiancÃ©e, Beckwith?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well who stole
my photograph?
Oh, shut it, Dell.
When were you engaged?
Jesus!
Last leave.
Engaged? You?
Who to?
Amy.
Amy.
For God's sake, Horace,
why didn't you tell me?
I was going to, honest.
It was just so sudden, like.
It was last leave and all.
She was a friend of mine too,
you know, for Christ's sake.
She said she'd write to you.
Oh, bloody fucking marvellous!
And you were just sitting there!
Yeah, well, this is all
very lovely and romantic
but we've still got a fucking
thief in this platoon.
Why don't you shut your
wily gob, Dell?
You keep telling me to shut up,
Daventry.
What have you got to hide, eh?
- You don't scare me.
- On your feet!
- Colonel coming through.
- Watch out. Winter.
On your feet,
colonel in the trench.
Oi.
Smarten yourself up, you lot.
You look like a bunch
of fucking tinkers.
Button that up!
Dennis! Dennis, clear that
fucking mess up!
Yes.
Alright, gobshites.
Attention!
- Sergeant.
- Sir.
At ease, at ease.
Sergeant, please allow
the men to smoke.
Sir.
- Got a snout?
- Anyone want a cig?
Anyone got a light?
Got a light, mate?
Now then, Faithful, what sort
of thing were you after?
Well, sir, if you'd like
to go over there.
Hogg, can I get a smoke?
Get your own smokes.
If you could bring up your knee,
that would be lovely.
Um, excuse me...
Could you stand up and move in
a little bit, please?
Thank you.
If you could take a step
forward, Colonel?
What do you, uh,
expect me to say?
Ah, sir...
Well, the caption reads...
"Senior officer addresses men,
on eve of the battle.
Morale is high."
You could say anything
you like, sir.
Something uplifting, perhaps.
- Ready, Geoffrey?
- Ready when you are, Harold.
Colonel Villiers.
Men, the battalion's objectives
are the enemy lines in front
of the village of Montauban.
- I want to tell you...
- Sorry.
Sir, could we start again?
I knocked my hand.
Could we, uh, start again, sir?
I don't have to
repeat myself, surely?
No, sir. Just start talking
whenever you're ready.
Right, would you give me
a signal, please?
Geoffrey?
Ready when you are, Harold.
In your own time,
Colonel Villiers.
I want to assure you men
that after the bombardment
you have seen
you'll be able to go over
the top with a walking stick.
And when you get to Montauban
you'll find that the Germans
are all dead.
Not even a...
not even a rat
will have survived.
Shall I continue?
Oh, please, sir.
Now, we will have control
of Montauban village
by 11am.
The field kitchens
will be following
and be able to provide you all
with a hot meal.
I want to assure you men...
that success is guaranteed.
Casualties are expected to be
no more than 10%.
In fact, when you...
when you set off over the top
you'll be able to slope arms
light your pipes,
your cigarettes
and march all the way to Bapaume
before you meet a single...
live German.
Thumbs up, hats off.
Big cheer!
Thank you, Colonel.
That was wonderful.
We'll have you
in the flickers yet, sir.
Mm...
Over my dead body!
Yes...
Now, you fellows
finished with me?
One more thing, sir.
Inspection of the casualty
clearing station.
Right, shall we go?
Thank you, men.
Good luck.
We'll give them hell, sir!
Yes!
Yes, well done. Oh, and uh...
and look here...
I want you lads to win
as many medals
for the battalion as possible.
It's alright for
you, you won't be there.
No, I won't be.
But you lot will.
Stand up!
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Sir.
Carry on, Sergeant.
Well done, boys.
Daventry...
you come with me.
You've had it now, mate.
C company, over here!
Stand at ease. Stand easy.
I'm watching you carefully,
Daventry.
You don't make one more mistake.
Not one.
And you never ever say
anything like that again...
or I'll break you.
I'll fucking break you,
Daventry.
No, but what actually happened?
Well...
they were marching us
over this hill, right?
About...
Fuck, about a mile behind
the lines, eh? That right, Rag?
That's right, yeah.
About a mile.
You could actually see the
German lines. We were just...
walking along, chatting like.
Next thing...
Bang, out of the blue
boys start screaming,
falling over, dying.
Jesus wept.
Couldn't hear a fucking sound.
Bullets just whizzing by.
Boys just...
screaming, running everywhere.
And what was it?
Jerry.
Fuckers seen us marching
over the hill.
Put a machine gun
at high elevation.
Good night.
Over a mile away, that's why
we couldn't hear the shots.
Fuck me.
What d'you do?
Me and Rag here just ran
like hell, isn't that right?
We were lucky.
A lot of boys got it that day.
Fucking lot of boys.
We were fucking lucky.
...dance last Saturday.
I don't believe you.
It was so sudden.
I told you.
Oh, come on, George.
It was just so sudden like.
We were just there
and I was having to go back
few days left of leave,
we just thought...
half our family
don't even know yet.
You could have told me.
I'm your best bloody friend!
Blurting it out like that.
How do you think I feel?
When you've finished, Hogg.
Ration party.
Ambrose, Rookwood, go with Hogg.
And you lot, fuck off.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Mm.
Why d'you call him "Rag"?
Cos he's a raggedy-arsed
sort of a fella.
Hey. Know why I call him
"Charlie"?
No, why?
Cos his name's Charlie.
I'm not happy about this,
Horace.
I'm still not happy.
Oh, come on, George,
we've been courting for a year!
What do you mean,
he owes you 2,000 pound?
From playing cards?
That stupid game?
That's me winnings,
fair and square.
Double or quits
when we get back, right?
I'll be a rich man when this
war's over, I tell you.
Will you teach me to play?
I was just having
quite a nice dream then.
I was in Southport.
On the prom.
With a rather charming
young lady.
Daventry?
Do you think, right...
sort of an idea.
That it's possible
just to meet someone
just the one time...
and say, like, maybe...
I don't know, two,
three sentences, but...
not of anything important,
like...
but still for that to be
something special and that.
Sort of...
thing.
Fascinating
question, Macfarlane.
You're talking nonsense,
gibberish!
Spit it out, man.
I met someone once, right?
I only said a few words, but...
you know, I felt something
special between us.
Well...
the phenomenon, Billy...
is known as
"love at first sight".
Yeah, I know that.
But I'm pretty sure it were
on both sides, like.
Oh?
So the young lady reciprocated?
Well, no.
No, I just said she...
felt the same.
And, uh...
and what was said
on this momentous encounter?
I remember exactly.
I said to her...
I said...
Could I have a shilling
postal order, please, Miss?
Right.
What did "Juliet" say to you?
No, she were called Maria.
Maria Corrigan.
She said...
now, I think this is right.
She said...
Jesus, what the fuck was that?
What was that?
Are they firing back?
I thought that wasn't allowed.
Macfarlane.
Get down to battalion reserve.
Hurry up that ration party.
- Give them a hand.
- Sarge.
To, uh...
to be continued, young Billy.
Come on, hurry up.
And you, go and relieve Digby.
- Alright, son?
- Hello, Billy.
Hoggy?
Sarge!
Where the fuck have you been,
Macfarlane?
Get up.
- Sir...
- What is it, lad?
Come on, good God, what is it?
Come on, spit it out!
Macfarlane, I'm...
- Jesus.
- Good God.
What is it, man?
Come here.
Billy, Billy!
- Billy?
- What is it?
Oh, he's alright.
Just shook him up a bit.
Yes, I can imagine.
Bad business, bad luck.
And it all comes down
to luck in the end, doesn't it?
What do you mean?
Well, everything.
I chose those three
for the ration party.
It could've been anybody.
Good luck on those
I didn't choose.
Bad luck on those I did.
Feels a bit brutal.
It makes no sense.
I mean, who's to say what
good luck's controlling me?
Or you, sir.
Us.
I don't suppose you ever
expected to end up here.
No.
I was rather hoping to farm
cotton in South Africa
actually, see.
There you go.
What about you?
Doesn't come into it.
I'm a professional soldier.
Mm.
I see.
- You alright?
- Mm, fine, thank you. Fine.
Fine.
Do you like fishing, Sergeant?
Don't mind a spot of fishing.
It's what I miss.
My people had a place
up in Scotland
and did a lot of fishing there.
I miss my fishing.
I've never been to Scotland.
Very bonnie place, I'm told.
Oh, yes.
You a married man, Sergeant?
I am, yes.
Children?
Two girls, one boy.
Excellent.
Handsome family.
Pretty girls.
Lucky man, Sergeant, lucky man.
Anything I can do for you, sir?
Excuse me.
It seems the Germans have
dug a trench just forward
opposite us, sort of
a listening post perhaps.
Captain's asked that
we send out a patrol
to investigate, check the wire
take care of it
if it's occupied
that sort of thing, you see.
Patrol.
- How many men?
- As few...
or as many as we want.
It's something that we... I...
have to deal with tonight,
before the attack.
Well...
you've done this sort of thing
before, haven't you?
Many times.
Dim your lights now!
Billy.
What?
You alright?
Yeah.
Poor old Rag and Charlie, eh?
"We were fuckin' lucky".
Direct hit, was it?
It were just, um...
a mess.
Rag and Charlie...
there was nothing left.
Did you, uh...
did you see anything of Hoggy?
Um...
He were just lying
to one side, like.
Upsets me, that.
That we didnae get
things sorted.
Your impending nuptials?
I know what that means,
Daventry.
I'm sure you do.
You think it's funny
to say that?
- You think it's clever?
- On the contrary...
Well, it's no fucking funny,
Daventry.
Hoggy's dead.
You're alive.
Aye.
But for how fucking long, eh?
Macfarlane, come here.
Sarky bastard.
He's a bit too full of himself,
that one.
Good old George.
Have to kill
a few more Germans now.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
Yes, Sarge.
You brother's in a base hospital
at Etaples.
He's gonna talk funny for the
rest of his life, but he's fine.
Be back home soon.
Thanks, Sarge.
It's good news.
You better get his kit together.
Bundle it up. Beckwith!
You come with me.
Billy.
Were they all really minced up?
- Little pieces...
- I don't wanna
talk about it anymore,
alright? So just fuck off.
Is that enough, Sarge?
Black as the ace of spades,
Beckwith.
Give him your bombs.
When you see mine go off,
chuck in yours after.
Right, Sarge. Definitely.
And if this gets broken,
head for home
otherwise you're
with me all the way.
Right, sir.
We'll be off.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Good luck to you.
- Sir.
Right, shall we, uh...
We need a password
for coming back in.
How about "Shakespeare"?
"Victor Ludorum"?
"Post Office".
"Post Office", it is.
Corporal, you put up a flare
every 15 minutes.
- Got it?
- Sarge.
Snout.
Sarge.
Alright, Beckwith.
Let's sort this lot out.
Every 15 minutes,
you send up a...
a green flare.
Every... every 15 minutes.
Yes, sir.
He's a bit of a fucking idiot,
that Mr Harte, isn't he?
Damn right.
He can't help it.
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?
Well, he were bred that way.
Oh, right.
No, can't see a thing.
Jesus Christ!
What the fucking hell was that?
- That's English.
- It's not English.
Oh, God.
What if it's Beckwith
and Winter?
Jesus!
Fuck, I hope they're alright.
- Got two left now.
- Yeah.
Post Office.
Post Office!
Post Office.
Post Office! Here, over here!
They're back!
Go and tell Harte, Cornwallis.
Post Office!
We've got a surprise for you,
boys.
Get in there!
Ich kann auch nichts dafuer.
Nein, oh, nein.
Lass mich in Ruhe.
- Nein! Tut mir nichts.
- Get up!
Nein!
Keep still! Keep still!
Shut up!
- Kamerad...
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!
Keep your
hands up above the wire!
Get the flare up!
Put a guard on him.
I'll be back in a tick.
Come on! Somebody put
a fucking gun on him!
Nein. Das ist doch Wahnsinn.
He was wandering about
all over the place
after Winter threw the bombs in.
Didnae know
where the fuck he was going.
Ran right into us.
Here you go.
What about the noise?
The man screaming?
I couldn't hear
fucking anything.
I was sort of deaf
with all the bombs.
Maybe it was one of the Huns
in the sap.
It was Winter who threw
the bombs in.
Couldn't hear anything
after the explosions.
Funny thing...
when we got close to their lines
I could hear them like, singing.
Like, underground
in their dug-outs.
Singing?
Yeah, well.
Keeping their spirits up.
It must be fucking murder
after five days.
Singing?
What about the wire?
There's still a fucking lot
of wire left.
After this barrage?
Jesus, what's going on?
It must be fucking
murder in those trenches.
Aye, look at the state
of that one.
Shivering like a fucking rabbit
or something.
Like a fucking rat!
Jesus Christ...
You fools.
What?
Nothing's working.
They're just sitting there.
Waiting for us.
Oi.
Oi!
I'm talking to you.
Was you singing?
- Was ya?
- Kamerad...
Yeah?
Fucking have him!
Don't you fucking want
to get him?
You won't be singing tomorrow!
There's no two ways about that.
- Just leave it!
- It's alright.
I had a rush of blood,
that's all.
That's all it was.
We should fucking kill him,
what's the matter with yous?
- He's a fucking Germ...
- Just leave it.
Just leave it.
Here y'are.
Here.
Have a gasper.
Don't worry about him, he's
a nasty little toerag, huh?
Go on, I got loads.
That's it.
Dankeschoen.
Is good.
English tobacco, mate.
Best in the world.
Was ist dein Name?
Zimmermann.
Dieter Zimmermann.
Dieter.
Mein Name ist Colin.
Come on. Steady on, Daventry.
Fraternising with the enemy?
Terrible crime,
isn't it, Beckwith?
He's the lucky one, mate.
We're the poor fucking idiots.
You wait and see.
What's got into him?
Oh, God knows.
He's an odd bugger.
Fuck, here's Winter...
Beckwith.
We're taking him down the line.
Come on.
Up! Come on!
- Go on.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.
- Cheerio, Dieter!
Shut up!
Fucking shut up.
Billy.
Sarge?
What you doing?
Just going to latrine, Sarge.
Try and get some sleep, eh?
I'm trying.
I just can't stop...
my mind's...
I just can't stop thinking.
Yeah.
Yeah, know what you mean.
Do you want some jam?
My wife made it.
I was trying to finish it off
but there's a bit too much.
Strawberry, from me own garden.
It's delicious.
Nah, thanks, Sarge.
Thanks all the same, like.
Here, go on.
Best jam in the world,
my wife's jam.
Whole strawberries.
- Help yourself, I'm stuffed.
- Don't like 'em, Sarge.
Don't be daft!
Everyone likes strawberries!
No, I don't. I don't... the...
little pip things, they get
stuck in your teeth, don't they?
Yeah.
Go on.
Go on.
Jesus!
Jesus, fuck!
- You fucking...
- Come here.
Come on, come here.
You're the fucking thief, Dell!
Come here.
What are you doing
in our Eddie's pack?
I'll fucking kill ya!
He's the fucking thief,
he's got my photo in there
- I know he has.
- You liar, you fucking liar!
Fucking madman!
Now, calm down. What's...
What's going on?
Get off me, get off me!
He was stealing
from our Eddie's pack.
Alright, alright, listen...
listen to me, right?
His brother's got my fucking
photo in there.
I'm telling you now.
Right, search all you want.
But don't apologise to me,
apologise to Eddie.
Fucking move...
I'll fucking kill ya!
Go on, fuck off. Yeah, go on.
Alright, I'm alright,
I'm alright.
I'm alright, I'm alright.
I'm alright.
Just having a look,
that's all, boys.
No harm in that, is there?
Eh? Eh?
You prick, Dell.
- You fucking prick.
- What?
Go on, fuck off then,
the lot o' ya!
I don't fucking need yous.
You're in the fucking way.
Who you fucking looking at, eh?
Morning, boys.
Look sharp there.
- Wakey, wakey, Beckwith.
- Sarge.
- Rise and shine.
- Alright, Sarge.
Look sharp, Daventry.
Come on, shake a leg.
See ya later, mate.
Where is he?
He's back in reserve.
Company orders.
Make sure that gets off,
will you, Bone?
- Hey, I'm going over wi' you lot.
- What?
Why?
Well, I think... I think
Mr Harte would like it.
Well, have you told him?
No, it'll be a surprise.
I'll make him a cuppa in
t'German lines, eh?
Right, fine.
Looks like it could be
a lovely day.
Well...
You know...
in any other circumstances.
Seven thirty.
Seven thirty.
But that's broad daylight.
All to do with the timing
of the barrage.
Been the same for the past
six days. Can't change it.
Can we get this food
out of here, please!
Right, sir.
Right away, sir.
I s-s-seem to have
lost my appetite.
Yeah, well, you don't want a
full stomach on a day like this.
No.
I never eat a thing.
Very wise.
There's something else, um...
There's been a change...
change, change of order.
A sort of cock-up really,
actually, so...
It appears that two companies
managed to get lost
in the night, so...
wrong communication trench,
uh...
ridiculous.
Uh, so we're short-handed and...
the platoon's going over
with the rest of the company.
First wave.
That's not good.
Not with this lot.
There is nothing...
nothing we can do.
There's been a change...
in the order
and the men will have to...
The men will have to...
Yes, there's one other thing.
Captain Furnival has given
each platoon
a football.
First platoon to kick it
into German lines
gets a barrel of beer.
Captain Furnival thought
it would be good for morale.
"A bit of fun", he said.
Smart idea.
This lot ready by seven then.
We'll need that rum now, sir.
Yes, of course.
Will you see to it, Sergeant?
What the fuck was that?
Where the fuck
did that come from?
Jesus Christ!
God, Jesus!
It was...
It was an accident, Sarge.
I was... I was propping my gun
against the wall
and it fell over!
Oh, it was, it was...
It was an accident, Sarge!
God! No!
You're a dead man now,
Cornwallis.
I can't believe he'd do that.
All the same, these types
they're full of piss and vinegar
till it comes to the crunch.
It's gotta be a court martial.
Firing squad. There's
no two ways about it.
Do you think he knew summat?
I mean, why would he do
a thing like that?
Want me to tell you why, Bone,
my old son?
Cos he ain't a red-blooded hero
like me and you, mate.
That's why.
Dell!
Get down company stores,
draw the rum ration.
Quick as you like.
Bone will tell you where it is.
What, now, Sarge?
Corporal, I want you back here
in 15 minutes. Double!
Beckwith,
got a little present for you.
I tell you what,
my back's killing me.
Hey, Billy!
That barrel of beer's
as good as won, pal.
That's our guns, our guns!
My God!
Jesus!
Where do you think you're going,
sonny Jim?
Look, I gotta get through here,
mate.
Look, I got the rum ration here.
There's a whole battalion
between me and there, "mate".
Fucking...
Stay back, stay back!
Lewis gun coming through.
Stand back, mind your backs!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Move it!
Mind your back there!
Come on! Move it!
Oh, where's my...
where's my leg?
Wounded coming through!
Oh, shit!
Into position, now!
Come on, lads...
- Bone!
- Sarge?
Are you sure you gave Dell
the right directions?
Well, he couldn't miss it,
Sarge.
Not even in the dark,
he couldn't miss it.
The little shithead.
Mr Harte, how much whiskey
has he got?
I wouldn't know, Sarge.
How much fucking whiskey
has he got?
Two... two bottles, Sarge.
Two and a bit.
Good lad.
Sarge...
The explosion, Sarge...
Sergeant...
Sarge, Sarge...
No.
You're coming with us, sonny.
Beckwith!
Come on, at the fucking double!
Sort him out!
Oi!
We'll look after him...
What's going on?
What do you want?
There's no rum.
The ration's been lost.
Permission to use your whiskey,
sir.
What are you talking about?
Certainly not.
Oh, for fuck's sake, these men
cannot go over without rum!
We'll give them all a tot
of your whiskey.
Dutch courage. They'll not go
five yards without it.
Sergeant.
Permission to use your whiskey,
sir.
I will send Bone back to get it.
No.
Out of the question.
Permission refused.
I said no.
You know it works.
- Offer it!
- I warn you.
"With the Lieutenant's
compliments."
- I warn you, Sergeant.
- They'll follow you anywhere.
To hell and back.
At any other time...
I would have you arrested
and charged.
Sarge?
What?
Sarge, you've been over before,
ain't you?
Yes.
Sir, what's it like?
You don't wanna think about it.
Keep your mind on the job.
No, I mean...
I mean, is it scary?
Yes, it is.
You don't have time
to be frightened for long.
It's too...
It's too strange.
When you go over the top,
you're in another world.
With the Lieutenant's
compliments.
It's a place where nothing...
With the Lieutenant's
compliments.
With the Lieutenant's
compliments.
Thanks very much, sir.
Thanks, Bone.
With the Lieutenant's
compliments.
- Bloody hell!
- Cheers, sir.
Jesus Christ!
Nothing for you, Sergeant?
Not even on a day like today?
No.
Thank you, sir.
That's the lot, sir.
Good, you can get back
to reserve.
No, uh...
I'm coming with you, sir.
How you gonna get your tea
otherwise, eh, sir?
Uh...
Fine. Good, good.
Thank you.
Open out! Open out!
Right, budge up, men.
Move there!
Mind your backs!
Mind your backs!
Ladder coming through here.
- Right.
- On it, lads!
Budge up!
Ladders, up!
Fix bayonets!
Fix!
Bayonets!
Horace, Horace.
I'm in a really bad fucking way,
Horace.
Horace...
I can't do it. I can't.
I can't go.
Oh, fuck...
Look, you're gonna be alright
with me, Vic.
- I can't do it.
- Oh, come on!
- Can't...
- Oh, fucking hell.
Come on!
Yea, though I walk through
the valley
of the shadow of death...
I will fear no evil.
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me...
Thou shalt prepare a table
before me...
- against them that trouble me.
- Best of luck, mate.
Thou hast anointed
my head with oil
and my cup shall be full.
Thy loving kindness shall follow
me all the days of my life.
You stick with me.
I'll see you alright.
I'm up first, you're right
behind me, Macfarlane.
Yes, Sarge.
You alright?
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel good.
Well, ready for it anyway.
Good and ready.
That's the spirit.
That your sweetheart?
Yeah.
She's called Maria.
She works in't post office.
Um...
So, what do we do now, Sarge?
We wait.
- Hey, Sarge.
- What?
One thing's worrying me, Sarge.
What if...
something should happen?
Might happen to me.
Might even...
Gotta say it, Sarge,
it's on my mind.
It's bothering me.
You'll get through.
Don't worry, son.
I can always tell.
I know the type
that gets through.
And you're...
Right, out! Out!
Out! Out! Out!
Move it!
Come on, lads!
Move it, you bastards!
Out! Out!
Up you go! Up you go, lads!
Out! Out! Out! Out!
Keep going there, keep going!
Out! Out!
Come on, Billy, for fuck's sake!
Get up here, Macfarlane!
Or I'll fucking shoot you!
Get up here now!
Men! Keep moving!
Come on, lads, keep moving!
