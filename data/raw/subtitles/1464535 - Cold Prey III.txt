What the little freak is doing here?
He has not seen daylight for days.
He should not be here.
-Gunnar!
-No!
Mom! Mom!
-Mom!
-Shut up!
Shut up!
Let me go!
You fuck! I am not your father!
The search for an 11-year-old boy continues
-He haven't been seen for two days.
He disappeared  around
mood somber mountain hotel.
We assume the boy did not survive out in the cold.
The search have been extend to the surroundings of the hotel-
-But search ends tonight.
Rescuers believe
he died in an avalanche.
parents said
the boy went out to play-
-But he never came back.
Hello.
It's been a while.
What do you want?
Sigrid's boy, Gunnar have not  been
seen for two and a half days.
I thought he might
have tried to come here.
-No.
-No one can make it in that cold.
Our father is dying, Jon.
He has not many hours left.
I neither want to see you, him or
some of the fucking hypocrites down there!
You got that?
Cold Prey lll
Hello?
Gunnar?
My boy, you are alive!
Sigrid?
12 years later
Hey!
Very funny.
You are going to the mountains to get fresh air?
Just to take a walk in the park Park.
What are you coming here for, then?
We're not going anywhere special.
Just sleep under the stars.
Thank you very much for the lift.
It was very nice of you.
You may at least be left alone.
There are not many people up here.
Thanks.
-Anyone else who wants?
-No thanks.
-You had a good sleep yesterday?
-Hum, it was quite late.
Well, Magne? Did you get any yesterday?
Did you fuck?
Jon?
Need help?
I do not know if you heard,
but I have two sons.
The know they have an uncle.
This is a national park, Jon.
You know it's forbidden to hunt here.
Do you think he knows what we are up to?
He believes we came up here for the mountain.
Yes.
Check it here!
No plug it in?
-Nope.
-Call home.
Just fantastic. Can I call home?
Yes, but batterie is bad.
The car must go and give it power.
This is for hanging it up.
You don't have one!
Have you seen something like that before?
-From here, you walk, that is has far as a car can go.
-Thank you, thank you.
This is perfect.
Norwegian nature.
Here you get nothing;
but a few hours' walk this way-
-There are good fishing spots,
around here fish are biting.
-What?
-Fishing?
Thanks.
It's true! The bus driver's wife
has a 50th birthday party tonight.
I don't think any coach goes tomorrow.
But I can be here at two.
-Thanks.
-Thanks for that.
It takes six hours to get there.
Oh, my God!
Do you want water, Knut?
-Yes please.
-Why not?
I might hit a sweet girl.
-No.
-Yes!
Does the nerd got on dry socks?
Ready for dripping cystitis.
Come on, let's go!
How far is it?
We are here. We're over the hill.
Then we go a little further,
that way and there we are.
There is nothing there.
It has been erased, after everything that happened.
They erased it from the map.
So nobody could get back there.
-Simen, this map is from 1930.
-And?
What exactly happened?
The kid went out and played.
Then he never returned.
He died in an avalanche. Or how, Knut?
That's right.
-They never found him?
No. Not the parents, either.
They disappeared a few days later.
They did not found any trace of them.
I heard that the Restless
are still wandering around here.
-Simen ...
- Around the hotel?
I think we found it.
Shall we go?
It's fine here.
We light the stove and dust.
It will be nice.
Fuck the hell!
You bastard.
Let's see if we can find firewood?
Siri, felling o.k.?
Siri?
-No, I do not want.
-Want what?
I don't want to stay here.
I do not like it. It's disgusting.
I don't want.
Fantastic!
Okay, let's go back home.
She says that she don't want to stay here.
Shit! It's a rat.
It' safe here.
The place has been empty for ten years.
What? I do not sleep here.
-Me neither.
What is it?! Damn, we walked
half the day to come here.
We are here.
Why can't we find a place to camp?
And light a fire.
We have no tents.
-The sun shines. It is not necessary, it wont rain.
We will be fine.
Come on, guys.
Fucking sissies.
Does anyone have mosquito spray?
I just took my game with me.
Doing o.k.?
There is no danger.
-Look!
-It is amazing.
God, so nice!
My turn!
Come on, Anders!
I want to swim. Come!
What the hell, Magne ...
Come on, Magne!
Thank for asking the others to
bring me along.
It was incredibly nice.
It made me so happy.
Is there anything wrong? You seem so worried.
I'm just pretty damn nervous.
Is it good or bad?
It is good.
It's actually very good.
-You're freezing.
-Thanks!
We can jump out there.
Come with me?
No! Magne and put back
your pants on.
You ...
I am extremely hungry.
-What do we have? Anders?
-Anders, you were in charge of the food.
-No, I would ...
You did not bring any food?
Okay, what are you doing?
Cold burgers?
What? It covers the whole food groups.
Meat, tomato, onion
Cheese, bread, sugar, tomato ...
With some beer.
-Whats here.
Six-beer?
There is one beer per head.
-Bowl for us.
-Cheers!
Come ...
How romantic!
Where Knut and Siri are going?
Heu... picking mushrooms?
B... In the trees?
Or C..
In the wilderness, in the nature ...

-Great!
-Thanks for your fantasies.

-How many are you?
-Six.
We must find him.
I'll help you.
Stay here.
Do you understand what you have done?
It is a human being, not an animal!
You are a fucking idiot.
Fucking freak!
Clean up this mess.
What if somebody saw you!
Have you thought about it?
Have you thought about it!
No!
No! No, let me go!
Let go!
No!
Anders?
Anders!
Simen ...
Nice! Now you scared it of.
Put it away, Simen!
Put the gun away.
We decided to make it a short trip
Pack what we need for a few hours.
And you decided to bring a gun.
It's an AG3.
-Where did you get that?
I joined the Home Guard.
Why did you bring that here?
You never know when the Russians will attack.
What are S, E and F?
Solo, Enemies and Family.
If you would kill a bachelor
, put it on S.
If you kill the mother, father and one, four children
-Insert it in F.
Were did we find this guy?
-You are sick in the head.
-Yes, it's me.
-Where are Knut and Siri?
They probably chose Option C.
Siri!
Now we can forget meeting the police for the ride.
Magne, relax!
I will carry you from here.
I don't like this anymore ...
Hello! Is anybody there?
Knut?
Hello?
Hedda?
Damn, Simen!
Are you stupid?
You might have shot someone.
Simen?
Come! Run!
-What is it?
-Run!

Hedda!

He lies against a tree.
Then he came after me.
After killing Simen.

Help!
Shut up.
So, so ...
That's fine.
Yes ...
Yes. So yes.
So, so, so ...
Hey, it's me. He was not home.
They did not.
They might had a ride with someone else.
Stop, Magne!
Magne!
How long should we sit here?
I get claustrophobic.
Magne, what are you doing?
Come back down!
Magne!
No!
Over on the other side.
We can swim across!
Anders!
Come on! Come on!
No!
Anders!

Hedda, you must find Magne.
We must find a hideout

Give me your hand. We must hurry.
Does it hurt?
