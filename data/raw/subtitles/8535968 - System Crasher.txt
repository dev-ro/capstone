Looks good, Benni.
How are the meds?
- Fine.
- You're taking them regularly?
You can get dressed now.
Careful.
We're going to increase your dosage.
It'll help you stay in control
when you get angry.
If you notice you're very tired,
or are losing your appetite,
let me know, OK?
- Back in school already?
- Nope.
She's still suspended.
It's for retards, anyway.
Give it a chance.
You're a smart kid.
- I know.
- What do you want to be?
An educator.
Are you out of your minds?
Benni!
- Calm down right now, you hear?
- They started it!
- I don't give a shit!
- Everyone inside!
Get lost now, all of you!
- Come along, kids.
- Need an invite or what?
Benni, you're staying here
till you're calm, got it?
And when you're calm,
I'll come and get you.
You cunts! Piss off!
Assholes!
- Will it hold?
- Don't worry, it's shatterproof.
I hate you!
SYSTEM CRASHER
Would you like a drink?
You do know why you're here today?
Benni, this was your third warning.
Yeah, you want to kick me out again.
Do you understand, Benni?
You understand
why you can't stay here any longer?
Benni, cut it out with the lollipop.
Mrs. Redekamp asked you a question.
Do you understand?
I don't care.
Mrs. Bafané will take you
to a new group home.
I don't want a new group home!
I want to live with Mama!
That's not possible.
You know how that ended
the last couple times.
I hate you all.
Benni,
we've been very patient with you.
- I don't give a shit.
- Wow, great.
How many group homes
do you want to try out?
Wolfgang...
Can I go to the bathroom?
Dennis...
Don't let it get to you, Wolfgang.
She needs another framework.
Sometimes I wish
we could still lock kids up.
Shit.
Come back!
Hello! Hello there!
How are you today?
Nice weather, right? The sun's shining.
Why don't you answer, asshole?
Nice wheels, real fast!
Have a nice fucking day!
Look who's here.
- Kicked out again, psycho?
- Shut your mouth!
Whore!
Fuck you!
- Want to see this psycho flip out?
- Shut your trap, pussy!
Touch her face.
I'll kill you in a heartbeat!
Ed-u-ca-tor!
Ed-u-ca-tor!
- What's the matter, Benni?
- My bed is wet.
There...
So good night again.
Stay here, educator.
You know my name, Benni.
At Mama's,
I'm allowed to watch TV to fall asleep.
But you know our rules here.
Where will I be placed now?
I don't know.
Mrs. Bafané will find something for you.
But you'll have to behave well there.
There aren't many places left.
- Hi, I'm Trian.
- Marco.
- Ebou. - Amelia.
- Moritz.
- I'm Johanna.
- I'm Amila.
- Stella.
- And my humble self: Robbi.
We're "The Clique."
I'm Maria Bafané from Child Services.
And this is...
Benni.
She's shy at first, but it will pass.
No one is forced to speak here.
Sometimes I don't say a word all day.
For real.
So who will show Benni around the manor?
This is your room.
You can live here.
This is Moritz' room.
This is the TV room.
Do you like TV?
Everyone does.
Did you read about her face?
- I haven't gotten around to it.
- Don't touch it.
No way. She freaks out.
Only her mother can touch her face.
Violent early childhood trauma.
Her mother says
diapers were pushed into her face as a baby.
I have a new school escort,
a specialist anger management trainer.
For her?
He's used to working with juvenile delinquents,
he'll be able to handle her.
We're waiting for a place
in trauma therapy, but...
But?
They won't treat her
until she's in a stable home.
Commissar, Commissar,
Commissar Tentacles
Commissar, Commissar,
Commissar Tentacles...
The underwater detective
He swims in the sea all day
That's where he comes from, anyway
He may be with the vice
But he's still kind of nice
Where was Mama?
I don't know.
But I'll tell you as soon as I know.
You're so nice, Mrs. Bafané!
So are you.
So are you.
Look at me.
It's got to work this time, OK?
You don't want to go back
to the clinic, huh?
See?
Bye!
Bye.
Hello, Mrs. Klaas, this is Mrs. Bafané.
You didn't make it
to Benni's new group home today.
I think she likes it there,
but as usual I need your consent.
Please get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Bye.
Stupid cow.
You can't be fucking serious!
What shit for brains do you have
to get arrested for that?
No, sure, keep in touch with them.
Just visit the cops and say,
"Hey, here I am, just touching base.
I wanted to see if you're doing well."
Are you fucking kidding me?
I spent five hours cleaning this up!
Take care.
Educator,
you can't just come into my room.
I'm not an educator.
You still can't just come in.
- Know what kind of birds those are?
- Barn owls.
Ever seen a real one?
Yeah, at the zoo.
You've got a lot of photo albums.
I always get one
when they throw me out.
Can I see one?
Cool, you're getting acquainted.
I got tied down with Marco's math.
So, Benni, how do you like
your school escort?
I'm not going to school.
Get out!
Piss off.
Glad to meet you anyway.
Don't you want to come in?
Getting sick won't bring her here sooner.
But I want to wait here.
Can we give her another call?
Please.
- Hello, Mrs. Klaas.
- Mama!
- Hello, Mama.
- We're on the phone.
Are you still coming today?
Well, can I at least sing you a song?
I made it up myself. So...
Of all the people in the world
It's you I love most
All the way to the stars and back again
I love you more than chocolate ice-cream
And French fries
Alicia is sick.
That has priority.
Shall we go in and play, Benni?
Join the others?
What's wrong?
Kiss my ass!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
I have to get to
25 Martin Luther Street, Helmstedt.
Can you bring me there?
Please, please, please...
Young lady, you can't just get in cars
with complete strangers.
But you're nice, I can tell.
- Where are your parents?
- In Helmstedt.
I was on the train and went too far.
I forgot my backpack with my cell in it.
Shouldn't we call them?
They'll be worried.
Tomorrow is Mama's birthday
and it's supposed to be a surprise.
- My name's Friederike.
- I'm Benni.
That's a boy's name.
My real name is Bernadette,
but I hate it.
- It's a pretty name.
- No, it's so prissy.
How old are you?
Nine.
Nine and three-quarters.
I'm ten on February 23.
And you?
I'm already 54.
Thanks for taking me there.
My pleasure.
Hello, Mrs. Sander!
- Hey, shortass.
- What are you doing here?
I'm moving back in.
Take off already. Go away.
You alright?
- You can't watch this.
- Stop it!
I want to watch that,
not this shit for babies.
So?
Stop it!
Give me that, you ass.
Get off!
- Quiet down now.
- Alright, alright.
- You hungry?
- Yeah!
Well then...
Mama?
What's this?
What are you doing here, Benni?
- She's living here again.
- You what...?
Do your carers know you're here, darling?
What a surprise!
Hey, Benni. You back again?
- What's he doing here?
- Come on, Benni.
You said he didn't live here.
Just for a few days.
He's moving out soon, Benni.
Calm down.
No need to be upset.
- Calm down, Benni.
- Quiet!
No hitting. Stop it, sweetie.
Everything's fine.
- Stop it, Benni.
- Get lost.
- Out of the way.
- Get lost!
- Benni, behave yourself.
- Shut your fucking trap!
Benni, I have to call your carers.
- No!
- Don't talk to your mother like that.
- I think I have to. Or I'll call your group home.
- No!
Don't do that!
- Benni!
- Asshole!
Out the way, for fuck's sake!
How often do I have to say it?
Move it!
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- You can't treat adults like this.
You pussy hole!
- Please, no.
- Leave your mom in peace!
You're driving her crazy!
Now call the fucking cops!
Hello, Benni?
This is the police.
Don't worry, we're letting you out now.
Let go, darling.
You have to let go of me, Benni.
I'll come and visit you very soon,
little lady.
I promise.
Come here,
I want to tell you something.
Keep your spirits up, OK?
You can do it.
I know you can.
Why can Leo and Alicia stay
but I can't?
Darling, I can't explain that to you now.
It's...
- I can't do anything about it.
- Why not?
Child Services says so, you know?
If you... If you...
behave yourself properly and...
stop flipping out,
you can come back home, I promise.
Come along, Benni.
I love you, Mama.
I love you, too.
I really do, my little lady.
Hello!
He doesn't want that.
- No!
- Benni, he's leaving now.
- I'm not going to school!
- Benni, Benni, please.
- Put the knife down.
- You asshole!
Shut your fucking trap!
Benni, please.
Put down the knife.
Don't move or I'll kill myself!
No, no!
Easy now.
Easy now.
Easy. Benni.
- Coming to the hospital?
- No, I have to look after the kids.
I'll come.
- I'll call you.
- Thanks.
- How much was she given?
- 225 mg of Disoprivan.
Benni, it's me, Dr. Schönemann.
Everything will be fine.
We'll unfasten you in a minute.
We'll put her in time-out.
Circulation is stable.
Has she been having fits
like this recently?
I don't know, I'm her school escort.
We'll have to take her as an inpatient.
But it could take a while, we're full.
- Goodbye.
- And how long will she stay?
We'll probably release her
tomorrow morning at 7.
We'll call her group home
to have her picked up.
Let's hope she can stay there.
I have to move on.
So, this time you have
a whole room to yourself.
But don't get used to the luxury.
- Can I watch TV?
- Maybe later with the others.
You're a shithead, asshole.
I missed you too, Benni.
Mrs. Bafané, can you stay here a while?
I'm afraid I can't today.
I have another child,
but I'll be back as soon as I can.
I promise.
Take care. You can do this.
Mrs. Bafané, we're an emergency shelter,
not a long-term solution.
- Benni's coming and going...
- I can't just conjure up a group home.
We can't keep saving you.
I just don't know what to do.
I've had 25 rejections.
- What about a closed facility?
- She's way too young.
I'm trying it.
- At least she'd have regular schooling.
- Then we'd...
Look at this...
- Is that a horse?
- Yes...
- Educator...
- And these are...
What's that?
Educator!
My name is Micha.
- You're here because of me.
- That's true.
Then play with me.
- And that's an eye?
- Yes, an eye.
Play with me now!
I'm not here to play,
but to escort you to school.
- Says who?
- Me.
You play table soccer?
Yeah.
Then come on.
- A game to ten for a trip to school.
- OK.
- It's a deal.
- Yeah, you're annoying.
If I win, I sit in on your class.
And if I win,
I drive in your car.
Shake on it.
And no knife.
Nope.
What are you doing?
- Scoring a goal.
- That's not fair.
You can't just tilt the table.
Play.
- ...Mario Basler.
- And what's your favorite song?
Next question.
Favorite color?
Red.
Favorite sport?
Boxing.
- Can you do a split?
- No.
Can you...
Can we go to your house afterwards?
- No, we can't.
- Why not, you're my friend!
Benni, I'm not your friend,
I'm your school escort.
Good morning, girls.
Who'll do the date today?
- Nobody.
- Benni, how about you?
- Hey, I put my hand up, too!
- But you did it on Friday, huh?
No way!
So today is...
Monday, right.
So let's write it in English.
So who'll do it?
Girls, stop it.
Benni, will you?
You've been away a while.
Will you try?
Wait, please.
- I can't, Natascha's bothering me.
- I'm not!
Will you try?
I'll write along.
Girls, please.
Great!
So a word about your homework.
I'm going to shine this light in your eyes.
You've had that before.
Open them up.
Good.
Close your eyes.
Open them.
Great, thanks. Fine.
Well done.
Now your mother will remove that from you.
It'll be fine.
I'll be gentle.
Look at me.
It'll soon be over.
Everything's fine.
Not bad at all.
The Risperdal has
an impulse-inhibiting effect on children.
It's actually a neuroleptic
for adult schizophrenics.
However, there haven't been long-term studies
in children with IQs over 80.
We need an "off-label use"
so it can be prescribed.
I need your consent, Mrs. Klaas.
I have to ask you to read the details
about possible side-effects.
You can take your time.
Can't you tell me what it says?
It infrequently leads to muscle cramps.
Particularly in the face.
Or when walking. It may look like
she's making a face or stumbling.
- Palpitations, high blood pressure...
- But... she'll be fine, right?
We're taking good care of Benni.
- I want toothpaste, too.
- Me, too.
- Stop!
- That's disgusting.
So come along then, kids.
Enes, Melissa...
That's enough now, Benni, right?
Enes, Melissa, your bus is waiting.
Let's go.
Benni, enough now.
Hurry up, the bus is waiting.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- What's for lunch?
- Spaghetti.
I want to watch TV.
Not now. This evening, Benni.
No, now!
We're changing shifts.
I hate you retards!
She pisses me off.
Here... I'm a baby!
So sweet!
My chubby cheeks.
A fat little baby.
Here we are at the park.
This was my second foster mom.
We were on the way to the farm.
She was really nice.
Her name was Sylvia.
This is Captain Hook,
my favorite of her fish.
And this was my therapy horse.
- Her name was Hekla.
- Heckler?
- It's an Icelandic name.
- Ah, Hekla.
Hekla, yes.
Because she was an Icelandic mare.
Like I thought: mailbox.
Maybe she's on her bike
and can't hear the phone.
Looking at my watch,
we'd better start without Mrs. Klaas.
We're used to that.
I need someone to take notes.
- Can I lean on you, Mrs. Roland?
- Of course.
Great. Fine. Well...
Unfortunately,
there's no good news for Benni.
I've had 37 refusals
from institutions in the area.
I've got an application pending
for exceptional admission to a closed facility.
Actually, Benni is still too young for that.
A further inpatient stay
at the psychiatric clinic is planned.
But until then, Benni will stay here
at the emergency shelter.
There should be a place
in two to three weeks.
Benni needs a long-term solution,
not the clinic again.
Her last time as an inpatient
helped quite a bit.
For a while.
I'd like to suggest
an intensive program abroad.
We've had great results
with one in Kenya.
I could ask a personal contact there.
Benni in Africa?
Seriously?
She's much too young.
Let us please work together
to find constructive ideas.
I have a suggestion.
Three weeks in the woods.
One-on-one caregiving.
I have a cabin in the Lüneburg Heath.
I take my teenagers there.
No water, no electricity.
It'll do her good.
Well? A bit of vacation?
Peace.
Think you can handle it?
I wouldn't suggest it otherwise.
Educator, educator...!
Let's go, let's go!
Hurry up, hurry up!
I want to get...
going!
Let's go!
- Benni?
- Fuck you.
Don't kill him, OK?
Buckle up, young lady.
Shitty music!
- What do you think?
- Awesome!
The keys are there.
Where's the light switch?
There's no electricity.
This is enough light.
Where's the TV?
- There isn't one.
- What do you mean? Internet?
No electricity, no internet.
And you crap in the shithouse.
You're so disgusting, Educator.
- What's my name?
- Disgusting Martian.
Now you're getting it.
Come and lend a hand.
Na, I don't wanna!
But you're gonna!
Cheers.
Is there dessert?
- But I'll bet you something.
- I'm listening.
I bet you won't last here three days.
If I win,
I never have to go back to school.
If you win,
I'll show you where the owls live.
And if you win,
I'll clean the shithouse.
You'll clean the shithouse?
The bet's on.
Was that necessary?
Pill time.
No, I don't wanna.
You can take them
outside the front door.
My third attempt.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come here, I'm sorry.
Benni, stop, I didn't...
Easy, easy, easy.
Come here, come here.
I forgot. I'm sorry.
Easy. I'm sorry. I forgot.
I forgot.
I just forgot.
I forgot, Benni.
You OK, yeah?
I wanted to get you to fetch some milk.
I don't wanna.
But you're gonna.
Are you nuts?
You'll get it!
And you? Getting some sleep?
Educator!
I wanna go home, I hate it here!
- Did you fall into the shithouse?
- Leave me alone!
Fuck you!
So?
Another disturbed child
to torment my animals?
- Benni wanted to...
- Instead of teaching kids, you cause a ruckus.
And I pay taxes for that?
Exactly right.
I'm sorry.
- Tomorrow you'll be at my calves.
- I'm sorry!
That's something.
There we go.
- Where's the milk?
- One more incident
and I'll press charges for animal abuse.
Your milk is back there.
What were you doing with your hands?
To not lose my temper.
Or I would've smacked the jerk.
Yeah, sure.
- You don't believe me?
- Nope.
- Give me the canister.
- What?
- Give it to me.
- Why?
Don't believe me?
That was cool.
I believe you.
- Can you teach me that?
- Definitely not.
- Everyone's afraid of me. Even the boys.
- Why?
If anyone bothers me,
I smack them on the nose.
And get into a world of trouble?
Mighty Mouse?
For real?
I won't get in trouble?
Get a move on or I'll do it myself.
Harder.
Busted, busted, busted!
We did it!
I'll hire you back home.
This is the best vacation I've ever had!
It's not vacation,
it's an educational measure.
Then the best educational measure.
So where are they?
They've flown off.
We must've been too loud.
Don't they feel caged in?
No, they like it nice and tight
in their little den.
The stink is their crap?
They like this, they settle in like this.
What's up there?
- A spider.
- May I?
Don't the spiders bother the owls?
No.
They're their roommates. Or dessert.
How many children
have you brought here?
Six.
Am I the worst?
No, it's a walk in the park with you,
Mighty Mouse.
I normally work with boys
who are 16 or older.
Not with tiny tots.
Micha?
Did you get into a lot of fights?
I screwed up a lot that way.
But then I got my act together
and have a job I like now.
What do you want to be?
A toilet cleaner.
I should've known.
Because I flip out,
I'm not allowed to go back to Mama.
You can change that.
That dog is mean.
No, he's not mean.
He's just doing his job.
- Get out. Out.
- No!
- Out of the bed!
- My bed's wet!
- I'll give you a new sleeping bag.
- But why? I want to sleep here!
- Go to your bed!
- I want to sleep here! In your bed!
Shit.
- Out you get.
- No!
- Out.
- Get off!
- I hate you!
- Calm down now.
- Calm down!
- I hate you!
Shit!
Come back in.
Come out, I was just surprised.
Benni, I'm sorry.
Mr. Bockelmann?
Come in.
Morning, Benni.
Can I keep watching?
No, we're leaving.
I found her in the cowshed this morning.
Maybe you care for her better.
- Come on, Benni.
- Nah.
- We're leaving.
- No, stop! Leave me alone!
No! Get off me!
I want to watch TV! No!
Get off, I want to watch TV!
I combed the woods all night
and you're sitting here watching TV.
I'm responsible for you!
They'll put you in the loony bin, got it?
You should've thought of that earlier.
Shut your mouth!
Put your shoes on.
Come on.
Come here.
Know what happens
if you run away on me?
You get in trouble?
Enormous trouble.
I might lose my job, and...
Let's clean you up,
you smell like a cow's ass.
Come on.
One, two, three.
Ever heard your echo?
Nope.
Try it.
Mama hates me.
- No, your mama loves you.
- Be quiet.
Hey, Benni.
Wake up.
We're there.
Hey, Mighty Mouse.
Come on.
No, I don't want to stay here!
No, I want to go home with you!
- Easy.
- I want to stay with you!
- Just for one night!
- You know this place.
- They're good to you.
- Just one night!
- That's not possible.
- Why not?
- Why not?
- Stop now.
- Why?
- We're getting out and grabbing the bags.
Benni, hey, stop! Stop!
Quit it!
Benni, just...
stop it!
I don't want to go there!
Stop it.
I'll bring you back here
early tomorrow morning.
And you won't make such a scene, OK?
I promise.
I swear.
Unbelievable.
Thanks.
Look here.
Here?
No.
Here?
No.
- Then here?
- No.
- Or over there?
- No.
- There?
- Not there, either.
Here?
Is it this one?
- Is it this one?
- Benni, this is an absolute exception.
- I swear on it.
- I'll take your word for it.
Get out.
Hello there.
This is Benni.
This is Elli and Aaron.
Benni's sleeping over.
It was late, so I thought...
You're having another baby.
- Does it ever kick?
- All the time.
Come here, little guy.
Go to Papa.
What happened to your forehead?
No big deal.
Want hot chocolate?
Come on.
That was the best hot chocolate
I ever drank.
Do you also eat tons of fish sticks?
No, why?
Well, when Mama was pregnant,
she ate tons of fish sticks.
I'd bring them over to her
on the sofa.
How sweet of you.
Then we made armbands together.
That was when
she had broken up with Andi.
Though he was cool,
because I could play on his PlayStation.
Why don't you have a mirror?
We just moved in.
Up a bit.
Press it down.
Ow, it burns.
It's your own fault.
Look here.
Here.
Want your pacifier?
Aaron, pacifier?
Sorry,
I don't know what came over me.
What's up with her face?
I'll tell you later.
Last one is a rotten egg!
On the right.
Micha, why are you having
two children so fast?
The second wasn't planned so early.
Why not use better contraception?
Over and out now, Mighty Mouse.
I'm taking you back tomorrow morning.
No, don't go.
Stay here, Micha.
- Benni, it's already late.
- Don't go.
- Come on.
- No, no.
Micha?
Want to be my papa?
That's not possible.
Why not?
You could adopt me and I'll live here.
I already have a family, Benni.
And so do you.
I'll get Mrs. Bafané to find you
a place with someone always on your side.
And we see each other
when I bring you to school.
What if I kill your wife and child?
I'd have you all for myself.
- Stop talking this crap. Stop.
- No, Papa.
- Please, Papa.
- Stop.
- No, Papa.
- Benni, enough.
Please, Papa, Papa, Papa...
So Benni, how was it in the woods?
Forgot how to walk.
- I'll teach her again.
- Thanks.
Look, you have a visitor.
Don't stare, you cunt!
Benni, try to be friendly.
- No!
- Benni, come on.
- Fuck you!
- Enough.
That vacation sure helped.
You should do it again.
No!
We had an agreement.
- When do we eat?
- In just a moment.
Want dessert?
- Yes.
- I'm hungry.
- Eat up, girl.
- Enough now, kids.
Just a minute.
Watch.
Sit back down. Please sit down, Benni.
Benni, please sit back down.
Benni, please.
Enough.
My dragon got his own chair.
And we built a big swing.
With a tire. The whole time I...
It tasted great and was so cool.
- And we pushed trees over.
- What?
We pushed rotten trees over like this.
And they fell down.
It was cool because
normally you can't push trees over.
- We just did this...
- Look.
You remember this?
Hello Sylvia, it's Benni.
This is Justin. He lives with me now.
Just like you used to.
- Say hello, Justin.
- Hello.
Your coat.
Goodness, how big you've gotten!
- Is Captain Hook still here?
- But of course.
Look, you see him? That's my fish.
The one that's...
Yeah, him. He's pretty.
- With the spots?
- The chubby fish, yeah.
That's Captain Hook, right?
Yes, my Captain Hook.
I like the black and yellow one there.
He's called Kevin.
Benni,
it could be possible for you
to live with Mrs. Schwarz again.
Paul and Emma have moved out.
They're studying.
So I have space.
You could even have Emma's old room.
But there's one thing:
Justin is living here now, so it will only work
if you two get along.
You know, we thought we'd try this:
The three of you can meet up
once or twice a week,
do something together...
- Ice skating!
- I knew it.
Can Micha join us?
- Sure.
- Yeah!
- Can I get some toast?
- You know where everything is.
Come on!
Shoes off!
- How are you?
- Well, and you? - Fine.
And left.
Left.
Left-right.
Mr. Heller, tell me about
any follow-up measures you might have.
All the chips are on our side.
Benni will likely move in
with Mrs. Schwarz.
Mrs. Bafané...
I'm considering
giving her case back.
I didn't think this could happen,
- but I'm losing my professional distance.
- Are you serious?
I let her stay over at my home.
Dammit.
Well...
You aren't the only one
that's happened to.
And now Mrs. Schwarz is onboard...
I have rescue fantasies.
It's out of control.
I'm sorry.
I'll respect your decision,
whatever it might be, but...
at the moment I still need you.
Of course.
Good.
You just have to keep your balance.
You're such a wimp.
I don't like it.
- You do like it.
- No, I keep falling down.
You didn't even try.
Alicia's buggy!
My girl.
Darling, how heavy you've become.
Look, I brought you something.
Look, darling.
Since I couldn't make it last time.
- How lovely.
- Leo, please.
I made it for you with Alicia.
Leo, please stop that.
- Shall we try it on?
- Thanks, Alicia.
- I have a surprise for you, too.
- I'm hungry. I need to eat.
Mrs. Klaas?
This is Mr. Heller, Benni's school escort.
Hello.
Hey, not so wild.
Mama, look. For you!
- Do you like it?
- Lovely, yes.
Nice, huh?
I saved up to buy it for you.
I have to go. Bye.
- Bye.
- See you Tuesday, Benni.
What a surprise.
And here it glitters...
Terrific. Incredible.
- Do you like it?
- I have to eat!
- I'm hungry, too...
- One moment...
Right now would be OK.
How long can we stay out?
Come back in an hour.
- Come on, you rascals.
- I'm coming!
French fries!
Thanks, darling.
Enjoy.
Here you go.
Bon appétit.
Benni, I have something to tell you.
I have a surprise for you.
It's important.
It's over with Jens.
Once and for all.
I just have to find a job and then...
- you can live with us again, little lady.
- Really?
I've already called Mrs. Bafané.
The farmer
has 120 cows.
Almost all of them produce milk
that people drink.
He has milking machines
that are attached to the udders
of the cows.
I've had it with this.
The beginning was great.
I'm really enjoying listening to you.
Helena's listening to you. Yael is, too.
Micha's listening, too.
You're doing just great.
...are taken away
so the mama-cows can be milked.
The farmer sows
- wheat and corn on the fields...
- Be quiet!
...which he turns into food...
for the animals.
Nowadays you can make
plastic bags from corn,
which you can then buy
at the supermarket.
Fantastic!
- Watch where you're going.
- What a girl!
You had a close shave there.
One's own mother is always best.
Though I'd love to have her again.
Now that I have more time.
I just lost my heart to the girl.
Great!
Look here!
No, mailbox.
- Mama will be here any moment.
- Fine, let's begin without Mrs. Klaas. Benni...
Today we're discussing
you moving back in with your mother.
Sorry.
The bus was late and my battery is empty.
Hello, Mrs. Klaas.
We can all start now.
I appreciate the fact
that you want to take Benni back in.
We want to determine
how this will happen.
I'm afraid it's not yet possible.
I...
I don't have any work yet...
It might take a while...
It'd be better in one to two years.
- You promised!
- I know, darling.
You said I could move back!
It was your surprise!
- Darling...
- You promised!
- I know.
- You said it!
- We'll get around to it...
- You promised!
- But not right now.
- You said it!
We need a new apartment.
- You clearly told me as soon as possible.
- I know.
You said I could move home!
I just don't feel...
Alicia is sick and I'm all alone.
Hand out of your mouth.
Take it out!
I'm sorry.
- How are things at home, Mrs. Klaas?
- You don't understand, Mrs. Bafané.
Benni's been a problem child
since kindergarten.
I have two other children
who follow her lead.
Leo's already got problems.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Benni's made such progress
in recent months.
You can't even find a group home
that will take her.
If pros can't deal with her,
how am I supposed to?
You're her mother.
And your behavior has
a huge impact on Benni, Mrs. Klaas.
Sometimes I'm really afraid of her.
I can't do it anymore.
She can never come back to us
or Leo will turn out like her.
Really.
You should at least tell her that yourself.
She's been counting on it, Mrs. Klaas.
- No, I can't.
- You can.
- You have to do it for me, Mrs. Bafané, please.
- No.
Please tell her. I have to...
Mrs. Klaas, please.
- Give her my regards.
- Your regards, Mrs. Klaas!
Are you serious?
Please stay here.
At least say goodbye to your daughter!
Dammit.
Dammit, dammit.
Can I go live with Mama?
Not right now, you know...
I don't think your mother is
quite ready, but...
But...
it'll work out.
Really.
You know,
I think, sorry, I'm a bit...
I think your mom is afraid...
Why?
Sorry.
Why are you crying, Mrs. Bafané?
Sorry, Benni.
Don't cry, it's OK.
It'll pass.
Don't cry.
- Sorry, I'll be fine in a moment.
- Don't be sad.
I'm sorry, Benni.
Don't cry, Mrs. Bafané.
Look at the fat girl.
She can't even ice skate.
Benni, stop. That's mean.
No, it's true.
No.
If I live with you,
can we go ice skating every day?
Sure. Every day is a bit tricky,
but once a week we can do.
Can't you eat your ice cream quicker?
Stop the nonsense.
Watch out, you asshole!
Benni, that's enough.
Ice cream! Here.
- Enough. Benni, we're leaving.
- How come, I didn't even...
No, Benni!
Stop it, Benni!
Stop it! Stop!
Wake up, sleepyhead.
Siesta is over.
And your guests are already here.
I'll be back in five minutes.
Wake up in the meantime.
See you.
Birthday girl!
Look.
A present from your mom.
- Can I open it?
- Of course.
She can't come today, she's sick.
But she says she'll visit you
as soon as she's better.
My own cell!
You know what?
Justin is out of hospital.
And back at home.
I think he's better now.
So, little lady,
birthday girl, the cake's waiting.
And your guests, too.
Today it doesn't matter
if there's thunder, rain or snow
'Cause you're a sunbeam
that always glows
It's your birthday
and we wanna enjoy it, too
All your friends are just so happy
to be with you
All your friends are just so happy
to be with you
How glad we are that you were born
Blow them out!
I declare this buffet open.
Has Elli had her child?
Yes.
- And its name is?
- Julie.
- What a nice name.
- You think so?
This is no permanent placing,
Mrs. Bafané.
Mrs. Bafané?
Sorry.
Benni is getting too emotionally
attached here.
It's a problem,
so we'll have to release her.
Already?
Another break
would retraumatize her unnecessarily.
Can't you make an exception?
Ole was in time-out three times.
I was only there once.
And there are reward pebbles.
If you get 20,
you can watch TV or play Nintendo,
and for 15 you can play
in the common room.
What do you get
the reward pebbles for?
If we follow the rules,
brush our teeth properly,
eat properly, don't use rude words,
and so on.
What rude words?
Asshole. Pussy hole.
Dickhead.
Son of a bitch.
Fuck you.
But that's easy as piss.
Closed facilities are only
for kids over twelve, I've tried them.
What about the intensive program abroad?
We've had good results
with system crashers there.
She can finish school there.
And sometimes they take younger children.
- Where is Kenya?
- In Africa.
But I don't want to go to Africa.
I know lots of children
- who really liked it there.
- But I wouldn't.
It's an adventure,
being on a farm there.
You can think about it.
Fantastic.
Till 6:30.
Oh no.
Someone pissed themselves again.
I'll call you back.
Cool, talk then.
You've got to be kidding me.
Are you nuts, Benni?
She was lying on the ground outside.
She was frozen.
They'll look for you here.
Can I stay for one night?
- Like last time.
- And what then?
Easy. What then, Benni?
You can't just turn up here.
Enough, Micha!
- I'll fix you a bath.
- Elli!
It was your birthday, right?
My late congratulations.
Thanks.
Elli.
Come here.
What were you thinking?
I have money. I can give it to you.
You keep digging yourself deeper.
You sound like the rest.
The more you run away,
the more they'll lock you up.
The older you are,
the shittier the measures will be.
You should get that by now.
Let her stay the night.
Have you gone crazy, too?
It won't make a difference
if we say she came to us tonight.
- And you're responsible for her being here.
- I know.
You'll find a way
to stop her from showing up here.
Finished!
Wow, great.
Heller here.
No.
No idea.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
Bye.
And six.
There you are, sir.
- Do you want six, too?
- Please.
One, two, three...
four...
Careful!
- Got it.
- Bon appétit.
Ping pong peel
Enjoy your meal
Eat everything you can
Except, the next man
If you do eat him 'cause he's sweet
Don't forget to brush your teeth
Michael Heller here, good evening.
Benni has turned up.
No, tomorrow would be better.
Hey, big guy.
You're up so early.
180.
No, don't. Don't knock it over.
One spoon.
Two spoons.
Three spoons.
Four and five.
It's tasty. Really tasty.
Look at this. Look at it.
Morning. You're both up early.
Good morning.
- Will you pass Aaron to me?
- Why? He's happy with me.
You can't just take him.
You worried me.
I just wanted you to sleep in.
That's sweet of you, Benni.
But pass him to me, please.
No. Why?
He wants to stay with me.
- Please give him here, Benni.
- No!
Leave me be.
- Benni, please give him to me.
- No.
- But he's crying. Give him to me.
- No!
Get lost! Get lost, you shitty old cow!
- Fuck you!
- Give him to me.
No!
He wants to be with me.
- Please give him to me.
- No!
- But he's crying!
- He doesn't want to be with you!
Leave me alone!
I hate you all!
Micha, Benni is in there with Aaron.
- Fuck you!
- Open the door, Benni!
- Open the door!
- Get lost!
- He wants to stay with me!
- Open the door! Benni, open the door!
Mighty Mouse, listen.
We'll all go downstairs for breakfast
- and it never happened, OK?
- No!
Open the door!
- Get lost!
- I'm kicking the door in!
- Leave me alone!
- Get away from the door!
Benni, stay here!
Stay put!
Stay put.
Fuck you!
My little lady.
Fine.
Take good care of her.
- And of yourself, too.
- Sure thing.
- Come on, little girl.
- I'm not little.
Then "big girl."
Bye.
Put your bag on the belt, please.
And your hat.
The dragon, too.
- But he's afraid.
- No worries, you'll get him back.
Wait, you can't just walk through.
I have to check you.
Arms up, have you ever flown before?
Wait up!
