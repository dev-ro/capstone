Red Hare! I'm still sleeping!
Enough
Red Hare!
I'm up... I'm up
Hey, that's too
much, no laughing
BEWARE OF HORSE
Get to work! Come
on, get to work!
Tasty
One, two, three, cheese
- Here you go - Boss
look at all the
customers, extra 50?
Then I can go for another horse
Not bad, and you look good too
The guy with the
horse do you know him?
That's Master Luo Zhilong
All you see is a fool and
his horse in the film studio
But back then in Hong Kong
he was probably the best
stuntman you could
find in the business
Master Luo was one of the greats
Follow me
So how have you been?
Dami, hi!
Where did you appear from?
I have not seen you around
Dami, you're funny guy
I've been drowning in jobs
Come on, have a glass
Bravo!
Come on, you're only an extra
and you're drowning in gigs?
How's the situation
with your courtyard?
I just can't sell it
No one's buying? Foreclosure
You get it now, do you?
Let me borrow your
horse for two days
Dami, that's not funny
If I do that how
can I pay you back?
Does it look like I'm joking?
Today, your horse is
coming as collateral
No... please don't
take Red Hare away
- Take that horse away -
No, Dami, I'm begging you
Get him
I bet that hurts
Hey, get off my horse
Help me!
I warned you, didn't I?
Red Hare, go!
Go!
- A horse!
- Sorry... sorry
This hotel doesn't allow pets
Go
Careful!
Who are you?
You are a crazy man
Everyone, please carry on
I can't get through
There must be a better way
Come on
- Stop! Stop -
Where did he go?
Stop... where are you going?
So smart!
Red Hare, come on
Where did the old guy go?
- Master Luo - You
stayed the night again?
- It's not like you ever sleep
here - Fighting with your wife?
My wife doesn't fight, she kills
Master, that idiot's upstairs?
You tell him to wear his pajamas
Dead man!
Are you Mr. Luo or Master Luo?
Yeah, what is it?
Hello, Mr. Luo
We're here about your horse, sir
I believe three years
ago you got this horse
from Mr. Wang of LM
Recently LM's lawsuit with DY
Capital which has been ongoing
has been resolved so as
of this moment DY Capital
has the right to secure any and
all of LM's property for auction
Including your horse
Look here
Go! It's my horse! If you don't
leave right now he's gonna bite you
- Master, what's wrong?
- They're trying to auction Red Hare
- You wanna die?
- You gonna hit us then?
This is ridiculous
You're crazy
Go and put some clothes on
Take a look
And wait for it to be enforeced
Fools
I'm still confused
My friend's company
is bankrupted
Red Hare's mom belonged
to that company
Ask Boss Wang to explain it to
you and it will be over with
He died a year ago
If it's that easy,
why'd they come?
Stop that rocking!
So annoying!
Master, maybe you
need a good lawyer
Oh, yeah
How can I pay for a lawyer?
The creditor's family has
hereby applied to the court
for enforcement of the judgment
Golden Garden properties which
belong solely to our client
will be auctioned by the
court to repay Li's debt
In matters pertaining
to this auction
I hereby submit an objection to this court in
order to protect our client's property rights
and halt the enforcement
of this auction
He's still here
How have you been?
Why did you come here today?
I... I...
I ran into some trouble
I may need your help
I need to find a lawyer
- You broke the law?
- No, it's not what you're thinking
It's Red Hare, my horse
someone wants to take him
- I need a lawyer to help me - So why
don't you go find a lawyer yourself?
- Didn't I come to find you?
- I'm not a lawyer
I'm a college senior
I can't afford a lawyer
- I have no money - I'm
not here to borrow money
I'm here to ask
if you can help me
Luo Zhilong, I don't want
anything to do with you
Whatever problems you have
please don't contact me
I'm begging you, leave me alone
Daddy, is this 'cause
you don't want me?
- How could daddy not want you?
- But I don't want to go with Mommy
Well done, nice speech
Enough, come on
- It's alright, it's okay, it's okay,
honey - Stop crying! People are watching!
Sing the scales twice
and you'll see daddy
Keep dreaming,
you'll never see her
- You won?
- I won
I'm sorry, a family
matter suddenly came up
I shouldn't have missed
your first solo trial
Actually, I was a bit of a jerk
I'm glad you didn't see it
I said that the father over there was
worthless but I'm the one who broke them up
- Master - David!
Someone recorded the fight? No
one's gonna give me money now
Master Luo
I came here to invite you and Red
Hare there to cameo in my film
But, it's gonna be a real tough
job will Red Hare be okay?
Okay, he's okay I trained
him since he was a baby
- He's my last
disciple - Really?
Red Hare, Red Hare, come
Say hi
Red Hare, it's
all on you, right?
No problem, Red Hare
is the best aren't you?
Kiddo, be good, okay?
Let us practise together
I know Dad has gone
a bit overboard
It's because we finally
get a chance to make it big
Don't hesitate! Don't back down!
A stuntman has to be hot-blooded
Now... jump!
- Waiter, refill!
- Shut up!
You really should
drink less coffee
We need to discuss something
My mother has asked if
she could meet your family
She wants to meet them
Doesn't your mother
know I have no family?
It's just me on
my family register
Why is she suddenly asking now?
You suggested marriage after
graduation so I mentioned it to her
She heard that and... can't wait
Just remind her again
Tell her we're not
quite there yet
- Are we not?
- Not yet
Our relationship doesn't
have to go to Ground Zero
It doesn't, but I can't get a
random man to decide on my marriage
- I appreciate that your parents are
traditional - Thanks for understanding
Maybe we should just end it
Don't cry now, take care!
Love you!
Why do you have to see him?
Bao, would you just do your mom a
big favor? Get along with your father
Come on, just give it a rest
You've been telling me that line
forever Mom, but things never improved
Why do you have to
bring it up again?
There're some things I have to
tell him, this is for your sake
- What things?
- For when you're all grown up
Thing like your
graduation ceremony
And your wedding
You sound like you're not coming
Of course I will
Just you, I don't need him there
All the promises he
made he could never keep
Go! You've no right! Just go!
I didn't know that your...
You waited until she
was gone to show up?
I don't have a dad!
Promise your mom
one thing, okay?
If your father reaches out
to you, don't ignore him
Promise?
I made something special
for you, stand still
You have to do it, okay?
You wanna act?
Photo 15, a ride 50
Want a photo?
Ever seen someone like
me with a spear before?
No, thanks, let's go, let's go
I think, I can
help you, 50 a ride
- What are you doing?
- Horses can't eat that
- Sorry...
- You idiot
Let's go
Hey, come on, time to practice
First, we'll practice
your reactions
In a sec, I'll hit
you in the face
I'll do it gently
But react like it's real
1... 2... 3...
Don't duck, stay still
and let me hit you
We're making a movie where does this
temper come from? Throwing gloves now?
It's a great chance
so we have to practise
PAPERS OF CIVIL JUDGMENT
- It's cleaned - You
don't have to do this
Just tell me about your case
if you need a lawyer, I can...
ask my boyfriend
if he can help you
You've got a boyfriend?
What's his name?
None of your business
His name is Mickey
- What does he do?
- A lawyer?
So you mean he's a Mickey
Mouse lawyer? Reliable?
Heel! Stay!
Hello Red Hare
And my name is Bao
I sure do hope they're
getting along in there
- Sir - Tell me,
why are you nervous?
I am not!
I'm good
Can you fight?
Me fight?
Choose between the ER
and a prison cell?
- Not good - If
you don't fight
How can you protect her?
I can represent her,
does that count?
What is with that face?
Is his case that difficult?
- Are you nervous?
- No
What did you talk about?
You haven't discussed
anything yet?
We're talking about men's stuff
Come on, Mickey, your time is precious
so you guys can't just chit chat
Yes, let's get down to it
Here's the deal! Mr Big
Shot experienced lawyer
Sir, please don't call me...
Big Shot or experienced lawyer
Actually, at university
I was Bao's senior
by three years
I finished my internship one
month ago, just got my license
I'm still just a
freshman at my firm
Why don't you just
call him Mickey?
We're brothers, if you need
more time you can pay me later
- It's 3 millions -
Everyone has hard times
- A newborn?
- Yeah
Luo, Linglong here belongs
to me, you take her
What about him?
He's deformed, crooked
legs, bad lungs
We have to do the humane thing
- So you mean putting it down?
- That's the usual way
You wanna come
with me, get up now
There he is!
It's just the two
of us from now on
what should we name
you, little guy?
It's okay, good boy
Come on, boy! I know, boy
That's it for today
now, let's rest, come on
Come on! Go on! Come!
Come, come over, come! Good
Good, good
Kiddo, you're good?
Stand up, stand up!
Men shouldn't kneel
easily do not kneel!
- What's wrong, Sir?
- You can pet him
I'm okay
So strong
So then, about Red Hare
The truth is, from a legal standpoint
it really doesn't look too good for you
Then I'll have to have
your help, Brother
- Who are you calling your brother?
- I mean Minnie
- Mickey...
- It's fine
Hey, Mickey, you need
to get a bit stronger
- I'll teach you to box
- I'm okay, thank you
A man must learn to fight!
- Next time - My disciple
Red Hare, show your
brother here how it's done!
Brother? Me?
Red Hare's gonna be a stuntman!
Okay then, lesson 101 how
to take a beating, got it?
- I think I'm okay - Next time
Red Hare, come on
You see it? Here
comes a punch, come on
- Why did you move?
- Your papa won't really hit his horse, right?
Hey, Mickey come here, come
You, put on the
gloves and punch him
I can't do that, I could
never... I can't...
- What if he kicks me?
- Red Hare's a pro
- I'm a pro at
living - Just try
Sir, wait, I'm still so young
Bao...
I'm sorry
You're dead
Love you?
Calm down...
Red Hare, keep going! Sit!
Down, roll! Perfect!
- Hey, you see that?
- Sir, is he just faking?
It's called acting
Same thing, I studied the law
this has nothing to do with me
Hey, he likes you a lot,
you see? Red Hare, up!
You see that? What a good boy!
- I know, let's try something
else as well - No...
- Sir, that's enough
for me - Up...
- Calm down, and I'll show you -
I'm afraid he's going to kick me!
- Bao, say something
- Give me a kiss
Come on, give me a kiss
I really do hope you
can make the time
to witness the debut
of a new stuntman
Your dad was the
best in the industry
- Yo!
- Hey, Shrimp!
Easy, don't scare
Luo's daughter!
See? Look!
You just stay here, I've got other
things to do but don't wander around, bye
- Coming - They are here
Hello, Boss He
- Director - Director
He's very talented
You two all good?
No problem, piece of cake
Then, come on!
Go on then
So, are we ready?
Let's go for a take
Red Hare! Let's go,
we're on camera!
- Ready?
- Get set!
And action!
What's wrong? You scare?
What the heck? Who is that?
- Who the hell is that?
- I'm sorry
- Let's try again - Go on!
Red Hare, okay?
Let's be scared after this take
Let's go, 3... 2... 1, action!
Hey, stop
My people are standing by
- I'm so sorry, I'm sorry
- What are you doing?
Can we continue? Why did
you get me an amateur?
Get the out of here,
this guy will do it
- You're just wasting
our time - Go on!
Come on
everybody, take a little break
Master Luo, I'm so sorry
Hey! First positions!
Okay, get set
Everyone get ready
Get set! Ready!
Red Hare, it's okay, buddy
We won't do it if
you don't want to
But if you did want to do it
I know you can get it right
It's fine, we're all with you
Go on
Okay, easy
Stop...
Easy...
- Tell your guy
to move it - Wait
Trust me, okay?
Hey, stop standing
around, come on!
Get ready! Back on
your first positions
No, come on!
Red Hare's gonna do it
- Get back - Let's do this
I think he's gonna come back
Stay!
Go!
Yeah!
Thank you to everyone!
Yes!
- Let's meet him - Sure
- Come on, 3... 2...
1 - I don't know how
Papa will teach you
He is a good boy,
we will protect you
Kiddo, be gentle
Sister's first ride
Come
I'm letting go now
- You okay?
- Yeah
Get that black
horse out, hurry up!
Mr. Luo, film crews are asking
They all want you all set
- Oh, that's great!
- It's amazing, awesome!
You should show me your contract
Contract? I've never
had a contract, no need
You do need one you'll
need it for the lawsuit
- I would not understand
one - I would, I'll help you
Good
Ready, 3, 2, 1...
Go!
No... you can't go... no...
- You alright?
- Yes
Good
The rules
Helping out of love
Not helping is
unreasonable no imposing
No thieving, no
bullying, no borrowing
Sir, what if we
lose the lawsuit?
Come, let's practice
it'll be useful soon
What happened to
"No bullying", sir?
No way! Are you kidding me?
This clause is a must
It's only a horse!
Why set up a tent for an animal?
Doesn't he need a rest
between dangerous stunts?
And for the old man as well
- Come on, he's just a stuntman!
- Sign it
It begins at 4.5
meters drops to 3.4
it's a 2.2 meters pitch
and a 1.1 meter drop
- All sound okay?
- Okay
Then we'll sign it, the
crew is waiting for you
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready
I'm okay
- I'll be more
gentle - I'm fine
Don't you move
Can we sit, get comfortable
to talk it through?
- We can chat here -
I'm here on business
Go on then!
Fine
I visited former employees of LM
but nothing helpful came of it
There's still one key
person I couldn't reach yet
The former owner of Linglong
He's can confirm whether Red Hare
was the personal property of Mr Wang
Who said you could
get up and drink?
- Thirsty - Squat!
- My butt's sore!
- Your butt will thank you later
- Thank you - Hello
I'm president of
Flying Dragon Group
- I'm He Xin - Hi
Please
Please
We've curated 50 horse breeds
from nearly 30 countries
I'm obsessed with collecting
world-class horses
And as you can see, horses
receive the best care under me
Mr Luo, I'd like to talk
to you about your horse
2 million and he
still won't take it
It's not a matter of money
Well, Mr Zhang I'll take
a look at what you sent
- Thank you, bye bye - Boss
LM lost its lawsuit
with DY Capital
Linglong gave birth to Red Hare
He's in the executor's
list of properties
He'll be auctioned off
Interesting
- Well, meet DY Capital - Yes
- Let's work with
them - Got it
We are not accepting any offer
Who's that?
Hey! Don't touch my things
Who let you in?
You don't have a door
- Master Luo, nice
to see you - Get out!
We applied for a
compulsory execution
This is the court's notice
for enforcement for you to see
Master Luo, please cooperate
That's one hungry horse
It's fine, we've
got more, no worries
How do you want us to cooperate?
- This horse here is...
- You've already taken this to a judge
So now we only communicate
through the courts, right?
- Yes, in theory...
- Okay, good then, leave
- Look, kid, who are you?
- His agent
- You have license?
- And how old are you?
That is none of your business!
I did not say that I
am his lawyer, did I?
I'm his agent ad
litem that a problem?
With the compulsory execution order
the process will be straightforward
The two of you don't
need to come again
Tomorrow our lawyers will file
an objection to your order
We've reason to believe
you've been misinformed
This horse is not
your company property
- Anything else?
- And your reason is...
Go ask his lawyer,
we're done now
Red Hare, escort them out
Does he bite?
Bao, you did an
awesome job just now!
You're much better
than I could ever be!
It's just stuff I
learnt in school
Red Hare, isn't
your sister cool?
What's a "ruling of dismissal"?
The court disagrees with us
- It won't suspend
the order - What then?
File an objection on the grounds that
the court's decision was in error
Good, what's that mean?
- They can't take Red
Hare - Good! I like it
It's stated in the contract
You must provide air
conditioning so turn it on now
It's cool enough in here
we've got iced water
Sure you feel cool in
shorts and a t-shirt
But he's wearing a thick costume
- Hey - But I...
That's enough, come see this
Careful
There is no run-up
And there, can you see that?
Not enough room to stop
But Luo, I think it's enough
room here you can just try it
Why don't you try?
Listen to me, the run-up
should be at least 30 meters
30 meters?
- Really? Are you certain?
- No way, it's just too tight
Why didn't you say so before?
Everything's ready
and you say you can't
Come on, you know how much
I spent on this set for us?
Come, let's talk about it
Look at your contract
Will you compensate
us if you don't jump?
- Well, that's your problem
- What's our problem?
We don't have any problems here!
Listen, if you don't jump...
set-up fee, location fee
labor costs, the director
1st AD and 2nd
AD... and 2nd AD...
Little girl, who do
you think you are?!
Stop cosplaying as a film
producer at my expense
Air conditioning? Be
thankful you have air!
Hey! You talk to my
daughter that way again
- and you are dead - Look, Luo
Your baby girl is the one who
asked me to build this set for you
It took us all more
than a month to do this
If you don't do this stunt, no need to
kill me because my boss will do it first!
- I'll do it - No way!
- Stop messing around and
wasting time - Don't touch her!
- Get back in place
- You'll jump, right?
I will
Good... going... and I'm gone
Quiet on set!
- Roll camera!
- No, dad, you can't do the jump!
Bao
There's a rule in our family
When you sign a contract
you papa will honor it
Wait a sec, since when
did we have this rule?
Today
Okay...
Do it for Bao
Okay, Red Hare
Get ready, we're rolling!
Quiet on set, action!
Red Hare!
We did it!
I'm sorry
Yo, Bao!
You guys going for dinner? Everyone
heard about it, come on, bro
Hey, this one suits you
dude, come on, try it on
Did you know? A
stuntman's reputation
is forged in great action scenes
What Red Hare and I pulled
off today wow, big deal!
We should go celebrate
Such dangerous stunts
shouldn't be celebrated!
But we have to celebrate it, besides
who knows what tomorrow will be?
Ridiculous
You see? I tell you
you look like a K-pop
idol in that wig, mate
Ladies are gonna dig it, right?
Hey, customer, just
get a feel of it
- Hey there, Shrimp
- It's Jie, right?
Go on, have a look around, dude
Do you have Yuan
Wei's autograph?
Who cares about Yuan
Wei? What about Ying?
The best stuntwoman, yeah?
The scenes you're doing right now
are for stuntmen in their prime
Aren't you too old
for big stunts now?
Other than stunts I
don't know anything
You're old, Master Luo
Am I really getting that old?
What a heartwarming
topic it's so moving
Hey, baby
Master Luo's, still
got the moves!
Dami, watch your mouth
she's my daughter
How sweet!
- Somebody paid their debts?
- We'll talk later, we're having dinner
You have a debt to me if you
don't pay me back right now
I'll spend time with this one
Go, are you okay?
Get him!
Careful!
You stay away from her!
You okay?
In the old days,
stars used spittoons
Not many people use
them now so it's vintage
Hey Jie, watch the shop
You stay here watch the shop
Don't worry, I'm here
- Fine, hold on
to me - Move...
Hit a disabled man? I have
steel plates all over!
Hit me! Here!
The Police! The police are
here! You gonna hit me? Go
Red Hare, come on
Bao!
- Forget him, come
on, Bao - I'm sorry
Give me your hand
- You guys should go!
- Quick! Go
Come on!
Stop the horse! Stop
Sir, we'll be going now
- Bye bye - Hey, Bao
Can you visit us more often?
If you don't always
fight, I'll come
He started the fight!
Red Hare was great
in the fight today
Today I got to feel what it's
like to be protected by you
We need protection too
You got old before you grew up
How could I leave
you now? See you
Go on home
What's wrong?
My dad said, he needs protection
Kind of weird
You and your dad don't
act like strangers
He and I were never close
I wasn't even a year
old when they divorced
I rarely even saw him as a kid
Okay, don't cry, good girl
I have to work, I
could be a night shift
I can't, people
are waiting on me
You only care about
your work, so just go
Hey, Bao come here,
let papa hold you
- Mommy, who is that?
- That's your papa
Hey, come on, here,
hey, it's okay
- He's good - Yeah
Red Hare!
Red Hare! Baby, you alright?
You hurt? No?
Daddy's so proud!
Good... good, good
Ready? Quiet on set!
3, 2, 1
You okay, Red Hare? You hurt?
You're amazing, come!
What happened? Why does
Red Hare have wounds?
Can you not make him do
such dangerous stunts?
Those wounds are nothing
You're too reckless on set
Reckless? You're an outsider
That's just how
stuntmen do things
Stuntmen! But Red
Hare isn't a stuntman!
He is one, he has
the spirit of one
- You kids know nothing - Your
generation's time has passed!
Our brothers have got this
Draw! Shoot! Here's
the blast point
We must be precise
in our positioning
Ready? 3, 2...
- Move it!
- You're early!
- Put it out!
- Call an ambulance
- Put it out -
Call an ambulance
Take her home,
let her get rested
The doctor said she
might never stand again
I taught her, I
know she will stand
I've never been so
scared in my life
Should have made her
give up this line of work
A stuntman knows the risk
What kind of people are my
father and his brothers?
They're very simple,
action! Jump!
Hospital!
However bad it looks
now just stay calm
- Your body needs
to heal - It's fine
I'm just happy for my master
Hey! Well?
I'm dying
This one? This one's okay?
The police are outside
- Hey, this one better?
- That one's not bad, take the shirt away
Take the shirt off? I can't
Is this good?
Master Luo, if you don't mind
it no one else will mind it
- Hello - Hey, hey
Sir, my parents
- Hello - Nice to meet you
I'm Donald, this
is my wife Daisy
- Hello - Great, I'm Luo!
Sit, sit...
Hey, pour the water!
Mickey's parents are
named Donald and Daisy?
- His dad looks very old -
You think you're so young?
Hey, menu!
- Drink up!
- Yeah!
Alaskan king crab, 15 pounds
- Sir, we don't serve
that - You don't?
- How about masked palm civet?
- Pardon?
Masked palm civet
Sorry, sir, we've never
heard of that before
You clearly can't order
I'll do it
On my first date with her
mother, that's what we ate
Then we had her
Mr Luo, what is it that you do?
Me? On set, making movies
- Good - An artist!
No wonder, I do
love watching movies
Yasujiro Ozu, Andrei Tarkovsky
- India's Abbas - Iran's, dad
- I truly adore all their work
- We should share our favorites
- Yes, indeed - So Mr Luo
tell me what exactly is it that
you do in the film industry?
Oh me? Jump buildings
smash glass, fall into fire
hang onto buses using an
umbrella and fly on wires
- Here, have more
- Yes, thank you
We can't waste it, eat more!
No, I can't eat anymore
Then I'll eat the abalone
- You don't want it?
- No
Dad, what's wrong with you
today? Why in such a hurry?
Sorry, lemme tell
you, you don't know
On the first date with your
mother how much I upset her
- How was I born if she was so upset?
- I charmed her!
Daughters are
usually daddy's girls
I can tell the two of you seem
to be very close to each other
Actually, the two of us hadn't
seen each other for six years
In fact, we just got to
know each other recently
Since you wanted
to meet my family
this is the best
I have to show you
I understand that you might have
been expecting something better
But in the end, he's my father
And I knew before I came here tonight that
he might not make a good impression on you
He doesn't know how to
pretend to be normal, he can't
But my father is
simple, and sincere
After getting to know him
that's what I am most proud of
I'm not going to let my
father dictate my future
But I want to give him a real
chance to try and be a real papa
I know, that marriage is
a union of two families
I'm not classy
But I hope you won't reject Bao
just because she has a dad like me
I'm not qualified to be her dad
But since my daughter
has given me the chance
I will try
Bye, uncle, auntie
- Nice to meet you - See you!
- Goodbye - Goodbye, sir
That went well
How do you plan to "try"?
How do you want me to try?
I really hope you change how you train
Red Hare, don't push him so hard every day
Red Hare is my horse how
I train him is my business
Maybe you should stay out of it
Tell me, was it fun to
play at being a parent?
You really messed
up, you know that?
You only care about yourself
You're selfish, you're
rude and you're impolite
In fact you're more
immature than a young child
I could have accepted all this
but now I really regret it!
Even children know
how to reciprocate
I put aside my pride but
you can't be less stubborn!
I thought you'd understand
You think I care?
If you don't need your
dad don't ask me to come
So did you hear that, mom?
This man won't ever change
Master, Master Luo!
We're ready
Oh, thank you
Kiddo, am I really in the wrong?
Perhaps, we need to
make some changes
After today, we'll listen to her
Let's go, come
Leg okay? You can do this
Red Hare, your leg
Red Hare, don't force it!
Careful, don't run
over him! Watch out!
Bao, go get an ID for your dad
who knows what
documents we'll need?
ACCIDENT INSURANCE APPLICATION
INSURED PERSON: LUO
BENEFICIARY: BAO
Hey Bao, what grade
are you in now?
Fifth grade
So, what are you
learning? How's your mom?
I bought you a gift
See? So cute! Even
cuter on, see?
Your pa, every time he saw you
he asked for the video footage
He watched it on a
loop when he missed you
I can't count how many times
Every time, he was
always heartbroken
He'd say...
it would've been great
if he'd done better
Perhaps, you wouldn't
hate seeing him
He always said he
couldn't make you happy
Papa
I'm sorry, I didn't
know what you did
Papa was dumb
I was the dumb one
Promise me papa you'll
never leave me again?
I won't
- And no danger -
I'll listen, really
And Red Hare?
No more stunts
for him, I promise
- For real?
- For real
It's your money! Why're you spending
it like this? I have clothes!
Just get rid of your old clothes
- You have room to improve
- I have lots of new clothes
You can't make the same
mistake with the other parents
- Bao?
- Go on
Bao, so... other parents?
Whose parents are they?
Bao
Don't joke about that stuff in
the future, it'll break my heart
My heart breaks when I say it
Who'd have thought he
would clean up so good?
- I have really good
taste - I picked it out
You pick it next time
Hey, slowly, easy! You're throwing
away everything he's been saving?
Okay, good choice
Hey, wait, there's more
this isn't a crime, right?
- Acquisition Law
- Which part of it?
- Article 331 - Article
311, how did you pass?
- This constitutes half
of it - I'm acquiring it
It's a good acquisition
on your part! Go that way!
Hey, guys? Hey!
Where did you go?
TO SHRIMP, PASS TO BAO
WILL BEQUEATHER: LUO
Were you in any pain?
- Dunno - Stop staring at me
- See? This is...
- Papa, you're awesome
I was sent back to Hong
Kong after the surgery
I'm okay
A brain injury
I didn't wake up
for eight months
And I couldn't even speak for a year
I couldn't remember a lot of things
Papa, why didn't you tell me?
I hadn't worked for over a year
Company bankrupt, people left
I was buried in debt
this one, ruined me
I went from the
best to the worst
At the time, I was so depressed
Didn't see anyone,
including your mom
I was afraid, I
really let her down
Then I... forgive
you on mom's behalf
There
Grab it! Hold it tight!
Stop it!
Red Hare!
Don't hurt them! Careful
Red Hare, forget
him! Come help papa!
There're more men here!
Hey, why're you sitting
down? What's wrong with you?
Red Hare! Come fight!
Young man, you barely
have any skills
I'll fight you
Hey, don't fight
Why're you still hitting me?
Red Hare, they're beating your
papa are you just gonna sit there?
- Good! You sit!
- Who do you listen to?!
What are waiting for? Get him!
Round #2?
Go!
Hey, wait!
- Aren't you tired?
- I'm
Okay!
Thank you sir
Wait
Hold on!
I can't
You okay?
- Why didn't you let go?
- You were holding my jacket
Done fighting?
Take care of your boss!
Boss, come on, get up, boss!
Dami
You've got skills
- Why do you do this?
- I gotta eat, right?
Your kungfu's good
You don't have to be a
debt collector forever
My advice? New work!
Be a stuntman? I don't want
to lay there like a corpse!
Back in the day, I was such an amazing
corpse the director discovered me
I'll teach you
Maybe next time
You will be my disciple
No fighting with your brother
speaking of which, here he is
Who's he?
Hey... but your money
- Yuan Wei!
- Master Luo!
What's this?
Brother! Why're you living here?
Company's gone, home's gone
So I packed up my
old stuff, here
It's big enough, I'm on my own
And it's close to work
You haven't changed at all
Same as always taking
care of everyone
Any pains, you dismiss it
I'm okay!
Seeing my friends do
well makes me happy!
Hey, sit...
What brings you here? Speak
Back then, the role
that made me a star
Was for you, right?
Nonsense, they were looking for
a promising new star back then
Look at you, you're a big star
When I arrived in Hong Kong
I couldn't afford a bowl of
noodles you brought me to the set
Back then I was reckless
If you hadn't been
there I would have died
I would never let you die, kiddo
Jumping down is easy
Stepping down is hard
Jumping down is easy
Stepping down is hard
I started as a stuntman
Now I want to find
a way to pay respect
to the true spirit of stuntmen
Let's make a film, my film
Just like the old days
And you can tell me what to do
I'm old, so I can't
my daughter won't
let me do stunts
Don't worry, we've got equipment and
the best technology for your safety
It's not worried
about the safety
Brother, you've
been silent enough
It was always otherfaces
on the big screen
It's about time, to put
your face on the screen now
So, Shrimp knows you're here
he'd like to stock up
Come on, sit, take you time
Kiddo, papa's old
But he still can't let go easily
Audiences today don't
know what we achieved
That's why someone
needs to show them
We's creating a tribute
I admit I'm moved
Kiddo, listen to papa
You're no ordinary horse
You can be somebody
You just need the chance
Your talent
shouldn't stay hidden
Don't worry, I'll
help you do this
Practice! Come on
He's here, papa we
found the evidence!
- Hey, coming!
- They can't take Red Hare anymore
We got in touch with
Linglong's old owner
He said Linglong was
personally owned by Wang
Red Hare was never
the company's?
- It's conclusive!
- Yeah
- Thank you Mickey!
- Thanks for you all
No, Big Shot!
You're welcome
Thank you, Bao! Thank you
What's going on here?
Hey, listen to me, Bao
You know the famous
star Yuan Wei?
He approached me
to perform stunts
I have to do it
What do you mean "have to"?
You... you kids won't get it
It's you who don't get it
you want to hurt Red Hare?
And what for?
Dignity? Your pride?
Your so-called spirit
of the stuntman?
Real stuntmen
Stuntmen don't break promises
to their children either
Bao, Bao
3, 2, 1, go!
Move it
Brother!
Brother, director
Long time no see, Master Luo
- Wei always talks
about you - Harness
- Bring me a vest - Master Luo
Take a look, at the
digital action preview here
Amazing
so we watch cartoons
before the shoot?
Yeah, it's different
from the old days
The PreViz preview is for the
CGI composite in post-production
- What I?
- Computer generated imagery
- Effects - Effects
They're doing test runs
so you guys won't fall
Hey, harness the horse
and here's one for you
No way, do it for real
How do we do that?
Red Hare and I
will fall, for real
- For what?
- Wait, are you kidding me?
But no one falls
for real these days
If not, what're people watching?
Move it
We use technology
now why risk it?!
- You don't think I can do it?
- Brother, you're mistaken
Hey, Master Luo don't
be so stubborn, okay?
Director, I won't take
up your time, sorry
- Hey! Brother!
- Sorry
- I'm sorry, let me talk
to him, thank you - Sorry
Sorry about that
There are many different
ways to make a film now
The spirit of the stuntman
is dying cause of this
- Brother, just listen to me...
- Don't say anything
We do it my way or
else, not at all
- Brother - One
more word, I'll quit
Fine, then quit!
I want to honor your life's
work not film your death
Wei, if I use all this stuff
I'd regret it forever
You want a true tribute, right?
Well then, honor how
it was done in the past
Do it for real
I'll go prepared
On my count 1, 2,
3! Go to the general
Kiddo, papa can't give you much
But if you pull it off
your life will
change, you can do it
Ready, roll camera!
And action
For our country's sake
I'm begging you, Emperor
Don't break your commitment
give everyone a chance
It's my last stunt today
My final victory
He's really not a stuntman
He's just a child who wants
to make his papa happy
He can feel pain, you know?
I'll help you to
do this, practice
What're you doing? Stay
Don't be like this!
Hold your temper!
You can't use him like a
tool to achieve your goals!
Is he okay? What happened?
I'm okay...
Back to positions
Back to first
Hey, hurry
Kiddo, daddy's sorry
Maybe, we don't do this
Okay, we don't do it
- Hey, Wei - He's here
- You okay?
- I'm sorry
I can't do this stunt
I'm sorry
It's fine, it really is
That's great
Never thought I'd
turn down a stunt
Shameful
Jumping down is easy
stepping down is hard
That's what you taught me
I shouldn't have made
Red Hare try that stunt
I've been jumping
down my whole life
When I stepped down
for the first time
I understood
the true spirit of the
stuntman hasn't changed
Brothers, family need protection
Director Tong, I was
foolish, I'm sorry
I truly admire your bravery and
persistence, thank you very much
Brother, thank you for
giving me this chance
In any case, I'm done
- What about...
- Just forget it
I'm just a stunt double
But don't get a
cartoon to double me
Come, we're going home, Red Hare
Thank you, brothers!
Thank you...
My sweet girl
Papa has learned
how to step down
I know I've kept you
waiting for so long
I'm sorry
Go home?
This document is the written
witness statement of Xie
the former owner of Linglong
It's very clear
Linglong was bought for $980,000 by
Mr Wang in a personal transaction
However, due to a personal
cash flower problem at the time
Mr Wang did use the
corporate bank account of LM
to advance the payment
But you can see three days
later on the 16th of March 2015
the same amount was repaid in full
from Mr Wang's personal bank account
to the corporate
bank account of LM
Even if these statements are correct
the corporate account was used
But Mr Wang never reimbursed
the company the interest
As noted in the company's
financial accounts
the purpose of the
money repaid by Mr Wang
related to a different horse
named Hurricane, not for Linglong
We have Mr Wang's signature
Is that true?
It was written wrong
Plaintiff's family will be quiet
This is witness testimony
from the accountant
To establish the
context of the entry
I think you must have forged it!
Just be quiet, Bao!
The defense will
continue their case
We can't just give up!
We just can't! No!
Papa
It's my fault, for losing him
- All good?
- Thank you
Acquisition! Bona
fide acquisition!
It's Article 311 purchaser
acted in good faith
the price was sound,
delivery was made
He took ownership!
Master Luo and Red Hare
met the three conditions,
so it's qualifies!
But you've already
lost, it's over
Mr He, wait,
Mr. He, listen to me
Yes, we lost, but you can't
watch a family be torn apart
I've always believed the
saying "The law must..."
"balance justice and empathy"
Red Hare was born
with a disability
it was Master Luo who saved
him from being euthanized
He saved him
Red Hare might be just
a horse to you or a pet
But to Luo he's
family, it's his child
And I know you can feel Master
Luo's love for Red Hare, right?
Be assured, we will take
good care of Red Hare
better than Master Luo
could he will get stronger
- We will also...
- Listen to me
We won't put Red
Hare in any danger
I love horses more than
Master Luo I know more
Red Hare will be
better off with me
Mr He... please listen to me
- He cannot live without Red Hare!
- Sorry
Why can't I seem to help people
who need it most?
But you did a really good job
- Sir - Come on, we lost
We have to face it
We aren't owed a win, no
matter what we stand tall
I'm sorry, sir, I was too naive
Come on, you did great kid
Thank you
BEWARE OF HORSE
Kiddo, I'm afraid this is it
Soon, papa won't be
around to take care of you
Come here
Remember what I said
You're the best
You'll be someone,
keep your head up
It's fine
Red Hare
Why?
You want to practice?
Okay
Dummy, you should dodge
When someone bullies you
you must dodge
Do it again
Drama queen
Your future owner
won't flatter like I do
Be a good kid, understand?
You're a grown up
You need to learn how
to protect yourself
No matter what you face
you have to be strong
And don't forget about papa
I'm sorry
It's papa's fault,
I didn't protect you
Red Hare, be good
We're here, detach it
Red Hare, here
It's fine
Behave now
He's naughty,
please don't hit him
He has bad lungs,
he gets cold easily
Thank you
- Let's go!
- Sir
Go!
Red Hare, it's okay
Let's go
Let him go
Red Hare!
Stop here!
Who told you to follow?
Go back!
Go back!
Go back!
Just go! Go on!
I don't want you!
Go
Let me reintroduce
myself I'm Mickey Lu
Due to the rules of my
profession I cannot represent you
But, I still want to help you
BEWARE OF HORSE
BEWARE OF NO HORSE
My father's dumb
He expresses his love by
fighting with all his heart
The same for his industry, and to
me and even more so to Red Hare
Nothing can compare
to the love he gives
He's lost half his life already
by giving it to his work
Can't you at least give him
back the other half of his life?
Lemme sleep longer
Red Hare?
Red Hare!
Is that you? Red Hare!
I've missed you so much!
How did you get here?
Did you run back?
How did you come back?
You promise never to leave
again? Never leave again
Your room hasn't changed
You see that? Your
room, your bed
- Just look! You see? My
room's here - Thank you
Even if you hadn't come to me
I'd still have returned
Red Hare in a few days
- But why?
- So I didn't touch it
He was trying to starve himself
Red Hare, Red Hare,
no, stand, that's it
- Don't kneel anymore
- I'm a horse person
But I've never seen such determination to
resist life that Red Hare has displayed
My boy! From now on, no matter
where you go, you bring papa
After you showed me Master Luo's DVD
I understood they are very much alike
They use their own
lives to defend love
Impressive
He's the son of
a kungfu stuntman
Kungfu stuntman?
Impressive
- Papa - Sir
- Kids, thank you both - Sir
Thank you...
Action! Begin!
Camera back into position
Okay
Very okay
Let me tell you
Did you notice I kept moving?
- I didn't - You're
blocking my shot!
A stuntman
has to learn how
to take... take...
- Take...
- Take...
I'm here to talk
about the lawsuit
Let's do it again
One sec, I can't do
it again right away
Sir
Jump buildings
Smash through glass,
Fall into stoves
Fall into kang bed-stove?
Are stoves not the
same as fire pits?
Not the same stoves
as on a cooking range
Okay, let's do it again
I... jump the stove
Jump buildings
Smash through glass,
fall into pits
What're you doing?
Hey! Temper tantrum?
Why'd you have
such a bad temper?
If I don't fall
If I don't fall
If I don't fall
If I don't fall, just don't
Go!
My shot isn't done!
You fought before
I finished my line!
Go back, do it again
Dami, drink up!
He's good
Drink another round,
do another round
Dami, drink up!
He's good
Dami, another round!
Unbelievable, he's good
Dami, another round!
He's coming in
You guys clap when I do this
it's just a regular thing I do
There's a nail
So loud
Taste good?
