"You are in my heart."
"The partner for all my
lives, we stand united."
"The partner of all my
lives, we stand united."
"A sparkle adorns the eyes."
"A pearl adorns the shell."
"The partner of all my
lives, we stand united."
"Like a swan in a group of swans."
"Like the moonlight in the moon."
"Like the imagination of poets."
"Like hope in a heart."
"Like the lamp and it's flame,
we stand together."
"Like mischief filled in eyes."
"Like a ploy playing on the lips."
"Like the heart dances in the rain."
"Like a beloved with her lover."
"Like the lamp and it's flame."
Wake up.
Another dream.
Good God! Praise the Lord!
"The dilicate sons of an
illustrious father."
"They possess separate virtues."
"One is learned, the other
is humble and decile."
"One is intelligent in business."
"One is very religious
and conscious of duty."
"They are all a shadow
of their father."
"One is a devotee of his father,
the other obeys his every word."
"Even in dreams they don't
wish evil for anybody."
Brother and sister-in-law!
Our best wishes for your
25th wedding anniversary!
Thank you, sir.
How is our attorney
without his black coat?
I've taken leave from court.
If I'd have gone to work today.
I don't know what my sister would say!
No public prosecutor
would be able to help me.
See how he is teasing me!
Have a sweet, Ram Kishen.
On this day, he will eat if
his wife feeds him not you.
Sweetmeat made by you. Terrific!
Great! Give some to the kids.
You're the last to
come for the prayers.
And right in front for the sweets!
I was right in time. Ask brother.
Happy anniversary.
- Live long.
He's getting spoilt
because you pamper him!
Mother...
- Have one.
Sir...
- Mr. Khan?
Happy anniversary.
- Thank you so much.
Best wishes from our
office and factory staff.
Mr. Vivek, I've made the list of
the guests for tonight's function.
Are you my secretary or the kids'?
They've been busy with arranging
the function for a whole week.
Frankly speaking, these are the
occasions to share joys with all.
The entire family meets
under this pretext.
Where's that friend of yours, Anwar?
That's how it's so calm. He's gone
to pick up Sangita and Anand babu.
Sounds like Sangita and
our son-in-law are here!
Grandma!
My dear...
Enough... welcome.
Brother!
Anurag and his wife, Jyoti
are not to be seen.
You know my elder brother
has no time for himself.
Doesn't matter. At least
their two children are her.
They have grown so attached
to us that it's amazing.
I feel I have 3 grand children.
Take these...
Just give them one. Their
pockets are full of chocolates.
Before us, who gave them chocolates?
Who else but Anwar spoils them?
You make mistakes and
hold me responsible for it?
What have I done?
You come here just once a year.
Isn't that bad enough?
And look at her cheek!
Where has she gone?
Says, we mustn't spoil the kids.
- I apologize. Sorry.
What do you say?
You are forgiven.
Have some sweets.
Papa, he got it
stitched in his presence.
And this is for you.
This too is his choice.
He's got great selection!
He has knowledge of everything.
You and Mummy have to wear
these in the function.
And what will the children wear?
I'll wear an achkan.
- I'll wear a skirt and scarf.
What about you?
I'll wear a silk achkan
and an embroidered fez cap.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
Don't you have to go to your shop?
Today is a holiday.
- I had a dream last night.
Anwar Band & Co. Is locked up!
Of course. He's here all day.
How does he run his shop?
It's doing very well. Thank you.
Anyway what does man need?
Mother feeds me great food.
And father teaches me
good lessons of life.
Everyone should have one
such friend in their lives.
But my friend still hasn't turned up.
I'm dead tired! Anybody there?
Quickly hide the food!
Hide it.
What's wrong, Pritam uncle.
- Don't ask, son.
It's his 25th anniversary
and I had to make 25 trips!
Hunting for a gift for him!
Where's my gift?
- There he comes to the point!
Just a minute. A pocket
watch for your coat.
And earrings for you!
Matching today's outfits.
- You're very forward!
Did you know what son-in-law
was going to present them!
Is he only your son-in-law?
Does he mean nothing to me?
Look at that veil!
- Aunt dearest...
Caught you! Caught the sweets!
Just one. The doctor's orders.
Forget it! Just because my daughter
has become a doctor, life is tough!
Making me diet forever!
- But where is Preeti?
Must be on her way with Dr. Sen.
Congratulations.
- Thank you, doctor.
Where is Preeti?
- Oh, where is she?
Just you wait!
- Hey, listen...!
These girls are worse than boys!
Childhood friends meet and that's it!
The progress is much
better than I thought.
God willing, we'll get
some movement in his hand.
We have full faith since
we came in touch with you.
Don't be silly.
Homeopathy is effective even
in the most serious ailments.
Even if it's a childhood injury.
It will be effective only when
Vivek takes medication in time.
Anwar posters him so he takes it
else he is so busy with work.
The bottle of pills
is always in my pocket.
Then whether he yells or screams
I pop the pills in his mouth.
Open your mouth
It's time for your dose.
Whether my arm gets better or not...
One thing is for sure, soon we're
going to get a strict but good doctor.
Don't praise her so much
that she starts flying high!
What a tragedy! I started
restaurants in my daughter's name.
How often I've told her to go
there and eat and feed friends.
But no way. I don't know what's
the charm in your profession!
Uncle always talks like
this when he's hungry.
You'll realize when you have to
eat carrots and cucumber all day!
But I won't pay heed
to her in the party.
Prem returns today. I'll
gorge to my heart's content!
I'll meet Prem in the evening.
Our second brother, Prem
returns from America today.
Would you like to express
the depth of your happiness?
Why do you keep
troubling the poor girl?
Don't we know someday these
two hearts are going to be one?
Who has gone to the
airport to pick him up?
Nobody.
- Why?
His instructions are clear. Nobody
need come there, just send the car.
My younger brother doesn't
want to trouble anybody.
He's a real saint.
God knows what will
happen to this boy.
He's one in a million.
Sir has called you to the hall.
The decorators have arrived.
Do you know how Preeti blushes
the moment she hears Prem's name?
Like Anwar blushes at seeing you!
I swear, what a dangerous man!
Once more.
When did you come?
- Just now.
Father and grandma too are here.
- Grandma has come!
Will you let go?
The foreigner returns home.
Finally my eyes are at rest.
Aunt, we really appreciate it that
you came from the village for us.
We had to come. After all
we belong to the same village.
And neighbors at that.
Take charge of the function.
I've brought all the articles
for the stage decoration.
The decoration will be
according to the music.
Because uncle loves music.
Sapna really works very hard.
Always first in college.
She lends you a helping hand at
home and her father at work.
And take a look at my son, Vinod.
He wakes up at 8!
We're beginning the second round.
Has your father finished his prayers?
Whenever I step into this house,
I feel I'm entering a palace!
I have a small sari-making
factory in Rampur.
On the other hand, Ram Kishen
has these great industries!
Lord, let my daughter marry
his younger son, Vinod.
And she inherits one
third of the property!
She will have servants around her!
And she'll live like a queen!
We've bought sweetmeats
from all the famous places.
That's not fair. You always get
so many sweets each time you come!
Just a little. Only for tasting.
That's the spirit!
Excuse me but everybody
in Rampur worships Ram Kishen.
He's done so much for rhe village!
Built colleges and hospitals!
Now he's building a big factory
that will enhance the village.
Vivek too has worked hard on it.
Mother, he is the lamp of the family!
He loves his brother so much!
He trained Prem in business
and sent him abroad.
For further studies. And now...
He's preparing Vinod for business.
So Vinod now helps Vivek?
Helps? He just carries his briefcase.
So what? That's how Prem started.
Isn't that so, Vivek?
Prem does that even today.
Prem has come.
He's here?
Mother...
- Go away.
Mother is annoyed because you
didn't come home in the last vacation.
I'll get her round.
Where there's laughter
on the dining table...
Where the ladies and girls of
the family lovingly feed us...
That truly is a home!
Here's your favorite porridge.
You never fed us with such love.
We only have an aunt.
Here you are, baby.
Take this too. Piping hot samosas.
Serve me one too.
- You too will have?
I prefer the spicy to sweet.
Some more tea?
What about you?
- No.
What? Go on. Serve him.
What a scene!
Better get used to it. She's
going to feed you all your life.
Where are you going? Sit down!
Mumu baby! Where are you?
There they come!
Congratulations, queen mother!
Brother-in-law! Congratulations!
I can understand that you call
your friend Mumu out of love.
But how does he become
your brother-in-law?
The husband of our friend
is our brother-in-law.
You are great!
You've come so late!
Last night we had such
a game of cards in the club...
...that it ended at 4 AM and
you know we can't wake up early.
They wake up late and
stay here till very late!
There are fights in
every family these days!
Fights between brothers, parents,
between mother and daughter-in-law!
I think the moment sons get
married, they should be seperated.
Separate homes, work. That's it.
That's the duty of parents today.
I don't agree.
The joy you can get together
is impossible living alone.
Man can overcome any problem
if his family is united.
Breaking up disperses the energy.
Think of the children.
Why should the grandchildren be
deprived of the love of grandparents?
Absolutely. The duty of parents is...
to inculcate the right
values from childhood.
So they can share each others
joys and sorrows in togetherness.
Would you like to bet on it?
Don't you have to get ready?
My discussion with
Ram Kishen will continue.
Now we have to get dressed.
See you in the evening.
Thank you brother.
Tell the lawyer, see you.
You really have strange friends.
They always talk of breaking
homes never bonding families.
But it is true that the importance
of relationships is lost today.
In such times, your family
and the love you share...
It is an exemplary guiding light.
Mother, his entire life is exemplary!
My sister, Mamta has supported
you ably on this journey.
Isn't it?
- Definitely.
What did I have when
Mamta married me?
Loneliness and a year
old Vivek in my arms.
There's no comparison to the
love Mamta has showered Vivek.
Do you know what gift I
presented to your sister today?
I've given her a promise.
The day I see the faces
of my three daughters-in-law
All my time will be hers.
The moments of joy I couldn't
give her because of my duties,
will all be hers.
When do we hear the wedding
march for Vivek's wedding?
I pray for that day.
We received many proposals
but because of Vivek's arm...
Those matches? Not one
was worthy of Vivek!
Yes, man is recognized by his
heart not his physical being.
And we will find somebody
who will value his golden heart.
Come in, dear.
How are you?
- Fine.
Sadhna, this is Vivek.
Ram Kishen's eldest son.
My daughter, Sadhna.
Welcome.
Mr. Adarsh is very respected
industrialist of our city.
He has just settled here after
established business abroad.
We've come quite close these days
thanks to association meetings.
This far we only met in meetings.
You have honored us by
inviting us for a family function.
My daughter, Sadhna.
Live long.
Nobody can tell that
you grew up abroad.
An Indian is an Indian
wherever he be, isn't it?
This is Prem, the second son.
And this is Vinod, the youngest
and the most mischievous!
What do you think of the decoration?
Beautiful.
- She's done it all.
What color selection!
What flower arrangement!
Ladies love flattery
but only from the heart.
Isn't it, Sadhna?
- That's the problem with ladies!
Either way you're in hot soup.
Raju, Bablu, I'll give you a tip.
You can never win with ladies.
Then why do you fight them?
Hear! Brother, you are an angel!
And you're human. Learn
from commiting mistakes.
You must have one sweet at this.
At least one.
What about your family members?
Only Papa and me.
How nice a family can be
with siblings and parents...
I realize that only today.
Ram Kishen and his wife
have our blessings today.
May they always smile together.
Just a minute. And now
I request Ram Kishen...
He must say something in his
exclusive style for his wife!
I love you very much.
You have to repeat the words you
just said thrice a day all your life!
Now it's your turn.
No...!
- What?
You have to speak. Come here.
I...
I love the children very much!
It's done!
- Come on.
"It is true that God exists."
"He exists but is not visible."
"Our parents are the identification
of the Creator on this earth."
"He gave us birth and his name."
"Holding his hand we
grew from childhood."
"We saw the world
perched on his shoulder."
"From him, we learnt to
differentiate between good and bad."
"How does one account
for all the obligations?"
"It's not easy to describe."
"The one who gives birth
is called mother by all."
"Her life lies in her children."
"Lullabies on her lips,
her eyes spin dreams for us."
"She gives up her sleep for us,
bears every sorrow with a smile."
"God Himself is seen in her form."
"We have been blessed by you."
"Today your dreams have
grown up in our shape."
We pray to the omnipotent Lord."
"May we live under their
shadow till the world exists."
"We can't live without
them for a moment."
"May both of you live forever."
"That is the hope in our hearts."
Why are you so worried?
It is a worrying matter!
What did Adarsh say on the phone?
He's coming here for
some urgent business.
But we met yesterday.
And why does he want
sister-in-law to be present?
You are not aware of business deals.
He will first give you
gifts, flatter you.
Then he'll get Ram Kishen
to do his work.
Why are you getting crazy?
He's a real gentleman.
Mr. Adarsh is here.
Welcome.
He's already here!
Last evening we had the opportunity
to come close to your family.
Frankly speaking, yesterday I saw
how love can make a home a temple.
I come here today with
a desire in my heart.
Honor me by accepting my
daughter's hand for your son Vivek.
I came here with Sadhna
only with this dream.
So that she meets you,
Vivek and the family.
After meeting all of you.
My daughter is no longer mine.
She has changed totally.
Please accept her.
Where are you going?
To get sweets for all.
That's great! Then it's fixed!
What are you thinking of?
I'm amazed at the forms in which
God comes to spread happiness.
We've heard everything.
I'm so elated today!
Why are you thinking of this?
Sadhna and her father
know about your arm.
There's a difference between
knowing and being together for life.
We have no right to
play with somebody's life.
Your arm will be better someday.
Swear by Allah...
- Only on the hope...
We can't snatch somebody's joys.
I don't want to keep her in the dark.
I've written everything to her in
a letter. I hope she understands.
And will marry somebody else.
Listen to him! Sent her a letter!
He talks like a kid!
Talk some sense into him!
You don't know women.
She doesn't fear darkness.
When she makes up her mind...
She lights the lamp of
trust in her heart!
She adorns her hair with it.
Yes brother.
We took your letter there.
And brought the answer back.
"The elder brother
of little brothers."
"Today you will become
somebody's beloved."
"The beating of drums and
blowing of bugles..."
"Happy times have come."
"During Holi we and
our sister-in-law..."
"We'll play with color."
"When Diwali comes by,
we'll light lamps together."
"She'll shield us with her veil."
"She'll be the cool wind."
"The eyes have turned moist."
"The childhood memories
come flooding back."
"On this journey of life,
you will be bonded by love."
"How handsome my elder brother is."
"Like Lord Rama on his
way to wed Mother Sita."
Hello.
- Welcome.
Stretch your hand to accept the bride.
When we were abroad, I'd wonder
with little Sadhna in my lap...
How should I teach her our culture?
But I saw I didn't have
to make any efforts.
Automatically she imbibed
all these qualities.
Today I know why.
She had to bind a cord to your family.
Go, my child. To your house.
Sister-in-law...
This is Anurag and Jyoti.
Anand's brother and his wife.
Be happy. Congratulations, Vivek.
Jyoti really takes care of Sangita.
Like a little sister.
- She is worth it.
Both my kids only stay with her.
Come and take her blessings.
Bravo!
All the young members of the
family must touch her feet.
The first is Vinod. Where is he?
Call Vinod.
- All right.
You...?
- I've come to see you.
To see me?
Uncle has called for you!
If we keep meeting like this,
someday you'll fall in love.
Touch your sister-in-law's feet.
We have a different tuning.
Touch her feet.
Can't straighten my back!
- What acting!
Prem, come on.
- Go on, son.
One moment. How can he touch
her feet? He's elder to her.
Prem is younger to Vivek so
she is elder to him in relation.
I am here, on the way.
Are you elder or younger to Vivek?
- Why?
We have to fix your relation with her.
What's my age?
- Whatever it be...
You are elder to me in every form.
No, dear sister-in-law!
You can't escape this bond.
He's loved Vivek more than a brother.
To tell the truth, he's handing
over his Vivek to you today.
Father...!
Now reduce your trips here.
Your friends belongs to her.
And the world is your foe.
Excuse me, but I'm one
of the shameless ones!
I'm not going to let go so easily.
Sister-in-law whether you
treat me as your own or not...
You are stuck with me!
Brothers and sisters...
The eldest daughter-in-law in
our nation is welcomed with love.
This function of today...
is to welcome the bride home!
"Listen to what we have
to say, dear bride."
"Meet your new family."
"We'll introduce you to all,
tell you their secrets too."
"First of all meet the head of
the family, your father-in-law."
"He is crowned with joys.
Take a look at him."
"I'm an inhabitant of Rampur.
My name is Ram Kishen."
"I talk and work straight."
"All that I ever wished for..."
"God granted my wishes."
"I travelled the world over."
"But I couldn't forget the
aroma of the soil of my village."
"The old jaggery, grams
and milk for breakfast..."
"I could never eat
with a fork and knife."
"Despite all this..."
"I still learnt these
new techniques with love."
"Now we'd like you to meet
your mother-in-law."
"She rules the household.
She has her special style."
"My name is Mumu..."
"Three butterflies are my
pals and I love parties!"
"I can haggle a mean
bargain while shopping."
"I'll only pay a buck
if it's worth just that."
"I have tall tales to tell but I
must leave for the beauty parlor."
"I love dressing up.
Forget the age catching up!"
"Dear bride, let's proceed to meet
your husband's sister and husband."
"He won't annoy his wife.
They are loving natured."
"Radhika's Daddy, come here."
"Darling, what's your command?"
"Tell me how my sari is."
"This admirer loves it."
"I have a headache.
- I'll press it for you."
"- I don't want to cook.
- Then I'll make dinner."
"Let's go out.
- Wherever you wish."
"We'll eat dinner out.
- Don't you worry."
"Then we'll also have ice cream."
"Order whatever you feel."
"Get me a sweet betel leaf."
"Smile a little, my darling."
"Carry my purse."
"Darling, it's your day."
"Now you must be alert, dear bride."
"Meet your youngest brother-in-law.
He's very naughty, amiable natured."
"His style is mischievous."
"Papa says I'll make
a name for myself."
"Our son will do some deeds."
"The dreams of Papa..."
"Will be fulfilled
by this young man.
"Innocent face, mischief in
mind, big talk but small job."
"The one who sleeps till 8..."
"Such men never make it big."
"Those who have dreams
in their eyes..."
"They are not
conscious of themselves."
"He wants to win every way."
"He is a jug with no base."
"Beauty has many airs."
"Dear bride, pay attention."
"Meet your elder brother-in-law."
"He's the monarch of
his mother's heart."
"Shyness is his trademark."
"He neither meets my eyes nor
talks to me, behaves like a saint."
"He neither meets my eyes nor
talks to me, behaves like saint."
"Opens his book and
continues revision."
"Prem is in love with Preeti."
"Still waters run deep
is true for Prem.
"Why are you so studious?
Try to learn the art of loving."
"As long as you were abroad,
I was in such a state..."
"Like a fish out of water."
"My beloved is home!"
"Whether studies are
completed or not."
"Get them engaged, dear Mummy."
"Dear bride, hold on
to your heart now."
"It's the turn of your beloved."
"He has no secrets.
His style is different from all."
"He is like an open book."
"There's nobody in the family
who is not proud of him."
"Listen oh bride,
we'll tell you a secret."
"He is the mirror who has
no secrets in it's heart."
"This Uncle of ours is
dearer than the moon to us."
"Don't forget us because
your wife has come."
"Dear uncle, loving uncle."
Come... Come on!
Welcome, to be sister-in-law.
Where were you all this while?
- Blushing away.
Wondering if Prem is here.
Don't be silly. He's hiding
somewhere, scared of you!
Aren't you ashamed to
make fun of brother Prem?
You're no less!
All said and done, you really
trapped Prem with the picture joke!
And trapped him so beautifully!
I overheard the elders talk.
Tomorrow they've planned a prayer
and Prem's engagement to Preeti!
You're getting engaged today!
Dress up, look smart.
Why the tension, little guy?
Mummy, he is all dressed.
I think your dearest son
has some deep worries.
Stop reading and get up.
Sadhna, put the
necklace round his neck.
It's the right of a sister-in-law.
Now tell us, why are you silent?
What can I say?
- Mother wants to know if you're happy.
You should have asked Preeti once.
Is she happy?
What's the matter?
This is why I'd advised you
to send him to a co-ed school!
Quiet. Sadhna, you convince him.
Silly boy!
Let's go.
A girl talks through her eyes.
Since yesterday ecstasy brims
over from Preeti's eyes.
Lift your eyelids and
look at yourself in the mirror.
You look magical!
Praise to Lord Satyanarayan!
Here is the engagement ring.
Prem, slip the ring on her finger.
Wow!
Why are you calling Mummy?
- Get out of her apron strings now!
She is waiting.
From today, Preeti is officially ours.
Good, you take over the tension.
I can't guarantee what kind of
housewives, doctors turn out to be.
But they make good daughters.
You've given us too much!
- It's hardly anything.
We're grateful that Anurag
could give us so much time.
We had to come.
I'm asking you for the last time.
Will you come with us
or stay with aunt?
You've wielded magic on them!
That's enough...
- Bye, brother.
This is what Rampur
looked like 1 5 years ago.
We'd go to the village
during every vacation.
He was very fond of photography.
Drink your tea!
That's our ancestral home.
Ragu uncle looks so young!
He looks after the house.
Good day.
And those are the little kids.
Sister-in-law, recognize them.
Our train goes...
I'll tell you. This is Vivek.
This is Prem.
Prem, do you know, you've got
thrashed the most from your mother?
He was the most stubborn.
And that is Sangita!
That is Vinod!
And who is this, Sapna?
Is that me?
Is that me, grandma?
Sister-in-law, that's
Vivek teaching us.
All together. Great...
Move aside!
Repeat after me.
Look at the lovebirds.
Brother Prem and Preeti.
Who is that?
- You tell me?
It's me!
How they would fight
at every little thing!
And quickly make up. Take a look!
What are you doing here?
Time flies by so fast, isn't it?
How long does it take
for time to go by?
You've just about come and
will leave tomorrow morning.
We meet just once a year.
The rest of the time,
we laugh and even cry.
Is that so?
- I have a request.
Don't remove the childhood
love from your heart.
Whenever you think of me,
pray that we meet soon.
Wow! What a thought!
May I ask you something?
You won't be offended?
I'm sitting here only
to talk to you of love.
You might as well say it.
The way you joke with me
from childhood to date...
You talk of this and that.
Is it nothing special
or is there something...?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
What would you say if
I ask you this same question?
I asked you first.
What was the question?
Think of the question all night.
And answer me in the morning.
Listen...
When will it be morning?
Get up...
Sorry, I'm late!
Grandma, you're leaving so early?
Stay for a while.
Unlike you, the train is bang
on time, not a minute late.
I'll go and drop them to the station.
You keep sleeping. Brother
and I are going. Grandma...
Grandma...
Papa is absolutely right.
One must get up early or
half the jobs get left undone.
I accept that.
If you've understood that,
hear this too...
The jobs not done today
will be completed tomorrow.
Each morning gets a ray
of sunshine when it comes.
I must note this down.
Prem, show the bride the office.
Come on.
This room is of us brothers.
- That's Vivek's table.
That is Prem's and
this is Vinod's.
Sit here, on big boss Vivek's chair.
What will you have?
- Get some juice...
Let's have a party!
Let Vivek come. We have to
discuss something important.
I'll just...
- Come on, brother!
Yes, what seems to be the problem?
You've barely been married for
2 days and you've joined work!
People generally go out
after their wedding.
Where will you take your
wife for your honeymoon?
One minute. Wherever we go,
we'll all go together.
How crazy! What will the
others do on your honeymoon?
How else can we all be together?
If you agree,
we'll make a program or...
No, don't cancel it!
We're not tagging along.
- Yes, he's taking us!
That's good. All of you
children must go out.
You too, Preeti.
What do you say?
At least say, yes!
You're the only one who won't come.
- Why?
He hasn't gone to his shop
for the past three weeks.
Forget it!
You've forgotten you're going
on a tour with the band.
Is he a friend or my enemy?
All right, this time
you win and I lose.
Tell me where you want to go.
I'll get the tickets.
Tell us!
- Just a minute. She'll tell us.
Shall we go to Rampur?
Say that once again.
"Great are the days of vacations."
"Wish you're always with me."
"Turm into kids with the kids."
"Let's play and gamble with them."
"Turn into a cloud or
a bird and fly away."
"That's a great feeling!"
"Let's go to the
lanes of our village."
"The heart is lost in the
memories of childhood."
"Holding the arms of her brothers..."
"Their sister will dance once again."
"The swings of monsoon,
the courtyard of her Dad..."
"...She'll see them again."
"Listen to what the cool wind
quietly comes and tells us."
"We are close to our destination."
"The clouds ask us to gather joys."
"Conceal from all eyes,
hide in your heart..."
"Spin dreams."
Welcome, Vivek.
We've been waiting for you
since this morning.
Really?
We're waiting to welcome you
with the flowers for ages...
Honest?
- Absolutely!
All the way here, I had the answer
to your question memorized in my heart.
I didn't know, I wouldn't
need to say a single word.
Both of us have been
tied together in a bond.
Where can you go?
Come on, kids.
Have some fresh guavas!
You'll find a lot of Rajasthani
color in our attire and speech.
My heart is overjoyed to see you.
What are you explaining to her?
She has lived abroad.
I'm introducing her to the village.
I've heard that people in
the cities are so busy...
They don't have time
to eat meals in peace.
That is why people from cities
come to the village for holidays.
They get peace of mind here.
Grandma, we've left
those lanes far behind.
But excuse me, what's
left in this village?
Neither planes come
here nor mobile phones.
There's a shortage of electricity!
We've left the electricity way behind.
We're going for a walk.
Coming.
Come on.
- You go ahead.
I'll help the ladies in the kitchen.
You too were supposed
to go for the walk.
Who said?
- You said so a while ago.
You've reformed...
- No...
Shall we...?
Come on!
Brother! Elder brother!
We came for a walk
but here we're running!
Shall we return?
- Just a little further.
I want to show Prem how far
the factory has progressed.
Prem, come on.
Come on.
This is the site.
Production will begin in a few months.
Can we check the progress of the
factory from close quarters later?
I'm feeling terribly cold!
Okay, we'll sit here for sometime.
Won't Papa be terribly happy
when the factory is operational.
What are you thinking of?
Nothing.
- I think he's starving.
Go for a run. I have to
talk to Prem about something.
Talk to him at home.
After breakfast.
Which way do I go? Not this way
it's all uphill.
What's the matter?
Brother...
When you see poverty and
difficulties around you...
Helplessness writ large
on the faces of people.
Don't you then feel...
What is all this for?
Sometimes I feel my education,
my Masters Degree...
Everything seems futile.
We can't run away from the truth.
Will your thinking
diminish somebody's sorrow?
If you want to share their sorrow...
Do something that will
bring joy to their lives.
Look at this plant.
When it is operational...
This place will always have power.
This is Papa's dream.
For the progress of this village.
For the future of those kids
who will be me and you tomorrow.
You have a lot to do in life.
Study hard. At this point
this is your only duty.
Yes, you do have another duty.
Towards Preeti.
A girl gives up everything for you.
She behaves the way you'd want her to.
In return, she only
asks for a little love.
I know you do lover her a lot.
But you have to express
the love in your heart.
Bring the words in
your heart to your lips.
And you'll see how she blooms.
Have you guys finished talking?
- Yes.
Anything serious?
I'll talk to you when the time comes
You've made excellent
dumplings, sister-in-law!
We made them. I had no idea
you could cook so well.
Prem, now taste this
and tell us how it is.
No! Please...
What's the matter?
When we insisted, for the first
time, she made Prem's favorite sweet.
And she's feeling shy to serve it.
She thinks it's not good enough.
Prem will certify whether
it's good or not. Serve him.
Just a second.
The video too is ready.
How is it?
- Good.
Good or very good?
Very good.
- Then take some more.
I will.
- Here you are!
Brother's face is
as red as the sweet!
I am feeling shy!
Don't be so conscious. I'm
taking your photo with them.
Speak in our tongue.
Prem, put the picnic bags in the bus.
The sweet dish was very good.
I was making it for the first time
I feared whether you'd like it.
You must make it again.
Stop riding and come here.
We're discussing the love life
of a king who lived 1000 years ago.
Look at that...
- So how many queens did he have?
100. Let's go to the umbrella.
See how lucky he was!
I swear! Had it been me...
And this is the palace of the queens.
They say, the youngest queen
was the most beautiful one!
She's sing in her melodious
voice among her friends.
And dance too.
Hearing the sound of their
music and their anklets...
Hundreds of peacocks
would dance here with them.
Do they still come here?
The sky is overcast with clouds.
Beautiful ladies stand before us.
How can the poor peacocks escape?
Continue the romance.
Look at that.
What is it? Peacock?
- No, elephants.
Elephant?
Prem is a different kettle of fish.
Sometimes he rides horses.
Otherwise he gets elephants.
Come, I'll take you
for an elephant ride.
Come on, kids.
- Come here sister-in-law.
- I'm going ahead.
Preeti, sit here.
Have fun! Give her a hand.
Everybody be seated.
Sit down.
Where do I go?
- Come here.
- Everybody hold hands.
Take me carefully.
I mustn't fall down.
I haven't even got engaged.
My friend, the elephant.
Praise be Lord Ganesha.
Look at the peacock!
- Where is it?
- There!
How beautiful!
Yes, truly beautiful!
"My heart..."
"Peacock dance in my heart."
"The black bee screeches
and my heart blooms."
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?"
"Peacock dance in my heart."
"The black bee screeches
and my heart blooms."
"Has the season changed or
the scenario or my perspective?"
"You are a newly wed bride.
You reflect radiant love."
"Henna on your hands and kohl in
eyes brings a sparkle to my life."
"You came as the answer
to my questions, my love."
"Peacocks dance in my heart."
"We're tied in such a bond
I've madly fallen in love."
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?"
"The season of love is here.
It has sprung love everywhere."
"The secret that was in my heart
has finally come to my lips."
"I'll install you in my heart and
take you to the kingdom of love."
"Peacocks dance in my heart."
"Take me wherever you please,
I'll follow you, my dearest."
"Has the season changed or the
scenario or simply my perspective?
"The procession of the moon and
stars brought this glorious moment."
"What a great moment!
The queen of my dreams is with me."
"You troubled me so much.
Today I won't let go your arm."
The moon light night is beautiful!
It's bright outside. Only
we don't have current.
How can that be?
I'll take a look.
The current is back?
What do you think?
I'll just be back.
Welcome!
My dear fellow, congratulations
on your daughter's engagement.
What are you doing?
We've come to ask you
for your child's hand.
Mummy and Papa are here.
- They're asking for you.
- I won't go!
Strange! You're getting
engaged today and look at you.
Tease me, go on.
You're the one who spread
the tale of the fuse off!
Everyone is laughing!
What will Mummy and Papa think?
Mummy was really mad at you. Said
nobody in the family behaved like you!
I'm dead!
- I'll say it was your ideal.
- Want to kill me?
Tell them the light
went off by chance.
Please, my Moms!
Come on.
Good Lord!
- The light went off by chance.
- Really? - It wasn't my fault.
Isn't it?
Brother and his wife are to be blamed.
They said, get engaged.
So I said, all right.
- It finishes one job.
- Oh, I see.
Come on, Mummy.
"Mother Yashodha..."
"This son of yours..."
"Mother Yashodha, this son of yours..."
"Holds my arms at the riverbank."
"He troubles me a lot,
keeps fighting with me."
"I was spared thanks to Lord Rama."
"Mother Yoshodha, this son of yours..."
"holds my arms at the river bank."
"He troubles me a lot,
he keeps fighting with me."
"I was spared thanks to Lord Rama."
"In the streets of Gokul,
on the banks of the Jamuna."
"He shyly throws pebbles at me."
"He's so mischievous but
his countenance innocent."
"He drenches my blouse
when Holi comes by."
"He won't leave my arm."
"He twists my wrists."
"He won't leave my arm."
"He twists my wrists."
"I fall at his feet yet
he won't leave me in peace."
"He traps me with his sweet words."
"Each time Mohan plays the flute..."
"My anklets start to
dance on their own."
"When he teases me with his eyes..."
"The damsel foolishly in love
holds on to heart for dear life."
"She has lost her heart."
"She has lost her sleep."
"She has lost her heart."
"She has lost her sleep."
"She couldn't do what
she set out to do."
"With great difficulty,
she controlled her heart."
"Thanks to Lord Rama"
"The Kanha of Gokul
lives in every heart."
"Fortunate am I that I found him."
"Agreed that he belongs to all."
"Yet he will always be yours, mother."
"He's a beloved."
"You've given him to us."
"He's a beloved."
"You've given him to us."
"You've taken us into your
shield of maternal love."
"Oh mother, we have
to live at your feet."
"Thanks to Lord Rama's kindness."
Come here.
Why are you sitting there
with the old guys? Come here.
Only waiting for you.
You will first hava a son
followed by a daughter.
What formula is this?
It's simple. If the ring is
straight, it will be a son.
If it spins, it will be a girl.
And if it doesn't spin, full stop.
What a scientific method!
He's fond of reading from various
sources and using it to impress.
Man should view every new
thing with curiosity.
And it was true in our case.
Preeti, now it's your turn.
Come on, show your hand.
Now everybody is interested.
You'll just have a
sweet little boy. Happy?
Yes, now it's your turn.
Son...
Daughter.
Son. Daughter.
Son. Daughter.
Son. Daughter.
Son. Daughter...
I've had it!
I was pulling your leg.
- Give me your hand.
- I won't.
- Why? - What's this?
Do you have to return today?
What has cropped up that
Anurag has called you today?
It must be important or
brother wouldn't have called.
Today we were planning a
picnic to the factory site.
We won't enjoy without the kids.
We'll plan another trip after
Prem and Vinod get married.
Papa, we'll all go together.
By then the seat next
to your should be full.
I've fixed my program
with sister-in-law.
When they will be three,
we will be two.
We'll take leave.
It's time.
We didn't realize how these days
flew by in games and laughter.
30 years ago, I left
this village with a dream.
I wanted to do something so that
the villagers wouldn't have to...
...leave their families
and go far for work.
Today I see that dream taking shape.
Brother and Bhaijaan are waiting
for us at the site. We'll go there.
- Let's go to work.
- Shall we stay here?
We're all waiting for the
factory to be inaugurated.
The moment the plant is inaugurated
we'll hear the wedding bells.
The date for the wedding
matches this perfectly.
Now we're just waiting
for that auspicious date.
And I hand over the business
to my sons and be carefree.
I've decided to hand charge of the
company, the directorship to Vivek.
I'd made her a promise.
Once our sons are married,
all my time will be hers.
So the daily appointments
dairy will be with her?
You will be burdening Vivek
with a huge responsibility.
He deserves it every way.
Wow! What news!
Congratulations!
You don't understand anything.!
If Vivek becomes the
company managing director...
Adarsh will be one up on us!
- That is true.
- What will our son-in-law have?
They will always have to obey Vivek.
They will have to beg
him for every little thing!
What shame in asking
your elder brother?
Power can corrupt. Family
relations are forgotten.
This concerns our daughters too.
You are very good friends.
Do something and stop
this from happening.
Take the wife into confidence.
- Why? - The minds of women
work better in this regard.
Don't worry. Follow me.
We don't understand your
making Vivek the MD.
- Why?
- Is that fair to us?
With Vinod and Prem?
Such an important announcement
and you simply said it.
No party, no celebration.
Dharmraj is most upset about this.
That is why he has decided that
tomorrow before we leave for town...
He will distribute Jaipur
sweetmeats to the village!
Why did you have to do this?
May the Lord always be kind to you.
My good fellow, everybody
is blessing you for this!
All of you are leaving.
We will be left alone.
That is why we leave Sapna with you.
Or we'd take her along.
Next time, I'll bring him along.
He'll stay here for a few
days to learn the work.
I'll come here to work
but not make small talk.
If I get the time...
When do you leave for
your studies abroad?
Tomorrow night.
Here are the sweets and savories.
Keep them in the bag.
I didn't make them.
Did you...?
Preeti made them. Don't you dare
distribute them amongest friends!
When will you return?
How can I say?
Only till the exams.
Then he'll be with you.
Write a love letter to mother
everyday instead of to Preeti.
- You spoke again!
- The flight is on time. Hurry up.
You come here, I'll show you!
Shall we leave?
You may stay.
This is very good.
Going on a world trip with your wife.
You'll have Prem's
company on the flight.
You're keeping the promise
you gave your wife.
And I'm keeping mine.
Leave this veil behind for some days.
She'll wear jeans abroad.
Come here. Sit with Papa today.
I had to make an important phone call.
Try to understand the important
phone call after engagement!
This will be a daily occurrence.
Did you decide the
color for your room?
Prem, let us know your choice too.
I have to make rooms for both
of you before your marriages.
Vinod has given me a long list.
You too must tell me.
What can I say? As Preeti wishes.
He has really changed.
I'll just say this. All three boys
should have similar rooms.
They are the same. Vivek's is up
stairs and Prem and Vinod are down.
They too should have rooms upstairs.
Why shouldn't they get a garden view?
Later these are the issues that
will create fights between them.
She's laughing.
- Uncle is here.
- Good day to you.
Welcome.
Since when do you have this ailment?
Excuse me, I think I'm
going through a bad phase.
Get them in.
I've brought some sweets
for Janmashtami, from Agra.
Pass them here!
You are our favorite
relative from all the three!
Call Papa in the office
and tell him brother is here.
Don't disturb him in work.
I've come to meet sister.
First of all do something for us.
What can I say in family matters?
You have all the rights.
- You're giving your daughter!
- Yes. That's right.
You get after every little thing!
Excuse me.
Sangita here.
I've been thinking
of you since morning.
- How are the kids?
- All fine.
Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, is Vivek home?
- He's in the office.
I'll talk to him there.
Nothing special. Bye.
Don't worry. Give the line to Anand.
Something important cropped up.
We'll discuss this later.
I don't know what exactly happened
between Anand and Anurag.
But Sangita and Anand
are quite worried.
They have called me there.
Why are you crying?
What's the matter?
You are aware that we have
been a tight knit family.
Brother Anurag, Jyoti,
Sangita, me and the three kids.
We've had no ill feelings.
Since Anurag called us from Rampur...
He seemed changed.
I thought it was tension of work.
But yesterday he called us and said...
We must look for a separate business.
A separate home.
Anurag said that? I can't believe it.
It is true.
After doing computer engineering
my work has been technical.
Brother looked after the
company accounts and finances.
When he transfered the company
property and shares to his name...
We didn't realize it.
Tell me, did your father make a will?
- No, Uncle.
- Then forgive me...
Your brother has no legal
right to grab everything!
We can go to court and
stake a claim in everything!
You will get your right!
- No, Uncle.
- No?
The work that father started
with such love and efforts...
I don't want to drag it to court.
And then how can I fight my brother?
This concerns your life.
Life can be started again.
We thought we'd shift to Banglore.
It has a growing computer industry.
I have friends there.
I'll begin a new project.
That's not so simple.
And you have the responsibility
of Sangita and Radhika.
That's the only thought
that makes me nervous.
Then I called Vivek.
When he was in agreement
with my decision...
I took Anurag's blessings and left.
Did we take the right decision?
We're all proud of you.
The only sad part is...
The family is broken.
They will be one again.
Absolutely.
Come here, baby.
Come to me, child.
I'm very worried.
How will Anand establish
his work alone in a new city?
There's no need to worry.
I just spoke to Mr. Richard.
He's our agent in London
who also deals in computers.
He wants Anand to join him and
look after the South India business.
And there's no problem
about accomodatiion there.
I have a flat there.
Sangita can be comfortable.
Vinod and I will leave
for Banglore today itself.
We'll return only after settling them.
Consider these
difficult times a test.
You'll see there's some
good hidden in this too.
- Take this, my dear.
- May I take two more?
Sure. Here.
One for Raju and
the other for Bablu.
I'll give it when we meet.
Radhika will miss
Raju and Bablu a lot.
Shall we leave?
Yes brother.
See you Mummy.
Take care dear.
"In happy times or sad..."
"They who come to the Lord's
refuge face no obstacles."
"Time and religion may fail you."
"Surrender yourself at the
Lord's feet and gain solace."
"Mother don't let your mind
get poisoned by unfortunate."
I'm very worried.
What happened to Anand
shouldn't happen to us.
I don't understand...
I've come here from Rampur
only to explain this to you!
Ram Kishen is appointing Vivek
the Managing Director. That's good.
But in the future if there's a
misunderstanding between the brother?
What he means is, getting charge of
the business like Anurag if Vivek...
...blesses Vinod and Prem and
sends them out of the house.
Vivek loves his brothers
more than his own self!
Excuse me but the most loving
man changes on getting power.
You sang praise of Anurag.
What happened?
Truthfully speaking, I couldn't
bear to see Sangita's sad face.
The thought brings tears to my eyes!
The ones whose children
played in Sangita's lap...
Played with Mumu... They did this!
With the real brother!
If a real brother could do this,
don't forget Vivek is a step brother!
You can't deny the truth.
Yes, today Anand is
facing such problems.
He called Vivek to advise him
about what to do.
And what did Vivek do?
Tell me the truth, if he really
had the heart of a brother...
Would he leave his sister mid stream?
He would fight, do anything!
He'd get her her rights!
He wouldn't wash his hands
off his sister's responsibility.
You and your husband are very generous.
You bore your daughter's
sorrows with a smile.
But if this same thing
happens to Prem or Vinod...
Pritam and I won't be
able to bear this sorrow.
We've given our daughters to you.
Now their joys and good
fortune lie in your hands.
What are you doing?
Vinod will fight and have his way.
But what about Prem?
Don't we all know him?
He's way apart from worldliness.
At least think of him.
Your husband's dream is great.
The entire family
lives together happily!
But is it possible?
Can two brides live
together without fighting?
- Show me one house.
- Don't forget...
The man who runs the office,
his wife rules the home.
In the future if Sadhna doesn't
make Preeti and Sapna...
dance to her tune...
I'll eat my words.
In your shoes I would never hand
the family to Vivek and Sadhna!
The truth is however much
you may love Vivek and Sadhna...
He is not your own!
He is not your blood!
Yes Sangita, is
everything settled there?
I see, Anandbabu has gone
to the office with Vivek?
And what is little Radhika doing?
She's having breakfast.
Here, talk to her.
Grandpa, I'm drinking milk by myself.
I too am drinking milk.
- How did you land there?
- For goodies made by my daughter.
In fact, I suggest you
come here with your wife.
I'll talk to her.
Talk to him.
Vivek and I will return by evening.
Finally, the daughter is happy.
Mummy hasn't eaten a
thing since last night.
She seems very worried.
Send her breakfast upstairs.
I'll talk to her.
I just spoke to Sangita.
She is happy.
No need to worry.
Let's go to her for some days.
She will appreciate it.
What's the matter?
Some other worry?
I don't want Prem and Vinod to
go through Anand's experience.
What do you mean?
Why are you appointing
Vivek the Managing Director?
Is that all?
Can Vivek ever treat
his brothers in this way?
Ask your own heart.
You know him better than I do.
I know that this family has 3 sons.
Instead of giving everything to one
divide everything between them.
What are you saying?
It's not too late.
It will be done with love.
And I want it done before
Prem and Vinod get married.
Do you know what you're saying?
Split them up? Separate
Vivek, Prem and Vinod?
These children are our dreams!
- You want to break them up?
- What dreams are you talking of?
Our daughter has been
thrown out of her own home!
Haven't we experienced
highs and lows in life?
Why are you becoming weak today?
This is the time we must stay close
and give strength to our daughter.
I don't want to argue with you.
For the first time
I'm asking you for something.
And I want it.
What you want, you're
asking for... is wrong!
- Breakfast.
- I'm not hungry.
Mother.
I know you are very upset at
what happened with Anand and Sangita.
Your thinking that this shouldn't
happen in our family too is right.
But if we split up like this...
If this house is broken into three...
Will we be happy?
Think about it. When
Sangita comes for rakhi...
To which brother's house
will she go first?
And we still have to
make Vinod's career.
His innocence will be stifled
in the division of business.
Don't punish everybody for me.
Don't break everyone up.
I don't want to be
the Managing Director.
Sadhna and I will go to Rampur.
The new plant has to be looked after.
We'll stay there.
I'll tell Papa to make
Prem the Managing Director.
I assure you that Prem and Vinod
will never suffer as long as I live.
Sadhna has brought you dinner.
Eat a little. For our sake.
Come on, mother.
What are you saying?
Both of you will go to Rampur!
Yes, Vinod.
What's wrong with it?
Prem will look after everything here.
And Rampur is not far
Just a few hours away.
All right then. If you
have decided to go...
And Mummy is happy about it...
Then I too will go with you!
- No Vinod.
- Nobody will go anywhere!
Nobody will go anywhere.
May I come in, sir?
Yes, come in.
Have you brought all the papers?
Give it another thought.
No, Khan.
The time for seperation is here.
Sadhna and I are leaving
for Rampur today.
You won't go anywhere!
I've given my word to mother.
Mother, we're leaving.
Vinod insists of coming along.
I'll send him back soon.
I'd also like to say this...
Why this is happening?
The reason behind it...
People will ask us. Don't
keep a load on your heart.
No mother will wish ill for her son.
Forgive me, father.
I hurt you.
Silly boy. Do the words
of a son hurt a father?
You are going. Go.
I won't stop you.
Emulate every quality of your brother.
Only the fortunate are blessed
with such a son and brother.
What can I tell you?
We brought her home
with such splendor.
Isn't it?
Excuse my saying this but
this is the law of the world...
Gradually bonds break up.
The times you spend together are yours.
I'm glad you are keeping
yourself busy with work.
I've studied all the papers. Begin
work on the electricity division.
From today Vinod will join
me at the factory site.
How do you feel now?
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, grandma.
Exhaustion, I guess.
Don't make Vinod work too hard.
That he will have to do.
He should have full knowledge of
production before the inauguration.
So he can return and take
training in finance and sales.
I won't go back.
I won't leave you and sister-in-law.
What rain!
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law...
They have returned.
How are you, Vinod?
- How was the first day at the site?
- Don't ask!
Today I realize how
hard brother works!
I'm starving!
Have a wash. Dinner is ready.
Go and call the little sir.
What happened?
He's dozed off.
That's because he worked hard today.
How sweet is the smile on his face.
The smile has returned to his face.
But I fear... when Prem returns...
How will I assure him?
I think we have talked about it.
Yes. Prem returns today.
Don't spoil our mood by
repeating the same thing.
Kindly leave us alone.
I want to talk to my sister.
I don't have anything
left to say to you.
The only sorrow is...
Today I have no face left
to meet Ram Kishen's eyes.
On whose instigation did you
do this? These butterflies?
Those who never settled down,
can't teach us to run our homes!
They only want to watch the scene!
They will end the play here and
go elsewhere for the curtains!
I am a lawyer.
I've seen families bickering,
relationships breaking up.
I can only say that nobody has
been happy breaking their families.
Nobody can be happy.
See for yourself! Your Prem has
gone straight to meet Vivek.
Instead of coming to see you!
This is not possible.
Why not?
Son, we will return
with you and Sadhna.
We've shared so many moments
of happiness with this family.
I won't let it be overcast
be clouds of sorrow!
Today is such a happy day.
We hear Sadhna's giving us good news.
Accompany Prem even if only
to share this good news!
Adarsh, you tell Vivek.
I understand your
feelings and Prem's too.
Nobody would be happier than me
if Vivek & Sadhna return to the fold.
But Vivek's silence says a lot.
Vivek is doing his duty.
You do yours.
Ram Kishen and the business needs you.
Aunt, it is Ram Kishen's values...
...that two brothers today
fight for each others' happiness.
All you brothers are the same.
One heart beats in all three chests.
For the first time I've
seen you brothers fighting.
The one we fight with...
we love him the most.
Listen to me, Prem.
Go back before I become weak.
The little fellow too is here.
How are you?
We're going to become Uncles.
You the elder one, me the younger.
Rosogollas from the sweetmeat shop.
The first one is for Uncle.
Bought specially for you.
- No, I won't eat today.
- Why?
Just don't feel like it.
- Not even one?
- Just half...
Have one. I'm glad though in
a way, we are together.
You don't talk to Prem.
We'll talk to him.
Sounds like him!
Did you call for me?
Yes, son. Come inside!
Come in and sit down.
Whatever your mother did,
good or bad...
It's for your good and Vinod's.
A mother gambles all that
she has for her children.
So don't be mad with your mother.
I say, what has she done?
Since she heard, Sadhana
is giving us good news...
We've been spreading joys!
We're distributing saris
to all the ladies in Club.
And this silver present for
all friends and relatives.
What else is required?
Even a real mother wouldn't do this.
May I leave?
Everything will remain the same.
Nothing here is the same.
Neither you nor me.
See what Vivek has written to me.
Today Prem has become
the Managing Director.
Stay with him all day.
Close to him.
He has never measured
relations with money.
We always considered his
simplicity his weakness.
Actually that is his strength.
Give him lots of love.
May I ask you something?
When the elder brother's love
and father's blessing are with you...
Why don't you sit on your chair?
Why here...?
This is elder brother's right.
Whenever he returns, whichever day...
He'll find everything the same.
You worry for no reasomn.
It will take Prem time to realize.
We achieved what we wanted.
He has become the Managing Director!
You just make his favorite
dishes and feed him yourself.
We'll see how long the son
will be mad with the mother.
Bye bhaijaan.
You haven't eaten a thing since
morning. Eat something now.
Yes Bhaijaan.
Wash up and come. Dinner is ready.
No, mother. I'm not hungry.
All your favorite dishes.
I made them.
I'm not hungry.
I've shifted your things
to the room upstairs.
Where are you going?
To bring my things
back from Vivek's room.
You and Preeti have to
stay here after marriage.
How did you even think of it?
The entire fault is mine!
I'm to be blamed!
I love you so much!
Fight the world for you!
Doesn't a mother have this right?
She does. Only if she doesn't
differentiate between the kids.
I didn't do anything.
Vivek left on his own.
And you let him go?
Tomorrow if I want to leave
everything and go away...
Will you let me go?
Won't you stop me?
Right from childhood, Vivek
has respected you more than us.
He has loved you the most.
And you forgot all this!
Try to recall. The Prem and Vinod
for whom you're fighting yourself...
They would have left you
and gone away long back!
If Vivek hadn't lost his
arm to save their lives!
For what happened to Sangita,
you're blaming brother Vivek.
Thinking of Sangita
brings tears to our eyes.
The name of Anurag
fills us with anger.
But are we less at
blame than Anurag?
The Sadhna whom we lovingly
brought home as a bride...
We made her a stranger in a moment!
When she waits at the
foot steps of motherhood!
Isn't this discrimination?
You've acted as a
step-mother, not Vivek!
Nobody can take the place
of brother Vivek and Sadhna.
Neither in this house nor in
this room. Nor in this heart.
And if your conditiion is that
I step into Vivek's shoes...
and Preeti into Sadhna's...
I swear by Sadhna,
I will never get married!
Uncle, forgive me.
I can't get married.
I knew this would be your decision.
The country that honors the brother
as a father and his wife as mother...
Prem will never crush their joys
to erect his own palace of dreams.
I knew it.
I had already told Preeti.
Won't you stay?
I wouldn't have been able to take
Sadhna's rights even if you asked me.
Sit down.
Whether we're tied in a bond or not...
We're tied in an
emotiional bond of hearts.
Isn't it?
Don't worry about Sadhna.
Her delivery is my responsibility.
It will be a normal delivery.
You might have to go to
the hospital any moment.
- Sit down.
- See what father sent for you.
A little Krishna.
He wants you to always keep
this idol in front of you.
- Give it to me.
- Why are you staying here?
- Sapna is here.
- I've taken official leave from sir.
I'm going to stay
here till you deliver.
Tea...
Doctor, Preeti is staying
here leaving all her work.
And Sapna isn't taking part
in her college cultural program.
I have three daughters not one.
Vinod will complete training by
the time the factory is inaugurated.
Then we'll send him back to the city.
Time just flew by
laughing with Sapna.
We didn't realize anything.
Time moves at its' own pace.
Time takes its' tests
all the time in some way.
I don't understand! Why has
productiion in the factory stopped?
We faced technical
problems earrlier too!
Sir, Anand could tackle them.
I've heard this a number of times.
Quickly appoint a good engineer.
In this manner, we won't be
able to clear the bank loans!
I'm on my way.
Now how are they?
They still have high temperature.
Jyoti mentioned that they haven't
been eating well for some days.
They've stopped playing too.
- Yes.
- Anyway continue the medicines.
Inform me tomorrow morning.
I have to talk to you.
I want to say something to
you as your family doctor.
Children are as delicate as flowers.
If they don't find a loving
enviroment, they wither away.
And that's not good.
I'm unable to give them time
because of my problems at work.
I often lose my temper with them.
Yesterday you raised your hand at them.
They were being stubborn.
They wanted to go to
Anand and Sangita.
Why don't you give in to them?
Don't lose the peace of your
family to personal grudges.
Or no doctor will be able to help.
Anand and his wife have come!
With Radhika!
Brother!
You didn't inform us that
Raju and Bablu were so ill.
We left as soon as
sister-in-law called up.
You didn't consider us family.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
What are you saying?
I had turned blind with selfishness.
I acheived one success
after another in business.
I assumed it was because of me.
But after Anand left, I found
out the success wasn't mine.
But of our team.
Since Anand left home,
without asking or taking anything...
I haven't had any peace.
I lost everything I had.
The happiness of the children.
The smile on Jyoti's face.
But we're together again!
We will live together.
Today is such a joyous day.
My daughter's house
is settled again.
We've come to ask you for something.
Ask brother Vivek to return home.
It was Vivek's belief that
we'll be together again.
I remember the day we were
leaving for Banglore...
He placed his hand on
my head and said...
All your sorrows be mine
May all my joys be yours.
I've committed a grave sin!
A grave sin!
Nothing is lost.
Look there.
No, Mamta.
You are the same Mamta for me.
...who gave our children
such a noble upbringing.
Made them such good humans.
Shall we go to Rampur?
We are going to be grandparents.
Yes, Sadhna needs you
the most at this hour.
Anything to worry about?
No, Sadhna is fine.
Start the final testing of the
machines. We're off to the hospital.
- Brother is here!
- Hurrah!
- You've become a Papa!
- You have a son!
Many congratulations.
- You...?
- Talk later.
Sangita, take him in.
Let's go.
Mother...
I've come to take my
daughter-in-law and grandson home.
I won't take him.
You left. Not once did
you ask your mother...
What is my fault?
Attentiion! The heir to the
family is making his entry!
- Give the baby to me!
- No!
- I'm the aunt!
- No!
It's the Papa's turn first.
No, first of all it's
the turn of Papa's mummy.
Aunt, compared to all
the joys of the world...
The joy of becoming a
grandmother is the best.
Mother, all of us are in
line to meet the baby.
- Me, first.
- Sure.
Aunt before the Uncle.
Let's love him together.
It's also the right of the elder
uncle and aunt to love the baby.
Yes, Prem.
One day for my sake...
You took a pledge in front of mother.
Today for my sake I want you,
You take another pledge.
Garland her.
Here is your Mummy!
- Okay, you may...
- I have garlanded her.
Sister-in-law, on thid joyous
occasion I've brought special sweets!
You really do too much!
Forgive me for all that I did
so far was with ulterior motives.
Blinded by love for my daughter.
I fed flour to the ants,
watered the god of the trees.
- Prayers, invocatioin...
- Yes, I did all that.
But I couldn't shake the
foundation of your family.
Mother Ram Kishen is right.
It's all a game of values.
