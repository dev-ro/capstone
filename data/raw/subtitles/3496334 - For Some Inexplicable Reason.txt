With the suppon of Hungarian National Film Fund,
Sim√© Sandor Alapitvany
- I died.
I'll never move again.
It'd be so simple.
I'm going to the museum to
check out some Monarchy coins
I die.
No clue what I'd be doing
at that exhibition, though.
Or I'm just walking at the lake and I die.
While taking a bath.
Or reading a film magazine
at the newsstand
on the metro, the tram,
underpass,
Astoria, Blaha square.
Anywhere I die,
nothing's gonna happen.
What's going to happen is happening now.
Yeah, looks about right.
Though I tried not to notice,
today I realized something.
Eszter didn't just take
her toothbrush with her,
her books I never read,
her photos from my wall
her fridge magnets we got on holidays
in Croatia and Amsterdam
but she took her hairs, too.
Eszter took her hairs
from the drain, and left me.
- Hi, Mom! - Hi, Aron!
Please don't be late for lunch.
- I'm getting ready.
- Is your CV done?
- Working on it.
I'm sitting in front of it.
- I'd like to take a look. And please
buy a flower for Anna. It's her name day.
For Some lnexplicable Reason
- Hi Dad!
- Hi, get in.
- What are you doing?
- You hearthat?
- What?
- It just whined.
Now.
- Listen, Dad.
- I gotta clean it out. What?
- I think Mom is waiting for us.
Shouldn't we go?
- Of course.
Let's get going.
Why the cactus?
- Mom asked me to get something
for Anna's name day.
- It's today?
Why didn't you all tell me?
Why am I always the last to knovxfl
- Could that be a present from both of us?
- Dad, I don't think you have to worry.
- I'm sure Mom bought
her something. - Fine.
- We're here!
- Hi!
- Shoes! I cleaned all day.
- Eszter isn't coming again?
- Well, no.
- Give me a hand, please.
- Let me whip you into shape.
- What are you doing?
- Your hair is a mess!
- You don't have to,
I'm 29 years old!
- What shampoo do you use?
Your hair is so... ugh.
When did you wash it?
- A present.
Happy binhday!
- Come on, Endre.
I wanted to wrap it!
- It's a camera.
- With 3 or 4 times zoom,
or megapixels or something.
Elizabeth, my Elizabeth.
You're still not dressed?
- Should I comb you, too?
- They'll be here any second.
- Happy birthday!
- A month and a half ago
Eszter was sitting here, too.
- Aron, I was thinking,
that you could talk to
Zsanett, the HR person.
- The rice and the spinach are good.
- Bazsika, we can't make out
what you're saying.
- Finish your resume, she can
help with the job interview.
- All right.
- The tomato could be better.
- I haven't tasted it.
- Tastes like water.
- I don't know, too much vinegar?
- It's got sugar and vinegar,
but it's the main ingredient.
- Endre, where did you buy them?
- Where you told me to.
- For 530.
- For 530?
That much?
- It's out there on the package.
- It's plastic wrapping?
- They had to wrap it...
- Then it can't be Hungarian!
- I bought it in Hungary!
- Sure.
- I bought it in here, they're Hungarian
in Hungarian vinegar.
- I told you to, but you didn't get
the tomatoes from Rozi!
Then they would be Hungarian.
What a joke!
- Next time I'll take my
tomato handbook to the grocer!
Last time, when I got
the parsley? - Yes?
- You were perfectly content,
but you know where I got them?
In Auchan!
- I knew it!
What's wrong? Anna!
- Get her something!
- So, I guess this
is the moment
to tell you we're
past the third month,
there's going to be
a new member in the family.
- Oh, my little baby,
my little big son.
Anna!
- I'm gonna be a grandfather.
- Why am I scared,
if I have a monthly pass?
- Tickets, passes, please.
Tickets!
Thank you.
It'll expire soon.
- I'm Balazs Szentesi, 33 years old.
I started a small Italian restaurant
3 years ago in the suburbs.
- I'm Tamas Juhasz.
I'm 30.
I do logistics for
an event management company.
I make about
120-130 thousand forints.
- My name is Miklos Hamza,
I'm 31, working as a translator.
I rent this place and
I don't have a girlfriend.
- I'm Balint Gyorvari, I'm 31,
I rent a place in Buda.
I have a law degree, but I'm
a project manager at a web developer.
I make 220 grand,
minus my auto lease and student loan.
- It's Saturday.
The day after tomorrow is Monday.
Monday I stan writing my book.
I'm really going to stan it.
- I take her home, everything goes smooth.
Upstairs, bedroom, bed.
Everything's working out, fucking great!
And I fucking blow it.
From the first moment,
she staned screaming!
Fucking louder
than I've ever heard.
"Ich komme! lch komme"
- Oh my god.
- At first I said
"Ah, whatever". But fuck!
It was so annoying,
I just couldn't go.
She wanted to "come"
and I couldn't "go".
- You know Hungarians "go"
and foreigners "come".
- In English it's "coming", too.
- Really?
- That's for the binhday boy!
- No... What's that?
You got me a tanker?
- You're only 30 once!
- I'm 29, and I don't drink.
I'll just sit here quietly.
- He doesn't like the taste.
- Doesn't like the taste?!
- Sorry guys,
it's closing time.
- That's ours, yeah. OK.
- 750, no.
- No, 1500, coffee is 600, what?
- Coffee?
- I drank one waiting for you.
- You drink coffee, are you a pussy?
- Cut it out!
- I would say... Miki!
- Two beers, that's 500.
- If I put in 600...
- You don't put in anything,
you're the binhday boy...
- Oh, fuck me!
- Are you looking at chicks?
- No, take a look at this.
- Isn't that Eszter?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Who's the dude?
It was taken last week.
- It got a lot of likes.
- Who's the dude?
- No idea.
- Just forget it.
- Did you break up?

Your reservation: Budapest-Lisbon
Traveler: Aron Szentesi
- Hello? - Hey, Miki.
Am I disturbing you?
- Go on.
- It's just that yesterday...
Can you tell me a bit about
what happened yesterday?
- Can I call you back?
- Hey there.
- Hi, Balint. Listen.
I know it sounds stupid,
usually you ask me this,
but what happened last night?
- Okay, listen:
We had beers and spritzers in Krimo.
That picture showed up,
made you a little unruly.
Then came those
beautiful Finlandia girls.
We drank in Wichmann,
Miki ate something.
We moved. Tomi talked us
into vodkas in Caesar.
From there we went to 400.
Then all the rest...
- What do you mean rest?
- Well, the rest of them.
We hit Gozsdu.
Then we went for kebabs.
Fuge was next! Yeah, those
gorgeous Finlandia chicks.
That idiot, that French guy
convinced us,
to go over to Fogashaz,
then I went home.
- There were those Finlandia girls...
- I could give two fucks about
the Finlandia girls, to be honest!
Problem is, I bought
a fucking airline ticket.
- Fuck. Yeah,
we all meant to buy them.
There was that Ponuguese kid.
- What Ponuguese?
- The one Tomek brought.
You'd already puked
a bunch of times.
- Tomi, what the fuck
is this ticket?
- Yeah, you bought a ticket.
- Tomi, why did I do that?
- We were in Anker.
There was a Ponuguese guy.
We were talking about Figo,
what a great player he was.
Then we talked about another one.
- I think it stafied with Balint
about Hungarians going
and foreigners coming.
- She gave me her number on some
Finlandia shit. Do you have that?
- I don't give a shit.
- He went on about
how great Ponugal is.
- Could you bring some
sour cream for lunch?
- We all meant to go,
but I didn't have money on my card.
- She wrote her name
on something.
- Which sour cream?
- A Hungarian one, please.
- You seemed sober, when you decided.
- All I'd like is a refund somehow.
I didn't buy it on purpose.
It was completely accidental.
I didn't really...
- So.
At dawn today, I got a text.
- Endre...
...easy.
- It said that somebody withdrew...
140000, for... what was it?
Mother couldn't sleep.
- Tap Pon.
- Some pon took away...
you know about this?
- Tap. - Tap or Pon,
I don't know but he did.
- The Ponuguese airline.
- Say what?
- How are you involved?
- Because, well, I bought...
...a ticket to Lisbon.
~ What?!
- What did you buy?
What is this?
- Say something, my dear son!
- We're talking 140 thousand forints!
Two months rent for you!
What am I going to tell Simonyi?
- Endre, calm down.
- Your mother
works herself to death.
And you're buying a ticket
for 140 thousand!
You've got money for this?
We've got no more money.
What do you want? Are you insane?
- I'd just like to say...
- Have you ever worked in your life?
For one second?
- Endre! Tell your father...
- We pay for you, a 29 year old!
- We're not paying...
- You buy a plane ticket!
And there's no sour cream
in this goddamn soup!
- Look at the state he's in.
- And there's none at home.
No sour cream in this house
and you bought a plane ticket!
I'm getting some.
- Why are you going
to Lisbon? Aron?
- Because...
- Aron.
- Get yourself together.
- Eszter left.
- Fine. Where did Eszter go?
Come on, say it.
- She went to Lisbon...
...with Erasmus...
- Yes, and?
- ...and she feels bad.
- You have to get a job,
to get all that money.
Okay?
- Why didn't you tell us?
- What?
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I don't know, Miki.
It doesn't work like that.
- Okay?
- Remember in December at Fogashaz?
You guys were drinking.
We played some ping pong.
When the student
demonstrations were going on.
- Yeah, yeah. - And it was so
important, to talk about that.
- If you were a student,
you'd be on the streets too!
- No, no, no, no, no!
- But...
- What I'm saying now
that I wanted to say it then,
but we were talking
about that shit.
I wanted to tell you she left me.
I'm standing there. And you
are all standing in front of me,
you all ended up on one side,
and you had the serve.
You're standing in a bunch,
and I'm standing by myself.
You all are screaming
about Rozsa Hanmann.
- Hoffman! Yeah, whatever.
- April 1997 came to mind, you knovxfl
April 1997
I was in love with Vivien Csatlos,
David Amigo's girlfriend.
I got up the courage
to confess my feelings to her.
I wrote a letter, but unfonunately
David got hold of it first.
Miki and the others watched
David beat me up.
And they didn't help me.
- You pull out David Amigo, again?
- I'm lying on the ground, you know.
- David Amigo again?
It's ridiculous!
Whenever you have a problem
you play your wild card...
Why do I have to hear this all the time?
- You didn't help me!
You guys had 120 kilos on him!
- What fucking kilos?
We talked this over at graduation!
- And we just sit here
talking past each other.
This isn't friendship!
We don't look out for each other.
- You think so? Fuck it.
- Excuse me...
- Exhausting, yeah! The girl from marketing
talked so much. Unbelievable.
The food was so bad.
Avocado cream or avocado salad...
sitting in a creamy juice
and it was brown like a rotten pear.
The salmon...
- Hello.- Hello,
so I'm in the right place.

How can I help you?

I tried to call, to tell you...
I thought about it

She has some time for you.

...I'm in the wrong place.
- Yes?
- I'm Aron Szentesi.
I just came from upstairs...
...because my mom works there.
She's Lizzie Szentesi. I'm not sure...
- You're Lizzie's son, Aron?
Why didn't you stan with that?
I'm Zsanett Kovago. Aron, right?
- Yes, Aron.
- Take a seat, put your bag down.
- I was a bit confused.
- I've been waiting for you, Aron!
- Really? Then everything's fine.
- Sit comfonably.
As if this would be a job interview.
- All right.
- Good? Good.
- Job interview, that's great.
- Here's your CV.
- Sorry, my what?
- Your mother sent it this morning.
I'll just scan it quickly.
- It says, Aron,
that you're creative, reliable,
with good communication skills,
also determined and conscientious.
Which of these
is most characteristic of you?
- Con-sci-en-tious.
- And which is least characteristic?
- Conscientious.
- I have to meet
one of your inspectors.
I don't mean to nun anyone.
She's a girl.
I saw her on the bus, once or twice,
and I'd like to meet her.
- I recommend a valid pass
before getting on the bus again.
Maybe it will work out.
- Yeah, I thought ofthat.
But isn't there a record?
Or something like that?
I know her number.
I saw it on that little ID.
It's 3082.
- Please write your ID number there.
- Sure.
I just thought, that with the number
I could find her somehow
and it would be
easier for me.
Thanks, anyway.
- The answer is on that paper.
- Really? That's fantastic, thanks.
One more thing, is there
a lost and found here?
I was about 7, when
I lost a red bear.
Would it be possible
to dig it up from somewhere?
- Maybe I'm the
first and last person
to walk out of the
Fine Settlement Office happy.
Everyone believes the bad stories
the good ones have to be
explained to death.
- It's hard to cope with the stress.
Maybe next week,
I'll take a few days off.
- My new breakfast shake:
Banana, orange, cinnamon,
honey, egg, poppy seeds and a bit of kiwi.
A real vitamin bomb.
- Nowadays, I smoke a cigarette
in bed before sleep.
Just like back in the dorm.
- I got this changing table
from my sister.
Any suppon is welcome now.
- I ran 5,3 kilometres.
Next week I'm going for 6.
- I feel a lot better
since I staned recycling.
- I washed the flag.
Strange. It was diny.
But now it's clean.
- Fradi couldn't win again last week.
Kaposvar-Fradi
1 :1 .
- I was thinking about hiring
a pianist for the weekend.
It would lift the mood.
- "The answer is on the paper."
For fuck's sake.
- You're leaving too? Why?
You're the founh friend
to leave in two months.
Sanyi left, too...
- To Amsterdam?
- Amsterdam, yeah, yeah.
- Pepe is gone.
- Pepe, too, yeah. Bozsi's in Greece.
- Pepe, he's making coffee in London,
how much would he make at home?
- I disagree.
Is it that much better abroad?
- Listen, what's good here?
- Hungarian girls are gorgeous.
- Not that again!
- But that's a fact.
- Turo rudi.
- That's Soviet candy.
I can't make a living.
My diplomas aren'twor1h shit.
- If you stan a company,
you go broke after the costs.
- The big Hungarians,
all went abroad, right?
- They honk and swear
when you're cycling.
- Hungarian films are shit.
- So are commercials!
- Why advenise?
There's no consumption.
- Everybody's unemployed.
- Transaction tax!
- Football?
- It's been shitty forever.
- Corruption. - A doctor making
as much as a sweeper.
- That fucking yellow tram.
- Everything to get ahead.
- Everybody complains.
- No electronic entry...
- Turn on the TV. Talk about
numbing the nation!
- And the young kids think
they are the example...
Eva Ink
GRASS IS GREEN, SKY IS BLUE,
WATER IS WET
- If I yell out "Eva lnk" on every square,
I have to find her...
There can't be many "Eva lnks".
Anyway, what kind of name is that?
- So, here are the folders.
This one's yours.
- Super.
- Sorry, I don't want to intrude.
It's not about money,
Just three questions,
it's a public survey.
- Go ahead.
- I'll name animals,
it'd be great if you could tell me
your opinion about them,
one word is enough,
but an explanation is better, okay?
- Sure.
- The first is the hedgehog.
- Cute animal.
My dad and I found one,
because he's a gardener.
- A company is looking for
an expressive animal for its image.
- The beaver is hard-working.
- Sorry, could you help me
with a survey?
Hedgehog?
- Wolverine? Only from
the X-Men comics.
- It has a very
attractive presence after all.
- My opinion of rabbits is
they're like...
- What about deers?
- Cute, likeable.
I recommend them.
- Very good.
- The deer is cute, but I've
heard nasty things about them.
- If there's one animal that
I can't bear, it's the rabbit.
I had a rabbit in my childhood.
Which I managed to put to death
in two days, because
as I later found out from an expert,
I fed it moist grass,
and it seems I shouldn't have...
- Goddamn you piece of shit cocksucker,
stan the fucking tram!
Fucking shitty life.
- Hi, Aron!
- "Good evening, dear parents".
- There's a couple of things.
- Aron dear, I cleaned today,
why are you still in your shoes?
- The point is, Eszter
and I broke up.
I didn't refund the ticket, because I'll
fly to Ponugal, Lisbon, alone.
- Wha-what?
I don't understand.
- When are you leaving?
- In a week.
- A week.
- And what do you want to do there?
- Nothing. - What?
- Nothing.
- You could do that here.
Why fly to Lisbon for that?
- If he wants to try
- What does he want to try?
- He's a young man.
- He couldn't get a job
here, it's impossible.
- Rimbaud...
Rimbaud was 17 when...
- Enough vi/ith the literary references,
this is about our child!
- He's a late bloomer, let him go.
- How easily you let
this little problem pass by!
- It's not that easy. - I had to write
his CV! He couldn't do it!
- Your mother wrote your CV?
Fuck me!
- Rimbaud wrote his own CV.
Or poems, at least.
- OK, let's agree. The kid goes
to Lisbon, or wherever.
If he fails, he comes back.
What's the big deal?
- Oh, your generous liberalism!
- But what's the problem?
A young person wants to try
his luck somewhere.
Let the kid live!
- Can't he do it at home?
- I'd like that too, but he has
no possibilities to...
- That's enough.
Turn it off.
We don't wash
in running water.
Green goes in the first,
the white in the second.
Not now, it's already done.
Take out the plate...
No need to dick around. Take it out,
scrub it, move it over.
And when you're done with the first,
then do the same for the next.
Then put them in the third to drip.
Mmm? Got it?
- Yeah.
- Great!
And which one?
The one with the polka-dots, okay.
Don't send it.
I believe you.
You're beautiful.
I love you. Kisses!
You're dicking around again.
Take it out, scrub it,
put it in the next.
That's what they call work.
WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?
MEET TONIGHT? - BALINT
GRASS IS GREEN, SKY IS BLUE,
WATER IS WET
- Okay, I only have one question.
It'll only take a minute, may I?
- Say it.
- There's a car, out here,
kind of square shaped,
with some nature stuff written on it,
like the colour of the sky
and waters are wet,
and that kind of stuff.
- Yeah.
- You know whose that is?
No? It's a girl's...
Uh, Eva, I think.
- Eva What?
- Ink... Ink...
- Eva Ink?
- You know her?
- No.
- No?
- So you live here?
- No, my grandfather does.
- Really? That's cool, you know, I guess
he walks around, has lots of friends,
he knows the old
ladies and gentlemen?
Could we ask him about her?
- My grandfather died.
- Sorry, could you turn
the music down a little?
Thank you so much.
Please continue.
Just tell me what happened.
It happened, right?
- Mostly nothing.
What do you mean?
I put my shoes on, then I left.
That was about it.
- You were in her room after
the wake, right? - I was...
- Do you get it?
Why you were there?
- No. - You don't.
It's very linear, listen.
Death: passing, sadness,
pain, funeral, got it?
Wake: we're still here,
want to live, sing and dance.
Go to the room.
Let's live, now.
- And fuck? Yeah, I get it.
- That's all it is!
- I'm not a dick!
And after a funeral! If she'd
wanted me, she'd said...
Hey, I like you.
Wanna screvxfl
- Nobody says that out loud!
- I do, for example.
- Communication is 99%
meta-communication, got it?
- So it's all being mysterious?
I can't do that.
- It's body language, how you move,
how you make eyes.
- Not for me. And making eyes?
What's that mean?
I don't even know what it means.
- It's a requirement.
- I've no clue.
- Fuck, Aron.
At the bar. Brown hair.
Talking with her girlfriend. See her?
- Kinda pretty.
- She's very pretty.
Stan watching her.
- I'm already doing it.
- Phase one: we watch.
- I'm doing it, don't know why.
- Watch, just watch.
That's it.
- For how long?
- Until eye contact.
- Well, she's contacting.
- So look back!
Don't look down!
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- Don't look at her now!
She's hooked.
- What?
- You don't fucking knovxfl
When the girl sees
that a guy likes her,
but the guy ignores her
and talks with his friends.
- That's a sneaky move.
You're teaching me tricks!
- It's pan of the game.
She knows, everyone knows.
You're doing great.
- Sure, I don't give a shit.
- We're just casually talking.
- Of course. I'm good...
good and fucked.
- The girl looked over twice.
- Really?
- And she tossed her hair.
Know what that means?
You're good to go!
- Really?
- Now we've arrived
at Phase Three.
- This is a pretty,
uh, nice place.
I just don't get the
plants in the hall.
- You don't get them?
- Are they yours or who's to blame?
Oh, here? Excuse me.
Be right back.
- Jesus.
- Everything okay?
- Uh, you...
is this sex?
- What?
- What the fuck.
I mean you, naked,
you took off your clothes.
Why would you do this?
I'm sorry, but I don't
know your name.
Maybe it's not imponant,
but I wouldn't mind knowing.
Like how old you are.
Fuck, you got bare-naked.
Maybe say something
about yourself?
Or show me your room?
Or something interesting?
Maybe then we could
fall in love,
what did you think?
I mean, that's a great body, and
I see shapes and smell smells.
I'm sweating, my dick is hard,
my body is reacting!
Is this your mom?
And you're OK with that?
Sure, let's entenain her,
awesome show.
It's just the cunain...
you need one.
I gotta go. Excuse me. Bye.
Unbelievable...
Is this how it is?
- Hello.
- Hi, Aron, I'm almost there.
- Where?
- Well, at your place.
- What for?
- I bought a fewthings for your trip,
and now we can pack them.
Your father's coming, too.
Aron?
- Eva Ink!
- Hi.
This looks like an attack,
but it really isn't.
I'll blun out a fewthings now,
and you decide if I'm still a nice guy.
My name is Aron.
And you're the ticket inspector girl.
To me, what you do is fantastic.
Your work and everything.
We meet occasionally,
do you feel like having
a cream pastry with me?
Maybe a cream puff,
if not, I understand that, too.
Maybe we could go to lkea.
Buy bamboo, or maybe a hotdog,
or hide in the kids' tent. You could
get a laundry basket and I'd ask:
'Why do you need that?'
and you'd say, 'For my laundry!',
and I'd say,
'Okay, I get it.'
That night we could snuggle
and you'd pull the cunains.
That would be great, I think.
Next morning, you'd stan sipping
from my grandma's cup, you know
I really like that cup,
but I'd be touched...
by how you sip tea from it.
Then we'd see a movie...
Some horror film. You're scared
but you'd snuggle,
So I feel like, I'm finally a guy...
, sorFV-
I have to go.
Really, I'm sorry.
- This feels like it.
I'm going to...
Fuck me.
- I put out all the things
you'll need.
I'm not packing this.
This you should wear, I think.
Look at the nice blue towel.
I put in two long-sleeves.
Who knows what
the weather will be like.
- One is enough.
- Excuse me?
- Just one of each.
He doesn't need two.
- You know what? Go have a smoke.
We'll take care of it.
- Yeah, that's the best.
- Just wait for us.
We still have to get canned food,
and some sausages.
He needs something to
eat on the first days.
Underwear. I threwthe rest out.
They were used and diny.
I put these in here for you.
That's not too many.
This black shin has to go in.
It'll look great.
- Wait. Stop!
- What's wrong?
- What's this? This?
- Those are good for dust rags.
- A rag? My favourite shin?
No, no.
- You didn't notice the holes.
- Of course, I did!
That's why it's my favourite!
I got it from Eszter.
- Sorry, I didn't know.
But you look like a hobo in it.
Try to dress decent abroad.
- That's the first thing I'll wear!
- Why do you say that?
I try to help you...
- You think I should wear this?
I'd rather look homeless.
Look!
- It's brand new.
You could try it on...
- You want me to look like
a clown in an office?
This is howl look. I'm tattered.
Rags are fashionable, got it?
I'll be a tattered, filthy,
loser, proud Hungarian peasant.
Because that's what I am.
- Great speech.
- What's this?
- I bought a notebook
so you can write.
You can throw it
out if you want.
- It's a nice notebook.
Thank you.
- Strange howthey told me
about the pany in the last minute.
Maybe it's a secret,
surprise farewell pany?
Weird, I usually don't
catch the tram.
Maybe Miki didn't let
them close the doors?
And what if Roland
is driving the tram?
All these people are extras?
Miki got them for me?
And the cars? Balint's got
some car dealer friend.
Maybe he pulled a favor,
filled the city with cars,
and Tomi is directing it all.
And Roland isn't driving
just one tram...
he's directing all the trams, buses,
metros, cars in the whole city!
But wait a sec.
Roland can't speak.
- By the way, we were... listen!
- Yep?
- We were supposed to go
to Gyongy. But it was full.
Then we went to another place,
but it wasn't too good.
Then Akos called about this pany.
I thought it's not a dumb idea.
- Forget it. Doesn't matter.
Really, no problem.
, sorFV-
GOT AN IDEA.
LET'S MEET AT SZONDI - MIKI
- Gentlemen.
Pass these around.
Onions, no onions?
- Onions.
- Decide for yourselves.
This is mine.
When is he coming?
- What? Who?
- Aron doesn't knovxfl
- No.
- What?
- David Amigo.
- David Amigo?
- Comes here every Wednesday.
- That's fucking ace. I'm gone.
- No, you're not!
That's why we came. You're staying.
We'll wait for him.
- Time to be a man
and go through with this.
- That's him.
- Fuck, that's really him!
- Him?
- Now what? I walk over there
and kick his ass?
- Depends on
what you want, Aron.
- I'll be quick, I don't
want to waste time.
- I know you.
From school.
- Yeah, but that's not...
- Hi!
- I just wanted to say...
- How about a shot?
I'm drinking one. Two Unicums.
What did I do?
- You fucked me up in school,
and I came hereto say
that I think you're...
You're a piece of shit.
Maybe you're a better man since
but I think you're a scumbag.
- I beat you up?
- You did.
- I wasn't the bully type.
- Well, but...
- When did I beat you up?
- It doesn't matter.
You humiliated me,
in front of Vivien
and my friends. - Vivien?
- Vivien Csatlos, you know...
You don't remember her either?
- She was my girl, but...
...are you sure I beat you up?
- Absolutely.
You're David Amigo, aren't you?
- David Amigo.
Yeah, that was me.
- So, that fits...
- Now I'm Peach.
- You changed it?
- No, just...
I spilled peach juice on me.
They all call me that.
My colleagues...
I teach in high school.
Doesn't matter,
it's stupid.
Yesterday, one kid asks
me in front of the class:
'Who the fuck cares
where iron ore is?'
I wrote him up
for swearing.
Geography, fuck.
When you decide to be a teacher,
you believe you'll
pass on knowledge...
lt'simpor1ant, it's something.
Then you go in and
you know what's in their eyes?
Fucking nothing, the big emptiness.
'What's fucking geography?'
Who cares about the types of hills?
Even I think there's no fucking difference!
You think it's a beautiful subject...
but nobody cares,
not even me.
'Who gives a fuck about iron ore?'
And I froze, I couldn't tell him!
Because...
Does it fucking matter at all?
Hungary has to impon
everything anyway!
But you know what, Aron?
Slap me.
- What?
- Slap me.
Or you can kick me.
Which do you want?
- I'll hit, just...
- Okay, slap me.
- Novxfl
- Yeah.
- Okay, it's coming.
- I'm ready.
- Thanks, I gotta go.
"If I could stan
this life over again
I wouldn't waste
the years like this
I'd find at last,
what I'm dreaming of,
this would be wonh it all,
because I'm searching
even more.
Where is happiness,
how long must I yet wait?
Happiness,
my hean burns for it.
Say, where has it gone?
Nobody knows.
Happiness,
my hean burns for it.
Say, where has it go..."
- Hi, I'll be down in a sec.
- I don't really understand...
- She's Maria.
She was kind.
She brought a dictionary.
Although it didn't bother me that
we didn't understand each other.
- Um, 'horse dick in your ass'.
- Horse... dick.
- Horse dick.
- Horse dick.
- Horse dick.
- Maria got me a betterjob.
My only problem was
I had to wear a shin.
- Kiss, kiss, bye.
- I don't speak Hungarian.
Budapest!
- Horse dick in your ass.
- I know it's weird.
But it simply...
went away.
- One morning I left
the office key at home...
As I was running...
I suddenly realized,
I might as well
run home.
Then I decided
to come back home.
- And this blog is the one
with the photos of plates,
with the pictures in grease?
- You've seen it?
- Yeah, it's really funny.
We saw it last week, really cool.
- I'm glad.
- So weird that you
drink coffee now.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, it's not...
It's strange compared to Lisbon.
But you can get used to it.
Look, here's one of your hairs.
- They're everywhere.
- So, you, in general,
how are you doing?
- Well, me. I'm fine.
I changed jobs and now
I work at a multinational company.
The work itself
isn't interesting, at all.
In fact, it's shit.
But I like it.
- Aron!
Are you listening?
- It came out.
- What?
A lemon between my teeth,
I was struggling with it,
but, I'm good.
- But it came out.
- Yeah, it did.
- Let's see... What
day is it exactly?
Sunday?
Yeah. So tomorrow is Monday.
Tomorrow I stan writing my book.
And what year is it?
Honestly, it doesn't matter.
For Some lnexplicable Reason
