Six months ago,
we lost a beloved member

You never got

How'd you put it?
"S... smart and kind

Come here, you two.
Come on.
Come on.
Sarah,
Lester is as selfless a person
as I have ever known.
He's gonna take
good care of you.
And Lester,
I know how hard it's been
on you losing Jessica.
But we all saw how devoted
Sarah was to Edie.
