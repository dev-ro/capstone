PELLET
One,
two, three.
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen...
You re a cheater.
-You left too soon.
-You're the cheater.
And you suck.
Say it to my face.
Go on.
Hi, Dad.
Dad...
Grab the bag outside.
-Where?
-Under the counter.
This one?
Yes.
What is it?
It's for your mom.
Come on, let's go.
See you later.
Get a haircut later.
But make sure they cut it.
Ask your mom for money.
-You got that?
-Yes.
Who cut it,
-Juanjo or Vidal?
-Vidal. Juanjo wasn t there.
Next time wait
for Juanjo. He s better.
It's too short.
Again, Grandma?
What's wrong?
She pissed again,
that's what.
-Then clean it up.
-I wasn t going to leave it.
-Come on, get up Grandma.
-Sorry, I didn t realize.
Then ask me.
I can t spend all day with you.
Come on.
-The floor's a mess.
-It's all right.
And she has to be changed or else
everything will stink.
My Lord!
You should have told me.
Come on, take off
your sweater first.
Stop playing with
that thing and eat.
I am eating.
Get rid of it or I will.
Hey, nice haircut!
Watch it.
-It wasn't me.
-Yeah, sure.
What a shithead!
Hi.
Carlos, do you have a moment?
Easy, kids.
Lower your voices.
Calm down.
This is Alfredo,
our new student.
Hi, Alfredo.
Come with me.
Have a seat in front.
Okay, let s continue.
Lolo.
Pass it on.
It s not from me.
Can you see him?
He's not coming.
-Is that true about India?
-I don't know.
Bucktooth said it's from India.
-Bucktooth is an asshole.
-Nice tits.
Go on, pass it on.
That one's old.
There he is.
What's he doing?
What a dipshit.
What's going on?
They caught that fool.
You're the fool.
Hi.
Hi.
-What do you want?
-Who, me? Nothing.
You're following me.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
What is it?
I just wanted to talk to you.
What s your name?
Pablo, but everyone calls me
' Pellet '.
-What did the bear say?
-What bear?
The teacher who caught you smoking.
That I couldn't smoke at school.
-What did you say?
-Nothing. I put it out.
-Did you write the note?
-No.
Who was it?
You don't have to say.
Cobeta.
-Who s that?
-A kid who sits behind you.
Friend of yours?
No.
I have no friends.
I've got these, and those.
Anything bigger won t fit.
I II be right with you.
These are fine.
Go help Mrs. Encarna.
Then give me... Let's see...
Three... Give me ten.
How are you, Pablito?
Hi, Encarna.
Do you have this kind
of light bulb?
Dad, where are the smaller
-light bulbs?
-Second shelf on the left.
Bye.
How's your back, Mrs. Encarna?
As bad as ever.
Seen a doctor?
What can he do?
Tons of good for nothing
medication.
-Age is the problem.
-You're in better shape than most.
-What do I owe you?
-300.
I'm sick of it, Mariano.
If we were Pablito's age
we'd be fine.
I bet you don t
have any back problems.
You see?
Bye.
How's school?
Fine.
Fine?
Nothing new?
-What was going to happen?
-You never talk about it...
So there's no news?
You mean the new kid?
-What new kid?
-A new kid came today.
Really? How was it?
What's he like?
I don t know,
I didn't talk to him.
-Hi, Ramon.
-Hi, Mariano.
-Look at me when I talk to you.
-I didn't do anything.
Especially in public, got it?
-Who is it?
-It's me, Sebas.
-Hi.
-Hi.
You coming out?
Where are you going?
The fair and the tracks.
-What time?
-7, 7:30
at Moor Park.
-You going?
-Yeah.
Fox owes me money.
He said he'd pay today.
I mean to the tracks.
Only if you do.
-I'm not going.
-Cobeta is.
-Pablo!
-What?
Don't stand in the doorway!
Right, I have to go.
You're not coming?
I can't. Don't tell
Cobeta you saw me.
Okay. I'm off.
See you later.
-Hey, Sebas.
-What?
-You know where the new kid lives?
-In the new towers. Why?
No reason. See you later.
The ones with the round windows.
Look like a boat.
Hey, shithead!
Either come in or leave!
But close the door!
It was only one second!
I've told you to never
talk back to me!
Okay, you can help.
Hand me the pliers.
-These?
-No, those are tongs.
The pliers have a red handle.
-These?
-Yes. Hand them over.
I'll get it.
Careful not to fall.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Who are you?
Pellet. And you?
I'm Juan.
Come in.
Who is it?
Who is it, Juan?
Hello.
Hi.
-Is Alfredo here?
-You're not my brother s friend.
Of course he is.
I never saw him with Alfre.
That doesn't mean
they're not friends.
Look, go down
to the end of the hall.
First room on the left.
Got a taboo?
What?
-Got a taboo?
-He means tattoo.
No.
Mommy's got one on her ass.
Great.
Tell him all my secrets.
Let him go, he's here
to see your brother, not you.
See you, Pellet.
See you. Bye.
Bye.
-What did you call him?
-Pellet.
' Pellet" isn t a name.
He must have said "Juan",
or ' Pedro' , or "Alfonso '...
-He said 'Pellet".
-Fine, I believe you.
Yes?
-Hi.
-Hi. Come on in.
Don't worry, he won t bite.
Have a seat.
-How did you know where I live?
-Sebas told me.
-How did he know?
-Someone must have told him.
Very cool.
What is?
Your room, and the flat.
Very cool.
What's up?
Nothing.
You want to hang out?
Where?
Some of the guys are at the fair.
Who?
Kids from class.
And the area.
Cobeta's there.
That's not what I meant.
-Are you going?
-I don't know.
The fair sucks. I went last year
and there was nothing.
Let's hit the amusement park.
I'm broke.
I know a guy at the door.
If he's there we can get in free.
I don't know...
Come on.
Coming or not?
The fair is a drag.
Who s that?
-Who?
-In the picture.
My old man.
Hey, Birras.
Come on in.
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your pal?
Yeah. Pellet, this is Birras.
Birras, Pellet.
What's up, kid?
What?
Are you here to see me?
Or...
To see you.
And maybe you could let us in.
And kill two birds with one stone.
You're a smart little brat.
A couple stick-ons,
and 2 tickets for
the "Launch Pad' .
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
You came to see me?
Well, you've seen me.
Give me a kiss.
And tell your pop
to stop by sometime.
Hurry up, already.
We close at nine.
-See you later.
-Bye.
-Birras.
-What?
-Got a smoke for me?
-A smoke!
You little devil.
Here. Now beat it
before I change my mind.
Ever been on this?
Yeah.
-How was it?
-You'll shit your pants.
-I don't think so.
-You II see.
-You don t scare me.
-You're already scared.
You're the one shitting himself.
You always carry that pellet
with you?
Not a pellet, a ball-bearing.
It brings me good luck.
I don't believe in that bullshit.
But hold on to it tight.
We don't want it to fall now.
You're shitting.
What if it broke right now?
If it broke right now,
we'd be totally screwed.
Son of a bitch.
Relax.
It's all right.
Hey, are you a screamer?
-No. Are you?
-Me? No way.
-Ever seen anyone get a tattoo?
-No.
Well, once on a TV show.
It must hurt like hell.
It depends where.
Sensitive areas hurt, like
your ankle, shin or knee...
Where the skin s close
to the bone.
-lf there's no bone it doesn t hurt?
-Much less.
What's so funny?
There's no bone in my dick
but I bet it hurts like hell!
What a ride!
-It'd be cool to go to India.
-Sure.
But I'd rather go to Africa.
It must be amazing.
-Where would you go?
-To the desert.
What for?
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.
You can treat next time.
If it weren't for this,
I'd be puking still.
Why didn't you tell me
you get dizzy, you dickhead?
I was embarrassed.
You should have told me.
-That hit the spot.
-Sure did.
What do we do now?
Digest our food first.
-Where do we go first?
-Your choice.
I don't care.
But not Corkscrew.
The ferris wheel.
-What for?
-I'm joking, dipshit.
You're crazy, man!
I m going to fall!
Relax, Grandma.
I've got you.
Stay still.
She's digging her nails into me!
Don t make this worse.
Raise your arm.
Raise your arm!
Don't shout.
Why are you shouting?
I'm not.
-Yes you are!
-Fine, whatever you say.
Turn around.
In front of the child.
How embarrassing!
I'm not looking, Grandma.
If you'd cooperate
he wouldn't have to be here.
I wash myself everyday.
You wash your face,
that's not enough.
I wash more than my face.
I don't want to argue.
See you later.
Where are you going?
To hang out.
It's the anniversary of your
brother's death.
You want me to stay?
No, go on.
Go hang out.
That's all you do,
hang out
in the fucking street.
Let him go.
It wouldn't kill him
to stay home for once.
I'd say.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-I thought you weren't coming.
-I got tied up.
-Why are you dressed like that?
-No reason.
It's only my dad's studio.
That's not why.
-Come on, let's go.
-Is it far?
The studio?
Yeah.
6 metro stops.
Come on.
What an outfit.
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.
-What's up, monster?
-Hi.
Why are you here?
I came to see you.
I can see that.
Did you tell your mom?
Yeah.
He didn't tell her.
That wasn t very convincing.
Ever seen this before?
No.
Here's the design.
-Is the dragon finished?
-You can't see it now.
-Just let Pellet see it.
-No, Alfredo.
Go on, let him see it.
Hey, you faggot.
I'm on my way over.
No, he can't.
No, he said he had stuff to do.
The other one s for you?
Thanks.
This one's mine?
Yeah.
Alfredo says he wants to come
to the studio sometime.
You've got some nerve.
Skipping school,
dropping by without notice,
and next the recording studio.
You live like a king.
You've got some nerve.
You always tell me to enjoy life.
Yeah, but not so much.
And you're pushing it.
Alfonso, are you free later?
You're not going home?
No. But you can take
the metro, right?
Or do you need a chauffeur?
-Where are you going?
-To see Felix
at the hospital.
So are you free?
No way.
Come on.
Come with me.
No.
-Why not?
-No.
He s okay.
He's fine.
So was Hendrix and
he didn't even recognize me.
I just talked to him.
He asked
about you.
No, Jose.
-I don't get you.
-You don't?
It's simple.
I m tired of seeing
my friends die.
I've spent
3 years burying my friends.
I don't want to see Felix like that.
I don't want to remember him
that way.
Dad, can I come with you?
No, I ve told you a hundred times.
You can't.
Why not?
Don't make me say it again!
Who's Felix?
My godfather.
What's wrong with him?
He has Aids.
-That's why your pop won t let you?
-Yeah.
I want to see him, though.
I II go tomorrow at playtime.
They won't let you in.
I don't care.
I'll sneak in.
Hey.
-What?
-Come with me.
I can't miss class.
Next weekend if you want.
No, I m going tomorrow.
Come and meet him.
He's cool, and he'll like you.
I can't.
I would if I could, I swear.
How will you get out?
Through the front door,
how do you think?
The door's locked.
I know a better way.
Pellet!
-What?
-Thanks.
You're welcome.
Hey, why don't you come with me?
Come on.
-I can't.
-You re a shithead.
I II see you tomorrow.
See you.
Pellet.
-The tracks tomorrow.
-Fine.
What's up?
-Ditching again tomorrow?
-Fuck you, Cobeta.
You're scared.
Forget it, punk!
Why did you come?
I didn't want you to go alone.
I knew you'd come.
-How?
-I don t know, but I knew.
Hi.
Hi.
-We're here to see a patient.
-Room number?
-210.
-One second.
There's no answer.
Is he
expecting you?
No.
You can't
enter without an adult.
Sorry.
-Is he a relative?
-My godfather.
Is he alone?
I don't think so.
Wait over there
if you want and
I'll try again, okay?
Okay.
What a crock.
What do we do?
I don t know. Let's wait.
What if your godmother comes?
I m not leaving till I see him.
With her there,
it might be difficult.
Felix?
Alfredo.
Alfredo!
Come on, man. Let's go.
Come on, man.
That son of a bitch!
-Will you tell your pop you saw him?
-No.
I shouldn't have gone.
Why not?
Because.
I understand Alfonso now.
If you hadn t, it would have
bugged you your whole life.
Why'd they shave his head?
I don t know.
How can they keep someone
like that alive?
I d rather die
than be like that. I'd shoot myself.
They wouldn t leave me
half-dead. And if I die,
they can burn my body
and throw the ashes
into the sea or anywhere
as long as it isn't one
of those sick tombs.
Big deal.
If you're already dead, who cares?
I care. I won't be put
in a hole.
I don't want to die.
Of course not! Neither do I.
But it's impossible.
Why?
Because everyone dies.
-I don't see why.
-How should I know?
It's up to God or whatever.
God doesn't exist.
How do you know?
I just do.
God doesn't exist
and I'm never going to die.
Or let Him stop this rock
from landing on that light
reflected in the water.
No fucking way.
No?
Get your ass in here, asshole!
Fucking move!
I'm going to kick your ass!
What do you mean, ' nothing '?
The next time you ditch class
you're fucking dead!
What s E.T. s dad s name?
-What?
-Eat Me!
How stupid.
You in, Lolo?
I'm out.
New kid?
If not, what did you come for?
I can t be here?
Sure. You can watch.
I'm not watching you.
-What?
-You heard me.
Yeah, you d better not.
Leave him alone.
I just hate smart asses.
Okay, come on.
Let's draw for it.
Adri.
You in or what?
Let s go, shit.
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...
Sebas against...
He always cheats!
See how he went before the signal?
I didn't see it.
You II see when you go against him.
He s a real son of a bitch.
I won't because I'll never do it.
It s fucking stupid.
-What is?
-That fucking stupid game.
No way, it s real cool.
I don't see why.
It is, it's amazing.
Yeah, especially the day someone gets
their head ripped off by the train.
-Like the tall guy.
-What tall guy?
Last year a tall kid got killed.
What's up?
He's not coming.
Shit. One less.
Why not?
-His father says he s grounded.
-Why?
What for?
I don t know.
What now?
Go try to talk to him.
You go, Alfonso.
I don't even know him.
Shit.
You know his name?
No.
All right, fine.
Be right back.
Jose,
be diplomatic.
And cover the tattoo.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Pablo lives here, right?
-Yes.
I'm Alfredo's father.
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Could I speak to your husband?
-Of course.
Come in.
Good morning.
How's it going?
-Hi, Pablo.
-Hi.
He's the father of the boy
who was here earlier.
Forgive the intrusion.
No, not at all.
What is it?
-Won't you sit down?
-No, thank you.
We re all going up to a house
on the mountain, and thought
Pablo could join us.
Right.
-You'll be back today?
-Yeah.
We II be back
at around 10 or 11.
It depends on the traffic,
you know how it is on weekends.
You want to go?
I have to do what
you said.
You can do that tomorrow.
Go on.
Thanks. See you later.
Bye.
Who farted?
It stinks!
You pig, you farted.
It was you,
-don t lie.
-It was you.
Yeah, he s the pig.
-Open my window.
-Mine, too.
It s no big deal.
There they are.
Mommy, Alfonso fartied.
Yes, he did.
And it stinks.
Hop in.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi, Pablo.
-Get off me, Golfo.
Where are we going?
To the top.
To the clouds?
Maybe not as high as the clouds.
To the sky?
Hey, what's the hurry?
Be careful.
Let them go, give them a break.
So, when are we going to stop?
Stop?
Didn't you say
we'd stop soon?
Go on, your turn.
Do it with him.
Let's see.
Where is it?
Don't...
Golfo!
Golfo!
Okay, we're in.
-Dad...
-What?
-I'm soaked.
-Don't worry about it.
Here, take the kid.
Up, Golfo.
Up.
It came from nowhere.
I'm drenched!
So am I.
That's what you get
for not bringing clothes.
It's a great feeling.
Nice and wet.
Especially my nuts.
Warm and soggy!
Here. This is for you
and this is for your friend.
Leave your wet shoes
and clothes
in the tub.
Okay.
It s big, but it's all we have.
I'll dry your clothes later.
Hey.
Don't drip too much.
We won't. Bye.
Bye.
Shit, I'm freezing, man!
Me, too!
Take the boots.
Shit.
It's big on you.
'Big", he says.
-Where's mine?
-In the basket.
It's in there.
Grab it.
How did that happen?
What?
Your back.
I fell the other day.
Well?
I'm washing my hands.
I don't want you with
those people again.
Why not?
Because I said so.
Okay, okay.
Dry off and go to bed,
it's after eleven.
Son of a bitch.
I hope you die.
Hey, you guys seen Pellet?
-You seen him, Red?
-No.
Maybe he s in the shop.
Salva?
-You seen him?
-Nope.
He's probably sick.
For a week?
Why not?
His dad probably beat him up.
Yeah? How do you know?
Cause I do.
Did he tell you?
No, but everyone knows it.
You ve got a big mouth.
Why do you say that?
Because you do.
Big-mouth.
Pablo, it s me. Open up.
I can't.
Why not?
Because. Please go away,
my dad will be here any minute.
-How are you?
-Fine.
You sure?
Yeah.
Then let me in.
I told you, I can't.
Just for a second.
I can't.
Please leave and don't come back.
Leave or I'll be in trouble again.
He hit you?
Your old man hit you, right?
Pablo?
Are you there?
Just tell me if he did.
I II leave. I swear.
-Can I give Golfo some dinner?
-No, you can't feed the dog.
When you gone
I give him.
Fine, but hold off until I leave.
Okay, squirt?
I'm not a squirt.
What s wrong with you?
Me? Nothing.
Come on, I know you.
What's wrong?
Have a bite.
Nothing.
You haven't said a word
all night.
What is it?
It's not me, it's Pellet.
What about him?
Golfo!
Another?
He's missed class all week.
And?
Remember that day on the mountain?
When we were changing
our wet clothes
I saw his back
and it was full of marks
and bruises.
I asked him
and he said he'd fell,
but he lied.
What do you mean?
It was his dad.
How do you know?
Everyone knows about it.
Hello.
Remember me?
-I'm...
-Sure.
Of course I do.
It s about your son.
Is there a problem?
No, no.
Well?
He's been missing class.
I thought he might be sick.
My son's been looking for him
for days.
It's probably nothing...
He's at his grandma's
with tonsillitis.
Right.
Then forget it.
Tell him Alfredo said hi.
Who?
My son, Alfredo.
Right. I'll tell him.
-Thanks. And excuse me.
-It's nothing.
See you later.
Good bye.
Pablo?
Pablo!
Pablo, wait.
How did that happen?
Pellet, wait.
-You going home?
-Yeah.
-Where were you at recess?
-In the yard.
I didn t see you.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I don t know.
My dad said we could go
to the studio.
He s doing Ramiro.
I can't.
-Why not?
-I just can't. Bye.
-Where were the marks?
-On his back.
And his ribs.
Just bruises, or also scars?
I think he had scars, too.
How did he explain them?
He fell.
You re sure?
Everyone knows his dad hits him.
And I saw more on him yesterday.
None of it matters
if we can't prove it.
You saw his dad hit him?
No.
That's what matters.
-Did he say why he can't come?
-No.
Get him
to talk to Laura.
I'll talk to a social worker
to see
what we can do.
And meanwhile?
There's nothing else we can do.
Unless you want to press charges.
I wouldn't unless
I were completely sure.
Wait.
For what?
For it to happen again?
For him to speak.
The kid has to admit it.
Hello?
Hi.
Right.
He's here, don't call him.
When?
No, we ended up leaving later.
Yeah, I know where it is.
Tomorrow at five. All right.
Good bye.
Alfredo, come here a second.
-Come here.
-What is it?
Come here.
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
Felix is dead.
It's all right.
It's all right.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see Alfredo.
Where is he?
Next door. Come on.
Did you call your mom?
Hi.
-How are you?
-Okay.
Did you see your godmother?
Yeah, she's pretty sad.
Well, cheer up
or she'll cry when she sees you.
You want anything?
I just had a coke.
-Pablo?
-No, thanks.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
Anyone?
Coffee for me.
-Okay.
-Sit down.
Hi.
Hi.
-How did you find out?
-I heard at school.
When s the burial?
They're cremating him.
Good. They buried my brother
and it sucked.
I didn't know you'd lost a brother.
Remember the day
at the studio?
I'd just come from the cemetery.
I'm sorry.
Why?
About your brother.
I only lost a godfather
and look at me.
I never knew him.
He died before I was born.
Aren t you still sad?
No. He was probably an asshole.
Why do you say that?
Because. My father always
compares him with me.
He must have been an asshole.
How did he die?
In a car accident.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
-He moved.
-Don't fucking move!
Come on, shut up already.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
Me against...
You!
Hey! I'm talking to you!
What?
Are you in or out?
Leave me alone already.
-That kid's weird, man.
-Yeah.
A fag, like his godfather.
What did you say?
-I didn't say anything.
-I heard you!
I said you don't have
balls for this.
I just think it's fucking stupid.
Sure.
-You want to try me?
-lf you're up for it!
Relax, I won't do anything.
Cars 204 and 206,
are you there? Over.
204 here. Over.
Some kids have been spotted
on the tracks.
We're on our way.
What are you doing?
You should have gotten ran over.
What happened?
I told him he s an asshole.
-Why didn t you cross?
-I didn't want to.
I m never coming back here.
This sucks.
-Where are you going?
-Home. You coming?
Sure.
Pellet! Wait!
I'm coming with you.
Hey, kids!
Stop there.
-Where are you going?
-Home.
Come on, get up.
-What's the hurry?
-Let me see.
What is it?
Your knee?
So what s this train thing?
A game.
A game? No, shit.
Pretty dangerous game.
I've never played.
What?
I don t play.
You're too smart, right?
You just sit there
waiting for one of your friends
to get run over.
They're all stupid
and you're the smart one.
I didn't say that.
Look.
I don't intend to be watching.
Alfredo, don't laugh.
I m serious!
You're getting on my nerves.
You hear me?
Do you hear me?
Yes.
I'm not going to follow you around
whenever you go out, I'm not a cop.
But I'll tell you one thing.
If you get killed
on those tracks,
you'll kill me and everyone else
who loves you.
Do you get it?
Do it for yourself.
Life has too much to offer.
Don't get yourself killed
before your time comes.
Life's already way too short.
Don't pout.
I'm telling you because I love you.
What a speech.
Bullshit.
You II just blow it off,
like we all did at your age.
That goes for you, too.
I m talking to you as a son.
I m not going back.
What?
I won t play again,
it's stupid.
Son of a bitch.
What a couple of smart little
assholes.
There's no room.
There isn't a free spot anywhere.
It's full. But look.
This is so cool.
It's not colorful, but...
-And this one?
-Much better.
It's the same but a profile.
It's beautiful.
Javier.
What are you up to now?
Nothing. Heading home.
I need some help.
Could you stay a little longer?
Sure.
Set up the chair.
Alfredo, Pablo, come here.
Sit here, Pablo.
Take that off.
-What for?
-Take it off.
Ready?
Wait.
Hold still.
Let me see it.
-See you later.
-Bye.
Mom...
Why are you so late?
-Where's Grandma?
-She went to bed.
Sit down.
Can't you ever be on time?
I got tied up.
Right.
-What's this?
-It's food, that's what.
Go on, eat.
Where have you been?
What do you mean?
Don't pull that shit with me,
I'm not one
of your little friends.
Where have you been?
At school, where else?
Where?
At school, I said.
You're lying!
I'm not lying, I was at school.
I went by.
Where were you?
I asked you a question.
I skipped the last class.
Skipped the last class?
Then where were you?
Answer me.
Are you deaf?
I said answer!
Don't hit him, please.
You stay out of this.
I m waiting.
Did you hear me?
I was at the tracks.
Really?
What the fuck were you doing?
-Nothing.
-Nothing?
Are you lying again? You want me
to tell you where you were?
Do I have to?
Where are you going?
Did I say get up?
Sit down!
Next time I see you with those
people I'll rip your head off!
Sit down!
You hear me?
Answer me!
Answer me!
-Answer me, you son of a bitch!
-Yes.
What was that?
What did you say?
Speak up!
Don't start, please...
Speak up!
You son of a bitch!
I hope you die!
Let him go.
Please don t hit him.
-Let go of me!
-Please, Mariano, please...
Stay the fuck out of this!
You spit on me?
On your father?
You're fucking dead!
You fucking spit on your father?
Stand up. Get up.
Manolo, open the door!
Open up!
He'll kill him!
Where are you going?
Come back here!
You going to cry now?
Come out of there.
Get the fuck
out of there, asshole!
Come out, you fucker!
I said come out here!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you going?
Mariano, let go of him!
Calm down.
Are you crazy?
Pablo! Where are you going?
Wait!
See if he spits on me now.
Calm down.
Pablo...
Pablo!
Pablo, come back!
Where are you going?
Come back!
That son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!
I hope you die, you son of a bitch.
Leave me alone. My son...
-We're about to eat.
-Just one piece of chorizo.
You'll get fat.
Very funny.
-You want chocolate?
-Yes.
You have to finish your plate.
Okay.
I'll get it!
-Okay, but then you'll eat.
-Okay.
Who is it?
Pablo!
-Alfre, is Pablo good?
-Of course he is.
-Then why does his daddy hit him?
-I don't know.
Laura? It's me again.
Call me when you get the message.
No matter how late.
Call me back.
It's about Alfredo s friend.
Still no answer.
-You want a drink?
-No, thanks.
You sure?
I want a coke.
I didn t ask you,
I asked your brother.
What will we do now?
I don't know, we II see.
See what your dad says.
-Does it hurt?
-A little.
Jose.
What?
Can I stay with you tonight?
Sure, don't worry about it.
I don't want to see my dad.
Don't think about that.
Size 5.0 stitches.
-And a tetanus shot?
-Yes.
You promise?
Relax, it II be fine.
Promise me.
I promise. Now try and relax.
We'll talk later.
Lie down, please.
Take off the gauze.
This'll hurt a little.
Don't move.
Hold his wrists,
please.
What s your name?
Pablo.
Can I have your hand?
Hang in there.
Hold still...
Are you dizzy?
What if that asshole
beats him up again tonight?
Can you be sure he won't?
I'm not sure of anything.
What I'm saying
is how things should be done.
If my idea sounds stupid to you,
I II leave
it all up to you.
How is he?
Fine. He wants water.
-Tell us if you need anything.
-Okay.
He clearly doesn't want
to go home.
Jose, it s not up to him.
We have to call his parents
and tell them he's here.
-Why?
-Because we do, shit.
The police could be
looking for him.
We can't hide him here.
I'm not hiding anyone.
Jose,
you've had a minor since 10 P.M.
It's 2 A.M. and you haven't
called his parents.
If you don't by tomorrow,
they could charge you
for kidnapping.
That's right.
And that dickhead father
could say the kid
left home unharmed.
Then we d be screwed.
Isn t there anything else
we can do?
Here.
Thanks.
My dad gave it to me.
You dropped it in the hospital.
Does it hurt?
A little.
And you?
Me what?
The tattoo.
Not anymore.
What did your dad say?
He s talking to Laura.
Well?
They're going to call your dad
to come pick you up.
Why?
Laura says it's for the best.
Or there could be trouble.
Your dad said I could stay here
tonight.
He promised.
Maybe Laura's right
and you should leave.
He promised.
He wanted you to stay.
My dad will kill me.
I swear.
He'll kill me.
It's Pablo's father.
Good evening. Come in.
Pellet!
Pellet!
Meet me in the alley
next to the park!
Where s Pablo?
Son of a bitch.
Got a light?
No.
Jos,,
you got a light?
Here.
Here.
Thank you.
You want one?
No, thanks. I don't smoke.
He's not here.
Where's that park
you hang out at?
He might be there.
Moor Park?
-I don t know. Where you guys meet.
-Moor Park.
Where is it?
Next to the church.
Let's go have a look.
You better stay.
If he sees you,
it could make things worse.
He's not here.
Wait, Alfredo.
What?
Where is he?
-What?
-Where's Pablo?
I don t know.
Yes, you do. Tell me.
I don't, I swear.
Don t lie to me.
I'm not lying.
Where is he? And don't say
you don t know. You can't fool me.
I can't say.
What?
I can't.
You'll let his dad take him.
I have to.
You said he'd stay with us.
I know, but things have changed.
Now he can t.
Because you don't want him to.
No, he just can't.
You II understand someday.
I can't explain it now.
Tell me.
Alfredo, tell me where he is.
No.
You're making this hard.
Don't make me say it again.
Don't make me do something
I'll regret.
Tell me.
-Are you going to tell me?
-No.
Now tell me where the fuck he is.
I don t know.
There he is.
Pablo, wait.
Is my dad there?
What?
Is he there?
Yes, but...
Pablo!
Pablo!
Pablo, stop!
Pablo, wait!
Pablo, stop!
I won't hurt you.
I won't.
-What?
-I won t go back with him.
Relax, you don't have to.
Come on.
That s it, take it easy.
Dad.
Alfredo.
Stay with him.
Cover up.
Cover up.
I'll be right back.
Laura, come here.
Nothing, just come here.
What's up?
I'm taking the kid home with me.
-Don't do it...
-Wait, listen.
Get rid of his father.
Tell him anything.
Jose, Jose.
You could get into trouble.
You know that, right?
I'm not thinking of myself.
I m thinking about the kid.
Come on, let's go.
Pablo, stand up.
My leg hurts.
It hurts?
Come on, try.
I can't.
Don t worry. Hold on tight.
That's it. Up you go.
He kicked me, and pulled my hair.
He burned me with cigarettes.
He made me drink urine.
At bedtime he'd give me laxatives.
When I misbehaved,
he'd lock me up in my room,
or in the closet,
and he said I couldn't get out
until I felt sorry,
and that he d let me die there.
He wouldn't let me see my friends,
and he made me work in the shop.
He insulted me.
He spit on me.
He said that I should have died
instead of my brother.
Can I say it?
Son of a bitch.
Bastard.
Asshole.
Shithead.
Motherfucker.
Pig.
Faggot.
