I take a long, Long nap in a brand new home.
This place, it's like I make up my mind to stay in this lovely, warm pink goo.
With the thumpedy thump of the heart.
My only true pal.
I tell the noisy world out side to fuck off with all your play acting.
Poor Runt, she going nowhere, for no one.
That was a time when silence was some sort of friend.
But then my mum, heave and rip all inside.
And Runt, she wakes up, cause a baby can't stay still forever.
A baby must be born.
So hold on mum, for the little baby she's comin out.
Push the baby. Push the head.
Ooh, the fuckin pain.
Mum crying like a barber herself, the silly cow.
Push now, push ya fuck mama, ya.
And I arrive into this world of mine,
with the light so bright,
it wakes me awake with my little baby scream.
She's a little beaut.
A diamond eh.
And I remember seeing my old Dad, so full of the happy he was.
The nursie hand me to my mum.
And she's so tired, yeah.
Opened up to spit me out into this funny old world.
I smile at her cause that's what babies do.
And for the one and only time, we three are a family.
Only a few moments old and I start thinking things then.
Staring at that white sky right above me.
And, I want for something altogether different.
And that's when I hear him.
And through the naudy and big ears ward, I search after his cry.
A cry so lonely it scares me and makes me cry too.
And all the sites that we could see they go invisible when we hear each others cries.
And that's when the magic it all begin.
It begin when the baby Pig and baby Runt, stare through their baby eyes you see.
And the crying and screamin'd stop.
From that moment we become one, and we need no one else... nobody.
Night 'ol sweet ting
Cheerio 'ol pal.
Tomorrow So?
Sure, what else? 
Night beautiful 
Nigh, night.
What's the color of love Pig? 
Sorry love, Love? 
Dunno.
But you know the way tings, they got a color?
I wonder what the color o love is.
Jesus Runt.
You could read a tousand tick books and never know the answer to dat quiz. 
It'll be a good one to know tho, hey? 
It'll be brilliant Runt.
It's here somewhere.
There you are Runt.
That's the Big Blue there.
All that water, huh?
Hey it'll all yours Pal.
Mine Pig?
Birday present init?
17 in 17 days on the 17th.
I wanna to walk into the sea and never come back.
I want the tide to take me out of me, and give me someone different.
Maybe for a half hour or so.
That'd be good wouldn't it Pig?
Say again 
Just for a try, you know? 
Jesus Runt that'd be impossible, 'a half hour', fuck! 
D'Ya know, they'd make a huge space ship rocket.
And take it up to the cosmo shiny stars all twinkle, twinkle.
And I'll sit in my saucer and I'll have a good look down on the big, big blue.
And there'll be a button called LASER that would blast all the shity bits that you'll see.
And I'll fire dat fireball,
and I'll fire back down to Cross Haven Beach,
knowin' dat all dat's left is my room, your room,
an a palace that shine out of the pool for the king and the queen.
Cause that's all that matters Runt.
The rest is just weekday stuff fun.
A palace.
It's a dream.
You know where the palace is.

Well excuse me!
It's simply not a healthy relationship.
I mean you have to separate them, for their own good.
Expulsion would be the easy way out.
In fact to be honest wit you I would like even go further
to having the little feckers flogged. 
This, is their reaction
to us not letting them in the end of year photograph.
Their over reaction. 
You don't say.
What should we do Saul? 
I tink da floggin idea sounds good.
This, is their career guidance forms.
Which we received back from yesterday. 
So as you can see here Darren wants to be a King and Sinead a Queen.
Most days, we wanna wish the mum and dad far away.
I remember tinkin, all da good tings we've already done.
And now only 5 years old,
and all the good tings to come for the deadly jewel.
It was me, and him.
So no word we speak,
as the world around jabbers out stuff that goes nowhere's to no one.
And we promise to never change.
To stay like this forever.
It's a sad old town ay Runt?
But our town ay pal?
Hey pal?

Then in the breath than from my mistress wreaks, Christ Mark get it together will ya?
And yet by heaven I tink my love is rare.
As any she beloi, but falls compare.

Excuse me.
'Scuse me Marky. Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me!

So what do I call ya?
Your name?
This is not a happy face I have.
I can understand why you've both done this,
it has to do with both'ya being thick.
Very little respect for property, none at all in fact.
I can understand that.
What I do not understand, is that
you Margaret must appreciate what I'm like when I'm place in a situation like this.
How angry I can get.
It's unforgivable what you've done.
Not just to the room, but obvioulsy that too,
but to me.
I'm very big on respect Sinead.
This is not a happy face then,
what sort of face is it?
An ugly face Miss!
No margaret,
it is an angry face.
Next Please.
Where to?
Doneagle.
Where in Doneagle?
Doneagle town is it?
Single or return?
Jesus in your own time!
Single is it?
HOw many?
You're not Spanish are ya!
HOW MANY? ONE OR TWO GRINGO?
One!
You'll be best wit da Irish boys Sinead.
Pasty white skin. Yellow teeth.
The eternal smell of smeg.
Unable to swim, completely addicted to sports.
And an all mighty fuck wit when it comes to matters of fore play.
Bout as tasty as a poached moth ball.
That about sums them up. 
How's it goin their Miss Chatterbox?
This's the life.
D'you like flowers?
This's for you.
Friendship thing.
It's a Bluebell.
Deadly name isn't it?
Bluebell.
And that's the Big Blue up their.
Now that, that is what I call tasty. 
Once upon a time ya see this grumpy old dad right.
He always fulla da drink.
Always hatin this little boy and girl who is da best of friends.
He always grabbin yeah.
Grabbin like the big dgreat runk monkey that he was.
Those big shitty hands and once again da fat cunt,
he take the hand to da little girls back.
All he want is a nice little baba girl he says.
Well fuck him da boy tinking.
The little boy tinks of a plan to see da wicked daddy put straight.
Cause the little boy and girl know that one day they'll be da king and queen of everything.
And they teach him alright.
And they imagine the pain he feel, as he as tiptoe trough his dead birdies,
he's one and onlys, feeling that sick old pain in his fat old head.
So the next time she feels those rough hands, she finds them real weak.
There he goes.
Grabin and shovin like he always did the old fuck!
So much drink he had on him, he made a real bad mistake.
And how would we know,
dat a big adventure would kick off that very night, for our hero dat is Runt.
Sinead!
Sinead! 
And the estate, go crazy looking for the lost girl.
Da police where tinkin she was robbed by some sick pervert or someting.
She suddenly world famous in da kingdom of Pork.
Boy, just stay still and waits.
Lost in the calm of the inside of his little head.
Boy he stay for ages yeah.
Ages and ages, just watin for the Runt.
And as he waits, he starts to imagine da story of Runt's adventure.
And it plays in his little head.
First da man in da car tink it was magic or maybe an angel or some E.T. or someting.
Da poor man, he has so many questions, but da girl, she stays silent of course.
He a sales man he say, but da girl and da boy know who he is.
Dey know lots more about dis man.
And da two, go all over the world it would seem.
Him drivin like a mad man.
A big road a water she sees that leads to no one knows where.
But her always wishen for da little boy to be by her side.... and her heart beats for one.
All the others, tink dat she must be dead.
And dat da poor little boy is all dead inside, with his life long disappeared.
He just wait, and stand and wait and wait.
And dat's when he knows, dat the outside world, dey understand naughting at all.
Cause Pig and Runt, dey both know da salesman he must come back and the salesman he in love.
Love, that brings him back each week on Friday at 10:06.
