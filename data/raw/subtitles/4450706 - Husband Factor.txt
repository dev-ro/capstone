I swear, girl...
There's an octopus here...
The size of my head.
Look, here.
Look, look.
A three-legged octopus
the size of my head.
- A three-legged octopus.
- Sure.
Ha.
There are three people
talking behind your back.
Talking nonstop.
So don't spill any secrets
about yourself.
Not a thing to anyone.
One of those three is blonde.
A snake.
With a dog's head.
A snake with a dog's head.
- So, a mythological figure?
- No idea.
That's Ferda.
Sure, it's Ferda.
The yellow peril.
I know it.
But don't fret...
The wise old man
is right behind you.
- Gandalf.
- I've no idea.
What's Gandalf doing behind me?
You have something good
coming your way soon.
He's telling you that.
Good grief!
But why behind my back?
Why not to my face?
Don't say your Auntie Aysel
didn't tell you.
Believe me, your heart will be
pitter-pattering before you know it.
Look, here.
You see?
He's tall.
Between 1.80-1.82.
- Look, dear. See?
- He's handsome.
And he was educated abroad.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
He's on his own.
A fresh-faced boy.
He doesn't have family.
So, he's an orphan.
Which means no mother-in-law.
What more do you want?
No sister-in-law either.
No grief!
But maybe I'd have liked
my sister-in-law.
Stop babbling.
Who ever liked their sister-in-law?
No sister-in-law,
no cause for war. Right?
Believe me, he's on his knees.
And holding stones like this.
Three stones.
- You're making it up!
- No, I swear on it.
I swear to God she'll marry.
By the year's end.
Don't say I didn't say.
Let's hope so.
I'm as single as can be
and quite happy.
Stop talking nonsense.
The early bird catches the sperm.
Right, GÃ¶nÃ¼l?
That's so gross, Aysel.
I feel nauseous.
Why are you hijacking my art?
- I'm not. Don't say that.
- You sure as hell are.
Everything I see stays with me.
Go away!
There are other girls after you.
Wait.
I swear to God
there's a name here.
Look, look.
See? Look, there's an A.
There's a B.
There's an R.
Wait.
Abdurrrahman.
- Go wash it, go on!
- OK, I've shut up.
For the love of God,
just wash it!
Your daughter's too sassy
to ever get married.
Didn't you just say
you'd found him?
Get out of here for heaven's sake!
Sass bag.
The hell you'll find a husband.
But maybe I'd be really happy
with Abdurrahman.
Abdurrahman would divorce you.
Obsession with marriage
is in the DNA of Turkish women.
I'm afraid that's truer than ever
in our house.
If you have a husband, fine.
If not, you're in trouble.
You're only worth
the husband you have.
We all have a writer
we think is the best on love.
Here's mine.
My bedside book is
"The Best Writer on Love".
The book is about
pure, sincere, profound love.
I can't find anyone my type
so I turned to the book.
Go on, read away.
You've lost what sense you had.
A book in your hand 24/7.
What's with you?
Why do you read so much?
They write, I read.
Look at you.
You've turned 30.
You're officially an old maid.
Says who?
Look around you.
You won't find anyone.
Why's that?
C'mon, am I such a loser?
You're unappealing.
And full of sarcasm.
Boys don't like girls like that.
You're useless around the house too.
You've basically just trashed me.
I'm serious.
Take my advice.
Look, be more feminine.
Be coy, be flirty.
Use lipstick.
Look, like this.
You're the only Izmirian in this family
who isn't Izmirian.
Like your marriages are all
made in heaven.
Don't get me venting, Gran.
Don't get lippy.
I just wish...
I'd see one of you married
before I die.
Step aside, girls.
And good night to you, Peyker HanÄ±m.
You made my night!
Neither of you say a word
or I'll take it out on you.
I don't believe it.
What I don't get is this.
Can't I be happy being single?
Huh?
No, I'm supposed to use makeup...
To get my hair fixed daily,
to take cooking classes...
And exercise like crazy...
So hubby can handle a nice firm ass.
I'm supposed to blow...
Every cent I own on a husband
who isn't even in my life yet, huh?
OK, let's say I find him.
Then I turn magically into Miss World...
In a skintight
strapless wedding gown...
That's like
drawing a curtain over my life.
We honeymoon on an exotic island.
On Facebook, Twitter and Instagram...
I post photos of
exotic pineapple cocktails...
And then ones of just my feet...
As I recline on a sun lounger
by the waves.
To keep the chemistry alive
I meet hubby at the door...
When he gets home from work.
Oof, sis.
Enough, please!
You give these Turkish guys
inflated egos.
So put them in their place.
- Sis.
- Yes, TuÄŸÃ§e?
- Where are you going tomorrow?
- BeÅŸiktaÅŸ.
No way.
What are you wearing?
How about something sexy?
Sexy is your look.
Get out, fast.
Out!
- But, sis.
- TuÄŸÃ§e, get out.
- But what are you--
- No buts. Just get out. Now!
I'm not a fancy kind of girl.
You saw for yourselves.
Even my gran says I'm unappealing.
I talk a lot, yes, I know.
But only because
I read and think a lot.
Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼, wait.
Wait, I'll give you a hand.
Here.
Good morning.
Who ever finds
the perfect career right away?
Well, I did.
Mom says
I should've been an air hostess...
Because guys like air hostesses.
But I got into publishing.
Wait, I haven't introduced myself.
Hi, I'm Efsun.
Oof, Timur.
- Bunny.
- Where have you been?
I'm writing copy for a kitchen sponge.
My brain's a washout.
I'm totally out of it.
How are you?
Fine. Nothing new.
- Ready for a good time?
- Sure.
Here it comes.
Efsun, can you zap it twice?
I left my card at home.
Sure, bunny.
Always gotta fork out for Timur.
Timur, this place is so nice.
Small, cozy, I love it.
Sure, bunny.
BeÅŸiktaÅŸ has it all.
Here, try.
The stands are packed out.
BeÅŸiktaÅŸ will be kicking off
this mega-match.
And the match begins
with the BeÅŸiktaÅŸ kickoff.
BeÅŸiktaÅŸ forever.
I'd give my life whenever.
Nothing can take away.
The love we send your way.
BeÅŸiktaÅŸ forever.
They can't be here
to watch the match, huh?
Timur, what's with the match?
Do we have to watch?
Shoot!
Timur, what game is this?
BeÅŸiktaÅŸ.
I got that.
Who are they playing?
Trabzon. Can't you see?
No. I'm kind of nearsighted.
Shoot!
It was the dinner
I'd been dreaming of.
Timur, me,
and a truckload of guys.
Asshole.
Did you say something?
C'mon, you scored.
You must be happy.
- But no one's scored.
- Exactly.
Let's hope they get to it fast.
Let's hope.
Excuse me, could I get
a glass of raki?
Efsun, tell me
and I'll order it.
It's OK. I've done it.
Why are you talking to the waiter
when I'm here?
Tell me and I'll do it.
Pal, give the lady a raki.
Lady? It just struck the gentleman
that I'm female.
I'm tempted to climb on the table...
Take off all my clothes
and start dancing.
Baby.
Take a selfie of me and my pals,
will you?
Sure, but when did you become pals?
Turn it around.
Quick, it's low on juice.
Juice?
Oh my God!
Guys, let's do the eagle pose.
Snap away.
Take a few.
Let's see.
I want to get up
and punch Timur in the face, but...
There are so many of them.
Goal!
I'm just going to the bathroom.
Ah! You?
- Efsun.
- What are you doing here?
C'mon.
Why does this happen?
The reward for a year alone
shouldn't have been a night like that.
Look at me.
The head I always hold high
is sagging on my shoulders.
Trying to look strong
will kill me.
I guess my biggest regret in life...
Is having been nice
to the wrong people.
All I wanted
was a healthy relationship.
When I say â€˜healthy'...
I don't mean he should
fetch and carry me in an ambulance...
Slip shoe covers on my feet
and dose me with iodine.
Iodine?
I had three other boyfriends
before this dork.
I never made a scene.
I was never jealous.
I was all humility, but...
All three cheated on me.
And to top it all...
They married the girls
they cheated on me with.
That isn't nice at all.
Who are you?
Maki, the tea-boy.
Want some tea, auntie?
Auntie?
You called me â€˜auntie'?
What should I call you?
OK, you're right.
Look, a 30th birthday gift.
See how they show when I laugh?
- Look at my crow's feet.
- Crow's feet?
Auntie, you're baked.
Still â€˜auntie'!
I'll smack you, I swear I will.
All my friends have been
breeding like rabbits.
- I'll die alone, I know it.
- Don't say that.
If I give you a tea
you won't die.
OK, young whippersnapper.
- Efsun.
- I'm back.
- What's going on?
- The heating's off. We're frozen.
Come through.
Merve has some dynamite news.
Pissy Merve and dynamite news.
Yeah right.
She pissed her pants till she was 13,
hence the name Pissy.
And she still talks like a baby.
- Merve's getting married.
- What?
Pissy's getting married?
Pissy Merve's getting married?
- Efsun.
- May it be your turn next, niece!
The boy's a charmer,
so tall and handsome.
He's educated.
And rich to boot.
He has the greenest eyes.
Like a hotel pool.
The five-star kind.
Look, look.
He's posted a video on Facebook.
Here, c'mon.
- Look at that.
- Wonderful.
He's gorgeous, huh?
I don't mean because he's the groom.
He's super romantic...
And super rich.
WILL YOU SHARE THE KEY
OF THE SAME HOUSE WITH ME?
Mom, look.
Look at that stone.
Horseshoe size!
Yes!
Mom.
Elephant-shoe more like.
That's in your face.
But you haven't found anyone.
Forget horseshoes,
we'd settle for an ant-shoe.
And that's sticking the knife in.
The boy told Merve...
He wanted the wedding right away.
The wedding's
at the end of this month.
You mean in four weeks, Aunt?
They're coming to ask for her hand
on Friday.
<Text VPosition="85" VAlign="bottom"
HAlign="center" >MERVE HAS TO BE PREGNANT!
Mom.
- Merve's pregnant, right?
- No.
We did eight tests.
Whoa! Eight?
Why do it together?
To see the results together.
If she'd been pregnant
Nur would've broken her legs.
She's only 20.
Why's she marrying?
Get the door.
Efsun.
Have you heard?
Auntie.
All that moping about
and you missed your chance.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Good night.
This house is more club than home.
Ãœresin? TÃ¼resin?
Merve's getting married.
- Who's Merve?
- You've gotten so old.
You've lost your marbles.
Remember Uncle's son?
Girls!
- Come through.
- GÃ¶nÃ¼l.
- Welcome.
- There's a wedding.
I almost forgot to introduce them.
Ãœresin and TÃ¼resin.
The last old maids in the family
before me.
Are you married?
Or engaged?
Got a boyfriend?
Not even that?
The hell you'll find a husband.
How old are you?
You won't find anyone.
Got a boyfriend?
- Too sassy.
- You're 30 now.
Got a boyfriend?
Before woman and man
were labeled separate genders...
They existed as a single sphere.
They were so clever, capable
and full of life...
That the gods felt threatened
by the perfect match.
And Zeus split the sphere in two
down the middle.
Woman and man.
Idiot Zeus.
What a screw-up!
We're just rolling along.
If I can't find my other sock...
How do I find my other half-sphere?
What's up?
Not going to work?
I don't feel up to it, no.
Oh, and for those who worry
I have no father...
Let me introduce my dad, Oktay.
A one-time lawyer
turned househusband.
Another soap schedule?
Your mom has a point.
How else can she keep track?
They keep changing all the times.
- Dad.
- Hm?
Do you believe
everyone has another half?
After being married for 35 years?
You're in a state.
What's up?
Yes.
A state of emergency.
Girls!
C'mon, girls.
Ãœresin, TÃ¼resin.
C'mon, quick.
Hello, Kitties.
Seval!
Hello.
Princess, welcome!
Let's get started right away.
Hello, sweetie.
Darlings, didn't you find anyone?
You'll wither up so young.
C'mon. Like I'm gonna eat you up.
Step aside, ducky.
I guess you cut too much last time.
My hair just won't grow.
I'll fix you a treatment right away.
Just leave it to me.
Sweetie, when was your last haircut?
I don't know.
It's been a while.
Whoever did it messed up.
The layers are a disaster.
Layers?
It's like the cake fell apart!
Let me tell you a fact, sweetie.
This isn't hair; it's felt.
But leave it to me.
I'll give you a whole new image.
How about highlights?
- Do you even know what highlights are?
- What can I say?
Get the patient ready fast.
Caner!
Patient?
- When did you last have a manicure?
- Never.
Do you push back the cuticles?
- Sure, go for it.
- A square or oval shape?
- Whichever looks best.
- Are we doing the brows?
I don't think so.
I can't browse here.
"No."
Hey, cuz.
- What do you say?
- About what? What's that?
No way!
Someone left their butt behind, huh?
Never heard of Brazilian butts?
Silicone panties.
They boost what you have.
And give a lifted, protruding look.
You mean jump on the butt wagon.
No, petal. Use mine.
Don't waste money on those.
Sis.
The only place I can wear this
is some seedy club in Aksaray.
How are you gonna tell Dad?
That's what I'm wondering.
Oh, c'mon.
â€˜Dad, there's no money in books...'
â€˜So I decided
to go for pole dancing.'.
I'll wear this skirt...
These shoes
and this floor rag on top.
But if you whack me
right across the mouth...
- I might come to my senses.
- You're overdoing it, sis.
Wearing this, I'd find custom
on the curbside, not a husband.
Look. Now c'mon, out.
Go to your room, please.
I'm looking at nothing else.
Good night.
C'mon.
Pull your skirt down.
Good night.
As you can see, I'm a mess.
- Making some changes, are you?
- Yes.
- I decided to find a husband.
- Deciding does the job, huh?
I don't know. I hear it can.
I'll give it a go.
Marriage is a serious decision.
- Efsun--
- It's over, OK?
The old Efsun's gone.
I don't want to hear.
Not even you can change my mind.
What am I saying?
I tell my writer I want a husband.
God will damn me for sure.
I think you can handle the rest
without me.
Sure, Ferda HanÄ±m.
Efsun, did you
want to leave early?
- An hour early is fine.
- For your cousin's wedding?
But she's only 20.
Now I see.
God knows, you must feel so bad.
Why would I feel bad, Ferda HanÄ±m?
Look, this is crazy.
You're such an introvert.
Think of us as family.
Open up, it'll help.
No, thanks. I'm fine.
No. Your cousin's marrying at 20.
You've turned 30...
- And you're still single.
- Ferda HanÄ±m.
OK, OK.
You can leave any time
if it makes you feel better.
It's not about feeling better...
All she reads
is supermarket flyers...
And she comes here as chief editor.
She has six sugars in a small tea.
The bitch!
Ferda's a witch, I swear.
The long-awaited day had come.
We all know why we're here.
The youngsters love each other.
Sure, but love won't feed them.
What was I saying?
It's not for us to comment.
Are you crazy?
Of course it is.
As her mom, I...
I should be commenting.
By the grace of God and the Prophet...
We seek your daughter's hand
for our son.
What's wrong, son?
- Relax.
- What's wrong, son?
- What did you put in the coffee?
- Chili pepper.
God damn you!
Ask for the girl.
Dad.
Is your son allergic to coffee
or something?
No. Only to chili pepper.
It was a joke.
I did it for a laugh.
Quick! Don't worry, son.
You'll get over it.
Wait!
We don't have an engagement photo.
Merve.
Where's the ring?
- Mom, take it.
- Over here, Aunt.
- Mom.
- Am I in it?
But show your hand.
OK, we're showing our hands.
Selfie.
Smile.
I lift them up
to a count of four.
Ceren.
Are the Murat's eyes shut here?
I give my hands a good rub.
Ladies, be extra careful.
I lower them to a count of four.
One.
GÃ¶nÃ¼l?
Not again?
Another Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼ special.
He'll be here any second.
â€˜Efsun, the electricity...'.
Here he is.
Take care of it.
- Efsun.
- Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼? What's up?
I'm fine.
How's it going?
Haven't seen you in ages.
- No.
- No.
Umm, I came to see
if your elenctricity's down.
Electricity, not elenctricity.
Yes. Why?
I was wondering, umm...
You look lovely again, Efsun.
- Thanks, but back to the electricity.
- Yes.
Efsun.
We had watermelon today,
you know?
Great. Now, please. Look at me.
Just fix it, huh?
OK.
Efsun.
Don't forget.
You're always lovely.
Thank you, Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼.
Now get to work.
OK, I'm fixing it. OK.
OK.
The only guy to love me
beyond question, no matter how I look.
Ready for the brand new Efsun?
Close your eyes.
Come through, c'mon.
And here's the brand new Efsun.
Your mother's daughter.
Are your lenses in?
No, Gran, because...
I don't know anyone.
Plus my mascara...
You don't get it.
You'll see new people,
not guys you know.
Widen that radar range.
Petal, there's a saying.
It goes: A guy will dump you
wherever you found him. Right, Gran?
C'mon, we're going.
Let's go, sis.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Whoa! So you're the famous Efsun, huh?
Famous?
You saw me in the celeb news?
Get that.
You're hilarious.
- Hi, I'm Hayrican.
- Nice meeting you, Hayrican.
You too.
Girls, are we ready to party?
- Totally.
- Yes.
The warrior's with us tonight.
Sis.
You can't be in love
for a lifetime.
Someone will show up
but you won't realize.
You can't take
those kinds of games.
You have a heart.
C'mon, sis.
Thank God there are no paparazzi.
Imagine, a full page of your panties!
TuÄŸÃ§e, move
or those panties are over your head.
Efsie, what are you drinking, babe?
What are you drinking, babe?
Mineral water.
If I've learned anything in life,
it's this, guys.
You gotta drink to have a good time.
C'mon, get the vibe!
Get the vibe!
I asked for mineral water,
not a cheeseburger.
That's a drink too.
- Watch out, man.
- Watch out yourself.
I didn't see you.
How could you at that height?
I'll do your head in.
Don't make me crazy.
- Don't make me crazy.
- Who wants a shot contest with me?
I should drink
whatever that guy's drinking.
He has to get that grit
from somewhere.
He's 1.20 and threatening Hayrican.
By doing his head in
he must've meant bite his kneecaps.
Hey there,
what's with the pictures?
Am I exposing myself again?
That's private.
Shame on you.
My old teacher.
Teacher, it's Efsun,
student no. 358.
Teacher.
Don't you remember me?
Efsun.
Efsun Ozcim.
My Peppercorn.
Me?
Snap away.
Hey, what's this?
- Here.
- Who are you?
Are you here too?
I don't know. Am I?
I don't believe
we're here right now either.
You've seen me like this.
Friends are for days like this,
don't worry.
Besides, loving someone is just that.
You love them all the way.
You'll meet someone you love
and who loves you all the way.
After 14 years.
No, it can't be possible.
The high-school boy
I've never confessed to...
My one and maybe only love, Sinan.
Years later here he is.
He hasn't changed at all.
I worry he's even nicer actually.
- What did I tell you?
- What?
That you'd meet someone
who loves you as you are.
You did,
but I didn't pay much attention.
I can smell his smell.
He's just a breath away.
I want to melt into his lips.
I close my eyes tight shut.
Efsun?
- Baby, come and join us.
- What?
Sinan.
Why didn't you wake me?
- You were asleep, sis.
- Is Sinan here for breakfast every day?
You could've removed this nightdress.
Efsun.
She's still calling.
We're coming, Mom.
Ceren.
With or without the blanket?
Take your blanket and go.
You aren't with us.
Efsun?
Are you feeling better?
Aren't you gonna say hello
to your friend?
Our Efsun can be very out of it.
- Better compared to what?
- Last night.
Don't you remember?
But you remember me, right?
Oh, ducky.
Did you have to drink so much?
You know, Sinan,
Efsun and alcohol just don't get along.
Hence the state she was in.
I was shocked
to see you like that last night.
Sinan then gave me
a blow-by-blow account.
He came over and said, "Efsun".
I said, "Sinan"...
And threw up all over him.
Wait, wait.
- Sinan rushed me to the girls' room.
- How many is that?
I raced to Serdar OrtaÃ§'s table
insisting he was my Peppercorn.
To top it all
I popped bottles of champagne...
To celebrate us meeting up
after so many years.
And what I did on the way out
was just awful.
Efsun.
There are thousands of dancers.
Mom!
Dancers!
When I was sure you were OK
I left.
But my mind was on you.
You're better, huh?
This vile smell
must be coming from me.
Where in hell
is the nightdress from?
It's Mom's.
So, that's how you were
destined to meet again, Sinan.
Come for dinner tonight.
Sure.
Sure, I'd love to.
I missed your cooking.
The master's been upstaged, Sinan.
Efsun will be cooking dinner.
She makes this cheese pie, Sinan...
I tell you, it's to die for.
But I can't put cheese on brea--
Efsun, Sinan's one of us, isn't he?
Don't be modest now.
He'll think you mean it.
- So there's a feast tonight.
- Sure, Sinan.
You have to try my pie tonight.
Sinan.
I'm really sorry about last night.
But you were so cute.
What, throwing up?
Are you taking the mickey?
Yes.
What?
Finally you pull something off!
Sis, the guy's drop-dead gorgeous!
- Don't let him go.
- Go, girls.
Efsun.
Honey, put slippers on.
You'll give your ovaries a chill.
Then take a bath
and go to the hairdresser, OK?
- I'm moving into the kitchen.
- I was gonna make pie.
You can't even put cheese on bread.
The pie is your father's job.
The past is so powerful
And memories so fragile.
But we were only kids back then.
Growing up was a dream
We didn't make plans.
A loving smile was what mattered.
Like an old movie
Like a well-read letter.
Did you keep those good times too?
Does your heart find its voice
In your hands.
Like the streets of my childhood
And my grandmother's cooking?
Love is so powerful
And this heart so fragile.
But we were only kids back then.
Like an old movie
Like a well-read letter.
Did you keep those good times too?
You know how some dreams
Never fade with time.
Like paper horses.
- LOVE IS.
- Some flowers sweep you away.
Even if you don't realize.
- SHARING THINGS MONEY WON'T BUY.
- They grow in the shadows.
- ReÅŸit Ã‡Ä±nar.
- No, Bilge Sezer. He was the worst.
But I was amazed
to see you like that.
With the hair and makeup.
Efsun's always
impeccably groomed, Sinan.
Aren't you, Efsun?
She won't go anywhere
without mascara.
She was impeccable at school too
but she didn't wear makeup.
True. OK, Efsun.
Bring the pie from the kitchen.
Off you go, honey.
Let's move over to the table.
Sinan, let's put you at the head.
Out the way, c'mon.
Give those here.
You'll make a mess of it.
Why's that?
In there it's all â€˜Efsun darling'
and out here I'm an idiot.
C'mon, Efsun.
Stop goofing around.
Efsun's pie.
Here you go.
Efsun, I don't believe my eyes.
Did you really make it?
- No, Dad did.
- Your dad did?
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
I've missed things like this.
What does it have in it?
It has spinach.
Love it.
How did you make it?
OK, it's like this.
I put filo on the bottom.
On top too, actually.
The spinach in between cooks
at 50 degrees till transparent.
What, like onions?
At 100 degrees.
Silly me, not 50.
For 10 minutes.
Silly me, not 10 minutes.
Two hours.
Forget two hours, four.
Over a low heat.
Actually...
Till it's cooked to a char...
I keep an eye on it the whole time.
I sprinkle black stuff on top
for flavor.
She's just like her mom.
Never gives away the whole recipe.
That's the secret pie recipe
of the women of this family, right?
Oktay, you're embarrassing us.
- Try Efsun's beans.
- Yes.
Efsun, here, honey.
- Pass that to me.
- My beans are unbelievable.
You won't taste beans like this
in eight World Cups.
I say that was his best match.
True.
- Sinan, you shouldn't.
- No problem.
I did lick it clean, though.
What a fabulous cook you are.
Thanks.
I'm thinking of doing a book.
The Galloping Gourmet in Me.
I'll be back for more of your pie,
I warn you.
OK. I'll tell Dad.
C'mon, you throw this time.
- No way!
- Six.
And four.
How come feelings stay so fresh...
When mince goes off in the fridge
in four days?
As he leaves
Sinan kisses me on the cheek.
But that moment...
I want to stick my mouth on his
with superglue.
I want to hug him tight
and not let go.
If you exist, there must be
another one of you somewhere.
The woman must've mentioned
Zeus's sphere for a reason.
Turns out I've been waiting
for Sinan for an age.
Sis!
Who's the moony girl with SortaÃ§?
- Who's SortaÃ§?
- Oof!
- The singer, Serdar OrtaÃ§.
- What?
What kind of pose is that?
What's this?
My eyes are closed.
I don't believe it.
Alcohol is the mother of all evils.
Wakey, wakey.
Wakey, wakey.
Oh God.
What's going on?
What's up?
Is there some kaffeeklatsch
I don't know about?
OK, suppose Sinan texts you.
- What do you do?
- Jump for joy of course.
Cuz, what are you talking about?
I text him back, petal.
What else?
She's lost it.
No! Don't be insane.
You wait at least half an hour.
You reply in no more than two words.
- Good grief. Why?
- Efsun?
Women are birds.
And these birds...
Come in two kinds: birds in the hand
and birds on the wire.
Men should never see you
as a bird in the hand.
Just when it looks like
you'll hop into his hand...
You must fly away.
Because men's desire
is the bird on the wire.
Grandma!
But first make him feel
like a man.
He must think he's king.
Let him order what you eat
and pay the check.
Be intimate but aloof.
Be jealous and make him jealous
without overdoing it.
If you're wondering
what I've done to men before now...
The answer is
none of that stuff.
There's a real philosophy
to what the girls are saying.
Also smile the whole time.
I don't need this.
Don't hide your smile.
Why do they watch
Victoria's Secret fashion shows?
Why do they love Miranda Kerr?
Because us mortals
don't have bodies like that.
What do you think?
OK, but the biggest thing?
They're always smiling.
Why?
Because they're confident.
Get into football.
Look, we even have combo tickets.
- For which team?
- Chanel.
How do you know what team
the prospect supports?
We had Hayrican cover all bases.
Get out of here!
Playstation.
That's crucial.
What? Can't I have
any of my own hobbies?
Don't give me your â€˜hobbies', Efsun.
You never leave the house.
You shut yourself up in your room
and gabble to yourself.
You think we don't hear?
Plus don't surrender to him
just like that.
Don't let him kiss you.
What do they say, girls?
Let him look but not touch.
OK, so here...
Efsun, move over.
OK, what did you have?
I had a brain once,
but not any more.
You'll thank the girls
when you find a husband.
- I have email.
- So, what do you want to sign up for?
Three words, foreign:
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.
OK, then.
Let's start with Facebook.
Name, surname, OK, but...
What do we put
for relationship status?
Destiny. Or kismet.
Or wait,
just put "husband wanted".
The profile picture?
Use that English Patient movie poster.
Get out!
Are you sick?
No, I'm English.
PÄ±nar, I've had it. Sign me up,
friend Sinan and be done with it.
- No way!
- What?
Let Sinan friend you first.
You're the lady after all.
Play hard to get.
He's calling. It's him.
Sinan's calling!
I don't answer. I make him wait.
I let it ring.
It has to ring.
God knows why.
Shall I answer?
He hung up.
- He hung up.
- Oh my God.
Efsun.
Are you on the phone again?
When you say â€˜again'?
Have you compiled that list of
best-selling crime novels?
That sweater looks perfect
over the shirt.
Tasteless.
Did I ask you if that brain
went with your head?
Sinan?
How about we do something
if you're free?
Umm, er...
Well, OK. Sure.
I'm busy actually, but...
OK, maybe. I mean...
Umm, in that case, why not?
We could do.
OK, let me make a call
if that's OK.
One second.
No, I have one.
I'll be real quick.
If you don't mind.
I'll be right back.
If it's OK.
Just one second.
I was gonna say...
He's here, Ceren.
What do I do?
Sinan. Who else?
He's here.
He says let's do something.
Yes.
Yes.
Let him look but not touch?
What? Why would I let him touch me?
Are you crazy?
Sinan, sorry about last night.
We barely got to talk.
When Dad finds a backgammon partner--
It was a nice evening.
I miss the cozy home thing.
I want a return game.
Tell Oktay not to get his hopes up.
He misses a cozy home, not me.
Let's crank the heat so he stays.
I wrote so often from Switzerland
and did I get one reply, young lady?
C'mon, Sinan. That was high school.
How long ago was that?
Anyway, I'm back now.
My dad passed the business to me
six months ago.
Good for him.
Efsun, are you OK?
Sure. Why? What's up?
I don't know.
You used to be more chill.
It's like you've changed.
For God's sake, Sinan.
Is anything ever constant in life?
The only thing constant
is change itself.
What the hell is that?
Oh, sorry. Just having
a philosophical moment.
The girls put a spell on me.
Hungry?
Wanna try
this mind-blowing kofta place?
- Sure.
- It'll blow your mind though.
OK, I was being ridiculous.
Sorry.
Are you on Facebook etc?
Yes. Friend me.
I will.
So, all good things come to an end.
And tonight's over.
Maybe we can do something
this weekend?
- OK. Go to a football match?
- A match?
But why?
You don't like football.
Well...
OK. Then we'll do something.
OK, keep Friday night free.
First dinner, then the movies.
- Done.
- Done.
Then I should go.
Then I should go up.
Then should we kiss?
Now we've had onions.
Sinan, are you OK?
A slipper.
Is that your place?
No, of course not.
We don't have any 35s.
Are you OK?
I'm fine.
Oh God.
- Anyway, I should go.
- OK.
- Good night then.
- Bye.
Don't get cold.
Meeting Sinan's lips
was wishful thinking.
But right now
I have bigger fish to fry.
What's with throwing a slipper
at Sinan's head?
Cakes are baked in this house
all the time. Do they lace them?
What kind of mindset is that?
- Who threw this slipper?
- What slipper?
What slipper do you think?
This one.
Why throw a slipper?
Are you insane?
Didn't we say no kissing
on the first date?
What's it to you?
For God's sake.
If only you'd tossed a flowerpot
and broken us up for good.
Thank God for the slipper.
We spared the boy.
Oof.
- Do I stink?
- Uh-huh.
He had them too.
Are you meeting again?
Because he didn't see
who threw the slipper, yes.
On Friday.
Dinner first, then the movies.
Find out his plans for the future
over dinner.
Go to a romantic movie.
Walk past the jewelry stores.
And slip in a question
about his monthly pay.
Get out, Gran.
I don't believe it.
Why bother watching soaps?
Watch each other.
Efsun.
What star sign is Sinan?
Gemini.
A roller-coaster star sign.
Look, should we
rethink this business?
You're right, Mom.
It's "business", huh?
- Why?
- Well, you're Virgo.
There's no future in it.
Why? What's wrong with Geminis?
They can't do serious dating.
OK, they're funny, but...
They punch you right in the mouth
when you're laughing.
They're messy characters.
His ascendant's important.
Efsun, do you know
what time Sinan was born?
07.42 at Siyami Ersek, Aunt.
You're gonna make me crazy,
I swear.
I need to get married fast
just to get out of this house.
Pooh.
Has she been eating onions?
Thanks.
You know the most important thing
in a relationship?
This fur's fake, right?
The most important thing is
being able to be yourself.
Mom?
Grandma.
Excuse me.
Your phone's ringing.
Your phone. Your phone.
Your phone.
Hello, Timur?
Were you asleep, bunny?
Lentil brain.
No, Timur.
I was waiting for you to call.
You saw I poked you on Facebook?
No. I don't plan to look either.
If you don't mind...
I'll just go back to sleep...
And carry on with my dream
where I left off.
Bunny?
Here you go, piping hot pies.
- Does Sinan have WhatsApp?
- No idea. I don't use it.
OK, I'm off.
Wait. Download it now.
Check when he was last on it.
And when you're together
go through his phone.
Beware the decent-looking guy.
Ceren? â€˜Go through his phone'?
Sure she should go through it.
- OK, I'm out of here. Thanks, Mom.
- Bye, honey.
- Efsun.
- Yes, Ceren.
Go on What is it this time?
We urgently need a photo of you.
With cats and babies.
- To put on Facebook.
- Why a photo with cats?
To show you as an animal lover,
a potential mother.
Give me your passwords.
And I'll spice up your accounts.
Listen, what does
getting poked on Facebook mean?
- You get pregnant.
- Oof, Ceren. Go away.
Efsun.
Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼,
you gave me a fright.
- I was just waiting for you, Efsun.
- Why? What's up?
Nothing.
I was just waiting.
OK, see you.
- Efsun.
- Yes?
- Have a good week.
- You too.
She told me to have a good week.
There's now a point to waking up,
getting dressed, even eating.
When someone likes you
it makes you feel better.
It's a wonder I was happy without you.
Reach over and hold my hand
Go on.
We're destined to journey together
To share the same pillow.
Imagine life begins now.
If you feel better...
Even your smile is different.
Welcome, Friday!
Oh my! I just mopped that bit.
Efsun!
Efsun. C'mon, honey. Get up.
Now, c'mon.
Get up, sis. C'mon.
The sis I know
won't go anywhere tonight.
One last chance.
She will.
Are you crazy?
Go where?
Ceren, text Sinan and tell him
to be here at 8.00.
Don't do it. Ceren.
Look, you're all set.
- No way.
- Cuz.
Your bag's ready too.
Toothpaste.
Lipstick.
- Blusher.
- Can't do without it.
But most important of all...
A map of the Kanyon Mall.
What do I want with that?
I marked all the shops selling rings.
How about the ones
selling whistles, Gran?
OK, that's the final whistle going.
But, cuz.
C'mon, out.
Niecey, you know what?
I've had advice
from everyone but you.
Look at Merve.
It's her wedding soon.
Just think
who you should ask for advice.
I'm listening.
Remember the golden rule.
- Trip out.
- Trip out?
- What's a Turkish girl's first duty?
- Be honest and hardworking.
- No. Trip out.
- How do you mean?
Like this: you turn
a simple 10-second discussion...
...into a one-hour bag of problems.
Say the boy does something
you don't like.
- Pick from three responses.
- Go on.
The first is attitude.
Attitude?
â€˜All right, all right, OK.'
â€˜I don't know.'
â€˜Don't touch me.
Please, don't touch.'
â€˜I'm not tripping out at you, OK?'
â€˜I'm trying to explain myself.'.
Stuff like that
can make the guy crazy.
What's the second?
Sulk. Sit there pouting for hours
without saying a word.
And the third?
Act as if nothing's wrong.
Then soon as you're home
let it all out in a text message.
Aunt, I'm only allowed to say
two words per message.
Tripping out doesn't count.
Every day I learn something new
about woman-man relationships.
If I have to trip out, so be it.
- Welcome, Sinan Bey.
- Thank you, Ferhat Bey.
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.
This way please.
Hello, Sinan Bey. Welcome.
This way.
I have to let Sinan pick what we eat.
He has to feel important.
How ridiculous.
What do you want to eat?
No idea. You choose.
OK. How about wine?
I'll have some if you do.
- Thanks.
- Bon appÃ©tit.
Sinan, I have a question
now you're finally back.
About how you see the future.
- What, of the universe?
- No, your future.
- Your future plans.
- Skip that. Tell me about you.
- What's been going on?
- I'll explain later.
You go out now,
you have a good time.
Are you just into cruising
or does being alone get to you?
No way. Sinan?
- Ah, Selin.
- Hey.
Sorry, Efsun.
I don't believe it.
- How are you?
- Fine. You?
- How long's it been?
- Years. You're just the same.
Really?
You always said the sweetest things.
Here's the chance
a Turkish girl longs for.
To trip out to the max.
- Efsun, let me introduce Selin.
- I'm so sorry.
- Selin. Good to meet you.
- You too.
Let me sit for a second.
You and Istanbul.
Oh my God!
- Back for good?
- If I can get things on track.
If you can't, who can?
- How's your family?
- Fine.
There's so much to talk about
after all these years.
I'm, like, in a trance and babbling.
I haven't seen Sinan since we broke up.
Selin and I were together for a time.
But years ago.
A really long time ago.
That's what she meant.
I'm not jealous, am I?
So, what else is going on?
You know me better than anyone.
I couldn't not work.
The good news is
I became managing partner last week.
That solitaire on her left hand
means she's engaged.
No, isn't that the right hand?
Oh, hell, whichever.
Basically she's attached.
She's young, gorgeous, has a career.
Should I be jealous of her or Sinan?
Anyway, let me leave you two to it.
Efsun, you're great together.
- Hope you guys have good news soon.
- Amen.
OK then, I'm off.
- Great to meet you.
- You too.
- Hope to see you again.
- Sure.
- Good to see you.
- Bye.
She expects good news from us.
I like her.
Did you say â€˜amen'?
No, I...
It just came out like that.
Wow. Her butt's all orange peel.
I wouldn't know.
It's been ages.
I mean since I saw Selin.
Sinan, we got off the subject.
Do you plan to get married?
Well, one day. Why not?
But...
It's time.
Do you have the tickets?
I'm really sorry.
Excuse me.
Yes, Gran?
Is something wrong?
- Put tomatoes in the freezer...
- Everything OK?
- So they're easier to peel.
- I'm off to the bathroom.
- Let them freeze.
- The bathroom.
Then hold them under the tap.
- And the skins slip off.
- Gran, what is this?
If I put Sinan in the freezer,
will his clothes slip off?
Less of that sass.
I'm talking about cooking.
- Been to the jewelers yet?
- I'm hanging up.
She's hung up.
The program is about to begin
in Screen Three.
Enjoy the movie.
There was a long line.
What's this doing here?
I don't believe it.
Excuse me!
We found a phone in this drink.
And we're regulars here.
- This is undrinkable now.
- No, it isn't.
It's completely fine.
Not bad.
You owe me a phone.
- Grab this.
- No, leave it.
You'll get thirsty.
Efsun, I have a question.
Do I annoy you?
Why do you say that, Sinan?
Of course not.
I don't know.
I was just asking.
Do I annoy you?
- Do you find me annoying?
- No.
You sometimes act weird.
But you don't annoy me.
No, it seems like I have.
I don't believe it.
I didn't realize.
- Efsun.
- But running into you again...
- Efsun. Calm down.
- After all that time...
It sent me into a spin.
You don't annoy me.
- What's this?
- Open it and see.
THE BEST WRITER ON LOVE
I don't believe it.
You remembered.
I haven't forgotten
a single thing about you.
LOVE IS SHARING THINGS
MONEY CAN'T BUY
Efsun.
- Hey.
- Sinan.
Get out of there.
Get out.
Sinan, it's OK.
I know Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼.
He's from our building.
Efsun.
Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼,
what are you doing?
Efsun, guess what.
What?
It's strawberry time, Efsun.
We'll get strawberries sometime, OK?
- OK.
- OK.
Sinan, I'm really sorry.
Then we'll continue another time.
Efsun. Is that a horse?
Just wait. Relax.
Thank you so much.
The meeting of our lips
was wishful thinking again.
Sinan and I met two more times
after our movie night.
The first was
my Turkish-girl-trips-out day.
I acted up the whole time.
What? Don't you remember
my favorite dessert?
What kind of place is this?
It's always me who calls.
You never call, never text.
I'm picking a fight, huh?
I've been forgotten.
Can I speak for once please?
Enough.
On our second date the world was small.
We ran into Selin again.
Selin's gorgeous.
Selin has a career.
She also has an orange-peel butt.
Plus she's married
and even has a baby.
What was that?
But she's a baby, not a flowerpot.
Try holding her closer.
May fortune always smile on her.
- I'll take her.
- For those interested...
...Pissy's wedding preparations
are proceeding apace.
We're being scrubbed.
I sometimes feel like making an excuse
and getting the hell out.
The Efsun I've been for 30 years...
Is battling with
a bunch of lentil-brained girls.
If you ask why
I couldn't tell you.
I'm about to go up in steam as it is.
I strolled into the orchard
The orchard was pruned.
And a regular haunt
for the nightingale.
Young Merve was a tender 15.
Who was it who deceived her?
Is that the singer, Adile NaÅŸit?
Young Merve was a tender 15
Who was it who deceived her?
Oh my God.
It's no time to dance
from one hill to the other
I could do without losing my mind.
Efsun.
You sat there like a shrew.
Is it so hard
to join in the fun, girl?
Now, c'mon.
Last week I was in favor,
I could do nothing wrong.
And now I'm a shrew, huh?
Look, less of that sass.
I'm in a bad enough mood already.
Look at Nur HanÄ±m revel in
her daughter getting married.
Give that here.
C'mon, it's henna time.
You've messed with me enough.
All I need is henna.
- Sorry, no way.
- What do you mean?
It's the custom.
- Mom.
- Hm?
She's been acting like a kid lately.
Jealous of Merve, are you?
You can't be serious.
Look at Ãœresin and TÃ¼resin.
Poor things.
They'll never have a henna party.
Oh, Mom.
Efsun?
Don't you remember me?
I'm Burcu.
Oh, Burcu.
Of course.
How's it going?
Good.
Any wedding plans on your front?
You're seeing Sinan.
- Do you know Sinan?
- Yes.
Look, Sinan's an unbelievable catch.
Don't let him go, Efsun.
There are girls waiting to swoop.
And you're one of them.
Are you seeing anyone?
- No.
- I'm so sorry.
We're in the same boat.
How old are you?
Twenty-five. You?
I just love your hair.
I can't take my eyes off it.
- But I asked your age.
- I know. Thirty.
Well, I don't mean
to get you down, Efsun.
- But you've left it late.
- For what?
- You don't mind me saying, do you?
- No, sure.
There are 40 girls
for every guy these days.
Forty, is it?
In my day we had big discussions
about how many per square meter.
Remember, I'm 30.
Yes, but think how good it is
to be a young mom, Efsun.
To be a young mom.
OK, you're 30, right?
- Yes, 30.
- You're 30.
You start dating Sinan.
Then you get married.
A year from now.
Best-case scenario.
You want to enjoy life
for a year or two.
That makes you 33.
Then you decide to have kids.
But there's a problem.
You have to start IVF treatment.
If that takes a few years
you're up to 35-40.
- I mean.
- Ah, cuz.
I'll get upset with you.
- Why?
- You haven't been near us.
- No.
- Girls!
Ah, Ãœresin and TÃ¼resin.
Here we go.
Ãœresin, TÃ¼resin, I'm glad you came.
We've been to the grave and back.
If you'd worn that bra years before
you wouldn't be old maids.
I hear Sinan's coming to the wedding.
What? How come?
Why? Who invited him?
- Your grandmother.
- How did she get his number?
From Ceren.
How did she get it?
- From your phone.
- When?
Oh c'mon, Efsun.
You know, playing ball with them
has changed you.
OK, Dad. You're right.
When you were little...
I got you all chicks.
Ceren, TuÄŸÃ§e and you.
Remember?
Are you crazy?
Of course I remember.
Theirs grew into chickens
and mine into a rooster.
Even then you three were different.
Way back then your gran insisted
there was something odd about you.
Well, the girls played with dolls...
And I chased after you,
demanding you read some more.
And I loved
that you weren't like them.
I'll read to you again
if you like.
Oh, sweetheart.
But...
If you say no,
you'd rather play with dolls now...
That's different.
The rooster among the chickens, huh?
And now I'm trying to be a chicken.
Maybe Sinan loves you as a rooster.
How do you mean?
Then Sinan's gay.
What?
What I don't get is how I'm so stuck
on someone I haven't seen in years.
But isn't it so often the case...
That we realize our need for things
having got to know them?
Now I'm totally confused.
Fehmi and Nimet don't speak.
They can't be at the same table.
You want trouble at the wedding?
Despite that crumpled face of his
Fehmi took up with a girl of 25...
And gave Nimet the boot.
Why should Nimet sit next to him?
Then let's not ask Fehmi.
He owns half of Izmir.
We might need him some day.
Who are Nimet and Fehmi
for goodness sake?
Is that the list?
Whoa! You planned to ask 100
and now it's suddenly 500.
Having been married before
you know everything.
OK, I only said it in case
it's shameful to the groom's side.
We're a big family, Efsun.
A wedding of 100 is shameful to us.
Just as well
the wedding isn't in Izmir.
Or else the groom
would probably run away, Pissy.
We're sitting you...
...with Sinan.
Well, if you don't mind.
By the way, Peyker HanÄ±m.
I hear you called Sinan.
To ask him to the wedding.
Weddings bring people closer.
And he'll meet the family.
That's what I'm scared of.
Let him know you're no waif.
Mom, I put Efe and umm...
Who's it from, Efsun?
Sinan.
He's picking me up at 8.00.
And says to wear sports gear.
Wooh! Fantastic!
At last you're finding
things in common.
- Gran.
- So we'll have a double wedding.
Pissy's suddenly come to life.
No way.
Here we are.
This place...
It's our school, isn't it?
- All set?
- For what?
- I don't believe it.
- C'mon.
Sinan.
This way.
- Why did you bring me here?
- Wait and see.
You're unbelievable.
No way.
We're gonna play table tennis?
Careful.
You don't wanna wake Enver, do you?
Is Enver still around? Dear Enver.
What made you remember him?
You miss Enver, huh?
OK. Ready?
Are you kidding?
I haven't played since high school.
What happened?
Scared, are you?
You're unbelievable.
I thought I'd lost it.
That's because I stole it.
Let's warm up then.
What are you doing?
- You're seriously scared.
- Me? Scared?
Sorry? I didn't catch that.
Are you scared?
Don't shout.
Old Enver will hear.
You said you missed him.
May the best player win.
Maybe it's called
getting stuck in the past, but...
It's very rare for love to strike.
You're more likely
to find love...
At the sweet age of 16.
Except you don't value it then.
Or maybe aren't aware of it.
At least
that's how it was with me.
I've carried that regret in my heart
for years.
I guess I'm tired of having regrets.
Maybe this really is
my last chance.
Who's there?
Hey, who's there?
Your man.
Go give him a hug.
- Stop running!
- Enver.
I read somewhere...
- That time falls into three categories.
- Enver!
The definite past, the reported past
and the hybrid past.
Enver, we love you!
There's so much I've longed
to tell Sinan all these years.
I don't know where to start.
- Are you OK?
- Sure.
I haven't felt so good in ages.
You saw me play in there.
I'm just fine.
- Actually I--
- Efsun, I--
- You go first.
- No, you go.
I'm listening. Go on.
OK.
I was gonna say...
I was gonna say, Sinan...
Yes?
- I'm.
- You're.
- Dying.
- Dying.
I don't know how to say this but...
Dying...
To know if my gran asked you
to the wedding on Friday.
Are you gonna come?
They say don't flog a dead horse.
Nice one, Efsun.
Romanticism is beyond you?
Let's go.
Efsun, let me introduce you
to Murat's cousin, Mehmet.
Have a seat, dear.
He's a musician too.
Plays the ney or something.
Murat, wasn't it?
No, Mehmet.
Mehmet BaltacÄ±.
Sorry. I couldn't hear
above the music.
That's OK. Mehmet BaltacÄ±.
Can you hear now?
- Yes.
- Good.
You play the flute, huh?
- No. I play the ney.
- Sorry.
What do you do?
I work for a publisher.
You?
I'm a high-power banker.
I hope there's no problem?
Not if you stop fiddling around.
- May I have the honor of this dance?
- Sure. I'd love it.
Catch you later.
You dance wonderfully.
- Thanks.
- You're unbelievable.
- Thank you.
- Sublime.
- Fehmi.
- What, Nimet?
So, you're Nimet and Fehmi?
Aren't you ashamed of bringing
a 25-year-old hussy here?
Thanks for saying 25,
but "hussy" is harsh.
Stop that jazz.
- You, go to your seat.
- But you've got me wrong.
I'm Peyker's granddaughter.
Look, my mom.
- Aunt Nimet.
- Nimet.
- Recognize me now?
- Kiss my hand.
She's doing it on purpose.
That's terrible.
Efsun.
Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼?
Umm.
Shall we dance?
- Well, OK.
- Shall we?
Efsun.
In that case let's umm.
I'll request a dance tune
and then we'll dance.
You look gorgeous, young lady.
Thank you. Welcome.
- This place is free, right?
- Yes.
Sorry I'm late.
Hope I didn't miss the ceremony.
No, nothing's started.
Anyway you're here.
That's what matters.
I was astonished
when your gran asked me.
Why? Is it so abnormal?
Can't we go to a wedding together?
That's not why.
Because you didn't ask me.
Actually I...
Of course I was gonna ask you.
But my gran beat me to it.
Anyway, OK. From now on
everything will be perfect.
I've dreaded wasting happiness
since a child...
So I always save some for later.
I don't follow.
It's just something I read
by a writer I love. Forget it.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Efsun.
Precious, wasn't it you...
Who frowned on your mom
for saving the best china for guests?
Yes.
Well, why save happiness?
So I have some to show my kids
in years to come.
Look, my cousin's marrying in her 20s
and I'm still treading water.
I need a different attitude.
If I were you,
I'd put all that aside...
And try to savor the moment.
Looks like they're coming.
She's gone.
How could you suggest
signing a prenup, Murat?
How could you play with
my daughter's dignity and honor?
Nur HanÄ±m, please.
Watch your words.
- Mom, can you calm down?
- Right now I cannot be calm.
Just a second.
When are we starting?
We aren't.
Murat, why do we only
find out about this now?
Auntie Nur...
There is no prenup.
They'll be married in 10 minutes...
And he still calls me "auntie".
He calls me "old man".
I've yet to hear you say "mom", Murat.
Why would he?
Merve doesn't call me "mom".
Mom.
Auntie Nur, one second.
- Still "auntie".
- Wait, Nur.
Let the boy speak.
- Go on, son.
- Thanks.
OK, Merve and I were on the stairs.
Then Merve asked me
if I was against prenups.
So I said
they can sometimes be necessary.
But you aren't against them either.
He really hurt me.
- You don't know our family.
- No. We've no interest in money.
Thank goodness.
My love.
Wipe your eyes.
People are waiting. Don't cry.
Back off, Murat.
I'm not crying anyway.
Women are impossible to please.
You'll say, "If we're women,
you're an alkaline battery, huh?"
No. Sure, I'm a woman too, but...
I'm not as skilled as these girls
at showing off my femininity.
Could I be?
What's up?
A prenup crisis,
but it's been dealt with.
Are you in favor of prenups?
No idea.
I never thought about it.
You never think about
marriage period, Sinan.
Why do you think about it so much?
Excuse me. You mean
I'm out to find a husband?
I didn't say that.
But your every other word is marriage.
I seem to have upset you. Sorry.
Efsun, if I was upset,
why would I be here?
But shifting the subject to marriage
like other women...
- Doesn't suit you.
- Why not?
Do I give
the image of a woman...
Doomed to be single, childless
and marriage-crazy?
I don't believe it. I haven't said
a single word about marriage.
The position you've put me in now
really hurts.
OK, if I upset you all the same,
I won't say a word.
I'll keep quiet.
Efsun, I got the wrong idea.
OK.
OK, let it go.
C'mon. Don't pout.
Look, the bride's coming.
Murat's putting the house
in Merve's name.
Good for my girl.
And she has your name in big letters
on the soles of her shoes.
May your turn be next.
You don't believe in all that, do you?
Oh, she does.
When they came to ask for Merve's hand...
She swallowed the engagement ribbon.
To improve her prospects.
And look,
they've started looking up.
Experience has taught me
that life is like a pendulum...
...swinging between trepidation
and total perfection.
Just like now.
Your avoiding me and being distant.
Without you my spring is winter.
You are my absolute sweetheart.
If you knew how I love you.
Mom, the mic.
Girls!
Here goes.
All single girls, gather around.
C'mon, TuÄŸÃ§e, Ceren.
It's laughable.
They're so into it.
Let's see who's gonna catch
the bride's bouquet.
- Want some wine?
- Sure, love some.
OK, let's see those hands.
I'm throwing it.
One.
Two.
Three.
I got it!
I'll be first to marry.
You'll see.
I got it!
I'll be first to marry!
Sinan.
Sinan.
Sinan.
Sinan.
Wait, what's going on?
What happened?
Exactly, what did happen?
Nothing.
How do you mean?
Why have you changed so much?
I haven't. I still feel
the same things toward you.
I've been seeing you for a month.
One month.
I don't remember
a single conversation...
That didn't involve marriage.
Not a single one.
Have yourself a good time, OK?
See? You got the bouquet.
Please.
If you'll excuse me.
Sinan. Sinan.
Sinan, please. Just listen.
What do you have to say, Efsun?
Everything speaks for itself.
You're still holding the bouquet.
Look, whatever you're after...
Whatever you're out to get...
I hope you find it.
But count me out.
Sinan.
Sinan.
Sinan.
When did I become a hysterical girl
in search of a husband?
The thing that hurts most
about making a mistake...
Is being aware of making it.
Oh, love.
You're sweet and short.
She was now alone with
a terrific sense of melancholy.
She was a stranger...
...to her own body...
...to her home of years,
to everyone around her...
...whose voice she'd heard
and face she'd seen daily.
A deafening voice
was crying out far away.
This time it was too late.
When happiness was near
she'd failed to grasp it...
And endless bliss
now eluded her forever.
Efsun?
Are you sure you want me
to read this book?
I told you
not to play ball with them.
Mom.
Exactly, Efsun.
Honey...
I'm your mother.
You can tell me everything.
I'm fine. Great.
Seriously I'm fine.
Sure, it was kind of a shock.
But it's Sinan's choice.
What can I do?
Sinan!
Sinan, come back. Sinan!
Si... Sinan.
Has he called?
Anyone check my phone?
I think I want to die.
Pull yourself together.
You're young, pretty.
Sinan's not the only fish in the sea.
Gran, you told me a month ago
that he was my last chance.
What last chance?
Everyone should be nice
to my little peanut.
Well, all your "wisdom"
has made me a total idiot.
I know what'll do you good.
This is so good for me.
I could slit my wrists any second.
- Will you have raki?
- She will.
How many ice cubes?
Does it matter?
If it's two,
will Sinan come back?
- Just let him stew.
- But I ordered beans.
God give me strength!
Sis, somehow
you have to get Sinan back.
Why do you think I lost him?
Have you Tweeted Sinan?
Or updated your Facebook status?
Let's try to be positive.
Let's unlock our chakras.
I swear to God,
I'll unlock my rage here so bad...
You'll rise like the sun.
Cut the crap. Stop talking to me
about Facebook. Enough!
I'm saying let's sound him out
on social media.
See how he reacts.
Why?
Can't I tell him face to face...
That I love him, I'm sorry,
I made a mistake, I'm an idiot?
That's like taking
the "sad bride makes a glad wife" line.
Stop talking to me about brides!
Never use that word again.
Tell me what to text.
"I leave you a giant void
as a reminder of me."
No, I've got it.
"A woman leaves--"
No, wait.
"A woman loves
like she'll never leave..."
"But if need be
she'll leave like she never loved."
OK, this is better.
"I could've loved humanity
if I hadn't started with you."
"I love, you're loved,
I cry, you make me."
Am I a minibus driver?
Huh?
What is this?
I'm an expert on crooks,
I'm crazy for your looks.
Nothing is left of the old me.
I'm weary and tortured now.
Nothing is left of the old me.
I'm weary and tortured now.
Take me by the arm or I'll fall.
I'm alone, my friends
I'm alone, alone.
Take me by the arm.
Or I'll fall.
I'm alone, my friends
I'm alone, alone
God!
Mom.
Mom.
It's me, your daughter.
Your baby bird's back.
- What's this?
- What's what?
What?
Quiet.
You'll wake the entire building.
Hey, wake up!
You're tanked.
Get inside.
What did we drink?
You stink.
I texted Sinan.
In this state or earlier?
In this state.
No more games.
This is how I am.
Let's see.
Give that here.
- Efsun, what's this?
- What?
See ta.
See ta?
What's that?
Efsun, what are you doing?
Grab her.
God.
- Get inside, go on.
- Why should I net inside?
Efsun.
Efsun, enough.
You've been in bed all day.
Mom.
C'mon, peanut. Get ready.
Mehmet's waiting at the door.
Who's Mehmet?
Mehmet LÃ¼tfÃ¼?
Murat's cousin, Mehmet.
You sat together at the wedding.
That high-power ney-playing idiot?
He's smitten.
He's taking you for dinner.
Don't be ridiculous.
I only said get ready.
C'mon.
Get out of that bed.
See ta.
C'mon, no dawdling.
I'm not going out with that idiot.
Next month...
...I'm getting promoted at the bank.
Really?
You're full of surprises, Mehmet.
Why are you so glum and standoffish?
Me?
Excuse me,
why did you ask me out then?
I didn't.
Your mom fixed it.
She got my number from Murat.
I might have guessed.
Look, I'm sorry.
OK, let's go.
No, sit down.
It's fine.
Let me tell you right off
so it isn't a surprise.
Go on.
- I already fancy another guy.
- And I'm gay.
Seriously,
I'm in love with another guy.
And I'm telling you I'm gay.
I'm really sorry. Excuse me.
He's gay.
Listen, wench.
Are you in love with Sinan?
How did you know?
I saw how you looked at him
at the wedding.
You're kidding.
Do I make it so obvious?
Well, I noticed at least.
But you know what? He's to die for.
Oh boy!
May God let him be mine.
I'd go to that family
as a live-in bride, I swear.
But I've lost him unfortunately.
How?
Did you text him?
Of course. I suspect it was
the tackiest message ever.
Were you drunk or sober
at the time?
- What do you think?
- I see.
You know where he lives?
Sure. He's lived in the same place
for years.
But wait,
how long have you known him?
First year of high school.
You're kidding.
High-school sweethearts
reunite passionately after years.
Love, love, love.
You know what you should do?
You go to his house.
You knock on his door.
He comes to the door.
You look at him.
You grab him
by those broad shoulders.
You pin him against the wall.
- Grab his hair, spin him around.
- Mehmet.
You talk.
Just talk.
Was it something I said?
Something happened.
Did I sweat or what?
I'm all flushed. No wonder,
after all that talk of boys.
- Shall we go for ravioli?
- Seriously? If it's big on garlic.
Fuck. Let's go.
Every life has its turning points.
At any time you close one door
and open another.
Spontaneous choices
sometimes become your fate.
And you don't realize it.
That day in that library...
...my own idiocy
made me close a door...
...which put years
between Sinan and me.
Have you ever dated anyone?
Why?
Just wondering.
No.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
What's it to you?
C'mon, tell me.
No.
Shall we kiss?
You only value what you have
when it's gone.
Yes, it's a clichÃ©.
But so true.
Are you gonna let him go?
Then it's OK to spend
another 10 years missing him.
You think I should go after him?
It's time to return to the real world.
Look.
All these years
your best friend's been a ghost.
We must put an end to it.
How do you mean?
Won't I see you again?
It may be better if you don't.
How bizarre.
I feel like I've only just found you,
not like I'm losing you.
Do whatever you can
to make him forgive you.
Off you go.
Efsun, is that my fur?
Where are you going at this hour?
Efsun.
- Sinan. We need to talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.
OK, listen to my monologue.
I won't let you go.
Not until you've married me, right?
You turned out to be
a marriage freak, Efsun.
What I don't get is
how the girl I knew and loved...
How did you become like this?
Then why did you go?
Why didn't you stop me?
- Was it so hard to say stay?
- I was scared.
Scared of loving someone so much.
If you'd lost an arm
I'd have given you mine.
I loved you so much.
For 14 years I looked for you
in every guy I met.
So when you turned up...
...out of the blue,
I didn't know what to do.
OK, I know I was ridiculous.
Efsun, look at you.
- Are you happy like that?
- Happy?
Sinan, are you crazy?
Since you,
I've never been a whole person.
I've just been a shadow.
What if we hadn't met that night?
Fate brought you to me.
Otherwise I'd have carried on
with life as before.
But now I know
there's a whole new life with you.
You're saying let's get married.
Sinan, don't.
Sinan.
How can a living being
that's 70 per cent water...
...burn up so much inside?
No. I'll never let him go again.
Sinan.
