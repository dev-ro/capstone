To those who loved this world...
...and knew friendly company therein:
This Reunion is for you.
498 Years Earlier
Northern Cave
Tseng! Look at this.
Pay dirt.
Not a pretty sight, is it?
Who cares?
Just get the damn thing.
Reno, the chopper.
You got it.
Whoa!
Reno, hurry!
Reno!
Who the hell is that?
Elena!
Go! Get out!
The Lifestream.
That's what we call the river of life
that circles our planet...
...giving life to the world
and everything in it.
The Shinra Electric Power Company
discovered a way...
...to use the Lifestream
as an energy source.
Because of Shinra's energy, we were
able to live very comfortable lives.
But wasn't that because we were
taking away from the planet's life?
A lot of people thought so.
Shinra used their power to try and
stop anybody who got in their way.
Shinra had a special group
of warriors called SOLDIER.
And all the SOLDIERs
had Jenova cells put inside them.
Jenova was a calamity that fell
from the sky a long, long time ago...
...and tried to destroy the planet.
Anyway, there was one SOLDIER
named Sephiroth...
...who was better than the rest.
But when he found out about the
terrible experiments that made him...
...he began to hate Shinra.
And then, over time,
he began to hate everything.
Shinra and the people against them.
Sephiroth, who hated
the planet so much...
...he wanted to make it go away.
And the people who tried to stop him.
There were a lot of battles.
For every battle,
there was more sadness.
Someone I love went back
to the Lifestream too.
And then, it came.
The chosen day.
In the end, the planet itself had to
make the battles stop for good.
The planet used the Lifestream
as a weapon...
...and when it burst out
of the earth...
...all the fighting,
all the greed and sadness...
...everything was washed away.
"Sadness was the price
to see it end."
It's been two years
since they told me that.
But it looks like the planet
is a lot madder than we thought.
They call it geostigma.
Well, Marlene? How does it look?
Please. Please don't
take Denzel away.
He's not here anymore.
Cloud, where are you?
Strife Delivery Service.
You name it, we ship--
May I ask who's calling?
Yeah, I remember you.
You got a call from Reno.
He's in Healin.
Says he's got work for you.
Cloud, how have you been?
You have no more messages--
Hey, Kadaj?
Is that where Big Brother lives?
Yeah.
Think he'll be happy to see us?
- Not a chance.
- Don't cry, Yazoo.
But Mother's with him?
Maybe not.
Oh, don't cry, Loz.
Look, here he comes.
Where's Mother?
We know you hid her, Brother.
Don't tell me you're leading me on?
Because I think
you do have Mother there.
No need to shout.
Put the president on.
You're starting to bother me.
What up, fool, it's Barret.
I am the man!
Oil, Cloud! I just found the biggest
goddamn oil field you ever seen!
Surveying's done...
...so I should be able to get out there
and see Marlene real soon.
You let her know, all right, Spiky?
Reno called again.
He says to hurry,
but he sounded kind of strange...
Be careful, okay?
Okay, so you're good.
Yeah, Rude, looking sharp!
Good. You fight like the SOLDIER
you once claimed to be.
You haven't rusted a bit.
Rufus Shinra?
Do I feel bad for you.
- The day of the explosion...
- What do you want?
- ...I managed to get out...
- Who were the guys that attacked me?
- ...before it colla--
- I'm leaving.
We need your assistance, Cloud.
- Not interest--
- I acknowledge that Shinra...
...owes the planet a lot.
It goes without saying
that my company and I...
...are the ones who put
the world in the sorry state it's in.
So we feel we have a responsibility
to set things right.
I'm still out here!
We've already taken the first step...
...by conducting an investigation
in Sephiroth's wake.
- Yup, at the Northern Cave!
- What do you think we found?
Nothing.
Nothing at all. You can relax.
However, not all went as planned.
We were interrupted.
It was the three who attacked you.
Kadaj's gang.
Kadaj?
It seems he doesn't want us
finishing what we started.
Really, what could they be thinking?
What does that have to do with me?
You're our buddy, aren't you?
Kadaj's group is young, violent.
As dangerous as they come.
That's why we decided it might be
in our interest to hire a little muscle.
I'm a delivery boy now. Tough luck.
You're all we have.
Please, Cloud,
you're an ex-SOLDIER.
In my head.
What's this "Mother" crap about?
Why, did Kadaj
say something to you?
No surprise.
There are plenty of kids who miss their
mothers. That's the world we live in.
I hear there are orphans
living with you.
Think about it. Don't you want
to put smiles back on their faces?
All we want in the end
is to rebuild our world, Cloud.
- But I...
- Come on, Cloud.
Together, we can rebuild Shinra!
Not interested.
- Reno!
- Reno!
Does Cloud live here?
I guess he does.
What's this?
It's just like Denzel. Is Cloud sick?
Why didn't he just say something?
Did he leave because he's sick?
He wants to fight alone.
- Fight?
- No.
I don't think he will.
Tifa?
Ready, Marlene?
No! I wanna see Cloud!
I know, sweetie.
- I miss him too.
- Yeah.
So say he comes back?
We'll all go home!
But first he's getting a lecture.
Yeah!
I hate liars.
I apologize.
This time you'll get the truth.
The object you seek
fell from the helicopter...
...while we were running from you.
We were clumsy.
Is that right?
I swear it.
Then swear on these.
- Why are you doing this?
- We need Mother's power.
The Reunion is coming
and we need her.
Reunion?
My brothers and sisters who share
Mother's cells will all assemble.
And together, we'll take revenge
on the planet.
We've already sent out the invitations,
but you know.
Someone's gone and hidden
the guest of honor.
Invitations?
The stigma.
But you know all about that.
Mother's memetic legacy lives on in
the Lifestream and makes it happen.
She does so much for us, and we
don't even know where to find her.
But what can we do, we're just
remnants of Mother's legacy.
Until we find Mother and receive
her cells, we can't be whole again.
Geostigma and a legacy
aren't enough.
Not for a true Reunion.
What do you mean?
Mr. Shinra, surely you've noticed?
I said I'd live out both our lives.
Easier said than done.
You wanna be in SOLDIER?
Hang in there!
Hey, how're you doing?
What're you gonna do
once we get to Midgar?
We're friends, right?
Cloud, run!
Wanna play?
I guess that's a no.
Where's Mother?
Yuck.
- Hey, where's Mother?
- There's no one here!
Fine. Play with me.
This'll be fun.
Tifa!
She's not here.
I'm not crying!
Bring the girl. Got it.
Where were we?
Cloud...
Just run!
Just run!
You've got the stigma too?
Come on, they're gonna fix us.
Tifa?
Tifa!
Too late...
Who did this?
He didn't say.
Marlene?!
No...
You're pretty heavy.
Weren't there kids living with you?
Because they ain't here.
You don't care?
I...
You're a real handful.
So Big Brother was hiding it.
This is the power of the Lifestream.
This materia will give us
renewed power.
Reno and Rude are looking.
You have geostigma, don't you.
So it's okay to just give up and die.
Is that what you think?
It is.
There's no cure.
That's not stopping Denzel
from fighting.
Don't run. Let's fight it together.
We can help each other,
I know we can.
Or do we have to be a real family
for that to work?
Tifa...
...I'm not fit to help anyone.
Not my family, not my friends.
No one.
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally...
Dilly-dally, shilly-shally...
I think she wants you
to move on, man.
Did you find them?
Only a witness.
Kadaj's gang took the kids.
- Where are they?
- The Forgotten City.
Their base.
Mother gave me a very special gift:
The power to fight...
...against a planet
that torments its people.
She gave this gift to all her children.
That's right.
You and I are brethren.
Brothers and sisters chosen...
...when we inherited Mother's memetic
legacy through the Lifestream.
But...
...the planet doesn't like that.
It's trying to hold us back.
That's why it's been racking our bodies
with pain, filling our hearts with doubt!
I will heal you.
Then we will go to Mother.
We will join as a family
and strike back at the planet!
Do as I do.
Denzel.
Denzel!
You came.
Even though you're about to break.
That's a good sign.
So...
...why did you come?
I think I want to be forgiven.
More than anything.
By who?
Glad you could make it.
I'm here for the kids.
See this man? He's our big brother.
But alas...
...in our happy flock...
...he's what you'd call
a black sheep.
Cloud!
I was right. I'm no good to anyone.
Vincent. What do you know
about this?
I come here often.
I've seen what Kadaj's group
is doing.
The stigma.
Inside our bodies, we all have
a current like the Lifestream.
When alien matter infests the body,
this current is what fights it off.
Geostigma is what happens...
...when the body overcompensates
for its unwelcome guest.
Unwelcome guest?
The Sephiroth gene.
Jenova's memetic legacy.
Call it what you want.
You're well-informed.
Tseng and Elena.
They were brought here half-dead.
They must have been
brutally tortured.
I did what I could to save them...
...but it was ugly.
Tortured?
They had it coming.
They got their hands
on Jenova's head.
Then the "Mother"
Kadaj is looking for...
Heaven's dark harbinger.
The calamity, Jenova.
If they wanted to,
they could make another Sephiroth.
Kadaj...
What is he?
I'd rather not know.
Marlene!
Cloud! Denzel and Tifa!
Tifa is all right.
I wanna talk to her!
May I?
You don't have a phone?
Vincent, will you take Marlene
back to the bar?
I'm gonna go get some answers
from Shinra.
- You know I can't.
- But--
Forget it, Cloud!
Why don't you ever pay
any attention to us?
Marlene, please give me some time.
There's a battle to be fought...
...but it's not as simple
as just fighting it. You see?
No, I don't!
Fighting. Is that what this is about?
Where are they?
The Forgotten City.
Their base.
Can you go?
- I have to talk to Rufus.
- Stop running!
I know.
Even if you find the kids,
you might not be able to help them.
Maybe something will happen
that can never unhappen.
That scares you, doesn't it?
But you need to think about now.
Take it in.
You think you've got it hard? Tough.
Sharing your life
with other people is hard.
I know you don't want to be alone.
You might not answer the phone,
but you won't throw it away either.
You go to the base, Cloud.
Why do we have to lose out
to a memory?
But I let you die.
"Boo-hoo. Poor little me."
Cloud, why can't you
forgive yourself?
Are sins ever forgiven?
I've never tried.
What?
Tried.
Marlene, let's go home.
I'm gonna try.
I'll let you know how it goes.
It's me, Reeve.
How's work going?
I saw your flyer. How the hell
do you stay in business?
You never change, Cloud.
I was thinking about helping you out,
but I guess I'll call back another time.
- Later.
- Surprise! It's me, Yuffie.
So, hey, all the kids
are missing from Wutai.
Have you heard anything?
Give me a ring and fill me in, okay?
I never blamed you, not once.
You came for me.
That's all that matters.
- Hey, are you listening?
- Why the hell are you doing this?
Denzel?
Denzel. Denzel!
And what are we up to?
Mother's here, isn't she?
How do you figure?
This...
...monument?
I bet Shinra made it.
Now, now,
don't think yourself to death.
Besides, you're wrong.
We don't know anything about it.
As if anyone would trust you.
Say, Kadaj.
I've got a question for you.
I've got an answer.
You said you needed Jenova cells
in order to return to what you were.
What does that mean?
Him. He's coming back.
Sephiroth.
The nightmare.
So they say.
You mean...
I don't know Sephiroth.
But I know he's close.
It gets under my skin.
What if Mother loves him
more than...?
Poor little avatar.
It doesn't matter.
You'll meet the same fate either way!
Mother came to this planet
after a long journey.
To rid the cosmos of fools like you.
But you know as well as me.
Nothing's changed
since Mother came here.
I have to change it.
To make her happy.
There's nothing I wouldn't do,
if she only asked.
It's Nightmare Junior.
As long as you exist, the nightmares
will come again and again.
The Lifestream
courses through our planet...
...back and forth across
the borders of life and death.
If that cycle is the very truth of life...
...then history, too,
will inevitably repeat itself.
So go on, bring your Jenovas
and your Sephiroths.
It won't matter.
We'll do as life dictates...
...and stop you every single time.
Mr. President, is that an excuse
for taking Mother?
Don't tell me
you're feeling remorse?
Remorse?
Why, I've never had this much fun.
Good. Now let's put
an end to all this.
Denzel, we've got to get away!
Holy...
Shit.
Is it coming after us?
Why don't you go ask it?
Having fun yet?
The time of my life!
Can't you guys just call it a day?!
We will.
If you give back Mother,
that'll be the end of everything.
Damned punks...
...what do you need
Jenova's head for?
Forget your little Reunion
and get a grip!
All we want is to be with Mother!
Mother will know what's best.
She'll tell us what to do.
Now, where is she?
Mother, shmother.
It's Jenova's frigging head!
- Hey!
- Don't talk about Mother like that.
You meanie!
We're sorry.
Yeah, sorry...
What the hell am I saying!
Tifa?
You are dead!
You look after Mom.
Barret!
Marlene's okay, ain't she?
Jings, crivvens!
All right, I wanna know
who's been using my materia!
The bad guys, naturally.
Ooh!
Who's that?
The latest model.
Say hello to the Shera!
Where can I buy a phone?
Who's he?
These are our friends.
Marlene's safe. I took her home.
It's easier now.
I was ready to drag myself along
until there was nothing left.
I'm going back to the bar.
I'll be waiting with Marlene.
You're gonna come home,
right, Cloud?
Take your damn time!
Isn't this fun, Mr. President?
What should we summon next?
- Mother?
- A good son would have known.
Alley-oop!
Yee-haw!
Up and away!
Fly!
No giving up!
Go.
Mother!
- Boss!
- Boss!
Hey, partner.
This thing got any bite?
Shinra technology at its finest.
Oh, so you made this.
If nothing else, it's flashy.
Oh-hoh!
You like flashy, right?
No overtime tonight, eh?
Mother!
Mother...
Mother!
Let's go, Cloud.
I've finally found Mother.
So, what happens now?
Mother will tell me, you'll see.
I guess avatars don't get the memo.
So what if I'm a puppet.
You used to be no different!
Cloud, I brought you materia!
- Geez, careful!
- Yo, Cid! Land this junk heap.
Shut up! You want off, you jump!
Let Cloud fight his own battle.
Kadaj is an avatar of Sephiroth.
Think of him as
a sort of larval form.
Larva? You mean
he's some kinda insect?
Haud yer wheesht, lassie.
So that punk's gonna
become Sephiroth?
Wait, Cloud, does he know that?
Probably.
Then you're right.
This is his fight.
Someone explain what's going on!
This is man talk.
Sexist. Sexist!
Wheesht, lassie, shut yer geggie!
Some of the men
ain't following either.
During our last battle
two years ago...
...do you remember
what it was like to be strong?
It's only been two years...
...but somehow that strength
has slipped away.
I think Cloud's found it
again though.
I'll give him 10 minutes.
That's Cloud. Pain in the ass.
You said it.
Welcome to my Reunion.
It's been a long time, Cloud.
Your geostigma is gone?
What a shame.
Sephiroth, what do you want?
The ghosts of geostigma victims.
They will rejoin the Lifestream
and circle the planet...
...and in time corrode it.
What I want, Cloud...
...is to sail the darkness of the cosmos
with this planet as my vessel...
...just as my mother did long ago.
Then one day we'll find
a new planet...
...and on its soil we'll create
a shining future.
What about this planet?
Well, that's up to you.
It's her.
Where did you find this strength?
I don't feel like telling you.
I've thought of
a wonderful present for you.
Shall I give you despair?
Kneel. Beg for forgiveness.
What do you treasure most?
I want the joy of taking it from you.
How sad.
You don't understand at all.
There is nothing I don't treasure!
Stay in my memories
where you belong.
I will never be a memory.
Brother...
Kadaj?
You can let it go now, if you want.
Mother, is that you...?
Everyone's waiting,
if you're ready to go.
Yeah! And stay down!
- Shit, what'd I tell you?
- Aye, yer a douchty fighter, Cloud!
You just have to put your mind to it.
Hang on to yer britches, folks!
You never left us, did you?
Thank you.
We all go together...
And together, we can play...
Cloud!
Cloud said he'd come home.
Mom?
Why does everyone
keep calling me that?
I guess they must be fond of you.
I think this one's outgrown me.
Tough luck, friend.
Looks like your place isn't here.
She said to wait here for Cloud.
Welcome home.
Thanks.
There are still children
with the stigma.
Okay, it's time to get fixed up.
It's okay.
Be strong.
- Last one in is a rotten egg!
- It worked, it worked!
Everything's fine now.
Yeah. I'm not alone.
