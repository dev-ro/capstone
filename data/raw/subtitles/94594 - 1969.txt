In 1969,
Rlchard Nlxon was Inaugurated presldent... 
... Bobby Kennedy and Martln Luther Klng
had been assasslnated the year before... 
... and the Beatles were stlll together. 
Ralph and I were 19.
Two years out of hlgh school, 
and we owned the world. 
At least, the 83-mlle stretch
from Barton State College home. 
You know what freedom is?
Okay, I'll tell you what freedom is.
Standing on the road
with your thumb out...
...you got no cares,
no problems in your life.
You can go anywhere in the world.
- I want to go home.
- That's one place you can go.
Douche bag! Go to hell!
I hope your tongue falls out.
Thank you. Thanks a lot, you scum!
You slug! Thanks a lot, you fucking mold!
- I told my mother I'd be there by dinner.
- It's gonna be a late dinner.
All we need is a ride, Ralph.
Then we'll be home, I promise.
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
Something funny?
Give us a ride, you mother-humper!
Give us a ride!
Hey, Scott! Scottie!
Eat this! There you go.
We should have stayed at college.
We could've gotten laid.
No, you could've gotten laid.
I've already decided,
if nothing happens by the time I'm 20...
...I'm gonna cut it off.
How you gonna pee?
Sitting down.
You think that's funny?
You've slept with 13 girls, Ralph.
Fourteen.
You slept with that girl
with the thingies in her hair?
When? Last night?
Shit!
You want to get laid, man?
I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna show you how easy it is.
The next car that comes down that road
is gonna be the woman of your dreams.
Come on. Look human.
Look human, okay?
What do you want her to look like?
I mean, name your requirements.
- Alive and from this planet.
- Okay.
Look, look. Here she comes.
What's she like? Is she blonde, brunette?
Has she got big boppers, little boppers?
Come on, come on.
She's blonde, blonde.
Strawberry blonde, actually.
She's 28 years old.
She wants a younger man.
She wants it. She wants it real bad.
Not bad enough to stop for us, though.
- Shit! Did you see her face?
- She's beautiful.
She wants you.
Why do you think she stopped?
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Ralph.
I'm ready. I've been practicing.
Hey, is something awfully funny?
No, no, I just thought
you were someone else.
Well, I'm not, I'm just me.
Sorry. Would you still like a lift,
or am I too much of a disappointment?
- No, no, that'd be great.
- Thanks.
"Let the sun shine
"Let the sun shine in
"The sun shine in
"Let the sun shine"
You got enough room?
Yeah. Thanks.
You're big, aren't you?
How big are you?
About six even.
Really? Is that hard or soft?
Hey, mister.
Marshall. Call me Marshall.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend.
"Let the sun shine in, let the sun shine"
- Can I see it?
- What?
I'll show you mine.
You can let us out here.
This is as far as we wanted to go.
You don't have to be rude.
It's my car. I can do whatever I want.
No one touches my friend,
you fucking homo!
Sorry! I didn't know you were married!
At least we got
a little farther down the road.
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
We're gonna need it.
"And on the third day,
He rose again from the dead.
"And His countenance was like lightning,
and His raiment..."
"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.
"I am with you always,
even to the end of the world."
Hey, Ralph! What's happening?
Well, if it isn't Jesus Christ
and Mary Magdalene.
Hi.
Hi, Ralph! How are you?
It's good to see you, wild boy.
Look at you. You look horrible.
How you doing, Dad?
What brings you girls down here?
Little brother.
Hi, Cottie. Alden, are you a mailman?
Yeah.
Here. I got a special delivery for you,
right there.
Look at you two.
Can hardly tell us apart.
How are you doing, Bethany Willow?
Why can't you just call me Beth?
So you jerks took a shortcut.
I was about to call out the National Guard.
You should've.
We could have used the ride.
Look at you. I wouldn't have
picked you up with a dump truck.
The '60s hadn't really hlt yet
In our Ilttle town In Maryland... 
... even though they were almost over. 
I mean that In the sense
that nothlng much had changed. 
Not In my Ilfetlme, anyway. 
Hi, puppy.
What, do I live by myself here?
Anyone gonna join me for dinner?
Not you.
Here you are, Happy.
Go on.
Kids, it's Easter Sunday, for Christ's sake.
Gonna rake the yard before you go back?
No. I've got to study.
- You're gonna rake the yard, aren't you?
- On Easter Sunday? Wrong.
Come on. Cut it out.
Don't do that!
Okay.
- Peace.
- Peace.
Mercy?
Stop it! Goddamn it, stop it!
Close your eyes while I pray for you.
Dear Lord...
Amen.
Go get 'em, Alden!
Scottie?
How's it going?
Super.
I like your hair.
- Yeah, I like yours, too.
- Yeah?
- The superintendent's, huh?
- Yeah.
It's hard to imagine Dad
ever being young like us.
Yeah, well,
he might have been young like you.
He was never young like me.
When he was my age,
he was already married and had me.
He was in a hurry to get old.
That's not my trip.
I keep trying to picture myself
getting out...
...and getting married...
...having a real job...
...but...
...I just can't see it.
So how's your love life? You getting any?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I been doing that a long time now.
- No shit?
- I didn't get laid till I was almost 20.
- Really?
- That's a drag.
- Yeah.
I guess I was on a slow trip.
Come here.
Get down here.
What do you think of my car?
- It's okay.
- Yeah? Tell me the truth.
It's a piece of shit, Alden.
Well, it's yours.
I don't want it.
Well, I'm giving it to you, Scott.
I don't want your car, Alden.
Look, you can trade it in
on something else then.
- That's okay. I like hitchhiking.
- Then park the car and hitchhike.
Look, I'm trying to be nice to you.
Trying to make up for being a prick
to me all my life?
Scott, you're my only brother.
You know,
you might have everybody impressed.
You come in here like some big hero...
...in your little uniform
and your little boy's haircut.
I don't buy it for a minute.
You haven't said a goddamn word to me
in three years.
You're only being nice to me 'cause
you're chickenshit about going to Vietnam.
Shut up!
Alden!
Scottie!
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Just getting to know each other.
I was wondering if I could have that.
Yeah, sure.
You must be really proud of your brother.
Yeah, you want to come with me?
Shoot a few Cong?
No, it's not my war. I don't care about it.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
It's bullshit.
Apologize to your brother.
I'm sorry that it's bullshit.
It doesn't matter, Dad.
Everyone's entitled to his own opinion.
Not that kind of opinion.
We should get going.
I was thinking we could
throw the football around.
The three of us.
You know.
Call Ralph.
Have a little fun.
I don't think we've got time, Dad.
You go ahead. I'm not coming.
- What are you talking about? Come on.
- I have to run before it gets dark.
It might rain.
You exercise too much, Jessie.
You're gonna give us all a complex.
Just trying to catch up.
You folks go. You'll miss the bus.
Aren't you gonna say good-bye to me?
Marsha!
- You be careful over there, hotshot.
- I will.
Don't you pick up anything
you can't put down.
Ralph, I'll see you.
Send us a postcard from the Mekong Delta.
Yeah, I will.
Come here.
Listen, I don't know about the war...
...because they don't give you
a lot of time to think about it.
But you're right.
I'm a little scared.
So...
Let's go. It's time.
Bye, Alden.
I'll see you, Dad.
You give 'em hell, Butch.
You look like you could use a hug.
Don't die.
Don't die!
Don't die!
Bye-bye.
Those who have graduated... 
... you've got 3 weeks to report
to your local board. 
We need volunteers to march
In Washlngton... 
Thls Is our dream. 
A beautlful, beautlful glrl. 
Klnd of glrl you'd dle for... 
...or even marry. 
Are you Ilstenlng to me? 
You paying attention?
Yes.
Who are we talking about?
You know who Aldonza is?
You don't even know who she is, do you?
Okay. Don Quixote...
He's going off to fight the windmills
with his faithful friend Sancho.
He meets a beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful girl.
That's Aldonza. They fall in love...
You haven't even read this, have you?
I read part of it.
It's got a lot of pages.
- Where'd you get that?
- I had it from before. I made it last.
- Can I have a puff?
- Puff?
You mean a hit.
A hit. A hit.
What are you doing?
- That's mine!
- Thanks, man.
I know you!
- Why'd you do that?
- I'm saving your life.
Why did we come to college?
To have fun,
which I'm not having right now.
No. To not get drafted.
That's why we came to college.
You want to go to Vietnam
and get your face shot off?
Not particularly.
- Are you trying to make me paranoid?
- No.
What are you gonna do
when you flunk out and get drafted?
- I'm not gonna get drafted.
- No?
Good.
I heard a story about this guy
who went in for his physical, right?
Put a candy bar up his ass.
And the doctor says, "What is that?"
And he says:
"That's shit, Doc."
Did he get out?
Yeah, they don't want any
shit eaters in the army.
Okay, Ralph, you know,
I don't have to help you.
But let me tell you something.
If you flunk out and die in Vietnam...
...that's the end of our friendship.
Fuck you, you know?
I got a girl for you out here.
Is he driving a white Edsel?
No, it is a beautiful girl.
She's walking along all by herself.
Real poetic.
She's coming this way. She's really cute.
She looks like Katherine Ross...
...or a cross between
Katherine Ross and my sister.
That's not bad.
Why don't you come down here?
Show her your weenie.
- Hey, beautiful girl!
- Hey, baby, up here!
- Shit!
- It is my sister!
Fuck!
Hey, Beth!
I don't know
what you want to come to State for.
- You're too smart.
- It looks so exciting.
It does?
- Why, you don't want me to come here?
- I didn't say that. Did I say that?
Here come my little brats!
Oh, my God, look at you two!
Big dog. How are you, buddy?
How you doing?
- Did this one tell you?
- No. What?
Salutatorian.
Do you know what that means, Ralph?
- No, I don't know what that means.
- What does it mean? She studies, you!
What are these clothes?
Is this what I'm paying for?
No. I got dressed up
'cause I knew you were coming.
You little doggie. You little rat boy.
You give your mother a big hug
before I spank you.
- Mom, what are you doing here?
- I just came along for the ride.
Here, I brought you something.
- Cookies.
- Yeah.
Mom, I'm 19 years old.
This isn't summer camp.
I just thought I'd bring you something.
Sorry.
I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Guess I don't have to worry about you.
- No, I don't think so.
Come on, you playboys.
You gonna take us old broads to lunch?
- You want some cookies?
- Here.
I'll take you to the vomitorium, and you
can see what you've been paying for.
What's all this?
Your basic antiwar
touch football demonstration.
I just want to ask three questions,
then you can go back to sleep.
One: Why are we in Vietnam?
Two: How many of you sweet-faced
mothers' sons are dying to find out?
And three:
What are you gonna do about it?
- Take the building!
- Yeah!
Beth!
- Get over here!
- Stop it!
Shit!
Let's get out of here!
Stop!
- That's my daughter, you idiot!
- Stop it!
Shit, man! Let him go!
Police brutality!
Mom!
But she's my friend!
Get out of my way!
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it! No!
Stop it!
Beth, it's all right.
Sweetheart! My God, are you all right?
Stupid, stupid cops.
Stupid cops!
Man, that was fun!
We fought in the revolution, man.
You know what freedom is?
School's out.
You put your brains away for the summer.
You're grooving along in your own car,
even if it is a piece of shit.
Wind's in your hair.
You see a hitchhiker. You stop!
You pick the mother-humper up.
Hop in!
We're not homosexuals or anything!
I have been waiting here almost an hour!
That's nothing, man.
It took me and my buddy here two days
once to go 83 miles. Isn't that right?
Yep. Now we're making up for lost time.
Did you ever take Driver's Ed?
A car is an expression of one's psyche.
I got a fucked-up psyche.
Don't worry about it.
Hop in.
Where you going?
Well, I wasn't going anywhere.
Is there anywhere you want to go?
I guess I can go up to Baylor
and see my sister.
You got it.
"Wlth hlt news as It's happenlng."
Here's a look at the headllnes
for Saturday, June 14th. 
Presldent Nlxon, meetlng on Mldway
wlth Vletnamese presldent Thleu... 
... says our boys In Southeast Asla
are comlng home. 
All right! Yeah!
Thank you! Thank you, Lord!
Thank you, Mr. Nixon.
That's bullshit!
If we're coming home...
...how come I'm going over?
I got a brother over there.
I just got a postcard from him.
See?
He says it's not bad if you like the jungle
and don't mind getting shot at.
Knowing my brother,
he's probably taken over the whole place...
...tellin' everybody what to do,
including the Vietcong.
You know, I read somewhere
your chances of getting killed in Vietnam...
...are less than your chances
of dying in a car crash.
Would you shut up?
Shut the fucking hell up!
- What?
- Please.
I'm sorry.
- She don't like the way you're driving.
- What?
- You're scaring her.
- You're kidding me.
Yeah. You're driving like a maniac!
Shit! Why didn't you say something?
You drive.
Lordy.
Maybe you could slow down to
100 or something.
- Yeah.
- Ralph! Slow down!
Ralph, stop the fucking car now!
- Get out!
- Let me out.
Get out! I'll drive.
- Here. Come on.
- What'd I do?
- What'd I do?
- You all right?
Thanks for the ride.
- Good luck over there.
- Thanks.
There's somethlng wrong In Amerlca. 
I don't know what It Is, but I'm scared. 
There's somethlng wrong when
everybody's mad at everybody else. 
There's somethlng wrong when we don't
understand what our country's dolng. 
When we were Ilttle klds, 
and too young to understand... 
... John Kennedy sald, 
"Ask what you can do for your country."
And whom are we supposed to ask now? 
Presldent Nlxon? 
Hear, hear!
Does he know? Does he care? 
No!
A few weeks ago, down at Barton State... 
... there was a flght
about the war In Vletnam. 
And thls boy fell agalnst me, bleedlng. 
And now, Ilke Lady Macbeth, 
I can't seem to get the blood off. 
- Try using Ajax.
-It's not funnyl
My nelghbor's over there. 
He Is my frlend. I don't want hlm to dle. 
My other frlends could go, 
or my own brotherl
And for what, to wln? 
Is that wlnnlng, when hundreds
of Amerlcan boys dle week after week? 
If I were a boy, I wouldn't want to go dle
for somethlng that makes people so angry. 
Would you? 
We already have bombs enough
to destroy every organlsm on thls planet. 
Where wlll we be flve years from now? 
Or 20 years from now? 
We are supposed to be the future. 
Thls Is our country. What can we do? 
All right, Betho!
What's that?
Lucy In the Sky Wlth Dlamonds. 
Take it. It's acid.
- No.
- Come on.
We'll get some high-school graduates,
and we'll ball 'em.
You only got three months
till you cut off your weenie.
- Take the fucking pill!
- No!
I took it.
I took it.
- I can't believe you sometimes.
- Come on, I don't want to trip alone.
Great. Some friend you are.
You growing up or something?
Maybe.
You did good.
- Thanks. Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.
Excuse me, miss.
Coach, how are you?
I just wanted to say good-bye
before you got run out of town.
Probably woke up some
zombies around here.
What about this kid?
- Very interesting. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Beth, it was a lovely speech.
You made me cry, and you made me think.
And you! You look like a fortune teller.
- How you doing, Dad?
- How'd your finals go?
Finals. I knew I forgot something.
I saw you.
You aren't working at the pool
this summer?
No, we're going on the road.
That's what hippies do.
You gotta live life while you've got it.
Did you see me?
Yeah.
I'm trading in Alden's car for a van.
We're just gonna groove.
What's your brother gonna say about that?
He'll probably freak out and kill someone...
...'cause he won't try to understand,
the same as you.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Hi, honey. How are you?
What is it I'm supposed to understand?
Me, Dad. Fucking me!
Watch your mouth.
Well, Jessie, I guess I'm just like you now.
Our babies have left the nest.
We taught them how to fly,
and they flew.
Ralph Carr. 
Class of '67. Flve-tlme varslty letterman. 
Graduated 158th... 
... In hls class of 161 or somethlng. 
Thank you. 
My slster Beth got all the bralns
In the famlly, but... 
... I'm ugly, so It all works out. 
I dldn't mean to flunk out, It just happened. 
- He flunked out? Did he?
- I don't know.
So... 
Hey, mister, I want to talk to you.
What are you doing? Are you crazy, Ralph?
Ralph, what are you doing?
Come on.
Ralph!
No! Don't!
Stop!
Ralph! Ralph!
- Did he flunk out, Scott?
- I don't know.
Keep him still.
Did you flunk out?
- Everybody be quiet.
- Clear the gymnasium.
Everybody outside, please.
Ralph, sweetheart.
- What's going on? What is this?
- Is he on something, Scottie?
LSD.
- You guys are on drugs?
- Is this the first time he's taken any?
- Maybe, I don't know.
- You jerk!
- I don't believe this.
- Cliff, stop it!
Come on, Cliff!
What? What is it?
- I think we'd better get him to the hospital.
- No!
- You're not gonna take my baby away.
- Come on, Mom.
Let him go, Mom.
Cliff, would you bring Ev, please?
- Is he gonna be all right?
- I think so.
What's going on?
Goddamn it, Cliff. You owe me a hug.
This is us. The leaves in the trees!
Most people are mushrooms or toadstools
or worms or something.
But we're leaves, you know, in the sky...
...above all the roots, the dirt, the dog doo.
You get it? You know, us, leaves.
Like the Beatles, Bob Dylan.
- The Rolling Stones, of course.
- Yeah. They are cool cats.
Yeah.
Probably Kurt Vonnegut.
Beckett.
- Camus.
- Camus, yeah!
Yeah, definitely a cool cat.
Who is he? I forgot.
- He was a writer.
- Yeah. Right. I remember.
God! I read everything
that sucker ever wrote.
Yeah, so...
Who else, man?
The Kennedy brothers,
even though they're dead.
Definitely leaves, especially Bobby.
And...
...probably Eugene McCarthy...
...Carlos Castaneda, Eldridge Cleaver.
Yeah, yeah. And what about the Beaver?
And what about Wally?
Or no, he's kind of like a root,
I guess, right?
Probably a carrot.
Eddie Haskell would be basically...
...dog shit.
Am I right?
Yeah. You're feeling better, huh?
Yeah. I think so.
You wanna go play around
in the sand dunes?
No, thanks.
Come on, Ralph, what do you say?
Come on.
You sure you're all right?
I'm great, I'm groovy.
Would you leave me alone?
You sure?
I OD'd one time...
...I accidentally flunked out of college,
that doesn't make me retarded.
I don't need a baby-sitter.
You go play in the goddamn sand dunes!
Okay. I'm sorry, okay?
See you later.
Does my nudity make you uncomfortable?
No, no.
Me, actually, I'm a little nervous
about getting sunburned.
Our friend Ralph here loves to
take his clothes off in public, though.
I do?
- That's right, you weren't there.
- Yeah, I was tripping.
Would you like to trip now?
No, thanks, no. I'm trying to cut down.
- You know, we're gonna change the world.
- You and me?
No, all of us. People are gonna
look back on 1969 and say:
"That's the year everything changed.
"Got rid of all that shit:
"Prejudice, fighting, poverty, disease."
They'll say it was a year of miracles.
Scott Denny got laid.
Maybe.
- Ralph Carr got drafted, died in Vietnam.
- What's the matter with you?
- Why are you such a bummer?
- I did drugs.
I'm brain-damaged.
Better un-damage yourself.
This is our summer, man.
It's the last summer of innocence.
It's the summer of the leaves, you know.
The wind will pick us up
and take us wherever we want.
So where do you want to go, Ralph?
Maybe we should go home?
You know, my mother worries about me.
You are so weird.
It's not just that.
Maybe we should think about getting jobs.
Jobs?
We're leaves, Ralph.
Leaves don't need money.
We have naked people giving us free food.
Look, maybe I'm not a leaf, okay?
Maybe I'm a rabbit or something.
I was thinking that I might go home.
You don't have to take me. I'll hitchhike.
They might be looking for me.
- Who?
- The draft board.
They're not gonna find you here.
Ralph, I'm not gonna ever
let them draft you, okay?
I mean,
you don't have to worry about that.
Hey, guys.
Just kidding.
All right. Home sweet home,
motherfucker! Hi, Marsha.
- Hi, Ralph!
- Hey, Marsha.
Marsha, give me a balloon here.
Here, Happy.
Hi. I'm back!
"Dreamin' in the night"
Scottie.
Hey, Beth.
Scott!
Scottie!
Hi, sweetheart.
- How are you? How you doin'?
- Good.
- Where's your partner?
- He's out doing Amerlcan Bandstand.
- Great. Go on. Cream your dad.
- I will.
Look who it is. My gypsy son.
- Get tired of the Crusades?
- No, we missed our moms.
And as soon as you do your laundry,
you're going back on the road. Right?
Maybe.
What's going on? What's wrong?
They...
...seem to have misplaced your brother.
- What?
- Missing in action.
Okay.
Now, if anybody comes, take the van.
You get the hell out of here,
you promise me?
No.
Look, it's not your problem.
There's no reason for you to get in trouble.
Let's go.
- What are we gonna do now?
- Window.
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- Mlsslon: Imposslble.
- Jesus!
- Fuck!
Here. Would you hold this, please?
You don't want to be an accomplice?
You're already standing in shit.
I'll write a note saying you're innocent.
Breaking and entering a federal building,
that's real innocent.
You have any better ideas?
No.
"1949. Aberon, Lawrence Michael."
You remember him?
Guy who had teeth like this?
Remember him?
"Albertson, Arnett...
"...Austin...
"...Caminski." Shit.
"Carr. Ralph Maurice Carr."
Everything about me.
This is embarrassing.
"Process notification."
What the hell does that mean?
It means Uncle Sam wants you.
Too bad.
"D... Denny.
"Scott Clifton Denny."
- I don't want it. Forget it.
- Why?
Your number's gonna come up, too.
You can't stay in college forever.
You'll wind up like your brother!
I don't want it! Put it back!
What the hell do you think
you're gonna do with yours, anyway?
I'm gonna feed it to the dog,
and then I'll feed him yours.
- No, that's not gonna work, man.
- Yes, it is.
No.
My whole life, you've been saving my ass.
Now I'm gonna save yours.
Ralph, they're gonna know we took them.
We'll be the only ones missing.
No. We'll be missing.
We won't exist anymore. Get it?
All right. We'll burn this place down.
Give me the lighter.
Give me that lighter.
- You can't do that!
- Give me the goddamn lighter!
I ain't gonna let you die.
- Give it to me! It's my lighter!
- Get the fuck away from me!
Don't piss me off.
You just pissed me off! It's mine!
- How come you're not at the pool?
- I was looking for my dog.
- You lose your dog?
- Yeah.
- She lost her dog.
- You want us to help you find him?
It's okay. I can find him.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Happy! Come here, boy.
Somebody's down there.
- You got the keys?
- Yeah.
Shit!
Come on. We got to get out of here.
You don't have to clean up! Let's go!
- Go!
- You go!
Go, asshole!
- Shit!
- Fuck!
- Do you see anything?
- No.
- What's going on here?
- We heard someone, but they got away.
Goddamn it.
Who's in there?
It's Ralph Carr.
Hi, Ralph. It's Junior Roberts.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What are you doing with my son, Junior?
Let him go.
He was poking around in his draft papers.
What? What ails you, Ralph?
What is the matter with you? Goddamn it!
I didn't want to go to Vietnam.
- Why? Why?
- Cliff.
I don't even know what it's about.
- Where is Scott?
- I'm right here.
- Hey, Scottie.
- I was with him, Junior.
He's lying. He wasn't in there.
I was, too. My folder's on top of the desk.
You see any other stuff in there?
He's trying to protect my brother.
He was in the van the whole time.
- Arrest him.
- What are you saying?
His brother is over there
risking his life for our country.
- We don't even know if he's...
- He's dead!
- Scottie.
- What did you say?
- He's not dead.
- He's missing. That means he's dead.
Liar!
You are a goddamn liar!
- Daddy!
- Don't keep pushing me!
They're good boys, Cliff,
Alden and the rest of them.
My own boy, you know, he'll never be
the same after being over there.
We all just better think about it some.
Mrs. Denny. Mrs. Carr.
You're no longer welcome in my home.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't take it personally, okay?
- Come on.
- Okay?
Beth, let's go.
- No, I want to stay.
- Get in the car right now.
Come on, Happy. Get in the car.
Sorry, pal.
It was fun, man.
Remember those 14 girls
I told you I balled?
I lied about 10 of them.
And two of them were really bad news,
but the other two...
Wow.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I thought you might be out here.
- Yeah.
How's life in the real world?
Fine. My mother's drunk.
Your parents aren't speaking.
Thank God things are back to normal.
God, that was pretty wild today.
Bonnie and Clyde ride again.
Yeah.
Beth.
It's okay.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Gotta get the hell out of this town.
I could go with you.
- Thanks, kid.
- I'm not a kid.
I think you're really beautiful, Scott.
You're the most beautiful person
I've ever known.
Yeah, well, you haven't really been
outside of Culloch County.
What about me?
I think you're really nice, Beth.
I meant...
...do you think I'm beautiful or anything?
Yeah.
You know so much.
You're so good, pure, and...
Shut up!
I'm not talking about my mind.
My mind is just getting out of its cage.
What am I, like, rat girl?
No.
You're a lot prettier than I thought.
You're very pretty, Beth.
You're beautiful, okay?
You could tell me about all the stuff, about
the leaves and everything if you want.
No, it's...
It's just a stupid idea I had.
Actually, it's not that stupid.
It's just that some people understand.
Some people don't.
Or you could make love to me.
The LEM foot pads are only... 
... depressed In the surface
about one or two Inches. 
Although the surface appears to be... 
... very flne-gralned as you get close to It. 
It's almost Ilke a powder down there, 
It's very flne. 
Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now. 
Roger, we copy. Pretty good Ilttle jump. 
Hon!
-That's one small step for a man... 
- On the moon!
...one glant leap for manklnd. 
What's all this?
It's just stuff.
It was in the refrigerator and now it's not.
It's my goddamn mess,
I'll clean it up.
I think I might go for a walk.
Will you be okay?
I was thinking that I could wake up
in the middle of the night...
...and I could hear
my three little men snoring away.
You with your cute little
whisper of a snore.
And Alden with his deviated septum
sounding like a horse.
And Scottie all intense and impatient.
And I'd think:
"Who are these people?
"I mean, this is an insane asylum."
But I couldn't sleep
until I heard all three of you.
Now I never sleep.
I walk down the hallway...
...listen at your door.
I don't hear anything.
Don't you sleep?
I just hope Alden isn't suffering.
I'd rather he be dead than suffering.
- We can't lose hope.
- Yes, we can.
It's our hope.
We can lose it if we goddamn want.
Are you mad at me?
No.
I don't seem to feel anything.
Magnlflcent slght out here. 
Magnlflcent desolatlon. 
God bless you, Neil, Buzzy.
God bless you, kid.
Beth!
Happy is not happy!
Who's out there?
Cliff? That you?
What are you doing up so late?
You want to come in?
You shouldn't drink so much.
You should drink more.
Come on, relax, Cliff.
It's the Age of Aquarius.
Come on.
I see them!
I see them on the moon!
Here's a plcture of
the Presldent of the Unlted States. 
Scottie. You scared me.
Your father's not here.
I'm sorry about Dad.
I'm sorry, too.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's a sorry time.
I don't have to leave.
I can stick around if you want me to.
No, you go. You go.
That's what I'd do if I could.
I'd get far away from here, where it's safe.
- You go, you hear?
- Okay.
Get going.
I don't have to worry about you.
Ralph.
Hey, Ralpho.
- One hundred.
- Ralph, Beth's here.
- What are you doing?
- Pushups. He does them all the time.
Yeah, gotta stay in shape
so I can kill in the name of democracy.
They probably won't take you now.
You're a criminal.
You'll have to go into politics
or something.
Yeah. My pal, Scott Shakespeare,
he's got a joke for every occasion.
You got a problem,
he'll write a poem about it.
Ralph, what is the matter with you?
I wanna go.
Get it over with. To hell with it.
How's Mom?
She's okay. She's gonna come see you.
Yeah? When do you think?
Around Christmas?
I'm really starting to feel unpopular here.
You folks are gonna have to get going.
Ralph, I was thinking of
going back on the road.
If that's okay with you.
- With me?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Great. Groovy.
I mean, I'd be pissed off if you didn't go.
Beth's going with me.
Did you ball my sister?
Is that it?
This guy balled my sister!
- You fuck!
- All right. Come on.
Get him out of here.
He's no friend of mine.
Ralph.
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Are we in a hurry or something?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
To Canada.
Come on. Come on, boy.
Hi.
Where are we?
Either heaven or Maine.
I'm too tired to know.
Pretty, huh? So that's Canada.
It doesn't look that bad.
I'm not going with you, Scott.
What?
It's not over there.
It's inside of us, or it doesn't exist at all.
I don't want to run away.
Okay.
Fine.
You're not gonna get drafted and die
for something that nobody believes in.
No. Fuck you!
If you died, I would die, too.
My father died when I was 11 years old.
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.
I want you to stay with me and fight!
We have to make people understand
that it's wrong.
You folks crossing over?
You could have just gone.
It's a free country.
Come on.
Come on!
Alden Palmer Denny...
...is the first boy from Culloch County
to die in Vietnam.
Let us wish him Godspeed and peace...
...and pray that he'll be the last. Amen.
Amen.
I said something to my brother one time.
That this wasn't my war.
I guess I was wrong.
It's everybody's war.
I'm sorry, Alden.
My father over there
has got medals in his closet...
...to prove that he fought in a good war.
And I'm proud of my father...
...even though
he doesn't like me right now.
I don't believe that this is a good war.
That's all Ralph was trying to say.
That's all my brother ended up saying, too.
It seems there's really nothing
you can do about it, though.
I mean, that's what you hear on the news.
It's just the way it is.
You can disagree!
You can say that it's not right!
That's what freedom is!
I'm going down to the courthouse now
to try and get my friend out of jail.
And I guess you're just gonna have
to shoot me, Junior, but it's a protest!
A protest against this.
Anybody who would like
to come with me...
...you can.
Get the hell off the road!
Hey, man.
In November of '69... 
... 327 of us from Culloch County... 
... Includlng my father, 
marched In Washlngton... 
... along wlth 700,000 other Amerlcans
to protest the war In Vletnam. 
Thls fllm Is dedlcated to all of us,
