It's loose.
Chill, I'm not done.
Would I let Boss down?
It's true.
My brother only trusts you.
Right.
He tells me "left", I go left.
He tells me "right", I go right.
Why doesn't he trust me?
Like "lefty-loosey,
righty-tighty".
Your left may not be his left.
Your right may not be his right.
Busy talking?
Let's move, one to each car.
Get going!
HEY
The guy my brother trusts.
Yeah?
He wants you to join him.
Okay.
Go ahead.
They drove off in three taxis
with bombs in each one.
Where did they go?
Unsure.
Two Toyotas, one Nissan.
"DB 2436"
"FA 969"
Why does my brother trust him, not me?
I don't trust him at all.
Peng Hong is very cautious
I don't know his plan yet.
Stay in touch.
He made three car bombs.
All three are taxis.
There are over 20,000 taxis in Hong Kong.
Here are the license plate numbers.
Have a drink, let's celebrate first.
We lost the GPS signal of JS.
Keep tracking.
Have you located the three taxis?
Not yet, sir.
We'll be rich!
Hey! Stop there!
All Units,
Heung To Bank Gold Vault is being attacked.
Sir, Heung To Bank is being attacked.
All units, take action.
Yes, sir.
Bring another cart.
It smells great.
Don't lose them.
Crash into him... Go ahead.
Fun, JS?
Slow down...
- Let them catch up.
- Yes.
Let them catch up.
They're coming.
Brother, did you see that?
I did it.
Calling Control. Officer down.
Hurry.
All units, stop.
Do not enter the car park.
Beware of car bombs.
Go around to block them.
What the heck?
Stop.
Put your gun down.
Put your gun down
I order you to put your gun down.
- Police.
- Put your gun down.
Put down your weapons, freeze
I said, put your gun down.
Get out of the car.
Hands up.
- Turn that way.
- Stop.
Set him free, he is our man.
My elder brother will come and save me.
Traitor.
He will never stop hunting you down.
- He definitely will come to save me.
- Take him away.
He won't let you off the hook.
They entered the pedestrian tunnel
Roger, we'll go block them from the front.
Scumbag.
Scumbag.
Sir, a bomb!
Listen up.
Please put your cell phones in the locker
together with any flash drives
or lighters.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Plastic explosives,
as its name implies,
can be formed into different shapes,
making them difficult to be detected.
Even x-ray machines cannot detect them.
One kind of plastic explosives is.
Composition C-4.
Its power of damage is greater than TNT.
Its explosive velocity
can be up to 8km per second.
This is a dummy of the American-made model.
MKII fragmentation-type hand grenade.
It weighs 600 grams
and is filled with 6O grams of TNT.
It has a safety pin inside.
If I pull it out and let go.
The striker spring
will bump against the detonator inside
ignition will occur,
the grenade will explode
in a delay of 3.2 to 4 seconds
with a lethal range of 3 meters.
Yes.
If the hand grenade is held in hand
with the safety pin removed
then the grenade will not explode, correct?
Correct.
But I am curious.
Why wouldn't you let it go?
It's not a girl's hand.
But in case you're so unfortunate
to be holding a hand grenade
without a safety pin.
Remember
you must hold on to it like a girl's hand.
Don't let go so easily.
Thank you.
We, the Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit,
work in teams of two during operations.
This is Superintendent JS Cheung.
He is Bomb Disposal Number One.
As Number Two,
my job is to assist Number One to complete
the mission as safely
and quickly as possible.
If a hand grenade lands in front of me
but it doesn't explode after 4 seconds
what shall I do?
You should thank God
and run away.
No, it should be
run first, and then thank God.
Officer Cheung.
Today is your lucky day.
Every day is my lucky day
I like more academic girls.
Hello.
My handbag was just here.
Give it back to me.
Sweetie, we didn't take your handbag.
My ID card, money, everything is inside.
It's very important
I understand, but I really didn't take it.
Then where is my handbag?
Go look somewhere else.
Stop.
Boys and girls, attention please.
If anyone finds a yellow handbag...
Officer Cheung, maybe you
should take her away.
You can't drink until you're 18.
Show me your ID card.
Are you going there?
Who is she?
Officer Cheung from EOD brought her here.
Is he from Anti-vice?
Why would he bring a drunken whore here?
How would I know?
Officer Cheung, she's coming to.
Please be kind.
Don't call her a drunken whore.
Sorry, sir.
You were so excited
you forgot I am in the chat group too.
She is drunk
but not a whore.
Diameter: 14 (inches)
Length: 44 (inches)
It's a war-time aerial
bomb filled with TNT.
Model number M64.
With a nose fuse.
Standard weight is 500 pounds.
This device can destroy a tank.
That's true.
And it's very unstable.
Immediately evacuate nearby residents.
Expand lockdown area to 100 meters.
Yes, sir.
Everyone, please stand back a bit.
Don't obstruct police from working.
Officer Cheung, your tools.
Thank you.
Officer Cheung.
Will you put on the EOD suit?
You said it could destroy a tank
so, why bother?
Ben, I will drill the nose fuse now
Roger
Ben
I've injected Type 3
fuse coagulant into it.
The fuse should be stabilized
lam starting to remove the fuse
Roger.
Don't be chicken, it is stable
I'm not going back to HQ.
Tell the boss.
After my vacation, I'll
go see him with my report.
Yes, sir.
Thank you
I must go.
Bye, Officer Cheung.
Bye.
Boys and girls, please behave.
- Come here.
- Miss Li.
Don't play on the road.
It's very dangerous.
Good girl.
Come.
Let me give you a "like".
Thank you.
Daddy.
Bye.
Where we go playing?
Are you a parent?
Hello, Miss Li.
Bye.
Do you come to file a complaint against me?
Miss Li.
Bye.
How come you know I teach here?
I forgot to tell you I'm a cop.
Officer.
Miss.
My name is JS Cheung.
Officer Cheung.
If those parents found out
I got stinking drunk in a bar
and was brought to a police station
I don't know what they'll do
I'm normally not like that.
You don't have to tell me
I really don't mind
I've been separated for six months
and just signed the divorce papers
I went to the bar just to drown my sorrows.
Then I wanted to see
if I still "got it".
You can just let me off up ahead.
It's okay.
Where are you going?
I have time to give you a ride.
No, thanks
I don't want to...
But I do.
No
I don't want to get
involved with a taken man
I'm not.
You don't believe me?
In tonight's mission,
an undercover officer helped us
raid an armed robbery organization.
We arrested two suspects.
We have issued
a bounty of HK$5 million
for the arrest of the other suspects
I will wire $50 million
in to your Cayman account.
After I get the money
in a month's time my team will have
trickled into Hong Kong.
And now, our EOD bomb disposal expert.
Superintendent JS Cheung, please.
Please say a few words, Officer Cheung.
Many people ask why I joined EOD
including my girlfriend
I told her a story.
It's called <Belling the Cat>
Long ago, a group of mice
wanted a way to go out of
their hole to find food
without being eaten by the cat outside.
Finally they had an idea:
Hang a bell on the cat.
Every time they hear the bell
they would stay in the
hole, and all will be well.
But the question was
which mouse should hang the bell?
As they were discussing that,
a little mouse raised his hand
and said, "I'll go".
Everyone was curious:
"Why you?"
The little mouse said
in its heart.
Righteousness takes priority over life.
Therefore I chose to be this mouse.
Bomb disposal is not something
you can just do.
It is divine providence
lam very grateful to God
for letting me make
the right choices in every mission
lam very grateful to God
for allowing me to use my life
to protect others' lives.
Hey, girlfriend.
Do I look good dressing up in uniform?
It's okay.
You still look like a bomb disposal expert.
Officer Cheung.
They don't serve coffee.
Drink this instead.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Congratulations, Officer Chung.
- JS.
Congratulations.
Today you've finally waited long...
What was that?
I was talking gibberish.
Stop that crap.
Let's drink to a pretty woman first.
Officer Cheung seldom brings girlfriend.
What is your name?
Carmen.
It's Miss Li.
She's a teacher.
A teacher!
Yes.
A match made in heaven.
Of course.
In any case, congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.
- Congrats to Officer Cheung.
- Cheers.
How long have you known each other?
About a year.
You've been tight-lipped
I was afraid you'd steal her
I'll drop by in a few days.
Great
I'll cook some special dishes for you.
Bye, Carmen.
Bye-bye.
Let's go.
Oh my God!
It's Officer Chow's car.
Fire!
Here is the report.
It is C-4 explosive.
The initial estimate is that
the bomb was attached by magnet to the car.
But it was not a time bomb
nor triggered by starting the engine
but by short-distance remote control.
The killer was at the site.
At least not far away.
He wanted to watch Officer
Chow's car explode.
We think the motive was revenge.
When I was undercover back then.
Officer Chow was my handler.
At first, he wanted me
for the UC assignment
but Hong was famous for explosives
so he found you in EOD.
Peng Hong.
Well
I'll get him caught.
If it's really Peng Hong.
He'll will come for you anyway.
You took my place back then
I must ensure your safety now
I'll assign 24-hour protection for you
I can take care of myself.
Yes.
All right
I'm on my way.
Hello?
(Beware of Bomb)
lam so sorry...
It's very dangerous here.
Please leave the premises now.
Excuse us, please leave the premises now.
Attention, all units.
Evacuate everyone now...
No one is allowed to enter the blockade.
Attention all units...
Evacuate...
Run! Get out!
Evacuate, go.
Keep moving, everyone leave.
Allow the fire trucks in...
Mercury detonator, how creative.
Use the electronic x-ray machine.
Yes, sir.
This is the primer.
This square should be C-4.
Not suitable for on-site neutralization.
It is a timed Improvised Explosive Device
of very high lethality.
When will it explode?
The timer is blocked
I cannot see it well.
Any plan?
Go closer to get a better look.
Officer Kong, I am now
going to examine the IED
I'm handing on-site command
to Number Two, Ben.
Power on.
Here are the tools.
Gum?
How filthy.
Hurry.
It will blow up soon.
One-thousand-one.
One-thousand-two.
One-thousand-three
Ben,
I estimate the IED will
explode in 10 minutes.
It may be dangerous to move it
I'll take care of it now
I will coagulate the mercury
with low temperature
to stop the explosion.
Prepare the liquid nitrogen.
Yes, sir.
Liquid nitrogen, now.
Now.
Attention all units
100% evacuation is mandatory.
There's someone up there. EOD suspend.
Officer Cheung, suspend action.
Trespassers on site
I'll wait.
Hurry up.
It will blow soon.
We're hereto shoot the bomb.
Out of the way.
Get out of here.
EOD, confirm
evacuation is complete.
Officer Cheung, evacuation complete.
Good job.
But it's not over yet.
Clear
Roger.
Officer Kong, the device has been disarmed.
Do not remove the blockade
until further notice
CSI colleagues, you may
begin to gather evidence.
If you put a time bomb here
what time would you set it at?
Of course at lunchtime.
Why?
There are most people here at lunchtime.
The bastard who put it there
would want to create the most casualty.
But it isn't crowded at the time
the bomb was set.
Thank you.
Who called the police?
A man called the police.
All he said was.
"There's a bomb in the
Gloucester Road Garden."
He may have set the bomb.
Calling Officer Kong.
Hazardous object at the
courthouse front door.
Allow me.
C-4, at least three pounds of it.
The circuitry is very complicated.
If it explodes
all the glass in the nearby
buildings will shatter.
How much longer until it explodes?
Three minutes.
There's still time.
- Let's go.
- Officer Kong.
Bomb, make way.
Make way, now!
Give it to me.
Let's go.
It's my first time drifting
with a bomb in my arms.
Will it blow when it's shaken hard?
No.
C-4 is very stable.
It won't blow even when shot at
I've drive faster, then.
Sit tight.
Go!
Make way.
Get out of the way.
Wait.
- Wait.
- What's up?
- Wait.
- There's no time.
- Wait...
- Let's go.
Wait.
Wait a moment.
Ready?
Hurry!
Okay?
Yes.
Run!
You wanted a picture to post on Facebook?
As a souvenir.
Are you nuts?
Two bomb threats in a row.
He is provoking the Police.
We've found out the call to the police
was made from a phone booth at the Garden.
Both bombs and the murder of Officer Chow
look to be the work of one person
I suspect it is the fugitive Peng Hong
I worked with him for two years.
Knowing his personality.
For sure, there should be more to come.
About the bomb discovery case yesterday
I have made it first priority for my men
to crack the case as soon as possible.
The Police never allow anyone
to undermine the security of Hong Kong.
You didn't sleep?
I dozed off for a while.
Sleep some more
I go make you breakfast
wake you up when it's ready.
You're up?
I am making you breakfast in bed.
Let me help.
You'll cook??
Egg (bomb) disposal expert
I've watched a lot of superhero movies.
Girlfriends of superheroes
never end up well.
That's right.
It's a hard life.
Sorry.
You know I've just divorced
I don't want to walk out from one nightmare
into another one
I've thought about that for you.
Why don't we...
just let it go?
Great.
We can still be friends.
Like this? Or ordinary friends?
Ordinary friends.
Okay, I'll leave after breakfast.
Do you still want breakfast in bed?
Come...
Don't miss the laser beams.
Ready 1, 2, 3.
Lily, are you having a good time?
Very much so.
Told you.
We're not those shopping tours, and
have lots of time for taking photos.
Thank you.
That's my job to make you happy.
Mr. Chan, did you take your medicine?
I was having such a good time
I forgot to take my medicine.
Get in the bus. I'll get you some water.
You're so nice.
You're most welcome.
We'll cross the harbor
and go back to the hotel now.
Okay...
Let's go, Chuen.
Sit tight...
Mr. Chiu.
Yes.
Let's go to my friend's
bar on Hong Kong side
and watch the game there.
My son will treat this evening.
Great.
We're all retirees.
You have a job, so you pay.
Thank you.
You're welcome
Uncle Chiu.
What do you think?
I wish I had a son like you.
Let me see.
You heard that?
What are you doing?
No need to ask.
It must be my birthday gift, right?
No.
- Thank you, son.
- It's not.
Mr. Au.
An accident just happened
inside the Tunnel.
We will now close the Kowloon-bound tube.
My boss just told me.
There's been a problem inside this Tunnel.
So they will use the
one-tube-two-way operation.
You can imagine.
You have two nostrils, one is stuffed up.
Of course it won't go as freely as usual.
Sorry that we have to spend some time here.
Traffic jam again?
It's early, we have plenty of time.
There are three cross-harbor
tunnels in Hong Kong.
This Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the Eastern
and the Western Harbour Crossings.
It's cheapest to take Cross-Harbour Tunnel.
The Eastern Harbour
Crossing is more expensive.
But the most expensive is
the Western Harbour Crossing.
It is so expensive
we call it the Tycoons' Tunnel.
Finally we're inside the Tunnel.
We'll be there soon.
Everybody enjoys the trip
I'm in place.
COPY
Block the Tunnel.
COPY
Who taught you how to drive?
Sit still.
Get back in your car.
Nothing serious.
Go.
Go.
Get out of the car.
Go.
- What's going on?
- Let's go.
Stay in your car.
Back in your car, now.
Don't move.
The Tunnel has been blocked.
They all have guns.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I said, get back in the bus!
- Where are you going?
- Sorry...
Sorry.
He don't (doesn't) speak English.
He don't talk (doesn't speak) English.
Get him back in the bus now.
Okay...
Back to the bus.
What's going on?
Get in the bus.
Get in the bus.
Get back in the car.
What's going on?
What's up?
Don't you move.
Don't think about it.
Get back in your cars.
Be quiet...
I said, get back in the car.
Stay in that car.
Put your hands on the wheel.
This is retired police officer 58698
lam trapped in the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.
There are dozens of armed men.
- Their motive is still unclear.
- They're coming.
Phone.
And yours?
Phone.
Hurry.
Come on... Mobile.
Listen carefully.
My name is Blast
I have hundreds of hostages here
and lots of explosives.
Look at me...
Look here.
Your turn, look at me.
How are you?
Come on, say "Cheese".
Look at the camera, look at me.
They are putting something
on the emergency doors.
Emergency call service
has received dozens of calls.
The telecommunications company has verified
that all are come from
the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.
A retired police officer
also called
we believe that he has become a hostage.
The man in charge called himself "Blast".
We are not sure yet
if he is the suspect of Officer Chow case
or the Wanchai explosion case
I suspect the container truck accident in
another side of the
Tunnel is part of the pot.
The driver is Au Kam Keung.
His record is clean.
He is a delivery guy.
But the order was made under a false name.
Sir.
Sir, this way please
I am CIP Regional Crime Unit YW Kong.
This is Senior Assistant
Chief of Police HF Wan.
We request this office
as our Command Center
and want to meet with your engineers.
Wait here for my command.
Yes, Officer Cheung.
Nothing much is happening for now.
- Lam.
- Yes
send the draft to the papers, be quick.
We have some terrifying and terrible news.
There has been reported
terrorists attack here
behind me in the Kowloon Tunnel...
Sorry, sir.
Camera Two.
Zoom in for a closer look.
That's him, Peng Hong.
That could be plastic explosives.
He's showing it to us on purpose
before he destroyed the
surveillance cameras.
The Cross-Harbour Tunnel
was built using the caisson method
and made up of 15 double-tube segments.
Its total length is 1.86km.
Between the two vehicle tubes
is an engineering tube for maintenance.
Along the Tunnel there
are 15 emergency doors
that connect the two vehicle tubes
ls there a drainage system or
air vent that we can use for an attack?
There are hundreds of hostages inside.
Their safety
is our first priority.
Officer Kong
someone just ran out from
the tube on the right.
Who are they?
Our colleagues in Maintenance.
They must have been hiding
in the engineering tube.
Go... Let's go...
Move out! Let's go!
Get back in the car...
Watch out.
Go...
Clear out.
All units, cover Officer Kong.
Officer Kong, get in the car.
Drive, hurry.
Hold fire, back off.
This is Police Commander HF Wan
I want to talk to Blast
I am Blast.
We need to talk.
You're in no position to negotiate with me
I have hundreds of hostages here.
What do you want'?
You have a bomb disposal expert, right?
His badge number is 63489
I will only talk to him.
About 15 minutes ago
at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel toll plaza
there was an intense gunfight and
an explosion suspected to
be caused by terrorists.
As of now, we don't have
any figure on casualties
but I just saw several bloodied policemen.
(Be careful)
Police do not deny
it may be the work of terrorists.
We don't know exactly
what they are aiming for.
There are numerous armed
policemen ready for combat.
(I believe you can)
Don't move.
All these years
I've thought of you every single day.
And you?
Did you think of me every day?
Surprisingly, we meet here.
Why did you change your name to Blast?
People like us
always rush about or around
must change their names sometimes
I've forgotten my original name
Robin Hood.
That's a good name.
Easy to remember.
Let's go.
Stand here.
Don't move.
You owe me too much.
You must help this time.
Kill him.
Halt.
Stand still.
Stand still.
No, please.
No.
- I beg you, no.
- 1
I beg you.
- No.
- 2

Officer Wan, it sounds
like gunshots inside.
You wanted to arrest me,
now you want to kill me'?
Let me go see.
Stay calm.
If they find out we're all cops
it will be all over.
What do you want'?
I tell you.
There is 1,EKG of C-4 explosives here.
Go out and tell those dogs
I want the Government buy back
the Western Harbour Crossing
within the next 48 hours.
Otherwise, I will kill the hostages
and blow up this Tunnel
I have no time for jokes
I will tell them your request
after you release the hostages.
What are you talking about?
You come in empty-handed
I didn't get anything
and you ask me to release the hostages?
I'll stay.
So what?
Look around, many hostages
died because of you.
It was you
who brought my brother into jail.
It's time for you
to bring my brother back to me now
for a family reunion.
Well
I'll bring your brother here
then you release 100 hostages
women and children
I promise you
I want to see Biao
before 12 o'clock.
If not
I will kill one hostage every ten minutes.
Work started on this Tunnel in 1969.
At the time, the cost
was about $300 million.
But building a tunnel at
the same location today
we believe the cost will
be several billion dollars.
But if they...
Any reply from Authority?
Continue.
If they really blow up this Tunnel
after the explosion
Victoria Harbour will
become extremely muddied.
It takes at least six
months for the mud and dust
to settle back to the bottom of the sea.
Assuming there is no navigation
by water at that time.
If they really blow up the Tunnel
it will cause at least
hundreds of billions in financial losses
over the next several years
ls there any study of
how much damage this Tunnel can sustain?
Most structures in Hong Kong can
withstand earthquakes of magnitude 6.
But if the Tunnel was
under highest explosives
the case would be different.
C-4 is a high-grade military explosive
containing Hexogen.
If its power is concentrated
1kg can blow up a five-storey building
1 mom...
is enough to blow up the whole Tunnel.
Officer Wan.
There is a website called
"Robin Hood Actions"
it has uploaded hundreds of photos.
These three are retired colleagues of ours.
This police office has just gone off-duty.
They are father and son.
Peng Hong is heartless.
He can never be Robin Hood.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
For the safety of the hostages.
The Security Bureau
has confirmed to release Biao Hong.
Due to the concern that
the two Harbour Crossings
may become the next target.
Police have shut them down now.
EOD officers with accoutrements
have entered the Tunnels for surveillance.
Currently, all three cross-harbor tunnels
are closed to all traffic
except police vehicles.
Because of the nature of the event,
the MTR will run through the night tonight.
Officer Kong.
Our staff is escorting
Biao Hong coming out.
He's very quiet.
He doesn't like to talk.
He loves to stay in
his cell alone at his free time.
A year ago he found religion.
It's been a long time.
Let's talk inside.
At least tell me where we're going.
Your elder brother is back.
Your brother has seized
the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.
He says he will release
100 hostages if he sees you
I don't want to see him.
I...
I'm sorry...
Sorry.
Sorry
I really don't want to see him.
Yes
I did many bad things
I deserve this punishment
I admit that.
But now I've changed
I'm not who I was before
I've become a better person now
I've learned many things
I don't want to see him
I cannot see him
I'm afraid to see him
I beg you
I beg you, please don't bring me to see him
I know..
My life for 100 hostages,
I...
Yes?
Officer Wan.
Our vehicle was hit
by a drunk truck driver.
An officer is badly hurt.
And Biao Hong?
Biao Hong is also hurt.
He must go to hospital.
Delay Peng Hong.
Speak.
The pick-up of Biao Hong was held up
I don't speak to peons.
Get JS Cheung to speak to me.
There's been a car accident on our end.
Your brother is badly hurt
I must send him to hospital, understand?
I am telling you.
Dead or alive.
If I don't see Biao by 12 o'clock
I will kill hostages.
Go to hospital.
Bring him out.
Come out.
Officer Wan, someone is
coming out of the Tunnel.
Don't shoot...
No.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
No...
In ten minutes, if I don't see Biao
I'll kill the next one.
They've killed a hostage.
Bring Biao Hong immediately.
Lift him up
1,2,3
Move back, go.
Two more minutes.
Biao Hong is here.
He said, Biao Hong is here.
Peng Hong.
Your brother is here.
Get going.
Okay.
Get out.
Go!
Don't shoot
I'm a hostage.
- I'm a hostage.
- Hold on.
He wants to Facetime with
the man in the ambulance.
Officer Wan, we've checked him out.
Nothing suspicious.
Release the hostages now.
Get out.
What are you doing?
We're letting you go.
Can you let my wife go too?
Only you can go.
Daddy“.
- Get out.
- Sit tight.
- Be brave.
- Don't take my dad!
Mind your own business.
Go.
Go this way.
Go this way.
Now we can see
dozens of hostages have been released.
The police on site
are leading them out of the blockade.
The hostages are trickling
out of the tunnel.
No hurry.
One by one
47, 48
Officer Wan, he's only
released 50 hostages.
That's not enough.
All young men.
Look at me.
Peng Hong.
You promised to let 100 hostages go.
You bring Biao in alone
and I'll release 50 more.
Come and help.
Come here.
Biao.
Biao.
Hang in there
I'll get you out soon.
Let the hostages go.
Release 50 hostages.
You may 90
I'll contact you.

I'll give you money, please let me go.
Please...

No, I must stay and take care of them.
- Go.
- Please let me do my job.
Please! It's my duty.
Get out.
Get out.
Where will you take him?
Go.
Come out.
Go.
Keep going.
- Hurry.
- Don't look back.
Hurry.
It has been three hours since
the Tunnel Hostage Incident began.
The police are revealing
very limited information
in order to protect the
safety of the hostages.
Some people have discovered a website
called "Robin Hood Actions"
that has uploaded photos
of possible hostages.
Some family members are
at the police station.
Let's look at the Kowloon
entrance of the Tunnel.
Yes
lam very happy to be reunited
with my brother
I will let go one more hostage for you.
Don't shoot.
He's one of us
I have a bomb tied to me.
Everyone, freeze.
Stand still
lam JS Cheung of EOD
I am UI 19472.
Don't worry.
The timer isn't on.
Stay calm.
Very calm
I'll keep that for you.
EOD
support Officer Cheung.
Yes, sir.
Officer Cheung.
Is it hard to disarm?
Don't worry
I'll do my best
I've been professionally trained.
You can tell me anything directly.
Wait for your orders here.
There are four groups of explosives on you.
So there are 16 different combinations.
That means I must out 8 wires
and they all must be the correct ones.
Officer Cheung.
Flashlight
I'll start now.
Yes.
You're quite calm.
My dad taught me
not to be afraid of anything.
He's a policeman too.
He taught me to have courage in everything.
Officer Cheung, the timer has started.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Is it hard to disarm?
How can this be?
Is it hard to disarm?
Ben.
Retreat 50 meters.
Officer Cheung, there's not enough time.
Yes, sir.
- Retreat?
- All units, fall bk 50 meters.
Everyone back up 50 meters, now!
Hurry! Retreat 50 meters.
How can I help you?
Or shall I just stand?
Move back!
Everyone stays calm.
The cars at the entrance
are full of gasoline.
Have the Fire Brigade on standby
lam very calm now.
How can I help?
I...
Officer Cheung, must go.
Out of time now!
I'm very calm
I'm fine.
How much time is left?
How many wires?
Hurry...
I beg you.
Save me please, I beg you.
Please hurry...
You are a policeman.
You have responsibilities.
Stay away from people.
Don't go near cars.
Stay where you are
to minimize casualties.
Understood?
You are a policeman.
You have responsibilities.
Stay away from people.
Don't go near cars.
Stay where you are to minimize casualties.
Understood?
Yes, sir.
Do you know, you are a policeman?
Yes, sir.
Do you know your responsibilities?
Tell me, what are your responsibilities?
Say it
lam a policeman.
My responsibilities are
to stay away from cars
stay away from people
to minimize casualties
lam a policeman.
Stay away from people.
Stay away from cars
to minimize casualties.
That day, I watched as
you arrested my brother.
Now you know how helpless I was,
how hopeless I felt.
Officer Wan.
A grief counselor has been sent here.
Tell him to leave.
Take him away
I said, "Go away"
I don't have any mental problem.
Why would I need a psychiatrist?
I've seen Psychiatrist before.
It doesn't help
I understand.
What do you understand?
Since Peng Hong escaped
I had nightmares every night
of my men being killed by bombs.
Recently I've dreamed of Officer Chow.
Do me a favor.
Keep it to yourself
I don't want to be an "office" Officer yet.
What a narrow escape!
Don't forget to buy a lottery ticket.
Officer.
Excuse me, I need to piss so badly.
- On our way, sit down first.
- I can't head it anymore
I must go now.
What are you doing?
Freeze.
Head down.
Get down.
Sit down! Don't look!
Everybody down!
Yes.
Thank you.
Something's happened to
the bus with the hostages.
Those scumbags are mixed with the hostages
3 injured policemen are on the way
to Accident & Emergency.
They are preparing to retreat.
They may have other arrangements.
Can we quit dragging our feet?
Take action!
Besides the hostage issue.
We still have to confirm
the location of the 1,000kg of C-4.
Those explosives
could be in one of the trucks.
Or both
I think Blast used the trucks
to block both the entrances on purpose
because C-4 has directionality.
If both sides explode at the same time,
the power of the explosion is pointing to
the middle of the Tunnel
when two shock waves collide.
There is a good chance the
Tunnel will break apart.
Interpol has responded.
The photo we sent to them two days ago
of the bomb Officer Cheung took in Wanchai,
has a similar design to the device
used by terrorists to attack a bar
in Djakarta last year.
Intelligence shows that.
Peng Hong had been in the Golden Triangle
delivering morphine and
heroin for drug dealers.
He has a crew of mercenaries.
Who cares about the
faraway Golden Triangle.
Let's deal with the
Cross-Harbour Tunnel first.
Sorry, Sir.
Before sunrise, try your
best to lift the ban
of both the Eastern and
Western Harbour Crossings.
Otherwise, when morning rush starts
Hong Kong will be in disorder.
Have some water.
Take your death offerings.
Take your death offerings.
The Cross-Harbour Tunnel Hostage Incident
is in its tenth hour.
As yet there is no sign of resolution.
As we can see on screen
the police have reopened
the other two Harbour Crossings
but roadblocks have been set up
at all entrances.
All vehicles going into the Crossings
must go through the surveillance.
Buy back?
The market value of my company's tunnel
is estimated to be about $10 billion.
If you want to fully acquire
all the shares in the market
and get it done within 48 hours.
The only way is to buy at any cost.
If the share price of Man Chung
shows extraordinary movement
would you apply to the
SFC to suspend trading?
Why would I suspend trading?
As the Chairman of Man Chung
my top priority is my
shareholders' benefits.
And besides
this would be good bullish news.
Of course.
Mr. Yim, you are the biggest shareholder.
Would your benefits
be your top priority?
If Man Chung's share prices rise sharply
and you'll look to sell
a great deal of stocks
please notify the police
as soon as possible.
If the Government is determined to buy back
I also hope to find out
as soon as possible
Chet Sook.
This morning the five
major securities firms
have issued many At-Auction Orders
and buying back Man Chung
shares at high prices.
Since the market opened,
Man Chung's share price has soared.
Let's take a closer look into the case.
Obviously, the Tunnel Incident
has a great influence on the market.
Man Chung owns the Western
Harbour Crosssing
and the Cross-Harbour
Tunnel is being attacked
the traffic flow at Western Harbour Cross.
Even if the market has a strong
reactioning is increasing significantly
to catch up with the stock of Man Chung
it would be quite normal.
Last night, some colleagues
were already planning
to start stocking up.
Look at the trading volume this morning.
There should be lots of speculative trades
for the prices to soar in that way.
So in your judgment
will the SFC demands a
suspension of trading?
This is just a one-off incident.
The SFC can only demand
an explanation from Man Chung.
They have no right to suspend its trading.
Give it to me.
It's worthless.
Sir
take mine, it's new.
Take my watch.
Give it to me.
This watch is for you.
Why are you giving a watch...
to someone who does not have time?
You have plenty of time.
Some of my men
have left last night
along with the hostages.
They will arrange
helicopters to pick us up.
What if we can't leave?
If we really can't leave
I'll blow up this Tunnel.
Brother.
Stop that.
Turn yourself in, please
I went through so much to get you out
hoping to have a reunion.
That's what you wanted.
Do you care about my needs?
Since childhood, you just
think of what you want.
We did whatever you wished.
What about me?
Have you ever asked what I want?
I don't want to go with you
I just want to go to hospital.
Do you know what you're saying?
You are my only brother.
Dead or alive.
You must stay with me.
It's a must.
Peng Hong...
You go to hell
lam not leaving with you.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell.
Go to hell...
Save them...
At 3PM today.
Some families of the
Tunnel Incident victims
are petitioning at the
Central Government Offices
to demand the immediate
rescue of the hostages.
As the Police are behaving passively
it is believed the government
is helpless in this matter.
Affected by this incident
the Hong Kong stock market
has taken a downturn.
The Hang Seng Index had
dropped about 1,000 points.
But the day's turnover
had reached a record-breaking $16 billion
40% of which was from the
trading of Man Chung.
Man Chung is the owner
of the Western Harbour Crossing.
Man Chung bucked the
trend and soared today.
When the market closed,
the stock soared nearly four times.
Hello?
Boss, when will I get my money?
I will wire the final $500
million to you tonight.
But
I would like to have the stock price
to go up even harder.
Officer Wan.
Blast has posted a message.
He said if we don't cooperate
they will kill hostages
and even blow up the whole Tunnel.
If you're calling for Carmen
this is Carmen.
Please leave a message after the beep.
It's me
I'm just calling to say hello.
Your girlfriend
looks
so graceful and elegant.
Where is she?
In Hong Kong.
Do you remember how good
I was to you before
and what had you done in return?
What do you want'?
I want you to remember for
the rest of your life
how you betrayed your brothers.
On the day we robbed the bank vault.
My men and I taught you
how to make a car bomb
and put them in three taxis.
You, such a dedicated traitor
must have told your bosses
the three license plate numbers.
Do you still remember
those numbers?
Hello?
Hello!

Officer.
What happened?
Here's what happened:
The taxi driver stopped his car
and ran off
I thought he went to the restroom
but he still hasn't come back.
Sir.
Sir.
Thank you.
Freeze.
Don't move.
Calling control
hand grenade was found
in Shek Mun gas station.
Keep at least 100 meters
away from the gas station.
Prepare me a sand bag trench.
Evacuate everyone nearby.
No problem.
What happened?
I will out your wrist and ankle straps
and take you away from the gas station.
Hold tight onto the grenade.
Don't let go and you'll be fine.
Understand?
Do you understand?
You will be safe.
Hold tight.
Let go.
You're fine.
Be brave
I'll get you out of this.
When they are ready
I will go with you.
Together, we will put the grenade
in the sand bag trench
and run.
Are you clear'?
I can't do this.
You can if you trust me.
You can if you trust me.
The trench is ready.
We will do it together.
Can I really do it?
Trust me.
But what if?
Do you have anything to say to me?
What do you want me to say?
Those words that women want to hear
I will take the tape off
I will count:1, 2, 3.
Release the grenade and we'll run.
Is that clear?
All right

3, let go.
Run.
We must find another way
instead of waiting.
Watch for the right moment and make a move.
This is Day 3 of the
Tunnel Hostage Incident.
Per "Robin Hood Actions",
the website probably
set up by the criminals, the ultimate goal
of the criminals is the Government
buy-back of the Man Chung-owned
Western Harbour Crossing.
- Or they will blow up this Tunnel.
- Thanks for your hard work...
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Yim...
Sorry but I have no statement to make.
Has any authority mentioned to you
about the buy-back of the
Western Harbour Crossing?
Sorry, no comment.
Mr. Yim, in this hostage crisis
how much blood money did you make?
Which paper are you represented?
I am a legitimate businessman.
You know I can sue you for libel.
Mr. Secretary.
It is said the government
has bought back numerous
shares of Man Chung through
five investment banks.
How would you respond to that?
Mr. Secretary, please respond.
Thank you
I doubt about the source of these rumors.
And I have nothing to comment
regarding those issues.
Once again I state.
The government will not
yield to any vicious power.
Looking at the trades
yesterday and this morning.
Man Chung's market value has hit 20
30 billion.
If one had invested in its derivatives
the returns would be incredible!
Here is a new job for you.
You will be all right
I have to go back to the scene now.
Wait for me to come back.
Okay
I wait for your return
and tell me those words.
Alright. I have to go.
Take care of her for me.
Yes, sir
ls your girlfriend okay?
She's fine.
Any new plan?
For me, I definitely would
make a strong assault.
You must think I am insane.
Don't shoot.
- Please don't shoot.
- Come out
Robin Hood says,
wire $1 billion more to his account.
What?
Hurry UP.
Do you need another shot?
Don't, please.
Done.
Banked into your account already.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Are you ready?
Yes, the choppers are coming.
Copy.
General, we are setting off in an hour.
When you enter the uncontrolled airspace,
my men will take care of you.
Copy.
They are coming to pick us up.
You'll see hot nurses soon.
It's Blast.
Officer Cheung.
This is the remote detonator
for the whole Tunnel.
In 60 minutes
it will blow out.
In 20 minutes
two helicopters will pick us up.
If you try to stop us
I will kill the hostages.
As long as we safely leave
Hong Kong air space
I will
switch off the remote.
But when we board the helicopter
I must take a few hostages with me
and one of them
is you.
JS Cheung.
Island units, stand by.
Island units copy.
Freeze.
Move...
Back off.
Drop the remote.

Scum.
Continue to evacuate the hostages.
You shot my leg, so I shot yours.
Get down.
Bastard
I'll kill you, traitor to your brothers
I was never your brother.
You are a thief
I'm a cop.
Even if I died ten times over
I would still arrest you.
Traitor.
I'll kill you today.
If I cannot get away
I will take you out with me.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out, scumbag.
Come out!
Come out!
- Scumbag.

Scumbag.
Stop.
Freeze.
We are running out of time.
The remote has been destroyed.

Yes, they are the same.
Give me a minute.

Evacuate.
Evacuate now.
Yes, Officer Cheung?
1 mom oi 0-4
can blow up the whole Tunnel.
How about 500kg?
Can the Tunnel sustain
the explosion of 500kg?
Can the Tunnel sustain the shock wave?
It should not affect the infrastructure.
Thank you.
Calling Ben
Roger, Officer Cheung
I don't have a clear view of the device
I only see
a red wire and a yellow wire.
Would you pick the red
or the yellow one?
Officer Cheung,
lam afraid I'll make the wrong choice.
All right.
Then I will choose
I will count to three
I will out the yellow one.
If it doesn't explode
follow my lead to cut the yellow one.
Is that clear?
Officer Cheung...
If there is an explosion
cut the red one.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir
