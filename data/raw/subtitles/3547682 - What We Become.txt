There now, sweetie.
It's just a bad dream, okay?
Everything's going
to be alright.
When you wake up tomorrow,
everything will be okay. Sleep now.
Dino?
Dino, is that you?
No! Go away!
We had a great time.
They were all there.
- Thank you. Here you go.
- I'm on the phone.
Upstairs, please.
Shut up.
Gustav, shoes.
Go on.
- And your hoodie.
- What about it?
- Hang it up.
- I need it again soon.
You still need to hang it up.
Well done.
I'm fed up with being the mean parent.
Why is it always me scolding them?
We're in this together.
Right? Dino?
- Hello, Dino?
- What?
I always tell them to clean their room
and do their homework.
- Sure, we're in this together.
- Thanks, Dino!
Stop that. I hate it.
If I told you the world was ending,
you'd still just whistle.
Like the time when the fridge fell
on my foot...
- Shall we go?
- Sure.
An infectious disease has struck the
Solg√•rden nursing home in Sorgenfri.
Eight residents are in a critical
condition and have been hospitalized.
Sweetie, let's go.
No, don't. Stop it.
- Dino, just get that hunting license!
- Oh, Casper.
You'd love it. Up early, a dram with
your coffee, and off into the sunrise.
I prefer plastic-wrapped meat from that
supermarket. They open early too.
It's not the meat, it's
the hunt.
The rush.
The thrill of...
You've moved on to dessert already?
- Pour me a beer?
- Sure.
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Who?
- He was just lying in front of the TV.
- Who?
- What's wrong?
- She says someone isn't breathing.
- Where do you live?
- 8 Kongestien.
Hold this. Let's take a look.
- 8 Kongestien?
- Call an ambulance, Gustav.
Only yesterday we went out for a stroll
and nothing was wrong with him then.
Dino is going to go inside and check.
- We'll wait here for the ambulance.
- Oh, that sounds good.
He wasn't there. She said he was
lying there, all blue in the face.
- Why was he blue?
- It's just an expression.
- Because he was dead.
- Really?
No. And no one's dead.
The old lady forgot
that her husband was in bed snoring.
No, the paramedics couldn't
find him anywhere.
Maybe she forgot he went for a stroll.
She seemed absent-minded.
No. She wasn't the least bit senile.
She said he felt cold to the touch.
- Why was he cold?
- Because dead bodies are cold.
No.
No one's dead,
and no one's cold.
The old man went to the drugstore
to get some syrup for his cough.
- Right, Dino? Dino?
- Huh?
- Isn't that right?
- Sure.
He went to get some cough syrup
and wrinkle cream for his ugly wife.
As well as something for warts
and bad breath.
Oh no, I'm turning
into the Tickle Monster!
Shit.
Hey.
- What's your name?
- Why?
We're practically neighbors,
so it would be nice to know.
- My name's Sonja.
- Gustav. I'm Gustav.
Okay, Gustav.
See you.
Where are you going?
- I'm going to check out this dump.
- You're in luck then.
- What?
- I'll give you the grand tour.
It won't take long, I promise.
So? What do you say?
Ninus...
Ninus?
Oh, there you are, Ninus!
Come here!
Are you hungry?
What do you usually do then?
We go to the lake,
and hang out and fish.
- Fish?
- Well, once.
Normally, we listen to music,
and smoke and drink.
Cool.
- Want one?
- Thanks, but I prefer non-filter.
- Here.
- Thanks!
Has your dad got a pair
of binoculars?
No.
Okay.
Relax. It's just an animal.
Come. Let's go check it out.
The police and the health authorities
have set up a temporary control zone
and ask the citizens of Sorgenfri
not to cross the following limits:
The Fredriksdalsvej-Klausdalsbrovej
intersection
the area north of the river and the
area between Sorgenfri and Virum.
The health authorities say
there is no cause for alarm.
In case of illness, do not go
to the hospital or to your doctor
but call this hotline: 1819.
I repeat...
- Maj?
- Gustav?
Maj?
Maj, come inside.
Come on.
- Go home and turn on your TV.
- Let go.
- Go home and turn on your TV.
- Let go of me!
This is an emergency alert.
The police urge everyone to make way
for an emergency convoy on the way
to Sorgenfri from the freeway.
In case of illness,
do not call 911
but call the health hotline.
Stay posted on...
Gustav, look!
- You must tell us where you go.
- How old do you think I am?
Who cares? There's an epidemic raging.
No time for a picnic.
- I didn't know.
- That's why you must say where you go.
Fuck you!
You never listen to me.
You might not believe in the
tooth fairy, but she believes in you.
So you better look under
your pillow tomorrow.
I know it's you, Dad.
- What do you mean?
- You put money under the pillow.
Get out of here!
I can't fly.
- We're not done.
- I am.
- You barely ate.
- Is that a crime?
No, of course not.
Gustav, wait.
Yes.
Hey. Can I come in?
New game?
- No.
- It looks extremely violent.
Yes, just like watching the news,
only this isn't real.
You play games too much.
You watch more TV than
I play games.
Then they all went to the woods.
All week they played and had fun.
"Let's do this again,"
Alexander's parents said.
And they lived happily
ever after.
That's all, folks.
- Mom.
- Yes, sweetie?
- I hope I die before you.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't want to see you blue and cold.
- No, sweetie.
Don't say that.
Maybe we won't die at all.
Scientists are making a pill
that'll give us eternal life.
- What if they don't make it in time?
- They will, sweetie.
Stop it, Puss.
Will you stop it, Puss?
Puss?
Puss...
Hello?
Claus?
Claus, is that you?
Are you okay?
She's asleep.
- Get back inside.
- What's going on?
- Go inside.
- But what is going on?
- Step back inside.
- Don't threaten me!
What's your name?
Get back inside now!
Move it!
An emergency plan
has been launched in Sorgenfri
after an infectious outbreak
has caused
an unspecified number of deaths
and illnesses in the area.
The National Serum Institute is trying
to identify an eventual virus
with the help of specialists
from the Swedish University...
- Why won't they say how many are dead?
- That's not so strange.
Back in the 80s,
a football stadium stand collapsed.
In the ensuing stampede,
people were crushed to death.
Staying still, they would have survived.
The police want to prevent a panic.
But if the stand collapsed, they had
to run so as not to get killed.
Gustav, let's focus on the positive.
Which is?
We'll spend more time together.
Moisten hands and wrists before
distributing the soap evenly.
Wash thoroughly
for at least 15 seconds.
Remember fingertips, thumbs,
the back of the hand and wrists.
Rinse off the soap
and pat hands until dry.
Hand hygiene is the best way
to prevent dissemination.
If anyone becomes ill,
call 1819 to reach the health hotline.
Stop!
Stop the car!
Turn around now!
Back up!
Fire!
Open your mouth.
Open.
Thanks.
Next
Open your mouth.
It'll be over soon, sweetie. Soon.
And then we're off on vacation.
Next.
Maj... come on.
It won't take long.
- Get her over to the window.
- Come on. I'll count to three.
Maj, just do it.
- Hurry up!
- Maj, now!
A temporary field hospital has been
established in Sorgenfri.
Christian Andersen,
professor of epidemiology,
is leading the medical effort
on site.
We are in contact
with the best doctors worldwide.
We have the capacity to receive
hundreds of patients if necessary.
How many have died so far?
- I can't comment on that.
- When will you have a cure?
At this point we don't have
a specific treatment.
For the sake of patients
and their next of kin
we will not show
images of the patients.
Anna, for the last time:
I'm not infected.
Let go of me. Let go!
Anna, calm down.
Close the door and go inside.
- Go back inside!
- Let me out.
- Close the door!
- Let me out!
- Go on!
- No!
Get away from there, Anna.
Look at that. Here you go.
- Where's Maj?
- Here.
- You're filming?
- Oh, right.
- Take it!
- That was mean of me.
That was mean of me.
Everybody's happy again.
Unbelievable.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Is that it?
There.
More than a month's research
into the virus has yielded no results.
Tests are now being examined
in the US.
Specialists from the Russian Center
for Disease Control, VECTOR
are establishing a mobile laboratory
near Sorgenfri.
The isolation zone has been extended
to include the nearby city of Virum
and maybe the city of Lyngby
will be added to the list.
Freeway 201 is still closed...
There.
We're out of gas.
... all tried to access the isolation
zone, but were stopped by the army.
Why is the internet down?
Can't we complain?
It's that sound again.
If it were only now and then, but
it's all the time now. It's unbearable.
It sounds like shots.
What do they expect?
That we're happy just sitting here?
The other day...
- What are you doing?
- They're at it again.
- They beat up someone at Sonja's.
- I told you to seal that hole.
- Listen to me!
- You're exaggerating.
- They're insane!
- I'm sure they have a good... Gustav!
- Gustav, stop!
- What about Sonja?
- Let go, for fuck's sake!
- What are you going to do?
We can't do a thing, Gustav.
We can't do a thing.
Think of your family.
Think of your mom,
your little sister.
We can't do a thing, Gustav.
- Move!
- Let's go! Move it!
Stop!
Anna.
They're leaving.
Anna.
Anna, did you hear me?
It's over.
Anna?
Anna! Anna!
Stay here!
Anna, what the hell
are you doing?
Gustav?
Gustav.
Where the hell were you?
- I saw the soldiers shoot the patients.
- What?
They're killing them at the school.
- Why would they kill them?
- I don't know, but I saw them.
They're killing them, Dad. Everything
they say on the news is a lie!
- Can we come in?
- It's Sonja and her mom.
- Gustav said we could come in.
- No, you're not coming in.
It's best for each family to stay
in their own home.
If we stay indoors,
we'll be safe, they said.
- This is all the food we have left.
- We'll just have to share what's left.
What if they're infected? What if
they come for us, because they're here?
Have you lost your mind?
Her fever-crazed husband
kicked her down the stairs.
Too bad, but if they aren't infected,
they should fuck off back home!
- Go tell them then.
- That's your job.
- What if Gustav and Maj were alone?
- But they aren't.
- It might as well be us!
- But it isn't, okay!
Hey.
- Here.
- Thanks.
What's that?
My dad...
He attacked her.
He'd gone crazy.
Well...
See you tomorrow.
Yeah, see you.
Sleep tight.
You too.
Dad?
We all fit in the car.
- Let's wait.
- Until we get infected and shot?
- Let's wait, Gustav.
- You're scared?
Yes, I'm...
Hello?
Who's...
Who's there?
What do you want?
Go away!
We haven't got anything.
Go away!
They're gone.
- Okay?
- What's up?
Grab the book case!
Open the door!
- It's Casper.
- Don't open!
Gustav!
Lock the door!
What's going on?
I was going to take off,
and then...
I saw someone.
I fired a shot into the air to drive
them away, but they attacked me and...
And then I shot them.
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
- Now what?
- The kitchen.
- Are we leaving now?
- We're not going anywhere.
Tell Dad to check the tickets
and pack our stuff.
Mom, we're staying at Gustav's place.
Go back to sleep.
The light...
Turn off the light.
Thanks.
When... I reached the freeway,
they'd blocked it.
It was pure chaos.
The worst thing was this little girl
in the crowd...
They all attacked her.
I couldn't do anything.
I had to run.
We have to get some sleep.
I'll take the first shift.
How is your mother, Sonja?
Uhm... she's better.
Oh, the sun is red, Mom
and the forest black.
Now the sun is dead, Mom
and the night is back.
The fox is right outside, Mom.
We mustn't let him in.
Please sit down by my side, Mom
and let me hear you sing.
Mom?
Take it easy.
It's burning... it's burning.
- It's burning.
- Mom, take it easy.
Ninus?
Ninus?
Have you seen Ninus?
- Have you?
- Rabbits always find a way out.
A friend of mine had to buy
his son a new rabbit every week,
because they run off.
When this is all over,
you and I will go get two new rabbits.
But I only want Ninus.
We have to get out of here.
Yes.
But we have to recon the area first.
Two of us should be enough.
I'm game.
How about you, Anna?
How about it?
I...
- I'll go.
- No, Gustav, I'll go.
I'll go.
This is a warning.
This is the military.
Leave the area immediately.
We will open fire
on the count of three.
Three...
... two... one.
Get down!
Maj is gone.
I can't find her.
Stay here, Sonja!
Gustav!
Maj?
Have you seen my boyfriend?
A man attacked us.
Have you seen him?
Lars? Lars!
- Lars!
- Shut up!
Casper!
Thanks.
Don't thank me.
Give me the box.
- You can't be serious.
- Give me the box.
I have two small children at home.
We haven't got a thing.
Give me the fucking box!
Ninus?
Ninus?
Ninus?
Elna? Have you seen Ninus?
Have you?
Maj?
- Help me, Mommy.
- Hurry!
Maj!
Maj?
Dino!
Run!
Come on!
Run!
Gustav!
Help!
Help!
Sonja?
- I'd like to be alone with her.
- Why?
I think she's going
to turn into one of them.
No, no...
Move away, Pernille.
Di... Dino.
Dino, no!
Sonja!
Sonja, hurry!
Gustav! Run!
There now, sweetie.
It's just a bad dream, okay?
Everything's going to be alright.
When you wake up tomorrow,
everything will be okay. Sleep now.
Dino?
Dino, is that you?
No!
- Move away from her.
- No!
Move away, Pernille!
No.
Move, Pernille.
