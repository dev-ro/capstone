The Tired Death
(Destiny)
The town in the past...
Every evening, the high notables
of the small town
met at the Golden Unicorn
for the twilight cup...
His Ponderousness
the Mayor...
His Reverence
the Pastor...
His Erudition
the Doctor...
His Measuredness
the Notary...
... and the new teacher...
In other days, the ancient candlesticks
heard every evening the most
important news of the town...
But since some time,
the esteemed notables
had but a single topic:
the stranger,
and ever again the stranger...
One day, a stranger
asked the gravedigger
for the way to the town.
To the latter,
he looked strangely known,
though he had never
seen him in person...
"Who owns the land
beside the cemetery?"
"The Municipality has destined it
to the enlargement of the graveyard..."
"I hardly believe that
the Municipality is willing to
give away the cemetery land...
But, why the devil are you
interested exactly in that one -?"
"I'm a much tired wanderer...
I wish to make me a garden here..."
"Next to the graveyard - ?!"
The stranger's request
gave rise to a fierce debate
among the counselors;
but the gold he offered
was highly appealing...
The stranger's proposal
was approved unanimously,
and he was granted
the graveyard land
for ninety nine years...
But the joy of the conceited town-dwellers
was not unclouded;
because the stranger had built,
between his mysterious being
and the others,
an evenly unclimbable wall
all around his estate...
"You can see by yourselves, Sirs!
I've run all around the wall,
and found neither door nor gate - !"
"Stop your efforts, men!
I alone know the door
that opens this wall!"
"And nobody has yet found
a door in that weird wall - ?"
Second Verse.
"It's a good old custom
of the Golden Unicorn,
that young couples drink
the first dip from the bridal cup ---
And it's easily guessed
that you are sweethearts!"
"Excuse me...
do you know where my bridegroom went?"
"My dear child, your groom
went away with the stranger,
the one that was
sitting at your table..."
There are plants, that from
the magic light of the full moon
draw mysterious virtues:
mandrake and Salomon's seal,
wolfberry and centaury...
Nobody knew better
than the old chemist...
"Child, child,
you're quivering by fever!
But wait,
I'll make you a tonic tea,
and you'll feel better at once!"
Hymn XIX.
Put me as a seal on your heart,
And as a seal on your arm.
Because Love is as strong as Death,
Passion as steady as Hell
Its heat is burning
And a flame of the Lord
Because Love is as strong as Death,
"Hear, people:
the bell has struck eleven ....."
"What do you want, child,
in my kingdom?
I didn't call you..."
"I want to know
where's my beloved!"
"I did not steal him...
his time was over!"
"What you see here,
are the lives of men...
They light up and burn
for some time long -
And they go out,
when God so decides..."
"Believe me, my task is heavy
It's a doom!
I'm tired of seeing
the sufferings of men
And reaping hate, when I obey to God..."
"And is there a way,
to awake an extinct light
to a new life, Death - ?"
"No way. You overcome me - ?"
"I believe that Love
is as strong as Death - !"
"Is your love as strong as death?
Will you fight
against the immortal one?
I'd bless you,
should you succeed in beating me!"
"Here are three lights,
that are about to go out...
I put them in your hands,
save them!
If you succeed, - even one only -
I'll give you back your beloved's life!"
Third Verse.
"Come, believers!
Come to the prayer!"
Ramadan.
"Allah'l Allah il Allah
we Mohammed rafful Allah !!"
Zobeide, the Calif's sister.
The pagan...
"There's no god other than God -
and Mohammed is his prophet"
"Are you crazy - ?!
Do you want both us lost - ?!"
"I haven't seen you
since the beginning of Ramadan!
Night after night,
I've waited for a sign
to plunge into your arms again...
in vain..."
"Tonight... I'll send you Aisha...
but now I beseech you:
leave the sanctuary,
or else you are lost - !"
"A pagan - ! An infidel - ! A giaour !!!"
"A giaour has violated the sanctuary !!"
"Back...
don't stain the sanctuary
with an infidel's blood !"
The Calif.
"Zobeide - ?
My sister -- ??!"
"We don't know
where the stranger's hiding,
but listen to my advice, Calif..."
"As if I cared
for a giaour's fate - !
I only wanted
to save the sanctuary
from corruption by his blood - !"
"You'll be glad, then, knowing
that there's no escape for the violator
of the sanctuary - !"
"We are following him closely...
and I have had the town
surrounded by the guards,
so whoever tries to escape
will go straight into my hands..."
"You must go to him, Aisha-
go and bring him to me
by the secret way - !"
"Only here he's safe - !
They won't seek him
in his persecutor's palace !"
El Mot, the gardener...
"Come, at dark, by the secret way!
The Mistress will hide you
in the palace, till the crowd's rage
has died out!"
"Surround the palace of Princess Zobeide...
Let anybody in...
nobody out...!"
Night...
"Come with me,
I'll hide you until the
hounds' watch has weared out..."
"The Calif -- !"
"What's happening - ?!"
"Perhaps, they're hunting a raging dog !"
"Your orders have been
carried out, Sir !"
"The night is beautiful, sister...
I'd like to stay up late
on the palace's terrace...
Will you keep me company - ?"
"Who's digging at this late hour
in our garden...?"
"El Mot, the gardener,
wants to give you a surprise..."
Fourth Verse.
"I'm glad to see
a smile on your mouth,
my beautiful betrothed!"
"How often men
are near their death
unknowingly...
They think they have
the eternity before -
yet it's no more
than a rose's life
with which they play..."
"Messer Giovanfrancesco
is much disliked
by the Council of the Fourteen...
Too much... Perhaps
he'll not see next dawn..."
"Not for nothing
I'm the best fighter
among the Fourteen...
And when Carnival
heats one's blood, it's not uncommon
to come down to fists...
the usual deadly end..."
"I know, you hate me,
Monna Fiametta...
and up to the day of our wedding,
you're free to doom me for nothing..."
"Afterwards, I hope
you'll have a smile for me too -
And a rose...
as for the other one.-
That by then will be rotten..."
Cockfight.
Letters.
"This letter
is for Messer Girolamo..."
"Tell him
I'm sending him this letter
with my most beautiful smile!"
"With this letter run fast
to Messer Giovanfrancesco... 
beware...
don't mention it to anyone...
less than ever Messer Girolamo...!"
"Call the Moor here!"
I, Monna Fiametta, beg you
to be my guest tonight.
I think we have much to say.
Come when the bell strucks ten.
The maid will guide you.
"Madonna Fiametta sends you this letter
with her most beautiful smile!"
"Have you by chance
a second letter to deliver?"
"I have an enemy, Moor, -
whom I've invited tonight -
and I won't let him
to leave this house alive -
Do you understand - ?"
My love, fly away!
The Council of the Fourteen
wants your death,
and Girolamo is going
to be your hangman!
Avoid riots!
Fly secretly,
and don't come back home
before I call you!
The destiny that Girolamo
prepared for you,
shall be fulfilled
on himself tonight!
I kiss your eyes
and your heart!
Fiametta
"I'll push him here,
where you are,
with the tip of my sword...
And when he turns his back on you..."
"Madonna Fiametta
sends this to you!"
"And this letter..."
I, Monna Fiametta, beg you
to be my guest tonight.
I think we have much to say.
Come when the bell strucks ten.
The maid will guide you.
"... and a good advice - !
Not a word, not a sound
if you care for your life
and for Monna Fiametta's honour...
Whatever happens, stay silent..."
Ten o'clock.
"Now -- !!"
Fifth Verse.
O Most Reverend One!
O Millenary One!
O Phare of Wisdom!
O Jewel!
Tomorrow is my birthday,
and I've decreed great rejoicings
in the whole Empire of the Middle!
And I wish that
on my birthday you,
o Pearl among all Wizards,
drive out my imperial boredom
with new tricks
from your excellent mind!
With best greetings,
Your
DJOU SCHÃœATI WANG
Emperor.
P.S. Should you,
against all expectations,
bore me,
o Most Reverend One,
with my highest regret
I'll be compelled
to have you beheaded!
The Above.
"Tiao Tsien...! Liang!!
Tiao Tsien...! Liang!!"
"Would you perhaps be so kind to bring me
my Sunday jade magic wand - ?!"
... before, the honorable Master A Hi
disposed of the cause of his troubles!
"We go!"
The Son of Heaven!
The Emperor's Archer.
"Son of Heaven, have mercy
of the lurid toad
who kisses the dust
under your feet!
Master A Hi is not seen on any road."
"O Son of Heaven, have mercy
of the miserable earthworm
at your feet!
No trace of Master A Hi
is yet seen on any river!"
"A Hi - !!!"
"On with magic!"
"Abracadabra...
Witch's fat...
Three black cats!!!"
"Lofty Son of Heaven!
So that you be always shielded
against your enemies,
let me present you,
on your birthday,
with a whole well organized army!"
"Pay homage
to the noble Son of Heaven!"
"How much will this cost again -!"
"My dear A Hi,
your gift is beautiful,
but its bringer is even more so!
I'll keep her too!"
"O Son of Heaven, let me give you,
in place of this unworthy little frog,
a magic horse,
matchless in the world!"
"My dear A Hi,
I'm quite satisfied with you
I'll keep the horse ---
and the girl as well!"
"O Highest One, that's impossible!
I cannot do my magic
without the girl!"
"So - ? You can not - ?
Wait and you'll see,
that you'll be able to!
Either you'll be..."
"... or - !"
"O Son of Heaven,
your eloquence is irresistible!"
"Lock him in the highest pagoda!
Tomorrow at dawn
he'll be beheaded - !"
"You must make her
more flexible with me, A Hi,
otherwise --
you already know !!"
"You will help me, won't you - ?!"
"Be reasonable, Tiao Tsien!
What can poor Liang offer you!
But the Emperor ---!"
"Give me back my magic wand!!"
"You -- you...
you miserable,
horrid cactus,
you -- !!"
The flight...
The pursuers...
"We must go faster, Liang!
The path narrows down!"
"The jade piece from
A Hi's magic wand
becomes ever smaller,
each time I use its power!"
"Go on! Go on -!"
"They are close!"
"Demons of fire,
block the way with flames!"
The night...
"Take A Hi's magic horse,
and bring me the two,
dead or alive!"
The magic steed.
Sixth Verse.
"Do you understand now, child,
why I'm tired
and fed up with my task?
I'm the eternal invincible one...
Go back to the living -
and live!"
"Give me back my beloved's life!"
"There's a last way - !
Bring into my magic circle
a human hour, of another
life not extinguished yet,
having before itself
years... days... hours. -
Then I'll give back
your beloved's life..."
"...... eleven !
Guard fire and lights,
that nobody be harmed..."
"Praise be to God - !"
"Death took my beloved --
I want to join him!"
"Old man, you have already lived so long!...
What more can life offer you...?"
"Give me your life,
give me the few days
that perhaps are left to you -
help me to save
my beloved's life - !"
"Not a day --
not an hour --
not a breath - !!"
"The beggar - !"
"Beggar, do you want
to end your troubles - ?"
"Give me your life - !"
"Not a day --
not an hour --
not a breath - !!"
The hospital.
"The mother is well
and the child is sound...
But the young man
admitted this evening,
died just before ten...!"
"Holy God, poor boy!
To die so young - !"
"And ourselves,
who would be glad
not to wake up next morning,
death doesn't want to do with!"
"If your life is so sad --
who among you gives it to me --
by goodness' sake - ?!"
"She was the last one - !"
"My child - !!"
"... another life,
not extinguished yet..."
"I can't pay you such price...
Now take my life too!
Because without my beloved one
it has no value for me - !!"
"I'll take you
to the one you love!"
"Who gives up his life, will gain it..."
"Hear what I say, people:
The bell has struck twelve!
Beware of ghosts and spooks.
That no evil spirit
may steal your soul!"
