Ooh!
- Are you all right, sir?
- Better ask my nurse!
My English is not good enough
for me to know!
That daughter of mine's
knocking 'em cold before her time!
- Knocking them cold? What does it mean?
- Just an expression.
Lucky if you didn't catch
your death of cold.
Hello, Louis. Good thing
you didn't lose your head.
- Sorry I upset you.
- Don't mind, it was a very aw...
..awkward moment.
Come along, now,
we've been here quite long enough.
I think I must go
back to the hotel now.
- No more jumping?
- No, that was my last chance.
Oh, your fault,
terrible woman!
It wasn't,
it was a silly little dog.
I might have been killed,
you know.
My last day here
might have been my last day on earth!
- Your last day?
- You're not leaving tonight?
I'm afraid, yes.
By the last train.
- Oh, Uncle Louis!
- Why do you call me Uncle?
- Well, you're just like an uncle.
- How dare you, miss!
- We shall miss you.
- Mummy will cry her eyes out.
- Won't she, Daddy?
- Yes, dear.
- You think so?
- Oh, she adores you, doesn't she?
- Yes, dear.
- I am desolate to go.
Would you and your charming wife
have dinner with me tonight?
- She'd love it, both of us.
- Good.
Uncle Louis... I get awfully hungry
in the evenings.
You get awfully sleepy, too, darling.
Long after your bedtime, my child!
Let me sit up.
I'll sleep in tomorrow.
- Ask your mother.
- Let's!
Where is Jill?
In the finals of the
clay pigeon shooting.
- I do hope she wins.
- Who is against her?
- That fellow Ramon.
- Uh-huh.
- Then she's got to win!
- Don't you like him, trouble?
- Do you?
- He's all right.
Bit of a bore, but he means well,
doesn't he?
- Why don't you like him?
- He's got too many teeth...
..and too much brilliantine!
Sworn enemies,
eh?
You English have
such a sense of humour.
- I can't say I hope you'll win.
- I'm sure that you will.
So beautiful,
so clever.
Yes, well, let's get on with it,
shall we?
Are you ready?
- Mummy, may I stay up tonight?
- Darling, ask me presently.
Say yes now,
just for luck.
You little wretch! Look...
here's that brooch you wanted.
Now will you run
away and be quiet?
- Ohh, it's...
- Shhh!
- Daddy, don't you like it...
- Shut up, darling!
Sorry.
- Look.
I'm not a baby!
Let that be a lesson to you.
Never have any children.
- That was your fault, fat-head!
- It wasn't!
Betty...! You know your child's going
to cost me the match, don't you?
- She's your child, too!
- If I lose, I'll disown it for ever!
Shhh!
I am sorry you lost, Madame Lawrence,
but delighted I won.
You're a marvellous shot,
and I know what I'm talking about.
- You make me blush!
- We'll have another battle one day.
- I shall live for that moment.
- Well, you would have this child!
Oh, Madame Lawrence,
you English are extraordinaire!
Ahh, my love!
- Ahh, my darling!
- My lunch!
- You can keep your brat.
- Thank you.
I'm just going off
with another man!
Darling, you go to bed early.
.. with Betty.
Poor Daddy.
Sir, you have beaten my wife and
she has gone off with another man.
You are a dirty dog!
You are as comical
as your charming wife!
Is that Mummy's knitting?
- Yes. Why?
- Donnez-moi. Bung it over.
- Go on, Louis, perform.
- What do you mean?
Do your stuff.
Er, what do you think
of the average Englishman?
Much too cold.
Except when he drinks too much,
of course.
Is that jumper for him?
Of course it is.
Did you think it was for you?
It's a memento.
To wear over my beating heart!
- Has it been fire-proofed?
- Daddy, don't!
Oh... Look!
I'm sorry...
Quick...
..tell Bob...
..my... brush.
.. in my room.
Take it to...
the British Consul...
..or to..
. Gibson.
No, Louis!
Don't breathe...
Don't breathe a word... to anyone.
Betty, will you be a good girl
and run up to bed?
- Go on, darling, buzz off.
- All right.
- It's a bullet!
- Smashed the window!
- Any letters?
- Yes, sir, two.
Bob, he's dead,
it's horrible!
- Good God!
- Bob, listen.
Something's behind all this.
He said you were to go to his room.
Something about a brush.
He gave me the key.
- Bob, what can this all mean?
- We'll soon find out.
- Good evening. Anything the matter?
- Nothing at all.
If I were you and if I.
.. Hand it over!
Pardon, sir,
no doubt there is an explanation.
- Of what?
- Why you were in that room.
Monsieur Bernard's room.
It is irregular, most irregular!
Oh, yes, that's easy to explain.
Anything I can do to help.
Can you get the British Consul
for me on the phone?
- But first...
- Yes, first.
- I've something vital to tell him.
- British Consul?
Yes, please.
Perhaps it will be better
if you come to my private room.
- Of course I will, certainly.
- Thank you very much.
- It is the purest formality.
- Of course.
- Pardon me, but in my position...
- It's quite all right.
This way,
sir, please.
You won't forget
I want to phone the Consul?
Presently, mein Herr.
Certainly, at once.
Mario,
post the letter.
I must go and talk to my wife.
The Commissary wishes to see
each one separately. It is formal.
- He was your friend.
- But we knew little of him.
Excuse me... er... can you tell me if
the British Consul's in town today?
- Ich verstehe nicht.
- Oh.
D-D-Do...
Um... Er...
Can you...
The British...
Der britische Consul...
You know, the man who... Er, is he here?
- Hier?
- Ja, ist ein Herr.
No, I don't mean is he a man?
I mean, is he here?
Here? Nein.
Listen,
i-is he here in St Moritz?
Look,
der britische Consul...
Est-ce qu'il...
Est-il ici aujourd'hui?
Oh, damn, I...
I can't remember
how far he was from the window.
You must let me go in there
and talk to my wife!
You cannot, sir. The Commissary is in
charge. What can I do? Please ex cuse.
But...
- Sie duerfen hier nicht rein.
- If you don't mind, I must...
- Was?
- Captain Lawrence!
- Please.
- Oh, thanks very much.
It was left at the
desk of the hall porter.
It was marked very urgent.
Thank you.
That's fine.
- He said you have to go.
- I'm sorry. I've got a message for my wife.
The... Mitchisons can't come
to lunch tomorrow.
We'll have to put
the others off, too.
"Say nothing of what you found or
you will never see your child again."
What is that note?
Give it to me!
I've nothing to add
to what I've said, Inspector.
- Nothing whatever.
- No use talking like that.
It just won't do.
On March 10th, you and Mrs Lawrence
went to Switzerland.
Thank you. 
Yes.
To St Moritz.
Yes.
With your little daughter.
- Yes. Whisky and soda?
- Oh, thank you.
On March 19th,
you returned to London.
- Uh-uh-uh!
- Sorry.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
You returned to London...
without your little daughter.
Yes.
- One for you?
- Thank you.
- Where is she?
- Staying with her aunt.
- What's this aunt's name?
- Mary.
And where is she staying
with this aunt?
In Paris.
- Street and number?
- Complicated place name.
Difficult for an English person
to remember. One for you?
By the way, why were you so upset
the night you left Switzerland?
I'm not aware that I was upset.
Was it because your child
had been... kidnapped?
And another thing..
. my point is this.
He's not the sort of chap
to give things away,...
..lose his head, spill the beans,
all that sort of business.
See what I mean?
- When I was in the Navy...
- Is that train electric?
Yes. 20 volts.
Best present I
ever gave the kid.
- Doesn't play with it now, does she?
- She never did.
You never gave her a chance.
I say, you mustn't get jumpy,
you know.
Really you mustn't.
What I mean to say is,
once you begin that sort of thing,...
..lose grip and.
.. er... and...
I know.
I'm all right.
Oh, Clive, you've got Pullmans
and coal trucks on the same train!
Good Lord,
so I have!
- Is that your last word, sir?
- Absolutely.
I'm sorry to say it, sir,
but I don't believe you.
It's your duty as a citizen.
- Thanks for calling.
- You will be sorry.
Don't drop in again.
Hello. Still here?
Lost your whistle or something?
I'm not a policeman.
My name's Gibson.
I'm Secretary to Sir Norman Wood
of the Foreign Office.
Really?
Never heard of him.
However,
how do you do?
Your friend Louis was
one of our people.
Special Service.
- You didn't know that, did you?
- I'm afraid not, no.
You didn't happen to find anything
in this brush, did you?
Nothing much.
I'm busy...
Enough to justify someone kidnapping
your child to keep your mouth shut.
- I never said so.
- Nonsense.
When Louis Bernard was killed,
there was a paper in here.
How thrilling.
Darling,
you haven't told them anything?
Not yet, but I think
he was just about to.
Jill dear, this is Mr Gibson
of the Foreign Office.
How do you do?
Oh, of course, I quite understand.
I think, if you listen to me, you'll
appreciate why I have to bother you.
Have you heard of
a foreign statesman called Ropa?
- I don't think so.
- R-O-P-A.
Then it won't worry you much
if he's likely to be assassinated.
- What's that got to do with us?
- Patience. I think you'll see.
Louis was killed because he knew
of a plot to assassinate Ropa.
A few hours later,
your child was kidnapped. Why?
Because, by that time,
you possessed that vital information.
It was on the paper
you found in the shaving brush.
Ropa is in London and an attempt
may be made on his life.
My department must protect him.
- Tell me what was on that paper.
- I can't.
I can tell you
what was on another piece of paper.
Our child had been kidnapped,
and if we spoke we'd never see her again.
It's her life against Ropa's.
Why should we care if some
foreign statesman's assassinated?
In June 1914, had you ever heard
of a place called Sarajevo?
Of course not. I doubt you'd heard
of the Archduke Ferdinand.
But, because a man you'd never heard of
killed another man you'd never heard of,...
..this country went to war.
- But...
- Don't tell him, Bob.
I'm sorry,
we're not interested.
What you've said may be true,
but our child's in danger.
That comes first, it must come first.
You see that, don't you?
Do you realise who we're dealing with?
You think they'd draw the line at murder?
How do you know she's alive,
that they haven't...?
- All right, hold on a minute.
Someone on the phone in the hall.
It's about... about Betty.
- Switch it through here, will you?
- All right, I will.
Hello?
Good afternoon, Mr Lawrence.
Please listen very carefully.
We don't want to interrupt your chat
with the man from the Foreign Office,...
..but if you tell him anything
of what you know,...
..you will never see
your child again.
This is a final warning.
- But...
- What is it?
Somebody playing the fool.
Hello?
If you think somebody's
fooling you,...
..perhaps you'd like to speak
to the child yourself.
Hello, Daddy.
Betty!
Hello,
my darling.
Hello, Mummy,
is that you?
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mummy.
- Plenty to eat?
- Ask her where she is.
Yes, Mummy.
How are you getting on
without me, Mummy?
I'm missing you terribly,
darling.
Uncle Clive and I have been...
playing with your trains.
- Ask her where she is.
- Mummy, I want to come home!
- Oh, I do want to come home!
- So you shall, darling. Very soon.
- Ask her where she is!
- I'll come and fetch you.
Darling,...
..where are you?
Mummy,
they won't let me...
Darling?
Betty?
Steady, old girl,
steady.
Did either of you recognise
the first voice?
For God's sake! I'm sorry,
but can't you leave us alone?
- Can't we trace that call?
- The phone people would never tell.
Hello? Give me Special,
please, quickly.
Hello, this is G speaking.
Were you listening?
Where did the last call
to this number come from?
Wapping.
Public call box.
Notify Scotland Yard to have a
plain-clothes man posted on every corner.
Well, get them from
other districts!
Wapping.
Does that convey anything to you?
Nothing whatever.
If there is any trouble, I hope
you'll remember you're to blame.
Not a very nice thing
to have on your conscience.
All right, Bob,
I'll see him out.
Ask Lawrence to talk it over again
when I'm gone.
- You know where to ring me.
- Yes, thanks. Goodbye.
- Clive, here a minute.
- Yes?
- Are you coming?
- Where to?
- Wapping.
- Of course.
- I'll get our hats and coats.
- Why?
Those men Gibson ordered?
If these blokes see them,
they'll think we've given them away.
- Our only chance is to act.
- I'm coming!
No, stay here.
Keep on the end of that phone.
- If there's any news, we'll ring.
- Darling, I can't risk losing...
..both of you.
Blow your nose.
You won't lose either of us.
- What about your food?
- Leave me a bowl on the mat.
Here,
do you want this?
There can't be many
George Barbors in Wapping.
Couldn't think of another one
in that pub. Let's go.
Look... Are they plain-clothes men
over there?
All right,
come along.
- Here we go.
- Just a minute.
Think these things
are all right?
I think so.
You look terrible.
I say, Clive, any questions asked,
we're just off a boat.
- Good idea. In the Navy...
- How are your teeth? Hm?
Seems a pity.
- Come on, let's make a dash for it.
- Righto.
- Bit grim, isn't it?
- Yes.
Good evening.
My pal here's got a
rather bad toothache.
I'll look at it.
Come along.
Here.
Oh,
poor old boy.
- Five shillings, sir.
- Five shillings.
Give him five shillings
for me, will you, please?
- Just a minute.
- Better have a look at mine.
- What's wrong?
- I've had terrible toothache.
- Have a look at them, will you?
- Yes.
You stay outside
and keep your mouth shut.
Please.
Has he arrived?
Not yet.
- Just off a ship?
- Yes.
- Which one?
- The Sax on.
Hmm.
She's not due until tomorrow.
Er, no, I... got off at... er...
I got off at Tilbury.
Came on by train.
Tough skipper,
old Turner.
Not half!
Left her,
last voyage.
Yes, of course, that's right, I...
What I meant was...
I was wrong.
The voyage before last.
Yes, of course.
Slipped my memory.
Nothing much wrong
with your teeth.
I think you're right.
Not hurting as much as it was.
I'll be off.
- Wait.
- Why? What's the trouble?
- There's one there better come out.
- I think I'll chance it.
Sit down.
Here, doesn't a
doctor have to do that?
Has he come?
Oh, there you are.
Had a good crossing?
No,
sick all the way.
It is the last time I let myself
be smuggled into this country,...
..for you or anybody else.
You will be smuggled...
..when, how and where I am pleased
for you to be smuggled... yes?
It's your fault for having such
a wonderful aim with your gun.
You must pay the
price of your genius.
Everything ready for tonight?
I have arranged a box for you...
..most conveniently placed.
Any trouble with
the charming Miss Lawrence?
As quiet as a little mouse.
And where is the
little mouse now?
Oh, in a little hole in the ground
somewhere. You shall see.
Your last job tonight?
No, first.
Clive,
which way did they go?
- Where's Betty? Found out anything?
- Yes.
- Shall I give Jill a ring?
- No, come along, hurry!
- You sure they went in there?
- Must have. Almost certain.
I say,
Clive, look!
- What are they, Bob?
- Sun worshippers.
Probably they've got nothing on!
Come on,
let's go.
Praise be the source of light
The sun whose bonny rays
Set forth all power and light
And life doth fall away
Clive,
Clive, Clive
That woman at the end
Half left to you and me
What is the row,
old man?
I don't see
What you mean
La la la
Stand by
There's trouble coming soon
Perhaps those among us tonight
for the first time,...
..and not yet initiated
into the mysteries...
..of the First Circle
of the Seventh Old Ray,...
..may be wondering
what is going to happen now.
I will tell them.
Before proceeding to the mysteries
only for the initiate...
..it is necessary for the minds
and souls of us all...
..to become purged
and to be made clean.
I am therefore going to ask anyone here
who is not in tune with us...
..to submit to
a very simple process of control.
Merely place him or herself under
the guidance of the Fourth Circle.
Is there anyone here tonight
who would care...
Perhaps you.
Relax.
Keep your eyes
fixed on this light.
Keep them fixed.
Before receiving the first degree
of the Seventh Old Ray,...
..your mind must
be white and blank.
You are already feeling sleepy.
Do you hear me?
Yes.
Your mind is
becoming quite blank.
You feel that,
don't you?
Quite...
quite blank.
Yes.
Quite... blank.
I think that will
do for the moment.
Will all those who are not of the Fourth
Circle please leave as quietly as possible?
You're not going to leave
your friend, sir,...
..are you?
Hello!
Good evening.
I hope you weren't
very rough with him.
You see,
he's subject to apoplexy.
- Who?
- Who?
Poor old George Barbor
down at Wapping.
Is it all right in here?
Thank you.
I ought to have mentioned it
to you, perhaps.
You should learn to control
your fatherly feelings...
..and not drop things
on the floor, please.
Collected our brother's
little offering yet, have you?
Oh, sir,
I forgot.
Pardon me.
Dangerous.
Perhaps you would care to join our
little circle now, Mr Lawrence? Yes?
Oh, thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Why, if it isn't our friend
the sharpshooter!
Nice to see you again,
Mr Lawrence.
Thank you.
Nice to see you.
Now, is my young daughter
ready to go home yet?
Oh, no,
she's asleep...
No shooting!
You don't want the police here, do you?
Start playing that organ
or they'll hear this noise outside.
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Clive!
Through the window! Phone Jill!
Tell her to go to the Albert Hall!
Call the police!
Sorry.
Please forgive me.
Get on to Mrs Lawrence.
Tell her if she goes to
the Albert Hall tonight, her child is...
Come on.
Let me get at her!
Mr Lawrence,
please!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Clive!
L-Listen, Jill, you know that chap
we were looking for? Yes, A Hall.
It isn't a chap at all.
No, it's the real hall. Albert Hall.
- The Albert Hall!
- We're onto Betty all right.
Bob says you're to
go to the Albert Hall.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
Do what you can.
That's where it's happening. Stop it.
- B-But where...
- No, no! No time now!
Must get off for the police.
Oh,
is that Mrs Lawrence?
I'm afraid she's just
this minute gone out.
Will that be all for tonight,
sir?
No,...
..I shall want you to stay,
yes?
I'd rather go now, sir.
My husband wants his supper.
Besides, I don't want to be mixed up
in any nasty business.
- Rawlings.
- Hello?
See that Mrs Sprocket stays, huh?
See to it.
Are these poisoned?
Have a drink?
Thanks very much,
I'll have a gin and French.
Is this where you
write your sermons?
Sometimes.
Come, come,
don't blush, please.
Have you never
been to the seaside?
- You called her?
- No.
She'd gone.
Well, I've no doubt we can arrange
to deal with it in some other way.
That's my pal with the cops.
If he worries you,
gentlemen,...
..shoot and...
give him a bad leg.
No-one will hear.
So long.
Ah,
here he is again.
Officer, this gentleman
has been a great trouble tonight.
Nothing of the kind, officer.
My pal has a little girl.
He came down here
to look for her.
These chaps...
This fellow here, they're crooks.
He's a little intoxicated.
His friend was bad enough,
but he's worse, isn't he?
Constantly creating scenes
in this church.
Look here,
the pair of you...
Disorderly behaviour in a sacred edifice.
Is that the charge?
Alas, yes.
We don't wish to press it, officer,
but we've been very patient.
- Haven't we, Sister?
- Dammit, I...
- What have you got to say?
- Look, tonight, my friend and I...
- Where are they?
- Who?
Well, the whistle
that was blowing just now.
Oh, yes,
the arm of the English law...
..needed help taking our friend
to the station.
Very, very reluctantly,
I have given him a charge.
For disorderly behaviour
in a sacred edifice.
Atishoo!
Oh, dear!
Hmm, I forgot.
The little one,
shall she join us?
Do you mean Betty?
One of the sweetest children
I ever met. Bring her, please.
To a man with a heart
as soft as mine,...
..there is nothing sweeter
than a touching scene.
Such as?
Such as a father saying goodbye
to his child.
Ja,
goodbye for the last time.
What could be more
touching than that?
If you expect a scene from me,
you'll be disappointed.
We shall see.
Why do you look at me like that?
Betty!
Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Oh!
You all right,
darling?
I say, darling...
awfully smart dressing gown.
- Where did you get it, hmm?
Betty...
Betty, I want to tell you something.
Here! Oi!
Listen,
your school report's come.
Awfully good.
Really.
Let's go.
Where's Mummy?
Come on,
tell her.
At the Albert Hall,
my dear.
Oh, that reminds me... Your scene was
so charming, I was almost forgetting.
What is it?
A record of the piece they're playing
at the Albert Hall tonight.
- Charming, yes?
- What of it?
Oh, yes, I forgot. Music is less
in your line than marksmanship.
If you listen,
my dear Ramon,...
..I'll show you the exact moment
at which you can shoot.
Now listen carefully.
There.
At such a moment,
your shot will not be heard.
I think the composer
would have appreciated that.
No-one will know.
Except for one.
Hmm, if you are clever,
my friend.
Come, you must start soon.
It's impolite to be late for a concert.
And tell Mrs Lawrence...
..her little Betty and her husband
are very well.
Anything else?
Tell her they may
soon be leaving us.
Leaving us for a long,
long journey.
How is it that Shakespeare says?
"From which no
traveller returns."
A great poet.
Daddy, Daddy!
Let me go! Daddy!
Daddy! Let me go!
Daddy!
Oh,
little child
Little child
Oh,
little child...
- Is that it?
Sounds as if it
went off all right.
I hope so,
for all our sakes.
Quick!
There he goes!
Follow that car!
You, come with me.
Well?
It's all right.
What was that scream?
We apologise
to listeners...
..for the delay in the broadcast
of the concert from the Albert Hall.
An attempt was made to assassinate
the European diplomat,...
..Monsieur Ropa...
Attempt?
We are happy to say...
..that the shot merely caused a flesh
wound in Monsieur Ropa's shoulder...
..and he has been
able to return home.
We are now taking listeners
back to the Albert Hall...
..for the rest of the concert.
It must've been
that damn woman screaming!
Were you followed here?
No-one saw me leave.
I couldn't have been followed!
I hope you are right.
.. for your own sake.
For dear little Betty's.
Call the others.
Abbott wants you.
Come on.
Take a look.
Gangway,
please.
Looks like an
all-night job to me.
Baker!
Listen, I want you to go across
to their front door and knock.
Once that door's open,
see it stays open till we get across.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Quick,
come on, boys!
Know anything about that house?
Any idea if the child's inside?
I know no more than you do.
God, I hope not!
- They went to Wapping because...
- What's up?
- We've orders to clear the streets.
I've orders to clear my box.
- Anything further, Binstead?
- No, sir.
We can't do anything against them
with revolvers.
- I'm trying to raise some rifles.
- Where from?
There's a gunsmith's a few streets
away, sir. I've sent the lorry.
It's the rifles,
sir.
Good. Put the men in the house opposite
at the same level.
- Get in by the back door.
- Very good, sir.
Take charge of the firing party.
Clear people out of the houses
you occupy.
Very good, sir.
Where's your back yard?
Through the kitchen.
This way.
Sergeant, leave a couple of men
next door on the ground floor.
I'll take the rest in here.
Whose rifle's this?
It's mine.
- What's the trouble?
- You'll have to shift your family.
- I ain't married.
- All the better. You wait out here.
We've got business inside.
Much better if you
waited outside.
I came in
to see if everything was all right.
- Stop that.
This is a scrap,
not a smoking concert.
That piano will make a nice rest.
Let's move it over.
Come away from that window,
you'll get killed!
You've got to get out of this room.
The police want to come in.
Take your tunics off. Don't touch
that blind till you're in position.
- On hearing my whistle, open fire.
- Yes, sir.
Better take that mattress across,
give you a bit of cover.
I've come straight
off point duty.
I could do with a bit of a sleep
on that myself!
Still warm,
too.
Gertcha!
I'll tell your missis about yer!
- Are you ready?
- Wait a minute.
There must be some way
through to the house.
- Try all these doors.
- Come on, boys.
- They're locked, sir!
- Smash them in!
Break 'em right down,
go on!
They're all in!
It'd be safer if you were
farther up the street, madam.
My God,
that's done us!
- More ammunition wanted.
- All right, get it.
No, I finish!
I don't go on!
You took this on for our cause
and you've got to go through with it.
We ought to have taken a chance.
We ought to have shot our way out.
I never ordered the first policeman
to be shot.
Now we will have to try
and use... the child.
Go and fetch her.
Go and fetch her!
Yes?
I keep her close,
...
..then, if they get me,
they get her too.
- They're scarcely replying to our fire.
- My God, look at that!
It's Betty!
- Stop them firing!
Quick,
get that man!
I daren't, sir,
I might hit the kiddy.
Two men on the
roof after the girl!
Sergeant,
look after him.
The rest of you,
come with me.
Hello, darling.
Come on,
you're all right.
No!
Here's Mummy,
look.
It's all right.
It's all right.
