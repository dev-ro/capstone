LAMB
﻿Radio Reykjavík.
﻿Merry Christmas.
﻿Now, the evening prayer.
﻿CHAPTER I
﻿I have the feet.
﻿- You got it.
- Yes.
﻿There, there.
﻿They're saying
time travel is possible now.
﻿Oh?
﻿How are they going to do that?
﻿No, just, theoretically...
﻿They're saying
it's theoretically possible.
﻿Then someone must be trying
to figure out the practical details.
﻿Probably...
﻿Not that I'm in any hurry
to see the future.
﻿I like it fine in the here and now.
﻿I expect it'll be just as possible...
﻿to go back in time.
﻿Yes... of course.
﻿Shhh... ok.
﻿I didn't check the upper barn..
﻿I think you should start there.
﻿374.
﻿All good... shhh...
﻿This is better than last year.
﻿Which makes it better
than the year before.
﻿The tractor is making a new noise.
﻿Ah, ok...
We better take a look
before we start planting.
﻿Hey, boy. One more time.
﻿What's gotten into you, boy?
﻿Move!
﻿Move away, go!
﻿What did he say?
﻿Don't know. Missed it.
﻿Something about folk tales, I think.
﻿It's ok.
﻿- Ingvar...
- Yes.
﻿I'm off.
﻿I'll be out when she's asleep.
﻿No, just stay with her.
﻿Ok... I'll look after her.
﻿- Hi.
- Hi.
﻿- Is she still asleep?
- Yeah, she must have been tired.
﻿Did you put her to sleep
in the bedroom?
﻿No, she's on the couch.
﻿- I'll check downstairs.
- Yes.
﻿Ada.
﻿Ada.
﻿- Did you find her?
- No, she's not here.
﻿Listen..
﻿Everything will be ok...
we will find her.
﻿I'll go check down by the river.
﻿Ada!
﻿Ada!
﻿Ada!
﻿Ada!
﻿Ada!
﻿Anything?
﻿Go away!
﻿CHAPTER II
﻿Ok.
﻿This is pretty... let's try it on?
﻿Wow...
﻿you look beautiful.
﻿Come on, dog.
﻿Stay there.
﻿- Hello...
- Hi.
﻿Did you just arrive?
﻿No, I came in the night.
﻿I crashed in the barn.
﻿- You must be hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.
﻿Come on...
let's get you something to eat.
﻿Come, boy.
﻿- We have a guest.
- Oh?
﻿So you're back... Again?
﻿Good to see you.
﻿- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
﻿Are you expecting guests?
﻿Ada!
﻿Ada, honey.
﻿Come sweetie.
Don't be shy.
﻿Here you go.
﻿This is Pétur... daddy's brother.
﻿She's not used to strangers.
﻿Go right ahead... you're our guest.
﻿One more time.
﻿Can I splash?
﻿All ok?
﻿One more time.
﻿What the fuck is this?
﻿Happiness...
﻿Towel for you...
﻿then there are some clothes
in the closet that you can use.
﻿Come here...
﻿Good night, Uncle Pétur...
﻿Good night.
﻿- Ingvar...
- No. Pétur, no...
﻿There's nothing for us to talk about.
﻿Listen...
﻿you can stay here as long as you want
﻿but don't interfere with
how María and I live our lives.
﻿Ok?
﻿Why is he back?
﻿I don't know...
same as usual, I guess.
﻿People who misunderstand him...
and owe him money?
﻿Yeah, he's always been unlucky
in that way.
﻿- How long is he staying?
- Ssshhh...
﻿I don't know.
﻿Ada!
﻿- Want some coffee?
- Yes.
﻿Don't do that.
I ﻿saw you taking a bath last night.
﻿You left the door open. Were you maybe
hoping I'd come sneak a peek?
﻿What are you doing Pétur?
﻿Don't be such a goddamn child.
﻿It's you guys
who are acting childish...
﻿playing house with that animal.
﻿We're clearing some stuff in the shed.
﻿It'd be great if you could help out.
﻿Man, I've got fond memories of that one.
﻿You should, yes...
﻿- Hey...
- Should we get this done?
﻿Yeah, definitely.
﻿Here...
﻿Oh man, are you joking?
This thing is still here?
﻿Do you want some?
﻿Here, sheepie, sheep.
Here, little sheepie-sheep...
﻿That's right... you want to eat?
﻿Like a little lamb...
Yes, little lamb...
﻿What to eat, little sheep...
Sheepie, sheepie, sheep...
﻿What the hell do you think
you're doing man?
﻿Can't you ever leave
a good thing alone?
﻿Ingvar...
﻿Ingvar!
﻿It's not a child, it's an animal.
﻿Pétur...
﻿Ada..
﻿CHAPTER III
﻿Ada, come on sweetie.
﻿And now they are king and queen
in their kingdom.
﻿They sit in magnificent chairs,
that are called thrones.
﻿And they are very happy.
﻿And it was all because Dimmalimm
was such a good little girl.
﻿No one is so sweet and mild
as Dimma-limma-limm.
﻿And nowhere is so fair a child
as Dimma-limma-limm.
﻿Ada!
﻿Hold on tight.
﻿The fishes sing a sweet song
when found upon a hill.
﻿The sheep walk quietly along
on the ocean calm and still.
﻿Don't you know any rhymes?
﻿Just like your dad.
﻿When I was a boy...
I knew all the rhymes.
﻿Not that it has helped me much in life.
﻿Dammit!
﻿Seven down for your six.
﻿Yes...
﻿- Put this down...
- No, no hold on...
﻿- What?
- You're cheating.
﻿- No, I'm not cheating.
- You have to draw a card first.
﻿- Oh, yes.
- You always forget it.
﻿Hey...
﻿Hello! You guys sure took your time?
﻿You hungry, sweetie?
﻿- Good fishing I assume?
- Yeah, plenty of fish.
﻿Ada sweetie, come sit on the couch.
﻿What a piece of crap that tractor is...
I left it.
﻿Oh?
﻿You sure you weren't just out of oil?
﻿It may have absorbed some air
or something.
﻿- Did you empty out the filter?
- Do you think I'm stupid?
﻿There's a plate for you
if you're hungry.
﻿And what... You're boozing it up?
﻿Oh, just working on our team spirit
for the game... Have a glass.
﻿- No. I don't think so.
- You sure?
﻿Well... Maybe just a tiny sip.
﻿God dammit... well done.
﻿My nerves, man.
﻿What now...
Are they putting him on?
﻿Oh my god.
﻿Yes, yes, yes...
﻿Ok, ok. Come on...
come on, into the corner.
﻿Noooo!
﻿Why can't he just nail it?!
﻿Bunch of losers!
﻿- Come on 11 seconds left.
- Attack time, guys.
﻿- They're delaying...
- They're holding the ball...
﻿- What is he doing?
- Is he out?
﻿What is going on?
﻿What is happening?
﻿- Defend it...
- He'll defend it.
﻿He's got it no worries...
he's got it...
﻿Defend now, defend.
﻿Yes, yes...
﻿- No...
- No!!!
﻿No...
﻿We shouldn't have
watched this game.
﻿Listen.
﻿This doesn't work..
﻿Now, this should cheer us up.
﻿What are you doing? Turn it off.
﻿- What... You have this on VHS?
- Yes.
﻿How old is this even? It can't be...
﻿- Look at you.
- Stop this... come on turn it off.
﻿- Look how cute you are.
- Look, it's Uncle Pétur, look.
﻿- Look, it's Uncle Pétur.
- See how cool you were.
﻿I've never seen this...
﻿- You've never seen this?
- Never...
﻿- Of course you have seen it.
- No.
﻿You're kidding me...
﻿Dance?
﻿Yes. Come, let's try.
﻿- Oh, look at you.
- It doesn't age too badly.
﻿Looking classy and so young.
﻿...and jump.
﻿You were always so cool.
﻿Want to dance with Uncle Pétur?
﻿Uncle Pétur is on TV.
﻿What's happening to the handball specialist
that I was watching the game with?
﻿He doesn't know how to play it!
﻿Ok... come on, try me...
﻿- What is going on? You're off man.
- Hold on. Hold on...
﻿He has to have
a sip of whiskey in between.
﻿Man, that's good.
﻿Ok... bring it on.
﻿- One more time.
- One more time.
﻿Ok, one more time.
﻿Here.
﻿This time nothing...
Nothing goes past.
﻿- You ready?
- Yes, yes, bring it on.
﻿What is happening?
﻿- You okay?
- Yes, yes, I'm good.
﻿Come.
﻿That's all for me...
I think I have to go to bed.
﻿I'm not used to drinking so much.
﻿Say what?
﻿- I'm going to rest a bit.
- I think that's wise.
﻿Close my eyes a bit...
﻿Well, old man... There.
﻿Ada, honey...
﻿Come here.
﻿Lie down with me
while I fall asleep.
﻿Well, well.
﻿- Is he asleep?
- He just... Bam.
﻿He got so drunk.
﻿No. Come on,
it's been such a nice evening.
﻿It could get even nicer.
﻿Listen, stop this.
﻿Does... Ada know...
that you killed her mother?
﻿Come.
﻿Ah, María.
﻿María...
﻿This is not funny.
﻿María... Come on.
﻿Open up.
﻿María.
﻿Open the door!
﻿María!
﻿María!
﻿María!
﻿María!
﻿María!
﻿María!
﻿Pétur...
﻿We're leaving.
﻿I'll wait in the car.
﻿María?
﻿Pétur?
﻿Thank you, Ada dear.
﻿Ada, can you turn off
the radio for me, honey?
﻿Pétur.
﻿I know...
﻿Ada is a gift...
﻿A new beginning.
﻿Dog!
﻿Ada, honey, you coming?
﻿Should we fix the tractor?
﻿Good morning.
﻿When you turn your back
to the house...
﻿the mountain top
is always in front of you.
﻿Then on the way home...
it is always right behind you.
﻿If it's cloudy and you can't see it...
﻿that's a good question.
﻿Then you listen for the river...
﻿because the river
runs down the mountain. Right?
﻿Then you just have to find the river...
﻿and then you will always
know the way home.
﻿Let's go see about those fishing nets.
﻿Hi!
﻿Ingvar!
﻿Ada!
﻿Ingvar!
﻿Ada!
﻿What?
﻿Ingvar...
﻿What... what is happening?
﻿What is happening...
﻿My love...
what is happening...
﻿What happened?
﻿Ingvar... what happened?
Where is Ada?
﻿My love.
﻿No.
﻿It will be ok...
﻿It will be ok.
