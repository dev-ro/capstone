Enough, let him rest.
I discovered
he lives in a city by the sea.
You overdid it.
He's drained out.
Where are you ?
- What time's the party ?
- Stella !
Didn't you see me ?
- Brando, cut it out !
- What's your costume tonight ?
Michele, your cell phone.
Your paper's blank, want to
repeat 9th grade like Casadio ?
I repeated 8th grade too.
The principal !
The inspector wants
a word with the class.
- Be seated.
- Hello.
I'll take just a minute.
Have any of you
seen Martino Breccia ?
Has something happened to him ?
He died jerking off.
Martino hasn't been home
for two days.
His mother went to wake him,
but he wasn't there.
His bed was made.
If you see him, or hear from him,
tell him to go home.
Good luck.
Inspector !
You forgot your snack.
Thanks, Mom.
Say goodbye to the inspector.
Teacher!
Where are you hiding ?
Shhh, don't let anyone hear us.
Miki, I'm the big, bad wolf.
- Cough up the money.
- His shoes.
- Disgusting !
- Give it back. I need it.
Or else...
your mommy will arrest us ?
Or you'll get dad to beat us up ?
Sorry, you don't have a dad !
Better than one in jail, idiot.
He got out yesterday.
I'm not an idiot.
You get a ten-second head start,
I'm generous.
- That's not fair !
- Ten, nine...
- Ten points !
- Too easy !
You stepped on a shit.
Mom, Miki's here.
See my stinger ?
Candela, please !
Hi, there's lasagna.
- Who made it ?
- Your mom.
I'm not hungry.
- What are you doing ?
- Go away.
I don't understand
the language of humans.
Halloween Party at my house I
Join.
Put that back.
I don't get it:
even if Superman wears glasses,
why can't they recognize him ?
What's that for ?
Who sleeps here ?
- It's for friends.
- What friends !
They're dangerous to touch.
What do you need ?
A superhero costume,
this is all I have.
Here it is !
What is it?
Xin-Xiao, Chinese superhero,
very famous !
- It's a bit...
- The cape's missing.
What are his powers ?
You'll find out.
It's me, I called to say I've gone,
because I'm fed up.
I'll be gone just a while,
don't worry.
It's the video Martino
sent his folks two hours ago.
Where did he film it?
It looks like
a train station bathroom.
Hear what the speakers say !
This tubby is a genius at school,
he's in the Math Olympics tomorrow.
Isn't it strange
he'd run away the day before ?
He's not lacking a father figure !
The word is "single" not "old maid".
See you tomorrow.
Monster, weren't you supposed to be
at Stella's party ?
- I'm not going, I suck.
- You suck ? 50 euros !
- What is it?
- A superhero, Chinese.
I bet it's the only one.
Get up, let me see.
Head up.
You're terrific !
It itches.
It's not easy being a superhero.
Flying here and there,
saving people in danger...
Like Dad ?
Yes, more or less.
He was a cop like me.
Did he save people in danger too ?
Go to the party or she'll be hurt.
Don't wait up for me.
Who am I '?
Marie Antoinette...
after the guillotine.
Silenzi, what are you dressed as ?
- Diarrhea ?
- It's a superhero...
Chinese.
Really ? I've been to China.
What's it like ?
I don't remember much, I was there
for a year when I was four.
- How long are you staying here ?
- I just arrived.
But I like it here, there's the sea.
Your attention please.
- What's that ?
- Ask him.
We copied it from his phone
after the teacher took it off him.
Is that true ?
Want to dance with us ?
Michelino !
Shut up !
Dumb Chinese costume,
what's your superpower ?
Make me disappear,
make me invisible !
Mario, what's wrong ?
Miki, are you ready ?
Monster, you'll be late.
Why are you under the bed ?
Mario...
why are you under the bed ?
Come out.
Come out !
Left early, M.
What's the matter ?
Is it this ? It's just a drawing !
Let's go.
Hello ? Mom, I can't now.
I'll call later.
And now ?
I'm a monster.
I'm a monster !
- Pierobon.
- Here.
Silenzi. Silenzi ?
Absent.
Silenzi absent !
- Volpi ?
- At the tennis finals.
Let's begin.
Casadio !
No, teacher !
He should be locked up !
I understand your resentment,
but his father
was just released from jail.
Perfect,
the father goes out, the son goes in.
What the fuck are you doing ?
How the fuck
could you lose that match ?
You shit in your pants,
you were scared.
Dad, something happened !
Walk home so you can think it over.
Want to play with me ?
Help !
I didn't do it !
I swear, Dad !
Get in, you'll get the rest at home.
Come on, girls.
Go shower.
Explain it to me,
I can't understand it on my own.
It's a miracle
you didn't get suspended.
Girls like to go by degrees.
Taking off your clothes comes...
last.
- What got into you ? What happened ?
- Nothing.
Let's go for chicken and chips ?
I'm not hungry.
Me neither... let's have a beer.
Mom ?
Nothing.
Up...
Minnella, what is it?
What ?
I'll be right there.
Brando Volpi has disappeared.
You feel wrong,
alone, almost invisible
to your parents,
to your friends too.
But kids, it's all normal, you know ?
There's nothing at all
wrong with you.
All your fears, your dejection,
are important feelings, even useful,
if you learn to understand them.
This Doctor Basili standing here,
just call me Giorgio...
what on earth is he here for,
a police psychologist ?
I'll tell you.
I'm hereto help you
understand yourselves better.
For instance,
your classmate Brando
left his parents a note
saying: "I want to be alone,
don't look for me".
And Martino asked his parents
the same thing.
What do you think,
why did they do it?
I was thirteen once myself...
Silenzi maniac
You get pimples, your voice changes,
you're no longer a child,
but not yet an adult.
I ran away from home three times.
I gave my mother white hair.
And yet, here I am.
Do you think
you need a valid reason
to run away
or can you do it
just to test yourself ?
What do you say ?
That kid must have
a valid reason to run off.
If spiders spit their webs
from their mouths,
why does Spiderman
shoot them from his wrists ?
- Candela, go downstairs.
- Why ?
- Your mom wants you.
- That's not true.
Please !
Will you let me get by ?
Bye.
Not a word, I'll explain.
Nothing, everything's okay.
If I take my hand away,
swear you won't yell ?
When I put the costume on
I didn't feel anything strange
or maybe I did, a little itching,
but because it's acrylic I
I think.
Maybe the power entered me
while I was sleeping.
- Does it go if you wash ?
- No.
Maybe they're magic pajamas.
If you wear them at night,
you're invisible in the morning.
Magic pajamas ?
Actually, it looks like pajamas.
Maybe, if you wear them a long time,
you stay invisible a long time.
When will you go back to normal ?
I don't know !
You're a superhero !
Sure...
You're The Invisible Boy
so now you have
to help people in danger.
Who can I help ?
I'm just a loser.
Martino Breccia, a sensitive,
overweight kid who, before
the Math Olympics, cracks
under pressure and runs away.
Then Brando Volpi, a mini champ
who suddenly goofs
right before his demanding dad.
Strangely, he hasn't been seen
since his defeat.
So you think,
these disappearances are...
Voluntary ?
It's not me saying that,
we have a video-message from Martino
and a note from Brando.
- There's not much guesswork.
- So, why were you sent ?
To keep social alarm down,
there's always the risk of emulation.
So, it's important to impart calm.
Okay ?
These powers...
are a curse I
Shit
Miki, are you home ?
Are you home ?
Not once...
Hello ? Hi, Mom.
I'm not working too much,
anyway it's not that. Not just that.
You know I haven't smoked
for twelve years, since Miki arrived.
He's the one I'm worried about.
He's edgy, strange, he's hostile !
He got into trouble yesterday
and today he's not home.
I told him to tell me when...
Yes, he has to !
Listen, do you think...
possibly, unconsciously,
he feels he was adopted ?
Wait.
Miki, is that you ?
No, nothing, I thought...
Who are you ?
A ghost?
An angel !
Or just the wind ?
Is that you ?
Let's see who can swing the highest.
Want to be my friend ?
I don't have many here.
My mother says
I shouldn't talk to strangers.
But in this case...
- Do you have a mother ?
- No.
Want a candy ?
It's the last one.
You can eat, can't you ?
Don't I scare you ?
No!
Oh no, I have training now.
I'll see you again, won't I ?
Soto speak !
- Okay ?
- Okay,
Bye.
. . Dreams" Shakespeare
I wanted to apologize for that...
That's okay.
- Did you come in ?
- Yes.
You scared me.
Where are you ?
You still have that sneeze ?
Are you cold ?
A little.
Are you ready for gym ?
What's the blanket for ?
- I was cold.
- Hurry up !
She always comes in without knocking.
I knew you'd be back.
Do you really exist ?
I think so.
If I close my eyes, can I see you ?
No.
Maybe I have to get closer.
Maybe... even closer.
I have to go !
Tell me your name at least.
You have to tell her.
You have to tell her.
You have to tell her.
What are you doing ?
I'm going to tell her.
We have to work on your alignment.
And you have to beat
your fear of voids.
Keep practicing,
I'm going for coffee.
- Want something ?
- No, thank you.
"What are you doing here ?"
"Taking Mario for a wee-wee..."
No, can't say wee-wee.
I was out with Mario !
What a coincidence.
Actually, I always come this way.
Can I walk you home ?
I'll walk you home.
Stella !
Put her down !
Put her down !
I was gone just a moment.
She's a minor
under your responsibility.
Just the time for coffee !
Are you alright? Does it hurt ?
I couldn't stop him.
You did even too much !
It's just a tiny fracture,
he'll be home tomorrow, like new.
He was good, he bit his wrist.
We'll find her, don't worry.
Okay ? Rest now,
I'll take care of you.
We're friends, Stella.
I want to go home !
You will, soon.
The test results aren't clear.
But first, we have
to ask you a few questions.
Well, Commander ?
It's not her,
we have to keep looking.
You must save Stella.
You must save Stella.
What ?
You were talking in your sleep:
"I must save Stella..."
- Where are you going ?
- No !
- What are you looking for ?
- My costume, it's gone !
- What are you doing ?
- Here it is !
- It shrunk !
- Does it still work ?
How do I know if I can't wear it ?
I'm cold.
Do I have to wait much longer ?
Maybe it works just for you.
I'm home.
Just a minute and I'll tell you.
I'll call you back.
You're awake ? I didn't sleep at all.
You washed my costume ?
- It stank !
- You ruined it.
I'll try to fix it. Ruined...
It can't be fixed, I hate you !
- Don't talk to your mother that way !
-She's not my mother...
You're not my mother !
So, you didn't run away.
The costume doesn't matter.
Yes, you've already seen me.
No, I didn't kidnap your friend.
How do you know what I'm thinking ?
Who are you ?
My name's Andreij.
And I'm your father.
My father's dead,
he was a cop, a hero !
That's what you've been told.
How do you imagine Russia ?
- Russia ?
- That's where I was born.
I had a normal life,
my family, friends.
Suddenly, everything changed.
There was a nuclear disaster.
Radiation killed many people,
made many more sick and,
in time, still others...
were changed.
Their DNA mutated.
They were called "Specials
The radiation had given them powers
which drew the interest
of a paramilitary group,
led by a general who was
nostalgic for the Cold War:
The Division.
They locked us away
in some place in Siberia
and used us as guinea pigs
for a long time.
They wanted to know how we worked,
to use us as weapons.
This one has no powers.
The tests are all negative.
Imagine an invincible army,
perfect weapons.
- Where is he ?
- Maybe he's invisible.
I was one
of their favorite guinea pigs,
the only one able to read minds,
but like all the others,
the more I used my power,
the more it consumed me.
Many got sick,
I started losing my sight.
The powers have a dark side.
One day you'll understand.
But there was another problem
for The Division,
all the Specials were sterile.
All of them,
except your mother and me.
I remember the day she arrived.
Yelena...
In her mind,
I felt a fear equal to my own.
But I saw something else too,
she liked me.
Then you were born,
the son of two Specials.
They were ecstatic,
but we knew
they'd have taken you from us,
so your mother and I
made a decision.
Hey, I'm here !
Your mother passed you her gift
and sacrificed herself for you.
I took you around Europe
and I always erased our tracks.
But I knew that sooner or later
I'd be caught,
so I chose the most peaceful place
for you to grow up.
I left you with Giovanna
who'd just moved into the city.
I read her mind
seeing she was a good person,
and she wanted a child
more than anything else,
and she'd have loved you.
It was easy for a cop
to get documents for you
and so, for everyone,
she became your mother.
No.
Don't think anything bad about her.
I'll think what I want,
stop rummaging in my head.
I can't stop.
- Can you read everyone's mind ?
- Those close to me.
Like that fisherman.
Right now he's wondering
if he should call the police,
with all these kidnappings of kids !
He'll decide in a moment,
we don't have much time.
He's not back yet ?
Let me know right away.
Is everything alright?
No, not at all, we should have
given the alarm right away.
I just knew they hadn't run away.
- Should have followed my instinct...
- And not listen to me ?
What's going on ?
Am I talking to the cop
or the psychologist?
You're talking to a friend.
Today Michele told me
I'm not his mother.
- Why ?
- Because it's true.
- I didn't know.
- No one did.
I don't know how he found out.
Can I trust you ?
I don't see why not.
Forgive me...
a call.
I don't have any power,
the costume gave it to me.
It unblocked your mind,
it would have happened anyway.
You're growing up.
Have you had nose-bleeds recently ?
- Yes.
- See, that costume means nothing.
The power is inside you.
I can't even control it !
You'll soon learn.
- What did you do to him ?
- I erased his memory.
Now he won't remember us.
It's not good
to go around naked in winter.
Your mother had the same problem.
So, they created this.
What is it?
This suit's cloth reacts
with your skin.
When you're invisible,
the suit is too.
Always wear it under your clothes
and consider it
a gift from your mother.
- And this ?
- It's the symbol of the Specials.
The Russian "S" is written like this.
Listen to me,
The Division knows you're here,
so run, I'll find you,
our minds are in contact.
They always have been.
It's crazy,
he says he doesn't remember a thing,
not the man, the kid
or even his call to us.
- What were you doing here ?
- Nothing.
You didn't see anything.
Never disappear
like that again, okay ?
Never again.
I'll go get Mario at the vet's,
you go home
and we'll talk when I come.
I'll take him home.
Yes, thank you.
They asked how I knew
I had gymnastic talent
and if I could do other things,
I said: "What things ?"
But they didn't answer.
I was asked the finite square root
of 131,071.
How dumb, there is no square root,
it's a primary number.
They asked me about tennis.
Maybe they're aliens,
masked as humans.
Maybe they can read our thoughts,
maybe even now !
Create a vacuum !
Don't think about anything !
Cut it out, tubby !
I'm not fat, my metabolism's lazy.
They know about us: that
you're good at tennis, that you...
You're a ball of lard !
Brando !
- You're good with numbers.
- And you can balance on a beam.
Right.
Maybe they're looking for kids
with particular talent.
Okay, but why ? What's it mean ?
That we have to escape.
Shall I make tea ?
Is everything alright here ?
- Sorry, you didn't answer.
- I didn't hear you.
Tea is ready.
Have your snack,
or I'll get an earful from your mom.
I know, you're at a difficult age.
Great changes,
we start discovering
the potential inside ourselves.
Cookie, come on !
And you ?
Have you started
discovering your potential ?
I need the bathroom.
I locked the door.
With all the brutes around...
it's best not to risk.
If you call the police,
your friends will die.
Open up, I don't want to hurt you.
Young Andreijvic !
You're like your mother.
We've been looking for you
for so long.
How long can you stay invisible ?
Do you feel pain
when you use the power ?
Headache, vomit?
You have to work on your aim,
young Andreijvic.
You already have excellent control !
We'll make you even better.
What could you do here,
among normal people ?
This is no world for you,
young Andreijvic,
they'd all think you were a monster,
instead, you're unique,
you're a Special.
Excellent idea, too bad !
Where are you ?
Ivan,go.
- What the fuck...
- Go, he'll kill us.
Young Andreijvic !
- Take off, it's an order.
- Yes sir !
- Tell me who the fuck you are !
- Wait.
I don't take orders
from a guy with no face.
Stop !
Are you done ?
Silenzi ?
Could you move more delicately ?
Shut up, tubby.
Quiet !
You're tickling me.
- What are you doing ?
- There's a mouse.
Maybe we'd better
forget the whole thing.
Hurry!
I've seen lots of psychologists,
but this guy...
He's a Russian spy !
He kidnapped Brando and Stella.
- A psychologist who kidnaps kids ?
- He's not a psychologist !
Not a psychologist? Then say so !
- Why do you go to psychologists ?
- Psychologists ?
- That's what you said.
- For the ADHD.
What's that ?
Attention Deficit Hypertension
Disorder, they say I have it.
- It's not true ?
- What ?
- That you have it !
- What ?
Forget it.
- So, this guy kidnapped Brando !
- And Martino and Stella too.
- And also Brando !
- Yes.
What's that ?
This is where we come
for our paintball fights.
This is a KingMan ETK4, latest model.
It gets you at 300 feet.
Those guys have real weapons.
You have to beat
your fear of voids I
- If they could say where they are.
- I'd find a way.
Meaning ?
- I'd make a signal.
- Sure...
Ivan, you're a genius !
- She turned it off.
- Someone else did.
- Meaning ?
- Forget it, let's go.
Wait !
Ready.
Let go of me !
- Stella I
- No talking on mission !
- How do I get up ? There's a guy.
- I have a plan.
Which is ?
Become invisible and be ready,
I'll do the rest.
I've been waiting
for this moment all my life.
- What's going on ?
- Problems with the control unit.
Take a look around.
Fuck!
What's going on ?
A problem with the control unit.
Nikolai went to check.
Nothing important.
Andreij, I knew you'd be back.
I'll give you an image of the woman.
They are also looking for the boy.
I knew Michele was special,
but not like this.
You've been an exceptional mother.
Michele is the most beautiful thing
that ever happened to me.
Take me to her.
Let go of me !
Everyone inside, immediately !
Open the cell.
Come on out.
You two, in there.
Fast !
They must have drugged me.
With something powerful !
Holy shit ! Silenzi ?
So, it was you.
I hope you're not disappointed.
Sorry, why not finish this
conversation outside ?
- Follow me !
- Wait !
There's someone else,
we have to free him.
- Not on your life !
- An old man.
I saw him when I tried to escape,
he's a prisoner.
Brando, take them outside.
- I'm coming too.
- No !
You don't know where he is, I do.
This way.
- This way !
- It's closed.
Let's try.
- See ?
- Take this.
Stop !
Wait.
He knows where Michele is.
This way.
You're sure ?
Yes, I think so.
This is the exit !
It's locked.
They locked us in.
He's here.
Show yourself, Andreijvic.
Stella... why ?
I'm not Stella.
You aren't?
I have a different name,
Claw.
When my mind claws another's,
there are no side effects.
Maybe a slight headache.
It's wasted time Michele.
You got away from me at your house,
but you can't escape here.
- You've never been to my house.
- Yes, I have !
I was him.
Shall I make tea ?
And I was your friend Stella.
Take me to the cell.
You're like me,
Michele.
We're two Specials.
I'm not like you.
Stop !
Think about your friend.
Basili... are you sure ?
- Yes, Michele told me.
- I can't believe it.
- The guards are gone.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
I don't like this at all.
Wait !
Michele's not here.
It's about to explode.
We're traveling.
We're finally going home.
You'll soon thank me,
as soon as you see your mother again.
That's not true.
You killed her.
No, it was them, the "Normals",
who hurt her,
but they didn't kill her.
Now The Division is ours.
Help !
We're in here !
Your mother is alive
and waiting for you.
Get back !
Now we'll put Stella
in the safety capsule
and we'll send her to the surface,
safe and sound.
Are you alright?
- Michele, Stella ?
- They went back.
- Let's go, hurry!
- It's about to explode !
Where's my son ?
I don't know.
I woke up in here,
I don't remember a thing !
- I don't believe you, where is he ?
- It's true !
Avoid, I don't even know
how I did this.
And my glasses are gone.
Giovanna, let's go.
Michele's no longer here.
He's telling the truth.
Left, stairs.
-Go!
"Run!
Get out of here !
Michele !
You have nothing in common
with these normal people,
with their normal, gray lives,
spent trying to balance accounts
that don't tally
and raise brats
who'll lead the same lives
as their fathers'.
We're your family,
your destiny.
Yes, show me what you can do.
Michele Silenzi.
No!
Your mother
will be very disappointed.
My mother is dead !
- And now ? Can you figure anything ?
- It should be this.
Should ?
Could we see that again ?
It must be a kind
of optical illusion, a mirage.
Everyone, there's no doubt,
from today on, our city too
has its superhero.
I'm sorry to tell you
that superheroes don't exist.
Quiet, your position
still hasn't been clarified.
- What ?
- He's not involved.
Good, you tell him.
Excuse me a minute.
- I know what you want to do.
- I have to.
- Why ?
- They all know you're a Special.
- Exactly !
- You'll always be in danger.
- I don't care.
- I do.
Your life mustn't be like mine.
I don't want things
to go back like before.
- My power will disappear ?
- It can't.
- Maybe you even have others.
- And you, you're leaving ?
I'll always know when you need me.
If they wanted me,
why did they kidnap Stella ?
This doesn't matter now.
What's important is that
no one remembers this night.
Just give me one minute, Dad.
Miki, I couldn't find you !
I'm confused, it's the most amazing
thing that ever happened to me.
To me too.
What's wrong ?
You'll forget me.
That's impossible.
Go to the others, I'll see you there.
What's that mean,
"I don't remember a thing" ?
It's all so confused...
How can you explain collective
amnesia ? You're a psychologist.
I just don't understand !
It's like I was possessed
by an alien force.
- Were you on that submarine ?
- Yes...
- I think so.
- You freed the children ?
Of course, even if
I don't know how it happened.
Then take all the credit
so we can end this business.
Congratulations.
Thanks to chief inspector
Giovanna Silenzi,
there's a happy ending,
but many questions,
to the disappearance
of the three boys...
- Even in the papers ?
- Your mother's a heroine.
They're safe, that's what matters.
Thank you, Mom.
She's proud of me, 1st time ever !
I know it was you.
By the way, monster,
you know
I'm taking you for pizza tonight ?
You've earned it after all you did.
- What?
- I know you got A in math.
How did you do it? You copied !
-No!

Sorry, I didn't see you.
Are you glad I'm back ?
Ivan, you're not really stupid,

Want to beat me up ?
Go ahead.
Then, with your permission...
Aren't you staying for the party ?
I don't want to celebrate

See you.

Want to walk together ?
Why not?
I'm worried about

Trick... let's call it that.

Special Andreijvic got away from us.
General...
We found young Natasha,
she's hidden in Morocco.
That's good news.
Go.

We're finally free.
