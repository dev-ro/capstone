[cow mooing]
[indistinct chattering]
Kiran! Instead of playing games
on your phone,
why don't you play something devotional?
[music playing]
-Padma!
-Hmm.
Adilaksmi didn't sweep properly.
There is still dirt all over the floor.
Ask her to sweep again.
Kondal Rao's breakfast isn't here
and it is soon going to be 7 o'clock.
-Call them.
-I'll take care of them,
but the cow seems
to be reluctant to poop.
-You should take care of that first.
-[mumbling] Damn these gatherings!
Not one job done properly!
Not even one! It's getting late.
Will the dung come anytime today?
We are getting late
and it didn't poop yet.
Did you feed it properly?
Sir, how can you say so?
I personally fed it last night.
Hey, Kiran.
Where are you going?
Uncle, I urgently need to
use the bathroom.
No one should use the upstairs' bathroom
until the cow starts pooping.
Go downstairs.
Use a stick to make it poop.
Oh, no! You can't prod it with sticks.
It has to be natural, sir.
Did I spend all that money
on you and your cow for this?
The auspicious time is getting nearer.
It's not so easy. No one can say exactly
when these things will happen.
I can. Every morning,
when my clock strikes eight,
I will be at it in my bathroom.
Then ask her the timings.
You should check that beforehand.
Uncle, don't pay him.
Huh! The cow is here,
so the fee must be paid.
Get out.
No pooping means no fee.
-We shall bring another cow.
-Wait, look, it is happening.
Now that the important thing is over,
let's not quarrel.
-Let's continue.
-Hmm.
[auspicious chanting]
[music]
[indistinct chattering]
[laughing]
[kids playing]
Hey! Hey!
Thank God!
Hey, girl! Hey, girl!
Kids these days!
Hey, boys! Someone please get me
some water. I'm thirsty.
The furniture moving
could have been done tomorrow.
Why did you take up
two tasks simultaneously?
Yes, but tomorrow I'd need
to hire help to move them in.
Whereas today,
we've got our people, isn't it?
-[singing]
-Venkatesh.
Yes, uncle.
-Go upstairs and pull the rope.
-Okay.
It will be over in an hour
if everyone does it.
Anyway, why are these steps so steep?
It's difficult for us to climb.
How can your mother climb them
with her knee pains?
-Hey!
-Yes, uncle. Tell me.
We need to haul my mother up
in the chair.
There is no issue.
Grandmother, will you please get up?
If you come near me,
I will break your legs, you morons!
Didn't I warn you about this?
-Do you think I am an almirah,
-We will take care of that, grandma.
-to hoist me up like that?
-Nothing will happen.
-Get up!
-What if I tumble off from there?
-Uncle, please tell her.
-Mother, we are here to take care.
It's just upstairs.
-Oh, God!
-Get up!
-No, listen to me.
-It's not too high. Come.
-Hey, Rahul!
-Yes, Father.
-Hold on to the rope and pull up.
-Okay.
-Don't worry, Mother.
-Pull it carefully.
Pull it properly.
Oh, God!
[chanting]
-Carefully. Don't worry.
-[reciting]
Brother, pull it carefully.
-She will kill me if she falls.
-Grandmother, you should lose weight.
[screaming]
[chanting]
To hell with you!
Pull it carefully.
MIDDLE CLASS MELODIES
-Keep that in.
-Hmm.
It's 7 a.m.
and the chutney isn't done yet.
Deliver the breakfast at lunch.
Mallikarjun Rao needs to get his parcels
and the house warming
function needs its catering.
Whenever there is a huge order,
the whole household moves
at a snail's pace.
It has been ages
since he started stirring.
You know that there will be a power cut
at 6 o'clock, right?
Who will do the other tasks if you are
still preparing that Bombay chutney?
You could have done them
instead of sleeping.
What will you do
if I have to do everything?
Do you think that I ran this hotel
for 30 years
sleeping through the mornings?
Now, stop the stirring
and do the seasoning.
Look, you don't have to tell me
how to prepare Bombay chutney.
Mind your work.
Don't give that bullshit.
Everyone knows that
you learnt it from your mother.
Stop shouting at him in the morning!
Don't take his side. I will put your head
in the grinder instead of chutney.
-Madam, milk.
-How dare you?
-You don't know about me.
-Yeah. The whole village knows about you.
If I say something,
both mother and son get angry.
Seems Kondal Rao is at it again.
We got used to it.
His voice serves as an alarm clock
for the whole village.
Anjaiah, what did you say?
Nothing. I was just saying that
your voice serenades everyone.
Hey! Are you ready?
Yeah!
Come fast.
Uncle, what's the delay?
Let's start serving the breakfast.
Excuse me.
[indistinct chattering]
[phone ringing]
Lakshmi, come here.
What is it?
It's Seenu.
Please talk to him.
Hello.
-Hello.
-Yeah, Seenu.
What is this, sister-in-law?
The breakfast is not here yet.
-Is he there?
-He is not feeling well.
But breakfast is ready. Raghava is on the
way, you will get them in half an hour.
-Okay, please make it quick.
-Okay.
He just creates a haste
without any reason!
Hey! We will come on the bike.
Follow us.
Okay, brother.
-Is everything loaded?
-Yes.
Be quick. It's already late.
They shouldn't be vexed.
Hey, go carefully.
Seems like you'll drop them on the road.
Stop pestering us.
Why don't you go and take a nap?
-You just irritate us!
-To hell with my sleep!
My back is hurting
due to this potholes.
We can go to Guntur happily
once these roadworks get completed.
We can't ignore it, Mr. Contractor.
The road we constructed till now
will go in vain.
Don't take it in a wrong way,
I am just being frank.
It's all out of my hands, sir.
The government is not responding.
Did you bring breakfast?
Uncle, didn't the workers come yet?
They are always late, just like this road.
Raghava, how are you?
Good, uncle.
Didn't I tell you about the delicious
Bombay chutney from our village?
He is the one who makes it.
He is Raghava.
Taste it and tell me how is it.
It tastes good.
Okay, uncle. We'll be off then.
Did you repair my phone?
Yeah. I'll bring it when I come home.
Okay, then.
Raghava, here's the money.
It's okay, uncle.
Father said that he will collect when he
sees you later at the chit fund auction.
You have to pay
for last time as well.
Done. So, are you headed to Guntur?
It's for your hotel, isn't it?
No. We have a function to cater there.
That's all.
Yeah, I know.
-Hey!
-Yes.
How does your uncle know
about my hotel business?
Did you blurt it out to him?
Yes, what is it now?
Of course, it doesn't matter to you.
What if my father learns about this?
I can imagine him shooting off
like a bottle rocket.
Your father fears that you might end up
bankrupt after starting a hotel in Guntur.
I too faced the same thing
when I wanted to start a mobile shop.
They said, "He has lost his mind.
No one will buy those China phones."
Only my uncle believed in me.
He helped me set it up
by paying Rs. 25,000 out of his pocket.
Now when anyone needs a phone,
they have no other option but my shop.
If your father bothers you again,
tell him about my success story.
I did.
He said, "Just because
someone finds urine tasty,
it doesn't mean that
you should give it a try."
Hell, you! Your father just blurts out
whatever comes to his mind.
Whatever! Let's go and search a space
for the hotel now.
I won't.
You search along with your father.
You guys can enjoy each other's company.
"It's morning and the town is ready"
"Guntur is all decked up and calling you"
"The war begun in the hubbub"
"Nobody is ready to back off"
"Guntur is one town you won't forget"
"The sun shows no signs of tiredness"
"Shirts are soaked with sweat all day"
"When the city is rich in so many things"
"Why do people see only the chilli?"
Rs. 70,000.
-What?
-What?
Why is it that much?
A hotel in a state's capital
doesn't come cheap.
They are saying
the capital is going to be shifted.
But it still hasn't shifted yet, has it?
Come back when they do it.
Hey. That's a wrong turn.
This is Guntur. It doesn't matter here.
Even the cops go in the wrong route here.
There are more autos
than people in Guntur.
"Walk these lanes
lined with haggling vendors"
"Enjoy mouth-watering mirchi bajji"
"With its sarees woven
from the fine thread as bait"
"Patnam bazaar calls us"
"Lemon rice dosa in Brodipeta"
"For tasty biryani, it's Subani Mama"
"For Brinjal fritter, it's 6th lane"
"For Gongura chicken, it's Brindavanam"
"For Masala Muntha, it's Sangadi Gunta"
"Maal Puri in Kothapeta"
"For Chitti idli in Laxmipuram"
"For Chakka Pakodi
at Moodu Vanthenalu"
"And if your stomach protests
after all this excess"
"The Sweet Basil Soda's hiss
will take care"
"When they serve with ghee
and chilli powder"
"The aromas make the mouth water"
"All you have to do is ask"
"You will never get dissatisfied"
"If the heart yearns for good food"
"Let's got to Guntur"
[indistinct chattering]
Hey! Looks like the tiffin is here.
Get up... Hurry...
Sister-in-law,
we are also planning to construct the
first floor to our house just like this.
-We are planning for two years...
-Finally, the breakfast is here.
-...let us see when it happens.
-Did they bring breakfast?
-Move aside, I'm hungry.
-Isn't it?
Move aside.
-Must be a diabetic. Serve him first.
-Serve me as well.
Move aside. I'm very hungry. Move.
Upma, bonda, idli...
[gasps] Where is the chutney?
Hey, Seenu! The chutney is missing.
-What?
-Where is the chutney?
Move, let me in.
-Oh, you hired a great caterer!
-To hell with him!
Is it that good?
I think it doesn't deserve
this reputation.
I can do a better job
with my chutney.
[people chattering]
Look around you.
Do you think people are fools
to fall for reputation without taste?
This place has been running since
before we were even born.
I think it's due to lack of competition
and options.
The same old chutneys
served in the same old way.
I will redefine taste when my hotel opens.
People will say Raghava introduced
Bombay chutney to Guntur.
[phone ringing]
Hey! It's my father.
Pick up or he will get suspicious.
Yes, Father.
Hello. Where are you?
-Ah...
-Hey! Say the bike got punctured.
I'm at the house warming function.
Then give the phone to your Seenu uncle.
What is it, Father?
Your voice is cutting off.
Hello...
-At the function?-Hello!
-You should have said a punctured tyre.-Hello!
-The bike's tyre got punctured...
-Hey!
I'll hit you with footwear.
You rascal!
I don't care where you are!
The chutney hasn't reached
and if you don't get it there
in ten minutes,
I will break your spine.
That auto idiot
forgot to deliver the chutney.
Hey! You didn't deliver the chutney.
Where are you?
No, sir. I have delivered everything.
There's nothing here.
Sorry, sir.
I didn't see under the seat.
Good job, useless fellow.
Now bring it here. Right now.
Okay, brother.
Should I bring it to Kolakaluru?
Not there, you idiot. To the function.
Okay. Disconnect the call. I'm coming.
We should have started our search
after the function.
Sandhya will be there.
You know that I can't face her now.
[people chattering]
Sorry, uncle. Our bike got punctured.
-Alright, go. Everyone is waiting.
-Sorry.
-You also go.
-You go first.
You also go and serve for yourself.
[people chattering]
Do you want more?
Raghava, is it true that you are looking
for a place for your hotel?
Yes, uncle.
I heard from Rahul.
I have a shed.
Do you want to check it out?
It would suit a hotel perfectly.
It is right in the middle
of the market.
Take it only if you like it.
Ok, uncle.
I will see it.
Then come to my house after the function,
I will show you the place.
Pour some chutney.
Enough.
-How are you, brother?
-I feared he would recognize us.
What did he want?
He wants to show me
some shed of his for my hotel.
That's good.
Not good. I don't like Sandhya thinking
that I am doing all this for her.
Hi, Krishna. How are you?
I'm good, Gopal.
Why did you come so early?
-Do you want some new phones?
-We can order the same Yellow phone
if you want.
Heard that you had a daughter.
Goddess Lakshmi came to your house.
Thank you. Even my mother...
-Can you show me any of the new models?
-Alright.
-Hey!
-Yeah?
Stop following her movements
like a creepy sunflower.
Okay.
[clears throat]
Hey! Wipe that smile off.
Is it that obvious?
Yeah.
These are the new ones.
-Yeah, we will take them all.
-Okay.
Sir.
Oh, seems like
I forgot the money, Krishna.
I'll buy them later.
Hey! I have the money.
Did I ask you?
I will come later, Krishna.
No problem, Gopal.
You are a regular customer.
You can pay later.
No problem, Krishna.
I will be coming back anyway.
I'll buy it then.
See you later, Krishna.
-Girl, keep them inside.
-You are so cunning.
Stop it.
Hey! You will get a break
only when you learn it.
Sandhya, see if he has done it.
Friction is a force
that opposes the motion.
-Friction...
-Tell me.
Friction... Friction that...
[doorbell rings]
Hey! Let's go back.
He doesn't remember us. Don't worry. Hey!
Hi.
Raghava. Come in.
Uncle asked me to come.
He said that there is a shed
I could check out.
He is still in the office.
Raghava is here for the shed.
How is that shed suited for a hotel?
There used to be a barbershop, right?
He will take care of those things.
-He is not a kid.
-Oh, no!
Don't shout!
This phone doesn't work without a speaker.
Looks like you are going
to hash up this whole deal.
Give him the phone.
Let's just see it once.
We will decide later.
Uncle is on the phone.
He wants to speak with you.
-You take it.
-Hello, uncle.
Raghava, I've some work in
the office and couldn't come.
I will give you the address,
take the keys and check the place out.
It's the third lane in Donka Road.
You will see a Sai Baba temple there.
I am not too familiar with Guntur, uncle.
Is that so?
Uh... Is Sandhya there?
For Sandhya.
Sandhya?
Sandhya?
Your father.
Father.
Take Raghava and show him our shed.
Me?
There is no problem.
He is like a brother to you.
Why is this so shabby?
Okay, I will check the surroundings,
meanwhile, you talk with your brother.
Hey, kiddo. Come with me.
-Let's go that way.
-Okay, uncle.
Uncle! Who here looks like your uncle?
-Which grade are you in?
-I'm in sixth grade.
Don't worry.
I will say that I didn't like the shed.
I came here just for formality
because I said I would check it out.
I think I have seen you somewhere.
That can't be true.
This is my first visit to Guntur.
I don't want the shed, uncle.
What? You didn't like it?
It's just that there's a tree
blocking the view.
Also, the location
is in some far-flung corner of the city.
I mean...
You are the first one to say
that you didn't like the shed.
Once the business gets rolling,
everyone will start calling it
the "Hotel-behind-the-tree."
What's your budget?
I'm thinking of taking a lease.
Somewhere around four.
Four? For four lakhs
you wouldn't even get my shed.
This is Guntur, not Kolakalur.
Look, I am telling you all this
because I care for you.
I can easily get a lease
at 25,000 a month that is six lakhs.
But because it's you,
I will give it to you for five.
For both, rate and place,
this is a double bonanza for you.
No, uncle.
We decided not to take the place.
-Listen to me...
-We'll leave.
[gate creaking]
Scribble in something.
-Are you done with your exam?
-Yeah.
[people chattering]
How was it?
Superb.
You?
Yeah, right!
Will you stay here for a while?
Why? Do you have something to say?
Nothing, just casually.
What is next?
Vacating the hostel and going home.
I mean, what is next with your education.
There is no hope in EAMCET.
I may join degree. What about you?
I don't know.
Whatever my father decides for me.
Who knows how long it will be
before we meet up again.
Is there a need to meet again?
"Sandhya..."
"Is it the shyness that is stopping you?"
"Brother-in-law..."
"Is that what you want to
call him but hesitate?"
"You just have to stay strong,
steady and straight"
"Everything will fall
in line automatically"
"Adolescence cannot be trusted,
show some courage"
"The fate will get its happy ending"
"Do you even know"
"How far or how close is he to you?"
"Do you even like floating"
"In this limbo of love?"
"You stuffed your feelings in your heart"
"When will you let them out?"
"Time to end your friendship with shyness"
"It's a sin, when will you realize this?"
"Sandhya..."
"Is it the shyness that is stopping you?"
"Brother-in-law..."
"Is that what you want
to call him but hesitate?"
Raghava.
It's a friendship band.
Call me "bava".
-Uh-huh!
-Then forget it.
"The love you think you are expressing
is not enough"
"Just staring at him
won't help you anyway"
"He looks brash from the outside"
"But he secretly likes you"
"Just take your aim and hit him
with your love arrow"
"He will be at your feet
in the next moment"
"Sandhya..."
"Is it the shyness that is stopping you?"
"Yes"
"Your sweetheart is
the personification of arrogance"
"You just have to stay strong
steady and straight"
"Everything will fall
in line automatically"
"Adolescence cannot be trusted
show some courage"
"The fate will get its happy ending"
Raghava.
Huh?
I want to say something.
Tell me.
The thing is...
Say it.
The thing is, I...
You... Tell me.
[scooter arrives]
-How did you do in your exam?
-Good.
Get on.
Hey! Stop.
She went inside.
[television playing]
How did you do in your exam?
It went well, Mother.
Kamala, make some coffee.
There is no milk. Go and bring some.
Mother, I am going to Yamini's house
to discuss the exam.
[door creaking]
Look, she came.
-She might be asking us to come there.
-Get on.
Wait here.
Raghava, what are you doing here?
You were about to say something?
It's not a good time now.
Please, leave.
It's okay. Tell me, Sandhya.
I want to hear
what you were going to say.
-Tell me, please.
-Raghava.
Everybody in this locality knows me.
-Listen to me.
-Don't worry, Sandhya.
I know what you were going to say.
Just say it. I will say accept it.
Raghava, not at this moment.
-Just say it. I will say accept it.
-It will be a problem.
Oh, no!
-Listen to me. Nothing will happen.
-We'll talk later, please.
-Please, understand.
-Hey! Her father is coming.
Raghava, my father. Please, go.
I love you too, Sandhya.
-Urgh!
-Hey! Let's go. Paddle it faster.
[television playing]
Useless piece of shit!
You can't do one thing right.
You have become a living nightmare for us.
-Shucks!
-What's the matter now?
Ask him. Ask him where he was
when he was supposed to be
at the function.
Mother, I want to start my hotel
in Guntur.
I don't want to get stuck
in the same place my whole life.
What is it you want to do in Guntur?
Twenty-five years of age
and a brain worth a rat's pellet.
Cool down and hear him out.
What's there to hear?
I had to listen to Seenu
while he insulted me.
I had to suffer with that idiot
for something he did.
To hell with his Guntur!
Yes. I will go to Guntur. So what?
I make delicious Bombay chutney
and is anyone here even eating it!
Our hotel is a meeting point
for everyone to come and shoot the crap!
Stop building castles in the air.
It is not that easy in Guntur.
There is a hotel
in every corner in Guntur.
Even if there are, it doesn't matter.
None of them makes Bombay chutney.
I believe in myself.
I also equally believe that
I cannot grow in this village.
You have already grown 6 feet
like a bamboo. What more do you want?
Shucks!
Hey! Eat something and go.
I have prepared food for you, too.
Give it to a beggar tomorrow.
Do the seasoning and serve the same meal
to him tomorrow.
Will you both stop for a moment?
You don't know how to talk
and he doesn't know how to take it.
I am fed up with your quarrels.
I feel like I should leave you guys.
Listen, these legs are killing me.
Would you come and massage them?
This song is from
"Samsaram Oka Chadarangam."
Mother, bring some onions.
And uncle, everyone in the village
is talking about the road.
Saying that Mallikarjun Rao
is keeping his word and standing firm.
Yeah, and all this standing
is hurting his legs.
Who asked him to make a promise?
What happened, uncle?
Halfway through the project
the government stopped giving funds.
Frankly, the work was stopped.
To keep the work going,
I have to dig into my pocket.
The chit fund business was better
than politics.
Politics are for those
who have a thick hide,
and we know how soft you are.
Come on, this is the difference between
those ordinary politicians and uncle.
His horoscope is not an ordinary one.
I have seen it personally.
He will live on for 80 years.
He won't stop at being a president.
Even his horoscope says
he will become an MLA.
I'm sure he will make a great MLA.
Are you pulling my leg?
It's true, uncle.
Come to the shop tomorrow.
I will show you your horoscope
on my computer.
Gopal, stop giving him false hope,
-or I will skin you alive.
-I'm leaving.
Do you want to become an MLA?
Eat your roti first.
To hell with his MLA!
[dog barking]
Will you have some idly, Mr. Murthy?
No, thanks, Kondal Rao.
I already ate at home.
This Trump's insanity
seems to be escalating day by day.
Is he crazy?
You are concerned
because your son is living there, teacher.
It's all talent. Those people
don't work as hard as our people.
But, why will they not resist our people
taking away their jobs despite the talent?
These are just an exemption
but there is politics underneath!
Jobs are an issue
created by Trump for local votes...
He's got no dearth of pride!
"I have no problem with you setting up
a hotel in our shed. Sandhya!"
I thought there was something like this
when you came to me early in the morning.
So, it's all good, isn't it?
Anyway, may be Sandhya might think...
Hey! Whose loss is it going to be?
She texted you that she doesn't
have a problem, didn't she?
Go set up your hotel if you like it.
I don't like that shed.
Okay, I will take it.
Alright, your father is yet
to stamp his approval.
Mother, are you feeling alright?
Nothing as such. I was just lying down.
Wash your hands, I'll serve food.
I had my dinner. Did you eat?
Yes, but...
Are you taking
that Nageshwar Rao's shed?
He called your father.
Did father say anything?
Why so serious? Huh?
Do you think you are a bigwig
to get things easily?
Is it? When have I got something I wished
for easy in this house?
What did we deprive you of then?
Where did she keep the damn oil bottle?
Okay. Let's not start in front of him.
Go and sleep. We will talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Yeah, it's here.
-You've become old already.
-Hmm.
The doctor specifically said
not to sit on the floor.
But you won't listen.
When have you and your son
ever listened to me?
Keep your voice down.
I'm too tired to mediate a fight.
Why? Has he grown old enough
to start his own hotel?
Ouch! Be gentle.
Of course, he has grown up.
You were the one saying
that he should get serious with life.
Now, he is trying something on his own.
He should mind his business, shouldn't he?
Yeah, ask him to arrange
the money as well.
I'm not giving him any of mine.
Yeah, like you have
a treasure hidden somewhere.
Do you remember what you said
when we came here 30 years ago?
You said, "Your father didn't
give you anything,"
"and my father didn't save anything."
Didn't you say that it would've been nice
if someone gives us a leg up?
Isn't it only fair for him
to expect the same from his parents?
I'm just looking out for him.
It seems I always turn out to be
the villain but no one understands me.
Anyway, just give him the chit fund money
so that he can pay the advance.
I won't.
Why did you massage just one leg? Come.
Nope. I'm sleepy.
Oh, no!
It's hard convincing some people.
We will manage. Go take a shower.
Hot water is ready.
Ready? Now pray to God.
No!
Take this. Go and pay the advance
to Nageshwar Rao.
What's with this sudden change?
Did God come in your dreams
and tell you to help me?
It's us who has to help you.
How does it matter to you
when the money is not yours?
We think before acting.
We should think of the pros and cons
before investing in something.
Now go and pay.
Ouch! Careful with the money, you moron!
It's great that
your father agreed to it, Raghava.
Yesterday he was singing a different tune.
It's just that one has to think twice
with such costly affairs.
But this is a good decision.
Businesses are always better than jobs.
But the advance stays with me,
there is no returning it.
It's just that we want to build
a portion on top
so that we lend it out for rent.
I'm planning to build it with
your remaining payment.
There's money coming in next week.
We will pay off the rest then.
Alright.
-We will leave then.
-Alright.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Krishna, how's your Lakshmi?
She is fine, Gopal. How are you...
Why do you even ask me?
Hi.
Tell me.
Can you show me some good phone
in the range of Rs. 400?
There are no phones for Rs. 400.
Starting price is Rs. 700.
-Is that okay?
-No problem.
Check these.
-Is the voice clarity fine in these?
-Yeah.
I need to speak with you,
can you come outside?
How much is this?
Rs. 2,000.
-Must be a camera phone.
-Yeah.
The colour reproduction
isn't bad, right?
I will be at the cloth store.
I recently bought a camera phone
on Krishna's recommendation.
Blue dress became black in the photos.
My customers are complaining.
Okay, I will take these later.
Bye, Krishna. Don't forget.
The cloth store outside.
[vehicles honking]
Krishna, it's just...
Can you show me those phones again?
Okay.
Why didn't you come? Are you angry?
Which phone did you like previously?
The whole street is filled
with cloth stores.
Which one should I come to?
-Venkateswara Fashions.
-Hmm.
Keep this model aside.
See you, bye.
[vehicles honking]
Gopal.
Sorry. Hi.
Come inside.
Hi.
So, what is it?
It's just that I wanted
to ask you something for a long time.
Is that so?
Yes.
Even I wanted to say something to you.
Is it? What is that?
No, you first.
That is... I don't know
how to bring this up.
But if you don't mind...
Can I have your date of birth?
16th January 1995.
-Okay, thanks.
-Why do you want it?
Never mind. It's nothing.
I'll tell you later.
-Ms. Gouthami.
-Yeah?
You didn't tell me the time of birth.
7:30 a.m.
Okay, thanks. Bye.
[bike starting]
What did he say?
Did he propose?
No! He asked my date of birth.
So he wants to set the date
for the marriage.
I wish you were right.
Of course, it's the only way.
I can't leave my family in this situation.
I should take care of them
even after getting married.
I went to tell him all that.
But he left without even listening to me.
I think Gopal will understand
your situation.
Gopal is so much better than
the auto driver your father arranged.
[people chattering]
January 16th at 7:30 a.m.
Eight?
Online horoscope.
I'm going for the chit fund auction,
do you need any vegetables?
-No, we already have it.
-Okay.
[indistinct chattering]
Hey!
What did you talk to her yesterday?
That's personal.
Just say what happened.
Leave it be.
Why should we bother about it?
-These things don't work out.
-Hey!
Stop blabbering and come to the point.
I didn't talk much with her.
I just asked for her date of birth.
What, idiot?
Aren't you ashamed?
Are you even educated?
She may have been hurt.
Stop it. What did I do to hurt her?
Did I ask for her caste
or did I ask her to go out with me?
I just wanted to check if our horoscopes
match for marriage.
They didn't match and I left it at that.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing's wrong.
You are just too great.
-I know. Now give me two more bondas.
-You!
Raghava, bring me two idlis.
Raghava, I heard that
you are shifting to Guntur?
Yes.
Is it?
Why do you want to do that?
Going to the city has now become
a fashion among the youth.
What's wrong with this place?
What's great about this place to like?
Not even one of you dirty faces
come here to eat.
You read newspaper and chit-chat
for two hours and eat just two idlis.
Drat!
What's the use to cook for someone
who doesn't even eat?
And if it weren't for the newspaper,
half of you wouldn't come here.
What are you talking about?
Don't forget that your father's roots
are in this same place.
That's why he is rooted in the same spot
with no growth of any sort.
Our lives would've been different
if it was another place.
I increased the dosa's rate by Rs. 1
and you were all complaining.
I mean, who has ever heard
of five-rupee dosa?
Go to Guntur,
the prices will knock you senseless.
Did any of you ever properly eat
my delicious Bombay chutney?
You will know my value
once I go to Guntur.
Idiots!
Raghava! Look over there.
[breaths heavily]
-Kondal Rao.
-Father, what happened?
That bastard Mallikarjun Rao
has disappeared
along with the chit fund money.
-Oh, no!
-Yeah!
Nobody knows where he is.
His family doesn't know
his whereabouts.
The money doesn't matter to them.
-Calm down.
-Drink some water.
-Drink some water.
-I won't spare him!
Kondal Rao, why are you so aggressive?
You will know
when you lose 6 lakh rupees.
Raghava, this anger isn't good
for your father.
If you can't control your aggression,
your blood pressure will result
in a cardiac arrest!
You will lose another 6 lakh
for the surgery.
-Hell with the surgery!
-Father.
-Why don't you listen to me?
-Raghava, let's go.
This thing has to be cleared up
once and for all.
-Why are you behaving like this?
-Come.
At least take your shirt.
Uncle, Kondal Rao is getting into a brawl.
Come, let's watch.
Is it?
Let's go.
Wait a moment!
You bastards!
I saved every penny of mine
for my granddaughter's education
and you stole it.
-Hey, Anjaiah!
-What?
Shut up with your drunk ramblings
and keep in mind who you are talking to!
Hey, stop it! I am fully aware
that I am talking to a thieving bastard.
-Get lost!
-Hey! What's your problem, Anjaiah?
Our family is distraught
over the disappearance of my father
and you're making a scene.
Your problems are insignificant to us
as ours are to you.
-No one else can understand your problems!
-Your money is in safe hands.
What if my father isn't here?
Aren't we here to pay the debts?
-Do we seem like thieves?
-Hey!
If someone has something to say
then it should be Mr. Kondal Rao.
He's owed 6 lakh,
and yet he is calm.
To hell with your 1 lakh rupees?
Even he created
a big scene moments ago.
To all those here,
I'll return your amount with interest
once my father returns.
-Is it?
-Understand?
I will return.
Hold on, listen to me.
-Anjaiah.
-Yes.
-Meet me after a month.
-What?
Meet me after a month.
A month, is it?
-Yeah, we shall see that!
-Damn my life!
Having to put up with these men.
We shall see that!
Just wait and see what I will do
if you don't pay me back in a month.
All my dreams crumbling in a single day!
Damn!
And I can't believe
that your uncle absconded.
How can Surendra arrange so much money
in one month? Poor guy.
What about my hotel now?
Will someone lend us money?
No one.
Things are now beyond our control.
Forget about the hotel.
Just like a lake dries up when an
unlucky guy goes to wash his body,
this idiot is of no benefit to me,
all he incurs is a loss.
The moment he mentioned his hotel
in Guntur, we've lost all our money.
What's his fault in this?
Don't blame him for everything.
No further discussion.
Forget about Guntur and the hotel!
Your only option is to stay
and work in the village. Else, sit idle.
You're well aware of it, aren't you?
How can you say that?
We paid the advance, right?
Forget about it! What more is there
to lose for a guy who's lost everything.
I'll just think that I lost
another Rs. 50,000 on him.
You are talking senseless!
Where am I supposed to bring
in the money from?
Shall I sell my soul to the devil?
You need not lend me the money.
We can sell our land in Santha Magaluru.
What?
I'm saying the land...
I will beat you senseless
if you mention the land again.
You don't understand...
That's the only property we have.
You can forget your hotel.
No point in talking to him.
He will sell us too for his selfishness.
You should share part of the blame.
I kept saying that you shouldn't keep
all your eggs in one basket.
You invested all the money with him saying
that Mallikarjun Rao is trustworthy.
Now he cheated us!
How would I know that Mallikarjun Rao
would do such a thing?
[indistinct chattering]
We wouldn't have faced this day
if you had listened to me!
If you really think I am selfish.
then I don't need
the Guntur hotel anymore.
I will stay here and look after our hotel.
Dear...
I'm not saying this
because I'm upset.
I've thought about it.
You don't need to fight for it.
-What's this?
-[goat bleating]
Dear, how are you planning
for this year's temple festival?
What does he know?
How much is the festival's estimated cost?
-We aren't sure about it.
-Sir.
I was drunk and spoke very badly
the other day. Forgive me.
I know that 1 lakh isn't much to you,
-but it's a huge amount for us.
-Damn, my life!
Not a moment's peace! Every bastard wants
to drill in life lessons.
Sir.
[birds chirping]
-Anjaiah.
-Yes, sir.
How are you arranging
your granddaughter's college fees?
I can't figure it out, sir.
-Why?
-No one is ready to lend me the money.
Things would have been different
if her parents had been alive.
I have no other choice, but to stop
sending her to college.
Oh, no! You are uneducated
but your granddaughter studies well.
Let her study.
I'm lending you. This is my pension
money and you have to return it.

-Hello!
-Brother-in-law, it's me, Nageshwar Rao.
Bloody scoundrel! Why the hell did he do
such a terrible thing?
Come to the point.
It's just that Raghava's advance
is still with me,
many people are asking
if the shed is still available.
-Sell it.
-[gasps]
What did he say?
We shouldn't have bought
all this construction material.
"Lord Shiva,
we'll never know your greatness"

Why don't you get in my auto for once?

what's your problem?

-Yeah, I'm coming.

Is there any news
of Mallikarjun Rao's whereabouts?
Not yet, brother. Gopal and Surendra
are trying their best.
A few of them are saying that
he stole the money and absconded.
Who said that?
All that money was put
into the road repair.
We haven't used anybody's money
for our personal use.
Damn you!
I kept telling him not to take
the project personally.
But he didn't listen to me!
Nobody listens when it
has to happen in our fate.
He trusted that contractor.
He gave him all his own money
along with the chit fund money.
He wanted to ensure the roads
are constructed properly.
But the contractor absconded
with the fund money when it came.
He never breaks his promise.
Stop crying.
-Please control yourself.
-This is not the time to discuss all this.
We should first find where he is.
Nageshwar Rao, did you sell the shed?
Hold on to it.
We have an acre of land
in Santha Magaluru.
We will sell it off and pay up the rest.
Where in Santha Magaluru?
-Are you aware of the malachamma tree?
-Father.
-Yeah!
-100 meters from there. But why?
I will call you back.
I said I am done
with the Guntur business, didn't I?
Then what is this?
I don't want you to sell that land.
Why do you get so irate?
You should not take everything to heart.
We elders say many things.
How can you get so retrogressed
for such a small thing?
We have thought about it thoroughly.
Now keep quiet.
[phone ringing]
Yes, brother-in-law.
What price do you expect
for this land to get sold for?
Someone offered six lakhs for it.
It would be more than six.
Look, you will sell it to someone else,
he will pay you for it
you will pay me that money
for the shed...
Why all this hassle?
How about selling the land to me?
I will give you the shed in return.
We can keep the property in the family
by doing so.
What do you say?
Fine. Let's do it that way then.
Alright, then.
Let's mark up a good day
for you to go to Guntur.
[indistinct chattering]
-Brother-in-law, I'm here.
-Okay.
[indistinct chattering]
Why are you so late?
-Come, Raghava.
-Yeah, uncle.
Did you learn something
about Mallikarjun Rao?
No.
How's Lakshmi?
It's been a while since I saw her.
She's good.
-Come to the house when you are in Guntur.
-Okay.
I am tired of sweeping
with these cement bags in the house.
You can do it yourself from tomorrow.
All this housework will come in handy
once you marry.
We can get the construction started
once the registration is over.
But father needs cash for construction.
What's that got to do
with the registration?
Money can be arranged easily
by taking a loan.
But getting good land is not easy.
Moreover, there is a highway
coming there.
Your father learnt it from his office.
The land value will increase
ten-fold it seems.
Isn't it good to buy it when it's cheaper?
What are you saying? Is it true?
What do I get lying to you?
Now, come and cut the vegetables.
Oh, no!
[line ringing]

Where are you going now? Sit down.
Gopal.

Hello.
-Hello.
-Who is this?
Is Gopal there?
He's taking a shower.
Who's this?
I'm Sandhya, aunty.
Sandhya? What do you want from Gopal?
It's urgent. I'm Gopal's friend.
Wait a minute then. Gopal.
Gopal.
Yes.
Someone called Sandhya is on the line.
Sandhya?
Why is she calling me?
Tell her I'll call back.
He said that he'll call back...
Why did the call drop?
[line beeping]
You have insufficient balance
to make this call.
Mother, where's your phone?
Your father took it to get it repaired.
-Come and cut the vegetables.
-Urgh!
Where are you going?
Mother, I've some urgent work,
I have to go.
What's more urgent than
peeling a ridge gourd?
Do you know Yamini, my junior?
She called me
that she reached the centre.
I'll give her my book and come back.
You have a phone in your hand
but where's the book?
I forgot.
Hey!
Mother, why don't you tell all at once
instead of troubling me?
Is that how you dress
when you go out?
-Change your clothes and go.
-Urgh!
This girl has gone nuts!
Move aside. Move, move.
Nageshwar Rao, you're up next.
-Come.
-Brother-in-law, it's our turn next.
-Uncle, I need to recharge urgently.
-One.
-Uncle, I need to recharge urgently.
-Two.
Write down your number there.
Uncle, there's no time.
Please, I'm in a hurry.
Wait a minute.
Kids these days are always in a hurry...
Now, where's my phone?
-Uncle.
-Yeah!
What's the number?
9880362...
Nine...
-Urgh! Nine.
-Hmm.
-Eight.

Hello, sir.
[phone chimes]
[keypad beeping]
[line ringing]
-Hello, Gopal.
-Sandhya, I was about to call you.
Oh! What are you saying?
Your father is so cunning.
Okay, I'll try to reach Kondal Rao uncle,
you try Raghava's phone.
Here it is, sir.
This is the land, sir.
[phone ringing]
Answer it.
Sorry, sir.
Urgh!
[phone ringing]
Hello, Gopal.
He is also not picking up.
Keep trying Raghava's phone.

PICHHIDI (mental)
Someone named "Mental' is calling.
-Why did you name so?
-It's an apt description, uncle.
-Twelve.
-Damn!
[indistinct chattering]
[phone ringing]
Hey, Sandhya!
Why did you call me so many times?
I was sandwiched between your father
and my father and hence I couldn't pick.
Was it urgent?
Is the registration over?
Yes. Just now.
I'm outside the office.
I called to stop it.
Stop it? Why?
What are you saying, Sandhya?
Is it true?
Oh, no! I am a dead man
if my father knows this.
Why did you call me as if
there is something urgent?
You know that I'm busy here
at the registration office, don't you?
I'll kick your ass
once I get back to the village.
Did Gopal say anything?
To hell with him!
There will be nothing important.
He must have got some new film print.
Useless idiot!
[song playing]
Hey! Take these as well.
Kondal Rao, is it true that your son
is going to Guntur?
[phone chimes]
Forward this photo to ten people
in ten seconds
and you will hear a good news.
Kondal Rao, don't you own some land
near Santha Magaluru?
Yes, why?
It's mentioned in the paper.
Is it? What is the news?
Looks like there is going to
be a highway coming there,
which would increase the price
of it by ten times.
-Is it?
-What are you saying?
5 lakhs worth land
will now be worth 50 lakhs it seems.
Looks like Kondal Rao has hit jackpot.
Hey! Get on and start the vehicle.
-There are still things to load up.
-Hey, Gopal! Get in!
-What happened?
-Hey! You, damn, get in!
[engine starts]
-Move.
-Hey!
You scoundrel! Stop it! Hey, stop!
Stop!
-Hey!
-Oh!
Hey, stop!

No problem.
Sorry.
I have troubled you several times.
It's alright, "bava".

Look, I can't tell what you are thinking.
But I didn't expect that
the land price would increase.
This is the truth.
You must believe me.
Though I am not as smart as you,
I'm not a freaking dimwit, Nageshwar Rao.
-Hey... Hey...
-I understand everything.
Why do you talk in such a manner?
What I told you is the truth.
What did I say?
I'm just stating facts.
Look, the people who siphoned off
others' money will be doomed.
-Listen to me. Come inside...
-You will perish.

I think you've passed them to me.
Check this guy, dear.
Who is he, father?
Why are you showing this?
Give me the phone.
He looks good like a statue.
He is an assistant engineer
in our R and B Department.
Even his father worked in my department
and got retired.
Oh! Then they must have made good money.
A couple of plots in Eluru Road
and a house in Bandar road. Well off!
Father, why now?
I want to get a job.
Job? Let's ask them.
It would be better if they allow you
to work after the marriage.
But... Father...
The proposal came just now.
There would ample time in-between.
Everything has to work out
for a marriage to happen, right?
Sir, have some hot and tasty idli
at our hotel. Please, sir.
-Please leave me. I had.
-Please, sir.
-We've got Bombay chutney as well.
-I had breakfast.
Sir, our hotel is very famous.
-Please come to our hotel, sir.
-Where is the hotel here?
Over there, sir.
Please come and have breakfast.
I already had my breakfast.
-You can manage a second breakfast, sir.
-Hey!
-Shiva.-Sir.
Is the name of our hotel
visible from a distance?
I can only see "tre"
from "Raghava Tiffin Centre", sir.
That's why nobody is coming here.
Let's do something, sir.
We shall cut down the tree.
No. Go and stand over there.
See now.
Do you see the name now, Shiva?
What about now?
I can't see anything, sir.
Yeah! Now it's clearly visible, sir.
Fool! Stand up and see properly!
It's this branch.
Hacking it off will solve the problem.
I'm coming down.
This tree is irritating me, Sandhya.
I'm only tolerating it
because of the shade it gives.
Come and have a seat.
Not a single soul is turning up.
Will you have an egg dosa?
-Master.
-Yes.
My father brought a wedding match for me.
Why is this all of a sudden?
It's all because of that land you sold.
Since its value
has increased exorbitantly,
he wants to sell me off with that.
Oh, no! Please don't remind me
of the land, Sandhya.
What do you want to do now?
I had decided on the very day of learning
the Bombay Chutney recipe from my mother
to open up a hotel in Guntur
when I grow up.
But I always had a fear of failing
by doing something I am passionate about.
I overcame that fear because of you.
Why are you surrendering now?
Can't you tell your father
that you don't like that match?
Why doesn't anyone ask me
what I like?
You didn't care to ask me
before kissing me.
And now, my father is doing the same.
He doesn't talk to me properly
since then.
He always looks at me as if I'm someone
who has made a mistake.
It's because of me.
[sniffles]
Let bygones be bygones. We shall think
of what to do now, Sandhya.
-Can I get some coffee?
-Okay.
Father.
The groom's parents called me.
They are coming to see you.
Fath...
Get the phones
mentioned in this list, Krishna.
I'll come by to pick them up later.
Okay, Gopal. I'll get them.
Gopal.
-The thing is...
-I'm sorry. I like you.
I wanted to come
and talk to your parents
if our horoscopes matched.
-But...
-Ah...
Things won't work out between us.
Forget it. So please don't
mind all this. Sorry.
[sniffling]
What happened? What did he say?
Did he say he didn't like you?
He said he doesn't like my date of birth.
[shutter closes]
Sir, what should I do
with the leftover idlis?
Give the idlis away to someone.
Has the batter gone sour?
-Yes.
-Throw it in some waste bin.
We are throwing away
so much food everyday.
God knows when will this hotel get better.
[laughs]
Idiot!
-Have you gone mad?
-What should I do then?
We are not even getting back our
maintenance money after all these days.
The count of flies and mosquitoes in here
are more than the number of customers.
Will you cut the tree for that?
Use your brain.
When the business grows,
we can put up some tables
in its shade.
And what about all the things you said
about overcoming anything
to make this a success?
Where did it go?
How can you not have patience?
Did you expect people to throng
to your hotel upon setting it up here?
First, think about how to draw people
to eat here.
I had the same experience in
the initial days of my cell phone's store.
Hey! Don't use that stupid cell phone shop
of yours as an example in every matter.
Idiot! I am saying that for your own good.
Patience is the key for the hotel
to progress. Wait for few more days.
Of course, I will wait.
But my uncle wouldn't.
She said that he's brought
a wedding match for her.
I am scared.
He will get her married
if we don't succeed soon.
I must do something.
Please have some coffee.
She wants to work after marriage.
No problem. That's not an issue.
Let her work until she has a kid.
This is a very good match.
The boy looks good.
He's tall, handsome,
and holds a government job.
Though she's been getting many matches,
this is the best one, sister.
-Yes, he's a government employee as well.
-Father.
Yes.
Father, I want to talk to you
about something.
I don't want to get into this marriage.
Why? They have agreed
to let you work, right?
I don't want to get married now, Father.
Good matches don't come whenever we want.
But, why do you say so?
There should be some reason
for that, right?
I asked you
before arranging all this, right?
-Come on, answer.
-Huh?
[gate creaks]
[sighs]
[advertisement playing on TV]
-Calm down. Listen to me. Don't shout.
-Don't support her.
Don't we know what's good for her
as her parents?
Should we ask for her permission?
Won't you ask for my opinion
before marrying me off?
Why is your voice raising?
-I'll slap the hell out of you!
-Calm down!
Yes, Father. Slap me!
Let's get it over with.
He's speaking for your own good.
You don't need to convince her.
I've had enough, Mother.
How many more days
will he vent out his anger at me?
Doesn't he care for what I want?
Should I do everything as per his wish?
Shut up, or I will beat you senseless.
How dare you!
One plate onion dosa.
Good morning, sir.
I will get your order ready.
Meanwhile, have these "Chitti Garelu".
What is this?
-Bombay chutney, sir.
-Why?
It's really good. It's free.
Free? Why?
It's a new variety, sir.
And our special dish.
Just try it once.
Master, an onion dosa.
Okay.
[sniffs]
What's this? Don't you clean the place?
What is this disgusting smell?
[sniffs]
-Shiva.-Yes, sir.
There is a dead rat.
Dead rat? Master, there is a dead rat
over here. Check it.
A rat? So much food is left over.
Rats are expected to come.
I am looking for it.
[phone ringing]
-Yes, Sandhya. Yes.-"Bava",
I have told my parents everything.
What did you say?
I told him that I would marry you.
What? Why did you say that now?
You were the one
who encouraged me to do that, right?
Oh, man! You have put me
in a tight spot, Sandhya.
I asked you to say no to that match,
but not to confess about us.
I had to tell them someday.
Come and speak to my parents.
How can I come to your house
and ask them
"Uncle, I've sold the land and
I've spent all that money on this hotel
and now it is running in losses."
"Kindly get your daughter married to me."
"I'll make her grind the batter and take
good care of her." Should I say this?
Are you backing off now,
after asking me to stay brave?
That's not the point, Sandhya!
-Please, Raghava...
-Hey! Who are you talking to?
-Give me the phone.
-Father...
[line beeping]
[TV playing]
Hey. Don't do this now.
Your father is very angry
with Nageshwar Rao. Listen to me.
-No, Mother. I'll tell him.
-No...
[laughing]
Father.
Father, here...
Have some water.
[TV playing]
-Father
-Yes.
-I want to tell you something.
-Tell me.
[TV playing]
Will you switch off the TV?
That won't be a problem. Tell me.
No. Switch it off.
Tell me.
Don't get angry.
You know our Nageshwar Rao Uncle, right?
-So?
-You know his daughter Sandhya, right?
We've been in love with each other
for a long time.
If you all agree to it,
we want to get married.
This is the first wise decision
you have ever taken in your life!
-Gopal, get on the bike.
-Yes, uncle.
-Let's get going.
-Father...
Father, where are you going?
Is it Sunday today?
Yes, it's Sunday.
Where are you going?
Father, where are you going?
Why do you ask? I am going
to Nageshwar Rao's house.
Ah! Why? I will come as well.
No need for that.
People will laugh if you come to talk
about your own marriage. Move aside.
What if you make a scene over there?
I have to come.
I know how to talk. You don't need to poke
your nose in adult matters. Move aside.
Father, I have to come.
Okay. But on one condition, that you have
to keep your mouth shut while I speak.
Then get on the bike. Move aside.
Okay.
-Go on.
-Okay, uncle.
-Drive.
-Hey!
-Drive slowly. Don't hurry.
-Okay.
-Gopal, drive safe.
-Sure, aunt.
Did you bring them?
Did you find anything
about the contractor?
-Here, treat yourself.
-He has the support of some big wigs.
I've met with Mallikarjun Rao once.
He is a nice guy.
-Here, have them.
-No. Thank you, aunt.
He used to be around my office
all the time.
Umm... Sorry for what I said in the heat
of the moment the other day.
Please don't mind. It was my mistake.
Hmm. Sometimes things go wayward.
It's alright.
I will get to the point
without beating around the bush.
I'm here to ask your daughter's hand
in marriage with my son.
He said that both of them are in love
with each other.
My daughter didn't even mention
about it at all.
Girls are usually shy
in these matters.
He told me everything.
The thing is that she is getting matches
from big, wealthy families.
Recently, we got
one such match from Vijayawada.
The boy is an AE, an Assistant Engineer
in our R and B department.
I've already said okay to that match.
All that is left is saving the dates.
[scoffs] I shouldn't really say this,
but we've been witnessing
the last minute cancellation of weddings.
Both of them love each other.
We should consider that as well, right?
Brother-in-law,
please think from my perspective.
On one hand, the AE guy,
the government job holder.
On the other hand, there is this guy.
Who would you prefer?
To be frank,
all the boys that you talk about
come for the dowry that you give.
So, you don't want any dowry?
Is it true, brother-in-law?
Yes, uncle. I don't want
a single penny as dowry.
All I want is Sandhya.
Tell your father to say the same thing.
What do you say?
This isn't the time or place
for such topics.
I should not boast about my own son
but he's no less than anyone else.
If his hotel makes a mark,
he will earn 1 lakh rupees per month.
Yeah. We've been observing
how well his hotel is running.
I pass by his hotel on my way
to the office every day.
He got into the hotel business
instead of getting a proper job.
He's just shooing flies over there.
-In a business...
-Brother-in-law...
We have fixed on that match.
Please don't put us in a spot.
But this isn't a decision
for us to make, Nageshwar Rao.
We should consider
our children's consent as well, right?
I think that's not something
you do in your home.
We'll leave.
I blame myself
for bringing you along.
Why did you have to mention dowry?
Unable to hold your horses, idiot!
I brought along an idiot.
What's wrong in what he said?
I told you to shut up, didn't I?
You childish moron!
Who asked you to interfere
and say, "I don't want dowry"?
Do you think I am an idiot
trying to convince him?
That's why I told you not to tag along.
Worthless bums!
What's with this stink?
Shiva! You couldn't even find a dead rat?
Wastrel! I shouldn't have hired you!
That's not the smell of a dead rat, sir.
Come here.
Where are we going?
Come over, sir.
What's there?
I'll show you, sir. Just come.
Look over there.
Where did this dump come from?
This wasn't there before.
Sorry, sir. I was the one who started
dumping here because the place was empty.
Now, the entire colony
has started using it.
I didn't expect that this would become
such a big problem. I am sorry, sir.
To hell with your apologies! Fool!
-Hello! Is this the municipality?-Yes.
There is an open garbage dump
in the third lane of Donka Road.
What the hell are you doing?
Bloody government job workers.
All flash, no substance!
-Won't you check it?
-Will you get it cleaned or not?
Hey! Why are you blabbering?
You should request for our help.
Do you think we are your servants?
Post your complaint
anywhere you like!
Damn!
Who would tolerate
if you vent your anger at them?
Clean it yourself.
What can be done? You opened up a hotel
in Guntur despite my objection.
Let's go, Gopal.
Yuck!
DO NOT LITTER HERE
[shutter opens]
[gate creaks]
Greetings, sir!
I just wanted to talk about fixing
the wedding dates as it's been so long.
Oh, no! What happened, sir?
You agreed on the other day, didn't you?
What happened now?
No, there must be some mistake.
I'll get back to you.
Are you sure? Was he talking
about our land in Santha Magaluru?
They said that the MLA of that place
has bought 50 acres of land over there.
Now, he is shifting the highway plan
towards his land.
There will be
an official notification soon, as well.
-Does it mean that the match is gone now?
-Of course!
They agreed for the marriage
because of the land price,
not for our family.
I think we have gone
a bit far out of greed.
She too loves Raghava.
He is a nice guy too.
Let's fix on Kondal Rao's son.
Kondal Rao will spit on my face.
After all the things I have said,
how can I show my face to him?
With this same face!
You blabbered out of the pride
of having the land.
There is nothing wrong
in accepting a mistake.
[creaks]
My father asked me to come urgently.
I wonder what mess he has made for me now.
He must have brought you a match.
Father...
[people laughing]
I'll soon transfer the land
into my daughter's name, brother-in-law.
After the marriage,
it will be as good as yours.
Forget about the land.
The marriage is more important.
-We'll do just as you said.
-Ah! [laughs]
Oh, you're here! Have a sweet.
No. Thank you, uncle.
I understand the fact that the kids
of this generation wouldn't listen to us.
-Brother-in-law.
-Yes.
Well, what happened to that wealthy
AE match you were talking about?
Let me tell you the truth.
I don't want to get my daughter
married to him.
I was looking forward for that AE match.
My daughter's blind stubbornness
finally convinced me.
-Isn't everything we do for their good?
-Leave me.
You shouldn't do this
if you aren't entirely convinced, uncle.
I was just saying that.
That's not what you just said.
That's what you meant.
Even the other day you said I am nobody
when compared to that AE.
Oh, no! That's not my intention.
Regardless of your intentions,
there is no need to rush for my marriage.
I'll only marry when you have confidence
in me and my hotel.
Let's not talk
about my marriage till then.
He is hell bent on taking revenge on me.
He always says or does the opposite of me.
We must have been sworn enemies
in the previous life.
Calm down.
It was because of him that I went there
and became a fool
by talking to them
about fixing the wedding, right?
Does your brain stop
when you get enraged?
Don't you have any control
on your mouth?
Your wedding would have been fixed
if you had kept quiet for a minute!
After I'd convinced my father
by putting lot of efforts,
how could you break it off so easily?
Your father spoke of me
as if I am a wastrel.
How did you ever think
I would be okay with that?
So what? Would it be the end of the world
if he spoke so?
That's my nature, Sandhya.
I won't bother anyone. And if someone
undermines me, I'll lose my control.
I'm telling you.
I'll lose my control
even if it is your father.
How can you say that? What would you do
if he brings another match for me?
There won't be such a scope.
That won't happen.
What if it happens?
I'll handle it if it goes that far.
What will you handle?
You have no answer to that.
That's why you are skipping that.
What's with your torture!
I'll marry you
only if the hotel flourishes,
otherwise, I won't.
I won't marry you even if
your hotel business becomes successful.
Sandhya.
Sandhya. Wait a minute!
Sandhya...
I'm sorry, Sandhya.
I shouldn't have said that.
You've been seeing my situation, right?
My problems start
from the time I wake up.
On one hand, I am really confused
why this hotel is failing.
On the other hand, this marriage tension
coupled with that garbage mess.
At least, you should understand
and give me some time.
I need some time for my hotel
and chutney to make a mark...
Your chutney isn't that great, bava.
I have eaten it, right?
The chutney in the food cart at the corner
of our lane tastes better than yours.
Your chutney alone is not enough
to make your hotel a success.
Introspect it at the ground level.
Stop building castles in the air.
Hello. Yes.
Come and take everything I have.
Why are you pestering me then?
I told you I'll repay you
once I get the chit fund amount
from Surendra, didn't I?
Yes. Hang up!
Ah! Hey!
Hey, Mallikarjun Rao!
Stop. Oh, Mallikarjun Rao!
Mallikarjun Rao!
[splashes]
[splashes]
Hey!
Did you find him?
-Gopal.
-Yes.
They were saying that your uncle
jumped into the canal.
[panting]
[people clamouring]
Please, move aside. Move. Move.
Careful now. Careful.
Move aside. Move aside.
Slowly. Slowly.
Father... Father... Father...
Father... Get up, Father.
Father... Father...
Father... Father...
[crying]
[sobbing]
Mallikarjun Rao did a terrible thing.
He shouldn't have killed himself.
We would have killed him with our words
if he had come back.
This happened for his own good.
-Stop talking nonsense.
-Gopal,
you said he would become an MLA
and live for 80 years.
But how did he kick the bucket
so soon?
"It is good? Is it bad?
Or is it something in between?"
"Or did I miss to assess the time?"
"Is it a friend? Is it a foe?"
"We never know what will it do to us?"
"Didn't you assess its nature?"
"The time that is leading you
in the thorny path"
Hey, Gouthami, why don't you
get into the auto rickshaw once?
"Won't it show the highway
if we wait patiently?"
"The time is very clever
that throws difficult questions at us"
"Won't it come back
with all the answers?"
Place your finger on your cheek, madam.
Pose with your fingers like this, madam.
"When a smile flowers in the heart"
"Won't it soothe us off the guilt?"
"When the night's darkness
blinds our eyes"
"Won't the light come
and show us the day?"
"The future is not written
in our palm lines"
"One should learn from the mistakes
of the past and forget it"
"Don't look for divine intervention
to help you with your problem"
"All these pains are nothing
but a passing cloud"
"It will not last forever like the sky"
"Courage is the only thing,
that should last"
"Even in the face
of endless sufferings"
Gouthami, I have to talk to you.
Will you please come to the cloth store?
I am talking to you. Will you please
come there? I need to talk to you.
What do I seem to you? Do you think that
I will come wherever you want me to?
"Life is like an ocean"
"One should learn to swim across it"
"There's is nothing wrong in falling down"
-"We must try getting back on feet"
-Sir... Sir, please serve a dosa.
"Regardless of whatever obstacles
that come in your path"
"We should progress"
"As if there is a day
when waves stop flowing"
"Time will take off
our blindfolds one day"
"And will show us the truth?"
"And on that day,
all our illusions will disappear"
"Even after our fall"
Mother, does my chutney
really taste delicious?
What happened all of a sudden?
I don't know, Mother.
In fact, what father said is true.
There are guys like me
in every lane over here.
The chutney at the food cart
tastes better than mine.
It's not even Bombay chutney.
Forget all that.
Be it a Bombay chutney
or some other chutney,
it has to taste delicious
when it touches the tongue.
That's important.
When we put our heart in our work,
we'll know if it tastes good or not.
Focus on your work
rather than seeking fame.
Fame would come on its own
if the work is good.
Don't overthink.
Well... Do you want to visit here?
No, Mother. I don't want to come home
until my hotel succeeds.
His dilemma is all about that hotel.
He became solitary.
Where is he?
He is inside.
BOMBAY CHUTNEY IS FAMOUS HERE
Hey!
It says "famous'.
[sniffles]
Mother, have this.
-Father, come here.
-No, I'm not hungry.
-Stop that. You don't have to work.
-Hey.
-Hey... Hey...
-Eat this first.
He asks me to eat now. Wonder why!
Eat now!
Give that here.
-Have a safe journey, Mother.
-Okay.
Look...
Difficulties will come and go.
We have to keep doing our work honestly.
That's what is important.
What do you say?
Your chutney tastes delicious as well.
Work hard.
Call us if you need anything.
Don't roam around unnecessarily.
Keep eating on time!
RAGHAVA TIFFIN
It is 12 a.m., sir.
This is the time
when police and ghosts roam around.
Let's go home.
Can't we do this tomorrow?
Just shut up and work.
Simply blabbering!
I'll ensure this problem
ends today!
[shutter opens]
[sniffs]
[gate creaks]
[phone rings]
Hello.
Yes... Yes.
Sure. Definitely. Sure.
[phone ringing]
That AE guy called me.
He wants to marry our daughter.
Really?
Yes. They are already on the way
to our home. Be ready.
Okay.
[phone ringing]
Don't rush.
Sandhya likes Raghava, right?
Who is bothered about who she likes?
Didn't we go to Raghava's place to talk
about the wedding the other day?
Wasn't the humiliation enough?
-That's not the point...
-I have fixed on this wedding match.
I am coming home. Let's handle it.
Will you shove off every match
that comes my way in this manner?
You'd give silly excuses
such as horoscope,
caste and lineage didn't match,
the girl's nose and jawline features
are not pleasant, etc.
And if god-forbid everything works out,
you'd whine about dowry not being enough.
-A marriage consists of all those aspects.
-Please don't talk.
To hell with your snobbery!
I like that girl
and will marry only her.
Even her father is okay.
Please shut up while you're there.
We should have started after
the inauspicious time was over.
Sorry, please look ahead. Look ahead.
[phone ringing]
Yes, Mr. Nageshwar Rao.
-We've entered Guntur.
-Talk to him first.
We'll be there within 15 minutes. Okay.
Understand why we are explaining to you.
-One shouldn't rush into these things.
-Yes, dear.
I'm 30 now.
Don't I know the type of girl I want?
Huh! Don't I know the type of girl I want?
I have left that choice to you
as you are elders but...
And you managed to louse it up
with your bloody traditions.
[people clamouring]
Hey, why aren't you picking up the phone?
Do you know how many times
I have tried calling you?
Did they take away your phone again?
I've been trying to tell you
the good news since two days.
Why aren't you saying anything?
What should I say?
There is nothing to talk with you.
I know what you are going to say.
Maybe the news is that your hotel is
finally doing well. That's it, right?
That's exactly what I wanted to say.
How did you guess that?
What would you say other than that?
You just won't change.
[people clamouring]
Why are you so angry with me now? Huh?
What's the price of ridge gourd?
Sixty rupees per kg.
I'll take 2 kg, make it 100..
I'm talking about serious things here
and you are haggling for ridge gourds?
At least this is something useful.
This is better work.
Ms. Gouthami.
Ms. Gouthami, please. I am sorry.
Can I speak to you for two minutes?
-Gopal, what's this? Go away.
-Please. Hey.
Ms. Gouthami, please. Just spare
two minutes. I won't waste your time.
What will you say? Huh!
I'd have understood if you had told me
that you didn't like me or my behaviour.
But you said you didn't like
my date of birth. Is that in my hands?
Isn't that humiliating me?
What I did is wrong. I am an idiot.
It took me this long to understand
that horoscopes are trash.
Well, I've been roaming around you
since a long time, right?
Don't you think
humans are prone to make mistakes?
That is what makes us humans, right?
No, no. I am sorry. I am sorry.
I'll come right to the point.
I love you so much. And if you have
feelings for me, I'll marry you.
I swear on my granny that I'll never think
of those bloody horoscopes again.
I don't have patience
to hear this rambling.
Come and talk with my family
if you have more to say.
I've been begging you for so many days.
Why are so stubborn?
Gopal, look at the note. The note!
Note? What note?
Yeah, she chucked something at me.
Must be the address.
Damn! Where is it?
Gouthami... Gouthami, wait a minute.
Oh, man! How come she left so quickly?
Have the sky inside your house.
Buy one radium sticker for 70 rupees
and three for 200 rupees.
There's a big discount on three pieces.
Come and buy away.
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.
Sir. Sir. Sky in your home.
Will you buy some radium stickers?
Well... Where's Kakumanivari Thota?
Go straight and turn right.
But that is left!
Not left. You have to take a right.
-Is it left or right?
-Damn! Just go straight and turn right.
Damn!
I am the tiger of the house. No one
crosses me in my house or in the town.
I lay down the rules here.
I'll personally preside
your wedding, son-in-law.
And she's here just in time.
Come, dear.
I keep mentioning an auto rickshaw driver,
Kotinagulu, right? This is him.
That's his own auto rickshaw outside.
He was given 10,000 rupees
by the government recently.
He is pure gold.
He doesn't even want dowry.
He will take care of both our needs.
She left because she's shy.
She is coming. She is here. Dear...
-Get up.
-Hey!
Get out of here. Get out!
Why did you do that?
-Now don't get angry. I'll talk to her.
-Damn you!
Son-in-law...
Why did you hit that poor boy?
Son-in-law... Stop, I'm coming.
Bloody shrew! I'll take you to task
when I get back.
Son-in-law... Stop. Oh, my booze supplier!
I'll preside your wedding!
-Bloody oldie! Bugger off!
-Idiot! Let me get in.
-Why did you get in? Get down.
-Hold on... Hold on...
Your daughter is so proud!
How dare she hit me with
a bathroom cleaning broom! Bloody vixen!
Hey! You can chide me and I'll bear it.
But I'll not spare you
if you call her names. She's gold.
You fool! I neither want your daughter
nor her gold. Just give me my money back.
-Money?
-Ah!
-What money?
-How can you say that?
Hey! Didn't I loan you Rs. 20,000?
When did you loan me Rs. 20,000?
When did you do that?
Hey, oldie, don't act smart.
I won't spare you!
Hey! I can't get anyone
to give me free liquor
and you're saying that you
loaned me money. Where's the proof?
Hey, oldie, I'll really kill you
if you don't stop lying.
Kill me? How dare you! Stop the damn
auto rickshaw right now, you idiot!
-I'm on it, you idiot!
-Come on, pull over!
-Wait!
-Stop it. What do you think of my rep?
Just stop! Let's start the fight.
Come on.
How dare you lie about not taking money!
I'll kill you, old fool!
I'd rather die than lie.
[horns blaring]
I'll kill you, oldie!
Kill me? Cross this line if you dare?
I dare you, dimwit!
I'll trample you under my auto rickshaw
for real! It's not funny!
Do it. Come on, do it.
I dare you to do it!
-Hey oldie! Get up. Get off the road.
-No one can take me away!
I've dealt with worse idiots
than you in my life.
-Get up.
-Hey!
What's this nuisance in the middle
of the road? Take your vehicle away!
Move the vehicle.
Come on. Go away. Now. Do it.
Get into the vehicle.
Leave. Leave.
Or he will kick you as well.
-Hey...
-Stop the auto rickshaw.
Hey, the old bastard is acting smart
instead of repaying my money.
Where are you guys?
-Hey... Stop the auto rickshaw.
-Stop the auto rickshaw.
Look, it's urgent.
Drop us at Kakumanu Vari Thota. Please.
-No, I won't come.
-Please understand.
Our car broke down. It's urgent.
-It'll cost you Rs. 1,000.
-What?
A thousand's fine. A thousand's fine.
A thousand's fine.
A thousand's too much.
How can you demand so much?
Make it Rs. 500.
Stop it and get in.
[tyres screech]
He promised me to get his daughter married
to me in return to the money I gave him.
Now, he has insulted me
by calling to his house.
-Go slow.
-Wastrel!
Go slow. It's okay if we're late.
All we need is to reach
the destination safely.
Oh! Slow down!
Whoa! Slow down and drive carefully.
You are riding on the wrong side. If we
get caught, it'll delay us an hour more.
Are you new to Guntur?
Nobody dares to stop me here.
-Look out!
-Hey...
You idiot! You've dented my vehicle!
Why are you kicking my vehicle?
Are you crazy?
Are you blind that you couldn't see
a vehicle coming?
Don't you know you have to drive safe
at the turns?
It is a brand new auto rickshaw.
Why are you blaming me when it is you
who came in the wrong lane? You prick!
-How dare you curse me!
-Of course, I'll curse you!
I will beat you black and blue.
What the hell are you talking!
[tinnitus]
Hey drive, just drive and drop us.
Forget it and drop us.
Sandhya. This is serious.
Everyone has flaws.
Even I have flaws.
Love is accepting
each other's flaws, isn't it?
And it's not like I've not changed.
I am gradually changing.
-How can I change instantly?
-Will you stop?
I've been expecting you to change
your behaviour since college days.
Though other things changed,
your obstinacy is still intact.
Will you come with me for a while.
I've got to talk to you calmly
for a moment.
[phone ringing]
I've got to go home.
What's it?
Raghava, someone has beaten me.
I'm bleeding.
What! Is it? Where are you?
In front of Vignan Mandir gate.
Wait right there. I'm coming.
I'm at the market.
The market? I'm coming.
I'm coming to the Naaz centre.
Come to that place.
Let's take them to task!
Gopal, you said you were bleeding.
Who's the rascal?
He hit me and went that way.
Curse him!
Let's go.
Hey, that's him.
There are so many auto rickshaws here.
Which one?
Look, the one with
the Pawan Kalyan's sticker.
He's the one. Keep going.
Hey... Keep going.
[honking]
Keep going faster.
Hey... Don't forget.
Bring Malli and Soori along with you.
To hell with his shenanigans!
He's not even considering our safety.
Hey!
Son, are we really going for matchmaking
or anywhere else?
-Hey, stop the vehicle!
-Hey! Rascal!
I've lent him money so that
he'd get his daughter married to me.
Son, our car broke down
and this scoundrel did an accident.
Listen to me. Things won't work out
if we start in inauspicious time.
-Stop! Stop, you rascal!
-Hey! Go! Go!
-Stop it. Stop the vehicle, rascal!
-Stop the vehicle, scoundrel!
Stop!
-Was it him who hit you?
-Yes. That's him.
Get down, rascal!
He said that you came in the wrong route
and hit him as well.
Hey, stay there! I didn't drive
in the wrong route, he did.
Don't act smart!
-He's lying.
-Catch him!
-Stay here.
-Hey!
-Stop, you rascal!
-He came to this side.
-Hey! Please don't do that.
-Where are you running away?
We're getting late.
Don't get into a brawl.
What's with you?
Hey! Do you think bringing in a friend
would scare me?
I too have friends. I can get ten guys
with a single phone call.
Is that so? Call them. Call them.
Please don't quarrel. Please.
-Move aside
-Please don't fight.
Rascal, come and face me!
-Come on, show your worth!
-I'll show it for sure.
You were boasting about you.
What happened now?
-Hey! Who the hell are you?
-Ah!
Oh, my God!
Take your hands off me, I am warning you!
-What the hell are you blabbering?
-Stop it, bava!
Will you hit him just for coming
to matchmaking?
What do you mean by matchmaking?
Aren't you
Mr. Nageshwar Rao's daughter,
Sandhya?
Yes.
They are here.
Did they arrive?
[gate creaks]
[clears throat] Uncle, please don't mind
my words I said the other day.
I heard that there are auspicious days
for marriage in the month of December.
Let's meet on an auspicious day
and fix a date.
Hey Gopal, here.
Give this to Uncle Seenu.
-Okay, Mother.
-Okay, mother-in-law
Ride safe.
-See you, uncle.
-Ride safe, son-in-law.
-I'll drop them, uncle.
-See you, father.
-Take good care of son-in-law.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-See you, Father.
-Bye, dear.
[phone chimes]
Bloody misleading messages!
-Mr. Murthy.
-Yes.
Stop reading the newspaper for a while.
I got the same damn message again.
Will the news change
if I stop reading, Kondal Rao?
Come on.
Kondal Rao, there is news about
highway construction at Santha Magaluru.
Is it? Give it here.
-Do you know what happened?
-What does it mean ultimately?
The MLA bought
a piece of land over there.
Hmm...
He has changed the original
highway construction plan.
Hmm...
That news got leaked to media.
When it became a big mess,
they have said there is no change
in the original plan.
They would construct the road as per that.
And that is what the article states.
Does that mean our land rate still
has a good value in the market or not?
Of course, it still has
a good market value.
Don't you have any other topic
other than hanging around that?
Thank God! Consider my bad times
have gone, brother-in-law.
-My daughter has brought us luck.
-Yes.
For a moment, my heart skipped a beat
over that news.
What was your order?
Bondas? There are no bondas left.
Do you want green tea?
Here, keep it inside.
We are pleased with your hospitality.
Well, we are here to ask for your
daughter's hand in marriage with Gopal.
What you are saying is good.
But we aren't from the same caste.
We don't practice
inter-caste marriage in our clan.
Moreover, our family has got
big reputation and honour.
-Reputation?-Why are you pinching me?
I stated the fact, right?
Why are you staring at each other?
Did you guys get my point?
-What? Where are you taking me?
-Let's go!
Are you going to immerse me in water
like the Lord Ganesha's idol?
Bava...
I'll give everyone their money.
Everyone will get their money.
-Where's Anjaiah? Anjaiah...
-Sir.
Anjaiah. Here's the money
I owed you.
Apologies for being late.
Please don't mind.
No problem, sir.
[clamouring]
The contractor was nabbed
by the police recently, right?
Everyone will get their money
once the case gets settled.
I'm assuring you
that I'll give your money.
I'll give the money.
Everyone will get what they're owed.
Thank God!
Okay. I'm assuring
that I'll give your money.
Sir!
Surendra returned my money!
So quick?
He called me to his home
and gave it in front of everyone.
Here, have your money.
-See you.
-Sure. Take care.
-Go and ask them. Let's see.
-Give me two packets.
How much?
-Do you have change for Rs. 2,000?
-Brother,
is there a good hotel nearby?
Brother, don't try here. Go straight
and you'll reach Donka Road.
You'll find a big mango tree
at the end of the third lane.
There is a hotel behind the tree
which is unnoticeable.
"Raghava Tiffin centre" is the name.
Eat over there.
Well, the Bombay chutney tastes delicious
in that hotel. Try that.
Hey, dude! They are indeed talking
about your hotel.
That's obvious! Get on the bike!
-Hey, master.
-Greetings, sir.
Greetings.
I have ordered poori a long back.
Please bring it.
Hey, come here.
Seems like someone is competing
against you.
Let him compete.
There's no one who can make a chutney
that beats the taste of mine.
-Shiva, get me two bondas
-Okay, sir.
NEW RAGHAVA TIFFIN CENTRE
Hey! Who the hell is that?
-Copycat, rascals!
-Who the hell stole the name of our hotel?
Copycat, rascals! I dare you to come out!
Hey!
