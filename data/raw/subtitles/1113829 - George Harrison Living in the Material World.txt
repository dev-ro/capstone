(Birds chirping)
You know,
just go ahead, George, go on and...
And fly away babe.
Just be free and...And go.
And we 'll... We 'II see you down the line.
Um, just leave.
Go to someplace nice.
We Te gonna be all right here.
And then...
And he went on out That was it
(Man) Is there anything you'd say to George
if he was around today?
(Laughs)
Fancy a cup of tea?
Where've you been?
I had a dream that I saw him,
and that was where...
That was what I said to him in the dream
so I guess that's what would be
the question, wouldn't it?
Where've you been...
since I last saw you?
And he answered it,
so I can tell you
the answer as well, which is,
"Here the whole time."
Which doesn't really help me
in any way, but, you know...
There's George with cancer,
and he knows his life is limited.
And what he does is buys a...
a house in Switzerland
so he can avoid paying the taxman here.
(Chuckles) The man who
wrote the song Taxman,
even to his final hours,
was determined to cheat the taxman
And then I thought, "There's George."
Grace and...and humor.
And a weird kind of angry bitterness
about certain things in life.
(Chuckles)
it's still difficult to try and talk
about him in a kind of...
anecdotal frivolous way. lt's...
it's still too painful.
(Exhales)
(J' George Harrison:
All Things Must Pass)

It's not always gonna be this grey

Red, white and blue rosettes.
Red, white and blue hats.

That in accordance with arrangements
between the three great powers...

Oh, what a happy land
Hi! J'
(J' George Harrison:
All Things Must Pass)
All things must pass
.P All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
OK. Do you want me to start?
(Woman) OK, and then Pete can go.
Right. We lived in 12 Arnold Grove.
It was a two up and two down.
The only heating was a coal fire,
so there was no electricity.
Small backyard.
Toilet down the bottom of the yard.
It was a very cold place.
(Man) What kind of kid was George?
He was cocky.
A cocky little guy.
He...He had a good sense of himself.
You know, he wasn't cowed by anything.
He had a great haircut.
He had this long hair
that he quiff ed back.
We had a...had a friend, Arthur.
And he used to describe it as
(Scouse) "a fucking turban.
"Like a fucking turban.'
And it did.
It looked like a great big...
Was... Marvelous thing.
Looking back now, you know,
it was pre-fame.
So you were just an ordinary kid
who couldn't get in places
cos you weren't famous.
Teachers didn't like you.
You know, rock and roll
hadn't arrived yet.
I always think of it
as kind of Dickensian
And the school that I went to
with George, incidentally, was...
was a very Dickensian old place.
In fact, Dickens had taught there.
That's how Dickensian it was.
You grew up kind of
wanting to go somewhere else.
It made you hungry.
So art was a great golden vision.
You know, so for us that...
We wouldn't have called it art then.
It'd be rock and roll.
(J' The Beatles: Raunchy)
We needed a good guitar player.
Both John and I
played a bit of guitar,
but we couldn't really solo.
We weren't that good.
And I said, "I know this guy.
"He's a bit young, but he's good."
John said, "Well, you know,
let's meet him, come on."
So I said to George,
"You wanna go meet these guys
"I'm in a group with, you know?"
He said "Yeah"
So he brought his guitar,
and we were all on the top deck
of a double-decker bus in Liverpool,
round where John lived,
a place called Woolton_
And nobody was on the bus,
late at night and, uh...
John said, "Well, go on then.
Let's see you play." To George.
I said, "Go on, go on,
get your guitar out."
So George unpacked his guitar,
got it out,
and he played the thing
called Raunchy, which is...
(J' The Beatles: Raunchy)
George, only a brief
document or two left.
For the record, I'd just like to say
these are more papers that I don't know
what they say that I'm signing.
- (Man) Any of these?
- Yes, all those.
John Winston Ono Lennon.
No, no. No, no, no.
Richard Starkey,
or John Lennon, or George Harrison.
Krishna, Krishna, Krishna.
May the Lord
help this to become final.
(Man) The small gathering
on Savile Row
is only the beginning.
The event is so momentous
that historians may one day view it
as a landmark in the decline
of the British Empire.
The Beatles are breaking up.
(J' George Harrison: The Light
That Has Lighted The World)
It's funny how people
Just won't accept change
As if nature itself
They prefer rearranged
(George) When I was still at school
and I was really small
I know John was really embarrassed
cos I was so tiny
I only looked about ten years old.
When I met John,
he had four strings on this guitar.
I mean, John didn't even know
guitars had six strings.
And I said, "What are you doing?
What's that?"
And he was saying,
you know, "What'?"
You know, he thought that's what it was.
So we showed John the guitar chords.
E and A and all those.
My mother was a real big fan of music,
and she was really happy about
having the...the guys around.
You know, and John was always keen
to get out of his house because of, um...
His Aunt Mimi was
kind of very stern and strict and...
she embarrassed him.
I remember going to John's house once
when I first had met him.
I was still at the Institute.
And we were trying to
look like Teddy Boys,
which was like,
that style in those days.
And I must've looked pretty good,
cos she was like...
She didn't like me at all.
She was really shocked.
She said, "Look at him!"
You know, "Who is this?
"Bringing this boy around to this house.
"Look at him.
He looks dreadful, like a Teddy Boy."
And he'd just say,
"Shut up, Mary, shut up!"
(J' George Harrison: Wildcat)
Don't you try
To tame a Wildcat
You just don't understand
Wildcat's what they name me
Don't let no kitten tame me, oh no
J" Not me .P
(Harry Harrison) Our wedding
was just one of those occasions
where they thought they would practice
on people and see what happened.
They were not exactly...
what the majority of people there expected.
They had a tea break,
an elderly lady who was
one of the guests came along
to play the piano,
who was a real pub player.
She could really hammer out tunes
that everybody wanted to sing to.
The three lads reappeared
from the bar, pints in hand,
and John just poured a pint
over this lady's head.
Just straight over the head, saying,
"I anoint thee, David."
And just walked away.
And this lady surprised me because...
there was absolutely nothing.
There was no reaction.
She just smiled
and got up and went away
and got dry again, you know.
It was just...
And I thought it was funny
because like in those days,
people used to say,
"Oh, yeah, so you had
a wedding in Liverpool.
"How many fights were there?"
But, like, there wasn't even a fight.
You know, the nearly fight was
John Lennon pouring a pint
on her head,
(George) When I met John,
he had a lot of power, really.
Sometimes, you know,
they'd pick somebody to march behind
on the way to war.
Well, he was certainly out front
(Jools Holland) When you thought
you wanted to be a musician,
where did you think you'd end up?
(George) There's no justification for it.
We kinda had a feeling that
that's what we were gonna do,
and that, you know, we just felt that
something good was gonna happen.
But, then, in those days,
something good would just be,
you Know, getting to do
a tour of Mecca ballrooms
- Yeah.
- That was like a big deal.
(J' The Beatles: Nothing Shaking
But the Leaves on the Trees)
She's got a way
that makes me act like a fool
Spends my money
then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for her kisses
on my bended knee
Won't you give me some loving, baby?
Please, please, please
(J' George Harrison: Beware of Darkness)
Watch out now, take care
Beware of falling swingers
Dropping all around you
The pain that often mingles
(Klaus Voormann) After wartime,
you still had lots of bombed houses.
Not poverty.
I mean, the Germans were rich
quite quick, you know.
It didn't take them long
to pick up on that one.
That particular day,
I had an argument with Astrid.
I was really angry,
and I wanted to let steam off.
And I quite often went
that direction to the harbor.
(J' The Beatles: Shimmy Shake)
(Glass shattering)
The Reeperbahn is really
for the sailors,
for the people getting drunk,
for people going to see naked women,
or having sex, or whatever.
That's what this place is known for.
(J' The Beatles: Shimmy Shake)
Klaus was always very laid back.
You know, you couldn't quite
impress him by things.
He always said,
"Yeah, great. Fantastic."
But, when he came home
seeing the Beatles for the first time,
I've never seen him like that before.
He just went crazy.
When I came down
to the Kaiserkeller with Klaus,
then, after he had to
persuade me for three days,
I just freaked out.
Seeing them onstage,
faces I always dreamt of
taking pictures of.
Because they had so much personality
and were still young, like I...I was.
(J' The Beatles: Roll Over Beethoven)
I 'm gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today
(George) We didn't really have
that much money.
We only just really had enough
to feed ourselves.
So there was nothing really
to show for it.
But everything else was such a buzz.
You know, being right in the middle
of the naughtiest city in the world.
At 17 years old,
it was kind of exciting.
And learning, you know, about,
well, there's all the gangsters
and there's the transvestites
And there's the... You know,
it was like that. There's the hookers...
(Klaus) They looked real strange,
Teddy Boy-like.
They didn't have the leather gear yet.
The leather thing came
when they met Astrid and me
and the way we were walking around.
(J' The Beatles: Roll Over Beethoven)
We loved this band.
We were knocked out.
And we didn't realise how they lived.
The Bambi Kino was a porno cinema.
The room they stayed in first
was a sort of place
where you'd normally
put brooms and things.
There was no window,
there was just a light bulb
on the ceiling.
And they were sort of living
in these little cupboards, so to speak,
right behind the screen of that cinema.
And it was terrible,
because they were smelly, stinky.
They couldn't wash
their clothes properly.
(Astrid) Klaus introduced me to them
and John did his, you know,
"I'm a man, I'm a man" thing.
And Paul was doing his,
"I'm a good boy, good education" bit,
you know.
Said hello and gave... Shook my hand.
And George was just...
Looked at me and said,
"Oh, hello.
And you are Klaus's girlfriend?"
But he was ever so sweet.
I came to know George then.
And he was interested in so many things,
but, let's say on the quiet,
because Paul was the one who said,
"Oh, who is that?"
and, "Who wrote this book?"
and, "Who is that on that picture?"
George was just sitting there
looking at my room,
which must have been
very strange to them,
because it was completely black
with leaves and branches
hanging from the ceiling.
I think at first George thought
I was a bit mad.
But that became,
very shortly, a very lovely
and nice friendship.
Astrid took them to her house.
And she cooked for them.
Astrid's mother was cooking
their favourite meals for them.
So they had their little home
suddenly, which ....
Astrid really took care of them really well.
(George) Yeah, it was really good
for us to meet them too.
They in themselves, were very artistic.
I mean, for us, we started
hanging out with them
and Astrid was so loving.
She really helped us a lot
(Astrid) You may think it was sexually.
Of course, in a way,
they all fancied me,
because I was quite
good-looking and charming
in my own little way,
with my funny English.
When I started
falling in love with Stuart,
it was great that I was a photographer,
so I could just go up easily to him
and ask him,
"Do you mind if I take pictures of you?"
Because I felt so attracted to him.
(J' Paul McCartney A Taste of Honey)
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo
I dream of your first kiss
And then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
Taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
(Astrid) I always had a vision
that I want to take pictures
of outstanding faces,
who can tell a story behind the mask.
Imagine what is behind this
rough young man John Lennon.
And what is behind
the funny, joking Paul.
Or the lovely, sweet little George.
(Klaus) George was only
17 years of age.
But he was calm.
He looked you straight in the face.
He was funny.
And he was a catalyst in the band.
You see, Paul and John
were so different.
And George was bringing
a certain peace into this setup.
I mean,
Ringo wasn't with them at the time,
because Pete Best was playing the drums.
And Stuart was more on the side.
But George was right in the middle
between those two characters.
After Stuarts death,
John and George really cared about me.
You know, they used to
come and see me in my home.
And so it was actually
John's suggestion.
John said, "Can I see
where he used to paint?"
So I said, "Of course you can."
In that moment,
I had to take a picture of them
And I just grabbed this old chair
and put it there.
And John was so full of emotion
being in the same room
where his friend was just painting,
that he nearly burst out in tears.
And George was a bit worried.
So I just said to George,
"Well, stand behind him."
You could see how quickly
George understood what it was all about.
Death and being alive.
He was only just turned 18.
And when you look at the picture
and see his eyes,
they're so full of protection for John.
And John was just
falling to bits sitting there.
And you could see that in his face.
(J' The Beatles: This Boy)
(George) Aw!
I gave that guitar away.
Ah, that's the one.
That boy
Took my love away
He'll regret it some day
- Doo da doo
- This boy
Wants you back again
(Laughing)
That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
Good song, though. Not a bad song.
This boy wants you back again
(George) John was as blind as a bat
and he'd never wear his glasses,
so he couldn't see a thing.
Oh, and this boy
would be happy
Just to love you
Double track.
J' Oh my-y-y-y-y
J” That boy won? be happy
Till he's seen you
Cry-y-y-y
(Screaming)
(George) It was almost like
we were waiting to get going.
And we couldn't go until
all the Beatles were in the frame.
Ringo was the member of the band.
It's just that he didn't enter the film
until that particular scene, you know?
We were always kinda,
you know, a little nervous before
each step we went up the ladder.
And that was a good thing
about being four together.
We all shared the experience.
How many Beatles does it take
to change a light bulb?
(Laughs)
Four
(J' The Beatles:
I Saw Her Standing There)
Well, she was just 17
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
How could I dance with another?
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Well, you know, we just went in,
we were punks, really.
You know what I mean?
We were like just these punks.
We went in, we're all
incredibly grateful to be on vinyl.
You know,
the idea of getting a record.
And then, when it was
going up the charts in England,
we'd stop the car
cos you'd know when it was coming on.
BBC at 4219.
"Stop the car!"
And then we'd listen to the record.
And then drive on up to the gig.
(J' The Beatles: I Saw Her
Standing There)
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there
Whoa!
(Girls screaming)
Does the continuous
living and working together
impose any temperamental
stress upon you?
No, actually, it's quite...
It's quite lucky cos we've been...
We've been together now
(All) For 40 years
You know, we've all been mates
for quite a long time,
so we don't get on each other's nerves
as much as we could.
I think I saw you being greeted
by somebody outside.
- No, no, that was George.
- That was me. That was me.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
Well, actually, it was, um, my mother.
(Laughter)
Your mother has to come
to Ireland to see you?
Yeah. (Laughs)
(J' The Beatles: I Saw Her
Standing There)
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
(Man) Do you find any difficulty
in Keeping up your public image, just...
- No.
- What image?
Our image is just us.
You know, as we were.
We didn't try and make an image.
It just happened.
And so we don't have to keep it up.
We just remain ourselves.
Don't we, Ringo?
- Well, I... We do. We do.
- Don't know about those other two.
I mean, it's the other two
we're worried about
(Ringo) The general atmosphere,
we all loved it.
We all dug it, but, you know,
still in the band, we all had
personalities and attitudes.
We stopped at a motorway café,
you know.
Eat some grease.
No, Paul had the keys,
and George was sitting' behind the wheel,
as we came up.
And so, an argument went on
for at least an hour and a half.
"I've got the keys."
"Well, I'm sitting' behind the wheel."
And it was like, we had to sit there
and go through this
cos one of...
No one was gonna give up.
You know, "I got the keys."
"I've got the wheel."
(J' The Beatles: You Can't Do That)
So, please listen to me
if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings
I go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down
Let you down
And leave you flat
Gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Ahh!
You can't do that
(Dhani reads)
"Dear Mum and Dad,
"the shows have been going great
with everybody going potty
"And everywhere we go, we have about
20 police on motorbikes escorting us.
"We have had two Cadillacs every place.
"But tonight
when we finished the show and ran out
"the cars weren't there
and had gone to another door
"So we went back inside
until we could get out
"All the kids came out of the show
and saw the two cars around the side
"and stormed them
and jumped all over them.
"And the drivers had to get out
and both cars were completely wrecked.
"And the roofs were right down
on the seats inside.
"Some girl fell through
a skylight from the roof of a building,
"and 45 more were put in hospital.
"In the end, we escaped in an ambulance.
"But don't worry
because no one can get near us
"for all the police and security "
I got something to say
That might cause you pain
If I catch you talking
to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
(Man) What actors would you
like to meet in Hollywood?
(Paul) Paul Newman.
(Man) What actresses?
(George) Jayne Mansfield.
(Ringo) We were all in our early 20s,
so we were just going with it.
The good side of it was that
you could really go shopping.
(Laughs)
You know, there's the great line
that the Beatles were...
They had one day off a month
and on the day off
Paul would judge a beauty pageant.
Everybody's green
Cos I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So, please listen to me
if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings
I go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down
Let you down
And leave you flat
Gonna let you down
and leave you flat
You know,
the Beatles only ever had one car,
and two rooms in any hotel between 'em.
We got closer together.
The bigger it got, the closer we became.
Because from the minute you sort of
left the security of your apartment,
the heat was on.
People wanted a piece, wanted to talk,
wanted a photo, wanted to do.
And so we sort of, you know,
kept each other company.
(Screaming)
- Paul!
- George!
(Ringo) When we first came to New York
is a great story because
we had the whole floor in the Plaza
and the four of us
ended up in the bathroom.
We were just sitting in there, like,
"Hey, how you doin'? What's goin' on?"
Just to get a break from,
you know, the incredible pressure.
(Screaming)
(J' The Beatles: Money)
Money don't get everything it's true
What it don't get I can't use
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
(John) The next song
we'd like to sing...
- (Fans screaming)
- (Girl) John!
Shut up. I'll kill you.
...is our latest record.
(Screaming)
Nah-ya-ho!
Or our latest electronic noise
depending on whose side you're on.
That's what I want
That's what I wa-a-a-a-ant
 That's what I want
That's all I want
(Man) Are you individually millionaires yet?
(John) No, that's another
lousy rumor, I wish we were.
- (Laughter)
- All right, then. Where does all the money go?
Well, a lot of it goes to Her Majesty.
(Man laughs)
She's a millionaire.
(Screaming)
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
(Girl) I love the Beatles!
(Dhani reads)
"This morning we Te off to Wellington.
”We've been and played here in Sydney
and it was the biggest drag of all time.
"The stage revolves every three minutes,
"and we have to walk
right down the aisles like boxers
"to get to the stage.
"At the first house,
I punched a policeman
"because he was shoving me like mad.
"And some kids
had a hold of me all at once
"and I was trying to get off the stage.
"I was swearing my head off
at one policeman. Sorry
"And later, the chief came
and apologized to me.
"After the show, there was a party
in the hotel for Paul's birthday "
it's great at the beginning.
You know, where, you know,
you're recognised,
you get a great seat in a restaurant,
and, you know, things are bigger
and things come to you faster.
Um, you know, all that is great.
And then, you really want that to end.
- (Screaming)
- (Paul) Thank you very much, ta. Erm...
This...This number...
(Laughs) Shush! Shush!
This number we'd like to sing now...
(Ringo) You fight for it,
and then when you get it,
you want it to end, but it never ends.
That's...That's the deal.
We do like the fans, and enjoy
reading the publicity about us.
But, from time to time,
you don't realise
that it's actually about yourself.
You see your pictures
and read articles about, you know,
George Harrison, Ringo Starr,
Paul and John,
but you don't actually think,
"Oh, that's me.
There I am in the paper."
lt's...lt's funny. It just as though
it's a different person.
(J' The Beatles: Roll Over Beethoven)
I'm gonna write a little letter

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox's blown a fuse
(Woman) Do you know
where you were this time last week?
No. Haven't a clue.

what day it is.
You don't know what day it is?
What is it?

”We've been to the Hollywood Bowl
"and done the show, which was great
"And the place was marvellous
"The seats go right up
the side of big hills.
"Colonel Tom Parker,
Elvis's manager, came to see us,
"and gave us all real leather belts
and holster sets.
"Cowboy things. And little covered
wagons which are television lamps.
"He was good, too
and said that Elvis wants to meet us,
"and has invited us to his house
in Memphis, Tennessee.
"Tonight we were invited
to Burt Lancaster's house
"and he made us very welcome.
"His house was a knockout
and cost him a million dollars.
"I had a swim in his pool,
which was great
"and as hot as a bath almost
"After that
the men from General Artists
"who were organizing the tour
"wanted us to go to this piece
called Whiskey A Go-Go on Sunset Strip.
"And they said it would be great
and we wouldn't be bothered.
"We got there and went in
and fought our way
"with Mal and a few big hard men
to a table where John and Derek were.
"And Jayne Mansfield.
"By this time,
after fighting through the crowd,
"I was annoyed
and I threw some Coke on a cameraman.
"We all fought our way back out
and jumped in the car and went home.
"It was a drag. And we were there
for about ten minutes altogether
"You see why we don't usually
bother going out now. "
(Man) How did George deal with it?
Well, George, you know, George had
two incredible separate personalities.
He had the love, bag of beads personality
and the bag of anger.
He was very black and white.
...Whether you will go along
with any change in taste?
Uh, no.
Well, you never know because we have...
- Well, we change anyway, don't we?
- Yeah.
We hope you've enjoyed the snow tonight.
Have you enjoyed it?

There's a fog upon LA
And my friends have lost their way
We 'II be over soon they said
Now they've lost themselves instead
J” Please don? be long J"
I was boss of Parlophone Records
and I'd made it my business
over the previous years
to develop Parlophone as a comedy label.
And in fact, when Brian Epstein
desperately took us on,
or hoped we would take him on,
he felt he'd hit rock bottom,
cos he'd been everywhere else
and now he was ending up
on a comedy label.
I first met the Beatles in 1962.
I wasn't terribly impressed
with the first stuff they did.
I couldn't make out the sound.
You know, it was something
I hadn't heard before.
So I looked at these four guys,
and thought,
"Well, none of them shines
as being above all the others."
And I had to make up my mind,
in my silly mind,
who the lead singer was gonna be.
Suddenly I realised I would take them
as they were, as a group.
The hell with a lead singer.
They would be singing together.
So we were struggling
with the sound a bit.
And I said to the boys
after we'd done a few takes
of rather nondescript songs,
I said, "Come into the control room
and have a listen
"and see what we've been doing.
"And if there's anything
you don't like, tell us."
And George was the one
who took the leap.
And he said,
"Well, I don't like your tie for a start."
And the others were horrified.
They thought, "God, he's blown it."
But of course, I fell around laughing.
I thought it was...
It was so cheeky, and so funny that I...
You know, he endeared himself to me
on that point.
(J' The Beatles: And I Love Her)
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her'
John and I would write the songs
the week before the studio.
Brian would ring us up...
Brian Epstein, and say,
"You're in the studio next week.
You've got a week off."
We'd go, “Yes!"
He'd say, "But you've got to
write the album."
We'd go, “Yes!"
So we'd just, you know,
each day we'd write a song
so we can have seven or so songs
to go in with,
which was, you know,
enough to...to start with.
And we'd go in the studio,
10:00 in the morning,
and this was the first time George
and Ringo had heard any of the songs.
So this is how good they were.
John and I would go,
"It goes like this."
You know,
 She loves you, yeah...
Or whatever it was.
And they'd go, "Mm-hm."
George would cop the chords.
He'd go, "Uh-huh, uh-huh",
not writing 'em down,
it was just like, "Yeah, go on,
"cos, you know,
I can see what you're doing.
"Cos I'm one of you.
"You know, I didn't write it,
but I see what you did."
Ringo would just stand around with his sticks...
(imitates rhythm) and do his little thing.
(J' The Beatles: And I Love Her)
And I was just thinking actually
about my song And I Love Her.
J” I give her all my love J”
I had that,
but then George comes in with...
(Hums riff from And I Love Her)
Now you think about that.
That's the song.
You know, but he made that up
on the session.
Cos he knew the chords,
and he just said,
"Well, you know", we said,
"it needs a riff."
I didn't write that.
When we got together in the studio,
whoever had written the song,
would be the kind of boss,
in leading the other guys through it.
Paul and John, being the songwriters.
And at that stage, George wasn't
showing himself to be a songwriter.
They were the dominant forces.
George and Ringo were
slightly behind Paul and John
because Paul and John were
the writers and the lead singers.
I guess George was
a kind of a loner, really,
and because he was outside the team
that were providing the hits.
John and Paul had each other
to play against.
And their collaboration
was much more of a competition
than a collaboration, really.
One would do something,
and the other one would say,
"Gosh, I think I can do better than that."
And try and make something better.
George was the sole guy.
He had no one to work with.
(George strums electric guitar and scats)
(George) The funny position I was in
was that in many ways,
you know, this whole focus of attention
was on the Beatles.
So in that respect I was part of it
But from being in them
an attitude came oven
which was John and Paul.
"OK you know, we Te the grooves
and you two, you know, just watch it "
I mean, don't forget I spent ten years
in the back of the limousine with them.
- (George strums)
- About that speed.
(Man) Don't Bother Me.
This is remake recording, take 10.
(George) Don't Bother Me
was the first song again.
It was written basically as an exercise
to see if I could write a song
cos I thought
"Well, if John and Paul can write,
- "everybody must be able to. "
- (Man laughs)
(Harrison) One, two, three, four
(J' The Beatles: Don't Bother Me)
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
- (George) It's just going too fast
- (Music stops)
- (Clapper) Take 12.
- (George) One, two...
(George) I wrote that
in the hotel in Bournemouth.
We were doing the summer season,
and I was sick in bed.
Maybe that's why it turned out
Don? Bother Me.
(Man) Yeah.
(George) But it's not
a particularly good song,
but it at least showed me that
you know, all I needed to do
was keep on writing
and maybe some day I'd...
write something good.
Which I still feel, right at this point
I still keep thinking
I wish I could write something good.
Since she's been gone
I don't want no one to talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe
that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right
when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I 'II never be the same
J” if! don? get her back again
Because I know she 'II always be
The only girl for me
When I saw George and Pattie together,
the way they fit into the Beatles thing,
of all of their domesticity
seemed to be like Camelot, you know.
It was like, uh...
And I was the Lancelot in a way.
I was kind of this lone wolf
without really any, uh...
direction.
(J' The Yardbirds)
I saw the Beatles play
at the Hammersmith Odeon
when I was bottom of the bill
in the Yardbirds
This band was like...
They were like a single person.
It was an odd phenomena, in fact,
that they seemed to move together
and think together.
It was almost like a little family unit.
I was very, very suspicious
about what they were up to.
But when I saw them play, I mean,
I was overwhelmed by their gift,
You know, each one of them seemed to be,
very well endowed
with their own musical capacity.
But the sad part was that no one
listened to 'em. (Chuckles)
And that their audience,
which they had cultivated, I suppose,
they were, you know, 12-year-old girls.
He was clearly an innovator.
George, to me,
was taking certain elements
of R&B and rock and rockabilly
and creating something unique.
They were very generous to everybody.
I mean, they took time
to come and talk to everybody,
I didn't feel threatened at all
because I had
quite a lot of self-confidence
going in my concept of myself as being,
you know, this sort of
blues missionary, as it were.
And...And I...
You know, I wasn't looking
for any favors from anybody.
And George recognised me as an equal
because I had a level of proficiency
even then that he saw
as being fairly unique too, you know.
George chose to move
into a house in Esher.
Now, Esher is maybe eight miles
north of where I was born.
We became friends
and I would go and visit them there.
And something grew out of the music
and the kind of people we were.
I think we shared a lot of tastes too.
In other...you know,
superficial things, cars or clothes, but...
And women, obviously. But, um...
I think what George
might have liked about me
was the fact that I was
a kind of free agent.
And I think, if anything, he may have
already been wondering about whether
he was in the right place
being in a group, you know,
cos the group...the group politic
is a...is a tricky one.
You know, there was a lot about
what he had going which I envied,
and there was a lot about
what I had going that he envied.
(Man) What did he have going
that you envied?
Well, I suppose, money, status.
You know, the classic things.
The Beatles. Man, come on.
(Laughing)
In the beginning, in the early days,
what was good about
being George's friend
was that it was kind of like basking in
the sunshine of this immense creativity.
We'd like to carry on with a song
which is off our last LP.
The LP's called Rubber Soul
and the song, which is sung
by our guitarist George
is called If I Needed Someone,
(J' The Beatles: If I Needed Someone)
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
I guess I'd be with you, my friend
If I needed someone
This is largely an appeal to the,
the feminine heart.
The heart of a young girl
who worships love
and the goddess of love
and the heroes of love.
And this plays
the dominant part in her life.
So the vast majority of the fans
are girls who come there to worship
at the shrine of the goddess
or the young god hero
as they did in the ancient past.
I've seen this
with the most dramatic intensity
with the Beatles playing to two or three
thousand young girls in Manchester.
Apart from another journalist,
I was the only male in the audience.
And I've never experienced
anything like it myself.
If I were confronted
with 10,000 Loch Ness monsters
I wouldn't be so impressed
by this whistling and wailing
and possession
of the soul of these young girls.
(Man) Would you say it's true
that the devotion your group attracts
is essentially religious in nature?
(Lennon) No.
In what way is it not?
Well, in what ways do you think it is?
The fervor, the excitement that it...
Well, would you say the football crowds
are any more religious,
or football fanatics
have any more religion in them
than the Beatle fanatics?
I don't think so.
(Newsreader) One value
divides the generations
more sharply than any other Religion.
The gap is greatest between
college students and their parents.
The question was whether belonging
to some organized religion
is important in a person's life.
9 out of 10 parents say it is.
Only 4 out of 10 college students
say religion is important
And the more radical
the youth politically
the more likely he is to reject
the religious values of adult society
Still, the gap is there
whatever the politics.
(Man) Well, some of the remarks
attributed to you
in some of the newspapers,
the press here,
concerning the remark that you made
comparing the relative popularity
of the Beatles with Jesus Christ
and that the Beatles were more popular.
This created quite a controversy
and a furore in this country.
Would you clarify the remark?
I've clarified it about eight 800 times,
you know.
I could've said TV
or something else, you know.
And that's as clear as it can be.
There were other evidences that
that ol' time religion was under attack.
Evangelist Billy Graham went to London
hoping he could stop
England from swinging.
In the process, he was almost engulfed
by sin on a Soho street
I think a great deal of what we see
among young people today
is actually a spiritual search.
These young people are searching
for a creed to believe in,
a song to sing and a cause to follow.
(.L" The Beatles: If I Needed Someone)
.P Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
J' Ahh

Before we sort of “made it",
as they say,
money was partly the goal,
but it still wasn't, "Let's get some money."
But we sort of got... Suddenly had money,
and then it wasn't all that good.
By having the money we found
that money wasn't the answer
because we had lots of material things
that people, sort of,
spend their whole life to try and get.
And we managed to get them
at quite an early age.
And it was good really,
because we learn that that wasn't it.
We still lacked something.
And that "something" is the thing
that religion is trying
to give to people.
(Interviewer) Have they changed
because of all this?
Altered, developed, perhaps,
but not..
Not changed too much.
They're not in anyway
contaminated by it.
Not nearly as seriously contaminated
as many of the people
who occasionally surround us.
They remain very calm
and bland and simple.
And they don't know what it's all about.
They simply want to play their music
and write it.
They're...They're very normal.
Thank goodness.
I came home one day
with the kids and Derek said,
"Brian's just phoned." Brian Epstein.
"And he's having
a housewarming in Sussex,
"and he wants us to go.
He wants all his friends to be there."
So we rallied
all our babysitters together,
and we found ourselves on a plane.
And we arrived at Heathrow,
and waiting for us was John,
and George.
And they were dressed
in this exotic way.
They had silk shirts,
and they were this incredible color.
And they hugged us
and they kissed us and they...
All of a sudden it's like there are
no barriers, no handshakes lt's...
And what's happening?
And we were swept out to this...
To outside Heathrow Airport
where John's Rolls-Royce,
like a Romany caravan,
was waiting for us.
George, in his Mini
and us in the Rolls-Royce
with Procol Harum playing
Whiter Shade of Pale,
driving along the English country roads
from Surrey to Sussex.
And Brian was waiting for us.
And there were all sorts of his friends,
famous and not so famous.
And George gave Derek acid
and John gave me acid.
And then John gave Derek acid.
So Derek had a double dose.
And we spent the whole night with them,
on this mind adventure
which Paul had described to us
as "controlled weirdness."
(Laughs) I'm not quite sure
how controlled it was, but it was weird.
But it was wonderful, and it bonded us,
because they were so kind to us.
And we came through it and we walked out
into this English country garden
with the night receding
and the sun coming.
Sitting in an English garden
waiting for the sun, well...
That...That was what happened,
literally what happened.
When we took
the notorious wonder drug LSD...
(Man) Yes.
...It was... We didn't know
we were having it.
John and I had the...
had this drug and it was given...
We were at...
Having dinner with our dentist.
(Audience laughs)
And he put it in our coffee
and never told us.
And we'd never...
We never heard of it.
I mean,
it's a good job we hadn't heard of it,
because there’s been so much paranoia
created around the drug
that people now if they take it they're
already on a bad trip before they start.
Whereas for us we didn't know anything.
We were so naive.
And so we had it
and we went out to a club
and it was incredible.
It was really incredible.
Something like
a very concentrated version
of the best feeling
I'd ever had in my life.
It was just, like, fantastic.
I just felt like in love.
But not with anything in particular,
or anybody, just with everything.
Just everything was perfect.
And we walked and things weren't
the same that night as they'd been.
It was... All this Alice in Wonderland
stuff was going on.
But strange things.
I remember Pattie was,
you know, half playfully,
but half kind of like crazy,
was trying to smash a shop window.
And I was kind of being like,
you know, "Come on now, don't be silly.
You know. "This way." (Chuckles)
And we got around this corner and...
It was all these lights and taxis.
It looked like there was
a big film premiere going on.
It was probably just
the doorway to the nightclub.
It seemed like, you know, very bright.
And all these people with make-up
that was like this thick on their faces.
You know, like masks.
I had this lingering thought
that just stayed with me after that.
And this thought was
Yogis of the Himalayas.
I don't know why. It just ...
I never thought about them
for the rest of my life.
But suddenly this thought was
in the back of my consciousness.
It was like somebody
was whispering to me, you know.
The Yogis of the Himalayas.

Interview de Monsieur George Harrison
et Ravi Shankar par Michel Vial.
(Laughs)
Sound is God.
And through sound,
or that is through good music,
there can be also music
which can be devil.
- I don't want to name which music.
- (George laughs)
But... (Laughs) ...music can excite you
and make you...go mad.
People go, you know, crazy.
That is also music.
But it didn't... Doesn't lead you,
spiritually towards God.
But music has this power.
Whether it is through
the Gregorian chants
or beautiful Baroque music,
or Indian music, or even folk songs,
beautifully sung by people
with beautiful voices.
Our music has been handed down
from person to person.
It's an oral tradition.
It's not a written down music.
And the guru passes
not just a technique,
but the whole spiritual aspect.
All the meaning of life, philosophy,
everything is passed
along with the music.
(George) The fact that! met so many people,
I can meet anybody you know.
You could go in all the film stars'
houses and Elvis and everybody
And we meta lot of really good people.
But we didn't... I never met one person
who really impressed me.
The first person who ever impressed me
in my life was Ravi Shankar.
And he was the only person
who didn't try to impress me.
(Man) Why did he impress you?
(George) Because it was by his being.
He taught me so much
without actually saying a word.
It's by example.
(Ravi Shankar)
Now try to count Five, five and six.
- Five, five makes 10.
- (George) Yeah.
(Ravi) And 6 makes 16.
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
- One, two, three, four, Eve.
- (Tabla)
One, two, three, four, Eve. One...
(George) Two, three, four, Eve. One, two.
(Ravi) Five. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.
(George) One, two, three, four, Eve.
(Ravi) Three, four, Eve.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
What you can do, or if
if it is difficult for you to get...
One, two, three, four Just..
- (George) One, two...
- (Ravi) Three, four
(Ravi laughs) It's quite difficult
(George) One, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four..
- No. One.
(George) One, two, three, four
If you're trying
to find something,
to find the source of that thing
is very difficult
but my blessing was to be able
to have Ravi as my patch cord.
And he could plug me in
to the real thing,
so my experience of it
was always the best quality.
(J' The Beatles: Love to You)
Each day just goes so fast
I tum around, it's past
You don't get time
to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
(George) Ravi and the sitar
was kind of like an excuse
to try and find
this spiritual connection.
I read stuff by various holy men
and Swamis and mystics
and I went around and looked for them.
Ravi and his brother gave me
a lot of books by some wise men.
One of the books which was
by a Swami Vivekananda who said,
"lf there's a God, you must see Him
and if there's a soul we must perceive it.
"Otherwise it's better not to believe.
"It's better to be an outspoken atheist
than a hypocrite."
And after all my life,
I've been brought up...
Well, they tried to bring me up
as a Catholic.
They had told you to just
believe what they're telling you
and, you know,
not to have the direct experience.
And this for me going to India
and hearing somebody saying, you know,
"No, you can't believe anything
until you have direct perception of it,"
And I thought,
"Wow, you know, fantastic!
"At last, you know, find somebody who...
who makes some sense."
And so I wanted to go deeper
and deeper into that.
I think that George's experiences
of expanding his mind with acid
led him to looking for something
that didn't need chemicals.
He knew that there was a point
where you couldn't keep on doing that.
And it wouldn't be good for you
if you did keep on using chemicals.
So he was looking for...
He was always looking for the truth
and he was also
looking for peace of mind.
Because it was...
It was pretty crazy.
(George) John'd pick us up
in this big Rolls-Royce
with blacked-out windows,
and Ringo, John and I
all moved out of town to Surrey.
And then he'd pick up Ringo
and then pick me up
and then we'd head into town
and by the time we got to Hammersmith,
we were just loaded, and...
And feeling ill cos, you know,
a Rolls-Royce doesn't have
the proper springs.
They just roll around.
And the black windows,
you couldn't see anything out,
and the windows would be shut
and so you'd just be getting
double doses of these reef ere,
And then, we'd pull up
at Abbey Road Studio
and just be like...
fall out of the car.
(Ringo) We have to thank Paul
that we made as many records as we did
because you know, John and I,
cos we lived in the same area,
would be hanging out, you know.
It's like a...
A beautiful day
in the garden in England
and the phoned ring
and we'd always Know it was him.
He wants us to work!
(George) I mean, everywhere we went,
people were smiling
and you know,
sitting on lawns, drinking tea.
When I went to Haight-Ashbury,
expecting it to be this brilliant place,
I thought it was gonna be all these
groovy kinda gypsy kinda people
with little shops making works of art
and paintings and carvings.
But instead, it turned out
to be just a lot of bums.
And many of them,
they were just very young kids
who'd come from all over America
and dropped acid
and gone to this Mecca of LSD.
We'd walk down the street
and I was like,
being treated like
the Messiah or something.
I was really afraid because
I could see all these spotty youths
and they were still undercurrents
of Beatlemania, but...
from a kind of twisted angle.
And they were...
People were handing me things
like this big pipe,
like a big Indian pipe
with feathers on it
and books and incense
and, you know, all kinds of stuff,
and trying to give me drugs
and, you know, I'd say,
"No, thanks, I don't want it."
We were walking quicker and quicker.
We went through the park
and back out of the park, and in the end
we just said, "Let's get outta here."
And we drove back to the airport,
got on the jet, and as it took off,
the plane went into a stall,
and the whole dashboard lit up,
saying "unsafe" right across.
It certainly snowed me what was
really happening in the drug cult.
It wasn't what I thought
of all these groovy people getting...
Having spiritual awakenings
and being artistic.
It was like any addiction.
So, at that point, I stopped taking it,
actually, the dreaded Lysergic
That's where I really went
for the meditation.
(J' The Beatles: Strawberry Fields)
Let me take you down
Cos I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
We'd stopped touring.
We were now into the mid-sixties.
We were partying.
And I think we kind of lost
sort of our spiritual direction.
Not that we ever had one
but we lost it.
So we were kind of
experimenting in anything.
It was the time of Sgt. Pepper.
And I'd written the song,
the title song.
And I put it to the guys
that what we should do,
we could make this record now
under another persona.
We'll be this other band.
And it will free us.
The idea was we could bring
anything we wanted.
Cos now, you know, there was
no lid on what we could do.
(George Martin)
When we were doing Sgt. Pepper,
he presented us with a song
which I thought was boring.
And I had to tell him so. And I said,
"George, honestly,
I think we could do...
"You could do
something better for this record
"cos it's gonna be an astonishing record
"there are so many great moments in it.
"And do you mind going away
and thinking about it
"and coming up with something else?"
(J' The Beatles: Within You Without You)
We were talking
About the
Space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves
Behind a wall
Of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away
He came up with
Within You Without You.
Now Within You Without You was not
a commercial song by any means.
But it was very interesting.
He had the way of communicating music
by the Indian system
of kind of a separate language like...
(imitates tabla percussion)
The kind of things that would be the
rhythms suggested by the tabla player.
And you had to get inside that
and find out what it was about.
So it was like
working out a puzzle with George.
He had Ravi play at his house once.
And we all went.
And we're sitting around the floor.
And Ravi made the announcement,
"Please don't smoke while I'm playing."
And, er, anyway,
there was a crowd of us
and a crowd of Ravi's friends
sitting around.
Ravi's playing away,
and this is how little we understood
at the time that...
Ravi's pals are all like going.,
Aww! Aghh!
Which it sounded like to us
they were saying, "Aw, God, crap!"
But they were really going...
(Sighs contentedly)
We were like, "Keep the noise down."
(Laughs) You know.
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come
J" When you see we're all one
And life flows on within you
And without you
- What, when you get a sort of typical...
- Yeah.
- ..westernised Englishman coming to you.
- Yeah.
What is the most important thing
you have to teach? Is it concentration?
No. Just allowing the mind to take
its natural course. Just that.
Say, it was surprising someone one day
has started to meditate,
next day he came for checking.
And he said, "I feel wonderful.
I slept very deep,
"and the whole thing is good.
"But tell me what you have taught me."
(Chuckles)
(Both laugh)
I said, "Nothing"
(Laughter)
Because the process of thinking
has not to be learned.
We are used to think.
We know how to think from birth.
(Screaming)
I got a message from John
and a message from Joe, saying,
"We're going to Wales.
We've met this guy.
"We listened to him. He's great.
Come to Wales."
(Paul) We'd seen this giggly
little Indian guy with a beard
coming on TV and we liked him.
You know, he was
a funny little character
who was gonna save the world.
So he came round
and we were ripe for saving.
(George) You know,
I wanted to get into meditation.
But it's one thing reading about it
and the other thing of how do you do it.
So I got myself to the point where,
OK, I need a mantra.
You know, where do you go?
You know, you go to Harrods
and get a mantra.
But then David Wynn showed me
this picture and he said,
"Oh, he's coming to do
a lecture at the Hilton.
"He's called Maharishi."
(David Frost) You give each person
a sound, don't you?
Is that the same sound
that you give to each person?
(Maharishi) No.
Each person gets different.
(Frost) How many sounds are there?
Oh, there are lots of them
I mean, hundreds or thousands, or...
We could say thousands.
And when a person has been given
their own particular sound,
how do they use it?
I mean, when they're meditating,
how do they use the sound
you've given them?
Why is that sound useful to them?
Ah! See, every man has his own impulse
of individuality, yes?
Some man goes by
and you feel attracted towards him.
Other man goes and you feel repulsed.
Something exchanged
in the rhythm of the individual.
Like, everyone has his own rhythm.
Now, the rhythm of a sound
which will resonate to the existing
rhythm of the individual.
And that will be the sound
suitable to him.
Got it. So that you try to find the...
Give the person the sound
that fits in with the rhythm
of their own lives and being.
(Paul) We were at
Maharishi's meditation camp
when the news came through
about Brian.
And it was horrifying
because we'd experienced loss,
but with Brian dying,
it was like one of us dying.
And you can kind of come to terms
with your parent dying because
you know they'll probably die before you.
But Brian, it was, whoa!
And it was such a big part
of the equation.
People used to call him
the fifth Beatle, you know.
So it was like, "Oh, my God,
now we're on our own,"
(George) It was very strange for it
to happen at that precise moment.
We'd just got involved
with this meditation.
You know, I mean, that may not sound
like a big deal, but it actually was.
It's a big change in your life when,
you know, when you start
making the journey inward.
And for Brian to like kick the bucket
that particular day,
it was pretty far out.
(Frost) Is the mantra
something you use
to get back to the subject
if you find earthly
or irrelevant thoughts intruding?
- Yeah, something like that.
- Or is it more than that?
You know, you just sort of sit there
and you let your mind go,
whatever it's going, doesn't matter
what you're thinking about
Just let it go.
And then you just introduce
the mantra or the vibration.
Just to take over from the thought.
You don't will it
or use your will power.
If you find yourself thinking then
the moment you realise you've been
thinking about things again
then you replace that thought
with the mantra again.
Sometimes you can go on
and you find that you haven’t even
had the mantra in your mind.
You've just been a complete blank.
But when you reach that point,
because it's beyond all experience,
then it's down there in that...
That level is timeless, spaceless
So you can be there for five minutes
and come out.
You don't actually know
how long you've been there.
Then the aim, as opposed to
sitting and thinking, or anything
is to reach a point
where you have no thoughts, is it?
(George) Mm.
(Chants mock mantra)
(Audience laugh)
(J' The Beatles: The Inner Light)
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
The word, for instance, the word "God,"
I mean has ...
Does it mean something different to you
now than it did before the Maharishi?
(John) It could be.
It means all sorts of things to me.
It means...
I mean, the first concept
of a man in the sky,
well, I kicked that one a few years ago.
But I've got back to that now
because it's a man in the sky
as well, if you like
it's just everything.
The whole thing that...
it's just everything.
Every aspect of creation
is part of God.
I think that perhaps we should try
and get it a little clearer,
what we're talking about.
If we're talking about
a mystical religious belief,
which I think that George Harrison is...
But are we really talking
about mysticism
or are we talking about
a technique of improving yourself
which is totally scientific and rational?
You can take it either way.
You can take it either way.
Well, that's easy.
This is because
it is a perceptual method.
If a man has got a great conceptual
apparatus and he meditates,
he will begin to understand the nature
of a conceptual apparatus,
and if he's wrong about it
he'll begin to understand
where he's wrong about it.
If he's got no conceptual apparatus,
he simply perceives
an abstract experience.
Now, when he's had
an abstract experience,
he may wish then to give
himself explanations of it.
But it's primarily a perceptual method.
And so what this offers
is an experience.
(John) Yeah.
(George) Yeah.
Why should this abstract experience
be any more valuable
than any other experiences?
You see, George Harrison talked
about a bliss experience.
Well, you can have a bliss experience
by drinking a bottle of whisky.
- (Several talk)
- You get a ha...
Now why...Why is a...
Why is his bliss experience...
(Frost) You'd have a hell of
a non-bliss experience the next morning.
...His abstract bliss experience
in anyway more valuable
than anybody else's bliss experience?
Or are we talking about a universe
which has some hidden laws
and a hidden creator
who manifests himself
only to people like
Mister Harrison and the Maharishi
when they get into a state of trance?
That's what I want to know.
Well, let's face it.
These laws that you say, hidden laws,
they are hidden.
But they're only hidden
by our own ignorance,
And the word mysticism is just
being arrived at through
people's ignorance.
There's nothing mystical about it,
only that you're ignorant
of what that entails.
(J' The Beatles: The Inner Light)
Arrive without traveling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
He wanted to be a spiritual being
more than anything.
But he couldn't, because
he had to deal with this life.
So he could be loving because
that was really his true nature
and sweet and kind and gentle.
But then the anger came from
the frustration of...
that he had.
When you glimpse something
that you understand
but you can't be there because there's
something earthly holding you back.
And he was very aware of that
(Man) What were the earthly things
that pulled on him the most?
Well, the three...
The other three Beatles.
And what they were creating
and were continuing to create.
This huge empire, Apple.
I think he felt that he'd found
something that he totally understood
and wanted to just be there.
Be in it.
He became totally absorbed
with meditation.
(Dhani reads) "Dear Mum,
thanks for your letter last week.
"And if it's any comfort to you,
don't worry about me
"or don't think
anything negative about Maharishi.
"Because he's not phoney
”lt's only the bullshit that's written
about him that's phoney
”He's not taking any of our money
"All he's doing is teaching us
how to Contact God.
"And as God isn't divided
into different sects
"as the religious leaders here
make out by their prejudices,
"then it doesn't affect my dedication
to Sacred Heart in any way
"It only strengthens it
"But we will help
to spread this teaching
"so that everybody can attain this.
"And new generations will grow up
and have this right from the start
"instead of going through the ignorance
that seems to dominate
"everything and everyone at the moment
"causing them to feel that
it's mysticism or something strange,
"or black magic.
”Don't think that I've gone off
my rocker because I haven’t
"Burl now love you and everybody else
much more than ever
"So it's not that bad, is it?"
(J' The Beatles: Savoy Truffle)
Creme tangerine
And Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert
Yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them
all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Whenever we were together
in the public, say, for instance,
l would turn... I mean,
for all of the amount of, uh,
weight that I thought I carried,
would turn to nobody.
If we were going
into a restaurant or a club,
the way people would behave around
their aura, you know.
And by "their", I mean the Beatles,
was beyond belief.
George had two sides to his character.
I mean, you know, I'm his mate,
so I can't tell too much.
But he was a guy.
You know. And you know
what I'm talking about.
He was like...
He was a red-blooded man, you know.
So he would like, you know,
the things guys like
(J' The Beatles: Savoy Truffle)
But you'll have to
have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
I distinctly remember
putting the saxes on.
And I got what I considered to be
a good sax sound, they...
blended well, it was very nice,
and George comes up
after teaching him the parts
and says, "Yeah, they sound great.
Now distort them."
"What'?"
"Yeah, they're too clean,
they're too nice. Distort them."
"OK" So I had to one way
or another mess them up.
When we were mixing it,
George Martin walks
into the control room. He says,
"isn't it a bit bright?
Isn't it a bit toppy'?"
And George just turned around
to him and said,
"Yeah And I like it."
And he just turns around
and we carry on working.
George just upped and...
George Martin just walked out.
Went to one of the other studios
where they were doing other work.
They were like the kids
that've just left home,
and parents aren't
looking after them any more.
(J' Psychedelic rock)
(Clapton) A guy called
Joe Massot was making this film
and he'd asked George
to do the soundtrack.
And it was really just...
I showed up, you know.
George told me
he'd like me to play on something
or we'd write something
as we went along.
We put down this thing and...
George then put
backwards guitar on top of it.
It was very experimental
and it was good fun.
I think that in England
there was a sort of cultural revolution
in the sixties,
which touched on every branch of life.
Wake up!
(Shutter clicking)
You can thank your lucky stars
you're working for me, can't you?
And a smile now. Come on.
Smile.
Smile!
(Continues clicking)
God.
That's why Antonioni decided
to do Blow-Up in England
because of it being the...
the spot where everything
was going on.
What do they call you in bed?
(Sniggers)
I only go to bed to sleep.
I remember the mystery
that was around George Harrison.
I wouldn't have asked him a question.
I wouldn't have dared,
because of, um, feeling he...
he was onto something else.
There was a lot of energy around.
Everybody was inspiring everybody else.
We'd go to David Hockney's studio
and watch him paint.
And, um...
"Oh, David, can I just have that little sketch?"
And he'd say, "No, you can't,"
(Laughs)
And then we'd go off and he'd say,
"Oh, let's go and see the Stones.
"They're recording at so and so,"
Then off we'd go there.
So we could just do anything.
Nobody minded.
Everybody was flying around like that.
It was, um, all so possible and so easy
and we didn't think twice about it.
(J' The Beatles: Revolution 9)
I was in New York
and some people came and said,
"Aren't you gonna come to London?
"London is swinging.
London is great!"
And I think, "Well, I don't know."
You know.
I was so New York, you know,
I didn't want to sort of leave New York.
But then things happened and I went
to London and it was really great.
There was a kind of feeling of freedom
and I felt that it's almost like the...
the air was kind of a...
had an intelligent smell about it. Yeah?
George and John and I
made Number Nine.
And that was actually George
who sort of instigated it.
He said, "Let's do it,
let's do it." You know.
And he didn't have that feeling of...
Well, Yoko is a separate thing
and, you know, we shouldn't, sort of,
be nice to her or anything like that.
He was just very nice.
I thought it's very interesting
to know about what the Beatles do.
Because, you know, I come from
an avant-garde background and all that.
And here they were
making music in a way that
was very different
from what we used to do.
It had power of its own.
And I thought,
"Well, this is what you can do."
(12-bar instrumental)
George had two sides,
like we all do, you know.
Sometimes he was very nice
and sometimes he was, um...
just being too honest or something.
(Chuckles)
Frank about things, you know.
He would say something right away,
before he's thinking.
So he didn't mince words.
And sometimes it's, you know, "Oh, dear.
Do you think that?" or something.
He'd just hurt me maybe.
But, he... John said,
"Oh, that's George, you know."
And I got used to that, too.
It was very nice.
I remember a particular occasion when
I'd written Hey Jude
and I brought it in.
And I go...
 Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
And George was playing...
- Hey, Jude
- (imitates riffing)
- Don't make it bad 
- (imitates riffing)
And I had to sort of say,
"No, George, look,
"I really don't think
you can put a guitar riff
"after every line, you know."
And it was like a real,
"Oh, OK then."
But, you know, I knew he couldn't do it.
Maybe he knew he couldn't do it.
But it created tension, you know.
And it was like...
Then this feeling that
I was just dictating things
started to grow, you know.
And I was dictating things
cos I knew how I wanted my song to go.
Similarly, John would say
how he wanted his song to go,
or George would say
how he wanted his to go.
The intensity that they had together
must have had its limits
and it had to explode at some point.
Now they were out in London,
traveling a lot
and getting...and having
different people influence them.
So coming back together,
it didn't work as well.
I quit the band in '67,
on the White Album, because, uh...
I was just in, I don't know,
in some emotional state
where I honestly felt
that I wasn't playing well.
For some reason I felt
I just wasn't playing good.
And those three were really close.
And I thought,
"Well, I gotta deal with this anyway."
So, you Know, I went over to John's...,,
He was staying with Yoko in my apartment
and I said, "Look, man,
"you know, I've gotta say, look,
I feel I'm not playing really good.
"And you three are really close."
He goes, "I thought it was you three."
And I went to Paul's and knocked
on his door and I said the same thing.
I said, "You Know,
and you three are really close."
"I thought it was you three!"
And I thought, "Oh, shit,
I'm goin' on holiday. I'm off."
And I went to Sardinia.
When I got back,
when they said, "Oh, come on back.
We love you." Blah, blah, blah.
George had decorated the whole studio
with flowers, you know.
And, you know, that was
a beautiful moment for me.
(J' The Beatles:
While My Guitar Gently Weeps)
I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
J" While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
And I see it needs sweeping
J” Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why
Nobody told you
J” How to unfold your love J”
It was crap, you know. We were trying to
do the song and it wasn't happening.
You know, they weren't
taking it serious.
And I don't think they were
even all playing on it.
And so, I went home that night
and I just thought,
"Well, that's a shame cos I Know
this song is pretty good."
And then the next day
I was driving into London with Eric,
and I said, "Hey, what are you doing?
"Why don't you come to the studio and,
you know, play on this song for me."
And he says, "Oh, no, I can't do that.
"You know, nobody's ever played
on a Beatles' record.
"And, you know,
the others wouldn't like that."
And I said, "Well, you know,
hard luck, it's my song,
"and I'd like you to play on it."
We'd all learned to grow together
and, you know, some days
one'd grow a little taller,
and the next day
someone else'd grow tall,
you know what I mean?
It's how we were.
(Clapton) lt'd been a few years
since I'd seen them,
and they had changed.
And this particular song
was a strong view of...
And it was coming very much from
where George had found himself
as a result of becoming involved
with mysticism.
And seeing John and George and Paul
sing together, when they were doing
harmonies and things, and Paul playing,
I mean it was fantastic.
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
