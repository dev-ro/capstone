And used all the oil.
So can I get little oil on loan from your place?
I need it to remove the makeup.
Wait a minute.
Why did you close the door?
I want to tell you one secret.
You know Bunty, Bunty.
Never trust him.
He is not worthy enough to be trusted.
So this is your secret?
No, no. 
Ah... the secret is something else.
I wanted to praise you.
I wanted to tell you that all are praising you so much.
Do you know what they are saying?
They say that you are an expert dancer.
And the pair is even better than super-duper hit.

No, no, brother.
Please, please tell me.
Please tell me what happened next?
Tell me.
You ate everything?
Nothing was left?
Don't tell anyone. 
It is a matter of my respect.
Why I would I tell, friend?
This is your advance, sir.
Your show was brilliant.
What is the name of the actress?
She was good.
Where do I have to sign?
- You have to sign here.
Now listen, it is decided then that on 29th."
...you will take your whole group to London.
- Yes!
Full one month program is finalized. 
Ok.
I hope the heroine will be the same, right?
I have signed it.
Help! Help!
Why, help?
What happened? 
What's the matter?
The sister got scared!
He tried to touch me in the bathroom.
But sister, I was just checking your flute.
You'll check sister's flute in the bathroom?
The people who try to be fresh with their sister's, do you...
...know what are they called...?
Since when is she your sister?
Good that you people came.
If you had not come then...
...I don't know what he would have done to me today?
Listen you chaste woman, do not try lo act smart.
Yesterday when he had come to your room then you...
...were jumping all round and having a ball.
What are you saying?
What have I done?
Did you hear that, sir?
This so called chaste woman is asking...
What have I done?
When last night he had come to your room at that time you...
...did not say anything. 
And now you started to scream?
Tell me, what special qualities does he have which...
...I don't have?
Stop it!
Hey my hair! Hey!
- Stop! Stop!
I am telling you, last night he had come to my room...
Forget about last night.
Talk of now.
Babla, had you gone lo her room last night?
Tell us had you gone there or not.
Last night... I... I had gone to sleep at 7 o'clock.
Oh God this animal!
He is such a lair, sir. Ask him...
Didn't tell me last night that you had gone to her room?
After I woke up I did not meet anyone, really.
You did not meet me?
- When?
Then.
- Then, when?
Sir, I am really telling you...
...that you should drive this man from here.
Quiet! Absolutely silent. Quiet.
First you apologies to her.
No, I'll not apologies.
- I am telling you apologies.
I will not apologies, sir.
All this happened because of this rascal.
Come to London. I'll see you there.
- Listen...
If he behaves like this in the broad day light then what...
...will happen to us women in London?
Apologies will not do.
This lust crazy man should be...
...punished for sure.
Behold! Another chaste woman has spoken.
What do you say, sir.
Should I call the Police.
 - Yes!
Stop it. Be quiet.
Do not create a racket, rascals.
If the organizer hears this then what will he think of me?
Agreed that you are not honourable people.
But think of my honour.
In my 30 years' career this kind of thing has never happened.
But since you both have come...
...my age has doubled. Really.
That is alright.
But he should be punished, right?
- Yes!
What punishment? 
Why punishment?
So you have forgotten. Sir, the show which we had staged...
...in Nagpur, I had called the organizer's daughter a...
...buffalo then I was given the punishment of dish washing.
When I had not even called her a buffalo.
But he has committed a crime.
He at least be punish with...
...washing the laundry.
Yes. From today for the ext one month you'll wash...
...everybody's dirty laundry. Happy?
- Happy-
Gk. NOW everybody go k: your rooms.
These are everybody's Passport.
You tell everyone to take care of them like a treasure.
Got it.
Sir, sir.
- What is it? Don't shout.
That heroine... Take this.
She is not coming to London.
Poor boss... Boss...

Someone gel some water.
Someone see what happened.
- What happened? 
- Sir...
Sir, sir.
Water. 
Sir, sir...
Press his chest.
Sir, sir...
What happened?
This has happened because of you both.
Because of both of you my heroine is refusing to come.
Because of both of them no girl stays for long in our show.
I am saying that you should throw them out.
Throw us out, throw us out.
Give him water. Here, Sir, water.
Sir, I am telling you that we'll do something or the other...
...once we reach there.
What will you do?
Will you wear her blouse and petticoat?
What will you do?
Sir, a lot of Indian people live there.
- Yes.
We'll find some heroine Or the other.
That's what I was saying.
We do not have any other option.
We'll think about it when we reach there.
But let us first go to London.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome!
- Thank you.
- Has everyone come?
Yes, all are here.
Who are you looking for?
Your main actress has not come?
The show is on Friday, right?
- Yes.
So she will come after two days.
Her uncle is dead. - Oh!
Her mother's brother died.
She is coming after 2 days
OK. Then it's fine.
All of you go in the bus...
...with along with your own luggage.
And you are the director, right?
Yes.
- You come with me in the taxi.
Gullu, keep his luggage in the taxi.
Rest of you, go in the bus.
- Come, come. Welcome!
Listen, do not smoke and do not spit.
This is not India, and don't make it one.
Please come. Come.
Everybody get out of the bus.
Please come, welcome. Welcome.
Come on, everyone carry your own luggage and get down.
Every one proceed to the reception counter...
...and take the
keys to your rooms.
Welcome] Welcome!
This red bag...
- Hey, my bag too.
And listen!
- Yes.
This entire motel has been booked for you only.
No one else will live here except you people.
I've arranged for everything.
But there is no facility.“...
...for doing laundry.
Not to worry.
We have brought a man with us to do...
...the laundry.
- Is he a 'Dhobi' (Washer man}?
He is a Dhobi or something else.
I don't know.
Ah ha! There is a 'Dhobi'.
Yes, there is a Dhobi.
Dhobi is here.
Quiet! 
Listen, is there any arrangement for food and all?
There is no problem of food.
There is a kitchen.
Utensils are there.
Everything is there.
Bu! there is no cook.
You will have to do the cooking yourselves and eat.
Because there is no one else living here, except you all.
No Room Service!
Hey, Gullu! 
Come here.
- I am already here.
Gullu taxi driver, will stay with you for the entire day today.
Whatever you want you can tell him to get from the market.
He will get for you whatever you want.
Gullu, take care of them.
They are our people.
They should not get out of our hand.
Understood?
- Yes.
Now be comfortable.
Think this as your own motel.
Now I'll take your leave.
 Now I will meet you all on the...
...the day of the show.
This is height of decency.
Come, Gullu. Come.
- But, money...
Has everybody had their lea, breakfast and have all bathed?
I have not finished.
- What's your problem?
The room is being set.
That is OK.
But our biggest problem is that
we do not have a heroine.
That problem has been taken care of.
How did you manage that?
Listen, the story will be the same but...
the hero and the heroine are changed.
Who is the heroine?
- I am
What?!
- I am the hero and this Vaijanthi is the heroine.
- Yes.
Then one thing is clear.
This is our last show and after this...
...we go straight back to India.
You shut up.
It is because of you the heroine ran away.
Whatever it is...
...at least the public won't tear our clothes!
I was thinking that if sir becomes the hero and she...
...becomes the heroine then what would be it's title.
Signal... Signal of old age...
Stupid! Idiot! Keep quiet.
Sir, these voices can not be muffled, understand?
Sir, sir, there is a threat from my side.
If she becomes the heroine of this play then I'll play...
...the part of the villain.
Why will you become the villain.
Why you.
I always play the part of the villain so this time also...
...I will become the villain.
Why, you wanted to become the hero.
Now that you've got a chance then why don't you do it?
Brother, I want lo become a hero and not somebody's son.
What?
And I also do not want to become somebody's grandson!
Shut up! Shut up!
Quiet! Quiet! Now there is only one option open.
And everybody will have to go with it.
Whoever finds a heroine and brings her here will play...
...the part of the 'Hero'.
Otherwise, I'll do the show...
...with her and I'll not pay even a single rupee lo anyone.
Then you can do whatever you want.
12,13, 14...
Oh, you are minting Sterling Pound!
The Taxi is on hire.
Sol have to give the account everyday.
But why are you carrying that bag and walking?
You know they are cleaning the place.
- Oh!
What a strange weather?
I tell you, you can not trust London's weather and...
...London's girls.
Anytime they keep changing colours.
Why'? Are the girls not nice?
No, it is just a saying.
The girls are very good.
But how is their nature.
Do they make friends or not?
Whoever comes here asks the same thing one way...
No! No! It is nothing of that sort.
I was just asking...
- Oh! Just like that...
Move, move.
- What happened?
What happened?
- Sit inside.
What?
- What type of girl do you want?
Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, English...
- Shall I tell you the truth?
- Yes.
I want an Indian girl.
What?
You are in a foreign country and you want...
...an Indian girl?
- What to do, the game is such.
Oh... I have understood now.
Everyone has their own style...
...of playing this game.
-Lot of people come and ask me.
What?
-Who else has asked you?
Now, nobody has asked me.
I said it just like that.
- Oh?
When do you want it?
- Today.
Today?!
- Right now.
Right now?!
- Yes.
Oh! You can not hold.
What to do the want is such.
No, no, it is not such a want.
- I! is OK. OK!
Listen! Listen!
- Yes?
For one month.
- For one month?!
The same one? Same taste?
You also...
No, it is not that...
ll is OK.
You are still not married, that is why.
I have understood.
I've understood everything.
And listen!
- Yes?
She should be able to speak Hindi.
She should know Hindi also?
- Yes. She should know Hindi.
I see, there should be no communication problem.
He wants for one month, and...
...she should speak dialogues in Hindi too.
He wants for one month, and she should speak dialogues in Hindi too.
Dialogues are important.
I liked it.
The way you said it, liked it.
Listen, listen!
- Yes?
The girl should look like a heroine.
She should be a dancer also!
Oh! You seem to be a man of varied tastes.
Now you don't worry.
She will do whatever you tell her to do.
If you tell her to dance she will dance.
If you spent money then there is nothing that can't be done.
By the way how much money will she take?
You forget about it.
The amount she will tell you.
Why are you getting worried about it?
You do what I tell you to do.
Go to your right from the signal.
Then from the 4th signal turn left.
Then you will come across a very big park.
There you'll...
...find a lot of Indians standing.
But do not ask any white.
The moment the Indians see you they will understand.
They will try to befriend you.
Then you ask them whatever you want.
But beware of the Police.
Remember that.
Listen, the talk which we had between you and me...
...do not tell anyone about it.
Lot of people will ask you.
- You need not worry about that.
They will ask.
- Now you go and do your job.
All the best!
Listen to me...
You speak!
- You speak. - You speak.
No, you speak.
- No you speak.
If we find a heroine then I'll become the hero.
Yes, but for only this show.
In the next show I'll be the hero.
Otherwise that old man will become the hero.
The dwarf had said that I'll meet a lot of Indians here...
...who will try to befriend me and introduce me lo the heroine...
But I can'!
see anyone here.
Look! Look!
Not at me.
Look over there.
I think these are the people.
Come.
Ask! Ask! Ask!
The dwarf had said that they will ask first.
Really? They are coming towards us.
- I am seeing.
Do you have a light?
Is he angry? Ask him.
That... He... Heroine...
Don't say heroin, say 'pouch, pouch.'
Doll?
- Pouch.
He is saying 'pouch'.
- Pouch'?

Yes. Did you gel the money?

I hope nothing went wrong?
Yes, Boss.

How did the Police know about this?
That we don't know.
- Bu! we escaped.
Open the bag.
Excuse me, Boss.
La! La!
These briefs, vests, pant and shins...
What is all this?
Where is the money?
Boss, we had exchanged the bags correctly.
Even the code word was same.
We asked for a light.
He gave me a light.
I said, packet. 
He said, packet.
Did he say packet or old woman?
Then what is all this?
What did he say'?
Manubhai Gandhi here. What?!
Now I've understood.
Our entire material has been nabbed by the Police.
Police? How is that possible, boss'?
That has happened.
Just now Sher Khan has told me
...thal his people have been arrested by the Police.
The Police must have tortured them and got the code word.
That means that the rascal Commissioner G.D. Mehra...
...has appointed Indian C.l.D to nab our drug deals.
The people with whom you finalised the deal...
...were Secret Police.
Yes, Boss.
Look, my image here is that of a very big builder.
And I do not want to tarnish it. OK?
Now you go out and be careful.
And do not come back here.
Now get out from here.
Get out I said. Get out!
One coffee please.
This is a strange city.
For the first time in my life I've seen...
...such a thief who takes away my bag but leaves back his bag.
I don't think that they were thieves.
They were something else.
I think it is altogether a different ball game.
Let us open the bag and see.
No. Not ere. 
There's lot of public here. No here.
Where
- Let us go lo a place where there's nobody.
Let's go there.

Yes, boss. We have seen them with these eyes...
...entering this hotel.
You idiots!
Why have you both come hereto gel me killed?
Now because of you both I'll be caught.
Police!
They will not be able lo catch me.
What is all this?
I think it is flour.
Is it flour? Flour?
No! These are drugs.
Drugs?!
- Yes.
With this you get intoxicated.
This is quite dangerous.
- Yes.
This has been kept by mistake.
We'll be in more grave danger.
- Yes. Shut it close.
H... a... n... d!
Wait! Wait! 
What to do with this bag?
Let me think.
Now what is there to think'!
Let us throw away the material...
...and keep the bag.
It will be useful to us sometime.
It is a good bag.
- Have you gone out of your mind?
Do you know what's it worth?
1 crore rupees.
1 crore rupees? 
This thing?
It is not worth more than 5000 rupees.
You moron, I am not talking about the bag.
I am talking about the material inside ii.
1 crore rupees for this garbage.
Do you think I am mad'?
Yes. You uneducated idiot,
lam a graduate in English.
Understood?
To know about all these things one needs intelligence.
Which you don't have, but I have!
Hey listen, what I am saying.
Listen.
If really this material is worth...
...1 crore rupees then let us sell it.
At least then we will not have to dance lo the lune of...
...Mr. Champak for the rest of our lives.
We will forget Mr. Champak and live life happily.
What do you say, should we sell this material?
Yes, sell it. Sell it.
You do one thing... - Yes?
You put a rug on the road side and start calling out...
Take the drugs! Take the drugs!
But then will the public come lo buy it?
Yes, they will come.
They will come in uniform.
Police... Excuse me, where is the Police Station.
Listen, I am from Russia.
Don't ask me stupid questions.
They will arrest you and take you and put you behind bars...
...for 2 lo 3 three years.
No brother, then we'll do a thing that we'll lake this garbage...
...and throw it in the garbage bin and get...
mourselves out of this garbage.
We will go to the police station.
We will give the goods lo them.
And then we will tell them to arrest us...
...we are dieing to get arrest
Have you gone mad! Why
are you talking rubbish!
Were you born abnormally!
Have you gone mad!
In fact they will reward us for our honesty.
And my photo too will be Published.
Like this.
Why not mine?
That loo will be published.
But it will be a small one.
- Why?
Because you don't have a degree.
Let me think.
For that you need brains.
You just listen to what I have to say.
No, even then...
- Taxi!
Come soon idiot. 
Come soon.
Do you believe we are stupid guys.
Someone gave you drugs and run away.
Officer, please try and understand.
Listen, I am from India.
And I speak only the truth.
Shut up! 
- Move aside.
I will explain to them.
Listen, officer.
This is the limit!
We had come here to act in a drama.
We needed a heroine for our drama.
Such a trivial matter.
And that fool told us, go and stand in that garden.
People who are there, they provide heroines.
I went there and stood like decent guys.
Just then two guys who looked like bulls came there.
They were wearing black goggles.
A black and a fair one.
Black glasses on fair skin.
And both are blind.
They put the cigarette in their mouth.
And they asked me, do you have matchstick.
I too decently took out the matchbox.
And I lit up the matchstick.
And then the guy blows it.
He extinguished the matchstick.
I asked him will we get a heroine.
He said no, you will gel Pooja.
I thought maybe in your country you worship heroines.
Sol said pouch is fine, perform the veneration.
As soon as I said it, he gave me his bag...
...and he took my bag.
And he ran away.
We too could have run away.
But brother got an inspiration.
And we came here like fools.
Sir, we have two Indians here with a case of drugs
But we don't understand their language.
Okay, sir.
Good Morning sir.
- Good Morning
Send them in.
Hey come on, let's go.
Where are we going?
- For a picnic.
Now you shut your loud speaker And don't talk there.
I will talk to the senior officer.
- OK.
2 men came, gave you the bag and went away.
Sir, we are Indians.
Sir, brother-brother.
Shut up and answer the question.
I agree.
But this bag full of drugs was found with you.
I will either have to arrest you both...
...or you will have lo prove your innocence
How...?
Do you have anybody in London, who will sign on the statement...
...and get you bail?
No, no, sir. Not in London.
But we have many people in India.
If you say we will call them here, but who will pay the fare?
You don't talk.
Otherwise he will again put us in the lock up.
Sir, there is a taxi driver.
Bu! the problem is that I don't know where he stays.
The taxi's number?
Yes... the taxi's number...
LH... AG...

If the police didn't thrash us black and blue...
...lhen it was only because my mother...
...had done some good deeds in the past life.
Yesterday's kids are leaching us.
Heroine for a drama.
It's very tough.
There is one man who can do it.
If he can't do it, then it's a lost case.
Who?
- Guru.
Guru? I don't want to deal with sages...
- His name is Guru.
Before he was a band master.
A girl used to dance in his group.
She was fabulous dancer.
I don't wan! to get a 'Mujra' done.
Listen to me first.
Western classical dance.
After that I don't know what happened.
Guru stopped singing and he started drinking.
If he is a drunkard than from where will he get a girl?
Give him a couple of bottles.
Whiskey.
Guru.
Guru.
- Yes.
Actually the thing is that a movie hero has come.
He has a small problem.
You can help him.
That's why I have brought this bottle.
Please solve his problem.
Brother! Come, come.
- What happened?
 He gave his consent?
Not yet, but it will be done.
You don't worry.
I lied a bit about you.
I said you make movies and you are the main hero in that.
What's wrong in a drama?
No girl will work in a drama, TV serial.
- Bull...
Do you want a girl or not'?
- Yes.
Then you come quietly and don't eat my brains.
But I want a 'Kancha' girl.
You don't want to perform a drama, but play with her?
I mean a beautiful girl.
- Come, come.
You have gone mad slaying in London.
- Come, come.
Coming, coming.
Guru.
- Who's that?
He is Mr. Bunty.
Touch his feet.
- Greetings.
Do you know him? His name is Bunty.
- Bunty?
You must have heard about his movies?
He directs his own movie and he is the lead hero in that.
Guru, I am not that person.
He is that person.
I had spoken to you about him.
Then who are you?
I am Gullu, the cab driver.
Okay, you are Gullu.
And he is the cab driver.
No, no. I am both of it.
- Then who is he?
He is Bunty!
What is he doing in the movies?
Hey, you both don't make me go mad.
Enough of it!
Ask him that the reason why I have come here...
...I want to solve that problem.
Ask him where will I find the girl.
You want women?
No, no. Not women.
He wants one girl to work in the movie.
And that too an Indian girl.
- You will get it.
Guru, that girl...
please arrange fast.
I forgot. 200 years ago...
- 200 years!
2 years... 2 years.
There was a girl in Rock and Roll group.
You can have her.
What was her name?
Tell him the name!
Padminil Shankhnil Mohini.
Not old times names.
Tell him some modern names.
Julie, Seema, Reema...
Hakka.
Is this some witch's name'? Hakka.
It is not a witch's name.
It's my man's name.
Not man, he wants a girl.
- Shut up!
Hakka... is my man.
Go to him and he will tell you where the girl stays.
Then let's go.
- Where?
To Hakka's place. To find Hakka.
I forgot.
One minute.
If you would have met me yesterday... I would...
...have introduced the heroine then.
You don't know that I have high contacts.
I know almost all the heroines.
You know, my mom was English, and my pop...
...Come, sit in the car.
And I am the result.
We have reached so quickly.
Hakka, come out.
You gel in. 
We have not started the car.
Come... I am there...
Is he mad? I hope he
won't ruin all my money.
No. You don't worry.
Everything will be right.
- Sure?
Everything will be fine. Let's go.
Have we reached there?
We have still not reached.
Why do you get out again and again?
Let's go!
Hey Boys! Had Hakka come here?
Some people had come to recover money.
Since then he is missing.
Must be at home.
What's the matter, Guru?
This man wants lo sign him for his movie.
Anybody knows Hakka's home?
This drunkard...
- Yes, I know it.
Why are you all guys coming?
Hey what are you all doing?
Only 1-2 guys come.
Why is everybody coming?
Move.

She will move on her own.
Not this side!
Turn that side!
Hey, lady in sari!
Want to die!
- Yes, I want to die!
You found my car to die!
There are so many cars on this street!

Go home and quarrel!
Don't do it at a public place.
Why should I tell you?

- I am your brother...
Oh God!
 You slapped her!
Gullu, take out the cab!
Have you gone mad!
How can we leave her like this and go away?
Then what should I do?
Just think. If anything happened to her...
...then you will hanged for committing a murder...
...and I will be imprisoned.
I have not murdered her!
Have you gone mad!
Who saw you and her fighting'?
That car driver.
What if he went to the court and say it?
Then... then what will we do?
Tell me, dwarf.
Hang on!
Somebody will see us! Tell me!
Hey! Will she do for you?
Have you gone mad! lam talking about my problem.
And you are talking about supplying girls.
I am not talking about that.
You want a girl for your drama, don't you?
Is she fine'?
She? - Yes.
This suicidal girl?
 - Yes, yes.
Have you gone mad!
If she commits suicide during the show...
...then people will damage the chairs...
...they will tear my clothes
And the boss will commit suicide then.
I don't want her.
You don't have any other choice. Just think about it.
You need a heroine.
And she is going to commit suicide.
Why does a person commit suicide?
Tell me!
Because he has some tension or some problem.
She loo has some financial problem.
That's why she was going to commit suicide.
If you will take her as a heroine...
...then her financial problem will be solved.
Your problem about a heroine will be solved.
She will be happy and you too will be happy.
And is as it is I am happy.
Take the decision!
I think God has given you the right opportunity.
What if she refused?
Then we will leave her here again.
What do we care?
We don't have anything to do with it?
- Yes.
We will tell her to leave?
- Yes.
Sure? 
- Yes.
Fine.
Carry her.
You hold her sari.
I will hold her blouse.
- Come on, lift her
She seems to be from a well lo do family.
How do you know?
She is so heavy.
Then accordingly your family must be very poor.
Really, she is too heavy!
Does she eat the neighbors' kids?
You kept her on my hand!
What is this?
- Now what happened?
Where did he go? That drunkard'?
Where is that drunkard'?
Hope he didn't run away in this madness.
Let him die, why should we bother?
Let's go.
Now what are looking below the tyre?
Come, please, please.
Sir! Sir! That Bunty!
He has died!
No, he has brought a heroine!
Move! Excuse me! 
Let Madam enter.
Excuse me! Come!
Take it easy. Silence!
Hey hero.
Give me this bag.
Come, don't look here and there.
Come, come.
This is my room.
Now it's yours.
- What about you?
I will stay at the storehouse.
Are you sure? - Yeah.
Ladies bathroom is here.
You can use that.
And this is...
I showed you your room.
You go and rest in your room. OK?
If you need anything, Anything...
...sir, move, then call me.
Okay. Okay.
No need for thanks, she is our Heroine!
Hey Dude! 
- Move your hand.
- Introduce this girl lo us too.
Tell her about your and our truth.
I have told her what I had to tell her about you guys.
Don't expect anything more from me.
You guys are acting so smugly.
Hey, give me your hand.
This girl is perfect for the role oi a heroine.
But tell me one thing. 
- What?
From where did you abduct this girl?
I have not abducted her.
She is my uncle's best friend's daughter.
Hi, Rupa. 
Had your bath?
Your uncle? Here in London?
- Why?
Strange! Your family has never ventured out of Borivali.
And your uncle is in London?
- Gel lost!
I have no problem, if she becomes my heroine.
Do you have any problem?
What? What? 
What did you say?
You don't have any problem?
I do have a problem.
Sir, my uncle's best friend has said this...
...that Munni will work only in the play in which I am the hero.
And he has also said that she will eat and drink...
...only what I give her.
I will look after her.
And he has also said that she won't talk to anybody.
Sir, you don't let this happen.
He is snatching a hero's role from a hero.
Sir, this is his ruse!
My ruse! 
Sir, I am plotting a ruse!
- Yes.
Sir, I edit hero's role!
I will do it for him too.
Sir, have you ever heard that a villain...
...brings heroine for a hero?
Have you ever heard of it?
Hero is the one who takes away the heroine...
...in front of the villain.
That's it ! 
So it's decided!
It's decided that from today you will...
...be the villain and I will be the hero.
No problem.
Hey detective!
Who are you to take the decision?
What are you doing!
Sir, you decide! You decide.
You will have to go and search for an Heroine.
No, no. - What did he say?
What is your problem in being the villain?
There are 2 fights.
You will get the chance lo kick him.
Do it.
Bull have always been the hero in all the plays.
You have been a hero so many times before!
Does he look like a hero?
You don't talk about face and features.
Otherwise I will have to find another guy.
I had told you before!
I heard it!
I had told you before!
The guy who will bring the heroine, he will be the hero.
The guy who does it, he is the winner.
That's it! Now will you play the role of a villain?
Don't waste time, will you play the role of a villain or not?
What happened to your nail'?
The decision is made!
Come! Let's go!
Go to your rooms! Come on!
Go and brush in the bathroom.
Come on.
Okay! Bye-bye!
OK, but I will be the villain in your real life.
What are you looking at'?
How beautiful it is?
- That pair of swan?
No, water. How deep would it be?
I have not measured that.
I will come to know
if I jump in II.
Shall I jump? - What?
You only said that it's deep.
I will jump in and check.
I will jump in the deep, cold water.
And my warn breath will leave my body gradually.
After a short while, the body will start floating.
And with the waves, it will float away.
Hey! Go in! 
Go in!
It will float away!
Has this bull entered the buffaloes den?
Let me see...
What was the need for you lo come here...
...so late in the night to say this?
But you will have to stay here carefully.
Hey!
What are you doing?
You are here?
- Where else will I be?
I thought you were inside.
Sir!
The bull has gone mad!
Leave me!
I won't leave you!
I won't leave you!
Sir, this man is not needed here.
Not needed here!
Sir, I don't want this man here.
His thoughts are very filthy!
Do you know what he was doing?
He was peeping in Munni's room!
He was teasing a sleeping woman.
Babla!
What rubbish!
Leave me!
Sir, he is lying!
He is lying!
He is talking rubbish!
I was looking out for him!
Why were you searching for me in her room?
If you were looking out for me, then you should...
...have search the bathroom.
You sleep in the bathroom?
Sir, I don't sleep in the bathroom!
Sir, ask him.
Wasn't he peeping in Munni's room?
Ask him!
Were you peeping in Munni's room, Babla?
Now, what can I say...
Caught him! Caught him!
Were you peeping or not?
I was peeping inside because I wanted to know who is inside!
Who will be inside! Sir,
who will be inside?
Poor Munni is inside!
She is sleeping]
She was snoring!
Poor Munni, were you peeping at her from the bathroom?
Leave me! 
Let me talk!
Listen!
I heard a man's voice inside.
I saw it with my own ears.
- Oh God!
I heard it!
Why don't I die!
Why don't I die!
- Go and die!
Sir! Sir, he is such a filthy man!
To save himself, he is slandering Munni's image!
Sir, ask him!
Ask him!
Hang on!
Sir, to end the matter, open the door.
The girl's room's door... what is she doing!
I will check it out!
No, you won't see it!
I will see it!
Sir, you won't see it. Sir!
I will see, I am company's boss.
I will see.
Munni! - Munni!
Its sir. Don't fear.
Open the door.
Open the door. Open the door.
Munni... is somebody inside?
There's no one, sir.
There's no one.
Fine, you go to sleep.
Good night.
What goodnight! Wait!
Did somebody check inside?
Munni, with whom were you talking?
Nobody, Babla.
I heard you talking to somebody.
That... that I was rehearsing my dialogues.
You guys said that it should be ready by morning.
What happened?
Hey!
Sir, this bull has gone mad!
I will bury you alive!
- The guy is hitting me!
Leave him!
Aren't you ashamed!
Go and apologize to the girl!
Go!
Go and apologise!
Remember one thing!
If you will respect the girl...
...then the girl will give you her respect.
Sorry! Made a mistake, sir!
Punish him, sir!
Otherwise I won't stay here.
What punishment?
Forgot! Forgot!
When by mistake I had leased Anjali...
...you all had made me wash the clothes.
Forgot it, sir?
Remind him.
If he is not punished then I will...
What?
Otherwise I will leave Munni at her home!
Understood!
Yes!
He is right!
He should be punished!
Law should be the same for everybody!
What trouble is this!
Hey!
From tomorrow you will cook for everybody!
Are you happy?
- Yes.
Its fine for now.
But I will give the rest...
...of the punishment later.
Everybody go and sleep in their room.
Bu! listen, nobody will go near that room!
Understood!
Nobody will go there!
Then do one thing.
You stand outside the room at
night like a watchman. Fool!
You keep awake the whole night just lo peep inside.
You guys have made my life miserable!
What are you looking at'?
The burning flame looks so beautiful.
Is it?
Then immerse yourself in it.
Eat it.
Burning flame looks so beautiful.
I will like if this fire eats me.
Then Munni wont be there, and problems also wont be there.
I will turn onto ashes and fly away in the sky.
Like a free bird!
Hey! If you want to make lea, then make tea.
Otherwise go out.
Fool, she scared me.
Bunty, did you drink your tea.
Shall I start now?
We will do the rehearsal of the gun.
Okay.
Yes sir, play the music.
What happened, sir?
Ready. Ready... - Look here.
Yes sir, play the music.

You helped me write the show.
That's nothing.
Nowadays, even you have started laughing.

Who does not have a problem in his life?
If every person will think of committing suicide like you.
Then the population will rise.
- Rise.
In Hell!
You will get hurt.
Yes, you are a very strong man.
Okay stop this fooling around.
From today you will not talk about dying.

Maybe I have seen you somewhere?
No... yes.
You are the one, you both {ought that night...
...and she jumped in front of my car.
Yes... yes.
But you said she is the daughter of your uncle's best friend.
Does that girl have a habit of committing suicide?
Yes, yes she had told me once.
That she will immerse herself in fire.
She had told me once too, that...
...she will drown herself in the pond.
And now she jumped in front of the car.
Seems like her mental condition is not stable.
So my intuition was right, she is mad isn't it.
You should not say like that.
Yes, this is also a kind of madness.
The person always keeps thinking about dying.
And in our language ii is called suicidal tendency.
I think she needs psychiatric help.
Just a minute, doctor, please come here. Hurry.
Have you see sir'?
He is taking the doctor to the side.
What is the meaning of taking doctor aside?
And I told her that you can become the heroine of our play.
You will also earn some money.
And even our problem will be solved.
Enough! That is all I know about her.
And she had even agreed to do it.
Doctor, she is regaining consciousness.
OK. Thanks.
Look, she has regained conscience.
If you want then you can go in and meet her.
Which place is this?
How did I come here?
Relax, relax.
Who are all these people?
You don't know them'!
You are working with them.
Looks like even she doesn't know english, like us.
Didn't you recognise us?
You work with us. 
In a drama.
With you.
I am the boss. Director.
What boss? 
Where is my husband?
Husband.
You are still not married, that...
...is why people were still after you.
You had an accident that is why we brought you here.
What nonsense are you talking, I don't know you all.
Please call my husband.
What husband?
Where does he stay?
Vikram Chauhan, he stays in Liverpool.
His number, 079 - 6420708.
What is this'?
Tears in your eyes.
What does he expect, lime juice.
Doctor sir, you did a very big favour on me.
You returned to me my lost wife.
How can I ever thank you'?
If you want to thank anyone then...
...thank them who saved your wife's life.
I don't know you people, but I would like to say...
...that whatever you did, I cannot forget that for my life.
Nisha and I were got married 2 years ago.
After marriage I found out that her...
...mental condition is not right.
She even tried to commit suicide once.
Then I took her to the hospital.
The doctors said that she has suicidal tendencies.
And for treatment, they will have to...
...keep her in the hospital for a few days.
Suddenly one day the doctor called from the hospital.
He said that she has disappeared from the hospital.
I lodged a police complaint.
Here is the medical report and the police complaint.
Because of you, my wife is safe.
I am very grateful to all of you.
You not only returned my wife, but you have...
...returned me my whole life.
Yes, now you can take her, she is well anyway.
But bring her back here after 1 week for check up.
Because in such cases, this can happen again.
Okay doctor sir.
For Nisha's treatment we will stay in London...
...in our friends guesthouse.
As soon as she is fine, we will go back our home in Liverpool.
If you need anything, then here is my card.
The doctor said that because of me...
...all of you had to face a lot of troubles.
Whatever I did, I did not do it purposely.
I did it because of my illness.
And if possible, then please forget it.
Who could it be, so late at night.
Hello.
- I am Nisha here.
Tell Bunty to save me!
What happened?
This man is not my husband.
Bunty is my husband.
Bunty is your husband.
But when did you get married?
You please call Bunty!
Please call Bunty!
Bunty, Bunty she has called again.
Who?
- Her phone, looks like she has...
...got an bout of craziness again.
Whom?
- To Munni, come, come.
She is crying on the phone.
Bunty, Bunty please come and take me from here.
I don't want to stay here.
Munni, what are you saying?
You are his wife Munni.
Are you coming or not?
Look, a can of petrol and a box of matches are lying here.
If you will not come then I will pour...
...he petrol on myself and kill myself.
You will not do anything like that.
Bunty if you will not come here in half an hour...
...then I will kill myself!
I promise that I will die.
Why are you talking like that?
Nisha! 
Open the door.
Nisha!
 Please!
Nisha!
Open the door.
Nisha!
 Open the door.
Nisha!
Nisha!
What is all this?
Their food.
Their food! First let them decide...
...whether they are going to perform tonight or not.
Then you can give them food, understand?
Otherwise who will pay the penalty, your father?
Their food!
Don't sleep, wake up!
The heroine that you had showed me there.
That was good.
The other heroine that you showed me this time.
Even that was good.
But now she is dead.
Now whatever had to happen has happened.
I don't care about that.
Now the show has to go on.
And if you do not perform the show.
Then you will do a show everyday in the jail here.
We have found a solution.
We will not enact this drama, we will...
...enact another drama in which there is no heroine.
I don't know anything.
Anyhow this show must go on, understand.
Shekhar, this time you will surely get the goods.
Please give me one chance.
Only one chance.
Last time the secret police caught our goods.
Yes boss.
This time nothing should go wrong.
- Yes boss.
Because I will be with you at the time of the deal.
- Yes, Boss.
To keep an eye on you.
- Yes, Boss.
And we will not make he deal in a lonely place.
- Yes, Boss.
We will do it in a public place.
- Yes, Boss.
So that no one suspects us.
- Yes boss.
Now, in London, where will we find Peacock feathers?
Let me look where we can find a Peacock. 
Aunty, please move.

Did you do it more'? 
Why are you panting like this?

 Where? - Further.
Come there, there.
Sir.
What did you do?
You fired a bullet'?
He is dead. 
- I didn't kill him, I didn't fire a bullet!
The gun is in your hand.
Did he die by himself?
If anyone sees us, then they will think...
...that we have committed this murder.
Not we. He has done it!
I have not done it understand!
I have not done it!
Hey quiet, quiet!
Now we only have to think to save ourselves.
Look, I did not shoot him.
You please don't say like that.
Until the show is not over, no one should see this dead body.
We will hide it somewhere.
And if anyone sees it after the show.
Then no one will suspect us.
Where will we hide ii, in our pockets?
Anywhere, lake him away from here.
It seems like we are very unlucky.
This is the way to go to the bathroom too. Hide him somewhere.
Lift him up. 
- Boss, help us.
Welcome. The chief guest of our today's program...

But whatever happened, the corpse vanished by itself, thank God.

But this is Bawla's chain!
This chain is mine, but the tunic is no! mine.
The tunic is his.
The tunic is mine but, I did not kill anyone.
Then why are there blood stains on the tunic?
He fired the bullet...
We all did it together.
Now they are accusing me.
I will explain what happened.
Commissioner sir.
Whatever you want to explain, do it in the police station.
Arrest them.
Oh God, what is all this happening?
I don't know anything myself.
Unnecessarily I welcomed him.
I should not have done the show.
Will you eat alone, share it with others too...
Let me eat it first, it is very hard.
Have you gone mad, this is a bomb!
Sir, run fast...
Come fast sir, don't sleep.
- Run! Run!
Where did that bomb come from?
I don't know.
That man ate it a little and threw at me.
I thought that it was custard apple.
Who was that'?
How would I know'?
Why are you asking me?
Then who should I ask?
Go and ask the one who threw that bomb.
Let us do one thing, let us go back to India.
How will we go?
The passport is with he police.
Okay tell me one thing, if we will start running...
...along the railway tracks.
Then what do you think, when will we reach India.
Tell me.
Do you have a daughter?
My sister has a daughter, 5 years old.
What do want tell me'?
When we will reach India, your sister's daughter's...
...granddaughter would be getting married.
Then we will have to buy a present for her.
Keep quiet! You always keep talking nonsense.
Look, the Lord always come to help in someway or the other.
This time he has come in the form of a bomb.
Then it must be Lord Shiva.
Hail Barn Bhole.
Yes, Bam Bhole.
Now we have to think, that how can...
...we prove ourselves innocent?
How? - That is what we have to think.
I am dead.
Go, and bring that rat to me.
Shut up, you rat.
You scoundrel, I will break your...
...arms and legs and hang in the museum today.
Where is that scoundrel?
Look, you don't beat me. 
Your...
- Oh!
After breaking your legs he has disappeared.
Careful. Otherwise I will be on hospital bed.
They have disappeared, or have you hid them.
You are trying to act smart.
Pick up his taxi.
How can we pick it up, it is very heavy.
Shall we all pick it up?
You fool, it has four tyres...
You can drive it.
Sir. Please have mercy on my taxi.
You smarty, until you will not bring them to me.
Your taxi will remain with me.
Go.
Hey what are you doing?
Wait!
Where are you taking my taxi, you scoundrels!
It is not my taxi, it is on rent!
My owner will kill me! 
Wait!
God, save me.
Come on, get up. 
Gel up!
Can I get some tea'?
Do you have money for the tea'?
I did not lake the safe along with me...
...when the police arrested me.
I don't have any money with me.

Come on, come on.
Take the paper along, it will be of use again.

Bunty son.
Bunty 
- What happened?
Our photo has been published In the papers.
Come, come.
You look so handsome in the picture.
If you have money, then buy it.
Read about my praises too along with yours.
What is written tell me.
The name of all three of us is written.
All our names are written.
But at least read what is written.
I have read it all, come to the side I will tell you.
What happened?
Keep your head down and walk.
What happened now?
Bunty, what happened?
Come on, fast.
What happened now?
It is written that we have killed famous...
"businessman Vikram Chauhan and ﬂed away.
There are more praises written about us.
It is written that our gang hurled...
...a bomb inside the police car and help us run away.
We have a gang, and we don't even know about it.
Yes, and the police commissioner...
...has given a shoot at sight order for us.
You wanted to become famous...

Come on.
We'll discuss this, okay?
Boss.
We are discussing a murder... sorry matter, please go.
Go, go.

And there is another bad news boss.
There was another man with them.
Who was he'?
He looked like to be their boss.
- Is it?
But boss, there is also a good news.
What?
They are not secret police, they are terrorists.
And they also have a big gang.
I found out all this from the T.V and the newspaper.
If you want to see?
The newspaper.
You fool, they are not terrorist they are secret police!
Didn't you see, they come with the police.
Didn't you see? 
They travel with the police...
...and that too not walking!
In the police car! 
Do you think that I am a fool.
This is all their trick, to fool us!
This is their new plan, so that we do something wrong.
And they catch us red handed.
Mannu-bhai Gandhi...
Mannu-bhai Gandhi here!
Kindly, I am sorry Sher Khan.
No, Sher Khan, there won't be any mistake this time. Promise.
No, this time I will come myself to give...
...you the delivery of the pouch.
Give me one more chance. 
Just one more chance.
Thank you very much.
What a plight we are in.
 - Here.
Have your last meal.
Why for the last time?
Because now I have very little money left.
If you people have some money left...
...then you can order something and eat it.
I don't have a single penny with me.
Then starve like beggars, until we...
...don't prove ourselves innocent.
How will we prove that we are innocent?
One minute. 
There is one way.
If we will go to Vikram's house.
Where Munni burnt herself...
She is already burnt to death.
And 'Imam is dead 'm me meme.
Then what will we do by going there? 
Mourn for both of them!
I and sir have seen Munni, that means she is alive.
Bull have not seen her, that means she is not alive.
And if I have not seen someone and he is there...
...I don't believe that.
Have you seen Japan? - No.
That means Japan is not there.
Look we have only two ways.
The first is that we can go to Vikram's house...
...and look for evidence, anything...
...anything that can prove that we are innocent.
And he second way.
There is no second way.
Give me a hand. Come, come.
Come sir.
- Come sir. Come.
Careful.
Careful.
Which language is this?

Sheetal is after all Sheetal!
Sheetal is not Aditi.
No, Aditi is Sheetal.

Nisha is Munni.
- Then who is Aditi?
Nisha.
Keep quiet! Keep quiet you all.
Sheetal, Nisha, Aditi whatever...

She is a very dangerous girl.
She changes her name just like she changes her clothes.
I am telling you, I will not spare her.
Tell this great person, that how...

Tell me one thing, who is Munni'?
- Nisha

What happened?
You are so smart. What
intelligence you have!
What happened?
This girl's name is Aditi.
And she is going to Mumbai.
What do we do now?
Are you happy now?
You are satisfied now?
I am saying, the girl who is dead, this guy is pulling her down.
Don't look, sister is coming here.
What did she say?
What's her name?
Is he deaf?
I am not deaf. 
I know.
She said her name is Aditi.
I say that her name is not Aditi.
It's Sheetal.
What is he saying?
Sir, in the morning when we had called the pub...
...they said there is only one Indian girl...
...and her name is Sheetal.
And when we asked that foreigner...
...he loo said that Sheetal is there.
And I can prove this.
- How?
How'?
Sheetal!
Idiots!
Look over there! Look over there!
From where did you get this money?
- I don't know.
You don't know!
You don't know!
But we do know!
Even if we died, still this miser...
...won't give money for our shroud.
You don't know! Aren't you ashamed!
For the past 2 days we have not eaten anything!
Aren't you ashamed!
I don't know anything about this money.
I am speaking the truth.
I don't know.
 I just saw the money.
Then from where did this money come?
Your father put it in your pocket!
Or it fell from the sky!
Look! Look!
 Now he is silent!
He can't speak anything now!
Tell him to talk properly.
I am his boss!
MY foot!
He has either committed robbery or he has stolen it.
What are you fighting like cheap guys!
I am hungry! 
We have got the money!
Let's eat something!
I don't want stolen money!
I won't eat food bought from this money!
- Thank you.
I gave work to everybody for so many years.
I fed everybody.
I considered them as my own people.
And this is what I get in return!
I am a thief, am I not'?
This is stolen money!
Yes!
I won't give you a drop of water with this stolen money.
Remember this!
Now there is no relation between us!
You have decided it now!
I decided it since my childhood.
Even if I am dying, I won't drink your water.
Because the person who will drink your water...
...he won't achieve salvation.
You are such a filthy man!
You snatch children's meal!
Aren't you ashamed!
Bawla, let's gel
Sir, look there!
Chaat Masala will add flavour to the food.
I have got it from Surat.
I ate the 'kahamanfi but the chaat remained.
I have 'mukhwaas'. Come on.
Listen! Do you have a knife?
Give that paper. - Here.
Some more cucumber.
Do you know how to eat this?
- No.
You should chop it into small pieces.
You should take the Masala.
And sprinkle over it.
After sprinkling it, mix it like this, and eat 1 piece.
Of cucumber... and keep it here.
Sir, give this poor guy something.
- No.
It is stolen money.
- So'!
If we bought anything from it, then it is not honest.
This decent guy won't like it.
You go in and pay.
Till then I will prepare the 'chaat masala'.
If we had black pepper, it would have been great!
I have got it!
You have black pepper?
- Yes.
Wow! Are you a man or cupboard?
The cupboard is full, but the brain is empty.
The one who is filled, he will eat.
Rich people don't lock horns with poor people.
You go.
- I won't argue.
Come my cucumber, see how I caught you...
who will eat the cucumber's spice...
that side, Indian!
What happened?
Why are the people running?
Nothing. A dog had gone mad.
That's why everybody is running after him.
Where is the boss'?
- Don't know.
He was preparing the 'chaat' here.
Boss... boss...
so you don't know me?
- No.
You have never seen me before?
- I told never before!
Then how did you take money from me?
What money!
He is very dangerous!
I have never seen such a liar and a deceiver like him!
He took money from me and he says he has never seen me!
He is not a police!
He is thief-police!
Thrash him and make him spill out that...
...what do secret police know about me!
- Yes, boss.
What do you know about our business?
You don't know what happens in your business?
Stop this rubbish!
And tell me the truth!
What do you know about Gandhi!
He is the father of our nation.
Stop kidding! And tell us the truth!
What do you know about Gandhi!
Forget me, the whole of India knows about him!
What will I say?
What!
What else do you know about him?
When he used to walk, the entire...
...country of India would walk with him.
And the ones who were with him, they had to run.
You are right. 
We have to run.
What do you know about his business?
Business?
 He used to spin the wheel.
Wheel? 
What wheel?
To make hand-looms, to fight for independence.
All these are Gandhi’s business.
Whom are you talking about?
What kind of an Indian are you?
You forgot mahatma Gandhi after staying in London?
Not mahatma Gandhi!
M.G. Gandhi!
What do you know about Mannu-bhai Gandhi?
Who are you?
Where did he go?
He has loads of money.
He must be having fun.
We are sitting here waiting for him, hungry and thirsty.
He must be having a 7-course meal in some 7 star hotel.
Boss, with a pillar.
I ripped out 2 of his teeth...
...2 of his nails and I damaged that loo.
Still he is not saying anything.
Very tough guy-
Now you will speak up.
I am losing my 'saans' breath, (mother-in-law).
Now you will lose your daughter-in-law loo.
Sir, there is a call for you.
Mannu-bhai Gandhi here.
“O, no, m, she: khan.
Listen to me.
Give me one chance.
Because this time some police officer...
...will send the courier to you.
Unnecessarily we are wasting our time.
From the 4 girls, not even one will come.
Bawla! 
Come here! Quickly!
What happened?
Come quickly! 
Look, she is going! Look!
She went inside.
Now she will come.
As soon as she comes, we have to follow her.
This is your ticket ma'am.
And here's your passport.
- Thank you. 
- Have a nice trip.
She has come!
-She has come!
Look! Hurry up!
Hurry up!
 Idiot.
And if now she doesn't give...
...the ticket to Nisha, then understand...
Your face is not nice, but at least talk nicely.
Come.
Go and catch her. Go, or she may run away.
Shall I tell you one thing?
Will you listen to me, brother?
Remove your brain, put it in pouch, and throw it away.
Bahia, this is not Aditi.
Have you ever known an English by the name of Aditi?
I will tell you.
We will follow this English woman.
Let us find whom she gives the ticket.
Amazing ideal
Sheetal gave her ticket to the English woman...
...the English woman gave to her Aunt.
Aunt gave it to her child, the child gave lo his uncle.
How many people will you follow?
Do you have a pouch?
Now what do you want? 
Tell me.
You beg alms on the train. 
Okay.
And don't eat my brains.
You go away from here, go.
Instead of begging, I will escape from this country in 3 days!
You think I don't have brains?
Nor they will hang me, nor put me in prison...
...nor I will fall in anyone's hand.
Neither will Bawla die like a homeless man.
Understand?
What happened?
- In the toilet!
I saw the corpse!
I saw the corpse alive!
I saw Nisha!
- Where? 
- In the bathroom.
Nisha! Come! 
Come! Come!
Look!
I saw her!
- She was here, isn't it'?
What are you doing? Run!
Hello! Guru, this is Gullu speaking!
The cab driver.
Yes, I know where is that scoundrel Bunty.
You quickly come to Brighton railway station.
And listen! Please bring my cab!
Is this boss speaking?
Scoundrel, your cab has been found...
...Quickly come to Brighton railway station.
Take your cab and get lost from here!
Once I return your cab, I will no longer be your slave.
Stop! Where are you running?
You act as dead?
And you make fools of us? Huh?
You killed your husband!
And you accused us!
I didn't murder anyone!
Is it'! 
Then did I kill him?
You are lying?
If you didn't, then why did you run away...
...from the theatre that day?
I had come to tell you the truth about myself.
Which truth did you come to tell?
- My name is not Munni.
That even I know, your name is...
Nor my name is Nisha, and nor is Vikram Chauhan my husband!
Nisha Chauhan!
Vikram Chauhan's real wife!
You are lying so much!
Aren't you ashamed!
You have been lying to me since the day I met you!
Look at your face!
You look so innocent!
But you are so cunning!
It's my mistake]
That I made you a part of my life and I fell in love with you!
I blame myself!
Why did I meet you'!
 Why did I fell in love with you'?
Bunty, please believe me.
I am speaking the truth.
How many truths will you speak?
Which one should I believe?
You will have to hear me out!
And you can do whatever you want after that.
My name is Aditi.
 Aditi Desai.
The man who had brought me here for work...
...his intention was bad.
The day he cast lustful eyes on me...
I ran away from there.
But I left my passport there.
I am lucky that I found my friend Sheetal.
She was working in a dance club.
She got me work in that dance club.
I worked thereto make both the ends meet.
Then one day the police arrived there.
Before they could ask for my passport...
...and ask questions, I ran away from there out of fear.
But the police followed me.
Just then a car's door opened.
The man who saved me from the police...
...he was Vikram Chauhan.
'Get in.'
'I wanted you to play the charade of my wife for a few days.'
'And you will do whatever I want.
Don't worry.'
'I won't touch you.'
'But after my work is done, I will give you a new passport...
...and 25 lakhs.'
'With that you can happily return lo India.'
'What if I refused?'
'Then nobody can save you from the police.'
'ls there anybody?'
I did not have any option.
I thought I will get a passport and loads of money...
...to return lo India back to my parents.
And I said yes to him.
Actually Vikram and I were together.
We were waiting for the doctor.
So that in front of him I would play the charade of suicide...
...and prove that I, meaning Vikram's wife...
...was mentally unstable.
But before that your car arrived there.
When the doctor came, I played the charade...
...of committing suicide in front of him...
but you saved me.
Then you asked me to work for your play.
I didn't tell you my name Munni.
And I told you a fable.
The night when Babla Heard me talking...
...to some one, that was Vikram.
He told me to behave in such a way with you all...
...that it would look as if I have suicidal tendencies.
So that your testimony will Prove to the doctor...
...thal I am mad.
After that everything happened as per the plan.
'I promise you that I will die!'
'The work is done.'
'As I had promised you, here is the remaining money.'
'After today, neither I know you, nor you know me.'
'Good luck.
- Thank you.'
When I left from there, I found that...
...I had left my passport inside.
I went back to collect it.
Vikram was taking a young girl inside...
...who was not in her senses.
And it was none else, but his real wife Nisha Chauhan.
'Stop! I won't let you do this! '
'What are you doing here?'
'I will kill you! 
But I won't let you do this! '
'You will ruin my hard work of so many years! '
You will spoil my plan?
- Nisha, he will kill you.
'Nisha run away, he will kill you.'
'Nisha, close the door!'
'Leave me, Vikram! '
'Nisha! 
Nisha, close the door! Leave me! '
'Nisha you run away.'
'Vikram! '
'First I will set her ablaze.
Then it's your turn.'
'Nisha, open the door! Nisha! '
'Nisha! Open the door!
Please, Nisha! 
Open the door!'
And then... he burnt his wife alive.
But I somehow ran Away from there.
I tried many times to tell you the truth,
...but for some or the other reason, I couldn't reach you.
Even if I believe you that you are speaking the truth...
...why did you kill Vikram'?
Bunty, I didn't kill Vikram.
Bunty, don't leave her.
I have called the commissioner, he is coming to catch her!
What have you done!
Bunty, he will kill me.
He will not beat you.
He will worship you.
Your papa is coming, you sinner!
Stop this rubbish!
You guys have done a grave mistake by calling him here.
Because...
- Why?
Because he has murdered Vikram!
Come out! Out!
Why did you bring Taneja sir along?
Keep quiet!
He has hired goons from India to break my legs!
No!
- What no!
Either pay my hospital bill or else present...
...those goons in front of me!
Who?
- Why are you asking?
I am at the 6th floor, come up.
Where? 
Upstairs? Upstairs.
Where are you taking me?
- Your legs, come!
That day when I came to the theatre to meet you both...
...at that time Vikram too was there.
'You are he sole witness of Nisha's death.'
'I can't keep you alive.'
Vikram!
He shot at Vikram.
And running in a wounded condition, he ran into you.
I was the sole witness of that murder.
He tried to kill me loo.
But somehow I saved my life and I ran away from there.
He even found out where I lived.
I couldn't come lo
you guys for help.
He had instigated you guys in the murder case.
I took my friend Sheetal's help.
For buying the ticket.
Before he kills ma, I want to return to India.
That is fine.
But I can't understand one thing.
Why will the police commissioner kill Vikram Chauhan?
Bunty, even I don't know that.
I will tell you.
Because Nisha was my only sister.
After our parent's death...
I raised her like my child.
One day she told me that she loves a guy.
And she wants to marry him.
That guy's name was Vikram Chauhan.
I never refused her.
I got them married.
A few months after marriage, my sister...
started losing her mental balance.
And one day I found out that she has burned herself to death.
When the post mortem report arrived...
...I found out that she was given drugs.
When I started investigating, I found out...
...thal to gel her wealth.
Vikram was giving her injections full of drugs.
And because of this my sister had grown weak.
Vikram was already married.
He married my sister to lay his hands on her wealth.
When I spoke to Vikram...
'It is possible that what you are saying that is true.'
'Now the wealth is mine.'
'By killing me, do you want lo get hanged...
...and leave your children orphaned?'
Since then I was searching for him.
And that day when I came to the theatre, I saw him.
I was lucky.
Unknowingly you all kept the corpse in the AC duct.
It slipped and fell on the stage.
I won't spare the girl.
She aided Vikram in killing my sister.
And not even you, who will be the witness to her murder.
Hang on! 
Listen to me! Hang on!
I understand your feelings.
This girl wants to say something in her justification.
Speak up!
 Are you dumb! Speak up!
The gun is in his hands! Speak up!
I am tired. 
Where are these Bunty and Bawla?
Where is he?
I saw him going upstairs.
Has he vanished in the thin air?
Do one thing.
You wait here, I will break his legs and come.
Nab him when he leaves from here.
What will happen to me'?
I am there.
So what! Move!
Move! Move!
l am there.
Babla! Bunty!
Guru!
Come
How old this must be'?
He is Sher Khan.
Yes, boss.
But he is neither carrying Bag nor money.
Maybe he has brought cheque or demand draft.
Go and ask him.
- Yes, boss.
Do you have demand draft?
- What?
Money! Money!
Is this your father's building that you are asking for money?
The money for the goods.
Pouch! Pouch!
Have you gone mad, asking for a “pouch”?
He has gone mad.
Are you Sher Khan?
Yes? 
- No, you need not worry.
Tell, are you really Sher Khan?
No, I am his father-in-law!
Oh my God!
We want to meet your son-in-law.
Where is your son-in-law'?
He died.
- When?
Just now.
He died a minute ago.
- How?
By eating a chocolate.
Why are you eating my brain!
Bunty is not here, who are these strange people?
Boss, these guys know where Bunty is!
He is my boss!
Gullu, save me from them!
Boss, they are addressing him as boss.
This means they all are secret police.
And they have nabbed Sher Khan.
Champak bhai, how come you are here?
- Nab him! 
Nab him!
Boss, the police have surrounded us from all sides! 
Run!
Here he is!

Very good.

I am sorry for whatever happened.
