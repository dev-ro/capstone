This is awful trash.
Yeah.
Perhaps we could
go out for a wee while?
Where would you be running to
at this time of night?
We could have a wee
drink in The Stoker.
Ugh! That place
is full of degenerates.
Elliott.
I think I have a --
It must be --
I don't know.
Same again, please,
Claire.
No.
What?
Thomas told me to cut you off
until you pay the account.
I'm one of
his best customers.
You have the biggest tab,
but a customer actually pays.
I'll get it.
No. You can't
buy another drink.
Shit's no different
than any other night is it?
Why would you put up
with this smug bastard?
Do you know,
I ask myself the same thing
every fucking day.
Sure, why don't you go back
to work for your da
if you've no money?Geez.
I'll just scrounge
off of you, mate.
What do you reckon,
Germans?
Germans would have more sense
than to come here
and look
at a pile of stones.
They're Canadians.
Canadians love
wearing maple leaves.
What will you have?
Just a couple of pints
of whatever is local, please.
You heading out
to the cairn?
Why? Are you going to tell us
to stay off the moors?
This Ireland lad,
there aren't any moors.
Now, I wouldn't go
traipsing out there alone.
Don't know which fields
there's no wicked bull in it.
Are there
any tour guides?
Oh, aye, sure.
We can take you.
It's in
his da's field.
How much?
And most people don't even know
Bram Stoker was Irish.
Or that he got
his inspiration here.
See, this land belonged
to an evil old whore
named Abhartach,
right?
And he would drained people's
blood and drank it like water.
Locals tried to kill him,
and he just kept rising
looking for the more.
Like Dracula? Fuck Dracula.
Folks round here
don't like that word.
Fuck?Dracula.
You literally have a painting
of him outside the bar.
We might as well get
something out of the fact
Stoker came here.
Pillaged our legend and used it.
To write the greatest
horror novel of all time?
Well, it's worth
a read, is it?
What, you haven't
actually read it?
But that Abhartach,
he was,
which is Gaelic for --Undead.
You've done
your homework anyway.
Yeah,
she loves this shit.
And what
you probably don't know
is that a Chieftan
called Cahan
stabbed the fucker
through the heart
and buried him
out here.
Someone from our time
killed the original vampire,
and we don't even
get the credit.
And since then, no-one's
had the balls to move his grave.
Some people say
that if you get too close,
you spontaneously
start to bleed.
Like he's sucking it out of you
just by being close.
Aye. Suck them
without sucking.
It doesn't prove shit.
Stoker came to Six Mile Hill,
heard this story.
A few years later,
releases Dracula.
Did he ever say he was actually
inspired by this story?
The story of Abhartach
is the first story
ever written down
about a blood-drinking creature.
And he's buried
under there.
It's a pile of rocks
in a field.
I've lived in that house
all my life.
My da owns this land,
and I am telling you
there is something
underneath those stones.
And if you get close enough,
you'll hear it.
Like we all did
when we were kids.
Aye.
Try it.
Fine.
Be careful, mate.
Go on.
Some things are older
than science,
older than God.
The Earth has
it's own secrets.
Jesus!
Christian!
That was some roaring
you were doing there, chief.
It's only
an old hand, huh?
You fucking pricks!Come on.
No point tramping
all the way out here
and not getting
a bit of a scare.
Haven't you guys
got anything better to do?
Nope.
No, we don't.
The man will never be
in her bed again.
Bet she dumps him before
they even get back on the plane.
That was a wild ream
of shite you gave them.
"Some things are
old than God."
I'd love to know if there's
actually anything under there.
We'll find out
soon enough
if this bypass goes ahead
and rips through these fields.
Cut off at The Stoker
again, huh?
He'll never learn.Probably not.
Go away!
Hey!
Told you about staying
in that bar all night.
I wasn't in the bar.
That's the only mixer
I can spare.
Cheers.
I've a bunch of broken slat
and pit walls in the shed.
I might get a few.
And I might start
rearing kangaroos.
Why don't you sell
this old place on?
Ma wouldn't have
wanted it so.
Aye, and she wouldn't
want to see you buried
when the whole fucking thing
tumbles in around you.
The bones are
solid, da.
Why don't you come in for a cup
of tea, and I'll show you?
Nah. I've too much on.
Are you busy
otherwise?
Taking away.
I have a job
if you want it.
We're doing the groundwork
on the new bypass.
You're joking?
I'm not.
People in town
are going to go mental.
About an old pile
of stones?
Any one of them
can come and see me.
Da, you're putting William
and his parents off their land.
I was thinking that...
you could run the job.
Tell them your name is
on the side of that van.
I'm alright.
Grand. Then you pay me
full rent for this mixer.
Give me a lift.
Get up in the fucking back.
You a farmer now?
Oh, we've been
ringing you all morning.
Was there
a match today?
You're away, man.
You said you'd give me
a wee lift home,
or did you forget that,
as well?
What's that
in your hand?
Don't worry about
what's in my hand.
We thought
you were dead.
Yeah. So,
who stood in for me?
You probably needed two men
in fairness.
S.P.
He can hardly run
the length of himself.
Sure, neither can you.
S.P. is actually not
a bad player.
Well, did he score?
No. Nobody scored
except your man here.
15 points.
Oh, 15 points.
That's impressive.
How's it feel to go out
with the wee king?
Yeah, makes me feel like
a queen, so it does.
Oh, fuck away off,
the pair of you.
It does!
It does!
Your da need
any help around he farm?
I don't think so.
Why?
I heard his bull keeps
breaking out.
I could throw up a few fences
for him if he wants.
Oh, who died?
Oh, for fuck sake.
Have I made
that joke before?
Maybe once
or twice Eugene, eh?
Well, there is something
that I heard.
It's about your da
being an undertaker.
God forgive you.
Oh. What
was the score?
Oh, we fucking
hammered them, George.
-Yeah, I was there.
-He's a bullshitter, George.
Sure, we all know that.You're working
on a Saturday?
Have to.
My solicitors aren't cheap.
And the bypass
has us ruined.
-And when do you have to be out?
-Two months.
Well, you know,
room at my place
if you need somewhere
temporary.
Oh, that house
is livable is it, eh?
Don't I fucking live
in it?
Here, George. You know
the body and shit like that.
Found more weird shit
under the ground in me shed.
How old do you reckon
that is?
Frigging Hamlet
in a transit?
What's a Hamlet?
Oh, I -- I'm away in to help
your ma with packing.
The poor woman
is probably demented.
I don't know.
People are usually in better
shape when they get to me.
-Worth anything?
-I doubt it.
I'm sure there are
plenty of dead things
in the ground around here
if you want them.
See you.
Will you be
in The Stoker later?
I'll see you there.
I want to chat to you
about something.
Aah! Ohh!
Fuck are you at?
Da, I'm having
a shower!
I know you're
having a shower,
but why are you
having it here?
There's still no hot water
at my place.
It's your disaster, cub.
What's this dirty old head
doing on my kitchen table?
I found it in the ground
under the shed.
It might sound stupid,
but do reckon ma's place
is built on some kind
of historical site?
Geez, you know what the people
are like in this town.
Everybody's ground
is on a historical site.
I was thinking I could call
a archaeologist or something.
Maybe they'll
pay me to dig.
Is that your
big plan, is it?
It's a human head.
Somebody's bound
to be interested
in finding out
who it belongs to.
It probably belongs
to some pervert like you
who had no work
and starved to death.
That house has been in your
mother's family for generations.
And she didn't leave it to you
so you could tear it apart.
Go out digging for skulls
and fuck knows what else.
You need some
direction, Cope.
What was the score?
Oh, hammered them.
William scored 15 points.
Aye. Is that as good
as I used to have?
Aye.
Mm-hmm.
How'd you play?
Me? Grand.
Did alright. Right.
Take it easy
on the sauce tonight.
Got mass
in the morning.
Aye.
Just going for one.
Hey!Hey!
You're a wee shott.I'm leaving, Eugene.
The fuck you mean
you're leaving us?
Oh, aye.
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving
Six Mile Hill.
Eh? Where you going?
Australia.
What you
going to do there?
They build roads and houses
there, too, you know?
Big sharks who eat
the balls off you, too, though.
I cannot swim.Can you not?
Well, if you're
going to Australia --
Shh!I need a new gig.
Thomas is
doing my head in.
I'm going to end up choking him
on a shot glass.
What are yous
talking about?
He's getting off
about Francie.
Of course he is.
Ah, the old boy.
Couldn't fucking
listen to him.
I'm just waiting
for the right time.
Are you alright
to get home.
Aye. I'll take, uh,
the short cut
through the field
there, sure.
Oh, have you
a torch?
No. And there's no need.
Seriously.
Come on.
See if I have one in the van.
Why don't you
come with me?
They wouldn't give a visa
to a boy like me.
I told you you should have
went to university.
Yeah, sure.
If only I had your brains.
Get you
out this shit hole.
Oh, come on.
It's alright.
You only like it here
because it's easy.
Well, it's not easy
dragging you through this field,
that's for sure.
And you think that this
where you're supposed to be
because you've never bothered
looking anywhere else.
Well, aye, looking at Australia
is well original.
But I suppose you'll fit in
with all the other wankers
who think they're
too good for home.
Hey, stop being a card
and tell Claire, or I will.
Oh!
Are you serious?Fucking --
This again?
This again?
Every fucking time
you get drunk, man.
You really need
to stay off those shots.
Fucking bastard!
Jesus, man.
Sorry, man.
So you should be.
Fucking stones
are still sharp enough.
Are you okay?
Aye.
Stings.
Get out of that field!
Get the fuck!
He's saying he wants
to take the body home.
What?
Is that
even fucking legal?
I don't think we'll be bringing
up another undertaker anyway.
Receive the Lord's blessing.
The Lord bless you
and watch over you.
The Lord make his face
to shine upon you.
It'll be alright, pet.
I'm sorry...
for your trouble.
Two pints of stout
there, Thomas.
Find someone else
to drink, chief.
What are the fuck
are you talking about, Thomas?
Give us
a pair of pints.
You Moffats are nothing
but trouble.
Not only did you get
William killed,
but you're doing the job
that is going to ruin this town.
The two of you should
never have been in that field.
I heard you was even going to
toss the cairn.
It's one of the only
fucking reasons
people come to this town.
You're not welcome
here anymore.
Let's go.
That's grand.
Many a man had a drink with me,
but you didn't.
Nah, you know what?
I wouldn't drink the piss
in here, anyway.
Better off drinking
me own fucking piss.
I'll never darken that prick's
door again. You know that?
Fucking yuppie cunt.
Just where did you get
this yob from?
Found it outside
me ma's house.
Do you reckon
it's a man or a woman?
Yeah, sure.
How could you tell?
Well they say you can tell
by the skull size.
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry meself
about them pricks
up the road, man.
They're making a mountain
out of a molehill.
Come on S.P.
William's dead, man.
It's not your fault
George Bogue can't handle
his beast.
Maybe I should go away.
I wouldn't bother
be bollocks.
I've been out there,
and there's nothing there.
I still ended up
in this kip.
Sure, where
would you even go?
I don't know.
Somewhere I could
get a fresh start.
You need money
for that carry-on, chief.
And unless you've got some job
I don't know about...
Did you put fucking diesel
in that thing
like I told you to?I was going to do it
tonight.
It's not doing any good
Claire sitting there stalled.
This is day 1,
Eugene.
We have 10 machines
and 30 men
on this site
this time next week.
It needs to be ready.
And get that pile
of stones tossed.
Sorry for
dropping you in it,
but you know he is
right, Eugene.
Like, why didn't you put
any fucking diesel
in the fucking thing?
You know, this is day 1.
You ought to smarten up, cub.
You're funny.
And more than that,
you poached
me old dumper.
Back to work.
George.
Eugene.
How you doing?
Oh...struggling on.
How long you know
your da was doing this job?
There was nothing
we could do, man.
The government ruled
on the bypass.
Did you know the night
William was killed?
Were you keeping it
a secret then?
Look,
I'm leaving soon.
You won't have to
see me anymore.
Oh, maybe Pauline
and I will do that.
You know, next week, when we're
thrown out of our house.
Get a flat in the city.
Start over.
No kids or grandkids
holding us back.
What do you want
me to say, George?
What did you see here
that night?
Nothing.
I'm going to
give you some advice
since I've known you
since you were a wee boy.
Don't toss
this cairn, Eugene.
You're not fucking cut out
for all this.
Gabriel,
let's tear it down.
Not a chance, cub.What?
I'm not going to
be responsible.
About what?
Where's the cheeky old vampire?
You actually mental?
Eugene!
What's the hold up here?
No hold up.
Go and put these
in that dumper, you.
You give him
a hand.
I'm actually a bit disappointed
some fucker didn't jump out
and try and bite
our necks.
You know what people
in Six Mile Hill are like.
They're going to be pissed off
about us tossing the cairn.
And the plant's so old,
I don't think anyone would want
to steal it,
but you never know.
They'll not
get past me.
Here.
Will keep you warm.
Thanks, Eugene.
Sure, we all just need
a hand up now and again.
Enjoy it.
So what will you do
when you leave?
Oh. Just hold on.
Have you told Francie
you're leaving?
Are you mental?
I just can't see you
in Australia.
But, William -- William
I could see in Australia.
Eugene, come on.
I knew all about
his plans.
I don't blame you
for what happened to him.
Oh, God, you're ma
was so good-looking.
Did you ever --
Did you ever figure out if --
Whether
she meant to do it?
Aye.
I don't know.
None of us do.
I know how it feels...
kind of.
How old
were you again?
7. Fuck.
I still remember it, though.
Stupid fucking thing.
He was cutting sticks
with a chain saw
that he didn't know
how to use, and...
Oh, there was so much blood.
I-I couldn't stop it.
And...by the time
I got back with a neighbor,
um, h-he was gone.
It's hard?
Aye.
How did Francie
tell of it all?
I don't know.
We haven't talked about her
since the day and hour she died.
Hello?
Hello?
If you're here to protest,
come back in the morning
and speak with Francie.
If you have the balls.
You hear me?!
Did you not tell Charlie to get
them gates open first thing?
I did.
Then why in Jesus' name
are they not open?
Anymore, I don't have
the energy.
Come on!
Right the fuck!
Did you take
much soup last night?
Aye, just a couple.
So did you and Claire...
you know?
Fuck away off.
Eugene, I need to go
and see the client.
Are you happy enough
to run the site?
Aye, cool.
I guess I'm in charge.
You're sacked.
Eugene! Come
and look at this!
Someone here
is having a laugh.
You think
it was Charlie?
Charlie!
He's not here.
Just...
get to work.
Find him passed out
somewhere.
I'll find him.
Charlie?!
Charlie?!
The fucking bastard.
What's going on here,
Eugene?
Were you guys using buckets
and spades all fucking day?
Did you build
that cairn back up?
No.
Well, who did?
That mad drunk you hired
to watch the place?
It could have been
anyone from town da,
but I reckon we
should just leave it.
I've figured out a way
we can bypass it
if we just
shift everything.
You're
an engineer now?
You know, two months ago,
you were a farmer.
Well, you put me
in charge.
Now we're
three days behind.
Look, I'm
just trying to help.
If you don't want me to, fine.
I don't have to be here.
You got somewhere else
you want to be at?
Maybe.
Very good.
Take Charlie home.
I might pull in
a bit of overtime
to get this job
back on track.
Charlie's
not here, man.
How are you doing,
Charlie?
Dead on, Francie.
And, so, your tracking him down
has taken all blasting day.
Jesus!
Charlie, what happened?
I-I-I don't know.
You were probably loaded
and fell.
Eugene, get him off my site
and get him checked out.
He's a death trap.
I'll run
this job myself.
What the hell
happened, Charlie?
Something turned
in the evening, Eugene.
Jesus! Oh, fuck!
Francie, what happened?
Has he made shite
of the van?
Eugene, you okay?
Check his head there.
Francie?
You made shit
with the fucking van!
That drive shaft's
banjaxed.
That wee fucker
tried to bite me.
Okay. Let's just
get off the site.
You've a job three days behind,
you've wrecked the van,
now you want to leave
the site sitting wide open.
Why don't we just
do ourselves a favor
and drive the whole thing
into the fucking lake.
There's something really,
really wrong with him, Da.
Something even more wrong?
It keeps busting my good lamps!
Fuck.
Charlie?
Charlie?!
If you bust now,
then I swear to Christ
I will take into you
like a good day's work!
Jesus. Gabriel!
Is that Charlie?
Did you see
how fast he moved?
I've never seen
anything like that.
Hang on. When you said
he tried to bite you?
Aye.Like a -- Like a --
Like a...
Like a cunt.
You come with me
and bring something to swing.
You stay here and get
that dumper started.
I want to help!Don't argue, Eugene.
This is serious.
I'm in charge here.
Gabriel!
We're coming, lad!
Keys?
On the table.
Charlie?
Fuck. Fucking light.
I know
they're over here.
S.P. is always
fucking moving shit.
Fucking S.P.
Fuck me!
Fuck off me,
you bastard!
Why is he damaging the
fucking lights, do you think?
You know how pricey
them bulbs are?
Oh, sweet Christ.
It's a lump
of hard hat.
You shit!
Fuck.
Yeah.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Did you get
the dumper started?
We're dealing with serious
crack here, son.
We found Charlie.Where is the fucker?
Stone dead.
What?!
Jesus!
Is that my new pole?
Fucking sick
of this monster shit!
Don't just stand there
looking at me! Come on!
That is disgusting.
Uh-huh.Maybe he was on drugs.
I took the coke once.
Got into six different scraps,
didn't feel a thing.
That doesn't look
like drugs.
What if it's
the cairn?
Like we -- we found it built up
exactly the way it was
and then Charlie doesn't show up
until night and attacks us.
Aye, but if that
was the problem,
wouldn't he have burned up
when the pole
went through his heart?
Yeah. Wouldn't he have
some fangs or some shit?
Maybe he was gonna
grow some.Wake up, Eugene.
He's not got no fangs.
That bastard's
just full drunk.
Oh, come on. Like, what are we
supposed to do about this?
We might need
holy water.
What is water supposed
to do about this?!
Where's she going?
Or maybe give him
back his heart, S.P.
Throw it in.
Oh, fuck!
That's the best yet.
Da?!
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!
You never know
what to do.
That's the job there.
Good job, Claire.
That'll put an end
to the fucking mischief.
Da. S.P.
Sweet Christ on the cross,
what is it gonna take?
Stones, Claire!
We need more weight!
Fucking bastard.
This is going to take
some explaining.
We'll tell the cops our security
guard was high on drugs,
and we buried him after
he killed our digger driver
with a hard hat.
Do you think
they'll buy it?
Eh, "He turned into
a vampire,"
doesn't kind of
sound right, does it?
There's nothing
about this tells me
we're dealing with
a vampire.
I see him stay alive for
a couple of minutes after you --
Da, we're not dealing
with two fucking dead hens here!
Look, we all love
to take the piss
out of tourists
for coming here, yeah?
But the night William died,
I saw something weird.
His blood was getting
sucked down
into the earth
under the cairn
like there was something
under there drinking it.
Maybe it was
Abhartach drinking it.
Maybe he's still alive
down there in the fucking dirt.
So, what? The stones were just
there to hold him down?
You mean the stones
you just moved?
Fuck!
Whose
foot's that?
Fuck this!
I'm out!
Get out
of the fucking road!
-Get in here!
-What the fuck is going on?!
We'll explain in a minute,
George!
You the keys
to this door handy?
Fucking spinning.
There's a vampire on my site,
and the whore's
is headed this way!
Have you boys been
sniffing diesel fumes?
Charlie and Gabriel
are dead, George.
I'm calling
the police.
What did I say about
the keys, George?!
All these people
are gonna have to jam this door.
Come on, S.P.!
Hey.
How are you doing,
Pauline?
What happened to her?
What do you think?
She got worse after the funeral.
Look, I know
this sounds mental,
but we might have let Abhartach
out of the ground.
Shut up, Eugene!
Don't you think
we've had enough to deal with?
It isn't coming yet.
Aye. Maybe your vampire
stayed in the dirt.
Or maybe
he's gone to town.
What? For a pint
in The Stoker?
Right.
Eugene, we need a plan.
Six Mile Hill.
Al...
it's Eugene Moffat.
What's the crack,
lad?
Uh, not much just...
I need to report something.
You should
really ring 999 first,
but anyway go ahead.
What do I say?
Let me talk to him.
I saw somebody hanging
about the town earlier.
You're right to call in.
What were they doing?
Being kind of creepy
and suspicious.
Probably worth
checking it out.
Where did you see this from?
The front window of The Stoker?
I'm barred
from The Stoker.
Ah. So, what did this person
look like?
Uh, he was tall with...
dark skin.
That's not a crime,
Eugene.
We are a welcoming
community, and --
Just go out and take a look
around the town, okay?
Promise me.
I suppose I could
go stretch my legs.
He's fucking useless.
We need to check this ourselves.
George, can I have
the keys to your Jeep?
Absolutely not.
I'll drive her.
Thanks, George.
All the best.
S.P., fuck off.
Fucking useless
calling the police.
Shotgun!Fucking S.P.!
Never learn.
Go straight to your parents
house, Francie, please.
Shit.
Where are you going?What'd he forget?
See, that's the same.
Charlie's drink?
When is that cub ever gonna get
himself sorted?
Jesus Christ.
George?
What's going on,
Eugene?
The dirty bastard.
Do you reckon that's
for the barbecue or something?
You steal my Jeep, and I still
can't get rid of you.
And why is there
a bottle of Charlie's
cheap sauce
in your Jeep?
Now, you'd be too highfalutin
to drink it, wouldn't you?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I've had enough
of this shit.
Look, you're gonna answer
the fucking question
or I'm going to --
Hold on, George.
Hold on.
I'm not going to
let you hurt me.
Maybe just calm down,
George, okay?
I know we've all wanted
to shoot Francie
at one point or another,
but now -- now is not the time.
I'll give you
a choice, Eugene.
You can turn around
and walk away...
or you can stay
and find out the truth.
You'll not
be the same again.
I doubt we'll be
the same again anyhow, George.
What's one more bit
of old madness, huh?
I'm asking Eugene.
I want to know.
Do you remember
the good room?
The good room?
Me and William were
never allowed in there.
Well, you can
go in now.
Da.
Well?
Any crack?
William's down there.
How about
a cup of tea?
The fuck you doing?
Well, is it sore?
Of course it's sore.
It was neck surgery.
Well, you zigged when you
should've zagged.
Aye, you try to play on our team
without William Bogue.
See how well you do.
And you think you're
supposed to be mixing that
with the medication?
Doctors are assholes.
What are you
looking at, mate?
Hey, pervert.
Me and her are just friends.
You're not going
to see anything.
What?
My stitches
just popped.
You're proper stoned.
Brian?
Brian, get up.
Brian?
Brian, get up.
Brian, get up!
I'm not sure
where to start.
Maybe with
a biscuit or two.
Fuck off, S.P.
What happened
after he died?
I wanted to prepare him
for burial myself.
Please.
Please just hand this job
to someone else.
I don't want
anyone else doing this.
Please! Please! Please!
Please! Please!
Please! Please!
Please!
Oh, please!
No!
Jesus, it must
have been some shock.
No, it was no big
fucking deal, Francie.
And what happened next George?
He was weak...so I locked him
in the good room.
He was hungry,
so I gave him meat.
It wasn't enough.
I knew what he wanted.
Dad! Dad! Dad!
I wanted
to put an end to it.
But I couldn't.
Is it an infection?
It comes up through the grave
and into the stones somehow.
I pulled a piece of it
out of William's hand.
This isn't Dracula.
People don't get turned
from a fucking bite.
They get turned by the stones
from Abhartach's grave.
I don't know.
It's all a bit fucking mad.
It's my fault.
Obviously, we couldn't
move house anymore
with a fucking vampire son
locked in the good room.
I had to put a stop
to the road.
I infected Charlie with a stone
from the cairn.
If Charlie attacked the site,
work would be shut down.
That's all I could think of.
Jesus Christ, George,
I've known you for 20 years,
and you were
going to kill me?
That's all you're going
to take from the story?
I am sort of
offended meself.
I haven't even known
you that long.
What would you do
if it was your son?
Jesus,
I'd have him put down.
Cheers, Francie.
That's not your son,
though, George.
William was a good person.
He was happy.
Aye, that's true.
He was a loyal sort of boy.
The kind you could always count
on him to give you
a wee kick in the ass
if you weren't doing your best.
Aye, he never tried to weasel
out of a round.
Fuck knows if that thing
would even buy you a pint.
He'd always use good manners
when he was over at ours.
And that's it?
What?
That's all you
remember about him?
Well, what
do you want?
The cub had good
fucking manners.
H-He'd a great right foot.
Probably the best right foot any
man ever had in Six Mile Hill.
You were awful
good friends to him.
I miss having yous
about the place.
Sure. I suppose
we're here now.
Uh, yeah.
This is lovely.
Fuck up, S.P.
He can't stay like this, George.
You know that, right?
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.
I don't know.
You're alright, junior.
Y-You're alright.
You're alright.
You're alright, junior.
You're dead on.
Good man.
Give me that
fucking thing there.Eugene: Jesus, da!
We need to leave.
How do you work
this fucking thing?
Wait.
Help me.
I want me balls.
Please help me finish this...
for William.
Oh, fuck.
I'll help you.
Aye, me, too.
I moved to the wrong
fucking town.
What, uh --
What are we doing?
We need
better weapons.
Sure, you'll kill fuck all
with this shite.
What about sunlight.
I mean, that is the number-one
vampire killer, surely.
Are there any ideas
in there?
The problem with
this book is it's fiction.
What's in there
and what's out there is reality.
And the reality is
you can't kill these things.
A stake through the heart
will weaken them,
but to really stop them,
you have to bury them
under the earth
and pile
the grave with stones.
That's a load
of old shit.
What about
decapitation?
What?
He's hardly gonna grow
a new fucking head, is he?
No, like, he's right.
He's right.
Aye, and if it works
on William,
it might fucking work
on Abhartach.
Aye.
How do we do it?
I'm definitely not going into
that room near that man.
What sort of tools
have you got, George?
You're doing nothing.
Come on, like.
What are you doing?Security.
No Abhartach?
Fuck him.
What did you call
your man that buried Abhartach
the first time?
Cahan.
Well, he was able to put
our friend in the ground,
and he didn't even
have electricity.
And what if he thinks
Cahan's still alive?
He'd want to be
a pretty stupid fucking vampire,
now wouldn't he?
Well, maybe he'll tear
the town apart
looking for someone
who isn't there.
So, everything
is still quiet, like?
Nothing strange
going on?
I'm serious Eugene.
If you call me again,
I'm going to
plant drugs on you
and throw you
to the mercy of the court.
Wanker.
Is it solid
down there then?
Solid as a rock.Are you sure now?
because I don't want this here
coming through the side
and taking a bedroom
to me.
Geez, he'd be doing us
all a favor.
For fuck's sake.
We need someone
to throw him out.
I can do that.
No, da.
What is William going to care
if you're there?
Be quick, alright?
Be careful.
Well, ballbag,
you're looking well.
You want to come out
for a bit?
Yeah?
Well, if you want to do
some killing, here I am.
The fuck's going on?
It was my fault, man.
Everybody knows it.
What are you doing,
Claire?
Just trust me.
Come to me, pet.
No! No!
Fucking go!
Goodbye, son.
Oh, fuck.
The fucker got me.
Oh, Christ, S.P.!
I'm done. I'm done.
I'm done. I'm done.
No. No. No.
You're fine.
Don't get all fucking melancholy
on me now, will you?
I had a good enough
ol' run.
I got to fight some vampires.
Not many men can say that.
I'm sorry, S.P.It's not your fault.
You're a wild man
for taking the blame.
You know that?
Tell me da he was right,
will you?
About what, lad?
He always said
I had no ambition
and would probably die
in front of the telly
with a can of beer
in me hand.
Fuck it.
At least it's not
a heart attack.
No.
How much more are
we supposed to take?
I mean, this is insane.
One mate dead in here,
and the other down there
nailed into
a fucking coffin.
And the town's
probably dead by now,
and it's all my fucking fault.
Seriously, what is the point
of any of this?!
This is shit, alright?
I don't want to
listen to crap like this.
He was just trying, cub,
and you're fucking whining
and about
to give up on him.
The job's not finished yet,
alright?
Oh, Christ.
I'm sorry
about everything.
The fuck?
Elliot.
I think I have a --
I'll the go get the keys
to the dumper.
Mom!
No, she's breathing.
Check on James.
Mom.
There's a few people
like this in the same shape.
And Brian McCauley's
lying face down in the gutter,
blood flowing
into the sewers.
Aye, but why are
we not bleeding?
He probably needs
to be close.
Like he's been going
through the town,
and the blood's
following him.
Aye, but where is he?
Maybe there's some
sort of an old lair
where this is
all flowing to.
Uh, that'd be paved over
a long time ago.
He killed a lot of people,
so maybe there are remains --
bodies, bones.
Shite.
What?
I know where it is.
I'm staying with them.
Claire,
we'll be back shortly.
This'll hopefully
not be a big job.
Come on, Francie.
Where the fuck are we going?
Eugene?!
Eugene --
I'm going to
Ma's house.
That was his lair.
That's why there were so many
bones in the ground.
What?
He's draining blood out
of people in the town somehow
and I bet you
it's going there.
Why?
Because he's hungry,
and he's pissed off.
If I'd been in
the ground that long,
I'd just want to sit
in the house and drink, as well.
Of course you would.
Aye, well,
the only difference is
if Abhartach binges
all night,
the whole town's
gonna be dead as fuck.
Come on.
Fuck this.
Da.
Door.
Right fucking mad.
I don't think
he's here.
What about up there?
Are you close?
That's what it is.
We're too close.
Okay. Mom, get up.
Okay. James,
I'll come back for you.
I can't promise that I will,
but I promise I'll try.
Come on. That's it.
Come on.
She was some character.
Aye, she was.
I miss her...
every day.
Me, too, Da.
I just want to stop
being angry at her.
Just remember
the good times.
You're 100% right.
Mom's maiden name.
O'Cain.
Cahan.
She always said
she had chieftain blood.
I suppose that means
you do, as well.
What the fuck
are you at?
I thought you were
giving me a hug.
What, are you
5 years of age?
Your arm's bleeding.
Come here.
A fucking hug.
Shit.
Da, he's close.
Aye, and he's
gonna be looking for you.
'Cause I suppose you're
the big chieftain now.
What?
That's as much
as it's gonna affect you?
I'm made of fucking harder stuff
than most, cub.
-What the fuck was that?
-Aah!
Hey, boy.
Thanks bit of fuck.
Wake up. Wake up!
Come on.
You're alright.
What happened?You fainted.
My jaw's
fucking killing me.
Must have hit it on the ground
when you fainted.
Did you punch me?
It really feels
like you punched me.
Why in the name of Jesus
would I punch you?
No, it's over.
I got the fucker.
Aah! You dirty
damping bastard!
Da!
Da, can you walk?I can hobble!
Good enough.
Oh no.
Ah! Fuck!
Get off me!
Fuck!
How's the leg?
Come on.
Look. Come on.
We need to get him into the sun.
Come on, Da.
Just get back, Da.
Just get back, Da.
Aah, fuck!
Da!
Fuck!
Da, could you not
see the hole?!
Come on.
Aah!
Bloody hell.
I've got to try.
Come on. Come on.
Shh, Francie.
Shh.
Burn, you bastard.
Oh, shite.
Sunlight doesn't work,
either.
George was right,
we just can't kill this cunt.
Look, we'll bury
the bastard here
and put him back
in the ground.
It's the only thing
that'll work.
Don't do this.
Fuck.
Francie. Francie!
I'm not leaving you here,
just helped me think.
I just need a fucking weapon,
something to weaken him.
What about that?
No way.
It's only in that leg.
It's fucked anyway.
I'm sorry, Da!
Da! Da! Da!
Francie.
Come on, Da.
Fuck.
Cheers, Francie.
How's it going?
Dracula?
Oh, aye, I read it.
It turns out sunlight
can't actually kill him.
No?
It was invented
by some German director
like 20 years
after the book was written,
I guess you learn
something new every day.
Aye.
Glad to see you're filling
your days productively anyway.
Claire, this is important shit
for me to know.
It is?
One more for the road?
My taxi will be here
in a minute.
Well, you'll have
a great time.
Show the others
how it's done.
Oh, I will.
Sure, I'll be back
in a year.
You can come see
the house then.
Aye?
It's totally
livable now.
Brand-new kitchen,
the like.
I'll even cook you dinner
or something.
Definitely, yeah.
Try to avoid all those
poisonous snakes and spiders,
and I'll come back home.
Get taken out
by your fucking cooking.
Hilarious.
Yeah.
Good bye, Eugene.
Hey, good luck,
Claire.
That's the new
living room done.
You did a good job
on the wiring.
I don't know how the fuck
what where you hung
that hall door, though.
I fixed it anyway.Ah, cheers, Da.
I left you a bit of stone
from that fireplace.
Your granddad
must have put that in.
So, what else
has to be done?
Just take it easy.
Come on.
Peg leg, Eugene.
I'm not fucking dead.
Anyway, plenty of time
left in the day yet.
Seriously, Da? Just go
and enjoy your weekend.
Will I see you
at the match tomorrow?
Aye, might
take a run down.
She'll be happy,
the luck you have in the place.
Aye, she would.
See you later, cub.
See you, Francie.
