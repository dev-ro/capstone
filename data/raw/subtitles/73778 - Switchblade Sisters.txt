[ Man ] Computer says

This the set?
Wait. Listen.
I'm expecting
my child support any day now.
Can't you give me
one more week?
Look, you don't talk
to me about it, lady.
The computer says repossess,
I repossess.
Unless you got 40 bucks
in cash.
That's all I have
f or f ood f or the whole week.
I sympathize.
I really do.
Wait. Oh, please.
No, I don't think so.
All right, all right.
I'll pay you. Just leave that here.
T ake it.
And I hope you roast in hell.
Thank you.

Well, you know,

You what?
Uh, it's okay. Leave him alone.
The Debs are payin'.
Lace, if the Debs are payin',

Aw, she's hungry.
- Look, guys. I caught a piggy.
- Ow!
What'd I do, Lace?
- Squeal!
- Oink.

[ Lace ]
Oh, is Donut a piggy?
Y es, Jesus, I'm a piggy!
Now you're gettin' nothin'.
You understand?
You're gonna sit there and watch the
rest of us eat until we're finished.
Let's sit down.

She's not worth it.
Give me some water.
Give me some water!
Quick!
It's a dirty trick
you pulled on Patch.
You're pretty good.
What else can you do?
Wanna find out?
Why so hostile?
These are the Silver Daggers,
and we are the Dagger Debs.
What gang you with?
- I ain't with a gang.
- You ain't with a gang,
people just stomp on you,
you don't have any muscle behind you.
Everybody's gotta be
in a gang.
Just ain't healthy
to lone it.
Thanks. I'll take my chances.
[ Sirens Approaching ]
- Hey, what do they want?
- Us, damn it.
Freeze, chippie.
Hold it right there, sweetheart.
You sure you want

They're juveniles.
They'll be out in a couple of days.
I'm damn sure I want

You throw

You ain't goin' nowhere.
Get your hands off

No, really.
Sure. Move it out.
I want my lawyer.
Okay, cut the smart talk.
You know the story.
We all gotta go through
the motions.
But one of these days, honey,
you and your gang's gonna make
a real mistake, and then I'm gonna--
Gangs? I don't know
anything about gangs.
Hey, you guys,

- Gangs? No.
- There are no gangs around here.
Y eah? Well, what's this?
A birthmark.
Everybody, up.
I'm only gonna

Somebody copped a bottle
of stimulants...

That's Mom Smackley, Mag.
You better watch out f or her.

Shove it.
Why, hello, Lace.
Back so soon?
I missed your
smiling face, Mom.
Let me see your hands.
Wait a second.
So nice to see you again,
Smackley.
Oh, hey.
What do we got here?
- What's your name, cutie pie?
- Maggie.
- She a Deb?
- Nope!
Good. You're smart.
Maybe we can become, uh...
friends.
You see, Maggie, a gang spoils it
f or good girls like you...
who get in here
by mistake.
But friends...
help each other.
Know what I mean?
Get your hands off of me,
you fat pig dyke!
All right. All right.

Gotta search inside.
Oh, no, you don't.
[ Smackley ]
Put her down, girls.
Aaah!
- Haaah!

[ Coughing ]
Full of ginger,

I know how to cool off
hot little chippies like you.
Come on.
T ake her to the john.
Give 'em hell, Maggie.
Come on.
Get up there!
Pretty hair, huh?
How'd you like me
to pull it out?
I bet you're a regular
little hooker, huh?
Well, we're gonna teach you
how to be real good.
[ Gurgling Noises ]
How'd you like that,
huh, bitch?
We're all alone.
And, honey,

[ Sinister Laughing ]
[ Laughing Continues ]
Put her down here, girls.
Kick the shit out

I'm gonna do it.
Ow! Ow!

Thought you knew better than
to f ool with a Dagger Deb, Mom.
She said she wasn't, Lace.
I didn't know she was one of yours.
She is now, fatso.
Lace, you're pushin' me
too far this time.
Hear you got a new sweetie
on the outside, Mom.
- What?
- Y eah.
Cute little trick named Violet,
ain't that right?
What of it?
Be a shame if anything
happened to her face. You know?
What do you want?
Hands off!
Y eah. Y eah, sure.
And no reprisals.
Oh, okay. All right.
Let's go.
Aaaah!
[ Groaning ]
I guess I owe you one.
Don't overrate yourself.
Mom had it coming.
You still saved my ass.
You gonna be okay?
Hell, yes.
I'll be outta here in a week.
They can't hold us.
We're juveniles.
You need anything?
A favor, Maggie.
Important one.
Get this to Dominic.
Will ya?
You know my Dominic?
He's my man.
I know the one.
I'd kill f or that guy.
Know what I mean?
Y eah, I do.
But why me?
Oh, I don't know.
Got a f eelin' about you,
I guess.
Like I can trust you.
You can.
Hey, come on, tramp.
Let's move it.
T ake care
of yourself, okay?
You, too.
And, Maggie,
watch your step.
We gotta do somethin'
about Crabs, Dom.
He and his guys have been muscling
our dealers all month.
I say we take him now,
bef ore it's too late.
I don't wanna face him when he's got
a couple of machine guns, man.
- No way.
- [ Door Opens ]
- What's this?
- This little beaver's
been askin' f or you, Dom.
I wanna talk to you.
In private.
Oh, yeah. You're the one who kicked
Patch's ass in Jobo's, right?
- Y eah, then what she doin' here?
- I just come from Lace.
She don't even know
where the hell Lace is.
She's in Sunday school
pullin' the Reverend's crank.
- Are we gonna talk, or not?
- We're all brothers here.
There's no secrets.
Okay.
Lace said she'd be in the joint
till next week.
She wants you
to read this.
Hey, that's not
f or you!
Come on, come on.
Give me the letter.
I wanna see it.
Y eah, we wanna hear what
the fairy princess has to say.
It's none of your
goddamn business.
- Aw, Dominic's pussy-whipped.
- Y eah, oughta get him a skirt.
Hey, up yours.
Now, give me the letter.
Okay. Read the letter, Dom.
Like you said, uh,
we ain't got no secrets.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
"My darling, Nicki."
Aw, ain't that wonderful?
- "Nicki." Holy shit.
- "My darling, Nicki.
As I sit here alone tonight...
counting the days till
I can lie in your arms again--

And tell you about the
special surprise I have f or you.
Uh, I thought of

- let each man do what he wants.

Y eah? Y eah, you'll what?
Hit me? Come on.
- Chicken-ass.

Jesus, Hook. I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
- There he is.
- Oooh.
Here. This stuff's pretty good.
Y eah. Why do we have to smoke
my bag all the time...
and not yours?
Because, eh.
Eh, baby.
Aw, I didn't know
you were out.
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
How's Junior, huh?
Did he miss me?
[ Dom ]
Oh, you know he did.
Been savin' him
just f or you.
Well, I guess we'll have
to fix him up then, huh?
Hey, here comes Mr. Weasel.
Hello, uh, boys.
Uh, may I join you?
Depends on what you want.
Just a little friendly chat.
Give the principal
your seat.
Give the principal
your seat!
My, my. You young men
are so well organized.
You want one?
No, I'm trying to cut down.
Listen, uh, Dominic,
I understand you and this Crabs
f ellow are on the outs.
Y eah, we're gonna smoke his ass if
he don't quit muscling our territory.
- I thought we might bury the hatchet.
- Y eah. Right in his marbles.
- [ All Laugh ]
- Why?
Because, uh,
in the interest of peace,
Crabs approached me
with certain proposals.
Now, wait a minute.
He's not in our district.
What's he talkin'
to you f or?
They closed down
Lincoln High.
Crabs and his boys
are being transf erred here.
And you want us
to make a deal, hmm?
Crabs thinks he should run
half the student patrols,
which strikes me as
eminently reasonable.
It does, huh?
Well, why don't you
stick your head up my ass...
sir.
[ Coughs ]
Well, if that's your attitude,
perhaps Crabs will end up
with all the patrols.
Go on. Everybody split.
Go ahead, man.
I want to think. Later.
You. Come here. Go ahead.
Come on.
Quite a guy, huh?
Y eah.
[ Lace ] That gives you a little idea
how we run things around here.
[ Maggie ]
Y eah?
[ Lace ] Later on I'll take you
down to the club house.
[ Lace ] We gotta find
you a good-lookin' stud.
Jealous?
What's it to you?
That new one's
a real f ox, ain't she?
Y eah, yeah. Why don't you
take her off my back, man?
Uh, the word's hands off.
What do you mean,
hands off?
Says who?
Nothin'. Uh, look,
I gotta split.
I'll catch you later.
Wait a minute, genius.
Let's, uh,
let's talk, uh--
Who says hands off, dear?
I don't believe it.
Hook is a liar!
Y eah, well, just think what you like.
It's your ass, not mine.
Maggie wouldn't cross me.
I gave her a break.
Y eah, and she
paid you back.
She read your letter
out loud and everyone laughed.
And they're laughing right now
every time you turn your back.
But why would Maggie
do that?
'Cause you've got
what she wants.
Damn it, Lace!
Open your eyes!
She's nailin' your man,
and everyone's laughin' in your face.
- You're just too blind to see it.
- Shut up!
Maggie's straight,
and I trust her.
Y eah.
What about Dom?
You trust him?
Figure it out, Lace.
Dom drops you,
and you're finished.
And you got two dozen hungry f emales
at your back, honey,
and each one has a score
to settle with you.
You take a fall,
and they're gonna smell your blood.
Been others
tried that bef ore,
and I'm still on top.
Y eah, but this
ain't bef ore.
Maggie's now,
and you're slidin'.
Maggie's my friend!
Do you know
what that means?
You got any friends,
Patch, hmm?
I can't aff ord any,
and neither can you.
What do you think?
It's up to him now.
Hey, Dom,
can I borrow 20 bucks?
For what?
Me and Cherry want
to make the movies.
Here. You just make sure you tell Ma
where you go. You hear me?
Aw. Okay, yeah.
[ Chattering, Faint ]
- Hi, Maggie.
- Hi, Mags.
- Hi.
Look, you wanna
do somethin' tonight?
What you wanna do can wait
till we iron somethin' out.
Like what?
I like you, Dom, but,
um, Lace is my friend,
and I won't
double-cross her.
What if I cut her loose?
What then?
You'll have
to ask me then.
What's to stop me from rippin' off
what I want like I did bef ore?
You try that again, and they'll be
pickin' steel out of your ass...
all the way
to the hospital.
Maggie moves fast.
Why don't you just,
uh, shut up, huh?
All right. Everybody,
shut up and listen.
Now, Hook and me
made up our minds.
Crabs is gonna show up
T uesday with his goons at school.
I want everybody to be cool.
You just do your thing
at school and if he don't interf ere,
we got no problems.
So, uh, what if
Crabs ain't cool?
My old man,
God rest his ass,
told me once,
"Son, don't ever let 'em
push ya,
'cause once they get you
movin', it's awful hard to stop."
- Hey, right on.
- That's it. I got nothin' else to say.
[ Lace ]
I do.
Most of you already know
my friend.
Like you to take
a good look.
Come here, Maggie.
Guess you two
already met, huh?
Y eah, we already met.
Nice to have you around.
Me, too.
Okay, then.
Maggie here is now
a sister...
and a member
of the Dagger Debs.
Anyone ob ject?
[ Patch ]
Wait a minute. I don't ob ject.
But, uh, she ain't one of us
till she pulls a job.
- Oh, initiate, initiate!
- Y eah, come on. What'll it be?
- Make her ball all the guys.
- Hey, knock it off.
You best mind
your own business, Dom.
Come on. I lost my eye
f or this gang, remember?
We used to be tough.
If she's gonna be tested,
make it a real test.
T ry me.
Okay, Maggie.
You bring us the medallion
that Crabs wears around his neck.
How do you want it
wrapped?
[ Chuckles ]
Hey, baby, you--
[ Wolf Whistle ]
May I help you?
Oh, yes, I'm-- I'm looking f or
the director of this post.
[ Chuckles ]
He's on vacation.
Oh. Well, I guess
I have to come back, then.
Well, the acting
director's in.
Uh, a Mr. Crabbits.
Oh, yes. He's the one.
I'm sure he can help me.
Theref ore, due to the grievous cuts
in f ederal funding...
f or our action politics...
and Operation Bootstrap
programs,
we f eel--
No, no, strike that.
We're f orced to request

Hey, you getting this?
- Crabs?
- Y eah.
There's a girl out there
would like to speak to you.
Y eah, what's she look like?
Y eah? Uh, I'll be right there.
I'll be right out.
Uh...
practice.
How do you do?
My name is Mr. Crabbits,
and this is my associate Mr. Fingers.
He's my special
pro ject coordinator...
in charge of special pro ject,
uh, coordination.
I'm Maggie, and, um--
Well, actually,
it's a rather personal problem.
Oh, of course,
of course, I know.
But can't you give us
just a rough idea?
I mean, we might have
to, uh, ref er you.
Well, it's my sister.
She's on drugs.
- Ah.
- Drugs?
Y es.
Oh.
Well, uh, if you could
step into my private office,
perhaps we could discuss
this matter in greater length and...
detail and, uh, depth.
Oh!
- Crabs.
- Y eah?
You don't know nothin'
about the dame.
You'll get yours.
Well, Maggie...
just, uh, how old
is your sister,
and how big a habit
does she have, uh,
dollar-wise?
I guess I better get right
to the point, Mr., uh-- Crabbits?
Crabbits.
Um...
I lied.
Oh. Really?
Y eah, well, you see,
I'm trying to join the Dagger Debs,
and the president, Dominic,
said that he'd take me
if I delivered a message.
What message?
I don't know what it means,
but he said f or me to tell you
that he met with Weasel,
and that the deal's okay.
You can have half.
No problem.
[ Speaking Softly ]
And I'm the icing on the deal.
What?
And I'm the icing
on the deal!
You're the icing on the deal.

Wow.
Dominic does have
a certain, uh,
flair.
[ Sighs ]
All right. Let's see the goods.
Come on.

Come on!
Well, aren't you gonna
take your clothes off?
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
No time, dear.
No time.
Right now I'm just gonna
settle f or something quick.
Oh, why, Mr. Crabbits,
I had no idea.
Mmm-hmmm.

And it's only, uh,
five bucks.
- No, I can't.
- Can't? From a man of science?
- Oh, God!
- Come on, superman.
Have a good time!
[ Dom ]
Hey, baby.
I'll take 10.
He'll have a better time.
How we doin'?
Hey, do I ever
let you down?
Be a shame if we
had to share it.
Well, hey, Dumbinic.
Hey, look, guys,
it's, uh, Dumb.
Dumb and the, uh,
dumb boys.
You're gettin' a little old,
ain't you, Crabs?
When you gonna graduate?
Well, you know, you can never get
too much education.
Guess that's 'specially true
in your case, huh?
By the way, Dom, real nice piece you
sent over last night.
I didn't send over nothin'.
Oh, no? That's too bad, Dumb,
because she was really quite a chick.
Y eah, great head.
Look, we got a rule
in this place.
Nobody carries nothin' here,
except the student patrol.
You understand?
[ Dom ] So, if you're carrying
anything, you get it out now.
Oh, you make me f eel
really bad, Dumb.
I mean, when I give my word,
I keep it, huh? Ask anybody.
- Right, huh?
- Right on, man.
Ask anybody. Ask our beloved
principal, Mr. Weasel.
Askin' you, queer.
What're you lookin' f or?
Come on.
You know, Dom, you oughta teach
your little brother some manners,
'cause he's, uh,
liable to off end somebody.
- Y eah, what's youth
comin' to, huh, Crabs?
- He's clean.
By the way, you haven't seen
my medallion, have you, Dumb?
No, I haven't.
It doesn't look anything
like this one, does it, huh?
Y eah, somethin' like it.
I sure hope
you find it, man.
Y eah, so do l.
Love ya.
Love ya, mama.
Let's waste his ass now.
You got the subtlety
of a Mack truck.
It's not him
we're gonna waste, stupid.
Not yet.
Dom's not giving us
his car to use.
He's my brother, ain't he?
He owes me at least that.
Nobody owes us nothin', Guido.
Y eah, well, pretty soon
Dom will be around--
[ Screaming ]
- Okay, go!
- [ Screaming Continues ]
No!
- No! [ Screaming ]
- Get in!
Hey, she's really
a blonde.
Okay, come on.
Me first, me first.
It's my turn, come on.
When do I get a chance?
[ Man ]
Sorry, Dom. Real bummer.
[ Crying ]
It's okay.
How's Guido?
Uh, he's all right.
Lost a lot of blood, but
they say he's got a good chance.
She say anything?
Nothin', man.
She's freaked out.
If Crabs wants trouble, right,
then he's gonna
get trouble now!
And we're gonna give it
to him!
Let's get him tonight,
all of us.
[ Lace ]
Let's bust his ass!
What, are you out
of your head?
[ Hook ] This is not
some over-the-hill bill collector.
We're talkin' about a gang
twice our size.
It's no good tonight.
Crabs'll be waitin' f or us.
Y eah? Then what
do you suggest, huh?
Crabs and his people use the
roller rink uptown every Friday night.
[ Maggie ]
It's neutral turf, so he'll f eel saf e.
Hit him then, with guns.
We'll carry them in
past the security guards.
Sounds good, Dom.
Sounds lousy! First of all,
we don't know the turf.
And anyway, why the hell should we trust
Maggie? What does she know about it?
I know the turf.
I used to live there.
What do you think, Lace?
Why ask me?
Okay, then Friday night.
Hook, we gotta talk.
You, too, Maggie.
Okay.
Bitch!
What's the matter, baby?
Nothin'. What's the matter
with you?
Nothin'. Just something missing.
Y eah? What?
You.
Look, this is me.
You don't like it, then maybe
you should find somebody else.
I don't want anybody else.
Come on, Nicki.
I know what you need.
Stop callin' me Nicki!
The guys are startin' to use it.
Okay. Hey, Dom.
Remember the letter?
Remember the surprise
I said I had f or you?
Y eah.
Well, we're gonna have a baby.
- A what?
- That was the surprise.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
I mean, you'd say anything
to get your way, wouldn't you?
No, it's the truth.
I swear it.
Had the doc check me
when I was in the joint.
Oh, Jesus. I don't have
enough on my mind.
I got a kid brother dyin'
in some meat-hook hospital,
and you gotta come up with
this shit now and dump it on me!
It's time we had something
to hold us together.
How do I even know
it's mine, huh?
You son of a bitch!
And what if it is mine?
So what?
Huh? You think I'm ready to haul
freight in some fuckin' warehouse...
f or two dollars an hour...
so you can have
a little brat suck on your tit?
No, thanks, baby.
It's our baby!
It ain't nothin' yet!
Everything was great
bef ore Maggie came around.
It's Maggie, ain't it?
She ruined everything!
Everything was lousy.
You were lousy!
The whole fuckin' gang
was lousy!
And this whole
goddamn place is shit!
You got knocked up, right?
Big deal!
Here, you know what to do.
You call me when it's over.
Dom, don't leave me.
If you go,
it's gonna turn out bad.
# # [ Organ ]
How many now?
[ Crabs ]
Let's really kick those guys' asses.
[ Fingers ] Right.
We'll kick the shit out of 'em, man.
Come on, Rita.
Let's waltz.
I don't know. Somethin'
don't seem right somehow.
Just make sure you start swingin'
when the time comes, huh?
Ooof!
[ Woman ]
Get 'em, get 'em. Charge.
[ Announcer On P.A. ]
All skaters off the floor.
All skaters off the floor.
Get off the floor, you girls.
Stop that fighting, girls.
- The police have been called.
- All right. Let 'em have it.
[ Guns Firing ]
[ Skaters Screaming ]
It's an ambush.
Somebody set us up.
No.
Dominic!
[ Lace ]
Nicki!
That's what you get, fink!
[ Groans ]
Lace!
[ Moans, Groans ]
We can't leave Dominic here.
- [ Sirens Approaching ]
- We can't help him now, Lace.
The cops are coming.
We gotta get you out!
No! No,
I won't leave him!
My Dominic!
Nicki!
[ Crying, Sobbing ]
[ Sirens, Louder ]
Nicki!
[ Crying ]
- [ Footsteps Echoing ]
- Nicki!
Lace?
Gee, thanks, guys.
He's, uh, he's real cute.
That's nothin'.
We just wanted to cheer you up.
Y eah, uh, would've been nice
f or the baby.
- We didn't know about the kid, Lace.
- Y eah, nobody knew.
Me and Dom were gonna
tell pretty soon.
He was so proud, you know.
Makin' big plans about [ Sniffs ]
gettin' married and everything.
Can you imagine that?
I mean, ain't that crazy?
I probably would've
got rid of it.
I mean, can you see me
havin' a kid?
Hangin' around some dumb house doin'
housework and dishes and diapers.
That's enough.
Don't talk about it, Lace.
[ Maggie ]
Lace...
I loved Dom, too.
We all did.
I know the roller rink
was my idea.
I'm really sorry things went wrong
the way they did.
Nobody blames you, Mag.
We gotta get back.
The guys wanna know
how you are.
- Better get some sleep, huh?
- Y eah.
We miss ya, Lace.
I'll, uh, send Patch
along in a minute.
I gotta give her a list
of stuff I need.
See ya.
Bye, Lace.
She misses me.
That bitch!
That bitch!
Cool it, Lace.
What's the matter with you?
He was supposed
to get her, not--
What do you mean?
He promised me he wouldn't
hurt Dom, only her!
Who promised what?
Lace, what did you do?
Crabs.
You tipped off Crabs
about the roller rink.
What could I do?
He was treating me
like a little gutter cat.
It was all because of her.
Just like you said!
Every time
I touched him,
I'd smell her
stinking perfume!
Stop it now!
You just stop it!
You gonna let her
take it all from you?
Or are you gonna act
like the Lace I know?
Just pull yourself
together, girl,
and start thinkin' how you gonna
pay that bitch back.
And you f orget you ever saw Crabs,
you understand?
Okay.
[ Car Approaching ]
Hey, cupcake, I wanna
talk to you f or a minute.
Look it, I don't know nothin',
I didn't do nothin'.
You think those hoods are gonna stick up
f or a fat squirt like you? Wise up.
Maybe she'd remember
on her way downtown.
You heard her.
She don't know nothin'.
So, unless you, uh,
got probable cause,
keep your hands off
my friend, huh?
A couple of gangs beat up
some innocent people...
at the roller rink
the other night.
We don't like that to happen.
It don't reflect well on us.
Hey, Bunny. You seen any gangs
around here lately?
- Gangs?
- Y eah.
No.
Uh, I seen a couple of stray pigs
rootin' around.
[ Laughing ]
Y eah, laugh it up, smart mouth.
Your turn'll come.
Look, get somethin'
straight, honey.
I don't care if you blow
each other's guts out.
Hell, I'm glad.
You save me the trouble.
But somebody clean gets hurt,
and I'll squash ya.
You understand?
Come on, Donut.
It's beginning to stink
around here.
I've had it.
We sit around here any longer,
and we'll have to crawl back to school.
Crabs has taken over, and nobody
is lifting a finger to stop him!
Shit. Half our guys
are still out of commission.
Look, the cops are on to us now.
They're gonna be watching.
- That's all they'll be doing.
- Long as it ain't their
throats that get cut.
The time ain't right.
We gotta lay low.
Look it, I am f ed up
with waiting.
We got our asses whipped last time.
I don't want to go back f or seconds.
Y eah, it was your
crazy plan, Maggie.
We had a chance if you'd
have stuck around and f ought.
The only one of you guys
that had a backbone was Dom...
and you left him to die.
- Shut up! I've heard enough!
- Who you telling what to do?
Look! Dominic is gone, and I'm
takin' charge. I got the right.
- We want Maggie.
- Y eah, we want Maggie.
You shut up
and sit down.
Ow!
- [ Coughs ]
- You're a chicken. Say it!
- I'm--
- Come on!
I'm... chicken.
I'm a big, fat,
yellow chicken.
I'm a big, fat,
yellow chicken.
I ain't f ollowin'
no chicken.
[ Groans ]
Well, I ain't f ollowing
no broad.
Then hit the road.
Come on, Bunny.
Let's go.
Not this time,
cripple dick.
Goddamn it, Bunny.
I told you never to call me that.
- It ain't true.
- Come on, Hook.
Everybody knows
your crank can hook a tuna.
[ Women Laugh ]
Are you comin' or not?
- Shove off!
- [ Can Clanks ]
You broads don't have
a chance.
- Get out!
- Go on!
Beat it. Get out.
- Move it!
- Get out.
- You cows are freaks!
- You'll never make it.
Nice goin', Mag.
We just lost half our muscle.
Lace'd be pleased.
Okay. Now I say
we need a new name.
We ain't gonna be anybody's
"Debs" anymore.
We are gonna be us.
You girls know what
a jezebel is?
I f ound it the other day
in the dictionary.
It says,
"an immoral, shameless...
impudent woman."
And from now on that's gonna be us.
The Jezebels, yeah!
T errific. That'll scare
Crabs to death.
You got another big plan
up your sleeve, Maggie?
Maybe.
Donut, Bunny, we're gonna
take a trip across town.
Uh, Maggie. Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.
Y eah, I think we oughta
go back.
- [ Hammer Cocks ]
- Hold it right there, whitey.
Frisk 'em!
Now inside, nice and easy.
Well... Iooka here.
I thought it
was you, Maggie.
Hello, Muff.
It's been a long time.
Oh, too long.
You'll have to, uh,
excuse my... girls,
but outsiders are
not welcome here.
Even the cops split.
Moved to a healthier climate,
as they say.
Nice layout.
Y eah. So what do
you want?
We need some help.
Me and my girls here
were the Dagger Debs,
and now,
we're the Jezebels.
No men?
Cowards.
We kicked 'em out.
Good.
Now that's real good.
You know, sooner or later
every woman's bound to find out.
The only thing a man's
got below his belt is clay f eet.
Come on.
Let's talk about it.
These are my girls.
T oby, Java, Cheryl, Hench.
We got kind of a political
discussion group going.
- You know what I mean.
- Y eah.
You know how to read?
Oh, you're into
some heavy stuff.
Political power grows out
of the barrel of a gun.
- Dig?
- Y eah, we dig.
Well, that's science, but they
don't teach it in the schools.
They will when
we run 'em.
This a sample
of your sisters?
They can fight.
There just ain't enough of us.
Now some people are
leaning on us pretty bad.
Mao says don't waste time
on personal grudges.
Y eah. What's in it f or us?
You need guns?
We can always use more.
Well, this guy's got an arsenal.
And who might that be?
The one they call Crabs.
That capitalist gangster.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Y eah, we know him.
That bastard drives around
in his T een Post truck...
Iike he's giving away
free f ood to the poor.
Meanwhile, he's dealing
dope on the side.
Y eah, he gets little kids hooked
on those vitamin pills he's pushin'...
so he can lay some smack
on 'em later.
Y eah. We're in
f or old times' sake.
I'm really gonna
en joy this.
He's well organized, Muff.
It won't be easy.
Y eah? Well, we got a surprise
f or old Crabs.
A great big
motherfuckin' surprise.
Like what?
You'll see. Right now
it's training time.
I'm gonna scrounge up a couple of M-16s
courtesy of the National Guard.
Come on, baby.
Where do you
know her from?
Used to go with
her brother once...
till the cops off ed him.
Oh.
Be ready to kill her,
or don't go in that door.
Back off, Patch.
Let me handle it my way.
Lace, she's cuttin' you
from the inside.
The girls listen to her.
Nobody takes what's mine.
Maggie wants blood,
she'll get it.
[ Rifles Firing ]
I spread the word
on Crabs' turf.
- They'll be staying clear
of his truck, okay?
- Cool.
Hi, Lace. Where've you been?
We've missed you.
Been busy, huh?
Another one of your big plans?
No sense wastin' time, Lace.
Me and the girls were just
getting things ready f or you.
Muff, this is Lace.
She's the leader of
the Jezebels.
If you say so, Maggie.
Okay, listen.
Everybody, I've got just
one thing I want to say.
Those lousy murderers
killed my Dom,
and each one of you
got burned.
And I want you
to remember that tomorrow,
'cause we're gonna carve
our names...
in those bastards' chests!
[ Cheering, Shouting ]
They're lookin' good, Maggie.
You can count
on them, Lace.
But I got a favor to ask ya.
I want Crabs alive.
Oh, yeah? Why?
Dominic's dead 'cause somebody tipped
Crabs off about the roller rink,
and I'm gonna find out who.
Y eah. Y eah.
That's a good idea,
Maggie, yeah.
Come on, Maggie.
We got things to do, man.
We got a lot of work to do.
You heard. She's not gonna stop
till we're screwed.
You've gotta take care
of her now.
Y eah, I guess so.
Be sad if, uh, Maggie
had an accident tomorrow...
with all those bullets
flying around.
Y eah. You just make damn sure
you don't miss.
Here. Pour it.
Good f or the kiddies.
Where is everybody?
It's too quiet around here.
Get the drugs.
What's all this garbage?
Leave the f ood alone.
What's the matter, girls? Looks
like you're back f or more, huh?
Hey, Lace.
You hear somethin'?
Y eah. It sounds like
a furry little rat.
Hey, where'd you get
this stuff?
Hey, put that down.
And you, get away from the doughnuts.
It's f or the kids, not you.
Where'd you get this stuff?
In a sewer?
Y eah, it's good stuff.
Now put the doughnuts away.
All right, ladies.
T ear up the truck!
[ Women Shouting,
Cheering ]
[ Shouting Continues ]
Those crazy chicks, they
got the truck all over the ground.
Look what they done to me.
Look at you? I got a meeting
with the mayor in 25 minutes!
- God, why does this
always happen to me?
- [ Gunshots ]
They got guns! Guns!
Get the-- Get the guns!
- [ Gunshots ]
- [ Women Shouting, Hooting ]
Get away from that truck!
Get away from the truck!
[ Gunshots ]
All right! Come on!
Come on!
We need help! Come on!
Down that way!
[ Gunshots Continue ]
[ Crabs ]
Get behind 'em!
Remember,
I want him alive.
[ Car Approaching ]
[ Crabs ] Wait a minute.
What the hell is that?
Oh, shit!
[ Muff ] Let's go get 'em, girls,
f or the revolution.
That's f or Angela.
Power to the people.
[ Crabs ] Wait a minute.
Somebody call the goddamn cops.
Ohh! Aah!
[ Woman Screaming ]
[ Y elling ]
Pin him against the wall.
[ Screaming ]
Shit!
Where's Maggie at?
There.
Lace, what're you
waitin' f or?
It's gotta look like
an accident.
Y eah, but it's gotta
happen now.
[ Gunshots Continue ]
Goddamn it!
Hello, Crabs.
Just gotta ask ya
a couple questions.
Has he talked yet?
- [ Sirens Approaching ]
- [ Maggie ]
We're just getting acquainted.
Come on, Lace.
We gotta go.
No time!
Not bef ore we get
some inf ormation.
No! Wait!
Don't shoot! Please!
I'll tell you anything--
Aaaah!
[ Groans ]
You son of a bitch!
- He was gonna talk!
- [ Sirens Continue ]
He was goin' f or his gun.
He could've killed ya.
Y eah. Pretty convenient.
What do you mean,
convenient?
- [ Sirens Continue ]
- [ Gunshots Continue ]
T ask squad, Maggie.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Y eah, I'll be there.
No reason
to hang around now.
[ Sirens Continue,
Louder ]
[ Women Chattering ]
- Ah, that's nice.
- Now cut it.
Use this one.
Lace, come on.
Everything is all set.
What're you doin'?
Funny how things
turn out, isn't it?
What's the matter with you?
You losin' your nerve?
Ever since Dom went,
I f eel all empty inside.
Listen, Lace. Lace!
Maggie is out there...
settin' me up f or a fall.
But I ain't goin' down alone.
Look, babe,
I know how
you must f eel, man.
You've been through
so damn much lately.
And here I am,
your best friend, yelling at ya.
I'm sorry, all right?
Okay.
Now, listen.
Both of 'em are ready.
All you have to do
is make your move,
and the rest'll go along
once they see you're on top again.
That's right.
Oh. Here.
Let me, uh, help you
fix your hair.
You gotta look good f or this.
Have some of this cake.
- Y eah, isn't that fantastic?
- T errific.
Hey, here comes Lace.
- Hey, Lace.
- You look good, Lace.
- Join the party.
- We've been waitin' f or ya.
Hi, Lace.
You f eelin' better?
Feelin' just fine, Bunny.
Well, good.
We've been waitin' f or ya.
Hey, did you see our cake?
Hey, Donut.
How ya been?
Hiya, Lace.
Still friends?
Y eah, yeah, sure.
Still friends.
What's that f or?
Oh, uh, I was just
gettin' this f or Maggie.
Uh-huh.
Well, get me one!
You heard me.
Okay. You can, uh...
have this one.
Hey, hero.
Why so glum?
Just thinkin'
about somethin'.
Y eah? What?
Patch didn't shoot Crabs
by mistake.
She had another reason.
Such as?
I don't know.
Do you?
Hey, listen up, everybody.
I've got a surprise f or you.
Me and Maggie here have been through
a lot of scrapes in the past f ew weeks,
and, uh, she's mean
and she's tough...
and she's bad.
And each of us owe her
somethin' in our own special way.
And me,
I owe her more
than any of you.
And that's why
I have this surprise...
that I just f ound out about
f or sure last night.
Our own little Maggie here
is a fuckin' traitor!
What're you doing, Lace?
She spilled our attack plan
to Crabs and got Dominic killed.
Then she tried
to take over the gang.
It was an ambush, man.
She set the whole thing up.
That can't be true.
Nobody f ought better than her.
Y eah. She even saved
your ass, Lace.
Y eah. She did that
to cover herself, man.
She was Crabs' girl all along.
We checked.
I don't believe it.
You knew it, too.
Didn't you, Donut?
Maggie told you
all about it, didn't she?
Well, uh...
I guess so, Lace.
I mean, l-- I think I remember
something like that.
And that's how she got
the medallion so easy, wasn't it?
Crabs gave it to her so Dominic
would fall f or the whole story.
Ain't that so?
Um... yeah.
I guess so.
That's not true.
Let me up.
Let her talk.
She'll talk, all right.
And she'll tell the truth.
It was you, wasn't it?
You and Patch.
Why, Lace?
[ Maggie ]
Why?
[ Screaming ]
Enough!
When I say so!
It won't work anymore, Lace.
- Walk soft, honey.
- What was that?
She said it's no good.
We're not buying it,
not from you or Donut, either.
I didn't mean it.
They made me say it. I'm sorry.
You're through, Lace.
You're out.
- I'm out?
- That's what I said!
Okay, you want me out,
you're gonna have
to fight me.
Or anybody else who's
got enough guts to take me on.
What about you, Ginny?
You got a pretty face.
It'd look real good with a big scar.
What about you, Donut?
Want me to slice off
some of that extra blubber?
I'm sorry!
Come on! Who's got
the guts to try it?
- Come on!
- I will.
Okay, Maggie.
Don't be shy.
You were never shy
with Dom, were you?
So, that's it, ain't it?
You got your man killed
'cause you couldn't hold him.
And I'd kill him again
to keep him from you.
You know somethin'
funny, Lace?
You were wrong.
There was nothin'
between me and Dom.
It was all you.
Liar!
You've had it!
[ Panting ]
[ Grunting,
Panting Continues ]
Aaah!
[ Police Radio,
lndistinct ]
[ Police Radio ]
Verifying the DLB as 1105.
The exits are covered.
Let's bust 'em.
Now wait a minute.
They're fighting among themselves.
If someone gets killed, we'll finally
have a charge that'll stick.
You're all heart,
aren't you, Rizzo?
- [ Groaning ]
- [ Panting ]
[ Groaning ]
Aaah!
I'll kill you!
[ Groans ]
Lace!
[ On Megaphone ]
This is the police.
Throw down your weapons
and put your hands above your head.
Keep away from the body.
This time it's murder, honey.
You play by my rules.
You're nobody now.
- We're the Jezebels, fatso.
- [ Woman ] Stop it!
I thought there were
no gangs around here.
What about you?
Jezebels.
- And you?
- Jezebel.
- Jezebels!
- Jezebels!
- Jezebels!
What about you?
She ain't with us.
Sure I am. I always been.
I don't know her.
That's right.
Don't know her.
- She's not one of us.
- Never seen her bef ore.
She ain't one of us.
Okay, Jezebels.
- [ Women Arguing ]
- All right. Let's go.
You're hurting me!
Leave me alone.
I'm coming.
Goddamn it!
Leave me alone.
Owww!
Let me give you
some advice.
No. Let me give you
some advice, cop.
You can beat us, chain us,
lock us up.
But we're gonna be back!
Understand?
And when we do, cop,
you better keep your ass off our turf,
or we'll blow it off!
You dig?
