Those are beautiful eyes.
Okay, open wide and look straight ahead.
That's it.
All right.
How's Emily? She must be what, two now?
- Twenty-two months. She's amazing.
- Wow.
- I'm so in love with her.
- I know the feeling.
- How's Samantha?
- She's great.
She's still pulling down straight A's,
and she gets more beautiful every day.
She's just amazing.
- They're perfect, aren't they?
- Yeah.
You never want them to grow up.
No, you don't. You don't.
Will you just try to read this
with your right eye?
"Z," "C," "S," "R," "H," "N."
Okay, here's the hard part.
So she screams into
the phone, "My husband's passed out.
"I don't know what to do.
I can't wake him up."
And the operator asks,
"Well, what happened, ma'am?"
She's mortified, but she figures
she's got to tell the truth, right,
so she says in this really panicky little
voice, "I was giving him a blow job!"
So she just keeps on going, she's like,
"I guess I'm just really good at it.
"I got these lips, they're really spongy,"
and she goes on for five minutes
describing her technique to the operator.
- I can't believe you did that!
- I had to!
- She deserved it. She was a witch.
- Turn around please.
Oh, no! Hannah, not again!
- No.
- Oh, not again!
Okay, okay, you want spongy lips, baby?
- Hey, Mrs. Marris.
- Hi, Amelia, Taylor, boys.
Hi.
- Is Sam home?
- Yeah, she's doing her homework.
Actually, we came by
to pick her up to study.
It's getting a little close to dinnertime.
Just for a couple of hours, we promise.
- We get way more done in a group.
- Yeah.
Okay, one sec.
Sam!
Sam!
- Sam!
- What?
- Why is your door locked?
- Privacy?
Are you studying with the music this loud?
Is that what you came up here
to ask me about?
- Your friends are downstairs.
- Oh, cool.
Honey, dinner's at 7:00.
Really? I never knew that.
Why is the most beautiful woman
in the world in my kitchen?
Turn around.
Not until you say it.
That's fine, I can work back here.
You know I will.
I've looked into 15 pairs of eyes today,
but my day doesn't begin
until I look into yours.
Hey, Sam, honey.
How was your day, sweetheart?
The same as every other day.
Can you help out with dinner
before you go upstairs?
What am I? A housewife?
Sam, that's no way to talk to your mother.
Sorry.
I have homework. Can I go upstairs?
- That's you.
- Me?
- That's you.
- No, it's not.
- Oh, yeah. That's you.
- No, it's not, I hope not.
- That's you about 20 years ago.
- Oh, Jesus.
Can I sleep over at Taylor's tomorrow night?
Again?
I want to hang out with her before we leave.
Yeah, you got to pack though.
I'll do it tomorrow morning.
And your room. I mean, can you just try
and clean your room just a little bit?
- Are you done?
- Yeah, yeah, thank you.
- Dad, can I?
- Yeah, here, take your mom's.
Please, please can I?
I don't know.
She's got to get ready for the trip.
It's been a while since
we had a night alone together.
That's true.
Do you promise, or do you really promise?
I really promise.
Can we trust her?
I think so.
Promise you'll get
everything done.
Swear.
All right.
Okay, thank you.
Yes, get going.
Hey, I need you home
by 9:00 tomorrow morning.
- Yes, I know.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
- Why?
Because it's embarrassing.
Why? There's no one else here.
Mom, I'm 16 and you still think I'm 10.
I didn't realize you were
too old to kiss your mother.
Yeah, well, I am.
Just a little kiss?
Happy?
- Hey, hon. Hey, Ben.
- Oh.
What is that?
Don't look, don't look...
Close your eyes, look straight ahead.
- What's this?
- You've seen nothing,
hoping that is dinner.
- Hold on. Come on, this way.
- Okay.
When did you learn to do all this?
Well, I've been married to
a great cook for 17 years,
so I picked up a few things.
- It smells good.
- Look at this.
Oh, my God.
Well, I don't know how this all happened.
I go to get the mail, I come back in,
and all this is here. Just like this.
I don't know. Shit! My chicken!
My chicken!
It's so beautiful, hon.
I was four months pregnant then.
Yeah, you sent me out into the streets
of Provence at 4:00 in the morning.
Second night of our honeymoon
to find you roast beef on rye.
And all they have...
All they have is like tongue or brains.
- That's all they had.
- Didn't know the difference.
I was a desperate man. I knew if I didn't
come home with a big hunk of meat,
I wasn't going to get any
for the rest of the trip.
What do you see, Dr. Marris?
Hmm.
It's a little dark,
but I see the first and last woman
I'll ever love.
Come with me.
You're the best.
Thank you so much.
Such a sweet thing.
I can help.
Right here.
- She looks exhausted.
- Oh, yeah. Bet she didn't sleep last night.
- She can nap in the car.
- Yeah, but you can't.
Yeah, I'll get some coffee.
- Okay.
- Your lips are spongy. I feel like fainting.
- I love you, too.
- I'm sorry, sweetie.
- Call me when you get there.
- Sorry, darling.
Have a nice weekend.
- Okay.
- You be good, kid.
I'm not a kid.
That's right, you're not. You're not a kid.
- I'm bad.
- My bad.
- It's my bad. Yeah.
- Your bad? Oh, it's my bad.
- Whatever. Goodbye.
- My bad. Peace out.
Peace, word.
Word out.
Mom! Are you taking my picture?
I already told you, I hate it when you take
my picture. Why don't you listen to me?
Honey, it was just one shot.
You're an amateur. You take pictures
of buildings, of cows, of nothing!
When are you going to do something real?
What?
Can we talk?
Why do you constantly have
to talk about everything?
I just want to know
what's going on with you,
why you're acting this way.
I want things to be better between us...
Yeah, well, it's never going to happen
so just get over it.
Why am I the bad guy?
Hmm?
You don't treat your father like this.
Because he's not on my back all the time.
He treats me like an adult.
No, he spoils you, and you're not an adult.
- Well, I'm not a baby, either.
- Someone has to...
Mom, I can take care of myself, okay?
Jesus!
Look, just don't be mad at me
because I care about you.
- I love you.
- Yeah, well, maybe a little bit too much.
Mom, look out!
Marris, Hannah and Samantha Marris.
M-A-R-R-l-S.
Second floor.
Hannah?
She opened her eyes!
Hannah, you're in the hospital.
Do you remember you were in an accident?
I'm going to remove your breathing tube.
I need you to blow out...
- now!
- Breathe out.
- Deep breaths.
- Hannah, breathe out.
That's it.
Cough, cough.
Hey.
Hannah.
That's not...
I don't know.
You're gonna be okay, baby.
What's happening?
- You had an accident.
- Accident?
- You had a car accident.
- A car accident?
Yeah.
- Where is Sam?
- Sam's fine.
What happened to Sam?
She's right here.
Oh, Sam!
Oh, Sam!
- I'm so sorry.
- Honey, it's not your fault.
- I'm so sorry, I didn't know.
- It's not your fault.
- No, it's gonna be okay. It's not your fault.
- I didn't see it.
It's going to be okay. I love you.
- I didn't see it. I love you.
- I love you. I love you.
She's crashing!
Sam! Bring me closer. Bring me closer.
Sam!
- Quick, bring the reanimation cart!
- Give me her hand.
Give me her hand! Give me her hand!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam! Sam! Sam!
Get another doctor in here! Now!
Sam!
Sam!
Paddles!
- The mother's collapsing.
- Paddles!
- Flat line. No readable pulse.
Hurry up! Turn the dopamine drip
wide open.
Get her a round of high-dose epi,
pulse ox. Get those paddles ready.
- Charge 200! One, two, all clear!
- No corneal reflex.
Prepare for the paddles.
- Pull back the sheets.
Paddles won't work. She's in asystole.
Charge 300, all clear.
Give me a five defib.
Charge to 100.
- No, no, give me that, 160.
- Charging!
Charging 200, clear.
Paddles clear. Charge 200.
Charging at 260. Everyone clear.
- Charging!
- Charging.
Slaps on.
Don't forget your pads on, right now.
Chest compressions.
She's not capturing.
She's throwing PBC.
Resume chest compression.
Come on!
Let's call it.
5:52.
I'm so sorry.
We did everything we could.
- Doctor, she's got a pulse!
- Hold that!
- Dilocaine.
- We've got a rhythm.
Max them again.
Okay, let's move her to the ICU.
- Keep ventilating her.
- Come on.
Sam?
Sam?
- How's Sam? Is she okay?
- How are you feeling?
- Where's Sam?
- What?
- What?
- Where's Sam?
My voice sounds so different.
You sound like you.
You sound like Sam.
Sam.
Sam, I got to...
I got to tell you something.
Oh, Sam. Your mother died, Sam.
My mother died?
My mom died.
Oh, God.
In the accident.
In Boston?
Your grandmother lives in Boston, Sam.
Your grandma.
Why do you keep calling me Sam?
Because that's your name, honey.
Oh, my...
Do you hurt?
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I need to see a mirror.
- Oh, yeah, I got this stuff for you.
- I need to see a mirror.
Can I see a mirror?
It's not my hand.
You have some bruises.
- Oh, God.
- Okay.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
It's not me!
- It's not me!
- Sam!
- It's not me!
- Honey! Stop that!
Honey!
Sam!
What happened to me?
Where's my daughter?
We've already ruled out a traumatic
brain injury with the CAT scans.
- Physically, she's okay.
- What can it be then?
It could be anything,
from an extreme case of post-traumatic
stress disorder to delirium, even.
But my guess is that this is simply
a case of temporary mental dysfunction.
- She's confused.
- Temporary?
Mr. Marris, your daughter just went through
an extremely traumatic ordeal.
The accident and the death of her mother.
Sometimes, it's just too much
for the mind to handle.
I'm very sorry.
Very sorry about your wife.
Take care.
Sam, want me to make something from...
On our first date,
you took me to see the beach
and afterwards we sat by the water
for four hours and kissed,
and when you dropped me off,
you told me no one had ever looked at you
the way that I look at you.
I saw my entire future that night.
To this day, I can smell
your Ralph Lauren cologne on me,
and it's still my favorite smell.
Did your mother tell you that?
Ben, this is me, Hannah, your wife.
And I don't know where our daughter is.
Okay.
Daddy, Daddy!
Hey. It's okay.
What the hell?
You're cooking?
I hope spinach and mushroom is okay.
- That's all I had.
- You don't cook.
Sit.
You had a nightmare last night.
You were talking in your sleep.
I was?
What did I say?
You called out for your daddy.
You called out for me.
You sounded like you did
when you were a little girl.
"Daddy"? I said "Daddy"?
Was it me? Was it my voice?
Did it sound like...
Sure, it sounded like you, Sam.
She must be in here somewhere.
If I called out "Daddy," then it was her.
Honey, honey, I think you're confused
because of the accident.
What you're talking about is impossible.
You have a two-inch mole on your right
thigh. It's shaped kind of like a peanut,
and we measured it once with a ruler.
And you sneak a cigarette when you drink,
and you like it when I rub your back
until you fall asleep at night and...
And your day doesn't begin
until you come home and you look
me in the eyes and you say it.
That's not proof, that's not proof.
Somebody could've told you that.
Your mother could've told you that.
Your mother told...
Your mother could have told you that.
Ben, come in here.
Ben!
What do you see, Dr. Marris?
What do you see?
What the fuck? Cut it out!
I want you to stop right now, okay?
I'm terrified. I'm so scared, but I'm not crazy,
and I'm not confused, and I'm not delirious,
and I'm not mentally ill.
But something has happened to me,
and I don't know what it is,
and I need you to believe me
because it's true.
I can't even begin to comprehend
what you're trying to tell me.
All I know is that we're going to
my wife's funeral this morning.
That much is true.
My God, what am I going to tell
my family and my friends and...
I don't know what happened, but it's true,
and you have to believe me.
- Sam, Sam.
- Stop calling me that.
Neither of us have any real idea
of what's going on.
The doctor said it was temporary,
so I think we wait.
Look at me.
Until then, we keep this a secret, okay?
Between us. No exceptions.
Now into God's keeping we
commend our sister Hannah, here departed.
We commit her body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Trusting in God's great mercy.
Grant Hannah eternal rest, O Lord,
and let light perpetual shine upon her.
May her soul
and the souls of all the departed,
through your divine mercy, rest in peace.
Amen.
Oh.
Sam, darling,
there are some friends of yours outside.
Friends?
I'm serious.
- Hey.
- Sam.
We're really sorry about your mom, I mean...
I'm sorry.
- Brought you some shit.
- What?
- I knew you'd need it.
- Maybe we should go smoke out in the car.
- Yes, yes.
- What?
I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll light it for you.
You okay?
- Fuck the car.
- You all right?
Just...
Here, hit this.
No.
- All right.
- You sure?
- Hey, so you got your wish, huh?
- What?
She's gone forever. It came true.
- Ow.
- Show some fucking tact, asshole.
He's a fucking asshole.
She said...
- I have to go, I'm sorry.
- Sam.
Well, wait, do you want us to like,
give you...
- Nice. Good fucking job. Well done.
- Well... Sorry.
Sam, I'm really sorry.
I'm so happy to see you.
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. I can't even imagine
what you're going through.
You have no idea.
You can call us any time
if you need anything.
Thank you.
I know I can always count on you guys.
I mean, thanks.
Sam, you all right?
I can't do this alone.
Sam's friends just came over here
to smoke pot with her on the porch.
And if she was there, she would have been
smoking pot with them, too.
- You're smoking pot?
- No, I'm not smoking pot.
And she has a tattoo on her ass.
Did you know that?
- What?
- It says Justin. Who is Justin?
And she told her friends
she wished I was dead.
Why would she say something like that?
- Teenagers say stuff like that all the time.
- That's my daughter!
I would have never said
anything like that when I was 16.
- No, you wouldn't have.
- She has a tattoo...
You believe me?
Yeah, I do.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
But we're going to find out, I promise.
- Excuse me.
- May I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for information on...
I don't exactly know how to put this.
Transference or possession.
- Excuse me.
- Things of that nature.
You mean, like demonic?
Uh...
No, more like spiritual.
In a small African village, a woman
was in a coma after a serious illness,
and she miraculously revived.
- When did this happen?
- About 10 years ago.
But when she woke up,
she said she was someone else.
A young girl who had died that same day
in a village over 100 miles away.
The woman knew intimate details,
everything about the young girl's life.
Were they from the same family?
As far as I was able to determine,
the two were complete strangers.
I mean,
no connection between them whatsoever.
The woman recovered from her illness
but retained the girl's personality.
Seven years?
That's how long I'm supposed
to live like this? Seven years?
I have no idea.
- I wish I were dead.
- Don't say that. Do not say that.
Listen to what we're saying.
- What are we even talking about here?
- I still think it's physical.
- It's not physical!
- It could be an undetected case
of temporal lobe seizure
or abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
I think there's a medical explanation
for what you're dealing with.
Where is she?
Is she sleeping?
Is she still here?
And if she is, does that mean one of us
is going to disappear completely?
What do I have to do to get her back?
I think we have to be patient.
I think we have to wait for Sam
to come back.
I think you need to take care of yourself
for her.
And I think you need to go back to school
in Sam's place.
We need to take care of her life for her,
so it's there for her when she returns.
You agree?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Ben, I haven't been to school in, like,
20 years. I don't...
You always did great in school.
But Sam is in all honors classes,
and I didn't even go to college.
But that was a choice you made.
It's not because you weren't smart enough.
- It was a conscious decision.
- I don't know about that.
I do. I remember.
Don't make excuses.
I don't want you coming home
with anything less than an A-.
Fuck you.
Fucking so freaked out.
You went through her books, right?
You know all the classes she's taking.
You definitely look the part.
- That's all that matters, right?
- It is.
You're gonna be fine. Now go.
Okay, okay, okay, Jesus.
Hey, Sam. Don't do drugs.
That's my girl.
He's just a smartass.
It's time, gentlemen.
I like skating.
Hey, who are you,
and what did you do with Sam?
Sam!
- What's up with the flood, sister?
- You smoking the chronic again?
Good for you!
- You get jealous.
- That's right. You get jealous.
No, it's not good for you.
Where is my locker?
Wait. Oh, my God, I'm gonna pee.
I'm gonna pee my pants.
Sam! That's so excellent.
That is so excellent.
Okay. Come with us.
- "Where's my locker?"
- Check here.
You're silly.
I got to go, baby, but I'll see you later.
Did you smoke, seriously?
Sam, it's this one. Oh, my God.
- Do you know what my combo is?
- Isn't it your dad's birthday?
- Right.
- Yeah.
Missed you. So don't be late, all right?
And I need those notes.
Okay.
You like having my name on your ass?
So, now you're mine.
And I've really got you fucked
just getting to know it.
I'm married! What the fuck? Who are you?
So that's the way you want to play it.
- What are you doing?
- All right, all right.
You're a desperate housewife.
Every afternoon...
Stop! Get off me!
...we get a hotel, and I fuck your brains out.
You've never had dick this good,
this hard in your life.
What?
- What is your problem?
- What's my problem?
You liked playing with me before.
Stay away from me.
Don't touch me again, okay?
I'm sorry, can you just excuse me
a moment? You can relax.
I'll just be one second.
We got the phone right here.
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.
- I can't do this. Someone's gonna find out.
- Honey, honey, honey.
Calm down, calm down. What happened?
I was at my locker, and these kids
are so young, but they act like they're old.
And they're not, and they're having sex.
What? You're having sex?
Yes, I'm having sex,
with more than one person I think.
Jesus Christ!
Are you okay?
No! No, I...
Well, I'm gonna come down there.
I'm gonna come down and pick you up...
- I got to go. I have class.
- No, just hold...
- That was my daughter.
- It's all right.
Sorry, that was my dad.
Tara Corbett.
Hi, Tara, Ms. Corbett. This is Ben,
Ben Marris, I called earlier today.
Yes, hi.
Yeah, Sam just called me. She's very upset,
and I was just wondering
if maybe you could take a look at her,
look on her. Check up on her.
Don't worry,
I'll go find her and call you back.
Thank you.
Samantha? Sam?
Honey, are you okay?
I just wanted to see
how your first day back was going.
I know how overwhelming this must be,
coming back so soon.
I think you're so brave.
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you as a friend.
If there's anything I can do,
you just ask, okay?
Who are you, again?
I'm Tara. I'm your guidance counselor.
- Okay.
- All right.
Thank you. I appreciate the...
- It's what I'm here for.
- Thank you.
She used my birthday.
I just wanted to call
and thank you for today.
It really helps to know that
there's somebody there looking after her.
You're very welcome.
That's what I'm here for.
Well, that's great. Okay.
I'm really glad you called, Ben.
Well, thank you. I thank you,
and we'll speak soon.
Oh!
- Hey, it's just me.
- No, it's not, though.
Why don't we pop in a DVD tonight, huh?
Like we used to.
I have homework.
Today started off pretty bad,
and it just got worse. I think it's...
My friend, Carol, is having a party.
I'm really excited to go.
I can't believe Mom and Dad
made me move to this horrible place.
How could they do this to me?
It's so incredibly selfish, there are no words.
I have no control, no say.
I'm at their mercy, and it blows.
How could they ever think
this boring little nothing of a town
would be better than Boston?
Slope of the curve at a point
is the slope of its tangent line at that point.
Define this limit of the slopes
of the secant line.
I feel like the biggest freak on the planet.
I don't know a single person in this school.
They're all probably
stupid drug addicts anyway.
No one will even look at me.
Little by little,
I'm going to disappear into thin air
until I become completely 100% invisible.
What's wrong?
You seem out of it.
I'm just tired.
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
but I don't want to see your chances
of getting into a top college go away.
- College?
- We've had this discussion.
You can get into an Ivy League school.
Your PSAT scores prove it.
But you have to maintain your grades.
I'm not going to coddle you
like the rest of your teachers.
Okay. Thank you.
- Also, what's up with your handwriting?
- What?
You're not printing anymore.
The essay's in script.
Oh.
I changed my handwriting. I didn't like it.
I thought it was kind of childish,
so I started writing differently. No reason.
- Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
I miss you.
What are we doing?
I'm getting some dirty looks.
- Fuck them.
- That's nice.
Is that what they teach you at school? Can't.
Speaking of school, there's a party
happening in a couple weeks.
- Party happening?
- Yeah, party happening.
Some kid's parents
are going out of town. Typical.
- But you're not going to go, right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Sam would go, so...
- Well, then maybe I'll come with you.
- I don't think so.
I think so. I'll just show up.
I'm not going to bring my father
to a party with me. Thank you.
No. Hey, what...
I wanted that, you know.
I needed that.
You've got to be careful.
You're drinking a lot.
You're drinking like a fish, like a frat boy.
It's the rebellious thing,
comes with the body.
I have to pee. I'll be right back.
Sam.
Sam, Sam.
Dad.
Hannah?
Yeah?
Tara Corbett is here, new patient.
- Hi.
- Hi.
These photographs in the hall,
they're beautiful. Who took them?
Um... My wife.
She was a photographer?
Well, yeah, not professionally, but yes.
I'm very sorry about what happened.
How can I help you?
I think I might need glasses.
Well, you've come to the right place.
I've been putting it off for a while, so...
Oh, yeah, everybody does.
Nobody wants to come see me.
I think it's time.
Well... Well, no, have a seat. Come on.
Now...
No, I'll take your money later.
He's finishing up with a patient.
Why don't you stick your head in?
- I'm sure he won't mind.
- Okay. Thank you.
Open wide and look straight ahead.
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead. Come a little closer.
There you go. Wide, right there.
- You're missing a button.
- What?
Oh.
Yeah.
Hannah?
So, do you interact
with all of your female patients that way?
- What?
- Don't play dumb, okay? It's not attractive.
Sam, she's your guidance counselor.
Yes, yes, I know that.
Thank you, by the way,
for siccing her on me while I was at school.
I met with her on your first day back
to try to smooth things over,
and then I called her after you called me
hysterical. She's been very helpful.
- Oh, yeah, I bet she has been.
- Then she came in for glasses, end of story.
I saw the way that you looked at her.
I saw it.
You betrayed our trust after 20 years.
Jesus, isn't that a little extreme?
Don't talk to me about extreme, okay?
- Nothing happened.
- Fuck you.
Jesus, you're insane.
I told you nothing happened.
Yeah, but you considered it, didn't you?
I'm married. I love my wife.
- And where is your wife?
- Standing right in front of me.
- But you can't have sex with her?
- No, and I don't think I ever will again
since her body is 6 feet underground.
- That's your third one.
- Yeah, so?
You think drinking
is gonna help you forget?
That's the idea.
You're pathetic.
I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to do.
You've got a 36-year-old wife
in the perfect body of a 16-year-old.
I'm like every man's wet dream.
And how many have you had?
Two, three. I lost count.
Dance with me.
Please.
Ben.
Yeah.
Sometimes, I hate getting good grades.
It's so overrated.
It's not like I'm a genius or anything, either.
It's just that this stuff comes easily to me.
At Winsor,
everyone cared about their grades,
and no one looked at you like
you were a leper if you got straight A's.
But here most of the kids
don't give a shit about school.
And the teachers don't seem to care.
All they do is keep telling these
shitty students how wonderful they are.
And they stick me in honors classes
so everyone hates me even more
than they already did,
if that's even possible.
It's totally uncool to be smart here.
The only thing people care about
is being popular.
You sure you want to go in there
by yourself?
- Yeah.
- I'll pick you up later.
No, I'll get a ride.
- I'll pick you up. It's no sweat.
- No, I'll get a ride.
- Hey, you forgot your coat.
- I'll be fine.
- It's cold.
- Good night. Bye.
Get...
Oh, my God! Here we go!
Hey! Have you seen my man? He's hot, huh?
- I love him! Come on.
- Here!
Stay here.
You look so good!
I'm so happy you're here. It's crazy!
Oh, yeah.
- Look at her go.
- I know.
What is that?
I don't know. Grain alcohol and something.
- If I drink this, I'm going to get wasted.
- Exactly, now drink!
- Come on!
- Okay.
Get away from me.
I don't want to talk to you.
- Hey, come on.
- Listen, listen, listen. Listen.
I just wanted to say sorry
for freaking you out that day by the locker.
I should have been more sensitive
about your mom and stuff,
but, I mean, I want things
to be the way they were before.
It's you. I wanna be with you.
- Okay, stop it!
- What is your problem?
- I can't do this, okay?
- So, you just cut it off?
- Whatever we had before is definitely over.
- Just like that?
Sorry.
You know, I thought you were different
from all the losers here, Sam!
I thought you were a risk-taker.
I thought you were different.
Where you been?
At that party.
- You been drinking?
- A little.
This smells like more than a little.
- I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.
- From partying?
- Why are you talking to me like this?
- Like how?
- Like a child.
- What else were you doing there?
- Talking, dancing, drinking a little.
- And?
And what? What are you asking me?
I can't deal with this right now, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I'm talking to you like a child,
because you're acting like one.
I'm not a child. I'm looking for my child.
Do you realize that we had no idea
who she was?
Maybe that's why she's gone, Ben.
Maybe she just wanted us
to understand her,
and maybe this is what I have to do
to get her back.
You know what?
You trusted her more than you trust me!
That is not true.
Yes, it is! You never used to interrogate her
when she came home
in the middle of the night.
That's because you were always the one
that did that.
Who do you see standing in front of you?
Who? Tell me!
Stop! Stop asking me that! I don't know!
I don't know!
So, you want me to live our daughter's life
but according to your rules?
Do you remember what it was like
to feel happy and sad and horny
all in the same second?
Do you know what this is like for me,
to have all these hormones
raging through my body all the time?
I'm not just living Sam's life, I'm feeling it.
Only I can't fucking get laid,
and I'm married!
I know the fucking feeling!
And no more parties for you, you hear me?
- What am I? A prisoner in my own house?
- No more!
Asshole.
Fuck.
I came here because I
can't talk to you at home.
You understand.
I just feel like I'm losing you again.
And I don't know what to do about that.
I need your help.
Can you help me?
Please, everyone, welcome our
newest member, Samantha Marris.
Okay. We really need to focus
on the student life section,
so I need everyone to shoot as much film
as they can over the next month.
Shots should be candid, okay?
Our goal is to get a picture of every student
in this school,
so start with your friends if you want,
and then you can go from there.
We'll meet next week, see what we got
and then assign the rest.
Now, this is where you can show me
your perspective,
how you see your life
as a high school student.
Capture on film something
you've never been able to verbalize.
Okay? See you next week.
What are you doing?
- Scared me.
- Sorry.
- What's that?
- Sam's diary.
You're writing in it?
- Let me take a look.
- No.
It's personal.
So I was thinking,
I need to start figuring out
where I'm going to apply to college.
You'd really go?
Don't you think I have to?
Oh, Williams is an excellent school.
You could stay at home and go there.
Yeah, but I think Sam was aiming
for Ivy League.
I think Williams is just as good
as any of those.
Yeah.
This isn't just about Sam, is it?
Ben,
I always put you and Sam first,
and I never put myself first.
And I gave up my education
so that you could have yours,
which was fine, but...
But now I'm getting a second chance.
- Are you saying that you have regrets?
- No.
No. Of course not.
- But everything is different now.
- Yeah.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
One, two, three...
- One, two, one, two, three...
- Jump.
...three, four, five, six, seven...
Yeah, that's great.
But you might wanna crop it here next time,
and you could sort of bring it and in.
Are you fucking crazy?
Maybe you think I'm stupid.
Really?
I didn't do that on purpose, I swear.
But I would get really...
You have a very distinctive
point of view, you're talented.
You really think so?
I want you to help me edit
the Student Life section.
Can we meet after school tomorrow?
Sam, don't take a picture of me.
I look like ass today.
You look like ass every day.
- Every day.
- I still don't get why you're doing this shit.
You know, those yearbook kids are freaks.
- More class!
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm Ben Marris, Samantha's father.
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah. You are?
- Ethan.
- Ethan. Right.
Right, Ethan, I just wanted to talk to you
about Samantha.
- What about her?
- I just wanna know, you know, what she's...
I mean, you know, how she's doing.
How's she doing?
- She's fine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- She dating anyone?
- I don't know...
- She doing... She doing drugs?
Look, I don't feel comfortable
talking to you about that,
- so I don't wanna discuss it.
- I understand that. I get that.
But I'm her father, you know. I'm a little
concerned, so I'd just like to know.
- She doesn't do drugs.
- At all?
Well, not since before the accident.
She's totally cleaned out,
but I wouldn't let anything happen to her.
I love Sam.
I'll do anything for her.
- What did you say?
- I love Sam.
Uh. You don't even know who she is, man.
- I know who she is.
- Do you even know what love is?
- I guess.
- Well, you think it's just the good stuff?
Life can throw some horrible shit
in your way,
and love is much more complicated
than that.
Love is being with someone
when things are hard, and staying.
Love is honesty and courtesy
and friendship and respect.
The first step towards loving someone
is not fucking them!
It's caring about them, that's how it starts.
Cool.
- I got to go.
- Ethan. Ethan, hold up.
- No, no, no, I got to go.
- Wait. Come here.
No, no.
Hi.
- Where's our daughter? It's been months.
- I don't know.
Where's my wife?
- I'm right here.
- No, you're not.
You haven't been here for a while.
I made a decision to be Sam,
because I couldn't be me.
It was too painful.
You seem to have
a pretty good handle on it.
I'm just as surprised as you are.
So, it doesn't even bother you anymore
that we can't be together.
Oh, that's not fair!
- Why are you taking money?
- Three months ago
you pulled away from me.
You have no idea what this is like for me.
- I've got 16-year-old boys...
- What do you need money for?
...rubbing up against me all day.
Believe me,
I have turned down my share of offers.
- So have I.
- You know what? This was your idea.
Yes, but I'm stuck.
I can't move forward, and I can't move back
as long as Sam's gone.
- I don't know...
- And I don't know how you can do this.
How you can just take her life
and forget about ours.
- This is still a marriage, you know.
- Oh, right.
- So I can't have a life?
- Very selfish.
- Right, everything...
- Let's talk about...
Everything was great
when I was just a housewife.
Well, according to Ethan,
you're having more of a life
- than you know about.
- You're checking up on me!
Yeah, because you don't talk to me.
You don't seem to realize
that I'm the outsider in all this.
I don't get to feel Sam the way you do.
Oh, you're looking for pity?
You're so fucking selfish.
You don't seem to understand.
If our daughter comes back,
where do you think I'm gonna go? Where?
Hannah.
Hey, Hannah.
Hannah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I doubted you. I just...
I just can't lose this family.
I have nothing without her.
We have this beautiful life together,
and it doesn't make any sense without you.
I feel like I'm going insane, Hannah.
I feel like I've gone insane.
Oh, please. I need you here with me.
Even if it means we have to live
like this always, I mean, I could do it.
I could learn how to live with it.
I swear I could figure it out.
It'd be all right 'cause I believe you.
You believe me?
You know, I've had 15 doors slammed
in my face today,
but my day doesn't begin
until you slam a door in my face.
Ha-ha.
Hannah? Come on.
Come on. Hannah!
Hannah!
Oh, my God.
We have been waiting.
- Come on.
- Get in here, get in here!
Ben!
- Hey.
- Maggie. Hi.
- Hi. It's been forever.
- How are you?
Oh, good, good. We're fantastic. Eric.
Have you guys seen Sam anywhere?
- No.
- No.
No, not around here. Is everything okay?
It's fine. No, it's just, you know,
kids being kids and all.
Have you checked with her friends?
Yeah. Oh, no,
I don't really know where they hang out,
so I just... That's why I've been...
Well, I think some of her friends hang out
at Bokeley Street.
- Yeah, that's right.
- 53 Bokeley Street.
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Okay, Ben,
hey, if you need anything, you know...
- Yes. Thank you.
...call us.
Yo, you guys ready?
- Hit this one.
- What the fuck?
Special K.
Like the cereal?
It's ketamine. You know, it's totally rad.
It makes you like hallucinate
and totally dissociate from your body.
You know, like,
it feels like you're like rising above it.
Oh, my God. I did it at a rave.
It was totally spiritual.
Crazy. Crazy.
Hello?
Hello?
- No, thank you. No, I don't want to.
- You sure? It's okay.
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Come on.
- Yo, it's the bomb. You got to try it.
- Come on.
Don't you want to take a break
from being you for a few hours?
All right! Yeah!
- How does this work?
- Okay, look...
There.
Do it hard, hard.
- Oh, my God! Help!
- What's happening?
- Hey, hey, hey...
- She's okay. Back up, back up!
Calm down!
Hey, what's going on? What's going on?
Why was she screaming?
- Tell me! Why... Why was she screaming?
- She just took a drug.
She's just having a bad trip.
- What drug did she take?
- She took ketamine.
And she'll be fine in like, like, 15 minutes.
- She'll be okay.
- She's not doing drugs, huh?
Did you give it to her? Who did?
- No one did.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Who did?
- I did, okay. Would you just...
Calm down!
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
- What are you doing in my room?
- Sam?
Sam, is that you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.
Dad, stop.
Dad, stop.
Dad, stop!
Did Mom clean my room?
You don't remember?
- Don't remember what?
- Anything.
- What?
- The accident.
You don't remember?
Where's Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom!
Mom? Mom!
Mom! Mom! Where is she?
Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
- Sam? Sam?
- Is she okay?
- Should we call an ambulance?
- No, she just fainted.
- Yeah, but what happened?
- It's nothing. It's really... It's just...
She had a nightmare.
She'll be fine, she just fainted.
Thank you. Thank you.
Did we sleep like this all night?
I think so.
I miss that.
Hannah?
Yeah?
Sam came back last night.
I know.
You know, if she saw you now,
she'd change her mind.
Keep reading.
"If Mom didn't marry Dad,
I wouldn't be here.
"I don't know, maybe if I could've seen
what she was like at my age.
"Truthfully, it's not like
any of my friends' parents are so great.
"Mom's always on my back.
"Taylor's mother doesn't give a shit
about her,
"so compared to her
I guess I got pretty lucky.
"I don't know why I have
such a hard time admitting this,
"but deep down I do love her.
"I mean, she's the only mom
I'll ever have, right?"
See that?
Ever since that night when she came back,
- I've been feeling her inside me.
- Like how, honey?
I don't know.
I can't explain it really. I just feel it.
It's like every day she's here,
she's becoming more pronounced.
She's coming back, Ben.
Sorry.
I'm not feeling very well.
I would... I'd like to reschedule this, please.
- That's it.
- Yeah.
I love you, Ben.
You're the love of my life.
I love you, too,
so much.
Say it.
I've looked into 15 pairs of eyes today,
but my day doesn't begin
till I look into yours.
Good morning, Sam.
Hi, Dad.
Do you...
Do you remember now?
The accident?
Your mother and I have a secret
we want to share with you.
It's from your mother.
I'll wait outside.
Hi, sweetheart.
I don't know
what your father has told you already,
but I wanted you to hear
something from me.
Remember when you said in the car
that I would never understand
what your life was like?
Well, you were right.
I wouldn't have ever even come close
to understanding.
But something happened
which I can't really explain,
but it's been incredible.
And I got to live your life for you
while you were gone.
And I got to feel what you feel
and go through
what you go through every day,
and I got to know your friends
and I got to know you.
And I think that you are a brilliant, beautiful,
intelligent girl,
and I want you to find whatever it is in life
that makes you happy, and go do it.
And I want you
to take care of your father for me.
He will... He will be okay,
but he needs you to help him get over this.
You made me want to be
a better person, Sam.
So, thank you.
And I love you more than anything.
I love you too, Mom.
Hey, what's up with your handwriting?
My mom wrote like this.
- You really miss her a lot.
- Yeah.
But I think she's still here somewhere.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come on, let's go.
Ice cream shop?
Come on,
ice-cream shizop?
Excellent.
