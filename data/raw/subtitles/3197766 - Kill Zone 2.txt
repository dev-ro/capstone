She's 4 months pregnant.
You want someone else?
Will that affect the organs?
An average of 620 people go
missing a year in Hong Kong,
without any omens.
They go to work and go to school as usual.
Then they disappear without a trace.
Are you alright?
l feel dizzy.
We found these bodies
in the South China Sea in 2006.
Their chests and abdomens
have been cut open.
Their hearts and livers have been removed.
They are later verified
as missing persons in Hong Kong.
Does the Boss know she's pregnant?
We believe
this organ trafficking cartel
has been running for 7 years.
As usual.

Saline on the left
drug pouch on the right.
Keep a close watch.
Don't wory.
The containers will
reach Thailand in 2 days.
l planted a mole inside a
possible smuggling cartel.
l'm confident we can lock the target soon.
Warden!
Examine the girl carefully.
The client will be here
in 2 days for surgey.

Daddy, you go first. No problem!
Hury! No problem!
l don't want to play anymore.
Don't be scared!
lt's fun! Look!
l don't want to play.
Come on, listen to Daddy.
One step at a time.
One step...
One step at a time.
Keep your eyes on the ice.
Don't be scared.
lt's easy.
Good iob!
Vey good!
Look at the ice, you're
like a little bird,
soaring in the sky.
Soaring...
Sa, you're going too fast!
Come here, Daddy!
Slow down!
Thanks!
Slow down!
Slow down!
Careful, Honey!
Sa!
Sa!
Bend down.
Who gave you permission to take her out?
The doctor.
l called him already, take
her upstairs right away!
Can you go faster? Doctor!
Doctor! Doctor!
Hury! Take her inside!
Hury!
We need to draw some blood!
How is she?
Sa, are you alright? Her
condition has stabilized.
But she only has 1/3 of
the normal platelet count.
l'll give her a new drug.
We'll see if she'll get better.
Any word on the bone marrow transplant?
We found a match, but were
unable to contact the donor.
lf we hear anything,
the hospital will call you.
Can you give me the donor's contact?
l can ty to call him.
l'm sory, l can't.
The donor's details are confidential.
l beg you, doctor!
You must be patient.
Chan Chi Kit
After evey setback
the pain intensifies.
l ask myself...
Sa!
Sa!
l had a dream.
About what?
l can't tell you.
Chai!
Why didn't you tell me
your daughter is sick?
You want to wait till she's dead?
Are we not brothers?
l'm sory!
l didn't realize the
new drug is so expensive.
Chai!
Sa is like a daughter to me.
What a shame she's so
sick at such a young age.
Over there!
What's your name?
Move!
Let go!
Go!
What are you doing?
Warden. This is the photo.
You were arrested in
2004 for drug possession.

You were sentenced to life imprisonment.
lt wasn't me.
lt wasn't me.
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Let go!
lt is now.
Get his fingerprints.

Unfortunately it's a mockey
endless lamenting
and sorrow in a world of indifference
The misfortune in life
will not leave me alone
After evey setback
the pain intensifies
You'll get fired if you keep this up.
You would have wasted eveyone's time.
Are you stupid or what?
Where are my smokes?
Look at me!
Look at me!
What the fuck?
What're you doing?
No!
No!
No!
No!
Look at you!
You call yourself a cop?
You said l talk like a fucking punk!
Now you want to know why
l don't look like a cop?
This is how l get the scoop.
You think they'd call and tell you?
l'm tying to kick it.
Just keep this under wraps.
Walk as fast as you can.
lt's OK, take it easy.
How much time do l have?
Will power is crucial.
There's hope as long as you're
on the list for heart transplant.
My blood type...
is the rare Bombay phenotype.
Less than...
one in a million.
lf anything goes wrong,
we can give you an artificial heart
that can last 5 years.
When will l find a heart?
Your brother's report is out.
He has the same blood type.
HLA 1000/o.
Ne_ week
we go to Thailand.
l'll get you an electronic heart.
The experts say it can last 5 years.
Yours is a 1000/o match for me.
l can't have surgey all the time.
You're my brother.
We grew up together.
You love me
and provided for me.
We're brothers!
l know you won't do it.
l trust you won't.
l need your help this afternoon.
We have an order
to kidnap 2 people.
Husband and wife.
Bring me the bag from the reception.
Your singing sucks! Let me do it.
Stop it!
Again!
Bingo!
They want me to kidnap someone right now.
Where?
Don't know yet.
But they have guns.
l'll track your phone.
Stall them until we get there.
Kit!
Run if it goes sour.
We must go now, OK?
Someone will take us onto the boat.
We'll be fine.
l'll kill him if he so
much as touches your hair.
The cruise terminal? The nerve of them!
Go over there!
Yes, sir!
Zone A!
Chief!
lt's them!
Keep the man alive.
Take him on the boat.
Kill the woman.
Take her out.
They're here! Be careful!
Sit down!
l don't care what...
arrest them if they make a move.
Attention please...
Shoot!
l said shoot!
Don't wory, get up!
Make sure it doesn't go off!
l can't die!
Didn't we pay you?
Loser!
Run! Hury!

He's still in a coma.
His name is Hung Man Biu.

He's an anesthetist at Mercy Hospital.
Three shots to the chest led

The doctor will operate when
his condition stabilizes.
Excuse me.
My name is Hung Man Kong.
You asked me to come in to give blood.
Please follow me.
Thanks.
Where is our mole?
On a boat, with the rest of them.
We can still track them down.
We're on the right track.
This guy...
So many people want him dead,
when he wakes up,
we'll know what's going on.
The doctor said you have a weak heart,

l want to get him a lamer.
What do you do?

How is your relationship
with your brother?
He donated blood several times
to save my life.
Before he got married,
we used to live together.
We're vey close.
Close?
Your number is not in his phone book.
My phone number is...
98721018
18th October 1972
is my birthday.
The number is easy to remember.
We're brothers,
my number need not be in his phone book.
Nice number.
Yes.
He gave it to me.
Sir!
Phone call for you.
Excuse me.
Open up!
Sir!
l have your boy Chan Chi Kit.
Trade him with Hung Man
Biu if you want him back.
You have two days.
lf l don't see him, l'll
chop your boy to pieces.
Who's this? Hello?
You won't save a cop in trouble?
l never said that.
But l can't lose the suspect.
We can't take that chance.
Or our effort for years
will go down the drain!
l didn't want a fellow
cop to get hurt either.
He wasn't iust a cop.
He's my nephew.
l am Police.
l...l am a Hong Kong Police.
l am a Hong Kong Police.
Who can help me?
l can pay! l can give money!
Kwong came to me a week ago.
You need money because
your daughter is sick.
lf you need more, we'll
talk again at month end.
Take good care of your daughter.
Sa!
You know what Police means?
Daddy, give me your phone.
Here!
l downloaded an app for you.
Police.
Police.
Donator.
Clash with Police

Where is the boat?

Where is the boat?
You're out of line!
Tell me! Help! Help!
What did l tell you?
No news, we can't sit here and wait.
Tell me what to do!
No, you tell me what to do!
l don't want you to lose your pension.
We can't find the boat or my nephew.
l'd rather lose my job
than lose my nephew.
Hello? How are you?
Can you hear me? Can you save my daughter?
Who's this?
You speak Thai?
l don't understand.
Wait a minute.
Please wait.
What do you want?
What the fuck is this?
Hey! What do you want?
Don't move!
Hey! What do you want?
l tell you. Don't move!
Tell him only he can
save my daughter! Hury...
Don't play with the phone! l'm hanging up!
Hello? Please hold.
Tell him what?
Only he can save my daughter.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Global Translator
My daughter has leukemia.
This guy's bone marrow can save her.
He can save my daughter.
l hope he can come to Thailand.
l beg you, please help my daughter.
Are you the owner of this phone?
Or are you a friend?
Listen to me...
There's a girl who has leukemia.
l'm not the owner of this phone.
l fished it out of the water.
Are you the owner?
There's no sound. Is it broken?
What happened?
Hold on! Don't hang up!
What did he say?
He said...
it's not his phone.
He iust found it.
How old is your daughter?
How old is your daughter?
She's 8.
Are you sick? What's wrong with you?
Headache.
ln that case, we must operate.
Don't laugh! Take this seriously!
Do l really need surgey?
Yes!
Nurse, please look after her
Daddy! How are you, doctor?
Can you give me a check-up?
My heart is beating vey fast.
Your patients are waiting for you.
We're pretending.
Really?
Daddy, l have a secret.
What?
The doctor found someone who can save me.
l copied down his phone number.
Where?
lf we find him, l'll get well.
Don't wory, Daddy! We'll find him.
Can you promise not to tell anyone?
l promise! l'll zip it up.
l'll get well.
l will.
Your brother's operation went well.
He'll wake up soon.
When he wakes up, he can
tell me who wants him dead.
You have cigarettes?
Here!
Thanks!
Hopefully he can help you with your case.
l hope so too.
The nurse said you have a weak heart.
You should quit smoking.
That can cure my
condition but not my life.
The hell with it!
Well said!
When l was 7 years old,
the doctor said l won't live to 10.
When l was 10,
he said l won't get past 15.
l'm 43 years old now.
Many doctors said it's a miracle.
My pacemaker...
used to run on 2 batteries.
Now they use a chip.
lf it stops,
l die instantly.
For over a decade,
l've been waiting for a heart.
You have a vey rare blood type.
Not even one in 10 million.
Does your brother know about this?
Yes!
ln this whole world,
only your brother's heart can save you.
Go upstairs with me.
l got a clip today,
l don't know if it's real.
l'm scared after watching it.
My life...
is bound to his.
lf l die,
you'll never see him again.
My heart will stop if
l don't get a new one.
Bust my brother out of the hospital.
Your boss is on his way.
Time is running out.
What a selfless cop!
OK...
Take it easy!
Where? Corridor.
What?
Bring the car to the back door.
Clean out the trunk.
Why?
Don't ask!
Check out cell #15.
Brother Kwong, cell #15!
They came for the suspect!
Open the door! They came for the suspect!
Hury!
Open the door!
l need to take the suspect with me.
Wheelchair!
Wheelchair!
Get up slowly!
Control to Zone A, is eveything OK?
Yes, over!
What happened?
The prisoner escaped!
We're dead! Let's split
up and look for him.
Clear!
What are you doing here?
Stay where you are!
What the fuck?
Drive!
Brother Wah!
We don't have to do this. We can go back.
How? A cop's life is at stake.
So what if we hand over the suspect?
lf they don't release
him, we'll all go to jail!
We have no choice!
Did you go out last night?
A new bar iust opened.
The girls are beautiful.
What the fuck?
What happened?
What happened?
Go to Cell #69!
Right away!
lt's open! Let's go!
Quick!
Who is it?
Stop!
You saw nothing, iust walk away.
Get them back
or you'll spend the rest
of your life in here.
What are you doing?
Go back to your room!
Women and children? Why are they here?
None of your business!
He took my phone.
We're dead if he makes a call.
Come back!
Take him to Wong Shek Pier.
Listen.
l won't hand him over.
lf anything happens to my nephew,
l'll carve out his heart!
l'm telling you...
you and your nephew are dead.
Move away!
Who told you to open fire?
You're all dead if
anything happens to them.
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!
Don't shoot! Hold your fire!
Move!
Kit!
Kit!
Kit!
ls that him?
Trace the location of
the phone in Thailand.
l'll do it.
Give me 2 days.
l don't think God will toy with us.
Lee Tai Yun!
Lee Tai Yun! Open the door!
Are we friends?
Will this work?
l don't know.
Why don't you call the ambulance?
Don't fucking kill him! We need him alive!
Yes Sir!
l won't let my nephew
get hurt. Give me 3 days.
Shit!
Brother Wah. l got it.
The call is from a prison in Bangkok.
Our guy may be inside. Please be careful.
Hello?
What is it?
l followed you here from the prison.
What do you want?
l want to see someone.
Sa!
Well?
No answer!
Daddy!
l'm scared.
Sa, look at this little plant...
before it starts to germinate,
it's only a seed buried in the soil
in complete darkness.
lt doesn't know what
its future will be like.
Just like you and me.
We're both scared.
That's why we must have hope.
Just like the seed in the dark soil.
As long as it doesn't give
up, germinate and grow,
it will see sunlight someday.
The world is full of miracles.
We must have hope.
Smile!
Thank you!
Sweetie?
ls the baby cying again?
Yes.
Where have you been?
Mom and Dad are waiting for you.
Can you manage?
When will you be home?
Why two of you?
We have a lot to unload.
Open up...
Follow me!
Someone wants to see you.
Sir, we traced them to Dr. Lee Tai Yun
148 Reclamation Street in Yau Ma Tei.
What are you doing?
Do you know?
You'll get us killed!
Trust me! It'll be alright!
Uncle!
Kit!
Uncle! Kit!
Take it easy!
Uncle! Kit!
Stand still!
Kit!
You have 15 minutes!
15 minutes only.
Take cover!
Watch him.
When are you getting me out?
l need to make sure you're in here,
then l'll get you out.
l have the culprit's brother.
They wouldn't dare touch you.
Take this money,
take your daughter away.
l shouldn't have gotten you this iob.
Brother Wah!
We're screwed.
They took the suspect.
What is it?
Big Mouth is in trouble.
The culprit abducted his brother.
l came alone.
Kit!
Look at me.
We'll get through this.
One step at a time,
we can do it.
Uncle!
Do we have a way out?
l'll get you out even if l
have to blow up this place.
Tell me...
How can l get him out?
Money is not an issue.
Tell me!
You're working vey hard.
Making a delivey at this hour?
l let you in because we're like brothers.
How could you do this to me?
Sory, Boss!
Good!
lf l'm still your boss,
l'm giving you a chance
to take care of him.
But l won't force you.
Sa?
We checked this girl's blood type.
l can save your daughter.
HLA 1000/o Matched.
lf you won't do it,
l'll sell this girl to someone else.
She's your last hope.
l'll do it.
No...
No...No
A dead man is worthless.
You're here!
Thanks to you!
Or l won't be here so fast.
Thank you!
Don't mention it, Mr. Hung.
lf you hadn't saved me back then,
l won't be here today.
Nice tie!
Thank you.
Did you hear that?
He thanked me.
Did you hear that?
Cops are not the only ones
who can be selfless.
You want to kill your own brother.
You're worse than a dog.
How many lives have l saved?
Do you have any idea?
He's alive...
because of me.
Or else...
they already fed him
to the dogs in Cambodia.
l take one life
to save my own.
What's wrong with that?
He...
is my brother.
What's between us,
is none of your business.
My life has been tough
but l still came this far.
Look at you!
You had it easy,
but you don't appreciate it
and end up bleeding all over the place.
Look at you...
So pathetic!
You sound more and more like a mad dog.
Except for me,
eveyone is afraid to die.
Tell you what...
l'm sending you on your way.
What an amul mess!
Consider this a gift.
Go ahead and sell them.
Thank you!
Surgey has been scheduled.
We can start when your brother gets here.
Call me when you're ready.
Make it quick.
Hello, l came to pick up the phone.
Did you bring money?
Yes!
Thank you!
lt's working. You're all set.
Thank you!
Your phone kept ringing.
Look at that!
Sa, where are you going?
l want to be alone. It's a secret.
Hello?
Did you call me?
l have a lot of missed calls.
Excellent! l finally got ahold of you!
What are you saying?
Bye!
The man called me!
What is going on?
Money?
Sa, this is your godfather.
Your Daddy is working.
Let him finish working, OK?
l'll tell him to call you later.
We're leaving.
Thank you.
l told you
not to wear that when you eat.
Relax! Let's eat.
Let's break out of here!
Uncle!
Let's go!
Take them away!
Right!
Get in!
There's a car!
They're not here.
lt'll work.
Run!
Run!
Chai!
What a moron.
What a moron!
What happened to you?
Give us a hand!
Hury!
Call Hong Kong.
We're going back tonight.
Oh my God!
What is it?
The girl has leukemia!
Only the owner of the phone can save her.
lt'd be great if he would go to Thailand.
You understand that?
You bet!
What is that? Who sent it?
He's not the owner of the phone.
l found this picture in the phone.
Maybe he's the owner.
He's sending me a picture of the owner.
What?
Where can l make a long distance call?
Excuse me!
These belong to your
friends, please keep them!
Thank you!
Daddy, where are you?
l got through to his
phone, he sent me a picture.
l'm sending it to you now.
Nurse! Where are you?
Sa! Come here!
Nurse!
l found him!
The man who can save me.
l have his picture, that's him!
That's him! That's him!
That's him! That's him!
Why do you have my photo?
We have assured you that
your bone marrow can save Sa.
But at this time, we are
unable to accept your donation.
Why?
By law, any drug user must quit
for a minimum period of three
years before giving any donation.
However,
l don't think her condition could
withstand for another six months.
l'm sory!
l have done something bad in the past.
l can't help you iust yet.
What if l wait for you?
l promise l'll live till
the day you can save me
l'm sure you can.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Hit him hard!
Harder! What's wrong with you?
You have a last wish?
l want...
...you dead.
l can't help you with that.
Start the surgey.
l can't believe
the guy who can save Sa
is your nephew.
lf you believe
you can keep on going.
God will not toy with us.
Someday
when you look back, you'll know...
the wrong thing
happens at the right time.
Call the doctor!
l gave you the money you needed.
You needed someone to save your daughter,
l found one for you.
You think you have done a good deed?
Hope...
you won't get it evey day.
You killed your own daughter.
Chop him up and feed him to the dogs.
Yes, sir!
Hold this!
Hury!
Mr. Hung?
You're not in surgey?
Get over here!
What happened?
Bring the guy and get over here!
You should have the address!
Catch him!
Hury!
Stop!
Good evening.
Sa?
Where's Sa?
Find him!
Right!
Open it!
Open it!
Open it!
l told you to open it.
Moron.
Open it slowly.
What're you looking at?
Mask!
Can you promise me something?
Give this to Daddy!
Let the Boss go,
l'll let your friend go.
Turn on the lights and lock the elevator.
l'm the guy from Hong Kong
you've been looking for.
Sa!
Daddy, he sent me a picture.
l'm sending it to you now.
lt's Me!
l won't make it.
Without a doctor,
your heart is useless to me.
lf you were not my brother,
l would have done this over 10 years ago.
l have no choice.
But you do.
Go!
Hury!
Don't go!
lf you leave, l'll die!
Are you alright?
l can't see a thing!
Too bright.
Sa!
Sa!
Where will l go?
Don't be afraid!
You will be fine.
You can't die!
You need to save my daughter!
l heard they looked
for me for a long time.
Luckily they found me in the end.
A lot of things in life
are beyond our control.
Just like the ice on the lake.
No one knows when the ice will crack.
l never told anyone
what happened that night.
Because no one would believe
there's a wolf in Bangkok.
l'll never forget the
way the wolf looked at me.
Daddy taught me to deal with fear
and have hope.
Don't let go
Don't let me down
l know it's far away
l'll cary you
Till l can't go on
Holding in the pain
l'll still cary on, l'll still cary on
