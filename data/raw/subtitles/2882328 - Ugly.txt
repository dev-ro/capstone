Inspired by true events.
- Did Papa call?
- No.
UGLY
Every 5 minutes, police interrupts
our shoot, asking for bribe.
- Do you have legal shooting permits?
- We do, sir!
We have already paid the fees, both
to the municipality and the police.
But this is the detection squad,
not a complaint office.
- I need to go in.
- Who are you?
Siddhant.
I am the brother in law of Mr. Bose
who is the chief of detection squad.
- What is your reason?
- It's personal. Ask Mr. Gupta.Ask him, he knows me.
Sir!
Sir!
Sir, when people
buy mobile SIM cards...
...or when they go
through immigration....
Or check into a hotel, they need to
fill in their personal details.
We acquire all those details/intel and
feed into our system.
Passport numbers, social security number,
...
... mobile, license, car numbers...
...all such unique numbers are regularly
collated & updated in our systems.
So, if you need any intel on anyone....
Your brother-in-law.....!
... We don't need to sift through various
offices for their records anymore.
Without moving, we just need to send subject's
unique number by by SMS...
... and within 15 minutes, maximum half an hour at most
...
... You can get all intel on that
person on your phone itself.
Mummy, check with Papa when
is he coming to pick me up.
- It's your father, do it yourself..
- But i can't get through to him..
Hey, don't.
- Let me clean up...
- No, just leave.
Why did you break the jug?
Because you're not calling Papa, always watching television.
I told you to call  dad.
Will you shut up? I'll not allow you to go
out with him?
You do nothing,
watching television alone.
- Want to meet your father?
- Yes, that's what I want.
Well shut up. It's over.
- Hello.
- Kali?
- Get your mother.
- Hold on...
<I> - Mummy, uncle's calling for you.
- Hello.. </ i>
I'm on my way.
Hello,listen i will drop in for a bit but
i will leave quickly.,okay?
Today i have to take Kali to watch cartoon.
Kali, wait.
Kali, wait!
Honey...
Tell me,do i smell bad ?
Still? Is it better? i spray a little.
Well? tidy your hair.
I am waiting outside for half an hour.
Everyone is laughing at me
becaus they know who I am... his brother-in-law.
They do not even care.
He must be busy.
That casting director calls me
only on Saturdays! ..when I'm suppose
to meet my daughter.
Don't be reckless.
<I> I'll speak to him. </ i>
Dad. At last!
Please speak to him, man! This is not fair.
Fucking bitch!!
She treats me like i'm going to kidnap my own daughter!
- Dad, bad words... 10 rupees.
- Dude,i am on the way, I cann't go faster.
- Dad....!
- It's Mumbai's traffic.
What did you say?
Are you still there?
Good joke,dude.
Why do married indian women have a red
dot on their forehead?
Because they're recording
everything...!! It's a fucking recording button, dude.
I should've been there, man.Am I missing something?
You're stupid to give him money, Papa?
I want to know why you gave him money.
I don't. I don't even speak to my son.
I don't even pay his rent.
You don't but your wife does.
It is wise to keep one's
woman on a leash.
Women
is better to have them monitored.
Wait a moment, your daughter's on the line..
What is it?
-Yes, he is sitting down.So?
Shalini,Shalini, I didn't marry you to solve
your family problems...
Either I've to intimidate
your father's business associates......
...or illegally bail your brother and his friends from night club's incidents.
So, you just need him to be  arrested.
You do wait outside.
That must hurt their feelings,
and they will  stop calling.
I'll thrash him so hard that he'll
forget how to dial a fucking phone..
...you go have your
drink and  don't call me.
Wait.
I need some money.
Why?
Ask Vinayak, he'll bring whatever you want.
I have no one rupee.
Even my account is empty.
I get bored sitting at home...
There are always five liters of gasoline in your car.
If you want any other things, ask Vinayak to get.
Stop bothering me.
Rane.
- Hello.
- Give me your phone.
Serves tea for His Highness.
SATURDAY
Why have we stopped here, Papa?
Just 5 minutes,
I've to pick a script.
Oh, no!
Just 5 minutes. Please!
I know how long your 5 minutes are!
Aren't we going to IMAX at 5, okay?
- What time is it now?
- 3 o'clock.
3 o'clock! The movie will start at 5 o'clock.
What will we do for next 2 hours?
I may as well do a small work.
I do not care.
Why do you always pick me when you've work to do..
Come with me, then.
No. Do what you have to do
and don't bother coming back.
Wow! An iphone...!
Great. Who gave it to you?
Uncle gifted it to me.
Which model is it?
Now why are you wasting time?
I'm going, dear.
Don't get mad!
Do not make a mess here,
okay?
Stay right here.
I'll be back soon, OK?
Yeah, whatever. Go.
That's like my girl.
Now go!
- Well, you'll stay here, huh?
- Yeah.
But if I told you!
Your son will be here in 5 minutes...
Come on, you're exaggerating!
I'm auditioning for
a big film tomorrow.
If the Goddess smiles on me,
I'll get the role!
Then I'll pay you back...
...all together!
Brother-in-law, you could profit Rs 5,000 for iPhone...
... and 6,000 rupees for iPad
in the black market.
So if we get 100 pieces per trip,
that's an easy 500,000 rupees.
If you manage the custom officers,
your profits grow.
My brother-in-law is upstairs..
He Is trafficking iPhones now.
Give him a lesson as if dare to do it again.
Hello?
Where are you?
Arrived now, open the door.
- You really made me wait!
- You know how the traffic is...!
Let me see the script.
- This is seriously long monologue.
- Just memorise it.
Why is Kali not in the car?
- What?
- yes,your car's door was open.I closed it myself.
What are you saying?
- She must be around somewhere...
- What's up? Rahul!
Hey, Rahul!
Rahul!
Rahul!
Rahul, wait!
Rahul!
Sir,

- There was a  little girl...
- I saw nothing.
Sir, you saw?
- In this car.
- No.
There was a little girl there.
Do not you see?
Did you see a little girl in that car?
Your phone is ringing.
Respond.
Hey, let me see!

Where did you find this phone?
- Hey, Rahul... over here!

- What... what?
Let me go.
Catch him.
<I> Stop, idiot </ i>
Catch him, Rahul!
Continues, goes up!
Follow him around,
I'll take the stairs.
Catch the bastard!
<I> - full name?
- My name is Rahul Kapoor </ i>
Var... Varshney?
Why is your last name written as 'Varshney' here?
That's my real name...
but I prefer to use 'Kapoor'!
Why?
-Sir, he's an actor.
- Let him answer.
Actors do this often, sir.
- What?
- A real name and a screen name.
- Why?
And what is the "real name"
of Amitabh Bachhan?
He hasn't, but--
Why not? He is a big star.
A great actor.
- Yes, but there are others...
- There are several.
Like Akshay Kumar's real name is Rajiv Bhatia.
Rajesh Khanna called himself Jatin.
Yes, that's true. Akshay
Kumar's real name is Rajiv Bhatia.
- Even Dilip Kumar's real name was Yusuf, right?
- Yusuf...
- it's Yusuf Khan.
- Ahh....Yusuf Bhai.
- Yusuf Bhai.
- Jeetendra also had one...
- Correct.
"Ravi Kapoor."
Just look at him drool...
...this bastard's such a movie buff!, right?
Well, Kapoor, tell us,
which film have you acted in?
I haven't! until now.
So what are you waiting for?
Sir, he's waiting for a right role...
He trained as an actor.
- And you, what do you do?
- I am... casting director and producer.
What is "Casting"?
Its cast.
See, when a film is launched,...
... I select the actors for it.
So you decide whether to take
Shahrukh Khan or Salman Khan...?
No, sir...!
See, all the big stars...
Shahrukhs and Salmans...!
Yeah, the stars who play main leads.
Actually, they are chosen advance.
But the heroine's mother, her father...
- The 'character roles', sir...
Or the villain's henchmen...
The bad guys who get beaten up...!
So basically,
you select the extras.
So why haven't you cast
your friend yet?
Sir, he only wants to play the hero...
he wants to become a star.
But he is a hero already, right?
Yeah, he is very good!
Oh, he's a 'big hero'! He
leaves a little kid alone in the car.
- She is 10 years old.
- Why were you driving around with her??
- I visit her every Saturday.
- Why? Does her mom work on Saturdays?
We're Divorced.
See now, that's the real problem!
It's not simple!
Divorce..
They can't keep a marriage and......
...we end up cleaning their mess!
Good, continue...!
She was with me.
Did you inform the mother that
you were leaving her kid alone?
Did you ?
Look, he asked me to come over...
To give me the script.
- Okay.
So, I parked the car and
asked Kali to wait inside.
- I went up to his place, he wasn't there.
- You noting this down?
Yes, sir.
Continue..
His parents were home,
so I waited there.
Then he arrived...
and asked about Kali.
I said 'she's in the car'.
He said 'she isn't'.
- I ran down and he also followed me.
- I followed.
She was really gone.
So I started looking everywhere.
Suddenly he called out to me...
he had caught a guy!
I ran upto him
expecting he's found a clue...
That guy pushed him, escaped and got
hit by a car. Now how's this our fault, sir?
Yes, of course.
My daughter's gone missing, sir...
Shouldn't you be looking for her
instead of questioning us...?
Hello! This is not your performance..
And stop telling
me how to do my job'?
Go teach someone else!
Why did you call him?
Sir... l... called him over to
give the audition script, sir.
But when he came home,
my computer wasn't working...
How is that connected to your
fucking computer, now?!
Just give him the damn script...
why drag your computer into it?
Script is sent over email, right?
- So, he had to go to a cyber cafe.
- Sir, I...
You had to print the script from an
email in a cyber cafe. Just say that!
So I returned with the script copy...
and went home.
Rahul parked in front of my house.
I saw his car below.
- I saw the car and then...
- ...you came upstairs.
No, I noticed he's not in the car.
I assumed he's gone up to my place.
I approached and asked him
"Where is Kali?"
But how did you know the
girl's supposed to be in the car?
I had told him over the phone, sir...
that Kali was with me..
So why didn't you tell us
this before?
- You both have different versions...
- No, sir...
Do you think you're doing a movie?
This is a police station.
Anyway, I came up and asked Rahul.
I asked  "Where is Kali?''
He answered " In the car "
I said,".. No, she's not there "
He immediately ran down
and I followed him.
He looked in the car and then..
...we split up to look in the market.
So let's say this is the car...!
He had parked his car and...
Damn these fucking daily mobile jokes...
You continue.
So he looked in the car... then
I ran this way, and..
and he ran that way.
- So towards Punjab Hotel?
- Yes
A guy was standing a little ahead
so I asked him...
"Did you see a seven-nine years old girl?"
He wasn't answering my question
but his phone kept ringing.
And it was still ringing,
and i said, "Answer your call"
What's it to you...?
Shouldn't you focus on the girl?
Sir, won't you ask me to take my call
if it keeps ringing?
Okay, go ahead.
so the guy took the call.
So he took the call,
and I saw it was this iphone...!
- An iPhone?
-...... an iPhone, this one.
- This mobile?
- Yes. I said that.
Rahul's pic flashed on the screen,
And I realised it's Kali's phone.
Because i was calling her, right?
- He was...!
- Wait.You're saying his pic flashed on the phone?
- Yes, sir.
What is this?
That's impossible!
Sir, when I call her, my pic appears
with 'Papa Calling'...!
How? "Papa" what?
You see my face with
'Papa calling'...!
Oh, that's so precious!
I've called my daughter several times
from my phone......
... but I've never seen 'Papa calling' in my life.
Obviously, you'll have to save it first...
- Save what?
- It'll flash only when you have saved
your photo on your daughter's mobile!
Otherwise, it does not work.
Sir, you'll need a
phone camera for that.
Your cell phone is a crap. man!
Hey, can't you see the camera?
You think we're stupid?
- Wait, allow me, sir. First, you take a photo...
- Correct.
Then you save it.. .
- so when the phone rings.....
- my face will flash on my phone!
Let me show you...
switch on your camera, please!
I'm still confused...!...
- So now when we take your photo...
- Taking my picture?
- We need your photo, right?
- Then it'll flash on my phone...!!
No!! If the photo's taken on this
phone, it'll flash here... not there!
Once your snap is saved
whoever calls you from this phone.........
Oh, fuck it...!
Just take my snap.
- Sir, your cap!
- Oh, yes... wait!
- What a circus!
- Ready?
Where does Shrilal live..
...the man who makes the masks and selling masks?
- Masks?
- You know him?
No.
- Shrilal lives here?
- Yes.
- Who else lives here?
- Just me.
- What is your name?
- Uma Devi.
- And what is that?
- I make masks for kids.
- This is what Shrilal sells.
- For children?
-Yes
- Does he like little kids?
- I do not know.
We received a complaint.
You and he are doing something wrong
with children.
No, no.
- Are you sure?
- I know nothing about that..
What about Shrilal?
Has police ever arrested him?
No.. but some people beat him up once
because ...
...he gave a little girl an ice lolly.
- A little girl?
- Yes.
Are you dialing or meditating...?
I no longer have balance.
Tell me the number.
- 9821...
- The home number, man!
- Doesn't she have a landline?
- Yes...
It's 2345...
-... 42 67.
- 42 6...
... 7.

The market was crowded, sir.
Nobody saw anything.
But we found some of her things.
- Have you checked it?
- Yes, sir.
Note.
A couple of people did see her
but no one remembers anything...
No one knows how he found the phone.
He used to sell toys and
lived with his aunt in these slums.

The market was so crowded
that the dog lost her trace, sir.

Then you assured me

- Now,suspect me i kidnapped my dayghter?
- Correct.
Think before you speak, inspector.
What? Are you calling me nonsensical?
I have no sense?
You kidnapped because sir's wife

No, why?
In fact, you're making a fool of us.
- Fully confused.

He learned something that happened
between his friend and me.
Did you see where I grew up?
Even if you become a star...
... you can never give me a house like that.
you choose to believe your
friend over me?
I asked you a question.
Your friend tried to fuck me...
I didn't let him.
I think you've something going on
with him...
 He never questioned his friend.... </ i>
You want to hit me...?
Come on, hit me!

Smart ass, it took us 30 minutes to
figure you've changed your SIM card!
Do you understand?
Do you see this number?
See? Your phone's registry
number is a unique number...
WeThat helped us trace you.
-I called because...
- Why?
to save Rahul from.....your boss' personal agenda.
Does this feel personal, motherfucker?
- What's the point of hitting me, sir?
- No, you got me?
I am telling the truth.
i did not invent anything.
You're tied naked in front of me...
...and you're getting cheeky with me?
I'll fucking beat you to pulp!!
- Follow your motto...
- What motto?
"The policeman is your friend."
"Friend?"
Do you think we're friends, asshole?
Patnaik, did you hear that?
Think we're your friends,
motherfucker?
We are friends of honest people,
not fucking thugs!
Why did you go to your office?
Why?
I had to repay a loan...!
You have money, huh? No, do not.
Then why call?
Why'd you call the fucking accountant
when you're broke as hell?
Updates on the gang shoot out
case from south?
Yesterday We've found 4 unique numbers.
Why are they unique?
We cross checked them.
The main suspect used these four numbers on the site.
Weren't you going to get the money
through ransom...?
By kidnapping the girl, right...?
Confess, motherfucker!
His cellphone  is ringing.
Give it to me.
Answer.
Hello... Hello.
Hello, Chaitanya?
Where...? Where are you?
<I> When you left,
Bose beat me so much.</ i>
<I>I am going to the press.
I am outside the headquarters of CNN-IBN </ i>
Hello? Chaitanya?
- Your friend kidnapped your daughter.
- Rahul, it's a lie!
<I> Rahul, he is lying. </ i>
Didn't you call from the railway station...
and ask for a million as ransom?
<I> Not really.</ i>
Confess.
We were all together yesterday.
You forced him to do this, right?
Why else will he ask for ransom
when he knows you're watching me...?
He pays my rent.
Know I have no money.
So play this game with
someone else, Bose.
Let me find my daughter.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
You want to find Kali,
so do I and so does the police.
She's your daughter
as much as mine...!
If you go to the press we have no
chance of finding her alive. Got it?
MASALA MANTAR WISH YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Just stay silent.
We'll find her.
The foods are on my behalf.
Son of a bitch!
Pretending to be Kali's father.
She is still missing and he doesn't care.
He has probably hidden her himself...
... so i cannot see my daughter.
You are talking like him,too.
- Feeds us after breaking our teeth.
- Forget It, Rahul.
Screw him, man!
He hit me so hard in front of
all those fucking people...!
See...?
Who will cast me now?
Like I got VIP
treatment inside, right?
The motherfucker will pay
for every scar on my face!
I know what I have to do now.
There's no ransom call in
80 percent kidnapping cases!
And I've seen Kali's photo...
She is very cute, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
MISSING Kali Varshney
You can continue.
- Who's kid is this?
- She's my girl, sir.
Ther are specialized gangs who usually pick up fair skinned
kids as they have a big market here...
Those that sell better
in India.
Foreigners prefer darker complexion.
<I> Nobody buys a 10 year old girl
</ i>
- Wake her up..
- She is sick.
-Come on, get up.
Hello?
Hey, what's her name?... catch him.
TUESDAY
This girl was kidnapped in broad daylight...
...from a maroon Lancer in Andheri.
Sir, i stole a child long ago.
But now I'm reformed.
Why did I come?
If it was you or not,
i  do not know.
It's your job to find her.
And if you do not find
her in 24 hours...
... you and everyone will die.
Watch her face throughly.
40 girls is auditioned,
all with the same script.
<I> Dad, come and get me </ i>

</ i>
 Keep them ready.I'll call tomorrow.
'... In the fields seize me
in the grass tease me...'
Hold me tightly
I will make you shudder
You're getting a call from abroad...!
A 401?
Who could it be?
- Who could it be?
- He beat you real bad, huh?
That's why I say one should
marry carefully.
Like you married very wisely...!
Hello.
<I> Dad, I beg you, come get me </ i>
- Hello..
<I> - I miss you so much </ i>
Hello.....? Kali?
<I> I'm having youir daughter </ i>
<I> Get two million
if you want to see her alive </ i>
<I>I will give you 24 hours </. i>
<I> And if you notify the police or whoever...
</ i>
... I'll
leave her chopped parts where I found her! </ i>
<I> No negotiation, whatsoever!
without a rupee less </ i>
You
will do exactly what I tell you </ i>
 Did you understand </ i>
Why the voice
is so distorted?
Sir, it's recorded.
The kidnapper's placed the phone
on the speaker and played a recording.
Hello.
Where are you?
Chaitanya and Rahul.
I got the call...!
<I>I heard Kali's voice.
He's asking for 2 million...!
</ i>
Who?
- How the heck do I know?
- The kidnappers, obviously.
- Are you with Rakhi?
- Yeah, she's with me!
<I> How will I get 2 million? </ i>.
- You could... ask your ex father-in-law.
- I will not ask anything from that asshole.
Put your ego aside, emotional fool!
How will you get 2 million?
<I> You should talk to him.
He'll either find the money or the girl!.. </ i>
... he will recover.
He will do nothing,
only play the hero.
And the kidnapper will kill my daughter.
Why aren't you here, man?
<I> I can not.
I'm a little busy right now...! </ i>
Upadhyay?
Yes, sir?
Find out who's the girl with them.
- Okay!
Where's Rahul right now?
At home, sir.
One of our constables is
already positioned there.
- And Chaitanya?
- In his office, sir.
- And the ransom call?
- We're still trying to trace it.
It's an overseas call... from where
that gangster Pujari used to call!
But he is in prison now.
- But his men are still out...!
-Anyone could be working for him..
Ma'am?
.. have you informed sir
you're stepping out...?
He's forbidden your going out
without permission...!
At least send a message.
<I> Well, Pujari </ i>
<I> I hear your men are
operating from abroad now? </ i>
<I> Come on, sir, how will they go abroad
when I myself haven't. </ i>
How come you used to call from
outside the country?
I do not know, sir.
After you tortured me...
... I've lost all memory.
Want to call home?
Yes, it's been a while...
Here... it's yours!
Unlimited Balance.
- So what's up?
- A girl was kidnapped.
-Your daughter?
- The daughter of someone important?
- Yes
-So, this is why you are generous!
I have something else to ask.
I get damn bored here!
I would like a small TV,
and a DVD player...
... to watch movies or listen to songs.
- Done.
-Oh, headphones too!
And my answer?
And you'll give the information?
- As soon as I get my memory, sir!
<I> -They've asked for Kali's ransom.
- A Ransom...? </ i>
You know, the money they ask for
after kidnapping..., right?
But Rahul's just hidden Kali...
and run away somewhere...!
Why would he do that? And
where would he hide her or escape to?
That's what Shoumik said.
Kali's been kidnapped.
And the ransom is 2 million.
- Who told you that?
- 2 million...?
I'll call you later.
Gauri? Trace the location of
Mrs. Bose's phone.
Jadhav, this girl...
this dancer, Rakhi Malhotra...
... dancer and singer...
Rakhi Malhotra?
- Do you know any of her songs?
- Yes, sir.
'Touch me, brush me'  'Squeeze me, please me'
Basically she's asking him
to feel her up.
'On the library floor,
at the Post Office back door...
'...In the garden... on the table...
In the classroom...'
# In bed, on the table
and in the classroom #
'Squeeze me, Please me'
# I will make you shiver #
She repeats it all the time.
The boy does not want to hold her,
and finally...
... is a story of heartbreak.
Match Rakhi's voice sample with the song.
Yes, sir.
- Vinayak, where are you?
- At home.
- And my wife?
- She's also home, sir.
Perfect.
Sir,
In fact, a playback singer sings the song,
Rakhi only dances to it!
How do we match the voices?
It's always better to pay and she will survive.
My husband was threatened by the
underworld, when he was producing my film.
... he paid up quietly...
and that's why
we sleep easy today, peacefully.
Luckily, the kidnapper does not
know your husband is a police officer.
Otherwise,
Kali would be dead by now!
But I don't know who to give the ransom...
Where shall I find that money?
<I> Sis, I need money for a phone
</ i>
<I> Dad refuses to help me </ i>
<I> I'm in serious debt, Papa won't help. </ i>.
 My phone is damaged,
can not communicate anyone. </ i>
People think I'm avoiding them.
I have to buy a phone.
- You are my sister, help me.
- I don't have any money, Siddhant..
Where's the mobile phone I'd gave you?
where it is?
I no longer have it.
- Where is it?
- I dont have it. Stop it, Siddhant!
Siddhant, enough!
- What's going on?
- Forget It.
... he's my brother.. Go Away.
<I> 'Keep the money ready by tomorrow.'
</ i>
<I> 'Not a rupee less...' </ i>
Hello?
Dude, have you read of a single kidnapping
where the kid's been found alive?
The child is always sacrificed.They're chopped and thrown.
I tried to tell Bose this but
he's too busy
reminding me that he topped in Chemistry!
<I> Listen... < / i>
can't we borrow
2 million??
Who will give two million?
How? You can't repay shit...
and I'm already battling debt!
There has to be someone we can ask!
What about robbery?
What?
There's this gang that robs jewelry shops.
in Ghatkopar.
<I> So what </ i>?
<I> We can do the same,too. </ i>
See, it's easier to rob a jewelry
shop than a bank!
<I>Are you crazy ?</ i>.
Fuck you! You're broke and won't
talk to Bose.
You don't have a choice!
Listen...!
What if we pay our ransom
by kidnapping someone else?
But who?
Rakhi's husband,
the fat producer..
No, man.... What are you saying?
Do you think perhaps Rakhi love him?
Let's meet somewhere first.
- We'll decide later!
<I> - Well </ i>
Maybe people are right...
you can't act.
Maybe.
Maybe it's true..
Maybe I'll never become a star.
But this is my dream and
that's what I'll do till the end..
Even if I
get a break at 60..
- Do you understand?
- What about me?
Fuck you...!
What do you want!?
How long will I take money from
Papa to run the house?
That's pocket money for
your lifestyle, it's not for me.
Not for me.
I've never asked.
- Because you don't give me shit!
- Because I don't make shit...!
You're free to leave
whenever you like.
- I do not want a silly job from 9 to 5.
- And Kali?
I'll look after her.
You go...!
Please, just talk to Papa...
I have nothing to say to your father.
You chose to elope with me, right?
Leave if you're unhappy...
I'm not stopping you!
But I'm staying right here... even
if it means being a junior artist!
You're so stubborn and so stupid!!
Yes, I'm stupid.
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm stupid.
- Stop saying 'sorry' every time.
- Sorry...!
- Don't cry now!
- Yes, I want to!
Well, cry!
Shalini. You ever considered acting??
- Me?
- You're beautiful, you could be a star.
Not kidding, I swear.
- Come here.
- Go to mommy!
Come on.
Sit here and play with your toys.
And don't disturb mom, she's busy!
- When will Rahul be back?
- He'll be late!
Usually when we meet,
only Rahul and you talk...
- That's true.
We've never spoken like this.
I only know you through Rahul.
- So am I really beautiful?
- Yes.
- Can I say something?
- Sure...!
- Won't laugh?
- No...!
- I was very fond of modeling once...!
- Why didn't you say earlier?
- I'll show you something?
- Show me.
Wait.
- What is it?
- I'll just show you.
What do you think?
It's great.
Really?
I bought it six years ago.
thinking I'll
wear it for one of Rahul's premieres..
I've never seen you in it..
- Shall I wear it now? -Sure...
Give me five.
Wait outside please.
Put that there.
Five minutes.
Do you want your milk?
Kali, you have to have some
before you sleep, okay?
Leave the toy.
Come on in...!
Wow! You look stunning...
Wonderful.
- Really?
- Yes
If a director saw you,
he'd cast you immediately....!
- You went to my house?
- Yes.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
You don't have fuel money...
couldn't you take a bus?
Fuck your ego and just ask
Bose for the money, man...!
- Where are they?
- The jewelry market!
What are they doing there?
It's Full of bloody guard...!
- I don't see them.
- And the guards have guns, man!
We should pick a corner shop...
after this festival season!
There must be some business with
lots of profit and no guards...!
All make profits, man,
but not in cash!
Most people pay by card.
Only jewelry shops or banks keep cash.
Look, think again...
it might be easier to tell Bose!
Take this iPhone....
It's brand new...
not the second hand crap you gave me!
Yeah, I've just reached.
Just park here.
- In the middle of the road?
No one comes here!
Come on..
Do not say anything, I'll talk about the money!
.
Pasa.
Mr. Producer... welcome!
Please sit.
Rahul, come!
What is this?
No, it's nothing ,just a bruise...
- How goes...?
- Same old...!
Murugan, . get the guns please!
Where is the bathroom?
- Where is the bathroom, please?
- Over there.
Jadhav, guards the entrance.
And you go with him.
- Rawal, you block the exit!
- Yes, sir.
Where is your friend?
Khanwilkar!
The cops!
- What did they come here to take? - Came to buy weapons, Sir.
Rahul fled. Chaitanya was captured.
And we've got the guns!
Rawal, take the car too...!!
No, leave the car here!
But keep an eye on it!
What do you want, sir?
- A rum.
- - We don't serve alcohol here.
Why the fuck are you
asking then...?
- Problem? - He wants alcohol... he's getting rude...
- I'll handle it.
You want to call the Commissioner,Is not it?
I have his number if you want.
Shall I dial the number for you?!
I'll fucking bury you
right here..
You wanted rum, right...
would you like it with some cola?
Our mutton dish is very famous.
Try some!.
Make yourself comfortable , sir.
- hey, get him some mince, sir.- Yes, sir..
One bottle of rum... quick! Be fast.
WEDNESDAY
Got a match?.
Get inside...!
Everyone stay down... sit down...!
- How much?
- Half a million... I swear!.
- Must pay 300,000.
- How were you going to pay back
a quarter million...?
Sir, I cast for movies.
I supply models...
- So you're a pimp, right...?
- No.
- You make that
much money through casting...?
How much do you earn through
casting...?
Answer the question!
- Sir, does it mean I'll pick up a little girl...?
- Do you prefer robbing a bank, right?
-Or ask for ransom for a little girl?
- I swear...I didn't kidnap the girl, sir..
- We found a SIM card in your office.
We found a foreign SIM card in
your office... where did it come from?
I do not know. Why hit me, sir?
Why is he lying, sir?
- You went abroad, right...?
Am I lying, fucker?
- You go abroad, right?
Sir, I don't even have a passport,
how will I go abroad?
- Stop hitting him, man!
- Sir, I've beaten the crap out of him before
.. but the fucker doesn't speak!
and it was useless.
Jadhav!!! Leave us.
Get out, Jadhav!
Motherfucker.
Want to eat something?
- Are you hungry? -Yes... yes...!
- Jadhav, get some food for him. - Want some cyanide curry,
motherfucker?
The call was received from a foreign number...
... but it was made from Mumbai.
To do this one needs international
roaming... and we suspect Chaitanya!
He won't confess to us...
Can you talk to him?
We do not tolerate each other, but
it has nothing to do with Kali.
We've found 8 kids in trying
to find her, but not Kali.
You get it,, asshole!
Are you going to help us
or try to rob a fucking bank...?
Only I can save Kali.
If you try to be a hero
you'll only find her corpse!
Sit.
Do you want some?
- Want to eat? - Eat, man...!
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.
When I came over...
the day Kali disappeared.....
... how did you know she was in the car?
Are you also suspecting me?
- How could you know?
- What the fuck is this?
Didn't you say it at the police station
that we had talked on the fucking phone...?
That was to protect you.
But I remember damn well that
I never told you she was in the car!
Then you remember swearing at Shalini
when you picked up Kali?
And that you wanted to
show Kali a film?asshole?
Any idiot would have understood that she was with you!
You're Right.
But why did you think
she's in the car and not upstairs?
But if she's not upstairs with you,
she has to be downstairs, right...?
Could've been in the toilet...! Logically,
you should've asked where she is!
But you didn't. You said the car door
was open and Kali wasn't there.
- Is not it true? .
- Yes
That's because I know you
for 15 years, asshole.
And you've been a
reckless fuck before too.
I know you leave her in the car
because she hates being around your work.
What would I gain by kidnapping Kali?
What hast thou to me, asshole?
Now I have been paying your rent for two years.
I'm pays your gasoline,
even your booze, you bastard!
I'm paying your phone balance.
And did I ever asked you to pay me back?
And you're suspecting me...?
Call yourself a friend...? Dumbass.
Why don't you just torture a
confession out of me like these cops...!
Why was there a ransom call made from
a tower in your area?
- What?
- A cell phone tower....
I get it, asshole.
One calls from a phone, not a tower!
And a tower covers several phones in
an area.
I did not make that call...!
How do I make you believe me,
fucker...!
You're too stupid.
- If it was not Chaitanya...
- Take your call...!
Chaitanya?
<I> Hello </ i>
<I> 'Dad, You're coming to get me, right?' </ i>
Kali, honey?
Hello?
Kali?
<I> Kali? Hello </ i>
<I> 'Keep the money ready by tomorrow.
I'll call at noon...!' </ i>
- Who is it? -We go covert!
Continue the investigation.
Motherfucker!
What were you doing, baby?
Did you talk to someone?
I can see how strong you love me.
Your tea.
MISSING
Commissioner Bose?
It's your favourite gangster, Pujari!
Do you know of the magical world of
online calling services?
There are several such online services.
Indians usually prefer ones from the UK.
It's difficult to trace which online...
....service the kidnapper may have used., sir.
Even if we do, we can't predict a
digit random number that he picked...
... there are hundreds of possible
numbers and are randomized.
And if we don't know the number,..
-...we can't track his IP address, sir..
- Check all cyber cafes.
Chaitanya, Rahul... others in our radar......
even their friends are our suspects now!
Seize their computers,
laptops, smart phones......
..find out who used an
online calling service!
- All cyber cafes, sir?
- Yes, everyone.
Upadhyay,
one pay for this service with a.....
- Credit Card, sir.
- Right. Seize their credit cards, too.
And find out who made the ransom call.
<I> Do you miss your daughter </ i>
Who is this?
<I> Quiet...!
First make sure you're alone! </ i>
- Are you alone?
- <I> Yes. Where is Kali </ i>
Kali is asleeps.
Your wife is waiting.
But I have no one.
God bless... Stay happy!
- What do you want?
- Five million.
- I do not have that amount.
<I> - Ask your dad! </ i>
I know he's very rich.
..l'll call back at 5!.
What happened...?
Who was that?
He told me...
... not to call Shaumik.
What happened?
Nothing. Just make us some tea please..
I talk to her.
What does he want?
Money.
How will I arrange so much money...?
I don't even have money to pay the hairdresser.
How much do you need?
6.5 million.
6.5 million.
- He warned not to tell Shoumik!
- Where are you?
- Just reaching, sir...!
Hurry up or i will break the door.
I'm already here.
Took so long!
- There was traffic, sir.
- I don't like to wait.
- Turn on the light. .
- Yes, sir.
"Father-looking couple."
your film, huh?
You're quite a stud!!
- Is that the CPU?
- Yes, sir.
- What are you doing?
- Turn around.
-  No, sir... I'm not into that...!.
- Shut up and give me your wallet...!
- It's in the front pocket.
- Slippery fucker!
- Is it a debit or credit card?
- Debit.
- Why sir?
- Just wanna check your account..
- You don't need the CPU for that?
- You'll get your card back.
But, sir...how will I work?
- What work do you do anyway?
- I can't audition without my
scripts, sir!. I need it.
Manage without it for 48 hours.
- If this box is clean, it's yours...or your ass is mine.
- But, Sir...
You'd mentioned a cyber cafe...
where is it?
- Hello...!
- Rakhi, where are you?
- I'm out, why?
I need to keep some money with you...
I can't keep it here!
- What money?
- When can you meet me?
Now.......?
I'll be at your place
around five, okay?, right?
<I> Do you have the money? </ i>
<I> I hear your door bell.
Maybe it's the money! </ i>
 - Is it here? </ i>
- Yes
Thanks..
- Don't I get hard for you.
- But for how long? Two? Three years?
A few more years and then
you'll be like my old man...!
"Not today, baby...
I am very tired."
Was that Rakhi?,
So you're squeezing/pleasing her these days??
Where is your computer?
Where did you put it?
Where is your computer?
- I have no computer.
- A laptop?
- No.
- You Sure?
- OK, show me your wallet.
- Why?
I just want to see your credit card!
- I have only debit card.
- Give it to me, I said.
Boss orders!
I'll scan it and return it.
Will Bose swipe it in his ass
and make a withdrawal of money?
- Don't slow down..keep going!
- I'm doing that...!
<I> - Do not lie. My people are watching you.
- I'm on my way...! </ i>
Hello..

trusted me more than your kids!
Now where is she...? Tell the truth.

Yes?
Sir, the car's going towards the
Western Express Highway.

- Rakhi Malhotra.
Rakhi Malhotra lives here?
Call her. We need talk to her.
Hello.
He just goes to bed.
You sleep for a couple of hours...
I"ll keep watch.
Why did you ask
additional 1.5 million from your father?
Where did you hide
the other 1.5 million?
What were you going to do with
that money?
Shalini,
Answer me...?.
Shalini...? I asked you something!
What question?
What do you want to know?
Have you ever asked me how I am?
If I need anything?
I was going to use this money to buy...
... things that you never gave me...!
.
Why did you marry me?
To get back what happened in college?
To show me that I was wrong
for choosing Rahul?
And that you're great...?
Is not that true?
You married me and .........
made me your prisoner...!
Have you ever touched me lovingly?
You even sleep with your door shut!
Ever noticed how I stare at you like a
starved dog when you're eating?
Have you ever asked me if I've eaten?
Why did you marry me if you
hate me so much?
Okay.
Your friend...
Yes?
Eh... that call that madam got on
her phone... sir

If you need anything...

You don't have to do anything.

We're hearing your calls carefully
and will be right behind you!
Your car is still outside the bar.
Dude, here's your debit card!.
Is it yours?
And this is your friend's.
We returned their debit cards, sir......

so we returned it.
What about computers?
We'll get reports of Chaitanya's
computer from the lab shortly.. Rahul does not have.
Keep me posted.

TWO DAYS
 - Hello. - Yes </ i>
TWO DAYS AFTER
- Hello...! Detection 2, Mumbai.
- Yes?
Special Branch, Lucknow.
I'm
inquiring about an old kidnapping case...!
Do you have the case number?
The police know everything.
You're being investigated.
Turns out you did jail time for years!
See, this is a child abduction case.
And our boss.....
...  suspects your nephew Shrilal!
This woman and her nephew Shrilal made masks
for children and sold them in trains.
That's how they picked up kids
and then sold them.
According to Lucknow police,
Shrilal is actually not her nephew..
I informed my superiors...
...that you've cleaned up your act now!
living honestly.
But if they find out
you're withholding...
... information... then they'll
have to arrest you!
- Is he your nephew?
- Yes, but...
-Raised him like a mother...? - All I know is that no one has seen him for 7 days!
The woman is under surveillance...
... but so far
we've got no clues on Kali!
Only she can lead us to Kali.
The public will burn you alive..
with him.
I can not do anything.
You will be burnt alive... trust me!
Sir,
I'm following dead Shrilal's aunt.
She's brought me near Chaitanya's house,
where Kali disappeared from...!
Sir, it was Shrilal, our primary
suspect, who kidnapped her...
...if not died on road...
Sir,
We could have saved her.
Is there any light left
where you live, Papa?
I will fall like a dark teardrop
from your black sky.
From a broken tin can
is candy still stolen...
...by a naughty little girl,
who loves teasing you?
Does the ground still curl around
your finger and walk with you, Papa?
Quick, check the courtyard
is Mother Tree on fire?

Translation by Buri
Do these fires ever rest?
Do ants have nests?
This abyss we've fallen in...
does it not have a boat?
Please eat Papa... does someone
still cajole you like this?
Do you still get matchboxes
filled with sunshine?
There lived two rabbits in that
chimney smoke, Papa...
Will anyone hear their
silent screams now?
Today you count in millions,
with hands ashen and reptilian.
Papa, is my moon still round?
Are your parties still sound?
Are your drinks still sweet...?
Your friends still on their feet?
Or have your hearts paused just a bit,
for a brief second... to mourn me...?
