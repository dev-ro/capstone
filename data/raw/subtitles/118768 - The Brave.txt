White guy, man, you know what?
I'm here about the job?
And what job is that?
- Maybe I am on the wrong place?
- Well you might be.
It depends...
On what?
On what or not you are in the right place
que buscas o no.
Are... are you the guy I am supposed to see?
I have to go?
Oh, I don't know.
Who told you that?
Some guy I met in the bar.
Who? Where? When?
The other day.
You will have to do better than that.
He gave me this here... the slip
He said that you were looking for somebody with a...
special kind of talent
Do you mind if i smoke?
It's your life
Thanks
What guy , Which bar?
Freedos. It's on Sixth Street.
You go there a lot, do you?
Sometimes...
You been drunken?
No, why?
Well, sometimes you and these men don't need to take a crack into.
Wizzy.
Will you... working anywhere now?
You think I would be here if I worked?!!
Why aren't you working?
There's ain't no jobs.
Maybe you drink too much.
Maybe you don't drink enough.
Have you done any time?...
That's a stupid question!!
What for?...
Drunk and disorderly.
Burglary.
Grand theft auto. I was a minor.
Assault.
That's enough.
Three times. A loser...
Habitual...
Married?
Yeah.
Kids?
Have you got any kids?
That's why you want the job,
Isn't it?
For your family.
I got a boy and a girl.
What other family you got?
No brothers?
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Well, the family thing can be kinda touchy.
Sometimes they can be -
- a real pain in the ass, as you can imagine.
Specially Brothers..
Wizzy.
I have one but He is dead.
How did he die?
Vietnam.
He blew his brains out
ten days after he got back.
Oh, really?
That kind of thing run in your family?
Death?
Suicide.
Hey, I will tell you what...
Come with me.
Oh, I am sorry.
I thank you very much for coming.
I am very pleased that you ...
My God!!
What's the matter?
Excuse me.
Please...
Well, May I ask your name?
Raphael.
Raphael...
It's very beautiful name.
It's unfortunate we...
we are meeting in this somber,
dreary circumstances.
All we have here is...
a little bit of shadow-play.
May I offer you some refreshment?
Let's have a drink.
Tell me
Are you afraid to die?
Are you?
No... Not now
No, I am not afraid to die.
I regard death as now, a sort of necessary
metamorphosis
Perhaps the more painful
the death, more...
Well, it is a kind of refinement.
See, there's pain
when we come into the world at birth
So it's fitting there should be,
pain at the end of it.
It's sort of a transfiguration, the completion of a...
the completion of a... equation
Have you ever seen any woman giving birth?
No. Well, her face is twisted.
It's full of sweat and anguish.
But strangely punctuated by...
joy...
You know, in someways Raphael, I...
I feel kinship,
I feel that we are the same mind...
Watching a painful death can be
a great inspiration
for those who... who are not dying.
So that they can see how brave
we can be when it's time to go
It is the final measure of bravery to stand up to death
It's exquisite anguish.
And
I am sorry.
When... when death finally, comes and...
pays us it's final, visit...
we... we then can bid him welcome.
It seems to me now...
... that the closer that...
... one can come to death in life...
... makes the passage into death...
... allover easy.
And it also leaves behind the greatest gift, that anyone can
give another, which is...
... the courage to face death.
And that's the greatest contribution that anyone can...
let's put... give another.
Anyway ...
How much will I be payed for that?
Well, actually I am trying to be realistic
I thought that depends on...
How willing you are...
How brave you are...
Well, does the more you are able to withstand
spiritually and physically... then
the more money will be paid to you.
You know, it's always...
I mean it's ...
... really insulting to put a price on life.
But if we have to render unto Caesar,
the things that are Caesars
... and render unto God the things that are Gods.
then...
I'd say 50,000 $
I'll pay you some of it right now.
What if I take off?
You know, I spent most of life
developing an instinct
An instinct about people.
And I think a man of your spirit,
your culture,
your honesty,
No, I do not think you would do that
Please take it now
And, respect your commitment.
Yeah.
When you want me back?
Let's say one week.
Yeah, one week.
Goodbye my young friend.
Okay.
hey Bob
Off the bar!
Fuck!
Hey, what about your drink?
Asshole!
What time?
Eh, come on, don't wait on the car.

That's enough kids.
GO inside and get ready for a bath.
Frankie, get a clean underwear for you and your sister.
No complaining. Go in.
When is it...
Why don't you get around?
Do you think you could watch them.
I need to go and get some water.
I'll get it.
You've got to go further upstream now.
All the water is too dirty.
Cohicse, How you doin'?
You actually going to drink that?
No wonder you people are on your last leg.
What do you want?
Well, I ain't exactly here on vacation.
Mr. McCarthy sends me out here to check on you.
Thought you might be here in cold feet.
My advice to you is, don't.
I'll be there.
It's my function to make sure you are.
de que as√≠ sea.
I said I'll be there.
Oh, that's good!
Because unless you plan on
putting that pretty little wife and kids of yours
on a plane to fuckin' Bora Bora
Not to mention, whole damn dad and...
Whoever else you may care for out here in this shithole...
I'm gonna find them.
Then I am gonna kill them.
And then I'm gonna fuck'em
And then I'm gonna eat'em
Come on Cochise,
One more little scar ain't gonna make any difference.
See you in the movies, Toronto
You okay?
Yes, we are okay.
She doesn't want to take a bath.
You get the water?
- No, I dropped it.
Does Dad is still sick?
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?!
- Eh?... Nothing
Nothing.
- How can it be nothing?
- Nothing
- Raphael, what's going on?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...
- What's the... what's the matter?
- I'll show you... Wake up, wake up... wake up, wake up. Come on... wake up 'em
-Come on, come on...
- Raphael, are you...? - No, no... Come on, come on...
Come on, come on, come on...
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Okay, okay...

He is helping us, he is taking us...
Wow... Who is this?
That's your brother.
Okay.

Stop, Stop, Keep your eyes closed. Don't look.
I want to go to sleep.
Don't talk. We'll
soon go to sleep.
Okay, Open your eyes.
Wow! It's beautiful.
frankie, Mika.
Go and play.
Yes!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Where did you get the money for all these?
Hh...?
What was it this time?
You and your Luis, hit a liquor store?
A 7-Eleven?
I hope this was a good one, Raphael.
I hope it's worth you going back inside...
... and never see me or the kids again.
I didn't rob anybody, baby.
You can think what you want
but it's not true.
I have been missing for a long time,
I know.
Everything will be different now
I promise.
We'll see.
I wanna provide,
for my family.
I have known you for a long time.
Before prison...
Before liquor...
The children didn't get...
Raphael.
They only got taste of you,
in prison time and drinking...
You want to provide for your family?!
You kinda loved 'em first.
Frankie was 7 the last time you went in
And was 10 when you came out.
Marta sleeps more than any child I have ever seen.
She is afraid to be awake.
That's not love, Raphael
is purgatory.
I hope this money is straight.
I hope you got it doing the right thing.
I know.
Frankie, watch this.
Frankie, let's just play.
It's giant. Come on, please.
What's wrong with you?
Have you seen your brother?
Why?
I just wanted to talk to him.
Why?
Because.
Because why?
Because, because...
Is he in trouble?
No.
If I tell you, I'll be in trouble?
No, honey.
- You promise?
- That's promise.
He's hiding.
Thanks honey.
The can you can see is the phone.
Can you hear me now?
Yeah.
May I come in?
No.
Just for a second.
Okay.
Come on,
I want you to go somewhere with me.
Where?
Just into town, to buy some things.
Can I stay here?
I kind of want you to go...
I kind of want to stay here.
Huh...
Come on!
Come on...
It's pretty nice today, isn't it?
Yeah, so...
You know, I used to go for walks like this.
With papa, when I was a kid.
But not here.
We didn't always live here.
Used to live up in hills.
It was better there.
You'd have liked it.
This isn't such a good place for you.
Not only for you,
and your mom, and your sister.
I know that.
It's okay.
There's a lot better places.
Maybe you don't know about them yet.
You know like,
Some of the places you see on TV.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to know that
I am trying to do something about it.
I don't want you to grow up here.
I want you and Marta, to have...
a real house, a real garden...
You know, I want you to have some nice things.
The new TV is pretty nice.
Yeah.
But there's other things, you know...
like an education, like school.
I don't like school.
Oh, you kind of got to like school, you know...
'Cause some day
You're gonna get outta here...
You're gonna be a chance to be somebody...
You hear me?
Because if anything happens to me...
You are the man of the house.
Think you can do that?
I think so.
What's the matter?
I heard moma saying, you might go back to jail again.
No.
I ain't going back to jail.
Promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Come on,
The bus has come, let's go...
You ready?
Oh, yeah...
May I help you with something?
Where does this go papa?
Hmm?...
I don't know. I think it's extra.
You mean, In case an even extra heart?!
Really that is?! Let's see...
Ah...
Oui... He doesn't have a ding dong...
Ding dong... Ding dong...
Maybe it's in here buddy. See...
Maybe it's a girl...
Then where is the boobies, stupid?
I think we should put this game away for now.
- Let's go inside, I am gonna make some...
- Mommy, Frankie called me stupid.
- Thanks father.
- Saturday confession, Huh? huh?...
How are you, Raphael?
I am fine father. You?
Good... Good, Thanks.
Oh!, you got a lot of new stuff.
Yeah, you know...
There's some stuff.
Pretty expensive stuff.
I guess...
You know me.
I like to reserve judgment.
That's what the good lord says.
And after all he is my way.
But something smells funny.
Check your shoes.
Maybe stepped under something.
Let's not mock about.
Your Rita is a little concerned about your newfound wealth.
Quite frankly, so am I.
I don't have to tell you, what this looks like to her,
and to everybody.
I guess you didn't hear,
I got a job.
Oh, yeah?
Where?
I know most of the business people in town.
It's good to know, who is being so generous?
Look...
Rita asked you to come and give me the big speech, Okay.
Fine,. I appreciate the thought.
I appreciate the time.
I don't know what else it looks like.
Yeah, Of course I do.
But it isn't what you think,
I promise.
Okay
But she feels she should ask me to come out here and talk to you.
But I have to talk to everybody anyway.
This dump has been bought by a big salvage company.
They are now looking to move everybody of the land,
and they don't care what it costs.
I have spoken to them.
They are not playing.
Just so, that you know.
If you get to your ass counted off the jail,
Your wife and your kids will have a roof over their heads.
When do they move in?
They have already started.
So, if you done something wrong
It's time to make arrangements.
You know, in Sunday we are
going to have a big fiesta, father... and
I just know that we would love you to be there.
I'll be at the church,
if you need me.
You would be there even if,
I don't too want you.

And Waylon Jenning's, Tony Jo White?

Come on, what do you remember?
That it was like this...
It was around this time...
The air felt this way...
The wind felt like this...
What else?
My heart was pounding...
I was scared of you.
- Father Stratton?
- Raphael?
- Can I talk to you about something?
Sure.
But if I tell you something...
Does that mean, you can't tell anybody?
Well, if you're talking about
a confession, then yes.
That's between you and God.
Is that what you want?
You wanna make a confession?
Yeah, I think so.
Come.
Forgive me father,
for I have sinned.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Well, I...
I really haven't,
thought about religion much over the years.
Then why are you here?
For Rita, and my kids.
Go on...
Tomorrow morning, Father...
I am going to walk into a room...
and some men are going to kill me.
They are going to torture me ...
And then they are going to kill me.
And for this circus ...
I will be paid...
My... my family will be paid...
50,000 dollars.
It isn't enough really, but...
It might be just enough to get
everybody out of here, forever...
Do you wish to repent these thoughts?
No.
Then what is it, you want to do with Church?
Nothing.
I need you to make sure,
they and my family gets the money,
after I am gone.
You're the only person,
that can do that.
You're the only one.
Please.
I need your help.
Do you understand what
you are asking of me?
You are asking a priest
to help you to committ suicide.
You are asking a priest
to commit a cardinal sin.
In a couple of days, Father...
they are going to destroy the Morgan town...
The entire village.
What happens then?
Where do Rita and the kids go?
Does God gonna let them live here?
You and the Church gonna buy me a house?
Maybe the government...
May be they will do something
What do you think?
Please.
Please help me.
I can't.
Raphael...
You've sold your soul.
Oh, no... Father.
I sold my body, like a whore.
The church forgives whores everyday.
Don't do this...
Don't do this...
What's wrong?
Come on, what's wrong?
What's wrong?
Who did this?... Who did this?...
Luis?...
What happened?
He looked so crazy.
He was high on something.
I don't know...
I tried to stop him. But he hit me.
He hit me...
- Did he rape you?...
- No...
Frankie jumped on him,
and started hitting him.
Where's Frankie?
He's outside.
You stay here.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
I'm sorry, papa.
What do you mean, you're sorry?
You were gone and
I was the man of the house.
And, I couldn't make him go away.
Well, listen to me.
You did a brave thing.
Very brave thing.
I'm... I'm proud of you.
Come here.
I beat the hell out of him, Poppa.
Good.
Why don't you go,
see back you Mom... Huh?
And, what if he comes back?
He is not gonna come back.
He is too afraid of you.
All right?
Believe me.
Go on,
Pussy... pussy...
You're a man now.
I love you, Papa.
I love you too.
Go on...
Go see your mother.

I have always tried to live with the spirits...
vivir con los esp√≠ritus, ...
I have always tried to show you that, world...
It seemed like you didn't care...
But now,
I think you do care...
So, I think you should sit along
with the spirits.
I'm gonna put you out there...
Just like there are good and bad spirits,
there are good and bad tour leaders.
Just remember son,
Whatever you do,
think of the children first.
Sweet dreams, angel.
I love you, Okay.
