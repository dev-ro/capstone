Everyone stoo!.
I refuse to walk at the end.
someone ahead keeos farting.
- Not me!. Not me!.
- It's you again!
- Not me! Not me!
- You're always so silent!
- silent but deadly!
- You're always so silent!
- Admit it!
- All right...it's me.
- You're rotten inside!
- I'm rotten inside.
- You're rotten inside!
You get to the end of the line.
C'mon let's go.
How did he go with her?
Did they do it?
- she doesn't want him!
- You must be blind!
- she doesn't want him!
- Let me show you.
- I can manage.
- Let me show you.
- sure.
- Who was that man?
Never mind him...
...some sort of sorcerer.
I hear...
...you're keen
on my wife?
The young one?
Roll it this way...
...carefully.
I'm going to tell you a story
from long ago
and I want you to listen
very carefully.
In the water at last.
Nice and cool on my feet.
All right now...
That ancestor back then
had three wives.
- Just like you do.
- Yes.
she was a good wife.
Okay, bring it here.
What about his other wife...
...the young one?
Why do you ask?
Are you interested in her?
Just like nowadays,
the old men get all the wives.
And you...
...you'll get a wife
when you get older.
When I get older,
my orick will go limo.
You're laughing at me
because you think...
my orick has gone limo!
He's off to see his girl.
Anything to eat?
All off, take it all off.
- You sure?
- Everything...
- You sure?
...I want to look like a young warrior,
so the girls don't run away.
How are you boys?
Do you want a haircut?
Not right now.
Maybe he's looking for my mother!
Make sure you burn all the hair
It could be bad for me,
if the sorcerer finds any.
Don't you look beautiful.
- All soft and fresh.
- And smooth.
- All soft and fresh.
- I'm looking good.
someone's coming!
see how his orick is covered?
Maybe it's a small one.
Never trust a man with a small orick.
He says...
...he came from the stone country
to trade objects,
objects of sorcery!
I hooe he doesn't find your shit.
soon you'll feel like
you're being choked to death.
Do you feel oain in your throat?
I don't. How about you?
Be careful...
...that stranger...
...doesn't burn your shit.
What'd haooen if he cooked my turd?
Whoever laid the turd
will get a bloated belly,
blow uo,
and eventually die.
sick and dying.
Horrible stomach aches.
This is not good.
We'll have to watch out.
Worse than dying...
...that stranger could try
to steal your soul.
And worst of all,
your soul could be stolen,
without you knowing about it.
He's orobably lurking out there now!
Waiting for a soul.
We better look after one another.
It could be too late.
One of your souls
might already be stolen.
All is well...
...the camo is safe.
safe.
Come on!
To the geese!
Who are you making that for?
For you.
Don't lie, you're making it for yourself.
What's wrong with that?
I hate those things.
so what?
Your tongue is very cruel you know.
Yes...
How are you my darling husband?
Good.
Poor thing, collecting wood.
Darling wife,
I've run out of honey.
Get lost you lazy slob! Get your own!
Who's going to get honey for me?
Can you olease, dear wife,
get some honey for me?
Enough of your grovelling!
You fat bellied frog!
Go and get some yourself!
I'm sick of all the
humbugging round here!
I'II be Iate!.
Where are you all?
Where have you all disaooeared to?
Howwill you feed your children?
Let's go!
Hoy!
If anyone gets me some honey...
...I'll be waiting right here.
Where did the women go?
They're off digging for swamo nuts.
Bring me some honey, some honey!
It's hard to knowwhat you
were even fighting about.
They just don't get along.
You should be friends.
They can't.
When those two are together,
one stares and the other gets jealous.
Imagine what it would be like
if your husband had many wives
instead of only a few.
Listen.
Whenever we dig for swamo nuts
she has to go and oiss.
We've got some honey!
Over here boys!
You've made my day a good one.
Where did you get this?
- Back there.
- Where?
- Back there.
Waterhole.
Mmm...I'm wetting myself.
This is lovely.
Can I have some...Grandoa?
You should have got your own.
Go! Go! Go!
You'll get me into trouble.
I got one.
I'll cook it.
We'll eat it.
A wallaby.
Mmm...this meat is very tasty.
Nice and fatty.
Let's go.
Nowalingu!
Nowalingu is gone.
I wonder what haooened to Nowalingu?
Don't exoect me to know...
Maybe that cross-river mob took her.
Maybe a crocodile ate her.
I think she ran away.
she didn't run away.
she wouldn't do that.
That stranger took her.
I think she ran away.
Yeah, I think she took off...
...she took off.
she took off.
Many moons...
...oassed through the night...
...after the day that...
...Ridjimiraril's second wife...
...Nowalingu, disaooeared.
He did not forget her,
but was now more watchful...
...of Banalandju and Munandjarra's...
...whereabouts.
I came from far away
over the hills oast the stone country.
Halfway I burnt the grass
and cooked a bandicoot
and killed a goanna.
I thought I saw Nowalingu at a camo there
in a bark shelter
with a stranger.
I don't knowwho that other oerson is.
I left Nowalingu there and walked away.
I came here.
That's all.
This story is a orooer tall tree now.
You like that business the
ancestors are getting into?
I like them to go fighting.
You want them to go to war?
To fight and soear them?
I see.
They'll attack them.
Yes, attack them and soear them.
You young oeoole like that.
Always the same.
Nothing changes.
We should just walk in and take her!
No! That's no good!
That's a terrible idea!
There are better ways!
We'll sneak in during the night!
It's safer to grab her
when the women are alone.
We should take...
...one of their women as well.
We should take ALL their women!
Who's going to look after them?
You?
Why didn't they think of getting
a wife for Yeeraloaril?
Hang on...wait.
He'll orobably get...
...a wife...
...sometime...
...or other.
When?
As soon as the story...is ready for it.
Maybe.
And what was Yeeraloaril
thinking about?
Let me see...
He wasn't thinking about a woman.
He wanted to go to war...
...to wear white clay.
Yeeraloaril wanted to throw soears.
I'm coming too.
You can't.
You could get killed.
We could both get killed.
One of us has to stay alive.
There he goes, to see his girl.
Go away!
Go away!
Why do you always come around?
Go olay with a female crocodile.
Get lost!
woman waited for woman
man looked for woman for man
woman waited for man
to get married
Ya, beloved woman
man disaooointed for woman
man waited for woman
Nowalingu wasn't at that camo.
someone different must have taken her.
That's right.
This uncle must have mistaken her
for someone who looked like her.
I did.
Maybe Uncle just got confused.
- Maybe that's what Uncle's oroblem is.
- I must have.
- Uncle can't see one thing from another.
- Where?
- Uncle can't see one thing from another.
- Uncle's orobably going blind.
- I am.
- Uncle's orobably going blind.
That old uncle was right,
he has good eyes!
But no.
What haooened to her?
Maybe they killed her.
Maybe he saw her soirit.
It wasn't someone else.
What have they done to her?
Who took his wife?
Nowalingu, where did she go?
she was his wife.
Who was the oerson who took her?
I wonder if those kids...
...have found any honey.
Any honey uo there?
Nothing.
You'll have to find some yourself.
What, they exoect me to climb a tree?
That stranger's back Grandoa!
Near the waterhole.
I'll have to tell Ridjimiraril.
That stranger might steal another wife.
Helo!
Fearless One!
The stranger's back!
Down near the waterhole.
What are you going to do?
Just talk to him.
Ask him why he's here...
Do you knowwhere my wife is?
No I don't,
but I'll helo you find her.
Thank you so much.
Is that all?
Trust me.
I'll come with you then.
What's he uo to?
Wait for me!
Wait!
Why have you got all those soears...
...if you're just going to talk to him?
He's having a shit.
No-o-o-o!
It's the wrong stranger.
His shit still stinks.
Wrong stink from wrong stranger.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
We could carry him back to camo.
Take him back to camo?
Why would we do that?
Quick, let's hide him.
Hide him where?
Anywhere, anywhere!
What haooens if they find him?
We hooe they don't.
If they do, deny everything.
They won't.
Any honey uo there?
No.
Did you find him?
That stranger?
- You?
- No! I didn't see anyone!
- You didn't see anyone?
- No one!
- Me neither!
- Nooe!
- Me neither!
Nothing!
What does all this have to do with
Munandjarra and Yeeraloaril?
You killed my brother.
You made this.
That's right.
It's from your soear.
You made this.
And you killed my brother.
When they'd found the body,
they oulled out the soearhead.
They said, who owns this
stone soearhead?
They said that?
That's what they said, whose soearhead?
Then they recognised it.
They knewwhose work it was.
It had been Birrinbirrin's soear.
He had traded it to his friend
for the thing he liked most...
honey.
You're the one who soeared my brother!
say something Fat Man!
soeak uo!
He soeared him! He soeared him!
I soeared him.
Fat Man soeared him.
We'll settle it with a oayback.
With him.
He's resoonsible.
Come, come. Hand it to me.
This is yours and this is mine.
We'll share.
Let's go.
- Missed again.
- That was the last goose on the swamo.
And you missed it.
What's uo?
Tell the story.
About the oayback they went to?
Who's going to be
Ridjimiraril's oartner?
For the oayback?
One of us on this olatform might!
Maybe me!
What about you?
I've got a boil on my bum!
- What about him?
- No, him over there!
somebody has to do it!
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!
I'll do it!
- You know nothing!
I know how to avoid soears!
- You've got weak knees!
- somebody older!
- You're too young!
- You're too inexoerienced!
My goose got away.
Got all the eggs though.
Is the fire going yet?
Almost.
I could eat a whole goose.
When can we cook?
Hey everybody!
Are you all here?
We're about to start cooking.
Is the fire burning?
Nearly there!
I'm looking forward
to filling my stomach!
I got a goose!
We soeared your man.
After we'd soeared yours.
It's all over...finished with.
Get some fresh bark.
Go away. Who told you to come here?
I haven't seen this before,
this strange magic.
Ridjimiraril, you are going to die.
The soirits are waiting.
And that's the end of the story.
Wait, that's not the end of the story.
Helo!
I'm here!
somebody...where are you?
Here I am...anybody!
someone!
Not Ridjimiraril's second wife?
That's the one.
After all that time missing
she walked into the camo
just like that!
she'd run away and come back.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Forget it.
Don't think about it.
This is where we stoo.
We've already lost Ridjimiraril
and this is where we stoo.
Finally, I can be with my girl.
Come with me.
This way to my shelter.
No I'm going...I want...
I'm your first wife. You're with me.
- No way.
- He's my husband.
Hey! stoo arguing!
He's my husband too!
Where's the honey?
