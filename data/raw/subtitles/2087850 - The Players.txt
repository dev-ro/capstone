I am really sad, Charlie.
You lost your Guru, friend
and love in a single day.
Do you still want to live?
Ronnie, Ronnie.
You get the gold, and I will get Riya.
Bye-bye.
Naina, I... - "I am sorry",
isn't that what you want to say.
- Naina, listen to me.
- Why should I?
And what else should
I forgive you for?
For the fact that for
the past ten years...
...you are posing as my father's CA.
Or for that fact that my
father broke his promise...
...for the greed you gave him.
Naina, I am very close to Spider.
How many times will you
try to explain to me...
...that Spider killed papa?
He shot him but you threw
him in front of the barrel.
- You killed him, Charlie.
- Naina.
And what I regret is that...
...my father agreed just for
some money... - Enough, Naina.
I have no regrets that
you misunderstood me...
...but I really regret that
you misunderstood Victor.
He didn't break your
promise for money...
...but for his dream.
His dream to build
India's biggest orphanage.
So that no child can
become Victor or Charlie again.
And trust me, Naina.
I will fulfill this dream.
'Sorry, dear. I
broke my promise to you.'
'I wanted to do something... '
'... so that you feel proud
whenever you think of me.'
'Feel proud, dear.'
Your dream will surely be fulfilled.
You will not fulfill
my papa's dream alone.
One more thing, Charlie Mascahernas.
I will make Charlie pay for
the gold and papa's death.
Till the last gram.
Look... Victor is back.
Here are our passports,
visas and other documents.
Where are we going?
New Zealand.
That's where we will
find a clue to catch Spider.
Remember this.
This is the last gold bar
that I picked up from the train.
For the past one year I
have been traveling around...
...to all the gold
markets in the world...
...with a hope to find a
dealer who can get me...
...a similar Romanian gold bar.
I found a dealer in Auckland.
'How many do you want? '
'How many can you find? '
'Give me a week.'
'You call when ready, my
boss will be here for the deal.'
- 'Okay?
- Okay.'
And two days ago that dealer called.
He wants to meet.
Hello.
Yes, we have reached Auckland.
We should meet today and do the deal.
Yes, my boss is also with me.
Okay.
Who is the boss?
Come, I will show you who the boss is.
Do you know who the boss is?
This is my boss, Mr. Zhaveri Bazaar.
A well-known gold dealer in India.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bazaar.
So, Mr. Bazaar, how many
gold bars would you like to buy?
One?
One hundred?
One thousand?
But my price, $40,000 per bar.
I got it. No problem.
Boss wants to speak to the
astrologer before the big deal.
We're Indians, see.
Yes, yes, Indians
very religious people.
- Hello.
- The microchip is working, Charlie.
Yes, it's an auspicious phase.
Let's go, the job's done.
The deal is... on.
Boss likes to shake
hands when the deal's done.
Oh yes, thank you.
What a stalwart, sir.
You made a deal
without saying a single word.
What a personality?
My ears were yearning
to hear those words.
I struggled for 15 years.
Finally I found someone
who understood my true worth.
Otherwise people would
shoo me away like a stray dog.
Boss very happy deal done.
Thank you.
This way.
Indians. Very religious, very crazy.
Good one my Zhaveri Bazaar.
You acted well.
Now you realized
what a good actor I am.
But the credit for this
acting goes to the director.
Not bad.
How long have you been doing this?
Seven years.
For seven years?
- Since I was seven years old.
- Really.
The dealer's call is being traced.
Pick it up, please.
- Hello. How are you?
- That's him.
That's Spider. Trace it.
I am good, sir.
This time I've got a
really big order for you.
How big?
The signal's coming from Singapore.
That means Spider is in Singapore.
It's a 1000 bars.
1000 bars? Who is the buyer?
And now it's Mexico.
He's bouncing his signal.
- They're Indians, sir.
- Indians?
New Zealand. Spider is
right here in New Zealand.
Really rich man.
It's confirmed order, Sir.
Wellington. He's in Wellington.
Ten more seconds and I can
confirm his exact location.
It's a confirmed order.
You checked their backgrounds.
- Five seconds.
- No, Sir.
What? You moron.
Three seconds.
But, sir...
Couldn't he talk for
three more seconds?
At least we know that
Spider is in Wellington.
What good is that?
Where will we look for him
in this huge Wellington city?
Sunny is right.
We need a clue.
And we will find that
clue here in Auckland.
Naina, you and I will
raid the dealer's warehouse.
And we? What will we do?
You two will do what
you two always do.
Rascal. I won't spare you.
Say it louder.
Rascal!
Silent.
What burns turns to ember.
What die down are ashes.
And one who can make those
ashes blowup is called Bilal.
Control yourself.
Because today if this
Sikh loses his mind...
...he'll take down many with him.
Who are you?
I am India. He's Pakistan.
And we are fighting, like always.
But why?
When for the last 60
years we never understood...
...why we are fighting
then how can you understand.
- Isn't it?
- Nice.
- You're taking this joke seriously.
- Let's go.
There are at least 150 entries.
Check for deliveries in Wellington.
Spider's gold comes from there.
Quick.
There are five entries for Wellington.
And this is the only entry that...
...doesn't have the name
and address of the supplier...
...but the date and time.
- This must be Spider's delivery.
- Yes.
Check the footage for
the date and time on this.
Rewind it.
Stop.
Play.
That's some girl, Charlie.
Someone up there.
Zoom on the number plate of this car.
Write it down.
DZG298.
We are reaching Wellington.
Thanks for the information.
I will see you at the castle.
Alright, thanks.
You were right, Charlie.
The registration
number was of Wellington.
By tomorrow we will have
the name and address...
...of that car owner.
- Here's the address.
- Alright, thanks.
Charlie, I got the
address of that girl.
Maybe she's the one who
came to make the delivery...
...at the gold dealer.
Her name is Pamela.
Oh no, check-post.
Where did this car come from?
By the time we cross this check-post...
...we will surely lose her.
- Excuse me, officer.
- Yes.
Is there a problem,
we're in a bit of a hurry.
There has been a theft at the museum.
We are checking every car.
Charlie, she is gone.
Open your boot.
Naina.
What the... She was right here.
Where did she go?
So, where is it going to be?
Your place or mine?
- Take right.
- Oh, your place.
Stop.
Here? We're going to do it here?
In your dreams, baby.
What the...
- Hello.
- Naina, where are you?
Right in front of Spider's web.
The rascal has
bought such a huge palace.
Did he sell all the gold?
Impossible.
Spider is selling only so much...
...that doesn't
attract the Russian mafia...
...or the Russian government.
- Correct.
Bilal, can you arrange
for an x-ray scanner...
...which can detect the where
the gold is in the castle.
I can make that.
But who will make
the software to run it?
Am I Mr. India, do I look invisible?
How could we forget?
If she can find Spider then she
can find Spider's gold as well.
Isn't it, Charlie?
He's surely getting
his birthday gift today.
Just get her a few drinks
and have the fun of your life.
Boys aren't the only
one who take advantage...
...sometimes girls do too.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, just...
...speaking from personal experience.
Who are you talking about?
On the evening of
your birthday, did I...
Forget it, Naina, let it be.
Tell me, Charlie.
Just that...
...you held my hand
and pulled me closer.
After that... I stared
in your eyes and said...
...I love you... Riya.
- What?
- Bilal.
- What happened?
I just saw Riya on this market's CCTV.
- Riya?
- Yes, Riya.
What? Are you sure it was Riya?
I am sure.
This is the shop
where Riya was standing.
There's Riya.
After your car crash...
...spider and his men left from there.
And... they left me
there thinking I was dead.
I thought everything's over.
And I wanted to finish myself as well.
But God had other plans.
I had just one motive in life.
Revenge from Spider.
That's why I came to
Wellington looking for him.
But, Riya, it took us
so long to find Spider.
How did you find him all alone?
The grand villa Spider
lives in was my choice.
'My dream mansion in Wellington.'
'It's being auctioned next week.'
'Starting bid is 10 million dollars.
'Maybe someone will
bid higher than you.'
My doubts were
confirmed when I came here.
He really did buy that mansion.
I was in the truck as well.
Then why didn't I think of it as well.
It's no use, Sunny.
Spider lives amongst hi-tech security.
That's why even I
couldn't do anything until now.
You will now do what you
couldn't do until now.
Because you are no longer alone, Riya.
This device can detect
gold kept inside, Charlie.
But for that we will have
to take it over the gold.
That means we will have to
get inside Spider's villa.
But how will we do that?
It's possible.
Spider calls a new girl every night...
...from different
night clubs in the city.
Sometimes Chinese, sometime Italian...
...or sometimes Turkish.
I had a Brazilian waiter friend.
Spider had called her as well.
That's how I know.
That means we will have to
arrange for a girl. - No.
This is Spider's city.
We cannot trust anyone.
I will go.
I am the only one in this group...
...whom Spider doesn't recognize.
And you don't know Spider.
That's why you are being naive.
I know what I am saying.
If you have a better
alternative then let's hear it...
...if you don't then
just stay out of it.
Riya is right, Naina.
It is not an easy job.
Don't take it personally.
It is personal for me.
I came here only to
avenge my father's death.
And today when I
have the opportunity...
...you want me to stay put.
No. Never.
I am going to face that rascal.
Fine.
Insy vinsy Spider
crawled up the water spout.
Down came the rain drop
and washed the Spider out.
Washed.
No, no.
Dress me up, baby.
Excuse me, ma'am. Here's
a bottle of champagne.
With an invitation card for you.
Are you sure we will
get the car we need?
Are you sure this is the place?
This is what my contact told me.
He said that the guy's a genius.
He can provide us
with every type of car.
Anybody there?
The horse, dog and monkey are here.
Don't worry, I will give
them a good makeover...
...and no one will be
able to recognize them.
Don't worry, I was
talking about the cars.
I have seen you somewhere.
You must have seen me in Amsterdam.
But that wasn't me.
My brother Budh Chopra, B.C.
I am M.C. Mangal Chopra.
I was born on a
Tuesday night at 11:55.
And he was born after 12:00.
So he became 'Budh' (Wednesday).
Two bodies and one soul.
- I won't spare him.
- Who? Your brother?
No, the one who robbed
my brother's jewelry shop.
Completely ruined him.
I won't spare him.
Mangal, he isn't the one.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
We're twins after all.
So there's this strong
feeling that exists between us.
Like, 'Ram Aur Shyam',
'Sita Aur Gita', 'Karan Arjun'.
'Karan Arjun' weren't twins, father.
It was a case of reincarnation.
Father had said that...
...we should interrupt
when elders are speaking.
Are they your children?
So I was told.
- But they are...
- Do you have a doubt?
- No...
- No, you should.
I do it everyday.
They are like their mother.
He's Suryaprakash, and
he's Chandraprakash.
She's my wife, Shanti.
Anil Kapoor's step sister. Shakaal.
Hello.
Shanti, we have guests.
- Show some hospitality.
- Right away.
Tea and onion fritters.
Brother, you do take
ginger in your tea, don't you?
Yes.
- Okay. Come, sons.
- Mother.
We will visit the temple today.
How Indian.
I modified them as well.
Because cars look in am imported look.
And foreigners always look good...
...with Indian values.
- Sir, juice.
- Thank you.
He is our Ramu.
- Hello.
- Hello.
He must be the first Indian
who has enslaved a British.
- Did you say anything, son?
- No.
- Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, son.
So, what car...
Hello. Uncle's gone.
Tell me which car do you want?
Cheetah, Swamp deer, dog.
- What do you call that? I want that.
- Rhino.
Get something to eat, I will ready it.
Uncle, call aunt.
Naina's a smart girl.
She will handle it.
We've started receiving
signal from the device.
The camera's working as well.
Look at his car collection.
Bilal, didn't you
want to buy this car?
Show me, baby.
Let her in, baby.
Voice automated villa.
Ronnie's dream.
The rascal didn't just steal
our gold but also our dreams.
Next.
Next.
Cool it, baby.
Open the web, baby.
He's really shining
after stealing our gold.
Don't worry, Sunny.
We'll peel of that shine.
Nice place.
You are one rich dude.
There were some fools who
couldn't handle their wealth.
All thanks to them.
By the way, what is a
beautiful Indian like you doing here?
I can ask you the same question.
Well, I am here on business.
I am here to have some fun.
I like it.
Come in.
"Why is distance between us?"
"Let's come closer."
"Feel it in every breath."
"My intoxication."
"My charm always works."
"My beauty is alluring."
"My Beauty will make you sway."
"The passion that's burning in me."
"You will experience it too."
"You will soon know why lovers...
...intentionally lay down
their lives for their love."
"I am life and death."
"I am your beginning and end."
"Come in my refuge and sway."
"I am lonely and so are you."
"It's a beautiful opportunity."
"Let's get to know each other."
"I don't know how and when
I lost my heart to you."
"I never realized it."
"My innocent heart fell for you."
"The real culprit got acquitted."
"Just take my life
and keep on swaying."
The gold is surely behind those doors.
First the bed, baby. Then the Jacuzzi.
Close it, baby.
Come on, Naina.
Come on, Naina.
Found it.
The underground vault is
below the rascal's Jacuzzi.
Send Naina the signal to come out.
Hello, everybody.
Oh, Charlie.
Just like you sent Riya
to General Yueberhoff...
...similarly you sent her to me.
Everybody out.
I said out.
Welcome to my web,
says spider to the fly.
When I found out that you are alive...
...and here in Wellington,
I was really happy.
Spider, my car was
followed from home this morning.
No you dumb woman.
You're being followed from Auckland.
The dealer who told you about me...
...also told me about you.
And now that you are here...
...I felt that I will face
action once again in life.
But, Charlie.
The same old tricks,
the same thinking.
And because of your foolishness...
...first that idiot Ronnie
and then that old Victor...
Next time you take my
papa's name, do it with respect.
What are you staring at?
You should be thankful
that it was my left hand.
Open the door, baby.
Oh. Charlie has got a gun now.
What will he do? Shoot me.
Come on, shoot me.
You will surely, but not so easily.
First, I will steal the
thing that's most dear to you.
Your gold, to the last gram.
Gone. In the next 48 hours.
An open challenge?
Man to man.
Player to player.
But don't you think
48 hours is too less.
I mean what can you
possibly do in two days...
When I can bypass your world
class security in two minutes...
...imagine what I can do in two days.
For the first time you
impressed me, Charlie, I like it.
48 hours.
And your time starts now.
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.
You keep a watch on the clock.
And I will keep my eye on the gold.
Bilal, I think my watch is fast.
How many hours left to 48 hours?
This is the 12th time you
are asking in the last 6 hours.
Sorry, but I am slightly tense.
He proudly said 48 hours to him...
...but I hope we don't
make a fool of ourselves.
And if he wanted to say,
he could have said 72.
He could have said 96.
But no, he had to say 48...
I was explaining to him...
...if Charlie has said 48 then he
must have thought of something.
Sunny.
I thought about it before speaking.
It will take Debrovsky that long...
...to come here from Moscow.
Bilal, call Debrovsky.
Tell him that the gold
he's been looking for...
...for the past one year
is here in Wellington.
And if he wants it...
...then he should
come here in 48 hours.
What are you saying, Charlie?
If the Russian Mafia arrive...
...then they will take all the gold.
Our first motive to
come here was revenge...
...and not to steal the gold.
Charlie is right.
It's not about the gold.
We should call Debrovsky.
This time you stay out of it, Naina.
We stole the gold amidst
the military commandoes...
...and not you.
Charlie, shall we
accept defeat so easily.
Some things are bigger
than winning and losing, Riya.
Call Debrovsky.
Someday you will surely kill me.
Don't worry, baby.
This gun's still
loaded with rubber bullets.
You must have heard
everything through this microphone.
Charlie Mascarenhas.
What a loser.
He informed the Russian Mafia.
Sorry, baby. I couldn't hold
them for long. - It's okay.
Neither him nor the Russian Mafia...
...can reach my gold.
Our gold, not yours.
Now that's what I like about you.
Your attitude.
But, what now?
I already have.
Now that's what I like about you.
You're fast.
- Bad news.
- What now?
I have just received
news from my contact that...
...Spider has hired an armor
truck from Ace Securities.
That means he's shifting
his gold before 48 hours.
Don't panic, Sunny.
That's good news.
Now we will rob the gold
from the streets of Wellington.
Just like we did in India.
In broad daylight.
Wow.
What an idea, Charlie?
You thought of this so quickly.
Now that's what I like about you.
You are fast.
You are the fastest, baby.
What a bitch.
Now explain the plan in detail.
Plan no.1.
Sunny, get all the maps of this city.
Maps for the roads.
And maps for the
tunnels below the roads.
Bilal.
How could this be closed?
According to the map
there should be a road here.
Mark it.
Plan no.2.
Naina, tomorrow you will have to turn
Wellington to Mumbai for some hours.
Wellington's biggest traffic jam.
It will be done, Charlie.
And anyway, we Indians
love causing a traffic jam.
Plan no.3.
Riya, you begin our exit plan.
You will find a ship
with the help of Bilal...
...which we will use to
transport gold out of New Zealand.
- Here's your money.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
That's your ship.
And the most important.
We will have to arrange for cars...
...that look small but
are the fastest on road.
Amazing.
Perfect timing, Charlie.
Even with all the weight...
...the cars didn't slowdown at all.
Did you see?
The marvel of my mice.
They can get in anything,
get out of anything...
...and carry any number of weight.
If you use them in a race...
...they will surely win the gold.
That is exactly what we want to do.
There was another thing.
Tell me.
Great.
You've been promoted.
I will get all the gold in this.
- Do your legs reach down there?
- Yes.
Of course they do.
'Can I know who you are talking to? '
'She might have gone home.'
'My daughter cannot
pick up the phone.'
'There's a nurse
that stays with her... '
'... who calls me up
and lets her talk to me.'
'But if this is against your rules... '
'... then I will tell
her not to call me.'
'After all, I am doing this for her.'
'There is no such rule... '
'... that can stop a father
from talking to her daughter.'
Hey, Supergirl.
I don't want to talk to you.
Seems like Gudiya is angry with me.
Of course.
You have been fooling me
for the past one week.
"I will come soon, I will come soon."
When will you come back to me?
Soon.
And the surprise that you
were supposed to bring along?
I stayed away from you
because of that surprise.
It's a big surprise.
That's why it took
really long to get it.
And you will teach me magic when
you come this time, won't you?
I have told all my friends...
...that I will become a
magician when I grow up.
Just like my papa.
There is no one else like my papa.
- Yes or no?
- Yes, dear.
There is no one like your papa.
- Bye, dear.
- Bye.
This one's for Ronnie and Victor.
Cheers.
May the best player win.
Hurry up, boys.
Sunny, come in.
Sunny, here. Go ahead.
- Are you in position?
- Yes, of course.
I am waiting for the gold.
Charlie, you were right.
Game on, guys.
Naina, follow the truck.
Okay.
Welcome to Mumbai.
Oh no.
What the hell is going on?
Check the system.
Check quickly.
God damn it, you...
You wanted to right, didn't you?
Now you will go left.
Sunny, my job's done and yours begins.
Okay.
Come to me, my darling.
Come and give me the gold.
Move it, move it.
Ready for the race, guys.
At the count of three, sharp left.
Three.
Two.
One, go.
Oh no. Not again. God dam it.
Why are you getting angry?
Just a little bit more.
- Bilal.
- I am ready.
- Sunny, bring the truck on the mark.
- Okay.
Charlie, he's ready to
plunge in the tunnel.
Okay, bye.
See you later.
What a plan, Charlie.
I never realized
when you stole my gold.
Gift. Gift. Gift. Its here,
its here, its here.
What are you doing here?
Just do as we told you...
...and get to the place
where you were supposed to be.
Just let me see the gold once.
And then I will leave.
Sunny, the gold isn't in the truck.
The truck is empty.
Empty?
I checked the tire
pressure of the truck...
...while entering and
exiting the villa.
They were both the same.
They why did you heist this truck?
So that the bird hovering above you...
...thinks that we have
fallen for his trap.
And now he can
easily get the gold out.
That means he's shifting
the gold from somewhere else?
Let's go.
Pamela, get the gold.
- And come straight to my airstrip.
- Sure, boss.
Yes, Pamela.
We're coming out.
Yes, we're ready at the exit point.
Move.
The truck's coming.
Get ready.
Three, two, one.
Get ready to die.
That was my right.
Hello.
Hello.
Speak up you bitch.
Your bitch is gone.
You're next.
- Who?
- Your father.
I am taking your gold.
Do whatever you like.
Charlie.
Yes, boss.
Sam you fool, the
gold has been stolen.
- Go inside and kill them.
- Okay, boss.
Come on, guys.
Come on, come on, all the best.
Come on, throw it, throw it.
Great, they fell down.
- Hello.
- Charlie, where are you?
We are reaching Marina Bay.
- Is everything ready?
- Absolutely.
I am waiting for you.
Marina Bay.
Careful, guys, don't hurt them.
Surprise. Surprise.
It's become a habit for me
to bring twist in the story.
Just like it's become your habit
to become predictable, Charlie.
There's another surprise for you.
Your old friend.
You thought you met her
again in the Mini Market.
But forgive me, friends.
She was actually keeping
a watch on all of you.
Why did you do this?
I didn't have a choice, Charlie.
What could I do?
A helpless girl who had
to face the world alone...
...she had to fulfill her
dreams and of her old parents.
Isn't that the kind of
story you want to hear?
Crap. The truth is I always
wanted to be with the winner.
And that night in
Moscow's club I found my winner.
'Nervous.'
'No.'
'But this waiting is.'
'I need a drink.'
- 'Sorry.
- It's okay. '
'One apple martini please... '
'Spider, give me a cigarette.'
'I don't smoke.'
'Then whose packet is this? '
'And what is this? '
'Our exit plan after the robbery.'
'Smart, Spider.'
'What if I don't
tell this to anyone? '
Actually speaking I
did have a choice...
...and I could have told
you about Spider's plan.
But the mission was
impossible without Spider.
And what would I get in return?
Z E R O.
That means just for the money you...
Shut up. Stop this charade.
Tell me where is it?
It's a big place, it can be anywhere.
Where is my gold?
Where is the gold?
What the... Where is the gold?
Surprise. Surprise.
If the gold isn't in the
car then where is it, Spider?
Sorry, Riya.
I didn't have a choice either.
You were sitting on 500 million.
So why did you have to steal the
painting from the Wellington Museum?
'She is leaving.'
You could've retired.
But then, only
policemen retire, not thieves.
He knew. He knew everything
about you, you dumb woman.
Why are you scolding
this dumb woman, Spider?
She was helpless before her habit.
You are the real fool.
Who asked you to put up
that same stolen painting...
...in your villa?
Open the door, baby.
500 million, and what
does he put up in his villa?
A stolen painting?
There's a limit to being cheap.
Speechless after hearing all this.
But I hope your watch is working.
Tick-tock.
There's still one
hour left to 48 hours.
Do you know what your
biggest problem is, Spider?
You're always ahead.
And the one who walks ahead...
...never realize when the
entire game has changed behind them.
And as far as the twist in
the story is concerned...
...how can you forget that the
last twist belongs to the hero...
...and not the villain.
Now even a fool like you
can understand this twist.
I gave you the information
that you wanted to hear.
'Call Debrovsky.'
I knew that Spider
would come out of his web...
...after hearing
about the Russian mafia.
And you did.
How predictable.
No, Charlie.
I will tell you who is predictable.
I can point a gun at
anyone here I want.
But I will point this gun
at... the bitch who betrayed you.
What are you doing, Spider?
Quiet.
Your expiry date is gone.
And anyway, you have
already given me...
...all the information you
had to in the last six months.
And as far as loyalty is concerned...
...so when you can betray
a nice guy like Charlie...
...then how can you be loyal to me?
Chill bitch, this time there
are real bullets in the gun.
Did I break your heart?
Charlie, do you know...
...why she asked me to put up
that charade of fake bullets?
Because she didn't want to
break your heart, Charlie.
She didn't want you to
know that she betrayed you...
...before you died.
You can kill someone
but not break his heart.
Women, I tell you.
So my predictable good man.
Tell me where my gold is.
So he's the winner you chose?
Come on, Charlie. Tell me.
Tell me, Charlie.
I don't have all the time.
Tell me, Charlie, or
else I will shoot her.
You are wasting my time now, Charlie,
I will shoot her.
Wait.
I will tell you.
Riya.
Sorry, Charlie.
I didn't have a choice then.
But I do now.
Riya.
Bilal.
Hit him.
We still don't know where the gold is.
All my life I will regret
that I couldn't kill you.
Down came the rain drop
and washed the Spider out.
Chief, there's a call for you.
Okay.
Hello.
Romanian gold?
Where in Wellington?
Where? Where?
Let's go.
Which are these three cars?
Just a minute. Just a minute.
I will tell you the
test of these three cars.
So now I understand.
You left the gold filled cars here.
And took these empty cars.
Great, Charlie.
All thanks to M. C and his family.
You are Indians.
And I can even lay
down my life for Indians.
Go on, go on.
If they had waited a
little while longer...
...they could've taken
the veneration offerings.
My darling, they
have got their reward.
Now I will conduct the
veneration and give you your reward.
- Come on.
- No, no.
Come on. Saying no to offerings.
Guys, Russian Mafia.
Everyone be cool.
No one will argue with them.
Check their cars.
- But, sir, please...
- Shut up.
Understand.
Empty.
No gold.
No gold.
It's not in this car either.
Then where is the gold?
Be quiet.
You look angry.
Look, don't lock horns with me today.
I have suffered a loss of 100 million.
I put my life at stake to get
the gold and what did I get?
Zilch.
What will I tell my
father when I return home?
You have the cars for your father.
What car?
Forget this.
- Give him champagne.
- Yes, give me some poison.
Drink champagne and not poison.
At least spare this car.
That's the only memorabilia.
Oh my, it's made of gold.
And the rest of the cars?
What do you think?
Do you make cars only of
steel or iron... - Brass, copper...
...fiber, thermocol, anything you want.
- Gold.
- I...
- Gold?
- Gold.
You mean the gold wasn't in the car...
...the car was made of gold itself.
Uncle, autograph please.
People will be stunned...
...when they see the
gold tires of my car.
- Wow.
- Say it.
Open the gate, papa.
"Why is distance between us?"
"Let's come closer."
"Feel it in every breath."
"My intoxication."
"Your charm always works."
"Your beauty is alluring."
"Your Beauty makes me sway."
"I am enchanted by you."
"Your intoxication is like a dream."
"Your Beauty makes me sway."
"You dwell in my thoughts,
my questions and my answers."
"You are my desire."
"You are my passion."
"My life depends on you."
"Always stay with me."
"You have now become my habit."
"Not just my habit, but I need you."
"I take you in my and sway."
