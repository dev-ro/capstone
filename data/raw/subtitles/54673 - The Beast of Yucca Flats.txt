Joseph Jaworski,
noted scientist,
recently escaped from
behind the Iron Curtain.
Wife and children
killed in Hungary.
His aid carries a briefcase.
Secret data on the
Russian moonshot.
Joseph Jawarski's destination,
Yucca Flats,
and a meeting with top brass
at the A-bomb testing ground.
These men are also from
behind the Iron Curtain.
Two of the Kremlin's
most ruthless agents.
Their orders,
get the briefcase,
kill Jaworski.
Mr. Jaworski,
get in the car!
Flag on the moon.
How did it get there?
Secret data,
pictures of the moon!
Secret data, never before
outside the Kremlin.
Man's first rocket to the moon.
Yucca Flats...
the A-bomb.
Vacation time.
Man and wife,
unaware of scientific progress.
Joseph Jaworski,
noted scientist,
dedicated his life to the
betterment of mankind.
Young Joe Dobson,
desert patrolman.
Officer.
Yeah?
There's a man dead
back down the road.
Dead?
How far down?
A couple miles, maybe more.
Laying behind his car.
Looks like he's been choked.
Joe Dobson,
caught in the wheels of progress.
Man choked to death,
a woman's purse,
and footprints
on the wasteland.
Touch a button,
things happen.
A scientist becomes a beast.
Jim?
Be down in a minute, Joe.
Yeah, better come with me.
Trouble at the road.
-Murder.
-Be right down.
See you later, honey.
Jim Archer, Joe's partner.
Another man caught
in a frantic race
for the betterment of mankind.
Progress.
Jim Archer, wounded
parachuting on Korea.
Jim and Joe try to keep the
desert roads safe for travelers
seven days a week.
Shock waves of an A-bomb,
a once powerful, humble man,
reduced to...
nothing!
Joseph Jaworski,
respected scientist,
now a fiend,
prowling the wastelands.
A prehistoric beast
in the nuclear age.
Kill...
Kill, just to be killing.
The mouth of a cave, 1,000
feet up, over jagged cliffs.
A man murdered,
a woman's purse.
Jim and Joe
picked their way upward
to the mouth of the cave.
One slip,
and 1,000 feet to nowhere.
Well, there's the
owner of the purse.
Yeah.
Let's take her down.
May still be alive.
Yeah, she's still breathing.
Careful with her arm, Joe.
Hey, Joe!
Here, feel her pulse.
Well, doctors can't help her.
Maybe angels, but not doctors.
Paper, mister?
Get your morning paper.
Vacation time.
People travel, east,
west, north or south.
The Radcliffs travel east,
with two small boys.
Adventurous boys!
Nothing bothers some people,
not even flying saucers.
Come on, Art,
let's get some soda pop.
Hey, mister?
Ah, do you mind if we
bother you a minute?
Boys from the city,
not yet caught in the
whirlwind of progress,
feed soda pop to the thirsty pigs.
Coyotes,
once a menace to travelers.
Missile bases run 'em
off their hunting ground.
How much do I owe you?
$3.00.
Boys,
we're leaving!
Mom, we saw some real pigs.
Yeah, and a coyote.
-Coyote?
-Yeah.
Don't you be
playing with coyotes.
Now, come on.
We're leaving.
Come on.
Aw, we never get
to have any fun.
110 in the shade,
and no shade.
Jim and Joe try to make
their way up to the plateau.
To reach the top, a
man needs an airplane.
A jump from a plane
could land you on top.
But the killer's
not on the plateau.
Hours in the broiling
hot desert sun,
with no trace of the killer.
To put Jim Archer's paratroop
training to good use...
is the only answer.
A trip up into the
skies, and jump.
And if the killer is on the plateau,
kill him!
Hank,
I don't see the boys.
I'll take a look.
Jim,
shoot first, ask
questions later.
Hank,
I can't find them.
What do you think we should do?
I don't know, Lois.
Stay here, I'll go out farther.
We'll find 'em.
Randy?
Art?
Art?
Randy?
Always on the prowl,
looking for something,
or somebody to kill.
Quench the killer's thirst.
Shoot first,
ask questions later.
The pilot dropped his man.
If Joe Dobson moves north,
Hank will be
caught in the middle.
An innocent victim,
caught in the wheels of justice.
A man runs,
somebody shoots at him.
Jim Archer, ex-paratrooper,
trained to hunt down his man
and destroy him.
The hunter and the hunted.
With only a few hundred yards
between him and the enemy,
Jim closes in for the kill.
Hank, where are the boys?
Why are you running?
I haven't time to explain, Lois.
Stay here.
The boys may come back.
Gotta get help.
Joe Dobson headed
north and met Jim.
20 hours without rest,
and still no enemy.
In the blistering desert heat,
Jim and Joe plan another attack.
Find the beast and kill him.
Kill or be killed.
Man's inhumanity...
to man.
Randy, you think we're lost?
Maybe.
I don't know, Art.
Maybe.
Let's go.
Randy, is that water down there?
I sure hope so.
My throat's dry.
Mine too.
Randy?
What?
Where are we?
In a cave, I guess.
Come on, Art.
Be careful.
Think that old man
get us up here?
Don't talk about it.
Come on.
Art, get back.
The beast, finding
his victim gone...
unleashes his fury.
Art, come on.
Get back!
With Hank and some
helpful neighbors,
the search narrows.
Jim?
You all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.
Joseph Jaworski,
noted scientist.
Mom?
Mom.
Mom.
