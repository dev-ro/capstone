Jack.
Pavel.
It's been a while.
Who was the girl?
A friend.
A friend?
Who were the Swedes?
I'm working on that. It's
going to take some time.
Did she set you up?
She had nothing
to do with it.
Pity.
You can't stay here.
I've made arrangements
for you to leave town
while I sort this out.
Take a right
outside the bar.
Then second left.
Via Magenta.
You'll find a dark blue Fiat
Tempra with Pescara plates.
I've marked a small town on the map.
Castelvecchio.
Stay there. Lay low,

Don't talk to anyone.
And above all, don't

You used to know that.

I'm a photographer.
Fotografia?
Si.

Pictures of architecture,

No people.
Just for publications,

Which magazines?
Different ones.
Uh...
(IN ITALIAN)

You must share a glass of wine with me.

I'll think about it.

You study our history?

I'm Edward.
Mathilde.
Range?
150-175 meters.
Time?
Five seconds.
Seven at the most.
Targets?
One.
Firing rate?
Rapid.
Magazine capacity?
Large.
Preferably a 5.56.
The weapon must be
fairly light and compact.
How compact?
As compact as possible.
You want an automatic rifle
to fit inside a woman's purse?
A small vanity case
would be permissible.
A small briefcase
would be possible.
Noise?
Silencer.
I can only give you
a suppressor.
It'll dampen
the decibels
and dislocate
the sound source
and reduce
the muzzle flash.
I can't make you silent,
but I can make you invisible
as long as you're willing
to lose some range.
Two o'clock.
Light blue shirt,
sunglasses. Is he with you?
I didn't see him.
In any case,
I'm alone.
Ecco, il suo americano.
Grazie.
I can accept
a slight loss of range.
You want a weapon
with the firing capacity
of a submachine gun
and the range of a rifle.
Can you do it?

Did you ever want to be

Have you ever wanted to be

I do what I'm good at.
You have the hands

not an artist.
You are good

opposite when we first met.
Hmm?
Journalism
cannot make you
a rich man.
Perhaps you are
rich already?
A man can be rich
if he has God

I don't think God's very

Hello again, Edward.
Does this place
get many visitors?
This is the only way
to get here.
Did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks?
Three days ago I walked
the river, both sides.
Let's check again.
(COCKING)
Rounds?
I prepared two kinds,
10 jacketed, 10 expanding.
I'd like 20 of each.
And 10 explosive.
Not a problem.
Will mercury do?
Mercury will do
very nicely.
I brought my own target.
Right there.
Muzzle velocity?
About 360 miles an hour.
That's including 20 miles an hour
off for the sound suppression.
Ruger?
M14.
I've not had one before.
You'll find it easy.
I've re-balanced it for the
weight of the suppressor.
The fulcrum's two centimeters
forward from the grip,
but that shouldn't matter
if you're firing,
I'm assuming you are,
from a fixed position.
There's no major
recoil issues.
You should be able to hold
any target, even the smallest.
Go to the flower.
Fire into these reeds,
say, two steps
away from me.
Two bursts,
five seconds apart.
The sound suppression
is superb.
I couldn't place
the direction of fire.
I shall require the rounds and the
weapon by the first of next month.
In the meantime,
could you tighten the
adjusting screws on the sight?
They're too loose.
What about the case?
It's a briefcase. Samsonite.
Black. Combination locks.
You have a number
you prefer?
014.
014.
What do you want
done with these?
How thoughtful.
"Asprinio. ' '
I don't know it.
It's like Moscato,
only frizzante.
It wouldn't look right
if the picnic wasn't touched.
You chilled the wine,
I thought...
Had to be chilled.
Italian cops.
Don't move.
So beautiful.
It's endangered.
You like coming here.
It serves a purpose.
You've never taken a woman
here before?
No.
Perhaps you do not have
a woman in your life?
Thank you, for a lovely
day, Mr. Butterfly.

Act?
You might have to

but you don't have to

I want you to be
exactly who you are.
I came here to get pleasure,
not to give it.
Maybe I pretend very well.
You give me more tips
than the other girls get.
I don't sleep
with the other girls.
Ciao, Signor Farfalla.
How are you?
Good, thank you.
This is my friend Anna.
Hi.
Piacere, Anna.
Do you want to join me
for some coffee?
We're going to see an American
movie. Anna's learning English.
I would love
to go to America.
But perhaps we can
see each other soon?
On Wednesday I'm free.
Okay, I'll be there.
Where?
Our usual place?
Our usual place.
I forgot. (CHUCKLES)
Where is our usual place?
Let's go someplace new.
You can decide.
Locanda Grapelli?
Great!
Locanda Grapelli,
good food.
Mmm-hmm. Grapelli.
See you there?
I'll see you there.
At 8:00?
At 8:00.
ANNA: Arrivederci,

Anna, it's nice
to meet you.
JACK: Fuck.
(PHONE LINE RINGING)

JACK:
The Swedes found me.
Stay put.
Finish the job.
How the fuck did they know
I was here?
Because you've lost
your edge, Jack.
FATHER BENEDETTO:
Buongiorno!
You're up early!
I needed some air.
I walk here to meditate.
I thank God for certain
favors he has granted me,
and I ask him to look after those
of my friends who are sinners.
All men are sinners.
Some are greater sinners
than others.
But those who seek peace
have much sinning
in their history.
Maybe.
Forgive me, this is the
priest in me speaking, but
you have done much
sinning, Signor Clarke.
And you still do.
Something happened
here last night.
Everything I've done,
I've had good cause to do.
Do you wish to tell me?
To confess?
Yes.
For what reason?
For your own sake.
Perhaps I can
pray for you?
Perhaps.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I wonder how
many bastards have been made here.
You work in metal.
You were given some steel
by Fabio, the car doctor.
Where was he
conceived, Father?
Fabio, the car doctor.
Why do you ask me that?
You have each other's photos.
You have each other's eyes.
Was he conceived here, under the trees
at night, like all the other bastards?
I do not remember,
Signor.
It was many years ago.
In the end it is I
who confesses to you.
Do you want me
to do the same?
For your own good.
You cannot doubt the existence
of Hell. You live in it.
It is a place without love.
Perhaps I have no right
to wear these robes.
But I do have a heart
full of a father's love.
Something close
to his heart!
And for that I am
both grateful and happy.
What do you have,
my friend?
Ciao.
I was not sure
you were coming.
I wasn't sure
you meant me to.
Certo che si.
Buonasera. Buonasera.
Buonasera.
Grazie.
Prego.
Grazie.
Grazie.
(IN ITALIAN)
No, grazie.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Are you married?
No.
I was sure
this was your secret.
Why do I have
to have a secret?
You're a good man,
but...
(WHISPERS)
... you have a secret.

No, no, davvero.

We make love

We should have our lunch.
Ah! Ah.

are here.

The two prostitutes were
killed in Pescara, right?
Did you see what
they do to them?
The police showed me
the photographs.
I want to feel safe
with clients.
Does it make you
feel safe with me?
You're not a client.
Then why is it
in your bag?
Because I work tonight.
There's a processione.
A procession?
Yes. Tomorrow.
In Castel del Monte.
We go to this together?
Maybe.
Really?
And after...
