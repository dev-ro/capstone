You know, I thought to maybe drive up to the town.
You want something?
No.
Hunter?
Who knew they would travel in pairs, I think.
Come!
Come on!
What's going on?
You have a gun?
Why would you have a gun?
Jack!
Jack.
Jack.
Is he dead?
- Jack.
- Go to the house and call the police.
Go!
- Yeah?
- It's Jack.
I'm here.
- What do you mean 'here'?
- Rome.
There is a bar near the main station.
Cafe di Ghetto. Wait there.
- Jack.
- Papo.
It's been a while.
Who was the girl?
- A friend.
- A friend?
Those were Swedes.
I'm working on that.
It's gonna take some time.
Did she set you up?
She had nothing to do with it.
Pity.
You can't stay here.
I made arrangements for you to leave
town while I sort this out.
Take a right outside the bar. Then second left.
Near Magenta you'll find dark blue
Fiat Tempra with Pescara plates.
I've marked small town on the map.
Castelvecchio.
Stay there. Lay low till you get my call.
Don't talk to anyone.
And above all,
Don't make any friends, Jack.
You used to know that.
'Giorno!
Hello
- Where are you from?
- I?
Ah, you're an American.
- Yes, "A American."
- Not "A American ',
but' an American."
L'americano.
- Can I help you?
- I'm not good with machines
- Are you an American?
- Yes.
- Speak Italian?
- A little.
- On vacation?
- A working vacation.
Do you work?
What kind of job do you have?
I am a photographer.
- Take pictures
- Yes.
- What kind of photos?
- Pictures of architecture, landscape.
- People?
- No people.
Just publication for magazines.
Magazines? Which magazines?
- Different ones. Casa Editrice
- Okay.
You must share a glass
of wine with me.
- Come tonight.
- I can't, no.
You want to know the truth
about Abruzzo?
The priest sees everything.
- Yeah?
- It's Jack.
You don't answer the cell I gave you.
I'm not good with machines.
You don't make this
easy for me, Jack.
Gotta job for you.
It's a custom fit. You don't
even have to pull the trigger.
I'll think about it.
The quality of the brandy is good.
Smooth.
The only good thing to
come from the French.
- You study our history?
- No.
You come to Italy to make a guidebook
and you don't care about history?
- I take pictures.
- Of course.
You're American.
You think you can escape history.
You live for the present.
I try to, Father.
Hello
- I would like this cheese ...
- A wheel of Pecorino?
Okey, immediately. 12 Euros.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Here is the change.
- Thanks.
- And I thank you.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.
- What you want, sir?
- Bring me an americano.
In a minute.
- I am Edward.
- Mathilda.
- Range?
- 150 to 175 meters.
- Time?
- 5 seconds. 7 at the most.
- Target?
- One.
- Firing rate?
- Rapid.
- Magazine capacity?
- Large, Preferably a 556.
The weapon must be
fairly light and compact.
How compact?
As compact as possible.
What, an automatic weapon to
fit inside of a woman's purse?
A small vanity case
would be permissible.
Small briefcase
should be possible.
- Noise?
- Silencer.
I can only give you a supressor.
It will dampen the decibels
and dislocate the sound source.
Reduce the muzzle flash.
I can't make you silent but I can make you
invisible as long as you're willing to lose the range.
2 o'clock.
Light blue shirt. Sunglasses.
Is he with you?
I didn't see him.
In any case I'm alone.
- Your Coffee, American.
- Thank you.
I can accept a slight loss of range.
You want a weapon with a firing capacity of a
sub-machine gun with the range of a rifle.
Can you do it?
- Clark. A package.
- Clark. Of course.
I'm Clara.
Thanks. See you tonight.
All the sheep in my flock are dear to me.
But some are dearer than the most.
Especially those that have lost the way.
Fabio, mechanic.
Car doctor.
But I think his work
is not always legal.
Did you ever want to be
anything but a priest?
Have you ever wanted to be anything other than ...
photographer?
- I do what I'm good at.
-You have the hands of a craftsman.
Not an artist. You are good with machines.
Yet you told me just the opposite
when we first met. Eh?
Journalism can not
make you a rich man.
Perhaps you are rich already.
A man can be rich if he
has God in his heart.
I don't think God is very
interested in me, Father.
Fabio.
Got some damage to my car.
- Sorry, I'm busy.
- I am the friend of
father Benedetto.
- The American?
- Yes.
I'm taking photographs to the mountains.
Okey, okey.
You need beautiful model for your photos.
Pretty Italian girl.
No, I need tools for a broken drive shaft.
- Are you a mechanic?
- It's a hobby.
My garage ... your garage.
- However, you want to check a bit?
- Yes, thanks.
- How much?
- Nothing.
Thank you.
- Where's Clara?
- Not working tonight.
- Want to drink anything?
- No, thanks.
Thanks.
Got a letter from a friend.
Three dead in Dalarna
Hello again.
Is this place getting many visitors?.
This is only way to get here.
Did you check it for footprints
and tire tracks?
Three days ago I walked
the river. Both sides.
Let's check again.
- Rounds?
- I prepared two kinds.
- 10 jacket and 10 expand.
- I'd like 20 of each.
- And then 10 explosive.
- Not a problem.
- Will mercury do?
- Mercury will do very nicely.
I brought my own target.
There.
- Muzzle velocity?
- About 360 miles an hour.
That's including 20 miles an hour off
for the sound suppression.
- What model?
- M14.
I've never had one before.
You'll find it easy.
I've rebalanced it by the way due to suppressor.
The fulcrum is 2 cm forward from the grip
But that should not matter as I suppose
you'd fire it from a fixed position.
There's no major recoil issues.
You should be able to hold any
target, even the smallest.
Go to the flower.
Fire into these reeds.
Say two steps away for me.
Two bursts.
Five seconds apart.
The sound suppression is superb.
I could not place the direction of fire.
I shall require the rounds and
the weapon by the first of next month.
In the meantime, could you try adjusting
screws on the sight?. It's too loose.
What about the case?
It's a Samsonite briefcase, black.
Combination locks it. Do you have a number you prefer?
- 014.
- 014.
What should I do with these?
How thoughtful!
Asprinio. Don't know it.
It's Muscatto, only frizzante.
Wouldn't look good if.
the picnic wasn't touched.
- You chilled the wine.
- Had to be chilled.
Italian cops.
Do not move.
So beautiful!
It's endangered.
- You like coming here.
- Serves the purpose.
You've never taken a woman here before?
No.
Perhaps you do not have a woman
in your life.
Thank you for a lovely
day, Mr Butterfly.
Sergio Leone. Italian.
No.
Slowly. God.
Everything is strange.
Weird?
Yes.
It is as if ...
As if you can't stop thinking about something.
Or someone.
Mr. Farfalla ...
You don't have to act.
Act?
You might have to with other clients but
you don't have to with me.
I want you to be exactly
who you are.
I came here to get pleasure,
not to give it.
Maybe I pretend very well...
You give me my tips that the other girls get.
I do not sleep with other girls.
Hey, Mr. Farfalla.
- How are you?
- Okay, thanks.
This is my girlfriend, Anna.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Anna.
You want to join me for some coffee?
No, go see an American movie.
Anna is learning English.
I would love to go to America.
But perhaps we can see each other soon.
On Wednesday I'm free.
OK, I'll be there.
Where?
The usual place.
The usual place. I forgot.
Where is our usual place?
Let's go someplace new.
You can decide.
- Locanda Grappalli?
- Great.
Locanda Grappalli - good food.
- Grappali?
- See you there?
- See you there.
- At 8.
8.
Goodbye, Mr. Farfalla.
Anna, I was nice to meet you.
Two more murdered prostitutes.
Yes.
The Swedes found me.
Stay put.
Finish the job.
How the fuck did they know I was here?
Cause you've lost your edge, Jack.
Good morning. You're up early!
I needed some air.
I walk here to meditate.
I thank God for certain favors
he has granted me.
And ask him to look after
to those of my friends
who are sinners
All men are sinners.
Some are greater sinners than others.
But those who seek peace
are much sinning in the history.
Maybe.
Forgive me, this is the priest
in me speaking ...
but you have done much
sinning, Mr. Clark.
Are you still do.
Something happened
here last night.
Everything I've done I
had good cause to do.
Do you wish to tell me?
- To confess?
- Yes.
For what reason?
For your sake.
- Perhaps I can pray for you.
- perhaps.
I wonder how many bastards
have been made here
You work in metal ...
You were given some steel by Fabio ...
The car doctor.
Where was he conceived, Father?
Why do you ask me that?
You have each others photos.
You have each other's eyes.
Was he conceived here under the trees
at night like all the other bastards?
I do not remember, sir.
It was many years ago.
In the end, it is I
who confesses to you.
You want me to do the same?
For your own good.
You can not doubt the
existence of hell.
You live in it.
It is a place without love.
Perhaps I don't have the right
to wear these robes...
But I have a heart ...
full of a father's love.
Something close to his heart.
And for that, I'm both
grateful and happy.
What do you have?
My friend?
On time.
I was not sure, you know,
you were coming.
I was not sure you meant me to.
Of course yes.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Can you bring us a bottle
of mineral water and a Montepulciano?
English menu?
No, thanks.
German, Dutch?
Gentleman speaks Italian
as good as me.
I repeat: a bottle of mineral water
and a bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.
- With gas?
-No
People from the provinces...
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
You're married?
No.
I was sure this was your secret.
Why do I have to have a secret?
You're a good man, but ...
You are a secret.
Excuse me.
No. No, thanks.
No. He thinks that
we are a couple.
- It's all right.
- Thank you.
Hello.
I need some more time.
You're testing my patience.
Just give me a few more days.
You have two days.
Then you make a drop.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Where we go?
Someplace beautiful.
We go to a picnic?
- Picnic.
- Yeah, a picnic.
I have to practice my English.
Today we're going to have a picnic.
It is a beautiful day.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
I think it is good we
stay close to the road.
Don't worry, I've been down
this road many times taking photographs.
- Only you come here?
- Yes.
It is a paradise.
I'm going to swim in the water.
You come?
It is cold.
Maybe.
Come, Mr. Farfalla.
Is beautiful, no?
We make love in water ...
What is wrong?
Should eat.
Look. It's a bullet.
I don't think so.
Edward ... is it your real name?
Can you put this behind?
What?
Nothing.
- Grazie
-  ust don't understand what the
hell are you doing with a gun.
A friend of mine gave it to me.
The two prostitutes
were killed in Pescara, right?
Did you see what they do to them?
The police showed me the photographs.
I wanted to feel safe
with clients.
Does it make you feel safe with me?
You're not a client.
- Then why is it in your bag?
- Because I work tonight.
It is a "procession".
- A procession?
- Yes. Tomorrow
Want to do this together?
Maybe.
Really?
And after? After that,
tomorrow, the next day ...
I can not stay forever, Clara.
- It's time to go.
- Take me home with you.
I can't.
Yeah?
I'll make the delivery,
then I'm out.
Palo?
Okay, Jack.
You're out
Hello?
Now you listen to me carefully...
A coffee.
I see you've brought it in with you.
Everything is here, as we agreed.
What is this?
Thought you might
have a sweet tooth.
That's very kind of you.
I guess I'll be reading about it
in the "Tribune"?
Yes. I expect so.
I'm just going to
the ladies. Wait here.
- You okay?
- I'm fine. You?
Just fine.
You won't need a gun.
You never know.
Final payment.
Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.
Hello?
What happened?
There wasn't any opportunity.
Find one.
I'm following it now.
I was looking for you.
I'm here.
What are you doing tonight?
I work tonight.
Don't.
If I ask you to come
away with me, would you?
Come away with you?
Why not?
- Together?
- Together.
- Forever?
- Forever.
I want you to take this and
meet me at the river.
- Eduardo?
- Go! Go!
Who?
For the same man ...
as you Jack.
Yes
I'm sorry, Father.
Eduardo!
Eduardo!
Eduardo!
