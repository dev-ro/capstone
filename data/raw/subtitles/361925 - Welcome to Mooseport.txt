A regional
Let's give our big Mooseport welcome
to our new citizen: Monroe Eagle Cole
Thank you, thank you very much
As you all know,it's been over a
year since I had vacation here
So first of all,to the rumour that I'm
only here because I lost my Baltimore
house in my divorce...
Absolutely true.
I'm a Mooseport resident
and even though I didn't get the chance
to meet many of you when I resorb here,
as a president...
...I certainly hope to...
I certainly would ...
-(sorry)
...hope to get to know you
all a lot better
May we could hit a few birdys or eagles.
Anyway, since I'am not here to ask for money
ah, I don't know whatelse to say,
...except to thank you so much for your
hospitality, and see you around the bird
Let's go
Thank you for your participation.
Mr president, that's great.
Would you have a few minutes for private?
The president has arranged all
the time. Sorry
This just takes a second, Sir
A kind of urgence
Certainly
-Thanks, this way
Excuse me
Mr president,I'm sure the time isn't
better. But it seems you arrival has
coalesced something of crisis
Bok sends the crisis of moisture
Shall I call the Marines
Please sit down.
Thank you
Mr president, Ameer Haman,our beloved
Mayor 24 years,just past away
Oh,I'm sorry to hear that.
Anyway, sir, the town council met an
hour ago in an emergency session,
and voted you anonymously,
you sir,to be our Mayor.
Your Mayor?
ho
Souns good.
yeah, sir, before he died, Mayor Haman
was running as always and opposed with
a final deadline tomorrow
We'll have an idely time
trying to find a replacement
And,Robin here, said why we not
get the president.
I said "get the president"
Our 240 years history will now be great
honur to persuade you on our town.
The head of our town is the most
popular president in history
With the approve of ...70%
-80%
ah, 85%. -85%
85%? unbelievable
Mr president, you simpy must say "yes"
ah,  even I'm not in the office
any longer, I do have plans.
Sally, please, we are in the meeting of
something here.
-Sorry, I just get my coat,I'll come back
ah,hold on a second.Sally, is it?
Yes
Sally, you seem like engaged citizen?
What do you think if I'll be a Mayor?
Mayor? really
And it's my idea!
ah, I think you should do it.
And maybe you could do something
about landing situation.
Landing situation?
Yeah, I'm a veterinarian.
I had a critically ill donkey in my
helicopter this morning.And I almost lost
her because the president has to land first.
Oh,I'm terribly sorry. I didn't realize
that.It must be a procedural thing.
Standard security probably caused
Standard security
Maybe if you are a Mayor, you could
do something about that.
Absolutely,things like that shouldn't happen.
I appreciate your opinion
It's really,really nice to
meet you. Mr president.
Nice to meet you too, Sally
Thank you
Thank you
Well, Mr president...
I'm sorry, gentleman, this's just
Don't... Hold on a second,maybe..
-Excuse me, Mr president,I suggest we
give them the answer tomorrow.
Gentleman, he'll think of it.
Yes, I'll sleep on it
So, will we hear  from you morning, sir?
You have my word. You have the eagle's word
Thank you, Mr president
That's the way he is on TV
Hey, sorry, water tank broke again
Oh, still a water tank?
No,no, you look good.

Yeah, I did,but it would be more late
I didn't think it was bad
You can't smell you own smell that is
what it is going on here.

Hey,what you want to do?
Do you want something to eat?
No, I'm not hugry. It's time to go home.

Finally, wonderful
And you can take that job,if you
wanna take.  -fabulous
Oh, ah, about the Mayor thing
Don't worry,Mr president. we'll
take care it.
Wow, the president is a slider ,
respetc the crowd..,
Actually, I'm considering it.
Sir?
Oh, why not?  Market serves value.
the work involved you
can do.
I mean we run everything out we
involved them. Why not Mooseport?
Well, Sir...  -Firs involved in
office, you become a mayor?
It's beneath you. And from your peer's
point of view,it's..  -Fantastic
A lot of public service, Eagle Cole,
most beloved president since Kennedy.
agreed to help,perfect.
And don't forget the weak with the
west wing,he can't claim a vacation
as I'm a mayor, can he?
-True.     -Won't you find the deadline
and tell them the good news.
Yes,Sir
Thank you,thank you very much.
Gentleman, I won't let Mooseport down.
You have the eagle's word,OK?
Thank you Mr President.Goodbye now.
Bye
It's my idea!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Do you want to read this?
Handy,the rap
Thank you so much for meeting
with us again,Sir
When we talked last night,
nobody else put in for Mayor.
But Hondinen Schweiz, who can't register,
took apart herself to persuade Handy Harrison
Are you nominating Handy Harrison,
who owns a hardware store,doing something
with construction with my home,I believe.
Can run for Mayor as well
well,OK then,you got your Mayor,
You want it happened.
Oh, Mr president,things are more complicated
than  that.   -What is comlicated?
ah,it's just...  you see sir, we can't
get rid of the press.
What press?
well..., when the deadline past,
we called the hotline in the Moose Call.
She should want this got this all
around,it'll be national news,
of course it'll be a national news,
first say, I'm  trying to squash a bug
You can rest assured that not one of
them  said anything like that, did they?
No, sir,none of them said that.
A couple of them call that "beat them glair",but none of them saild that!
What do you mean"them"?
Who is "them"?
MBC, CBS
Fox,it's really exciting
What about you telling me the entire
country thinks about me for a mayor
with the man installing my toilet!
Sure,you said it's eagle's word.
Hell!
Stop eating the food,
go over there!
Somebody is coming and Bruce
is out again
Who is this?
It's Bruce,Sir,Handy's pet
Should it be in a zoo?
Good afternoon,Mr president
Hello, Handy
Can we help you with anything?
Is there everything OK with water heater?
Everything is fine,I'm just wondering
if you have a maid.
Hi, I'm Bob,I'm working for you too.
Bob,nice to see you.
I'm sorry, Mr president,
Bob,Morris and Irma
Morris,Irma,  -Paint!
Paves, -What products like you
last two cabinets appointment?
Handy,ain't you going to introduce me?
Ur,sorry, this is Mandy
How are you?
Mandy and Handy,are a queue
Could we speak privately for a moment?
Yeah, sure.That's my office over there
Outstanding!
Excuse me,I have a private meeting
with the president.
A goo on your left.Sir
Goo,what a dump
Sir, this is it
It's cosy, nice office,yeah?
Thank you.
How can I help you, Mr president?
well,Handy, as I'm sure you know,
we both put on mayor
No, I didn't know that, Sir.
You didn't know that?
I mean I did put eye... I thought
I was just doing the town a favour,
thatis all,you know,it's all
running by myself.
Well, as you can see, we have
a bit of situation.
Yeah,It's...we got a bit of pickle
a bit of peacle,exactly
So,I was thinking one of us should
withdraw now,I would be happy it were me.
Nothing left to prove much less than a Mayor or anything.
But I have a P.R proplem
Oh,P.R problem?Is it serious?
It got out to the press that I've
given my word.  -Ah, right.
You know,"you have the Eagle's word"
Right, like on TV.
Tv,exactly
So, oh, look, you're gulfer,right?
Are you andy good?
I get around,I get around. 10 hits in a cave maybe in a good day.
10? me too. We shoud knock aroud sometime.
Yeah,that'll be my honour.Mr president.
Well, if you tried to make a name for
yourself in gulf,
you wouldn't start off by...
Wow,nice shot.
...challenging Tiger Woods. You start
small,local terms. Same as politics.
You don't start political career by
running against former president of united states.
Fine.
Fine?
It's a privilege to run,
it's a privliege to withdraw.
All settled.
What's settled?
We both put in Mayor,
so I just withdraw.
Chicken
I'm glad I could help that P.R
problem, Sir.
Bruce is out of his pen again.
Did anybody put him there?
No, he ran through the rope.
Bob,won't you put him back.
I already did it.
Oh,excuse me, sorry.
Sally.
The president. We just had a meeting.
We met last night when I have been there.
Ah,look. I'm sorry for my rude to
you. I'm really embarrassed.
Rude? don't be silly.No, in fact,
what you said have convinced me to be a mayor.
Really?
Do you going to do it?
You will be our Mayor? Great!
Yes,it is, isn't it?
I'm so glad too.
You know, I've thought to get a dog.
I thought you've already had a dog.
Yes,I do. A great animal.
She need a friend.
I can not find a few available
Let's say...
Tomorrow night,perhaps,we can
discuss it over a dinner.
Dinner?
I can really use your professional
advise
Really? My advise?
hum.
Ok,well,dinner will be fine.
Great, looking forward to it.
My people will get in touch
with your people
I...dont' have people.
But I can give you my number.
well,my people will get your number,
and we set up time.
I'm sure whatever time we do that,
You'll be... on time.
Oh..
Absolutely!Looking forward to it
See you then ,sir,and thank you
again for being so helpful.
Yeah,right
Your meaning role is over.
sally.
You know,Bruce is a baby.
baby likes to choose things,like rope
Sally.Is it me or did you just
get it by the president guy.
Yes, I think I did.
How could he choose from us
And,is it me or did you just say
"yes"to the president guy?
Yes, I think I did
Look, Sally, I'm sorry that I was
late. OK,But you can't take the
president because of that.
Did you really think that is the reason?
Why? then.
My heart
Use this
Shut up!
Sally, I want to talk to you.
Sally.I want to talk!
Mr president
Yes,Handy,what it is?
Mr president
Thank you very much
I can't do it.I can't draw back
from the Mayor race
Excuse me?
I ...don't have the eagle things like
you, but I'm a man of my word too.
And every man's word is important
Is it natural?
Does he want money? Otherwise
what is it
If you stay in the race,I'm sure
you're going to score off me.But...
I'm running for the Mayor
of Mooseport
Ya...hoo!
He's loosing his money?
What's just happened?
You are running against
the president
And your girl friend ditchs you.
Ur hum.
I repeat.Ur hum!
No, the president has no comment.
No,no comment.Thank you.
That's all network's
The handyman's girl friend?
His girl friend?Why didn't you tell me
I won't look like a idot
I tried to tell you Mr president.
Remember?
Why didn't you try harder?
What must I to do now?
Appologize?backdown?
You want to call Bert Langdon?
For what?I don't need a campaign
manger for this.
Hello, one second.
Mr president.Bert Langdon on line 1
Bert,what a coincident.
Oh,well,that's what I gonna ask you.
Eagle
It's dead mission I'm here.I'll be
happy to roll up my sleeves
and come up there if you want.
Bert, I'm running against my plumber.
Is there something I don't know?
You watching Fox News?
The results are quite interesting.
The poll of course is preliminary,but it
does Harrison was surprising strong.
There are 8% margin error and it's still
early. But it looks to be very close.
Seems to me that president has got
himself a good horse race.
Eagle,you with me?
Don't you mean "lose race"?
Eagle,Hey!
Oh hu oh!
Are you Sally Mannis.  -Yeah
Could I ask a question about Handy Harrison.
Are you now dating the president?
No,I'm dating the president.
It's one date. And I'm even not
sure  you should call it a "date"
You don't call it a "date"?
What would you call it exactly?
Can you answer us a couple of
questions? We won't ask you hours
Have you and the president had
sex yet?
Who got sex!
Think about it Handy. Our Mayor, we
could have the president of the united
states!
What are you trying to tell us?
Come on,guys. You know he's
going to win
You're bad.You bastard!
Come on.   -Thank you Reuben
And you'd better keep an eye.
You're bananas, Harrison
Handy,Handy...
What's this,come on!
What's going on?
What's it look like?
Your campaigner!
Handy,Handy
Guys,come on.
Hey,Handy.Do you like it there?
Oh,That's... yeah. Guys, Thank you  very
much in the moo's head and everything.
But Irma.We disgust this.
I'm not compaigning.I'm not.
What?
Do you care about Sally or not
Look,her going out with him,
it's... just a kind of...
Call a postman a parcle in two
vasion.It's just my opinion. Lose
the election,lose Sally.
Is that going to go anywhere,Ok?
He's like 20 years older than me.
He is a president
So
Power takes 10 years off a man
Handy.
Rich, another 10.
By timing you figure he's in
great shape,you are not. He is
younger than you are.
So,you want a campaign or not?
Better shape
I know I can kick your ass.
How do we keep this thing offerd?
obviously it's to keep him presidential
Just pound these mooseporters,what his
unbelievable experience can bring to them.
Look at it,think about for
half an second.
Harrison can't bring even a
function  what he brings.
What ever he is.
And what excatly is he
preliminary research said he is
something that actually we have
never faced before, Mr president?
And that is?
He is generally honest man,Sir
Come on, Grace.All that means he
has never run for public office
What you got? Bert
FBI,CIA,nothing
And this turned up in a local paper
-And...  -That's it.
That's it? We're running against
a pie-eating champinon?
But think about this
He runs for Mayor,but only when he
think he is on the post.
He dates the same woman for 6 years,
but he never pops the question.
What's wrong with the picture?
He won't take risks
He won't make commandment
And any man who won't make a commandment
shouldn't be a mayor or anything.
That's good, how could we get it out?
whisper campaign first, then radio,and
eventually,we'll have to have some TV surport.
Shouldn't get too expensive,but..
Mr president,I'm sure you don't
want to hear this.
But would the easiest thing be...
Should we discuss our withdraw?
Withdraw?
Grace.He is the eagle
Eagle Cole has never run away
from anything in his life.
Now imagine what we'll do
with finances
finances
Book deals,quarter board,library
fund raising, you quit,
you quit,got help us lose to promote
we can't keep so still and say goodbye
fast you can see a road-roller.
Mr President,this is not about
Mooseport, it is about winning!
It's about spending 3 million
dollars to protect 20.
Maybe I should come and speak to her.
I...I canceled that Sir.
You.. what?
It...seems obvious we are right in
the middle of campagin.
-It was millions of dollars.
Well, sir,there is still that offer
from the Super Motor's people
Bullard,the ex-president of United
States can not do car commercial.
Oh,have you seen the car, Mr president
Look at this,it's steepy-style.
and snappy president.And...
--Bullard
smooth head line,leathering steering..
Bullard!
Get out!Get out!
I'll handle the money,Eagle.
I'm sure there will be library pledgers
something will turn up.
May I sit down, Sir?
Go in the corner,out of my eyeline
Thank you sir
I can still see you.
Yes, sir.
What about the girl? What about
Sally Handy,Sally Eagle.
He'll have to cancel the date.
Wow,no,he can't cancel the date.
You said that,Bert.The Eagle
doesn't back down.
You clear up what I didn't know,when
I didn't know it.I will be fine.
Shall I tell the press list,
Mr  president.  -Yeah, oh, no,no.
Call the press,have more over here in
the morning,and get Handy Harrison
here to fix the toilet.
You see what I'm going with this,
Do I have to draw you a picture.
I see, Mr president,am I?
Let's get to work
come in
Let's go,let's go. move on
through. Move on home.
Looks like at airport.
Handy,what are you going to do?
Good morning, Handy
Good morning,Mr president,you
got toilet trouble,right?
Handy,ah.I want to make it clear
that when I asked miss Mannis out,I have
no idea that you two have relationship
And even though I found it reprehensible
for any man in the experience I'm going
romance    -me too
I also believe that woman's heart
is hers and hers alone to give.
Ah,it's a good point
So,I asked Sally out in ignorance
and she agreed to go
Until she tells me she stands down,
I intend to see her,there.
Call him howling dog!
What did she say? Howling dog?
Well...if it's OK with you,sir,
let's chew on that I bet   -OK
OK, you chew on that, and ...
if you find that you can't swallow it,you  let me

Good point.

How many time I've got to tell you how
strong you are. You knock my bone.
Listen，explain to me the underwear chioce,right?

No，I won't have a debate.I would
bother the President with that.
No，no, debate is fine by me.

Well, now it's not the time and place,
Handy.But let's say the town hall,Tuesday night?
That's a great idea.
All right,I'll think about it.
Of course,he will
Tuesday,town hall
OK，all right.
OK,why not we let everybody get
back to the dinner?
All right
I'm going to the bar,you know.Maybe these

How do we fix this?
We don't. We concentrate on substance.
We get rid of those with debate.
What's wrong with the debate?
We put it more stage with you, give you some
credibility,Eagle. -And it can be funny Sir.
Funny is your weakness.
Ah，less strength.

We got to have a second debate，
how about it?
No
Mr President，
My nose is making  whisking noise.
Sorry
Nice fellow of Americans
Welcome to the first of two televised
Mayor debate
In the ground of Mooseport tradition
a game of rock,paper,scissors,will determin
who answer question first.Gentleman,
Handy，Mr President
You know the rules?
Rock

Oh，come on
Rock to scissors,the president won!
I'm now to prepare to entertain question
from the floor.
I got one.
Clay!
Some of the environment people have
taken the column near Barker's pond the wet land
I have been fishing there for 30 years
what's going to happen?
Clay，I was the most environmentally
President since FD Roosevelt
Human population will not threaten
wild life...
In this area for 200 years,if ever
So you go right on fishing in that pond,
if there's anybody trying to stop you,you
send them to me,all right?
Handy
Come on,Handy,come on
That's well point,Mr President.
It sounds good to me
Hey，Handy,come on,
Francis
For 10 years now, we have needed a stop
sign for the Lucy Decker'house
And she has done everything except
burn down city hall to stop it.
If that's it，what we'll do about it?
First of all，I'll convey a commision
to study the problem
I would  apoint a buller and pound of
traffic specialist,right way
and I'll call a engineer to assess the
situation and make recommendations
I'll spare no effort to make our street
the safest in the world!
Handy，you turn.
That's well point ,Mr President
Lucy，let me ask you,
what's the problem.
Car head lights.
10 years ago, they tried stop sign
when cars on Bit Street stoped ,their head
lights right stop right on my headboard.
Have you tried curtains?
Excuse me?
You know，blackout curtains for your windows,
you probably sleep better any way.
Well,I'll try that,nobody else suggests that.
Well,you come by the store,and
we'll help you out.
I'll do that
Mandy,you got one?
It's just a question for Handy，is that OK?
Well，if the president has no objection
I reserve the right to repond,but no objection.
OK,Mandy
Handy，I was just wondering，now that
Sally is dating the president,
Does that mean you are available?
OK，people,can you keep the question
into the subject of election.
Now, I think Goe has a question somehow..
Actually，I'm more like to address the issue,if am I？
Thank you,thanks Mandy,for
that question.
Sally,I know I may not be the best
boy friend,but...
But I thought we have good things
on going here.
You got to know how much I care
about you，right?
The only thing I got so mad is about your
underwear with the president
Underwear?
What's the problem?
No,no,no, it's the colour,
it's the colour.
Sally,what's the deal? Are you
going with him or me?
Go for the Eagle!
Sally，with the president!
Eagle!,Eagle!...
Stop it!Stop it!
Sally
Excuse me,excuse me
TBS，can I ask a question
about the underwear?
Sally，Sally
Are you crazy?
You didn't answer phone .
You took the key from the frog.
I can't believe you just did that
I can't believe it!  -How about what I
said? Does it mean anything?
I heard you talking about my underwear
in front of the whole town.
The whole country！that's how much I care
Wait a minute! You didn't answer
the question！
What question？
Is it me or him?
Is it me or your new truck?
Don't try make this all about me!
Handy,it's about you!
How？How is that about me?
Hey,she pushed you right down
Yes，she is stronger than me.
not  about me!it's about you!
How？How is that about me?
Well you heard here first.
It looks like Sally is going to catch her
bell in favour of the president.
I'm Christi，TBNN News

So，what do you think?
Should I set up another date or what?
Why not ?
Execuse me
Grace，Grace
Well,what's her problem?
Maybe she saw the numbers.
You may have done all right with the girl,
but the debate is a disaster
What are you talking about?
It's impossible.
It's a small tow,Eagle.
The rule is different here.
Ah，will you guys give some brain storm.
Well
Ah...Sir,
Excuse me,Mr President
Yes
We could lay down him
What ？
You want to make it look like an accident
at course, but...maybe his brake goes out
Oh,my god.
Or we can slick on it,oil slick
What are you? insane?
No，Sir，We're just brain storming
Do I misunderstand the question?
Thank god，you guys are in our side.

there is your stuff.
What you said ？my stuff?
Hold on,hold on,this is yours
Remember?From me
Christmas
Don't you remember there was a power

You couldn't turn this on and watch it
and the power came back,we turned it on,and...
You looked so beautiful
by the light of it
And then we ...
You know, by the light of it
I remember
and we stayed up all night and talked
Yeah..
You remember what we talked about?
Yeah... No...
The future
We talked about the future,Handy

Good luck to debate

2 minutes, Mr President
Excuse me，Sir
Hand shake
relax
I'll briefly finish
2 minutes, Handy
Yeah
Be on your toast,be sharp.You may
have won your first debate,but it's a pay down.
Gentlemen, I believe we are ready
It's starting
Live from the seaport town,the  Mooseport,the Mayoral dabate!
With the candidates,Monroe Eagle Cole and Harold Handy Harrison
We take your now moderater,
Henry Hitower
Good evening,I'm Hitower
I'me honoured to moderate the second
and final Mooseport mayoral debate.
As a tradition，we'll start with the
game of rock,paper,scissors.
Handy,not scissors
Gentlemen...
Mr Hitower,could I...，I'd like to make
a statement first.Is that ok?
Mr President？
Oh，that's fine,I...I have a statement also.
Just...,Ok? thank you.
Yes,getleman
Hey,Hi,everybody
Hi,Handy
I just want to say one thing
I'm a little embarrassed about the way
I have been running my campagin.
An election,it shouldn't be about personalities,
you know,or gulf
or who was dating,
Sally，if you watching this,
I was wrong to bring our relationship been to this.
I'm sorry
Oh...   -I guess I did it again,
I just brought our relationship been to it again.
So,I'm sorry for that，too
I guess,what I want to say,folks,I thik
an election should be about the town.
It should be about what we need and how we can
work together to get things done.
The president can do great things for us
Son of bitch！
Having him as a Mayor，that's an oppounity we can't pass off.
Tomorrow morning,I'm going to the polls,
I'll cast my vote for the president.
Monroe Cole，for the Mayor of Mooseport
Son of bithch
Ladies and gentlemen
What you've just seen is a selfless act.
Handy Harrison，is Mooseport
He thinks He is Mooseport
He knows its problems
He knows his ports
He knows his plumbing
As only a person who lives here can
So tomorrow morning，I'm going to the polls
and I'm walking into that booth,that simple piece of paper
that our forefathers gave their lives to secure
Ah....
and I'm casting my vote for Harrison,
Harold Handy Harrison,over there.
Man，he is great.
What you've just seen,ladies and gentlemen,
this politics is finest,politics should be.
very good
Harrison
We did same thing,Mr President
You son of bitch,you knew I got to do that,so you did it first.
I didn't know that,how can I know that?
You bug me
What we have just witnessed here on this rare night
You bug me
I didn't do anything.
It just showed us dencey
Let me go
It showed inclusiveness
Handy
It showed a neutral respect
Get off me
It's time to follow their example，it's time...
Mr President, are you OK?
Get off of Mr President
Get off me
So,Danny,see that debate last night?
Did I,was anybody hurt?
What?
When the screen split up,apparently an minor bruise
Any idea what had happended back there?
They are saying there was a freak accident
It's very freak
Apparently stage region just snaped and
fell the candiates where they were shaking hands.
Wow，well, you know we say
It's Mooseport

How about the little music
Good idea
Morning president
Cloud，pull it away
How is your nose？
It's OK
How is your lip？and back?
It's just the lip and it's fine.
I just assumed you back hurt,
you know, I jumped on it.
well, say you the poll.
Whould ahead of you
But，discard them in the water?
Yeah，Martha is into scoop bin,as soon as
she brings her wet suit,she'll get them
Somehow,I can picture Martha in the wet suit.
Yeah，you are lucky,I can not picture
All right
Oh，You tightly hold it
Here，let me show you,Mr President
You have shaken a lot hands.
You，shake hands with the club
Like this?

I just put the ball,and picture like
it's a former first-lady.
Just wipe it
Blood sucking vampire
Wow, you two had issues
Haw...Jesus
So,how can you not ask her?
Ask what ?
Oh,I don't know,I probably should have..
scared, I guess.
well,marriage is a sacry thing
I'll be the first one to tell you that
But once a while， there comes along that special girl
I know what you mean,that she did.
She is special
I just think，eventually，she will find somebody else.
You know，you always hope that next guy will be some loser.
not the president
Handy，the 16 toll of our match,you laid up.
yeah,I remember it.
You played the safe
So you won
I never would be a president of United States,if I laid up
Sometimes, you just got a goal for the green.
For sake of all
Out the way，out the way
No comment,No question
Handy
Over there
Once a politician
（tick himself)
Always a politician
It's 10 minutes pass the hour,and there are
20 minutes left before the polls closes in Mooseport Min.
With the former president campagin spending millions on TV,
radio and other advertising,it's amazing that Handy harrison...
It was so beautiful
Hello
Oh...I was thinking about...
For once,don't talk please,
What ？
Just listen,OK,can you do that?
A long while back
My mum asked me what I thought on you?
You probably find it's hard to believe this.
Any way,could ask such thing,but she did.
I seen a man as admirer，I told her
A fraud man,certainly,but a man with principles
Since the Handy thing
I have seen a man who only cares about Eagle and power
A man who was stood to anything to
win a position he doesn't even want.
Who someone he probably shouldn't even beat.
and it angries me,and it upsets me.
Mostly,it just made me sad
Grace...
Because you used to be better than that  Monroe.
You really were
Cole

Sugar,Mr President
