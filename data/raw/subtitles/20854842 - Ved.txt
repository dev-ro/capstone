<b>Love!</b>
<b>Love is like the tides in the sea,</b>
<b>sometimes high,</b>
<b>sometimes low.</b>
<b>Love is like a handful of sand...</b>
<b>Your hand is full,
until you hold it tight,</b>
<b>open, and it's gone.</b>
<b>Love is like an ocean,</b>
<b>some get to surf the waves,</b>
<b>some get stranded on the shore.</b>
<b>But love is unique...</b>
<b>Some fall in love madly...</b>
<b>some become the madness, in love!</b>
<b>Namaskar (Greetings!)</b>
<b>Hey, move away,</b>
<b>idiots!</b>
<b>Namaskar!</b>
<b>I welcome you all to the finals
of our 'District World Series'.</b>
<b>Namaskar, my name is Suresh!</b>
<b>It's the final match of
our 'District World Series'.</b>
<b>I too welcome you, Namaskar!</b>
<b>What a lovely shot!</b>
<b>-And Bhaskar Anna's buffaloes...
-Bulls...</b>
<b>They are bulls.</b>
<b>Bhaskar Anna's Bulls have
set the field on fire.</b>
<b>Go man... chase the ball... Run... Run...</b>
<b>Chandu is chasing the ball...
and the ball is luring chandu...</b>
<b>And that's a four...</b>
<b>'Bhaskar Bulls' is seven-time winner
of this tournament.</b>
<b>Is it so?</b>
<b>So, let's see how long can the 'Yuva
11' team face this seven-time winner.</b>
<b>Ramesh ji...</b>
<b>your language is quite impressive.</b>
<b>-I mean, your vocabulary is quite strong.
-Yes, I know...</b>
<b>I am sure, they will win this match
and set a new record for themselves.</b>
<b>Was my commentary equally impressive?</b>
<b>And here comes,</b>
<b>MLA Bhaskar Anna... Future MLA...
we warmly welcome him.</b>
<b>Start the music...</b>
<b>Long live... Bhaskar Anna...</b>
<b>Long live... Bhaskar Anna...</b>
<b>[indistinct chatter]</b>
<b>Bhaskar Anna is now on the stage...</b>
<b>He now has a bird's view of the field.</b>
<b>His hands are on his hips...
His personality is quite dashing.</b>
<b>Okay stop it.</b>
<b>You may take your seat Anna...</b>
<b>I guess, he took his seat, a bit
too swiftly, before I could announce.</b>
<b>Are these players any good?</b>
<b>Or just Buffaloes as
their name suggests?</b>
<b>Anna...</b>
<b>it's always wise to set
the exam paper, than studying.</b>
<b>What do you mean?</b>
<b>We have bribed the umpire...</b>
<b>We will win this final match.</b>
<b>And... bullseye, the ball
hits the stumps...</b>
<b>-No ball.
-How's my vocabulary?</b>
<b>The Umpire doesn't seem to
be interested... let's carryon ...</b>
<b>Ramesh, I feel...</b>
<b>Bhaskar Anna will
surely win this match.</b>
<b>As he has fixed this match.</b>
<b>Err... I meant...</b>
<b>I meant... his team
is determined to win.</b>
<b>As an ardent fan,
I can see it happening.</b>
<b>The score is 196.</b>
<b>Shambu is at the striking end.</b>
<b>That was a scintillating sixer.</b>
<b>Whoa...</b>
<b>That's another four...</b>
<b>That was a pull shot...</b>
<b>This shot is new to me...
but this one is quite good.</b>
<b>Bowler is ready to bowl...</b>
<b>and batsman is ready to hit.</b>
<b>I see the umpire scratching...
Hey you...</b>
<b>I guess the second
inning has just begun.</b>
<b>Sir, why do you keep scratching?</b>
<b>Yuva team has to face a
massive target of 283 runs.</b>
<b>That's the first ball.</b>
<b>How was that!?</b>
<b>Is he out?</b>
<b>-Out.
- The umpire declared 'out'...</b>
<b>That was an awesome drive...
I guess it was a cover drive.</b>
<b>That's the next delivery...</b>
<b>The player tried hard to
come forward and hit the ball.</b>
<b>And our Anna lost another wicket...</b>
<b>I am sure, Anna is not too
happy seeing this.</b>
<b>That was a swift pull shot.
I guess they will score two runs...</b>
<b>The player tried hard
to score the 2nd run.</b>
<b>How was that!?</b>
<b>And... he is out!</b>
<b>He is out!</b>
<b>Hey, he is not out...</b>
<b>But the umpire has declared 'Out'.</b>
<b>Satya, do something man,
they are cheating.</b>
<b>But the umpire is always right.</b>
<b>There goes the next delivery...
That was a good shot...</b>
<b>The score is 22 in 3 overs.</b>
<b>There goes the next delivery...</b>
<b>Out!</b>
<b>Batsman Santosh who works at PWD,
just got eliminated by LBW.</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Bhaskar's men have
bribed the Umpire.</b>
<b>That's an impressive
dive by the batsman.</b>
<b>yet he is out...</b>
<b>Another wicket gone.</b>
<b>That's cheating man, he was not out.</b>
<b>the score is 53 for 6 wickets.</b>
<b>-Come on...
-Hold on...</b>
<b>Pass on your Bluetooth...</b>
<b>Here, use this and give the other
one to the other player.</b>
<b>Give me your phone...</b>
<b>Here, keep this.</b>
<b>Go... and do as I direct.</b>
<b>That's the end of the Honeymoon.</b>
<b>Do as I direct...</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Come on boys...</b>
<b>Third man, step in...
Fine leg, go behind...</b>
<b>He is going to bowl shot,</b>
<b>go for pull shot.</b>
<b>That's our speed bowler...</b>
<b>And... that was an impressive
pull shot... and that's a sixer.</b>
<b>Fine leg is behind...
Long leg is inside...</b>
<b>He will deliver a bouncer.</b>
<b>Go for an upper cut.</b>
<b>That's another sixer.</b>
<b>Played for four runs.</b>
<b>Bhaskar Bulls is
now in deep trouble...</b>
<b>The next delivery
will be a good length,</b>
<b>in the line of stumps...</b>
<b>Step out and hit it.</b>
<b>The batsman moves forward
to hit the ball...</b>
<b>and that's another sixer...</b>
<b>Shattering Six...</b>
<b>Good shot!</b>
<b>The air leaks from the gap
between my teeth...</b>
<b>Ah... that's because
there is no gap in your case.</b>
<b>Go for a late cut...</b>
<b>-Whoa! that's a four.
-Upper cut...</b>
<b>Sixer...</b>
<b>Oh God, this is a miracle...</b>
<b>The tables have turned...</b>
<b>Whoa... that was a super shot.</b>
<b>Last ball and we need a sixer to win.</b>
<b>Last ball, runs required 6.</b>
<b>Step out and go for a cover shot.</b>
<b>Let's see if our friend Nagraj
can face this delivery.</b>
<b>Catch it man...</b>
<b>The Umpire has declared 'out'...</b>
<b>Hey...
I am not a player...</b>
<b>Looks like both the
players are out now!</b>
<b>That's a sixer.</b>
<b>Start the music...</b>
<b>-Yuva 11 has won this match.
-We won!</b>
<b>Bribed the umpire, my foot!</b>
<b>Amazing.</b>
<b>-Go to hell! -Congratulations Yuva 11
for winning this one.</b>
<b>Sir...

<b>[Cricket match on tv]</b>
<b>Don't move, or I'll kill you.</b>
<b>The bowler is not ready yet,</b>
<b>-I will be back before he bowls...
-Wait!</b>
<b>Sachin is about hit a century,
no one moves till then.</b>
<b>Sit down!</b>
<b>Century!</b>
<b>Century!</b>
<b>Oh God...</b>
<b>-It's a wrong shot.- He needed just one

<b>People pray and fast for the
victory of our country.</b>
<b>Couldn't you hold your pee?</b>
<b>Satya... I am sorry.</b>
<b>Hey Jonty...</b>
<b>You had a night shift today, didn't you?</b>
<b>I guess, you guys were planning to
enjoy the day & night match,</b>
<b>hence, I got my shift changed.</b>
<b>Thank you Satya, for these notes...</b>
<b>Hold on... wait dear...</b>
<b>I know my boy is a good for nothing,</b>

<b>Saraswathi...</b>

<b>You all are engineering students,</b>

<b>I want to be a cricketer... that's it.</b>
<b>I wanted to be the

<b>But I am only good at waving flags.</b>
<b>The train should always be on track,</b>

Do you understand?</b>
<b>Dad, have you heard the

<b>One day, you will hear it for me...</b>
<b>"Satya"</b>
<b>"Satya"</b>
<b>"Satya"</b>
<b>Please come soon, Satya...</b>
<b>Hey... go and find

<b>People are screaming,

<b>"Satya"</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>please see what's
wrong with electricity.</b>
<b>I should be in the limelight...</b>
<b>but here I am,
trying to fix a fused light.</b>
<b>Satya, I warn you...

<b>you will ruin it further...</b>
<b>I have called someone

<b>Your intelligence is quite evident...</b>
<b>... electronics, is it?</b>
<b>Don't act too smart,

<b>There is Nothing more

<b>You shut up!</b>
<b>Pass on the torch please.</b>
<b>Pass it on man...</b>
<b>Whoa...
He has restored the electricity.</b>
<b>Thank you dear...</b>
<b>What's the need to thank him?</b>
<b>Was that a big deal?</b>
<b>The kid is always helpful,</b>

<b>The selection for Railway
Cricket Team is on...</b>
<b>I want to see you in that team...</b>
<b>I have been playing for the 'B' team,
since last two years.</b>
<b>The coach has not seen my game yet.</b>
<b>I won't be selected... for sure.</b>
<b>Pick it up...</b>
<b>Keep it there.
Take these inside.</b>
<b>Wait...</b>
<b>Go get some marigold
flowers, be quick...</b>
<b>Hey... go walking.</b>
<b>Leave the bike here...</b>
<b>Your father is a miser...</b>
<b>Damn, we'll have to walk...</b>
<b>Run... Run...</b>
<b>For others, it's just a game.</b>
<b>But you guys will be doubly benefitted,
by selections and the railways placement.</b>
<b>Trials are about to begin,
so, gear up.</b>
<b>We need to up our game.</b>
<b>Yes sir...</b>
<b>The last season,
Aniket saved us from disgrace.</b>
<b>He is injured,
is there any replacement?</b>
<b>I think we should try Sarvesh...</b>
<b>Sarvesh, is a good choice.</b>
<b>-But I think...
-Sir...</b>
<b>I believe Aniket is injured,</b>
<b>give me a chance please.</b>
<b>Satya... you have a long way to go.</b>
<b>May be next year, okay?</b>
<b>Sir...
Please sir...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Sir may not know your caliber,</b>
<b>But I have seen you play...</b>
<b>Will you please put in a word for me?</b>
<b>10 grand...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I will do that, for 10 grand.</b>
<b>What? Is sport a business now?</b>
<b>It's all about money, honey...</b>
<b>Think about it.</b>
<b>What do you think?</b>
<b>Actually,
I intended to draw a Peacock...</b>
<b>This looks more like a Hippo...</b>
<b>You idiot...</b>
<b>I was talking about the 10 grand.</b>
<b>Do we have a choice?</b>
<b>We must pay him...</b>
<b>Or waste another full year, Satya...</b>
<b>My father will never agree...</b>
<b>Let's try my father then...</b>
<b>Look...</b>
<b>Hey, you sick idiot,</b>
<b>Can you please control yourself?</b>
<b>I have an idea...</b>
<b>Let's help my father in executing
this wedding event.</b>
<b>You work for him
and let's ask him to compensate.</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>How do you expect me to forget it?</b>
<b>Satya is just a kid...</b>
<b>Kid?</b>
<b>Satya?</b>
<b>Get him married now,
in a year you will be a grandfather.</b>
<b>So, what do you suggest?</b>
<b>Should I go and clean the wall?</b>
<b>No, why should you?</b>
<b>As is, you are raising an
irresponsible guy single handedly.</b>
<b>Murli...</b>
<b>I know he urinates on walls...</b>
<b>But he is not aware that I know it.</b>
<b>If he gets know, that I know,</b>
<b>I am sure, he is capable of urinating
on our house walls too.</b>
<b>Just a tip...</b>
<b>Don't let him know,
that you know about his activity.</b>
<b>Don't forget your
house has walls too...</b>
<b>Father is worse than his son.</b>
<b>It's better to die,
rather living such a sick life...</b>
<b>-So when is the date?
-What?</b>
<b>Hey... who's that,
talking nonsense?</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>your lighting prowess shouldn't
be any less than your batting skills.</b>
<b>I am sure, your silly father will fall in
love with me, seeing my lighting skills.</b>
<b>Your Nisha is such a sweetheart...</b>
<b>She was very helpful.</b>
<b>Yes, indeed...</b>
<b>I was worried,</b>
<b>if we will be bogged down
by the wedding arrangements.</b>
<b>Nisha, managed everything so well.</b>
<b>Of course...
Kaveri is her best friend.</b>
<b>I am so glad we got this opportunity
to host this ceremony at my place...</b>
<b>Where is Nisha?</b>
<b>Are you done?</b>
<b>Will you be taking me home?</b>
<b>Yes... No!</b>
<b>Let me go man...</b>
<b>Not a single cable should

<b>Is that set up ready?</b>
<b>How long man?</b>
<b>Hello...

<b>Do not forget, you are a cricketer.</b>
<b>Don't play hide and seek...</b>
<b>I just caught her...</b>
<b>I am a cricketer, you see...</b>
<b>Hey Nishu...</b>
<b>Please marry me...</b>
<b>Okay...</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Okay!</b>

<b>Okay!</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Will you please check if the

<b>Not for our wedding dear...</b>
<b>I meant, for this engagement today.</b>
<b>Hey Dug-Dug...</b>

<b>My Mom is missing...</b>
<b>It's you who is missing,

<b>Let's find your mom...</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Ah, there she is...

<b>Is that your mom?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Where is your dad?</b>
<b>He left us in the morning...</b>

<b>He went in the morning...</b>
<b>Now he is back...</b>
<b>Dad...</b>

<b>What a mess it is!</b>
<b>All set Amar?</b>
<b>any problems dude?</b>
<b>Dude?</b>
<b>Nisha...</b>
<b>You consider Kaveri

<b>Yes.</b>
<b>So, address your

<b>With respect?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Kaveri, rejected two guys,
before accepting your proposal...</b>
<b>and, I convinced her to accept you.</b>
<b>Here, you are showing your
true colors at the engagement.</b>
<b>She decides to watch a film,
only if she likes the trailer...</b>
<b>My mom is on stage...</b>
<b>she is busy with her photoshoot.</b>
<b>-Okay, I will convey...
-Hey, kiddo...</b>
<b>The girl on the stage,

<b>Yes...</b>
<b>And, the one over there,

<b>Nonsense, he may be your father...</b>
<b>My dad is on this table.</b>
<b>Hey fatso...</b>
<b>come over here...</b>
<b>The one on stage, is she your mom?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>And... is that your dad?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>And... he is your father...</b>
<b>-and, she's your mom?

<b>Hey, let's go...</b>
<b>It was already a triangle...</b>
<b>... but now a quadrangle?</b>
<b>What a mess it is!</b>
<b>I stole from my father's till,

<b>Still, we need to manage 2 more...</b>
<b>She is already managing 2...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Sick, the same tune playing at

<b>What?</b>
<b>The girl who is getting engaged today,

<b>What?</b>
<b>and has two kids...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>And her kids and two husbands

<b>What about our lunch?</b>
<b>Run!</b>
<b>Stop it!</b>
<b>Amar, who told you

<b>And about her two kids?</b>
<b>This guy...</b>
<b>This lady.</b>
<b>This guy...</b>
<b>She.</b>
<b>I heard the light men gossiping.</b>
<b>He said, Kaveri is twice married,
and has two kids.</b>
<b>You are 2 grand short!</b>
<b>Please adjust this time...</b>
<b>This is not a rikshaw (public transport)
to adjust and accommodate!</b>
<b>You won't regret man,
Satya is like a rocket.</b>
<b>Just adjust this one time...</b>
<b>Okay, you will be the 9th player.</b>
<b>Okay, done...</b>
<b>Nonsense...</b>
<b>I am an opening batsman...</b>
<b>9th man is better
than the 12th man.</b>
<b>Great...</b>
<b>Great...</b>
<b>Well-done... Good show...
What an amazing century, Kunal.</b>
<b>How can you be so irresponsible, Vijay?</b>
<b>Mohan...</b>
<b>I told you to keep at good length.</b>
<b>Our bowling line-up was pathetic.</b>
<b>I hope you guys will not let me down
with your batting line up.</b>
<b>And please stick to the game plan...</b>
<b>Come on, come on boys...</b>
<b>We can do it...
Go, get up...</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Fine leg and square leg
both are inside the circle...</b>
<b>He should just step out of
off stump and hit a sweep shot.</b>
<b>Well done boys.</b>
<b>Hard luck...</b>
<b>You should've gone for a sweep shot...</b>
<b>Extra cover is within the circle...</b>
<b>He should just step out and
go for an inside out shot.</b>
<b>Oh God!</b>
<b>Well bowled...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>-Pad up!
-Me?</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>Come on... Come on...

<b>Get some water...</b>
<b>Satya,</b>
<b>are you alright?</b>
<b>Get some water... Hurry up.</b>
<b>Call it retired hurt.</b>
<b>Come on boys...</b>
<b>It was so embarrassing...

<b>Nisha...</b>
<b>Where have you been?</b>
<b>Do you even know what
we went through?</b>
<b>What's wrong now?</b>
<b>The light technician, came and
cleared all our confusion.</b>
<b>We blamed him for no reason.</b>
<b>True...</b>
<b>The confusion was created by
these tiny tots...</b>
<b>Hence, he was confused...</b>
<b>Don't blame us...</b>
<b>I pointed at my mom...</b>
<b>He was a fool to look at
aunt Kaveri and conclude.</b>
<b>I am sorry...</b>
<b>It's okay.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Your planning was flawless...</b>
<b>Kunal was hinting at something.</b>
<b>Not now dad...</b>
<b>Okay...
He is waiting for you...</b>
<b>Do meet him once...
Okay?</b>
<b>Come on cheer up now...</b>
<b>Looks like someone
pelted stones at you.</b>
<b>Are you such a lousy player?</b>
<b>I smashed all deliveries
of a bowler,</b>
<b>and he did this to me
out of frustration.</b>
<b>-Did you see a doctor?
-Of course I did...</b>
<b>He said, to recover quickly,</b>
<b>I should have Jilebis (Indian sweets),
twice a day.</b>
<b>Are you sure he was a doctor
and not a sweetmeat owner?</b>
<b>It's enriched with vitamin B...</b>
<b>'Ji... Le...'</b>
<b>'B...'</b>
<b>Oh!</b>
<b>'Ji... le... bi'?</b>
<b>Are you trying to fool your father?</b>
<b>Just a minute...</b>
<b>Don't act smart!</b>
<b>here,</b>
<b>This is as good as... nothing.</b>
<b>Ji,</b>
<b>le,</b>
<b>bi...</b>
<b>Silly sweet tooth!</b>
<b>You freaking car...</b>
<b>Kunal...

<b>I want to talk to him.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Step out please.</b>
<b>Hi!</b>
<b>I am Nisha...</b>
<b>Please get inside,

<b>Excuse me...</b>

<b>Now I know the facts...</b>
<b>I lost my job... what about that?</b>
<b>How should I support

<b>Tell me?</b>
<b>My drunkard uncle who abuses me daily,

<b>I was not paid for the work done.</b>
<b>Err... let me...</b>
<b>I was kidding dear...</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>Okay, I will see you

<b>This is Mr. Bankar...</b>
<b>He is an umpire at the upcoming

<b>-He is a teacher.
-Please sit...</b>
<b>we had to interrupt

<b>You idiots...</b>
<b>you should've let him

<b>Education and such honest teachers

<b>But he is not willing to

<b>Collaboration means fixing.</b>
<b>And fixing is unethical.</b>
<b>No means no...</b>
<b>Okay...</b>
<b>Let him go...</b>
<b>Drop him

<b>Your kid must be waiting for you.</b>
<b>I have told you guys several times,</b>

<b>What if right outside his school,</b>
<b>... his kid gets

<b>Okay, you may leave.</b>
<b>I am willing...</b>
<b>to co-operate...</b>
<b>Please come again?</b>
<b>I am willing to co-operate...</b>
<b>That's the right word...</b>
<b>I have been trying hard

<b>Now, I know...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Get out in this over.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I want you to get out...</b>
<b>I don't cheat.</b>

<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Idiots...

<b>And you... Satya...</b>
<b>You played like an ass...</b>
<b>Sir, I got run out, because of him.</b>
<b>-What do you mean?
-Yes, I did...</b>
<b>That's because, he fixed this match.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>And he offered to buy me out...</b>
<b>Sir, this guy is a cheat.</b>
<b>-He offered me money.
-He is lying.</b>
<b>-Stop it.
-Sir, he is a liar...</b>
<b>Stop it!</b>
<b>Satya, I said, stop it.</b>
<b>There is no place for

<b>And I trust him.</b>
<b>You are not a part of

<b>Sir,</b>
<b>-he is a cheater.

<b>Leave!</b>
<b>How is that possible?

<b>I tried,</b>
<b>but my coach was

<b>In fact he was screaming at me.</b>
<b>Forget it...</b>
<b>From tomorrow,

<b>What? Football?</b>
<b>Cricket is my life...</b>
<b>Cricket is my life...

<b>... To be so rigid

<b>I wanted a particular dress
for the wedding, I didn't' get it...</b>
<b>so, should I avoid
attending the wedding?</b>
<b>How's this?</b>
<b>Ganya...</b>
<b>Yes, Anna...</b>
<b>Who is she?</b>
<b>I don't know her...</b>
<b>but the guy with her is... Satya...</b>
<b>Who, Satya?</b>
<b>We would've lost our last
match because of him.</b>
<b>Glad we collaborated
with the captain.</b>
<b>Why should a captain,
or a coach decide your fate?</b>
<b>You are the captain of your life.</b>
<b>Only you have the
right to control your life.</b>
<b>Never let anyone control your life.</b>
<b>Yesterday, I bought a vest from you,</b>
<b>only to discover this...
camisole after reaching home.</b>
<b>Please explain.
Do you expect me to wear this?</b>
<b>-My wife was very livid.
-Sorry, sir.</b>
<b>I suggest you shut
your shop now...</b>
<b>come with me and
apologize to my wife.</b>
<b>You need to tighten
your reins...</b>
<b>Your son is flirting around
with his girlfriend.</b>
<b>Murli...</b>
<b>I know he may have a girlfriend.</b>
<b>He doesn't know that I know,</b>
<b>If he comes to know that, I know,</b>
<b>then he will ask me
to get him married to her...</b>
<b>And that will be the end of his
cricketing career...</b>
<b>He can't be playing cricket
inside our house...</b>
<b>What if he has to face a no-ball?</b>
<b>He is such a sick father...</b>
<b>It's better to die, rather
living such a wasted life like his.</b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>Sir, I want to apologize for...</b>
<b>Satya, I don't want to talk to you.</b>
<b>Sir, please hear me out.</b>
<b>Don't you understand?</b>
<b>I am not interested in
talking to fixers.</b>
<b>Do come see us play...</b>
<b>It's your fate to be an audience.</b>
<b>Good morning, guys...</b>
<b>Ganya...</b>
<b>I can tolerate everything...</b>
<b>but injustice...</b>
<b>I see vast skies...</b>
<b>and he has powerful wings...</b>
<b>but he is banned from flying.</b>
<b>Such a sad state...</b>
<b>hey 'Angry Bird'...</b>
<b>Spit this fire on
the pitch, not on me.</b>
<b>Do you understand?</b>
<b>If you want to prove them wrong,
then play for my team.</b>
<b>Give it a try...</b>
<b>Take it...</b>
<b>I will open this match...</b>
<b>Yes, you open this match...</b>
<b>and I will close this chapter.</b>
<b>I smashed a century...
and won the match.</b>
<b>Fantastic... finally
you convinced your coach!</b>
<b>I played for the opposite team.</b>
<b>Playing is important.</b>
<b>The wedding is at night...
Don't be late.</b>
<b>In life, if you don't get what
you want, then what's the point?</b>
<b>What did you get?</b>
<b>What did you get...
... by selling off my father's bike?</b>
<b>You can sell off my father's scooter.</b>
<b>Okay...</b>
<b>Did you guys find my bike?</b>
<b>-No!
-No!</b>
<b>I am unable to find
it since afternoon.</b>
<b>Actually, since morning.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I couldn't find your bike
since morning...</b>
<b>and he couldn't too...</b>
<b>what?</b>
<b>Our bike...</b>
<b>Who?</b>
<b>Find the bike.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Come, let's search...</b>
<b>find out who conned you...</b>
<b>what?</b>
<b>I mean, let's find if someone
stole it from you.</b>
<b>The shop was shut...</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>It's still shut...</b>
<b>Have you always
been a perfectionist?</b>
<b>Yes, at least during
such special moments.</b>
<b>Wedding is not just another event.</b>
<b>It's the most important
moment of our life.</b>
<b>That moment is like...</b>
<b>the delicately folded corner
of a page in the book of our life.</b>
<b>We may have finished
reading the entire book,</b>
<b>yet we can always come back
to the bookmarked page.</b>
<b>As we frequently, love to experience
this special moment of our life.</b>
<b>That's why one should strive hard
to make this extra special.</b>
<b>We all have our special
moments in life.</b>
<b>What about you?</b>
<b>This moment...</b>
<b>is that bookmarked page in my life.</b>
<b>Wow...</b>
<b>this is beautiful.</b>
<b>You did this for me?</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>I like you.</b>
<b>And what if I don't like you?</b>
<b>I will still keep liking you...</b>
<b>all my life...</b>
<b>Do you love me so much?</b>
<b>What I feel for you, is not love...</b>
<b>it's madness.</b>
<b>I want to make love to you.</b>
<b>"After meeting you, I felt as if... "</b>
<b>"... the desires of my heart
have been fulfilled."</b>
<b>"O my faithful beloved... "</b>
<b>"together we both are one life."</b>
<b>"We'll always be together... "</b>
<b>"I won't separate from you."</b>
<b>Hey, damn it...</b>
<b>-Who the hell is this guy?
-Sit...</b>
<b>Hey carryon...</b>
<b>He is our Satya...</b>
<b>Brother... looks like
you are day dreaming...</b>
<b>Come join us...</b>
<b>I am a bit busy brother.</b>
<b>Busy?</b>
<b>I know you have been quite busy...</b>
<b>at the beach...
at shopping...</b>
<b>sometimes at the bus stop.</b>
<b>Lovebirds...</b>
<b>Good, keep going...</b>
<b>And why do you guys
meet at public places?</b>
<b>Take her to some private place...</b>
<b>Now I know what
your problem is...</b>
<b>Here, the keys to our party office.</b>
<b>The office will remain
shut for two days...</b>
<b>Thank you...</b>
<b>You are like my brother.</b>
<b>Satya, remember,
always safety first.</b>
<b>Excuse me...</b>
<b>What do you want?</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>I mean...</b>
<b>An umbrella?</b>
<b>Umbrella, here?</b>
<b>I mean... a cap...</b>
<b>Umbrella, I meant a cap?</b>
<b>Seat cover?</b>
<b>Umbrella, cap, seat cover?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Helmet?</b>
<b>Speak up man...
what do you want?</b>
<b>Condom...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Condom?</b>
<b>What are you embarrassed about?</b>
<b>Flavor?</b>
<b>Do me one favor...</b>
<b>give any flavor...</b>
<b>Give him a condom...</b>
<b>Here...</b>
<b>-What's this?
-Condom!</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Should I have it with water?</b>
<b>I wanted a strip of Crocin.</b>
<b>I want medication for headache,
and you want me to suffocate and die?</b>
<b>Condom is not for this gentleman...</b>
<b>-It's for him over there...
-Sorry sir.</b>
<b>-Enjoy!
-Thanks...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>So, is this your new activity?
Is your father aware of this?</b>
<b>I will convey this to your father.</b>
<b>But no point talking to his father...</b>
<b>It's better to die,
rather having a son like him.</b>
<b>"My heart is so restless,"</b>
<b>"I can't live a moment
without you."</b>
<b>"Let's just melt into each other,"</b>
<b>"embrace me oh dear."</b>
<b>"This unexpected fire in me,"</b>
<b>"makes me so anxious."</b>
<b>"I have wasted my body and soul,"</b>
<b>"just for you, my dear."</b>
<b>"Madness for you,

<b>"Madness for you, makes me

<b>Brother!</b>
<b>-Ganya?
-Is everything okay?</b>
<b>Yes, okay...</b>
<b>Anna is reaching.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>Nisha, come,
let's go...</b>
<b>You leave...</b>
<b>-Let her wait here.
-What?</b>
<b>Just for an hour...</b>
<b>What nonsense are you talking?</b>
<b>Anna liked her...</b>
<b>This is the first time Anna has
asked me for something.</b>
<b>Ganya!</b>
<b>Hey, move aside...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Nisha!</b>
<b>Anna...</b>
<b>Please let her go...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Please don't harm her Anna...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Anna... Please leave her...
Let her go.</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>-Anna, I beg of you... Please let her go.
-Hey, take him away...</b>
<b>Ganya,</b>
<b>you called me brother, didn't you?</b>
<b>Please ask Anna to stop this...</b>
<b>Get out...</b>
<b>Hey catch him...</b>
<b>Don't dare to touch me. Move!</b>
<b>Let's go Nisha...</b>
<b>Move away...</b>
<b>Anna... are you okay?</b>
<b>Are you hurt Anna?</b>
<b>Go get him now...</b>
<b>Let's go...</b>
<b>Hey, is this the time
to come home?</b>
<b>Just tell them I am not around...</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>I will explain...</b>
<b>Namaskar... Sir...</b>
<b>Namaskar!</b>
<b>Satya, is he home?</b>
<b>He is not around.</b>
<b>He was with you, right?</b>
<b>Yes... correct...
Please call me, once he is back...</b>
<b>-Okay...
-Let's go...</b>
<b>What's all this?</b>
<b>Bhaskar Anna's men were chasing her,</b>
<b>so, I got her with me.</b>
<b>Who is she?</b>
<b>What mom meant to you,
she means to me.</b>
<b>Go, drop her home...</b>
<b>Did you get my point?</b>
<b>Her friend circle is not good.</b>
<b>You have no clue about her.</b>
<b>The boys in this locality,
are all louts.</b>
<b>They will try to get close to her
in the guise of helping her...</b>
<b>then they will take
undue advantage,</b>
<b>and your daughter will get pregnant.
You know what I mean...</b>
<b>Here, purse...</b>
<b>I found this in my office.</b>
<b>I know you are quite broad minded.</b>
<b>Not everyone is like you...</b>
<b>In this town, such humiliating news
gets broadcasted in a jiffy.</b>
<b>Nisha is like my sister...</b>
<b>Hence, here I am, to alert you.</b>
<b>Let me know,
if you need any help.</b>
<b>And sir...</b>
<b>please don't reprimand Nisha...</b>
<b>She is quite soft hearted...</b>
<b>Take care...</b>
<b>Okay, I'll take your leave.</b>
<b>Sister.</b>
<b>Dad...</b>
<b>Dad...</b>
<b>You are misusing your freedom...</b>
<b>-Dad, that Bhaskar...
-Just shut up!</b>
<b>-Papa, I...
-Not a word...</b>
<b>You are grounded...</b>
<b>Dad, listen to me please...</b>
<b>Dad!</b>
<b>Hey... get out of here...</b>
<b>What are you staring at?
Get out man!</b>
<b>Sir, Please hear me out...</b>
<b>Sir...</b>
<b>Nisha!</b>
<b>I caught the captain red-handed,
fixing a match.</b>
<b>I realized you were innocent.</b>
<b>I am sorry!</b>
<b>The day after tomorrow, we have
the final 'Railway team' selection.</b>
<b>I have recommended your name,</b>
<b>so, don't miss it.</b>
<b>Satya,</b>
<b>do you realize
how important this is?</b>
<b>Sir, I will get him...</b>
<b>I assure you.</b>
<b>Great...</b>
<b>I will see you on field.</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Sir, please listen to me...</b>
<b>I said just go...</b>
<b>Nisha...</b>
<b>-Get lost from here...
-Nisha!</b>
<b>Leave me...</b>
<b>Satya's hanging around,
outside my house,</b>
<b>is quite embarrassing.</b>
<b>Threaten him if needed,
and move him out.</b>
<b>Don't be too harsh...</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>Captain says, just threaten
and let him off.</b>
<b>I suggest, finish him off.</b>
<b>Satya... Quick, get inside the car.</b>
<b>Catch him, don't let him go...</b>
<b>Be quick...</b>
<b>Nisha...</b>
<b>May I know,
what are you up to?</b>
<b>Bhaskar's men were
out there to kill you.</b>
<b>Bhaskar is responsible for
my father's misunderstanding...</b>
<b>I need to clear it all...
Please stay inside...</b>
<b>I want to meet
your father too.</b>
<b>What if you are attacked by
Bhaskar's men, if you step out?</b>
<b>Listen to me please,</b>
<b>just stay indoors, until tomorrow.</b>
<b>I have my cricket
selection in the evening.</b>
<b>Selectors will be there for that.</b>
<b>Satya, what's more important
to you, cricket or me?</b>
<b>Both are equally important.</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Listen, let's clear this air,
once for all, after that,</b>
<b>I promise you...</b>
<b>we will always be together.</b>
<b>Take care.</b>
<b>Don't leave.</b>
<b>Wait for me.</b>
<b>What if you are attacked by
Bhaskar's men, if you step out?</b>
<b>Satya, what's more important
to you, Cricket or me?</b>
<b>Please wait inside...</b>
<b>I promise you...
we will always be together.</b>
<b>Wait for me...</b>
<b>Brother...</b>
<b>Bhaskar's men are troubling
your wife...</b>
<b>Hey! Move back.</b>
<b>Get lost.</b>
<b>Anna...</b>
<b>Anna...</b>
<b>Hey... what's your name?</b>
<b>I asked, what's your name?</b>
<b>His name is 'Satya'.</b>
<b>I am his father.</b>
<b>Sonavane Sir,</b>
<b>see how badly he has trashed him...
Show him the wounds.</b>
<b>What nonsense is this?</b>
<b>But as per their complaint,
your men triggered the fight.</b>
<b>These boys?</b>
<b>Sir, how is that possible?</b>
<b>They are all social activists.</b>
<b>Why would they do such hooliganism?</b>
<b>They are all innocents...</b>
<b>Sir, you have mistaken...</b>
<b>What do you mean?</b>
<b>Sir, this Angry Bird here,
is quite hot tempered...</b>
<b>He has not forgotten
his girlfriend...</b>
<b>He boozes and troubles people
for his miseries...</b>
<b>Did you get my point?</b>
<b>So did your men misbehave
with his girlfriend?</b>
<b>No, sir, she is not his girlfriend.
She is his wife...</b>
<b>My daughter-in-law.</b>
<b>She is the victim, right?
Bring her here...</b>
<b>Let's hear her version.</b>
<b>Your name?</b>
<b>Shravani.</b>
<b>Is he yout husband?</b>
<b>Did they misbehave with you?</b>
<b>Sawant Ma'am...</b>
<b>Please record her statement.</b>
<b>Sir, they have filed a
cross complaint too...</b>
<b>So, your son too will be
detained here tonight.</b>
<b>if this is going to
inconvenience my husband.</b>
<b>then, I don't want to
lodge a complaint,</b>
<b>May I... ?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Why?</b>
<b>Not needed...</b>
<b>Who is not needed?</b>
<b>Your wife?</b>
<b>or your father?</b>
<b>Can I get some tea for you?</b>
<b>There she goes again...</b>
<b>I knew, you will change the topic.</b>
<b>Why do you always try to protect him?</b>
<b>You have been married for so long...</b>
<b>Did you even bother
to speak sweetly to her?</b>
<b>... or took her out somewhere?</b>
<b>Do you wish to go somewhere?</b>
<b>Just send me away once and for all.</b>
<b>He always asks me out...</b>
<b>I have been declining all the time.</b>
<b>Look dear,</b>
<b>please don't think,
I am not aware of the reality.</b>
<b>-Shravani...
-There he is...</b>
<b>Welcome...</b>
<b>Here,</b>
<b>some fresh mango pulp for you...</b>
<b>This is just for you.</b>
<b>Okay, give some to your father-in-law.</b>
<b>Okay, give a spoonful
to your husband too.</b>
<b>Okay, give it all
to your dear husband,</b>
<b>pour it on his head, for all I care.</b>
<b>Please sit, Murli...</b>
<b>We avoid even having water
at our daughter's in-law's place...</b>
<b>How about some tea?</b>
<b>Sure, only if it's made without water.</b>
<b>Don't you understand?</b>
<b>I asked you to deliver
this file to our Head Office.</b>
<b>Why is it still lying here?</b>
<b>Come over here...</b>
<b>It's been a month, these papers
are just lying around.</b>
<b>I want them organized right now.</b>
<b>She is always tongue
tied in front of her husband,</b>
<b>But throws her weight
around in the office.</b>
<b>I don't know what her problem is?</b>
<b>I don't like to gossip at work!</b>
<b>That's my problem...</b>
<b>Now, do you know what your problem is?</b>
<b>The sari your husband gifted you,</b>
<b>was bought at 'Buy one
and get two free' offer.</b>
<b>Do you know where
the other two saris are?</b>
<b>Everyone in this office
is well aware of it...</b>
<b>except you...</b>
<b>This is your problem...</b>
<b>She always speaks nonsense.</b>
<b>Pooja Ma'am, this file is...</b>
<b>Good morning, sir...</b>
<b>Looks like you all
shopped at the same shop...</b>
<b>That's such an
amazing camaraderie...</b>
<b>Great...</b>
<b>Shravani... meet me

<b>Please come dear,</b>
<b>-Please sit down...
-Good morning, sir...</b>
<b>I know you were unwell,</b>
<b>I have drafted all your letters,</b>
<b>please do check them...</b>
<b>I wasn't unwell...</b>
<b>-What?

<b>What?</b>
<b>I was out on a trip...</b>
<b>-A trip?

<b>My wife loves ocean.</b>
<b>So, I went with her to Goa...</b>
<b>on our second honeymoon...</b>
<b>-Second honeymoon?
-Keep it low...</b>
<b>Don't scream and

<b>Obviously not sir...</b>
<b>So...</b>
<b>Where did you go

<b>We?</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>-Actually...
-What?</b>
<b>Ours was a destination wedding.</b>
<b>-Is it?
-Yes.</b>
<b>A destination wedding?</b>
<b>So we extended
our stay over there.</b>
<b>Unbelievable...</b>
<b>that's so nice to

<b>Where was this destination?</b>
<b>My husband is fond of ice...</b>
<b>-Ice?
-Yes...</b>
<b>So we went to Manali...</b>
<b>Manali?</b>
<b>Manali!</b>
<b>Such a nice place...</b>
<b>Whoa!</b>
<b>It's been so many years,</b>
<b>you never introduced

<b>Do get him over sometime...</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>Ma'am...</b>
<b>Your husband is here...</b>
<b>This is pure coincidence...</b>

<b>I am sure he is busy...</b>
<b>This is pure love...</b>
<b>How come you are here?</b>
<b>Yes... I am here...</b>
<b>Actually, I was over there...</b>
<b>I saw this board,
and now I am over here.</b>
<b>So, this is our station.</b>
<b>No, it belongs to the government...</b>
<b>That's what I meant...
The government is also ours.</b>
<b>I mean, it was, sometime back.</b>
<b>Okay, I will take your leave then...</b>
<b>Did you call me over?</b>
<b>No...</b>
<b>-No?
-No...</b>
<b>Sorry...</b>
<b>Yesterday, while washing your clothes,</b>
<b>I found this in your shirt pocket.</b>
<b>You sure?
This is mine?</b>
<b>Are you sure?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>I supported the Kings

<b>he quit to join the Sunrisers...</b>
<b>When I started to cheer for Sunrisers,</b>
<b>He jumped over to the Pune team...</b>
<b>When I sported the Pune team's

<b>The team vanished...</b>
<b>I am glad I didn't wear

<b>Hello...</b>
<b>Yes sir...</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Okay...</b>
<b>Sure, I will talk to him...</b>
<b>Coach was on phone with me...</b>

<b>Whether I am drinking to

<b>or to forget her...</b>
<b>I have no clue.</b>
<b>Is it that difficult to open

<b>I am not interested

<b>ask him,</b>

<b>Tell your dear husband...</b>

<b>You ruined your father's life...</b>
<b>now you are out to

<b>You good for nothing, drunkard...</b>
<b>Aren't you ashamed living

<b>Do you want him to
die with your worries?</b>
<b>Instead of doing ten things to
appease his soul after his death...</b>
<b>... while he is alive,
just do one thing...</b>
<b>... accept Shravani's proposal.</b>
<b>"After meeting you,"</b>
<b>"I felt as if... "</b>
<b>"... the desires of
my heart has been fulfilled."</b>
<b>"O my faithful beloved."</b>
<b>"Together we both are one life."</b>
<b>Hello, uncle Akbar...</b>
<b>I am good...
How have you been?</b>
<b>How's your Salim?</b>
<b>What, is he worried?</b>
<b>That's obvious...</b>
<b>You are such an irresponsible
father, Akbya...</b>
<b>Aren't you worried
about his future?</b>
<b>Listen to me...</b>
<b>Don't entomb him alive...</b>
<b>He is capable of
boozing there as well.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>From where does he get
money for alcohol?</b>
<b>Your daughter-in-law... silly!</b>
<b>He lives off her earnings.</b>
<b>Aunty Jodha!</b>
<b>How have you been?</b>
<b>What, you went to the
village, all alone?</b>
<b>Uncle Akbar misses you a lot.</b>
<b>And he takes out his
frustrations on poor Salim.</b>
<b>Aunty Jodha...
can I tell you something?</b>
<b>What if,</b>
<b>your husband Akbar,
listens to Anu?</b>
<b>Yes, Anu is Anarkali,</b>
<b>his daughter-in-law.</b>
<b>What if he starts listening to her?</b>
<b>He will feel less troubled.</b>
<b>Sallu and Anu
will manage their lives</b>
<b>Why should he interfere
in their personal matters?</b>
<b>Stop it I say...
Hang up the phone.</b>
<b>Hey Satya...</b>
<b>Here, take this one...</b>
<b>this shirt is properly ironed.</b>
<b>Whoa...</b>
<b>Sister Jodha...</b>
<b>Err... I mean, Saraswati...</b>
<b>I feel restrained because
of my promise to you..</b>
<b>else, I would've smashed
your son to pulp by now.</b>
<b>Dad...</b>
<b>-Dad...
-Yes?</b>
<b>Dad,</b>
<b>I do understand what
you are going through.</b>
<b>I feel...</b>
<b>we should try to understand
his feelings too.</b>
<b>We've been doing that all along.</b>
<b>And for how long should
we put up with him?</b>
<b>Will he ever change?
is there any guarantee?</b>
<b>Guarantees are meant for appliances,</b>
<b>not for relationships...</b>
<b>I am connected to him as well.</b>
<b>I love him too...</b>
<b>You are his father...</b>
<b>Your love also has ownership.</b>
<b>How do you
tolerate his behavior?</b>
<b>Dad,</b>
<b>you feel his drinking should lessen.</b>
<b>I feel his troubles should lessen.</b>
<b>It's as simple as that...</b>
<b>Your goodness is
beyond my imagination.</b>
<b>I taught him to walk,</b>
<b>and today he loses his
balance because of alcohol.</b>
<b>and helplessly we just have
to watch him fall.</b>
<b>A father's expectations are shattered,</b>
<b>you won't understand
my pain, Shravani.</b>
<b>At least love is the reason
for your angst for each other.</b>
<b>I get nothing from him,</b>
<b>neither love nor anger.</b>
<b>You will never understand
the pain of loving someone.</b>
<b>Who never loved you back.</b>
<b>Boys...</b>
<b>never underestimate
the power of liquor.</b>
<b>It understands, if you are drinking
to celebrate,</b>
<b>or boozing to lessen your pain.</b>
<b>It understands our emotions.</b>
<b>Bhaskar Anna...</b>
<b>He has not uttered a word against you.</b>
<b>Neither did I complain...</b>
<b>But Jonty, my anger is...</b>
<b>... justified.</b>
<b>Our country lost a great player,</b>
<b>I was very hopeful to see him...</b>
<b>... play for our national team.</b>
<b>Now look at him...</b>
<b>always hanging around at cheap bars.</b>
<b>Jonty,</b>
<b>stop living at wife's expense man...</b>
<b>Angry bird...</b>
<b>put their drinks on my tab.</b>
<b>Call up our coach.</b>
<b>Why do you have to shine
his bike, everyday?</b>
<b>Does even bother to use it?</b>
<b>He will...</b>
<b>You should've given him cash instead,</b>
<b>at least he would've used it
more effectively.</b>
<b>Don't worry, I will use it...</b>
<b>Of course... Not!</b>
<b>This belongs to him.</b>
<b>Whoa...</b>
<b>So please... tell your dear husband...</b>
<b>to keep his hands off my scooter.</b>
<b>along with liquor...</b>
<b>He guzzles down my fuel too...</b>
<b>Gosh! she is angry...</b>
<b>I am glad I was at a safe distance,</b>
<b>I saved myself from her wrath.</b>
<b>My foot!</b>
<b>You think he'll moving out?</b>
<b>Satya?</b>
<b>You fool...</b>
<b>What's up?</b>
<b>Don't you have any manners?</b>
<b>Are you off to sell some
household items for your alcohol?</b>
<b>We are off to New Delhi.</b>
<b>Ah, I am so glad to
see you accompany him...</b>
<b>What's the purpose?</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>He has been appointed
as a coach for the under 14 team.</b>
<b>And finally, he has
accepted the offer.</b>
<b>Coaching?</b>
<b>Wait a minute...</b>
<b>Couldn't you open your
mouth and speak?</b>
<b>I suggest,</b>
<b>you take your wife along.</b>
<b>I am going on an assignment,</b>
<b>not for picnic.</b>
<b>-You...
-Hold on...</b>
<b>Also, I won't get any leaves
at such a short notice.</b>
<b>-But...
-Hold this please...</b>
<b>Hey...</b>
<b>What's going on?</b>
<b>Good luck!</b>
<b>Job!</b>
<b>Delhi!</b>
<b>Coaching!</b>
<b>Thank God, he finally landed a job.</b>
<b>Are you crazy?</b>
<b>I am sure, liquor must
be cheap over there</b>
<b>he must've gone to buy some booze.</b>
<b>Welcome to the academy, Satya...</b>
<b>I am so glad, finally,
you accepted my offer.</b>
<b>Thank you sir.</b>
<b>See, coaching has a great future.</b>
<b>And I know your caliber.</b>
<b>You could've been a great player.</b>
<b>But now you have an opportunity
to create a great player. Right?</b>
<b>Sir, thank you so much for
remembering him, for this position.</b>
<b>Hey watch...</b>
<b>Good, now rotate the batsman...</b>
<b>Khushi, you are next...</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>Oh my God.
Maharashtra's girl in Delhi?</b>
<b>Next.</b>
<b>Good...</b>
<b>Now show me forward defence.</b>
<b>Next...</b>
<b>Good shot!</b>
<b>Show me forward defence!</b>
<b>Lean front and play, okay?</b>
<b>Forward defence!</b>
<b>Don't you understand?</b>
<b>Can't you hear what I say?</b>
<b>I will defend if the
ball is worth defending...</b>
<b>Pull up you bowler first... not me.</b>
<b>Come on, deliver the next...</b>
<b>Out... Step out...</b>
<b>You are benched!</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>You can't play the next match.</b>
<b>Satya, she is a good player.</b>
<b>I know sir...</b>
<b>We need to control her aggression.</b>
<b>Such directionless
aggression is pointless.</b>
<b>Coach...</b>
<b>Hello, Mr. Kumar.</b>
<b>Did you bench my granddaughter?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>She is the best player in the team.</b>
<b>So why is she not playing?</b>
<b>She is a fabulous player...</b>
<b>But she is too aggressive,
and that's her problem.</b>
<b>It's our new coach's decision,
to bench her, at least for one match.</b>
<b>It'll be good for her.</b>
<b>Who is the new coach?</b>
<b>Coach!</b>
<b>What did you achieve
by separating us?</b>
<b>Why did you ruin our lives?</b>
<b>You have no clue what I went through.</b>
<b>Nisha abandoned me 12 years ago,</b>
<b>and I am still waiting for
her where she left me.</b>
<b>I don't know why?</b>
<b>But I know for a fact that,</b>
<b>Nisha can never be
happy without me.</b>
<b>She should be alive, to be happy.</b>
<b>That night, we left everything behind,
and moved to Delhi.</b>
<b>Nisha could never
get you out of her mind.</b>
<b>Later, I faked some documents,</b>
<b>to prove to her that
Bhaskar had killed you.</b>
<b>A few years later,</b>
<b>I married her off to Kunal.</b>
<b>Since then,
she stopped talking to me.</b>
<b>Years later,
she gave birth to a baby girl.</b>
<b>And then started living
for her daughter.</b>
<b>But God had different plans for her.</b>
<b>A few years ago...</b>
<b>Nisha and Kunal
met with an accident...</b>
<b>And we lost both of them.</b>
<b>This morning,</b>
<b>the girl you reprimanded,</b>
<b>Khushi,</b>
<b>she is Nisha's daughter.</b>
<b>Cricket is...</b>
<b>Khushi's life...</b>
<b>It was Nisha's dream...</b>
<b>to see Khushi as a cricketer.</b>
<b>I never got an opportunity
to apologize to Nisha.</b>
<b>But here, I apologize to you...</b>
<b>I am sorry.</b>
<b>Mr. Kumar,
I feel it's the right decision,</b>
<b>to move Khushi out of
her comfort zone.</b>
<b>She needs isolated training.</b>
<b>We are running out of time.</b>
<b>We hardly have a month, to prepare
her for the Delhi under 14 tournament.</b>
<b>Think about it.</b>
<b>If Satya agrees to this,</b>
<b>you have my consent too.</b>
<b>Kumar,</b>
<b>how could you do this to me?</b>
<b>I called you here,
to set this cranky guy straight,</b>
<b>how dare you send me with
him for personal coaching?</b>
<b>You trust me, right?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Bye!</b>
<b>Thank you for this.</b>
<b>Hey...</b>
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>
<b>What do you want?</b>
<b>One clean room...</b>
<b>Hey, where are you going?</b>
<b>Who is she?</b>
<b>Which one is my room...</b>
<b>You take the corner room...</b>
<b>I don't share my
room with strangers.</b>
<b>I don't even share the room
with the person I am supposed to.</b>
<b>Why is she going inside?</b>
<b>Who is she?
Can't you introduce her?</b>
<b>He doesn't care to speak up...</b>
<b>Saraswati...
what the hell is going on?</b>
<b>Are you going to open your mouth?</b>
<b>She is Khushi...</b>
<b>Nisha's daughter.</b>
<b>Nisha's daughter?</b>
<b>Nisha?</b>
<b>You mean, your ex?</b>
<b>Have you lost your mind?</b>
<b>Why did you bring her daughter here?</b>
<b>Forget me...</b>
<b>You should've thought
about your wife at least.</b>
<b>What's there for dinner today?</b>
<b>Oh God...</b>
<b>This is so unhealthy...</b>
<b>Okra fry, 225 Cal,</b>
<b>Potato, cumin seeds, 125 Cal.</b>
<b>Royal Cottage Cheese, 375 Calories...</b>
<b>I want to be a cricketer,</b>
<b>not a weight lifter...</b>
<b>Hey,</b>
<b>have you informed your parents
about your visit here?</b>
<b>-Dinkar!
-Hey!</b>
<b>-Chill,
-What do you mean?</b>
<b>-Chill...
-Okay...</b>
<b>My parents are gone...</b>
<b>Where?</b>
<b>To meet your wife, Saraswati.</b>
<b>I can't eat this...</b>
<b>I need to call Kumar.</b>
<b>Should I cook something
of your choice?</b>
<b>No!</b>
<b>Okay!</b>
<b>How's it?</b>
<b>Too good...</b>
<b>But this is quite high on calories.</b>
<b>Do you have some extra?</b>
<b>I have an extra spoon.</b>
<b>That's fine.</b>
<b>Is my coach, your husband?</b>
<b>I feel sad for you.</b>
<b>Give him some time,</b>
<b>I am sure you will realize,</b>
<b>how lucky you are,
to get such a coach.</b>
<b>For how many years
have you been married?</b>
<b>Seven.</b>
<b>In which year did you realize,</b>
<b>you are lucky,
to get a husband like him?</b>
<b>Is Khushi ready?</b>
<b>Err... sending her right away...</b>
<b>Good morning.</b>
<b>Looks like, these days, the
wine shops open early in the morning.</b>
<b>Who is that little girl with him?</b>
<b>She?</b>
<b>His friend...</b>
<b>she is Khushi, his friend's daughter.</b>
<b>He is coaching her.</b>
<b>She will go back in 8 to 10 days...</b>
<b>She is his friend's
daughter after all.</b>
<b>Dad...</b>
<b>Khushi...</b>
<b>is Nisha's daughter,</b>
<b>I know the truth.</b>
<b>Oh my God...</b>
<b>She knew it!</b>
<b>Hey... are you hawking
used vegetables?</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>Who the hell are you?</b>
<b>Hey! don't you have any manners?</b>
<b>And is that how you talk to kids?</b>
<b>Hey... Come over here...</b>
<b>I am Murli...</b>
<b>So?</b>
<b>I am Shravani's father...</b>
<b>Oh! Good for you... bye.</b>
<b>Wait... come back...</b>
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>-I am Khushi...
-Khushi!</b>
<b>What are you doing here?</b>
<b>Satya is my new cricket coach.</b>
<b>Oh dear...</b>
<b>there are so many super
talented coaches in the world,</b>
<b>why did you get pick this guy?</b>
<b>Murli...</b>
<b>There are so many
great grooms in the world...</b>
<b>yet you chose him for your girl.</b>
<b>Wait!</b>
<b>"After meeting you,"</b>
<b>"I felt as if the desires of my
heart have been fulfilled."</b>
<b>Khushi!</b>
<b>Hey Khushi...</b>
<b>Listen dear...</b>
<b>Khushi...</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>This is my mother's favorite song.</b>
<b>Come, listen to this one.</b>
<b>It's his Walkman...</b>
<b>So?</b>
<b>I found it there, so I took it...</b>
<b>He won't like it.</b>
<b>I'll keep it back.</b>
<b>Why do you interfere in my affairs?</b>
<b>Err. I was keeping it where it belongs...</b>
<b>You want everything
where it belongs, is it?</b>
<b>What do you intend to prove?</b>
<b>That you are a noble soul!</b>
<b>Okay, I agree,
you are a great soul...</b>
<b>So,</b>
<b>please!</b>
<b>Just stay away from me and my affairs.</b>
<b>I took your Walkman.</b>
<b>She told me you won't like it.</b>
<b>Sorry...</b>
<b>It's okay dear.</b>
<b>"Hey, brother what's wrong with you,"</b>
<b>"please tell me now."</b>
<b>"Whatever it is, forget it,
you too are getting old, so stop now."</b>
<b>"Hey, brother what's wrong with you,"</b>
<b>"please tell me now."</b>
<b>"Whatever it is, forget it,
you too are getting old, so stop now."</b>
<b>"I know someone troubled you,"</b>
<b>"broke your heart,"</b>
<b>"pained you from within..."</b>
<b>"How didn't you feel it?"</b>
<b>"My heart has gone crazy,"</b>
<b>"shocked beyond belief,"</b>
<b>"troubled and pained,"</b>
<b>"always drunk, and blabbered nonsense."</b>
<b>"I am so crazy, crazy, crazy for her."</b>
<b>"She made me go crazy,
crazy, crazy for her."</b>
<b>"I am so crazy, crazy, crazy for her."</b>
<b>"She made me go crazy,
crazy, crazy for her."</b>
<b>"She speaks so sweet..."</b>
<b>"... her words are sweeter than sugar."</b>
<b>"And whatever she speaks,"</b>
<b>"she can never be challenged."</b>
<b>"She never flared at me,"</b>
<b>"never cried because of me,"</b>
<b>"She is a darling,"</b>
<b>"yet I failed to connect with her."</b>
<b>"Only lucky few are blessed
with such a life partner...</b>
<b>"But you are such a fool to ignore her."</b>
<b>"Blame your ego for this loss."</b>
<b>"You are going crazy,
crazy, crazy for her."</b>
<b>"She made me go crazy,

<b>"I am so crazy, crazy, crazy for her."</b>
<b>"She made me go crazy,

<b>"I wish I could foretell your future,"</b>
<b>"but I have no time now..."</b>
<b>"Change your attitude,"</b>
<b>"as love is not a game."</b>
<b>"Just lovingly take her hand,
and don't let her go, brother."</b>
<b>"Don't ever be like me."</b>
<b>"I have ruined my love life,

<b>"And here, I explained to you,
what love is, in such easy words."</b>
<b>"You are going crazy,

<b>"She made you go crazy,

<b>"I am going crazy,

<b>"She made me go crazy,

<b>"Brother..."</b>
<b>"She's simply awesome."</b>
<b>I see the bat has replaced
the alcohol bottle?</b>
<b>What made him rekindle his
old forgotten passion?</b>
<b>The girl is from Delhi... I hear...</b>
<b>Who is she?</b>
<b>Find out now...</b>
<b>One scoop Vanilla...</b>
<b>Add one more for her...</b>
<b>Sure.</b>
<b>Hello, dear Khushi...</b>
<b>How are you?</b>
<b>Did you recognise me?</b>
<b>Just one scoop for me.</b>
<b>-Just one.
-No, I don't know you.</b>
<b>Nisha...</b>
<b>I am her friend, Bhaskar...</b>
<b>Didn't she tell you about me?</b>
<b>-Your mother?
-No!</b>
<b>I know you are irritated
with Satya, right?</b>
<b>Just like your mother...</b>
<b>What do you mean?</b>
<b>Didn't he mention anything
to you about your mom?</b>
<b>??</b>
<b>Of course, how will he
admit he is a cheater?</b>
<b>They had an affair...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>Satya stop it...</b>
<b>Satya stop it.</b>
<b>Stop it.</b>
<b>You knew my mother?</b>
<b>You knew my mother?</b>
<b>Were you in a relationship?</b>
<b>Who broke up?</b>
<b>My mother, or you?</b>
<b>Did you torture my mother,
just like you torture Shravani?</b>
<b>I am sure,</b>
<b>my mom dumped you...</b>
<b>Good...</b>
<b>She would've never been
happy with someone like you.</b>
<b>And one fine day,
Nisha left Satya, forever...</b>
<b>What happens when someone you love,
leaves you forever, for no reason... ?</b>
<b>I am sure you know it well.</b>
<b>Satya always dreamt...</b>
<b>to play for the 'Railways' team...</b>
<b>and then represent our country.</b>
<b>He was mad about
only two things in life...</b>
<b>Nisha...</b>
<b>and cricket.</b>
<b>She left him...</b>
<b>And he quit playing.</b>
<b>What about Shravani?</b>
<b>Just the way we all err in life...</b>
<b>God makes mistakes too...</b>
<b>Unfortunately,
God doesn't come to apologize...</b>
<b>He makes good by sending
a noble soul to look after us.</b>
<b>That's Shravani...</b>
<b>Hey Satya...</b>
<b>I am sorry...</b>
<b>It's okay...</b>
<b>Smile please...</b>
<b>A little more...</b>
<b>Little more...</b>
<b>Litter more...</b>
<b>Sir, this is just not possible</b>
<b>Shravani... a promotion, and transfer
to Nagpur, is a great opportunity for you.</b>
<b>I know it, sir...</b>
<b>You try it for two years, and
come back if it doesn't suit you.</b>
<b>You will get my profile
when you come back.</b>
<b>I am happy the way I am...</b>
<b>Shravani...</b>
<b>Nothing is more expensive
than a missed opportunity.</b>
<b>And that's exactly what I don't want to
miss... an opportunity.</b>
<b>Khushi...</b>
<b>Delhi under 14 selection
process is about to start.</b>
<b>We have 2 weeks to prepare.</b>
<b>But I want to represent
the 'Railways' team.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I want to represent
the 'Railways' team.</b>
<b>What are you talking?</b>
<b>Being a part of the Delhi team,
will get you great opportunities.</b>
<b>I am sure...</b>
<b>but I still want to represent
the 'Railways' team.</b>
<b>Look, I am your coach.</b>
<b>I will decide what's
right for you and what's not.</b>
<b>Delhi under 14. That's it.</b>
<b>Either Railway...</b>
<b>or no cricket.</b>
<b>Is she not ready yet,
for the training?</b>
<b>She has had a fever since last night.</b>
<b>Railways or no cricket...</b>
<b>Khushi is a fool...</b>
<b>how can she represent
the 'Railways' team?</b>
<b>how is that possible?</b>
<b>For that, one of her parents
should be employed at the Railways.</b>
<b>Like Shravani who works
for the Railways...</b>
<b>Now,</b>
<b>let's assume...</b>
<b>You and Shravani
decide to adopt Khushi...</b>
<b>Maybe she can represent
the 'Railways' team.</b>
<b>Adopt her...</b>
<b>I am not suggesting that...</b>
<b>I will never ask you to...</b>
<b>Adopt her!</b>
<b>That's too hot...</b>
<b>Sorry...</b>
<b>Err...</b>
<b>while washing your clothes,
I found this in your shirt pocket.</b>
<b>I was wearing a t-shirt, yesterday...</b>
<b>Perhaps...</b>
<b>I found it in your trouser pocket.</b>
<b>Forget it...</b>
<b>I have something
very important to discuss.</b>
<b>I have made up my mind...</b>
<b>(Please... Not divorce... Not divorce...)</b>
<b>It's about Khushi...</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Adopt?</b>
<b>You want to adopt Khushi?</b>
<b>Has he started boozing
in the mornings too?</b>
<b>Did you ask Shravani...</b>
<b>I like Khushi...</b>
<b>Have you too started boozing
with him in the mornings?</b>
<b>And what about...
the rich... granddad?</b>
<b>Did you discuss with him?</b>
<b>Satya...</b>
<b>I want to have a word with Shravani.</b>
<b>He wants to talk to you.</b>
<b>Shravani...</b>
<b>I am very sorry.</b>
<b>I've always succumbed
to Khushi's demands.</b>
<b>Sometimes, our contentment is in
giving into the demands of our loved ones.</b>
<b>If required, I will take her
with me, after the selection process.</b>
<b>You don't have to stick
to this arrangement.</b>
<b>Please don't worry.</b>
<b>I will take care of
her as my own daughter.</b>
<b>Shravani...</b>
<b>I am sure, even Nisha,
wouldn't have done something like this.</b>
<b>Your one decision,</b>
<b>has given us each a daughter.</b>
<b>You both have decided to adopt me...</b>
<b>and has Kumar agreed to it.</b>
<b>We will try to be good parents.</b>
<b>Okay, I don't mind.</b>
<b>But before trying to be good parents...</b>
<b>first, try to be good husband and wife.</b>
<b>Then we will see...</b>
<b>That ends her cricketing career.</b>
<b>-Good night...
-Khushi...</b>
<b>Khushi is quite adamant...</b>
<b>She is forcing me
to sleep with you...</b>
<b>I mean, in the same room.</b>
<b>But today Dad is not around,
I will sleep in his room...</b>
<b>Hello Akbar,</b>
<b>I reached home safely...</b>
<b>Now I will settle in my room and
watch 'Mughal-e-Azam' movie.</b>
<b>I will sleep in the living room.</b>
<b>I will be watching the
first half sitting in my room,</b>
<b>and the second half
in the living room.</b>
<b>I will find a place to sleep,
you don't bother.</b>
<b>No need...</b>
<b>you may sleep in my room.</b>
<b>"I offered, I sacrificed,"</b>
<b>"I surrendered myself to you,"</b>
<b>"and I experienced... "</b>
<b>"Yes... I experienced... "</b>
<b>"This bond from our past lives,"</b>
<b>"This happiness of being with you,"</b>
<b>"I finally experienced it today."</b>
<b>"It's so beautiful."</b>
<b>"It's such a different day, today."</b>
<b>"It's so enchanting."</b>
<b>"This crazy heart of mine,

<b>"Finally I know what

<b>"The joy of being with my true love."</b>
<b>"Here, we are finally connected."</b>
<b>"Finally I know what

<b>"The joy of being with my true love."</b>
<b>"Here, we are finally connected."</b>
<b>"This divine touch... "</b>
<b>"feels so heavenly."</b>
<b>"My dreams... "</b>
<b>"have come true."</b>
<b>"The relation I had with you,"</b>
<b>"now has a meaning."</b>
<b>"Now I know the

<b>"Finally I know what

<b>"Finally I know what

<b>"I don't know how this happened,"</b>
<b>"yet the joy of being with

<b>Shravani, did you perform this ritual,
during your wedding?</b>
<b>Let's go check that out...</b>
<b>"I prayed, to have you
as my partner for seven lives."</b>
<b>"Here, I wish I live
this moment forever."</b>
<b>"I feel so complete,
with you right next to me."</b>
<b>"This bond, this fragrance of love,"</b>
<b>"should never go out of my life."</b>
<b>What? 50 rupees for this?</b>
<b>Dad,</b>
<b>this kid Khushi...</b>
<b>we have adopted her...</b>
<b>She is Nisha's daughter.</b>
<b>I know...</b>
<b>She is cute...</b>
<b>just like her name...</b>
<b>From here on, you call me granddad.</b>
<b>-Do you understand?
-Okay Murli.</b>
<b>That works too...</b>
<b>Thank you!</b>
<b>"yet the joy of being with
my true love is so unreal."</b>
<b>Congratulations!</b>
<b>Why don't you coach
our 'Railways' team?</b>
<b>Yes!</b>
<b>Khushi...</b>
<b>Khushi...</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Champion!</b>
<b>Khushi...</b>
<b>Oh my God, Khushi...
You are too good.</b>
<b>Hey, Khushi... wait.</b>
<b>-Satya...
-What's the fare?</b>
<b>Khushi was fantastic today,</b>
<b>I am sure she will get selected.</b>
<b>She is far better than other players.</b>
<b>She is too good.</b>
<b>Please drop them home,</b>
<b>I will join you later.</b>
<b>Satya, please don't...</b>
<b>Everything is fine now,</b>
<b>don't mess it up.</b>
<b>Please go home.</b>
<b>Yes... True...</b>
<b>Let's leave...</b>
<b>Where is he?</b>
<b>He has some important
work to attend...</b>
<b>He asked us to leave.</b>
<b>-Oh, okay...
-Come.</b>
<b>Sorry... I am late...</b>
<b>There was a call
from the association,</b>
<b>There were some pending formalities
pertaining to Khushi's selection,</b>
<b>to be completed.</b>
<b>The authorities are all
impressed with her performance.</b>
<b>They feel</b>
<b>she has the spark to
be a part of the National team.</b>
<b>Everything is possible
when you are with her.</b>
<b>She will get selected for sure.</b>
<b>It's not just because of me...</b>
<b>It's... because of us.</b>
<b>Everything seems so different
from the time she is with us.</b>
<b>I mean...</b>
<b>in the last few days,</b>
<b>whatever is happening between us,</b>
<b>It's all fake...</b>
<b>This façade is just for Khushi's sake.</b>
<b>I have not forgotten anything.</b>
<b>I know, you don't want me around.</b>
<b>I know it very well, we had
to bond, just for the sake of Khushi.</b>
<b>Spend time together in one room.</b>
<b>I feel she is settled now.</b>
<b>We can now stop
acting in front of her.</b>
<b>You can go back to your old self.</b>
<b>I am used to it anyway.</b>
<b>Shravani...</b>
<b>Shravani dear...</b>
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>
<b>Everything is falling in place now...</b>
<b>and why are you suddenly
relocating to Nagpur?</b>
<b>You won't understand.</b>
<b>I've been promoted...
should I just refuse the offer?</b>
<b>You don't have to go...</b>
<b>Just tender your resignation.</b>
<b>Firstly, I was never in
favour of you marrying him.</b>
<b>Now I just don't agree to your decision
of moving out of this house.</b>
<b>Are you really moving out?</b>
<b>Am I so bad,</b>
<b>that you are leaving me behind?</b>
<b>No dear...</b>
<b>Then why do you have to go?</b>
<b>Look, I will be in touch with you,</b>
<b>Also, soon your granddad
will take you home.</b>
<b>I don't want to go with him.</b>
<b>I want to be with you.</b>
<b>Please don't go, mom!</b>
<b>When did you get to
know about your transfer?</b>
<b>Yesterday!</b>
<b>Last week, I heard from your boss,</b>
<b>you refused the offer then...</b>
<b>and now suddenly you are leaving.</b>
<b>What changed in a week?</b>
<b>Do you really have to go?</b>
<b>Do you even know me?</b>
<b>We've been married
for seven years now.</b>
<b>I vividly remember
each day of our life.</b>
<b>Do you even...</b>
<b>recollect a single moment?</b>
<b>When I was a kid, a boy
shattered our window glass.</b>
<b>I peeped out of my window,</b>
<b>and could never take my eyes off him.</b>
<b>It wasn't just a ball that entered
my house through the window.</b>
<b>That's when this young
boy came into my life.</b>
<b>He changed my life completely.</b>
<b>I followed him everywhere.</b>
<b>I became his shadow.</b>
<b>As I grew...</b>
<b>I realised...</b>
<b>This madness is called...</b>
<b>Love!</b>
<b>My life became all about him,</b>
<b>and I didn't even fleetingly
feature in his thoughts.</b>
<b>But I was happy,</b>
<b>because it was the truth.</b>
<b>He was in love with someone else.</b>
<b>I accepted it...</b>
<b>because it was the truth.</b>
<b>Years later,</b>
<b>I adamantly married him...</b>
<b>but I could never be his wife.</b>
<b>I accepted it...</b>
<b>because it was the truth.</b>
<b>In the last few days,</b>
<b>we lived like one happy family.</b>
<b>I was living my dream.</b>
<b>But,</b>
<b>but... yesterday...</b>
<b>I saw him enter the hotel...</b>
<b>And I realised...</b>
<b>everything that I thought real...</b>
<b>was in fact, a lie.</b>
<b>And this lie is troubling me.</b>
<b>I know I am at the wrong platform.</b>
<b>However long I wait, I will never
be able to board the right train.</b>
<b>Enough now...</b>
<b>I came to bid you goodbye,
before we part ways.</b>
<b>Didn't I tell you?</b>
<b>either one of us should
maintain the account.</b>
<b>I went to the hotel,
to bid goodbye to my past...</b>
<b>... forever.</b>
<b>Shravani, I may have erred...</b>
<b>but I was never a liar.</b>
<b>I knew,</b>
<b>I have you...</b>
<b>I took you for granted.</b>
<b>She was always there to support,</b>
<b>when I boozed and lost my balance.</b>
<b>For everyone who abused me,</b>
<b>she fought with them, for me.</b>
<b>I attempted to end my life,</b>
<b>she was there again,
to save my life.</b>
<b>What you thought was fake,</b>
<b>indeed was all real.</b>
<b>Every moment was real,</b>
<b>just the way it is now.</b>
<b>This is the first time
you are leaving me all alone.</b>
<b>You fell in love,</b>
<b>so did I...</b>
<b>There is madness in you...</b>
<b>... and in me too.</b>
<b>Some madly fall in love...</b>
<b>And some...</b>
<b>are the madness, in love.</b>
<b>The only difference is...</b>
<b>You loved me...</b>
<b>And I</b>
<b>started loving you.</b>
<b>I...</b>
<b>I love you, Shravani.</b>
<b>What if I still want to go?</b>
<b>It's okay...</b>
<b>It's perfectly fine...</b>
<b>... as I will be your shadow,
from now on.</b>
<b>You were not waiting at
the wrong platform.</b>
<b>This (me) train got a bit delayed,</b>
<b>"One was passionate, crazy in love..."</b>
<b>"And the other became crazy
in love but never so knew..."</b>
<b>"The one who blossomed in love...
just dried and wilted away"</b>
<b>"but the one that Shrivelled
didn't lose hope in love... "</b>
<b>"This yearning is sure sweet..."</b>
<b>"The final longing or a new beginning..."</b>
<b>"It is your bright heart
That has illuminated mine..."</b>
<b>You are not leaving, right?</b>
<b>I can't...</b>
<b>This is a goods train!</b>
<b>"I finally experienced
the real happiness today."</b>
<b>"I don't know how this happened,"</b>
<b>"yet the joy of being with
my true love is so unreal."</b>
<b>"My heart is so restless,"</b>
<b>"I can't live a moment
without you."</b>
<b>"Let's just melt into each other,"</b>
<b>"embrace me oh dear."</b>
<b>"This unexpected fire in me,"</b>
<b>"makes me so anxious."</b>
<b>"I have wasted my body and soul,"</b>
<b>"just for you, my dear."</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
makes this distance unbearable."</b>
<b>"Madness for you, makes me
crave for your innocent love"</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
is the reason I live for."</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
makes this distance unbearable."</b>
<b>"Madness for you, makes me
crave for your innocent love"</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
is the reason I live for."</b>
<b>"Unknowingly my body
trembles in your presence."</b>
<b>"And I yearn for
your sweet fragrance."</b>
<b>"My love for your innocent emotions,
makes my heart feel a bit shy... "</b>
<b>"...yet seeing you,
my eyes bloom with joy."</b>
<b>"This unexpected fire in me,"</b>
<b>"makes me so anxious."</b>
<b>"I have wasted my body and soul,"</b>
<b>"just for you, my dear."</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
makes this distance unbearable."</b>
<b>"Madness for you, makes me
crave for your innocent love"</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
is the reason I live for."</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
makes this distance unbearable."</b>
<b>"Madness for you, makes me
crave for your innocent love"</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
is the reason I live for."</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
makes this distance unbearable."</b>
<b>"Madness for you, makes me
crave for your innocent love"</b>
<b>"Madness for you,
is the reason I live for."</b>
