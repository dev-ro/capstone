- Willy, what are you doing downtown?
- I'm working. What are you doing?
He's working.
I hate them.
I hate Frumpies potato chips so much,
I can't stop eating them.
And I keep eating Frumpies
until I love them...
which I hope is never.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Bell.
Mr. Gilbert is next.
Right.
Mr. Gilbert!
I mean, I think the accent
could work for us.
Bearing in mind the... business, you know.
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Mr. Gilbert,
this is our director, Mr. Walsk...
Mr. Blair, Mr. Ott, Miss Baker,
and Miss Hall.
- You saw the copy?
- I looked through it.
Whenever you're ready.
Boy! I hate them!
I hate Frumpies potato chips so much,
I can't stop eating them.
And I'll keep on eating Frumpies
till I love them...
which, I hope, will be never.
Would you mind
eating the potato chip, please?
I can't. I got gallstones.
Right.
- Okay, thank you for your...
- Willy Clark?
Give me five more minutes.
He's on his way.
- He left 20 minutes ago.
- He's 40 minutes late already.
If he's not here by 11:00, forget it.
Crazy freaking old man!
Sir.
- What is it?
- I'm here. Willy Clark.
- So?
- Willy Clark. I'm here.
- Here to pick up a car?
- What?
- You here to pick up a car?
- What do I need a car for?
- Then what do you want?
- I'm here. The potato chips.
I'm here for the potato chip commercial.
Willy Clark.
This is a garage.
- What is this?
- Let me see that.
- This looks like a garage to me.
- Is this the address you're looking for?
- Yeah.
- The Danzig Advertising Agency?
- That's it.
- 354 East 43rd Street.
This is West 43rd. You want East.
- This is not the agency?
- You didn't hear what I just said?
This is West Side. You want the East Side.
Is my nephew here? Ben Clark?
He'll fix it. I don't handle the business.
What are you, deaf or something?
Look, you got to go across town.
I don't make commercials.
I fix transmissions.
Why don't you take a look?
Maybe in the back
they make the commercials.
- Pops, take a walk. I'm very busy.
- It wouldn't kill you to look, would it?
East! East 43rd Street,
for Christ's sake. East!
Don't get fresh with me!
I got a few years on you
before you get fresh with me.
Sends me to a garage.
Right! Turn it to the right!
The right! Turn it to the right! Pull it!
The other way! East!
Don't tell me!
I've lived in New York all my life!
Okay, very nice. Thank you.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
There's one no-show, Willy Clark.
You wanna wait?
No way. The man can't remember lines.
Drove me crazy last year
with the corn flakes.
My first choice would be the guy
with the Kraut accent.
He's here. He just got here.
He got held up in traffic. I told you.
Uncle Willy, in here.
Where were you? You're over an hour late!
I was on time. You sent me over
to a garage all the way on the West Side.
- Who told you to go to there?
- It's on the paper.
No, it isn't. It says East 43rd.
I didn't trust you.
You always make mistakes.
I've got three minutes left.
Do you wanna try this once?
- Who's this?
- This is Mr. Walsk. He's the director.
- Mr. Walsk, Willy Clark.
- How do you do? I'm Willy Clark.
We met. You auditioned for me last year.
I don't remember that.
When was that? Last year?
Yes, that was last year.
Mr. Clark, I am very short on time here.
I literally have about three minutes...
so if you'd like to do it once,
that's about it.
I'm ready. I know the whole thing.
Anytime you say.
- Just give me 10 minutes.
- I don't have 10 minutes, Mr. Clark.
He's ready, Mr. Walsk.
If you'll just stand right over there,
where everyone can see you.
- There.
- Where?
- There is fine.
- Over here?
Yes.
How about over here?
The light is better here.
Don't worry about the light.
We're not shooting yet.
I can see you fine there.
You're the director.
I just thought that maybe
you'd like it better over there.
Give him the bag.
What's this?
It's the product, Mr. Clark.
The potato chips.
You got a fresher bag? This one is soggy.
Mr. Clark, I have three minutes left.
Do you want to do this or not?
He's only got three minutes.
I heard the man. I'm not deaf.
I'm a professional.
I'm ready whenever he's ready,
but the bag was soggy.
Okay, Mr. Clark, I'm ready.
Now, if you'll take a bite of the potato chip
and read the copy.
- The what?
- The copy.
They didn't give you the copy?
You didn't give it to him?
- The lines, Uncle Willy.
- The lines. Certainly.
Why didn't he say so?
I didn't know what the hell copy was.
You ready?
I'm ready. I swear to God I'm ready.
Just bite the potato chip
and begin, please.
- What do I say?
- Forget it. Thank you very much, Mr. Clark.
Get me the guy with the beard,
or the Kraut. Doesn't matter.
Mr. Clark, a real pleasure
seeing you again.
- Thank you very much.
- Please, Mr. Walsk.
As a favor to me, let him read through
the commercial one time.
By the time he finishes reading,
potatoes will be an endangered species.
- I'm ready again. I remembered.
- I don't care!
Just as a courtesy. He was
one of the biggest stars in vaudeville.
He deserves one reading.
If the man can't work,
why doesn't he retire?
Mr. Walsk, don't do this to me.
Please. I'll pay you to let him read.
Once. Let him read through it,
and that's it.
- And I'll be damned if I'll listen.
- Here, Uncle Willy. Read it from this.
- I don't need it. I remember the lines.
- Read it!
- Get out, Ben, I got my own copy.
- Where is it?
Where did I put it?
Here. Just read it through once
and don't stop, okay?
You don't have to tell me.
I'm a professional.
I'm in this business 57 years.
- Sends me to a garage.
- Okay, Mr. Clark.
I hate them.
- I hate Chumpies potato chips...
- Frumpies.
I hate them.
- I hate Frunchies potato chips so much...
- Frumpies!
- Frunkies potato chips...
- Frumpies!
Can't you just say "Frumpies"?
If it was funny, I would say it.
So what do you think?
About what?
The money. How much money
you think they want to pay me?
Who?
The potato chips.
I'm not doing it unless the money is right.
You think they're going to hire you?
You come an hour late,
can't remember the address or the lines.
I remembered the lines.
The name of the potato chips
I couldn't remember.
- What was it again?
- Frumpies.
- Say it again.
- Frumpies!
Still can't remember it
'cause it's not funny.
I'm in this business 57 years.
You learn a few things.
You know what makes an audience laugh.
You know which words are funny
and which words are not.
You told me 100 times.
I have to get to the office.
- Which words are funny?
- Words with a "K" in it.
I have to get to the office.
Words with a "K" in it.
You didn't know that, did you?
I'll tell you which words
always get a laugh.
- "Alka-Seltzer"?
- "Alka-Seltzer" is funny.
- "Chicken"?
- "Chicken" is funny.
- "Pickle."
- "Pickle" is funny.
All with a "K."
"L's" are not funny. "M's" are not funny.
- Just "K's." I know.
- "Cupcake" is funny.
"Tomatoes" is not funny.
"Lettuce" is not funny.
You've explained that to me
since I was five.
- I've got to get back to the office.
- "Cucumber" is funny.
It's getting cold out.
I'm gonna give you money. Take a cab.
- "Cab" is funny.
- Are you listening to me?
"Cockroach" is funny.
Not getting them, saying them.
- Will you listen to me?
- A little respect.
How about some respect for me?
I'm also a human being.
We'll see. You're young. You got time yet.
- Please cut that out.
- Can I have my mail, please?
Please cut it out!
How many times I have to tell you?
Don't hit the bell.
What's the matter con you?
Give me my mail, I won't hit the bell.
- No mail.
- What do you mean, no mail?
I say no mail. What's the matter?
Don't you understand English?
When you speak it, I'll understand it.
"What's the matter con you?" Chumpies.
Glunkies. I hate them.
Klunkies...
Tells me over there, the Spanish kid,
he tells me I have no mail.
He probably stole it.
They stole my shoes last week.
Three pairs of good shoes.
Who would want your shoes?
I get important mail.
We're stuck!
Spanish kid!
You live in a crappy hotel,
you get a crappy elevator!
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's him. 2:00 in the morning.
- How do you know it's him?
- I know.
- Listen to it.
- Ben, answer the phone!
- Hello?
- Who's this? Ben?
- What's wrong, Uncle Willy?
- That you, Ben?
- You called me, didn't you?
- Don't yell.
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?
- Do you know what...
- You'll wake the children.
Do you know what time it is?
What time it is.
10:15.
10:15? Try 2:05
Why should I try 2:05 when it's 10:15?
It's not 10:15! It's 2:05 in the morning.
You didn't wind your clock again today,
did you?
No. So because you didn't wind your clock,
I have to get up at 2:00 in the morning.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
Are you sleeping now?
How could I be sleeping
when I'm up talking to you?
So, as long as you're up,
did you hear from the potato chips?
Yes. They said they're not interested.
Positively?
I'm sorry, Uncle Willy.
I'll keep looking, I promise.
But not tonight. Let's all get some sleep.
I'll be up to see you Wednesday.
Helen sends her love.
- Good night, Uncle Willy.
- When are you coming up? Wednesday?
Yeah. Probably Wednesday.
Good night, Willy.
All right, I won't bother you anymore.
See you Wednesday.
Don't forget my Variety and the cigars.
You listening?
And tell the potato chips
I turned them down.
I'm not interested anymore.
To hell with all of them.
We've got a deal,
if you think you can deliver them.
They're both dying to work together.
Nothing's come along until this
that's excited them.
I'll have the contract signed
and on your desk by Monday.
But when I think of what Jim
has done to Jessie
And he's not really sorry, I can tell
When a man is caught on alcohol,
he's a whole other person
He doesn't want to admit
Hello? Who's this?
Never mind. It's the tea.
He was drinking when I first knew him,
but it was never like this
And even now,
I suppose there are one or two days
when he doesn't take a drink
but I don't know
We'll be back with General Hospital
right after this brief message
from Lipton tea
Don't worry, I'm not going anyplace.
And now for part three
of today's General Hospital
What happened to part two?
I miss part two?
- Uncle Willy, it's me.
- Who's that?
- Ben!
- Ben, is that you?
- Yes, Willy, it's me. Ben. Open the door.
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
Wait a minute!
- What's wrong?
- I'm locked in. The lock is broken.
I'm locked in.
Go down and tell the Spanish kid.
Tell him in Spanish. They'll get somebody.
It's not broken.
You just have to slide it out.
- Don't force it.
- What?
Uncle Willy, do you hear me?
Don't try to... Uncle Willy!
Do you hear me?
Don't try to force, just slide it out.
Don't force it.
It's open. Never mind. I fixed it myself.
- You probably have to oil it.
- I think I have to oil it.
I didn't think of that.
Jesus. It's cold in here.
Don't they ever send up any steam?
In July, they send up steam.
What the hell is wrong with this?
Come on, you piece of crap!
Work, already!
Uncle Willy, I have to talk to you.
Lousy Japs. They lost the war,
so they send us their junk.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I just came
from the most exciting meeting...
- What are you doing?
- What?
The doctor said
you can't smoke cigars anymore.
Who's smoking?
Do you see smoke coming from the cigar?
- But you got it in your mouth.
- I'm rehearsing. I'll do the show later.
- ABC called me this...
- How do you like that? Sol Burton died.
- Who?
- Sol Burton, songwriter.
89 years old,
and he went just like that, from nothing.
Anyway, ABC called me...
You know what kind of songs
he wrote? Shit.
Lady, lady, be my baby
"Lady" rhymes with "baby."
No wonder he's dead.
Will you put down Variety
and listen to me?
I left three clients in my office
so I could come here.
That makes four of us out of work.
How's the children?
Since when are you interested
in my children?
You haven't seen them in a year.
You don't even remember their names.
- Milly and Sidney.
- Amanda and Michael.
What's the matter?
You didn't like Milly and Sidney?
You forgot, so you made something up.
You forget everything,
like buying fresh food. Listen. ABC called...
Do they know who I am,
what a great star I was?
- Who?
- Amanda and Sifkin.
Amanda and Michael.
They're 3 years old.
They don't remember vaudeville.
Why is it I only get aggravated
when I come over here to see you?
If you want, I'll meet you someplace else.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I don't think that's funny.
If you had a sense of humor,
you'd think it was funny.
- I have a terrific sense of humor!
- Like your father. He laughed once in 1932.
Why couldn't you get me this commercial?
You forgot you auditioned?
You kept calling it toilet paper.
Will you listen to me? Please listen to me.
I heard. You got a call from NBC.
- ABC!
- Same thing.
ABC is doing a big television special
next month.
It's an hour-and-a-half variety show
with the biggest names in show business.
The theme of the show
is the history of comedy...
dating from Greek theater,
through vaudeville, up to today's stars.
What's the theme of the show?
The theme of the show
is the history of comedy...
dating from Greek theater,
through vaudeville, up to today's stars.
- Why couldn't you get me on that show?
- I got you on that show.
- Alone?
- $10,000.
- Alone?
- Gonna be the biggest show of the year.
- Alone.
- No.
- With Lewis?
- Yes.
- Then you ain't got me on the show.
- Will you let me finish?
- You're finished. It's no.
- Can't we discuss it?
- We've discussed it. I'm busy.
- Doing what?
- Not discussing it.
- You could have the courtesy...
You could have the courtesy
of hearing me out.
ABC said to me the history of comedy
wouldn't be complete...
without one of the greatest teams
to ever come out of vaudeville:
Lewis and Clark, the Sunshine Boys.
The vice president said this to me
in his office.
The vice president said this?
He's the greatest Lewis and Clark fan
in the country, since he was a kid.
He knows by heart all of your old routines.
Then let him go on with that bastard.
One shot. One night,
you do one of the old sketches.
They pay $10,000 for the team.
That's top money for these shows,
I promise you.
I don't need any money. I live alone.
I got two nice suits.
I don't have a pussycat to bother me.
- I'm very happy.
- You're not happy. You're miserable.
- Get me a job, I won't be so miserable.
- I've tried.
Nobody's worked harder
for a client than I have.
Look, you're a nice boy.
You come to visit me every Wednesday.
You bring me lousy soups
which I don't eat.
You're a wonderful nephew,
but you're a lousy agent.
I'm a good agent, damn it!
Don't say that to me.
I'm a goddamn good agent!
I'm getting chest pains.
You give me chest pains.
- It's my fault you get excited?
- Yes!
- I only get chest pains on Wednesdays.
- So come on Tuesdays.
You know what? I'm going.
I don't even want to discuss this anymore.
You're impossible to talk to.
Forget the variety show.
I forgot it.
I'll tell you the truth, Uncle Willy.
Maybe you'd be better off
with another agent.
I accept your offer.
Don't call me anymore, will you, please?
Not for business.
Handle your own affairs, okay?
- From now on, you're just my uncle.
- Take care of yourself.
Say hello to Milly and Phyllis.
It's still no!
What's wrong? Who are you calling?
Ben, it's 1:00 in the morning.
- Why won't you do this for me?
- Who's that? Ben?
I'm not asking you to be partners again,
but it's just for one night, one last show.
Once you get an exposure like this,
Alka-Seltzer will beg me to sign you up.
Jesus! How will it look
if I go to the office tomorrow...
and say I couldn't make a deal
with my own uncle?
My personal opinion? Lousy.
Uncle Willy!
Wait a minute!
Willy. Willy Clark!
Don't make me crazy today.
Will you please stop and wait for me?
For who? Who are you?
Willy, will you cut it...
Where are you going?
You know, a new musical
went into rehearsal today...
and I didn't get an audition.
Why didn't I get an audition?
Because the show is all black,
and you're not black.
I did black in 1928.
And when I did black,
you understood the words.
Not like today.
I spoke to Al Lewis' daughter
on the phone. He's very interested.
What does he know? He's senile.
- You really hate Al Lewis that much?
- I don't discuss that person anymore.
We have to discuss him.
ABC is waiting for an answer.
- Ben, this is it.
- This is what?
CBS. This is where we did
the Ed Sullivan Show.
Six times they had us back,
not including reruns.
I remember. I saw you. I was here
when you did the doctor sketch.
- It was terrific.
- It wasn't.
- Yes, it was.
- It wasn't terrific. It was a classic.
On the nights we were lousy
it was terrific.
Then why won't you work with him again
for one night?
- Because of artistic differences.
- What artistic differences?
I hate the son of a bitch,
that's what artistic differences.
- Come on. I'll buy you lunch.
- I had lunch.
Maybe you ate, but you didn't have lunch.
In here, you have lunch.
Hello, Tiny. How are you?
When was the last time you saw Al Lewis?
Eleven years ago. I'm not discussing it.
Sam, say hello to my nephew.
If he was your agent,
you wouldn't be working.
- Hello, nephew.
- Hello, Sam.
Bring us two Sophie Tuckers
and two cream sodas.
- I'm not eating anything.
- Bring it. I'll take his home in a bag.
You mean to tell me you haven't
spoken to Al Lewis in 11 years?
I haven't seen him in 11 years.
I haven't spoken to him in 12 years.
You know they still got a sandwich here
named after me?
Look at this. The number five combination:
Tongue, hot pastrami, salami,
coleslaw, Russian dressing.
A Willy Clark special. That's a star.
You didn't speak to him for a whole year?
What about on stage?
If he played a gypsy,
I would speak to the gypsy.
If he played a lunatic,
I would speak to the lunatic.
But that bastard, I didn't speak to.
You're not supposed to eat pickles.
It's high sodium.
I'll spit out the sodium.
Thank you.
Just tell me what's wrong with Al Lewis.
He seemed nice enough when I met him.
- Did you ever meet him?
- I just said I did.
I was 13 years old.
It was backstage at some benefit.
I forget the theater.
He was very sweet to me.
Maybe he thought you were a midget.
He loved them...
- but people, he hated. Especially partners.
- Just the shoes, not the socks, please.
Why? What did he do
that bothered you so much?
What did he do?
He used to give me the finger.
- The what?
- The finger!
He would poke me in the chest
with the finger.
I'm telling you, Doctor.
You know what I mean, Doctor?
You hear what I'm saying, Doctor?
That hurts, doesn't it? 43 years.
How would you like that?
I had a black-and-blue hole in my chest.
Till her dying day, my wife
thought it was a tattoo over there.
If you work with him,
I'll buy you a padded undershirt.
You think I didn't try?
Once I put a steel plate under my shirt.
He gave me the finger,
he had it in a splint for a month.
Willy, what if I set up a meeting
between you two, maybe lunch at Sardi's.
To talk things out?
I'll be there all the time.
Want to hear other things?
He used to spit in my face.
- On stage, the man would spit in my face.
- Not on purpose.
He tells me not on purpose.
If I could have saved the spit,
I'd show you.
He would stand there
and spit in your face?
You think he's stupid?
He'd work it into the act.
He would stand
with his nose under my nose...
and he would purposely say words
only that began with a "T."
Tootsie roll. Tinkertoy.
- Typing on the typewriter.
- Would you please sign in your guest, sir?
He's not my guest. He's my nephew.
Some nights I thought I would drown.
I don't know where he got it all from.
I think he would drink all day
and save it up for the night.
Don't put this near the steam.
It's corned beef.
What if I put it into the contract...
if he pokes you or spits at you,
he doesn't get paid?
He doesn't care.
He would spit at me for free.
Then will you answer me one question?
If it was all that bad,
why did you stick together for 43 years?
- Why?
- Yes, why?
Because he was terrific.
There'll never be another one like him.
Nobody could time a joke
the way he could time a joke.
Nobody could say a line the way he said it.
We each knew
what the other was thinking.
One person, that's what we were.
No, no...
Al Lewis was the best.
The best, you understand?
- I understand.
- As an actor, no one could touch him.
As a human being,
no one wanted to touch him.
Uncle Willy, people do change.
You know his wife died three years ago?
He lives with his daughter now,
somewhere in New Jersey.
He doesn't do anything anymore.
He's got very bad arthritis,
he's got poor blood circulation.
I'll send him a pump.
He'll outlive you, believe me.
I spoke to his daughter.
He wants very much to do this show.
With arthritis? Forget it.
Instead of a finger,
he'll poke me with a cane.
What if I went out to New Jersey
and spoke to him...
explained how you felt,
see if we could work things out?
Uncle Willy, do I have your permission
to go and speak to him?
- Go speak to him.
- Thank you.
But take a towel with you. I'm sorry.
- Mr. Clark?
- Sorry I'm late. I got off the wrong exit.
Come in. Dad just got up from his nap.
He's out in the sunroom.
He likes to be up
when the children get home.
Mrs. Green, can I ask you a question?
How is his health?
I mean, is he up to doing this show
if it all works out?
I think it would be
the best thing in the world for him.
And he takes very good care of himself.
- He's just a little slow, that's all.
- What do you mean, slow?
He doesn't like to be rushed.
He lets the phone ring eight or nine times
before answering it.
He'll take an hour before he opens a letter.
He was always like that.
Just the opposite of Willy.
I always wondered
how they put up with each other.
Dad, Mr. Clark is here.
Dad, it's Mr. Clark. He's here.
- What?
- It's Ben Clark, Willy's nephew.
Willy's nephew?
How do you do, Mr. Lewis?
I'm Ben Clark, Willy's nephew.
Willy's nephew, Ben.
Sure. Hello, how are you?
- Fine, sir.
- Good, good.
You're Willy's nephew. Ben, how are you?
Fine, sir. Very good.
It was nice of you to see me.
Really? When was that?
Today.
- It was nice of you to see me today.
- Certainly. Today is fine.
As a matter of fact,
I was expecting you today.
Please sit down, Mr. Clark.
- Why doesn't he sit down?
- Thank you very much.
- Can I get you anything before I go?
- No, thanks. I had lunch before I drove out.
Then I'll leave you two alone.
I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
Thank you.
- Can my daughter get you anything?
- No, I had lunch before I drove out.
What did you have?
- What did I have?
- For lunch.
Chicken salad sandwich
and a cup of coffee.
I had a fruit compote and cottage cheese.
Can you stay awhile?
My grandchildren will be home
from school soon. Wendy and Mark.
Yes, if I can.
You know, we met before, a long time ago.
My father took me backstage.
I forget the theater.
It must've been 15 or 20 years ago.
Do you remember that?
Certainly. It was backstage.
Maybe 15, 20 years ago.
I forget the theater.
- That's right.
- Sure, I remember.
Haven't had chicken salad in years.
So, Mr. Lewis, you must be very excited.
I know I am.
About what?
About working again.
Doing the old act with Uncle Willy.
I did it over 11,000 times.
11,001 doesn't get me excited.
I can tell you ABC is very excited.
We'll see. How much did you say
they were going to pay?
- $10,000 for the team.
- That's $5,000 apiece, isn't it?
That's what it comes to, yes.
I don't have an agent anymore. He died.
- I don't pay commission, you know.
- Certainly. I understand.
Don't mind buying you a little gift,
but no commission.
It's okay, really. Then you agree?
You're willing to do the show
with Uncle Willy?
- He hates my guts, you know.
- No, he never said that to me.
- What?
- He never said that to me.
How old are you?
Why?
I'd like to say something.
How old are you?
I'm 33.
He called me a son of a bitch bastard.
- The kids aren't home yet, are they?
- I don't think so.
Son of a bitch bastard, because I retired.
I just didn't
feel like doing the act anymore.
- Forty-seven years is enough, isn't it?
- Certainly.
- What?
- Certainly.
Eleven thousand times, the same jokes.
- Was I wrong for doing what I did?
- Absolutely not.
- What?
- Absolutely not.
So why does he
say such things about me?
I don't hate him.
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I can't stand him, but I don't hate him.
He doesn't hate you either.
I guess he was just upset
about breaking up the team...
after all those wonderful years.
That's understandable, isn't it?
No.
Anyway, I'm sure once you two
see each other again...
What did you say? $5,000 apiece?
I don't pay commission, you know.
- Yes.
- My agent died.
- You told me.
- And they weren't such wonderful years.
Someday I'll tell you.
- I'd love to hear about how you and Uncle...
- Sure, I remember.
It was backstage, maybe 15, 20 years ago.
I forget the theater.
Why didn't you leave a message?
I looked everywhere.
You purposely went out...
so we wouldn't have to talk.
I'll be at the club, playing cards.
No kidding.
Can I speak to you for a minute?
Where's your manners?
Don't you say hello?
This is Arthur Marx, a great young singer...
and this is Benny Friedman,
a terrific new comic.
How do you do?
- Now can we talk?
- Did you pick up a three of hearts?
He'll do it. He's agreed to it all...
the money, dates, the doctor sketch.
He agreed to come from New Jersey
to rehearse in your hotel...
and he was as sweet as he can be.
Now, he's waiting for me to tell him
what time to come in...
and then I have to call ABC
and tell them we have a deal, okay?
- Uncle Willy, are you listening to me?
- I knock with five.
ABC is waiting!
What's their rush?
Are they going out of business?
I'm calling and telling Al Lewis we have...
Wait a minute, I don't trust him!
He'll rehearse with me all week...
and then he'll walk out
just before the show.
That's what he did the last time,
the bastard.
- He won't walk out.
- On the Ed Sullivan Show...
he walked out on me.
Retires right in the middle of my career.
A man can retire whenever he wants to.
Yes, but I wasn't ready yet!
Anyway, he's sick now.
You told me
he's got everything wrong with him.
He's well enough
to remember his grandchildren's names.
- It's ringing.
- Sixty-forty. All right, sixty-forty.
I get $6,000, he gets $4,000.
What the hell can he buy
in New Jersey, anyway?
- It's gonna be all right. I promise you.
- Tell him I'm against it.
I want him to know
I'll do the show with an "against it."
He's got to be home.
I told him I would call.
You know what he's doing?
He's practicing spitting.
Hello, Mr. Lewis. It's Ben again.
Ben. Willy Clark's nephew.
He forgot already.
He's got arthritis of the head.
- It's okay, Mr. Lewis. Willy said yes.
- Yes, with an "against it."
No, he's very anxious to do it.
Who's anxious? Tell him I'm against it!
Damn you, nephew! Lousy nephew!
Monday at his hotel. How's 11:00?
What is it, a two-hour drive?
Make it 9:00.
No, that's the television set.
Will you shut up?
All right, listen to me.
If he spits or he pokes,
I'm taking him to court.
You hear me? I'm taking him to court.
Listen to me...
One spit or poke,
and I'm gonna take him to court!
Ten to twenty years for a spit in the face!
Tell him! No toys, telephones...
typing on the typewriter!
...you go down Broadway to 74th Street,
the Ansonia Hotel.
Ben Clark. Willy Clark's nephew.
- My God, they're both the same!
- I'm going back to the game.
- Are you nervous?
- Me? Nervous? Why should I be nervous?
- What time you want me to pick you up?
- Call me, every hour on the hour.
Hello, is this the Spanish kid?
Willy Clark. Listen,
don't tell my nephew that I'm home.
No, not...
No enchilada. Tell him I went out. I'm out.
I'm not here, you understand?
I'm not here.
- Wait. Who's that?
- Uncle Willy, it's Ben.
He's here. Never mind, idiot.
- Uncle Willy.
- Ben, is that you?
Yes, open up.
Wait a minute.
- You're alone, or he's with you?
- I'm alone.
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Wait a minute.
- Slide it, don't push it.
- Wait a minute, I'll push it.
Don't push it. Slide it.
Slide it.
- I think you're supposed to slide it.
- I rushed like crazy.
I didn't want him here before me.
- Did he call or anything?
- Who?
You're parked too close. It's filthy here.
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No, just wait till I get to the lobby.
Probably get mugged.
He's late.
He's purposely coming late
to aggravate me.
He's not late. It's two minutes after 11:00.
So what is he, early?
I'm telling you, he's late.
I was up at 8:00 in the morning
and dressed.
You call that dressed? You're half-dressed!
So for him I should get all dressed?
- Why didn't you shave?
- Get me the Schick commercial, I'll shave.
I think I got hepatitis.
Here, look how green I look.
Wonder if I should call him.
Maybe he's sick.
You believe he's sick.
But me, you don't believe.
Maybe you should become his nephew.
Will you stop it, Uncle Willy,
and behave yourself?
What do you mean behave yourself?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Susan and Jackie?
Amanda and Jackie. Michael.
I wish I were. I can reason with...
I'm having chest pains on Monday.
- That's him. You want me to get it?
- Get what? I didn't hear anything.
I think it would be a nice gesture,
Uncle Willy, if you opened the door.
Please. You promised me
you'd give it a chance.
I'll give it every chance in the world,
but it's not going to work.
- Where are you going?
- To make some tea.
- I feel like some hot tea.
- Now?
- Hello, Mr. Lewis. How are you?
- Hello, how are you? I'm Al Lewis.
Yes, of course. Come on in.
Uncle Willy is making some tea.
Please sit down.
Thank you very much.
Did you have any trouble
getting in from Jersey?
My daughter drove me in. She has a car.
That's nice.
1973 Chrysler. The lmperial.
- Yes, it's a wonderful car.
- Good car.
Do you get into New York often?
- Today is the first time in two years.
- Really? How did you find it?
My daughter drove.
Right.
Uncle Willy, how are we doing?
It's not boiling yet.
- Would you care for any tea, Mr. Lewis?
- Tea would be nice, thank you.
Mr. Lewis would like tea, too.
- I only got one ball.
- Well, dunk twice.
- May I take your coat, Mr. Lewis?
- We'll see. Maybe later.
Do you have any questions
you want to ask about the show...
about the studio, or rehearsals,
or the airdate? Things like that?
Like what?
Like the studio, or the rehearsals,
or the airdate. Things like that.
- Have you got the props?
- What props are those?
The props for the doctor sketch.
You gotta have props.
Props, certainly.
What do you need? I'll tell them.
You need a desk...
a telephone, a pointer...
a blackboard, some white chalk...
some red chalk, a skeleton, not too tall...
a stethoscope,
a thermometer, an aah-stick...
- Wait a minute. What's an "ostick"?
- To put in your mouth to say "aah."
- Right. An aah-stick.
- An aah-stick.
A bottle of pills, big ones, like for a horse.
- About this big?
- No, that's for a pony.
For a horse it's like this.
- Some bandages, cotton, an eye chart...
- Wait a minute. You're going too fast.
A desk.
A telephone.
- A pointer.
- I got all that.
I mean after the cotton and the eye chart.
A man's suit, size 38.
Like the one I'm wearing.
- Usually they let me keep it.
- Also in blue?
Who needs two blue suits?
Get me a brown.
A brown suit.
- Is that all?
- That's all. And a blonde.
- You mean a woman?
- You know a blond nurse that's a man?
Big. As big as you can find,
with a big chest.
A 40, a 45. And a nice bottom.
You mean a sexy girl
with a full, round rear end?
Like this. This is too small,
and this is too big.
- Like this is perfect.
- I know what you mean.
If you bring me some pictures,
I'll pick one out.
There are a million girls like that around.
11:15. I've got to go.
Uncle Willy, I'm going.
Mr. Lewis, I can't express to you enough
how happy I am...
and speaking for the millions
of young people in this country...
who never had the opportunity
of seeing Lewis and Clark work...
I just want to say
thank you to both of you.
To the both of you, Uncle Willy.
- I just hope they won't be disappointed.
- They won't.
I know they won't. I'm just saying it.
- Goodbye. I'm going.
- I'll show you to the elevator.
I know where it is.
I'll call you tonight.
I just want to say
that this is a very happy moment for me...
to see you both together again, reunited.
The two kings of comedy.
I'm sure you're both very excited.
It looks like we're off to a great start.
I'll call you later. Goodbye.
Have to slide it.
What do you want? Tea?
Yes, thanks.
- Sugar?
- Lf you got.
I got sugar.
- Would you like a cracker?
- What kind of cracker?
Chocolate, coconut, graham,
whatever you want.
- Maybe just a plain cracker.
- I don't have any plain crackers.
- I got chocolate, coconut, and graham.
- All right, a graham cracker.
- They're in the kitchen in the closet.
- Maybe later.
- I was sorry to hear about Lillian.
- Thank you.
She was a nice woman.
I always liked Lillian.
Thank you.
- And how about you?
- Thank God, knock wood.
Perfect.
I heard different.
I heard your blood didn't circulate.
Not true. My blood circulates.
I'm not saying everywhere,
but it circulates.
I've been lucky. I'm in the pink.
I was looking. For a minute,
I thought you were having a hot flush.
- Want some nuts?
- No, thanks.
Not allowed to eat nuts. Too salty.
- You know, Sol Burton died.
- Go on!
Who's Sol Burton?
You don't remember Sol Burton?
Oh, yes,
the manager of the Belasco Theater.
- That was Sol Bernstein.
- Not Sol Bernstein.
Sol Burton was the manager
of the Belasco Theater.
Sol Bernstein was the manager
of the Belasco Theater...
and it wasn't the Belasco Theater,
it was the Morosco Theater.
Sid Weinstein was the manager
of the Morosco.
Sol Burton was the manager
of the Belasco.
Sol Bernstein,
I don't know who the hell was.
How can you remember anything
if your blood don't circulate?
It circulates in my head.
Doesn't circulate in my feet.
Anything coming down?
Wait a minute. Wasn't Sid Weinstein
that lousy songwriter...
who wrote Lady, lady, be my baby?
No, for Christ's sake, that's Sol Burton!
That Sol Burton. He died?
Last week.
- Where?
- In Variety.
So, this is where you live now?
- Didn't I always live here?
- Not in here. You lived in the big suite.
This is the big suite,
but they cut it up into five small suites.
I have a beautiful room
with my daughter in New Jersey.
- You live in your daughter's room?
- In her house.
I have my own room, my own toilet.
They don't bother me, I don't bother them.
- What is it, in the country?
- Yes, it's in the country.
Where did you think New Jersey was?
In the city?
So, what do you think?
Want to do the doctor sketch?
Listen, it's very good money.
It's only a few days work,
and I can be back in New Jersey.
If you feel you want to do it,
then I'm agreeable.
- And they told you how I feel about it?
- What?
I'm against it. But if you want, I'll do it.
What do you mean, you're against it?
If you're against it, don't do it.
What do you care if I'm against it
as long as we're doing it?
I just want you to know why I'm doing it.
Don't do me any favors.
Who's doing you a favor?
I'm doing my nephew a favor.
It'll be a big break for the kid
to get a couple of big stars like us.
That's different. In that case,
I'm against it, too, but I'll do it.
As long as we understand each other.
I want to be sure you know
that I'm not doing it for the money.
The money goes to my grandchildren.
- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.
But not now. Only if I die.
If I don't die, it'll be for my old age.
- The same with me.
- You haven't got grandchildren.
My nephew's children. Sidney and Mervyn.
Do you want to rehearse
the sketch or not? What?
- You're not against rehearsing?
- I'm against doing the show.
- Rehearsing is important.
- All right, let's rehearse.
Why don't we move the furniture around
and make the set?
Wait a minute.
What the hell are we doing here?
I'm fixing up the set.
I don't know what you're doing.
- You're fixing up the set?
- That's right.
You're fixing up the set
for the doctor sketch?
The doctor sketch?
Wait a minute, god damn it!
We're doing the same damn thing!
Are we fixing up for the doctor sketch,
or are you redecorating my apartment?
I know what I'm doing.
I did this sketch for 43 years.
And what was I doing all that time?
Taking a smoke?
Can we please fix up
for the doctor sketch?
My clothes are beginning to stink
from this apartment.
All right. If you think you know
how to fix it up, you fix it up.
It will be my pleasure.
There. That's the doctor sketch.
For how much?
That's the gypsy-chiropractor sketch.
- You positive?
- I'm more than positive. I'm sure.
All right, wise guy,
show me the doctor sketch.
There. That's the doctor sketch.
You know what you are, Willy?
You're a 73-year-old putz.
Right. Only the putz didn't drive in
all the way from New Jersey.
I didn't drive. My daughter did.
Now can we please rehearse the sketch?
All right. Go outside.
I'm here in the doctor's office.
- Want to do the part with the nurse first?
- Do you see a nurse here?
How can I rehearse
with a nurse that's not here?
Don't ask me. I'm a putz.
Let's forget the nurse.
Start with the part
where I'm in the office and you come in.
All right, I'll start from where I come in.
Knock, knock. I'm looking for the doctor.
First, go outside.
I could be home playing solitaire now.
All right, I'm outside. Knock...
Wait a minute.
You're not outside the door.
- Go out the door!
- We're just rehearsing.
Can't you make believe
that I'm outside the door?
Sure, if you were a better actor.
I'm sorry my daughter
ever bought that car.
We're not going to stop
for every little thing, are we?
I don't know how many years I got left.
I don't want to spend them rehearsing.
We're not going to stop
for the little things.
We're going to stop for the stupid things.
Not going out the door is a stupid thing.
Coming here in the first place
was the stupid thing.
All right, I'm going out.
If I'm outside and my daughter calls,
tell her to pick me up in 20 minutes.
She can pick you up now, for all I care.
- All right, give me a knock, knock, knock.
- Knock, knock, knock.
Don't say it, for God's sake! Do it!
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Give me a knock, knock, knock.
Come in.
- Come in, already.
- It doesn't open. It's stuck.
All right, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
Wait a minute.
- Is it locked?
- It's not locked.
Wait a minute.
It's locked.
Go downstairs and get somebody.
Get the Spanish kid downstairs.
Tell him it's locked.
- What did you say?
- Go down...
and get somebody, for Christ's sake!
Don't you understand English?
Don't you yell at me. I didn't lock the door.
Certainly you locked it!
Why are you wasting time?
Go down and get somebody!
It's open. What's the matter with you?
It's open from my side. You locked yours.
All right, come in, already. Come in.
Did my daughter call?
I think you went a little crazy
in the country.
Do you want to insult me,
or rehearse the sketch?
I would like to do both,
but we ain't got the time.
All right. Forget about the door.
Just stand there and say,
"Knock, knock, knock."
- I hope I can get out again.
- I hope so, too. Knock, knock, knock.
Enter!
What do you mean "enter"?
What happened to "come in"?
It's the same thing, enter or come in.
What's the difference as long as you're in?
The difference is
we've done this sketch 11,000 times...
and you always said "come in."
Suddenly today it's "enter."
Why today, after all these years,
do you suddenly change it to "enter"?
I'm trying to freshen up the act.
Who asked you to freshen up the act?
They asked for the doctor sketch,
didn't they?
The doctor sketch starts with "come in"
and not "enter."
You want to freshen up something?
Put some flowers in here.
What's bad about "enter"
instead of "come in"?
Because it's different.
You know why we've been doing it
the same way for 43 years?
- Because it's good.
- You know why we don't do it anymore?
Because we've been doing it for 43 years.
If we're not doing it anymore,
why are we changing it?
You know what's wrong with you?
You've been sitting on a New Jersey porch
for too long. You're out of touch.
From my window here...
I see everything
that's going on in the world.
Here. I see old people...
I see young people,
nice people, bad people.
I see holdups, I see drug addicts,
ambulances, car crashes...
jumpers from buildings. I see everything.
You see a lawnmower and the milkman.
That's why you want to say "enter"
instead of "come in"?
Are you listening to me?
Why, there's someone else in the room?
You don't know the first thing
that's going on today.
Did you ever hear the expression
"that's where it's at"?
This is where it's at,
and that's where I am!
I see. Did you ever hear the expression:
"You don't know
what you're talking about"?
It comes in front of the other expression:
"You never knew
what you were talking about."
I wasn't the one who retired.
You're the one who retired...
because you were tired,
because you're old-fashioned.
I'm still new-fashioned.
I'm still in demand. I'm still hot!
If this room was on fire,
you wouldn't be hot.
Look, I don't want to argue with you.
After you say "knock, knock, knock,"
I'm gonna say "enter."
If you don't like it,
you don't have to come in.
If you say "enter"
after I say "knock, knock, knock"...
I'm coming in, all right, but not alone.
- I am bringing a lawyer with me.
- From where? From New Jersey?
You're lucky if a cow comes in with you.
Against you in court,
I could win with a cow.
The finger.
You're starting with the finger again.
With a knife? Are you crazy?
Next time you give me the finger,
say goodbye to the finger!
I got a terrific idea.
Instead of working together again,
let's never work together again.
- You're crazy.
- Crazy? I'm crazy?
Keep saying it until you believe it.
