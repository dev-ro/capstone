One by one my hopes vanished,
Into a grave they turned my heart
Destiny made me cry constantly
And then giggled at me
Something happened to the human race,
Miscreants crammed the place
Monstrosity established its own order,
Such is now the world order
They cut them down,
Bumped them off, rubbed them out
They brought them in, tossed them away
They made them burry all
Mixed up,
Now, that's my situation
Mixed up is my destiny,
This world is full with cruelty
Oh my!
Mixed up,
Now, that's my situation
Does this ruthless destiny
Not have a trace of sympathy
Oh my!
Enough of your noise!
You've been going on for ages.
Not a moment's peace!
It's been a full year now.
Are you going to be finished at all?
I'd be lucky to see the day. I'll
probably end up in a hospital by then.
You lazy bums!
All you do is loafing around.
Ali, look son,
don't be stingy with the cement.
You know
what happens with too little cement.
That sand is not from the sea, is it?
Did you check it well? There
shouldn't be any sea shells in it.
Have Sudi check it, too.
Sudi! Sudi!
Where on earth is this guy?
He ran away, didn't he?
He always avoids work.
You do all the work,
I can see that.
I'm going to tell Nizam, I'll ask him
to put a flea in Sudi's ear.
It's not fair to you. I got you! You
are not mixing that sand well enough.
You thought you could run away,
huh, you bum?
What the hell are you doing here?
Hi, Ali.
Drop that, you dumb ass!
Wash your hands. I don't want germs.
Ha, ha, hi Ali, ha, ha!
Ali, don't! Stop it, man! Don't!
Stand still. I'm cleaning you up.
Cut the horseplay.
I've got water in my ear.
I said stop it.
What are you doing down there?
You were supposed to check the sand.
Behave yourself, man.
You guys don't want to learn,
that's for sure.
You're right, ma'am.
What would we do without you?
You're the foreman of our hearts.
Your hearts? How rude!
What did I say, man?
Ali, enough is enough!
Welcome, boss.
Thanks. I brought you tiles.
It's in the trunk.
I'll get them, boss. Sudi.
In the trunk. Ali.
Yes, boss.
These tiles are going to
go on the bathroom walls.
Yes, boss.
Hello. Yes, chief.
Yes, early evening.
Would it be OK if someone else
went instead of me?
No, you got me wrong there.
Of course. Your wish
is my command. Right away.
- Mr. Nizam, my son.
- What the hell are you staring at?
- Mr. Nizam, my son.
- Yes, ma'am?
I told these guys to watch out for sea
shells in that sand since morning...
...but they won't listen.
- What the hell is she saying?
You know,
the sea shells... in the sand?
Sea shells, sea shells!
Yes, ma'am, don't you worry.
I'll teach them a lesson.
Get her off my back. Give her the
damn sea shells.
Ali, is this bigger
than the plan?
No, boss. We've got
two apartments, nice and large.
Yeah, Sudi is right.
There's going to be 3 when we finish
the upper floor. You can keep one.
I've got nothing lost here.
I have a nice house in Bakirk√∂y.
I meant for hard times, you know.
I'm going to sell the lot.
He's got a point, boss.
Nothing like money to tide you over
in hard times.
Yes, Sevket?
Yes, I talked with him.
No, I'm not bus y.
Yes, I'll be there in half an hour.
- What was I saying?
- Money for hard times, boss.
Yeah,
everything seems to be going well.
Oh, here's your weekly pay.
Thanks, boss.
- Take it easy.
- Good bye, boss.
Ali! Sudi!
Ali! Sudi!
Welcome, Nazife.
Sudi, get up. Your
hometown girl is here. Get up.
Welcome, Nazife.
Thanks, Sudi. Here,
I brought you some easter bread.
Welcome, Nazife.
Thanks, Ali. Whew, am I tired!
I made the easter bread for Buse...
...but I couldn't bear the thought
of you missing out on them.
Thanks.
Enjoy.
We got to watch Buse's video clip
the other day.
She looks good.
Not better than you, of course.
You're cute, Sudi.
Did you like the song?
It's great.
What kind of bread
was this?
Easter.
Eastern?
No, Easter, Easter.
What is Easter?
A holiday, a Christian holiday.
How come you know that, Ali?
Ali has been to Europe.
He went to Sweden.
- Is that right, Ali?
- Yeah, I went there to work.
They had Easter holiday s there.
They painted eggs.
What did you do with the eggs?
We ate them.
So, why do they paint them?
Why did you come back?
We got caught as illegal aliens
and they kicked us out.
Aaarghh, it's hot!
Easy, you dumb ass.
My tongue's burning.
Give me some water.
Eat tomatoes.
The water is hotter
than the soup.
Hey Ali, now that we got our weekly
pay, let's go to a Turkish bath?
Get scrubbed clean...
Who's going to mind the site?
The old lady will.
She sure would.
Only thing is,
the boss might get pissed off.
Why would he?
He's a nice guy.
You're right. He trusts us
with everything around here.
He does get mean sometimes.
Yeah, like today.
He was real cross.
You saw it, didn't you?
I sure did. Especially when he was
talking to that guy he called "chief. "
Is Nizam a fisherman?
What's that gotta do with anything?
Well, he kept saying "chief. "
Would a fisherman
have such a car?
Nice car.
How much would it cost?
A lot. A lot of money.
We still got some
eastern pancakes left.
It's not eastern, man.
It's Easter.
Well, whatever.
You want some?
We'd be eating the same chow
each day if it weren't for Nazife.
She's a great girl.
She's probably thinking the same
about you...
...if her cleavage is
anything to judge by.
Cleavage my foot.
She has no money. She puts on
whatever Buse gives to her.
Go on, eat.
Sudi, get up. Get up.
What's going on, Ali?
Get up, Sudi.
Nizam is a murderer.
What are you talking about?
I said get up. Nizam...
he buried some guy in the backyard.
Which guy? Wha...
Ali, you must have had a nightmare.
Nightmare my ass. Get up,
or I'm gonna whack you good.
- Get the shovel.
- OK.
We're going to dig here.
Come on.
Calm down.
- Do you see it?
- See what?
This!
Oh, shit!
What are we going to do now?
We'll get the hell out of here.
We're gonna go up, pick
up our stuff, and get out of here.
No, wait, wait. What are we going to
tell Nizamettin if we run away?
We'll tell him, "Boss, sorry but...
...working for a murderer like you
may be hazardous to our health. "
We won't tell him shit.
He'll sure come after us
if we run away.
Should we
and get burried too?
What if he gets us
framed for murder?
Yeah, you're right.
What are we going to tell the cops?
Shut up, shut up, let me think.
- Ali.
- Huh?
- I've got something to tell you.
- What?
Where did
burry the guy?
Where?
Just where the water tank will go.
Shit. When the tank guy s come and
dig that place they'll find the body.
We're fucked, man.
We're really fucked.
We'll tell them
not to come tomorrow.
How are we going to
find them?
I told that Nizam "Boss, this is not
the right place for the water tank. "
The least he could do was
to bury that stiff a few yards away.
What are we gonna do, then?
We'll move the body.
Something's dropped.
You dropped something.
Pick it up. Come on, pick it up.
Ali, we did the right thing,
didn't we?
I don't know.
Do we have another choice?
We could've at least said a prayer.
You got a point. Let's do it.
You say a prayer.
You know better.
Why me?
Just do it, man.
I ain't no goddamn imam.
You sure know a prayer.
All right, all right.
Allah Allah... Halis.
Halis. He was bald.
And young, too.
What's up, boy s?
You don't look very happ y today.
Ma'am, don't you
have anything better to do?
What a nuisance of a woman!
What do you want from us?
Watch your mouth,
you discourteous bum.
I'm going to tell this Nizam.
Look, I'm sorry, OK?
I didn't mean it that way.
You'll see, you'll see.
What time is it?
I don't know.
What the hell is
keeping those tank guy s?
Yeah,
where are they?
I'm having second thoughts
about what we did.
If only we hadn't meddled in.
Listen, when did these tank guy s say
they'd be here? Oh God!
No way!
I can't put up with this.
Why is it me all the time?
Just as I thought everything's fine,
things get all fucked up.
Am I not ever going to see
anything go right?
- That's life. What can you do?
- Well, fuck this life!
I worked in construction jobs for
4 years a fter I got out of the army.
I saved up some money.
Went back to my village...
...hoping to buy some land and
a few sheep with it.
What a fool I was
for not keeping my self from...
...getting involved in things
that weren't my business.
What's it to you
if some girl le ft home...
...to run away to get married?
Her relatives were going to kill her
so I thought I'd do a good deed...
...by having them kiss and make up.
Wrong! They nearly shot me because
they thought she'd run away with me.
So I ran. Now I'm in the same shit.
You did your duty
as a human.
Bullshit. You can act like a human
but the other person isn't one.
He thinks you're
of his kind - inhuman.
Could've been worse.
Like what?
I don't know, you could be dead.
I'm getting there.
Don't worry, it won't
be long be fore we're in Italy.
Patience.
We're getting out of here tomorrow.
Let's go, Ali, but where?
We'll go to Italy.
But we haven't got enough money yet.
Don't worry. We'll go to Remzi.
He'll find us a job.
He would, wouldn't he?
We'd be better off working on a ship
rather than for some murderer.
Absolutely. My conscience
is troubling me.
The money we earn here will bring us
evil while that guy lies buried.
Let's get out of here tomorrow,
no matter what happens.
Get up, you ass.
What are you up to, bastards?
Where is he? Speak up, where is he?
What did you do with him? Where is he?
Who, boss?
Do you want one in the head?
Where's the corpse?
He should be down in the backyard.
We buried him a few yards away.
So you don't think I'm smart enough
to know where to bury him, huh?
Er, you buried him where they'd put
the water tank so we thought...
You idiots, you need brains to
think with. Did they come?
No.
No?! And why didn't they?
It was me who told them.
They'll put the tank inside.
Who are you to think on my behalf?
I turned my house into a graveyard.
I was going to throw him in the woods
but there was a roadblock.
So I had to turn around and come
back here. Don't stand there! Dig!
What are you looking for, boss?
This is what I'm looking for.
Hello, Sedat, it's me. Tell the chief
the matter's been taken care of.
Yeah, I've got the gun.
I'll bring it over right away.
No problems at all. It's my building,
Sedat. How can I do anything wrong?
Look, what's happened here
has never happened, OK?
Never, boss.
If you blurt out anything,
they'll kill you.
Look, I understand how you feel.
I'm desperate my self.
You think I killed him?
I swear I didn't.
He was my childhood friend.
They set me up.
Here, buy some clothes for yourselves.
No, boss.
Take it.
OK, boss.
Cover him up.
His wallet?
Forget it.
Sudi, we're in this mess
and it's too late to get out.
What I mean is, fuck it, man.
Ali, I can hardly understand you
sometimes. How can you be like this?
Do you see this? We work some more
and we save some more money.
We borrow some more
and we're in Italy.
Can you think of any other way?
Ali, Sudi, isn't anybody here?
Where have you been? I was
worried. I haven't seen you around.
Today's our day off and we thought
we'd get some extra sleep.
Er, I thought I'd drop by
and see if you needed any shopping.
Actually, we were thinking of
doing some shopping, too.
Good, let's go together.
We can't leave the building.
Nobody's going to steal it.
How about Sudi staying?
You go ahead,
Ali. I'll stay here.
See you later.
B ye.
Well, well, well, our Ali seems to be
getting really cosy with that girl.
Thanks.
Sudi, it's a feast, man.
We bought kebab.
I went to the Turkish bath
but you didn't say anything.
I'm happy for you.
It was great.
You should go too. It's in Bakirk√∂y.
- You've been to Bakirk√∂y?
- Yeah.
We didn't know what to do
so we went to Bakirk√∂y.
We had dessert by the sea.
It was fingerlickin' good!
It was wonderful.
- Ali.
- What?
- What are you thinking?
- What Nizam told us.
- Do you think he told the truth?
- What's the difference?
Then he wouldn't be a murderer.
So what? He's an asshole too.
The way he slapped your face...
God sees everything, man.
God will punish him for that slap
when the time comes.
Never mind.
Did you like the food?
The dessert was good.
I wish there was more of it.
All right, then.
Here's real dessert for you.
You can throw away those glamor mags
now that you've got the real stuff.
You bought this
with Nazife by your side?
What are you talking about?
I bought it on the sly, of course.
No offense, man. She ought to be
used to this kind of thing, any way.
Now, that's mean, Sudi.
She's always doing us favors.
That's no way to talk about her.
You're heading for the Turkish bath
first thing tomorrow morning.
Then go shopping, take a stroll,
have fun.
This place is
getting on your nerves,
I'm fed up.
Ali, Sudi.
Who are these guy s?
Ali!
Yes, who are you?
Come downstairs.
We're done for.
We're coming.
Yes, what do you want?
Take a look outside.
- You must be Ali.
- That's right.
- And you Sudi.
- Yeah.
Nobody around, Sevket.
I'm a friend of Nizamettin's,
gentlemen.
I assume
he's mentioned my name.
No, he hasn't.
Then why were you startled
to hear my name?
No, where did you get that idea?
Why should we be startled?
We don't get startled.
I mean, we didn't see anything,
any way.
If we had...
I mean we don't know anything.
Perhaps I was wrong.
Any way... As I told you, gentlemen,
we are Nizamettin's friends.
So we're no strangers.
We've got a little problem...
...and we thought
only you could help us.
After all, we're all friends
of Nizamettin's, aren't we?
All people are the same, really.
I used to know a guy named Cemal.
He had a heart of pure gold.
He was so honest you couldn't believe.
Well, one day Cemal and his wife who
was 5 months pregnant...
...and their child are riding in a
minibus; a drunk driver hits them...
...and sends the minibus
off the road.
The woman and
the child die on the spot.
He stands trial. The driver
is officially declared to be faulty.
His sentence? 3 years.
3 lous y years.
The judge shortens the sentence to
1.5 years because it's first offense.
Any way, this guy gets out
a fter serving only 7 months.
Tea.
Thanks.
After 7 months...
...Cemal finds this guy
and puts 5 bullets in his head.
I'm telling you all this is because
you hear a lot of talk.
Everybody passes judgement.
It's not so simple. It's not eas y
to tell who's guilty and who's not.
You saw nothing,
you heard nothing.
We didn't.
For the tea.
Allright.
What a night!
Who were those guy s?
They had radios and such.
Beats me. We now have 2 dead bodies
in the backy ard instead of one.
I've no idea.
I know one thing: We're done for.
We should've gotten out of here last
night. Why did we wait until morning?
It's fate, man. It's too late now.
Did you notice how they're treating us
like one of their own?
Remember
what that Sevket guy said.
He might be the good guy here.
Sevket is the good guy?
What about the body then?
I guess you're right. If everybody
starts killing each other...
You go ahead and have a good time.
You need anything?
Have a good time and we'll see
what we'll do this evening.
We can go to a movie.
We've got money now.
Shut up. Go now, go.
Where's Sudi off to?
What's all this
leisurely activity about?
You can't finish
this construction in ten years.
Who'll have to put up with the noise?
What are you doing here?
Oh, you gave me such a start.
This is a construction site. The other
day the winch crashed down.
You know, the steel rope broke?
- It's dangerous here.
- I came to talk to you.
- What do you want to talk?
- Well, it's about...
- What?
- About... about Nazife, that widow.
You know, the one
who visits here now and then.
I suspect she fancies one of you.
Can we talk about this
at a more convenient time, ma'am?
You could give me advice.
Of course.
I'm like a mother to you.
I've made many matches,
you know.
Don't you think
it's time you le ft?
Why?
This is a construction site.
It's dangerous.
Dangerous or not, you should be
grate ful for having this job.
There are not many
constructions nowaday s.
- We'll talk later, don't forget.
- Yes, ma'am.
I promise. We'll talk.
We'll see you. Take care.
Hey, watch out. Be care ful.
Wow, you look like Tarkan, man.
How much did you pay for it?
- I got it for 2 million.
- Let me see.
Take it.
2 million.
It's all for Italy, man.
If things keep going like this...
...we can go to Italy
in September.
We'I visit to Remzi next week.
Yeah.
"I cannot call you my lover.
It's a lie,
cross my heart it's a lie...
...believe you me it's a lie... "
You spend the whole day shaving.
"You are my love I am hopelessly
in love with...
my longing for you settles down
in me like billows of smoke...
...it burns in me my love... "
Wow, you sing great, Sudi.
Ali, take this boy to Unkapani.
We don't want his talent wasted.
They'll be happ y
to have him make an album.
Call it "Construction Nightingale. "
On second thought,
crow might be more appropriate.
Hey, Sudi, you make an album
and we'll get a break for sure.
Yeah. Where's Nizam?
He's been gone quite some time.
He hasn't paid our weekly wages,
either.
You're such an ungrate ful bastard.
We've made more money than if we
worked our asses off for a full month.
We're making money without doing
any work, man. Especially you.
Mr Ali, Mr Sudi?
Goodness gracious,
where are they?
Mr Ali?
- Who are you?
- We're from a TV channel.
Now we're fucked.
- Oh, Mr Ali.
- I'm not Ali.
- Excuse me, Mr Ali?
- Yes, that's me. What is it?
Something terrible happened to us
and we don't know what to do.
Calm down, young lady.
Speak slowly.
I'm Sevket's sister-in-law.
Something terrible has happened to us.
I called him, he sent me here say ing
only Ali and Sudi could handle it.
That's Mr Sevket.
We're no strangers, a fter all.
Let's go upstairs.
It's more comfortable up there.
Have a seat. Relax.
Here, a bit too hot but...
- No problem.
- You want some, too?
Calm down. Take it eas y.
Are you all right?
We were going to interview a man...
a coke dealer.
He was going to blow the whistle
on celebrities using coke.
Suddenly a fight broke out.
The son of a bitch pulled out a knife
and attacked Faruk.
I ran to the car.
He came a fter me so
I drove over him.
Oh, it was so terrible.
Don't waste your tears, young lady.
You had no choice.
- Where is he?
- Down there in the trunk.
Ali, this guy's a total mess.
How the hell are we going to
get him out?
How about a wheelbarrow?
Would he fit in?
He might.
What's this?
- Well, his arm came off.
- All right.
- Who put that arm there?
- She did.
No kidding.
Let's get the wheelbarrow.
Ah, Mr Ali, don't you think
it's a bit too cramped in there?
Don't talk like a fool.
What's the difference?
Don't worry, Faruk.
We do this all the time.
Ali.
I mean the digging bit.
Oh, I'm so grate ful for your help.
Here, this is for your assistance.
- No, young lady.
- Please.
All right, then.
Forget about us
and we'll forget about you.
You didn't see us, you didn't hear us.
We've forgotten about you.
OK, OK.
What? See, we've already forgotten.
That's great.
We'll be skilled enough to rival
undertakers.
I hope we don't get cursed.
Ali, look what they le ft behind.
What is it?
- Open it.
- We better not.
- Why not?
- What if it contains the guy's...?
Cut the crap, man. Open it.
It's a camera.
It's a video camera.
Don't mess with it. You'll break it.
Ali, how are we going to give it back?
To whom?
Oh, yeah, we've forgotten,
haven't we?
Give it to me.
Can you make it work?
No, but I know how
we can make it work.
How?
Nazife!
Come over here.
- Nazife.
- Make it quick, I'm late for work.
Nazife,
I'm going to ask you for a favor.
- Go ahead. What is it?
- You see this case?
- What is it?
- A video camera.
Sudi found this
at a bus stop in Topkapi.
It's probably some tourist's.
So he yelled, "Tourist, tourist" a few
times but nobody paid attention.
We don't know
how to make it work...
...but I thought
if you could take it to Buse...
...the clip guy s working with her
might know how.
He found it in a bus stop?
- It was just sitting there?
- Yeah.
Well, I'll take it. I'll ask
the clip guy... to make you happ y.
Thanks, Nazife.
I must hurry. I'm late.
I'll drop by in the evening.
B ye-bye now.
B ye-bye.
This is Akmerkez, the mall
that I've been telling you.
Wow, did you see that, Ali.
That was a good 10 meters.
Just like in America. We've got
great things in this country.
Yeah, as if you know America.
And this is the rewind key.
Look, Sudi,
that guy's running backwards.
- I'm not explaining again.
- Excuse me, what?
If you lose this cable, you won't
be able to watch anything on the TV.
Sudi, don't lose this cable.
- I'm putting it here.
- Nazife, may I shoot?
Go ahead. Err, my new cassette
will be out soon.
I'm also shooting a new TV show.
- And I'm fainting now.
- Wait. Don't faint.
Yes, Mr Sudi,
would you introduce yourself?
No, no, not right now.
Wait a moment. OK, now.
Yes, Mr Sudi.
Yes, now I introduce my self.
I'm Sudi. I'm 29.
I'm a construction worker.
My hobbies include building molds,
plastering, bricklay ing.
And being a dodger.
I have my private jet.
Let me see that footage.
I'll shoot my self too.
Wait, Ali, wait, wait, wait. I got it.
Wow, killer looks.
Just a moment.
Look, I can do it.
Do you see, Nazife?
- Turn it off be fore you break it.
- No, some more.
Turn it off, man.
When you press here,
it turns off. Got it?
- I got it.
- I'm off. I'm very late.
- Turn it off now.
- Wait, Ali, some more.
- I said turn it off.
- Don't break the camera.
B ye-bye.
- B ye-bye.
- B ye-bye, Nazife.
- Ali?
- What?
- Are you shooting me?
- Yeah.
How do I look?
You could make
√ñzcan green with envy.
- Ali, come on, let me look at it.
- What?
- Give it to me.
- Sorry, buddy. You can't have it.
- Aw, come on.
- I'm shooting.
- Come on, stop being a jerk.
- Wait, wait. One moment. Wait.
- What are you doing?
- I got an idea. Wait.
Come. I'll get us
together.
- Are we on now?
- Yeah. Keep still, you klutz.
Ali.
I'll burn you up.
Don't.
Mr Ali, I'm coming.
I'm back.
Welcome back, young lady.
What's up?
I hope I'm not disturbing.
- I thought you'd forgotten us.
- Well, yes, I did, actually.
I came back to see if I'd le ft behind
a small case here the other night.
- A case?
- Yes.
No, we haven't seen any case,
young lady.
- You haven't?
- Nope.
Have a seat. Relax.
Catch your breath.
- Would you like some tea, soda, water?
- No, thanks.
You seem worried
about something.
No, I'm fine. It's just that
I didn't get enough sleep.
Actually, I was ly ing.
I'm not well. I can't sleep.
The moment I close my eyes,
I keep seeing that moment.
I see that man's tongue sticking out
of his mouth when I hit him in my car.
Sometimes I regret what I've done.
You don't know him. For a payment...
...he would give us the names of
celebrities addicted to drugs.
- Who are they?
- What's it to you?
We were talking and he looked at my
case and wanted to know what's in it.
I said, "Nothing. " There was a small
video camera in it.
I showed it to him.
He wanted to grab it.
Suddenly he pulled out a gun.
Faruk tried to stop him.
He attacked Faruk with the gun.
I was a fraid. I ran back to the car.
And when he came a fter me,
I ran over him.
Bastard.
I'm telling you, he was a complete
son of a bitch.
Sometimes I feel glad I ran over him.
People like him
shouldn't have a right to live.
Forget it. What's done is done.
You're right. Well,
I'd better get going. Good night.
Why didn't we give it back?
- Give back what?
- Isn't this the ft?
The ft my ass. The absent-minded bitch
just le ft it behind.
The way she speaks!
"People like this shouldn't have
a right to live. "
Does she think she's Grim Reaper?
This is the kind of person you should
stay away from, the self-righteous.
All right, Ali. She's got
a lot of money. She could buy...
...50 more cameras,
if she wanted to.
She's inventing problems
to pester people with.
She's looking for company.
What the hell is she
talking to me for?
Go talk to your mother. Talk to the
police. Why are you talking to us?
- Ali?
- What?
Wanna watch wrestling match?
OK, let's. You keep your hands
away from it.
It's still running.
Still running.
Come, come.
...suddenly he pulled out a gun.
Faruk tried to stop him.
He attacked Faruk... "
- Ali.
- What?
Why don't we talk to Remzi and have
him fix us a nice place on the ferry?
Remzi'll book us the
first mate's seat for this money.
Here's Mr. Nizamettin.
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, boss.
Boss, we didn't do much work
while you were gone.
We didn't want to do anything
without asking you.
I'll go wash your car, boss.
I don't want to come here at all,
you know.
I want to sell this place
as soon as possible.
Why, boss?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Boss, would you like some tea
when you come out of the bathroom?
Talk and relax, maybe?
All right, you make the tea.
I'll be right back.
That seat is broken, boss. You might
hurt yourself. Come over here.
The tea will be ready in a moment.
The water is so hot that
you don't need to boil it.
Boss, you look worried.
Things are getting out of hand, Ali.
Tell me, boss. What's the matter?
Halis was my childhood friend.
We grew up
in the same neighborhood.
- He alway s looked a fter me.
- Halis... is it him?
Yeah, the guy we buried.
Who was he?
Halis? He was the son of
my boss's enemy.
He messed with my boss a lot.
He ripped him off twice,
took his merchandise.
Then he shot my boss's nephew.
There was a feud.
Then these Sevket guy s
got in the picture.
Ah, we've met them.
Well,
the two sides fought for a while...
...until they realized that
it didn't do any good to either...
...they decided to make peace.
They asked me to be the middleman
since I was Halis's childhood friend.
I met Halis in secret...
...but my boss
and the Sevket guy s...
...had made a plot together.
I had no idea what they were up to.
They shot Halis right there.
What's with this Sevket,
boss?
They wanted tofleece Halis.
But Halis outsmarted them
and got everything on tape.
Then he started threatening them.
These guy s were bent on taking him
out for this reason, any way.
What are you going to do, boss?
Look, Ali.
Sooner or later Halis's friends...
...are going tofind out I was
the last person he was seen with.
But don't worry.
I'm not going to give in.
I've got my plans, too.
I can trust you, right?
Of course, boss.
Ali, take this package.
I want you to give it directly to the
police if anything happens to me.
What's in it, boss?
You'de be better off not knowing.
Don't open it.
All you need to know is, this package
will be the end of my boss and Sevket.
All right, boss, don't you worry.
Well, Ali, that's the way it is.
Oh, boy. Poor Nizamettin.
- Did you hear what he last said?
- What?
Nizamettin doesn't know the
dead man Sevket brought here.
- How do you know?
- I asked him, didn't you hear?
- He didn't know a thing.
- Maybe he was play ing the fool.
- What for?
- How the hell should I know?
How can we be sure it wasn't
Nizamettin who killed that guy?
Besides, why did he give you
that package?
- Shall we take a look inside it?
- I don't think we should.
- Where's that package?
- Here.
Here. But don't open it.
Don't worry, I won't.
I'll hide it in the morning.
Ali, what did you have in mind
when you got Nizamettin on video?
Don't know, I just did it.
- What are you doing there?
- You scared me.
- What's that?
- What's what?
- What's that package?
- It's... it's just a package.
- Sudi!
- Yeah?
You guy s are up to something.
What makes you think that?
Shut up. Don't lie to me.
I know everything.
Those people coming and going...
- Oh, those people...
- Yes.
I'll explain.
- You know Ali?
- Yes?
- You know Ali, right?
- What about him?
- He... err... he's... you know...
- What?
He's a sheikh. He's the grandson
of a sheikh, a very famous sheikh.
Is that so?
Sheikh... Sehabettin.
Sheikh Sehabettin, huh?
Sheikh Sehabettin's grandson.
When
Sheikh Sehabettin passed away...
...his holy aura descended upon Ali.
And he's now preparing talismans
to heal people.
Those people that you saw
coming and going...
They were poor folks
seeking remedy.
I had already understood it.
There was something special
about him.
You're absolutely right, ma'am.
Wow, a sheikh, a sheikh.
Sudi, quick, get over here.
I'm coming, Ali.
Our re frigerator's here.
Thanks, pal.
Eas y, eas y, that's it.
Watch out.
I saw the old lady checking out
the inside of the building.
- You don't say?
- Yes.
I caught her inside.
What will we do about her?
What did she say?
Nothing except
that she saw everything.
What did she see?
She saw all those people coming in.
Shit, man! What are we
going to do about this woman?
- I took care of it.
- How?
Never mind. I can't hold this thing
much longer. Move.
That's it. We'll now have
cold water to drink in the night.
Yeah, you do the wiring.
Ali.
- Do you know the Sheikh Sehabettin?
- Who?
- The Sheikh Sehabettin.
- Who's he?
Your grandfather.
Mr Ali, my son, you know I have
a daughter living in Antaly a.
She's married to
some pitiful zurna player.
He thinks himself a maestro
but that's another matter.
Ah, Mr Ali, my son, this creep hasn't
touched my daughter in 2 years.
He's probably under some evil spell.
He's totally lost his manhood.
They are about to get divorced.
Show your greatness, Ali, my son.
Let's save this marriage.
We'll give you an amulet for her.
Give it to her.
Thank you.
But, ma'am,
your daughter must do her part, too.
Like what?
You know, emphasize her femininity,
flirt with her husband a little...
She can do those things all right.
She's very resource ful.
Thank you so much, Mr Ali, my son.
What's that?
Er... well...
No, ma'am, put it back.
You don't have to...
No way! Take it, my son.
And God bless you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Why did you take that bracelet?
That's the way things work.
We don't want to arouse her suspicion
by refusing payment, do we?
Ali! Sudi!
Come in.
What can we do for you?
We like Nizamettin very much.
He's our uncle's driver but...
...we have great respect for him.
So we don't want him to hear
about this. You understand?
Nizamettin is oblivious to the world,
any way.
You see? What did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you nobody would notice?
Sedat, who told you to bring it here?
Halis did, my friend. Halis did.
What is it? Is there a problem?
No, no problem.
I'll make some tea.
You do drink tea, don't you?
I don't drink tea. Do you have soda
water? We could send for some.
We do, we do. Don't trouble yourself.
