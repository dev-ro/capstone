- Hi.
- Hey, how you doin' there?
Slam the door, it won't shut.
- Yeah, right, right.
(crashing)
Eh.
(engine rumbling)
(soldiers whooping)
- [Bird] Uh oh, uh oh.
- [Bird] Here we go.
Here we go again.
(chattering)
- [Man] (mumbling) where's my beer uh?
(chuckling)
- Hey Maria.
(mumbling)
- [Maria] Here's the wine.
- Uh huh, put him down, now.
That's it, go on.
- Come on Sarge.
- Hold it.
- Get him.
- Hold on.
- Oh it's really bad, we're in trouble.
- Cheers.
- There you go.
You're ready, he's on your side.
- Get him, get him.
Come on, push it.
- Yeah, go on.
Watch him go.
- Come on Sarge, come on.
You got it now, Sarge.
Come on, that's the way to do it, come on.
(chattering)
(cheering)
(squawking)
- [Soldier] I bet him hundred
he'd do it in ten minutes.
- [Soldier] That's right, me too.
Now you got it, take
it easy, take it easy.
- [Soldier] What about me, Sarge?
(mumbling) for everybody, right Sarge?
Huh, right?
- Yeah, whatever you like.
(chattering)
(chuckling)
- Hey what do you want mate?
- An omelet, please.
- One or two eggs?
- 12.
- 12?
- Yeah.
- You want it with onions?
- No, it's too heavy.
- Yoo hoo!
Our new champion!
(cheering)
- Wow! Wow!
(mumbling)
- [Soldier] Hey, it's Sergeant Cameron
from San Antonio, Texas.
- [Soldier] San Antonio, pray for us.
(chattering)
- Did you order the omelet?
- [Bulldozer] Huh?
Ooh.
- There you are.
- Mmm.
- Double your money.
Step right up.
This card loses, this one
too, but the ace wins.
Okay, here we go, ace wins.
Keep your eye on the card,
'cause the hand is quicker than the eye.
Ready?
(chattering)
Where's the ace?
Where'd it go?
Could be here, you never know.
Place your bets.
- [Soldier] You know
what I think about you?
(chattering)
- [Spitz] (mumbling) another ten for you,
and here's the ace, you lose.
(cawing)
Wanna try boys?
You never can tell.
(chattering)
- [Spitz] (mumbling) place your
bets, that's $20 (mumbling).
Okay, place your bet.
(mumbling) bettin' against the Sergeant?
- Aw, come on, Pa, relax.
Don't worry.
There's no way the
American can win this time.
- You've said that every time so far.
- Aw, but this time
it's a sure thing, Pop,
like candy from a baby.
- Yeah, but the Sergeant is no baby.
- You'll regret it.
(chattering)
- Aw, come on, Sarge.
I ain't bettin' on nobody's arm.
- Come on.
(whooshing)
- Come on, Telestino, he's all yours.
- [Man] Push that guy out.
(chattering)
- [Soldier] Show him your manhood, Sarge.
- You got him straighter, man.
(whooshing)
- [Gigo] That's my boy, just watch him go.
(cracking)
(yipping)
- [Gigo] What's the matter?
- [Soldier] You a wise guy?
- No, I'm, I'm hurt.
- [Man] Hey Gigo, look at Telestino!
What?
Over here, over here!
(excited mumbling)
- He's gonna take him down now, watch.
(chattering)
(grunting)
(crashing)
(whooping)
(bird yipping)
- Go, get him
(chattering)
- Kevin, break his arm, the dago.
(whooshing)
(whooshing)
Why, I saw ya this time.
- Ooh.
(cracking)
(laughing)
(cracking)
(yipping)
- [Soldier] Go on, Sarge.
Make him say uncle.
Make him say mother.
(mumbling)
- [Man] Shut up, boy, let the Sergeant--
(chattering)
Will you shut up?
- [Man] Telestino, Telestino.
- Pressure.
- Go.
(chattering)
(cheering)
- [Soldier] Look at all that money!
- Hold it!
This is a stick up!
- What is it?
- I said it's a stick up.
- Relax, don't get so hot about it.
- I want the money,
move it, all you've got.
- Hey, take it easy with that Howitzer,
it's not good to fiddle with.
It's got a trigger that's sensitive.
Take your finger off it.
That's better.
- Hold it, what are you doing?
- You wanted my money, didn't you?
- Alright, flip it.
The other pocket.
(clattering)
- [Bulldozer] There you go.
- That's all?
- Well, you know how it is.
I'm just a sailor.
- Your watch.
Throw it.
- Go down.
Warm, warm.
You're getting a little
hotter, hotter, hotter.
Okay.
(sirens blaring)
Eh?
- The chain around your neck.
- No, I can't give you this.
- [Jerry] Hand it over.
- The chain, no, my friend.
(thudding)
(sirens blaring)
(chattering)
- Hold, hold.
That's it, champ, hold.
You stop and see, come on.
(cheering)
- There you go, Sarge, count it.
That there's 500.
There you go, take it easy, relax.
Relax.
- Can I try with you?
- Huh?
Yeah.
Wanna double the stakes?
- Okay, double.
- Hey boys, let's hear
it for the new champion.
- [All] Hip hip hooray.
- Come on, we gotta root for
the guy, for our new champion.
(cheering)
- Go on.
(smacking)
Okay, goombah, put your
money where your mouth is.
- Yeah.
Can you match this?
It's gold.
- [Sarge] Yeah, let's see.
Mmm.
Hold this.
- This is Swiss.
Solid gold.
- [Sarge] Okay.
(chattering)
(snapping)
(laughing)
- [Bulldozer] What's
that supposed to mean?
(thudding)
(cracking)
(smacking)
- [Man] Here, go now.
(chattering)
- Hey Sarge.
Rest up, hold it.
Get down there.
Yeah, keep going.
Put the pressure on, put the pressure on.
- Hold, hold.
- Come on, Sarge, put him down.
(excited chattering)
Go, Sarge.
- Go, Sarge.
- Yeah, come on, come on.
- [Man] Oh no, no, please, look out.
(cheering)
- Yeah!
He's gettin' tired.
- You got it, come on.
Put the pressure on.
(mumbling)
- No! No!
- Get him Sarge, get him now, get him now.
- Hang on, black beard, hang on.
- Yeah.
(exciting chattering)
You got it.
Kill him black beard.
- Oh yeah, yay, oh!
- (mumbling) come on, that's the way.
Come on, come on.
- He's gaining.
- [Man] Oh yeah, please.
(crashing)
(cheering)
- That's not fair!
The table broke!
Baloney!
I felt the table move!
(thudding)
(arguing)
Bunch of lying cheats!
(thudding)
(uptempo music)
(crashing)
(grunting)
- No habla you paisan!
(whimpering)
(thudding)
(crashing)
(excited chattering)
- [Bird] Get the door.
Get the door.
(squeaking)
- The door, there's a draft!
There's a draft!
Wah!
(engines grumbling)
- [Soldier] Alright, Private,
let's get outta here.
(clattering)
(whistling)
- Hey, what are you doin' there?
(laughing)
What's going on here?
Who's the wise guy?
I'll murder the idiot.
(chanting)
- [Man On Loudspeaker]
Company B, obstacle course.
(whistling)
Camp Durban football team at
Bradley Field for practice.
(slapping)
(clapping)
(grunting)
(mumbling)
(whistling)
- Get the lead out.
- Set, hut one, hut two.
(thudding)
- Come on, men.
Move it!
- Down sir!
(grunting)
- [Player] Down sir!
- [Player] Down sir!
(grunting)
- We'll (mumbling) I said move it.
(yelling)
(grunting)
- [Player] Set, hut.
(thudding)
Set, hut.
Set, hut.
Set, hut.
Great.
(whistling)
- [Player] Are you ready?
- [All] Yeah!
- [Player] Are you ready?
- [All] Yeah!
- [Player] Begin, hut, hut, hut, hut.
- The motorpool?
- [Soldier] Down there.
- Thanks.
(chanting)
(engine rumbling)
- Do you know what my
worst defect is, Sergeant?
- Superior officers
don't have defects, sir.
- I like to listen to little birds.
- Oh, that's very interesting sir.
- It is, Sergeant, it is,
and especially the conversation I had
with that little bird this morning.
Apparently last night
another bar was destroyed.
Is that true?
Your men take these things too lightly.
(whistle blowing)
- Too light, dig in more.
If I were you sir, I wouldn't listen
to the gossip of little birds.
- And if i were you, Sergeant, I would
concentrate on coaching so that this team
becomes a winning one.
If you insist on going
around picking fights,
it's gonna cost you
dearly one of these days.
You follow my drift, Sarge?
- I do.
- [Colonel] Do what?
- I follow you.
- [Colonel] I follow you, sir.
- I follow you, sir.
(players chattering)
(engine rumbling)
- Are you Monkeywrench?
- Yeah.
- I'm looking for an injector, a Thompson.
- Huh?
You mean you've got a caterpillar?
- No, it's for my boat.
- Huh.
And how is it you're putting on a boat
what you're supposed
to put on caterpillar?
- A caterpillar is a little bit different
from a boat, I mean--
- There ain't no bad boy
here that's gonna squeal.
I mean, to me it makes no difference,
so long as you pay, I'll get
anything you want for ya.
I'll tell ya what I'll do.
Look, wanna go 'round
with a 1936 Tommy gun
to put on top of your caterpillar, huh?
- A '36 Tommy gun?
- Yeah.
- No.
I want to make an old motor new.
- [Player] Huh, set, 22, 18 hut.
- [Sarge] Yeah, alright, hold it.
- [Player] What's the matter?
- Hey.
(thudding)
(laughing)
(clapping)
- [Player] It's a football, paisano.
(chattering)
- That ain't no souvenir,
so throw it back, Popeye.
Or didn't ya eat your spinach today?
(laughing)
(whooshing)
(thudding)
(laughing)
- [Man] Did you see that?
- [Man] Yeah.
- [Player] You alright, Sarge?
- Yeah, yeah.
Get it.
Alright, now let's see ya throw it back.
(booming)
(swooshing)
(melancholy music)
(whistling)
(chattering)
(laughing)
- Hey, those little (mumbling).
- Get me that ball.
- [Player] That's our ball.
- Get that friggin' ball back here.
- [Man] Come and get it!
(horn bellowing)
- Oh.
(gulls cawing)
- No, no way.
- Why not?
A chance like this comes
once in a lifetime.
- What chance?
- That someone like you should turn up.
- So, I'm your idea of a chance, huh?
- You're darn right.
You beat him at arm wrestling.
You could really teach him a lesson.
- I teach minding my own business.
I don't give lessons.
- Hey, paisan.
This is really beautiful.
Where'd you find it?
You collect shells?
- I don't, but others do, thank God.
- How much is it worth?
- A lot.
So make sure you don't break it.
- Oh, you kidding?
This is a collector's item.
I'm just holding it.
This a rarest piece--
(clattering)
- It was.
- [Gigo] I'm sorry, paisan, it broke.
- [Bulldozer] Yeah, yeah,
let's think about eating.
Paella, Bask style.
- You idiot.
- I couldn't ah!
Coulda happened to anybody.
Cream sauce, here.
- So, where was I?
Cream, butter and flour.
A little spicy is better.
- We had some pretty good deals going
before Sergeant Kemper showed up.
- Is it really necessary that you pick on
the United States Army?
- What do you mean?
We gotta defend ourselves, don't we?
- [Bulldozer] Against the Army?
- Yeah, ever since Kemper got here
we can't black market anything.
He wants to handle it all himself.
American soldiers used to sell us things
but not anymore.
- Don't you have anything
better to do, huh?
- There's no merchandise.
The town's dead.
- Sprinkle generously with light cream.
Huh, the only thing I can do
is invite you to dinner, boys.
Mmm.
Forget it, I can't even do that.
(splashing)
(cawing)
(blades whirring)
- [Player] Ha!
(whistle blowing)
- [Player] Ha!
(whistle blowing)
- [Player] Hey!
Ha!
(crashing)
Sarge, my glasses broke.
- Keep your mind on what you're doing.
(melancholy music)
(chanting)
(whistling)
- [Soldier] That's the
Navy hymn you're whistling.
- So?
Here we are.
I told ya I'd find a piece, that Thompson
for your caterpillar, okay?
- Yeah, but it's for a boat, like I said.
- Yeah, what if somebody
inspects your boat below
and comes up with a caterpillar, huh?
- Then I'd be stuck.
(laughing)
What do I owe you for the injector?
- Eh, well--
(clanking)
- Put that down.
(whistling)
Where were you Wednesday,
October 23rd, 1973?
- It was a Thursday.
- How come you're so sure about that?
- 'Cause it was my cat's birthday, meow.
- Listen, you ain't foolin' me.
There are only three people alive
who can score from 72
yards the way you did.
- I was lucky.
I had the wind on my side.
- Huh, it was a hurricane.
It was Bill Simmons, only he's locked up
now in Sing Sing, and Nat Chienski.
Poor guy ended up in a wheelchair.
But uh, the third one was
called Bulldozer, right?
Ever hear of him?
Bulldozer disappeared
from the scene halfway
through the game between
Minnesota and Philadelphia,
on October 23rd, 1973.
- That's right and since then
Bulldozer hasn't existed.
- Hmm, and how do you know that?
- Oh, I read the newspapers.
- Yeah.
But the papers didn't
print why you retired.
You're yellow, Bulldozer.
That's the reason why.
Because you turned chicken.
You were scared of the
game, of getting hit.
- Well, you can think what you want.
As far as I'm concerned, it's finished.
Now listen, how 'bout this
Thompson fuel injector?
How much do you want?
- Nothing Bulldozer.
I don't want anything from you.
'Cause you're not gonna get this piece
and I'll tell ya why.
The day that you walked off the field,
I bet everything of what I
had on your lousy team to win
and thanks to you, I lost,
and since that day I've
had nothing but troubles.
I still don't know how
come you turned up here
but if you're expecting
me to give you this piece,
so as you can leave again, forget it!
You understand!
Forget it!
(clattering)
- [Man On Loudspeaker] The
bus for the guided tour
of Etruscan Metropolis is
loading at the main gate.
Civilian personnel must show their papers
for educational program--
- Who said that?
- I didn't say it, Bulldozer did.
- Your guys against us?
- Yeah, in a free-for-all so
pick the best men you got.
We don't want any excuses.
This way we'll settle the
score once and for all.
- Tonight?
- You're on.
- [Man On Loudspeaker] The
bus for the guided tour
of Etruscan Metropolis is
loading at the main gate.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
- [Man On Loudspeaker] For
educational program (mumbling).
(chuckling)
- Attention!
I want ten men.
Arkov.
- Hep.
- [Sarge] Collins.
- Aye, sir.
- [Sarge] Simpleton.
- Here, Sergeant.
- Not you, creep, your brother.
- [Simpleton] Over here, Sergeant.
(horn honking)
- Kemper.
- [Sarge] Sir.
- Do you know your
Colonel is a connoisseur
of Etruscan tombs?
One of my worst defects.
You coming on the tour?
- Certainly, sir.
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
- [Colonel] Excellent.
- Get aboard men.
- Alright, go ahead.
(engine rumbling)
- Now.
(mellow music)
(bell chinging)
- [Tony] Let's go.
- [Gigo] Hey Tony.
- [Tony] What?
- [Gigo] Are you sure he's gonna show up?
- [Tony] Don't worry.
I told him we found a
Thompson fuel injector.
- [Gigo] Yeah, but it's almost 10 o'clock.
- [Tony] Almost 10 o'clock.
- He's coming up.
Turn the sign, quick.
We'll teach him a lesson.
(chuckling)
(mellow music)
Get down!
Hurry up before they catch on.
Ooh, come on.
- It's never steady.
It's either too much, or too little.
You never know.
If this keeps up, no one's
gonna make a cent tonight.
And when the place is packed, they manage
to break up the place somehow.
You won't believe me, but
since I opened this joint,
I had to rebuild it four times.
So, thank God nobody broke
that yet, the mirror, yeah.
(crashing)
- [Bird] Oh boy!
Oh boy!
- Well, Popeye, where are the others?
- Well, my mother's in California
and who knows where my father is.
- You're a regular
little joker, aren't you?
First you come looking for me,
now you're trying to back down.
You playin' chicken again, Bulldozer?
- Yeah, first, no one looked for you.
Second, I'm not backing down and third,
I don't like to eat an
omelet with sugar on it.
- [Bird] With sugar on it!
With sugar on it!
(Bulldozer humming)
(thudding)
(groaning)
(clanking)
- [Soldier] Put up your dukes!
- [Bulldozer] Duke, duke.
- Not bad for an old man.
(chuckling)
- And three dukes.
(thudding)
(grunting)
Ah!
- Ah!
- Yah!
Argh!
(thudding)
- Do your penance now.
- How Father?
- Like this.
(laughing)
(thudding)
- Who's there?
(squawking)
(crashing)
(thudding)
(grunting)
- [Soldier] I got him.
- [Soldier] Hold on, that's good.
- [Soldier] Good, huh?
- [Soldier] This is better and (mumbling).
(chuckling)
- [Soldier] Ah, shut up.
- [Soldier] Bring him in.
(mumbling)
- What's he gonna do?
(thudding)
(grunting)
(crashing)
- Oh!
- He's a one man army.
What like (mumbling) of these.
- Get up, boys.
Don't worry about anything, huh, okay?
(slapping)
(grunting)
(thudding)
(crashing)
- Wow, wine.
(cracking)
- [Bulldozer] Get outta here.
(laughing)
- Hey!
- [Bulldozer] Look out!
(thudding)
(grunting)
(chuckling)
Get up.
(thudding)
(groaning)
(squawking)
What's wrong?
Try this.
(sputtering)
(squawking)
What's the matter with you?
Shut up.
(thudding)
(uptempo music)
(yelling)
(cracking)
Haven't you had enough?
Here, drink up.
Good boy.
(laughing)
(groaning)
(sirens blaring)
- Hey, it's the MP's.
Get going, get going.
And tell your father to back us up, huh?
- Hey.
- [Soldier] Why you...
(thudding)
- Bullseye, okay.
(thudding)
(groaning)
(laughing)
(smacking)
(mumbling)
- What's all this silly business?
- Well, we wanted to give you a hand.
- Yeah, and I'm gonna give it back.
- Oh, very good.
(thudding)
(grunting)
Let 'er rip.
(crashing)
(whistles blowing)
- [Bird] Uh oh, uh oh.
(whistles blowing)
("Anchors Aweigh")
- You know what my
worst defect is, Kemper?
- If I answer that sir,
I'll probably end up
facing a firing squad.
- I believe in horoscopes.
- That's interesting, sir.
Tell me about the stars, sir.
- You see, Kemper, I'm a
Capricorn and you're a Taurus
and the two don't get along,
and the present conjunction
between Saturn and Neptune
suggests that I send your
little troop of heavies
deep into the deserts of New Mexico,
where it's 90 in the
shade, where it's cooler.
- You're not the type to accept advice
from Saturn, are you sir?
- That depends.
In this moment, Neptune says that after
this obstacle course, a
little stroll in the marshes
with the leeches and
water moccasins wouldn't
hurt you in the least.
- You know what my worst defect is?
(laughing)
I'm vindictive.
- Yeah, I get you, Sarge.
You're gonna risk gettin'
shipped out to New Mexico
for the satisfaction of
beatin' those clowns to a pulp.
- Yeah, I'm with ya.
When I'm finished with
those paisans, the desert
in New Mexico is gonna feel
like a Florida vacation.
- [All] Yeah.
(laughing)
- I said I'm vindictive, not an idiot,
but I still wanna bust 'em good, right.
They're gonna be hit so hard,
they'll have to part their
toes to brush their teeth.
They won't forget it as long as they live.
- Yeah, we'll open up an ice
cream parlor in the desert.
- Don't worry, we're gonna do it,
in front of a cheering crowd
and with the Colonel's blessings, too.
We'll challenge 'em to a game of football.
A sporting confrontation,
played by the book,
good clean game, but not lacking
in a certain semi-toughness.
The whole bit, umpires,
cheerleaders, high-ranking officers
and us bashing their heads
in like they was watermelons.
(laughing)
- Yeah, but how you gonna
get 'em to go for it?
They'll never fall in a trap like that.
- Don't worry, we got a
little ace up our sleeve
that'll make 'em fall, you'll see.
- You're gonna need more than an ace.
- You wanna bet?
(clanking)
- Ooph!
(moaning)
- Good morning.
- [Bulldozer] Morning.
- [Soldier] What was in there, lead?
(chuckling)
(chattering)
(uptempo playful music)
- Don't say no.
Just look what a team we got.
You can't say no.
It's too late now.
- Too late for what?
- To turn back.
- Yeah, we can't have 'em
push us around all the time.
- Anyway, we already accepted
the deal they put to us.
- Huh, oh no.
- They challenged us to a real game.
And the bet's really fair.
One touchdown and the game's finished.
For those goons, it's finished.
All we gotta make is one touchdown to win.
- They really said that?
- Yeah, they sure did.
- And you accepted huh?
- They don't scare us.
- Listen, what do we need to
become a real football team?
- To begin with, you kids
haven't got the build
or the stamina and there
aren't enough of you, anyway.
- Don't worry about that.
We've got reinforcements coming.
- We only gotta score one touchdown.
That was the bet we made.
- Mmm, no, you'll never make it.
- That only depends on you.
- On me?
What can I do?
- Are you Bulldozer, or aren't you?
- Right.
The man that took a third-rate team
from nowhere all the
way to the championship.
- If you can teach us how, Bulldozer,
they can't stop us.
- Yeah, Bulldozer, you can't say no.
(melancholy music)
- Listen boys.
Don't count on me.
I found that spare part.
They're going to deliver
it and install it today,
and I leave tomorrow morning.
Good luck.
(melancholy music)
(horn bellowing)
(clanking)
- Beautiful, eh?
Finally managed to find a
Thompson fuel injector for you.
- You're not saying that
that's a Thompson, are you?
- Well, I'm not saying it's exactly.
It's not exactly a Thompson, but it's--
- Yeah, and it's not exactly
a fuel injector, either.
- Well, the, it isn't a fuel injector,
but with some adjusting, (mumbling)
with a little work, you
can do something with it.
- Yeah, with a little work you can make
a rocking horse out of it, huh?
(clicking)
Like so.
- Oh, no.
It will be a fuel
injector when I modify it.
- Okay.
While you're trying to modify it,
I'll go look for an injector.
(whirring)
(horn bellowing)
(mumbling)
- I'll beat it out of you.
(thudding)
(breathing heavily)
Where you going, huh?
Huh?
(groaning)
Turn around.
Where's the wad?
I got it, I got it.
- Ah!
(thudding)
(thudding)
(grunting)
You dirty, I'll kill ya.
(grunting)
- [Bulldozer] How's the air up there, huh?
- Let me down.
(thudding)
(grunting)
(clanging)
(gasping)
(whooshing)
(thudding)
(clanging)
Why you--
- No, hold it, here.
It's yours.
- Oh, thanks.
(thudding)
(grunting)
- [Alberto] You only went
in there 'cause it was dark.
But I'll get you yet.
(groaning)
- You feel any better?
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.
I'll be leaving tomorrow.
- [Bulldozer] There's no hurry, you know.
- I just don't want my
folks to see me like this.
Listen, Bulldozer, they
picked on the wrong guy.
- [Bulldozer] Oh yeah?
- I didn't do anything
to those lousy freaks.
You gotta believe me.
- Relax.
Why give me an explanation
when I didn't ask for one?
- Well, let me ask you a question.
- [Bulldozer] Go ahead.
- Why'd you say no to us?
- 'Cause you haven't a
chance against the G.I.'s.
That kind of football
was invented in America.
- Is that the only reason for saying no?
There's nothing wrong with losing a game.
What's the real reason?
- Hey, wait a minute.
I don't remember asking you
any questions, so why ask me?
- I think we'd be a lot better off
if we started asking questions.
Why don't you coach us?
Bulldozer.
(melancholy music)
- You see this?
I swore on this medal
I'd never play again.
- [Spitz] You just gotta coach
the team, not play on it.
- It's like smoking.
You say I'm gonna give it
up but before you know it,
you've smoked a whole pack.
- So you kicked the habit and got the game
out of your system?
- Yeah.
You want to know why I quit, huh?
They said I was chicken and that I was
scared of getting hurt
in a game and ran away.
Ah, they said so many things.
I left football when I found out
that certain games were being fixed.
Yeah, I got a bad habit.
It's a vice, it's stronger
than just smoking.
I believe in honest sport
and I don't like cheating.
That's the truth.
- You know what I told you before
about how they picked on the wrong guy?
Well, it's not true, none of it.
I owed a lot of bread, a lot of money
to the boss of a small gambling joint.
That's why I got pasted.
- There's always something new to learn.
I thought it was you
that was in the right.
- You know, I used to go in for sports.
But when you gotta get
up and dawn and train
and you don't know if what you're doing
is the right thing,
it's no fun, believe me.
And that's the reason we asked you.
And that's the reason why
I decided to come here,
to bother you 'til you accept.
(engine rumbling)
- Hey.
- Well, it's not a
Thompson and it's not even
a fuel injector, but you
can't listen to manufacturers.
They always want things their own way.
(engine sputtering)
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, go baby, come on, go, go.
Oh, oh, oh, ha ha!
- She heard you.
- Yeah, she heard her master's voice.
- [Old Man] Nice sound, huh?
- [Bulldozer] Beautiful, beautiful.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
- [Bulldozer] Thanks to you.
- So that's it.
You've got the motor working,
and you'll be leaving tomorrow, hmm?
Well then, all I can do
is wish you good luck,
even if your going away is gonna mean
us forfeiting the game.
(mellow music)
- Ah!
(splashing)
(laughing)
- [Man] Rise and shine Gigo.
- Ah!
(mumbling)
Come on.
♪ See him once again ♪
♪ Yeah ♪
♪ Where's he coming from ♪
♪ No one knows (mumbling) ♪
♪ No one knows (mumbling) ♪
- [Man] Hey, fall in.
(mellow music)
♪ You can see a mountain ♪
Coming?
- Yeah.
♪ You can see a cloud of mist and dust ♪
- [Man] Move it, move it, move it.
♪ He won't be the first
one to love the glory ♪
♪ (mumbling) won't deny ♪
♪ Ah ♪
♪ Where's he coming from ♪
(yipping)
- [Man] Let's go.
♪ No one knows (mumbling) ♪
♪ No one know (mumbling) ♪
(breathing heavily)
- And so you wanna play
a game of football, huh?
Well, it sounds like you got asthma.
- [Man] Gotta get into shape yet.
After all, just started.
- Jump, jump, come on.
Loosen up a little.
You couldn't play one minute.
- You're exaggerating coach,
'cause there's nothing
to stop us from getting better.
Ah!
(laughing)
- Shut up!
No more smoking, no more alcohol,
and everybody gets up
nice and early at dawn.
- [Man] Yeah, I knew it.
- [Man] At dawn?
- [Man] What about women?
- [Man] Yeah.
- I didn't tell you to play
the game against these odds.
- [Man] Gee, no cigarettes or nothin'.
- [Man] Ridiculous.
- Meanwhile, you won't need this.
(chattering)
- You're not even gonna let us play?
- Listen, I want to help you.
Not just to play, but to win.
When's the game?
- In 20 days.
- They're going to be 20 rough days.
Days you're gonna
remember for a long time.
I know I may lose,
but we'll give 'em a game,
a game they'll never forget.
Ready, in place.
(whistle blowing)
(all chanting)
Who's gonna win?
- [All] We are!
- [Bulldozer] Who's gonna lose?
- [All] They are.
- Who's gonna give it?
- [All] We are.
- Who's gonna get it?
- [All] They are.
- Who's gonna like it?
- [All] We are.
- [Bulldozer] Who's gonna hate it?
- [All] They are.
- Who's gonna love it?
- [All] We are!
- And who's the boss?
- [All] You!
(whistle blowing)
(mellow music)
(chattering)
(chanting)
(chattering)
(whistle blowing)
(mellow music)
(whistle blowing)
(groaning)
(breathing heavily)
- [Man] I want a touchdown.
There's a lot of touchdowns.
(groaning)
- I was taking a look at the rules.
- Forget 'em.
We're gonna start from scratch.
To play football you
need two basic things:
agility and stamina.
Stamina comes by training long.
You'll learn everything on stamina.
- How do we learn to be agile?
- You don't.
You got to be born that way.
Now, we've been at it for two hours.
It's enough.
- [Man] That's good, my
stamina was running--
- [Man] Yeah, mine too.
- Do any of you clowns know who accepts
stolen goods around here?
(mellow music)
- [Barber] What'll it be?
Shave or a haircut?
Make up your mind.
- Esvaldo.
- Is that a new style?
- Go get him.
- I don't know anybody called Esvaldo.
Listen, buddy, you're
talking to a killer here,
not a blabbermouth, so what'll it be?
Make up your mind.
- Shave my beard, please.
- Heh.
(mellow music)
(thudding)
(grunting)
You open that door, you
go down a couple of steps
and you turn to your left.
Go down the hall, it's the
last door on your right.
- You're a man of few words.
I like that.
- Why don't you be a
nice guy and get me down?
I can't stand heights.
Thanks.
(thudding)
The heights were better,
the heights were better.
- Where do you think you're headed?
- To see Esvaldo.
- There's no way you can see him, mac.
- No, no, there's a way, there's a way.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
(thudding)
- Esvaldo.
- [Esvaldo] What is it?
What happened?
- There's somebody to see ya.
- [Man] Yeah, a trolley car.
- [Esvaldo] How did you get in here?
- I'm your buddy.
- Well, I'm glad that you're a buddy.
- It's got a lot of rubies,
Swiss, what a beauty, huh?
Double-casing, gold-plated--
- Sure, sure that figures.
Double-casing, gold-plated.
For the love of pete, you
mean there's (mumbling)?
- You mean you let
somebody get away with it?
- No, a little wise guy.
He come in here with a bunch of filigree
and a sled timer, but he's a shrewdie.
He'll dodge you every time.
He runs like a deer.
There's no catching him.
- That's my boy, right on the head.
(uptempo music)
(mumbling)
(chattering)
- [Man] Came in 20 to one.
- [Man] Well, you gotta
figure he's been losing
for a month straight.
I mean, the odds can't go down.
I gotta meet that attendant.
- [Man] You're telling me.
It always happens that way.
200 thousand lira--
- [Man] You know, you
shoulda tried a parlez--
- (mumbling) give me that money.
- I barely got the dough and then
have to cough it up already.
(thudding)
- [Bulldozer] Give me that gun.
- [Jerry] Hey, what are you doin', huh?
- [Bulldozer] Gimme the guy's wallet.
- [Jerry] What?
- [Bulldozer] Check if
there's anything missing.
- Boy, you can't say the police don't
work fast in this town.
(thudding)
- [Bulldozer] Come here.
- What else do you want?
Yow!
(uptempo music)
That's it?
That's all I gotta do?
- More or less.
- Well, it's not too bad.
I could really get into this thing.
- Mmm hmm, what did I tell you?
- Okay, I'm in.
Do I get any free time?
You know, to keep me in business?
- I'll think about it.
- Great.
(mellow music)
- Alright boys.
Move it, move it, move it.
Keep it going.
(grunting)
(thudding)
Try you're lost.
Roll it.
(groaning)
- [Man] Easy, you'll be alright.
- [Man] I'm a tough customer.
- [Man] I'm a tough customer.
- [Man] I'm a tough customer.
- [Gigo] I'm a tough--
Ooh!
(moaning)
- [Man] He's tough.
(chanting)
- Up.
Hold up.
Hold up.
- [Man] Watch where you're going, will ya?
- Set.
Ready.
(horn honking)
- [Man] It's the G.I.'s.
(laughing)
(chattering)
- Hey, hey.
That new kid ain't bad.
Nice reflexes.
You're really doin' great.
Yeah, there's no doubt
they're sure to learn
from an old fox like Bulldozer.
We expected to see a bunch of softies.
So much the better, actually.
I mean this match otherwise
just wouldn't be any fun.
- Depends on what kind of
fun you have on your mind.
- Wait a minute, what are you gettin' at?
This is gonna be a clean game.
The Colonel made a point of that.
Look what we brought ya.
(chattering)
Eh?
Not bad, huh?
(laughing)
(excited chattering)
- [Man] Hey, what's these?
- [Man] Shoulder pads.
(excited chattering)
- Okay, boys, let's unload this gear, huh?
Come on, let's go.
- [Man] Yeah, let's go
before you sell it, you mean.
(chattering)
- That goes for your boys, too, I hope.
I'm relying on you to
see that they play fair,
'cause I know you know all the tricks.
Don't disappoint me.
I heard you were coaching these
kids and I said to myself,
"This is a tough game
we're gonna be playing."
- You can't make a team
with these boys in 15 days.
What's important for me is
that they believe in themselves
and in sports.
It'll be a clean game.
No low blows.
- Shake, you gorilla.
(smacking)
- I'm beginning to like
you, you know that?
- Very bad sign.
(thudding)
- [Man] I didn't do anything.
- [Man] Get your paws off of him.
- [Man] You keep outta this, paisan.
He hyped his watch.
- [Man] Prove it.
- [Man] I don't know about
it and that's the truth.
- What's going on here?
- My watch disappeared.
- Lay off the kid.
You probably left it back at the base.
- Sarge, and we probably all did
'cause ours are missing, too.
- Well, if you're dumb
enough to let yourselves
get taken like that, you deserve it.
(playful music)
Okay, for just once, we'll
dispense with the kid gloves.
Come on.
- [Soldier] That's the way to go, Sarge.
- [Soldier] Damn straight.
- Hold it!
Take it easy.
(playful music)
(thudding)
(laughing)
Shut up, you.
(chuckling)
I gave my word there'd
be no monkey business.
- Since when?
- Since now.
- Oh, great.
'Cause I snitched this thing before.
(laughing)
- They're gonna come back.
- [Man] Probably not.
- Why?
- Because the guy's vampire strikes again.
(laughing)
- [Sarge] Push, boys.
- [Soldier] I could kill 'em.
- Take it easy, fellas.
Just a few more days and you'll be able
to get your sweet revenge.
- I can't wait to play that friggin' game.
- [Sarge] Meanwhile,
this is a good workout.
(mellow music)
(vocalizing in foreign language)
(squawking)
- You know, as my coach used to tell me,
if you want a team that wins,
you teach them how to sing.
(vocalizing in foreign language)
- Hey guys, if this is gonna help us win,
it's easy to practice singing.
(laughing)
- [Man] Hey Pa, bring on eats.
- [Man] Yeah.
- How 'bout this team of yours?
(mumbling)
Who's gonna pay for all of this?
- Oh, what you complaining about?
We elected you chairman of this team.
- Right, but you forgot
to elect a treasurer.
- Treasurer isn't the
only thing that's missing.
None of us are really any good
when it comes to breaking through.
Like somebody that can block for Jerry
so he doesn't get dumped.
If only we had somebody like Bulldozer.
- [Man] Yeah, right.
What about it?
- [Man] Everybody all together.
- [All] Bulldozer, Bulldozer,
Bulldozer, Bulldozer!
- I thought I made it clear,
and Spitz knows it very well.
I'm sorry boys, but
Bulldozer'll never play again.
- Listen Bulldozer,
you've done a lot for me
and I'm really grateful.
If it wasn't for you, who
knows where I'd be, but--
- I'm your coach, not an apostle.
- You can say whatever
you like, but I don't want
that guy on our team.
- You're the one who
said we needed a blocker.
- Yeah, but I meant you.
- Take that outta your mouth.
- Sorry, forgot.
But you saw what he did to me.
- Yeah, I saw it and I heard
you say you deserved it.
- Yeah, but that doesn't
stop him from being
a mean son of a B.
- We're not looking for a saint.
- Just like a rotten apple.
It'll ruin the whole team.
- You were like that too.
If playing sports helped you,
why shouldn't it help him?
- You'll never get him to play, anyway.
- I know how to tame these heavies.
Don't worry.
- I suppose you do, but don't expect me
to help you find him.
- Thanks.
(scraping)
- [Barber] Shave or a
haircut, what'll it be?
- Esvaldo.
- I don't know anybody called Esvaldo.
- Oh come on, shut up.
I'm looking for a guy
who when he hits you,
you think you been put
through a meat grinder.
- Listen, buddy.
You know who you're talking to?
If you're thinking you can push me,
you're making a sad mistake.
'Cause this is my personal business card.
- Mmm.
(thudding)
And this one here is mine.
- The bruiser you're looking for is
one Alberto Setickley, alias the bear.
He's about 6'6,
even the police feels better
to stay outta his way.
He works mostly along the beaches
of lifeguard (mumbling).
If you want, I'll bring ya to the place.
(crashing)
- [Bulldozer] Oh no, take it easy.
Oh, look.
(crashing)
(thudding)
(grunting)
- Nay, that's cheatin'.
- So you won't like this any better.
(slapping)
(grunting)
You ready to talk it over?
- [Alberto] Yeah, let's talk.
(thudding)
(grunting)
(crashing)
- So.
Shall we start talking now?
- Yeah, okay.
- Alright.
(thudding)
(grunting)
(splashing)
Remember, there's always somebody
who can hit harder than you,
and that goes for me, too.
(cracking)
(groaning)
(crashing)
(mellow music)
(crashing)
(cheering)
(chanting)
(waves crashing)
Alright boys.
Go work out along the beach.
(chattering)
You know something Spitz?
It's not just the rotten apples.
There are other things that spoil a team.
Mainly the prima donnas.
(chattering)
(engine zooming)
(horn honking)
(engine zooming)
(chattering)
- [Man] Hey, Spitzey!
Look at him, will ya?
- Where'd you get this boss?
What have you been doing?
- [Man] So that's where
you been hiding, eh?
No wonder nobody could find ya.
A 250, huh?
(chattering)
- What'd you do?
Sell the Tower of Pisa to the Japs?
- Huh uh, even better.
Got the ace to come up seven times
like I used to in (mumbling).
(chattering)
- So, you're gambling again, huh?
- What, are you smoking?
You crazy?
- It's okay.
- Bulldozer sees you.
- Yeah, by the way, where is he?
- Well, he's on the beach with the Bear.
Training, teaching him some new tricks.
- Yeah, how to crack somebody's back.
Special training for the new champ.
Well anyway, you guys.
I gotta split.
- Wait a minute, where you going?
- Oh, you can't do that, Spitzey.
- Sorry guys.
You go ahead and play
the game if you want.
I've got better things to do
than to waste my time here,
running after a dumb ball.
When you're tired of this
kid stuff, come visit me.
So long.
- [Man] Take it easy Spitzey!
Take it easy!
(bell tolling)
(chattering)
- [Man] 45 smackers.
- [Man] 50 for me.
- [Dealer] Here we go.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Place your bets.
Let's go, let's go.
Place your bets.
Come on boys, get with it.
This could be your lucky card.
- [Man] 20 on the third card.
- [Dealer] Anybody covering
that 20 thousand lires?
- [Man] I got it, I got it.
- [Dealer] Alright, uncover your cards.
And it is jack, first card wins.
- Somebody here is putting
the jinx on us, you know.
- [Dealer] Two, three, four, five, six.
Place your bet.
- [Man] 10 thousand number two.
- Gimme another hundred.
- [Dealer] Keep it going, keep it going.
- Now with this, it's 300 thousand lires.
- Yeah, I know how to add.
- [Dealer] Three, four, five, six.
Place your bets.
Oh, jeez, this is bad, bad, bad.
- [Man] 15 on two.
- Keep it going, keep it going.
- [Dealer] How 'bout you?
- Hey guys, it's late.
- Don't talk about football now, please.
- [Dealer] You bettin'?
- Yeah, 20 on number two.
- Up the cards.
- [Man] What do you got?
- [Man] What do you got?
Two.
(mumbling)
- Hey, that's the breaks.
Pass me the money, please.
- And there goes the motorcycle, dammit.
- Hey guys, it's already six.
- Yeah, and all's well.
- They're open here until midnight,
so what are you worried about?
- Who let's go and two,
three, four, five, six.
Bet, on the cards you put your dough.
- Okay, 20 for me.
(chattering)
- What about the other players?
Those guys are gonna get mad, you know.
- Yeah, tell 'em to eat cake.
- Don't forget you gotta
be ready in three days.
The game's on this Sunday.
- Relax, this hand'll be the last.
- [Dealer] How much?
- Five bills.
- [Man] Okay, I got 20
thousand in that last--
- [Dealer] Okay, there we go.
- [Man] Can I bet another ten?
- Yeah, just put it down, here you go.
Turn 'em over.
(cheering)
- It's a good thing I put 20 on it.
- [Man] Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
That's just the beginning.
Great comeback.
- [Man] Here we go again.
- [Dealer] Place your bets.
(waves crashing)
(mellow music)
- Aren't you going, too?
- Why should I?
(mellow music)
- What, are you following me?
- No, it's just, where ever
you're going, I'm going.
- Oh, why?
- 'Cause you beat me in a fight.
When someone beats me in a fight,
I get attached to 'em.
- How come it worked with
you and not the others?
- It doesn't really mean
so much, playing that game.
- No, it's not the game.
I'm sorry about those boys.
I really thought I'd made it with them.
- Look, before you split there's
something I wanna ask you.
- What?
- How come they used
to call you Bulldozer?
- Bulldozer?
(chuckling)
Who knows?
- [Alberto] Well, there
must have been a reason.
- Maybe.
It's because no matter what
the odds were, I never gave up.
(chattering)
- [Dealer] There we go,
two, three, four, five, six.
Take your card, place your bets.
(chattering)
- [Man] Oh, no.
- [Dealer] Ten wins.
Alright, take it easy, take it easy.
You can't win 'em all.
- [Man] Yeah, you can't win any.
You ain't givin' us the evil eye in here.
- [Dealer] Alright, enough of that.
Here we go again.
- [Man] This is my last 20 bills.
- One, two, three, four, five, six.
Place your bets.
- [Bulldozer] Put all
your money on this card.
- [Spitz] Bulldozer!
- [Man] What? Huh?
- Put your money here.
All of it.
- [Man] 20.
- [Brunette man] And 60 is 80.
- And 20 makes a hundred.
- 100 to cover.
- 20 for me.
- And 20 is 40.
- [Bulldozer] That's not enough.
- No.
- Nuh uh.
(grunting)
- Lift over your card.
(cheering)
(excited chattering)
- [Dealer] Alright, another round.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Keep it down, kids, keep it down.
(chattering)
- Hold it.
All your money here.
- [Man] All our money?
20, 30, 40, 50, 60.
- All, all.
- Another hundred.
- 200 covers.
- Come on.
- 100 on the board.
- 100 to cover.
- 50 and 50.
- Yeah, that's a hundred.
- [Dealer] Flip your cards.
(cheering)
- Black beard, you like fortune telling?
Then go get yourself a crystal ball.
- No, with me it's only luck,
show you what I mean.
You don't mind, huh?
So, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing.
King.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, king.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, king.
This system was invented
in Las Vegas in 1929.
Everybody knows it.
Only these punks could fall for it.
Alright, take your money and come away.
We got things to do.
- [Man] Here, hold it you.
(thudding)
(grunting)
- [Man] Let's get 'em guys.
(uptempo music)
- [Jerry] Have a coke, with a kicker.
(chattering)
(thudding)
(grunting)
- [Bulldozer] What are you doing?
(crashing)
(whimpering)
(thudding)
(grunting)
- Am I now his manager!
- [Bulldozer] Yeah, well
get back in the office!
(crashing)
(thudding)
- [Man] Hey Gigo, Gigo, where are you?
(thudding)
(grunting)

- [Man] How do you feel?
- [Man] A little better, thanks.

(yelling)
- Come in.
- Ah!
(uptempo music)
- [Bulldozer] You're the manager here.
(thudding)
(grunting)
(screaming)
- [Man In Washer] I'm the manager.
I'm the manager.

(uptempo marching music)
- [Announcer] And here's the lineup folks.
For the U.S. Army Rangers it's number 55.
McGraw, fullback.
Dolan, number 70 halfback.
(chanting)
(clapping)
(whistle blowing)
- Men, alright, this is the
moment you've been waiting for.
But remember, it's the first
impression that counts.
Those clowns are expecting
a hard game from us.
Instead, we'll play it light for a while,
and make sure that first
we have a nice lead
before we start putting them
through the meat grinder.
I'll tell you when and who
you gotta clobber first.
Okay.
- [All] Yeah!
- [Colonel] Attention!
- You scared?
- [All] No, no, we're not scared.
You scared?
- [Player] Maybe just a little.
- [Player] Hey, hey, hey.
- [All] Which one is all the way?
- You're not kidding anyone.
You are scared, and that's
the way it should be.
And there's no need to try to hide it.
Playing against guys like these,
it's normal to be scared.
The important thing is
guts, and that's all.
- Can I say something?
- [Bulldozer] Go ahead.
- Since this is the moment of truth,
I wanna say that I'm sorry for what I did.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- Me too.
- It's okay.
Instead I'm happy, because
notwithstanding trouble,
you'll still learn how to be a real team,
or to be real men and that's
all I wanted from you.
For once, let's hope the worst team wins.
(chanting)
- I'm expecting to see a
great game from you boys
and of course, the best team must win.
And the Sergeant has the best team.
One might say he's absolutely certain.
I hope I made myself clear.
- Mmm hmm.
(uptempo marching band music)
(cheering)
(chattering)
(chanting)
(whistle blowing)
- [All] The Bulldozers!
(whistle blowing)
Okay!
(uptempo marching band music)
- [Announcer] And here
they come on the field.
The Camp Durban Rangers and the visitors
from Papa Galioni's Tavern.
Let's give them a grand welcome.
(cheering)
And let's hope we see a good, clean game.
- [Man] I don't wanna
see a nice, clean game.
(chuckling)
("Star Spangled Banner")
(pansy anthem music)
(cheering)
- The field's been
cleared and there are only
a few seconds left before
the initial kickoff.
- [Player] What are we doing here?
- [Player] I don't
know, but it looks good.
When I say okay,
everybody says okay, okay?
- [All] Okay.
- [Player] Okay.
- [All] Okay!
(whistle blowing)
- The kickoff.
Camp Durban Rangers on the receiving end.
A lone, high kick right down
to the Rangers' 20 yard line.
And it's number 33, Jackson.
Jigsaw Jackson who receives the ball
and comes up fast around (mumbling).
Beautiful blocking by the Rangers
and it's Jigsaw Jackson all the way,
breezing through from his 20 yard line
for the first touchdown of the game.
(whistle blowing)
(marching band music)
Number 24 (mumbling) kicks the extra point
and it's Rangers seven, visitors zero.
(marching band music)
(cheering)
(chanting)
(mumbling) falls back, back for a pass,
a high (mumbling) touchdown
in just five minutes of play.
Nothing doing for the visitors.
- Put it up.
Knock 'em dead.
- And it's number 42, Ranger halfback
Charles Hilton Brown weaving his way
clear across the field and here it is.
There it is, touchdown number three
for the Camp Durban Rangers!
(chuckling)
(marching band music)
(mumbling)
No, a fake to Jigsaw Jackson who comes
steaming around right end,
dodges through the middle.
Fantastic, oh, he's stopped by Rossi 49,
on the visitors five yard line.
Looks like Hilton Brown number 42
is set to take the ball and
go piling right and center,
just a few inches from the touchdown zone.
(grunting)
(mumbling) Brown and over, over he goes!
Touchdown.
(cheering)
The pace is a little too exuberant.
The blue boys are just
no match for the Rangers,
and the fans seem to be swimming in it.
- Eichold, tackle.
Wilson, you take right end.
Cusak.
(mumbling)
- First down.
(grunting)
- [Announcer] Quarterback Johnny Culligan
carrying the ball around the left end.
He cut through, he's heading
right through the center.
He is flying away, Tony
Rossi right on his back,
number 38, he's down!
He's down! Fumble!
(mumbling) is after the ball.
He's got it!
(mumbling)
(marching band music)
(grunting)
Ball carried by, the ball, it's gone!
(yelping)
No, no, number 40 carries the ball,
tackled by Eddie Cusak.
The umpire seems to be hard (mumbling)
as to what decision to take for the rather
unorthodox way Gigo
Massey carried the ball.
The players seem to have a few
differences of opinion themselves.
- Hey!
Time!
- They call this a ball game.
(marching band music)
- Okay.
- [Player] Not too hot, huh?
- Not bad, kids.
You're going good, don't
you worry about nothing.
We got to make one touchdown.
That's all we need to win.
- [Player] Yeah, but they
always get the jump on us
when we start our play.
- Naturally, you telegraph your cues.
You gotta speak Italian when you're
calling out, not English.
Got to stick next to Jerry,
and Jerry, you carry the
ball like it was a wallet,
full of money.
You fake left and then you
go right through the middle,
like a tornado, okay?
- [All] Okay.
Let's go.
(marching band music)
- I want you to take that guy down.
- [Player] 71?
- That's right, the Bear, break him.
(uptempo marching band music)
(chanting)
- [Announcer] Lateral
pass to number 12 to 45,
Jerry, visitors star ball carrier,
coming up from his 30 yard line,
shootable blocking by number 71, the Bear.
Bear Setickley.
- Come on.
- [Announcer] He's
blowing down the Rangers
like toothpicks as Jerry carries the ball
(mumbling) for the touchdown.
- [Jerry] Ah!
- [Announcer] Down he goes.
(whistle blowing)
- [Player] First down for us.
- [Announcer] Only a few
yards away from the goal line.
(chattering)
Sergeant Harry Kemper, Rangers'
coach, is calling time.
- Perfect.
You are born players.
- I want you to knock those
spaghetti benders down.
- Now, you listen good Bear.
You'll be covered 'cause
they'll only think
you're out to block Jerry.
Instead you, Jerry, go
right to the middle.
Only five yards to make, you hear?
And you kids are gonna make it!
Okay?
- [All] Okay!
(grunting)
- Okay?
- [All] One, two, three, Rangers!
(whistle blowing)
(speaking foreign language)
- [Player] Gimme the ball.
- [Announcer] Now number 45, Jerry going
through center and he's
catapulted over the Rangers'
scrimmage line!
Beautiful play!
(grunting)
- Hey nine, watch your left!
(moaning)
- [Player] What's wrong, Jerry, your leg?
- It hurts.
(cheering)
- [Man] Alright, take him off.
- [Player] Don't worry kid, we'll make it.
(marching band music)
(cheering)
(whistle blowing)
- [Announcer] And it's
number 45, Hilton Brown,
coming fast around right, but 35 Johnny
is closing in fast.
- Enough Brown.
- [Announcer] Fumble!
- What did I tell ya?
- [Announcer] And 48 Tony Rossi intercepts
and is coming down past the
visitors, dodging beautifully.
Ooh, and once again Hilton
Brown (mumbling) shin level.
Mean play.
- [Sarge] That's the way I like it.
(moaning)
- [Man] Alright, where does it hurt, lad?
Another leg.
(cheering)
- Hey coach, we're ready.
- Unh unh.
- Unh unh.
(marching band music)
- [Man] Alright look, down the line.
25, 28 and watch that left tackle.
Okay?
- [All] Okay!
- [Both] Yah!
(chattering)
- We're very eager to play.
- No.
- [Announcer] And it's
Jigsaw Jackson coming down
fast for the Rangers in
his inimitable style.
There he goes, playing his
way through like a ramrod!
He's over the visitors 30 yard line,
the 25, the 20 yard
line, and he (mumbling).
It's getting wild!
- [Player] The stretcher!
- [Announcer] That's the
third time the stretcher
has come out in the last
ten minutes of play.
(moaning)
(mumbling)
(whistles blowing)
(stammering)
- Come on!
- [Ref] Dammit.
- [Both] Coach, we're ready.
- Mmm.
- [Both] He said yes.
- [Announcer] Substitution,
left guard, left tackle.
Numbers 35 and 42 for the visitors.
(marching band music)
(chattering)
(grunting)
(moaning)
("Anchors Aweigh")
- Well, Bear, now is the time.
We don't make it, that's it.
- Okay.
- You see 'em?
Block 'em.
- [Announcer] A (mumbling)
pass out to Jigsaw Jackson
and intercepted by the Bear, number 71.
Coming up for this ten yard
line like a locomotive!
- Come on, go.
(thudding)
(playful marching band music)
Keep going, Bear, keep going.
- Kill!
(thudding)
(mellow music)
(thudding)
- Dammit!
Get back, get back!
- [Announcer] It's a shame.
Up 'til now, the game
was rough and tumble,
not altogether orthodox
but it was football.
Now, it's just (mumbling)
angry men run wild.
(grunting)
(wailing)
- Not cannibalism too?
(marching band music)
(arguing)
(gunshot booming)
- They even use guns.
- (mumbling) second
quarter is over at last.
(cheering)
(chattering)
(gasping)
(moaning)
(cheering)
- This was supposed to be a clean game.
- Why?
Is something wrong?
- Everything is wrong.
- A game's a game.
What did you expect, a picnic?
(laughing)
- Not a picnic, but a clean game.
- If it's okay with the
umps, who am I to complain?
Come on, Bulldozer.
Let's face it.
I mean, man hasn't lived
if he hasn't learned
to accept defeat.
(thwopping)
(players laughing)
- Okay, okay.
You just convinced me.
- [Players] Bye, bye.
(catcalling)
- [Bulldozer] Shut up.
(crashing)
(whistling)
- Quick lap.
(speaking foreign language)
- [Player] I'm part of the que.
I'm passing the ball.
- [Player] Time out.
- [Player] What for?
- Ho, ho, look.
(uptempo music)
- Substitution number 63.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen an
old number 63 is Bulldozer!
(cheering)
The Rangers taken completely by surprise.
Playing for the visitors is
one of the all time greats
of the gridiron, returned
to his native country
after his unexpected
retirement from the game.
He's once again back on the field.
Bulldozer!
(whooping)
(cheering)
- Didn't you swear you'd never play again?
- We're not playing a real game.
(speaking foreign language)
(whistle blowing)
(thudding)
(grunting)
(mellow music)
(whistle blowing)
- Sir, a direct hit.
A grenade hit our post, sir, and we,
and we are awaiting orders.
Roger and out.
(thudding)
- I don't know about the
roger, but you're out alright.
(chattering)
(thudding)
(wailing)
(thudding)
(whistles blowing)
(chattering)
(yelling)
(whistles blowing)
- Hey, umpire, why don't you check
how many players they have?
(mumbling)
- [Ref] 16 in all.
Alright, five of you, out.
(cheering)
- Don't suppose you get to see the likes
of this kind of football anywhere.
Not only are our visitors going whole hog
'cause there it is, substitution
for the Ranger's coach...
Face to face Bulldozer.
- You'll never get your
touchdown, Bulldozer.
- Watch out, because here it comes.
(speaking foreign language)
(mellow music)
(thudding)
(grunting)
(clanging)
(whooping)
(catcalling)
(thudding)
(crashing)
(cheering)
- [Players] Bulldozer!
Bulldozer! Bulldozer!
(cheering)
(chanting)
- Hey, hey, hey.
(all chanting)
- Bulldozer, my dear friend.
You know what my worst defect is?
Putting my faith in a nincompoop
such as Sergeant Kemper.
