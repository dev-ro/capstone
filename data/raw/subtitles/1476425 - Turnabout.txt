- Sorry, I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Sorry.
- It was that way.
- Are you okay?
- Is he all right?
- Whoa!
- Easy, man.
Easy, easy.
- I'm good, I'm good.
I'm all right.
I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
You guys are fishing?
You catch anything?
Thank you very much.
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm awake.
- Yo, man.
You all right?
- Operator, I need to
make a collect call.
Yes, a collect call, please.
Yes.
311
399
2639.
For Perry Hayes.
Yes, please.
I'll wait.
Thank you, operator.
Thanks.
- Come on, honey.
Just relax.
- Jesus Christ, Lisa.
I'm trying.
- Just ignore it.
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hey, Billy Cain?
- Perry.
Billy, it's after 12:30.
What's going on?
- I know.
Listen, I really need help.
I'm at the bridge about
a mile down the road.
It's a long story,
but I'm soaking wet.
- No, it's all right,
it's no problem.
I'll be right there.
Yeah, I'll bring you
a change of clothes.
You just sit tight, okay?
- Yeah, okay.
Okay, okay, thanks, my friend.
- All right.
- Who was that?
- That was my best
friend from high school.
I haven't seen that
guy in about 15 years.
- Well, what did he want?
- I don't know, but
he was really upset though.
He said he was in
a lot of trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
- I don't know.
- Well, why did he call you?
- Again, I don't know.
It's almost 12:30.
You have to work in the morning.
- What am I supposed
to tell him, baby?
"I'm sorry, Billy,
it's almost 12:30,
"I have to work in the morning"?
- I can't believe you.
You haven't seen or heard
from this guy in ages
and he calls out of the blue
and you're off to his rescue?
- He obviously
needs my help, Lisa.
Otherwise, why would
he have called me?
He may not have anybody
else he can call.
- That's just great.
You're off to lord knows where
in the middle of the night
to see someone you haven't
seen since high school.
That's just great.
- I'll see you later on.
Billy.
- Perry.
My friend.
- You okay?
Hey, whoa.
What happened?
- I'm soaking wet.
I'm David Scudzvian.
I'm not sure.
I don't even know where I'm at.
I'm a real mess, Perry.
I took some sleeping pills.
- How long ago?
- An hour, half
hour, I'm not sure.
- Should I take
you to the hospital?
- No, no fuckin' hospitals.
- Okay, okay.
- I hate those fuckin' places.
- How many did you take, Billy?
- Uh, I don't know.
Eight or 10, I'm not sure.
I, uh.
- Come on.
- I just need
to get some coffee.
- It's okay, we'll
get you to the diner.
Come on, let's get out of here.
So, what caused all this?
- Long story, my man.
Perry?
- Yeah?
- Perry, pull over.
Please, pull over.
- Get it all out, buddy.
You all right?
- Yeah.
It's good to see you, my man.
- It's good to see
you too, buddy.
- Sorry about that.
- Did you puke on my car?
- No, no, it went
out the window.
- I was just kidding.
So, what caused all this?
- It's this basic,
you know, disconnected,
disjointed feeling
that I'm having, you know?
I'm in my 30's, Perry.
I'm feeling real down
about myself, you know?
All this struggling
and pain.
This bare fucking
pain.
You know, I'm working my
ass off and just going
nowhere real fast.
And the worse it gets,
the more time just passes.
I just...
I can't even get excited about
anything anymore, you know?
I've become like
desensitized and numb.
That's no way to be.
I'm just sick and
tired of all this shit.
There's just mounds.
The mounds of shit.
- Wow.
- Shall I continue?
- No.
No, that's okay.
- I know.
I guess I piled that on a
little thick there, didn't I?
- Typical Billy Cain style.
Thank you.
- Now, I was working three jobs.
My checkbook is still
in the negative.
Look at you, man.
You look great.
Looks like you're
doing real well.
- Thank you, but
things are never great.
I mean, Lisa and I have
had our ups and downs,
but we have a child now,
and that changes everything.
- No shit?
You got a kid?
- Yep.
Jarrod, he's six.
- That's fantastic.
Whoa, so you probably
have a great job.
- It's decent.
I'm able to put away money
for his college fund.
- That's nice.
What is it that you do?
- I'm an optician.
- Mm.
Oh, you're an eye doctor?
- Not exactly a doctor per say,
but I fit people
with eyeglasses.
That's pretty much my job.
- That's fantastic.
See, this is exactly
what I'm saying.
You know, you're established
and that's great.
I never was.
You know, I was jumping
around from job to job.
The longest gig I had,
you know what it was?
It was pumping gas.
You know how long
that lasted, Perry?
Six freakin' months.
Six months.
Standing out there in the dead
of winter and pumping gas,
and cleaning other
people's windows.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
I even cleaned your window once.
- What?
- Yeah.
When you were in that
nice SUV of yours,
you had the wife in the car.
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I don't know.
I was too embarrassed.
- How long ago was this?
- About a year ago.
I just got out of rehab.
I was hooked on pain meds,
living in my old man's trailer.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
You get my drift?
- Why did you call me?
- Honestly, Perry.
You're my only friend.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, I burned
all my old Bridges.
I don't blame 'em really.
I mean, it's my fault.
You know, I would
steal from them.
I'd steal shit like
jewelry, drugs, booze.
Anything to make a fast buck.
You know, they weren't
like real friends,
they were more like,
transitory friends, you know?
You're a true friend, Perry.
Even though I haven't
talked to you in ages.
- Well, I'm here now.
So, at least you don't
have to worry too much.
I guess you get pretty
down on yourself.
- Yeah, I have, but
lately I've just been
feelin' more complacent.
I think that's worse.
- Why is that?
- Because it cons you into
thinking that there's hope.
- What's it
take for a guy to get
some service around here?
- I'm so hungry.
- Come on, food.
- Look at these fags.
- Hey, do you mind?
- What?
- You see, I haven't seen
my friend here in a while
and we're just
trying to catch up.
- Is that right?
Looks more like a
lover's quarrel to me.
- How's the date going, boys?
- Wow, you're a real
fucking wise-ass, huh?
Trying to look bad in
front of your girl?
- Billy.
- Got me pegged, huh?
- It wasn't that hard.
See, I was your age.
I remember when I
didn't give a shit
about anything or anyone.
- Oh, really.
- That's a real dangerous
way to live, my friend.
- Is that a threat, tough guy?
- Billy.
- Come on, man, chill out.
- Hey, come on.
This is crazy.
- Yeah, listen to
your boyfriend.
- All right.
All right.
It's all right.
All right.
- Freaks.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
They're young.
- I'm gonna be right back.
I was trying to be nice.
This is what you wanted,
you fucking piece of shit.
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah, I had
way too much coffee.
- You got some
ketchup on your hand.
- Oh, thanks.
Come on, let's get outta here.
- Sure, I guess that's
probably a good idea.
- That was good back there.
I really needed that.
- Well, what's that?
- The meal.
It hit the spot.
- That was kind of weird
back there with that kid.
- Yeah, dumb little fucker.
- You haven't changed.
- Nope, not too much.
- So, where to, Billy?
- I could really use a drink.
How about you?
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious as a heart attack.
- What the hell's gonna be
open this time of night?
It's 1:30.
It's still early.
- That's early for you.
I've gotta work in the morning.
- Oh, come on, man.
You can check people's
eyes in your sleep.
Live a little.
- I was just doin' just
fine until you called.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, pull over.
- What's the matter?
- Just pull over.
Thank you for rescuing
me tonight, all right?
You did save my life.
I owe you, Perry.
I'm a nuisance, man.
I should go.
- Where are you going?
Where are you going?
- Don't worry about me.
Go back to your wife and kid.
- Billy, it's the
middle of the night.
You're in the middle of nowhere.
- I'm a survivor, Perry.
Remember?
- Billy, I didn't mean
it back there now.
Come on, I'm sorry.
Just get back in the car.
- No, no, you were right.
You had every right, okay?
I needed your help tonight,
and you helped me out.
You did, okay?
Like a true friend.
I thought we just could
hang out a little longer,
talk some more, that's all.
- That's great, Billy.
Just get in the car.
- I don't want be
a bother, Perry.
I don't want to bring
you down with me, man.
- Billy, you're not
going to be a bother.
Just get in the car.
- You sure, Perry?
I don't want to be an
inconvenience to you, you know?
I've been that too many
times before in my life.
- Billy, I'm sure.
Now, get in the car.
Come on, it's
freezing out there.
- Yeah, it is.
All right.
- So, where to?
- How about the old
strip club on route nine?
- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.
- I haven't been to
one of those places
since my bachelor party.
- Come on, it'll be fun.
Besides, you definitely
need a drink after all that,
that serious talk back there.
- I will second that.
- Do you mind if we stop at
that mini mart on the way?
I gotta pick up some smokes.
It's a bad habit.
Need anything?
- No.
- All right, be right back.
- Hey, did you get 'em?
- Yep.
- All right, Billy.
I've been thinking.
- Uh-oh.
- No, I'm serious, man.
I really need to get home.
- Perry.
- Come on, man.
I've got a lot of
appointments tomorrow, man.
People depend on me.
- How fuckin' hard is it to
fit people with eyeglasses?
- It's a little bit more
complicated than that, Billy.
I mean, I've got a
wife and a kid at home.
It's 2:00 they're sleeping.
What's the big deal?
We'll go out, have a couple
drinks, reminisce a little,
and then you go home
and hop back into bed.
How hard is that?
- Man, I'm really glad
I was able to come
and I'm really glad
nothing happened, but.
- But, you're work
is done here, right?
- That's not what I said, Billy.
I said I've got obligations.
Man, Monday's are the worst.
- Yeah.
How do you think I feel?
- One drink.
One, all right?
- You got it.
One drink, some conversation,
and then we're out of there.
Come on, let's get out of here.
- Yeah.
- So, I really do want to
thank you about tonight.
I was a real goner
until you showed up.
- Forget about it.
Come on, get in the car.
- Let's move on.
Perry, how the hell do you
still live around here?
- What are you talking about?
I have a business.
Besides, you're
from around here.
- Yeah, but I moved
away plenty of times.
Things just never clicked.
- I guess I can understand that.
I mean, except for the time
I went away to college,
I've never really
lived anywhere.
This is pretty much home to me.
- Not me.
It never felt like home to me.
No way.
I dread it here.
Especially this time of year.
- Well, why are you here now?
- I moved away plenty of times.
It's like this black
hole of a magnet.
It just keeps pulling me back.
- Lisa loves it here.
She takes the baby to the
beach every day in the summer.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- That's nice.
That's nice.
Must be nice to have
someone that you love.
The way I see it, the
joy that kid brings you.
- It's a big responsibility,
don't get me wrong,
but he's so worth it.
He's smart as a whip, too.
He's reading like
10 books a day.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, he's a chip
off the old block.
- Oh, so, he's like an
obsessive compulsive
tight ass like you?
- Hey, that's not cool.
- Oh, it's great you
spawned a monster.
- That's awesome.
Hey, I got you laughing again.
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.
- A far cry from where I
was a few hours ago, huh?
You got some tunes.
That is nice.
It soothes the soul, Perry.
- I remember when you
use to play guitar.
- Yeah, ages ago.
I played in some rock and
jazz bands, lived in New York,
played the blue note.
Things were good for a while.
- Well, what happened?
- Oh, man.
I was living a dream.
I couldn't hack it.
I got outta high school
thinking that I was going
to make a living playing jazz.
Things just never clicked.
I mean, that just ain't...
It's just not an
easy life style.
- Yeah, I can see what you mean.
You don't play anymore at all?
- No.
I pawned all my
guitars years ago.
I haven't picked one up in ages.
I don't know.
Every time things got too
wacky, I would just end up
coming back home to this place.
- So, Billy.
Where is this place?
- It's not that far.
It's about a mile up the
road past the link motel.
Remember that?
Take a left, and I think
it's like four blocks down.
- This is crazy.
- This is crazy?
No, no, no, no, no.
Crazy is you playing
with eyeglasses all day.
- Hey, it's a fucking living.
What are you talking about?
- I'm sure it is.
I think that's the motel.
- Is that it?
Man, this place is
a real shithole.
- Yeah, that's what
makes it so great.
- Really?
You come here often?
- Only when I need to pop a nut.
- You are one sick fuck, Billy.
- Wait, till you
see these girls.
Nice drinks.
You'll have a good time.
Isn't this great?
- You can't see that at a diner.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
- To a true friend.
I'm broke, honey.
I don't tip.
- What the hell was that?
- That was no money.
I washed away my pride.
I can't.
- Jesus, Billy.
You gotta tip the
waitress, come on.
- You're right.
- You know, I'll be right back.
Honey, hi.
I know, I know it's late.
Well, I don't know.
This guy is in real
bad shape, honey.
I don't know how
long I'm going to be.
Lisa?
Lisa?
- Hey.
Got you another.
- Thanks.
- Everything all right?
- I just talked to Lisa.
She hung up on me.
Well, hello.
- Well, hello yourself.
- Um, you might want to
take it easy on the old man.
He's kinda new at this.
- Well, it won't hurt a bit.
- Okay.
- I'll be back, amigo.
- So, what's your name?
- I'm Perry.
- Oh.
I'm Sherri, Perry.
- That's nice.
I'll be right back.
- Oh, no, he'll be fine.
Let's have a toast.
- Okay, to what?
- To tonight
and all of its surprises.
- Leo.
- Mr. Billy Cain.
It's how you grace himself.
You graced my establishment.
Sorry, I'm a little
lost for words here.
Where you been?
- I've been around.
- Really?
New friends now, huh?
- How you been?
How's business?
- It's okay.
Course I could use
that money you owed me.
- I know, I know,
I did not forget.
Things are going good right now.
I'm gonna be good for it.
- You look like shit.
- I just had a couple
rough, uh, you know.
- You know what I want to do?
I want to take one
of these bottles
and break it over
your fucking head.
- Come on, Leo.
I came to apologize.
- Apologize, huh?
- Well, you can
apologize over a drink.
How about that?
- All right, I'll have a drink.
- Good.
Except, you know, I
water this shit down,
but I got a great bottle
back in the office.
- Leo, I gotta get
back to my buddy.
- No.
Your friend is doing fine, okay?
What about this friend?
You can have a drink with
an old friend, right?
Come on, Billy.
For old time's sake.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Yo, don't take
this for sweetness.
I actually had genuine
concern for you
and that turned into
a seething rage.
- All right, all right.
I know, I know.
That's why I came by, you know?
I'm not a scumbag.
- You still ain't setting
me up with anything.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You see this?
That's why I see them
always bent over.
This is where all my profits go.
Up these lovely noses.
Georgia, look who's here.
- Georgia.
- Billy.
- Georgia.
- Come here.
- This is sweet little Susan.
- Susan.
Just a couple minutes.
- No, it's Sarah.
I'm sorry, Sarah.
- She's new.
- She's new.
- I gotta head back.
- Sit down.
- Come on, sit down.
- Does it seem like old times?
- Yeah.
- A little bit, right?
- Yep.
- Look at Georgia's face.
I haven't her smile like
that in a long time.
Guess who's back in business?
- Who?
- Carlos.
- Really, no shit?
- Stamped key.
Cut him a line, Sarah.
- Nah, not tonight
'cause I gotta go.
- Hey, hey, hey, sit
down and do a line.
You just got here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Right on, I mean, Jesus.
- All right, I did
a fucking line.
- So, what does that
mean, you're leaving?
- Yeah.
- You're just gonna
go, that's it?
- I got a meeting, man.
- Come and do my drugs
and then you're gone?
- Well, then....
- You asked me to
do a line, Leo.
- No, hey, hey, hey.
You gotta go, you gotta go.
Say goodbye, girls.
Say goodbye to Billy as
he walks out the door.
- I'm gonna be good on it.
- You keep saying that.
Keep insulting me.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give me a hug.
Give me a fucking hug.
That's not so hard.
You're not going to
disappoint me again, right?
- No, I swear.
- Good.
Go see your little friend.
Here, for you and
your little friend.
Compliments of Carlos.
- Thanks, Leo.
- Yeah.
Sarah.
See him out and lock the door.
And make sure you lock
the door this time.
Wanna tell me what
that was all about?
- What?
- This, what, I don't know.
What was that all about?
- What?
- Grabbing him all
over the place.
- I thought you wanted me to.
- No, I mean, whatever.
- Trying to help a boy out.
You're my boy, right?
- You're a junkie,
you know that?
A slut junkie.
You're pretty.
- So are you.
- Stay put.
- Everything all right here?
- I think it's
getting really late.
- One drink, come
on, enjoy the show.
Besides, I think
that girl likes you.
- Hey, stranger.
- Oh, a little shiatsu.
- I can't do this.
- Relax.
- It's time for us
to go in the back.
- I think that's a good idea.
- Oh, wow.
- See you in a minute.
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I think I'm drunk.
- That's good.
- Get her, cowboy!
- I think somebody
spiked my drink.
- What's that?
- My drink.
- Your drink?
- Yeah, my drink.
- Yeah, what about it?
- I think somebody
put something in it.
- Who did it?
- I don't know.
- Well, how do you feel?
- I feel fucked up.
- That's never a bad thing.
- I'm just not use
to this, Billy.
- Enjoy it.
- So, what time
you ladies getting off?
- Actually, our
shift is over now.
- Oh, is that right?
- Is your friend all right?
- Mm-hmm.
He'll be fine.
Wanna take this
party somewhere else?
- Are you gonna pay
us for our lap dance?
- Um, of course.
- You in?
It will be fun.
- I guess so.
Okay.
- We're gonna have fun.
- You feeling any better?
- Maybe, a little better, man.
Where are we going?
- This is a nice ride, Perry.
- What's that?
- Want some gum?
- No, thank you.
- She likes your car, man.
- Well, thanks.
- Perry's a doctor.
- Oh.
- Well, not exactly.
Billy, where are we going?
- You'll see.
Just making a quick stop.
We're almost there.
All right.
Let's get this started.
- Where's Perry?
- He's in the John, hon.
He'll be right back.
Shall we?
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Everything all right in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just feel a little loopy.
Where's Billy?
Oh.
You want a fresh one?
- Sure.
Yes, please.
- So, how long
have you been dancing?
- About two years.
- Is that so?
Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Oh, this is crazy, I'm, uh,
I'm so not used to
this sort of thing.
- You don't pick up strippers?
- No, I don't.
- How much of that
stuff you gonna do?
- Enough to make
me see more clear.
I'm gonna go check on my boy.
I come bearing gifts.
- Wow, the good old days.
- I'll do it.
- Wow, easy, baby.
Taking over?
There's plenty to go around.
What's up, buddy?
- Nothing.
- Is this where the party is?
- Mm-hmm.
Right here.
- You want to come to bed?
- Oh, my.
- All right, my friend.
For old time sake.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, come on, Perry.
- No, no, no.
- Come on, Perry.
- Come on.
If you do it, I gotta
surprise for you.
- Really?
What would that be?
- Nice.
- Oh, my god.
Serious?
I haven't done
this shit in years.
- Come on, it's
like riding a bike.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.
I only do it on
special occasions.
- And this would
be one of those?
- Oh, yeah, baby.
- Billy, where did you
get all this stuff?
- This guy Leo back at the club.
- We gotta get back to work.
- Excuse me, duty calls.
- He's funny.
- He's a good guy.
- Yeah.
So, how about you?
When are you going
to make your move?
- Oh, I'm working up to it.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe, you should work up
to it a little faster, huh?
- Oh, yeah?
- How about some whiskey?
- Whiskey makes my face feel
like it's going to fall off.
- That's good.
- Good.
Well then, bring us two.
- There we go.
Whiskey for you.
- Oh, thank you.
Cheers
- cheers.
Are you all right with all this?
- I'm just along for the ride.
- Are you now?
- Lord, help me.
- Oh, shit.
Oh, I have to go.
Shit.
- What's up?
- My babysitter is
watching my kid.
- Oh, come on.
- No, come on.
I'm serious.
I have to go.
- Okay, I'll drive you home.
I'm fucked up.
- Yeah?
How long were we asleep?
- It's all good.
What's up, money?
- I need to go home.
I'm going home.
- Are you all right?
- No.
- I just gotta drive
her home real quick.
She's gotta head home.
Let me use the wheels.
Enjoy the night, it's young.
Have fun.
Let's go.
- Perry.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, okay, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- What is the problem?
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just not feeling
it, that's all.
- Whatever.
Wow.
You know something?
I feel really sorry for you.
I mean, what's the problem, huh?
Can't you get it up?
- Yeah, that's good.
Insult my masculinity.
Real class.
- You had no trouble
back at the club.
Hey, you're the one
who brought me here.
- You know what?
Correction, I'm not the one
who brought you anywhere.
This was all Billy's idea.
All of this.
- Well, he had no
trouble with candy.
I'm starting to think you're
a little soft for a reason.
Yeah? What are you
trying to say now?
- Just saying, you know, you
can't rise to the occasion,
and it's pretty pathetic.
What a waste of cock and balls.
Hey, tell me something.
What's your wife think
of your little problem?
- Yeah, fuck you.
- Fuck you!
- You know what.
What are you talking about?
Is this what you want?
- What are you going
to fuck me now or what?
Go ahead.
- Love birds.
Holy.
Jesus, dude.
Must have had a
killer time, huh?
Perry?
Hey, Perry.
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey, man, this
doesn't look too good.
Perry, you wanna tell
me what happened?
- I don't know.
- Sherri?
Sherri, hey.
Come on.
Sherri.
Sherri.
Hey, Sherri.
Hey, Sherri!
- Is she dead?
- Sit down.
Sit down!
- Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
- From start to finish, please.
- It's all a blur, Billy.
I remember you leaving,
and I remember us
sitting on the bed,
but I don't remember
anything else.
- What about the blood, and
all those scratch marks on you.
- It's all a blur, Billy.
- A blur?
A blur, that's
all you gotta say?
A blur?
I'm sorry, my man.
This is a little bit
more than a blur.
- Look, it all happened
so fast, all right?
Look, I just, I don't.
- You what?
- I don't fucking know.
- What, did you kill her?
- Jesus Christ, I didn't
fucking kill her, Billy.
Oh god, I don't think I did.
- Okay, great, you
don't even know?
And when I left,
everything was fine here.
I wasn't even gone that long.
I come back and there's
some dead chick in the bed.
What do you expect
me to think, huh?
Well?
Jesus.
Jesus, man.
We need to get control
of this situation.
This is some bad shit, Perry.
We need to figure
some things out here.
- Like what?
- Like what do we
do with the body?
- Jesus Christ,
I didn't kill her, Billy.
- This is just crazy, man.
Okay, okay, breathe.
Breathe.
Whatever happened,
happened, okay?
It's over now.
We're gonna take
care of this, okay?
Hey, I need you to
pull yourself together.
Breathe, breathe.
Let's wrap the body, and let's
try to get it out of here.
Okay?
Okay?
Fuck.
Give me a hand.
Perry.
Perry.
Perry, give me a fucking hand.
Whatever happened,
happened, okay?
It's over now.
We gotta take care of this.
Hey, I need you to get a
hold of yourself, Capisce?
All right?
- Okay, Capisce.
- Grab her feet and we'll
take her out of here, okay?
All right?
You do that for me?
All right, let's do this quick.
Get in the car.
How you holding up?
- Not too good.
- Just stay cool, all right?
I know this wasn't on
the agenda, but relax.
We'll deal with it
the best we can, okay?
Okay?
- Yeah.
Where are we going?
- The beach.
Some guy I know has
a boat tied up there.
- I'm really sorry
about this, Billy.
- I know, I know.
Hang in there, pal.
Just try to hang in there.
- I'm trying.
- I'm trying.
Perry?
It's time.
- Where are we?
- The beach.
Come on, let's go.
I got the boat there.
Come on.
Hey, grab her feet.
Ready?
Right here, right here.
Grab some rocks.
We've got to weigh
the body down.
Grab some rocks.
Come on.
What, are you just
going to stand there?
- What do you want me to do?
- Help me carry it to the boat.
Grab the other end.
Come on.
Okay, watch the rocks.
Watch it, Perry.
What the fuck?
This way.
Grab the oars, Perry.
All right, push her out.
Let's go.
All right, here.
You know, Perry.
I really wish you would tell me
what happened back there.
- What do you want me
to tell you, Billy?
- How about the truth?
Why don't you just come clean?
You owe me that much.
- I owe you?
Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.
- Who came to your
rescue tonight, Billy?
- Don't hand me that shit, man.
You just killed some chick.
All right, what the
fuck is wrong with you?
- I told you I didn't kill her.
It had to be an accident.
- Sure didn't look that way.
Strangle marks, you
call that an accident?
- I didn't touch
her that way, Billy.
And I swear to god I
didn't touch her that way.
It's all a blank.
I remember bits and
pieces of it, really.
She was on the bed,
she wanted to have sex,
and I told her no
and she got mad.
And the rest of it I
remember her as Lisa.
I remember thinking of
Lisa, and my heart pounded
out of my chest, but I didn't
fucking kill her, Billy.
I would never kill somebody.
- I really want to
believe you, Perry. I do.
You know, but she was
pretty beat up, man.
- I know, I saw her.
- You know we can't breathe a
word of this to anyone, right?
- Let's just do this thing.
- Well, let's get back.
- You need me to
give you a ride anywhere?
- No, I think
I'm just gonna walk.
- Where to?
- I'm not sure.
I need to clear
my head out a bit.
You be careful.
- Shouldn't I be
telling you that?
- No.
- Hey, don't be a stranger.
- I won't.
- What time is it?
It's almost 6:30.
- Where were you all night?
- It's a long story.
- You have to be in at nine.
- I'm not gonna go in till noon.
- Sweetie, it's time for bed.
- Okay.
- Good night, baby.
I love you.
- Love you.
You all right?
- I'm fine.
- You didn't say much at dinner.
Jarrod was trying to
tell you about his day,
but your weren't listening.
- I'll see him tomorrow.
I just had a real rough
day at the office.
- You wanna talk about it?
- Not really.
There you go, buddy.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
We'll see you next week.
- I'll be out of town next week,
but I'll call and
make an appointment.
- Probably a good idea.
- Thank you, Perry.
- See you later.
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Well, hello, stranger.
You remember me?
- Yeah.
- I guess you heard they
found Sherri's body, right?
You remember Sherri?
- Yeah, I remember.
- The fish had
eaten her eyes out.
Isn't that gross?
- Why are you here?
- I didn't think you were
gonna play dumb with me.
I think you know why I'm here.
- How did you find me?
- It was easy.
It's a small town, people talk.
I heard that you
beat Sherri to death
and then dumped her
body in the ocean.
- You heard wrong.
- Perry.
I think it's pretty obvious
what went down that night.
- Is it?
- I think you know
what I'm trying to say.
- No, I don't think I know
what you're trying to say.
- What I'm trying to say is
that I think it's important
that you do the right thing.
- I think you should leave.
- How much are these?
- Look.
- I don't think
you're in any position
to tell me what to do.
- Listen, you know what?
It's your word against mine.
- Really?
Look at what I got.
- What's that?
- It's a surveillance
tape from the club.
It shows you leaving with Sherri
the night she was murdered.
- Murdered?
- Murdered, killed, whatever
you want to call it.
- Big deal.
You're on that tape, too.
Yeah, but I ain't dead.
Don't get stupid, please.
- All right.
What do you want?
- Well, that's easy.
How much is this worth to you?
- I don't know.
- 200,000 in cash.
- 200,000 in cash?
I don't have that kind of money.
- Oh, I think you have
that kind of money.
You have a successful business.
I think you have
a few properties.
I think you have
plenty of money.
- Who else knows about this?
- No one.
Not even the owner of the club.
And this is the
only copy, I swear.
- No, I don't have it.
- Well, you better do your best.
- Yeah, and then what?
- I'm out of your
life like that.
Okay.
- This is all I've got.
- Hmm.
How much is it?
- It's enough.
It's emergency money.
Actually, that's my
kid's college fund.
- I think this qualifies
as an emergency, don't you?
Do you have a bag?
Poor kid.
Too bad his dad's a
cold blooded murderer.
You never answered me.
- About what?
- How much are these worth?
- They're $1,000.
- I'll take 'em.
I should get out of here.
