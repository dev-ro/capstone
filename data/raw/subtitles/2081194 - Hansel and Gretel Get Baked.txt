140.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey, PG&E.
Oh!
Residents of 140 Wicker Lane,
using over 98,000 KWH.
Wait till he
hears about this.
Oh!
I knew it!
Wait till the cops see this.
Hey, hey!
Okay it's called,
Black Forest High,
and it is the best
friggin' high ever.
I'll be the judge of that.
It's like,
one part Swiss Miss,
one part Snow White,
there's definitely
some White Queen,
but, there's something else in it,
and I can't put my finger on it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let it sink in, trust me when
this stuff hits, it hits.
I see what you mean.
Very smooth,
very mellow,
very wow.
Where'd you get it?
Manny, he's handing
out samples,
some little old lady in Pasadena,
is growing it in her basement.
♪ She's the little
old lady from Pasadena ♪
You know, the Beach Boys.
Oh, yeah, exactly!
Anyways, she's like this sweet
old little, granny pothead.
Oh, I love it!
Oh, baby, wait till you
hear music on this shit,
it is unbelievable.
Oh.
"Hansel, we're off to spend the
weekend with the Stiltskins,
"keep an eye
on your sister,
"love, Mom and Dad."
It's great because I have
nothing better to do.
Gretel?
Gretel!
Oh, I see
what you mean.
Yeah, you see how those three
notes right there are forming a chord?
Is that what
they're doing?
It's awesome,
huh? So high.
Oh, yeah!
What you guys doing?
Dude, We're
watching music.
Hmm, oh,
watching music?
That's cool.
Unrelated question, uh,
what are you smoking?
Ah! It's called
Black Forest.
Um, what like the cake?
Cake?
No.
No, not just,
not just any
cake, guys.
From, uh,
Black Forest cake.
Okay.
Delicious maraschino cherries,
trapped between layers and
layers of dark chocolate cake.
Cherry filling.
And Bavarian cream.
Oh, Bavarian cream!
Uh, speaking
of which, uh,
you wouldn't happen to have
any Black Forest cake,
would you, Hansel?
No, I thought
you guys had some.
Oh, dude!
I know!
What are we
gonna do now?
You know what?
I'm pretty sure, we got some
gingerbread cookie mix in the kitchen.
Gingerbread.
Gingerbread man, I haven't
had those since I was a kid.
You can make a whole army of gingerbread
men, to fight your munchies.
Whole army, dude?
You can ask 'em anything,
but, they won't
tell you a thing.
Huh?
Never mind.
We'll get
gingerbread men.
Come on.
Stoners.
Got it.
Sweet.
It's a mix.
Wait, so we have
to make it?
No problem, we got
everything we need.
Except, more
Black Forest.
Dude.
Dude.
How about, I make
the gingerbread cookies,
while you go
get more weed.
Dude!
Dude.
Dude.
"In pan," okay.
Uh, yeah, um.
I understand you have
some weed for sale.
Sorry, you really
gonna have to speak up.
Uh, I hear you're
selling weed.
Again, you're really
gonna have to speak up.
Weed.
"We need?" What do you need?
No, uh, weed!
Weed?
Police!
Oh, shit, no!
Police!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, oh, Jesus!
Police! Police!
I'm just fucking with you,
come on in.
Well, come on.
It's now or never.
Come on, go,
come on. Whoa.
Jesus.
Here you go, dearie, just a
little bit of Black Forest
over here in Pasadena.
Oh, um, the Black Forest,
that's in Germany, right?
And they say American education
is just gone to pot.
Should we smoke some?
Oh, um, actually I was
just hoping to buy.
Hmm...
You're not gonna just let a little
old lady smoke all by herself?
Uh, no, I guess not.
Oh, it's some
smooth pot.
Not so bad, huh?
Ain't it great?
So, um, did you
just move here?
Well, actually
very recently.
In my line
of business,
I like to move
pretty sporadically...
So, um, speaking of which...
Witch?
Yeah, yeah
speaking of which,
like, how did you get into
the growing business?
I love to get high.
Speaking of which, you got
to have the munchies.
Oh, yeah, big time.
I've got some sardines,
won't just take me a few
Okay.
Oh, what about that
gingerbread over there?
Don't touch my
gingerbread house.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
Cool.
Mmm, that's nice.
Mmm, that smells good.
What is that?
Sweet butter, with
11 herbs and spices.
Jesus, what the fuck?
Let it simmer, otherwise
you're gonna bruise.
Oh!
Okay, uh, Miss Agnes.
Look, I get it,
you're lonely, and the weed's
got you all horned up,
but, I got a girlfriend.
You smell good.
Almost even good
enough to eat,
but, I think I'm really have
to just wait a little while.
Wait, waiting,
waiting is good, yeah.
Wait, how long exactly
are you thinking,
cause, I gotta get back,
she's waiting for me.
You know everything's gonna cook,
in its own, sweet, beautiful time.
Okay, um,
what if I like,
just let you lick my junk,
but, that's it, nothing else.
What if I want
to eat your junk?
What you mean
like, swallow?
Okay, that's different.
Um, but, I don't
wanna Watch.
Okay?
As you wish.
Oh, my God!
So, where's
the stoner genius?
He went to get more weed. Weed?
Him? No, I don't buy
that for a second.
You know, you could
be a little nicer to him.
Why would I do that?
Because, he's my boyfriend?
Oh, yeah, uh...
"Speaking of which..."
What is it exactly
you see in that guy?
He doesn't judge me.
How long is it gonna be ready?
Fifteen minutes.
Oh, shoot,
we're out of milk.
We can't have cookies
without milk.
You could call Ashton, and have
him pick some up on the way back.
Good idea.
Why?
I told you not to eat
the gingerbread.
You ate the gingerbread.
Please, please!
Please let me go, I swear
I won't tell anyone.
I swear to you.
Please let me go.
Nah, I wish I could,
but, I still
got the munchies.
Damn, they look really good.
Thanks.
Smell even better.
Ash back with that milk?
No, and I've left him,
like, a dozen messages.
You don't think he got
arrested or anything, do you?
No.
He must have just smoked up and
forgot where we live. Whatever.
You aren't gonna post that, are you?
Um...
There's a life outside of
the Internet you know?
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
"Oh, God," is right,
and delicious.
Here's some meat,
you sweetheart.
Ash, why haven't
you call me back?
Hey, watch
where you're going.
UP yours, lady.
What did you
just say?
Excuse me, I would like to apologize
on behalf of my little brother,
he should think
before he speaks.
Yeah, he should.
And please take into consideration
that he's only five years old.
Yeah, only
five years old.
What he meant
to say was,
blow it out your pie hole,
you nasty ho-bag!
And up yours
again, lady!
Manny, where's Ashton?
Oh, shit,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, you gotta chill out.
What's going on?
I'm looking for Ashton,
he's not home,
and he hasn't answered
any of my calls or texts.
Last time I checked,
my boy was a pussywhip.
She always so intense?
Oh, yeah, she's got major control
issues when she's not stoned.
She's totally
killing my buzz.
I was thinking
the same thing.
We keep
thinking alike.
Hello, still
standing here.
Right.
One minute.
What do you want?
Manny, where's Ashton?
Tsk, didn't I take
this quiz already?
Really, Manny? Really?
All right,
have one, baby.
Mmm, baby,
that felt good.
You're fuckin' sexy.
I fuckin' love you, bitch.
Manny, focus!
Please.
No, I haven't
seen him.
Thanks for
friggin' nothing.
He did call me
last night, though.
What did you talk about?
He wanted
Agnes' address.
Agnes? Who's Agnes?
Oh, she's this sweet
little old lady, man.
But she's got this killer...
Black Forest High?
Baby, that's what
We're smoking right?
Yeah that's right
baby, damn!
You got a good-ass memory,
mamacita.
Focus, Manny.
Okay, uh...
I don't know, he's probably
smoked the fuck out.
And he's just crawling
in front of her house, man.
I warned him, that's some sick shit.
Mmm!
Text me her address.
Tell her Manny
sent you, okay?
All right, where
were we, baby?
Come here, oh!
Where you been?
Have a life.
All right,
see you guys.
Can you take me
to Pasadena?
What's in Pasadena?
A little old lady.
Hello.
Mr. Woodsman, there's a
police officer on the phone,
he says he needs to speak
to a manager right away.
Oh, thanks, Sam.
Hello, Officer,
this is Norm Woodsman.
APG&E, District Manager,
what can I do for you?
Well, yes, we are
missing a van.
Thank you.
Kevin, what happened to you?
Now I really need to make sure
you girls come back soon,
and you tell all of
your sorority sisters.
Oh, we will.
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Agnes.
That's me,
how can I help you?
I was wondering if you've
seen my boyfriend, Ashton.
Is he missing?
Yeah, he came by here to get
some stuff and never came back.
Oh, no, I would definitely remember
such a tasty, pretty young man.
But Manny told me
he gave Ash your address.
Oh, well, I'm sure
he's gonna turn up.
I've looked everywhere, guess I'll have
to go to the police now, thank you.
Oh, hey!
Yeah but I...
I'm sure he's gonna show up.
Why don't you just come on in,
and we'll just talk about it.
So kind of you.
It's the least
I can do.
Just make yourself at home.
Thank you.
What's your name, dearie?
Gretel.
That's German.
That's where I'm from.
Now, here we go,
here we go, here
we go, here we go.
Just a little bit of tea, will
make anything feel a lot better.
You know,
I just don't understand him.
Why won't he call me back?
Boys will be boys.
Come on, you need to really have
your tea before it gets cold.
Do you have any sugar? Surely.
One or two?
Two please.
For the love of God...
What?
Eh, just a little knock,
I'll be right back.
It's probably just
my brother, Hansel.
Just keep a little
bit of an eye on her.
You must be Hansel.
What took you
so long?
Nearly had to go to Colorado
to find a spot.
Or you could have
just parked in my driveway.
Your driveway, yeah, okay.
Would have been easier.
So has she seen Ashton?
No.
That's definitely
gotta be cold by now.
Let me just put on
a fresh new pot,
it will only
take me a minute.
Okay.
We should
really be going.
It will just
take me a minute.
I'm sorry, I need to find my boyfriend,
not sit around drinking tea.
Gretel. Look, I'm really
just trying to help.
She's just under a lot of stress
from looking for her boyfriend.
I think I just need
to take her home,
but, thank you for your time,
we're sorry to have troubled you.
There's no trouble.
I love having
young people around.
Thank you.
You know it'd be nice, if you could
be a little more supportive.
You're adopted.
Good boy, Franz.
I met your girlfriend.
She's very beautiful,
and so young.
It's just a curse,
growing old.
Fortunately for you,
you don't have to.
Mmm, this is better.
So, let
me get this straight.
Your boyfriend went
out to get something,
which you won't
say what it is
and then he
didn't return.
How long ago
was that?
About 24 hours ago,
right, Hansel?
Yeah, uh, I mean,
give or take an hour.
What were you two
fighting about?
We weren't fighting.
He went out to get some stuff,
and never came back.
Would that "stuff"
happen to be marijuana?
What makes you say that?
Because, one Ashton Crawford
has racked himself up
quite a few frequent
flyer points
in our misdemeanor
marijuana program.
So? He's still missing.
Come on, Hart, this is
a waste of time
out looking for some
burned-out pothead.
What about
the old lady?
Guys, I mean, come on, aren't
you at least gonna go,
you know, talk to
this woman?
I mean, isn't it a felony
to be growing marijuana?
Well, it depends on
the amount
and if there's
an intent to sell.
Well, I mean,
she's selling.
Really?
Did you buy some?
No.
You?
Did you see her sell
marijuana to anyone?
No.
Did you see any
marijuana plants?
'Cause you want us to
bust a senior citizen
for possession of a drug
with intent to sell,
but yet, you don't
have any evidence.
But Manny said that she was...
Sorry. What?
Sorry, excuse me,
Manny?
Is that, like,
the local drug dealer?
No. 'Cause if you
wanna name names
or drop locations, then we might
have something to talk about.
I don't have
anything to say.
It's kind of what
I thought.
Let's go, Hart.
Hold on.
Give us the old woman's
address, okay.
And if we get time
we'll stop by, we'll ask a
few questions, all right.
Hart, you got to
be kidding me.
Now, let us know
if he turns up, okay?
You know, and if there's anything
else you fine citizens need
please don't
hesitate to call.
Because, after all, we are
here to serve and protect.
Good night.
See, they didn't care
just like I said.
So, what do you
wanna do now?
How is that shit?
I killed
a bumblebee today.
How will we...
Gangster!
You! Yin and Yang,
what the fuck
you all smoking?
This amazing weed
we got from Manny.
It's new, it's called
Black Forest High.
Manny said, he's dropping
the other stuff.
He did, huh?
Yeah.
Tastes like shit
compared to this.
Tastes like shit.
Costs, like,
twice the price.
Fuck that.
The high is like,
twice as nice.
Shut the fuck up.
Give me the fucking joint.
We came to the
decision earlier today
that we are not gonna be sharing any of the...
Oh, yeah you will be sharing.
Yeah, man,
have a toke.
Well, everyone does.
Yeah, we all do.
Give me
all that shit.
What?
Empty your pockets of all
that Black Forest shit.
Maybe my boys won't
fuck you up too bad.
Huh.
Where the fuck
is Manny?
Our bad.
Look here...
- It tickles.
- It tickles?
I mean, I can tell.
Shit.
Get lost, baby.
Now!
Carlos.
What's up, man?
What bring you out
to the Valley?
It's time to get
paid, fool.
Yeah.
Sabes que compadre?
I actually, haven't been moving
as much product this week.
You know,
things are rough
when rich Valley kids don't
have enough money for weed.
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't know what the fuck your saying.
What I do know,
that you're moving
that Black Forest shit.
So, why don't
you hand it over.
Come on, man, I actually sold
out of all her weed, man.
Her weed.
Her weed.
Her fucking weed.
You sell her weed?
'Cause if you're selling
her weed on my turf,
that makes it
my fucking weed.
His weed.
Get this fucking bitch.
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.
Look what I found.
Now, wait, that's
Agnes' money, man.
I got to give
her something.
Oh, you got to give
her something.
Why don't you
give her that.
You tell that fucking puta that she
wants to push her shit on my turf
she's gonna have to fucking
pay like everybody else.
This fucking shit, this ain't
nothing but a down payment, bro.
So, when she tells you or
gives you some fucking lip,
you look her dead in the
fucking face and you tell her,
Carlos said, "He's gonna
come to your casa villa rasa
"and fuck you up personally."
Man, but she's just this
little, sweet grandma, man.
Oh, little grandma,
little...
I will eat that little,
tiny thing like that.
That's perfect, bro,
the way I like them.
She could spit
her dentures out.
Suck my dick.
Well, yeah, man, I got it, man.
No.
You don't got it.
You're gonna tell her exactly what
I said, word-for-fucking-word.
You got that?
Yeah.
Yeah, man.
I got it, man, don't worry about it.
It's cool, I'll tell her
everything you told me.
What the fuck are you
still doing here?
Ain't you
a messenger boy, now?
Yeah, yeah, I am.
Fake little ass shit.
That's what he said.
Well, I hope he's got
a really big dick.
You just don't
get it, do you?
Carlos will hurt you.
I've seen him and his homeys tear a guy
apart for being short on his cash.
Like, tear his ass apart.
Blood and shit
was everywhere.
How many homeys?
When he means
big business,
he could show up with like,
four or five badass pendejos.
Then I think I might,
need you to help me.
No.
No, no you can't
ask me to do that.
See, Carlos' got
a long memory.
He will hunt me down and he
will eat me for breakfast.
You know what I'm saying? Hmm.
Sounds like
my kind of man.
Cookies?
Here, please, have
some cookies.
Um, what?
Cookies.
Can I use your phone?
I just wanna do
a little text.
Okay.
Do you spell "faggot"
with one "G" or two?
Oh, shit!
Okay, I think we're just
gonna go with two "G's."
Now, why don't you just
eat your little cookies.
No, no, no!
No, no! Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit, I'm dead.
Oh, shit, I'm dead.
I'm dead!
No, we're dead!
We're dead!
No, you were right
the first time.
You about done?
Yeah.
Did you get them posted
at the school? Yeah.
Well, then what about the park?
Yeah.
In the mall?
Gretel.
Look, I've posted them everywhere
we've talked about, all right.
There's nothing
we can do at this point.
I mean, we just
have to wait.
Okay?
Take me by that
old witch's place.
I wanna talk to her.
No.
No, it's not
a good idea.
Why not? Because she can have
you arrested for harassment.
I'm not harassing her. I'm...
I'm investigating her.
Oh, okay.
And I guess, the Nazis were just
instituting a simple relocation plan.
Screw you, Hansel.
No, I mean, you're my
sister, it's kind of gross.
Oh.
Damn.
That Black Forest bud is...
Whew!
That's powerful, man.
Where's my phone?
What? No, no, no, bitch.
Faggot!
Fucking faggot?
What the fuck?
This bitch wants to play
games with me, huh?
Octavio? Hey!
Do you wanna get up now? Jorge?
Open up, bitch!
Gonna try and take
Carlos' share, huh?
Excuse me?
Oh.
I was looking for
some old lady.
You got some old lady
living in here?
No, no old ladies here.
Fuck Manny! I'm gonna
kill that pendejo, man.
All right, mamacita,
let me ask you something.
You ever heard of something called
the, uh, Black Forest High?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Doesn't ring a fucking bell.
Motherfucker.
Check out the coffee table,
guapo.
You know, maybe
it's just me...
But I don't like it
when no pretty-ass bitch
tries to play me
for a fool, hmm.
'Cause this don't look like
no grow-house I ever seen.
What's a grow-house?
What's a grow-house?
Where is your crop?
It's in the basement.
But you don't
wanna go there.
Oh, I wanna go there.
But, see, right now, you're not
gonna tell me what I wanna do.
So, why don't you take
me down to the basement.
There you go.
No, no.
You open the door.
Were getting the whole
50 cent tour.
As you wish.
This used to be
a funeral home.
That's where they
they'd embalm the bodies.
Octavio!
The last tenants made this
room into a wine cellar,
but I don't really
drink wine.
And...
This is where I let my little
darlings spread their roots.
Damn, bitch!
What the fuck
kind of place is this?
An old bomb shelter,
that I just recycled
for my needs.
Damn, mama, how did you get
these plants to grow so big?
Magic,
and of course, just a little
bit of my own special brand...
Of...
Fertilizer...
To get it going.
Speaking of which,
I know just
what it needs
to make it
the best crop...
Even
Yeah.
Check it out, homes.
We hit the fucking
jackpot.
I'm gonna harvest it.
There're not ready yet.
They look
fucking ready to me.
They might be big
but they're not mature.
Huh. Well, guess what?
I tell you when
to harvest.
I don't think so.
Franz!
You know,
there's a little rumour
going around.
Manny said,
that you told him
you wanted me to
take my dentures out
and do something
nasty to you.
Now, could that be true?
Fuck you! You crazy
fucking bitch.
Fucking is just not
on the menu tonight.
Mmm.
What a bummer!
Ahhh!
Ugh!
There's got to be something.
Manny. What the fuck!
All magic comes at a price.
It's gonna be okay.
Franz! Franz, Franz,
Franz, Franz, Franz...
Franz? Franz.
Sit now.
You're gonna be
a very, very good boy.
You're gonna
be a very good...
Boy.
Now, who wants
a treat?
Franz, would you like a
little treat, my baby doll?
Good doggy-
Are those fingers?
Waste not want not, right?
You're gonna kill me,
aren't you?
Well, since you're
here hanging out,
you might as well enjoy
and get a little stoned.
Oh, that's so badass.
Help!
Help! Somebody help me!
No one can hear you.
Help!
No one can hear you.
I'll be back in
a little bit.
I just got to go
clean up a zombie.
And, I'll come check in
on you later.
Good morning, Norm.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Uh...
I don't know if this is
important or not, but...
My son came home
stoned last night.
Well, after we finished
discussing it...
He told me about this new strain of
marijuana that some old lady is selling.
Did he say where?
Same area as
my power surge.
Thank you.
Manny's missing?
Yeah, no one's
seen him since...
Aren't you that little guera who was
all up in his grill the other day?
Same one. Maybe you two should
have taken me seriously.
Yeah, you're right.
I was thinking about going to the police...
Don't bother.
As soon as they see Manny has
a record they'll blow it off.
"Serve and protect"
my ass!
What do we do?
I know where they are.
But, it's gonna
be dangerous.
Definitely illegal.
Somebody's gonna
get hurt.
The car's right here.
That's the house.
We can't just go in there
all guns blazing, bitch.
We needs to case
the place first.
Find out if she's home or no.
That kinda shit.
Smart.
You have done this
before, right?
Well...
Don't tell me we're
popping your B&E cherry.
B&E? Damn, girl.
Breaking and entering.
Yeah, well
I guess we are.
Okay, well since you're the
expert, what should we do first?
We needs to find out
if she home.
I mean,
it looks empty to me.
Yeah, but she's an old lady.
You can never tell if those bitches are
home just by looking at the house.
Yeah.
Okay.
Listen, to me, huh.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go knock
on the front door
pretending like I'm gonna
buy some weed.
While you do the B&E action in the back.
Okay, and if she's not there?
Then I'll join you in the back
and We'll break in together.
Cool.
Oh, uh...
I must have
the wrong address.
Were you looking
for someone older?
Yeah, does she live here?
Did someone, umm...
Did someone tell you to
ask her a little
sweet little old lady?
Yeah, he said.
Ah.
Honestly!
Once you're a day over 40 they think
you got one foot already in the grave.
Uh, you know I used to
think that way, too.
Until I dated
my last boyfriend.
And he was, like, 42,
and I was like "Dude,
"you way too old for me"
But, then he, like,
bought me all these fly
clothes and took me
to really fancy places like
the Cheesecake Factory...
And then I realized I could
totally be into older guys.
As long as they can still get it up.
You know what I mean?
Cause if you ain't getting dick,
you ain't getting nothing.
You know what I mean?
Would you like to
come in for some tea?
And by tea I mean
would you like to come in
for some weed?
Hell, yeah.
Come on in.
Oh, that smells
so good.
I hope you like it.
It's my very,
very special blend.
Oh!
Hey, you have pretty skin.
Yummy, yummy,
delicious hair.
You like it?
Oh, my cousin Rosa...
The one who does hair,
not the one in jail.
She makes her own
special hot oil blend
and sells it online.
I could totally hook you up
if you'd like.
I like.
I like very much.
Cool.
You gonna have
some of this?
I think, I want some.
Oh, I'm gonna have some.
Is it hot in here?
Or is it just the weed?
That's a very pretty brassiere.
Where did you get it?
Oh, you're gonna love
this story.
Okay, Gretel,
you can do this.
What is this place?
Hey.
Someone out there?
Is that you, Ash?
Ash?
No, I'm Octavio.
Octavio,
is Ash with you?
No, it's just me.
And I came here
with two other guys.
Where are they?
I don't know,
probably dead.
This bitch,
is gonna kill us all.
Fuck.
Fuck, you're dead,
I'm dead...
Dude, pull your shit
together, so I can help you.
Where are you?
She got me locked
up in a damn cage.
Where? Which path
did you take?
I don't remember.
They all look the same.
You're not very
helpful, are you?
Maybe if I whistle,
you can follow the sound.
And then she opens
the door for me,
and tells me to come back
real soon.
Little did that bitch know,
I had his one and two others
just like it up in my bag.
Holla!
You smell delicious.
Vanilla.
Yeah, good nose.
Octavio?
Yeah?
I need you, to keep whistling or
something, so I can find you.
I'm sorry,
my mouth is dry.
Did I tell you,
I can read palms?
Really?
Yeah, my grandmother taught me.
This is your lifeline,
it says,
your gonna live a long,
long,
Jesus!
Oh, what?
I never seen a lifeline
like this before.
Enough about my life.
Let's talk about your life.
Where's the key?
You don't have them?
You didn't say
anything about keys.
She keeps them on the hook
at the bottom of the stairs.
The ones here?
The ones that lead up
to the main room.
Be right back.
Promise?
I promise.
Is this,
is this your lifeline?
Uh-huh.
Agnes,
what are you doing?
Tasting the merchandise.
Uh...
Well, I only...
Ever kiss,
just so you know.
I find that,
hard to believe.
With other chicks, I...
Me too, sweetie.
Oh, hell, no!
Oh, shit.
Gretel!
Bianca!
What the fuck?
I thought, somebody was killing you.
Shit,
I just killed that bitch.
Shit.
Don't come any closer.
Don't tell me what to do, bitch!
I just killed someone...
Really,
you don't want to do this...
Oh, my God!
What did I do?
I did
what I had to do.
Come on!
Come on!
Carlos!
Bring her to me!
Gretel?
You home?
Please don't be home.
Oh, thank you.
Very thoughtful of you.
Oh, oh, no.
Oh.
Oh, shit.
A Skittle.
"Taste the rainbow."
Everything's gonna be okay.
It's gonna say,
everything's gonna be okay.
Gretel?
What do you know?
Ritter.
What? Remember that girl
from the other day?
Oh, what girl?
The one with
the missing boyfriend.
Oh, yeah.
The cute little redhead.
Guess who just showed up
on the missing person report.
Her boyfriend?
The one and only.
Maybe, we should go
check out her story.
That's a good idea.
Uh, where are you going?
Priorities, Hart.
Priorities.
Get me one!
How did we get in here?
Fucking Carlos nabbed me.
Don't know, what happened to you.
The plants, they...
They held me, trapped me.
This place
is fucking haunted.
Not haunted.
More like enchanted.
She's got to be
some kind of witch.
Here, I thought,
you were just,
these pissy little potheads.
Where's Ashton?
He's kind of trying
to help me
turn back those nasty,
cruel hands of time.
What the hell,
is she talking about?
Who knows? She's always
doing this crazy-ass talk.
That doesn't
answer my question.
Well, it should.
What have you done
with my Ashton?
You sucked the life
out of him?
His youth.
They just give me
all my youth back.
Is he dead?
Duh.
Got to go.
Com paw-
Franz, take care of this.
Make sure they all feel nice
and warm and fuzzy.
Carlos?
Giddy up.
Hansel?
What a great surprise.
I was under the impression
that you didn't partake.
I'm sorry,
have we met?
Oh, my mother,
my mother has just said,
the most wonderful,
wonderful things about you
and your lovely sister.
Oh, okay.
Is she home?
Uh, I need to apologize.
Apologize?
Yeah, for Gretel.
For harassing her.
My mother knew that,
she was just very concerned
about her boyfriend.
Her boyfriend's name is...
Ashton.
Ashton, yes that's right.
It's, it's no big deal.
Really though?
Because, I mean, I thought that,
she'd be kind of pissed off
after Gretel, like,
stopped by again.
She did stop by again,
didn't she?
No, I haven't seen her,
since the other day.
Oh, okay.
I thought...
Thought what?
Well,
something Gretel said,
indicated to me,
that she was going to be
stopping by again.
It's obviously mistaken.
Come on, I would love
to make you some tea.
I'll make you some tea.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were just, um
You... You're just so, like...
Awesomely beautiful.
I just wanted to capture
the moment, I guess.
"Awesomely beautiful"?
Yeah, I mean,
you have like perfect
perfect cheekbones,
perfect chin,
you know, perfect...
How sweet of you.
Can I see?
There's, there's got to be something
wrong with the camera or something.
I don't think, there is
anything wrong with the camera.
No, honestly, honestly...
Give it to me.
It just doesn't do you
justice, and I, uh...
Give it to me.
Uh...
Oh, the camera
never lies, does it?
Carlos!
Bring him to me!
Fuck!
Come on, you zombie asshole!
Never send a zombie
to do a woman's job.
Oh, fucking crap.
You got to be kidding me.
Evening, ma'am, uh...
Oh, good God,
I'm not having a good night.
How are we gonna
get past the damn dog?
Stop moving so much.
I can't think.
Well,
moving helps me think.
I can't think of anything.
Miss Hudson told me
I was a Greek tragedy.
Damn, if that
bitch ain't right.
God! Greek tragedy!
That's it, Bianca.
What's it?
What if this hellhound thing is like
the Cerberus in the story of Orpheus?
Say What?
You know, the Cerberus. The three-headed
dog that guarded the gates of hell.
Orpheus sang to it,
and put it to sleep.
Okay. I got this.
I sing all the time.
♪ Blast, blast, blast
motherfucker tried to dash
♪ So I capped them
in the ass with my gal'... ♪
Stop, Stop,
stop, Stop!
What?
That's not music.
Yeah it is.
You just don't know it.
You can't sing.
Okay.
Since, you think, you
know, all about music
and Cerberus and shit.
Then go ahead.
Why don't you sing?
♪ Rose, Rose, Rose red
♪ Will I ever see thee wed
♪ I shall marry at my will
Seriously?
♪ Rose, Rose, Rose red
♪ I/Villlever
see thee wed
♪ I shall marry at my will
♪ Said Rose ♪
Oh, you're awake,
my little pretty.
What are you doing?
Fixing dinner.
Unless, you're a virgin.
What?
Of course,
I'm not a virgin.
You're a virgin.
It's gonna call for a
little bit of extra magic.
Crazy bitch.
What are you doing?
I left Skittles, so I
could find my way back.
Oh.
What?
Okay. I kind of had the
munchies and I kind of...
You ate my trail?
It's not like you said, "Hey,
bitch, don't eat the Skittles.
"I'm laying down a trail." How
the hell was I supposed to know?
Damn! Why would you eat Skittles
that were lying down on the ground?
Excuse me,
maybe I was
running from zombies, freaking out
and I needed some comfort food.
It's this way.
Are you sure?
No, but I'm tired of you bitching
about Skittles. Come on.
You're so screwed.
Oh God! Oh, God!
Help!
Help!
Come on.
Help!
Hansel!
Gretel!
Gretel, come on!
I can't get the straps off!
Hurry!
Oh, what the fuck!
What the fuck!
My pretty little boy,
my pretty, pretty little boy,
we have a little bit of
unfinished business.
Are you all right?
Are they going
to be all right?
Yeah.
Thank God for Kevlar.
That's true.
You kids are gonna be okay?
Yeah.
I think so.
I think
she's dead.
Oh, yeah.
Good night, kids.
I should have trusted you.
And I should have...
Believed you.
What have we here?
Oh! Aren't you
the pretty one.
And look at that collar.
Somebody loves you, huh?
Do you have any ID?
No, you don't.
Well, how would you like to
come home with Uncle Norm.
And just until
we find your family.
You are just so pretty.
Yes, you are.
We're gonna go to
my nice, sweet home.
