Do you think
we did it this time?
Yes.
I think we did.
Gi, your sister's
on the phone.
Okay.
I'll be right there.
You know,
I managed to stop.
I know. I'm gonna stop.
I'm gonna stop.
Dr. Hughes
is gonna smell it.
Hey. Just calling to wish
you luck at the doctor's today.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm good. I'm excited.
What's wrong?
I just can't stop thinking
about them.
About Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
'Cause they were
the last thing I saw.
Geen...
My love,
we need to leave.
Um... James says
we have to go.
- Okay. I'm coming.
- Okay, okay.
Well, I'm thinking about you,
and I love you.
I love you more. Bye.

James.
- I'm fine.
- I know.
Okay.
You're more nervous
than I am. Stop.
I'm being nervous so you
don't have to be nervous.
James, I need to get out.
Come on, Gi, you got this.
Come on, please.
In... out.
Baby, I can't do it.
Baby, get me out of here. Please, please,
please. Get me out. I can't do it.
I'm right here.
I'm right here.
There you go.

And now, look left.
And right.
And try to keep your eye
open for about 15 seconds.
Okay.
I see no
reason not to do this.
I'll restore optical
properties of the right eye.
A corneal transplantation,
iris reconstruction
and intraocular
lens implantation.
But you definitely
can't do the left?
The optic nerve in the left eye was
severely damaged in the crash.
It won't transmit the picture
to the brain.
But I'll be able to see
fully with my right eye?
You'll be able to
count fingers on day one.
On day three,
20 over 200.
By week four,
you should be at 20/50.
That's terrific.
Come on, it's more than terrific.
That's amazing, huh?
That is amazing.
That is the best news!
There's no risk to Gina,
though, in the operation?
The only risk
is that it won't work.
Yep. And if it doesn't work?
We'll just go back
to how we were.
It's fine, James.
How soon can this happen?
Well, there is
a waiting list.
But as soon as a date becomes
available, I will call you.
Hi, Gina.
- Hey, Lucy.
- Are you ready to practice?
- I sure am. Are you?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Jill.
- James is not with you?
- No, he's not. Hey, Ginger.
He's out with some friends
from work tonight.
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

- Hey. Hey, hey. Come on.
Where'd you learn
to talk like that?
Let's play again from the top.
Come on.
I don't like this song
anymore.
- Okay, what song do you like?
- Nothing.
You like nothing.
Okay.
- I like to double-dutch.
- That's more like it.
You like to double-dutch. Get over here.
Teach me an E-chord.
Where's an E-chord
on this thing?
One, two, three.
That's an E.

Time to practice.
Please repeat after me.
Ladies first.
Good job. Now
it's the guys' turn.
Hello?
Gina.
Baby! Gosh!
- What?
- I got scared again tonight. Stupid doors.
You need your big, bad James
to come home and protect you.
Oh, yeah.
- Who'd you go out with?
- I went out with Richard.
- From work?
- Yeah.
Get out of here. Stop.
You wanna make a baby?
Huh?
You wanna make ourselves
a little baby?
Mm-hmm, yeah.
- I want a baby.
- I want you to fix the balcony doors.
Those fuckin' doors, huh?
You know what?
You're right.
I'm gonna take my pants off,
and I'm gonna fix those doors.
Go... Yeah. Go take off your pants,
baby, and then go fix the doors.
- I am.
- That's perfect.
Where'd I leave
my tool kit? Huh?
Where's my tool kit?
Why do I love you so much
when you're so terrible?
You do love me,
don't you?
I just want to go to
sleep right here.
Does it ever bother you,
having to take care of me?
No.
It makes me
feel special.
Hey, Gina.
It's Daniel.
Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- You?
- I'm good.
I just got here,
so I better get going.
- All right. I'll see you around.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- I saw you talking with Daniel earlier.
- Yeah.
It really is a shame you're blind, because if
you could just see the size of his package...
Oh, my God.
I mean, FedEx could
not handle that shit.
- I'm talking width and length.
- Stop it. Karen!
- Shh!
- Think back to your childhood.
- Did you ever see any male horses?
- Shh. Stop it.
- I'm serious.
- How do you know?
Shit. Gina, honey, there's
blood on your leg.
- What?
- I'm gonna get you a towel. There's blood on your leg.
Did it happen in the pool?
Karen?
Lucy?
Hey, what's wrong?
Sweetheart,
what's going on?
Mom's gonna have
Ginger put to sleep.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.
She can't put her down if there's
nothing wrong with her, sweetheart.
She says she can't cope, with
me and the baby on the way.
Hey, my love, I'm home.
What is that?
What's that?
Who's your new mama?
What's Ginger
doing here?
I adopted her.
- You what?
- Jill was gonna put her down.
- Why?
- She's having a baby.
What do you mean? You can't put a dog
down because you're having a baby.
I know.
That's what I said.
What's the matter?
You got your period.
Ah, shit.
I'm sorry.
- Don't say sorry.
- I am.
Don't...
say sorry, okay?
I am.
You know what?
Let's go out.
Come on.
- I'm okay. Please? Oh, my God.
- Come on.
Hello, Beijing!
- Come on, dance with me!
- I am. I am.
I'm dancing.
I'm dancing, I'm dancing.
- That's not dancing. Come on.
- I am!
Whoo!
I hate dancing. I look stupid.
We all look stupid.
If you could see yourself,
you'd see that we look stupid!
What's the matter?
Gina!
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
- Excuse me. You're hurting me!
- Baby, come here.
There's a fucking pool right there.
Okay, darling?
There's a pool right there.
Just stop.
Come here.
Please put that away.
I've got it out now,
haven't I? Come on.
- Where are the stalls?
- To the right.
James?
James?
- Looking for someone?
- My husband.
- What does he look like?
- He's tall with blue eyes.
Yeah, he, uh, he has...
- James?
- Gina. Gina.
- Bye!
- Where were you?
- I was just here.
- No, you weren't.
I just turned my
back for one second.
Can I just go home, please?
Just take me home.
Okay. Come on.
- I'm gonna have a quick shower, okay?
- Okay.
What the...
What the hell?
Oh! Hey, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop.
- What happened?
- There's dog shit and piss everywhere.
- Unbelievable.
- Come on, baby.
Ginger? Come on. It's okay.
Don't hurt her.
Why would you do that?
'Cause I just fucking put
my sock all in her piss.
We should've taken her out.
It's not her fault, James.
One's full of shit.
One's...
Gina, it's not funny. Stop laughing, Gina.
It's not funny.
It's not funny.
I'm sorry.
- Can you get that?
- Yeah.
What is this?
- Hello?
- Is this Gina Lloyd?
- Yeah.
- This is Dr. Hughes' office.
I'm sorry to call so late, but we've
had a last-minute cancellation.
I'm gonna be right
here as soon as you wake up.
- Okay?
- Okay.
I love you.
I'm gonna have you
count backwards from 10.
10, 9...
Gina!
- Girls.
- Who wants ice cream?
Gina!
Hi. Hello, Gina.
Hi.
- All right. I'm gonna take the bandages off.
- Okay.
Now, this is gonna be just
a little uncomfortable.
Okay.
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay.
Okay. Open your
eyes now, please.
Can you see
my hand?
Mmm.
Kind of?
I think... I-I think so.
I don't know.
Open the curtain.
This may
feel a little bright.
A little more.
Gina?
Geen.
Gina?
You know what?
No. It's okay.
We tried. Hmm?
- Promise?
- Yes.
I love you so much.
Yes.
- Yeah?
- I can see.
Food tastes
different.
Well,
it's hospital food.
I have taken that
into account.
Can I ask
a silly question?
- What?
- Have you seen yourself yet?
Why not?
You're beautiful.
Really, really beautiful.
You look different than
what I had in my head.
- Disappointed?
- No, I didn't mean it bad, baby.
- I know, I know.
- I just mean different.
Yeah.
Good "different."
Dr. Wanchai,
please dial extension number 278.
These are antibiotic drops.
You need to put these
in your eyes
five times a day
for the next 15 days.
- This is important.
- I know. I'm listening.
- Sorry.
- These are steroid drops.
- They need to be taken every other hour.
- Mm-hmm.
We'll taper the dosage
as we go, okay?
Yep.
- Blue are the steroids. Yes?
- Yeah.
Now, take
your wife home.
Watch your step.
Babe.
- Huh?
- Baby, look at all the colors.
I know.
I know.
- That's blue.
- Mm-hmm.
It's just there.
It's right there.
What do you want to do? Where do you
want to go? What do you want to see?
- I just want colors.
- Lots of colors.
All right.
I know the perfect place.

Hi, Ginger.
Hey, say hello
to Mommy.
Hi, baby. Come on.
Come here.
Oh, you are ugly.
What?
I just for... I forgot
what my name looked like.
Okay,
what's the matter?
It's just, this is not
how I imagined it, is all.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I just feel like I knew
everything before. You know?
Now I don't.
I've got a surprise.
What?
What is that?
Tickets. Flights.
South of Spain.
I got us the exact same suite
we had on our honeymoon.
Are you serious?
Then we get a train to
Barcelona to see your sister.
Stop.
- And then Luca.
- Stop it.
- And Ramon.
- Wait, can... Can I even travel?
I spoke to the doctor.
Everything's all good.
We're clear to go.
We leave in three days.
Huh? I know!
Look at me.
Look at me.
- I am.
- Come on.
I am.
What?
Hey, what's wrong?
Hang on. Just one second, please.
One second.
Do you want to do
anything different?
No, it's not you. It's not you.
It's just...
It's just...
We'll be
in touch soon.
- You'll call me?
- Yes.
- Kitten, what are you doing?
- I'm coming.
I'm just taking
my drops.
Come on.
We gotta get going.
Okay.
- There we are.
- What is that?
Are you gonna buy me one?
Yeah?
You want one?
Blue is
my favorite color.
- Do you remember it, the grass?
- Hmm?
- No?
- No. I remember that sound.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And voilà.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Just here.
This is great.
Thank you.
Uh, all right.
It's beautiful.
- It's not the same.
- What's not the same?
- The room.
- It's the exact same room we had on our honeymoon.
- No, it's not.
- It is.
I know you asked for it,
but they didn't give it to you.
You couldn't have seen it.
You were blind.
What's it have to do
with anything?
- How could you tell this is not the same?
- How could you tell?
- I was here, remember?
- Oh, okay.
It's the exact same room.
Trust me.
- It's exactly the same.
- It may look the same, but it's not the same.
You're not even a little
bit scared up here?
It's fine.
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa. Okay.
How many would you like?
One each or one to share?
- We're gonna share.
- Two. No, one each.
No. We only had one
last time.
- Two, please.
- One.
Two. Two.
Gina!
Gina!
Oh, my God.
I send you away and that's
what you come up with?
Who was the guy
you were talking to?
- It was Ollie.
- He must be European. He likes a bit of white.
Yeah.
He really does.
- Who is he?
- He and his wife are here on their honeymoon.
They're in the room
we were in last time.
- You can't let it go, can you?
- Ask the manager.
- Go on. He's right there.
- Why would I ask the manager?
- Ask him. He's the manager.
- No, no. No, no.
- You could just ask him.
- We're fine. I already asked him.
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.
And?
It's not the same room.
When were you gonna tell me?
- Truthfully?
- Uh-huh.
Never.
Well, I forgive you.
Jesus Christ.
They can't see us,
can they?
Maybe they like
being watched.
Ai-yi-yi. Come on. You
don't want to see that.
Mmm.
- Talk to me.
- Shh. Just feel me.
Untie me.
Just untie me.
- Let me get my hands on you.
- Stop.
Oh, fuck.
You can feel me better
when you can't see me.
Come on, just untie me.
Let me have one hand.
You get to feel
what it's like.
Come on.
What's the point of wearing something
like that if I can't see you?
You don't need to see, baby.
Use your imagination.
Oh, God.
- Come on.
- I just want to get my hands on you.
What do you think about
when you jerk off?
- Hmm?
- I think about you.
- Always?
- Always.
Huh?
What do you think about?
- I think about you.
- Just me? And what else?
- Just men.
- Really?
Yeah,
just bodies and dicks.
And dicks. So you
don't think about me?
- Come on. Stop that.
- So you do think about other people?
- Are you trying to trick me?
- No, I'm not trying to trick you.
- Hey, baby...
- No, don't turn this around.
I feel stupid enough as it is, okay?
Please. Take it off.
Take it off.
I've had enough.
Take it off.
I feel stupid now.
You make me
feel so stupid. Fuck.
Untie me.
Take it off. Okay, come on.
I've had enough. Please.

You think so?
Luca, do we look alike?
Hang on.
I think you're right.
Carla, you can't say that.

can say whatever I want.

he's an angel, he's your sister's.

- How?
- Stop putting it in her ass.
I mean it.
What?
- You can't...
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe you said that.
- I'm sorry.
- We don't do that, Ramon.
- You don't... Oh, come on.
You should. It's great.
Ask Carla.
Oh, my God.
- Does it worry you, James?
- What?
Mmm. I don't know.
Now that Gina can see, she might find
someone better-looking than you.
This is gonna
be a long night.
Okay. Be good.
You still wanna go
to the tunnel tomorrow, right?
Yes. You keep asking.
Why you keep asking me?
- I want to make sure you want to go.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- You think about it a lot?
- I think about it every day.
I know.
I think about it too.
It's just... just go and get
it over with, you know?
Yeah.
Oh, my God. I don't
know how to do it.
It's perfect.
What?
No. She doesn't want
to wear that dress.
It's a dress... I don't know,
like a little mermaid.
You like it?
Please?
- Please?
- Now!
I'm a little mermaid
with my mustache.
Glub, glub, glub,
glub, glub.
Glub, glub,
glub, glub, glub.
- Just watch me, please.
- No one's watching you.
Because if you not watch
me, I can't leave.
Could you please get in
the shower so we can go.
- I don't want to be waiting for you.
- Just one last dance.
♪ So I'm going

Adios. Gracias.
Adios, mi amor.

Wow.

- He's not in there, is he?
I'm wearing makeup.
I'm wearing makeup!
You look hot. You look really...
Oh, my God, you look hot.
Sexy. Very sexy.
What? You're saying it
like it's a bad thing.
No, it's not a bad thing. I've never seen
my wife in a dress like that before.
I guess
it's not really you, huh?
- We don't really know what me is.
- Oh. I guess we don't really know who you is.
- You wearing any underwear?
- Of course.
Señor! Señor!
Cigarro!
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, so I heard
you work in insurance.
Yeah,
I work in insurance.
That's why we're in Thailand.
I got a promotion.
- Is it as boring as it sounds?
- Yes, it is. Fuck you very much.
Hey, hey, hey. We should

What? No. They don't

- No. Take her in.
- I'll be right here.
- You're not gonna come?
- No. Go and have a good time.
- I don't want him to come.
Good-bye, James.
Yes!
- You missed out.
- What? What?
Crazy, man.
That was unbelievable.
Why aren't you laughing?
I'm just kind of...
Yeah.
A pussy!
Pussy!
- Teach him how...
- He doesn't know how to do that to a woman.
- He likes to be very proper.
- I can't hear you.
Oh, hi.
You know when you said earlier,
now that my wife can see,
am I worried that she's gonna
run off with another man?
No, don't listen to me.
- No... W-Well, you said it.
- I was joking with you.
Hey. Hey!
This guy
just grabbed my ass!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Gina, Gina, Gina.
- What do you think you're doing?
- What's going on?
This fucking guy grabbed my ass!
What is your problem?
- Calm down.
- No, you... you calm...
What, 'cause he didn't
grab your fucking ass?
- You okay? You okay?
- Thank you, Ramon. Thank you.
- Gina, what's going on?
- What do you mean? I told you. It's fine.
Ramon
took care of it.
Anyone else want to grab my ass?
He's fine with it.
- Hey, you! You wanna grab my ass?
- Gina, stop it! Stop it!
Is there any need to humiliate
me in front of your sister?
- I humiliated... It's my fault?
- Yeah.
Dimelo otra vez.
Say it again.
Say it to my face.
Can you hit me?
Come on, mamacita, I'm gonna fuck you.
Okay, you keep the blankets
for yourself.
Ready?
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Hey, Luca!
Seemed a lot bigger
when we were little girls.
Hey, hey.
Get back!
Muere.
- Come on. Join us.
- What'd he say?
He says, "Come in."
No, no, no.
Muchas gracias, Luca. No.
- What'd he say?
- He said his mommy and daddy bathe together.
Yeah, I bet they do.
- What's wrong?
- You don't think it's a little weird?
- Hey! Hey!
- What? What?
Having a bath
with Luca.
I think it's fucking weird
you even saying that. Eew.
Hey. Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We leave for the airport
in an hour.
I think we should find
somewhere else to live.
Why? What?
But I'm happy here.
I mean, I... I like it here.
I don't want to move.
I mean, it's home.
- Do you need a hand?
- Uh-uh. I got it. Thank you.
- Yeah? You sure?
- Hold on. Please? Just wait.
Want something else?
Hmm? Hmm?
- Come on.
- You should take a shower.
That's it?
Let me get my hands on you.
Why don't you untie me?
What's the point of wearing something
like that if I can't see you?
- Use your imagination.
- Oh, God. Fuck.
What do you think
about when you jerk off?
I think about you.
- Always?
- Alway...
What do you think about?
- I think about you.
- Just me? What else?
- Just men.
- Really?
- Yeah, just bodies and dicks.
- And dicks.
- So you don't think about me?
- Oh, come on.
So you do think
about other people.
Are you
trying to trick me?
- No, I'm not trying to trick you. I'm not.
- Hey, baby.
Don't turn this around. I feel
stupid enough as it is. Okay?
Take it off.
Obviously, a low sperm
count decreases the odds
that one of your sperm will
fertilize your partner's egg.
Yeah.
James, I'm afraid it's unlikely
you'll be able to father a child.
Wow.
You and your partner
could consider
using either a sperm donor
or maybe even adoption.
Oh, boy.
That's disgusting!
Lucky, heel!
How you doing, Gina? Oh, it's,
uh, Daniel, from the pool.
Yeah, I recognized
your voice.
- How you doing?
- I'm good. Thank you.
Interesting choice,
the pink handkerchief.
- Wait a minute. Can you see me?
- Yeah.
No, I had surgery,
so...
- Wow! That is fantastic!
- Yeah.
What is that like, being able
to see all of the sudden?
Um... it's... it's...
I mean, it's incredible.
Wow, that amaz...
That's good for you.
Thanks.
Would you like to
get coffee right now?
Oh, I... I, um...
- I can't. Sorry.
- That's okay. All right.
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yes, I'm sure I'll see you at the pool or the park.
- Nice seeing you.
- Yeah.
Lucky!
Come here, boy!
Come on. Come on.
Good girl.
- What are you making?
- Your favorite... tom kha gai.
- Are you ready for a surprise?
- I hope so.
Wait! Don't look yet.
Close your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Wow.
You're blonde.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- You don't like it?
- No, it's good. It's just different.
I'm just, you know,
not used to it.
- Is that a bad thing?
- No, it's...
- It's different.
- Just different?
I'm just, um, you know...
just a bit shocked, that's all.
Okay.
- What's this?
- The place I'm looking at tomorrow.
What about me?
I'm working.
Well, if I like it,
we can go back.
Ah.
All right, miss.
Tell me some things
you saw today.
Um... I saw a rainbow
in a puddle.
- That's nice.
- It was the first time I saw it since I was a little girl.
Here.
Let me do that.
I went to the dog park
with Ginger,
and there was this really
butch-looking shepherd,
uh, but he was wearing
this pink handkerchief
and Ginger
decided to lick his balls.
- Licked his balls?
- Yes.
- What did the other owner say?
- Um...
she didn't say
anything.
I guess she has
a sense of humor.
You haven't forgotten that work event
we've got coming up next week.
Mm-mmm.
Got it in my calendar.
Oh, Miss Organized. You got
yourself a calendar, huh?
What do you expect?
It'd be good, though, if you might
wear something a little less...
Less what?
Just something a little more, you know...
It's a work event.
- Baby, it's all for you.
- I know.
I just don't want the whole department
going, "Hey, check out James's wife."
Did you love me more
before?
- When you were blind?
- Uh-huh.
I could ask you
the same thing.
No, I asked you.
Why blonde?
So,
what do you think?
Oh, I think
it's amazing.
- I just have to bring my husband back.
- By all means.
It's a great house
for a family.
One, two, three.

- What happened to your eye?
- It's just sore. I'm gonna go see Dr. Hughes tomorrow.
- Gina!
- It doesn't look very good... What?
- Come here!
- Guess what.
- What?
- I found our house.
- What do you mean?
- I mean I found our house.
- I thought we spoke about this.
- Yes, we did, but...
- What is it? Jesus.
- Look at it.
Gina, don't. I'm gonna
get a garbage bag.
It's fine.
I'm gonna freeze it.
Carla and I
used to save their feathers.
Okay,
you can relax now.
There seems to be
a low-grade rejection.
What does that mean?
There's no infection,
so it should be fine.
But I'm gonna prescribe you
a higher dosage of steroids.
But rejection, I don't...
I don't like that.
Don't worry. It's just
a slight inflammation.
Baby, it's your sister.
She's on the phone.
He said there's
nothing we can do.
We just have to wait.
And I keep taking my drops.
I just don't think you should keep relying
on these drops if you're getting worse.
Maybe my eye is rejecting
the transplant.
That happens. I could
be one of those people.
Listen, I don't know
what else to do.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm... I'm worried, you know.
I know. I know.
- Will you call me later?
- Okay.
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you too.
Okay. Bye.
What do you think about?
- I think about you.
- What else?
- Just men.
- Really?
Yeah.
Just bodies and dicks.
Dicks, huh? So you
don't think about me?
- Oh, come on.
- So you do...
I know full well the operation was
a success. I was there. I did it.
All right, so... so what? My eye
is rejecting the transplant?
Are you taking
the correct dosage?
- Everything you told me to take before.
- Okay.
- Maybe it is the drops.
- No, I-I doubt that.
Okay.
Do you want to check?
I'll send them down to
pharmacology, if you wish.
- Okay.
- I'll give you some samples in the meantime.
Use them until we figure
out what's going on.
Oh, come on, Gina.
Fuck.
Baby, what are you doing?
- Come on! I'm sitting down in the taxi, waiting.
- Just give me a second.
Come on, honey.
What's the problem? Huh?
Forget what I said.
Put on whatever you want.
- Give me a fucking minute!
- I gave you a fucking minute.
- Please, just leave me alone!
- Just get dressed.
I can't fucking see!
Oh, my love.
Stop.
I'm sorry.
Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please forgive me, baby.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me. Come on.
Come on. We're not
gonna go out, okay?
All right? We're not gonna go out.
We're gonna stay right here.
- I want to go.
- No, we're not going out. No, no, no. Okay?
No, no.
Come here. Come here.
My beautiful girl.
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah, that's it.
- I can't...
- We've dealt with this before.
And we were happy then.
Come on. It's okay, honey.
Don't do this. You're okay.
You're okay.
Gina!
- Something wrong?
- I don't know. I think she's just overheating.
- Come here, girl.
- Just trying to cool her down.
She's okay.
It happens. She's old.
What's wrong
with your eye?
Oh, um...
I don't...
I don't know.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
I'm just feeling a little
stressed right now.
She's my baby, you know.
Why don't we do this? My
apartment's only a block away.
Why don't we take her there, we'll get
her cooled down and get her some water.
- Yeah?
- Okay. Thank you.
- Here. I'll carry her.
- Let me take him.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- How's she looking?
- So much better. Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Gotta be careful with these dogs in this heat.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- She's a sweet girl.
- Yeah. I worry about her.
God.
She's old now.
- How old is she?
- She's 11.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
New for me though.
I think
she's good to go.
Yeah.
Yeah, she's good.
You just move in?
Uh, no, actually,
I'm moving out.
- I'm going home in a couple of weeks.
- Nice.
If we don't see you,
thanks.
So,
what do you think?
I think my wife has got very good taste.
- I'd like to put in an offer.
- Fantastic.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Where have you been?
I was worried about you finding
your way home in the dark.
I'm sorry. I was at the park with Ginger.
She got sick.
- You gonna come in here?
- Yeah.
What's going on with Ginger?
Is she okay?
Yeah. She just overheats.
She's okay now though.
You might want to spend a little
less time worried about the dog
and a little more time
thinking about yourself.
I got some news.
What?
Your husband put an offer in on that
house that you love down by the river,
and that offer
was accepted.
- What?
- Yeah.
It's ours.
- Oh, my...
- Yeah.
You know, thought it might
be a nice surprise.
That's amazing.

- Hello?
- Gina, hi. It's Dr. Hughes.
The results came back
and you're right.
There are inconsistencies with your drops
you brought in and the ones I gave you.
Gina?
Yeah,
I-I understand.
It's very important that you only
use the samples that I gave you.
- Come in and see me.
- Okay.
Yeah, thank you.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, Gina.
This your apartment?
Yes.
- When were you last here, ma'am?
- A couple hours ago.
- Hey.
- James, I'm at our apartment. We've been broken into.
- Are you okay?
- I'm with the police.
All right, look, I'm gonna
come home straightaway. Okay?
All right? Gina?
Ginger?
Ginger, come on, baby.
- Come on. Where... Have you seen my dog?
- We didn't see any dog.
There's a bell.
You'll hear her.
Ginger!
Come on, baby.
Come to Mama.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Ginger, come on!
- Ginger, come on, baby!
- Gina!
Gina.
Come on.
Uh, Gina, this is Daniel.
Daniel, this is my wife, Gina.
Hey, Gina.
How are you?
- Yeah.
- How are you?
Daniel walks his dog in the park.
Doesn't he, boy?
Every day. He said he's gonna
give us a call if he sees Ginger.
- Okay.
- Gave him my telephone number.
- Yeah.
- Can you help me find her?
- Mm-hmm.
- It was nice meeting you.
- James.
- Pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you. And I got
your number, so if I see her...
- Please do.
- See you guys later.
- I'm not lying to you. Please leave me alone.
- You're humiliating me.
That was the exact same dog that you
described to me with a pink fuckin' bandana.
You think I believe you're out with Richard
every night when you come home plastered?
Why do you pretend
you don't know each other?
I might be stupid, but I'm not blind.
I could see you knew him.
- Why are you lying to me?
- Because I'm attracted to him. Is that what you want to hear?
Gina.
- Hey.
- How are you?
Did you guys
find Ginger?
No.
I-I tried to call you.
I'm sorry.
James? It's you?
Uh, yes, it is.
Just gonna get a drink.
What the fuck.
Hey, baby, come here.
I have something
to tell you.
Mmm?
I'm pregnant.
Hello.
No one is available
to take your call.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Daniel,
it's, uh... it's Gina.
I'm not sure when you leave. I
just wanted to, um... to see...
Hello?
Are you upstairs?
Gina!
Yeah.
I'm in the baby's room.
I'm gonna head out for a...
Oh! Oh-ho. Hey.
Hang on.
Let me give you a hand.
- Hang on.
- No, I got it.
- Yeah, you got it.
- I told you, James, I have it.
Watch out.
I'm going to head over
the apartment,
finish picking up the rest of the
boxes, see what else needs doing.
I'll see you
at the concert.
- I thought I was gonna drive you.
- No, Jill's picking me up.
Oh, Jill's picking you up,
is she?
- Yeah. Lucy and I have to be there early.
- Okay.
- Make sure she drives nice and safe, okay?
- Okay.
All right.
James.
Yeah.
Gina?
Gina.
"I found your dog.
I saw that white man
tie her to a fence.
I was scared
to write to you sooner,
because I knew
you would want her back.
I love her
and want to keep her.
I really believe in my heart
that she belongs to me.
When I look at her,
she looks back at me,
and that is called love.
I know that you are missing her,
but I cannot give her back.
It would make me too sad.
Sorry."
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome on stage,
performing a song
they wrote themselves,
Lucy and Gina!
