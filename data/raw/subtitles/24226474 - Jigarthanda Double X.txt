1973
KOMBAI FOREST
Oh, Goddess Sethukaali!
Oh, king of the Kombai Kanai!
Who left you like this, bleeding to death?
Sir, we didn't expect this to happen
on your first day at work.
Including this, Shettani has killed
twelve elephants in the last three days.
By now, all the tusks
would've crossed the seas.
Oh!
Sir, please don't smoke a cigarette here.
You're risking a forest fire.
This is not a cigarette.
It's pot.
Including rangers and many other lives,
Shettani has taken 65 lives.
Greetings, officer!
You must save us and our village,
like a God.
We, the Kanakal people,
have no connection with Shettani.
Our people are being tortured
in the name of investigation.
Wait.
I'm very well aware of what's happening
and what must be done.
Hereafter everything will fall into place.
Don't worry.
I've arranged a feast. Please eat
to your heart's content before leaving.
- Okay?
- Thank you, sir!
Who did this to you?
The police hit me.
Sir, he's the forest ranger's assistant.
He must have accompanied
our officer last night.
But coincidentally, he was absent.
Sir, the officer ordered me to go back
to Kanakal last week itself.
Nonsense! Is this how you beat them?
Is this how you investigate?
What do you think? Will striking in this
manner compel them to tell the truth?
A police officer's beatings
must either get the truth out of them...
or take the life out of them!
Duty, dignity, and discipline...
has gone for a toss.
The invincible Shettani in the forest
and the ruthless police here
are terrorizing the lives
of the Kanakal people.
{\an8}Why don't you find a solution for
all these atrocities, Mr. Good Cop?
After all it was a cop who died.
You enjoy the feast!
No, sir.
A good cop alone is not enough.
We need a savior!
And he is on his way!
MADRAS
Jeyakodi will be here in some time.
His fan club members are inside.
And so are the Youth Wing students.
Ensure no fight sparks up.
{\an8}- Be alert. Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Darling Lourdh. Wait, I'll come.
What's up? You seem to be
cock-a-hoop today. Watch out!
Kirubai Arokiyaraj,
Sub-inspector of Police,
Madras City of the Tamil Nadu state
of the Indian country!
I'll head for police training, become
the SI, then I'll wear the uniform,
and then directly ask your dad
for your hand in marriage.
Wow! Every word that you said
was so sweet...
Praise be to God.
WELCOME EVERYONE
KUMARAN JEYAKODI
You son of a wretch! Stop, come here!
Quiet. What if they really come?
Thank God they didn't hear you!
You haven't changed a bit.
{\an8}You're going to be an SI.
Be a little manly.
Yeah, right! Manly?
I somehow managed to pass the SI exam
and got the posting order.
But I am unable to stop being
the coward that I am.
The day before yesterday,
while crossing a butcher's shop,
when I saw the severed goat's head
and the blood,
I got dizzy and had a seizure attack.
I fell off the scooter, hurt my knees,
and started bleeding.
Are you going to keep falling
the same way after you become a cop?
Why do you even want to be a cop?
Stop pulling my leg, Lourdh.
I don't look at joining the police force
as just another job.
The last image of my father I remember
is him in a police uniform.
His last words were, "Do what you must
but become a cop somehow".
Since then, all I know is...
Police! Police! Police!
Oh! Is that so?
Two college groups are
about to clash over there.
Go, stop the injustice,
and uphold the law and order.
I shall do that once I become a cop.
You carry on now.
"Police! Police! Police!"
Whatever! My team performance is up next.
You stay safe here. Do not entertain
anybody who tries to talk to you.
They will offer cookies and candies,
but don't fall for it. I'll be back!
Boys!
Someone has just attacked four
of our college friends. Come on, hurry!
Move! Please move!
Oh my God! Sir!
He is a timid fellow, sir.
He'll faint at the sight of blood.
Does this look like the work of someone
who'd faint at the sight of blood?
He is a murderer!
You just ruthlessly killed
four rich students in broad daylight
on the college campus!
You are a certified cold-blooded killer!
He's an Agmark, ruthless murderer!
Sir, please! He is a cop!
If that innocent girl's tears
don't question your conscience,
then you are not guilty.
Let me ask you one last time.
Are you innocent?
Forgive us, sir.
You have opened our eyes.
Your Honor, we committed the murder.
That's all, Your Honor.
Awesome, Mr. Vendhan!
You're a true king of this soil!
THE END
Oh, this youth is springing over!
And the new age is here
Wonderful, sir! Wonderful!
{\an8}Tomorrow is going to be
a festival in all theaters.
{\an8}A star who sings the people's tune
{\an8}"People flood into theaters,
thanks to Jeyakodi!"
Tomorrow's headlines must read that.
Once that lady is back from Delhi,
she must announce me
as the next Chief Minister!
- He has sculpted each and every frame!
- True.
- Sir, there's an issue.
- What is it?
In the south, Minister Karmegam
and Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club members...
have targeted you.
They have threatened not to release
your movie in theaters there.
They are forcing theaters to release
the actor Chinnah's Mohana Ragam.
"SINGING NIGHTINGALE"
CHINNAH MESMERIZES YOU IN...
MOHANARAGAM
Chinnah, my foot!
Who in the hell is he?
A dummy! Using that dummy,
he's ruining my life!
That Karmegam!
"Mohana Ragam shines bright
all over Tamil Nadu."
Courtesy... Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club.
We must get rid of Jeyakodi for good.
I will be the CM for the next 15 years.
And you'll be the top star
of the Tamil cinema.
Sir! Wonderful, sir!
Fabulous!
Including Coimbatore,
Tirunelveli, and Ramnadu,
we got only seven screens in the South.
Chinnah's movie is running
in all other theaters.
And in Madurai...
In Madurai?
Zero.
Zero?
Who rules there?
The leader of
the Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club!
My boy!
MADURAI
KARIYA TALKIES
Instead of saying,
"The Delhi trip ended well",
it'd be apt to say,
"The trip to Delhi has begun well".
All these years, I shed my blood and sweat
to serve Tamil Nadu.
Henceforth, after the elections,
I shall shed my blood and
sweat to serve the entire nation...
as the Prime Minister of India.
You all gave me unwavering support
and showed a great deal of dedication.
When I resign after three months
and select one among you
as the new Chief Minister...
- Long live the next CM Karmegam!
- Long live the next CM Jeyakodi!
Come again! Next CM Jeyakodi?
First, ask him to become
the present top star!
Quiet! Please be quiet!
I heard your movie bombed, Jeyakodi.
Looks like there was no crowd at all
in the South zone.
- Looks like your movie has no screens.
- This is a conspiracy, madam.
Karmegam's men roughed up my fans
and made sure my movie got no screens!
Moreover, the head of my Madurai fan club
was burnt alive!
Excuse me! Mind where you are
and also mind your words!
You're new to politics.
Jeyakodi, it is not for your acting
or political knowledge.
I let you reach a high position
in the party.
All I need is the influence you have
on the people.
Every ticket bought for your movie
must be converted into a vote.
So, don't stay an actor forever.
Try becoming a politician too.
Madam...
{\an8}the party members wish to honor you
with the Sengol.
{\an8}- Karmegam, lend a helping hand.
- Madam.
Long live the next CM Karmegam!
Long live the next CM Karmegam!
He is coming. Move aside.
Sir!
Sir, it has been chiseled.
Piece of art!
You are a damn good sculptor!
Sir, call from Jeyakodi sir in Madras.
Something urgent.
Now what?
You want Karmegam dead?
You think they will spare us
if we kill him?
What else must be done?
We must make him a nothing!
{\an8}His strength, backup, and hold...
{\an8}are those four rowdies
in four different towns.
Those four rowdies must die!
Especially that guy in Madurai!
Yesterday, I almost decided
to kill myself.
The pain of insult is worse than death.
I want them dead!
Karmegam must perish!
I must rule Tamil Nadu!
I've never seen you cry before.
You're the reason behind my success,
my resurrection, and every damn thing!
I will never let you down, my brother.
Let's finish them off!
I'll do it!
I will hunt them down!
I'll freaking hunt them down!
Do it!
Kill all four of them!
Strip them and chase them away!
He wants the Sengol?! My foot!
Oldie, here you go.
Give me the cards.
Looks like you sold all the stuff
you took last time.
First murder, blood thirst,
a police dream, and family love.
All of them perfectly match
the criteria you're looking for.
Each one of them was filtered
and carefully chosen.
Choose the best, sir.
Who's Ravi here?
Who's Somu?
- Sir, that's me.
- Come.
- Sir.
- Who's Madhan?
- Sir.
- Who's Kirubai?
Hey, Kirubai! Sir's calling you.
- Are you Kirubai?
- Yes, sir.
Come with me.
- I'm praying. What's the matter, sir?
- Hey!
You committed four murders.
Drop the act. Come on.
- Welcome, buddies.
- Sir!
Shining white tooth powder!
Shining white...
Is it a full moon day?
Today's earning is as good as gone!
Jothi sir!
Jothi sir, I saw him take off
to Katchatheevu.
The auction will be carried out
only by his henchmen.
Next, 18 pieces.
Double X. Final price, eight lakh rupees!
Each of you has passed
the SI examination,
but fate landed you in prison.
We have arranged someone else
to turn in for you,
and also the necessary formalities
for you to join the police are done.
Sir!
Enough. Give it here.
Now hear me out carefully.
We have a few risky
and secret murder missions
to be executed for the government.
If you four can individually
execute that perfectly,
{\an8}then this job is yours.
You can join the department
the very next day.
Stay back if you think you can do this.
And if you're opting out,
then go back and rot in prison.
So are you ready for this game?
You got time till I finish this joint.
Police!
Sir! Save us!
We are ready, sir!
What's up, my dear people!
Jothi sir, please don't.
- You know he's not in town...
- And you think I'm here like a coward?
This is not cowardice but pouncing
when the time is right.
You morons learn the trade from me
and go against me?
Go and tell your boss...
{\an8}that his ex-boss came and
took over Madurai from him!
{\an8}I shall rule this place hereafter!
I'll conduct the auctions.
He wants the throne!
Hey!
Pick your poison.
Read the names.
Maari.
All the mills in Coimbatore and
lottery centers are under his control.
Kadhar.
Kadhar bhai. Ramnadu is completely
under his control.
No smuggled goods can enter there
without his knowledge.
Periyasamy, aka Periyavar.
He operates lodges, harbor contracts,
and sand mining.
A prominent figure
in Tirunelveli politics.
Where is that Madurai guy?
Your boy.
Even if he keeps pushing away,
there is trouble that
keeps finding its way to him.
My boy will be here
once he is done and dusted with it.
The leader of the Madurai famous
Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club!
The most notorious, dangerous,
and merciless one in this group.
A beast!
And you've got his name in the lucky draw.
Congratulations.
Jothi sir...
it's a trap.
Read it aloud.
Allius Caesar.
Boss, it's been so long. Isn't it?
You're done for!
What are you all waiting for?
Chop him into pieces!
Hey!
Jothi sir...
how about we watch a Clint Eastwood movie?
Get him!
CLITIS TALKIES
TRESPASSERS WILL GET THEIR JAWS BROKEN
Bring Jothi sir's wife and son.
Boss, get up.
- Come on.
- Get up.
There's nothing to worry about. Go.
Caesar...
I did out of haste. Let go of me.
You were the apple of my eye once!
Pick it up.
The apple of your eye?
Where are the fireworks?
Is she here to light it up?
With her fiery eyes
She lights me up every time
So, come to me darling
Give me the love I can't reach for
She pulled me closer
And shook me up to my core
Hey, if you are not entertained
Stop being a pain in my head!
Hey, if you are not entertained
Stop being a pain in my head!
Everything I do is successful
And I never miss the target
Where are the fireworks?
Is she here to light it up?
With her fiery eyes
She lights me up every time
With her honey-sweet words
She mesmerizes me
With her sharp and cute teeth
She devoured me nice and slow
Hey, if you are not entertained
Stop being a pain in my head!
Hey, if you are not entertained
Stop being a pain in my head!
Everything I do is successful
And I never miss the target
I saw her sneaking out carefully
I acted aloof, didn't fall for her
And held my pride
But she swooped in like an eagle
Struck me like lightning and flew away
So gorgeous that everybody admires her
Don't get stuck in the mud
Do get eaten up by the mud
Don't just live in your dreams
And waste your life
So don't hold yourself
There won't be any consequences
The more friends you make
The more you rise
So, go and explore all your options
Pump up and go beyond limits
Looking at the sky
Makes me move like the breeze
And with the beats
I perform till the earth cracks
Lord Jesus!
Caesar...
you set the floor on fire!
Hey!
My boy Caesar danced like a movie star.
What do you say?
He has definitely got moves.
If he were as fair as me,
he could've become a hero.
It's so sad that he's dark-skinned.
Caesar...
Do you hold a negative opinion
of dark skin?
One must be fair-skinned
to make it to the movies.
A dark-skinned hero will soon come
to put an end to you all!
- Caesar...
- You can be one.
Why don't you become the first
dark-skinned hero of Tamil Nadu?
You will be the hero!
- Boss...
- Come on!
Who? Me?
Get lost!
- Wait. Wait.
- Caesar.
Everyone else can laugh
but if you laugh...
I'll skin you alive and turn you red!
Do you find it funny
when they call me a hero?
Caesar, that's not why I laughed!
I wondered who'd produce
a movie with you as the hero.
He is filthy rich, you fool!
It's actually the four of them who
fill half of the government's treasure!
Fine! Everyone's got money...
but what about story, screenplay,
dialogues, and direction?
You need someone to do that, right?
You cannot force anyone to do that.
Imagine the current Pan-Indian cinema...
with a dark-skinned hero like him.
Go ahead, picture it.
Don't you find it funny?
How dare you talk like that about Caesar?
We need a star to play our politics.
So, find one before you kill this fellow.
Hey!
What was that English word you just said?
Pan-India.
Movies that release all over India.
"Pandyaa!"
Can't you keep your mouth shut?
Don't die at his hands.
A Pandyaa Movie!
HUNT FOR A GREAT DIRECTOR!
LOOKING FOR A DIRECTOR WITH GOOD STORY
So, they serve meat every day, Brophew?
That's why you look beefed up!
Enough of sucking it.
Now leave, Bruncle!
Hey!
You are all I got. For two weeks, I was
wondering how to approach that group.
This is the only way.
So, you want to narrate him a story...
and make you his director.
Then within a month,
you will kill him.
And then you will become a cop.
- Correct?
- Correct!
Before you lose my respect,
get lost, Bruncle!
- Duraipandi, he's calling you.
- God!
"Making you my servant!"
My biggest mistake was
making you my servant!
- The status of this family doesn't...
- Cut!
Cameraman sir, let's shoot the next shot
from here.
Shot 3. Take 4.
Sound! Action!
"The status of this family
doesn't lie on this couch."
Doesn't lie on this couch...
Cut! Cut!
- Cut.
- One more!
One more.
- Shot 3. Take 5.
- Sound!
Sound.
Action!
Action.
- One more!
- One more.
- Roll camera!
- Roll camera.
- Sound!
- Sound.
- Action.
- Action!
- Sir, let's take a ten-minute break.
- Okay, sir.
Cut-camera-sound-rolling-action.
Ten-minute break!
Brophew...
The director is playing the veena.
Which means he's angry.
You better leave!
Wait.
Brophew...
Cut-one more-roll camera-sound-action.
Then hit and throw tantrums
at some people around you.
I have mastered direction.
Now all I need is a story to narrate.
- Do you have one?
- A story?
Bruncle, get lost!
So, you don't have a story of your own?
- Give me your director's story.
- No! No!
- I'll fix it and create a new story.
- Duraipandi!
Sir...
You! Who are you?
Sir, I'm director Duraipandi's assistant.
- An assistant to Director Duraipandi sir?
- Yes, sir.
Rascal Duraipandi!
- You're fired!
- God!
- Get out!
- To hell with him!
Brophew...
When do we start to Madurai?
Dear future directors, who are here
in Madurai,
Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club
welcomes you wholeheartedly!
Are you the director of the Pandyaa movie
starring India's first dusky hero?
{\an8}Come, narrate your story,
and win our Caesar's heart!
Hey! Look at that oldie. He's wasted!
Move him aside.
Brophew...
not even the local famous festival
sees this much crowd.
Bruncle, my story
"The New Wings of the Caged Dove"
{\an8}will reach the hearts of millions!
WHO ARE YOU?
After many struggles,
your seventh sister...
gets married.
You weep and weep...
You weep your heart out, sir.
No. I can't control my laughter
looking at him cry.
Ezhumalai And Eight Sisters.
It has 67 crying scenes for me?
Let go! Let go!
What's wrong
with a sister sentiment story?
Get lost!
"Look at me, O Sculptor!"
"Who's that?"
"It's me. God!"
{\an8}"I haven't sculpted the mouth yet.
Where is the sound coming from?"
"Gopal, I too desire for it..."
Get up!
Next.
"Sir! Sir! Please save us
from all the injustice!"
- "Please save us!"
- We'll save you later.
Oh my God!
Is that him?
Let's leave, Bruncle.
Remember our goal, Brophew!
Keep the goal in mind.
Please let go of me.
I've no connection with Jothi sir.
- Hey!
- You play a snake in this story.
To hell with playing a snake! Hey!
- Come on!
- Sir, sir...
Trust me, animal movies
do good business.
Forget The Caged Dove.
Narrate The Silent Flute.
Sir, you're diagnosed with cancer
and there is no cure for it yet.
Brophew...
many call me a coward.
But it's only now I realize
what it is to be a coward.
- Let's leave.
- Leave?
What about your goal?
Let's come up with another plan.
He's going to rough up everyone,
no matter how good the story is.
First, let's escape from here
before he sees us.
My creative potential is going untapped.
Stop, both of you!
Bruncle, we have no choice
but to show our faces.
Remember Godfather? Now go
and make him an offer he can't refuse.
People are waiting patiently over here.
Why are you in a hurry?
Why are you both barging out?
Who are you?
Come and narrate your story.
I am Ray Dasan.
Tamil film director.
From the school of Satyajit Ray...
in Kolkata.
Okay.
Mr. Allius Caesar...
I was Satyajit Ray's assistant.
One day he called me and said...
"I think you are ready, my boy.
Now go and make your movie".
He blessed me as I left.
I spent a year thinking about
the kind of movie I should make.
One day I got my answer.
So, I decided that...
the first movie I make
must win an Oscar!
There was a Hollywood movie
about a white-skinned don, like you.
His biography was made as
The Godfather I and II.
It won nine Oscars.
In the very same way,
a story of a dark gem,
the son of our soil,
a raw, ruthless, and rustic biopic
of a don!
That's going to be my movie
that will win the Oscar.
Madurai is known for rowdies,
especially Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club.
And the leader of that club,
the great Allius Caesar!
I've heard a lot about you.
So, I thought I'd meet you,
make your story into a biopic...
and send it to the Oscars.
Or that's what I thought.
Luckily, when I came here, I heard
about your "Hunt for a Great Director".
Meet my assistant Duraipandi.
I heard it from him.
So, I stood in the queue to narrate
my Oscar-winning story.
But what do I see here?
The creators and future directors...
are being disrespected, roughed up,
manhandled, and ill-treated!
I hate you all and I don't like this
illicit, illiterate behavior.
So, I got furious and I decided to leave.
And I'm leaving now!
Sir...
Yes, you, sir.
Director Ray Das sir.
- Please come here.
- Yes...
Please come.
Please have a seat, sir.
How dare you sit
on my boss' throne?
No... please. It hurts.
My loin cloth!
- Come here.
- It hurts.
Did you even listen to all
the torturous stories since morning?
Now, look at him.
Don't you see magic in his eyes?
- To hell with the throne! Get lost!
- Please don't...
Okay! Everybody, leave.
We found our director.
The first dark-skinned hero
of Tamil Cinema.
And so you are the director
of that historical Pandyaa movie.
Congratulations, sir.
He plays the mouth organ
when he gets upset.
Let him play.
Okay.
Welcome, director sir.
Atthini... we might die...
but she will still keep haunting us.
Shut up! Stop it with
all the "dying" and "haunting".
- Shut up, you madman!
- Hey!
Whom did you just call a madman?
You have made it a habit!
Stop calling my dad a madman.
I'll chop off your tongue.
What else will I call a madman?
Is this how you talk
to your pregnant wife?
Bruncle, I think you
don't have to worry.
He'll die from all the stress
his wife is giving him.
- Shut up and go inside!
- Here he comes.
Ask what you want to know
and he'll answer.
Okay. Let's start with your name.
Why is your name Allius Caesar?
Mela Kuyil Kudi.
Back in 1960, an English movie
was being shot there.
Oh! An English movie was shot
in Mela Kuyil Kudi?
In Mela Kuyil Kudi...
the shooting of an English movie
took place.
That's when a bull ran amok
and charged towards the hero.
When everyone was scared to stop it...
I swooped in and saved his life.
That English hero gifted me a hat
for saving his life.
I said, "I don't want your hat.
Give me your gun".
{\an8}So, he gifted me a toy gun.
Then he asked my name.
I said, "I'm Alliyan.
{\an8}Any name you call me will bring me luck.
So, give me a name."
{\an8}He said, "I won't change
the name given by your parents,
but I'll give you a new name".
And he named me...
Allius Caesar.
What's your name?
Clint Eastwood.
Clint Eastwood?
Just because a white man shot
a movie here,
he built a theater just to play
that one movie every day.
- How did I marry into this mad family...
- Shut up!
Marrying you was my bad fate!
Your dad tricked me into marrying you!
If I catch hold of him, I will...
Do you hear me?
Hey!
Look here! If you insult my dad...
I will insult yours!
Hey!
Look here.
- You'll insult my dad?
- Yes!
Clint Eastwood came to Mela Kuyil Kudi
and shot a movie.
He gave him a name and gifted him
a toy gun. Yeah, right!
Any more questions or are you done?
Done? Just the name
and how you got it isn't enough.
Biography!
I'll tell you. Come.
Tell them my biography.
{\an8}No! Return my money.
These items are all duplicates.
What's the issue there?
- He says there's a defect in our stuff.
- All duplicates! Return my money.
See, look for yourself!
Now, tell me!
- It works. You want to see?
- Show me.
My ear!
My ear! My ear!
I put one through his ear.
Shall I put one through your mouth?
Clint Eastwood gifted me
a toy gun. "Yeah, right!"
Hey!
It's in good working condition.
Here, this is the toy gun Clint Eastwood
gifted me.
Toy gun?
Sir, this is not a toy gun.
It's an 8 mm camera.
You can use this to even make a movie.
Clint Eastwood left this hint back then,
that you deserve to become a hero, sir.
Muruga, you were right!
Until yesterday, our boss thought
it was a toy gun. Isn't it, boss?
He took Murugan to the theater,
to finish him off there.
He told us it's not a gun.
Remember, boss?
We even used pellets
to check if it was working.
So, shall we shoot?
Shoot?
Shoot whom?
He means film shooting.
Oh, shooting! What do you
mean by, "Shall we start?"
- What about the story... your biography?
- Didn't they just tell you?
The four incidents that he told me
on our way here?
- Is that your whole biography?
- Yes.
And you want to start shooting?
Right away?
- Not right away.
- True.
We'll start once the sun is down.
In the evening.
My men are on their way.
Sir, it is not so easy to write
a screenplay for your biography.
We shall go to Chennai and...
Satyajit Ray once said, "A good movie
will come to life on its own".
So, once the sun goes down...
we can start shooting.
It's not like we are going
to make a movie for real.
Four days in the name of shooting,
and on the fifth day, I'll finish him off.
You'll finish him off, my foot!
He'd have put a bullet through my mouth!
Sir, he's the local inspector.
- He wanted to wish you.
- Best wishes, director sir.
We are eagerly awaiting awesome news.
Director sir, please come.
Meet Kadhar bhai.
Satyajit Ray...
Bhai, he's a legendary director.
A very famous one.
On which of his movies did you work?
- Panther Panjali.
- Ray sir...
Meet Maari and that's Periyavar.
Don't do that. Get up.
If you don't finish him off
by 14th August,
be ready to face the heat
at Pandrimalai checkpost
the next day. DSP Rathna.
Sir! Two cartridges are ready.
- Okay.
- Shall I insert it into the camera?
- Do you know how to do it?
- Yes, sir.
- Do it then.
- Okay.
Shall we begin?
Ready.
Do the honors and say
"Roll-Camera-Action", Bruncle.
Roll-camera-action!
Say cut, Bruncle.
Cut-camera-action!
He nailed it!
That was awesome!
I'm playing a dummy director
in order to become a cop.
But when I said "action",
I felt an emotion inside me.
It was so good.
Wasn't it?
Now that's cinema.
Cinema.
I had goosebumps when
I acted out my first shot.
You know that instant high we get
when we do a liquor shot?
It was the exact feeling.
Once the movie is ready,
{\an8}we must install a large cutout of mine
directly beside Clint Eastwood's,
{\an8}and have a grand worldwide release
this Diwali.
No.
Police!
I'm a police officer!
That DSP set us a deadline of 15th August
to finish him off.
Within the next three days...
I'll finish off Caesar.
I'll kill him.
{\an8}30 DAYS AND 41 ATTEMPTS LATER...
{\an8}Tomorrow the nation will
celebrate Independence Day.
Give me an excellent idea
to finish him off today, Brophew.
Do you still believe that
you can kill him, Bruncle?
I'm pretty sure we will be shooting
this film for the next 25 years...
and surely during that time,
he'll die of illness.
Pardon me, sir.
I was out of station
on the day Jothi died.
I shut my shop that afternoon
and left for a photo shoot.
A ceremony for piercing a baby's ears.
- Okay. You may go.
- Thank you, sir.
Sadhashivam, the evidence
is not solid enough.
I will reschedule the hearing of this case
to the 18th of next month.
MADURAI DISTRICT COURT
Take my dad along and finish your lunch.
- Come on, boys.
- Go and eat.
Hey!
{\an8}Where are you both going?
{\an8}To eat.
{\an8}An action block in the court premises.
And we are going to shoot it.
What's the scene?
I'm going to squash a sparrow.
That's the scene.
MADURAI DISTRICT COURT
See that guy sitting there?
He killed my dad. Finish him off!
{\an8}Go ahead.
{\an8}Hide behind Gandhiji's statue
and start recording.
{\an8}Go!
- Brophew, come.
- Bruncle...
- He must die!
- He will!
Action!
Drive!
{\an8}Brophew, I don't think
I'll have to go to Pandrimalai.
- His story will come to an end today.
- So will ours!
{\an8}You want to kill me? Sounds fair.
{\an8}But you aren't man enough yet to do that.
Come back once you are a man!
Now leave!
Got it?
- That was a dialogue.
- Yeah.
Cut it.
Happy Independence Day.
- It's okay, lie down.
- Sir.
There's no news about one person,
the other is playing a masseuse,
another is a driver,
and the last one
is a cinema director.
How did you filter these four?
Sir, you selected these four.
Come again.
Sir, it was you who chose them.
Correct.
- No, sir. Please.
- I chose them, right?
I selected them, right?
Please... be seated.
Sit on the floor!
Hey.
Guess what this is.
It's poison.
Ever heard of Shettani, the mystery man
who's killing elephants in the forest?
It seems he rubs this poison
on the tip of the spear to kill elephants.
If the elephant escapes even
after the spear hits,
the poison will kill it later.
You four share it among yourselves.
Listen, today is the 15th.
I want them dead by the 1st of next month.
If you cannot finish them off by the 1st,
then wherever you are,
just consume this and die!
And on the 2nd,
the news of your death
must reach me.
If I don't get a message on the 2nd,
then on the 3rd morning,
each and every member of your family
will be hanged to death!
Hope I'm clear. I want them dead!
Now get lost! Also, take him away!
Sir!
He is dead, sir!
Holy...
Sir, Shettani is here!
- Where?
- Over there.
Holy moly!
Who's Shettani among them?
The one in the center.
He is here for his old man.
Sir, give a firing order.
He'll finish us off in no time
and leave our corpses hanging.
Are you ready to sacrifice your life?
Let that old man go.
Sir, you may leave.
Are you sure?
Listen, this stuff is jinxed.
I'll get you another one.
No, no! Cut! Cut!
What the hell is this, Caesar?
What is this rubbish?
We can't show this in a movie.
Sir, if you say "cut" or "one more"
once again while I'm dancing happily,
I'll chop your hands off.
Now go.
Whatever! Just shoot it.
- Rolling.
- Action!
In the city of great Madurai
Is where his flag flies high
So come on, lady
Our hero is ready
Entire Madurai praises him
So come on, lady
Play the beats
In the city of great Madurai
Is where his flag flies high
So come on, lady
Our hero is ready
Entire Madurai praises him
So come on, lady
Play the beats
Bro!
Fire up the crackers
Fire it up
Don't stand idle over the corner
Jump in and groove with us
What are you doing?
Is this my baby shower or yours?
Look at him drinking and dancing!
Damn it!
- Moreover, these two cinema fools!
- Madam!
So, Uncle, how's Shettani doing?
- Dear, this is so unfair.
- Get lost!
Move.
BABY SHOWER
MALAIARASI
Here he comes!
In the city of great Madurai
Is where his flag flies high
So come on, lady
Our hero is ready
Entire Madurai praises him
So, come on, lady
Play the beats
Atthini is too dangerous.
She will come one day.
She will definitely come.
Our Kanakal forest and elephants
are in danger
because of Shettani and
the police force trying to catch him.
And your husband smuggles
and sells the very same tusks.
- Will he ever prosper?
- Never, Dad!
Some spicy chutney here.
Already there's a madman in the house...
and now there are two more!
- Brother!
- Serve.
You look educated. Why don't you make
a biopic of some nobleman?
Why are you making a movie on this
piece of crap, as if he's Gandhi?
Nowadays nobody wants to watch
any nobleman's biopic.
Well, he was noble during childhood.
If it weren't for that
single unfortunate event,
he would also be living like a hunter
in the forest.
Tomorrow is your wife's baby shower
and she's like a daughter to me.
Yeah, right! It's the booze talking.
He shows love only after drinking.
Bhai, just keep quiet.
Listen to me.
He's being unfair!
He says he cares for us, then why
didn't he give us that harbor project?
- He gave it to his men.
- Hey...
- Come on, now. Quiet.
- What he said was wrong.
Get lost!
I won't tolerate anything against you.
Doesn't have any manners.
Talking ill about Periyavar.
Malaiarasi...
what was that unfortunate incident?
Caesar never mentioned anything about it.
My son... Atthini killed him...
Yes... Atthini.
She is very dangerous.
Kariyan was my elder sister's husband.
He was the best hunter in Kanakal.
The elephant is the spirit of the forest.
We, the Kanakal people, had a rule
not to hunt elephants.
Because a Britisher promised him
1000 rupees,
Kariyan took along his sons,
Komban and Alliyan,
and set out to the forest for hunting.
Atthini, are your parents dead?
Fine, calm down.
Go back to the forest.
Go back to the forest.
You let her go?
That was wrong, Alliya.
An elephant never forgets!
We cannot survive if we show sympathy
to animals.
How can sympathy be wrong, Dad?
Komba! Komba!
Komba...
Komba!
Komba!
He believed that it was his
sympathy that destroyed his family.
And that's when he started going
down this path.
He will definitely reform
one day, brother.
I hope your cinema will change him.
I have a strong intuition.
Yes?
Oh my God!
Looks like you're old but still playful!
The baby shower is tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
Hey, you. Leave.
Don't oversleep and be there at 7:00 a.m.
I'll be the first one to gift her
a bangle. She's like my daughter.
Daughter, my foot!
Ray sir!
He was sloshed.
If I had pushed him off the roof,
a murder would've taken place today.
But I suddenly remembered
what Malaiarasi told me.
Above all, she addressed me as a brother.
Tomorrow's her baby shower.
We'll finish him off some other day.
This reminds me of the elephant story
she told us.
Don't show sympathy to an elephant.
It'll kill you one day.
You fool!
Madhan!
- I killed Periyavar.
- What?
Yes, I killed Periyavar.
You finish off Caesar.
- How did you...
- Finish him off soon!
- We'll meet in the force.
- Hey!
Ray sir!
Who is he? Your friend?
Oh, God!
Looks like he hurt his leg!
- Shall I go and drop him off?
- No! No!
No, he's a stranger. He's hurt
and requested directions to the hospital.
I gave him the right direction.
Get some sleep and let's meet
at the function tomorrow.
Okay, sir.
Bruncle...
Just like you said,
a murder did take place today.
Bruncle!
Caesar, I'm sure you'll have twins.
It's getting late. How long will you
keep talking? Start the ceremony.
Hold on, Uncle. Periyavar
will gift her the first bangle.
Where is he?
I knocked on his room door,
but he was still asleep.
- He has a headache. He'll come.
- Wait.
I knew he'd sleep the whole day
for whatever he did last night.
So what if that piece of crap
doesn't attend this function?
Listen to them and sit.
Behave like my husband.
- You shut up!
- Hey!
- He considers you like his daughter.
- Listen to me.
Disrespect him and I'll break your jaw!
Hey, don't insult your pregnant wife
in front of so many people!
Does being pregnant give her
the license to insult elders?!
I want Periyavar to do
the first honors and she...
Caesar! Caesar!
- Let go.
- Caesar, let go.
- Periyavar is dead.
- What are you saying?
He got drunk, fell down, and died.
I knew it since morning. I was
waiting for the function to get over.
I told you! They will never change!
They ruined an auspicious day!
- To hell with that rogue!
- Dear...
Nobody would cry if Periyavar
didn't attend this function!
- How dare you talk about him like that?
- Let go!
- Whatever it is, let's talk it out.
- Hey!
Caesar, calm down.
- Leave me!
- Caesar, listen to me!
- Caesar, wait.
- Let's go.
I can't stay here anymore.
Dad, let's go back to Kanakal!
Dear, there are already many issues there.
- Ray sir! Ray sir!
- Murugan is coming here.
Ray sir!
- A huge fight broke out at the function.
- What is it?
- Periyavar fell down and died.
- Oh, my! When?
He was going overboard at this age.
In the end, he faced the repercussions
of everything he had done.
He was either drinking or at some brothel.
It's the curses of those women.
I think he's lucky to have lived so long.
This is not the right time
to talk about it.
Caesar, what next?
Come, let's get on with formalities.
No. Something's fishy!
- Let's send his body for autopsy.
- No need.
Just pay your respects and
perform his last rites. Caesar...
Send his body for autopsy!
MORTUARY
{\an8}When will you give the body?
It's not easy to control these beasts.
It's okay.
- Ask all our men to come here at once.
- Okay.
We wanted an intermission point
for our movie, right?
Keep the camera rolling.
The intermission scene will happen today!
Attention everybody,
Mr. Periyasamy, aka Periyavar,
didn't die due to a fall.
He was murdered.
He was hit on the head, strangled,
and choked to death.
Time of death... in between
11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.
You will get his body
once the autopsy is done.
Please don't create any issues
until you collect the body.
That's all.
Periyavar was murdered?
Traitors!
Hey!
Who had the guts to do such a thing
during my family function?
- Kaalaya, shut the gate!
- Shut the gate!
Caesar, everyone here is a friend.
What's all this?
No!
Some friend here has played Judas.
Some of them here were against autopsy.
Caesar, are you indirectly accusing us?
Indirectly?
I'm directly telling you that it's you!
- Hey!
- Hey!
You both had a grudge
against Periyavar of late.
I noticed this during last night's party.
Yeah, to hell with it!
How were you so sure that Periyavar
was murdered?
He was killed in your locality
and near your house.
Why can't it be you?
Hey!
Caesar!
Bhai! Caesar!
Listen, Caesar!
To hell with you all!
Rowdies! They just won't listen.
Bruncle, why are they fighting
among themselves?
It's all good as far as
he doesn't doubt us.
Let them fight each other and die!
You shut up!
Leave me! I'll kill him today!
Move!
Okay, kill us and get done with it!
But we didn't do it.
He is our friend too!
- Yes, there was a spat between him and us.
- Let him go.
- But do you think we'd kill him for that?
- Will that happen?
Forgive me, brothers.
I acted out of haste.
Just leave it.
Who else could it be?
Some mole has made his way into our group.
Did any outsiders attend the function?
That wretch!
Brother!
You get on with his funeral.
I'll go, kill that wretch and bury her!
My child!
Oh, God! My child!
Don't hurt my child.
I'll tell you the truth.
Yes, he was staying in that room.
His leg was hurt.
I got him medicines and...
saw him off in the 1:30 a.m. train.
He called someone from this phone.
- Whom did he call?
- I've noted down the number.
- Why did the train halt?
- No idea.
Greetings, this is Tamil Nadu
Police Headquarters.
Tell me.
This is Tamil Nadu Police Headquarters.
Can you hear me?
This is Tamil Nadu Police Headquarters.
Damn cops!
How about watching
a Clint Eastwood movie?
CLITIS TALKIES
If Madhan rats us out,
then let me take the bullet.
You leave. I'll handle it.
I'll leave and then what?
Where will I go?
They will catch me by the time
I reach that corner.
In life or death, let's be together.
- Start camera.
- Rolling.
Action!
Guess what I learned from
my hero Clint Eastwood.
Bravery is not shooting down your enemy
without giving them a chance.
Give the enemy a chance as well...
- You fool!
- Yes, boss?
Can't you see them recording?
I've cleaned
all the negative shots so far.
Shall I play it on the projector?
You fool! Shut up and stand aside!
Ray sir, can we go once more
from the top?
Cut! Cut! One more.
One more.
- Start camera.
- Rolling.
Action!
Guess what I learned from
my hero Clint Eastwood.
Bravery is not shooting down your enemy
without giving them a chance.
Give the enemy a chance as well.
Confront and win the fight
by killing him!
Pick it up.
- Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar!
Last night, I saw him and Murugan
having a secret discussion.
- He's lying.
- He said something before leaving.
He said, "Finish the work.
Meet you in the force, Muruga."
They shook hands before Madhan left.
I'm sure they have some connection.
- Don't trust him. I'm innocent.
- Don't lie.
- I'm sure they are in cahoots.
- No!
He told me last night that Madhan
asked him for directions to the hospital.
Muruga, escape!
So, sir...
did you shoot it?
Yes, I did.
Kaalaya...
did his seizure attack remind you
of something?
No.
Remember the first political murder
we committed for Minister Karmegam?
In Madras. In that college.
We murdered the District Secretary's son
and his three friends.
Oh, yeah! Remember an innocent fellow
came in between,
got a seizure attack and the charges
fell on him instead of us.
Yeah!
Sir!
We need a scene for
the intermission card.
Let's go to the funeral ground.
Our clothes are wet.
We'll change and then go.
We'll finish it and change it
once and for all.
- Let's go.
- Good.
Come on.
I didn't faint even after
seeing so much bloodshed.
I murdered Murugan.
I don't think Murugan
is a police spy, Caesar.
No, Caesar...
moments before he died...
he said something about this director.
Once we leave this place,
let's go to Madras at once.
You leave.
What if he's a cop?
I will...
Brophew...
along with the burning pyre,
we'll also capture
his reflection on water.
Then tilt up from here...
- and capture Caesar's expression. Okay?
- Okay.
My father's wish, my dream
of becoming a cop, and my love Lourdh...
I lost it all because of him!
I have decided to kill him.
- And I will kill him!
- But how?
With this.
Using this weapon called cinema.
I'll make him desperate...
make him dance to my tunes.
I'll push him to face off
with the Lord of Death,
and as he suffers to his death...
I will shoot each and every shot
by myself!
This is our movie's interval block!
Pay your respects.
Ray sir...
let's start shooting?
Action!
Periyavar was murdered by...
a police mole!
There are a lot of moles in our group.
I killed two of them.
And soon the remaining moles
will also be killed.
It doesn't matter
where the leader of these moles is.
It doesn't matter in which high position
he is or how safely he is guarded.
I will track him down, chop him
to bits and pieces,
and hunt him down!
This is Allius Caesar's word!
Kadhar bhai, that was the mole
spying on you.
Bhai...
Maari, there's yours!
Hear me out, mate!
This is the intermission block!
Cut it!
Ray sir, the intermission card is done.
I have to hunt the leader of the moles
and you have to shoot it.
Instead of preparing for that,
why are you playing the mouth organ?
Hey, look!
- He looks awesome!
- Alliya... look at that!
- Look, that's Alliya. My son!
- Bruncle! Bruncle!
Stop it!
Sir...
why did you ask him to stop?
Let's watch some more.
We all are delighted to watch it.
- It's nice, right?
- That was my son!
So, keep enjoying it yourself. Okay?
- I don't get it.
- Durai!
Up until now,
everything I've filmed with you
will not even secure a bronze trophy
that's sold in our local market,
let alone an Oscar!
Hence, I'm dropping this movie here!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Do you think only you can shout? Dimwits!
Quiet!
Sit down!
I have made up my mind
to drop this movie.
If that was my decision,
then why am I here?
I could have set this on fire in my room
and left!
So, why did I come here?
Why? Tell me! Why?
Why?
Don't you all keep
screaming your lungs out?
Stop that, use your brain and think
why I came here!
I'll tell you why!
Ask me why!
- Why?
- Because in your biopic,
all you do is munch the betel nut,
blabber words,
thrash and kill people.
Apart from that, there's nothing in it.
I'll give you an idea. If you agree
to it, then we can continue shooting.
Or else, I'll be on my way home.
Mr. Caesar, I have to finish
and send the movie to Oscars.
I'm running out of time...
and so are you, to become the first
dark-skinned Tamil hero.
Keep that in mind.
A new movie titled Aboorva Ragangal
has released.
A new bloke named Rajinikanth
has acted in it.
He is dark, handsome and
also seems to act really well.
The popular opinion is that
he will soon become a superstar!
- Rajinikanth?
- Yes.
Fine, tell me.
Your biopic is a tad pathetic.
Hereafter if you live life
according to my terms,
and create a biography
that suits my movie,
we can continue making this movie.
Biography that suits your movie?
Yeah!
- I don't get it.
- Well, now...
Godfather is a don's biopic.
I hope you know it.
Why did it win the Oscar?
Godfather? Is it a touching story
about father and son?
To hell with your touching story!
Can't you see I'm talking to him?
You dimwit!
If a rowdy's biopic must be
worthy of an Oscar,
he must have done that rowdyism
for the welfare of the people.
His rowdyism must have wiped the tears
of the poor,
it must have put an end to the starvation,
and people must have worshiped him
like God!
What's your point?
Do you want Caesar to donate new clothes
to our village people?
I'm sorry, Caesar. This won't work out.
I'm leaving. Durai, come on.
Sir...
Sit. Please sit.
How can you leave just like that?
Explain it to us in a way we'd understand.
- What does Clint Eastwood do in his film?
- Have gun fights.
Dimwit!
This is what I meant when I earlier
called them all dimwits.
Like an unknown stranger
and all by himself,
Clint Eastwood arrives at a village.
He then thrashes the merciless villain
in that village
and finishes him off!
He changes all their lives for good
and leaves the village
as their hero. Right?
That's how your biopic must be!
Oh, Ray sir...
which set of people
can I go and save now?
I'm actually the merciless villain
in Clint's movie.
For every villain, there will
always exist a superior villain.
And there is one!
- Shettani!
- Hey!
- No, Caesar!
- Don't listen to him!
Caesar, if you are indeed brave,
then set out all alone
back to your native.
Nab Shettani
and hand him over to the police
so that the police will leave from there.
Do it and you'll be people's hero!
Don't take any of these fellows.
Only I'll go with you.
Let's make the shooting live and raw!
You will be the world's
first dark Clint Eastwood!
The biopic of people's hero Allius Caesar
will be...
my Oscar-winning movie!
What do you say?
Fine. It's over.
Give up.
Hey!
Vazhuvaa.
Quick!
Wicked Vazhuvaa.
He will lurk around and come back.
Go and start the rituals.
Stop crying like kids!
I'll return in four days
as the next Clint Eastwood.
Bruncle, will you handle it
all by yourself?
I'm not going all by myself.
I'm taking the weapon
called "cinema" along with me.
They will achieve their goal
but not the way they wanted.
Do you still believe that your tribe
and the police can hunt me down?
You could have at least fled...
and saved your life.
Even if we die, we
won't leave this forest!
Even if we all perish,
a tribal and a cop will come together
to hunt you down!
KOMBAI KANAI
Malaiarasi, your husband is here
to take you home.
- Stop the chores and come.
- Hurry up!
- Come on.
- Why did he come here?
- Why did you come here?
- Get lost!
This place has not evolved at all.
You raised your hand against a pregnant
woman in front of so many guests!
Ask her for forgiveness
in front of all Kanakal villagers.
Only then we'll
send her with you.
Do you think I came all the way
to ask your daughter for forgiveness?
Hey!
If not to reconcile with me, then
why are you here looking like a buffoon?
I guess the son has also gone mad
like his father.
Go back to your houses.
If anybody moves an inch...
How dare you ask everyone to disperse!
How dare you call me
and my dad mad?
Now, gather everyone at one place.
This village is where I was born.
Though we were chased away
from here for hunting elephants,
because of the love
I have for my soil,
- and for the affection I have...
- Komba!
on my matrimonial home...
Komba!
I cannot bear the sight
of my people suffering.
Hence, I will solve all their problems,
nab Shettani and hand him over
to the police,
- and I will fire up your lives.
- It's "brighten up your lives".
And I'll brighten up your lives!
I'm here with a visionary goal
for my people.
Uncle!
Thank you, sir!
You are our God!
Thank you, sir!
You are our God!
Dear God! In order to achieve
the visionary goal for your people,
as the first step,
please go the police camp where
our natives are being tortured
and free them
in the name of nabbing Shettani.
It'd be great if you do that.
Alliya, our God!
I shall do it for the sake of my people.
Demons! They chiseled our men's teeth
to look like Shettani's tribe...
and are framed as Shettani's men.
Make sure you do a neat job.
The headlines this time will read
"Shettani's Men Captured Alive".
Sir, someone named Caesar
is here with the villagers.
Oh!
Caesar...
do not munch betel nut,
do not use foul language,
and talk fluently in pure Tamil,
like Sivaji Ganesan.
You! Move!
Caesar...
step forward.
To your left.
Atthini will come and kill everybody.
I know it very well!
Atthini will definitely come.
You devil!
She will come and kill everybody.
Wait and watch.
Atthini will come.
She will come for sure!
Caesar.
Allius Caesar.
Greetings, inspector sir.
I'm Allius Caesar.
I have heard about you.
Weren't you acting in movies
a while ago?
Did that drive you mad?
What are you blabbing?
For people like you, who are in power,
the cries of the down trojan...
For people like you, who are in power,
the cries of the downtrodden for help...
will obviously sound
like blabbing, DSP sir.
Hey!
What do you want?
Hey! Spit out the betel nut!
You have arrested
people from my village.
And in the name of investigation,
you've tortured them.
This is nothing short of a police atrocity
in broad daylight!
This must stop right now,
and release our people at once.
I shall catch Shettani alive
and bring him to you.
In fo... four days.
Fine.
Who is that gentleman?
I'm telling you something so important,
and you want to know
who that gentleman is?
Amongst this illiterate tribal people,
he alone stood out,
looking like a literate.
Is his highness educated?
Well...
he's the so-called director who will
direct this so-called hero's biopic.
Director!
I don't understand anything
about what's going on.
Could you please write it on paper
and hand it to me?
Because none of them
can read and write.
Sir, I couldn't finish him off
by any other means.
If I provoke him against Shettani
and let them fight...
then Shettani will definitely
kill him, sir.
So, I brought him here
in the name of making a fake biopic.
Give me four days' time, sir.
He will be definitely dead by then.
Now I clearly understand
the noble cause you're fighting for.
Impressive!
Sign this with your thumb impression...
and free your people.
But if you don't catch and hand over
Shettani within four days,
I will arrest the whole village
and torture them.
That won't be necessary, kid.
Paingili!
Paingili!
Our God!
You have rescued our people.
You kept your promise.
Fine. Okay. Now go.
O Goddess, all our people are back home!
We never believed that they would
come back alive from that police camp.
Thank you, dear.
Now you'll come crawling back to me
with your sweet words! Sit.
Isn't there a single man in your village
who could fight for justice?
Looks like it's filled with weak oldies.
Why would our youngsters be here?
To be killed by the police and Shettani?
Only the few of us, who live here
embracing death, are here.
I heard that the Madurai fellow is there.
Just finish him off...
and we can bring down Karmegam.
Keep in mind, you must finish him off
in Kanakal itself.
Yeah.
We sent out all the youngsters
out of Kanakal.
We don't want our young men
to get tortured here.
And our women...
Fine. Calm down. Everything will be fine.
Here, have this.
So, director sir...
don't get all riled up for just this.
In a while, the villagers will
get riled up and start lamenting.
Keep the camera rolling.
You will get lot of scenes.
Don't you want that Oscar?
Long ago there was a king,
who ruled our people.
We lived in this forest,
and the elephants here have been living
among us in harmony.
We took care of
and safeguarded each other.
One day, a king came here
in search of elephants for his army.
We said he could take them
only over our dead bodies.
I came here to visit my mom,
who was suffering from pox.
But the moment I got here,
the police dragged me to their camp
in the name of investigation and...
All the police vent out their perversion
by abusing us.
When we refused,
the king took away our elephants
without our knowledge.
"A forest without elephants and
land without forest is no good."
Shouting that aloud one of our girls sang
the "Kaatubarani" and set herself ablaze.
The ruler was shocked to see
one among us sacrifice themselves.
Hence, he released
all the elephants back to our forest.
He then announced that girl as his
clan deity and bowed down to her.
And she was named
Goddess Sethukaali Amman.
This is the curse on our people, brother.
We have only seen people use
kinds of weapons to kill our people.
But the weapon that you are holding...
is the first weapon that doesn't kill
and gives us hope.
There is some magic in it.
Otherwise, do you think my husband
would've come to the rescue of Kanakal?
What about our people who thought
they would die in that police camp?
Could I have dreamt
of feeding them like this?
Uncle, I have done so much
for your village,
then why are you all lamenting
instead of celebrating?
Look, he got emotional.
Sir, now watch me go berserk
as I play the drums...
No!
The drum beats will give the impression
that our village is flourishing.
Shettani's men will rob us.
Fearing that we haven't even
done Sethukaali puja for years.
Oh! So, they will come if
they hear the drum beats?
- Damn it, let me play...
- Hey!
What's your problem?
Listen to him.
Do you think I'm here to eat your food?
- I'm here to catch Shettani.
- Horse!
I will use his men to...
What is it, Dad?
Do you hear that?
I can hear horses approaching.
There... there it is!
There it is!
- Come on, quick.
- They are here!
There are coming, Alliya!
They are here!
Check in every direction!
Come on!
Hey! Go and check over there!
Come!
Please...
somehow finish him off today.
Uncle!
Coming!
Oldie, is Shettani one among them?
None of them.
Where can we find him?
Southward into the forest.
That's where he is.
There's a full moon tonight.
He will be out hunting.
Give up.
Caesar!
In the biopic that I'm making,
you must catch him alive.
What a time to be precise
on what the story demands!
You are a true director!
You will definitely win the Oscar.
Hey!
Come on! Let's go
before the poison kills you.
He's dead. Come on.
Help!
He's still alive!
- He's still alive...
- Atthini! So, you did it?!
He is alive! Malaiarasi!
He's alive.
Save him.
Here...
don't give up.
Get up.
Don't give up.
Get up.
Hey! He survived!
Thank God!
You are my God, brother.
O Goddess Sethukaali!
Thank you for saving my son.
We might die...
but she will still keep haunting us!
Quiet! There you go again with
"dying" and "haunting".
- Shut up, you madman!
- Hey!
Atthini...
Call him a madman again
and I'll break your jaw.
You'll break my jaw?
You were about to die a few hours ago!
Shouldn't have saved you!
Here.
Hey! You saved my life?
It was the director who saved my life.
Malaiarasi, elephants are
approaching your backyard!
Elephants have entered our village.
Quick, come fast!
That's her!
It's Atthini!
- Stop!
- I will finish it off...
It's here for you.
Not to exact revenge,
but to show its gratitude.
What? What gratitude?
Look into its eyes and you'll understand.
We killed her mother!
She's here for revenge! Come back!
Get back here!
Get back here!
- Don't go.
- Go.
Come back. Don't go!
Fine, calm down.
Go back to the forest.
Fine. Go back to the forest.
Let go of me!
Alliya... come back! That's Atthini.
- She will kill you.
- No, it won't. Listen to me.
- Go. Go near it.
- No...
No! She'll kill me!
- She'll kill me. No!
- Hey!
- Don't be scared. Just go.
- No! Don't kill me!
Don't kill me! Please, spare my life!
Spare my life...
Atthini!
My deity! Alliya... look!
Atthini forgave us.
She forgave me.
Atthini... my deity!
My God!
She forgave me.
Alliya, look at that!
Atthini forgave us!
- Do you see that?
- Yes, she forgave us.
She forgave us.
Oh, deity!
Oh, Sethukaali Amma!
It was a huge mistake.
Alliya...
We shouldn't have left our land.
We shouldn't have.
Look, this is our soil.
These are our people.
We shouldn't have left our people,
this forest and Kanakal.
This forest is our God.
Save our tribe, Alliya!
Save our tribe, Alliya.
Oh, Goddess Sethukaali!
- Forgive me for killing Atthini's mother.
- It's okay, Uncle.
Uncle, it's okay.
It's okay.
Atthini forgave me.
I've committed no sin.
All your sins are absolved.
- It's absolved.
- Atthini forgave me.
- Atthini forgave me.
- Yes, she did.
Save our tribe.
- We will save our tribe.
- Save our tribe, Alliya.
- Atthini forgave me.
- Yes, she did.
You were once the hero of this wild herd
You found peace within yourself
And you left us
Ray sir...
shall we make a change in my biography?
There's nothing new anybody can write.
Just hold the pen firmly...
and whatever is meant to be written
will be written.
How do we express our grief?
- Do you hear that?
- Elephant?
No, black panther!
Finish him off, Caesar!
Come. Bring it on.
Who is it?
Caesar...
why didn't you finish him off?
Things didn't go
according to our plan, sir.
{\an8}He kept his word and captured Shettani.
He will hand him over
only if the CM comes here.
Or else, the whole village will
go to Madras to meet the CM.
Sorry, sir.
I was helpless.
How do I trust you?
Listen, you pothead.
If I bring Shettani here,
how will you identify him?
Do you have his photo?
No, sir.
I only have his finger prints.
Uncle...
All the fingers from his left hand.
You may verify.
Holy...
- You beasts!
- Yes!
Indeed we are beasts!
That's why I urge you to call the CM!
Thousands of elephants, hundreds of cops,
and how many of our people
had to die in the attempt to catch him?!
Call CM and she will answer.
Call up the CM!
- Damn it!
- Damn it!
Aren't you ashamed?
Madam.
A common man nabbed a vigilante
whom we couldn't capture.
Greetings, madam.
Where is Shettani?
They said they wouldn't bring him here
until you arrive.
They have left one of their men here.
Hey!
Mr. Caveman!
Sound the trumpet, sir.
Madam is here.
Madam, that's him.
My boy... Caesar.
You are not just the hero
of this village but our state.
Shettani, whom we couldn't catch
all these years,
has been caught and handed over to us by
Caesar and the villagers of Kombai Kanai.
I wholeheartedly appreciate them.
- Thanks to everyone.
- Thank you.
I promise you that this police camp
will not be there tomorrow morning.
All of you will get your identity proof
within a month.
- Definitely. Okay?
- Okay.
- See you, all.
- See you.
Hit it!
There's one more score to be settled.
I'll settle it soon.
I'll be waiting.
Dear...
today I'll show you!
I'll show you how the drums
must be played,
and the grand manner in which
to conduct the Sethukaali puja!
Hit it!
We wear, we wear
We wear our grace as an attire
We sing, we sing
We sing as we play our fiddle
Come witness our God's grace and smile
Let's unite and celebrate her
This forest is our nest
Where the sunrays hardly pierces in
The home of Goddess Sethukaali
Every life here
Chants your name
Ladies and gentlemen!
It's time for our deity's procession
We wear, we wear
We wear our grace as an attire
Friends and relatives!
Come join the celebration
Oh, Goddess Kaali!
Her aura is our protection
She wears this forest as her attire
She got on the elephant
Knocked the king
Ladies and gentlemen!
She is our guardian
Caesar, I'm worried about the DSP's
next move. Let's head back home!
Killing him is the climax of our movie.
Let's dance.
Hey!
Let him go.
We wear, we wear
We wear our grace as an attire
Friends and relatives!
Come join the celebration
This forest is our nest
Where hundreds of lives dwell
This forest is our nest
Where hundreds of lives dwell
She got on the elephant
Knocked the king
Ladies and gentlemen!
She is our guardian
Listen up, toads, cuckoos, and storks!
Listen up, huge, shining rocks!
Finally the season of celebration
Is here in our forest
Where the trees shed their leaves
Blessing this wedding
A marriage blessed
By the presence of our Goddess
Why are you so tense, Caesar?
Listen, go and get some herbal thorns!
Only then she will show you the baby.
Make it fast. Get it.
Yes, dear. That's our custom.
Get the herbal thorn.
Come, let's go and get it.
Sir, you also join us.
Come on.
As my son-in-law collects the thorn
My daughter gives birth
- A God's child will soon be born...
- Stop scaring us. Stop singing.
Who is it now, sir?
Uncle, you take this and leave.
- She's about to give birth...
- It's okay. You go. Come, sir.
A police gun.
How did he end up here, sir?
There are a lot of forest hills.
There are a lot of elephants.
And I've a lot of work left to do.
Wicked Vazhuvan!
Stomped me and went away.
Vazhuvaa!
Come!
Let's face off.
I'll be waiting.
Sit down!
Karmegam sir, madam's calling you.
Greetings, madam.
Madam! Madam!
- Madam!
- Don't you dare utter a word!
- Madam!
- Caesar, my boy?!
Do you think we really couldn't
catch this mongrel?
It was I who nurtured this mongrel!
I have given my word.
This forest hill and three more!
I promised to hand it over clean,
without any humans or animals,
to two businessmen in Delhi!
And that's why, in return,
I get to become the PM!
This has been my political ploy
for years now!
Your boy swoops in and tries to ruin it!
If you come begging for the CM post...
I will cuss you out! Get lost!
Look here, you better head
to your village.
If by any chance you tell all this
to your boy,
I will bury you and your family alive!
No, madam.
I will never ever see that fellow again.
The press is gathered outside.
- Destroy all the evidence they have.
- Okay, madam.
No one outside this forest should know
what happened here.
You! By sunrise, there should not be
a single living elephant in this forest!
And not even a single Kanakal villager
must be alive.
Okay, madam.
And the most important thing is...
I want that Shettani dead.
Madam?
Caesar, aka Shettani.
I want him dead!
Understood?
They can change anything and everything.
They can turn a tiger into a cat
and an elephant into a fox.
To hell with the forest
and those identity-less villagers!
Now, go.
The real demons are just coming.
Go save your people and this forest
from those political rulers!
Save them if you can! Go!
Caesar...
Come, Caesar. Let's go.
Vazhuvaa...
Come!
Battalion, salute!
The man handed over to us
by the villagers is not Shettani.
We got this news
from the intelligence report.
Caesar, who caught him...
is the real Shettani, who we've been
searching for all this time.
Those Kanakal people safeguarded
and sheltered him all this while.
So, we don't care even if they die!
Today, we must catch Caesar,
aka Shettani, dead or alive!
- And that's my order!
- Yes, sir!
They are on their way.
Please listen to me.
They will go to any extent
to capture this forest.
If we all run in different directions,
at least few can survive, Caesar.
Kanakal is our home!
Why should we run?
We'll tear down anybody who enters!
You can tear them down
only if they are in front of you.
They will just hunt you down with guns
from a distance.
If you kill 30 of them,
they'll send in another 100.
If that doesn't suffice,
they will send in more.
The one who's sending them
is the real demon!
Those who are coming...
are just workhorses.
Poor workhorses follow the orders,
in their uniform,
without even questioning it.
What will you gain by killing them?
The demon who gave orders
is somewhere far away!
The one who sends thousands ahead
and hides behind them.
Neither you nor these weapons
can do a thing to him!
Try to understand.
There are no winners in a war.
Here, have it.
My contribution to your weapons stack.
Use it and shoot few of them with that.
He has a point.
There is nothing to be gained
from killing innocent policemen.
But that doesn't mean we'll listen to him
and vacate this forest.
Nor will we run and hide.
Even if we die...
we'll die only in this forest.
You four take the kid and leave.
Let's all leave.
There is no history of anyone
returning after leaving this soil.
They will take over this forest and land.
That will happen even if you die.
Tell us if there is any other way.
Is there a way that our heirs can
peacefully live here after us?
Tell us if there is a way!
Is there a way for that to happen?
You! Everyone's voicing
out their opinions here.
Act like a true leader, step up,
and say something!
Leader?
I'm a nothing!
Now I realize that...
I am nothing!
Ray sir...
the most important scene of our movie
is yet to be shot.
Get the camera.
Let's shoot it.
Rolling.
Caesar, your acting must touch
the hearts of the viewers.
Be clear and sharp.
In pure Tamil...
just like Sivaji Ganesan.
Action!
This government has fooled us all.
They turned us into pawns
in their political games.
Shettani, the police,
you, I, and even my newborn
are nothing but their pawns that will
dance to their tunes and ultimately die.
An army is on its way here
to finish us and capture this forest.
They won't withdraw
until every one of us is dead.
Good take!
Yet we won't run away
from our land in fear.
Let's try fighting back.
We cannot defeat them...
but still let's try fighting back.
Let's finish off those few bad
and rest of the innocent police.
Now that both you and I...
have turned into humans with compassion,
we don't have the heart to take a life.
Hence, let's not choose violence.
They have guns.
Even more dangerous is the fact
that they have their political ploys.
Our guns, machetes, and spears
cannot match them both.
We will be destroyed without even a trace.
But in order to defeat them...
in order to dig up our buried history
and fight for justice,
and to punish these demons
who stab us from behind,
we have a weapon.
And that is cinema!
Even if they try to fabricate things,
the only weapon that shows an elephant
as elephant and a tiger as tiger
is cinema!
Even if we die today,
and no matter how long it takes,
cinema will serve us justice at any cost.
It will save the lives of
many tribes and forests like ours.
Putting all our trust on cinema
and its viewers,
we shall not fight
with those cops today...
nor shall we run and hide.
We shall happily dance and welcome death
face to face!
Shall we welcome it?
Yes, let's welcome it!
Yes, we'll welcome it!
- Yes!
- Let's welcome it!
Play "Kaatubarani",
the song of our forest!
Let's all become Sethukaali!
Oh, dear forest!
Come alive for us
My dear land!
My dear land!
Come with me.
Sir, they are not even revolting.
Then how can we...
There! They just attacked us.
Take positions!
Shoot everyone but leave Caesar for me.
Fire!
Oh, ruler!
Is this fair?
Reload!
With our blood in your hands
You shall win
Remember this forest and its air
Will absorb our remains
It'll come back and confront you!
So, be careful!
Take positions!
So, you can destroy us
But remember, when every tree falls
Its seeds grow into a whole new forest
Destroy one of us
And thousands of us will rise
Fire!
The poison has reached down the throat
The event has been carved
Our God has arrived
We see the light above us
Walk away even if your wings are clipped
When the first rain will pour down
It will wash away these blood stains
Let the forest get cleansed by our souls
And let history be written with our blood
If we sow the seed together
It'll will bring us justice one day
So here we are, sowing the seed now
Hey! Go away!
Oh, ruler!
Is this fair?
Paingili!
Holy...
That's my best shot ever.
The inspiration from our Chief Minister
and the push from my brother Jeyakodi
are the main reasons behind
this achievement of mine.
Jai Hind!
KOMBAI KANAI FOREST FIRE
{\an8}By court orders,
{\an8}Clitis Talkies and Kariya talkies;
the assets of Caesar, aka Shettani,
is being sealed in the presence
of the District Governor.
Sir, this is unfair!
So much is happening.
Now that he is no more,
let's carry on with our lives.
After the round table conference held
by our party,
I hereby announce Jeyakodi
as the next Chief Minister.
Brother, congratulations.
Congratulations to the next CM!
{\an8}MADURAI

{\an8}FUTURE CM JEYAKODI STARRING IN
A POOR MAN'S FRIEND
Greetings to all.
Please, sit.
MADRAS
Live long Jeyakodi!
Live long Jeyakodi!
Greetings!
It's me, your very own Chandran.
Right here, right now,
you are going to watch
the people's prince Jeyakodi starring in,
a film written and directed by myself.
{\an8}A POOR MAN'S FRIEND
Greetings!
It's me, your very own Chandran.
Right here, right now,
you are going to watch
Jeyakodi starring in a film written
and directed by myself.
No, you are not going to watch
A Poor Man's Friend.
You are going to watch
a story about rulers who killed
and will kill thousands of elephants
- and destroy many tribes and forests...
- Play my hero's movie!
Sit quietly and watch the movie,
or you won't leave this place alive!
- Watch this movie for your own good.
- Sit quietly and watch the movie!
Let us watch this movie and
raise questions for our well being.
You are about to watch
a movie starring Allius Caesar.
Directed by Ray Das.
KAATUBARANI
I cannot bear the sight
of my people suffering.
Nab Shettani and hand him over
to the police,
and I'll brighten up your lives!
I'm here with a visionary goal
for my people.
For my boy...
Caesar.
You are the hero of this state.
This is the most wanted Shettani.
The real demons are just coming!
Fire!
Hey! Go away!
Go and show the power of the weapon
that you are holding!
Go!
When you all watch this movie
in theaters, none of us will be alive.
Similarly many forests,
and the animals in it,
and many tribes like us,
for the sake of a few selfish jerks,
have been buried all at once.
The power to dig out the truth...
is only in your hands.
Confront those few demons in power
who betray our trust and suck our blood.
And for our sake,
just ask them this one question...
"Oh, rulers! Why?"
Oh, rulers! Why?
Why, oh, rulers?
This is tyranny!
Do you think you can do anything
if no one questions you?
This is unfair!
How can you destroy our land and people?
Sir, there's an issue.
What is it?
The CM wants to meet you immediately.
EZHAI THOZHAN
Everything is totally over, madam.
Karmegam is behind it.
They have carefully planned it all out.
Karmegam and
Jigarthanda Sambhavam Club gang...
MIDLAAND
in every theater in the South
expect Madras,
played that movie instead of
A Poor Man's Friend.
In order to prevent any phone calls to us
during the movie,
they destroyed all
the phone exchange towers in the South.
Moreover, they sent copies
to the oppositions party members as well.
Had he been as fair as me,
he could have become a hero.
It's so sad that he's dark-skinned.
Madam, a special show was arranged
for the Prime Minister.
Since morning, we've received
a barrage of calls from Delhi.
The whole town has turned hostile.
A three-hour movie has put an end
to your 30-year political career.
Madam, Karmegam betrayed us.
- He replaced all my movie reels...
- To hell with your movie reels!
To hell with you and your secret operation
to kill those rowdies!
CLITIS TALKIES
- Isn't he that SI?
- Yes, that's him!
Why is he here now?
Why is he going inside?
Get out of here!
Hey! Get out of here!
Karmegam, I'm really tempted
to shoot you at sight.
But that lady has asked me
to bring you alive.
So, if you cooperate and come quietly,
you can walk out of the theater alive.
Shut the doors!
Mr. Ex-DSP Rathna!
Welcome to Caesar's palace!
So, Mr. Pothead,
there's one climax scene
that Caesar wanted to shoot.
Without shooting that,
he refused to come out in public.
- He?
- Yes.
Who is "he"?
Brother...
Okay, sir.
Climax of Allius Caesar's biopic.
Shot one.
Take one.
Rolling!
Holy...
Holy moly...
You played a hell of a game!
Beats!
Can you guess the positive lesson
I picked up from my hero, Caesar?
Bravery is not shooting down your enemy
without giving them a chance.
Give the enemy a chance as well.
Confront and win the fight
by killing him!
The first one to shoot the opponent
can walk out alive.
Ready?
- Come on!
- Hey!
You're a worm that got shot by me
and survived.
I am the Lord of Death
who eradicated an entire race.
Hey, mate!
I'm an artist now.
No Lord of Death
can come close to us, the artists!
We are immortal.
So, shut up...
and come!
Go and show the power of the weapon
that you are holding!
Go!
"Oh, rulers! Why?"

Where's Dad?
Look at your mom and dad
on the large screen.
We haven't named him yet.
Malaiarasi once told me...
that she made a vow
to Sethukaali Amman.
If it's a girl, she'd name her Kaaliamma.
And if it's a boy, then Sethu.
Sethu.
You came into the world
with a brush with death.
Live like a king, my boy!
Sethu.
Rangabath Anna!
That's her, and she's holding
Caesar's child.
Their whole dynasty must die.
They must die.
Both of them must die!
