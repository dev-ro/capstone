Returning home late in the night.
Writing about those parties

But l am happy.

while l left Bangalore.
But papa supported me.
She is not a kid now, don't

Yes. l had a drink by mistake.
But l am fine now.
Doesn't matter. Come on. Sit down.
Okay. So you have come from Delhi.
To become a film star.
Yes, therefore secretary Tiwari..
..had taken me to
meet some producer.
l don't know where
he disappeared to.
And even l got lost.
Where do you stay?
Malad (E), with my uncle.
But l am searching for
a new place now.
lt is late in the nights
many a times.
The society people have
a problem with that.
What do you do?
l am a journalist.
Nation Today? - lt's been
six months now.
lt's nice.
You should feel it..
Hello..
- Hi!
Madam.. whose party was it today?
Some NRl. Hiren Sanghvi
or something.
One more non reliable lndian.
l have never heard his name before.
Therefore, the party.
- Oh, l see.
He wants to become a page 3 regular?
Jokers!
Hey.. will you have some wine?
l got some nice French wine.
No.. l already had two
glasses in the party.
And l don't want to become
a habitual drinker.
And l have to go to the
office tomorrow too.
You know, something, Mads.
Ever since you have shifted here..
..one thing is very clear.
- What?
We air hostesses have a better
life than journalists.
How is that?
You work from seven in the morning..
..till two thirty in the
night. The things..
..that you are interested
in, you must..
..not be getting time for all that.
Look at these lives, rocking lives..
You see them on the TV, isn't
it? l see this everyday.
Live.. Anyway.. good night.
Good night, boring.
Did you see Madhavi?
- She hasn't joined six months ago.
And she is arguing with the editor.
Forget it, buddy.
Who is this painter?
Who knows this man?
And you spent five hundred
words for him.
Because he has spent his
whole life painting. Sir,
l know these painters.
They will make a circle,
and put a dot in it.
They will say that it
is a woman's face.
Sir, that's because
zero symbolises life.
His life!
lf it was me, l would have used
not more than 250 words.
l would have printed his photo too.
lf there was some minister or
film star in his exhibition.
See, Madhavi.
Write about the rich and
famous lifestyle..
..for our readers. Not about
some loser painter.
Whose achievements are zero.
Then, what are the achievements
of NRl Hiren Sanghvi?
You want to know about
his achievements?
Yes.
He has bought this page
with his own money.
But..
Hello. Yes, l am coming.
Madhavi Sharma.
Page 22, distinction in
Mass Communication.
So such a brilliant student,
are you happy doing page 3?
Absolutely, sir.
Because, through this..
l get a chance..
..to write about some
deserving people too.
But l have to fight
a lot with you too.
But from now, write
about those people..
..who have a lot of
zeros in their life.
But on their cheque books.
Okay, sir.
No, Chetu.
l swear.. Listen to me..
Don't go by any gossip papers.
l don't have an affair
with any actor. Okay?
You are the only one in my life.
Now concentrate on
your cricket, okay?
Take care. Bye.. love you.
Abhijeet.. how do you
handle your boyfriend?
l don't have any boy
friend till now.
But l am looking out for one.

And they all loved it.
Why don't you do a favour to me?

Yes. Nice show. Good work.
Keep it work.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Good work. All the best. - Bye.
So irritating.
You will get all kinds
of characters here.
Some people embrace as if..
..they are separated siblings.
So what if they don't even know..
..each others names?
- l know.
And some people meet
the celebrities..
..right at the time when their
photos are being clicked.
With them, their photos
are clicked too.
And yes, the most important.
Whether anyone likes them or not..
..every one is good friends
with the media.

you. Generally.
Yeah, right.
Anyway. lt was nice
meeting you, Tarun.

Bye, bye.

There are so many people who..
my security agency..
Oh, that's cool.

..some hot and spicy chicken
and fish steaks.
Okay? Give some nice service here.
- Yes, sir. - Keep it up.
When should l come?
Why don't you do something
for her in Delhi?
Snehal, when are you
coming to Delhi?
All this phones and
all are a setting.
Suppose that l am driving the car..
..and there is a call for the
employer in the back seat.
And he says.. Hello.. yeah..
yeah.. yeah..
Yeah.. ..yeah, l am coming in
the night. Love you, bye.
lt is confirmed that it
is the wife's call.
He is correct!
Now, suppose there is something
about transaction.
What does a transaction mean?
- Business matters. - Okay.
Means.. hawala.. lakhs and crores..
Understand.
- Yes.
Yes, if he talks more to him..
..l mean.. a long conversation..
..means.. Yeah.. baby.. yeah..
baby.. yeah.. baby..
..yeah.. l love you, baby.. yeah..
Understand.. There
is something amiss.
The overtime is confirmed today.
Wow! Perfect!
They think that we
don't know English.
These people are crazy,
So what if Bosco is
a sixth grade fail?
Bosco knows English, understood?
lt is nothing. My
boss is so foolish.
ls it? Why? - Nothing.
Before going inside a party..
..he takes fifty rounds around..
..the hotel and calls up and asks..
..who has arrived? Who has arrived?
Why does he do like this?
- Nothing.
He thinks that he will be as
pricey as he arrives late.
Forget that.
My previous employer, Mr. Kishen.
He was something different.
He used to keep five pairs
of clothes in the car.
He used to move around in the car.
He would attend all the parties.
He would change the
clothes in the car.
And he didn't give me
any over time too.
All this are the big matters
of the big people.
ln a nutshell.. The one
who is successful..
..he has a candle by his butt.
- He is correct.
What are you talking about, Pramod?
The Saxena fluctuates
every other day.
Thousands and crores of capital..
..is being eroded just
being stagnant.
l think we should have patience.
Patience..
See, it takes time to take the..
..advantage of each
and every policy.
But till then all small and middle..
..scale industries
will be wiped out.
Thanks to MPs like you, Mr. Tyagi.
See, l am just the member
of the parliament.
Personally.. l don't
make any policy.
We will leave in some time.
- Hi!
Oh, hi! Gayatri. How are you?
l am okay. How are you? - Okay.
- Who are you with?
My secretary brought me here.
Okay, did you get a place to stay?
No. l am looking for work
and a place to stay.
Do one thing.. why don't you..
..give me a call next
week or something?
Yes?
- Yes.
Okay.
- Okay? - Thanks.
Bye.
- Take care.
Friend, make me an EP in some film.
She is a page three journalist.
Hi..

To know the breed of everyone.

Okay, don't forget the 21 st okay?
My 'Karva Chauth' party?
You are coming there, isn't it? -
Of course. We will love to be there.
Thank you.
- Bye.. Bye.. - Bye..
Oh my god, what is she wearing?
Oh god! So middle class.
She has got money, but not style.
'Karva Chauth' party?
Can you believe that?
Whatever party l go to, they
are there in every party.
Goa is great. The beaches
are beautiful.
The food is great, the best
sea food you ever had.
Take great care of them, okay?
They are my special guests.
- Okay sir.
lt was so beautiful.
l have been there so many times..
- Really, you have been there?
Rhea.. What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Put that
away right now.
l think she is totally smashed.
Mom. Just take a chill pill.
Don't worry, aunty. l
will take care of her.
Control her, Anjali.
Right, anyway, back to
my Vaishnodevi trip..
..you know, before l went to Paris..
..it was lots of fun,
lots of friends..
..and l was just screaming..
Hail to the Goddess!
Who she? Do you know?
Even Anjali is a social
worker like Mrs. Bhavi?
What else will she do
if not social work?
The husband neglects her, and
the daughter doesn't listen.
Poor thing.
- Why didn't you remarry?
See..
l have married twice and divorced.
l have money and independence.
My son has grown up, why
do l need a husband?
Excuse me. Hello? Yes..
where are you?
How are you? - l noticed you
in yesterday's party too.
Yes, even l noticed you.
Oh! This is so beautiful.
Hi..
- Hi..
Can l drop you somewhere?
Are you sure, l have friends..
The car is small, but
all you can come in.
Shall we go?
Come on in.
- Okay, thank you.
Good morning.
- Morning.
Thank god, it's Sunday.
A journalist has no
Sunday in their life.
Pearl.. what's your problem?
l have lots of problems. Look at me.
l am 27 years old.
Slim, sexy and intelligent,
but single. Look at me.
l have had three and
a half affairs..
..and l have been heartbroken
three times.
Three and a half affairs?
l didn't quite understand
this funda.
Three reached the bed room.
The fourth ended in the hall itself.
Pearl.. You won't change.
Mad.. Mad.. you are my last hope.
Hey, what can l do?
What do you mean, what can you do?
You go to such fancy
parties everyday.
You meet the rich and famous.
You cannot search one
millionaire for me?
Don't you get rich and famous
people in your flights?
l have kept that option open too.
But l am sick of these flights.
Sir.. can l get you
some tea or coffee?
Ma'am.. can l serve you?
Now. l just want.. some
servants of my own.
They should come to me and tell me..
..madam, how can l serve you?
What can l get you?
And l want one millionaire for that.
Will you help me?
l will try. You come to
the parties with me.
Hi..
- Hi, Madhavi, how are you?
l am fine, how are you? Good..
good. - Come inside.
Did you have any problems
in searching the building?
No.. the autos of Mumbai are smart.
He brought me to the right place.
Great. Come meet Pearl. Pearl,
this is Gayatri.
The one whom l told you about.
That girl in the train. She's
gonna share our place.
Hi..
- Hi.
Gayatri is from Delhi.
She has learnt acting
from some Mohit Sharma.
And Kathak from Pt. Sunder Maharaj.
- Why?
Obviously, Pearl. Because she
wants to become an actress.
Why do you need to learn
kathak to work in films?
Fill the form for Miss
lndia, miss world..
Straight ticket to bollywood, babe.
Pearl.. please..
Whatever.. l am going for a shower.
Don't mind. She talks a lot,
but she is good at heart.
Come in. l will show you your room.
Did you see that, Raghu? Nobody
is asking for more tea today.
Why?
- The owner of the paper has come.
Everyone has sniffed
a snake. Understood.
Sir has come.
- l understand.
Good day, everybody.
Please sit down and keep working.
Madhavi, any idea why he came?
What do l know?
Guys, l have news for you.
We did good.
- That's great.
The popularity of the page
three increased such..
..that they are increasing
the number of pages.
How many pages, sir?
- Easy.. easy..
We need more spicy stories and
more celebrity interviews.
There aren't that many celebrities
in the society, sir.
Create them.
Create them, and then destroy them.
lf you make the whole
paper a page 3..
..then what about our social
responsibilities? - True.
l don't make management decisions.
l just work here.
Okay, another piece of good news.
- What's that?
For these extra pages,
nobody gets paid extra.
That's not fair.
- l know..
And come what may..
l need three to four celebrity
interviews everyday.
Madhavi, are you listening?
Rohit, not like this.
lf you hold the gun like this,
it will seem real, not fake.
l had done an encounter in Panvel..
..with this shot and
from this distance.
lf you try the shot like this,
it will be okayed.
Okay.
What is your ACP doing
in the shooting?
What can l tell you?
He goes to the parties
in the night..
..and trains the heroes
during the day.
Why don't you write in
your papers about him?
Joe.. take the shot here.
Ready, Chintu?

First you tell me..
Were you able to make any..
..difference between
the real cop and me?
Yes.
You don't have to face
the real bullets.
Highlight the product.

For the common people.
And the slogan is.. The pride
of the common people.

Rohit, you have to do
something to help her.
Of course, Madhavi. Of course.
l have worked with Mr.
Charu actually.
Gayatri..
- Sorry.
Tell me. Why do you
want to start your career..
..from Mr. Charu's serious cinema?
Because l don't want to dance
around trees in the name of acting.
So you want to do
performance oriented rules?
Good. We have something in common.
Mr. Jhulka!
Sir.. There is a new girl,
her name is Gayatri.
She has been recommended by
Rit Kumar. l have auditioned her.
She gives perfect expression.
And sir, she has a
great dialogue delivery.
Sir, she is perfect
for Santhalika in our next film..

What should l do, sir?
Will she give?
Call her.
Sir, the article

There are just some corrections in it.
Yes, l will email it tonight, sir.
Bye..
Gayatri, how was your
meeting with Charu Mohanty?
Where is she going?
No, Rohit. How did he do this?
Gayatri had gone with
your reference to meet him.
l know. Do you know what a
state she is in right now?
And this Charu Mohanty talks a lot..
..in his films about
female liberation and all that.
This is not done, please.
You have to do something.
Okay, fine. Okay.
Okay, bye.
Forget it, Gayatri. Please.
Rohit Kumar has
apologized personally.
He said that he will definitely..
- Forget your drama.
Didn't l tell you that she
should fill the Miss lndia form?
Pearl, please.. what are you saying?
Pearl please.. what? One has
to compromise in Bollywood.
Pearl. There are good and
bad people in every field.
lf she gets one bad person,
is the whole industry rotten?
lt depends on an individual,
whether..
..they want to compromise and
move ahead, or with hard work.
lt isn't about good or bad.
lt's business. Give and take.
l cannot believe that
you are being so cynical.
l am not being cynical.
l am being practical.
Don't be foolish. - Me.. - Can't
you be sensitive to our friend?
l am being foolish?
- Of course.
lnstead of consoling her, you should
be telling her to be strong, damn it.
Yes. l know. l know.
But the next time..
..we will cover your wife's
candle exhibition very well.
Absolutely. Someone from
the office will call you.
Right sir, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yes, tell me, Nandu.
See, your crime reporter..
What is his name?
Vinayak Mane.
He is writing
anything about our MLA.
Call him back.
But he is in Nashik for a holiday.
That is the
election spot of our MLA.
Actually..
lf our workers get angry once..
then.. - Get up.
Who me?
Yes, get up.
We have printed just one
story of Vinayak Mane.
lf we print the whole story..
..your MLA will have to
leave the election area.
Did you have your tea?
- Yes.
Get lost.
Did you read
Vinayak Mane's MLA story?
Excellent. Has he gone to Nashik..
..on a holiday, or did he
go to search for a scoop?
Can he ever sit silently?
- Yes, that is correct too.
Hey, Kedar. Are you going
to Tejani's happening party?
The one in the town.
Yes. l am thinking
which hero to be. - Why?
The theme is very strange.
Bollywood night.
Bollywood.. Bollywood night..
They have different
styles and attitudes.
Even then.. the world
bows to their attitudes.
Very filmi.. very filmi..
Very filmi.. very filmi..

Madhuri has brought
life in the party.
Amitabh from Deewar..
You don't know his magic!
what do you think about
this Bollywood theme party?
What can l tell you
about his parties?
Just like how the law
and order of our city..
..never fails Tejani's
parties too, never fail.
But what l cannot understand is,
what is Paro doing with Chunnilal.
That's our secret.
You didn't come to my party.
lt was a great party.
But you came to Tejani's party?
- l was in Delhi.
But l gave good coverage.
So the Charlie's Angels are here.
Come on, Deepak. This is
supposed to be Bollywood party, okay?
Call us the three goddesses,
Deepak. - Three Goddesses.
You are not seen in
the parties nowadays.
Too much work.

The pages of your
newspapers have increased.
lf it is sold, it
will have to be printed.
Hi, Mrs. Bhavi..
- How are you, Madhavi?
You doing okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Enough material for your coverage.
lt's good that none asked for
the invite, or we'd be caught.
Come on. We will
drink and dance, come on.

Filmi! Filmi! Filmi!
He is saying filmi in the presence
of film people. Give me a match.
Do you smoke imported cigarettes?

Mr. Kothari? - He is gone now.
He had a solid passion for gambling.
What is gambling?

He had a passion for girls.
He took girls on a cruise.
A cruise means?

cruise to foreign countries.
A cruise, and then
another and then another.
He was ruined one day.

Santa Cruz.
He has a ready made
clothes shop in Santa Cruz.

l am so sorry, uncle. l am so sorry.
What sorry? Did you get

Sorry. - ls the matter

There were two problems.

This bloody idiot is dead.

Such nice and respectable live here.
Hey, Bakul. What is your problem?
Why are you irritating her?
Talk to me.

Looking at socialite's plastic
smiles in the party circuit..
..l thought where would

ln their unconditional love.
They don't see what is whose status.
Who is happening and who is not.

So.. sorry. So this

Yes. And my husband.
Ramesh has really supported me.
He funds this children's funds too.
Okay.

Good boy.
You know.. what is printed

You write it.
People will come to know about it.
Did you read about
Anjali Thapar in page 3?
Nothing much to talk about.
Hey, did you read the Anjali
Thapar piece in the Metro Today?
Yes. lt speaks less about
social less and party animals more.
Exactly.
You are coming to
Jack's party tonight?
Sir.. did you see?
Anjali Thapar's interview
was cut, the meaning was lost.
There was a ad in the last meeting.
l told Fauze to cut it.
But sir.. l have
worked so hard on it, sir.
What the hell is this?
You cut Anjali Thapar's social
work details from the article.
Could you not cut anything else?
You just reduced it
to a social butterfly.
Did she pay you?
This is the problem. All
you think about is money.
l don't know what has
happened to journalism.
Who told you that
you are a journalist?
This is what you write in
the page 3 column isn't it?
Who went in whose party,
with whom who went..
And with whom who came back..
Who wore, ate and drank what..
And what one didn't wear.
Miss Madhavi Sharma.
This is called entertainment.
Not journalism.
Some people never change.
Out of them is this.
Our Vinayak Mane.
What is the matter?
Why did you call me?
Sir, l have got a tip.

..loyalty to your partner.
Always have safe sex.
Especially for the youth of today
l would like to say that..
..don't hesitate to buy
condoms from the chemist.
Sir, your next film? - We'll talk
about that during the release.
Sir, one minute.
Madam, l'll ask the sir
to phone you later.

to talk to him.
l'll make him call you.
You don't worry.
Bye, Mr. Rohit.
Ok thanks.
Gayatri what are you doing here?
l've been trying to get you
on the mobile but in vain.
Then l came to know that you're
here, so l came here.
Gayatri, the press and
the media are here.
You shouldn't have come here.
Tell me what was the urgency.
- Rohit l'm pregnant.
Get it aborted. Ok. Bye.
Come on let's go.
Harsh, just a second. Hi!.
- So late?
Went to a movie and then
had dinner at Legacy.
O l see Just a second baby.
Has Gayatri come? - Yes, the
madam's mood seems to be bad.
Why? - The stars are moody,
you should know.
Yes baby. Don't meet that
ex wife of yours.
Don't double time me. l'll
beat you like a drum.
Now listen. Did you
take your medicines?
Please baby don't forget.
- Gayati. Gayatri.
Pearl.
Please drive fast.
You'll be fine. Ok.
Are you sure that this man
is from the Chandu gang?
Hundred percent Vinayak. He is
an old charge sheeted fellow.
Twice he has committed half murders
and has been to Dubai also.
Which means that he was
killed in the gang war.
Listen Vinayak. ln the gang war
sometimes our work becomes easier.
Yes, the governments
bullets are saved.
Here she is dying and you are
talking about rules doctor.
First you write a police complaint
and then we'll admit her.
Please you get her admitted first.
Look l'm a journalist.
The rest of the formalities
will be completed by us.
No.
- Dr. Sudharshan shall the treatment
. No, the formalities
have to be completed.
l will talk to Mr. Bhonsle.
- Vinayak.
Bhosle. - What happened? - This is
Madhavi. We work in the same office.
Doctor you start you treatment. l
will take care of police formalities.
You first get her admitted.
- Ok. Nurse. - Thank you doctor.
Thanks Vinayak. How are you here?
ln these places only you get
real stories. Not in parties.
Take care of your friend. lf
a need arises phone me. Bye.
l'm fine. l don't know she is. Yes,
the doctor has admitted her.
Excuse me madam.
The patient is out of danger.
But we couldn't save the child.
Sir, a lot of phones are coming
from Gayatri madam. What should l do?
Did you not make arrangements
for Gayatri madam?
l had taken twenty thousand
rupees and went to her.
l ask her to get the abortion done.
She got angry with me.
She refused to talk.
Sir, it's Madhavi calling
now. l'll cut it off.
O baby stop crying. - Madam
greetings. - Hi. - Hi. - Good morning.
Why are you crying?
l'm taking Mohit for a drive.
- Take the new car.
Ok.
- Take care, - Bye.
Drive carefully.
Why are you ringing up that
bastard. Will he come with a bouquet?
Madhavi you know that he
is a public figure man.
Pearl please, Don't talk
like this at this moment.
Then when do l talk?
The faster you come to your senses
the better it is for you.
Pearl why are you shouting?
l'm shouting because l care man.
l care for this stupid girl.
You'll be fine.
What Rohit did to Gayathri broke
her confidence completely.
She decided that she'll
leave the film line.
Pearl and me convinced her a lot.
But she went back to Delhi.
With informing the editor l published
an article in support of Gayatri.
There is a spicy article about your
boss published in the papers.
This is not about my boss. lt
must be about some other hero.
Do you know English. Will
you protect your boss?
Madhavi, you are also the limit.
First you wrote about your boyfriend
and l didn't tell you anything.
What evidence did you have that
Rohit Kumar did this to your friend?
But sir l know.. - Do you have the
proof? No you don't have the proof.
When you write something you have
to back it up with proof.
That goes for all of you.
lt is fortunate that
you did put his name.
Otherwise he could've sued us..
..and l hope you know that.
The company is proposing
to organise..
..its publication awards
for the first time.
The secretary of Rohit Kumar is
saying that he'll be part of the show.
Do you realise what
all has happened?
Thanks to your personal
scores that ..
..you're trying to settle
through this paper.
Sorry you don't have that right.
The decision of the
management is that..
..you've to apologise
to Rohit Kumar.
OK then. Thanks to you. l have to
take responsibility for this disaster.
l guess. lf that's what you want.
You?
Cut it. Very good shot sir.
- Please come.
Thank god. l have to get
ready for the next shot.
Call of them. l need them
for the night shot.
Sir, Madhavi madam and Mr.
Suri have come to meet you.
You get them seated, l'll come.
- Ok sir.
Joe, l'm just coming.
Come on. Don't move. Come here.
Hello Mr. Suri. How are you?
- l'm fine. - Hi. Please sit down.
Hey give me a sponge. Will
you have anything? - No.
Will you have anything. How is
everything Mr. Suri. - Fine.
l heard that you'll not perform
in our award function.
Who told you that? Of course l'm
coming. These must be rumors.
For me a commitment is always
a commitment, come what may.
However l've been hurt
by what happened.
Especially because it
was done by a friend.
You're absolutely right.
You're right. lt hurts.
You're right. Right Madhavi?
Rohit. l just wanted to say
sorry for this whole thing.
Hey Madhavi. Relax buddy. lt's Ok.
l know it happens. l've
no grudges at all.
We're friends, fine. How did
you ever think otherwise?
They're friends! Friends.
Mr. Suri, l tell you that your
show will be very successful.
Yes, l mean it.
l heard that you're going
to Guwahati for a shooting.
Yes, Mr. Suri. The shot demands
that l shoot there..
The interesting part is
that the character..
l understand. Star tensions.
Forget it Madhavi. These
things keep happening.
Professional hazards l should say.
Look there. - l'm sorry buddy.
- Look at that girl there.
You have started looking at girls?
- Yes, some of them.
lf this girl is so beautiful how
handsome her brother should be?
You are..
- l was just joking.
How is Gayathri? - l didn't
get any phone call from her.
How is Pearl? - She is getting
married and going to US.
Lucky girl.
- Yes.
There comes Tarun. What
happened to his car?
Couldn't pay the installments. The
bank people took away his car.
Vijay, you have a lot of contact
in the ad world, isn't it?
Why don't you use it to get Tarun
some big modelling assignment?
lf l use my contact
he will not like it.
Actually it has been discussed in
three to four places. - Really?
Something will be worked out.
You don't worry. - Thanks.
l'll reach the airport
in half an hour.
Madhavi take care of yourself.
Let's go Pearl.
Bye.
- Bye.
You're shifting to New
York after marriage.
l've been left alone.
Listen, if that baldy bothers you,
give him slap on my behalf.
Drink less wine, understood?
lf you are reminded of me
give me a phone call.
ls it? lnternational calls are
very expensive, understood?
That is why l asked you
to marry a millionaire.
Shut up. Ok.
You shut up.
Yes. When did this happen?
Ok l'll pass the information.
Sir, there is a breaking news.
Anjali Thappar committed suicide.
Show me that.
Hello. Hi.
What?
Madam Anjali is dead!
Hemant call the fashion designer.
So you need something
for the funeral..
..as well as the chautha
(fourth day after death).
l'll arrange for that. No problem.
When? Ok l'll be there.
Show me something in white.
lt must be because of depression.
Just a question of your life.
Honey where are you?
- l'm outside our bunglow.
Here everyone has come.
- Come on now stop it.
l'm in the midst of a three hundred
million deal. Don't disturb me.
The one who had to die has died.
lt's only a dead body there.
l know that. But you have to
do all these formalities.
Papa.
Do you think that Thappar
will marry again?
Why? What are your intentions?
Thappar is not a bad man.
But his daughter, my god!
What have you got to do with
the daughter? - Forget it.
Vijaya, l heard you're writing a
new book. What is the subject?
So you're also interested
in reading books?
Anyway, what is there in your
books other than sex?
What else interests you?
That's a point.
Buddy, madam Anjali was
such a nice woman.
She used to throw nice parties.
- Right.
How much liquor we must have had..
..on the house out of Mr.
Thapar's money?
Will there be no more parties?
Don't get worried. lt will start
after the thirteenth day.
ls it? Let's go and mourn.
- Let's go.
Did you get any assignment?
- l'm trying.
Ok, l'll take leave.
Any idea where they will cremate
her. Shivaji park or Chandanwadi?
Chandanwadi since most of her
relatives are coming there.
l think it will be a
sandalwood cremation.
Definitely not Sneha. This is a jet
age. lt will be the electric.
Moreover it is environment
friendly, takes less time also,
l guess you're right.
She was a gem of a lady.
l have met her in lot of parties.
ln fact l have given a lot of
donation for her charities.
Excuse me. What are you
doing? Let me talk.
Whatever happened is very bad.
God bless her soul.
Do you want me say something more.
- No, thank you sir.
Thank you.
Please. Please.
You must be seeing that the
crowd of celebrities..
..is increasing out side
the Thapar house.
This is Archala Thripathi for FTV.
Tell me when they
will take the body?
l can't live without
the air conditioners.
Sir, then how are you
doing your journeys..
..by foot and rallies in this heat?
Listen Joe. ln politics one has
to do all these dramatics.
Then it is all a drama
that you play act?
Like your films Joe.
You get a chance and you start
defaming the film industry.
Then Samar, how is your security
business going on?
lt is running fine buddy. The last
elections l provided security..
..to so many people. But not a
single payment has been received.
Anjali Thapar's death
is a loss to humanity.
The children in her orphanage.
She loved them a lot.
She had a great affection for them.
She looked after them well.
Under what circumstances
she died, about that..
Arti madam, what would you say?
lt's all very sad. She
was a sweet lady.
She had come my films trial once
and she liked my work a lot.
ln fact she use to encourage me to
do a lot of good work, you know.
l can't take it that she is no more.
lt's not nice buddy.
- This is life buddy.
After a few days everything
is forgotten.
Then there is only the
photo that is hanged.
Maximum what will happen. Mr. Thapar
will get a road named after her.
Anjali Thapar avenue. When people
like us dies one doesn't get..
..people who will carry the coffin.
Relax dear.
Anjali has left us forever.
lt's so shocking.
Let's not waste it. l've missed
our relationship a lot, Samir.
Don't know what l
am in search of.
Samir l was so good to you
and you were so good to me.
Samir please forgive me.
Joey are going to join the funeral?
l'll definitely be there.
l've seen a lot of Hindi
movies that worries me.
l'm yet to see a Hindu funeral. l'll
definitely go. - l'll go with you.
Mark my words. The who's who of
Mumbai are going to be there.
l heard that a lot of Bollywood
stars are going to be there.
Yes they will.
Are you leaving?
Yes, l have an ad film shooting
at the airport runaway.
We've got only two hours
permission. l'll have to go. - Fine.
They are disgusting. They
have started here also.
Buddy, why do they come to the
funeral with dark glasses on.
Half of them drink in the night.
Their eyes must be red.
To hide that they wear dark
glasses, understood.
Take the interview.
Madam Ritu, how are you feeling about
the sudden demise of Mrs. Thapar?
l still can't believe
that she is dead.
We were like sisters.
Unfortunately l was in Paris..
..for the promotion of my
new herbal cosmetic range.
lt is sad. l'm really
going to miss her.
Move away.
You think this is some fun
going on. Just stop it.
Can't you make out where to take
photographs and were not to?
John ask that journalist when this
interview will be telecast.
By the way did you to Hemant's
party? - Yes, we did.
Was Sakshi there?
- After the party.
Madam, today night at eight.
l swear.
Who are you sending a message?
Every one should come to know that
Ritu Bajaj is back in Mumbai.
Right. - And tonight she
will be in Ajtak TV.
l want to express my condolences
to the entire Thapar family.
Thank you.
Sir, one more question.
l want you to quote.
There are lot of Hindi films
on police these days.
What have you got to say about that?
Would you like this quote in Hindi
or English? ln Hindi please.
How was your shooting in Andaman
sir? - Fantastic.
We shot in scorching heat.
Are you coming with me?
lf both of us go together
it won't look nice.
You go now. l'll just join you.
See you later, bye.
Abhijit has told me about you.
The campaign that you've done.
Papa.
They meet for a couple of
moments and walk together.
They meet for a couple of
moments and walk together.
When the crossing comes
they escape away.
How strange relationships
exist here.
How strange relationships
exist here.
That's great. That's good.
So many people did
attend the funeral
Madhavi, five hundred words
by four o clock please.
l can't write it sir.
What?
What will l write?
That people were planning their
next party sitting there.
Messages were being sent.
They were discussing what diamond
set will match with white dress.
Shall l write all these?
Five hundred words. - l can't.
l'm so sick of it. l can't
Then what do you want to write?
There is something that..
- what?
Something more meaningful.
More meaningful. That's wonderful.
Social issues, like Rape, dowry..
..and all that kind of things,
right? - Yes.
Do you have any experience. Do you
understand what you're talking?
l don't want to do page 3.
One stubborn woman. Anyway,
come in. Come.
Vinayak. Madhavi wants
to do crime also.
ls it? Then?
For some day you teach
her the routine.
Sir, with me shell..
Vinayak she is serious.
She wants to do meaningful
journalism, right?
So it's decided that for fifteen
days you'll be with Vinayak.
ls that all right? Done.
Now Anjali Thapar, five hundred
words, four O clock, thank you.
Sir where are putting me with her?
ls she going to stick there?
She is a party person.
She'll return in four days.
Trust me. Trust me.
Challenge.
Hello. l'm reaching there.
We're reaching there.
Working with Vinayak l learnt that
crime based journalism is no party.
ln search of stories Vinayak
used to work day and night.
Tarun did not like my idea
of working in this field.
But he did support me.
We used to reach any nook or corner
of Mumbai in search of a story.
l'm fine. - Hi Madhavi,
what a pleasant surprise?
Madhavi is working with
me on crime reporting.
That is why she is not seen
in parties these days.
Madhavi there are a few celebrities
who in spite of not having..
..photographers nearby come
to such places and work.
Pratima madam is one of them.
Come on Vinayak. Doesn't your
articles create awareness?
That is just like that.
Shall l do some work?
This is Munna. Our lnformer.
This person is working with me.
- Yes sir. - Recognise her.
Listen Gullu. Stop this trade
in children. Get reformed.
Otherwise you'll be jailed for a
long period. Understood? - Yes sir.
Take him to the court.
Yes Vinayak.
- Yes boss.
You must be knowing her,
Madhavai Sharma.
Yes, that day in the hospital..
- Yes sir.
These days she is working
with me in crime week.
ls it? What will you have?
Shaukat Ali. When did
they take him away.
Fifteen days before. They
have booked him in POTA.
They don't even allow
us to meet him.
They say that he is an extremist.
Did he have a criminal record.
Yes doctor.
Come on fast.
Sir, there are fifteen injured.
Yes sir, fifteen.
Dead bodies? Five have reached
this hospital till now.
Five, yes sir.
l'll keep you informed sir.
Photographs will be taken sir.
Yes sir, thank you.
Hello. - Hi. Listen to this.
Shalini is sick.
She can't cover the Diwan's
marriage in Marriet.
You will have to cover it.
Sir the coverage of the blast.
Vinayak is there. He is
covering it, isn't it.
But sir, a party today? But sir..
Madhavi this is also work. - Ok.
My friend.. why did
you face away like this?
My friend.. why did
you face away like this?
l will look at the mirror.
l will look at the mirror.
lt's amazing to
travel in the first class.
Hi, Madhavi.
- Hi.
How have you been?
- Fine, thanks.
Long time no see, isn't it?
As it is, even l wasn't here.
l was in Spain since three months.
For the showing of my collection.
Absolutely amazing.
l must send you some photographs.
- Sure.
Hi.. Hello..
- Hi..
You know what? Don't
you know about her?
She is no more with page 3.
What is she doing?
Crime beat.
- Crime beat?
How depressing.
l know.
Okay.
Will you take some time?
Just some time more. - Okay,
so l end up first. Take care.
Take a little bit of rose water.
You put it in and
you mix it correctly.
Keep mixing it for
a while and then..
Hi..
- l, Hi, Madhavi, how are you?
You are in the crime beat nowadays?
Yes.
Oh! l heard that there
was a blast in the city.
Oh..
This place is very unsafe.
l am very scared.
Okay, Madhavi.
Yes, so what was l saying? Take
some turmeric, and some rose water.
And after mixing it,
below the eyes..
Now, see the movement, okay?
What do you think? Do you think
there is some foreign hand in it?
l have taken the inside photos.
Well, we do suspect some
foreign hand behind it.
We aren't very sure
about it, although.
Anyway, our intelligence
will find out immediately.
Do you know, Mr. Vinay?
As soon as we got the call, my
force controlled it immediately.
That's how my force is.
Hi, Madhavi.
As it is, you don't have to
be scared of this bomb blast.
Because the situation
is in our control and..
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
Nothing, l was thinking,
there was a blast in the city,
There is a tension outside, the ACP
should be in his area and jurisdiction.
You are in a party here.
lt isn't even 24 hours to the blast.
Do you even know how
many people are injured?
And there are a lot of places in
your areas with communal tensions.
Just because of the bomb blasts.
There can be riots too.
Should you be here or there?
Hey, come on.
Madhavi, life moves on.
That's the spirit of our Mumbai.
lf you want to know
the spirit of Mumbai..
..you should have been
on the site of the blast.
You should have seen how
people help each other.
But how will you understand that?
You are in high spirits.
See, Madhavi. - Don't worry. The
people who died in the blast..
..whether their photos get printed
or not, your photos will be printed.
On Page 3.
Madhavi.. come on.
Waiter.. my drink.
Cool it.
That is great. lt is three
days for the bomb blast.
The culprit isn't caught, but the
suspect escaped from the police jeep.
The jeep?
Hey.. hello. Are you
over your bomb blast trauma?
Yes, sir.
Vinayak.
- Yes? - Well done.
Thank you, sir.
And Madhavi, well done.
- Thank you, sir, thank you.
What about the MLA case?
l am going to Nashik in that matter.
What shall we do about this?
Shall we keep her on
crime beat or back to page 3?
No sir. l want to
continue with this.
No, sir, you send her to page 3.
At least she won't
fight with the ACP there.
You know that?
lt is my profession to keep tabs.
Madhavi.. Fauziya and
Shalini are taking over.
They will make your boy
friend disappear from page 3.
l will bring him to the page one.
He will remain on page 3.
He is getting a very
big modeling assignment.
He didn't tell me.
How did you find it out?
l am the editor.
Yes, he is the editor.
Maybe, he wanted to surprise me.
- Candle light dinner.
No four.. two.
Good day, Madhavi.
Yes, Shalini. Yes.
l was stuck in the traffic.
Yes, l have reached right now.
Okay, l will talk to you a
little later. Okay? Bye.
Auto..
Khusrow..
Listen to me, Madhavi. Please. l am
sorry. You were hurt because of me.
But.. l am not the only guilty one.
Tarun wanted assignments from me.
lt is done now, Madhavi.
There was nothing
intentional about it.
Let's forget about it,
such things happen.
lt happens in society. Listen to me.
l don't want to lose a
friend like you, Madhavi.
Please, forget it.
Please..
Madhavi..
Tarun never called me, nor did l.
Maybe he didn't need me anymore.
l involved myself in work, l didn't
have time to think about anything else.
Whenever l got time..
..l used to spend time
in Anjali's children home.
Give it to me..
Rhea.. Hi..
- Hi.
Wow.. good work..
Thanks Madhavi.
Hello, madam. l am Munna here.
Yes, Munna.

Bhosale, shall we go?
- We cannot raid everywhere.
This is Mumbai's gutter.
lt is better if it stays closed.
What do you mean?
l mean, l don't have a warrant.
There are people above me too.
Vinayak had told me something
else about the way you work.
Bhosale.. Magistrate Joshi

Come on, it is about
the lives of small kids.
We will have to save them.
Bhosale..
These people..
Come on, open the door.
Hey wait.. what is going on?
- Come on, didn't l tell you?
What is the matter?
Where are you going?
Why are you hitting me? - Check

Pimp for fair flesh, you pimp!
You are very excited, isn't it?
You are in heat?
Thapar.. you have less money

Come on!
- Don't worry.
Sir, l am Madhavi.
Yes, tell me.

Drugs were being consumed there.
Don't argue with me, okay?

Give it to Mr. Thapar now.
- Sir.
Yes?

Everything is done, okay?

Thank you for your help,
Mr. Bhosale.
Let's go, Marvin.
Gaikwad, release everyone.

Mr. Kadam, our
relations go way back.
Don't worry. l will
take care of the rest.
Okay, bye bye.
Driver, go out.
- Yes, sir.
This is all of it?
They are all the evidence.
We shouldn't leave this story.
He is a sick man. This
should be published.
Are you crazy?
We get the most
advertising revenue..
..from the Thapar Group of companies
and their foreign collaborators.
That means, money.
And don't you know
about their lobby?
Yes, Mr. Kadam.
Yes, tell me.
Tell Mr. Thapar not to worry,
every thing will be in control.
Fine, Mr. Mirchandani.
Bye, bye.
What is the name of that girl?
Sir, she is a good journalist.
We will lose a good journalist.
Fire the bitch.
Remove her.
You may leave now.
Good night, sir.
Come in.
Why didn't the article get printed?
We had stopped the press.
Was it very late?
Sir..
Would you like to sit down, Madhavi?
No.
This was not done, sir.
This is not done.
l thought that you would help me.
l.. l believed in you, sir.
lt was the question of
small children's lives.
And you know that.
Why?
Why did you do that?
lt was a good story, Madhavi.
Good story.
Yes, sir.
l understand sir, but..
Sorry, ma'am. We have
already hired somebody.
Mail your resume.
We will get back to you.
Okay. Thank you.
No. l will look for some other job.
lt is easy to run from the truth.
lt is difficult to face it.
l was trying to tell
the truth, isn't it?
But nobody wants to listen.
- lt isn't like that.
The people want to
listen to the truth.
How do we tell that?
Thapar's story was laid down.
lt was your fault.
- Why?
lt was wrong for you to
dare to cover the story.
And secondly, you gave all the
proof. Didn't keep anything with you.
Why did you believe
in people, Madhavi?
The system will want
to stop you, isn't it?
Do you know why Anjali
Thapar committed suicide?
Because she found
out that her husband..
..was picking up kids from
her orphanage and with them..
Madhavi.. it is
necessary to tell the truth.
lt is important to
find out how to tell that.
Sense is as
necessary as being honest is.
We have to be in the system..
..to change the system.
Remember this.
See, Madhavi, there is a
job in my publication.
But not the beat that you want.
l can just give you
the page three beat.
And l think, you are
best suited for that.
Tell me. Will you do it?
Yeah. Just need to keep
it on for a few more days.
You cover it there,
l will come, okay?
We will meet page
3's regular celebrity..
..and the host of this party,
Mr. Hiren Sanghvi.
Mr. Sanghvi, how do you feel on your
company's first year anniversary bash?
Oh, it's great. lndia is great!
l mean.. my business
turnover is hundred crores.
Bombay is really rocking.
Shall l tell it in English?
No, thank you, l got it.
- Or in hindi?
Hey, welcome back. - lt's been
so long. We really missed you.
Really?
Aren't you drinking?
l have given up drinking.
Well, cheers for you then.
You are everywhere. l

Good luck.
