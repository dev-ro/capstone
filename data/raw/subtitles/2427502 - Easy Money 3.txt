You should be able to find the leveler blindfolded.
Got that?
Pablito, you acquire vehicles.
You provide also false signs and takes care of smâchipparna.
And then there's David. Zit forced me to him.
The less he knows about the job, the better.

Day jobs. All this should have regular jobs.
No boozing. Not a drop of alcohol.
And no drugs. On no account.

Okay? Then I'll be happy.
Makes me happy, Nata.
Born ...
There will be a change.
Give me two months, then you'll see.
Two months.
When the alarm goes off, we have three minutes.
If the guards do their job, no problem.
But the task force could become a problem, so we are heavily armed.
We blow up the gates and go out.
The first door is here. We get the code of our guy on the inside.
Here stands a guard. Probably armed, so he must be disarmed.
Malo, you take care of the guards here.
Where is the money. Check out how much it is.
If everything goes the way it is about 100 million.
Maybe more.
Aside from what ñnnen should have become the 12.5 million per head.
More money than anyone here has seen.
Now we Nynäshamns Tiling, a company that went bankrupt last year.
I got to know the owner and was renting the premises and vehicles of him.
Armed robbery can give 4-10 years in prison.

Take it easy, Camilla. Keep track of what you're doing. Okay?
We got tired quickly. Ville on.

We're moving home.
We move back to Serbia!
- It's about time. - I've had enough of Sweden.
You can not. You do know that there will be war if you go home.
It's a sensitive situation.
It may look as if you are fleeing.
- That's it. - We appear to be weak.
I do not understand you now.
I want to build up again.
Again?
They attacked two of our clubs. Now is the time to take it all back.
We can not back down now. It's the wrong decision.
Ten or fifteen years. Should we just throw it all away?

You should be happy. Believe me, I do not sleep.
On the day everything goes fast. They do their business.
But when everything died down and it's back ...
The war ...

Vad ... they made.
No matter how much one tries to change his life ...
So ... is always something happening ...

Something that forces one back to the hell they came from.
You sleep like a stock, Martin.
I think we need some slivovitza.
I have two bottles of moonshine.

What the hell have you done, Martin?
Look at me.
Here.
You should go in and dance with my daughter.

Do you want to destroy my hotel?!
Spotting is still going on after the 33-year-old who is believed to have survived-

The public is warned. He may be armed and extremely dangerous.

Take it.
Sell ​​it. It's worth a lot of money.
Will you forgive me?
Choose the right path in life, okay?
Off you go.
- Hello? - Hey, can I talk to Nadja?
- Salinas? - Who is this?
The money the girl.
- This is Martin, my friend. - Ivan.
I've talked to the folks back home ...
I'm pretty sure that the one who killed your father is an assassin.
Semyon Averin, aka John Johansson.
"Volk", aka "Vargen".
In addition to the Interpol calls him, he has committed a dozen murders.
I have found out.
Who he works for?
Russian mafia, oligarchs and eastern European crime syndicate.
Radovan was stabbed in the back by his closest man.
You need to make peace with that damn rat Stefanovic.
Otherwise, he takes the life of you, too.
Hey. Open the bag.
You can go down.
How does it work?
Good. My forehand sucks, but Dino plays like a rake, so it's quiet.
We go directly to the stores. Thanks for letting me come so quickly.
I'm just a young girl and you're a man.
You have experience.
You are in your prime. I have to drag me out.
Maybe it's best that you take over daddy's business.
We must be honest with each other. War is not good for any of us.
I have never wanted war with you.
Nata, you would be fine with me.
Come here. You are so beautiful.
Pubs me.
If you intend to kill me, so do it now.
If you intend to kill me, so do it now.
Hey DA, Nata.
Zoran has cleaned up the bodies.
I have to report me.
It was self-defense, we had no choice. He killed my dad.
I have an apartment in Oxford. And money.
And then what?
Then ... we put ourselves under a blanket, just you and me.
Nothing here at home means anything to me anymore.
It's only you I need.
- Martini Come here! - What the hell are you doing here?
- Call the police. - They'll kill her! Say what you want.
- I can not help you! - You should only drive a car!
Jorge, dammit ...!
- I have no other. - Is there no ...?
- No, I can rely on. - The money then?
I do not care about money! They cut her finger, you know?!
She is pregnant.
They kill her in the night if you do not help me.
- What is it? - Nothing.
But you know what it means to just draw.
- Are you scared? - No.
All right. Wait here.
- Where are you? - Organize the little things. Coming soon.
- What is it? - Nothing.
I will soon.
- Promise? - I promise.
Thanks, bro. I have the car over here.
As the hon occupants chorus you!
All right. The money - Nadja.
Calm, calm. Drop the bag.
Okay, you cunt! The money is here now. Send me Nadja!
Nadja!
Back off! Back off!
Go to the car. Go.
Go into the car, baby.
Wait until she's sitting in the car.
We have to turn around! Turn!
Turn! They'll kill him!
But, dammit!

What the hell ... You stupid cunt!
- What are you doing? I told you ... - Come on! Come on!
I said, drives to cop station! Did not I say that?
You must leave here.
- Run away. - No.

Get out of here now.
And!
Vad fan ...?
Turn the car!

Good God, chase beg you ...
Protect my family.
Protect Nadja.
This time I recognized him. Dad's old enemy.
I trusted you.
We let you in here.
Zoran is on the way.
I asked him to extinguish you.
Get out of here!
Your fucking cop disgust!
Unpack everything. This is our house.
Do not worry, Mom.
I Fixes money back.
Whoever stole my dad's money will regret it.
Thanks for the help with the Swedish tax authorities, Mr. Andersson.
Mr. Kranjic was clear-
-That the Foundation would invest in homes for battered women in Montenegro.
The transactions would be kept secret even for the immediate family.
I assume that his assets are in good hands.
Obviously. Tragic what happened.
Health family that the money invested in meaningful activities.
Radovan Kranjic has been attacked before. Many times.
- Hire a junkie with automatic weapons. - No, he should be afraid.
He should know that he should die.
Steal explosives here in Belgrade. And building a bomb.
I'll rob his entire fortune and start a war within the family.
He'll pay.
Tjena, brorsan! Hey, bro! Jag kunde inte svara förut, jag satt på en tenta. I could not answer before, I sat on an exam.,sv
Jag är på väg mot flygbussarna nu. I'm heading for the airport bus now. Det vore fint att ses. It would be nice to see you.,sv
I really missed you.

I really missed you. Hey.

Here you are. The final payment.
You know, he told me that when he was a kid-
-He told his friends that his father was king.
With the castle and everything.
The friends were jealous. They wanted their dads would be kings.
Then he learned that his father was not a king but a thief and a liar.
He did not live in a castle, but in a prison.
He was so ashamed that he wanted to become king himself when he grew up.
In order to get everything he wanted and to gain respect and money.
A lot of money.
When he got his life's most precious gift, when he was with you-
-Filled his heart by so much love that he could not run anymore.
He realized that he was not a king-
And that he had never been there.
A true king is not feared, but loved.
He brings not only, but also gives a lot back.
I ... just wish I could say to him ...
... That a dead king can not raise a child.
But you can say it to him.
Here.
The best part of being dead is that no one looking for one.
I'm sorry, but he asked me to wait for two weeks.
And health that he would understand if you will not.
In that case, he asks for pardon, a thousand times over-
-For having been such a wretch.
- He's down at the fishing boat. Thank you.
