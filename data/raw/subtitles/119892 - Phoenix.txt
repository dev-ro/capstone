I've seen it a hundred times at least.
-Really?
-yeah.
I haven't seen it since i was a kid, it was on last night
Let me ask you a question
Natives on this island. They build this huge fucking wall, designed to keep out king kong
wouldn't you?
the scene where king kong attacks the village to get that screaming woman.
he attacks the village and he forces his way through these 2 giant doors.
That's the scene they use for the poster
 Kong breaking through the giant doors.
They built a wall, to keep out this giant gorilla .
why the fuck did they put two giant doors in it big enough for kong to fit through ?
what the fuck were they thinking about?
Plus, King Kong can climb the Empire State Building
but he can't climb this wall
did they coat it with KY jelly or something, it doesnt make sense.
doesn't make sense
Take him downtown!
Are you all right?
Come here.
what's your name, i'm a cop it's okay?
What's your name?
Veronica.
For how long are you, veronica?
I just came here to get some penicillin.

You know you're the first person that asked me this question today.
Hey, Sid!

I am a diabetic Harry...
And Ester, she got blood pressure.
You got no idea what my medication can do.
Sid, get to the point!
i neede money, Harry.

Louie.
Louie ?
Next time you need money, you come to see me.

Get him to see a doctor.
He owes almost 2000$,
what am i gonna do?
You're going in there ?
I'll be right back.
Harry, Harry, Harry,
Is it business or pleasure?
Sid canned his tab.
Ok? don't lend him money anymore.
Sure,it's recalcitrant anyway.
Deal.
who broke his hand?
Well suppose i tell you it's your buddy.
Mike Henshaw
what mike does on his off time,i don't care about.
I also know that mike would never hurt Sid.
Look i don't wanna start anything.
you pick a girl.
Any girl. it's on me.
Don't worry about it.
I'd hate you to run me in
And then i would have to elaborate with phoenix police about
 my relationship with detective Henshaw.
Who broke my landlords hand?
Jesus christ, this is what you're getting all wind up about?
Yes.
-who the fuck cares ?
-i care, Mike!
I didn't go after Louie just because of you.
Tell me, who broke sids hand?
Look i'll talk to Louie.
Mike, i wanna know this guy's name.
Tell me!
Harry i make really good money working for Louie.
Do you know what position you're putting me in?
Mike, i'm not gonna discuss the fact that you're a fucking cop.
We've known each other since 16 years, i am your fucking friend.
Don't fuck a friend.

And don't you fucking sass me ever!
You understand me?

Eat your fucking hotdog!
Alo!
Hei, Seymour, what's up?!
Yeah, yeah.
what are the stakes?
what? 100,000$?
Definitely, I'm gonna be there in 20 minutes.
20 minutes, yes.
Lock it up, lock it up.
I got to go!
You got to be kidding me?
No, I got to go.
I'll be back in a few hours.
Harry, don't tell me that there's something you'd rather do than make love to me right now.
Actually yes.

Poker.
You're gonna go play poker right now?
Yes.
What?
I'll be back in a few hours, 
I can drop you off wherever you want me to drop you off
wait a minute, maybe i can come with you,
maybe somebody there wanna have sex with me.
Enough of this, No!
No, you can't come.
You'd be a major distraction, these guys are there to play poker, they're not there to stare at
take off your bra.
I don't get it Harry,how could you have possibly lost all that money?
Not one of those horndogs had their eyes on one thing but my boobs the whole entire night .
you almost had 3000$ at one point harry...
shuh... 3000$
I thought that Murray,? 
Wasn't he the one with the cigar?
yeah, Murray.
I thought that Murray was gonna lose it all over the cards.
How could you lose Harry?
I don't know.
Poker is a funny game.
Funny.
How old are you Veronica?
21.
On my next birthday.
Let's bet.
I win, you have to do whatever i want
I figure it should be fun, Harry.
And if i win?
Gee, Harry, If you win
then i have to do whatever you want
-Fine.
-Fine.
there's a nine, an ace, a pair of nines,
Jack and ace, three nines,
Four nines.
Four of a kind.
do you know th odds of getting 4 of a kind are ? five studs? five hands ?
one in 4000.
do you know what beats four nines?
Royal flush.
Do you know the what the odds of getting a royal flush are ?
One in 700000.
And the odds in dealing both in 5 studs,is one in over 2 billion.
I obviously cheated.
I obviously don't mind.
My dad once dealt that hand
he wasn't cheating.
it was in Lubbock, Texas, a nickle and dime game.
They shot him nine times and killed him.
you're very cute, Veronica
but you're bad luck.
I'm gonna take you home.
don't touch me.
Veronica!
Harry, stay the fuck away from me, all right?
Damn it!
Double or nothing.
That was double or nothing.
Pay up!
Harry!
Chicago is outside.
how you doing Chicago?
Betsy's Revenge.
i know.
Say again, that you dumped 3000$
on the wrong one.
you got a flaw about you Harry,
you know that.
Chicago, the point was of me playing the sure thing.
You don't know how it's gonna turn out.
there's one kind of gamblers, losers.
You know sometimes i can't figure out,
if you sound more like Duffy Duck or Sylvester the cat
what do you owe me Harry?
you owe me 16000$,
you got one week to come with the money.
You're despicable.
seven days, Harry.
Seymoure, don't hang up,
Seymoure, don't hang up!
listen to me!
why the fuck didn't you tell me the fix was in?
All right, all right, fine!
listen to me, i want 16000$ down on Astafy, ok?
16000$... yes!
Astafy, it's a fucking character.
I don't give a fuck if they're messing with the calendar,
Just put that fucking bet down, you hear me?

Mike.

I'm sorry honey,
That's the way it is.
Mrs Shuster!

Solar panels for the pool.
Yeah honey, but we have a pool, and a roof.
I got to go.
The tile guy is coming over, he's gonna strip my...tiles.
Yeah, gotta leave.
goodbye Nutter!
Bye Harry.
Speaking about our conversation before.
Let me bring that cocksucker Chicago in.
Won't you forget about it?
What do you mean forget about it?
he's a fucking bookie, let the cops bring him in .
This has nothing to do with me being a cop, I gambled, i lost, i owe him.
I'm not gonna welch.
I didn't say welch.
just give me 5 fucking minutes with this guy
I swear to god i'm...
We got a corpse at Salt River,
let's move.
Now would be good.
I don't understand, why the fuck you don't break Chicagos legs?
I'm not gonna welch
Well give me a break with this bullshit code.
just put a bullet behind his ear.
No.
Officer.
do you know this guy ?
who gives a shit ?
Somebody whipped off a heroin dealer.
listen, i got a bet down that's gonna cover everything, ok?
All you gamblers are the same, what's next
Louie?
I could be a bit of a loan shark in my life.
You could do what you do and you will.
Freddie, this turned me on.
what about you ?
Hey guys, a little respect for the dead,
it could be someones father.
I fucked her.
bullshit.
i did, ask her.
give me one.
got a light?
what am i, a fucking corpse?
bad luck.
what bad luck?
Three on a match is bad luck.
give me the lighter!
Match, lighter, it's the rule of threes, bad luck.
You superstitious fuck.
give me a lighter.
I'm telling you, it's a proven scientific fact.
They did a study about this.
I think it was over at Cornell.
Two guys, one lit two,
one lit threes.
The guy who lit two, was fine.
the guy who lit threes, died of cancer
Second hand smoking.
Great, fucking great!
Listen why don't we shake down a couple of whorehouses ?
I'm not a pimp.
Pimps make money from whores.
I'm not a pimp, i'm gonna be fine,
just back off.
Listen to what i'm telling you.
I hear you.
Hi!
What do you want?
How is Veronica?
I like your name,
Leila is a very pretty name.
Don't check up on me.
I didn't sleep with your daughter.
So you thought she was bad luck.
what kind of bullshit excuse is that?
You think making love with my daughter is bad luck?
And aren't you sweet for not sleeping with her.
You are a pig, you know that?
Veronica has never had a man in her life, that didn't end up being an asshole.
And you had every chance to be better than that.
You are a cop, for christ sake.
She wound up in a strip joint, poker game,what's wrong with you?
Shit!
Are you all right?
Would you get out of here.
Ok.
Hi, Leila!
Could we talk?
are you hitting on me?
What is this, a penthouse letter mother and daughter combination bullshit ?
No.
I just wanted to tell you you're right.
And i am sorry.

Good morning Harry, let's go,
Chicago's finest breakfast.
Let's go!
Astafey.
Astafey.
Astafy.
Dostoievski.
"the honest thief".
I never met an honest thief.
But once i knew an honest man.
Who happened to be a thief.
Did you read the book?
No.
I had to look that up
Cause i couldn't believe how stupid of you to drop 16000$ on that fucking horse.
Harry,
You're down 32000$ now
what were you thinking,Only a stupid gambler would double his bet to get back to even.
but look,
I'm in a position to help you.
There's this guy
who is in the custody of your police departement
And this guy likes to talk
So maybe you shut this guy up
And maybe i forget the 32000$.
Chicago,
You're gonna get your money.
How?
You're tapped all over town.
geez, I am only asking you to pop off one lousy crook.
for 32000$.
i am sorry about the other night ok.
Really i am, harry.
I am under alot of pressure, Harry.
you know what i mean?
you got 48 hours to come with the scratch or kill that guy Joey Schneider.
The police will take care of everything.
and that's it?
That's all i got to do?
that's all you got to do.
and until then,
You are cut off.
not bets, nada.
You're not even laying down a fucking lottery ticket.
Until you kill this kid harry, i own you.
Seymour, it's Harry,
Seymoure, Seymoure...
don't hang up.
Harvey, Harvey, ...
please wait ...
Marvin, it's Harry, Marvin

Wait, they believe in some voodoo ritual.
Fuck.

Don't you see i am fucking busy here?
Who the fuck are you?
Just a cop.

yeah.
I heard you were caught running pickups for Chicago.
what, me?
Also heard you like to gamble.
No, you got it wrong pal.
you ever read Dostoievski?
No.
You should.
"Crime and punishement", "dream of ridiculous men",it's killer stuff.
Dostoievski was a degenerate gambler.
look i don't know anything about anybody named Chicago, all right?
Chicago?
forget that.
I just wanna play some cards.
Dostoievski once wrote a letter to his wife
In which he described his sensation of having an orgasm.
After he lost a conisderable amount of money at the roulette table.
wait, wait, this fucking Dostoi...
Dostiev...
Dostoievski.
he laid down a bet, he loses and he splat .
yeah, he splooched right there at the roulette table.
Are you a good writer?
The fuck is that school system you grew up in?
I don't read too good.
You bet on anything, anywhere, anytime.
Let's play high card.
What do you got?
Got a king.
Don't even know what the bet was.
The bet was, i win i kill you
You win, i let you live.
Chicago likes you dead. I owe him 32 thousand dollars, what would you do in my place?
what would you do?
Please.
You're lucky i played aces low.
You keep your mouth shut.
You serve me everytime you got to serve, you understand me ?
If i find out you kept your mouth shut,
you get along just fine
you rat out Chicago,
yu know what do they do to rats in prison, Joey?
How old are you?
20.
Never rat out anyone.
You understand me, never,
it doesnt pay in the long run.
And while you're in prison, Try to read a little,
not Dostoievski but some Mark Twain.

Thank you for coming forward.
It's very brave of you.
I'll have to set a meeting with your attorney's office.
Now you do realize it's gonna be difficult for you to testify.
You are aware of that.
I did what i did for my husband,
lieutenant.
It won't be difficult to testify against that pig Henshaw.
yeah.
-Louie.
-Mike.
Let them in, Norm.
nice job!
Collecting that 13000$ from Carl.
yeah, well i'm very fucking sorry.
Here's your money.
Sit down.
You ever watch National Geografic
or any similar shit?
Do i look like the kind of guy who watches National Geografic or similar shit ?
Fascinating stuff.
I watched a story
the other day about relationships.
about fish, Sharks, barnacles, crabs.
they achieve something.
which i strive for.
it's called parasitic castration.
The barnacle lives and grows inside certain crabs.
a mass of fibre, extends through the crab and actually alters
the body of the crab, into a female,
regardless of what sex it was.
The barnacles reproduce.
But not the crab.
Fascinating shit!
yeah!
Louie, check it out!
Thank you, Norm.
Want me to stick around?
I am good, Norm.
You sure?
Positive.
My basic intuition tells me you're the new girl
that's right.
let's see what you got.
Mama mia!
come over here.
let's see what you got.
Nature is full of relationships, Mike.
Full of them.
like leeches.
they crawl into the bluefish , for example.
And suck the blood out of them.
The leeches have to keep the bluefish alive.
otherwise, the leech dies.
The barnacles have to keep the crabs alive.
otherwise the barnacles die.
Am i getting throught to you?
Abso-fucking-lutely
You want to make an example
out of somebody who owes me money,
Make it someone who doesn't owe me alot of money.
I need to keep my little bluefish and crabs alive.
Mike!
I got something for you.
Fucking come back later, i'm kinda busy right now.
I must...
I'm a little busy right now, come back.
you're not paying Dominic, are you!
Please, this is really important.
just get in here.
Hi?
Harry... look, please don't tell Fred
it would kill him.
Get the fuck out of here!
please, Harry, i love  Fred.
get the fuck out, Katie!
Turn around and leave!
The fuck is the matter with you?
How the fuck could you do that to Fred?
What do you want Harry?
what do you want?
You said you had something figured out.
what is it, what do you want?
I want Louie.
You heard me.
I want Louie.
Listen, you know his setup, you know his timetable
How much money he's got and where he keeps it
Harry, why would i fucking heist Louie.
Jesus, you fuck your friend's wife, you make collections for this scumbag
but a heist for me is out of the question?
- this isn't easy for me, Harry.
- Fine. whatever.
you know Harry, you got to be an honest man to work for Louie.
I'll go hang myself .
You're gonna hang yourself !?
what about me?
you don't want me to wack Chicago because there's a bullshit code that 
don't let you welch on a bet but you're gonna rob a loanshark to pay it off.
If i don't pay back Chicago, 
he's gonna fucking own me.
I'm fucked.
it's a perfect crime, Mike.
We get masks, we're in, we're out, it's clean.
He can't call the fucking cops.
Right, and he's not gonna know what hit him.
yeah, it's perfect.
you want a beer?
No.
Mike, what's this shit with Katie,
What the fuck are you doing?
what do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me you're not gonna pop her anymore that's for one.
she's nuts.
She doesn't cum unless i smack her,
Whip her, call her a whore.
you think Fred likes it?
whips her, calls her a whore ?
i don't think so.
are you gonna help me or what?
Sorry i had to be the one to show you these.
In case you want to hear the audio.
No.
Pretty nasty stuff.
Henshaw is in all kinds of shit,
We all know that.
i got to have something solid.
Just give me something to put him away.
like clockword at 2:30 every morning they open up the safe and count the receipts.

They keep the money in there from loansharking operations and strip clubs.
I've seen it open with half a mill.
how many guys is gonna be around?
4, 5, 6 it doesn't matter,
they are not expecting us.
who the fuck is that?
calmd down, it's all right.
What are you doing here?
What's up ?
Nothing.
What's he doing here ?
- I invited him.
- You invited him...
- I invited him.
- you invited him !?
You wanna do it one more time, yes i invited him.
A, we are a team the four of us
B, we need someone to drive the car.
I can drive the car.
You're pissing your pants.
I don't have to take that shit from you, all right?
I need the money just like you do.
You're not cut out for this.
 Guys...
Harry, I am not gonna trust this dildo to drive us around.
What are you saying, Mike ?
I am saying that you don't have the stomach for this.
Take it easy.
What the fuck you're getting so excited about, Freddie ?
I can drive a lousy car, James.
No one said you couldn't but it's not that simple.
For christ sake,
You're giving me shit about it.
guys,we don't need this,
Come on.
At least i can be trusted.
What the hell does that mean?
what the fuck does that mean?
what the fuck does that mean ?
Stop, stop, stop.
We don't need this.
Harry, talk to this prick, will you.
Prick ?
you're calling me a prick ?
You fucking freak!
Fuck you!
Stop!
Jesus!
Slow down, relax.
listen to me Mike,
it's gonna take three of us to knock over Louie, right?
-Right.
- Ok!
We need someone to drive the car.
I would have felt more comfortable if Fred is driving the fucking car.
What's the big fucking deal?
- Will you pay him out of your money.
- Fine! whatever,Come on!
Fred, you're driving the car.
Sit down.
Robert Johnson, huh?
it's a very antique jukebox !?
How are you ?
What's the name of this song ?
Terraplane Blues.
My grandpa used to have this car.
Said he got it to 88 miles/h and that was in 1938.
The song isn't about a car.
Really?
You think there's a hidden meaning to the line: who's been 
Driving my Terraplane Blues since i've been gone?
Maybe i'm wrong, but the line :
 i'm gonna get down deep in this connection
keep on tanglin' with your wires
Seems to me it's about a guy singing about a shortage in his wiring system.
I flash my lights, mama,
but this horn won't even blow.
Aha,little generator won't get the spark.
Am i getting through to you ?
No.
You're still a pig.
i know.
I bought you a present.
I don't want it.
Something to remember me by.
It's a little pink pig watch.
If you press this button right here
Go on.
See, so you're all right.
I am a pig.
here you go.
you get your own pig watch.
Thanks a whole lot.
you're welcome.
Don't you want a drink or something.
No.
You know a place where we could get a good pie ?
No.
apple,it's really good.
I don't wanna get a pie with you.
i don't like it.
You like the watch don't you.
Oh i love it.
You sure you don't wanna get something to eat?
No, i ate, i have to get home.
Early. it's only...see
here you go.
 Fine.
Oh, man.
Wanna go to the movies or something?
i can't.
why ?
Why you busy ?
I just can't.
If the drop on the left here,
beats the drop on the right
you have to go to the movies with me.
they are off!
- come on, come on, left, left...
- Oh...
I won.
We bet.
Can't welch.
- i told you, it's perfect.
- let's hope they can find this shithole in the dark.
Maybe they're lost.
what's up with Fred ?
he's like a little edgy lately.
then stop fucking his wife.
Maybe that will help.
it's a good point.
here !
I got you a taco.
where did you get that shit.
the only place that was open,
do you want it ?
the fuck did i just say, no.
- Fine.
- My ass will burn if i ate that.
Fine.
what time does the bartender leave ?
2:30, i don't know,
2:30, approximately more or less.
What kind of guns do Louie's guys carry ?
9 mm, 12 gauge bore diameter.
there he is.
- i don't know
- Mike...
Are you sure about the money being there?
what the fuck is wrong with you tonight ?
nothing, nothing.
i know a man that used to work for a loanshark.
So ?
He used to tell me the worst thing a gambler can do 
is borrow money from the loanshark.
loan shops are okay, but not loansharks.
Harry, borrowing money from a loanshark 
and stealing money from a loanshark
are two different things.
It's still coming from a loanshark though, Mike.
It's better than cheating.
I'd never cheat, never.
Gamblers who cheat are more interested in money than gambling.
What's money ?
I don't gamble to make money.
No shit.
You think that's fucking funny ?
Hell yes, i think that's funny.
That's damn funny.
What's wrong with you anyway ?
Somebody a little testy today ?
Not in the mood for you funny shit that's all.
Oh, I see what it actually is.
It's a case of a little testy.
You want a fucking piece, motherfucker ?
- You can't take a hit ?
- Knock it off!
What the hell is going on right here, guys ?
Is the heat getting to you ?
I am talking on the goddamn phone.
Keep this shit out.
Detective Shuster.
Katie, no, we already told them once.
Listen to me, do what i say, just take care of it!
What are you looking at ?
Take it easy, Fred.
Has anybody seen my lighter ?
No.
God damn it!
Tell me about taking it easy.
Did you steal it ?
- did you take it ?
- No, i didn't steal your fucking lighter.
Son of a bitch.
it's the only thing my dad gave me.
it's my lucky piece.
Why would i steal your father's lighter.
Because you are a sadistic fuck, that's why!
Fine.
this is not good.
Not good.
I need some air.
Where ?
it's fucking Phoenix, there is no air.
John, you got some matches ?
Here you go.
Thanks.
Hi.
So you came to collect on the rain drop ?
That's the first bet i have won in a long time.
Wanna take me to the movies ?
Yes.
Tonight is not a good night but...
So why did you come to see me ?
I've lost something of mine, that brought me alot of good luck in the past.
And i just wanted to have something of yours for luck.
I wouldn't know what good luck looks like.
It's really important to me.
what do you want it for, Harry ?
It doesn't matter.
why ask me, why not somebody else ?
Because i like you.
And i just wanted to come from you.
You're a gambler.
You wanna change your luck.
Get yourself sucked out of whatever this shit you got yourself into.
Just don't gamble with me.
I won't.
can i have those matches ?
I'll come by tommorow for breakfast.
I'd like that
Harry!
thanks.
give me one will you.
get over your scientific facts.
I believe it was Cornell University?

You're the one who shot Louie, before he got to open the safe.
i had no choice.
Stop!
Can't you just take the whole safe ?
No, it's bolted down.

You can listen for the tumbler.
