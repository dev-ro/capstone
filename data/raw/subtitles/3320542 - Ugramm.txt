My Dad taught me this Shloka.
One night..
I learnt from him,
a Philosophy of that like a lightning.
In the Battle field..
For the one who has fear even a herd would be less..
For the One who has guts even a Pebble is not required.

<font size="14"><b>[Narasimha: Ugra Avatar of Vishnu]</b></font>
		'Ugramm'
<font size="16"><b>(meaning : Momentous Anger induced by a great period of Tolerance)</b></font>
For his Deadly Criminal activities..
The most known Cruel person in the Criminal World was..
'ShivaRudra Lingayya'
Alias
'Onte Rudra'
<font size="12"><b>[Onte meaning: Camel]</b></font>
He accepted a big Smuggling Deal.
<font size="30"><b>When he went near Prabakar, a Shipping Company Owner for assistence in this deal.</b></font>
Prabhakar Rejected it.
Getting angry with this,
ShivaRudra Lingayya slaughtered Prabhakars wife.
When he went to kill Prabhakars child,
Prabhakar accepted to help with No other Choice.
Behind Prabhakar's Acceptance,
even Revenge was hidden.
<font size="30"><b>From one of his Ship carrying the Load from Dubai</b></font>
In the middle of the route,
Prabhakar secretly unloaded 90% of it into another ship..
Sold it to a 3rd Party and left for Abroad.
This side Shiuradra Lingayya..
was eagerly waiting for his Load.
But when Shivarudra Lingayya saw the Amount of load in the ship,
He realised about the master plan of Prabhakar.
<font size="30"><b>Using his son he operated his Business activities from jail itself and became Successful.</b></font>
The beautiful world that Prabhakar was building for his daughter..
..might someday burn to ashes.
was the Prabhakar's all time Fear.
<font size="28"><b>Even after several years,
wounded Shivuradrayya's thrust for revenge did not fade away.</b></font>
20 years later...
Anna (Brother)..

<font size="24"><b>[Place] : Shira</b></font>
Sir, the information is right,
Prabhakar is here in Australia.
Where is he?
He stays in Sydney.
I will snatch everything, leave..
One more thing
His daughter is coming to India, Sir.
Prabhakar is sending his daughter to India?
I have hacked the WiFi of his house,
In the mailbox, a ticket has been confirmed for tommorow.
Sydney, Singapore, Bangalore.
Bangalore International Airport
She left..

going out of the city in another Innova car.
She is going to 'Mughor' <font size="24"><b>(Place)</b></font>..
..to see her Mother's grave.
Dont kill her easy..
The Scene..
must be very Cruel.
<font size="24"><b>[Place] : Sydney, Australia.</b></font>
Hello.
<font size="24"><b>[Place] : Talagvara</b></font>
ShivaRudra Lingayya's revenge has started.
Remember..
The nail polish your daughter has put is Pink, 
You will not recognise her face.
<font size="24"><b>[Place] : Bangalore</b></font>
Hello
Why did you let her come here ?
She somehow left..
I told you earlier only to tell her everything.
In this situation, only you can help me.
I dont have the power to face so many people alone.
You used to tell about a guy...
'Agastya'..
Don't have the time to think Vishwa..
In this situation nobody would come to help us.
Give me the number called by Nithya. -> <font size="20"><b>[Prabhakar's duagther]</b></font>
<font size="24"><b>[Place] : Kolar</b></font>
Agastya, you have to go 'Talagvara' now itself.
Oye, get moving..
Whats the urgency..
Nithya means you only right?
Found her.
No problem, she is fine.
Why do you worry, I will take her and come.
Oye! what do you want ?
Get me a Soda, Masala should be less.
- Oh..

I came from a bike,
Ok for you..?
You are still a small kid,
You wont understand all these..

We are the Men here,

What are you searching for..?
You told
" We are the Men here "..
He has got up from the left side I guess..
He is standing here, to get beaten up.
You think you can take her away right in front of me..
Take her n go.

Take her n go !!
<font size="24"><b>[Voice] : </b></font>Where did he go..??</b></font>

I will have to send the other guys to kill you.
<font size="32"><b>If ShivaRudra Lingayya wins in this Bi-Election of Shira,

They would be searching for her, everywhere..
She cant return without her passport.
Did you see the Bike Number ?
Couldn't see all the numbers,
but 100% its a '07' registration.
All are Bloody Useless.
<font size="14"><b>[literally said as 'DandaPinda']</b></font>
She cant approach the Australian Embassy, have arranged like that.
- Anna..
Your men have come Anna.
Ayyo..It will be done as you said Anna.
Daya,
Fax this profile to the Australian Embassy in Delhi.
Send an information that,
We have filed a FIR in a murder case against her.
Ok, Sir.
<font size="32"><b>Prabhakar Uncle's Shipping Company still has its Case pending,
so we fear he might get arrested here.</b></font>
Oye, stop the car.
Nithya shouldn't contact her father for any reason.
There are many favour's from Prabhakar Uncle upon me.
Till we send her back, let she be with you.
07 is Kolar's registration right ?
Yes
Suppose that the girl called him from this STD booth..
Is it possible to reach Talagvara from Bangalore in 1/2 an hour.
- No.
What are you thinking of ?
I am thinking of what story should I say to Amma?
From Kolar, one can reach Talagvara in 1/2 an hour, right ?
- can reach Anna..
Thanks, I will call you back.
Nanda, you get down here and go to Kolar..
You would meet one of our guys called Narasimha.
Get along with him and search her.
Why did I ever come here..
This is a very bad place.
In a days span you learnt everything huh ?
I should have listened to my father's words,
Have I done anything to anyone ?..
Without any reason,
why are everyone against me ?..
Everyone in this country are like this only huh !
I hate India.
I had thought this to be a very colorful place.. 
Seeing our flag, you would have thought like that.
Now, lets go to our home.
All will not be the same in this country.
<font size="24"><b>[Place] : Judges Colony, Bangalore</b></font>

She is not just a mere girl,
She is my Retaliation of 20 years.
I have been waiting for this from 20 years..
Election would commence one again in another 5 years.
Ok, father.
Let her be anywhere..
I will bring her in front of you.
There shouldn't be any trouble in this Election because of Appa's Stubborness.
For any reason.
Amma shouldn't get to know anything about what happened.
If she gets to know, then she wouldn't allow you inside the house.
Dont ask me why ?
You have come here looking for a job, so have brought you here.
Understood right ?
Nod your head like this for whatever is being asked.
One more thing..
In this house, there are two of my Chikkappa's (Uncle) sons who are like monkeys.
Be careful with them.

Only with her death my revenge would come to an end.
No..No..No !!
Can't get it from anywhere,
You gotta go to the market and bring the right vegetables..

But, he used to hate this country.
I lied to him and came here against his Will.
Then, you are ready with everything to go to Spain ?

Only left with the booking, wanted your Credit card.
I haven't seen my mother..
I came here atleast to see her grave in this place.

Today to sit in this Office, Rudra is the sole reason.
To return that favor..
I have gone against my party members and given him a ticket.

I think this would be your last chance.
Anna..

No..
Will not ask for anything else..
But, expect one.
Want to see Amma..
Once.
If it will bring you more trouble, then don't say..

It's small and green..
It's like a small Pumpkin.
You have only these many fruits ?
- There's more in the vehicle.
- Where's your vehicle ?
It's called 'NelliKayi' (Gooseberry / Amla)

Let him keep you in a Palace.
Apashakuna, you just spoke !
I neither want a Soft guy, nor a Software Engineer..
Even if he is rough and a coolie, its fine.
Enough if he has a soft heart.
Dont want him to take me in a flight..
Even if he takes me in a bike..
Its enough if he takes me to where I say.
Don't want a Palace, Maintenance is more..
Enough if he gives me an umberalla,
so that am not drenched in the rain.
Keeping an eye in my eye so that nothing happens to me,
Enough if he saves me all the time.
Who are you, Kid ?
How that sun is the biggest in solar system,
Like wise this 'Kitti' is the biggest in this Kolar system
Ok, why have you come here ?
He told there's a Foreign Halwa here..
- What ?
Veeresha told that..
There's a gal who is better than our English teacher..
..so came here to see her & go.
All my life, had heard that there's gold in Kolar..
Have seen it for the first time.
eeh small chilly, just go to home..
Go.
Oye! I will get guys from our area, just wait !
All of them will be of your size, right.

But..
Without the Candidate himself..
As soon as Dad recovers, will send him to Shira.
Till then the Canvasing work musn't stop.
Ok.
Found 'Venkat',
He is in Shivaji nagar's Veera Pillai street itseems..
Excuse me..
Amma told to give a cup of Sugar.
ree, take this.
Come here.
Finally we are moving to a different house..
These many days,
we were staying in this house with no other choice..
I had earlier only thought of telling you about him.
- about whom ?
About Agastya.
I dont't know why have you come here,
But..you be careful dear.
Did you bring..?
The neighbouring Lady....
You went asking for sugar to our neighbour "Sharada"..!
Coming out of their homes is itself a big thing
and you went near them..
Ok.
Give tea to Agastya and come.
<font size="18"><b>{Background]: tell him that the sugar's less</b></font>
Anna, the constables have come.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Veera Pillai street, Shivaji Nagar.</b></font>
4 days back he came here,
Since then he is like this..
I wanted to ask you few things about Agastya..
People are speaking about him..
You guys don't know about him..
They are saying something n al about Agastya..
He is a Monster !
They are even saying he has killed a few..
What are you saying..!
Was he a Gangster ?
Don't taunt him..
People are sayin that he is an Animal.
Be far away from him..
As they say, is he really a Dangerous person ?
That girl..
- That girl can't be snatched from him !!!
That girl can't be snatched from him at all !
False,
Whatever you've listned about him is all false.
Agastya is not a dangerous person..
But a very Dangerous person.
Not only a few of them..
He has killed many of them.
He was not a Ordinary Gangster.
But still he is not an Animal.
Will you listen to Agastya's story ?
500 miles far from here..
There's a place called 'Mughor'.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Mughor</b></font>
In that Empire of Monsters..
In those history's verses written with red ink..
Breaking the tolerance and raising up of Agastya is itself a big Chapter.
Once there was a problem in the industry called Underworld. 
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Delhi, Kolkatta, Mumbai</b></font>
All the gangsters wanted a safe place in India,
likewise its there in Dubai. 
aaiy...Silence!
Upon the idea given by a Veteran gangster called 'DasAnna',
All their eyes shifted on a deserted, secluded kind of place called 'Mughor'.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Mughor</b></font>
Using their Wit, they got involved in devolopment activities.
With the citizen's attentention,
They started a movement and gave a vision for Civilization.
As time passed, With the support of the people..
They started the revolution of turning Mughor into to a new state..
Protests and the movement shaked the government off its feet..
The revoultion's secret was realised by the diplomats..
..and considering that it should't bring a disgrace to the govt,
They decided that nothing should be taken care in the Mughor activities
and called it a Dead Zone.
Mughor was possesed by darkness.
A civilization of its own was created.
No limits to the Humans ambitions.
If Mughor controlled India,
Every one wanted to control Mughor.
People killed people and started to
control their areas and operations.
what to do, Bhai ?
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Mumbai</b></font>
<font size="14"><b>spoken in Telugu</b></font>
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Hyderabad</b></font>
If he steps in our area..
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Bangalore</b></font>
That became the Mughor's accpeted law.
Mughor became a Battlefield.
They invited the youths over there to join their respective gangs.
Since then in Mughor, more than 100 kgs of Gold..
A guy with a Pav of Jigar,
was more valuable..
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Surla, Mughor district</b></font>
Agastya..
Do you want anything?
If you want anything, then ask..
I will return.
Bala used to operate a small gang,
He had come to include even Agastya in his gang.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Tilakvadi</b></font>

Even though the gang was small, Bala had big dreams.
First to come would be the big Sharks.
Fearing them, below are the bigger fish.
Below them, are We people..
The Smaller fish.
Earlier three areas were under our control,
But after Bala's father passed away..

Instead of waiting here, pleade 'Sadanand Shetty' and get him to call me,
I will let your guy out.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Tavadi Police station</b>
To atleast save the 'Tilakvadi' that we have,
we've joined with Sadanand Shetty.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Varakked</b>
If we don't bow our head,
Our heads would fall.
We have to control our ego and work only for profit.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Gurr Gunta</b>
He's 'Shahaji'.
Any girl..for how many ever days he wants,
he makes them his slave.
There's no difference between us and those girls.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Guttihaal</b>
He had entred this field last week it seems,
already they have killed him.
Bala had come it seems, is he good ?
He had come asking for my help.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Agadi</b>
Namaskara Anna..
Wondering what trouble he might be into..
You know what's my wish ?
Whatever he asks, do it n give.
These kind of guys, should salute me some day.
I need some Guys now,
I know you don't like all these..
But I do want your help..
Think and tell me.
You have involved Agastya..
For friendship or is he even good at work ?
Instead of just bringing in 10 guys with a moustache..
Its enough if we have One guy with the Guts !
Agastya is like the Coal.
Coal is difficult to ignite,
But once ignited..
It burns till it turns into ashes.
In Mughor, there are many who can ignite.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Nauli</b>
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Nauli</b>
Oye, what are you staring !!
<font size="20"><b>[place]: Karatgi</b></font>
eeaiy, His father used to make me wait outside,
Let him also wait, leave..
Anna..Namaskara anna, I will make your table ready.
<font size="20"><b>[place]: Katt Koll</b></font>
Oye, Anna has come..get up fast.
Agastya.
<font size="20"><b>[place]: Maski</b></font>
Re Manja,
- Anna.
<font size="14"><b>spoken in Telugu</b></font>
Now a days, Sadanand shetty has kept him it seems.
<font size="20"><b>[place]: Varakked</b>
'Prem', Sadanand Shetty's son.
Was giving too much trouble to Bala.
<font size="20"><b>[place]: Shiggon</b>
Anna Govindu..
Move !!
Move away !!
We have to control our ego and work only for profit.
<font size="20"><b>[place]: Nalwar</b></font>
The guy who killed your father.
If he wanted to take a revenge for his father..
He would have entered underworld much earlier.
Did nothing to his father's murderer..
..what could he do for you?
Which fire would ignite this Coal ?,
was the Bala's question.
Shahaji....has come to Tilakvadi.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Tilakvadi</b>
Namaskara Anna.
Sadanand Shetty's dogs means you guys only right ?
Without my knowlege you should'nt hide the good stuff.
You don't know that..!
I would snatch Tilakvadi also from you !!
I haven't hidden anything,
What you want ask me, I will give.
You don't have to give anything,
I will only snatch everything..
Fold your Arms and stand aside !!
Oye, din't you guys listen,
Fold your Arms.
Suma....
You gotta eat the Dose when its hot Anna.
Oh God..Oh God..
Oh God..Oh God..
Just leave..
For the One who has guts even a Pebble is not required.
Have the calmness of Vishnu,
But dont ever forget the anger of Narasimha.
Will you wait till he comes..?
Or shall I only do something..?
Move !!
For that Cruelty or for the Jealousy over Mughor..
Or for his mother's words..
Or for Bala's favour, don't know..
But for the cry of a Women, he entered the Underworld.
You have seen Mughor, even its Rules & prohibitions..
If you obey the Punishment here,
you can't even a build a house out of sand.
If you Punish you can rule an Empire itself.
I accepted the moment you put your arms over my shoulder.
Till you climb the hill and hoist your flag,
I would be standing by your side only !!
But what they realised was that..
In the ocean of Underworld, they were still a Small Fish.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Googi</b></font>
You don't know who I am ! You stop me only !!
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Halki</b></font>
Anna is talking right.
Don't worry for these small things Bala.
would you kill him!
Le, he is Sadanand Shetty's son !
I know, what my son did is wrong.
Cos he killed one of our guys,
would you kill him.
But will tell a truth.
Since he did that, he is Repenting a lot.
Look at him..
Do you see fear in his face ?
We are still not of any importance.
We have not yet raised where we could touch him.
Don't simply raise your temper !
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Varakked</b>
Was behaving wrongly in front of my father,
thought of killing him right there !
Prem, I will talk right..
Be Quiet.
Uncle, the whole Mughor's watching.
If you don't do something now,
all would think of it as your weakness.
You are entering the field Now,
they would thrash you.
Day after tomorrow, they are transferring Bala to Tihar jail.
Sadanand Shetty's men are planning to finish him there itself.
Won't leave you guys also.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Tilakvadi</b>
No, leave this n come..
Even Amma's too sad.
This is a Monster's World..
Can't stay here.
What you are telling is true..
You can't live being a Human here.
Let's become Monsters !
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Benkal</b>
What shall I write ?
What you see in my eyes, write that.
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Tavadi Police Station</b>
It's been 2 months since Ganesha festival..
for what else is their noise.
Coward !
You guys have come putting colors on your face.
Leave that.
Shall I wipe it and put on your Blood !
What for..?
From now onwards, I shoudn't roam putting on a color.
They were still not of importance.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Gudi Beedi</b>
Nobody was there to identify them.
The solution was..
First to snatch back the areas that were lost earlier.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Koppa</b></font>
Agastya..
Where's the stuff..?
- Who is he?
Asking you only, where's the stuff ?
If we won't leave, what would he do it seems?
eeaih, what would he do it seems..?
To tell about 'Us',
we gotta leave someone right.
If he doesn't have a hand, he would tell the story a lot better.
No, No
Dont do anything to me.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Katager</b></font>
Confirm Anna.
Yesterday night Bala snatched back two of his areas.
They have cut a guy's hand and have burnt another's face.
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Tamba</b></font>
But did not understand why did they not kill them.
For Advertisment.
For these silent guys to raise up, there must be a reason right.
This Bala is Rajan's son right ?
- Yes.
Got guts.
That reason's name is Agastya.
Give Suri's Supari to him only.
But one Condition..
have to put a Machette in his neck it seems.
He doesn't come out his Adda, how can he be touched..?
Faizal has challenged that he would get to put a Machette on his neck.
Lets accept the Supari or not ?
What shall we do now ?
Lets put a Ladder.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Nega Nala</b></font>
Lift guys.
Due to Suri's murder, the whole of Mughor got shocked.
So that this kind of Blood shed shouldn't continue,
Dasanna arranged a meeting in one of his areas under control.
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Indi</b></font>
<font size="14"><b>spoken in Tamil</b></font>
Whom did you ask and kill ?
<font size="14"><b>spoken in Telugu</b></font>
Now a days, Dogs which used to eat spoilt Rice..
..are wishing to eat fresh Meat.
Silence !
Earlier we had Unity.
Even after loosing our brother like Suri we have to have the same Unity.
To alert nothing should happen like this in the future,
I have called for this meeting.
Bala,
In our lives, we have seen too much blood.
But then there was a meaning to it.
There was a Count, there was a limit..
..but making it as a Profession is not that easy.
Killing is like having a Cold water bath.
Till you put on the first two mugs its difficult.
After that, one gets used to it.
You only told right..
That all do a Blood shed for their profits.
We are just doing it a bit more.
Don't worry about the Count..
From tomorrow itself we will maintain a Register.
Bala, you only say something.
Agastya speaks means,
Its me speaking.
Oye ! If someone gives you money and tells to kill..
Would you kill me also !!
No.
For you means wouldn't even take money !!
I knew that speaking here would not be of any use.
Giving Respect to Sadanand Bhai's words, I came here.
But remember one thing..
Suri's Supari was given by one of you guys.
Dont keep the Gun some where n al.
If something happens,
It will be reduced.
Wolves in the cave of Mughor..
In the Path of Wolves..
Lion
If the whole of Mughor was floating with colors..
Agastya was ready for the Battle of Blood Shed.
Mine..yours..his..
To decide that the time will be consumed.
Wherever you keep your finger is all yours.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Kakandki</b></font>
By taking Suparis of the Rowdies
who were trying to kill each other,
Agastya took control over those areas.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Benkal</b></font>
Raman Nagarkar wants to meet you it seems.
- Who ?
Ministry of Industries and Commerce.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Gudgaon Industrial Area, Delhi</b></font>
Khadi in the Administration also started to salute.
Jagga and his three bothers
have a control over Bengal's Union from Mughor itself.
You have to control them.
You are understanding what am saying right..
To sow the paddy Pestle is required right.
Done, leave.
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Nalar Vad</b></font>
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Huda</b></font>
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Terrdal Market</b></font>
For the one's who went against Bala,
he didn't even back off to burn their place.
To increase the fear they had created..
Using a Hit squad,
Agastya started to control the devestated Mughor.
Mine..!!
Small Business days are over Khan.
From now, lets talk in Percentage.
From now, lets talk in Areawise.
From 'Karwar' port to 'Darjeeling Estates',
No one was there to stop their Lorries.
Agastya Agastya Agastya..!
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Katager</b></font>
Atleast for my sake tell someone else's name.
Anna Bangalore people,
The 200 Acre party.
Tell that will not take less than 50 Acres.
They will give 80, but should send Agastya it seems.
Anna 'Rathan Sethu' has sent back all the Bombay load.
- From now, will he take from Agastya ?
Wicker to pick the fruits and even to beat the snakes.
Is he the only One !
Have we tied Jingles on our legs !!
Being your Brother, don't I have any value Anna..?
No from now onwards,
Agastya will make the distribution to 'Bombay' it seems.
Careful.
He is growing too much.
As Bala's Glory increased,
even Agastya's also enemies got increased.
Its not that easy to kill Agastya and Bala.
Bring back your Son from abroad.
Fearing Agastya might do something to him,
I sent him abroad and you are saying to bring him back.
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Varakked</b></font>
Sunday is his Birthday right.
Want a reason to make all of them meet at a place right.
Can see your son's Birthday and the enemy's Blood as well.
Prem has arrived from abroad.
For his birthday party, they have invited you also.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Halki</b></font>
eeaih, What are you doing ?
Waiting for him to take his breath.
Anna, you only tell something to him.
Now we have grown right, Leave.
Son, what happened !
Oye, Stop !
After killing my son where are you going..!
To regret.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Indi</b></font>
hey, Why have you come here ?
- was tired of having Hotel food.
He has come here to taste Home Food.
Padma, Where are the guys ?
Don't know, only today no one's visible.
Had to bring back Sadanad shetty's Son from abroad.
So I only had sent him near you.
I sent him abroad n you are saying to bring him back.
Can see enemies blood as well.
If the Aim doesn't miss, Tilakvadi will be yours.
Anna, some one has killed Sadanand Shetty's son.
You have done much to Mughor..
Fearing to loose your grip over Mughor,
you started the game of Chess.
Was behaving wrongly in front of my father.
- If you don't do anything now..
Why are you worrying so much Sada..Savant
- Ha Bhaiyya.
call Inspector Kulkarni.
I might be a bit weak in Chess..
but I play Lagori very well.
<font size="24"><b>[Lagori]: Pittu, Pitthu, Ezhu kallu, Dabba kali, Yedu Penkulata</b></font>
Travel to 'Kashi', I will look after here.
Namaskara Anna.
Namaskara Anna.
You know what's my wish ?
These kind of guys, should Salute me some day.
If you want anything else, then ask..
I will be inside.
No one was there to destroy Bala's Empire.
But amongst them, a Crack was created.
He threatens BalAnna itself !
Not only 'Mallappa' alone,
his family also should be killed.
This is my mother's town.
The work must be completed quietly.
You guys don't have to do anything.
Nayaz.
This only is your Good Chance.
If you kill Mallappa and his family..
You will get a good name in Mughor.
..will even get a better name than Agastya.
Giving tears to the Ladies itself is enough.
They should not be touched.
Should I listen to your words ?
Labourer you're, be like a Labourer !
If this matter goes outside..
..would loose Respect.
If you shut that Door..
..would go and kill your Mother !
If you give birth to a Son, tell him that I was Sorry.
When he grows up,
to take revenge aganist his father's murderers..
..I would've not left anyone.
Don't let him go out.
'Jackie', 'Kumbi', 'Machi' come on lets go.
You gotta leave the place..
Bala will not leave amma.
Would you kill in front of me only Bala..
Doesn't a mother have any value ?
Leave him Bala.
Look..
I will take him somewhere far..
Leave him son.
Agastya, swear over my head that you will leave all this.
Say that 'You will not cross my words' Agastya.
Say that 'Will not step into this Place again'.
Speak Agastya..
Till you say 'Will not beat others'.
Till you say 'Will not come here also'.
For Bala, he shedded Blood like an animal.
But when it came to a female's subject..
He Sacrified everything and stood for her rescue.
Now, only when being a Rowdy Sheeter and signing in the Station..
..those dark days are recollected.
Again he is leading a life
by folding the arms and lowering the head.
Vishwanna.
- Oh, Time's up.
Amma, will go n come back.
- Go carefully n come back.
You don't have a safer place than this.
Came here to say that only.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Vannar Pet, Bangalore</b></font>
I had seen throught my life,
my father creating a fear in other's face.
But for the first time,
saw him sweat out from fear.
Because of Agastya.
I don't know who is he..
I have not yet seen his face also.
- You have a good Luck..
Without seeing his face, many people have got killed from him.
That's why ve called you guys.
I will give you how much ever's needed..
My Problem shoud be solved. 
Anna, didn't come this far for your problem.
But for the one who got you into a problem. 
We don't want your money.
If you do as we say, you'll get the girl.
We will get a chance to drink his Blood.
What should be done ?
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Peenya Industrial Area, Bangalore</b></font>
Water.
I will visit 'Goranhalli Mahalakshmi' temple
and come back by night itself.
You don't take any trouble..
Tell Malla to bring food from the Millitary Hotel and eat,
Ok na.
Be quick..Time's up for the bus.
From the Millitary Hotel !
No chance.
Mother 'Chamundeshwari', when will you save us from this injustice.

Bring tea means, has brought Hog wash, should I drink this !
<font size="18"><b>[Hog wash]: fed to cows, meant as a waste.</b></font>

Take green beans, will be good for the 'Palya'.
You decide what we should eat in our home !!

This cauliflower looks like it has a Jaundice !
Instead of it, you could have suffered from that and died !

Look at his sight, like 'Dandupalya gang' !
You're like a Rotten pumpkin !
You're like a destroyed Copper mug !

Shall I tell you something.
You fight very well.
Shall I tell you one more thing.
I love India.
I will tell you one more thing.
Last, Please.
You told me to wait n see.
I waited and saw.
Do you know what I realised..
You had removed the broken pot much earlier.
Now, I dont have a Regret for coming here.
Destiny has brought me here.
I have liked something over here very much.
I have liked it so much that..
I dont want to leave this place and go..
Do you know what that is ?
Dad.
Nithya was there in this knid of place means..
It's hard to believe.
Don't misunderstand..
The way her life used to be in abroad..
and the days spent over here..
I am trying to match n see both of them.
We will never forget your Favor.
Prepared by me only.
- Prepared by you huh ?
Ayyo, I know to cook all types of food.
I prepare much better than the 'Military hotel'.
You worked very hard..
If we dont do our houseold work, who else will ?
Take.
Our talk was stopped then right..
Will tell you when we both are alone.
First, you take her n go from here.

If I have given trouble to you also ..
I want to..ask something..
But how shall i ask...
You din't have a girlfriend ?
Girl ?
- No.
Why? You din't like any girl..?
They are letting me to get way so easily.
I am not able to believe that.
The security arranged is for the good.

Dheeraj ShivaRudra Lingayya.
Where have you guys kept Prabhakar ?
Anna, he left.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Vannar Pet, Bangalore</b></font>
Where is he?
- Found him, he's in the godown.
But think, don act quick..
Prabhakar has the money.
'Nagappa' is throwing money over there..
Won't get this kind of oppurtunity again.
If we sell our Mill, then also we cant spend so much money..
I don't have any other thought !
He made me spend 8 years in jail..
Dont tell me anything else.
What are you saying ?
What should be done ?
I talked with the Home Minister in the morning..
He gave me an Assurance.
Oye, leave her oye !
Unluckily if something happens to you...
Instead of you, he will make me contest from Shira itseems.
Life long I dont want to be called as a Goonda dad.
Agastya...
They have taken Nithya to Mughor.
What must be done ?
Bring him to Mughor.
Till you say...
My name is Dheeraj.
ShivaRudra Lingayya's son.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Tilakvadi, Mughor</b></font>
Dheeraj ShivaRudra Lingayya.
Had swore placing my arms over your head.
In this place each and every step's weight,
comes to my notice.
You have come for some Deal with 'Thunga',
But why are you sitting in front of me ?
Don't worry..
I will not go anywhere.
I may be having this deal with Thunga..
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Katager</b></font>
But the profit is for both of you.
If you go there..
Hello Sadanand Bhai.
There's a possibility that you might not come back..
<font size="14"><b>spoken in Tamil</b></font>
But if you don't go there..
I know that you will not live for sure.
Agastya is coming to Mughor.
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Varakked</b></font>
He is coming, guys !
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Tangadki</b></font>
<font size="24"><b>[place]: Jamgi</b></font>
He has a lot of favor on Mughor.
He will return that, atleast by burying himself here.
He has shredded a lot of people's Blood.
Many people are waiting to drink his Blood here.
I have created a Maze for him in Mughor.
You can get in easily.
But getting out..
Would only be his Corpse.
Whole of Mughor is united and standing against you.
What will you do ?
Will you guys kill him in one shot..?
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Yangunta</b></font>
He should die being tortured !
Till now, no one has seen his blood it seems.
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Sonna</b></font>
<font size="22"><b>[place]: Karanja</b></font>
Till now, he doesn't know what fear means it seems.
Till now,
no one has bullied him to the gorund it seems.
Today, lets bully him to the ground.
You don't fear, we will not let him come this far.
If he comes..
Today, I should eat placing a plate over his corpse..!
Bring the girl outside.
Agastya.
Agastya's Blood guys.
You told a Monster..
But he is lying over like this.
Oye, take a Photo.
The sun has set and raisen up a 100 times..
But my brother's blood marks have not faded from my hand..
My spite has not ended !
How could you step in Mughor ?
For her..?
We were this much,
when I first saw him.
She has nothing to do with this.
Then, He was like my brother.
His mother was like my mother.
After dropping off her to father,
let's see what's your's n mine.
Till when..!
Till you put a Machette in my brother's neck..
That day, brotherhood ended.
Not later, I wanted it sorted out right now !
We all are sinners..
Let's be punished for that.
But no ne out of us is eligible
to make justice and give the judjement !!
Then why did you give a Punishment to my brother !!
I did not give a Punishment to your brother.
He did not know a mother's value,
So I sent him to take another birth to know that.
I haven't done anything wrong.
If you don't think like that..
Cut me down right here.
Till the muscles and bones are cut,
will not even move my eyelid !
Anna.
Agastya..
If you want anything else, then ask.
Look how you are..
You are tired.
Blood's oozing out.
Even if I draw the sword..
I know you won't hit me.
People will laugh..
That Bala came up with 50 guys and
beated out the helpless Agastya.
Just go.
If you come here again..
There will be no reasons to save you.
Agastya.
'Attige' is very good bro.
<font size="24"><b>[Attige]: Sister-in-law.</b></font>
Just go..
Dont come back.
The markings are done.
The circle has been drawn.
Whatever's there in that circle is
Mine.
Throught my life, I fought..
For values.
For Love.
For a word.
Fought against anger..
Fought with anger..
From now will live a life
by lowering the head and folding the arms.
But if Taunted..
