Let's begin.
Remove from your ears anything that
might impede your transformation
into people in this burly,
ashy river called life.
Yes, what?
- Can I go?
- No, sit and listen.
But I need to.
Be patient.
Start-up capital is what
begins everything.
With it you can start a business
or invest. It's easily lost or multiplied.
The key thing is how to get it.
Today it's very difficult.
But at the beginning of the '90s,
there was a redivision of property.
Today's so-called 'oligarchs'
acquired theirs then.
How?
Back then you could make
heaps of money from nothing,
enough for start-up capital
and the rest of your life.
And there were all sorts
of financial pyramids...
Yes, there were financial pyramids which
emptied the pockets of the common folk.
In a country where everything
had come to a halt,
it didn't occur to anyone that you can't
earn ten rubles by giving someone one.
And there were also criminal groups which
merged with the authorities,
and in so doing,
acquired their start-up capital.
Why do you think
my moniker is "Topsman"?
No, friend, I'm a professional.
I like slicing up corpses...
So, you don't want to talk,
you don't have to.
It's your business.
We're in a free country now.
It just seems to me you're making
life's biggest mistake.
You know why?
I'll tell you.
If you just told us
what's being asked...
...you'd quickly find yourself
among that lot.
But you didn't want to...
But I'm in a good mood.
It's a big day for me.
My daughter started school today.
So, here's another chance
to die quietly.
So, you'll talk?
Shame.
I liked you. And I'll find out anyway,
because I'm a professional.
But you'll die slowly and horribly.
Well, bye then.
No helping some people.
Hands up, bitch! And two steps
away from him! Move it!
- Guys, what's up?
- Lie down, scum.
Take out your cannon with two fingers
and slowly put it down.
Listen, scum, I recognize that voice.
I know you?
I said drop the gun and lie down!
All right, all right, don't get worked up...
what about the syringe?
Hold onto it for now.
- Whatever you say.
- But slowly, so as I can see.
No problem.
Very good. Now you.
- And the syringe?
- Chuck it.
Bastard! I knew he'd try something.
Where'd it go?
Looks like the stomach.
Lot of blood... what are we going to do?
Directed by
Aleksei Balabanov
Ah... you're a cop.
Thought I recognized that voice...
What did Mikhalych
ask you to find out?
Hey, Stepan... We didn't find out!
There...
DEAD MAN'S BLUFF
It's good to sit and have a smoke
like this, after sport.
Smoking after sport's bad for you.
Baklazhan, are they all as smart
as you in Ethiopia?
I'm Russian.
Don't start. Russians don't smoke that much.
Me and Koron smoke a pack a day.
And you... Mr. Health Conscious,
two packs a day!
So stick your tongue up your
black arse, Russian...
Shall we talk business?
All right, let's talk.
Go on, then.
Business is terrible.
Why?
Have a guess. We're out of cash
and there's no work.
It's been a month since
our last escapade.
So?
So? So, no cash and no prospects.
Prospects?
No. Last time because of some
nervy half-wit, we screwed up.
Don't go looking for
someone to blame.
Why not? Someone who thinks
that if he's got a gun,
he can blaze away without warning his
colleagues of this dangerous undertaking.
Don't mess with me! All right, I got worked up,
happens to the best of us.
Not all of us. Didn't happen with Baklazhan
and it didn't happen with me.
But it happened with you.
And you've soiled our reputation.
Now people think we're total head-cases.
And they didn't before?
They thought we were head-cases,
now they think we're total head-cases.
Yes, it's me... Ah.
Cop, that's great!
Work? What's the job?
Right, I got it... All right, tomorrow.
Same place? The Zoo?
Why the Zoo?
All right, then.
- The cop?
- Yep.
- What's he want?
- Offering work.
What's the job?
Who discusses that on the phone?
I'll see him tomorrow, find out...
Why at the zoo?
So no one recognizes you.
We going to steal a car?
We'll walk it. You're getting
a bit slow, aren't you?
What car?
I don't care. It shouldn't stand out,
tinted glass.
Ours or foreign?
I said it shouldn't stand out.
A Lada or a Volga if you have to.
I got it.
Now for the Ethiopian footballer.
I'm Russian. I've never been to Ethiopia.
Cut it out. You can tell a mile off
you were a cannibal.
The guns are down to you. Something light.
With silencers. And a heavy one, just in case.
What?
Just see what you can find. Got it?
Got it.
Good. Let's just keep it smooth this time.
No amateur theatricals. Got it?
What you looking at me for... I got it.
Leave me out of it.
That's all right then.
I need a drink.
Not surprised, after last night.
And you weren't drinking last night?
What you waiting for?
What, you think I'd drink from that thing?
Hang on a sec.
I value my health too much.
I think we've arrived.
Of course we have. You think I couldn't
find the right place?
Who knows with a maniac like you.
Bit nervy, isn't it?
Why get nerved up? Let's go!
What's the file for?
A contract to pass on for a mate.
Oh... you couldn't leave it behind?
Well, just in case.
What you want?
Hello.
I said, what you want?
We're here to see the Doctor.
Is he in?
I'm the Doctor, what you want?
Sergei Mikhalich sent us.
Mean anything to you?
Means something... Come in.
So, what's he want?
I already said I'm not giving
him a cut of the dough.
So don't try and frighten me. I'm already
scared! So out with it, and get lost.
Why're you being rude?
Why're you trying it on here?
They say on TV that the nervous system
gets worn down. And I believe it.
Let's be constructive.
All right, just don't
pressure me. All right?
We won't, Mr. Doctor.
Let's just be realistic, though.
All right.
You're new in this town.
And new in this business, right?
Well...
So you need constant support,
to provide for your security.
Same for everyone,
but we're not at all expensive.
So let's not be rude,
try it on or get worked up,
let's think about your security
and your options.
Options?
I'll give you five minutes to think about it.
The clock is ticking.
We'll go for a smoke, .
Why five?
Too long?
Make it three.
You just have to think...
No, you think, scum,
about not getting slotted right now.
Calm down, lads, calm down.
We can work this out.
Why didn't you say
you had protection?
Do I have to explain to every
freeloader that comes along?
I don't have protection.
Who are they, then? Magicians?
They're not magicians.
Your old man thinks he can come along
and take over the Doctor?
You've misunderstood.
Shut it! I'll do the talking.
I already warned your old fart,
I don't need help. I'll manage.
I told everyone that all year.
But they're all thick here.
Must be the place.
So I'll have to cut into
your demographics.
Any last words?
I think Sergei Mikhalich will be very offended.
He doesn't like shit being thrown at him.
He'll probably kill you because you're
breaking the rules of business.
But you've got a chance.
Tell these halfwits to put the guns down,
put a coat on, it's cold out,
and we'll go and see Sergei Mikhalich.
- That's it?
- Basically.
Then listen!
They really aren't magicians.
Right. No more protection.
Bastards.
Now what?
I've got mixed feelings. Half of me says
we should blow this creep away.
And the other half?
That we should let him live and take him to
Sergei Mikhalich, let him decide what to do.
I prefer the first option.
Me too, but what about Mikhalich?
We'll say he started waving a gun about,
but we were quicker,
and tell him about these two. So?
All right. Doesn't feel right, though.
All right. Let's toss for it.
Heads, we take him to Mikhalich.
Tails, we do him in.
I haven't met a fag
like this in a long time.
Not a businessman,
he's some sort of hooligan.
Get stuffed, freaks!
Bitch.
Scum, eh?
What now? Hope you didn't know
about the gun?
You didn't understand.
I didn't mean anything.
All right. Let's at least take the powder.
Yes, and take it to Mikhalich.
Blood everywhere.
What about him?
Who needs him. Stick him with the stiffs.
Knocked it over and messed it all up.
Everything is spoiled.
Not all of it.
I'll get a box.
Come on, then.
Easy!
Two steps back.
And you slowly give me the box.
All right, all right, everything's cool.
Who are you?
None of your business.
Give me the box.
All right, no problem.
Put it on the trunk
and two steps back. Quickly!
You said slowly, now you're
saying quickly. Which is it?
The box!
All right, all right.
Beautiful!
With your accuracy you should be in the
Olympic team. You're wasting your talent.
I don't like sports.
I don't either.
Tell me, why did you
have to ruin the car?
It wasn't on purpose.
I wasn't aiming at his head.
Where then?
The heart.
Right, not sure about the team then.
Take that former nutter in the house
and you'll pay for the repairs.
Here's a friend for you.
It's going to cost you about
100 American rubles.
You already owe me a car
for saving your life again.
Let's report in for now,
in case someone else turns up.
Main thing is the cops
shouldn't stop us.
Buy a siren.
Very funny.
Mikhalich will cheer us up now.
- Vladik! Daddy's working
- I want to see Daddy.
Ah, come to me, sonny!
It's all right, Eleanora.
You're my sweetie,
Where's Mommy?
Resting, well, good.
So, find Hangman.
He's been missing for a few days, and get
the money ready for the solicitor.
Hangman or no hangman,
we need to do the business.
Have to, so go on.
I understand, boss, I understand.
Everything will be fine.
Hi, lads. What took you so long?
What's in the box?
The Doctor's ears?
Not quite.
Well, tell me how it went?
Sergei Mikhalich, we weren't
entirely successful.
Right. Well, fire away.
We screwed up a bit.
Sergei, do you know
what this word means?
No, Sergei Mikhalich.
Sergei, it means to be between
the vagina and the ass of a women.
See, even Vladik knows, so?
Well, carry on.
We arrived, and he started being rude.
Took out a gun.
And then another two head-cases
showed up. All armed!
Started threatening us. So, to cut it short,
we killed them all.
Tell me, Sergei,
did I tell you to kill them?
You know I need the Doctor?
Sergei Mikhalich!
They started it.
They started it? Weirdo!
If you see the situation's heating up,
just set up a meeting later.
- You need whipping.
- But we...
- Were you whipped?
- Me?
Of course! How do you think
I got this way?
I don't think you should whip children.
My dad whipped me too, and...
I still want to kill him.
And some others...
All right, Simon,
stop talking nonsense.
We came to Sergei Mikhalich
on business... we...
Can't trust you idiots with anything.
Get out of here. What's in the box?
Powder.
What powder?
Some powder there. We decided to collect
it up. He doesn't need it anymore.
- Out of my sight.
- Goodbye.
You see that?
What do you think?
He didn't get too upset.
It blew over, thank God.
Lucky we took the powder.
Yes.
Ah, well done.
Yes, I... What? When? All right.
Yes, I'll remember.
I'm on my way.
Where we going, then?
What do you mean?
Well, for a rest.
Wherever you want, but no striptease.
Or I'll get worked up.
Billiards?
All right, billiards, but a quiet place.
- Have you taken your medicine?
- Yes.
What?
Sergei Mikhalich, we're finishing the fireplace.
Would you like to see?
- Did you study?
- Yes.
- Where?
- The Architectural Institute.
- In the Center?
- Yes.
- Full-time?
- Full-time.
If you studied full-time, Architect,
what's with what you did in the bathroom?
Sergei Mikhalich, that's just the design.
Design?
You approved the design.
The design was on paper, and you can
stuff it up your backside.
I didn't drown you in the bath, but if your
fireplace is anything like your bathroom,
I'll burn you in it, got it?
Let's go and have a look,
Vladik, see what he's done.
Come on, come on, show us then.
It hasn't heated up yet.
Well, it's curtains for you, Mr. Architect.
A game, or have one first?
- Or have one first.
- All right.
Anyone serving us?
What would you like, gentlemen?
The gentlemen would like to relax.
I'll have a salad and juice.
- What juice?
- A good one, but not tomato.
- Nuts and beer. You got pistachios?
- Yes.
- Nice arse.
- Behave decently.
All right, all right,
but what an arse.
Lads, me and my friend
will play in 5 minutes.
We'll just finish, then you.
- Only 5 minutes. We're in a hurry.
- What?
5 minutes.
Thank you.
- Not eating?
- Gone off it.
Oh, I've got an idea.
Not an idea, a bet.
Want a bet?
Depends on what,
and what I have to do.
Nothing much.
We'll play a game of billiards,
and if I win, I'll pay our bills,
and if you win,
you'll pay our bills, all right?
What's the big idea?
The big idea is that we have
two bottles each first.
All right?
Well, I don't know.
I'm driving.
Don't play the Boy Scout! You've never driven
drunk? Is it on, or are you chickening out?
Vodka with food, or without?
You can have some of that salad,
I'll give you a head start.
Ah... Russian?
- What Russian?
- Billiards.
- Well, what nationality are you?
- Russian.
Well, you've answered your question.
Get your cash ready.
All right, but the vodka's included
in the bill.
- And the dent in the car.
- All right.
Oh my word! Well, that's...
Vladik, don't get dirty.
Sliced to pieces.
Hi.
Who do you think it was?
- Who, me?
- Yes.
- I don't know.
- That's bad. Yes.
Right. Vladik, don't make a mess,
what are you... Mommy will be angry.
Phone the cop.
Get him round, have him do the paperwork, tell
him to find out who those freaks in masks are.
And tell him to fill me in immediately,
we'll see who's to blame. All right?
Yes.
There, so, let's go. Vladik, you'll get messy
and your Mommy will be angry, come on.
And tell Sergei to come round
with his colleague.
All right.
You think Mikhalich
will call us in soon?
Don't think he's got anything planned.
What, you itching to shoot?
No, just making chit-chat.
Why bother?
Hello, yes. All right,
we're on our way.
Where we going?
Cheer up, you guessed right.
Mikhalich is calling us round.
Couldn't even get smashed, but at least
you've saved some money.
Not sure who's
saved some money.
All right, let's go.
Waitress! The bill!
So, what you need?
- Firstly, hello.
- We already said hello. So?
- I want to offer you work.
- Work. What work?
Don't interrupt and I'll tell you.
Don't act tough, all right?
I'm not, you just listen to how you
can make some serious dough.
Serious dough?
- Dad, let's feed the crocodile.
- What about the poor mouse?
Dad, the crocodile's hungry.
- We need to rip some people off.
- Rip off?
- Rip off.
- Who?
Do you care?
Not in the least.
How much?
- A lot.
- How much?
Well...
A hundred grand.
- What kind?
- Rubles. Bucks, of course.
- Now we're talking. How many?
- Two.
Two?
Why do you keep asking twice?
You deaf?
I'm not deaf,
what are you mumbling for?
I'm not mumbling.
Calm down. What's the deal?
They'll drive up, go into an office.
Then they come out.
One will have a case.
You take the case and run.
Who are they?
- Well, you know.
- No, I don't.
Nobody serious.
Do it fast
and accurate and it'll be fine.
Agreed. When do we get paid?
Money straight after. You take the amount
we agreed from the case.
Just don't rip me off!
Because I can tell them who did it.
Come on, Copper.
We're honest people.
And don't kill anyone.
Nice and quiet.
All right, don't complain. We're professionals,
everything will be fine.
'Will be fine'. You said that last time.
That was chance, last time.
Chance? Six corpses, that's chance?
Come on, don't hassle me.
I'm not hassling. I don't want
any slaughter this time.
All right, I understand.
You bring the case to me.
Don't screw me! I know
how much is in there.
Round to the station?
You've definitely lost it.
To me, at home! Got it?
Bye.
Halfwit.
And you said it was hungry.
Right. Take that case to the Solicitor.
- To who?
- It's English for lawyer.
Thank you.
What's in the case?
What's in the ca... Listen, Vladik.
Have you taken your tablet?
Yes.
My little sweetie.
In the case, Sergei, there's money.
You exchange that money for heroin,
and bring it here.
- Got it? You can manage that?
- Of course. It's easy.
Well, I have to ask, Sergei, because you can
always screw up an easy deal!
Listen carefully.
You drive over to the Solicitor.
- Eh?
- It's lawyer.
Give him the case, takes the heroin,
and come back.
Sergei Mikhalich, don't worry,
we'll manage it.
Not worry, Sergei?
When you, on a flat space, on a billiard table,
can find a pit of shit and drown in it?
All right, get moving,
and if you screw up again,
I'm telling you, in the presence of this child,
I'll be very upset.
Be off with you.
Sergei Mikhalich, don't worry,
we'll manage it.
I'm working for you, my sweetie.
What've you made there?
A coffin.
A coffin, hey, your Mommy will complain.
You've made a whole cemetery.
You hang on here, lads.
Hi, Cop. What did you call me in for?
I heard, Brain, that you are reckless,
but I didn't think to this extent.
Cut out the cheap talk.
What do you want?
All right, let's talk business. Does the nickname
Koron mean anything to you?
- Where's that scum?
- All right, calm down.
I'm calm, where is he?
I've heard he's wound you up,
and you're still angry with him.
You just tell me where that scum is
and I'll rip him to bits.
All right, I'll tell you. And you'll do me
a favor in return.
Interesting, what favor can I do a cop?
I'm not informing.
There's a case in the apartment
where you'll find him.
You bring me the case
and we're quits. Agreed?
What's in the case?
What do you care?
The case is light, and what's inside
doesn't concern you.
We got a deal?
All right, don't fret. Agreed.
Here's the address where
they'll be this evening.
Come to mine tomorrow.
Here's my address.
Any problem, call me,
there's the number.
- So long.
- Sure.
Until tomorrow.
Halfwit.
We're not late?
No, loads of time. We can even
get a bite to eat.
With a case of American money?
Well, we'll go to American McDonald's.
And eat that shit?
Come on. It's fast and delicious.
The whole world's eating hamburgers.
They're just freaks with no taste.
You want me to eat pies?
Leave Russian pies out of it!
All right, pie-face, we're here.
I'll be quick.
- Sergei, hi!
- All right, Boar!
I thought, is it him or not?
I heard you moved to the Center.
Yeah, set myself up.
Well, I can see you've
worked up a pot-belly.
This is where I keep the brains
that don't fit in.
You still slaving for Mikhalich?
Yes, what've you got against Mikhalich?
You should drop him.
What can you do in the provinces?
Running around like a gopher,
counting kopecks.
These days, you can really do well
for yourself, but not in this hole.
You need to go to the Center,
it's all there.
And your Mikhalich is a gopher. No future.
My boss set him up here,
and he can take him down.
- Can't you go any faster?
- Yes, come on, I'm hungry.
- Good day.
- Coke, fries and a hamburger.
- Sauce with the fries?
- No.
73,000 rubles.
Hey, what about the line?
- Hi, Boar.
- Hi, Semyon.
Where've you been?
He's hit the big time.
Where's your guards?
Guys, our business is legal.
We're taking Eurobonds to Japan.
And you, Sergei, come work with us.
I can help. But you need
some dough to start up.
Here's my card.
You still shooting, guys?
So what?
People don't shoot anymore.
They do business differently,
not like your Mikhailovich.
That was the old days. Remember how
we took the Belozerskies out?
Come on, we're late.
All right, let's go.
- See you guys.
- See you, Kaban.
Scum, eh?
Hang on, we'll do him.
No, let him go.
That's a serious car. I heard that's
the best nowadays.
Come off it, did you see what
the Boar was driving?
Yeah, the Boar's done well for himself.
Here.
What's that?
That?
It's a fly.
I can see it's a fly.
What's it doing here?
You gave permission.
- Me?
- You.
I don't remember telling
you to bring a fly.
You said pistols and something heavier.
I meant a machine gun. In Ethiopia, is
"something heavier" a rocket launcher?
I'm Russian.
Russian, I hope you didn't
bring any grenades.
You're a total psycho. You need
to see a doctor, get sorted.
And I don't think a Russian
doctor can help.
That's your opinion.
Stop stuffing yourself, we're here.
If we screw up this time, Mikhalich will
swallow us whole, crap included.
Stop stressing! No one's going
to eat you or your crap,
and I'm eating because I'm starved.
I can't work hungry.
Stuffing yourself with that crap
won't make you work any better.
That's enough. Why do you
always talk shit when I'm eating?
You could ruin my appetite.
Stop eating. We're late as it is.
All right, I'm coming.
And here are our patients.
- Look, believers.
- So? I'm a believer too.
What god have you got in Ethiopia?
Voodoo?
I don't get it, Koron. You said they'd
come out with a case, not go in.
Yes.
So why're they going in with it?
How do I know.
Go and ask.
And what're we supposed to do?
Like we agreed. We take them
when they come out.
Hello, who do you want to see?
Him.
- You've got an appointment?
- Of course.
- Who shall I say it is?
- We'll manage.
Ah! At last, I was getting worried.
Greetings to the defenders
of the victims of police harassment.
Hello, hello. Everything ready?
Galya, Galya, everything's fine,
the boys are here to see me.
- I've got everything, and you?
- Of course.
- Everything's fine.
- Agree.
Good luck.
Greetings to Sergei Mikhalich.
Bye.
- Give us the case!
- Case?
Case! You deaf?
No, from the fear I didn't
quite understand.
- Hard man, are you?
- Who?
Stand still.
Let's not get silly. Throw the case over,
and you can go.
You shouldn't hang on to possessions.
- You're dead men.
- Ooh, I'm scared. Let's go.
Yes, straight to the cemetary.
You'd best dig yourselves deep holes.
We're finished. Mikhalich'll kill us.
What are we going to do?
We could hang ourselves
or go to Mikhalich, same difference.
Funny. I'll die laughing.
That wouldn't be the worst way out.
So, what're we going to do?
We'll go to Mikhalich and hope for a miracle.
Mikhalich in? In the sauna?
What're you going to say?
I don't know, we'll see
what mood he's in.
You know he burnt his architect
in his fireplace.
Fuck!
You needn't tell me, I already know.
Sergei Mikhalich, they caught us off guard.
We didn't even have time to react.
- You knew what you were going for?
- Heroin.
If you knew it was heroin, you should
have been prepared for anything,
including being caught off guard. Right?
And if you agree, why the hell
did they catch you off guard?
I don't know, I think.
Yes? And what do you
think with, Sergei?
My head.
Up there, Sergei, you've got an arse.
What're you so happy about,
you think with something else?
I should punish you, although this time
you might not be entirely to blame.
Yes.
What're you so happy about?
You light pink poof.
Not entirely to blame doesn't mean
you're entirely in the clear.
All right, numbskulls, listen carefully.
You go and see our copper-informer.
He set us up?
First, don't interrupt your elders,
and second, who said you were set up?
You were ripped off, Sergei,
like suckers, like schoolboys.
And me along with you. Got it?
So you go to him now, and put the frighteners
on him about the heroin.
He knows?
You again, I said don't interrupt.
So, make him talk, and then slot him.
- You can manage that?
- Of course.
And I promise, if it's like last time,
you're history. Got it?
Hey, hey! Oh, Vladik, Good Lord, Mommy will
tell you off, you didn't hurt yourself?
Go on, go on, and don't come back
without good news.
Come here, my lovely,
oh my sweetie,
you big bundle of life.
You already drilled
a hole in your head?
Leave the faith out of it, all right?
Or I'll put a hole in your head.
Oh, maybe you want
to become a monk?
If I hadn't got christened, we'd long since
be rotting in the cemetary.
I don't want to go to the cemetery.
I want, like in the civilized world,
to be cremated.
You'll be burnt, don't worry.
Not long now.
- Wow.
- What's that, Koron? Where's our money?
No money. And this looks like heroin.
Heroin? What heroin?
Same as in Ethiopia.
But what're we supposed to do with it?
- Shoot up.
- Is that a joke?
Give me a smoke.
Two questions. Who ripped us off?
And what do we do
with this pile of shit?
- I've got the same questions.
- And me.
Right. So first, don't panic.
Second, I'll go and see the Cop
and find out what's going on,
and why there's a pile of heroin
in this case instead of money.
Good idea. But are you sure that's heroin
and not coke, or washing powder?
Another good idea.
Seems like heroin,
although I'm not an expert...
No, it's definitely not washing powder.
Gets you going.
No, not washing powder.
You know, I've had a thought.
A thought?
Yep. I'll go, and you think
of a backup plan.
- What sort?
- A backup!
What do we need
a backup plan for?
I think we ripped off
some serious people.
You'll run off to Ethiopia,
but what about me and Bal?
- I'm tired of your Ethiopia stuff.
- Don't.
That's easy, there's nothing
we can do with it.
This isn't 20 grams, it's...
How much is there?
A hell of a lot. About 5 kilos.
Right, I'm off, and you think, think!
- I'll put the case in the oven.
- All right.
Have you gone nuts,
reading that nonsense?
I study English with them.
You go to the monastery
and I'll go abroad.
Who needs you there...
You think the Cop's to blame?
Who else? The butcher bought it.
You got any doubts about it?
- I just can't believe my luck.
- What luck?
I've hated that scum cop for ages.
And if I hate someone, I get nervous
and behave badly with them.
That's bad for business. If it wasn't for
Mikhalich, I'd have killed him ages ago.
All right, Simon, I'll give you
that satisfaction.
- Thanks, pal.
- For you, anything. Any whim.
That's respect.
Just don't get nervy.
There's our beauty.
I'm going to get really carried away.
Yes, pal, you're a real maniac.
You have to respect, and not judge
the weaknesses of others.
Why've you still got that file?
Haven't had time to drop it off.
Hi, guys. You'll be dropping
by the station next.
You could've phoned. What's up?
They could tap the phone.
We need to talk, let's go up.
I hope the police aren't
bugging you yet.
Me too. Come on.
Not living too good.
You saving up?
- Stepan, you got a plaster?
- A plaster? Medical?
Yes, a big one.
In the toilet, in the cupboard,
by the john. Cut yourself?
- I'll go and look.
- Okay.
Hey, you gone mad or what?
Hey, lads! What's it about?
- About the heroin.
- What heroin?
The heroin in the case, which 3 head-cases
took from us. And we think you know about it.
No, you've definitely gone nuts.
Listen, Simon, he says we've
gone nuts. You agree?
D Look at me now. D
Come on guys!
You've totally gone nuts?
Totally.
Quiet, quiet, you'll frighten
the neighbors, filth.
Filth, you should keep the civil peace,
but you're shrieking like a pig.
Simon, cover his mouth.
Ok. Shut it, bitch,
Probably hurts?
I should think so!
You think he's ready
to talk to us yet?
Don't know. Let's ask.
Listen, filth, you ready to talk,
or need more pressure?
Says he's ready.
Open his mouth.
Bitches, what do you want?
For the slow among us, I repeat,
where's the heroin and who took it?
What, Sergei?
I... I... I really don't know...
- Simon, one more time.
- Shut up, bitch.
All right, that's enough.
Open his mouth.
All right.
So, dickhead, that enough?
Or you want some more?
Can we, Simon?
Easy!
There, bitch!
I hope you realize that the only way to go
is to tell us everything you know.
Where's the heroin? Don't hold it in,
or he'll stick a knife in your eye.
- He's like that. Aren't you Simon?
- Totally.
I'll count to one. One...
I... I'll tell you...
See, you can when you want to. And you kept
saying, "I don't know, don't remember".
Go on, we're all ears.
I set you up.
We know that, just get
to the heart of the matter.
I heard the Solicitor was paying you.
I decided that just once
I'd make some easy money.
I really need money right now.
I can see that.
I heard by chance where and when
you'd meet, hired three nutcases.
They agreed to work.
But you made a big mistake. There was no
money in the case. It was heroin.
A whole case of "H!" You know how
much you ripped Mikhalich off by?
Where can we find your friends?
The address is in my coat.
Don't kill me, please!
That is it.
That means he killed the Butcher.
What to do? What to do? What to do?
What to do? What to do?
Just shut up!
Can't you see I'm thinking?
- No, I haven't got x-ray vision.
- Shut up, I said!
All right, all right. Think.
Come up with anything?
No.
How much is five kilos
of heroin worth?
I don't know.
About a million bucks.
Cool, but who's that?
Do you care who's going to kill you?
Yes, we've landed right in it. Do you think
the cop knew it was heroin?
- Maybe. What difference does it make?
- Agree.
You just don't think
about your health.
After today, I don't think
I'll be needing it. You neither.
What are you suggesting?
I suggest getting our skates on,
as fast as possible.
Take this shit,
and hide out till it blows over.
I've been thinking and came
to the exact same conclusion.
Smoked everything up again,
you bloody Ethiopian.
Go and buy some more.
All right, I'll get the cigarettes,
you get everything together.
Koron will be back and we'll have to
move it before we get caught.
Hide the case in the oven!
- Buy a carton.
- Get lost, you piece of shit.
Koron should be back.
Maybe something happened?
We're here.
This looks like the house,
but what floor?
What apartment is it?
- Number 14.
- Second floor then.
- Oh, right, sorry, being slow.
- It happens.
- Bit gloomy in here.
- All right, don't moan, just try again.
- Okay.
Right, we're going in.
We'll tie them up
and start torturing them.
Then we'll take everything, knock them off,
and leave. Should be simple.
Well done, again I'm convinced
you're a maniac.
At last. I'm coming!
Don't get worked up!
I'm not, I'm totally calm.
You should be getting worked up!
- Ah! The Ethiopian.
- I'm Russian.
Careful with him or he'll turn up
his toes too early.
All right.
Tape his mouth.
You're not overdoing it?
Just right.
Why isn't he coming around?
- Black.
- We don't want an international conflict.
- He said he's Russian.
- He lied.
Calm down, calm down. Don't fuss.
He's come round, look, and you said...
Well, Ethiopian, you've got big problems.
You probably want to know why?
I'll tell you.
You took what's ours today,
and we're very upset.
You probably already know that, right?
Guys, guys, I don't know
what you're talking about.
- What's that for?
- You know.
I don't understand.
When you took the heroin this morning, there
were two more contraceptives with you.
You're here alone.
Two questions: Where's the heroin,
and where are the others?
Guys, you must have the wrong apartment.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't want it the easy way,
Ethiopian, that's your problem.
We'll find the heroin anyway. He'll be very
offended, and torture you horribly.
He's like that.
Definitely.
Let's take a look.
Hey, Simon, look at all this vinyl.
Wow! Take a look,
the first E.L.O. Album!
Take a look. Stray Cats! Sparks!
This is a great collection.
When we kill him, you can keep it all.
I'll take a look in the hall.
Brilliant!
D Look at me now. D
This yours?
Simon! Take a look at what I found
in the cupboard!
It's heavy? What's in there?
We'll take a look. You probably want a look
too, right? What's this, a mask?
Or just looks like a mask?
Right, come here! Oh!
You haven't changed!
Hey, scarecrow, take a look.
I'm not a total fool, am I?
We're waiting for another
two gangsters.
What have we here!
Oh! What a beauty.
And what's this? I'll be amazed
if there are no grenades.
This was for us?
Ah, you gorilla scum.
And here are the grenades.
A whole set.
I think you've got no choice now.
You'll have to tell us everything, right?
We'll ask, and you'll talk, but only say
what we want to hear.
Answers such as, "I don't know" or "I don't
remember" aren't accepted. Got it?
D Look at me now. D
Guys... Guys, I... I really don't know
what you're talking about.
As for the bag, the bag, I've...
I've never seen it before!
- First time?
- First time, really!
- Look, he hasn't even turned red!
- Well, he can't, can he?
This looks like it.
All right, brother, you asked for it.
We'll wait for your friends here.
Ah, here they are.
You closed the door?
I don't remember.
Let's get in position.
What's going on here?
The Cop set me up, scum?
Quiet, quiet,
sounds like someone...
Got to break the door down.
I don't like this.
- So that's the way it is.
- Beautiful.
Ethiopian. I've seen you
somewhere before, eh?
Freeze! Who the hell are you?
Don't get worked up kid,
I didn't come for you.
- Kid?
- Scum... Bastards.
I'm asking you kid, who you are?
I'm going to kill you, bitch! Scum.
- Finish him off.
- You bitching, shameful bastards.
Maybe you'll tell us
where the heroin is?
You're finished, bitch.
No, you're finished.
What about them?
A good question. Put them in the bathroom,
but we'll finish with this one first.
Shameful beast... Stinking beasts.
Bitch. The Cop's conned us.
Shut it, will you?
Too much blood? I don't like it
when there's a lot of blood.
Right. You take one leg,
I'll take the other.
Then we won't get dirty.
Heavy.
- Let's get to the key issue.
- All right.
So, we've cleaned up the room!
Just need to find out about this Boy Scout
brigade that was here.
Listen, if you don't switch off your music box,
I'll switch you off. Got that, you long streak of...
- Hey, what?
- Get in.
Hey, man, what?
Someone else?
Right, pups, you're finished, got it?
I'm going to tear you up.
All right, animal, okay?
Where's my heroin?
What heroin, bitch?
What do you want from me?
I don't like name-calling.
You going to use names, are you?
Anyway, let's continue.
I couldn't find the cop.
Maybe he's at work?
Who knows with that filth?
We agreed at home.
I think he knew.
All right, gangsters,
hands out in front.
We must have got
the wrong apartment. We'll be off.
I said, hands out in front.
Come on.
I said we made a mistake.
We're going to a girl's birthday party.
- How old's the girl?
- 20.
What, in our day there are
still girls aged 20?
I'm not a specialist.
Maybe he knows?
- And what's this?
- A bag.
Very good. A bag, yes?
There must be presents
for the girl in it.
What do 20-year-old
girls get nowadays?
Smokes a lot, does she?
And she drives around the region.
And she drinks while she's driving.
Not a very good girl.
- Am I right?
- Not quite.
Not quite. Tie up these perverts.
So, gangsters, I think you realize
your story about the girl won't fly.
So let's not lie or muck about.
Where's our heroin?
What heroin?
That hurts!
I think you know
your prospects are zero,
so let's not waste time,
and just say where the heroin is.
Then I'll give you another chance.
What chance?
Give the heroin back first.
In the kitchen, in the oven.
Good lad. Simon, take a look.
Yes!
Let's have a look.
So, gangsters, my mood's vastly improved,
and, as I promised, I'll give you a chance.
That all right?
We'll play Dead Man's Bluff.
With this, we'll work out who's
a dead man, and who isn't.
Agreed? I'll explain.
One! Two! Three!
Four! Five!
Got the idea?
That was practice.
You, lover of bad girls, come with me to the
kitchen, and we'll see if you've struck lucky.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Any last wishes?
Yes.
Let me go, please.
See, he's got a sense of humor.
That is good. It's easier to die
with a sense of humor.
You need my help?
I'll do it myself.
Unlucky. Let's have the second.
- The Ethiopian?
- No, the Ethiopian later.
You playing Dead Man's Bluff, then?
Yes!
Hey Simon, we've got a hero.
You playing too,
or already crapped yourself?
Crapped myself?
Me? You think I'm not hard enough
to play this nonsense with you?
All right, hero, you asked for it.
Sit down.
Let's see what a hero you are.
Or you've crapped yourself?
You could not shoot,
and just kill me.
But then you should know, you're a piece
of shit and you'll die a bitch.
Now you, scum. You're a great talker,
but now you've crapped yourself?
Come on, you're the hero!
Pull. Pull, you fraud!
You don't shoot, I'll hammer
your brains out! Go on!
They're all good at talking,
but when it comes to business...
Let's kill the black.
I don't like them.
All right, and then we'll go.
I'm getting hungry.
- How are you, brother?
- Damn, it hurts.
- Where you hit?
- In the stomach.
I left my file in the kitchen.
Went out without it.
It's all right. All right, hang on,
hang on brother.
Shit. Lot of blood?
I'm not an expert, but it's flowing.
Hang on.
Hold this on to stop the blood.
- My head's spinning.
- You need a doctor.
- Where can we get one?
- Shall I take you to the hospital?
What hospital with a bullet wound
and a case of heroin? Bring him here.
- You know anyone?
- I'll have to think.
Don't take too long, eh? Please...
Right, right, aha, aha, here.
Hang on, hang on.
Hello, sorry to disturb you.
Could I speak to Alexander?
Oh, Vladik. Didn't recognize you.
What's up with your voice?
Oh, you're celebrating.
What's he say?
I've got one,
but I can't find his number.
Who is he?
A student, from the... what's it?
You know... the medical...
- He can do it?
- I think he can do it.
No "I think"! Can he, or not?
Yes, he can, but not all of it.
All right, phone him!
I'm in a bad way.
All right, all right, I said.
I can't find the number.
Ah! Yes. So... aha. So...
Hello, Lyosha. Hi, it's Simon,
how are you?
Listen, I've got a little work for you.
Well, professional work.
We need to mend a guy.
What's in it for you? Well, 200 bucks.
Write down the address.
Well done for coming.
Don't mention it.
Got the bucks?
- Can I hang my coat?
- Try.
- Not very tidy in here.
- It's not our apartment.
- Do they stop you in the street
in that get up?
No.
- Who are we healing?
- In there.
Take my shoes off?
I wouldn't. It's not very clean in here.
Here's the doctor.
Good afternoon.
Why're there so many corpses?
And it really is dirty in here.
Thanks for telling me
not to take my shoes off.
Don't mention it.
- I'm not in your way, eh?
- Oh, sorry, brother, sorry.
- Lyosha.
- Sergey.
How's things?
Not very good.
Can we get on with it?
Take the rag away.
Put some music on.
- Oh!
- Russian though.
- How is it?
- Not bad.
- It's bad, isn't it?
- No, overall, you're all right.
We'll just get the bullet out.
Get it out?
Well, I didn't think you just
wanted a diagnosis.
- Well, no.
- So, let's get started.
- What do you need?
- Don't get in the way.
Have you done it before?
What?
Well, pulled a bullet out?
There's a first time for everything.
But you know how?
Of course, I've given my Hippocratic oath.
Good to hear.
That's great. Now for the main thing.
I'm guessing you don't have any anaesthetic.
- Anaesthetic?
- All right, here's what I suggest.
I'll give you two aspirin,
and 100 grams of vodka.
Make it 150.
200, whatever... It won't hurt that much,
but you'll just have to bear it.
Don't drink it all.
We'll need it later.
I'll wash my hands,
and we'll start.
So, gentlemen.
Shall we start?
Don't mess it up. I haggled
at the market for two hours for it.
What's that?
Sterilization. Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.
I hope so.
This will hurt. Shout if you have to.
Just don't move about, you'll get in the way.
A keepsake.
- Got a smoke?
- Of what?
- I need a cigarette.
- Oh.
Give me a plaster.
Give me a plaster.
Good lad.
- Anything else.
- Thanks.
- I'll be off then.
- All right, then.
- You can always find me.
- Goodbye.
- You know how.
- Yes.
- How are you, Sergey?
- Not too bad.
That's great.
You know? That's the first time
I've been shot.
How does it feel?
I don't know.
Feels like I lost my virginity.
That's not a bad feeling.
We should clear out of here.
Anyone might turn up
and I'm running out of bullets.
I've got some more.
Here's your file.
To Mikhalich?
I keep thinking about the Boar.
Maybe we should
head for the Capital?
- And Mikhalich?
- He can get sutffed.
I don't get it.
And the heroin?
The Boar said we'd need money
to start up with.
- We need gas. You got any cash?
- Enough for gas.
I took the vinyl.
Sergei Alexandrovich, they've phoned twice.
It's the second reading of the budget today.
- They asked you to go.
- Thank you.
- Katya!
- Yes?
Tea!
Lmmediately, Semyon Yevgenievich.
So, deputy, what can we
make on the budget?
You know I don't take bribes.
Oh, an honest guy...
...and Dead Man's Bluff,
without a file?
I'm tired of you and your file!
Go and pay our taxes, you idler!
Yes, I'll fly in from Burkina Faso.
You don't like blacks.
So, and how long have you wanted
to build a church?
You want to bet that I'll build it?
The price of oil will go up, and I'll build it.
No point in arguing. Oil will go up,
and you still won't build it.
To where is Russia headed, eh?
When freaks like you drive around
with police escorts.
And your sort don't?
Hang on. Oh Vladik, why haven't you
got your hat on, your mother...
Vladik, you should visit her
at the hospital, she's better now...
...yes... oh, he's gone.
Hello.
Vladik, have you had your herbal brew?
You know, I've got this feeling that the Boar
ripped us off with that heroin back then.
It's a thought.
But we shouldn't kill the Boar.
I didn't say we should kill him,
I said he ripped us off.
Ripped us off, didn't,
that's all history now.
Semyon Yevgenievich.
Eh. Oh. Thank you.
Life's become so hard.
