STROKE OF LUCK
¿Fanny?
¿Fanny Moreau?
Alain Aubert.
You wrote for the school newspaper, right?
Yes that's how it is.
At the Lycée Français in New York, yes.
And I find you here... What are you doing now?
I'm... I'm on my way to work. And what are you doing?
I always saw you in the hallways.
- We had the same French teacher. - Mrs. Dufresnes.
I really loved her.
«Dead leaves are collected with a shovel»
I think I hear her saying:
«And also regret and memories»
Jacques Prévert.
That was already Paris.
- Where are you going? - To the office, but...
- Do you work and live here? -Are we going the same way?
As a writer, one can determine his or her work hours.
My dad worked for a French company in New York, so I settled there.
Mine was still at the UN at the time.
- So you're a writer. - You recognized me!
What a coincidence.
Yes, I am a writer.
I wanted to finish a book this summer, but it's taking me longer.
He had already lived in Paris.
- I was married. Long story. - Your articles were very enjoyable.
A great compliment.
- Do you live here? - Yes, my husband works here.
- And what are you doing? - I work for an auctioneer.
-And your name is no longer Fanny Moreau. - No. My name now is Mrs. Fanny Fournier.
And you recognized me!
Of course. I was always in love with you.
- I never mentioned it. - I work here.
- Really? I live nearby. - You don't live in Paris?
No, I come and go. Now I spend more time in London.
And what is your book about?-- Wait, I'm late.
Nice to meet you, good luck with your novel.
Maybe you want to go out to eat someday...
...and remember the old days. - Clear; you already know where to find me.
What is your married name? Fournier?
Mrs. Fournier.
These people from Monaco sell their entire legacy.
Jewelry, paintings, special clothing.
- Did you score? - Yeah.
Let's go to that cocktail. We won't stay long.
Edgar gets us out of town before nightfall.
But we'll stay here, right?
Yes, but Bernard and Chloé are with Pierre Hersant.
- You look beautiful! - Oh yeah?
You look amazing in that dress.
- Everyone gets jealous. - Do not tell me that...
- ...is it too sexy? - "Too sexy" does not exist.
Nor "too beautiful."
- I have something for you. - Oh, Jean!
- How gorgeous!. This is madness. - I love you.
- I like to pamper you. - I too would like.
Don't worry, I spoil myself. Look.
- It is this? - Yes look.
All this.
An old Märklin complex in perfect working order.
- Never an adult... - ... Always a child.
Well. Are we ready to go?
- You do not like? - Yes, but...
...Such an expensive jewel doesn't suit me much.
At first maybe not.
But later they will discover a princess.
And in the meantime, you are my queen.
Póntelo.
You are the most spoiled; You always do what you want.
You don't resist much either.
I'm very vulnerable, yes.
- Are you going to wear the ring now? - It doesn't match the dress.
Isn't it a beautiful ring? - Of course it is...
- ...but it makes me feel uncomfortable. - Always so rebellious.
- Now you are a fine lady. - Shouldn't we go now?
You and your friends are going hunting. I'm already fed up.
You can rest, read, eat well.
- And then the women... - You mean Delphine.
Conceited and materialistic. Nothing more to say.
You've complained enough.
Put on the ring, then you will be the most beautiful of all.
This ring is for a fine lady. I am a rebellious soul.
Your soul worries me. You just have to get there stomping hard.
Am I your trophy?
I swear no one calls you that.
- Jean Fournier and his trophy wife. - It is adorable!
- And smart. - Strongly agree.
A very nice couple, of course.
- He is a lucky man. - And very charming.
Personally I find it very attractive.
And it is wonderfully rich.
Not bad at all, right?
- Brilliant businessman, they say. - And what are you doing?
- Nobody knows the truth about how he earns money. - But what are you saying?
Is there something suspicious in there?
Support charities.
I understand. A kind of Gatsby. Quite inscrutable.
I had... This is what they say...
He had a companion who died in the forest.
He drowned.
They say he committed suicide. Or that they killed him.
- I never heard of that. - I do.
I don't know the story very well, so--
Tell it anyway.
OK. GOOD...
She became known before arriving in Paris. The press said she drowned.
That favors Jean... And I don't know more.
- That's what appeared in the newspapers. - Gossip mongers...
- ...that make our lives a little happier. - It's true.
- Gossip. - Hell yes!
Wow! This one is an attentive man.
- A magnificent ring. - It's part of a deal.
I give her a jewel, and she accompanies me out of town. Something he hates.
I like swimming.
His mother is an adventurer. He is crazy about kayaking, fishing and even hunting.
But not his dazzling daughter.
This weekend we are going deer hunting.
It is very entertaining!
- Can't. - We are vegetarians.
I didn't know! Sorry!
It's not tabloid, but--
Any gossip?
Bored? We're going to the field. - Beautiful, the countryside.
- But dangerous. - I read "Appointment in Samarra."
Great book.
Gracias.
I met someone from school on Avenue Montaigne.
-He recognized me right away. - You still look like a girl.
He said he had always loved me.
And he only told you now?
It was like going back in time. I can't stop thinking.
NY. The best moment of my life. A promising future.
I remember his jeans and his maroon shirt.
If you had told me then, what would have happened?
- I would have had a different life. - And because? Do you want a different life?
I learned it from my first marriage: if it doesn't work now, it won't work anymore.
It's not something specific, but it's something to expect.
I went to an auction...
...where Marie-Antoinette's jewelry was auctioned.
- You bought something? - Yeah.
I wore it to the prince of Monaco's ball. Exit.
Better this way. It cost me some money.
- Are we really going to hunt deer? - Yeah.
- I have no idea if I have the courage. -When I see an animal like that...
...I don't know whether to shoot him.
Shooting a deer that is looking at you...
...it's like infanticide.
- How good is this! - An incredible wine.
- I bought it for you. - I recommend it.
- Culinary trip to Japan. - I'm not a fan of that stuff.
Is it tasty? Our cook is free this weekend.
- Our cook left. - We're looking for someone. But a good one...
- ...Don't you think so? - Don't skimp on expenses.
You have to pay them well.
And Pierre is also difficult.
- Delphine is nice, but she's a snob. - She admires you.
The fact that I support her helps.
Chloé asked me again what are you doing.
Even as your wife, I don't know.
Crazy! Why make so much mystery?
I told you a thousand times.
- I know, but... - Listen.
I administer powers. It couldn't be clearer.
The rich want to get richer.
Less taxes, more benefits.
I help with that. And that's how I won.
And everything legal?
... Yeah.
Largely.
Hello, Fanny, I'm Alain. Alain Aubert, from the school.
Hello how are you doing?
Very good. Hey... I'm near the gallery.
Would you like to have lunch with me today? Or another day, during the week.
Yes...we can...today.
Super super! Look...
I know a good place.
I thought it was beautiful for lunch in the park.
I was just thinking the same thing.
Some sandwiches...
I'm right in front of your office. 12:30? In an hour?
Super. See you soon.
I live here nearby.
And tell me: married, children?
Divorced, no children.
I was married to... you may know her: Anne Sorel.
He went to our school. She acted in "The Alondra" by Anouilh.
I didn't know.
Beautiful girl.
- Actually... - What?
...I fell in love with her because she looked like you.
But it went wrong for you.
You were simple.
Very natural.
I couldn't even look at you!
I feel flattered. And a little embarrassed.
You had a sacred side.
He didn't pay much attention to the boys. In which bank?
- We sit down here? - Alright.
That's how I started dating Anne.
Then we moved to Paris.
We married.
And then reality knocked on the door.
- How long were you married? - Very little.
After a few years we couldn't stand each other anymore.
I never wanted it to become chaos.
I never wanted to return to Barcelona or Paris. And I went to London.
And now I returned to Paris, for my book.
Touched by your divorce.
I always thought: she is going to marry a painter or a poet.
So it was. He was a musician. Very sensitive and very dedicated.
It seems very sad to me.
Jean rescued me. New Year Eve. Now I am the center of her life.
No, of my life!
I would like to talk about it, but I have low self-esteem.
I was very bad then, and Jean helped me.
- Do you have any children? - No.
And what does he do?
It makes rich people richer.
Nice subject.
Tell me about your book.
- Do you really want to know? - Sure, of course.
It takes place in Paris, in a jazz club.
It is the story of a singer and a percussionist.
I don't know that world well.
- I have never been in a club like this. - Do you want chestnuts?
- A bag, please. - Coming out.
The book is actually about the irony of living.
Life as a great coincidence.
- Served. - Life as a sinister joke.
- There it is... - Thank you.
And look at us.
Same school; in love with you; we never spoke...
...And I find you in Paris, on the street.
What could be more ironic?
Are we going to be a couple?
- Me, the beautiful nerd... - I don't want to disappoint you...
- ...but I'm very far from that. - For me you are still Fanny Moreau...
...with her little leather bag and "Anna Karenina" under her arm.
Only now I'm Fanny Fournier.
This is life.
We can't control that.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
If you want, one of these days I can buy you another sandwich.
Yes of course. Call me again.
How well you look! It's good that you came.
- How is the best mother-in-law in the world? - A lot of turbulence. Dizzy
- I couldn't record anything. It was one hell of a flight. - What fun.
-How was New York? - I like it a lot...
- ...despite the winter. - How long will you stay?
Just for today. I'm going to go help my sister after her surgery.
But first I had to go see my dear partner.
We are going to be away this weekend.
There will be kayaking, hiking and, above all, hunting.
You would have liked to come.
But I'm going back. I just have no idea how long convalescence takes.
- What do you bring here? Stones? - They are books for Sophie.
- Don't you use an e-book? - No, I like to feel the book on paper.
Turn pages...
- Shall we eat? - Reassure yourself. Let's talk.
I already know what your mother wants: A Foiue gras and a glass of Château Margaux.
- What a good memory! - Cholesterol and wine. Good combination.
There's new wallpaper in the guest room, and we changed the light fixture, because--
Are there shelves under the mattress?
But how could I forget!
- Very tasty, delicious. - Your mother has a black palate.
Yes, I'm known for that.
- Carolina? - Good night. All good?
Very good. She's my mother; They are Caroline and Marcel.
- We were with them in Corsica. - And this year we plan to go to Polynesia.
Long trip, but sublime.
We have time to combine.
Yes, come. It would be good.
I have been there many times, it is very romantic.
- Well, have a good night. - Have a good night, see you soon.
Polynesia, yes; they do not. She seems unbearable to me.
- He wrote a book about Gauguin. - I can't stand him.
- It won't be because-- - I already told you why!
For all. Because of how he looks, because... And he is in love with you.
But Marcel only loves Caroline!
- Well, he makes an exception with you. - Yes, but not me with Marcel.
It's because he's not your type.
How aggressive!
I find it flattering that your husband takes care of you like a treasure.
Yes, but Jean tends to be quite possessive.
Let's see: if you don't cheat with Marcel Blanc...
...with whom then?
Mick Jagger and Alain Delon are too old now...
...So I do not know.
My foie gras!
- Thank you so much. - Looks great.
- What time are you flying tomorrow? - I'm not going by plane, I'm going by train.
I would have liked to stay longer.
But you are not going to be there.
Did Jean tell you about the weekend?
- They do not like it? - He loves it, I don't.
- Very uninteresting people come. - Aren't they "quality" friends?
Not at all. Very superficial and very rich.
It's all about money and big hotels.
When I talk to them about Rome or Madrid they talk about elegant restaurants.
And I don't like hunting or hiking.
You have to start hanging out with your own friends.
It's just that Jean doesn't like it.
I join Carla, Antoine and Dominique. Always in Paris.
- It's not that bad. - I'm always with him.
He loves you! That is so cute.
And he is charismatic. Much better than your first husband, that loser.
A great change.
Camille, tell me if you like this.
We'll see.
Good huh?
Märklin complex from the '50s.
- Magnificent. - Yeah.
I always loved trains.
As a child, family and friends bullied me.
I got on a train and left.
And look at this.
On board the train to nowhere, I drive into a tunnel...
...dark, sinister, terrifying.
I see the true face of existence.
I see light at the end of the tunnel.
And when I leave, everything changes.
That fragile and anxious child is no longer there.
I'm another.
It's horrible to be bullied as a child.
- You must have been very cute at that moment. - Oh yeah.
- Beautiful park. Far from the gallery. - It's lovely.
What I miss most are the parks on the outskirts of Paris.
I am always behind the wheel.
When I see you walking in that blue sweater, I see my whole life.
See me at school; and you, walking down the hallway...
...as if you were flying. And my heart gallops!
-How is your book going? I want to read something. - Really?
You talk a lot about chance and irony. That makes me curious.
Do you believe in coincidences?
I think that if we are here, eating, it is not by pure chance.
I waited for you for a long time!...
{\an8} Henri Rouger. "The secret Garden". Poem.
- How much is this? - €3.
My favorite poet.
- Always find the right words. - Thank you.
For me, there is nothing that surpasses poetry.
I'm tired of doing nothing.
- I also find you a little gloomy. - Oh yeah?
No no. I'm fine.
Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. It was not on purpose.
When I'm busy, I leave you aside.
I am not complaining.
No, leave it on.
- It seems like it's going to rain. - Yeah.
That's why I thought, since I live nearby, I'd go home and...
- ...there you read some pages. - Of course I would love to.
You are going to cook? Or do I cook?
My gastronomic repertoire is quite limited.
- I make good spaghetti with bolognese. - I'm looking forward to arriving. do I help you?
Of course. You like to cook?
It's delicious. What wine is it?
No idea. A "It was on sale."
Jean only drinks the most expensive burgundy.
Do you like Parisian life?
I love New York and always wanted to live in Paris.
I also wanted to live here, until my marriage exploded.
Then the city tasted bitter to me.
I never wanted to go back to be alone, but...
The beauty of my profession is that you work where you want.
I wrote in Bogotá and Mexico. Even in Montreal.
Very nice apartment.
I found it like this, fully furnished.
I already paid six months of rent.
Perfect for a writer. Bohemian.
I was lucky.
You see it?
If I hadn't found you, my life would be very different today.
What are you doing?
The magic of wine begins to work.
You know my situation.
I'm in love with you. At school in New York; and now in Paris.
I was selfish. I shouldn't have let it come to this.
Then what?
I like you, I like hanging out with you.
And I look forward to seeing you again.
Me too.
But it's not a good idea.
Can I ask you something?
- Are you happy with your relationship? - What can I tell you?...
I ended up in this marriage after a hellish first husband.
Jean arrived, with his energy and charm.
He took my hand, and wanted to get married immediately.
- She loves You. - Yes, but sometimes I feel like a trophy woman.
- And you love him? - Yeah.
Yes I love it.
What am I doing?!
Nothing yet.
So why can't I stop thinking about you?
- Where were you? - In the gallery.
I called the gallery.
- I took a while to have lunch. - And your phone?
I turned it off and forgot to turn it on.
- What if it had been urgent? -Was she urgent?
No.
But I would like to be able to contact you.
You always can; I just forgot to turn on the phone.
- Pity. She wanted to have lunch with you. - I had a business lunch.
- With who? -Some people selling a Basquiat.
Well... A shame.
I had a Japanese restaurant in mind. Where did you have lunch?
... That?
How difficult you are! Where did you eat?!
At... At Café Philippe.
- Philippe coffee? - Yeah.
Very far away. And with the transport strike...
Yes, a disaster.
It's great that you're starting to use this.
Physical condition is very important.
- Hello? - It's me.
- What a surprise! All good? - I don't know.
Tell me. Bluntly. Tell me what's wrong with you.
I don't know why I'm calling you.
I don't feel well.
It makes me happy to hear your voice.
I do not know what else to tell you...
It is a love that has endured for so long...
What else can I tell you?
If you will always be my first love...
- All good? Who called? - When?
Newly. You sounded tense.
- Oh... after training? - Yeah.
A client who likes to ask for opinions.
These are people who don't know how to make decisions.
I make decisions.
And I face them.
- Thank you. How much is it? - €3, sir.
¡Gracias!
How horrible I am at lying!
But I keep lying.
Thank you so much Mrs.
What's that?
Like in my book, I believe in luck. This Friday...
Great giveaway! The probability is 1 in 139,838,260.
That small. But the opportunity to be born here...
...is 1 in 400 billion.
I mean... You already have the big prize.
It is an absurdly unlikely possibility.
Don't waste your miracles.
That is the real miracle.
- I have a lover. - Oh no!
I had to tell you. If Jean finds out, it's the end.
What am I doing? What a way to be wrong!
- Who is it? Or do you prefer not to tell me? - The street boy.
I told you. The one from school.
- How long have they been? - It's not a relationship.
- Are you getting serious? - I'm not going to get carried away.
Many fantasies and feelings.
He's writing a book here.
An advice:
Leave it as soon as you can. Before your marriage dies.
That is what I want. It is an adventure. I love Jean.
But I have something else. I don't understand it and it scares me.
I have to let everything go for him. He's been waiting for me his whole life.
Ironic. Everyone sees you as the perfect couple.
Sometimes I think it changed everything.
And I don't want to give up anything. I want children. I'm afraid.
It will be OK.
Bye sweetheart.
- What are you hiding? - Nothing.
How not? I saw you hide something recently.
- Show me. - No.
- Show what you are hiding. - OK, OK, I'll show you.
- Look. Look what I keep hidden. - A lottery ticket?
How did you get it? Did you buy it?
- Since when do you play? - I read there was a big giveaway.
A big scam!
- Do you know the probabilities? - Yes, they are minimal.
You would have to play all your life,...
- ...for many lives, to win. - Give to me.
- Someone must win. - They always say that.
A big scam.
And why do you hide it?
Are you afraid that I'll think you're stupid?
Honey, I would never think that about you.
Good day.
No, he went out to lunch.
No idea. She said she was going to be out all afternoon.
- It's complicated to come join you. - You do not like? It's far from the office.
Nobody sees us.
Hola.
Eating a sandwich in the park. Beautiful day.
¿Sola?
Reading the newspaper.
Shall I accompany you?
Don't bother, I'm almost done.
Well, have a good afternoon.
Awesome!
- Do you write by hand? - Always.
- And then, by machine. - I am fascinated by the creative process.
I write incessantly.
And I hate reading.
What are you thinking about?
- With you time flies. - Do you still want to return to London?
No. Not anymore.
Nobody waits for me.
No family, no girlfriend.
I feel good here. I like it more and more.
And it's thanks to you. You make everything idyllic.
Frankly, I think I'm going to stay here.
- I said something wrong? - No.
- I'm very confused. - I do not want to pressure you.
- I know. - You're married, it's inevitable.
If you ever make a decision, I'll be here for you.
Good day.
Here.
Josephine, my partner. Take a sit.
Bueno.
How can we help you?
I think my wife has a lover.
And I need proof.
- Because you believe that? - There are countless small details.
Nothing irrefutable, but I feel the signs.
I could be wrong. I hope so. I love her.
And I need to know it.
- Any idea who the lover is? - No, not really.
Many men like her. She is a lovely woman.
Lovely.
Extremely seductive.
I need to know everything about her. And photos, if possible.
How fast is this going to be?
It depends on what she does, but it usually goes fast.
Do I count on your discretion?
Do you really want to know everything?
That's how I want it.
Sometimes it is such a minor matter that the husband does not notice anything.
Then, after the slip, the couple continues and is happy.
Mr. Fournier?
How do you say? Excuse me.
You investigate.
I give you the necessary information and a photo of my wife.
...may you fulfill them, dear Jean...
Thank you all! Thanks thanks!
I'm getting older, but not wiser. And I don't know what to do about it!
We are going to celebrate André's birthday in Venice. They will come?
- Great, Venice, but... - But what?
We would like it a lot. They would take a break.
I was talking to your wife. A very interesting person!
- Thank you. Is that your wife? - Beautiful, isn't it? And very nice.
- I admit it. - Yes. Happy birthday!
-And thanks for the invitation. - No, thanks to you.
- The place is amazing! - We come often. She found out.
We were lucky with our women...
Are you never afraid that someone else likes you?
At first yes, but...
...cheating is something that is not in Marion's DNA.
Although it is a possibility.
Do you remember Olivier Wargon?
He found his wife in the arms of the marriage counselor.
Sad and grotesque.
Marion would never take advantage of me like that.
First, it is not in their nature. And she knows it would be the end.
Imagine them in bed...
...making fun of the poor husband...
- Well... - Back to reality.
We are happy with our...
Have you seen my train complex yet?
Of course! Very impressive. Precious.
- All that fine mechanics... - Incredible!
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.
- Good day. - Hello, Fabrice.
Two glasses of... red.
- What can I serve you? - A beer.
Right away.
I need to talk to Jean.
I need time to think, to organize everything.
I love you.
Tell me the truth, do you love me too?
At first I thought...
...that we were just two friends from school.
But now, all I want is to be with you.
And we met by pure chance. Ironic.
I don't believe in irony...
...not even by chance.
I despise people who believe in luck. That happiness does not exist.
It's a lie.
- I'm sorry. - Clear. It is awful.
But reality is rarely beautiful.
Will you serve yourself a drink?
Who is he?
- It's all in the report. - Cognac, please.
I'm glad things are better, Mom.
Just came. Your room is ready.
Well. I have some pending matters.
I'll explain to you later.
Jean may be arriving. I cut you off. Kiss.
Good afternoon, honey. Who were you talking to?
- My mother. - Coming soon?
- Yes, in a few days. - I can not wait. Is fantastic.
Shall we stay home tonight?
- You were late all week. - Good idea.
I have work pending. You can read quietly.
- How is your work? - Exhausting.
I'm sorry if I seem worried.
It will be all right.
I'm going to make a call. Can you ask me for a cognac?
Suzanne, sir wants a cognac.
- Hello? - Yes, hello.
- You can talk? - Yes, any problem?
I have to see you. Imminently.
Can you go tomorrow at 3:00? In the usual place.
Good. See you tomorrow.
- All good? - All good.
I was thinking about how we met.
The first time I saw you. New Year's Eve at Fred Fox.
With your black dress...
- Recently divorced, unhappy... - I never said that.
...but the first time I spoke to you...
...I was hoping with all my might that you're not a boring fool.
Thank you, Suzanne. You were the complete opposite.
Conquering.
Fell.
Everything you could want in a woman.
- Are you OK? - Yes of course.
The song that was playing at that moment. It's still in my head.
What's the matter? You're crying?
No.
- Nostalgia always makes me sad. - It does not have to be this way.
All went well.
I am the happiest man in the world by your side.
Here is the photo and the address. Let there be nothing left.
Not like last time. Completely removed. And ciao, goodbye.
We got a plane.
When we have it we are going to throw it into the sea.
- This one isn't so nice, is it, Dragos? - Completely.
But killing someone usually makes things better.
More air for everyone.
It's going to turn out well, but you have to work hard.
Let there be no loose ends.
I wasn't born rich. I want to enjoy what I have.
We will solve your problem.
There won't be anything left, right, Milos?
How strange, I hadn't dreamed in years, but every time we don't see each other, I dream.
Strange, isn't it?
Last night I dreamed that we were in Mexico.
Probably because you mentioned it to me.
A simple life with children. We were walking in the rain.
When I woke up I was happy. And I still am.
We share our dreams. They're not that far away anymore.
The poems you gave me... I read them over and over again.
Are good?
The one from Mallarmé, about that stork in the ice. He makes me cry.
We all ended up on the ice.
If we don't protect ourselves in winter.
Before the ice covers everything.
We ended up trapped.
Jean is a fabulous man.
I want to be by his side, have a future.
Sold!
Did the auction go well? - Yes. Jean, I want to--
We are late. Marc and Linda wait. Come on.
- Saint Marteen was destroyed by a hurricane. - There was one on our wedding night.
We have to organize... Where was that meal...?
So are the things. People die.
That's life. You eat, you sleep, you live, you die.
- You feel good? - Everything makes me spin.
- I saw that you drank a lot of white wine. - Then why didn't you stop me?
I'm your husband, not your babysitter.
And we had a good time.
¿No?
That's it
Confirmed?
It is resting at the bottom.
Did they grab everything they found?
Agenda, computer, phone?
Perfect. See you tomorrow at 3:00.
In the same place.
Has the gentleman already left?
He had to leave earlier, and he didn't want to wake her.
He said not to worry. Do you wish something?
- A coffee. Thank you. - Good.
Hello It's Me. Call me as soon as you can. Kiss.
We have to take photos of the Saudi client's jewelry.
- Shall I order lunch? - I already have something.
- OKAY. - Thank you.
Hello darling. This morning you were still drunk.
It's no big deal. I'm going to lunch with a client.
- Where you eat lunch? - I do not know yet.
Well. Big hug, see you tonight.
Let's hope everything is fine. Bye bye.
- You need something? - Photos of Saudi jewelry.
- Oh yeah. Well... - You have to choose; there are many.
I should have, but I forgot.
This is good.
- Are you OK? You seem distracted. - I'm fine.
Do you have to call someone?
- It bothers you? It will only be a minute. - Forward. I have to go?
I've been calling since this morning. Where are you?
It worries me. Call me.
Alain? Are you there?
What happen dear?
- You didn't eat anything. - Huh?
You feel good? You didn't eat anything.
I'm tired, just that.
You're drinking too much vodka.
Eat something. Not good for an empty stomach.
I think I'm going to vomit.
- Are you OK? - Everyone asks me the same thing! I'm fine!
- I'm sorry, but it seems like-- - I slept badly.
Leave me alone.
- Did you arrive safely? - Yeah.
Very good. Now I want to rest a little.
- You look a little pale. -She's drinking quite a bit these days.
- It is not the same. - I do not sleep well.
He works too much. It's going to be OK.
Of course, honey. You are not like that.
- You don't drink, you sleep like a baby. - I'm fine, I'm not sick!
- I won't talk anymore if they continue with this. - We'll leave her alone.
- Let's enjoy this beautiful weather. - Let me breathe.
- Has it been like this for a long time? - No. He works too much. That's all.
- I'll talk to her. - Perfect. She's going to do him good.
- What is it that ails you? - I do not want to talk.
- I see you're not well. - I'm fine.
Stop. I do not know what it is. Jean doesn't deserve this.
Jean doesn't deserve it.
And That Means?
You wouldn't understand. My things.
Do you have a lover?
How did you know that?
I am not stupid.
You're a nervous wreck. Jean blames your job.
You change your appearance, you exercise. It's all very clear.
So who is it?
- He's probably younger than Jean. - It started months ago.
I ran into him on the street. I know him from school.
Are you cheating on a man like Jean?!
You don't cheat on a great man with a loser like your first husband.
He's not a loser.
You have a good time in bed, and you go back to your husband...
...but when you want to break up with Jean, he disappears. She desapears.
- Typical. - But it's real.
He says he loves me since school.
- Maybe something happened to him. - Like what?
Who would hurt him? He is someone calm. A poet.
There was nothing in his apartment. She took everything.
If you had doubts, you could have told me.
- Are you going to go to the police? - I already called.
But they asked me for my information. I got scared and hung up.
Very strange that something has happened to him.
Do I have to go to the morgue to ask?
- It's always a possibility. - Stop. He can't be in the morgue.
I will not do anything. Jean must not find out.
It was like this: I am married and I had a good time with him...
...but when I told him I was going to separate, he left.
Can't you talk to Jean about it?
No. I don't want to play the role of a spoiled brat.
They're over here.
- What are you talking about, so serious? - Do not care.
Well, while they were talking, I had a brilliant idea.
We have some friends in the United States: Jack and Rita Prescott.
They are going to Chicago to renew their wedding vows.
Brilliant idea, hyper romantic. Let's do the same.
Your mom is here. I think it would be nice. What do you think?
- That...? - Like what?
- Let's celebrate our years together. - Nice idea.
Well, you don't say anything.
- You worry me. - It's no big deal. Only...
- Don't you think it's very cheesy? - Very American, yes.
- But it doesn't matter, I like it. - I like it.
I was at a party like that, with your dad, in Brooklyn.
Very touching.
You're right. Very sweet. I'm sorry.
It doesn't have to be the party of the century. Friends from the club will be enough.
I already know what to do...
Thank you for being here, at the renewal of our wedding vows.
Love is complicated. The heart is brutal.
It's about feelings, and moving forward.
- Some love each other all their lives. - That's luck, right?
- Some even renew their vows. - It's magnificent.
Cheers to the newlyweds.
We got married on a boat, on the Dalmatian coast.
We get very dizzy. A bad omen.
- But we're still together. - And dizzy.
These ceremonies make me sad.
A girl we know was getting married.
And they planted it in the church. Her whole family was there.
The bastard of a boyfriend left without giving an explanation.
A month later, in Panama, he married a porn actress.
- Really. - There is often a fear of commitment.
- More common in men than in women. - Or then they leave.
- That's what they say. - I saw a documentary...
...about people who disappear.
And there is evidence of who is behind it.
Aliens.
I swear there are no such thing as boyfriends kidnapped by aliens.
- It is still a possibility. - Now everything is possible.
That ex-partner of Jean's could be living on a spaceship.
But his body turned up in a lake, right?
- Or was it never known? -She disappeared years ago...
...under mysterious circumstances. Maybe she's roaming around in space.
- Or in the arms of a Panamanian whore. -Did a colleague of Jean's disappear?
Yes, it was in the newspapers. Quite a mystery.
They say it was a settling of accounts. I was in the game or something.
They recently said they had found the body.
The police were not sure. I don't think the case was ever closed.
Kidnapped by aliens! The government hides it from us.
Everything is very nice. His friends are all very nice.
- What an afternoon, what a day! - Thanks for coming.
- Now I have to go. - Good night.
Good night darling.
I am broke. Pure white wine, and a little champagne. Now, a shower.
It was a success. We have wonderful friends.
Everyone found you more beautiful than ever.
- You were untied. - Yes, lucky.
- You drank more than ever. - I'm also happier than ever.
- Can I confess something to you? - Confess?
The last months. I was very strange.
There was a lot of work. She was unsure, and I didn't see her.
I have been upset and absent.
But now that's over.
It was wrong. Now I feel strong again.
I thought about it too.
And it's time for children again.
Fantastic.
- Wonderful. - I am very lucky.
You don't believe in luck or chance.
That's because I make my own luck.
¿Jean?
Yeah?
They told me a strange story about a classmate of yours...
...which disappeared years ago.
You too? Who told you?
A bit crazy guy. A certain Gilles.
He says aliens kidnap people.
- And he mentioned that disappearance. - What an idiot that Gilles.
Drunk and out of control. Always with the aliens.
I understand that this is still being talked about.
- People even talk about murder. - It was one or two weeks.
Then they made up crazy theories.
- And what did they say? - I do not know anymore.
Something about our business.
Frankly, Camille, that guy was no good.
Sooner rather than later it would have hurt me. Me!
I work with people, Camille...
Suddenly it disappeared. Matter closed.
What do you think of that?
Not bad.
- Alain would have liked it. - Are you still thinking about him?
Only when I remember he's gone.
And because I cheated on Jean.
- Are you sure Jean doesn't know? - Yes, absolutely sure.
Are you sure about his disappearance? Are there no other suspicions?
Safe; I'm not like you, distrustful.
I am more accommodating. Like dad.
You remind me of that guy who believes in UFOs.
Mother...
Alain didn't go with the aliens. Maybe he was afraid and left.
Why do you ask so many things?
I give space to my macabre imagination.
End the scary fantasies. Read less police.
{\an4} MISSING BUSINESSMAN
DELAUNY DETECTIVE AGENCY & ASSOCIATES
Thank you so much.
Have you finished your book?
I saw your mother reading in a cafe.
So focused, it surprised me.
- What book was that? - One of Simenon.
I read one of his in my entire life. I did not like.
Detectives are always glamorous.
And in real life they leave a lot to be desired.
Outside of cinema and literature, they are stupid.
- Have you ever used detectives? - Yes, for work.
- A lot of deception in the world of finance. - Yes, it must be.
Mr. Fournier recommended it to me. Jean Fournier.
When it comes to infidelity, he's the best detective, he told me.
He had marital problems. All very discreet.
Discretion is the most important thing for me.
We are very efficient and discreet. Mr. Fournier verified it.
I have the impression that my husband is cheating on me.
I want to clarify that.
We need information.
- Addresses, photos if possible. - Yeah.
Yes. I'll bring you everything.
Next time I come.
I need to know how long it takes...
... who much does it cost.
Our rate is €450 per hour.
Well, quite expensive...
...for following Mr. Fournier's lover or wife.
There are cheaper professionals, but here we give the best service
The time required depends on the person.
Of course.
- You have more questions? - Not all it's rigth.
Until now. Thank you.
I'll call you again soon.
- Thank you so much. - Delighted to have served you.
- Thank you and goodbye. - Bye bye.
Hola.
Mr. Fournier. Henry de Delauny. Do you have a minute?
Yes tell me.
A woman came and said you sent her.
She looked uncomfortable... very suspicious. She looked like a researcher.
- Straight, brown hair, glasses. -And what did he tell you?
Nothing. It didn't seem wise to me. That's why I called him immediately.
He awkwardly asked me about you and our work.
I'm sure he won't come back. I will keep you informed.
- But did you say something? - Nothing at all.
But he seemed to know that he had hired us.
If you haven't said anything, it will be fine.
Thanks for your information. Bye bye.
I was thinking about this lamp, for my room after the makeover.
- Not bad. - I met my mother.
-Will he stay long? - I have no idea.
-She is happy in Paris. -And what does she do during the day?
Museums, antique shops. Let's go in and see.
He loves to walk and buy things. Since ever.
The last time we had lunch together you were in Versailles.
Daughter, we have to talk.
Oh my God!. That sounded serious.
I want you to listen to me until I finish talking.
- Well. - Your life is a roller coaster.
- Alain's disappearance... - We're starting!
- ... there's nothing good about it. - how do you know?
At first...
...something clicked with me with that gossip about aliens.
You are crazy?
That gossip about kidnapping aliens made me--
- Mommy please. - It sounds strange, right?
Then, during the conversation it turned...
...in the disappearance of Jean's partner who disappeared...
...exactly the same as Alain.
They found his body. They investigated if it was suicide...
...I don't know any details.
I do. Jean benefited from that disappearance.
Oh yeah?
He disappeared like Alain. Jean got better.
At that time they talked about suicide, kidnapping, even murder.
What are you suggesting?
I suggest this: Jean had a motive and an interest.
Let's change the subject.
- What if Jean knew you were cheating on him? - Mother!
- A suspicion? - Nothing.
- What if he let you continue doing it? - As?
- With a private investigator. - Stop. You are delusional.
- I'm sure he hired someone. - How did you know?
I found a card from the detective in his desk drawer.
- Were you snooping? - I visited that detective.
Supposedly by my unfaithful husband, on the advice of Jean Fournier.
I wanted to hire him.
I don't believe what you tell me.
- It explains itself. - What is explained?
- That Jean made Alain disappear? - It's worth investigating.
Sorry, I'm not hungry anymore.
Wait a minute.
- Listen to me. - No, I don't feel like it anymore.
I cheated on the man who loves me.
Who do I want to have children with?
I cheated on him and, according to you...
...Jean knows it, he doesn't say anything...
- ...and Alain disappears. - Yeah.
- Why were you looking at me so strange? - That because?
- You were looking at me strange. - No no
- Do you feel guilty about something? - Not at all.
Wait, I can't anymore.
Better than running indoors.
They said at work that you had lunch with your mother.
- Yes, but we fought. - Oh yeah? And because?
You already know. Unlimited imagination.
All those detective novels on TV.
Do you think he's getting sick?
From time to time she forgets her medicines and becomes paranoid.
- Sometimes very paranoid. - You have to take your medications responsibly.
- Paranoid about what? - Read too many detective novels.
I already took a shower. Want something?
I wanted to see if you were less paranoid now.
I'm not paranoid.
He knew you were cheating on him.
- Did you take your medications? - All and each one.
Sometimes you forget them. They don't work that way.
That's right, but my distrust has nothing to do with medications.
I love you, but that obsession against Jean.
- Leave him alone, please. - I am not a professional researcher.
And I want to explain it to a professional to see what they think.
- What kind of professional? - No idea.
I think you should go to the police.
Are you kidding? Come and tell that I cheated on my husband?
Look at yourself.
You only think about hunting, hiking, fishing and having fun.
Nothing can go wrong now, Dragos.
- It must look like an accident. - What kind of accident?
It must be perfect.
- Who is it? What kind of accident? - A hunting accident.
I'll take her to a place in the forest. You wait there.
When you see it, you shoot. An unsuspecting hunter.
The hunter saw an animal.
Exact. There are many animals and hunters. An accident can happen.
The police can ask many questions.
I'm giving you a hunting license and a gun. I am taking charge of that.
You go hunting, a tragedy happens and you are devastated.
The gun is yours, not mine.
You understand?
You apologize. The police can't do anything, it was an accident...
...Dear.
I remain on the sidelines, but I will help you.
Yes, but there is a problem.
I've never shot before.
Have you never shot? - No.
It's not that big of a deal. I'll help you.
No, we will do better. I shoot and then I give you the gun.
You need the gun at the end.
Anyway, Dragos, this woman has to die.
It is harmful, dangerous, asks too many questions and is a nuisance. Enough.
- When should that be? - Let's see the place a few days before.
- You will be in a good place in the forest. - And you shoot.
I shoot him, but at your risk.
- It's your job. OK? - Clear.
- Are you going with your brother? He-He went to Bucharest.
- He's living there. A week ago. - Give him regards.
- Didn't you forget anyone? - Pierre and Delphine?
We see you there.
I can't wait to go hunting.
- Camille too, I guess. - Are you going too?
We hope for more success than last time.
- I love it. - We all hunt,...
... It is a tradition. - Let's eat, let's eat.
- Enjoy the food. - This lobster is delicious.
- Do you go to antique shops? - I love them, but I prefer this.
- I was looking for a table. - Enough antique dealers here.
This is going to be good.
It's about the search itself, ma'am.
It is something that is on another level.
Look for. Here and there. Searching you forget everything.
My grandfather was an excellent fisherman, right?
When I was a child I learned to fly fish.
- I didn't learn anything. - Definitely not.
- I'll see you at lunch? - I don't believe it.
But we'll bring something for the night.
But leave the pellets. They are not useful for hunting deer.
What time is it? Wait. I have to take my pill.
So you can see that I remember. Have you seen them?
Aren't they in your bag?
Oh no! I left them in Paris.
- It's a four-day weekend. - Well. So that's it...
- I'm not going to die. - Let's return to Paris.
- I can live like this for four days. - Are they necessary or not?
They are necessary. Edgar gets me. It is not easy to buy them.
Leave. Where are they?
They're in my vest. Sorry.
- It doesn't matter. I go while they hunt. - You want to listen to music in silence.
Edgar drives very calmly. I listen to music in silence.
- Where is the vest? - In bed. It could also be the backpack.
- She's going to find them. - I'm going to find them.
- Come with me. - Be careful.
Bye sweetheart.
This is for you.
Gracias.
Come with me.
- Let's go that way. - Good.
Camille, this is better. I know this forest like the back of my hand.
This forest inspires poets. It's dense...
...and gloomy, but with few deer. Don't worry, the action starts soon
I've been in town too long. How do you keep doing it?
I would feel lost.
I have to do something. I'll be back in an hour.
Let's face it, who buys this stuff?
People who like to hunt?
For an old country house.
Or for the Jockey Club.
Yeah?
Fanny, I have a very bad signal.
Alain did not flee. You were right. Something bad happened to him.
What are you saying?
I am in his house.
I looked for your medicines and came to his house.
I thought about what you told me, and you were right.
The one who emptied the house...
...not the secret place where Alain kept his manuscript.
She would never leave without him. It was the only copy.
It was his life.
I'm not surprised.
Do you still think Jean is behind that?
I can't prove anything. The police should investigate.
Leave that.
Give me your gun.
But, Jean... I know him. It has its flaws...
Listen, I have to go back. We need to talk.
See you later, okay?
¡¡Jean, no!!
Was it a deer?
I think it was a man.
Curse. You're sure?
It was a person. Wasn't it a deer?
A deer...
What the hell is it?
I shit, I shit...!
- You have to ask for help. -No need, he's already dead.
My God, it can't be...!
How terrible!
I saw something moving between the trees.
- It was an accident. - An accident.
Horrible!
She came to the conclusion that this life was uncertain.
The chance that it exists is 1 in 400 billion.
So every life is a miracle.
Every living being has a price in the cosmic lottery.
Don't waste that miracle.
That miracle continues until the end, with coincidences and errors.
It's terrifying to think that...
...chance is everywhere.
And on the importance of luck.
Although it is better not to think too much about luck.
