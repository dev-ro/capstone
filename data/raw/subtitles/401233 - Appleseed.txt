"His tail swept a third of the stars out of
the sky and flung them to the earth.
The dragon stood in front of the woman
who was about to give birth
so that he might devour her child
the moment it was born." -- Revelation 12:4
Just as we anticipated
Hey, let me through
I hope the stun rounds didn't injure her
Captain, Deunan has been secured
She's beautiful...
8 hours and 12 minutes, she's sleeping well
The legendary soldier is so cute when she's sleeping
About your body, will you...?
She will be surprised
when we get to Utopia
Utopia, huh...
Olympus A5, do we have permission to land?
Don't get too close before ID is confirmed
or the Fortress cannon will fire
Olympus A5, come in
Permission confirmed
ESWAT109 preparing for descent
Briareos
I'm going out for a look
I'll go with ya
No, you stay here
Don't worry... I'll be back in a sec
Briareos
Gosh, a detailed inspection?
It was ordered by the Legislative Council
Still sleeping...?
Could we have given the wrong dosage?
Don't move or I'll break your neck!
Deunan Knute, 2nd Team Leader
You are ordered to stand down
Briareos
I can't believe it!
I know it's hard to believe
but it's the truth
So after all this war
nobody won in the end?
That's right
After the Great War, Earth became unified
and central administration "Olympus" took over
That means I blindly kept fighting for months
and it was all for nothing?
That's how war is, right?
But it's different here
Olympus is the realization of the perfect Utopia
Why did you bring me here?
Because you are an elite soldier
Your name was top on the ESWAT list
My mission is to bring people on the list
from the badlands to Olympus
ESWAT?
I know you must have lots of questions
but please take a rest tonight
We'll continue tomorrow
I'll show you around the city
I'm sure, Deunan, you'll fall in love
with our Utopia
Here is your bedroom
I bet you haven't slept on a soft bed for ages
I'll pick you up at 10 am tomorrow
You're Hitomi... right?
That's right
Have we met before?
I'm afraid not
Well, good night!
When did you...
In the battle of North Africa
I lost my body
It's been over one year
This was Carl's...
Your father left it for you
Don't let anyone take it
Call me if you have trouble
Briareos
Out there yesterday...
Do you know who attacked me?
No
What a pity...
Athena, you arranged that attack, didn't you?
You should know that mercenaries couldn't
possibly compete with the ESWAT
Have you forgotten the mission of Bioroids?
If the military found out
General Uranus would surely retaliate
We won't be able to control them by ourselves
Gaia may be reaching her limit
Athena, we don't have much time left
Nike
They've found out
My apologies, Ma'am
Nike
We need our man inside ESWAT
I'll make preparations right away
But the worst of it is
we didn't find what we were looking for
That means...
It's not time to use our last resort
But the fire has to be put out before it spreads
Secure Deunan Knute by whatever means!
Yes Ma'am!
Humans are such strange creatures
falling into their own traps
I never expected a personal visit from Captain Hades
ESWAT is still head over heels searching
for that dummy information
We have now completed 98% of preparations
Perfect
The problem with the special part on the leg
has also been fixed
General Uranus will be pleased
And soon...
The Bioroids will no longer be!
We should not be protecting wolves
Rather, we should protect the sheep
Indeed, that's the principle
of our 1st generation Bioroids
However, some humans are wolves in sheep-skin
No matter wolf or sheep
there should be no sacrifices
What a pity
We've always known the answer to this
Yet we still have to debate with Gaia
Then let us continue our debate with Gaia
Deunan!
Briareos!
Morning, Deunan!
It fits you well
C'mon
Your entry permit was approved this morning
So Deunan, you're now a citizen of Olympus
Beautiful, isn't it?
Compared to yesterday
this is like a dream
From today this is your reality
Everyone looks so happy
That's because 50% of the population
are Bioroids
Bioroids?
Artificially created humans
A clone?
No, not that simple...
Superior lifeforms created from
highly selective genetic breeding
Does that mean this city is controlled by clones?
You know, it's not polite to say "clone"
I'm a Bioroid myself
And despite being superior
Bioroids do not control humans
Bioroids coexist peacefully with humans
and stabilizes the human society
Half of them are Bioroids...?
This car feels weird
It's been installed with the Damysos System
Damysos?
Yes, it's like hovering
They say it can prolong the driver's life
So they've actually completed that technology?
But you still control with a steering wheel?
Because of advanced cybernetic technology
this car is driven by automation
But the wheel is "for the people"
"Functional simplicity, structural complexity
... make humans more human"
How's that?
What was that?
"People first." That's the basic philosophy
of the original architects
The city's landmarks are the Arcologies
There
Tartarus and Daedalus
They contain the I.N. that controls Olympus
central control, the "brain" of the city
I.N.?
"Intelligence Network" system
also called Gaia
Gaia grows with the network,
and monitors everything in Olympus
... especially us Bioroids
Why's that?
Well, humans have emotions
they argue
they fight
Bioroids have limited emotions
we do not hate
we're always in a state of equilibrium
so we'll never start a war
But at the top of Tartarus
is an impenetrable defense system
sealing "D-Tank" which stores a special virus
They say if the virus was ever released
all Bioroids would die
That's the result of human defensive instinct
It sure insults Bioroids though
You're suggesting humans are more dangerous?
That's why balance is so important
Gaia monitors the effect of Bioroids on humans
But it's actually humans who are being monitored
You sound just like General Uranus
Who's he?
Commander of the Olympus Military
an extremist who hates Bioroids
and who is quite vocal about it
Wow, an "unbalanced being" in Utopia
But for the most part
Bioroids run Olympus
Administrative Director Athena is a Bioroid too
Athena?
You know her?
I don't think so
The Administrative Director is like a President
However the military is controlled by humans
Scary, huh?
Recently, ESWAT under Athena has been expanding
Relations with the military has been bad
Now it's gone from bad to worse
But all decisions in Olympus
are controlled by Gaia
Something wrong?
We've got company
Hitomi, you OK?
Yes somehow
But what was that
They're pros obviously
Seems like I'm their target
So it seems
I guess THIS is still my reality
Briareos!
< we cannot unseal the Appleseed >
Hi grandpas! How is everyone?
Hitomi, did you get hurt?
Are you alright?
I'm OK!
Guess who I brought along?
It's Deunan Knute!
So here is the legendary beauty!
Goddess of Fighting
You have Carl's eyes
You know my father?
Not only that
most of the Bioroids in Olympus
have some of Carl's DNA
as his genetic material was used
for the 1st generation models
Which means Hitomi and Deunan are sisters
We heard you met some
um...
not-so-pleasant things
Recently, it's been increasingly complicated
to control the people outside
We worry that the balance will be broken
First, let us introduce you to Gaia
How are my pesky colleagues?
The Legislative and Administrative Councils
have begun confronting each other
on issues such as increasing Bioroid population
It's Carl's daughter that Athena wants, right?
Positive, sir
Everything has been prepared as ordered
What level is the informative source?
Level 5, sir
General
We await your orders
Human souls will no longer serve as tools
for their existence!
So this is Gaia
Gaia is a growing network
which controls Olympus
Gaia consults with the Seven Elders
and her decision becomes the will of Olympus
Gaia is the brainchild of many scientists
who had poured their spirits into its creation
However a machine is a machine
Built for absolute stability
A highly precise, reliable tool
With no emotions, no feelings
Absolutely impartial and takes no sides
Only by interacting
with the Seven Elder's feelings
could Gaia think more like a human
Though lately you seem to differ with Gaia a lot
Our work is to debate with Gaia
The conclusion of the argument
will then lead Olympus in the right direction
Deunan, when you were in the war
what did you fight for?
Well
Human beings will not stop fighting
as long as there are emotions and desires
That's why Olympus was created
The last hope for human beings
is the coexistence of humans and Bioroids
Gaia monitors the balance
Bioroids are totally different from humans
Without the ability to procreate
they can have no offspring
No sex, imagine!
So they do not have love
and with it, no desire
nor hate
However, if their life-extension process
is not carried out regularly
they will age very swiftly and die
We wanted Bioroids to be different from humans
so we suppressed their reproductive ability
shortened their life cycle
Hitomi
Aren't you late for your life-extension?
No problem, I'm going there in two days
We wish someday
there would be a less troublesome way for you
Kudo
Your team are all dead
Still Fresh, aren't you?
Better luck next time
Starting with only 1 knife
she killed 16 men in 10 minutes
Your rookie sure is something!
Did that feel good?
You shouldn't say things like that
They might have to save your life someday
Act like a smartass
and no one will take care of you
We haven't seen each other for so long
and that's all you can say?
Hey, can't you say something nice?
Like "how've you been?"
"nice to see you again"
Someone has an interest in you
I heard that already
But why would they?
Who are they anyway?
I don't know
And what's this "Appleseed"?
I don't know
Stop giving me such mechanical answers!
I'm sorry
Right now, my mission is to protect you
Mission...
Tomorrow we meet at 0900 hours
Well, if it ain't the legendary soldier
the great Deunan
They said you died during the Great War
Your exploits in the war of North Africa was legendary
May I sit here?
Go ahead
Deunan
Carl Knute, your father
Can you tell me about him?
He died before the Great War
Sorry
Your mother?
I can't remember anything about her
My father didn't tell me anything either
Deunan and Briareos were lovers, right?
Yeah, when he was human
though not sure about now
So the body is more important than love
That's not what I meant!
For a man, the body represents sex
By the way
How does it feel to be in love?
You know, Bioroid's emotions are restrained
I don't know what love is
I can learn and read about it
But
I can never feel it
So I become more curious
I envy humans at this point
A woman in love, what is that like?
The feeling of loving someone
You asshole!
You're only a Bioroid!
How dare you get in my way!
Olympus Military
They are so stupid
Always making a scene
Synchro-test completed
No problems found
Now you only need to adjust the safety belt
Before I do, can you clarify for me again
Why the reduction in shock-absorption material?
I already told you
it's the dynamic structure
that itself absorbs most of the shock
But the cartilage has many structures
Joints, bearings, depressor mechanisms
are self-restrained, soft-shelled units
and will dislocate under too much stress
Yoshitsune-kun
This is Deunan Knute, you needn't worry
But I've never a seen a woman
who can operate a Land Mate
OK, let me try
Help me adjust the belt
Deunan
Yoshitsune is the best mechanic in Olympus
When it comes to Land Mates
You should look into Hecatonchires next
Next time, please let me see your inner structure
You better just forget it
I'm blushing already
All secured?
Yep, no problem
OK, this is the ignition switch
First you need to practice
easy does it
That's the way
What is it?
The emergency launch alarm!
Unidentified Land Mates
are invading Gaia Research Center!
ESWAT launch immediately!
What are you waiting for?
Move it!
That's fine. I'm moving out now
Like that?!
Deunan!
Stop!
Here they come
Now target
Deunan
Wait! Don't come this way!
Drop your weapon!
Deunan!
Briareos
Sorry
What mindless waste
3rd generation Bioroids have all been destroyed
DNA systems for the life-extension
have also been destroyed
They entered via the underground elevator shaft
They broke through all 7 levels of Security System
No sign they were from outside Olympus
We don't know who those Land Mates belonged to
This is just too much!
We can only accept human reality
and take on their burden
We have no alternatives left
As of now, seal the entire perimeter
of Tartarus and Daedalus!
No one is permitted to access D-tank
Yes, Ma'am
Call for an emergency meeting immediately!
Deunan
I wonder if you're OK
Hitomi!
Oh no!
You exceeded your life-extension limit
by over three days!
Hitomi!
We are still unsure who owns the Land Mates
that attacked the Gaia Research Center
This concludes the ESWAT report
on the terrorist attack
Please remain calm
and we request for your patience
It is our priority to restore
the life-extension system
There is no need for panic
Administrative Director Athena
Isn't it beyond ESWAT's jurisdiction
to seal the perimeter of Tartarus and Daedalus?
This is the only option under martial law
We are responsible for protecting Gaia
Are you sure it's not D-tank?
Our concern is Gaia!
And totally disregarding our Olympus Military?
I simply chose the best available option
What are you implying?!
Are you trying to insult me?
Please, we have no time to argue!
Councillors
This terrorist attack was
targeted on the Bioroid population
It is a most unforgivable tragedy
If we let things be
all Bioroids would perish from this Earth
However, there is one way to save them
and in turn protect Olympus
It has been difficult to reach a conclusion
We have discussed it with Gaia at length
and Gaia has decided
Gaia wishes for Bioroids to live
by allowing Bioroids to procreate
Regarding the technology for restoring
Bioroid procreative ability
I heard that Dr. Gillian, who developed the
technology, had erased all the data
and thus made development impossible
That's true, General Uranus
If that data was indeed erased
it'd be impossible to redevelop the technology
However, the lost data which we call
"Appleseed" does still exist!
Soon we will find this lost Appleseed
and restore the Bioroid's procreative ability
enabling them to evolve
into a new form of human race
and build a new and better Utopia
Hitomi!
She's fine
She is merely sleeping
Are you sure she can be saved?
As long as we find the Appleseed
And if not?
Her body will quickly degenerate
and she will die within 24 hours
Not only Hitomi herself
but all Bioroids will meet the same fate
I am Administrative Director Athena Reyes
You must be Deunan Knute?
Deunan
Do you know Dr. Gillian?
No
We have been researching for over 20 years
but could never replicate Dr. Gillian's work
If we could get Dr. Gillian's Appleseed
we'd be able to restore Bioroid procreative ability
They can evolve into the new human race
regardless of D-tank
Gaia has made the final decision
Athena
We are all depending on you
Deunan
Please help us
This old disc is our only clue
Is it true that the 1st generation Bioroids
were born in the Research Center
we're heading to now?
So I heard
I wonder why Athena kept
this disc secret until now?
Why did Dr. Gillian try to restrict the
procreative ability of Bioroids?
Deunan
This is a secret operation
and we're about to engage
in a dangerous mission
We need to concentrate on our job
which is to save Hitomi, isn't that so?
You musn't get too distracted
Can I ask you one more thing?
During that Land Mate attack
on your last shot...
Ah, never mind
it's probably nothing
Deunan!
Redon!
Over here
This must be it
Kudo, stand back
Dr. Gillian!
We don't have time!
You must leave now!
Athena, there's still a bit left
I have to erase every trace of data
Very well
we'll try to hold them off
but please hurry!
Mama
What's the matter?
Did we wake you up?
It can't be
What is it, Deunan?
Mother
Deunan, listen carefully
Mama hid the most precious information
inside this pendant
Bad guys wanted to use
Mama's work to do bad things
so Mama had to hide it in here
Bad guys?
Yes
Bad guys who want to take away
Deunan's future
So Deunan must make sure
to protect this pendant
Mm, Deunan will protect it
Good girl
Deunan
But if Athena asks for this pendant
You can give it to Athena
Because Athena is special
I get it
Because Athena is special
Deunan
Please protect the "Appleseed"
Deunan
Do you remember
what it is we're looking for?
Do you remember?
Carl's pistol?
Is Appleseed inside that pendant?
You must be Dr. Gillian
Please come with us quietly
No, don't move!
I beg you, please don't move!
Mama
What's up, Mama?
Deunan
Don't come in here!
No, don't shoot!
Mother
We've got trouble
Olympus military
When did they...
How did they know we're here?
Too many!
They've occupied the dock!
The only way left is up
To the roof!
Alright, everybody freeze
Room D, 5th floor
Redon, you betrayed us!
I've always hated Bioroids
As for the traitor
he's the first one!
Hades
Deunan, long time no see
I regretted I couldn't kill Carl myself
No wonder you and the Bioroids both stink
Even with his clunky cyborg body
You still stick to him
To be honest, I was afraid the seven geezers
might be up to some trick
But trust in your men has always been
your weakness, Briareos
Briareos, what's going on?
Let me tell you, Deunan
The one behind the terrorist attack on Gaia
...was Briareos!
Remember my Land Mate escaped
because he missed?
Because of him, many Bioroids died
Is that true?
Answer her, you dog!
Or I can just shoot
Come on, give the pendant to me
Deunan!
Hurry, to the roof!
Hurry!
Kudo!
Go!
Stay there!
Keep away from me!
Deunan, give me the pendant now!
They want the pendant, not you
This was what my Mother
protected with her life!
You knew from the beginning, didn't you?
You knew everything
Deunan
Deunan! Now you realize
the true identity of that monster
Deunan Knute, I am Senator Uranus
General Commander of the Olympus Military
Carl was my old friend, so was Dr. Gillian
I still remember when you were a child
We don't want to hurt you!
Just hand over the research data to us
We intend to overthrow the Legislative Council
Destroy D-tank and eliminate all Bioroids
And take back the society
that should belong to us
But the data in your hand would
undermine our plan
I request that you hand it over to me
Sorry, but I refuse
Deunan!
Deunan
Olympus is no longer the Utopia that
Carl and Dr. Gillian had envisioned
Father had forced me to learn combat skills
since I was young
I never understood why until now
He wanted to keep the pendant
from people like you
General
My Mother told me
I could only give this pendant to Athena
Bioroids aren't worth your trust
They want to take over humanity
Maybe they are not to be trusted
Maybe they will take over humanity
However, one point still holds true
A Bioroid and another Bioroid
will never kill each other!
General, we are wasting our time
Deunan, you disappoint me
Athena was trying to protect humanity!
So were Carl and Dr. Gillian
They tried to hide the Appleseed
in order to protect humanity
They wanted to prevent
the rapid evolution of Bioroids
Because Bioroids are dangerous!
Not true!
To continue Dr. Gillian's work
Athena has been evolving Bioroids gradually
General
Bioroids have always protected human society
The reason I helped Hades
was to help Athena delay the evolution process
She wanted to keep
Deunan's lost memories lost
Athena wanted to keep
the secret from her to the very end
My mission was to take
the Appleseed to the Seven Elders
Thus I was assigned to protect Deunan
If so, that pendant must be destroyed!
General!
Don't you think it strange?
The Seven Elders don't just want Appleseed
They want to destroy D-tank using Appleseed!
There must be some important reason
why Athena is protecting D-tank
General, don't allow D-tank to be destroyed!
Briareos!
Don't be fooled
He's nothing but a pathetic machine!
This is revenge, Deunan!
Can you imagine the hell I went through
after I was expelled from ESWAT?
This is my revenge on Carl for getting rid of me!
I will kill all Bioroids with his DNA
I will kill ALL Bioroids!
Hades
Deunan, it's not my fault
You should blame your father!
Sorry
Don't talk
Although I have the latest Cyborg shell
I still feel pain when I'm hit
Please, you mustn't speak
I've always wanted to see you
That time when I was dying in the battlefield
I just wanted to see you one more time
Then I was saved by the Seven Elders
I thought, if only I can still protect you
Nothing else matters
It's alright, I know
I ended up becoming this monster
I'm such an idiot
You haven't changed a bit
You're still you!
But now I can't protect you anymore
I won't let you die!
Deunan, no human --
Briareos!
No human will be sacrificed
That's what the Seven Elders promised
but they were secretly up to something
Go
You must go now
How can I leave you here?
The future of this world rests in your hands
I don't need a future without you
Deunan, don't let your Mother die in vain
Enough, don't talk like that!
Deunan --
Briareos
Briareos!
Briareos sent an SOS signal when he got hit
Awesome! The inner structure
of a Hecatonchires is really perfect
The tissues are restorable
We might be able to save him
Please save him
I beg you!
There should be enough fuel for the trip
It has the Damysos System installed
Flying should be more stable now
The center of gravity may have some offset
but 60 deg rotations shouldn't be a problem
Deunan
Even we Bioroids
still have a few feelings left
Please save Hitomi
Deunan reporting. Mission accomplished.
Well done
Deunan
Deunan, good work!
Finally we can restore Bioroid procreative ability
Now Hitomi has the same life system as humans
Thank goodness, Hitomi is saved
I'm so glad
There's no need to worry anymore
Deunan
Was it you who killed my Mother?
Did you order my Mother's death?
Deunan, please forgive us
that was an accident
If Dr. Gillian was still alive
we would have more options now
Why did my Mother hide the Appleseed?
Dr. Gillian gave us our only hope
For the survival of the human race
the coexistence of humans with Bioroids
was the only solution
but humans never gave up fighting
they despised superior races
with a vehemence
the human race could no longer run this planet
they have discarded Dr. Gillian's ideals
According to Gaia's prediction, the human race will
be destroyed along with Earth in 3 generations
Deunan
it's time for the human race to step aside
Step aside?
We humans must pass the future of Earth
over to the Bioroids
Dr. Gillian's virus
will play the most crucial role in this plan
A virus developed by Mother?
Yes, at the top of Tartarus
sealed inside D-tank
this virus will destroy the procreative ability
of human beings
No sacrifices from the human society
Human history will end peacefully
This is the euthanasia for humanity
My Mother objected to that
She objected to the rapid evolution of Bioroids
So you killed her!
There used to be two options for Olympus
Coexistence with Bioroids or
the evolution to the new human race
To make a right and fair judgment
Gaia was created
Dr. Gillian poured her spirit
into the creation of Gaia
Gaia functioned according to her ideals
If Gaia disapproved
it would be impossible to release the virus
Then the Great War started
and this planet was turned into a wasteland
The once grand Olympus became like this
Nothing but mere rubble
General Uranus and his hatred towards
Bioroids only added to Gaia's anger
So Gaia has made the final judgment
To use Appleseed to make Bioroids
the new master race
And erase humanity from history
You used me
You used me to make Briareos listen to you
You used us to trick Gaia into deciding
Gaia is a hoax!
This is the fate of humanity, Deunan!
When I press this button
D-tank at Tartarus will explode
The virus will spread throughout the world
That's quite enough, Elders!
984G come in, immediate action!
That button is of no use
What do you want, Athena?
To prevent the destruction of humanity,
thus Bioroids were created
Have you forgotten that?
Bioroids were programmed
to obey human orders
We are no longer Bioroids.
We are now the "New Humans"
Athena, this is Gaia's decision!
Her wrath upon Uranus' rebellion
The punishment for human atrocity
General Uranus gave up just a moment ago
He is now seeking to coexist with us peacefully
The General did?
Gaia should have known all these things
Deunan, Gaia's spirit no longer exists here
Gaia's not here?
The decreasing hostility of humans
Gaia should have reconsidered
But the Elders stopped Gaia
and forced her to their will
Athena you are indeed clever
The New Human is perfect
In stopping Gaia, your life-preservation system
would have been affected also
Right. We will step out of history
along with the human race
The cannons are moving...!
Mobile Fortresses are proceeding towards Olympus!
The Mobile Fortresses will target
the top of Tartarus
No one can stop them
Deploy all ESWAT Land Mates
Engage full emergency alert
Target the Mobile Fortresses
Stop them at all costs!
The defense system of D-tank
is indestructible, right?
If hit by the cannon at zero distance
even it will break
A powerful sword against a perfect shield
Which will triumph?
It's a tragedy to worship power
At this speed, they will reach
Tartarus in 15 minutes
Have civilians been evacuated?
Evacuating, Ma'am
That's our top priority!
Once the Fortresses enter clear zone,
attack immediately!
No.7 Mobile Fortress is the control center
of all the other Fortresses
Hitomi!
Hitomi!
I am sorry, grandpas
If you shut down the control box inside No.7
all Mobile Fortresses will stop
But DON'T destroy it!
No.7 has to be shut down manually
The access code is H-I-T-O-M-I
Briareos!
Deunan, we had a deal
Deunan, what are you waiting for?
Move it!
You won't make it!
Human race will perish with the planet
Deunan, the human race cannot be saved!
And let the New Humans
bear the sins of the human race?
We will survive
even if it's not a Utopia
Our future is in our hands
and I WILL hold onto it!
Deunan!
Impossible! They have no weaknesses
2000 meters to Tartarus!
We can't scratch them at all!
Captain, we're approaching No.7!
Cover us!
Where's No.7?
The one in the middle
Concentrate our attack on No.6 and No.8!
How about No.5?
Leave it!
All fire on No.6 and No.8
No.6 is stopped!
Good
How about No.8?
Over there
I'll divert its attacks
Deunan, you approach it from below
Roger
Briareos
Deunan!
The Mobile Fortresses have reached Tartarus!
They are climbing upwards!
Deunan, we're out of time
No.3 Fortress has reached the top!
We can no longer stop it!
How come?
What's the matter?!
Briareos!
Deunan, LET GO!
I told you already
I CAN'T do that!
Hurry, input the access code!
Mother!
They've stopped
All Mobile Fortresses have stopped
D-tank is safe!
Briareos!
Deunan!
Hitomi!
What about the grandpas?
I see
So...
That last letter of the code
It's up to us
From here on, they're leaving it to us
In the end, nothing has changed
It must be our unwillingness to change
that makes the human race guilty
Yet I will continue fighting,
even if it's like this
For our children, our next generation
For a truly new "Human Race"
