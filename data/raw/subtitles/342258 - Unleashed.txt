(Unleashed)
M?talos.

Atta Boy.
If you must money for me, one assumes
that you must pay to me.
Pay I, the Collar has left position.
You do not pay to me, the Collar loosen.
It is very simple.
Lev?ntate.
Quiet Qu?date!
To see.
We will be back.
Come on Danny Boy.
I dreamed Last night …
It was seated in a house…
… Umbrella, those
in order to decorate drinks.
And there was a beautiful girl
with the golden skin…
… dressed only in one
short skirt…
… that adjusted to its skin.
And the girls went and came…
… and one of them brings a drink to me.
A Coco milkshake.
And as soon as it brings the drink to me, happens to me
the teats by all the face.
That wonder!
Hey head, seems that Georgie
he is a little excited.
Shut Up Lefty, you are the one get
the fuck enough, not me.
Well, that is the aim
of the best part.
After the girls, everything went
to the excrement.
She appeared that Joe Mumpet with
a machine gun…
… and it began to destroy it everything…
… leaving not more blood and
corpses by all sides.
That it dehorns!
The real nightmare.
Good looking that you never had
a dream truth?
It must have been peaceful.
Hey, have a little this.
Hatred the dreams.
Hello old!
Righty, bastard!

Hello head, all good.

Excrement.
Atta Boy.
- I go away.
- Hey, Natham.
She is either head, is or.
Is this what wants?
Mant?n the ready car
and it pays attention.
- Good luck.
- We did not need it, friend.
Sabes what is most fascinating of
this situation, friend?
That basically you have turned
to a man in a dog.
Good, it is like my santa mother
it used to say…
… “Ag?rralos of young people
and your possibilities are infinite. “
At this moment I am
like you.
Then, we are going to see if
I understand.
I do not pay to you…
-… and you remove the collar to him.
- Correctomundo.
Him extractions the collar
and it strikes until killing.
Vaya, that shining mind!
Then it is of my interest
to maintain that collar on.

Kill Him!

Taste in seeing it, Mr. Youssef.
M?talos!
- Something Found that pleases to him.

Pretty puppy.
Atta Boy.
Not who you are created?
It seems that I was not well clear.
Ll?vate which you want.
No, you do not take me by one
of those pigs…
… like some people
that I know.
I only take what
he corresponds to me.
But this time…
Yes.
… I am going away to take what wants.
Because your you are a damn bastard.
Vamonos.
- That you are watching?
- I only enjoy the spectacle.
Well.
Does not return to me to leave single!
But you said that I had left
in the car.
C?llate!
Sube the car, stupid idiot!
I cannot believe it! They gave one me
beating that almost kills to me…
… having a dog, that it does not have
brain to protect its master.
To beat to them, to bite them, to piss them…
… something you had done
by the love of God.
- Jesus.
- Head, that does not see itself very well.
Another original thinker.
Perhaps head, we would have to continue…
What follows?
- To the house of antiques.
- Well. We go then.
Is sure that it is
well for this?
If you leave to that it does not pay they turn
all in “original thinkers”
Let us pass first by a pub.
I want to drink a “premium”.
Judas piece of excrement!
It leaves.
Well, this it is the plan…
… I am going to try to solve this
of a pacific and professional way.
If that is not
we will have…
Oye, quick attention!
When it pushes east button…
… this red light will begin
to blink you understand?
If the red light blinks,
you enter by that door…
… fast, attacking…
Saca your hands from there!
And you it lets bother.
If the red light blinks…
M?rame, conc?ntrate.
If the red light blinks,
you enter by that door…
… he is everything what you must do.
you understood?
Light, door!
It hears.
You do not clear the eyes of the light.
And you do not fail this time to me.
- Georgie.
- Yes, head.
- That of there Hangs.
- There above?
Ready.
The light Danny, the light.
Red it means enters.
Understood?
We go.
It seems that there is somebody here needs my aid.
Hello how are you?
I am only going to sharpen these pianos.
I will take two hours.
If it does not bother to you.
You like the pianos?
To me also.
The problem is that this piano
it is a “Leka”…
… and it is as if there were
bought a “Chest”.
Probably it would need everything
a month to put it in conditions.
You know, to sharpen pianos is
a hard work…
… and my back is not
what used to be.
You are making something important?
Because I really need
an aid here. You can?
Please?
You are there still?
You are there, truth?
If
Well. They see.
You know, much people thinks that because
a piano is so great and resistant…
… you can touch it of the way
that you want…
… and nothing will happen to him,
but it is not thus.
The pianos are like
the people…
… if you treat them bad, of they desafinan.
The same with a piano.
I strike it and…
Listening this.
… it sounds like a baby crying.
I am going to you to say what
I want that you do.
When it says “presses”…
… I want that pressures these keys
beginning by this of here…
… and following towards the right.
One, two and three.
You can do that?
Very well, now
it puts your hand here, thus.
Oh, by God! Delay a little.
You are very tense…
… relajate a little. Ves?
Music must float
of the piano you know?…
… if it cannot float,
it cannot stay signs.
Here and there.
Only relajate.
There is nothing no to fear here.
These ready?
It presses.
More fort.
Thus, again. Well.
Esc?chate. You have a great one
talent for this type of work
Well, it presses again.
Presiona!
Wonderful. Once again.
Ready?
Presiona! Presiona!
It drives the pedal.
The USA your soul. It lets leave
the magic.
Either, very or.
Excellent, excellent.
Please, it waits for a little.
- Quieres to see what we obtained?
- If.
It listens to this.
This is the sound or no?
- Yes.
- Quieres to prove?
Dame your hand.
Pon the fingers there, that is.
Thus.
Next shutdown:
“Carnegie Hall”.
Sabes what is “Carnegie Hall”?
It is a very famous place
in New York City.
All the great musicians want
to touch in “Carnegie Hall”.
I also wanted.
When it was growing
that was my greater ambition.
But never I was a good musician.
- You are well.
- If.
Well.
As you are called?
This good. I will call to you “without name”.
My name is Sam.
Enchanted of conocerte.
Either, very or.
It tell me a thing, Mr. “without name”…
I am oyendo a sound
like “click”…
You hear It? Or simply it is…
I am going to you to sell.
That is what I am going to do.
If you are not going to do what I trained to you
in order to do so that excrement I have to you?
You are not to me of any damn one
utility. That is the answer.
I raised to you, I fed…
… I gave a ceiling you.
And I wasted my time.
A effort in vain.
The man who raised to you…
… he is furious reason why it has received.
Mira how I am!
It seems that I was in
World War I.
Outside here!
Takes it to it of my Vista!
We go small dog, we go.
I am becoming old
for this excrement.
We go dog
Entra!
Entra there!
- I am occupied!
- I am making It enter.
- There is a type that wants it to see.
- I finish saying that I am occupied.
It says that it has a proposal
of businesses for us.
It said something on the spectacle
of today.
- M?ndalo to carajo.
- I already did it.
It is well.
D?jalo to enter.
Who excrement will come to joder.
Dejennos single.
I listen to it.
It was an impressive unfolding
of its man today in the jewelry shop.
I assure to him that it was
totally justified.
And surely that was it.
That of the collar. Brilliant.
And the object of this
conversation is…?
The object of this conversation is…
… that I would like to offer to him
a lucrative proposal.
- So lucrative What?
- Very lucrative.
Contin?o?
Please.
It is an entertainment that adjustment
every month for friends…
… only for members,
I do not know if I explain myself.
And we always walked in search
of new talents.
The first fight is a test…
… by that it will receive 15.000.
By second, 20,000 plus
percentage of the bets.
A person who receives the commissions…
… and it bets to itself can
to gain means million in a fight.
Clear. That in case it wins.
- And to win?
- To fight until dying.
Enchanted from which it has come.
Please, s?game.
Where is the money?
Good, the money comes later.
After?
After overcoming it to him,
our present champion.
Invicto in 15 fights.
It would like a glass of
champaigne?
Is difficult, ah?
M?talo.
M?talo. And express
damn stupid idiot.
That is my boy!
- Thanks for the opportunity.
- It was a pleasure. Very impressive.
- That of the collar how does?
- As my mother used to say…
… ag?rralos of young people and your
possibilities are infinite.
It was Jaswett that said that.
Probably it listened to it
of my mother.
If it needs, knows to me where
to find me.
Surely that we will have it this way
again.
Only that I would like that the next one
time is a little more entertained.
I will see that I can do.
Recuerdas that dream that you
I said had had?
That of the girls.
- Yes.
- Yes, it memory.
Finally I understood.
Sabes who is Freud?
- No
- It does not matter.
Freud was a genius, and said that when
you dreamed something, that meant another thing.
Yes.
The girls, the islands, the drinks,
they are all symbols.
What truely they represent…
… it is our comfort, tranquility,
not to have preoccupations.
And this type comes and us
it offers more money…
… del that we could win
in 20 years.
What can be clearer
that that?
The dream, the money. It means
that it is hour of which retires to me.
- Entiendes?
- Yes.
Not more casts…
… not more extorsion.
I will say something to you…
… I feel very well today.
And I feel generous.
Danny what you want?
- A piano.
- Disculpa?
- I want a piano.
- A piano?
By God!
What so a place to have supper?
- I want a piano.
- And that so a woman?
- You never were with one.
- I want a piano.
- Danny, you begin to get upset to me.
- I want a piano.
That is what it pleases to me
of you, Danny.
Four words and already you said everything.
For that reason we make a good equipment.
I am the brain and you them muscles.
I will say something to you, this one is going to be
a spectacular day.
Vamonos!
Good day young ladies.

They have had much patience stops
to hope to me, ladies…

You know, the other day when I returned
to house I told of you Victory…
… she is my hijastra. I told everything him on you.
Hello? You still do not say to me that
you are sleeping.
Good, if I awoke
in one stranger marries…
… using the pajamas of another person…
… he would be quite nervous…
… and it would try to hide to me in
place more surely than found.
When he was young, the place more surely
of the world to hide to me it was…
… just there where you are now.
Feels well surely there, truth?
I thought that if a person is two days
without eating one would awake very hungry…
… asique I brought a little to you
jam and mantequilla.
My name is Sam you remember?
Tomato your time.
Neither Victory nor I will do to you
questions…

It is not six years old.
But it seems as if

It likes to write, to draw?
I do not know anything on him.
Good, only one thing.
It likes music.
What good.
Hello. Sam said to me that

It was of my papa. It passed away
before I was born…
… and soon my mother me gave it.
But she died in an accident…
… but before one had married with Sam,

I am speaking too much?
Because I do that sometimes.
If uncomfortable you

… simply you warn to me.

It is not much, but…
My name is Victory.
- I am going It to look for?
- No, it leaves comes single.
- Perhaps it does not know how.
- Then we give the opportunity him to learn.
Nothing like the own learning of
to become as a child to man.
- How you know if never you had a son?
- It spoke by personal experience…
-… you do not forget that sometimes I was young.
- You do not say to me.
Yes, I say to you.

that we are going to eat…
… thanks for La Paz that there is
in this house,…
thanks for another day of
health and happiness…
… and, please…
… beam that Victory is a successful
tremendous in its concert of piano.
One assumes that you cannot request
those things.
Who said?
You were. From small that you say to me
that that is one of the rules.
You say that never I said to you about
the special exception…
… for the piano concerts
important.
Ah sure exceptions!
And I am created it.
I know, likes more when you agree
yet what I say.
I will use a little as soup.
- There it comes.
- Good…
… you arrive at just in time.
This it is your place.
They see, si?ntate.
- Victory, you could…
- Ah, insurance.
Sam cooked this. He is his world-wide
famous soup of Popes and vegetables.
“World-wide famous”.
- This is your napkin.
- Bread?
No, it watches. This is a spoon.
This is your spoon.
Thus, it watches.
A dueto.
My name is Danny.
We will not put the dressing to him
again…
… we cannot more do.
It seems that it is cured.
It was about to to ask to you…
… what is this?
It is well, is no problem.
I do not go to quit?rtelo.
When he was young had
cattle tender hat.
I slept with him, ate with him,
he bit it…
… and if somebody me it tried it to remove,
it had the same reaction.
It was thinking, you have been
here by…
… some weeks…
You would like…
… to breathe a little fresh air…
… to stretch the legs.
He is pretty outside.
It is well
in here.
You are scared to leave
and that you cannot return here.
You will return, you I promise it.
To tell the truth, I need
little of your aid.
With the pianos?
Accompanying Victoria
to the school.
Taken care of with the path.
- It is here.
- Listening, we will come by you to 3.
I have 18 years, Sam.
- And all one average week and. To 3.
- It is well.
- Good bye.
- Good bye.
Good bye.
- You are well?
- She kissed to me.
If, already I know it.
How was?
- Humid.
- That is everything?
- Pleasant.
Humid and pleasant. Thus it is like
a kiss feels.
We go, we have much to do.
- Hello wanted!
- Good day, Mandy.
Mandy has the best supermarket
of this zone of Glasgow.
- Mandy, this is Danny.
- Hello, Danny.
He is a little timid.
I like that my men
be timid.
That does everything a challenge
for the girls.
Only queria to teach the 5 keys to them
in order to make a good purchase.
Never fu?ste a good teacher.
It is certain.
My mother took two rocks and one cup from
water and made a food for 3.
Asique when I already had
sufficient age…
… it gave the secrets me
of the good kitchen…
and now you I am going them to teach
to you.
You are ready to learn the secrets
of the good kitchen?
- Yes.
- Well, we begin then.
- The fruits speak.
- The fruits speak.
You did not know it, truth?
- No
- The fruits speak.
They will say everything to you what
you need to know…
Everything what you have
that to do it is…
… to learn the language.
We will take this melon,
for example…
… what you think that it is saying?
Yes, but also it is saying
“I am Already mature”.
- Sabes what means “mature”?
- No
“Mature” it means “candy”,
and “candy” means “good”
The kiss was mature.
No, the kiss was sweet,
the melon this mature one.
But mature it means candy.
Good, but that if you are
speaking of fruits.
The kisses are a notion in case
same, the kisses are… complicated.
So far only llev?monos
this melon.
The good bread is fresh.
It smells.
-, Yes fresh.
- Fresh.
Well, it brings breads.
Very well, now the part comes
difficult. To cook.
In that closet there is a great pot
and round. Me you could bring?
Yes.
When you are cooking, the food
it speaks to us in another language…
… that we listened
with our language…
… like the flavor.
It watches these beauties.
If!
One knows that it has good sausages
when they know thus.
You found something truth?
D?jame to see.
That is Victory when
she was baby.
This is Victory with its mother.
His father was my better friend.
It passed away before Victoria
it was born.
Her mother also was
my better friend…
… for that reason, after he
it passed away, we married.
Then there was an accident
when Victory was seven years old…
… her mother died and I
I lost the Vista.
Victory remained
with me.
The form in which is strange
our family formed truth?
- You have family?
- I do not know it.
Surely that yes. All have
a family in some place.
Not them memory.
Perhaps someday you do it.
The pots are here.
- Earth to Danny!
- Sam sent to me by you.
Single? It is a great day then.
We are going to celebrate.
- What is that?
- “To celebrate”, it means that beams somewhat special.
Sam said that fueramos direct
to house.
It walks, we go.
Thanks.
This it is a cone,
and this is frozen.
Sometimes you ate ice cream?
- No
- Good, this is frozen of vanilla, and is white.
Vanilla is white.
We go, pru?balo.
No, only dalo returned
in your mouth.
Oh, by God!
Sabes a thing of ice creams?
First he is cold and later sweet…
… and if you are never congealed the mouth
you will be able to savor the sweet part.
- Then, we are going to do it thus… - Sweet it is good.
, Yes certain.
Sight, you lick it…
… something thus.
Also.
How is everything?
Sight, you have stained yourself
by all sides.
We must worry to us.
We go.
- You are well?
- Yes.
Fast Term?natelo.
If Sam asks where we were
d?jame to speak to me.
If one finds out that we ate ice cream
before the supper…
… one is going away to anger by the one of
appetite, you understand?
What is “appetite”?
“Appetite” is what you are not going to have
if you have the full ice cream stomach.
- How is my mouth?
- Pretty.
No, she is not pretty.
She is full of apparatuses.
But not for a long time.
Strange to your mother?
Every day.
You strange to your mother?
Nonmemory to my mother.
Sometimes I believe that it would be
easier not to remember.
- Hello.
- Hello.
They arrive behind schedule.
It was a so pretty day
that we decided…
… to take the long way.
I did not say to you that they came
direct to house.
Sam, is my fault.
Not of him.
If you wanted to take
long way, Victory…
… you could have gone to that
school in Kansas…
… where you could take a way
of 50 km and it would not matter to me.
- 50 km of maize fields!
- The maize is safe.
The maize is boring.
In addition this school is better.
And for that reason we are here and no
with cereals, correct?
Hazme a favor,
you do not make worry me.
It is well, Sam.
- What is that?
- What?
It smells of ice cream.
- Ice cream of vanilla.
- Vanilla is white.
First he is cold, later sweet.
Sweet is good!
Victory…
Yes?
… sometimes it worries to me this
boy.
It is as if something or somebody had
closed its heart so strongly…
… that with himself not to enter
contact with him.
He is that what treatment to do.
With vanilla ice cream?
I believe that we would have to think
in a different strategy.
- Good night.
- Good night.
They see.
When she was small, it used to do this
with my mother and Sam.
It was when I discovered
that I liked music.
Ves this of here?
- “Notes” are called.
- Notes.
- The notes are signals.
- Notes are signals.
Well.
The notes are signals.
Then, you see this note here?
It is the signal to touch this key.
And this one of here, this key.
And this one, this key.
Well, now you are going to touch…
… and you are going it to make more express.
Very well prepared?
Now I go.
It follows, noneven.
She is not mature.
- Hello Sam.
- Hello, Mandy.
- How goes the lessons?
- They go by the best way…
Well mature.
Here bastard Ven!
Went away this way, express!
Take hold it.
Where is Danny?
Danny!
She is mature.
Largu?monos of here.
Danny!
This one is mature.
Danny, you remember when I said to you…
that neither Victory nor I would do
questions…
… because the moment in which would arrive
you would be ready to give answers?
- I decide to Me.
- Good…
… after which it happened in
supermarket, I need some answers…
… that I do not believe that it is going to obtain
without hacerte some questions.
- Is well?
- It is well.
In the supermarket,
men were fighting.
- Sab?as that, truth?
- Yes.
- But did not bother to you?
- No
- You were not scared?
- No
Generally the people
before situations like that…
… they feel fear.
To my they do not scare to me.
One more a question…
When you arrived here
you were seriously wounded.
How is that it happened?
I requested a piano.
To whom you requested a piano to him.
To my uncle.
Then yes you have family?
- No
- But you finish to me saying that you have an uncle.
He is dead.
- Is good this?
- Magnificent.
Oh, God!
These making the ridiculous situation.
It is not for as much.
We are going to remove a photo.
- Sight, seems a globe.
- Where is?
- There same.
- Yes, where it must be.
- Hello, I can enter?
- Yes.
- Where you learned that?
- What thing?
Music that you finish touching.
It is what I hear in my head.
T?cala again.
It is difficult. Somebody must to you
to have taught.
- You do not remember.
- No
Surely which it was in your other life,
the one that you had before knowing us.
I do not know it.
All yours
he is new now…
… your clothes, your hair,
all your life.
This is the latest…
I believe that it is hour to leave
the last thing back.
You do not create?
Everything what there is in you
he is new now.
Good night.
Friend, we go away a
to amuse much.
Very either, very or.

Yes, well, of it is there of where Victoria

- No, this one is only one temp house.
We only came here so that Victoria
it could go to that school.
What I mean, Danny,

… after Victory graduates
we will return to house.
We are going to return to New York.
And… not how decirte

Oh, affection.
It happens that sometimes…
… to be happy it is not sufficient.
Sometimes the people

they must solve the things by themselves.

Money by sex.
When this woman
she appeared this way…

I liked your mother.
It included/understood to me.
If it had had somebody special one,
she had been she.
When she died…
… I replaced it…

Sight, this is a photography
of her, it watches.
Excuse haberte lain, Danny…

that you made me lose the other night.

You know, Danny, sometimes in the families

really irreplaceable.

You know, that type of woman.

Good, it is touching the piano.
What plus has in the photo?
There is a group of students
in uniform…
… and a great window
with vitr?.
It seems a music academy
or something of the sort.
There are two great pianos
at heart.
What class of great piano?
“Pleyel”, both.
I have one devises.
Excellent work did with
pianos of the conservatory.
Thank you very much, lady.
The last tuner that we had was
always drunk. He did not have time.

A disaster.
Danny.
Although I see so many faces
every year, never forgetfulness one.
Specially this.
- What had this face of special?
- A shining girl, absolutely…
-… the best one of the class.
He was destined to excel.
Then a day she
simply it disappeared.
Pensabamos that had returned
to its house…
… or that it had received some news,
or that had money problems.
But later a family
of China she wrote to us…
… to know its whereabouts.
It had a small son…
and everything becomes strange there.
A sad history, the truth.
Ah! Here it is.
- You are well?
- I am well.
- Surely?
- Surely.
It is well.
Hello.
Boys? Sam?
Danny?
One assumed that you would go to me
to look for.

That woman said that she was
an excellent pianista.
Surely that was it.

of the sonata N? 19.
Your mother not only touched music,
she touched beautiful music.
Magical music.
An excellent music.
Excuse that it bothers it, but really
I need to know how where to find it to him.
I have never seen it in my life.
D?jeme to ask to him again.

Everything is in your account.

Sight which you do fact of that.
Those likeable people
they let to you enter…
… and they gave everything you.
And it watches how these paying to them,…
