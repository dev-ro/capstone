'Thank you for your support
in this heroine oriented film, Nivin'
To 'Narasimham and Rajamanikyam' of
Malayalam cinema and fans, THANK YOU'
To all who stood by me,
when life became topsy turvy...
...specially you, Abraham Mammen, thanks
- Jude Anthany Joseph & Midhun Thomas
To the girlfriend who deserted me
with such precise timing...thanks!
What?
I'm told cigarette smoking
is injurious to health
No one smokes in this film
I am also with you
'OHM SHANTHI OSHAANA'
'It was those years when Mammooty
and Mohanlal ruled Malayalam films'
'Kunjacko Boban was
only 7 years old'
'Studying in 2nd grade'
'Dr Mathai like other doctors, entrusted
his wife's delivery to another doctor'
'And paced the corridors
fully tensed like this'
Aiyo
Ummaaaa...!
Razak'kka, where are you?!
Indecent buffalo! Didn't I keep
protesting, you just didn't listen?!
Did you come back from
the Gulf for this, you rogue?
Which one of you is Mathai?
- Me
- You have a baby boy
That's awesome!
A girl baby would
have been problematic
As they grow in years
you burn with anxiety
Until you get them married
you don't know what sleep is
Worse is when she
elopes with someone
When you are old and tottering, no one
to give you even a glass of water!
You won't have
such problems now
Praise be to the Lord
Sorry, there was a mistake
Your baby is a girl child
Praise be to
the lord, once more!
'This is her story'
'The story where she swam and
splashed in a river of tears'
'The story of the wicks
of pain she burnt away'
'Hey you! Is this some kind
of mega-serial announcement?'
'It is my story
I will narrate it'
'Go ahead'
'This story is a little old
It begins in the last century'
'Not so far back in time
1999, that's what I meant'
'Yes, this is where it starts'
'My name is Pooja Mathew'
'And this is how I looked
when I was in my 10th grade'
'See this photo?'
'The house you saw
just now is mine'
'This is my room'
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born-"
'This is my papa
Mathew Devasya'
'Mathai doctor to the townsfolk'
'Papa's world revolves
around my mom and me'
'Recording his own songs and
listening to them is his hobby'
Wow!
'He believes, if one is a doctor
one must discover at least 1 drug'
'So he has a lab right within
his consulting room at home'
Annie!
'Yes, Annie
She is my mom'
'She is a college lecturer
But a simple soul, poor mom'
'She loves to cook
while I hate the very word'
'Trying out new recipes and
eating it blissfully is her hobby'
Wowww!
Sit with your feet together, girl
'I should have been born a boy
is what mom always says'
Girls should not
whistle, my dear
Catch
'Papa says I am
a girl just like a boy'
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born-"
Where is it?
Can't find it
Look here, dude
'Mom! Foods!'
Why don't you take it
from the kitchen?
Sorry, kitchen is
a place for women
Oh! Look at this tomboy, eh?
See you later, doctor!
'My school principal
has great regard for me'
Can I find you a house
close to school?
Why, teacher?
Then you won't have to drive that old car
all the way here to solve her problems
'The local vicar too'
- Do you know who this is?
- My daughter
No! She is anti-Christ
'It was during those days of tomfoolery
Kunjacko Boban's film Niram was released'
'When everyone was looking
at his handsome face...'
'I was looking at
his 'down under'!'
'I swore on St Anthony that
I won't ride on public roads...'
'...and persuaded papa to
buy me a super CBZ bike'
"Blue sky spread with green
leaves of coconut trees"
"White milk of brown cow-"
What, man?
Haven't you seen
a girl ride a bike?
I will ride a bike, change gears
and even ride with free hands...aiyo!
Why don't you stick to
stuff you are capable of?
'The fall that day
was a pain in the face!'
'My face sported a strip of band-aid
in all the photos in Julie's function'
Quickly
My turn
We'll go there
and click...come
'I came face to face
with reality that day'
I wish this proposal
clicks, dear lord
This will click
Very good family
Moreover, dowry is 200 sovereigns
of gold and Rs 2500000 in cash
'200 sovereigns of gold
and 25 lakhs in cash?'
'God! Who is this 'item'
these people are buying up?'
Hi!
Yuck...!
'After seeing Julie's guy
I was very sure of one thing'
'Girls don't have any say
in marriage matters'
'When you hear me say this
you must think I'm a good girl'
'But I have a secret'
'This is my aunt's house'
'Rachel aunty
I call her wine-aunty'
'Aunty is an expert wine maker'
'Not wine made in
just 10-20 days'
'If you order now, it'll be delivered
in 4 or 5 years, special wines'
'Grapes, pineapples and lots of
other stuff go into brewing it'
'I always get to taste first
every wine she brews'
'I am her official wine taster'
Aunty
'She likes me very much
And I like her too'
'She can tell me anything
and vice versa'
'Best friends'
This is the fate of all women
No matter how educated
or how beautiful...
...she has to finally marry
the man her family chooses
No one in our family liked
your uncle when I selected him
But now, see how
happy everyone is?
It's always best to
marry the guy we like
Or we'll have to force
ourselves to like him
'I decided that day
I'd find my own guy'
'Boys at school
were not my kind'
'Either book worms'
'Or incorrigible flirts'
Hi Pooja
'But there was one boy'
'In B-division, Yardley'
'His surname is a bit old fashioned
Avaran...Yardley Avaran'
'But he's really a dish'
'Soon after deciding
Yardley is my Mr Right...'
'...Kochouseph Chittilapilly
walked into my life'
'He built Veegaland water theme park
and our school arranged an excursion'
'Usually during school tours some boys
sit next to girls with 'other' intentions'
'When Yardley sat next to me...'
'...I thought he had
mischievous intentions'
'But his behavior
actually stunned me'
Hi Pooja
Nice song, isn't it?
Hmmmm, huhm
You know my family, don't you?
Kalathiparambil
My father is a doctor
and so is yours
I will grow up to
become a doctor too
You too will become one
I like you
You don't have to say anything now
Think over it and tell me tomorrow
Okay, see you
'Dr Mathai, Annie
Dr Avaran, Elsie'
'Monthly income
Ours 1,20,000...theirs 2,00000'
'Pooja...Yardley
After MBBS 150000'
'Fair kids-2
plays the guitar-1'
'Feasible!'
Hey guys, look at all the fish
Just watch me now
- Shambu'annan's number 1
- Get lost, you dog
Shambu'anna,
you're really a tiger
What is your problem, man?
How dare you accost me?!
Let me go
- Now slap her butt
- No, bro
- Come on, slap her
- No, bro
Run
Take me with you, guys
Pooja?
What have you decided?
'You know, when we meet
the person we like....'
'...kind of cool fuzzy feeling
spreads inside your tummy'
What did you say
your name was?
Ya...Yardley
Ah yes! Yardley
When I see you
I don't get that feeling
Sorry, okay?
'For the 1st time I met a deadly guy
I wondered who he was the whole night'
'Next day I met him again'
Road side Romeos!
- Sweetie, come
- Get lost, man!
Come on
- Go...go
- What is it, guys?
God! It's not starting
- Go home, dude
- Sure, we will
Fill fuel in it
and bring it home
'For the 1st time
I missed the school bus'
'I had no idea when
the school bus came or left'
'I just kept thinking of that guy'
'Something else happened today'
'Papa bought me a mobile phone'
'Nokia 3310
Superb phone'
'I had told him
I didn't want one'
'But it turned out to be of
great use to someone else!'
Hello?
Okay, I'll give it
Here
This is my friend, Neethu
Hello, sweetie
1 minute
'This is my other friend, Donna'
'They are my best pals'
'Neethu will love 3-4
guys at the same time!'
'And Donna can eat 3-4
stuffed pancakes in one go!!'
'Even while I sat with them
my thoughts were on 'that' guy'
Why are you sitting
and mooning like this?
I'm hungry again
Ah! Yes! Kanjyani!
David Kanjyani
'I forgot to tell you this'
'He is my cousin
David Kanjyani'
'Mischief maker, flirt and someone
you'll never let into your house'
'An item born to bring
disrepute to the family'
'He's an expert in
the vanishing act'
'When in trouble
he'll disappear'
He will appear when
everyone has forgotten'
'1st time he vanished
was when...ah! I remember!'
'He was once an altar boy'
Pray with all your heart
'This is something
all altar boys usually do'
'But this was not
why he vanished'
'Once the High Priest visited our parish
for the first and also for the last time'
'Kanjyani who vanished that day
reappeared 3 years later'
'KANJYANI HOUSE'
'He went to the Bishop's house,
fell at his feet, only then...'
'...was he allowed into
the church and house again'
'Come quickly'
'Come here all of you'
Adept at taking
money...vagabonds!
Don't forget
It's on Sunday
You have to say you are
from Jose'ettan's house
Do you follow?
Will you say that?
Here
Now go
New business
Religious labor supply
- What?
- Religious labor supply
The day before Sunday church festival
our Reverend has ordered...
...1 member from each house to
take part in the circumambulation
Where is the time for our people?
So I have arranged a proxy
They will happily go
for the circumambulation
Our people will
sleep at home, drunk
How's that?
You don't have to carry the cross
Muthuraj will go instead of you
Just have a few pegs
and sleep at home
Why are you here?
The other day when a guy came to
the bus stop, all of you ran away scared
Who is that guy?
Him...huh?
Giri
I wasn't scared
He is not a good guy
Typical thug
Used to be a communist with
an arrogance that accompanies it
He is an enemy to
bourgeois like us
Don't even look him in his face
Giri?
A thug?
Who told you this?
He is comrade Madhavan's son
who died long ago
Graduated from St Thomas
Now he is an agriculturist
He likes that
The other day, fed up with those boys
I asked him to come to the bus stop
Why are you asking me all this?
See you, okay?
Giri?
Great guy
Gives blows for blows
And respect for respect
I can go anywhere with him
He is a tiger cub
We must change
the brake lining
It will cost you hundred
no, a thousand bucks
That much?
Of course I have to
change everything
Okay
Lord, may this kid never sell her bike
and may she always bash it up!
Doctor, what shall we do
regarding the committee meeting?
No need to worry
Just tell Giri
He'll see to it
Okay then
Let me go
I've informed my mother
- I don't talk much to girls
- I know, Pooja has told me
'I found out everyone here
knew Giri except me'
You mean our Giri'ettan?
You too know him?
He is Kung fu master, right?
He is master at the academy
where my brothers learn Kung-fu
Which academy?
Where is it?
2 stuffed pancakes and
a milk shake, I'll take you
How can you go
for the tournament?
If you do they'll bash you
Go and practice well
- What is it?
- I came with her
I mean...I came
to see my brothers
Why do you send them here?
They are asleep full time
They don't have the energy
to do even a push-up
No wonder! It's all because of
the fast foods you buy for them
1st get them to reduce
Eat only porridge and pulses
Then they can learn Kung-fu
'Porridge and pulses'
For that people
at home must know to cook
Go...get going quickly
Come
Escape
Don't look back
He is in a bad mood and with
a stick in his hands too!
My dear most Tomycha
Instead of struggling in
an alien land, come to Kerala
Will you get this greenery,
breeze and sunshine there?
Just mint money in a desert
Will you get warmth with-
Go and shower
If you want warmth
you must come to Kerala
How long will you
keep postponing it?
Mom, how do you
make pulse-curry?
Forget it
I'll make it
Okay, I'll shower
and freshen up
Don't you dare touch it
Never
Cooking must never
be a ritual, my dear
Bear in mind
folks must eat it!
Whatever you do
you must have an aim
You must

"My dearest bird!"
'What is it?'
"Whom are you searching on paths winding
with your silver beam of moonlit eyes shining?"
"Girl, do your eyelids flutter
in shyness, they softly stutter?"
"Soft words of sweet nothings, dear
did the night bird whisper in your ear?"

tuned as a song of fresh surprise?"

Bye!
Get lost, girl!
"With letters of your life, name you etched
With your fingertips the truth you searched"
"Like a cloud of illusion here
girl, did someone appear"

you eavesdropped from behind doors closed"

she'd have joined the convent'
"Did someone caress your body, parakeet,

What are you doing?
Wash all this
Let me see who it is
'Giri, you?'
'Greetings, aunty
Were you busy?'
'Come...why so late?'
'They delayed it'
'I've told them I'll dump it over
their heads if the grapes were spoilt'
'Shall we find someone else?'
'Do you know any?'
'I'll find out
I do know a few others'
'That will be better'
'Good grapes must be
used in wine making'
'If it's someone you know
I can trust him all the more'
'I'll let you know'
'- How is Sumitra?
- She's fine'
- Shall I take leave?
- Sit, have some tea
No, I have class
at the academy
Okay
- Who was it?
- That was Giri
- Haven't you met him?
- No
He has come here so often
Giri is the most favorite student
of my husband, Kung fu Tomyachan
He used to come here
with him long ago
Very helpful
His mother Sumitra and
I were class mates
Poor thing
Ever since her husband died,
she has only Giri
And he...his mother
He could have
continued his studies
But he likes being a farmer
and this village life
I liked his decision
Doctors and engineers are
not the only people we need
Don't we need
someone for agriculture?
Sumitra used to write poetry
That was when she fell for
firebrand Madhavan and married him
Her family threw her out
And that put an end to
her writings and education
And then?
She does not write now
Giri is very upset about that
He says in her efforts to bring him up
her dreams took a back seat
I have seen him cry only once
Feeling sad for his mother
Poor boy!
He's a nice guy, eh?
If my daughter in Dubai, Helen
had been younger than Giri...
...I would have thought of
getting her married to him
I was just joking!
Our Kanjyani and Giri
were classmates
He knows him very well
What? Were they class-mates?
He never told me
What?
Nothing
Hi Sreelakshmi
Come
Look, how is my new business?
Internet is the future
The person who first
brought it here...David Kanjyani
Great
- Yuck! This is immoral traffic
- What traffic?
Immoral
Poor kids! This is the only
place they can sit together
They can use the internet
and enjoy privacy
And I make money
- Yuck!
- Why yuck?
Why are you here?
Want to browse?
I don't want to browse
- I came to ask you something?
- About what?
Were you and Giri classmates?
You are hell bent on
knowing about that rogue
I refuse to talk
Go away! Go!
You had better tell me or I'll tell
your people about this place
Goodness! I was just joking
Don't get angry
I'll tell you everything
I know him from
when I reached puberty
Puberty?
Did you think only girls
undergo that phenomeno-
We boys too face it
in life, my girl!
We 3 were thick friends
'Giri, that girl and me'
'He and that girl
were madly in love'
'What?
In love?'
Thick Love!
And...?
Like all girls, she married a well placed
guy from USA arranged by her family
From then onwards
he stopped talking to me
But what was your fault?
It was my father
who was at fault
Your father?
That girl was your cousin, my twin
who is now in America, Julie Kanjyani
Hey! That cheat!
Julie'chechi
Lord! I also ate 2 plates
of biriyani at her wedding
That day he removed
the pillion seat of his bike
Enough of chatting
Now go away
Let me tell you with my poor
experience of 5-6 affairs
A guy will hate all girls
if he has been ditched by 1
That too by a rich girl
And to make matters worse
one from your family
All that doesn't matter
I will tell him I like him
I have my doubts
if he'll even recognize you
How will you tell him?
I will tell him
My favorite saint
will show me a way
Won't you, Lord?
Road closed due to repairs
Do you know to repair cars?
Of course I don't
When it stops, we open the bonnet
Do we have to know how to repair?
Go out in a rickety old car
leaving the fine one at home
You can come after repairing it
I'll walk home
What happened, doctor?
Did the car let you down?
Giri...?
A small problem
I need to call a taxi
It's only a short drive
Come, I'll drop you
Thank you
Take off the keys
From the vehicle
Aren't you walking home?
Where are you coming from?
On our way back from
Francis's daughter's wedding
I heard about it
A record dowry
was given, right?
Sure! 200 gold sovereigns
If wealthy people like you keep
hiking dowry, where will it reach?
You ought to be ashamed
Poor families are
the ones affected
Our Gopal'ettan has 3 daughters
What will people like him do?
I hate people giving
as well as receiving dowry
As long as people like
you still exist...
...to help the poor and
conduct community weddings
Right?
Stop!
Stop, I say
Park this way
Now stop
What are you carrying?
Cow dung
Cow dung?
Take your documents
and show it there
You refuse to get out, eh?
Are your legs paralyzed?
Who is the sub inspector?
Is it George?
You dare address him by name?
What is it?
Some chap called Giri
He finds it tough to step out
Why do you force them?
Ask him to go
Can I give you
some cow dung?
No, I don't want
Do you know
that sub-inspector?
Yes, during a mild clash...
...when I was once part of
revolutionary activities
After that both of us
were put inside
He was in the ICU
I was in jail
SI assaulted by Thoma
Papa, how much dowry
will you give the man I marry?
What sort of question is that?
All our assets belong
to you, isn't it?
I will give him everything
Will that do?
You mustn't give
a single rupee
And if anyone insists,
get him married to mom!
Welcome to 'replies'
Switch off the TV
and go to bed
A letter from Suma of Athani
How will this work out?
Pooja is a wealthy girl
and Giri a poor farmer
Have you ever heard
a doctor marrying a farmer?
Fathima from Payyanad has replied
That girls likes him,
isn't that priority?
Sundaran from Tirur
explains explicitly
What is the use of
Pooja liking him?
Does she even know
where he lives?
If Pooja remains quiet, what if
someone else falls in love with him?
The song telecast last week
from the film 'Spadikam'...
...starring Mohan Lal and
Silk smitha was incomplete
Please telecast the full song
in your next episode requests-
- Who was it?
- Sugunan from Kundra
In such situations-
'I was a person
who slept like a log'
'But from that day onwards
Slumber-Goddess totally ignored me'
'I decided to find Giri's house'
Tommy'cha, how many times
must I tell you this?
Why do you struggle
in some alien land?
Come back here
Will you get Kerala's greenery
and warmth over there?
Come back here
Tommy'cha, 1 minute
- Where are you off to?
- Going out to see someone
It is about to rain
Don't go now
That's okay, I'll be
back before it rains
Listen to me
Don't go now
- I want to go
- Don't go now
Why shouldn't I go now?
Didn't I tell you this morning?
Go
- Tommy'cha-
- Tata
Where is Giri's house?
Beyond that field
Beyond, eh?
You!
- Why are you here?
- I came to see the rain
Are you a bull frog?
Go home, girl
Wait a minute
Go home
Come to see the rain, my foot!
Annie, who was it
who just went in?
- Your daughter
- Then it's okay
"Oh pristine bauhinia, sweet red lotus
Today, are you decked in loveliness?"
"Caresses softly...a song
Within the heart a tune hums along"
"Deep within stars shining bright
Did you gather them from the sky at night?"
"Did you utter words never spoken earlier?
Did you sing a song never heard before, dear?"
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born
Did you swing as dew drops this dawn?"
"Has no one till date gifted a kiss
to those honeyed petals...lips?"
"Parasol, woven with leaves, hides the face
of a moonbeam where shyness sways"
"White doves flutter here and there
Dreams born in their soul's center"
"Rain drops falling pitter patter, like music
to the ears from anklets which tinkle magic"
"Loving words of moonlight milky
melt anyone in its ways of coquetry"
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born
Did you swing as dew drops this dawn?"
"Has no one till date gifted a kiss
to those honeyed petals...lips?"
"Oh pristine bauhinia, sweet red lotus
Today, are you decked in loveliness?"
"Caresses softly...a song
Within the heart a tune hums along"
"Deep within stars shining bright
Did you gather them from the sky at night?"
"Did you utter words never spoken earlier?
Did you sing a song never heard before, dear?"
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born
Did you swing as dew drops this dawn?"
"Has no one till date gifted a kiss
to those honeyed petals...lips?"
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born"
I'll go see
Very intoxicating
Any other stuff
gives such a kick?
Love also is intoxicating
Right, my child?
I don't know
Pooja, don't think I'm advising
Giri is a great guy
But you...?
At this age, it's natural
to get attracted
But you may find out, too late
your feelings aren't the lasting kind
Immature feelings-
Forgetting the man she loved...
...and accepting a strange bald guy with
whom she shared tea for just 2 minutes
Even Julie'chachi is
much older than me
Is that what
you call maturity?
I don't know
But I know my parents
like Giri a lot
You also like him, don't you?
You told me once to
find the person I liked
And now?
Does Giri know this?
Have you told him?
No
But I will,
when I get a chance
Do you know what is
special this Sunday?
It's Oshana Sunday
That is for us Christians
They are Hindus and
don't celebrate Oshana
It is his birthday
He will go all by himself
to a special place
'It was a month after Hrithik Roshan
entered Indian Cinema'
Lord...ooops! Sorry
Lord Shiva
I can't figure out the deity
Whoever it is, this is
my 1st visit to a temple
Please don't think ill of me
Om Shanti
Isn't that how it is said?
Give him what he wants
And then give him to me
Why are you here?
Why do you
come to this...
...godforsaken temple
on your birthday?
This was a place of worship
for my forefathers
When it was converted as a forest reserve
thick bushes covered up the entire area
Dad used to come here secretly even when
he was member of the Communist party
He used to bring me here as a kid
It gives me pleasure to
be here on my birthday
Have you brought an umbrella?
Why?
Come
It always rains 1st on the hill
Did you know?
Look here-
Don't! Don't say anything
I can guess what
you are about to say
An emotion a young girl
feels towards an older man
You may want to blow it
out of proportion
One day you'll find it is not
worthy and that could be upsetting
Now is the time to study
To become a doctor
more proficient than your father
Or destined to reach
greater heights
Rid your mind
of other thoughts
The rain has stopped
I'll drop you back home
No need
I have my bike
"Isolation, solitude,"
"Loneliness prevails..."
"Isolation, solitude,"
"Loneliness
prevails..."
"I dreamt of her tressses
Lying on my hands"
"Alas, the dream got shattered
Had me down exhausted"
"I dreamt of her tressses
Lying on my hands"
"Alas, the dream got shattered
Had me down exhausted"
"Spent my past in solitude..."
'When he said all that
I was very upset'
'He called me a kid'
'He doesn't know the time
I spent to take a decision'
'I don't like him'
'Small kid, eh?!'
'When I turn 18,
I'll tell him again'
'That was when the medical
entrance exams came up'
'And entrance coaching guru
A terror called KC Thomas'
Entrance is war
You...!
Get out
I don't want 'entrance'
Let me go
I'll be a good girl
Let me go home
'5-6 months of torture ended
I wrote my exams splendidly'
'To recover from it, I slept like
a buffalo a whole day and night'
Things changed, after a month...

medical college and I turned 18 too'
'A phase when my whole
life will turn over'
'But one thing
remained unchanged'
'Giri, my first love'
'Before I left for Kozhikode
I wanted to meet him'
'And tell him that
wherever I went...'
'...or however renowned a doctor
I became, I'd always come back to him'
Hello, who is this?
The little doctor, eh?
Rachel told me you got through
your entrance exams
When are you leaving?
Classes begin
day after tomorrow
I must leave tomorrow
- Where is Giri?
- He went to the temple
'You've gone, without me
to get wet in the rain, eh?!'
When will he return?
He has gone to
a temple in China
'Lord! Is he turning
to communism again?'
Which temple in China?
It isn't a temple for prayers
It's a place for learning Kung fu
Kung fu temple?
- You mean Shaolin Temple?
- Yes! Exactly
He has been wanting
to go for long
He did get some scholarship
But did not want to
leave me alone here
Recently he went to conduct
a marriage for his friend
That turned out
into a world war!
It became a big issue
The bride's family
got mad at him
They threatened to kill him
When thugs started coming here
I told him to be away for some days
When will he come back?
I don't know, my dear
Anyway not in the near future
Even if he is far away
at least I will be at peace
Why did you come?
It was nothing
Just like that
Sit, my dear
Let me get you a drink
No, it's okay
I'll take leave
'So it ended like that'
'Mr Giri exited my life
without a word'
'I cried a lot that day'
'My efforts to learn to cook and
keep up with world events...all wasted'
- Give it to him
- Okay
'I sold my bike'
'I packed my bags and
I left for Kozhikode'
'Wine aunty was brewing
a new recipe of wine when I left'
We can sell it as junk
'Neethu's dad replaced
cassettes with CDs in his shop'
March, I say
Get him in
'David 'chetan' was arrested for
encouraging immoral activities'
- Kanjyani Brothers' Internet Caffi
- It's not caffi...cafe
Where is your accomplice Kanjyani?
I'm the only one doing this
The name was just for a punch
Punch, eh?
A few punches and
you'll know...get in
Looks like a shriveled shrimp
Wants a punch to his name!
Did you lock it up
and take the key?
'Only 1 person was sad
about my departure'
'Kozhikode
Sorry, Koyikode'
'Basheer saab's land
Samoodri's Koyikode'
'The place Vasco da Gama
first landed in India'
'With best beaches
and lake Mananchira...'
'...Kozhikode had
the best auto drivers'
Breeze here carries the scent
of 'halwa' and 'biriyani'
'And the ice-cream that
was exclusive to Kozhikode'
'4 years just flew past'
'I was interning
as a house surgeon'
'Which meant...'
'...in another year
I'd be a doctor'
Wake up, girl
'Neethu is still with me
MBA at university'
'I got a new friend too'
'Anna Maria'
'A-class Christian
from Kodanchery'
'We rented a house'
'My culinary skills learnt to
impress Giri came of good use now'
'My life had changed a lot
Except 1 aspect...Giri'
'Such a lot happened
in the last 4 years'
'Madhu Mohan stopped
making TV serials'
'Veerapan the bandit
was shot dead'
'Muraleedharan was
thrown out of Congress'
'What more do you want?
Even a tsunami ravaged our shores!'
'But only he didn't come'
Enough of reading
Come with me
What happened?
- Again he's not talking to me
- We'll set that right
'That was the time
Orkut became popular'
'Thinking he would be on Orkut
I created an account and searched'
'When I typed Giri
many other Giris popped out!'
'When they found
I'd visited their profile...'
'...they started sending me
scraps and messages'
'Finally I had to even
delete my account'
'Life was totally boring'
'I slogged like a machine
between classes and house'
'We were just thinking life was a waste
and sitting bored when it happened'
Let us discuss about different kinds
of cardiac arrests or heart attacks
For example
'We at first thought
he was showing us a demo'
'But it turned out he had actually
suffered a heart attack and conked off'
'After that was condolence,
wreaths, funeral and a holiday'
The film 'Classmates' was released
'And a fantastic new lecturer arrived'
"You are the moonlight of my heart
Musician who stands apart"
"Don't you want this perfume new
made from jasmine specially for you?"
"You are the moonlight of my heart
Musician who stands apart"
"You are the moonlight of my heart
Musician who stands apart"
"Don't you want this fragrance?
Beautiful singer par excellence"
'Dr Prasad Varkey
Taught us so well'
'Simple soul and
we all loved him'
'Especially the girls'
We can discuss this in detail
But before that, any doubts?
Sir, are you married?
Huh...hmmm...any other doubts?
Exams started after two months
Oh mother!
Take one
What is it?
Bone marrow
Aspiration needle
Sir, you want to
ask her something?
What do you know about...?
- Thank you, sir
- Good luck
Most of them
are quite studious
Good afternoon, sir
Take one
No, it's okay, sir
Take one, otherwise
how do we proceed?
No, sir
No, thank you
If you don't
VIVA can't continue
Take one
Take it
I asked you to pick
one of the instruments
Why did you
take the biscuit?!
I misunderstood, sorry
'From then on
we became great friends'
Going by her words
it can only be that
What?
Dr Prasad Varkey
She thinks he is
in love with you
Get lost, girl
He and I are good friends
Only good friends
become good lovers
His glances, conversation and smiles
Rewind the incidents
and observe in a close up
Throbbing with love, isn't he?
Lord! What a mess!
What's so messy?
Isn't it a good thing?
From America, a fantastic,
well qualified young doctor
Moreover a Christian
I would have blindly
nodded my head
Are you still thinking of
your Kung fu guy in China?
The rarest love-affair in the world!
Imagine! A girl goes to him
and he says she's still a kid
You were old enough to have
a kid if he had set his mind on it
Foolish fellow!
An umbrella made of leaves as gift
And that too, nothing
to show off about
He must have a wife and
4 kids in China by now
"A girl waiting only for you
For a long, long time"
'Come to bed, my dear man'
'I am working out ideas for
some new Kung fu steps'
'You always wanted a daughter
I can't make that happen by myself'
'Oh! Okay
I'll come'
What is it, my girl?!
Did you have a heart attack?
- No! A revelation
- What?
Spoilt my sleep as well!
'Next day was Diwali'
'I was walking with a heavy heart
thinking Giri was married, when...'
'...I saw Prasad Varkey
walking towards me'
'Was he coming to
declare his feelings?'
'St Antony! Please save me'
'I prayed and
just then I saw-'
Why are you here?
I study here
House surgeon
Why are you here?
I came to meet someone
Which is Dr Varma's room?
Upstairs
Okay, see you
Pooja
Who was that?
Doctor, I must
tell you something
He was the 1st person
in my life I liked immensely
I'm still in love with him
Then what's your problem?
He doesn't like me
Did he say so?
Not exactly
But when I professed my feelings
once, he told me I was still a kid
But that was then
Now you are grown
- It is of no use
- Why?
He was jilted
by a girl once
I think he carries her
in his heart even now
Look, I am not
able to eat this
Why don't we sit
somewhere and talk?
Lost love
Have you ever
smoked dope?
Dope?
I haven't either
But lost love has been
described in 3 stages
The 1st stage is like dope
Every puff warns you
That it's not good
Stop, since it's bad for health
Lost love is also like that
One wants to forget
But the kick it gives
won't allow you to
I should have got
the unshelled ones
The next stage is
like a house rented
We go looking in Orkut for her
and her latest lover's details
Just like a house owner
keeps tabs on his house
The last stage is
like the moustache
Moustache?
You can either grow it
Or shave it off
He does not have one now
Probably forgotten his old love
Pick up courage
Go and tell him
I am telling you
Just go
'I found out all men
are not the same'
'There were some who
treated you like a friend'
'I had not asked Giri
why he came that day'
'I went looking for Dr Varma'
'And was a regular
visitor to B-wing'
'That was when #106
got a new patient'
'A jolly good fellow'
Tharakan, my friend?!
Here comes
chatterbox Mariam
Why so thoughtful?
I was thinking of writing
a story based on diseases
What story can diseases have?
Diseases are like siblings
If one sulks,
others come to enquire
I just got over gas trouble
and his brother comes enquiring
Who?
Kidney stone
You'd think
it was a diamond
Jacob sir
Come
I've been discharged today
If I say we'll meet again,
hopefully not as patients!
So I'm not saying so
May everything be well with you
Okay
Let's leave
3 sons, but when illness struck him
only this daughter took care of him
His sons are very busy
'He was just like my papa
And we became friends quickly'
Hey!
You minx!
'It became my habit to
visit him every now and then'
Once when I visited 106,
I saw this sight in 107
Oh Lord!
Were you in this wing?
I didn't know at all
Rachel told me you were here
But he insisted
not to trouble anyone
Lord! Bilirubin is 10
Jaundice is quite severe
Why did you come so late?
I didn't realize it at all, dear
He had a friend here, Dr Varma
I wanted to be nearer home
People just walk away
to China and Ethiopia!
Don't worry, I'll come
and see you everyday
I think you can
go home in a week
I'll tell the duty doctor
I know you very well
Okay, see you
'When I saw Giri's mom in hospital
frankly, I was really very happy'
'Weakness for men
is usually their mom'
'That bed contained the googly
Giri could be clean bowled with'
Move aside
Move
Lets move
Chief Doctor says
just 4 days more
You can take rest
at home after that
Okay, little doctor
Have you eaten?
No, we don't get time
in between rounds
He was just going out
Take her with you and
bring me back something
Mother?
Thennal?
How come you are here?
I am in Providence college
as a guest lecturer
I am here
for past 1 year
This idiot didn't
tell me you were here
Enough of eating outside food
I cook at home
Let me bring you food
Come with me now
Are you leaving?
They'll be right back
You can go
after eating
No, I must complete my rounds
'And thus Pooja Mathew's googly
went for a sixer by Thennal Warrier'
'That was a Bom-Chika-Wawa moment'
I found out about her
Thennal K Warrier
She was my sister's classmate
Nice name
Thennal...breeze
Giri means mountain
She is a lecturer in Providence
And a young-gen budding writer
Writer...!
Look mountain...I mean Giri
That thing has come here also
Can't blame her
Anyone can wait
5 years for her
He is smarty
Not at all
He's a shorty!
Look at his silly smile
Look how indecent
with his shirt half open
Leave it alone, kid
What more do you want?
Mother is an old writer
and lover budding writer
He can sit and read volumes
written by both of them
Why are you feeling jealous?
They make quite a pair!
- Here! Go boil and eat it
- What a mean thing!
'What can I say?
He slipped out of my hands'
'I went quite mad
Everything I did was a blunder'
The wound was in this hand
'It was like a great boulder
was upon my heart'
'Every time I saw them together'
'I even thought of finishing her off
and be behind bars in Kannur jail'
'When I knew it was not working out
I took a break and went home'
'Lord! She's here also'
Book?
I too have a book!
Aren't you Pooja?
I'm Thennal
We met a couple of times
at the medical college
- Giri's friend
- You want tea?
- You want tea
- No
- Are you going home?
- Yes
Me too
My husband is coming
from Kuwait on leave
Are you married?
I was forced to marry
Giri himself made me
He came with Robin
to my house
It became a big issue
Finally Robin
and I came here
Giri was forced to
leave his village
If he had not
done this for us...!
Why are you laughing?
Nothing
I knew the 2 of you
were thick friends
2 tea please
- Fritters?
- No
"Blue sky spread with green
leaves of coconut trees"
This is a nursery rhyme, isn't it?
Yes dad
When people become older
they start behaving like kids
I've heard when girls grow up
parents' hearts burn with anxiety
Do you realize
how old you are?
Our Sunny was waiting
for you to return
I'm into a new venture
I am a marriage broker now
I want to begin my business
with a proposal for you
There's a nice groom
Shall I ask him to meet you?
Asking her to agree
to bride-viewing ritual?
Unthinkable!
She'll probably go
and 'see the boy'
Thank you
What is your name?
Giri
- Huh?
- Giri
What have you studied?
Masters in Malayalam
What?
I didn't hear you
His voice is too soft
Say it loudly
M.A in Malayalam
She may practice
archery and ride a bike
But a marriage proposal
will make all girls feel shy
Did you see her run
shy and demure?
Sunny said you ran away in shyness
I know my girl
is not like that
But why do you always
avoid the topic of marriage?
No reason, papa
I'm waiting
for something
If it does not happen
I'll let you know
Then I shall agree
to the boy you suggest
Is it some exam?
Yes, a tough exam
I wrote my MBBS too
What exam is this
I'm unaware of?
Syllabus has changed, old man
Times have changed
She's a little tigress
We'll have to try once more
'The next day I attended
an entire sermon of Holy Mass'
'That too full of songs'
'I heard through
Father's boring sermon...'
'...and was offering
prayers to forefathers'
Hey! Sukumara Kurup?
The famous missing convict!
When did you re-appear?
2 weeks back
Give it to me
I'll light it
I am not vanishing
because I want to
I tried many ventures
Nothing was successful
Now something new has come up
Okay, now tell me
I'm trying to arrange
a Kung fu tournament
Jeweler Paul has promised to
sponsor it with a good amount
He's interested
in such things
Go ahead, but
what's my role in this?
He has only 1 condition
Giri and his boys must take part
I know you and
Giri are close
Ask him to come with his boys
He has trained in China
Only if he enters the ring
there will be a storm in our village
Hey!
Hey!
Somehow...?
I won't ask him
You can ask him directly
I can't, he's still angry
with me even now
You think he's still thinking
about Julie's betrayal?
He must have
forgotten it by now
Go and ask him
Sure! So that he can
chop me to pieces
So it's not only about
Julie's cheating
There's something else
How will I explain it to you?
Imagine a situation where
Giri and I are in the Army
- Captain, help me
- Careful
Thank you, captain
Captain
Water
What about you?
You drink it, Lt. Kanjyani
You are so kind
Let's move, captain
- Step carefully
- Yes, captain
Enemies have buried mines
Country fellows!
Captain...?
Save me please...please
Lt. Kanjyani
Save me, Captain
Don't move
Stay still
Careful
Don't get panic
Take your foot off
Now for the boulder
Lt. Kanjyani
Get lost!
Did you do that?
Not like that
Much worse than that
Too shameful to be told
It's no use
blaming Giri then
Please?
Let me try talking to him
It's not because you requested or
to help this fellow I am agreeing
I want my boys to
utilize this chance
Go
Bring that sack
Me?
I will come
I'll be meeting you regarding
donations for the mass wedding scheme
Papa doctor and little doctor
had better contribute generously
Sure, I'll help in
any other way I can
I will come for
the next meeting too
Where are you off to?
Community wedding this time will
witness my presence there too
Good!
It is good to take part
in such social activities
I am proud of you
Please sign on this cheque
I'll write the amount later
Isn't this from my account?
- Yes
- I see
Thank you
Don't interfere too much, okay?
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born-"
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born-"
"Oh bauhinia, as red lotus you are born-"
'That meeting helped me
get closer to Giri'
'So when I asked him to come
with me to meet a special person...'
'...he agreed without
much persuasion'
Whose house is this?
Come, I'll tell you
Hello! Chatterbox
Welcome
Come
Had a good drive?
Giri, eh?
I know you
You don't have to know me
But if you read a lot, maybe
you'd have heard of me
Jacob Tharakan
Akshara publications
Yes, I have heard
I know Pooja for long
From her medical college days
Don't worry, not as classmates
When I get fed up of sleeping here
I go sleep there...for treatment
Akshara publications will
launch this book this week
You can have
the first copy
Have a look
'In memory of a red flower'
She gave me the manuscript
when I was in hospital
When I read it I felt
it was worth publishing
She has not influenced me
It is really worth it
Your mother is really
a writer to be encouraged
It was her wish you should
give the 1st copy to your mother
Sumitra will be happy, won't she?
Or will she put me
behind bars for stealing?
We'll see you
This girl is amazing
It isn't easy to work towards
realizing someone else's dream
The heart must be
full of love for that
You are lucky to get
a good friend like her
Good luck
Okay
Shall we leave?
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
"Moments when silence flowed
your eyes I searched, followed"
"Those lovegazes empowered
into my heart you showered"
"Moments when silence flowed
your eyes I searched, followed"
"Those lovegazes empowered
into my heart you showered"
"You are the song my eyes seek and savor
My fingers yearn to strum forever favor"
"You are the song filling my ear
As my lips sing them dear and clear"
"When you turn into a shadow
And your eyes like honey mellow"
'No range'
"You may be far away
But apple of my eye you stay"
"Moments when silence flowed
your eyes I searched, followed"
"Those lovegazes empowered
into my heart you showered"
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
Tommy'chaya, I am fed up of
telling you again and again
Greenery and warmth in Kerala
Come and take a look, dude
Okay then, get lost
Listen dear, Ravi had come
Something to do with that list
for the community wedding
That is tomorrow's work
Tomorrow is another day
Today's joys to
be enjoyed today
We have to make this
better than last time
25 couples this time
We must get the minister to
confirm the jewelry sponsorship
We'll do that
Did you check that list?
Who is Sreelakshmi's groom?
That has not been entered
I informed the secretary
Sreelakshmi will marry my son Giri
That is good
You have a generous heart
Please don't say such things
and convert this into charity
Sreelakshmi is a good girl and
I've known her since she was a kid
Giri also
She will be perfect for him
And you know Giri
He hates a wedding
with pomp and splendor
He will also like this
"Oh loved one"
"Oh loved one"
"My sky is cloudy"
"My love life is murky"
"Without my permission...
Without my knowledge..."
"Youve gone far away"
"Am suffering in solitude"
"I am drenching alone"
"Oh loved one"
"Oh loved one"
I'll speak to Sumithra
Don't be upset
No, aunty
Giri's mom was right
Giri also might
prefer it that way
Sreelakshmi is a sweet girl
I will never hurt her
Once I expressed my feelings
I can't go and be
shamefully rejected again
If we are to ever unite...
...he must come to me
and tell me he loves me
Frankly I am quite fed up
'I was sure that I'd get Giri
only through a miracle now'
'Lord's miracles appeared
to be my only options'
'I decided to latch
on to Him firmly'
Pooja?
Can you come out
for a minute?
Yes, Pooja
Forget all the old theories I fed you
Everything is fair in war and love
Don't consider
anything else
We'll cross the bridge
when we come to it
Take one
Now, take one
- What happened?
- Listen!
Shall we ask
Giri to help us?
How foolish can you be?!
That will not work out
Nothing doing!
You don't have to do anything
I'll talk to him, just stand by me
This is the only way out
Trust me
Rahim Rawther's daughter?
So many Christian girls around and
you chose Rahim Rawther's daughter?
To fall in love and elope?
Bro, you must help me
just this one more time
I conducted the tournament and
saved money to marry Naseema
Now her marriage will take
place at the community wedding
We have no option
but to elope now
You must help us
Please
Please
Help us
No, this will
not work out
Don't ever expect me
to help you in this
Talk to him
We thought you'd help
2 people in love
You put your own life at stake once
to get 2 of your friends married
This is not as bad as that
and I thought you'd help
Sorry for asking
Pooja
Naseema was Pooja's classmate
She can easily bring her out of her house
But from there
Giri you must help me
Where the heck were you?
How long to wait!
Come, get in
Let's go
Just stop there
Here
Come
Get down
Bro, thanks a lot
I'll never forget this favor
If fate allows
we'll meet again
All I have to say
is in this letter
I take leave
Okay
'Giri, you rogue,
vagabond, shameless fellow!'
'I used to hang around
in bus stops to meet her'
'You used to chase me away
saying I was a flirt'
'When I set up the internet cafe
just to meet her...'
'...you got the police to
arrest me for immoral activity'
'I struggled, made some money
and decided to marry her'
'Under the pretext of
community marriages...'
'...you decided to marry her'
'Do you think
you are a do-gooder?'
'Like emperor Ashoka?'
'I won't allow it'
'I won't give up
my girl for you'
Sreelakshmi
Get lost, man
Kanjyani?!
You vagabond!
Start the vehicle quickly
Get lost, dude!
'P.S'
'Don't come after us please'
'Allow us to live'
'That was the last time
Kanjyani chetan disappeared'
'But from then on, he who had
cheated and harassed people...'
'...occupied the place
of a saint in our lives'
'I was sure Giri would
now tell me he loved me'
'I was sure, the sun
would rise that midnight'
Come, I'll drop you home
Why so late just to
get your exam results?
What happened?
Didn't you get through?
It's okay, dear
Don't worry
Why don't we proceed with
that proposal Sunny brought?
Let's ask Sunny to come
'In the end, just like Julie chechi
I felt I was destined to marry some idiot'
'The next day was
an Oshana Sunday'
Papa, please hold this
Pooja, don't forget
what I told you
Hear him out fully
and then decide
Your mom and dad
have never hurt you
Think of them too
before you decide
I am with you
Go, my dear
'Same old place'
'Only the rainfall is missing'
You know Pooja
I'm an ordinary person
A farmer
'He has started'
Now he'll say...
...Pooja you belong
to an affluent family
Pooja, you belong
to an affluent family
You have great heights to reach
You have great heights to reach
We belong to different worlds
We belong to different worlds
in many aspects
But...
...they don't matter to me
What?
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
"Into my heart whispering
In these moments of love, inspiring"
"My sacred symbol of love, gilded splendor
To me you belong, my dear wonder"
"You fill me up in hues seven
like a rainbow in heaven"
"Like sweetness shower
you rain upon me forever"
"I become your shadow sublime
With eyes of sweet nectarine"
"You may be far away from me
But apple of my eye you'll always be"
"I am a man in love"
"Wandering"
"Unknown"
"A madman"
"I am a man in love"
"Wandering"
"Unknown"
"Oh God! What's happened to me?
Lord! I have lost my heart indeed"
Allowing her to practice archery,
ride a bike and what not!
And now pillion riding on a bike
hugging a Hindu boy for all to see
Dude, there must be
a limit to pampering
Otherwise this is what you get
Has the cat delivered
kittens in your mouth?
Is this why you asked me to come
to Kerala's greenery and warmth?
I am leaving
You can sit all alone
and enjoy this greenery
Warmth, my foot!
Don't worry
Worry?
I am not at all worried
I knew long back she wouldn't
agree to an arranged marriage
She is Pooja, my daughter
Destined for a love marriage
And Giri
He will never elope
He is very decent
Just watch, they will be here soon
What do you say now?
Doctor, I want
to speak to you
You want to marry
my daughter, right?
Go ahead
Don't bungle it
with explanations
How is that possible?
He is a Hindu
Did Jesus bear the cross
only for Christians?!
Did he not?
Which century are you still living in?
Come in, both of you
Come
'Giri who had rejected me
on one Oshana Sunday...'
'...was given a proper task
by the Lord 6 Oshanas later'
'HE got me married to him'
'Thus everything
ended beautifully'
'Papa was on the verge
of discovering a new drug'
'But just then mother...!'
Sorry!
'Donna married a guy who ate
8 stuffed dosas at one go'
'Neethu decided on 1 guy finally
She married Yardley!'
