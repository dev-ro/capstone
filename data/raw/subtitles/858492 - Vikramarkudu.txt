be in a fix.- Fine.- I'II kick you.
C'mon heIp me.
TCTahalapTthy
It's your photo. When did you grew
such a big moustache?
It's herfather's photo & not mine.
He Iooks Iike me.
First we must find him and
hand over his daughterto him.
Where wiII you search him?
He wiII be somewhere orthe other.
I'm a big cheat.
Looks Iike he is worse than me.
Since he has Ieft his daughter behind,
he is not an ordinary scoundreI.
Together we are 50 men.
And we have come to kiII you
and your daughter.
You don't even have to touch my daughter.
I'II kiII you the moment
you think of doing that.
UncIe..-Yes.
Somehow we must find him
and get rid of that IittIe deviI.
Ask him.- Okay.
Have you seen him?
Trying to tease me.
He is right behind you.
And you are asking me?
Making fun of me!
Do you think you both are big shots.
Get Iost.
Why is he getting so angry?
Why are they running?
I don't know too.
Let's go & find him.
Find him.
Hey Vikram Rathore.
Hiding Iike girI! Come out.
Come out I say.
You coward!
You ran away!
Come out if you are a reaI man.
Come out.
Boss, he is not here.
Where can he go?
He wiII die for sure. Come.
Mr. Vikram, I toId you to take
compIete bed rest.
But you never Iisten to me.
And you keep wandering around.
You don't understand the situation.
In the accident, your brain got damaged.
A major bIood vesseI got
damaged and has swoIIen.
No one knows when it wiII burst.
To be precise, your brain is
Iike an active voIcano.
Don't go out of the hospitaI.
If you don't Iisten to me,
it is Iike pIaying with death.
Eat.
Not feeIing hungry?
Then eat.
You used to feed everyday, dad.
Another one!
My hand got cut & is paining. Eat.
She has turned into a Ieech.
I'm getting irritated.
She irritates me even when I dine.
When wiII I get rid of her!
TCTahalapTthy
Daddy...-What now?
Since your hand is cut...
I'm not hungry. You eat.
Get Iost.
I said I'm not hungry, right. You eat.
Shit!
What is she doing?
SIeeping.
She didn't eat.
I must curse yourfatherfirst.
He briIIiantIy forced you on me.
Even if you eat or not,
the mistake is yourfather's.
Oh my god! I feII down.
I'm in no way reIated to you.
Don't ask me to feed you. Got it?
I'm taIking. Don't disturb me.
SiIence.
And now...
I'II break you into pieces.
Nobody Iistens to me untiI I beat them.
She won't aIIow me to sIeep peacefuIIy.
Why are you crying?
I can't pIay my mom's song, daddy.
It is broken.
Thank you daddy.
May the sky, earth, water and
the breeze be with you.
Just one more dear.
- No thanks, daddy.
PIease dear. Just one more.
Okay, onIy one.
-Yes, just one. Come.
Daddy, someone has come foryou.
You said you cheat peopIe.
But stiII I feII in Iove with you.
You said you hate kids.
I stiII agreed.
You conceaIed that you've a chiId.
ActuaIIy...
So, your Iove is not true.
Be here. I'II be back now.
I'm not married and
she is not my daughter.
When she is caIIing you daddy,
how can we trust you?
Herfather Iooks Iike me.
That's why she is getting confused.
My daughter said that you've
stopped cheating peopIe.
But you've not quit your profession.
Sir, I'm teIIing you the truth.
AtIeast you beIieve me, Neeru.
She is in no way reIated to me.
I swear on you.
So, you are in no way reIated to her.
-Yes sir.
Then, there is a bus going to Devgarh.
Come & join us. ...AIone.
Daddy, IoIIipop.
TCTahalapTthy
Take her & go.
Run or eIse they wiII kiII her. Go.
Who are you?
Why are you after me?
Sathibabu...run.
Once more pIease.
Run brother...run.- Leave me.
Run brother. - Leave me.
Don't get scared. You're safe.
Neha...dear Neha.
Come.
Stop.
He said that he's not afraid of death.
Now I see the fear of death in his face.
It's not easy to face death.
You coward!
If you reaIIy have the guts,
you wouIdn't have run this far.
Am I any hired goon to fear death?
I don't fear death.
Instead death fears me.
Death hasn't got the guts to face me.
It's been after me for
the past 6 months.
To take me, death needs another
10 more bodies.
I swear on my moustache,
I swear on my daughter,
if anyone of you survive,
or if I die a minute earIierthan you,
shave my moustache and
then bury me, you scoundreIs!
Come.
Inspector, is there anyone eIse?
- No sir.
Doctor, how is my daughter?
- She is out of danger.
She'II gain conscious in a whiIe.
- Doctor...
TCTahalapTthy
Even though you don't ask us,
we are bound to answerto the
questions that you've in your mind.
Who is he? Who are we?
Why we made you a pawn & troubIed you?
We need to give an expIanation
to aII these questions.
For someone to be remembered
for 100 years,
he doesn't have to Iive 100 years.
A day is enough.
His victories wiII make
him Iive for 100 years.
He Iives in the peopIe's hearts
of ChambaI Iike a Iightning,
a power,
he is Vikram Singh Rathore, IPS.
AdditionaI Superintendent of poIice.
Six months back, peopIe in ChambaI
were mereIy sIaves.
And the poIice weartheir uniform
onIy to covertheir bodies.
Even I was C.I. for a division.
Where are you going?
- Bavuji...
To meet Bavuji.
PoIice can't go inside.
Don't you know the ruIes.
May aII diseases get cured!
Take good care of that bIack cow.
It's getting weaker everyday.
- Greetings sir.
Ram Ram Bavuji. -Yes teII me.
I'm the C.I. of this division.
My name is Mahanti.
What's your probIem? TeII me.
My wife is missing from yesterday.
ReaIIy...?
What's her name?- PramiIa.
Age?- 30 sir.
Very dangerous age.
She must be very young.
Father, mummy is overthere. - Mother...
Do you know where she went?- No sir.
Or do you suspect anyone?
No sir.
Okay. I'II find & send her home.
She'II be home in...2 days.
My chiIdren didn't eat for
the past 2 days.
Didn't I say I'II find & send her home.
Take good care of your chiIdren. Got it?
Go.
I said go.
Brother-in-Iaw...- Boss.
My kingdom is Kingdom of Rama.
No murders, no rapes, no rowdyism.
We'II be forced to commit a murder
onIy when anyone rebeIs against us.
OnIy when a woman refuses to come,
we'II be forced to moIest her.
OnIy when someone refuses to give bride,
we'II be forced to do rowdyism.
No such things happen here.
That's why the viIIage is very peacefuI.
Wow! Those are goIden words.
You are Lord Ram & I'm your sIave.
I'II buiId a tempIe atIeast
by borrowing money.
Wow! SIeeper coach.
Look at the one coming.
AC bogie.
Find whether she is free.
Aunty, are you free or booked?
Give them what they ask for.
Aren't you angry on us giving money?
Why wouId he?
If he doesn't give, he'II Iose another Ieg.
Who wiII free us from these demons?
TCTahalapTthy
Sir, want a taxi?
Where do you want to go?
- DaIim Chowk.
Rs. 200. - It's very near by.
The distance does not matter.
Whatever Bavuji gang says is finaI.
No thanks.
Once you've inquired,
you must pay the money,
no matteryou take the taxi or not.
Take the money out.
Don't quarreI with them.
Give them what they ask for.
You've come with your daughter.
Where is her mother?
Hasn't she come?
Or has she eIoped with someone?
TeII us what happened?
Why someone eIse? Aren't we here?
Listen to your mummy's song.
I'II be back soon.
Coming back?
Stay where you are.
You are finished today.
Don't move. Steady.
Don't move I say.
I see 20 fingers now.
I see nothing.
Boss, it is urgent.
I'II be back right away.
Oh my god!
Get up.
Your name?
Yours?
TeII me your name?
Your name?
Wearyour shirts.
Take out the money.
Is your own money in this?- No.
Brother, you beat them weII.
Who are you?
Return their money.
- Okay brother.
Put on buttons... shut your mouth.
Never again shouId I see you.
Daddy...
Good morning sir.
Razia, S.I. PateI Nagar.
Arranging your house aII aIone?
You couId've caIIed us for heIp.
- I'm used to it.
Sorry sir. A smaII misunderstanding.
They said the train was Iate.
Or eIse I wouId've come
to the raiIway station.
It's okay. PIease sit.
Try to adjust.
Sir, shaII I prepare miIk foryour chiId?
- I'II do it.
You've brought your daughter aIone.
Hasn't your wife come?
So, what eIse?
How is the viIIage?
Father, it's getting Iate to schooI.
I couIdn't pIat sister's hair.
Come father.
Why did you come here?
Your wife...?
I know how difficuIt it is
to bring up chiIdren.
We have to take care of everything. Go.
My mother is not dead.
She is stiII aIive.
Do you suspect anyone?
Who are you?
Leave me.
Oh my god!
Who are you?
One phone caII wiII get you transferred
to the pIace you came from.
When a poIice gets transferred,
he wiII stiII go to a poIice station.
And not to a post office.
Even before the transfer order gets ready,
both you & your son wiII die.
CIose aII the gates.
Sit in the car.
Open the gate.
He wiII break the gate.
I'm here, boss.
If I can't heIp you,
it's a waste to be Home Minister.
PIease forgive me.
I've informed the DGP to come here.
PIease be patient.
Now if you caII TitIa,
the viIIage wiII burn.
The very thought of his arrivaI
creates rippIes in my heart.
PIease Iisten to me.
It's my responsibiIity to
bring back your son.
Here he comes!
Greetings sir.
- Enough of your greetings.
When there is so much happening here,
were you sitting at home pIaying
with your baton?
It's been years since we used batons.
When I took charge, you toId me to overIook
whatever happens in this viIIage
That's why I kept quiet. - Shut up.
ViIIage is different from Bavuji.
Bavuji is the king of this viIIage.
How couId you arrest his son?
Who is he? Where is he?
Say something.
He is the newIy appointed ASP.
Vikram Rathore. - Shut up.
Why did you bring him here?
Say something. - I didn't.
He's here on a reguIartransfer.- Shut up.
Was he transferred without
your knowIedge.
So, were you sIeeping in your office?
What shouId we do now?
Say something.
I'II inquire about him. - Shut up.
I'm feeIing restIess in my constituency.
Stupids become officers.
I don't know what you're going to do.
By afternoon, Bavuji's son must be here.
And that officer must faII at Bavuji's feet.
Say something. - Sure I'II wiII.
I'II take Ieave.
Enough of your saIutations.
Bring him back fast.
They're eating my brain.
Once they wearthis uniform,
they wouId be raring to kiII every criminaI.
Home Minister was shouting at me.
Once bitten twice shy.
Where is the fiIe?
TCTahalapTthy
He has an impressive track record.
Where is he?
Do you want me to caII him?
We wiII meet him.
In your4 years of service,
you were promoted 4 times,
transferred 10 times,
and made no compromises.
Yourtrack record is good.
Winning MedaIs & having good
track record isn't enough.
When you are in duty,
you must be sincere & fearfuI.
And I think you are not used to it.
Do you know how fear Iooks Iike?
When you are in deep sIeep at night,
someone wiII knock the door.
When you open the door,
you wiII find the security missing.
Even your revoIver wiII go missing.
You'II onIy hearthe rowdies giggIing.
Do you know how scary it wiII be?
Your daughter who comes by 4 pm
from schooI, wouIdn't have come.
When you inquire in the schooI,
the watchman wiII say she has Ieft.
6 O'cIock... 7 O'cIock...8 O'cIock...
You'II never know about
your daughter's whereabouts.
You'II receive a phone caII at 10.
Do you know how scary it wouId be
to know what the phone caII is about.
Rathore, fear is very precious.
Never underestimate it.
He who has no fear cannot survive.
Why do you feeI that I've no fear?
Not once a day,
I fear every moment of my Iife.
When Ijoined duty 4 years ago,
I swore to sacrifice my Iife to do my duty.
As you said, someone knocking my door
and the phone beII ringing
may or may not happen.
But I wiII die someday orthe other.
On that day,
the moment I meet death face to face,
I fear every second that I may faiI
to fuIfiII my promise.
A criminaI's fear can be found
in every nerve of his.
And my fear Iies in the
honour of my uniform.
My duty is over.
I promised my wife that I wiII
take good care of my daughter.
I've onIy one wish.
When I meet death face to face,
Iet there be no fear in my eyes.
I shouId wear a smiIe on my face
with my hand twisting my whiskers.
Daddy...
Daddy, did mom go away without teIIing us?
-Yes.
WiII you aIso go away?
- No dear.
If you go, take me aIong with you.
I can't Iive aIone.
Munna the accused
has misbehaved due to unstabIe mind.
Since it has been proved
that it was not intentionaI.
the court pronounces him innocent
and sets him free.
ForfiIing a case without
proper evidence,
the court warns the poIice dept. and
orders poIice to take him home safeIy.
Daddy, judge made a fooI out of him.
He got scared & brought me in jeep.
You've arrested Bavuji's son.
You wiII have to bearthe
insuIt 10 times more.
To ceIebrate my son's reIease,
I'm throwing a party tonight.
You must come. And you wiII.
Because your Home Minister
is coming too.
You wiII come to give him security.
I'II show you then how my son
wiII insuIt you.
Get Iost.
Daddy, I want ChameIi fortonight's party.
Heaps of saris Iying unused...
Never gave myseIf in to anyone...
I never aIIow anyone to touch me...
What a deviI of woman I am!
WiII you come once?
WiII you give it to me?
WiII you come at dawn?
WiII you Iight fire of passion and go?
WiII you come after me and
take me away with you?
TCTahalapTthy
My friend has come from Bombay...
Greet him...
Eat, drink and
have fun at night...
Take rest in daytime...
WiII you bite my chubby cheeks?
WiII you take on my hot passionate youth?
WiII you touch enticing IittIe
wrinkIe on my waist?
WiII you knock the squeaking door?
WiII you come down and tie ankIets?
WiII you come forward to
drown me in kisses?
WiII you sting Iike scorpion
on my sensitive pIaces?
TCTahalapTthy
WiII you spiII water on raging fire?
WiII you miIk the goIden bowI?
WiII you pIay with my youth?
WiII you give a joIt to wake
it from sIumber?
WiII you strip sari without informing bIouse?
WiII you strip bIouse without informing sari?
WiII you make me mother without
making me squeaI?
TCTahalapTthy
Enough of your shaking Iegs,
Minister is coming, cIear out.
WiII you come?- Got cash?
Not free?- BIoody dirty face!
WeIcome Home Minister!
I want to pIay a game with them.
What game?
I'II chase one of them, if I catch him,
...he must strip.
Mad boy! He's very enthusiastic
to pIay...Iet him pIay.
ASP! Why are you getting so angry?
PoIice are friends of peopIe.
You must pIay and be friendIy with them.
OnIy then they wiII have faith on us.
Keep it inside...keep it.
Start your game son.
TCTahalapTthy
Strip...strip your uniform...
Come on strip.
Losing poIiceman's beIt,
I'II use it for our buffaIo.
Remove your pant...
Remove...remove...
Now...
...the PoIiceman with moustache!
He's running way...I'II catch him...catch him.
My son!
My son!
FiIe an FIR as a mad man
jumped down to his death.
Take Home Minister's signature as witness.
If it's not enough take his
father's signature too.
Not onIy a PoIiceman,
even his uniform wiII be on duty.
TCTahalapTthy
May god bIess you with
a Iong and happy Iife!
I'm Prakash Mehra,
I'm a journaIist.
This is demoness HoIika,
HoIi is ceIebrated to mark
God kiIIing this HoIika.
We are not ceIebrating today for it,
but forthe death of Munna.
Sir, Iook at the happiness
in these peopIe's faces.
If you get rid of othertwo peopIe,
it's festivaI everyday here.
This must become theirfuneraI pyre.
Yes sir.
I suspect TitIa's men are
in this crowd, aIert aII our men.
Coward backstabs.
Man fights face to face.
When I face death,
fear shouIdn't be seen in my eyes,
I must be smiIing and my hand shouId
be smooching my moustache.
TCTahalapTthy
Vikram Rathore...great poIice officer.
You worshipped him Iike god for
his uniform, his power and manIiness.
Look at your God's fate.
He died with just one buIIet, bIoody.
Is he the man to change your Iives?
Hear me, my brother Bavuji
writes the fate of this pIace,
Even if God himseIf descends here
can't aIter one Iine aIso.
He'II meet the same fate.
Because your God drinks nectar,
but I drink bIood.
BIoody, he's dead.
Dead Rajput shouIdn't
Ieave this worId aIone.
That's why I kiIIed you, dog!
Before my son is reduced to ashes.
Show his grave before any new
poIice officertakes charge here.
Sir, he's stiII aIive.
Every body be caIm,
pIease keep this as secret...
He's a God to us aIso, we swear on
our chiIdren to keep the secret.
After knowing he's aIive,
to make Bavuji beIieve it,
we buried an empty coffin.
We managed to save his Iife temporariIy
with aII our medicaI knowIedge.
We shifted him to Hyderabad
for his safety.
On consuIting doctors here,
they say his survivaI is very bIeak
and may die any moment.
His daughter's probIem was more painfuI
than his impending death.
She'II not eat untiI he feeds,
and never sIeeps without him.
We saw you in those circumstances.
We inquired about you thoroughIy.
We know you hate chiIdren.
We wanted herto be with you
pIaying aII sorts of drama.
You know what had
happened afterthat.
It was our mistake to troubIe you
without any connection to this.
We didn't have any other way
to find a fatherto her.
How are we to say sorry to you?
- No need.
We pray to God for his Iife.
If you've anything to teII him, you can.
Brother.
TeII me sir...teII me sir.
Don't worry about your daughter.
She's my daughter.
Father.
What happened father?
Nothing dear, uncIe is unabIe to sIeep.
So we are here to...
This song wiII put him to sIeep, father.
I fear of not keeping up my promise.
Not onIy poIiceman,
even his uniform does the duty.
Devgarh
Beat those bastards. TeII me.
TeII me, where is he?
LoyaIty to the master.
So arrogant?
Where have you hidden him?
They say he's dead, why are you
asking them, where is he?
If they reveaI the pIace, you'II open
the grave to see his body.
His body too wiII spring up to
do duty on seeing you.
Why are you itching for it?
Brother-in-Iaw! - Shut you, crook.
He's unIike us, he stands by his word.
If he's aIive, he'II come uninvited.
If he comes, he'II not go without
compIeting his mission.
I too wish the same, he must
come to die in my hands.
Don't say he must come,
God's may bIess so be it.
If they, you are finished.
You Iook very happy,
pay fine of Rs.50 for whistIing.
I'm Duvva AbbuIu.- I asked money.
Pay man. - If I say no.
Your body wiII be found on tracks.
Is the pIatform fuII?
Hey, he's cracking jokes man.
Thrash him up.-WiII I keep quiet?
I'm Vikram Rathore's assistant.
Vikram Rathore? He's dead.
That's why we're back into the business.
Is it? Look there!
Brother has come back.
May god bIess you a Iong Iife.
Brother. -Are you fine kid?
I beg you sir, start from here sir.
If you start from there,
I can't bearthe tension.
Don't formuIate new ruIes,
you start from here sir.
Not now boys, I've much work
to do in the viIIage.
I'II take a day off and
spend it on you.
Okay sir, we'II stay here
tiII you come.
Dead...dead...how many
times wiII he die?
Do you need it now?
He may hearyour shouts
and come back aIive.
Is it your In-Iaw's pIace
to put right Ieg first?
Cunning viIIain's house,
they must perish with my arrivaI.
Put forward your Ieft Ieg.
TCTahalapTthy
What is he? - God bIessed.
Hey Bavuji! It seems you yearned to see me.
You escaped Iike a coward
pIaying death drama.
One hit and you needed
6 months to recover. - I died?
You were mourning your son's death,
I gave IittIe time to recoverfrom it.
Foundation for peace was Iaid
with your son's death,
If I kiII you and your brother,
the viIIage's fate wiII change for good.
You can't harm me in any way.
I'm the onIy rowdy to this viIIage.
You're right, I'm aIso saying the same.
There must be onIy one,
it must be the poIiceman.
Forget about aII this crap taIk, get as
many rowdies as possibIe for heIp,
caII press media aIso.
Tomorrow morning by 9 am,
I'II distribute aII the stock
you're hoarding to pubIic.
In fuII pubIic gIare.
Do whateveryou can.
Your history is over.
Your Iife hereafter...
What is he teIIing this new word?
Jintha means base.
Thatha means baton.
Chithak means chutney.
It means I'II beat with baton to
make chutney of your base.
Sathibabu's words are Iies.
His Iove is aIso faIse.
If the girI wasn't his daughter,
he wouId've come here by now.
Listen to me accept the marriage
proposaI yourfather has brought.
If you don't he's refusing
to come home.
Listen to me and agree.
I don't Iike mother.
I feeI I made a mistake
by refusing Sathibabu.
You're not Sathibabu,
but Vikram Rathore.
We'II be in troubIe if anyone knows
about impersonisation.
HandIe it cIeverIy.
WiII you Ieave me if my parents
accuse you of Iying?
Do you know how eagerIy
I was waiting foryou?
Who are you?
Asking me who am I, Sathibabu?
Sathibabu?
ASP?
Sathibabu is my repIica and my daughter
stayed with him for a week,
he said his girI friend Ieft
him mistaking him?
You Iost a good man.
Don't act smart with me.
FaIIing in Iove with you,
I've become very shrewd.
I'II give you a jerk.
ActuaIIy many girIs got
confused seeing me...
What's this?
What's the exposing?
Aren't you ashamed?
WiII you show me your waist?
I'II arrest you.
CIose it.
Aren't you reaIIy not Sathibabu?
StiII any doubt afterthis incident?
Where is Sathibabu?- HimaIayas.
Why?
Any man disiIIusioned with
woman goes there onIy.
Because he needs a wet cIoth
to sIeep at night.
Won't he come back?
-Why wiII he not?
Today is fuII moon day,
take head bath at midnight,
wear a white sari beIow your naveI
and go to the terrace.
Where are HimaIayas? - North.
CaII him with Iove, AthiIi!
He'II appear before you.
It seems he'II come if I caII him
from terrace at midnight?
PoIiceman is trying to fooI me.
If it turns true,
may be I'II miss him.
Let me try it.
beIow the naveI!
UncIe.
Didn't get sIeep?
If you sIeep, I'II aIso get sIeep, uncIe.
WiII you have miIk?
WiII you?
Are you watching over me?
If I add IittIe IocaI stuff to it,
entire dept. wiII come to wake you up.
Take it...have it.
Hey AbbuIu! How cIeveryou are!
Let your inteIIigence go to heII!
I never expected to
get rid of her so easiIy.
What?
- Come.
Come.
-Where?
Inside. Into the Iock up.
Come.
What's this?
The stuff has compIeteIy taken over her.
You handcuff peopIe before
putting them in Iock up, right?
Stay put here.
Escape!
Thank God! I escaped from her.
She's not foIIowing me, is she?
Won't I steaI her home before she comes?
Before she bats her eye once!
Goddess of WeaIth must appear before me.
Say it with Iove
It seems you went away to
HimaIayas getting angry on me.
Yes, if you'd deIayed a IittIe
I wouId've drank hoIy water.
Our Iove wouId vanish.
Do you know how anxious I was foryou?
Thief! I got you!
Who are you? Get out!
Who are you? Thief hid it.
What's aII this?
- Take your hands off, what's there?
Baton! Thief hid it.
Come, I must put you in
Iock up and thrash you.
CeII wiII disintegrate,
take your Iegs off.
He's my thief, my wiII and wish.
Sathibabu, teII herto

You're breaking my waist!
A Ieg from there and a Ieg
from here, AthiIi in between.
PIay...have a baII!
TCTahalapTthy
If you see me...
If I come to your house...
If I get caught with
you in dark...
AthiIi Sathibabu
is smooth operator...
Look at me...
TaIk to me...
Let me touch you...
Take on you...
When Iovers take a decision...
When they both are interested,
who can stop them?
TCTahalapTthy
God came...Lord came...
Great warrior came gaIIoping on horse...
Lord of Iords came...
Waking up...
Raking up...
Dusting up...
Pinching...
If both are interested, who can stop them?
TCTahalapTthy
We brought the girI to him.
You made an entry then.
We were confused to teII you the truth or not.
He Ieft you for us and the IittIe girI,
certainIy not to cheat you.
No probIem.
Hereafter she's my responsibiIity.
It's going to ring 9, Vikram Rathore
vowed to Ioot your godowns.
What are you pIaning to do?
Either he'II wet his pants
or hang himseIf to death,
why are you bothered about it?
Did I give good repartee?
No?
See what I'm going to do
and show it to peopIe aIso.
It's 9! Come on man.
It's 9.30 now, why hasn't he come yet?
WiII he wait tiII inauspicious
time eIapses?
It's 11.30 now.
Where is the poIiceman?
He may be sitting in Iock up fearing
the power of my men.
He won't sit quiet, very cIever man.
Shut up!
Hey Where are your godowns man?
I'm searching every street
trying to find address.
By the way, I saw a board
Bavuji Iiquorfactory.
I got bored and bIasted it.
LittIe incidents Iike this happen,

Hey BIoody idiot! If you've guts stay there.
I'm coming there.
Is it? Okay, I'II wait here.
Start the vehicIes.
Sir...sir...you are going away.
What are you going to do now?
Why are you shocked?
He Iifts his dhoti to tie up

That's aII!
TCTahalapTthy
Didn't he come?
He Ieft just now getting a phone caII.
Went away?
BIoody bastard!
I chaIIenged him openIy to come
with his entire gang,
that I wiII beat him stripping
him in pubIic.
He ran away.
He's a viIIain and you are afraid of him.
TiII now he tortured you aII,
so I'm distributing his weaIth.
Loot it.
Is it on air Iive?
Just a minute.
See, everyone in the viIIage
watch this program.
See how Bavuji ran away from battIefieId

What's this bIocking the road?
Why did you ran away

Okay, I'II give you another chance.
I'II wait in the main centre
to Iynch you with pubIic fury,
if you've guts, if you drink cow's urine,

WhiIing away time with this.
You must take out reaI things
to fight not vehicIes.
Coming.

gathered a good crowd.
Let the reaI man in this crowd
dare to fight me. Come out!
If one of you steps forward today,
it wiII be end of Bavuji's Iife.
Come out...come out...how can they?
BIood isn't running in their veins,
it's my urine.
Not a man is getting angry
hearing his derogatory words.
Don't get scared of men behind him.
Your exhortations are in vain,
nobody wiII dare to go against me.
At a snap of my finger women wiII Ieave
their husbands to sIeep with me,
want to see it?
Hey you! Come here.
I may not be as good as my son,
but I can at Ieast do it once in a month.
Sit here.

If I dared Iike this earIier,
I wouId've kiIIed both son & father,
and sIept with your bodies, bastard.

He sIapped his thigh Iike Duryodhana.
He's done with it.
Stop it.
Get up you shorty.
A Iady kicked you in pubIic,
are you a rowdy?
Whatever Ieft wiII be squeezed
out by poIice, come.
Beat them, thrash them.
They must wet their dhotis
on seeing poIice uniform.
Beat them.
Oh No! Stop...stop...stop it.
ASP, what is this?
So many batons?
Did you use aII of it on him?
We used 95 out of 100,
am I right Bavuji?
Stop it!.
WiII you beat a powerfuI man
in station in my absence?
Sorry sir, I made mistake.
Stop it.
Sir is feeIing for missing the show.
Let's start aII over again.
Go...go...go away bIoody rascaI.
Have you come to get me
beaten up again?
Go...go...go away.
He's getting anxious,
can't you share his punishment?
You'II Iose your poIiticaI overweight.
I'm very deIicate.
I can't take the stick.
Bavuji...bye.-You thrash him.
One minute sir.
I thought I'II go to jaiI Iike Ramadasu,

No probIem, I'II share your agony.
You'II get beaten up and I'II cry.
Beat him.
TCTahalapTthy
Get it down...sIowIy...that's it.
What happened brother?
I want his peopIe.
Don't cry dear.
We needn't fearfor anything.
ShaII I teII you a story?
Once upon a time there Iived
a dacoit gang in ChambaI vaIIey,
Like these wastreIs.
A good poIice came there.
Like yourfather.
Father came and made
mincemeat of those dacoits.
Rathore knows the power of my
knock out punch from experience.
Vikram Rathore is dead.
The man coming now
is AthiIi Sathibabu.
You kiIIed Vikram Rathore treacherousIy.
But Sathibabu is a master crook himseIf.
You can't harm him in anyway.
Listen to me and vacate the
pIace before he comes here.
Otherwise you wiII feeI for it.
You'II be finished.
What's the meaning of it?
I'II teII you.
Jintha means base.
Thatha means baton.
Chithak means chutney.
It means baton wiII make
chutney of your base.
Another info brother-in-Iaw,
anybody who asked the meaning
of this got the stick.
First to eIder brother-in-Iaw, second...
Is he such a great man?
Let me see what he can do
if I kiII his daughter.
No need to touch my daughter
with bad intention,
even if you think of it, I'II kiII you.
He has come, I'II escape.
Go...go.
You were right.
Your man made a mincemeat of me.
But I can't pIay drums.
I know onIy to take Iives.
Who wiII offer aIms if you sit
here with begging bowI?
Go and seek aIms in viIIage.
There are four others depending on you.
Brother-in-Iaw.
My wife is shouting at me for not
coming home for a month.
