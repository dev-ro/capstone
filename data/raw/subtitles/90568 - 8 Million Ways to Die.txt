Do you know what we got in this town?
We got 8 million ways to die
Alright, let's cut the crap and

A baseball bat, you son of a bitch!
Damp shit!
Not necessarily, it could be anything
He may be real calm
He might try to jump you in the shower
and fing out he's got nothing to do with it
but linguini
Get upset
Some guys react real funny in situations like that
I didn't want you to worry
They asked you if you 've been drinking?

Hi Matt
This chip
This chip is the only thing I know that you got to
earn and pay for at the same time
And you pray to God you can hold it
Hold on to it every day of your life
So far being a drunk has cost me my job
My home, my health
I am not a cop
I am not married to Linda anymore
and my liver ...
There must be a bunch of mice now living
in my swiss cheese of liver, I tell you that
But I do I have this
and you people...That's a beginning
I do have one other thing to hold too, that even
the alcohol couldn't take away
I will always be Lories' dad
I only wish for her to be as greatful
for that as I am
Thanks

And now you go around fixing things?
That's a wrong way to put it
No if there's a leaky faucet that requires a (what?)

Matthew? How long has this been going on?
It sounds like a roe woose (what again?), daddy
Yes, I know
Honey, I'm gonna see you in the morning, alright?
I love you
OK, I love you tooBye bye
What's the problem Sunny?
Oh, no problem
I want to show you something
The street light makes my pussy hair glow in the dark
Cotton candy...the glow
I'll show you
Not only you are a whore, you are a
dump whore
What in your experience tells you a man is
more reliable because he's going to fuck you?
Its just what I've always done...
Predictable was not reliable
Stop...
Whether its for money or not, getting fucked is
usually getting fucked
This whole thing is making me very fucking nervous
Sunny! I want you to spit it out or you are out the door
You are out of here
No, dont...please dont
Tell me
I promise, Ill tell you everything, OK?
I dont want to be a whore any more
and I am afraid to tell Chans
You have to talk to him for me
He will listen to you
You can tell him you love me
Tell him you re crazy about me
You can tell him that we want to get married
Yes,tell him we 're going to get married, please
Come on, I'm gonna call him on the phone
No, you can't tell him on the phone
We go overthere then, come on, lets go
No, I cant go overthere, I am scared of Chans
Please let me stay here
Its safer for me, ok?
Let me get this straight, are you giving me
2.500 so Sunny doesn't have to fuck for a living?
Pimps...
...have been known to do bad things to girls
who leave them, right?
Look man
I pay all the girls around here a
pay salary for showing up to my club
I feed them
I lease their cars
I even have a trust fan set aside
in case something happens to one of them
But all I paid them for is their
availability to my customers
They pay me for absolutely nothing
Now, Sunny may be a high priced whore but..
...who, when and for how much its strictly her business
Look, I'm sorry Willie this is....
Hey, dont call me Willie man, dont say you are sorry
You dont have to be doing that
Look man, I am not a pimp, Im nobody's pimp
and if I was a pipm I'd be the most pussy-whomp(?)
pimp in this town
No one pays me for the priviledge of being a whore
Anyone around that wants to sell themselvers they do it
strictly on their own
Here
Its alright man.
I hate money man
-If its new, it cuts your fingers,if its old, it stinks.
You heard that. -Me and half the club
You got any Mallox?
No, you need Compozine
No, I want Mallox, this one makes me too sleepy
You say that later, let me handle things
Mr Scudder
Now, did she realy said that she was scared of me?
Yes, she indicated that
Dont play with that, alrigt, put that down, you know
nothing about art
It's expensive
Well I guess what you do to her, she left I guess
You know what she wanted me to tell you
Forget it
What? What, motherfucker dont play with me
She wanted me to tell you we were going
to get married
You like that?
Ill tell you what
Ill give you 2.500 to see you say that
with a straight face
So, what do you mean to tell her?
Mr Scudder, why don't you come with me so mr. Walker
can have some rest now?
You are Pit Rose around here, aren't you?
Who is Pit Rose?
Baseball, he is a playing manager
I have a sort like a business, yeah
Besides your own
I need 4 for each given
Arrita, blow the dice
I cant lose. See you later?
-If you are lucky
-I'm always lucky
How are you doing?
You had quite an educacion, haven't you?
Anyone who gets past the age of 2 has an education
Tram is here
What is it with you?
What do you have against me?
Its been like this ever since we met
I dont like cops
Im an ex-cop
Goodbye Mr Scudder
Tell Sunny she is no different
than the rest of us
That was a long drive for nothing
Dont you sleep?
Where did you get that?
I found it in your the drawer as I was looking
for a shirt to put on
He says you are free to go
Can't you see through him? its all an act
He 's gonna hurt me, I know it
Well fuck you, I dont need you anyway
I can do this on my own
Sunny
Please
Stay with me until I go on the plane this afternoon
OK, Ill take you to the airport
I got to pick up my daughter, take her riding
Ill be back at 12:00pm
You got to take me with you
Thanks a lot
You keep your airline ticket in a safe deposit box, eh?
Sure, that way no one knows where I'm going
until the last minute
what's the problem?
Nothing
I just thought I recognised that guy
Hey, this is not your bank
Right
God, I'm so paranoid
I'll be back in a sec, ok?
OK
Sunny
Im going to the shop next door to buy my
daughter a birthday present
OKIll be right back
Excuse me
Do you got any English riding boots
for girls, Size 6, black?
Let me check
I appreciate that, I am embarrassed
Sunny?
Shit!
You stupid son of a bitch
What the fuck is going on?
He's gonna hurt me, I know it
You do it right or you dont do it
You are a cop right?
I will pay you 5.000
Help me
Waking up is the hardest part
Fuck you I dont need you anyway
I can do this on my own
Nurse
How long have I been here?
I'm sorry, thats confidential information
But I am the patient
Those are the rules
I dont even know how I got here
Well, you didn't drive here, that much I can tell you
Whats your name?
Scudder...
What is the last day you remember Mr scudder?
The day before my daughters birthday
You dont expect me to remember that I suppose
Her birthday is the 3rd
Anyway, they brought you here the night of 6th
You ve been here 2 days Mr Scudder
I have to go now
I think you better shake it out a bit more
before you go
I got to go
One more drink and wherever it is you're going
you are gonna be dead before you get there
I'm sure you are right but I got to sign out
You've come for your car
You got my car?
Yes, I've parked it out back
After you looked at your hooker
I figured you wouldnt be in a shape to drive
Well you didn't prove me a liar
You do remember what happened
to your hooker friend Sunny
I 've saved you 96 in impound fees
Sorry
I owe you
Forget it
Look just...
Im a little pushed for time now man
What's get going?
There's been a murder, remember?
You cant remember anything
You fucking lush!
You are working in Sunny's case?
Thats right
You are not homicide
Im investigating office and the boys on
the homicide want to talk..
..to somebody around here who knows everybody
including you
Me why?
Maybe because you know Chans and he'd been into drugs
Maybe because you told them Sunny was leaving town
because she was terrified of Chans
-This doesnt make any sense man
-Homicide
All other investigations around here
take a damp
Homicide comes in, takes a good look at you,
they got nothing good to say about us
There is a dead body
An ex-cop who is a friends with a pimp who
works an after hours club
Gee, fellows, nothing looks too good around here
So we are in shit
Out
See you Joe
I just dont have time for you Matt
Hello
Hi, can I speak to Lorie?
Lorie doesnt want to speak to you
Is she there?
You were supposed to see her
last weekend
What are you talking about?
Poboys market, Jaime speaking
Poboys market, Jaime speaking
What the fuck are you doing with those logs, pendejo?
Bring them back by the leftovers of the
Christmas decorations
You say you don't want them to be sold
No, what I said is that there is no fucking way
I'm going to sell them
In a neighborhood where I cant make a profit
So Jaime please take them and stuck them overhere where they will
be out of the way, OK?
OK
I can hear what you' re saying man
but Mr Chans wants all the paper
Damn Scudder man
What the hell is wrong with you?
Put the gun away, I dont want any mistakes
Put it away
Damn man, you look like shit
I feel like shit
Hey look, why dont you sit down and talk, alright?
You are not going to throw up, are you?
I might
shit
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
This is my store
This is your store?
This is my store
What do you have to say for yourself?
What do you mean?
What do you mean what do I mean, man?
Whatever the fuck you told the homicide man
they had me jump up and down my black ass
for five and a half fucking hours
I was this ... luggage they were making a living doing
what they do best, What do you mean what do I mean?
I don't know what I told homicide
Sunny got killed Sunny, I got drunk
I blacked out
You blacked out
So in other words, you could have said anything
about me, right?
Not anything, I am an alcoholic, I'm not a liar
You took Sunnys money man, what the fuck for?
Everybody who knows me knows better man
That woman wasn't worried about me for a second
You were going around making smoke without a fire
She was scared
She wasn't scared of me, man
Bitch
Fuck me man
Scudder god damned man!
All I can tell you she told me
she was scared
I told that the homicide and you are a suspect motherfucker
-The suspect, motherfucker
-And so am I
Are we going to continue with this add and share relationship?
You got to help me find why she was scared
Get me out of problems, will you
Fuck
What the fuck do you want from me man?
I want you to tell me who was closest to Sunny
Sarah was
And she knows who was
I 'll have Sarah call you
Better yet, I 'll call her for you, right?
Do me a favor, get the fuck out of my car
You got a lot of Hispanics working here
So what man? You work for immigration now?
Checking green cards?
Lets go big man
Get Sarah on the phone
You are using this place as your laundry
or you are going law jet?
What do you think?
I haven't got long
-All you girls live here?
-I do
What regular customers liked Sunny?
They all did
Any that...
Thank you very much Sarah
Hi teach
Any she liked?
Not a one
Did she see any other customers with an irregularity?
Thats a different question
Who did she see?
Moore, Silver Steam, Virtor Serm, Mark Margota
If you knew Sunny at all
You had to know she was a natural born victim
I mean, some guy would want to tire her up
hanging out of the window upside down
and toss marmelade on her bottom
Somebody asked her to do that?
I'm giving an example
she'd come to me and say "Gee, Sarah, do I have to?"
and I would toss the guy out
You meaning you?
Me or whatever
Chans doesn't bet with his ass or mine
Thats why we get along
If even smells a problem with a customer
they are out of here
What would you call a problem?
Cheating, drugs, violence
Is that it?
Sarah, you know what happened to Sunny...
...can happen to any of you girls
-I really dont think so
-You don't -No, I don't
Because none of the other girls
have you protecting them, Mr Scudder
And by the way, I think you 're fucking freeloader
a lash and you got Sunny killed
What about Angel Maldonado
What about him?
Did she see him, was she seing him?
No, Angel's expressed interest seems
to be in me
Look, Sunny may have seen him, alright?
But that must have been a long time ago
Why don't you ask Angel?
At ten
Come on we need to buy Monica a car
Do you have money? Give it all
Mundo bring me 25,000
Stop eating man
Two minutes guys
Get some drinks here
Come on, roll the dice or pass them
What,are you out of money or something?
Whats with you buddy?
Crazy or something?
Stop it!
Tirate, tirate
Look who is here to protect me...
The Queen of the casino
-Hey, whats the problem?
-The old guy here couldnt give me 2 minutes
-What do you need?
-All you have to get -5,000
Thanks, I take care of you later
Sarah its about Sunny
-Look, I don't wonna talk to you anymore
-Excuse me, senora Sarah?
Who are you? How did you get in here?
Im Carlos Gutierrez, I'm the bartender
Sunny recommended
Look man, Im sorry, could you
just sort of vamp a minute?
Not bad wine a little help from Sarah
By the way where is she?
Went with that guy
Keep the ticket
Take it easy, no problem
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut up!
Sarah?
Sarah, whats going on baby?
Before you open your mouth you're going
to be talking to Sunnys killer
-It was Maldonado
-What the fuck are you talking about
Even if you don't believe me,
you've got to believe he is capable of doing it
Now answer
Go on, answer
Sarah!
Give me a break Angel
Ive been working all night
We'll be back in a while
Want to play games?
We'll play games
-Prick!
-Fucking cunt!
Sunny was getting ready to leave town
She got a bunch of staff put in a safe deposit box
Shit!
-It's mot funny
-I didn't say a word, come on
I 've got her book
In the book there's a bunch of...
Give me your shoes
In the book was this necklace
This emerald necklace with a missing stone and
that missing stone was in Angels ring
You don't dissapear without these, don't you
You liked that
-Liked what?
-Roughing me up
Roughing up?
You think that was roughing you up?
Would you like to see what roughing up is?
This is kidnapping you lash
I hope you are sober enough to realise...
Hey, come on, what we 've been doing
trading accusations here?
For a half assed hooker you are an extremely
arrogant woman, you know that?
What you said before about Sunny being a
hopeless victim makes me wanna...
Rough me up?
-Just answer me the question
-What question?
About Maldonado and Willy
-All I know is Angel has been trying to get
Chans to go into business with him for as long as I know
-what do you mean, in what way?
I dont know exactly, to use
the club, to sell drugs
Maldonado deals in Ks, look at this
Recognise any of those names?
The third from above ,Carlos Gutierrez,
the bartender
I got this out of Sunny's book
Do you know those guys?
Where are we going?
Boy, this better not be some
wacked out fantasy of yours
Did you do both locks, get the back door?
Yeah
Thanks a lot Slim
We'll be out of here in half hour
Just hold the gunfire to a minimum
One vodka straight up, please
A straight up for the lady
Are you scared?
What do you having?
A coke, please Slim
A coke for the big spender
Do you think he's dangerous?
Well yeah
I mean imminently
Like tonight?
-You don't wonna get more of that
-What about?
Its tough drink
Another vodka for the lady
alright, have another
Care to join me?
No, thanks
Shouldn't we go to the police?
With what? Three green rocks?
If we bring all that money Sunny had
to the homicide
they 're gonna think she ripped off Chans
If she ripped off anybody, it was Maldonado
I dont think she did it, though
I know it's got something to do with coke
What I got to do is I got to get to buy
it from Angel
Should make a deal
Then we go to homicide
Are you listening to me?
Do you give a shit?
What do you want from me?
Look, I'm really fucking nervous here,
alright?
So Im drinking and I hate to drink alone
I almost never do
-What? Drink alone?
-Drink period
Break your diet tonight
You have my permission
Tender, ha?
Someone tried to throw my right nut
to the pacific ocean about an hour ago
A little sensitive, yeah
Alright
OK, lets get serious
Im not drinking, sit down, will you?
Enough with this shit
You made me lose my train of thoughts
Aren't we going to tell Chans?
What would you like want to tell Chans?
You had it cleaned and pressed
You really liked Sunny, didn't you?
Yeah I did
So did I
What did you like about her most?
What do you like about anybody?
Is it that she was a good fuck
or is it that you feel guilty?
Did you enjoy making love to her?
Oh, Christ
I'm jealous
Sarah, what the hell are you doing?
-Im gonna fuck you so good
-Sarah...
They 've never fucked you like this
Lets get to the bathroom
You're not gonna feel a think
don't to worry
Some water
God
What happened?
Oh god...At least you staid sober
You are not a mindless lash, after all
Thank you
I guess I misjudged you
You're not just an opportunistic prick who
would fuck mud if it move a little
and not argue too much
But that's OK you know, you're no different from
most men in the situation, dont get me wrong
Lady nobody can get you wrong
It's real simple, you threw up on me
I threw you in the shower
When you burf on me
It's like putting salt on a birds tail
Bird dont fly
I don't fuck
House rule
I never touched you
You are a son of a bitch
I'm moving up in the world
A moment ago I was an opportunistic prick
For your information
-You move more like concrete than you do mud
-How do you know how I move in bed
Maybe I misjudged you
Its about as likely as you think you
misjudged me
You want some coffee?
Id love some, thank you

Do they think men like that or what?
Yes,most men do

You consider yourself a happy person?
I was happy when I was dancing
But I wasnt very good at it
I could't make a living
I came here from Minneapolis
I met up with these people and...
I got into the life
I made a lot of money
Easy money
Why give it up for free, right?
We all got our addictions
Is that your daughter?
Yeah
She is qute
Yes, she is
She is my best friend
She looks like you
Are you close with your dad?
No, he's dead
He was an alcoholic
You know whats the worst thing
about that disease
Is that you...
...you lose the closeness with the
people you love
Its hard to reach out for help
Shit
Hard for me
Im a cry baby
Scudder
You didnt tell me you were gonna bring
the light of my life here today
-Hi Angel
-How are you doing, baby?
You are not looking too good,
whats wrong?
I'm not feeling too good
Can I make you deside to bright up a little?
She's my fuck for the day
Have a little respect here, my man
Angel, you can do better than that
Believe me
OK
How about a snow cone?
Real saved ice
Nice car
One flavor today, passion fruit
What is this?
Its good for people when they're in love
Won't you join me in the car, relax
Snow cones
Ill be right back
OK
Class
Lets go baby, talk to me, I dont got all day
Talk to me straight, come on
I dont think we should bullshit
eachother, alright Angel?
I know you did Sunny, ok?
-Personally I don't give a fuck of what you did..
-Wait a second
You accuse me of doing something to Sunny?
Is that what you came here to do?
I know you did it , you know you did it
Lets not bullshit eachother, ok?
This guy is accusing me of killing Sunny
We are talking code now? What is this?
Talk talk but talk about something that
interests me,ok?
OK lets talk about making some money
Do I look like I need to make money?
-Relax baby -Compared to me?
Compared to me you are doing fantastic
But say that if you have
5.000 $ then you want 10.000$
So I got 250.000
-I want a weight of the white stuff
-The what? The White stuff
-The White stuff?
-The white stuff
-Isn't that a movie about astronauts?
-I know the game,I know you did Sunny
I told you, lay off that shit
Im geting a little fucking tired of you accusing
me of something I didnt do
Either fucking talk to me straight or...
Fuck you! Hear what I say?
Easy
You aren't going to survive this shit if you
hit me with this blackmail shit
Youd better be aware...
Am I supposed to be intimidating about that?
Take your best shot
Listen, you don't want that to happen baby
You don't want that to happen, believe me
Ok, my fault, Im sorry
I didnt get laid today
We all have our problems
I got laid
You know how its jumping out of my skin
That's because I hold back
You hold back?
You dont think so?
I don't think so
Come over here
Watch the back here
Angel, we are getting into an (.......) relationship...
No, you are getting
There are some risks about blackmailing
a murderer, right?
-You don't think so?
-I dont think so
I tell you what
Why don't just fuck you right from here
Fuck me from there?
Are you rubber man?
Try me
You are a tough motherfucker
I dont want to talk to you any more
Move on from this shit about blackmail and Sunny
because the reality situation is I didn't do it
What can I say Scudder, you've got me wrong
I dont think so
And your time is up, Im tired of this shit
OK,what about Chans?
What?
Thats stuff, isn't?
What about Chans?
He is a good friend of mine
Good friend my ass, he don't mean shit to you
Keep smiling
A liitle more interesting now, eh?
Scudder isn't such a fucking damp shit
Ill tell you what Scudder. If you
are so smart, how about Sarah over there?
Dont forget her. Are you filling her head
with that stuff too?
That's not what I've been filling
her head with, no
Why are you being so disrespectful, Scudder?
Think about that
Why would I ever do business with someone
who is so disrespectful?
No more talk babe
You time is up
-Hey look...
-No more talk baby. Don't press it
Sarah
Your friend here is a very rude boy
I'm not glad to see he takes such a bad
care of you
It gives us a little excuse to do a little shopping
Ill get some nice things for you and then we
go over my place and make off some lost time
Great baby
Great baby
Scudder, dont look so sad, I tell you what
There is something about you Scudder that
I like, honestly
So, Ill tell you what
Im putting together this snow cone franchise
Now you 're talking
I may need some partners, so why don't
you go ask your friend Chans for a  little money
-250.000, let me double your cash
-Chans! -Chans, that's right
-You know Chans
-I dont want to get Chans involved...
Then go to a fucking bank man, I dont care
where you get it, ask your mother
Reality is I need 500.000$. You come up
with that cash and maybe we talk
OK? Maybe
In the mean time I got a date
So call me, you got my number
Hurts to see your baby go, eh Scudder?
Its the price to pay for doing
business my man. You got my number
Surpsise! Surprise!
How would you like to get back
into dope business?
What?
Angel killed Sunny
How do you know that?
He told me
That little lizard motherfucker
I got to get 250.000 from you
to make a deal with him
250.000 $ of my money? Bullshit
Hes got Sarah
What do you mean he's got Sarah, man
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I thought she was supposed to be with you
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You're gonna push one fucking time
One fucking time it is
Keep coming, come on, come on asshole
-You are big but you can still bleed
-Put the gun down
-We want no mistakes
-Come on, lets take a walk
-I know youre pissed
-You got it right I am pissed, you're
out of your fucking mind
Why did you get me involved in this shit?
Like I had no choice, asshole
You tell me something man, why you coming
here with this shit now?
-Why didnt you bring it here in the first place?
-I didnt trust you
As far as I know,you could have been with Maldonado
man, how am I supposed to know?
Fuck you and fuck Angel
I got something for Angel
Nosego
Get the UZI, get the A-Ks, get the whole box
of shit man
You 're gonna get her killed Will
Hold it
-Just listen to my plan
-Fuck you!
Just fucking cool it, will you man?
Look, if I make this deal I'm gonna
probably get Sarah out of there
Don't fuck this up man
-You got any Mallox? -No
-Here is my last one
-Good afternoon
-Hey there
Look whos hereHow is going on Scudder?
Ive got the money
-You got the money? -Yeah
-Interesting
What do you think of my house?
I just bought it
-Its great.
-Great?
-It's unique
-That's right baby, its Gaudi
Do you know Gaudi?
No
Check him out.Come on
I ll show you around
Here is a little passage on
the truth and his work
Just as elegance and beauty where
inseparable for Gaudi
Beuty and truth were identical for him
Beauty was the manifestation of truth
Without truth there could be no beauty
Dig that?
Far east
Far east, far out man
See this here
He was interested in getting everything
kind of 45 degree angles
So the sun light -you dig that?- when it hits
at that angle it creates the idea of conditions
to observe nature and the elements
Twelve rooms baby
Right here I am gonna build a big
fucking Gaudi palace for myself
If you behave you might be invited
You dig him?
I dig him, he's great
Ill tell you what. Gilberto bring me
another book. Im gonna give you one of these
The guy had no apprentices and no successors
He's the best
Sarita
Look who came to visit
She's great, right?
Whos that? Its the Tiger
I 'll talk to him
Excuse me, Sarita babe, can you pour
me one of those?
Take good care of her, Ill be right back
You look like shit
You had a nice time?
Depends on what you call nice
Chans think I got to save for myself
He wants to fuck me and kill you
He actually said that?
More or less
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna drink
What are you going to do?
Not too close
She looks great, eh?
Babe, why dont you go powder your nose
save me so?
Thank you
Maybe you can put on the other dress, 
not the white one, the other one we liked
Try it to see how that feels
I love you
Its a piece of work
-So, I've got the money
-You've got the money, I know
Chans came through, eh?
Lets just do the deal
Are you looking for a place here in 
the neighborhood, next to litttle Angel?
-You got the shit here or what?
-Come on Scudder
You know I cant deal with you baby
What do you mean?
You know what I mean
You take me for a fool?
You try to bust me, man
Angel come on
Come on Scudder, let's not play the game
You want to play the game? I'll play the game
My papers are ready, my franchise are ready,
my lawyers are at town, call me next week
I just want to do a little business with you man
You think I'm a fool?
You are being disrespectful and rude
Rude?
You were rude all the way the fucking street 
with Sunny, weren't you?
Rude
Let me explain to you what happened to Sunny
What happened to her is people think 
that if you have
to kill somebody in the course
of doing business
Sometimes it pays to advertise
Make it messy, remind people that they
bleed when they die
Might even prevent some more killings
Understand where I'm coming from?
You are really a humanitarian, aren't you
I am
OK, no more fucking bullshit man
I know you dig Sarah
I love her just as much as you do,
you understand what I'm saying?
And I loved Sunny just as much
 But it's in your hands, baby
So dont make a fucking mistake
Think about that man
Tell me how you feel next week
Mr. Scudder here needs to go
Come on, let's get out of here
Head over your market, man
How do you work this thing?
Just dial the number
Maybe I saw something in there
gave me an idea.
I got him if I'm right
What did he say?
He said he loves her too
Detective sergeant Joe Darkin please
He loves her too? What the fuck does
that mean?What's that?
Sunny was working for Maldonado
Bullshit, no way
-She wanted out, thats why he killed her
-That's shit
You were right
-She wasnt afraid of you, she was afraid of him
-So why did she lie about me?
Its a hell of lot easier to get somebody
to protect you against a pimp
that a bunch of wacked out drug dealers
that hack you up
He was trying to buy into your club, right?
I didnt want to do business with that fuck
Chans, you might not be in business with him
he's in business with you
-How much could he roll to the club?
-Not your club, to the markets
Your vans, your managers, the batch boys.
Thats how he was using Sunny
She was getting his guys in your operation
Yeah, Im holding
Lets go, come on
Has to be in here
Check it out man
I owe you one
As soon as we figure out who is who
somebody'll be back to let you out
So get close together, stay warm
Think it the overtime
Sit down
Wait, you can't, I won't be able to
see the side of the mirror
Lets use my car
Driving me crazy...I've got some remedy
Food of the Gods, kind of life
for being with you
It's better than ever I thought it would be
I'm gonna make you so happy
You just got to forget about everybody
what everybody says
Forget about pressures, forget Chans 
and all the bullshit
You don't have to work anymore
You understand what I'm saying
Anything you need, anything you ever want
you're gonna have
Im going to take care of you
You're gonna be my queen
You got to buy a different dress though
You hanging around here my boys will get excited
Put that up
You picked it out 
I know, but we were there alone
You didn't give me my little kiss today.
Can I got a kiss?
You think I killed Sunny?
That's a no? A no-no or no-yes?
OK
Scudder, wrong place wrong time baby
Angel, I dont mean to be rude but...
We've just ripped off 150
of your logs man.
And your coke, you know what I mean?
If you want it back you meet me in 
45 minutes
Pier 20 in San Pedro
I want Sarah
Oh, you want Sarah
You heard me, San Pedro,
45 minutes, pier 20. Be there
You know what your boyfriend says?
-He is not my boyfriend.
-Maybe not
He's got all my coke, he says
he's got all my coke
And I don't know how he found out
I just
He wants you
He wants to exchange my coke for you 
He is not my friend
Come on baby come on baby
Im not lying to you baby
-You're not lying to me?
-No,I'm not lying. -OK
I'll tell you what
I let go all my coke
I forget about it
If you go away with me
-Ill go away with you. -No, no...
-No baby, I want to go away with you
-Its bullshit, I see right fucking through you, man, why...
-I always wanted you
Why are you doing this to me?
Im sorry
Lets go, we have work to do
Dont forget we were partners once
-Matt saved my life
-Good enough for me
-What you say Matt.
-Hey Joe
Brought you a flag-jacket
and the smoke grenades you wanted
Thanks I 've got my own
This is Art Franser, we're gonna
be using his team
-How you doing
-Matt Scudder
-That's my man, Buster. 
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi Buster. 
I got Chans unloading the logs
over warehouse 154
Here is a rough map of the place
Here is the warehouse
the surounding area
I dont know your guys, I figure out 
you handle your tactics
-What do you think?
-What's in this warehouse?
It's empty but
-We got  a little office down here in the end
-Empty?
Its going to be a tactical nightmare
Buster
Yes boss?
I want you to go overthere and take a look at this.
Do you know where this place is?
-I know exactly where it is sir
I want you to get the guys, head overthere
Ill meet you overthere in about 5 minutes

I'm Matt Scudder,I'm an alcoholic
Hi Matt
Feeling pretty good today
When I first came in this program 
about a year ago
I didnt really believe this stuff
I didn't think it could really work
I wanted to believe it but I couldnt
I...
I live in a world I didn't make
I know that now
It took me a long time to come to 
that realization, had to be really 
beaten into that reasonableness
When I first came I thought I 
was too smart for this program
I thought I had all the answers
I had to keep coming back here time after...
I failed the program 3 times
But I've been dry a month now
No, it isn't a month, no it is 5 weeks now
This time I may do it for good
I feel a new strength now
This is really a gift
I'm not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth
I'm just gonna ride that sucker
When I put my head on the pillow
And I fall asleep without loosing my senses
When I wake up I have no hangover
I am in love, what more can I say
Its a great feeling
