- This is my town, it's just a couple streets,
a park and a lake, my little world all of its own.
It's the kind of town
where nobody moves out and
almost nobody moves in.
School just ended the day before
and that meant three months of freedom.
Three months of hanging out 
with my mismatched collection
of best friends like Jeff and Manny.
Jeff was a year older than us
but he acts like he was three years younger
so it all works out.
- Come on.
- His mom died a couple of years ago
but he never talks about it.
Then there's Manny.
Manny was raised by his mom
because his dad's in the military
and spends most of his time overseas.
Despite that, Manny is the funniest kid we know.
One time Manny said something so funny
he made me shoot hot chocolate out of my nose.
And yeah, of course there were bullies,
Eddie the Turd and Howie the Hood.
No one calls him the Turd to his face,
but it pretty much sums him up.
Now Howie, nobody knows much about Howie
except that he's equal parts weird and nasty.
- Bye Manny.
- Bye, Julie.
- Bye, Julie.
- And that's me Benji.
I live on a farm with my mom and dad.
My dad says that without our 
farm the town would go hungry
as if we live in some 
remote jungle without cars or pizza.
- Go.
- Yo you scared. You scared.
- You can't push. That's a personal foul.
A defender can't stop the receiver's ability
from making the catch.
- But we're both on offense.
- Just go.
- Come on, Jeff.
- Every town has a sweet old crazy lady
and ours is Ms. Odell.
Ms. Odell has a cat named Socrates
that she keeps on a leash on the porch.
We all pretend it's not weird but,
yeah, it's pretty weird. - Benji!
- Hey, Ms. Odell.
- A ha, that's one. - What?
- We're playing three flies up. I have one.
- What are you talking about? 
When did we decide that?
- Now.
Since now? Really?
- What kind of bird is that?
- What bird?
- Up there see. That branch right there.
Been there all morning.
- Oh I see it. That's a white crowned sparrow.
Wow.
- Hey what?
- She's literally turning into a witch right now.
- Man why are you messing with them, it's not worth it.
- Let's go.
- Hey, you hear about the new family
that moved into Jimmy's old house?
- Yeah, I wonder if they speak English.
- Well let's go find out.
- Jeff go long.
- What do you mean go long,
I'm like three feet behind you, idiot.
What's this?
That is the oldest bike I've ever seen.
- Oh hello.
- Greetings.
- Greetings?
- It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Roland.
- You talk funny. - I'm-
- We're from Scotland.
- Really?
- So, uh, so, uh, you're a McSomething then?
- Yes, McIntosh, as it happens.
- Roland, do you mind helping me with this?
- We can help.
- Can we carry something for you, ma'am?
- Don't worry, ma'am, I'll get the door.
- That would be lovely, thank you.
These go in Roland's room. - Oh, okay.
- Geez how many steps are in this place?
- What do you care you're not carrying anything.
- I got the football.
- There's something strange about this room.
- Do you mean the velvet, 
the dragon, or the chair?
- I don't know. It's just sort of creepy.
- It's not funny, man.
- Funniest thing I've seen all day.
- Guys, look.
It's Roland.
- No!
- So you like the painting?
- It's very, uh-
- Is that you in your Sunday skirt?
- No. That's my great grandfather, 
whom I am named after.
It's his confirmation portrait, actually.
He was the last knight in our family.
- A knight? A real knight?
- Sit down, I'd like to show you guys something.
This is the Family Chronicle.
It is a true story.
- We were all in a trance,
we listened to Roland's 
passionate voice telling tales
of valor and noble deeds from his ancestor.
As he told these amazing stories
one thought kept on repeating in my mind,
this kid's full of crap.
But the more he talked I couldn't help
but imagine what it was like back then 
to live in a castle,
feast on whatever kind of 
animals they had back then
and sit in front of a giant fireplace
underneath the family coat of arms.
Honestly I don't know if any of this was true
but I couldn't wait to hear more.
- Hey, what do you guys think?
Professional purple or power pink?
- Pink. - Purple.
- Purple. Yeah purple.
- You guys worried about 
the SuperMart opening?
- Worried? I ain't worried.
Jason and I definitely have our own opinions
about the future of his store.
You know he's been taking 
meetings with this Mr. Scrubb guy.
- Are you gonna say something?
You know our farm is the only reason
why people still love that grocery store.
- And Jason's still my boss.
- Well I met that Mr. Scrubb.
He bought a foreclosure alongside the river.
He's not all bad.
- Not all bad?
- I met the new family 
that moved into Jimmy's old house.
They got a son named Roland 
and he seems pretty cool.
And they're Scottish too.
- His father is part of a tech start-up in the city.
- His headboard looks like
something out of a movie.
- Oh yeah? Which movie?
- I don't know.
Just like some Medieval awesome movie
that you won't let me watch.
Like this.
Hey Roland. Do you miss home?
- Living in Scotland was tolerable,
but I found it inadequate 
in certain particulars.
- Were you forced to move here?
Like some bad stuff went down
and your family had to 
get off the island fast?
- No. Like I said, new business for my father.
- Don't they have business in Scotland?
- Seriously, Manny?
- I don't know, I'm just asking.
- Maybe they were all eaten 
by the Loch Ness Monster?
- Shut up man.
- Yes, Manny.
Business, running water, indoor toilets, castles.
- Castles?
- Yes, castles.
Some of my ancient relatives 
lived in and defended them.
- No way.
You're just saying that
because it sounds cool with your accent.
- Bam! Five skips, halfway across.
Beat that Scotland!
- No way!
- That was four! It was only four.
- It went like a mile past yours, Jeff.
You want some ice for that burn?
- Is it more considerable to go far
or have an abundance of skips?
- Distance doesn't matter. 
Those are the rules.
- Why do you always make up rules
after we've started playing something?
- Then I concede.
- What?
- You win. Good game.
- Ah. This is the best.
The lake all to ourselves.
Good times with friends. Paradise.
- What?
- What? Screw you guys!
- Manny was right. This is the best.
The sun high above our heads
and not a care in the world, that's paradise.
We were laughing because we were friends
and everything was funny,
the cliff swallows above our heads,
the story of old sailors, Manny's stupid jokes,
Jeff's ridiculously low voice,
Roland's way of talking and 
the sound of my own laughter.
As different as Roland is,
 I liked having him around.
I wanted to be like him.
It felt like while he's here, I would be safe,
and nothing bad would happen.
- Hey!
- Hey what?
- Howdy boys.
- Watch it.
- Watch what?
- Hey, why'd you say anything?
- Grab your stuff, guys, let's go.
- Who are these gentlemen?
- They are no gentlemen.
- Is that so?
So where do you guys think you're going?
Looking for Fish and Chips 
with your new Willie-buddy?
- My name is Roland and I'm from Scotland
- Shut up.
We're just here doing some discount shopping.
Hey, I've always wanted a pair of these.
Oh, shoot, it looks like they don't work.
- What? You can't see Big Bird up close now?
- Hey, c'mon. That's my Dad's.
- Oh yeah, come and get it then.
- This one, hey.
- Here, here, come on.
- Oh nice. Go!
Come on it's your dad's.
Go long, go long.
Here we go, here we go, hey!
- Oh, you can't get it?
- What do you think you're doing?
- I don't know who you are 
or what your problem is,
but you ought to know that 
only cowards make sport
of picking on younger kids.
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm not the one who thinks I'm someone.
- Take him.
Ready to go back. - C'mon man, cut it out.
- You know, I just might.
- Drop that knife and let go of that boy, right now!
- And what are you gonna do? 
Hm, stick us to death?
- There's one way to find out.
- This isn't over old lady.
- Man, I can't believe you talked
to Howie like that!
- Howie is a coward.
And like all cowards,
he hides behind his insecure black armor
of hate and violence.
- Lots of McBalls man.
Unbelievable! - Here you go?
- Sorry about your b'nocs.
- My own fault.
- For you. - Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Benji's afraid of the water.
- Yeah, which explains the smell.
- Hey everybody. 
Everybody's talking about you.
They say you've been going 
from cornbread chef to Gran-bo.
- Is that so? You know how this town gossips.
- I see you've been branching out.
- What nobody got that?
- Now, Roland. What's your story?
Tell us something about your family.
- I descend from Scottish kings and knights.
- Oh my.
- One of my ancestors was Rufus Barebottom.
He once fought 20 Englishmen single-handedly.
- Why was his name Barebottom?
- Because he didn't wear anything under his kilt.
- You mean his skirt.
- Dude, you're making this up.
- It's actually very common 
for people to wear kilts
in the old days in Scotland and they still do,
at formal occasions and festivals.
- Haven't you boys seen "Braveheart"?
- That's the movie my dad won't let me see!
- Oh yeah, it's a great one,
except it's factually inaccurate.
My great-great-great-great-great
great-great-great-great-
great-great-grandfather was Robert the Bruce,
King of Scotland.
- Seriously?
- You were holding out on us.
- Nah, he's just lying.
- It's true.
I can show you.
- I still say, this doesn't prove anything.
- King Barebottom that just sounds made up.
- He wasn't a king, he was a knight.
- What's the difference?
- One fights and one rules.
- I think that if you fight, you rule!
- Even if you fight in your Sunday skirt?
- Ow! What was that for?
- Finally!
- In Scotland a police siren
usually signifies something bad.
- Yeah, but in Jeff's defense 
nothing happens in this town.
- Guys, it looks like they're 
headed for Ms. Odell's house.
- Benjamin!
- What happened?
- He's ruined!
- Holy.
- There was so much screaming,
is that what the screaming was about?
- Yep.
- What are you going to do about this?
- I'll get the FBI right on it.
- Well he's not that bad.
- Yeah, it'll grow back.
- Nah it kinda looks like an alien bro.
- Is that what all this is about?
It's a cat people, who gives a crap?
Jeff c'mon.
Jeff!
- Nothing here for you boys to see.
- We're just taking Roland you-know-where.
- Be careful back there.
- I have no idea what that means.
- Now, you have to swear to secrecy.
This is our very special secret hiding place!
- I understand.
- Swear?
- I do.
- Then say it.
- I swear that this gathering will remain
completely clandestine on 
the grave of Robert the Bruce.
- You're so weird, man.
- We have to do something.
- Yeah, she loved that cat.
- Actually, now that I think about it,
it does kinda look cool now.
- Yeah, that's not funny, Jeff.
She's always helping us, helping all of us.
We have to get those guys back.
- Live pure, speak true, right wrong, 
follow the King.
- What did you say?
- The Knight's Code.
- Really? Fantasy time is 
not gonna help right now, Roland.
Why do you always have to 
say something so stupid, dude?
- Guys. Calm down.
- If it wasn't for her
they would have beat the crap out of Roland.
And we didn't lift a finger.
- You could have done something!
Or what, huh? Are you a chicken?
You don't have the guts anymore?
- Oh, oh so now you're mister tough-guy, right?
You're always thinking 
you're the toughest one here.
- I shaved the cat? I'm Eddie, I'm Howie?
- Shut up, Jeff. - Stop it.
We certainly won't be able to deal
with those two scoundrels by arguing.
And fighting won't help Miss Odell either.
We have to demonstrate unyielding courage
in the face of adversity.
If we intend to never 
let Howie and Eddie get away
with this kind of behavior again
then we have to band together.
- Whoa! - Dang, man.
- Wait, you're leaving? 
But that was such an awesome speech.
- Stay here.
- Roland's right, guys.
I mean whether you like it or not 
we have to stand together.
- To do what?
Huh?
- I am Roland the Dragon!
A Knight of the Order of the Red Dragon!
I fight to defend the rights of the weak,
the oppressed, and the downtrodden,
to seek truth, for justice, against injustice.
Who will join me?
- I will, Sir Roland the Dragon.
- Is there anyone else here who will join me?
To avenge Socrates!
- Yes, absolutely.
I will too.
- Yeah.
- Knights! We would be real knights!
With a noble mission with swords and shields
and capes and helmets!
We would be invincible!
We dedicated every spare minute
to the armory at Roland's house.
We had no time for football or fishing.
- Well done, Manny.
- We scoured every book Roland had looking
for a really cool crest,
the perfect symbol to represent each of us.
We went into the garage as boys,
and emerged as a solemn group of knights.
This was our moment.
Behind these uniforms 
and weapons lies a holy purpose,
an unwavering commitment.
For justice, brave and true.
We were knights, warriors 
of righteousness ready for battle.
- Sir Jeff, why have you 
presented the Tiger?
- Because a tiger kicketh.
- Rise, stand before me.
So while your joke was funny in ancient legend says
that the tribal confederation of peoples,
known as Picts, landed in Northern Scotland
and were attacked by wildcats.
So fierce were these creatures
that the Picts adopted the tiger
as their tribal symbol and name.
- I once saw a buffalo kill a tiger.
- No way a buffalo could beat a tiger.
- Look it up.
- Guys, shut up. Roland, continue.
- I, Roland the Dragon, hereby declare
that you are now Jeff the Tiger,
Knight of the Order of the Red Dragon.
- A bird. What a shocker.
- Shut up, Jeff.
- Ancient Celts believed that the voice
of the dove was a mourning call.
That when its cry was heard,
it indicated that the soul was passing
from the earth in peace.
- Really?
- Yes, the dove represents, grace, and peace
along with the promise 
of safekeeping from storms.
- Storms are cool, I guess.
- We are an Order, 
strong together in our diversity.
A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
- But there are four of us.
- 3 1/2 really.
- Can we focus?
- I, Roland the Dragon, hereby declare
that you are now Benji the Dove,
Knight of the Order of the Red Dragon.
- It's a eagle-lion.
- It's a griffin!
The king of all beasts with the king of all birds.
- Well done, Manny.
A griffin is a kind and powerful creature,
the king of all creatures.
- In your face!
- I, Roland the Dragon, hereby declare
that you are now Manny the Griffin,
valiant Knight in the Order of the Red Dragon.
All right. Our Heraldry is complete.
Next on the agenda is fencing practice!
- Fantastic! Onward, men!
Where are we going?
- We begin in pairs, I against Benji the Dove,
Jeff the Tiger against Manny the Griffin.
It is not allowed to hit in the face or stab in the stomach.
If the sword gets behind the opponent's shield,
then that's a point,
unless the opponent parries with his sword.
- What's a parry?
A parry is a defensive fencing maneuver
intended to deflect or block an incoming attack, like this.
- Cool!
- Strike!
Strike!
Strike!
Three points constitutes a victory.
So, let us begin!
One point!
- Gotcha.
- One point!
Two points.
- Did you guys see that?
- Manny. Manny.
Manny get up. You okay?
Manny, come on, stand up.
What's the matter with you?
This is practice, not a battle.
- I won! He only got two points on me!
- He hit you three times and we saw it.
- How could you see? 
You were all the way up there.
- I was watching very carefully.
You didn't have to hurt him!
- It's nothing, man, he's fine. 
I didn't hurt him.
You're fine right? See he's fine.
You know all right maybe it was my fault,
maybe my sword is a little heavy, man.
I didn't mean to hurt him though. It's all good.
- I got to go in for supper.
- I was the one who won.
Whatever.
Dad, Dad, I fought all three of them, 
I beat them all!
I beat all of them.
Benji came at me like that
and then Manny came behind me like that.
Dad?
- What are you wearing?
Have you finally lost your mind?
What is that a pussy cat?
- No, it's a tiger. 
You know like a symbol, a coat of arms.
- Alright. Go on get out.
Don't wave that thing in here.
- Hey, Dad, you see this scratch right here?
You know where that came from?
I broke Manny's shield in a single blow!
- Oh yeah?
- Dad, you cut me!
- Our initial training is now complete.
The first mission of the Order of the Red Dragon is
to avenge Socrates.
Fellow Knights, How shall Howie the Hood
and Eddie the Turd pay for their misdeeds?
- Did you just make that?
If only they had a dog
or some other pet that we could shave.
- No. That wouldn't do at all.
- Why not? It would be a just payback.
For justice, brave and true, right?
- No, shaving an innocent animal wouldn't be just
in this case, nor in any case, for that matter.
- I don't know about Howie 
but Eddie doesn't have any pets.
- He has a girlfriend.
- That's it!
We could exact a punishment so wildly original
that he'll never see it coming.
- We shave his girlfriend?
- No, I have something better in mind.
It appears this young turd comes from money.
- Hey, is that his girlfriend? Ew.
- Did he just bite her?
- Go, go.
Oh hey, son. Still an idiot?
- You know it, Dad!
- Oh and who is this pretty young lady pretending
to like you?
- Just another girl using me for your money, Dad.
- Oh, I know what that feels like.
- Okay, I'll just be down here
boring your mother to death.
- Somebody please shoot me. Let's go!
- Help me with the ladder.
- Ready? - Yeah.
- Aren't you afraid of heights?
- I am not. Okay.
- It's true. In the third grade.
- Okay I'm just gonna do it.
For justice. Brave and strong.
- Benji if you feel like you're gonna fall
just aim for Manny.
- Shut up idiot.
- For Socrates!
The first quest of The Order
of the Red Dragon was a raging success.
Justice prevailed.
The balance of power was restored.
Nothing could stop us.
- A True Knight must have the courage
to stand up for those principles
which he believes are right,
especially in the presence of those
who oppose the cardinal virtues of the Knighthood,
to defend the weak, free the oppressed,
and bring relief to the downtrodden.
Now noble nights, remove your boots
for the Anam, Anam,
the Anam what?
- The Anamchara ritual ceremonially
seals the bond between friends.
Everyone look at your candle.
A Knight fights for justice, against injustice.
Never raising his sword for unjust sport or folly.
By our bond we are forever brothers.
- By this act we are soul-bound with respect for each other.
We are Anamchara.
What does Anamchara mean?
- Soul friend.
- Awesome.
- A knight demonstrates unyielding courage
in the face of adversity.
No danger is too great to prevent him
from fulfilling a promise or completing a mission.
Our own flames shine brightly,
but burn hotter together than alone.
- A true Knight chooses the most formidable enemy
as his primary opponent.
He shows mercy to the repentant,
and refuses to inflict undue suffering,
even on the vilest evildoer.
Grant us unity, wisdom, trust
to a lifelong brotherhood.
- To lifelong brotherhood.
- To lifelong brotherhood.
- Manny, Manny, Manny here he comes.
- I see him, calm down.
- Support local business.
- Sign up for local discounts throughout town.
- There's discounts?
- We'll figure it out once we get enough signatures.
- Hey Joe.
- What are you boys doing here?
And what's with the outfits.
- What do you mean?
We're trying to save the grocery store.
Aren't you against the SuperMart?
- When you boys were young,
everyone in this town knew everyone.
You didn't have to hand out stickers.
We worked together, played together.
- And that's why we are trying to bring the town together.
- That's bold.
I'm gonna back you boys, but you need a raccoon in this group
to pull it off to go along
with the dove and the eagle theme.
- It's a griffin.
- A raccoon?
- Yes, 16th smartest animal in the world.
Mischievous, but bold and able to use complex tools.
Support local business.
Support local business.
- Time to go.
- See you guys later.
- Hey Benji. Looking good, Manny.
- Thanks, Julie.
Oh man, I totally blew it.
- Dude she was messing with you, man.
- Oh, you're just jealous that she digs my manhood.
- I wish Jeff saw that.
- Why? So he could kick me?
- No, he wouldn't.
- He would never dare pound Roland like he did me,
and he'd never want to hurt the Jeff-jamin bond.
- That's not true, man.
- Go local!
- Listen, I'll talk to Jeff and I'll set him straight.
- With the fury of a dove?
- Shut up.
- Don't let him ruffle your feathers.
- Ow! This doesn't protect crap.
- You're such a wimp, Manny.
- Shut up, Jeff.
- Lay off, man.
- If I'm such a wimp,
why did Julie just tell me I was hot.
- That's not what she said.
She said you were, "Looking good."
- Same thing.
- What are you doing, boy?
- Nothing, Dad. I'm just taking a break.
- You aren't helping anyone outside.
Get back in here.
- Your stickers are lame, Manny.
- Finally. Now we can begin.
- Wait. One more round.
Let's take this to the next level.
- What do you mean?
- Flame on.
- Are you insane?
- C'mon, it's Dyrnwyn, the sword of Rhydderch Hael.
- Yes, but the sword only blazes with fire for a noble man,
who wields it for a just cause.
- Then I guess it's not gonna work
because we are just pretending, right,
and that's neither noble nor worthy.
- Calm down, Jeff.
- I am calm. I'm just sick of just farting around.
Boys, it's time to go to war.
- With who?
- Anyone!
There's so many boys from Taylor or Lockhart
and I bet you they're down to fight.
- They haven't done anything to us.
- I know that, Manny.
But we could show them that we're the best.
- The best at what?
- At fighting and fencing!
- Stop picking on Manny, man.
Why would we fight with somebody
just to show them how good we are?
- I'm just saying we should take this Order
to the next level.
- If we are attacked, then we fight.
Not off of nothing.
- I'm not saying it's off of nothing!
It's a challenge, it's a duel, it's a competition.
- Well that's something else altogether.
That's different than a battle.
- That's what I meant.
- So what you're saying is that
we should just raise our sword for unjust sport and folly.
All those in favor of accepting this challenge.
Inviting whomsoever wishes to battle us.
Raise their hands.
- Lifelong brotherhood.
- It seemed like the earth swallowed Jeff whole.
Hello, Mr. Minnix, is Jeff around?
- I don't know where he is.
- Well, if you see him could you tell him
I was looking for him?
- Yeah.
- And I-
Hey, Jeff. Jeff, what's up man.
- Hey Jeff, your punk friend is here.
- Hey, you looking at?
- He's not my friend.
- Yeah that's what I thought.
Run kid, we're waiting.
- Yo, Howie, catch.
- Benji the Dove of the Order
of the Red Dragon?
Are you Benji the Dove of the Order of the Red Dragon?
Black Feathers!
- lack Feather! Black Feather!
Black Feather! Black Feather!
Black Feather. Black Feathers.
Black Feathers. Black Feathers.
Black Feathers! Black Feathers!
Black Feathers! Black Feathers!
Black Feathers!
- And that's all it said?
- Well they tried to write on parchment like we do,
but it smeared.
Something about challenging us to a battle
under the next full moon.
- And they said it was from The Order of the Black Feather?
Next full moon? Don't they need time to practice?
- I don't know.
- What if they're totally ripping us off!
- It has to be Jeff.
- How could he do that?
- I don't know but I'm not telling Roland.
- What? Why?
- A true Knight chooses the most formidable enemy
as his primary opponent.
He shows mercy to the repentant,
and refuses to inflict undue suffering,
even on the vilest evildoer.
- Good memory.
- Yeah, we are not gonna let the vilest
of evildoers have the pleasure.
- Hm.
- So you take this and throw yours in the living room,
I'll throw mine in the kitchen.
- Yeah.
- Howie, let's go, let's go.
I can already smell it.
The stink bomb with the gas is gonna make the house smell
all day tomorrow.
- What gas?
- I turned on all the burners on her stove
and just let the gas run.
- What? You idiot!
- What's that alarm?
It's the carbon dioxide detector just stand back.
Come on, come on, wake up.
Odell, Odell, can you hear me?
Odell, Odell, wake up, wake up.
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine. It's okay.
- I, Benji the Dove,
of the Noble Order of the Red Dragon-
- Wake up, wake up, help! - Defender of the weak
and the innocent, did nothing. - Help, help!
- While Howie the Hood, the villain,
the murderer of animals and tormentor of children,
risked his own life for the sake of an old woman
who was his archenemy.
Hi, Miss Odell.
- Boys.
- How ya feeling?
- Throat hurts.
- Yeah, well they put one
of those respiratory things down your throat.
- Nah, it's probably just her yelling at all the doctors.
You look great.
- You know when you're getting out of here?
- There may be a bit of a problem.
- What are you talking about?
- When the Fire Marshall went through the house
to check on the carbon whatever levels
he ended up finding quite a bit of mold.
- Like in the fridge?
- No, silly.
Black mold in all through the house.
He said it wasn't safe for me to live there
unless I get someone to tear out the walls
and get rid of all that mold.
- I'm sorry that we couldn't stop it.
And about Socrates.
But we will get them back.
- You mustn't blame yourself for any of this
and I don't want any revenge.
- But you could've died.
- How long will these flowers last?
- Longer than the balloons if you keep them in water.
Manny, feel free to take a rose to Julie.
Okay, boys, it's time to go.
- Bye, Miss Odell.
- Bye.
- There has to be a way for us to help Ms. Odell.
- Like what?
- Fight.
- What's this?
Full moon? The Order of the Black Feather?
When did you get this?
- The day before.
- And why didn't you say anything?
- Well, I don't know.
I just felt a true Knight wouldn't give them the pleasure.
But now, now I feel we should go and kick them.
- No. You were right.
This is a different kind of fight,
a true challenge for the Order.
What does Miss Odell need?
- What if we took up a collection for her?
- She needs a house.
- We could build a house!
- Yeah, yeah but that could take loads of money.
- True.
A whole house! That could take years!
- Yes, but if we just begin,
who knows what will come our way!
We must! We will!
- Yeah, money, cash money. Donations!
- To Operation Resurrection!
Are you sure we shouldn't just fight tonight?
Are we cowards?
- I don't think we are.
- I'm sure they were a part of 
what happened to Miss Odell.
- If we are for justice,
and against injustice, shouldn't we-
- Let's take a vote.
- All those in favor of accepting the challenge
of the Order of the Black Feather, 
raise your hand.
- They're not coming.
- I knew they were scared.
- What do you expect? 
They're a bunch of dumb kids.
- You nervous?
- No. Just burning to death in this mask.
- We've been waiting over an hour!
- Yeah, I told you, they're afraid!
You said they would come, man.
- Maybe they can't read.
- They read the notes, all right.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
- I was really in the mood for a fight!
- Yeah, save it.
All right, they'll come next time. 
I'll make sure of it.
- So Eddie have you seen 
Howie in the hospital yet?
I was going- - Screw him man.
All right he punked out in the end didn't he?
We don't need him, right? That's right.
And you carry my shield, Jeff.
- Do you really think we did the right thing?
- Sometimes the most courageous thing
to do is not fight.
They are not our adversary.
Besides we now have a more noble quest.
There is no need to battle
just for the sake of coming to blows.
- Yeah, I wonder who'd want to do that?
- Excuse me ma'am.
- Oh, what do we have here? 
Pirate treasure?
- We'd like to open an account.
- Mr. Grant!
- Careful folks, looks like 
we're about to get robbed
by a pack of pirates!
- We're knights not pirates.
- Okay, if you boys wouldn't mind taking
your toys outside that would be great.
- Well as you can see, we need to open an account
so we can build a house for Ms. Odell.
- Susan, why don't you count this out
for our new customers and push my meeting.
- You don't have any meeting.
- Good. Excellent.
Good work you're hired. Fired.
Gentlemen, this way please.
Hey, I use to collect coins.
- Rest up.
It doesn't have to be as big as her old house.
- But she needs a garden and a new porch.
She definitely needs that.
- I appreciate your boys' benevolence
and go-for-it attitude.
I was only interested in comics
and girls when I was your age.
- We like those, too.
- Okay. Here you go boys.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Ma'am.
Keep this up and you'll have enough
for a building loan in the year 2034.
- So you've raised a good chunk of change
but houses here cost a lot of money.
- Well, we can raise more.
We're dedicated to doing all that we can,
working together that is.
- That's noble.
An alternative option would be 
to renovate the house.
Make it like new.
But you need cheap labor and lumber to pull this off.
Don't look so glum.
If you knights can raise more money
maybe get some donations,
I know some folks who may be interested
in helping with the labor.
I think that is a real solution to help Miss Odell.
- As a knight of the Order of the Dragon,
I vow to raise enough money
to build a new house for Miss Odell.
- Well then I vow to make Miss Odell's house
look like new again.
Nice meeting you. Have a good knight.
Hey I was a ninja myself.
- What? - Oh yeah, ninja.
Back when I was your age,
me and my friends were ninjas and samurais.
You know what. Mind if I?
Oh yeah, stretch it out. Stretch it.
- Oh yeah.
- Gotta be looking at me.
Roland you never know.
Ya know, ya never know what she likes.
- Yeah, Roland you need some help back there?
- Yeah.
- Did you guys raise enough money?
- Are you spying on us?
- No, I was just looking for you guys,
to see how it's going.
- You know that all matters
of the Order are strictly confidential.
- Yeah, I just wanted to come see you guys
and give you something.
- But you resigned from the Order.
- Yeah, you wanted out.
- I just wanted to talk to you guys
for a minute, that's all.
- About what?
- About whether I could join up again.
- But weren't you part of what happened to Miss Odell?
To Socrates?
- I wasn't there. I had nothing to do with that.
- But you know who did?
- I don't know anything about it, okay!
- And what about the full moon fight?
- You punks should have shown up,
it was just a battle challenge.
- So you are a Black Feather.
- All those in favor of reinstating Jeff
into the Order, raise their hands.
- Screw you, guys.
- What kind of mess is gonna be in this bag?
It's always something.
Is he gonna lie again?
- I know you're pretending to be asleep.
I want to see you
to thank you.
- For what?
- Oh, for saving my life.
- I'm sorry I killed your cat.
- Yes, I know.
You took his life, but you gave mine back to me.
So, in a way, we could say we're even.
- Even?
- I know there's a reason for everything,
a reason you had to do what you did.
No matter what and I don't blame you for it.
- You don't?
- No.
I know what it's like not to be loved.
I know how far one will go to get the attention one needs.
There's a song I know, I love it.
It speaks to me and always gives me peace no matter what.
♪ Left a good job in the city ♪
♪ Working for the man every night and day ♪
♪ Never lost a minutes sleep thinking about ♪
♪ What could of been ♪
♪ Big wheels keep on turning ♪
♪ Proud Mary keeps on burning ♪
♪ Rollin' ♪
I'm surprised you know that song.
- I got a radio and only two stations work.
And old lady music is one of them.
- Do you think they know what's coming?
- They don't know what's about to hit them.
- Let's do this.
...
...
- Nice job, kids.
- Who is that?
- That's Mr. Scrubb.
- A hundred bucks! He gave us a hundred bucks.
- 100 though.
Could have been anything else but he gave you a 100.
- Great job, boys.
I do indeed believe we have enough
to make Miss Odell's house look like new.
I wish I had this energy and drive at your age.
You pulled the community together
to do a good thing and everyone noticed.
Even Mr. Scrubb, without his labor donations
this might not have been possible.
- Mr. Scrubb? But that's the Stupid SuperMart dude.
- Hey, he gave us a hundred bucks.
- And he says he'll donate all the labor?
- 100%.
- That's a pretty sweet deal.
- What do you think, Benjamin?
- Well, this is for Miss Odell, so I'll say yes.
- I'll make a call
and we'll start the renovations immediately.
Congratulations, guys, now get back to school.
- How's Howie doing?
- He's fine.
- Should we pay him a visit before we leave?
- That would be difficult, he's gone.
- Gone? - Yeah.
- You mean he just left?
- Um.
- You know, I think he's homeless.
- Ah.
Well then that would make sense.
He's had a hard go of it, that boy.
I guess he's just as able
to take care of himself now as he ever was.
Lord knows he's had enough practice.
- Thank you!
- They're coming! - Oh! Guys, let's go!
- Get ready, get ready, they're coming.
...
- Welcome home!
- How in the world.
- This is from all of us to you.
- I can't believe it.
- Okay let's party.
- Yes, yes.
- Right, left, right, left, right.
- So this is a two step?
- I don't even know what that is.
- Right, left, they don't want us to.
- Hey Manny, do you wanna dance?
- Have you seen Manny?
- Nah, not since Julie made 
all his dreams come true.
- I'm sure he's picking out a fresh rose.
We did a courageous thing here Benji the Dove. 
A good thing.
- It does seem just. It does seem just.
- Man, this place looks like new.
- How are you?
- I'm doing better, Benji.
- Well we tried to come visit you at the hospital but-
- But I took up all your time.
Hello, Howard. How are you?
You boys run along,
Howard and I have some catching up to do.
- It's good to see you, Howie.
- It's good to be seen, Benji.
Okay, I know. I know.
- Oh, my, my, my, my, my.
- Look at her. Oh big old thing.
- Oh, my, my, my.
- She's a rescue.
- I hate dogs so, so much.
- Your house looks amazing.
- It is indeed, I'm still taking it all in.
So what's next for you?
- I don't know.
But I'll figure it out,
I'll get a job somewhere or something.
I can take care of myself.
- Oh, I don't doubt that for a minute,
but where will you stay in the meantime?
You're welcome to live here, if you'd like.
You could stay in the living room.
You would have it entirely to yourself.
- I mean look.
- And you can stay here 
as long as it suits you.
Help me take care of little Augustina here.
- That's a horrible name.
- Do you like that? You like it Augustina?
Pretty horrible, huh?
- He should have been there yesterday.
- Perhaps he was. In spirit that is.
- Jeff doesn't do spirit.
- Well, Jeff doesn't do 
a lot of things, does he?
Like stick around in the Order, 
like fight fair.
- What the hell?
- There's something written
on the back of this one.
- "We have Mister Chivalry the Wimp.
He will be our prisoner until you show up
and fight to set him free.
The Black Feather awaits 
your arrival at the lake
at one p.m. sharp.
If you dare."
- This has gone on too far. This ends now.
- Keep it up.
Keep it up, we're not going to let a bunch
of 10 year olds beat us.
Keep it going.
- Can I keep this off till they come.
- No! Yo what time is it?
- How the hell should I know.
- Hey! Watch it.
- Roland's all talk. He won't fight for anger.
And Benjamin is strong but will give in to-
- To what?
- Manny are you okay?
- Yeah, my feet are a little wet though.
- Eddie the Turd!
- Don't call me that!
- You all have gone too far!
- Are you ready to fight, Highlander,
you and your little sidekick here?
- Two against four
that doesn't seem like a fair fight to me,
but maybe you're all 
just too scared to fight fairly.
- Oh no, oh we're trembling boys,
 aren't we?
Get ready, men!
- Untie Manny first!
- He's fine.
- I said untie him!
- Benji! Hey!
- Is that a real sword?
- There's only one way to find out.
- Screw this, man. - Let's go.
- Are you okay?
- Get up Highlander get up.
- Eddie, that's enough. 
I said, that's enough!
- Come on is that all you got?
- What're you going to do now huh? Kill us?
- Maybe.
Know what, I used to be afraid of you.
Afraid of getting hurt. But no more.
Because you know what I realized
that there's nothing scarier 
than having no friends.
Well look around.
You're alone.
And you couldn't look any more scared.
- Guys, I'm drifting!
- Grab the rope!
Benji. - Wait, Benji.
- Benji!
- Manny!
Manny where are you?
Manny!
Manny, you all right? - It's all right.
- Manny!
Manny!
Manny!
- Jeff the Tiger.
- Roland the Dragon.
- Manny, Manny the Griffin.
- When your son came in he was not responsive.
And we tried multiple times to resuscitate him.
We did everything we could.
I'm sorry to tell you that he is expired.
- Oh my god.
- Roland once said the Ancient Celts believed
the voice of the Dove was a mourning call.
When its cry was heard,
it indicated a soul was passing 
from the earth in peace.
Manny thought this place was the best.
The river all to ourselves.
The cliff swallows above our heads,
the story of old sailors, stupid jokes,
ridiculously low voices, funny accents
and the sound of our own laughter.
Good times with the best of friends.
The sun high above 
and not a care in the world,
This was the entrance to paradise.
- A year doesn't take away the pain, does it Benji?
- Not really.
- Knowing he's in a 
better place is some comfort,
but I know you miss your friend.
- I do.
- When you get to be my age,
you have a lot of friends up there.
I'm sorry you lost a dear friend so early.
Our lives are better because Manny lived.
- Blackburian Warbler.
- Rare?
- Common.
Common and beautiful 
if you take the time to see them.
You think all this will be okay, right?
- My favorite author once said,
"If I find in myself a desire
for which no experience
in this world can satisfy,
the most probable conclusion is that
I was made for another world."
I'm gonna leave the two 
of you alone for a minute.
- It doesn't get any better than this, 
does it Benji?
- Nope.
- The Mighty Griffin. 
King of all beasts and birds and fish.
- This is our town.
It's just a couple of streets, a park and a lake,
our little world all of its own.
It's the kind of town where nobody moves out,
almost nobody moves in 
and no one is ever forgotten.
