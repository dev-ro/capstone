But you did see him?

I asked myself for a moment  
to take him.
Why?

When she's better, I can go back to work.
Where? When? As if they are going to wait for you.

I don't know...
Where do you live?
In the Molinaystreet.
Upstairs or downstairs?
- Downstairs.
Tomorrow I'm going to the sawmill,
to get some wood.
You can come if you like, so you can 
learn about the different types of wood.
Ok.
The others have already went.
That way you'll catch up with them.
Here it is, right before that pizzeria.
There it is.
Tomorrow I'll pick you up at 9.
Thanks, see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
What kind of tree was that?
No idea.
How did you know it was 120 years old?
By the circles inside the tree trunk.
They call them year rings.
Who thaught you that?
A boy I met in Fraipont.
How old were you 
when you went to Fraipont?
Eleven, I think.
Don't you remember when they locked you up?
- I do.
So why do you say: "I think?"
It's been a long time.
What kind of trees are those?
Where?
- That big one over there.
Beech trees.
A hard kind of wood.
Yes. To make trees and furniture.
Also handgrips for tools,      
because it's smoother for your hands.
There was a rabbit.
I fell asleep.
Didn't sleep well?
Yes, but I take sleeping pills.
Is it far yet?
40 kilometers.
What did you do to get to Fraipont
when you were 11?
Yes?
What did you do to get to Fraipont
when you were 11?
Something stupid.
- Something what?
A theft.
Did they lock you up for a theft?
Yes. And some other things.
Can I sleep in the back?
Yes.
Aren't you hungry?
Are we there?
- No. Aren't you hungry?
Yeah, I want something.
An apple turnover, please.
- Yes.
Me too.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Together?
- No.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
40 francs, please.    
- Goodbye.
Hello, sir.
Would you like to be my guardian?
Haven't you got one already?
No.
Please.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
And your social worker?
You have to ask him.
That's not the same.
He's from Fraipont. 
I'd rather have some outsider.
Are you ok with it?
I don't know, I have to think about it.
Shall we play some pingpong?
Why do you want me to be your guardian?
Because you teach me my job.
Shall we start?
The scoreboard.
Can I call you Olivier?
Why?
Because the others call u Olivier.
If you like that.
What else exept the theft?
There was someone killed.
Did you kill someone?
Yes.
I was a champion in Fraipont.
Can I have another?
I'll give them back monday.
Thanks.
Are we there yet?
No. Two, three kilometres.
Why did you kill someone?
You want me to be your guardian,
I have to right to know.
What did you stole?
A car stereo.
Did you kill someone for that stereo?
There was a boy in the back I
didn't see.
He didn't want to let me go.
I grabbed him by the neck till he let go.
You strangled him...
He didn't want to let me go.
- You strangled him...
I didn't want to, but I was afraid
they would catch me.
You did, otherwise he wouldn't be dead.
Yes but...
- No buts. Did you do it or not?
Well, yes.
I drove too far.
Do you regret what you have done?
Ofcourse.
Why ofcourse?
I was locked away for 5 years,
you regret that.
I'm gonna pee. Be right back.
Do you have the key?
We are here with my brother.
Why is this between the boards?   
- What?
Those blocks of wood?
To keep space for air to run to it
That's for the wood to dry.
If you make a door with boards who
haven't been dryed...
They shrink.
Yes. Than there are gaps between the boards.
What's that?
Pitch pine.
- Which one?
Look in your manual.
Oregon.
Yes. That's a region in America.
Is that a soft or a hard kind of wood?
Without looking in your book.
Soft.
Yes. Just feel it.
Go throught it with your nails.
Can you feel it?
The second bunch from below,
and the top ones, what is that?
Also pine pitch.
Which?
Look at the veins of the wood.
Carolina pitch pine.
Yes. From Canada.
We take from those 2 boards and 2 oregon.
Stay there.
You got them?
- Yes.
Let them come down on the floor.
Balanced on your shoulder.
5 m 80.
5 m 80 divided by 2?
2 metres 90.
That boy you killed
was my son.
Don't be afraid. Come back.
Come back.
Wait! Wait!
I saw you, come down!
I saw you, come down.
Come, I won't do you harm.
- I don't believe you.
Come down!
Come down!          
I just want to talk to you.
Come down! Leave that.
I've been locked up for 5 years.
I payed my debt.
Leave that! Put it down! Leave that!
