Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.
Could I have a room
for the night, please?
Single?
Yes, please,
with bath, if possible.
Okay, that'll be fine.
If you'd just like to fill in
this form- name and address.
Thank you.
Gentleman's
an old client.
We haven't seen you
down here for years.
Years have gone by since then.
Do you remember me?
I'm sorry, no.
I'm positive I have
seen you here before.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
I'm sorry. I must have
confused you with someone else.
I'll show you
to your room.
Thank you.
Do you have some luggage?
No, none.
[Footsteps]
[Floor Creaking]
It's getting dark already.
Take a look at the map, will you,
see where we are.
Did you see that woman?
There were two.
I only saw one.
Yeah, there was another one.
She was hiding
behind the trees.
Really?
Sure, she was hiding.
Perhaps you're seeing things.
No. I'm sure.
Well, if they are hitchhikers
someone's bound to give them a lift.
Could you give me a lift?
It's not very far.
[Man]
Sure. Hop in.
Thanks very much.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Well, we've certainly
covered a good distance
in the last few days.
Yes, we have.
What's the matter?
Me? Nothing.
You look worried.
Have you noticed
that house over there?
Yeah. Looks abandoned.
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
This place frightens me.
It's not the first time
we've camped in the woods.
[Grunts]
And we're both tired.
Perhaps.
You'll be more cheerful
after a night's sleep.
I think I'll go down to the lake tomorrow,
see if there’s any fish.
Why should one of them
be hiding behind a tree?
What?
Why should one of them
be hiding behind a tree?
I didn't see anyone hiding.
Well, I did.
One woman stood
on the edge of the road.
The other one was hiding in the woods,
watching for something.
Perhaps just waiting.
Perhaps she was waiting
whilst her friend stopped the car.
[Owl Hooting]
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
There's somebody in that house.
I just saw a light move
in one of the windows.
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
[Man Screaming]
[Screaming]
John! John!
What on earth's the matter?
There's somebody outside!
What? What do you mean?
I saw a big hand
right there on the window.
At this time of night
and in this weather
nobody's gonna be outside.
You must have
been dreaming.
No.
First of all, I heard a scream.
It woke me up.
Then when I was awake
I suddenly saw this horrible hand outside.
[Scoffs]
Oh, come on, darling.
Let's go back to sleep.
Sleep?
You don't honestly think
I can get any sleep now, do you?
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
[Rain Falling]
[Door Opens, Closes]
There's no one out there,
Harriet darling, so relax.
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
You've got to convince yourself
that you were dreaming.
[Sighs]
[Bell Tolling]
[Bell Continues Tolling]
[Siren Wailing]
You're late!
It was the chiming of the church clock
that woke me.
Then I saw them pass by-
the same two women
that were close to the road yesterday.
A coincidence.
Yes, but it was them.
They were walking quickly,
one behind the other.
Well, perhaps they live
somewhere close by.
Even so, what on earth were they doing
at that hour of the morning?
They didn't look normal.
No? Well, what did
they look like then?
Can't explain exactly,
but they gave me
a very strange feeling.
Since we arrived at this spot
everything's seemed strange to you.
You see hands and ghosts
just about everywhere.
[No Audible Dialogue]
You're not
the usual kind of hitchhiker.
What's your name?
Fran.
Fran? Like Frances?
No, just Fran.
My name's Ted.
What are you doing on the road
at this time of evening?
I decided to take a stroll
and then realized it was getting late.
I don't live far from here.
You remind me very much of someone
I knew a long time ago.
Yes, very much indeed.
Slow down.
We're almost there.
It's the next on the left.
Are you sure that this track
is meant for cars?
It's a short cut.
It's not often used.
- Are you English?
- What makes you ask?
You don't look English.
Hmm.
Well, what are you then?
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.
Try me.
[Engine Off]
Hey, John, look.
Hmm?
It's one of those women
with a man.
Oh, again?
That's his car,
if you need convincing.
I don't need convincing.
I just don't see anything
peculiar about it, that's all.
Ah.
[Door Opens]
[Hinges Creak]
Does this kind of thing
excite you?
Sometimes.
Why?
Now, don't be too impatient.
Come.
I get the impression
that you're not too keen
on this kind of expedition.
Don't worry.
Now listen here.
I find you very attractive,
but this stroll is becoming rather boring.
What the hell is this all about?
You can't tell me
that you use this place
for your dates.
Certainly not.
But where we're going
is quite different from all this,
and it's too late to go back now.
Well, I mean it would be a shame to
retrace our steps after having arrived so far.
And we are nearly there.
This is my place.
Do you like it?
Well, it's better
than the rest of the house.
Can't believe it.
Does it all belong to you?
I'm only a guest.
What other surprises
have you got for me?
We'll see.
Now, be a darling and light the fire
while I get us something to drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Relax. The worst's over.
[Footsteps]
[Door Opens]
[Footsteps]
I was asking myself-
Asking?
Well, I don't pretend
that you should divulge
all your secrets, but-
Go on. Ask.
Is there a limit
to the questions?
There's a limit to the answers.
Do you, uh, live here alone?
I often receive guests.
What do you do for a living?
I'm searching all the time.
Searching for interesting people.
It's difficult to find
really interesting people.
I know, but I keep searching.
I know how to fend for myself.
I feel happier here
than anywhere else.
These walls
have become my friends,
my confidantes.
You're not easy to understand.
That's the way
I have to be accepted,
with no questions
and no explanations.
This is my lucky day.
Don't ever say that.
Never mind.
I don't mind unusual situations.
They come on their own.
Like our meeting
on the road today.
Are you sure we're alone?
What makes you ask?
I get the strong feeling
we're not.

[Inhales Sharply]
Hey!
Who's there?
Fran?

[Knob Rattling]
Where the bloody hell
do people go here in the mornings?
[Engine Starts]
[Emergency Brake Sets]
[Engine Off]
Excuse me for intruding,
but I've hurt myself.
Yeah, of course.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Uh, sit down.
Thanks.
It's nothing serious.
Just one moment.
It's only a little cut,
but it hurts a bit.
That's quite a deep cut.
Did it on a piece of glass.
Well, I must have had
a few too many last night...
and fallen over
a broken glass.
Yeah, that's pretty swollen.
First I'll disinfect it.
Sorry.
It's all right. Carry on.
Yeah, it might hurt,
but it helps.
Thanks for your help.
Why, don't mention it.
With my arm in this state
I couldn't have driven very far.
You know,
you ought to rest for a while.
Well, I feel fine now.
You sure?
How about stay with us
and have a cup of coffee?
Oh, no. No, thanks.
She's right, you know.
Hot cup of coffee'll do you good.
Well, that's very kind of you.
Thank you very much.
Have you got
the correct time, please?
Um, 10:15.
It's ridiculous,
but my watch stopped.
It's never done it before.
Well, I'd best be
on my way.
Many thanks for the coffee
and your help.
That's okay.
Does anyone live
in that house?
That's a question
I asked myself earlier,
and I still haven't
found an answer.
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Hey.
[Chuckles]
[Engine Starts]
The urge was too strong.
You had to ask him...
or you would have exploded.
Mmm. But he didn't
answer my question, did he?
No.
Look.
He's going back to the house.
Yeah. Yeah, I can see.
He's going back to the house.
[Thunder Rumbling]
I'm sorry about this morning.
I had to get up at the crack of dawn,
and I couldn't get back any earlier.
I had so much to do.
Will you forgive me?
Oh, not to worry.
You're here now.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I'm not alone. I'm with friends.
I'm sure you'll like them.
That's Miriam and her friend.
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
Oh, it's freezing in here.
Well, I'll have this alight
in a jiffy.
Do you like that?
Mmm.
Look, may I make
a phone call?
Afraid not.
Hmm?
There's no telephone
in the house.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
It’s just that I'd arranged
to meet some friends of mine.
I would liked to have let them know
I was going to be a bit late.
Oh, I feel so guilty.
It's okay.
[Miriam]
Can I give you a hand, darling?
No, thanks. It's okay.
I'm afraid
it's all we've got to offer.
Red wine.
But a very good vintage.
[Liquid Splashes]
Oh.
Thanks.
Good health.
Do you like it?
Mmm.
Everyone
seems to like it.
The cellars here
are stacked high
with the stuff.
Some of it
must be years old.
Really?
Have a drop more.
Mmm, thanks.
Miriam, darling,
I'm afraid you'll have to go down
to the cellar to fetch some more.
I'm sure Rupert will be able to help you
in the choice of an excellent vintage.
- Mmm. with pleasure.
- Let's go then.
I waited for you all day
until I fell asleep in the car.
Forgive me about this morning.
I thought I'd be back earlier.
This girl- your friend.
- Miriam?
- Yes.
Was she here last night?
No. I told you, we were alone.
Just you and I.
But-
Does she live here with you?
More or less.
She's my girlfriend.
We have a lot in common,
get on very well together.
But it's crazy to live
in an old place like this.
No telephone,
the place almost in ruins.
These walls could fall in on you
any moment.
Who is this chap Rupert?
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
A very nice man.
How long have you known him?
Since this afternoon.
He gave us a lift here.
May have chosen
a bad spot for camping.
I don't see why.
It's attractive and quiet
and nobody's bothered us.
That's not the point.
How often do you read
of horrible things happening
in just such a situation?
Quiet, isolated corner,
couple like us-
Oh, darling, please.
Don't start all that again.
First there were those two women.
Then that man with the cut on his arm.
Well, now
you're exaggerating.
Poor man came in search of help,
which is perfectly natural.
You cut yourself
and the first thing you do
is look for help. Logical, no?
Well, when I asked him
if anyone lived in the house or not,
he avoided a proper reply.
Well, not exactly.
He implied in a very friendly manner
that you shouldn't stick your nose
into other people's affairs.
I find that
perfectly reasonable.
That's not the point.
He said he didn't know
if the place was inhabited or not,
and then
he spends his nights there.
Now, why?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Because he probably has
a wonderful time with that woman.
Or the two women,
the ones you're so concerned about.
Perhaps they live in the house.
Perhaps he lives there himself.
Well, somebody does.
How should I know?
Oh, Harriet!
No normal person
would live in a place like that.
No?
No.
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]
You arouse me more than any woman
I've met for a long time.
Thanks for the compliment.
No, no, I'm dead serious, Fran.
You intrigue me
and you worry me...
because I don't understand you.
Don't try to.
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Thunderclap]
[Gasping]
[Groaning]
[Panting]
You're playing
a dangerous game.
Kill him before it's too late.
Kill him. Kill him!

By this sign,
I'll recognize you.
[Ted]
Hey!
Open up! who's there?
Fran?
Open the door for me!
Fran!
Is anybody there?
Is that you, Fran?
[Fran]
Yes. What's happened?
The wind blew the door shut,
and the handle has fallen out.
[Rattling]
[Hinges Creak]
What on earth
made you come down here?
I was looking for you.
Are you all right?
I've been locked down here
the whole bloody day.
Do you know
that your friend Rupert,
who was here last night,
is dead?
Dead?
Yeah.
I saw his car
on the main road this morning.
He didn't look too fit
as he left last night.
I told him
to drive carefully.
He'd had too much
to drink.
That's terrible.
Poor Rupert.
Yeah.
And now I'd like to get out
of this damn cellar
just as soon as possible.
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.
Yeah.
Let's go.
And what's more,
there's a few things I'd like
you to explain to me.

[Hinges Creaking]
[Creaking]
[Water Dripping]
[Squeaking]
- [Screams]
- Have you gone quite mad?
Oh, thank God it's you.
What are you doing here?
I might ask you the same.
What the bloody hell do you think
you're doing in this house
when it doesn't belong to you?
I've seen them down there.
They spend their days asleep
in the cellar.
Let's get out immediately.
It's the truth, John.
I tell you.
Those two women are down there
like living dead.
When you didn't return
and time was getting on,
I imagined you'd be sticking your nose
in somewhere or other
that you shouldn't be.
You're impossible.
[Weak Groaning]
He- He-
[Panting]
[Exhales]
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Thunderclap]
[Tires Screeching]
Can you give us a lift?
It's not far.
Why, y-yes, of course.
Thanks.
Fran! Fran!
[Panting]
[Goblet Falls On Floor]
[Thunderclap]
[Footsteps]
Who's there?
Outside.
I hear voices.
Met him. Picked him up.
On the roadside, no doubt.
Just like Rupert.
Just like me.
[Thunderclap]
Who are you?
Where the hell do you come from?
I must get away from here.
I must get away from here!
Would you like a drink?
Yes, very much indeed.
Good. Just a second.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Say when.
Wh- That's plenty.
Thank you. [Chuckling]
[Ted]
Fran!
Oh, that's Fran's boyfriend.
This always happens
when he drinks too much.
Oh. Really.
Poor chap.
Better luck next time.
Yes. Cheers.
Cheers.
Mmm.
This is excellent.
It's one of the best wines
I've ever tasted.
Good. Have some more.
Thank you.
It's a vintage of our own.
My friend and I
are rather proud of it.
And yet I could tell you
everything you wanted
to know about this wine.
Oh, yes?
I don't believe you.
[Chuckling]
My dear young lady,
you are sitting in front
of a true connoisseur.
[Chuckles]
Now, wait and-
First, I'll tell you
the country of origin.
Shouldn't be
too difficult to judge.
You'll never guess.
I'll bet you anything you like.
Don't be too sure.
I'm an expert.
And I've recognized
some very obscure wines
in my time.
Well, let's see
how you manage this time.
All right. Fine.
Just a moment.
Mmm. It's a claret.
Yes, but that's obvious-
No, no. wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
It's, uh-
Comes from a small vineyard.
Mmm. Mmm.
Well matured.
Go on.
Mmm.
Very well matured.
Indeed.
Positive and yet-
No, no, no. It's too light.
It's definitely not a St-Emilion
or a Gravet.
It's, uh-
Mmm! It's a Medoc.
And therefore,
it must be a Margaux.
[Both Chuckling]
No? Uh-
[Fran]
No.
Pauillac.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's too, uh-
Too highly scented,
too feminine to be a Pauillac.
It's- It's-
I've tasted this wine
in the Saint Julien region.
Yes. It's a Saint Julien.
Sorry to disappoint you,
but you're wrong.
This wine comes
from a remote part
of the Carpathian Mountains.
The Carpathians?
[Fran]
Yes. That's right.
Lucky you didn't
have a bet on it.
Well, anyway, it's excellent.
[Both Chuckling]
What a pity your friend
isn't here to appreciate it.
Cheers.
[Fran]
Cheers.
[Panting, Gasps]
[Footsteps Approaching]
[Exhales]
[Thunderclap]
[Laughter]
Well, you've certainly
got a good stock.
[Blows]
Now, that's a beautiful wine.
Oh, I have a much better one
than that to show you.
What, really?
Better than this?
Yes. Much better.
[Blows]
Well, that's fantastic.
You know, this wine
is nearly 15 years old.
That really is
the sort of wine I appreciate.
[Miriam Chuckling]
When I tell the chaps about this,
they just won't believe it.
An isolated house in the woods,
at the witching hour
of midnight,
[Cork Squeaking]
in a cellar full
of this marvelous wine,
and above all else,
in the company of two
very charming ladies.
It's almost too good to be true.
Nothing's too good to be true.
The only trouble is,
life's too short.
[Both Chuckling]
[Laughing Continues]
Ooh, whoop!
[Wine Pouring]
And for you.
Well, that's strange.
what?
My watch has stopped. Look.
Huh.
That's never happened before.
[Chuckling]
[Screaming]
[Gasping, Groaning]

[Growling]
- No!
- [Shouts]
Stop!

[Grunting]
[Running Footsteps]

[Labored Breathing]
Help! Help!
He looks in
pretty poor shape, John.
What should we do?
Uh, here.
Yes.
I think we ought to
get him to a hospital.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
We'll-
I'll start the car,
you stop here
and look after him.
[Grunts, Gasps]

John! John!
[Ferocious Screaming]

No! No!
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
No! No! No!
No, get off!
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!
[Screams]
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
No! No!
[Shouting]
[Gasping]
No!
[Screaming]
[Bell Tolling]
[Labored Breathing]
[Gasping]
But we can't let him
get away alive.
We must go now.
We must go now, Fran!
[Gasping]
Hey there! Hey! Listen!
This is private property,
and you shouldn't be parked here.
Didn't you read the notice
on the road back there?
Eh? what?
Now, come on. wake up!
Be thankful I don't run you in.
Drinking and trespass.
And next time,
go and drink your wine
somewhere else.
It's always the same old story.
No, wait a minute. Let me explain.
I'm not interested in your explanations.
Now, the best thing you can do
is to move off.
I've work to do,
and your presence here
is not an answer.
The price being asked
for the house is cheap,
for the amount of land it stands on.
[Man]
Is there any truth in the legend
they tell about this old house?
Well, it seems
that some years ago...
the bodies of two young,
unidentified women were found.
A sad story that hasn't helped
selling the house.
You know
how superstitious people are.
The murderer always returns
to the scene of his crime...
while the ghosts
of these two poor women
haunt the building.
It's ridiculous.
One can't believe in such things
nowadays, can one?
Look. my wife and I
would be thrilled at the idea
of having a ghost in the place.
Just imagine
informal weekends here.
[Woman]
Oh, darling,
isn't that fascinating?
We just can't miss
this opportunity.
