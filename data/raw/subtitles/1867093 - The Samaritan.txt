I thought that we would go out,

Have a drink.
I guess I was just trying to
show you that I'm like my dad.
But the truth is,
I never really knew the guy,
You know, my mom, she was-
- What do you want from me,
Ethan?
- I want to know
why you killed my father.
Still a lot of money
to be made down there.
- Just how much do you know
about me and your dad?
- Only what my mom told me,
that you were best friends,
partners.
- She tell you what we did?
Our work'?
. No.
But I figured it out.
It's everything I could find.
Every article, every picture.
- Why would you keep all this?
- How else
could I get to know him?
You were grifters,
best in the city, according
to a lot of the old-timers.

you need to let this go.
Your dad's been dead
a long time.
- No, I need to know.
Foley,
put yourself in my shoes.

We were on the grift-
a long con
with a volatile mark
but with a high yield
if it played.
And it played.
Till your dad got greedy
and tried to squeeze the mark
loo hard,
I never figured out why.
- He was in debt.
He was way over his head,
Cards, horses.
Took my mom years
to get out from under it.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
Mark was a heavy hitter.
Didn't take well
to being ripped off.
Gave me a choice:
kill your dad,
or I could die with him.

thinking about
the choices I made that night.
I was young,
younger than you are now,
but I made a choice.
I never broke frame,
and I was punished for it.
- What was his name?
The mark'
- What's it matter?
He was the mark.
Your dad put us both
in a corner,
and there was only one way out
- Well, if somebody
did that to me,
I'd kill him too.
I'm just saying...
I understand.
- You understand?
- Yeah, I do,
and I think we can help
each other.
- Look at me, Ethan.
25 years of my life

You know, my mom was alone
for a long time.
But when I'm 17,
she brings home this new guy,
and he takes us out to dinner,
orders me a steak,
so I know that he sees me
as a man, not a boy,
and they tell me
they're getting married.
What am I supposed to say
to that'?
Well, sure, I'd love a dad
who owns a shitty body shop
and smells of urinal cakes.
So I eat my steak,
and I go to work.
Late night calls
to the same number

Motel room charges

I don'! have any friends.
I don't have anything'
Not one goddamn thing'
- Yeah.
Me too, pretty much.
Both of my parents died
when I was too little
to remember them.
I was raised by my alcoholic
douche bag grandma
till I could get out
from under her thumb.
Basically, anyone who ever
cared about me is dead.
Only reason
my grandma is still alive
is probably 'cause
I hate her guts.

- Oh, you think that's funny?
- Just a bit.
- Well,

giving you a pity fuck.

Right about now,
Jake is sitting in a car
outside of Iris' apartment,
and if I don't call him

he's gonna go upstairs,
fuck her,
and cave her head in

Or maybe he'll cave her head in

what?
Forgive you

you're gonna pay your debt.

- Ethan, listen to me-
- No, you listen to me!
I have got a mark
primed and ready to go,
but he does things old-school,
so I need someone old-school
to help me take his money.
- You don't want my help.
You want to get me back

I'm sorry.

[coughs and gasps]
[groans]
[grunting and groaning]
- You disappear for a week.
Not a fucking word to
let me know you're even alive,
but you're sorry?
- I spent half my life
in prison.
In there, the decisions
are made for you.
All this out here?
It's new to me.
I got things to sort out.
And in order to do that,
I need time.
Time-
[sighs]
Time away from all this.
Time...
away from you'
- You're lying.
[snifﬂes]
We said no lies.
- Iris-
- I know when you're lying'
So you might as well
just tell me the truth.
- That is the truth.
You have to trust me.
Look, we can't see each other
right now.
It'd be best if you left
I can'! tell you why.
[sighs]
Look, if I didn't have to,
I wouldn't ask.
- You want me to trust you,
but you won't even trust me
with the truth?
- If I told you
it was for your own protection,
you would just tell me
you could protect yourself.
- I can.
- I know.
And I know you can see through
any story I tell you.
You're supposed to be
the one person
I can always tell the truth'
But I can't.
And I'm asking you again-
please, trust me.
- Let's just get out of here'
We'll go somewhere hot,
with beaches
and fat tourists to rip off.
I'll plan every detail.
All you have to do
is say yes,
- I have money I can give you,
Just take it
and go as far away as you can.
Don'! tell me where.
- How long'?
- A few weeks.
A month, maybe.
- Or longer?
Or never'?
- No, no, baby,
not never.
. [cries]
- Iris.
[melancholy piano music]
J'-I'
Look, I need your help.
Got myself
in a bit of trouble'
I mean, nothing of my doing
but something I can'! shake.
- What are we
talking about here?
- Local guy,
moves a lot of product.
Could be a big catch.
- You want to go informer'?
- You're my parole officer,
right?
Isn't this
what I'm supposed to do'?
[phone line 'trilling]
- It's Deacon.
- You got him?
- Yeah, he's right here'
- Yeah?
- You don'! have to be
a criminal mastermind
to pay Some guy off.
You made your one mistake,
Foley.
You make any more,
and you're dons.
I want my answer by tonight.

Congratulations.
The good news?
You have a very good
circulatory system,
The bad news is,
I learned some
pretty nasty things in prison.
Did you know a small knife
can cause just as much damage
as a big knife?
Take this one, for instance.
I use it to cut fruit.
But if I press it here
and make a cut
about an inch long,
you'll bleed to death
in almost two minutes.
- Listen, Foley-
- No, you listen.
If we're gonna pull this grift
together,
you're gonna have to promise me
two things.
- Fuck you, Foley.
You're not in control.
Don'! you get it'!
[screaming]
- These are my conditions.
First, Iris will never hear
a whisper of what you told me.
If you so much as hint at it,
I will kill you.
You understand?
- Yes.
- Secondly,
if we pull this con,
you will follow my instructions
to the smallest detail,
no exceptions.
You got it?
- Yes.
- You know,
you don't sound too convincing.
- Yes!
I-yes, I understand.
Absolutely!
Fuck!
[whimpering]
-Okay
- [gasping]
- Come on.
- Fuck!
- [humming]
- We need to worry about
being disturbed?
- No, no, we're fine.
The clinic closed at 7:00,
and I'm here
through the night
to make sure the junkies don't-
don't break in.
- Are you even
a fucking doctor'?
Am I getting stitched up
by a fucking janitor'?
- In Serbia,
I was a surgeon.
Here, I'm a night watchman'
- Miro knows what he's doing.
Fixed me up plenty of times
in prison.
- Look, you saved my ass
a hundred limes.
This is nothing.
I owe you.
- Enough with
fucking memory lane!
Just...
[groans]
Just fucking finish.
I've made preparations,
Foley.
I get taken out,
two things happen'
Cops find Jake
with your DNA all over him,
and Iris finds out
about her long-lost daddy.
And wherever you've got her
stashed, she can be found.
- Here's what I need:
a high-end hotel room
so I can get in shape
and work out
the details of the grift.
I need a woman
to play the catch.
Preferably older,
experienced.
I need an I.T. guy
who can open
international accounts
and walk me through the tech.
And I need a place to stage
the actual grift,
preferably a house-
big, expensive,
isolated.
- [chuckling] Yes.
You see?
This is exactly
what I'm talking about, partner'
- We're not partners, Ethan.
I had a partner once'
I killed him.
[dramatic music]
♫
♫
♫
- Looking good, Foley.
Let me introduce you
to your wife, Helena.
Helena,
this is your husband.
Latest husband, anyway.
[glasses clink]
- So you know
how this grift works?
- Yeah, first half, anyway.
Ethan's the inside man.
You're the outside man.
I'm the catch-
coked-up wife
of some rich guy,
- Real estate developer'
- Right.
So long work's already done'
Six months ago, someone stole
some money from the mark.
- 250 grand.
- And that someone
is no longer with us'
But he had an accomplice:
me.
- So I tell the mark,
"Hey, you remember
that dumb motherfucker
who ripped you off'-
- Let her tell it.
- Ethan takes me to the mark,
I say, "It's not my fault,
wasn't my idea."
250 got stolen
in a drug deal.
Mark wants his money now,
but I've only go!
one way to pay it:
my rich husband.
You.
. See?
I told you she's a pro.
She knows her part.
- I know my part,
but who's the mark'?
Are you out of your mind?
You never said we were
pulling this on Xavier.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do
about it, bitch?
Are you suddenly in a position
where you can just walk away?
- Hey.
Don't disrespect her.
When we're on the grift,
our lives
are in each other's hands.
Or do I need to remind you
about the promise you made?
- Apologies.
- Are you absolutely positive-
I mean, 100% sure-
this money can't be traced?
- Twice a year,
Xavier flies in
to make sure that his money
is laundered and dispersed
to clean accounts.
He always does it in person.
But he's such a greedy prick
that if he finds out that
he can make an extra percentage
by fucking someone over,
I guarantee you,
he will do it.
- The grift is not about
taking someone's money.
It's about gaining
their confidence.
The key is to set up
a situation
where even though the mark knows
he's fucking me over,
he gets to act
like he's doing me a favor,
like he's running the grift.
That's why it's called
the Samaritan.
[knock on door]
Yeah?
- it's Helena.
Um, I just wanted
to thank you for, um...
Well, I guess for not being
a son of a bitch.
- It's nothing.
- Got anything to drink
in here?
- Ethan send you?
- Fuck you.
I'm not a whore'
- I'm sorry.
- I'm here
because I like the look of you.
And like you said,
if this thing falls apart,
we end up dead.
- This is not part
of the grift.
What do you want, Helena?
- I know who Ethan is,
but I don'! know who you are
or why you're here.
I was gonna do it
the old-fashioned way
and ball it out of you,
but you got all...
professional,
so now I just got to
come out and ask.
It's unbecoming.
[down-tempo jazz music playing]
- So Ethan's got you loo?
- Hook's in deep.
You really think
if we pull this off,
he'll just pay us off
and cut us loose?
- I don't know.
- I think he'll just keep
coming back and...
taking and taking
and taking,
- We'll get through this.
- Ain't no "we," Foley.
Thinking any different
will just get you dead.
[dramatic piano music]
- Does this look like
the kind of place
that a slick-ass
real estate developer
would build for himself'?
- How far is this
from the club?
- 17 minutes.
- Exactly 17 minutes?
- Trust me, I timed it.
And before you say anything,
I fucking drove
at the right time of night,
We got 12 hours left
for any final details.
- You absolutely sure
Xavier is gonna drive
all the way out here himself'!
- I know him.
He's got a hard-on
for showing me
how to do things right.
If I knock Helena around
too hard,
he'll step in and take control
of the situation'
♫
[elevator dings]
Hey, come on in.
- We're gonna be late
picking up Helena.
What's up, you got one
of your club bitches up in here?
- Boy, that's why
I wanted to see you first.
Get you motivated
for the big show.
Come on down and say hi.
. [sighs]
- Hi.
Thought you got rid of me,
huh?
Couldn't figure out
why you were lying.
Just had to find out why.
But I never thought
you'd blow me off for money.
- I don't know
what you think you're doing-
- You don'! get to tell me
what to do anymore,
I cleaned up.
I started to kick.
I did everything right
But you just wanted me
out of the way
so you'd get right back
to the grift.
You're the real addict here,
Foley.
Not me.
- I need to talk to you alone.
- Anything you need
to say to me,
you can say
in front of him.
[kissing. moaning]
Good luck tonight.
Come home rich.
- You ready to go to work?
[elevator dings]
You know,
I got no choice here.
She's my leverage
in case you're thinking
of making
some last-minute changes
to the plan.
You're running
the angles, eh?
Trying to figure out
how to get her away from me.
But then what?
Then what do you do?
You slay with her?
Maybe you guys
should just be friends.
- Ethan.
Stop talking.
♫
[knocking]
- Helena!
Helena,
you better be ready.
[door creeks]
♫
Messy bitch.
' [scoffs]
- Fucking bitch!
You know, she probably
fucking planned this all along,
just waiting for
the right moment to fuck me!
Fuck!
[glass shatters]
[groans]
- A woman is dead,
Ethan,
- Yeah, and I'm gonna have
a fucking big, long cry over it
once you tell me
how to fix this!
- Well, we're not going
to fix it.
This is a three-person grift.
Husband, wife, dealer.
Everything pivots on the catch.
No catch, no grift.
The mark arrives
in about three hours.
We're out of time.
- You got to know someone
from back in the day.
- I could call Gretchen,
but that finger
you chopped off her hand
might give away the fact
that she's not the coked-up
trophy wife
of a real estate developer.
- Fuck you!
- You've done a pretty good job
of that already'
Fucking yourself too.
. [moaning]
♫
- No.
- We need the catch.
- No goddamn way.
- What?
She's not smart enough'?
Pretty enough?
Quick enough?
What's missing
that Helena had'?
- Not gonna happen.
- Not your call,
- Do I have a choice here?
Or am I just supposed to go
whichever way the wind blows?
- Yes,
of course you have a choice.
Split's 60/20/20.
That's $1.6 million for you.
What do you say?
- Yeah.
- It'll never work.
- You know I can do it.
Or is it that I'd be
playing your wife?
Fair enough.
The mark would have to be
pretty stupid
to buy me as your wife,
but I could be your daughter,
The grift
calls for a cokehead wife
getting dirty behind
her husband's back, right?
But it could just as easily
be a wayward daughter
stuffing daddy's money
up her nose,
- She's right.
- Look, it's not
that you're not pretty enough,
quick enough,
or smart enough'
It's just that
you're not ready,
and we don't have time
to get you ready.
You don't know the turns.
You don'! know the backups.
You don't know the gear'
Make a mistake,
you can get all of us killed.
- You know,
there are things worse
than getting killed, Foley.
I think you know that.
- How much do you owe?
- What'?
- I want to know
how deep you're in this
that you're so willing
to commit suicide to get out.
Like your dad.
- We can pull this off.
- Ifs over.
- I need this.
I can take my cut,
getaway from here-far away.
Don't you think
I deserve that?
- Come with me.
- You know what, Foley?
You want out?
Fine.
Get the fuck out.
She stays.
- Leave with me,
right now.
Don'! listen to him.
- No, don't listen to me.
I'm only trying
to make us all fucking rich!
- I'm staying.
- Everything I touch
turns to shit.
- Why do you think that is?
- Jesus.
- I found him.
- Yeah?
- Daddy?
Help me.
[Click]
- What did you do, huh?
Did you tell her'?
What did you tell her?
- It's the grift.
- What are you talking about'?
- We started without you,
Xavier thinks that I've gone
to pick up Iris'
millionaire daddy
to settle
her big fat drug debt.
Hey, neither of us
were just gonna let you
walk away, Foley.
This could be
your masterpiece.
Wipe all those other clippings
off my wall.
- The chances of this working
are slim to none'
- oh.
Well, then those are the chances
of Iris surviving the night.
If we don't do this,
he'll put a bullet in her,
I've seen him do it before
for a lot less.
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You know why.
- I didn't want to kill
your father, Ethan.
I had no choice.
- So then you're familiar
with this kind of predicament,
We're talking about
Iris' life here,
Now is your chance
to finally play daddy.“
Daddy,
Suit up.

Thought you were gonna shave.

- Here's daddy'
- I'm sorry to say
your little angel
has got herself
into a bit of a bind.
- Well, unfortunately
this isn't the first time.
How much does she owe you?
- $250,000.
- Bet you're loving this,
huh?
More proof you were right
to send me away.
- I sent you away
for your own good.
- But you just wanted me
out of the way.
You were never there for me.
When mom died,
I had nothing,
Nobody wanted me.
- This?
This-what's happening here,
right now,
this is your doing!
And in your usual fashion,
you expect me
to pay for your mistakes!
- Enough!
This is not
family fucking therapy.
I want my money now,
- Please.
Help me.
Daddy, I need help.
[Cries]
. [sighs]
My cell phone.
- I didn't tell you
to do anything.
- I'm sorry.
Had you planned on
cashing a check'?
I'm going to make
an electronic transfer.
- So I'm supposed to give you,
what, my account information?
- I don't want
your account information'
I don't want to know
your name.
I don't want to know
a goddamn thing about you.
[phone beeps]
There.
I've just moved
all the funds
out of one
of my offshore accounts,
except for $250,000.
I've deleted my pass code.
All you need to do
is enter yours.
You'll have full access
to the funds,
and you can transfer them
anywhere you want.
[cell phone beeping]
- Yes, I need you to check
on immediate activity
in the Belize account.
Oh, yes, that's because
I don't care
what time it is there.
$250,000,
[cell phone beeps]
- Are we done?
- How much do you keep
in these offshore accounts?
- Um, that particular one,
I had a little under
$3 million.
- Any with more than 8?
- Why?
- I'd like you
to consider a new deal.
I have $8 million
that needs cleaning,
and it seems to me
you run
an excellent maid service,
Now, before you decide-
Vernon?
Would you get us
a little taste?
This is going to be
very nice.
Are you building
a wine cellar'?
- Uh, yes.
- L-l once bought
a divorce house
because of the wine cellar.
The wife, who was selling,
took me down
because her
soon-to-be ex-husband's
unbelievable collection
was still there.
'59 Lafite.
'61 Haut-Brion.
'45 Brunello.
Absolutely stupendous.
And then my eye
catches the thermostat,
and I say to her, "I don't know
how to tell you this,
"but this cellar
should be at 55 degrees.
This one's turned up to 76."
And she looks at me
with a kind of squint in her eye
and, just ice-cold
she says, "I know.
- [laughs]
Yes, I have a '61 Lafite
I'm saving
for a special occasion,
It's on its final turn
and the top of the bottle
is going to be tired.
- The rest is in the car,
- What's going on here?
- Watch and learn.
The usual channels
cost me a minimum of 30%,
That's $2.5 million.
This is 8, clean.
- What if he tries to-
- He won't try anything.
If he does,
we'll change his mind.
- It occurs to me
that if you want my help
with your little problem,
it should be worth more to me
than just a return
of my $250,000.
- And your daughter.
- 15%.
- [chuckles]
And so we agree on 10.
- [sighs]
I don't know.
[gunshot]
- [screams]
- My God!
- What the fuck
did you do that for'?
- Thought you wanted
to change his mind.
- Help me!
- No, no, no, no.
The only way you can help
your daughter is to do the deal.
- I have to get her
to a hospital!
- And so you shall
when the business is done.
- Sit up. Sit up.
Put pressure on it.
Hold it.
What do you want me to do?
- The same as before.
You put some funds
into an account for me.
You lake your cash.
We never see each other again.
Do we have a deal?
Do we have a deal?
- No.
No deal.
He can't make the deal
because he's not
a real estate developer.
He's a grifter,
And this is a con.
Which makes you the mark.
- Why would you tell me this?
- Because nothing changes
unless you make it change.
- What the fuck
are you talking about'!
- I'm telling you because
I don't care about your money.
I just want that piece of shit
to know how close he came
to getting
everything he ever wanted
right before
you shoot him dead.
No, not him!
Him.
- She's lying!
- You little shit!
- She is his daughter!
- I know, Ethan.
- He is your father!
- I know, Ethan.
You can'! hurt me anymore.
- You know'?
- I went to see Celia.
- I have been
in this place before,
and there's only one way
for this to end'
I will tell you
what you want to know,
and if you don't believe
what I say,
then just put a bullet in me.
Just let her go.
- Nobody is going anywhere
ever again.

You stay here.
Stay here.
Stay here.

That's why I have to do this.
