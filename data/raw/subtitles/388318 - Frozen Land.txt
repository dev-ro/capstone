I never wanted this to happen.
Do you remember the questions
we asked each other as kids?
How big is space?
Where does the sky end?
Where does the sea begin?
Why can't I scream
when I feel bad?
What's the point of living
if this life is merely hell?
But we have to believe
that in the end - 
things work out for the best.
Otherwise, nothing
makes any sense.
FROZEN LAND
Commencement, conflict,
transformation, and so on.
What's relevant is what is
said, not how it's said.
Tell me about Tolstoy's world.
He discusses one -
where people peddle
their own private hells.
Person A shoves it onto B -
who cannot help but pass
it onto C. And so on
Essays back next week please.
And don't download
them from the net.
This is our new EDP teacher.
- Antti Arhama, physics and EDP.
Pertti Smolander. Literature
studies ïï though not very literate.
I'll be back shortly. Pertti,
can I see you for a moment?
You're talked of
as our most popular, -
possibly our best teacher.
I wouldn't know about that.
But we have
a problem which means -
we are going
to have to let you go.
Our main focus
on EDP and math -
means we don't need
so many Lit. teachers.
It's beyond my control I'm
afraid. I'm really sorry.
UNEMPLO YMENT
Hell. Cold
Was there this much snow last
winter when I got the boot.
Where are we going?
Niko! Niko!
Turn it down.
You're like Oblomov.
You only bloody lie there.
Pull yourself together.
I promised to
lend this to these guys.
Just temporarily.
The CD player?
I gotta disk in it.
It'll stay there.
Keep it. Have fun!
We didn't like it anyway!
Get out of here. Go on.
You know where the door is.
I saved a long
time for that player.
Leave me alone.
Just like your mom did.
Take the whole shelf.
Give that to me.
Are you trying to teach ME?
Are you raising ME,
you punk?
Move on out!
Niko, please.
Lend me a twenty.
If I had it, I would.
I don't have any.
"I don't have any".
Where did you get it before?
- None of your business
Beat it!
And don't come back!
Not without a job!
Were you sleeping? - No
Oh, yes you were.
Sleeping this late.
Hi. Happy New Year.
What am I doing with these?
Is this a bad time to call?
How come you're
not opening the door?
What's the plan for
tonight? Fireworks?
My cousin's throwing
a party. - I'll join you.
We can do the fireworks.
Can I take a nap here? I'm
fucked. - Be my guest.
I have to take
my parents to the airport.
We're off. - My old
man threw me out.
What? - Nothing.
See you tonight.
Chill out. Lock the door.
What's this place we're
going? - It's my cousin's.
What's in there? - What are you
up to? Where are you going?
Let's take him with us.
- Are you coming with us?
Heavy duty.
Going downhill is much
less hassle than going up.
Mankind is
coming to the end ...
Yeah. The end is near.
I mean really close.
Can you
upgrade my computer?
Six, five, four, -
three, two, one!
Ten, nine, eight
What's up? Pass it this way.
Pass it on to Tuomas.
- He won't have any.
What's that?
Print it out! - No way.
Go on. Let's take a look..
Can I have a line?
Just one.
I'll have your line, too.
Coming, coming!
Tuomas. Why not give it a try?
- Don't touch anything!
Come back to the party!
- You know you can trust me.
Niko, come over here!
- No sweat. I'm not stupid.
How much for the player?
- Let's say about forty.
Come on. Twenty is more
like it. - Don't make me laugh.
Twenty-five. - Thirty.
Let's make it twenty-five.
- Thirty's as low as I go.
OK. Thirty it is.
Don't you have anything
smaller? - Not right now
But hey! That's money,
too. Money! Money!
Two, three, four...
There you go! - Were
you trying to screw me?
Happy New Year!
- Same to you.
You fucking stupid bitch!
Are you blind?
You'd let them pa y
you in toilet paper!
How can you tell? It looks
real! - No hologram!
What-gram? - Holo! Hologram!
They all have one these days!
How should I know?
These euros all look
like funny money to me.
All you do round here is
read the tabloids and booze.
Good morning.
Do you have any old
coins? - Old coins...
Fucking old coins!
BOOZE
It's been looked after.
Barely used.
Just need a bit of cash.
It was an engagement
present, just six months old.
Wide-screen, 28".
Five hundred.
A thousand.
It's as good as new, y'know.
Still six payments to go.
Five-ten. - OK.
If that's your final offer
These don't keep their value.
Always a newer model.
There's a big note in there.
Money is money.
What shampoo do you
use? - Why is that?
Your hair's a bit limp.
It happens I have some state
of the art shampoo in the car.
I don't need it.
- You could stock it here.
We don't sell shampoo.
- Hell of a profit margin.
Buy cheap, sell dear.
Fat profits. - No deal.
You've got a new routine.
- Yeah.
Why are you
still hanging about?
Just thought I'd return the
keys. - I'll pass them on.
How about dinner tonight?
Somewhere rich.
Your choice. - Why?
Why not?
Where's the money from?
I have a new job.
Good for you.
What restaurant you working
in? - Not in a restaurant.
A household appliance store.
TVs and stuff.
Hey, wait. How about
a drink? - It's no use.
Or maybe a drive?
Isto, you're
a really nice guy.
But it just doesn't
work for me any more.
Please. I love you.
A couple of drinks...
Can I buy you dolls some
hot shots? - No thanks.
Isto pays for everything.
Let's go to a hotel.
You're gorgeous,
you know that?
Fuck off!
Don't mess with me, asshole!
Do I look like I'm broke?
This guy's not with us.
What do you think this is?
What's this? What's this?
It's money!
I'm not a forger.
I sold my TV.
I have a Ford Mercury.
American.
A great fucking car.
Let me outta here!
Morning, Virtanen. Another
day, another hearing.
You haven't been messing
with drugs, have you?
Don't feel like talking?
Can I go home?
- That's not up to us.
Drop your pants
and spread your legs.
Just relax.
OK. Put your clothes on.
The only sure thing is death!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Jerk! Jerk! Faggot!
Straight through
- and no alarm.
Smart ass security
systems - complete waste.
When are the police coming?
- In the afternoon.
Matikainen! Someone to
see you! - Fucking hell!
Sit down.
What do you want?
Looks like
business is good.
Is that what
you're here to tell me?
I would like to -
to make a new deal, -
if that's OK.
I'll cover the interest
with a vacuum cleaner.
That's for you.
Plus a year's supply
of hair shampoo.
It's good shampoo.
Dandruff...
Do you take me
for an utter moron?
I'm temporarily short of cash.
- When do you have it?
When the snow melts...
When? - Let's say in May.
By Mother's Day.
- Mother's Day?
Where's this money coming from?
Selling vacuum cleaners?
I've told you that selling
Hoovers is bullshit.
How many have you sold?
How many? Tell me.
How many exactly?
Quite a few.
And a lot of hair shampoo.
Where is the money?
If you don't pa y up, you lose
your car. Fucking simple.
Can you cut me some slack.
For old times' sake.
Jartsa ...
Goodbye.
Hi there.
Allow me to demonstrate
this vacuum cleaner.
What brand do you use?
- An ordinary one.
Have you ever
seen one of these?
Do you speak Finnish?
- No, no.
What sort of
shampoo do the kids...
What shampoo do you
use? - Me or the dog?
Latest model.
- A bit expensive.
There's a payment plan...
- No, no...
Metal casing.
- Not interested.
A black dress
shows all the dust...
Made in Sweden.
The land of honest labor.
We don't buy anything.
My bathroom's
full of shampoo...
How old is the dog?
Didn't you see the sign?
- I am not vending...
I'm a sales representative...
- Really? Bye!
When you're
dealing with alcohol, -
you're dealing with
a cunning adversary.
By ourselves, we're
not strong enough.
We need
God's assistance.
We'll take it in turn
starting with Teuvo.
My name is Teuvo.
I'm an alcoholic.
Where should I start today?
Today wasn't exactly
a major success.
My mind is blurry.
I haven't been close -
to anyone -
for a long time.
For reasons of my own.
I guess my car has
been my best buddy.
Sounds funny.
But now I've lost it.
But spring is on its way.
A time of hope.
And I thank God
for a sober day today.
Thank you... Mauri.
I'm Mauri.
And I'm an alcoholic.
It's tough making
it here but I'm happy -
to know I'm not alone.
Would you like
vacuuming to be easier?
It's time to make
your life easier.
Open the door!
Bastard! You wanna die?
This is for the five hundred.
With some interest!
THE AXE
Fuck!
The light's red, you jerk!
You looking for
a knuckle sandwich?
Homo! Faggot!
Hi. Any vacancies?
Just for the night.
Alcohol goes into circulation
when it hits your lips.
That first slug
of an ice-cold beer.
It just hits your fucking brain!
And let's talk about the profit!
What's the purchase price?
Maybe 80 cents?
The keg costs you 50 euros.
But after that -
when you've once paid
for the keg, it's kinda free.
You following me?
Some places have the nerve -
to ask for eight euros a pint.
Or seven ... six. Of course,
it's more often five.
But starting from nine.
A coffee, please.
And another one.
Another coffee, please.
Was it good? - Sorry?
How did it taste?
The coffee?
Fine.
You look familiar.
Where you from?
- Hollola.
How about you?
I live in Nummela these days.
I have a major
car dealership there.
Cars?
- Yes, big, fancy cars.
How about
the financing options?
Depends on the down
payment. Isto. Virtanen.
Hurskainen.
Teuvo. Teukka.
"What shampoo do you use?"
We're selling the same brand.
Like they say in the US,
the world's one big network.
Any good bonuses lately?
- Quite a bit.
I have a vacuum cleaner
business on the side.
I owe money
to the shampoo supplier.
Are you going
to stick to coffee all night?
Let me get you a round.
We'll put the drinks
on my room bill.
A glass of milk.
- A glass of milk!
You're drinking milk!
Milk.
A man who drinks milk.
A double whiskey!
A double whiskey.
Now we're talking.
Milk, followed
by a double whiskey.
Way to go!
Milk lines your stomach.
"Our company is doing a-okay..."
With all the accessories.
"Our company is doing a-okay..."
Isn't she a beauty?
One click and everything opens.
Let's party!
We'll round up some girls.
I release my aggressions.
Fuck! I'm going
the beat the car up!
Tonight we're going for a spin.
Go on, check out that box!
It's a fucking TV!
Sky channels and all.
14 channels and MTV!
- I'd like to have a go.
No jerk is driving my
car drunk! No one!
No drunk is driving my car.
Look, Teukka
Hey! Let's wank!
All emissions
go through 8 filters.
Hose attachment
is in the rear.
One click and
everything opens.
Fire at will! Take cover!
You're so beautiful.
Can I kiss you?
No, don't! Stop it.
If I'm not interested
then I don't want it.
Help! - Hey, Teukka.
He's trying to rape me.
That's no way to treat a
woman. Gently does it.
You gotta to
be gentle with them.
Like this.
A few kisses.
Look. This is the way.
Gently, Teukka. Look.
Smile. Smile.
This is the way.
Smile.
Get the fuck out of here. Go
screw your vacuum cleaner.
Help! Help!
Don't kill me! Don't!
A guy with a moustache and
mullet hair. A flyer's jacket.
Is he still here? - Yes.
Will this be on the
same bill? - Yes.
Anything from the
mini bar? - No.
I'd like to see his records.
- Just a moment.
237.
FAMILY
How about
another two weeks?
Have you
been depressed lately?
What if I just go home.
I don't want any more leave.
How've you been handling
your job lately? Overall?
What do your partners think?
Everything's fine.
You're sleeping ok?
You're not taking
unnecessary risks?
For depression:
1 tablet as required.
Hi. - Hi.
Don't you have your key?
I left it at home.
Any homework? - None
today. I did it all at school.
We were
learning about colors.
There's a new color.
Oh, come on.
Cut it out!
Are you sure you're OK?
- Yes. I must go.
Personnel shortages.
Give me a kiss.
Have you lived in
Helsinki a long time?
Almost four years now.
Where? - Downtown.
Smack in the center.
Close to the Bank of Finland.
At Ritarikatu.
- That's a nice place.
The guys at the precinct say
that you're doing a good job.
Yeah? Maybe I am.
You know these
streets pretty well...
Shit. No reflector!
- I thought he had one.
That was a close call.
I've got some hot coffee.
Want some? - Not for me.
You haven't taken
detective course yet?
I've been sort of tied up.
Hey, when
was Karl Marx born?
Sometime in the
last millennium.
In the 19th century.
You should know.
Hell!
This is 237, in pursuit
of a red Ford Sierra.
We're driving
on Sahaajankatu.
Moving at high speed, -
turning left
