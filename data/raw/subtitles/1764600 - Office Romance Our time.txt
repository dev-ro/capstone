Welcome to a normal,
usual office of an Russian company
This is Alice
And here's Mark
Mark and Alice got the job in the same day.
They both thought it was a good sign.
As between colleagues, sympathy came too
First it was their little secret.
But once Mark left for two weeks
to the firms in Magadan.
Alice went to her grandmother, also for two weeks. But at the office
they returned both with the same bronze color of skin.
Since then, for their co-workers,
this ceased to be a mystery novel.
Then it became worse ...
Then, even worse ...
And, finally, a complete disaster.
Every second office romance is broken into pieces.
My name is Ludmila Kalugina, and I'm the director of an
credit rating agency.
- Good morning, Ludmila Prokofievna.
Everyone should know their place, it's the only way to maintain order. 
Subordination, punctuality, planning, professionalism
- these are the four pillars on which rests the business.
True professionals are few. You remember since when you had a package
well done, you have a car well repaired, or well served in the restaurant ?
- Well, you can't pay attention? That's
for the service you have? No! I do it myself.
My name is Anatoly Novoseltsev. Tolia for friends. For the strangers...  also Tolia. 
And two of the most lovely persons in the world call me ...
- Dad, listen, that's cool music.
- Kate, whats this song? I can't listen! Not right now. 
- OK. - Why do not you like Eminem? - He's a fool.
Five days a week from 8:30 I lead my daughters to school. The School is good, but far from home.
This is the story of my life: all good, but very far. 
By the way, I am a financial analyst, an office worker, just like those guys on the poster: energetic, focused, insensitive to stress. 
Every word is right for me ... well almost.
In this town, a sensible worker does not fit. Only simulators, poseurs, diletants. 
But I have a good command on my agency.I appreciate this. 
If the manager is 100% given to the work, then his lunchtime is... at dinner. This is true.
- Well, with God! We are late! - He's already here.
- Girls let's ... - You hear it here!
My staff called me 'The Frump'. Because of my beautiful eyes, of course!
Although not essential, it's important that they are afraid.
- Tolia, Tolia ...
- So, Katya, Masha, behave well, go ahead... Do not kiss the boys ! 
- I will not, I have a lip makeup. 
- Is it 9:30?
- From 2 pm to 4 pm you have a meeting. 
The stupidity is that I have no time: sleep - 5 hours, eat - 25 minutes, make-up - 15 minutes, for my personal life - 10 minutes...
... during free time you want to work.
- Vadim, hello
- Hello
- 'The Frump' asked about me? 
- No. 
- Excellent.
- She has now no meeting, so you can get in - No, not necessary ... I fear
to stay with she alone. - You are so funny, Novoseltsev, in general.
- Listen, Vadim, can you give her this report? Only
please tell her that I brought it yesterday evening. Thank you.
- Look at it ... from my new collection, among other things, with the Motherland, and Fidel...
- Hmm... it's not Fidel, it's Che Guevara...
- What a city! Solid bases...
- You know, I put the badger on the set conditions,  to let it choose,  you know me.
It said yes and snapped. Well, of course, I'm certainly guilty, but in the end I'll apologize ...
- Chinese tea, increases the potency and... the sensitivity
in erogenous zones. My name is Yuri Samokhvalov.
- Very nice, Vadim. - ... Nice shirt... - Mucho
gratsias. - I am here for the director, he knows. - Please.
- Three Ji ...
- Gee, as the point ...
Knocks 3 times on the table.
- What you're beautiful ... 
- No Money !  
- Please lend me to pay...
- And how much do you want? - 5000 
- 5000? - Repairs to the school.
- Tolia, I am poor, I bought it... - What ?
- The earrings... - So... - And you thought ? - No, no.
- Oooo... well, look, you like it? Yes, I do not? - Wait, you said it was a gift.
- You think I am a lonely woman after 30? - No. - So what then, Tolia?
- Olga, what you have beautiful earrings. What a gift, who is he?
Millionaire? - Hmm... thanks! - Five and a half! - ...Hmmm.
- It's still secret information... a group of private investors is willing to invest in a project. 
The idea is to buy around the world seven credit rating agencies and combine them into one large corporation. 
In a month, we could enter into an international team, but, of course, for this we need to work at global level.
I want you to finish the presentation of our agency. 
- Presentations - is my hobby.
By the way, Lyudmila Prokofievna, I have for you a small gift
- Chinese Tea, treats fevers, calms the nervous system, increases economic activity, please.
- Let's get going... today I fired two bums and I'm afraid that was not the end.
- Vadik, send me down Novoseltsev, in 2 minutes.
- Got it. Novoseltsev, to Kalugina. 
Tolia, only a half minutes.
- Sorry, it's what Novoseltsev? 
- Yes, the problem is that he's a "nobody"
... no initiative, no ambitions, nothing.
- ... called me?
- I called...
- Tolia? - Yura... - Tolia? - Yura ... - Well, old devil...
Grown up as an adult... Give! And a handsome man! Tolia!
Tolia is an old friend. We studied together, and together were
involved in motocross, well in a team. Iron men ahead!
- It's a pity that Anatoly Efremych forgot how to play as a team. You Anatoly Efremych, ever wonder why
some banks go down with the savings of their customers? - Thought... - Yes? - Probably not deep enough.
- Why do financial crises occur? That lead to the devaluation of savings and loans more expensive.
- I am to blame for this too ? Yes?
- Ludmila Prokofievna, you know, here and in China ... 
- That's it, that China's accumulation of ... and we, in our wild terror, because some lazy analysts
use non-secure data, disorienting investors and consumers. Do you want to discredit me in front of investors? 
- No, of course ...
- From now on you will prepare the presentation of our agency under the leadership of Mr. Samokhvalov. You are free.
- What kind of people that breaks down the technique... They can not understand and there are only 6 buttons !  
- Step, do not hurry up... Close it, yet they all break! 
- Broke, break, repaired!
- What are you doing? You're a system administrator? 
- System Administrator... 
- Well, go on the Internet, to fix it.
- Olga, come here, we need to talk.
- What?
- You know who our 'Frump' designate as alternate?
- Listen here ... I do not care. 
- Yura Samokhvalov.
- How does he look like?
- James Bond. So, well, Olga... Olga, arise
- Tolia, Tolia ... - Yura, Yura... 
- Olga, Olga... - How can we that... long ago have not seen you... 
Oh, what a beautiful look, her...
- He's pretty close to me...
- Tolia, whay you did not tell me that Yura comes? I'd not even changed clothes. Yura ...
- Well, how are you? - Normal. - Why are you normal? Yura, we are very good, but quite good! 
Right now just a little more ... We have a new round of layoffs, I'm afraid we will be fired me and Tolia... You know?
And Tolia has two children.
- Two girls. 
- Well done!
- Yuri, but could you lend me 5000 ?
- Euro?
- No. Roubles.
- Tolia, I would give you.
- Not nice to get a loan from friends.
- Tolia, well ...
- I'll give back.
- Yura, and I'm alone ...
- Oh, my phone, sorry.
- Ay, ay, ay. Now I think it's fixable.
- Oh ...
- Ludmila Prokofievna ...
- Yes?
- How are these shoes?
- I do not like, such as sweet. Bust.
- Excellent... mean normal women will wear.
- Shark - the perfect predator, it is enough for one small drop of blood and the shark feels it and at far.
When you have been able to finish the weak and become stronger through this, and if tonight, ladies, you will put away any fat,
and you do the same in the rest of the day, you will be able to be as accurate, fast, ruthless, as a ... Shark (chorus repeats).
A shark is always in motion, if stops he choke. A shark is always in search of prey, a shark has no friends (chorus repeat) well. Good afternoon.
- Once again, I'm a champion, nothing changes, Tolia.
- That's why I just missed: out of respect for authority.
- And for a good reason. I'm the best. I'm handsome. You want me?
- I do not sleep with the boss.
- It's your loss. You want something extra, pal?
- Here we go.
- I want to give an inaugural party. To lead all company management in Turkey this weekend. Charter flights, best hotel.
- Fine.
- My position requires it. By the way, you fly with us.
- I'm not going to fly.
- Tolia, you fly with us. Drink, relax, dance. And tell Kalugina a toast.
- Yes, that she can say this: "Mr. Novoseltsev, your toast is ill-prepared !".
- Tolia, believe it to a master of corporate fight, this is your last chance. This Kalugina is dissatisfied with you.
- And by whom it is generally satisfied? She is dissatisfied also with you. Simply you do not notice it.
- Tolia, I insist.
- And Olya goes with us?
- Olga? Let's take also Olga.
The music is playing.
- Well, friends? Now, it is very warm and wet t-shirt contest will begin. The public, why are not cheering?
 Why I did not hear? You'll now part of something fun. Ladies, do not let your breasts to lie in bras, the viewer wants to see, show it all, the audience wants that!
- Yura, and you remember how we were at the university? I was then a poor student, and you a good ...
- I was a good professor...
- Yes...
- And at first I did not want to punish you, and then... have decided to punish you... I remember everything, Olga ...
- Hi, you drink with me?
- Come on. For health ...
- Elly, come to us, we have fun.
- Eleanor ... Hi, handsome.
- Hi.
- Hi. And what are you doing, girls?
- Eeeem... brandig...
- Wow.
- Look, Tolia.
- What are you waiting for?
- It's hot.
- Take.
- What you say, can I be served warm?
- Of course. But your target, Don Juan, it's over there.
- No... I will not go...
- That's your main goal, go now, test if is warm enough, then take a knife and a fork and ate it. Got it?
- Luda, Lyus, Lyudmila Prokofievna... What do you want?
- I ?
- Well... some wine... wine ...
- And you, Novoseltsev, you are apparently an expert only in alcohol, right?
- Tolia, my name is Anatoly.
- Anatoly do not try to glue on me, in your case it is impossible to stick together.
- And what a case I have ?
- Hopeless.
- Hopeless?
- And in the end you're not sober enough...
- Why don't you wake me up ?
- Novoseltsev, you're free, go. And find yourself someone that fits to your size.
- Knock-knock.
- You again?
- Me.
- I've thought that I said goodbye to you already.
- But I think we are greeted.
- And I do not think so.
- You think not? This is interesting.
- Well there is one.
- That is Lyudmila Prokofievna.
- And I can also be very interesting.
- Do not think so.
- I. ...you know me ill. I'm not just your co-worker. Maybe I'm writing lyrics.
- Really?
- Yes. One from my latest: "Yura, fucking pump, where were you?"
- Is that all?
- All.
- You wrote this?
- Some wrote.
- I thought that the rapper was Nagano.
- So. But you know, this rap?
- I understand rap ...
- Yes? Do you understand? ..
- By the way, you're viewing is disgusting.
- My girl like me.
- Of course, a girl, probably younger than you.
- Yes, much. I, among others, have two girls.
- And, probably your pay goes all to your girls and on alcohol.
- All patch on my girls.
- Well, stop spitting on me.
- Sorry. I...
- And my hands, too, do not...
- Excuse me... Sorry ...
- I'd like to... it is possible? Thank you.
- You are a strong woman, huh? Strong women help the poor in spirit, right?
- Well, I hope you will not confess me?
- Well, are you sure that this is not my work.
- Sure.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- So let's see ...
- Come get dressed ... aaa
- Tssss, shhh, remove their hands. Hold please. So, you like it.
- Novoseltsev stop, I said ...
- Tolia! My name is Anatoly.
- Aaaaaaaa
- Excuse me.
- It's crazy, what are you doing?
- What is it? Do you dislike? What do you dislike?
- Yes, refrain from me, Tolia!
- Well, the contest of wet T-shirt wins... 
The lady who does not wear a bra, what's your name, naughty? Oops!
- Tolia, well, but you're the evil.
- I am a demon? She is a demon. It driving me crazy. Inhumane, without a bra. Get dry!
- You fool!
- Me...?
- What is happening?
- A second!
- Yura... Yuri G., hello. You called?
- Call.
- You call ...
- Do you know why? Because lately your behavior seems to me an offensive.
- I'm slowing down. 
- Then slow down...
- Give me a chance.
- Of course.
- You know, I have a broken system.
- Your system broke down?
- If you and show me the bug, we will be able to restore it.
- What a mess. Yuri Grigorich, have confidence, right now I restore the whole system.
- You ...
- No... do not think... I'm here by accident.
- Sit down.
- I'll sit... you know, for privacy. Just preparing your presentation.
- You, apparently, it's a habit? To be in the wrong place at the wrong time...
- Sorry.
- What is it? What? What happened? Why stop?
- It's okay, right now, we'll go, this happens if you do not fall, of course.
- What are you making fun all the time? I can not see through you.
- Do not bite me.
- Yesterday you said that I was brutal, unhuman...
- Human...
- Heartless.
- Passionate...
- Dry...
- Wet... Well, in the sense of... Yesterday you were...
- There you go again... Why do you hate me so?
- Why? I ...I love you ... 
Well, in the sense that we... We all love you... Somehow, you are just a gift to all of us. 
Well, in the sense that you certainly are not making gifts...
What, you are crying? Why are you crying?
- What is the difference why? Maybe I'm afraid of height there.
- Weep, weep, it's useful. You know, if you still can to cry, then all is not lost.
- You all think I'm a robot. What I'm...
- Stop howling.
- I want to weep and... Maybe I have not complained long ago...
- Take please.
- Tolia for what am I going to weep?
- Come to me, let's cry together. I always find a reason.
- You are well, Anatoly, you have kids.
- Yes... I have a girl and... another girl...
- What do you say... two girls...
- Two ! I have two girls...
- And I have... nobody...
- And your friends...
- They were once... One day my best friend decided to marry my fiance...
- That's rubbish.
- Yeah. Since then, I've avoided all my friends.
- How ? Physically?
- Stop ...
- And your job?
- What, at work? Four walls and no one there.
Do you know what's the worst thing? 
That wherever I wasn't there, everywhere, comes the evening.
If you knew how much I'm afraid of evenings, stayed late at work, 
and pretend that I was a lot of things to do, but really I just have nowhere to go.
And I in fact I'am only 30. Well, a maximum of 32.
- Well, yes ...
- You know, I was always sure I will learn, I will work, career, and eventually won as a career has made me. 
Anyway, what a thought. Thank you, Anatoly, I have never talked with anyone so.
- Tolia ...
- What?
- Thank you, "Tolia."
- Yes, thank you, Tolia.
- Tolia, stay, come here. Hey, why are you there with 'The Frump'? You're not fired? No?
- Olga, she's not 'Frump'.
The music is playing.
- Good evening. Ludmila Prokofievna ...
- You... you what?
- Ludmila Prokofievna... Could you help me? To still be of use, good analysts do not fall from a balcony.
- Let me have something, an arm or a leg.
- Legs not have a pen ...
- Let's embrace...
- So, you get that idea?
- Yes.
- Uuu ...
- Vouchsafe and take your hands off my "things"!
- Here are some "things" super...
- Well, this was a left-handed compliment. Take, I said.
- I can not... If I take off, I fall.
- Yes?
- Yes. Right now... right now...
- Hold on.
- Hold on. Tightly.
- So, you still want to stay more?
- For me as long as can be ...
- Lets...
- Remember that you could be smashed here because of your... broom.
- Anyone else would not accepted this, Lyudmila Prokofievna.
- No, why?
- And, as from analyst to an analyst, in my opinion, I know I am not indifferent for you
The music is playing.
Every fifth inhabitant of our country runs away of relationships at the workplace, 
but all 100% of men and women know exactly that this will not be any good .
- Kate, are you asleep?
- Not anymore.
- Kitten, tell me what you think about this tie?
- This? Only to a parent-teacher meeting.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Dad, are you in love?
- How do you know?
- We, the women feel that.
- Women... Sleep!
- Dad, you need some help.
- Whose?
- Welcome to the realm of fashion. I you have been waiting for. 
Hi! Hello. Do not touch it. 
That's for your father's motorcycle.
Tolia, hello! Girls who go through there magazines, beautiful girls.
Boy... Have to work. As you understand, a lot of work. Tolia, Stop.
But with God, Vadim.
For every day ...
Badger, I have in your studio the oligarch Novoseltsev. 
We'll do his costumes. Incidentally, I am working for your future. Yes...
- Novoseltsev, you are super hero after all.
- Just knocking in the wood.
- About... front... beauty.
- How are you doing here?
- Vadik, I'm still not finished.
- But this jacket is not...
- Tolia, forgive me, I'm just worried, you are my first... in the sense of a client.
- You're my first, too... in the sense of Haute Couture designer...
- ...Haute Couture ... you heard Yudashkin? Who's the designer? I'm best!
- What is important for a woman?
- What?
- It's a riddle. That she should tell every step to the men?
- Solution?
- Hmm... A true guy must give her an answer... I answered, and I'm gone ! Understand ? 
"I have prepared everything, the quarterly report, I Novoseltsev." 
Tolia, let's go!
- The answer is ...
- Answer me! "I am a man, I'm a guy, I'm Novoseltsev."
- Novoseltsev.
- Put the foot like this, and turn...
And again... "I answer, I'm a man, I've prepared the quarterly report..."
- Eeeee... It's not ready...
- "It's ready", that's your answer.
- Tolia, you are the king - the guy.
Well, Tolia, well.
- Before your eyes lie on the table, as a drawing board of unusual designer,  these small details that mean what you have in this life:
your strengths, your weaknesses, your affection.
Now we'll try to collect of this model your destiny and we look at the resulting parts.
Take your intelligence, it is part number 2, and connect with your business, part number 4,
now 9 and 8, are your main qualities - efficiency and ruthlessness of the competition.
Now, take the family, it is a red piece and attach it to the center.
- But it is not fixed.
- Of course, not fixed, ballast, to the side.
Now the fun part, the item number 10, it is our travels around the world, hobby, lovers, mistresses and children.
- If there are no children?
- Then the children away, they are making us weak.
Here, this is our life. The robot, built from our desire, our intellect, our ruthlessness, our willingness to pay for all his career,
and only this works, and only it can bring true joy, everything else must be pushed over the side.
- Cute midget... But hardly you can love it.
In general, anything that we did, bring not love to ourselves.
- And if someone loves me already?
- Grab it!
The music is playing.
- Here is this cool lipstick.
- Attention.
- Girls, can I also bury a look through it, okay?
- Listen, Step, but I have at 5th level 2 goblin, how do I go?
- There will not pass right through, there should be along the fence, go right, there will be gate, so there will pass.
- And with the golden key what needs to be done?
- The tower must be. Only when the dogs are evil, but I do not know how they go.
- It's not my thing.
- Yours, yours, take it...
Yes... and next time, try to feed the dogs!
- Nice update.
- Girl, Ludmila Prokofievna will be back later... Wait a little.
- So I look good? 
- Badger wait.
- Vadik, make me a cup of tea, and grab yourself for a talk...
30 seconds ...
Just joking ...
- Neighing.
- Badger, we just drank yesterday? Yes? Just drank? Yes?
- Novoseltsev... Tolia...
Nothing that I'm here?
- Imagine I wanted to call you and... I do not have your phone number... Strange, no?
This weekend in general was the strangest, and perhaps, the happiest of my life.
Walk down the street, all the people turn around, the feeling that all know everything about us.
Shall we go?
- Where to go? I'm at work.
- What kind of work? I have children at school that you shall know. It's important to me.
- Well, it means that you are Mary? ...and you Kate? Yes?
- Here's Kate, and I'm Masha.
- And I know you.
- Really?
- You are 'The Frump'.
- Dad comes with ice cream.
- Well, make him the boss, and you know that knowingly bought a suit?
- Girls, keep
Well you here without me? Bored?
What's wrong?
- You are, it turns out, Mr. Novoseltsev, a careerist.
- I'm a careerist?
- Yes.
- And where is she guessed, we did not say so, Mary?
- ...by myself
- By yourself? Finally, everything by herself, Mrs. Novoseltseva ...uh ...Kalugina.
- Eat that ice cream! It will be cool ... no, hot!  
- Whay my costume is bad?
- In that suit you were not allowed here.
- In the suit, by the way, I met with you ...
What?
- Nothing.
- There are only waiters in bow tie.
- And now look, girls, a coin, take a coin and rub it into the elbow, ... minute. 
Look at the coin and start rubbing her, look, rub, rub, rub, where? Where is the coin?
- Come here, swindler.
- Sorry girls, my boss.
- Actually, I'm his girl.
The music is playing.
- All the best.
- All the best.
- Olga, whay are you not going home?
- Lyudmila Profkovevna, I have more work.
- Well, all good.
- Yeah...
- All the best, Yuri G..
- All the best.
- Do you not go home, dear...?
- Ludmila Prokofievna...
No, no, I went there, and then... returned.
- You are all so sudden, Lyudmila Prokofievna.
- Yes. And I know how, Yuri G.?
- What?
- More... unpredictible
- Unpredictible?
- What are you, Yuri G., busy?
- Right now I am preparing a presentation for investors.
- Presentation? Yuri G., you know what? And I had such a suggestion. Consider?
- With pleasure... look at all your suggestions...
Ludmila Prokofievna, and you, you're a real 'Frump'. Come on, 'Frump'. Come on Lucy, I went in debt.
- What are you, Paris is not relevant, global warming, Badger, Europe goes under water, useful for your house in Ekaterinburg.
- Vadim?
- Oh, get lost Novoseltsev!
- Colleagues, in my opinion, this is kind of prepared provocation.
- Yes, this is not me... Where did you get this record?
- What do I do with you now, Yuri G.?
- I know what to do with him.
- Tolia, you get out of the office or I do it myself.
- Anatoly...
-  I'll not let you... yet!
- Yuri Grigorievich, I loaned from you money. I've counted all ... and... the coverage!
- Tolia, Tolia. Do not get excited, just You do not know yet.
- It seems to me more than I need.
- Anatoly Yefremovich, go to your job... we have a closed meeting.
- I saw you... you are dancing there, on the conferrence table!
- Tolia, Tolia, Tolia, do you mind?
- I don't know how is at you, the top executives, we are plain office workers, and everything is done so... like this...
- Right now, if she does not...
- And you must not pay any attention to me, at least he does not pay.
- Yes?
- Ludmila Prokofievna, do you think we should fix this problem?
- How to fix?
- Stop them...
- Well, warn now these warriors about...
- Please, hold this! 
- Nothing to fix... we need nobody to record, let the boys to talk.. to fight...
- Now what, Anatoly Prokofitch?
- Do you ?
- Do you ?
- I have what? Do you ?
- Do you ?
- And you do?
- In a ...
- Do you ?
- I what? Do you ?
- Do you ?
- Well... Iron men forward, right?
- But for this you're fired.
- Does not fit...
Only I do staff cuts! So, Yuri... Grigorich?
- Grigorich...
- Your services are no longer needed.
- But for this you will answer.
- Well, well, well... Come on, quietly, let's go to the hallway, quietly.
- You will regret.
- Tolia, you have not properly understood.
- But I saw it right.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- No, no, I do not think so.
- Thanks, no! You do not have to do it anymore. I did not expect a parental attitude toward me! Okay?
- Ah so, yes?
- Yes.
- Here's how you talk now?
- Yes. So to speak, and how should I talk to you? I have no sentiment for the manager.
- That's right, it's very true, must still somehow observe the chain of command. 
But you just gave evidence...
- To us, yes. Now, you give to others.
- What?
- Seems like.
- For all ... enough.
Take your presentation. Yes. Well, you wanted to be a boss, you have them.
- I thought you're really there... up in the air, but barely see your real presence here, Ludmila Prokofievna.
- How you could ?
- How you could ?
- How could you do it?
- How could you believe it?
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- Why doesn't he trust me?
- And most importantly with whom?
- With this monster, Samokhvalov.
- Of course, he's cute.
- And this after that was between us?
- Doesn't matter, you have two little girls !
- Do not worry, you will have a little boy !
- Go to hell !
- How could you?
- Dad?
What to do? Amir said that he loves me, the whole class heard it.
- Do you love him?
- No.
- We'll have to tell him about it. Only you need to choose words carefully, because he can be hurt.
- Then, I'll send back his wallet.
- Maybe also do I ...
- Tolia, and what happens?
- Nothing, I quit.
- Tolia, she hurt you?
- She 'raised' me, can you imagine ...
- Look, but God knows why one is fired, another is raised. But, can she afford it?
- Hello, comrades!
- Anatoly Yefremovich, there is not cold there? No?
