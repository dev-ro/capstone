Let me enter. I have come here today with a request.
Allow me to speak.
Another one?
Will it ever stop?
My liege, what is your bidding?
Where is Omodaka?
He must be present today.
Should I order his presence, my liege?
No.
It is of no consequence.
Let him in.
You are considering, my liege,
receiving this ronin (masterless samurai)?
We will listen to what he has to say.
I was told that you have come
to request use of my premises to commit seppuku?
I come from Geishu in Hiroshima,
where I served my former lord Fukushima Masanori.
My name is Tsukumo Hanshiro.
After the downfall of the clan,
I have been searching elsewhere for a servitude.
But my search remains in vain.
As such we currently live in times of great peace,
I could only lead a life full of hardship and poverty.
But I could no longer bear this shame.
I wish to die as a warrior by eviscerating myself.
For that reason I am before you
most humbly beseeching:
Allow me to fulfill my wish
on the grounds of your inner courtyard.
I have the highest respect for your sentiments.
As well as empathy.
I have heard that Fukushima-dono's subordinates have always
first and foremost ensured the safety of their lord
before they surrendered the fortress of Hiroshima to the enemy.
Thereby allowing the secession to proceed without conflict.
Truly an exemplary act of a samurai.
You served the Fukushima clan.
Are you acquainted with a young samurai
among the retainers named Chijiiwa Motome?
I do not know him.
He claimed as you do,
to have been once a retainer of the Fukushima clan.
The rice harvest amounted to 498,200 Koku yearly.
There were only 572 retainers and their subordinates.
And if the members of their households were to be included,
an uncountable number including myself
had to wander around aimlessly after the loss of their worth.
Indeed.
At the beginning of autumn he stood before our gates.
Chijiiwa Motome. A samurai warrior.
One who no longer serves a lord.
He came with the same request as you do now.
Would you like to hear his story?
That of his fate?
Please proceed, I am listening.
20th of October, Year 11 of KAN'EI (1634)
Please let me enter.
I have come here today with a request.
Please allow me to speak with your lord.
Someone has arrived.
Have you all seen him? How emaciated
and weak he appears before us! A masterless samurai.
It is of no consequence
wherever he takes his own life!
Especially when it concerns such a rowdy dog.
The bigger the house of the lord in which
a samurai dies, the greater is the honour
accorded to him in death.
- Should we just kill him?
No.
Give him a few coins and send him away,
before it becomes troublesome.
What do you think, Omodaka-dono?
Are you cold? Do you need anything else?
No.
How old is he?
He appears no more than twenty, my liege.
He is then younger than you.
This is undoubtedly another ruse,
pretending to request to commit seppuku.
The thought of it alone angers me
that such an unworthy person has knocked
on our clan's door for such a purpose.
- A ruse?
- Indeed, my liege.
It began with an impoverished Ronin
requesting permission to enter the house of Fujishima.
He said, "My life is unbearable. And
I wish to end it."
Allow me to end my wretched life
here and now upon your grounds.
The older samurai at the gates
were so deeply moved
and tried to dissuade him from his intention.
They introduced him into their ranks,
which then spread like wildfire in town.
As a consequence
Many masterless samurai request audience
at the houses of the great lords.
Some would be employed,
the others would be pacified with a few coins
at the very least in order to
save their honour.
What a disgraceful undertaking!
Many Ronin now believe that they would
receive some coins if they threatened
to commit seppuku. This man is
another one of them.
- Omodaka.
Do you really believe that this
man is playing a ruse?
Indeed.
We must make an example out of him.
Thereby deterring any more
from knocking on our door.
He is currently residing in the house.
It is for this reason that Iyi-dono
would grant you audience.
He will meet me personally?
Follow me to the baths. There you will receive
the attire with which you are to present yourself with.
Yes.
Come along and observe.
A truly rare event awaits us.
Watch carefully and observe attentively
what you are about to witness.
Yes.
Omodaka-dono.
Here are his swords.
Inspect them carefully.
With those he intended in all earnesty
to commit seppuku.
Put these on.
Thank you.
When you are done, proceed outside.
Just a moment! Wait!
Is something the matter?
Am I to meet Iyi-dono in funeral attire?
- Iyi-dono?
He had to leave the house suddenly
for an urgent matter.
Your desire has been presented to him.
He is thoroughly convinced that you
could not be dissuaded from your honourable decision.
For this reason he asked us
to make all the proper preparations to
fulfill your request.
I implore you.
Allow me some time!
What is the matter? Are you done?
Everything has been prepared.
You can now commit seppuku.
Just as you have requested.
How do you find it?
What do you think?
What happened afterwards?
My name is Saito Kageyo.
A subordinate of Iyi-dono.
This clan has been regarded highly
for the bravery we have shown in battle.
But very few remember today the great battles
of Sekigahara and Osaka.
Most of the men present here are samurai.
But none of them had once fought for their own lives.
They have no experience of battles.
The country is peaceful.
In peaceful times such as these
I am deeply moved by your request
to commit seppuku on our grounds,
as a great honour to our clan.
Let these young men bear witness
the unique death of a samurai
by committing seppuku.
I have assigned Omodaka Hikukoro
as your second.
Matsusaki Hayatonosho has been appointed
as the observer.
To the side is your assistant,
Kawabe Umanosuke.
I ask you: Are you prepared?
Please allow me another request.
That would be?
Please give me one day.
Just one day. No more.
I will return. You have my word.
- Leave it!
- Such pathetic whimpering!
- Just one day!
I will come back. You have my word.
Or even a few hours.
- I beg you.
- Spare yourself the trouble.
This house will not tolerate a ruse
feigning seppuku.
I am not feigning.
I swear to you, I will commit seppuku.
I beg you!
- Just one day!
- How could you even consider it?
Wait.
It is not that simple.
We have mobilised all our resources
in order to promise you your request will be fulfilled.
And we have kept our word.
You came to us with that request yourself.
Just like other clans, our house keeps
strictly to our rules.
A warrior never changes his mind.
Never.
Have you understood my meaning?
Or perhaps not?
I suggest,
you use your own sword for this purpose.
A truly impressive wakizashi (short shord).
Use mine.
- Stop!
- Do not risk it!
I beg you.
Give me three ryo.
I need a physician for my sick wife and child.
How dare you beg for money?
Have compassion. Just three. Three ryo.
And thus we hear your true request.
How shameful.
As a warrior of the Fukushima clan, I
Chijiwa Motome,
am committing hara-kiri and leaving this world.
Stab it and turn it to the side.
Do what I say.
Omodaka.
Second.
Turn it around, you coward.
- Do it!
- Turn it to the side!
More. Go on.
Come, turn it around!
A truly sad story you have told me.
Sad?
And?
Have you changed your mind?
Do you truly believe
that no one would find out? Disappear. Go.
I would in no way do such a thing.
A warrior never changes his mind.
On the contrary. I will honourably
commit seppuku.
Then so be it.
You should know what you are doing.
- You would need a new attire.
- No!
That which I now wear on my back is beffiting
for the last days of an impoverished Ronin.
A last word:
You have accorded me great respect.
And I do not know how I could show my
gratitude for such great honour.
Allow me if possible to express a final request.
I grant it to you. Speak.
My deepest gratitude.
I would like as my second
Omodaka Hikokuro.
That is all.
Omodaka?
His reputation precedes him.
He is considered one of the bravest retainers
in the house of Iyi.
Indeed.
He is indispensible.
Hikokuro!
Tell me, where is he?
I have not seen him.
He has taken leave of absence.
You heard him. Omodaka is absent today.
Ono will be your second. He too possesses
extraordinary skills.
No. My last wish shall not be denied.
No.
Bring him here.
I thank you, my liege.
- He did not return last evening?
- Indeed.
Go and search for him.
I hope he can justify his absence. Otherwise
there would be heavy consequences to deal with.
As you wish.
- Say, there are more samurai missing?
- Indeed, sir.
And I am told of it only now?
And?
Where is Omodaka-dono?
What is not, is not.
What is not, is not.
In the case of Omodaka-dono's absence,
I thereby request instead Matsusaki Hayato or
Kawabe Umanosuke as my second.
Both of them are also indisposed.
My men are searching for them.
How is that possible?
I do not understand.
That has never happened before. None of
the three returned last evening.
Feind!
What have you to do with it?
Wait.
I beg you. Please compose yourself for a moment.
For I would like to tell you something.
Something that you have to know.
Indeed, lend me your ears.
Afterwards you may tear me into pieces as you wish.
Step back!
Speak.
I will.
Chijiiwa Motome, who came to you two months ago,
is of some acquaintance to me.
We stood close together in reality, as you and I do now.
Chijiwa Motome
was of some acquaintance to me.
June, Year 3 of GENNA (1617).
Father?
I have to go back to the castle.
Father.
Miho.
Don't be afraid. Will you wait for me here alone?
A short break! Rest a while!
Chijiiwa-dono.
How far along are you with the repairs?
The outer wall can wait.
Most important is that the inner portion is
finally finished.
I agree
but without the permission of the Shogunate
my hands are regrettably bound.
We have already submitted it six months ago
to the Shogunate.
Be patient. Until then, just continue as you have.
For a few repairs
the Shogun would surely allocate nothing.
And if so, what then? We could not possibly
take such a risk.
If we break the bushido code, our clan will be dissolved.
That will not happen. Begin at least with the works
at the citadel.
No. We have to wait first for the permit.
We know that!
But it is our duty to guard the fortress.
- But
- Go to work, all of you.
- As you wish!
Chijiiwa-dono. What is wrong? Say something!
Shouldn't you be resting in bed?
It is a crime to be lying in bed on such a nice day.
Welcome.
What a huge melon!
Compared to yours my sword is a mere piece of iron.
Where did you acquire such a masterpiece?
It is a gift from our lord.
He has bestowed it to me after the Battle of Sekigahara.
Allow me a question.
I am slightly concerned.
The Shogun has yet to give us his permission
for the castle reparations.
I find it very suspicious.
Could it be a conspiracy?
One to destroy the clans which were once enemies?
- We have allied ourselves with him rather late.
- Hanshiro.
Please don't say such a thing.
Surely, that could be something true indeed.
But what use is it to be worrying about such things?
Enjoy the finest pleasures in life.
Jinnai-dono.
She looks more and more like your late wife.
Admit it. She is more important to you than your own life.
If one considers that we can't do anything else
in life outside of the battlefield,
and that we have both lost our wives,
we haven't done wrong with bringing up our
children, have we?
Motome has grown up to be a stately lad.
Only, unlike myself he seems to prefer reading and writing.
"The works on the fortress which have begun
without my permission
are considered to be a crime against
the code of the Samurai and thereby deemed illegitimate.
For this reason I have decreed with the threat of strict punishment,
June, Year 5 of GENNA (1619)
the aforementioned construction to be removed from site
and the entire fortress down to the inner citadel to be
destroyed immediately.
Disregard of my clear instructions and thereby insubordination
are an intolerable provocation
as well as an unforgivable insult to my person
and would therefore require the gravest of consequences.
Each of you are to immediately vacate the premises
and make way towards Tsugaru.
This is an order which every single one of you must obey.
The Shogun, EDO."
I am not worthy to be in charge of construction.
I should have gone to the Shogun to commit seppuku
So that the destruction of the fortress and the
dissolution of our clan could be prevented.
The Shogun promotes and disposes of men, just as he pleases.
Not once did his advisers contradict him.
What a shame.
Don't close your eyes.
Hanshiro
Rest assured.
If it comes to worst, I will take your son under my care.
Just like if he were my own.
Hanshiro.
Please forgive me.
Do not say such things.
Please open the door.
I'd like to see the fortress.
How beautiful and stately it is.
Indeed.
EDO, June, Year 6 of GENNA (1620)
It is just like with studies. Or with swordfighting.
When one
works hard everyday, he would sure make progress.
You two must not worry.
Aren't you eating, Father?
I have to go out for a while.
Then we will wait for you.
No. Go ahead. I am meeting with an acquaintance.
Go ahead. As long as it's still warm. Who knows?
Maybe the food tastes nice only when warm.
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.
We have no luck today.
I had hoped that we would catch a carp.
The books say that carps are good for weak people.
And especially for weak girls.
Hand it over! Grab the net!
Quick!
We can fry the carp and give it to Miho-dono!
Good.
What a grand house.
It belongs to Lord Iyi. We have allied ourselves with him
before the Battle of Sekigahara. And then drove the
enemy together towards retreat.
One day I would serve in such a house, and then
I would be able to repay the kindness Miho-dono and
Tsugumo-dono has shown me.
May, Year 7 of KAN'EI (1630)
He must marry Miho off.
Otherwise he would never
ever get an employment. Greetings, my child.
- Good day.
You're absolutely right.
He was there again. The director of merchant-house Koshuya.
Isn't that already his fifth visit?
But most probably the answer again this time is "no".
You have to finally get married, Miho-sama.
That would be greatly advantageous for your father.
We simple folk understand nothing about such things.
With Samurai is everything always complicated. Really.
Please excuse me.
I have returned, Father.
Father
I have made more today than I have expected.
You have brought over a lot of work.
Don't overdo it.
Father.
Do not concern yourself over nothing.
Father.
Rice cake.
Would you like a piece?
Go ahead and eat first, Father.
I will eat mine later.
A delicacy loses its taste when eaten alone.
Thank you, sir. Goodbye, sir.
To confess the truth:
I had been worried about this thin roof
and I am at a loss at what to do.
- I am greatly honoured by your visit.
Ah, do not be.
I have not seen you in a long while, Motome-dono.
I am deeply thankful to you
For using this hut for such a purpose.
- I thank you
For all the kindness you have bestowed upon me.
- Yes, yes.
That is for you alone. I have already eaten one with Father.
A delicacy loses its taste when eaten alone.
What? What is so funny?
I shall pour some hot water.
Uncle.
What has led you here?
Thank you.
Since when have you been collecting stray cats?
Something is bothering you, Uncle.
Could you perhaps imagine marrying Miho?
Miho.
Is that possible for you?
I have no employment.
It is not yet possible for me to take on a wife.
Feelings are all that counts. What do you feel for Miho?
I will...
For Miho-dono, I will give up my life to protect her.
- You would?
- Yes!
Upon my word.
Motome. Your words do you honour.
What counts is only what your heart tells you.
Understood? Only that matters.
Father!
Give him to me. You are getting heavier and heavier.
Miho. The food is ready.
I'm coming.
Our gratitude, Father. For giving us this splendid fish.
It is of no consequence. Forgive me, that is isn't much bigger.
- It is huge!
Don't exaggerate.
Thank you, Father. We do not know, for which we have
earned it.
What's there to know? He is after all my grandson.
Don't be so formal.
So, Kingo, here we have your first time eating solid food.
And now open your mouth!
Here.
Open your mouth!
How about some fish, Kingo?
Not for you? Try it.
Kingo!
Now let us eat.
Yes.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You come later.
I must be gone. I am currently helping
in the temple school of an acquaintance.
Go ahead. And take care of yourself.
Don't stay too long outside.
What is the matter?
You have always been sickly as a child.
I hope that doesn't get any worse.
Take care of yourself.
Father.
Please do not be concerned. I am fine and healthy.
Like a fish in water.
Miho.
Stop trying to deceive me.
When you need help, just let me know.
Understood?
Yes.
- That is tantamount to extortion.
- Yes.
Furthermore directly in front of the house!
How horrible. You are right.
That is improper.
Tsugumo-sama.
What is the matter?
I would not like to keep you.
But are you perhaps acquainted with the samurai
who lives over there?
The young one? Apparently he had feigned Seppuku.
Feigned Seppuku?
Indeed. It is now in trend. Have you heard nothing of it?
- No.
It would never have occured to us simple folk
in our dreams.
Let alone in real life!
A samurai requests audience at a lord's house,
asking to use the premises to commit harakiri.
Even though he had no intention to at all!
One hopes for charity.
The real trick however is bringing the lords
into a compromising situation.
Miho.
Welcome home.
What happened?
Nothing.
The cat is there again.
It has come home after a long time.
I see.
It came home to die.
It is lying there as usual.
As if in sleep.
Go in. I will do it.
Miho!
Miho
I am fine.
Could you pay more for that?
They are unfortunately worth not much more.
unlike those which you wear on your belt.
I would gladly buy those swords.
How dare you?
Sadly there is nothing else I can do.
Wait.
Three pieces for you. Thank you very much.
Fresh eggs!
Fresh eggs! Eggs! Fresh eggs!
- Come get me!
- You'll get it!
Forgive me.
You need not apologize. Rest.
That was not necessary.
You need not worry. Take your medicine.
And eat something. That would do you good.
Lie down.
I will bring you to a physician.
He would make you healthy again.
A physician? We definitely would not be
able to afford one.
I am but a burden to you. Please forgive me.
It is a man's duty to provide for
his wife and child.
Do you understand?
You and I, we're two halves of a whole.
Do not concern yourself with unnecessary matters.
Everything will be better. Believe me.
Try to sleep.
"Pawnshop"
Thank you.
That would be 50 Mon.
I am feeling much better today.
You have to take it easy.
Father.
How ever could I thank you?
You need not thank me, Miho. Rest.
Understand? Sleep a little.
Please take care of yourself, Father.
Living alone as you are.
Do not worry about me.
Please forgive me, for giving you so much trouble.
Father.
Motome.
Forgive me.
What for?
- What do you speak of, Father?
- Motome.
Forgive me.
I could not do anything.
Miho will get better.
I am convinced of it.
Yes.
Indeed, she will. You are right. Motome.
I will do everything in my power.
The fever has not subsided for three days.
He is very hot. We must fetch a physician.
I have already gone to him.
But he demands three Ryo in advance.
Three Ryo?
Three Ryo.
Three Ryo.
Three Ryo.
Three Ryo.
Motome.
How do we get our hands on so much money?
Father.
Would you please stay here and take care of
Miho and Kingo for me?
Leave everything to me.
What do you have in mind?
Rest assured. I will be back in the afternoon.
Be in haste. We must not lose too much time.
Yes.
Kingo.
Hang in there.
Kingo.
You must not give up.
Miho!
Kingo.
Are you hungry? Come!
Kingo.
Drink.
Kingo.
- Why would you not drink?
- Miho.
- Kingo.
- Stop this instant.
Leave him.
Miho.
Stop, Miho!
Your breastmilk will only be detrimental to him
at your current state. Set him down.
Miho!
Put him back down!
Why is Motome taking so long? He should have
been back by now.
Are you all right?
Kingo.
Wait.
Drink.
Drink up, Kingo!
You are the son of a samurai. Drink!
Come.
I beg you.
Drink something.
Miho?
Miho
Come.
Miho.
Lie down.
Why is Motome not back yet?
Kingo!
Kingo!
Kingo!
Kingo!
Hang on! Kingo. Open your eyes! Kingo.
Come on, wake up! Wake up! Kingo. Wake up!
Kingo!
- Kingo!
- Kingo!
Kingo!
Lie down.
Do you hear, Kingo? Open your eyes!
Wake up!
- Open your eyes, Kingo.
- Kingo!
Kingo!
Kingo!
Wake up. I beg you. Open your eyes.
Please!
Please!
Kingo!
Stop, Father!
Forgive me. I hope it didn't hurt.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Father.
It is my fault.
It is my fault.
- Forgive me, Father!
- It is no fault of yours!
- Forgive me, Father.
- Miho! It is not your fault.
- Forgive me, Father.
- No one is blaming you!
- Forgive me, Father.
- No one!
No one is blaming you!
Is it Motome?
Motome is back.
Is this the residence of Chijiiwa Motome-dono?
Forgive us, sir. We are servants from the house of Iyi.
Chijiiwa-dono asked for permission to enter our gates
this morning, in order to commit seppuku.
We have given him our inner courtyard for his purpose.
Seppuku?
Please take this as condolence.
We must go. Our task is done.
Wait.
Wait!
Wait! Please wait!
Tell me quickly, how Motome passed away!
- He committed Seppuku.
- He would never do that!
Our only duty is
to return your his corpse.
- I believe none of it!
Tell me the truth!
- Tell me what happened!
- It has been decided in our house
that feigned seppuku will no longer be tolerated.
Feigned?
Wait! Please wait!
Stay!
At first we thought our superiors would prohibit it.
Tell me everything. I want to know how Motome died.
Forgive me. I know nothing.
Tell me!
Here, eat.
It's delicious.
Motome pawned his sword
in order to save the lives of his family.
My sword is for me the most revered object.
I would never give it to anyone.
The life of a samurai depends exceptionally
on the unforeseeable changes of destiny.
That which either bring him to fame or towards downfall.
It is simply that way.
Motome could have very well been one of you.
And one of you could have very well
suffered his very same tragic fate.
But even though he found himself in such
a difficult situation,
and that it is undoubtedly reprehensible
and unforgiveable to feign seppuku
in order to take advantage from it,
The request to commit Hara-kiri
with a bamboo sword is mocked
while your house is praised for hosting
such a ritualistic suicide.
No one here understands with what courage
he drove that bamboo sword into his flesh,
in order to bring attention to the agony
eating away at him and his family.
I empathize with your pain.
He could not be dissuaded.
Despite every objection he insisted on committing hara-kiri.
Therefore we provided him our inner courtyard for his purpose.
It was his mistake to think that he would not have
to act on his words till the end.
A warrior must kill himself
once he has committed his word to it.
According to the code, indeed.
But had you no sympathy for a man
who in his desperation stooped so low as to come to you
and beg for charity for his sick wife and child?
Were you so indifferent to this man's fate?
Is there no one among the warriors here present
who has enough compassion in themselves
to put themselves in Motome's position?
Has your stable employment in this lord's house made
all of you blind?
We have accorded him all the respect a warrior deserves.
You speak of compassion? He would not be discouraged.
Is a warrior also not a man with blood flowing through his veins?
Tsugumo-dono.
We have been forced to teach a lesson to deter others.
And he was the unfortunate one.
Every man has his honour. And a man without honour is no one.
When he lacks the heart and courage to keep his honour,
he has lost his worth as a man.
Yes, indeed.
Each of our warriors have such a heart.
You claim that none of your men fears death?
Just because they as samurai possess honour?
And that they would sacrifice their life to
maintain this honour?
It is as you say.
Tsugumo-dono.
There is nothing left to be said.
The three of them have not been sighted since
they left their quarters last evening. There
are no traces of them.
- You have yet to find them?
- Indeed, sir.
- Go and search further.
- As you wish.
What has happened to my men?
Take these back.
It is of no worth to me any more.
I have something else. Something which
would like you to have.
Matsusaki Hayatonosho's topknot.
Kawabe Umanosuke's topknot.
And Omodaka Hikokuro's topknot.
You could return these, if you so desire,
to the missing men.
Without their topknots your three warriors
fear treading outside, where people could see them.
The head is still intact. But the face has been lost.
Who are you?
Who are you? State your name!
Chijiiwa Motome. Does that mean anything to you?
They are ashamed that instead of their lives
only their topknots have been taken from them.
Since then they have hidden themselves from the world
and dare not leave their hole.
You spoke of honour. What of it?
Of a samurai's honour?
As all of you could see, that honour you speak of is nothing at all.
Meaningless! Nothing but a farce!
Your honour is but a farce.
Kill him.
Whoever speaks of honour should know
that it is not something that a samurai puts on the line.
- Silence!
Have you lost your mind?
Do you really believe that I have lost my mind?
I have only lived
every year waiting for spring.
You bastard!
Father!
Get inside!
We have found them!
We have restored everything to its proper place.
Just as you have ordered.
Has it been thoroughly polished?
Indeed.
The red armour
is the pride of our noble house.
