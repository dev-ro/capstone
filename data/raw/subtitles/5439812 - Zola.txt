You wanna hear a story about how
me and this bitch here fell out?
It's kinda long,
but it's full of suspense.
You could taste
that shit
before he walked
through the door.
It was fart. It was egg.
It was nasty.
What you call it again when
their skin get red like that?
- Rosacea?
- Yup. I saw that shit on TV.
Why it get like that?
Gracias.
Here we go.
I'll get you some ketchup.
I didn't like that place.
There was just
something about it.
It had the wrong air flow.
- I didn't tell you?
- Mmm-mmm.
It was like
the energy was off.
What table am I at?
Thanks, guys.
The closer you are to the
city, the prettier the girls.
I don't make the rules.
Hormones in the food help out
hormones in the water.
Chicken taste
like real chicken.
- Nah, that ain't chicken.
- Right.
- Y'all got jalapeno poppers?
- We don't.
So I met
this white bitch at my job.
I was her waitress.
She came in with this
old-ass, big-ass Black dude.
Damn, bitch,
you got perfect titties!
I wish I had titties
like that.
They look just like
little apples.
Thank you.
So you just gonna pull
that dyke shit
right in front of me
and not include me?
You so dumb.
Like, why you so dumb?
Every one of my tables
is Fruit Loops.
You said it, not me.
I'm tired.
I'm gonna take a break.
Girl...
I feel like we met.
- When?
- I don't know. You dance?
- Sometimes.
- I dance.
- Okay, bitch, me too.
- Cute.
You're not supposed
to be back here.
- What you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
You wanna go somewhere with me?
Same bitch that won't dance
for money
be the same bitch that
be out on the block.
Same bitch that wanna smile
in your face
be the same bitch that
gonna come for you later.
- Period!
- On, God!
On, God!
Like, why you on my Twitter?
Why you on my Facebook?
Why you on my Tumblr?
Why are you DM-ing me?
- Sis, why you tagging me on photos?
- Sis!
- You don't even fuck with me.
- Sis!
- Lemme know! Lemme know!
- Sis.
- Lemme...
- Yeah, sis!
You gonna get that?
She looks like you.
You think so?
I think she looks
like her daddy.
He got a lazy eye, though.
I hope she don't get that.
You got kids?
Time to go.
I'm hungry.
Put your number in.
You got my Twitter,
my Tumblr and my Facebook.
Follow for follow,
bitch.
Ay.
Hey, you wanna play this?
Come on, jump on it.
Oh. Shit, man!
I don't feel
like cooking tonight.
Where you wanna go?
You want me to choose?
Have you heard
anything I said?
Yo, why you looking at me
like that?
Yo, am I missing
something here?
Hey.
Last month I went dancing
at this cute spot in Florida
where my roommate's girl
made like 5 Gs a night.
My roommate just told me
that he going
down there tomorrow
and he asked me
if I had any friends
that wanna make some money
and you the first bitch
I thought of.
Damn, bitch!
We just met yesterday
and you already trying
to take ho trips together?
When we leaving?
Be ready by 2:00.
Who's all going?
Be ready by 2:00!
Who's all going?
Me, my boyfriend,
and my roommate.
Last time I was there,
I met a rapper who had a song
on the radio.
Hey, who is that?
Text me your address.
You just dropped me off
the other night.
You think I remember, bitch?
I don't know
where I am right now.
I'm gonna have to fuck
my nigga calm.
Cute.
Yo, what's that look
on your face?
I'm going to Florida to dance.
Since when?
Did I ever say anything
to make you stop dancing?
You've been
trained to know better.
Oh, so, I'm trained?
When a man
don't have anything to say
about the way you make
your money, he don't like it.
So, what if I don't?
You know I'm working
on getting a better job.
Mmm-hmm.
- You like that?
- I do.
I'mma go to Florida
with this white girl I met
and we gonna dance.
- Good?
- Good.
- Are you close?
- No!
Okay. Whoo!
Hey, bitch!
This is gonna be so fun.
- It's my bitch, Zola.
- Hey, bitch Zola.
It'll be 48 hours
till I know this nigga's name.
Baby bitch Zola.
It's gonna be so fun.
- That's my purse.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.
- Thank you.

I was like...
Like, "What?" Like, "Huh?"
Like, this dookie-ass bitch
with a nappy-ass head

I was like, "Look, if you
gonna slide up and down
"a pole all night in some
doo-do-ass drawers,
"clean your butt! Like, have

"'cause nobody lookin' to get
Giardia on account of no ho!"
Like, not again!
Then this bitch was up
in my face!
I was like,
"Look, booger bitch,
"best get your ghetto ass
up out my face."
"It's not my fault you nasty!
"It's not my fault I make
more money than you!"
- "Clean your butt!"
- "It's not my fault you nasty!
"It's not my fault
- "I make more money than you!"
- "Clean your butt!"
On God!
Turn that shit

- Word.
- Yeah!
- Yo! Derrek.
- What's this?
A little spot,
just for a couple of hours.
- All of us?
- Thought you was tired.
- I'm not tired.
- You look tired.
I guess I'm tired.
You already look pretty.
Baby.
You know they filmed
Miami Vice around here?
Mmm-mmm.
- You remember that movie?
- I don't.
- Well, you've seen it.
- Look at those lips.
You like it?
You don't think it's too pink?
- Mmm-mmm. I wanna lick them.
- Okay, chill.
- Yo, yo...
- My bad. My bad.
Take care of your own shit.
So, we get to Florida
and show up
at this nasty motel.
Don't worry
about the smell.
Ain't nothing a little
air freshener can't handle.
We gonna be
at the club all night.
This room for Derrek.
Do not trip.
Don't trip.
Yo. Yo, I'm not trying
to stay here, for real.
Hey, hey, hey.
I don't wanna see your face
like that.
You only gotta be here till they
get done with what they gotta do.
Our room's not ready.
What can I do?
I'm not a hotel.
I can't make it ready.
- I got that.
- It don't make any sense
putting a bunch of money
into a room
you gonna be in all alone.
You're not gonna like that.
So...
We save money today...
What?
...and get to the pool
and the pina coladas tomorrow.
Exactamente. Yeah, um...
But can I just come
with you guys to the club?
Nigga, what did
I just tell you?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
It's not so bad, is it?
Yo, it kinda is.
We'll be back soon.
Whose is that?
Yours.
And whose is this?
Mine.
Mmm.
Gonna make me throw up.
Yo, I'm hungry.
You need all your bags?
Which one you really need?
Just this one.
Okay, I'll leave this one

Okay, what's the deal

We cool.
Well, he used

Mmm, "take care of me" in
stripper language means he is her pimp.
I am not here for that.
He just take care of me,
that's all.
Okay. Too vague.
He'll be here in 30.
Girl.
I can take that one, too.
Be right back.
- Hey, bitch.

My friend just told me there's
a spot we could go dancing,
but you gotta

- Why?
- Well, 'cause he gonna ask.
Ask what?
You'll see.
We'll see.
Nope.
What y'all make?
Nothing.
My other girl

Y'all wanna trap?
What you got for us?
I set y'all both up on Backpage.
Backpage is where
you buy and sell sex.
Bitch, strike two.
Ooh. Good looking out.
Yous about to get you some.
You know I gotcha, girl.
Okay, wait, wait,

These are pictures we just

It's been real. I'm out.
Hey!
Shut the fucking door, bitch!
Where the fuck

Nigga, where the fuck

Get your ass

before I put your ass
back in this car!
I picked you up at your house.
I know where you live.
I know where you work.
Next time you fix up
your mouth to talk to me,

Close my fucking door.
Bitch.
Put your seat belt on.

You have me out here thinking

While I bide my time to make the
real money ass up, face down.
Girl... Listen.
No shade, no shame, do you.
But that is not what you told
me I was coming out here to do!
You gonna hit me?
What the fuck

This is messy! You are messy!
Your brain is broke!
Have fun, be safe,

I didn't mean to bring you

So, are you trying to eat?
Uh, 'cause I can wait,

All right.
So let me know. All right,

Nothing

All you gotta do

He ain't gonna force you

Oh, bitch, I know he's not.
There's a guy on his way up.
I'ma stay here till I can get my
bag from that nasty-ass motel.
Okay.

Say hello. Make them feel welcome.

I appreciate your confidence
in me, but I came to dance.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're done with that.
Oh, well, in that case,

She just, uh...

I... I'd give her a lung...
Not a heart. Uh...
A kidney, like, whatever.
- If she...
- Were you homeschooled?
Why?
You think I'm stupid?
- I look stupid.
- What do I look like?
I'm sorry, Zola.
Oye, bro, mandaron dos!
Your man said
it was 200 each for head,
400 each for a gang bang.
- He never said that.
- No, he said that.
- When you talk to him?
- Before.
I don't set the price.
You know what,
I'm actually good
on the gang bang, okay?
I'm easy.
I'm fine with some head.
Yo, I was hoping
I could get butt.
She don't do that.
- We savages, miss.
- We ain't proper.
Look, you know what,
I'm good...
Y'all wanna hear a story
about why me
and this bitch fell out?
It's long,
but I'ma speed it up.
And action.
We meet at the restaurant
she work at.
I was with
my community leader, Jonathan.
This very ratchet
and very Black woman
comes to take our order.
And listen, I know that they supposed
to be flirtatious and everything,
but not like she was.
I'm a Christian. I fear God.
So we exchanged numbers.
The next day, she called me
and she's like,
"I'm a ex dancer. I'm broke.
I need welfare."
And I told her, I don't fuck
with that life no more,
and she's like,
"Well, who do you fuck with?"
I was like, "I fuck with
Jesus, my Lord and savior."
I told her that my good
friend Abegunde Olawale,
who a promoter in Tampa,
had invited me
and my boyfriend to Tampa
to be his guests
for the weekend.
And she was like,
"Let me dance at the club
he promote at."
And I was like,
"Is that how that works?
"'Cause I don't know
how that work."
In Tampa, the club don't let
her dance 'cause she dirty.
But everybody loved me.
Reason to be a jealous bitch
number one.
So she takes
all these pictures
and she pops off
a Backpage ad.
And I was like, "Backpage ad?"
Like, what is that?
At the hotel,
I stay with her
because I'm worried
about her safety.
She wasn't getting any calls,
so she puts my picture up with her
picture, and she ain't even ask.
I was very put off.
Nobody liked her.
She made $1.
Everybody loved me.
Reason to be
a jealous bitch number two.
I'm not resisting you.
I just wanna go home.
I'm not fighting!
I'm not fighting!
Stop fighting
and get on the ground!
I can't! I can't!
- Fucking nigger!
- I can't!
I can't! I can't!
I just wanna go home!
Put your hands
behind your back!
Help! Help!
Put your hands
behind your back!
Put your hands
behind your back!
Help me! Help! Help!
$5,000
for two bitches.
Client wants two.
$2,000 for one.
Last one.
- You cold?
- A little.
Let's just go.
You don't gotta do this.
You got a little money
on you right now.
You can stretch that out.
Who is it?
In-call.
Shut the fuck up,
bitch!
All right. Take the car
and go home, all right?
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
You know I'd kill
for you, right?
Yeah, I know you would.
- We gotta call the cops.
- No, we go up and we get her.
- We got nothing to do with this shit!
- Yes!
- Let's go!
- Oh, we don't? How the fuck
do I know you ain't in
on this shit?
- I'm not.
- Oh, yeah?
Then how the fuck did you get
out and she got all hemmed up?
You were supposed to be
looking out for her, Zola.
You were supposed to be
looking the fuck out for her!
- Who's looking out for me?
- You still got that piece?
Get over here.
Who is it?
Motherfucker,
you know who this is.
- I want my bitch.
- Which bitch?
- My bitch.
- I been all over Tampa,
and I ain't met a bitch
named "My" yet.
You want me to let you in
while you flashing that
fucking gun in my face?
Oh!
Guess who opens
the door?
The nigga Derrek was doing magic
with at that nasty-ass motel.
- Yo, I thought we were homies!

- Turn around.
- This isn't you!
Man, put your shit

Come on. Pick your shit up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up, motherfucker!
- Come on. You're good.

You got some pretty ass eyes.
No, thank you.
Why is this bitch

What did y'all
do to her?
Where is she?
- Just give her back!
- Hey. Hey.
Don't move that fucking fast

Look, y'all don't know me,
I don't know y'all,
but don't start getting
delusions of motherfucking gander
when niggas is pointing guns

God damn it!
Y'all stressing me out!
I'm trying to be
a hospitable host.
Brother, I understand.
I don't know how they do shit
where you from,
but where I'm from,
you don't just jump
in another man back yard
and pull your pants down
and start pissing and shitting
wherever the fuck you want to.
I get you.
So, I get 20 grand
for the bitch,
and guess what?
All is forgiven.
Twenty grand?
That bitch can pull in
20 grand on a weekend
by her goddamn self.
Fact. That's why
she don't belong to you.
Zola, stand up.
Zola, stand up.
- Zola!
- I dare you!
Try it in this bitch
and I'mma bust your ass!
Fifty grand.
Fifty grand. Hey.
Fifty grand. Fifty grand.
And you can keep this,

Look at this shit.
Look at this shit.
Now, give it a taste.
Taste it.

Yo, put your fingers in.

Taste it, brother.
There we go.

You like that?
Yeah, that shit

Mmm.

- Yeah, that's it.
Better.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
Oh, shit.
Hey, drop your gun,

There must be a fucking
grand misunderstanding
going on in this...

Drop your gun.
And tell your boy to drop
