Put some effort. lt won't kill you.
God will take care of the rest.
Narayana Murthy. lt's

The inspector's dress that we..

The assistant director

Get him ready fast. lt's him.
Are you the inspector?
- Yes. - Come fast.
You know cycling, don't you?

You don't know? Why didn't

Uncle Subbaiyya! Listen,

l can ride the cycle. l can ride it.
Ok, get ready fast.
- You can? - Yes, l can.
You can ride a cycle? Are you sure?
Hey, you!

Handcuff this old lady and put

Come downstairs.
Mother.

Sir. Sir. - Greetings,
sir. - l hope you remember me.
l am Anand from Surabhi company.
- l see.
Please come, they
are waiting for you.
He came from a drama company..
..and played some
minor roles in movies.
His mother works as a
maid in a number of houses..
..to support him. lf
you recommend his name..
Hey, close that door.
lt's not a hockey stick,
it's a sword, you know that?
You know what is this?
- l know.
l know how to hold a sword.
l learnt it from great masters.
Since ten years l have been..
Hero's chance..
- Mr. Narshimham.
You lost the chance to be a hero.
He has courage in the heart.
He has that aggression.
He's our picture's hero.
ln a country where one has
to beg for a child's milk..
..when will people stop
wasting milk for the stones?
l wonder when the people
who worship the cow-dung..
..will change and identify the poor.
You are writer
Samara Suryam, aren't you?
When will there be a
revolution in the country?
lsn't it our responsibility
to bring that revolution?
l like the language
you use very much..
..but l can't agree
with your viewpoint.
l guessed it the moment l saw you.
White silk. lt's the native
white man's greed to rule.
Beads. Our people know
nothing about science.
lf you ask them what's
Yama's transportation..
..they will say a male buffalo.
A garland for cattle and
the same garland for human.
That is also bearable.
But ash on forehead?
- You call Vibhudi mere ash?
And God?
- He doesn't exist.
And he whom we see in the temple?
- lt's a stone.
The Vedas?
- They fool you.
The theory of Shastra?
- Superstition.
Tying nuptial thread in the wedding?
ls turning a woman into a slave.
- And the band in wedding?
lt's something a
worthless person does.
And what do you
think about the dot..
..that woman put on their
foreheads? - lt's foolishness.
Great. Great. Great.
You are applauding my
language or my viewpoint?
None of them. lt's
for my good fortune.
Your language and my acting!
What would be the result, ..
..if the sharpness of your
words and the sharpness..
..of my sword unite?
lf you could write..
..such beautiful dialogues
for movies. lf that happens..
..the audience will be
deceived by the words..
..and they would
accept me as a lead actor.
Do l look like a deceiver?
- Which other writer..
.. has the power to
mesmerize people..
..with such beautiful
interweaving of words.
ls this lead actor in
movies a dear friend of mine..
..or a respected enemy?
For the time being l
am just an admirer.
He who gave you a lotus-like face..
..who gave you a rose-like body..
..who gave you jasmine-like teeth..
..who gave you marigold-like ears..
He who made your body
with different flowers..
..made your heart with a stone?
- Cut.
Ok. Take 3.
- l wanted the moonlight..
..but l got Amavashya(the
night of lunar eclipse).
l wanted freedom, but
you made me a prisoner.
l wanted melody, but
you gave me silence.
l wanted the nectar of love,
but you gave me a pot of tears.
l wanted a wax like heart in you..
..but you gave me thorns in return.
- Cut.
l waited till the moonlight leaves..
..and left when you were asleep..
But when l was back
to give you my heart..
..you left me all alone.
l kept the gates
of my chamber open..
..but the gentle
breeze remained outside.
l kept both my arms open..
..but you closed the
gates of your heart.
Like the salt thrown
out by the waves..
..you discarded my love.
- Cut.
That was great.
- Excellent.
That was wonderful.
- Great, Anand!
You did it really well.
There's no stopping you now.
Anand, my boy, you
have a great future.
Mark my words.
Come on. Come on. Move it.
- How was it?
The brightest star
of the movie-world.
lt's because of your words.
lt's because of you.
l say democracy. l say freedom.
l say we shall fight for
the freedom of this country.
Who wants freedom? Who wants it?
ln the nation where we are born..
..we are being treated as
untouchables, as outcasts..
..and as the slaves to
the rich and mighty..
..and in spite of having
intellects and scholars..
..when will our
suppressed society get freedom?
When will we get it?
Who should rule this country?
Who should rule it?
lt's you. Our countrymen,
but not the white man.
We have to put an
end to the atrocities..
..meted out on us in our own
country. We have to stop it.
The people of this country
who are in deep slumber..
..must wake up and get
ready for the battle.
lf the principles, of
other parties are wrong..
..what would you have done
if you were in their place?
lf the reigns of this country
were given into your hands..
..and if you were made
the king, the minister..
..if you were given all
the powers of this country..
..then what would you have done?
We haven't launched our party yet.
Ask that question after we
launch it. Wait till then.
lf you are really given
the reigns in your hand..
..and asked to rule
what would you do then?
l will change everything.
- What?
First of all we have to fix a
certain criteria to enter politics.
The rich shouldn't
enter the politics.
The prosperity that the
white men and the rich..
..brought for the
poor is not needed.
All the problems will be
solved if the rich are thrown out?
Caste.
We have been treated like slaves..
..in the name of being untouchables.
We must enter the cabinet.
Landlords shouldn't be there.
Every individual must be free.
There shouldn't be any slavery.
The practice of ministers
treating the policemen..
..as their pawns
should be eradicated.
Corruption must be
completely wiped out.
Power. Authority.
Position. lt's a responsibility..
..but not a weapon.
There should be no poverty.
lt must be eliminated forever.
No one should die of hunger.
Everyone should live happily.
Everyone should live happily.
We will establish a new society.
We must protect dharma.
l am proud of my friend.
These dreams
shouldn't remain just dreams.
They must come true.
Till they are realized..
..we can't sleep in peace. l'll
be there. l'll be there with you.
Suryam.
What happened? What happened?
Politics.
- Rascals!
Suryam, sir's here.
Don't get up. Don't
get up. Don't get up.
You are the real power right now.
To be a superpower,
return healthy and hale.
This is just the beginning.
There are many more
hurdles, hardships..
..and obstacles waiting
for us. What do you say?
To fight them all you
must gather the courage..
..and develop mental and
physical strength, Suryam.
A person like you is of
utmost importance now.
To achieve our goals,
to realize our dreams..
..to shed the blood
and to make sacrifices..
..a person like you is needed now.
Suryam, get well and come to us.
What's this! A person is
lying in a critical condition..
..and instead of asking
him about his condition..
..he is asking you to get up
and get your other leg broken.
l have to go to see the match.
l wonder what they will say.
With this face, you want to marry?
Let me see.
- O mother!
Anand. Anand, look here.
Tell me the truth
about why we came here.
How many times do l
have to tell you..
..that l got a telegram,
that mother is not well?
So you got a telegram in that form?
But l got it in this form.
This is sister Annamma
writing to brother Kashi.
On the next Wednesday morning..
..Anand and Pushpalu's..
..wedding is fixed.
You must come here along
with your family and give..
..the couple your blessings.
Your sister, Annamma.
l am going back. l am
going back by the next train.
l'll break your legs.
- What's going on!
Everyone's making a fool out of me.
Look, it's my responsibility
to hand you over to your mother.
lt's my responsibility.
l can't come.
Leave my shirt. l'll forget
that you are elder than me.
Leave my shirt. Give and take
respect. - Hold that as well.
Leave my shirt. Do
you think l am kid?
Annamma, your son's
here. Get up. Get up.
As l told you.. Lord! O lord!
l am not marrying anyone. l
am leaving by the next train.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You are making garlands here?
No one is getting
married here. Get up. Get up.
Don't get up. Don't get up.
- You think l don't have a voice?
You think just because l
listen to everything you say..
..l am not a man?
Who gave approval to this marriage?
First of all take a bath
and then go and see the girl.
lf you don't like her you
can leave by the next train.
Did you take dowry?
You sold me for dowry?
l won't force you to
marry someone you don't like.
lf you don't like her, l
will really not force you.
Then what's the rush for?
Why did you fool me and
called me here in this way?
Just because your son
hasn't started earning yet..
..it won't matter if
that girl has crooked eyes..
..crooked nose, or crooked feet?
l am asking you for the last
time what do you want to say?
l am asking you.
What do you want to say?
l accepted this
match without asking you.
lt's my fault. l didn't ask
them to stop the wedding..
l assured them that
my son would come..
..and that he won't
go against my wish.
lf you say no now l will
have to go back to them..
..and l will have to ask
them to stop everything.
Tell me what you say now.
l haven't even shaved yet.
- l will do it.
ln order to get my
approval you will have to..
That means he has agreed.
Only if you agree to what l say..
- Tell me what it is.
Let me talk for a moment.
Mr. Sundarayya and Mrs.
Parvatamma's son..
..Samara Suryam is
getting married to..
..Mr. Chandrayya and Mrs.
lndiramma's daughter..
..Manikyam. l now
pronounce you man and wife.
l, Mr. Sundarayya and
Mrs. Parvatamma's son..
..accept Mr. Chandrayya and
Mrs. lndiramma's daughter..
Manikyam.
- ..Miss. Manikyam as my wife.
l, Mr. Chandrayya and Mrs.
lndira's daughter..
..accept Mr. Sundarayya
and Mrs. Parvatamma's son..
..him as my husband.
The newlywed couple..
- ..may have joy and prosperity.
The newlywed couple..
Pushpa.
l want to talk to you.
How do l talk to you
if you turn that way?
l am listening to you.
l am listening to you.
You know how this
wedding took place?
Tell me.
- Against your wish.
And you? lt was
against your wish as well?
Tell me.
l will tell you tomorrow.
What if l leave you and go away?
- You won't leave.
Why?
- l will tell you.
Tell me.
You fell in love with me.
l fell in love with this face?
Yes, l fell in love, but
don't tell this to anyone.
l told everyone about it.
- O my God!
l am not an infant who drinks milk.
l am your husband who
wants to share your dreams..
..and your innermost thoughts.
Leave your innocence
behind and come to me..
..without any inhibitions.
What's that drama? - Mother
asked me to touch your feet.
Didn't your mother tell
you that men and women..
..both are equal?
lf you touch my feet l will also
have to touch your feet, right?
You shouldn't say that.
- What else should l say?
Shall l tell you a poem?
Shall l tell you about love?
Shall l teach you lullabies?
lt's your wish. - No, dear.
Your wishes are important.
Your desires are important.
Your sensuality is important.
Tell me what your wishes are.
- O God! l don't know.
Why do you invite
God to the bedroom?
Oh no!
Manikyam. Be careful.
lt's not an auspicious day.
- Why isn't it auspicious?
lt's the first night
and my sari got burnt..
What's the need for
these separations, dear?
lt's not fire that burnt
the sari on your body..
..but it's the fire of separation.
Yes, the fire of
separation that can burn down..
..your husband, my beloved one.
Not just beauty, but it
seems that you have got..
..a bit of intelligence as well?
- Yes, l have.
What are you wishes?
He must be a good person.
- Am l not a good person?
No matter how good a person he is..
..he should never change.
- And what if l change?
l'll push you.
- How?
, ,
ln this way.

They are a newlywed
couple. That's why..

Mr. Narsingh.
- Greetings, sir.
Please change your hand.
Please think about it for everyone.
- l can't. l can't.
What happened?
- Go and see there. You'll know it.
What happened, brother?
- They bought rail-tickets..
..for everyone. The
accountant is waiting for you. Go.
What happened?
- Sign the form..
..and take the salary
and rail ticket with you.
The movie has been stalled.
There is no other way.
Only God can help us.
Settle everything there.
Director sir, everyone is saying
that the movie has been stalled.
ls it true? Whose mistake is it?
ls it mine? ls it because l
didn't act well? - No, no, young man.
They have got some
financial problems.
After they are cleared..
- Please don't say that, sir.
This is the first film l
am working as a lead actor.
lf it is stalled in this way,
my career will be ruined, sir.
More than half of the movie is shot.
And if it stops now..
Let's do one thing, sir.
l don't want any salary.
l will give you back
the money l got till now.
l will convince everyone, sir.
Don't pay anyone till
the movie is completed.
Let's start it again somehow, sir.
Sir, tell me if l need
to do something else.
l tried my best to
convince the producer.
He said he can't shoot
the movie now. l'm sorry.
Anand, you are a saint.
Don't give up.
l'm sure you have a great future.
What can you do if
this was in my destiny!
lt's my fate.
Velu, start the car.
Sir has to leave.
No matter whatever has happened..
..l will never forget you, sir.
Goodbye.
Under Mr. Jai
Prakasham's leadership..
..with noble intentions..
..to serve the
people of this state..
..we are launching this party.
This party's only ambition,
is to give..
..selfless service to
the people of this state.
Suryam.
Suryam.
Where is the
earnestness in the walk..
..and the fire in the eyes?
Our movie has been stalled.
The movie in which l
was the lead actor..
..and that you wrote
dialogues for has been stalled.
Everyone packed the bags and left.
Pictures come and go.
Money comes and goes. Wipe it out.
lt wiped away your
future and my future.
Anand, a new chapter in
history has dawned here.
A new society. A new mission.
A new path. A new destination.
Progress. Development.
l am talking life and
you are talking politics?
What's more important for
you, politics or movies?
lt's easy for you to say that.
Your father is a Telugu master,
he has a government job..
..he taught you Telugu.
You didn't know what
pain is as you got..
..your four meals each day at home.
After eating a stomach
full you are talking politics.
Did you starve for 4-5
days when you were a kid?
Did you act in a drama company..
..because you couldn't
afford to go to the school?
Did you see the creditors
slap your father with sandals..
..because he
couldn't clear the debts?
You melted my heart, my friend.
- Get lost.
Shall l tell you the truth?
lf you enter politics..
..you would easily devour me.
l am thinking of quitting
everything and joining the military.
We have just got a handful of land..
..the whole world is there
yet to be conquered, friend.
What do you want? Telugu
film industry in one hand..
..the state politics in
the other. What do you want?
l'm going to..
Where is the earnestness in the
walk and the fire in the eyes?
Where is the weapon to fight?
Where is that iron determination?
Where is your courage
that won't let you show..
..your back to the enemy when
you face him in the battlefield?
Where is it?
Will you smile at least when
l come back from the village?
l can't solve your problems.
l am not a goddess.
You can bid me goodbye at
least with a smile, can't you?
Go inside, dear.
Why are you leaving me now? Why?
You are the one who is
sending me away? - Why?
You shouldn't cry now.
You will hide it from me as well?
What's this?
- lt's.. lt's nothing.
Why did you apply to military?
So that you could go
away from all of us, right?
Just because you will
have to feed me, right?
l can fill my stomach. You
can't give up your dreams..
..for my sake.
- l won't go anywhere.
l'm here. l'm just here.
Pushpa.
You will have to bring me back.
l won't come back on my own.
lt's difficult for someone
to play such a role small..
..who already acted as a hero.
- Mind your own business.
l have seen many
actors coming and fading.
The director is coming.
- Did you memorize the dialogue?
Say it once.
- Say it.
ls he that capable person?
He destroyed my family.
He killed my father.
He says he gave him credit,
he created a scene..
..and then he insulted him
in public for not returning..
..the money, and he committed
suicide by hanging himself..
..from the tree to save
himself from disgrace.
Scoundrel, an old man's
body was hanging from a tree..
..but your box was filled with..
But your box was filled with..
You sinner.. - Ashok, you
know the dialogue, right?
Tell him.
- ls he that capable person?
He destroyed my family.
He killed my father.
Mr. Surya Rao, come here.
Give him this dress.
You do not worry. Come,
there are many other characters.
Come. - ..by hanging
himself from the tree.
Scoundrel.. - Give him the
younger landlord's dress.
You asked me to give
it to Venkata Subbayya.
Ok, give him at least
this constable's dress.
Get him ready before the
director screams at us.
Do not get angry, Anand.
Role is important. lt's not
important which role it is.
How many times do l have
to play a policeman's role?
Now they'll call me only
when they would need a police.
No, l'll go home.
Don't show your face.
Cover your face with a beard..
..and a moustache. They will
think it was someone else.
Don't leave a role
that comes your way.
56/Take-1 .
- ls he that capable person?
He destroyed my family.
He killed my father.
He says he gave him credit,
he created a scene..
..and then he insulted him
in public for not returning..
..the money, and he committed
suicide by hanging himself..
..from the tree to save
himself from disgrace. - Cut!
Ok for film?
- Ok.
Ok for sound?
- Ok, sir.
Shut the camera's face.
Reddy, bring that paper..
Mother, so you came to see
your son playing miniscule parts?
God is merciless, son.
Hail lndependent lndia!
- Hail lndependent lndia!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
We are sorry, son.
Pushpa left us all.
lt was a minor fever, but
fate was too harsh on us.
l am performing my
daughter's last rituals.
Her mother and l are just
waiting for our end now.
She should've lived for 100 years..
..but she left us all in
the middle of the journey.
l want to see her face.
l want to see Pushpa's face.
You didn't even let me
see her for the last time.
Take her out. l need to
see Pushpa's face. - Anand.
You didn't even let me see
her face for the last time.
Come. - l want to see
her for the last time.
l want to see Pushpa's face.
l want to see Pushpa's face.
You didn't even let me see
her for the last time. Pushpa.
Come fast. lt's
Chandra moon town company.
Mr. Prabhakar is the director.
- But l met him before.
l don't know all that. He
just asked me to bring you.
For which role?
- What's the matter with you?
lt's the lead role.
- Me?
O lord! - Yes. The
director wants to see you.
Go to the studio first.
Sir.
- Come, Anand.
You look so weak? Did
you stop exercising?
Did you call me for a role?
- Yes, l called you here.
l didn't expect it, but Arjun
Das made you act really well, man.
But that movie was stalled.
- l saw the canned rolls.
You have got talent. l
told the producer about you.
He is contemplating on it.
But there are a few obstacles.
Go there. The producer is
there outside the floor.
Go straight to him and talk to him.
Go and ask him what the role is.
Sir. Director sir, can l know
what the role is?
What's this, man! Of course,
it's the lead actor's role.
Talk to him. -Thanks a lot.
Your daughter can't
bear even a little pain.
Bring hot water and a sari.
- What are you doing! Go away.
Suryam, where are you going?
Your wife is giving
birth to your child..
..and you are going to the
party meeting? - ls that so!
He didn't tell us about it.
Son, Anand asked me to
give you this letter..
..and to bring you straight away.
One of the fists
that you showed me..
..is about to open up. You
must come here immediately.
Your friend Anand.
- Suryam, it's a baby boy.
Child, see your father. Your father.
Your father.
Greetings, sir.
Sir, he's writer Samara Suryam.
His works were published in..
l read them.
l have also seen your play.
So what sort of work
are you looking for?
l write stories, l
write sharp dialogues..
Do you write songs?
- Yes, l do.
A prince has to rescue a
princess who has been abducted.
This warrior who is going
to her rescue on a horse..
..is singing a song
filled with aggression.
Say it again.
- A warrior is singing..
The body is ash,
the breath is fire..
..let's prove it to
the world by lighting it.
lf it's revolution..
When people call us,
when we become victorious..
..the dawn will be inside us.
- And what if someone..
..comes in the path of that
warrior? - Whoever tries to be..
..an obstacle in my
march of success ..
''The body is ash,
the breath is fire..''
''..let's prove it to the
world by lighting it.''
''The body is ash,
the breath is fire..''
''..let's prove it to the
world by lighting it.''
''When people call us,
when we become victorious..''

Long live..
- Anand!
Long live..
- Anand!
Long live..
- Anand!
Welcome.
- Greetings.
Anand came to join our party.
Till date l have been following
people like Mahatma Gandhi..
..and Netaji Shubhash Chandra Bose..
After them it's only you
whom l follow as my leader.
l want to join your party and do as
much service to the people as l can.
lf a star shining in the
sky falls on one's lap..
..it's good for everyone.
What do you say?
Anand, l am very happy.
He's Mr. Bhargav Rao.
- Greetings.
He's Mr. Abhiram. Aaluru Krishnappa.
They are the
presidents of student unions..
..and they are our party personnel.
Please come. Please come.
Long live..
- Veer Pratap.
Long live..
- Veer Pratap.
Long live..

Long live..

Tell me honesty what's
with your entry into politics?
ls it a new thought?
- lt seems that Mr. Samara Suryam..
..has taken the
entire responsibility..
..of the politics of Andhra Pradesh.
Do we have to take
cinema actors in our party?
Do we really need such adornment?
l know the reason behind
the success of your movies..
..is the words
inspired by our dreams.
To sustain that success
you are joining the party..
..and aspiring political
ambitions. ls it right?
l wonder why Mr. Bhargav
Rao is against cinema.
Who are Gopalam,
Samara Suryam and l?
We all belong to the creative field.
lt's a different thing to use
cinema as a political platform.
But to succeed in movies we
can't let a person use politics.
l thought you would be happy
about the decision l took.
Every ray is falling together,
have faith in yourself.
Now we are kings, invincible kings.
Mr. Bhargav, it's with
words that our party succeeded.
The rest of the story
is not unknown to you.
Tomorrow cinema can
also be used as a weapon.
lf we walk together we will
reach unreachable heights..
We will never turn back.
Reach the zenith.
The supreme power is
with us till we reach there.
The phenomenon
called cinema is also..
..an invention of science.
lt's not some devil or ghost..
..to be exorcised.
We shall use Anand..
..in the best way we can,
for the benefit of the party.
Our lives will be dedicated
to reach that destination..
..or our lives are of no use.
So Samara Suryam didn't
like me entering the party?
Why are you feeling
so shy? Give it to me.
ls your affection for
real or is this acting?
Not just serving, but he
is good at cooking as well.
Eat slowly.
They are our relatives.
l told them not to
cross the kitchen.
They wanted to see you once.
lf you don't want to,
l will send them back.
Hey, go away! - lt's alright. Let
them in. Come in. Come in.
She is Sundaramma.
She is Mutyalu. My sister-in-law.
And where's uncle? Come here.
- Greetings.
He's uncle Shankar. The
rest of them are their kids..
..and your fans.
Have you all eaten your meals?
- Yes.
They wanted to talk to you, but..
- What?
Wash your hands. Wash
your hands and come with me.
Let him eat. - First of all,
let him finish his meal..
Let him eat..
Come fast.
- What?
Go. Go and see. Go.
What?
This is called
winning over the masses.
The power that Lenin, Hitler
and Stalin toiled hard to get.
The power to win
the hearts of masses.
But l am just an actor.
- They don't think so.
Look at them. They gave
you a permanent place..
..in their hearts. They would
sacrifice their lives for you.
What will you do with this power?
What shall l do?
You can't leave it here.
You have to increase
it by a thousand times.
You have to use it for the party.
Everything's there in your
face and the silver screen.
Don't say no to reservations.
- Don't say no.
Don't say no to reservations.

There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.
Don't say no to reservations.
- Don't say no.
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.
We are waiting for your
orders to arrest them.
They are doing this so
that we would arrest them.
Why are you lying on the tracks now?
To make you hear our
demand for reservations..
..for all the
backward classes and castes.
Either the law must be
rewritten to give reservations..
..to the backward classes,
or we must die here.
Your action is
troublesome for the people.
People should say that. Or
the passengers should ask me..
..to stop this fight. - l'm
telling you to get up from here.
Either our demands
should be answered..
..or the screams of
the dying martyrs..
..should reach the
central government in Delhi.
Long live..
- Revolution.
Long live..
- Revolution.
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.
Long live..
- Revolution.
Long live..
- Revolution.
Arrest all of them.
Come on. Put all them in the van.

Stay outside for a while.
What's wrong with you!
Are you out of your mind!
ls that why l have been

Why are you getting so close to him?
You know what l
thought when l brought..
..you here from
Rajamundry on a train..
..when were six years old ?
You know what l thought?
What all l went through to
make you such a big star?
You didn't have even a
single grain to eat..
..and l taught you
singing, dancing..
..and gave you these colorful..
these colorful.. - Stay outside.
Shut up! Who brought you to the top?
How much did l spend to
bring you to this position!
Your parents did nothing for you.
Have you done it without
expecting anything in return..
l'll break your teeth.
l left my wife and kids
back in the village.. - Uncle!
..and l wandered with you to
every studio.. - Go outside.
You ungrateful woman!
l'm going to..
- Leave me.
ln spite of having
me in front of you..

Everyone's waiting for
you. Please come fast.

l can't go back to them.
They would even

My mother and father

All of them are beating..
l don't want money.
l don't want cinema.
l just want a place to stay.
Long live leader Jai Prakasham!
Long live leader Jai Prakasham!
Long live leader Jai Prakasham!
l don't think they presented me
this shawl, sword and shield..
..because they are happy
with what l have done.
But they gave me
those as a reminder..
..of the long battle ahead.
You need not have any fear..
..that l might ask for a
golden sword after this.
For the reputation of this party
when l would sacrifice my life..
..all l need is a some
tears from my party-men..
..on my grave. That will
be more precious to me..
..than fame and wealth..
Now hero Anand will
speak a few words.
You have put me in a tough spot.
Sit down.
Am l a person of speeches?
No.
Do l say something l don't mean?
- No. - No.
Lies?
- No.
Do l know speaking in a
poetic language? - No.
But l know about speaking my heart.
- You.
l know about speaking the truth.
- You.
We have only one leader.
- Mr. Jai Prakasham.
We've only one commander-in-chief.
Samara Suryam.
Your friend is supreme in movies.
He is a genius who can
mesmerize anyone with words.
When the commander-in-chief
orders us to come forward?
We will come forward.
lf he invites us to sacrifice
our blood in the next elections?
We will sacrifice our blood.
Long live Samara Suryam!
Long live Samara Suryam!
Long live Anand!
- My smart friend.
Suryam, l am marrying Ramani.
Long live Anand! Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
Do you want a coolie, madam?
Greetings, madam. The train
arrived five minutes earlier.
Brother sent us.
lndumati.
Own house in Gudi street in Bandar.
Telugu professor in
the government college.
Starting salary 300 rupees.
lt will become 400 by next year.
An illustrious family.
l have been searching
for you since two months..
..to find out who my
lndumati is, where she belongs to.
They called me a fool.
But l must be convinced
first that it was foolishness.
l wrote to you to come
here and you left everything..
..and came here? Why?
For a couple of
lines of your poetry.
You wrote me a letter to
come here and l am here.
l went against my father and
mother who gave me birth..
..and came here.
But who am l here?
My dream.
My love.
My life.
l am with you
every beautiful moment.
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.
The moments that we spent together..
..has moved my heart
like never before.
Joy at first moment,
fear in the next..
..the moment when
tears of joy come..
..out of the eye in
the beloved one's arms.
..the moment when
one forgets the world.
l am with you
every beautiful moment.
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.
The moment when one forgets ethics.
The moment when one
forgets the difference..
..between right and wrong.
..when one forgets what's
the beginning and the end.
We started a new
life with one another.
l gave up shame, l
saw my dreams in you..
There is nothing that
can separate me now..
..from your beauty.
l don't care about the
past or the future..
..all l'm concerned about is,
this particular moment with you.
l am with you
every beautiful moment.
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.
l am with you
every beautiful moment.
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.
They couldn't do it, but
we are about to achieve it.
And the reason behind it is that..
..we are about to form
a people's government.
Your government.
Greetings.
What happened to you?
- lt's nothing. Just a minor fever.
A small donation for
the next election..
Your money is not important for us.
Go to people and show them
your face. That's enough.
That's more than
millions of rupees for us.
l became a star with
your party's mercy.
ln the next election
the party has decided..
..to make you contest
from one constituency.
He took this decision in
spite of a lot of opposition..
..from many quarters.
- l opposed this decision.
There are many party
personnel and many people..
..who toiled hard for the party,
but ignoring them and giving..
..a seat to an actor, even
though he's my best friend..
l opposed it as it was not
right to give a seat to an actor.
But he discarded by view.
He said that Anand
represents our dreams.
You have been a
party personnel for long.
Now take a step forward.
lt's in your hands if we
would be the ruling party..
..or the opposition
in the assembly hall.
Will l win if l
contest the elections?
Even if God contests
against you, you will win.
What was her name? Kanchana?
- No, Kalpana.

This is democracy. Democracy.
Everyone is equal here.
- What they teach you..

Cut. Cut. Who is the
supplier of that gun?
Do not forget our
sign in the elections.
Do not forget it. Do not forget.
They shot Anand and killed him.
What rubbish are you talking!
- Who did it? - l don't know.
How did it happen?
- l don't know.
Who told you that he has died?
- Everyone's saying so.
The incident that took
place has shaken the state.
For hero Anand we
have to answer back.
We have to answer back
by making our party..
..led by Mr. Jai
Prakasham victorious.
Another attempt to bring us down.
To weaken our party,
to kill our chief man..
..they conspired against us.
ln movies they use
fake guns while shooting.
That's how it happens. But here,
they brought a real gun..
..and shot him in the neck,
and they want us to believe..
..that it's just an accident.
How would we believe it?
How would we believe it?
They said, that if their party
wins, streams of wine will flow.
Enough of fooling the
public all these years.
Do not get fooled in this election.
Do not forget your sign.
Everything is coming together,
have faith in yourself.
Now we are kings, invincible kings.
lf we walk together, we will
reach unreachable heights..
We will never turn back.
Reach the zenith.
Did our party win the election?
We got 155 seats.
You didn't recognize
her? She is Kalpana.
Poor girl! She got
completely scared.
She came to the hospital everyday..
..as you were injured
right in front of her.
When are you coming to
sing a duet with me?
ln another ten days.
Watch out.
Greetings, sir.
Come here. Come.
A warrior doesn't care
about the injuries..
..and a worker doesn't
worry about the work.
l know you would be perfectly fine.
l came to know that you
have taken a decision.
You shouldn't talk too much.
You shouldn't talk too much.
You should be giving
some rest to your throat.
Without you how can we..
Yes, l want to step
aside from active politics.
How can you ask the
headmaster to write exams!
Without you the party
would become orphan..
Nothing would happen.
My brothers are strong.
They are intelligent. Come.
Select one among you
as the chief minister.
Form a government.
Fulfill party's objectives.
What do you say! What do you say!
Greetings.
You were discharged from the
hospital yesterday itself.
Why didn't you take rest and..
Why did he take such a
decision all of a sudden!
Some people are thinking
of making Bhargav the CM..
Some are thinking of
giving me the chair.
You?
- What did Prakasham sir say?
What do you say? The party
is waiting for your decision.
What did Mr. Bhargav say?
Forget about him.
Leave it to me.
Shall we go?
Even though our party's
won with a great majority..
..under Mr. Jai
Prakasham's leadership..
..since he has
rejected the CM's post..
..we all gathered here to
select a CM among us by voting.
We can elect someone unanimously.
But if there is more
than one candidate..
..then we will
have to go for voting.
The members can announce
their candidate's names.
l propose Mr. Bhargav
Rao's name for the CM's post.
l support him.
l propose Mr. Samara Suryam's name..
..for the CM's post.
- l support him. l support him.
We support him. We support him.
l..

..do solemnly affirm, that l will
bear true faith and allegiance..
..to the constitution of lndia
as by the law and established.

Who is Pushpa?
You called that name
when you were shot.
You called that name
when you were unconscious.
You called that name
twice outside the hospital.
You called that name four
times. Who is that Pushpa?
What's the relation
between Pushpa and me?
You are a person
diametrically opposite to Pushpa.
What?
- Pushpa is a disciplined girl.
And l?
You don't even know
what discipline means.
Pusha is reserved.
She says one word..
..in place of four words.
And one needs to pay
you to shut your mouth.
Pushpa is a family lady.
She's another name of purity.
She's epitome of patience.
She has a good nature.
She is always calm.
She respects elders.
She's pure gold.
- And..
You are arrogant
that you are educated.
You use English a lot.
You are too proud of
being intelligent.
You always think of one-upmanship.
Then why did you
call me Pushpa then?
Why did you call me Pushpa?
You too have a similar face.
The same eyes, the same
nose, the same mouth..
The similarities between
you and her are too many.
l know you are lying.
l don't believe you.
l can't bring Pushpa
here to make you believe me.
Why? lsn't she there?
You look exactly like Pushpa.
- l don't believe you.
But it's great.
ls Pushpa your wife?
Did you love her so much?
Do you love me as well?
Look. The same eyes, the
same nose, the same face..
Do you feel the
same love towards me?
Now tell me. Tell me about Pushpa.
Or else l will jump into the water.
The picture will stop. The
producer will go bankrupt.
What?
Sit down. Your dress
will get drenched.
Tell me then. Tell me.
Pushpa.
lf l wouldn't have married,
what would you have done?
l would've gone to jail.
- To jail?
Yes. With Mahatma Gandhi,
or with Kasturi Bai..
..l would've participated
in the freedom struggle.
l would've
participated in hunger strikes.
The police would've arrested me.
So you are stuck with
me instead of the jail?
l'll bash you up.
Mother, my wife's beating me.
And then?
Oh! What's this! This shiny thing?
lt was there on that girl's cheeks.
She is a princess in this movie.
How did it stick to my face?
You must be standing too
close to her. - Yes, like this.
And then?

Tell me something else.
The rain won't stop.
Tell me.
When you hugged her what
was going on in your mind?
l was thinking about some
other girl. - About whom?
A girl who has large
eyes, small hands..
..a big mouth, and is a
bit innocent. - ls it me?
What are you thinking now?
- About that girl.
lt's a mole. You can't wipe it out.
ls it there to
cast off the evil eye?
So you are that beautiful?
Shall l tell you the truth?
Ugly eyes. Crooked nose.
Big mouth.
This mole is the only part
that's beautiful in your body.
l want it.
- You can't take it.
l want it.
- You can't take it.
l want..
Demon.
Demon.

Stop. Go through Patel road.
Control room. CM's
convoy diverted to Patel Road.
Hello! - Greetings, madam. l am Kri
shna Murthy speaking.
What is it? - CM sir, is
going to Patel Road house.
He might stay there. l
just wanted to inform you.
Ok.
What are you staring at?
l am the same person. l
haven't changed at all.
You've changed a lot this year.
- Like what?
Your walk. Your behavior.
Your conduct. Now there are
men holding guns around you.
Everything's changed.
There's also a change in
your affection towards me.
You are not the old poet anymore.
l studied in a small
school in a small village.
But today l am the chief
minister of this state.
l have no idea about finance.
l have no idea about education.
l don't know law and order.
But l am in the first position..
..among all the chief
ministers of this state till now.
Turn around.
- You can ask the lAS officers..
..who are working under me,
about this chief minister.
Then why is there so
much worry in your heart?
Worry? W.O.R.R.Y.
You are not in a position
to understand my worries.
Manikyam is far better.
That's why no one
wants an educated wife.
Why do you get upset, poet?
l am with you
every beautiful moment.
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.
Every moment..
- No, l want the old poet.
Do not change.
You won't change, will you?
You didn't tell me about Pushpa.
Didn't l tell you not to
ask me about Pushpa? - Fine.
CM and you are best friends?
How much do you like the CM?
Samara Suryam?
How much you don't like him?
Did l ask you
something l don't know?
You left Pushpa and
entered politics now?
Don't you want to be a CM?
Anyone in your position
would have wanted to be a CM.
Be careful.
Both of you are best friends, right?
Both are equal, aren't you?
Then who is greater than the other?
Why are you getting into politics?
- Why shouldn't l?
Who brought you up
in this way, ma'am?
l don't have mother and father.
l don't have siblings.
l grew up on my own,
like the trees and the bees.
Kalpana, be careful. What's this!
Call me Pushpa, or else l
will jump from the jeep.
Are you mad or what?
- Call me Pushpa..
..or else l will jump from the jeep.
Ok, jump.
Kalpana.
Kalpana.
Get up.
Are you ok?
- l am not hurt.
l am not hurt.
l am alive.
What's this?
- Nothing.
Why did you make that mark?
- Just for fun. l'll wipe it out.
Let it be there. Let it be there.
''And then the heart was lost.''
''The flowers blossomed in silence.''
''The breeze blew in the
same direction.'' - Come.
This is what l was scared of?
- Of what?
l was afraid that
something like this would happen.
What?
Don't talk anymore. Let's go.
''At the time when river
Godavari bats eyelid..''
Come, let's go.
''..when my love bows
down in front of him.''
Won't you go? The
meeting is about to start.
They said it would
start at 6 O' clock.
Who is going to talk first?
When will Suryam talk?
The chief minister will talk later,
after Mr. Bhargav Rao..
lt might take another hour or so.
lt would've been
better if went there now.
lt's enough if l go there
when Suryam talks. - Alright.
Are you going late intentionally?
Why are you going late?
lt's alright. l understood it.
l understood it pretty well.
Will you take me there? l
want to meet your friend.
Our government is flying high
on the shoulders on the youth.
We must be proud of this moment.
We have many other
objectives to achieve..
We have to wipe out
the tears of the poor.
To uplift the downtrodden..
..the measures that
we need to take are..
l'll take care of that.
Mr. Anand came to meet you.
Anand?
- He will wait. You carry on.
Chandram.
Ok, then..
Greetings, sir.
He's Mr. Parandhamayya.
- How are you?
Fine.
Come in.
He is..
- l know him. l know him.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
What's the matter he
came here all of a sudden?
ls it some party issue?
- Do not panic.
You will know it
when right time comes.
l heard, that you are about
to distribute the ministries.
Who told you that?
- Suryam, l want medicine ministry.
Health ministry.
- Prakasham sir told me..
..to accept the ministry.
Suryam, you think l
don't deserve a ministry?
No one else did what
you did for this party.
When this issue came
up l proposed your name.
But the working committee says..
..in order to get a ministry you
have to bid goodbye to acting.
l tried to convince them,
but they didn't listen to me.
So Suryam won't give me a ministry.
Anand, if you quit acting..
..you would get the
ministry you want tomorrow itself.
What?
The ministry you want is yours.
l think he did it intentionally.
- He became jealous.
You made him the chief minister.
Now he is showing
us his real nature.
That day when people ran
towards you in Mahanadu..
..his expression change
at that moment itself.
Even he can't deny, that
he became chief minister..
..because of you. How
can he forget it now?
l knew this would
happen a long time back.
You treat him as
your friend, but he..
We shouldn't let an
ungrateful person stay in power.
Stop the car.
Get down. Get down!
Don't you know anything
better than creating rifts..
..between two people? lf
you say one more word..
..against the CM, l will
forget that you belong..
..to our party and l will kick you.
Go by foot. Go.
You may go now.
ls she sleeping?
- Did you say you won't give..
..a ministry to Anand?
- lt's not my decision.
lt's working committee's decision.
You are lying.
lndu, he is an actor.
He is an entertainer.
You want me to give a
ministry to an entertainer?
So you want to say
everyone who got ministries now..
..are intellectuals?
You are a teacher. You
teach hundreds of kids.
You want me to give
the throne to someone..
..who puts greasepaint on his face?
Shall l make him trade
and commerce minister?
Or shall l make him health minister?
Shall l tell you what l think?
You are afraid that he
might compete with you.
You are afraid because
the masses love him..
..the MLAs respect him, so
you fear that he might..
..dethrone you.
- Anand?
CM?
What will happen to the party then?
lt's not about the party,
it's about our selfish reasons..
Yes, it's selfishness.
l too have greed.
l have the greed to become
the best CM of this state.
ln future people should
look at me as the model CM.
ls it that big a mistake?
ls there any honesty left?
ls there any eligibility?
We want an answer from the CM.
The opposition party's
leader is asking me..
..if there is any honesty left?
A one rupee coin has two sides,
like this assembly hall.
One on side there's head, and
on the other side there's tail.
lf there is head without
tail it can't be a coin.
lf there is the same
face on both the sides..
..that coin won't be accepted.
To bring down the government..
..don't make baseless accusations.
Chief minister is trying to
hide the truth with his argument..
He is trying to save the
minister who took the loan.
We are not going to
accept your explanation.
You have to take action against him.
You are a revolution-conch.
An inspiration for all of us.
You breathe life
into others' ambitions.
The evil fate
snatched you away from us.
Those who treated you
as a father-figure..
..have become orphans today.
Our hearts are
weeping in your memory.
l am not about to say poetry.
l don't want to shed a
couple of tears and leave.
l want answers of a few questions.
Why did he leave us in
this way like orphans?
Even the party workers thought..
..that they did the right
thing by casting us their votes.
ls this the government
they were looking for?
A mistake has happened.
Corruption crept into us.
With the greed of the position..
..have we forgotten our objectives?
For our selfish reasons are
we misusing our position..
Today what we lost is not just him..
..but we lost our objectives.
We forgot the truth.
For the peace of his soul..
..just a couple of
tears won't be sufficient.
We need to prove our honesty
and integrity to the people..
..all over again. Those
who are holding positions..
..should ask themselves
some serious questions.
The party's fund accounts
should be shown to the public.
Only then can we regain our
party personnel's confidence.
And only then will
his soul rest in peace.
He hasn't left us.
He will always be
there in our hearts.
Let's observe silence
for a minute in his memory.
Let's pray for his peace.
Go.
Read this one as well.
Read it. Read it.
You call him your brother.
Read what he said about us.
Read it.
Yesterday again Anand
talked against our party..
..to the journalists in Ellore.
- He is upset that our..
..government is not running as
per his whims and his fans' wishes.
He is saying
whatever he want to say..
..because of the
fan following he has.
He feels that no
matter whatever he says..
..there is no one in the
party who could say him anything.
He thinks he is greater than
the chief minister of the party.
The working committee is
waiting for your decision.
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.
What's the decision of
the working committee?
Only after hearing your opinion,
we would take a decision.
Some of our party members
think that Anand should be..
..dismissed from the party,
but others think that..
..if such a step is
taken the party will spilt.
There's some important
news l need to tell him.
They are saying that you
are dismissed from the party.
Who told you so?
- Our men came from..
..the working committee meeting.
We don't know if it's
temporary or permanent.
We came to know that
you were suspended..
..from the party. - l too
came to know about it just now.
lt can't happen. We don't
accept it. We don't accept it.
lf it's true l can't be happier.
Did you ever think that
such a thing would happen?
What do you want to say about it?
Today is one of the
happiest days of my life.
Sir. Sir, one more question.
What is the meaning
of this suspension?
Freedom. Freedom.
Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.
What do you want to do now?
First of all l want to
offer you payasam(a dessert).
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!

Anand's movie is about to release.
There's a message against us in it.
Shall we stop the release? -
Whose reputation will be hampered..
..if you do that? Theirs or ours?
- lt would hamper our reputation.
Then what's the need
to stop it? Leave them.
No, sir. He is misleading
the common man with his movies.
So..
Our party has weakened so much..
..that it can't even stand
against a three-hour movie?
Leave them.

l am sorry to give you this news.
The central government
has banned our government.
This is the government of the
people. People's government.
There is no place
for democracy in this.
Those who were with us,
those who supported us..
..have stabbed us in our
back and went to the centre..
..to bring us down.
lt's very shameful.
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
We were eagerly waiting for you.
, ,
ls my question wrong?
- No.
They can expel me from the party..
..but can they expel
me from your hearts?
No, they can't. They can't.
We are leading in
Pailavaram by 8000 votes.
We are getting a positive response..
..from other places as well.
We are leading in Warrangal as well.
ln Enukondalu as well..
l came here after voting for
the first time ever in my life.
With the anger l have
for you, l should've gone..
..far away from you, or l
should've committed suicide.
But l cast my vote and came here.
l cast my vote for you.
l know why you
didn't come to the temple.
You said it in a weak
moment that you would marry me.
Then you decided against it
after thinking about it, right?
Kalpana. - Don't give me
a honey-coated excuse.
l won't believe you.
Your close aides
must have advised you.
That you launched a new party..
..that the elections are nearing..
lf you become a CM, it
would be detrimental for you..
..if you have a second wife.
That's why you called me here,
called me to the train..
..and made me wait and fooled me.
Did you abandon me
because you didn't like me..
..or because someone said something?
What are your advisors telling you?
Do not marry her. lf you
wish you can make her..
..your mistress. Yes, visit
her place whenever you wish.
Did they say that?
You could've let me die. But
why are you torturing me..
..in this way?
You want to touch me?
Touch me, but do not marry me.
Leave me. l will go.
l will leave both
cinema and politics.
l will go away from you.

There's a recounting at 4 places.
No.
No. We are leading at 62 places.

We are opposition.
You won't leave Anand even now?
Now l'm the one who
will question him.
And that actor will have
to answer me. Anandam!
..will be ours sooner or later.

you became my dream.
You say it..
- You say it, mother. - Me?
That breeze will come again.
But l haven't closed my eyes.
What if that breeze comes today?
O heart, l am helpless..
- Wait a minute. l'll say it now.
For you..
- Greetings, sir.
We got the report of
the Gupta commission.
This is enough to
bring down the government.
We will attach wings to this.
What happened to
the Gupta commission?
What happened to it?
- What happened to it?
Calm down. Calm down.
l request all the members to
follow the basic decorum..
..of the assembly.
Has judge Gupta
completed his enquiry..
..and presented the
report to the government?
Honorable speaker, its
enquiry is still going on..
..due to the
complexities of the case.
Commission report.
Will the CM read it?
Will the deputy CM read it?
Or do you want me to read it?
Honorable speaker, a
government secret..
..that too a report whose
enquiry is still going on..
Stealing and exposing such
a report is against law.
lt's against the law.
- lt's against the law.
lf exposing the
corruption in the ruling party..
..is against law, then l will
go against law a hundred times.
We will do it hundred times.
Long live home minister!
Long live home minister!

Long live home minister!
The Home minister is safe, but
the other delegates got injures.
When prime minister comes tomorrow..
..he will visit the city
with Mr. Samar Suryam.
Put section 1 44.
- lf it turns against you..
lf it turns against me
arrest Samara Suryam..
..and put him in the jail.
- lf we arrest him..
lf we arrest him?
Sir, we are sorry to..
lt's you?
- We thought that there would be..
..an uproar in the state.
To tell you the
truth it's your victory.
What do you call victory?
Getting an old friend
of mine into the jail?
That's not what l meant.
Did you have dinner? Come.
- No, thanks.
lt's ok. Come.
Why did you send your resignation?
l need to tell you something
as a member of this party.
Tell me what it is. Did
l say l won't hear you?
Last week they offered me half a
million for just one sign of mine.
lf l am being offered half a million
or 100 million for a billion project..
..how much money would've
gone to how many ministers..
..from the 78 billions budget.
- You are right.
People have immense love,
respect and faith in you.
At least for the
sake of that faith..
..our party members should be
a bit honest, shouldn't they?
That's the reason people
like you are in this party.
Just one person is not sufficient.
lt is not right to overlook a
fault when it is happening..
..right in front of us. ls
this why people handed us over..
..the reigns to run this state?
- Did you ask this question..
..when Mr. Samara Suryam was the CM?
Why are you giving me
the resignation letter..
..that you didn't give him?
You left that party because of
the corruption that crept in.
And that's the reason l left
that party and came with you.
You said that the previous
government robbed this state.
That it swallowed
every single rupee.
What do you think is happening here?
The condition is far worse here.
Did you add yourself or did
you add me in this corruption?
What l meant was..
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
Long live Anand!
My beloved leader's beloved people.
On our leader's birth anniversary..
..as you wanted, as we
wished from today onwards..
..all the poor will
get rice at a low price.
The first one kilo
rice will be received by..
..health minister Mr. Bhargav Rao.

Sir..
Hey! Go slow.
Mr. Sambayya!
Kalpana is here.
Bring Kalpana back home.
Mr. Sambayya, don't
come home without Kalpana.
Come, let's go.
l could see that smile back
on his face after so long.
He must've definitely
taken some decision..
..or else he wouldn't
have called you there.
l think he would give
you a high position. lt's..
Do not praise me unnecessarily.
- No, actually..
There's a talk that these days
CM is not giving interviews..
..to the press.
- People have handed me ..
..a great responsibility.
- For the government..
..press is like a mirror,
isn't it, sir?
For an actor the audience's claps..
..and for a politician
people's votes are the true mirrors.
And we?
- You are magnifying glasses.
You make everything look large.
Ok, sir, we won't enlarge
them. We will write them..
..as you say. What is
your comment on the scams..
..that took place
under your ministry?
Did you ever expect the
party to split into two pieces..
..in this way? What do you
think is the reason for this?
On Araku road the cat met with an..
- Who?
Mr. Sambayya was in it.
- Who?
We got Mr. Sambayya's body.
- Kalpana?
We are searching, we will get it.
The meet is over.
- Sir, but..
You can see him
later on. Leave him now.
There can't be a
happier day in our lives.
The CM is attending the wedding.
Shall we inform you before he comes?
You go and take care of your CM.
l will take care of myself.
A the time when it
wasn't understood..
..that wedding is the union
of two persons, two hearts..
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.
Greetings.
The ex-CM, the present
CM, all are present..
..under the same roof today.
lt's the good fortune of
this bride and bridegroom..
..and it's the good fortune of
the protEgEs of that great man..
Please come.
l'll sit there.
, ,
lt's alright. lt's alright.
What's the matter,
Anand? What happened?
The body is ash, the breath is fire.
The elections are nearing.
We shouldn't be
smiling at each other.
Come, let's go.
Dear.
lt's 5:30. You had an
early meeting to attend.
You will be late.
Get up.
Dear.
Dear. What happened?
Dear.
Dear.
Oh God!
Dear.
Get up. What happened?
Who's there? What happened to you?
Open your eyes.
Dear.
Sir, CM..
Call me CM after
we win the election.
CM Anand has passed away.
lt must be a rumor.
- No, sir.
l got a call from Mr. Venkatesham.
lt hasn't been
officially announced yet.
, ,
Dressing is going on inside.
Wait for a while.
Greetings, sir. The crowd
will increase gradually.
There might be security problems.

My beloved brother, a rare gem..
..my compassionate friend..
..you have left me alone?
The day before yesterday,
when we were..
..on the threshold of youth..
..we ate on the same leave,
we slept on the same carpet..
..the tears of those memories
are overflowing in the heart.
Our eyes are different,
but our dreams are the same.
Our hearts are different,
but our conscience is the same.
Our paths are different, but
our destination is the same.
You always wanted to
be one step ahead of me.
ls that why you left
me behind even in death?
Where are those hands that
put the victory garland..
..around my neck?
Where are those fingers
which wiped away my tears?
Where is that voice of the cuckoo..
..that sounds like a new flute?
Where are those lips that
uttered those beautiful words?
Where are those shoulders
that carried me that day?
Can't l see you again, my friend?
There is not even a bit
of hatred in my mind now.
There is not even a
drop of enmity now.
ls death the only way
to sanctify the heart?
l wanted to tell you something,
but l couldn't.
When l saw you tired, l
wanted to ask you how you are.
But l couldn't.
Today l wanted to kiss
your lotus-like face.
But l couldn't.
l wanted to hide my tears..
..but l couldn't.
Goodbye, my friend.
Goodbye.
Set a place beside you for me.
Sooner or later l will come
to the place where you went.
lf l see another dawn..
..if l am handed over
the reigns of nature..
..l will fulfill your
ambition and my mine, my friend.
This is my last pledge to you.
