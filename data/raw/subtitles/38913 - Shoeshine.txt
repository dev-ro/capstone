Shoeshine
That horse is a great horse.
Yeah,
he's a really great horse.
As soon as I said,
"Go, Bersagliere, "
he started off
like a rocket.
I don't think there is
another one like that.
- Not even in America.
- That's nonsense. In America...
Who knows how much
they feed horses over there!
I told you not to leave
the horse when you come down.
- You call this a horse?
- And what is it?
It's a small table.
Mr. Anucci, that one is
always kidding around!
- Is the proposal still good?
- 50 or nothing.
- But 50 bills are 50 bills.
- What are they? Only paper!
Easy to say!
Everybody thinks
since we're shoeshine boys
we make money by the bundle.
Come on, let's go!
Is it really expensive
to have a horse?
At least 300 lira a day.
Goodness, Bersagliere,
how expensive you are!
Mr. Anucci, 50 is okay,
but know we are a little short.
- Can we do it in a week?
- It's okay with me.
- Your word?
- My word.
- Your word?
- My word.
- Goodbye, Mr. Anucci.
- Goodbye.
It's right.
Until the horse is ours, he can
rent it out to anybody he wishes.
How much do we have on hand?
I'm not sure, 32, 35.
Why don't you know?
I told you to be accurate!
You're right, but this morning
I made a lot of payments.
Here. Five, 10.
I made all stacks of five.
That's good.
15, 20, 25, 30,
31, 32, 33, 500.
Plus 7, 500
for the guy from Genoa.
And the 3,700
for the porter's lodge.
33, 500 plus 3,700
and 7, 500...
we are short 5, 300 lira.
Marcello,
did the stuff arrive?
No, not yet! It's already
a week that the prick tells me,
"Tomorrow, tomorrow."
And in the meantime,
he gets his shoes shined.
When you bring?
Tomorrow!
To you and your mother!
These pay, you know?
Hey, Pasquale,
do you want to buy this?
No, they're just a headache.
You can't hide them
or cover them up.
Forget it,
someone else will buy them.
Let's go.
What kind of a fool are you,
laughing all by yourself?
I'm thinking that one eats
more than we do.
- Who?
- The horse!
Right, Shoeshine Joe?
How can we do it?
I've been thinking about taking
him by the one
at Port San Sebastian.
That one will starve him
to death!
Right, we were born yesterday!
After work, we go and have him
fed in front of us.
Yes, but that way
he would eat only once!
I didn't think about that.
I could sleep in the stable.
- And me?
- Right, and at your house?
No one will cry
if I free up the space.
We'll see!
For the moment let's worry
about making the money.
- Giuseppe.
- What's up?
Giuseppe, please...
Shoeshine Joe.
On the last curve, Pasquale
told him, "Go, Bersagliere!"
and he started off
like a...
- Running in circles?
- Get lost! I meant to say...
- Get lost!
- What do I do?
When will you bring me
chocolate?
Don't sell it,
eat it!
Do I look stupid?
Thank you.
What's killing us is
that we aren't organized.
If we were, the guards wouldn't
have taken the sausages from us.
From me they took two.
What will they do with them?
- They sell them.
- Pasquale.
- Hi, Annarella.
- Where is Giuseppe?
- I need to talk to him.
- Giuseppe!
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was sent over by your mother.
She needs 300 lira.
What? I gave her 500
this morning.
She said she needs
the money.
- Can I?
- Yes, of course.
Money has sure lost
its value.
Last year I'd give my mother
200 lire and we'd all eat.
Lucky you,
you don't have anybody.
Once you eat,
everybody has.
Nonsense. If I still had
my mother and father,
I would gladly give them
a million a day!
Now you're staying with us.
Don't you like it?
- I do. Who say s I don't?
- Well, let's go now!
You don't sleep
in the elevator anymore?
No. The landlord,
may he drop dead, found out.
At night he calls it upstairs
and I can't go in it.
Now I sleep with Giuseppe
at Quaranta Alighieri.
I won't tell you
the racket.
Shoeshine Joe!
The other day
I took him to the hotel,
he gave me a big chocolate cake
with ice cream inside!
Damn, if I'd known
I would have come too.
I know,
but they don't let women inside.
Hey, Giuseppe.
- Hi.
- Where is Pasquale?
Working in front
of Fori Imperiali.
- Who's he?
- He's Attilio, my big brother.
- He must be rich, huh?
- Yes. He manages.
Listen, could you
come home with me?
I can't leave Pasquale alone.
If I do, he doesn't do anything.
Goodbye, then.
See you this evening.
Bye.
I understood. Today at 12:00
at the gas tower.
Make sure it's serious.
I can't waste time.
Don't worry.
It's a good deal.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
Excuse me.
- Where have you been?
- With Annarella.
I walked her across the street,
with all these cars.
Balls.
Watch it!
You're shining his pants!
What did my brother tell you?
He said that Panza
is waiting for me at 1:00.
Oh, here's Pasquale.
Hey, it's 1:30,
you know.
What did you expect?
We had to eat.
- And this, who is he?
- He's my partner.
Well now,
you even got a partner.
He's my brother.
Well, let's go.
There is some business for you,
two American blankets.
Go to number 48 in Via Babuino,
fourth floor.
If you go at 3:00
you'll find a lady there.
- And then?
- Then what?
You bring the blankets
and she buys them.
At what price?
And why do you want to know?
I'm his partner.
That's right! You're trying
to get the most out of it.
Now they are cheaper.
Get 3,400 or 3, 500 if they pay
that much.
10%is for you.
10%...
300.
That's not enough.
Let's do 20%.
Let's do 500 and that's it.
Give him the blankets!
Let's go, now.
Come on! Come on!
Please be there at 3:00 sharp.
Don't worry.
For sure, whoever invented
elevators was a great man.
You're telling me.
I slept in one for three months.
Prazzi Giulio.
- Ah, here she is.
- That's Madame!
Margherita Donati Anselmi.
Licensed fortune-teller.
Goodbye madam and thank you.
Thank you, miss.
Madam?
What do you want?
We have two American blankets.
I'm not really interested.
- How much?
- 3, 500.
Too much.
3, 000.
Well, let's take a look.
Come with me.
They are used.
Yes, I know, but...
You can make
an over coat with them.
And some American
will stop me!
Don't worry.
Nobody will stop you.
Hey!
You are so distinguished.
You'll look great.
- How much?
- 3, 000.
- And 500.
- You shut up!
- 2, 500.
- Do you think we stole them?
No, but I won't give you
more than 2, 500.
Listen lady, we'll call it
2, 800 and that's it.
Okay, agreed!
- Why did you give them to her?
- What's in it for us?
We won't make more than
500 lire anyway.
- 2, 000, 2, 500, 2...
- Is it a new game?
Leave these cards alone, kid.
Where did you learn
your manners?
Look what you did!
Hey, there is the postman,
the train, the funeral!
What are they for?
- To foretell the future.
- are you serious?
Then could you say what's going
to happen tomorrow?
Listen, if you tell us,
we'll bring a bottle of milk.
It'll be fresh too.
You're only two kids.
So what?
Don't kids have a future too?
For sure!
Then, tell us, please.
25 cards ask, 25 call...
- What's your name?
- Giuseppe.
- Pasquale.
- Cut!
In the home, outside,
what awaits you and what doesn't.
Who loves you and who doesn't.
Pick a card.
At home, there's an old lady
that thinks about you.
My mother,
but she's not that old.
Kid, if you don't stop I won't
continue to read the cards.
This old lady is a little sad
because of a letter,
but everything will be fine.
Outside.
Outside there is a gentleman
that protects you.
- Anucci!
- But he's no gentleman,
he takes care of horses.
The doorbell.
It's a customer.
Wait a moment.
are you Mrs. Margherita
Donati Anselmi?
- Yes. What do you want?
- Police. We have a search warrant.
I don't understand.
I'm licensed.
The police chief knows me.
His wife is one of my customers.
I'm sorry, madam,
we're only following orders.
We have been informed
that you buy stolen goods.
Me? That's not true.
I swear.
Ah, there they are--
those two!
Take them away.
Listen, we must come inside,
you understand.
Please.
- What this all about?
- None of your business.
You sold the blankets,
didn't you?
- Keep the money and go.
- What do you mean?
Don't be stupid. Just go.
Here is another 3, 000 lira.
You didn't see anything.
You know nothing.
- What do we do now?
- Who knows?
Here, 3, 000 plus 2, 800
for the blankets.
That's 5, 800.
Did you hear
what your brother said?
- We didn't see anything.
- And know nothing.
We were sleepwalking.
Come on, let's go.
Now we can go
and buyourselves a horse.
Wake up!
Good morning, Bersagliere.
What a horse!
Like no other.
Look, he's cleaned up
almost everything!
Look at his belly.
It looks like a drum!
- He ate all the chard.
- He's no dummy.
He stuffed himself.
So, boys,
what did you decide?
The horse will stay here.
We'll pay stabling charges
and come every day
and take care of him.
are you going to groom him?
Give him a bath?
A bath?
Don't you wash yourself
in the morning?
A bath? All right,
we'll do it right away.
Untie him, Giuseppe.
Can you help me?
Go ahead, get on him, come on.
Okay, ride him well.
No, no.
No, no.
There they are!
There they are!
These are the two kids.
Go ahead.
Ah, here I am, ex cuse me.
What's going on?
We've arrested these two kids
involved in Via Babuino's burglary.
What burglary?
At that fortune-teller's home.
Yes, yes. Bring them in.
Call Losito too.
Better let it boil a
little longer than a little less.
There have been bad results
for not boiling long enough.
There they are, Chief.
It's them!
Make them confess.
They know everything,
those criminals.
Calm down, lady.
No reason to get so upset.
You'd be upset too if they stole
700, 000 lira from you.
700, 000 lira!
I'd like to have that much!
So, why did you go
to her house yesterday?
To buy some empty bottles.
Liar, you wanted
to sell me some blankets.
And she sure bought them.
Put it into the record--
she bought two American blankets.
This is outrageous!
Now I have to go to jail!
So, Mrs. Donati Anselmi bought
two American blankets.
Where did you steal them?
You kids, look at me!
Ex cuse me a moment.
Where did you
steal the blankets?
We didn't steal them.
A friend, an American,
gave them to us.
What's his name?
- Joe.
- Joe.
Ah, Joe.
What's the name
of the fat one?
Which fat one?
The one who came by
the fortune-teller's yesterday.
Who knows him?
Listen, kids,
don't get smart with me.
I'll throw you in jail and feed
you bread and water for a month.
Don't listen to him,
he's kidding.
You think I'm kidding?
Well, with bread and water
we'd die.
So, do you want to tell
the truth or not?
We told you already!
Losito, lock them up,
then we'll see.
Go! Go!
As for you, madam,
I also have charges against you.
Chief, I'm a honest woman.
Ask your wife.
She's a good customer of mine.
Sure, I'm not surprised!
My wife has a brain like this.
- Go away, please, go away.
- But, Chief...
Go away, go away!
I work and she goes
to the fortune-teller.
You know what she asks her?
When I'm going to croak.
Chief?
Ex cuse me,
but those two boys--
what are we going to do?
Send them to jail, as juveniles,
tomorrow morning.
Is this the home
of the refugees?
- The Filippucci family, please?
- Second floor, 3C.
Ex cuse me,
the Filippucci family?
Amalia,
they're asking for you.
I would like to speak
with your husband.
- Why?
- It's business.
Vittorio... well?
What's going on?
There's a young lady
looking for you.
Outside, on the corner.
Attilio wants to speak to you.
- What does he want?
- To speak to you.
Dad, they've arrested...
- Who?
- Giuseppe.
- So?
- Don't get involved.
Don't go, otherwise
it's trouble for me.
So, who's going?
Annarella!
First, drop the others off
at Regina Cieli, then the kids.
Get out.
Go ahead.
Come with me.
Let's go.
No, this way.
May I come in?
Your family has been informed.
Here...
Liberati Angelo...
resident of Bari.
But, it's been
three months since...
What can I do about it?
They'll write.
If they come,
I'll let you know. Go now.
Good morning, Commandant.
I brought you new guests.
I see!
You certainly keep us busy.
If we continue like this, they'll
have to sleep in the courtyard.
Illegal sale of stolen goods.
Accessory to burglary.
To be held pending
police investigation.
- Take care.
- Goodbye.
- Fede?
- Yes, sir?
- Book these two.
- Sure.
Come here, you two.
- What's your name?
- Maggi Pasquale.
- Your father?
- He's dead.
- The name?
- Luigi.
- Your mother?
- Maria Fabbri.
- Living?
- No.
- Born?
- In Rome on October 29... 1931
Living at?
30 Via Lombardia.
- Near?
- Via Veneto.
I meant,
in care of whom?
Nobody.
I sleep in the elevator.
Homeless...
Now, put your hand here
and push hard.
- Three times four?
- 12.
- Four times four?
- 16.
- Eight times eight?
- 62.
Ignorant!
Eight times eight.
64, ignorant!
- Three times three.
- Nine.
The director!
Attention!
Turn around!
Well, well.
Very well!
Good morning Sarpera.
I heard. My condolences.
- How old?
- 10.
- An only child...
- No, I have four more,
but he was the smallest
and the brightest.
Well, be strong!
Attention!
- Six times nine?
- 54.
- Seven times seven.
- 49.
- Eight times five.
- 40.
- Nine times three.
- 27.
The director, go inside!
- Good morning, Bartoli.
- Good morning, director, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- We're fighting against the bugs,
and they're winning.
A pesticide I invented my self.
- Good.
- We should spray the entire place.
We'll do it, Bartoli,
we'll do it.
- These boys are complaining.
- About what?
- Oh, there are newcomers.
- There are always some of those.
- Who is he?
- Up, come on. Get up!
Stand at attention,
stand at attention!
Attilio Scarale from Velletri.
Accused of armed robbery.
- Confessed.
- Alone?
No, with four adults.
I have a younger sister
and two younger brothers.
My father is
a prisoner of war in Germany.
We had nothing to eat.
Armed robbery! In a few days,
he'll start complaining too.
- And these?
- Come forward, you guys.
Who are they?
Maggi Pasquale
and Filippucci Giuseppe.
To be held pending
police investigation.
Send them to the first section
as soon as the doctor sees them.
Yes, yes.
This morning we had
a delegation of parents.
A delegation?
What did they want?
- To go on strike?
- No, sir.
They came to push
for the investigations.
These boys have been
jailed for months.
Whose fault is that?
If you read the statistics,
you'll see that, compared with 1936,
crime has increased by 60%.
The judges are buried in work.
I understand, but they should
consider that these are boys.
Boys? Armed robbery, burglary,
pick pocketing, procuring?
What do we do to punish them?
Dinner without dessert?
- If there were dessert!
- You see, dear Bartoli,
you must realize that this is
a jail not a daycare.
I'm telling you,
as long as you think this way,
you'll remain an assistant.
Attention.
Not too bad.
Fair.
At ease.
Afterwards, we have steaks.
Not for me.
That's too heavy for me.
- I have heartburn!
- Fried sweetbread and zucchini?
- I wish!
- Me too.
- And me too.
- For me, spring lamb.
Oh, here is Tambuti.
And Attilio?
He didn't want to come.
He was afraid.
Move.
- Okay.
- What is it?
They didn't talk.
I always said that those two
are good guys, you know?
- Boss?
- What?
Boss, I thought it over.
Bring us steaks,
and make them thick.
Tomorrow we need to send them
a package of goods.
Christ, they deserve it.
- What did you order.
- Sweetbread and zucchini.
Also... when the boys are inside
they have to feel good
otherwise they'll have
bad memories
and they become useless.
The trams are still running.
It can't be too late.
are you hungry?
You think my father knows?
Annarella must have told him.
True!
These must be lice.
They sting.
They're bugs.
If you say so.
What is it?
I think they'll let us go
in a couple of days.
They can't keep us here.
We've done nothing.
- Well, Panza--
- Don't say it!
Forget that name, understand?
We know nothing.
- And the blankets?
- Not our problem.
Those are
the fortune- teller's problem.
Let's hope.
I'm sure.
They are lice.
They sting.
It was all my
stupid brother's fault.
I know,
but we have to play dumb.
Then when we get out
we'll reckon.
You think they'll feed him?
Sure, maybe not much.
But in a few days...
You didn't tell Annarella
we bought him, did you?
How could I tell her?
I never saw her again.
We can't tell anybody,
otherwise they'll take him.
I can't wait to see him again.
Don't tell me.
Mr. Annibale!
What is it?
This horse is sick again.
He needs to rest.
Give him water and oats.
Treat him with a water
and vinegar compress.
Then, we'll see.
Damn it! Just today
I had a funeral.
Why don't you hitch
the coach to the horse
that belongs to the boys?
Let's go!
Breathe.
Hard!
Again.
Get dressed.
Here's the ticket
for the soup.
Doctor, I want the ticket
for the bread,
the soup is garbage.
Don't exaggerate.
You boys are always
complaining about something.
I'd like to know how well
you were eating at home.
My father is a fisherman,
I was eating well.
Big fish,
small fish, chowders.
It was great!
Go, Raffaele,
I'll take care of the bread.
The bread is better.
The soup is garbage.
Garbage, garbage...
Put the bandage back on.
- How is Napolitano?
- He's getting worse.
You can't expect to get better
in here.
It's been more than
a month now since he asked
to be moved to the hospital.
Imagine. At the Forlanini,
the patients are like sardines.
So?
They should
send him home.
- What's he here for?
- Vagrancy.
A vagrant?
Better vagrant than dead.
- Let him go.
- If it were up to me...
Then you must be patient.
I am, a lot!
Doctor, newcomers.
Right now?
Go ahead, undress,
the others can wait until tomorrow.
Maggi Pasquale!
Who is Maggi Pasquale?
- It's me.
- Have you been sick?
I've had chicken pox, measles,
whooping cough and that's it.
And you?
I've never had
whooping cough and measles,
but my mother says
I've had tapeworm.
Don't worry.
In here you'll get rid of it.
Parents' statement?
- They didn't come.
- As usual.
- Do they go in section one?
- Yes, of course.
Silence, I said.
Shut up.
Silence. Shut up.
- How many are you?
- Four.
But Gigino is sick,
very sick.
There has to be five of you,
like everybody else.
Pasquale! Don't separate us
from each other.
- I want to stay with him.
- Forget it.
Pasquale!
Leave me alone.
Let go of him.
Cowards, cowards...
Hey, you small boy.
Son of a bitch!
Silence. Shut up!
Understand? Shut up!
What's happening?
A guard knocked around
one of the inmates, a new one.
The walk in the courtyard
is suspended until further notice.
The director holds you responsible
for any disturbances.
The walk in the courtyard
is suspended until further notice.
Yes, until further notice.
Open the shutters,
come on.
Open the shutters.
When I get out of this shithouse,
I'll show him.
I feel like smashing
him in the head.
But what do you want to do?
Pasquale! Pasquale!
You better calm down.
- What's your name?
- Filippucci Giuseppe.
Why did they arrest you?
I don't know.
I don't know nothing.
You can tell us.
We're not going to spy on you.
But I don't know nothing.
That's Gaggi's place.
If he finds you here
when he returns from isolation,
you're in trouble!
- Where do I go?
- Go over there.
Did they make you put
your finger on the book?
- Yes.
- How many fingers?
Four.
- Stupid, silly boy!
- What a fool!
- What an idiot!
- What did I do wrong?
It was very bad.
Four fingers, now you'll have
to serve four years.
Four years.
You'll get rusty in here!
Didn't you see that they
shut the window
because you wanted to stay
with your friend?
You have to stay cool. That's how
you deal with the masters.
Who are the masters?
The guards.
We're supposed to call them that.
- Why?
- Who knows?
- Maybe because they "know-oll."
- You say "know-all, " you ignorant!
Excuse me, professor.
They are masters
on how to steal cigarettes.
Smoking is allowed?
No, it's prohibited and since
it is prohibited we all do it.
He's the only one who doesn't.
He has a lung disease.
I'm going to the hospital now
and I'll be cured when I leave.
- Oh, it's time to eat.
- Finally, it's time to eat!
Time to eat.
Good.
I'm hungry!
Yesterday they
only gave us bread
because the guard said
we weren't booked yet.
It's better to be hungry,
otherwise you couldn't stand
what they give us.
- Bring it over.
- You bring it.
- Bring it over.
- No, you bring it!
I told you to bring it over,
you prick!
How come Giuseppe,
my friend, isn't here?
He is in a different shift.
He'll eat later.
Hey, Pasquale.
Giuseppe!
Pasquale!
Stay in line. If you don't
I'll tell the master.
Shut up.
He's a bastard.
He spies on you.
Attention!
Turn left.
Forward march.
One, two... one, two...
This stuff isn't edible.
It is. At first it looks
that way, but little by little,
if you don't want to die,
you have to get it down.
- What garbage!
- You didn't finish Raffaele?
- Yes, I'm done.
- You've got to try harder.
Even if you don't like it.
You have to eat a lot,
don't you understand?
Understand?
Of course I understand.
You don't want it?
My goodness,
what you can stomach!
are you surprised?
He had the stomach
to shoot his dad!
Sit down.
Don't be stupid.
- Vanzetti!
- Vanzetti is at post 7.
- Filippucci.
- Filippucci.
- Filippucci.
- Stick your hand out.
Filippucci.
- Second floor.
- Second floor.
- Moriconi.
- Moriconi, second floor.
- Cardinali.
- Cardinali, third floor.
- Piani.
- Piani, third floor.
- Attili.
- Attili, third floor.
- Carozzi.
- Carozzi, second floor.
- Valeri.
- Valeri, first floor.
- Proietti.
- Proietti, first floor.
Filippucci.
Hey, a gigantic package!
Where is he going?
Pasquale. Hey!
Look here.
- But, it's prohibited.
- Why?
He's my friend.
Go inside your cell if you don't
want your package confiscated.
- Damn it!
- Get lost.
One of these days I'm going
to destroy that son of a bitch.
Stay cool. In here
you have to shut up and take it.
No, no.
I'm not going to take it.
You're going to get
into trouble.
In the meantime,
I'm dying to eat.
Stay like this
and you'll lose your appetite.
Here he is.
- Five, six, five, six...
- Five, nine, eight, three...
Help yourselves,
there is so much!
Well, just to try.
There were 10 pears, but the guard
took four, and an egg too.
Set that aside.
Don't let them
stuff themselves.
How disgusting!
No, this is for my friend.
Who is he?
A new guy.
This is for--
- There is a note inside.
- Impossible!
My mother is neat as a pin
when it comes to food.
"The heart tells me:
Shut up, don't talk.
Truth is the enemy of love."
- You understand now?
- No.
You blockhead!
They're telling you
to say nothing.
Oh, now I understand.
About time!
There was no need for it.
I wouldn't have said nothing anyway.
Good, I like you.
We'll become friends.
Who gave those to you?
Santa Claus.
We don't have any.
Master?
What is it?
What a thief!
Only three.
Only three, this wretch,
keeper of human meat,
worthless thief, and louse!
Now will you let me smoke?
- I'm first.
- No, I want to smoke too...
- Giuseppe!
- Pasquale!
- I came looking for you.
- Me too.
- How are you? How do you feel?
- Not to bad.
Yesterday I ate,
you know, with that package.
Yes, I saw it.
- I wanted to tell you...
- It doesn't matter.
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?
That must be
the friend of the boy.
I don't like him.
There was no need for them
to send the note.
Do they think we're stupid?
You know, my brother is so afraid
that he shits in his pants.
Damn it! With me he has
nothing to worry about.
Riccardo.
It's Riccardo.
- My pleasure.
- My pleasure.
If you need a towel and soap,
you can borrow mine.
Thank you.
- He found the note.
- Him?
He's a wise guy.
He's in here for armed robbery.
With a machine gun!
There were a bunch of them,
they were stealing cars too.
His father is a doctor,
you know?
I don't like him.
That's because you don't
know him well.
I like the others too.
I wish you could come with us.
Maggi Pasquale,
Filippucci Giuseppe.
- That's us.
- Let's go to see the warden.
The police chief wants you.
Why did you
fire those two masters?
They were stealing from
the boys' packages.
They were trading
cigarettes.
Unfortunately, nowadays,
poverty is turning everybody
into a criminal.
Here are the two guys.
Come on, come on,
step forward.
So, you stated you don't
know the three men
that went into the home
of Mrs. Donati Anselmi,
- isn't that so?
- Yes.
But you know Mr. Anucci,
don't you?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Okay, good!
This man came to see me
yesterday
and told me he sold you
a black horse.
- No, he's white.
- Yes, right, a white one.
I misread.
A white horse,
for 50, 000 lire, correct?
- Yes.
- Yes.
And you bought him
about one hour after...
the burglary in Via Babuino.
You know, I understand
where you're going but you're wrong.
We had the money already.
Is that so? And how did you
make that money?
That's our business.
Listen, boys, I've come here
with good intentions.
I want to help you.
Yesterday I spoke with your father.
The man is out of his mind.
He said to tell me
the whole truth.
It's the only way for you
to be forgiven.
We told you the whole truth.
We know nothing.
Chief, you are too nice.
Give them to me.
I'll make them sing,
these criminals,
with a good beating!
Did you hear?
Why do you want
to get beat up,
and end up
in a dark cell with rats?
To defend who?
Three criminals?
I'd understand if it were
someone in your family,
but you,
you are all alone.
And you, your parents are poor
but honest people.
Listen, Chief,
you can kill us if you want,
but we can't tell you
what we don't know.
Too bad!
The smaller one.
Don't worry,
your turn will come.
Undress him.
Take off his shirt too.
Do you want to speak?
No, please, enough!
That's enough!
Then have you made up your mind?
Give me the names.
We don't know anything,
I swear.
Enough, enough.
I'll tell you everything.
So?
One is called Panza.
The other is Attilio,
Giuseppe's brother.
The third I don't know,
I swear...
I never saw him before.
Giuseppe!
Take him to his cell.
Well, let's go.
What about this guy?
- Giuseppe.
- Pasquale.
So, did they hurt you?
- No, what about you?
- Me neither!
Didn't they use
the belt on you?
are you kidding?
You didn't say anything, did you?
No, no,
I didn't say anything.
I told you to come here,
damn it!
What did he want?
Nothing, he wanted to know
if they beat me up.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing. Why?
You should see your face.
It's my face.
If you don't like it...
don't look at it.
Why are you here?
Do you have a visitor?
No, nobody.
Then what are doing here?
- Mario, take him.
- I'm busy.
You watch him.
Come here.
My mother, where is she?
Di Dio.
That's me.
She's not my mother.
His mother sent me.
She wrote asking me
to come and see you.
Here's the postcard.
- Where is she?
- In Florence.
She went to Florence,
but she'll come soon, you know.
I brought you this package.
There is a lot of stuff in it.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Take care, my boy.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Pasquale,
my mother is here.
I'll see you in the courtyard.
- Giuseppe!
- Come on, move!
Mom!
Do you forgive me, Mama?
How could you do
something like this?
I wasn't involved, Mama.
We didn't know anything...
and didn't do anything!
He is a criminal, I know.
He is wretched...
but he is your brother.
You must not spy on him.
What are you saying, Mama?
Don't pretend.
The police chief told me
it was you two that talked.
Okay, okay,
Attilio is nothing, but you!
"Raffaele, kiss him for me.
Tell him his mother
will be back soon.
She'll bring money
for a lawyer,
so he can get out quickly.
Things are very good
for me in Florence.
Much better than Rome.
Your devoted,
Teresa Di Dio."
- How far is Florence?
- Not far.
I know someone who has a truck
and drives
there once a week.
Then it's close!
Eat, Pasquale!
No, thank you.
Take some, take it.
Don't touch that.
It's his stuff!
He's sick, he needs it!
Spy, spy, spy...
What happened?
You should be ashamed.
We give you
a little freedom
and you take advantage of it
immediately.
What happened?
- He's a spy.
- That's not true!
Behave, boys!
I don't want to pay
because of you.
Behave!
I don't want to get rusty
in here because of you.
Behave!
Behave, boys!
I need to speak with you.
What do you want?
- None of your business.
- Who says so?
I say so.
Listen, Napoli,
you get off easier
because you are sick,
but watch what you say.
Okay.
You don't want
to speak with me?
If you're bringing
a message from that spy
you'd better
save your breath.
You don't have
much of it to spare.
Good, you gave him
a good answer.
Hey, Riccardo.
Go, Giuseppe,
now is the time.
You've got to go.
You swore.
- If you don't, you're a coward.
- What are you saying?
Of course you're going!
Mr. Staffera, in cell number 9
they have a file.
- What?
- They're hiding a file.
Damn it! Maybe if I'd spoken
to him I'd have convinced him.
You're smart,
but that was wrong.
He's the one who has
to come and apologize.
I don't understand,
you were such good friends.
You liked each other.
It's a shame.
Me, I still like him.
But if he...
Those in cell 9.
Whose file is this?
Who does it belong to?
- Whose file is this?
- Who knows?
Whose file is this?
I swear by
the Mother of Christ...!
- Whose file is this?
- I don't know. Never saw it before.
- Whose file is this?
- I don't know!
Get out, get out.
- Who does it belong to?
- I swear on my honor that...
Who sleeps here?
I do.
This file was found
in your mattress.
- It can't be.
- It can't be?
Then, I'm a liar,
is that it?
No, I mean, it's not mine.
- I didn't put it there.
- Then you're accusing your mates
of putting it in there?
- I'm not accusing anybody.
- The file is yours.
Who gave it you?
What were you gonna do?
Nothing.
Nobody gave it to me.
It's not mine,
you see, it's not mine.
Out! Out! All of you!
No, no, enough!
Stop it! Stop it!
Inside.
Lock them in.
- Stop crying!
- You twit.
Don't you remember you sent
your brother to jail?
Everybody will know it was you
who spied on Staffera.
Dry your tears, baby.
Here comes Staffera.
What's your name?
Filippucci Giuseppe.
Good.
If he becomes head of the group
we've got it made.
Now look at him... stupid!
Stop it!
- are you feeling sick?
- I'm burning all over.
My father has
a very helpful ointment.
I'd like to know
who put the file there.
When I find out, I'll smash
his head, I swear to God!
Even if I end up
at Regina Cieli.
Come on, Pasquale,
they all think you spied
so you have to understand...
But it's not true!
Hey, Napoli,
what's his story?
Did he spy or not?
Drop dead!
You could have told me.
I told Raffaele. At first,
even he didn't believe me.
- Me?
- Yes!
Imagine the others!
Now, I don't care
if they believe me or not.
I want to know who put
the file in the mattress.
Just forget about it.
It's over.
Over?
I mean... well, okay...
tomorrow I'll talk to Giuseppe.
You have to make peace, okay?
For me!
Yes, for you,
I'll get him to make peace.
It's impossible to sleep in here.
Stop all that!
I spoke with him.
Come.
He's the one
that has to come to me.
My goodness,
what a pair you are!
He says you have to come,
you sayhe has to come.
Let's compromise.
Just meet halfway, okay?
- Okay, halfway.
- Finally!
Damn it! What bad shape
they put you in!
- Did you go to the doctor?
- No.
Be careful,
he washes you with soap.
Does it hurt?
Yes, it hurts,
but it'll go away.
So, did you make up your mind?
Damn it!
You're making such a fuss!
Listen, boy...
did you tell him who put
the file in the mattress?
No, I didn't tell him.
And not even
who asked me to do it.
As far as I'm concerned,
you can tell him.
What should I do?
Whatever you want.
If you have the courage
to help the person
that sent your brother
to jail...
go ahead.
You heard what Righetto said,
he did it because he thought
they were beating me up.
Damn it!
Don't listen to that moron.
Moron?
Watch your mouth!
It's the truth, Giuseppe.
Go ahead!
Show them what you're made of.
Come on!
Help, help,
they're killing him!
"Tends to be violent,
dangerous to himself and others.
We recommend isolation."
Master!
Master!
What is it?
- I want to go to the bathroom.
- Just use what's in there.
- I see, but then...
- I don't care.
I'm not the one
staying in there.
- You call that a horse?
- What do you know!
Besides, I don't like horses,
they're too slow!
You don't know Bersagliere!
He flies!
- Who is Bersagliere?
- Never mind. You don't know him.
Someone give me a cigarette.
And how do we get them?
- I went to the infirmary.
- We can see.
Idiots!
I mean I've got
everything ready...
to escape.
Yes, but I'm the idiot wasting
my time talking to you guys.
No, no, we're listening.
With you I'll never be able
to put anything together.
Why? We're ready.
You shut up!
Indeed, I won't say anything
just because of you.
What did I do to you?
- You ganged up with Pasquale.
- Yes, it's true.
No, it isn't true.
In fact, when I saw you on the floor
looking like you were dead...
Okay, okay...
So, when entering the infirmary...
- Damn this one!
- Do you want to shut up?
So... the fence...
it's fastened to the wall
with an iron bar.
- I've got everything ready.
- Really?
I cut through
a lot of bolts.
You just need to shake
it hard to break it open.
I figured from the windowsill
to the roof below
there's just about
a couple of yards.
Filippucci?
- Here!
- You have a visitor.
- Here he is, Counselor.
- Thank you.
Come here, my dear.
We have a lot to discuss.
I've been sent by Bonavino,
the lawyer hired by your family
to defend you
and your brother...
Attilio...
Attilio Filippucci.
- Your name is Giuseppe?
- Yes.
Your friend is...
Pasquale Maggi?
- Yes.
- And his family?
He has no family.
Very well,
it's better that way.
Our defense is that you didn't
want nor did you understand.
You have to say it was Maggi
that lured you into selling.
To do what?
You have to say
you knew nothing
but your friend
was aware of everything.
Pasquale also knew nothing.
It was my brother
who arranged everything.
Well, good.
Repeat that in court
and you'll guarantee your brother
is in for five years.
- But it's the truth.
- Save the truth for your confessor.
In court,
you say what I tell you.
This famous horse
could not have been bought,
as the defense
would want us to believe,
with hard-earned money.
It was money
from illegal activities.
That's absurd!
The stolen goods have
been recovered.
Where is the horse now?
Don't answer.
If I didn't know
you well, counselor,
I would think
that in your vocabulary
"horse" is synonymous
with "lawyer's fee."
You must be joking!
Why did you buy the horse?
To ride him!
- Ah, to ride him. Is that so?
- It's the truth.
How much did you plan on
making from him?
Sergeant,
bring in Maggi.
I bring to the attention
of the court
that Maggi has been
characterized
as "Tends to be violent.
We recommend isolation."
So, when did
you buy the horse?
Ex cuse me, Your Honor,
I don't understand why
the horse is so important.
I'll tell you why.
Who are you defending,
Maggi or the Filippucci brothers?
The Filippuccis.
I've been hired by the family.
Maggi is with Carbone,
a public defender.
How much did each of you
own of the horse?
That is, what was your share
and what was Filippucci's share?
We each have half.
Did you sign any papers
to that effect?
No.
If there were a dispute
between the two of you,
how could you
prove ownership?
Can you tell us
where the horse is hidden?
Don't answer!
The accused
doesn't have to answer that!
- Who is that?
- Who knows? Maybe the Queen.
Where are you going?
Hold on.
You can't go through.
Stop! Stop!
You can't go inside!
A Roman emperor--
I can't remember his name--
called his horse "Senator."
Man, he speaks good.
Why be surprised
if two poor boys,
two kids living on the street
put all their money...
all their hopes on a horse?
- I've seen him.
- What's the counselor saying?
- He is talking about the horse.
- Did you ever ride a horse?
- No, but I'd like to try.
- Can't you keep quiet or not?
Who's talking?
You don't need to be a doctor
in psychology to understand
the overbearing influence
that Maggi had on his friend,
the little innocent Giuseppe.
Just look at him.
Who wouldn't want him
as a son?
I'm not accusing Maggi.
That's the district attorney's job.
- Let's go.
- We've got to be brave.
- My poor sons!
- Don't be like that.
- Shouldn't we go back inside?
- No.
Who's saying these
innocent boys had a house,
a family, school, a job?
This is not a crime.
Should they then
be considered criminals?
If so, ladies and gentlemen,
you must condemn all of us,
as we are the people who,
in pursuit of our passions,
abandon the children
to fend for themselves.
And our children are alone.
All alone.
Mr. Cadore, your turn.
I'll be brief,
as is my custom.
On the other hand,
I did not have the time to delve
into the details of this case.
Therefore,
I will entrust my client
to the fatherly clemency
of the court
and I ask
for a complete acquittal,
or a very light sentence.
Very, very light.
Marcello!
...in addition, sentence
the youth Maggi Pasquale
to two years and six months
in prison and a 2, 000 lira fine,
and Filippucci Giuseppe
to one year in prison
and a 1, 000 lira fine.
Without appeal.
Giuseppe, Giuseppe!
You rascals! You villains!
Here they come!
Poor boys,
my poor sons!
Giuseppe!
Attilio.
Oh, here he is,
finally!
We thought they'd put you
in front of the firing squad.
How did it go?
I got a year, but I don't care.
Where is Riccardo?
He's gone to meet his mother.
She has to give him the money.
- Then, you've changed your mind?
- are you crazy?
This morning, Sicilia and I
went to the infirmary.
He's still there
and everything's in place.
I wish I could see the face
of the district attorney
- when he finds out I've escaped!
- How much did Pasquale get?
- Two years.
- That much!
And why?
What happened?
That stupid woman didn't come,
she sent my father instead.
- But--
- But what?
- We're escaping anyway, right?
- Without money?
- They'd catch us again tomorrow!
- What about me?
They gave me one year,
don't you understand?
I don't want to stay here.
I want to get out!
Shut up, you idiot!
Do you want to ruin everything?
You're worried about one year?
Without money
there's no breaking out!
That's why I asked my mother
for 10, 000 lira,
but the stupid woman
told my father.
He figured it out, and now
he wants to talk to the director.
He's going to have me
put in isolation.
He told me I have to "serve, "
I have to pay for it.
Damn him!
He says I'm the disgrace of
the family. They're ashamed of me.
I've got money.
Where?
- I've got it.
- How much?
Over 50, 000 lira.
Look, they're here.
Here come the entertainers.
- What are you showing tonight?
- Something good?
are we going to see
naked legs?
A comedy would be better.
- They're showing a movie.
- Big deal!
Last time they showed
something silly
like we were still
in kindergarten.
I like it.
I've never been to the movies.
So? Did you have to come
to jail for that?
We're lucky.
They feed us,
they shelter us,
give us clothes,
they even entertain us.
What else could you want?
It's a swell bargain.
NEWS FROM THE FREE WORLD
In the Pacific Ocean,
General MacArthur
continues the successful campaign
against the Japanese.
Bougainville is the target
of a strong off ensive
carried out by the navy
and air and ground forces.
The attack is being led
by the destroyers.
Pasquale-- the ocean!
The American forces
are on land,
one step closer
to Japan itself.
Open-- open the window.
Lights!
The lights, please!
What are you laughing about?
Hey, you kids--!
What are you doing there?
- Damn it, we've been caught!
- Why didn't you wait?
Open up, open up!
- Open up!
- What is it?
They've jammed the lock
and locked themselves inside.
- How many are they?
- I've seen two.
Open up, boys!
Open up!
Open up!
Stop! Lights!
The lights, the lights!
Calm down, for heaven's sake!
Calm down!
There's no danger.
Turn on the lights.
Lights, lights!
Master, master!
My God, it's Raffaele!
Let's take him
to the infirmary.
Open up! Open up!
Open up, boys!
Open up!
Boys!
Come back!
Boys!
Come back or I'll shoot!
Boys,
consider the consequences!
Boys!
Boys! Boys!
I want to go away.
I want to leave too!
Go, go!
Take him back to his cell!
Five or six have escaped.
Sound the alarm,
surround the building.
- Come on, where is your cell?
- I want to see him.
Tomorrow.
We have to wait for the doctor.
- What if he's dead?
- Let's hope not. Now come.
To the cells.
Take them to their cells.
I told you to take them
to their cells.
- Arcangeli has escaped.
- Who's escaped?
Arcangeli, Giuseppe
and five others.
- Really?
- There were more than 20.
- And Napoletano is dead.
- Dead?
- Yes, but they caught them.
- Idiot! They had a car waiting!
Giuseppe had the horse too.
A horse? What horse?
Did you hear that?
They had a horse too.
Where did they keep a horse?
The guards!
Stop!
Stop there, boys!
Come on,
we've got them--
Come on, come on!
Bartoli, get the forms ready
for tomorrow.
And the report.
One page is enough.
- Tomorrow? Maybe I won't be here.
- Where will you be?
I don't think this is
the right place for me.
I don't even know where
the right place for me is,
but in here you need
people tougher than me...
tougher than me.
In any case,
there was nothing to be done.
The poor boy--
his days were numbered.
Don Biagioni, I'm devastated.
It's my fault. It's my fault.
Calm down, calm down.
It was an accident.
We caught them.
There are two missing--
the criminal Arcangeli,
and Filippucci,
the little one who was
sentenced this morning.
We informed the police.
They won't get far.
You don't believe
they could leave town?
Where would they go?
Without money,
dressed as inmates,
they can't go around
naked in winter.
Unless the families help them out,
and that's unlikely.
I know Dr. Arcangeli
and Filippucci's folks are poor.
You can't imagine the troubles
we'll have with the department.
Mr. Staffera!
What do you want?
I know where they went.
- Who?
- Arcangeli and Giuseppe.
Where?
I'll take you there.
He's not here. I knew it.
They took him away.
Look over there!
What happened?
What did they do to you?
My head hurts.
They beat me up-- the big one.
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.
They came,
they wanted the horse.
They said it was theirs.
My head hurts. They beat me up.
The bigger one...
Get down!
No, no, Pasquale, no!
Giuseppe?
Giuseppe!
Giuseppe... Giuseppe!
Mother of God,
what have I done?
What have I done?
Giuseppe!
THE END
