Want to see it again little girl? It shouldn't frighten you.
Sorry. Nothing until matinée tomorrow.
Lady, would you mind taking off your hat?
Excuse me.
Show'em how.
Alright. Thank you folks. Thank you very much.
One final request, alright?
I've written a Letter to Daddy!
Alright, alright. I've Written a Letter to Daddy!
I've written a letter to daddy!
His address is heaven above.
I've written dear daddy we miss you,
And wish you were with us to love,
Instead of a stamp I put kisses,
The postman says that's best to do
I've written this letter to Daddy,
Saying I love you.
I've written a letter to Daddy saying I love you.
Thank you very much.
Well what do we have here?
All for you.
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?
Thank you, young man. That's a gorgeous doll.
Folks, have you ever seen such a lovely doll?
Alright children, thank you.
Now folks, please, please, don't forget...
There's a genuine Baby Jane doll waiting for each and everyone of you...
...out in the foyer. All you have to do is go out there and collect her...
And kids, remember, you can tell your moms that every one of these dolls
is an exact replica of your own Baby Jane Hudson. Thank you.
Baby Jane dolls. Only three and a quarter...
Very beautiful. Natural hair. Very beautiful. Only 3.25.
I won't. I don't want to go back to the hotel.
I don't want to take a nap and you can't make me!
Now Jane, don't act up. You've got to take your nap, you know that.
No I don't and I'm not going to!
Now Jane, you don't want all these nice friends to think you're a bad little girl, do you?
I don't care! I want an ice cream.
Now Jane I told you...
I want it! I make the money so I can have what I want!
Jane, that's enough.
Leave me alone. I need an ice cream!
If you need an ice cream, I guess you'd better have some.
I mean, it's pretty hot and all. But remember, this is the last time this week.
Alright daddy. Blanche wants some too. We gotta have some ice cream for Blanche.
I don't want anything.
What do you think you're trying to do?
( I always say it's the parents' fault in cases like this. )
( I'm really disappointed. )
Sure is a hot day today...
You're the lucky one, Blanche, really you are.
Some day it's going to be you who'll get all the attention.
And when that happens I...
I want you to try to be kinder to Jane and your father than they are to you now.
Do you know what I mean?
I hope you'll try and remember that.
I won't forget. You bet I won't forget!
The Excelsior Agency sent you...
Uh-hum. Is there any chance for me?
That depends if Mr Webber likes you.
What type does he like?
Oh, not a personality...
I'll catch on... Watch me.
Oh boy, oh boy...
My money and I should make a picture like that.
Good morning. Mr Webber. I'm Miss Brent.
Oh, yes. Won't you come a little closer, please?
She's got a Southern accent like I got a Southern accent.
Yeah. I know it's 11 o'clock. I'll be there when I get there.
Yes, what is it?
Mr Gravner is here for you.
Gravner? I'll come out.
I'll be right back Miss Brent.
Help yourself to some cigarettes. Make yourself at home.
Then the job is mine?
Didn't you ask?
Oh boy, oh boy...
Cut it!
What do you think Bernard ?
What's thinking have to do with it?
She stinks, doesn't she?
The end is pretty good. Maybe we should have seen it too.
Oh please.
Are you gonna want that picture again today, Mr. Colden?
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want that picture again.
When the old man hired the Hudson sisters
how come he had to hire the back end of the act too?
Boy, what a no talent broad that Baby Jane is!
Why can't she stay sober?
Jane's got her pride. She's a very sensitive girl.
Listen. Your very sensitive girl doesn't do away with 6 cases of scotch
and slug two studio cops,
not to mention one or two other less savory items of publicity.
before we got that so-called epic in the can.
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.
If Blanche won't let us out of that clause in the contract
which says that we have to make a picture with Baby Jane
for every picture that we make with Blanche
then Baby Jane's contract won't be any problem.
That's what we pay lawyers for.
Possibly. Somehow I can't see Blanche doing that.
You know, I don't get it. Blanche Hudson is the biggest thing in movies today
she can write her own ticket. She's got script approval...
she's got more money than she knows what to do with...
Hi...
You know, she just bought that tremendous place Valentino used to have.
It's going to take a year to fix up the place before they move in.
Well I guess they can manage to struggle on where they are now.
But my point is she ought to have sense enough to know
that she can't make a star out of Baby Jane again.
Blanche doesn't have any illusions like that.
She's a very fine person, Van.
She's never going to forget those early years.
what her sister did for her. She told me that herself.
I tell you she's not doing Baby Jane any favor.
Some day sooner or later that girl's gonna end up in a home.
You're going to be at the party at The Globe tonight, aren't you?
Did you ever try refusing one of Blanche's invitations?
Do me a favor, Marty. You talk to Blanche.
Try to make her understand
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
Remind me to send you one of those Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.
I've got mine for this year.
I don't get it Marty.
Why do they make monsters like this for?
For Blanche Hudson!
That's our problem.
You go to bed.
Hi mom.
Hi dear.
Isn't she great?
Sorry to break in on this fine old Blanche Hudson movie folks,
But you'll be glad I did when you see what I have right here
for that favorite pooch of yours.
And Illiad means quality.
So, when your dog says "Whoof, whoof", feed him Illiad.
Oh shut up!
Oh my goodness, I remember the first time I saw that picture.
I thought it was just wonderful.
When was that?
Let me see now. As I recall, your father took me to see it at the old Majestic.
Before we were married.
She must be 150 by now...
As a matter of fact, I think Blanche Hudson is just a few years older than I am.
Really?
Yes, dear. Really.
Well how come we never see her around?
We've been living next door to them for 6 months now.
And the only one I ever see is that fat sister slouching around.
Don't they ever have company?
I mean, it must be awful.
You know, Julie says that sister is kind of peculiar.
Did you ever notice that?
No, I never have.
Well, that's what Julie told me.
She said that she was supposed to be responsible
for the accident that crippled her sister Blanche.
Well that all happened a very long time ago, dear.
And maybe you shouldn't pay too much attention to everything that Julie tells you
There's too many people in this town with nothing else to do but talk.
Maybe so. But Julie's folks have lived here a long time
so I guess she should know.
Turn up the volume. We're missing the picture.
Oh, he should have held that shot longer...
I told him that when we were rehearsing and also in the shot.
He wouldn't listen.
Still a pretty good picture.
Enjoying yourself?
Jane, what are you doing? I was...
I was watching!
Then you're an idiot.
I won't have you speak to me like that.
Ah, poor thing.
Poor baby. Quiet darling.
Good morning Miss Hudson. I hope I'm not intruding.
I just couldn't resist cutting these flowers for your sister after seeing her show yesterday.
You must be very proud of her new success.
On television, I mean.
Yeah.
I can't tell you how nice it is to be seeing all her old pictures like this.
I'll tell her you said so.
You know, my daughter and I would just love to meet her one day.
Perhaps she could...
Mrs. Bates my sister doesn't ever go out.
She's not fit to receive visitors.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.
I had no idea that...
Well, I hope she likes the flowers.
Thanks.
You miserable bastard...
Oh Jane, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.
I was just wondering who all those people were at the back door.
It wasn't anything.
Just that nosy Mrs Bates going on about your picture last night.
Oh, really ? Did she like it ?
Oh, really ? Did she like it ?
She liked it.
I remember when it first came out it had a tremendous reception.
The critics described it as brilliant.
Remember what year you made that picture ?
But of course.
You must too, 1934. Right after I did "Moonglow".
I made a picture that year too.
Oh, yes. It was that comedy directed by Lloyd, wasn't it ?
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.
"The Longest Night". Marty MacDonald said it was the best thing I ever did.
They never even released it in the United States.
Feldon was very upset. He told me the company had a very bad year and
No they didn't. They had a great year. They didn't want to show my film.
They were too busy giving a big build up to that crap you were turning out.
I'll clean the cage.
Oh, that would be Elvira.
Yeah.
Come in Elvira.
How are you today ?
Fine.
Oh, you've seen Jane.
Uh-huh.
I don't think she´s feeling very well today.
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby about Miss Jane like you said ?
No, I haven't yet. It's rather difficult.
I don't want to upset her again if I can help it.
She'll be upset anyway, Miss Blanche.
And the longer you leave it, the worse it's gonna be.
I know.
But I was just hoping it wouldn't be necessary.
I think she seems much better lately.
It's none of my business, but she's been drinking again. You know that, don't you ?
No, I hadn't noticed.
Oh, I don't think it does her any real harm.
I think I understand her.
Oh, you do ? Then you ought to take a look at this.
What are these ?
I guess it's what you call fan mail.
Oh, how kind people are.
You'd better look at them and then you can tell whether or not you've seen them before.
Did you read them ?
No.
But they've been opened.
That's right. They all have.
And there's one in here marked "personal".
The other night my husband and I watched that lovely old movie of yours,
"Last Honeymoon".
I remember saying to my husband at the time
that seeing you again was just like meeting an old friend.
Oh, that's charming. It's really charming.
The point is you never saw them before, did you ?
No.
I thought that.
I'm sorry. I thought you ought to know.
But I don't understand.
Where did they come from ? Where did you find them ?
In the trash barrel, that's where.
They're from that television station that's been running your old movies, aren't they ?
Yes.
You mean Jane...
Who else ?
She must have thought they were advertisements.
Then why would she open the one marked "personal" ?
And what about this. You might as well see this too.
Writing those dirty words.
I can't even remember the last time I saw words like that written down.
Why would she do a thing like this ?
You know what makes her do things like this.
She's sick and she's not getting any better.
In fact, the last month she's been getting a lot worse.
If you don't believe me, why are you selling this house and planning to move out ?
You said this last month she's been a lot worse.
Do you think she knows ?
About selling the house ?
How could she ? You don't have anything in writing.
We're sisters, Elvira. We know each other very well.
I just think she's jealous because of those old movies of yours
they're showing on television this week.
Anyway, in 6 weeks you'll have to hand over the house and she'll have to know.
How do I tell her ? How ?
Well if you just speak to that Dr. Shelby. Maybe he could tell her.
No.
No, it ought to be me.
I can't let a stranger tell her.
But he's a doctor, Miss Blanche. And she's a sick woman.
Elvira, you didn't know her when she was a little child.
When she was young...
I've seen those pictures she keeps.
Oh, no. It wasn't that she was just pretty.
She was different. She was so alive.
I was cleaning the cage.
The bird got out.
But where is it now ?
It flew out the window.
You let that bird out on purpose Miss Jane.
I just told you. I was cleaning the cage and the bird flew out the window.
I'm sorry.
She did that on purpose. Believe me, she did it on purpose.
Never mind. Maybe he'll come back.
Elvira. You won't change your mind will you ?
I mean, about coming to live with me ?
You know I don't go back on my word Miss Blanche.
But you've got to make up your mind about finding somewhere for Miss Jane.
Where they can look after her properly.
I have. I have made up my mind.
I'm going to call um Mr Shelby today.
I know, Miss Blanche.
It's just that I have to be sure that I'm doing the right thing for her.
Hello, this is Johnson's ?
I want to order some liquors. It's Jane Hudson.
What do you mean you can't fill any more orders for me ?
My sister did ?
Well...
Wait a minute, I'll put her on.
Blanche. Would you speak to this man from Johnson's ?
Hello. Who is this please ?
Oh, yes Mr Carson.
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson. What seems to be the trouble ?
I'm afraid there's been some misunderstanding.
I certainly didn't mean to suggest that you shouldn't fill any oders for her.
After all we do pay our bills, don't we ?
Yes, fine.
Would you, please ?
I'll put her on.
Ok then ?
Good. I'd like to order 6 bottles of scotch and 3 bottles of gin.
The same brands.
And as soon as possible.
I just told Miss Blanche.
I'm going downtown to see a man about jury duty.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Hello.
Hello.
I've written a letter to daddy...
His address is heaven above.
I've written dear daddy we miss you...
And wish you were with us to love...
Instead of a stamp I put kisses...
The postman said...
The postman says that's best to do
I've written a letter to daddy...
Saying I love you.
Now when I'm very good and do as I am told...
I'm mama's little angel and papa says I'm good as gold...
But when I'm very bad and answer back and sass...
Then I'm mama's little devil and papa says I've got the brass.
Now I wish that you would tell me
'Cause I'm much too young to know...
Alright Blanche, I heard you. Miss big, fat movie star!
Miss rotten stinkin' actress!
Press a button, ring a bell
and you think the whole damn world comes running, don't you ?
Lunch, Miss Hudson! Why certainly, Miss Hudson!
I'm sure we can find something appropriate for you Miss Hudson!
Oh, you brought my lunch. A bit early, isn't it ?
What were you ringing for ?
I wanted to tell you something's wrong with the telephone.
Mabe it's been left off the hook downstairs.
Is that so ?
Who did you want to call, Blanche ?
Well, actually, I wanted to call Bert Henley.
Oh, our business manager.
Yes.
There's something I've been meaning to discuss with you.
Well ?
You see, the point is Bert thinks we'll probably have to sell the house.
Why should we have to sell the house, Blanche ?
Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
Our financial position is such that we just can't afford to...
We got plenty of money invested, I know.
Yes, that's quite true. But...
some of those investments aren't paying much.
When did our business manager tell you all this ?
Early last week, I think.
He didn't call here last week. I know that too.
We didn't actually speak on the telepone.
He wrote me a letter.
He didn't write you any letter either.
There hasn't been a letter from his office...
Jane there has...
You're a liar. You're just a liar. You always were.
Bert never wrote any letter or called you on the phone telling you to sell the house.
You called him 4 weeks ago and told him to sell it.
I did nothing of the sort.
Don't you think I know everything that goes on in this house ?
You've been spying on me.
What do you think ?
You are disgusting.
After all I've done for you you spy on me. When all I'm trying to do is help.
Who are you trying to help Blanche ?
What are you planning to do with me when you sell the house ?
What did you have in mind ? Some nice little place where they could look after me ?
Better not tire yourself out using the phone anymore.
If there are any calls, I'll take them downstairs.
Eat your lunch. It'll get cold.
Jane. Please wait.
Jane.
Jane I want to talk to you. Please.
Jane I want to talk t...
Telephone, mother.
Alright dear.
I need your help...
I called this morning and placed an ad.
Did we give you a reference number ?
Oh yeah.
Alright, here it is.
Do you want to check the copy ?
That's fine.
Do you want this in the personal columns or in the want ads ?
I always think the personal column is nicer, don't you ?
Yeah...
An eight-line ad... that'll be $6.30.
And uh... who's placing this ad ?
We have to know.
I am.
Yes, I know. But who for ?
You see, when you're placing an advertisement for someone to do a job for you
we have to have your name for the record.
My name is Jane Hudson.
Maybe you remember me. I'm Baby Jane Hudson.
Oh... sure...
Thank you. This will be in the paper tomorrow.
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson ?
Please call Dr Shelby at 0L61656 and ask him to come here to the house immediately.
Please... under... no circumstances...
let... my sister
see... the... contents
of... this note.
Blanche Hudson.
Oh, Miss Hudson. How nice to see you.
I was just going to call on you.
Why ?
I just wanted to ask you about the flowers I brought over for your sister.
I'm afraid they don't last very long this time of the year and perhaps you'd like some more.
Well you saved yourself the trouble.
Oh. it is no trouble at all. I'd been cutting some, that's why I came over.
I always think it's so nice to have flowers in the house...
Mrs Bates...
I guess if my sister needed flowers we could afford to buy them.
What's the matter mother ? You look as if you'd been in a fight.
I'm not sure that I haven't been.
Jane Hudson makes me so mad I could kill her.
Gee! That's a good idea. What'll we use ?
Did you have a nice drive ?
What are you talking about ?
Nothing dear. I ...
So long since you were out of the house
that I thought you had gone out for a drive or something.
I was thinking. It's ever so long since we had a talk...
you know, real talk. About the future and everything.
Jane. I didn't want you to be worried about the house.
Even if I have to sell it we will still be together.
Blanche, you're not going to sell this house.
Daddy bought this house and he bought it for me.
You don't think I remember that, do you ?
You're wrong, Jane.
You've forgotten. I bought this house for the two of us when I signed my first contract.
You don't think I remember anything, do you ?
There are a whole lot of things I remember.
You never paid for this house.
Baby Jane Hudson made the money that paid for this house, that's who.
You don't know what you're saying.
Blanche, you aren't ever going to sell this house.
And you aren't ever going to leave it.
...either!
Jane.
Jane.
Do you remember when I first came back after the accident ?
You promised you wouldn't ever talk about that again.
I know I did.
But I'm still in this chair.
After all those years I'm still in this chair.
Doesn't that give you some kind of responsibility ?
Jane, I'm just trying to explain how things really are.
You wouldn't be able to do these awful things to me if I weren't still in this chair.
But you are, Blanche. You are in that chair.
And tell me. What are these awful things I'm supposed to be doing to you ?
I mean... you wouldn't have to work so hard.
And I was thinking maybe...
maybe Elvira could come in more often.
Maybe she could even live with us.
We don't need Elvira.
But you get so tired. You...
There's so much to do and you're not well.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should get a check-up or something.
That would be wonderful.
Perhaps we could find a really good doctor.
Yeah, we could get hold of that nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we ?
Yeah... let's see.
What's his number again ?
And under no circumstances tell my sister the contents of this note...
It's not me that needs a doctor, Blanche.
Hello lovey!
Don't stop for me.
What did the doctor say ?
He says it's no use my going back to work for another 6 months.
Didn't he even give you anything new to take ?
He always says it's arthritis.
And the only thing for me to do is not to cry and work until it clears up.
Did he suggest what we're going to do for money in the meantime ?
No dear. Oh, but he's ever such a nice man.
Now laddy, never you mind anyway
You know, we still got a bit of savings.
You're my little worrier.
Oh, that's nice. You've found something, have you ?
You don't have to get excited if you haven't even seen what it is yet.
No dear, but it's a possibility, isn't it ?
I mean, there aren't that many jobs that would
be suitable for someone with your qualifications.
What qualifications ?
Well... you know... serious music.
This sounds like just the ticket, doesn't it ?
You're gonna call ?
Call who ?
These people.
Might as well.
Now ?
Well it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use calling next week, would it ?
No dear.
Mom, I'll tell you what. Why don't you call for me ?
Tell them you're my secretary or something.
Alright dear, I'll do that.
Now listen. I won't let on who I am. I'll just tell them I'm Mr Flagg's secratary
SECRETARY.
Secretary...
What do you know?
I do believe your old mom would be a jolly good secretary at that.
Don't you think ?
Hello.
This is Jane Hudson.
Oh, about the ad.
Who is this ?
This is Mr Flagg's secretary.
Oh, his secretary.
Yes, Mr Flagg is very interested and he'd like to know if he could have an appointment.
I think you'll find he's very well qualified.
Yes, I'd be glad to give Mr Flagg an appointment.
Well now, let me see, umm...
How about 4 this afternoon ?
I think that would be fine.
I'll be expecting him then.
Thanks.
It's all fixed lovey. Oh, your old mama's man has everything, hasn't she ?
Oh, shut up !
What do you want this time ?
Who was on the telephone ?
None of your business. What were you ringing for ?
I'm hungry Jane.
Of course you're hungry. You didn't eat your dinner. That's why you're hungry.
But you forgot my breakfast.
I didn't forget your breakfast.
I didn't bring your breakfast because you didn't eat your din din...
You know, we're right back where we started.
When I was on the stage you had to depend on me for everything.
Even the food you ate came from me.
Now you have to depend on me for your food again.
So you see we're right back where we started.
Why are you doing this to me ? Why ?
Doing what ?
Making me afraid to eat. Trying to make me starve myself.
Don't be silly. If you starve you die.
I don't know what you're talking about. You really must be sick.
Jane.
Did you ever stop to think that...
if anything happened to me... I mean anything bad...
there wouldn't be any money for you ?
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.
You wouldn't even have pocket money.
Did you ever think of that ?
Yeah, I've thought about that.
Why didn't you eat your dinner ?
Because I'm afraid. You made me afraid.
I thought you were supposed to be the big girl in this family.
Nothing wrong with it.
You're just a neurotic, Blanche.
You know what ? You're just a neurotic.
Good morning Elvira.
Good morning.
Oh, please Jane. I'm so hungry.
I have to go now.
But just a little, please.
No. You didn't eat your din din so you'll have to wait til lunch time.
Oh, Jane please. Don't do this to me. Jane, please.
Good morning Elvira.
Good morning, Miss Jane.
I want to talk to you.
I want to apologize.
Apologize ?
Yeah. I wasn't feeling so well yesterday.
So I was unkind to you.
I want to make it up.
I got up this morning and fixed the house.
So you can have the whole day off.
Here's your 15 dollars.
Well thanks. But does Miss...
What I mean is, does Miss Blanche know about my taking the day off ?
Oh sure. She knows.
Alright, if you say so. See you next Tuesday then.
Yeah, have a good time.
Bye.
Bye.
Who was that at the door earlier ?
Elvira.
Where is she now ? In the kitchen ?
No. I gave her the day off.
She has a pretty hard time considering.
I told her to come back next week.
Oh, Blanche.
You know we got rats in the cellar ?
Good afternoon.
Mr Flagg ?
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.
I have an appointment with a Miss Hudson for 4 o'clock.
I'm Jane Hudson.
You're right on time, aren't you ?
Yes, I believe I am.
Come in.
We can talk here in the living-room.
Oh, I say, what a perfectly charming room.
So you're Edwin Flagg.
Yes. That's right.
I'll bring in some tea. You like tea ?
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.
You must have guessed that I am English.
Oh really ? How nice for you.
Oh, here let me help you.
It's a terribly big burden for such a little girl.
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's so hot today. Did you drive here in your car ?
Well, actually, I took a cab.
A bit of a nuisance, but I had to put my car in for servicing.
Cream or lemmon ?
Cream.
Sugar ?
My, looks good.
I always think it's nice to break bread with strangers, don't you ?
Oh, yes. Yes indeed.
I don't think you actually mentioned the exact nature of...
Well I've been retired for some time now
and I've been taking care of someone in my family who is sick
And now you're free to return to your profession...
Yes
And what exactly... I mean, I take it you're a soloist.. some instrument... ?
I wonder if you can guess who I am.
Can you give me a hint ?
Well it's not really fair to make you guess.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson.
Oh.
Do you mean you're really the Baby Jane Hudson ?
Yes I am. And I'm going to revive my act exactly as I used to do it.
Of course some of the arrangements will have to be brought up to date...
Music changes so much, doesn't it ?
And they're desperate for new acts. Television, Las Vegas
and all the clubs. There are a lot of people who remember me. Lots of them.
I don't see how you could fail.
You know I have a kind of a feeling...
the minute I opened the door and saw you standing there.
I just knew we were going to be friends.
I've been thinking about costumes.
Costumes ?
Yes. I took some of my old ones down to be copied.
Do you think that's a good idea ?
Of course.
But I don't quite remember...
How silly of me, Edwin.
How could you. But I do want your opinion. I really do.
All my scrapbooks and stuff are in the rehearsal room where you can look at them
and tell me what you think.
You'd like to see them, wouldn't you ?
Why, of course.
Oh, I wish daddy could be here right now.
You can never lose your talent, he used to tell me.
You can lose everything else, but you can't lose your talent.
Come on.
I think you'll find these clippings very interesting.
Daddy saved them for me from the very first.
He used to put them in special books.
I always liked that picture. It's so...
... so sad.
You always spoil everything.
No, Jane. I just wanted to know...
Who is down there. I'll tell you.
I got a friend down there. Someone who's come to see me.
He doesn't even know you exist.
And you don't like that, do you ?
You're wrong Jane. I've always wanted you to have friends.
That's what I've always wanted, really.
Then how come I never had any ?
Maybe you weren't... I mean... Maybe you were just too independent.
No, that's not why. You always stopped me from having friends. That's why.
Not any more, Jane. Not any more.
I'm pleased that you have a friend.
That's what you need.
Oh, sure.
I was just hoping I could meet him and we could have a nice talk.
Just the three of us.
Yeah. You'd like that, wouldn't you.
Then you could tell him a whole lot of lies about me.
Scare him off... or maybe have him for yourself.
I've written a letter to daddy
His address is heaven above
It's wonderful !
I've written a letter to daddy
His address is heaven above
I've written dear daddy we miss you
And wish you were with us to love.
Instead of a stamp I'd put kisses
The postman says that's best to do
I've written a letter to daddy
Saying I love you
I've written a letter to daddy
Saying I love you.
Edwin, you certainly can play, can't you ?
And you certainly can sing.
Oh, thank you. I can see you've done this kind of work before.
No... not really. Actually I spend most of my time on serious music
composing and that sort of thing.
You mean this will be your first contact with show business ?
Not exactly.
You see, my father was quite well known as an actor.
In the movies ? Maybe I worked with him.
I shouldn't think so...
He's been dead quite a long time now.
I lost my daddy when I was quite young too.
Of course he was more in the classical tradition...
I mean as an actor... Shakespeare and that sort of thing...
People used to say daddy could have been a star in his own right.
He was a musician too.
What instrument ?
Piano and banjo.
Oh...
That's very interesting. The banjo is a very native American instrument.
My father was British.
But he never really got a chance out here in Hollywood.
That's too bad.
It's funny really,
because actually he came from a rather distinguished family, socially I mean...
Yet nearly all the parts he had were playing menials... butlers and such.
Oh, really ?
Yes.
I don't think my mother ever really appreciated what he was trying to do.
Oh, I know what you mean.
It's very hard for an artist when people don't understand.
I remember when...
I sometimes try to explain to her that if you're going to produce anything decent
in the way of serious music you must have the right atmosphere.
But of course, Delia can't understand that.
Delia ?
Who's Delia ?
You might not think it to look at her, but she's my mother.
For a minute I thought you had a wife
or a lady friend tucked away somewhere.
Oh, no. No...
Nothing like that.
How much were you actually thinking of paying me ?
Paying ?
Well, what do you think ?
How about $100 ?
A week, of course.
Alright. I think that would be fair.
Then that's settled.
I don't like talking about money, do you ?
No. It's not that important, is it ?
Not like relationships between people
But the thing is if I'm going to move out and give up my pupils
I will have to know for sure.
When do you think of starting ?
Just when would you let me have some money ?
Well...
I've got some family matters to take care of...
that should take about a week or so.
I don't see why we couldn't start rehearsing right away.
Tell you what, Edwin. I'll pay you first thing Wednesday.
A month in advance.
It's done.
How about going to dinner somewhere... somewhere nice ?
It sounds fine...
I'll tell you what. Why don't you come with me now
I've got to go down and pick up my costumes and we can go on to dinner from there.
I... promised my mo... Delia I'd be home for supper.
Oh.. I'll drive you home then.
I'm so excited.
You know, I know everything is going to go just marvelous...
I have to go up and change. I won't be a minute.
This is really a rather charming neighborhood.
Yes, I've always found it very pleasant.
I just can't wait to get started. We're going to be a great team the two of us.
I'm sure we are. I'll see you Wednesday.
Bye.
Bye.
This is Blanche... Blanche Hudson. I need your help.
Is the doctor there ? I must talk to him.
He's with a patient right now.
But I have to talk to him. I've got to.
Hold on, please. I'll see if I can interrupt him.
Dr. Shelby ?
Yes, Blanche. Miss Hill tells me you're a little upset.
What seems to be the trouble ?
You must help me. I need you here.
No, it's about my sister. I need your help.
I need you here. At the house.
No. It's nothing like that.
It's the way she's behaving.
You've got to come over right away.
Please. Before she comes back.
I don't quite understand.
Is this some kind of emotional disturbance you're talking about ?
Yes. She's emotionally disturbed.
She's unbalanced.
I don't know doctor. I mean...
Are you trying to tell me she's violent ?
Yes! Yes she is!
I'm not sure...
I... I don't...
Very well. We aren't getting anywhere like this.
I'll come over right away.
That was...
I know who it was.
No, Jane. It really was.
And I know what you're trying to do.
I'm not trying to do anything.
Honestly, Jane.
This is Blanche Hudson again.
Could I speak to the doctor ?
Oh yes, certainly. Hold on. I'll try to catch him.
Dr. Shelby.
Hello, Blanche. I'm on my way now.
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in time.
Dr. Shelby, we're noy going to meet you after all.
I know.
But Jane has gone to another doctor.
Another doctor ?
Yes, another doctor.
Well, of course if she's chosen to go to someone else.
After all, we really can't interfere, can we
if Jane's chosen to go to another doctor.
I'm very sorry.
Goodbye, doctor.
I thought I told you not to come back until next week.
I know you did, but I had a free day today
so I thought I'd come by and see if there was anything needed doing.
Well there isn't anything so you could have saved yourself the trouble.
I was going to write you a note but now you're here I might as well tell you.
We're not going to be needing you any more.
But I don't understand.
We're closing uo the house.
Blanche wants to take a smaller place at the beach.
The doctor thinks that's best for her, so that's what we're going to do.
Oh, don't worry. You'll be paid for today. I'll send you a check.
I'm not worried about any pay. I'd just like to see Miss Blanche before I go.
Well you can't.
She's asleep.
That's alright. I don't mind waiting.
Well I do, I gotta leave so just give me the keys to the house.
I'm sorry I don't have the keys. I must have left them at home.
Anyway, go. You're fired.
Miss Blanche !
Miss Blanche !
Miss Blanche. Are you awake ?
Miss Blanche ! Are you alright in there ?
Wait there and I'll go find the key.
Good morning Miss Hudson.
Good morning.
How's Miss Blanche these days ?
She's just fine.
Do you have a deposit slip ?
Well, Blanche wanted me to get it all in cash this time.
I guess she has some special reason.
Yes, but doesn't she normally... I mean...
if she isn't going to deposit her monthly check...
she usually gives us a call and tells us what she wants us to do, doesn't she ?
Didn't she call ?
I don't think so.
Well I guess she must still be asleep. She gave me that check last night.
I see. Just a moment please.
I guess that will be alright, Miss Hudson.
50s and 20s are alright ?
Yes, please.
There you are.
Thank you.
Bye, now.
Miss Blanche, I'll tell you right now.
If that sister of yours has gone and given you sleeping tablets
just to keep you quiet while she's out doing I don't know what
I'm sure as hell going to call the police on her.
Oh Miss Hudson.
I'm glad I caught you
I hope you don't mind but there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
What ?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm kind of short of help around the house
I was wondering if you would mind my asking
your cleaning lady if she could give me a couple of days a week.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, you can have her as often as you want.
My sister and I are moving so we won't want her anymore
but you have to call her. She isn't here. I've already sent her home.
But I just saw her.
Yes, but I sent her home.
But that's impossible. I saw her go in the house a few minutes ago.
In the house ?
Yes.
So you finally decided to come back ?
What are you doing here ?
I told you you were fired.
Never mind all that.
I wanna know what's going on around here.
You said you didn't have your key.
It just so happens that I did.
So now you can tell me what you mean by locking Miss Blanche in her room.
This isn't Blanche's house. It's my house and I can do as I like.
Doesn't make a difference whose house it is.
You've got to act like a grown woman, the same as everybody else.
Suppose there had been a fire with Miss Blanche locked up in her room like that.
Well, there wasn't.
You open that door and stop all this nonsense !
No !
Then give me the key.
No !
She's asleep. I gave her a pill.
You did ? Then you'd better give me that key and be quick about it.
I won't and you can't make me.
I'm not afraid of you.
Alright, Miss Hudson. I'm not going to fool with you.
If you won't give me that key I'll go right down and call the police.
You'll be sorry.
Give me that key.
I didn't mean her any harm.
Better not have done her any harm.
My God, Miss Blanche. What has she done to you ?
I'll get you off in a minute, Miss Blanche. Don't worry, Miss Blanche.
I'll get you down from here.
You just rest easy...
Going out, are you dear ?
You know I am.
Having dinner with her ?
Uh-huh
I'm forgotten. You won't be back too late, will you lovey ?
Who knows ?
You could have been better in all of them.
But they didn't want that.
They just didn't love you enough.
You know that they just didn't love you enough.
Edwin ?
Miss Hudson ?
I'm sorry, Edwin. I can't let you in. Not now.
Oh, to hell with it !
I can't let you in.
Not now.
What am I going to do ?
Oh, Miss Hudson... I thought... I didn't know there was anyone in here.
I just came home and I saw a light and I thought
you had left the lights of your car on.
You know, I've had that happen to me.
That's alright, Miss Bates.
I've had that happen to me once. It was no joke.
Wake up in the morning and find you have a dead battery. No joke.
Well, as long as everything is alright I guess I'll just say good night.
Good night.
That doesn't prove anything.
Now what do you think you'll do ?
I'll manage, lovey.
I suppose you think I'm making all this up.
I wouldn't know.
Well, Hazel should know, shouldn't she ?
She worked in the same studio and that's where it all happened.
Just after one of those studio parties and right in front of her own house.
Jane Hudson drove her car straight on her own sister
and crippled her for life.
Oh come on. You mean she tried to kill her ?
Yes, she did. She tried to murder her own sister.
How is it they didn't arrest her then ?
They would have. But the studio had it all tapped because of Blanche Hudson's career.
That sounds very likely.
Yes, so the fine woman you've chosen to run around with has got to be broke.
And a murderer as well !
I see !
Well it's true !
If it's true I'll ask her about it when I see her again. How's that ?
You wouldn't see a woman like that again.
Why not ? You just told me she's got a rich sister.
You haven't heard the worst of it yet.
You mean there's more ?
Yes there is.
After she'd run down her own sister
your precious Jane Hudson ran off and left her there to die
like some poor animal. She ran off and disappeared for 3 whole days.
What happened then ? Don't tell me they couldn't find her.
Oh, they found her alright.
They found her in some hotel room with a man she had never even seen before.
Why should that upset you ?
Isn't that how I was conceived ?
Hello.
Yes this is Miss Hudson.
She left.
About a week ago.
We have a report here filed by her cousin listing her as a missing person.
Did she tell you what her plans were or anything like that ?
No, I don't know a thing.
Well, we have a couple of other addresses to check. Maybe we'll come up with something.
Otherwise, we'll probably be getting in touch with you again.
Meanwhile, if you do hear from her we'd appreciate you letting us know.
Blanche !
Blanche !
The police are looking for Elvira.
It wasn't my fault. She wouldn't leave me alone.
I don't know what to do Blanche. What am I going to do ?
What am I going to do ?
If they find her, we'll have to run away.
That's what we'll do. We'll just go away.
Oh, but then I wouldn't see Edwin anymore.
He wouldn't like what I did.
It wasn't my fault, but he wouldn't like what I did.
I don't care. We'll go to the beach. We'll live by the seashore all the time like we used to.
When I was little and daddy was there.
And maybe we'll have friends...
People would come and see us...
Oh, I'd like that.
Blanche.
Blanche, listen to me.
You know I always wanted everything to be nice, don't you ?
I don't see how Elvira could make me do a thing like that.
I just don't understand.
It was like that time in the hotel room
when they came and told me you were hurt and that I'd done it.
And there was a big man there... a policeman...
and he hit me and he slapped me and I tried to tell him that
I couldn't do a thing like that. Not to my own sister...
Jane.
He said I was a liar.
The accident...
No, it wasn't an accident.
I did it. You told me so yourself.
I must tell you...
I don't want to talk about it.
Everytime I think of something nice you remind me of the bad things.
I only want to talk about the nice things.
Remember when daddy and I used to rehearse at the beach ?
I'd be dancing on the sand. And all the people would come and watch.
All crowd around to see Baby Jane Hudson.
What'll I do ?
Let them in...
The police ?
It may be Edwin.
Of course. It's Edwin.
Edwin !
You aren't gonna tell on me.
No Jane, please...
There !
Edwin !
Edwin.
Wait for me.
Miss Jane Hudson ?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Miss Hudson,  but we just picked up this young man in front of your house.
Says he's on his way in to see you. Is that right ?
I don't understand.
They're trying to say I'm drunk.
Let's just say you're a little happy, ok ?
Who's happy ?
I'm not happy.
So now you know.
That's right. So now we know.
Sorry to have bothered you Miss Hudson. Good night.
I have the money. Really I have. But don't be mean to me.
You promised me.
I know I did, and I have the money.
Look, let's go in the kitchen and have a drink together.
It's nice there, and then we can be friends again, and everything.
I've got something else for you too.
What ?
It's a surprise.
Would you like to have a...
You're gonna like your present.
You're really gonna like it. Drink your drink, Edwin.
I'll go get it for you.
This is my very own. It's a genuine Baby Jane doll.
I used to give them to all my really good friends.
The people that I worked with.
They made them for me.
Marvelous.
...specially...
Very lifelike.
Now Jane, you talk to nice Mr Flagg
and nice Mr Flagg will have his money in a minute.
Oh, you're not comfy like that, are you ?
Let's go bye-bye.
Here comes the superchief !
Edwin ! Edwin ! Stop it !
What was that ?
Nothing. I didn't do anything.
Edwin. Edwin. Please...
She'll take you away from me !
Please. Help me.
Please. Help me.
She's dying.
For God's sake ! She's dying.
Get away from me !
Edwin ! I've got your money !
Edwin ! Do come back ! Your money !
He hates me...
He hates me.
Stop !
He's going to tell...
He's going to tell !
Blanche ! Blanche !
You've got to help me.
We've got to leave.
Please, please, Blanche.
Help me.
I like this place.
We can just sit here for awhile
and pretty soon the sun will come up and it will be nice.
You should look at the sea.
It has all lights on it.
You used to like that.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
At 11:25 this morning all local law enforcement agencies
have assigned special details to the kidnap slaying mystery
that surrounds the famed Hudson sisters.
It is beleived that Blanche Hudson. film great of the early 30s,
has been forcibly abducted by her sister
Hey Ernie, get a load of this...
from the family home on North McGavin in Hollywood
some time between the hours of 10 p,m. and 10:30 p.m. last evening.
With the exception of one witness
who reportedly saw the Hudson car, a 1940 or 1941 black convertible
heading West on Wilshire and Santa Monica
no report has been recieved to date...
So they found that colored woman ?
Yeah, they found her alright.
Sure is a rotten way to get your picture in the papers.
You reckon they'll ever find that Baby Jane or whatever her name is ?
Yes, we'll find her. But I guess maybe it'll be too late.
Oh, Officer. There's a car down there parked right on the road.
I almost got stuck in the sand when I tried to get around it.
You mean that old Lincoln convertible ?
That's right.
It was parked over there when we opened up this morning.
The keys are there, but I didn't want to move it. I thought maybe...
What do you figure ?
Cops ? How do you figure cops ?
This is it.
You must be hot.
Jane.
Help me.
I'm afraid...
Find someone. A doctor.
I can't.
If I die...
you'll be alone.
But they'd be mean to me like they were before.
I don't want to hear.
Jane, I'm dying.
There's no time.
You must listen.
I made you waste your whole life
Thinking you had crippled me.
Please stop.
You didn't do it, Jane.
I did it myself.
Don't you understand ?
I crippled myself.
You weren't driving that night.
You weren't driving.
You were too drunk.
I wouldn't let you drive.
I made you go open the gates.
I watched you get out of the car
You had been so cruel to me at the party.
Imitating me... making people laugh at me...
I watched you get out of the car
I wanted to run you down.
crush you... But you saw the car coming.
I hit the gates
snapped my spine...
Then you mean...
all this time we could have been friends ?
You were frightened.
You ran away.
I managed to crawl out of the car up to the gates...
When they found me
they assumed it was your fault.
You were so drunk... confused... you didn't know any better.
You weren't ugly then.
I made you that way.
I even did that.
There's a place up there that sells things.
You like ice cream.
I'll get you some.
Yeah ?
Do you have ice cream ?
Yes, what flavor ?
Vanilla, coffee, strawberry, lemon...
Strawberry, strawberry, please. Two big strawberries, please.
That'll be 40 cents !
Thanks...
Right. You'd better send some more help.
Miss Hudson !
We've been looking all over for you Miss Hudson.
I'm sorry, but we must find your sister.
Is she down here in the beach with you ?
Yes she is.
I'll take these for you.
Oh no, they're mine.
They're for my sister Blanche.
She's going to be a movie star, you know ?
That's right, Miss. We want to find your sister because I think maybe she needs help.
I think maybe she's in trouble.
Would you show us where she is, please ?
Won't you take us to her ?
Please, Miss Hudson.
