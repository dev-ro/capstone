EAST BERLIN
My name is Harry Melchior. 
This is my story. 
A true story. 
On August 26, 1961,
I left my country. 
If you want to call it that. 
I left the eastern part of Berlin. 
Howdy.
Howdy.
But my story really starts
two weeks earlier.
On August 12, '61.
One day before the wall was built.
A good start for the 100 meters. 
TWO WEEKS EARLIER
It was the last chance
for the German Freestyle Championship. 
And Lotte was so proud. 
Lotte is my sister... 
and my biggest fan. 
Comrades, this race is-
It's a world-class race. 
Come on, Harry Melchior
Matthis was also there,
my closest and best friend,
Matthis, the engineer. 
He already knew what was happening,
and the next day,
everyone else did, too. 
Harry Melchior is on his way
to becoming the champion. 
If he keeps this up, we'll have
a new swimmer in the GDR.
Harry Melchior is the German champion
Super!
They're taking bricks from my site.
- Why?
- Don't you know what that means?
They're building the wall.
It's only a rumor.
Now just enjoy yourself!
At first I thought it was wrong
to enter another race. 
But it wasn't. 
It was the right thing to do. 
It was my win,
and my plan worked. 
I was able to aggravate them all. 
Especially the functionaries. 
I was arrested in the June Rebellion
of 1953 and spent four years in prison. 
I had waited years for this moment. 
What's your brother up to?
It was a matter of
freedom and honor to me. 
And that's what keeps me going. 
All combat units in Berlin
have assembled in Stalinallee. 
Their commander, Comrade Ludenstein,
has reported to the State Council. 
All attempts to break through
the border of the GDR have been foiled. 
THE TUNNEL
They were nipped in the bud
by increased border security. 
Then Walter Ulbricht said,
"Along with other Warsaw Pact states,
we have promised to do everything
to stop militarists provoking
another world war from German soil. "
That was also the purpose of the
operation at the Brandenburg Gate. 
EAST BERLIN
We couldn't believe it, but GDR soldiers
closed the border to West Berlin. 
What will you do now, champion?
Keep on swimming?
Keep on studying
as if nothing had happened?
Matthis, please. Let's go.
I won't go without Lotte.
I won't leave my sister here alone.
Harry, they'll do you in.
Do you want to
go through all that again?
All over again?
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING WEST BERLIN
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING WEST BERLIN
It is our duty,
using peaceful political means,
to stand up
for all peoples’ and nations'
basic right to self-determination. 
Matthis and Carola had decided. 
The same night, they joined a group
trying to escape via the sewers. 
Stop!
We go that way. Quick!
Carola! This way!
- Where are the others?
- With you, I thought.
Carola! Carola!
Matthis, run
Run
Matthis and Carola were split up. 
Matthis had lost everything
but his freedom. 
He went underground in West Berlin
and contacted other escape helpers. 
We'd like to make you an offer. 
Our state looks after
its top sports stars.
They receive good housing
and a decent salary.
Nice of you.
Mr. Melchior,
I'd like to congratulate you.
Fantastic.
I'm Colonel Krüger from State Security.
I deal with illegal immigration.
I'm investigating
Matthis Hiller's escape.
- You were friends?
- We still are.
Times are tough.
People fall victim to the West's lure
and leave family and friends behind.
They are blind to our new society.
All right.
I give you a friendly warning:
Don't do anything stupid.
I highly respect your achievements.
I'll keep track of your further career.
I truly hope we won't lose you.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Now I'm the German champion.
But I'm somehow too old for this stuff.
I announce my retirement
as a national athlete.
Have that man arrested, comrade.
My patience is at an end.
It was the point of no return. 
I had to leave. 
And Lotte had to go with me. 
- What did they say?
- They love me.
They never want to let me go.
I told you they wouldn't
let you get away with it.
They have another reason.
- You gotta leave.
- Will you come along?
- No.
- Then I'll stay.
I can't leave.
And Theo won't.
And Ina's too young.
It's too dangerous.
And anyway,
it's impossible now.
Matthis got in touch.
A student will meet you
at the Odeon tomorrow at 11:00.
- You'll get a passport.
- Not without you.
Yes! And promise to get us out
when Ina is older.
Promise you'll get us out.
Promise you'll get us out.
It's all right.
I promise.
Then go.
Some degenerate subjects,
who have to appear
before the Supreme Court... 
Matthis Hiller sends his regards.
... walled in Berlin's human pitfall. 
- Are you -
- Vittorio.
They call me Vic.
Jesus!
The Zoopalast is showing
something better:
Marilyn Monroe, Misfits. 
Your papers for tomorrow,
Checkpoint Charlie.
On August 26, 1961,
I left my country. 
This is my story. 
Howdy.
When did you enter the GDR?
At noon today, around 12:30.
- The reason for your visit?
- I'm a tourist.
Thanks.
Good-bye.
Mr. Teller? Ulf Teller?
Tellier, it's French.
You look like a student.
I thought you were an athlete.
An educated athlete.
So, welcome to Canaan.
Fred von Klausnitz. Fred.
- Harry Melchior.
- I need the passport. We have -
You're really handsome.
Hungry for spaghetti?
We made it.
- Harry.
- Matthis.
Hey, Harry.
Thanks.
Thank those two.
I hardly did a thing.
I remember.
The Greeks say "rigano,"
and the Italians say "oregano. "
Where's Carola?
What happened?
What do you think?
I made it. She didn't.
That's what happened.
Come on in.
Have a seat.
- How was the Marilyn Monroe movie?
- Okay. A bit depressing. Monroe is wow.
- "Wow?"
- Terrific.
- Here's to freedom.
- To freedom.
To freedom.
To freedom.
- Why do you do this?
- I was 10-
Not that old story again.
We fled from Italy to America.
Dad was a Communist.
I marched into Berlin
with the army in '45.
Private Castanza from Eugene, Oregon.
I wanted to make history,
but Berlin was already freed.
A week later, Private Castanza
stepped on a forgotten mine.
Leg gone, discharged,
stuck in Berlin.
And then?
Bohemia.
Art, culture, women, alcohol
and the liberation
of Berlin's other half.
I'm writing a script.
I'll sell it as a screenplay.
- To Hollywood.
- To Hollywood. What's funny about that?
- What are your plans?
- I'm gonna bring my sister over.
How sweet.
Max Grüner.
- Harry Melchior?
- We said no photos!
Famous people are always good.
I'd like to talk to you.
Congratulations.
They really canned you.
But that's not the peg.
We'll use the June Rebellion '53.
They jailed you, didn't they?
Sure, I was there.
On the way home.
But I wasn't alone.
There were thousands.
Yeah, but...
I can't write
"on your way home. "
People want a martyr:
Communists torturing people.
You were tortured, right?
- Sure.
- Then tell about it.
We got enough
creeps like you over there
who want to know everything.
Especially what's not their business.
And what's worse,
you guys enjoy it.
The guest suite.
You can stay here at first.
Here's a blanket.
Sink and toilet are upstairs.
If you have any problems,
Matthis will help you.
Thanks.
Regarding your sister, forget it.
Passports for families are impossible.
What now?
No idea.
I don't know what they'll do to her.
If I'll ever see her again.
I shouldn't have let her go.
TEMPORARY IDENTITY CARD
- Bye.
- Bye.
2.90 an hour, net wage.
I promised Lotte.
They've already blocked off
every known escape route.
The sewer, the river bank.
There's no way out.
We'll use an unknown escape route.
Like what?
Here, engineer.
Ever worked with one of these?
One post after the other
at Potsdam Square. 
It'll take an incredible amount
of organizing to do it right.
You need tools, slag heaps
and at least 10 to 20 men
working in shifts.
- Alone, it'll take years.
- So it'll take us years.
Carola is in prison.
Should I just march in there
and get her out?
I thought you were the engineer.
It would be your masterpiece.
FREEDOM
Attention Attention
This is the "Barbed Wire Studio. "
Soldiers of the National People's Army
This is the voice of truth
and common sense. 
Citizens of West Berlin. 
It can neither be justified
by your conscience or by law. 
You won't hush us up. 
Your ridiculous
"Barbed Wire Station"
is slanderously
incriminating our people. 
The whole place
isn't worth a cent anymore. 
I've been trying for ages to sell
the property, but a location like this!
It's dead along the sector border.
Absolutely dead.
Ulbricht is the biggest criminal since
Hitler, as sure as I'm Hilde Meckel.
What magazine are you from?
We're not journalists.
No? So you're kind of investors?
Kind of. We'd like to see the cellar.
Come with me, gentlemen.
You see...
there are 350 square meters down there.
And next door, another 500.
Okay.
Careful.
Want to look at the next level?
- Huh?
- Yes.
Don't fall down.
What are your plans?
Stamped clay.
- It's good.
- There must be one more.
From here to Schönwalder,
right underneath the sector boundary.
- Is the groundwater deep enough?
- I think so.
You're all a bit crazy,
aren't you?
Good heavens.
Wait till I tell Alfons about this.
It's better not to tell anybody.
Do whatever you like.
I don't know nothing, okay?
Come on, supervisor.
What's the tunnel gonna look like?
Move that away.
We start here.
We have to dig down seven meters
underneath the sewer.
Then 145 meters straight ahead,
underneath the intersection.
It's 53 meters to the sector boundary.
That means 92 meters into East Berlin.
If it works out all right,
we'll come out here.
7 Schönwalder St.
92 meters into East Berlin!
Jesus Christ,
you guys are nuts!
I'm with you.
145 meters...
- Not such a good idea, huh?
- Hold on.
This is the only chance
to get my mother out.
My father was executed in '44
for high treason. I was six.
Then the Russians came.
To them,
German aristocrats are all traitors.
Only my mother and I survived.
And because of her aristocratic descent,
she's the class enemy personified.
I'm going to get her out of there.
Even if I have to use a spoon
to dig my way to Siberia.
Understand?
- Raise your glasses, men.
- I'm drunk already.
You stay here.
"Raise your glasses," I said.
And not a word to anybody,
or we don't have to bother starting again.
Not a word...
Not a word to anybody.
What are we gonna
dig with anyway?
Here.
Hey there, friends!
Everybody out!
Hey, Harry.
This could take months, you realize?
- Yep.
- If they catch us, we'll land in jail.
And where there's lightning,
there's thunder.
If I catch you here once more,
I'll tear you apart!
"Stick together. "
That's what Comrade Ulbricht said
a few days ago.
That we all have to stick together.
What hurts me most
is that we need a new department
for illegal emigration.
And it only exists,
because we don't all stick together.
But I am convinced our work is useful.
It is directed towards the future.
You understand?
A small step towards a better world.
I'm afraid your brother
turned his back on us.
A remarkable man.
We supported his athletic development
as best we could.
I've been wondering about you.
Questions of this nature
could shatter my faith in this country.
- Can you understand that?
- Of course.
You're very close
to your brother, aren't you?
- If you say so.
- That's nice, but it worries us.
How do you picture
your near future?
I have a husband I love and
a daughter I'm responsible for.
Please, have a seat.
- I have nothing more to say.
- Sit down.
Uncle Harry had dinner with us,
and then Mommy cried.
Why did she cry?
Because Daddy said that
Uncle Harry was taking a trip.
I see. Did Daddy say
where Uncle Harry was going?
If you could take a trip,
where would you like to go?
I wouldn't take a trip.
I want to go to Mommy.
They think Harry's coming to get us out.
So what?
Well, nothing.
What do we want to go there for?
We'd have no more than we have here.
Lotte, I've got a job.
- We've got friends and a nice apartment.
- I know.
We'd have the wall over there, too.
So tell me, why go over there?
NO TRESPASSING
PARENTS LIABLE FORTHEIR CHILDREN
Vic?
Presto. It's good.
Does it hurt?
- Five meters.
- Just a second. It's exactly 4.75.
All right, get on with it.
Five meters.
I've marked it for you.
WE REMAIN FAITHFUL TO OUR GDR
- 145 meters.
- Let's go.
Okay, let's go.
Carola Langensiep.
Well...
What's it going to be?
Here. A boy, right?
Not so important.
Main thing, it's healthy.
I had a daughter.
Died at the age of three.
Carola.
You don't want your child
to be born in prison.
How often have we talked?
I'm just as disgusted by all this.
This falseness...
that forces me to lie.
But the facts are different here.
I can help you. Really.
This -
This is definitely the very last thing
that I can do for you.
Carola, I really want to help you.
"... as informant... "
You are being evacuated
for reasons of security. 
Please report to the officer in charge. 
Lohmann.
Lohmann.
You're being sent to Zwickau.
But we're moving to Köpenick.
- It's all been arranged.
- No.
We have relatives in Köpenick.
Here is our authorization.
Lotte!
Come here.
Can you help me?
You mean Hermine Lohmann
in Köpenick?
That's right.
- Someone's there.
- Kids?
No!
I want to help.
Jesus!
Are you always so rough?
- How did you get in?
- The door is open.
We can't let her go.
- What now?
- We'll keep her here.
Not every stranger is an informer.
Not every stranger
snoops around in a deserted factory.
- Cut it out.
- May I say something, too?
I overheard you guys talking
at the "Capri" a few days ago.
And I followed you.
- You see?
- Get to the point.
I want to get my fiancé out.
If you don't mind.
Hands off, buddy!
Don't worry.
- Who's this?
- My fiancé.
With a "Free German Youth" shirt?
Who?
You know how it is.
I know you from the papers.
The champion swimmer who was in prison,
and then you became a loyal comrade.
I'm gonna get my boyfriend out
with or without you.
- You're crazy!
- 'Cause she's a girl?
- If you like!
- She's pretty.
Bullshit!
- I just don't trust her.
- Can we get started now?
Just wonderful.
What're you staring at?
Just 'cause I look different
than you when I'm naked
doesn't mean I can't work like you.
Aunt Hermine,
we're living with you now.
That's just wonderful,
my dear little Ina.
I told you things'd be okay.
- What's so good about this?
- It could've been worse, right?
Yeah.
Come on, get out.
Come on now!
Excuse me,
I'm looking for-
I'm new here.
Don't know my way around.
- You don't know?
- No.
"That was Vittorio, a good friend.
Write to Fritz Müller. Love, Harry. "
What's the big idea?
Do we have to do everything alone?
No, I'm coming!
Matthis said we have to shore it up.
It's none of your business.
What do you have against me?
I don't trust you.
I don't think you trust anybody.
Vic!
Again!
His mouth is full.
Get him on his side.
Get some water, Vic!
Are you crazy?
Have you gone totally insane?
Why do I make all those calculations
if you bastards don't stick to 'em?
Jesus!
You both could've died.
You realize that?
Fuck you!
We can't go on like this.
We need more people.
- There are informers everywhere.
- We're too slow.
- One informer and we'd be done for.
- But this could take 10 years!
I've saved about 1,000 marks.
- Who do you wanna get out?
- A girlfriend.
My father and my wife.
My younger brother.
He's all alone over there.
- My wife and kids.
- How many kids?
Two. Ralf is five.
Christina is eight.
My daughter.
- Who do you wanna get out?
- No one in particular.
Why do you want to take part?
He got us out back then,
through the sewer.
That policeman?
Holy shit! Get him outta here!
- I deserted.
- Sure, I've heard that before.
Damn it!
He risked his life to get me out.
I want to make up
for the three people who got caught.
My wife, my kids and my mother. 
If possible, a friend.
- And?
- My friend's family.
We have 10 candidates
who want to get 27 people out.
Plus our five makes 32.
It's worth at least it.
In Germany, it goes,
"At least it's worth it. "
I wanna go home.
I'm afraid we can't go home.
You can put this on your head
like an umbrella.
That isn't an umbrella.
It's a stupid scarf.
I know.
- There's enough room under my umbrella.
- Thank you.
Beef?
Do you live around here?
- We got stranded here since Matthis left.
- I understand.
Then we have something in common.
Heard anything from Matthis?
- What month?
- Sixth.
Sixth.
Does Matthis know about it yet?
Sorry.
I didn't want to pry.
Doesn't matter.
I'll answer the door, Mom
Didn't we take today off?
Yes, we did.
I... well...
You...
Well, I guess you saved my life.
And I thought...
Thank you.
Funeral flowers -
Who's there?
- Hello.
- So that's Heiner.
So you made it!
Thank God.
Give him a hug.
Please.
Heiner, this is my mother.
Mom, this is Heiner.
Hello.
Hello.
Come on in.
What's all this fuss about?
I just wanted to say thanks.
That's all she's talked about
for weeks.
Heiner this, Heiner that.
The tenants know all about it.
Okay, I'll pretend I'm Heiner,
but only if we go dancing.
- I don't know how.
- Doesn't matter.
Here we are.
- Real coffee.
- Mom, we've had real coffee for years.
Exactly. Like I said.
Real coffee.
Actually, I shouldn't.
Because of my heart.
Now tell me.
How'd you trick those border guards?
Yes, well...
Grossglienicke.
There's only barbed wire, loads of it.
And I got stuck.
My God.
- They didn't notice?
- Sure they did. They came with dogs.
But some guys from the West
pulled me over.
My God.
That could've gone wrong.
- You bet.
- What would they have done to you?
They'd have arrested me...
and hit me.
In the face, on the arms.
They probably would have just
bruised me. But that hurts like hell.
Then off to State Security.
Solitary confinement.
No heating, no blankets,
but lights everywhere...
everywhere.
Every four hours an interrogation.
"Western contacts?"
"Yes? No? Yes?"
And then...
they start to hit you again.
But much harder this time.
Broken nose, broken arms,
head wounds.
But that isn't the worst.
The worst is...
you gotta watch out
so you don't get pneumonia.
And...
And...
And when you can finally
fall asleep again...
Yeah, but they didn't catch me.
Yes...
thank goodness.
- What are you staring at?
- Oh, come on.
You didn't learn that in jail, did you?
- What?
- That Elvis stuff?
That isn't Elvis.
It's Chubby Checker.
Anyway, I wasn't always in jail
in the German Democratic Republic.
I went dancing now and then, too.
Oh, really?
Heiner and I always wanted
to go to a dance hall.
But then they just went and
"bang, boom" closed off the border.
From one day to the next.
We'll get all of them out,
and then we'll all go dancing.
Got a girlfriend over there, too?
You'd like to know, huh?
The only girl who stood by me
was Lotte.
When I was in prison, she kept getting
on their nerves until they let me out.
It took four years.
Paul Verner told the armed workers
returning to factories and families
to increase their vigilance
and readiness to fight. 
How is Harry doing?
Okay.
This is Carola.
She's coming with us.
Very charming.
That means the West will soon
have the prettiest girls.
They marched along Stalin Boulevard
and demonstrated
that peace is in good hands. 
Oh, well.
He's never written long letters,
but he's so sweet.
- What is he planning?
- No idea.
When did you enter the GDR?
This afternoon at 4:00.
- The reason for your visit?
- I'm a tourist.
Castanza, Vittorio?
Yes?
Please, come with us.
Thank you, but I already have a date.
You're on GDR territory.
If you flee,
- we have the right to use firearms.
- I'm a tourist. And I'm going home.
- With or without my passport.
- You'd better cooperate.
You can't harass a US citizen.
You're going to pay for this.
I've called every hospital. Nothing.
There's only one possibility.
But he wouldn't ever tell a thing,
even if tortured by the Inquisition.
Somebody must have squealed on him.
Take it off. Come on.
Everything.
- There you are.
- Good evening.
I'm Colonel Krüger.
And you're?
Vittorio Castanza.
Please, get dressed.
I'll inform the American Embassy-
Mr. Castanza,
let's forget the funny stuff.
So my passport is okay.
I can go now.
You know exactly why you're here.
No.
It's written all over your face.
Why should I feel guilty
towards you or your country?
If you had no respect, you wouldn't
secretly meet Charlotte Lohmann.
Charlotte Lohmann?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Mr. Castanza,
- you gave Mrs. Lohmann an envelope.
- That's what you say.
What was in that letter?
I don't know anything about a letter.
What a shame.
- The coast is clear. Move it. 
- Okay.
Attention. Here's rail.
Keep it moving, move it.
Good, move it.
Mom?
Sorry.
I thought you were my sister.
You were dreaming.
I never had a brother.
I'd like to know what it's like...
to have a brother.
Brothers are lots of work.
Do you miss Heiner?
My mom is dead.
Made herself some coffee,
and fell down and died.
Fritzi! Fred!
Yeah, concrete.
Solid as a rock.
On the other side
is a sewer full of shit.
I thought Matthis
made precise calculations.
He has an East German slide rule.
And an elastic ruler.
Blasted elastic.
There were no concrete walls
in the sewer plans.
You don't seem to care
what happened to Vic.
Bullshit.
He didn't cross Checkpoint Charlie.
I asked everybody.
If they don't all come over soon,
it'll be a diplomatic scandal.
A Bosch sledgehammer, electric.
Top German quality.
- Where from?
- From Adenauer.
My cousin's vice president
of a construction company.
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. He doesn't ask questions.
- Is he cute?
- What are you getting at?
Jesus! Don't make a sound!
They got one of those things. 
They're picking up sounds. 
- What's up?
- They're trying to tap us.
They're bringing in a busload.
Something's in the make.
Turn off the motor!
Turn off the motor!
Turn off the motor!
Turn off the motor!
Halt!
Come on up.
You gotta take a look at this.
That's one way.
They have their method.
And we have ours.
Nobody's going to shoot at us.
I hope not.
Where's Harry?
Taking advantage of this.
Mommy, Mommy,
we're moving to Zwickau.
- Let's go.
- I'm being sent as cadre leader. 
It's a responsible job.
And it suits my abilities.
We'd get a four-room apartment
in a new housing development.
Not everybody gets an offer
like that from Sachsenring.
Daddy, what's that?
That's a really big factory, my dear.
They build cars.
And Daddy gets to build cars, too.
- Will you build us a car?
- Sure thing.
- In a year, we'll have a Trabant.
- Don't you see what they want?
I'll wash the dishes.
Come on, dear. Help me.
- It's our chance!
- They're banishing us to Zwickau.
Away from Berlin.
Buttering you up.
You still wanna leave?
Oh, Theo.
- I don't know what I want.
- But I know.
Harry.
You're still in touch with him, right?
- Yes.
- Yes!
Fritzi, you think of everything.
Not everything. Just this.
You don't know how nice it is to be here.
What did they do to you?
Let's get to work, okay?
What did they do to you?
They nabbed me...
at Checkpoint Charlie.
It was so cold.
- But what did they do to you?
- Nothing! They did nothing to me!
They just waited -
They just waited for me to go crazy!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- It's nice you're back.
- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
When the damn tunnel is finished
and the others are here,
- we'll celebrate.
- With Carola and the baby.
- Got a picture?
- Sure.
I spent the last few Christmases
with Lotte, Theo and little Ina.
I was with my mom.
Pretty.
Look.
Carola was at the movies. 
Only she and Lotte saw me.
And I got arrested at the Checkpoint.
- That doesn't prove anything.
- They gave her probation. Why?
For information. That's logical.
- As an informer?
- Yeah.
Don't tell Matthis or Harry.
I'm not that stupid.
They probably threatened
to take away her baby.
- We should put out our feelers.
- Who goes?
You're a West German.
They'll let you go across.
Hello.
Well, are you nervous?
Mrs. Charlotte Lohmann?
The flowers are from
the child's father.
- Best regards for Carola.
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
"Watch out for Carola Langensiep!
She probably sold Vittorio out
to State Security.
Lead her astray.
Tell her the tunnel goes
from Koch St. To Schützen St. "
We'll zigzag from here.
- What?
- We'll zigzag from here.
So they don't have a direct shot.
I don't wanna get shot in the back.
- It's difficult with the rails.
- It sure is.
My God. How beautiful.
- His little fingers.
- I'll call him Matthis.
- So at least I'll have one Matthis.
- Just wait. You'll soon have two.
Any news?
It'll take a few weeks.
- And how?
- I don't know.
Could be lots of different ways.
They only named a place.
What place?
That's the exact spot Lotte told Carola.
Fred has to go back again
right away.
A boy...
I have a boy.
- His name is Matthis.
- Congratulations.
- I have a boy.
- You'll be a good father.
Congratulations.
She named him Matthis.
Yeah, terrific.
They're doing well.
I know what you're thinking.
I've noticed it the whole time.
She'd never do that.
Never, not Carola.
We put her to the test.
It's beyond a doubt.
I don't blame her.
Sure, the prison veteran
held out for four years,
but Carola would never hold out.
Arrogant asshole!
- We put her to the test.
- She's no informer!
I'm sorry, Matthis.
"Who's Harry?
See you Wednesday. "
Come on in.
Let's go for a walk.
Yes.
My God.
- Why?
- Doesn't matter.
- There's no excuse.
- I want to know why, Carola.
They'd have let me bear the child,
then they'd have taken him away.
He blackmailed you.
They could have ended up
in prison, or even dead.
Does Matthis know?
Carola, I like you.
I still want you to be my friend.
I want to be able to trust you.
Lotte, you can trust me.
You can trust me.
Let's talk.
Go away!
It can't go on like this.
- I know how you feel.
- You always know everything.
You always know everything!
You know nothing!
Shit! Nothing!
It isn't your problem.
It's mine.
It's my problem,
so get lost. Fuck off!
- It isn't your fault.
- Go away, damn it!
I spent everything
on the sledgehammer. 
- You bought it?
- Yep. It was the only solution.
I owe five months' rent.
They threw me out.
No problem.
You can have Harry's room.
- With Matthis?
- Yeah.
No, thanks.
- You forgot to fill up.
- How? I haven't eaten for two days.
What's the wall doing here?
Did you drive the wrong way?
Bullshit.
Thank you.
Good heavens. What's that?
- They're making a movie about us.
- Without us.
Maybe they'll make a deal.
- Wow!
- Yep!
I hope you can keep a secret.
Sorry, you got the wrong guy.
We make feature films.
But I know somebody...
who can keep his mouth shut.
5,000 dollars for each of you.
Plus the financial guarantee
that the tunnel is completed.
Guaranteed by NBC.
No.
What we're doing is beyond price.
Everything has its price.
Show us the tunnel now.
These clowns will never hold back
the story until we're done.
It's too late already.
We already know.
15,000 for each of us.
We call that blackmail.
And you?
So you're the nut
who wants to get his sister out.
And she's worth 15,000 dollars to you?
We can do business,
but I won't let you insult me.
Mr. McLeod agrees.
Provided you don't show up.
Let us know.
Mr. Meyer-
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
Keep going up.
Just wait, Harry.
McLeod will calm down.
Don't show up for a few days.
I'll handle it.
- You're throwing me out?
- Come on, Harry.
Consider it a strategic retreat.
Two or three days.
Do you have to do that now?
Maybe it isn't a tunnel.
I told you -
Maybe you don't know!
What's the deal?
- Maybe I can't trust you?
- I told you everything -
That isn't what I asked!
Perhaps I overestimated
your relationship to Mrs. Lohmann.
Or underestimated it?
Stay clear of her now.
- What?
- Case dismissed.
- But why?
- Thank you, Miss Langensiep.
You'll remain at our disposal.
