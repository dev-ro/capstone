Hi, Howard.
Allie. Jeez.
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Just thought I'd drop in.
God, that's so funny
because, you know...
...I was just thinking about you.
I saw your show on TV.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
What I had to do to get them
to turn off the ballgame.
This Alfred Miller. He's my friend.
He's a big TV writer.
This is Margo, the big waitress.
- How are you?
- Pleased to meet you.
Listen, I thought before the dinner
rush, we could take a walk.
Play a little chess or something.
Sure. Marg?
- Can you take over the register?
- Sure, Howard.
I mean, unless you're too busy.
For you?
Are you kidding?
- It's good to see you.
- You too.
- Hey, Howard.
- Yeah?
What's the price on
the Kid Gavilan-Basilio fight?
- It's 8-to-5, Gavilan.
- I'll take Basilio five times.
Okay, you got it.
You never change.
It's your move.
Howard, I can't work anymore.
Yeah?
What, like writer's block?
No.
- Well, what? You're not sick, are you?
- I'm blacklisted.
- Yeah, all right, but you feel okay.
- I feel terrible.
But you're healthy,
besides your ulcer.
Howard, they won't buy my scripts.
I'm on a blacklist.
You know what that means?
It's a list of names. The studios have
them, the networks, the ad agencies.
You're on the list, you're marked.
You don't work.
So, what difference does
it make if I'm healthy?
Well, you know,
it makes a difference.
So, what are you blacklisted for?
- I'm a communist sympathizer.
- Well, you always were.
Well, it's not so popular anymore.
Hey, how many times have I told you?
Take care of number one.
So, all right, who can you sue?
Nobody.
Nobody admits there's a blacklist.
I mean, they just say,
"Your script's not good enough."
"You're not right for the assignment."
Hey, I know some people.
They're not exactly people...
...but for $50 they'll break a few legs,
and you're not bothered anymore.
- That's not what I need.
- You need money?
I know a stock which is low now,
but it's going up.
I need another name.
Yeah, I can see that.
Rappaport.
- Arnold Rappaport.
- Pseudonyms don't work.
They know we're all changing
our names. I need a real person.
Of course.
Someone they can believe
and I can trust.
- Naturally.
- Now, listen...
...I wouldn't ask you...
- Who would you ask? I'd be insulted.
- Nobody would know, just us.
- When do we start?
Wait a minute. You'd better find out
what you're getting into.
- You put my name on your scripts.
- It's not that simple.
I write the scripts,
send them in your name...
...they buy the scripts, right?
- It's perfect.
- They'll wanna meet the writer.
- So?
You're gonna have to go
and be the writer.
So I'll be the writer.
What's the big deal?
I can do it, and I wanna do it.
I'm your friend. You're in trouble.
What's a friend for?
These days you can get
in trouble being friends.
Life is risk.
- I'm gonna pay you for this, Howard.
- What do you mean "pay"?
A friend takes money?
Ten percent from each script
and no arguments.
You can use the money,
you're always in hock...
...and I'd be paying
an agent that anyway.
- Ten percent?
- Off the top.
- How much do you get for a script?
- $ 750, $ 1000. It depends on the show.
Go home and write.
Your troubles are over.
What are you pulling here?
You owe me for three winters already.
I'm not charity.
Don't get excited.
Your money's coming.
You book bets, you lose,
you pay off.
What, you don't trust me?
You know...
Don't get me mad on you, you hear?
We've been doing business a long
time, so don't get me mad on you.
I don't understand you.
Do you flush your salary
down the toilet?
No, I had a tip on a stock.
It looked good, so I plunged.
Why don't you ask me?
I'm familiar with the market.
Ask me before you flush
your salary down the toilet.
- All right, next time I'll ask you.
- Howard, what's it gonna be with you?
Mama and Papa would turn
in their graves.
I haven't found myself yet, you know,
but it's all gonna change, Myer.
You were always the smart one.
Did I get the lessons?
You could've gone to college.
Instead you're a bum.
How much this time?
- Six hundred.
- You said on the phone four.
Yeah, I know. Four gets me even,
then I'm blank.
- I'm keeping strict accounts.
- You said four, you get four.
Enough is enough.
I'm at the end of my rope, Howard.
I got a business.
You know what it costs now
to feed one lousy mink?
- You know what a cutter gets?
- Thanks...
If you were realizing your potential,
I'd say, "Fine, that's an investment."
- I'm working on it, Myer.
- At that cockamamie job you got?
You call that a job,
with your head?
- I think you're gonna be surprised.
- I'm serious.
The well is running dry.
Sink or swim.
- $500. The winner, number three,
Mr. Turf, ridden by William Boland...
- 3- 60 and 2-90. The place horse,
number six, Stepchild...
The show horse, number 10,
Easy Whirl...
- Belmont Park are a service
of WTRM. Each race...
Loews Sheraton.
Well, who wants him?
Who? Florence Barrett?
What do you look like?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
This is... That's right.
This is Howard Prince, the writer.
No kidding, did you?
Yeah, you liked it?
Sure. No, I can meet...
Afternoons are fine.
You know, I use the evenings to write
because there's less noise.
Okay, great.
Tuesday's perfect.
Right. Ciao.
Yes, Old Gold...
... the cigarette with nearly 200 years
of tobacco know-how...
Florence Barrett.
The one with the hair.
I won't tell him, Phil.
You're the producer.
Do your own dirty work.
- All Hecky has to do is talk to the man.
- Why should he?
Who is this creep anyway?
Just because he works for the FBI?
Where does he come off
clearing anyone?
- It's for Hecky's own good.
- I'm against it.
- I'm against it too.
- Then do something.
I don't run the network.
Can I help you?
- I'm Howard Prince.
- Who?
You're Howard Prince.
I'm Florence Barrett.
I'm glad you could come.
This is Howard Prince, the writer.
Phil Sussman, our producer.
- How do you do?
- Sorry, I didn't connect the name.
That's a hell of a script.
Where've you been hiding?
We looked you up.
No credits, just out of the blue.
Well, I just took up writing
a short while ago.
Well, that's one hell of a script.
You got more?
Are you kidding?
Howard Prince.
This is Steve Parks,
the lead in the show.
- Marvelous script.
- Thank you.
- Hecky Brown.
- Who plays with himself.
- Who plays the narrator.
- Howie! Howie Prince!
They let you out, finally.
Darling, darling, darling.
I've waited for you.
I was faithful to you.
It's been so long.
- You know each other?
- Never saw this man before in my life.
Seriously, Mr. Prince,
a first-class script.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We don't have much time. That's why
I asked you to come right away.
- We wanted to meet you...
- Your script's a little long.
- Four and a half minutes.
- I suggest cutting the kitchen scene.
- I don't know how...
- I think it's a mistake.
To me, the awkward scene
is the one in the police station.
Don't you think?
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.
You know...
...it depends on your definition
of awkward.
The police station has violence.
I'm not saying eliminate it.
I just think it can be trimmed.
What do you think, Mr. Prince?
What?
Yeah.
"Yeah" what?
You know, I think that...
I think that what...
There's a lot of facets here...
...and I don't wanna just answer
right off the top of my head...
...because I don't think it would be
fair to you or fair to the show.
Howard, I know it's not fun to cut your
script, but television is television.
You decide and you cut.
I don't disembowel a writer's script.
I believe in the written word.
- Absolutely.
- I need it tomorrow morning.
But you be happy with it.
- I really liked your script a lot.
- Oh, yeah? Thank you very much.
Most of the stuff I read...
I mean yours had substance.
It was about people.
Well, I feel if you're gonna write
about human beings...
...that you may as well
make them people.
Freedom Information Service.
Freedom Information Service.
Who's calling?
One moment, please.
Mr. Hampton from the network.
Hennessy.
Yes, Tom.
Yes, of course.
First name: Howard.
You got an address on him?
Social Security number?
I'll check him right out.
No, it's no trouble at all, Tom.
That's what you're paying me for.
Yes, he's right here right now.
I'm sure we'll work something out.
I'll get back to you as soon
as I know anything about Prince.
You too, Tom.
Carry on.
- Sorry, Mr. Brown.
- Hecky.
Everybody calls me Hecky.
I'm a household name.
I can't guarantee anything, but if you
tell the truth, I might be able to help.
I'll tell you the truth.
I'll do anything.
The question is, Mr. Brown,
what have you done?
Nothing. I'm an actor.
Nothing?
Six years ago,
I marched in the May Day Parade.
I bought a Daily Worker subscription.
But I never read it, not one word.
Right from the mailbox
to the garbage can.
I was only trying to get laid.
This communist girl,
she had a big ass...
I am not interested
in your sex life, Mr. Brown.
Hecky. I was just telling you
that girl was the reason.
Was she also the reason you signed
a petition for Loyalist Spain?
- Did I do that?
- And Russian war relief.
We were on the same side,
weren't we?
That girl with the big ass,
she was the reason. Honest.
Would you say then
that you were duped?
Tell me what it means,
and I'll say it.
You want it in writing?
Tell me.
- It has to come from you, Mr. Brown.
- Hecky.
From your heart.
It has no value, otherwise.
It'll come. Don't worry.
I'm an actor.
What do I know about politics?
My whole life has been acting.
People from all over the country
write me letters.
Write me a letter, Mr. Brown.
In your own words.
How you were duped,
how you feel about it.
I'm against it 100 percent.
Whoever else you remember
in that parade.
Who asked you to sign
those petitions.
- It was such a long time ago.
- Try to remember.
Sincerity is the key, Mr. Brown.
Anyone can make a mistake.
The man who repents sincerely...
- I repent sincerely.
- Write me the letter, Mr. Brown.
I'll see what I can do.
And I didn't even get laid.
Stand by, everybody.
We have 30 seconds to air.
Can I see opening shots, please?
Camera one.
Can I see opening shots, please?
Camera one.
Fine. Two's good.
Three, frame up, please. Tilt up.
That's it. It looks good.
Watch the boom.
All right, stand by to dim the lights.
And, okay, dim them down.
Looks nice.
Ten...
...nine, eight...
...seven, six...
...five, four, three, two, one.
And fade up on three.
This is my station,
Grand Central...
... where a million stories
start and finish.
And Hecky the Hackie
knows them all.
Tonight, have I got a story for you.
Remember last week you laughed
a lot? Tonight you may cry a little.
See for yourself on Grand Central.
Me?
I'll go make up with my cab.
See you later.
Joey.
Joey?
Pa.
Pa, it's only $4000.
Why, it's almost nothing.
I can pay you back
in a couple of years.
Looks nice.
And ready to one.
Right and tight close-up.
Stand by to go to black.
Thirty seconds to credit.
Studio 12.
Yes.
Thank you. I thought so too.
It was terrific. Thank you.
- Who was it?
- Studio 12.
God.
Hello.
Well, thank you.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes, I'll tell everybody.
- Well, I think we got a winner.
- Studio 12.
I usually don't drink wine at lunch.
It makes me sleepy.
Yeah? So why don't you just
take a nap after?
I have to work.
Well, then, I think we should
go out on a Sunday night.
I think it'd be better.
You don't like Sunday.
So, what about Saturday?
What about Friday?
Regular night?
Howard, I really ought to tell you,
I'm involved.
What does that mean?
You married?
No, but involved.
So what? You tell me that
you're one of those...
..."one guy at a time" people?
Yeah, okay.
Here's what I say to you:
We go out, don't bring him along.
Right?
Okay, so what does he do?
What, is he a writer?
- What, a musician? What?
- Stockbroker.
A stockbroker?
Well, that's interesting. You know.
He's very nice.
Yeah, I was not knocking it, you know,
because you do what you can do.
I gotta ask you,
did you see my new script?
Marvelous.
It's even better than the last one.
Well, you should see the next one.
It's very exciting for me to watch
a new talent emerging.
May I ask you a personal question?
Sure, feel free.
Why did you start writing so late?
Well, because in order to write...
Excuse me.
You gotta get experience.
And you gotta live,
and life is experience...
...so I had to, you know,
get that experience.
Well, here in the city? You do
come from here, don't you?
Yeah, but I bummed around a lot.
I was a boxer and a seaman...
...and all that stuff
you gotta be to write.
- What, you don't believe me?
- Well, should I?
No, but I did bum around a lot.
What about you?
Not a lot.
No, I didn't mean it that way,
you know.
- Where are you from?
- Connecticut.
- That's very ritzy.
- It's very proper, anyway.
I was very well-bred.
The kind of family where the biggest
sin was to raise your voice.
Oh, yeah? In my family the biggest
sin was to buy retail.
- Well, do you guys laugh a lot?
- Who?
You know, you and the stockbroker?
Yes.
Thank you.
The character of the girl
in your script...
You write about women so well,
with such understanding.
Hey, this is all à la carte.
So, what about tomorrow night?
I'd have to tell him.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
Come on. So you go out with me once,
and then you'll know better.
What?
What are you laughing at?
You're so unexpected.
Well, I didn't expect you either.
You call yourself a writer?
Modern American writing started
with Huckleberry Finn.
- It did?
- Hemingway said that.
How about Hemingway?
You're low on moderns.
- Faulkner, Anderson, Fitzgerald.
- All right...
...give me two Hemingways
and a Faulkner.
Faulkner. Hemingway...
There we are.
The Russians. Brothers Karamazov.
- No more Dostoyevsky?
- What else you got?
- Diary of a Writer.
- Oh, yeah? I can use that.
Remember, Howard,
you gotta pay for these.
- No credit.
- Don't worry.
Listen, Danny, I got hit
very hard last week.
Long shots come in like relatives.
Well, soon.
Soon is soon.
Tomorrow, the day after.
Danny, what are you mad about?
It's a promise. Trust me.
Come on, Myer.
Jesus, I'm still an unknown.
What am I talking about?
Five thousand, probably.
You're making as much as I am.
That's how much you know.
Where's taxes and agents?
I gotta buy books and paper.
Money goes through you
like Epsom salts.
- You're a sick individual.
- I'll pay you back.
- I just sold another script.
- Don't play me for a sucker, Howard.
A man earns and you still borrows?
First you pay back what you owe.
My dad's in the study.
- You want a drink?
- Me? No, thanks.
- You look tired.
- Yeah, this was a tough one.
Shit, they're all tough.
But it turned out good, I think.
You really work hard,
don't you?
It's a terrible thing, that blacklist.
You having to work like this.
I always work like this.
To work.
I was thinking, there must be a lot
of writers who are blacklisted.
- So how do they get along?
- Why?
I don't know.
You know, it must be hard.
Yeah, it's hard.
You know, it's funny.
I got them so snowed.
I mean, two writers wouldn't be
any harder than one.
Oh, yeah? You think not?
What do you have to know?
It's a cinch.
Why not three?
- Yeah, even three.
- Ten percent each.
Well, I don't know.
I could do three for 25.
- I wouldn't want you to feel cheated.
- All right, make it 10 percent each.
- You don't think that's fair?
- Oh, no, I think it's a bargain.
Hey, I got the time.
You know writers who need help.
- I'm willing to help.
- Oh, cut the crap, Howard.
I'm running around every place.
I gotta take taxis.
- I gotta keep up appearances.
- You want money.
I'm offering a deal.
Are you some kind of romantic?
That's the trouble with leftos.
You got a thing about money.
- You want the deal or not?
- I do, but I know you.
You'll take off
and fly up your own ass.
I'm willing to help.
Take advantage.
- All I can say, Howard, is thanks.
- Yeah, it's no trouble.
I'm a communist.
I want you to know that right off.
The committee asked me.
I took the Fifth.
- But I'm telling you.
- It's none of my business.
You should know who
you're fronting for.
I don't have to know.
They're trying to sell the cold war.
They use the blacklist
on those who won't buy.
Herb, he doesn't need a lecture.
- I'll send you pamphlets.
- I'll break your arm. Leave him alone.
- He knows who he's mixed up with.
- Who's mixed up?
We're not blacklisted because
we're kind to dumb animals.
Or because somebody lied
about us or made a mistake.
I know, you're out of work.
That's all I have to know.
What about taxes?
That's gonna be a problem.
You need a deductible?
Take my advice: Natural gas.
- Yeah, I heard cattle.
- Cattle is also good.
Filet of sole.
Vegetable cutlet.
Mushroom omelet.
Protose steak.
Eat in good health.
All right, the network pays him, he
pays us. Less the 10 percent, right?
Then we just pay all the taxes
that we owe.
Nothing illegal.
No tricks.
Everybody declares exactly
what he earned.
What's he paying us for?
Gotta put something down.
We're his collaborators.
Anyone reads the returns
connects him with us.
Can't we protect him better?
The IRS isn't gonna care as long
as the right tax is paid.
The FBI will. And they've been
looking at tax returns.
Only in political cases.
He's not political.
You guys kill me.
They're beating your brains out,
and you're worried about taxes?
We're worried about you.
Don't worry about me, okay?
Just write the script.
I'll take care of my end.
Five pounds, sweetheart.
Have a nice day.
Cash.
Three hundred?
Howard, have an orange.
- Thanks, Uncle Howard.
- Thank you, Uncle Howard.
Thank you, Howard.
I'm Harry Stone, the actor.
Harry Stone, the director,
is who you want.
- I'm blacklisted. They think I'm him.
- I understand.
I never joined anything.
It's a terrible mistake.
I can only help people
who are willing...
...to clear up what they've done.
- But I haven't done anything.
- That's why I can't help you.
- Mr. Hampton from the network.
- Thank you.
Yes, Tom.
Yes, I've got a report
on Howard Prince.
No, no proof he's a member
of the party.
Of course, no proof that he isn't.
I suggest I keep investigating.
Well, no, I don't have to.
I can send you a bill
and forget it.
You're the one who has to answer
to the American people.
Exactly.
That's all I'm saying.
You can't be too careful these days.
No, I don't suppose anyone can
object if you keep using him.
Nothing to object to...
... so far.
Thank you.
- You can use him.
- Thank God.
He's the best writer I've got.
Hell, he's the only writer I've got.
I don't know how he does it.
What about Hecky Brown?
He wrote the letter.
It wasn't good enough.
It's not my decision, Phil.
They tell me, I tell you.
What do I tell Hecky?
You decided he's not right
for the part.
You've changed the character.
You've fired actors before.
Tell him what you told them.
He'll know it's not true.
Can he prove it?
- I should get back to the office.
- What's the rush?
You're having a script conference.
That takes time.
Then we ought to talk
about the script.
Later. Come on.
Hey, what's the matter?
You're the only writer I know who
never wants to talk about his work.
- I'm superstitious.
- No, you're not.
Yeah, I am. The way I see it,
you're either a writer or a talker.
You're genuinely modest.
I admire that.
Well...
Well, do you like sports?
- I'm embarrassing you.
- No. Do you...? I'm serious.
What do you think of sports?
I like swimming.
No, swimming's not a sport.
You swim so you don't drown.
You know, sport is what
you play with a ball.
I used to play basketball in school.
You play basketball?
Yeah? You'd be interested maybe
in playing one-on-one sometime?
Or, you know, if you
ever wanna lay a bet, I'm...
Jesus, forget that.
Hey...
...you know, I'm...
You know, I'm not just a writer.
I mean, l...
I want you to...
- I want you to know...
- I know.
You know?
How I feel about you.
That's what you know?
I don't have to know anything more.
It's first-class.
You know, I've never seen
an account like yours.
Up and down, up and down. One
week a big deposit, the next week...
If you don't mind my asking,
what does a man like you do?
Futures.
Mr. Delaney.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
We'd like to talk to you.
- I've got nothing to say to you.
- Thought you'd be ready to cooperate.
Nobody has to know.
See you again, Mr. Delaney.
Keep walking.
You're here!
He's here!
We've been trying all over.
- Thank God.
- What's the matter?
- I said I'd bring it to you today.
- Forget that one.
- What do you mean, forget it?
- I said, forget it.
- Rewrite the old one.
- What old one?
The one with flashbacks
to the concentration camp.
- You said it was great.
- Beautiful.
- Florence said she cried.
- An award-winning show.
- I cried at the gas chamber scenes.
- Then?
The sponsor won't approve it.
- You found him.
- First, they said yes. Now it's no.
You want to know why?
It's unbelievable.
They're a gas company. They decided
the show makes gas look bad.
We can make it a firing squad.
They killed Jews that way too.
- Leave it to Howard.
- What is the excitement?
They want changes, make it
a firing squad. It's a good idea.
- Write new scenes.
- I'll go home...
- You don't have time to go home.
- I'll take a cab.
You don't realize,
time is of the essence!
Look at us. We're stuck here! They're
waiting upstairs for the rewrite.
The network, the sponsor.
They don't approve, there is no show!
- They can't wait till tonight?
- They want it now.
- I must keep you here until it's done.
- No. I can't write except in my room.
We got a good office.
You will not be disturbed.
- No, I don't get inspired.
- It doesn't have to be inspiring.
There isn't much writing. We have
to be careful not to lose the emotion.
Don't bother him with details.
He's got a lot of work to do.
Come on in.
Now, clear your mind and write.
Quiet, children. Quiet.
Boys and girls, we have a very special
visitor to our assembly today.
Not long ago, he sat in the same seats
you're sitting in now.
But because he worked hard...
...and studied hard...
...he is now
a famous television writer.
Hecky...
...I don't know how to say this,
but I'm worried.
I'm not the only one, upstairs too.
Worried about what?
- Here, Sussman, take a pickle.
- No, no.
- The show is a smash.
- Yeah, well so far.
So far, so good.
I gotta look ahead, Hecky.
Your quality, I don't know,
the character's not working.
I made up the character.
You loved it.
First impression was tremendous.
Don't get me wrong.
- You think so too?
- It's not her decision.
- What decision?
- I think you're wonderful, Hecky.
So does everyone else.
No one denies your talent. It's...
Your personality is too dominant.
You belong out front,
like Berle, in one.
In a dramatic series, you're
throwing the show off balance.
- Who says?
- A talent like yours needs room.
You know what you need? A show
of your own, where you can dominate.
As a matter of fact,
I got a few ideas.
We'll make some time,
get together and kick them around.
- Is it the letter?
- Absolutely not.
- I wrote what that snake asked me to.
- Wouldn't I tell you?
The problem is artistic.
Female of the species.
No, I think you have to safely say
that Grand Central...
No, I think you have to safely say
that Grand Central...
... is one of the few television shows
where the writer is really the star.
Yeah, but you know,
there's a lot of other people too.
- I mean wonderful people.
- I certainly understand...
... the importance of actors
and then, of course, directors.
Did you write in high school?
Did I write in high school?
Yeah, you had to.
- It was Brooklyn.
- It was formally Brooklyn.
Oh, Hecky!
- You know, went around and l...
- But the television form is so different.
- It's...
- Oh, you know it.
- Yeah. And you're so terrific at it.
- Well, you know, I didn't say it.
I wrote what you asked. I was duped.
I didn't know what I was doing.
I'll never do it again.
What more can I say?
- That's up to you.
- I have to work.
I can't get work, Mr. Hennessy.
The doors are closed in my face.
My own agent, 30 years, he won't
even answer my telephone calls.
I appreciate your situation.
I do, Mr. Brown.
I've helped people in your situation.
Then help me, please.
Tell me. I'll turn myself inside out.
- I'll do anything you tell me.
- You make that difficult to believe.
What else can I do?
I'll do it, believe me. You don't know
what I'm going through.
I'd like to believe you, but I feel
you're not being entirely frank.
Give me a "for instance."
You'll see. I promise.
You marched in a May Day Parade.
Only because of that girl
with the big ass.
Whose name you say
you can't remember.
What was her name?
Tessie? Bessie?
I wasn't interested in her name.
I was interested in her body.
Other people
marched in that parade...
...other actors, directors.
You don't remember
their names either?
- I'm terrible with names.
- They remember you.
I'm a well-known personality.
You talked with these people?
Some of them were kind enough
to write letters.
Then you know who they are.
So it's not so important I remember.
- You know already.
- Your sincerity is important.
- Your desire to cooperate fully.
- I told you what I did!
I apologized!
I come to you on my hands and knees,
Mr. Hennessy. Please.
All I wanna do is work.
That's all I care about. I have a wife.
Two growing boys.
Children. Look.
Here. Here.
Plus a wife from before.
If the alimony doesn't come...
I sold my car last week for peanuts!
A brand-new model!
All the money I made, I ask myself,
where did it go so fast?
I can't pay the rent, Mr. Hennessy.
Nothing can go out
if it doesn't come in.
Do you know Howard Prince?
I was on the show.
A big talent. Big.
Do you know him personally?
Only from the show.
Once in a while,
a bite to eat afterwards.
Think you could get
to know him better?
I'm not good at that sort of thing.
Honestly.
Actors, inside,
you'd be surprised, are very shy.
He knows you already.
You're very likable.
- I'm sure he feels sympathy for you.
- What could I find out?
Who his friends are.
What he does in his spare time.
Where he stands on the issues
of the day.
Can't you ask him that yourself?
If he were part of the communist
conspiracy, could we believe him?
If he isn't?
We'd like you to help us find out.
You want me to spy
on Howard Prince?
We're in a war, Mr. Brown.
Against a ruthless and tricky enemy
who will stop at nothing...
...to destroy our way of life.
To be a spy on the side
of freedom is an honor.
And if I spy on Howard Prince,
I can work?
I don't do the hiring, Mr. Brown.
I only advise about Americanism.
But in my opinion,
as the sign of a true patriot...
...it would certainly help.
I quit.
Quit. Quit. Finished. Resigned. Quit.
Let Sussman do his own dirty work.
I won't be part of it.
No more. Not any more. Finished.
Watching people destroyed. Crucified
like Hecky. I'm going to fight it.
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?
- Howard, this is beautiful.
- You quit your job?
I feel so relieved, you have no idea.
I've been a hypocrite to take
their money and keep my mouth shut.
I still don't understand.
You quit your job?
They count on our silence.
People keeping quiet,
afraid to speak up.
Do you know what I'm gonna do?
Publish a newspaper.
Well, anyway, a pamphlet: Facts
About Blacklists. Do you like the title?
I was on the phone all morning.
People are dying to talk...
...as long as I don't use their names.
Oh, Howard, we'll shake them up.
I'll do the legwork
and you'll do the writing.
Hey, not so fast. Jesus. Florence,
you're making a big mistake.
I believe in personal responsibility,
Howard. If you believe, act.
But I don't understand.
You're throwing away a whole career.
You...
You could...
You're a terrific script editor.
You could be a producer.
You'd be the first woman producer
of a dramatic series.
If I keep my mouth shut.
So? That's not such
a terrible idea sometimes.
- But that's what they're counting on.
- Do me a favor. Please, sit down.
Relax.
You're going off the deep end.
Jesus, let me give you
some champagne.
I'm serious, Howard.
What do you mean you're serious?
You come bursting in here.
You're ready to start a revolution.
For God's sakes, Florence,
what are you trying to do?
I want us to fight them.
Not get bought off.
I'm not mad at anybody.
We live in the world, Howard.
No, you live in the world,
I live right here.
Hey, come on,
what are you trying to do to me?
You know how long
it took me to get here?
I like it here. I like what I'm doing.
For the first time,
I got everything I want.
- I'm not trying to take it away from you.
- No, but that's what's going to happen.
Howard, I'm only talking
about a simple commitment.
I didn't ask you to marry me.
Jesus, you know, we got
such a terrific relationship going.
- So, why do you wanna spoil it?
- Relationship isn't only sex, you know.
- There are more important aspects.
- I know there are.
Like what?
Human rights.
What about my rights? I'm human.
What happened to my rights
all of a sudden?
I live here, it's clean.
Come on, what are you
putting me on the spot for?
You really want success, don't you?
So, what should I want, a disease?
Yes, I want success.
- What's wrong with that?
- More than anything else?
Florence, you're looking
to get me killed here.
I'm a writer. I'm not looking
for any kind of trouble.
- I don't wanna make waves.
- A writer looks for trouble.
No. Wrong.
A lunatic looks for trouble.
Florence, you're crazy.
You're out of your mind.
You already said that.
There's no need in repeating yourself.
I want you to go in
to Sussman tomorrow...
...and tell him
that you made a mistake.
- I should tell him?
- Exactly. Go in and tell him...
...you're sorry and you should get...
- But I'm not sorry.
Florence, I don't think you know
exactly what's good for you.
But I do know
when I've made a mistake.
And I made this
kind of a mistake before...
...confusing the artist with the man.
I just want you to know
I still admire the artist.
- You're going?
- Yes.
I have a club date in the mountains.
I thought you could drive me up.
Sure. You couldn't have called me
at a better time.
When you work as hard as I do,
you need time to relax.
Otherwise it's all work and no play.
I guess you have a lot of friends.
The usual. I like to pick up
a phone, get out, have fun.
But the important thing is that you've
got to get right back to basics.
What do you like to do
in your spare time?
The usual.
The usual.
I used to love the usual,
but my ship has sailed.
Watch your step around here.
The broads, take a look at them...
...and you say to yourself,
"Where's this been all my life?"
They come at you from all directions.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
- Later on you find out you're the fish.
- Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
Don't make any promises.
These broads
come up here with their lawyers.
- Yeah? You play these places much?
- Until I got in TV.
You know what I used
to get for one night?
- What?
- Three grand.
That should come in handy now.
- You know what I'm getting tonight?
- What?
Five hundred.
Five...
That doesn't seem fair.
And where is it written
it should be fair?
Come on, Howie, you must have
some friends in the same position.
Hecky! It's a pleasure.
How long? A year, two years?
- It's a pleasure having you back.
- Likewise.
This is my friend, Howard
Prince, the great and famous writer.
Pleasure, Howard.
Any friend of Hecky's.
Come on, we'll go inside,
have a drink.
- I never drink before a show.
- We'll have a talk.
How's everything?
Oh, it's Hecky Brown!
Would you please park my car for me?
Thank you.
- You staying long?
- Just the weekend.
- You too?
- Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm a writer.
A writer.
- You'll have a drink, Howard?
- Sure.
Here we go.
To a giant
of the entertainment world.
Business looks good, Sam.
- Full up.
- Loss leaders.
We give discounts
so the rooms won't stay empty.
To tell you the truth, we're not
even holding our own. The upkeep.
Which comes to what I want
to mention.
The 500. I already accepted, Sam.
- I don't need your song and dance.
- Two-fifty.
You promised five.
I was hoping five.
I figured I'd steal a little from the band,
from the dance team.
Make it up that way. But you know
the unions, they could shut me down.
- You knew this when you said five.
- I was still hoping.
Last year I played this joint
for how much?
All right, today is not like last year.
But I'm still Hecky Brown.
Don't you forget that.
- You can't get Hecky Brown for 250.
- Maybe 300.
Out of my own pocket.
I piss on your 300!
Who else is offering that much?
Don't be foolish. Face facts.
There's a cloud over your head.
If it was up to me personally,
I'd pay you the moon.
But business is business.
You drove all the way up here.
You wanna go home empty?
Take the 250.
You said 300.
I'll see what I can do.
You were great.
You were really great.
Let's stop this pretense. Room 904.
Isn't he fantastic?
I could watch him every night.
He's so hilarious.
You a guest here?
What do you do?
I'm a dentist.
Professionally?
I'm Sandy.
Herman. Herman Miller.
- You have your own practice?
- Yes, I do.
But I gotta get another guy in with me,
because it's getting too big.
Are you by any chance attached?
Only to my work.
Hecky, Hecky, what can I say.
I'm speechless. Words fail me.
One of the great performances.
You can tell your children...
...your grandchildren you saw one
of the all-time greats, without peer.
- Beautiful!
- Two-fifty.
I did what I could.
But you said 300.
- Maybe next month.
- Out of your own pocket.
By popular demand.
What comes out of your pocket?
Tell me.
Hecky, will you stop?
- Tell me what's inside here.
- Hecky, don't tickle me.
- Hecky, will you stop being so...?
- Appreciation?
- Sympathy?
- Hecky...
What comes out of your pockets?
You know what comes out
of your pockets? Blood!
Blood comes out of your pocket!
- Get him out of here!
- Blood!
- Get this crazy...
- I want to kill you.
You son of a...
Get him out!
Get him out of here! Out! Out!
Get him out! Get him out!
Get him out of here! You fat pig!
You'll never work again!
I'm Hecky Brown! I'm Hecky Brown!
You'll crawl in the gutter, you red
bastard! You commie son of a bitch!
Come on. Give me that.
Hey, here's what I want you to do.
I want you to sleep
on the sofa tonight...
...because you'll find
it's extremely comfortable.
It's brand-new. You're gonna like this.
See? Just stay here.
Window.
Let me make you
some coffee, okay?
It's all Brownstein's fault.
I wouldn't be in this trouble
if it wasn't for Brownstein.
- Yeah, who?
- Brownstein.
Hershel Brownstein?
- Who's Hershel Brownstein?
- You can't make a deal with him.
That's the trouble.
He won't listen to reason.
Is that your real name?
Hershel Brownstein?
Brownstein! Lay off, you hear me?
Lay off or I'll kill you!
Jesus, you know, people
change their names. It's no crime.
What do you know?
Who the hell are you? A newcomer.
- Why don't you sit down?
- Why don't you shut up?
You think you're so special?
Talent is no protection.
- You do as they say or else.
- I'm gonna make you some coffee.
This is a very nice apartment.
Very nice.
- Thank you.
- You have nice things.
Bookcases, hi-fi...
...and nice furniture.
You like this apartment, I bet.
You worked hard for it.
You deserve it.
You'd like to keep this apartment,
right?
You know what we should do?
Call your wife.
Because you should tell her
at least where you are tonight.
Where'd you go last week?
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere is somewhere.
From the heart,
no credit unless it's from the heart.
Here and there.
Around and about.
- What do you want me to say?
- Where'd you go last year?
Year before, who'd you see?
Where did you march?
- What did you sign?
- Nothing.
That girl you're with.
What's her name?
- Florence.
- A troublemaker.
I heard her talking on the set.
Subversive. She's a red.
- You like that girl?
- Yes, I like her.
- Her name?
- I told you.
- Her full name.
- Florence Barrett.
- You know she's a red?
- Stop it, Hecky! I don't like this game.
Actually, I think you could say
that modern American fiction...
...began with Huckleberry Finn.
- But what about Melville?
Especially today, the sense of evil.
Oh, yeah.
How could you leave out Melville?
You must be so excited. The show
going from a half-hour to an hour.
I was expecting it
with those ratings.
They're no fools up there.
Can you get the same quality
in an hour?
It is a problem,
no doubt about it.
It's like going from
a short story to a novel.
But one thing I've learned:
You got the talent,
you got the quality.
Phil. Howard.
I want you to meet Hubert Jackson.
Jackson Supermarkets,
out on the island.
- Congratulations, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
- Hubert's a great fan of your show.
- Never miss it.
But he's a little concerned
about some of the actors.
We go for the best, Mr. Jackson.
In my opinion, some of them
are pretty pink, Mr. Sussman.
That's just the makeup.
I told Hubert we are
as concerned as he is.
Not that they are, the actors.
We take every precaution.
- The slightest hint.
- I know my customers.
If they think a company is sponsoring
reds, they don't buy their product.
- How do they know?
- I tell them.
Put a sign right up over the product.
Yes, I thought you might send Hubert
a list of the actors you plan to use.
Let him look them over,
give you any ideas.
Absolutely.
You'll get full cooperation
from us, Hubert.
Nothing to worry about.
Thanks, boys.
How many stores that guy got?
Three, maybe four.
He's got three stores,
he tells a whole network who to hire?
Who wants trouble?
Nice to see you again, Mr. Prince.
- Here's your check, Herb.
- Thanks.
Here you go, Bill.
- And yours didn't come yet, Allie.
- What?
You were late with the script.
You gotta watch that.
Oh, by the way,
here's your script back.
It needs rewrite, I'm afraid.
- What didn't Sussman like?
- I didn't show it to him.
What do you mean
you didn't show it?
It wasn't ready.
Come on, Allie,
I can't hand in anything.
My name's going on that script.
I got a reputation.
I'll try to write up
to your standards, Howard.
It's possible going to an hour
is too much pressure for you guys.
Because I've been noticing
the stuff lately and it's thin, fellas.
The keyword, I think, is "substance."
I've been reading
the Eugene O'Neill plays...
...and I would like, if possible,
something along those lines.
- More laughs.
- Exactly. You know, but gutsy.
Incidentally, I think I made a deal
for a new series.
We've got our hands full here.
So you put on a couple of
more writers. I need a pilot script.
How about Eugene O'Neill?
- He's dead, Herb.
- What's the subject?
It's a woman reporter,
which, I think, is a great idea.
I got the perfect actress.
- Her and a Howard Prince script.
- We'll look around.
Right. But good, Bill,
because blacklisted is not enough.
Scrambled eggs, loose.
White fish.
Let's see, eggplant steak.
Eat in good health.
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill him. You rat.
Al, take it easy, please.
Look, this is ridiculous.
I've been calling you now
for three weeks...
...and you don't answer me.
Nothing.
What's the big deal?
We had a little argument.
We don't think alike, Howard.
We don't believe in the same things.
Do you think I like the blacklist?
I hate the blacklist.
- Did I send money for your pamphlet?
- Giving money is easy.
Well, what's easy for you is not
always easy for everybody else.
You see trouble and right away
you run and get a gun.
Or a pamphlet or some...
I'm just looking all the time
not to get killed, that's all.
Is that such a big difference?
We have to break up over that?
Yeah, maybe we do.
So you want to stay broken up?
You think I want to make you
lose everything.
You think I'm intolerant
and demanding, and maybe I am.
But that's me.
Well, then, I need more time.
Because I've never met anybody
like you, you know?
I tried to get us tickets to the Paul
Robeson concert, you know...
...but it happened to be on the same
night as the basketball game, so...
- We'll go to the game, right?
- I have tickets for the concert.
All right, so here's what:
I'll give up my tickets,
you give up yours...
...and we'll go to the dinner.
Right?
- Florence, I miss you.
- I miss you too.
So we'll have a date.
A subpoena?
For me?
To appear before
the House Un-American Committee.
Well, what do you mean? When?
How do you know?
They found out upstairs.
It will be issued any minute now.
- But I'm not a communist.
- So you go and tell them that.
- I tell you, isn't that enough?
- You've got to go.
I don't like it anymore than you do,
but if you don't do it, you don't work.
Why don't they all just go away
and let us do the show?
Who needs this?
You know, Phil...
...I didn't believe Florence
when she told me that about you.
That crazy broad.
You know, because I know it was
very tough for you to fire Hecky.
I had a migraine for a week.
Phil, it just takes one guy
to say no to them. Just one.
- What can I do, Howie?
- You can be that guy.
No, I'm serious.
If just one person says no...
...especially a guy like you. You're
respected. You got a big name.
Tell them no.
Who the hell are they?
Come on, Phil, take a stand.
The real you.
Get me Hampton.
Hello, Tom? There is no reason
Howard has to go to that committee.
It's our network.
Who the hell are they
telling us what to do?
No, you listen to me.
He doesn't have to go.
What are we, sheep?
We make a stand.
We tell them to lay off his back,
to stop threatening...
...or they're in trouble.
We show them there are
some people they can't scare.
We tell them flat out,
"Howard Prince doesn't go."
Right.
Right.
Okay.
You gotta go.
You gotta go.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Nothing to worry about at all.
We've dealt with
the committee before...
...and they're really
very understanding.
They understand our problems
and we understand theirs.
And what about my problems?
You're cooperating.
That's all they care about.
- This friend of yours, Alfred Miller.
- We went to school together.
And you had no idea
that he was a communist?
- He was only 12.
- You have no idea now?
- We never talk about politics.
- Good.
Let's see, now. The two men,
Delaney and Phelps?
- They're friends of Allie's.
- All right.
- And the girl, Florence Barrett?
- That's just sex.
Is that why you gave money
to her pro-communist publication?
We were going out.
She wanted to start a magazine.
How was I to know what kind?
- That's hardly credible, Mr. Prince.
- Mr. Hennessy...
...you and your staff
have done a splendid job.
The network appreciates your efforts...
...but Mr. Prince is being
entirely cooperative.
I think that I can handle the legal end.
Thank you very much for coming.
Good luck, Mr. Prince.
Howard, don't mind him.
- He's only doing his job.
- I still don't see why we can't fix it.
Like pay somebody off,
because how much could it cost?
- They're just congressmen.
- It won't be necessary.
They've agreed
to an executive session.
No reporters, no publicity.
As a matter of fact, you won't
even have to go to Washington.
They'll send a subcommittee here.
We'll write you a strong
anti-communist statement...
... to go along with your testimony.
You will be out of there in no time.
Howard, all they want
is a friendly witness.
Okay.
So I'll be a friendly witness.
Hi, Howard.
Hi, Howard.
Hey, very nice.
You gotta lay off health foods.
Jesus, when are they gonna operate,
get rid of that ulcer already?
Then how am I going
to know when I'm mad?
Nobody knows how
to relax anymore, right?
- You gotta roll with the punches.
- What about the subpoena?
Nothing. Don't worry about a thing.
- Did they write a statement for you?
- Yeah.
I'd let you read it,
only you'd start bleeding again.
Don't worry about it, really.
Just take care of yourself.
Worry about
who's gonna write scripts.
We got a very good writer.
You won't be ashamed.
- Blacklisted?
- Impeccably.
- Named by his own brother-in-law.
- Visiting hours are over.
Nurse, I'm Dr. Prince.
This is a consultation.
These are my associates.
Why do you think
they want you to testify?
I'm a feather in their cap.
I'm a big writer, Howard Prince.
They've already got our names. Why
do they need you to tell them again?
So it makes them look good.
So what?
They don't care about names. It's
about getting people to give names...
...to show there's nothing
they can't get people to do.
If I don't cooperate, you don't work,
nobody works. Is that what you want?
We're laying too much on him.
Why should he take the rap?
Because I want him to know
what he's doing.
- I'm helping.
- You're helping them.
No, I'm using them.
I'm smarter than they are.
Howard, the time
for this bullshit is over.
If I'm friendly,
where is the personal crime?
I tell them you're my friend
from school.
They already got your name.
You said that yourself.
He's right.
They can't do anything more to us.
- Why can't he just cooperate?
- Tell them the truth?
He won't have to.
The networks made a deal:
Say the committee's great,
they leave him alone.
And everybody gets what he wants.
That's what this is about, right?
Stop worrying.
They want publicity.
They want Howard Prince...
...as an example to scare people.
Shut them up.
- He should take the Fifth.
- They'll blacklist him.
What's the Fifth?
The Fifth Amendment.
Your right not to incriminate yourself.
Why do I have to? It's all fixed.
They might ask you questions
you don't want to answer.
But if you already answered one,
you don't have that right anymore.
Then if you don't answer,
they cite you for contempt.
Yeah, but I'm gonna answer.
Schmuck.
Maybe he should.
What can he tell them?
I don't trust the committee
or the network.
- Take the Fifth.
- I don't want to.
- You can't cooperate!
- Don't be a loser all your life.
You quit looking for an out!
Look, do not aggravate yourself.
You want that milk, now. Here.
You did a big favor for all of us.
I don't have to tell you that.
- Who's asking?
- You saved our ass.
- You did what a friend does.
- Exactly.
- Lf I cooperate, you're saved again.
- But you can't be on their side.
So, what do I do?
I tell the committee to shove it, right?
- You don't work, nobody works.
- Let me worry about that.
What about me? What do I do,
go back to the cash register?
You're laying here...
...you can't use your name,
you're bleeding...
...and you're telling me what to do?
Al, can we ask him to do
what he doesn't believe in?
Protect yourself.
Take the Fifth.
You're always looking for a middle
you can dance around in.
Well, this time there isn't any middle.
And you can't lay any of it off on us.
Whatever you do, you do for yourself.
Open up in the name of the law!
Get out your guns, men.
Nobody move. This is a raid.
Everybody. Everybody out.
You have a girl in your room.
If not, why not?
You got a little tootsie for me?
Have we met before?
You know you scared me?
I was in the neighborhood
and suddenly everything went black.
- Am I disturbing you?
- Are you kidding?
You really want to know, I came
to apologize for that terrible night.
- I wasn't myself.
- You had every right.
Two rights don't make a wrong.
- I gave you a hard time and I'm sorry.
- Silly. Have a drink.
Before the sun is over the yardarm?
Never. A wee touch of scotch.
- How's it going?
- Not bad.
Club dates.
Out of town, but not bad.
Scranton, Allentown, Altoona.
You didn't know
I was a big hit in Pennsylvania.
But my wife found a job, the kids eat,
we all have our health.
To a prince of a prince.
You know, I never learned
how to sip a drink.
When I was very little,
every evening before supper...
...my father would pour a shot glass
full of whiskey, mumble a prayer:
And down it went.
I thought that was the way you drank.
How are things going with you?
- Fine.
- I hear terrific.
It's nice when nice happens
to somebody nice.
Doesn't happen too often.
Are you sure
I'm not being a nuisance?
Of course not.
Did you know Johnny Parker,
the actor?
No.
Blacklisted.
He couldn't get arrested.
Wife, three kids, you can imagine.
He drove a cab for a while.
Finally gave that up.
He came from out West. Oklahoma,
Texas, someplace like that.
He owned a little farm
that his father left him.
Miserable. He showed me pictures.
You'd go crazy in a place like that.
But he could grow his own food,
so he went back.
We had a party for him.
Everybody cried.
Six months later, right in the middle
of that miserable property...
...they struck oil!
- You're kidding?
- Honest to God! Oil!
He's a millionaire!
So you see...
Every little cloud
Has got a silver lining
- Let me make you another drink.
- No, no, not really.
I came, I apologized.
It's time to go.
What we should do
is have dinner sometime.
- I'd like that very much.
- Yeah?
- Well, what about tonight?
- Tonight? No, no, I'm busy.
So, all right, so why don't...?
I'll call you.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
If I had a buck for every time they
said that to me when I first started...
Of course, I don't have to tell you, later
on, the shoe was on the other foot.
- I really will call.
- I know you will. I was making a joke.
- You don't mind I didn't phone?
- Come on, you kidding?
Well, some people mind.
You're a good man.
You know what I think I'll do?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Take care of yourself.
The water is full of sharks.
Thank you, sir.
Where have you been?
I was so worried about you.
I called and there's no answer.
You know, I was just walking around.
Are you all right?
You know, I've been thinking
about a lot of stuff.
Well, I saved you your dinner.
I kept it warm for you.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, but just a drink.
I saw you at the funeral today.
You did? I didn't see you.
Well, I couldn't handle it.
I couldn't handle it either.
You're lucky you're a writer
and not an actor.
At least with writers, if he gets
blacklisted, he can always still write.
An actor, what's he going to do
if he can't show his face?
How would you feel
if I was not a writer?
Howard, I know you.
Whatever else you might have to do
to survive, you'll find time to write.
Well, suppose I said
that I was not a writer.
I know you as a writer.
I love you.
Well...
...l'm not a writer.
- Don't be a defeatist.
Other guys wrote those scripts,
not me.
I put my name on them.
They were blacklisted.
I was helping them out.
It's my name and their scripts.
That's a very bizarre statement.
I'm not a writer, Florence.
I'm a front.
I front for blacklisted writers.
- You're not a writer?
- No.
I couldn't write a grocery list.
- You never wrote any of those scripts?
- Nothing. Not one.
- I'm practically illiterate.
- You never wrote anything?
Hey, Jesus, don't get shell-shocked.
I'm not confessing to a murder.
Look at you, you're all white.
- Let me get you a drink.
- I don't want a drink.
You should put your head
between your legs.
- You let me think that you were...
- Well, why not?
What did you want me to do?
For God's sake, I was like a spy.
Did you want to?
Did I want to? Of course I wanted to.
You think I liked lying to you?
Come on, Florence, you know
that lying is not in my nature.
I don't believe this is happening.
Hey, I have to testify.
Will you keep your mind on that?
But it's like you're
a complete stranger.
- So we got off on the wrong foot.
- The wrong foot?
I was sworn to secrecy.
We're both on the same side.
- Didn't you trust me?
- I wasn't allowed.
- Did you think I would lose interest?
- You never were.
- You were in love with a writer.
- I don't even know you.
I shouldn't have said anything.
You're hysterical.
Nobody is hysterical.
Were you gonna mention it
when we were 90?
- I mentioned it now.
- Because you're in trouble.
Yes, I'm in trouble.
For a good reason.
Who was I spying for, Hitler?
I was helping blacklisted writers.
You lied to me.
What are you really, a druggist?
You want to know what I was?
I ran a cash register.
You were a cashier?
That's exactly what I mean, see?
Unless it's a writer or an artist,
catch you in bed with a cashier...
- That's not fair.
- You wouldn't have looked twice.
It is not what someone does,
it is who he is.
- And you don't even know who I am.
- Did you ever give me the chance?
I'm giving you right now.
All right.
Who are you?
- What?
- I still don't know who you are.
I only know who you're not.
Who is Howard Prince?
Hey, Florence, I got to tell you,
it's not easy being in love with you.
What you're looking for all the time
is a knight on a horse or something.
Which is not Howard Prince.
You know who Howard Prince is?
- Howard Prince is his own man.
- What does that mean?
You'll find out when I come back
from the committee tomorrow.
What am I going to find?
You said it was all fixed.
I've been thinking.
Everybody's telling me what to do...
...but I don't see why I have to.
- What are you going to do?
- I'll work something out.
Are you gonna tell them
you're not a writer?
I'll tell them exactly what I want to.
That committee is dangerous. They're
out for blood. You can't fool around.
All those people, Allie and Sussman,
everything...
...they're wrong,
because I can beat that committee...
...and I can beat them my own way.
- How?
What's the difference?
I'm not going to wind up back at that
cash register. Take my word for it.
And I'm not going to do anything
that makes you ashamed of me.
Trust me. Can you trust me?
And we would like to thank
this committee...
And we would like to thank
this committee...
...for allowing Mr. Prince to appear
and voice his approval...
...of the great work
that you're doing for our country.
Communist subversion
is a real and present danger...
...and you can rest assured
that it will never be tolerated...
...on the network that both Mr. Prince
and I have the honor to represent.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
This committee is here
to help keep America...
...just as pure
as we possibly can make it.
Well, I can't think of anything
more important.
I'd like to commend
this committee...
...on the job that they're doing.
- Thank you.
Counsel.
Just a few questions.
We know you're a busy man.
Mr. Prince, do you happen
to know an Alfred Miller?
Who?
Alfred Miller.
Why?
If you'd just tell the committee.
So I can't know why?
Mr. Prince, you don't have to worry.
Anyone that comes here and tells the
truth has got nothing to worry about.
- Which Alfred Miller?
- Do you know Alfred Miller, the writer?
When you say "know," can you
ever really know a person?
I grew up with an Alfred Miller,
but do I know him?
Would you say I know him?
Can you know...?
In a biblical sense, know him?
Am I right?
Would that be the same Alfred Miller
you met with several times...
...in Hammer's Dairy Restaurant?
- Who says I did?
- Is it or is it not true?
- No, I asked you first.
- Is it true?
Is anybody accusing me of anything?
- Answer the question.
- Which question?
You asked one question,
I answered that question and then...
- Do you know Alfred Miller?
- You already asked that question.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
I'm handling it.
If you don't answer,
they can hold you for contempt.
I am answering.
I'm just not replying, that's all.
Don't split hairs.
They can only get me if I don't answer.
If I answer without replying, I got them.
- But you're getting them mad.
- What can they do, throw me out?
Do you know Alfred Miller?
Are you guys aware that every week...
...busloads of communists
are coming in over the border?
Is anybody doing anything
about that?
We are not concerned
at this time with anything...
...other than the communist
conspiracy in entertainment.
Why aren't we doing something
about it?
Why isn't everybody armed?
Everybody should learn to use a gun.
It's a mistake anyone who goes
to military school is only...
You send them there
when they're bad.
Mr. Prince, this committee
is just as concerned...
...about the threat of communism
as you are.
Since your memory
is unclear about Alfred Miller...
...do you know any of these
other people:
William Phelps...
...Herbert Delaney...
...Florence Barrett...
...Hershel Brownstein...
...also known as Hecky Brown?
- He's dead.
- Did you know him?
Mr. Prince...
...now you came here
to cooperate today, did you not?
Will you excuse us a moment,
Mr. Prince?
John.
I thought we had an arrangement.
With the network.
He's doing this by himself.
- Hit him with contempt.
- He's not giving us any grounds.
We can't let him get away with this.
Now, there's got to be something
that you can just nail him on.
Okay.
Mr. Prince, let me ask you
another question.
Do you know a Patrick Callahan?
Who?
Bartender at the Friendly Tavern...
...where, I believe, you once worked
as a night cashier.
I did?
Do you know Daniel LaGattuta?
Doesn't he sell fruit?
You placed bets for Mr. Callahan
and Mr. LaGattuta, did you not?
In a strictly friendly way.
I remind you that placing bets
is a crime.
Howard, is this true?
You were a bookmaker?
- Not professionally.
- Oh, my God.
Mr. Chairman, may I have
a word with you, please?
They're willing to make a deal.
- Give them names, right?
- They're being very reasonable.
You don't have to give them
more than one.
- Yeah, which one?
- It's up to you.
They've got you over a barrel.
You can go to jail. What's one name?
If it bothers you,
give them Hecky Brown.
- Hecky?
- He's dead anyway.
What difference does it make?
A token, that's all they want.
Show your cooperation.
- Is the witness ready to proceed?
- Yes, ready, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Prince, I ask you
for the record...
...did you know Hershel Brownstein?
Howard, you'll go to jail.
Also known as Hecky Brown?
Be practical.
Did you know him
as either Brown or Brownstein?
- Either name will do, Mr. Prince.
- Tell them.
- Brown or Brownstein.
- Just the name.
Are you refusing to answer?
Will you talk?
Fellas...
...I don't recognize
the right of this committee...
...to ask me these kind of questions.
And furthermore, you can all
go fuck yourselves.
