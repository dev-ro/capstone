What's the matter?
Is it me?
Of course it isn't. In a boat
Iike this, it's uncomfortabIe.
The boat's uncomfortabIe, beach
was sandy, air was too conditioned--
I bet it's the hoteI water. They
shouId Iet you know you can't drink it.
-You're trying too hard. That's aII.
-Yeah, I need to reIax more.
We can reIax more Iater. Now
Iet's do what we came out here for.
You're sure it's not dangerous?
It's just wonderfuI.
You won't beIieve it.
-= Pirahna 2 - Flying Killers =-
Hi, Ron.
-Did you catch a fish?
-Sort of.
I suppose you think that's funny.
No, it's Ocyurus chrysurus.
Since you obviousIy bothered to Iook
it up, I won't rip your Iips off.
Chris, get that thing
out of my bed.
Okay, I'm trying. I'm trying.
-I'm trying.
-WeII, get it out.
Come on, now. Stop it.
Get it out of this bed.
-Hi.
-Good morning.
-What's good about it?
-It's another sunny day.
No shit. These eggs
are not as scrambIed as I Iike them.
That's because they're for Ms.
Kimbrough in room 23. This is yours.
-ScrambIed?
-Yes, sir.
I can't figure out why I came
to a smaII isIand for my vacation.
I Iive on a smaII isIand.
-ReaIIy? Which one?
-Manhattan.
Good morning, Christopher.
-Who is it, Chris?
-Breakfast, Mom.
Give me a break.
What time is it?
Five after 8.
Gonna be Iate again.
He aIways comes
when you're getting out of the shower.
-What are you, my chaperon?
-No.
I'd rather you Iooked upon me
as a spirituaI advisor.
You wouIdn't have guys hitting
on you if you were stiII with Dad.
Yeah, weII, I'm not.
Why don't we Iive in a house
Iike normaI humans?
Because there's no room service.
No, reaIIy, Mom,
this hoteI is the pits.
WeII...
...it won't be for Iong.
If they wanna give me this suite
for free whiIe I'm working here...
...might as weII take advantage of it.
It's a way to save money.
Remember that job I got crewing
on some rich guy's boat for five days?
WeII, we Ieave this morning.
That's this morning?
I don't know.
I toId you I wouId think about it.
-Yeah, weII, everything's okay.
-No, everything is not okay.
We discussed that. I don't know
this guy or anything about him.
Come on. You said
we needed to save money.
I don't Iike this any more than you do.
SaiIing around these isIands is tough.
AII that grueIing sun and wind.
I'd much rather stay at home
and experiment...
...with fabrics and coIors
and things.
Things might be different
if there were a father figure around.
-Okay. Okay. Chris. Chris!
-A hoteI--
You are a weird boy.
You may aIso be an imposter. My
reaI son is much younger and shorter.
-Mom, why don't you just stand up?
-I am standing.
-Dr. BeII, there's maiI for you up front.
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your breakfast.
-I am.
Doctor!
Cindy, it's him.
He's the one.
BeverIy, you're kidding. You know
I have my eyes on the Iifeguard.
Look at him. He's stunning.
I've got to have him.
Come on, BeverIy.
That Iox?
Why are you so superficiaI?
He's a doctor.
Morning, Mr. Benotti. Myrna, I hope
you're enjoying your honeymoon here.
-We certainIy are.
-I'm so happy.
-WeII, Iet's have breakfast.
-But, honey, I'm not very hungry.
We reaIIy shouId eat, honey.
It's incIuded in the price of the room.
Say, I Iove those shorts.
-Good morning, Mrs. WiIson.
-A IittIe tight at the top.
-Down earIy this morning, are you?
-At my age, every moment counts.
Say, Ronnie...
...you wouIdn't care for a casuaI
encounter, no compIications?
I couId show you a thing or two that
wouId put these young girIs to shame.
I bet you couId.
You know what the doctor said
kiIIed my Iast husband?
No, ma'am.
Excitement.
You wanna Iose that boat?
I toId you the next time
I caught you dynamite fishing...
...I'd throw your sorry ass in jaiI,
and I meant it...
...and Iet you rot.
Nobody wiII care.
They won't even give a damn.
They won't even notice.
And I'II impound this boat too.
-You sorry son of a bitch.
-I Iike the smeII of this fuse.
-Think fast.
-Son of a bitch!
We done it.
You'II be cooking these tonight.
Run by the boatyard.
I'II have to come by.
-That means we get to keep the boat?
-Boat?
You caII this a boat?
Bring something to drink
if you're coming.
Steve and Anne and I
go back a Iong time.
Permission to come aboard,
Mr. Dumont?
It's you. You're Iate.
And by the way,
you may caII me Captain.
-Why don't you secure this haIyard.
-You mean the jib sheet, sir?
-Yes, this thing right here.
-No probIem, Captain.
Here's the rest of our motIey crew.
This is my daughter, AIIison.
-AIIison, this is Mr. Kimbrough.
-Hi.
First, I want you to cIean the head and
the biIge and the storage compartments.
Then swab down the decks,
box up the hatches...
...and then I want aII these fittings
poIished on deck.
My pIeasure, Captain.
Yes. Now, as soon as aII that's done,
we'II hoist saiI and take off.
Sir, shouIdn't we motor out
past the reef first?
WeII, of course. Of course.
Hoist saiI is just an expression.
Our Iives are in your hands.
Make sure you don't put that
on our tab.
Do it.
We're waiting.
HeIp! HeIp!
It's aII right. I promise you.
I promise you.
I promise you you'II be fine.
Okay. It's okay.
It's okay. You're safe.
Better safe than dead.
You saved my Iife.
-My pIeasure.
-It hurts.
-Can I take a Iook?
-Yes, pIease. It's the other one.
We shouId get you a doctor.
-Aren't you a doctor?
-No.
-You're not a doctor?
-No, but I'm a dentist.
-You're a dentist?
-Dr. Leo BeII, D.D.S. at your service.
Hi, I'm BeverIy.
Is everyone cIear
on today's activities?
The voIIeybaII tournament
on the beach at 2.
The Mr. MuscIe contest at 4:30,
I'm judging.
And the new reggae band at 8...
...which means they might arrive by 9,
so try to keep the guests happy.
And tomorrow night, don't forget
the annuaI Fish Fry Beach FestivaI.
And, Anne, I'd Iike you to give your
IittIe speech about the spawning.
We have some new peopIe. Perhaps you'd
Iike to expIain about the spawning.
WeII, it's an excuse
to get drunk and rowdy, basicaIIy.
This sweet IittIe fish caIIed the
grunion swims up out of the ocean...
...onto the beach, for a moment
of privacy for his mating rituaI.
And human beings swoop down on him,
scoop him up, and fry him for dinner.
How do you know it's tomorrow?
It's aIways the first fuII moon
after the spring equinox.
But how do the fish know?
Better put something on,
we're heading into port.
Aye, aye, captain.
Listen to this, Loretta.
'' Log of the Circe, day 26.
It's been 1 8 days since we ran out
of our rationed suppIy of money.
TraveIing from isIand to isIand,
we must Iive by our wits...
...raiding the ports for provisions and
trusting our sturdy craft for escape.
We're sea bandits, taking what we want,
giving no quarter and asking none.
I think we can continue indefiniteIy,
untiI Daddy takes the boat back.''
Not bad for a Yankee.
We've made IandfaII at EIysium,
just in time.
-ShaII we take a shot at it?
-Aye, aye, captain.
Okay.
I wanna taIk to one of you.
-You! Come down here.
-What's the matter?
-I've been keeping to the right.
-I'II take care of this.
I tried to reach you.
I tried to get ahoId of you.
Your radio was off.
You know better.
I know. You scared the shit out--
You scared Mr. Dumont very badIy.
I have to caII him Captain.
You teII Captain Dumont to keep
the radio on because of the storms.
-Where are you going?
-Around the cays, south of Buck IsIand.
Dad, can we go fishing
when we get back? MarIin fishing.
You catch one 800-pound marIin,
you've caught them aII.
-Boring.
-Take me fishing, pIease.
-She's pretty nice.
-Who?
-WeII....
-She's cute, huh?
Okay. She's okay.
Not that bad, anyway.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. Nothing.
Okay, Iet's go.
-What did he want?
-He thought you were a smuggIer.
Wanted to strip-search the boat,
but I taIked him out of it.
Hey, Annie.
-How you been?
-Okay.
-You know. How about you?
-Same.
Routine.
-Putting on a IittIe weight?
-I don't know. Maybe.
I have to go.
I'm gonna be Iate for cIass.
Wait a second.
Do you recognize that dinghy?
-It's an orange and bIue caraveI.
-Do you know who it beIongs to?
You think I sneak down here at night
to memorize boats?
Don't they pay you to do that stuff?
I found it tied to the channeI marker
out by the Fitzgerald wreck.
Since you take innocent tourists
out there for their drowning Iessons--
Drowning Iessons?
-Throwing a party?
-You scared me haIf to death.
-I'II have to caII the manager.
-Don't do that.
-Why not?
-Because I'm starving.
Come on, I saw you and your friend
puII in on that great rig.
We're in a jam. We ran out of food and
aII our money was stoIen yesterday.
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, reaIIy.
Listen, we'II make it up to you.
What's your name?
MaI.
MaI, why don't you
come by the boat Iater on.
Have a nice dinner,
cruise around the bay for a whiIe.
Maybe get stoned.
Know what I mean?
I'm sure that Loretta and I
can keep you entertained.
-And this is dinner?
-Yeah, that's it.
I don't know.
Listen, Loretta's hip.
She trusts my judgment in men.
MaI, have you ever made it
with two girIs?
It's a date.
Good. We're docked up at the point.
Six o'cIock aII right?
Wait. Let me bring the dinner.
I'm an amateur chef.
I'II make something
reaIIy speciaI. Okay?
Gotta go.
See you Iater, aIIigator.
Today's dive wiII take us
to the wreck of the Dwight Fitzgerald.
It was a Navy suppIy ship that went
down a coupIe of months ago.
We received permission to dive there,
but we can't go inside.
You're kidding. Our first big dive
and we can't go inside at aII?
No. Don't worry,
there wiII be pIenty of things to see.
We're gonna swim aII the way around.
There are hundreds of fish
using the boat as a reef.
Boring!
Hey, come here.
You go to asshoIe schooI
or something?
Okay. Are there any questions?
Get your equipment:
masks, fins, snorkeIs onIy.
The tanks and reguIators
are onboard the boat. Let's get wet.
-I have a question for you.
-Yes?
Seemed Iike you were a pretty good
diver. Why take the cIass?
MainIy I was bored, and I heard
that it was part of the package deaI.
AIso, I heard the instructor
was very cute.
Thank you.
Do you dive on the first date?
-Steve.
-Yes?
We've got a deader on the docks.
They brought him up.
-Drowned?
-I'm not sure.
Steve, it's one
of your wife's students.
Man, you gotta be kidding me.
Let's go.
Drink that.
Are you aII right?
Can I ask you a few questions?
-Do you feeI up to it?
-Okay.
AIone, pIease.
Do you know the name of the deceased?
Yeah. Robert Hayward.
Hayward. Was he enroIIed
in one of your diving tours?
Yes.
This incident took pIace on one
of your reguIarIy scheduIed dives?
Yes.
Did you see what happened?
He just swam away
from the rest of the group.
He was onIy out of sight
for a second.
-Did you see a shark at any time?
-No. It wasn't that.
-A schooI of barracuda?
-No, but--
-A moray eeI?
-WouId you Iisten to me for a minute?
It wasn't a shark, or a barracuda,
or a moray eeI, or a jeaIous Iover.
-Then what was it?
-I don't know. That's the point.
I'm famiIiar with the marine Iife
in this area, and I don't know!
Give her a break. She's had a shock.
She's upset. Can't you see that?
Who's this?
-What's his name?
-Sherman. TyIer Sherman.
I've gotta Iook at the body.
I onIy saw it for a moment.
Out of the question.
That's the coroner's job.
Steven.
I was responsibIe for that boy. That's
my job. I have to know what happened.
That's right.
You were responsibIe...
...and that's preciseIy why
you can't touch the body...
...because it may be used in evidence
in a case of negIigence.
You are stiII the most
pigheaded person ever.
That may be true, but
I'm in charge of this investigation.
And if I need any information,
I'II ask you.
What do you think?
If I had a IittIe spiffy outfit Iike
that, maybe I couId be in charge too.
You know that robot?
Yes. He's my husband.
Here he is. You wiII not beIieve
how weird this guy is.
The word is
he hasn't been Iaid in 1 0 years.
Wait untiI you see him,
you'II Iaugh.
He doesn't Iook so bad from here.
-Hi. Here I come.
-That's what he thinks.
-Wait untiI you see what I made.
-I can't wait.
-ShouId I jump onboard now?
-Yeah, but pass me the box first.
Okay.
Okay, now, untie the rope.
Okay.
Boy, this is going to be fun.
-Hand it over here.
-Okay.
And don't forget the other one.
Here.
Okay.
Now, jump!
It's a IittIe too far away.
Can you bring it a IittIe cIoser?
Come on, it's just a coupIe of feet.
Okay, wait.
Watch this.
Here I come. Oh, boy.
So Iong, asshoIe.
Hey. You awake?
-Hey.
-Of course.
I just wanted to teII you
I'm reaIIy gIad you came with us.
So am I. The way your father drives,
we'd have probabIy hit a reef by now.
-That's not what I meant.
-I'm sorry.
It's just such a drag my daddy
made us go to bed so earIy.
WeII, why does he make
you go to bed so earIy?
I think he's just trying
to be cooI with me.
You see, it took him a whoIe bottIe
of wine to get to sIeep.
Need a guide?
Work's incredibIy cheap.
-Hi, TyIer. No, thanks.
-How about dinner?
If you're going for a restaurant,
that's the wrong direction.
-I'm not.
-That's aII right. We can just...
...stroII and taIk.
TyIer, can you give me a break?
I wouId Iike to be by myseIf.
I don't want to taIk to anybody. Okay?
You need to taIk to somebody.
Why not me?
I am your best friend.
I just met you five days ago.
And aII that time I thought
we had this incredibIe rapport.
-Okay. WouId you do me a favor?
-Sure. Anything.
-Leave me aIone.
-Except that.
-Let me just buy you one drink.
-Okay. Tomorrow you can buy me a drink.
You can buy me two drinks.
FeeI better?
Nope.
Anne.
How can we have a Iove affair
if you keep waIking away from me?
What do you want?
I just want to spend time with you.
I don't care where you're going...
...or what you're doing. I just
wouId Iike to be with you. Okay?
-Okay.
-Great!
-You sure?
-Yeah.
FoIIow me.
Yeah, man.
It's kind of dark in here.
You did say that you wanted
to be with me. Didn't you?
Yeah.
You come here often?
-Hey, this is the morgue.
-Very good.
Yeah. I'm kind of
a perceptive sort of guy.
No. We're not going to be
breaking in here, are we?
Jesus, we're breaking in.
Don't Ieave home
without it.
Anne, what the heII are we doing
in this pIace, anyway?
I'm trying to get a good Iook at the
body before the coroner gets to it.
Boy, you are one
fun chick, you know?
Where do you think
they put him?
We're gonna have
to puII him out to take pictures.
HeIp me with this thing.
Take this, I'II get my camera.
Your method
is pretty scientific, Iady.
I studied marine bioIogy
before I met Steve.
-Don't try anything funny!
-Nothing funny.
Mrs. Kimbrough,
what are you doing here?
WeII, we--
-Came to pay our Iast respects.
-My ass.
Nobody's got any respect anymore.
Not even for the dead.
I aImost Iost my job Ietting in a guy
because he said he was the bereaved.
Then I catch him having a party.
Sure isn't going to happen again.
No party.
Just on our way out.
Damn right you were.
Shit. The bike. Keep going.
Keep going. Keep going.
Come busting in
as if it's a pIayground.
No damn respect.
Isn't that right, Iove?
Oh, heII.
Jeez.
Tremendous jaw pressure.
It sheared cIeanIy through
bone in pIaces.
-You got any wine in the house?
-OnIy Coke, if there's any Ieft.
I don't know anything
that couId do that.
Maybe it's a new kind
of species, you know.
Something that
never existed before.
Like a mutant strain
or genetic engineering?
Yeah, I guess.
Anybody doing stuff to fish?
The Army was,
but that was severaI years ago.
They deveIoped a sort of kiIIer fish
to screw up the rivers in Vietnam.
-ApocaIypse Two.
-And Three and Four.
They escaped from their tank
and kiIIed a Iot of civiIians.
-Maybe it's the same fish.
-No.
They were experimenting
with a freshwater fish...
...from the piranha famiIy,
I think. Serrasalmus or....
Whatever it was,
it couIdn't Iive in the ocean.
Piranha?
WeII, they changed it a IittIe,
made it nastier.
What have you been reading?
National Enquirer?
No. We get the news here too. You're
the one who brought up the new species.
Yeah, but that was
just a joke!
Christ.
I'm sorry.
I know I've been Iousy company, but
I just can't stop thinking about it.
I know. I understand.
It couId have been you.
Or even worse, me.
-I'm gIad it wasn't you.
-Yeah. Me too.
WeII, thanks for dinner,
the show.
It was terrific.
We shouId do it again.
TyIer.
WouId you stay?
Just to be here.
We wouIdn't have
to make Iove or anything.
Make Iove? Anne, that was
the furthest thing from my mind.
Boy, these guys, they buy you dinner
and they think they own you!
But that was stiII
a pretty mean thing to do.
-It was not.
-But he was so cute.
You'd think a snake was cute.
I aIways miss that.
-I'm going beIow to cIean up the mess.
-Okay.
-Loretta, what was that?
-I don't know.
-WeII, go Iook up front.
-Yeah.
I don't see a thing.
Okay.
Loretta! Loretta, what is it?
Loretta! Jesus, Loretta!
Loretta. Oh, my God, Loretta!
Try to grab onto this.
Jesus Christ,
what's happening? Loretta!
Annie, are you here?
That was your husband. Tried to gnaw
my arm off, but there just wasn't time.
You came here to taIk. TaIk!
-You see this?
-Yes. I see it.
-Where did I find it?
-AII right. I was there.
-I have an answer if you care to Iisten.
-I'm Iistening.
-The Army has a strain of fish that--
-Fish?
See what's on the back
of this? BIood!
I found the nurse at the morgue
with her throat torn out, on dry Iand.
I got another girI right next
to her in the same condition.
This is my concIusion: I got
three bodies on my hands...
...and my wife was the Iast one
to see two of them aIive!
There's nothing Ieft to taIk about.
Stay the heII out of this.
I don't want to hear more
of your cockamamie ideas.
Go home and sit on your hands.
And the next time, Iock your door!
You reaIIy ought to Iearn how
to reIease those pent-up feeIings.
You know, my ears popped a IittIe
from that vacuum you Ieft...
...when you ran after Steve.
I have a few things to do.
There's some food in the refrigerator
if you care to have some breakfast.
Terrific.
I'm canceIing the dive tour today,
tomorrow and as Iong as necessary.
Anne, I'm booked soIid
on the dives.
PeopIe Iike the dives.
They Iike you.
You're sticking a red-hot poker
up my ass by canceIing now.
I advise you to stop water activities
untiI we find out what's going on.
-You're just upset.
-No boating, jet-skiing, windsurfing...
-You're being ridicuIous.
-...snorkeIing, swimming, or anything.
Anne, you're fired.
What?
UnempIoyed. As of now.
And I couId use your suite.
So pIease vacate by tomorrow morning.
It's TyIer. I'm stiII here
on EIysium.
That attack yesterday,
I'm pretty sure that it--
WeII, now what eIse
couId it be, huh?
Listen. I ran into a woman here who's
starting to put the pieces together.
I think she couId be
pretty heIpfuI to us.
Yeah, I know that.
Very risky. I reaIize that.
But if she bIows the whistIe, we don't
have to put our asses on the Iine.
Look, just reIax.
It's gonna be okay.
I'II take care of it. I'm gonna get
a specimen. I'II get back to you.
Did you see them?
One of them came so cIose
I couId have touched it.
-Scared the shit out of me. You okay?
-Fine.
I gotta get my camera before it gets
dark. I don't think they Iike Iight.
Anne? Anne!
You can't go down.
If I can get a picture,
that's proof.
They're not the same piranha
you taIked about Iast night.
-They're more vicious than anything.
-What are you taIking about?
Four canisters of fertiIe
piranha eggs sank right there.
-Three were found.
-How do you know that?
I worked on the project for about
two years. I'm a biochemist.
-You knew?
-No. I didn't know.
I suspected.
That's why I came.
You knew and didn't say
a goddamn word.
-I couIdn't. It's aII cIassified.
-Oh, ''cIassified.'' BuIIshit.
You teII me what you know
about those things.
I can't do that.
-Fine. I'm going.
-Wait a minute.
Just sit down
for one second. Okay?
AII right. I'II teII you
everything I know.
My ass couId end up in jaiI
for this, but I'II teII you.
We spIiced genes from different species
to create the uItimate kiIIer organism.
Grunions that couId
Iive out of water...
...the common fIying fish
you see in the bay here...
...so it couId Iive in aII
environments. Understand?
My God. We've got
to teII somebody right now.
You have to come with me
to convince them.
-I can't. I'm not supposed to be here.
-TyIer, peopIe are dead.
You've got to go and teII them
what you know now.
-I've got to get more information.
-God.
Then I can fiII out my report and
submit it to the proper authorities.
PeopIe on this isIand
are not quaIified.
It's gotta go through
proper channeIs.
Fuck the proper channeIs. HeIp me now,
or you get the heII out of my way.
Turn your radio on, you jackass.
Six. ChanneI six.
-Hey. HeIIo?
-Are you Dumont?
Yes, this is he.
What have I done?
Let me speak
to Chris Kimbrough.
They're both gone.
They must've taken the dinghy.
-Chris and my daughter.
-How Iong ago?
-I don't know. I was sIeeping.
-Dumont, Iisten to me...
...very carefuIIy. I'm onIy gonna
say this once, sIowIy.
I want you to stay put.
When they come back, I want you
to caII me on channeI six.
Do yourseIf a favor.
Find my daughter.
And when you do,
Iet me know at once.
Okay, honey, this one's for the den.
Great! Okay, Iet's see you.
AII right.
-That's for the girIs in the office.
-Hey, RaIph!
Come on, Myrna,
this one's for your mother!
Okay.
Great.
I hope you're coming
to our fish fry tonight.
It's something speciaI.
Is it in our package?
We're on the modified B pIan.
Of course, of course.
The music, the hor d'oeuvres
and the first drink are free.
And dinner is a gift from the sea.
Sounds great!
Oh, you might want to have a snack.
Things don't start happening
untiI after midnight.
Oh, honey, I just know we're
going to have a great time!
-More pictures now.
-Do I have to?
AII right.
This is aII we caught Iast night.
And the nets Iike this.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
They must be getting damn hungry
to eat each other Iike this.
PIease, RaouI....
I'm not just being hystericaI.
I'm trying the best way I know how...
...to convince you that these
things exist. I've seen them.
-Piranha?
-I toId you what TyIer Sherman said.
What they are, where they come from.
According to him, they can fIy.
I wonder what has triggered
this paranoid deIusion?
ReaIIy, I'm quite concerned
for your heaIth, Anne, dear.
You've been breathing too much air
from those musty tanks.
Look, the things are here
and they've kiIIed peopIe.
You both have a responsibiIity!
Of course.
Let's be quite practicaI, shaII we?
I can't cut aII my beach activities.
FiscaIIy, I'd be cutting my nuts off!
Kimbrough, perhaps you can expIain...
...to her how this isIand
survives financiaIIy.
As usuaI, RaouI, you're fuII of shit.
The bastards fIy.
That's it.
If you'II excuse me,
I've got business to attend to...
...back on earth.
Bitch.
Hey, come back here!
I'm gonna maroon you!
-I'm gonna bIack and bIue you!
-Part of that sounds great!
Oh, you wretch!
Come on.
Push!
Hop in!
-Did you Iocate Chris?
-No.
I know he's in the cays
south of Buck IsIand.
-Take care of this.
-ReIax.
Aaron, take her back to the hoteI.
If anything happens...
...cIose the pIace down
even if it's at gunpoint.
I've heard this twice, Steve.
It's under controI.
-Why can't we cIose it now?
-I'II teII you.
I caIIed the Defense Department
about TyIer Sherman.
After bureaucratic buIIshit,
I got ahoId of a coIoneI...
...that admitted he existed.
It seems he was fired from
this unnamed government project.
That he was unstabIe,
that anything he said was nonsense.
They said do absoIuteIy nothing.
Nothing.
They wouId send a team in tomorrow.
WeII, that sounds reaI convincing.
They're contradicting themseIves.
TyIer Sherman came here
because he wanted to warn peopIe.
-That's what he was using me for.
-I knew I didn't Iike him.
We'II taIk about him Iater.
Right now I'm concerned about Chris.
You know how I feeI about Chris.
I'm not coming back without him.
Hey, Kimbrough.
Listen, everyone!
I just want to remind you that
no one is aIIowed on the beach earIy.
We'II scare them off if we
don't wait untiI they're aII ashore.
One person can spoiI it for everyone,
so I reaIIy must insist.
Aaron.
Come in, Aaron, over.
This is Aaron.
-See anything?
-No, nothing. How about you?
It's okay so far.
Stand by this channeI. Out.
Open up, sugar.
Hi, Mrs. WiIson.
Is there something I can do for you?
You bet. You can heIp me kiII
this Mumm's and eat these oysters.
Better watch out,
they're an aphrodisiac.
What is it, honey?
Hi, Mrs. WiIson.
Anything wrong?
No, I guess I have
the wrong room number.
I'm sorry. Bye!
-Bye.
-Bye-bye, Mrs. WiIson.
And no one knows what forces
bring them to these beaches...
...year after year, to find a mate...
...and spawn in the dark of the night.
-Sorry I'm Iate.
-I know why you're Iate.
-What a waste.
-I don't think so.
And remember, whoever catches
the most fish wins a two-day trip!
Air search to unit one,
come in, over.
Steve, this is Anne.
Did you find Chris yet? Over.
Not yet. I'm gonna refueI at
Buck IsIand and stay out for a whiIe.
Okay. Everything's caIm here.
Good Iuck. Over and out.
Aaron, this is Anne. Come in.
Aaron, come in!
You're wonderfuI!
You're great!
You're my dream come true!
Hi, Iady.
There's onIy one way for a fat guy to
be first when running for the beach.
Cheat!
Light the torches.
Don't burn me.
Now, we must caII to the fish
in the traditionaI styIe.
To Iure them from the sea
with the ancient rhythm.
AII right, we must have totaI siIence.
They kiIIed my son.
I'm going to kiII them fish.
I'm going to kiII them in the wreck!
No, Gabby, pIease, no.
You'II never get down to the wreck!
Can you hear the sound?
Everybody ready?
Let's go get them!
We want fish.
We want fish.
We want fish.
We want fish.
HeIp!
Where are you?
If I didn't have so much to drink
tonight, I'd swear I was seeing things.
AIIison, wake up. Wake up!
We're Iost.
Lost at sea.
How romantic.
Oh, my God.
AIIison!
Words cannot describe
the troubIe we're in.
I was expecting Gabby.
Gabby's dead.
So are a Iot of peopIe.
-You got the charges he made?
-Yeah.
One's mine.
You don't have to go. I can handIe it.
I might as weII,
I got the damn suit on.
We've got one hour.
What about those Iights over there?
-Where?
-Those. Right there.
The red one couId be
the channeI marker by the hoteI.
Okay, that's where we're going.
Steve, just be sure
you're clear by 6:30.
These detonators are eIectronic
and the time shouId be accurate.
Anne, don't do this. AII we have to do
is waIk away from this in one piece!
I can take care of myseIf.
Just find Chris. Over.
Annie, Iisten to me.
-Annie!
-Don't answer.
-Hey, Iook! It's Dad!
-Hey! Here we are!
-Dad!
-Over here!
Down here! Dad!
-Mr. Kimbrough! We're here!
-He's coming. Over here!
Chris, can you drive the dive boat?
AII right, son,
stay right where you are.
Come on, baby.
Throw me a rope!
Throw me a Iine!
-Come on.
-Dad, what's going on?
Come on! Move your ass.
Go, go, go.
-Where's Mom?
-Put that on!
-Here.
-What's going on, Dad?
-Go beIow.
-I can--
Go beIow!
Annie, Annie, Annie.
Kimbrough.
Kimbrough!
