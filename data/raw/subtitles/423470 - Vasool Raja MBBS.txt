He is a collection king.
He's a collection king.
He's a collection king.
He's a collection king.
He's a collection king.
My hand...
Leave my hand man.
Hi Gangaroo...
Not Gangaroo. He's Gangarathan.
He's Gangadaran.
What's it?
Didn't you say that we can't collect
money from you?
Did you see?
l've hired the collection king.
Hey, don't talk too much.
Am l an auto or a horse to be hired?
Give respect to my profession.
Are you the one who
hasn't given the payment?
Then why're you looking
like a decent man?
Why haven't you returned his money?
Take the phone.
l'll give the phone to you.
you ask your wife to
bring Rs.20 lakhs here.- Why?
Otherwise your body will be
sent to your house in instalments.
Hey phone...
Tell me which part of your body,
your wife likes most.
l'll first cut that &
send it to your house.
My beard.
Then you cut his neck
and sent it to his house.
Why did you entrust me to these rowdies?
- He's calling you rowdy!
Hey, whom are you calling rowdy?
- l'll kill you.
What we're doing is social service.
We'll collect money and do charity.
For example, 20 lakhs which
you should pay him,
will be collected by us from you.
We'll take our 10% commission from that
and give the rest to him.
Understand? This is our rule.
Now you talk about the money.
l gave it to your brother, didn't l?
He collected half of
the money & went to Dubai.
Don't talk about him.
l want my money.
Why did you give it to him?
You only asked me
to give it to your brother.
l just blabbered when l was boozed.
Why did you take it seriously?
Collection king, ask him.
Why're you beating me?
You made me to go wrong.
- Ask him like that.
No, he's at fault.
This is wrong.
Hey give the phone.
Call your wife.- Why?
Tell me which part she likes?
l'll cut that & send it to her.
His beard.
Shit! This case seems to be problematic.
Call your wife,
and ask her to bring 2 lakhs.
- Why?
10% in 20 lakhs is 2 lakhs.
You made us to lose that amount
by your lie.- What's this edict?
Phone your wife.
Why're you phoning me
instead of phoning your wife.
Hello....- Hello.
Father...- Dear...
l didn't say 'dear'...
Wrong connection.
No right connection.
Vatti...Dr.Vatti...- Yes Dr.Raja.
Discharge the old patient Gangadaran.
Admit the new patient Maniraja.- Oh god!
Point is, they're taking

Hey...Pickpocket.- Leave me.
Hey...catch him...
- Don't beat me.
Stop beating him...
it's an empty purse.
lt's enough, go men.
You've grown up, haven't you?
Why're you doing such thing?
l left my native place & came here.
l don't know how to lead proper life.
That's why l stole.
My son had also left his native place.
Do you know, what is he now?
Welcome, bless me.- Long live.
l got late because of the traffic.
Look, come with me.
My son is a great doctor.
He'll heal your wounds.
SRlMAAN VENKATRAMAN FREE HOSPlTAL.
My son has built this
hospital in my name.
Very proud!
Come on father.
- Please come.
Everything is alright?
lt's a very busy hospital.
Look, how many patients are there.
Where is Raja?
Brother, your parents have come.
What're you doing?
l had told them that
you're doing an operation.
Why did you say like that?
Being a doctor,
you should wear a coat.
Shouldn't a doctor eat?
Let's all do the operation.
- We too?
Don't you know about 'co-operation'?
You just do that.
Assistant, you hold this leg.
You hold this leg.
l also want a leg.
- You hold this.
l'm going to cut the hand now.
Come here.
He's operating the hand.
What is patient's name?
- Broiler doctor.
Have you informed its family?
All its relatives
are here.
All belong to one family.
- You're a family doctor, right?
Doctor, when are we discharging the
patient?- When?
lt has gone inside, right?
Then it can be discharged
only in the morning.
Without laughing, do the operation.
Will you have this?- Yes.
ls it over? Doctor.
What's this?
Why condiment smell is coming
from the operation theatre?
That is...world is like that.
People are demanding 'masala movies'
in theatres as well as in hospitals.
Those movies are shown in theatres,
and operation is
also done in theatres.
This man is suffering
from severe pain.
lt seems like 'inner wound'.
- lnner wound?
Greetings doctor.- Greetings.
Oh, you...are you doctor?
Admit him.
0 Come on...we'll give you treatment.
Hey take the patient carefully.
Why did you lock him inside?
You said its an 'inner wound', right?
That's why, l had sent him inside.
lf there was a wound on his outer body,
we would've treated him outside.
lf it's...
- 'Perukayam'(big wound).
We'll put assafoetida in the gravy.
Sir, l've bought the money you asked for.
- Come on...slowly...
You please send my husband back.
Vatti, explain to her.
Sir, l've bought interest also.
You'll get a good husband.
lt's enough for me.
Why're you not
choosing a proper husband?
Come on...He's in that ward.
He's still a patient.
My husband....
Come man...- They said that your
parents have come.
Give it them.
Wow! You really look like a doctor.
You too look like a tender coconut seller.
Did l pass any comment?
What's it on the tender coconut?
You carry on.
Won't you believe
our brother is a doctor?
l've seen you here earlier.
Haven't you got cured yet?
What's your complaint?
Heart attack.
Brother..
Are they giving you an award?
Why're you acting too much?
Having a fractured hand,
you're saying 'heart attack'?
Does this briefcase has correct amount?
- Yes.
Go without tension.
Your husband will come home.
Don't beat...- lf l see you here
next time...
Don't come to this area.
Amount is collected.
You can go now.
Hey, what is happening here?
- 'Big show' go man...
Oh god.- Go man...
Brother, for how long you should
be in the disguise of a doctor?
Do you know the proverb?
One day or other,
quack doctor will get caught.
That is meant for thieves.
Let it be l'm talking
about quack doctors.
Brother, are you finished?
Lets go down.
Why is he interfering?
lf it's a personal matter,
why can't you go down & talk privately?
Why're you standing on
such a high building?
l'm afraid of heights.
l'm scared to see actor Amitab batchaan.
You're afraid of heights,
and brother is afraid of his father.
Brother, why can't you tell
your father that you're not a doctor?
Why do you want me to remove my
moustache for a week's play.
You start first.
Mother, brother wants to
talk an important matter with father.
Dad, l want to talk about a
real..true thing to you. - Both are same.
ls it? - Yes.
You might have thought that
l'm a doctor.
l'm not the doctor as you think.
- Then what type of a doctor are you?
l'm, in this locality... with my friends...
collecting. l'm doing that only.
You're collecting huge money from rich,
and treating poor people free.
No, the way l earn money is...
What is there in earning money?
A smuggler is earning.
A village panchayat
leader is earning.
A rowdy is earning.
Hubby, he's trying to say something...
but he's afraid..
Come here dear.
'Embracing therapy'.
Now have you got the courage?
Tell your father.
l don't know whether
l've the courage.
But l've lost fear,
and become clear.
Now l'm not confused.
- What was your confusion?
Nothing. As you've been
thinking, l'm a doctor. l can't change it.
Brother, inspite of doing so many rehearsals,
why did you spoil our entire plan?
Mother gave 'Embracing therapy'.
So l became brave & told lies.- Why?
Did you see my father?
He has become old.
l would've told the truth,
if he was middle aged.
lf l tell him the truth,
and he might die of heart attack.
Having dot & flowers,
my mother looks beautiful. Without them....
Oh god! Why're you talking like this?
She's mother for us also.
You're a doctor.
Hey go man...go...
Mind your work.
How is your business going on?
- lt's going on smoothly.
Who are they?
Why're they unnecessarily
laughing in the park?
What do they want?
Since they're very rich
they've gone mad.
Okay, let them go to hell.
Give me a tender coconut.
Give me a tender coconut.
- Okay sir.
Excuse me Sir, l've seen you somewhere.
Doctor Viswanath?- Yes.
You're Mr.Venkatraman,
aren't you?- Correct.
Sir, do you know him?
When they built a hospital in
our village for the 1st. time,
he was the 1st doctor there and worked
for 2 years.- Yes 2 years
How are you here?
Have you heard of
''Srimaan Venkatraman Hospital''.
Who's hospital is that?
- Dr.Rajaraman?
He is my son.
Surprising! - What is surprising about it?
We slice the coconut thinking it'll be tender,
but it turns out to be immature.
No...l know all the
doctors in this city.
Who is Rajaraman?
- He's a famous doctor.
Sir, do you want tender coconut or
immature one? - Will you please shut up?
Why all of them were laughing?
lt was an exercise for good health.
lt's called 'Laughter therapy'.
lf you lose your temper,
you should start laughing.
Your Blood pressure will come down.
How can you laugh,
when you're getting angry?- lt's difficult.
But if you practice,
it is possible.
Okay leave it. How is
your daughter, Pappu?
She is fine. She has gone
to the hospital.
You said she is fine and
she has gone to the hospital?
She is a doctor.
She has studied medicine.- Doctor?
ls she married?- No,
that is a big problem.
l've shown 50 doctor's
photos to her.
She is asking me, how can
l marry a stranger?
The one who was friendly with her,
and l know him for a long time.
He is also a doctor, good boy.
Wow! lt's there in the pocket.
Look, he is the boy.
Tell your opinion.
ls he your son, Raja?
l can give this photo
through an exchange offer.
l got your point.
You're asking for bride's photo. l'll give.
Being a doctor,
l'm telling you seriously...
Father, l'm not interested
in marriage.
Finally, what do you want to say?
Finally what can l say?
l'll ask her about it.
What's it dear?
Mother, l'm a doctor. l'm not interested
in marriage. Tell him.
lt's not that dear.
- Kasthuri, stop cajoling him, let's go.
Where are you going?- To our place.
- Why?
Look, you can't deceive me.
Now you aren't the doctor.- Oh god!
You're my son.
- You got tensed so soon.
He's right.
Shouldn't we've the desire to fondle
our grand children?
Doctor...
They're calling you only.
Tell me.
Not that.
Your opinion about my marriage.
- No marriage.
No? Why?
Already you both got married, right?
- May be at the age of 60...- Hey doctor.
What?
He's a day doctor and
he's a night doctor. He's leaving after duty.
Operation is waiting.
l'll see you later.
Father, you sit down.
Who is Rajaram? He's a doctor.
22 hrs duty. He can't
close the shop.- Shop?
That is, he can't close the door of the
hospital. Will his would-be know this?
That's why, if his would-be is a doctor,
then she will know him better.- You are right.
A doctor's problem is known
better only to another doctor.
Why're you laughing?
lt's coming.
Why?
Tomorrow we're going to
see the bride. She is also a doctor.
Brother, l will wait outside.
Give the photo.
Can you recognise her?
l've heard about 'child specialist'.
But here a child itself is a doctor?
Tell me who is this child?
- l don't know.
Pappu.
Oh! Neighbour Pappu.
Neighbour Pappu.- My neighbour Pappu.
Will you be quiet?
Look tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.
- lnauspicious time...?
No, we're going to see the bride.
Because of your views,
now l've to see that doctor bride.
Brother, l said like that
to save you.
That Pope....- Which Pope?
That 'Seepu'...- Seepu?
Yuck! Say 'Pappu'.
How could l know that
she is a doctor?
You're the only doctor,
who l know.
What to do? You too aren't a doctor.
How long have you been friendly
with that 'Pappu'?
She is 'Pappu' man.
- Okay 'Pappu'.
l know her from my childhood.
That means?
lt's the opposite of grown up.
Don't irritate me.
l mean to say that
l know her from my childhood.
ln the childhood, being smart,
fair and having chubby cheeks,
and combing the hair properly,
and applying powder around the neck.
Brother...you're really great.
You remember 'Pappu'
of childhood days.
Hell with you.
l'm talking about myself.
l was looking like
that in my childhood.
Then Pappu?- She also
looked like that.
Her body & figure varied,
since she's a girl.
We were playing exuberantly.
- Then what?
She matches you, right? Marry her.
You're talking without
knowing the facts.
That girl is dreaming to marry a real
doctor. Do you want me to spoil that?
You've to rape her
on your nuptial night,
after that, tell her that
you aren't a doctor.
l didn't mean that. - You fix another
day for that.- Excellent, he is right.
What's right?
Nuptial night for one week?
Just a minute please.
Pappu...
Guess who's on the line?
Who is it?- Groom.
Dr.Raja is on the line.
Talk to him.
Talk nicely.
Dad, if you don't mind. - No, l
don't mind. You carry on... - But l mind.
Raja, you've troubled me
a lot in my childhood.
Now, fate is bringing me closer to you.
Why l phoned you is to tell you that
l'm not your old friend Raja.
Now l've changed a lot.
Now l'm called 'collecting Raja'.
lf you want me to explain,
it's like rowdy, Dada
and collecting debts etc.
l'm not interested in marriage.
Since my parents forced me,
l've agreed to come & see you.
When l come there,
you reject me giving some reason.
Don't insult me badly.
Really? What reason shall l give them?
You tell me.
Tell them ''Groom is very handsome.
So l don't like him''.
Joke?- lt's not a joke.
Look, if my father comes to knows that
l'm not a doctor, that's all...
He's an honest... - Police officer?
Should the word 'honest' always
relate to a police officer?
He's a school teacher.
lf he comes to know about this,
he will be worried.
lf you respect our 20 yrs friendship,
don't tell anything to him, okay?
He can't tolerate it.
He will die of heart attack.
He will live for 100 years.
- What is the matter?
Raja, l'm also not a doctor,
as you think. l'm a Cabaret dancer.
My father is owning a wine shop.
So when you come to see the bride,
say ''l don't like her''.
Father, l'm talking to my friend
regarding medical matters.
Bye.
Are you making fun of me?
l'm talking to you and
you're looking at the photo?
Sir, do you want to collect
balance amount from any person?
No.
Are you going to kidnap someone?
- What do you mean?
Then why're you keeping
this photo here?
He is the one who is
going to marry Pappu.
What? Are you going to perform
Pappu's marriage with a rowdy?
What're you blabbering?
You own such a big hospital.
You don't know to select a
good groom for your daughter.
Look dear, don't cry. l'll get you
married to a prince.
Hi. - Hi daddy.
You didn't go to the hospital?
No, you said that
Raja is coming, right?
l forgot to tell you.
He phoned, it seems they're
coming here after a week.
You can go to the hospital.
Okay, what about you?
l've some work. l'll come later.
- Okay Bye.
You may even perform my
marriage.- We will.
lf it gets late.... Hey Raja, come here...
- l'm coming.
lf l get late....
You phone me frequently.- Okay.
Say emergency, urgent work etc.- Okay.
Hello, doctor here.Brother,
l'm Vatti speaking. Hey who is fooling me?
Vatti is standing infront of me...
- lt's me only.
Why did you call me on phone?
Didn't you ask me to phone you
frequently?- But not this way.
Then?
Okay. Hello...- Hello.
Put the phone down.- Okay.
There's no pocket.
Even there, there is no pocket.
- Okay.- lt's nothing father.
There's no pocket in my shirt.
Phone me later.
l'll come.
What's this Hubby?
'Laughter Therapy' to decrease tension.
Well doctor Raja...
ln which college,
did you study medicine?
The one which is before
the central station.
Central jail is there.
No, that is on the
other side of the canal.
There's a general hospital
on its other end.- Wow! Lovely.
Great doctors have studied
in that famous hospital.
Your phone is ringing.
l'm Vatti here.
- Yes doctor speaking.
Brother, is everything
going on smoothly?
ls it?
You do one thing you give a
bottle of glucose to the patient.
l'm on the way. Ask them not to worry.
l like your commitment.
lt seems you've opened a
hospital on your father's name?
He was telling me proudly.
Look at his face.
Look how proud he feels.
Let it ring. Why're you getting tensed?
l'll give you as much as
you want for marrying my daughter.
Money?!
Why brother isn't picking up the phone?
Father, we'll make a move. You
consider that l didn't like this girl.
Who are you man?
Are you a doctor like my daughter?
Do you've the right to marry her?
What's happening here?
Your son isn't a
doctor as you think.
He's a rowdy.
Shut up.
He's collecting money
by organising committees.
He'll threaten, beat or kidnap people
for money. This is his profession.
lf you're unaware of it,
you're a big fool in this world.
Please ask him.
Tell me.
Raja, you...aren't you a doctor?
We unnecessarily troubled you.
Please forgive us.
Great insult.
Doctor, No:2 patient is very serious.
Doctor please come immediately.
Out...
How is it possible?
You didn't beat or hit me.
But you have taken
away my soul!
Get lost.
Come on let's go.
- Where hubby?
We should go some where
away from him. That's all.
lf you leave me and go, there's no
one for me. What can l do?
Being an elderly person,
don't you know?
You garland our photo & keep it.
Hereafter, there's no relationship
between you and me.
Understood?
Go man.
No...don't make me
cry once again.
Go...
Get lost.- Get lost.
- l'm going.
Come on..
Why did you lie?
- Mother, out of fear l said like that.
After leaving our place and earning
so much of money here,
l thought father will ask me
''How are you?''.
lnstead he asked me
''what are you doing''?
lnstead of worrying him,
l lied that l've become a doctor.
l said like that to make him happy.
Mother, l've told the truth, right?
What have you decided?
His decision is mine.
What did l say?
What did l say man?
l requested her to say that
she's not interested in this marriage,
and she didn't like me.
l told her not to hurt my father,
but she has behaved otherwise?
Brother, Pappu has revealed the truth.
Tell me, how should we punish her?
We can't do anything to her.
l know her from my childhood.
l'm destined to be like this, forget it.
Who is that removing the board? l've
written my father's name. Let it be there.
Let it be as it is.
l'm a strong man.
He had said that
l've taken away his soul.
Why did he say like that?
- Why?
Because l'm a fool.
l'm not a doctor.
What should l do as a son?
- What you should do?
l should become a doctor.
Okay, you become one. Lets talk
about it in the morning.
Since l'm boozed up, you want
me to talk in the morning?
l'm very clear.
l'm going to marry Pappu.
l'm going to join a medical
college and become a doctor.
l'm going to make her father laugh
throughout his life.
lf a hero says, he will do it,
only then he's called a 'hero'.
He knows 'Sidda'.
He knows even tricks.
He knows to read pulse.
He knows to read people's mind.
He's a versatile doctor.
Oldy, where we'll get admission?
Here we'll get admission.- Here?
Can't you see the board?
- Govindasamy, have your chit.
You've got the admission.
- Thank you.
Brother, you were feeling shy.
That old man got the admission.
- How is it possible?
Don't know what was his challenge?
ls this queue meant for challengers?
What man?- Give way.
- ls this an admission queue?- Yes.
You're standing
at the right place.
Why all are looking sick persons?
Here you'll be admitted,
if you fall sick.
What are you talking? Do we've to become
criminals before becoming lawyers?
Do we've to become thieves,
before becoming policemen?
Do we've to become bachelors,
before getting married?
Am l right?
Why're you confusing me?
Come here man.
Leave it and come.
l've not come here to get
admitted as a patient.
l want to join the
medical college & become a doctor.
Really?
Same thing.- What? l was in the
mental hospital for 10 years.
l used to stay that
''l want to become a health minister''.
Who? - Me. Oh god.
They treated me and left me here.
You also join here.
You'll become alright.
Go and meet the Dean.
Everybody can become a doctor.
Dean is in the theatre.
Shall l take leave?- Okay.
They said theatre,
but it's like a different place.
Why is he lying down?
Doctor, have you allowed them
inside by collecting tickets?
All look like murderers.
Who's the Dean here?
What is happening here? Out...
who are you? All of you get out. Nonsense.
Get lost. What's this injustice?
Like something entering through
an open door...- Are you calling us dogs?
Am l wrong?
Why're you relating the
word'something' to dogs?
lt may be lion, tiger.- Hey, we want
to get an admission urgently.
For that, how can you come
inside the operation theatre?
To do 2 operations at the same time,
is our Dean, a barber?
Or is this a hair cutting saloon?
My brother wants a
medical seat in this college.
There's an entrance examination.
You score high marks in that.
Only then you'll
get the admission.
Do you want our brother to
write an entrance examination?
Whether he's brother or grandfather,
entrance examination is compulsory.
Did you write it?
l'm a state first student.
Congratulations.
What's your name?
Address?- Wow!
What's this?- They will get excited,
if l ask the address.
Marka Bandhu, Arindhel colony, first street.
Marka Bandhu.. first street.
lt is poetic.
One important thing.
Sorry, before writing the exam.,
lf you take Yoghart shake,

so says my mother, take it.
What operation is going on inside?
- Piles.
Don't forget to wash your hands.
Brother, come without
touching anyone.
Sorry, l suspected all of you.
- lt is alright.
Even my father used to say that
if you take Yoghart shake,
you will write well in the exam.
Have it.- Hey leave me.
Stop it man. Stop it.
Hey its all wrong.
- What is wrong in this?
Collection king, listen to me.
lt's wrong to write
exam. for other person.
Am l afraid to write exams.?
l couldn't get through the exams.
from my 5th std.
When l was in 5th std,
l failed in all the subjects.
Shut up.
Hey don't use a bad word.
lt's not a bad word.- ls it?- Yes.
Why is he saying like that?- No idea.
ls it very important now?
You please look into my problem.
Why are you laughing?
Okay, leave it.
- Finally l'm asking you...please...
Why're you having a business deal?
l'm telling you,
go & write the exam.
lf you did well,
your father will be okay.- Or else...
that's all..
My son will definitely pass.
Then you'll go to college.
What's the problem in that?
Then with whom can l play carrom?
Come on...you too study medicine.
l'll study medicine & you
struggle little bit & study it.
The one who is writing for me,
won't he write it for you?
Father...
Father...
Brother, you've become a doctor.
lt's not bad, you got the highest marks.
How much l've scored?
l never thought that Marga Bandhu
will get such marks.
Good, they really
made me a doctor.
What's this? Whose child is born?
- You've become a doctor.
Otherwise how was it possible,
no one is married here.
What happened?
- Phone is ringing.
Hello. Yes, l'm doctor MBBS speaking.

Tell me the matter.
Child...
What happened?
How many times?
Oh dysentery?
You don't worry.
Shit! Close it.

Sir, what is this?
Suicide case, he took poison.
You're saying it so casually.
Sir, froth is coming out of his mouth...
Sir, admit him.- What is this man?
There's a procedure for that.
You should fill up a form.
So many formalities are there.
Look his mother is on the line.
Keep quiet.
Doctor, it seems this patient
had taken poison.
Can you treat him?
Police case.
Did you inform? - Whom?
The police.- l'll inform them.
You treat him.
My duty time is over.

Khalidas sir.
What is this form?
- Admission form.
Fill up this form

What should l write?
Write down that his hand is
fractured and bones are broken.
He is alright, isn't it?
l'm talking about his future.
Sir, don't want.
He's a good doctor.
Shouldn't a good doctor
treat a patient?
l'll treat him, leave my hand.
- Treat him.
You should place it on
your ear and see, am l right?
l've become a doctor
after studying MBBS.
Sorry, l'm a first year student,
l just had a doubt.
You carry on.
Have a look without
giving him pain.
Thanks a lot.
What poison did he take?
- Rat poison.
Rat poison.
Rat poison.
Madam, before closing the counter,
show me the way first.
Look, talk to my father about everything.
Where is your father?
Tell me the way to go there.
Oh since you don't know the way,
you didn't come that day?
When?- Have you forgotten?
Do you know Adyar bridge?
Near that bridge,
if you turn right? On the left side...
Are you poking fun?
Does your college extend upto Adyar?
lf l ask ''where is 3rd
year class'',
you may say
''it's in Chengalpet''.
Are you making fun of me?
l'm a first year student.
lf l create problem, then
you've to close the college.
Student? They said you're a doctor.
My boys would've said that.
They're predicting my future title.
Anyhow, l'm going to be
Rajaram MBBS.
For the time being, l'm 93.5 F.M.
Give the full form of F.M.
Don't know? 'First mark'.
93.5 marks.- First mark?
Are you asking ''how did l get it''?
Why everybody is asking me
the same question?
You should believe persons
at the first sight.
Where there is a will,
there is Margabandhu...
There is a way.
Okay. l just saw your name, show me.
l've known your name.
But l don't know the way.
Tell me the way.
Why is she dumb?
Silence means acceptance.
Groom, you go
straight & turn right.
Groom?
Okay, thank you, my girl.
She is connecting me with her.
- Hey, good choice.
Good morning sir.
Good morning sir.
Welcome to SLRM institute
of medical science.
l'm Dr.Viswanath, the Dean
of this institution.
Please sit down.
Hey Vatti, you fool...
- What's it brother?
Did you find only this
college in this city?
What're you talking?
What happened?
Are you asking me the reason?
Pappu's father is here.
What is he doing there?
He's giving a big lecture
in front of the mike.
Present elite doctors have
studied in this college only.
Now tell me.
Who is having great qualities
to become elite doctors?
l...
Good, l like your confidence.
Hands down please.
You...
What is your name?- Nimmi.
ls it audible?- Yes.
Now tell me. What is your
special quality?
Why do you want to become a doctor?
- Humaneness.
l didn't get you.
'User friendly' in computer,
and 'customer friendly' in business.
Similarly doctors should
be 'patient friendly'.
By realising the pain of patients,
Being a doctor, l want to
serve them in a friendly manner.
This is not a'Asylum'
to show affection and kindness.
This is a hospital.
Please sit down.
Well, look at my hand.
Till now, l might have done
1000's of operations.
But my hands never shivered.
Why?
Because l won't love my patients.
But tomorrow in case if
l operate my daughter,
who knows on that day,
my hands may shiver.
You know why...?
Because of that concern & love
which you had mentioned.
Feelings.
According to us, a patient
is just a body.
Our mind shouldn't think
about his whereabouts or status.
You're going to learn only
this in your 5 years of studies.
Well, that's it for today.
Any other questions.
Yes, one question.
ln case, if a patient comes
to the hospital with his mouth frothing,
will you immediately take
him to the operation theatre,
and save him by giving Chloroform.
Or will you ask him to fill up
the admission form and let him die?
Your classes start tomorrow
at 8 'o' clock sharp. See you.
Hello, why're you going away?
Like 'Vikramadthiyan and devil',
Everyday l'll ask you questions
lying on your shoulder.
You've to answer my questions.
You've to. You're paid for that only.
93.5% V.Rajaraman.
Sir, why're you seeing it
through lens?- Why?
Figures will be seen big &
you'll get tensed. - Will you shut up?
How did he get 93.5%.
How is it possible?
Sir, how do l know?
- You're right.
How do you know?
How do you know?
Have you written the exam.?
Father, l've a doubt.
You showed this man's photo to me
saying ''this is doctor Raja'',
and you said that
they will come to see me.
l didn't know that
he is a big fraud.
That's why, l stopped you.
He is a big rowdy.
Collection king. He will hold courts.
Not an ordinary one.
But a 'powerful court'.
Wait, have you seen him?
l've seen him. He asked
me the way.- What?
Does he know that
l'm your daughter?- Daddy.
No control yourself. Does he know that
you're my daughter?
He doesn't know.- Thank god.
Thank god.
Sir, shall l tell him that
she's my daughter?- Shut up.
Brother, do you want to
stay in this hostel?

Let the room number be 678.
6, 7, 8...lf we add

Why're you bothered?
Fridge is here. A.C. will come now.
You can use my hair oil
perfume, powder etc.
Except my underwear.

Did you wash your hands
after going to toilet?- Yes.
Shake hands Gopinath,
lets become friends.
Sir my name is Swaminathan.
Do you know another matter?- Tell me.
lf l say something,
you shouldn't deny it. Got it.
My name is Swami sir.
What did l tell you now?
Call me as you like,
Swami or Gopi?
lf my father comes to see me,
can he call me Swami?
Shall l change your father's name?
Let it be Sambu.- Sit down.
Give an inch you take a foot,
do you've a heater in bathroom?
Yes, but is under repair.
Okay, l'll replace it
with another one.
Oh boss.- Couldn't you lock the door?
He's a rustic fellow.
- What happened?
lt's a western type.
Doesn't suit me.
lf l lose the balance...
l'll pass it after going home.
Can you manage till such time?
- l think l can.
Excuse me what's the procedure
to change the room?
First year? Come on...
What do we have to do to
change the room?
First you've to change your dress.
Are you ragging?
They said there's no
ragging in this college.
We had spread the rumour like that.
You come...come dear...
l became major in may 98.
From that day, l'm restless.
Hey come on...
- Please leave me brother.
Why're you feeling shy?
Brother, please don't remove my shirt.
Hey remove it...
- Please brother.
Why're you troubling Samu?
What is happening here?- Ragging.
ls it called ragging?
Wow! Explain the term 'ragging'.
No sir, he's a first year student,
So we are ragging.
Since l don't have sacred
bead around my neck, you didn't rag me.
l'm also a first year student.
You rag me too. Come on...
He's a versatile doctor.
What Sambu? You too come
and join me.
What's harm in this?
l'm here. Come on.
Hey senior, where're you going?
Go that side.
Dance...dance through your eyes.
Dance like this...dance.
To roam around the town with you,
l'll sit on your back.
l'll play 'hide and seek'
by closing your eyes. ls this walk enough?
Do you want more?
ls that clear now? Any doubt.
Raise your hand.- Why?
You're asking 'why' after raising
your hand. You'll become a great doctor.
l've raised the question.
l know what all we face after
eating these peanuts.
But can we become
brilliant? Tell me.
Vikramathiyan is ready to
answer my question.
Get out.
That can't be an answer.
lf this man doesn't
leave the class now.
This will be my
last class in this year.
Raja, please go out.
Okay...okay...
Sambu, listen carefully what sir
says note it down & tell me in detail.
l'll learn without a
teacher like Ekaleevan.
No, Ekalaivan.- Something
like that. Give way.
l'll go now and come tomorrow.
You take this along
with your girl friend.
Respect for love.
Sir, what's the procedure for
changing the room?
Shut up and sit down.
Hello Vatti...- Brother.
World war has started
between me and the Dean.
Hello....- Hello.
l didn't say 'hello' to you.
l said to someone else.
He shot an arrow on me.
l shot it back.
His arrows missed the mark. Students
laughed at him.
He stood there
armless and crestfallen.
Was he not dressed?
- He was fully dressed.
You said he wasn't dressed.
- No not that.
Armless means without weapons.
ln what language?
- Assume any language. Leave it man.
Ask me what l did?
- What did you do?
l left the classroom.
Others shouldn't get disturbed.
Thank god! Pappu isn't working here.
Otherwise she would've
been terribly upset.
Mr, what're you talking
about Pappu?
Just a minute.
Lollipop.
Why're you shouting?
Why? Will everyone ask for it?
What 'ish'? l'll shout.
This is my college.
More than that, this is my
father-in-law's college.
Wait, l've a wedge(aapu) for you.
No....you said 'pappu'...
No, l said, l've a 'aapu' for you.
lt doesn't mean Pappu
will be my concubine?
This Pappu and Dean are one.
Why? What did Pappu do?
- How can l explain to you in brief?
Assume you're Pappu. l'm there.
We both are engaged. Don't feel shy.
l didn't feel shy, carry on.
But if this marriage is performed,
your life will be ruined.- Why?
She will come to know that
l'm a 'collectionist'.
What?
lt's like terrorist, typist cyclist etc.
You listen to my story. What l do is..
l'll phone you & ask you to reject me,
when l come to see you. Understood?
Yes, you said it earlier 'armless'.
That means without weapons. This is
rejection. - Oh okay. Listen to my story.
You'll think that our next scene
will be bride-seeing function.
No, there will be a
twist in the screenplay.
You'll tell this to Dean.
Then he will talk,
to my father insultingly.
My parents are shell shocked
by the insult heaped on them.
Now comes the interval.
Then what?
Then go and have a drink.
Sorry friend.
l'm narrating my entire
story to her.
Who is she?
She has again covered it
with her hands.
Janaki.
Bye.
Then?
- What then?
Narrate the entire story.
He's also asking the same thing. He has
listened to it earlier also. Repeat audience.
Shall l start from the beginning?
l and Pappu are childhood friends.
We used to play together.
This is the theory
class of this session.
We make an incision on the skin
at the centre of the body.
The outer layer of
the skin is called...
Epidemus...- Very good.
Once we peel off the skin.
We'll be able to
see the muscle layer.
What?
l'm trying to see.
What're you seeing?- Body.
lt isn't stomach for you doctor.
lt is abdominal cavity.
Hey Sambu...
What 'ish'? Being a vegetarian
you're standing first.
Uncleaned fish cart
is better than this. This dead body..
Don't call it a dead body
call it cadaver.
Patients are struggling
for their lives.
Here you're tinkering with the body.
What do you want?
Why're you tinkering?
This's the destruction
of the abdominal cavity.
How do you know it?
- How will l? They're all covering.
Shouldn't l see the body?
- lf you want, bring a fresh body.
Really?
l want a body urgently.
What size?
l didn't want a bodice.
l wanted a body.
They'll do research on a body
in the hospital, isn't it?- ls it?
l want a young one, not an
over ripe one, okay?
Come on...l need some photographs.
Brother, l've got a body.
lmported one.- lmported means?
Made in Japan.
Let it be anything.
lt shouldn't be smelly.
Japanese don't have a nose.
Then, how'll they smell?
They don't have a nose,
but l have, right?
You take lndians photo?- Yeah.
Come with me. We'll photographs
this poor lndia.
Come...
See poor lndia.
No house. All stay inside the sacks.
You want to take photo?- Yes.
Wait.
You go inside his house.
Go inside the sack, then take photos.
Hey hold him tightly trap him.
Hey go man...
Hey come.
Collection king,
l've brought a body.
Recent body.- ls it? Really.
Look, our personal body has come.
He is very heavy.
Dead body will be heavy.
Look at the body. He coughs...
Oh god! What's this?
Hey you cheat...
Stop...Stop everybody.
l need poor lndia photograph.
Sir, how many times do
l've to tell you?
l'm not at fault.
l did what they told me.
Did you tell me or not?
l said, all of them
are covering the body.
He asked me to
bring a personal body.
l brought the body
in order to learn.
Good, l appreciate
your interest on learning.
l'll teach you. Please come.
This way.
Lungs, heart and chest...
- Then Kidney, Operate them.
Operate?- Do it.
Not like that.
This is an operation.
You should hold it like a
pencil and do it smoothly.
Admit him.
After he gets consciousness, tell him
that l had filled up his form.- Okay sir.
l came to the class without
having breakfast.
l didn't sleep last night.
They had washed the mosaic floor.
l slipped and fell down.
l thought of taking rest here. What is it?
Why all are laughing?
Am l lying?
Why are you laughing?
Who are you? l've seen you some where.
Why're you digging the past?
ls it you?
Do you remember him?
l got it. 'Operation'...
Have you become alright?
- Now l'm alright.
What're you talking man?
l'll become alright some day.- ls it?
How're you now? - l'm not a patient.
How are you?- l'm fine.
What about your son?
What do you want me to say?
Stupid son. He again took
phenol in the hospital.
Hey how many times you'll vomit?
First, you shouldn't beat young men.
lf they fail in their exams,
they will take foildol.
Are we not humans?
Hey, don't beat him. His phenol
may come out.
Move away.
Brother, the mouth isn't the place
for this to be poured in.
When you breathe, you'll get
that smell. Can you sleep peacefully?
lf someone mistakes you
for a toilet, then what?
Who knows my hardship?
You're talking philosophy in anger.
Love failure?
What love?
Wait, in your days
you had no such facility.
You married as per
your father's wish.
He loved a girl, right?
This is...
She will come in his dreams.
He'll smile at her.
But who will come in her dreams?
You've turned a happy
song into a sad one.
What is one side love?
Are you crying for that?
Okay cry, if you don't
cry, who will cry for you?
lf you practice crying,
You should cry for others also.
You'll think like that.
Do you know about
'Embrace Therapy'?- No.- Don't know?
Come here.
This is that.
A   B I T T E R K R A B   R I P
Listen to 'Alwarpet
wise man's sayings'.
There is no one side love.
Why do you want to die
after your love failure?
Can't you love another person?
lf not 'Dhavani' there will be 'salwar'.
Buddy, fall in love.
lf a doctor's daughter
rejects your love, love a nurse.
lt is justified here.
''Alwarpet''...
Oh Alwarpet wise man,
shall l cross the 'dhoti'?
There is no one side love.
At the age of 1 2, butterflies
will fly in your heart.
That isn't called love.
When you talk by looking at the eyes,
lt may wonder below the neck.
That isn't called love.
when you lie down on the torn mat,
and dream about
'Cleopatra' it's not love.
When you see Mannequin,
if you hear 'gikku' sound
in your heart, then that isn't love.
Atlast, you should give up your life.
You should be understanding.
Love isn't god.
All this is the result
of hormone revolt.
Oh Alwarpet wise man,
shall l cross the 'dhothi'?
There's no one side love.
Why do you want to die
after your love failure?
Why can't you love another person?
lf not 'Dhavani'
there will be a 'salwar'.
Beat the drums.
Come on nurse.
Hey...
Oh god.
Love is the first
failure for human beings.
One gets good experience.
Love feels proud because
of the failure of first love.
Said so the poets.
lf those who fail in love die, then
there will be no one to caste votes.
lf one & two escape, their love
will fructify in the third round.
Oh nol Why are you crying for this?
Why are you escaping from your life?
Love is like sea.
Forgetting that, why're you
swimming inside a tumbler?
Alwarpet wise man,
shall l cross the 'dhothi'?
There's no one side love.
Why do you want to die?
Why can't you love another person.
lf not 'Thavani'
there will be a 'Salwar'.
lf a doctor rejects your love, love a nurse.
lt is justified here.
Alwarpet wise man,
shall l cross the 'dhothi'?
Fall in love.
lf not 'Thavani'
there will be a 'Salwar'.
Fall in love.
Hello, congrats. - What?
Congrats?- Why? For that song?
How was my dance?
Did you like the lyrics?
lt's not for that. l'm thanking you
for that suicide case.
Suicide? ls this a police station.
He has a name.
- Sorry Nelakandan.
l saw a smile on his face.
- lt will be there only.
l'm sure he's going to be alright.
That's why, l came to
shake hands with you.
You had already done it, it's alright.
But it seems you've come
here with a plan.
l don't think you've
come here to study.
No l haven't come to study.
l've come to teach a lesson,
to Dean and his daughter.
Look, don't include Pappu in your
crusade unnecessarily.
Why're you getting tensed?
That day l had asked you to
assume that you're Pappu.
But now you're talking to me
as real Pappu?
Why're you concerned about her?
Listen, Pappu isn't wrong.
lnfact she doesn't know anything.
My neck is paining.
You please come this side.
Pappu and l are close friends.
Closer than me?
Are you very close to her?
Have you seen Pappu with
her inner garments?- What?
l've seen her.
- Shit, where and when?
ln my young age
when she was a baby.
She was very beautiful.
Now she would've grown up
and hidden all her beauty.
Now how does she look now?
You don't even known how she looks.
And you're casting aspersions on her.
Actually Pappu hadn't
complained about you to the Dean.
lt was her servant maid.
Why Dean should believe
that servant maid's words?
Madam leave aside Pappu's matter.
Tell me how does that servant
maid look.- Why?
l think Dean has something
to do with the maid.
lmmediately you make
arrangements to meet Pappu.
Oh god! Dean will not spare her.
Okay, you study well
without disturbing anyone,
l'll see that you and Pappu meet.
- Promise?- Promise.
Have a look at this case.
This is an interesting case.
This case is a rare
phenomenon in medical history.
For the past 12 years,
this has remained like this only.
This can't talk, hear or feel anything.
lts feelings are dead.
But subject is still alive.
Now look at me carefully.
When l beam the torch light,
pupil will have movement.
But eyelids won't close.
Master, it's enough. Switch off
the torch. His eyes may be dazzled.
Subject can't feel anything.
ls this history or geography subjects?
You're calling him as a subject!
Doesn't he have a name?
What's his a name?
Good, just now you're
looking at his name?
What is his name?
Case name is Anand.- Don't call
him a case. Call him Mr.Anand.
What's wrong in that?
lf we give respect, will it know?
From the beginning l'm watching you,
you're talking against me.
Am l a student or you?
Raja, keep quiet.
Why're you getting emotional now?
lf l don't get emotional,
you may call me also a subject,
and start showing torch light
in my eyes.
Okay, l personally feel,
that medication isn't necessary
for the survival of such persons. - Why?
You know that very well,
we don't have adequate medical facilities
or hospitals in our country.
ls it necessary for him to occupy
the same bed for the past 12 years without hope?
What is the use?
He is useful for the study of this class.
ls it not a use?
One question sir.
Do you want me to ask 5 questions?
Sir, questions no: 2
How can you be sure that this person
can't get up from his seat?
l'm a doctor.
- Just a doctor, not god.
The one who doesn't know to
respect his fellow human being,
can't be a human, doctor or even god.
Sambu, don't you know
''love is Vishnu''.
ls it not ''love is Shivam''?
We had said it already, right?
l just tried a new expression.
Rajaraman, will you please get out?
- Oh really?
Then 3rd question for you.
When l leave the class, can l take
Mr.Anand along with me?- No way.
Then answer my 2th question.
What'll you do, if l take him
without your permission?- Shit.
He had given a right
answer for this alone.
You carry on with that.
l'll go for a walk.- No.
l'll ask you the 5th question later.
Raja, what're you doing?
- Move away...
Mr.Anand, don't worry.
Doctors consider themselves god.
You don't believe them.
You can believe an atheist.
You can even believe a theist.
But don't believe those who
consider themselves as god.
You will be ruined.
lf anyone troubles you, tell me.
Oh you can't say, right?
You just think.
l'll read your mind.
Good persons can read minds.
Do you know?
Hey...Anand...
When l was bringing you,
should this have happened?
Madam, give me.
- Hey, what're you doing?
l'm checking whether
he's alive.
When l was bringing him,
his head fell.
Okay madam, everything
is functioning well.
lt should.
Okay, Mr.Anand, do you want
to hear your heart beat?
Oh god! l couldn't see his ear.
- He can hear and see.
lt seems she is a Tamil
teacher giving a lecture.
1 , 2, 3 mike testing...
Can you hear?
How is your heart?
You are 100% alive.
No 200% adding my age to it.
Till l'm here, you'll not face
any problem. You'll be healthy.
No one can...what's this, it got stuck.
Have it...- lt's okay.
Wait for 5 minutes.
Hello, Vatti....
He took the subject out of the class.
He twisted Dr.Kalidhas's hand,
without even filling the admission form,
he made him to admit a suicide case.
He went on leave, getting scared.
What is this Margabandhu?
- How do l Know sir?
You've an answer for everything.
''How do l know''.
But you're right. How do you know?
Sir, forget it. He's using
lot of bad words.
Rascal, rogue, scoundrel...
- What else?- Wastrel...
Yes sir.
Hey move away....
move...give way.
Sir, we should first dismiss him.
Just a minute.
That won't be possible.
That is wrong.
Why?- What why?
What is your reason?
ls it because he's asking you questions?
Or talking vulgarly?
He has come first
in the entrance exam.
You should have a strong
reason to dismiss him.
Yes, l've got an idea.
Margabandhu, prepare a
tough question paper.
l'll set questions from ancient
Tamil poems. Definitely he'll fail.
l'm serious. l'm not joking.
Prepare a question paper in such
a way that no one should answer it.
He can't answer. He will fail.
l'll dismiss him the next minute.
- Great idea.
Leader, collection king's men are
bringing a cot, what to do?
What language are you talking?
Sorry sir, collection king's men
are bringing a cot,
where can l place it?
Don't keep the head closer.
He may look like having 3 heads.
Move aside...
What have you in your mind?
l think a lot in my mind.
l'm going to become a doctor, right?
What do you want? Tell me.
You're violating hospital rules.
Please translate it in Tamil.
Look, l can hand you over
to the police now.
Look, my father-in-law is
sending me to jail.
Okay Rajaram, listen...
Why've you bought this
cot and bed here?
He is the reason for that.
He said that l can't
provide him bed.
l got this bed in auction.
Mr.Anand don't worry. You can lie
down here for as many days as you wish.
You just enjoy man.
Take photo.
Did you take his smiling face?
Oh no! l missed him.
Okay, hereafter he'll be
smiling throughout the day.
Hey, be careful. He hasn't cut
his hair for the past 10 years.
Don't be careless
since he is in comma.
Anand don't get scared.
l'll cut your hair carefully
and make you the hero.
Daily l'll take you for a walk.
lf you see the sun light
you'll become alright.
Do you hear me?
- Haven't you heard the song?
''Mother who embraces
with her 1000 hands'',
''l offer my salutations''.
We've lots of vitamins in that.
ls it 'B'? - No, 'T'.
You useless fellow, go man.
- You're calling him like that.
But one person is saying
that you're a useless fellow.
Who is he?
- Sulam Zamamani.
He's saying ''if you want to
collect money, come to me''.
''There no use of depending
on collection king''.
''He has gone to college''.
He has trapped all our
bank customers.- ls it?
Yes brother, let's go.
Why're you stopping
your work half way?
Do it man.
Let him be good.
We've come to study
concentrate on studies.
Can we do both the jobs together?
Oh no!- why're you getting upset?
ls it so easy to become a doctor?
Do you know how many bones
are there in our body?
216 bones.
You know only to break them.
Have we ever counted them?
What's it brother?
We have counted them many times.
l didn't mean that.
l mean have we ever
thought like wise men?
Nowadays, he's talking
too much.- What?
l mean to say that
he has long hair.
That's why l had asked him to cut it.
You've heard about students
bunking their classes.
Have you heard of a master
misbehaving with students?
Dean always misbehaves with me.
Give respect to him.
- Why should he be respected?
You should respect everyone.
Can l tell you one thing?- Tell me.
Everyone in our management dislikes you.
- You too?
Brother.
You come and have a look.
l'm talking to you...Raja...
Wow! Anand.
You had hidden your beautiful face
for such a long time.
lf nurses see you, they'll say
''Hereafter don't call me sister''.
''our hearts may break''.
- Lets go for a walk.
Look at him nicely.
Sister have you seen him?
He looks smart.
Did you see him?
- lt's all fine?
But that Dean and his friends
have set a tough question paper.
They're planning to sack you.
lf you pass in this examination,
l'll definitely take you to Pappu.
Look l'm tensed about
my meeting with Pappu.
But not to pass.
He knows Siddarath.
He knows the tricks.
He knows to read pulses.
He knows to count crores.
He's a versatile doctor.
Are you upset?- No? Why?
You're worried...
after seeing the paper.
Yes sir, did you see the paper?
ln vanthavasi, 7 from same family
are hacked in clash among them.
But Kuppama adjusted
it in Kanchepuram.
She gave birth to 7
children in her 1st delivery.
What can you understand from this?
You can defeat god and population.
What're you looking at?
Haven't you seen the paper?
Only English paper?
Why're you talking about Hindu etc.
Are you in the examination hall,
or in the tea stall?
Hey keep quiet man.
What should l tick for the 5th question?
You should tick...hey...5C.
Okay next...
6 orders of god. 6B?
That's all. Over. You fold the paper.
- Thank you.
Have you finished?- Yes.
So quick?
- Yes, l'll give it to you.
lt's a tough paper.
That's why l asked.
Educated people will
be respected everywhere.
lf rowdies become doctors,
then think about the atmosphere
of the hospital.
How will they talk?
''You do post mortem on that bastard''.
''That scoundrel is out of danger''.
''Buddy, you'll die''.
How nice to hear all these words!
l know about suitcases,
what is this broken case?
Sir, it may be a
suitcase with a lock.
Hey keep quiet man.
Didn't l ask you to prepare
a tough question paper?
l prepared it.
- Then how can he get 95.5%
lf l block a coin,
he's some how pocketing that coin.
Sir don't talk about carrom.
Okay how can he get a top score?
How do l know that sir?
- l'm sorry. How would you know?
May l come in sir?
Sir, you asked me to
call Rajaram, he's...
We'll deal with the matter.
l'm the Dean, l'm standing.
Yes, lt seems you'll
get vericose veins.
Just now your men
taught me this.
Don't stand for a
long time, sit down.
Are you teaching me?
You're sitting without giving respect?
What's this bad habit?
You had only taught me.
ln the classroom you're teaching us
standing. l'm your follower.
Talking logic!
But there's no logic in your
marks which you've scored.
You've done something.
l know that very well.
l'll definitely find out.
- Why do you take the trouble?
l'll tell you openly.
l cheated and passed in the exam.
l'll continue it even in future.
This is the situation today.
Shut up!
Hey why're you laughing
like a mad man?
Whom are you calling
''A mad man''?
l told all of us.
l too laughed.
We've become close now, right?
- Shut up.
No one has ever talked
like this to me.
Mammu, there's should be
a beginning for everything.
What is this Mammu?
- l'll tell you the meaning.
My name is Raja.
l can be called 'Raju'.
So, father-in-law can be
called 'Mammu'.
That's all.
Cool down.
What? - l thought you had called me.
You don't know about me.
lf l want l can throw
you out of the college.
Do you remember the day
l drove you out of my house?
l can't forget that day...
l saw my father shedding tears.
l have never seen him crying.
Even when my grand father died,
he didn't cry & stood like a rock.
By your single revelation,
he started shedding tears.
l've to become a doctor,
and put a rivet on you.
My rivet, rivet then nails.
You can leaver them out.
Next l should marry
your daughter Pappu.
You laugh...
Next l should arrange
your pyre.
Sorry l've said it in a
local language.
l'll arrange for a stretcher for you.
l know what you're going to say.
You'll say 'get out'.
lf l go out by your order,
that will be an insult for me.
l've some work. l'll take leave.
You keep on smiling.
l've an urgent work.
Ask me 'what's it'?
Won't you ask me?
l will tell you.
Congrats...you've got a promotion.
How did you get the
phone call from my office?
l meant, you're going
to become a father.
How does my office know it?
Always office...hug your
wife and be happy man.
Not here, at home.
When did you come?
l came while you were
congratulating him.
Wish me too.
You too? Get lost.
No...?
You said pregnant women
will get 'Pappa' (baby)
You said if l pass,
Pappu will come to meet me.
l don't get you.
Why're you walking away?
- l have work.
You said that you'll help me
meet Pappu if l pass.
Pappu is ready to meet you.
But when l think of her father...
What's that Laugh theraphy
for reducing tension?
Can one get sound sleep
if he yawns?
Even l've not completed
my doctor's degree,
l can prescribe
correctly for few cases.
Laughing theraphy will
not work for him.
Embracing theraphy will.
Ask Pappu to embrace
her father fondly daily.
Wait and see. His tension
will definitely reduce.
That's embracing theraphy.
- Embracing theraphy?
Won't they say that
hands that beat will also hug?
Ask me about rowdism?
l've spent half of my
life in rowdism.
Now l regret it.
lf we clasp hands with
the hitter and hug him,
relations will become cordial.
That's embracing theraphy.
Can't they move away
seeing me swabbing?
He's always like that.
Look how you're laughing
without tension.
lf you were angry l would've given you
embracing theraphy,
and Pappu would've felt jealous,
and there is something which
comes between lovers, what's it?
Villain?- No...
After getting very close
to each other..- Baby?
Oh god you...that's
a jolly tension.
Love?.- Yes, that's it.
Hey, do you take yourself
to be lord Krishna.
l'm swabbing the floor & you're
walking on itleaving your foot marks.
l'm going on an important work.
Nobody has brains.
Why's he getting
tensed at this age?
Wait for 5 minutes.
l'm swabbing...l'm telling them
not to dirty the floor.
Do l've to tell you specially?
Why're you troubling me like this?
You'll walk away leaving your foot marks.
Higher officials will shout at me
saying that l didn't swab it clean.
Your name?- Why? Going to complain
against me? Do it?
l'm Punniakodi.
The result of your work
is in your name, you know?
What do you mean?
DEED.
Doctors treat diseases, taking money.
But you're preventing the diseases by
swabbing the floor with Phenol.
That's service.
l'm doing that for 20 Yrs.
- That's different.
What l mean is...Social service, like the
freedom fighters did to the nation.
Me?- Then?
Bigwigs don't find time
to appreciate all this.
We've to find some time to appreciate.
There will no Cholera outbreak if there's
a person like you in every street?
But you talk too much! You'll
shout at everything.
Yet you've a good heart.
There may be many people outside.
With perfumed bodies &
a nasty heart inside.
You should be happy...
don't lament, okay?
Hey, leave me... let me do my work.
Anything wrong with you?
l'm very fine!
That's my problem.
Did you take me to be mad?
l'm not.
l'm always like this.
Oh god!- What happened?
Atlast l've stamped it.
Stamp wherever you like.
l'll clean it.
What?- l've to go.
Go...You've lot of work to attend.
l've only this work.
That's it.
Pappu, you know what's this?
Sweet lime! No...collection Raja!
l'm going to squeeze out his juice now.
Dad, why're you talking like
a film villain?
Are you the dean or don?
You don't know.
A famous rowdy Thangavelu consulted
me for hernia operation.
He'll do whatever l tell him to.
He's like sathukuddy(sweet like) now.
Sweet like?- ln Tuttokuddy.
l'll call him and make Raja...
Dad, l'm fear,
that Raja will become dean and.,..
You'll get involved in rowdism and
become collection Viswanath.
Relax dad, cool!- Don't worry.
O phone! Attend the phone.
Hello!- Hello! Pappy l'm Raja.
Tell me Raja.
Did your friend Janaki tell you
what l said?
Why's he calling you here?
About what
- Embracing therapy.
Did you embrace your father?
What does father-in-law say?
- He's calling me father-in-law!
lf he acts too smart, tell me.
One of my friend is there in Tuttukuddy.
His name is Thangavel.
lf l tell him...- Raja why all this now?
''lf l pass the exam'',
Janaki said, ''l can meet you''.
What do you say?
Yes, what day is tomorrow?
Saturday, right?
Okay tomorrow at 10'O'clock
at hotel Le Meridian..
...at Disco hall! See you, bye.
What's this?
Disco?
What work does she have here?
Hi Raja.
Me?
Brother, she's there!- Where?
She's the one!
She's coming floating.
You're looking so handsome.
What're you looking at?
Can't you recognise me?
l can.- l'm your Pappu.
Greetings sister, l'm Vatti!
- What ''Jetty''!- Oh god!
You've come here correctly as l said!
ls it?- Hi Pappu!- Hi!
Hey beat him.- Hey wait!
lf each tackle ten we can
finish them all.
Why're you also troubling me?
l'm already vexed!
Come sweety!- Sweety?
Who's he?
My boy friend!- Boy friend means?
Means a rehearsal before marriage.
Rehearsal?- Yes.
Come on, life is short! Let's enjoy.
Enjoy is a bad word.
Don't use it.
Okay, are you free on coming Saturday.
- Why?
My boy friend is going abroad.
Let's both have rehearsal!
lf rehearsal is okay, then
let's marry.
Pappu, you weren't like l saw
you in your childhood.
You've changed a lot.- Ofcourse. l know.
What does lf mean?- Very necessary.
What?- Somebody is calling you there...
Pppu, you've changed a lot!
He must've been shocked!
Shocked? He was put off completely.
Dad...
So nice! Say it once again.
Pappu, you've changed a lot.
- O so sweet!
Are you happy now father?
l'm very happy.
- lt's a sin to hurt other's feelings.
l also say the same thing,
shouldn't hurt others feelings.
But he had hurt my feelings.
Oh god, when Pappu was a child,
her skirt wouldn't stay on her waist.
being a child, we could forgive her.
lt's unjust if she's the same
at this age also.
lf the skirt goes below the waist,
lt'll be called socks
and not skirt.
Dressing up this way is the fashion.
What a scandalous fashion?
This is ration! Can't she be little
bit liberal with her clothing?
Oh god! You've to see her dance.
Those who were ignorant of it,
would've immediately given the keys.
lt was like fits!
Why're you getting so angry?- Then?
lf he's a doctor? By his looks
we believe he's.
You look like a doctor.
lmmediately we'll feel like
greeting you.
She never creates that confidence.
She's something strange..
You can't change her now... forget her...
That Dean also!
None of them are benefited by
this challenge.
What?- No, l'm worried.
You suggest good ideas.
What?- Feelings.
You carry on with your writing.
l'll say whatever l like.
Pappu is nor wrong.
Can't blame her mother too.
That was his mistake... He..
Who?- That Dean!
look, why're you calling him disrespectfully.
This's called good rearing!
You feel like respecting others, right?
That comes out from
the way you're reared.
lf he had reared her up properly,
my Pappu would've been like you now.
Then would l've been lamenting
to you now.
l would've been talking to her.
Look, l'm not your Pappu...- l know.
You carry on...
W W W . T M S T O R R E N T S . C O M
Forest is laid open.
Wind is swaying the flowers.
Eyes are laid open.
Love is killing lives.
Agony of love in heartl
A Hurricane in the flower.
A word which came out from my heart,
got choked in my throat.
My body hasn't parted away from you.
My legs got rooted.
l'm the dew drop of the earthl
Oh sunl Take me offl
l'm burning for ages.
Oh dew drop, extinguish mel
O bondage... O life...
O feelings...
Agony of love in heartl
A Hurricane in the flower.
Forest is laid open.
Wind is swaying the flowers.
Eyes are laid open.
Love is killing lives.
Agony of love in heartl
A Hurricane in the flower.
Not only you're the patient, me too.
Love patient...
l Love Janaki..
But one sided love.
She's not aware of it!
No use of one sided love.
She should hear what l say.
My love should fall on her ears.
Since morning l indulge in such couplets.
Vatti gave me coffee...
l said ''if you stir, its coffee''
Look, how the poems are
flowing out from me.
Poet Kannadasan has said,
You've to say whatever l wish to say.
lt's right, isn't it?
Even if you're not able to say,
like they say ''Silence is
the indication of acceptance..''
You're gesturing through
your eyes, that's...
What?
l was about to say,
l'm not able to..
He's showing his eyes!
yes, He shows his eyes
and we're beaming the torch.
Not that! He winked at me!
He signaled me!
Signal?- You come and see please.
Show your eyes!
Anand sir, wink your eyes, please.
Forest is laid open!
There's a different song for him!
You've to say whatever l wish to say.
lf you stir, its coffee.
All of your attend to your work!
Sir, he will signal now.
- You wait for it, we'll do our work.
He really did like this...- With his fingers?
You're also joking!
He winked at me with his eyes!
Raja, please understand.
He can't hear you!
Even if your voice reaches his ears,
lt can't reach his brain.
- Why?
Rumors will go only upto the ear.
lt we talk about love,
it will reach the brain.
Look, l'll tell you one thing.
Suppose one has heart to heart
feelings with another,
if one thinks, it'll reach the other.
l...
Janaki, l love you...
Got the signal! But she
can't hear me.
Let me go out and try like
a mobile phone.
Hi uncle...Haven't your
laughing therapy over yet?
That's why l'm hale and healthy.
By the by, Janaki, l forgot to tell you,
On the way l met Ramamohan's son.
Very handsome! Neuro surgeon.
He's a real doctor!
Let's seek your alliance with him.
l'll get it!
What?
What's it daddy?
Raja, how come you're here!
- Hold this.
l should ask that question.
Have you come to see Pappu.- Yeah! yes!
Why're you here?
Oh god! Ruined...!
Who?- Me!
This's the bouquet of compromise.
Please come this side, l'll tell you.
Ask me what Poo(flower) is this?
- ManniPoo(forgiveness).
lt's joke... Take it smilingly!
Please sit down.
- You please...
l've given you lot of tension.
Don't take it to heart!
- lt's okay!
l want to tell you something.
l don't know how to tell this to a father.
- lt's okay, tell me.
Your daughter Pappu is little...very bad.
What to do? lt's my fate!
Okay, l've decided one thing
after seeing you in tension.
l'll nullify my challenge.
- Good.
l knew this before itself.
Pappu and you will not suit each other.
Her moral background is not right.
What?- Background, you know, right?
No sir, her background is beautiful...
l didn't mean that background...
Pappu is a total waste.
You've calling your own daughter
a waste.- l've no other choice.
So, hereafter you'll not
come to the hospital.
l'll not, but l may come.. - Why?
First l stepped in it with clash as motive,
now l think l've to step in for love.
What do you mean?
Between a lady and me... a feeling.
You mean, you're in love.
lt's the same in all languages.
l thought you were a big rowdy,
dampness in the stone.
No, it's my sweat.
- Joke!
Who's that lucky girl?
That's....- Look at the shyness.
Not there...over here.
Why should l feel shy?
l'll show you.
Where?
That's Pappu!
l don't mean her
but next to her is my girl.
Haven't brushed your teeth?
Driving scooter?
Cough? Shall l get water?
Are you asking me to go?
Asking me not to come?
Good morning.
l wished you but you didn't bother to...
Angry with me?- Then?
All of them saw me wishing you
and you didn't bother to...
l feel ashamed...
Did you tell Pappu's father that
you would marry me?
Oh! That's why you're angry.
But it's uncivil of you
not to wish me back.
Oh god! Good morning.
Good morning! You look good
even when you're angry.
Look, l've forgotten everything.
Please turn this side.
Even my topic got changed, when you
saw me like that.- Tell me.
l talk Tamil fluently but...
...l'm not able to find a word
which l want to..
l've got it!
Feelings!
l've some feelings for you...
Do you've the same?
No...
No?
l am a one sided feeler then?
lt's my fate, leave me.
Wait!
l like you a lot!You're a
very good person.- Thanks!
No, l meant, in a different way.
You can make anybody happy.
Anybody?
Mother, father...
- Oh, you're going on that route...
Brothers... - Where?
After telling all the relations,
and finally telling about our relation here.
Oh, is this spot not good?
You're walking searching for
the spots but not replying.
Say yes or no!
Even if it's 'no', say 'Yes'.
What's wrong in it.
Good morning doctor.
Thank heavens! She didn't
wish you back also.
l thought l was the only sucker.
l think she doesn't have the
habit of wishing 'Good morning'.
Look here... One minute.
Whatever may be the result, tell me
but no suspense.
l'll not be able to bear it.
Raja, please.
Asking me to sit here? Okay!
you finish your talk,
then we'll talk.
Your reports have come.
One minute.
You told me ''feelings''..
What did you mean?
l feel a butterfly flying
in my stomach.
Do you feel the pain?
Butterfly in the stomach
and pain is here.
For how long?- For the past few days.
ls it?- What's wrong with you?
A butterfly in the stomach.
But pain is there...
...and not here.
You're very lucky, both in
the same spot! For me...
Raja, will you be quiet?
l want to talk to him personally.
Oh medical? We'll talk later.
Then we'll talk.
Tell me doctor.
Can somebody come from your home?
Why? What happened?
You should've come little early.
Hereafter, you shouldn't lose hope.
You've stomach cancer.
you've to get admitted immediately.
Doctor, l've to finish
my duties.
Okay, finish everything &
get admitted in the after noon.
Afternoon means...
half a day is my time.
Right?- l didn't mean that.
l've to buy a house...
l've to send my mother
on pilgrimage to Haj.
l've to get my sister married.
l've to settle down in life.
Will you give me only
half-a-day for all this?
According to what you say,
l think, god has given only
half-a-day more to my life.
Okay doctor, see you.
Why it's happening only to me?
l haven't smoked or drank...
l've not touched even a woman...
My friends do drink,
roam with women,
l also wanted that type of life.
l thought of starting my life
after finishing my duties.
Now l think my life
will end before that.
How long will he be alive...?
lf god permits...
Have you studied about
god or medicine?
l'm asking you,
how long will be survive?
For a little more time. lt's very difficult
to say but after treatment...
Why treat him at all?
you say that he'll not survive...
ls it to bring revenue
to the hospital?
You'll ask him to do many tests
and bill him heavyly.
l din't know all this earlier,
but now l've seen it.
That's what doctors do.
Sorry, what to do?
Will the keeper of a funeral ghat
know the grief of one crying there?
Why did you tell him?
lf it was me, l wouldn't have told him.
ls he studying medicine?
You're telling him about the diseases.
You could've sent him away saying
that he has only stomach ache,
go home, have liquor & enjoy
with women.
What are you saying?
- l'm talking about the facts of life.
ls studying medicine for it necessary?
You say he has no chances.
He only needs persons
to care for him now.
He needs only my embracing therapy.
Wait...- Leave me sir.
l've go home and cry.
l'll be disgraced
in front of everybody.
Listen to me please.
Don't think god has given
you only half a days's time.
Think that he has given me.
l'll get your sister married.
l'll send your mother on
pilgrimage and look after her.
Hey, who're you to
look after my mother?
How are you qualified to know?
You're going to live you

But l...l'm going to die.
Listen to me. All of us
are going to die.
l'm also going to die.
Life is to enjoy.
Look, my mother has
taught me a therapy.
That's embracing therapy.
Hey go away...go away.
You'll not understand all this.
Hey Zakir...listen to me.
Nothing sister, it's my fault.
Where does a person go after death?
My father often says,
''They'll turn into stars.''
Look there. The one big
bright star is father.
Next to it is uncle.
Next to it is...
Brother, l saw my
big uncle yesterday.
Oh god! Population has
increased in Tamil Nadu.
lf it increases here, then naturally
there will be a increase there also.
Let's decrease our
population in the hostel.
Pack all our baggage and leave.
You've hidden something in your mind,
tell me what's it?
You'll not believe
if l tell you.
One person had hit me.
You? Tell me who's he?
We'll prove ourselves to him.
Hey, switch on the light.
Where's Zakir's bed?
Where's Zakir's bed? Come.
Hey...You're Zakir,
aren't you?- Yes.
Did you hit my brother?
- Who is your brother?
Asking who...?
l didn't hit anybody.
My brother had asked me to show
you a more important thing than death.
A   B I T T E R K R A B   R I P
Sina Thana came laughing.
and went after a flirt
who came on her own.
She shed honey,
and disappeared
after the break of dawn.
Sina Thana came laughing and went
after a flirt who came on her own.
O sister...O sister...
Sina Thana came laughing and went
after a flirt who came on her own.
She shed honey.
and disappeared after
the break of dawn.
lt's my body. Ask me once
when it'll blush out of shyness?
Do you want to know the
meaning for meaningless words?
This is the school for that.
despite of the fences,
his legs will be eager to cross
if one sees the beauty.
Even if humans have come from monkeys,
Still they have tails.
There's no algae in
the running water.
No diseases when you
extricate your emotions.
Gemini is the movie
taken to enjoy life.
l'm going to show
that only to you.
Sina Thana came laughing and went
after a flirt who came on her own.
She shed honey.
and disappeared after
the break of dawn.
Raja brother had asked me to make you
happy no matter whatever l've to do.
l was afraid when they dragged me.
So instead of doing your duty,
you're coming after enjoying
with them and with a girl.
To take required medicines
for Zakir...- Shut up.
Hereafter l'll not stay quiet.
Let me see whether its him or me.
Leave them.
Sir, don't get angry.
They did it for me.
lt is my fault.
You needn't give me any punishment,
God has already fixed my death.
Sir, treat this as my last wish,
don't do anything to them please.
Hey, l've a severe head ache.
Hey, there's an embracing threapy
for it. Come on embrace.
Nimmi, l also have headache,
embrace me too.- Hey get lost.
Do you know whom Raja embraced
first in this hospital?- Who.
Me only.
There's some power in
his embracing threapy.
Hey take it fast.
l felt that you said something.
i didn't say anything.
How you'll say?
lt'll work out only
where there's feelings.
While someone going out
they'll ask, ''where're you going''?
They say, shouldn't ask such a
question or say, ''lts okay, tell me.''
Where're such feelings here?
This is a hospital?
Patient calls doctor ''god''
Calls nurse sister.
But you call them by numbers.
You sweep the patients
away like rubbish.
There's no good hearted person here,
that's why l'm quitting.
Please understand.
You've to be in this hospital.
Why should l be
where l'm uninvited?
l expressed my feelings to
Pappu but she returned to me.
This dean is disrespecting us.
l thought of expressing
those feelings to you,
You didn't reciprocate
so l'm leaving.
Okay, l've.- What?
Feelings.
Unload all the things and
keep them back in my room.
Brother why're you turning the
tables like this?
We spent 1 and 1/2 hour
to load all this.
She accepted that
she has feelings for me.
Hey unload all the things.
We can load and unload
1 0 times for it.
Thank you madam.
Brother, she has gone.
ls she walking away in a huff?
No...she kept her hand like this.
Do you mean to say
that's not shyness?
Why're you telling all this to me?
Go and catch her,
she may go away.
Hey, unload the things fast.
Oh god. l thought that you had left...
Dean has called you immediately.
Leave my hand, follow me.
Oh god, this is attention. Yuck.
- Wait...sister, you go...
Only we've to adjust, since
she has got some feelings for me.
Let both of us follow...come
- Why is he talking like this?
Father-in-law, did you call me?
Hereafter, you aren't my
father-in-law everything is over.
This isn't a hotel
but a hospital.- Yes.
Discipline is important
here and not disco.
Oh, are you talking about Zakir.
He's counting his days
how to discipline him?
We can live with discipline.
But how to die with discipline?
Do it and show. My work will be over.
l've made him laugh.
lnstead of being happy,
you're getting angry.
So you agree that you're solely
responsible for all this.
Why only yes. l even feel proud.
Which is proud, one dying
with laughter..
Or one like you making other's
die by laughter?- That is it.
This is your dismissal order.
Get out with your baggage.
Me?- Yes.
Too late.
l was about to quit.
But when my lover
stopped me,
l also decided not to.
l've promised her in my heart
She is not aware of it.
l'll not go even
if you chase me out.
l'll throw you out with
the help of the police.
When police couldn't put me in
how'll they throw me out?
Are you going to dial the number?
Do you atleast know the
name of the local inspector?
lt'll go to the control room.
lt seems he's going to give me exit.
l'm the one who give
entry.
Oh god, did you think that
l did it wantonly.
Will anybody do it wantonly?
But l will, that's my
style...see you?
Sorry.
Sister, when is the doctor
going to discharge me?
Somebody fill up the
admission form for me.
Raja, what happened?
- Come...come....
Nothing, just 2 bottles...
Did you drink liquor
- No, l broke them.
One on my hand, other one on
my head and on my forehead.
Then on my neck...- Spine...
lt seem there was a
confusion about it.- No compression.
Okay, let it be anything.
So sad, this poor fellow,
got frightened after seeing me,
he had climbed down the
stairs on his hands.
Already his legs are gone.
Hey duck...
Ask his name?- What?
ln Tamil, it's Donald duck.
Why did you do like this?
Look here, very nice.
There's a saying, ''Rocking the
cradle and pinching the baby''.
You stopped me from going saying
that you've the feeling of love for me.
But they told me to leave.
So, l immediately
decided what to do,
and planned this drama
and got admitted.
Do you know, what's my tension?
lt was okay, if it was a
charitable hospital.
They're more cunning than me.
l'm tensed whether they'll
bill me heavily.
lf he was my father-in-law,
it was okay to pay.
Now he's not!
That's what l'm thinking.
What's going on here actually?
Okay, can you get it clearly?
l would've broken his
limbs in anger.
Why do we've to? Already
they're broken into pieces.
Nothing doing. Make him alright
and discharge him immediately.
Then, we've to use fevicol to stick
them and discharge him.
Joking?
Sorry!- l don't know
what you'll do!
l want him out of this
hospital within a week.
Yes sir.
Oh god!
Excuse me! Way please.
Do you know a good thing in him?
He remains the same in
victory or defeat.
That's said in every Philosophy.
Look, how calm he's..
and he's a calm patient, they call
him a coma patient, sinners.
Hey Raja, look there.
ls he winking his eyes,
leave that.
He'll wink only at us like a heroine.
When l bring somebody to
prove it, he'll ditch me.
Leave that. You tell me,
are you free today?
What does it mean?
As per the doctor, l'll be
free only for few days.
Then you can't catch me.
l'll fly away!
Hey, don't talk about this
grief Philosophy to me.
l'm collection Raja!
Who can take you away
when l'm here.
Who can?- God of demon can!
No dearth of jokes with you.
l feel like crying when you crack jokes.
Don't put me off.
l've 2 tickets for the night show.
Are you going?- 2 tickets? with whom?
Without asking about the movie,
You're asking with whom?
That's somebody else.
a friend who insists in watching
movie with you.
Who's that?
Sorry, who's that? Tell me.
Sina Thana came laughing..
Play the tune man,
went after a flirt who came on her own.
Look he's winking.
Father.. - Slowly.
Sir, please sir!
Will my father recover?
How do l know?
Hold him!
He didn't take anything since a week.
Will you please shut up?
You're a doctor! Don't lament like a kid.
l'm a kid for my father.
He made me a doctor.
Okay relax!
Don't give him anything to eat.
- Okay sir.
Sir, my feeling is,
he'll recover if he takes something.
lf he takes anything...then
order for a chicken briyani.
Do You've any sense?
Can he take anything?
lt'll get stuck in his throat.
Don't consider him a patient.
Consider to be a human
with blood and flesh.
Sister, tell him.
This is your subject.
Rajaram, will you...- Thank you.
Hello, hey Vaddi... not audible.
l'm holding it in my left hand
and talking, that's why.
Hear attentively.
Why're you laughing man?
Who can play better than this?
lt's good only if the sound is heard.
Brother, Zakhir.
Come, you've come before 12'O'clock.
Didn't you watch the full movie?
Why's he laughing? What happened?
What else will happen,

Okay, pocket the coin....

He'll not know which to strike!
First he has to strike red

Can you differentiate between
red and black?
His sight is not good!
Oh!!!
Very good! He has pocketted it.
So what? Pocketting a follow on coin
is difficult at this age.
Let's see whether
he pockets it or not?
Let's see it...- Look, how he's staring.
Take this juice.- Give it to me...
He has ended his fast
by taking the juice.
Father... father...
Out of affection, don't squeeze him
and take out the juice.
Marg, be careful! Give that juice.
You're god, Raja.
you've saved my father.
Oh god, you've stamped my foot.
One god is enough,
why another god!
No use of being a doctor.
You didn't know the technic of
legendary Vittalachariya!
ln his movie, a human's life will
be confined in a Parrot.
Similarly, your father's life
was confined in this carom board.
Had you maintained the board well
powdered, then he'll also be fine.
Brother, me too...- You also want
to stamp my foot. Oh hug me..
Brother, me too... Once..
- Enough...

We've lost in what we had to win.
Even if you ask questions to the
one who doesn't know the answer,
he'll find out and
give a wrong answer at least.
l don't know the question itself.
l'm nothing.
Embracing therapy is
what my mother taught me.
Anybody can do that to anybody.
l'm not Rajaraman, just Tenaliraman.
l'll tell you everything openly.
l'm a rowdy.
Just collection Raja.
l cheated and joined this college.
l agree that was wrong.
You may wonder that
l've suddenly become good and,
accepting all my mistakes?
l've not turned honest suddenly.
Yesterday.
Sorry.
Zakir died in my hands yesterday.
l was helpless.
He didn't consider me even as doctor.
He considered me as God.
Do you know why l'm crying.
l had breached his trust.
l didn't breach anybody's trust
when l was a rowdy.
lf l had promised to collect,
l would promptly collect and hand it over
on that specific date.
l was helpless in this case.
That's why l couldn't.
lf l had saved him for some more time.
His mother would've seen him.
When l couldn't do that,
what if l be a rowdy or doctor.
Uncle, you're very clever.
Not only my father,
you made me also cry publicly.
You've won. l've lost, okay.
A request of this loser to
the winner! Will you conceed it?
Zakir's mother will be
coming now by train.
Don't trouble her by asking her to
observe all the formalities to take his body.
So sad! They'll pester her for bribe.
Without troubling her,
handover his body.
She may have to perform
many rites.
lt'll be helpful if
you do this for me.
Do you know how
l'm going to help you.
l'm leaving this college.
Go alone and laugh as much as
you like.
That's all. Thanks a lot.
That's it. lt's over.
Hereafter we won't have his trouble.
Get back to your business.
Congratulations daddy.
You've won. Congrats.
As you wished, there'll be discipline,
dignity and decorum here.
Nobody will embrace anybody here.
Nobody will sing, dance.
No patients will have a smiling face.
That's what you want, isn't it daddy?
When there are so much
of medicines etc.
How dare he cured a patient
by playing carom board.
How can we permit that?
Atrocious! Meddler.
Patients who are counting their days.
Making them happy by singing songs.
How could we remain silent
after seeing it.
lf he embraces everybody foolishly.
Does that mean we've to allow it?
Hell with this embracing therapy.
Shouldn't we jail such a person?
Look...Anandan who was sleeping
peacefully for 12 years.
He has woken him up.
Oh god!
lf we've love, affection
and if we care for the patient,
did you see it's consequences?
Such miracles will not take
place in this hospital anymore.
Never...
You'll not allow it to happen.
You've won daddy congrats.
Not only you were in coma, me too.
Now, l've also awakened.
Thank you.
l don't think this will work out.
l'm planing to do my old business.
Collection?
No..
Decided to go back to my village
as a son of my father.
l don't know why l remember
my mother a lot now.
Brother, you remembered
mother, didn't you?
Look here.- What?
Mother..
ls this the time to
come back home?
Where were you both roaming?
Why have you bowed your head?
Don't know how to seek pardon?
Hey, l've to seek your
pardon justifiably.
l bravely left that day
declaring that you're not my son.
Today l'm chasing all the passers by and
telling them proudly that you're my son.
Still, l couldn't become a doctor.
What are you going to do
after becoming a doctor.
You'll give medicines, won't you?
Can you give new life
to other's as you do now?
As soon as l talked about new life,
l remembered one thing.
What's her name?
Pappu is waiting upstairs
since a long time. Go and meet her.
Why did she come here?
She had brought us here.
Hey, you go and...

Are you going or

Now do you understand,

Hey, go.
Pappu, how are you?- l'm fine.

That's...nobody is marrying me.
Look, l dress up decently nowadays.
Then, too nobody believes.
Can you marry me?
Oh god. That's not possible.

The person whom you know.
Your friend Janaki.

Okay by me.
You became Janaki

That time also l was Janaki.
Now tell me, whom do you want to marry?

Put your finger down please.
Which finger?- This one.
Tensed?
