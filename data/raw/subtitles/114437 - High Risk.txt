Good kids!
What can I help you?
Move!
Let me go.
Don't panic,
someone will come to save us soon.
Alright, don't cry...
Captain Li, your wife
and son are on the car.
Got you.
Little kids, don't cry...
Don't cry!
It's same as the blackmail case
happened in a shopping centre
last month.
I think it's done by the same gang.
The metallic thread is connected
to the bottom of the car,
the explosive power
must be very great.
What do the criminals want?
The criminals are kidnapping
three students from rich families.
Their fathers are billionaires
in HK and Singapore.
They want each to pay
5 million US dollars.
Captain...
We have no time, follow me.
Captain...
On the floor!
This is land mine,
the equipment of the US Army.
- Dad, please save me.
- Kit, you must be very careful.
Don't touch those metallic wires,
it'll cause explosion.
Check the time.
It seems to be easily fixed.
It's made purposely,
so as to let us despise it.
Kidding! It should be very simple.
Cut the yellow line.
It won't be that simple.
Give me the microscope.
A tiny metallic thread
must be cut too.
The one who designed this bomb
must be a genius.
You may call him bastard too.
Let me try.
Alright, remove the third piece
of computer chip.
Have you got it?
The main wire is here!
Bastard.
One of it
will cut the electric supply.
And the other one
will kill all of us.
If we cut it wrongly, it'll explode.
What's the difference
with gambling then?
Captain...
The criminal wants
to talk to you alone.
Dad...
Don't leave us alone.
I won't leave you.
Kit, you have to be careful.
I can save you.
Are you Lee Kit?
You may call me doctor.
What do you want?
I've collected the money.
I call to see
whether you have been killed or not.
You must have discovered
the tiny wire, haven't you?
No time's left,
tell me which line should be cut?
Red or blue?
You still have time, guess it.
Time's running short.
I beg you!
Let them alive!
Alive?
I killed so many enemies
in the war field,
But I was not posted to be hero.
However I was thought to be no body!
Who will let me alive?
We still have ten seconds.
Especially those needn't fight
in war field
but can be promoted.
For the sake of humanitarianism,
please tell me, isn't it red?
No risk , no reward.
Doctor!
Choose the red line!
It's alright, dad saved us,
it'll be alright.
Daddy... it's alright...
Granny, let me help you.
Thank you, it's hard to see
such a nice guy as you now.
This is my pleasure.
Kiddy...
After bomb squad member Li Kit's
wife and children were killed
in an explosion,
He's depressed,
he quit his job and disappeared.
It's said that he appeared
in Hong Kong two years later.
Move faster...
You want me to shoot
Frankie's stunt?
He jumps in each of his movie.
He needs no double of course.
Or, how can he be highly paid?
All audiences want to see him...
how to break his head
and break his legs.
Come on, drop it...
Frankie...
Big Brother...
He must have drunken too much!
See whether there is double!
Great! See you, OK, bye.
What did you see?
Be frank.
Yes.
You are honest.
Why not use double?
Nuts! Frankie never use double!
If someone knows it, it's a shame!
Frankie...
No.
Sure!
I can drink another bottle.
Pretty women, come here.
It's me, I am Charlie.
Of course I know you,
I know you, Charlie Tso.
Why don't you change some new pads?
So disgusting!
No, get a double at once.
Bold.
What's the matter?
Why are you sitting here?
Come down quickly.
Why are there
so many people around?
I don't know.
Let me do it...
If this is discovered,
we'll lose face.
Just like we acted in Canada.
Deal.
Move a bit over.
Hold it tightly! Got it?
Zoom tightly... a close up!
Come on...
Pay attention, I have to jump now.
I am coming!
Jump...
Daddy...
Don't leave me alone.
Kit, be careful.
Thank you...
Frankie asked you
to he his double again?
He doesn't feel well.
He drinks and fools around days
and nights!
Less than 20% of his Kung-fu
is left.
My son is losing his memory!
He forgets his wealth and fame
are originated from Kung-fu.
Uncle, he will regain his power
after some more practice.
Cut, rewind!
This guy doesn't seem to be Frankie.
He is a bit short.
And he isn't like Frankie too.
Are you suspecting that
he is a double?
Check again.
Stop!
Got it?
Frankie is running in now.
I have confidence to bet with you!
Frankie said,
he'd never use double
when doing dangerous stunt.
But you discovered his secret.
I've got it,
we can show it on the anniversary
of our TV station.
To bust his bubble.
Great! It's great.
Or, we should tail him
from day to night.
I've got a perfect idea.
He has many bodyguards,
don't despise him.
We are educated, we won't do that.
Let's do that!
No...
Bold,
come down and have fun with us.
Go ahead, I don't like swimming!
Who is swimming? We are taking
girl's advantages only.
Those women are sexy idols.
I have to go out for patrol.
How is it? Got it?
Yes.
- Good.
- Sure.
Be careful, I have to go down first.
Thank you.
You are shooting other's
secret lives, give me the tape.
How did you see us
shooting secretly?
Miss, don't be ridiculous,
or you will suffer.
Give me the tape.
If you have guts,
just come to take it.
Don't push me.
I love to, so what?
Sorry.
Sorry for offending you.
Are you alright?
Remember,
I will take a revenge
through a TV show.
Go, or I will let the dogs out.
I am so scared!
Don't pay any attention to him.
Run.
Shit, the dog is in.
Fatty, where are you?
I am in the car now, move...
Bastard! Remember what you've done!
Did you lose the machines?
Don't worry,
it's always been on my shoulder.
Help...
What's the matter?
Does Madonna ask me
to be in bed with her?
There is a jewel show,
I tell you, this will be held
in the penthouse
of the newly opened Grandtu Hotel.
Only 100 VIPs will be invited.
What kind of jewels? So precious?
They are jewels of the Russian Tzar
of the 18th Century.
Those jewels will be put
in three high tech display boxes.
They are controlled by computer,
and are bullet proof.
If one opens it
without the computer code.
It'll explode!
Any woman guests?
The most pretty and high classed
pretty women will be invited.
The invitation card's are
signs of social status.
Great.
But I have only
three invitation cards.
Except you and me,
will you take Bold there?
I'll ask him to wait for me
downstairs, I will go with daddy.
I am coming!
What's wrong with you?
How can you dry the pool?
Why did you jump down?
What'll we do?
Call the ambulance now!
All right!
He may not be that powerful.
Nuts, he is making movies.
I swear,
I have to fight with him once.
I have to see
whether he is that powerful or not.
Beware you would be beaten to death.
What did you say?
I won't lie down until I die.
I won't be defeated!
Alright, you are great, is that OK?
Hey guys, listen to me.
Two days later,
there will be a jewel show...
on the 75th floor of Grandtu Hotel.
They worth so much money that
the price is out of your expectation.
I am sure, if we get it successfully,
what you get will be enough
for your retirement.
Great!
Quiet!
Now, we have to watch
each other carefully.
No single move should be taken.
Some friends told me that,
there is an undercover among us.
Be frank, I am not sure
whether he has colleague or not,
but, you know my practice.
If I discover one,
I will kill him at once.
Kill... kill everyone who betrays me.
Don't you agree?
Doctor, I am not.
I know.
So, it must be you.
It's you!
Don't come over, or I will kill her.
Go ahead.
She is always ready to die for me.
Why are you standing here?
Go kill him now.
Stop!
Are you alright?
I am fine, just a little wound.
Mister, I am sorry,
our hotel will be opened
on Saturday.
I come to look for someone.
What can I help you?
You have to smile with feeling.
Be a bit sincere, OK?
I gave you all my sincerity.
Many rich merchants
will come to the show.
I want all the PRs
to welcome them with warmest smiles.
I will go back
and watch more comedies.
About movies,
Your idol Frankie
will come tomorrow.
He is great! I love him.
No, there will be security check
tomorrow.
You are not allowed
to wear gold necklace too.
So bad!
Isn't Frankie that great?
He never uses double when filming.
He always jumps down
from high place.
But he is a lady-killer.
So he must be a funny man.
How is it?
Don't know why!
There is a big pustule
on the shoulder.
When we got changed this morning.
I saw bandage on her shoulder.
Jayce, a cop wants to see you.
What's the matter?
Can we talk alone?
A cop is no big deal.
You didn't answer my phone.
And you don't want to see me,
so I have to see you in this way.
Forget it, let's break up.
I didn't attend our date
since I was having special duty.
Since the robbers killed
many of my colleagues.
I told you many times!
I don't want you to be a cop.
Today, your colleague is killed.
You may be killed on the next day.
I am scared.
I heard a gun war yesterday.
My heart kept on beating!
Do you care about me?
At least you should give me a call.
I am sure I won't do that again,
I will be very careful.
Forget it, when the pager rings,
you'll become a super cop.
No, I...
Jayce, I am off.
Wait for me!
Jayce!
Jayce!
Go.
Jayce, listen to me!
I'll be promoted soon,
let's talk about it later, OK?
Do you think
you are Rambo?
Jayce!
What's up?
My friend!
Fai Fai, are you alright?
Yes.
Mister, do you know driving?
Do you know him?
No.
I will take your car.
My pleasure.
- Wait...
- Please!
Jayce, don't go with him.
Can you listen
to me?
Jayce...
I think you know him, right?
They are quarreling!
Do you want to drink a cup of coffee
in my place?
No, thanks.
My mom is waiting for me.
I will get off right in front of it.
Here is your home?
I will take the MTR, bye-bye.
Any bad feeling?
When I like a woman,
she can never escape from me.
I have a bad news for you,
Frankie will go tomorrow.
Really? The movie star Frankie?
He is a hero in movie.
In fact,
he may not be that powerful.
If he is powerful, so?
We can't allow any mistake happened.
Ask Bond to kill him.
Mind your head and legs.
It's you again! Timing isn't good!
Your leg...
Left leg... Right leg...
All lie down!
Cut! It's OK!
Frankie...
You...
What's wrong with you?
Go and take a look.
It's no big deal.
Go.
What's the problem?
Frankie, look,
you always speak foul language.
See, you are scolding others again.
I should have scolded them,
or they didn't react.
Let me do the dubbing myself.
Go to hell...
Go to hell...
Go to hell...
It's OK!
Good! This is perfect!
Frankie,
your movie will make big money again.
Damn it! Are you kidding?
The dubbing room is so dirty!
Cockroaches are everywhere!
I won't come next time!
I am going to wash my hand.
So dirty!
But you needn't go that fast.
I want to piss.
The little guys all escaped.
If I kill him now,
I can't fight with him any more.
But I swore,
I have to fight with him.
Bold, you are here!
You said I have to follow you
even you go pissing.
Bastard! You are so obedient!
- Mister, you forgot your stuff.
- Don't move.
If you trust me, don't move.
I trust you.
You are stepping on the land mine.
What? It's not war time!
Are you kidding?
You have known me for ages,
think, did I ever fool you?
What am I going to do now?
Bring me a rod.
I'll count three.
Step back and I will kick it away.
You have no choice.
- Ready.
Wait.
My foot is cramping!
Let me massage it for a while.
Come on!
One.
Two.
Three.
Bye bye.
Frankie is coming.
She seems to like me.
Be careful, she may eat you.
Don't know if you have time...
Dad, hurry up!
We meet again!
What's wrong? No battery again!
Hello, speaking.
I will be right there.
What?
I've told you before.
Alright,
that's it.
Do you want me to teach you?
Man should depend on himself.
Man should depend on himself.
Mister, what're you doing?
Mister, you can't go in!
Thank you.
- The exhibition is in there.
- Okay.
This is new model.
I am scared.
This electronic dictionary
can translate French, Japanese,
and it can communicate, right?
This dictionary can communicate
with another within short distance.
I am the bodyguard of Mr. Frankie.
I suspect a terrorist has sneaked
in the jewel show.
What's the name of the criminal?
Do you describe his face?
I just recognize his voice!
I don't know his face.
That silly boy doesn't fit you.
You have to find a mature man.
Leave me alone!
I like that silly boy.
Someone is calling me.
Can you ask Mr. Frankie down?
The problem is, I don't believe you
to be his bodyguard,
please go.
There is a criminal, it's true!
Only VIPs are invited.
There won't be any criminals,
you'd better leave.
Don't worry.
- I will report to the police.
- Go.
How is it? No negative?
- I will go and take some here.
- Come back as soon as possible!
Frankie,
it's safe to stand next to you.
Really?
You are such a pretty girl that,
I wish I could provide you more...
condoms!
No, I mean sense of security!
You are so funny!
You're welcome...
Your new movie will be showing soon,
don't forget me.
Sure...
I'll invite you to my home too.
See, Frankie is taking
a girl's advantage.
Hurry up, shoot him.
Impossible!
Hide it...
Be careful,
there is security officers.
Miss, are you alright?
Alright?
I am fine!
Be careful,
you have dropped something.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Dad, don't worry.
Sponsored by the TNS security system.
The show of
Tzar Nicholar II's jewels
is now started.
Dad, I am going to sleep.
What's up?
Delivery!
- What is it?
- Bullet.
I am all amazed.
You are as pretty as a queen,
you will have chance to wear it.
I hope so.
What are you looking at?
Still looking?
I will give you a blow!
Get lost.
Sorry.
You should be a bit smart!
Mister, what do you want?
Changing shift!
Help me...
Get lost!
Don't come over...
Help me...
Please, hands off...
I beg you, please leave me alone!
One is escaped. Chase him!
He must have gone to the basement.
Bring someone to the penthouse,
I will kill him.
Don't talk.
There are many killers
in this hotel.
Don't scare me.
I didn't.
See, my trousers are removed!
If you go out, you will be raped.
Don't worry.
I will protect you.
I hear something.
For your sake,
I decided to check it out.
There is a corpse, I am scared.
Me too.
The men of here and from the lobby
were all killed.
You have to protect me.
I will draw their attention away,
and you, call the police.
Do you love me?
I love you.
I love you too.
Be careful.
Be careful.
I am scared,
if I go out,
I will be easily killed.
Before I go, can you encourage me?
Help!
Frankie!
Come and save me!
Frankie, I know you are around.
Your girl is with me.
If you don't come out,
I will kill her.
If you are a man, come out!
I will count three.
One.
Frankie!
- Two.
- Frankie.
Super hero?
My ass!
Can you send someone
to check it out with me?
The Doctor you mentioned
entered the Grandtu Hotel,
but you don't know his outlook,
how can we look for him?
What? Grandtu Hotel?
He said there are criminals
inside the hotel.
I suspect that
the man behind a blackmail case
happened 2 years ago
is inside the hotel.
How do you know it?
I came across with him,
I heard his voice.
This guy ruined my family,
I could never forget his voice.
Do you remember his face?
I just talked to him
through the telephone.
There is a jewel show in the hotel.
Yes,
there are many securities there.
I will call a police
and check it out.
Your girlfriend is working there,
you may give her a call.
I will follow you.
Will there be any problem?
Mister, may I...
Get lost!
Damn it!
I am here with you, don't panic.
I am afraid of you.
Don't panic.
Call the police!
The phone is inside the pocket!
Shit!
Ladies and gentlemen.
We just want money but not lives.
If you don't co-operate with us,
you will die.
Sit properly,
don't pull off a stunt.
Even the police come,
they will be killed.
Do you understand?
We are lucky to report this news!
Mr. Chan Lap Ming from the
security company, please come out.
Yes, I am.
Mr. Chan, the code please.
The specialist came this morning
to set up,
so I don't know the code.
I know nothing!
I know nothing!
Move faster,
you have to find out the code
within 45 minutes.
Yes, sure. No problem.
It's my job!
I am Bond,
I am always dreaming of
fighting with you.
To see how powerful you are!
Kidding!
Mr. Bond, you are the super hero!
Are you Frankie?
No.
You disappoint me so much.
Please, don't hit my face.
I have to work tomorrow, please!
Thank you.
Rabbit, a car is coming.
It depends,
maybe, let him in and kill him.
Got you.
I will go in and take a look,
wait for me.
I will go in with you.
No, what can you help me?
Why not?
You needn't go with me.
I won't give you any trouble.
Sorry, this is a private show.
Do you have any invitation card?
CID, I suspect that
there are robbers in your hotel,
where is your manager?
He's just been off.
When will the security officers
shift duty?
Mister, what's the problem?
An hour ago,
you were not guarding the entrance.
We have just changed our shift.
I have to go up and take a look.
Alright, please follow me.
Get in.
You are really great.
Thank you.
We have no way out.
I was just thinking
whether you would leave me alone.
I won't leave anyone behind.
They are fierce!
They are cold-blooded.
What'll we do now?
We just have a way out.
Go to the penthouse.
To the penthouse?
What? They are driving up
by taking the elevator?
Take this.
What's it?
This is sent by my girl,
it's one of a pair.
We can communicate through it
in short distance.
If I die,
please hand this
to my girlfriend Jayce.
So, you mean I must be dead meat!
Come on!
Boss, lighter... give me face,
I am a star.
Frankie.
Frankie!
Dad, don't worry.
They will go
after making money.
Don't move, squat, listened?
Squat!
Jump.
Be quick!
Kam!
Run!
Retreat...
I will kill whoever moves!
Freeze.
Run!
Mind yourself!
Run.
No way...
Don't forget daddy!
Don't move! Everyone don't move.
Or,
I will kill this computer expert.
Come here.
If I kill him,
you can't open the computer safe.
So, you will have a total failure!
That old man is tough!
Shoot him!
Don't move.
Tell them not to move! Got it?
Or, I will kill him.
Ask them to drop the weapons.
Hurry up!
Drop the weapon.
Uncle, take him here,
I will help to guard him.
OK, go.
Jayce, are you alright?
I am alright, hands off me.
The policemen are coming,
I am a cop, stay calm.
- Hello... look!
- It's you!
I recorded the process
of the robbery.
You needn't be a good citizen
like this.
None of your business.
Frankie, come on, smile.
Don't shoot below.
What're you afraid of?
This is fresh looking!
- Come on...
- Sorry!
Thank you so much!
Man should depend on himself.
It's you!
You are Doctor!
Catch the reporter of the TV station
and get back the tape.
Inform Fai Fai, ready for plan B.
OK, let's go.
Oh, you are a nasty guy!
Shut up.
Or I will throw you down.
Don't kill her,
if you want to kill, kill me.
Mr. Police, I won't kill you.
For you are a perfect hostage.
