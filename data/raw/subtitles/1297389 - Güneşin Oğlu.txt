The events in this film
are based on a true story.
Names and locations have
however been changed...
...out of respect for those
who lost their lives.
I am Fikri Þemsigil.
A retired literature teacher
who is getting old.
And if there is one thing that
aging has taught me...
...it is that the world
is full of miracles.
People living in buildings
on top of one another...
...bicycles cruising
on two wheels only...
...maybe not the takeoff
but the landing of a plane...
These are all miracles.
And do you know which one
the biggest miracle of all is?
Getting old.
Staying right on the line
separating the two sides.
Being able to take a long look
on whichever side...
...you choose to turn to.
You may choose to look on life,
or on death.
This power can sometimes overwhelm
you to such an extent that...
...had I my present conscience,
I wouldn't get old.
There are good sides too,
of course.
For instance,
those of us who grew old...
...are ready to believe in anything,
even if we don't want to.
Especially in miracles.
Because our hearts are
so full of broken dreams...
...we always think we deserve a right
to start all over again.
One last opportunity before
the final whistle.
A cross pass
for a splendid goal.
A penalty shot
during the additional period.
Waking up one morning, we'll realise
that everything has changed.
We are 25 years old again,
and lying next to us...
...is not our wife for 40 years,
but the hottie living across.
But waking up every morning, we look
and things are still the same.
One of the same old mornings.
You're still in the same bed.
And it's not that hottie
lying beside you.
Only your wife for 40 years:
Saadet Þemsigil.
Here is the best thing about
getting old.
Things have been the same
for 58 years.
The sun has been rising again
every day for 58 years.
Which means that
nothing is going to change.
Which means that
any moment a miracle may occur.
Which means that
the hottie living across...
...has been waiting for today
to invite me with a smile.
Which means that
today is the big day.
Fikri? You're awake?
Unfortunately.
Have you watered the flowers?
No time.
My God, Fikri! How can you wish
to be funny in the early morning?
There are other things
I'd also like to do, only...
Not now, dear.
I don't want to lapse into perversity
on my own accord.
What are you looking at?
The sun.
The sun?
What do you expect to see?
Have you no skill of imagination,
Saadet?
I had, before I married you Fikri.
But then my imaginative abilities
made way to the need to be grounded.
I set my dreams in my will to
remain grounded.
Then your imagination is weak but
your dreams are powerful. Is that it?
Happily your Turkish isn't too bad.
I don't think
you got will power Saadet.
Your ambition is weak.
I think I'll go to the market
this morning.
We ran out of potatoes and stuff.
Today, the greatest solar eclipse
known in history.
At 8.03 a.m. The eclipse, visible to
the naked eye, will take place...
...and last for two whole minutes.
Prof. Dr. Nevzad Trabzon said:
"The world is on the brink of
a big change.
Special souls should be
ready for anything. "
Special souls, huh?
Nights take you to me,
riding like the wind.
Days, bleeding wounds in my heart.
Darkness is the witness
of my violent love.
I cry that the sun is
a blasphemy to us.
Alper Canan! You wrote this poem
last night, didn't you?
What an appropriate
insight Mr. Fikri!
How did you realise
I wrote this yester night?
The sound of your keyboard
crackled in my ears all night.
You probably imagined that a poet
replete with emotion like me...
...would use a fountain pen.
I am more surprised that a poet
replete with emotion like you...
...should be doing his morning sport.
I was expecting to find you...
...suffocating in tears and
cigarette smoke.
I am a poet of the Millennium.
The kind of poet you're talking
passed away 1000 years ago.
I write poems with my heart,
so I should preserve my heart.
Moreover, that your awaiting
my suffocation grieves me.
Grief... What a pompous word.
Grief? A pompous word?
I don't know.
I've never pondered over it.
Is there anything
you've ever pondered over, I wonder?
Son! Son, what happened? Get up!
Come on, wake up!
This lad is a beauty.
Who knows what you've drunk!
Did you use drugs as well
to become so?
Morning, Mrs. Hamiyet.
Morning, morning.
Accustomed to your flat?
Super, perfect. Thank God.
Wonderful, wonderful.
My respects.
The same here.
Good morning, dear sir.
Everything all right?
Been checking out?
Checking out?
You said checking out?
I am 58, Burak. And what's more,
I am a retired teacher.
And more, today, you would know
had you read the news...
...though I am sure...
...you only use newspapers to wipe
your hands after masturbation.
Today, in exactly 8 minutes,
the longest, greatest and...
...most intense solar eclipse
in 14000 years will take place.
NASA is under alert, Russia remains
vigilant and Israeli authorities...
...put their intelligence at work
over this eclipse, and you...
...you flash those yellow straying
teeth to me...
...simpering some
"Been checking out?"
Burak! Check out indeed!
Dear viewers, there is only
1 minute left before the eclipse...
...the whole world has been
impatiently waiting for.
Not only the world. The eclipse,
the universe has been waiting for.
Yes. Less than a minute before the
solar eclipse the universe expects.
People familiar with the subject,
would know that...
...Nevzad Trabzon is a worldwide
recognised authority...
...on the subject of eclipses
and of their influence.
Mr. Trabzon,
what exactly is a solar eclipse?
Dear Madam, a solar eclipse is the
most extraordinary natural event...
...that a human eye can watch.
It is a kind of miracle.
For those who are ready for it...
...it can appear as a miracle
with a personality of its own.
What do you mean?
Every beauty only reveals itself to
those who are ready for it, Madam.
She is a real beauty.
As for the others,
they will be fascinated and...
...they will lose their consciousness
and finally go to pieces.
Look. Look at this beauty.
Wonderful. Perfect.
Here is what I meant to tell you.
Could an ordinary personality
come to understand such a beauty?
Only special souls can cope
with this. Only special souls.
I don't know why
but this beauty reminds me of death.
This eclipse may not
quake the world...
...but it could certainly upset
several worlds.
Could you explain this further?
Watch it happen in silence.
It's all obvious.
This is a true miracle.
Hi!
How are you? Going to uni?
I thought we could go together.
OK, let's go.
- What were you doing in this flat?
- Excuse me?
That was the flat of Fikri's family,
wasn't it?
He's a retired teacher, isn't he?
Yes, I am Fikri Þemsigil,
retired literature teacher.
- Being very funny again this morning.
- Why are you saying this?
Please Ahmet. Wnough.
Ahmet?
My God!
How do you come up
with such clowning around?
What clowning? What's the matter?
Ahmet? I turned into Ahmet.
Is Ahmet that kid with the telescope?
What happened to Ahmet, indeed?
Oh my God!
The bastard's gone.
What are you doing, Ahmet,
for God's sake?
I became him!
It's Ahmet, isn't it?
Is it how miracles happen?
Is this a miracle now?
What miracle, Ahmet?
I must find Saadet.
Look. Lectures start in half an hour.
Let's go to the dining hall
for breakfast.
Breakfast? Two of us?
One on one?
Breakfast? Two of us?
One on one? Breakfast?
Wow! How nice university it is!
It wasn't like that in our years.
I'll go and get some tea.
Do you want cheese in your pastry?
- OK.
- Do you like cheese pastry?
Yes, I do.
You pesky old man!
Did we come to that? Hey, hush!
- Hey Ahmet! What's up, pal?
- What do you think you're doing, son?
Son? Nice one! Son!
Grabbed a chick?
Grabbed her, yeah.
But be careful.
Oya would kill you.
Oya?
Ahmet, how many sugars, dear?
Sugar? I'd drink this tea
were you to pour poison into it.
Two. Yes, two is OK.
Did you watch the eclipse
this morning?
- I fully experienced it, Þule.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?
Wonderful?
"The destiny has made me the
slave of a gazelle-eyed beauty. "
It's a poem by Yavuz Sultan Selim.
What a great person you can be,
Ahmet!
Do not mention it, Mrs. Þule.
Mrs. Þule?
You're really funny!
Why am I great?
I don't know! You're really handsome
and you're the best at uni.
Both don't generally come together.
Generalities are generally deceptive.
By the way,
I also think you are beautiful.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.
For three years, I've been going
to sleep, thinking about you.
Every morning I rush to my window
in the hope that I could see you.
What window?
Don't you live in Beþiktaþ?
Well, I run to Mr. Fikri's window.
I take the bus coming from Gümüþsuyu.
I get off at AKM and
run down there.
Mr. Fikri is my uncle.
- Is that so?
Yes. And I'm thinking of
staying with them.
Wow! That would be great! You could
also help me with my homework.
Sure! I could even do them for you
by myself from time to time.
You're a darling!
I was sure you were a great person.
Ahmet!
Oya, isn't it?
What the hell
are you talking about?
Damn you, Ahmet!
You've broken my heart.
Oya, stop! It is not what you think.
Let me explain. Oya!
Hey, what am I supposed to explain?
I'm really confused.
What's wrong? Who am I?
What happened to me?
"Like the wind"
is really important here.
Poetry is an art of images.
No image, no poetry.
Just like that. Really.
I come with delight among the images,
I come leaping above the flowers,
Oh raki, wine, liquor, come to us.
Let us drink our souls
in liquor's hands.
What's up?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not doing anything, Oya.
Not doing anything?
I've seen you with two different
girls in the last two minutes!
You will pay for this, Ahmet!
Please, Oya! What are you doing?
Where did you find this?
Have you forgotten
my dad is the chief of police?
What's going on?
What will I do? What will I do, hey?
Mr. Alper, could you sign for Sevgi?
Please...
Sevgi? Damn it!
Damn it!
Am I Alper Canan now?
This is nonsense! What is this?
Damn it!
Poet! Poet, my ass!
Old pervert!
Just for a shag what kind of
situation you've dug into, moron!
All this,
is to sleep with college girls.
Sorry!
Have you been talking to me?
No. I was just
working on a new poem.
Something slightly erotic...
The nights are...
Damn it! Broken!
What are you doing here, sir?
What does it look like
I am doing Saadet?
I'm trying to repair this,
can't you see?
Mr. Alper...
Oh, Mrs. Saadet...
Excuse me...
I was doing this telescope thing.
But why are you doing
this thing here? Where is Fikri?
If only I knew...
What has happened to him?
Well, I...
Saadet, look. I'll tell you something
but you must believe me. All right?
I... Sit down there.
Compose yourself.
Saadet...
I am your husband. I am Fikri.
I swear!
I was watching the sun this morning
and you asked me what I was doing.
I said I was looking at the sun.
Then you asked
what I expected to see.
And I told you,
your ambitions were weak, remember?
I am Alper Canan.
Alper, stop.
Don't do this. Don't hit me.
I'm getting up now.
Please, don't hit me.
Stop please, Mrs. Cahide.
Cahide, isn't it?
Why would I hit you?
This bastard...
Does he beat you Cahide?
Alper...
What happened? Are you OK?
Your phone is ringing.
- Hello?
- Taxi's waiting downstairs.
It'll take you to where you're
supposed to be. Come on, quick!
Don't go!
Don't go this time!
Where are you taking me?
Who sent you?
Have you swallowed your tongue?
Talk, man!
Go to hell!
Get out here.
What the hell are you here for?
Sorry? Have you forgotten
that I'm the middlewoman?
You couldn't have found him
without me!
- Find whom?
- Alper, what's wrong with you today?
I wish I knew.
Really, you're weird...
You were weird already at school
this morning.
Cursing loudly
as you left the school.
Has your love for me
driven you crazy?
- Money first.
- Money?
- What money?
- What for?
- Is the guy joking?
- Alper, are you joking?
Give him the money already.
- But I don't have any money with me!
Oh... I have. Sorry.
I have money.
Right. Have you decided
on the modalities?
- I did, for my part.
- What modalities?
I'm getting bored.
You said he should strangle her,
don't you remember? With a string.
Who will be strangled?
Don't drive me mad.
We've been over this 50 times.
You have chosen strangulation?
- Me?
Right. We've made our decision.
String. We want strangulation.
Good choice.
Noiseless at least.
At 5 p. M, you should bring her
to the place that I tell you.
No. The place that I tell you.
This guy acts like a dumbass.
I hope he won't be a trouble.
If he makes trouble,
I will make trouble as well.
And if I make trouble,
that means serious trouble!
Got it?
Understood, for my part.
Alper, what's the matter with you
for God's sake?
You almost blew everything.
We must move apart now.
Bring Cahide when I call you.
Cahide? So this guy is
going to strangle Mrs. Cahide?
Is that what
we gave him money for?
Look at me Alper.
If you mean to walk out on me...
...I'll tell everything to
everyone.
Everything? What's everything?
And to whom will you tell?
What's this? What kind of a trap
have I fallen into? What's this?
Oh, a 100 kilo negro hung himself,
He came down the next night,
No sound came from the hutch.
Were it me, I would be ashamed,
What kind of a student is this,
Well away from his lessons
and fatter than anyone else?
The self-hung negro
was a fine marksman.
He weeps for lack of beer,
his father is a miller.
Were he not better than you,
his divorce would come first,
I am so bored;
let's kill birds with stones.
What is happening?
Mate? Mate, are you OK?
Are you dead, my friend? Hello?
Nothing's wrong with him.
He can't die.
Burak. You daft, Burak!
You zigzagging animal
bearing a tray, Burak!
Burak!
What's up? What's happening?
Can I have a coffee?
Coffee? Sure, right away!
Something else you'd like with it?
What do you mean, Mr. Necati?
What the hell are you talking about,
son? Get up! Clients are waiting.
Oh, fuck!
I turned into Burak now!
Don't you swear
in front of customers, half-wit.
But I can't understand
the way it happens.
Does it happen totally by chance?
Or is it because...
...I thought about Burak,
or imagined myself in his shoes?
But why should I think about Burak?
What do I care about
being a low-life?
What are you talking about?
Have you lost your mind?
I'm not sure. Could one turn
schizoid, out of the blue?
Get in there!
Get your money and fuck off! Go!
And in order to get
still more information...
...we are after Nevzad Trabzon.
Mr. Trabzon, please...
Look, madam...
I can't unravel
the mystery of the universe.
But you are the most learned person
on the subject of solar eclipses.
Yes, but it takes years
in order to gain such knowledge.
Thus, I do not intend to
share it with anyone.
As I told you, most souls
can't handle such a knowledge.
People in need of knowledge
will find me in person.
As you can see, Nevzad Trabzon
refuses to speak. Back to you, Arzu.
Mrs. Cahide!
Mrs. Cahide!
Mrs. Cahide!
Look. A little later...
...around four o'clock,
your husband will be home.
He'll want to take you somewhere.
Beware! Do not go.
My husband
wants to take me somewhere?
No, not like that.
Well, that's it.
He'll take you somewhere,
and there he will kill you.
They will strangle you.
With a string. Noiseless.
- Burak!
- What?
Who the hell are you?
Rascal!
Still, you're a good actor.
Who are you, pal?
What do you want?
I've found it, buddy.
What the fuck did you find?
- Well, I have found this.
- What's that?
Let's go to your place and
discuss the details.
Is this where Burak lives?
I didn't realise.
Drop the bullshit, son.
The king of guns is here.
- Where did you find this?
- I just found it!
What shall we do with it?
We may not
have a great need of this.
My plan is based on not using it.
Because we must not use it.
Is that so,
you brainless peasant dog?
What is this plan of yours?
- What's wrong, son?
Keep cool.
What kind of talk is that?
Stop it and explain your plan.
What will we do?
Mr. Necati's friend's wedding is
today, isn't it? In 15 minutes or so.
- Let's say, it is.
- Now he has gone to the wedding.
Now you're going to the shop.
Five minutes later, I break in.
In the meantime,
you arrange it so that...
...there's no one but you
near the register.
You bawl out and give me
whatever is in the register.
Then I run away. How's that?
- Now, is that your perfect plan?
If you have a better one,
let's do it.
That is what I have come up with.
And it's me who found the gun.
Still talking about the gun!
- Have you seen Mr. Necati?
- The boss is furious. Go away.
Don't butt in, Sinan.
Where? In the kitchen?
Didn't you piss off yet? Do you
intend to get yourself killed?
- Shut up! Listen...
- What are you talking about?
I've been running a place in Beyoðlu
for 10 years. Think you frighten me?
Frighten? God, no! I just wanted to
warn you about something, sir.
I have this
really stupid friend, Serkan.
He's not as stupid as me, though.
In 10-15 minutes, he'll come
and try to rip off the cash box.
This is why I'm telling you to close
the shop or take some precaution.
Now my only wish
for that stupid Serkan...
...is to come here with a gun
in his hand.
So this is what I'll do Mr. Necati:
I'm lowering my gun.
- You better.
- Of course. No hassle.
Fikri! Fikri, remain calm.
You know what to do.
You'll go and find this
Prof. Whatever.
He'll explain everything to you.
But now, calm down.
You're an old man.
Saadet?
Now I understand how pretty
we look together.
You're such a child, Fikri.
Tell me, how could you
disappear like that?
In the name of Allah, the most
Gracious and the most Compassionate.
Go away, the demon kind!
Help me, o Muhammad! Help!
Hey, Fikri, enough!
Enough with your crazy gestures,
since the police station!
Fikri!
- Yes, Saadet?
Stop, Burak.
No time for your chintzy jokes.
Come on in my dear.
My God! My God! My God!
In the name of Allah, the most
Gracious and the most Compassionate.
Go away, the demon kind!
Do you remember this, Fikri?
We bought this vase in Wrdek.
I wanted a blue one but
you bought this.
You remember the vase,
don't you?
How stupid I am!
I didn't put the keys back!
- My God!
- Fikri, what's happened to you?
I'm really worried about you.
What's wrong with you?
Are you angry with me?
Yes, you are.
I didn't carry on with you this
morning, and you got angry, huh?
All right, then.
- All right, let's do it. Come.
- In the name of Allah...
Come on Fikri, my beau.
- Come on darling.
- God help me!
Kiss me. Kiss me, darling.
My God! My God!
In the name of Allah...
Come on, kiss me Fikri.
What's going on here?
What's going on here?
What are you doing here?
Are you psycho?
Saadet, shut up.
Sit down there. Sit down.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you, I said!
Have you lost your mind?
He is Fikri, can't you see?
I am Fikri.
Shut up for one second.
Right. I've been Ahmet.
I've been Alper Canan.
Now I am Burak.
This is how that guy
got into my empty body.
Well, who's this guy
that got into me?
And then
whom has Burak got into?
Saadet, tell me the truth.
Did Burak get into you?
Man, what a situation!
I'll go mad! What a screw!
I know you won't believe me,
but I'll explain it all, Saadet.
This morning, I looked from here with
this device. I found this on my way.
I was looking at the sun.
The girl living across
might have caught my eye too.
God damn you, Fikri!
Saadet...
But afterwards I looked at the sun.
The solar eclipse.
You know the solar eclipse,
don't you?
The moon passes in front of the sun
and hides it, right?
A really magical moment.
As if reality wanted to scream
deep inside the darkness.
As if the universe
wished to swallow everything.
And then recreate them all.
But afterwards...
In the name of Allah,
most Gracious and most Compassionate.
Help me o Muhammad!
Stupid Serkan! Brainless!
This gun is a toy! A toy!
Fikri! Stop it, Fikri!
What are you doing, man?
You almost killed yourself.
Are you crazy?
- Burak! Go away! Leave, I tell you!
All right, I'm leaving Saadet.
But I have a little favour
to ask you.
Don't go to bed with this guy.
I beg you, don't you ever.
My God, if it were your act,
you'd have to understand that...
...I am an old man.
I can't stand such a fuss.
I am neither Bonny nor Clyde.
I'm a pitiful retired
literature teacher.
This farce is too much for me.
Oya!
Oya, look,
I can explain everything.
I have a score to
settle with you, whore!
Whore? Me?
What's going on?
Why did you do that?
Why did you confuse Ahmet's feelings?
Not enough boys for you around here?
You've seduced all the boys
at the university already.
You could at least have left
my poor Ahmet alone!
Ahmet is dead, did you know?
A brain haemorrhage,
and he's dead!
Þule, you weren't shot.
You weren't shot.
You're not dead. Run away!
I'm not dead either. Who died?
Oh God! Everybody dies.
What the hell!
Everybody dies. I'm going mad!
What can I do for you, sir?
I'd like to meet Nevzad Trabzon.
Well, this professor who was
on TV all day.
I'm sorry, he's not here.
Where is he?
Can you give me his address?
It is a matter of importance.
I'm sure it is important,
but it is made quite impossible...
...by the rules of our establishment.
All right, all right, sir.
Please don't get angry.
Rules are to be broken.
Aren't they?
You understand now.
Come on, girl. Come on.
All right. Here you are.
Who are you?
What are you doing in my office?
Professor, I need to talk to you.
It's very important.
I don't want to see anybody.
Go away.
Professor,
I'm sure you'll be interested.
There are things happening to me.
I keep coming in and out of people.
Since this morning,
I've been through all the crap.
Open the door, please.
Alper Canan!
Do you know this man? Who is it?
The neighbour downstairs.
Alper Canan, the poet.
All I found is a poet?
Well, then who are you?
You said you keep coming in and out
of people since this morning.
Do you think
it only happens to you?
Professor, what happened to us?
- We're screwed.
- What?
Screwed. Our lives are ruined.
We're wrecked.
Well, and on a theoretical
point of view?
- Theoretically we're screwed too.
- But why did it happen?
Why am I a triggerman and
why are you a poet?
I don't know.
Maybe God got angry with us.
"Thou lovest not thy neighbour...
...well, go and see
who the guy you dislike really is. "
Or are you the real Alper Canan
and pulling my leg?
My 20 minute-long experience
tells me that...
...poets don't pull
other peoples' legs.
It's simple.
The sun has sucked your soul
out of your body.
Your soul regained its freedom.
And thus, it keeps wandering
as it pleases.
But how? Why?
Why me? Why you?
You were born on the
15th of July 1950, weren't you?
Right during an eclipse.
And at 13.17.
Just a minute after me.
You were born in Çamlýca.
You mustn't have a younger brother.
- I haven't.
Women lose their fertility at births
that occur during an eclipse.
Veniente occoruto morbo.
- Excuse me?
- Not much, a Latin saying.
But my birth certificate is full of
this stuff. I may as well look there.
Fuck off and go look there then!
Why did you come up to me?
I just... Right, I'm sorry.
Please do come.
Try to help me anyway.
Go fetch the chalk.
This is not technically possible.
You will have to do it yourself.
Oh God! Wverything comes up
just as I've already feared.
I just couldn't do it on my own.
Since morning I've kept wandering
into stupid stumbling people.
It's not that simple. Those people
have to be connected to one another.
Well, yes.
We're all neighbours.
But this is not enough.
It takes a stronger bond.
A matter of life and death.
- Well...
Alper, don't drive me mad.
We've been over this 50 times.
You have chosen strangulation.
Well, yes,
there is one such thing, but...
To set your soul on its way,
one person...
No, at least one person
has to be dead.
Oh my God! Ahmet!
Oya told me Ahmet was dead.
There may be more than one.
Fuck! You're dead too.
Well, Alper Canan.
Of course! While screwing this girl
from the university!
My God, what a disgusting guy
I got into!
Of course. Alper died this morning
in the park. I got into him.
Then Alper Canan died.
I got out of Ahmet and into you.
Then you possessed another body and
this dirty poet was left for my part.
Yes. And Burak too,
got hit by my car.
A shame he died too!
A body gets empty,
we get in turn into this body.
That's the basic principle.
But why?
Because we are the children
of the sun, and we are immortal.
What the fuck next!
- Don't get rude!
- Sorry.
How can I explain?
Think that you're chosen or
it's just a coincidence.
You were born 58 years from now,
right during a total solar eclipse.
We all were.
That eclipse was very special.
Some eclipses are the cause of
wars, some others of earthquakes...
...and the rest, of other
catastrophes.
And some play such
little jokes.
Scientists suppose
nothing happens.
They sheepishly look around and
wonder why everything is so calm.
This is because their minds
are set on the macrocosmos.
However, the total eclipse
on July 1950...
...showed its impact
on the microcosmic level.
The large universe
and the small universe.
Macrocosmos is the earth,
microcosmos is the man.
- Good, at least you know some things.
- I'm a retired literature teacher.
I know. You also tutored
the dumb children of the rich.
That's where
your money comes from.
You stacked them
on top of your retirement pension.
That's how you bought your flat.
- Not like that. It was a bargain.
It's not like I was flying high.
- Don't lie to me!
You've always flown high! You always
stopped to look at the sun.
You wished it was always sunny.
You dreamed of a life
in country.
You love camels
to such an absurd extent.
For instance,
who's your favourite singer?
- Zeki. Zeki Müren.
- See? The Sun of Music.
And after your retirement,
you meant to move to sunny Antalya.
Only Mrs. Saadet didn't want to.
- Saadet... Is she immortal too?
I hope not.
Mr. Nevzad!
I beg you, please be polite!
I'd love to but I have
more important things to do.
The point is, on the day we were
born, the sun took us to itself.
We belonged to it.
We were born just as the sun
was hidden behind the moon.
We represent all the things of the
2,5 minutes of the total eclipse:
All this new life, existence and
all the things that are not dark.
We are sons of the sun.
Or its daughters. Or shit!
It's inconsistent and foolish
anyway.
I'm in trouble.
Don't call it a trouble.
More like a blessing.
All ancient cultures
point out to this.
Spread over the last 4000 years...
...at least 1750 children of the sun
can be counted.
This includes the present
Wmperor of Japan.
Believe it or not.
It's just like Caesar said:
"Homines libenter
quod volunt credunt. "
But this won't change anything.
If you walk into a lion's cage saying
"I don't believe you're a lion"...
...then the lion
would screw you inside out.
- It would indeed!
- I've been following this for years.
There are 17 of us born right during
the July 15th, 1950 eclipse.
Of those, eight have already died.
That is, before today.
Why did the sun allow this?
Because the sun is not God,
good sir.
Nine people remain.
Nine free souls.
All of those have been going in and
out of the bodies of the dead...
...since this morning's eclipse.
Among them are two retired workers,
a midwife, a barber...
...a singer, an imam and so on.
- Are they all aware of this?
I realised 22 years ago, while
working on my lectureship thesis.
But you realised it this morning.
After it happened.
Others never realised a thing!
- Why didn't you tell any of us?
What would've happened
had I told you?
Even now, you hardly believe me.
Had I come to you two months ago,
saying, "You're a son of the sun.
Your soul will be freed
during the solar eclipse.
Watch your ass!"
Would you have believed me?
Is it necessary that you always take
examples with asses and shit?
No one else
has come to me until now.
I also spent time clowning around
on TV for them to understand.
Among the seven others, none has the
power of daydreaming you have.
What will happen then?
I told you.
One dies and you step in his place.
One of the nine
takes your place in your empty body.
If none gets into this body, it dies.
I mean, they find the body.
All right.
Then they found Ahmet's body.
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.
Wait a sec. Then I get into
the dead body closest to me, don't I?
Sort of. When there's a free bed,
the next client can go to sleep.
Then I can get into someone
that I killed.
- Hafize? Where are those teas?
- Coming right up Mr. Nevzad, coming.
Mr. Nevzad?
- Nevzad's gone. Don't yell.
What did you do?
You shot the woman!
- No, I didn't. I stepped into her.
- Who is this then?
In the name of Allah, the most
Gracious and most Compassionate.
- It must be our imam.
- Right. I know him. This is the imam.
He got into me too.
I saw him at home.
He came into me too.
Hey! I am a professor now.
No. You're a poet Mr. Fikri.
I am the professor here.
Agadoo-doo-doo,
push pineapple, shake the tree.
- This should be the singer.
- He's really nuts.
And down on the shore,
they gather romance.
She showed me much more,
not only to dance.
Let him go away then.
What is this now?
Mr. Nevzad!
I was bringing your teas but...
Mrs. Hafize's with us too.
I'm beginning
to get sick of all this.
Agadoo-doo-doo,
push pineapple, shake the tree.
- Mr. Fikri?
- Professor?
Oui.
Only, wait a minute...
Ahmet is dead, Oya told me.
A brain haemorrhage.
Who's this Oya? Nosy shit.
Fuck that. Still, Ahmet died and
I stepped into his body.
Then Alper Canan died
and zoom, I slip in.
Then Burak. As I got into him,
he was run over by a car.
So far so good.
- Yes.
But last...
Mrs. Hamiyet was shot and died.
But instead of Mrs. Hamiyet...
...I found myself into Kurban Murat,
the triggerman. How is that?
I don't know.
There seems to be a problem.
So you say?
You need to solve this.
Before the sun sets.
You find Fikri, you kill him.
Thus your soul, regaining its body,
will be eased.
Or you must make sure
they won't kill Hamiyet.
Kill Fikri,
don't let them kill Hamiyet.
Exactly.
But I have no real control
over the situation...
...being dragged
from one body to another.
Then you can try another way.
That is oscillating in time.
Oscillating in time? What's that?
Until now you've wandered
from one body to another.
Now it won't be only in bodies but
also in time you'll wander.
What you've lived today...
...you can live over and over again
in different bodies.
And you will have the chance
to change the events. Got it?
Got it.
But how, Professor?
- Piece of cake.
Suicide!
I never thought about that.
If I kill myself...
Oscillating in time, I kill Fikri or
I hinder Hamiyet's murderers.
Then I oscillate in time.
Because I am the son of the sun.
And I will shove all
this stuff up your...
The king of guns is here.
Uh huh! Burak again!
Good. There's time.
What are you talking about, bro?
Look at this pistol.
Pistol... Pistol!
Kill Fikri.
What? Want me to kill Fikri?
Look. I surely don't have time
for explanations.
Saadet...
- Help me, God! Help me!
Enough with your gestures,
since we left the police station!
Kill Fikri.
- What took you so long?
- No time, Mr. Necati.
You don't understand anything,
but I've no time for explanations.
Fikri. Come on, kiss me Fikri.
Come on.
Saadet has sprung into action!
Come on, you too!
Fikri!
Fikri!
Saadet! Saadet!
What the hell
have you done to my wife?
You've killed my wife!
What did you do?
I didn't do it.
The demons did.
Fuck you and your demons!
No. Don't shoot.
Watch it! Don't you shoot me!
If you shoot me,
you'll get into Burak this time.
God knows where I could end up.
Don't do this!
Hey! Weren't you shot?
Couldn't you get into Burak?
Then who got shot?
Damn!
Mrs. Hamiyet's got shot again.
How was this possible?
Who the fuck are you? Who?
Yes. Mrs. Hamiyet died again,
and I am like this again.
Stupid, bloody whore!
She screws every single thing up.
No, no. This doesn't work.
I can not come to kill Fikri.
Then I must prevent Hamiyet's death.
Don't let them kill Hamiyet.
Don't let them kill Hamiyet.
Ahmet, let's go to the dining hall
for breakfast.
Ahmet...
We have only half an hour
before the class.
Breakfast? You and me?
Together? Breakfast?
No, I don't think so, thanks.
I had breakfast already, cheers.
Off you go now, I'll see you later.
Fine.
Don't let them kill Hamiyet.
Who killed Hamiyet?
Don't let them kill Hamiyet.
- How are you dear?
- And you?
- Fine. Well, there are lectures.
- Nope.
- What?
- No lectures today.
Today we walk around.
- Ahmet? Are you OK?
You will skip the class?
- Will do so today. Come on.
God! I thought I could do anything
with you. Wven, have a baby.
But I never thought of walking down
the park, hand in hand like this.
You sometimes need to do such things.
The spirit needs some fresh air, too.
You were going to watch
the eclipse through the telescope.
Did you?
- I've fully experienced that eclipse.
- Wonderful, wasn't it?
- Wonderful wouldn't be enough!
"The destiny has made me the
slave of a gazelle-eyed beauty. "
It's a poem by Yavuz Sultan Selim.
Do you really believe this stuff
about the eclipse affecting people?
Yes. It did affect me once.
You don't believe me, do you?
I can see inside everything.
For example, look.
I can see a wallet in the purse.
There's lipstick, blusher...
Come on.
Anybody could tell that.
- There's a gun as well.
- How do you know that?
Oya, what's the need of this?
Why do you carry this?
My dad gave this to me.
And it's licensed.
I'm sure it is.
But it seems dangerous to me.
The streets are dangerous Ahmet.
Oya, don't be afraid. I'm here.
Yes, you're here.
And it's good to know, but...
I'm worried about you, Oya.
But what if you use it
when you absolutely shouldn't?
- What will you do with it?
- I'll get rid of it. What else?
Look at the time. It's late.
Let's go and eat something.
I'd like one of those.
What about you?
Anything would be
fine for me, Burak.
- I'll give you the same, then.
- Isn't Necati in?
He's supposed to go
to a friend's wedding.
He's getting ready down there.
- You seem to come here often.
You know the waiters by their names.
- I'm acquinted with Mr. Necati.
As for the waiter,
didn't you see his name tag?
What happened Ahmet?
You look nervous.
No.
Ahmet, will you explain to me
why you talk such nonsense?
Fuck it! Where did you find it?
How did you find it?
Hands up!
Empty the cash box now!
What are you doing, bro?
Why aren't you at the register,
you moron?
- The boss hasn't left yet, stupid!
- What will happen now?
That's what will happen,
you brainless dog!
Shit! Mrs. Hamiyet is dead again.
Oya, don't be sad.
None of these has happened.
I am the son of the sun, you know.
And I oscillate in time nowadays.
I'll be seeing you around.
Fuck you, son of the sun!
We couldn't do this.
And we couldn't do that either.
Kill Hamiyet. Kill her.
You're dead meat Hamiyet.
Hamiyet... You're dead!
At five p. M, you should bring her
to the place that I tell you.
Look where we ended up!
No. The place that I tell you.
This guy acts like a dumbass.
I hope he won't be a trouble.
If he makes trouble,
I will make trouble as well.
And if I make trouble,
that means serious trouble! Got it?
Got it, for my part.
Þule, this guy there,
is an asshole all along.
I've worked everybody out
but him.
Enough, Alper! I've been sick of this
weirdness of yours since morning.
All right, don't get mad.
I'm going.
Take care of Cahide.
Make sure she stays home.
We'll need her in a few hours.
I mean this guy.
OK. By the way...
I'm under your spell.
It's all because of you
but I'm under your spell anyway.
God, this guy is mad.
- I need to see your boss Mr. Necati.
- The boss has gone to a wedding.
A wedding? Screw that wedding!
Understood?
Screw it big time!
Ahmet! Ahmet!
Burak! Burak!
Please. Let us...
There you go,
another ambulance!
- How are you Mrs. Hamiyet?
- Fine.
Mrs. Hamiyet, there's something
strange about you.
Wach time I try to change events
I dispose of this gun...
...and this stupid Serkan comes up
with it and shoots you.
I even tried to shoot myself to get
a chance to get back into myself.
No. You got shot again.
Every time you come in my way and
you manage to get yourself killed.
Are you stupid or what Mrs. Hamiyet?
- I think you should see a doctor.
No. I want to take my chance with you
one more time.
In the neighbourhood, everyone but me
has killed you at least once.
I may be freed this time.
Would you mind
if I blew your brains out?
It didn't work out again.
We keep shootin her, but somehow
it doesn't work, for God's sake!
Professor?
- Oui.
So you got into Burak.
Is it comfortable at least?
At least I'm a waiter now.
You're still a killer.
I couldn't solve
this Hamiyet problem.
I've been coming and going,
but I'm still here!
This is no good.
You've run into a paradox.
If you can't solve this problem
before the sun sets...
I'll keep on roaming.
Even worse.
You'll get imprisoned in a mummy.
What?
The Ancient Egyptians knew all of
what we've been going through.
And I was wondering who was missing
from this story.
Those ancient fucking Egyptians!
So?
The Egyptians planned a purgatory
for those of their wandering souls.
Some kind of waiting lounge.
Mummies.
Bodies without a soul.
If some soul ever remains disembodied
for some time...
...it goes and gets into a mummy and
waits for the forthcoming eclipse.
To be correct,
for the forthcoming "total eclipse".
If lucky, it can get out of it.
If not, it remains there for eternity
yelling "agadoo-doo-doo".
That's of course for souls
that were not chosen by sun.
No, no. I'm not going to
give in to life or time, this time.
This time, I'm making the decisions.
The wisest mistake
anyone could ever make...
- And what's that?
- Arrogance.
Arrogance you said?
Can you explain a bit?
Yes, arrogance, man.
You think you know everything better.
You're sure you'll win every time
in the end.
You don't care whatsoever
about others' lives.
They exist, so that you can exist.
So that you can live a better life.
And even they upset you so much
that you could say to yourself:
"The less they are, the better. "
That's why you're always ready to
rumble in a sick, challenging mood.
And to achieve your target,
you tell lies on and on.
And those lies pile up so much
that...
...sometimes you even
believe yourself.
And in time, it'll be impossible
for you to fool yourself.
And then,
you remain with one more need:
Another you
that would not be like yourself.
For example, a woman.
Hello?
Come to Taksim and pick me up.
Tell them to come to the same place
where we met this morning.
They say that when one gets older,
he comes to a better understanding.
I would like to
confess you something:
I am Fikri Þemsigil and
I feel just like that.
All my life I've been waiting
for a miracle.
As the saying goes,
something supernatural.
But I sank so deep
into this miracle that...
...only the reality
could set me free from the miracle.
I've understood this.
The value of reality!
In the name of Allah, the most
Gracious and the most Compassionate.
Oh dear God.
What happened, Imam?
Came back to the poet
after some wandering?
Haven't the demons left yet?
- Don't ask. He insists on demons.
No problem. He's got an imam inside.
He'll leave soon.
You never know, though.
This imam got into me too.
Although at that moment
I was someone else.
What?
Þule, today there is no one left
I haven't come in and out of.
It's only you I haven't got into.
And it's my sole regret.
- Mr. Kurban!
- Mr. Kurban dies for you. Tell me.
Cahide is here now.
Should we go?
Yes. But for now.
I have this feeling inside that
we'll meet again.
How are you Mrs. Cahide?
Are you OK?
I'm not well. Why did they bring me
here? Why have they gone off?
What are you going to do to me?
Look, Mrs. Cahide. You better
go away for some time, will you?
But how can I?
Take this.
There's a good deal of money here.
You take the first plane
to the South.
The biggest lie I have ever heard is
that truth is relative!
As if truth is relative to
individual.
They say that beliefs of each person
are shaped by his perception.
However, the important thing is
not the way we perceive...
...it is the object of
our perception.
Let's think about a man.
As soon as you think that
the man is stupid...
...because you perceive him as
stupid, you are deep in hubris.
You know how I learned all this?
I am that man.
And I'm not stupid.
Only I can't think
as quickly as you do.
It could be due to my age.
People, especially women,
tend to hide their age.
But it's not the fear of aging,
it's the fear of death.
And if you kill people
for a living...
...you fear the most.
Or should I say
you fear getting killed?
Well, let's say getting killed.
We can't do anything
against the fear of death.
But what I've been through since
this morning, taught me that...
...those who fear getting killed
can only do one thing:
Imprison themselves.
For example, you can
lock yourself in a room.
Or you can hire an army of
bodyguards and hide behind them.
But if you want to be free
as well as secure...
...I can suggest you
only one prison:
Yourself.
A doctor friend of mine explained
this to me:
When you're horrified, you firstly
flee towards your own self.
You'll rapidly create a universe of
your own in which you start living.
He also said: "Man is an animal
which gets bored quickly.
In time,
he'll start feeling lonely.
And as he sinks into himself, he'll
create more and more people.
He'll start communicating with them,
then he'll argue with them...
...until he starts quarrelling
with them. "
I asked, what would he do then?
He said: "He runs outside. "
But as another person.
Which means,
there was no real Mrs. Hamiyet.
Mrs. Hamiyet was the shield of the
hired killer Kurban Murat...
...madly afraid of getting killed.
Here is the mystery of Hamiyet's
Paradox that doomed my life.
Alper.
Stay here.
I'll go get myself some stuff, OK?
Don't go anywhere.
And forget about those demon stories!
In the name of Allah, the most
Gracious and the most Compassionate.
There's no god but Allah
and Muhammad is His messenger.
Boy, what a dishonourable imam.
Is it still in?
Don't feel bad, I'll help you.
Because I've figured this trick out.
At the end of our conversation,
my doctor friend said:
"Fikri, don't stress yourself. Relax.
Live the way you like.
Don't imprison your soul
in your ego.
The soul is something real complex.
It won't die that easily. "
"That's why" said he...
..."Do not fear death. "
There is no god but Allah...
"Because whoever fears death,
also fears life.
And fear wears your soul out. "
There is no god but Allah...
Alper. Stay here.
I'll go get myself some stuff, OK?
Don't go anywhere.
And forget about those demon stories!
Þule, don't go.
There's no need.
Alper, are you feeling better?
Have the demons gone yet?
Nights take you to me,
riding like the wind.
Days, bleeding wounds in my heart!
Alper, I thought you went insane.
Thank God, you came to.
Wait a second. I'll be back.
The further we move away, the better.
- Are we fugitives?
- Duh!
Forget it. No need.
Let's go and watch the sunset.
We both could do with
some romance.
- Do you believe in giants?
- Giants?
Yes. You know the ones
from the fairy tales.
Those evil creatures
100 times as big as a man.
There were two of these giants,
husband and wife, sitting at home.
The husband got hungry and said:
"Woman! Prepare some food for me. "
And the wife
was a champion in laziness.
She took a package of crackers in the
kitchen and gave it to her husband.
The package was full of humans.
The husband opened it,
asking his wife: "What are these?"
The wife said:
"No-No crackers. "
"No-No crackers? What does that
mean?" mumbled the man-giant.
He took a couple of man-crackers
and threw them in his mouth.
At that moment, the crackers yelled:
"No! No!"
This is how life is Þule. One day
you're invited to a banquet...
...and then you find out that
your name is on the menu.
Look... Did you know
Marilyn Monroe had six toes?
- Which means Norma was abnormal?
- Who's Norma?
Norma Jean Baker.
Her real name.
I didn't know that.
Did you know that
Second World War is over?
Me and my ways of making an idiot of
myself! I should make a list someday.
Don't brood over this.
We're only talking about a dead man.
The dead surely don't mind
being talked behind their backs.
And the pulse of the dead
beats fast.
I learned that the hard way.
You're talking nonsense, Alper.
Real nonsense.
The bigger the bullshit,
the bigger the audience.
You're actually a nice girl. How
come you wanted someone to die?
Back to this, are we? We've been
over this 50 times, Alper.
Cahide doesn't want a divorce.
But I can't give birth to this baby,
unless I marry you.
So you're pregnant!
What does this mean now?
Yet I did take you here to kill you.
Alper, what's this all about
for God's sake?
It's about me being
at the end of the road.
As I can't go back to
my former self...
...I thought I could at least become
the very thing that I wanted to have.
And that's you, missy.
Alper, have the demons
come back again?
Nothing has come, don't worry.
But if you're pregnant...
I can't kill you.
Do you know why?
Because I'm not ready
to be a mother yet.
But before I leave,
do you mind doing me one last favor?
One last thing for me?
All right, I'll do it.
Once. Only once, would you tell me
that you love me?
"I love you. "
Tell me, damn it!
- I love you, OK?
Liar!
Getting old
certainly is a miracle.
But I know one thing
that is even greater a miracle.
That is the death.
Because life,
being a thing that begins...
...has to be a thing that ends
as well.
Just think about the best sex
you've ever had.
The best food you've ever eaten.
The best ball game you've ever seen.
If any of those hadn't ended and
were lasting still...
...it would certainly not be
the best, but the most boring.
Life is that way too.
If it doesn't end at some point,
it becomes a real plague.
Thank God, death exists...
...putting all the things in life
into their proper places.
As the saying goes,
long live death.
- I brought your teas Mr. Necati.
- Agadoo-doo-doo.
Mr. Nevzad, please help us!
- This is extraordinary!
- Certainly so.
This footage will shock
the whole world of science.
Souls imprisoned into mummies!
Like a miracle.
Do you think
we should make this public?
I'm not sure Mr. Fikri. People are
not ready for such a thing.
But, Professor, they must gradually
get used to it.
Have you been able to
get used to it?
I have difficulties,
most of the time.
Especially as your house is
really damp.
But my salary is not bad,
is it, Mr. Fikri?
Not bad, yes.
And the conferences abroad
aren't bad either.
You're lucky this year's program
will be quite a busy one.
My biggest dream for retirement
has been to see the world.
At least this will come true.
But you've no idea how much
I'd wish to do it with Saadet.
I used to wonder if I could spare
some time and get married some day.
Fikri, I'm here. Let's go home.
Let's go Saadet.
Of course, please go.
There's still the dinner to prepare.
Fikri can also make a lovely salad.
Oh Saadet,
I'm madly in love with you.
Or else I would never endure
this ordeal.
But whatever happens, don't
let that guy get lucky with you.
