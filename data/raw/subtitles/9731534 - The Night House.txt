I appreciate it.
I know that your
relatives are scattered.
We'd be happy
to come back.
Are you sure
you'll be all right?
Yes. I'll be fine.
Thank you.
I fly back to Detroit tonight.
I'll get in late,
but call me if you
need to. Anytime.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. I'll be okay.
Okay. I know you will.
Take care, sweetheart.
I will. Bye.
So, raise your hand
if you have better taste
in music than the groom.
Do I see any hands?
All right, yeah,
I see a few.
What we're looking
at here are the EOCT scores.
Now, I'm gonna pick on
10th grade just a little bit
because you'll see
the biggest difference there.
The yellow line, the mustardy
one, that's two years ago.
The blue is last year.
The pink is this year.
Beth is here.
Give her space.
The pink is this year.
So, what happened?
Teacher-student ratio.
I know, but class sizes
are what they are. It's statewide.
We can't play the blame game
when we're pulling up the rear...
Sorry.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I don't think you had to come.
No one would blame you.
I still have
grades to enter.
I'd have done that for you.
All you had to do is ask.
It's all right.
It gives me something to do.
For now, anyway.
We don't
wanna be that school.
You holdin' up?
I don't want
to be that principal.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just didn't really
sleep well last night.
Can't believe you slept at all.
Especially there.
We got to
show up for them.
Okay.
I promised to give you all
a 10-minute break,
so let's go ahead and take that.
Go potty, stretch your legs.
There are more donuts in the back,
courtesy of Mountville Baptist
Church, so get you some,
and be back by 8:40 though,
on the dot-ish.
Mrs. Parchin?
Hi.
Sorry. I was just...
Excuse me.
I tried to knock, but...
We met before.
Um, I'm Hunter's mom.
- Hunter...
- McLaughlin.
He has you
second period.
I'm Becky McLaughlin.
It was a few months ago.
Right. Of course.
I... I have so many Hunters
this year.
- Oh. How many?
- Hmm?
Students named Hunter
do you have?
Mm... Three.
Please, have a seat.
I'm sure you know
why I'm here.
I checked the website.
Hunter got a C in speech.
Oh, right. I think so.
Uh... Let me check.
- But that's what it said.
- Mm-hmm.
Let me see here.
Uh... Right, yes.
It looks like he didn't do
his last presentation.
He said that you told him
he could make that up.
I did.
Yeah. He, uh...
He didn't.
He said he came in
last Thursday.
That was
the last day of school.
He said that
you weren't here.
Yes, I was out for a few days.
It was a personal matter.
Well, he told me he was out the
day you presented those projects.
We all have personal matters
to deal with sometimes.
Okay. Uh...
You know what?
Let's just excuse him
from that assignment.
Uh...
There. B.
That's not what I wanted.
Then, uh, what did you want?
Excuse me?
When you came in here,
what did you want?
I want to know
why my son...
My husband shot himself
in the head last Thursday.
I hadn't heard.
No, because
it's a personal matter.
So, yeah.
Yeah. If you wanna know,
he took the boat out
on the lake.
He took a handgun that I
didn't even know that we owned.
And pow!
Right in the mouth.
So, which Hunter
got what grade
on what high school elective
speech class assignment,
it really doesn't matter
to me right now.
So, you want a B,
you got a B.
I... I apologize.
Oh, you want an A?
All right. Ta-da!
A B is fine.
B it is.
Anything else
I can do for you?
No.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry
for your loss.
- Oh. Hey, Mel.
- Hey.
The sky was looking
a little mean.
I went ahead and covered the boat for
you, just in case.
You didn't have to do that.
Ah, that's a goddamn lie
if I've ever heard one.
Just paying it back, that's all.
You and Owen were a couple
godsends when Shelly passed.
Thank you.
You want me to haul
that thing away?
You just say the word.
It's okay.
I think I'll leave it.
Sell it with the house.
You thinking
about selling?
Maybe.
I mean, he built it,
so I'd hate to leave it, but...
Yeah.
It's peaceful out here,
but it is lonely.
Hey, Mel, were you, uh,
shooting this morning
around 7:30 or so?
Didn't hear anything?
There was a gunshot.
I just figured with
the weather getting warmer
and snakes and all...
I see a copperhead
near the house,
I'm sure gonna shoot it,
but I didn't today.
Right.
You hear it again,
just give me a shout, okay?
- Okay, I will.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get back.
- Mm-hmm.
So, this is going to be
the office down here,
and over here
will be the kitchen.
Or maybe it's here.
And then...
And then over here we have,
uh...
...biceps. Lots of biceps.
So, that is the husband.
Oh, hey, Owen!
How are you doing?
Are you working?
You know that we're paying
people to do that, right?
You don't have to
do it all yourself.
Mm-hmm.
No, no, don't worry,
I'm not actually filming.
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.
Well,
unless you want me to.
Let me check.
No. Stop.
Come here.
Who is this?
Beth...
Owen? Is...
I know that you can...
I can't hear you.
I can't...
Yes, you can.
Look out the window.
What am I looking at?
You tell me.
It's a picture of you.
Is it?
Yeah.
I mean, nice blouse.
Look... Look closer.
Is that me?
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, who else would it be?
That's what
I want to know.
Well, it's either you
or a woman who looks,
like, a lot like you.
Sweetie,
I think that's you.
Nice blouse, right?
I don't have one like that.
God, Beth.
Don't do this to yourself.
It's you, okay?
And if it's not you,
then, believe me,
there are far worse things to
find on your husband's phone
than fully clothed women
who look exactly like you.
Mm. Yeah, well,
I guess I was his type.
Please. Owen loved you.
You. He worshipped you.
I...
I mean, from everything
you told me,
you didn't really give him
any reason to roam.
I mean, how do you know he even
took those pictures anyway?
He's not here to defend
himself or explain.
Look, a bunch of us are
going out tonight drinking.
The whole department.
Well, not Clark, obviously,
but you should come.
Get your mind off things.
We'll see.
Why were you going through
his phone anyway?
Shit.
Sorry.
That was... That was
a really fucking stupid,
insensitive thing to say.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think we had secrets.
Everybody has secrets.
Don't let it weigh on you.
Just...
Just remember
your Owen.
Who you fell
in love with.
Because whatever else he was,
he was that, too.
What's her name?
Maggie Monroe.
Oh, she'd be
my best customer.
She told me I don't have a
knack for teaching anyway.
And she'd know
'cause she's an expert
on many things.
Jesus Christ.
So, are we going
to read the book she gave us?
Fuck, no. I don't need
300 pages to tell me
how to "engage and inspire"
my students.
Yeah, just let them stand up
on their desks or whatever.
Change their lives.
You okay, B?
Do you guys
believe in ghosts?
Uh...
Ghosts, like, how?
I do. I believe.
- Really?
- Well, I mean, I don't not believe.
I think there's something
in my house.
Like a... a presence.
No way.
I mean,
I don't know.
I feel like
there's something.
Like there's something
watching me.
And all this weird stuff.
I'm having
these dreams.
I mean, it feels like
they're dreams.
They feel real though
when they're happening.
Like sleep paralysis?
No.
Do you know
what sleep paralysis is?
Yes, Gary, I know
what sleep paralysis is.
I don't.
It's when your mind's
awake, but your body's not, right?
Did you guys see
that documentary on...
I had this buddy
in school who had it.
It's pretty common to feel like there's
someone else in the room with you
when you're
having an episode.
Like a hostile presence.
What about the opposite?
Like a
friendly presence?
No. When your body's awake,
but your mind isn't.
But isn't that
just sleepwalking?
Sure. Sleepwalking.
Could that be contagious?
No. Why?
Owen used to sleepwalk.
I remember that.
A year or two after he built the
house, it just started.
Now you're doing it?
Yeah.
That's weird.
How long were you married?
Uh... Oh.
Let me do the math.
Fourteen years.
This next one,
this next one would have been 15.
Wow.
You were married young.
Little bit. Little bit.
I mean, you spend
so much time
in the same space
with someone,
it's gonna feel like
they're there.
Even when they're not.
But who knows, right?
I mean, who's to say
what happens once we
"shuffle off this mortal coil,
what dreams may come"?
No. No Shakespeare
until next fall.
Are you really gonna cheer me
up with the suicide soliloquy?
Fuck. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I didn't...
I'm so sorry.
I'm joking.
I'm joking.
You shouldn't be
joking about that.
Heather...
Oh...
Did you seriously not know
that anything was wrong?
Gary!
Jesus, you guys...
No, I don't mind.
No, I didn't know.
I'm the one who struggled
with that stuff. Depression.
Dark thoughts.
He's the one that
kept them at bay.
Maybe it got to him.
I don't know.
Maybe I infected him with my bullshit.
No, no. It...
- It doesn't work like that.
- No?
Did he leave a note?
Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- She wants to talk about it.
I think we're done
with this conversation.
He did.
Beth...
He did.
God.
You keep it in your purse?
Okay.
"You were right.
"There is nothing.
"Nothing is after you.
"You're safe now."
That's it.
That's it?
That's it.
No "XOXO,
your loving husband."
Nothing.
What does that mean?
Not a clue.
Not a fucking clue.
Other than I was living
with a crazy person
and didn't know it.
Makes you wonder though,
doesn't it?
What else didn't I know?
I want to know.
Okay. I think that it's
time we get you home.
Sure. I mean,
I wouldn't wanna keep him waiting.
Okay.
Let's go.
Okay, fine, let's go.
Good night, guys.
Thank you.
- Okay.
- Let's go. I got you.
Wow, you've really made
some progress on the place.
Mm-hmm.
You want a brandy?
No, Beth.
I don't want a brandy.
- And I don't want you to have one either.
- Okay.
I don't even
like it that much.
Haven't acquired
the taste.
Come on,
upstairs with you.
No. I'm sleeping here.
Okay. Do you
want me to stay?
Mm-mm. You've got kids.
It's fine.
I could just...
I can call Bob.
I told him I was gonna be out late.
I could just
call him and...
No. Mm-mm.
Well, you should
come over soon.
For dinner or something.
I'll get Bob to cook for us.
I don't like you here
all by yourself.
I lied.
About the letter.
You asshole!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you totally has us going.
I thought that was real.
Did you see Gary's face?
It is real.
I meant that I lied about
having no idea what it meant.
You know, I...
I died back in Tennessee.
Did I tell you that story?
Mm-mm.
Seventeen, high school.
Friend was driving,
and we flipped
over the side of a mountain.
Pancaked.
Lungs were crushed.
They had to airlift me out.
Heart stopped.
Whole deal. Four minutes.
Oh, my God.
Afterward, when everyone would
ask me when they found out,
like, "What was it like?
What did you see?"
And I didn't want to disappoint
them, so I'd say...
"I don't know.
I don't remember."
But I remember.
Owen was the only person
I ever told.
There's nothing.
What do you mean,
"Nothing"?
I wish I could
tell you something.
A light at the end
of the tunnel.
There's just tunnel.
If it's any consolation,
Owen was never convinced.
Yeah, we agreed about
most things, but not that.
Not what comes after.
He wanted to believe in a better place.
And he almost
made me believe it, too.
But you can't unknow
what you know.
"You were right.
There is nothing.
"Nothing is after you.
"You're safe now."
He told me I was right.
Now I'm not so sure.
He said you were safe.
Safe from what?
I guess we'll never know,
will we, Claire?
Do you
really believe in ghosts?
No.
I was just being nice.
Mm.
You are.
You're very, very nice.
Sure you don't
want me to stay?
Maybe just till I go to sleep.
Beth.
Beth. Wake up.
The door.
Beth, wake up.
Claire?
The door.
You wanna say something?
Talk to me!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
What?
Wait! No! No!
The boat.
What did you say?
The boat.
Owen?
Are you really here?
If you're with me, show me.
Is that really you?
It's a dream.
You're dreaming.
Beth?
Hey.
What are you doing out here?
Taking a hike?
Uh, no. No,
I'm just looking for something.
Can I help?
Uh-uh.
What you looking for?
Uh... A house.
- A house?
- Mm-hmm.
No houses out here.
It's all county forest land.
Can't build on it.
Right. I'm just being silly.
I thought I saw something
last night, like a...
Looked like a light
in a window, so...
A house?
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, it's doing me good
to get some air.
So, if you don't mind...
As a matter of fact,
I do.
Sorry, what?
You're not well, Beth.
You've been through a lot lately.
More than you deserve.
And for my own peace of
mind, if nothing else,
I'd rather not have you tromping around
out here in the woods on your own.
You should be with your
friends and family.
Do you have anybody?
Hey. How about
my place for lunch?
- I'll make sandwiches.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Maybe in a little while
though, okay?
Anyone here?
Mel?
Mel?
Hold on!
Okay.
- What the fuck is this?
- What?
What the fuck is this?
How should I know?
Bullshit. You were trying to
keep me out of the woods.
Because I'm worried
about you.
- What was he building?
- What?
There is a house.
Our house. My house.
Now, what the fuck
was he building?
I don't know.
I never saw a house.
I only saw him wandering
around out there
in the middle of the night
from time to time.
What? And you
didn't tell me?
He asked me not to.
Mel.
Look, Beth...
I don't think you're equipped
to handle this right now.
Oh.
Tell me everything
that you know.
I caught him once.
Like I caught you
this morning.
Taking that same route
around the lake.
He had a woman with him.
I thought it was you, so I called
out, and when she turned...
It wasn't.
No.
He came by that night.
Pounding at my door. Late.
In a real bad way.
Alcohol on his breath. Mud on his
hands and clothes, like he'd fallen.
And I know
how it sounds now,
but I believed
every word he said.
And? What did he say?
That he had urges.
Shameful urges...
that he was rightfully ashamed
of, that he was trying to shake.
Said he'd found a way
to keep them at bay.
What kind of urges?
You'll forgive me if I
didn't feel the need to ask.
Look. Don't think I haven't
wrestled with this, okay?
But I swear
on Shelly's grave
that I never saw anything
like that again. Ever.
I wanted to tell you
so many times...
but he just seemed
good after that.
You both seemed so good.
Well, I guess you were wrong.
He left a hole
in your life
and you're desperate to fill it.
That's what this is.
Look, if...
All I can say is that,
if I'm allowed to say anything,
is that you don't need to
fill it with something dark.
You're closer to death
than you've ever been.
Well, that's not
exactly true.
Okay.
Come back.
Come back...
Just one sec.
I'm not actually buying these.
I just have a quick question.
Uh, my husband
bought these from you,
and I'm just wondering
if you could tell me
whether he bought
anything else,
or whether he had something on hold?
Something like that?
Um, we don't really
keep records like that.
Okay. Could you
tell me when?
When he bought these?
Maybe you have
an inventory?
- Not like that.
- Right.
Could you tell me other books
by this author?
Tsk.
Let's see...
It's Dyson.
Think you probably want
Sturgis, but okay...
Hi.
Hi.
You work here?
I do. Can I help you
with anything?
Mm-mm.
I'm Beth.
Beth Parchin.
Madelyne.
I think
you knew my husband.
- No, I don't...
- Owen. Owen Parchin.
There are pictures
of you on his phone.
Jonah?
It's all right. You don't
have to call for help.
I'm not gonna...
I mean...
the matter's been resolved...
I guess.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
He's dead.
What?
Suicide.
Oh, my God.
Just in case you had
any dates planned, or...
Mm-mm.
- It wasn't like that.
- Oh.
Well, then would you mind
telling me what it was like?
Sure. Um...
He came in
a few times every year,
and he was always friendly.
We flirted some,
and he started coming more after that.
We had a few drinks,
and that was it.
Take your hair down.
- What?
- Your hair. Ponytail.
Lose it. Take it down.
Why?
Well, because you slept with my
husband, and I'm asking you nicely.
I didn't...
I didn't sleep
with him.
Honestly, I barely knew him.
For centuries,
stories of the...
She said she barely
fucking knew him.
What did you say?
Same. I said,
"Same here, kid."
Do you believe her?
What? About them
not fucking?
Yeah.
I do.
Well, that's something.
Nothing good.
I mean, fucking, I get.
Fucking makes sense.
There were others.
Our neighbor saw him with someone.
Really?
Yes. And I looked
on his computer,
and there are
tons of pictures,
like half a dozen women.
They all look a little bit like
me, but not quite.
So if he wasn't
fucking them,
what the hell
was he doing?
I had this dream
the other night.
It was our house, but not.
It was backwards,
and I saw him
with someone...
Stop. Stop it.
Stop going
through his stuff.
Nothing you find
is gonna help you right now.
Am I not being clear?
He had a secret life.
Are you really gonna
stand there and lecture me
about his posthumous right
to privacy?
I understand you're
experiencing these things,
but I'm worried
about you.
Maybe take a step back.
I don't know.
I felt him.
I felt my husband.
"You were right.
There's nothing."
Why would he say there's nothing?
He didn't believe that.
Beliefs change.
Look at you.
You're the most
skeptical person I know,
and here you are,
telling me that your house is haunted.
Yeah, I mean,
when you put it like that,
it does sound kinda silly.
Don't go home.
Get away from the lake
for a while.
You can
stay here, even.
You can stay
as long as you want.
It's not finished.
Not everything gets finished.
You may never know
what he was thinking.
He's gone.
You're not.
You still have a life to live.
No, you're right.
I could use the distance.
I'll go pack a few more things.
Get a bag.
Book into a room
for a couple nights.
- I can't tell if you're being serious.
- I am.
And you've made some
excellent points. Really.
I love you.
Just call me later, okay?
I will.
I'm leaving.
Tonight, I guess.
So, if you've got something to say to
me, you better say it now.
You hear me?
Motherfucker.
Hey!
Sorry.
I didn't think you were home.
I'm home.
I don't think
I should be here.
How did you know
where to go?
Well, I've been here before.
I probably should have told
you earlier at the bookstore,
but, uh, honestly,
you freaked me out a little.
Sorry about that.
No, I get it. Totally.
I probably would have
done the same thing.
It's funny, really,
I laid down for a
minute after work,
and I had this dream.
I dreamed I was you.
Well, I was me,
but I was you, too,
and something was chasing you,
and it was all around you.
Well, us.
But did it get us?
I'm not sure.
That's when I woke up.
Afterwards,
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I figured there's something
you should know.
- Stuff that happened.
- Phew.
I told you I didn't sleep
with your husband.
Yeah, you can use his name.
He wasn't "my husband" to you.
Right.
Well, I meant it.
I didn't sleep with him.
But I would have.
I thought we would, but...
He came by one afternoon
after I was getting off,
and he invited me here,
like a... like a day trip.
And normally,
I wouldn't have gone,
but he was smart,
and sweet, and...
I don't know. I just kind of
felt safe with him, you know?
I do.
Right.
So, yeah, um,
he took me here
and, uh, we had a drink.
We walked to the lake,
and he showed me the other house...
Wait. You've seen it?
Well, it's not much to see,
but he was really proud of it, though.
I mean, giddy, almost.
Showing me around
from room to room.
And then, he showed me this weird
statue, and he asked me to hold it.
And you did?
What exactly did he
do to you?
Nothing.
He held me...
sort of.
He put his chin
on my shoulder and...
Look, I know it sounds weird
saying it out loud,
but at the time,
it felt really nice.
Having someone
close to you.
Feeling them there.
I...
I felt him shake.
And he was crying a little,
and I didn't know what to do.
What did he do to you?
I kissed him.
He kissed me back and...
It was very sweet at first.
So, I... I...
didn't stop him when he
put his hands on my back.
And I didn't stop him when
he put his hands on my neck.
Until he
started squeezing.
Oh, my God.
I probably misread him,
you know? I just...
Everybody has a different
barometer for that kind of thing.
Did he hurt you?
God, no!
I asked him to stop,
and he stopped.
But do you think
he would have?
But he didn't.
He drove me home.
He said it was his fault,
not mine.
That he was
tired and confused,
and he didn't know
what was him,
and it wasn't
working anymore.
He was afraid
he couldn't hold it back.
Hold what back?
I don't know exactly.
But in the end,
he said he knew
what he had to do.
He had to end it
for good.
Look...
I just wanted to tell you.
He clearly felt guilty
about cheating on you.
That's what he was
talking about, right?
We need to talk.
I'm not leaving until we do.
You called, I came.
Don't you wanna talk to me?
You talked to her.
I'm here. I'm still here.
Wherever you are...
come and get me.
Just come get me!
Okay.
Fucking...
Okay. Okay.
Come on, pick up the phone.
Claire Woodward...
Fuck!
...is not available.
At the tone,
please record your message.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's, uh... it's late.
And, uh...
I should have listened to you.
I did something
that I shouldn't have.
I went across the lake,
and I saw something.
I saw something so...
I don't even know
if it's real or not.
I know my husband.
I know who he is,
and I refuse to believe
that he would have...
I don't know.
I wish that you were here.
I wish that it were morning.
No.
Stop it.
Owen?
Where are you?
I just...
I don't understand.
Please come back.
Oh, God.
I miss you so much.
Is this real?
Are you really here?
Hold me. Hold me.
You're really here?
Yes.
I'm here.
Owen?
No.
I'm not Owen.
Fuck. Fuck.
No, stop it.
Hide.
What?
Owen?
You left.
What?
The night we met.
You're not Owen.
I'm what you felt
when your heart stopped.
No. I felt...
Nothing.
Do you remember?
You saw me.
And I've been
with you ever since.
What did you do
to my husband?
I went to him.
I whispered in his ear
over and over.
To send you back.
But he wouldn't.
He sent me them instead.
He tricked you.
For a while.
Shit.
Stop.
Don't fight.
No!
Beth.
Beth?
Hello?
Beth, are you here?
I'm coming up.
Beth?
Beth!
Where is he?
Gone.
But you already
knew that.
What the fuck?
Oh, my God.
Beth!
He thought
he could protect you.
He was wrong.
You were right.
Beth!
Beth!
There is nothing.
Beth!
There is only me.
Come back to me.
Beth!
It doesn't matter.
Let go.
Come back to me.
Beth!
Beth!
Oh, my God.
I'm right here.
Keep your head up.
This way.
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.
What happened?
- I don't know.
- I don't know.
Beth? Are you here?
Are you here?
I'm here, I'm here.
I'm here.
I got you.
I'm here.
I got you, I got you.
I'm right here.
I'm here.
Just breathe.
You're safe now.
You're okay,
you're gonna be okay.
What is it?
There's nothing there.
I know.
