Then let's use it.
Okay.
Nephew, listen, the more you speak
English, the better you get.
After all,
you're in the USA now.
Thanks for staying an extra week.
Of course. You're my uncle.
Wow, this place looks wonderful.
Of course, this is Manhattan.
Is your supermarket near?
I can only dream
about having a market here.
No.
My market's in the Bronx.
Stop that kid!
Looks like a really tough area.
Something's always happening here.
That's New York for you.
You'll get used to it.
Honey, I'm home.
She must be at the market.
Uncle, this place is huge.
3000 square feet. If I brought it back
to Hong Kong, I'd be set for life.
Yes, look at my pictures.
See?
I have pictures of everyone.
Here, the whole family.
Your father too.
He's winning a tournament.
He won every tournament...
...like you do now.
We were inseparable.
But I came to America and stayed...
...almost 30 years.
Oh, I miss my family.
I'll get ready and
we'll go down to the market.
You can meet
your future auntie there, okay?
Hey, Uncle, you still practice?
That old thing?
Your dad gave it to me...
...otherwise, I'd have used it
for firewood a long time ago.
I see you kept up.
Just sometime.
Hi, Danny.
Hi, Uncle Bill.
Very good.
- My nephew from Hong Kong, Keung.
- Keung. Good moves.
- You're number one.
- Keung is the Hong Kong champion.
My neighbor, Danny Chan.
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- I'm going.
Let's take him to the bus.
Bye, Danny.
Be sure to study hard.
Let's go.
Danny, this is for you.
- For me?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Don't play with it in class.
Okay, bye.
- What was that?
- I gave him my old video game.
The poor kid.
He has a hard life.
His only sister neglects him.
Here. My life's work. I'm seeing a
buyer today. I plan to sell and retire.
Really?
- Then why are you painting this place?
- Well....
Fresh paint makes it look better.
I can impress my buyer.
Why haven't they painted that side yet?
You go in first, I'll go look.
- May I help you with something?
- I'm Keung.
- Keung?
- I'm Bill's nephew.
- You just arrived.
- Yes, I just got in.
A small gift for my future auntie.
Not everyone is your aunt. She's Mrs.
Chung, here to help with the wedding.
- Excuse me.
- My nephew.
Honey!
This is your nephew.
Oh, so you're Keung.
I've heard so much about you.
Honey....
Has the champagne arrived?
Don't worry. Everything'll be okay.
Go ask Tina.
Tina....
The champagne was delivered
this morning.
Hey, what's up?
- Surprised to see your future auntie?
- A little.
Hey, what can I say to you?
Welcome to America. This aunt
of yours, she is a great woman.
Hi, Mr. Chu.
Walter, I'm on my way.
Go give your aunt a hand, okay?
Hey, Walter.
- This is my client...
- Oh, yeah?
...Elena. She's very interested
in seeing your market.
- Glad to meet you.
- Mr. Chu.
- How are you?
- Come in. Feel free to ask me anything.
All right.
We're the only market
within 7 or 8 blocks.
There's many regular customers.
That makes for great business.
Summer's our peak period.
Elena, this way, please.
- Please, have a seat.
- Thanks.
Something to drink?
Oh, no, thank you.
You have a one-way mirror.
A good boss must keep an eye
on everything. Right?
Here are my records.
Look at that.
I wish Uncle Bill had your muscle.
You're handsome too.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Why sell?
You're doing so well.
It's not Mr. Chu's idea.
His future wife wants to buy
a ranch after the wedding.
Breeding race horses, you know?
I know.
The price's too high.
Can't you come down?
Let me tell you...
I was offered three hundred
ninety thousand for it.
I'll give it to you now...
...for that price.
You like that?
Are you happy with that price?
Me? No.
It's 20% more than I thought.
Maybe we can do something.
Okay. 370,000.
Okay, then we have a deal.
- Sign to show you accept the offer.
- Here?
Yes, right there.
Uncle....
Meet my nephew, Keung.
- Keung. You just arrived?
- Yes.
- This is Walter Lau.
- There's a Stephen Lo outside.
He's brought a car.
Stephen Lo. I'll be there.
You can sign them for me.
I don't know.
You really should sign.
- It's standard procedure.
- Here you are.
Thank you.
Okay.
The deal is done.
Look at the walls around here.
They look so messy with that graffiti.
But my shop's clean. Everyone likes me,
so they spare the market.
- That's right.
- Stephen, I'll be a minute.
- No problem.
- Now we're in business...
...l must invite you
to my wedding tomorrow afternoon.
Walter knows where.
Come at one 1 :00.
- I'll see you there.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, Stephen.
Oh, my friend.
Wow, isn't that a great car?
Of course, it's an antique.
I told my boss I'm taking...
...the car for a tune-up.
Be careful.
I'll be careful. I'm picking up
my bride in it tomorrow.
- My nephew, Keung.
- We just met.
- Here, take this.
- I can't.
- This is old tradition. Take it!
- Thank you.
- Don't scratch it or anything.
- Relax. I'll treat it like my baby.
Double or nothing.
Let's see the dinero.
Thousand bucks.
Yeah, go.
Hey, Angelo....
Go.
Let's do it.
Uncle, your friend's car!
Come on, Nancy.
Come on. Uncle, wake up.
Go! Yeah!
This is my car.
Uncle!
Let me in. Open the door.
Uncle, I'm freezing my butt off.
Uncle!
Have a drink.
I've got one.
- I'm Keung.
- Yes, I heard yesterday.
Muscles Keung, right?
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
Congratulations, you bought the market.
Made my uncle's day.
- I'm happy too.
- If you need help, I'll stay longer.
Elena, thank you for coming.
Congratulations.
I've got some good news.
- Really?
- Keung says he will help.
- He did?
- Yes, every day next week.
Good, making yourself useful so soon.
- He's in good hands.
- Told you I'd take care of you.
Keung's the best. With him there,
I'll enjoy my honeymoon.
- Good.
- Hurry up. Everyone's waiting.
Call anytime, he'll be there.
Thanks for staying.
See you later.
I know what my schedule is this week.
We open at 6:30.
We have so much work to do.
- Keung!
- Wait.
What's going on?
He may have a girlfriend inside,
you know.
Already?
Let me get my pants.
Here's the last of the paperwork.
Give it to Elena.
Here's some spending money. See you
in a week. The apartment is yours.
- Have a nice time.
- Good for you, Keung.
Uncle, I'm coming.
It's okay. Bye! Have fun.
- The signed papers.
- Thank you.
The check.
- Thank you.
- This is the last...
- ...of the paperwork.
- Good.
Will I get a discount?
A discount?
My business is just starting.
When would you buy?
You're going back.
So, when do you leave?
When Uncle comes home from honeymoon,
we'll go back together.
Will you come back to visit?
Wait.
- He already stole some candy bars.
- This mirror's useful.
Oh, this guy's a jerk.
Don't worry...
...l'll make him pay for everything.
Hey, Nancy....
Anything else you want, babe?
No.
Angelo!
Don't worry. It's on me.
How much for this candy bar?
Fifty cents.
And these drinks?
What?
You drank them.
You want me to pay for this?
Why don't you drink it?
Try some.
What's this bitch saying?
- You stealing?
- What?
You say he's stealing?
Say it again.
What's up?
You got a problem?
Yo!
?Qu√© pasa?
What are you doing, man?
So, you're a tough guy?
No trouble.
I'm sorry.
I'm wrong.
The chocolate--
You shut up.
Don't hit me!
Don't go!
Did you see him?
I think he broke my nose.
Don't go!
Stealing? I'll teach you.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You tell the lady.
I'm sorry.
Say it in Chinese.
You should be sorry.
- My arm.
- Don't ever make trouble...
...or I'll beat you up each time.
Mind your step.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You okay?
Did they scare you?
- No, no.
- Good.
That was all right.
I can't believe it. It's, like...
Man, it was just great.
- Did they hurt you?
- No.
- You're amazing.
- How do you do that? It was like....
That's Chinese kung fu.
See you tomorrow.
- I'll see you later.
- Come on, Lisa, let's go.
- Can I help you?
- I have to learn to do it.
Thanks.
- I have you.
- I can't get down.
Of course not,
you're holding onto the ropes.
Okay.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- I need an electric gate.
- That'd be good.
Why don't you go inside?
I'll do it for you.
Hey, Keung....
You left your things.
You forgot this.
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.
- I forgot to pay for these.
- Don't worry, it's a protection fee.
Then I should take more.
- Then I'll have to charge you.
- Hurry, lock it.
The spring's broken.
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye.
- Hey there, sugar, you want a date?
- No, thank you.
What are you doing?
What's going on? Help me!
Please, somebody, help me!
Stop!
Police!
Police!
Don't move or I'll shoot you!
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Thank you.
No problem.
Come on! Bring it!
- There he is!
- Get him!
Let's go!
Party time!
Hey, Angelo....
- This is the guy that busted your nose?
- Yeah, it's him.
He don't look so tough.
Yo, shithead!
You're going to die.
Easy, Angelo.
Not yet.
Easy.
Let's have some fun.
Rock and roll!
Are you ready?
Batter up!
Right down the middle.
Let's see an instant replay.
What's the matter with you,
you stupid jerk?
Show time!
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
Enough. Are you crazy?
Don't you ever call--
Who do you think you are?
My broken nose, you stupid bitch.
I'll kill you!
What do you think you're doing?
You asshole.
Nancy!
You loser.
- What?
- Lisa.
- Watch it.
- Stacey, wait.
- Where you going?
- Man, you wrecked the party.
- Hey, guys....
- Come on, Angelo.
- Wait!
- I'm out of here.
Hey, wait for me!
Are you here?
Why don't you ever answer me?
Did you eat?
Let me fix you something.
If I waited for you to cook,
I would have starved to death.
Where did you get that?
Did you use our food money to buy it?
No, Keung gave it to me.
Who's Keung?
He's our neighbor's nephew.
I told you never to go out
with anybody.
Especially strangers.
Do you know how dangerous it is?
He's not a stranger.
He's a nice guy.
You always tell me to stay home.
How about you?
You always go out, every day.
I bet you don't remember the last time
you took me to the park.
I have to work.
Who else is going to support us?
Support, support.
I told you I need a new cushion...
...but you never buy me one.
You just ignore me.
See?
I'm sorry.
I'll get you one tomorrow.
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
Always tomorrow.
I said I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, really I am.
I'll get you one tomorrow...
...l promise.
What happened?
It's Keung.
What happened?
That's Keung?
Somebody help! Help!
Go get me a towel. Go!
Oh, Keung, you awake?
Are you okay?
I got beat up.
There must've been a lot of people.
My sister, she fixed up
your wounds and undressed...
...you too.
She even made you breakfast.
Here, have some.
How old is she?
She's twenty-one...
...and she's pretty.
Where is she?
She went to school...
...and after school she usually works.
Hope you get to meet her soon.
What are you doing now?
- Going to the market.
- Is that important?
I have to go.
- Why are you going?
- Elena needs my help.
Get him!
Get out of my car.
Hey, buddy,
are you all right?
There's no way out. Give up.
He's going up. Get him!
Get him.
He's going to the roof. Let's go!
Go around!
I can't find him.
Find him.
Come on, guys, keep looking.
Check those cars over there.
What the hell are you doing
in my truck?
Man, he's in here.
He's going over.
He's through. Keep pushing.
Where are you going?
Piece of shit!
You've got no place to run.
Let's make a deal.
You kiss my ass and we'll let you go.
Right there.
Come on, kiss my tattoo.
Let me shake it for you.
Son of a bitch.
I can't believe this guy.
The cops are coming.
Let's go.
Tony, it's the cops.
Let's get out of here.
Jordan, pull over here.
Wait for my signal
and keep your eyes open.
They're here.
Can we trust this guy?
These are the only guys
who can handle a score this big.
They better--
Don't worry. Stay cool.
It's about three point fifty carats.
F-color.
VVS-one.
Man, they're all good.
Where are the rest of the stones?
You think I'm crazy?
Where's the cash?
Okay, I want the diamonds...
...now.
The king and queen are here.
Shut up.
Where are the boys anyway?
- They've gone shopping.
- Great.
- What's up?
- You don't have to come up.
Okay.
Why don't you get rid of her?
She's a pain in the ass.
I won't hear any more shit
from you, Angelo.
Okay, whatever.
- Did I say something wrong?
- Let's go.
- What's going on?
- Take a look.
Get the gold.
Holy shit.
I'll take that.
What's going on?
Hold it.
Freeze, now!
Shoot them.
Take care of this mess.
Let's go.
It's him.
Who are these guys?
Why are they still shooting?
Don't shoot.
- Don't move.
- Please don't shoot.
I ain't got nothing.
Nothing.
Give me my stuff or
I'll blow your head off.
I got nothing, man.
I know you got it.
Where is it?
- I got nothing. Nothing.
- Where is it?
- I'm clean.
- Cops are all over the place.
Freeze!
What's going on?
What's happening?
Move. Keep your hands up.
Move it!
Move it down.
What happened?
The bad guys were here,
but the police caught them.
Boy, you're heavy.
So, this is your home?
- Bet your sister's not here.
- I think you're right.
Let me get your racing car.
Keung, come and...
- ...look at this.
- What's up?
Come here. Come here.
What is it?
Look!
My sister bought
a new cushion for me.
Nancy....
Nancy, are you home?
Is there anybody home?
Keung, could you please get...
- ...my wheelchair?
- Okay.
How come your sister
is never home? What does she do?
She's a flight attendant and a model.
She's very busy.
Last time, didn't you say
she was in school?
She just graduated.
She has all kinds of jobs.
Well, that just means she loves you.
Just be good to her.
When I go to the park and I see other
kids playing with their sisters...
...and I can't,
I really get mad at myself.
That's not your fault. You can't blame
yourself. You're a smart kid...
...looking after yourself.
I wish my legs
were like other kids'...
...so I could take care
of her myself.
And I wouldn't have
to worry about her.
Because I really love her.
Nancy, you're home.
Why are you crying? What's wrong?
This is my best friend, Keung.
And my sister, Nancy. Isn't she pretty?
- Well, not right now.
- I'm sorry.
Never mind. Forget the past.
You two know each other?
Your sister...
...bumped into me on the staircase.
Bet your cushion works well.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Come on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- What about the guns?
- Guns? What guns?
- I'm a tourist in this city.
- What about the explosions?
You been out there playing
with your toys?
Come on.
So we have a list of missing diamonds,
guns without fingerprints...
...an empty briefcase and an explosion
that destroyed most of the evidence.
These boys are professionals.
I'm sure they had something to do
with that heist last week.
- What?
- The lawyer's here.
Damn it, not now.
- I'm afraid we gotta let them go.
- Why?
The lawyer's too well-connected.
Go on, get out of here.
Connected?
Everyone in this damn town is connected.
Let Angelo go.
We'll sit back and watch what happens.
- You better say a prayer for him.
- Yeah.
Who are you?
- What are you doing here?
- I live here?
Have you seen anything
unusual today?
- Who are you?
- We're the FBl.
I heard some gunfire, explosions,
but I went home. I saw nothing at all.
We're trying to recover
some stolen property.
If you find anything,
give us a call.
Okay? There's a big reward.
- Okay.
- You've been very cooperative.
You're free to go.
I'll take the stairs.
Keep searching.
There.
Thank you.
Good to see you.
What went down this morning?
I don't know. I don't want
to talk about it.
- Angelo still in jail?
- I heard he got out, but disappeared.
Where's Nancy? Go find her.
- I'll get her.
- I think Angelo's hiding something.
Angelo?
That wouldn't surprise me.
Hey, baby!
- Here you go, hon'.
- Thanks.
- He's kind of cute.
- Jackie!
Thanks for coming.
Thank you. Nice place.
Aren't you afraid of the tiger?
We've been friends for a while.
Do you really like this job?
It's good money. What's wrong?
Nothing. You dance well.
Very good.
Thank you.
Hey, Nancy, what's up?
Tony....
- Let's go.
- Nancy's with the Chinese guy.
- What?
- Over there.
Shit. Get him.
Come on.
This way.
Over there.
Come on.
- Bitch.
- Look at the bikes.
He's going to pay for this big time.
Don't hang around with those guys.
Spend more time with Danny.
He needs you.
Don't let your situation change you.
You change it.
You're right.
I need some time to change.
Do you have a girlfriend?
You are cute.
Where is he, you stupid bitch?
If you don't tell me, they'll
keep tearing this place apart.
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.
- Can I help you?
- Ice cream, please.
Sure.
- Here's your ice cream.
- Thank you.
Ice cream.
Can I have some ice cream?
Sure.
Come get your ice cream.
Got sundaes, got chocolate,
vanilla, strawberry.
- What kind?
- I'll have chocolate.
We'll be right back, Danny.
Help, Keung!
Somebody stole my cushion.
Hey, you!
Shit!
He went that way.
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.
I don't know where Angelo is.
I don't know anything.
Maybe this will help.
- Sir, they don't want to talk.
- I want my diamonds back.
Okay, boys.
It's your turn.
What happened?
If you'd been here,
you would know...
...but you weren't...
...as you should have been...
...because you were out on a date...
...with the neighborhood
gang-leader's girlfriend.
And that's the problem.
They were looking for you,
so they came here for revenge.
I shouldn't blame you.
It's all my fault.
You don't live here.
You came for your uncle's wedding.
I wanted your help.
Perhaps I should thank you.
I just don't know why...
...l thought this would work...
...and why I thought
I could depend on you.
- Where's Tony?
- I think I know where he is.
How's it going?
Hey, Nancy....
- Who's that?
- No one. Just a friend of mine. Go.
- New squeeze?
- Yeah, sure.
You are all garbage.
This is where it ends...
- ...big shot.
- You got the guts?
Drop the gun.
Tony! Tony! Tony!
Hold it!
Stop!
I said that's enough.
Okay, you win.
Go.
What are you thinking?
You can spend the rest of your life
beating up people and robbing them.
Why lower yourself?
Don't you know
you're the scum of society?
What did he say?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Let me get your jacket.
Thank you.
- Did he really mean that?
- Yeah.
You know he's right.
Sometimes we go too far.
Help.
Help him.
What's going on?
What is that?
- They killed Lance.
- Who killed Lance?
Some guys in a limo.
It was terrible.
- What is that?
- Who would do this?
Keung, a friend of mine
got murdered.
They said if we don't return the stuff
Angelo took, we'll end up like Lance.
Where's Angelo now?
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
Where is Angelo?
- Where is he?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I think I know.
- Let's get him.
No, we better call the police.
I don't deal with cops.
They're not cops. They're FBl.
Thank you.
You talk to me,
and you talk to me now.
- Don't you know you'll die?
- FBl's here.
That ain't the FBl.
Get him.
Oh, no, you don't.
Where are the diamonds?
I don't know what the hell--
Stay down!
I asked you where the diamonds are.
In Danny's wheelchair.
What?
Okay.
Where are the diamonds?
- I don't know.
- One...
...more chance.
- Don't shoot. I know.
- Where?
Don't fuck with us.
- Gabriel.
- Let's go.
Hi, Keung. What's happening?
Hey, don't!
Come on. Move.
Let me go.
Shut up.
Put me down.
He's just a kid.
No, that's my new cushion.
Don't. Stop it.
Don't rip my new cushion.
Don't hurt him.
Where're the diamonds?
- Stop.
- I don't know.
You want the diamonds?
I'll tell you where some are.
Where are they?
- Where are they?
- In my sister's room.
Wait.
I think
the diamonds are there.
In the red box.
Don't try anything stupid.
You call these diamonds?
They're my sister's diamonds.
Keep your hands up.
Do you know where they are or not?
Don't move. Let go.
Danny, you okay?
I'm okay.
He's just a kid.
Keung, catch.
Okay.
Okay.
- Thank you, Danny.
- You're welcome.
Move.
You'll be sorry.
You're gonna die.
What's the difference between
these diamonds and my sister's?
I think...
...about seven million dollars.
- Did you get through?
- The police put me on hold.
Are you there?
What's happening?
Have you got my diamonds?
Yes.
Make sure you get rid of the Chinaman
and the kid. Leave no witnesses.
You want to kill me?
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm the Chinaman.
I have your people.
I have your diamonds.
What do you want?
I just want my friends back.
Did you call the cops?
Did you?
No.
You better not have...
...if you want your friends back.
Keep this phone and wait for my call.
I'll tell you what to do.
Hello?
Go to school and wait for me.
Take care of him. Thanks.
Take care of my sister.
Be careful.
You too.
Tell me where the Chinese guy is.
All I know is he's the owner
of the Wah Ha supermarket.
- Hi, Keung.
- Hi.
Hey, Keung....
Look. Didn't we do
a great job renovating?
We've been working 24 hours a day.
Pretty impressive, huh?
No reason to quit now.
I'll make it even better...
...than before.
- It's very nice.
- What's wrong?
Do you have someplace quiet?
What do you mean, "quiet"?
Look.
Glass doesn't sparkle like that.
Can't be.
Don't tell me these are real?
They're real, but stolen.
Okay, everybody, lunchtime.
Go upstairs.
Lisa, lock the door.
All right, let's go.
- You must help me.
- Why should l? Those fellows can die.
They did so much damage,
I'll take a few as payback.
Please don't do that.
I need them for ransom.
That's serious.
Well, call the police.
I did. That's why we're in trouble.
I don't know what to do.
No one will notice if I took a few.
Mr. Keung, where are you?
You don't need to know.
Where's my friends?
You'll find out.
Just come down to the supermarket.
Just come down.
Now what?
He said to go to the supermarket.
He must think you own the supermarket.
What can he do to you?
He's bluffing. Trying to scare you.
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.
You don't need diamonds
in the bathroom.
Hey, come on.
This is no joke.
Women.
Get in the cab.
Go on, move.
Come on.
Start it up.
Elena, open up.
Go away.
Open up first.
Leave me alone.
Elena, are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm ruined. I have nothing left.
I'm finished.
Don't do that. I can see you.
Of course you can.
So can everyone on the street.
So what?
What is the big deal?
- I'll pay you back.
- I'll kill you, you devil.
It's all your fault.
You've ruined me.
You wrecked my home!
What are you trying to do to me?
- Are you trying to kill me?
- I don't want to kill you. I'm jumping.
- Don't.
- I'm jumping.
Just relax. Relax.
It's the phone. The phone.
Mr. Keung....
Yes.
So how do you like my style?
Hey, quiet down.
No one bargains with me.
Where's my friends?
If I don't have the diamonds in 1 hour,
you'll never see your friends again.
Yes.
Give me the address.
One hundred Beach Avenue.
One hundred Beach--
Quiet. I have to figure out
how to save them.
Figure out how to save me.
I'll give you a big diamond.
You promise? No excuses.
I hope I call the real cops this time.
Maybe they're in here.
- What are you doing?
- Looking for diamonds.
Hello, hello....
Police?
We think these guys work for a syndicate
run by a man named White Tiger.
You gotta find a way
to get to him. So...
...l want you to just show them
this one diamond.
Get them to talk
about the murder and the robbery.
And try to get them to name
names and places.
If you don't,
we don't have any hard evidence.
I only care about my friends.
Don't worry.
We'll get them back. How is he?
- Good.
- Okay, testing, testing.
Here comes Ahab the Arab.
How is it?
- Good.
- Okay.
Try to say something.
Okay, let's go, kiddo.
Keung, listen.
Don't worry. They won't do anything
in a restaurant. Not in a public place.
Not really.
What about the last time they threw
a grenade into the crowd? Be careful.
Don't worry, we'll back you up.
What the hell is wrong with you?
ls that smoke affecting your brain?
What are you stupid?
Don't you understand anything?
- Keep the change.
- Don't worry, we got you covered.
Code 4,
got the Tiger by the tail.
There they are.
It's good.
Okay, where's the rest
of our diamonds?
The diamonds are part of the robbery.
When they sold them, people got killed.
How can you say they're yours?
Smart, very smart.
It's none of your business.
If you want to see your friends...
...give us the rest of our diamonds.
I want to see
my friends first.
No, I can't do that.
You guys can't make that decision.
I want to see White Tiger.
Don't mention White Tiger.
Our boss is not White Tiger.
If your boss is not White Tiger...
...l'm talking to the wrong people.
Stay.
Just hold on.
Hey, boss, you've got a call.
This is Jordan.
I think they're on to us.
- He called you White Tiger.
- He shouldn't know my name.
He knows it.
Maybe he went to the cops.
Search him to see if...
...he's wired, idiot.
Okay.
My boss'd like to see you.
He's got it.
Come with me.
Birds are flying.
Let's go.
Check.
Your boss stays in the boat house?
Which one is it?
He stays here? ln number--
What number?
He was wired.
He's working with the police.
Kill him, kill the hostages.
We don't want any evidence.
We didn't find the diamonds.
Forget the diamonds.
We don't want any trouble.
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of it.
- So, what'd the boss say?
- Kill him...
...kill the hostages...
...leave the diamonds.
I know where the diamonds are.
You want the diamonds, right?
Too late.
Come on!
There he goes.
Move.
Go on.
Jordan....
He's here. He's not going
anywhere. He's stuck.
Clear!
Go after them. You okay?
- What now?
- Kill the hostages, leave no evidence.
Quick!
They'll kill my friends.
They won't kill your friends.
Help's on the way.
On the way?
Quick. Get out of here. Let's go.
Shit! It's too late. Come on.
Howard, are you okay?
I don't know.
Where do you think you're going?
Move! Down here.
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way. Move.
Move. Come on.
Where's the captain?
Cover me.
Don't fire. Civilians.
Get in there. Go.
Let's go. Move!
They've got hostages.
Call for the Coast Guard. They're on...
...the hovercraft.
It's him. Give me that gun.
Damn!
Marine Unit Three,
roger your message.
In hot pursuit of hovercraft.
Yellow hovercraft,
200 meters dead ahead.
Got them.
Hovercraft, this is the police.
Stop at once.
- We have to stop.
- Go through or I'll blow you away.
- There's a police helicopter out there.
- Get rid of it.
Look out! Are they crazy?
This is the police.
Stop immediately
or we'll open fire.
Turn around.
Go the other way. Move!
Run him over.
No.
My baby!
Shit.
- Are you okay?
- No.
Hovercraft is now heading east
on 48th Street.
Harrison here.
We're in position.
We'll stop them.
Oh, God, my car.
Look what they've done.
Hovercraft!
Turn around. Go back.
I can't.
Move it, move it, move it.
Block this intersection now.
Let's go.
- Do something.
- What?
There's no way
it can be stopped.
Move your car!
That's my car!
- Where are the hostages?
- I don't know.
Where are they?
Wait. I'll tell you,
just don't shoot.
Hey, excuse me.
- Have you seen Mr. White?
- I saw him on hole 17.
- Thank you very much. Have a good day.
- Bye-bye.
Keung, hole 17. Copy.
I copy. We're getting him set up.
Go here and then over there.
Got that?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Can you really drive this thing?
- I think I can manage.
You're okay.
And you, they found you.
Thank you.
- He's at hole 17.
- Yes, thank you.
You guys want a ride?
- Sure.
- Let's go.
Unit Three, what's the official
reason for this ride?
White Tiger's hoods have control...
- ...of the thing.
- Unit Three, copy.
Look at that.
It's the Chinese guy.
Shoot him.
Get him.
Get him.
Get him.
Run him down.
Run him down.
