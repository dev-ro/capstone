When I was little,
my mum and I loved to sit
and look at the night sky.
We dreamed that we were not alone,
that the stars were
the eyes of the angels
who were watching over us.
But when Mum fell ill,
none of them helped.
And so I realized that
there's nothing out there,
except silence, emptiness and cold.
Let's go.
Quiet!
Charl, what are you looking at?
There's nothing there.
Come on, let's go!
For most of history, people
have feared meteor showers.
Only recently have we begun
to understand these visitors
who penetrates the earth's atmosphere.
Earlier on, these cosmic stones were
associated with the wrath of God.
How are things with you?
Why don't you tell me?
I'll get together with some Albert,
and won't tell a thing about it.
- There's nothing to tell.
- Nothing, really?
What's going on between you two?
Where do you... you know?
If I knew such a Romeo,
I'd run away from home.
Maybe.
But Tyoma thinks of Romeo only as
a make of car, if you see what I mean.
And today we are witnessing a
unique astronomical phenomenon.
Mironov...
Good Morning.
Did you sleep well?
- Why Mironov?
- Just because. Don't sleep!
Who can tell me
where and when occurred
the last meteor shower,
that had a magnitude comparable to
what's expected today.
In China.
'76.
Yulia. Are you having a
scientific debate?
- A scientific debate, exactly.
- And?
Google says in China, in 1976.
Google is right.
The most terrible events in
human history
have happened when men
faced something...
Unknown...
Frightening.
The bloodiest crusades were
triggered by meteor showers.
And then what happened, Mironov?!
I'm not sleeping, I'm listening.
Google.
All the crusaders, about 300,000
people, died in the desert.
Yes. Yes.
The brain!
And this despite the fact that
these meteor showers, in scale,
don't compare with today's.
And us here... won't we also...?
Are you crazy?
I hope not.
The debris will burn up in the upper
atmosphere, don't be afraid.
Tonight, watch the shooting stars!
Did you hear?
- Yes!
- Take care!
By the way...
- What's this?
- Two concert tickets for Korzh.
I thought you and I could go.
But compared to your
Alfa Romeo's vroom vroom,
I'm not really in the race.
- Thank you!
- Bye!
- Bye!
All the best!
The shooting stars tonight!
- Yes! - Bye!
- Bye!
- Give me your notebook, I'll correct it.
- Were you a good student?
I'll call you.
Hi.
Well then...
Dad?
Hi! It's me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm home just for a few seconds.
Do you know where
the binoculars are?
I'll be home late tonight.
Don't leave the apartment.
But we're all meeting at
the parking lot.
- It's the best spot to see the meteors.
- No.
Definitely no?
Is there any weighty arguments?
Convincing reasons?
Crowds of people on a
roof with a low wall,
most of them drunk.
I think the argument is convincing.
Dad, I won't be alone.
Tyoma is waiting for me.
- Artyom?
- Yes.
Then, certainly, no!
Great!
I don't mean to pressure you, but
a meteor shower like that won't
occur again for maybe 50 years.
I'm not coming.
- Did Comrade Colonel forbid you to go out?
- He never leaves me alone!
I wish they'd sent him somewhere.
On a business trip.
To Jupiter!
He just left. I saw him.
So, I see no problem.
I'm ready to rescue my
princess from the tower.
Unidentified flying object detected.
Bearing 340, distance 280.
The flying object doesn't answer.
The object came from the west.
It's now just north of Finland.
- What kind of object?
- It was just detected.
Very large, moves in our direction.
- Roger that.
- Speed?
- Speed is erratic.
- Erratic? Are they in trouble?
Not yet ascertained.
It moves at between 500 and 900 km/h.
- Strategic partners were consulted?
- Yes! They don't know.
Lithuania and Latvia
are also on standby.
But if this thing doesn't slow down,
they won't even have time to take off.
Bearing 190.
The object has passed the coast.
It's big. Keeping visual contact.
Deploy interceptors.
Activate missile defence.
Notify the Ministry and let them
announce the state of emergency.
Ready!
477 is in the air!
477 to Atlanta, I'm on my way.
477 and 478 are on course.
Despite the high-rise buildings,
we have a good view of the sky.
And there's much to see today!
The north-east of the capital is cloudy,
so many came here, south of Moscow,
to watch this celestial show.
Don't listen to this drivel!
Fuck off!
As you can see, some are already beginning
to celebrate this rare natural event...
Crap! Let's do it again!
Leave it!
I'm just going to adjust his mirrors.
Hey, what's that bullshit?!
There are pedestrians around here!
What the hell?!
Do you need help, Tyoma?
All right, guys.
There's no need!
Hi!
- Guess what I got.
- What's this?
A ticket for the VIP box!
477. 10 on the left.
Roger that. Have visual contact.
This is crazy!
Repeat, 477.
It's huge!
- Yulia.
- Yes?
I think we're in the way.
- We?
- We!
Don't you see she wants to be alone?
- Uh, no.
- Yes.
She's my girlfriend and
I'm not leaving her alone.
Take it! You're so annoying!
Go. No one's there. I live alone.
Oh what a beauty!
"Oh what a beauty!"
You have no idea what's beautiful!
You'll miss this.
We're in a Moscow inner courtyard,
and right behind me, you
can see the meteor shower.
Show me another one.
Yes.
Be quiet!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Base to 477. The aim is to disable it.
477 to base. I hear you.
477, fire then bank to the left.
- And if it's not NATO?
- How could it not? See any force field?
477, was the target hit?
Yup! It's losing speed.
477 to base. I'm losing control!
477, self-eject!
Sveta stayed there alone.
I can't do this.
She's your friend, she can wait.
Can I at least call her briefly?
Please, Tyoma!
Yulia! Hold tight!
Hold tight!
Intelligence is almost there.
They should report in a few minutes.
The Tech unit is also on its way.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes I'm listening.
- Protective clothing, Colonel.
- I don't need it.
Be careful.
You understand,
who knows what this thing is?
And here's another great news.
A deputy from the parliamentary
group is going with you.
- What's that about?
- It's necessary.
He wants to see the impact zone.
Is this really XL?
Yes, it's wide enough.
The world's attention is riveted
on the events unfolding in Moscow.
We managed to get through to
Mikhail Poleskin, State Duma deputy,
who plans to personally inspect
the scene of the crash.
Mikhail Petrovich, where are
you and what has happened?
At the moment, I am still
on the way to the crash site.
There is no reason to claim that
we're dealing here with an
object of extraterrestrial origin.
But if this assumption
were confirmed,
this event would certainly
go down in history.
17 teams are already on the ground
and 4 are close to Chertanovo.
- One is on the road with dogs.
- Mobilize all reservists!
Take the girl!
Yulia!
Yulia, look at me!
Yulia!
Stop!
- Are you tired of life?!
- Open the door, quickly!
Yulia!
Do you hear me? Stay with me!
- Come on, come on!
- Carefully!
Of course, it's not safe. You never
know what's inside this thing.
There could be a nuclear reactor
and a second Chernobyl awaiting us.
Why did they chose you for contact?
Was this a committee decision?
No, I volunteered and the
Ministry of Defence agreed.
Hello? Can you hear me?
Did you activate the jammers already?
- Can you stop where there's reception?
- No.
But it's a live broadcast!
Mikhail Petrovich, can you hear us?
Unfortunately, we lost the connection.
Let me remind you that, about an hour ago,
a catastrophic incident occurred
in Chertanovo.
An unidentified object crashed
in a residential tower complex.
The number of victims is yet
to be determined.
The Atlantic Alliance is currently
negotiating with Moscow
for access to the site.
Experts are reluctant to confirm
the reports of eye-witnesses
to the effect that we're dealing
with an alien invasion.
And yet, from different parts of the world
come reports of armed forces
on high state of alert.
Meanwhile, the streets adjacent to
the crash site are cordoned off.
The Defence Ministry is so far
abstaining from comment.
But local residents tell of tactical units
surrounding a strange sphere.
Combat helicopters are also
hovering over the crashed object.
- What about radioactivity?
- In the normal range.
There is no danger for people. Over.
We'll keep monitoring. Over.
I'm in position. Everything's quiet.
- Any visible activity?
- Nothing to see.
We have contact.
I see it.
The object is in my sight.
Well, it's time for
a welcome speech.
I greet you.
I'm Michael Poleskin,
Member of Parliament.
This is the representative
of the Ministry of Defence,
responsible for the sector, so to speak...
Lebedev.
You are called Lebedev?
- Lebedev.
We are ready for fruitful cooperation.
The first step to which
has already been laid
in the course of our contribution
to your successful landing.
So...
Welcome to our Earth!
Don't.
No abrupt movements.
We got that.
Ready to open fire.
- Negative!
- Roger that.
Report every detail. Subjectively.
What you saw, felt, thought.
They asked us not to come nearer.
They said we could avoid casualties,
if we let them repair their
ship and leave our planet.
What do you mean by "said"?
With words?
- I'm not sure, but I understood.
- In what language did you speak?
In Russian.
What did they mean by "avoid casualties"?
Was that a threat?
I don't think so.
I didn't sense aggression.
Has anyone else heard
this conversation?
- A deputy was with you.
- Yes. He's in intensive care.
His pacemaker failed. Like all electronic
devices near the ship.
I'm sorry, but what's stopping us
from carrying out an assault right now?
I agree. We shot them down somehow,
so liquidation shouldn't be a problem...
If we hadn't shot them down,
there wouldn't have been any victims.
What do you suggest?
Wait. Keep observing them.
Nothing more.
The main thing now is
not to provoke aggression.
Let's wait.
For 3 days, the world's attention
have been riveted on
the events in Moscow.
The object is being examined by an
international group of experts.
The UN Security Council has raised
concerns about the Moscow incident.
A US government representative has demanded
immediate access to the crash site.
The UN resolution however
was blocked by the Russian side.
Woke up?
- Yulia?
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?
- My head hurts.
Yeah... So, Yulia.
Look here.
Good.
You shouldn't have taken
off the bandage.
Lie down. I'll call your father.
... Commander Lebedev is responsible for
the coordination of the armed forces.
Within a radius of 1 km, protective
structures have been erected.
The nearby streets are
closed to traffic,
the residents have been evacuated
although many have refused
to leave, fearing looting.
The death tolls now stands at 232.
Dozens are listed as missing.
Sveta...
Tyoma.
Did the doctor allow you to get up?
She can wait.
My little one, what is it?
I'm with you! I'll always
be there, do you hear?
Hop in!
Thanks, Tyoma!
Andrei, I'm driving!
The doctor said she's OK, but
if her head starts spinning or hurting,
- to come back at once.
- Thank you for taking her here.
But without you...
she wouldn't have been there.
You're welcome.
... has rejected the proposal on the
participation of international experts
in the study of the
crashed object in Moscow.
The Russian president has
emphasized that our own experts
have the skills and
technical equipment required
to monitor the situation.
The government spokesman has
stressed that today's talk
occurred at the request of
the American side.
In further news, more than
200 deaths have been reported.
The news said 200 people died.
Is it true or a lie?
True.
Are we at war?
Depends on how they behave.
Who are they?
Good question.
THIS IS OUR EARTH!
Dad?
What will happen to us now?
The city is under curfew. No
one is allowed out after 9pm.
You come home immediately
after school. Is that clear?
Yes sir!
You know, Yulia, I've got
enough to do at the moment.
I cannot watch you all the time.
Can you, for once in your
life, help me? Just help me?!
You're welcome.
Well finally!
- Good day.
- Hi.
Hi grandma!
How many times have I asked you?
Just say Ljuba.
I don't like that word.
How are you, sweety?
He got you here, did he not,
so I wouldn't run away?
Not at all. Your father wanted
to send you to Krasnodar.
- Say thanks, I was against it.
- That's typical of him.
His panacea in every thorny
situation: Out of sight, out of mind!
But it's not settled yet.
You might still go.
Send me wherever
you want, I don't care.
Yulia, what's your WiFi password?
I want to post a photo I took of
the UFO, while it's still of interest.
Should be nine, nine times,
but officially, I don't know.
At the barracks, the commander only
gives the WiFi password for good behaviour.
Excuse me, I have to go.
Then go. Go fight your aliens.
- You're better at that.
- Thank you for coming.
SCHOOL 1191
Hi Yulia! Transport is free.
- If you please!
- So, that's how it's going to be?
Cool! Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Fine.
Guys. I perfectly understand
how hard it is for you.
We all have lost loved ones, friends.
But despite the bitterness of loss,
one cannot give in to anger.
You cannot. People.
For thousands of years, we've waited for a
encounter with an extraterrestrial civilisation.
That's ended now!
We have no idea what moral
standards the newcomers have,
what they think about life, death.
Do they understand the pain of loss?
If they don't, why should
we explain it to them?
Why should we establish contact?
Why can't we just get rid of them?
Because this is a unique
chance for all mankind.
A chance to die?! To give
your house to some freaks?
A chance to learn
something about ourselves.
To find out who we are.
Maybe even... to find a home.
I know all about myself. I'm home!
- And I didn't invite them in!
- Yulia...
If not for them, everything would be
fine. And Sveta would be alive!
Yulia...
In the service of the Motherland
Lebedev V. Yu.
Guys, check out this video
posted on VKontakte.
Come here, Python!
Go back to the start.
Wait, there's more.
Nits!
Acting as if they were at home!
Almost a billion clicks.
- The whole world is watching.
Let's see how many will be left
when these blood suckers spread.
You think they'll break out of the cordon?
What do you think they're here for?
To hang around the fence?
Hey, we could repost the videos.
With negative comments.
We could start a trend on the Net.
Very brave, guys! Well done!
Yulia?
All you can do is post, re-tweet and like.
- Listen, friend. Watch your tongue,
- Sit down!
Sit down? Tell this bimbo to sit down.
She's not a bimbo, she's my girl.
Oh yes?
She looks like a bimbo to me.
Calm down!
- Come here!
- Stop it!
That's enough!
Break it off!
She's my girl, is that clear?!
And I love her, you understand?
Or do I have to say it again, huh?
And I love you! Is that clear?
Idiot!
- What are you going to do?
- What do you suggest?
Go there to prove who's
in charge in the district?
- Yes!
- Opa, opa, opa!
America, Europa!
And what about the cordon?
I mean, if the soldiers weren't
there, I would go myself.
We can't just sit around and
wait. After what they did.
We shouldn't, Tyoma.
Of course.
And we won't.
There's a way in I'm sure
the soldiers don't know.
A fortified fence has been
erected in this district.
Unauthorized access to
the enclosed area...
Curfew in half an hour.
Let's go, boys!
Hold this.
The old processing plant.
It's been closed for 20 years.
My father used to work here.
Finally, some good out of it.
The plan: We go inside quietly
and carefully.
If we meet our people,
we take them with us.
If we find the aliens, we observe
them, but from a distance.
We have to understand what they
want, and then tell everyone.
Just don't play the hero.
Rus, especially you.
- You owe me another five.
- You'll get it back!
Patrol.
Keep going. And you, stay here.
It's dangerous ahead.
- I said I'm coming.
- Sit down! Sit down!
If need be, shoot, and we'll come running.
Seems to be empty.
- Tyoma!
- Why are you yelling?!
Tyoma, come here.
Is that a bomb?
Probably fell through the ceiling.
Yul, damn it!
I understand, love and so on.
But what's going on here is beautiful.
Just unbelievable.
Come back quickly!
- Yulia!
- Up there!
Higher! I know where!
- Where are you going?
- I think it was here!
Left!
Yulia!
Go downstairs!
There he is!
- Zhenya!
- Quiet! Don't yell!
Yulia!
So, let's go down!
What's this?
A kind of armour.
Like ours.
Where's the creature?
Rus...
We're taking it.
Quiet!
- Patrol! Let's get away!
- What about this?
- Leave it! Help us!
- It's heavy.
Drop it, run!
Help us!
Come on, come on!
Faster!
An object has been discovered,
probably of extraterrestrial origin.
Don't touch anything!
Switch on the light!
One two...
Hook it!
Fly, my dear.
Well... What now?
Should we give it to the military?
We'll sort it out tomorrow.
Now, off to bed.
Hey!
Hi!
Okay, Google.
- You want to study medicine, don't you?
- Yes.
Can you skip the class?
I really need you.
Wow!
This is just incredible!
Humanoid type, as I always said.
They found water in our system, and
there's a trillion planets in the galaxy.
The probability of life was 99.9.
Everyone has been excited about
their alien suits, but the...
Can you calm down?
Think about what we can do.
We need a doctor.
Seriously?
And I wouldn't have thought
of it myself? No doctor!
- The military would capture him! Get it?
- Well, so what?
He saved my life, I owe him.
Hold this.
There seems to be
no visible fractures.
He needs blood.
- He's lost a lot.
- Ours?
Well, yes. He's breathing our air
and his anatomy is similar to ours.
His blood might also be similar to ours.
The truth is, there's a
chance it could kill him.
But without a transfusion,
he'll definitely die.
You're calling an ambulance, right?
A friend of Dad is a doctor.
He treated me after they crashed.
Igor Semyonovich?
Hi, this is Yulia.
You said to call you if
the headache came back.
Yes, can I come right now?
And please ask for a transit
permit for the car.
Thank you.
You take a picture of him,
I'll kill you, understand?
Hey, wait! Where are you going?
Haematology. Igor Semyonovich's orders.
This is urgent. A VIP. No registration.
This way!
Attention!
Here it is!
Stop!
And if we're discovered?
Then I'll say, it was your plan and
you forcibly dragged me here.
Will you stay for me? I'll kiss you.
Wait... Isn't it how you
get someone to betray their country?
Absolutely! Come on now!
- On three.
- What?
Three!
- Close the door, turn the light off!
- Yes!
- Finger!
- Which one?
The middle.
One, two, three.
Well, theoretically, it should work.
There you are!
His blood group is A positive.
Well, according to our classification.
But considering it's from the humanoid...
Enough! I'm A+ too!
Lie down. No, sit down, sit down.
So...
So, insert the needle parallel to the vein,
then find the vein, at the
angle of 45 degrees...
- Come on!
- Just a second.
OK. One, two, three!
No, stop!
Are you kidding me?
Oh, come on!
Yulia.
You go. You need to sleep.
Don't worry. I'll stay with him.
Everything will be fine.
But no photos or posts like "I'm
treating an alien". You hear?
- I'll be silent like a tomb!
- A tomb without WiFi and 4G.
No heat emission, no radioactivity,
no thermal reading.
Absolute symmetry.
Some kind of spherical
mount in a vacuum.
A weapon?
- I don't know yet.
- Well then.
Judging by the movement of
water masses and air fronts,
the ship draws water like a magnet.
Enough water for us to decide
to take emergency measures?
In our opinion, they need the water
for the regeneration of the ship.
About 30% of the external
damage caused by the crash
has been repaired.
We've obtained a piece of their technology,
and it shows the same properties,
but its function remains unknown.
- A weapon?
- Or an element of the ship.
People are already gathering
at the checkpoint.
Rumours are spreading on the Net
that we're hiding the scale of water loss.
As if the boat hadn't
already started to rock.
Well, take a decision! Connect
the town hall to the television
- and let them report every hour.
- We've already taken steps.
Water trucks at the checkpoint.
Water distribution inside the perimeter.
And what do you think we should
do about this element of the ship?
- I suggest we return it.
- To whom? Them?!
We don't know their intentions.
Our main task is to minimize the
possibility of open conflict.
Lebedev!
You were recommended as a
good commander for the rearguard,
not as an expert on
extraterrestrial cultures.
- Allow me to go?
- Where?
- To the rear.
- Please, don't take offence, Colonel!
We're not here on a first date!
Well then.
Your suggestion is good, but
we won't give anything back.
They may know all about us, but we
don't know anything about them.
And your element...
is the only thing we have.
What are you sitting here for?
- He's there, well...
- What?
He came to.
Crap, how can we communicate with him?
In theory there exists a
universal sign language.
Fuck!
Don't be afraid.
How cool is that?
This is speech reconstruction!
A few phrases, and he picked up
the structure of the language!
As I thought, a superior race!
I'm Hakon.
Please to meet you.
Not pleased.
This is a complementary expression,
used as a rule on first acquaintance.
I'm Google by the way,
if you're interested.
Is it yours?
- Yes.
- Take it off!
- Too late, conjugation's already done.
- The transfer of genetic material.
- It means you're stuck with it!
- I understood!
- Why are you here? What do you want?
- I think they want to civilize us.
They're bringing new
technologies to help humanity.
Am I right?
No? Then...
All you want is to extinguish
all life, or what?
This is a difficult question.
Don't move!
I need to go back. Find Shilk.
Get dressed!
You think he's already
learned the word for thanks?
Thank you is a form of gratitude.
She is grateful to you... for saving her.
You think you saved the
enemy and you're in trouble.
Will saying thank you
make it OK for you?
Are you ready?
- Then bugger off now!
- What does that mean?
Fuck off! Clear off!
Get the hell out of this garage
and off this planet, understood?
Go!
Why are you looking at me?
He's the superior race.
He'll find his people.
Theoretically, yes. But imagining...
You've already got to be clever.
Excuse me!
I'm talking to you!
Please stop!
Where are you going?
I'm just going.
First, your papers, then you
can go wherever you want.
What's going on with this buffoon?
Let's pick him up.
Arms!
The other one!
Here you go.
I'll pick it up later.
Hide it!
Stop!
Stop!
Crap!
This doesn't make sense.
You can't cut it.
Fuck me!
Think about how much dough
you'd get for this thing
in an online auction.
Guys, check this out.
It doesn't weight anything
when you wear it.
I'm an Avatar, get it?
It's a kind of exoskeleton.
And it's the right size for a person.
Guys!
Take this shit off me!
Pull out your hand!
Stretch your arm!
Pull!
Call an ambulance!
Are they just cuts?
What are you yelling?
Fuck your aliens! Why are
you still wanting to resist.
They're a hundred times stronger than you!
You'll soon see, all of you.
- Fuck off!
- What you talking about?
- Take your things and scram!
- Don't touch me!
- Come on, go home!
- Leave me alone!
- It's enough, Rus!
- What's enough?
- Chill out!
- Think you're so smart?
You'll be the first. The first
to die! Do you understand?
- Go home!
- Chill out!
What the fuck are we going
to do with it?
We'll give it up.
To whom?
- I'll call on Yulia's father to decide.
- Seriously?!
- What do you suggest?
- Sell it?
- Why not?
- I'll call him.
Hello, Valentin Yuryevich?
This is Artyom.
No, she's not with me.
- I have to show you something.
- Don't be like that with him.
- Could you come by?
- Why not?
Then I'll come to you. It's
quite urgent. I'm serious.
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.
Citizens, water is limited
to 5 litres per person.
Why so little?
I have children at home!
Free hotel rooms with all amenities
are available for those who wish.
Go get one yourself!
People are angry.
At least they're distributing water.
I repeat!
Free hotel rooms with all amenities
are available for those who wish.
Greetings, comrade Major.
Is Colonel Lebedev here?
- Valentin Yuryevich?
- Hasn't arrived yet.
What's going on here? Did you
retrieve something out there?
- Move the car away!
- Why?
- This is a safety zone. Move the car!
- We'll leave right away, quietly.
- Move the car away now!
- I'm not going anywhere.
Why so rough? This is our neighbourhood!
- Leave it! Stop it!
- I didn't touch him.
We'll leave right away.
Don't hit him!
What are you doing?!
Tosha! Anton! Get up, buddy!
Come on, help me!
Take him away!
Disperse!
Citizens! Disperse!
- Tyom, get in the car!
- I said, take him away!
Disperse immediately!
Citizens, vacate these grounds!
See you in the garage!
In small groups. Don't panic.
Move in the direction of the subway!
If you do not comply with
this order, force will be applied.
Move in the direction of the subway!
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?
Don't touch them!
Where are you going,
old man? Go home!
Stop!
We're all the same people!
It's enough! He has orders!
You want to be arrested?
Are you still alive?
Come on, get up.
Corridor formation!
- Don't struggle, it'll just be more painful.
- Close the ranks!
Hurry!
Greetings, Valentin Yuryevich!
Wait a moment.
Well, what did you want to say?
Wait!
I was just missing you.
We're not strangers.
We could sit down like a family,
talk, have a cup of tea, huh?
I don't understand. Is it too
early for you to talk or too late?
Too late!
Yulia was right, you don't
understand shit!
You're the king of Moscow,
aren't you? You've got everything.
Soldiers, cars, planes circling
around. You built a pretty fence.
You even have horses!
Stay away from Yulia!
Take him away.
Stand up straight.
Give me your hand.
- Junkie. Picked up on the street.
- God, the circus with horses!
... a fragment, presumably from the
so-called flying saucer, was retrieved.
Where do you think you're
going? Don't move.
This mysterious object is now
with the Ministry of Defence,
where its experts
continue to investigate...
Did you cut the tips off?
Vasya, this asshole doesn't have
fingertips. What should I do with him?
Register him as unknown.
Let the military take care of him.
Good day, comrade Colonel.
A friend of mine is detained here.
That tall, funny hat, old coat.
Have you seen him?
I am Lebedeva, Yulia.
Valentin Yuryevich's daughter.
- Do I need to know that?
- Actually, yes.
In case of declaration of martial law, the
military assumes governmental authority.
The commander in charge of the perimeter,
Valentin Lebedev, refrained from commenting.
All right.
Yulia Valentinovna.
Yes, your friend is quite
peculiar, Yulia Valentinovna.
It's just that he's from St. Petersburg.
Yulia?
- Yul!
- Let's go!
Yul!
- Yul!
- Wait for me!
- Yul!
- Stop!
- What happened to your face?
- It's alright, Princess!
When it's healed, I'll be
even more beautiful!
I'll call my father, he'll
get you out of here!
He sent me here.
I don't need help from him!
Can you hear me?
It's very important.
- I have to talk to you!
- Just go. We'll figure it out.
I just want to talk!
Let me through!
Tell your commander,
everything's about to change!
The whole area will soon be ours!
That'll be crazy!
You have to react when they talk to you!
Then there are fewer questions.
If you don't know what
to say, at least smile!
It would really help.
Something like that.
Come, I'll take you
to the perimeter.
Shilk is no longer there. Armed
men took it away. I saw it.
And without that Shilk, you
can't get on the ship?
Home is 47 light years away.
A transition is necessary
to contract time.
And without Shilk, Saul cannot
withstand the transition.
So you get your Shilk, and
leave immediately, right?
Do you want to help?
I can help.
There's a difference.
Take that off!
You'll melt! Come along.
I don't know if our
camera can show this,
but to the naked eye,
a change of colour is apparent.
Half an hour ago, we noticed that
the object was acquiring a reddish tint.
So far, we've not received any comment
from the unified information centre,
however, I doubt that anyone could say
anything definitive about the phenomenon.
Hey, guys, come over here!
- Why are you here?
- I am Yulia Lebedeva, the daughter.
Please tell my father
I need to talk to him.
He doesn't answer his phone.
Lebedev's daughter...
First we need a pass. Without
one, we won't get anywhere.
Then we'll find out
where exactly it is.
He's in a meeting. He'll call
you as soon as he's free.
Please, tell him that I'm pregnant.
In which month?
The third.
Comrade officers, please
vacate the premises.
Everyone leaves the room!
- Who is this?
- One of the possible candidates.
- What does that mean?
- Paternity is still unclear.
We have to have DNA
testing, don't we, Hakon?
Still unclear.
Still unclear. That's quite clear.
Did you serve in the army, Hakon?
I didn't serve.
So from tomorrow, you'll be at
the border guarding the homeland.
In a submarine.
And your Che Guevara will be
sent to the reformatory.
Great! The baby will be an orphan.
- I'll raise him.
- And if that doesn't work out?
Dad.
Hey Dad!
Please, don't be angry. I beg you.
It upsets me. And in my condition,
I shouldn't get upset, you know.
I don't understand what's going on.
You're angry.
There's no need.
Get out of here!
I'm getting out.
Come on, Hakon, go!
Is he wearing my clothes?!
You worry about that?
You're not strangers anymore.
So, why didn't you tell me sooner?
You really believed that, didn't you?
So you think it's funny, right?
Is this supposed to be a joke?
Do you think I have time
to listen to this moron?
When's the last time you
listened to me so closely?
Took interest in what's
going on in my life? Tell me.
Valentin Yuryevich!
A flying saucer crashed in our
city, you must have noticed!
But you don't care. You have
your dad here to fix everything!
And when the aliens have left,
what new excuse will you think of?
How?
That wasn't Lebedev!
That wasn't Lebedev!
Raise the alarm!
Warning! All personnel must take...
Why am I surprised? You
never gave a damn about me.
Even when Mum was dying, you
didn't let me say goodbye.
You said she was getting better.
I just didn't want it to
happen... before your eyes.
But you didn't even think of
asking me what I wanted?
Maybe I wanted to spend the last
months of her life beside her,
beside the only person
who understood me,
and not at the summer camp disco.
I'll never forgive you!
First unit, block this road!
Don't retract the posts!
- Deploy the spike strip!
- Yes, sir!
Second unit, block the
main entrance! Quickly!
No one must leave!
- Andrei!
- Yes?
- Yulia, home!
- Yes!
- And this one here, to Kamchatka!
- Yes, Colonel!
Get in!
- Serving the galaxy!
- That too.
Retract the posts! Let the car out!
- Did Yulia call?
- No.
Hi there!
- How are you?
- OK
- And you, superman?
- Everything's fine.
- So, how do we get rid of the armour?
- Forget it, we keep it.
Then what do we do, Tyoma?
Defend the homeland!
That's right!
- We should have added aluminium shavings.
- Nah, it's enough as it is.
Petrol and oil. Classic!
Che Guevara did it like that.
Hello, Tyoma, how are you?
Did they let you go?
Of course! General amnesty!
Listen, Yulia. I'm sorry for before...
At the police station, I wasn't myself.
You wanted to talk to me.
- Yes, but I can't right now...
- Want me to pick you up?
We've started a movement, here.
- You'll like it.
- Tyoma, I can't right now.
Ah, I understand. Dad.
It's OK
Well, if you want to see me, come over.
Yulia...
I love you.
Bye, Tyoma.
I need the Shilk to get back on
the ship as soon as possible.
Slow down! We're not going
in the restricted area now.
Tell the guard the name of your father.
Are you serious?
Just a week in Moscow and your
plans already involve corruption?
Until night comes,
we don't stand a chance!
What do we do until then?
You're as thin as a bean!
Do you need something to eat?
Or do you feed like...
with photosynthesis?
Come along.
Here we are, anyway.
Charl! Hello!
This is Charl.
This creature is suffering, it's in pain.
Yes, I know. She's very old.
Dad says she should
be put to sleep.
Put to sleep?
Killed.
But I can't.
Charl's a family member.
We bought her with my
mum. She's dead now.
You like to think about your mum
so you let the creature suffer?
No, on the contrary.
Well, I need her.
What for?
You don't have feelings, do you?
- We see and feel just like you.
- I don't mean that.
Gratitude.
Loneliness.
Hatred.
Love.
Love and hate are needed
to overcome the fear of death.
When there's no death, you
don't need love or hate.
This is crazy. I'll put that
on my status, OK?
Yulechka, don't you want to
introduce me to this young man?
Of course. Hak... Khariton,
this is Lyuba!
Lyuba, this is Khariton.
What an ancient name.
Old enough to be put to sleep?
- I'm sorry, what?
- Come along.
Lyuba, he's from St.
Petersburg, you know?
And once it was the cultural capital!
Yes.
What did you do with her?
This is Shilk!
When it's near, you can live forever.
Charl! Charl! Come here.
Healthy eyes!
Healthy dog?
Wait,
are you... immortal?
Mikhail Igorevich, please tell
us about the first contact.
A tragedy.
A tragedy on a global scale.
We were hoping to meet
reasonable, intelligent beings,
with whom we could conduct a
dialogue and exchange technologies.
But we're facing ugly creatures
that attacked us at the
first opportunity.
- Don't be tempted.
- What's this?
A dangerous thing.
30 minutes of watching will
make an alien like you melt.
It's delicious, thanks!
You're welcome.
MUSTARD
What for?
A joke.
But that isn't funny.
Eat, eat.
What made you jump?
Have you already met Dad?
- Yes.
- How was it?
He scared.
For his daughter, his home.
And I understand him well.
Don't worry, Lyuba, I'm
not going to marry him.
So your blessings would be wasted.
Well, too bad.
Here comes Dad with his military convoy.
Yulia!
- Where is she?
- In her room.
She's with a boy in there,
and I don't think that...
Out of the way!
It was so much better without you!
Why are you doing this?
What?
Inhale. It hurts.
And you give a fuck?
We have a tradition. Every time
some superior race comes along
to destroy humanity,
we all start to smoke,
so we can croak faster.
We don't want to destroy you,
you're hurting yourselves.
I urgently need an
interpreter from space.
- Do you like it here?
- No, I don't like it.
- And where do you like it?
- There, where the hill is.
But I can't go there now.
- Why, do you think?
- There's this thing.
- Is it hard? I'll help you.
- Of course!
You can't carry five litres.
That's why I take less.
But the soup is hardly
cooked, I must go again.
How, not too hard?
Of course, it's hard.
That's so cool! Before,
no one was interested.
Now, everyone's talking about us.
There are reporters everywhere!
Throw the ball! Thanks.
- Do you want it to be the same forever?
- Well, it won't always be. Probably...
Because it's martial law. And this
isn't a request! You have to comply!
Why are you standing here with
a rifle? Who are you guarding?
- Difficult to answer?
- Should I take your phone away?
We take pity on those who guard them.
Give them money so they can be
comfortable here in the district!
Hi.
Don't worry, we won't stay long.
We need to change clothes.
Don't worry.
They will kill you all, one by one.
Mark my words! You all!
I'm not a politician.
So I'll keep it simple.
I don't like what's going on.
No one likes it.
But we're not doing anything.
And what options do we have?
We can run away or bear it all.
Or we can stand up and say,
This is our Earth!
This is our Earth!
That's all I have to say.
THIS IS OUR EARTH!
Listen, this is not all like that. No.
- Where are your clothes?
- They're in there, in the closet.
Take it off!
Turn around.
Me too? Turn around?
- Away from me?
- Yeah.
Try it.
This is actually Dad's. Listen,
he'll be here in half an hour.
Maybe you can hang
around in the subway?
It's really crowded.
I mean, it would be safer.
- Don't think I'm kicking you out.
- I have a better idea!
Why does it hurt so much?
How do you like it?
Unusual, interesting, electric pulsation.
Clearly!
No one will look for us here.
A concert during martial law.
How unlikely is that?
- Let's rip it up?
- We'll rip ourselves apart?
What are you standing
there for? Undress!
Hi, Tyoma!
Listen, last time,
I was confused.
You understand.
No wait! I have some info!
You're doing fine!
Almost like a human!
I am human. We're different
branches of the same tree!
- I can't hear you!
- Give me your hand, you will.
My hand?
Shut up! Guess who I just saw!
Where are we?
This is my home.
It's almost like yours, only here
death hasn't occurred for a long time.
Do you often take girls home
on the very first date?
You are the first.
We're not allowed to make contact.
Crashing at Chertanovo was not contact?
We didn't want you to notice us.
The ship hit a meteor shower,
and the cloaking device failed.
- And then we knocked you down.
- Yes.
If someone tries to get on
the ship, Saul will destroy it.
We can't allow our technology
to fall into your hands.
And you're all ready to die for this?
It's...
It's the protocol.
So we return with your shilk.
Then what?
Then we fly away.
Forever?
People!
It's the curfew. We need to end.
But I want you to know. Many
of you have lost loved ones.
Many of you crave revenge.
It's here.
Stay united!
It's important, especially today!
Well, that's it?
This is harmful. Remember?
I just wanted to understand.
This, for instance.
When do you smoke?
When we're dying.
Am I not very old?
Right then.
Go.
- Yes?
- How are you? Can we meet?
Well, I can't.
It's not true. I don't want to.
Listen, you're a great guy. I just...
Yes, yes, I'm great, I know.
But obviously not great enough.
But, never mind. Don't
worry. Everything's fine.
Yes?
Of course. I understand everything.
I'm not stupid.
You love him, don't you?
Yes?
Yes.
Very well.
- I'll explain everything.
- No!
Don't, Tyoma!
- Don't do this, please!
- Rus!
What?
She asked you not to do this.
- I'll do it myself.
- No!
- Let him go!
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Take your hands off me!
- Don't shout!
Stand up!
Tyoma, don't!
- Be quiet!
- No!
Please stop!
Quiet, quiet!
I always knew you weren't
like everyone else.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
No!
Quiet. Don't shout.
I tried to understand what
it is you need, eh?
What it is I could do for you?
Please let him go!
No!
Will you shut up?!
And you don't even need anything.
You just changed me.
Bitch.
Tyoma!
- Look at me!
- He's not human!
Tyoma!
What's wrong?
Check this out.
Tyoma, he's not human!
Give them that thing back
and they'll fly away, please!
They just want to fly away!
You don't speak human, do you?
They're not like we thought.
They're better than us, Tyoma.
Better?
Where are you from? Another galaxy?
From this one.
The constellation of Gemini.
And we are from Chertanovo.
Is he even better than me?
Rus!
Breathe! Rus!
Tyoma, the patrol!
Help him!
Help him!
Shilk can't resurrect the dead.
Don't move! Hands up
where I can see them!
Tyoma, what should we do now?
Gather everyone together!
Yes. Everyone?
Everyone!
These creatures killed Rus.
Well, that's it.
Yeah.
THEY KILLED A MAN!
Let's all meet in an hour!
Look, everybody's going.
Let's go too.
THEY KILLED A MAN!
This is our Earth!
This is our Earth!
Dear passengers...
This is our Earth!
THIS IS OUR EARTH!
Rus and I went to the
same kindergarten.
Our whole life together!
Once we were sent
together to a camp.
We were 10 years old, and so small.
There was a mountain
stream, a steep slope.
Everyone was afraid to jump.
Well, I decided to
show off for the girls.
I took off and jumped.
There was a strong current.
I was immediately carried away.
My legs cramped from the cold.
And Rus jumped after me.
He couldn't swim to save his
life, but he still jumped.
To save me!
Fuck knows what was going on in his head.
He didn't really think
about it at all.
You knew Rus.
In the end, I had to get him out.
We laughed about it for days.
And today I've lost him.
Many of you have lost
their loved ones.
My brother's cousin.
My son's in hospital.
Slava Porogov, from the 9th
floor, is still missing.
And what did they do in the end?
Erect a fence!
Deploy barbed wire!
Soldiers with machine guns!
To protect them, not us!
- They have their orders.
- The hell with them!
They have their orders.
Yeah?
Can't we re-establish order ourselves?
Yes we can!
Or do you prefer to go home?
No!
And wait until someone else is killed!
No!
Are you satisfied with waiting?
No!
And remember.
We didn't attack anyone.
We didn't invite anyone either!
Yes!
This is our Earth!
This is our Earth!
This. Our. Earth!!!
This is our Earth!
This is our Earth!
- Please, wait!
- Out of the way!
Where are you going?
This is our Earth!
I beg you!
Please! We're human beings!
We don't have the right to kill!
We're human beings!
Give me the key to the garage!
- You take the car, Pyth.
- Where are you going?
I'll catch up.
Where are you going?
Tyoma!
Time's running out.
I can stop everything,
but you need to let us go.
- Don't you understand?
- It's pointless.
They have their orders.
They were told to
guard us, so they will.
It's your bad luck. You could
have crashed in Finland.
Be quiet and sit still!
Forgive me, it shouldn't
have been like this.
We shouldn't have come here.
Do you regret it?
Was I not clear enough?
Stop talking!
Let them.
This is our Earth!
This is our Earth! This is our Earth!
- Here we come!
- This is our Earth!
First to Twelfth, First to Twelfth.
We have people here.
Many people!
Citizens!
Disperse immediately!
This is a restricted area!
Citizens! Disperse immediately!
Here we go!
Disperse immediately!
This is restricted area!
Disperse!
Sergei Ivanovich!
That's OK. Go on.
Yes? Speak!
How many?!
Get me Lebedev.
What are you looking at, eh?
What are you looking at me for?
Stop! That's an order!
Stop immediately!
Do not move!
Which side are you on?
Citizens! Immediately
cease any illegal action!
Your actions are illegal!
Forward!
Disperse! Otherwise we'll
have to use force against you.
Come on!!!
Close ranks!
Closer!
The right flank, closer!
Five steps forward!
Five more steps forward!
- Hands off me!
- Colonel!
The body was handed over to the
expert. They found this.
Take them off!
What did you do, Yul?
Me? What did you do?
Security log, space
defence, missile defence...
You're paranoid! You shot them down!
And who are you?
If you get closer, Saul
will blow up the ship!
We'll all die, they and
we, you understand?
Why do you believe him,
and not me?
Because at least he talks to me.
He's not human! We
don't know who they are!
Am I human? Can you listen to me?
Instead of bossing me around?
Why don't you try to understand me?
- I'm trying to!
- Then give us a chance.
We know what to do.
Lebedev.
Valentin, how serious is the situation?
Good, listen.
You are on the spot
so act as you think fit.
I'll take full responsibility!
You have half an hour.
What happens in half an hour?
In half an hour, a new day begins.
I hope so.
Full assault readiness!
You crazy?! You're
going to open fire?!
You fool!
Do you even understand
what's going on?!
Yulia.
Forgive me. I really want to help,
but I've already lost,
I'm afraid.
So, Dad, it's up to me.
Yulia!
Get away from me!
We'll all die. A minute sooner or later,
what's the difference?
Dad. Just trust me, OK?
Car keys, fast!
- Go on!
- The keys!
Follow me!
- Tactical unit, here, now!
- Yes!
Run!
Out of the way!
They're going to blow it up now?
No, Saul's waiting.
He'll wait until the end.
Colonel, may I ask a question?
- Yes.
- Are we really going to open fire?
- What was the order?
- Assault readiness.
- Then get ready!
- Yes!
- No assault whatsoever.
- Yes!
Must give her time.
Die!
We're following Tiger.
Shit!
Avoid collisions!
Back to the vehicles!
They attack people!
We should retaliate!
I love you.
They seem to be retreating.
Nobody moves. Just watch.
Yulia!
Stop!
Lower your weapons!
What are you doing to her?
What are you doing to her?!
Water helps tissue regeneration.
- Who am I talking to?!
- I am Saul, a small research vessel.
You can talk to me.
Will she...
Will she live?
Not for long. Seventy or
eighty Earth years.
- And he?
- Hakon should have lived forever.
But he passed on his life to her.
This is not an exact translation.
- Why did he do this?
- From my point of view,
this was a chain of random events,
with extremely low probability.
You call it fate.
Did he come alone?
- Where are the others?
- The others don't know he flew here.
It is prohibited to visit your planet.
- Why?
- Extremely aggressive social environment.
Despite close to ideal climatic conditions,
Four billion violent deaths
in the last 5,000 years.
Over the same period, about
15,000 major military conflicts.
The complete depletion of resources
and extinction of mankind
is no more than 600 years away.
As I see it, all you plan
to do is live forever, right?
We want to observe.
Contact with undeveloped civilizations
only accelerates their destruction.
Hakon wanted to collect data,
to prove that you were ready for contact.
The results of the mission are negative.
Then there'll be no further attempts?
There is one factor that
could change the forecast.
Which one?
Her.
Her decision doesn't lend
itself to analysis.
I don't understand why she saved Hakon.
And why Hakon decided that
she should live instead of him.
This is not an exact translation.
I will have to reconsider the
results of the mission.
Our common future depends on this.
I must share with the others
what Hakon found out.
And that was... what?
That perhaps there's something
more important than immortality.
This is an exact translation.
We are all looking for a dream,
we are leaving home.
Diving into the depths.
In a circle of strangers,
again to fall, to take off.
Strike out letters, wish and forgive.
To weather our lips, we lose ourselves.
Dismissing comfort, tired of being bored.
According to the people in the
photo, I'm tired of being alone.
Don't melt like butter, but I'll hug you.
I'm back, I'm happy
Open the windows wide.
Wake me with the wind.
Let this city roar.
Our meetings are so rare.
Open the windows wide.
Wake me with the wind.
Let this city roar.
Our meetings are so rare.
They're still talking on TV
about the heroic victory
over the newcomers.
And while the scientists are racking
their brains over the water engines,
people are buying buckwheat,
preparing for the next invasion.
No one notices the most important thing.
One stranger, in the far distant cosmos,
believed in us more than we did ourselves.
Many say that they can't
live as they did before.
I
really can't.
