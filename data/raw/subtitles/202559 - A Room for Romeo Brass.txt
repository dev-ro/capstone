- Yeah
Come on then mate - walk to my truck

You were some help weren't you?
Gavin? Come out now
- Are you alright?
- There's been some trouble down the park
- He's alright mate
- How's your back?
- Bloody hell Romeo, have you been fighting again?
- Are you his Mam duck?
Do I look like his mum?
Well he's been down the park .. just.
Two big lads set about him and I'd to prise them apart.
Come on then Romeo inside
- He needs that seeing to you know
- I can tell
Have you got any TCP [disinfectant]?
If you haven't, you can use hot water with salt in it
- I can come and help if you like?
- No thanks
I don't mind you know. I'm very experienced
with war wounds
I'd like to take you to Scarborough fair
I love you more than my old dead puppy dog
I'll cherish every moment I met you
- Hello
- Hiya
I've just come by, I hope you don't mind.
I'm just checking to see how your brother is.
Romeo? Yeah he's fine, he's not bothered about it anymore
- Seems like a tough kid doesn't he?
- Yeah he's in if you want to see him
I'd like to
- Do you want to come in for a cup of tea then?
- Yeah I'd like to please
Right then
It's my imagination.
 Because I have got a very very fueled imagination
And I thought "You're being silly, Go back to sleep"
So I went back to sleep
And about another forty minutes later
This thing come again and it pushed me
And this time it not only pushed me
It did it so hard it made me do a roley poley
Over. And I knew there and then that there was a spirit in the room
And it was trying to attack me.
So what unfolded then was this fight
Between me and this unseen entity
And it ended up trying ... it pinned me down.
On the floor
It got on top of me with it's knee on my chest
And it was trying to open my mouth
Like that. It was going like this.
And I thought "Oh it's my turn to die"
But then all of a sudden it just disappeared
Like that.
Quick as it come, it disappeared
And I realized then - I don't know if God became involved in it
Or if it was just my stamina and strength alone and my faith
But I believe that I fought an entity, a spirit, my demons
I believe that I fought them and I won.
It's quite late I'm going to get ready for work.
Is it still raining outside?
Well I can give you a lift if you like you know
- No it's alright I'll just walk
- I swear to God it's no bother to me
I'm going that way anyway
- Are you sure?
- Honestly
Well cheers
- Well if you're give her a lift you can give me and Nox a lift to school
- No I don't think so
Oh come on. Please!
Alright then I best get going now anyway Because I've got work
Thanks for the lift anyway
- So this is where you work then is it?
- Yeah
I'd best get going anyway Because I'm going to be late
Before you go I want to tell you a story
if you don't mind
It won't be long please Because I don't want to be late
It's not long it's short.
Do you get me?
- Go on then hurry up
- It's like a question
What if a man came up to you in the street
- Can this wait - sorry
- Honestly it's not long
What if a man came up to you in the street and says to you:
"I would like to spend the rest of my life with you"
Would you think it was weird?
Tell you what I'll think about it work and answer you tonight.
I've really got to go - honestly sorry.
Sorry. See you later.
See you later girls
Fucking hell man
What are you laughing at?
- It's obvious you fancy her you dong!
- I don't fancy her at all
Of course you do
- You're talking such nonsense
- We're not talking nonsense
You can't even lie proper man
Well I might do, a bit yeah
- Might be do a bit ...
- Well you can't blame me can you? She's a lovely looking girl.
- Why don't you ask her out then?
- She likes you too you know
- Do you think so?
- It's just as well you didn't ask her out then, I mean, you know ...
... fifty percent of it is liking her, fifty percent of it is clothes
You could probably get away with your hair but ...
... with clothes like that there's no way she is going to like you.
What's wrong with these clothes man?
It's just ... style isn't it? I know man. I'm your route to her.
- Sweat I said sweat, what have you been doing to sweat that much?
- Oh my god that is so horrible!
I couldn't believe it
What are you doing here?
- I need to know something
- What?
You're supposed to be at school
- It's just about this girl
- oh I ain't got time for this
I just want to know some basic do's and don't's
- Well I ain't got time for it
- oh please it won't take long I just ...
... like what kind of clothes to wear and stuff like that
What was her old boyfriends like then?
- Well I don't know really
- Was he like a big lad? Big lads?
- Yeah big lads, big
- Was he?
Did they come around your house?
- From time to time
- I bet you didn't get on with them did you?
Some of them I did, some I didn't
- What clothes do you like?
- Stuff like that
- You like that? And you don't like shellies or track suits?
- No I do not
- Why not?
- Because I don't!
- You hate them then?
- Yes
- You mean you like them?
- No I don't like them. Fuck off. Go on
Fucking get out now. Get off to school.
But she is pure isn't she? You know what I mean by that don't you?
Oh yeah pure yeah
I'm experienced in things - you know?
I'm getting that feeling already of people having their hands on her ...
.. makes me quite angry I think I've been overcome with love.
So young man .. how did it go then?
From where I was standing and the way she
was laughing and that ...
.. it looked like it was a successful mission
Tell me then man
For crying out loud open up
Oh I'm fucking dying here will you tell me!
Alright keep your hair on
It's the way you put it .. yes .. you know ...
.. I did get all the information out of her
She told me what she liked and what she didn't like
I know she's not going to like what you're wearing now so...
.. you might as well out it in the bin and burn it.
What she does like is eh ...
.. shellies, track suits, trainers ...
.. flip flops, visors, hats, woolly hats, peaked caps ..
.. puffy coats, all the sports stuff - you know what I mean?
Fucking hell boys. You'll not believe what
you're going to see
What I'm going to show you is bigger than Godzilla
And it's bigger than Mohammad Ali
It's taller than a jolly tall tree
It's the new me
What do you think of it?
- It's great
- Spectacular isn't it
- You're going to have all the chicks coming after you
You look inferior!
And you know the thing about it 
I feel so comfy!
It's unreal I dismiss these clothes as puffs
Do you get me?
What do you think Romeo?
Exactly. Lets go.
* Jeering *
I can't destroy you today lads.
I'm on very serious business.
Wanker
Now listen you're not coming in
Got to stand by the door. That's your job. To be the doorman.
Your mission. Do you get me?

- I know the timing was bad
- Yes. Very bad.
Give me my clothes
It's best if you two keep away from me
- It wasn't my fault
- Just stay away from me for hours
Hours of hours
I swear I can't believe you've done that.

Go on then
* Jeering *
Go on Morrell!
Oi steady on !
- So it went well with you and Morell last night?
- No
- Very romantic
- For a start right he's on dole
He's a weirdo. I just felt sorry for him.
You're just being mean now. He really likes you as well.
Romeo you'll understand one day
What's that meant to mean?
Oh God Romeo! I'm just not interested ...
- He's just a bloody gizzoid alright
- That's a cheap shot. Why the hell did you kiss him?
Because I felt sorry for him! You know if Patty Dawes
 asked your to kiss her would you?
No you wouldn't exactly!
No I wouldn't because she stinks of piss, she has long
gums and tiny teeth
I'm killer. I'm Killer. I'm mean. Not all the time.
I'm sometimes nice.
.. I eat fresh meat ...
I don't know why the government is putting so
much money to research these crop circles ...
.. all they have to do is ask me because 
I know all about them
- Crop circles?
- Yeah. What the aliens leave imprinted in the corn
It's not aliens who leave it!
What do you mean aliens who leave it?
It's just the farmers having a bit of fun
It's not aliens, it's the gypsies!
Lads believe! believe! why don't you believe?
- God have you ever heard anything like this Nox?
- I have never heard anything like this
Now listen to this. He's got this mark on his head
Five years later he has a child with a woman
who he didn't know
And this child was born with the same mark on its head
Well what do you think about that? Sinister.
Well it's weird isn't it?
I didn't like it when he just started fighting
just when you wanted a share in it
Okay, I'm sure you're laying that on a bit you know
- What?
- Because sometimes I see you and you're not
 as haunched and struggling
and other times I look at you and you're bent like Quasimodo.
So what's your game?
- Nothing
- What's wrong with your back then?
Nothing
Is it serious or something?
Yeah. You know what's wrong with my back.
I've already told you.
I had a bad back man. And I'll tell you something ...
.. my back was bad ..
If you had what I had, you wouldn't even leave the house.
But I left the house.
It was so bad I broke it in 4 or 5 different places
I broke it .. near my arse
I'll have 3 giant choccy cones please my man
Tell me something man ... serious.
What was the score the other day? With Ladine and
that fucking track suit?
- What do you mean?
- I mean what was it about?
- Nothing. Just bad luck for you
- Bad luck?
Yeah. That was what she told me she liked.
Yeah well how come when I went in the shop ...
.. she just fucking laughed. She didn't like it.
Maybe she changed her mind
I've known her longer than you.
She changes her mind quite a lot.
One minute she likes something, then next minute she don't.
I know you're lying
I know she hated them. I know you made me look
a right fool. I just want to know why you did it.
Why did you do it?
It was just a joke
So it was a joke?
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings though ...
.. it's alright now anyway. You're with her aren't you
- You're going out with her and that
- Just tell me something, you did it for who's pleasure?
Her pleasure? Your pleasure? Who's pleasure did you do it for?
No-one's pleasure
You did it for your pleasure
- Tell me !
- I didn't
Just tell me the truth. I'd rather you tell me the truth
that it was all a joke for your pleasure
- Would you tell me that?
- I didn't do it for my pleasure!
You know you made me look a right fool. Didn't you?
I didn't mean to
Well it wasn't fucking funny was it?
Huh? I don't think you know what it means
to mess with peoples feelings do you?
Your going to learn your fucking lesson man.
You don't mess around with people like that
What have I done to you?
To deserve that?
Fuck all!
Well your little tricks are backfiring man
and it fucking starts here. This is just the beginning.
Do you get me?
Because it's going to go on and on and on
I'm going to make you fucking know what it
feels like now man
I won't stop at you
I'll go into your house, I'll break in
I'll get your mammy and daddy and
fucking tie them to a chair and torture them
and set fire to them and put this through their
fucking guts and twist it

Fine Joe. Fucking fine, move down to the garages

We'll have to stay I suppose
What does that mean?
When I was coming through 'The Golden Grannies'

- oh Jesus Christ!
- Only if he was unconscious
Go in there and tell her something sad about me
Will you tell her how my step mum would
 lock me in a dark box
Anything! I was dropped on my head when I was a kid.
Anything, will you do it?
Just do it man, step to it. Make it sad.
Romeo! Misery ...
- Hi Romes
- Alright?
Alright Romeo?
Before you ask, I've got no money. I'm skint.
Look Ladine please
Please, give him another chance
Romeo, don't start. I'm not interested
- Come on please, do it for me
- I'm not going to discuss it in here
His Mum dropped him down the stairs when he was a baby
The boy is doing good ...

That's it, that's it. Easy.
Smooth, nice and easy.
His step Mum used to sleep with him! Please do it for me.
Please God

- She says she'll think about it
- Ah, I knew it
I fucking knew you'd do it. I knew it!

- What are you talking about?
Oh mother
- How long are you staying?
- Oh not long now
Go on then. Just go bloody watch it!
Ow man! What're you trying to do?
You're trying to aim for my liver
What's the matter with you?
Sorry
How long do people normally visit you for?
An hour
To become a warrior is a very serious business.
You're not born it
Well you could be born it. But you still have to work
hard at it. Do you get me?
And how long have I been here?
A world record time - thirteen minutes
Very good. You're almost too good man. 
You're frightening me.
- Down a bit
- Not so hard eh?
I'm not fucking playing anymore ...
.. I told you not to do it hard didn't I?
- Oh come on man
- No I said it! I told you not to, and you done it
The old kid with a broken heart
Easy you're depressing me
She's been keeping him waiting for ages
She'll be down in a bit. Bloody hell, calm down
It's too long man I'm just getting worse and worse as I'm waiting
Rome? Rome you got a couple of minutes?
I want a word with you
Rome?
Romeo. Two minutes, it's important. Come on
I don't think he want to talk to you does he mate?
- Romeo two minutes
- You're not even supposed to be in here are you?
- Come again?

Carol don't want you to be in here, does she?
It's not your business, but me and Carol have an arrangement
- I can come see my kids whenever I want
- Yeah when she's in the house. But she's not here now is she?
So why don't you get to the back door and talk to him there?
I fucking need you don't I?
Jesus Christ
I just don't think you should be here mate.
So why don't you just leave?
It's obvious Romeo don't want you here isn't it?
You can leave nicely or you can leave horribly, it's up to you.
Do you know what I mean?
- Sorry?
- Do you want to go nicely or would you like to go horribly?
- What are you laughing at?
- Are you going to throw me out?
If I have to yeah, I will throw you out
You're fucking priceless you are!
This is the first time anyone made me laugh in months
I don't know what's so funny man
Listen
I know you're trying to give it large in front of the boy but ..
you know unfortunately
.. I ain't leaving so you're going to have to throw me out.
Romeo. Just grab your bag and you can come stay with me
You don't have to stay with this fucking douche
Just get your bag and stay with me
What you doing hanging around with a prick like him for eh?

- Are you?
- Yeah
- Why don't you just go nicely before things get really dark
What are you laughing for ?
Go on throw me out. Let's see things go really dark.
I can't wait to see things get dark.
Do you think that I'm frightened because you're a big fella?
No obviously not. Obviously you are a big tough guy
- I've fucking ate bigger corn flakes man
- Well do it then
Take it it ain't made you know
- What with children in the house?
- Listen ..

If you're going to call a fight you'd better go through with it.
Otherwise you're going to get hurt
Oh yeah?
- What you're going to hurt me are you?
- Listen .. I know your game
You think I don't know your game?
- What's my game then?
- You some sort of mental deficient upstairs?
What you doing hanging with kids who 
are 10 years younger than you?
What's the matter, you don't hang around with
 people your own age?
What? Do they take the piss out of you?
Do they all laugh at you?
I bet they think you're fucking hysterical don't they?
Or did you get bullied at school? Or are you
 just a fucking nonce?
- Fuck off
- Come near my family I'll fucking bury you!
What the fuck is going on?
It's alright Ladine I'm not going to kick off

- You got to let me explain!
Ladine you don't understand
Ladine

- I'm not surprised you can't cope living with that maniac
- Why don't you just forget about it. It's got nothing to do with you

- I was only trying to do what's right wasn't I?
Yeah I know you were but you can see what he is capable of
- I know he tried to strangle me to death just now
- Yeah well that's what he's like
Forget it
- Will you come out with me?
- I just had an argument with my dad
and you ask me out straight away.
I know but it'll take you mind off all of this won't it?
Yeah I know it will. Just not right now. It's bad timing.
- I'm letting your brother stay with me tonight ain't I?

I'll tell you something now, from the heart
That door is open 24 hours a day
and you are welcome in it anytime

Thanks
I know what it's like man
when you don't get on with your dad
I had a fucking life of it man
Believe me .. I had things done to me 
that I wouldn't even tell you about
I had my head smashed off every fucking wall in this room man
until my ears bled
but I never stopped loving my dad
and giving to him, and trying for him
but he never gave anything back.
There's a saying in life Romeo
don't know if you heard of it: "Look out for number one"
Do you know what that means?
What does it mean then?
- Don't place your trust in anyone else
- Exactly. You don't trust no fucker
Because at the end of the day, you just end up getting hurt
Romeo?
Romeo?
I know you're there
Oh you tosser
Hello

Where you going?
I'm going upstairs.
Where does it look like I'm going?
Look Romeo, I know Morrell is out there waiting.
But I don't want you to go back out tonight.
Why not?
Because I want you to go see your Dad
and help him sort some stuff out
How many times do I have to tell you
I'm not going to help him. I'm not interested.

Couldn't believe it! She's just staring at me for ages
and if she likes me the way that I like her,
and I think she does
you get a great basis for a relationship
"Minnie Ms Lumpy"
"Her arms and legs were stuck on the corners of a square body"
"And she had a large old face which tilted to one side"
"She had an ungainly movement with her arms and legs"
"She shared a table desk with me .."
".. so that I noticed them more than the others"
I like your wallpaper, I used to have that you know ..
