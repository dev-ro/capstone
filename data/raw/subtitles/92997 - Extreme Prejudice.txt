How you doin' there, girl?
How you doing, Hon? You sure lookin' pretty.
You look eye-talian.
You eye-talian, ma'am?
How you doin', cowgirl?
- Can I buy you an ice-cream cone?
- Excuse me.
Come on, baby, I'm buyin' pralines
and cream for everybody, girl.
Don't get insulted.
As long as I got a face,
you got a place to sit.
Hi. Yeah. Is Rhonda there?
My friend Leron told me to call you.
He said if I'm ever in town...
to call you, and we could get together
and do the right thing.
Fry, I got this close
to getting some fee-fee!
I heard
you're in the Philippines.
- Yeah. Subic Bay and before that, Manila.
- They put me in Turkey, man...
on recon-intel.
Put me in the middle of nowhere.
Can you believe that?
- Dip me in shit and roll me in sugar, man!
- How you doin', you uncouth asshole?
Who you calling uncouth, man?
I'm couth as hell, baby.
- Where are you in from?
- Panama. What about you?
Germany. I was working out of Cologne
the last 6 months.
- Getting tired of that German pussy?
- Noch nicht, mein Herr.
- At least I get it without payin' for it.
- What the hell you talking about, man?
This time, you got it easy, Greyboy.
Just sit back and watch how I operate.
- Mr. Biddle.
- Coker.
What's he gonna learn from you,
Luther, how to lift weights?
You got invited
to this one, huh?
Yeah. Somebody's got to look out
for bad-asses like you...
so they went out and got the best
butt kicking non-com in the business.
Everything okay, sergeant?
- No problem.
- No problem. Just sortin' things out.
This is 3.7 0.
Roger, central on 10-14.
That orange pickup
is T.C. Luke's.
That's what come through the border crossin'
where they cut the fence.
Luke brothers, all right.
Having a little celebration
'fore they go home with the dope.
Beats the hell out of me
how could they lose that bucket of bolts...
even in this rain.
The only time the border patrol
wins hot pursuit is when they get laid.
Tell your boys to get here quick.
They get wind of us, they're gone.
Christ, there goes Chub
right now.
- Central. Come in, central.
- I don't want to lose T.C., too.
Tell the border patrol that Chub
and the VW's headed back their way.
- Go ahead.
- This is Hank out on highway 9...
with Jack Benteen
at Rincon Norte.
Tell the border patrol
that Chub Luke is coming our way.
Right; Sher/ﬂ: calling border patrol now.
Rincon Norte.
You get out here on the double.
- I want T.C. Luke.
- No entiendo. No hablo inglés.
- T.C. Luke, I said. c'Aqui?
- Ya 
e dije, seﬁor. No hablo inglés.
Hello, Jack.
You sure come to the right place
to get in out of the rain.
Say adios to the lady, T.C.
You're goin' with me.
You'll find they fit.
Get into 'em.
How much help
you got outside, Jack?
How much help
you think I need, T.C.?
You're pushin' me hard, Jack.
You're working me.
- It's your choice.
- Wait a minute.
Now, you look here.
I'm just a poor old dirt farmer.
It ain't right, Jack,
your tryin' to take me in.
I'm just tryin' to make some money
at something besides choppin' cotton.
Save your plea
for the courthouse, T.C.
It ain't right, Jack.
I said, it ain't right!
Hold it!
No se muevan!
Don't nobody move
unless you want some of this.
Make yourself useful.
Pick it up.
Put it on the table!
Now dump it out on the table!
Put your hands on your head.
Come over here.
I figured pig shit like you
for pearly grips.
You son of a bitch.
Murdering bastard!
You lousy god damn
son of a bitch...
Too late, amigo, to hold your tough talk.
You had your chance.
Thanks, Jack.
Just like old times.
Con permisso, seﬁores y seﬁoritas.
Buena noche.
Buenas dias, amigo.
Nice to see you again.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
- That's okay.
I'm glad you did.
The hours we work, we need to make
an appointment weeks in advance...
- just to say hello.
- Yeah, it kind of seems that way, don't it?
Why don't you go get yourself a Tequila
or a beer or something?
Why don't you tell me
what's wrong?
A fella pulled down on me
in the Rincon Norte last night.
He's dead.
Just another raggedy-ass dirt farmer gone broke
trying to hold on to his piece of the world...
by runnin' dope across the border
for Cash Bailey.
Yeah, that's them.
A 1950 mud-brown, beat-to-shit
Chevy truck with no hubcaps.
Unbelievable. We finally got some recon
that's worth a good God damn.
Two suitcases.
Log the time of arrival.
Christ. I don't know how
much more I can handle.
Then you'll just have to open
up more banks, Clarence.
- Expand. Think big.
- Yeah, real god damn easy for you to say.
You don't have the feds
looking at your books.
- Where's Andy?
- Andy? He'll be in in about 10 minutes or so.
We just opened up.
He'll be here in a while.
That's good...
'cause I'm bringing Andy this nice rabbit.
c'Que bonita, huh?
- Jack Benteen, Texas Ranger.
- Yeah, a big son of a bitch, ain't he?
- You thinkin' about takin' him on?
- Might be fun.
- Always did hate cops.
- What have you got against cops?
- Once, one hit me.
- And?
- He died.
- You snuffed a cop?
Nah. His mother-in-law
backed over him by mistake in her LTD...
which is why I like fords.
Hey, Andy. Look at this.
Tell him I'm gonna bust his ass for sellin' dope
if he doesn't do what I want.
That's not a threat,
that's a promise.
Tell him
to go across the border...
and tell his supplier
that I want to see Cash Bailey.
Tell him I want to meet Cash
on his side of the river.
I'll be waiting at the old blind
where we used to hunt deer.
Tell him
I'll be there at 12 noon.
If it don't go right, I don't know
what I can hit at the distance...
with this cut-down thing.
Hold down on 'em about 8 inches high
and you'll hit 'em right in the chest.
- I'll put on a good show.
- Real western.
Yes, sir.
Buenos dias.
Give me your gun, man.
I don't give up my gun
without somebody gettin' hurt.
iBuenos dias!
Hey!
Just let him alone, boys.
Back off.
Remember him from
"Monday night football"?
He was an all-star, hombre.
- I believe it.
- I hurt my knee.
Looks like you hurt your head.
Long time no see, stranger.
You're lookin' good. Trim.
Old hell-raiser Jack
and his best buddy Cash.
Come on. Let's get to it.
Still live in that house
your granddaddy built?
Oh, yeah.
I ain't finished it yet, either.
You remember
old Sally Deegan...
that terminated our mutual virginity
out behind old George Fletcher's barn...
in the night of the senior dance?
You remember?
Three rounds each.
You never once took off your tux
or your damn gardenia!
- Where is old Sally now?
- She's up in Salt Springs teachin' third grade.
Oh, hell...
We all move on, don't we?
What's on your mind, Jack?
I know you didn't come down here to tell me
how good-lookin' I still am.
I come over to talk about the bomb
that went off yesterday.
I got two people dead.
Yeah, well...
You know, I heard that
one fellow got killed...
was unreliable.
Liked to cheat his partners.
Liked to hold out on 'em.
Did you get a look at that?
You ought to pick you up one of these things.
The son of a bitch is great.
You mount a cannon on her or rack you
up some bombs, if that's your thing...
and go hunt some god damn hogs!
Hell, Jack, I know you're pissed,
but this is me and you.
We rode the river together.
Now, personally,
I'd just be tickled pink...
if we could work out something,
save us both a world of grief.
We ought to work together.
You could be a hundred-thou-a-year man
right now, and I'm the man that pays.
You can buy me, Cash.
Hell, you always could...
but you can't buy the badge.
One without the other ain't no god damn good.
What in the hell else we gonna
do, partner, shoot each other?
If it was me, Cash, I'd haul ass.
Now, that's what I'm telling you.
You can haul ass, close up your shop,
get out while the getting's good.
Now, I'm offerin' you that.
I'll tell you
what I think, Jack:
I think maybe I should just give
more of my money to charity.
Boy scouts, united fund,
Houston Symphony Orchestra.
Maybe you quit tryin' to be a third-generation
Ranger with a spit-shine heart.
- Quit sellin' dope, Cash.
- You don't understand. They want it, Jack!
They like the stuff!
Hell, I use it myself
on occasion.
You cross the river,
your ass is mine.
I wouldn't go talking that bad talk, Jack,
makin' old Cash mad.
You're on the wrong side
of the river.
Tax-free. Did I mention that?
- By the way, how's Sarita?
- She's fine, Cash. Just fine.
- Still singin' pretty as ever?
- Pretty as ever.
So I heard. I always
thought we messed that up.
I always thought I should've married
that damn gal, even if she was a Mexican.
I didn't come down here
to talk about her, Cash.
Now drop it! The whole god damn thing!
You walk away and you leave it!
I'm in, son.
I can't do that.
You know, Jack...
I got a feeling the next time we run into
each other, we're gonna have a killin'.
It's just a feelin'.
See you around.
Sir, I know
you don't speak English very well...
but the state requires
that you fill out this form.
Would you do that, for me,
please, and take it to...
How's everybody doin'?
How you all doin'?
How you doin'?
How you doin' there, Hoss?
What's everybody tryin' for?
You know, baby, like what kind of job
you tryin' to get, huh?
Was working on the highway
till I got laid off.
How about you, brillo top?
Hey, boy! What kind of job
you possibly hopin' you gonna get, huh?
- You talkin' to me?
- Uh-huh. I'm talking to you.
- Brain surgeon, asshole.
- Where I come from...
we don't take to no nigger faggots
callin' us no asshole.
You callin' me a nigger faggot?
I don't see any other nigger faggots
behind you there, brother.
- I guess I am calling you a nigger faggot, huh?
- Honkie piece of shit.
Excuse me. Could you direct me
towards the president?
- He's right over there.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- I'd like to speak to the president.
- Clarence W. King, sir. May I be of service?
- Could we talk in private?
- Concerning?
Your safekeeping facilities.
You looked pretty good out there today.
Made it look real convincin'.
Only reason I didn't whip your big old black ass
'cause we supposed to wind up in jail...
- instead of the hospital.
- Anything you say, Buck...
but say it in the Mike.
You're wired.
How's it hangin', Charlie?
All right, here it goes. Communications:
J 6 telephones,
all central/y switched.
Armaments are as follows:
Pump shotguns, JZ-Gauge, 5... Riﬂes... J 4.
.70 30-ca/iben.. 4 30-aught-6.
Tear gas... .70 canisters.
No shields, no vests.
Ammunition all stored in a green locker
bearing photograph circa J 954...
Jayne Mansﬁeld
My summary is as follows:
If'n a cowboy gets drunk,
these boys is ready.
Five tellers on the left. Open counters.
There's an exit behind the president's desk.
- What about video?
- Two cameras, alarm-activated.
One at the front entrance,
the other one's in front of the vaults.
There's two vaults,
Chambers Reilly.
The one on the right has the money,
the one on the left has the safe deposit boxes.
- So what's the bad news?
- The vaults are on a time lock.
They don't open up till 20 minutes
before business.
We're gonna have to blast
if we go in tonight.
I know you Texas Rangers
prefer to work alone...
and you don't really want any help
from old county sheriffs...
but I thought maybe
I'd do a little research.
- What'd you find out?
- Ain't nothing there we don't already know.
Left Benrey eight years ago,
lit out for Mexico.
Just before you come home
when your daddy died.
Five years later, shows up
and D.E.A. reports he's a big drug dealer.
Got his own private army.
Bought off nearly every politician in Mexico.
Shows up here, there,
whenever he wants.
No known residence. Just flies around
in that big old helicopter of his.
Hell, we grew up together
best friends.
Played on the same football team,
dated the same girls...
- even smoked some loco-weed together.
- No shit. You did?
- Yeah, we did.
- I didn't catch you?
Hell, no.
We wouldn't let you catch us.
We fooled you, fooled my pop,
fooled you all!
You and damn Cash, huh?
Christ. Look at him today in that white suit.
And that Mexican he had dressed up
like pancho villa's army.
He's still damn play-actin'
like he's still a kid.
Yeah, well,
it's gone past that, Hank.
Funny, ain't it,
how it comes around?
The right way's the hardest.
The wrong way's the easiest.
Rule of nature...
like water seeks the path
of least resistance.
So you get crooked rivers
and crooked men.
I still like him.
I'm still tryin'
to scount him my friend.
Smartest crooks always did know
how to get to a man inside.
Women, too, as far as that goes.
Jack, you look out for old Chub Luke
on the way home. You hear me?
I'm telling you,
he's gonna try to bushwhack you...
or I ain't half as smart
as I think I am.
Yes, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I was asleep
when you got here last night.
Yeah. I had a hard day.
What happened with Cash?
How did you know about that?
You gringos never learn.
You beat up one of us,
word gets around quick.
We didn't hurt him none.
We just roughed him up a little.
Come on, Jack.
What about Cash?
He said his piece. I said mine.
We left it at that.
- He said anything about me?
- Nope.
éNada?
I just told you. Nada.
What the hell do you mean
that he didn't say nothing?
That's not the way he is.
He talks all the time.
He must have said plenty so you
don't forget, he was with me first.
You don't understand!
Now, I don't want to talk about this!
What do you mean,
you don't want to talk about this?
I'm talking to you. You gotta talk back,
even if you don't want to!
You think you're so big
and so good, don't you?
Let me tell you something.
You know nothing.
Cash, he used to be
so good to me.
Maybe you should've
stayed with him.
Jack, I need to know...
I want to know where you and me are going
and how long it's gonna take us to get there.
You're a man of your word,
aren't you?
- So what's your word?
- Don't push me.
Push you?
Don't push you?
After two years of climbing in and out
of your bed, I'm gonna push you?!
God. Sometimes, I think
you're one fucked-up gringo.
That's our console, okay?
That there puts you in contact
with your mobile units.
Will somebody out there find out
where Chub Luke's mother lives?
- Yes, sir. We're working on it.
- Morning!
What's good about it?
Hell I said "morning."
I didn't say good morning.
- What you in a fine mood about?
- I've been in for 20 minutes...
and I'm already
having a terrible God damn day.
- You want to tell me about it?
- No.
I had a fight with Sarita.
Had a fight with her about Cash.
Seems like he's in every part
of my god damn life!
Well, you know that Sarita went with him
before you ever asked her out.
Don't seem hardly right to
hold it against her, does it?
- Of course, it's not really my business, is it?
- No, it ain't.
Chub's mother lives
just past John friendly on 102.
- Sheriff?
- What?
We just got a tip.
There's some new faces showed up at Arturo's.
- Sharpe's crossing.
- Yes, sir.
There's a buy going down.
Cash's boys are doin' business.
Let's stick our nose in.
Then we'll go see
if Chub's at his mother's.
- Hold down the fort, son.
- Yes, sir.
You know, usually,
you could reason with a drunk...
kids on loco-weed
or a couple that was fightin'.
You could cool 'em down.
Next day, they'd thank you for it.
Not now, boy.
They get wired, they stay wired.
Smack, snort, pill-poppin' dopes.
Take them Luke boys —
the one that drew on you...
and his brother Chub —
runnin' with scum.
Christ. I used to fish with their dad.
They were sweet kids.
Not mad dogs like they turned out to be,
trying to bite you.
We follow this cowboy,
work up a profile on him.
That way we'll know what we got
if we ever have to deal with him.
If we hit this bank in daylight,
we're gonna need a big diversion.
- We'll blow something up.
- Yeah, like what?
A building, barn, something.
- A school, a church. Something.
- What, are you particular?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.
This is America. There are legal channels.
File for a writ and
subpoena the bank or something.
We're robbing the bank to cover what we're
gonna get out of the safety deposit boxes.
- This is a case of national security.
- Right.
So if we do the bank,
it looks like just another bank robbery.
- You got it.
- You know, Hank...
the next thing
you're gonna be complainin' about...
the state legislature
makin' women rangers, you know that.
I don't care...
long as she's 6'6",
mean as a snake.
State legislature...
Shit, Jack!
Only thing worse than a politician
is a child molester.
What's doin', Arturo?
éQue pasa?
Four guys inside my place.
I think maybe they could be mules.
- Anglo or Mex?
- Si, mejicanos.
They waiting here all morning
drinking beer.
Somebody else come. Big. Gots a beard.
They call him Chub.
That's who we want.
You ain't gonna just walk in there,
are you?
Hell, I've known Chub
since the third grade.
You were just tellin' me
what a nice kid he used to be.
- I'm just gonna go in and have a beer with him.
- Shit. Sounds reasonable.
Just sit down, talk to him about how
you shot his brother the night before last.
I'm goin' around the back way.
I'll stay out here with Arturo
and watch the front.
- Right, sir?
- Yes, sir.
Arturo, get right over there
where I can keep an eye on you.
No problem.
Jack!
Jesus Christ...
Payback time, Jack!
Garza!
He's over behind the Chevy!
Move on him!
The bad guys.
How y'all doin'?
We're a surveying group
for the county assessor. We're...
We're not trespassers.
We're not trespassing, man,
honest.
I don't care who you are.
We need that wagon of yours.
Just in case you don't get the message
real clear, he says we need it, too.
- Take the station wagon. There's no problem.
- I think you wanna tell.
- 5 kilos?
- Yes, sir.
Keep the perimeter sealed.
Anything else you find, photograph it,
bag it, take it on home.
Right, sir.
Be careful with him.
Get the ID. number of that mother.
Excuse me, sir,
Shouldn't we send all of it up to Austin?
- Send half to Austin. I'm gonna keep the rest.
- Yes, sir.
And, uh, sir, uh...
Well, me and the guys...
- I mean, about Hank...
- He was a damn good man, Cortez.
He was like a father to me.
- Hello. Clarence king speaking.
- Howdy, Clarence. Merv here. How’s things?
No problems. How's
things down south?
0h, lots of sun. That’s all we got down here.
Lots of sun and lots of money.
Speaking of which, we ’re coming down
Tuesday morning, about 10:00.
We got two suitcases.
Look, I told you and I'm telling Cash Bailey,
I can't handle this much...
Shut up, Clarence. Damn it.
You ’re in this thing up to your ass
and you ain ’1' got a choice.
You be ready Tuesday.
Mr. Benteen?
Frank Ralston, D.E.A.
I'm point man for a task force
sent down here...
to investigate volume drug-trafficking
along your part of the border.
Good luck.
If you've got a moment,
I could use a little information.
Try the phone book.
Well, maybe you don't understand.
This is official business.
- I expect a little cooperation.
- Ralston...
I expect
you to stay out of my way.
I didn't hear myself
givin' you an invitation, mister.
I'm particular who I drink with.
Why don't you
cut the horseshit?
I'm conducting an investigation.
I need your help.
Just maybe you could use some of mine.
I got juice in Washington.
Bunch of bureaucratic fat asses
fluffin' their duff.
They been sittin' on my request
for drug information for over a year...
but it's classified.
They're afraid somebody or some country's
gonna get their feelings hurt.
So by now, my file's the size
of a god damn phone book.
When I get back to Washington,
I can guarantee...
that anything you send up
will get top priority.
In the meantime, I need every bit of evidence
you've got on those two drug dealers...
that were killed this afternoon.
Tell you where to start:
Cash Bailey.
He's been polluting this town
for three years.
He's turned it
into a sewer of drugs.
The last few days
are all his doin'.
This drug tip,
turned out it was a set-up.
Took the life of the local sheriff.
Never been a better and never will.
He died goin' forward.
That means a hell of a lot down here.
All the more reason why you and I
should work together.
Take a look at that.
Can't figure the markings
on the shell casings.
How soon with your juice
from Washington?
- 24 hours.
- Make it 24 hours, Frank.
Hell, that'll impress me.
Jack.
You watch me sing,
and you don't even say hello?
You want to talk about Hank?
I heard about it
just about an hour ago.
I know how much you liked him,
how much you cared for him.
- You want to tell me about it?
- I don't want to talk about this.
I can't talk about it.
I gotta do something about it.
But you gotta let it out, Jack.
Just like with you and me,
I think it's better if we talk.
I didn't think you had anything more
to say to me.
For two years,
I tell you I love you.
Now we don't talk.
What's the matter, Jack?
I know you.
We've had fights before,
but this time, it's different.
It's not like you.
We gotta give it a rest,
the talk, all of it.
You don't want to be
with me anymore?
No. I didn't say that.
I just said we have to give the talk a rest.
You, me, and Cash,
it's too hard.
- It's gonna get too God damn complicated.
- Yeah...
For you, Jack,
but what about me, huh?
Someday
you're gonna want me, Jack.
You don't know a good thing
when you got it.
Just sign right there
and we'll get you out of here.
Yes, sir.
It'd be my pleasure, sir.
- You're lucky you got friends.
- You're right about that.
In this world, that's one damn thing
you need is friends.
I don't want to see you
around here no more.
Hell, no, Deputy, not me.
You can color me gone, baby.
Hell. A bunch of faggots...
How you doin', Luther?
- Let's go, Sergeant.
- Guess what, Buck.
They're gonna reprogram us,
wire us up again.
- It's a daylight hit.
- What?
Com op special, Buck.
- Is this for real, man?
- It's for real. Daylight hit.
Daylight hit...
With the light, man, some people's
gonna get themselves killed.
Yeah, well, Buck, don't tell us, man.
Tell Hackett.
Damn it, Larry, man.
How the fuck you figure it, man?
I don't figure it, Sergeant.
I follow orders.
What are you waitin' on, soldier?
So y'all keep your eyes peeled,
c'esta bien?
I figure the reason why they got me down here,
showing you the conduits...
because they probably want
me to do some blasting somewheres.
Yeah. This reminds me
of that job we did in Bangkok.
Yeah, I remember, buddy.
Here we go, brother.
The first thing you got to do
is pop the cover.
- Look at these little wires over here.
- Shit! Rats.
You call that a rat, man?
If it's rats you want,
Managua, baby.
I mean, Managua got some
real bad rats, man.
I'm talking 4-, 5-pounders.
Their ass like a dog.
Pay attention, brother.
What you do is you come on over here
and you cut this blue boy.
You got it?
Well, let's move.
Would I come over
on this side of the river...
maybe take a chance of getting
my cojones blown oh: if I didn ’1' want you?
- Ain ’t too smart.
- No, it ain ’t.
So let’s you and me vamonos.
I got this place in Durango
up in the hills.
Way back in the middle of nowhere.
It's real nice.
It's almost like it must've been,
say, 50, 60 years ago.
And by God,
they treat old Cash like a king.
For how long you gonna call me amor
before you tell me "adios, mejicana"...
- like the other time, Cash?
- It'll be different this time, darling.
I come to get you tonight
to get you for keeps.
See, I had a talk with Jack
a couple of days ago, we talked about you.
It brought
all them good memories back.
All the women I ever been with,
you're the best.
Now, you come on down
to my place in Mexico, honey.
We 7/ have us a real good time,
just like the old days.
Get your mind oﬂr your troubles.
Next week, we ’re gonna have us
a big ﬁesta.
Independence day.
Besides, you want to see
how old Cash is doin', don't you?
Well, he ’s doin ’ just ﬁne.
Real interesting.
- Purvis, get my cartridge headstamp catalogue.
- Yes, sir.
- FBI or CIA, sir?
- CIA. Bring that.
That'll have
more of them foreign listings.
Thought they were doing
this in Austin, sir.
They are, but as usual, they're gonna take
their sweet damn time about it.
I even got a DEA. fella
runnin' it through Washington.
- Washington? How 'bout that?
- Yeah,
But who knows when
they're gonna get off their asses.
Here. Take a look at this.
51, that's one from the bastards
that killed Hank.
Now look at this one.
Here. 43.
That come from the dirt road
where Chub and the Mex got it.
43 BRM. Different headstamp,
different lettering...
different markings
on the cartridge case.
They could've loaded them magazines
with different kinds of ammo.
It's possible, but highly unlikely.
This 43, I can't find it
listed anywhere.
Looks Canadian,
but there's no entry for it.
- I don't know... I don't know.
- Yes, sir.
Maybe I can help.
It's a 9.3 mil from West Germany
through Montreal. BRM.
It's distributed here by H&R.
It's special,
but it's not that special.
Looks like Cash is buyin'
foreign arms and ammo...
for that private army
he's supposed to have.
Then he sends his boys across the border
to do his god damn dirty work.
You've really got it in for Bailey.
Thanks.
I need all the help I can get.
Anytime, Jack.
- Real nice fella.
- Yep.
The video scan can be shorted out
by cutting this conduit here.
In case of a backup battery,
that'll short out the whole system...
- and there can't be a secondary alarm.
- Okay, listen up!
Coker, get the door.
I think it's about time
we cut orders for assignments.
It's absolutely imperative that
this job look like a civilian operation.
Op order number 1,
and nobody break it:
Maintain radio silence
from go to finish. Is that clear?
Op order number 2:
All assignments are to be started
and completed on time.
Anybody that breaks this schedule
will put this whole operation in jeopardy.
Op order number 3:
When your assignments are completed,
signal home.
Biddle and I will be stationed
at the target area.
We'll cue the countdown
from there.
You're hot.
Package 1 delivered, 0950.
This is 645 to Benrey.
- Deputy Purl/is.
- Purvis, what went up?
An old storage warehouse on Flaxton, sir.
Big explosion.
Who's covering?
Cortez went out of here a few minutes back.
Scrambled out with three units, sir.
On my way.
- 0958.
- Package 2, go.
Deputy Purvis.
- Donna Lee, is your phone workin'?
- No, honey, lines are all dead.
Give him a call, Maj.
- Tony, come here!
- Yeah. What do you want?
- They're out of business.
- Damn phone company!
Trust 'em to screw up our lines
in the middle of an emergency.
1000 hours.
Look out, man!
- Man! Fuck!
- There's the boys.
Package 3.
- Send for radio help!
- We gotta maintain radio silence!
- Come on! Call 'em anyway!
- Push!
This whole fucking thing
is fucked up, man!
Okay, everybody down!
Down, down, down!
Move! Everybody up front!
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
Down, down, down!
Cash Bailey's deposit box.
- Honest...
- Want to die for Cash Bailey?
Over there, number 14.
- You bunch of honky rednecks, get down!
- You boys terrorists, ain't you?
Kiss the floor, cowboy!
It's open.
What are you afraid of?
Fire it up, man.
You got front-wheel drive, and you're level.
Don't blow it this time,
motherfucker.
Come on, man!
Come on.
Drive the motherfucker!
God damn it, come on!
Let's go!
645 to Benrey.
Purvis, do you read?
645 to Benrey.
- Don't take all day, Merv.
- That girl will wait for you.
But I can't.
I been savin' up for her all week.
Five minutes
isn't gonna hurt you any.
Two suitcases.
- Come on, Sergeant!
- Moving. We're moving.
Let's see some of that fucking speed
you always mouthing off about!
- Shut up, Atwater!
- Move it!
You better get off of my shit,
you ugly fat fuck...
- or I'm gonna kick your ass...
- Fuck you, you faggot.
Shut up!
Okay, amigo,
you just keep sittin' there.
In exactly one minute, you're gonna get
a gun shoved up your ass by old Buck.
Make a hole! Make a hole!
Suitcases!
Cabron!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go!
- We should have had cover, Major.
- Well, you tell him that. Where were they?
God damn it.
God damn it!
We're dogged, man,
we're dogged!
What are we doing here?
We're in Texas, for chrissake!
Damn it!
We're doin' what we're supposed to do.
You just keep your mouth shut.
He's right on us, man!
Put the damn gun down,
soldier!
It's only us, Ranger.
Same old same.
- Get what I wanted?
- Yes, sir.
I lifted these prints
off the 2655 at the morgue.
That's the Mexicans
and the blacks.
And here's their booking slips:
Buck Schoonover and Paul Kenner.
- Thanks, Cortez.
- Right, sir.
Everything's bagged and tagged
and under lock and key, sir.
All right.
Send these to the FBI in Washington.
- Let me know the minute we get word back.
- Right, sir. Get right on it.
Oh, and, sir... We got word from
Ranger Ballistics in Austin.
The bullets was army issue,
Special Forces.
That's why they didn't show up in that catalogue
because they keep it secret and all.
That stuff that shot Chub Luke,
that batch...
was reported stolen 8 months ago
from an army base in Prentiss, Oregon...
which means that that fella from the DEA.
must have made a mistake.
- Either that or he damn well lied to us!
- Probably lied...
I want you to get me through to Washington
Federal Drug Administration, personnel office.
- Right away.
- Yes, sir. Right away.
Oh, sir.
FBI fellas that just got here...
they want your form 407
and your form 800.
They also want your work history reports
for the last two years.
Plus, they say
the coke machine's empty.
Tell the FBI to kiss my ass.
Get on those prints.
"Kiss my ass." Yes, sir.
We fucked up.
We were supposed to be there
to cover the spic. We fucked up.
- Luther was a friend of mine.
- He was a friend of mine, too, man.
But he's dead.
That's the way it goes when you're a soldier.
You just bite the damn bullet
and just move on, man.
Man, right now, we just got to figure some way
to get out of this place...
and get on
with this damn mission.
Yeah... the mission.
Here we are,
space-age, high-tech...
and we get caught
by some stone-age cowboy.
Yeah... Texas Ranger, no less.
Oh, man...
- Thanks. Never heard of him!
- Sir?
Frank Ralston - the D.E.A.'s
never heard of the damn guy.
- So how long are we supposed to wait?
- Till he gets here.
And how long's that?
I don't know.
You got someplace else you got to be?
No. I got a truckload full of cash
and every cop in the state looking for us!
So what?
They ain't lookin' for you, anyway.
Why the fuck did the ops call for me
to drive off and leave my buddy exposed?
I was parked on his flank.
I could have shot him and then drove off!
You did your job, Sergeant.
The objective was secured.
The whole thing went smooth
until Fry got careless.
- He died stupid.
- Come on, Larry.
If coker would have sneezed,
he'd have been late.
The ops was too tight!
Now, you know that and I know that!
Fry knew it, too.
Command is not supposed to put us
in those kind of situations!
Command always puts us
in those situations!
What the hell do you think
we're here for!
Yeah.
Still don't change the fact
that my buddy's in a body bag.
He ain't in Lebanon or Honduras.
Fucking Texas!
Personnel report
from the army, sir.
It's kind of wild.
"Please be advised:
Sergeant Declan Patrick Coker,
561-56-7441...
4th battalion,
First Infantry Division...
killed on leave from Lebanon
in chartered flight crash...
12-14-84, unmarried."
Here's another one.
"Sergeant Buck Atwater,
433-88-1755,
killed while defusing unexploded bomb,
Laos, 11-11-74...
buried,
US. Armed Forces Cemetery, Hawaii...
posthumous bronze star medal,
and no next of kin."
We got one more:
"Sergeant Fry, first infantry division,
Fort Benning,
killed, maneuvers,
Fort Polk, Louisiana...
10-25-77,
and no next of kin."
Recognize this fella?
These two got themselves tossed in jail
so they could check us out.
How can they be officially dead
and two of them locked up in there?
File it.
File the whole damn thing, Cortez!
Right, sir.
Where did you serve
in the army, Buck?
I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about, Ranger.
I ain't never been
in no damn army.
Got me a bum knee, sir.
Suppose you didn't serve either?
Stayed home with your mom
and stole cars?
No, sir. I sold dope,
so I bought cars.
You boys
have a lot to think about.
Better have some
God damn answers tomorrow.
- Stand guard, Purvis.
- Yes, sir.
With a shotgun!
Paco! Where's Sarita?
Gone. She come in and say she go
with an old friend to Mexico.
Gracias.
I'm unarmed.
I'm Major Paul Hackett,
173rd Airborne...
third battalion.
If you run a check on me...
You'll end up dead
like those other two I got locked up.
What the hell's the military
robbin' banks in Texas for?
Cash Bailey.
He's using the bank here in Benrey
to launder and stockpile his drug money...
to store documents
that would embarrass our government...
if they
were ever made public.
You got to do a hell of a lot better
than that, mister.
For over 5 years, Cash Bailey was the D.E.A.'s
number-one deep cover informant in Mexico.
Three years ago, he turned.
He parlayed
what he knew into a drug empire.
That was a hell of a nifty trick,
havin' your boys listed as bein' dead.
- It helps when we're doing work overseas.
- Unless you get caught.
I'm goin' into Mexico.
I'm gonna finish this job.
My intelligence sources tell me that Bailey
crossed the border again last night.
And I think he's gone back
to Mexico with your lady.
Give me back my men.
We'll all just slip over the border.
And in a couple of days,
we'll glide into Bailey's town.
I'll give you 30 minutes with him
before I move in.
- It's what you want, isn't it?
- Yeah. That's exactly what I want.
All I want are some documents
that are in his possession.
- Purvis!
- Yes, sir. Trouble, sir?
No. Go on home.
I'll hold the fort.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hell of a day, sir...
Never did figure out
what happened to those damn phones.
Go home and get some sleep.
See you in the morning, sir.
Better call your boss.
- You're goin' to Mexico.
- Yes, sir.
I think it's time you
and I got a couple of things straight.
- What do you got in mind?
- Well, you're used to working freelance.
On this operation, you do as you're told,
like a good soldier.
I'll do my best, Major.
You know, Benteen, you're in for a real treat
watching these boys go to work.
Take Larry over there, Sergeant McRose.
He's not your everyday soldier.
You put him out when the sun goes down,
you get body count.
You wake up in the morning,
and Larry's drinking orange juice...
in front of a fresh pile of ears.
You know what I think, man?
I think we're heroes.
And heroes need a cause, man, only nowadays,
everything's so damn messed up.
Ain't nobody can see
anything clear anymore.
So I support my country, man.
That's what I got.
I got my country,
and I got my buddies, and that's it.
- I don't ask no questions.
- Scotch, single malt?
- No, thank you.
- What, you don't drink whiskey?
I'm particular who I drink with.
I don't believe that, Benteen.
I think
you're just naturally hostile.
Yeah...
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking we lost Fry.
You blame command.
You blame me.
Am I right?
If I'm right,
I want to hear it.
You're right. It sucks, sir.
You know, Major, ain't none of us like it,
but we do what we have to do...
and you know we do it good.
We all miss Fry.
I miss Fry.
You little fuck,
you remember that.
Yes, sir.
Last time out, we fucked up...
lost one of our own.
We got a lot to make up for.
Let's do it for Luther.
We owe him that much.
I said I'd give you 30 minutes.
You got it.
One minute more
and we're comin' in.
That's all I need.
You gonna take on all them Uzis
by yourself there, sir?
Hell, I'm gonna walk in there.
We used to be old friends.
Good luck there, Hoss.
That Ranger there,
he's one crazy mother...
but I do like the way
he do his stuff, man.
Buck, shut the fuck up!
This is no time for testimonials
to the Ranger.
Our objective here
is Cash Bailey.
Termination
with extreme prejudice.
Excepting members of this immediate family,
there are no friendlies.
The cowboy's a friendly.
He let us out of jail.
- Why do we have to kill him, Major?
- I repeat:
Excepting members of this immediate family,
there are no friendlies.
Hey, Major, you sure you're not gonna
hang out to dry on this one?
I'm gonna follow orders, Biddle.
Very unusual.
What is?
Ordering the termination
of an American civilian peace officer...
clearly loyal to the country...
and in the process
of bringing a known criminal to justice.
But we're going to do as we're told.
Right, Sergeant?
Right, Major.
Machine gun emplacements.
We'll need to take them out.
Twin 30.
Lower west quadrant.
Twin 30.
Lower east quadrant.
Another twin 30,
upper north quadrant.
This Independence Day bullshit's
gonna go on for hours.
Use the crowd cover
to make your way up to the hotel.
There's Bailey.
Well, well, well, there he is.
You all be careful, now.
He's a snake, that old boy.
Grab him by the tongue
and pull it till it pops.
Then we'll know what we got.
How you doin', Jack?
I figured you'd show up
sooner or later.
You come for me
or did you come for Sarita?
I come to take you both home.
That'd be the best
all the way around.
You can have Sarita.
Seems like me and her
ain't gettin' along real well together.
But when it comes to invitin' me
back across that river...
I wasn't planning on inviting you, Cash.
That's not part of it.
I always knew you had a lot of balls, Jack,
but I didn't think you was crazy.
I don't give a damn about
your private army here, Cash.
This is between you and me.
I'm callin' you out.
It's personal.
You ain't leavin' me no alternative
but to settle our differences.
Ain't that right, amigo?
No room to maneuver.
Once I see that Sarita's okay,
we'll settle up.
Why, sure, that's only fair.
What the hell?
You think I want you worried about her when
you ought to be concentrating on killin' me?
But I think
we better have your gun...
or else you don't get to see
the love of your life.
See, I wouldn't want you hooking up with her
with a gun in your hand.
Hell, you'd start acting real heroic,
blazin' away at all these terrible boys...
I got working for me.
Shit! You'd turn it into the Alamo, Jack.
Old Cash wouldn't want that.
I always thought it was a bad habit,
givin' up your gun.
All right. Forget Sarita.
I'll go get my popper,
and we'll settle up right here and now.
You take real good care of that.
Don't worry, you'll get it back in time
for our little finish-up.
You know me,
I keep my promises.
Aw, hell, I always knew that, Cash.
The problem with you is gettin' one out of you.
Oh, Jack, boy, you've no idea
how good it is to see you!
These people here, I'm telling you, they can't
follow old Cash in a verbal sphere at all.
When I'm flyin', son, it is solo.
You know that feelin'
when you're talkin' along...
and you pause for a minute,
maybe freshen your bourbon...
do up your fly or something,
you look around real careful...
and you know in your heart
it's all just wasted.
Ain't nobody understands
where you're at.
All your private jokes and subtle conversation
is just sailin' right past 'em.
You know me, Cash.
I keep the conversation simple.
The hell you do, Jack.
Ah, I miss you, boy.
It's too bad you turned out to be
such a shit heel and wouldn't do business.
We'd have done great
by each other.
Come on in.
We'll rustle up Sarita...
and then we'll have us
our little fun, I promise.
This is pretty damn nice,
ain't it?
Two amigos drinkin'
just like old times.
What I can't figure out is,
how come we can't be friends no more, Jack?
Boy, I'm serious now. I am.
Well, hell, Cash,
we grew up best friends.
I left.
I went out where the dogs bark:
Dallas, Houston, Chicago, New York.
It didn't work.
The only thing that ever scared
the hell out of me, Cash, was myself.
So I come home and I put the badge on,
and things were right.
When I got home,
I looked around for my old friend.
He wasn't there.
He'd gone.
He'd gone, Cash.
He'd gone God damn bad.
No, you went bad on me.
Lost your sense of humor.
Went and got yourself
outfitted government issue.
And we all got us flaws in our character,
but that sure as hell beats mine.
You almost had it,
Cash, but you turned.
I turned
when I saw the light, boy!
Came shinin' down on me
like a bolt of lightnin'.
Made me see how to do it,
how to get everything I wanted, get it all!
Tell me about this light, Cash.
Does it feel right or does it feel wrong?
Hell. There ain't no right or wrong,
there's only choices...
and everybody's got to make their own,
God damn it. That's God-given.
Who the fuck are you
or anybody to take that away?
I'm just a poor boy that rose up.
Nobody ever gave me nothing!
And ain't nobody
gonna take away what I got!
That's about what I figured.
Hey, Jesus, come here.
Yo, patron.
c'Que hay de nuevo?
Well, everything's fine.
It's just fine.
Except for one little thing,
and this will fix it:
I liked him too.
Honest to Christ, I really did like old Jesus
till yesterday's account come up short.
It ain't so much
the damn money...
it's a bad example and the fact
that I trusted the man!
Monday, haul this son of a bitch
out of here.
Ain't nice for a lady
to see all this mess.
It's a damn nice country here.
I like it.
A man can get away with anything
as long as he just keeps payin' his friends.
What they need down here
is a good, old-fashioned revolution.
You know that, Jack?
Get some music goin'!
What the hell is going on here?
Get some music going
or I'll shoot the damn band!
And I want it sweet,
God damn it!
Hey, Miguel,
bring us some champagne!
Don't worry, Jack.
I just need a little more conversation...
and then you'll get your gun.
Where are you going?
- To get me a Tequila.
- I got people to get you a drink, Jack.
I like gettin' things
for myself, Cash.
Look.
Move your head one inch
and I'll blow your brains out.
- éComprende?
- iSi! Okay.
iNo me matas!
Por favor, no me matas.
- Stay on the bed. You got that?
- Si.
Just stay on the bed.
- What are you doin' in here, Buck?
- Been a change in the orders there, Ranger.
Everything's been moved up
15 minutes...
and we got orders
to shoot your ass on sight.
But that don't sit well with me.
Yeah, it's true, I go to lunch
with the governor of this state.
Go to Mexico City,
all them big charity balls.
Christ almighty, ain't nobody like old Cash
for feeding niggers and peons...
and saving whales and crap.
But I ain't got nobody
to talk to, honey.
Nobody from home.
When the shooting starts,
keep your god damn head down.
Go for yourself, Ranger.
Remember that song
your mama taught you?
The one you always said
was your favorite?
Sing it for me, honey.
Come on. Soft on my shoulder
like you used to. Just one more time.
Sing it for me real sweet.
It might put me in a better mood.
Might make me
not want to kill Jack no more.
Come on.
Merv! Slow down.
- Major, what are you doin' here?
- It's a big raid.
The Federales and the D.E.A. struck a deal.
We've got no more protection.
It's all tied in with that bank robbery,
isn't it?
They're gonna target the records.
Where do we keep them?
They're in my office.
Let's go.
Come on.
I'm gonna give you another chance,
honey.
It's me you want to be with.
I know that 'cause I was the first.
I'll always be the first.
Let's go to Cancun...
get us a little bungalow,
swim in that emerald sea...
find our way back
to where we once was.
You're crazy.
You've gone crazy, Cash.
You've gone crazy.
Is that everything?
All my dealings with Cash?
- That's all of it.
- Give it here. I'm gonna take it with me.
I can't do that. It's the only copy.
This belongs to Cash.
Merv, he's my partner. I want to protect him.
I want to protect me.
I can't do it,
not without his permission.
- And Cash, he'd get real pissed.
- Merv, it's okay, honest.
Friend of yours?
This is it, ain't it?
Well, it's a good day for a killin'.
I'm gonna give you a real good chance, Jack,
just 'cause we used to be amigos.
Back to back, count off 10 paces,
then we both start blazin' away.
Blast each other into the land of glory.
May the best man win...
and keep Sarita.
It's all right, honey.
You've come this far with two old friends.
You might as well see them finish it up.
We're just playin' out the string.
Lupo, Ia pistola.
- Aqui estas, jefe.
- Here. Hold the Tequila.
Come on, Cash.
Show us some tit if you want to be useful.
Give us some motivation.
You ready?
Everybody back off!
This is between him and me!
Atras, cabrones!
One...
- two...
- Cash, no!
Ah, shit.
Look, honey, if you're gonna cry,
it just fucks it all up.
It lowers the whole tone.
I mean, this ain't just dog shit we're doing here.
These are two men you love
layin' it on the line.
- A little more leg.
- Cash, get over here!
Sex is eternal.
That's a good girl.
No change in old Sarita.
You tear off a piece there, you always get meat.
You bastard! iCabron, puto!
Now we're all cookin'.
Everybody ready?
You know, Larry,
there's a lot of money at stake here.
Even split.
You and I, we just walk away.
You son of a bitch.
Never was a mission, was there?
- How much you in for?
- $10 million.
Government never knew anything about this.
You cut the orders yourself...
set us up to die,
and you walk away, disappear.
I've served our country
for 20 years...
done every dirty job
ever asked of me.
I've been places and I've done things
I just don't think people should have to do.
There are no heroes, Larry.
You and me, we're just numbers
on a bureaucratic desk.
Let's do it.
Lupo, you count.
Anytime.
Listo.
- Uno...
- Uno...
- dos...
- dos...
- tres...
- tres...
Stupid asshole. When are you going to
wake up and take a look around you?
They don't care!
A couple more missions,
you'll be just like me.
- What are you gonna do, Sergeant?
- nueve... diez!
You son of a bitch.
- It's me, Charlie!
- McRose!
What the fuck's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on,
we've been fucked over by the Major.
Hackett and Bailey are all working together.
We're all supposed to die, Charlie.
But first we hunt the Major.
You see him, kill him like an animal.
Come on!
Get down!
Come on!
Hackett!
You ready?
God damn right, I'm ready.
Jesus H. Christ Almighty.
You think I got all day to fuck around here?
It's after 4:00!
We got to do things right, Jack.
Fair is fair.
Why don't you have our
old girlfriend there count to 3...
and then you and me
will start having fun.
Sarita...
COUFlt.
I said count!
You're both crazy.
Then, amigo,
I guess you and me got to do it.
You get to it,
you can have anything you want.
Including pussy and beer,
all right, Jack?
Give it up, Cash.
I'm tellin' you, give it up.
I can't. Don't you understand?
I can't!
God damn it, Cash. Give it up.
I'll take you home.
Now, just give it up!
I told you before, amigo,
I'm in too deep.
Tell them we can stop right here
