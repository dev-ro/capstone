Good or bad I've had the
habit of writing everything.
Today after 8 years,
I felt like writing again...
Slowly things are
beginning to get better.
Especially Mini...
Hopefully next Week, I will
he able to take Mini to America.

me that I am wasting my money.
There is no guarantee that Mini
will walk again after the operation.
But... What is life without hope?
Today I gave the muse a day off..

Whole Sunday messing about.

Why? You get a police case everyday?
No, No.. I had gone to the police
station but did not see you there.
I just got transferred last week.
Oh! There . .
What is her condition?
That is the problem.
She seems to have gone into a coma.
Coma?
Yes.
It is an acute case of TBI..
Traumatic Brain Injury..
But I don't think it's permanent.
I am expecting her to recover
in the next five to six days...
But inspector. .
I have a different problem.
Her treatment is very expensive..
Who will bear her medical expenses?
At most I can keep her for two days,
beyond that it'll be very difficult.
It's ok Doctor.
I am sure she has someone.
Doctor, can you remove
this mask for a second?
I need to see her face.
Open it.
Durga?!
No no.. Bidya.
Vidya?
Yes. She is not Durga.
She is Bidya, Bidya Sinha.
Vidya Sinha?
How do you know?
Put it hack.
See.. this was with her.
When she was brought in.
Vidya Sinha.
You know her?
No.
Come with me..
Suddenly she came in front.
Happened in this junction..

Hey police, hands up!
Hands up!

You know her?
One second..
This is our Bidya..
I came down and saw no one is here..
I only locked up the house.
You locked up?
Yes. I have a spate key,
in case Mini needs any help.
Who's Mini?
Her daughter.
She has a daughter?!
Yes.
How old is she?
14 ,15 I don't know..
But the poor child is paralyzed.
Where is she now?
Not very sure.
Bidya also was asking where is Mini?
You said Mini is paralyzed?
Yes.
Below the waist.
Her wheelchair is here..
How can she go anywhere?
I don't know.
Maybe the nurse knows.
You have the nurse's number?
It's on that board.
Are you really in a coma or are
you trying to escape from me?
But how will you escape death Durga?
You are not answering...
I'll have to check myself.
Sorry I don't have the
time to clean this.
Okay then.
I won't kill Mini till you regain...
Who are you?
This is not visiting time.
Strange . .
So Vidya asked you not to come today?
Yes.
Ok.
Uncle. .
Uncle. .
You go up and rest.
Rashmi. .
Have you forgotten?
- What?
- You have a wife, a daughter...
I'll have to die to forget that.
Tsk Tsk.
What rubbish you speak!
Why?
You love me that much?
Nope.
Please talk to your daughter.
She is driving me crazy.
Daddy, I want a dog..
That is you mothers department
please ask her.
I asked. She said either she will
stay in the house or the dog.
Good.
This is good news.
Then maybe We should
get a dog immediately..
Why?
You found another wife?
Joking yaar!
When you coming home?
Have you seen the time?
Simran is also waiting for you..
You said 9 p.m..
It's midnight now!
Is this any time to come home?
Come hack quickly.
Have you had dinner?
Have you eaten anything?
Rashmi. Rashmi hold on.
I am coming.. Give me a minute..
Do you want to tell me something?
What? Why?
You look like it.
Why?
You Want to say something?
Yes.
Speak.
Can we go back to Kolkata?
What?
We just shifted a week hack!
It's so boring here!
Everyone goes to sleep by 9 p.m.
It's like this only in small towns.
What?
Everyone goes to sleep at nine.
Then why are we awake?
What happened?
She is not Durga.. Bidya.
- Who's Mini?
- Her daughter.
Something really
distubed me a lot today.
But I don't know whether
I heard it correctly..
Or was it a voice
from my own childhood.
It began as a routine
day at school...
Same old school work.
Fees, Syllabus etc etc..
But the person I wanted to
turn up didn't seem likely today.
Then maybe I spoke too soon..
As usual Mini Dewan was marched
into the Principal's office.
My only respite in
an otherwise boring day.
It happened at least once every week.
Stay here .
Mini Dewan! Come.
Sit.
But Mini never looked at me.
She just sits quietly
playing with her paper toys.
I tried many times to be her friend.
To talk to her.
But all my attempts ï¬‚opped.
It was impossible to he
friends with Mini Dewan.
Today Mrs. Burnett was
a little mole angry than usual.
Mrs. ... Oh.
She is not there?
No.
Durga! I just don't understand what
to do with this gill!
First she didn't
use to pay attention..
Now she has started falling
asleep during my class..
You keep on sitting here!
Nonsense.
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.
And then the day changed..
Mini smiled at me fol the first time.
Diksha...
Rosni...
Today her ca: was late..
So I gave it another shot.
Hello...
Your cat is late today.
You fell asleep in class today?
Your cat's hem..
Do you know my name?
My name is Durga.
Even I used go fall
asleep in my class.
Especially in Maths.
Is Mrs. Burnett very boring?
Must he. She looks it.
No.
Good grief.
You can speak?
Mrs.Burnett is not boring.
No? Then Maths is boring?
Maths is not boring.
Mrs. Burnett is not boring.
Then Why did you fall asleep in class?
Because they don't
let me sleep in the night.
I didn't understand what Mini said.
But before I could ask, the ca: left.
Because they don't
let me sleep in the night.
I don't know Why I buy fruits
everyday.. I don't like fruits..
But I need to change..
The doctor said I must
eat fruits for my skin to improve..
And I want to look better.
But not fol myself. fol Arum.
Durga.
I desperately wanted
to give life a second chance..
I met Arun in kalimpong last year.
I think he likes me.
Even though I am not sure
if I can give him what he wants.
Are you alright?
Yes.
Sure? You seemed lost.
No. I was just quiet.
Really?
Really... Why?
Because We just Walked
past your house..
Durga..
Would you like to come
out for diner tonight?
I wanted to say YES but.
Arun.. today..
Not a problem.
No need to rush.
Whenever you're comfortable...
The restaurant isn't going anywhere..
- It can't also..
- What?
Restaurant.
Ah yes.
But I can go..
Bye!
Bye.
I was angry with myself
fol saying no to Arun..
But I could not get What
Mini said out of my head.
Because they don't
let me sleep in the night.
Something really
distubed me a lot today.
But I don't know whether
I heard it correctly..
OI was it a voice
from my own childhood..
Wake up!
Are you reading a book?
No. It's a diary.
Whose diary?
Looks like a school diary.
It's evidence. From that hit and run...
I didn't even know..
What?
That you can read.
Ha Ha Ha..
Ramsingh come.
Call this nurse.
Ask her to come in..
And also... where do you
record all case related materials?
What, sir?
Case related materials, evidence?
Like this. From the accident case...
Does this station have
a book for recording?
No sir. Nothing happens
here in Chandan Nagar.
Nothing happens?
It's happening now?
Yes.
Go buy one.
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.
Over the next few days,
I tried talking to
I never got a chance..
Ma' am.
3 one's are 3...3 two's are 6...
I didn't know who to talk to..
And I know from my own past...
...that there is no point in talking
to anyone without proof..
I needed to get close to
That's the only Way
she would talk to me.
I needed a plan.
That day after school,
I looked through Mini's records.
I found Mini was Weak
in Maths and English.
I had completely forgotten
about Arun that week...
So has she vanished?
Guard? It's okay..
Didn't I tell you?
Hi.
Sorry. I did not
hear from you all week.
I , got worried..
So I...came here.
Yes.
I Wasn't used to

I was scared.
I always wanted to
hide from everyone
I Wanted to he left alone
I don't Want anyone to touch me.
I'm so Sorry..
You okay?
I need some water.
But I need to get used to life..
If I have to start a new life..
I have to forget my childhood.
I Want to he normal.
I want Arun to like me..
I don't want Arun
to hate me like Inder.

All relatives are like that.
They run away.
But inspector I can't keep

whatever I could to find out..
Who was not letting her sleep?

Yes. Inside.
I am Mini's grandmother.
Hello.

English and
Mathematics were pool..
And the school wanted to
help her with extra tuitions.

And when someone tried to stop her,
she murdered that person.
She has been spotted in Chandan Nagar.

working with them to find this woman.
Rubbish sir.
She can't be a murderer.
How do you know?
You know her?
Sir.. look at her face? Look
You think she can kill someone?
My gut feel says that this
gill is not a murderer.
Inder you were all set to get
a promotion to Lalbazar, right?
You messed up your last
case with your gut feeling.
And instead of a
promotion to Lalbazar.
You got demoted to
Chandan Nagar.
So if I were you..
I would rely a little
less on my gut feeling.
Sorry sir.
Sir, got a new book.
We can record evidence here.

Vidya Sinha, okay.
Hello.
Durga.. Your student.
From now she is you: responsibility..
And .
You must study properly,
School feels you
are very behind in class.
No... No.. Nothing like that.
Let me finish, please.
So Mini you must study properly.
Ma'am you need anything?
What would you like to have?
Ahhh...
She doesn't Want anything.
I could see Mini was
uneasy seeing me in the house.
I needed something
to make her comfortable.
Sit down Mini..
And I got it.
Ma'am I would need you to leave.
It would be better if
I could teach Mini alone..
You Want me to leave?
No.. Not like that.
You know What I mean!
I couldn't believe
that I winked at the lady.
Neither could she..
I was too much in a hurry.
Mini, remember What
you told me that day?
Who doesn't let you
sleep in the night?
Mini!
Why are you outside?
Mini I asked you a question?
Why have you left the room?
I asked her to get me some water.
Okay. In future just ring
the bell next to the table.
- The servant will come.
- Ok.
Come.
How could I forget, that unless
she wanted to talk herself.
I could not force her to talk.
What do you Want to do?
I had to first become her friend.
Her confidante.
A friend who she
can trust and talk to.
A friend who I never had.
Do you sell water colors?
I had read somewhere that painting
is a good way to bond with children...
Let's paint.
Take.
Can I use my fingers?
But they will get dirty. Use a brush.
I forgot Mini needs
to make her own choices.
Okay, use your fingers.
Mini.
Durga let me show you RAJNIGANDHA.
Rajnigandha?
Yep.
Vidya Sinha's Rajnigandha.
Who's Vidya Sinha?
I love Vidya Sinha.
What's this?
Draw.
Come..
Where you taking me?
MY Playroom;.
My god!
You have so many toys?
I spent 9 months with
But I still wasn't any closer
to the answer I was looking fol..
What happens to you?
Sorry..
No...No , it's all right.
Madam.. I have to go..
What's this?
Seems as if someone is
drawing on a repeat loop.
Arun made me realise
that Mini was not thawing.
She was repeating.
As if something is happening to her on
a repeat loop. Over and over again.
These zeroes were like secrets
coming out from inside her.
And that secret was hidden
somewhere inside this house
I had to find it.
I needed evidence.
Everything was normal.
I found nothing.
But I didn't know
what I was looking fol..
All I knew was that What happened to
me as a child should not happen to Mini
This world doesn't
need another Durga.
Yes?
Sorry.. I was looking for the toilet.
But this is my study..
Not that bad as a toilet. Is it?
No. No. Its nothing like a toilet.
In fact very neat and clean.
You are here
to tutor Mini right?
Yes.
There is a toilet downstairs
also, near the living room.
Oh. Okay.
Uhhh.. Sorry.
It looked so beautiful.
Like Japanese origami.
You like origami?
- Yes.
- Very good!
Let me make something fol you..
- No No.. Let me not brother you..
- Please. Please.
I insist.
You are a guest in our house.
For you.

The food is not good?
Not good but very good
You approve of the cook?
I would hire this cook any day.
Good. There's an offer on..
What?
You can have this cook fol
life at a throwaway price..
Plus he will clean
the dishes fol flee.
Meaning?
I got a promotion.
I am now the international
manager of my publication.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
But I have to relocate to London..
Oh...
Let me finish.
Durga..
I would he honored if you married
me and come to London.
- OIL. Arum.
- No rush.
Take your time
I told Arun that I'd give him an
answer before he leaves.
As much as I was scared
of a marriage again...
Sit down !
...I really wanted to be with Arun.
Durga! What to do with this child?
Again she fell asleep in my class.
What's this?
Mini how did you hurt yourself?
Huh?
Mini didn't say a wold.
But I couldn't take it any mole.
- Where is Mini?
- Upstairs.
And running.. running..
running...running...he wins..
Mini?
I can't come this Saturday.
So I have to teach Mini today.
Okay. Come.. Let's change.
Then-is no one I.n the house.
So I was just helping Mini to change.
I'll help her.
Ok. Mini time to study.
We will play later.
Come Mini!
Minn...
Her clothes .
I was sure he knew that I knew.
I had to move fast.
I am very angry ..may--
Why?
This man who I know..
he touched me here.
I don't like anybody touching
me here or here. Makes me very angry.
And it really hurts.
Especially here .
I was very neat to Mini's truth..
I needed to move very carefully.
He keeps touching me..
I don't know how to stop them.
Me too.
Yeah. I don't like it at all.
Yeah.
One of my friends touched me..
Who touched you Mini?
Mobil uncle..
- He keeps.
- Mini!
Yes.
Mini, you haven't drank your milk..
- Come.. quickly drink your
- Yes, uncle.
So you don't like anyone
touching you here and there?
She is an six year old child.
Your own niece.
But she likes it when
I touch her here and there.
What is you: problem?
Anything that I can fix?
But you are grown up now!
I will report you.
Do it.
Do it.
And What do you think
will happen to Mini if you did?
What will happen to you?
What if suddenly there are people
who want to touch you here and there?
Mrs. Dewan..
I told her what her
son was doing with
What?
First she couldn't believe it..
Then she understood.
I did not know whether I was
feeling a sense of victory or relief.
But. Mini was finally safe.
My happiness was short-lived.
I don't understand?
Durga We are letting you go.
You have brought shame to this school.
You have impersonated a teacher and
stolen things from the Dewan family.
Be glad that the family is not pressing
any police charges against you.
Ma'am Mini is being
abused by her uncle.
- What?
- Even her grandmother knows this.
I had a suspicion and that's
why I did all this to find out..
And because I found out,
they are not going to the police.
Dewans? Are you blind?
Durga I know this family personally!
Mobil loves Mini like his daughter.
Why would a family
abuse their own child?
Unfortunately you
are the one Who's blind.
It was useless talking to Mr.Mason.
I did what I should've done long ago.
Keep the file.
- Yes?
- I want to report a child abuse.
Him.
- Mr.Mohit Dewan?
- Yes?
- Come this side!
- Why?
Come this side!
What's going on?
Where is Mini?
Let him go.
Sorry Mr. Dewan!
What? Why are you letting him go?
Mini hasn't said anything
which points to
...not have we found anything in the
house which can incriminate anyone.
She is a liar.

Durga.
I never gave Arun an answer.
That night Arun Went away to London.
I had to choose between Arun and
I chose
Are you still reading?
Yes .. Almost done...
I was really missing Arun.
Normally he would meet me here.
Durga!
Do you have any idea,
how much my mother loves me?
Why did you go to the police, Durga?
Because you are a pervert
and you need to be in jail.
How did you know?
I am curious. Are you an expert?
OI out of experience?
I would say its experience...
...especially if you don't like
being touched here and there.
So tell me.. When you grew up..
Did it affect you?
Are you married?
Can you be normal with you: partner?
They say these things spoil
your sex life, you get seated of sex?
Are you also scared?
For no reason you ended
Mimi's life Durga..
And now..
I hope you can live with that.
There was something
in Mohit's voice...
...which made me feel
very scared for Mini.
I needed to see her.
I needed to know she is safe.
There was no one in the house.
Mini?
I couldn't find Mini.
Mini...
Mini...
Mini...
Mini...
Mini...
Mini...
Mini...
What are you doing out there?
Come here.
Come inside.
Mini..
Mini...
Mini what are you doing here?
It's very scary here.
Let's go.
Its all my fault.
What?
Grandma told me its all my fault.
It would be
better if I wasn't there.
She did not mean it.
You are a very good girl ok?
I am a had gill.
Because of me mummy and daddy died..
Because of me Mobil
uncle is feeling sad..
It's all my fault.
It's not your fault.
Everything is going to he okay..
I promise.
Come.. Let's go inside.
I have to make it right.
Make What right?
You don't have to do anything..
Come inside.
- Come.
- It's all my fault.
- It's not you: fault.
- Grandma said it's all my fault.
You don't have to do anything.
Go inside.
MINI!!
Where are you going
at this time of the night?
Vidya Sinha.
Durga.. I don't know
if you can heat me..
What?
Police work. Go to sleep
or I will put you in jail..
Durga.. This is Inder.
I am so sorry Durga
but you never told me.
Today I realized after
reading you: diary.
Durga when we got married
we were too young..
..and we didn't understand much.
I didn't know you had so
much pain and hurt inside you..
I thought you just didn't like me.
DOCTOR! DOCTOR!
I am telling you doctor.
Her finger moved..
Where I am saying it didn't?
It may have.. But
sometimes it happens.
Doesn't mean anything.
It's purely a reï¬‚ex action.
But how?
Watch.
Get me a needle.
See? Did anything move?
Put some cotton.
And What do you think
will happen to Mini?
For no reason you ended
Mimi's life Durga.
It's all my fault.
MINI!!
Durga Rani Singh?
Yes.
May We come in?
Why is she here?
Durga.. You have filed some serious
accusations against my family...
I Wanted to explain to you..
You don't have to explain anything
to me. It's all with the police.
I think it's best we
take this matter inside..
to discuss it
out here in the open.
Come let's go inside.
Durga.. Mini is a child..
She says anything she Wants.
That doesn't mean it's all true.
Mini never got the
love of her parents. .
And that's Why she has been a little
mentally unstable since childhood.
Mini is not mentally unstable,
Mrs. Dewan!
It's you and your son
Who's mentally unstable.
Who did all those..
Mobil hasn't done anything to
He has. Mini told me herself
You can't rely on her words!
Tomorrow if she says that.
...you pushed her off the
roof and should I believe that?
So that's your solution?
Try and prove that Mini
is mad so nobody believes her?
Come on, Durga..
I have known Mini since birth.
And that's Why you allowed Mohit..
to abuse your own granddaughter
whom you know since birth?
Mohit loves Mini
like his own daughter.
That is not love, Mrs.
Dewan. That is abuse.
Then Why didn't Mini
say anything till now?
Surely she would know the
difference between love and abuse..
Tell me, Mrs. Dewan.
How does an six year old know the
difference between love and abuse?
How does she know...
that when someone touches her private
parts, that is not love hut abuse.
How does that six year old know
that there are toys..
but her uncle's private parts is not
a toy to play with?
How does she know that when her uncle
doesn't let her sleep at night...
It's not a game. It's abuse.
Tell me Mrs. Dewan?
How does an six year old know
the difference between love and abuse?
Durga.. this is going somewhere else..
So Withdraw the case
and let's settle this.
What do you Want?
All I want is to see you
and you: son in jail!
If Mini does not know the
difference between love and abuse...
it's because of YOU.
Durga have you said
this to anyone else?
No one. Why?
Good.
You go to the hospital
and take care of.
I will take care of this one.
Please don't hurt her..
She is only a child..
You should have minded
your own business.
Mrs. Dewan! Mrs. Dewan!!!
Hey? Why in such a hurry to die?
Sorry Durga. I didn't
have the time to sterilize this.
You are only making
it difficult for yourself.
It's up to you whether you
want a painful or a painless death.
It's very simple..
A lonely gill, unmarried
lost her job..
Slashes her wrist in depression.
What's that?
Nothing. This is going
to help you to sleep.
But I don't Want to sleep.
I Want to go home.
Didn't uncle and I give you
so many toys and dresses?
So that you don't tell
anyone outside?
Did We not give you?
But you didn't do
What I told you to do..
I am sorry.
I will not do it again.
I Want to go home.
Sister, which room is Mini Dewan in?
- Mini Dewan..cabin number 29.
- 29.
L.1...
13..
I don't Want to sleep.
I am scared.
Well, it's all your fault,
Mini.
It's not her fault, It's not
her fault. Say it's not her fault..
It's YOUR fault.
She is only a six year old child..
Say it's not her fault.
Mildâ€
Come on, let's get
you out of here...
Grandma?
She's gone to sleep.
Do I have to sleep also?
No no. As long as I am alive
nothing will happen to you.
Promise .
You have grown..
I missed you.
Everyone loves spelling?
- Yeah.
- And you're not scared of aunty?
- No..

She kidnapped Mini, and maybe...
...responsible fol the
death of Mimi's grandmother.

that she is your ex-wife?
No, no one.

Even I didn't remember
Durga till I saw her again..
Do you believe her story?
I don't know...
But Why would someone
write lies in their diary?
And the other kidnapping
and murder story?
My gut feeling says
that Durga is not like that.

She was my wife.
Rashmi? Why are you crying?

Sir, I think she
has left fol Kolkata.
I have the same feeling.
You: men came all the
way from Chandan Nagar.
To tell us that they
found this woman...
And then lost her?
Looks like it.
Sir if I'm not mistaken..
..this Chandan Nagar is just
about the size of a football ground.
How can she escape from there?
How?
Excuse me, Ma'am..
What are you doing here?
I am looking fol the exit.
Come with me, Ma'am.
I'll show you where it is.
I don't understand why this woman
would come to Kolkata from Kalimpong?
If she wanted to escape, she would
have run fa: away!
Why come to a place so close?
