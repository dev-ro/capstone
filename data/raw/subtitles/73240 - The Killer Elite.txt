THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES...
WITHIN THE CONFINES
OF THE UNITED STATES.
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM FRIDAY,
AFTER HE'S GONE,
IS NO LONGER OUR CONCERN.
[ Collis ]
WHO TRIED TO KILL HIM
THIS TIME ?
[ O'Leary ]
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
ABOUT THAT YET.
EXCEPT IT'S SOMETHING
OFF THE FAR EAST CIRCUIT.
WE'VE HAD WORD
THAT NEGATO TOKU
MAY BE IN THE COUNTRY.
[ Weyburn ]  WHO IS HE ?
[ Collis ]  THE GODFATHER
OF ALL THE NINJA ASSASSINS.
BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN
OUTSIDE OF JAPAN,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.
[ O'Leary ]
WELL, IF HE IS HERE,
IT'S EITHER FOR COMPELLING
PERSONAL REASONS...
OR HE'S BEEN PAID
A LOT OF YEN.
THE POINT IS, WE DO KNOW
THAT YUEN CHUNG IS HERE.
- WE'VE GOT TO KEEP HIM ALIVE
  UNTIL HE CONNECTS WITH A SHIP.
- [ Yelling ]
THE POSITION
OF OUR AGENCY IS FOR ONCE
MANIFESTLY CLEAR.
WE DON'T WISH TO
AND WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED
ANY FURTHER THAN WE ALREADY ARE.
THEN WHY SHOULD WE ?
WE DON'T WANT
YUEN CHUNG KILLED
IN THE UNITED STATES.
RIGHT NOW
WE CAN'T AFFORD
THE PUBLICITY.
[ Yelling ]
[ Yelling Continues ]
[ Weyburn ]
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
GIVEN US A REASON...
WHY WE SHOULD TAKE THIS ON.
ALL RIGHT, CLINCHER.
WE'VE HAD WORD...
THAT AFTER THE CHOP SUEY
AT THE AIRPORT THIS MORNING,
THE JAPANESE ASSASSIN GROUP
HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED BY
A BACKUP TEAM,
AN AMERICAN EXPERT.
GEORGE HANSEN.
WE JUST TOOK THE JOB.

HEY, DUDE, THANK YOU.
[ Laughing ]
[ Man Yelling ]
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
OH, THANK YOU.
[ Collis ]
AT CLOSE RANGE.
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOUR OPPONENT
IS 20 FEET AWAY...
HOLDING DOWN ON YOU
WITH A 12-GAUGE PUMP GUN ?
WELL, I, UH--
I GUESS I'D JUST
SHOOT HIM WITH MINE.
- WHERE WOULD YOU GET IT ?
- PROBABLY THE SAME PLACE
  YOU GOT YOURS, YOU JACKASS.
WE NEED TO TALK.
UH, DONNIE,
I'LL-- I'LL CALL

ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS
KEEP HIM ALIVE UNTIL WE CAN
GET HIM OUT ON A SHIP.
WHEN DO I START ?
NOW.
FIRST YOU'LL NEED
A DRIVER AND A BACKUP.
WHAT FOR ?
ME AND MY CANE.
YOU'RE UP AGAINST A TEAM
OF INTERNATIONAL ASSASSINS.
YOU NEED ALL THE FIREPOWER

ON TOP OF THAT,
THE ENTIRE SAN FRANCISCO
POLICE DEPARTMENT...
IS LOOKING FOR YOUR MAN.
HE LEFT SOME DEBRIS

WELL, I GOT SOMETHING,
UH, A LITTLE BETTER
THAN CLAY PIGEONS FOR YOU.
I HEARD
THEY RETIRED YOU.
NO, NOT YET.
I DON'T THINK
YOUR COMPANY'D HIRE ME.
THEY GOT ME TAPPED AS A PSYCHO.

STEEL PLATE WRAPAROUND.
REINFORCED BUMPERS.

SOME UNION GUY
PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.
BULLETPROOF GLASS.
AND THEN THEY SHOT HIM
IN BED.
I GOT IT FROM HIS WIDOW.
WELL, I, UH, THOUGHT
YOU KISSED THE BUSINESS OFF.
WHY'D YOU BUY
A BUGGY LIKE THIS ?
YOU KNOW, UH, MAYBE
I APPRECIATE A GOOD MACHINE.
I USED TO THINK

WHO'S THE CLOWN
BEHIND THE TOOL RACK ?
YOU KNOW THIS FELLA ?
OH, THAT'S MILLER.
HE'S WITH US.
HE'S A REAR GUNNER.
JOSEPHINE WAS ROBBED
A COUPLE OF TIMES
LAST MONTH.
I'M SORRY.
NICE PLACE LIKE THIS ?

I'M SORRY, JOSEPHINE.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,
DON'T YOU ?
OKAY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER

CAP, THIS IS GONNA MAKE
FOR TOO MUCH CLUTTER.
EXACTLY MY FEELING.
I TOLD MR. COLLIS
THAT I STRONGLY OBJECT
TO HIS BRINGING YOU INTO THIS.
MY GROUP, THE NINJA,
WORK MUCH MORE QUIETLY.
THEY'RE CLOWNS.
THAT THING THEY TRIED
AT THE AIRPORT THIS MORNING
WAS A THREE-RING FLOP.
- YOUR PEOPLE MAY BE
  BLACK BELTS OR WHATEVER,
- [ Scattered Applause ]
BUT IF THEY GET IN MY WAY,
THEY'LL END UP BLACK AND BLUE
OR D.O.A.; THAT'S A PROMISE.
IT'S A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
TO ME WHO ELIMINATES YUEN CHUNG.
HOWEVER, MR. COLLIS,
SIMPLY AS A MATTER
OF RACIAL PRIDE,
IF MY GROUP, THE NINJA,
HANDLE THIS MATTER...
AND BECOME
PERSONALLY INVOLVED,
AND IF YOUR MAN
FAILS,
YOU AND I WILL
HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE
OUR ARRANGEMENT.
THERE IT IS, GEORGE.
THE BOTTOM LINE.
I WON'T LET US DOWN.
AND I DON'T BELIEVE
FOR A SECOND THAT, UH,
YOU'LL LOSE OUT EITHER WAY.
IN FACT, YOU PROBABLY
SENT FOR THIS, THIS GROUP.
THAT'S YOUR STYLE, CAP--

I CAN JUST FEEL IT.
IS THAT WHY YOU MADE 'EM
PUT THE LIGHTS ON UPSTAIRS ?
HE REALLY BLEW YOU APART,
DIDN'T HE ?
WHATEVER HE DOES
DICTATES THE WAY YOU GO.
YOU'RE GETTIN' TO BE
HIS PRISONER, MIKE.
UP HERE.
YOU'RE WRONG, MAC.
I NEVER HAD IT MORE TOGETHER
IN MY LIFE.
YOU KNOW WHAT
MAKES ME LAUGH ?
SINCE 5:00 THIS AFTERNOON,
YOU BEEN GETTIN' SHOT AT,
STABBED AT, YELLED AT.
YOU BROKE ENOUGH LOCAL
ORDINANCES TO PUT YOURSELF
ON ICE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
AND HOW MANY DEAD PEOPLE
SO FAR ?
JUST THAT ONE DUDE.
OF COURSE, UH,
MILLER GOT HIS LIMIT.
[ Rifle Cocks ]
[ Mac ]
OH, YEAH.
I KNOW THE RATIONALE.
SELF-DEFENSE.
GOD AND COUNTRY.
ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT
IN NATIONAL INTEREST.
WELL,
THIS ONE DOES HAVE
A LITTLE FRINGE BENEFIT.
DAMN IT, MIKE.
YOU'RE SO BUSY DOING THEIR
DIRTY WORK, YOU CAN'T TELL
WHO THE BAD GUYS REALLY ARE.
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW
WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE--
ANYBODY
THAT TRIES TO HURT ME.
THEY'RE ALL TRYIN'
TO HURT YOU, MIKE.
ALL THE GODDAMN
POWER SYSTEMS.
ALL THE WHEELERS
AND DEALERS AT THE TOP
WITH THEIR GIN AND FIZZES.
THEY NEED GUYS LIKE YOU
TO DO THEIR BLOODLETTING...
WHILE THEY'RE
BUSY MAKING SPEECHES
ABOUT FREEDOM AND PROGRESS.
THEY'RE ALL FULL OF BULLSHIT.
THERE'S NOT ONE POWER SYSTEM
THAT REALLY CARES
ABOUT ITS CIVILIANS.
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WILL YOU TAKE A LITTLE AIR ?
SET ONE OF THOSE AUTOMATICS
AT THE BACK DOOR.
NOW CHECK THE BACK.
ALL RIGHT ?
YOU TAKE THE BOAT,
CHECK OUT THE CATCH.
I'LL GO THIS WAY.
[ Knocks On Door ]
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOIN' ?
WHERE YOU GOIN' ?
GOING OUT
TO USE THE NIGHT.
"TO USE THE NIGHT."
ISN'T THAT ADORABLE ?
HEY, LOOK,
I GOT A MANIAC OUT THERE
WITH A .30-06.
HE'S GONNA BLOW YOU APART
IF YOU TAKE TEN STEPS.
HE'LL HAVE
TO SEE ME FIRST.
LOOK, KID.
LOOK, DO ME A FAVOR,
WILL YA ?
GO DO THE TIGER CLAW
AND THE CRANE STANCE AND ALL
THAT OTHER CRAP IN THE CORNER,
BECAUSE OUT THERE
IT'S NO GOOD.
YOU'RE HER FATHER.
TALK TO HER.
- SHE'S BEEN SHOT AT BEFORE.
- WHAT KIND OF WHACKED-OUT
  FAMILY IS THIS ?
WHERE IS SHE ?
HEY.  HEY !
JEROME !
DON'T SHOOT !
IT'S THAT WHACKED-OUT CHICK
IN THE WITCH SUIT !
CAN YOU HEAR ME ?
I HEAR YA.
WELL, GET YOUR FINGER
OFF THE TRIGGER !
OKAY.  OKAY.
WELL, THAT'S, UM--
THAT'S GREAT.
IF HANSEN'S WITHIN A MILE,
HE KNOWS WHERE WE ARE.
YOU PEOPLE DON'T CARE
WHETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE.
OF COURSE WE DO.
IT'S IN THE MANNER
OF LIVING AND OF DYING
ONE FINDS RELEVANCE.
WELL, SO THAT'S HOW
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO YOUR COUNTRY TO DIE.
I MEAN,
WHO'S GONNA KEEP YOU ALIVE
WHEN YOU'RE THERE ?
I DON'T NEED AN ARMY.
I AM NOT REVOLUTIONARY.
NOR DO I WANT POWER.
WE'VE HEARD THAT
BEFORE.
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
I UNDERSTAND IT NOW.
HE WANTS TO GO BACK TO DIE
ON HIS OWN NATIVE SOIL.
IT'S THAT
"SALMON UP THE RIVER" SHIT.
EVERY COUNTRY,
IF IT HOPES TO BECOME
A DEMOCRACY,
NEEDS AT LEAST ONE VOICE
RAISED IN OPPOSITION.
I HAPPEN TO BE SELECTED.
LET JUST ONE OTHER PERSON
HEAR MY VOICE.
THAT IS A BEGINNING.
IT'S ENOUGH.
HA HA.
I'LL GIVE YOU THIS.
ALL THE OTHER SHEEP I'VE DIPPED
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RUNNING AWAY
FROM THEIR COUNTRIES.
YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE I'VE MET
THAT'S JUMPING BACK
INTO THE FRYING PAN.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
TELLING YOU BEFORE.
YOU'RE RISKING YOUR LIFE
KEEPING HIM ALIVE AND
GETTING HIM BACK SOMEPLACE...
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA
FINISH HIM OFF ANYWAY.
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
DRAG YOUR DAUGHTER ALONG ?
SHOULDN'T SHE BE IN A CONVENT ?
FOR THE SAME REASON
YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO
KEEP HER FROM GOING OUTSIDE.
[ Groaning ]
MAC, RUN A CHECK
ON THE BACK AGAIN, WILL YA ?
THEN CHECK ON THE BOAT.
[ Mike ]
I'M VERY GLAD I'M NOT
YOUR INSURANCE BROKER.
BUT YOU ARE.
I AM ?  WELL, YOU'D BETTER
CHECK YOUR GODDAMN POLICY
AND PICK UP A WEAPON.
'CAUSE ALL THAT PHILOSOPHICAL
BULLSHIT'S NOT GONNA GET YOU
ON THAT SHIP TOMORROW.
NOW, PICK UP
A GODDAMN WEAPON !
BULLSHIT.
[ Door Opens, Slams Shut ]
[ Tommie Gasps ]
OH, NO.
MIKE !
I GOT THE GIRL.
[ George ]
TELL HER FATHER
TO COME OUT.
YOU AND MAC AND MILLER
GO OUT INTO THE LIGHT.
FURTHER OUT.
OTHERWISE SHE TAKES THREE
STRAIGHT INTO
HER INSCRUTABLE SMILE.
LET'S GO NOW.
MAC.
DID YOU GO THROUGH
HER PURSE YET ?
NOT YET.
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME.
I THOUGHT,
FOR THE RIGHT PRICE,
YOU ALWAYS HAD THE TIME.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GOT THE RIGHT PRICE.
LIKE ME TO CUT YOU IN ?
DON'T BE STUPID, MIKE.
WHO ARE YOU LOYAL TO ?
YOUR BOSS ?
WE BOTH HAVE THE SAME BOSS.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
 WHAT DO I MEAN ?
- WE BOTH WORK
  FOR THE SAME GUY.
- COLLIS ?
DON'T FEEL BAD.
I GOT THE HIGHEST BUYOUT FIGURE
ANY ONE OF US EVER GOT.
I SET A NEW STANDARD.
LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.
WELL.
WELL, THIS ONE IS BORA BORA
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
THE GOOD LIFE
IN THE SUN.
- [ Tommie Gasps ]
- PUT IT DOWN, MAC.
GO ON.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
KILL ME ?
I LIKE YOU, MIKE.
WE BEEN THERE, MAN.
IF IT HADN'T BEEN ME,
IT WOULD'VE BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE.
SHOOT HIM !
HE HAPPENS TO HAVE
A GUN AT YOUR HEAD.
YOU WOULDN'T SHOOT
AN 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
WOULD YOU ?
YOU BET I WOULD.
 YOU BET I WOULD.
YOU BELIEVE THIS, GEORGE ?
IT'S LOVELY, ISN'T IT ?
THAT'S ALL I GOT TO HEAR NOW
IS A LITTLE CHINESE
SOAP OPERA.
[ Panting ]
SHUT UP.
SHUT UP !
I'VE NOTCHED EVERY ONE
OF THESE LITTLE .38s MYSELF,
YOU KNOW.
WELL,
IT'D BE QUITE A SCENE NOW
IF WE ALL STARTED SHOOTIN',
WOULDN'T IT ?
IT'D BE SOMETHIN' ELSE,
WOULDN'T IT ?
WHERE'S MILLER ?
MILLER ?
[ Mike ]
COME ON DOWN.
[ Whispers ]
SHIT.
I'M COMIN'.
WELL, HURRY UP.
MIKE, I GOT NOTHING AGAINST
THIS GIRL HERE, AND I'M DEAD SET
AGAINST KILLING YOU.
IT'S THE CHINAMAN
I WANT.
IT'S HIS PROBLEM.
IT'S HIS KID HERE.
SO GIVE HIM TO ME.
I'LL SEE
IF I CAN'T HUSTLE COLLIS
INTO BOOSTING MY FEE,
GIVE YOU
A NICE PIECE OF IT.
LOOK, MIKE,
IF YOU DON'T WORK
THIS ONE OUT WITH ME,
WE'RE BOTH SCREWED.
COLLIS HAS
A MIXED BAG OF KILLERS
BACKING ME UP.
FOR ALL I KNOW,
HE SENT THEM OVER HERE
AFTER BOTH OF US.
WELL,
WIN A FEW,
LOSE A FEW.
NOW, STAY RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE.
PUT YOUR PISTOL DOWN.
ALL RIGHT,
PUT YOUR CANE DOWN.
YEP.
I HEAR YOU'VE GOTTEN
PRETTY GOOD WITH IT.
[ Cane Hits Ground ]
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, GEORGE.
SEE YA.
WHERE YOU GOIN',
MIKE ?
WHERE YOU GOIN' ?
[ Moans ]
MIKE !
[ Gunshot ]
[ Screams ]
[ George Wheezing ]
WHEW.
CLOSE, PARTNER.
CLOSE.
OHH !
[ Groaning ]
[ Groans ]
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT,
JEROME.
YEAH.
[ Bell Dinging,
  Coins Jingling ]
[ Telephone Rings ]
YEAH ?
LET'S GO BACK IN
AND GET COMFORTABLE.
[ Weyburn ]  THE OPTIMUM
WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONFESSION
FROM COLLIS HIMSELF.
WITH HANSEN DEAD,
WE DON'T HAVE A WITNESS.
BUT AT LEAST IT'S A STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT.
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NOW.
I'M NOT GONNA FOLLOW
COLLIS' RENDEZVOUS PLAN.
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT
HANSEN BLEW IT AND SEND THE REST
OF THAT PACK DOWN ON US...
BEFORE I CAN
SEND CHUNG OUT TO SEA.
LISTEN CAREFULLY.
TOMORROW MORNING...
GET OVER TO SUISUN BAY
WHERE THE MOTHBALL FLEET
IS ANCHORED.
LINE "G,"
QUEEN VICTORYAND WAIT.
I'LL HAVE TRANSPORTATION
FOR YOU AROUND 12:00 NOON.
[ Mike ]
ALL RIGHT.  12:00.
OH, AND MIKE.
YEAH ?
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'LL GET COLLIS,
AND WHEN I'VE NAILED HIM
HIS JOB IS YOURS--
DISTRICT SUPERVISOR.
HOW DOES THAT SOUND ?
[ Exhales ]
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE,
AN UPPER ?
DOWNER.
MAYBE I OUGHTA
HAVE ONE, HUH ?
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN ?
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR HIM ALL NIGHT.
COME ON.
LET'S GO.  LET'S GO.
[ Chung ]
YOU GUYS, GIVE HIM A HAND
WITH THE STAYSAIL.
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.
SOMETHIN' FUNNY.
SOMETHIN' FUNNY.
WHO IN THE HELL'S PAYING
FOR THIS GRAVEYARD ANYWAY ?
I DON'T LIKE IT, PARTNER.
DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.
NAH, I DON'T
LIKE IT EITHER.
WE'LL GO AROUND,
TIE UP ON THE OTHER SIDE.
HEY, MAC !
YEAH ?
TAKE OVER, WILL YA ?
YEAH, I'LL TAKE
THE WHEEL.
STAND BACK.
WHY DON'T YOU
GO CHECK THAT UZI
AND OTHER STUFF, HUH ?
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THE KID DOWN BELOW
AND STAY THERE.
STAY THERE UNTIL
YOU HEAR FROM ME,
ALL RIGHT ?
[ Mike ]
MAC, CUT IT TO STARBOARD.
I GOT IT, MIKE.
[ Mac ]
READY TO DOCK.
[ Mike ]  IF SOMETHING
DON'T SOUND RIGHT TO YOU,

LET'S GO, MAC.  MAC !
[ Mac ]

I KNEW IT.
[ Mike ]
COLLIS !

LET'S TALK.
[ Mike ]  LET'S TALK.
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, BOYS.
[ Miller ]  YEAH.
PARK IT
OVER HERE, MAC.
RIGHT ON TIME.
[ Chuckles ]
AFTER ALL
WE PUT YOU THROUGH

SPECTACULARLY UNRUFFLED.
YOU KNOW ME, CAP.
AN OLD WARHORSE.
WELL, THE SHIP SHOULD BE HERE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR.
HANSEN TOLD ME, YOU KNOW.
WHY NOT ?
YOU WERE BUDDIES.
EVERYBODY PAYS YOU,
DON'T THEY ?
I MEAN,
OUR SIDE, THEIR SIDE.
SIDES, SIDES.
ALL FULL OF SHIT.
THEY ALL WANT THE SAME THING:
TO BE IN CHARGE.
YOU THINK
YOUR ORIENTAL FRIEND
IS ANY DIFFERENT ?
JUST ANOTHER
AMBITIOUS POLITICIAN.
LISTEN.
SO YOU BLEW MY TOP BOY
RIGHT AWAY.
YOU CAN TAKE HIS PLACE.
RIGHT NOW.
WITH A NI--
OW !  OW !
SLOW.
SLOW.
YEAH.
NICE ROUND 50 GRAND IN IT

AH, HOLD IT.
THAT'S IT.  HE'S GOING
TO THE S.F.P.D.  IT'S OVER.
SOME THINGS

YOU DON'T PUSH AWAY.
MY COUNTRY
GROWS MANY LIKE TOKU.
I'LL SHOOT THE GUY,
MIKE.
NO.  PLEASE DON'T.
IF I DON'T SURVIVE,
I'M NOT THE MAN
THAT'S NEEDED.
I NEVER HEARD
SO MUCH BULLSHIT
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
HOW YOU GONNA SAVE YOUR
PEOPLE STANDING TOE-TO-TOE
WITH THIS MOTHER ?
HUH ?
WE DIDN'T GO THROUGH ALL
OF THIS STUFF TO WATCH
YOU GET KILLED.  GO ON, MAC.
NO, PLEASE.
MANY TIMES, MAN'S DECISIONS
BETRAY THEIR CONFUSION.
ONE MUST DEVELOP
CLEAR ROADS TO FOLLOW.
GIMME.  I'M GONNA
SHOOT HIM ANYWAY.
MIKE.
DON'T.  PLEASE.
WHO CARES ?
[ Spits ]
- WHAT ARE
  THOSE OUTFITS ANYWAY ?
- I DON'T KNOW.
RITUAL GOWNS, MAYBE.
GOOFY-LOOKING THINGS.

LOCKEN !
[ Breathing Heavy ]
THE CUTTER'S ON ITS WAY.

AND PUT
OUR CLIENT ABOARD.
COLLIS IS FINISHED,
THANKS TO YOU.
TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF
THEN COME IN,
AND WE'LL START YOU UP
ON YOUR NEW JOB.
AND CONGRATULATIONS.
I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO SEE MY CLIENTS HOME.
PUT 'EM ON THE CUTTER.
THAT'S OUR
ONLY RESPONSIBILITY.
MIKE, WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA LISTEN TO ME ?
HE USED YOU.  WEYBURN
USED ALL OF US TO CLEAN UP
SOME OFFICE POLITICS.
- HOW MUCH WOULD WE MAKE
  IF WE WENT BACK WITH YOU ?
- NOTHING.
NOTHING ?
THAT MUCH, HUH ?
WELL,
THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT.
WALK AWAY.
COME WITH ME.
BE A CIVILIAN.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAY
WITH THIS SON OF A BITCH,
OH, WEYBURN...
