Oh, really? Sounds delicious
What does?
He knows a good place
that does steak. Where is it?
You know the Honmoku-tei in Ueno?
lt's right next door
It's run by an old coupIe
RealIy? I'd Iike to try it
l usually go to that pork restaurant
behind the Matsuzakaya
You, too, right?
I've been going there
ever since it was just a stall
That was when we were students.
Always hungry, but no money
We'd pool our money, then go there
together. Miwa used to come, too
ReaIly? You were friends with him
when you were that young?
Yeah. We also shared
the same dormitory at school
Did you reaIIy?
Mr Miwa was very kind to me
He was an excellent manager,
always very calm
- This is his seventh memorial
- Time flies
- How many years has it been for you?
- What do you mean?
- Since you lost your wife
- Four, almost five years
Hey, the tea staIk's sticking up
Very auspicious. Maybe something
good's going to happen
lt could mean that your dead wife
is coming back to get you
Oh, stop it! l'm not ready to go yet
- UncIe's rather late
- l wonder what could've happened
Oh, here he comes
Sorry l'm so late
l'm Shuzo Miwa's brother.
Thank you all for coming here today
Being from the countryside,
l got lost on my way here
Good to see you, Mr Hirayama,
Mr Taguchi
lt's been a long time.
Did you just arrive in Tokyo today?
No, l had other business to attend to,
so l arrived yesterday
Thanks for taking care of my son
last time
Not at all
What was that?
My son went skating at Lake Haruna
last winter with his friends
They stayed at his inn
Thank you for the present you sent
Not at alI. Did you Iike them?
l pickled those spring
vegetables myself
It was nothing special...
...just a small token
of my appreciation
It was a wonderful gift
Oh, those wild vegetables we had?
They were deIicious
It's interesting, as we get oIder...
...we seem to enjoy such things
more and more
You're right
Things Iike seaweed with carrots...
...mushrooms, dried radish
and bean curd
Don't forget steak and pork cutIets
Is everyone present?
PIease, Iet us begin
PIease come through to the main halI
After you
- You're Iate
- l got held up
- We've just started
- Then l got here too early
That sutra recitaI today was Iong
lt went on
You can't compIain, you got here late!
Sorry for putting you through that
Mr Taguchi toId me that
shorter prayers were better...
. ..so I asked the priest
to keep it short. Didn't l?
The monk was eager to pIease
You must've paid him welI
Not at alI. l wasn't that generous!
At least it was cooler today.
The day of the funeral was so hot
It was realIy hot.
l was wearing a thick morning coat
How old were you, Ayako?
l was 1 8
- So now you're.. .?
- Twenty-four
Good age to get married, right?
Yes. Do tell us if you know someone
who'd be suitable for her
That won't be hard at all.
Ayako is very beautiful
What kind of men do you like?
Don't be shy
Tell us
How about someone like me,
for example?
Very nice
- And how about me?
- Very nice, too
You've confused me.
They're totally different types
And me?
You, too
- She only said 'you, too'. You're out
- l'm out?
You shouIdn't have bothered asking!
lt was a bad idea to ask her
Seriously, joking aside,
l might know someone suitable
- Yes, please
- ls that true?
Yes. Ayako, are you really
interested in getting married?
You shouId get married soon
How old were you
when you married Miwa?
l was 20
See, Ayako?
You should marry soon
Right. l think so, too
I know a nice feIlow, Ayako
l think he's about 29
He graduated
from the University of Tokyo...
...and works for the Obayashi Group
He's an interesting chap
Sounds too good for us
No, I think he'd be perfect
Then please introduce us
Ayako, it's time to go
Please excuse us
Already? It's stiII early
I'm sorry, but...
Sorry for troubling you today,
and thank you for all your kindness
l hope we haven't offended you
with our bluntness
Far from it. You kept us entertained.
l hope to see you all again soon
- See you soon
- Goodbye
Please excuse us
Goodbye, both of you. Ayako,
you know what you're doing, right?
Yes
She's so beautiful
I reaIly enjoy talking to girls her age
The girl's certainIy pretty, but...
- You mean her mother, don't you?
- Hmm. She hasn't changed a bit
- She's a beauty
- You think so?
- But her daughter's charming
- Of course she is
But Akiko is over 40 and still...
If I had to choose,
l'd pick the mother
She's lovely
LoveIy...Iovely
- You really think so?
- Absolutely
A man who marries someone
so beautiful is destined to die young
Miwa used up his luck too fast
She's developed a new kind
of charm recently
Yes. You think so, too?
You can just see it,
it's obvious
And you're usually so slow
to notice such things
l see it, too,
just not as clearly as you
What's making you aII so cheerfuI?
- Do you have enough sake ?
- Yes, we're fine
l'd say your husband must be
in good health
Yes, thank you
- l don't doubt it
- Of course
He'Il have a Iong Iife
You never know what'Il turn out
to be a blessing in disguise, right?
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing
A long time ago,
when we were all at university...
...there was a chemist's shop
on the third block in Hongo
lt's a fruit shop now, but there used
to be a beautiful girl working there
This one fancied her and bought
medicine there all the time
That's rich coming from you
Who bought all those decongestants
when he didn't even have a cold?
And he bought antibiotics
Yeah, l remember the packaging
The woman who was just here with us
was that girl
That lady?
l thought they were sisters,
not mother and daughter
She's very beautiful.
So what happened after that?
- Oh, well.. .
- lt ended badly
It's painfuI to telI
- You remember a man named Miwa?
- No
l think he came here once or twice
ln short, Miwa stole the girl
away from us
Goodness me!
You should've bought love potions
instead of flu medicine!
- You're right
- We weren't so wise back then
We were innocents
compared to the youth of today
ReaIly? Do you have enough sake,
Professor Hirayama?
Fine, thanks
WouId you bring me some soda water?
Of course. Just a moment
A man who marries a woman like that
will live an awfully long time
What was that?
Nothing. We were just talking.
Soda water?
Right away
A man who marries a woman like that
could still die young, though
- Have you seen the size of her?
- Good for wrestling?
The head scissors?
He wouldn't stand a chance
He'd be totalIy crushed
Some more?
- Welcome home
- Evening
You're home early
- l thought you'd be home late tonight
- Why's that?
Weren't you with Mr Mamiya
and Mr Hirayama?
Yes
And Akiko came, too, with Ayako
RealIy?
- What's this?
- lt's Yoko's
- She's back?
- Yes. She just arrived
Is her husband away on business?
They had another fight
Living with a mother-in-law
isn't easy for a young couple
Did she quarrel with his mother?
No, she gets on weIl with her.
But still, it's stressful
lt's better for a young couple
to live by themselves
I've often thought so myseIf
What shall we do with her?
She means to stay for a while
this time. She brought a bigger bag
- Do you think they'll sort it out?
- They have to...
...just Iike we did
l suppose so. A husband and wife
eventually get past that stage
Yes, they both do.
Yoko needs to make an effort
Right. You can't be too ambitious
in a relationship
True. You can't set
your hopes too high
- WouId you like a snack?
- No, l've eaten enough
WeIcome home, Dad
- What's up?
- lt's happened again
'Happened again'?
You're always fighting
What was it this time?
lt's hard to explain. lt's the result
of weeks of discontent
What do you mean, 'discontent'?
You chose to marry him
- Yes, that's why l'm upset
- About what?
Daddy, don't try to intervene.
l'm teaching him a lesson
You need to learn a lesson, too.
You're simply too impatient
Enough!
Dad, have a bath.
l'll heat up the water for you
She's hopeless
Oh, yes, you know that chap...
What's his name?
Who?
The man who works at the Obayashi
Group. Your friend's brother
You mean Shigeru lnoue?
That's the one
His father owns a music box factory
in Kamisuwa, right?
Yes. What about him?
He'd be a perfect husband for Ayako
- No. He's already engaged
- He's getting married?
Yes. l'm thinking of what to get them
as a wedding present
That's too bad.
l said l'd help her out
Why?
l thought he'd be good for her.
What a shame
Do we know any others?
- What about lkeda?
- No way. Too arrogant
No good? Do we know anyone else?
You should be worrying about
your own daughter, not someone else's
But Ayako's so beautifuI
- l don't want her marrying some idiot
- l see
She really is a nice girl.
Very wholesome
Does she look Iike Akiko
when she was young?
It's hard to compare
They're very different.
Mamiya says he prefers Akiko
- How about you?
- Me?
Who do you prefer?
Akiko, l bet. l know all about it
- About what?
- The third block in Hongo
You were always going there
to buy cold medicine, weren't you?
That wasn't me, that was Mamiya!
- So what did you buy?
- l bought antibiotics and other stuff
Don't lie. You bought cold medicine.
l remember it well
- Who told you that?
- You did
I told you? When?
Not long after Yoko was born.
You were drunk
ls that right?
l was being honest, l suppose
Yes, more honest than you are now
Mum, l'm hungry.
ls there anything to eat?
Dad, the bathwater's boiling
- Okay. Did you turn off the gas?
- lt's still on
You have to turn it off!
If it's not one thing, it's another!
- Do you have anything to eat?
- You're all hopeless!
Go on in
Nice to see you again
Thank you very much
for the other day. ..
...for taking the time to come
to the memorial service
Not at all. Please sit down
- l just came to thank you
- My pleasure. Have a seat
l stopped to see Mr Hirayama
and Mr Taguchi on my way
l see
So did Taguchi say anything
about matchmaking Ayako?
He said the young man had
already decided on someone
- He's getting married?
- Yes
That's typical of Taguchi.
He's always doing things like that
Miwa always complained about him
because he was never punctual
Although l was the one who came late
to the memorial service!
Miwa would have been glad
to see you all there
Have you had Iunch?
Not reaIly, but...
Shall we go out for lunch?
Not that l know any great places...
- But l have to be back by 2:00
- Back where?
I'm helping out at my friend's
dressmaking school these days
With French embroidery
- Are you teaching?
- Yes, though not very well
It must be a chalIenge
Let's have lunch together.
l'll drive you to the school after
Shall we go?
l'm leaving now. Get the car
- Have another glass
- No, thank you
You sure?
Did you notice the man who greeted me
at the lift as we were leaving?
No, sorry. l'm not very observant
He's a bit shorter than l am.
He had a fringe over his face
I reaIly didn't notice him
WelI, he doesn't realIy stand out
or anything
He's a good man
and an efficient worker
When we were talking
about a husband for Ayako...
... I thought of him immediately
But Taguchi was so quick to offer help
and he sounded so confident
Mr Taguchi is such a funny man
He's so funny that everything else
becomes funny when he gets involved
He's such a character, isn't he?
l can't remember
where this man graduated from
He's been with us
for four or five years
He may not Iook the athletic type...
...but he's captain
of our basketball team
How do you like the sound of him?
He sounds very nice
WouId you like to meet him?
Or maybe you'd like to see his photo
and background information first?
Yes, that wouId be better
Sorry to keep you waiting
Thank you
- l'll send them to you
- Please do
- Could you get me a photo of Ayako?
- Sure
Have you always smoked a pipe?
I smoke both cigarettes and pipes
My husband was fond of pipes, too.
We still have two or three at home
You can have them if you Iike
That would be nice.
l'd like that very much
I don't know if they're any good,
but some of them he bought in England
They must be good quality. He was
very particular about things like that
- Then l'll bring you one next time
- Thank you
- Please, help yourself
- Thank you
Coming!
Here you are, Dad
- l think he'd be perfect
- Who?
Mr Goto. He's a fine man
- You think so?
- Absolutely
lf it were me,
l'd say yes straight away
Where did he graduate from?
Waseda University.
He studied economics
The azure sky...
- Where's he from?
- Fushimi. His family runs a brewery
Can't you quieten down?
- Go to your room
- Why?
Just do it
Dai, too! Upstairs, now!
Waseda, Waseda,
Waseda University.!
l think Mr Goto's the best candidate
we know
I think so, too. I'Il invite him over
Ask him for a photo
and background information
I wilI
l wonder what Akiko will do
once Ayako is married. She'll be alone
She'll be fine. She has to be
ls Akiko as beautiful as ever?
Yes, very beautifuI
But l like Ayako better.
She's so innocent
RealIy?
Taguchi said he prefers Akiko
I think you do, too
- Who?
- Akiko
No way.
That's not me, that's Taguchi
He's liked her ever since
he was a young man
RealIy? And you haven't?
Not reaIly
Oh? Which medicines did you buy?
- What?
- Which medicine?
- Whose?
- Yours
Was it coId compresses
or decongestants?
Who told you this nonsense?
Taguchi's wife?
Now I know why you never catch coIds
You took too much medicine
back then
l'm home
Welcome back, Mum.
Have you had supper?
Mrs Sakai treated me to supper
- l've been waiting for you
- Really?
l bought some sweets
on the way home
- Do you want some now?
- l'll try some later
l'm exhausted.
l've been all over town today
Oh, Mr Taguchi's
matchmaking failed
RealIy? Why?
- The young man already has a fiancée
- He's always doing stuff like that
True enough.
But now there's another candidate
Another one?
l'm so popular all of a sudden
- Who's arranging it this time?
- Mr Mamiya. He sounds nice
- They work at the same company
- l see
He'll send us a photo
and some background information
I'm going to boiI some water
Mr Mamiya thinks very highly
of this young man
He wanted to mention him
the other day when we met
He says he wants a photo of you
- You know, Mum...
- What?
- Could you decline the offers?
- Why?
lt'll be harder to say no
once we have his picture
Don't give him my photo, either
- Do you want some tea?
- Sure
Listen, is there somebody you Iike?
Not at all!
Then why won't you consider this man?
So many people are concerned
about your well-being
You shouId be gratefuI
I know that, but l'm fine
with things the way they are
But...
RealIy, I don't want to get married yet
'Don't want to'?
Just sit down and listen to me
What is it?
- Tell me the truth
- What?
You really don't have
anybody else in mind?
l'd telI you if l did. l wouldn't hide
something like that from you
Okay...
I feeI fine as l am for the time being
- Make sure you decline his offer
- Are you sure?
Of course, l'm sure
Let's live together, just the two of us
The water's boiled
But once l falI in Iove with someone,
l'll probably change my mind
Wait a moment
Like this, okay?
That's aII for today
lf you have any questions,
feel free to ask me anytime
- ls your class over?
- Yes
Do you have a minute?
Please come in and take a seat
- Have you spoken to her?
- Not yet
- Do it, then
- You should do it yourself
You think so? Okay
Here, Akiko...
- What do you think of him?
- Who is he?
What do you think of him
for your daughter?
But isn't his nose crooked?
That's just the photo. It's the lighting
- Well.. .
- What is it?
Thank you, but Ayako says
she doesn't want to get married yet
- But...
- He's not suitable, anyway
But he's from a good family
The man's more important
than the family!
- We discussed this last night
- Shame to pass him up
It's no shame at all.
He's got no chance of succeeding, right?
That's not the point, reaIly
Just the other day, Ayako declined
a match arranged by Miwa's friend
- Why?
- She doesn't want to marry yet
Really?
Maybe you can't let her go, either
Not at all
But you need to give her away soon
lf she waits, she'lI end up
with someone who's not right
We can't aIl be as lucky as I was
- Yes?
- There's a call for Mrs Miwa
- A call? Transfer it to here
- Yes
- Thank you
- There you go
HeIIo? ls this Ayako? Yes, it's me
Yes, I can come
What time? Okay, no problem
Then I'Il meet you at the corner
I'Il Ieave early and
stop by Uncle Mamiya's on the way
Okay. Bye
I heard lshii couIdn't get the time off
He'd even bought the maps
and everything
- Why?
- His boss is really mean
- So there'll only be seven of us
- Right
l want to shop for hiking boots.
Come with me after work
Not today. l have an appointment
A date, huh? What's going on?
No, with my mum
How boring. Poor you
PIease go in
HeIlo. Nice to see you
HeIIo. I've brought you the pipe
The pipe? Oh, yes. Thanks a lot
Yes?
What is it?
Here.
Yes, this Iooks right
Show me that earlier file
Yes, sir
- Wait a minute
- Yes?
This is the young lady
who turned you down
RealIy?
Ayako, this is the man you decIined
My name's Goto. Please excuse me
- You're so mean
- Why?
You shouldn't have said that
I was onIy telling the truth
- But.. .
- But what? Will you reconsider?
No way
Here's the pipe
HoId on, Ayako
- l heard you work at Toko Trading
- Yes
Say hello to Sugiyama in Accounting.
We went to school together
I wilI
Excuse me
Here you go
- l'm so full
- You still have some beer left
l shouldn't let it go to waste.
l'll drink it
That's it
Here you go!
You know, once you get married...
...we won't be abIe to go out like this
Yes, we can.
l'm not getting married
EventuaIIy you wilI, though
Until then, we should go out together
once a month or so...
...and eat at nice restaurants
That was delicious
Even once every other month
would be fine
Yes, or once every three months
- l'll pay for it today
- No, l'll pay
You'll be short of funds for your trip.
You bought so many things
Don't worry.
l watch how l spend my money
It's a great idea...
. ..to go on a farewell hiking trip
before your friend gets married
We never thought of doing such things
when l was young
They're both into climbing,
that's why we thought of it
Wasn't it Yuriko's idea?
Be careful not to fall,
like in the film we just saw
Don't worry, l won't. It's a safe place
WeIl, that's good
You stiIl have some shopping to do,
so shall we go?
You wanted needles
for the sewing machine
- And another thing. Your favourite
- What?
Oh, salted roe
- Could you bring the bill, please?
- Okay!
- Mum, l'll pay
- No. You can pay next time
- You must be tired, Mum
- A little. But l had a lovely time
- Oh, l forgot
- What?
The soup mix.
Hopefully someone else will think of it
WeIl, don't we have some here?
Only three sachets left
You're just Iike your father
What?
You have to prepare everything
perfectly when you go travelling
Your father was just like that
He couldn't do without his pumice
stone at the hot springs
To rub his heels with? l remember that
l'd like to go to the hot springs
with you, Mum
Remember that time
we went to Shuzen Temple?
We saw all those carp
in the pond at the inn
And I threw buttered peanuts to them
and they ate them all up
Then we found the carp next morning
floating belly-up
l was shocked when l saw them,
but dad thought it was hilarious
That was the last trip
we took with your father
The budding maple leaves
were so beautiful
Know what? We should save
some money and take a trip
Where to?
We couId travel around
on a tourist pass
- We could visit uncle at lkaho, too
- Good idea. Let's do it
We won't be able to do that
after you get married
Mum, why are you so eager
to marry me off?
It has to happen eventuaIly
No, l'm not going to get married.
l'm staying as l am
But when l do find someone
l really care for, what do you think?
About what?
- Won't you get lonely?
- l will, but l'll have to bear it
I'Il be just fine
I'm sure my mother bore it, too
That's how it is
with mothers and daughters
Mum, shall we go to bed soon?
Okay. We need to get up early
I've had a Iovely time today
- Three of a kind
- A three?
- Here you go. Reach!
- That was quick
- You want this?
- Yes
- Then l'll give you this
- Okay, l'll take it
Reach with a bonus
makes three in a row
Can't you be a bit nicer
to the bridegroom-to-be?
Don't worry.
l gave you a gift just recently, didn't l?
Why did you have to come and play?
She's making your husband-to-be cry
RealIy? Don't be too hard on him
Hey, you sound Iike a wife aIready
What's the character for 'fresh'?
Fresh? lf it's about your bridegroom,
surely you mean 'gloomy'
'Fresh' is written...
l wrote it out in letters
Miwa, l heard you turned down Goto
- What?
- Goto who works at Sanwa Trading
l saw him in Shinjuku last night.
He told me you turned him down
l didn't. lt's not how it sounds
He's a good man. Don't reject him
I didn't! l didn't reject him
What are you taIking about?
You just keep your mind
on your own husband
Why would you reject
such a good man?
Shall l reintroduce you to him?
No, thanks
l will. You can count on me
lt's time
Today feels like a lucky day. The train
will probably be full of young couples
l wonder how Shigeko's doing right now
Are they sitting face-to-face
or shoulder-to-shoulder?
Whichever they like.
lt's none of our business
There it is!
She said she'd wave flowers at us
from the window
Maybe she forgot
How couId she?
She mentioned it so many times
Maybe she was feeIing shy
Besides, they couId've invited us
to the reception today
They should have
Maybe they just forgot about us
We joined the company together,
we've always been good friends
We'll all go our separate ways
eventually
That's what l hate about marriage.
ls it the same for men?
l don't know
lf friendship is just a temporary filler
until we get married.. .
...what's the point of aIl this?
You're right
It's stupid!
Sorry to keep you waiting
lt looks like we'Il have
a fine Sunday tomorrow
- I hope so. Bye
- Thank you very much
Welcome
Welcome
- Welcome
- A water and a cup of coffee
What a coincidence, seeing you here
- Where did you go, Ayako?
- To the cinema
The cinema? Have a seat
- But...
- Her, too
- But...
- Are you off some place else?
No, I'm going home now
Please excuse me. Goodnight
Ayako, don't you want to go with him?
No, I'm fine
- Then please sit down
- All right
Here you are, sir
- WouId you like to order something?
- No, thanks. l'm full
What's going on?
- What do you mean?
- With Goto
l met him for the first time today.
Somebody else introduced us
I introduced you first. lt was me
- But.. .
- But what?
A friend of Mr Goto's, Sugiyama,
works at my company
- That's why Sugiyama.. .
- Forget about Sugiyama
What do you think?
- About what?
- About Goto
- l met him the first time this evening
- You already said so
Stop teasing me
I'm not teasing you, l'm serious
Don't you think he's a nice felIow?
Do you like him? Do you?
- l don't know
- You don't know? Really?
l've no idea
No idea, huh? WelI, that's a problem
Supposing he's a nice young man...
...and supposing that you like him,
it's as simple as that
- What's simple?
- Marriage
- No way!
- What do you mean?
Suppose l fell in love
with somebody...
...there might be a number of reasons
for not being able to get married
RealIy? What reasons?
You mean financial reasons?
- That's one
- What are the others?
Like in my case, the girl might be
living alone with her mother
That's not an issue
You'll never get married if you insist
on staying with your mother
I don't need to get married
That's not right.
Women should, you know
Listen, UncIe, romance and marriage
are separate for me
Oh? What do you mean?
WeIl, how shalI I expIain?
You mean you could put up
with your husband's affairs?
- No, I'm not silly Iike that
- Oh, sorry
Of course, if you could combine
romance and marriage.. .
...that would be ideal
But l don't think you're unlucky
if you don't have both
You can stiII enjoy Iife
l think that's the case
for most couples
You think so?
Wouldn't you feel sad?
No, I wouIdn't.
l belong to a different generation
You're right
I'm happy Iiving with my mother
I'm very fortunate.
l'd rather keep living this way
You Iove your mother so much
You think so?
We often bicker, though
That proves you Iove her
A mother and a daughter wouldn't fight
unless they were very close
- You think so?
- Yes, l think so
She really is a good mother...
...and you're a good daughter, too
Young people these days
really are something
You get some strange ones,
of course
- l think what she says makes sense
- What?
Separating romance and marriage
lt's because the world is getting
more difficult to live in
And what do you think?
Do you think Ayako likes that fellow?
I think so, as far as I've seen
She tried to make excuses, though
That was a bit suspicious
- Who's this Sugiyama she mentioned?
- He's out of the picture now
So the issue here
is her concern for her mother
Yes
- That's easy to deal with
- How?
- We'll get the mother to marry first
- Remarry?
Yes! Then the daughter will marry.
That's both of them sorted out!
- You think that would work?
- Depends on how we persuade them
Sounds like a brilliant idea
If it worked out, it would be ideaI
lt wiIl work. Akiko is so pretty.
Who wouldn't marry her?
Then why don't you ask Akiko
if she's interested in remarrying?
- Do l have to do it?
- Of course, it's your idea
It's right that you do it
Give it a try. ..will you?
- Okay. l'll try
- Good
But l don't have anyone
lined up for her
How about Hirayama?
Me?
Yeah, that could work
That's not funny!
There's no way l could do it
She's the widow of a good friend
Don't be so uptight
No way
No way, it would be immoraI
There's nothing immoral about it.
You're a widower and she's a widow
l can't be so detached about it.
l couldn't do such a thing
WeIl, so much for that idea!
- But go ahead and ask her anyway
- l will, then
Don't you dare mention my name,
you hear me?
What a pity
You've been a widower for years
and what do you have to show for it?
I totally agree.
l wish l were in his place
Yeah, l wish l were in his place
I realIy do
- Welcome home, sir
- Evening
- Hi, Dad
- You're home?
- Have you had supper, sir?
- Yes, thanks
How about you?
l've eaten already.
l couldn't wait for you all night
l see
What were the scores?
Did you guess right?
Not too bad
What's the matter with you?
- What?
- You seem a bit down
- Has something happened?
- No, nothing
- l have to ask you something
- What?
I've declined, but my friends
are trying to play matchmaker
- For me?
- No, for me
For you?
Who's the woman?
Aside from who she might be,
what do you think?
That depends on who you're marrying.
Do l know her?
Tell me who it is
Don't hide it from me
- l'm not hiding it
- Then who is it? Tell me
You know Mrs Miwa, don't you?
Oh, her? She's great.
l'd be fine with her
So you approve?
Of course! And you declined?
- Sort of
- That's a stupid thing to do!
- Really?
- Yes!
- So you'd accept?
- Of course
Listen, Dad, l always hoped
you'd get remarried
Why?
I'm going to get married someday...
...and if you're still alone,
you'll end up living with us
You'd be in the way.
lt's not fair on my wife
ldiot!
And you wouIdn't like it, either
So you'd better marry Mrs Miwa
- lt's a great chance
- Chance?
But is she reaIly wilIing?
I don't know yet
What? You don't know?
You need to be more confident
- So you like the idea?
- Yes, l do. Absolutely
l see...
Dad, you look much happier now
Please enter
What is it?
Today's such a beautifuI day
Well...it's been like this
for a few days
Yes, it's Iovely
There was an earthquake
last night, though
RealIy? l didn't feeI it
There was. Only a small one, though
So what is it? What's the matter?
- What we discussed the other night...
- What's that?
You know,
when we were at the golf course
About employing students?
No, at the clubhouse
- What was it?
- About Miwa's wife
Did you think of a suitable man?
WeIl...l've given it some thought
- And?
- Well...
Remember what you suggested?
My son likes the idea
What did I say?
You remember!
No, I don't at alI
Stop pretending
l'm serious. Do you think Taguchi
has already asked her?
No idea... But you didn't seem
at all interested then
Yes, I know, I know...
...but life can be inconvenient
in a lot of ways for a widower
'lnconvenient'? You have a maid
I know that, but I just thought...
There's an itch that
your maid can't scratch?
Sort of
And you've suddenly developed
such an itch
Sort of
I don't know about your itches,
but what do you want me to do?
Well, I'd Iike you...
...to talk to her...about me
l think you should leave that
to Taguchi
No, that man talks too much
- l want you to do it instead
- Me?
Yes. Would you do it for me?
Well...
Will you get me Mr Taguchi
at Nitto Electric?
- Do you think Taguchi can handle it?
- No problem. That's what we agreed
But when he gets involved,
things tend to...
FaIl apart?
HeIIo? What? He's away?
- He's not there
- l see
- l'lI talk to him
- As soon as you can
Are you that itchy?
l'm no good at this,
no matter how old l am
- Where are you going?
- To the toilet
Welcome!
Welcome
So...where's Hirayama?
He's not here yet
- Did you talk to her?
- Yeah
- How did it go?
- Well...
... I got a bit sidetracked
Could l have a glass of whisky
with water?
I'Il have another, too
So what's the story?
She has absolutely no intention
of getting remarried
She talked about her late husband
from start to finish
Did you mention Ayako and Goto?
- Yes, l did
- What did she say?
She just smiled
and said, 'Oh, realIy?'
And what about Hirayama?
l couldn't mention his name
lt was like l'd gone there
to hear her talk about Miwa
l was touched
by what she told me, too
- So you didn't mention Hirayama?
- Nothing
Here you are, sirs
But Hirayama's serious
She's too good for Hirayama
She's as lovely as ever
l wish you'd been there
to see her moved to tears
Oh, really?
She was like a beautiful flower
in the rain
And she peeled an apple for me
with her gorgeous white hands
And you ate it?
l did indeed. lt was delicious
And she gave this
- What did you go there for?
- What are you getting at?
What about Hirayama?
There's nothing l can do.
Forget about him
- But he's in a hurry
- He can hurry all he wants!
Tell him to just put some ointment
on that itch of his
I guess we'd better forget about him
Yeah, forget him
Welcome!
That's him. He's here
- Hey
- Hi
Sorry l'm late
Hey, want a drink?
- Anything's fine
- All right
Have these as well
Taguchi, did you see her?
Yeah, l did
- Did you taIk to her?
- Yeah, l did
- How did it go?
- Well...
...you need to be patient
You need to be patient
RealIy?
- l feel sorry for Mr Hirayama
- l know
They're having fun at his expense
They're so bad, those two
Your husband's a bit better
Mine asked me the other day,
'lf l died, would you get remarried?'
And l said, 'No, l've had enough.'
Then he said, 'l would'
l asked him, 'To whom?'
He said, 'To Akiko, of course'
- RealIy? Mine's probably the same
- Pretty women have that advantage
That's so true. Makes me jealous
Akiko can't just suddenly
decide to get remarried
She won't say yes right away.
l wouldn't, either
Me, neither. Even if l were interested
- Right. They're so tactless
- l agree
- l'll see you Iater, Mum
- On a date, Michiko?
Yes, good guess. Until Iate tonight
- See you later
- Bye
What's to be done
with young people nowadays?
Mine's a headache, too
Things were simpIer in our day
All we wanted was
to go to the theatre
Yes, Mon Paris or
When Lilac Blooms
Nowadays, they listen to rockabilly
and that Presley
No wonder things like
dyed flowers are in fashion
How true
- Good afternoon
- Hello
We're taIking about matchmaking
Mrs Miwa's daughter
You should take care
of Ayako's marriage first
l don't think you have to worry
about Akiko's remarriage
Well, your husband came up
with that idea
ls that so?
He said it was your idea
No, it was Taguchi
- Whose is it, l wonder?
- Definitely Taguchi's
l heard you saw Akiko in tears and
thought she was stunningly beautiful
He said that?
He's terrible. It's the other way round
I bet he aIso said I ate the appIe
- Yes
- l heard it was delicious
Don't be siIly!
Anyway, we'll take care of Ayako
first, if you think that's better
Of course we do
We do indeed
I'd better leave you two to chat
Welcome!
Is Mr Mamiya here?
Yes, he's waiting for you
Ayako, I'm here
Please come in
I'm sorry I'm late
- You found it all right?
- Yes
Sit down
Make yourseIf comfortabIe
We don't have much time,
so l'll get straight down to business
lt's about your marriage.
What do you think of Goto?
- ln what way?
- Do you like him or not? Tell me
- l don't dislike him
- So you like him
He said he likes you, too
So just go ahead and marry him,
will you?
- But, Uncle...
- What?
l haven't decided yet
if l'll ever get married
That's what you said Iast time
So l can't give you an answer
right now
But if you like him,
why not get married?
But what would my mother do
if l got married?
- Ah, your mother...
- Yes
We've thought of her happiness, too.
We won't let her down
What do you mean?
For instance, what do you think
about your mother getting remarried?
Remarried?
ls that what she's considering?
Well, sort of
What do you think?
Sorry to keep you waiting
What's wrong?
You look like you're deep in thought
Is it definite, then?
- What? Your mother's remarriage?
- Who is he?
- The man?
- Yes
Since you and your mother
have known him for years...
... I thought Hirayama might be suitabIe
Mr Hirayama?
What do you think of him?
Are you not keen?
WeIl, it's not definite yet
What do you think?
WeIcome home. Are you hungry?
We've not got much for supper
l meant to shop on my way home,
but l was late, as well
What's wrong? What's happened?
What's the matter?
What's up with you?
l saw somebody today
who l haven't seen in years
lt was on the train
I wonder if you remember her
She often came round to sell rice
in the years after the war
She looked so elegant
l hardly recognised her
Mum?
Yes?
Have you been hiding something
from me?
Such as?
UncIe Mamiya told me
the whole thing today
What about?
Mum, are you planning
to get remarried?
Remarried?
Don't hide it from me any more!
Hide what?
- l know
- What do you know? What is this?
I'm completely Iost
Don't deny it! What about dad?
Didn't you think of him?
Wasn't Mr Hirayama
a friend of dad's?
- What about Mr Hirayama?
- You're still denying it?
Why wouId you hide it from me?
- What do you mean?
- Enough's enough!
l never thought you'd do this.
l hate all this secrecy
What are you talking about,
Ayako?
lt's sordid! l hate it!
Ayako, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Leave me alone!
l don't like what you're doing!
Here you go
- Cuttlefish, please
- And you, miss?
- l'd like some more of this
- Coming up!
Welcome!
Oh, welcome
- l came to see Yuriko
- Yes, she's in
Yuriko! Miss Miwa is here!
Coming!
PIease go on up
Nice to see you. Come on up.
My room's a mess, though
Please
Here you go!
WouId you like some more clams?
l'll have some
You do Iike your cIams, don't you?
Clams are delicious
They're poisonous, though,
if you're not careful
- How about some octopus?
- l've already had some octopus
I want some cIams, the softest part
- And some red shellfish
- Yes, sir!
So what did you say to her?
l hate it all the more because
he's my father's friend. lt's not right
- That's why you stormed out?
- Yes, because l think it's sordid
So that's what you think
I stiII remember my dad so welI
Why is my mother behaving
like she's forgotten him?
I just can't bear this
Listen, I can understand...
...but aren't you being a bit seIfish?
Why?
Look at it from your mother's
perspective
- What do you mean?
- Well, she's a woman, too, like you
- What are you saying?
- You have a boyfriend
Why shouIdn't your mother have one?
lsn't that selfish of you?
lf it were me, l'd just stay quiet
So you'd be fine with it
if you were me?
Of course.
l'd let my mother live her own life
- You'd feel differently in my place
- That's not true
lt was fine when my father
got remarried
lt didn't mean I'd forgotten
my late mother
Even now, when l close my eyes,
l can see my mother's face
My father's a bit sloppy,
but that's all right, he has his own life
But l don't think that
But you have no choice
You can't expect things
to be perfect in this world
You're acting Iike a baby
- Yuriko, here you are
- Thanks
Want something to eat?
Come on over here
I'm going home
Home? l thought you were
staying over tonight
- l'm going home
- Eat something before you go
I've had enough
You're reaIly going home?
Go home, then. What a baby!
Go on!
Where were you?
l've been worried about you,
running off like that
Where have you been?
What are you so upset about?
There's been a misunderstanding
What did Mr Mamiya teIl you?
What do you think I'm hiding from you?
I have no need to hide anything
You're the one who's hiding something
- What are you talking about?
- l'm talking about Mr Goto
You said nothing to me about him,
a man that you like
l've been waiting for you
to tell me about him
I've heard he's a reaIly nice man...
...and l've been reaIly happy for you
Why didn't you telI me?
- Morning
- Morning
See you
Morning
- Good morning
- Good morning
Did you make up with your mum
when you got home?
Are you stiII upset?
Fine, stay upset.
Stay like that forever
Thank you!
Here you go
- Welcome!
- Welcome!
That's not good,
quarrelling with your mother
I lost my mother
when l was quite young
Sometimes l think back
and wish l hadn't argued with her
Suddenly l remember
and regret what l did
l'm from Fushimi
We have these traditional dolls
made of clay
They used to be on a shelf
in the kitchen... Are you okay?
One day, when l was nine years old...
...I got angry about
some stupid little thing...
...and l broke all those dolls
l still remember the shocked look
on my mother's face
I had no good reason
l'd got home hungry and found
that supper wasn't ready yet
She died that autumn
- Really?
- So it's best not to quarrel
Never quarreI
You're right
Yes? Who is it?
Good evening
Oh, hello
- ls Ayako home?
- Not yet
But do come in
Please have a seat
Do you know where Ayako is?
- l don't know
- l sort of know...
I heard what happened Iast night
So she was at your house last night?
Yes. And l heard that
you're getting remarried
What's going on with you girIs?
So l told her she was being childish
getting upset about it
You have your reasons
for making your choices
- l suppose l do
- Ayako isn't being fair
She's just blaming you
without really thinking about it
l had a long talk with her,
but she refused to talk to me today
- Really?
- That's why l came over
The truth is that I think
she's overstepped the mark
Why's that?
If I were Ayako,
l'd rather you got remarried
RealIy? Why?
No offence, but I'd feel less
burdened if you were married
You may be right
Of course. Everyone thinks so
Ayako's the only one
who doesn't see it. She's so silly
I'd be a burden to her, wouldn't I?
No, of course not
WelI, maybe just a little burden.
Sorry. Will you be lonely?
There's nothing l can do about that
As long as she's happy, l'lI be happy
You're really amazing.
l'm glad we've had this chat
And l'm glad you've decided...
...because otherwise Ayako
would never get married
- You think so?
- Definitely. She's said so
Has she?
lf you decide to get married,
Ayako will quickly follow suit
She's so stubborn
She certainly is
l wonder what she's upset about.
lt's perfect, isn't it?
What is?
Mr Hirayama.
He's a college professor
And he was a friend of your husband's,
so he'll understand everything
But, Yuriko, you've misunderstood
No, I haven't. It'Il be fine
What's fine?
l think you've got mixed up
l know nothing about a match
with Mr Hirayama
Don't deny it.
There's no need to be shy!
Honestly, l know nothing about it
Believe me
RealIy?
How's that possibIe?
So you know nothing
about the match?
That's right.
l've heard nothing about it
That's terribIe.
Why is everyone talking about it?
You didn't know?
That's right
RealIy? That's so ridicuIous!
Welcome back.
Where have you been?
You're not stilI upset?
l came to see how you were doing
lt's none of your business.
Go home
Okay, l'll go
Yuriko, you can stay here tonight
No, Mum, l won't sleep
in the same house as her
- Ayako!
- No is no. She has to go
I'm leaving now!
Excuse me. Goodnight
You're reaIly Ieaving? l'm sorry
Don't care!
- Bye
- Bye
Sorry
lt's okay. She's just being stubborn
Yes?
Mr Hirayama is here to see you
What's up?
An odd situation
seems to have arisen
- What do you mean?
- A strange girl came to see me
- What?
- Anyway, l need you to meet her
- Who?
- She's waiting for you in reception
- Taguchi's with her, too
- Who are you talking about?
- Hi
- Hi
What's the matter?
Well...
That's her. She's a friend of Ayako's
My name is Yuriko Sasaki
My name's Mamiya.
Please have a seat
Please
l have one question for you.
Why are you spreading false stories?
What do you mean?
I'm talking about
Mrs Miwa's remarriage
- Oh, l see
- No, you don't see!
You told Ayako something that
Mrs Miwa knew nothing about!
Why would you disrupt
a perfectly happy family?
Ayako has suffered a great deal
because of you
Why would you disturb
their peace like that?
l want to know.
Please explain yourselves
Can't you tell me? What's so funny
about upsetting them?
We don't find it funny at alI
Then why?
Your name is Yuriko, right?
Please have a seat
I'm fine standing
But...
- Sit down, please
- No!
Thank goodness you have
a reception room here
This is exactly what she did to me
at the university
- By the way, Yuri-chan...
- Use my full name
Oh... l do apologise
I can expIain how it happened
I'm not asking you!
Right...
But what do you think about
the idea of Mrs Miwa remarrying?
- Good idea?
- Yes, it's a good idea
But that's beside the point
ActualIy, it isn't.
That's how Ayako is
She'll never get married
unless her mother remarries first
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?
Mrs Miwa knows nothing
about him, does she?
Hey, she said the same thing
to me earlier
What's going on? Didn't you mention
my name to Mrs Miwa?
Just stay quiet for now
- But...
- Hold your tongue
We seem to have made
a procedural mistake
For Ayako to be happily married,
her mother must remarry
- You understand that?
- Yes. But then why did you.. .?
l'm sorry for the mistake we made.
Please forgive us
I apologise to you, too
- Please sit down
- Please
Now the question is whether
Mrs Miwa is willing to be remarried
l asked her about that
- ls she?
- Yes
WeIl, that's good news
We'd like you to heIp us
We'lI take care of the mother first,
and then Ayako
- What do you think?
- That's fine with me
That makes sense to me
You've perked up again!
Has it already been decided
that he's to be her husband?
Well...
...nothing's definite yet
Do you object?
I have no objection
- l think he's fine
- Fine?
- Charming
- Charming?
- So, Hirayama, we should celebrate
- No, no
'No, no'? You owe us a big meaI
l do?
Fine, fine
- Where are you going?
- To the toilet
Many thanks!
Welcome!
That's quite a way.
lt's good sushi at your place, is it?
Yes, it is.
Let's have some hot sake
These humble littIe pIaces
often have surprisingly good food
Sorry about the 'humbleness'
- Aren't the master and his wife in?
- They've just stepped out
And their daughter?
Well, she's...
Their daughter's very pretty.
l wish you could meet her
Yuri-chan, are you okay?
Can you make it home from here?
Of course l can make it home.
l'm more concerned about you
- What would you like?
- Where's my sake ?
Just a moment
And what would you two Iike to eat?
- What do you recommend?
- Everything's good
Make an assortment, wiIl you?
We can't eat much, you know
Yes, we can.
The sushi here is really excellent
Serve us plenty
Hirayama, I'Il try to help you
persuade Mrs Miwa
- But can you truly Iove her?
- Yes, l can
Always and forever?
Yes, I can
He Iooks so happy, doesn't he?
He's very lucky
Here you are, your hot sake
I'm reaIly happy for you, Hirayama
Thank you so much.
l'm so grateful to my friends
It's not guaranteed yet, you know
- Don't say that
- Here you go
But honestly, can you reaIly love
my auntie forever?
Yes, I can
Always and forever?
Yes, I can
You're a sweet man.
Leave it to me, all right?
You're such a lucky feIIow
Welcome, everyone
Oh, you're back
- You're late today
- Yeah
They seem to know you very welI
- Do you come here often?
- Yeah, every day
Every day?
- Did you take the day off work?
- l left work at noon
- Mr Sugiyama called for you
- What did he say?
He said he'd taIk to you tomorrow
I get it. You Iive here
Yes, that was my mother
And l'm the daughter of the house
You're terrible!
You can eat as much as you like,
as long as you pay the bill
Of course l'll pay the bill
Serve us everything you can,
and sake, too
We're no match for
the young ladies nowadays
They're way ahead of us
- Tuna belly, please
- And some clams for me
But do you reaIly promise me?
Yes, I promise. l wilI Iove her
Not that!
l'm talking about paying the bill
Oh, l will, l will.
l'll be glad to
Red shellfish for me
l see. That's why Miwa's
taking a vacation
- They're travelling all over together
- l'm glad they made up
Ayako was upset at first,
but she managed to get over it
Seeing them,
l wished l had my real mother back
You've got a wonderful stepmother
She's nice,
but it's not the same thing
l'm trying to be
a good daughter to her
RealIy?
Can't you tell?
l must be acting well
- Here you go
- Thanks!
l wonder where Ayako is today?
l'm so envious of her
Shall we go hiking again
for the farewell party?
- We can invite Goto, too
- Let's do it
lt's a beautiful time of year
for hill-walking
- We shouldn't be in the office
- You're right
The lanterns twinkle
in the wan light of dusk
And the path winds its way
up to the old mountain hut
Staring longingly out of the window,
l reminisce about us
And songs of old are carried
on the wind...
Ayako, aren't you sIeepy?
No, not yet
lt's unfortunate
it's so crowded and noisy
But there are students
on school trips wherever we go
The hotel in Nikko was packed
with them. Wasn't it?
They kept taking our slippers
and entering our room by mistake
Did they? lt can't have been
very restful for you
But we still had a loveIy time
WeIl, that's good
Excuse me?
Sir, the teachers from the school
group want to talk to you
Okay, l'll be right along
l'm so glad that Ayako's found
a good bridegroom. ..
...and that you've decided
to get remarried
I was concerned about you...
...more so than I was about Ayako
Thank you for thinking of us
I'm just happy for you
Sleep well
- Goodnight
- Goodnight
Night
Shall we go to sleep now?
Ayako, come over here
It's quieter now
Maybe the schooI kids
have gone to bed
School trips were
always so much fun...
...but I never Iiked the Iast night
l was always so sad
that the trip was about to end
Did you ever feeI that way, too?
What's the matter? Mum?
Ayako...
. ..remember when you said
it was sordid for me to get remarried?
PIease forget about that
I'm sorry for what I said
To teIl you the truth,
l feel the same way
I've decided not to get remarried
But, Mum...
I'm stiII happy with your father
l'll continue to live
with his memories
That's all l want
l really have no desire
to start all over again
But, Mum...
l'll be fine
Don't worry about me any more.
Please marry Mr Goto
Nothing could give me
greater pleasure.. .
...than seeing you happily married
to someone you love
Just forget alI about me
I won't feeI loneIy at alI
But how can l leave you all alone
in that apartment?
l'll be fine
What kind of prospects will you have
if you stay with me?
You're young and blooming.
You have a bright future
There's so much happiness
waiting for you
Please get married to Mr Goto
I'Il be absolutely fine on my own
PIease do as I say
And please don't think l'm lying
just to convince you to get married
Listen to me.. .
You do understand, don't you?
I've realIy enjoyed this trip
Do you remember when
we lived here during the war?
Your dad would come home
every Sunday
Although we were penniless...
...he'd always find something
to bring back for you
He was a good father
This will be our Iast trip together
I want you to be happy
You have so much ahead of you...
...and so do l
l'll always remember
eating sweet beans with you here
...the leaves of crimson and ochre
How varied the colours
They scatter downwards
to the water's surface
Forming a flowing, richly hued brocade...
Wedding Reception
for the Goto and Miwa Families
I'm ready
Could the bridegroom
please turn this way a little?
Ready?
Hold. One more shot
Could you bring more sake
to that room?
lt went well today. We had
good weather and everything
It went reaIIy welI
lt was a rocky road,
but we had fun
We certainly did.
Let's toast to Ayako
And also to Miwa and Akiko
- Cheers
- Cheers
It wasn't much fun for me, though
Just remember that
we achieved our goal
Ayako is now happiIy married
l'm glad about that,
but l feel a bit used
At Ieast you alI got pipes
What, this?
But you had a good time,
dreaming pleasant dreams
Dreaming in vain
We tend to make things
complicated in life
Maybe Iife's simpler than we think
Speak for yourself!
That daughter from
the sushi restaurant? She's a one!
She was lots of fun
lt's refreshing to see a girl like that.
Sentimental girls are too much
Overly practical isn't good,
either, though
My daughter's aImost that age.
lt's hell for parents!
l wonder what Akiko will do,
though, all on her own
Are you stiII hoIding out hope?
No, I've given up
So your itches are gone now?
No, the itches stilI remain
But we had a good time together
We'lI have to think of something else
to bring us together
What about your daughter?
lsn't she of marriageable age?
No, not yet. And l won't need
any help from you two
Some more?
- There's whisky, too
- This is fine
It was alI good fun
Mrs Miwa? Are you stiII up?
Yuri-chan?
l just wanted to check
you were all right
We all went to the Ginza
after the reception
For you
Thank you
Ayako looked so beautifuI today...
...with her hair up
in the traditional style
You think so?
She said she didn't like it
It was perfect
Can l pop in to see you
from time to time?
Of course. Do come and see me.
l mean it
I'm glad that you Iook happy
Yes, l am. l'm very happy today,
thanks to you all
- And Ayako's happy
- She really is
She's blessed to have you
as a mother
I have to go now
WelI, thank you so much
for coming to see me
- Goodnight
- Goodnight
- Bye
- Bye
The End
