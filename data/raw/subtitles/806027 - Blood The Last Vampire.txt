We don't have much time,
gotta work.
Saya?
Something wrong?
Every bloodsucker you kill,
brings us one step closer.
I'm not here for those bottomfeeders.
There's only matter of time...
...and patience.
Jesus Christ.
Mike, something's not right.
- What?
There ain't no bloodsucker in there.
He's human.
It didn't have time to transform,
that's all.
You're gonna take her word for it?
What if she just screwed up?
Saya, that's enough.
Get some rest.
I'll be at the hotel tomorrow.
The little bitch is out of control.
- We need her.
Saya's all we've got.
Michael?
Let's go.
Three deaths on the American airbase
within a week.
Our cleaners got there in time.
Noone saw the bodies.
- The underlings are feeding.
You know what they're saying...
When the hungry demons feed
without discretion...
...Onigen is near.
You're about to get your wish.
Facet the leader of the pack.
The plan?
The council wants you on the base,
to find more on the leads.
I don't investigate,
I kill.
Be my guest, kill the bottom feeders...
...and you'll lure out - Onigen.
But this time, the blood we'll take.
- I was never wrong.
Doesn't hurt to be cautious. That's all.
And a... don't blow your cover
unless absolutely necessary.
The Elder pulled a lot of strings to arrange this.
Cover?
What's that?
It's a new outfit.
US Air Force Kanto Base - Tokio.
You know dad, you don't have to drive me
to the school everyday.
I can walk.
- Don't be silly.
It's my only chance to
spend some time with you.
Everyone else walks.
- You're not everyone, sweety.
But I ain't a kid either.
- Is that why you did it?
To prove that you're all grown up?
Did what?
- I was hoping you'd come clean.
That's what grown-ups do you know.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Well then, I guess it must've been Frank.
What do you say, Frank? - Sir?
Was it you who took my car out for a spin
last night?
No, sir.
- Did you sneak off the base?
Boogie at the Hippy-Shake until 4?
- No, sir.
I cannot believe this, you're spying on me?
I don't have to, Alice.
You are my daughter.
People know you
and people talk.
Ok, yah, I'm sorry, I should have told you.
It's just, you're always busy
day and night, working on your 2nd star.
You gotta understand
we're at war.
We're all at risk, even here.
- This is your war, not mine.
That's enough, Alice.
Hey! Watch where you're going, dammit!
- Yes, sir.
Alice!
Alice, would you come back here!
So... class, let's give
our new classmate a warm welcome.
There we go.
Saya, would you care to take
that desk over there?
Good, now I know
you've all been doing your homework and...
...and ah... you've prepared for today's readings...
.. which will be Mary Shelley's Frankestein.
Okie dokie, we're gonna start
on page 135.
She must be lost.
This is a navy base.
- I can't believe they let a jap enroll here.
Oh, next thing you know,
they're gonna think they own the base.
Ah... like Adam, I was created...
Yes, sir.
Our story stands.
They think it's a CIA plan.
Frankenstein's monster
compares himself with both...
...Adam and Lucifer.
Can you tell me why... Liz?
Um... beacause both Adam
and Lucifer were created by God?
Yes, but these are opposite ends
of good and evil.
Uh... to which end does the monster belong?
To whom does he reach out, in his anger?
Saya, would you care to join our discussion?
Yes, Alice?
- Anger is what makes the monster human.
He's neither good or evil.
He was abandoned by his creator
just like Lucifer.
So... God and Victor Frankenstein
both deserted their creation not because...
they were imperfect, but because they reminded them
of their own imperfections.
That's very interesting.
So... you think that God is an irresponsible...
father figure?
- She must be thinking about her dad.
What did you say?
Piss off the princess and
next thing you know her dad will court-marshall you!
Oh... it's not my fault.
Please don't send me to the chair!
Yes, now, settle down.. come one...
please.. let's be nice...
Um a... George, could you read the next paragraph?
A cursed creator,
why did you...
Concentrate Alice,
let the mind lead the body.
Good.
That's it for today.
What's our motto, team mugen?
Be wolf, be gone!
That's the spirit.
Alice.
Sir?
You're dragging down the whole team.
I want you to stay,
and practice.
But I have to...
D'you think you're gonna get a special
treatment just coz you're general's daughter?
I didn't say that.
I'll spar with Alice.
- And I will be the ref.
No, I'll.. practice on my own.
A- a, gotta think of the team,
we have a tournament next week.
Make a wolf from Alice for me girls.
- Yes, Mr. Powell.
Bring it on.
What are you doing?
We tried very very hard to ignore you.
And you just keep getting on our nerves.
Are you insane?
Go.
Secure that vehicle.
Who are they?
- We don't know yet, sir.
Step out.
Unlock the doors and step out right now.
Hey pal, what do you think you're doing...
- Stop right there, fella!
Ho-ho, easy, big guy.
Do we look like Vietcong?
You keep your hands where I can see em, wise ass.
General, Michael Harrison.
director of operations, CIA.
Those men work for us.
What are you spooks doing on my base?
- That's classified...
Langley sent us to assist
with the war effort.
In what capacity?
Last time I checked, DoD doesn't,
come under your jurisdiction.
Am I talking to you?
- General.
My superior will call you shortly.
Now I suggest we all calm down...
...and handle this like the professionals
we are. Ok?
Keep an eye on 'em, Frank.
- Yes, sir.
They were here. I saw them.
Sharon...
Linda's head was...
- Everything is okay, sweetie...
...you're safe now,
and that's all that matters.
I saw them.
The Japanese girl, Frank
why was she in our school?
Washington arranged her enrollment, sir.
- Washington?
The registrar says her name is Saya,
she is a daughter of Matoki Shisekura...
...a soon to be appointed the ambassador to DC.
Well you conform that with our local liasion.
You get a warrant issued and find her.
They cleaned it all up.
Dad, look. It's still wet.
We're gonna find out what these guys are doing, Frank.
- That could be a problem, sir.
We don't have the authority,
to detain the Agency personnel.
I'll deal with that.
I respectfully disagree, sir.
Then I will have to file an official
complaint with the Pentagon.
Understand, sir.
- Dad, whoever they are,...
they covered up two murders,
we can't let them go.
Cut em loose, Frank. Alice?
- Yes, sir.
Stand-down.
Son of a bitch.
What's wrong with you?
Talking to him like that.
In case you didn't notice,
they pulled their guns on me.
You gotta clean up this mess,
or the council will wanna have our heads.
What the hell were you thinking anyway?
Sending Saya to a high school.
She's older than all of us combined.
- Yeah?
Christ.
The Elder wants to see us.
Something was wrong with them?
Linda's blood...
Sweety, you're still in a shock,
it's understandable.
You go get some sleep.
You have to believe me,
Mr. Powell knows something.
How can he know anything if he wasn't even there!
Now would you just go get some sleep!
Dad, you're wrong.
Alice, that's enough.
Look would you just leave it to the grown-ups.
We'll talk in the morning.
Yes?
Frank, what do you have?
Yeah, just as I said, if there were to be a new ambassador,
I would've been briefed
Guys with sunglasses and funny hats...
waving their cheeky badges around and now I was
supposed to believe they were sent by Langley?
Do whatever you can.
Find out who they are,
and what the hell are they doing on my base.
Sir?
Sit.
Everything according to plan?
- Yes, sir.
Rumor has it McKee was calling Langley
and Washington.
Very curious about the both of you.
Was that part of your plan?
We had a run-in with him.
Yes.
Having American friends in high places,
doesn't mean I'm Uncle Sam.
A little discretion would be nice.
The council has to remain anonymous.
And American connection cannot risk
exposure.
Don't get to cozy playing CIA.
I'll take care of it.
Leave it to me.
You have my word, sir.
Hungry?
Starving.
- Here is something to curb your appetite.
Plane crashed near the Okatana mountains this morning.
Those are the crew members on board.
What's left of them anyway.
Thank you.
This is Onigen's work.
Those photos were taken,
before we cleaned up the scene.
Noone else knows
- He's here?
He's at the base?
- Yeah.
Now Onigen's here...
...blood will be shed.
Oh I'm very sorry, I didn't notice...
It's been 20 years since we've had people visit, but I hope you'll enjoy your stay.
I also noticed, you won't be needing any help with luggage?
Observant and caring, your wife is a lucky lady.
Yes.
As long you think so.
Shin, my daughter is preparing dinner.
It will be ready soon in the dining room.
I can't believe that!
Sorry!
Why are you still standing there?!
Come out and play my children.
The feeding season has begun.
Kinky, how's life?
***
- The usual?
On the Rocks.
Hi, Alice chan. Irashai!
What's your poison tonight?
Leave us.
You lied.
You knew Linda and Sharon were gonna
hurt me and you lied to my dad.
Why me?
What did I do?
What...
What do you want from me?
- It's all about you, you, you, isn't it?
What if you're wrong, delusional,
ever thought about that?
I know what I saw.
What you see, has got
nothing to do with what's real.
You look around, you see an airbase
run by your daddy...
flying his B52's to wipe out gook
farmers out on the rice paddies...
Fighting his righteous war.
But you don't see the real war.
The one that's been going on
since the beginning of time.
Between your kind - and mine.
The end is upon you.
Brought on by your self-deceiving godliness.
And your pretentious moral high ground.
We will come out the victors.
Welcome to the other side of the looking glass.
Now it's time,
to die!
Hey! Hey, stop. Stop, hey, please!
Let her go!
Get down.
He's getting away.
- He's wounded.
Get closer.
Faster.
Faster.
Get closer.
Closer.
Can you sense her?
Mr. Powell, Sharon and Linda...
all of them...
- They never existed.
What exactly were they?
Bloodsuckers.
They take on human form.
It's the way they live.
So I guess you're not
really a student, are you?
Are there... more of those...
things out there?
More than you can imagine.
Anything I can do?
It's not your war.
Go home.
And forget everything.
And leave you fighting them alone?
I can take care of myself.
M'y dad is the general at the base,
I can tell 'im and he can...
Don't tell anyone!
- Why?
You want to live?
You want your father to live?
Then don't.
Alright. He wouldn't believe me anyway.
Saya.
Be really careful, okay?
Did they see you?
- No, sir.
Are these weapons?
- No, I don't think so.
They were a total of 4 cases.
Mostly standard issues,
as far as I can tell.
From the Agency?
- No I don't think these guys are from the Agency at all.
Call on the tech guys.
What in the God's name are these things?
Slugs, snails and puppy dogs' tails.
Easy.
We're here to talk.
That's all.
How dare you enter
my home uninvited?
My apologies, old habits die hard.
Been with the Agency one day too long, I guess.
What do you want?
- Did you authorize the burglary, general?
You're not taking it back, it's evidence.
- Of what?
That's for central command to decide.
- Wait.
General, I've always thought we got off on the wrong foot.
It's my fault.
But we're on the same side.
I assure you.
- The side that murdered two highschool girls?
I don't think so.
I've come here to give you Saya, general.
She's not with the Agency.
I can't be held responsible,
if she's out of control.
Where is she?
Get this down, Frank.
Hotel Yuzoya,
Tokoshiginga Street Ni Shiao 57...
Hang on!
Tell me the street again.
Tokoshi-ginza.
- I know it.
It's in the Shinigawa Ward,
about 30 minutes from here.
You've left me with no choice, General.
I can leave the case with you.
- Who are you people?
Saviours of the human race.
The council has been around, since...
before your granddaddy's granddaddy
stole this land from the Indians.
We walk a higher path, General.
Run Alice, run!
Dad!
Dad...
No, Alice. Get off the Base.
You're not safe here.
- I don't know what to do!
Alice, leave.
I love you, sweetie.
Dad? No!
Dad!
Fucking A!
They were taken at the Onsen hotel.
Onigen?
She's looking for you.
It's time we fought back.
Everything's been arranged but ah...
It's not gonna be easy.
I don't care.
The council finds Onigen for me,
that's the deal.
It's already taken too long.
You ever think about the future?
After this?
There is more to life than Onigen.
Not for me.
Damn.
How did you find me?
I killed them.
You're right,
she showed.
Copy that, I'm on my way.
Take her out! Take her out now! Do it now!
Do it! Now!
Hurry up!
The poeple you work for,
they killed my dad.
I don't work for them.
- You're lying!
Domo.
I kill the bloodsuckers, they provide me
what I need to survive.
That's all.
Why my dad?
Why?
I'll find out from Michael.
Down!
Give me the girl, Saya.
No.
- This has nothing to do with you.
Don't mess with me, Halfblood.
Luke?
Michael.
- Put down the gun.
Put it down!
- He killed McKee.
Are you insane? What the hell
you think you're doing?
My job. I've cleaned up the mess, haven't I?
- You're making a bigger mess!
Not when I get that girl.
No.
- Luke. I'm not gonna tell you again.
You're not gonna shoot me, Michael.
- Try me.
Okay, you win.
But don't think I'm not gonna
tell the Elders all about this.
Be my guest. Coz I'm not the one
jeopardizing our mission.
You're getting soft, old man.
- Maybe, but not stupid.
You alright?
Who's stupid now?
We have to go.
Wait.
You drive.
Radio Free Japan, top of the hour.
Commanding Officer of the Kanto Air Force Base,
General Howard R. McKee has died of a heart attack.
The General was discovered in critical condition
at his home a few hours ago.
The doctors on the scene
were unable to resuscitate him.
Authorities are asking for your help
in finding his daughter Alice McKee...
who fled the Base in an Air Force truck
shortly after hearing the news.
A Base Psychiatrist described her
as unstable and cautioned that her life might be at risk.
Saya, are you okay?
Saya.
Wake up.
Saya, wake up.
Your blood?
Why'd you save me?
I'm not your kind.
It was the right thing to do.
The right thing?
I used to know right from wrong.
Life used to feel right.
Kato raised me in the mountain village.
That I called home.
But I found the only friend in my life.
Happiness and love was within reach.
But then the dark dream came.
In the dream, I killed him.
Love was gone, replaced by blood.
Saya-sama!
Then I woke up, and it was not a dream.
What happened?
Please take your father's sword.
I don't understand...
This sword...
has the power to slay demons.
It is a blessing, and a curse.
You still have much to learn...
However...
We have no more time!
The demons have found us!
Kato...
Kato
Wait here...
And don't come out!
I told you not to follow!
But we need to stick together-
We mustn't!
Kato...
There is no need, I must go alone.
You...
Just what are you planning?
I must complete my mission.
You can't, Kato!
You cannot face the demons yet.
It is my task for now.
Now, go!
Why are you still standing there?!
Are you okay?
You are...thinking about your father?
Yes.
Just all the little things.
What about you?
Your family?
My mother...
I never knew her.
My father...
He died, two days
after I was born.
How?
Onigen murdered him.
The oldest, most powerful demon.
My father's most loyal retainer...
Kato...
...saved me.
He took me into the mountains.
Cared for me.
Trained me to be strong.
To be like my father.
In the end, he died for me.
Many a-times, Kato told me about
my father's murder.
How demons deceived him in the
most despicable way.
That day I finally understood.
I'm my father's daughter.
But I'm also the evil
that killed him.
Since that night...
...time stopped.
I live for one purpose.
And one purpose only.
To kill Onigen.
That's my duty.
Kato was right.
Demons can't conjur up
humans' souls.
Promise me one thing also.
Never doubt yourself.
You're human.
I promise.
So much pain, so much struggle...
...silly girl, she's close by.
Bring her to me.
- Alive?
Still holding a grudge?
The Halfblood owes me.
- Don't be ridiculous...
her power is far beyond of what it used to be.
Huh, we'll see about that.
Let me out.
What?
You go alone.
Too dangerous to stay with me.
No, it's our war now.
Come on.
Come on.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Alice!
Dad, don't go.
- It's me! It's me Alice!
Please wake up!
Okay, let's go!
Saya!
Alice!
This isn't really happening.
None of it.
You.
You're alive.
Saya!
He isn't real.
This isn't really happening.
None of it.
No, he's alive.
You finally found me.
And I've found you.
Look at you, my girl.
Eaten alive by guilt over single human.
Yet not a tear for having slaughtered
so many of your own kind.
I'm not your kind.
Denying...sad it is.
You are after all your father's child.
I see you're taking good care of his soul.
- Show me your true form, Onigen.
Why do you want to see it?
- The demon?
Who murdered my father?
The demon...
- Who I will kill.
You knew all along, didn't you?
Deep down in your heart.
I gave you your strength.
I gave you your power.
I gave you immortality.
My daughter.
Silly girl.
You've suffered long enough.
Come to me.
No!
I've waited a long time, Saya.
For you to gain your strength.
To be ready.
You think, more of the demons you killed,...
the more human you become, don't you?
How naive.
The truth is...
The more you kill,...
...the more you unleash your power...
...you come to your true nature.
Don't you see?
You've been doing everything you could
to become what you don't want to be.
To become me.
- Never.
It's your destiny, silly girl.
It is what you were born for.
The future lies in you.
Let her go!
Alice!
Alice!
Don't you see now?
Which half of you gives you strength?
Which half makes you feeble?
Get it all out.
Unleash yourself.
- You gave birth to me.
And you could kill me.
But you're nothing to me!
You don't know...
What it means to be a mother!
Kill me, my daughter.
Kill me.
And become me!
Saya.
Saya.
Are you okay?
What's the point?
You don't believe me.
These monsters...
One of them attacked the army truck you stole?
But when we found you at
the bottom of the ravine,...
you were alone.
They cleaned it up.
They?
- The Council.
They killed my father.
Yes.
General McKee...
mortally wounded by a
sidearm registered to Officer Sgt. Frank Nielsen.
Sergeant Nielsen lost his son,
in war, three months ago.
This psych evaluation show...
...instability.
And this girl, you mentioned?
Saya, I believe?
Her name, her identity were false.
In fact, we believe she's not even Japanese.
Where is she right now?
She's out there.
Searching.
Searching for what?
Searching for a way back.
From the other side of the looking glass.
