Is Miró here?
I'm sorry about that. He went to Milan
-Where is he? - I assure you,
he went to an exhibition.
An exhibition...
Anything.
By my mother, I was going to call you!
-Come on.
-What's the matter?
-You'll see.
-What did I do?
-Give me back the money you owe me.
- Soon, God willing.
-Don't worry, God wants it, we all want it.
Only you don't want
-What were you doing? -Hiding?
Do you want us to kneel down?
-Calm down. Tell him to calm down.
It's not me, it's the bank.
They took everything from me,
I can't write checks anymore.
The credit card is my mother's credit card.
If you knew all the money
I lost to them.
They always go on the rampage
the little ones like me.
How small?
Look at the place you've got!
Don't play with me.
Give me my money back!
Where do you want me to get it?
I'm broke.
I'm on the street.
Look, they took everything from me.
-Stop it! It's no use!
-You gave me your word.
Sorry, we have nothing.
I'm fed up.
We can't go on like this.
You're right, Le Sentier died.
He won't pay us.
From now on it's over,
we will work...
...with the distribution, with the payers,
they comply.
Are you out of your mind?
Do you know what we are to them?
-Dwarves, ants...
-It doesn't cost anything to try.
-We don't have a choice.
-That's what I was telling you.
And what do you propose?
If we go on like this it's bankruptcy.
We can't work
with those bastards.
They're like scorpions, they won't leave you.
Ask Zituni.
Who is Zituni?
He has no guts.
I'm warning you,
we'll tear them to pieces.
We won't tear anything to pieces...
Sergio! Darling!
Sergio! - What?
-Phone, your cousin Patrick.
-Patrick?
-Patrick? -Hello, cousin.
-Hello, cousin...
-...I need a big favor.
-I have a friend arriving from
I have a friend arriving from São Paulo, but I have a meeting...
... important.
Be nice, go get it.
I'm having a crazy day!
Never mind, I was going to offer you the Rolls.
The Rolls?
Hold on, I'll check my schedule.
The poor thing...
If she comes from San Pablo...
-What about expenses?
-What expenses?
You have everything you need at home.
You make her wait...
...you offer her a drink. But don't touch her!
-What do you take me for?
-Is that it?
-Yes, let's go.
-Yes, because we also wanted to play.
-We'll play.
It's not possible... Who is this guy?
What does he think he is?
What is happening? I concentrate.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm not in shape.
Where is the valet?
I'm not kidding, it's a disaster.
Please, it's the yellow car.
Thank you!
Thanks, but I already have mine.
It's just that one.
Mine's the Rolls.
Don't go for a ride with it.
Then you park the lady's.
Here are the keys.
I'm sorry, really.
I'm Yoyana Butbul.
Sergio Benamu.
-A pleasure.
-My pleasure.
Have a nice day.
-I have an appointment with someone.
-His name?
Patrick Abitbol.
I am Sergio Benamu...
...but Patrick Abitbol is my cousin
who set up the appointment.
I'll go and see. Follow me.
I thought it was the valet.
Thank you.
I'm Sergio Benamu...
...I'm Patrick's cousin, he asked me
to come and pick you up.
-Why?
-He had an inconvenience...
-I'm sorry.
-Ah! -No!
-No, it's already too much.
-Wait!
-95 francs.
-Put them on Mr. Abitbol's account.
See that young lady's table?
Send her a bottle of champagne...
- ... from Sergio Benamu.
-In charge of Mr. Abitbol? -Mr. Abitbol?
You got it!
We're here!
How cute!
Wait!
Very good!
-Take me back.
-Patrick will be here any minute.
There is no "my love"!
No!
No! I'm so angry!
I don't want to wait until tomorrow!
No, it will be worse for you!
Patrick is not coming.
-He'll pay for them!
-What do you mean, he's not coming?
-What are you doing?
-Sergio mio!
He's my cousin, I can't do this to him.
We have no obligation
to tell you.
-For God's sake!
This is going to be terrible!
Do you have condoms?
If you have condoms.
Where are they?
Damn it! I'm a traitor!
A traitor, I am a traitor!
-Hurry up!
-I'm coming!
You'll see what I do to you!
Where are you?
Where are you?
You're there!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Wait, wait, wait!
-Get dressed, you turn me on!
-They're idiots!
Stop it! Stop it! You too, Eddie.
I thought you were my friend!
I didn't agree.
They forced me.
-Happy Birthday Sergio! -Happy Birthday Sergio!
-Stop it! I look like what?
How handsome you are!
-Stop it!
-You're handsome in slip! Show me!
-Stop it! -Get off me!
-Happy birthday, love... -Happy birthday, love...
How lucky you are!
Do you get angry?
If anyone should be angry here...
-that's me, you cretin.
-Why?
-I asked you to take care of my friend -and you jump on her.
and you jump on her.
-Me?
I soon realized that it was a joke!
it was a joke!
-Besides, I was just leaving!
-In a slip?
Do you take me for a fool?
You disappoint me.
By the eyes of Uncle Maurizio,
I would never do such a thing. I swear it!
You should have, because for what it cost me,...
...you got to do it twice.
Happy birthday to you.
I swear to you. I didn't foresee it.
I was at work.
Don't start that again.
Stop it! Stop it! My wife is here,
I can't talk to you.
Is that right? That's why... Hello?
Dov, my love. Where were you?
I was here...
You're weird... Trouble?
-I thought about your debts... -What debts?
-What debts?
You ask me what debts?
It's been 20 years, not to say since you were
I've been asking you for money.
Listen to Patrick. I save money,
but it's not easy.
-I have a new job.
-Are you Stiul's errand boy?
He told me you're always late.
Don't touch that. It costs an arm and a leg
an arm and a leg.
Can you hear me?
I've got some great news
for you.
You don't owe me anything anymore.
-Really?
-For my life. You don't owe me anything anymore.
-Shall we go back to zero?
-We stay at zero.
This is a change of course.
Relax.
Factory Mode!
-Relax!
-I'll dirty my pants.
He smiles.
Don't smile.
-Good morning, sir... -Good morning, sir...
-Sir...
No, I'm not convinced...
Look at the finish!
Just look at the finish.
Frankly, who works like that
these days?
I think we are wasting our time.
If you waste your time...
Afraid you won't sell it?
I propose the following.
If he doesn't sell it, which he won't,
he returns it...
... without any conditions, everything
that you have not sold.
-That's good!
-Eddie...
Denis Vierhuten, head of the
Purchasing Department.
Eddie Vuibert, and he is my collaborator,
Ivan Tuatí.
Mr. Vierhuten I'm leaving.
Thank you Roman, it was perfect,
as always.
So?
-How cute these bunnies are!
-That's what I was saying. Charming.
-It's my daughters' idea.
-Interesting. -Great!
I want to see everything. Come with me
to my office.
Willy?
-Do you like it?
-Yes!
If you wanted to, you could buy it.
I told you, come work for me
for me.
You won't spend your whole life
as a messenger.
I don't know. I have to think about it.
Don't think about it too much, you could
make a lot of money.
Sergio!
If I tell you it's because
I love you, do you understand?
-I'm leaving. I'm in a hurry.
-Sergio!
-Yes?
-It's a serious proposal.
Yes, of course...
Sergio!
Don't forget that you're a winner.
My "BM", my "BM"...
...I meant we were rich.
Patrick, please, what is this?
It was made by a Greek sculptor.
In California it causes a sensation.
What is it for?
It's art, you idiot. Do you know
how much I paid for it? 40 grand.
Cash, too, because he wouldn't take checks.
he didn't accept checks.
What is it good for?
For nothing. To put it in your house.
Please don't touch it.
The maid has already scratched it.
Is it a museum evening? You've been bugging me
you've been bugging me about it.
-Let's play! - And the ads?
-80 in diamonds for you.
-Are you crazy? - You said 90!
-I don't play anymore, you're crazy!
-I never said that!
-Keep this and we'll see!
-Who's the boss?
-Where did you get the ace?
From my balls!
Show me what you got!
From your balls?
Is that how you talk to your cousin?
-Patrick, stop it, play.
-Let go of me.
What were you doing at Willy Journo's?
Me? Nothing.
I saw you in his shop.
What do you want?
-That you go into their "business"?
-Enough, let's play.
He's my cousin and I don't want him
to go to jail.
Do you know what he does with his brother?
They endorse bearer checks,...
... the one who goes to the Bank, puts
his name on it...
... and a week later he brings you
the cash and gives them 2%.
-No, the 5th
-Are you making fun of me?
-Stop it!
-Are you laughing at me?
Okay, I saw it, but I told him I wasn't interested.
I wasn't interested.
It's the truth. On my life!
Hello? How are you, dear?
Well? Where are you?
Is that all you're wearing?
You're a whore...
That's why I adore you. No, not right away.
I'm in a meeting.
My friends are lovely.
Yes, they heard everything.
No, I didn't tell them who you were.
You know me...
Okay, I'll leave you.
I send you a kiss.
I swear, I didn't tell them.
A kiss. That was Martina.
I was sure!
Which Martina?
Which Matina? Martina.
-You don't know Martina? - No, I haven't.
-You've never introduced her to Martina?
Shall I introduce her to you?
Stop making jokes sometime!
Do you want me to call her?
-Forget it!
-He can't.
Martina is terrible.
I swear.
No more jokes!
I'm an electric drill.
-Shall I call her or not?
-Yes, yes!
But watch out. Did you see how I talked to him?
You must speak to him frankly,
without beating around the bush.
You must excite her thoroughly,
otherwise it's over.
Hello? Don't hang up, one second...
Hello? I'm a friend of Dov's...
...told me you're looking for a well-hung
well-endowed guy.
Well... you're in luck, 'cause you don't
know what I have.
You know what I'll do to you?
I'll make you eat it.
Sergio?
Is that you, my son?
Mommy?
You bastards!
Sons of bitches!!!
They make me say that
to my mother!
They make me tell my mother that!
Now I'm calling yours!
-I'll call yours!
-Give me the cell phone!
Who was it?
-I think we have a problem.
-What problem?
We made a mistake
with your models.
A serious mistake.
We should have asked for more.
The bunnies work
very well.
-Can we have some more?
-Of course.
-We'll get organized.
-Very well.
I buy 8 references from you.
There are 160 garments.
That's 35,520 for all our supermarkets.
our supermarkets.
Is the cost-sharing
is it insured?
To cover business
of the business.
If they start to become a major supplier...
suppliers... And that's not all!
Did you tell them about the
gondola tip?
We will display your models
at the entrance of the shops.
-An advertisement... -When we like something
we like, we don't skimp.
An employee is needed to
organize the section...
... another to replenish, a promoter...
-We won't pay for it.
-They're your employees, aren't they?
Yes, but the time they spend with
their clothes, they don't spend it...
... selling the goods of
us, that's the problem.
-That's true. - I don't agree,
it's not normal.
What is normal nowadays?
Things change.
The difference between you and me
is that for me your collection...
... it's just a business.
-While for you ....
-Maybe it will be the last.
Okay, how much will it cost us?
-400,000 or maybe 500, but no more.
-You know what?
We're good, they'll be in the
catalog for nothing.
300,000 francs, excluding taxes.
Coffee! It's for us.
No, thank you.
Okay, that's it.
I forgot! Great news.
We will merge with
the Kommercia Group
Do they realize the market?
They will have 500 hypermarkets
instead of 200.
What do you plan to do with the "cow"?
-What? - What "cow"?
-For the bride's present.
The merger costs us
a lot of money.
We ask for just one gesture
Excuse me, but I don't understand.
I will help you. We want 5% of
your annual turnover,...
... otherwise there is no business.
That's funny! That's amazing!
There's something we forgot to point out.
It's important Eddie.
What time is the "kiss"?
-I'm sorry?
-What time do I "kiss" him?
-He's joking.
-What's this "cow" thing?
-Do they want to cheat us?
-Any problem? -No.
No problem at all. My friend is
a little nervous...
...because we don't work
much lately.
What stupidity is that?
Can't you see that it's a trick?
-Don't look at me like that!
-Come on.
I'm sorry. Take it all the wrong way.
Where were we?
Don't make that face!
We'll find other customers.
Which ones? There are no more customers.
Vierhuten has us tied up
and we have no choice.
I don't want to fire these people
because of your mood.
What state of mind?
They are corrupt!
-What are we going to do?
-30,000 more garments.
-What?
-Are you kidding me?
I negotiated 30,000 more garments.
They like rabbits.
This logo is gold.
It has no limits.
You know what, Eddie?
You're a genius.
And I'll keep you in line,
because of you I had to...
... sponsoring the annual Eurodiscount
annual Eurodiscount marathon.
-Did you make a nuisance of yourself?
-Of course not.
-When will you calm down?
-I'm calm, go to hell.
You scared me, don't you sleep?
Did you see what time it is?
What's that? You're leaving?
Me? No. You're leaving.
-What?
-You're leaving, Dov. It's over.
Are you out of your mind?
Did you blow a wire?
Isabel told me everything.
Karina, it's not what you think.
You scum! How could you do that to me?!
The whole salon knows it!
It happened once, I went to get a haircut,
he jumped on me...
-Who are you talking about?
-The hairdresser.
You cretin! I was telling you about the
pharmacist!
-Karina!
-I don't want to see you again!
-It was foolish, I beg your pardon!
-You have no business here!
-You're leaving!
-Enough Karina!
Is that clear? You're leaving!
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm leaving!
A problem with the buttons.
Fredy made us 80 and not 85.
Don't argue, we're late.
Our daughter? My daughter!
I'm gonna take Rebecca and I'm gonna put her
up there.
-What's wrong with her?
-Karina wants a divorce.
I've been sleeping in the car
in the car, you don't mind.
I lost 100 pounds in 10 days, don't mind me.
It's okay. Get a lawyer.
The door is open.
Let us go on then.
We got work to do! Let's go!
Fuck!
Be careful, it is very fragile.
It's for the owner of Muebleco,
his daughter is getting married.
By the way, look for my tickets
for Lara Fabian.
-Don't forget. The guy told me
they were the last ones.
-It's okay.
-Did you understand? You leave the gift and go.
-As usual.
No, not as usual.
Damn! The priority!
Fuck it! No!
Don't forget the tickets
for Lara Fabian!
-I have a delivery.
-Put it there.
Ask Ricky, he is Lara's
Lara's manager.
Mr. Benamu?
Sergio?
Sergio? Remember me?
Yoyana Butbul.
How are you doing?
All right! That's funny!
Do you know that I am Dina's sister?
-Dina?
-Yes, the bride.
Excuse me, I have to go.
You can't leave,
the party's just getting started.
-I'll introduce you to my father. -Daddy?
-Yes, dear?
I wanted to introduce them.
Sergio Benamu, my father.
-How do you do?
-Sir...
-I'm sorry, I've just come from the Pole...
-And you left the horse outside?
Are you deaf, you cretin?
I'm looking for you everywhere,
Where are you?
What is it?
Answer back!
-Let's go.
-Go!
-Stay 5 minutes.
-Don't worry.
-Bravo!
-Congratulations!
Congratulations!
-Who is he? -Do you know him?
-No, not yet.
Some park anywhere.
anywhere.
-What are you doing here?
-It's okay, I'm not looking.
Excuse me, excuse me. Thank you.
That's what I thought. The entire
collection is a small size.
-Did he give you a .38?
-Yes
How can this be?
She is 42
-What size are you?
-38
If she's 38, I'm 2
-Maybe.
-What's wrong? -Any problem?
-All the collection has wrong
the sizes. -What does it say?
Relax. Mr. Lopez
knows his job.
It's the wrong size.
Not a single wrinkle.
-It's not 38, give it a 42 and you'll see.
-This is not Le Sentier
Rules must be respected.
You can't tell me that, I did everything
you asked me to do.
-I accepted all their conditions.
-Reject the goods.
-Is this a joke?
-So you'll know for the next one.
What is the meaning of all this foul play?
It can't be!
Do you think I'll let myself be fooled like that?
Did you leave like that?
With the merchandise?
Did you want me to force him?
We did get duped.
They found a cheaper supplier.
I don't care about that.
If I don't find a solution,
I'm dead.
I put my personal guarantee on this.
We can lose everything.
Don't you have anything to say?
-This is all your fault.
-Mia?
Who got us excited about
the great distribution?
Don't fuck around, Dov!
We have enough problems as it is!
What's the problem? We lost a customer.
We got over it other times.
Not this time! He mortgaged his assets...
-Do you know what it means?
-What will I tell Sandra?
I called you all day at the office,
but you didn't answer.
-Hello, dear.
-Your secretary is strange.
You look bad.
Are you all right?
Yeah, it's just the neighbor.
I'm sick of him.
I have a surprise for you.
Sit down, relax.
-Health.
-Health.
I must...
-I must tell you something.
-I'll go first.
I have some good news and some
bad news to tell you.
What do you think is the good news?
-I don't know. Does it have to do with dance?
-No.
Ana is getting a tooth.
No.
I am pregnant.
-It can't be.
-How can it not be?
-Aren't you happy?
-Of course I am.
-No.
-Yes, I assure you.
What's the good one,
Sorry, the bad one?
The baby is not very well implanted.
I must be careful and rest...
-avoid the unpleasantness.
-Ah! -Yeah?
-What's wrong? -Changed your mind?
-No.
I am very happy.
It's great.
We may have to buy
another car and move.
-We're a little tight here.
-Yes, of course.
I tell you frankly,
it won't be pleasant.
They are very powerful
and they play hard.
If they lose, it can
set Jurisprudence.
I manufactured, I invested, I bet everything
everything to this business.
I have no choice.
I'm playing for my life.
We will have to ask the
Court to appoint an Expert.
Perfect. We are in the presence
of a scam.
I don't want to cheat him,
it will cost dearly.
I'll manage.
-Will you go to the markets?
-Of course I will.
I knew you were stubborn,
but not to such an extent.
The lawyer is charging me a fortune.
I have a family to feed.
-Do you have a better idea?
-Is that the way up the hill?
-I got started in the markets. I know what it is.
-It's temporary.
I must hold out for three months, until the
until the Expert witness is issued,...
-and kill them. What's the matter? Are you afraid of getting up early?
-No, I'm not.
My father asked me to work with him,
I can't refuse.
I understand. I understand.
-You're not mad?
-No. -It's okay.
I'm going to Los Angeles
Karina has changed since Rebeca was born.
We used to make love
all the time. Now we...
... he only cares about the little one.
-He didn't try to hold you back.
-I was pretending, what are you saying?
I could tell he was dying
for me to stay.
She's in love, poor thing,
but I've had enough.
It absorbed me too much.
Today I feel like exploding,
to feel alive. Alive!
And making love revives me.
You'll see Dov.
We won't leave anyone standing.
If anyone's rounding on Karina,
let me know. Thank you.
That is friendship.
It's what's left when
everything is lost.
Can you help me with the bags?
-He's your cousin, don't bother.
-Cretino!
Goodbye Patrick
I'm counting on you. You pick up the car
and you leave, you don't touch anything.
No problem.
Don't touch the cars and don't
do anything foolish.
You don't know me, I've changed a lot.
Thank you.
Here, the papers.
-Strength to the nerve!
-Goodbye!
What a show!
I loved it!
It's amazing that you got
got tickets.
I know his manager.
She wanted us to have dinner with Lara,
but she was busy.
What a commitment on stage!
Thank you.
Where will you take me for dinner?
You'll see. It's a surprise.
Wait...
They're here. Excuse me.
It's my weakness.
Bubul! Sergio!
What are you doing in that car?
Did you win the Lottery?
Who is he? Do you know him?
I had never seen him before. Maybe he wanted to
to impress his girl.
What a lot of liars there are! Eh?
Scary!
Tell me a little about yourself.
You seem so discreet and mysterious.
Nothing interesting. I didn't study engineering,
nor did I do a Master's degree...
...in economics like you. I'm in
a School of Graphic Arts.
Tell me, there's something I've been wanting
I've been wanting to ask you for a while now.
How can it be that a man
as successful as you...
...is still single? You must be
in demand.
You know... it's very simple.
I don't have time.
I work 16 hours a day,
I travel a lot...
What little time I have left,
I spend it at the edge of my pool...
-alone, reading.
-Reading?
Yes, I read a lot.
Sartre, Mauriac, Kandinsky...
-Kandinsky?
-Yes, it helps me a lot.
-Your bill, sir...
-I'm sorry, excuse me.
Put it on Mr. Abitbol's account,
you know him, he's my cousin.
Yes, of course.
-And bring me a bottle of champagne.
-And bring me a bottle of champagne.
I'm sorry Mr. Abitbol closed his account
his account before he left.
No way!
Until further notice.
Shall I bring you the bottle?
No, it wouldn't be convenient,
because I have to travel on the road.
Very well, thank you.
Ivan! You must save my life.
Two thousand francs, it's not much.
This time I'll give it back to you.
Ivan I swear I'm not lying!
I'll give it back to you tomorrow
in the morning... Ivan!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Sergio! How are you?
Willy, yeah, all right.
It doesn't look like it.
Do you want to relax?
No, you must do me a favor.
I need money.
-How much?
-Two thousand. I forgot my wallet.
I'll come by the store tomorrow
and I'll bring it back to you. Okay?
-All right. -Thank you.
-But I'm sleeping with her.
-What?
-Your girl, he's sleeping with her.
That's normal. He pays the bill
and you leave.
Doesn't that seem fair?
What does this mean?
You know as well as I do that I'll never
to see my money again.
How are you gonna pay me back 2 grand,
if you can't afford dinner?
-I must have compensation.
-What's more, I want to add 500.
-It's okay, guys.
-Don't be angry, my Sergio!
You could earn 2,000
francs in 5 minutes.
-You could go to dinner every night.
-Let him, he doesn't want to.
He prefers to
errand boy on his motorbike.
It's okay. They beat me.
No, you won.
Come and see me tomorrow.
Thanks guys.
You're a winner, Sergio!
I couldn't go to see Lara Fabian,
they stole my tickets.
If I see that fucker,
he's a dead man.
I'll get you tickets
to Laruso.
I'm sorry, I had an
important call.
-I thought you'd gone.
-But of course I didn't.
What is this?
He'll hear me.
It's been an hour since I ordered
a bottle of champagne.
-What are you waiting for?
-It's all right, sir.
"It's all right, sir," is all
I hear.
-See you tomorrow?
-I don't think that's reasonable.
You don't like me? Not even a little bit?
No! It's not that silly!
But you say yourself that you're
always traveling on business.
And I don't like to wait.
I don't want to suffer.
If I travel it's because I've never
I've never met anyone like you.
-Is it true?
-Of course it is.
Who was the girl from the
"Club de l'Etoile"?
But it wasn't! She was a f...
She was a friend.
Sergio, don't try to lie to me.
I can tell right away.
Do you want the truth?
It's true, I have a life...
It's true that I went out a lot,
that I don't go unnoticed.
But I'm tired of
I'm tired of adventures with no future,...
... from the show business, from the
models between 2 planes...
All that is over.
I am a simple person.
And I need love.
And I'm crazy about you.
But this, it is true.
-What are you doing? Did you see what time it is?
-What time is it?
-It's 5 o'clock
All 5? Are you sure?
I don't know what's wrong with you, you look strange.
Come and lie down.
No, I'm awake now.
Since you're up,
Do you give Ana the bottle?
Where were you?
I looked for you everywhere.
No way! Did you come?
I kicked my father out, I'd had enough,
I couldn't take it anymore.
Are you out of your mind?
Why did you put yourself here?
-What do you have?
-We can't sell clothes
next to the cheese.
-It stinks! - I was told to
to stand here.
And you put on.
-You can't put us there,
find another place.
-I don't have one.
-Where do you want me to put them?
-I don't know, find something.
-You can't do that to us.
-If there isn't, there isn't.
We could stand next to the belts.
side of the belts.
-Look, it's a collector.
-No. You buy places.
It's a gift, indulge me.
Do me the favor.
-You didn't give him your Rolex!
-Yes, it was a gift from my father.
-You're crazy!
-No, they are bought for 50 Francs in Vintimille.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's true!
It's California fashion,...
... everyone uses it in the USA.
They come in all price ranges.
There are 25,000
-That's 1,200 for you.
-That's all right.
You deposit the check and bring us
the cash in 5 days.
If the banker asks you a question,
you tell him you opened a shop...
... in the neighborhood. As long as it goes in
the bank doesn't care.
Come on! I'll call you!
You're a winner, Sergio!
I've always told you that.
It's good to see you.
Ever since Dov left,
I've been abandoned.
Don't say that Karina,
with the market we don't have time anymore.
What he wanted is for you to call Dov.
At least have a drink.
Do you know where he is?
I'm going to change, I can't take it anymore.
Rebeca, put on your pajamas.
Wash yourself well.
-Mom, Ivan is looking at you naked!
-No, I'm looking for the glasses.
Never mind Karina, I'm leaving.
Come Rebeca, put on your pajamas.
Hello dear.
How are you?
What beautiful glasses!
You look beautiful, my love.
When you see the bill,
5,000 francs.
Is that so?
Yes, very nice, love.
I have to call the bank, at the
pharmacy they turned me down...
- ...the credit card.
-Don't call, I'll take care of it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm coming!
I'm sorry. I was on the phone. I was on the phone.
Come on in.
What's this? "P.A."?
-This... is the mark... -This is the mark...
"Peter Allawi." - Peter Allawi?
Yeah, it's Australian, I make
all my shirts there.
-Do you need help?
-No, it's okay.
It is superb your Takismeros.
I love it. It is sublime.
Yeah, it cost me 40 grand.
It's useless, but it's art.
-Health.
-Health.
Out of the way!
That's enough. We're back!
-What's the matter?
-We have to go back.
What's the plan?
I'm having fun.
She wants to be left alone.
Get your things, and get out.
-You go and get your things.
-You're hurting me.
What infuriates me is that
it took me by surprise...
-...or else I'd break his face.
-Sit down, I'll be right back.
Don't bother, I'm leaving.
I assure you.
5 minutes.
Let me see.
No big deal. Hold this.
You scared me, I thought you were
you were going to hit me.
No.
Don't you like to see me dance?
Yes, but it was the alcohol.
I'm sorry about that.
-Am I hurting you?
-No.
What's going on?
I'm going, I'm tired.
It's better. Here you are.
-Thank you.
-Bye.
Ivan! No!
Are you crazy? Stop it!
How are you?
Pleased to meet you.
Karina. It's me.
Dov? Do you know what time it is?
You know who I'm with?
Mel Gibson.
I spoke to him. When he goes to Paris,
he'll stop by.
-Shall I pass it to you?
-Dov...
Karina! Mel Gibson!
Lethal Weapon 1, 2, 3,4
-You don't know what a commotion!
-Dov, I'm sleeping.
I always forget. Did she tell you
the babysitter to call last night?
-Yes. -You went out?
Did you go somewhere?
-We're looking for Mr. Vuibert.
-I know him.
-What is it about?
-Justice Officer.
Is it the 4th door on the right?
No, Mr. Agenor is on the
4th on the right.
Mr. Vuibert is on the left.
There is a blue and red mat.
-Thank you, Lord.
-You're welcome.
Come on gentlemen.
All right, all right, all right. Open up.
-I don't have an appointment.
-I have an appointment in 3 minutes.
-Why did they fall into my house?
-I can't do anything about it.
-No activity for 3 months.
-No activity? I work day and night.
I get up at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Everything I earn is for you.
-It's not up to me, you know.
-It's the management. -How long has it been...
-... Is it necessary to stop them?
-It's impossible.
In compensation we only have
200,000 francs.
I'll bring you half in 2 weeks.
-10 days.
-All right.
-In exchange I want 3 months of time
to resume the activity.
It's all right.
-I'm taking a big risk.
-Not as much as I do, Mr. Vanier.
Not like me.
I want to speak to
Mr. Denis Vierhuten.
Mr. Vanier, BRL Bank.
Mr. Vierhuten, I am Mr. Vanier.
I've got good news.
It's almost fixed.
Don't worry, you don't have any
chance to save yourself.
My love, wake up.
We must go. My father
gets up in an hour.
I don't like to take you
in the middle of the night.
-Don't worry, I'll take a taxi.
-No, I didn't say that.
No, I feel like waking up with you.
I want to swoon in your arms...
...take your coffee to bed with you.
I want us to be
a normal couple.
My love! It's the most
beautiful day of my life.
-My parents will be overjoyed.
-Your parents?
-Why? - When we announce
our wedding.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We need to talk.
-That's great!
-We need to talk.
-A cigarette?
-No, not now.
You know Sergio?
I had everything a man could
man could wish for.
A wonderful wife, two lovely daughters,...
... beautiful, kind, intelligent.
I succeeded in business.
But I regret not having a child.
But God heard me.
Dinah married Simon...
...and now there's you.
-You know Mr. Butbul... -You know Mr. Butbul...
-Please, my name is Mauricio... -Mauricio...
-... and you call me by my first name.
-All right... You know...
This is me talking.
I have a very healthy business.
It's not just the shops.
There's the factory, the sawmill,...
... and then there are the forests.
All that my age is very difficult.
I can't hold out much longer.
I need someone...
...that can happen to me,
someone you can trust.
This is not for Simon,
he's a doctor, the poor guy.
-You know I'm not at all in the...
-The furniture business?
I know. But you engineers...
...they know how to adapt, don't they?
I'm old school,
as they say.
Today, in order to survive, you have to
the company in a different way.
For that, you'd be...
... perfect!
-It's not possible.
-I know you have your business.
I'm not asking you to drop everything.
Think about it.
Darling, did you ask Sergio
when they can come...
-... to dinner your parents?
-My parents? -Why?
To get to know them before the
marriage. It is the minimum.
First they were on a trip,
then your father...
... had a Golf Tournament.
-You don't want to hide them?
-No...
-Maybe we're not up to their standards.
-No, the truth is that...
Enough! Tell them to
come for Shabbat.
Don't argue.
We are honored to receive you.
Thank you very much. Bye!
What do you have today? No way!
Nothing, I'm fine.
I was just thinking about something.
I have a friend who is
madly in love...
...of his best friend's wife.
-Did you sleep with Karina?
-Why do you say that?
You didn't do it?!
How to foresee it?
That girl is like my sister.
-Did you fall in love?
-I don't know. It's very recent.
You know her, she's magnificent.
What about Dov?
-Dov?
-Yes, Dov. He's your friend.
You'll have to tell him.
-Mr. Vuibert?
-It's me.
I'm sorry, but we must
seize the merchandise.
A written request from Mr. Vanier
of the BRL Bank.
What's the problem?
-I have my taxes...
-Don't touch anything please.
Don't touch anything!
Let go of me!
They operated on my finger! Stop it!
You're hurting me!
He gave me 3 months
and asks for the lien to be lifted.
We had to give everything
what we earned.
I don't understand.
He encouraged us in the big distribution.
I never passed that guy.
-I warn you, it won't stay that way.
-Calm down.
-How do I pay?
-Don't worry.
We'll have the report from the
Expert the day after tomorrow.
Really?
I didn't believe it anymore.
How handsome my son is!
-Mordeyai, come!
-What a jacket!
Doesn't he look like Roger Lanzac?
Thank you mom, what a joy.
You couldn't flatter me more.
Isn't this too much?
How too much? It's a Versace!
It scares me. It will ruin everything.
Do you want to embarrass yourself in front of
your future daughter-in-law's parents?
Do not ask them any questions.
It may make them uncomfortable.
Especially with Yoyana's father's
of Yoyana's father.
-What illness?
-Yoyana doesn't want me to talk.
It's important! Tell us!
What's wrong with it?
It's got... it's got...
His head fails him.
-Does he have Alzheimer's?
-Alzheimer's.
Not as much, but almost.
He says things you don't understand,
asks questions...
... confuses people.
-You have to pretend it's nothing.
-What a disgrace!
How do you do your job?
He is Director of Muebleco,
that's no small thing.
He hasn't been in the office for months.
He is still Director...
...because they don't want to grieve him,
but he can't direct anything.
That's why he's asking me to take charge.
I hope it's not hereditary.
I'm coming!
Mom, be careful about
Sergio's father.
-Do you promise, Dad?
-Don't worry...
...we'll pretend it's nothing. I have a
supplier who's depressive...
-I know what it is.
-I hope it's not congenital.
What are you saying? Your son is an engineer.
Sometimes it can skip a generation.
Promise?
I never get home from the office
before 8 o'clock.
A line of tables comes out...
...and I have to take care of everything,
a crazy job.
-Of course, I understand.
-That's why I'm counting on your son....
...to come to work
with me. I hope you find...
... someone you trust to take care of
to take care of the restaurant.
Which restaurant?
-Well, the...
-Wait...
I'm sorry.
-His son's restaurant in
Los Angeles, in the United States.
Do you remember?
-Dad, the restaurant!
-The restaurant?
Ah! Yes!
It's true! Where's my head?
The head!
The restaurant!
What if we talk about the wedding?
As you know, Yoyana is my oldest daughter.
I want you to have all the best.
The best.
The Limousine of Loiseau and
the flowers of Vera.
And I want the reception
to be at "Pré Catelan".
Dear...
I don't know about your side, but on our side...
... between family and friends are
at least 250 people.
Are you OK?
Excuse me.
And for the Catering I thought of
"Le Notre" (ours)
Why not? And who is it?
How?
Catering? Who will do it?
"Le Notre", but if you prefer yours.
prefer yours
-No, yours is fine.
-Perfect.
So who is it?
I understand, they don't want to say it.
Well, I'll check my calendar,
see what dates are possible.
Don't you know where I put the glasses?
They are right in front of you.
Poor thing, his head is failing him.
Yes, we are aware.
-Here's 200,000. -You know what?
You will need to open a
third account.
You take the money out little by little.
little by little. Be discreet Sergio!
That's all right. But I'd like to
to speed up the chain.
You made almost 40,000 this month.
Not enough for you?
I'm getting married and I have to make sure.
I can't go on with crumbs.
We can't do any more.
The Bank will find it strange.
No problem.
I said I had the start-up.
What is this stupidity?
Don't you know? High-tech!
It's a magic word!
You say it to a banker,
he opens your chest and kisses your ass.
High-tech?
What I like about you Sergio,
is that you're ambitious.
Doctor?
It came out wrong. The Expert witness deemed
your merchandise defective...
-... and you're 100% right about Eurodiscount.
-Are you kidding?
-I'm sorry. We have to stop everything.
-Let's ask for another expert opinion.
It won't do any good.
The best thing to do is to give up the trial
while there's still time.
-He spent his money for nothing.
-It can't be.
-Doctor...
-Goodbye.
I know him. Who is he?
It is the Expert.
No way, it was in
Eurodiscount. He works for them.
-You bastard! -Come here!
-The expertise must be rejected.
-You have to denounce the expert.
-Be reasonable.
-I gave you all my money, didn't I?
-Stop it!
-Please!
-It won't end like this.
-Do you like your job?
-It will cost you dearly for the other day.
-Leave her.
-Stop it, Lord.
-Leave that there.
-Listen.
I'm going to my mother's house.
I won't stay here without...
...no electricity, no gas, no phone.
We're leaving.
Who am I to you?
When will you stop taking me for an idiot?
I called the bank. It's been
We've been like this for months.
Why did you lie to me?
-Why don't you trust me?
-Listen, my dear.
-Come on.
-Leave me alone.
Slow down. What's going on?
What's wrong with you?
Do you feel bad?
Breathe dear.
Breathe.
Go ahead.
Hello.
How do you feel?
-Okay.
-I was unfair to you.
I should have guessed. With you
you always have to guess.
Let me talk, I have something
important to tell you.
-Me too.
-Wait, Sandra.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
I hid everything from you because
I wanted to protect them.
To you and the girls.
We don't have anything anymore.
He is a child.
It will be difficult, but...
A child?
Is it true? Is it a boy?
-What could be more important than this?
-It's wonderful.
A girl, too, would have been
would have been wonderful.
I am very proud of
my daughters! But he is a boy.
It is a sign from God.
We hit rock bottom, we won't go down anymore
Eddie?
Eddie?
Oh! Sergio!
-How are you? -Meet Yoyana.
Yoyana. We're getting married.
-Really? -Congratulations!
-Hello! -Thank you!
It's good to see you! You're doing great!
You know we're expecting a baby?
It's a boy.
It is the most beautiful thing in life.
When I saw the car I thought
it was Patrick.
-I have to go.
-Do you have any news?
We'll call each other and I'll tell you everything.
You will receive an invitation.
Good luck!
-Your change.
-Thank you, sir. Goodbye, sir.
-What are you doing?
-They're my rabbits!
Look at it! Look at it!
It is not possible!
There too!
MADE IN CHINA.
Eddie, that's not a good idea!
Wait. Calm down!
Eddie, wait! They'll arrest us!
Stop it!
Never!
-Never! -You're right,
they're bastards.
-All this is mine!
-You're a jerk!
We're leaving. Let him go!
-Eddie! Look who's over there!
-You bastard, I'll get you! -You'll pay for this!
It took time.
You'll pay me back my
money back a hundred times!
-You're finished, you'll pay for this!
-You bastard!
You're finished, you idiot.
Good evening, Madam.
-Thank you.
-Good evening, Mr. Benamu. -Good evening, Mr. Benamu.
-Have a nice evening.
-Don't jinx me.
Hello? (phone ringing)
Willy! I was thinking of you.
Start playing,
I'm coming.
How much can I spend?
I told you. You are "no limit".
Wrong. Charlie had a visit
from the police. We stopped everything.
How do we stop everything?
-2.8 for mom...
-I have commitments!
I'm getting married in a month.
Congratulations. It's your fault.
You wanted to speed up the cadence.
Seriously, I need that job.
-Don't leave me at this time.
-Give us back the money.
-What money?
-Are you kidding me?
In two weeks we gave you
over 200,000 in checks.
-I'll expect you tomorrow.
-What do you want me to do?
Sergio? Don't tell me you
you spent the money.
Wait, I'm going through a tunnel.
Hello? Hello?
You don't mind if we go back?
I'm exhausted.
-Play, it will relax you, it will do you good.
-Not tonight, I don't feel like it.
-Doesn't it bother you?
-No. I don't have any more tokens anyway.
Shall we go?
Dad wants to know if you have
the Catering answer.
Employees!
Dad. Can I have the doll,
please?
Here you go, dear.
It's to pay your debts.
Oh, my love.
You're very good.
Thank you, my love.
Then I can pay for everything.
Here you go, dear.
Are you okay, Dad?
-Yes, dear.
-Are you coming to dinner?
Everything is going very well.
Everything is going very well.
-What's going on?
-Everything is going very well.
Wait for it.
-What's the matter?
-Oh! -You... you...
Ivan? I found him.
We got it.
We will destroy Vierhuten,
I'll take care of every detail.
The problem is the initial investment.
It has to be done...
... big or it won't work.
I thought about Patrick,
but it won't be easy.
You must speak to him discreetly.
Brother, I'm happy to see you.
-Me too.
-Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.
Ivan! Where's Karina?
It's because of the small...
What's going on? Did you tell him I was coming?
Of course it is, but it's not simple...
-you should think about it. - What stupidity is that?
It's been a month since I left.
-What must he think?
-What about Los Angeles?
-Women? -Say something!
-Do you think he had his head in it?
There are pretty girls, the problem
with the Yankees is that...
-... they don't make love anymore.
-They don't really do it often.
I'm telling you, they don't make love anymore.
Their thing is dates.
That's what they like, to have a
"date with a girl.
-Ah! -I have a date!
-Why do you want to be in debt? -Are you crazy?
Not debts, but "dates",
it means "dates".
On a "date" you think you'll
you'll make love, but you won't.
Is Karina seeing anyone?
What?
-Dov, I need to talk to you.
-Shit! I had a feeling, I swear!
All day long she talked to me about Karina.
She learned only one word
in English: "Karen".
I'll kill him. On the head
of my daughter, he's dead.
You can't get all worked up
over a girl.
Did you think I'd wait for you
after what you did to him?
Put yourself in her shoes.
-She's seeing someone but it's not serious. -No?
-No...
-Who is that bastard? -Do I know him?
-No.
Enough of this! One thing's for sure.
You won't get her back by going crazy.
-Calm down. - He's right.
Calm down with all this.
Goodbye.
SERGIO BENAMU
-Why stoic? I'll kill that guy...
...and I'll rip it all out.
It's selfish to reason like that.
Think of Karina,...
...he's not happy. He suffered a lot.
He wants to rebuild his life.
I don't want him to remake it!
Do you understand?
I can't live without her.
I thought a lot over there.
-We're forever.
-You can't talk like that.
-It's late, you're gone, it's over.
-You're a jerk.
I get your little game.
What little game?
What little game? I asked you to keep
to keep an eye on her and you didn't see anything. No?
No, I didn't see anything.
Give me the keys, I'll go
to see her and have her explain to me.
It's the worst foolish thing
you can do.
That's it... try to understand her a little bit.
He wants to get out of the water.
Do you think it's easy for her?
-He was raising his daughter alone... -His daughter?
-Your daughter? -My daughter!
I give him money every month.
Look at this.
Why don't you call?
Why doesn't he call?
For God's sake!
-Hello?
-It's me.
Is it you?
-It's my mother.
-Say hello to her.
-Dov sends you a kiss.
-How nice of him!
-He was able to come in to see his daughter.
-I tried, but...
-Did you tell him about us?
-Yes.
-How did he react?
-Well, very well.
He doesn't care, that's it.
I was sure.
-So he's not angry.
-What do you think...
Listen, I can't talk.
I'll call you back.
-A kiss, Mom.
-Mommy?
-That was Mom.
-You told me.
You know what, Ivan?
You're right. You're right. I must surprise her.
I must act calmly.
I will be understanding...
...as if nothing happened.
I'll ignore her.
That's what you should do.
I'd want to know who that
that creep, just to know...
Stop it, it's not important.
Don't worry...
-calm.
-Yes, I'm calm.
I don't know what I'd do if you weren't
if you weren't here, brother.
-Hello?
-Where are you, you bastard?
-Willy! I had a little problem.
-Now you'll have...
... a big problem. Go kiss
your mother for the last time.
Listen, uh... Shit, a tunnel,
you'll never believe me.
Sergio! Don't do
the tunnel trick.
Sergio!
What were you doing here?
Patrick! Patrick!
Praise God, you're back!
-I have a big problem.
-What does it all mean?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's terrible, I'm going to die.
Yes! I'll kill you!
How could you do something like that to me?
It's not my fault.
I'm in love.
Don't move.
You lose nothing if you wait.
What do you want?
Benamu!
Benamu...
Sergio!
Where are you, Sergio?
There you are, Sergio.
Now you will give us back
our money back.
Count to five.
No, make it four.
Is that all right?
One... two...
Three... Four!
Cut! Cut!
I'll never pay you!
Gouge out my eyes,
cut off my penis.
...you won't see a penny.
You know well that I never
I never gave anything back to anyone.
It's been a long time since I
I spent his money.
I knew they were dumb,
but I didn't think they were that dumb.
Handing me bearer checks...
To me!
They really are fools.
Learn not to deal with idiots.
Listen, you fucker.
If you don't pay me, that dog's head
dog's head will be fish food.
Do you understand?
I won't leave you alone.
Until you pay me back
the money, I'll make your life miserable.
-Do you understand?
-Yes.
And you idiot... it goes for you too.
He's your cousin, isn't he?
Come on, darling.
All right, come on, Rebeca. Come on, Rebecca.
Ivan spoke to you?
-He told you that...
-Yes... yes.
-I was so afraid to tell you.
-Why?
I don't know. He's your best friend.
Precisely, I prefer
it to come from him.
-Are you sure it's okay?
-He's fine, yes.
Karina, I know I made you suffer.
That's why I have no right to
to stop you from rebuilding your life. I know that.
I'm glad to have all three of you.
All three?
Yes. Rebeca, Ivan and you.
Look at the nurse.
I don't know where he found her.
Sit down, sit down.
I warn you that if it's to
talk about Sergio, it's useless.
It doesn't exist, I don't know it.
-How are you?
-Fine, thank you.
They fell on me,
I didn't understand anything. Watch out!
Looks like they're in
a great deal.
-Ivan told me.
-I can't tell you anything.
You can't hold back.
Big deal, I don't know. Maybe it is.
I'm glad. I'm glad.
business is over.
It doesn't matter. I'm thinking of partnering
with Mamulian.
That's enough. I can't take it anymore.
-Are we done?
-Yes, we're done. We're done.
That's enough. Thank you.
This one drives me crazy.
Mamulian? What are you doing
with an Armenian?
I proposed the business and he liked it.
But when money is at stake...
I won't bother you anymore.
I'll stop by later.
Mamulian is a loser.
Don't you believe it. He set up a good business
on the Internet. He's doing well.
I did it too and I didn't
said anything. He just rode Waloo.
Why didn't you
ask me?
Be reasonable. Frankly
I would never have dared.
Besides, with all
the problems you've had.
What problems?
I took a couple of hits. That's all.
You said you were in trouble.
Only in Asia.
You know how I did on the Internet.
I made millions.
But I'm not like Mamulian,
I don't brag.
If you don't make that deal with me,
don't ever see me again. I'm serious.
It's all right.
Very good
Tell me what I do.
First, take a vacation.
Come on, little one.
Are you out of your mind?
He's coming at us!
Are you out of your mind?!
What happened?
It's unbelievable!
That guy is oblivious!
You idiot!
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, but I thought it happened.
Didn't you see there was no room?
How can you be such an idiot?
-At the port, I'll buy you a drink.
-Yes, at the port.
You jerks!
-Where do you buy them?
-Santo Domingo. It's a limited series.
-May I? -Please.
-Thank you.
Smell, my dear.
Smell it, smell it. Smell it!
I'll smoke it at home.
-Denis? -Yes?
-Can I call him Denis?
-With pleasure... - Manuel, go and get
a box of cigars...
-...the biggest model, for Denis.
-No, he's joking.
I'm glad, please.
No, it's too much.
-It's too much, I can't.
-I've got a full cellar.
-I don't know how to thank you.
-I do know, tutor me.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I love her. I'm in love with her.
It wasn't always easy for me.
It was not easy.
And I stumble upon this girl, beautiful...
...and he's looking at me like I'm
George Clooney. Can you imagine his disappointment?
You should have told him the truth.
Why did you lie to him?
If he loves you, he will accept you
just as you are.
You're right, you're right. I'll tell him everything.
"My dear, you thought me a businessman, but I'm a messenger.
businessman, but I'm a messenger."
"I'm no longer a courier, I launder
money for the mob."
"Rolls I never had, the pool doesn't exist."
"The truth is that I live with
my parents in a working class neighborhood."
"I am a great liar. When it comes
wedding, I'm very open."
Do you think it will work?
Not like that.
You don't have to tell him like that.
I didn't make you come here for that.
Here you go.
"OPEN AFTER MY DEATH"
What is this nonsense?
It's for my folks.
I wanted to give it to my cousin,
but I'm already dead to him.
Don't you think you're exaggerating?
Willy and his brother will kill me!
But why am I shouting? I'm mad.
I will be dog food.
I can't pay them back.
Charlie's a butcher.
Do you know what he did to Patrick?
-I'm lost!
-It's okay. -It's okay. Calm down. We'll find a solution.
There is no solution!
The miracle would be that someone
who claims to be my friend...
...to propose a good deal to me.
-No, that's not possible.
-Why not?
-No, that's not possible.
-Why not?
I know you're looking for a room,
I'm begging you. I swear I'll be good.
You can't ask me to do something like that.
I'm risking my skin on this.
-And I don't risk mine?
-Are you kidding?
They never gave me a hand!
My cousin always treated me
treated me like a servant.
But he never offered me a good
business, I'm only good for...
...take his bags to him.
Eddie, I swear I'll be good.
No, I can't, Sergio.
I can't.
Is this your factory?
It's in pieces!
Good heavens!
-Are they coming or what?
Sergio, the suitcases.
They annoy me...
This room is unusable.
-It's a pity, it has a magnificent view.
-Yes, to a chicken coop.
-Who is it?
-The staff.
-It's everyone who wants to work.
-All right.
Does anyone know how to use a...?
All right, I'm in. I'm hiring everyone.
Come with me.
The bricks must be cleaned and
bricks need to be cleaned and laid.
Everything that's no good,
goes in here.
-Sergio! -Yes?
-You have to connect the machines.
-I don't want it to look too new.
-I don't want it to look too new.
You know what Denis? You exasperate me.
You always do.
You'll make it too.
That's the truth.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
You didn't answer me Denis.
Are you interested in my Tunisian supplier?
No, thank you. Next year will provide us with
Vietnam will provide us, it's very promising.
Look at least at the prices.
It is very interesting.
-I'm saying it for you.
-Next year, God willing. We'll see.
-I beg your pardon?
-He means "long life.
It's unbelievable!
I'm begging you, Patrick.
Try one more week.
He doesn't want to know anything,
I've been harassing him for two weeks.
I can't stand it anymore.
Let me demolish it. A little while ago
I was about to break him...
...the stick on my head.
I don't know how I held back.
-Give us a week...
...if he doesn't bite,
I'll go back to the Market.
God keep you Eddie.
Say hello to the others.
No, I'm not running away.
But I must stay for my business.
It's more complicated than
than I thought.
We're getting married in two weeks
and you didn't even plan for catering.
I swear I'll find a solution.
Have confidence in me.
-I love you Yoyana. I love you.
-I love you too. I love you too.
¿Y?
He asked me to trust.
Then I will trust.
-Everything all right?
-I can't take care of the wedding.
-Congratulations on the wedding!
-Very kind of you.
Let's put aside personal problems.
personal problems. You too.
-Why do you say that?
-We're in the home stretch.
Go blue!
Go blue!
Patrick, there's no news.
It's not that easy with Vietnam.
I would like to meet
your contact in Tunisia.
I will see. I hope it's not
too late.
-It's nice, isn't it?
-You can't imagine how much.
A set of such quality,
that in France it costs...
...$59, the person I'll
I'll introduce you to will sell it to you for $42.
Better than in Asia.
How is this possible?
There must be a trick.
There is. But you don't have to say it
or everyone will take advantage of it...
... and goodbye business. The government
is dumping...
...wants to attract the market
the market at all costs.
-The guy plays both ways.
-Formidable.
Naturally you will get your
commission, that's logical.
Don't worry about it, Denis.
Did you understand Sergio?
You go in like a madman,...
...you start to make a fuss
and you're willing to get...
... up to 50,000 garments
to have exclusivity.
And you insist on 50,000 garments.
-Go ahead, say it again.
-I understood, I'm not stupid.
We're not in the mood.
Let's go.
-What do I hear about?
-Not me, Dov, he's the boss.
What do I find out?
Are you selling my merchandise to someone else?
I want exclusivity!
And for that I place a firm order
firm order of 10,000 garments.
-I told you 50,000.
-50,000. But I want a priority delivery.
Try to make it normal, more
calm, without doing...
Okay, I've memorized it.
Now I'll have to work on it.
-Don't you think 50,000 is a lot? -You don't?
-I know him, at that price....
... he'll sell his mother
and even turn her in.
Go ahead...
-How? What do I know?
-Calm down. - Normal.
Mr. Abderamane Buziz who runs the first
runs the first textile company.
It is an honor to welcome such a prestigious man
prestigious man in my modest company.
The modest one is you, Mr. Buziz,
you have a magnificent business.
We survived.
Come, I'll show you the plant.
Thank you.
The machines are old,
but they work.
They are very precise machines.
The meeting room.
Let's look at the logistics.
Computer room...
It must be said that we are
very present on the net.
We sell online
on request.
Since we agree on the
agree on the quality...
... let's cut to the chase.
How much will you make us for the suit?
-A set. 30,000 garments.
-Give me a second.
30 thousand garments...
45 dollars.
40 Mr. Buziz.
Denis is a friend.
40 can't be, at most
42 at the most. But no...
It's to please my friend, 40.
But be careful, I won't go any lower.
Give me that.
We made 7 million.
That's not bad.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Perfect.
Shall we sign the contracts?
Thank you.
We are relentless with deadlines...
...it's a pity that you lose the profits
earnings from late penalties.
We know how to work fast and well.
That is the secret of our success.
-What's he doing?
-He'll ruin everything, I can't believe it!
-Any problems?
-No, not at all, I'm just...
What is this?
Bunch of cretins!
Abderamane! Ah!
There you are!
Did you try to trick me?
Didn't you?
Did you want to cheat Massud?
Massud... who brought you to
Russia on a platter.
Do you want to fool me? I'll show you
what it means to cheat on an Uzbek.
Mr. Massud, these gentlemen came from France
from France to place an order.
What's this?
Give me that!
What is it?
It's my model!
Wait, I don't understand
very well.
Mr. Massud ordered this
model, but there is nothing signed.
What do you mean? We've been working together
we've been working together.
-Who are you?
-Denis Vierhuten. Purchasing Manager...
... of Eurodiscount, Europe's
hypermarket group in Europe.
I don't know him. Since that's
I want exclusivity.
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
Because you're very clever.
Wait a minute. I don't know who that is. I don't know who it is,
but he's far away.
I just placed an order
of 30,000 garments.
30,000? I'm not asking for
30 thousand, or 40 thousand...
I buy...
-300,000!
-It can't be!
Are you kidding me?
This gentleman is a joker.
Not at all!
If I say 300,000, it's 300,000!
And you owe me exclusivity.
Give me the contracts I sign.
I don't think we have
nothing to do here.
-Calm down.
-This is anything.
What are you doing?
We said 50,000.
We're not spending the night here.
night, give me the order.
You'll ruin everything.
-I told Eddie
not to come in. -I told Eddie not to come in.
-350,000!
-Mr. Vierhuten!
We will sell to our Belgian and
Belgian and German subsidiaries.
-We'll make a lot of money on the difference.
-But this guy is crazy!
-He's not crazy, he's Uzbek.
-380 thousand! -Who are they?
-They won't make the rules.
-If you speak again, I'll kill you.
380,000! That's the last of it!
Tell me I'll sign!
How much for 400,000?
27. All right.
It's a deal.
If you follow me,
we change contracts.
Not that door.
No, no, not that door.
We'd better go to my office.
There's champagne.
The price indicated is FOB.
at the airport against delivery.
-Here it is like this.
-After the quality contract,...
-... in France it's like this.
-At the airport.
Of course I will. I will give instructions
to our Bank.
I'll give the order as soon as the
goods are checked...
...and be satisfied.
Bring me the cigars.
You impress me. You
I knew you were bold, but this...
Don't you understand? At that price
it's the deal of the century.
We will flood Europe.
-For cosmetic billing.
-I'm sorry?
My personal commission.
My Hong Kong Account,
with total discretion, of course.
We are used to it.
-Do you have the documents?
-Yes.
-Calm down. - Sorry? -No, nothing.
-No, nothing.
-Here, this corresponds to this... -Yeah, okay.
-Yes, it's fine.
Any problems?
-¿Y?
-It didn't happen.
The controller took everything apart.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
-It was because of this idiot.
-He discovered the trap, that's it.
"Dear Sir, I confirm
the transfer to your account..."
"...No. 0045..., in the amount of..."
"...65,740,000 Francs."
-How many dollars?
-A lot!
-Is it true?
-No, I want to apologize first.
Sergio, I love you.
Say, "I'm proud to have a cousin like you.
to have a cousin like you."
I'm proud to have
a cousin like you.
So handsome, so cool
and so smart.
-Go to hell.
-We have to catch a plane.
-What is he doing here?
-He's the delivery man.
-Do you deliver now?
-Provisionally.
Where is the merchandise?
It's all here, sir.
There are not 400,000 garments here!
Something is wrong.
-Where is the rest?
-There is no rest.
Corresponds exactly
to the bill of lading.
What stupidity is this?
Open up!
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
I don't know, I don't understand.
It looks like doll clothes.
The control!
It is indicated: 50 long,
25 wide.
Millimeters.
Vierhuten, if you ever have
a size problem, give me a call.
We manufacture very fast
in Le Sentier.
-Sir...
-It's not centimeters.
It's millimeters.
They fooled us like
amateurs.
We were fooled like rookies!
We were fooled like rookies!
-Ka... Dov?
-Ivan!
How are you?
-Who is it, dear?
-It's Ivan.
I am the happiest man.
-Hello! -Hello!
-Hello!
Go get dressed or you'll give us
you'll give us a heart attack.
-Here.
-Thank you.
They are beautiful.
Come, sit down.
It was explosive. We made love
like animals, you can't imagine.
I prefer not to know.
I followed your advice
and everything went well.
What about that guy...?
Are you out of your mind?
We didn't even mention it.
I think he made it up
to make me jealous.
Women are evil.
Karina!
Look how beautiful she is!
I was telling him how great
he was with us.
Ivan, I'll never forget what
you did for us.
Me neither.
For love.
-To love.
-And to friendship.
Not a single call in 15 days!
No news. Not even her
parents don't know where he is.
What a disgrace, my dear!
He'll never come back!
Dad!
I know how you feel, my dear.
It's fortunate that
we've discovered...
...his real face today.
Imagine if they got married!
In any case
he won't go to Paradise.
Here I am!
Maurizio! Yoyana!
Come and see!
My love!
He's downstairs! I told you!
-I love you Yoyana!
-I love you, my love!

 tenacious we know,...
... is first and foremost..,
a man of the heart.
A generous man...
... that makes the joy of
of your community...

No way!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's the chef doing?
Go get it.
I can't take it anymore!
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go,
Run for it!
Hello, take advantage,
There's a buffet!
It's killing me
my nerves.
It kills my nerves!
Relax, Sergio.
You'll have depression!
Put one salmon per sausage,
it's eating my house.
Did you see what a beauty?
Isn't this a beauty too?
She's the woman of my life.
Peter Allawi, just like
as his cousin.
Go and say hello! Over there!
Congratulations, my dear.
Just like your mother when she was
young. I adore you, my dear.
I always knew that
my son would succeed.
His son told me that
he was a golf champion.
-What? -No, not at all...
Ah, golf... I play golf.
Of course you do!
I started playing recently.
What is your handicap?
3 from the right eye
and 5 from the left eye.
What a nice party...
He almost made me cry
that creep.
How are you?
-Frankly. -Are we not well?
-Like kings. - Great, folks.
Just something worries me.
-What if they control taxes?
-We get life imprisonment.
Sergio, we need to talk to you.
-What's the matter?
-Martina...
-This Martina.
-What Martina?
-If Yoyana knows, you're dead.
-I didn't invite her.
I never invited Martina!
Watch out!
Shit! My watch!
They don't respect anything!
Don't get exasperated!
