Ladies and gentlemen, we're now approaching
another great symbol of Istanbul.
One of the most famous places
of Turkey: the Bosphorus Bridge
connecting Europe and Asia.
In the last 2000 years, many nations
wanted to control this special place
that was useful for transportation
between Europe and the Middle East.
This bridge was opened in 1973,
and as you will be able to see
it's always full of traffic.
If you look further down,
you will be able to see
the Sultan Mohamed Bridge
that was opened in 1988,
after the city expanded even more.
Please be careful when you leave the boat,
and take all your belongings with you.
When in Oskada, walk along the common walk
and eat some of the fish
our local fishermen cleaned and grilled.
- Dad, look!
- Nair, let me see the balloon.
I don't want it to go loose.
Nair wait, let dad tie it up.
- Are you enjoying yourself, dear?
- Yes, a lot.
- Did you see something you like?
- Excuse me.
Hassan! Hassan! What's wrong?
Help! Somebody help me please!
Help! Help!
- Help please! Please help!
- What happened?
- Don't worry, it will be alright.
- Hassan, my love!
Here he comes.
Shalom everybody!
Well done, Eyal. Excellent job.
- Thanks. - Champagne anyone?
Let's have a drink. - A real
celebrity. Give yourself a blowjob.
MASTER OF TERROR TERMINATED
Not only in Israel...
"The brain of the Hamas attacks was killed".
Are you okay? - Yes.
You speak to Iris? - Yesterday.
And? - She sounds okay. - Strange.
She's not answering my calls.
Quiet, please. Cheers!
Cheers!
- Wait a minute!
Shouldn't we say something?
Well...
to Eyal who loves his profession.
Great job.
Anything to add, Menachem?
- Very funny. I won't say anything.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Iris?
Iris, are you asleep?
Iris?
"Eyal"
Menachem...
Fire at will...
You're in good shape.
Thanks.
- How are you doing?
What do you mean? - Nothing
special. I'm glad you're okay.
Menachem asked
if you could stop by his office.
Good to see you.
You can't disappear like that.
Resting? Having fun? - The usual.
We're starting a new operation, right?
You didn't go to the psychologist.
I won't go. Iris had therapy forever.
I'm afraid they'll ground you.
You know the regulations.
Fuck regulations. How is this
related? - How is this related?
It was traumatic so till you see
one... - I can't believe this shit.
Don't be so aggressive. I'm trying
to help you. - Go ahead, help me.
Remember Alfred Himmelmann?
- The Nazi you wanted to find?
You can put it that way.
- He's half-dead. Who cares? - I do.
He wiped out all the Jews
from an entire area of Germany.
Hardly anyone survived except me,
your mother and a few others.
Himmelmann lived in Argentina
all these years.
Some dirty deal with the government
protected him.
Two months ago he disappeared.
We don't know where to.
What did you have in mind?
- Himmelmann has a son in Germany,
whom we always kept an eye on.
He's not a child himself,
has two adult children.
The daughter met an Israeli
and moved to a Kibbutz.
And a son in Berlin.
How do I fit in? - The son
is coming to visit his sister.
She's worried
about all the suicide bombers.
So she called a travel agency
to hire a tour guide and I thought...
What? Take him
to the Holocaust museum?
I think if you get close to them,
we'll learn about the grandfather.
And I need someone who speaks German.
- Menachem, let's be honest here.
No one gives a damn anymore.
He'll die by himself soon enough.
I want to get him before God does.
Hello?
Where?
Rishon - Le Zion?
Shit! How many killed?
Call Yaakov! What do you mean
no answer? Call again!
Menachem! He hasn't come through yet.
So dial again. - I heard about it.
- Galit! - Menachem!
Shit, cell phones are dead.
Every time a bomb goes off...
Never mind,
they'll come back soon. Fuck them!
Twelve people killed.
Hi. I'm Axel. This is my name here.
Mr. Himmelmann, welcome to Israel.
- Just missed the day's bomb.
- What?
- We've just had a bomb. A terrorist
that blew himself up. - Where?
Not far. Rishon Letzion.
It's a city close to here.
- Very close?
- Yes, but don't be afraid.
They never do more than
one a day. I mean, usually.
But maybe for you
they will have a second one today.
I am joking.
Okay.
Shit.
- What?
- This music.
They play sad music after a bomb.
Let's listen to good music.
Okay... I have got "The Doors"
The first album, "Morrison Hotel",
some Dylans, Tom Waits,
and of course "The Boss".
- Do you like Springsteen?
- Yeah.
Why not?
Pia! Pia!
Come here.
Carefully.
Come here...
- Hello!!
- Careful, I will wet you.
You must be Eyal!
- Yes. Hello!
- Pia!
- I figured.
- Thank you.
- I just picked him up. He was scared
- when he heard about the bomb.
- You speak too fast!
Little Hebrew... but I am learn...
Great.
- Let's go. Are you hungry?
- Yes.
He is the secretary.
He administers my kibbutz.
- That's my brother Axel.
- Hello. - Hello.
- So, you do like the kibbutz food?
- Yes, I like it very much. Thank you.
- The fish is very good.
- It's from here. Your sister? - Yes.
Very nice, your sister. I told her
if I not marry, I marry her.
Bye.
- We've got "ricudyam" tonight.
- Oh, good for you.
- What is "ricuim"?
- Ricudyam. It's a Jewish dance.
- That's fun.
- Do you know these dances?
Well, I know enough about them.
That's why I think I'm gonna leave you, guys.
- See you tomorrow.
- Oh no, please stay with us.
Yes, please.
Turn around.
Another time.
Come on.
Turn around.
- You disappeared.
- No, I had to get some fresh air.
This is so much fun. You're lucky
to live here, you can do it every week.
I must remember the steps
to teach them to my children.
- And maybe you can dance with my sister.
- No.
No, we are not allowed to dance
with customers on the first night.
Sorry.
That was very good.
It's always good. Apart from dancing
there isn't much to do here.
This is not Berlin.
Refrigerator, closet, seat,
table,
- window, door.
- Very good.
And with whom
do you usually dance?
With everyone.
Don't you have a boyfriend? Friends?
No.
How about our guide?
He seems strong.
He would do great
repairs in the house for sure.
My last boyfriend was like him.
And what happened?
Yes, sometimes it's a little difficult,
but people here are usually nice.
Only they ask me if somebody
of the family was a Nazi
The curious thing is that when I say yes,
they give me a pitiful look.
but nobody insults my family.
As I say: people will always return
to you what you give to them.
And that's a mistake, brother.
You are very naive.
How so?
Because when my boyfriend found out
the truth about our family it was the end.
It was over. At first he said
that it wasn't a problem,
that he didn't hate Germans, but since
I told him it could not get out of his head.
He could no longer stay with me.
Do you want milk and sugar?
I remember: some milk and
a clod of sugar.
Yes you remember.
Axel, what did you really come for?
Don't you want to see dad and mom?
They miss you.
- Mom wanted me to ask you...
- I know.
You can call them and tell them that
you have failed. That I won't return.
- Wait please.
- What do you want from me?
I am fine here.
The place is comfortable.
This place is fantastic, but
why not speak with them or visit them?
- And why did you leave home?
- But I live in Berlin.
And how often do you see them?
Every 4 months?
It's not the same thing. We talk
on the phone, we are in touch.
I don't want to stay in touch.
You can't understand.
They know that I don't want
anything from them.
Alright, alright.
Come on, let's not fight.
I only came to stay with you.
And so Hansel and Gretel
kept fighting.
Very dramatic. What do you say?
You're wrong. There's something
there. You have to keep pushing.
- Stay focused.
- I am focused. What do you want?
What's going on?
- That's my question.
We're finished soon
and I'll be back. Right, Menachem?
When do we start training?
- No rush. Carry on with this.
I'll come back. - Something you're
hiding from me? No problem. I'll go.
Relax.
- Good morning to you.
- Good morning.
Why don't you join us?
Well...
Maybe I can use an egg.
So, where are you going?
- Oh, you're not coming with us?
- No, I really have to work.
I'll join you at the weekend.
- Do you have a nice plan for today?
- Well, we have many options,
we could see Christian holy places,
or the places mentioned in the Bible.
- All that Axel wants.
- There are so many places I want to see.
Haifa is beautiful, isn't it? And I also
want to see the sea of Galilee, "Kinerat".
Kineret?
You seem to know
the country pretty well.
I've always been interested in Israel.
I also want to see the Palestinian cities.
- Could we go to them as well today?
- It's the other direction.
- Anyway, why do you want to go there?
- Why not?
I brought a few of my CDs.
You're my guest.
Let's me see what else
you've got here.
Many women singers.
- Only women.
- Why?
I like female singers, when a man sings,
I always feel like there's something missing.
Really? That's strange.
- Who is this?
- Gigliola Cinquetti. She's Italian.
Fits in perfectly with
the scenery, don't you think?
- So, how many children do you have?
- I don't have any children.
But you said something about
teaching your children to dance.
No. I meant the children that I teach.
I work for this Organisation.
We help children of immigrants,
you know, from Turkey and other places.
We help them with their
homework. We read with them.
There's not much
money in that kind of work.
- My God, you just sound like my parents
- Why? What do they think?
- My father owns this big factory,
and wants me to work there. - I see.
He's always expected us
to join the family business.
But then Pia left, and I just told them I'd
rather do something useful with my life.
Tell more about your family?
Well, there's not so much to tell.
It's only my parents and Pia.
- No grandparents?
- No.
They died a long time ago.
- Do you have any?
- What, grandparents?
No. Actually even my mother
died a few years ago. And my father.
- Well, he died when I was in high school.
- I see.
- Do you have children?
- No. And I'm not going to have any.
- Why not? - Forget it. You might have
to hear my pessimistic view of the world.
Hi Pia...
No, we are already
in the North. Why?
I see. Do you want
to talk to him?
Okay. Okay, bye.
They had a bomb in Haifa.
- Very close to where we passed.
- What happened?
Another of those fucking terrorists
exploded. Four people died.
Shit, that's terrible.
Did you ever think why these
people are doing this? I mean...
how desperate they must be
to go there and kill themselves?
What's to think? They're enemies.
There is a lot to think.
They have mothers and children.
So why do they come and kill
innocent mothers and children here?
There's nothing to think about.
He says his grandfather is dead. I'm
stuck with this pseudo liberal who
talks about suicide bombers' motives.
I almost punched him. - Calm down.
What did he say about
his grandfather?
- He doesn't have one.
- Find out more.
Maybe he doesn't know. Maybe...
Maybe he thinks he's Dolly
the clone-sheep and never had one.
Stop acting like a child.
Maybe you do need a therapist.
I don't need to host
a patronizing German peacenik
for the Foreign Ministry.
Why are you getting so uptight?
It's not like you.
Relax, have some fun.
And if you happen to
learn something...
Whatever. I've got to go now.
- Call me later.
The Kineret.
So, this is where all happened.
Hey, Jesus, they lied to you!
It's impossible to walk on water.
Bravo, you did it.
You don't understand, you can't
just come to the Sea of Galilee
and start walking on water.
If you could,
everybody would be doing it.
- You need to prepare yourself.
- And how would you do that?
- Please, enlighten me.
- Well...
You need to completely purify yourself.
Your heart is to be like
it's clean from the inside.
No negativity,
no bad thoughts.
- And then?
- And then you can walk on water.
I am sure of it.
"Talent show"
- Where did you go?
- I just went to get something. - What?
- We got to do "Cinderella Rockefella".
- Oh, you must be crazy!
- Why not?
- What are you talking about?
- My little brother's drunk.
- I didn't drink anything.
- Do you remember the song "Cinderella
Rockefella"? - Cinderella who?
Do you remember Esther Ofarim?
Yes, I know the name, but
what do you know about her?
She and her husband, the Ofarim,
they were huge in Germany in the 60's.
Yes. My crazy aunt
was a great fan of her.
She taught us "Cinderella Rockefella"
Axel and I used to sing it
at family parties.
We used to get dressed up
as prince and princess.
Thanks! Thanks a lot!
Thank you, Tom.
And now we have a surprise.
Our Pia and her brother Axel.
# You're the lady,
you're the lady that I love
# I'm the lady, the lady who
# You're the lady,
you're the lady that I love
# I'm the lady, the lady who
# - You're the little lady
- I'm the little lady, ooh
# - I love your touch.
- Thank you so much.
# - I love your eyes.
- Mmh that's very nice.
# - I love your chin
- Say it again
# I love your chiny chin chin
# - You're the fella, you're the fella who rocks me
- Rockefella, Rockefella,
# - You're the fella, you're the fella who rocks me
- Rockefella, Rockefella,
# - You're my Rockefella,
- I am your Rockefella
- Right first...
- No, the left leg first.
You dance well, let's go to Berlin
and repeat it for dad's birthday
Don't talk nonsense.
They said something about a party,
but with no details.
Forget it, Menachem.
They'll be here any minute.
I'm taking him to the Dead Sea.
Via the Jordan valley.
During the day it's safe,
don't worry.
I'll show him Jericho.
He wants to see Palestinians.
He's such a nudnik.
I won't stop in Jericho, don't worry.
I might drown him in the Dead Sea.
Might be a world news scoop.
Okay, Menachem.
They're here, I gotta go. Bye!
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Make sure my brother
puts on some suntan lotion.
You know, he gets sunburnt really fast.
Two hours in the desert
he'll be red like a tomato.
No problem,
it's part of the service.
- So tell me, does she like to live here?
- Yes, she loves it.
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- She had one, but not anymore.
A guy she met in India.
She says Israeli men are...
- What, impossible?
- Yes. I mean... no.
It's okay. She's not
the first who thinks so.
Is it true that Israeli men
don't like to talk about their feelings?
I don't know.
I really don't like to talk about it.
So, are you in a relationship?
I am not so great
at relationships, I think.
Do you know anyone
who's good at relationships?
I guess you're right.
How can you ever know
what a woman is really thinking?
They always complain that you never listen,
you're not connected to your emotions,
you never cry.
You just never know when they're serious.
When they really mean it.
What do you mean?
For many years I was
involved with a woman, Iris.
That's it. Now I'm on my own.
Come on. Let's take this stuff off.
- Jalla. - Jalla?
- It's an Hebraic word.
It means "come on".
You don't have to walk on water here.
You can float in them instead.
- You really never cry?
- Never.
Not even when you see a sad movie,
or you hear a sad song?
It's okay, I have a good excuse.
When I was 15, the doctors discovered
I have a rare eye-problem.
My tear ducts are dry
So I cant cry even if I want to.
- Shit. Your sister's going to kill me.
- What?
You're really burnt.
Okay. Put some on your arms.
I'll do your back.
So they didn't you circumcise you?
I've never see one.
You know, we used
to talk about in the army.
if it looks bigger,
and if it's better in bed.
I don't know. It's the only one
I've ever had.
Is everybody like that in Europe?
In Germany hardly nobody's
circumcised, except for the Turks.
In other countries
of Europe, let me think...
Italians... definitely not circumcised.
Also the English and the French,
definitely not.
Actually only the Muslims are circumcised
in Europe, and the Jews, of course.
I think it looks better circumcised.
I see you know quite a lot about it.
Thank you.
It's freezing cold here.
No, don't move away.
The only way to keep warm
is to sit close to each other.
Every Israeli soldier knows this.
- So, how often does your sister
come to visit you? - She doesn't.
- Why not?
- She doesn't get along with my parents.
I actually came here to try to bring her
back to my father's birthday party.
- Birthday party?
- Yes, my father's going to be 70,
we're organizing a party for him.
My mother thought it would be
a wonderful surprise if Pia came.
It sounds nice.
Yes, it's going to be a big thing,
with lots of guests.
You know, my parents live
in this Villa, next to Vansi.
Thats where the party's going to be.
But Pia, she doesn't
even want to talk about it.
- Can I ask you something personal?
- Of course.
I've got nothing to hide. Go ahead.
I've always wondered what it was like
to grow up in Germany
and then suddenly realise
what happened in world war two.
Well, that's not such an easy one.
Was your family in the...?
- You're changing the subject.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
To tell you the truth,
it's something we almost never talk about.
My friends, they feel like
it's something from the past.
They feel like it's something
we don't have anything to do with.
- We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to. - No.
It actually feels right to talk
about it, especially in Israel.
It's just that... Whenever
I try to talk about it, I...
I don't know. I never find the
right words. I feel...
I don't know...
Stupid?
- This is an interesting way to put out
the campfire. - It is the best way.
They teach it to you in the Boys Scouts.
I told you, you haven't been
drinking enough water.
You don't listen.
That was beautiful. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Listen, that's an Israeli
female singer for you.
- What's the song about?
- It's a love song, you know...
But what are the words?
Can you translate?
Yes, I can try.
"The two of us are riding in a car,
you tell me it will be a long ride,
"that I can't fall asleep.
"later you tell me
everything that happen.
"I'm not sleeping.
"I'm counting stars
through holes in the blanket.
"And you, with your cigarette in your mouth
"singing along with the radio
"a love song.
"Kiss me strong,
"kiss me till it hurts."
That's it, more or less.
It goes on like that.
Fire at will...
Shit!
What's up? You're working hard, eh?
Too many female singers.
- What?
Nothing. I'm just...
You're not... Do you have to report
this? Could you just...
It's okay. There's nothing wrong.
It's not that bad. Go home.
Have a nice weekend.
Rest. Don't worry.
- Look, it's a problem.
The guy's in complete denial.
He's been through a trauma.
It might be risky to send him
on such a complicated job.
Are you saying that
just so you can keep him?
I'll be done with him in 2 days.
It's fine with me. You know what?
Check his results
from today's practice.
I bet he wasn't good.
- I don't know.
I can't give him up. He did a terrific
job with Abu-Ibrahim. I need him.
I can insist he sees Rudy.
I'll convince him he's not just
any shrink, but the chief counsellor.
Am I interrupting? - No. Just asking
when you'll be done with this bullshit.
Just a couple of days more.
Menachem, we need to talk.
Just a second.
Let me finish with Gello. Take this.
Check the extra material
on Himmelmann.
Extra material? I told you
he's dead. What do you want?
Sorry.
Too much desert.
I'll be sitting outside, reading.
Take your time.
- You look different today.
- Different? - Yes.
I don't know, your hair looks...
You said we're going to a fancy
restaurant in Tel Aviv, so I put on some...
lipstick.
- It's nice.
- Thank you.
Can I offer you a dessert?
We have hot chocolate soufflé with ice-cream
- We have crème brûlé... - Maybe we should
wait till my brother comes back.
Okay. I'll give you a few minutes.
Is very friendly, your brother.
Yes, he is.
I have the address
to the best party in town.
It's a place called "T. L. V.".
Don't look at me. I know
nothing about these things.
I mean, nothing.
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- Yes, looks great, doesn't it?
- Do you want to drink?
- Yes. - Beer, please.
- What can I get you, sweetie?
- Sweetie?
- Okay then, not sweetie.
- Three Heinekens.
I'll be right back.
- Thanks. Let's go dance.
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?
- You go dance. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- I'm going.
- Why? - I just have to go.
I'll pick you up
tomorrow at the Hotel.
Morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, I'm okay.
Good morning. Is it okay if Rafik
takes a ride with us to Jerusalem?
- He lives in... What's the place called?
- "Bah Jala" - "Bah Jala"
An Arab?
Whatever. You'll pay.
This is where the borders used to be
until we took over East Jerusalem in '67.
Arab snipers were sitting
on top of these walls.
If they had a bad day they would
shoot the Jews walking on the other side.
I think we should get off here.
- Can you please let us off?
- Why?
Rafik is take me
to his uncle's shop.
This is the wall.
The viewer like to put a note there.
- The religious believe God reads them.
- You have no reason to be upset.
It doesn't matter anymore,
the main thing is that he found
someone to take him shopping. I mean,
isn't that why you come to Israel?
It's so strange.
He always liked to flaunt it.
Bach in high school, in front
of our parents' friends
it was always the first thing
that he would say: "Ich bin Schwul"
- Which is "I'm gay" in German.
- Well, he didn't say that to me.
Neither did you,
but truly doesn't matter anymore.
Maybe you frightened him?
Maybe you said something that...
- Oh, so now it's my fault?
- It is not a question of fault.
I really don't want to talk about it.
Let's talk about you, okay?
Why aren't you going home
to your father's birthday party?
- He told to you about that?
- Is it a secret?
- It's not, I just don't want to go.
- Why not?
I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to see them again.
- But they are your parents...
- Are you taking sides on this now?
This is the women's section.
Do you want to put a note?
Oh yes, Axel.
Look at this. I wanted one for years.
- How much did you pay for it?
- 100 Euro. 100 Euro?
- Rafik had him to lower the price.
- Give me the jacket.
- What is it?
- Tell me what you want, I will speak to him.
- Stay out of this!
- Eyal, what are you doing?
- Let me handle this okay?
- No, but it is alright.
He would have paid twice as much in Berlin.
What? He is happy.
He doesn't feel like he's been ripped off.
Stay out of this, okay?
Give back the money!
100? You should be ashamed.
You won't get a better price. I promise.
- Sorry sir.
- It doesn't matter.
It's enough. Great.
Here. 100. Take back 20.
You get it for 80.
You're trying to cheat?
Give me the money.
20, 40, 60, 80...
That's it.
Only 20? What are you thinking?
- You didn't have to do that.
- Why not?
- I told you, that's a good price for Axel.
- So what?
- So? It wasn't too much money for me.
I feel so bad for the shopkeepers.
The poor Palestinian shopkeepers...
I forgot you Germans
are so sensitive.
Human misery
always touches your hearts.
- What did you say?
- Nothing. Forget it.
I will go now.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's not your fault.
It was nice to meet you. Take care.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- Let's stay in touch.
- We will.
Can I say one sentence?
- Go ahead.
You Jews are so obsessed with
what was done to you in the past.
- Maybe if you let go, you'd be able to
see... - That's already 3 sentences.
- Okay. Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.
This is all that's left
of a full public bus
after another
suicide bomber blew himself up.
The terrorist, driving a 4X4 SUV,
stopped behind the bus
while it was picking up
passengers at this station...
- The atmosphere is very tense.
- Yes.
Have you ever thought
of going home for a visit?
And destroy our future?
They are our parents.
You don't know anything
about our parents.
Tell me then.
I don't want to,
I promised not to return.
If I there's something I should know,
you're the one who you should tell me.
You have no idea?
All the time that out father spent
locked up in his room?
And all the calls abroad
in the middle of the night?
What do you mean?
All those calls...
I picked up the telephone
once by mistake, and I found out
that our famous grandfather is still alive.
That they telephoned him
all those years, and that he cannot move.
- Is he still alive?
- He was alive when I left.
I don't believe it. They told us
he died at the end of the war.
They said many things.
I got so angry. I screamed and
insisted that he had to go to prison.
Do you think
that he is still alive?
I don't know.
I left the house on that same day.
Dad was afraid I would go
to the police. It was terrible.
I don't understand.
Why didn't you tell me that?
You had left to Italy.
You were in love for the first time.
I didn't want to bother you.
But I returned after some weeks.
I know.
Sorry.
I could not live there knowing that.
Let's stay in touch.
We have to get going.
Well, you've my phone number.
If you're in the area sometimes...
Okay. Thanks.
It's 102 FM Radio Tel Aviv,
and as usual we play you soft music
after a suicide bombing.
"Have a good day,
a calm day"
Thank you so much for everything.
I had a very interesting vacation.
My pleasure.
This is my address in Berlin. You're more
than welcome if you're ever around.
Thank you. But to tell you the truth,
I've never been to Germany,
and I don't think I'll ever want to go.
Well, if you change your mind.
You tell him.
I feel wrong about it, anyway.
No problem. It should come from me.
I'll keep him busy with Himmelmann.
How long will this Nazi shit continue?
Isn't this thing getting too expensive?
Don't worry, I talked to the boss.
Your ass is covered, I...
Hello, Eyal. Did he catch his plane?
Yes, he's gone.
Could've told me he's homo.
Why does it matter?
- Did you spend two weeks with him?
A real homo-homo?
- No, a half-homo.
Did he have wandering hands?
He try to touch you?
I take it you really had fun.
- I'm not amused at all.
Here's your last disc. I didn't even
listen to it. I'm done with this.
I'm ready for the new operation.
Okay, I'll leave you alone.
I can't believe
you got me mixed up with this crap.
Touring around with...
I mean, I've got nothing against him,
but everyone's started training.
I missed three days already.
Listen! They decided you're not...
I told you... I warned you.
What? - I'm sorry. I tried. I told them
you were really good with the Germans.
That you are in great shape.
- Fuck! Those mother!
Who do they think they are?
I started this mission
and I'm supposed to finish it!
What other agent
would do such a clean job?
I... Forget it.
- Don't take it so bad.
There will be other operations...
- I've had enough of you!
Enough of you
and of your stupid Nazi games!
Hello.
- Hello.
Menachem asked me to deliver this.
He wants you to listen to this.
- Thanks, I...
Do you need it back?
- No.
I... If I'm not needed I'll just
leave. - Thanks.
I picked up the telephone once
by mistake, and I found out
that our famous grandfather is still alive.
That they telephoned him
all those years, and he cannot move.
- Is he still alive?
- He was alive when I left.
I don't believe it. They told us
he died at the end of the war.

I got so angry. I screamed and
insisted that he had to go to prison.
Do you think that he is still alive?
I don't know.
Dad was afraid I would go
to the police. It was terrible.
Good morning.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Hello, it's going to be a nice day.
and to have a lucky day,
we're going to listen
to Buffalo Springfield...
What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
Well, you did.
Thank you. I really love hot dogs.
This is not a hot dog.
This is a curry wurst.
- Curry wurst?
- Curry wurst.
- It's very nice here in Berlin.
- Well, what did you expect?
I don't know.
The truth is I was...
I was afraid you wouldn't
be happy to see me.
No, you don't understand.
How can I explain to you...
I was in a very delicate situation
when you came to Israel.
Delicate?
- Do you remember I told you about Iris?
- Your girlfriend?
Well, the truth is she was my wife.
We were married for a few years and
about a month. Before you came to Israel
she suddenly...
She left and...
We don't have tourists now,
and there's not much work, so I..
You see, after you left
I really felt that...
I didn't want you
to think that just because...
You know...
So I bought the ticket and...
It's okay.
Eat your curry wurst.
It will get cold.
Before I forget...
I don't believe it. Folk dancing.
Thank you. That's very nice.
You have no idea how nice.
Do you know how humiliating it was
to walk into "Tower Records"
and ask for this music?
You should have seen
the guy there, how he looked at me.
Excuse me.
- Can I have two beers please?
- What kind of beer?
- You have "Heineken"?
- Sure.
Where are you from?
Israel.
- Something to eat?
- No thanks.
We just gorged on "curry wurst. "
Oh, gourmets!
Well, maybe he doesn't like
Israel, but I think he likes you.
Really? I wouldn't know.
I'm not into German guys.
- What do you mean?
- I've never been with a German guy.
- What?
- I've been with Italians, English, French
Turks and a Palestinian,
but never with a German guy.
Do you have any idea why?
Not really. It just
went on that way.
I guess it's less complicated.
I always thought you people were more...
easy going about these matters.
- Who? Germans?
- No.
- You know...
- Homos?
Yes. I thought it's more easy. Like
with the Arab. You met and right away.
Rafik? I am not sure
that's true in his case, but.. Yes,
sometimes it's very fast.
- Why? Are you jealous?
- No.
- It could be fun some time, is it not?
- What?
Being able to see
someone you like and just...
go straight to bed,
not having to talk much.
Yeah, that can be nice.
And when that happens...
How does it work out? I mean..
How do you know?
You straight men..
- What?
- You are all the same.
The only thing you wanna know is
who does the schnukie schnukie.
Not really.
No, I mean...
Well, it's interesting.
You, for example.
What do you...
If you really need to know,
I like it both ways.
After all, how many options are there?
Would be stupid to limit yourself.
But...
- Doesn't it hurt?
- No, not really.
You have to relax the Tuschie,
and then it can feel pretty good,
the feeling of someone
entering your body,
the feeling of...
Maybe that's enough
for the first time, no?
So how is your Arab friend?
Much better,
after I sent him other 100 Euro
to give his uncle for that stupid jacket.
Axel! What a surprise!
And who do we have here?
- I want to try him.
- He's wonderful.
He is an Israeli friend.
How do you do?
How was the party in "Roses"?
Good as always.
Now I need to drink seriously.
Sometimes I also need
someone to hold my hand.
Behave yourself.
See you later.
- They thought you were cute.
- Oh, should I be flattered?
Don't get upset, they're really okay.
Some of them even
volunteer in our Organisation.
You don't need to patronize.
I remember we're at that International
# Long live the diva!
Long live Victoria... #
Are you okay?
Eyal..
Leave before I blow up your head.
- You speak German?
- Not really.
- But you just spoke perfectly.
- My parents spoke German.
- What?
- My mother was born in Berlin.
She lived here until
they had to roll at night
That's how I grew up,
no German products in the house,
no travelling to Germany,
never talking about it.
When they were alone and didn't think
I was listening, they'd speak German.
It that why you brought the gun?
I don't know, just before I left
for the airport I got scared.
I didn't really think. I just took it.
- It's too bad you didn't kill him.
- What?
It's too bad you didn't kill that shit.
Those people pollute the world.
They turn everything into shit.
You know what?
As long as you're here, why don't you
come to my parents' kibbutz?
- Their what?
- Their villa. I told you about it. Remember?
My father's birthday party is
this weekend.
Come instead of Pia.
I'll be happy to.
You know, I almost bought you this CD.
I bought it at the airport
on my way home.
- I bought so many Hebrew CDs.
- Only female singers, I hope.
Let's stop here for a coffee.
Thank you.
That was the first highway in Germany.
In the 20s there were car races here.
Do you see those seats over there?
That's were all the important people
would sit and watch the races,
- all the politicians, the aristocrats.
- And then, Hitler and his people.
Yes, he was sitting there too.
You know, when we were in high school,
a group of students went to Germany
as part of an exchange program
so there were
all kinds of stories about
how the German girls
were easy and you know...
But there was one thing
I couldn't get out of my head.
My friends took it out that anyone
they saw who was over 60 years old
was a grown up during the war
and probably participated in it.
so they made up this game where
they walked up to all the people the street
and asked them in Hebrew: where were you
when my family was burned at the camps?
And they started
laughing and... You know...
Do you want to play this game here?
It did pass my mind, but I figure that
only people over 80, 85
could have been in the Army then.
- Very few are still alive.
- Don't be a sissy! Give it a try!
How old would you say this man is?
- What is it?
- You won't believe this...
but I know this man.
He is a friend of my parents.
Incredible.
Hello. - Hello.
- What are you doing here?
- Watching over you. - I don't understand.
- Calm down. Introduce me, then I'll go.
I'm staying here. Room 223.
That's Menachem, a friend
of my mother's. This is Axel.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
It's always nice to run into
somebody you know, just like this.
Will you join us?
No thank you, I'm on my way.
I just needed a sandwich.
Well it was nice bumping into you.
Bye.
It's a small world, isn't it?
Yes. This always happens to me.
This is an Esther Ofarim
that I really like.
I guess I don't have to translate, huh?
Here it is.
Axel, nice to have you here.
Hi!
- Come on, give me that.
You also.
- It's okay.
- Give it to her. There's no way out.
This is Egla, she took care of me
since I was a little boy.
- Egla, this is Eyal.
- Welcome.
I hope you take good a very
good care of our Axel.
Someone's got to do it.
Come to the kitchen, later.
I made the cheese tarts.
Come, let's say hello to my mother.
- Mother!
- Axel.
- Dear.
- This is my mother.
- Nice to meet you. I am Sigrid.
- I am Eyal, nice to meet you too.
- Eyal, that's...
- It's an Israeli name.
Oh I see, that's nice.
So you live here?
No, it's my first time to Germany.
Welcome, then.
I hope you'll have a good time.
Excuse me...
There's so much to do.
Axel, please be on time tonight, at 8.
8 o' clock.
- You look...
- What?
Very German.
Thank you. You look good, too.
- Do you think that this jacket
is good enough? - Sure, come on.
- It's good to see you, son.
- For me too, father.
Where's your sister?
She could not come.
She's left for that miserable kibbutz..
Let's not speak about that now.
It's your birthday dad.
This is my friend, Eyal.
How do you do.
Axel, it's great to see you.
Hello.
Did you do something
special for your father?
Of course, uncle Gustav.
Attention, please.
I thought a lot about what to do today,
for my father's 70th birthday,
something which would cheer us up,
and I decided to teach
to you a little dance I learned.
I promise it will be easy,
and you'll enjoy it a lot.
Let's make a circle,
then follow my movements,
it will be very easy.
Come. Aunt Frida will stay here...
- Aren't you going to dance?
- I have to do something.
We'll start with the right leg...
...right, left, then we stop.
Then another time, right, left, then turn.
Right, left, right and then we turn.
Inward, outward then we stop.
Turn around.
And turn around again.
A step right
and back,
Okay, let's start again.
I insist. Come on.
Once again.
Turn around
Turn around again.
And, attention,
and... That's all.
Wonderful!
Thanks son.
That was a pleasing surprise.
# May you live long,
may you live long.
# Three blessings.
# May you live long,
may you live long.
# Three blessings
# Health! Health! Health! #
I am happy to be here with my family again.
On my birthday.
Father.
Blow on the candles.
Axel you have no idea
how happy I am
to be here today
with my father and my son.
He is Axel, my son,
you don't know him.
Mother.
Is that why you sent me to Israel?
Is that why you wanted
me to come with Pia?
That was a last moment thing.
I didn't think we could bring him in.
If I had known about this,
I wouldn't have come.
Don't speak to me of ethics.
Didn't you see
how happy your father was?
Sure.
Too bad that the oldie
won't hold a political speech.
Don't use that tone.
Especially you,
you've always done everything
to make us angry.
Why did you have to bring
that Jew in here?
You always seems to do everything
to get us embarrassed.
Is that what you think?
Aren't we tolerant enough?
All those years they spied on us
to see if we were in contact
with your grandfather
as if we were delinquent.
What did we do to them?
They even controlled our telephones...
I thought it was over
but I was wrong.
Perhaps I'm an idiot, but what happens
if your friend belongs to the Mossad?
If he doesn't, I'm sure
he'll join them after tonight.
Eyal?
He's alive. He's there at the villa.
- Sit down.
- He's there. I saw him.
- I thought he'd go there.
- He's very old, but we can get him out.
There are no bodyguards,
just a nurse.
Take this.
Are you crazy? Let's get him out and
bring him to trial in Israel. - Eyal!
It's really no problem. We can do it,
just the two of us. We just need a car
and we'll drive him to the pickup point.
- You don't get it. Nobody knows.
What d'you mean? We're...
- There's no we, no car, no pickup.
You have to finish this yourself.
Only you. Terminate him!
Terminate him?
- Yes.
Terminate.
- But Menachem...
We can get him out.
- Eyal, listen carefully.
Why did you come here? To find
this man, right? Now you've found him.
So maybe he's half-dead,
but only half.
And this is our chance. Not to
let him escape without punishment.
Go! Do the right thing.
For me, for your mother.
Go!
Don't be afraid.
Get him before God does?
Yes. Get him before God does.
Iris, my wife...
she didn't just leave, you see...
she killed herself.
She left me a note.
She wrote that I kill
everything that comes near me.
I can't kill anymore.
Just...
I don't want to kill anymore.
Hi, Axel.
It's 5 o'clock in the morning.
and Tom is finally asleep again.
I knew I shouldn't have listened
to you and your dear sister,
all that talk about having babies
and how it would change my life.
It did. I've become a sleepless slave.
I would go back
to bed now, but I can't.
We're picking melons this week.
Anyhow, you and this Andreas
of yours could come for a visit
you know, do the loving uncle thing,
so Pia and I can get away
for a few days.
The truth is being a father
is not that terrible.
It's actually quite fascinating,
all kinds of new things are happening to me.
I dream...
Last night I even dreamt about you.
We were north again,
by the Sea of Galilee,
and you take off
your sandals, step forward,
and simply begin to walk on the water,
and you don't fall,
you don't sink. Nothing
You're just walking on the water as though
it was the easiest thing in the world.
and then you turn around and hold out hand,
and I... I follow you.
and suddenly both of us
are walking on water.
And we keep walking and walking,
and there is this music all around us.
And I look at you and you smile at me.
And everything is so... peaceful.
And we feel good.
Just... good.
