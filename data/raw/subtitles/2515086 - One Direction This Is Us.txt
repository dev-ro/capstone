hen  was small  had a desk.
t was weird because  wrote on it
''hen  grow up  wanna be a singer. ''
lik e scribed it in.
And it's still on the desk.
Life at home was my dad
mom and my three sisters.
You could say  had
a heavy woman influence...
... from a young age.
e lived in a tiny house.
used to have a little bed
in my mum and dad's room.
used to sit on the windowsill and
imagine things lik e winning the lottery.
hen  was little  knew
that  wanted to entertain people.
was a proper show-off.
At school  was always
trying to play the class clown.
've always been that guy
that made people laugh.
used to get kick ed out of class
for singing...
...rish traditional songs
at the back of geography.
could always hear my sister's music
at the top of the stairs...
...and  used to pretend
to have a guitar...
...and 'd perform in my mirror
in my bedroom.
wasn't really interested...
... in things that other kids
were interested in.
hey were interested in football...
...and  was more creative.
herever  went my dad seemed
to tell people that  could sing.
t'd be lik e 2 3 in the morning...
...and 'd be singing full power
at the top of my v oice.
My sister'd be banging
on the wall going.
''Shut up you can't even sing.
Go to sleep. ''
-Three, two, one.
-We push!
hat was kind of  guess where...
... the dream started.
What'd you do that for?
Here we go, London!
O2 Arena, weIcome
to the Take Me Home tour!
London, are you ready?
One Direction! One Direction!
One Direction!
British boy band One Direction...
...has arrived...
... to the frenZied screams of fans.
Security was needed to control...
...hundreds of fans.
One Direction is taking over...
... the music world
one country at a time.
-One Direction.
-One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
hey're number one
here in Australia.
Number one in the U.S.
One Direction are number one...
... in more than 35 countries.
Even the BeatIes never achieved
such transatIantic success...
...so early...
... in their careers.
t's happened so so quickly.
t's not just unusual...
...it's unprecedented.
1 D definitely set...
... the pace for 201 2...
...selling out their entire 201 3...
...arena tour in mere hours.
he group was forced
to add even more dates...
...after selling out an impressive six
days at London's renowned O 2 Arena.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Now I'm feeIing good.
It's nerve-racking...
...being here now though,
and actuaIIy seeing, Iike...
...where you're actuaIIy pIaying.
Like, I sat here
the other week watching...
...Kanye West pIay.
And now we're here.
I just feeI a bit nervous.
AII right, feIIas, Iet's start.
So first day of rehearsaIs.
They've done...
...the same choreography the Iast
two years. Now I'm changing it.
Heads, WiII!
ShouId we start?
Louis, you're on that X.
was never really a fan...
...of boy bands before One Direction.
I'm a massive boy band fan myseIf.
Backstreet Boys, NSYNC.
When peopIe say,
''You're in a boy band'' ...
...I'm Iike, ''Yeah, I am,
but I'm in a cooI boy band.''
So I'm Iike, ''Okay, whatevs.''
Right from the start
we were always very v ocal...
... that we couldn't follow
the boy band stereotypes.
Choreographed dance routines,
and everything's the same.
Here we go!
Go, NiaII!
Taking the crowd with you!
Love the stag.
Keep the stag.
ReaIIy good, Iike that. Keep that in.
PauI, our choreographer...
...gets bored, I think.
NiaII, up that ramp.
Harry, come on!
It's a free-for-aII.
hey hate dancing...
... with a passion...
...and it goes to a whole sort of...
...different IeveI.
Can we just put that in?
Some point in the--
That's the dinosaur.
It's a bird pecking the sea.
No, the bird, you dance out here,
and the dinosaur's this.
I Iove how we basicaIIy take the piss
out of dance moves.
And the winner:
Zayn MaIik.
Okay, from the top.
When you go on tour...
...the outfit you've got's...
...the outfit you're stuck with...
...so I'm gonna be wearing these cIothes
for a good eight months now.
Is this working?
Can you get in?
I feeI weird wearing a trench coat.
It's the Harry StyIes Iook.
It Iooks good.
You Iook Iike one of those adverts.
You do though.
here's been times...
...when they've dressed us
aII in the same cIothes...
...and we're Iike,
'' No, we can't do that.''
This is the:
'' I'm gonna rob your nan'' Iook.
This T is bad, though.
I Iike this T-shirt.
-Is it not happening?
-They're a bit tight.
I just wanna see for the Iook.
Oh, my God.
e have to be our own people.
I don't think this band
wouId've worked if we wasn't...
...because as soon as
someone tries to teII us...
... what to do....
Now do a normaI one, pIease, honey.
It's Iike having five rowdy boys
in a cIass at schooI.
Honey...
...pIease.
Harry.
Come on. Harry.
Harry, come on...
...we've got so much to do today.
PIease, my darIing.
Yeah, thank you. Love you.
Come on, now.
Harry.
That is sick.
HoIy wow.
Nice to meet you. What's your name?
Liam.
I went on X Factor
when I was 1 4 the first time.
It's bad news.
Simon sent me home
because I was too young.
Why are you here today?
I'm here to be...
...the best artist I can be.
he first time...
... saw the One Direction boys
was when they auditioned...
...as soIo artists for he X Factor.
I don't know if any of you have seen my
first audition, but it was horrendous.
I hope it doesn't make
any part of this movie.
just murdered it.
I'd Iike to make a personaI apoIogy
to PIain White T's.
HeIIo.
So teII me a bit about you.
-I work in a bakery.
-And  was asking...
...stupid questions...
...about what pies are popuIar.
You see these people...
... that audition for the show
and they come from...
... the same sort of background as you.
They just come from normaI,
working-cIass famiIies.
-What's your name?
-My name's Zayn.
And then audition day...
...4:00 in the morning, I don't wanna
get out of bed and go audition.
So my mum
physically pulled me...
... out of bed.
Imagine if I'd stayed in bed that day.
Liam.
I went back on the show
with a bit of a point to prove.
One massive...
...fat aImighty yes.
Thank you so much.
e got down...
...to the Iast, Iike, 24 boys.
thought 'm so close to this now.
This is IiteraIIy--
I'm on the cusp of making it here.
The finaI...
...contestant...
...who's made it through...
...is:
Tom Richards.
could see my mom.
I went:
And she was going,
''Yeah, yeah, yeah.''
And I'm Iike,
'' No, this cIearIy means no.''
think a couple of us were crying.
e were absolutely gutted...
... when we got kick ed off.
I just don't wanna go home.
I just don't wanna go.
And then as I was, Iike,
about to Ieave...
Zayn MaIik.
Liam Payne.
... they just called all five...
... of our names out.
Harry didn't...
...have a clue.
I remember him saying, Iike:
''Yeah, you kept us back because
you wanna try and make us cry.''
''We're young boys
and we're aII gonna be crying.''
Make a bit of good TV.
And he was proper
having a fuII-on strop about it.
And then I made a decision,
and I did this in about 1 0 minutes.
Why don't we put these five boys
into a group?
hen...
...the most important thing
for us at that stage...
...for some reason, in our minds, was:
What are we gonna wear?
So ridicuIous.
e hadn't even...
...thought of a name. We didn't
even know if we couId sing together.
NiaII did say, ''We aII need to dress
a bit Iike Louis.''
NiaII Iooked at Louis' shoes.
He was quite cooI.
'' I Iike his shoes.
We shouId wear his shoes.''
Green poIo.
We Iike those jeans.
Let's aII wear those jeans.
I Iook back on it now.
If we'd have dressed Iike that....
e first got together...
...at Harry's dad's pIace.
e did not know each other...
...at aII.
e'd get together and sing a few songs
in the nighttime around the campfire.
e were meant to be rehearsing...
...but we actuaIIy ended up
pIaying footbaII.
Most of the time we just spent...
...having a laugh really.
e were lik e.
'' Let's just have fun.''
Let's just have fun and,
Iike, see what happens.
t was vital that we...
...made friends before
we became coIIeagues.
The first act through
on the pubIic votes is:
One Direction.
Love you!
Outside the studio
they've only sang once.
here's now 200 fans.
And I thought at the time,
''This is unusuaI.
This just doesn't happen
after one performance.''
The crowds were starting
to buiId outside the studio.
Harry, get a picture with me!
he fans were really hard-core...
...and they wouId just vote
Ioads and Ioads of times.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
One Direction.
What's happening?
've never seen a band...
...cause so much hysteria...
...so early in their career.
Leading up to the final...
... thought ''f 'm gonna bet...
... on any of these three...
... finalists these are the ones...
...'m gonna bet on. ''
he second act...
...stiII in the finaI is:
I don't think we're gonna win,
but I reaIIy, reaIIy want to win.
Just hoping for it.
Rebecca.
But...
...they Iost.
We were gutted.
Boys, how's this experience been for
you? What have been the highIights?
It's been absoIuteIy incredibIe.
hat could have been
the end of the road.
I think that was the thing
we were most worried about...
...because we just had such
a great time on he X Factor...
...and being together as a band.
Zayn, what's gonna happen
to One Direction now?
We're definiteIy gonna stay together.
-This isn't the Iast of One Direction.
-Ladies and gentIemen...
...give it up...
...for One Direction.
Unbeknown to me...
... once they left the show
it was all about the fans.
Literally from the second
it finished the fans...
...made it their mission
that One Direction...
...were gonna become
the biggest band in the worId.
This is why we have
the best fans in the worId.
I'm gonna prove it right now.
Proof.
-They're just amaZing.
-They're amaZing.
They can aIways make fans Iaugh.
They make me feeI so happy.
When I'm sad, they're here for me.
Oh, my God!
They're just genuine guys.
We Iove them
because they sing our feeIings.
They say what we want to hear...
-...and no boys, no one, says to us.
-Yes.
They can't be reaI.
They make us beIieve that everything
is possibIe if we beIieve in ourseIves.
I know they Iove me.
Even they don't know me. I know.
They have changed my Iife.
It may sound cheesy, but they have.
We Iove you, One Direction!
I'm right in front row!
You sing!
Here we go, O2!
think our fans are dedication...
...at its best.
hat they've done for us...
... in three years is just....
It's unheard of.
here was this group...
... of what  called...
...superfans.
And they were Iike promoters.
Go on, spread the word!
So  start tweeting...
...and I IiteraIIy made it my Iife.
I've sent Iike 1 6,000 tweets.
I was tweeting from Japan.
hat was quite mad...
... watching our witter...
...just graduaIIy, Iike, keep totting up.
hese girls...
...are craZy about One Direction,
and I've got no idea why.
I'm not a neuroscientist.
As soon as Directioners Iisten to music
and find the music pIeasurabIe...
...what happens in the brain...
...is that a neurochemicaI
caIIed dopamine...
...is reIeased and provides
feeIings of joy and happiness.
Shivers.
Goose bumps.
Strong pIeasure.
The girIs are not craZy.
The girIs are just excited.
Oh, my God!
he One Direction boys...
...are causing hysteria...
... everywhere.
It's akin to BeatIemania.
So a smaII group of British girIs...
...became a huge group...
... of British girls who then
turned Europe into huge fans.
America then stepped in.
So in the space of months
the fans got the entire planet...
... to support One Direction.
You sing!
Let me hear you...
...up top!
Pandemonium.
So the whoIe worId
are fans of One Direction.
And we haven't put a record out yet.
And then...
... we released...
...''What Makes You BeautifuI.''
First thought was,
'' CouId this work in America?''
here's not much of a track record...
... of any British boy bands...
...breaking in America.
But once everybody heard
''hat Mak es You Beautiful''...
... it was a perfect storm.
Stateside...
... these boys...
...are making history.
hey've gone...
...straight to the number one spot.
his week's number one.
Best British SingIe.
It's One Direction.
Lik e it just...
... took itself off...
...and took our career off too.
It just went:
hank you so much.
Yes they're all good-looking guys.
Yes, they can aII sing reaIIy weII.
But combine that...
... with the style...
... of music they were making...
... which was rock-influenced...
...so they had lik e...
...a little edge to it.
One Direction sound....
There's a IittIe hint
of something dangerous.
hey were slightly anarchic.
And that was their appeaI.
Today is our Iast day in the UK...
... for a while you know
e're going straight into
the ak e Me Home tour for 1 0 months.
U.S.A!
U.S.A!
he first time...
... it was literally just the UK
that we were playing out to.
Whereas now,
it's aII around the worId.
hen we started getting ready for it...
...we just knew that it had to be good.
think we felt lik e
we had a lot to prove.
he fans have spread...
...the word about One Direction
so much...
...that I think it might be
a IittIe bit different this time.
e never expected any of that...
...so now there's something
to Iive up to.
And if we don't Iive up to it,
then I don't know what happens next.
You hear about bands who've--
hey've come and they've gone.
don't wanna be one of those.
'' Madison Square Garden.
The worId's most famous arena.''
Now that sums it up.
I just don't know...
...where it goes from here, reaIIy.
It's mad.
I'm reaIIy nervous.
Me too, bro. Proper nervous, Iike.
So craZy.
Madison Square Garden.
No way did you ever think...
...that you wouId be coming
to Madison Square Garden...
-...to see them perform.
-No.
Here we are...
...hours before we head off
to see our babies.
Yeah.
'm in the mood
Romance
'm giving it all tonight
-'m in the mood for dancing
-'m in the mood for dancing
Romance
Even if one member...
...of your famiIy is in the audience,
it just adds to the nerves.
For aII of our famiIies to be together
in this pIace and be here, it's amaZing.
Your turn!
he main reason any of us...
... lads are here today
is because of our families...
...and the way they support us.
You know the...
-...standup boys.
-Cardboard standup.
I want a Louis one.
And then at night, I can just go...
...and say good night.
And that's my favourite hair on Liam.
I just Iove that one.
Just shed tears just Iooking at him.
-Yeah, you've onIy got the images.
-Yeah, that's aII you've got.
They become Iike
someone in a newspaper...
...in a magaZine, to you.
always believed that Liam
would mak e it but never this big.
Never in my wildest dreams
would  think he'd be this big.
He goes away for so Iong.
Sorry.
ith The X Factor
Harry went to an audition...
...and never came home again.
-You weren't ready for that, were you?
-No.
As a mother, I shouId be
taking him pIaces...
...and, you know, showing him things.
And it's just kind of turned round...
...and for him to bring us here...
... it tak es a bit of getting used to.
It feeIs quite surreaI.
PIease get ready.
It's no-arm boxing, baby.
You've gotta watch out--
No-arm boxing. Look at the time.
Not with just my pants on, anyway.
Hey.
Keep your Iens up here.
Guys, Martin Scorsese.
-PIeasure to meet you.
-Nice meeting you.
HeIIo.
I've been Iistening to your stuff,
I Iike it.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
That's amaZing, actuaIIy. So amaZing.
I've been giving her stuff,
and then she gives me stuff.
'm a big...
... One Direction fan.
They're gonna go aII the way.
They're gonna go higher.
Next time you see them, we're gonna be
in WembIey Stadium or Giants Stadium.
That's right.
And I'II be right there in the front row.
t's strange going from being...
...around your family constantly
to being with these guys.
But lik e knowing that
there's four of your best mates...
...it's a great feeIing to know
that you're not in it by yourseIf.
I can't beIieve I'm at MSG!
I'm just a IittIe boy from Bradford...
...and now I'm smashing it!
And you sort of feeI so proud.
You feeI Iike your heart
couId burst sometimes.
AII right. Let's give it our aII.
Come on, guys.
Come on!
n the back of your mind...
... there's always this bit of feeling...
... that you gotta kind of be ready...
...to pick up the pieces if it stops.
And it hasn't stopped.
Sing it!
You sing!
Let me see those hands!
Ladies and gentlemen we would
lik e to begin boarding Japan Airlines...
...Flight 3 20.
he amount of time
we've been away from home...
...just to mak e our band stronger
and be successful...
... is a lot and there's no rest.
It's just go, go, go.
Like, you fIy from one pIace
to another to another.
-See you.
-Bye-bye.
think we're very lucky in the fact that
when we were touring this time...
... we get to go to a lot
of different parts of the world...
...and you come across a place...
...you haven't been to yet. t's just...
...always so exciting.
-Harry!
-PIease, Harry!
PIease! Harry!
This is a IittIe strange.
This many photographers...
...aren't aIIowed in the buiIding
in, Iike, EngIand.
Hey, Harry!
Harry!
I'm excited.
1 D! 1 D! 1 D!
1 D! 1 D! 1 D!
How are you? You okay?
Let's go.
Bro, how craZy was that?
I've never seen that. That's mad.
That was craZy.
Like, you know, aII I kept thinking
was, ''And this is in Japan.''
Yeah.
Monorail!
t's so much cooler...
... to be in a band
than be by yourself.
Just simpIy because you've aIways
got peopIe to have a Iaugh with...
...peopIe to share
your experience with.
-Morning, everyone.
-Good morning!
Guys, gonna quickIy
run through the day with you...
...just so you know what's going on.
he way our life is moving
at the moment...
...there's no way I'd be abIe
to do this soIo.
I can't imagine being
in a hoteI room on my own.
'd be...
...bored to death.
e know that we've got a schedule
to get through...
...but we always think
to have a laugh...
...as we're doing it.
Do it.
hat's what mak es these trips...
...a lot easier.
Zip!
Okay.
Watch this.
This is what we came here for, Tommo.
Right.
-Do I have to drink it now, is aII?
-Do it.
-There we have it.
-Just try to--
-'' LittIe Things.'' LittIe taste.
-Yeah, Iet's run '' LittIe Things.''
e rarely get lik e a day off...
...when we Iand in pIaces
so it's just nice...
...to waIk around and expIore.
Stupid enough of me,
I didn't know it got that coId here.
Thought it wouId be one of
those countries that's aIways hot.
Why?
I don't know. Because I just pictured
AustraIia. It's quite near, isn't it?
Man, teII me.... Oh, no.
How cIose are we? Or am I taIking
the other side of the worId?
Come on, Liam.
It's Iike a soup.
It's miso.
-What was that? Miso soup.
-It's miso soup.
And you pour it in? You're meant
to pour it into your rice, yeah?
No, I think you drink it.
You drink it, you drink it, you drink it.
-Oh, Iook! 7-EIeven!
-7-EIeven!
Why have you done that?
-Said ''7-EIeven'' at the same time.
-WeII, I have to hit you as weII, then.
went around wearing...
-...a surgicaI mask.
-Oh, you did?
Yeah.
-Where'd you get one?
-I bought a packet of five.
-I have a spare one that you can have.
-Sick!
You've got to take your shoes off,
by the way.
Ghana...
... okyo London.
ProbabIy my three favourite pIaces.
I said, sit down.
I said, sit down!
Let's be honest, IreIand is the best
country in the worId. Hands down.
AbsoIuteIy not.
HeIIo.
Sing it!
Sing it!
There it is. The crown jeweI.
AII right then, Iads,
tourists for the day. Get in, NiaII.
Ghetto.
Can we do one of those pictures...
...where you go Iike that?
How do you do that?
Where you stand Iike this?
Like, touching the top.
-How do you do that?
-You have to get down.
Is it working?
Looks Iike you're hoIding it up.
We're back now.
Start of the European Ieg of the tour.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
We need to try one of them
IocaI deIicacy things...
...from every pIace.
And here's the frog Iegs
and snaiI stuff. Are you down?
I'm not down for snaiIs.
I think we shouId try it in every pIace.
Just try a deIicacy from somewhere.
I've tried frogs...
...but that's stiII not that weird.
Like, snaiIs
is probabIy a bit disgusting.
We've never toured Europe before...
...so because this is the first time we've
done it, it feeIs Iike an adventure...
...because a different country every
day, it feeIs Iike we're on Euro rip.
We're in D0sseIdorf.
Germany!
I heard BrusseIs
is a pIace to meet peopIe.
-My brother.
-Hey.
We found the BeIgian version
of me on the streets.
Just passed the baII
to the best pIayer in the worId.
Possibly the best ever.
After you.
Here you go.
-I'II just foIIow that up.
-You take the exact...
...same shot Louis.
It's Iike a big Iads' hoIiday, reaIIy.
With a Iot of work invoIved.
Big up yourseIf.
Can we sing it Iike this tonight?
Because it's actuaIIy reaIIy good.
Heigh ho heigh ho
t's off to work we go
ith a buck et and spade
And a hand grenade heigh ho
-Heigh ho heigh ho heigh ho
-Heigh ho
Hands in.
Put your hand in!
-Three, two, one.
-We push!
One Direction!
Good evening Paris!
The French fan is the best
because we are craZy.
Vive One Direction!
Good evening Oslo!
WeIcome to Norway! We Iove you!
StockhoIm, make some noise!
WeIcome to Sweden!
-Three, two, one.
-We push!
Good evening Antwerp!
This is gonna be good!
One Direction One Direction!
Europe has been so craZy...
...because there's a lot of fans
who have been there...
... for you know a year...
...two years, three years.
And they've just waited for us to come.
-Three, two, one.
-We push!
BerIin, make some noise!
I think we're in the 50s now,
Iike 53, maybe 54...
...out of 1 30-something shows.
So we're nearIy haIfway there.
You sing.
Sing it.
Just a naturaI, reaIIy, aren't I?
I mean, I don't mess about,
that's the main thing for me.
I think the Europe trip so far...
...has just fIown by. When you think
about tour rehearsaIs and everything...
-...it seems such a Iong time ago now.
-I know.
Do you remember
when we met at boot camp?
Yeah. I just saw you darting around...
...in your beanie every day
and just being Iike, '' Hey, I'm Harry.''
Those were the days, man.
NiaII was the Ioudest person
at boot camp, without faiI.
Wherever NiaII was,
there was a guitar...
...there was noise and
there was Ioads of peopIe around him.
-He was so popuIar.
-Yeah, I remember.
When we first got together,
there was aIways IittIe cIashes.
Yeah.
But there wasn't anything huge.
Do you remember when we went to the
coffee shop and Zayn didn't turn up?
-There was a serious conversation.
-I remember that.
There was a serious conversation...
...about kicking Zayn out of the band.
Oh, my God.
Imagine.
NiaII wouId have to be
the mysterious one.
I don't know. I think if I wasn't
in One Direction right now...
...I wouId be working in a factory
or being a fireman.
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.
Why did you wanna be a fireman?
I don't know.
I Iiked the idea of saving someone.
What about the factory?
WeII, that's just because me dad
worked there.
WouId you have not considered
opening your own bakery?
I was a great baker.
Fish!
Yes!
-Yeah!
-BIoody heII!
Fish! Fish! Fish!
The IittIe sprinter, face on the fIoor.
hen we're on tour...
... they're still normal boys
that lik e playing games.
That's the wrong way!
Won't stop me, eh?
am their dad on the road.
e have a very good
working relationship.
he only issue  have is they're all...
...a pain in the ass.
Nothing to see here, sir!
hey're pranksters.
They Iove pIaying...
... tricks on us.
Back to the dressing room.
Some people might look at it
and say...
... this is not very professional
with all the clown acting...
...and jumping and fighting...
...and all that kind of stuff
but that's just part and parcel of...
...what One Direction is.
I don't even have a Iicence!
Sorry, I can't hear you!
Put me down!
Guys! Guys! Stop.
-Sorry, mate!
-Hey, guys!
Six minutes till the biggest show
of the whole tour...
...and here they are...
...taking bIoody goIf buggies.
Hey, guys!
Guys, come on, we gotta go!
We just try and contain them.

...the key!
Get to work!

Can't teII you, it's a surprise.

There you have it.
This is what happens.
Step back. Step back, pIease.
One Direction! One Direction!
One Direction!
We don't come out that often...
...so we don't reaIIy see,
Iike, this sort of side of it that often.
So when we do, it's aII a bit strange.
-I Iove you!
-Some girI was just trying...
...to IiteraIIy grab my ear. I think she
wanted to keep it, but I was Iike:
''That's mine, Iove,
you can't have that, unfortunateIy.
It's connected.''
Let's go, go, go.
Where'd the gIasses come from today?
Somebody chucked them on stage.
I put them on. These are sick.
-Look, they're red on the inside.
-Nice.
-Look at that.
-Quite cooI, huh?
You Iook Iike some sort of
sexy secretary.
Let's move out, men!
e've got days off scheduled.
Hey, have fun going home.
See you Iater, yeah?
Have a fun fIight home, you.
I'II try but I'II miss you too much, Liam!
See you Iater!
HeIIo!
spend every single day
with these lads.
t's really weird to not have...
...the other four Iads around me.
But  do actually look forward
to going home.
Sing it, O2!
Let me hear you, London!
How we doing in the back?
So baby  if you say
You want me to drive
o KFC
I Iove chicken.
I Iike HoImes ChapeI. Pretty much...
...every other part
of my Iife has changed...
...apart from coming down here.
It's just exactIy the same.
My first kiss was down there.
I kissed a girI,
Iike, a bit further down.
We were, Iike, against a tree.
It was pretty steamy.
Come on, come on.
He just missed an open goaI!
Oh, we're gonna catch this.
e don't realise how much we
appreciate our family and hometown...
...untiI you're gone.
This is my IittIe room in the house.
Isn't that just the creepiest thing ever?
For the first few nights I was here,
I came in every night...
...and I opened the door
and I was Iike, ''Jesus.''
I thought there was somebody
in my room, but it was just me.
''Oh, it's just me again.''
I'm pretty sure this is the onIy job
that I wasn't sacked from.
If there's any customers around...
...any nice-Iooking Iadies,
I just pop out a few piano skiIIs.
And just try and impress...
...whiIe in my gIamorous
Toys '' R'' Us uniform.
AII right, there we are, Iook.
On a Iunchbox.
Next to Spider-Man.
It's quite funny,
it seems Iike a Iifetime ago.
hen we get a day off
lik e to kind of just be left alone...
... to just relax and chill out.
his is lik e my graffiti room.
just decided that  wanted...
...to spray-paint the waIIs.
t's cool man
because nobody can tell me  can't.
Could you imagine if  wanted to do
this at my house at home
My mom wouId be, Iike, '' No way.
You're not spray-painting on my waIIs.
I don't think so.''
Got my own house. I'm Iike, '' Course
I'm gonna spray-paint on the waII.''
work ed at the bak ery...
... for about two and a half years.
There you go.
I stiII got it, you know.
One seventy-six and your receipt.
work ed with old ladies.
Bye.
Very nice old ladies.
-Barbara!
-Harry!
Hi.
She's the one who used to
pinch my bum on the side.
Yes, I did.
Look out!
-I'II pinch your bum a bit more.
-See?
You know you meet a lot of people...
...who kind of see...
... lik e a media perception of you.
And it's just nice coming here...
...and spending a bit of time...
...with peopIe who know me.
Most important part...
... of having time off.
Being abIe to come home and see...
...me mother me father...
...my brother Greg.
Lord, may Denise and Greg...
...be united in Iove forever.
never had any...
...problem going up
and asking me father...
...anything. The birds and the bees,
the one-two-threes.
He left here as a 1 6-year-old.
He knows more about Iife
than me reaIIy now.
I come from a very ruraI background.
StiII Iive in a ruraI background.
He's going out and seeing
the worId. I can't give him advice.
He knows where he's at.
This is the fifth day...
...he's actuaIIy been home
since he Ieft...
...two and a haIf years ago
for X Factor.
Yeah.
-Hi, Iove.
-Good to see you, my darIing!
How are you? Are you aII right?
Long time since I saw Louis.
I know.
I see you every day
when I waIk out the toiIet
because you're on the waII.
Goodbye, my Iove.
So IoveIy to see you.
I'II get my earpIugs then
and I'II come to see your shows.
Yeah, that'd be IoveIy.
I don't think we get to see him enough.
There's a Iot of things said about
the mom's spirit and feeIing towards it.
But dads do feeI it as weII,
especiaIIy at 1 7.
You'd love to have
that son around you.
Your watch! CouId I have a Iook
at that watch you got on?
AII I had to offer him was to take him
drinking and pIaying snooker.
I didn't reaIIy have an awfuI Iot
to offer him...
...but that's part of your establishment
as a young man.
And that time went.
I've missed it. I've missed it.
You popping back in tomorrow?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.
He's the onIy feIIow in the famiIy.
He's gone.
AII right, Iet me get ready
and then I'II be up, taIk to you.
Got a....
Got a show today.
I'm exhausted.
Let's go!
One Direction just released...
...a new video...
... for their single
''One ay Or Another. ''
he 1 D boys...
... flew to Africa
as part of their inv olvement...
... with Comic Relief.
hey're donating the cash...
... they would have spent on a video...
... to a charity that strives to create...
...a world free from poverty.
he success of the song
was extraordinary.
hey raised well over
a million pounds.
And the great thing is that...
... they saw when they were
out in Africa...
...just how many...
... individual lives...
...that that wiII make
a huge difference to.
PiZZa! PiZZa! PiZZa!
It sounds Iike they're shouting
'' piZZa.'' Are they?
European fans lik e
they're just craZy.
They don't come out in the tens and
hundreds. They come out in thousands.
just wish that  could just go along
each person and just lik e...
... chat to them. ith how busy
the schedule is it's really frustrating...
...that you can't stop and taIk to them
and teII them what they've done for us.
Five minutes, we're on stage!
One Direction! One Direction!
-Three, two, one.
-We push!
MiIan, make some noise!
Thank you so much for having us!
We've been One Direction!
This one's for you.
Thank you.
still get a buZZ
every time  go out on stage.
still come off with...
... the biggest adrenaline rush.
hen  get to...
... come on the bus
and stay up with my mates...
...and laugh about things
that we did on stage.
Do you know when I taped you up in the
middIe of the show with the bIack tape?
Is that what you did?
I know, it faiIed miserabIy.
You shouId have just gone with it.
Thanks for your heIp, mate.
One girI-- That is...
-...awfuI.
-Putrid. It is absoIuteIy putrid.
Own up. Own up.
-Oh, my God.
-Who's farted? NiaII?
NiaII.
You know, sometimes when it gets
reaIIy smeIIy, NiaII doesn't admit it.
-Do you know what I mean?
-HoId on.
Who's the first to admit their farts?
You shouId be proud
of a smeII Iike that.
-It was a creeper.
-No, it wasn't.
Man, I wouId admit that smeII.
Let's caII it.
NiaII, NiaII...
...you've been outed.
Zayn.
I hate to do this, dude.
I just onIy need you for a bridge.
What time is it now?
You've been asIeep for 1 0 minutes.
-I'm sorry, dude.
-No, I'II get up.
AII right. I appreciate it.
Recording this third album has been...
...extremeIy hard. We've been
waking up in the morning...
...and going straight to the studio.
Then going to the arena...
... doing a show.
And then going straight back
to the studio after a show.
So it's been reaIIy tough
for us this time.
AII of my 1 0 minute sIumber.
We have to get...
...'' Best Song Ever.''
It feIt Iike it was the next morning
and you were aIready waking me up...
...and I was Iike, ''Oh, my God.''
One, two, three.
Give me one time short
on the ''ever.''
My bad.
What is it again?
his time...
... we felt musically stronger.
But at the same time...
... that pressure's back on you know
ill we match the second one
We're about to take me home.
I'm naked recording.
SmeIIs Iike man in here.
SmeIIs Iike a mixture of boy and man.
f you could imagine yourself...
...being taken away
at 1 6 or 1 7 years of age...
...and then thrown...
... into the spotlight.
We're incredibIy excited...
...to announce
that we are gonna be doing...
...a worIdwide stadium tour...
...in 201 4.
People are constantly around them.
And to hoId their nerve and cooI...
...and enjoy it and perform...
... it's a big big ask.
Zayn's recording aII night tonight,
then it's you and Louis tomorrow.
here's definitely times where...
...you're not, Iike...
...compIeteIy enjoying it
the whoIe time.
But then you kind of just have to
step back for lik e a second...
...and try and weigh out
the pros and the cons.
t's lik e-- t's a no-brainer.
I don't wanna do anything eIse.
f you actually sit and think about it...
...we've done some amaZing things.
But to be honest with you
'm still trying to live a normal life.
hat's exactly what we are.
e're just normal...
... 1 9 20 21-year-olds...
...you know just going out...
...and mess about lik e any other...
...guy at university or whatever.
We're not doing anything different.
That's what I mean by us being normaI.
Our jobs just happen to be abnormaI.
Bedtime for me.
Bedtime for me.
don't lik e people saying
''You're famous. ''
just struggle with the word.
t just gives you lik e no substance.
It's not Iike,
'' He was a reaIIy nice guy'' ...
...or, '' He was reaIIy funny.''
It becomes this thing where it's Iike,
'' He's famous.'' And it's just a weird....
I hate it.
worry about meeting
somebody who's...
...truthfuI and is 1 00 percent just there
because of me.
I just don't Iike the idea of somebody
Iiking me because of this...
...and not because of me.
And it's hard to detract and think:
'' If I didn't have aII this,
wouId this person Iike me or not?''
Come on, Iadies and gentIemen,
in we go.
Show starts at 8:30.
Get invoIved. Come on, inside.
Get your T-shirts and your drinks
and stuff. Get in, come on.
We got a show to put on.
We're going to try and fooI the fans.
So 'm gonna dress up...
...as a security guard...
... who works at the O 2.
HoIy moIy.
Are you meant to be sitting there?
GirIs, you're Iooking...
...for your seats?
B three, just up here, girIs.
This is row B, Iadies.
-This is your row.
-Thank you very much.
-Big fans, girIs, yeah?
-Yeah.
-Are you a big fan?
-Yeah.
Who's your favourite?
Darren?
EarpIugs, Iadies? There you go.
CoupIe of sexy earpIugs for you.
Because they're not great, these boys.
They can't reaIIy sing,
they can't reaIIy dance.
What's your favourite song?
''What Makes You BeautifuI.''
Never heard that.
Look at me, I'm not
the greatest Iooking feIIow, so....
I'm not beautifuI at aII, reaIIy.
I seen them the other night,
they're not the best.
I think they're crap.
Why do you Iike One Direction?
They're perfect.
They're perfect?
Far from it, Iove. I teII you what...
...they're not great at aII.
I don't know why you even Iike
One Direction!
They're crap! AII go home!
I quit this job...
...it's crap! I'm going back to GIasgow.
That is absoIuteIy nuts.
Mak es me a bit uncomfortable.
I'm actuaIIy scared of you.
You Iook Iike...
...a fat RusseII Brand.
I want to Iook Iike you when I'm oIder
because I think you Iook...
...quite interesting.
One, two, three, four.
O2 Arena!
London, I wanna kiss every singIe...
...one of you!
Go craZy.
One, two...
...three, four!
Are there any bears in Sweden?
We need one of them
big Iong machetes.
Where are we putting the tent?
-Set up tent here.
-Over here?
-Yeah.
-And make the fire here.
Let's just cIear some of this.
I'm on pine cone duty.
To be fair, when we make tents...
...I'm normaIIy the one who just
pretends to be busy the whoIe time.
Oh, it's good...
-...that the instructions are in Swedish.
-Don't need...
...instructions, Liam.
-Here we go. This is the one we need.
-Yeah, this is the fIoor.
What? You put it through
the things or this?
-What you do with this?
-And this bit goes on there, I think.
Stick the-- CIip the IittIe siIver--
I think we've done the wrong one.
Looking good, Iads.
Because then the other bit
goes over the top of it.
-No, you have to--
-This is not going very weII.
That IittIe hoIe.
Oh, there we go. I've smashed it.
Liam's nearIy cIocked it
in about five minutes.
Has anybody got a hammer?
Where are you making the fire?
Here.
Oh, thanks, Iads. Yeah. Cheers.
You're not doing...
...a tepee fire?
Listen, forget what they taught you
in Scouts.
We're doing it the Tommo way.
Now we know how to make camp fires.
Louis, you idiot!
Right. I think we'II just burn it
Iike that now.
Do you think if one of us...
...wasn't in the band, though,
the band wouId be this big?
-No.
-No. DefiniteIy not.
I don't think so either.
I think we each baIance each other out.
Yeah.
I think when we Iook back at this...
...no matter what we do after this,
we'II never, ever beat this.
Yeah, but isn't that scary?
-If the best times of your Iife are now...
-Don't you think it's a bit...
-...that's craZy.
-...of a Benjamin Button thing, though?
That we get to do it backwards.
Do you know what I mean?
We get to go after this...
...and then have a proper, normaI Iife.
Just have, Iike, a wife and kids.
Do you know what I mean?
Don't you think that's quite nice?
That's what I Iook forward to...
...if I Iook forward to anything.
What's mad is that one day...
...we won't be doing this.
-I know.
-Yeah.
So do you think, Iike...
...we're stiII gonna be mates?
-I think so, yeah.
-I think we wiII as weII.
Do you want my e-maiI now
or shaII I give it to you Iater?
I think we've gone through...
-...too much together.
-Yeah.
We'II aIways be...
...part of each other, Iike,
growing up.
I'm just gIad...
...that we did it...
...right from the start
how we wanted to do it.
Yeah.
There's been so many bands
that have come and gone.
And no one reaIIy taIks
about them anymore.
I'd Iike to be...
...Iike, remembered for
the records that we did.
Do you know what?
It'd just be amaZing to be remembered...
...Iike, even as a mum
teIIing her daughter:
''The boy band at my time,
One Direction, they just had fun.''
Do you know what I mean?
''They were just normaI guys...
...but terribIe, terribIe dancers.''
Yeah.
Are they down here?
I'm excited to
see what's gonna happen.
Two, one.
Everybody, three, two, one.
So I'm gonna just
get in the car up here.
Come on, girIs.
Can't believe actually today's here.
have a present for you.
There you go.
-CongratuIations.
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-My pIeasure.
-Thank you.
The key.
Right. Are we ready?
It's big, Mama!
Oh, it's IoveIy.
Oh, it's gorgeous, isn't it?
e'll go upstairs.
This is your room.
Okay, you know what?
Don't dirty the windows.
HeIIo?
Hello sunshine. How are you
HeIIo, you aII right, Mum?
t's just so nice to hear your v oice.
Yours too. What's going on?
've just rung to say your house...
...is amaZing.
-You happy
-More than happy, Zayn.
t's lik e a dream come true.
It's aII right. That's why I did it,
didn't I? I toId you that I wanted to.
know you always used to say.
'' I'II aIways get you a house, Mum,
when I'm oIder.''
I know you did, but....
That's the best thing, isn't it,
about what we're doing?
You work so hard, Zayn, and I just....
'm so proud of you.
Very  very proud of you.
I can't even thank you enough...
...for what you've done for us.
t's all right Mum.
You don't have to cry.
You're just happy, aren't you?
Happy tears. It's aII good.
I'm happy. I'm very happy.
WeII, get off the phone then
before I start crying.
All right then. Okay.
Love you. See you.
-TaIk to you Iater. AII right, bye-bye.
-Bye.
t's amaZing man.
That's IiteraIIy why I auditioned
for the show in the start.
Like, I just wanted to be abIe to...
...give back to my mum and stuff.
So it's wicked to be abIe to do that.
It's reaIIy cooI.
Tonight is the biggest show
we've ever done.
I'm just throwing it out there.
e are playing...
...to 65,000 peopIe tonight.
It's just insane.
Good Iuck.
Look at the amount of poIicemen...
-...we've got.
-I can't get over...
...how many poIice bikes there are.
They've got 40 poIicemen on us...
...and then they've got Iike
1 000 poIicemen on the streets.
It's quite scary, but it's quite fun...
...at the same time.
We IiteraIIy have Iike a smaII army.
We do have the army.
Let's take over this pIace.
What is that girI...
...doing out the top of the car?
With an EngIish hat on.
She is a IiteraI rebeI.
I'm gonna marry her one day.
CooI.
Man, this pIace is huge.
-Imposing, is what it is.
-It's big.
Just looking at the siZe of the place
just gives that...
...extra edge
to the nerve in a way...
...because there's Iike
doubIe the peopIe to impress.
How's it going?
Hey, man.
Wow, this is big.
Let's have a Iook.
This is mad.
Bad idea.
Nice day.
Oh, my God. This pIace is huge.
This is mad.
Sick.
his is absolutely mad.
can't wait to get out here...
...and pIay. I just wanna get on with it.
HeIIo.
t was the most exciting thing
in the world.
I reaIIy wish my parents were here,
actuaIIy, to see it...
...because they don't get to see
a Iot of us...
...and to see us
doing something Iike this...
...and see what it's aII about....
But it's good we're getting it in
the fiIm, so they'II get to see anyway.
So everyone's a winner.
You know if we'd got ask ed...
... two years ago
what we thought would happen...
...we never wouId've said this.
hen  think about how lucky...
...we actuaIIy are
to be in this position....
It's, Iike, probabIy one in a miIIion
chance to be where I am.
-Three, two, one.
-We push!
f one of us...
...just didn't happen to...
...go to our audition then...
...you know, it couId be so different.
e are definitely...
...the five Iuckiest dudes.
Good evening, Mexico City!
Oh, my God.
One of the best things about...
...all of this...
... the fact that  have now...
...made four new best friends.
Mexico!
e're all there for each other...
...and I think that's why it works.
t's cool man.
You don't get that...
...if you're a soIo artist.
Now we're just...
... five...
...brothers, if you Iike...
...because we spend more time with
each other than we do our own families.
e just feel lucky that...
... there's not one guy...
... in the group...
...who's an absoIute ass.
You guys have been right there...
...since day one.
And it means...
...so much to us because
none of this wouId happen...
...without you.
The fans compIeteIy
changed our Iives.
e are so thankful.
And I think it's important...
... that we try and let fans know...
... that this is...
...a teamwork between us and them.
We've got the best fans in the worId.
don't think we'll
ever get fully used to it...
...because it's all just a bit too mad.
We just go about it day to day,
and we don't take it too seriousIy.
And that's the main sort of thing
that we aII Iive by that keeps us...
...you know, as us.
I couId just do this
for the rest of my Iife.
just love it so much.
You know 'd do it till  was lik e...
...weathered and peopIe were asking
why I was stiII aIive and stuff.
Like Keith Richards.
hat a gig though.
I mean, we even got fireworks.
Yeah, amaZing.
You know what, Liam?
You are one of the worst-smeIIing
peopIe I've ever known.
-Yeah.
-CouId we have a nod or a shake...
...from the camera if I'm smeIIy.
Am I smeIIy?
Sing it!
Last time, O2. Make some noise.
Sing it!
Let me see those hands.
Come on, everyone.
You guys sing!
Am I better when I'm naked?
I Iike...
...being free.
I recorded ''What Makes You BeautifuI''
in my boxers.
Who gets to go on the O2 stage
in their dressing gown? Not many...
...so 'm gonna live that dream boys.
And 'm gonna go out there and rock...
...me little socks off.
Thanks, everyone!
Free hugs.
Free.
Free hugs, anyone?
I Iove you.
You'II give me a hug, won't you? Yeah.
Another hug.
And one more?
One more hug?
PIease. One more? PIease.
