Bravery Triumphs!
The magician swirled the wand
as he chanted the mantra.
Razzle, dazzle!
The palace began
to crumble down.
Save us! The King and the people
trembled in fear before the magician.
The warrior came to their rescue.
He dashed into the crumbling palace
to save the princess.
He held the walls and entered
the palace.
Princess, don't fret.
I am here. Hold on to me.
The warrior tied the
dangling curtains together.
The warrior jumped out
with the princess.
The princess was in
awe at the warriorâ€™s deed.
The magician swirled his wand
and chanted his mantra.
Razzle, Dazzle!
He gained might as the magic unfurled.
As the warrior pushed a stone...
a pillar tripped the magician.
The warrior braces himself for
a great war to protect the people.
He stopped the magician's blow
with his right hand.
He climbed on his legs and
stomped hard on his chest.
He smashed the magic wand
with his right hand.
As the warrior kicked him,
the magician fell to the ground.
Who are you?
The... The... The...
THE...GREAT... WARRIOR.
Even if Yeman, the God of Death
himself wrongs the people...
I'd fight back.
Like in hell.
Such a scaredy-cat.
Will he dare say that to
my face?
Looks like he is demanding money.
Does Paguthi have his name
written all over the government water?
I don't know.
If you want to slosh your house,
you got to pay up 10 rupees per bucket.
Sister, take a bucket from mine.
-Keep quiet, will you.
Why should I pay?
I don't fear these party guys.
Hey.
Why is she yelling?
Yes, that is what I am looking at...
can't she just smack him and
bring the water? Why yell instead?
Who is he to deny me water?
-Why are you sticking it low, paste it up there.
Hey. Over there.
Did that Paguthi think no
one would dare question him?
Let him get here!
I will tear him down to pieces.
Ma...
Sathya. Hey.
Sathya. Hey.
Don't you have an ounce of fear, ma?
Why are you picking fights
with the partymen?
Do the partymen have horns
or something?
Just move, ma.
Will the house come crumbling
down if you donâ€™t slosh it for a day?
Only the one building it
knows the struggle.
I'll go fetch the water.
Let me see who dares question me.
Ma! Ma!
Hold on.
Water is all you need, right?
Hmm.
Where is he going to find the water?
Huh.
From Vaigai.
I have packed some fryums,
she might forget it in the auto.
Tell her to eat properly
atleast today.
Give me your bucket.
The warrior jumped with the princess.
-That is it.
Why create a scene for this?
Learn to adjust and live.
The princess was in awe
at the warriorâ€™s deed.
Give it to me.
The princess doesn't look nice. You
could have drawn me instead, you know?
Yeah, sure.
Ilavarasi!
-Am coming, pa.
Hold on to it carefully.
I'll take leave now, ma.
-Take care.
Are there any plumbers here?
Me.
Come on you.
Me.
Any painters here?
-Yes.
You can come.
What about construction workers?
-Me.
Both of us.
You two, come here.
C'mon in. Start the vehicle, move it.
Let's get going.
Any tamil guys here?
Hmm.
Everyone except him can
get in the vehicle.
Quick, make it fast.
I am heading to the front, brother.
(speaks in Hindi)
Quick.
Who wanted the cigs?
A cup of tea and a smoke, brother.
-Here.
Don't you have any change?
Brother, one coffee.
What is this?
-Sorry, sir.
I did it out of habit.
Wait, I'll be back.
One lights, brother.
Sir...
you told me that you'd talk about the job.
-I am trying.
Hardly anyone reads this...
they're talking about running
ads in its place.
Hiring someone new is not an easy deal.
Let me see.
One smoke, brother.
What else?
Move your bag.
My bike broke down.
Give me the address, sir.
I'll be there.
Alright.
2 9 4...
Ganapathi street...
Aazhvarthirungar.
-Hey.
Why are you writing over this?
I'll call you back, sir.
Why did you snatch the paper?
But...
why are you writing over
the comics?
I paid for it. I can do
whatever I want with it. What is it to you?
It is just a paper to you...
but do you know how
difficult it is to draw that?
Firstly, you got to find an interesting
story...
calculate the number of strips,
divide the panels, make the layout...
write the dialogues and space
the bubbles...
sketch it with pencil,ink
it and brush over that.
Do you know how long
it takes to draw one strip?
Why are you sulking like you drew it?
Do you want to know the story
that will be printed tomorrow?
Really ? Did you draw this?
- Yes.
Don't breathe a word to anyone
that I told you this story.
So, you are Subramani?
It is in the paper.
Yes.
Hey... hold on a second.
Ma!
Where would we go if you ask us
to vacate immediately?
We've lived here since the times
of our ancestors.
Let's protest that we can't.
Do you think they'll let it go
if we protest?
We will be left with nothing
if we fight the government.
The minister is generously offering
us 1 BHK houses.
We'd be left with nothing
if we lose it.
Think about it.
There are attached bathrooms
inside the house...
you can use it whenever you want to.
No trouble of mosquitoes.
The house is cozy and cool.
Your child can sleep in peace.
Do you even have a single plot
in your name?
A 450 square feet house in your name
is a big deal, you know.
It will be useful for your daughter,
if not for you. Think about it.
Child, do you know how to write
your father's name?
Yes.
Yes, step a bit closer.
Hold up the slate.
Yes.
Hold it up. Yes.
Look over there.
Look, everyone is leaving.
You don't get it no matter
how many times I repeat.
Apartment houses are awaiting you.
Why don't you get the tokens and leave?
Why are you stubborn to stay here in the stench?
Why should I get it?
This is my house, my land.
Take your slate and go away.
Well, don't. How does it matter to me?
Let's go, sir.
They will only learn it
the hard way.
They've switched off the transformer.
There will be no power from now on.
Hey, bring the candle.
Ma...
Let's go, ma.
Make sure to take all inflammables
like gas cylinders and kerosene cans.
Brother, can you click a picture
in front of my husband's portrait?
Don't think you can come
and pick it up later.
This place is going to be
razed to the ground.
What are you looking at?
Your mom insisted that the house
should be in your name.
Okay, stand now.
Turn the slate and hold it up.
Click.
Leave, get going.
What are you looking at? Leave.
Go, go.
Leave.
Go and get inside the vehicle.
Send them fast.
Keep moving, go.
Go and get in your respective vehicles.
Hey, here. C'mon now. Go.
Leave, move. Go.
Get in your respective trucks.
Keep moving.
Keep it over there.
Ma. Come look at it.
Give that to me.
Look, will you.
Oh my...
Hey, look over there.
That is our house.
Hey, look at how massive it is.
-It is good, isn't it?
They will allot houses to us
based on the tokens they gave us.
B-Block. 10th floor. House no: 193.
10th floor?
I'm not climbing 10 flights of stairs!
- There is an elevator!
You don't have to take the stairs.
Here.
10th floor it seems.
-Ma.
I'll take leave, brother.
-Okay.
Stop shoving me!
Ma, you come in the lift.
We will take the stairs, come.
Hey.
It is amazing, isn't it?
Hey look, a separate room for kitchen.
Yes.
And here.
Bro, the sea is visible from here.
If you take pictures of this and post
stories, you can get so many likes.
You're always obsessed with that.
Wow, the balcony is the best.
Brother, there is someone in there.
- What?
Where?
- Inside.
Who was it?
No clue, ma. It must've been urgent.
Why? Canâ€™t he use his house
if it was that urgent?
First come inside, ma...
and take a look at the house.
This is my house,
just for them to chill.
Werenâ€™t you stubborn that you wouldnâ€™t
move? See, the house looks like a palace.
Didnâ€™t you collect money
for the temple festival?
We donâ€™t even have a
temple now. Pay us back, man.
Huh?
What if there is no temple now?
This house is our temple
from now on.
All of you can take off the amulets now.
Let's celebrate the house warming like a carnival!
â™ª You stretch as the skies, â™ª
â™ª as the Earth beneath us. â™ª
â™ª You are the body and the spirit. â™ª
Ma, look over here.
â™ª You are the spirit. â™ª
Ma, smile a little.
â™ª We are here, trusting you. â™ª
â™ª Watch over us and protect us. â™ª
â™ª Guide us. â™ª
â™ª Descend now and come dance with us. â™ª
â™ª Dance amidst us. â™ª
â™ª Oh what a scene! â™ª
â™ª We are quite a scene now. â™ª
â™ª Here, dear brother. â™ª
â™ª Here. â™ª
â™ª New avenues are welcoming us. â™ª
â™ª Come, my dear brother. â™ª
â™ª C'mon now. â™ª
â™ª Let's vibe together, brother. â™ª
â™ª This refreshing song... â™ª
â™ª flows from the lively â™ª
â™ª beats of the drums. â™ª
â™ª Our time has come. â™ª
â™ª It is time to rise our hands. â™ª
â™ª The huts are gone now. â™ª
â™ª They have become palaces instead. â™ª
â™ª Let's rejoice this scene! â™ª
â™ª Let's savor it to the fullest! â™ª
â™ª Groove to the vibrant beats! â™ª
â™ª Dance your hearts out â™ª
â™ª as the drums play! â™ª
â™ª On one side, there is the Bay of Bengal. â™ª
â™ª And on the other side, our palace â™ª
â™ª stands tall. â™ª
â™ª As long as we live together â™ª
â™ª in joy... â™ª
â™ª Everyday is a celebration. â™ª
â™ª Burst the crackers and spark the joy! â™ª
â™ª On one side, there is the Bay of Bengal. â™ª
â™ª And on the other side, our palace â™ª
â™ª stands tall. â™ª
â™ª As long as we live together â™ª
â™ª in joy... â™ª
â™ª Everyday is a celebration. â™ª
â™ª Burst the crackers and spark the joy! â™ª
â™ª Look at that swing on the tenth floor! â™ª
â™ª And angels fly beside us. â™ª
â™ª Gone are the days of empty cans. â™ª
â™ª Now a giant water tank is at our â™ª
â™ª service all day. â™ª
â™ª Since the ages of our fathers and ancestors... â™ª
â™ª we have dwelled together. â™ª
â™ª And today, the people moved to â™ª
â™ª a new life here. â™ª
â™ª Leaving behind their town â™ª
â™ª for the very first time. â™ª
â™ª Come, dear brother. â™ª
â™ª Chin up, now. â™ª
â™ª Walk with pride, brother. â™ª
â™ª Don't hate anyone. â™ª
â™ª Let's do away with hatred. â™ª
â™ª Let's not make a fuss, dear. â™ª
â™ª Everyone is equal here. â™ª
â™ª Shout it out loud, dear. â™ª
â™ª Dance away to your heart's content. â™ª
Hey, why are you scribbling on the
walls of our house?
What? Our house?
Huh.
â™ª On one side, there is the Bay of Bengal. â™ª
â™ª And on the other side, our palace â™ª
â™ª stands tall. â™ª
â™ª As long as we live together â™ª
â™ª in joy... â™ª
â™ª Everyday is a celebration. â™ª

â™ª Burst the crackers of joy! â™ª
â™ª Burst the crackers of joy! â™ª
â™ª Burst the crackers of joy! â™ª
Ma.
Look what a house we have bagged.
It would be perfect if we fix a 40
inch TV, switch on a film and sit back.
That is the only thing we're missing
with the money you're making.
Your dadâ€™s photos are still
downstairs, get them and fix it first.
-Hmm.
Hey, Raji.
Yes.
-Get ready fast.
It is already late.
-Okay, ma.
I didnâ€™t do a thing, ma.
I just unlatched the door
and it came off just like that.
How will it come off just
like that in a new house?
What kind of a house have they built?
Where is that guy Paguthi?
-Ma, ma. Hold on, ma. Hold on.
Why are you tying your hair up now?
Loosen it, c'mon.
What is wrong now?
It only falls here, right?
That is it.
Raji, push it now.
It doesn't come off, right?
-No.
That is it.
Why stir up a mess for this?
Learn to adjust and live, ma.
Yeah, sure. Hey, quick. Get ready.
Huh.
Get something from the canteen
for lunch.
Okay, ma.
Be safe.
- Okay. See you, ma.
Ma, ma. No. Please listen to me.
Don't.
Ma, ma. Don't.
Hey, Paguthi. Where is that guy?
He is in the engineerâ€™s room.
Half the switches aren't working.
-Ma...ma!
We can neither use the fans or lights...
-Ma, only you get worked up over everything...
how do we sleep? What is this?
-no one here seems to have an issue.
Everything comes off with just a touch.
We can't even hammer a single nail.
The bathroom tap is busted and
my house is almost flooded now.
Did you break it already?
Itâ€™d obviously break if
you go at it like savages.
What is this, sir?
How can you talk like this
to the people who've come to us in plight?
Ma, weâ€™ll fix everything.
Hmm.
-Don't worry.
Hey, note down the house number.
Add 300 rupees for the tap.
-What?
Why should we pay?
Donâ€™t you have the contract for 6 months?
Well, fix it then.
Are you giving me orders?
You think Iâ€™m here to serve you?
Stay here if you like...
or simply leave.
Where to?
You razed down our
houses and dumped us here.
Hey, Paguthi. You duped us into coming here,
assuring us that we'd have apartment houses.
Answer us now.
Ma, please keep quiet.
Speak up!
Ma, I too trusted themâ€¦just like you did.
Hold on for a bit. I will
call the District Head. Wait.
Hold on.
He is glaring at us, ma.
Let's go.
Hey, quit it.
If you loot half the money to build
luxury apartments, this is how it'll turn out.
You take contracts in his name, right?
Paramu, I am allotting him a seat
solely because of you.
There shouldn't be any complaints
till the election is over.
Okay, sir.
Hey, tell them that weâ€™d fix everything.
Make a contract for the patchwork and have it
look like a Northie is working on it.
Keep it going till the election.
- Okay, brother. Alright.
I've discussed it.
None of you have to pay.
He assured us that it would all be free.
You can write down what
are the issues at your house.
Hey, note it down.
Come.
Ma, come.
- Note down the busted tap.
Ma, come. Let's go write it down.
The Northie will be here tomorrow
for the patchwork.
He doesn't look like a Northie...
what is your name?
Kumar.
Kumar, eh?
Sunil Kumar, sir.
Read this and sign it.
Well.
Alright.
Hey, what is this?
He was the only one we could find
for a price cheaper than any Northie's.
Subtitle!
Show Kumar where the
patchwork has to be done.
Get going. Jao...Jao...
Give me the pen.
It looks like a fine building.
Hey, wait. Hold on.
What is this, man?
Patchwork.
-Patchwork?
Hey.
Hey.
What kind of a building is this?
Everything crumbles in just a touch.
-Hey, don't. Don't!
Are you mad?
Didn't I tell you not to do it?
Patchwork.
-Hey.
How much patchwork
do you guys have left?
The entire book here.
An entire book?
You're going around calling this
pile of bricks and cement a building?
No one can fix this
mess with patchwork.
And all this disguise for this damn job.
I quit.
Well, it is up to you.
Pay up 3 lakhs and leave.
3 lakhs?
Yes.
You've signed that you will pay 3 lakhs
as penalty if you bail out midway.
Didn't you read it?
I'll be damned.
Is this why you typed
the document in Hindi?
Well, you would have
found out if it was in Tamil.
Get to work now.
Beat it.
Go do the patchwork.
C'mon.
Now is your time.
Quick, quick.
Did you hammer a nail?
-Yes.
If you had nailed one more, you'd
have seen the house next door.
Torture!
No one should touch
it till this dries up.
Is it quality cement?
Was the mix right?
Uh-huh. You guys spare the builders
but question the guys who do the patchwork.
You keep bombarding
me with work.
Move it, man!
No, brother. He promised me
a job. He'd have things to sort out too.
- Whatever, you still trust him.
- Subramani!
I'll definitely get the job.
- Subramani!
Hello.
What? You fled that day without a word.
I came here to run an ad.
Here?
Yes. Could you help me out?
Come, donâ€™t bolt like
you did the other day.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on, just a minute.
Hold on, Dhina Thee is such a waste.
Let's go to an English paper
and run the ad. Come.
How can you bad mouth
the paper youâ€™re working for?
Come.
Hold on, a minute.
Hear me out.
Hmm. Here.
Is he the one?
No, no.
-Hold on.
-Don't go to him. He doesn't know.
I need to run an ad, sir.
Artist Required- an honest artist
qualified to draw THE GREAT WARRIOR comic.
This is the content.
Sorry, madam.
Huh.
Come to the MDâ€™s room.
Madam, who is that?
Ohâ€¦Nila madam?
She is the sub-editor.
Hardly anyone reads the old comic.
We could just end it and get more revenue
by running ads in its place.
Sir, we've printed more than 20,000 episodes.
Let's not let go of that legacy, sir.
Please.
What is up, Subramani?
What was that?
Dhina Thee is a waste, eh?
I was just lying to escape.
I had no clue you were the sub-editor.
I swear Iâ€™ll never step foot in
this area again. Forgive me.
If you leave, who will draw then?
This is where renowned comic artists
before you have worked.
Keep that in mind
and work.
All the best.
Thank you.
Hmm, alright.
Nice.
Why haven't you signed?
You drew it, right? Or did you
have someone to draw it for you?
I drew this myself.
- Sign it then.
â™ª In the lanes of Washermanpet... â™ª
â™ª a bat yearned and pined. â™ª
â™ª As love blossomed... â™ª
â™ª it fluttered as a love bird. â™ª
You don't have to show it while leaving.
Hey, stop. Hey, you.
â™ª In the lanes of Washermanpet... â™ª
â™ª A bat yearned and pined. â™ª
Stop!
â™ª As love blossomed... â™ª
â™ª it fluttered as a love bird. â™ª
- Let me see.
â™ª The little black stones â™ª
â™ª became glorious glass houses. â™ª
â™ª The ice cream sizzled with a single touch. â™ª
Lord Muneeswara!
Hey, that is amma.
â™ª The phones buzzed nonstop. â™ª
â™ª The world spinned in joy. â™ª
â™ª In the lanes of Washermanpet. â™ª
Is everyone fine back home, dear?
â™ª A bat yearned and pined. â™ª
Come home someday and have dinner.
I don't read it anymore.
The stories feel redundant.
Try finding a new story
line for THE GREAT WARRIOR.
A new story line?
Huh.
Hey, ask that guy upstairs
to stop bathing.
The water keeps leaking.
I told him.
They never listen.
Hey, patch.
Why do we keep having these blackouts?
It is common with these palaces.
You can light up a beacon if youâ€™d like.
The king declared that heâ€™d use
the tax money...
to build a palace for the people
who dwelled by the riverside.
The warrior was enraged to see
the walls of the palace crumble.
How did you get the idea to draw
stories about the people's struggle?
How can he even be a great warrior if
he wouldnâ€™t dare fight for the people?
Can you see that up there?
Go fix it.
So, that is your only issue in this entire building?
-Yes.
The one by your house is different.
This is a government building.
Pay up or clear the shop.
The one who wields the
whip becomes the taxman.
Here.
The money he looted was rightfully
returned to the people.
You are quite the warrior!
Ma!
- How can we climb 10 flights of stairs?
Ma, just keep quiet.
- Take the stairs or just leave.
Hey, watch how you talk.
- Ma, ma.
The warrior swirled his whip at the
one who humiliated his mother.
He doesn't have it in him
to question them...
and here he swirls his whip.
Oh, so that is where the story is heading?
Hmm.
Hey, how does Mathiyazhagi look?
She is alright.
Hey.
Nila.
â™ª Without being slithered by a hook, â™ª
â™ª he slowly tilted. â™ª
â™ª Even the gods melted â™ª
â™ª when she smiled a little. â™ª
â™ª The power goes off if she walks â™ª
â™ª past him without a gaze. â™ª
â™ª Her single glance is abuzz â™ª
â™ª with electricity, lighting up his soul. â™ª
â™ª My head explodes, without speaking â™ª
â™ª a word to anyone. â™ª
â™ª As the story goes on, even a tiny firecracker â™ª
â™ª explodes into a massive bomb. â™ª
â™ª Even the kites slipped from the hands... â™ª
â™ª and took flight as an aeroplane amidst â™ª
â™ª the clouds, fueled by its yearning. â™ª
â™ª Writing songs with her eyes... â™ª
Who will pay if the pipes are broken?
â™ª She made him sing a folk song. â™ª
â™ª With the fragrance of a love yet to bloom, â™ª
â™ª he grooved to the beats. â™ª
â™ª In the lanes of Washermanpet... â™ª
â™ª a bat yearned and pined. â™ª
â™ª As love blossomed... â™ª
â™ª it fluttered as a love bird. â™ª
â™ª Without listening to anyone, our buddy grooved. â™ª
Hey, warrior?
â™ª His eyes dazzled in joy. â™ª
Can we go to your palace?
â™ª With boundless happiness, â™ª
â™ª he was still sleepless. Ask him why, buddy. â™ª
Get in the line, ma.
Here, you can park it over here.
This is our palace.
Ma, how many turns would you take?
Just one bucket per house.
What are you looking at?
Come.
You made us pay for water there.
-Do whatever you can.
Pay up and take the water.
- Why do you demand money for water here?
If you don't pay the rest of the money
by tomorrow...
I will throw away all your
stove and utensils. Beware.
I'll pay you, son.
What's the point of having a lift here?
-This is what they always say.
Come inside, ma.
Come in.
Hey Raji, get her a chair.
-No, that is alright.
-Have a seat.
I'll bring you some tea. Sit.
Have a seat.
This is our home.
There is a room inside.
That is the office room.
That is where I draw.
Hey, how did you...!
Hey.
Oh my...
it has always been like this.
The people here are suffering
a great deal...
and you are using this as a content
without fighting back for them?
What do you mean fight back?
My father fought back like this
for the people, bearing a flag.
Did everything change?
Do you know how they killed him in the end?
I am not a brave warrior like my
dad or him...
I am an ordinary guy.
I just want my mom and sister
to be happy without any trouble.
I got to work, earn well
and take care of them.
I will use anything as a content
for that.
Oh my god. Oh no... My child!
- Make way, move!
Move, move. Make way!
Come, c'mon. Quick.
Make way.
C'mon, make way. Quick.
-Oh god!
They'll be damned for building
houses like this.
Selvi's child fell with the cradle.
Move, move.
Step aside.
Ma, stay strong.
Nothing will happen.
It will be fine.
Thank god he survived
since it was not any major injury.
It ainâ€™t dead, right. It is alive, isnâ€™t it?
Why are you gathering up then?
Leave. Hey, hold on.
Hold on, wait.
Let me speak.
What happened was an accident.
Why? Won't there be cracks
when you build a house?
Why make a big deal out
of this petty issue?
What do you mean petty?
What if the roof that crumbled down on a child
falls on elders when they're asleep?
Just watch out for the news
tomorrow about the atrocities here.
Hey. So youâ€™ve brought
people from the media, eh?
Oh no. Nothing of that sort, sir.
Nila, this is our issue. We will take
care, donâ€™t intervene.
Hey, what are you saying?
Ma, just keep quiet.
Nila, leave right away.
Nila.
Neither is he voicing our concerns....
nor is he allowing the girl
to do it. - Listen up...
You got to adjust
if you want to live here.
If you refuse everything...
you got to go stay in the tin sheds
where the workers live.
You can't even build us proper houses!
Do you expect us to live in tin sheds?
Are you happy now?
You told us weâ€™d get everything
if we protest.
We donâ€™t need your tin sheds.
The houses youâ€™ve
given us are first class.
Come, let's leave.
Why are you still standing here?
Just go.
Iâ€™ve worked in this
company for years..
you humiliated me and drove
me out in the blink of an eye.
Sir...sir...I did not do it on purpose.
No one gets to have the job that I canâ€™t.
If I ever see your signature
one more time in the comic...
I will hack your hand right
outside the office.
We can't publish news about
the People's Palace.
Who do you think runs this paper?
Not just youâ€¦no one can work here then.
Be practical.
Nila, madam.
Come in, ma.
You sure have found a great
fit, looks like he is quitting the job.
Just publish a thanks note to the readers...
claiming it to be the last episode of
THE GREAT WARRIOR comic and end it.
Sir, please.
Hey, you. We can end the story, right?
-We can end it, sir.
Well, end it and start running
ads in its place from tomorrow.
You just keep hanging on to that
old comic.
Fearless of death...
the warrior braced himself...
-Hold on, just five more minutes.
to fight the Yeman.
And in that second...
The warrior rose as The Great Warrior.
He sacrificed his life...
to save the people.
You ended a 60-year story just like that.
You are just a...
just leave.
No, Nila. There've been so many
unwanted problems because of this job...
Who will dare confront them?
No man would deign to talk to them.
How can that wretch do that?
Amma!
Ma, how did you get hurt?
What happened?
Hey, tell me. What happened?
- Nothing, brother.
Ma, tell me.I am asking
you, right? What happened?
What are you going to do
if I tell you?
You're going to lecture me
to adjust and live, right?
Hey, get away.
Ma, I keep asking you.
What happened? Tell me.
Why? You donâ€™t have a story to draw
for tomorrow?
Go on...draw.
The engineer cameâ€¦
my sister was taking a bath...
he peeped inâ€¦he hit the
mother who dared to question him...
draw this...go on.
Ma...
Come, let's go to the hospital.
Go away.
Why did you tell brother?
What can the poor guy do?
Huh.
Lookâ€¦he has brought
a pencil to stab us.
Go on.
Stab me.
Go on...stab me.
Why did you get so hasty, boy?
Shouldn't your sister be safe when
she heads out for college tomorrow?
Brother! Brother!
Hey!
He ran away!
Ma, where is brother?
He must have left in a
fit of rage to fight them.
Who? Your brother?
He would go apologise on your
behalf instead, that is more like him.
Had your dad been alive now...
he would have thrashed that
pervert black and blue, you know?
Look at the one born to such a man...
just a scaredy-cat.
Even if you hit a house dog, it would
glare back at you at the third blow.
He doesnâ€™t even have a dogâ€™s anger.
One would be better off
dead instead of living like this.
Amma, what do you even mean?
You spare the ones who were wrong
and you are scolding him instead?
Iâ€™d never been scared of having a
young girl in that windowless house...
But hereâ€¦I thought
that the house was faulty...
but even the ones who built it are crooked.
How do we live amidst them with
a son who is just a scaredy-cat?
He bashed the engineer's face
with a stone...
He tore his face, he thrashed his
face with glass...
he tore him apart to pieces
and bashed his face...
He tore it...
he tore it...
All these damn drawings...
-Ma, what are you doing?
Ma!
He worked hard on those drawings, ma.
-He should not lay a finger
on the brush ever again.
Ma.
You are right.
I am only good enough
for drawing these, right?
Your stories are all brave and bold...
but the story of me who
draws itâ€¦why is it this way?
You'd be better off dead
than living like this.
'Bravery triumphs'
Bravery triumphs!
He was a coward, who neither knew
the ways of life nor those of death.
The skies broke down
in tears pitying him.
This is the story of a
coward who became a warrior.
Who broke this?
Brother...
Save my son.
He is unconscious due to a serious injury
in his head.
Let's keep him in observation
for 24 hours...
Doctor, will my son survive?
It is difficult in such cases.
His condition is like that, ma.
My son will be just fine.
You can't go in there!
Sathya.
Amma is here.
Do you hear me?
Sathya?
Wake up, Sathya.
Wake up, son.
I will never say a word again, Sathya.
The coward did not heed
any cries and remained motionless.
Lord Muneeswara!
Please save my son!
But the coward was not aware...
that today was his last.
The doctors rushed.
Send them outside.
Please step outside.
-My boy will wake up. Brother!
-Brother!
Give him an adrenaline shot.
Sathya, Sathya!
Brother, wake up.
Get things ready to incubate him.
- Sathya, Sathya...
Brother!
No medical aid came to his rescue.
What happened, doctor?
Sathya!
Nurse, please take them outside.
Brother!
Sathya...
The cowardâ€™s death
occurred in that last breath.
Sathya...
What happened?
What happened?
The coward died and a
warrior was resurrected.
He is completely fine.
He is alright. You can take him.
How did he survive even
without a CPR. I just donâ€™t get it.
How will he get it? Heâ€™d get it
only if he had studied properly.
He claimed that my healthy boy
will die. Such a dummy.
Why did you do this?
No, ma.
Couldn't you find any place
to draw?
Huh?
Why would you go sit on the
terrace walls?
That...
My head hurts, ma...
let me lie down.
Ma, why don't you keep quiet?
Let him rest.
You have survived death itself.
Going ahead, only
good things will happen.
Eshwari, your Lord Muneeswaran
has saved your son.
How dare you all gather
here at a single house?
You'll go crumbling down
with the floor.
Out, get up.
Off you go.
Get up!
Off you go. You guys cant help
it if someone wears a band aid...
you come bearing fruits.
You look like we will hear
news of your death in two days...
here you are offering
condolences to people. Beat it.
Brother...
-Thanks.
That is alright. Iâ€™ve just finished
the patch work at the terrace.
If you want to draw, stay in and do it...
but please, please don't touch the walls.
Brother...
let me know if you have any work for me.
Me?
You'd be better off jobless
than working for him.
Aren't you tired?
Go to bed.
But the warrior could not sleepâ€¦
The dire state of the
building left him sleepless...
His eyes did not rest until the
struggle of the people ended.
Ma.
Ma.
Huh?
Someone keeps talking in my ears.
I can't sleep.
Kumar gets drunk everyday
and rants away.
Let him show up here tomorrow.
I will stuff his face with cement.
Ma, it is not his voice.
It is someone else.
He is speaking fluently in fine Tamil.
Ma!
-What is it, boy?
Ma, there is someone in my room...
come have a look, will you?
But who is even here?
Ma, I heard it.
He couldn't find any solutions
for the problems.
Ma, do you hear it now?
Do you hear it?
I can hear you.
Why are you shouting?
Tell me.
- Not me...
did you hear him?
Who?
Ma, he just spoke right now.
He is ranting away, he says he
hears a voice...
I don't get it.
-He decided that fighting back was the only solution.
Did you hear it now?
Did you hear it?
Did you hear it?
-I did not hear a thing.
Did you hear anything?
-No.
Ma, he just told now...
the warrior decided that fighting back
was the only solution.
Warrior? Who?
Ma, he is referring to me as
the warrior.
Uh-huh.
It is nothing.The doctor told me to
give the warrior pills if he cant sleep.
Take the pills and go to bed.
You won't hear a thing.
But the warrior could not sleep.
Maaaaaa!
But the warrior wasn't aware...
that there was no cure for it.
What? What do you mean there
is no cure?
Ma, he says there is no cure for this.
Hey, shush for a bit, will you?
There are no issues in his ear...
No, doctor.
Someone keeps talking in my ears.
The warrior was wasting his time.
- Now, did you hear it? Did you hear it?
Do you think he is possessed or something?
-Ma, shush.
Hey, hey.
Go this way.
The warrior devoured Mathiyazhagi...
No, Nila.
- ...with his captivated eyes.
He looks up at the roof and keeps
talking, just like this.
He says he hears a voice.
But we don't hear a thing.
This is a common case
of auditory hallucination.
The voice you hear is not real.
No, but I hear it.
Noâ€¦youâ€™re just imagining
that you are hearing it.
Pay close attention...
the voice will not tell you anything
that you already donâ€™t now. Well, it can't.
Can we fix this, doctor?
Yes, we can.
Iâ€™m writing down a few
tests.Get these done first.
Can I bill it, sir?
-Yes.
Now that I think about it...
he is right, Nila.
The voice only tells me what I
already know but it in different words.
The warrior gained clarity...
Hey, mind voice.
Off you go.
The warrior wondered if he had
to waste away the 5149 gold coins.
Sir, here is the bill.
You told me that the voice will not
tell me what I already donâ€™t know...
but it told me the exact bill
amount of 5149 before I saw it.
How come? How can you know
the bill amount beforehand?
You must've seen it.
I swear, doctor. It was
the voice that told me.
Alright, let me write down
a number in this paper.
Nowâ€¦ask the voice to find the exact number.
Hmm.
It won't tell you.
Because it can't tell you what
you already don't know.
A blow landed on the doctor
who took the warrior for a fool.
Hey, Moorthy!
-Sir.
You imbecileâ€¦How long have I been
telling you to fix this fan?
Did you ever listen to me.
Look at my head.
I could have died.
Hey!
This isn't spirit or a monsterâ€¦
it is the brave Lord Muni!
He has descended on your
child's ears...
pay your respects.
Lord Muneeswara!
Hey, enough now.
the words you told your son
are enough now.
Leave.
Leave.
Do you hear anything now, son?
How can he hear a thing?
Youâ€™ve stuffed his ears with sacred ash.
How can he hear anything?
Get up, Sathya.
C'mon now, let's go.
He is parading a whole feat on your ears.
-Sathya, finish up the puja and leave.
You think I might have been
a might warrior in my previous life?
This is definitely a psychological thing.
Let's consult a different doctor.
This is not a disorder.
Even you don't believe me, right?
The warrior beheld Yeman
before his eyes.
Stop the bike.
Why?
He says I am about to
behold the Yeman before my eyes.
Don't bluff.
Stop the bike. Listen to me, will you?
-Don't you still get it?
Everything he says ends up happening.
Please stop the bike, Nila.
I won't.
Let's see if it really happens.
- Please quit kidding, Nila.
Listen to me, stop the vehicle.
Hey...Hey.
Hey, hey!
No...Oh my!
Slow down, slow down.
Get it off, Sathya.
Stop, stop.
Hey! Hey!
He truly had us behold Yeman
before our very eyes.
Yeman is not over there.
The warrior braced himself for
a great war to protect the people.
He braced himself for a great war
to protect the people.
He is narrating stories with me
as the Great Warrior.
Huh?
If I am The Great Warrior...
does that mean...
he is my Yeman
in the story?
Why should I go to war with him?
I've never seen him before.
-Hey.
Quit calling it a story.
It is a divine grace
from Lord Muneeswara.
People pray for years, paying
penance for such blessings.
And here, he keeps whining.
Who got this damn thing here?
Ma, it is not a divine grace.
Look. It says here the magician
swirls his whip and chants the mantra...
It happens.
The same way, he said there will
be a blow to the head and the fan fell.
Now, he told us that we'll behold
Yeman before our eyes and it happened.
We survived a near-death experience.
Go on and ask her.
Yes, aunty. Whatever he said happened.
It can't be.
There is a Lord Muneeswara
temple at Kanchipuram...
things will be fine if we sacrifice a
goat with huge ears and offer a feast.
But you should not eat the meat.
The lord is in your ears.
For the love of god...
why don't you understand?
He says there is no cure to it.
Why don't you go ask him
why he says so?
Stop pestering me.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
Can you hear me?
I can hear you, son.
Huh?
I can hear you well.
Go on, tell me.
Shit, get lost man.
Sir...
I am not the warrior you think I am...
I just draw these comics.
I am an artist.
You are talking to me, mistaking
me for the character I drew.
I have no connection
whatsoever with this guy, sir.
Sir, there is a ringing in my ears
every time you tell me the story.
So, lets just end all these stories now.
Alright, sir?
Okay?
I think he is gone.
Nila.
Sorry.
Take care and be careful.
Hmm.
The love smitten warrior didn't know...
that the palace will cease to exist
before the people's verdict.
He sought shortcuts to end
the story.
But this story will only
end where it began.
Huh.
I fell...
I was hurt here.
So, you are doing this all
on purpose?
He keeps telling me
all these stories, brother.
Even today, he told me that
the minister was my Yeman.
He was right, you know.
He has built such shoddy buildings.
He is not an Yeman just to you...
but to everyone here.
If I were to lay my hands on him...
I'll strike him right in his
head with a hollow block.
the crack that results from it...
I will do patch work in it and leave.
Youâ€™re quite the brave one, bro.
You should be the one hearing this voice.
I hear a voice too.
What do you mean, bro?
I hear a voice daily sharp at 9.45.
It keeps repeating that there
is only 15 minutes left.
My hands start shivering.
Oh my...what do you do then?
What then? I go buy a quarter.
The voice calms down only then.
Two drinks in, Iâ€™d realise that
the voice meant well.
He is a good guy, man.
That's what he tells you?
He tells me stories, bro.
Hey, he tells different
things to different people.
You are hearing it late,
I started hearing it as a kid.
(sings an old Hindi song)
Hello...mic test...
Hello...mic test...mic test.
You could have fixed four houses with
the money you burnt on these posters.
Even the glue wouldn't sit...
-Brother Kumar...
What is it?
I was scared that I am the
only one who had the problem.
It is such a relief to know
that you have the same problem too.
What problem do I have?
-Brother!
It is the voice we both hear.
Which voice?
The one you started
hearing as a kid?
As a kid, eh?
Iâ€™ve made up my mind, brother...
not to fear any of his stories.
Bless me, brother.
No clue what I blabbered.
I wish you well, get up.
Get up now.
The warrior awaited the Yeman's arrival.
Go on, now.
Poor thing, he is all grown
but his brain hasn't caught up yet.
Hey, make it quick.
I am here to do the patchwork,
not to stick these posters.
It is all in the agreement,
shut up and do it.
It is in the agreement, eh?
Look what they make us do
since we don't know Hindi.
The Yeman set foot
inside the warrior's fortress.
Hail to our chief Jeyakodi!
Hail to our chief Jeyakodi!
Hail to our chief Jeyakodi!
Hail to our chief!
Hail to our chief Jeyakodi!
Hail! Hail!
Move, make way.
Come this way.
Hail to our chief Jeyakodi!
Hail! Hail!
Overheated milk
never loses taste...
A debauch will
never be a good friend...
Noble men remain
noble even in penury...
alike conch shells that
remain white even when burnt...
The opposition party men ask me...
people spend around three crores
to buy an apartment...
are you going to give the facilities
to your people for free?
I ask you, man.
Don't my people deserve
to live in such comfortable homes?
I told him that I'd sacrifice my life
to see my people live in these apartments.
Didn't I make it happen?
The Warrior looked Yeman,
the God of Death in his eye.
This will not end here...
in 5 years...
we are going to build a hundred
buildings of the same quality.
Of course you will, but we got
to do all the patchwork.
He decided to tear away
the Yeman's mask.
Me?
Heyâ€¦move your damn legs, you.
I serve the poor in my
constituency...
Sorry, brother.
Who are you stamping on?
Move, now.
You got to help me
make it happen.
Heyâ€¦wonâ€™t you listen?
Each vote you cast will be the answer
to the opposition party men.
I am here only for the people.
- Why are you pushing all of us?
What is he doing in the middle
of the crowd?
The warrior fumed in rage.
I will never go against my word.
I will deliver more than I promise.
Step aside.
Hey, drop it.
The warrior's anger did not subside.
Hey, drop the slipper.
He is thrashing the leader's photo.
What are you doing, man?
One second, brother.
I am taking it off.
Anyone can build houses,
but not with quality.
He was enraged at the Yeman's lies.
Hey, don't run your mouth.
Hey, what did you say?
I challenge the people...
Brother, let me take it. I will.
If there is even an ounce
of fault in my building...
you can slipper shot me.
The warrior did the same.
It's nothing, brother.
- Step aside.
Get him!
Kill him right here.
- Don't get worked up, sir.
Go on.
Come.
Let's get to the car, sir.
Brother, I did not do it on purpose.
I did not, please hear me out.
Brother....Move away.
Sir...
Sir, I did not do it.
Sir, please hear me out. Please, sir.
-Move away, make way.
Brother, c'mon. Let's go.
Brother.
Get in brother.
- Sir, get in the car first.
Let it go.
Get inside, sir.
- Move it!
Shut the door.
- Sir, sir, sir...I did not do it, sir.
- Cuff him. Quick.
- I did not do it, sir.
Please hear me out, sir.
Sir...sir...sir...I did not do it, sir.
The chains weren't new to the warrior.
Get in!
The man who hit Slum Redevelopment
Minister Jeyakodi with a slipper...
was immediately arrested by the police.
The frustration at the lack of quality
in the building of the People's Palace...
might have been his motivation
as per the people who live there.
Sir, sir. I did not do it on purpose, sir.
Why here, sir?
Sir...sir...
I'll thrash you.
Brother, don't hit me. Please don't.
It was an accident, brother.
I swear I did not do
it on purpose, brother.
Let go, man.
-I swear.
He is lying, brother.
He thrashed the poster
like a mad man.
Oh my...no, brother.
Please listen to me, brother.
Iâ€™ve been hearing a voice for a while now.
He tells me stories, claiming that the
minister is my Yeman.
I am not able to do anything
against him.
Who is that voice?
What is his name?
Which party?
Huh?
He won't breathe a word, brother.
I know who that voice is.
Hey...
Take off your cap.
Did you tell him that the
minister was his Yeman?
I swear I didn't, brother.
Didn't you tell me last night, brother...
not just to you...
he is the Yeman to the people.
Didn't you tell me, brother?
What else did he say?
Is the minister a big deal?
If I were to get hold of him...
I will strike him with
a hollow block...
the crack that results then...
I will do a patchwork in it.
This is what he said, brother.
You.
He who lives there doesn't
have a problem...
you are just doing the patchwork here,
why get all worked up?
You provoked the boy who
minded his own business.
Brother.
You.
Brother, I've asked around...
Not a party guy...
Just a boy from the area.
The name is Sathya.
He is such a wimp, brother.
This is not what we expected, brother.
He is just a kid, he is clueless.
He is trembling now, brother.
Look at the boys these days, brother.
What do we even say?
Hey...did I ask for your bloody opinion?
Thrash him and get him here.
Okay, brother.
Hey, hold on.
Sir...election time.
The opposition party and the media
are hunting for content. Don't.
Damn coffee.
Hey.
- Brother?
Just do as I say.
Hey, listen carefully.
The minister will visit your home
tomorrow...
the media will be there...
fall at the minister's feet, apologise
and resolve this issue.
Do you get it?
Hmm.
Beat it.
I'll get going, brother.
Hey, Patch...
- Brother?
he should act as I told him to tomorrow.
You are responsible for it.
If anything goes amiss...
I will crack your skull
open and do my patch work.
Beat it.
Sir...
Sir...
- Why do you listen to what the voice says?
Don't do anything he says.
Why? How am I doing it?
He makes me do it.
Hey, did you really hit the minister
with the slipper?
Hit, eh?
He'd be behind the bars by now.
Hmm.
Lord Muneeswara! Lord Muneeswara!
you made my child brave
by being the voice in his ears...
my prayers weren't in vain...
I'd sacrifice a goat and offer you
a feast, my lord.
Lord Muneeswara!
Why are you sulking now?
That guy deserves a slipper shot.
Hey, patch. Am I not right?
This not something to kid about.
Even I couldnâ€™t do a thing
being in the press...
Apologise to him and
try to end this.
This is for your good.
Sir...
Sir...just a day.
just stop your stories for a day tomorrow.
I will try to end this somehow
by falling at the minister's feet.
Sir, please sir.
Sir...can you hear me?
I came here, trusting the govt contract...
I am the one who deserves
that slipper shot.
Oh...are you talking to him, brother?
Tell him once you're done
that I'd like to talk too.
You are too much, you know.
Smile a little, sir.
And once again, the Yeman set foot
inside the warrior's fortress.
Hey...hey...don't look up
just for today.
I swear I'll run off to Bihar.
Please.
Give it to me.
Move away.
Here he comes,
in his whites!
Hello, son.
This single slipper is
of no use to me or you.
I just came here to return it to you.
The warrior decided to bring
the Yemanâ€™s schemes to light.
Hey. Didn't you guys teach
him what to do?
Yes, sir.
What are you searching for up there?
Get the slipper
and send him off.
Why fall at my feet?
I let that go the very day.
Get up now. The media are watching.
I should've killed you for
hitting me with a slipper...
Does it hurt you to apologise?
The warrior fumed in rage.
Sir...sir...sir.
Brother.
Sir...sir...
Sir...sir....Sorry, sir.
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.
I did not do it on purpose, sir.
- The press is watching.
It is alright, boy.
- Sorry, sir.
But the Yeman wasnâ€™t aware...
that he would hold his chest and fall.
Sir...sir...sir.
We can go to the hospital, sir.
No, boy. It is alright.
We don't have to.
Sir, please listen to me.
Let's go.
Sir, please call for an ambulance.
Please.
Let's go to the hospital, sir.
Hey, listen to brother.
Shut up.
You don't know, brother...
he will hold his chest and fall now.
Nothing of the sort.
He is freaking out on seeing
all these cameras.
Don't freak out, brother is just fine.
Oh my...you don't get it, brother.
Whatever he says happens.
Sir...Brother, don't you know.
Explain it to them.
What?
No Tamil.
Do you know Hindi?
Huh?
Alright.
Looks like he doesn't know Hindi.
Explain it yourself.
-Sir, where do I begin?
Yeman started to sweat.
Sir, you are sweating.
Please move, let the air come in.
You are sweating, sir.
Unbotton the shirt.
Hey.
-Sir...sir.
You are sweating, sir.
Sir. Make way, move.
The fans in the palace weren't working.
-Move.
What is he doing?
No clue, ma.
-Move.
Please move.
-Why is he acting so strange?
Two minutes sir, he'll open it.
Open it, man.
Yemanâ€™s blood fumed in rage.
Hey, what is happening upstairs?
Who was that?
Now you can catch a breath
of fresh air, can't you, sir?
Hey.
Sir...sir...
-what is happening?
What is wrong, brother?
I will beat you both to death.
Lift him up. Move, move.
Make way, move.
Move, move.
Make way.
Make way, make way.
Move, keep moving.
Sir, I will get the patchword done myself.
Sir, just some cement and bricks will do.
Move...
You'll be fine, brother.
Move, move.
Make way.
Move, make way.
Careful, now.
Don't cut the entire thing.
Sir, you need to calm down.
Sir...sir...Please.
I will make sure that
there are no more issues.
How on earth do you build
a place where the windows fall off?
They're asking what action
will be taken.
I am suspending you for a week.
He is doing it on the words of the dog
who is here for the patchwork.
He is a dummy.
There's someone behind
him that we're unaware of.
Find him first.
Just be patient till then, sir.
Don't be hasty.
Hello.
-Yes, sir.
No, no. The minister is fine.
He shouldn't make
it past the night.
They'll definitely come
looking for you.
Don't stay here.
Get out of town for
a few days.
They won't spare you.
The warrior prowled
around like a fierce tiger.
Thatâ€™s your limit, you.
If I ever lay my hands
on you, Iâ€™ll kill you.
The warrior erupted
in a fierce rage.
Like in hell.
Every singe time...
The warrior fumed in rage...
he was sleepless...
he fought back for the people.
I'm human too, you know!
The warrior was happy
with his girl...
he found a treasure...
will it hurt you to tell such
cool stories?
Hey, you. The minister will finish me.
Please add "The End" and be done
with this story.
I beg you, please.
The enemies entered
the palace to kill the warrior.
Brother, they are here to kill you.
Run, brother.
A great war began...
Sathya...
Oh my...
Where is he?
I don't know.
-Tell me, you.
It hurts, brother. Let me go!
Sathya!
C'mon here.
Get him.
A stomp landed on the warrior's back.
Heyâ€¦why are you beating up that child?
The scoundrel stomped hard
on the warrior's gut.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, this is a party issue.
If anyone dare get into this...
- Sathya!
Sathya!
Please let my child go.
I beg you, please.
Let him go.
Please let him go.
He is clueless.
He can't bear any pain.
Please tell him to spare him.
Please tell him.
Please tell him not to hit
my child.
I beg you, please let him go.
-Leave me.
Please let him go.
Ma!
The scoundrel dragged the warrior away.
Ma...
Sir...
Sir, please.
Sir.
Careful.
Sir... sir.
Sir, please don't.
- Where are you coming? Get back.
No one should come in.
Hey.
If anyone dares to try and get in...
you will meet the same fate.
Sir, don't do it.
Sir, please don't do it.
The scoundrel pushed
the warrior down.
Sathya.
Sathya!
What are you guys doing to him?
Hey. Stop with your stories...
theyâ€™ll beat me to death.
I beg you. Please.
Please let my boy go.
The scoundrel smacked
the warriorâ€™s mouth.
Brother!
Sathya!
Please let him go.
Sathya!
Brother!
Sathya!
The blood dripped.
Someone hit the warrior
with a club.
Sathya!
Brother!
Please let my son go.
- Hey, can't you shut up?
As the warrior throbbed in pain...
the scoundrel stomped
him hard in the chest.
He stomped him again.
Don't hit him!
Sathya!
He stomped him again.
But this time, the
warrior grabbed his legs.
Let go of my leg.
He tossed him to the left.
Why? He is hitting them.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Give me your hand, sir.
Get up, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
He swung to the left as a
rod was about to strike him.
Hey, where are you all?
Hey, go get him.
He grabbed a sack from the left
and threw it at them.
The warrior crouched down.
He titled and grabbed the club.
He used it to stop the log flung at him.
- Sorry, brother.
As he titled to the right...
his head narrowly escaped by a whisker.
He pulled the chain on his right.
He pushed the logs of
wood,threw a bucket at them...
pushed the one charging
at him...
pulled the hoop
and threw it at them.
Sorry, brother.
Sorry.
He has taken the sword.
Tell me what to do now.
As the sea breeze
filled the airâ€¦
And?
She was captivated, admiring
the warrior's skillful play.
Who was?
Get to the damn story, man.
Hey, he is coming.
Tell me what to do.
The warrior remained patient.
-Huh?
He titled to the right and escaped.
He bashed the scoundrel
and tore his face down.
Sathya!
Sir, don't.
Let's end it here, sir.
Hack him to pieces.
The warrior realized...
that his only out was war.
Forgive me, sir.
He stopped the log that
was hurled at him from behind.
He crouched down, turned
and punched him in the gut.
Sorry, brother.
Sorry.
Sorry, brother.
Hey, nowâ€¦tell it
to me patiently.
The warrior brushed the dust off his
left shoulder.
He extended his hands and gazed,
folding his fingers.
Hey!
He swirled the chain around the
scoundrelâ€™s neck and pulled it.
As he pulled the chain again...
he tore the scoundrel's face as he claimed.
-Sorry, brother.
The people rejoiced at the arrival of
the warrior who has come to their rescue.
These dogs deserve it.
Mark my words...
you will die by my hands.
The warrior readied himself
to sacrifice his life for the people.
Huh?
Yeman was waiting to kill the warrior.
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Did you see how well he thrashed him
and landed the punches?
Run. Go... go.
Hey, can't you see us?
Heyâ€¦ did you see Amma and Raji?
Check downstairs.
Hold on, wait.
Look there, brother.
One person at a time.
- Keep quiet, man.
Is the sink leaking?
- Yes.
Tell me the house number.
- 112.
- 112.
Didnâ€™t you mention your lights
were faulty? Go, write that down.
You keep encouraging him for no reason.
What's up, Kodi?
Why are you flying at half-mast?
I've seen a hundred
memes on you since morning.
You are trending.
He is just a kid...
as if he amounts to anything.
Shame on you.
You canâ€™t even keep a kid in check...
Are you even a politician?
The mock polls are tearing us apart.
If you canâ€™t do it, withdraw
your nomination and leave.
We've got many to fill in.
No, boss. I will take care.
There will be no more trouble.
Can I trust that?
You can.
Arrogant prick.
Make sure my tummy doesn't show.
Yes, sir.
Go on.
Sir, let's leave.
Sir, let's leave.
Sir, ignore the press. Don't answer.
Sir...sir...All the mock polls predict
your defeat...
Sir...are you scared of Sathya?
Did I tell you?
Did I come tell you
that I was scared?
Would you let it slide
if someone hits you with a slipper?
You and your bullshit.
Had I been my old self...
-Sir...sir...
Sir....I would have braced myself
and hacked him to pieces.
Hey, leave me.
I don't fear anyone.
Soâ€¦is it true that you
attempted to kill him, sir?
You are done for, just wait.
Sir, please talk respectfully.
Hey....hey...
Leave me...
Hey...Hey.
Hey...get off me.
I kept telling you...
to be patient and that there
is someone behind him.
Did you listen?
You freaking idiot.
I've been with you for 22 years,
I haven't even married.
Have you listened to me at least once?
I can't deal with this anymore.
I will go back to my
professor job.
You can deal with everything yourself.
Leave me alone.
What is this, friend?
Like in hell...
you kept me all tied up
with just that word.
Why are you talking like this, friend?
Weren't you the one
who created all this?
This is all your's, man.
What now?
You want me to listen to you...
you go on...I'll listen.
Slipper shot me if I donâ€™t.
Hahaha...
Start the damn car.
Sathya...
Don't you worry.
My boy is there.
Give me your hand, Sathya.
C'mon now.
This placed needed a guy like you.
We will change everything here.
We will change.
Raji, come inside.
-What?
Come inside.
Ma...come inside, ma.
Come inside, ma.
-What?
We will change.
-Hey.
Hey, hold on. I am not done
with the list yet.
Such a big deal...
I am in great trouble...
He is planning to kill me by
just telling those stories.
Hey, watch your words
when talking about the gods.
We got to leave here at once, ma.
Where?
I donâ€™t know. We could go
settle in a different city or a state.
All these people are at our doorstep,
trusting you to do something.
And he wants to leave.
Soâ€¦you arenâ€™t coming, right?
What is it to you?
He claimed only Iâ€™d die right.
I am leaving.
Only the one who hears
the stories knows the plight.
It is a good decision. Come...
Hey, make way.
- Where are you going?
He'd go anywhere, beat it.
- He is leaving for real, ma.
Where would he go?
He'll come back here no matter what.
People would butt in to ruin it
when you do something good...
you go on.
Goâ€¦Go.
Go. Go somewhere far
so that you don't return.
Thank heavens.
The warrior couldn't abandon his
people defenseless, so he stopped.
Like in hell.
Why should I die for these people?
Am I the only clown
you could find?
You'd get me in trouble
only if I stay here, right?
Come to North India now
if you want to tell these stories.
Where to?
-Anywhere, sir. I'd go.
The warriorâ€™s journey was interrupted.
For the kind attention of the passengers...
trains are temporarily suspended
due to a signal error.
The bus too was overcrowded.
The weary warrior decided to
return to the palace.
C'mon...C'mon.
Enough.
What is it, brother?
Stopped for tea, eh?
The warrior returned to his fortress.
Hey! Sathya!
You are back?
Here, bro. Catch it.
C'mon, C'mon now.
- Get upstairs.
Buy milk when you come.
You canâ€™t take it, can you?
You can't take it even if I am
a tad happy, right?
Hey...grab that window.
Let's go.
Where are you leaving?
Now that he is here, take your time
breaking everything...
I will do the patchwork then.
I will break your damn face,
finish up and leave.
Thatâ€™s the only thing youâ€™ve spared.
Welcome, brother.
Why stoop down for this boy after all, sir?
I will finish him and pass
it off as a site accident.
We won't miss this time.
Can we talk?
The boys got worked up and were hasty...
I apologize on their behalf.
Sir, thatâ€™s alright.
Each is worth over 2 croresâ€¦
with facilities beyond your imagination...
you can choose whatever youâ€™d like.
He is about to bag a huge house.
Patchwork cancelled?
He won't take it just like that...
he is used to breaking
this palace brick by brick...
he wonâ€™t leave just like that.
Give it in writing that you got this
house by crook...
pack up and vacate
this area.
Why should we do it?
This is our home.
Who are you to chase us out?
Get out, you.
- Hey!
Do you know
who you are talking to?
Sirâ€¦this will not work out.
I know how to deal with him.
I wanted to resolve this peacefully.
I wish you well.
Sir....sir...sir...
Hold on a minute, sir.
Just a minute, sir.
Ma....ma...come in, ma.
-Why?
Amma, come inside.
Why?
Just for a minute, ma.
Hey, why?
Why are you locking the door...
Just a minute, ma.
A minute.
Look, don't you see...
he is promising us a good house...
He claims it is a bungalow...
We can get it and leave, ma.
Who needs his bungalow?
He couldnâ€™t even build us proper houses...
seems like heâ€™ll offer us a bungalow...
He'll give us but what about
the rest?
Maâ€¦what is more important to you?
Me or this house?
It is the house.
What are you saying, ma?
I am important to myself.
Hey...hey...hey.
You.
Open the door, Sathya.
Sirâ€¦hand me the pen, sir.
- Open the door!
Sathya!
Are you going to open the door or not?
The warrior couldn't bring
himself to betray the people.
I am not going to vacate.
Tell him to leave.
Listen to me.
Don't sign on it.
Sign, boy.
- Open the door, Sathya!
Bro, he is about to sign.
- Listen to me, Sathya!
He'll not sign, man.
Sathya!
He has lowered the pen.
He gets that part right...
- Listen to me.
but he'll not sign.
Wait and watch, he'll come up
with some excuse now.
Even the pen refused to write.
The pen doesn't work, sir.
You are right.
Hey, I know him inside out.
Sathya, listen to me.
Please don't sign.
Sathya...
Hey, sign it.
Can you hear me?
Sathya!
Itâ€™s working, sir.
- Don't sign.
A strong wind blew.
The dire state of the house
made the warrior think.
Hey, close the windows.
Shut it, c'mon.
Hey. C'mon, catch it.
Quick.
Why don't you just sign, man?
Why do all this?
No matter what...don't sign, Sathya.
Where are you going?
Hey.
Open the door.
Hey.
Open up, man.
The warrior changed his mind.
Open the damn door, man.
What are you doing in there?
- Sathya, open the door.
Are you going to open the
door or what?
Hey.
Open the door.
- Don't sign, Sathya.
You have no clue who
you're messing with.
Hey...who the hell are you?
This is my home, I can
do whatever I'd like...
who are you to question me?
Listen up.
I am already damn mad at you...
if you ever return...
I will tear your damn face....
mind you...
Hey!
Sir...
Sir...Sir...
Sir...Sir...Sir.
Sorry, Sir.
Sorry, sir.
-Go away, go.
Is he finally leaving
after the last exam?
Please, sir.
Sir...sir.
It was a mistake, sir.
Give me another agreement, sir.
I'll sign it right away.
I will, sir.
You can't miss it this time.
Okay, sir.
Uh...what...
what shouldn't you miss brother?
-Brother...
The jesting enemies did not know...
that the warrior was fearless
of death.
You!
What do you want from me?
What did I do?
I want to be alive.
Hey. I beg you, man.
Just add THE END and finish
this story now.
The enemies conspired
to kill the warrior.
So, you won't end it?
You won't end it, right?
Watch how I end this.
Doesn't this story progress
only if I move?
I won't move an inch from here
until you finish this story.
Let me see how your
conspiracies work out.
The warrior's head...
You talk only when I am quiet, right?
I'll keep talking now.
I won't hear a damn thing you say.
Labalabalaaaalabaâ€¦.
The huge rock above the warrior...
I won't hear a damn thing.
I will not let me hear it.
Labalabalaala...
The people stepped forward
to save the warrior.
Bro, there is a rock above.
Labalabalaala...
Ignoring all their voices, the warrior
prepared to face the danger.
I am aware of all your twists.
Let me watch what happens.
I don't hear you.
I don't hear it. I'll not hear a thing.
You can't do anything.
Labalabalaala...
Can't you hear all of us yelling?
Someone tell him.
- Look up.
Brother, look up!
Look up!
Look up!
As the rock fell...
the warrior escaped by a whisker.
The plan was perfect, brother.
No idea how he managed to escape!
You kept telling me to be patient...
but now, he proved you wrong.
I should have hacked him and tossed him
in the fire the day he hit me.
He keeps looking up
from time to time...
and glares.
He looks up...
and does it.
Something's off, sir.
Brother!
He has come here, brother.
Ask him to come upstairs.
If he does something today,
that will be the end of him!
Hold on. Wait.
Hold on.
Hello, sir.
I wanted to come here and
apologize for hitting your men.
Sorry, sir.
Brother!
Donâ€™t trust him.
He kept repeating sorry
even as he thrashed us.
Oh noâ€¦I am not here to fight, sir.
I wanted to talk to
you privately for 2 mins.
Hey.
Hey, Guna...
Tie his hands, just in case.
Talk.
I was injured a while ago, sir.
Since then I have been hearing a voice.
He narrates a story about
me as the warrior...
whatever he says ends up happening, sir.
You are my Yeman in that story.
Hitting you with the slipper...
pushing the windowâ€¦not letting me sign...
were all his stories that came true.
I did not do anything myself...
that is how the stories go.
Do I look like a freaking idiot to you?
The Yeman knew
himself very well.
Did he talk now?
Hmm.
What did he say?
Go on.
He called the minister...
a freaking idiot.
Who do you dare call a freaking idiot?
-Sir...Sir.
He's spinning stories
and you're just letting him go on...
I will rip your gut out
and wear it as a garland...
and walk the streets, you.
-Hey!
Shut up.
I will talk.
Go.
What else did he say?
Sir...
He says that I will fight the minister
and die for the people.
Letâ€™s keep it your way...
Hmm.
but how did you thrash these guys
if you were scared?
I did not thrash
them all by myself, sir.
I just do whatever he says, sir.
Yeman drew the
sword from its sheath.
Look...now...
he is telling me that the minister
is drawing a sword from the sheath.
He swirled it towards the warrior's neck.
Now he told me that the
sword is hurled at my neck...
and I crouch.
He is telling me
to crouch to the right...
to the front and now back.
Do you get it now, sir?
This is how I do whatever he says
and escape, sir.
Tell me, sir...what would you do
if a sword is held to your throat?
Leave me, sir.
Please, sir.
I swear I am going to kill you.
-Hey...Hey.
Sir, I am scared of violence.
Sir...don't kill me, sir.
Please, sir.
Step outside for a minute.
Huh.
He is quite a trickster...
He hit me like
this on that day, brother.
Did they cast a spell on me or something?
No, this is different.
But he is telling the truth.
What do we do with
someone like this?
He is not aware of his strength, sir.
He is only aware of his fear.
As long as we hold him in that fear,
he'll listen to us.
Why does he suddenly switch
back to sir, brother?
I won't breathe a word, brother.
I won't.
Come.
Sir, has the minister cooled down?
He will not kill me, right?
Huh.
There is not a single scar on you...
are you just pretending
to be scared?
Sir...no, sir.
I can escape with all the
blows and crouching down.
But he has said that I am going
to die for the people.
He makes it happen somehow, sir...
only the minister can decide
not to kill me...
My life is in his hands, sir.
Please tell him not to get angry, sirâ€¦
please, sir.
If you don't want him to kill
you, you better do as I say.
I will, sir.
Even I thought that the
boy might fold and signâ€¦
He must at least have an
ounce of his dadâ€™s courage.
Ma!
brother is on TV.
You have thrown a slipper at the ministerâ€¦
pushed a window on his car...
who did all of this then?
Didnâ€™t I tell you...
my boy would talk about
our troubles to the media?
If you didnâ€™t do this yourself,
who made you do it ?
There is a voice in my ear
telling me stories, sir.
Story? What story?
The Great Warrior.
Ohâ€¦so, you are hearing the
story of The Great Warrior?
But who is telling it to you?
I have no clue, sir.
Iâ€™ve asked him many times.
He doesnâ€™t answer.
The warrior flung a slipper at the Yeman...
the warrior fought back...
he just keeps telling these stories.
Who is the warrior?
I am.
Who? You?
Who is the Yeman then?
Minister Jeyakodi.
Just like a hero and a villain?
Yes, sir.
So, you've had the power to hear
these stories since you were a kid?
No, sir...
just for the past week.
How did you start
hearing these stories?
One dayâ€¦a guy misbehaved
with my sister, sir.
He even hit my momâ€¦
I was furious...
But my mom, you know...
told me that I was only going
to draw it too...
I went to go finish that
guy no matter what.
Even then, he threatened
to do something to my sister.
I am an ordinary guy...
what could I do?
I hoped my mother
would understand, sir.
But my mom...
told me that a scaredy-cat like me
would be better off dead than alive.
My mom never talks like that, sir...
I felt so bad...
I rushed to the terrace in tears...
I climbed the railing
to jump and kill myself.
And for a secondâ€¦
I thought what would happen
to them if I were not here.
When I turned to climb down...
the brick gave away, and
I fell, hurting my head.
I was barely hanging on
to my life at the hospital, sir.
This story woke me up.
Iâ€™ve been hearing it ever since.
Soâ€¦this story saved
you from death?
Yes, sir.
So you didn't do it because the
minister didn't build the place properly?
but because it was a
part of the story, right?
Yes, sir.
Well, did you talk to
the minister about this?
I did, sir.
He understood.
He was generous enough to forgive me.
Soâ€¦there are no issues
in the building, right?
The warrior was reluctant to lie.
No, sir.
What is this?
Why would he say that?
We got to worship the minister for
offering us these homes.We owe him that.
Thank you.
Viewers, what Sathya just said
might sound strange...
that's because he is mentally affected...
I had my doubts on
seeing him talk to himself.
We trusted him on your word
but youâ€™ve made fools out of us.
...that's the duty of the society...
There is no water and
the power is off too.
There is a blackout
only at our block.
What is happening?
There is no power or water in our block.
There are exams tomorrow,
how will the kids study?
What do you expect on
hitting the minister's men...
A welcome procession?
How is it fair to take it out on us?
You shouldâ€™ve known better when you
went to him with your petitions.
This will continue
as long as he lives here.
Has he cooled down, sir?
How will he?
You've humiliated the minister
in front of everyone. How will he?
Sir...you can make it happen, sir.
Please do something, sir.
It is ringing but he
is not picking up.
Eswari ma...where are you?
Come out, ma.
Come outside, ma.
I warned you not to do all this...
he got us into this mess...
and he sings the
minister's praises on TV, mad man.
I will hack your tongue
if you call my son mad.
What do I call him then?
The engineer is seeking revenge
on all the families for what he did.
He should never step foot inside here.
I will beat him to death
if he comes back here.
The Yeman waited like a wounded animal
for his revenge.
Come.
Just for 10 minutes,
don't listen to any of his stories.
Sir...sir...sir...
Sir, what are you doing?
Sir...sir...I am scared.
Sir, what are you doing?Please, sir.
-Donâ€™t be scared. Just a couple of smacks...
Sir...
-His anger must subside, right?
Sir...please sir...
Sir, please...Sir.
Sir! Please, sir!
Yeman stomped
him hard from behind.
You.
What? Is he giving you hints?
Huh?
You want to live or what?
I want to, sir.
The warrior took a step back.
You bunch of strays...
you were given the houses for free...
how dare you criticize that...
He crouched to escape his stomping.
Ma.
Did you expect us to build you star hotels?
I should have left you strays
to die there.
where did you guys get
this arrogance?
He pushed the Yemanâ€™s hands
and stomped him hard.
Tell me.
Answer me!
Sir...
Have you calmed down, sir?
I haven't, man.
I haven't, you.
You...
He stopped the
Yemanâ€™s charging hands.
I haven't calmed down.
I haven't.
He bought back,
fearless of death.
Sir...
hit me all you wantâ€¦
but please donâ€™t kill me, sir.
He risked the life of
the people to protect his.
And in that instant...
the warrior became a coward again.
Sir! Sir, what are you doing?
Leave him, sir... No, sir.
No, leave him. He might die, sir.
-Don't, brother.
Sir, don't. No. Don't.
Hey...Hey....
Sir, please don't.
Listen to me, sir.
Don't, sir. No.
He might die, sir.
Don't. Please, sir.
Hey...Sathya.
Ma.
The voice has stopped, ma.
I will not die, ma.
We will not have
any more trouble.
We can adjust in this house
and live, ma.
Alright, son.
Brother.
Why are you here, ma?
Come in.
Get some hot water.
Those sinners!
They'll be damned...look how
they've hit my son...
did they think no one
would dare question them?
What happened to our house, ma?
Huh? Seems like they can't live
if you are there.
Apparently they'd beat you to
death if you ever go there.
Like the house is some big deal...
with all its cracks and leaks...
weâ€™ve only had troubles
since we went to the house...
who needs that house?
My home is where
my children are happy.
Hey, I didn't listen to you before...
You don't have to go
picking fights for others...
Amma will adjust here.
You don't have step up
for anyone.
â™ª Do the clouds floating in the sky â™ª
â™ª Know my story?â™ª
â™ª Can the gods on this earth hear me â™ª
â™ª Even if I shout it out? â™ª
Here to solve the people's troubles...
our brother and minister Jeyakodi
arrives as The Great Warrior.
We beseech you to vote for our brother
in the upcoming election two days from now...
and ensure his glorious victory.
Hey, weren't you told not to
ever set foot in here?
Hey, we moved right?
Who are you to deny us water?
Ammaâ€¦what is this?
C'mon, get in the line.
Get in the line, give your bucket.
â™ª Is it not possible? â™ª
â™ª Will we never see a new dawn? â™ª
â™ª If we take a step forward, â™ª
â™ª Will the winds of freedom blow our way?â™ª
Look, the mother and son are here
after we chased them out.
â™ª Come, O Warrior, â™ª
â™ª O Warrior... â™ª
â™ª O Warrior... â™ª
â™ª O Warrior... â™ª
Just till her exams are over.
I will take care.
I'll leave, brother.
â™ª O little bird, â™ª
â™ª my beloved little bird â™ª
â™ª O sweet nectar â™ª
â™ª My elixir of life â™ª
â™ª O little bird, â™ª
â™ª my beloved little bird â™ª
â™ª O sweet nectar â™ª
â™ª My elixir of life â™ª
I know it's nonsense, but how
do you bullshit like that?
He claims he is a warrior
and that the other is Yeman...
does he take us for jokers?
That can't happen...
- Just a nook or corner will do...
Just leave.
- Please, brother.
We'll leave once we find a place.
- Sister Selvi...
What is wrong, sister?
Every single day, something falls
be it the paint or the cement...
we'd be better off living in this shed
with the child than live in dread.
People live there only out of
the fear of becoming homeless.
This is our fate.
I figured we'd be okay
once we adjust and live.
I get it only now that everyone
is making adjustments because of me.
Why? My mom, you know, she is suffering
in that tin house because of me.
You still don't get it?
The house is not important
to your motherâ€¦you are.
Her only wish is to see you bravely
question them someday.
How could I question them?
Even you couldnâ€™t, right?
They are in power...
I am just an ordinary man.
But only you, an ordinary
man heard that voice, right?
Did you wonder why?
Many have drawn this comic before you.
You were the first to draw about
the warrior fighting for the people.
There is an anger in you deep down,
to fight back and change everything.
That anger is the stories you hear.
The voice is your power.
All this sounds good...
but my death is the climax
of his stories.
That is the climax
of all our stories.
But what you do before
the climax is what counts.
He could be anythingâ€¦godâ€¦or magicâ€¦
He wants to do good to
the people through you.
Until now, I told
you not to do this.
But now, I am telling you...
try doing what he tells you to.
But he has already
stopped telling the stories.
How do I know what happens next?
Why? Aren't you a storyteller too?
Find out.
What did he say last?
The people rejoiced at the arrival of the
warrior who came to their rescue.
No, not that one.
Before that.
He risked the life of the people
to protect his.
Before this.
He decided to bring the
Yemanâ€™s schemes to the light.
The love smitten warrior didn't know...
that before the people give their verdict,
the palace will cease to exist.
He said this building won't last
until the elections.
There is something terribly wrong
with the building, brother.
How will they believe you
after everything you've done?
What do I do to
earn their trust?
Why ask me?
They must have inspected the building
prior opening.
If there are issues with the building,
it'll surely be in the document.
I haven't calmed down, you.
I know where to
find the document.
Hey...
you say you donâ€™t hear the voice anymore...
Theyâ€™ll not spare you this time.
They'll hack you to pieces.
Didnâ€™t these people call you mad?
Leave them to their fates
and mind your business.
I canâ€™t abandon them
just like that, brother.
You will never learn!
Drink up, brother.
Stop feeling bad about it.
Huh.
Find out who it is.
You call the minister.
Hey...what?
No, brother.
Seemed like someone running.
Where?
Hey, search over there.
Okay.
Shush.
Shush...Shush.
Hey, he is over here.
He is cornered.
I was eagerly waiting for this.
What?
Twist the neck?
Hmm.
Come.
Hey, thrash him.
What? Break his legs?
Hands or legs?
Be specific, will you?
I might end up
breaking the wrong bones.
Who? The one with the weapon?
Huh.
What is he saying now, brother?
Huh?
he says that the engineer
will open the door himself.
Where is Paramu?
Didnâ€™t I tell you to burn
those files the very day?
What is this, man?
Did you move us into the building
on knowing all these issues with it?
Yes, damn it.
Cracks are common in buildings...
Did every building reported to
be substandard collapse?
People live there, donâ€™t they?
Do you know how many families
and children are living in this building?
The building is going to collapse
before the elections...
save the people there. He has been telling
me this through the stories.
Iâ€™ve been trying to run away
from all of this like a fool.
Is the building about to collapse?
Heyâ€¦didnâ€™t I tell you to burn
down the files that very day.
Sir...It is just a folder, sir.
There is nothing in there.
Huh, you!
So, you were threatening me with
nothing, eh?
Go tell them now, letâ€™s see
who believes you.
They'll not believe me...
they'll believe if you say, right?
Do you want me to hit you and
drag you there as he tells me to...
or you coming there yourself?
Hey, thrash him.
You wimps!
Hey...
donâ€™t you hear the voice anymore?
You damn fools...
he has been duping you all.
Sir...
What if the building really
collapses as he says?
He has even stopped
telling those stories...
it will not collapse.
What if it does?
Hey, the election is just a day away.
If I accept that I built substandard
buildings and vacate them...
my name will be smeared
all over media.
No one would vote for us.
Let the election end. We'll see.
Sir, everyone would die if the
building collapses before that.
Let them go to hell.
Sir, if the building collapses
when people live there...
Forget this election...
we canâ€™t win any elections from now on.
We got to forget politics and go back.
Sirâ€¦please do something
at least for your elections, sir.
Sir, please save the people somehow.
The build could collapse
any minute, sir.
Hey, inform the police and
fire station immediately.
The whole building should be
vacated in the next 4 hours.
Okay, sir.
Hey.
I am telling you not to do it.
Let the election end.
We'll deal with it.
Sir, you aren't getting it. It is serious.
Let me handle it.
Hey.
Vacate the people...
Hey.
Don't you hear me?
Sir...
I'll handle this.
Hey.
Get to work on vacating the people.
Hey, I am telling you not to do it. Hey.
Are you a nitwit?
Can't you listen to me?
No, friend.
Don't come at me, calling me a friend.
You don't know anything.
Just do as you are told.
Donâ€™t do anything
stupid like you always do.
Heyâ€¦what are you looking at?
Go, vacate the building.
Hey.
Who is the minister here?
You mad man, did you
forget how you got here?
We could have resolved this long agoâ€¦
You never listened and foolishly
got us into this mess.
Don't do a damn thing from now on.
Just win and sit back
in the Minister's seat.
I'll handle everything.
Hey.
Just listen to me from now on.
Immediately vacate....
What is this, friend?
Screw you, friend.
Every damn time...blah-blah-blah...
Youâ€™ve been hearing the
voice only for 2 weeks right?
Iâ€™ve been hearing the
voice for 22 damn yearsâ€¦
Stand over thereâ€¦over
hereâ€¦smileâ€¦donâ€™t smile.
Fold your hands togetherâ€¦donâ€™t.
I'll handle this...that.
Be a politician.
Do this, donâ€™t do this.
He was a pain in my ass.
Thank heavens..it is quiet only now.
now neither you nor I can hear the voice.
Same pinch!
Heyâ€¦ toss him into the sea.
What about him?
Him too.
Just one more bite.
Is the baby eating only now?
- Yes, sister.
Hold on.
Do anything to me...
but tell the truth and at least
save the people.
Why should I bother saving them?
Didn't they happily watch
as you thrashed me?
Let them die.
Hey, you!
If you really want to
do good for the people, come back.
and end this story.
That story ended a long while ago.
No one is going to come to your rescue.
The story hasn't ended yet...
Huh? We missed him.
Hey.
What are you looking at?
Turn the boat...
let's go find out if the building
collapses or not.
Hey, c'mon.
Pull.
C'mon.
Bravery triumphs.
The anchor muddied the waters
inside the sea.
(breathing heavily)
â™ª Can you hear the roar â™ª
â™ª in the seas? â™ª
â™ª Can you hear the thunder â™ª
â™ª in the skies? â™ª
â™ª This is my story â™ª
â™ª Hear it? â™ª
â™ª Are you sweating head to toe â™ª
â™ª out of fear? â™ª
â™ª Can you hear the roar â™ª
â™ª in the seas? â™ª
â™ª Can you hear the thunder â™ª
â™ª in the skies? â™ª
â™ª This is my story â™ª
â™ª Hear it? â™ª
â™ª Are you sweating head to toe â™ª
â™ª out of fear? â™ª
What?
Hit him now!
Sorry, brother. Thought you wouldn't
hear if I shut your ears.
Please donâ€™t push me into the waters.
I donâ€™t know to swim.
I guess you are saying something...
but I can't make out a word.
I can only hear him.
Brother, open the door.
Sister Lakshmi...
Open the door, brother.
Sister Lakshmi...
What is it, Sathya?
The building is about to collapse.
What do you mean?
-Please get downstairs quickly.
Please get downstairs quickly.
Hey, he is ranting something.
Brother!
Brother Sekar!
Open the door.
Everyone get down, quick.
Come outside, brother.
Quick. Everyone get down.
The building is about to collapse.
Hey, what are you saying?
I can't explain this now, brother.
Knock on as many doors as you can
and get everyone out.
What are you saying, Sathya?
- Get them out, quick.
Brother, go.
Sister Sumathi...
Sister, leave. Quick.
Grandpa...
Leave all that, c'mon now.
Quick, leave.
There is no one upstairs.
Everyone is out.
C'mon, head to the front.
Hey, hey...stop.
What happened?
- The building is about to collapse.
Please don't stand near the building.
- Who told you?
Sathya.
- Everyone, head to the front.
Go further ahead.
- Weren't you warned not to come here?
Don't you understand?
Brother, now is not the time for this.
Please take everyone and leave.
Trust me just this once, brother.
Don't stand here.
The building could collapse
any minute...
Everyone...
Get going.
Quick!
Why has the minister
come at this hour?
Yeah, and the lorries too.
No idea what's happening.
Hey, unload all the materials.
Once the election is over...
we got to fix all the
problems in this building
Okay, brother.
Why have you stepped out
with your beds and trunks?
They told us the building
was about to collapse.
What?
- How do we stay here?
The building is about to collapse?
Who told you?
Oh, the Great Warrior.
Who told you, boy?
Hey, quit the act.
Donâ€™t you know?
Hey.
Who is acting?
You have dragged all the people
out at this hour...
tell me...who told you that the
building was about to collapse?
Tell him.
Brother, go on...tell them.
Who told you?
The voice told me.
Why are you doing this, brother?
You woke us all up at this hour...
All of you...
That boy is messed in the head now...
why do guys listen to him
and get everything out?
Where will you go now?
This is why I told you
not to trust him!
Get inside, everyone.
Please listen to me.
Don't go inside.
The building might collapse anytime.
Sister, please don't get in.
Don't listen to the minister.
I beg you all.
Brother...sir...I beg you.
Please don't go inside.
Please don't go in.
- Nothing will happen, c'mon.
Brother, please listen to me.
Keep walking.
Hey.
What does your voice say now?
Is he telling you to hit me?
Go on...hit me.
Hit me.
Go on...thrash me.
Not a soul here will trust you.
They'd call you mad.
What kind of a storyteller is he?
I am a politician.
I am the one who
dictates all your stories.
Would you stay in this house?
There is nothing wrong
with this building, right?
Then stay here tonight.
Heyâ€¦he must not open his mouth.
Break his damn mouth.
C'mon, everyone.
The warrior ducked
and escaped the blow.
Hey.
Would you stay
here in this house?
Tell meâ€¦
would you stay in this house?
He waited until the enemies neared him.
Tell me.
would you stay in this house?
In that moment...
the warrior became
The Great Warrior.
He pledged his life
to save the people.
THE END.
Tell me, would you stay in this house?
Tell me.
Would you stay?
Tell me.
Hey.
Grab that.
Grab that.
He will keep questioning everything
and never let you live in peace.
As long as he lives,
he is a danger to you.
Take that.
Isnâ€™t he asking the right thing?
Isnâ€™t he asking the right thing?
You claim that there is nothing
wrong with this building...
then why don't you stay here?
Heyâ€¦I am a minister, mind you.
What if you are a minister?
You are a human, right?
You claimed that you
built it like a palace...
stay here tonight.
My house is right here, come and stay.
Bring him, brother.
Turn, quick.
Start the vehicle.
Move it, you.
Go to hell.
You trampsâ€¦ you dogsâ€¦
I should stay with you, huh?
Do you think we are equals?
Is it my fate to die with all of you?
If you are given houses for free...
you got to get it and shut your trap.
Hey...hey.
Hey, move.
Hey, leave.
Everyone.
Run, quick.
Get back.
C'mon. Please don't stand
near the building.
Head to the gate.
Ma, where are you going?
The building is about to collapse.
Don't go.
- Sathya.
Sathya is over there.
He'll be back, please go.
Please leave, quick.
Keep going. Quick, please.
Brother!
Sathya...
Sathya!
- Ma...
Brother!
Sathya...
Sathya, hope you are okay?
You are fine, right?
- Come, bhai.
Are you okay?
- Oh my.
It is nothing, ma.
- Blood...
Ilavarasi!
Ilavarasi!
Have you seen Ilavarasi?
Ilavarasi is missing.
He is nowhere to be found too.
Ilavarasi!
Ilavarasi!
Viji!
Oh my!
Amma! Amma!
My child...
My girl...
My girl...
He pledged his life
to save the people.
My child.
Ilavarasi!
This is my story, ma.
I must end this.
Ilavarasi!
Ilavarasi.
Ilavarasi is up there.
We could head up
through the stairs.
I'll take care, brother. Leave.
Ilavarasi is up there.
- I know.
You leave, I'll handle it.
Go on, I got this.
Amma...
I am scared.
Ilavarasi!
Here.
Come, don't be scared.
I am here.
Nothing will happen.
Don't be scared.
Ilavarasi!
We can save her, ma.
Careful, brother.
Amma!
Ilavarasi!
Ilavarasi!
Ilavarasi!
Oh no!
Give me your hand.
Amma!
Amma!
Amma!
Amma!
Don't let go of my hand!
Amma!
I am scared!
Amma!
Amma!
Amma!
Amma!
Amma!
Listen...
I will slowly lower you...
don't be scared, alright?
Come with me.
You go first.
I will come.
Alright?
Huh?
Come.
Brother, c'mon now.
Sathya!
Ilavarasi, don't be scared.
Slowly.
Hold her, brother.
Ilavarasi...
Amma!
Sathya...
Sathya!
â™ª O little bird, â™ª
â™ª my beloved little bird â™ª
â™ª O sweet nectar â™ª
â™ª My elixir of life â™ª
â™ª O little bird, â™ª
â™ª my beloved little bird â™ª
â™ª O sweet nectar â™ª
â™ª My elixir of life â™ª
Sathya...
How many floors are you building?
Will the building be strong?
- Yes, madam.
It seems like clay soil.
Are you laying a pile foundation? - Yes, sir.
Go on...tell them.
We have laid a pile foundation,sir.
We have only used bars
approved by structural design.
All bars are anti-corrosive coated.
Hey, what does it say?
Sweetheart, on seeing you I learnt that...
this is a song.
A song?
Yes, a film song.
Iâ€™ll be damned.
You got me working with this?
Love is crazy, sweetheart...
You used a song and made me
construct a whole building!
Are you done drawing?
Sathya...
Are you done drawing?
Yes.
Here.
The warrior who protected
the people.
It's good.
Let's continue this.
Okay.
How does he wake up?
How does he wake up?
Bravery triumphs.
