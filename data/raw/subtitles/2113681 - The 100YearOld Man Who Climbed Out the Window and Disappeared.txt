A person who has meant the most to me
in life...
... is Molotov.
Yes.
Well then. Well then go out.
Jump out. It gets damn cold,
if you have to stand and wait like that.
There's food in an hour.
So you meow so I can hear you.
Molotov! Come to daddy.
You come and eat? Molotov!
No!
No, no, no.
No, no, no!
No, no.
Pigs!
It was just good fucking.
Fucking fox.
You got eaten your last meal!
I'll fucking give you dessert!
Suddenly I had blown me
all the way in nursing homes.
61
- How are you?
- 62
Now I came out of it.
How many are in each package?
- It says that there are ten in each package.
- You can not be sure.
- It wont fit.
- I have to start over.
I'm starting all over again. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Allan? Allan?
Allan? Allan?
Allan? You mild. Where is he?
- Where is the man?
- Where's he gone?
Hello.
Going there...
Can we go somewhere from here?
- Where are you going, did not you?
- I did not say.
Going there any transport from here?
- When?
- Well...
Anytime.
Is there something going here?
Bus to Strängnäs
go about three minutes.
- Strängnäs?
- Yes. Route 322 Was it something?
Yes.
Is this enough?
No, it's not enough.
You may get to Byringe.
- What's Byringe?
- Not a damn thing.
Then I take a single to Byringe.
And you are... over 65
- What?
- Let me see...
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Shit!
Come on, damn it!
What the hell are they thinking?
Keep the trunk. You avoid it.
Shut up, damn it!
Yes.
The old must be fucking gone up in smoke.
In the basement there is the dark and locked.
He ​​may not have come in here.
We should call the police. If you do,
or should I do it? You call.
Allan!
Allan.
Many have yelled at me. Everything
from railway employees to dictators.
Where the hell are you, motherfucker? Shit!
Allan.
The first one shouted at me,
was the mother.
I can not remember that she screamed,
but she did safely.
I screamed enough too. It makes newborn
the first time they look around.
Father, I did not
to see scream so much.
- Karlsson have spotted!
- Because I showed the rubber feet?
This is the solution to hunger and want.
Call that spot?
Yes, if you do it on Children's Day
center of the square in Malmköping.
- I must warn the people.
- So is the spot!
I was only nine,
last time I saw him.
You can not live in this sanctimonious
monarchy. I'm going to Russia.
Father proclaimed a republic
15 square meters in the middle of Moscow.
This is the solution to hunger and want.
With the woman is not pregnant.
No, no children. Nyet.
This is fantastic.
- Could the father do what he wanted.
- What are you doing?
- For the Russians took care of him.
- It's the solution to hunger and misery!
Can I say one last thing?
Country Officer, country cop!
- Country Officer.
- Mrs. Karlsson.
The message that the father was dead,
was a sunny April day.
It was also the day I discovered
how nice it is to burst.
Anything father left,
came in a package.
Mother was a colorful eggs,
as some Fabbe had made.
I got such a Russian wife,
babushka.
And a camera.
It was good gifts.
Mother swapped egg
at wholesale Gustavsson.
He did a good business,
it turned out. How wholesalers.
After the father's death coughed mother for two years-
- before she rose up in the sky,
where the father may whereabouts.
So I was a little worried
for the future.
But that's normal,
when children become orphans.
- How will I cope?
- You sound like your father.
He was always thinking.
See how it went him.
You get nothing out of mind.
The only thing we know for sure
is that it is as it is-
- and that it will be as it gets.
It was my mother's last words.
Since then I have had to fend for myself.
- Hello.
- What?
- You forgot your suitcase.
- It's fine.
There is no train here. It is closed.
- What did you say?
- There is no train here.
- The station is closed.
- Yes.
I can as well see.
I was not born yesterday.
- What are you doing here?
- The bus stopped here.
Well. But where the hell are you going to go?
Must go? Well... That...
Only time will tell.
- Have you been traveling long?
- While traveling?
This is a proper case,
you are dealing with.
It is not mine.
It came with me.
- You are thus a thief?
- Yes.
- Are you hungry?
- I'm most thirsty.
- We'll be fine.
- Lovely.
- Can you find your way?
- I usually jog.
- I know the area.
- Can you find your way?
- Yes, I know the area.
- You gotta be good for you.
What the hell?
- What are you doing? What is the problem?
- We have run out.
Do you have a reserve tank with?
There is only one house in Byringe!
The light brown!
It is also a little yellow!
- Did not he just strayed?
- No, he is fully aware of the knob.
Bulb fine. How
one can run away from his own party?
I have worked hard for his sake,
and then he disappears just.
We bought a princess cake
at least 40 people.
The we ordered,
because he likes marzipan cake.
Otherwise we pie with whipped cream.
Marzipan sits in their teeth.
What we do with it?
Here I am with a big cake.
I want a black forest cake,
but it's not me who's birthday.
Call when he gets back.
The cases are always quickly solved.
Is he jumped out the window?
It was open when we sang this morning.
- So it was actually open.
- I do not know.
- Maybe. It'll be all right.
- I think not.
Add! Nursing home. They have got the idea,
I gotta get in there in the autumn.
I have just set my foot there once.
If you have taken four,
may well take another one.
I got a dime to entertain
the old with the accordion.
They sat there like morons.
- If you play the harmonica?
- Yes.
Arms wretches. Sit there.
I'd rather sit in jail.
- Congratulations again.
- Oh well. I forgot about that.
Down the liar.
Have you had a wife?
- No, this did not.
- How could you avoid it?
Peeing you outside?
I have to make room for the next round.
It is pushing.
It was good, the food slid down.
There are dessert afterwards.
I come.
Hello? Are there any? Hello?
- Where are standing shoulder and trunk?
- There are closed.
Station is closed.
- Where are standing shoulder and trunk?
- I am alone here.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Who then sat here?
- Ouch!
- Son of a bitch!
- Just beware.
- Ouch!
- Ouch! Stop it.
- Son of a bitch.
I'll kill you.
Just beware!
Stop.
- Ouch!
- Shall we flip a coin?
- Let's see if you can live on.
- Stop now. Calm down a little.
Be glad
I do not have coins on me.
In the hall there is a bowl of coins.
In the hall? If you land in your head?
- Shut up, where it sat.
- You do not say?
The dessert, you were talking about,
how's it?
We need to get him off...
before he wakes up.
I have to admit that one begins
be curious to know-
- what's in the suitcase.
How. It's the fastest way...
- It was a bit much. I'll take that.
... To open, even if you can code.
Do you drink it clean?
Holy shit!
What a lot of cash.
It is understood that the boy was grumpy.
Shut up, damn it. Do you hear?
Let me out!
- I just want the damn suitcase.
- Relax.
Seriously.
- What was that?
- I turned on the unit.
I take the suitcase, and so I daffer.
I hit you.
It is easy to be cocky,
when trapped here.
It gets nothing out of.
Life is as it is,
and becomes as it gets.
It had wholesaler Gustavsson
the true.
- Wait here, Bibi.
- Come back soon.
His escapades were well planned.
He ​​chose a sunny day, beautiful road
- and a perfect tray for pee break.
Still, things went wrong.
Because I had chosen the same hill
to my nuclear test.
She screamed in high heaven.
This makes mistresses well,
when wholesaler heads will dump end.
Test blast was successful,
but I smoke at the mental hospital.
Here.
This is your new home.
Not some noise and spectacle.
After a few years behind bars-
- I ended up at a race biologist.
Professor Lundborg.
Come on, Allan.
By Allan,
there are negro blood in the family?
- No, I think not.
- I can not get it to vote.
Allan has Negroid goal.
They are violently brought.
- But They are very light-skinned.
- But I'd like to meet a negro.
- Allan's father was a revolutionary.
- He was a bit special.
And the apple does not seem
to fall so far from the tree.
We'd better be on the safe side.
Lundborg spread out the tool
and made sure-
- my genes
was not further spread.
Doctor, the patient is ready.
This makes the race biologists well.
Give him extra dressing.
He was not so calm on hand-
- but as far as i know
operation went well.
- 49,800,000...
- Here's the last one.
- 49900000...
- And it.
- 50 million.
- You can truly count.
Not bad.
- Still can not get through?
- His phone does not fucking.
Just call away. Send a text message.
Do as you intended.
- What was he?
- He should just pick up a suitcase.
- Suitcase?
- You know damn what a suitcase is!
A portable object to having things in.
- Could not even get it?
- Looks like this may be a multi-ride ticket?
- I had forgotten fetters.
- But I have not forgotten it.
- Is it Bulten?
- I'll take it.
Shut up. I shall speak.
Shut up, I said.
- Hey, it's Gäddan.
- Hey, buddy. How are you?
Fucking Good. What time is it with you?
It's evening here.
Forget o'clock. You should have called
earlier. Why did not you do it?
I know, but I had
damn problems with mobile battery.
Hey... Calm down.
You mumbling and talking nonsense. Give your phone
to someone who can speak properly.
Mobile Charger... Okay, wait.
I give the phone to Caracas.
Wait.
Caracas, bitch! Phone.
Come on.
Who is it? Is it Bulten?
- Pim. How are you?
- Hole in it. Do you have my money?
- We have them.
- What do you mean?
One of my guys have the dough.
Tell them we have them. No problems.
Caracas, are you there? Hello?
Hello. Bulten have them.
- Okay, so I have money?
- He is coming soon. Do not worry.
My courier should have the suitcase
in the morning, or you're dead.
I told you to say that we have the money!
Is it so hard?
It's damn world.
You are going to Malmköping
and download the fool. It's real.
- Java?
- Yes.
Treo.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
- Is he all its noise this morning?
- No, not a sound.
Minus 20 .. Shit!
- Damn. What have I done?
- What?
Shit. How could I forget
turn off the freezer compartment?
Yes, you. It...
You'll be fine.
It does not regret
unless you have a time machine.
Withdrawal has never
made it undone undone.
I had surgery, I have never regretted.
On the contrary. It was a fluke.
If I had not been
so stiff it-
- I had not had a break
in cannon foundry.
And I had never taken
work there.
- These guns...
- We mold ildrør. We need a.
You can go next door for a week.
Esteban. Shut up and order something.
Si, si, si. We must work together
to create a better world.
Spanioleren Esteban
was thin as a pennant.
- He did nothing but talk.
- Make and wage war against Franco.
Allan, where do you stand? What do you want?
You have to decide.
- You have to give me an answer.
- I like when it explodes.
We must do something.
Since the outbreak of civil war in Spain-
- he wanted me to
and crush some Franco.
Why not? In war, you have to blow
all sorts of constructions in the air.
Viva la revolucion. Viva Durutti.
Where are you going? Come with me.
Durutti says...
- Hitler is a good man.
- I want to sleep.
One should not sleep.
We have to fight against Franco.
I'd rather die here than to give up.
Viva la revolucion!
I have to lift the republic flag
and open your hearts revolutionary.
When we arrived, the war
first ball not been fired...
Death of Franco!
... Before Esteban stood
and shouted for the last time.
Then came my mother's wise words to me.
The kid was never allowed
to blow up any bridges.
But so many the more
was there for me.
And sixty and dos and uno.
Now say it fucking bang.
Duck!
For many years I ordered nothing else-
- than eating, sleeping and blow.
It was a wonderful time.
It was too much of a good thing,
because suddenly I lost the desire.
I thought:
"Now I shit on this.
I'll think of something else."
Have you blown up through Spain
-
- has nothing against getting a ride.
Stop.
Why is he middle of the road?
Stop!
It turned out to be General Franco,
who was driving.
My range was clearly appreciated
he saw dancing, paella
- and a serious Rioja drunk.
It was a perfect ending
of my time in Spain.
My friend Allan, you saved my life.
I give you my favorite gun.
What a lot of doodles.
- Do it.
- Thank you.
I wonder if you can shoot it.
How to dance man.
Do not worry, everyone!
This is my friend Allan.
What will you miss most
from our great land?
Wine and my friend Esteban,
who is dead.
Living Esteban!
- What's that beeping?
- It's probably a phone.
There.
Let me see.
We are getting a lot of texting.
- Now?
- There is poor coverage there.
From Gäddan from Hinken,
Hinken, Hinken.
- Hinken, Mom. Hinken, Gäddan.
- He seems popular.
Well... Hinken writes:
"Call or die."
Damn.
- Hello?
- I'm at the station.
Is completely empty.
There's just a fairy in the ticket booth.
- What should I do?
- Have you asked him?
- About what?
- Ask if he saw something.
Okay, I'm asking.
Ronny Hult and wife is here. You can
even download your guests next time.
Sorry. I did not know
that they had come.
- Hello.
- Have a seat.
Tell.
What happened yesterday?
I work at the station,
and had passed some hours...
Now tell just what happened.
- It's what I do.
- You're not so good at it.
There was a guy who jumped on me.
He ​​was very violent.
Now you forgot
to tell about the old.
But... There was an old man.
I sold a ticket to a man.
It was he the 100-year-old.
He ​​bought a ticket from Ronny.
So abused his rocker Ronny
and forced him to drive to Byringe.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Do you know what time it is?
Yes.
- It's almost eleven.
- It was good.
So, with the soon lunch break.
Hey, hey.
- Hello.
- Goodbye.
- It could have hurt.
- It has its advantages to be dead.
How.
- Should we throw everything out?
- Drop blowing it out.
- Now what?
- He's in there.
Satan.
How.
Djibouti. Yes, yes.
He's as seen on the world.
Advantage of armor is that it
is not as important sizes.
Here. Now we take on.
It was fucking a chick throws.
- What?
- Help with pulling the suitcase.
- We're two about it.
- Hell, yeah.
Obviously. Then you take it.
Thank you.
Hey, you!
Hello? Will you just wait?
I'm from the police.
I am looking for a 100-year-old who has
strayed away from the nursing home.
- Have you seen an old man?
- I saw an old man on the handcar.
He drove past with Jonsson.
- Was that Julius Jonsson?
- Exactly.
And then a motorcycle west.
He ​​had sunglasses on.
This has nowadays.
He ​​greeted not even.
- Where did you see them?
- On the sidelines Åkers cannon foundry.
- Is it long since you saw them?
- Half an hour approximately.
- Are you sure?
- No.
Well.
Bye.
You...
Hello. Do you have room for two hitchhikers?
Hello.
- Well, it's okay.
- Great.
- It's pretty cramped back here.
- I may have the suitcase in front.
- Where are you going?
- Is this your shop?
No. I just work extra.
I am studying.
Are you studying?
Well not in school?
No. I've tried quite a lot ahead.
I have read a lot differently.
I imagine
it's a pretty tough question-
- Employment Opportunities
and such.
- How so?
- No, but...
There are just different... So...
- I would imagine that...
- To?
I can imagine
that this election is difficult.
That's fine
to keep all doors open.
Well, never mind.
- Jump into.
- Thank you.
Where should I go?
Yeah... Where are you going?
- On large purchases from the wholesaler.
- Wholesaler? It sounds nice.
- Safe? It is located in the middle of the wilderness.
- Wilds is underestimated.
Yes, it might.
Why do not you sponsor message?
It would be perfect.
Skandia's 150 years
and the old one is 100 years.
That would be awesome. As a policeman
you can get some game out of it.
- No, I do not.
- They are both old.
- I'm a cop, dammit.
- It would be awesome.
No, I told you.
I am employed by the state. I can damn
not do advertising on this channel.
70s The Police we remember.
They made "Message in a Bottle".
- Now is operated Aronsson in the studio.
- Detective.
Welcome. You have a "message"
to the population, but not in a bottle.
Tell me a little about it.
This is about a man named
Allan Karlsson
- Which in its 100th day
disappeared from the nursing home in Malmköping.
100 years. Son of a bitch.
Leger he save?
No. We believe he has been kidnapped
a biker gang at the station.
Has he been kidnapped?
It sounds like a bachelor party. Should
he marry Anna Nicole Smith?
We would appreciate
population gives us a few tips.
- Hello?
- I'm sitting in the car.
A cop on the radio
're talking about a 100-year-
- who has been kidnapped by the gang.
- What the hell are you saying? Kidnapped?
- They said on the radio.
- It must be damn Bulten.
- Now you're fucking dead, Bulten.
It's fine.
- Want some?
- No, it's fine.
100-year-old kidnapped by biker gang
disappeared from the nursing home
Tank up. Pull the handle.
You need to pull the handle-
- otherwise there will be no gasoline.
Pull the handle.
- No...
- Pull the handle at the pump.
You've never tanked before?
You have to pull the handle.
- Has he kidnapped you?
- What? Who?
- Julius.
- No, no. Pull the handle.
It says that you have been kidnapped
a biker gang.
Julius has a biker vest.
It is not his. He took the
from the little bald kid.
- A little kid?
- He needs it. He's dead.
- I hit him with a croquet mallet.
- Did you kill him?
No, he froze to death.
The little bald kid.
He came and was sweaty face.
I guess he had diarrhea.
He ​​was bad.
He put the suitcase in my hand.
There are 50 million in the.
Go! Step on it!
- He can not figure out how to thought.
- Hole in it. Go!
Benny, pedal to the metal! That's it.
- Giantess in the box saw me.
- So what?
The small bag rolled down
in the pocket of me. Will you taste?
YES.
Oh, so you were in and pilfer?
- What the hell!
- What is it?
- What the hell happened?
- I'm sorry.
It is clear that you are working in
stand, gets angry when I nails...
- He can not beat a hole in a bundle...
- I'll shit on the sweets!
What the hell have you done?
I never make more of an inquiry
radio. It ends up wrong.
It did not go well.
They called from Åkers foundry.
The dog selected for equal on dræsinen.
- Lie?
- Yes.
Benny, what do you say? Do not you
fucking on wholesaler and take with us?
Or do you try on Monday?
- What will you do with the money?
- We should probably split them.
We'll talk about later,
but we're damn bad here.
Can not Run?
But who belongs money?
It's not our money.
Someone else must have them.
Where? Where is the true?
All changes hands sooner or later.
Franco gun-
- I swapped
with a work permit in America.
You, Allan.
- Do you know that they are looking for people?
- Who?
- For the Manhattan Project.
- Manhattan Project?
Manhattan Project, Allan.
We must try to get to the interview.
- Is my hammer there?
- It sounds damn good.
- We two can create change.
- It's a good project.
It is time
someone does something about it. It is bitter.
Bitter? What the hell are you talking about?
Drinking Manhattan. Here.
- What the hell?
- You drink it. Manhattan.
- What do you mean?
- Like kissing a German shepherd in the ass.
Bitter.
- It's a bomb. The world's largest.
- Is it a bomb project?
Suddenly
turned explosive desire back.
I have to say.
It was a wonderful feeling.
It's not going to work.
We tried last week.
- A bit of coffee might help.
- Thank you.
Also no bomb today?
Mr. Oppenheimer, I am disappointed.
Nothing happens. No explosions.
- Your name is Allan, right?
- Jo.
We are solving
some extremely complicated things.
No, I'll have to retest.
Mother always said,
"Do not think so much. Just do it."
But before the bomb can be detonated,
we must solve a critical problem.
- What's the problem?
- Allan... You get a minute.
We're going to have to spend double
as much plutonium as we do now.
What are you waiting on?
We can not just double the amount.
It is unstable and falls apart.
Yes. I have been talking about it for weeks.
Listen. You get a minute.
I have pondered a little. If you submit
half here and half there-
- And then bring them together
just before the explosion.
That's the problem. How do you
it in an enclosed bomb in the air?
Damn... Do you have some dynamite?
Difficult than it was not
to liven up the bomb.
The people were ecstatic.
Not least Harry.
So Vice President Harry S. Truman.
I'll give you a huge slovenly.
- I've pissed my pants.
- You've done the world a favor.
Do you hear? You've done...
You have changed the world.
You have improved the world.
I'm telling you... There will be no more wars
thanks to your invention.
Thanks to you, my friend.
U.S. and the world need never
fighting, the people know what power...
Gentlemen, I'm sorry to bother you.
- Mr. Truman.
- What is it?
There are telephone. It's important.
I have to take it.
Never become a politician.
Hello.
A fully tanked American can
talk the ears of anyone.
It takes a lot to stop them
such as a president's death.
Thank goodness.
I'll be right there.
It was exactly
what Roosevelt did that day.
Now... here.
Harry. You forgot your...
It is a vice-lighter.
Keep it.
Harry was not so closely,
if if.
Mr Karlsson,
welcome back to Sweden.
Prime Minister Erlander
offers a welcome dinner.
When I landed-
- I was hijacked
for dinner at the Grand.
It fitted well
after the miserable pigswill on the plane.
- I'm hungry.
- Get in quickly.
He says: "Duk you, men and wives,
for now he leaves again."
I heard from Harry S. Truman to Allan
has made great efforts for the United States.
- Nja, but what a party we had.
- Tell. I'm so curious.
We drank large amounts of tequila.
I'm talking about what happened before.
No, we only drank tequila.
Harry would have bourbon.
- I think of the work.
- Well, when I worked in Manhattan.
Do not drink tequila.
You must excuse me.
Government calls. My wife, that is.
Now that's it. I give.
Tell engineer Eklund more.
Bye.
- The Prime Minister has asked me...
- Is he coming back?
- No.
- I'll take this piece of meat.
It is a pity it is wasted.
Prime Minister has asked me...
inquire-
- there may be a place for you
AB Atomic Energy.
- How nice.
- Let's start with your studies.
There is not much to talk about.
Three years.
- Only three years of academic study?
- Yes, I stopped when I was nine.
- Nine?
- Yes, exactly. Or I was ten.
No. I filled tonnes in the year
then I was nine when I left school.
Here we have a little cousin,
will down in the basement. Bring him here.
This Eklund disappeared faster
than a hen can fucking.
He was not the only one on Grand,
was out trawling.
Good evening, Mr.. Karlsson.
I'm Julij Popov.
I am a physicist. We are colleagues.
Let's take a walk.
- We need fresh air.
- What the hell, a stroll?
- Popov!
- I'm coming.
Quite a lot of goodies.
Grönstedts...
- I take a O.P. You provide.
- Okay.
- Give her a fifty.
- Yes, it's true.
It's a little wild.
Now it begins to bite.
I feel damn good.
We would like to make use
of your experience and knowledge.
- You do not say?
- It can be lucrative for you.
- Why?
- Comrade Stalin is a nice man.
I just like
to blow things up.
- I can too.
- Can you?
Yes.
Give me some dynamite, so I
blow anything up. Holy shit.
Holy shit.
What the hell is this?
It's shore.
We run out.
- Run there.
- Yes, it does.
Sjötorp? It sounds boldly.
- Hello.
- Hey, hey.
We want to hear
if we can rent a room here tonight.
This is not no bullshit hotel.
I live here.
But we pay well.
There is money. It's not that.
What the hell? Are you on the run?
I understand that it seems odd.
- Well, there comes to the old man.
- We are a little crazy.
And we hope that it can be done.
- Hello. Gunilla.
- Nice.
Time will tell.
I should surely push you into. If you do not
piss in my pants. Otherwise, the barn.
- What is it?
- Sonja.
What is this?
Hi there.
It was not so bad.
Come on, Sonya.
Is she 40 years this time?
Sonja? I do not know.
- Why do you think that?
- I'm almost zoologist.
How the hell can you be almost?
You are almost done with training...
- Where did you find her?
- In a circus.
- Well. Can she different artist?
- I do not know.
- Circus is cruel.
- Absolutely.
- I also hate circus.
- It was eksens only good deed.
He could see I was sorry for
her and took matters into their own hands.
He took her just?
- Train? An elephant is as its own.
- Yes.
Allan.
What you may not.
- Stop!
- There is too little pep in it.
It should taste grilled.
- What is it?
- French potato salad.
I could see that, but the
green mixture. It looks delicious.
The guacamole.
- Are you also almost cook?
- No, almost dietitian.
Now are you kidding me.
No, unfortunately I'm almost
very much. Almost veterinarian.
Almost economist, almost
pharmacist, nearly personnel.
So, you are guaranteed also single.
You have not had time for a woman.
No. Or yes...
I'm single. I'm available.
- Or maybe it was gas?
- No, but you're doing hopefully fun?
No.
I have spent the last 18 years
to take 920 university credits.
I've had a hard time
to curb my curiosity.
Stop lying to yourself.
Otherwise it goes through the ass for.
- Nothing comes out of nothing.
- It's one analysis, one can make.
What the hell?
What the hell are you doing here?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
- I'll pick up some things.
- You've got nothing here.
Yes, I have.
I will pick up my bowls.
- What kind of bowls?
- The blue flowers.
You gave me for my birthday.
I want my dishes.
Fuck, Ricky. Get out of here.
You do not belong here.
- Good night stand?
- Yeah, he's lovely.
He is best. Cursed lovely.
- Finger Foods. "Love" we say.
- Ricky. Hey.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Take care.
No, you must turn.
How.
Yes. No... Slight.
- Now do... That's it.
- You can back here.
- It's fine.
- If you reverse a little more...
- How.
- Good.
Wow,
where he sharpened the coupling.
Gunilla! Gunilla!
What's wrong with me?
I am attracted to the kind of idiots.
You know maybe.
Well, you're almost psychologist?
No, not exactly.
I do not lack so much.
I have taken the basic courses.
I need neuropsychology.
But it's hard to tell
what your problem is.
But you can change
your behavior.
Benny, you can fucking do not choose who you fall in love
in.
No, unfortunately.
Gunilla! It was you and me.
You and me.
- Hello?
- Bro.
- Ricky?
- She left me.
- She's met someone else.
- Ricky, shit hole of the bitch.
OK, that's a bitch.
The Gunilla.
Drop the pills and booze.
We take shit tomorrow.
's Over.
She bangs
with the damn 100-year-old.
What did you say? 100-year-old?
- Have you seen the 100-year-old?
- The old bastard who was on TV.
Ricky...
The day before yesterday I sat and turned
a matchbox alone in the kitchen.
So he showed up suddenly,
and now I'm here.
It's fucking wonderful.
Yes, one leads to the other.
But on the other are better than
one, is anyone's guess.
But I know that submarine propeller
and vodka do-
- that we get a little dirt in the stomach.
Very bad.
- Add to hell.
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
First, we would have
Albert Einstein's help.
- Going it?
- Yes.
We found mr. Einstein.
KGB picked him up in Geneva.
Is it my bachelor party?
Exciting.
Wait. I're not going to get married.
I do not even have a boyfriend.
We were told that it was Herbert
Einstein, Albert pony half-brother.
Herbert Einstein only similarity
with his brother was the look.
Comrade Stalin was just as pretty disappointed.
I think as hell.
- So now we hope you, Allan.
- Is the plant in Siberia not started?
Who is responsible for it?
I ask you!
Fools! Idiots!
It is not so good with marble,
when you have a headache. He shouts.
Who is responsible?
Comrade Stalin
will hear all about the atomic bomb.
You do not say?
Yes, why not?
But maybe a small one first?
What does he say? Kalashnikov?
- One glass, and then tells you everything.
- That's the spirit. Good.
Dance!
Dance on!
Shut up, you're annoying.
You sound like Franco.
- Franco. Fascist?
- Tree stumps at all times. It is tiresome.
- Do you know Franco?
- Yes. I... I saved his life.
Saved du-
- The small Spanish rat's life?
No, your dance... it was beautiful.
Very masculine.
Franco danced like this...
As a woman.
- Say your last words.
- Exactly. Listen.
I think not,
men to dance.
Only women.
You can not feel the same way about everything.
But the gulag is a hole,
, most sign.
But I also learned
some new people.
Some pretty shallow.
Funnily enough, I met Herbert.
Herbert Einstein.
As said. One leads to the other.
- Idiot. Put the stone back.
- Yes, yes.
Idiot.
Hello.
And the food there, or dietary...
It was miserable.
Vodka And I saw no shadow of.
Not one dram got.
I decided to escape.
The plan was good.
Herbert could move freely
without being shot-
- the guards were accustomed to,
he constantly strayed away.
You seem like you're going in
the dining room, but ends up in the laundry.
- There you steal two uniforms.
- Go to the dining room?
No, no. You leave,
like you're going in the dining room.
But you end up in the laundry.
The guards think you need in the dining room.
- So I go in the dining room?
- You go in the laundry.
The laundry? Why do I get there?
The food's in the dining room.
This is fucking unbelievable.
You go in the laundry by mistake.
Retrieve a sail?
- Do we eat before we flee?
- No.
- But we are going in the dining room.
- Herbert, listen for.
We are going in the dining room every day,
but please do not go.
You go in the laundry
and stealing two uniforms.
- Well, sort of. That's the plan.
- Exactly.
Allan, we are in the dining room.
We made it. We made it, Allan.
After a year I gave up.
My plan was too complicated for Herbert.
Herbert, forget it.
Damn. How did I do it?
Herbert, stop. Do you hear?
Try to get some sleep.
I can not find pin.
- Split pin to it here.
- It's a hand grenade.
- When did you find it?
- For a year or so ago.
- Come on. Where did you find it?
- In the laundry.
- Were you in the laundry?
- There I ended up accidentally.
You have to throw it away.
- Who's there?
- Stop!
Sorry. We have a problem.
We have a grenade without a pin.
- Throw it.
- Garnet!
Grenade!
Now it's gone.
I can say that stray rockets
behave like cats dicks in March.
The dangers to the right and left.
- We'd better go.
- Hen in the laundry?
See. We can take it here.
Here.
The fire spread to the military base.
Stalin took the news to the camp
-
- Pacific fleet was burned up,
hard. He asked clogs.
Push him into the tub,
flush him and get his foot slipped on.
In the bathroom with hog
and flush him.
Pull yourself together, dammit!
Up with the address. Where does she live?
- Where's the bitch?
- Sjötorp.
Because it is so fine on a lake!
- Gäddan, did you hear that?
- Pedal to the Metal, Hinken! Now we go.
The amplifier does not work
and the warranty is still valid.
Yes, I deal with it. Thank you.
Those lighunde. How do you know
the marks for body?
- What do you mean? It is lighunde.
- Yes, but...
I do not know, but I think
Allan anyway is 100 years.
- So what?
- Older people smell different.
A sweet smell. It's a little...
Yes. Kind of like corpses.
- Drop it.
- Yes.
Check Per Gunnar "Gäddan" Gärdin
and His "Hinken" Claesson.
- I'm busy with the 100-year-old.
- It's the same biker gang.
- Have you not read the investigation?
- Jo.
Did you get it stuck in his throat?
How.
Take some vegetables here.
I found this mobile
on the kitchen floor. Is it yours?
- No, it's not mine.
- It is not Gunilla.
- It's off.
- Turn on and see who has called.
Then you find out if it is.
Yes, but you have to know that?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
A, called "Åleg" called.
"Åleg" again.
His name is Oleg. It is Russian.
Small-Popov called.
- Is it your mobile, Allan?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- I found the derelict.
- Fucking Awesome. Do you have your suitcase?
- No, there are a lot of people here.
- Just find the suitcase, damn it!
- Yeah, okay.
- What do you mean? Is this a problem?
- No, I think of the old.
- What should I do about him?
- Do what you normally do: tru.
This is a threat!
If someone does something, pegs I
knob of them. Hit with a suitcase!
It is in the kitchen.
- Geezer, get your suitcase!
- Do you mean me?
I said fagot. Moving on.
I pegs stood shoulder.
And you remain calm up there.
Rides on.
Stop, stop.
Move away from the trunk. Go away.
- Hello?
- Where Boy, it takes time.
- Have you found the suitcase?
- I got it.
- Fucking Awesome. Do you have the dough?
- I'm checking now.
You relate quiet. Completely quiet.
Well, fagot. Stay calm.
Nice and easy.
- There is only plastic in the trunk.
- Shut up, you fucking raisin.
- Shut up with the dough.
- Good.
- Take your bags and hurry here.
- Fuck off, you bastard.
- Stop, bitch! I'll shoot!
- I'm the one who shoots. I live here.
- Hinken, what are you doing?
- Beat it, or I shall knock you down.
Hinken?
Damn. No...
Caracas, dammit! Up you go.
You yell like that.
- Where the hell have you been?
- Bought melons. There were no more.
Hinken is shot by the 100-year-old,
and you are progressing.
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like?
Half of the organization and
50 million is gone and you buy fruit.
- Watermelon is a vegetable.
- I do not give a shit.
It's not what it's about.
Tell me never mind. Are you in?
It will not happen again.
Where are you going? Stop. Where the hell
are you going? You're not going anywhere.
So stop but, damn it!
Pis.
I cut... That's it.
- Have you got all the balls out?
- I should have done something.
You should have told me
about the stolen money.
- Now, I'm also involved.
- It's not my money yet.
- I do not know if I am with.
- Jo.
- Is he?
- You also get a dime, Gunilla.
A Dime? I'm just so deeply
in the dirt like you. A quarter, thanks.
- Should I with out and swim?
- No.
- Julius, we take a dip?
- Hell, no.
- Sonja might bathe?
- No.
- What shall we do with him?
- Maybe zap car of.
- Leave him.
- Someone needs to do something about him.
It will probably me, for I am
the only one who takes responsibility.
Responsibility? So it's your sense of
responsibility to do here feels safe now?
- You stood and waved his gun.
- He was about to shoot the knob of us.
- Should we look to go?
- I bathe. Call me if you need me.
- Where should we pick you?
- I do not know yet.
Driving around with a death.
I do not even know who it is.
No, it is anyone's guess.
People can look one way, and
so it turns out that they are different.
In Paris in the spring of 68, I went to a party-
- Herbert and his little wife.
It was
with the French Foreign Minister.
- Your Majesty, welcome.
- This is my husband, Herbert.
- And his friend Allan Karlsson.
- Welcome.
No, Jean-Claude, not now.
It's you. Are you hiding?
- What are you doing here?
- Have we met before?
- Know each other?
- He got me confused with someone else.
- Jean-Claude Pistou, my interpreter.
- No, it's Vladimir Karpov.
Careful. He is partying.
We held a big party with Stalin.
Shut up with vodka, we drank.
- Who are you?
- You know very well who I am.
Vladimir had played masquerade-
- for several years with this minister.
So did the French talkative.
Give us a name!
And Ryan Hutton
on the French CIA office.
He was also a bit curious.
How do you Vladimir?
- Mr. Popov presented us.
- Julij Popov, physicist?
We had a party with Stalin and Kirov
and KGB guy Alexander.
They danced one kosakdans.
I do not think that men should dance.
But if I get really drunk,
do I feel like a snoA.
Or a pole. Pols is good.
But any snoA. SnoA is a good dance.
I understand it, Allan.
You know a lot and are social.
- Yes.
- Will you help us?
Sure. Are you in jeopardy?
Thank you.
- I am looking for Popov.
- He's out there.
Male grip.
You have come to man handle.
What are you doing here?
It's so long ago. Can I?
American cowboy.
- This is my son, Oleg.
- The young.
- Is it true American boots?
- Yes, they are fine.
- Can not I get them?
- Oleg, then stop.
- So he can have mine.
- Take it. It's also American.
No. Oleg?
- What do you do?
- Thank you.
It's fine.
Hope you enjoy it.
What are you doing in Moscow?
CIA has a problem
and has asked me for help.
So I thought maybe you could...
What the hell is this?
- Wash your hands.
- They're washed.
Then wash them again.
My friend, I would really like to help you,
but I can not. I have family now.
Why not?
If I steal secret information,
kill me and the family.
Talk to them in the Kremlin.
KGB must have something
as they please with.
Sorry.
Ryan Hutton?
Do you have a meeting with the CIA in Paris?
Can you at least get
interesting information from them?
Probably.
Hutton was happy
for piece of junk from the Russians.
- How much does he?
- No money, just...
Just give him some of your information.
Counter Espionage.
Excellent, Allan.
Suddenly I was double spy.
Or maybe just a spy. There was never
anything confidential in the trunk.
Both the Russians and the Yankees
emptied the trash right into it.
There was still high mood.
There goes unfortunately every now and then.
How do people in the Cold War.
In itself.
Hello, suitcase...
You do not say?
People often looks one way,
and they show themselves to be someone else.
New U.S. President Ronald Reagan
looked like a real villain.
He was also
so it may not apply to everyone.
Same button starts and stops recording
. It just changes.
Toggle? Speak English.
I can not grab
these technical things.
Can not have
an ordinary tape recorder?
- Mr. President? Do you have time?
- Start... and stop.
- Outside the wall get the roses more sun.
- You talkin always on the wall.
Wall remains standing.
Got it, you fuck?
You fables always on the wall.
Wall remains standing.
Got it, you fuck?
I do not want creepy creep
in my garden.
For the last time:
Tear not down the wall.
This record-
- confirms what
I have always suspected.
He is terrified at the thought of
that we might destroy the wall.
He knows that if we do it-
- invade the Russian people world-
- and conquer it without weapons.
When my old friend Popov went away,
I put the folder on the shelf.
But his son came sometimes over.
To crush the wall with a hammer and chisel...
It is shameful.
- Cheers to Dad.
- For father.
They have guns throughout the Eastern bloc,
and then they stand and picks.
What is it? Hello?
If they keep up with picking up the phone,
when you turn 100?
- Is Oleg?
- You got the phone so we could talk.
- Yes...
- Okay. Sorry.
Happy Birthday.
What are you doing?
- Take me for an afternoon dip.
- An afternoon dip?
You are beautiful as always. Were you celebrated?
What are you doing tonight?
We must obviously to flee,
however they reached it.
- Escape?
- Yes. Someone is dead, and we flee.
- Hurry, Benny! We must get away.
- We gotta pack food and clothing.
- Did Julius called?
- No.
Oh.
- Have you found out anything?
- What?
- For the 100-year-old?
- No.
Hinken Claesson has shown a brother
in this area.
Ricky is his name.
He ​​has seen the 100-year-old in Sjötorp.
- Check.
- Yes.
My suitcase must be here in Bali
tomorrow.
I need to Sjötorp first.
I do it alone. No assistance.
- I sheathed fetters.
- Get Bali into your thick tuber!
Are you in? Bali?
Otherwise you to mush.
I serve you confit
at your funeral.
Food. I do not understand.
Why food?
- It's fucking you, there will be food!
- I have food...
You get food, for we have killed you,
prepared you and served you!
Satan in hell! Not you.
I was near collision with a bus.
- Gods. Do not drive a car?
- I'll call you back.
- Is he Russian? Oleg?
- Yes, he is Russian.
- He trades all over the world.
- Do you have references on him?
References? It is Popov's son.
I have known him a long time.
It is probably,
that he will help us?
Or do you have one you want to call
who has written a thesis?
"Hunted by fucking dangerous biker gang",
180 points.
Pis, the road is so narrow.
That's bullshit. Let me see.
Fuck you!
Damn, he's running.
- What is he doing?
- Brake!
What the hell?
Now carousels started.
Damn, he flew.
- Anything else?
- A... Jerry.
- With gasoline.
- Do you own a dunk?
- No.
- Well.
- And then a lighter.
- How one?
Yes. We also grill a little.
Flesh. I love to grill.
- It's that time of year.
- Yes, it is.
Damn!
Shit and cake!
He seems not so talkative.
A pity. He seemed so eager.
Damn it!
- Is he alive?
- Yes, but he was bleeding from the head.
Hello?
Son of a bitch.
- Quickly into the fuck.
- What the hell is wrong with people?
Nail one's car in broad daylight.
They should be inside.
He is surprised
when he opens the trunk.
- Is there no dressing?
- You have to take a curtain or something.
- It must be something clean.
- Who is it?
- He's been hit.
- But who is it?
- He lies and bleed.
- Can not tell who it is?
- He tried to shoot us.
- Yes.
When he wakes up,
, he shall have his suitcase.
Give 50m away?
Do you land in your head?
- It's not your money.
- He shot. It's not worth it.
- Allan, they will give our money away.
- It's fucking not our money.
Where are we going now?
Can you call Oleg now, Benny?
I found the blood, and in his hand, I
an empty shell. Shell casing.
Popping, yes.
What?
Yes, gu you must send technicians.
He is waking.
Here's your fucking suitcase,
then you have to fucking leave us alone now.
- What?
- You get the suitcase you've been looking for.
We do not call the police.
Do you progressing and leave us alone.
- My suitcase?
- You pursued us and overtook us.
I think
the three of us should have a little talk now.
Moment champion.
The entry damnum,
amnesia.
- Damn.
- It was a lot of at home.
- And bedsores.
- How long does a token?
Memoria damnum.
It could take several hours or days.
- Rest of his life if he is unlucky.
- We leave him and trunk.
I do not give money to someone
not even know that it is his.
There is the limit.
- Hello?
- Shut the fuck up with the hello.
- What are you doing, Gäddan?
- Do you know who I am?
Yes, I know. Do you know who I am?
- No. Who are you?
- Do not fuck with me.
If you're kidding,
'll kick your ass butt.
From the top, bottom
and up your ass.
Do you think you're safe there?
That I can not get to Europe?
- This is Allan.
- Who?
This is Allan Karlsson.
- Allan Karlsson?
- Allan Karlsson from Malmköping.
You and your partner
is kraftstejleme deadly.
If you want to kill me, so hurry up,
because I'm 100 years.
You will soon stewed beef. Idiot.
Meat?
He said I was the meat.
Who was that?
He did not say, but he said he would kill
right and left.
Killing Us?
I fucking neck them.
Patsy, out of the water.
Joe, on your feet!
I need to find out who
Allan Karlsson is. Get me on the web.
I know
to orienteers are reliable-
- but you can then hear
it is stillborn.
This is a ridiculous tip.
An old man and an elephant in the forest.
Now we cules guy and suitcase.
Pak shit together!
- I want out of here!
- Relax, Gunilla.
First we had to share just above and
solidarity with other people's money.
But now there is no participation.
What do you really? Do you want to die here?
For that is what will happen.
No, I will live.
What kind of fucking question
to ask him?
- Hello?
- Hello, Allan. It is Oleg.
- Oleg.
- Listen. We'll be landing soon.
How do we fly to?
We need a landing permit.
Moment, Oleg.
Gäddan, where do we go?
We sure as hell can take anywhere they go.
I do not know.
Just say what comes to mind.
- Bali... Is it a place?
- It is an island of hell.
Hello. Bali.
Behind slaggelageret? What?
Sorry,
but that sounds a little weird.
I should probably say my opinion?
I'll take it. I'll go there.
- Yes, hello.
- You were right.
Siding had nothing
with the 100-year-old to do.
Andren issued a search
and found Bulten and Hinken.
- Bulten in Djibouti.
- What is it?
- It is a small country in East Africa.
- How did he get there?
I do not know.
Do they have taken DNA
so they know it's him?
Not yet. Suicide bomber blew
square to smithereens.
And what happened to Hinken?
Him they found in Riga.
He ​​was crushed in a bilknuser.
Your theory was the fact that he was shot
in Sjötorp. We found blood.
- It was the elephant blood.
- Elephant Blood...
Hinken had no bullet wounds,
only crush injuries from the machine.
Lfølge technicians were only elephant blood in Sjötorp.
Gäddan And where did he go?
Nothing connects him to the 100-year-old.
The call is not our table.
- So we have nothing to anyone?
- No, certainly nothing criminal.
This is incredible.
The 100-year-old standing in front of me.
And an elephant.
Son of a bitch. Then ask if he
will run back to the nursing home.
No way. Zero.
- Just drop the whole thing.
- Okay, I get it.
- I will not let it.
- I must nevertheless say that you...
You have made it damn well.
I'll see you on Monday.
See you on Monday. Goodbye.
- Av. It is very tight.
- It should be tight.
- To stop the blood flow.
- Then do it yourself.
No, you should do it,
even though you are fucking bad at it.
100-year-old still missing
- Hello?
- Well, you're alive?
- Where the hell are you?
- Bali.
Bali? Now are you fucking kidding me.
- What?
- What do you mean? Hello?
- Allan Karlsson is in the other car.
- Who?
Patsy, look to the left.
This is Allan Karlsson with my suitcase.
Why we draw people towards the sea?
I guess the feeling of freedom.
Do something. Run into the car.
What a blast.
Bali is a beautiful island.
Hello? Are you still on the phone?
Holy shit.
Ja...
- Have you already got malaria?
- What?
- You're pale as a sheet.
- No.
There's just a bit of chaos right now.
I do not know.
What the hell. She will have to have you.
I know. That's just it.
It's starting to get serious now.
I have to like my mind.
I'll get another spin.
- It is not just anybody.
- What do you mean?
I think that having it as you.
It's getting vouchsafed.
Now go up to her and say it.
- That it is not just anybody?
- No. You mess indeed around in it.
Now go there.
I understand what you mean.
I was thinking about that...
Yes, it's not just anybody,
as I said.
You never know.
There is also a day in the morning.
- What did you say to him, Allan?
- Why she shouts at you?
There are many,
who yelled at me in my time.
Everything from railway employees
dictators.
The first one shouted at me
my mother.
I do not remember that she screamed,
but she did safely.
I screamed probably is.
This makes the newborn for the first time,
they look around.
