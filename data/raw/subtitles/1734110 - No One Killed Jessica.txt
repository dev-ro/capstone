Delhi...
1999
One year ago India had
conducted a nuclear test...
and joined the nuclear power club.
The world was moving
into the new millennium.
And, I'd just begun reporting
for a news channel.
I was posted in Delhi.
Delhi... the city where I was born.
Where I grew up.
The city I never understood.
If Mumbai is about money...
then Delhi is about power.
Connections...
Influences...
Contacts...
Without these
any application is futile.
And every fight is about...
who you are.
Everybody is someone in Delhi.
Nobody is a nobody.
Are these pearls of wisdom
or an over-simplification...
I'm not sure.
So, I tried to
understand Delhi my way.
I failed.
I wondered if Delhi was
like any other metropolis.
But the more I learnt,
the less I understood.
Finally, I gave up trying.
Delhi was gearing up for
the summer with water coolers.
And for the Cricket
world cup with TV sets.
But then the spotlight moved
from cricket and the heat...
to another big event.
The Pakistani army and
militants seized the Kargil peaks.
The Indian government launched
a major military
operation to reclaim Kargil.
The Kargil war had begun.
Indians wore
patriotism on their sleeves.
Victory to India!
In the past cricket
united the country...
and now the war.
I went to Kargil.
I was reporting from Kargil
when another incident took place.
Something that would change the
face of politics and power in Delhi.
Hello...
Who is it.
One second.
Sabrina...
It's Dileep on the line...
he says its urgent.
Okay, mom.
- Hello? - Sabrina, Dileep here.
Dileep, it's two a.m.
Sabrina, Jessica is hurt,
come quickly.
What do you mean she is hurt?
She has hurt herself.
She keeps hurting herself.
Take her to a doctor.
She will be okay.
I can't come now.
Anyway you are all with her.
Sabrina, it's a bullet wound.
What do you mean?
She has been shot.
What!
Sabrina, Dilip is here.
- Where is she?
Where is she, Dilip? Dilip,
where is she?
Sabrina. - How is she?
- Sabrina, she will be fine.
How is she?
- Just relax.
What happened?
- Sabrina, just relax.
- How did this happen?
- Just be cool.
- How can someone shoot her
just like that - Don't panic.
- Sabrina, relax.
- Weren't you all there?
- Why didn't you do something?
- We weren't there.
- You didn't do anything?
- Sabrina, relax.
- It happened so quickly.
- Shot with a bullet...
was it a fight?
How did this happen?
- But...
- Sabrina, listen.
- But how could someone walk in
with a gun?
Vikram Jaisingh was there.
- Where is he?
I saw her down... She was down, sir.
I... I... I couldn't do anything.
This guy... This crazy rogue...
He just... He just came and... He just...
Go ahead... go on.
Vikram?
Vikram...
Vikram.
- They came...
- Look at me.
- Poor Jess.
What happened?
He pulled out his gun and
he just shot her. - Who?
He just shot her. I swear...
- Who? Who shot at her?
Vikram... what happened?
They asked for drinks.
Vikram, how did it happen?
- I said we were out of drinks.
Who shot her? Look at me. Vikram.
He pulled out the gun.
Look at me, Vikram.
He just shot her.
Vikram!
How did this happen?
Who shot at her?
Ladies and gentlemen, coming
up is your last track for night.
Ladies and gentlemen, so go on
until you get the power. So get set...
Go.
- Go.
Hi, Jess.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope
you're having a fabulous time.
Well now give it up
to... 'Lust for Life'.
Jess, come on. Hurry up!
- Jess, aren't you coming
for coffee? - In ten minutes.
- You coming?
- No, have to go to college tomorrow.
Come on. - Jess, I'm really tired.
Don't irritate now.
Ya.
Your daughter is so thin.
So she is.
Your place is lovely.
The best in town.
- I know. I know.
Peter...
Peter! This is my husband Peter.
Hi, Peter!
- Peter, this is Bernard.
Chairman of the YCM Group.
Thank you. Cheers! - You guys
are having a good time? - Ya.
Alright. Alright.
It's crazy... - You know this guy?
He's gonna burn the ramp next year.
Vikram, meet Elton, Reena...
- Hi! - Hi!
If you want to walk
the ramp in Delhi...
these are the guys.
I'll keep that in mind... Excuse me!
- Jess... Jessica...
- What?
Who are those guys?
I have no idea.
Yeah... - Rahul! - One sec. One sec.
I'm not a genie or something.
Albert.
- Ya. - Pass an orange juice.
Jessica, so finally you have
decided to marry me. - Shut up!
- How many coupons do
you have? - Two... why?
Drinks finishing you
may not get them later.
Oh! You're out of drinks?
Here. Enjoy this.
- I love you, Jess.
Shut up!
- Still love you.
Now don't you tell me the
drinks are over. - Over.
No.
- Yes.
No.
- Yes. Come on.
Jess, come on. Please. Please.
You always save the last one for me.
Come on. Please.
Please.
I knew it. I love you.
Please...
- Everybody loves you.
Now what?
Cleaning up, what else?
- We want drinks.
Sorry, sir, bar is closed.
I'm sure you will have
something somewhere.
Sorry, guys. The drinks are over.
- Exactly, sir. Really sorry.
Come on, Jess. We have lots to do.
You served everyone else.
Hey, Dileep!
Watch it pal!
What are you doing?
We didn't get a drink,
while you have two!
Anyway, carry on.
Mallika, your restaurant...
your parties, they're just too good.
Sweetheart, this is nothing.
Wait and see. It's going
to get bigger and better.
O my God! It's totally wild
out there. - Ya. Just like you.
I'm starving. Please
give me something to eat.
Behind the counter.
- What? - Look, you will find it.
Peanuts?
- That's what I get paid.
Peanuts.
- Vikram, please...
- Hey there... pour us
a few drinks as well.
- I already told you,
drinks are over.
Come on...
Here...
take this and give us the drinks.
Please, you must be kidding!
We're out of drinks.
Sir, seriously...
Enough!
Don't try to 'sir' me!
We want the drinks.
He told you...
we're out of drinks.
Why don't you give us yours?
You know, I wouldn't even let
you have a sip of my drink...
for your thousand bucks.
Can I have a sip of you
for whatever you want?
Sir, that's enough.
We are completely out of drinks.
Now, you listen to me!
Take this and give us the drinks.
Come on, do it.
- What's the problem here?
Nothing at all, we want drinks.
We told you outside
the drinks are over.
How many times do we tell you?
Don't you get it?
No, I don't.
Stop it! I said stop it!
What the hell is this!
Don't you understand?
Just get out of here.
What did you say?
I say get out.
What?
I say get out.
Skank!
Now, will I get a drink?
Now?
I told you we're out of drinks.
- Come on, let it be.
Now?
Now?
- Put the gun away.
Now?
- Put the gun away.
Yes or no?
Put the gun away.
Now!
I said the drinks...
You idiot, what did you do?
You shot her.
I didn't do it.
- Why did you shoot her?
You shot her.
Why did you shoot her?
Why did you shoot her?
I... I didn't do it.
Lucky... run away...
Run... now!
- Give me the gun!
- I didn't shoot her.
Peter. Peter. Peter.
Stop that man. He has a gun.
- What happened?
- Sorry...
Somebody shot Jessica.
Somebody shot Jessica.
Somebody shot Jessica.
He shot her...
because she refused
to give him a drink?
Take down his statement for
the FIR and get him to sign.
Sir, right now?
Where is my baby?
- Jess.
Where is my baby?
- Mom. Mom.
She'll be fine.
- I'll just go and see her.
Mom, she'll be fine.
- I want to...
- She will be fine, mom.
Mom, she'll be fine.
She will be fine.
I will...
- Mom, she will be fine.
We need to take the
patient to AIIMS hospital.
Now!
She is gone.
Jessica is gone.
- No, Sabrina, she will be fine.
She is gone.
She's stopped breathing.
Hello, we are rolling
Meera, you are live.
You are on air.
Pakistani soldiers and
militants have been...
Beaten back by the Indian army.
After a month and half long war...
the Indian army has
reclaimed Tiger Hill.
On one hand...
there is joy and victory,
on the other...
there is despair for the martyrs.
Of course, it is sad.
Be it our soldiers or theirs.
We are all human.
We are soldiers.
We wear this uniform
to protect our country.
In a war, you either
kill or get killed.
Victory to India!
Victory to India!
We kill by profession.
Not by choice.
If we don't kill them,
they will kill us.
This war that raged
for a month and a half...
claimed the lives of
countless Indian...
and Pakistani soldiers.
Both countries are now
faced with a critical question.
Was this war necessary?
Reporting from
Kargil for the last time...
with cameraman Mitul Dixit...
this is Meera Gaiti, for NDTV.
Excuse me!
- Yes, ma'am.
Can I have a newspaper please?
Sure, ma'am. I'll just get it.
Excuse me!
I've seen you somewhere.
Right, on TV!
You're really something!
Hi, I'm Anuj.
Hello!
I've never experienced
war like this.
It was amazing...
It was like watching
an action film.
It was so exciting.
Huge weapons, wide-gauge tanks...
rockets, airplanes, bunkers...
and the bodies of our soldiers.
I am sure you enjoyed that as well.
I mean...
If you were there...
you would've been shitting bricks.
Excuse me! What did you say?
If you were there you
would've been shitting bricks.
Enjoyed it... nonsense!
Excuse me, ma'am! Your newspaper.
Thank you.
He is at the Manali guest-house.
It is safe...
but not for long.
You've seen the newspaper reports.
He is young, it was an accident.
Remember when we were young?
This is no fun and games,
he has killed someone.
Do whatever it takes,
but save my Monu.
What are you thinking about?
He is our own.
Your son or mine...
I know it's painful.
Who was the girl?
Some small-time model.
She went and died
but dug a grave for us.
- What is this?
- See for yourself.
Tell me.
Open it and see.
You got a job?
As an assistant manager.
That too in Dubai!
India doesn't deserve me, babes.
Yeah, sure! When do you join?
Next month.
Did you tell mom and dad?
You will tell them.
You'll tell them and convince them.
Very smart.
Okay, I got to go.
You're coming for the party tonight?
No, I'm not coming.
Why not?
I get bored.
Shut up, come for a little while.
I'll make a sexy cocktail for you.
But I don't drink.
Virgin.
What did you say?
I was talking about the cocktail.
Jess... I'll get you!
See you girls at the party.
And bring the prude.
This prude isn't coming.
- I'll see you at home
in the morning.
Lord Jesus...
You alone are holy
and compassionate.
Forgive our sister her sins.
In death you open the gates of
life for those who believe in you.
Do not let our sister be
parted from you, Lord.
But by your glorious power give
her life, joy and peace in heaven...
where you live
forever and ever. Amen!
Amen!
Dad, now don't start
crying like grandma.
Here I don't have time for
a boyfriend and...
you're talking marriage.
Yes, dad, I'll visit soon,
I promise.
Ok, dad, now don't bore me.
I've to go, dad. Bye. Love you.
Meera, marry me!
Your girlfriend says
you're lousy in bed.
Try me.
- Try this.
- You're a celebrity now.
Great work. Congratulations!
Thank you.
I wanted to see you.
I wanted to talk to you about...
- Vacation?
Raise? Cabin?
My new assignment.
What would you like to do?
What would you like me to do?
What about this?
These days even Hindi film
politicians aren't villains.
He's not gonna get away.
There are about 300
eyewitnesses or so.
- And not just anyone.
Models... bureaucrats.
Celebrities... police officers.
It's an open and shut case.
He's gone.
It's a very big story.
There is a lot of
public interest in it.
This is Crime Beat stuff.
Why don't you let
Rajesh Roy cover it?
He even looks like a criminal.
I think I deserve a much
bigger and better story.
Come on, Meera! To
match your profile...
India is not going
to fight another war.
I haven't declared
myself a war correspondent.
But I get the feeling that
my profile is being lowered.
Oh! You are such a witch,
Meera. You know that?
Of course I know.
What else did you think I was?
- Check out the news quick.
Manish Bhardwaj has
been arrested. It's live.
The witch is always right.
- Manish Bhardwaj has surrendered
himself at the Chandigarh court.
- Police have taken him
into custody.
- He is being taken to
Delhi for questioning.
We would like to
tell our viewers that...
Manish Bhardwaj's
father Pramod Bhardwaj is...
a minister in the Haryana cabinet.
When Pramod Bhardwaj was
questioned about this matter.
Look...
he is being framed.
I have full trust
in the legal system.
The truth will be out.
My son is innocent.
What if he isn't?
He will be.
Pramod Bhardwaj just said that
his son, Manish is innocent.
- June! - Mom?
The truth will be out when
the court gives it's verdict.
Listen...
Mom.
let's ask B. R.
Pandit to fight the case.
He is a well known criminal lawyer.
He has fought many such cases.
He has a 95 % success rate.
And the other?
Who?
The lawyer...
with the 100 % success rate.
Oh, Shyam Tolani?
He's retired.
He doesn't fight cases anymore.
He will, ask him his price.
We asked...
but he didn't budge.
Do whatever it takes,
but I want my Monu.
Sir, I was furious.
I was ready to pay a thousand bucks.
But she refused to give me a drink.
Did you know her?
No.
Then?
Sir...
then I...
I pulled out my gun.
Which one?
.22 bore, Italian Barreta.
When did you buy it?
Sir...
four months ago from Ambala.
Sir, I only wanted to scare her.
Nobody said a word.
I wanted to fire two
inches from her ear.
You wanted to fire two
inches from her ear?
Yes.
You wear spectacles, right?
Did you wear them that night?
No, sir.
Look here...
how many inches is this from my ear?
Bloody b******.
Two inches from her ear?
Go on.
What happened next?
Listen...
don't be scared.
We are with you.
Mistakes happen.
Mistakes happen, right?
Now talk.
Now!
Listen...
I've been paid not to hit you.
Lots.
But if you don't talk...
my hand will do the talking.
So... you fired the bullet
two inches from her ear.
Okay?
Then what happened?
Tell me.
Sir... then I fled from there.
I think she's dead.
Who was she?
Some Jessica.
We're dead.
Vishal... we'll get screwed.
Real bad.
My car is still there.
Bloody hell, we are screwed.
My car... it's still there.
Wait here... stay here.
Lucky and I will bring it back.
Stay here. Come on Lucky...
Come on!
Vishal...
my pistol...
I hid it nearby.
Where?
Come on.
Come on, Lucky.
Sir...
It was almost dawn...
We drove back to Lucky's house.
Sir, the deputy wants to see you.
Didn't you tell him, I'm busy?
I did, but he insisted.
Coming.
Go on, take a break.
The police have arrested
two more suspects in...
connection with the Jessica case.
Vishal Rastogi...
son of U.P. minister R. D. Rastogi.
Lucky Singh...
an MBA and a resident of Delhi.
Police have also confiscated the
car in which the suspects fled
While combing through the car...
the police also
recovered a live cartridge.
Which is being
treated as prime evidence.
Police had found two similar
.22 bore shell casings at Keno's.
One bullet hit the roof...
and the other bullet hit Jessica.
All three are from the same pistol...
which was most likely
used to shoot Jessica.
Just a minute... Just a minute...
Just a minute... let me speak...
let me speak... Just a minute...
We still haven't
found the murder weapon.
Which is a .22 bore pistol.
Sir, do you have
any other evidence?
Yes, there is a lot of
circumstantial evidence.
Police have arrested the suspects...
what are your comments?
My sister has been murdered.
And...
my family and I...
we believe...
and hope...
that the culprit will be punished...
and justice will prevail.
He is the son... just a minute!
He is the son of a
powerful politician.
Are you afraid that
he might go scot free?
No!
Ma'am... Ma'am...
You never say anything to
Meera didi.
Nobody can say anything to Meera.
But, where is she?
I don't know.
Sometimes we don't value things...
as much as we should.
Actors refuse a classic
thinking it isn't a great story.
People don't invest in an insurance
scheme thinking it might be a scam.
Young boys and girls are
so enamoured by a stranger...
that they fail to
recognize their soulmate.
Similarly, a
journalist ignores an incident...
thinking there's no story in it.
Something similar happened to me.
I thought it was a
run-of-the-mill story.
Not a milestone in the
history of a new India.
Sabrina...
you better be alert.
Do you know who you are up against?
What do you mean by that?
He murdered my sister
in front of everyone.
I know it.
You know it, the police know it...
And the 300 people there...
Only seven people.
Nobody else was there.
Are you joking?
It is a joke.
I despise your
'high-society' people.
I'm tired asking them...
over and over...
"Were you at Keno's that night?"
I left at midnight.
It was my wife's birthday.
Uncle, I left at midnight.
I had exams.
I had to go to the
college in the morning.
I swear.
Sir, I left before the firing.
I guess around midnight.
I left at 12 O' clock.
Actually, we left.
Me and my boyfriend
had a plan, so you know...
we had to leave.
Were you at the party?
12 O' clock I was out.
You see, my husband was
coming from Singapore that day.
Business meeting.
So I remember leaving at
12 O' clock to pick him up.
It's too hot in here.
How do you people work?
Can you please at
least turn on the AC?
Were you at Keno's that night?
I had left the place.
- I guess around... - Midnight?
I'm sure you left at midnight.
If I was there, I wouldn't
have let the a******* escape.
No, sir, we weren't drinking.
Did I ask you?
If you drank water...
or a coke...
or juice...
Did I ask?
No, we never drank anything.
We left at midnight...
Enough!
Not one word!
You tell me.
When everybody...
all 300 left at midnight...
were there ghosts
dancing at the party?
How can you hang out
with such people, Sabrina?
What kind of people are these?!
A girl lost her life and...
Here...
this file contains the
names of seven witnesses...
and their statements.
Vikram.
He saw the bullet being fired.
And lodged the FIR.
Yes.
It was him.
Take a closer look.
Yes.
He shot Jessica.
Don't worry,
it's merely a formality.
Sir...
Only these seven people...
have told us
what happened that night.
- Okay? - Okay.
They are our prime witnesses.
The case will be presented
before the court for a hearing.
But if one of them
lies for any reason...
Then anything can happen.
What do you mean,
anything can happen?
What do you think I mean...
use your imagination.
Go on.
Well, ma'am...
I want to do what is right.
I am poor, with a wife
and two little kids.
I don't want to get into a mess.
Try to understand my plight.
What about my plight?
My sister is no more.
Just tell the court what you saw.
Only because you were there.
What about
the other 300 people there?
Please... excuse me.
I can't do this.
Is someone threatening you?
Who is it?
One witness is dealt with.
What about the others?
They will come around too.
Sir, they are being threatened.
They would complain if
they were threatened.
And the police would
provide protection.
What about protecting our witnesses?
But we don't have a witness
protection programme in India.
We follow a procedure.
If we receive a complaint...
we will take action.
How do you expect us to Take
action without a complaint?
Even then we will keep a watch.
That's Mr. Saxena, the prosecution
lawyer And a good friend too.
Hello!
- He has promised to do his best.
Ms. Sabrina...
witness tampering is quite normal.
But don't be worried about it.
We have a strong case.
I have a feeling that boy...
will go free.
No.
How can he go free?
I mean, how can he be set free?
Honour is...
My honour is still alive.
I will tell the truth.
I told the police...
I will tell the court as well.
I swear, don't worry.
I hadn't lost hope.
But you've given me courage.
Thank you.
Why do you say that?
She was your sister, she
could've been mine too.
Your tea.
As I was saying, Ms. Sabrina...
I have...
This problem.
If you could...
I mean...
Go on...
tell me.
You see...
He said he wants to
tell the truth in court.
Dad...
of all the people present
that night...
He is the poorest and
most vulnerable.
That's why...
I understand, my dear.
Hello, sir.
We...
don't have 50,000 rupees right now.
Here's 20,000.
It's okay, this will do.
I shall take the rest later.
- Mr. Dharam... - Yes?
We gave you the money...
because you needed it.
Please only tell the truth
in court.
Not for me or anyone else.
I will, madam.
I will tell the truth.
I swear, I will.
I don't know about mum,
but Sabrina...
I am with you.
I want that man punished.
I don't know, Sabrina.
Thank you.
I saw him...
and yet in a way, I didn't.
I'm not sure. I don't know.
I'm so confused.
But Jess... Poor Jess.
You want some?
You now what, Mallika...
she adored you.
Vikram.
Everything hinges on his testimony.
Vikram is their star witness.
He registered the FIR.
If Vikram identifies Manish
in court...
then no lawyer in the
world can help your son.
I'll take care of him, Mr. Pandit.
I shall prepare
each witness for you.
You look after the trial.
Leave the witnesses...
to me.
Then it comes down to...
the ballistics report.
What's the progress, R.D. sir?
Hello?
- Hello...
- Vikram? - Yes.
Hi. Sabrina.
How are you, Vikram?
- Who is it? - You
know I've been trying to...
Hello?
Vikram?
Are you there?
Hello?
Hello... aunty...
Sabrina here.
Jessica's sister.
What happened?
They hung up.
Sir...
Thank you.
Taxi!
Ballygunj?
Namaste.
Tea?
Vikram isn't here.
What?
I mean, Vikram isn't home right now.
You just said he is!
Yes, but he went out.
I need just five minutes.
Madam, I told you,
he isn't home right now.
Now, go away, leave!
I've come from Delhi.
I already told you.
Why don't you understand?
You're here to create trouble.
Jess, wake up.
It's Sunday, let's go to church.
I don't want to.
Let me sleep.
Or we'll have to listen
to mom's sermons all day!
Jess.
Jess?
- Please let me sleep!
Wake up, sleeping beauty!
They were here.
And you let them in?
Sabrina, I opened the door...
and they were outside.
What could I do?
"What could I do?"
Dad, their son killed Jess.
"What could I do?"
They are threatening and
bribing the witnesses...
I'm not sure if he
will ever be punished.
"What could I do?"
He will go free, dad, free!
Sorry...
Sorry, dear.
Why is life so frail...
Trying to eke out a living...
Is this really life...
Once it was like
the butterflies...
bright and carefree...
Unlike the earthworms
living underneath...
Hello... Sabrina?
We have a problem.
We have a problem.
One of the two shell
casings that was...
sent for forensics
has been replaced.
What do you mean replaced?
How is that possible?
It is possible.
Anything is possible.
Leave the room.
I took seven million rupees.
For not hitting him in the lock-up.
What are you staring at?
Everybody takes bribes.
Get it?
Only the reasons change.
Which day and age do you live in?
Who replaced the bullets?
Probably Kuldeep Singh.
Kuldeep Singh?
Lab-in-charge.
He belongs to R. D.
Rastogi's community.
Rastogi is pulling the strings.
Take my word, talk to
the DCP immediately.
Otherwise the case I've
built up, will go down the drain.
Sir, all I am saying is...
- Don't be paranoid, Sabrina.
Prosecution has handed the case
to the investigating officers.
We have to trust them,
and you have to trust us.
Sir, I'm doing that but
please try to understand.
There is some foul play.
The bullets have been changed.
Sabrina, that's not possible.
Even then if you insist...
I will look into it.
Well, I have many
more cases to attend?
Will you please?
Send Mayur in.
- Sir... - Please, Sabrina!
- Phone! Where's the phone?
Okay.
Hello?
When? Okay, I'm coming over.
- What? - I have to go.
Now? You can't do this.
Of course I can.
It's a free country.
What're you doing?
Going.
What am I supposed to do?
Fly solo.
- What!
We've just received
information that...
Indian Airlines flight number
IC-814 from Kathmandu to Delhi...
has been hijacked.
There were about 200
passengers on board.
Sources indicate that the
flight will be taken to Amritsar.
We have no information about
the hijackers and their motives.
Listen to this...
the flight is being
taken to Afghanistan.
The hijackers have demanded
the release of three terrorists.
And one of them is Jaish-E-Mohammed
chief, Maulana Masood Azhar.
I've heard the Indian
government has decided...
to release the terrorists in
exchange for the passengers.
- My sources told me.
- Mine haven't.
Let's face it.
Your sources suck. Mine don't.
Damn you! - In your dreams.
- Who are your sources?
Do you really think I'm gonna
answer that? - Okay. How reliable?
More than yours.
Sometimes you are such a bitch.
- Sometimes? All the time.
Okay, everyone. IC814
is the biggest story.
Everyone get on it. Every news
report should be related to it.
Let's be the first to get
everything out there, alright?
Meera leads the story.
Everyone backs her up. Got it?
Yes, sir.
Gaurav, there are new
developments In the Jessica case.
It seems like the
witnesses are being influenced.
Listen, cutie!
IC-814 is now priority.
But, Gaurav the Jessica case...
- Shut up!
Listen guys, IC-814 is priority.
If someone wants to pursue
another story, go ahead.
The others can come with me,
I'll need a lot of support.
So start moving your feet right now.
Trust me, Ms. Sabrina, I swear.
I swear he is staying
at a five-star hotel.
They have given him
ten million rupees.
They offered Vikram...
ten million...
or a bullet.
He made a smart choice.
They asked me what I wanted.
I'll do what is right.
Exactly what I told you,
I will testify on your behalf.
I may be poor but I'm honest.
This... it's only
because I'm in need, I swear.
Which hotel is he staying at?
Good evening. Leela.
How may I help you?
I'm concerned about a
friend of mine. Vikram Jai.
He was supposed to check in yesterday
or day before. Has he checked in?
Your name, ma'am?
- Sabrina. - Just a moment, please.
Mr. Vikram checked in day before.
Would you like to
leave a message for him?
Ma'am...
Hello?
Didn't I tell you?
- Hi...
- Hi, ma'am.
My friend Vikram Jai is staying here.
I'd like to meet him.
Sure, ma'am.
Could I have your name please?
Sabrina.
Ma'am... was it you who
called last evening?
Yes. - Ma'am, I'm afraid,
Mr. Vikram checked out last night.
Ma'am.
- Yes. - I told him you had called.
The Indian government has
freed the hostages on board...
IC-814 after six days.
In exchange for the passengers...
the government had to
release three terrorists.
Ours is a soft state.
Why does the Indian
government always give in?
Tough call, two hundred
innocent people or three terrorists.
Just a minute.
The circus is over.
I'm going home, bye.
Bye.
Give me two minutes, Sabrina.
Bye, Meera.
Hi! Meera.
Hi!
I've seen you on TV.
Hang in there. That
rogue is going down.
Sabrina. Come. We are ready for you.
See you.
- Bye.
Sabrina, the trial is
about to begin.
What do you expect from it?
Would you like to say something?
Perhaps something about Jessica.
Yes.
Jessica...
is my sister.
I mean, she was.
But she could've been
anyone's sister.
My parents adored her.
She could've been
anyone's adorable daughter.
She was a simple girl.
She had dreams like any other girl.
She wanted to own a restaurant.
She wanted to fall in love.
She wanted to marry.
And have lots of children.
But before she could
fulfill her dreams...
she was shot dead.
The circumstances in
which this happened...
I mean, just because...
at that moment...
she couldn't give someone a drink.
She was shot dead because...
someone with a pistol in his
hand and power in his head...
decided that her life was
cheaper than a glass of his drink.
Is the value of life...
so cheap in our country?
Cheaper than a drink?
We can understand that
you and your family...
I don't think you can.
I'm... I mean I'm sorry.
This could've happened...
to anyone.
I've lost my sister.
My parents lost their daughter.
Dad, I am going. See you tomorrow.
But it could've been anyone else.
Do you think the outcome of this
case will have a message for society?
I have no idea, but Aditi...
I made a promise to Jess.
And to myself.
Until justice is served...
I won't cry.
Tinki, bring me the pickle.
She deserves it.
She was a very brave girl.
Me...
and her friends...
most of whom were
with her that night...
All owe it to Jess.
And I am sure they will do it.
They are here. Get the camera ready.
What's happening here?
Some parade?
Some VIP?
Get lost!
Sir, sir... One question... Sir...
Just like that.
It is stated it very clearly.
Sir, I would like to
present the case of my client.
When you bumped into
him at the party...
you had two drinks in your hand?
Yes.
And, how drunk were you?
I don't remember, sir.
But...
you do remember that the
person you bumped into...
was him.
Yes.
- Are you sure? - Yes.
You're lying.
Objection, your honour.
- Overruled!
Your honour...
We need to point out...
a person who doesn't
remember how many drinks he had...
remembers clearly that...
he bumped into my client
amongst the 300 people there.
Did you see him with the gun?
He looks somewhat like him.
But I am not sure.
Objection, sir.
- Overruled!
Is it him?
I'm not sure.
I object, sir.
Is...
- this him?
- I object, sir.
Overruled!
- Is it him?
- Is it him?
I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
The witness is being intimidated.
The witness is being intimidated.
Sir!
He was the guy.
Who was the guy?
That man... He was the guy.
Are you sure?
What do you mean?
Are you sure he was the guy?
I am not blind.
He was the guy.
This man was the guy.
This man was the guy.
Order! Order!
- Move away.
Order in court.
It was him.
Ms. Naina...
are you sure?
It was him?
Yes.
What was he wearing?
Black trousers and a maroon shirt.
You are sure?
- I am sure.
By the way, what were you wearing?
Go on.
Answer my question.
What were you wearing?
I guess you had one drink too many.
Perhaps...
you don't remember.
I was a wearing a red Versace dress.
With a strapless
pink Eveselaron bra.
I also remember the color,
the make and the style of...
the undergarment
I was wearing under that dress.
I remember it all too clearly,
Mr. Pandit.
Would you like me to
tell you all of that?
No.
That won't be necessary.
I saw nothing, I was on the roof.
You told the police you saw him.
- I saw nothing, I was on the roof.
- That's a lie.
- I was on the roof.
- You're lying.
- I was on the roof.
- Thats a lie.
- I was on the roof.
- He is lying.
I was on the roof.
- How long will you stay there?
It's time you climbed down.
People came, someone was shot,
the police arrived...
About time you came down!
Silence please!
Sir, I wasn't here in Delhi.
My mother was ill,
I was with her in the village.
I swear, sir.
I object, sir.
Witness hostile.
- The witness has been bought.
- Overruled!
Your honour...
I'd like to call upon the most
important witness in this case.
May I?
Proceed.
- Mr. Vikram Jaisingh...
do you recognise that man?
Answer me.
I'm sorry, I don't understand Hindi.
Can you please ask
your question in English?
I'm sorry, my mistake.
Do you know this man?
I saw him at the party.
You saw him? Was he the one
who shot Jessica that night?
'Somebody shot Jessica.'
No.
Objection, sir.
Witness hostile.
- Objection overruled!
The witness is
retracting his statement.
Silence! Silence in court!
Witness may proceed.
They were two guys.
One tall and one short.
Objection, sir.
- The short guy fired at the ceiling.
And the tall guy at Jessica.
I object, sir.
And the short person resembled him?
- Objection, sir.
Somewhat.
I'm not too sure.
Objection, sir.
Go on...
- Witness hostile.
In his statement he said
that two bullets were fired...
by Manish Bhardwaj.
The statement was taken in Hindi...
and as I said I don't know Hindi.
I didn't know what was
written in the police paper.
Your honour, Vikram is lying.
We read out the
entire statement to him.
He signed only after
understanding every word.
As I said earlier
I don't understand Hindi.
Do any of these three
people resemble the person...
who shot Jessica that night?
I object, sir.
Mr. Saxena, let him finish.
Go on. Answer me.
Do any of these three resemble
the person who shot Jessica?
No.
- Objection, sir. Objection.
Overruled! Continue.
As the prime witness,
Vikram, just said...
There was a tall man
who shot at Jessica.
And a short one who
fired at the ceiling...
who somehow resembled my client.
The bullets were fired
by two people.
The bullets were fired
from two different pistols.
To prove this...
your honour...
I'd like to call upon,
forensic expert, Kuldeep Singh.
Sir...
the two used shell casings
that the police sent us...
were from different pistols.
Sir, the casings we sent to the
lab were from the same pistol.
The casings have been replaced.
Sir...
According to the prosecution...
my client is lying...
prime witnesses are lying...
a government officer is lying...
then what is the truth?
That which the evidence
doesn't show?
When will we get
the bloody judgement?
I need to go for a leak.
- Enough is enough.
Faith... there it goes again...
Crushed into bits and pieces...
Trying hard to
hide from itself...
Faith... beaten and bruised...
Alive with a false pride...
Like a storm rips through me...
Faith has brought
my heart to tears...
Faith...
has brought my
heart to tears...
Faith, falls prey to fear...
Splits my heart...
Grips me with arms open wide...
Pushes me to the
edge of destruction...
Pulls me inside out...
As a vampire sucks me dry...
Faith, the sprit is dying...
Memories strewn all around...
Bereft of any hope...
Crushed under the feet...
Of this ever changing world...
Of hollow shadows...
Set ablaze and
burnt to ashes...
Faith... mocked and scorned...
It crumbles and
rots at night...
Stripped bare of its soul...
Like footsteps on water...
Tosses and turns every night...
Faith has brought
my heart to tears...
Faith...
Faith has brought
my heart to tears...
Faith...
There it go again...
Crushed into bits and pieces...
Trying hard to
hide from itself...
Pushes me to the
edge of destruction...
Pulls me inside out...
As a vampire sucks me dry...
- Didi...
- Coffee.
What the...
The headline that
morning was a slap in the face.
It proved me wrong.
One murder.
300 high profile witnesses.
'An open and shut case. No story.'
'But I was wrong.'
'I felt betrayed.'
'I felt let down.'
'It reminded me once again
that Delhi is about power.'
Power rests in the
hands of powerful people.
The common man...
Can only grin and bear it.
This was a fact.
But I wasn't ready to live with it.
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
All accused in the Jessica murder
have been exonerated by the court.
Finally!
Its not happening.
Damn it!
The court has given four main
reasons for exonerating them.
The most important of which...
is the volte-face by
the prime witnesses.
All three witnesses had stated
That they saw Manish fire.
But in court they denied...
Having seen him.
The court also accepted forensic
expert Kuldeep Singh's report...
That the pistol she was shot with...
The murder weapon...
couldn't be produced in court.
Nor could the police prove that...
both bullets were fired from the same
gun belonging to Manish Bhardwaj.
The judge criticised the police
for major lapses in this case and...
The judge criticised the police
for major lapses in this case and...
also remarked that the
police couldn't piece together...
the sequence of events.
All of which could have
proved that Jessica was...
We'd like to remind
our viewers that...
Manish's father,
Pramod Bhardwaj is a ...
minister in the
Haryana state cabinet.
Mom, tea is ready.
Mom.
Mother Goddess, pray for us...
- Say it aloud.
Mother Goddess!
Couldn't hear you...
- Mother Goddess!
Goddess on the lioness!
- Mother Goddess, pray for us.
Mother Goddess, pray for us.
- Everyone say it aloud.
I couldn't hear you...
- Mother Goddess, pray for us.
Say it together.
- Hail Mother Goddess!
Hail Mother Goddess!
- Mother Goddess, bless us.
Say it with love!
- Hail Mother Goddess!
The Goddess on the lion!
- Hail Mother Goddess!
The Goddess residing on the hill.
- Hail Mother Goddess!
Everyone say it together.
- Hail Mother Goddess!
- Say it with love.
- Hail Mother Goddess!
Say it with love.
- Hail Mother Goddess!
Everyone say it together.
- Hail Mother Goddess!
Hail Mother Goddess!
- Hail Mother Goddess!
Dad.
Dad.
No.
Why? - Because I said so,
Meera. That's why.
Gaurav.
Gaurav. No!
No!
Have you lost it? Move. Move.
Ok, I'm not good at saying sorry,
but I am saying it.
I want to do this.
Perhaps you didn't
understand earlier...
so let me spell this out for you.
N. O.
- F. O.
You said that when
you thought this was...
an open-and-shut case, celebrity.
What's changed?
Because he got away with it, dammit.
He shouldn't have.
That scum bug should be in jail
and not at the next happening party.
He shot her, you know it, I know it.
300 witnesses know it and
half of this country knows it.
And he still got away with it.
- And no one gives a damn, Meera.
There is no story!
The court has
pronounced 'The End'! So...
Goodnight. See you.
Don't be an idiot.
I want to do this.
But why?
- Because justice has been denied.
You can live with it, I will not.
This is activism not journalism.
Okay?
We are supposed to
provide news and opinions.
Not deliver justice.
Come on, Gaurav.
We often create news...
to spruce up our profile.
We don't think about
what is right or wrong.
Let's face it. You have done it.
I have done it.
All of us have done it.
But here's a chance
to make things right.
Or at least, to make an effort.
Come on, Gaurav. We owe it
to ourselves as journalists.
And more importantly
as human beings.
Stop being so dramatic, Meera.
I'm not being dramatic.
But now I think we need dramatics.
So here it is.
Either you let me do this story...
or else, fire me.
Get your 50 kilos off my car.
- 49...
Get off.
- So you are not firing me.
There's nothing we can do now.
Actually, we can.
I have an idea.
Sometimes you...
- Act like a sweetheart.
Hello?
Aditi, it's Meera.
- Can you come over?
- Now?
No, perhaps when you
have time to spare.
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.
Hello! I was just being sarcastic.
Wake up and smell the coffee, girl.
You're not in a nine
to five government job.
This is the world of television
news and I want you here right now.
I'm sorry, Meera. I'll just leave.
Good. Grab a tissue
and wipe those tears.
I'm about to make you famous.
- What!
I remember what you said
before the IC-814 hijack.
What?
That witnesses were
influenced in the Jessica case.
I think we should pursue the story.
Let's nail that rogue.
He is a model and an actor, right?
Yes, but why?
This whole style is sensationalistic.
It's just dead wrong.
Why do you always say 'no'?
Is that your favourite word?
Meera, this is against
journalistic ethics.
Forget ethics, Gaurav.
What do our ethics say?
That we should cover our eyes.
If it's wrong, we should ignore it.
To turn a blind eye.
and sleep peacefully!
No, but they don't endorse this.
What do I want to do? Kill someone?
I only want to bring forth
the truth.
In my own way.
Who decides if your
way is right or wrong?
Do it.
- What?
For the sake of
justice and truth, go ahead.
Thank you, sir.
Hello?
- Hello...
Hi, this is Aditi from
Future Films, Mumbai.
May I speak with Vikram, please?
About what?
It's regarding
the casting of a film.
Oh, just hold on a second!
Vikram?
There's a call for you from Mumbai.
Just a minute.
- Come.
Hello! - Hi! Is that Vikram?
- Ya.
Who's calling? - Vikram,
I am calling from Future Films...
regarding our next film.
So this story is about
two guys and two girls...
set in Delhi university.
- Okay.
And these two guys have...
- I think I have seen you somewhere...
I can't remember where, but I have...
Really?
Tell him, 'don't try this on me'.
Don't try that on me.
You little flirt.
No, I'm being serious here.
Serious? Okay, anyway...
Seriously, let's talk about work?
Yes.
Oh sorry! This is Michele.
- Hi, Michele! - Hello!
She's gonna be famous.
Ok, now the film is bilingual.
What languages do you speak?
I speak English, Hindi, Bengali...
This film is in English and Hindi.
What's his Hindi like?
It's fine. Absolutely fine.
In fact I am shooting for
a Hindi film next month.
And I auditioned for it. The script
was given to me in Hindi...
and I got the part.
Tell him, you don't want his biodata.
Tell him to speak in Hindi.
Could you speak to us in
Hindi for about two minutes?
What do you want me to say?
Why don't you tell me...
Would you? I want to hear the
shape of your voice. Speak to me.
I'm wondering... what do I say...
You could say anything...
that could assure her.
I've come...
a long way to meet you.
And I hope, I can
shoot this film with you.
Shooting's already begun, handsome!
Give us some more...
- Some more?
Yes. Anything.
That dumb...
Tell him to deliver
a movie dialogue.
Give us a dialogue from a movie.
I don't remember dialogues.
But, since you're talking
about Hindi, I can tell you this.
Hindi and Bengali have...
one major difference.
Okay.
- What's with the 'okay', Aditi?
Let him show off his Hindi skills.
What?
What...
what's the major difference?
- Well...
in Bengali there is no sex.
- What?
There is no sex.
I mean, there is no gender.
In Hindi you would say,
he comes or she comes...
but in Bengali...
it's 'he comes' for both genders.
Oh, so in Hindi 'she comes'...
But, in Bengali it
would be 'it comes'.
That's interesting.
I didn't know that.
Doesn't know Hindi?!
He can give tuitions in Hindi.
What are the projects...
Aditi...
get up and slap him.
Interesting projects...
I said, slap him.
These are really nice pictures.
Those are my most recent pictures.
You are looking
really good in this.
And if you...
Just joking. Continue.
Are you okay?
- Ya. Are you?
Apple anyone? No? Sure?
Thanks. You can just go through his
pictures and see the ones you like.
Oh... I haven't told her...
and I don't think I need to, but...
would you have a visa problem?
Visa? No, why?
No, in case we decide to
shoot some portions abroad...
- I meant, due to the case.
No.
- No.
Manish had fired the bullet.
The whole world knows it.
Then why doesn't the
world do something about it?
Nobody can do a damn thing!
You mean Pramod Bhardwaj?
Look, all these guys...
the whole gang...
No one can touch them.
Weren't you there as well?
If you had to choose between
ten million rupees and a bullet.
What would you do?
Not an easy choice.
No, it's not.
I don't want ten million.
But I don't want a bullet either.
So can we talk about the film now?
What is truth?
Only what can be proved?
Or the truth itself?
This and many other questions...
have arisen In the...
Jessica murder case.
Was justice served?
What's the reason...
that one by one,
the prime witnesses...
retracted their statements?
While all the evidence
seemed to aide the accused.
Hey, speak!
As I was saying...
Hey, it still sounds like
Meera on TV.
Oh!
- Bring down the aggression.
Now that's difficult to control.
Ok, we will go again.
Hello?
It's Sabrina, Shankar.
Please accept my sympathy.
But I can't help you.
Try to understand.
Why are you so scared?
It's natural, madam.
Who is threatening you?
I can't spell out the details.
You're smart enough to understand.
- Sir...
- Yes, I'm watching it.
What happened that night?
Everybody knows what happened.
You were there, Shankar,
but I wasn't.
But so were 300 other people.
They couldn't do a thing.
And I'm just a lowly waiter.
What did you see?
I said everything in my statement.
Was the police so
incapable and helpless...
that they couldn't prove an
open-and-shut case in court?
Was money and power
used to influence justice?
It was a bidding war.
Both sides were ready to give.
And I readily accepted.
One side dangled a lot
more and I sang their tune.
What are you saying! Really?
I swear.
Can justice be auctioned?
Dad, I'm not stressed out.
Just seems like that on TV.
I'm not lying, dad.
Promila?
Dad, I can look after myself.
I can stay alone. Please. Promila.
Promila.
Dad. Dad, I'll just
call you back. Promila.
Promila.
What is it?
What's wrong, didi?
Nothing.
There's someone at the door,
I'll take a look.
Go, make some coffee.
Skank!
I heard that. Go, make some coffee.
Let's go back.
- I was ready to pay
a thousand bucks.
- But she refused to
give me a drink.
- Sir, I wanted to fire
two inches from her ear.
- You wear spectacles, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Did you wear them that night?
- No, sir.
This is explosive.
- What do you mean 'explosive'?
It's damn explosive.
You have seen the witnesses
admitting that they lied in court.
What was the truth they
were forced not to divulge?
You can now hear the truth.
Straight from the horse's mouth.
This is what Manish
Bhardwaj had to say...
when the police
questioned him about that night.
- Sir, I was furious.
- I was ready to pay
a thousand bucks.
- But she refused to give me
a drink.
- Sir, I wanted to fire
two inches from her ear.
- You wear spectacles, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Did you wear them that night?
- No, sir.
- Two inches from her ear?
- Sir, then an old woman came in.
She screamed...
Why did you shoot her?
Sir... then I fled from there.
- I took a ride on a scooter.
- Sir, there was
a field behind the motel.
- Sir, I was terrified.
Are we supposed to
ignore this bitter truth?
Sabrina...
- Dear...
can you increase the volume...
a little bit.
Let it go, dad. Forget it.
It's over.
No, it's not over.
This case has raised questions for...
the police, the government,
the legal system.
And we demand answers.
We believe that justice wasn't
delivered in the Jessica case.
Justice was denied.
We think that money and power were
instrumental in burying the truth...
and tampering with the evidence.
We think the police failed
miserably in doing their duty.
And in producing the
evidence in court.
We strongly believe this
case deserves to be reopened.
Justice should prevail.
'Justice for Jessica' is our
initiative to demand justice.
For Jessica, her family
and all of us.
If you think justice was denied...
type 'Justice for Jessica' on
your phone and text it to 6-6-8-8.
Yes. Thanks.
Meera.
- Speak.
We have received a thousand texts
and calls in 20 minutes. - What?
Yeah, the phone lines are jammed.
We are getting so many calls.
You have to go live in 90 seconds.
What! 90 seconds?
Come on, then...
What are you doing here?
Meera, your skirt...
- I don't need it.
Ya.
We're getting calls from all over...
Calcutta, Hyderabad, Gwalior...
Come on, guys. Move. Move. Move.
Meera, you have to take a few.
- Going in 15...
10. 9. 8. 7.
6. 5. 4. 3. 2.
Ok, guys, go.
- 1. Go.
I think justice was denied.
Police, government, law and
order are mere words in our country.
I have a daughter too.
If they can go scot free,
anyone else can.
Money and power can't
buy everything.
No. I want justice for Justice.
Mumbai too is furious with the
verdict. What do you have to say?
Whether it's Delhi or Mumbai,
people will be furious.
He has confessed to his crime.
Then why isn't he punished?
This is a matter of law and order.
The common man will either
go to the police or the court.
And if they are not just,
where do we go?
It's true.
It's quite scary and
even more so for women.
I feel I have been denied justice.
I feel very angry.
We want justice. We want justice.
We want justice. We want justice.
Justice for Jessica!
Justice for Jessica!
Justice for Jessica!
We have with us retired Chief
Justice of India, C. N. More.
Sir...
the public is angry...
with the police, the government...
with the legal system.
Well, you see, our legal system...
- was created by
the British in 1860.
- And we are
following it to this day.
This circus is still going on?
In those times criminals used
to commit a crime and flee on...
a bullock-cart or a horse-cart.
- I don't believe this.
- Things are different today.
- We have progressed.
What's with you?
- Unless we overhaul
our legal system...
these things will continue.
And those who can misuse it...
will continue doing so.
Yes, sir.
Yes, just a minute.
Yes, I'm giving it to him.
Sir, it's the Chief Minister.
Yes, sir?
Public anger is at boiling point.
We can't afford to take this risk.
The high command is
of the same opinion.
Moreover, it's affecting
the image of the party.
Sir...
trust me.
It's just a gentle breeze...
and it will pass.
It seems more like a storm...
that will destroy all of us.
Sir, at least you should trust...
Do whatever it takes,
but save my Monu.
All of us know who is responsible.
Everyone knows this.
The government may be mute,
but we aren't!
We have to do something,
we can't remain inside our homes.
They got away
with Jessica's murder.
Someday they'll get away
with raping one of us.
Just because they have power
and money they can do anything?
No. We want justice for Jessica.
I want justice for Jessica.
We all want justice for Jessica.
- Justice for Jessica!
Justice for Jessica.
Justice for Jessica.
Meera, the 'Middle-Finger-Protest'
from Chandigarh is online.
Middle finger? Pass them through.
Terrific name!
My friend and I, thought
it would blow everyone away.
It's unbelievable!
We are 15 in all and
in one voice we say:
Justice for...
Justice for...
No, no! Justice for...
Justice for...
No! Justice for?
Justice for...
I'll say it myself,
Justice for Jessica.
The legal system and
police are helpless.
Why weren't the witnesses protected?
Every democracy
needs witness protection.
To safeguard justice and victims.
Or witnesses will
continue to be threatened.
- 6-6...
- 8-8...
Did it go through?
- Yes, it did.
- Thank you.
Just don't tell Sabrina,
she might get angry.
I won't tell her.
Justice for Jessica!
Justice for Jessica!
Jessica. Jessica.
Justice for Jessica!
Jessica. Jessica.
Justice for Jessica!
Mr. Shyam Tolani,
can you see the public's ire?
The truth was disguised as
a lie and presented in court.
And the guilty were set free.
Who is guilty...
who is innocent?
What gives you, the media,
the right to decide this?
The correct decision
is given by the court.
And the court has done that.
The decision itself was wrong,
Mr. Shyam Tolani.
Why?
Just because you think so?
The evidence... the witnesses...
mean nothing to you?
You have tarnished the judicial
system of this great country.
But sir...
people go to the court for justice.
And who decides whether or not,
justice was delivered?
You?
The media?
Hello!
Ma'am. You can't park here. Ma'am.
Where do I park? Do it yourself.
- Ma'am.
What?
The High Court will issue
this press release tomorrow.
They are issuing a 'suo
moto' notice to the police.
Seeking an explanation for
why the accused were set free.
You're sure?
- You want to bet on it?
Wow, this is a major development.
Sir...
Listen...
listen...
We will reply to the
High Court notice.
Sir...
- But sir...
Please!
We are appealing in
the High Court against ...
the decision of the lower court.
- Ma'am...
- Sir...
Sir, I have a question.
What if the High Court
dismisses the appeal?
I hope this
investigation does not bury us.
Don't worry.
Public memory is very short.
And we will take care of the rest.
- A martyr's grave is always fresh.
- We also know how to
turn martyrs into villains.
- Call Sabrina,
we need her reaction. - Okay.
What is it?
I received this text
a few minutes ago.
Candlelight march for Jessica,
India Gate...
5th February, 5 o'clock.
Day after tomorrow at five p.m.
I will be there. Will you?
We were so high, man...
and we got him to spend everything.
- Think about it.
- Why do you idiots drink so much?
That's a new text.
New text message.
What's this?
Candlelight for Jessica,
India Gate, five p.m.
I got it too.
Isn't she the girl who
got shot at a party?
- It's sad. - Should we go?
She is very upset,
doesn't want to speak to anyone.
Try again, I'll talk to her.
The entire country
is fighting for you...
and now you don't want to fight?
No.
Why not?
Because I already know what you
showed and what the public saw on TV.
I screamed myself hoarse
but nothing came of it.
The police and the
legal system did not help.
Nor can you do anything now!
I don't want to go through
this all over again, I'm fed up.
My sister was murdered and
then my mom passed away.
Dad is in hospital.
I haven't had a life with the police,
evidence, court cases.
The last time I checked I was 22.
Just 22.
I don't have a life.
I don't have a boyfriend.
A normal life which every
normal girl experiences.
I have to beg for it.
I want to live but I can't.
I am tired of running around
the police and the courts.
I can't do this anymore.
There is no hope. There never was.
I just want to move on.
I am fed up.
You are fed up?
You don't want to fight anymore...
because you're fed up?
Are you watching a movie...
that you're fed up and
you want to walk away?
Since when is this
your personal battle?
You don't understand...
- Yes, I don't understand.
I don't understand how you can
let your sister's killers get away.
I don't understand how
you can give up...
when the entire nation
is fighting for her.
She was your sister.
Not mine and not of
the hundred and...
thousands who are
fighting out there.
And you are fed up? Rubbish!
Don't look away, Sabrina. Look
at me and you better listen to me.
All the work that you
have done will mean nothing.
This is not the time to give up.
This is the time to
get back to rogues...
Do you even know what the public
is doing for your sister?
We have received more than
two hundred thousand messages.
And everyday we get thousands more.
These messages will be taken
to the President of India.
The pressure is rising.
On the police and the judiciary.
On the entire establishment.
And you want to walk away from
this just because you're fed up?
You're 28.
You don't have a boyfriend.
And you don't have a normal life.
This is not about you or
how you feel, sweetheart.
This is about Jessica.
And you better understand that.
The candlelight is
tomorrow at five p.m.
You have to be there.
And I am not leaving
till you say a yes.
And he said... Amitabh
Bachchan's shameless imitator.
Those dialogues were hilarious.
- Are you kidding me?
- I just couldn't control... Hey!
Bloody scoundrel.
Stop, you idiot.
You're smiling? Bloody scoundrel!
Go faster...
Go faster!
How dare you touch her!
How dare you touch her!
- Jess, let him go.
- How dare you touch her, rascal.
Let him go.
Let him go?
Go and touch your mother!
- I lost balance on the cycle.
- Jess...
- I will teach you a lesson.
- That's enough.
- Cycle lost balance?
- Jess, leave him.
- You think you can get away?
Why are you fighting with him?
- I am sorry.
- Go apologize to your mother!
- Jess?
You scoundrel,
how dare you touch her?!
- Are you mad?
- Jess, enough. - You scoundrel.
- She is mad.
- Bloody hell!
- Running away now?
- Let him go!
- Try and touch me.
- Jess, let him go.
Have you lost it?
You want to let him go?
Jess, forget it, let him go.
Forget it?
Idiot, stop being a nerd.
This is Delhi, you
have to learn to fight.
Today it was just a touch,
someday it could be rape.
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Idiot!
Forget it!
In pain...
the heart cries out...
a prayer...
Prayer...
that is balm to my pain...
You should've recognised that
b******. - And it's prayer...
It could've been me
instead of Jessica.
I did, didn't I?
I told them what I saw.
Didn't I, Peter?
I confessed to what I saw.
If the court doesn't believe...
how is it my fault?
You lied, mom.
- Why? Why is everybody blaming me?
Why is everybody blaming me, Peter?
Why are they blaming me?
Despair pleads at
the Lord's door...
Why doesn't joy reign...
What's your comments being
Delhi's CM?
From what I've heard and seen,
I feel justice was denied.
As a woman, it saddens me
even more.
Bow your head...
Say a prayer...
Speak up..."
Without saying a word...
Without moving your lips...
Call out... call out...
Mr. President, we have received
more than 200,000 SMSes...
and lots of emails in this case.
Listen to your heart... Speak up...
Thank you. I will have a look at it.
Thank you, sir.
Has your party
pressured you into resigning?
Absolutely not.
There's no pressure at all.
Namaste.
Mr. President, what do you have
to say about the Jessica case?
You see, I have got
more than 200,000 SMSes...
and I am going
through each one of them.
Let me assure you, if something's
needed from my end...
I will not hesitate in doing that.
We have to give it
a lot of thought...
if we need to overhaul
our judicial system.
So that those who seek justice,
aren't denied of it.
Say what you will...
but there are some
serious questions.
The fact is nobody has the right
to make a mockery of the judiciary.
What's your opinion, Rekhaji?
"What you call prayers..."
"it's not just to
heal the wounds."
"it's not just to
heal the wounds."
"It's also strength,
it's also revolution..."
"it's also a
path to get justice."
The person...
"It's also a path
to get justice."
for whom you are here...
I am here for her as well.
Thank you.
"Let's pray together."
Despair pleads at
the Lord's door...
Why doesn't joy reign...
These days of pain
seem infinite...
That evening I saw India come
together for the third time.
It felt as if
they had suffered injustice.
And Jessica was talking
through them.
Sabrina wasn't alone and helpless...
the entire nation was with her.
It was fighting for her.
The public raised its voice.
They were asking the same question.
And someone had to give an answer.
"Speak up."
In pain...
the heart cries out...
a prayer...
You won, Sabrina.
The High Court has
issued a press release.
The High Court accepted the appeal...
by the police against
the lower court judgement.
The case is being fast-tracked.
This case raised serious questions.
The High Court...
would like a rehearing of this case.
The High Court has issued...
non-bailable warrants
against the accused.
And the hearing of this case...
You see...
the High Court will
fast-track this case.
And will hold its
hearings on a daily basis.
So that in this case...
justice is delivered.
And soon.
You won.
Meera, thank you.
As I told you I never
understood Delhi. I never will.
And just when I had
begun to accept that...
Delhi belongs to the powerful...
that's when the
power left their hands...
and went to its rightful place.
To the hands of the people.
The Supreme Court held
Manish Bhardwaj guilty...
for the murder of Jessica.
He was sentenced to
life imprisonment.
Vishal Rastogi and Lucky Singh
were sentenced for four years each.
Last year, Sanjit passed away.
Sabrina still
manages her travel agency.
She still doesn't have a boyfriend.
And I am still a witch.
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Delhi's left me..."
"Delhi's left me..."
"Delhi's left me stunned."
"Delhi's left me..."
"Delhi's left me stunned."
"Delhi's left me..."
"Delhi's left me stunned."
"Delhi's left me stunned."
"Damn Delhi..."
"This powerful city...
This ruthless city..."
"It left me stunned."
"It has left me..."
"It has left me
completely shocked."
"What shall I do? O Lord!"
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Delhi... Delhi... Delhi..."
"Damn Delhi..."
"Damn Delhi..."
"This powerful city...
This ruthless city..."
"It left me stunned."
"Delhi's left me..."
"Delhi's left me stunned."
"Delhi's left me..."
"Delhi's left me stunned."
"She's here. She's a witch.
She's got a heart of gold,
but she swears a lot."
"Move aside. Move aside."
"She is full of passion.
Move aside."
"This is hot blood.
Move aside."
"She is a bit naughty.
She is a bit mischievous."
"She is a bit intoxicating.
She's a bit poisonous."
"She's a firecracker.
She's a bomb waiting to explode."
"She's super spicy.
She's feisty."
"She gutsy."
