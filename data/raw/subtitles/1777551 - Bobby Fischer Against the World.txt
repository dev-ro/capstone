But he wanted to show Spassky that he was ready to face him
So he decided to fight
But it was a mistake.
It was a disaster.
The criticisms against him were already being prepared.
When one player seizes the other
Psychologically, his mind is left in a vacuum.
If he loses his direction, someone will take his place.
We received many letters.
Specifically they advised him to be more careful.
It was believed that there was something in the seats.

He always ate oatmeal, always with
boiled eggs for breakfast, and did so for years.
He was the same with chess.
