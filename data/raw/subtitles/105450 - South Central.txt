Hey, what's up?
Deuce!
Yeah!

Hey, yo, ossifer,
Come here.
Yeah. Come here.
Look, i just wanted
to say i'm sorry--
That's my boy--
always get the last word
On a suck ass hack.
Welcome back to the street, man.
Let's swing back and spray that
poot-butt again.
I see Loco ain't changed none.
He's still loked out on PCP.
Yo, Bear, give me eight ball, babe.
Man, things changed
since you been locked down, Bob.
Deuce is springing
up and down Hoover street.
I'm organizing The Deuce gangs.
I'm fixing to throw
a meeting for all the new sets.
I was waiting on you.
Bobby, you want a hit of this tranq?
It's a fucking roller coaster.
Aw, man, get that shit off me.
I heard Carole pinched a baby boy.
What's up, man?
Is it yours?
Yeah, it's mine.
So, what she call it?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Hey, man, i don't fucking know, O.K.?
O.K., man. Calm down.
I'm locked down, man.
she don't come around,
So i don't know nothing.
A kid going to cramp
your style, Bobby?
No, man, he's just
another little Deuce.
[Loco]
That nigger mama
is so old,
She still ironing
her clothes with a hot rock.
Fuck you, man.
Your mama was so old,
I bet she was the waitress
at the last supper.
Hey, hey, Ray.
Yo, Bobby.
Yo, man.
What up?
Carole out here.
What?
Hey, Carole!
Bobby!
Baby!
Bobby!
Baby. Why didn't you tell me?
I could have done my hair
or something.
What's up, Ray Ray, Loco,
Bear?
Why didn't you tell me Bobby
was getting out?
Shit. Everybody knew, Carole.
You stink. You high on
that PCP shit?
That's cold, Bobby.
Why you dogging me?
Genie, This is Bobby.
I told you about Bobby.
Bobby, this is Genie Lamp.
Glad to meet you, Bobby.
Glad in your motherfucking
ass, cuz.
Smack man.
Long time, Ray Ray.
Yeah. Since they ran your ass
off of Grape street.
I don't run, Ray.
I move.
You move...
But your dope stays in my hood.
You are too possessive, Ray.
Plenty of drug addicts
to go around.
We don't like your shit
in our hood, man.
"we," my ass. You.
You don't like it, Ray, because no money
comes to you.
You don't give a shit
about no hood.
Now is not the time, Ray.
Bobby, let's go home.
It's your first day out.
Ray, no trouble.
This ain't over, Lamp.
This is my hood.
We'll take it up at another time, Ray.
Count on it, smack man.
Kill you, fool!
He's a Kansas City pimp.
Now, it's old hustlers like that...
They got to go so Deuce
can take over.
We got to weed out
the independents, man,
make our
neighborhoods safe
for our kids
and our bitches.
Go in the house.
I'll be in there in a minute.
Yo, Bobby, man,
Watch your bitch...
'cause that smooth-talking snake
is probably fixing to turn her out.
Now, at the meeting we'll figure out
how we going to deal with the rest
of this shit.
Cool?
Cool.
All right, man.
Tomorrow.
His name is Jimmie.
Why was you in that fool's apartment?
I didn't have no money, Bobby.
You had enough to buy PCP.
If it hadn't have been for Genie Lamp,
I wouldn't have had money for cigarettes.
What did you give him
In return?
I didn't give him
Nothin'.
He was just nice
To me.
Nice! He's a hustler.
Don't play me
For no sucker!
I ain't playing you,
Bobby.
Why no letters,
No visits?
I didn't even know
His fucking name!
I was alone, Bobby.
I didn't have no money,
No car, no nothing.
I had to go on
The county.
I cursed you.
I hated you
For leaving me.
And you know what else?
I had the baby
By myself, Bobby--
By myself.
And it hurt me.
It hurt me.
[door closes]
Shit.
I'm your daddy.
Goo goo?
Daddy?
What's up?
You're going to
Get me in trouble.
Hey, baby.
How you doing?
Hey.
All right?
Everything
Going to be all right.
I'm home now.
You did a good job.
He's a fine boy.
I missed you, Bobby.
I love you.
Hey, what up?
All right.
What up?
All right.
Shut the fuck up.
We...
Are Deuce...
And we multiplying.
Schools are turning out
More Deuces
Than graduates.
The gangs is fixing
To be the strongest force
On the streets of L.A.
So we...
Got to be
The strongest gang.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
Deuce, Deuce, Deuce.
If they put us in jail...
Fuck 'em.
We take over the jails
And the streets, too.
Now, you all know
Bad ass Bobby Johnson.
Well, his daddy and my daddy
Are in prison today.
Why?
Because in the 1965
Watts riots,
They tried to control
The day.
You don't control the day.
The man controls the day.
But we will...
Control the night.
Now, at night
We take over the land,
And that's the same thing
As owning it,
And don't shit go down
In the hood
Unless we say so.
Every Deuce set
Should lay claim
To a school or a park
In their hood
And respect
Each others' rights.
And to make sure
There ain't no misunderstanding
About whose shit
Is whose,
Every gangster in the set
Should write his name
Somewhere obvious
In the park or playground.
Now, to finance us...
We got this.
My boy.
Homeboy.
You buy it from me,
The money stays
In the hood.
Sell it.
Don't use it.
Let the other fools
Have the habit.
And don't let nobody
Sell nothing in your hood.
Now, i know there are
A lot of drug dealers
On this side of town,
But that shit's
Going to stop.
Now, we going to
Have to kill somebody
To send out the message,
"don't fuck with Deuce."
Now, in 1972
Deuce started out
With two members.
Now there are hundreds.
In five years...
There'll be thousands.
Control your hood.

Real cocksman
With the ladies.
I never heard of him!
Ooh.
O.K., Bobby.
O.K.
You like potatoes,
Bobby?
This looks like
It could have been
An idaho red.
It's a little bit
Mangled, though.
There's a hole
Right through it.
I got your
Fingerprints all over
That gun, Bobby.
You want to talk
To me now?
My boy still here?
I think so.
Can i see him?
Sure.
Why not?
Yeah, it's me.
Bring his kid down.
These two guys we
Picked up with you.
Were they
In on this hit?
You're going up
For this.
This isn't
The youth authority.
You think it's right
You take the rap?
You'll do 10 years
While they do
Three or four months
For possession.
[knock on door]
Oh.
This is a cute baby,
Bobby.
Too bad
It's going to be
A long, long time
Before he sees
His daddy again.
You're going
To miss him
Saying
His first words.
You'll miss
His first days
Of school.
You'll miss it all.
And why?
Give me some names.

To the station.

I'm sorry.
Is he O.K.?
No, he isn't O.K.
Can he talk?
He's very weak.
He sleeps
Most of the time.
You can sit
With him.
I'll leave you
Alone.
Maybe i'll just wait
Till he can talk.
You don't want
To sit with him?
No point in just
Staring at him, huh?
You suit yourself.
He got his self caught
Robbing off
Somebody's goods.
He'll end up in the pen
Just like his daddy...
And his granddaddy.
Hey!
Hay is for
A jackass, darky.
There it is.
Ping-pong.
Shit.
You never played
Ping-pong?
Ain't you got a pool table?
No, but this is fun.
Want to try it?
That's honky ball.
I ain't playing
Honky ball.
Honky ball?
Kim, do you two mind
If we try?
No, nurse Shelly.
He can play.
Don't put yourself out.
I ain't interested
In no honky ball anyhow.
Nonsense.
You're going
To love it.
Pick up your paddle.
1 for me,
Nothing for you.
You're going to be
Real easy to beat.
2 for me
And nothing for you.
Really easy to beat.
Good.
Ray!
Hey, bubba!
This ain't my house.
Come on. In.
What about my stuff?
We'll take care of it.
Just got out of the
Hole, didn't you,
Jitterbug?
Now, what you want?
World's been
Showing you its booty
A long time, right?
What? I got
A glass forehead, man?
Yeah, man.
Well put.
These eyes see right
Through to your brain.
And with your mind,
You can't do
But one of three things.
You can kill your enemy
And wind up
On death row,
You can turn on yourself
And go crazy,
Or you can change.
My name's Ali.
Oh!
Jimmie, are you all right?
Yeah. My back hurts
When i slam.
Well, don't slam.
No way!
You getting
To like honky ball
Just a little, huh?
Your boy?
Yeah.
How old?
He's 3 in that picture,
But he's 10.
Birthday's july 13, 1981.
[buzz]
Line 'em up!
Close 'em.
What the fuck is this?
You're here
Because you are
Now my property.
You belong
To the aryans,
You little sugar.
We own you.
Suck my dick!
I don't tolerate
No disrespect
From my property.
Fuck you, Buddha.
That's better.
Now let's get down
To business.
Making a big mistake
Butting in
On aryan business,
Ali.
I do not mean
To pry, Buddha,
I truly do not.
I just want to ensure
This man
Gets a fair turn.
He is
Aryan property now.
He belongs to me.
The Deuce
Paid their debt
With him.
Are you
Going to stand
In the middle
Of that?
No, Buddha.
I break no jailhouse laws.
It's not my intent
To break the peace.
But somebody got to ensure
You don't break any laws.
What the fuck
You talking about?
We all know
Bobby here a man.
He a man,
So nobody punking
Nobody here.
Am i right, Buddha?
Buddha, do you,
Or do you not
Recognize
This a man
Standing here?
Yeah.
Yeah, i know
He's a man.
Good.
Now all that remains
Is the terms.
What is it you require
Of an indentured servant?
A what?
Um, a helper.
Oh...
Well, cigarettes,
Lots of cigarettes.
Give me
A specific number,
Buddha.
How many cigarettes?
15 box,
Plus interest.
You don't have to--
Quiet!
What interest?
Yeah, laundry,
Shoeshines, errands.
I want his dessert
For 15 years.
Let's be reasonable.
Let's say three months.
All of the above
For three months.
O.K.
Let's eat breakfast.
Jimmie.
Oh, i'm sorry
To interrupt your game.
I'm out of here.
I'll see you,
Jimmie.
Jimmie,
This is dr. King.
He'd like to talk
With you, O.K.?
Why don't we
Have a seat over here
By the window?
All right?
O.K.
Do you know
What child abuse means?
Sure. That's parents
Riding down on their kids.
Does your mama
Ride down on you?
She used to.
She's a sherm head now.
A what?
PCP.
Yeah, she smokes it
In her cigarettes.
You know.
Does she fix meals
For you at home?
Nope.
Not ever?
I take care of myself.
What about school?
Does your mama send you
To school every day?
School's for squares.
A fool can't make
No money at school.
So how many
Parole hearings
You been denied on?
Six.
Whew.
This brother, Ray Ray,
You trying to kill him?
Yeah...Maybe.
'cause you think
He shot your boy.
No, because
He's responsible,
Because
He had Jimmie out
Stealing for him,
Because he used me,
And he used my son.
So where were you...
The boy's daddy,
While Ray Ray
Was abusing him?
I was in here.
Mmm-hmm.
In prison.
What you saying?
You saying
It was my fault
He got shot?
You saying
I should have
Been there?
I ain't saying
A damn thing.
You doing
All the saying.
Why do you even
Give a shit?
What is it to you?
I'll tell you.
I had a boy.
Now you going to
Preach to me, right?
Yeah,
I'm going to preach...
And you
Going to listen!
I had a boy...
And i was on him.
I was on him
About how he dressed
For school,
And i was on him
About leaving his toys
Cluttered around the house.
He'd say, "hi, daddy,"
And wave his hand.
I'd say,
"hold your shoulders back."
Later on in school,
I kept him
From his friends
'cause his grades
Were too low.
I embarrassed him
By marching him home
In front of me.
I loved my job
And my women
More than my own son!
Behaved like that
His whole young life.
He ran away
When he was 13...
Hooked up
With a tough bunch
Of hardheads
And got killed
Not much later.
Shot down dead.
So i took their lives,
Three of them,
And i ended up
In here...
For life, man.
I was some daddy.
See...
That's a problem
In our community, man.
Black man
Is in prison
Or dodging prison,
And his kids suffer.
It's the anger
In the black man,
The cycle of hate.
You in that cycle,
Little brother.
Did you grow up
With your daddy?
No.
I see inside you, man.
You still got some time
Before it eats you up,
But you've got to break
Your cycle.
Hate is broken by giving.
I give to you,
And i break
My own hate cycle.
Why do i give a shit?
Me...And you...
We brothers,
And we got to be there
For our children.
For me, it's too late,
But not for you.
You owe me 15 box
Of cigarettes.
You repay me by reading.
Two hours every day.
I owe everybody
In this joint,
And all i did
Was help my homeboy
Loco.
Helping is costly.
Hello.
I'm nurse Shelly.
I'm sorry i'm late.
I've been taking care
Of Jimmie.
Excuse me.
All healed up.
The pain gone?
You know,
We're going to
Miss you, Jimmie.
You've been like
One of the family
Around here.
I'm real proud of you.
Jimmie...
These people are here
To help you.
I know
You don't think so
Right now,
But you need help, baby.
They're going to help you
Have a better life
So you can grow up
To be a good man.
You understand
What i'm saying?
Do you trust me?
Then trust them, too.
O.K.?
Come on.
I'm going to miss you
Most of all, nurse Shelly.
I'm going to
Miss you, too, baby.
I got pretty good
At honky ball,
Didn't i?
You sure did, honey.
I'm real proud of you.
Bye, nurse Shelly.
Goodbye, Jimmie.
All right, guys,
Listen up.
This is Jimmie.
He's our new boy.
This bunk
Will be yours,
All right?
Breakfast around here
Is at 7:00.
Lunch is at noon.
Dinner is at 6:30.
If you're late,
You miss it.
Lights out
At 9 P.M. Sharp.
Get yourself situated,
And we'll talk later.
Off that bunk,
Rodriguez,
Or your ass
Is in a sling.
* i had a knife *

I feel like my brain's
Swelling, Ali.
Look at all this stuff
I never knew about,
All these people
I never heard of--
Adam Powell, Garvey,
Elijah, W.E.B. Dubois.
Man!
Lights
Are coming on
Inside you.
Man, that's
A glorious feeling
When that happens.
Listen to this.
"you may tie my hands
With chains
"and my feet
With shackles
"and put me
In a dark prison,
"but you shall not
Enslave my thinking,
"for it is free,
"like a breeze...
In the spacious sky."
Mmm.
That's a little beautiful poetry
about attitude.
Bobby.
You remember i asked you about
your parole denials?
Yeah.
You know why you keep getting turned down?
No.
Attitude.
And lie with your mouth,
Say you're going to be good,
You're going to go straight forever,
But your attitude is saying the truth--
"i'm going to kill you.
I'm going to rape your daughter."
Ain't nobody
Going to let you
Out of this cage,
And ain't nobody going to let you
into their confidence
Until you change your attitude.
Truly change your thinking.
Like this says, "my thinking is mine.
I choose."
That's it.
Buddha said shine those.
Tell Buddha it's done.
A salaam aleichem.
Aleichem salaam.
How's it going?
We're about there.
He wanted ferrari red,
But i talked him into soul-brother brown.
Ow!
This will be the final touch
of the new you,
Jitterbug.
Aah!
Come on, let's get your mind
off the pain.
Author.
"one day on the red hills of Georgia,
"the sons of former slaves
"and the sons
Of former slave owners
Will sit together at
The table of brotherhood."
Martin Luther King, Jr.

Without staying down with him."

Good.

Death to change its name
"from southern rope
To northern dope.
"too many black youths
have been victimized
"by pushing dope into their veins
Instead of hope into their brains."
Finish.
Jesse Jackson.
You sure don't look
Much like a killer no more
With that badge of shame off your face.
Ali...
Thank you...
For helping me.
You repay me...
By helping another.
Bless yourself
By helping someone else.
Faith...
Hard work...
Help.
You got it?
I got it.
You got parole?
I got parole.
Congratulations.
Thank you
Very much.
You got
Your second chance.
Don't blow it, brother.
I won't blow it.
Are you a Deuce?
No, i am not.
Can you stand alone
Like a man has to?
Yes.
Go find your boy.
Save his life.
I'll do it.
If it takes my life,
I'll do it.
I believe you, Bobby.
Hey.
Carole.
Hey...
Bobby?
Why didn't you
Tell me you was
Getting out, Bobby?
I would have
Done my hair up,
Or something.
Shit.
[moaning]
I don't
Feel good, Bobby.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Come on, get up.
Oh, Bobby.
Baby...
Where's Jimmie?
Aw, Carole.
Carole.
Come here.
Here. Drink this.
Drink this.
All of it.
Bobby. Baby,
I didn't know
You was getting out.
Carole. Carole!
What is this?
I'll pay.
Don't worry.
Carole!
This says they took
Jimmie away. Why?
They--they took him.
He gone.
He just gone.
Gone where?
He gone bye-bye.
Carole--
Look, don't let--
Don't let
This be happening.
How are you doing?
As it says--
James was brought here
Back in august
As a ward of the court.
I'd like to see him.
No. No, no.
No, that would be
Impossible.
Why impossible?
Well, for one,
Visitors must have
A visitor's pass
Issued by the county.
Two--visiting day
Is thursday.
This is friday.
Three--
Even to visit on thursday,
You have to be put on
The boy's visiting list.
I'm going to level
With you.
I just got out
Of prison.
I haven't seen my son
In 10 years.
Prison? Oh, shit.
We have to get permission
From the state
And the parole officer
And the county
To even put an ex-convict
On the visiting list.
Sorry, buddy.
I need to see my son,
But will you help me?
I'm sorry.
I understand.
It's not your call.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to let you
Visit your son.
Thanks.
Keep it short.
In the future,
All visits will be
By the rules.
Agreed?
Yeah.
This way.
Keep it short.
Hi.
So, what up?
It's me, Jimmie.
Bobby Johnson.
It's your daddy.
They treating
You right in here?
They feeding you O.K.?
Yeah.
You're really my dad?
Yeah.
You going to
Take me out of here?
Yeah, i'm going
To get you out of here,
But that's going
To take some time.
How much time
You talking about?
I don't know how long...
Exactly.
Yeah, right.
But i am going
To get you out of here.
You have to believe me.
I'm not going
To leave you in here.
When i get out,
We can ride down
On that buster
Willie Manchester.
Who?
Willie Manchester,
The fool that gauged me.
Look, man.
I'm sorry, man.
I should've been here for you.
I should've been here.
We could do it tonight.
Go find that nigger
And spray his butt.
No, we can't do that.
What you mean, we can't?
I mean, it's not about killing.
Where your black heart at?
I took it off.
Why?
What you do that for?
Listen, Jimmie,
I've put all that
Gangbanging stuff
Behind me,
And you should
Do the same.
No way, man.
You crazy.
Jimmie,
Listen to me.
You ain't my daddy.
You ain't
Bobby Johnson.
Who are you?
I am your daddy.
Man, i'm outty.

Why?
Who are you?
Bobby Johnson.
I'm his daddy.
Whoa, whoa,
Whoa, whoa.

Jimmie's at the detention center, right?
Not anymore.
Your son ran away last night.

What happened?
Well, we're trying to find out.
You're sure that he didn't come here?
Of course.
O.K.
If he gets
In touch with you,
You contact us
Immediately.
You got that?
Yeah.
Hey, man, what the hell

Of other bad shit.

Where Jimmie is?
Look, i ain't
Playing games either.
Now, the Deuce
Is 50,000 strong
All across L.A. Now,
Bobby.
I built
The organization
That we were
Talking about.
You helped start it.
So--so what
You telling me now, man?
You don't want
No part of it?
I owe you, man.

I'm just looking
For my boy.
Now, for the last time,
Do you know
Where he at?
He right here, cuz.
Jimmie.
I ain't
Going back there.
Listen, son,
You're doing this wrong.
I ain't
Going back there.
No way!
Jimmie, listen,
If you don't
Go back there now,
You'll be
Running from the law
Your whole life.
I won't let you
Make the same mistakes
I made.
I'll get you out...
Legally.
That's bullshit!
I know it'll
Take some time,
But i can do it.
I want you
Back with me.
He don't want to go.
That's no place
For a Deuce.
Stay out of this, Ray.
This is between
Me and my son.
This is not
Your business!
Wrong.
It is my business.
Now, the county's
His mama now,
And Deuce
Is his daddy.
And i am Deuce.
Deuce ain't his daddy.
I'm his daddy!
Deucing got me
10 years in prison,
Jimmie,
And it got you shot.
It's wrong.
You can see that.
Now, fuck that!
Let him decide
For himself.
Now, J...
You going to stay with us,
Make some money,
Drive a BMW, have fun,
Or you want to go back to kiddie jail?
I ain't
Going back there.
It isn't jail,
Jimmie.
Don't let him
Lie to you.
Ray Ray
Is a drug dealer.
He hurts people.
I don't want
To see you die
In these streets.
J-Rock,
How's your back feel?
You want to take care
Of that business?
You want to
Smoke old Willie
Since your
Punk-ass daddy here
Ain't got the heart
To put in the work?
I spent
10 years of my life
In prison
For putting in work.
I'm your daddy,
Jimmie.
I love you.
I want you
Back with me.
Deuce take care
Of their own.
Like you
Took care of Loco.
Fuck that sherm head.
Let's put in the work.
Stay here, J.
We going to
Put in some work.
Get your punk ass
Out of here.
Uhh!
Say...
Say, brothers,
What's going on here?
You fucking
With the Deuce.
No, no, no,
Damn it.
You got
The wrong man.
I don't know
No aces, Deuces,
Or anybody.
Sure, you do.
Come here, J.
This is J-Rock.
You recognize J-Rock,
Don't you?
I ain't never
Seen him before
In my life.
Look real good,
Willie.
Show him, J.
Th-that was
An accident.
I was protecting
My family.
Stop bitching!
Now, you shot him
In the back,
Motherfucker.
I swear.
I didn't mean
To hurt him.
Take him out, J.
He's all yours.
Jimmie!
Stay out of this,
Bobby.
Jimmie,
Put the gun down.
Shut the fuck up!
Jimmie,
Look at me.
Look at me!
Think a minute!
Bear!
Uhh!
Don't try
To interfere.
You an outsider
Now, Bobby,
And i will
Shoot you down.
All right, J.
Now, this motherfucker
Shot you in the back.
Show him what's up.
No...
Young man,
Please.
All right, J.
This'll get you
Your black heart.
As god as my witness,
I didn't mean it!
This is for
Your homeboys.
Jimmie, don't.
Just steady,
Aim,
And pull on it.
Nothing to it.
No!
Let him go now!
Do what you going to do.
I'm going to blow your fucking head off!
Go ahead then.
Let him go!
Can't do that.
Fuck this!
You going to kill me, then kill me!
Man.
Prison sure has made you stupid.
Jimmie...
Son...
If you hit a man
In his face,
In time,
His wounds will heal.
And later on,
You can apologize
To that man.
If you steal his goods,
Later on,
You can return those goods,
Or you can repay him
Equal value.
But if you kill...
There is no later on.
There's no way
To repair it
With that man.
There's no way to make it right
with him
Or his family.
His life
Is gone forever.
You never
Come back from that.
Ray Ray...
That boy
You're holding
Is my son.
My son.
I told a man
In prison
That i would
Save my son's life,
Even if
It took my life.
I'm willing to die here today,
Ray...
For my boy...
Because
I love him that much.
Do you love him?
All i want
Is to give him
Something
That you or i
Never had.
A father.
You said...
Out there...
That you owed me.
All i want is my boy.
The court will give you back to me.
Then we're going to start
this whole thing
All over again.
And we're going to do it
the right way.
O.K. With you?
