 and the location of the place]
     - Kandahar Province,
     Southern Afghanistan,
  the birthplace of the Taliban.
  It's 54,000 square kilometres
     of brutal insurgency,
      conflicting agendas,
tribal rivalry and blood feuds.
This is the Canadian Forces area
    of operation. We wear it.
    And every day, we drive
    deeper into the furnace
       of enemy country.
  It's one hell of a rough road.
        - Checking dope,
        up 15 left one.
     - Wind gusts 15 to 20.
         Left to right.
 Hold left hand side of target.
             - On.
   And buddy's got a shovel.
      - Could be a farmer.
          - On a road?
           - Why not?
   - 'Cause it's a road, man.
   - Could be a really shitty
    farmer, like, constantly
       puzzled, you know?
     He's in the village,
    asking everybody, "Why
    are my crops so lousy?"
  No one has the heart to say,
  "Hey, buddy, you can't grow,
   like, anything on a road."
  - Will you shut the fuck up?
           Bad move.
    He's got a shell casing
      shaped like a 122,
        orange det cord
   sticking out of the nose.

      left of the culvert.
       Put a round in it.
       What do you think?
    - It's probably nothing.
           - Hickey, put a round
        in the patch next to it.
        - Could be just
     a bad patch of road.
 - Yeah, what if you're wrong?
- When have I
ever been wrong?
         - My sister?
     - Yeah, that was bad.

            - Clear!
   - Everybody take a corner.
 Three Niner Alpha, 66. Looking
 for status on that ride home?
    - 66, Three Niner Alpha.
   QRF is two-zero mikes out
    and you're danger close
        for artillery.
  You're gonna have to hunker
      down. We'll get you
      out of there ASAP.
       - 66, roger. Out.
       We're on our own.
     - What, they can't get
        anything to us?
       - Not for a while.
   Okay, guys, let's arm up.
        - What the fuck?
  - Grenade. I need a grenade.
       - I got one. Here.
   - Ryan. What do you think
        they're doing?
  - Same as us, getting ready.
      - You see anything?
 - They got an '82 recoilless.
- Oh, great.
       - Everybody okay?
            - Good.
            - Yeah.
        - I'm good. You?
       - What's he doing?
        - I don't know.
- They killed him.
- Gents, it's been a privilege.
          - Likewise.
 - Kill every fucker that comes
      through those doors.
         - Roger that.
       - Hold your fire!
          - Taliban?
         - No Taliban.
- We're safe?
                - You trust him?
        - Let's gear up.
           Let's go!
           Thank you.
            - Clear!
            - Clear!
            - Clear.
 - Where the hell did they go?
   - Three Niner Alpha, 66.
  We're clearing the village.
     - Three Niner Alpha,
 acknowledge. RV Quebec Quebec
        4012 8883. Over.
Zero, this is Three Niner Alpha.
     66 coming home. Over.
      - Zero acknowledge.
            Fuck...
             - KAF.
   You might as well be on Mars
       as in Afghanistan.
    We're out in the middle
        of the desert,
     surrounded by a forest
         of razor wire.
It's a coalition force from over
  forty-five different nations.
    Two-thirds of the soldiers
    deployed here never even
        see the country,
    they just see blast walls
    and defects, Tim Horton's.
    Nobody even knows how many
    people are on this base;
    thirty-five, forty-five,
        sixty thousand.
   It's here, inside the wire,
   that we organize everything
  that goes on outside the wire,
       and half the time
       we got it wrong.
   But that means half the time
        we got it right.
    It's a vast organism that
    consumes 14 metric tons
         of food a day
and shits into a lake that fills
  the air with 30% fecal matter.
      In KAF, you breathe
        your own shit.
     - I'm building a road,
           gentlemen,
I'm building a big fucking road
 and it's going like a dagger
  into the heart of the enemy
   and it is fucking him up.
And every morning
he wakes up,
          and I'm standing there
            and I'm punching him
      right in his fucking face.
 Now we've never been this deep
  into the heart of Panjaway,
      but Hyena Road is in there
    and she is in there to stay.
    And they don't like it,
   'cause we're fucking with
   their freedom of movement.
So they're going after our dump
 trucks and our gravel trucks
       and our workers.
     - What are you saying?
          - I'm saying
     I've lost 36 civilians
  in the last four months and
  this bullshit's got to stop.
 And I'm going to need a little
         help from you.
           - General,
      I am just one man--
- You're Bashir Daoud Khan, BDK.
 You're one man with a militia.
- And I'm your partner in peace.
     - So I need your eyes
         and your ears
         and I need you
       and your son to be
    at our little dedication
   ceremony-- how many clicks
         there, Shorty?
        - Fifteen, sir.
      - Fifteen clicks of
     hardtop into the Horn.
      Your presence there
   would be very meaningful.
                    - Hyena Road
                       is a gift
                 to all Afghans.
           It would be an honour
             for my father and I
        to attend your ceremony.
    - Out-fucking-standing.
     - Thank you, General.
       - Thank you, sir.
    - Look at that little prick.
             He's like Caligula.
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
to get Hyena built if that prick
would stop breathing.
- Yeah, right there
you're right. Look,
I'm gonna hop a flight.
I wanna get out to Sper and
run down a lead on an Elder.
        Tell Armstrong
  I'll call in from the FOB.
- You don't wanna hang with me?
- Oh, you know there is
nothing I'd rather do,
but the future of Western
civilization depends on my ass
getting out to Sper.
              ¶¶¶
Alexander the Great marched into
this graveyard about twenty-five
       hundred years ago.
     Easy to march in; hard
    to march out. His words.
    He and his mother wrote
   to each other all the time.
   And one day he got a letter
from her saying, "What the hell?
"You conquered most of the known
world in like a day and a half,
  what are you doing bogged down
        in Afghanistan?"
      He grabbed a bag and
    shoveled it full of dirt
 and had it sent back to Greece
  with a message to his mother:
   "Take this dirt and dump it
      around the palace,
      see what happens."
- So Alexander's mother spread
the dirt all around the palace.
  Later that night a couple of
  attendants showed up, to make
     sure she was alright.
  One says, go ahead, after you.
    And the other one says,
    no, after you. And the
      first one says, no,
   I insist. And the second one
    says, don't you tell me
          what to do,
and they both pull their swords
       and they go at it
   until they kill each other.
  Alexander's mother watched all
     this and wrote a note
         to him saying,
    okay, okay, now I get it.
And he wrote back, saying, yeah,
    even the dirt is hostile.
In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,
birds fight birds, men kill men.
            - Fire!
     - Mind if I join you?
 - Not at all, Warrant, please.
      Hey, I got an update
       from the Engineer
on that stretch of Hyena
from yesterday. They
cleared 8 IEDs in all.
      Something went wrong
  with the last one-- the guy
  lost his leg above the knee.
They airlifted him to Landstuhl.
    I think we need to talk.
          - Hey, uh...
  Hi, Jenn, sorry to interrupt
 here. Ryan, I'm Pete Mitchell,
    one of the effects guys
at Brigade. Didn't mean to wreck
   your meal, but you mind if
    I have a word with you?
            - Sure.
     Catch up to you later.
- I was in the TOC when you guys
             had that engagement
                   in Haji Baba.
         You were fucking lucky.
  - Come all the way out here
       to tell me that?
             - No.
             No, I came out here
                      because...
  and I could be way out of line
             here but, you know,
     manifestly you and Jenn got
       a little something going.
  On behalf of the entire battle
 group, I'd just like to express
our collective fuckin' jealousy.
- You got a girl?
                 - Yep. Woman of
            my dreams back home.
  - Does she know what you do?
           - My wife?
           No, she thinks I work
                 inside the wire
       and I'm going to leave it
         that way. Let her sleep
                  easy at night.
       Tell me something.
    How much you do you know
       about Pashtunwali?
     - Well, whatever's in
    the handbook. You know,
 it's a tribal code. It's old.
          - Oh yeah.
It's so old they look upon Islam
as a kind of recent add-on.
               - What are those?
- They're dates.
They're local.
They help you shit.
    The code has got a bunch of,
   well, they call them pillars,
                      and one of
                  them is Panah,
       which means 'protection',
                   more or less.
  So when that Elder invited you
into his home he gave you Panah:
   no harm could come to you.
   - So I owe him, you mean?
       - Well, he did it
  for Allah, he didn't do it for
you. But you are still breathing
         so that'd be your call.
                     This Elder,
       did he speak any English?
- No.
Just a couple words.
     - Any marks about him,
           any scars?
             - No,
     but he had weird eyes.
          - Weird how?
       - His left eye was brown.
    His right eye was deep blue.
So who is this guy?
Why'd he... why'd he
give me this Panah?
                   - That's what
                 I want to know.
  I got a patrol going back into
     the village in the morning.
              I'd really like it
             if you'd come along
    with me, help me ID the guy.
  - Yeah, sure, I'll be there.
            - O900.
           - Alright.
           - Alright.
 - I'll see you in the morning.
            - Yeah.
    - What are you thinking?
            - Hmm...
  I'm thinking about our hotel
        room in Cyprus.
            - Umm...
 Okay, I'm gonna say something
and I'm gonna say it for both of
 us and it's going to be shitty
    and it's got to be said.
           - Fuck me.
- You know that I am completely
crazy about you.
And Cyprus was...
Cyprus was perfect.
We're perfect. But we can't keep
doing this. We both know that.
If we get caught,
    I'm gonna get cashiered.
       This is my career.
       - It's mine, too.
- I know, this is what I'm
saying. When we rotate home,
we'll see. But right now, while
we're here, it's gotta stop.
                - So this is it?
- I think it has to be.
                  - This is like
             fucking Armageddon.
           - I know.
   You know there is nothing
    that I would rather do
   than climb over there and
fraternize the shit out of you.
            - Hmm...
               You can't dump me
                 in one sentence
               and say something
          like that in the next.
                           Ah...
- Now, when you get to the grape
    fields, if you see wire,
 you see metal, you see plastic
     or newly turned dirt?
Don't step on it. If you didn't
  drop it, don't pick it up.
 Try to stay at least five body
  lengths between the next man
         in the patrol.
  When we get in the village,
   you're going to see women
       dressed in bags.
 Please don't stare at them. I
 know you've probably seen that
      in Toronto or Paris,
 but you haven't seen it here.
   Here, those bags are like
    magnets for your eyes.
   If you get caught staring
      at them, it's gonna
     fuck shit up for us.
    Quick clot, Tourniquet,
           bandage.
      - I don't know how
      to use any of that.
  - Ma'am, if it has to be used,
       it won't be you using it.
        Salaam Alaikum.
Hey! Eyes.
       - Salaam Alaikum.
       - Alaikum Salaam.
       - This is my PTM.
In my job, it is a great honour
      to meet Elders such
      as yourself today.
            And if you chose so,
               it is a good day.
        But I was hoping to meet
  another elder in this village?
- He insists that "I'm the only
elder and there is no other".
- Strange, because someone
told me there was another
 important man who lived in this
 village, but I forget his name.
        But this person said you
  couldn't forget him because he
had two different coloured eyes.
- Hey! Hey. What's in your head?
        You're too high.
 You can see the women without
their bags. Get down. Get down!
         - Sorry, sir.
 - I think you know who I mean.
    - He says he's a ghost.
   - Even ghosts have to live
           somewhere.
- He says most of them
live in Kandahar City.
     - Haji, what the fuck
         are you doing?
    - The carpets are dusty.
- The entire country is dusty.
 Come on, let's have some tea.
      Step into my office.
   - How are you doing, Pete?
      How is your family?
       How is your time?
   - It's good. How is yours?
   Have you heard from Kabul?
     When will you see 'em?
      - Soon. Insha Allah.
- You're frowning.
 - I thought you were crazy, but
         I was wrong and I don't
               like to be wrong.
                  My cousin says
                maybe it is him.
         - In K-City?
- He thinks so. Why is he back?
      - If it's even him.
        - But the eyes?
- If it is him, do you think
you can get me in to see him?
      - My uncle has arranged it
                   for tomorrow.
- Tell him I'm gonna
bring along another guy,
       the Master Sniper
     with the battle group.
       - One other thing.
     It's not relational--
          - Related.
        - Related, yes.
           I'm hearing something
                about an attack.
          - In K-City?
   - Soon. That's all I know.
     As soon as I find out more,
                I will tell you.
    - Okay.
How are you?
You need anything?
        - No, I'm good.
 - You always say you're good.
- I'm Afghan.
- Oh listen, I got you...
I got you some of that shampoo.
            - What?
- Some of that hand cream
you guys are so crazy about.
  - Thank you, this is great.
  - You're welcome, my friend.
- This is my favourite.
   - Guys, listen up. This is
 straight from the brass. Guys!
   Listen. Alright... No more
    fraternizing with goats!
   You bunch of goat-fuckers.
- Okay, listen up. All four dets
are out tonight, All Ops
are observe and report,
except for you, Travis. You guys
are on that bend in Hyena
where that fucking tree is,
so keep your eyes peeled.
  I've been seconded to intel
  for the day so I'm heading
         into K-City.
 Wilf here is going to step up.
- Nice. Wilf!
                - Alright, I got
                  some bad news.
 They grabbed a couple of guys
from 10th Mountain Dog Company.
            - What?
- Yeah. I don't know the details
      but there was an IED
         of some sort,
        and the Tallies
      grabbed two of them.
       - Are they alive?
            - Yeah.
            - Fuck!
You can blow me up with an IED,
  shoot me with an AK, fucking
    run me over with a LAV--
  I'm fucking fine with that!
  But do not let me be taken
       alive by these...
     fucking medievalists.
- You good?
        - What exactly
      do they do to you?
      - It's unspeakable.
- New comm logs. Fill them out.
     - What do you mean--
            - Hey.
   Unspeakable means we don't
    fucking speak about it.
        - Targets down.
         Let's back up.
       First time, Wilf,
       how do you feel?
            - Good.
         - Ready to go?
        - No, not quite.
      I gotta take a shit.
          - What? Why?
   - Why, I don't know, maybe
   'cause my lower intestine
                is full of shit?
               Give me your bag.
        - Alright, fine.
           - Thanks.
     - What a beautiful night...
You know, if they get this place
        together, I'd come back.
      Bring Joey camping.
          - Camping.
            - Yeah.
         - In Kandahar?
      - Why the fuck not?
- Number two totally offloaded.
          Good to go.
      - Three Niner Alpha,
    this is 66 Bravo. Ready
     for extraction. Over.
         - Let's move.
  - It's a beautiful morning.
   - Has been for two hours.
   How long until the convoy?
    - Should be on the move,
    five, ten mikes, maybe.
     - These A&A Dudes...
     You trust these guys?
- With my life.
        It's their war.
 We're just along for the ride.
         Hey, Walid...
            - Huh?
        - What's he got
      going on the tunes?
        - Leif Garrett.
 - You're shitting me. Come on,
  put it out for all to hear.
            - Yeah?
        - ¶¶ Playin' in

     - Gulf Niner Whiskey,
    we're falling in. Over.
    - We'll take this right.
 - This is Gulf Niner Whiskey,
      we're breaking off.
      Thanks for the tow.
     - Pete, anywhere here.
       - Who is that guy?
   - He's called The Cleaner.
 He's the bravest man I've ever
 known. My greatest ally here.
  He works for us but can't be
   seen with us, if you know
          what I mean.
   His family's up in Kabul,
    and he hasn't seen them
    or slept in the same bed
 more than three nights running
     in the last two years.
     - Why is he doing it?
              - Love of country?
          I honestly don't know.
               Can't just be for
           the money we pay him.
       - Salaam Alaikum.
       - Alaikum Salaam.
              - He says his name
                    is Mohammed.
        - Yeah, of course it is.
     This bread looks very good.
       My friend, Ryan.
     We have been friends,
we have known each other
and loved each other
for many, many years.
        And you helped my friend
    in the village of Haji Baba.
And I would like to repay you
for that kindness.
    Now you must need something?
         Perhaps new prayer rugs
                for your mosque.
 I would like to help with that.
      - How much is that?
       - I have no idea.
   This is for your village.
- He says, "Only a fool accepts
    a gift without knowing
        what it's for."
- There was a legendary warrior,
       a Mujahedeen in the Jihad
     against the Soviets. He was
called 'The Lion of the Desert'.
            - He says he's heard
                    of this man.
   - The word is that he's back.
        He's once again mujahid.
         Have you heard anything
            about these rumours?
    May I ask where you're from?
     - He says his village
    is called Abdullah Jan.
   - Ah, so you're Pakistani?
        - "I've been a Pakistani
                 for many years,
a Muslim for fourteen hundred
and a Pashtun for five
thousand."
                 - I understand.
            If you hear anything
                 about the Lion,
                 I would greatly
                  appreciate it.
      - So he's Pakistani?
             - No.
       No, that was just
        a kind of test.
     Abdullah Jan is just
   the ruins of some village
       across the border
       from Spin Boldak.
  Nobody's really lived there
  for a couple hundred years,
       least of all him.
  - So he's not just some guy
        from a village.
        - No, he's not.
  He's the Lion of the Desert.
     That's what his people
          called him.
 The Russians, they called him
    The Ghost because they
      couldn't kill him.
   They shot him four times,
    they blew him up twice.
         And each time,
 his guys would get him up over
 the mountains and into the Red
    Cross tents in Pakistan.
Then they'd get him stitched up
   and he'd be back out there
blowing Russians out of the sky.
  We just met a very big gun.
              He's like a Rommel
                    or a Patton.
 This guy beat the Red Army, and
    he was a kid when he did it.
               When the Russians
                     pulled out,
I'm going back to my grape
                         fields,
           I don't want any part
       of your stupid civil war.
            Just leave me alone.
Which they did,
and it was kinda weird
because generally speaking,
  the Tallies went after anybody
who stood against them. But him,
       for some reason they just
                 left him alone.
      - But now he's back.
          - He's back,
and I gotta figure out why.
A guy like him, with his
influence? He could prob--
  - We have multiple bombers,
 vehicle borne and coordinated.
 Reporting civilian casualties,
multiple CIV-KIA, city center--
   - Got a VD-IED Southwest
        Kandahar City.
      Multiple casualties.
  - In AIR reports taking fire
       at route one and
       alpha seven-five.
        - Must have hit
       the engine block.
          - Goddamn.
 - Peter, where is the convoy?
      We lost the convoy!
- Zero, Golf Niner Whiskey.
-      I have contact. Over.
  - Yeah, Golf Niner Whiskey.
        We have contact
 - Zero, roger. Be advised we
have reports of multiple SBVIED
     in vicinity of Police
 Headquarters. More to follow.
Golf Niner Whiskey, send.
I advise you, try and exit city,
   move to Camp Nathan Smith,
       ride this one out.
- Golf Niner Whiskey. Wilco out.
   There's another explosion.
           Let's go.
   We're gonna have to move,
          head north.
Goddamn, I can't get the radio--
 - Forget the radio! We'll use
           my MBITER.
   Let's go. We got to move.
     - Fuck. I'm gonna have
          to blow it.
            - Walid?
            - Yeah.
      - Come... come here.
        Behind the car.
          - Frag out.
- Mitchell, grab Walid.
Punch up to that corner,
          cover my 6.
     - Roger. Stay with me.
            - Clear.
            - Dick.
          - Let's go.
         They're moving
    on the fucking rooftops.
        Clear. Let's go.
              RPG!
           You good?
         - Yeah, good.
       - Can you shoot?
   - Me? Fuck no. I'm intel.
  - Zero, Golf Niner Whiskey.
I have PID on multiple hostiles,
40 meters east of last position.
      Engaging. Wait out.
         - Zero, roger.
           - Moving.
          - Covering.
     - Target, one o'clock!
     Target down! Mitchell,
         come up to me.
          - Move it.
         - Go, go, go!
           - Hold up!
- I need you to punch left.
      Down that alleyway.
   I'll cover you. You good?
      - Yeah, good to go.
           - Standby.
              Go!
            - Clear!
            - Clear.
         - This is bad.
    - You piss with the dick
       you got. Move it.
    Changing mags. Cover me.
          - Covering.
           - Moving.
     - Rooftop, 9 o'clock.
             Clear.
         - Shoot him.
     - I don't shoot kids.
            - Clear.
            - Clear.
  - No, no. It's my guy. It's
   my guy. It's The Cleaner.
        Go, go, go, go.
    Haji, where did you get
          this truck?
          - My uncle!
          - Of course.
- I hung around, you never know
       about this city.
   I heard the gunfire. Came
 looking for you. We got lucky!
  - Zero acknowledge. Goddamn.
     - Can you get that in
         to Armstrong?
Ho, ho, ho. That was balls out,
   flat-out fucking insanity.
Five suicide bombers,
a rack of RPGs,
17 dead, 37 wounded.
     I gotta get a coffee.
       - Do we know what
       they were after?
- Yeah. Police Headquarters. We
 just got caught up in it. And
 that is Kandahar Karma, baby,
 that's what that is. And I got
 to say you handled your rifle
like you got ice in your veins.
 - All those Tallies were using
  AKs, which is a great weapon
  if you're in a phone booth.
You work the city a lot?
      - A fair bit, yeah.
     - You got a weird job.
- Oh yeah, and... and you don't?
           - Me? No.
 No, everybody knows the rules:
  you pick up an AK, an RPG,
  you're gonna hear about it.
     There's no grey area.
 - Well, except back home where
  they think what you do is a
  little too... I don't know--
   premeditated. But my shit?
       Hearts and Minds?
    They lap that stuff up.
  It's got a moral ring to it,
  even if it's mostly just PR.
      - You believe that?
            - These people here?
        They got no use for what
               we have on offer.
  They don't want Justin Bieber,
               or Tom Jefferson,
     or our fucking pornography.
    They just want our money and
      a little bit of stability.
      - So how do we win?
     - There is no winning.
   There's just an end state and
      that's gonna get laid down
   by foreign policy, not by us.
- You're a cynical man.
       - Not about this country,
                        I'm not.
    Not about these people.
         - Me neither.
    And I gotta believe that
   if I put a 6-dollar round,
        just one bullet
      in the right place,
   I could change everything.
      - You may be right.
- You gonna
stick around at Sper?
   - No, I'm gonna hop a flight.
            Should grab my gear.
       I'll be in touch.
       - I'll be around.
Don't say anything, just listen.
     I know our situation.
 I know it doesn't make sense.
   But you need to hear this
     from me. I love you.
 Right down to the bone, right
 down to the goddamned fucking
 marrow. You need to know that.
             - Ditto. All of it.
  - Haji, what are you doing?
    - Cleaning the chairs.
      - It's not your job.
    - Well, whose job is it?
     - Well, it's nobody's.
         - This is why
     you have dirty chairs.
  - I need some tea. Come on.
Why would he even agree
to a meeting if he has
absolutely nothing to say?
           - Maybe he just wants
           the coalition to know
                 that he's back.
- Maybe, but for what?
We need to know
who's in that village.
Can you get into the Tazkera
Registry, find out
who lives there?
  - I have an uncle, he works
   in the Governor's Palace.
- God, how many uncles
do you have?
- Many.
           Tell me...
 What do you think of my hair?
 I've been using the shampoo.
- It looks silky smooth
and very manageable.
        - And my hands?
- Soft. Like a baby's bum.
- You're the best.
- Hey there, Chewey.
I need a favour.
I'm looking at a village
at this grid marker,
any events in the last, I don't
know, say the last six months.
       - Come on, Pete--
 - I know, I should go through
Armstrong, but I don't even know
 what I'm actually looking for.
 And I don't feel like doing a
 whole work-up just on a hunch.
 - You want a visual, I assume.
  - Anything with eyes, yeah.
      - I'll let you know.
          - Thank you.
       - Anything useful?
            - Maybe.
       What do I owe you?
- I'll take your beer allotment
   at the end of the month.
- I only get two, same as you.
   - And I'll take them both.
   - Alright, they're yours.
And you can clear all this shit
off. Thanks, Chewey.
               Oh, yeah, and one
                  of these days,
              I'm gonna spool up
                  a fire mission
       and train my triple seven
               on your backside.
            - Okay.
          - Hey, Haji.
      What you got for me?
 - Oh, it's bad. It's Bashir's.
      - You're kidding me.
      BDK owns that land?
You're sure?
 - Alright, listen, can you get
     out to Sper tomorrow?
- Yes, no problem.
   -
   you're just a contractor
   working on a school or...
    I don't know, a fucking
   kite factory or something.
            - Okay.
    - Take care, my friend.
 - Have you had any tenderness
  in your breasts, or nausea,
     or just the spotting?
    - No, just the spotting.
 I'm really managing my cycle.
    I haven't had my period
        in six months.
      I don't know, maybe
     I missed a pill or...
 maybe I'm just being paranoid.
            - Yeah.
     If we find something,
    what do we do? You know
   I'm supposed to report it.
 - Well. I'm asking you not to.
              As a friend, okay?
           - Oh, my.
         - Oh, my God.
            Okay...
- How's Joey?
    - Oh, come on, honestly?
He really misses me?
  -
- I miss you, too, baby.
    - A "wide open prairie"
           miss you.
- Oh, Jesus,
       you have no idea
     how much I miss them.
            Hang on.
- I had to go back because this
op was pretty early in the roto,
but the DETs observed
between 15 and 20 Tallies
moving across the field.
   Because of the force size,
      they didn't engage.
 Company command requested the
   grid. They called it in,
        artillery beat
     the shit out of them.
   - There was some fast air
   in there as well, right?
     - Yeah, I believe so.
       He had two A10s.
- And they destroyed the field?
  - That's what Wart Hogs do.
- Well, see, this matters
because, as it turns out,
the field is "owned"
by Bashir Daoud Khan.
            - BDK?
  - See, BDK leases the field
to the farmer who's basically...
       he's like a slave, right?
  The farmer works the field,
    and then at the end of
       the poppy season,
he's got to hand over 5,000 USD.
Whatever he gets on top of that
       he gets to keep,
   which is probably, like,
  800 bucks, somewhere around
     the national average.
 Now, in this particular case,
    the Tallies go running
       around the field,
 ISAF blows the shit out of it,
and the crop is ruined. And now,
well, the farmer, he's got less
  than Adam before the apple.
  Well, BDK shows up and says,
 "Hello, where's my 5,000 USD?"
  And the farmer says, "Well,
 the crop was ruined, you know?
      No fault of my own."
    BDK says, "I don't give
       a shit, I'm evil.
 I will have my 5,000 dollars.
And you have 'x' amount of time
     to come up with it."
  - Wow, this guy sounds like
         Tony Soprano.
      - Yeah. But without
        the therapist.
         - We Afghans,
 we're not very big on therapy.
    - Alright, so why are we
    looking at this farmer?
   - His name is Abdul Malik.
His father's name is Haji Malik.
      Lion of the Desert.
   - His father is The Ghost?
           Holy shit.
- And we think this is why The
Ghost has returned-- to protect
   the honour of his family.
- And there's some bad history
between BDK and The Ghost.
Now, I don't want things
to go haywire because
I want The Ghost.
I want him to work with us
because he could be
a powerful ally for what we're
trying to achieve down here.
      Maybe we'll actually
        get Hyena built.
    - So, where do I fit in?
- Well, we think the date
for payment is close, yeah?
Two, three days, kinda thing.
So I need eyes on that village.
I need to know about the comings
and goings, the who, the what--
all that kind of thing.
     - Alright. I got my snipers
        spread all over the area
                   of operation.
          But I could re-deploy,
               rotate the DETs--
 two days on, two days off, sort
     of thing. Starting tonight.
- Outstanding!
     - You ever try a date?
        - No, thank you.

                   - Roger that.
         - Hey, Putts?
       Is there something
       you wanna tell me?
 Perry Como? In a combat zone?
      - It was on shuffle.
        - Unacceptable.
Completely inappropriate.
  - You know, I've been thinking
    about what you said about...
            changing everything,
      you know, with one bullet.
                      You really
                   believe that?
    - Yeah, I believe that.
      I'm here, aren't I?
            - Yeah.
                           Yeah.
        - Look at this.
- Okay, what the fuck is this?
- I'm a terrible dancer.
        - You're an unbelievably
                     bad dancer.
    - But I'm a great shot.
     And I've always been.
    Ever since I was a kid.
It might have been irresponsible
  to put a weapon in my hand,
  but people would get hunting
     licences -they didn't
        even have a gun-
   just so that I could hunt
       on their behalf.
I used to shoot hard
to shoot game. Put food
on people's tables
     when times were hard--
     - Sir, Captain Boland
     wants to see you both.
                 - We're on.
 - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha.
          Send. Over.
  - 66 Bravo. We got a convoy
    heading our way. Over.
       - 66 Bravo, three
       white Suburbans,
  coming in fast-- looks like
  they're up-armoured. Over.
  - Three Niner Alpha, what's
   happening in the village?
- 66 Bravo, all is quiet. Over.
- They're not ready,
they got no... Goddamn it.
 - Okay, what's going on here?
      - I don't know yet.
        Get everyone up.
            - Roger.
     - Holy shit. 66 Bravo,
   we've got two VIPs exiting
   the vehicle. First, 40's,
    black hair, bad dye job,
       beady little eyes.
- Can he confirm VIP is BDK?
 - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha.
  Is VIP BDK? Can you confirm?
    - 66 Bravo, confirming.
VIP call sign Bravo Delta Kilo.
 Second civ, Hamid Walid Khan.
 Call sign Hotel Whiskey Kilo.
       Three Niner Alpha,
       this is 66 Bravo.
       We've got Taliban,
         counting four.
  - He's got Tallies with him?
  - A guy like BDK plays both
      sides of the fence.
  - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
          do you have clearance?
      Are they carrying weapons?
- Wednesdays, Fridays, he's
with us. Tuesdays, Thursdays,
he's with the Tallies,
and on days off they're
    both running narcotics.
     negative. No weapons.
    But they're in costume.
 Black turbans, black man jams.
 These guys are not even trying
  to hide who they are. Over.
66 Bravo. We have hostile action
       against civilians.
            - Three Niner Alpha.
         Clarify hostile action.
     - They're taking kids,
         little girls.
- Three Niner Alpha. Do you have
     imminent threat? Over.
     - 66 Bravo. Negative.
   Authorize to engage? I am
getting ready to take the shot.
- No, I'm stepping in.
  66 Bravo, this is Golf Niner
   Whiskey. Sit tight. Over.
        - What the fuck?
        Take them down!
- Unless they pull out weapons,
    we can't get involved.
  - 66 Bravo. I can intervene.
- Golf Niner Whiskey. Negative.
   Unless you see a weapon,
       do not intervene.
      - 66 Bravo. They are
      taking little kids.
- - 66 Bravo.
       Clarify. Are you
      fucking kidding me?
  - Golf Niner Whiskey. Unless
you see a weapon, do not engage.
    - We gotta do something!
  - Your guys will stand down!
        - Jesus Christ!
    - Settle down, Warrant.
             Fuck!
            - Fuck!
- Hey, you're out of line here!
  - Why didn't you override?
     - Because it's an intel op,
 it's their call. It's the rules
of engagement and you know that!
    - It's a fucking crime!
    - Hey, we need to talk.
- No, you know what, we're good.
   We're good. Hey, Mitchell.
What are those girls,
like, 8, 10 years old? Huh?
 And we just stand there? What's
   going to happen to them, huh?
        - They're gonna be sold,
     that's what's gonna happen.
         BDK will hand them over
     to the Tallies. The Tallies
    will put them on the market.
    Whatever they get above five
  they're going to keep, but BDK
     will get his 5,000 dollars.
 And then, I don't know, they're
     gonna end up in some shitty
              marriage in Dubai.
  Or worse, they're gonna end up
    sucking dick in some brothel
       outside of Fort McMurray.
- You know this
and we don't intervene?
   - We didn't intervene because
 we didn't have imminent threat.
             Those are the rules
            of engagement. I had
              to make that call.
 And we didn't intervene because
      BDK is protected by a roof
                 on top of which
is a great big fucking sign that
 reads "CIA." He's their asset.
  Now, if you want to bring down
         our General and fuck up
        the entire battle group,
          be my guest, go ahead,
                      shoot him.
   - What kind of fucking war
     are we fighting here?
- Oh, come on, it's not one war.
 It's a whole bunch of different
       wars. And mine, it's like
                a 3D chess game.
 Half the time I don't even know
        who the fuck I'm playing
                        against.
- We're not
playing games here!
                - No, we're not.
      But we're not here so kids
           can fly kites either.
      - Then what the fuck
       are we doing here?
- We are rolling back the clock.
 And we are stacking the deck so
  this time the complete fuckin'
              crazies don't win.
 Haji, did you get all of that?
  - Yes, the relay was clear.
  He's going to have to react.
      He will make Badal.
  - Okay, Badal is another one
   of those tribal pillars.
It's like... Come on, sit down.
           Sit down.
    Badal basically means, like,
 revenge or... it's like "an eye
      for an eye" kind of thing.
   - It's more about honour.
         If the leader
  of the family cannot restore
      honour to them, then
     he must leave forever.
        So The Ghost has
    no choice. He must act.
    - Now, here's the thing:
   BDK served under The Ghost in
   the war against the Russians.
   The story goes that a Russian
               chopper went down
               and BDK ass-raped
              one of the pilots.
    And as punishment, The Ghost
        embarrassed him in front
         of the rest of the Muj.
- So, you see, Badal continues.
- BDK is a bad guy and he needs
             to be brought down.
        Now, we can't do it. But
      The Ghost can. To do that,
   we gotta boost the stature of
The Ghost. And we're gonna start
        by inviting The Ghost to
    the ceremony for Hyena Road.
      - Put them together?
       Badal is possible.
       - I'm also gonna offer up
         the safe house. If they
             meet on Hyena Road,
it's political. If they meet at
the safe house, it's personal.
      Either way, there's
      gonna be fireworks.
 Okay, there's a flight heading
      back to KAF in about
         10, 11 mikes.
      I'm gonna hop on it.
        Now, I need you
             to set up a meeting
           with The Ghost. We'll
        do it at the safe house.
            And I need your team
           to scope out security
            at the ceremony site
          and at the safe house.
                Ryan. Ryan...
        Don't think I don't feel
   for those girls, 'cause I do.
        And we'll do what we can
                   to find them.
    But right now, in the bigger
     picture, we need The Ghost.
              ¶¶¶
     - Travis said you were
        looking for me.
            - Yeah.
     - Alright, look, I'm sorry.
                 I lost my shit.
   But you know me. And you know
          that most of the time,
 I'm proud about what we do here
         and I'm proud about how
           we go about doing it,
         but... those were kids.
      And if we can't help them,
             what's the point of
                 doing all this?
- I don't have
an answer for that,
and for what it's worth,
I agree with you. But that's not
what I wanted to see you about.
Do you mind just
closing the door?
            Here...
    Have a seat, I just have
     to show you something.
    - What's this?
          - Uh, that's our baby.
         It was Cyprus, I guess.
- That's one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.
The most beautiful thing.
          - This kind of changes
             things, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it changes everything.
  - I think that in terms of the
   brass we're going to be okay,
             because it happened
         while we were on leave,
     but we've got to figure out
            what we're gonna do.
       - Figure out what
        we're gonna do?
We're gonna have a baby.
        - Is that what you want?
- Yeah, of course it's
what I want. More than anything.
         - Okay, good. I'm glad.
       - You know, you're
        making me crazy.
                 - Yeah, I know,
        I'm making myself crazy.
- What did you think I'd think?
 - I don't know, I just was...
     I was nervous. We didn't...
...leave things very well.
- Come here, come here.
We're gonna have a baby.
You sure it's mine?
                  - Niner Niner,
                    TAC on base.
    - Cocks. Another IED hit
         out on Hyena.
  One KIA. A guy out of Kabul,
  father of how many, Shorty?
         - Five, sir.
         - Five. Fuck.
 Fighting these pricks is like
  nailing Jell-O to the wall.
  I cannot keep losing civilians
 if we're gonna get Hyena built,
 and if we're gonna prevail down
there, Hyena's gotta go through.
I've gotta get out there,
    get on the ground, gotta get
         my Leopard II's rolling
        and I've gotta blow them
      fuckers out of their beds.
                 I've gotta find
           their weapons caches.
      I've gotta fuck with their
            command and control,
            and I cannot do that
         bouncing around goddamn
                    helicopters.
          Now that's the kinetic
  imperative, Pete. So I'm gonna
     need a little help from you
   non-kinetic types. I need you
     effects guys to go in there
            and work your magic.
- Understood, sir,
and we are working on it.
My Afghan guy's telling me that
BDK is behind all of this shit.
The more the security situation
deteriorates, the more money
he's making
out of all the gravel trucks
and all the other stuff
he's into us for.
 - Fucking horrible little man.
        - If he was out
 of the picture, getting Hyena
    through would be a hell
       of a lot easier.
         - If he got knocked off
    his perch, I would not weep.
      - Understood, sir.
  - I hear The Ghost is back.
          - Yes, sir.
       - Is he a threat?
- Just the opposite. I think
he could be a powerful ally.
   - I don't care how you do it,
     just make sure my civilians
              aren't getting hit
           every time they drive
     a fucking truck down there.
       - Understood, sir.
        - Thanks, Pete.
           - Haji, what the fuck
                  are you doing?
- What? You can't see
out of these things.
   - There's nothing to see.
- No, not the way they are, no.
       - Okay, get in touch with
   The Ghost. The meeting is on.
      - You have approval?
      - It's always better
     to ask for forgiveness than
      permission, you know that.
                  We'll meet him
              at the safe house.
- This house is a key feature--
 it's our asset, a safe house.
    We'll set up our OP here
         at the summit
    of the saddleback ridge.
 And that'll give us clear line
     of sight to both sides
          of the hill.
    Here, at the safe house,
  and here, where the ceremony
    is going to take place.
      - What's the range?
 - It's comfortable, 1150, 750
 meters both sides of the hill.
    - What about extraction?
      - We'll ex-fil down
         the back side,
 through the grape fields, and
 get picked up on route Hyena.
 - How's this house gonna play?
       - That's unknown.
     There's an offer out
 to The Ghost and BDK to show.
    Intel thinks they'll show up
        either at the safe house
             or at the ceremony.
        So we need eyes on both.
                Alright, this is
                    a tricky Op,
        so I'll take lead. Wilf,
     you'll stand this one down.
    Alright, let's gear up.
- I would like to thank you
for meeting with me.
- He says,
"The honour is mine."
He says, "I'm surprised
to be here. I used to come
to this house many times."
  He's asking you, do you know
  who used to own this house?
         - Mullah Omar.
- He saved his ears
but he lost his eye.
     - What does that mean?
         - Same, same.
       - Same, same what?
   - Same, same, same, same.
       - If you ever need to use
        this house, for whatever
             reason, it's yours.
 There was an event in Panjaway
   the other day, the village
         of Haji Baba.
Two little girls were taken out
 of the arms of their father.
             - And he says, "Why
           have you come to me?"
- Because the little
girls were taken
by Bashir Daoud Khan.
My General is
a compassionate man.
He's a student of Pashtunwali.
And he would like to help you,
to help all Afghans,
to help the village
of Haji Baba.
 And he would be very honoured
 if you would accept this gift.
   Five thousand US dollars.
He would also be honoured
if you would attend
the ceremony for Hyena Road.
         - He's saying, "Why me?
     I'm a simple grape farmer."
- He understands this.
But your presence would do him
a great honour as an Elder
of the region.
  - "Who else will be there?"
- Bashir Daoud Khan.
- "I have known this man,
Bashir, since he was a boy."
"He brought great dishonour
to our cause. And he was
punished by my own hands."
"Thank your General
for his kindness.
And it will be
my honour to attend."
            He says that chicken
                      hates you.
  - Yeah, Haji, it's me. Yeah,
    I'm watching him walk up
    the side of a mountain.
 Yeah, he says he's gonna show
 up, but I got the feeling he's
  got something up his sleeve,
 so I'm gonna need you to get
 your eyes and ears out there,
 see what you can learn, okay?
    Yeah. Wa Alaikum Salaam.
   Okay, let's get our gear,
           we'll go.
- Whoa.
                     Local meat?
       - Heavenly Father,
        please protect
      those little girls.
      And watch over them
      and bring them home.
  - Listen, I'm not sure I was
 entirely clear about all this,
   so I want to spell it out.
  I'd like it very much if...
       if you'd marry me,
        Captain Bowman.
- I would also
like that very much,
Warrant Officer Sanders.
 - Okay, I've gotta go. We're
heading out. I've gotta get up.
- Let me help you with that kit.
    We're crazy.
          - Fucking certifiable.
- Be careful, okay.
                    - I promise.
               You're driving me
                          crazy.
          - Hey, Jenn.
             - Hey.
  So how do you think this is
      going to play out?
    - Hard to say, a lot of
 variables. If the plan holds,
 we're golden. Anything shifts,
           who knows?
    - We got Niner Niner TAC
         en route now.
 - Okay, everybody, here we go.
 General's on his way. You were
   down at the ceremony site?
         - Yeah, on my way here;

   - Alexander the Great fought
      a counter-insurgency
         in Afghanistan
that lasted almost three years.
  And by the end of those years,
    he was drinking heavily
    and completely paranoid.
   One night, he got into a row
    with a guy named Cleitus
    the Black, a loyal friend.
      Cleitus accused him
       of certain things
      and Alexander threw
    a spear into his heart.
  As he watched his friend die,
       he lost his mind.
       Five years later,
      Alexander was dead.
     As the Afghans say...
    You might have the clocks,
    but we've got the time.
