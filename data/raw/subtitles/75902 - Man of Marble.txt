This is a film you want to make...
but do I, or television, or
audiences really need it?!?!
Besides it's full of booby traps
and blacked-out areas...
No one's made a film about
the fifties yet.
I'm not an idiot; I'm very
serious about this.
I'm not interested in doing any
old film for my thesis.
This film needs a good director.
You're very young.
You'll get some old codger who knew
him, saw him, who knows!
This is my subject.
Besides, I've already started it.
I'll give you another one, "steel".
That's what interests us, it's
essential and not hypocritical.
I learned my subject matter
from my father.
I'm giving you good advice.
I have contacts, materials,
interviews, really good stuff.
Young people will be interested...
You're ignoring the facts...
steelworkers, mills, the increases
in steel production...
So you haven't got the
materials for me?
I'm not interested in controversy.
It would be the end of...
me, you and your film.
Those materials have always
been off-limits.
This is bottom line,
understand?
- How old are you?
- 28.
And you have 21 days
to finish shooting.

We're from Polish Television...
Yes, the director told me
to assist you.
The museum's closed today, so I'm
afraid there isn't much light.
What's this film about, anyway?!?!
The director would like to know.
Do you have a script?!?!
Yes, I do.
Director of photography
Directed by
Keep her busy.
What's down there?
Nothing interesting, the
oldest collections.
- Before World War II?
- No, 25 years ago.
We're the only institution
which buys works of art.
- Were they ever displayed?
- Of course.
- Didn't you see them?
- I was born too late.
Where are you going?
Let's go back, there's
nothing there.
I just want to look
around a bit.
- What's going on here?
- I'll explain...
Is there enough light?!?!
We'll manage if we raise it and
put the camera on a tripod.
What tripod?!
Well, well, my dear...
I like that one.
That's strange.
May I ask...
why that one?
There are far better
pieces here.
I don't know.
It's not important.
Could I take some pictures?
Pictures?!
The director doesn't even like...
people visiting here.
Good morning, please
prepare the film.
Hello...
Can you hear me, gentlemen?
Yes, good morning...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Perhaps we could arrange a
hotel room for you.
It'd be cheaper than sleeping here.
Hello.
I've chosen materials which more or
less concern that bricklayer.
More or less.
This stuff's 25 years old and it's
hard to remember everything.
Are you going to sit there
or next to me?
I don't know if there's anything
to choose from here.
It's boring footage.
This is your thesis?
So you think it's boring?
I'm not here to think,
I'm here to splice.
- What did you do at school?
- Short studies.
Cortazar's, of course.
Or maybe your own screenplay?!?!
- Agnieszka.
- I did different things.
I know, life as it happens,
hidden cameras...
Television likes that, audiences
less, but they'll give you a job.
Roll the film, please.
- What do we have here?
- A profile of Birkut, fascinating!
- Have you ever met him?
- Only his statue.
There were better looking guys.
Why him?
I don't know.
Maybe because he was tipped over.
I'd advise you to choose quickly.
Projection rooms are hard to get.
These are outtakes.
They never made it into any film.
For technical reasons, of course..
Hold on, this is called
"A City is Born."
It was supposed to be called that.
A thesis piece too, by Burski.
I haven't cut anything, pretty soon
you'll see Birkut.
Also outtakes.
Here he comes...
That's him.
Birkut, Mateusz.
Where do you come from?
Lencz, a village near Krakow.
Parents?
They live there.
What does your father do?
He has some land.
A lot?!?!
Not much.
Did you work anywhere
else earlier?!?!
On the land.
- So you don't know anything.
- No, I do...
On that land...
What are they angry about?!?!
The fish, I guess.
I love fish.
But only one fish for dinner...
I understand.
- Burski made these kinds of films?
- He quickly stopped.
Now you'll see a fragment
of his film titled:
"Building our Happiness."
I've chosen the parts with Birkut.
The rest is very similar.
Please roll the film.
We're ready.
Building our Happiness.
A film by Jerzy Burski.
The festively decorated main hall
of Warsaw's Polytechnic...
and the annual New Year's
Eve Ball...
for those most deserving:
Party and government dignitaries...
lead workers...
farmers, teachers, and academics.
Among them, Mateusz Birkut, a
leading worker from Nowa Huta.
Mateusz Birkut, from a
poor village...
with thousands of others...
joins the battle for
a better tomorrow.
A huge steel mill is being
built near Krakow...
together with a new city.
This marks the site where,
on April 26, 1950...
the first worker began
construction.
From across Poland, stream...
masses of workers, including
volunteers from the Youth Union...
and Service to Poland.
As the city grows, so
do the people.
They are not alone.
Management lends a hand...
by providing...
worker's hotels...
where, after work, they can
relax and do some reading.
It was here on the
building site...
that Mateusz Birkut...
began, together with other
young volunteers.
Under the watchful eye of
experienced bricklayers...
like Ozanski and others...
he learned this demanding and
beautiful trade.
The honorable title
"builder of Nowa Huta"...
demands not only manual labor...
but academic work too
and everyone can learn here.
Mateusz Birkut took full advantage
of the opportunity.
He worked and studied...
Here is where he met
his future wife.
We know her from the newsreels.
Hanka Tomczyk, the pride of...
Nowa Huta athletes, began like
everyone and leaned to live...
and work here.
The landscape is changing.
Where once were fields...
we now see Nowa Huta, the largest
investment of the 6-year plan.
President Bierut's arrival is
a holiday for the crew.
A warm welcome, applause...
a handshake and a moment
that many...
have dreamed of.
A leading worker, Hanka Tomczyk...
feels distinguished.
It was then that
Mateusz Birkut...
took up the challenge of the
other bricklayers, 30,000 bricks...
laid in one shift.
That was his slogan.
It happened here.
A result like that required
efficient teamwork.
We see it here, a good team.
Many came to watch, to
nervously observe...
Will they do it?!?!
They've done it!...30 thousand...
509 bricks.
The five heroes at the finish line.
Now flowers, handshakes and cheers.
Such was the beginning of his march
to later successes.
Comrades selected Mateusz Birkut...
to be a delegate to the
Builders' Convention...
and later to the Convention
of lead workers.
And so men like Birkut became the
inspiration for artists.
A marble statue takes form...
a symbol of the heroism
of our bricklayers.
An art exhibition at the Zacheta
Gallery in Warsaw.
It is opened by the one whose
statue is the...
centerpiece of the showing.
Mateusz Birkut may claim with
satisfaction that:
"We have played our part...
in the revolution in Polish art."
Indeed.
They were its engine...
raw material, and substance.
The people were now on canvas.
Look at...
the degenerate
works of artists...
from the capitalistic west.
It's no accident they have removed
from the human form...
its shape...
and substance.
Here comes old Krakow,
while right behind...
it's younger sister...
Nowa Huta, as old as
the 6-year plan.
The "Trumanillo" circus was a hit.
Mr. Truman and his friends,
reactionary rats and insects.
Eisenhower and Adenauer
as bride and groom.
Franco dressed as Carmen.
And, kicked out of Korea...
McArthur.
People reach out for...
quickly printed...
leaflets.
As if symbolizing the millions of
hands which, thanks to the...
People's Republic, have received
books and newspapers.
The day long-dreamed of arrives.
They receive their own flat.
One of those which they built with
their own hands and hearts.
Mateusz and Hanka Birkut
have a home of their own.
They are understandably moved.
All around them they see the fruits
of their joint efforts.
In each block of flats there is
a drop of their sweat.
Is that everything?
Yes.
I'd like this shown too.
I found a little filler.
Roll the film, please.
Just a minute...
There's no sound, as
it was never used...
for "technical" reasons.
Roll it.
What was all that about?!?!
I cut and splice film, I don't get
involved with the subject matter.
What happened to him later?!?!
We'll find that out in your film.
I saw the film about Birkut.
You must know it.
- I shot the pictures.
- But Burski made it!
He directed and edited.
That was...
It got an award, it did.
That was a long time ago, 24 years.
I'd like to talk to Burski.
Good idea, Burski likes to
support young talent.
Is he in Warsaw?!?!
No, he's returning from
some festival.
I heard they're going to meet him
at the airport.
It's a good idea to keep
your ear to the ground.
What are you so worried about?!?!
Times are tough, Agnieszka.
I'd like to...
keep working.
But I guess this'll be
my last film.
I've written to the Minister...
with a request to let me continue.
I haven't had an answer yet.
We're ready!
We're not going to use a tripod.
Only handheld and wide-angle lens
just like the new American films...
I was only on the jury.
I'm pleased by the success...
but it belongs to them.
But it's thanks to you that
Polish films are recognized world-wide.
I'm flattered by your opinion,
but it was really them...
There's a woman here from
Polish Television...
But I'm going to Prague today!
Your tickets are all
taken care of.
So you're the television lady?!?!
Just don't ask me about the trip or
the festival; please be original.
I'm doing my thesis.
A film.
What about?!?!
A simple story, here's the title,
"Stars of a Single Season."
Sports stars or screen stars?
Former lead workers.
Then and now.
That's history.
For me, ancient history.
That's why I want to
make this film.
How moving.
And I'm to be granddad
by the fireplace...
telling tales of how we built
Warsaw and Nowa Huta, eh?
That's very moving.
But impossible, as I'm
leaving today.
To Prague, I know.
When I return, perhaps?
What are you doing this afternoon?
Me?
Different things.
Good-bye.
Too bad.
You knew Birkut, didn't you?
Knew Him?!
He was my greatest discovery!
That was my biggest stunt.
You think this Birkut, now...?
I'm simply curious.
The story if his career,
and what followed.
The story of a career?!?!
First some materials from
the archives...
With your permission.
...then a few interviews, cinema
verite, but that's old hat.
I saw one of your earlier films.
Which one?
- "Building our Happiness."
- "A City is Born."
It's too bad you never finished it.
Are you doing a film about Birkut,
or about me?
You see, I don't lament over...
my own, "what followed?"
Anna Maria! Marysia!
Daddy!
You forgot your dog.
Tell me, what's his name?
- Where's my wife?
- Off on a shooting session.
- When will she be back?!?!
- Late...
My dear lady, film, especially a
documentary, is not literature.
There's no tomorrow, everything
is now or never.
You have to know what's important,
have that awareness...
I was once young, as you are now,
and I had to start somewhere.
Nothing worked for two years,
until I finally got smart.
And you made your mark with Birkut?!?!
I wanted to do a film about someone
else, but all the better...
lead workers already had backers.
Older colleagues of mine had every
construction record...
clenched in their teeth
like a bone.
Marysia...?
So I had to think up...
Something to drink?!?!
I needed an idea and so
I thought up Birkut.
At first it was only
a vague outline.
It concerned...
the fact, not the person, and
only took form in Nowa Huta.
I used to go there often, shooting
short pieces for the newsreels.
Hi.
What are you filming today?!?!
We've got new showers.
Warm water and free soap.
Violet-scented toilet bars?
I'll wait till there's shampoo.
What is it?!?!
What have you got for the upcoming
Trade Union Congress?
That.
We're building.
So, you're building.
That's not a stunt.
What's a stunt?!?!
Something hot and loud,
that's a stunt.
Stupal was a stunt.
10,000 bricks in one shift!
Not some "We're building."
I hear you, comrade.
But records are once in a blue
moon, but we have a good crew...
good technology and organization.
In the long run...
Forget that...
Besides, you can have both.
Let's do a stunt for 30,000.
Comrade, you have two hands.
So does a bricklayer.
I'd have to give him two more.
Mr. Jodla, I don't know anything
about laying bricks.
What's the "three-man" system?
You want the short version?
It's like this.
A bricklayer used to work alone,
now he has two helpers.
And they lay 20 thousand?
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.
I've never seen it done.
That's what the papers say.
So give him four, six, eight, ten,
the whole association.
And I'll film it.
It was there, in Nowa Huta,
that I saw him clearly.
We have to find a tough guy,
one who'll last the eight hours.
Who do you think will make it?!?!
Adamowski, Stepniak?!?!
Afterwards we'll send him on
vacation to Krynica.
Hold on, not so fast!
His helpers have to be
the best too.
Before that, in secret...
Are you crazy, lay
bricks in secret?!?!
Sure, for an hour, to rehearse.
The rest depends on how
the work's organized.
If we create the best conditions...
we might just pull it off.
It's midnight.
It's midnight already, Birkut.
You'll never get up tomorrow.
Yes I will.
I can do a lot, if I have to.
We need five.
You think you won't find five
crazies on a site like this?
But we can't blow it.
That's a shit-load of bricks.
We'll lay them.
Just so it's not a circus.
You know, for the camera.
Me, for the camera?!?!
I'm doing it for me, to see if you
can build a house in two weeks.
Why not one week?!?!
Who the hell knows, maybe?
Everybody would have a home...
Yeah, that's true.
So, is it a deal?
Get some sleep.
I can't.
Count bricks, that'll help.
Ten thousand calories a day!
- For how long?
- Two weeks.
What's the matter?!?! ...Eat!
I'm full.
- Just one more slice...
- I can't!
Coffee?
- It's no good, it's bitter.
- So what?!?! ...drink some anyway.
It'll make you stronger.
- All right, half then.
- All of it.
It's real, Brazilian.
I made sure he had the
best conditions.
I'm ready.
With a mug like that?!?!
He needs a shave.
All of them do.
I shave on Sundays.
It's Thursday.
- What time is it?!?!
- It's late.
Send a car into town and bring
back some barbers!
This is Jodla!
Barbers with razors.
We're going to do some shaving!
- Ties?
- No, no...
Cigarette?
I'm glad you're here.
I want to cover some details.
The camera's simply a tool,
it registers what it sees.
I would've shaved yesterday
if you'd have told me.
The barbers will be here soon.
You have to look good...
I understand...
But you can't do that.
I'll do whatever I have to...
But you can't force-feed people
like they were geese.
Fine, now let's agree.
When I say "camera"...
you work lightly and easily.
When I say "stop"...
you work as you normally do.
I'll make it.
All clear.
Who's that?!?!
Just in case.
We have to be careful.
Maybe I'll do it myself?!?!
Maybe I'll do it myself?!?!
Cologne?
Go ahead.
Now back to the barrack.
I can't film them coming out of the
office, and get the audience.
Let the audience go.
This is Polish Radio...
from the residential housing
development in Nowa Huta.
We are located at the largest...
construction site of the 6-year
plan, a steel mill...
and city for 100,000 residents.
Before Polish workers start up
the Soviet machines...
Polish bricklayers are going to
attempt an ambitious feat...
Ready?!?!
Energetically, go on, easy does it,
more like workers!
Mr. Birkut looks good,
the rest are too stiff.
That's not it.
Back inside.
Let's try it again.
Mateusz Birkut's brigade...
aims to lay 28,000 bricks during
the course of one shift...
The crew consists of five men.
One man lays only the exterior
layer of bricks...
directing the others,
who do the rest.
Working alone, one man can lay
1,750 bricks, at the most.
Mateusz Birkut's brigade
will lay 28,000.
Feelings are high...
and shared by all those present...
Ready!
Start!
What are you doing?
Let's do it again.
Go to the office.
The battle against time has begun.
We see a perfect example
of organization and...
enthusiasm which these boys have
brought to this difficult task.
Happy!...Happy!...Great!
We see their toil and
we all know...
that this achievement
is possible...
thanks to the self-sacrifice
of our heroic working class!
We have the first results...
We're rolling!
Smile!
Let's see your face!
Mateusz Birkut's feat may
launch a revolution
in construction techniques.
It's not only a building foundation
which is being laid...
but the foundations
of a new life...
and prosperity for working
people as well.
Are you falling asleep?
Start playing!
What's going on?
Come here!...Hurry up!
The next stage, the sixth layer.
They've been working
for four hours.
13,926 bricks have been laid.
Briskly and more cheerfully...
Briskly and more cheerfully!
Hurry up!
Everybody's waiting!
Stand up here and start playing.
Play, play!
Polish Radio listeners...
the sixth hour of work...
has now passed.
The tenth layer is finished, a
total of 23,210 bricks.
One more hour.
What's wrong?
They're doing fine.
I'm worried about them.
It's going well, they'll make it.
The battle against time and
fatigue continues.
We've reached the final minutes...
the final bricks, the final effort.
- There's no more mint tea.
- But it's going well.
The shift is over!
30,509 bricks!
An incredible record!
Birkut's team not only laid...
the 28,000 they said they would...
but a great many more!
Shift's over!
Shift's over.
Our sincere congratulations.
It's a moving moment
for everyone.
I'm sorry.
What a man!
Stop, let's do it again.
Take the flowers.
Birkut, look lively and happy!
Two more bricks, then come down.
Another achievement in the fight
for the 6-year plan and for peace.
You'll go far, I'll see to it.
I'm keeping this brick
as a souvenir.
I didn't lie, he did get far.
You both did.
Well, sure.
- But he...
- Where is he?
You're making a film about him and
you don't know where he is?
I have this idea...
- of following his footsteps.
- Interesting, but it's been done.
So what?!?!
Tell me more.
I lost track of him.
I had work, trips abroad...
How about having dinner with us?
I saw his picture being taken
down in a newsreel.
It happens.
They put them up, take them down.
Wait...
he hired a bunch of Gypsies.
They followed him, played music,
he broke a window somewhere...
Ask around, lot's of people
knew him.
I can give you an address.
OK, a letter of introduction too.
Are you going somewhere?
It's everything I own.
Not much.
It's easier to make films that way.
Perhaps you're right.
Testing, one, two, three.
Make sure you get it down.
Testing, one, two...
I want to leave.
Wait a minute!
Quit shoving!
Where are you going?
To Mr. Michalak, the director.
Where are we going, and what for?!?!
This is absolutely crazy!
Mr. Michalak?!?!
Mr. Michalak, I have
a letter for you.
- Strip tease or topless?
- Everything, if you help me.
Please get undressed.
Please listen to me.
I'm making a film and Burski
gave me your name.
I'm having problems and
I need to talk to you.
You're the only one who can...
Later.
But it'll only take a few minutes.
They have their models, big butts
are what count, to land softly.
Very good, today's youth is
much better looking.
So you're interested in Birkut?!?!
That's good, young people should
know their fathers' history...
and learn from their mistakes.
Well?
I'd like you to tell me.
You know which period interests me?
I should think so.
From the time he was burned?
Everything was fine until then.
Truth was he no longer laid bricks.
He didn't have the time.
They moved him to the inspectorate,
to the association.
I felt then that it wasn't for him.
What?!?!
The inspectorate.
He took everything too literally.
What, I don't understand?
In what sense?
Well, you know...
Could I have a cigarette?
Of course he had a few
worthwhile ideas.
safety shoes...
a dining hall...
but later...
Although judging it today...
...even I...
never mind.
After the incident...
he went off the deep end.
It happened during his last
trip to the field.
He used to make these long trips
demonstrating team bricklaying.
It took a lot out of him, so we
limited these visits.
If the area was well prepared,
he'd go alone.
If not, he took along helpers.
Ever onward young Slavs,
onward Greeks and young Spaniards.
Young Chinese join the
march from Asia.
Others soon there will join ya...
Negro brothers from Virginia
and heroes hurrying from Malaysia.
Listen to this.
Three neighbors from the village,
off to work they went.
While two worked, the third
laughed with merriment.
Hard work doesn't pay at all,
it's time that is misspent.
Lying in a cozy hammock...
is a job for Michalak,
Oh, they did lament...
Oh, they did lament.
This song is about Nowa Huta
about Nowa Huta these words.
So simple and pretty and new
as lovely as singing of birds.
We're here.
Just a minute...
Whose first?!?!
Start!
Hold it!
Nobody moves!
Get away!
To the clinic!
I'll find whoever did this!
Nobody moves!
Good evening, comrade.
Can't sleep?
I understand.
It's hard to sleep after
something like that.
Did they take good care of it?!?!
Put iodine on it?!?!
No.
- They poured water on them.
- Hydrogen peroxide?
We'll check into it.
Does it hurt?!?!
Sure it hurts.
What do you think?!?!
How could a worker do it
to another worker?!?!
Don't people understand?
They want houses, but doing it the
old way will take a hundred years.
We're cranking up the quotas.
No everyone likes that.
And you...
didn't you feel the brick was hot?!?!
- I had gloves on.
- Thick ones, I bet.
