- Hi, motherfuckers.


the incumbent mayor, Mr. Lapidus, launches a new project
for industrial zone.
- There is the mayor on TV. 
Come translate.
* -Why This choice
on Hubert's site?
* -Well.
In order to attract companies
to settle near production sites.
Hubert seems ideally located.
- But that's only wood!
* -According To our forecasts,
hundred jobs could be created,
in the coming years.
This is a new era.
I want to say:
GO Lassay!
- He wants to get back the 
agricultural land, this crazy!
- And the forest.
There is the mall too.
- I'm going to defend myself, me. 
He'll see!
- What are you going to do?
Stand for election?
No, but you kidding?
- We can beat him together.
- A coalition, the four of us?
- The Belier family!
- You're the greatest, Dad.
Horn.
- What's going on?
- Nothing. There is nothing.
Horn.
- Yes, I see.
- It's just that...
This election thing ... 
I don't know if it's a good idea.
- Why? 
Because I'm deaf?
This is not a handicap to be deaf. 
It is an identity.
- To be a politician, 
it is not very practical.
- And Obama, then? 
He is really black.
- No correlation!
- It was not a handicap 
to become president, perhaps?
- Yeah ...
- The family ...
- Hello. - Hello.
- We come to apply. - Of course.
That's it. - Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- WELCOME Mr. Belien. - Hello.
...
...
- What do you mean, who I am?
I worked with the greatest French singers!
10 years that this fucking rector is refusing me Paris
and I am dying in the middle of nowhere with bumpkins
who think that Gérard Lenorman is from Normandy!
And if you ... What? No, I want to talk to the rector.
It's too much to ask? Pull your fingers off your ass
and pass it to me !!
Hello? Hello?!?
- Damn. - he must be all alone, Thomasson.
- You don't want to volunteer?
This summer? Or a job where we can make some money.
- Why not. do you have a snack?
- I have a Snickers.
- No, disgusting. - My God!
- Noo ...
- Bitch. - I'm not there.
Paula moaned.
- This is nothing ... It happens.
- Let's go.
- No. - Come!
Let's go! - Stop!
- Well then?
So the juniors, not briefing the newbies?
Go, in class.
- I hate my life.
- Good luck.
- Come on, sheeps. - Hello sir.
- Hello.
So.
I rebuke for two years to make a choir sing with
broken voices. Except four or five and the Parisian,
Gabriel Chevignon, This No Man's land !
Anyway I'm punished for I-don't-know-what I did in a previous life.
We will challenge fate and tackle
a monument.
- Michel Sardou ...
- We will work on  Michel Sardou's repertory until the end of this year.
Yes Yes.
When things go wrong, and there is no hope,
Michel Sardou is the solution.
- We can not change?
- Why? That's not good enough for you?
- There's more modern.
- Modern?
Michel Sardou is to the French variety
what Mozart is to classical:
timeless.
Pass.
She runs, she runs The disease of love
In the heart of the children
From 7 to 77 years old
She sings, she sings
Insolent River
Uniting in its bed
Blonde hair, gray hair
- What's going on? We disconnected you?
I hear nothing, I feel nothing.
You do not breathe. Nothing happens!
The technique ... I do not care!
You, the new little girl. Come.
- Me? - Yes.
Sit down.
The ventral breathing, heard about it?
- No. - No?
Spread your feet. That's it.
Plant the sacrum.
Press the pelvic floor.
Open your ribs.
Open. That's it. Breathe. Again.
You feel your diaphragm moving?
- Yes. - Good.
Concentrate and repeat with me.
Ready?
Piano.
- She runs, she runs
The disease of love
- It's not your voice.
- hmm yes.
- No, it's not your voice. Do what I do.

He sings the notes.
She sings the notes.
- Relax the shoulders. That's it. Let go.
Higher notes.
- No eyes.
Straight ahead.
Higher notes.
- Yes, it's starting to come!
Higher notes.
- Open. it's coming.
Higher notes.
- Excuse me.
- It was about time!
...

- Your lap belt. Open. Wide.
Don't sings for your self in the mouth.
What's your name again?
- Paula Belier - Paula Aries.
You are a fucking soprano.
- Of course. - Take it as you want.
But there is someone to wake up inside.
Paula Belier!
Come here. Come.
Would you be up to do a duet together?
- Hmmm ...
- Yes Yes. - Very good.
Learn this song by heart.
Play it out.
- What is it, "I'll love you"?
- "I'm gonna love you." What is it?
A monument. Thank you, Miss Belier.
Gabriel, let's get back to work.
Think about what I said.
Piano.
- Dear parents, I fly
Understand that I fly
Without Smoke
No Alcohol
LI fly, I fly
...
She screams.
A shrill scream.
A serious sound.
A high-pitched.
A very serious sound.
...
- Thank you. Goodbye. - Thank you. Good day.
Yeah, that's good. This is bold.
Yes, no ... it's great!
Between the two, who do I choose?
I'm not voting.
- AH, MR BELIER!
So, is it moving forward this campaign?
A beautiful poster! - Cheese, Mr. Mayor?
- No, thank you. No thank you.
I congratulate your father.
- He congratulates you.
 - What a little shit!
- What ...
- He thanks you.
- It's nice. Me too.
- I'll smash you.
- What?? ...
- He is asking you if you are ok.
- Yes. I am delighted to have such an opponent.
The victory will be even greater.
- I'll blow you the two legs.
- Stop!
- I'll take some cheese. - Yes.
- Not strong. - But no.
- Say.
Your father thinks that people will vote for a deaf?
- Why not. They have already vote for an idiot.
- It is very elegant, miss.
it promises
a high-level campaign. Forget the cheese.
- Yeah ...
- Over there. Good ... Come on!
- I told him you were going to smash it.
- If you do what you have noted,
on schools and housing, it will bring you the votes.
- Rudolph, you got no chance.
Nobody supports Lapidus, but you'll lose.
- You do not know the story.
Telling him "impossible" will motivate him more.
He wanted to take his uncle's farm.
I told him "impossible".
We lived in Fresnes, though.
When he announced to my parents,
they also said "impossible".
When he has an idea in mind, you better be
behind him
and not in front- I support him.
I vote for him.
- Yes, we need to support him.
- But during this time,
Lapidus distributes grants.
We, we are nice, but what is it for?
- Guys, me, I believe in it.
I have the ability.
Although I have 1 chance in 1000, I tried.
I decide my fate.
- That's good. Perfect.
"The disease of Love" speaks of the love with a capital "L".
And there is no love in your voice.
it's never happened to you, pimply?
You don't know those shudders that twist the guts?
Has to come out, it drains,
otherwise it will rot. You'll all die of colon cancer.
The song is your manure pit. So feel it, damn it!
With your guts.
Yeah right, go. Out.
You learned the song?
- Yes. - Yes.
- Very good.
So ready? 3, 4, ...

A tradition among the Jews? We are not Jews.
- Well, I'm going.
- You do not want to ...
- Thank you. Bye.
- Fuck!
being deaf
does not excuse everything!
You are pissing me off!
- He saw the stain? - I don't know.
I want to be a mouse or broccoli, but not me!
- He is a guy. He won't figure out.
- I'm sure he didn't get it. He just came for a slow dance.

- When doing java, Saturday on Broadway
We dance on the sidewalks
- Come On. This is the java!
Come On! That's ... - On blows of watering
And we do not know at noon
- That's good. Let go!
- If you are in Clichy - Broadway!
- Or in California
When doing java Saturday on Broadway
as it swings in Meudon
We just go crazy, no need for Beaujolais
When we have some bourbon
This may not be the true reality
the java of Broadway
Yes, but that's the one they like
- You have a gem in the throat.
And she is angry, your gem.
Would to like to learn singing in Paris?
- Me?
- 10 years that my students fail the contest,
but with you and ...
Gabriel? Come.
With you and Gabriel we have our chances.
The competition is in three months, after the show.
- 3 months ...
- It's short, but you will get there. There's some work.
You have a gift.
- If I am taken? - You will go to Paris,
the opera, the best teachers ...
while continuing high school.
So what? What do you think? what a dream, right?
- No.
- Wait. Paula ... The door slams.
- Mathilde!
- I'm coming!
- Sorry, but ... - No, everything is fine.
Well, what's going on?
Call you later. See you.
It's amazing! - I can't go to Paris.
- But why?
-  My parents ... - Stop.
They are deaf, not puppies. How were they doing before you were born?
You want to do this school? - I think so.
- You think or you're sure? - I'm sure.
- So take the competition. You'll see later.
- Yeah, but ... - Stop. This is good.
You don't want to spend your life here, eating cheese?
You got a gift. You realize?
Damn, my best friend has a gift!
...
- You're scared?
...
- Mr. Thomasson? - Yes. Two seconds.
What is it?
- OK for the contest.
- Are you sure? - And you?
- Sure. And your parents? - They are not against.
- Good, but it will not be "cool".
Many are called, few are chosen. Will have to work.
You are aware? - Yes.
- Very good. See you every night at 6 pm
 including weekends until the contest. We agree?
- Yeah. - Very good.
So see you tonight.
13 chemin de la manufacture au Horps. Don't be late.
- Yes.
I've called you as soon as I could, Ms. Delton.
This is normal, the overdraft. The cooperative has not paid us yet.
What? I don't know. Ask them.
Goodbye. Thank you, Ms. Delton.
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
- Hi.
Don't say Hi!
- Put it there, Paula.
You can put your stuff there.
You thought of a song? - Not really.
- Here you go.
- "I fly"? This is the song of Gabriel.
- Yes. Gabriel won't pass the contest this year.
- Really? - No, he molted.
- He molted? - Yes. He lost his voice.
The rules are strict.
A boy who molted can not apply to the contest.
- Actually, I know ... It's my fault. We had a fight ...
- No
The land doesn't revolve around you.
You will soon realize.
- For the duet,
what do we do?
- The choir? He can do it. Well, let's start.
The song is not so easy.
- Can we do "by Singing" instead? I know it better.
- OK.
If you want.
- Thank you.
- Good? Go.
- When I was a little boy
I was learning my lessons
Singing
And many years later
I was chasing my dark thoughts
by Singing
This is much less worrisome
To talk about the weather by Singing
But it's so cute
To be called an asshole - Although ...
- In the song - That's good.
- Life is more fun
This is less hopeless
by Singing
The first girl
in my life on the street, I followed
- Wow! - Singing
- Vote Belier!
When she undressed
I played the old habit
Singing
I was so pleased with me That I made love 10 times
Singing
I can not explain That one morning
she has left me
ENCHANTED
- Love is more fun
This is less hopeless Singing
- That's good. Breathe there.
- All men go to the galleys
In war or ... Sorry ...
- Go on.
- Singing
The flower at gunpoint
The victory also won
Singing
We do not talk to Jehovah,  to Jupiter, to Buddha
By singing ,Whatever opinions
Obama!
we make the revolution
using Songs
The world is more fun ...
This is less hopeless singing Oh!
- Okay, okay.
- Three mistakes ...
- It's the 1st time.
We must start somewhere.
It's not the competition. how do the others?
What is the job?
- Uh ... - What is it?
We make mistakes, we fall, we go on.

Asshole ...
- Need to go. I am going. - What?
- You stop the choir? - Why does that matter to you?
- And the competition?
- I'm fine. Leave me alone. - It is me who should
be angry at you. - Alright.
- For you! - You got what you wanted.
- What are you talking about? - You're going to pass the contest!
- But it has nothing to do!
Oh, I speak to you, there!
Mom?

- Paula! Smile! Think of your beloved ... Super!
- He signed and I translate. - OK.

- Super.
Are you ready?
Mr. Belier, you decided to stand for
the municipal elections of Lassay.
Why?
- In recent years, 
 businesses close.
Our young people are leaving.
There are no more doctor 
and the school is deserted.
You think what? 
I'll let fate?
By being all together
we will reinvigorate Lassay 
and give it a new impetus.
- I want to give a new impetus to Lassay.
- But you are deaf.
Don't you think it is a handicap to be mayor of a village?
- Absolutely not.
being deaf has never stopped me 
from working, or living.
Why would it prevent me 
from being mayor?
- No.
Not at all.
- You're sure to translate everything?
- Yeah, I translate everything. 
As usual.
- Why  does she make​this face, 
then?
- Your father is right. it's not going there.
- I don't know, 
why she's making this face.
- Can we take Again?
Can we?
- Translate.
- We will proceed differently.
You will subtitle my answers.
You will find someone
to translate what I say.
If you speak slowly,
I'll read your lips.
If we do not understand each other, you'll write.
- Okay.
- Thank you. You can go.
- So, you ...
OK. Let's go on.
Mr. Belier ,
you complain about Lapidus project ...
Thunder rumbles.
...
- Mr. Thomasson! It's me, Paula!
Sir?
Sir. ?! - Are you kidding me?
- It's not my fault. I was delayed.
- It's not a self-service here!
Go back home and question your commitment.
- Open! It's raining, please!
Fuck!
Oh...
A door slams.
- To apologize to Dad? For what?
To have a life?
Ah, I'm exhausting you?
- It's great to have a lover, 
but we are waiting for you.
- I'm not in love.
I have something important to tell you.
No, I'm not pregnant.
I present the masters of Radio France.
A singing school in Paris.
Mr. Thomasson, my singing teacher, think I can get it.
Yeah, in Paris.
No, I don't want to go to Paris.
This is the school that is in Paris.
Yes, I sing and I belong to
the choir of the school.
For 3 months.
Yes, 3 months or so.
He did not know.
I was afraid you thought I abandon you.
I'm a baby? You told me that I was a woman!
I had my period twice
 Thank you.
For high school, I manage.
I repeat every evening at my teacher's.
You understand what?
The farm, the market,
Dad's Campaign ... How to organize?
We must think about another solution.
What, my brother?
He's big, strong and I trust him.
- What do you think, you?
- You go to sleep? Daddy!
No, I'm not happy.
- I will be able to take her room?
A door slams.
- Our daughter wants to become a singer. 
Do you realize?
- And then? She sings!
- She is in danger.
And this is not Holland 
who will save her.
His teacher says 
that she has a beautiful voice.
- Because you have already heard, 
you, her voice?
- Very funny!
- She just started. 
Maybe it'll pass her.
- Oh yes?
Imagine if she is taken.
All alone in Paris.
- This is not what scares you.
You're afraid that we 
are going to be all alone here.
- You know that's my baby.
- You baby, 
she bleeds from her kitty anyway!
For the farm, take a clerk.
We should have done it
long ago.
- It will be perfect! Thank you.
Stop, I do not want.
that's enough!
- With this finger. Cheese. - Ah OK.
- There.
You make a "c", the yoghurt pot. Yogurt.
- Oh, you eat, actually. - Yeah, that's it.
Forget it. The most important is to count.
that's "euro". - Euro.
- 1 euro, 2 euros, 3 euros...
- 3 euros, 4 euros ...
Yeah. - Okay. That's it.
What?
He wants to teach you to sign.
You take me for a Kinder? - It's not stupid.
That way you study your Spanish.
- Good. OK.
Touch a hair of my girlfriend and I kill you.
- Thank you, Miss Belier,  to honor me with your presence.
Did you rehearse? - Yes.
One question, why Gabriel is not coming anymore?
- Why? You don't speak with him anymore?
In your opinion? He is depressed, unmotivated.
Even in the shower, he is not singing.
- We can't do anything? - I do not know.
- For the choir, the duet?
- He decided to stop. I'm not responsible.
Yeah, what a mess.
The duet, you will do it alone.
Yeah, well ... let's start?
- I really have a gift?
- Paula, doubt everything. Never me.
Agree? - Yeah.
it was?
Yes. Matilda, the market ...
Oh yeah, you sold nothing .
And you don't have sex anymore? What's the connection?
Is that me? it has nothing to do!
Mathilde, a disaster? Stop!
Your face, what is it?
Eczema.
It is nervous?
She is a beginner. Give her some time. She is intelligent.
There!
If it doen't work, It's your fault. You make no effort.
Mathilde laughed. - I ride you?
Oh no, I'm in love ...
- I'm not bothering you? - Oh, we kidding.
I have not been really good at the market. - Thanks, I'm aware of it.
- Your brother continues to give me lessons.
- Great!
- OK...
You ...
Well, I'm going.
Bye, Quentin.
See you tomorrow.
I saw Stéphane at the market. - You hooked up?
- He told me 
that Gabriel had an accident.
- And is he okay?
- Yes. He stoled the car of her grandmother on landed on a roundabout.
And he talked about you.
And I didn't hook up with Stephane.
- Excuse me, I become dumb.
Paula moaned.
Spatula pat on the pan.
is it you who slept on the couch?
Well ...
ok, bye!
- Let us see each other this summer.
- I am going. Have fun. - Bye.

- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, I look nothing. I watch what I want.
You're not going to class? - You understand quickly.
- If not, are you ok? The accident? Who was there? Your grandmother?
- He was my father. Are you stupid or what?
- I can not help if your voice molted. - What are you talking about?
- Why did you stop the show?
- Do not worry, bullshit? - No.
This is the first time I miss class!
- Your parents are interested in you. - Your father leave you alone.
- Or he doesn't give a crap.
We take the car and we drive to Paris.
- Of course!
- You do not want?
- Really? Stop, you can not.
- Why? you don't have the balls! - You're a guy, you!
With the car of your granny, you drive without a license.
- So we go?
- Oh my! it will solve all your problems.
- What do you do? - I leave. You're annoying me.
- Ma, me, mi, mo, mu
A, e ....
Mom, I told you to knock!
My sweater!
It has shrunk!
Yes, it has shrunk!
Sorry, my ass!
No it was not too big. I'm not small.
To get me used to do laundry?
To live alone? I am not gone yet!
Where are we? You always upset.
Which solution?
But ...
Rossigneux will translate the meeting?
I thought he was a shame for the deafs?
- we learn 
to live without you.
- I'm not dead! I'm here.
I told you that I'll help you.
Yes, I'm busy, but ...
*-Test, test.
One two.
- My wife told you 
to make an effort on your outfit.
- You do not like my stripes? It's my wedding suit.
- I don't get it, I rehearsed all week.
- I do not understand. Remember Mike Brant.
He spoke no French. He didn't understand what he was singing.
And suddenly, he was sublime!
The problem is that you think too much.
Try to be dumb.
Huh?
Yeah.
Mike Brant.
- The hearing! The hearing ...
The sight. The sight ...
The mouth.
Taste? Yeah!
Taste.
Hubbub.
...
- Thank you! Ah, hello!
...

...
- Ah!
Hello everyone.
Yeah, welcome everyone.
- Breasts?
Nipples.
Tits!
OK.
Rub?
Uh ... Scratch? itch?
Hmm ... How ...
Cuddling? Cuddling, OK.
Cuddling, yes.
Mathilde moaned.
She laughed.
- Come On!
- It's part of my priorities.
- You plan to do anything for my Internet connection?
- Nothing.
Your farm is 2 km from the highway.
If you want Internet, you will have to move.
- No one will vote for you!
- He is right. Stop complaining!
- OH!!!
- Lapidus gave you the wrong habits.
We talk about the community.
It is written: "I hear you."
This is not to listen to your bullshit.
- It's crazy!
- He lost, Belier!
- What? It's hot?
It's odd, that. This is ...
Normally, it is not like that.
What? it burns?
I take it off.
And ...
something's wrong with the color!
Quentin?
- We need to open up to the world. Open yourself.

- You are like plucked chickens.
- Mathilde, not now!
- Your brother fainted. He woke up.
Yes, he is breathing!
Hubbub.
- You are disabled!
- This is an anaphylactic shock.
It's like an allergic reaction.
- Quentin has an allergy.
Allergy to what? - To latex, I guess.
Goodbye.
- How much we owe you?
- Do not worry, go. - Thank you.
You can bring her back? - Of course.
- I can not take more of your Mathilde.
...
- Do not say "assholes." This is your voters.
we are assholes?
You were not let down. Quentin has an allergy.
He sleeps in his bedroom. it goes.
Mom? Pff ...
Mom, what do you do?
Mom, you cannot stay like that!
Let go.
- I have not been 
a good mother to you.
I tried to convey to you 
the family values.
But it could not 
work between us.
I am deaf.
It's my fault.
I failed everything.
- You're not a bad mother. You're the perfect mother!
- Why do you want to go to Paris? 
- Mom!
- It was for me to go with you 
to the end.
What did I miss?
- On the contrary!
It is thanks to you and Dad that I managed to make that choice.
You gave me the keys.
- At your birth, when I knew 
you were with hearing ...
Do you remember?
I cried so much!
 I could never bear
the hearings!
This is your father who comforted me.
He told me: "Do not worry.
"She will be deaf in her head.
"We will raise her as a deaf.
"With any luck, 
she won't hear anything! "
And now you sing?
Luckily you are not
allergic to cow's milk!
- Okay!
I have to sell cheese in my life
because I don't have the chance to be deaf?
That's what you see
when you look at me?
And you don't say anything?
- What for?
All right, go . 
we will be very well the two of us.
...
- Paula? It was not an appointment. Yes ? Well, come on.
- I stop. - Huh? How?
- I can not pass the competition in Paris. - Ah. Why this?
- It's not for me. - Oh! I understand.
All great artists have that. Nicoletta before a concert,
she was in a state ...
- I'm not a great artist.
- No, it's true. You're a little shit.
- Maybe. I stop. That's it.
- No no. That's not all, not.
You think you just stop, but you're digging a hole.
You lie in it and cover with soil.
I know him well, this hole. I am in the same cemetery.
- And then? I do what I want. This is my life.
- Your life, you are sure?
- Yes.
- Think. Please.
- I stop.
Loulou, Obama! Mooing.
Come On!
Come On.
...
- Let's go 
for a ride?
- Where?
Hairdresser?
Yeah.
Yeah, it makes me happy.
Meuglements.
...
Hubbub.
- Mathilde, you corrected me?
To walk along the seaside
it's a good idea.
- Is a good idea.
- OK. Is a good idea.
- Idea.
- Can I sit? My grandmother sold her car.
- Great.
- You speak in code? - I went back to the choir.
- Since when? - Since a girl shouted at me like shit.
And besides, she left.
you okay? - No.
- The duo was taken? - Grave!
- Stop! Leave us alone. Thomasson did not tell you?
- He did,  you're not passing the contest.
- I have nothing to do in Paris.
- Yeah, attend a contest in Paris, it's stupid.
You're right
Our duet is not in Paris.
So ... - No. Thomasson will ever want.
- He is the one sending me.
So what? - Yes! Yes!
- No. What do you think?
- It could be great.
- OK.
But we rehearse at your place.
- OK. - Damn!
You are not simple.
Well, I leave you.
- Wait. - I don't have time.
- no time? Mathilde! Wait!
- Mehdi! What a dumb ass! Your shirt is inside out.
this cannot be unforgiven in showbiz! Come On!
- A, e, i, o, u...
- Are you too stressed? - Nicoletta.
- It will go well.
- Good evening everyone. Welcome. What a privilege ...
- We are waiting for you.
- Ok...
- How do you feel?
- Uh ... Wonderful! As usual.
Uh ... Come on.
It's Showtime.
- Showtime.
- Showtime!
Good evening!
Good evening, good evening.
Good evening. Thank you.
Tonight,

Thank you.
The kids worked hard.
They are there for you. Welcome them.
 The choir!
When doing java Saturday on Broadway
as it swings in Meudon
We just go crazy, 
no need for Beaujolais
When we have some Bourbon
This may not be the true reality
The java on Broadway
Yes, but she likes
Music.
When doing java Saturday Broadway
as it swings in Meudon
We just go crazy, there will no need for Beaujolais
When we have some Bourbon
This may not be the true reality
The java on Broadway
Yes, but she likes
AH!!!
She runs, she runs
The disease of love
In the heart of the children
from 7 to 77 years old
She sings, she sings The insolent river
Uniting in its bed
Blonde hair, gray hair
She blackmails men
And expand the world
She sometimes suffer
Throughout a lifetime
She is crying women
She is screaming in the background
But the most painful
That's when it heals
All men go to the galleys
In fishing or war
Singing
The flower at gunpoint
The victory also wins
Singing
We do not talk to Jehovah
to Jupiter, to Buddha
By singing
Whatever our opinions
we make the revolution
Using Song
The world is more fun It's less
hopeless by Singing
- Thank you. Thank you for them. Before leaving us,
we have one last surprise.
Paula Belier and Gabriel Chevignon are going to sing you 
"I will love you."
They are changing, but they should be here.
Here they are.
Piano.
- She is beautiful.
- To make fade all the Marquis de Sade
- To make blush
whores of the harbor
- To make her scream with all the clutter
Silence.
...
- BRAVO!!!
- We killed it ! - Clearly!
- The evening ends well.
I hope you had a good time.
See you next year.
You will find children backstage. Goodbye!
Applause.
- Well, uh ... I have to go.
- It was beautiful, I am proud. 
- Paula!
- It was beautiful. - Thank you.
- You know we can attend the contest. - But ...
- The hearing is at 10 am tomorrow.
Good evening. Yes, good evening.
Your daughter has an exceptional voice.
But instead of helping, you are destroying her.
- He thanks you.
- Thank you.
The show was beautiful.
The costumes, the lights, it was impressive.
Congratulations.
Yes, congratulations. Same.
Goodbye.
...
- I need some air. I will turn it off.
Good night.
...
- I'm listening.
The song?
This is the story of a man and woman who love each other like never before.
There, now?
To make fade all the Marquis de Sade
To make blush whores of the harbor
To make her scream with all the clutter
To make shake the walls of Jericho
I will love you
To make burn hell in your eyes
To make swear all the thunders of God
To make rise your breasts and all the saints
To make you pray and implore our hands
I'll love you
I will love you like nobody ever loved you
I'll love you more beyond your dreams could imagine
I'll love you
I'll love you
I'm gonna love you like nobody dared to love you
I'll love you
How I would have loved to be loved
I'll love you
I'm going to
love you

Close your eyes. Fly away.
I will restart from the beginning.
Sorry.
When you want, princess.
- Dear parents, I'm leaving
I love you, but I'm leaving
You will not have children tonight
I do not run, I fly
Understand, I fly
Smoke-free, alcohol-free
I fly, I fly
She watched me yesterday
Anxious, confused, my mother as if she felt
In fact, she suspected
Heard
I said that I was Quite serene
She did not like
And my father, helpless
smiles
Do not turn around
Out a little more
There is a station, another station
And finally, the Atlantic
My dear parents, I'm leaving
I love you, but I'm leaving
You will not have children tonight
I do not run, I fly
Understand, I fly
Smoke-free, alcohol-free
I fly
I fly 
I wonder in my way
If my parents suspect
My tears flowed
My promises and the desire to move forward
Only believe in my life See what I promised myself
Why where and how in this train
That departs every moment
It's weird
this cage
Blocking my chest
I can not breathe
it prevents me
singing
My dear parents, I'm leaving
I love you, but I'm leaving
You have more children
tonight
I do not run, I fly
Understand, I fly
Smoke-free, alcohol-free
I fly
I fly
La, la, la, la,
la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la
la, la, la, la
I fly
I fly
- Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!! Bravo!!

We will call you back.

Very good choice.

- Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Good bye, sir. Thank you.
Goodbye. Thank you.

...

- Stop please.
...
- Go away.
