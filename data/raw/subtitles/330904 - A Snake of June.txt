We need a big camera!
We need a strong flash!
You need to be proud of your body,
keep that in mind.
So, a big camera and a big flash, uh?
I found a good restaurant,
we should go someday.
- See ya.
Mr Iguchi, why don't you work
on a new project instead?
- No.
Ok, you can go.
Are you sure you're gonna go
Mr Iguchi?
Well, anyhow, I hope I'll see you
tomorrow with your stuff.
Hello, this is your
heart-to-heart hotline!
Hello?
I'm just about to commit suicide.
[A SNAKE OF JUNE]
Once you found your passion,
you just have to go for it!
You don't have to worry about it.
Can I help you?
May I speak with Rinko Tatsumi?
May I ask who you are?
- I'd like to talk to her in person.
I am Tatsumi.
[heart-to-heart hotline]
Wow, so you saved their lives?
At first I thought she had a complaint
because of her attitude.
Oh, I thought so too actually.
I was a little harsh
with the child on the phone.
I was worried because he
hadn't called for a while.
Oh, thank God!
- You're ok.
I'm home.
- Oh, you scared me!
I didn't think you'd
be home this early.
Yeah.
- Have you had dinner yet?
I bought some only for myself.
Yes, I ate already.
I'll do that!
Was the sink that dirty?
Yes, I just enjoy doing it.
Honey, could we get a big dog?
- Hmmmm...
How about a small bunny rabbit?
Those things grow huge, you know.
Not that.
What's with you?
Ms Rinko?
- Oh boy, do you have
some bad news for me?
Let's put away the books
that you aren't reading.
Here you go.
- Hmm.
[Your husband's secrets]
What is it? Where is it from?
[Keep secret from your husband]
Thanks to you, I feel like I can
start over again.
I'm sorry I was rude to you
the first time we talked on the phone.
I've started something new in my life,
I'm sure you'll be proud.
Mr Shigehiko is away on business.
He couldn't make it today because of work,
but I'm sure he'll come visit soon.
Today, Mr Shigehiko was asking me
to buy a new car for him.
I told him that I had just bought him
one recently, then he seemed sad.
Good evening. Like you advised me,
it really does feel good
to take charge of my life.
Who do you think you are? You're
the guy who called me at the hotline!
Why don't you do what you want
with your life too?
Wear the skirt that you cut up
and go around town.
Wear the skirt that you cut up
and walk around town the way
you did in your apartment!
But your neighbors will see you
so take the skirt with you and change
where I'll tell you.
I'll tell you where to go. I will then
return the photographs and negatives.
Why should I trust someone like you?
It's not that I want sex from you,
I just am following my passion.
Stupid!
Let me do that!
I have more time than you!
I just got this sudden urge.
I'm sorry but I have to open this...
How about this Saturday?
Your husband has to work, right?
I'm gonna call the police!
Go ahead!
We'll go to hell together.
Why me? Why does it have
to be me?
You gave me the will
to live again.
When you called the hotline,
you swore you wouldn't
take pictures of people though.
I've never lied to you,
I've just changed.
Bye.
- See you later!
Let's begin!
First, hop on the train
and get off at the 5th stop.
You will find a bathroom.
Put the skirt on.
Are you done yet?
Are you done yet?
Please! Can we talk? I can meet you
at a cafe or something, please?
I can't do this!
- But you've been doing it
in your room all the time.
Not all the time!
You just caught me red-handed!
Why did you decide
to do such a thing?
Something is changing for you.
You can't do it because you believe
you can't! You don't have to worry
about what other people think.
I will then return the pictures.
You're not wearing underwear, correct?
Didn't I tell you to dress the same way
as if you were by yourself?
How about your shirt? Your hair?
Your make-up? It's not the same!
I left it home.
Oh well. Get out of the station
and head towards the department store.
... this shade would match
your skin perfectly...
Okay!
- I can't do this!
Ok, let's go buy you a dildo!
You want one, right?
Let's go buy it!
I don't want one!
- It's ok. And you'll get your pictures!
No! I can't do this!
It's what you always say.
Don't you have to follow
your passion?
Hmm? This one?
For me? Ok, one second.
Miss, I saw you wandering
in front of the store...
So you wanted one?
There's a window above you.
Let me see what you bought!
Wow, that's great!
Ok. This will be the end.
The pictures are...
No! Actually this is not the end...
This is exactly what I've always
wanted to do.
Put it inside yourself and leave
the remote outside the bathroom.
Give me the pictures back...
You gave me the will to live again.
But look at you, you can't even
follow your own heart.
You don't even understand your
husband. Can you really call
yourself a counselor?
He doesn't drink, he doesn't
snip around, unlike your father did.
You have yourself an ideal husband.
It's not like you're having sex
with someone else! It's one
of your secret desires.
It's nothing to be ashamed of!
Let's go shopping! At the grocery store,
pick up some bananas, cucumbers,
and eggplants. One of each.
I'm gonna kill you!
We usually don't sell by the piece.
But here you go, it's 500 yen.
Good job! Go back to the bathroom
and I'll return your pictures.
Is that you, honey?
Hello?
- Hello.
I thought that was over!
- I have something important to tell you.
I still have your pictures.
You said you gave them all back!
- If you want them back, listen to me.
You lied to me...
- No, I didn't! There was one photo
I forgot to give you!
Stupid!
- Fine. Don't listen to me.
Please go to the doctor.
Yes... Oh, good for you!
I'm proud of you!
No, no, don't worry... Take care,
I'll talk to you later.
"Healthcare at home"
[The last letter]
Yes?
- Delivery for you, Miss!
How did you know
about my condition?
How did you know?
It's... just... my instinct,
but I hoped I'd been wrong.
I'm in a similar situation now.
It's my cancer. I wanted to choose
how you'd die.
The pictures that I'd forgotten to give you,
I just couldn't turn them in.
I just can't stop gazing at them.
Oh, what the hell...
When you called the hotline,
you wanted to die.
You didn't tell me anything
about the disease.
So you had cancer, uh?
- I was afraid you'd dismiss me
if my condition was only physical.
You probably can't call me ever again.
Stop stalking me.
- I don't intend to cause trouble
ever again.
It was my last wish.
My body is still alive and I can't
end my life like this.
After that, I went home. My stomach
was aching so I rubbed it with my hand
which started aching too.
Do you think I sympathize?
- Oh God I know!
Stupid...
I'm going to die anyway... as a wife
who doesn't understand her husband.
A hardworking nerd who can't
express her emotions, someone
you look down on.
Now that you've decided how I'm
gonna die, stop vandalizing my life.
I hope you die lonely.
Hmm...
- Yeah?
Do you have a minute?
You have to have one breast removed?
- But that'll cure the cancer.
Why? Why does this have to happen?
I'm ok, don't worry.
How can you be so calm?
You're about to lose one breast!
But that'll save my life!
I'll do it, I'll do it!
- No, don't worry, I'll take care of it!
You know, I'm allergic to animals.
Why didn't you tell me you have a hamster?
Yes. Yes.
I understand.
Yes, it's my husband's mother.
I just got a call from the hospital.
Can I take today off?
I will call you. And also, about Sonoko.
She seems like a sensitive child.
Let her know that I left early.
Sorry I'm asking you to do this,
but I can't get off work.
Try and get home early today!
I know you were busy, but you could
have made it to the funeral.
Even the day she passed away,
you only showed up for a minute.
Do you have that much work to do?
At least you took care
of the funeral ceremony...
I was so nervous that you would
not show up today...
You were really.
This is a message for Rinko Tatsumi.
How did your surgery go today?
I'm home!
I'm home!
Welcome back.
- I didn't notice you were there.
Have you been to the doctor?
Are you ok?
- Yeah, I don't have to have breast removal.
- Really?
No more surgery!
- Good for you!
Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm fine.
You really like that cafe.
You were there the day
your mother passed away. Your mother
and wife must have felt lonely.
What are you talking about?
- So, you drink the powder form.
I myself take the tablets.
The shit-odor control medicine... You don't
like the smell of your own shit either?
I feel like I've known you for ages.
Is it you who did it?
- What?
Don't play dumb! The pictures!
- So, you saw them?
You saw them!
- How did the water taste after your bath?
Yes... Yes... Yes that's right.
I'd like to hire a PI for my wife.
[The number you dialed is
temporarily not in service]
I was never going to call you again.
I wanted to hear your voice
one last time.
Hey... Could you do me a favor?
Excuse me?
What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
Yeah, right!
That lady called saying that someone
was spying on her.
I don't know that girl.
- Then what are you doing out here,
don't play dumb!
You were watching her, uh?
Stop! Where do you think
you're going?
Stupid, you haven't had
your breast removed yet!
Good evening.
Did you do more
than take pictures?
Does Rinko go to that spot often?
I don't know.
- Give me the pictures!
That was the first time
I saw her there.
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
I really feel like I've known you
for a long time.
All I'm asking is the pictures!
Do you see the paper bag
in front of you?
Is this all you've got?
I've seen all the photos
you sent her!
What I want to see
is her true self!
You saw them too?
So you've seen everything.
Take off your clothes!
Get down on your knees!
Little Shigehiko... Little Shigehiko...
Was is your idea to forego
the breast removal?
Why do you know that?
You stupid!
She's gonna die.
Oh... Good for you. She's keeping
her breast for your pleasure.
She's going to die
with a beautiful body.
Much much better
than with an ugly one!
Those pictures... She asked me to take
them... So that you could have them.
Why? Why would Rinko do that?
The reason why a lot of nuns
have breast cancer is because
they don't get enough sex.
I have a question for you:
Is Rinko Tatsumi a nun?
Is Rinko Tatsumi a nun?
Why can't you do something
about her illness?
Die, motherfucker!
You don't want to see
Rinko die, do you?
I'll keep her company
at her deathbed.
From now on, that apartment is
mine. I'm going to live with Rinko!
You lazy bastard!
It smells good, the meat-stuffed
bellpepper smells good!
Husband's favorite!
And that goes in the miso soup.
Looks good...
I found an old camera when I
was going through my closet.
One that I'd used as a kid. I wish I
could have taken your photos with it.
It's about time I come.
- Alright.
Don't worry I'm coming too.
Is this Hell?
Yes, it is.
Ok, I have to go now.
I'll catch up with you soon.
Open up! Open the door! Open up!
