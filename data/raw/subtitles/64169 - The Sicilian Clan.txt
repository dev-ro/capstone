When I'm talking about 
horsethiefs, I don't say,
that it's bad to steal horses.
I leave the decision to the jury.
THE SICILIAN CLAN
Hands out of the pockets!
Look at me!
Tell me your names!
May I smoke?
Please.
Roger Sartet?
Can I take a piss?
Sit down.
There is a problem.
Your lawyer couldn't come.
If you want to postpone...
No. It's alright.
So, Sartet,
the investigation is over.
According to the law I have to 
read out your file,
before I hand you over 
to the accusation.
Here is a copy.
Your name is Roger Sartet.
Born on 15th October 1935,
Rue des Cordonniers 27, in Nancy.
You were raised with 
your sister, Monique,
at your father's, who was
working for a spinning company.
Until you became 11 years old you 
were visiting the school regularly.
Your teacher, Mr SÃ©gur,
said about you:
"He was always smiling and 
appeared friendly."
That's the only positive thing
I read about in your profile.
With 14 you got your 
first police record.
Come in!
Mr. Commissary!
Just one moment. I'm finished soon.
After a long series of 
coldblooded robberies
let's come to the raid on 
the jewelry store "Caron".
On 15th of June just before the 
closing time you enter the store.
You shoot without a warning.
You snatch jewelry worth 65 
millions Francs and escape.
Three months later the police 
knocks at your door.
You don't surrender and 
shoot at the officers.
Thereby you kill the two policemen 
Pontier and Saurel.
You always denied this robbery,
although it stands firm, that the 
bullets are shot from the same weapon,
that you've used to shoot the officers.
Those are the actual elements of crime.
I ask you the usual question:
- Do you want to add something?
- No.
Great.
"Confirms his testimony."
Sign, please.
Do you look at my throat?
In fact I don't.
You'll have to get up early 
to watch my execution.
Don't worry.
I'll be there.
- The Perez file.
- Ah! This one is still existing!
Thank you, but I quit smoking 13 days ago.
13 days and 6 hours to be exact.
Don't you miss it?
As you can see!
It doesn't really replace it, but it helps.
Drive!
Come on, can't you drive up a bit!
What are you waiting for?
Your brother is free.
Good.
Wait!
When will he contact me?
Under these circumstances,
no news is good news.
- A modern tool.
- Like a tin!
I am sorry!
You're sorry?
Last time he cost us two men.
And next time
it could be me.
It might be not of your concern!
But it will be!
I will demand your dismissal!
Get lost!
He's trying to give up smoking.
Now I understand.
He should continue smoking.
Vittorio Manalese & Sons
Electric Games
Thank you.
Why did you ask us?
I know Aldo and I know,
that he's reliable.
Here.
- They must be worth hundred!
- We will know in a bit.
That's not a bad idea,
to hide money.
And?
It's a little bit more than you thought.
We will get about...
145 millions Lira.
When will the business be done?
The client gets the money in a few days.
What do I do with the money?
- Do you still buy in Sicilia?
- Yes.
I purchased an option for a plot of land.
It's adjoining my property.
Altogether I will have 5000 hectars.
- Do you want to settle down there?
- I do.
You're going to bore yourself to death.
I was nine when I left Sicilia.
They will all bow in front 
the former beggar.
That will be splendid!
And my parents have
a nice grave there.
You are all the same!
Tony Nicosia buried his father 
in a platin coffin.
The living need the money!
- Who do you belong to?
- I'm Aldo's wife.
Aldo and me, we live here.
We will stay with my father-in-law,
as long as you stay here.
The fridge is full.
Here is the bathroom.
I'll give you fresh sheets.
This is Turi Locascio, my best friend.
My family: Aldo, my oldest.
Very glad to meet you.
Sergio, my youngest.
My daughter Theresa
and her husband Luigi.
Hallo, Grandpa!
My grandson.
Maria, my wife. You already met.
- How are you?
- Thank you, I'm fine.
Pleasure to meet you.
Jeanne, the wife of Aldo.
She's french.
Bon jour.
Please, take a seat at the table!
- So, how are you?
- I'm fine.
Roberto!
All right.
The cheese.
Aldo!
Tell her to wear longer skirts.
A beer, please.
Do I have to take the day off?
Not if you're a reasonable person.
- Ok, then I'll take the day off.
- Why?
Do you have a bad conscience 
because of that?
Do you think I'm stupid?
It's about my brother.
I read the papers.
That's all I know.
Do you see? I can't help you.
I haven't asked for anything.
What do you want then?
To tell you this:
Do you see this phone?
And the other one over there?
And remember the one at your home?
All of them are being surveillanced.
You are under permanent observation.
Whatever you try,
somebody will always be around.
You're wasting your time.
He won't call.
Possibly.
But if he will, you say:
"Monique Sartet isn't around."
"She doesn't work here anymore."
If you should say anything else,
I won't be able to help you.
And that would make me feel sorry.
Usually they start the surveillance 
without a warning.
Not this time.
I am warning you...
to spare you the worst.
Well, now all we can do is to wait.
Will he try to call her?
Yes.
And because he cannot 
talk, he'll come personally.
At least that's what I hope.
And if you're not able 
to catch him then...
Monique Sartet, please!
When does she start working?
But she still works for you?
Hello?
Hello.
Here are some supplies.
Thank you.
What you have done right now,
wasn't very clever.
Those people downstairs would 
get angry because of this.
Then go and tell them!
- You wouldn't do it anyway.
- And why not?
Because of this!
I've got everything I need already.
Why do I come here then?
Out of curiosity
to see a murderer face to face.
No one shoots around here!
It might be smarter not to shoot.
And more difficult to do so!
Sounds like a self-contended 
family you are from.
I'm not the only one whose 
roots aren't sicilian.
How is it, when you shoot?
So you are interested in this!
I'll tell you a secret:
It goes "boom"!
And when he falls in front of you,
what do you feel?
Nothing.
It's all going so fast.
The first time, I shot
because people didn't recognize me.
I must have looked pretty unconvincing.
That simple...
You should go, or I'll forget myself.
- Where is he?
- Room 36.
Is it him?
I'm sure it is.
He walked straight to the elevator.
Do you know this girl?
Simone, a regular.
Call them.
Do it!
Ask, if they want something to drink.
Yes?
I don't know, let me ask.
Would you like something to drink?
Champagne.
Do you have champagne?
Bring us some.
Here, for the champagne.
And this is for you.
If all clients were like you!
Enjoy it. It's the first time
I am paying for this.
Are you angry about the champagne thing?
No, it's ok.
That's happening for the first time, 
that M. Albert urging to consume.
What's happening?
Jean-Marie Ballard.
Antoine Lecarpe.
Giorgio Bennini.
Nicolas Ramsky.
That's all?
Yes, Mr. commissary.
There were five people in this cell.
Let's begin.
Name, profession?
Jean-Marie Ballard,
electrical engineer.
Detained for..?
- For three months.
- Reason?
What happened?
I was in Rome, to install a 
security system at a jewelry exhibition.
This jewelry is worth billions.
The job was going on for a month.
but then, the schedule got 
shorter than planned.
I went home and
wanted to surprise my wife.
I surprised her...
She was laying in bed with somebody.
I lost my nerves.
I had a weapon...
and I shot.
You were with Sartet in the same cell.
How was your relationship... good?
Yes. He was the nicest of all.
Furthermore, he was well behaved.
Here.
This is the security device installed
in Villa Borghese in Rome,
drawn by its creator.
He wasn't very good at drawing.
He couldn't do better while he 
was crawling on the floor.
It's strange, that he told 
you all that.
A thing of temper.
He was in jail for the first time.
A jealousy drama.
He opened himself up to the first 
person who was nice to him.
I didn't even need to squeeze him out.
He told more and more day after day.
I think,
this is the coup of the century.
But we don't want to kill anybody.
You never know before.
But we want to know it before.
If you don't want to take the risk you 
should go and play bowling instead.
Have you spoken to me?
Sergio!
I think this engineer is trustworthy.
But not you!
- Not me?
- Not you!
You're always thinking about one thing.
Because of you we almost 
ended in jail tonight.
Should I have done it here?
At 35 it's a normal behaviour.
I'm really considering to keep 
my hands off this whole story.
I respect this.
There are other people.
Then leave.
But whom will you sell the jewelry to?
There is no problem to sell it 
for half-price to somebody.
Oh, really?
Do you know people, who 
might spend five billions?
Do you know any?
And you? Do you?
Yes. I know somebody.
What do you suggest?
You don't worry about anything
and stay here.
You are too incautious.
All right.
But don't play tricks!
That's my idea.
Hello, mademoiselle? Please, 
connect me to New York.
Tony Nicosia.
New York, 957 - 5000.
Vittorio, haven't you got enough land?
You always want to buy more.
I'll hide him for the last time, 
then it'll be over!
After this I'll return to my homeland.
Are you in a hurry to die?
Hello, Tony?
It's me, Vittorio.
I hope I didn't wake you up.
Three o'clock in the morning? You always 
have to do things differently.
No. It has nothing to do with business.
I am offering you a vacation.
How about a little trip to Rome?
Not that soon. In two or three days.
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
It's been 37 years!
Contact me when you arrive in Rome.
I'll pick you up at the airport then.
I still look the same.
I thought you haven't changed much!
As you can see!
Oh my god!
- Speak french!
- You're right.
In the carpet, an alarm system.
There, in the board
is another one.
Microphones.
Shock detectors.
Everything exactly as it 
was on the picture.
Yes, everything similar to the picture.
Only this isn't.
Look.
- What is it?
- You'll know soon.
When they turn the alarm on,
it'll be activated immediately.
Because of your clock?
Do you think I'd sacrifice 
my clock for nothing?
I've never seen anything like this before.
- American?
- Yes.
How does it work?
Through waves.
One tick-tack on my clock...
Every move interferes with the waves 
and activates the alarm.
The direct connection to the 
police wasn't planned either.
Let's forget about this.
It was nice to see you again.
Hands up!
You have to hold it this 
way, not like this!
Got it?
How old is your nephew?
Almost seven. And yours?
Nine years and six months.
As you can see,
we didn't come for nothing.
Tell me, Tony,
in two weeks the jewelry will 
be brought to New York.
There is already talking about it.
For the road from Villa Borghese
to the airport
they will probably use the military forces.
Certainly. It's worth 25 billions.
You can't do anything during 
this part of the journey.
And in Paris it won't be different.
Just different uniforms.
And in New York there will be 
ten times as many.
And the security system is 
the same as it is in Rome.
Ten times....
Have you found something?
I take the plane and batteries.
And I'd like
to have this.
- Do you want me to wrap it up?
- Yes, please.
Listen, I've got an idea:
the plane lands somewhere else.
- You want to hijack it?
- Why not?
If you're led by political motives 
it could be done.
It would work out.
You'd get rewarded.
But we will be expected by the 
police as soon as we land.
You can imagine the picture!
We've got to think about it,
everybody for himself.
If I have an idea,
I'll send you somebody
with the other half.
You do it the same way.
Or we'll meet again in 40 years.
Hopefully unchanged!
You wish, Sir?
Mr. Manalese?
Yes.
Kids! Tony has got an idea of a genius.
Be right back.
Luigi! Tell Teresa, she should 
rent an insular villa
near the italian border.
Can I have somethng to drink?
What would you like?
Scotch, Vodka, Gin...
whatever you have.
Thierry!
I need five fake passports.
For whom?
For Aldo, Sergio, Luigi, 
Jeanne and for me.
When will they be ready?
In one week.
- For which names?
- Simple names. Wait...
Charles Bosquet.
Suzanne Haussmann.
RenÃ© Pereire.
AndrÃ© Spontini.
Robert Levallois.
That'd be it.
You can't do this!
Are you crazy? Stop it!
I will complain about your actions 
by the commissary!
Now, I'm listening.
What should I say?
I don't understand.
You wanted to complain.
Proceed. I'm all ear.
They've put my whole room into chaos.
and haven't found anything.
They're not allowed to do this!
That's all?
That's all.
I want a lawyer.
I will catch a cold.
I'm very sensitive.
We'll forget about the stuff...
if you're reasonable
and going to help us.
Does it sound familiar?
Pascal Lastaldi?
I don't know him, honestly!
And the photo?
Doesn't ring a bell.
Do you still have the other pack?
Isn't it Sartet on the photo?
Bravo!
When he's got arrested, he 
had this passport.
Rovel! Where does it come from?
Not bad.
Good work. But one can do better...
I don't want an evaluation.
I want an address.
I can't do that.
I can't!
Aha! A question of conscience.
That's right! I don't 
give away addresses.
I'm different from you.
I tell you an address:
Police headquarters!
Bring him away!
Mr. commissary!
I don't remember the name anymore.
But I still know the way.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Raymond.
- It's Raymond.
- Let him in.
Malik, is it you?
And you are?
We'll discuss it later.
Bring the others away and 
send Rovel home!
Is that your work?
I don't shoot passport photos.
As you can see, I do art photography.
Listen carefully, Malik.
I'm willing to forget, that you're 
making "art" photography.
Sartet needs passports.
You're producing them, so he needs you.
Have you seen him?
That's all in the past.
Otherwise I wouldn't need to do porn.
This is the proof after all.
Bring him away!
Forget the search warrant!
Well, well!
Look at this.
Well, hello!
We were succesful.
Levallois, Robert.
Pereire, RenÃ©.
Bosquet, Charles.
Spontini, AndrÃ©.
Haussmann, Suzanne.
Which one is for Sartet?
None of them.
Sartet - this means problems.
Nobody would risk anything 
for him anymore.
Give me the photos.
Photos, Malik!
Or we'll have to search your home.
You better give them to me right now.
Over there.
I swear.
Here are the negatives.
Sartet is not on any of them.
I can develop them immediately.
Shit! Now everything is lost!
You shouldn't have done this.
Put him away!
Try to develop the film anyway.
Mr. commissary, could you come over.
Must be some close friends.
Four names.
You pay a visit to the first two.
I take the others starting 
with this "Leoni".
We'll leave as soon as we get
our papers. And Sartet.
We're leaving right now.
- Who's driving?
- Jeanne.
Tell her to drive slowly.
- Boss!
- What?
It's about Malik.
I've told them
he doesn't have your number.
So does he?
He doesn't.
- So?
- But he's got mine.
And it's easy to find out
where I work.
But don't worry - Malik won't speak.
Don't worry.
Most likely the police will come 
here sooner or later anyway.
I'll let him know.
Make no stops on your way. The villa 
is located close to Menton.
You wanted to speak to me?
- Are you Mr. Manalese?
- Yes.
- Commissary Le Goff.
- Pleased to meet you!
I want to interview one of your employees.
I'll call him. What is his name?
Leoni.
I've fired Leoni.
Wait. That must have
happened two, three months ago.
Why have you fired him?
It had nothing to do with the job.
This was more delicate.
Why so?
I don't have any proof,
but one day he had this strange phone call.
Something about passports 
and driver's licenses.
He must have done illegal things
to earn some extra money.
Fake documents?
I don't know. I preferred to fire him.
You should have called the police.
I didn't have any proof.
And he was a sicilian, like me.
I wanted to give him a chance.
You know, that's family business.
Soon I'll go back to Sicilia.
I don't want to attract attention.
Do you know these passports?
Bosquet.
Pereire.
Levallois.
Sounds like a map of Paris.
No, I don't know them.
What about those photos?
Is that a joke?
Yes, a bad joke.
One light goes on too early
and everything is ruined.
Forget it!
Well, see you not too soon, hopefully.
No problem, Mr. commissary.
Come over for a visit, whenever you want.
- You wish?
- Juice.
- Orange juice or...
- Whatever.
Thank you.
Somebody is waiting for you outside.
First corner for France!
Charly Loubet will shoot.
Smile.
Don't look at me!
Listen well, Monique.
I'm going to leave.
I leave Europe forever.
I got you into enough trouble.
There is no reason to cry.
Or do you miss the visits in jail?
Take over.
- How's the score
- Two to one.
- And downstairs?
- She's talking with a friend.
As soon as I arrive there,
I'll send you money.
Aldo will help to transfer it to you.
Also...
That's all.
I just wanted to say good bye.
Bye, little sister!
You seem to be a very violent person.
That's nothing.
Your mother must not know anything.
Why?
She doesn't want me to go swimming.
You promise? Nobody must know anything.
Listen...
You should stop drinking from 
now on, understood?
I've got it under control.
I hope so.
Good evening, Sartet.
Well, it's going to happen in two days.
Altogether there are eight men:
Four dealers, three in the escort
and the man from the insurance company.
He'll arrive tomorrow.
He's got a room at the "Minerva" hotel.
His name is Edward J. Evans.
Here are your passports.
You can go on board.
Mr. Packard?
Mr. Valac?
Mr. Goldenstein?
Mr. van Peters?
Mr. Evans?
Mr. Maxwell?
Mr. Feccio?
Mr. Stern?

My husband flies from Rome.
We wanted to meet each other here.
Evans? One moment, please.
Mr. Evans, please contact Mrs. Evans.
My husband is on a special delegation.
I understand.
Your husband stayed on board.
You can go to him.
My husband gave this trip to 
New York to me as a present.
- He sits in front.
- Thank you very much.
This has to be a misunderstanding.
- I just was there...
- Excuse me.
Yes.
For you.
Hello?
Yes, I speak french. Who are you?
I'm from the security service 
of the french police.
I've got a message for you.
Your husband stayed in Rome.
He'll come tomorrow.
Same flight, same time.
The seat is already booked.
This is all very confidential.
The real jewelry will arrive tomorrow.
An additional measure of security.
Thanks a lot. I'm flying tomorrow.
I have to collect my luggage.
Thanks a lot.
Attention please!

flight 404 to New York!
I want to call Rome, the "Minerva" hotel.

Hello? Thanks. 
Teheran, Number 5.
Rome, Number 7.
Hello? Hotel "Minerva"?
I'd like to speak to Mr. Evans.
E-V-A-N-S.
Bourdier! How are you?
Good.
Still nonsmoker?
I still am, Mr.!
- The food is tasty.
- I've eaten in Orly.
So the jewelry is on the way?
In four hours it'll arrive in New York.
And what about Sartet?
Not that well. I'm still 
tapping in the dark.
- See you later.
- Ciao.
- No, thank you.
- I'd like some champagne.
My luggage is lost! My husband 
is not in Rome anymore!
There is no reservation for 
tomorrow for "Evans".
You've told me on the phone,
that I will fly tomorrow.
I want to know, what happened
to my husband!
Calm down.
It wasn't me, who called you.
Besides we know, that there is 
a Mr. Evans on this flight.
But it wasn't my husband.
I was inside the plane!
Don't move! Put those on!
Don't move!
I won't do anything, what might 
endanger my passengers.
You'll do, what we're telling you to do.
You leave!
Stay in your seat!
You're getting exchanged.
Go!
Same, please.
No.
It was this one!
With a pair of sun glasses.
Look carefully - are you sure?
This was the one!
- Is he at his office?
- Yes.
Le Goff!
What's up?
Sartet is on the plane which transports 
the jewelry to New York.
New York, please.
Hallo? New York, please.
Give me a light.
What are you planning to do?
Is it political or because of the jewelry?
As you can see, the police is expecting you.
And you can't shoot up here either.
Ask him!
We don't have anything to lose.
So follow our instructions.
I see you for the first time!
Oh my God! Nobody notices me.
Well...
What are you doing afterwards?
Can't tell yet.
You should better go back to your seat.
Hello?
Hello, Le Goff?
I'm leaving the control room.
We've got contact with the plane.
It will land in a few minutes.
You are crazy!
Keep calm,
or I'll shoot.
In a few moments we'll 
land in New York.
Please stop smoking and put your 
seatbacks into normal position.
Thank you.
Where do you want to land?
Don't move! Stay in your seat!
Get up!
Calm down!
- Everything's fine?
- Everything's fine.
You fly to Paris in 45 minutes.
You fly to Rome in an hour.
You fly to Veracruz in a few days.
Montreal, 5.15.
Hello?
Wait. It's Wilson.
Hello? Yes, it's me.
I'm listening.
Thank you, Wilson.
It's barely mentioned.
Only a few lines.
Nothing new about the "air pirates".
The police seems helpless.
Are the gangsters hiding 
in outer space?
Say "good night".
They do it like Jeanne and Mr. Sartet!
He's crazy!
What are you talking about?
You don't believe him, do you?
It is true!
Be quiet, Roberto!
You shouldn't lie!
She told me not to tell anything.
That's enough! Go to bed.
They were at the beach,
behind a rock.
Exactly like those two on tv.
Nonsense!
Silence!
Send her out!
That's not true!
Get lost!
You never liked me!
That's why you believe him.
Bring him to bed!
Luigi!
Call Tony Nicosia in New York.
This is family business.
What are you going to do?
I'll get your friend Sartet here.
- Who is it?
- Tony.
Here is your passport,
a driver's license
and a shipticket.
You leave tomorrow.
In six days you'll arrive in Veracruz.
Is it nice there?
If you've got 500 millions
in your pocket,
it's nice everywhere.
And the money?
The money? Which money?
My share.
Vittorio has it.
What?
He's got my money?
He wanted to have it. That was 
the arrangement, wasn't it?
We arranged just one thing -
that I'll get my money.
It seemed logical to me as well.
Those bastards!
I haven't said anything, because 
it's none of my business.
But it seemed kind of...
strange to me.
Can you help me?
How should I help you?
One ticket to Paris.
Alright.
Take this!
Your plane is going one day after tomorrow.
Good afternoon or better, good evening,
because it's already late here.
Yes.
Arrival tomorrow at 14:00 in Orly?
14:00 Paris time?
Ok.
Do you think he got suspicious somehow?
He should come over and get his share.
Thank you, Tony. Ciao.
He's landing at 14:00 in Orly.
You'll get him.
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Ok. Let's finish it.
Hello?
Who are you?
Your brother lands tomorrow 
at 14:00 in Orly. Tell him...
Don't hang up!
Hello? Who are you?
Your brother lands tomorrow 
at 14.00 in Orly.
Tell him...
She hanged up quickly.
She won't go there.
She must go there.
That would make it more difficult.
She's got to go to Orly.
She got a call, so she can go there.
I just want to know, who did 
it and for what reason...
And when her brother recognizes her,
he won't have the guts to shoot.
That's what I hope, at least.
United Overseas Airlines Flight 408
from New York landed in Paris Orly.
Don't get nervous!
Picking up your brother?
Do you know them, boss?
Only the sister.
Let's interrupt this...
Aldo!
Sartet. Yes, Roger Sartet.
You expected me for 14:00, but
I came earlier today.
You can't be careful enough.
I'll tell you what I see right now.
Aldo, Sergio and Luigi
are getting arrested.
And so is my sister.
If she gets imprisoned, I'm 
going to kill all of you.
And now I want my share!
Your money is here.
You can have it, where and 
whenever you want.
With your millions you'll be able 
to buy yourself many nice suits!
Hopefully all of your children 
will perish in prison!
I hope he'll kill you!
Do you have my money?
Watch out!
Good evening, Mr. Manalese.
Are you surprised to see me?
As I said, you can come over 
whenever you want.
Looks like you were pretty lucky today.
If you say it...
So, can we go?
Let's go!
Grandpa?
You don't stay for dinner tonight?
No, not today.
