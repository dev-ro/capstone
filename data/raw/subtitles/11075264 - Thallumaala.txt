I am not sure if this is the last fight.
Every end has to have a beginning, right?
Honestly, I can't recall
where it all started.
Let me give it a try.
SIX MONTHS AGO
Enough. Move now.
-All the friends can join in.
-Come on.
Come.
Okay, ready.
They are my friends.
They aren't ordinary guys.
I found them while fighting.
CHAPTER ONE - UN"BEAT"ABLE FRIENDSHIP
Haven't you seen it on
TV and in the newspaper?
The earth is burning.
It's scorching hot.
This condition is called global warming.
Likewise, if you read the newspaper,
you will know that
as the earth gets hot,
the people of the planet
also turn into hotheads.
Give me my cap!
We will have to call it,
"global freaking out."
No one is willing to compromise.
So now you see,
a war has begun and
this won't be news anymore.
Instead the act of helping
each other will become news.
We are awaiting that time.
We will have to follow the
path of virtue to counter evil.
This is said by Allah in the Quran.
Haven't you heard that?
Good and evil cannot be equal.
Repel evil with what is better.
And you will see
the one you had enmity with
is behaving as if he was a devoted friend.
But it will not be possible
except for those who are patient.
It is not possible except
for the very fortunate ones.
Hey!
What is it? Did you like me?
Yes, I do!
I'll treat you with pancake and beef curry
after the prayers!
Wow!
Don't limit it to just food.
Get me married to your sister.
Who is the champion?
Who is the champion?
Not the one who wrestles down
his opponent in a match,
but the one who restrains his anger
is the real champion.
The day, on which
Adam and Eve got together
As per the prophecy
Of the master of the world
Two fellows quarreled
On that felicitous day
Let us sing this ballad by
Stringing the beat Loop!
I'm my mother's only son.
Are you trying to kill me?!
One came decked up for the festival
And the other made him bite the dust
The kinder one in the gang
With a broad smile
Who wouldn't beat up his mom
For no reason
The one with ears sealed
And mouth forever released
The one who batters the opponent
And slips through the net
Then, another one, a sweet one
With the face of a flatbread
One who gets all the beatings
Without giving any!
-Get up!
-Get up!
Oh, my God!
Don't you know it's a mosque?
He stared at me!
After that?
After that…
Why are you grilling me?
Ask him as well.
He asked if I would
marry my sister to him.
So what?
I don't want his sister.
But I have no sister!
Awesome!
Anyway, you don't come to the mosque
in this condition.
Go to the hospital.
Do you have a vehicle?
I've got a bike.
What about you?
-I don't have any.
-Then you take him along.
And you all go to the mosque.
Was there a cap here?
To heck with you.
Pull it.
Where do you want to go?
Drop me at home. I'll direct you.
Okay, lead me.
Damn these roosters!
-Hey, what happened?
-Just got acquainted with him!
Hey, you boy!
Had a minor tiff while talking.
He said he was going to the mosque
and went for a tiff?
What is for lunch, Mom?
There is ghee rice and chicken curry.
-Isn't there lentil curry?
-Yeah, that's there as well.
Then serve it. I'm hungry.
Won't you invite your friend?
Come inside, dear.
Have lunch and go.
No, thanks. I've some other work to do.
Go inside, eat and go.
Picking up a fight for no reason!
Wear this.
I sometimes go casting fishing nets
with my father.
See this!
You're an expert in this strike.
It was quite good.
What's your name?
Wazim.
No, I want to know the
name of that elbow strike.
By the way, I'm Jamshi.
There's a local sevens' match
in the evening. You want to join?
I'm in.
Sathar, are you in?
No, man. I got to go to see my girlfriend.
What's going on here?
I'll show you something!
I was successful doing it before.
You need to practice it daily.
Let me show you.
See…
Wazi…
-What?
-It's a hell of a fight!
-A gang fight?
-It's a fight between two people.
Those who try to stop them
are getting beaten up.
-Then, let's go through Pallippadi.
-Why should we take another route?
It says, God will reward you if you remove
the obstacle on the road.
Yeah, there's a saying of that sort!
-What is his intention?
-I think it's a paid service.
What's going on here?
Move away!
Oh, God!
The ones who fight like dogs
In broad daylight
Right in the middle of the road
Yet, loyal ones, purehearted ones
The ones who caress others
Ones as pure as a pearl!
Yet, loyal ones
The purehearted ones
What are you filming?
Stop it!
Let go of him!
Let go!
I said stop!
Go home!
Five Malabar pancakes
and beef curry, please!
Oh honey, I've four bucks
To buy pancakes and beef curry
There is a craving in my heart
To eat some
Oh, blushing bride
The groom of your alluring dreams
Here he comes!
Oh, girl! Here he comes!
Wazim, now it's set!
These guys are a bit different.
By different, I mean that…
Don't grill me asking
over and over again! Give me time!
Hey!
I have no doubt.
You look cool. Go ahead with this!
Don't do that now!
It's not time yet!
Wait a bit more!
Hey…
I got beaten up while buying clothes.
Who beat you up? For what?
I went to buy the shirt,
and I saw them molesting a girl.
I went to confront them,
and one of them kicked me.
Why are you always asking for it?
I didn't beg for it.
Those guys are wayward.
Moreover, should I keep mum
watching them molest a girl?
Reji, in that case,
we must address it.
Of course! We must, for sure.
After all, this is our town.
How dare they!
We must go now itself.
They are in that shopping mall.
Reji…
Shall we go, check and come?
No outsiders shall show off that much!
Let's go check it out once, Reji!
Okay, then let's go.
Hey!
Smiling like a jasmine
The voice is melodious like a koel
Oh blushing bride
The groom of your is alluring dreams
Here he comes!
Oh girl! Here he comes!
Shafi, send the people
in the auditorium quickly.
-I am upset.
-What for?
There's no beef on the menu.
Really?
What a letdown!
Isn't beef the real meat?
Nothing can beat chicken!
Beef is the real meat.
Look at the other meats.
Goat meat, chicken meat, rabbit meat,
deer meat…
You need to call it all by its names.
But for beef, just meat would be enough!
You have plenty of such ideas!
Come, let's have a deep conversation.
What is actually beef?
All beef is not actually beef.
Not the flesh of a cow, bull, or ox!
But buffalo meat!
A fine, tender, first-rate buffalo meat!
That too, the undercut meat!
That's the real beef!
With love gushed within the soul
Siyad, should we do it now?
Can we postpone it to the end?
But wasn't this your idea?
I had only you in the scene, not me.
Loser! Who are you scared of?
Today is his wedding day.
He won't dare to come
up with his devilry.
Weaving fantasies in her eyes
With a blooming soul
Decked up in drapes
The bride awaits, blushing
In the fragrant nuptial room
Wazim…
This dude makes
cameo appearances in my life!
I don't know why.
What's wrong with you?
To heck with you!
I won't spare you!
Now playing "Want to spray foam on me?!"
"Will spray it to your ass, you dog!"
Want to spray foam on me?!
Will spray it to your ass, you dog
Manavalan Wazim on the floor.
Want to spray foam on me?!
Foam! Foam!
Want to spray foam on me?!
HELL BROKE LOOSE AMIDST
VLOGGER BEEPATHU'S WEDDING.
THE FIGHT BROKE OUT DURING
A MARRIAGE AT PONNANI.
SI REJI GETS BEATEN UP.
Manavalan Wazim!
Manavalan--
WHERE ARE YOU, WAZI?
MANAVALAN MILKSHAKES
0% FOAM, 100% SHAKE
WANT TO SPRAY FOAM ON ME?
WILL SPRAY IT TO YOUR ASS, YOU DOG!
CHAPTER TWO - BREAK A LEG
So, it's fixed!
The chief guest will be "Manavalan Wazim"!
Bro, but no one knows where he is!
He has vanished from the face
of the internet!
We will track him down…
and bring him here!
Enough!
Nihal.
Nihal.
Isn't that my phone ringing?
It's somewhere from upstairs.
I'll check and bring it.
Pick up the call fast.
It must be him.
Give it to me.
It was Wazim,
but the call got disconnected.
-Oh God!
-Hey, Nihal!
How many times have I told you
not to leave the phone here and there.
My time-lapse video!
-Maybe he'll call me now.
-Let me check that phone.
Such wayward kids!
-Hey, watch out!
-Your uncle's call got disconnected!
-What can I do about that?!
-He'll call again if he needs to.
It's just a phone call, after all!
What about my need?
Won't I need to know his whereabouts?
He is not a baby now.
He'll take care of himself.
Hey.
Tie the small one on the other side.
-Here.
-What's this?
Sugar balls.
That's his favorite.
This will be slaughtered tomorrow.
Don't say it out loud.
Poor thing! He'll feel bad.
Bug off!
Are you going?
Jamshi.
Why are you calling me repeatedly
in spite of me disconnecting the call?
-Bug off, bloody loser!
-Hello.
Rajesh.
I've a customer with me now.
Will come there.
-Okay?
-Alright.
-Tell me, Vikas.
-Sathar, did you see?
No, show me.
Then see it.
Sathar, what is in his mind?
We will have to ask him.
I have no clue.
Jamshi… what's in your mind?
What do you mean?
Why should we mind someone
who doesn't mind us?
He's down and out!
Can't we let him grow?
It's his comeback, after all!
Let's watch it once.
We must recognize that
social media abounds
in the new pitfalls of consumer culture.
Bro.
Will you join us for a photo?
-Our photo?!
-Alright.
I mean, can we include him as well?
Who?
Yeah!
-Yes! Got it!
-Show it to me.
-In the name of celebration of democracy,
-Thankless fellow!
the cultural trends and fashion
assimilated by the youth here,
are strengthening the
neo-liberal economic system…
Chill, Wazim.
There should be no going back
from this comeback!
There's no going back
from this comeback.
Let's go!
WELCOME MANAVALAN WAZIM
That moron is ignoring us.
Maybe he just looked at us,
but didn't see us.
Opportunities in your struggle.
You have to find the light.
You have to find a way to make it better
even in the worst situation
you have ever been.
It's high time to reform
this brainwashed generation!
MANAVALAN WAZIM
Wazi, recognized me?
I'm Althaf, your boss's nephew.
Nobody is paying attention to us.
Can you hear me?
Can you please remove
that device from your ears?
Can you hear me now?
I want to ask something
to you out of curiosity.
What contribution
have you made to this society,
for which you are coming and sitting here?
In what name
do you welcome him here?
So, you have no clue!
Just for sheer pleasure!
This is what I have been
talking about for so long.
How painful it is that such petty people,
who celebrate the fame they gain
through obscenity,
share the stage
with great writers and artists!
Hence, I am saying…
Can you please give me that mic?
Hello.
Hi!
Do you have the same opinion?
No!
Are you upset or happy that I have come?
Happy!
According to you,
what do you think I am really good at?
Wazim is handsome!
Wazim's brawls!
Thank you.
How many people have…
What was your name?
Yeah! J.P Kodoor!
This guy's…
I mean how many of you
have read the story or poem or
whatsoever of this great personality?
We have never read them!
Now I feel that his book
has some useful stuff in it.
They are useless!
No, I am serious!
Those who are interested,
please read them.
My dear fans, please calm down!
So, I came,
saw you all and made you happy!
You're amazing!
Now let me go.
Keep the mic with you.
-Oh, no! Don't go! Wait!
-Bro, please.
-Please don't go, bro.
-Wazi.
Please, don't go, Wazim.
Wazim, please listen to us.
Don't go.
Hey, you! Go after the event!
Don't pinch me, you loser!
We want to see you fight!
We want to see you fight!
We want to see you fight!
We want to see you fight!
We want to see you fight!
-Make way!
-Move!
-Move away, friends.
-Don't push. Make way.
I said move away.
Fights are of many kinds.
Be it the football fights, street fights,
carnival fights, festival fights,
gala fights, or theater fights!
And, then there comes
the hit-or-miss fight!
And finally, fights to settle scores!
Such fights can be classified into three.
The one that hits the body,
the one that hits the ego,
and the one that hits the emotions.
The backlash for each
is different from the other.
Greetings!
This message is for the people
who didn't understand what he said.
All the people who have joined here today
are our dear and near ones.
But I apologize to everyone
that things turned out like this.
The wedding…
You all must have understood
that it won't happen now.
But we have prepared
a grand feast for everyone.
So, everyone, please eat well
before leaving.
And those who created havoc here…
can also eat and go.
He didn't ask me to say this.
I just suit myself.
Wazi.
This was your best fight
ever in your career!
Come close.
Let me kiss you.
Darn!
Fathima, show some respect.
Your mother would've said the same.
You have been given so many chances.
I'm sorry, Fatima.
Come back with us.
It's her.
Hello.
I'm going back.
Okay.
Life has become a cycle, Wazi.
So, if anyone has any
doubts, then you can ask me.
-Sir!
-Doubts!
Is the brawl seen in your video
original or duplicate?
It's not a duplicate…
but original!
Didn't you see the video?
Did you feel it was a duplicate?
Learn to use social media
and cyberspace wisely.
It's your responsibility to save this…
young generation from its perils!
Understood?
Okay then…
Jai Hind.
POLICE
Screw the social media!
Sir.
-Sir, the chain snatching case--
-You bloody chain snatcher!
Sir, he's the petitioner's--
-The petitioner?!
-Sir, he's the petitioner's husband!
-You get a complaint against me from him.
-Alright, sir.
THE SI WHO ASSAULTED THE COMPLAINANT
HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.
Hello, Mom.
I'm around here, Mom.
Give the phone to Wazim, Sathar.
We saw the video.
Is a video out?
Mom.
Are you not coming home, Wazim?
Yes, I will.
You don't need to come to this house.
Why?
You have got so many other places to go.
Then why would you need your home?
Hello, Dad…
Nowadays, we get to know of your arrival
through the media, and internet.
Dad, listen to me once.
Wazim, do you really
have anything valid to say?
If yes, then tell me.
There will be many places for you to go to
as Manavalan Wazim.
You may go there.
But you can enter this
house only as my son.
Haven't you exiled me
several times like this, Dad?
Then, why did you show up?
I will leave that house only if
you kick me out from there.
And unlike you said,
I have no other place to go.
I will come to my house to eat the
coconut rice prepared by my mother.
This is your son Wazim and
not the guy others refer to.
Where are you off to?
Where are you going?
Your son is coming to eat coconut rice.
I'll go and get an ash gourd.
Maybe that will help him think well.
Then buy some for you as well.
-Wazim!
-Wazim!
Please greet us!
-Yes!
-Yes!
-What's the plan?
-Arabian Grills.
Arabian Grills?
-That's cool, right?
-Not bad.
What will be our total expenses?
I can invest half of it.
Oh, come on! This means we are of no use.
Do you know how much is half?
He knows nothing!
You tell me the total amount,
then I'll tell you the half!
It is not yet time to plan the budget.
We need to take care
of other things first.
First, we need to go and see that spot.
We can't just hurry!
The location is ready.
I have a name for the shop.
Do you want to know?
-Yes.
-Yes. Tell me.
The name is B-U-R-N-O.
Burno!
Rejected.
Is New Wave rejected as well?
-That's a good name.
-It's cool.
Okay.
NEW WAVE
It's perfect.
-Wazi.
-Yes?
-Did you let go of that matter?
-I left it then itself!
What?!
What's the matter you intended?
The same you intended!
I left it!
Didn't I tell you?
My boy has changed a lot!
He won't stick on to that matter anymore!
I think it's that other thing!
She ditched the guy who had ditched her!
Didn't you tell him about it?
You dogs! Are you freaking kidding me!
Wazi…
This is her fiancé.
She's getting engaged in two days.
I just came to know.
CHAPTER THREE - GROOVY BEATS!
Wazi.
Where's your Dad?
He went to Chennai for a Tamil movie.
What happened?
I had asked your father
for some money in advance.
He said he would give it today.
Dad will come back the day after tomorrow.
No need. Do not call him
at this odd time!
We will see when he comes back.
That's better.
Please get it back to me from Dad
when he comes back.
Don't forget.
Alright.
Go slow, you prick!
Stop there!
How dare you!
Hey!
Show me your face!
Hey!
Stop!
When I got there,
I saw the bicycle alone there.
-Was the cycle there?
-Yes.
Go ahead.
-And then, bro…
-Bro, hold on!
Go on.
I was standing there.
Didn't you beat up those bloody dogs?
I gave a tight slap on his face!
That dog had a cover on his face.
News?
I meant his face was hidden.
With a carry bag?
Yeah, the shopping bag.
A shopper?
The cheap ones.
The polythene cover.
-Is it worth fifty paise?
-Is it not worth fifty paise?
It's not.
Is it worth fifty paise?
Is it not worth fifty paise?
Wait a second.
It's a terrific hook song.
Listen to me first.
Wazi, come here.
-Why?
-Come here.
What's the matter?!
Look there.
Both you and I have an obligation
to protect that guy's pride.
Did you get me?
Why are you overdoing it?
Did I tell you I'm
letting go of him?
I will settle the score with him
before Monday.
Why Monday?
Don't we need at least two days
to trace the guy?
Yes, we need two days.
Any hint?
The bicycle!
Bicycle!
It was a three-fourth cycle, shiny red
In color and straight-handled
It was geared with a water bottle!
I know the bike!
And also, the one who should be kicked!
Targeted.
Hello, friends.
I had an incident yesterday.
As I told you, I took the bike at night
and came out to see the locality.
Suddenly a dude started chasing me.
I was a little scared.
But…
presence of mind is very important
in such circumstances.
My buddy Nahas and I…
bravely chased that jerk away.
Before the bike ride video,
we will upload some of its glimpses
on this channel.
So, stay tuned!
Who's this chic?
Vlogger Beepathu.
Aka Fatima Beevi!
Daughter of Abid's late sister
in Puthanpeedika.
She lives in Dubai with her father.
She might have come
to her mother's house now.
This means, it's an
international love story.
Yes, the same!
So, her mother is no more.
She's a Musical.ly, YouTube
and Instagram sensation!
Her content goes viral in no time!
If the video comes out,
you'll be shamefaced.
The video will be released
the day after tomorrow.
We should have a solid plan.
I have another idea.
What's that?
How about we give a like
and hit the follow button?
I have already done those.
What's in your mind?
Look at me, my love!
My style and my swag
My desires and my aspirations
Are not for you to judge
Got views from the beach, so pretty
Attitude independent, big city
Grind so I got big cheques
I'm young, rich, luxury
Am the one who got trapped
While scrolling
And killing time, in a flow!
Oh Lord! Fulfill my desire!
The one who's stuck in my eyes
I shall stand on your side
I shall watch you nicely
I shall follow you
I shall tell you my name
I shall perceive you clearly
I shall open up my feelings
And slowly get stuck into your heart!
Kerala to the gulf yo
I got the spotlight on me
Came with a dream and secured my spot
Top of the Burj
Yo money's the mood
Got you hungry for a taste
Like you cooking my food
Taking my time, waiting on yeah
Into the wild, rating on yeah
Sinister mind, lover girl
Monopolize, run the world
Locking it down, wearing a crown,
Shackle my wings, wearing it down
They're never gonna
Change this girl, bad bougie
By God, if I see you
It feels like having a meal
With coconut rice, buttermilk, beef--
Hey! Stop there!
You didn't mention popadam
By God, if I see you
It feels like having a meal
With coconut rice
Buttermilk, beef, with popadam
And finishing it with
The punch of a dessert!
It feels the same!
Riding waves, coming with the heat
Followers, they don't see me
Got my boats and jetskis
Tigress looking for my next meal
Bumblebees buzzing in my ears
The mind is trickling
Feeling so chill that it stings my teeth
A vibe so wheeling!
On a fancy trip through the clouds
And the rainbows
Oh Lord! Bestow me with strength!
The one who's stuck in my eyes
I shall stand on your side
I shall watch you nicely
I shall follow you
I shall tell you my name
I shall perceive you clearly
I shall open up my feelings
And slowly get stuck into your heart!
The one who's stuck in my eyes
I shall stand on your side
I shall watch you nicely
I shall follow you
I shall tell you my name
I shall perceive you clearly
I shall open up my feelings
And slowly get stuck into your heart!
Lungs are like sponges.
They are designed to soak up air.
You got to tell it to her face, bro!
Wait for the morning, bro!
Okay, cool.
I'll pee and come.
Sorry, he won't use the ladies' toilet.
It's alright.
Was the toilet clean?
Come.
Aren't you Beevi?
-Yes.
-Let's go, come.
I'm your follower.
Thank you.
-Your videos are awesome!
-Thanks for that as well!
Listen.
What did you do to that
boy who chased you?
Won't it spoil the suspense if I say it?
Be patient. I'll upload the video.
You'll be screwed if
they are not good people.
If someone comes
to screw me up like that,
won't natives like you confront him?
That's true.
-But…
-Sister, come. Let's go.
Go in only with me. Wait there.
And then?
Won't he have people to stand by him?
What if he has any genuine reason?
What if something fell out of your hand
and he chased you to return it?
Or maybe you would have shown him
a finger or something!
And perhaps he didn't like it
and came to beat you up,
mistaking you as a boy.
He might not have realized that
she's a cool girl like you!
So, in your opinion,
how's he going to avenge me?
That depends on how damaging
your upcoming video is!
The guy is not that visible in the video.
It was pretty dark.
But more than enough for fun.
Then, the revenge can be canceled.
Can you avoid uploading that video?
I don't think that my friend
would agree with it.
He got a tight punch on his nose.
He also would want to avenge, right?
Don't worry. I've got another idea.
Will you come to the new shop
in Chanthappadi tomorrow?
I am doing the inauguration.
We'll go there, meet accidentally,
make a video together,
and make fresh content with it.
In that case, no damage for you or me!
Win-win!
Okay, set!
When should I come?
Come there after the Friday prayers.
Shall I click a selfie?
What?!
Do you have an Instagram account?
Awzem.Abdullah.
A-W-Z-E-M.
Okay, bye.
-Hi.
-Bye.
What the fuck!
Cancel all my programmes
till tomorrow afternoon.
I'll be busy.
I'll be busy as well.
Why?
I am busy because of the same reason.
Well, tomorrow, I'll attend prayers
in Chanthappadi tomorrow.
After that, Beevi and I are
making a video at a shop.
Hey, bro! I'm impressed.
So fast!
Enough!
GOOD LOOKS METER
GOOD LOOKS METER
BANG!
WHACK!
BAM!
Bro.
CHAPTER FOUR - HIT HIT HURRAY!
No matter what I say,
this is a business at the end of the day.
The land belongs to them,
and the building is yours.
So, you have the right to make a decision.
However, there are several people
working and surviving around this.
We have to run this theater somehow
for another two months.
Only then they can find some other job.
What are you even saying?
Is there any point
in feeding a crippled horse?
Abdu, that is not the real problem.
After the death of Satish's mother,
this land belongs to all her children.
They are not on good terms now.
They want to somehow sell it
and get their share.
Maybe this could be a temporary problem.
You may take over the theater again
after the business is done.
Let's think about it at that time.
But Abdu, that…
I am not bothered for myself,
but for the workers.
Please talk to Sathish once.
Ask him to give us two months.
Suku? How's it? Any chance?
No chance at all!
let the people go.
Otherwise, they will knock down
all the existing chairs.
It's full of trouble.
What can I do!
Tell them to come with this ticket,
to watch the first show in the evening.
Or refund them tactfully.
Anyway, the first show
should take place today.
Wazi, get me three
cups of black tea there.
Boil water for three cups of tea.
Wazi.
Yes.
One of your dearest people and brother
are coming here to watch the movie
from Dubai.
They want to watch a movie
here in Kerala.
You should treat them well, okay?
There's no matinee show today.
The projector conked out.
Bring them for the first show.
-Oh God! So depressing!
-What happened?
All the effort I took for you
will get wasted!
-What's the matter, man?
-You see who's coming in that car!
-When did she land here?
-She reached Kerala two days back.
That's my fiance's friend with her.
She will be here
for two years for her studies.
So, all the best to you!
Thank you.
It's alright.
You say something and stop her there.
-I will give this tea there and come.
-I'll do it!
He's here!
When will this be ready?
-Our boy will fix it all soon.
-When?
-Wazi.
-This is no new thing here.
This keeps happening.
We took this boy here
to show him a movie in your theater.
Your theater embarrassed us!
He's her brother, from Dubai.
Oh!
Sorry. Our projector conked out.
You can join for the first show.
Hello.
Though he can't speak Malayalam,
he can understand it.
He can speak as well.
Hey, speak in Malayalam to them.
Do you own this shitty place?
It's so stinky here!
Hey boy! Why are you talking this way?
-Show some manners!
-Yeah, tell him clearly!
Why can't you come for the first show?
But that's not a matinee show!
We play the same movie
for the first show as well.
Yet it's not a matinee show, right?
Last time you ditched me after promising
you'll come to take a video?
What if we come today
and the show doesn't happen?
So, you still remember it!
I got busy with something that day.
Anyway, today's show is set!
Please do come.
I somehow managed
to calm down my fans that day.
But he won't calm down like that.
That day we had to take a friend
to the hospital.
Now we won't take him
even if he gets killed!
You come.
We will create new content.
Leave that. You lost that chance.
Let's do something else.
Now, I need to arrange
some entertainment for this boy.
Have you changed your hairstyle?
I…
Shall we go then?
Yeah, sure.
Listen.
Don't come exactly in time
for the show. Come early.
I'll see.
I'll be here. We can catch up afterwards.
Bye.
Have you changed your hairstyle?
Look at how he grins!
Don't mess with my hairstyle.
Okay.
Hello?
Are you not coming for lunch?
-Lunch?
-Yeah, Rajesh and Vikas are here.
Yeah, I'll come.
Then, who's this Omega Babu?
Omega Babu!
Hello, guys!
Omega Babu has arrived!
I called you all here
to give that dog an even bigger welcome.
Do you want to keep a flex board for him?
My foot!
This is a matter of my dignity.
I have told you
I won't let him set his foot here.
You can come with me if you want.
If not, don't come complaining later.
I'm not free, man.
It's my aunt's daughter's wedding.
After all, it's Sathar's
aunt's daughter's wedding!
Will they serve mutton?
Let's postpone it for his next arrival.
I know what to do!
This is a settled issue, right?
It was an orchestra fight
and now they are trying
to compromise the matter.
ANOTHER FLASHBACK
On the way to the airport,
Omega Babu wanted a refill.
Hello, brother.
What just happened?
Shall we go?
Hey!
It's not that bad.
Did you scream out for this?!
The punch has crushed him on the inside.
It won't be visible outside.
I didn't see it,
but those who saw it said so.
What really happened?
Tell me the whole thing.
I came home from there, right?
After leaving there,
I had no peace sitting at home.
So, I immediately went out
in search of Omega Babu.
I went there after knowing that
he was near our Maanu's house.
I thought I would sketch out
his activities and routine.
What is it?
Stop it, Vikas!
Oh.
Then, carry on, Jamshi.
I was sitting casually next to
Irshad's shop and was eating snacks.
No one would come to know
that I was waiting for someone.
Come fast. Else the food will go cold.
You can tell the story later.
Mom, I'm telling them my misery,
and you invite them for a feast?
As if this is the first time!
Come and eat your food.
Then?!
The way he was walking towards me
it looked like he was coming
to tell me something.
So, I thought I would lend an ear.
But, without saying anything,
he came and just kicked me!
Hitting someone for nothing?!
That too twice?!
Get up, Jamshi.
Let's go and put an end to this.
Jamshi.
Listen to this track.
This will wake him up.
Rage of fire
Fury of fire
Rage of fire
He started from the club.
It won't take too long to reach
Konthrakavala from Vandipetta.
How can you be sure?
What if he's late?
No matter how late he is,
we will wait for him.
We should finish off this matter tonight.
-Yes!
-Let's finish it off!
Sathar…
Alright.
We will just catch him.
Let Jamshi alone punch him.
No way, I'll punch him as well.
Your thermometer's crashed
Oh the hellfire!
Oh the hellfire!
Oh the hellfire!
-No special programmes and all.
-Where are you off to?
I'll be back in a moment.
It's my friend.
They just dropped in on their way.
Isn't that Siyad?
Where are you going?
Those were her mother and sisters.
-Siyad.
-Hi, Wazi.
Oh, my!
Vikas.
Fury of rage
Here he comes! Omega Babu!
-Go to the other side.
-Let go of me!
Catch him, okay?
Hold him tight.
-We are screwed! Come Jamshi!
-Why are you holding me?
-Go and catch Omega Babu.
-Get in.
What the hell are you doing?
-What's the matter? He's here!
-He's crazy! Oh! My Cap!
-Shit! Go inside.
-What's wrong?
What's going on?
He's here, you moron!
Reverse the car, Rajesh.
We need to pick him up.
-Not the reverse!
-What about this?
Will deal with it later!
This is a whole new scene.
Where the hell are you going?
Sathar, bring Wazi. Get in fast!
-Get in! Get in!
-Run!
Get going! Get going!
Allah! My son's dhoti!
Wait!
Don't stop, Rajesh! Step up!
Go reverse! Let's see Omega Babu!
My dear Jamshi, let's see to it later!
First, let's flee for our lives!
Isn't that Siyad?
What's your account with him?
There was an unsettled one!
Budge up!
YET ANOTHER FLASHBACK
Hey, stop.
Please give me the ticket and go.
What if I won't?
-You can't enter without a ticket.
-You're strict?!
-Stop kidding, bro. It's a huge rush now.
-Here you go.
Why are you getting mad at me?
Cheers!
It's better you drop me at my home.
Or I'll walk and go.
Don't complain about it later.
Drink this, Jamshi.
I don't want it.
Hand me the car key.
It's been so long sitting here!
Wazi.
She is here.
Shall we go in and catch up with her?
What about Jamshi?
Don't bother about him.
He'll be okay.
Don't even go there now.
-Jamshi.
-What?
Come. His chic is here.
What should I do about it?
It's just us supporting him.
Isn't that what you're all for?
Aren't you all his buddies?
Why don't you all go together?
Why should I come in between?
I'd better go home.
Hey, you!
Don't wait for me.
Take your friends and go.
Wazi…
we are not coming.
You both go inside. We'll be here.
Wazi… you go in.
Everyone cares only about themselves.
Only I'm left with my thing!
Jamshi, we are there for all your things.
You are our priority!
-Give me that soda.
-Here, have it.
Scram, bloody dogs.
Didn't we tell you to go?
Okay, man. Permission granted.
Let's go through the back door.
-That's easier to trace her.
-Okay.
Bro!
Ten o'clock.
Towards there, you dog!
Can you find out for how long
Omega Babu would be here?
He will be here for a week or two.
I'll get you his whole itinerary
with a detailed report.
Where do you want to go now?
Hold this.
Let me think once.
-What's her name?
-Who?
-Wazim's girl.
-Come, let's go and ask.
-Come. Let's go and ask.
-Come, get down.
It's important to know!
-All clear?
-Yes, sir!
Jamshi.
Have a look at every corner here.
What if we also get someone
like Wazim did?!
Shall I give you a tight one?
Is Wazim looking at me?
Hey, that Avikkulam team is here.
Look at Kabaddi Koya!
So what? They came for the movie, right?
Can't they watch a movie?!
Hey, look there.
There's Bolt Hamsa with his gang!
He's retired now after his marriage!
Why are those guys from Saudi
and Pothans sitting together?
Rajesh, can you sense a wrong vibe?
What wrong vibe?!
After all, we've Jamshi with us!
If anything goes wrong,
I'll smash everything to smithereens!
I'm in full charge now.
What?!
Hi, Jamshi!
Okay, get going.
-Move your feet away!
-I won't!
-He's from that Avikkulam gang, right?
-Yes, exactly.
Who?
Come in!
Siyad, stop there.
Sorry, Sister. Watch the movie.
Hey!
Cut the crap, you filth!
You've been going on forever.
What?!
What's your problem?
Hey, wait right there!
What's your freaking problem?
Hey!
What's that?
Hey, you!
Take your degree certificate,
plus-two certificate,
class tenth certificate
and passport to Mathews' travel agency.
Dubai!
Come back only after two years.
POLICE STATION
A vehicle loaded with loads of loads
Two sloth-carts in front, blocking the way
Twists after turns
Turns after twists
Hurry up, oh wretched time!
Hurry up, oh time!
Hurry up, oh time!
Hurry up, oh time!
Hurry up, oh time!
CHAPTER FIVE - EMERGENCY PERIOD!
Does he get angry with you
over silly things?
Hey, nothing like that, Father.
He has no courage for that.
Such problems are common
in stressful work life.
It happens to many people.
It's not a big deal.
Father, that's not the issue.
He used to be a chatterbox.
-He's not like that nowadays--
-Father, what she says is true.
This is not how I used to be.
There's something wrong with me.
I know what it is.
I have confidence
that I can fix it myself.
But I need some time.
If I can't, I'll come to you for sure.
Shall I go now?
You sit and talk to Father for a while.
I'll be there outside.
What's the matter, Sathar?
I heard that news and hence called you.
Oh! Did you get to know?
So, I called to congratulate you.
Thank you, Sathar.
-Thank you.
-Are you alone there?
Yeah, I'm alone now.
Okay, bye.
Okay.
NEW BURNO GRILLS
She thanked me when I congratulated her.
But she didn't sound happy.
Did she ask about me?
She asked if I was alone.
What did you reply?
I told her that I was alone.
Call her once again.
But why?
-Call her.
-But why, Wazi?
Let me test it.
What?
I want to hear how she thanks me.
Sathar, give him the phone.
Let him take an earful.
Give me the phone.
-Hello?
-Hey, Pathu.
Why don't you smile anymore, Pathu?
Come on, Pathu.
Listen to me, Pathu!
This song's for you, Pathu!
Stop being haughty, Pathu!
Switch your mode, Pathu
Stop being tough, Pathu!
Listen clearly, Pathu!
Come to me, come here, Pathu!
Stay close to me, Pathu!
Don't stand!
Sit down, Pathu!
Dunk me into your heart, Pathu!
Hey, Beepathu!
Just be, Pathu!
Whatever cruise you may be in
I know you're crucified!
Inside your cottage
I know you wept hard!
Although you're alone on a high peak
Your soul is crushing high on my love!
I know that very well, Pathu
Why don't you tell me then, Pathu!
Don't you want me, Pathu?
Don't you lie, Pathu?
You can't live without me, Pathu
Oh, my dear
Yeah, baby!
My love!
Does it hurt when you're poked
By the little finger of love?
Does it hurt when
The hinges of your heart thrust in love?
Does it hurt when
The feelings down the throat choke you?
It will hurt
Enough, Pathu!
Feel me, Pathu!
I don't cry even when it punctures my soul
I don't get it, no matter
How hard I learn!
I'm so out of my mind, Pathu!
My heart is so entangled in love, Pathu!
It doesn't cut off
Even with scissors, Pathu!
Since long I've waited
For a glance of yours, Pathu!
Why don't you smile then, Pathu?
You've given me so many fortunes, Pathu!
Yet, you've given me hardships too, Pathu!
I feel so queasy now, Pathu!
My heart pounds when I try to rest, Pathu!
I look for you
And my quest never ends, Pathu!
I've been on top
And hit rock-bottom, Pathu!
You save me
I save you
May the Lord Almighty save us!
Oh, my dear
If you're done, listen to me now, boy!
You don't really know this Pathu, boy!
I'm an oil field, boy!
A historical war zone, boy!
What you've got ain't enough, boy!
I got more demands, boy!
Need lines that fit into the meter, boy!
Need full stops for commas, boy!
Want to get it bugless, boy!
Need supremacy for solitude, boy!
A Ballon d'Or for Neymar, boy!
Petrol for 50 rupees in India, boy!
Don't start blabbering, boy!
Coppola will make my biopic!
I'm someone who isn't discoverable
I'm a La La Land you can't help but peer!
You'll be in trouble if you come closer
You'll be damaged
If you try to outsmart me!
Shall I give you a peck on your cheek
Which otherwise receives
Only punches from others?
No, Pathu! No, Pathu!
No, Pathu! No, Pathu!
Don't, Pathu!
Let it be, Pathu!
But listen to me, Pathu!
If you're an international championship,
I'm Lionel Messi, Pathu!
Don't, Pathu!
Soar up then, Pathu!
Don't sit idle, Pathu!
Soar up, Pathu!
Soar up high, Pathu!
But however high you fly
Whatever spaceship you're in
Whatever shape you may be
I've got only one thing to say, Pathu!
Peace be upon you, Pathu!
ANS TEA SHOP
I have no one to back me…
other than the backstory.
What's in your mind?
Are you ready for a one-on-one?
Life is not a mere cycle, Wazi.
It's a cycle without a break.
SALUTE TO SI REJI.
Friends…
wishing all the best to our brother Reji,
who has successfully cleared
the SI selection.
There have been many tiffs and spats
between us on many occasions.
We are aborting all of it now
with this party.
Here I invite the man of the night,
Reji Mathew, to say a few words.
I start by thanking
the upcoming abkari Mr. David,
once a pain in our neck,
and now the apple of our eyes,
for hosting this party.
Davy, we love you!
Let's celebrate.
The one who took the initiative
to negotiate
and end the fallouts
and tiffs between us,
which were a constant
headache for our families,
for our Mr. Cherian.
Special thanks to him.
Love you.
To be frank,
David has been trying for this
for quite some time.
It was me who got it late.
The irony is, now I'll have
to respect the cops as well.
That's correct.
No more preaching!
We announce a stop to our fights
by drinking this!
Cheers.
CHAPTER SIX - CEASEFIRE RESOLUTION
-Cheers!
-Cheers.
Can't you wait for him to start this?
This is a mere warm-up.
We will booze properly
only after he comes!
We've not opened the
bottle he brought yet.
Sathar, you must try two pegs today.
That's a must.
Jamshi.
On one hand, grand palaces
in the valleys where streams flow,
silk beds on high ceiling chambers,
loaded cups,
-and hot girls to hang out with!
-Wow!
On the other hand,
soul-destroying intoxication
that causes havoc in
this world and beyond.
What do you choose from these?
I need it all.
Why do you only advise me?
Don't they want any of these?
That's right, why do you only advise him?
We also need all those.
-Don't you want?
-Of course!
If you invite such guys to a party,
they will spoil it in no time.
-Correct.
-We also have parties.
-Where? In your home?
-Not here, but there!
It will be even more terrific.
Won't you take us there along with you?
If I get a ticket, I will
take you all as well.
Count me in.
Darlings!
Straight from Dubai!
-Darling!
-Darling!
-Welcome to Ponnani!
-Welcome to Ponnani!
What took you so long
to get here from home?
I thought I would eat from home and come.
It's been two years, right?
It's fresh fish.
I bought it from the beach.
Have it.
Do you want fish fry?
Mom says my Dad still eats
only after the time of the second show.
Poor thing!
He didn't eat with me.
Then I went to our theater.
Sentiments?
Will he make us cry now?
Rajesh.
Who's in charge of our theater now?
A team from Tirur.
Why did you ask?
-What if we take over the food court?
-That's cool.
My dad can handle it.
-You ask them once.
-I will.
Vikas, weren't you seeking
a gentleman to accompany you
for your bride-seeing ceremony tomorrow?
Here you go!
A gentleman imported from Dubai.
Rajan.
Don't we have any programmes for today?
Will set up.
Go for it, then.
You go for it!
-Go for it, man!
-Yeah! Go for it!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
If they are asking you to shut up
Make some noise
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Hate Club.
The first rule of Hate Club is
to not talk about Hate Club.
The second rule of Hate Club is that
you will not at all talk about Hate Club!
You scram!
You scram!
Make some noise!
Amplify it!
Shame!
Hey, Raja
Hey, Raja!
Wear your clothes!
Hey, Raja!
-Shame!
-Oh, no!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
Don't make me sad, Dad!
Can you give me some money?
Too haughty, dude?
Can you greet me with a hi?
Can you give me a smile?
Can you give one more?
Can you give me your heart
Instead of a shout?
Give it to us
Give it to us
Give it to us
Give us some peace!
Shake a leg!
Shake a leg!
Shake a leg!
Shake it!
Shake a leg!
Shake it!
I have something to say.
Wazim should change his shirt.
After all, it's me who's going
to see the bride. Have some respect!
Then, I also have something to say.
You also should change your shirt.
Look at yourself!
I was hesitant to say this.
It's good that you initiated the topic.
I wanted to say this first.
-Did you feel it?
-I did!
-I felt it first!
-I felt it even before.
What about you?
He felt the same.
-This looks like a stage performance one!
-I'll change it!
Will you change?
-Yeah, sure.
-But I'll choose a dress for you.
Yeah, I'll wear the one you choose for me.
-Then go to George's shop.
-Yeah, go.
Yeah, go.
George!
With love gushed within the soul
With a garland
Strung with dreams
Here arrives the groom--
Hey!
Hey! What the!
What are you doing?!
How dare you molest a woman!
Who molested her?
Did you see it?
-Take him and scram.
-Yes, we will! You come with us!
We know them. Please don't
create an issue out of this.
-Yeah, I also know him.
-Listen.
It was not accidental.
He did it deliberately.
-Who are you, loser?
-What's the matter with you, you pest?
How dare you answer back!
-Don't create a ruckus!
-To heck with you!
-No! Jamshi!
-Come.
-Move from here.
-I won't spare you!
You won't get off easily from here.
Get lost!
Sathar, you take the car.
Hey!
Reji.
They are young boys.
A trouble?
Seems like trouble!
Hey!
Come here!
Come, let's see.
Okay, I'll call and update you.
Alright.
-Cheriyan.
-Tell me.
No matter who files the case,
it will be trouble for us.
Try to settle it amicably if possible.
Don't you know how much effort
we took to get you this section?
Settle the issue before your
father or brother learns this.
We'll take care of it.
Reji, I'll also come with you.
Wait here, Davy.
Yes, Mom.
It's a minor accident.
We're in the hospital.
No, I'm alright.
No, no need to come here.
We are about to leave from here.
You call and inform them.
Hey, mate.
Bro, that was a mistake from our end.
We got the wrong information.
Sir says, we should not take it ahead
and make it worse.
Filing a case would land us in a mess.
You know it, right?
Should we make it worse?
I'll settle your hospital bills.
You don't worry.
We'll handle it.
Don't you have an NRI with you?
Doesn't he need to go back
to the Middle East?
I don't mind if I can't go to Dubai.
Bro, enough of your sermon.
Just get out of our sight.
We'll go as well after
the rituals are done.
-Well, there are no formalities, right?
-Bro, I was just saying.
It was for your own good.
If the cops don't want it,
we too don't want it!
You may go.
We'll go.
That's better.
Shall we go?
Bye.
What's your name?
Reji.
I'm Wazim.
What if we are okay with the trouble
that comes with this case?
It will trouble you!
What if it won't trouble us?
It will trouble you.
And then, it will trouble me.
Why is that so?
There won't be any case.
Vamos!
Beat him!
Come on, Wazi!
Wazi!
Knock him down.
Come on, Reji! Kick him.
The first kick should be
right on his chest.
We can abstain from fights.
But if you've decided to fight,
you should hit at once.
Else, you will miss the aim.
And once you cut the balance,
that "hit" will come back to you.
This is that sort of a fight.
Do you want to hit first?
Wazi.
This is a one billion fight!
CHAPTER SEVEN - BLOWN BY MELO BEAT
A video of vlogger Beepathu
beating down a guy
is going viral in social media.
This act of Beepathu has shocked
millions of her fans.
Beepathu, who reacted promptly
to the guys who misbehaved--
People will identify me in this.
What if my mother sees this?
Not only you but
people will identify all of us.
So, what's the problem?
Sathar, give me your phone.
Let me call my aunt.
Just shut up.
My Mom is mad at me
and went to my aunt's place.
Let me call her and solve the issue.
-Will you have a peg?
-Yeah, one for me.
-Take it.
-Moreover, she is irritated that
I didn't go and
see that bride.
Who do I complain to?
-Sathar, give me that phone.
-Hold this.
Yes, Dad.
Where are you?
-In Jamshi's place.
-Don't be late.
Okay, hang up.
Wazi? Is he mad at you?
Say something.
Just talk to me.
I thought you had something to tell me.
I've nothing to say.
You talk, I'll listen.
I'm thinking of going back.
But you have just come here, right?
Feeling timid.
Timid? You?!
Dad…
-This--
-Don't tell me how this happened.
Tell me if I should expect
any revenge fight--
No! It's me who got beaten up.
That too when I was not wrong.
But I left that matter.
I'll stay away for a while.
That's all.
Dad.
Shall we take over its food court when
they revamp our theater to a multiplex?
I've asked Rajesh to enquire about it.
It is not time for you to settle here.
You work in abroad
for a few more days.
I am not moving permanently here.
This will be my extra business.
Moreover, you won't get bored here.
Really?
Who told you that I was getting bored?
You look at yourself, Dad.
Your hair has gone all gray.
Why are you not coloring your hair?
Gray is often stylish,
just like our superstar Ajith!
When are you planning to go?
I'm just thinking about it.
Let's have dinner together.
Okay.
Pick up the call.
-Hello
-Wazi.
Tell me, Sathar.
That loser, Vikas!
Me?
This is Sathar's phone.
Don't you remember the guy
you hit yesterday? Wazim!
I'm his friend, Vikas.
I don't want to talk
about it over the phone.
We will talk in person.
Beevi called me back.
She wants to meet you in person.
When?
Now.
Today is not possible.
I have something else to do.
-Give her my number.
-Are you not coming?
Come.
-Hello?
-Wazim, it's me, Beevi.
Hey! Tell me.
Can you come out? I'm here.
Yeah, sure.
Why are you all here?
To beat me up?
We can do that as well. You want to see?
Ask your friend to show some decency
while talking on the phone at night!
Ask him to dare and call me again.
Can I have a word with Beevi
in private?
You can talk to her in front of us.
Come on, let's have a word.
So, what have you got to say?
Nothing much.
Vikas shouldn't have behaved that way.
It's not my mistake.
Yet I am sorry.
Now you may say.
What?
The first hit was out of reflex.
I can understand.
In such a situation,
I too could've done the same.
But the second one,
it was after you recognized me.
This is your chance to say sorry.
I'm not used to it!
Okay.
Nevermind. Just give me a reason.
Reason…
I'm also not clear about it.
I'll let you know if I get it.
Alright.
I'll be around for
a few more days.
I will call you and ask sometime.
Okay.
You may save my contact.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Shall I go and sleep?
Okay!
Okay? Bye!
Darlings!
Everything's sorted out.
Let's go! Come on!
Dear, you got to be careful
about that boy!
He's quite a brat!
He snatched my son's cloth
when the bride's family visited our house!
My heart sank seeing it!
I've made him pay for that!
That's how he escaped to Dubai.
He's scared of me!
Even the theater got shut down
because of his misconduct.
Calling it misconduct is not right.
I've seen it with my own eyes!
Stop the bus!
Where are you rushing to?
To buy acidity drugs for your mom!
Really?
Does he have any sense?
He had beaten up a guy
in front of his mom on the public road!
Beat up a son in front of his mom?
Yeah, dear!
One of them is Abdu's son.
And the other one, Haider's son.
Okay.
So, my punch didn't go to waste!
Oh Lord! Bestow me
Oh Lord! Fulfill--
Oh Lord! Fulfill my desire!
Oh Lord! Bestow me with strength
Wazi, do you know him?
Hey! Don't you know him?
I think I've seen his face.
I don't remember him
but he seems familiar.
Jamshi?
I've seen him somewhere.
Fahad…
tell us the story in which
you lost your tooth!
Why do you want to hear that now?
Sounds interesting! Go ahead!
-It's not so interesting to me!
-Come on. Tell us!
Back then, during my college days,
I was coming home
after losing in a tournament.
I then saw a man hurting
and abusing an old woman.
And I turn into Hulk when I get angry!
I punched him hard!
That woman started sobbing
and wanted me to stop.
Hey, isn't this your story?
Yeah! Isn't this our story, Jamshi?
Is this story like this?
The story itself has changed!
It's the same story, but it's different.
Oh, dear! So, was it you?
Yeah, it was me!
Jamshi, tell them the story!
Let me tell you.
I mean, it's not
such a big deal.
We were going somewhere,
for an issue Vikas got into!
Wazim told me not to stop,
and to not bother about anything.
But I had to stop as I saw
an old hag weeping in public!
She wanted the guy
to stop hitting her son.
And I see a guy hitting her son
in full force!
I couldn't let it go!
I got down from the car
and kicked him hard!
Mother!
Oh, no!
Sorry, dear.
Was it you?
You have any idea
-what happened after you left?
-No!
The son got up and started
beating up his mom!
And what did you do to him?
We left it to Wazim.
What did you do?
Nothing much.
I taught him a lesson on
how to respect parents. That's all.
So, my aunt saw that. Got it?
Yeah!
Wait, what?
You've totally become
a Dubai guy, Wazim!
Yeah, right? I too realized it
when I got back here.
So, don't you look back at your old self?
No way!
Only my look has changed.
I'm still that old me!
Not just the look.
The way you smell as well.
Really?
Yeah.
I didn't get the answer.
For this one.
Oh, that…
I felt like punching you then.
My brother was with me when we
came to the theater the other day.
-Okay.
-And it got so annoying!
I reserved this punch for you since then?!
But I couldn't meet you after that!
So, I decided to hit you only
when I got a hold of you!
So, you didn't visit Dubai
all this while? I was there!
I had gone once.
I came back after two days.
Did you just visit twice in two years?
Have you ever visited here?
I came here to attend Jamshi's
mom's funeral ceremony.
My dad is trying to get a hold of me.
My ex was quite a prick!
So, I put him in a mess!
And I had to flee from there!
That's when I thought of
getting my post graduation done.
And how's the degree going on?
Well…
it's screwed!
You were stalking me
for a long time, right?
Yeah, that was when I was
too immature!
Don't we use to eat mud
when we were little?
I will…
go back the day after tomorrow.
When are you coming to Dubai?
They're calling me back.
I got to think about it.
Yeah, think about it!
-Hello?
-Hey, Sathar!
-Yeah.
-I'm not going.
-Inform Wazim.
-But…
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. I'm not going.
Alright, okay.
Wazi.
Beevi is not going.
What's your plan?
Why should I not go?
She just called him
and said that she isn't going!
Yeah!
So what? How does it matter to me?
Someone we know.
Isn't that all?
Yeah, why are you
getting angry for that?
-So, let's go?
-Yeah, let's go!
Let me pee first.
Forget about others, Sathar.
What kind of a friend are you?
Why?
Why aren't you forcing me, you loser?
For what?
To stay back, you loser!
Yeah, couldn't you just stay back?
Won't they think that I'm not going
because she's not going?
Actually, why aren't you going?
-Because she's not going!
-Oh, I see!
Let them know
without hurting my pride.
Don't tell them the reason.
You want to save your pride, right?
I'm on it!
Come on.
-Rajesh!
-Yes.
Drive back home.
He's not going.
Why?
He's deeply in love with Beevi!
-He can't leave her alone.
-I see!
Well, Wazi, what's your plan?
Nothing as such!
Haven't you got
any shame, you loser?
It's been three to four years
since you've going behind her.
Go and tell her your feelings.
and come back with a rejection.
Don't bottle up your feelings.
What? Why will she reject me?
Let it be whatever!
Let's go straight to her place.
We're fed up with this!
We'll go straight to her place,
and tell her this.
Nothing more or less.
Can you do it?
-Is it a challenge?
-Yeah!
No, it's an advice, mate.
Go tell her your feelings.
She is so bold.
You got to tell it to her face, bro!
Exactly!
What's the point of
blabbering here instead?
Hey, if Wazim decides something…
-Then?
-Then?
my friends have to get it done!
Yeah, that sounds right!
Do one thing. Call her.
Call her right now and tell her
that you're not going.
Come on, do it!
Here, take it.
-Hello?
-Hello.
I too canceled my journey.
Why is that so?
Well… I have to clear a doubt.
Yeah, go ahead.
-I thought of clearing it in person.
-Yeah, come here then.
Where are you now?
I'm near the harbor.
Come straight here!
-Are you alone?
-I can come alone!
No, you don't have to!
Bring your friends. There are some
interesting hot chicks here!
Yeah! Okay!
Let me get down then.
I got to arrange a few people.
-Sathar!
-Hey!
Come on in.
A fighting rooster!
A six foot, good-looking
Romantic flirt!
A fighting rooster!
A fighting rooster!
A six foot, good-looking
Romantic flirt!
A fighting rooster!
One of the most powerful blows
He has ever endured
Her melody… melody…
Is mesmerizing!
Her melody… melody…
Is mesmerizing!
Here he comes
littering amusing blunders
all over the trail of love.
Who is he?
He is our Majnu.
How is he coming?
He is riding a horse.
Laila is standing there.
Where is Laila standing?
She is standing on the alley of rainbows,
in a flower nursery
like a Sidrat al-Muntaha alluringly
bloomed with florets of light!
How do I express this?
-Why didn't you go?
-Why did you cancel your journey?
I was testing you!
You want to hang out with me for a while?
Can give it a shot!
The charming beauty
Who captivated his mind
She is a beaming flower!
She is the gorgeous Husnul Jamal
He's in Badrul Muneer's condition!
Magnificent…
Meaningful…
Manifest…
They're madly in love!
He is the one who's been
Bestowed upon by the stream of love
Which is the essence
Of the beautiful universe
The heartbeat raises its rhythm
In the crescent moon night
All thanks to her melody
Her melody of love
The hero and the heroine are
getting ready to compete in the race
to reach the story's epilogue
through twattles and squabbles!
Who is the hero?
He is the insane Mammad.
And the heroine?
She is the zealous Ummukulsu.
On your mark.
Get, set, ego!
-Don't!
-No! We won't!
The lovers should not have!
What?
Now, you can! What?
The love talks, the sweet talks…
Their echoes…
The love-tinged conversation
Between the smart couple!
Give me precedence
To be your heart's guard
Oh, crazy lover!
Come mastering the eminent skills of love!
Her eyebrows gestured
A flair of approval
Platters are filled with savories
Adorned with nectar of love
The trivial poetry will continue
Suiting the rhythm of melody…
Her melody is mesmerizing
Melody…
Her melody is mesmerizing
Well, honey…
shall I ask you something?
Did you agree to marry me soon
to stay back in India?
Not just that.
You're good-looking and
decently mannered.
So, I thought I'll give it a try!
So, what's next after marriage?
-Don't you know all that?
-Not that!
Are we going to stay here
or go there after marriage?
My dear Wazim,
-aren't we here now?
-Yeah!
Just be here!
Come closer.
Let me kiss you.
-Come closer!
-I see!
Oh, my!
Damn!
CHAPTER - EIGHT
UN"BEAT"ABLE FRIENDSHIP - TWO
We don't just hit a punch.
Sometimes, we get punched as well.
The one who has the capacity to
accept a punch can give it back as well.
Some punches must be welcomed
and some others must be given.
You need to wait and
watch the end of this fight.
Let's see!
Hello?
Hello!
Remember me?
Hello.
What's up? I'm here
for shopping with my wife.
-And him?
-Brother-in-law.
-What's your name?
-Shafi. I'm his brother-in-law.
-He's my close buddy!
-Okay.
Tell him whatever you need.
-He's a friend of mine.
-Okay, sir.
-We're here to shop for something small.
-There's nothing small or big here!
He's dear to me.
-Help him with whatever he needs.
-Okay.
Wazi, let me go check it.
Yeah. I--
Hey, sorry.
Sorry for what happened that day.
You know the situation, right?
Yeah. Let it go.
It won't be good if we hold onto it.
I would've been in trouble
if you went ahead with the case.
I had just got selected
to be the sub-inspector.
Now I'm placed with a good job.
I don't work at this police station.
I am at Kunnamangalam.
I got to join after a month.
Will you come to a party if I invite you?
What party?
Get your friends along.
Let's have a blast!
No need for any of that.
Consider that we parted ways
on that day itself.
Well… it's for my peace of mind.
It's not that. I'm getting married.
Wow! Are you getting married?
Awesome! Congrats!
So, I have no choice but to
stay away from such things!
Yeah, that's right.
So, when is the marriage?
It's on the 21st of this month.
-This is--
-Brother-in-law.
-Shall we leave?
-Okay.
-Thanks, bro!
-Welcome!
-You got it done, right?
-Yeah!
Be there a day
before the wedding.
-Don't forget!
-Of course, we'll rock!
Don't forget to get the invitation
if you're coming to the auditorium.
Of course not!
Else, we'll have to trouble the groom
by bringing him to the gate!
I got the invitation on WhatsApp!
This is from my side.
You won't get this dignity on WhatsApp!
Yeah, right! But why
are you being so formal?
-Shall we go?
-Yeah!
Wazim weds Fatima.
So, congrats!
-Come for marriage!
-Sure!
You loser, how dare you
invite him for marriage?
You gave him a card and yet you say
it wasn't serious.
No! He's a decent man!
He won't come!
He's wicked.
He will come!
I don't like him!
If he comes to your marriage,
I'll lose my cool!
-Mine as well.
-Same here.
I will lose my calm as well.
He must've invited you out of formality.
It's a shame if you decide to go
based on that.
Even if he goes,
it doesn't bring any shame!
And if you don't go,
he won't even realize it.
Right?
The card design is nice, right?
Yeah. Not bad.
Reji… why are you
so confused about this?
He's a nice guy.
And it'd be fun to hang out with them.
In that case, let's go a day before!
And if the vibe is good,
we'll stay till the marriage day.
You guys don't have to come.
I'll go.
It won't be good if we go as a gang.
You're neither going as a gang, nor alone.
What's wrong with you, Reji?
Davy… Kalappurakkal David…
Hello?
Hey, Wazim! It's me, Reji.
We've reached Chamravattam junction.
Do we take the Ponnani road,
or the Kuttipuram road?
I'm not clear.
Can you please share the location?
-Wazim.
-Yeah!
I'll send the location on WhatsApp.
-Sure!
-Come over.
-Sumi?
-You could just keep it there!
Sumi, can we just take this off?
What?!
Can we clean off the mask?
-Let it stay for ten more minutes!
-I'll apply it later.
No way! The mix is finished!
Don't mess with me, Wazim!
-This is enough! My friend is on the way.
-Really?
Malu! Workmates from
Wazim's company are coming over!
Can you tell him the route?
It's Reji, the jewelry guy…
Okay! How many of them are coming?
-Just one guy.
-Okay.
Or there could be four to five people!
Hello! Come over! I'll guide you!
Hey!
Wazim's brother-in-law is here. Open!
Hey, Reji!
-Brother!
-Welcome!
-Hope we're not late!
-No, the things are just about to start!
-Who are they?
-He's Davy.
Hello!
-He's Rajan.
-Hello.
-There's no place to park the car…
-We can't say his name in public!
Hello!
Shukkoor… ask them to unload
the things in the backyard.
He's Wazim's friend. Reji.
-And they're his friends.
-Rajan.
-He's the father.
-Greetings!
Well, where's he? Wazi?
He went to wash off his face mask!
He asked me to take care of them.
Yeah, I'm also assigning Shafi
to take care of all of you!
No need to take care of us!
We're here to take care of
the whole marriage itself!
-Father… where do I park the car?
-Our parking is on that side, right?
Father, if we remove
these lights till here,
we can park a lot of cars
in this area. There's an exit there
We can park there
once this area is filled!
-That's right!
-Okay.
Shukkoor… Ask our guys to
get it done soon!
Why others? We can do it ourselves!
-Come on! Let's do it!
-Come on.
-Start removing from there!
-Careful about the electric cables!
Shafi, it would've been better
if we'd got them yesterday itself!
Yeah, right.
Sathar… get them and come over!
Reji is here.
And he's not alone.
-You should pay for my idea!
-Could've done it earlier itself!
Hey, Wazi…
The route was mentioned in the invitation!
That's to the auditorium, right?
Not to your home!
Wazim… are you ready?
Come, let's sit inside.
-Why do you look tense?
-Nothing!
Is it because of your marriage?
Don't worry, we're here!
Malu, let me serve this to them!
-Keep a watch on the items on the stove!
-Okay.
Have that jalebi!
Ladoo? No, don't give it to Davy!
He's diabetic!
Here, dears! I've got
a special item for you!
If it is Rukhiyatha's special,
it's gonna be awesome! Have it!
-What's this? Whose special?
-We can use it as appetizers!
It's Rukhiyatha's special!
Oh, Rukhiyatha! Aced it!
-Thank you, son!
-It's yummy! Can I have some more?
I made less of the special dish.
Hey! Don't make noise!
If we serve this as a dish,
it'd be stunning!
I don't know how to deal with it.
I'll lose it!
Don't worry, boys!
I'll take care of this scene.
You just follow.
-Hello! When did y'all arrive?
-Some time back.
What's up?
-Oh! Your whole gang is not here?
-They're his friends.
Show some sincerity, not just in clothes,
but also, in doing work!
They had to arrive to sort out
the parking confusion.
How can you say that, Shafi?
Are we the fools now, to go out,
expecting you to sort it out?
Hey, sit down.
We've got Rukhiyatha's special!
How could they sit?
They're the family!
-They should be hosting it!
-We're family too, now!
Be active, Sathar!
Yeah.
Now that they are here,
I'll be a bit busy.
It's my only brother-in-law's marriage!
-Yeah, we know!
-You got to look after everything!
Sit down, bro!
How could you go?
Alright. You better sit.
And we'll be upstairs,
for the nuptial room decoration.
-Yeah, go ahead!
-See you around.
Come on.
Wait. Give them company!
You be here!
Jamshi, what's on your mind?
Vikas, let's serve them food.
They'll have it and leave!
After that, this venue is all ours!
Yeah, get rid of those losers soon!
Getting rid is only for these two days!
I'll beat them up for sure!
Let this marriage get over!
Of course, Jamshi!
They're already trapped.
Yet, they're putting up such a show!
One more thing, Sathar.
This is our plan.
Don't go and jabber it to Wazim!
Let him get married and have a life!
Let him go to Dubai first!
I'm also with you after that!
Whatever it is, I won't get married
until I pay these losers back!
-Brilliant! That's the spirit!
-Yes!
Let's handle
those pricks at the portico!
Hey! They're not here to annoy us!
Then?
Their arrival itself annoyed us, Wazi!
Tell me what to do.
I'll do it!
My dear Wazi,
you don't have to do anything.
Just be here, as the groom.
We'll handle the rest. Okay?
Come on, guys!
Smiling like a jasmine
Voice so melodious like a koel
Oh blushing bride
The groom of your alluring dreams
What's he doing?
Wazi, are you in Mom's team or Dad's team?
-Don't confuse him.
-No, no!
-He's clicking the photo!
-Look there!
Look there, kiddo!
The groom of your alluring dreams
-Salad…
-Hey, serve him some salad!
Hey, he didn't mention the word "bro".
Tell me your names!
Yeah, I forgot!
That's Biju. He's Davy.
If you need anything,
just shout "Davy" and he'll be there!
-Rajan.
-Yeah!
-Hey, tell him your name.
-Dhanish.
I don't get it.
I'm Jamshi.
He's Rajesh.
Hey!
This is Vikas.
The situation in which we met the other
day wasn't apt for introductions!
It's only your names that we don't know!
It's not difficult to recognize you.
How can we forget!
Flaunting golden necklaces all around
The bride glimmers with elegance
Smiling like a jasmine
Voice so melodious like a koel
Oh blushing bride
The groom of your alluring dreams
Here he arrives
Here he arrives
Delectable and enchanting
Sweet-sixteen
Amorous comfort of the charming night
On the floret-like body of the bride
Delectable and enchanting
On the floret-like body of the bride
Reji!
They make it tranquil
-Come on, hurry up!
-He's calling us!
Smiling like a jasmine
Voice so melodious like a koel
Come on!
Be active! Feed him well!
Feed him whatever you can grab!
Here, have it! Come on!
Come on, quick!
-Hey! We took this!
-Relax, dude!
Have it! Yeah! Have!
Come on. This one, too!
Enough feeding!
Let's take the photos now!
Yeah, click the photos!
Let go of my hand!
Yeah! Click!
Hey! My uncle was looking for
such a vintage model car.
Do you know Rajesh?
The one with a beard.
He's dealing with such things.
We can ask him!
Ask him?! Aren't we leaving now?
We've shown enough courtesy.
There's an overall fun vibe.
A nice mood.
-They're also nice.
-Yeah, they're nice guys.
Can't we stay back?
People are being nice
not because they like us.
It's because they're nice people.
Aren't we nice as well?
But we have made a mistake.
They know that we have regrets about it.
Reji…
when they came to acquaint with us,
they took the exact details.
Jamshi has got a wrong vibe.
Why are you talking like the cops?
Really? If the cops don't think
the way they should, at least I have to!
Let's do this.
Stay back here today.
Let's find a stay nearby,
attend the marriage tomorrow,
click a photo, and leave!
Anyway, we've come this far!
Hey, Davy…
when they're in need some day…
they would have a bond
to seek help from us.
That's all I want.
Just for my peace of mind.
Besides, they're nice.
Don't get worried.
No worries. We'll have to initiate
if at all something goes wrong.
Of course! That's right!
Let's stay back in a hotel and booze.
We've got booze in the car, right?
-Yeah, we have.
-Let's go, then?
Should we invite them as well?
Are you crazy?
Do you have any plans in mind?
Why are you panicking, dude?
We aren't fools to spoil your wedding!
Nothing went wrong till now, right?
Wazi…
we're annoyed.
We don't have any plans as such!
Let's go down.
It's not right to talk here.
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go.
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
At her portico
At her portico
How long have you been
Hanging around there?
Even her shape changed!
And it's almost time
Even grass started growing
Under his feet
Even grass started growing
Under his feet
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Sweet lips laden with a slender smile
Oh beauty who looked into my eyes
Sweet lips laden with a slender smile
Oh beauty who looked into my eyes
Can you tell me who you are?
Can you tell me your name?
I'll come as your lover
Will you come as my darling?
Belle!
Bracing blossom!
Belle!
Bracing blossom!
Get up, Wazim!
Wazi! Boy!
It's your marriage today!
Good morning, Romeo!
Get up! It's your marriage!
-Come on! Hurry up!
-Let's go.
-We're running out of time.
-Let's go.
-Have some coffee.
-Have it.
You don't want it?
Wow! Wazim gave up coffee!
Where are your buddies?
They'll be here soon.
Reji… the nuptial room
isn't as grand as it should be.
Shall we put up some rose flowers?
It's our boy's marriage!
Make it colorful, Rajan!
Biju, hurry up then!
Rajesh, is this how you set up
the nuptial room?
What's a nuptial room without roses?
Rajan, put this on the other end.
You're just watching?
Hurry up and get ready!
It's time to leave for the marriage!
Get ready!
Where's the shirt? Get the shirt
and the trousers! You got a coat?
Coat?
Turn around, let me see!
Awesome!
What's this? Is this the watch
you're going to wear?
Davy, get him another one!
We've got a superb one!
Black and black don't go well.
Here, take your watch. Rajesh!
See! This is nice!
You got to have such a contrast.
-Such a pain!
-Wait, we will get a chance.
It's not fitting in!
This suits with black!
Hello, what's this?
They've been calling you since long time!
-Hurry up!
-Yeah, we'll be right there!
They'll say such things,
but let's click pictures. Come on!
-Come on, Rajesh!
-Come on! What's wrong with you?
-Come.
-You're more shy than the groom himself!
Yeah! Smile!
Move to the side, Rukhiyatha!
-Biju! Hey, Biju!
-One second.
Ask them to get in, Shukkoor!
It's already late!
Brother-in-law and sister
too can get in if you want!
-Take some people to the bus.
-Careful.
I had asked that boy
to check it well before delivery!
Stop panicking!
Let's arrange another car!
No need to arrange another car.
Get into the ones here, it's already late!
-Let's get them to our car!
-Yeah, come on!
-We can go in our car!
-Come on, hop in!
Come on! Come!
Carry him into our car!
Yeah, get in!
-Get in!
-We'll be late if we just watch!
-Get in, everybody!
-Start the cars!
Come on! Move!
-Rajesh, you should've checked it before!
-No, Dhanish!
-Screwed…
-Let's go, Jamshi!
If anyone wants to get in,
we have space!
-Davy, get them into your car!
-Yeah!
-Go!
-Fold the rear seat!
Hey, Biju!
-Come to this one, Biju!
-Fold the seat!
Get in! Come on, Rajesh!
Yeah, let's go!
Go ahead, Reji!
We'll be right behind you!
We'll arrange a better car
when we bring the bride. Right, Reji?
Don't worry! How many such cases
have we handled!
How will you come, Dhanesh?
-I'll reach. You guys carry on.
-Alright.
Just listen to what I say!
Fix the Audi and bring it before 12.
-Aren't you the driver, you idiot?
-What's wrong with him?
Send me your live location!
Can't you understand what I say?
Chill, bro.
The car will reach there.
Bro… when we go for an auspicious
function, we should be the happiest!
Just chill!
-You have enough space to sit?
-I'm okay, bro!
And he's got a fat bum.
Let him sit well. Right?
Make some space, Rajesh.
-Come on, bro.
-Nevermind, we'll be there soon!
-No, it's fine. Sit properly.
-We got space? Yeah.
Budge up a bit.
So, how are the rituals, Wazim?
Boring like ours?
Nothing as such.
It's just a handshake.
But it'll take a while
for the speeches to end.
Oh! You too have speeches?
It's like that for them.
Imam's speech and all--
Anyway, what are they saying
in such speeches?
-The things we usually hear about.
-Usual things…
The wedding photo session
bored me out the most!
My cheeks ached from smiling
non-stop for two to three hours!
Even now, I feel traumatic
seeing my wedding album!
Budge up a bit.
Don't you remember, Rajan?
I couldn't even have a peg
and was damn annoyed.
Of course! How can we forget that?
No, we haven't reached yet.
We're on the way.
-Who was that?
-It was from their side.
It's hurting.
Does it hurt, you fucker?
-What did you say?
-Yeah, fucker.
What's there?!
-Rajan! What's this?
-Come here, you!
-Rajesh! Biju!
-What are you doing?
-Stay calm! Stop it! Biju!
-Come here, you!
What the hell…
-Let him go! Leave him!
-To hell with these dumbheads…
-Shut up, you!
-Shall I stop the car?
No! Don't stop.
The family is right behind us!
Look at the way they're going!
You too could've gone in it.
They're having a blast!
Hit him! Hit him!
-Will you wreck it all, you blockhead!
-Kill him here.
Are you happy now?
Move aside! Rajesh!
The car is skidding!
Keep calm, Biju!
-Rajesh!
-To hell with these scumbags…
-Have you all lost it?
-Hey, Rajan!
Leave him, Rajesh!
Stop it, you!
Are you nuts?
Listen to me, Rajan! Stop it!
Please listen to me!
-Hit him!
-Vikas! Listen to me!
-No!
-Stop it, losers!
Bloody prick!
Hey! Hey!
Give it a rest, Biju!
Enough! Stop it, Rajan!
Wait till the wedding is over, dimwits!
We've reached the auditorium,
Wazim!
We've reached, losers!
Stop it!
Act your age, Rajan.
Welcome.
Let's meet the father. Come.
Earnest welcome!
Congratulations.
-Hey! Anything wrong?
-No!
Come on, Reji!
What are you waiting for?
Come on, get in.
You were playing music
and having a blast in the car, right?
I'll also join you on the way back!
With love gushed within the soul
With a garland
Strung with dreams
Here arrives the groom
To match the alluring bride
Weaving fantasies in her eyes
With a blooming soul
Decked up in drapes
The bride awaits, blushing
In the fragrant nuptial room
Wazi!
The groom who matches
The luscious bride
A groom who matches the one
The bride saw in her dreams
WAZI!
Oh my mother!
Wazi! Stop it!
Call him and ask him to stop!
Davy!
Hey!
Hey! Can't you understand?
Stop it!
Stop it, Jamshi!
-Come on, move!
-Let's go! Don't be here!
Wanna spray foam on me?!
Will spray it to your ass, you dog!
-What's happening? Do something!
-Don't panic.
-Stop this havoc!
-Sorry! Let me handle this!
What is the matter with you, you swine?!
Reji! Stop it!
I said stop it!
What the hell are you all doing?
Stop Wazim! Ask him to stop!
Beevi… let's go!
I'm not coming.
David! Move everyone aside.
Listen to me, Wazim!
Stop it!
I have settled the score.
Thanks, buddy!
Are you out of your vigor?
Well, almost.
I'm not done yet!
Come on then, buddy!
Go ahead and make my day!
This won't be over by hitting you.
Whom do you want to hit?
This isn't about hitting.
It's different.
We take up all kinds of issues.
Just tell us, Wazim!
It's her engagement,
the day after tomorrow.
What's her stand?
Sathar…
what's her actual stand?
I congratulated her and
she thanked me.
And it didn't sound so good.
Enough! That's enough!
Let's go there and find the rest!
Where's she?
Dubai.
Wow! That's quite close.
Come on, get up! Let's go!
Not just Dubai, we can--
CHAPTER NINE - THE SKIPPED BEAT!
Sir, the bride is not ready.
Why?
The bride won't be ready
until the groom is ready.
The groom is ready, ma'am.
Shall I have a check on him?
Let the groom report it
directly to the committee then!
Wazim…
come on, go for it!
Don't waste time, boy! Go!
Omega has arrived!
-Jamshi.
-Yeah.
Which one do you want to settle first?
Yours or mine?
I think we should settle mine first!
Wahid…
ithnan… talata…
arba'a… hamsa…
-Sitta…
-No! Reji!
Who's this Sitta?
Cool guy!
Who's this man, Sathar?
Reji bro!
-Charge!
-That's a weird name!
Bring it on, boys!
Stop, honey!
My feet hurt!
My love.
To hell with this gown!
I'm also down!
Honey!
Bug off!
Stop following me and leave, Wazim!
