My hands do not
have strength and power
My heart embraces peace and calm
Resigning myself to avoid adversity.
Seeing richness out of the void.
Violence be turned to peace.
There are always guiding fates.
Dynamic or still. Divide or multiple.
Follow fate to go in and out
of the mortal world. Merciless is mercy.
Follow heart and not be aggressive.
Merciless is mercy.
Dynamic or still. Divide or multiple.
Follow fate to go in and out
of the mortal world. Merciless is mercy.
Follow heart and not be aggressive.
Merciless is mercy.
TEMPLE FOR FULLFILLING YOUR WISH
Tian Bao, now that you are
a monk, you must obey the rules.
You mustn't kill or eat meat.
Master, l have never eaten any meat.
You were born to be a monk.
lt's just that my family's
too poor to afford meat.
- I have always wanted to try it.
- What?
- Master.
- This is our new student named Tian Bao.
This is Jun Bao.
He will be your senior.
The Shaolin Temple has very strict rules.
He'll teach you.
You must always obey your senior.
Jun Bao, teach him how
to recite the Book of Buddha.
- Which part, master?
- I thought you onIy knew one part.
I'll teach you everything,
my junior.
l'm taller and older than you.
Why do l have to call you "Senior?"
I don't know. Just do it.
These are Master's wishes.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll only call you
"Senior" in front of others, but when
no one's around and they can't hear you,
you call me "Senior," understand?
- Do you want to be senior or not?
- Sure!
There's no one around,
so call me senior.
Okay, senior.
Good boy.
- Let's study.
- Let's play!
Let's practice the 36 stances
of Shaolin Fist.
"The Hands!"
"Dance of the Phoenix"!
"Behold, the Golden Rooster"!
"The Dragon's Sword"!
Jun Bao, my junior, come here.
Hey, don't call me "Junior"
in front of the others.
They're way over there.
They can't even hear what we're saying.
I guess you're right.
"The Wild Goose Glides Along the Beach."
- "The Leopard Leaps"...
- Wow, if I were given the chance
to try kung fu,
I'd be a whole lot better than that.
We'd have to get permission
from our master.
"The Octagon Transforms Itself."
What did you hit us for, idiot?
What are you two doing
Iooking around here?
I'm senior to you both.
I can hit you any time l like.
Oh no, you can't.
Tian Bao, are you okay?
You can't spy on our secret kung fu!
- Hey, come on, let's go.
- We'll tell our master!
Go ahead. It's no big deal.
My master's senior to yours.
Master, this will keep
the sunshine off your head.
Everything has a life
including the plants.
We mustn't damage the life of another
just for our own gain.
This is too selfish.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Master.
I understand perfectly.
Even if the sun
is burning down on you,
I won't do anything at all.
Master, l want to learn kung fu.
Why do you want to learn?
- To have a heaIthy body!
- To learn to fight!
Be certain that this
is what you really want.
- lt's what we want.
- lt's what I want.
You must use kung fu
only for helping others.
- Do you understand?
- I understand, Master.
- Take that!
- Who's there?
What are you doing?
I'll teach you a good lesson!
Come on, give me a hand!
I'll keep him covered.
Go to hell!
I know who you are!
- How do you know I'm Jun Bao?
- Because you just told me.
TEMPLE FOR THE STUDY OF TAOISM
Real smooth move. This is all your fault.
You're a stupid idiot, you know that?
Well, he said he knew who I was.
How did I know he was lying?
How could you believe him?
Now you see the mess
you've dragged me into?
- l'm really hungry.
- So am l. l'm starving.
- This is really too much.
- Master!
I told you to practice kung fu
to help others.
Instead, you've used it to fight.
You have shamed me!
- Beating a senior student.
- But, Master--
You keep quiet.
I'll teach you a good lesson.
Master is too lenient,
making you kneel for only three hours.
- Confess your transgression!
- Can I have a red bean bun?
A plain bun will be good enough.
After this, you still have
to clean up Luo Han Hall.
This is your fault too.
Master had to give us a punishment,
so now we have to clean Luo Han Hall
by ourselves.
Just think of it as punishment
for the time you burned that rat
and didn't get caught.
"The Fairy Cometh!"
"The Dragon Shows Its Might!"
I'd like to see how you do
your kung fu moves
fighting with a pole now. Can you show me?
It's very simple.
"The Fairy Cometh!"
"The Dragon Shows Its Might!"
"The Invincible Move!"
And this one's called
"Knocking Your Head!"
Hey! Now you're playing
your damn tricks on me again!
You're too slow. Watch your head!
- Jun Bao, well done.
- Tian Bao, you gave in to me.
Master always says we should
help others with our kung fu.
- Who can we help here?
- We can help ourseIves.
I want to be
number one at Shaolin.
- When will l ever achieve that?
- You're being too naive.
You need a lot more skill
and training to be number one.
You have to learn how
to beat the 1 8 Bronze Men.
And then there are the wooden warriors.
Remember that.
Hey, you'd better get up from there!
Don't Iet anyone see.
Don't worry about it.
No one's gonna see me.
Well, I don't care. Don't just sit there.
- Just get off and sit on the ground--
- Hey!
Now look, you messed up
Master's seat!
You're the one messing around with it.
I'll have to tell on you.
What, you think you can
get away with that?
Every blow of the Shaolin Fist
must be forceful.
Each move is a surprise to the enemy.
It must be swift as the wind.
These are the basics of the Shaolin Fist.
You must be steadfast
in every situation.
- What?
- Look!
- What's going on?
- Who did that?
- Why is that?
- I told you before,
it must be infected with termites, right?
Careful, don't eat them in the rice.
To achieve the highest level,
your body must be as hard as steel.
What's that? Is the bed
collapsing now? Calm down.
Go to sleep. We have to practice
iron palms tomorrow.
Watch my sword, Jun Bao!
You need more practice.
Your arm's not strong enough.
Strike first to prevent attack.
So much for practicing.
Look, our clothes are tattered.
The Luo Han monks will laugh at us.
Well, we'll just tell them
that we over-washed them.
I told you we should wash them
ourselves.
- Ours are okay.
- I saved the best for us.
Good morning.
What happened to the others?
I believe that the rats did it.
So many rats
and termites these days.
Go do something about them.
- Where can we find termites and rats?
- We'll say the birds ate them.
Your kung fu is great!
Thank you. It's nothing.
Here you go.
Tian Bao, you're the greatest of us all!
- That's right, you're sure to win.
- You're great too. Enough?
- Yeah.
- Here's the rice.
Oh, yeah! Wow!
Whoa!
Maintain a steady stance!
- Got it!
- You eat first!
He threw rice at me!
Well, I slipped, that's all.
I'm the one who did it.
Go and tell your master.
My master is the judge
of the kung fu contest.
I'll make sure you won't
get promoted to Da Mor HaII.
Let me go!
I swear, I'll beat that guy.
1 2, 1 3--
l did that one. The competition
for promotion into Da Mor Hall
will be soon.
Do you think you'll make it?
I'm not worried. l've practiced.
It's up to fate to decide.
Fate to decide?
l want to make sure
that l'm number one.
That's why I practice so hard.
Hey, how many bricks
have you cracked?
- 1 7.
- 1 8!
Have you practiced cracking bricks
on the back of your head?
No, I haven't.
Their movements are different.
Buddhist Palm!
The key is in how you breathe.
Today, we are going to decide
who is going to be promoted.
The four best will be
promoted to Da Mor Hall
to further their studies
of advanced martial arts techniques.
Remember, the purpose of kung fu
and practice is to help people.
Contestants must restrain themselves
during the contest.
Now, is that clear?
The first round-- Tian Bao...
and Xin Bao!
I'll teach him a lesson.
Greetings and respect.
Begin!
Try this one!
Xin Bao, you'll lose.
Try my fist!
You cheated!
Enough!
Strike me? How dare you?
I'm sorry, Master.
You are not fit to practice kung fu
due to your ferocious intent.
Therefore, you are expelled.
No, Master.
Sir, it was Xin Bao who cheated.
Are you saying I'm unfair?
- No, Master.
- Are you blind?
- You saw what he did!
- You insult a master?
- He didn't mean it!
- Away!
- l'll destroy your skill.
- Master, please, don't!
Stay away!
Buddhist Palm!
How do you know about Buddhist Palm?
You are blind, aren't you?
l learned it from you!
Tian Bao!
He just snuck a little look.
I want these two detained, now.
Luo Han Poles!
Yes sir!
AII right, guys. We're aII brothers here.
Let's talk this over. Now what?
The Buddha has come.
Surrender, all ye devils!
Tian Bao, break the formation
with their own poles!
Right! I'll break them up!
Try as you might,
you'll never escape from here.
Look out!
- Keep the formation!
- lt's too slippery!
Invincible Move!
Hey, we're aII brothers here.
Let's talk this over.
Hey, wait up!
Don't let them get away!
- Master!
- Get out!
Junior.
You defend your students
when they have done wrong?
So what are you going to tell the Abbot?
It was unfair.
Everyone saw that bastard cheat.
And when I tried to defend myself,
I was the villain.
What did I do wrong?
- To top it off, they were trying to kiII us.
- What is Master up to now?
Right or wrong,
who can ever teII?
Master, we were wrong.
Fate has decreed that we must part.
I cannot be your master anymore.
Go into the outside world
and try to learn from it.
The roots of trouble
are also the roots of Buddhism.
Jun Bao, you have a kind heart.
I don't worry for you.
Tian Bao, you are aggressive.
This book doesn't deal
with any martial arts skill.
But when your heart is restless,
it will bring you peace.
It deals with the flow of chi,
the life force.
Practice it often, and remember...
keep your mind and heart
always at peace.
A temple is not the only place to study.
Now go.
Yes, Master, we're going now.
They're so pretty!
Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up and gather 'round.
- What school do they belong to?
- They're only entertainers.
- Why do they have such strange haircuts?
- l think they're from Khitan.
Well, I'm really hungry.
Me too! We'll beg for alms.
No one pays any attention to us.
Are they all that poor?
No, we have to try harder.
Hey, l'll bet that girl
won't turn us down.
lf she had money,
she wouldn't perform on the streets.
Let's go try these guys over here.
May you all live long
and prosper, gentlemen.
You stupid monks!
No wonder l've had bad luck all day.
May you live long and prosper, gentlemen.
Don't say that. You should say
he will win each bet.
- Cut the crap!
- Whoa!
- l'm sorry. Sorry.
- That's all right.
Excuse me, Brother, but do you
know somebody named Murong Bai?
No, sorry.
Thank you anyway.
She's looking for someone.
We're looking for food.
What we need is a job
so we don't have to beg for money.
- Let's go.
- I'd rather go back to the temple.
- Pay your protection!
- I've paid you all l can.
Well, maybe that's just not enough.
- Pay or die! It's your choice.
- But really, l have no more money!
Don't beat me--
He should pay. Beat him up.
I'll report you to the police!
Don't you know I'm the governor's cousin?
- Hey, little lady.
- Buzz off!
You want to go for a drink with me?
How about it?
Oh, she's too shy.
Oh, God, no.
Here, friend, take this cash.
- It belongs to that jerk.
- Thank you so much.
Huh? My money!
- The girl took it!
- I've gotta go now.
Get her!
- Performers?
- No, fighting.
They're ganging up on her.
- Should we help her?
- Of course.
Hey, don't hit her, hit me.
With pleasure!
You hit me first.
Miss, are you all right?
Is something wrong?
The 1 5th move! The 1 6th move!
- There. l'm okay now.
- The 1 7th move!
The 1 8th move!
The 20th move!
The 35th move!
The 36th move!
36 moves! Are you done?
Just one more. . . I made it up!
- Will you...
- Won't you ever do that move
like I taught you?
Master Liu, who did this?
Run quick, the troops are here!
- Arrest those monks!
- Let's go!
They went that way! After them!
Yes!
Paper, rock, scissors.
Paper, rock, scissors.
Paper, rock, scissors.
Paper, rock, scissors--
- You look like you're from Khitan.
- You too!
What game were you playing?
It's one we made up
when we were kids.
Teach it to me.
The winner was senior.
The loser was junior.
But he always won.
It's simple. You were too slow.
You must have been cheating in that case.
If you play against me,
I'II be your godmother.
Godmother?
Governor Liu comes to pay
respects to the Buddha.
Clear the way!
Wow! How privileged!
Why is a Buddhist so cruel?
He's Liu Jin, the royal eunuch.
He's Iike a snake inside.
He's killed fewer people than usual today.
I wish I could be as privileged as he is.
Then just become a eunuch.
Why not?
Eighth Master, you're early today.
BUDDHA'S LAUGH RESTAURANT
I'll prepare some nice dishes for you.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you.
Mister, there's a dark mist
on your forehead.
Piss off! I'm eating.
Lady, there's a dark mist
on your forehead. I know your fortune.
Are you looking for someone?
Finding them may not be good.
- Would you like to buy a charm?
- Con man.
You don't have to take it.
The most famous dish here
is roast pigeon.
What? Don't they
have vegetarian food here?
- The rice is okay.
- Hey, Jun Bao,
we must adapt ourseIves.
Remember what the master said--
we must discover
the spirit of Buddhism
in the secular world.
Hey, I will try if first.
Hmm.
Here, have some bean curd.
Otherwise you have nothing to eat.
Thank you.
You too.
Right this way, my lady.
We've reserved your table for you.
My dear, what wish
did Master make at the shrine?
That's none of your business.
Yes, dear.
- Please.
- Please.
- What would you like to eat, dear?
- Oh, anything.
- All right.
- Murong Bai?
Is it really you?
- Qiu Xue, what are you doing here?
- Quiet!
AII this way to find your husband.
How touching!
Too bad his name's no longer Murong,
but Liu after my family.
He would've starved to death
if I hadn't deigned to save him.
Men have no shame
and they're so predictable.
They'II aIways stay beside you.
They will never stray
if you keep them warm and happy.
Don't you find that to be true?
Qiu Xue, go home.
That man has no heart.
Murong Bai,
you're no longer a man.
You've become a dog.
l used to play
this instrument every night.
I would never sell it
for the money I needed.
Now, everything has changed.
Take it back.
Garbage.
I think you need it more than l do.
Do you know who l am?
She's Governor Liu's sister.
Don't get involved.
That's enough.
I don't want to have to hurt you.
- Are you all right, dear?
- You dog!
Just go away. I'm through with you!
What are you staring at? Piss off.
Now, go!
Do you hear? Go on.
Go on!
I'll help you!
Lady, you're bleeding.
I'm sorry.
Wait, I can't touch her.
Stand up!
Oh, God!
Shameless cur!
Don't worry, I'm here.
Who's fighting in here? Nobody move!
- Hold it!
- The troops are here!
Quick, let's go!
Why are the troops always after us?
Don't let those Khitans go!
Yes, my lady!
FoIIow me!
Hurry! The troops are gaining!
- Come on, quick!
- Go to hell!
Heavy load.
Of course it's heavy. She's a woman.
Oh, Buddha forgive me for being lustful.
Are you okay?
- Come on, get 'em!
- Hurry up!
Hurry it up! Come on!
Where'd they go?
- Back at the restaurant?
- Oh, yeah.
- Why did we come back here?
- Well--
- Maybe it's another branch.
- Oh, no.
This is the only restaurant in town.
WeII, you two go ahead
and sleep on the floor.
I'll take care of her. Go on.
I felt better being a monk.
Jun Bao, you can't go on relying on others
like that guy Murong Bai.
We won't rely on others.
We can go to work for the restaurant.
We can only stay here the night.
They're not gonna let us
stay here forever.
I'll be an official one day.
Well, it doesn't matter to me what you are
as long as you're honest
in what you do
and trust your fate to guide you right.
Hey, let's go to sleep now.
My fate.
I swear that l'll be rich
and powerful someday.
Governor Liu would never imagine
that his bribe money
would be stoIen back from him.
- Hey.
- We should give it back
to those who lost it. It's obvious we shouId
give it back to the poor.
- That's right.
- He's collecting this tax money
from the people. So long as he lives,
we'll keep stealing it back!
These people are underground rebels.
It's none of our business.
Let's get out of here.
I can't pretend I didn't hear
what I overheard.
Never mind. Go to sleep.
Look, another masked thief.
How dare he steal from Governor Liu?
The more, the better!
They're offering more rewards to
catch them than yesterday.
Wow, they're worth
500 teals of gold a piece.
That restaurant--
Mind your own business.
- Delicious buns.
- Yeah.
- Human meat bun
-What? Human meat bun!?
May l have your attention?
What are you going to perform then,
lifting heavy weights?
No, I'm a living sandbag,
like a human meat bun.
- What's that?
- Well...
one cent will allow you one punch.
- What do we gain from that?
- Right, what do they gain?
If your punch makes me yell in pain,
I'll give you three cents!
- And if they make you throw up blood?
- lf anybody can make me do that,
- l'll pay you six!
- And what if l kill ya?
Well, in that case--
you'll have my life, that's what.
- Wow!
- That's 50% at least.
Right. That's 50 punches.
Well, that's' all.
Would you like to continue, sir?
- Here.
- Go on.
I'll kill you!
46, 47,
48...
- Tian Bao, are you aIright?
- l'm only pretending,
so we can string them aIong. I'm okay.
Hey, mister, he's faIIing apart.
He's aImost finished.
Go on, now.
Don't you want to beat him?
Where are my servants?
Beat them to death!
I'll pay you all!
What an easy way
to earn money, huh?
Yeah, well, I want to get rich.
Well, all l want is
to have enough to eat.
I want to buy a house and be a boss.
That'd be a lot of punches.
Give me the money.
- But why?
- For a tax.
50 cents for profits tax,
another 50 for using government Iand,
50 cents for entertainment tax,
and that's a total of 1 50 cents.
- We won't pay.
- Wait.
Tax evasion, huh?
Think twice before you do that.
I shall arrest you.
Good sir, we're just common folk.
Heaven and earth as our witness,
we wouldn't argue with you.
Here, we'II pay you.
You're a smart one.
Thank you, sir. The fact is,
we're new around here.
Only thing we know how to do is fight.
We want to work for you, sir.
Then fight against yourself.
Do it now.
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!
Thank you, sir!
This is my pleasure, sir.
You really are a smart one.
The Royal Eunuch Governor Liu
is recruiting now.
AII right. Follow me.
Thank you, sir. Jun Bao, let's go.
You're really going?
I'm not going.
When l'm an official, I'll come find you.
Tian Bao!
Take care of yourself.
I wish you good luck.
You shouId not trash yourself like that.
Hey, don't drink anymore.
Just forget it.
Little Melon, there are some things
you can never forget.
You're so young,
you wouldn't understand.
Is Tian Bao with you?
Look at me, dear.
You still want a man?
I didn't say that I liked him.
I can see right through you.
Drink up, now.
Hey, this is wine, not tea.
No one can drink like this and live.
AII right, that's enough.
Hey, give that back to me! Hey!
- Sorry.
- Hey, kid.
Everyone should enjoy their life.
She's okay and you're okay,
so here's to ya.
Yeah, well, I don't need your advice.
Stop drinking!
What's wrong with you?
You'll kill yourself!
Mind your own business!
- No!
- Hey, leave him alone.
He'Il stop when he's tired.
Even I can't leave him alone.
- I still have wine here.
- Who should we heIp?
- Stop it!
- l don't care!
Go ahead, go on. Do another.
That's right, do them all.
Then there won't be any wine left.
Will you please calm down?
Zhang Jun Bao, just let go of me.
Stop this!
Wow, you--
Will you calm down?
The past creates who you are.
It shouldn't be your burden.
lf you go on like this,
you'll only be hurting yourself.
BUDDHA'S LAUGH RESTAURANT
Hey, what's with the ball?
I'm trying to understand the Tao.
Everything is round in nature--
the sun is round
and so is the moon.
So watch and learn how
to be round and smooth.
Who's in charge here?
Show your face.
Sirs, you're early. We haven't
opened for business yet,
but you're welcome to join us.
Your taxes-- pay now.
We paid a few days ago.
You ate a few days ago too,
isn't that true?
The army's being expanded.
You have to pay a uniform tax,
an arms manufacturing tax,
and this restaurant has to pay 500 teals.
Well, that's extortion, that is.
- You're not a rebeI activist, are you?
- The government shouId be reasonable.
- Easy, easy, take it easy.
- Just be patient now.
Whoever has a sword in his hand
can raise his voice.
Now, eat this.
- Be strong.
- lf you don't,
I'll arrest everyone.
Your face sure Iooks stupid.
No, you mustn't.
It's just much too dangerous.
Have no money? All right.
Then just bow to me 30 times
and I'll consider granting you an exemption.
Go on. Bow down.
Do it! Kneel!
You think you're tough, do you?
lf you don't kneel, that means
you're a rebel and l'll execute you!
This is too much! Go to hell!
You eat this and bow down!
You rebels, I'll kill you all.
Attack!
They can't leave! Shut the doors
and windows to keep them in!
What sins we have committed here.
Blacksmith, you go
get rid of the corpses, okay?
Don't let him get away!
We'll be dead if he tells the others!
Wait, something's not right here.
Hey, we're both vegetarians.
Do me a favor and let's get going!
Shit. He's almost reached his camp.
Come on, hurry up, will ya?
Whoa.
- What happened, sir?
- Rebels at the restaurant.
I'll report to Master Liu.
Here comes one now, you stop him.
I'll handle it.
I killed him for you.
Those people
at the restaurant aren't good.
You mustn't go around with them.
I think they're pretty nice.
You're a criminal and l'm a soldier.
We're on opposite sides.
Nah. Oh, hey, now that you're a soldier
how's your life in the barracks?
You know me,
I always could take care of myself.
- And you?
- Well, I think l like the old days.
We were so carefree.
If I could only have a red bean bun now.
That's what I would like.
Jun Bao, don't think of the past.
Look to the future.
That's the reality.
And one day I'll have it all.
Tian Bao, can you give me
any pointers on riding this horse?
It's real easy.
Hey, that's too fast!
I am the master of my own destiny.
The purpose of today's contest
is to choose from among
the best combatants
the person with the best martial arts
skill to be general.
Now let the contest begin.
Master, this is too easy.
So to dispel any doubts,
I invite anyone to come challenge me.
Master, Tian Bao here to serve you.
With pleasure.
Very vicious.
I'll warn him, Master.
Master.
Dismissed.
You went too far.
Not worthy of a soldier.
By your actions,
you've brought shame to me.
The first rule in the army
is that you mustn't offend the majority.
Luckily, the governor is lenient.
Wait, sir. Sir, I know l did wrong.
I just wanted to advance.
Give me another chance.
I'll show you what I can do!
I'll wait to see how you perform.
Ah, Qiu Xue, I know what you could do
here. You could be a bartender.
Okay. Where there's wine,
you won't find me too far away.
And Jun Bao can earn his keep
by being a waiter.
- Mm, yeah!
- Mmn!
- And you can clean the toilet.
- Sure, no probIem.
- And will you wash my undercIothes?
- Sure.
I don't even know if
you have ever washed your underpants.
- You've never washed your underpants?
- What's so funny?
Tian Bao, what are you doing back here?
You must go. Get out of here!
They found out everything--
all the taxes you stole and the kiIIings.
The troops are on their way.
They're going to arrest you.
We've got to get going right away.
You go on ahead.
I'll destroy the evidence.
- You follow quickly!
- Go on!
- Go and arrest them!
- Yes, sir!
No!
- Did you kill my tax officer?
- Yes, l did.
And I'll kill you, you impudent tyrant!
May you rest in piece, boss.
Bless us, there in heaven.
"Heaven?"
We must avenge the boss!
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm ready to storm the barracks
and kill the governor.
Hey, we need a plan.
Don't be in such a rush.
He killed them all last time
without a plan.
We can't fight the whole army,
but there must be something we can do.
There is strength in numbers.
You must know
the other rebel organizations.
lf you contact them,
you could join forces.
I'll organize it.
Good. I'II work on the inside.
Day after tomorrow, most of the army
will be out on maneuvers.
That would be the perfect time.
We'll get right to Liu.
You join with the others
and we'll destroy the governor.
- All right!
- Good.
We'll go and kill them all.
- Great!
- All right. We'd better get ready.
- All right.
- Tian Bao.
Take care.
Get down!
That way.
Who's there?
Oh, sorry.
I just had to take a piss back there.
Well, okay. All right, men. Let's go.
AII right.
Well, that was close. I gotta piss.
It's all right. I'll hold on.
Where's Governor Liu?
He's in that tent with just a few guards.
- This is our chance.
- Right.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Where is Tian Bao?
Kill.
Come on, lads, kill him!
Five so far!
Oh, what a tragedy!
Life is for living. To live is to die.
To die is to live.
Tian Bao.
Gotta do something.
Blacksmith!
Who betrayed us?
Blacksmith, hang on!
Who betrayed us?
Who betrayed us?!
Tian Bao.
Let's go!
- Qiu Xue!
- Jun Bao, come on!
I overestimated the strength
of those miserable rebels.
Nevertheless, I must admit
that your clever setup
did save me a lot of trouble.
I'm loyal to you, Master.
You betrayed your friends.
What's to say you won't
betray me in the future?
My whole career depends on you.
Would l destroy my own career?
WeII, then I should have promoted you
to general last time, Tian Bao,
but you were only a soldier.
Your promotion would have caused
jealousy among your fellow soldiers.
But from now on,
you shall be Royal Lieutenant.
Thank you, Master.
The one who escaped
has great martial arts skill.
I need the best people.
Recruit him if you can
and we'll work together
for his majesty the Emperor.
If you can't, then destroy him.
Get up. Let me carry you.
You are a traitor.
You lured them aII to their deaths!
They took you in when you
were poor and in need.
Oh, my brothers,
how you have died!
It's your fault, you bastard!
I'll kill you!
No! Don't!
He doesn't feel any better
about this than you do!
He was betrayed by the one
he trusted the most.
We mustn't blame him!
I don't give a damn how he feels.
It's still his fault!
Let's go!
Jun Bao.
I'll go save the survivors myself!
I know you're angry,
but I just wanted to save you.
Those rebels would have
met their fate sooner or later.
The most important thing is
we'll always be together now.
I thought that you were a ruthless
and ambitious person.
l didn't realize that
you couldn't handle a woman.
Master, I was too impulsive.
Forgive me.
I'll kill you!
How can you keep a rebel
in your quarters?
Are you an officer or not?
I am successful because
I have no need of women.
lf women aren't for you,
then they won't be for me either, sir.
I didn't ask you to kill her,
but you were smart!
Thank you, Master.
Jun Bao, I've opened the door
to great wealth.
You just have to come in.
I don't want your wealth. Release her!
We've known each other for 20 years!
Isn't it a fact that we always
shared everything?
Master Liu will promote us.
I've created a lot of opportunity.
Let us work together and we'll be great men.
Tian Bao, I don't know
who you are any Ionger.
I don't want to know anyone
who would choose wealth over his friends.
What do you know about that?!
Those rebels deserved
everything they got.
They died because l trusted you.
Now release the one remaining.
Anyone who tries to go against me
has chosen a fate of death.
- Attack!
- Sir!
I'll ask you one more time.
I'm inviting you to join me.
I will never join with the likes of you.
Jun Bao, I don't want to have to kill you!
You have made
this situation what it is.
Jun Bao, your kung fu is inferior.
- I fight for all the innocents you killed.
- Is that so?
You shouId know I kiIIed Little Melon too!
I strike, Jun Bao!
I'll teach you!
Strike before the enemy!
Jun Bao!
Put this on his wound.
It's very effective.
Hold on. This could hurt.
Why doesn't he seem to feel anything?
I'll see.
No feeling at all! Ow!
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, it hurts!
Hold on.
WeII now, what do you think about this?
He's received
the worst shock of his life.
He was betrayed
by the one he most trusted.
Because of that,
many good people were killed.
This accounts for his behavior.
Will he recover?
Well, maybe, in a couple of days.
You're a sacred man.
You know what happened to Tian Bao.
You shake your head and you sigh.
You are an admirable gentleman.
Then again, it might take
two or three years for him to recover.
An admirable man.
- No! I didn't betray you!
- lt's all right!
- lt's all my fault!
- Calm down. lt's only a dream!
It's all right!
But it's true.
It's all true.
They were sitting right there, our friends.
- There--
- Have some wine. A little.
A IittIe?
I know I made you all worry about me.
But l just couldn't help myself.
Sorry.
So sorry.
Hey, do you think this will work?
It's worth a try.
lf we can stimulate
the right meridian points...
Jun Bao?
- Brother?
- What?
Now trust me, this'll be good for you.
- Yeah, good for you.
- I don't want anything good.
You take it!
That's all right, you don't have to cry.
But he got me
on my crying nerve points.
Look, he got you too...
on your laughing nerve points.
You're a pile of shit!
He Kun, did you train these men?
I can't believe you're so inept.
You needn't insult me
and my training technique.
The way you abuse the men,
mark my words, they'll rebel one day.
These are soldiers.
Only the best will be able to survive.
And that goes for you too.
Tian Bao, you may
control the army now,
but you should remember I'm the one
who gave you your chance.
Sentimentality!
He Kun, we don't have any friendship.
I'll put a stop to your arrogance.
I'll go see Governor Liu.
Those who disobey must die.
Now continue.
- Jun Bao?
- Jun Bao?
- Now where is he? Jun Bao?
- Where could he hide?
Huh? Jun Bao!
Shh.
Stay cool. Stay cool.
You stay cool!
Jun Bao, you look like shit!
You must be carefuI of your wounds.
I wasn't hurt.
Huh?
Now you two need to get cool.
Get out of there.
Oh, that hurts.
A good sign of recovery.
Master?
My master, I'm scared.
I don't want to learn kung fu.
I don't want to fight.
- I just want a red bean bun.
- Let's see what he's doing.
Master, you've lost weight
and grown taller.
A few more wrinkIes.
You're still a handsome man, though.
Jun Bao, come on.
It's just a wooden pole.
It is not your master.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yep.
See?
What? You say you're okay?
No problem.
I just gotta get him to take a rest.
Here.
Go to sleep. Take a rest.
Go to sleep. Take a rest!
The sheet's too small.
How can I sleep?
- Is it going to work?
- Well, it'd better work.
If it doesn't work,
I'll slap myself 1 0 times.
Try to rest.
And you'II recover soon.
Oh my God, l deserve this!
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
- seven, eight, nine, 1 0.
- You helped me when I was hurting.
- Now l'm going to help you.
- And 1 0 times more. Ow!
- We mustn't let down the Lieutenant!
- Yes!
Whoever doesn't try his hardest...
is going to suffer!
Ready, and start!
Yes!
ln order to practice kung fu,
you must have a body as hard as steel!
Keep going! Don't stop!
Zhang Jun Bao,
you killed those people.
It's your fault. You did it.
You did. You deserve to die.
You did it! You did it! It's your fauIt!
- You should die!
- Ow!
- He almost killed me.
- He does this almost every morning.
Do you understand?
What's that?
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Oh, now l get it.
And he's Iike this at noon.
And in the evening he's bad too.
He gets crazy like that three times a day.
He should not be called Jun Bao
but San Feng
(Thrice crazy)!
Huh?
Jun Bao, time to eat.
You haven't eaten for days now.
Hey, you eat rice with your mouth
and not with your nose.
Eat it!
Crazy again?
Right on schedule, San Feng.
Lord Master Liu,
these are the rebels I have arrested
and the taxes l've collected.
You have done my job for me.
l have nothing to do.
I am learning from you, Master.
It's a joy to serve you.
l simply want to make
your duties easier for you.
AII across the entire country
there are rebellions that have erupted,
except in my province.
And the tax returns are very high.
His highness has asked me
to report to the royal court.
We'll be loyaI to you
whiIe you're away
to repay all the kindness
you have given to us.
The other officials should take
a lesson from you.
Why don't you come with me there?
We'll see the emperor.
Thank you, Master.
But until that time, I do not want to hear
of any rebeIIion in my province
or of any discontent in my court!
Yes, Master!
We wish all the best of luck
to our beloved Lieutenant.
Jun Bao, don't do that. It's very dirty.
Here, this water's cIean.
Oh, very good.
My hands are dirty from too much killing.
- Thanks.
- Jun Bao, don't do that.
Come on, stop it now.
Oh, l get it.
I'll wash my face.
- No, Jun Bao, no!
- Let me wash...
WaIking out in the sunshine
and fresh air will help you.
I hope you don't get a sunburn.
Look around. Everything in nature
has its true purpose.
This tree has withered and died,
and yet new life continues on it.
You could be Iike that.
Brother! Brother!
- What is it?
- Sister-in-law has just given birth!
- Hurry home now!
- Really?
Yes, let's go!
What shall we call the baby?
That load of firewood is too heavy.
Your child is waiting for you.
Now put down that firewood
or you are too greedy.
- You're right. Hurry!
- Hey, wait for me!
Lower your burden.
- Run towards new life.
- Right.
I hope that he gets home quickly.
Lower your burden.
Run towards new life.
Lower your burden.
Run towards new life.
Lower your burden.
Run towards new life!
This is the book of the chi life energy,
not a manual of martial arts.
When you are confused,
it can bring you peace.
This book of the chi is so refined
that it teaches to avoid
killing the enemy,
but make best use
of every opportunity.
Gather together, but don't use force.
Force wiII not break it.
But how can l break it without force?
No fancy tricks or the flow will cease.
The air current
should match the universe.
No desire. No lust.
What else have you learned
from that book?!
No immovable roots. No stirring of dust.
Only the way of nature.
This is called Tai Chi.
Hey, I'm aII right now.
It's just that l feel a little sad.
Hey, your past creates who you are.
It shouldn't become your burden.
Come eat, Jun Bao.
You've just recovered,
so you shouId eat plenty.
- Don't go crazy now. San Feng.
- Hey!
San Fong? Zhang San Fong?
That's not much of a choice.
Right.
Jun Bao, forget the past.
Why doesn't this lie down?
It's not sleepy yet, that's all.
Come on. Stop fooling around.
WeII, there's a piece of iron
in the bottom of it.
Breathing like nature.
Universal wind.
Keep your center of gravity
and utilize the attacker's force.
A spinning ball
repels other objects it touches,
yet itself stands steady and firm.
Damned ball ruined dinner!
- Shit!
- Hey!
Even in movement,
there is always stillness.
He's understanding something.
No matter how hard l push,
the water springs it back.
The stronger you are,
the stronger your opponent.
I can't even defeat still water.
Jun Bao, how are you?
Have you gone crazy again?
I finally understand what is natural.
Everything's in nature.
I look that bad now?
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Come on, out!
Come on, get out.
Kneel!
Where's Zhang Jun Bao?
I think you know.
Who? Who is Zhang Jun Bao?
Kill his wife!
Kill his daughter if he won't talk.
No, don't kill her! She's innocent.
Kill!
You are a kiIIer!
You are a ruthIess murderer!
You're nothing.
Whoever defends Zhang Jun Bao
declares he's an enemy of mine
and will die like him!
- Brother Ling!
- Brother Ling!
- Brother Ling!
- What is it?
Tian Bao is getting crazier.
He's more ruthIess than Governor Liu.
He killed the grocer
and his whole family
- right in the street!
- Yeah, that's right.
He said he's gonna kill
even more people
if we don't tell him where you are.
Take care of yourselves. We're going.
And you take care as well.
Taoism teaches us
to avoid disaster. Let's go.
Taoism also teaches us
to help other people.
You should know the importance
of doing nothing.
If you have a heart,
how can you do nothing?
In order to avoid the deaths
of more innocents
I must stop him by doing
anything that l can.
But what if something happens to you?
If so, it's fate.
Then I'll go with you.
I think you had better stay.
I know. I'd only get in the way.
These good-luck charms
don't usually work,
but I hope they do now.
I've studied Taoism all my life
and I still don't get it,
but you realize its truth in an instant.
You'll be a master of masters.
l'm gonna retire.
Congratulations on your invitation
to the palace.
I'm sure you'll have a Iong life
and great wealth.
Rebels.
Why have you come here?
Do you want to die?
We've come to deliver that fate to you.
You cannot escape from it anymore.
God is benevolent.
Why fight with swords and spears?
Don't kill me. Please don't.
I won't kiII you. You have a job to do.
Get up.
- Keep away!
- Be careful! Master Liu!
Get back!
Jun Bao, you're clever
taking Master Liu as hostage.
I've been clever all my life,
but l would never empIoy
such tactics just to be cIever.
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you what I want.
You're on an evil path
and I want to stop you.
Don't you realize?
You've always been inferior to me
in your martial arts and your strategy.
I will stop you.
Tell him to kneel.
Kneel down.
Kneel.
You're on your knees in front of me now.
How will you defeat me?
Jun Bao, you like to help people, right?
I earned my power with a lot of effort.
I won't give it up.
Why don't you just do me a favor?
Why not release Governor Liu?
Wealth and fame are temporary.
I am acting for heaven.
I'm god in my own heaven.
- What fighting style is that?
- Nature is the origin
of everything.
Tai Chi!
Jun Bao, I'll never aIIow myseIf
to be defeated by you!
You're obsessed with lust
and with desire.
I'll beat you.
Jun Bao, if you can't stand firm,
how can you attack?
Use the attacker's force to strike!
Attack! Kill him!
- Attack!
- No one move!
Stay where you are!
Kill anyone who moves.
Attack! Why don't you attack?
No, you hold it!
Of course. Of course.
- Why don't you attack?
- Master Liu said not to!
Tian Bao, if I lose a single hair,
I'II see that you lose your head!
- Master Liu!
- Master Liu!
Master Liu is dead now!
I'm the leader! Attack!
He's kiIIed your leader!
He will kill all of you too.
- You'll obey him?!
- Back!
Move back.
Everyone's deserted you.
No one's going to help you now.
Help me, you fools!
- Going against me?!
- You deserve it!
- Yes, you deserve it!
- You don't treat us like human beings!
We'd be afraid of what you'd do
when you were finished!
That's right!
Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him.
Please forgive me before l die.
I wronged you.
Jun Bao.
Think of our times together.
Please forgive me.
You always defended me
when we were small.
Don't trust him.
Go to hell!
Kill him! Kill him!
You all can go now.
So where will you go?
I'll take Tian Bao's ashes to our master.
I see. Will we see each other again?
Fate wiII tell.
Bye, Zhang San Fong.
