Juggers coming!
Juggers coming!
I saw!
Juggers!
Juggers coming!
They're coming.
They're coming!
One hundred stones, three times.
- Punish him!
- Come on! Back me up here!
Cover him!
Cover the Qwik!
Cover me!
Cover me!
Move up! Get in there!
No, no! Protect him!
Take it away.
Go, go! Home, home!
Get to your feet!
Don't be afraid, Dog Boy.
He has a tattoo!
From the League!
Show them where you come from.
Show them where you going.
Show them where you going, Dog Boy.
That's it!
Get it, Dog Boy!
Get it! Get it!
Hold him!
Hold him, Dog Boy!
Do not let him go.
98... Hold on, Dog Boy!
That's it! Hundred stones!
One hundred stones, done!
I thought... I thought these
ones were supposed to be easy.
You're playing like old women.
You think you can last
15 or 20 stones?
Not if that kid doesn't put
his metal up.
I tripped.
It is supposed to protect me.
I lost my grip.
You better get it right.
You do not want to play
with this bunch.
Very bad.
Especially that one,
with the tattoo on his head.
He too good.
He must have played in the League.
I want you to put a pin on the Slash.
Keep him outta my way.
I can't put him down.
I'll put him down.
You just sit on him.
This is stupid.  We should be
fucking and drinking by now.
20 stone, no more.
They got a new Qwik.
How's your leg?
That hurts?
I'm gonna rip your tits off, bitch.
I'm gonna hurt your leg.
I'm gonna break your leg.
- Big! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!
- Pin! Come on!
- Sit still!
Sallow, get her!
Take it, Dog Boy.
Take it home, Dog Boy!
If you move a little faster,
you wouldn't need all that sewing.
Pretty soon you'll be all thread.
If it was white thread...
Why are you doing this, Kidda?
They hurt you.
I don't care.
I hurt them too.
They hurt you more, kick you.
The one from the League kicked me.
The man from the city.
The good one...
I could be good like that.
Iâ€™m going away, mama.
Life is hard everywhere.
I'm good. I can win.
Win what?
Everything.
Your Qwik...
He's ruined.
He can't run anymore.
Spoiled!
I got speed, I can run.
I'll Qwik for you.
He'll heal. He always does.
Dog shit.
He's a good Qwik... Dog Boy.
So, he hit little Gar,
very hard, indeed.
Wacked him on the head,
so the Qwik can make a good run.
But the poor Qwik was so dizzy
from blow from Quincy,
that he forgot the skull
and went clear down the run
to the wrong stake!
Or, better one...
This fellow,
a head hunter, made a bet.
And it was a foolish bet.
I can't stand.
Sallow, we'll build a hemlock ...
No!
Nobody carries the Dog Boy.
Just give me some food, Gandhi.
And give me some water.
Give him his share.
Bad fake.
Your eyes gave it away.
Gar!
The Qwik needs a friend.
You're not protecting the Qwik.
Well, you're playing bareheaded.
She's playing bareheaded too.
Don't worry about me.
Can't pass an old man?
I didn't see him.
You gotta know
where everybody is, always.
What if I can't?
They'll crush your skull.
Sprint!
Get her loose!
- Get back!
- Watch left!
If he was in the League,
why is he playing dog wrenches
and market towns now?
That was a long time ago.
Sallow was very young.
How is she?
It's nothing.
- You need more practice.
- I put the skull on, didn't I?
You spent a lot of time
rolling on the ground.
Rolling on the ground?
Will you shut up
and let me sew her?
Can I help?
I want to sew her.
No, no. We need her.
You'll sew her arms together
 or something!
You have some good moves...
Some good running.
Not at all bad.
Just need some practice, that's all.
- He thinks you are good.
- That's not what he said.
It's what he meant.
They made him leave the League
because of a woman?
- A special woman.
- Special?
An elegant lady.
Sallow with a elegant lady?
An elegant lady
wouldn't be with Sallow.
You don't understand.
It's different in the League.
In the League,
you're almost one of them.
Almost. They feed you
 like one of them.
They dress you in special clothing...
And silk.
Silk?
A cloth so fine,
like the wind on your cheek.
They give you your own room.
They treat you like one of them.
But you said they banished him
because he was with an elegant lady.
It was very public.
He wasn't discreet.
He insulted an Overlord.
Her lover.
Sallow was very young.
Tell me more about the silk.
Oh, watch my neck!
Still trying...
I told you, two Juggers
can't fuck after the game.
It doesn't work.
Unless you like rubbing wounds
 against wounds.
The boys in this place look
like they have not eaten in 6 months.
They probably haven't.
We live good compared to most.
So ...
What?
Tell us about the League.
- What about it?
- Are they really so good?
- Yeah.
- Really?
Better than what you imagine.
How do you know
if you're good enough?
You know.
What if you're wrong?
You find out.
Is there really such a thing as silk?
Yes.
You'll play good enough with one eye,
as long as you move you head a lot.
You got to keep swiveling your head
when you play one-eyed.
But we ought to stop
moving north.
The further we go north
the tougher the matches.
Close it up,
so I don't get any dirt in the hole.
- If we headed back to the dog towns...
- We're going north.
Gar said we could play
a team from the League.
Don't be stupid.
He said any team
could make a challenge.
That's how you got noticed.
In the challenge.
That's how they find new Juggers,
he said. By challenges.
It's not just me Gar wants
the attention of the League, too.
- No.
- Why not?
They wouldn't accept challenge.
Now shut up.
Because of you?
Because of what you did?
Sallow! Sallow!
Sallow, Dundee is north,
up the coast!
You're going the wrong way!
Do not be a fool, Sallow.
You can't go to the Red City.
They won't accept the challenge.
I'm not going.
Me either, Sallow.
- They'll break our brains.
- They'll smash our bones.
We'll be back in the dog town
with no legs.
So what? We've been hurt
before. We can take it.
- Shut up.
- We're about the best!
What do you know about
the League, boy?
If they want the attention
of the League,
let them find a younger bunch.
You're not coming?
No.
You?
No.
We can't challenge without them.
We'll find the Drive and a Back-Charge
in one of the dog towns.
You going too?
They won't break my bones.
It's just another dog town for me.
Let's go. It's five day walk.
That fool...
He's one eye from blind now!
Gandhi said that no League team
has ever been beaten in a challenge.
You think we can do it?
Do what?
Win.
Win?
Or at least go a hundred stones
 three times.
That would be just as good.
300 stones. A tie.
How many stones did you go
when you made your challenge?
26.
26 stones?
That's all? 26 stones?
And you received
the attention of the League?
We were the only ones
who ever lasted that long.
Two of us were still standing.
It was a good game.
We played very well.
How deep do we go?
Very deep.
We can't win this?
In the Red City?
It's impossible?
You gotta try.
You're just trying to scare me.
It's impossible?
I'm not afraid.
They may not accept
the challenge, anyway.
Sallow, I'm hungry.
Gandhi... you better get
something to eat.
Six pies, over here.
Where are you going?
- Five, over here.
- Where is he going?
Five.
He's going to the Juggers, isn't he?
I'm going with him.
Wait!
No, I ordered four.
Only four, not six.
This is a mistake. Four.
I can't see. I can't see!
- Here they come.
- Bravo!
- Red City!
- Well played.
Bravo. Fine moves.
Well played.
Well played.
You were at top form.
Gonzo, the Slash... Bravo.
Gonzo!
Who wants to know?
You could have won in 20.
You look like shit.
I didn't see your Griffer.
- Busted his neck.
- You take care of him?
The League? Always takes
good care of us, you know.
I want a challenge.
This is my Qwik.
I'll never accept,
not with you.
Still remembers me.
Get out of the Red City.
Old burns don't heal
like young burns.
I thought we were the same age,
you and me.
We used to be.
Don't tell him I'm here.
Sallow! You got one eye
and two good legs.
It's bad enough at top...
but don't fuck with the Nine Cities.
Maybe I was wrong.
About what?
About wanting
the attention of the League.
Afraid?
Yes.
But this is not it.
Go get the others.
He's right, your friend.
Your eye...
You can't play against them now.
Do as I tell you.
I do not want the attention
of the League. Not now.
But I do.
We'll look these over
before we decide.
Next.
So they recognized you...
and they didn't accept
 the challenge.
If it was not for him ...
What a fool.
He was in the League,
he had everything!
What a stupid fool...
For some woman.
He was young, very young.
He was an idiot!
Plenty of challengers.
You can join a different bunch.
You were right about
how good they are.
I never dreamed it could be played
so fast and so hard.
I used to belong here.
When I said I was afraid,
I didn't mean
I wouldn't have played.
I know.
- Two.
- Just get one.
We'll share it.
You'll save money.
Thank you.
Is this were you slept
when you were in the League?
No.
I didn't think so.
You slept... in silk.
With women with no scars.
Sometimes.
It should be soft,
skin with no scars.
Like silk.
I like scars.
A superior effort today.
Thank you, my Lord.
The stratageme on the 36th stone.
Thank you, my Lord.
I regret we went 36 stones,
we should have done it in 20.
No doubt tomorrow it will be shorter.
Tomorrow, my Lord?
Challenge.
Oh... The challenges.
I leave that to the young ones, my Lord.
I'm too old to learn anything
from games like that.
Tomorrow is different, Gonzo.
I'm playing against challengers?
Against your old friend, Sallow.
Sallow?
He made a challenge.
And it was accepted?
at my insistence.
I see.
I don't imagine that he's
much good anymore...
Now that he's down to one eye.
Is that so?
One eye from night,
as they say.
He could lose that other eye easily
enough, it's such a rough sport.
What?
Break his legs too,
for good measure.
You want me to damage him
on purpose?
My dear.
You know Gonzo, of course...
The best Slash of all
in the Nine Cities.
- On purpose?
- I insist.
Sallow!
Kidda!
- Sallow!
- Shut up!
- Kidda!
- Shut up!
Kidda, they accepted it!
They accepted the challenge!
- It's posted!
- Who cares?
They accepted!
This is ridiculous,
no one comes to these things.
They're not contest at all.
Nevertheless,
they can be quite brutal.
Much more so than
the League games.
I don't like brutality,
I like the heroics.
I like the blood of heroes.
The blood of heroes?
Be patient.
How come you're on?
It's just a challenge match.
You see that one? The Slash?
I'll put him down,
you put a pin on him.
A pin? In a challenge match?
Do as you're told.
I'll have him down in two.
- Why can't I play him?
- Do as you're told.
What, is he good or something?
Not anymore.
I've never been so scared before.
I never expected lose,
that's why.
I've always expected to win,
even when I was losing.
Then win.
Win?
Win.
- Isn't that...
- Yes.
Want a kiss, little girl?
Yeah, come and kiss me,
you fart fuck.
One hundred stones!
Three times!
- Number two.
- Number two!
- Number four.
- Number four!
- F to 8.
- Tighten it up.
- I got the right.
- Where's the hook?
Red!
-Red! Red!
Fuckers! Slime fuckers!
Watch your back!
The pin?
- They got a pin on Sallow!
- Shit!
Gonzo's had him pinned
to protect him.
Take it easy, old fella.
It'll be over soon.
My right!
Give it up!
- Couple more stones.
- Fuck you!
Twenty! Come on, move it!
- Shit.
- What happened?
Your Qwik's a good one.
She's gonna get
the attention of the League.
Come on, move it!
Come on, you silk loving
piece of shit! Come on!
35!
Kidda, I'm right behind you.
Grab it! Faster! Faster!
50!
That's ridiculous!
60 stones!
It's a challenge!
60 stones!
60 stones!
A challenge.
They still playing!
Come on, hit her!
91!
Hang on!
93 ...
- 94!
- Go now! Go!
95!
96!
97!
98!
Go! Go! Come on!
Hundred stones... Once.
Good, old man.
A hundred fucking rocks!
She can't stand.
Think it's broken.
You were good.
I wanted to win.
It's not over.
They got replacements.
There are only four of us.
Five.
Five of us.
I want you to do a fish hook.
- On who?
- The one sat on me.
Mbulu, you do the thrust.
You protected him,
you asshole.
Lord Vile,
I've broken Juggers in half,
smashed their bones,
left the ground behind me
wet with brains.
I would do anything to win.
But I've never hurt a soul,
for any reason but to put
a dog's skull on a stake.
And I never will.
But you didn't put any
fucking dog's skull
on any fucking stake!
No challenge has ever gone
past 26th stone.
This one won't go 26 more.
One hundred stones!
Two times!
Ten stones, Sallow.
Not one more.
He's all yours, Sallow.
Walk...
Slowly.
