PEMBROKE:To my
fellow members of the board.
A man cannot unsee the truth.
He cannot willingly
return to darkness...
or go blind once he has
the gift of sight...
any more than
he can be unborn.
We are the only species
capable of self-reflection.
The only species
with the toxin of self-doubt
written into our genetic code.
Unequal to our gifts,
we build,
we buy, we consume.
We wrap ourselves
in the illusion
of material success.
We cheat and deceive
as we claw our way...
to the pinnacle of what
we define as achievement.
Superiority to other men.

Of course.
PEMBROKE:
There is a sickness inside us.
Rising like the bile
that leaves
that bitter taste
at the back of our throats.
It's there in every one of you
seated around the table.
We deny its existence
until one day
the body rebels
against the mind...
and screams out,
"I am not a well man."
(YAWNS)
No doubt you will think
only of the merger.
That unclean melding of two
equally diseased institutions.
But the truth
cannot be ignored.
For only when
we know what ails us
can we hope to find the cure.
I will not return.
Do not attempt
to contact me again.

LOCKHART: Hydrotherapy?
That is correct.

The sanitarium is built
over an ancient aquifer...
that offers uniquely
rejuvenating qualities.
LOCKHART: Rebuilt.

If you would like
to leave a note...
I'd happily pass it along

I understand the work

I'm not a patient.
I was in an accident
You signed the admission form.
I have it right here.
That's bullshit.
I did warn you about
possible delusions, remember?
A side effect of the toxins
leaving the body.
?
And my leg,
is that a delusion
Mr. Lockhart has been
a disruptive element
since he arrived.
He stole
confidential medical files...
assaulted a member
of our Dental staff...
and threatened Mr. Pembroke.
I didn't threaten anybody!
I believe
your exact words were...
"If I have to,
I'll hit him over the head
"and drag him out
by his hair."
I was sent here to bring
Pembroke back to New York!
According to your employer,
a Mr. Green...
you're being investigated
by the Securities

You're one of them.

Mr. Lockhart.
You're not a well man.
Stop saying that!
Let us help you.
Get back!

I know about the experiments
The baron and his wife.
He has been spending time
with Mrs. Watkins.
CONSTABLE: Who is Watkins?
She was institutionalized
before she came to us.
The others humor her...
but clearly
Mr. Lockhart's condition
has made him susceptib
le to her conspiracies.

I know what you're
trying to do. All of you
You're trying to make 
me think I'm insane.
I have seen this before.
It's not uncommon.
Some deep-seated childhood
trauma rises to the surface...
something a patient
has been running from
their entire life.
In your case...
I would say misplaced guilt...
over the death of your father.
How do you know about that?
I never told you that.
You didn't have to.
That's why you came to us,
isn't it?
I saw him.

Pembroke is dead

Pembroke?
Please keep him away from me.

To the members of the board...
You sent me here

To retrieve a man

to your world.
But I realize now...
that is not the reason
I am here.
There is a sickness
inside each of us.
We do our best
to deny its existence...
dealing in lies...
and distraction.
Until one day the body
rebels against the mind
and screams out...
"I am not a well man."
A man cannot unsee the truth.
A man cannot unsee the truth.

Ah, yes. Remarkable creatures.
Anywhere else on the planet,
this species lives
a dozen years, at most.
Here, in our aquifer...
they can live 300.
For the human physiology...
the effect of the water
can be quite toxic
as you have discovered.
Unless, of course,
it is properly filtered.
The baron devised the process.
Using the bodies of peasants
that belonged to his land...
he managed
to distill the water...
to its life-giving essence.
Of course, he paid
a terrible price
for his ingenuity.
His only mistake...
was to use subjects
who were unwilling.
