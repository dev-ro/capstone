One. Two. Three.
Welcome to your
Bachelor's Party.
Where's the party?
It's your last night as a bachelor.
Sit. Have a drink,
listen to some good music. Relax.
Don't sound so depressing.
Tonight is all I have.
I've promised them so much more.
Think like a guy who's my age,
not yours.
You didn't take me to Vegas,
that's okay.
But the least you could have done
was arrange some strippers.
How old are you?
32.
It's been 35 years
since I turned young.
I've never had to pay for chance
encounters and romantic evenings.
I never pay for sex.
A night that's earned has something
special about its morning.
That's a nice pickup line.
But seriously,
where are the strippers?
What's your wife going to say?
She is not my wife yet.
And she knows.
It's my Bachelor's Party.
You're so naive.
Almost dumb..
He's so naive.
I knew it.
I knew it, bro.
Who's the groom?
I should have known!
And I knew it and I was right.
Look at what you are doing!
Aren't you disgusted with yourself?
Like, really.
How are you standing here?
I can't stand you right now!
You pig!
You..
You..
Which guy would say no to
a stripper on his Bachelor's Party?
Baby..
- I hate you. You ruined my life.
Ruined what?
It's not like I had sex with her.
I can't believe I was going
to get married to a shit face..
Guys, listen.
Don't fight.
Great advice.
You have better advice?
Are they breaking
up because of me?
They aren't breaking
up because of me either.
She wanted to test him.
She asked me to do it and I did.
But one should be smart
enough to know where to stop.
Even I threw a Bachelor's Party.
He asked me to get strippers.
But did I?
Because you know
your friend too well.
Which guy would say no to
a stripper on his Bachelor's Party?
What do you expect him to say?
'Sorry, ma'am,
but I am getting married tomorrow.'
Should we just cancel
the wedding then?
Listen to me. He is innocent.
Babe, I saw what he was trying to..
- It's not what it looked like.
He was not into it.
Guys often succumb to peer pressure
wondering what their friends
will say.
He was just pretending.
But he went for it..
- Trust me.
I was sitting on his lap.
I can tell.
I couldn't feel a thing.
Really?
It had only been 15 seconds, and..
Guys often succumb
to peer pressure.
He had to act happy.
He was not into it.
Trust me.
Trust me, baby.
Great time..
- I am getting married.
Thank you.
- Bye.
I am getting married.
Bye.
- Bye.
Good night.
Hi!
Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello.
Good morning.
- Morning.
Wild night?
- Coffee?
Thanks.
I don't remember exactly,
but I think I had fun last night.
I mean,
I'm sure we must have had fun.
No one's ever complained.
I just want to clarify that you
shouldn't have any expectations.
I mean last night was nice
but don't think we have a future.
And don't get me wrong.
It's not like I didn't enjoy.
But it's just that I am not looking
at a relationship right now.
I just want to make it clear
in case you have any expectations
that this can turn into something.
And trust me, it's got nothing
to do with you not being so young.
I know this must be sounding
weird and you must be wondering
how a girl can say all this after
waking up in a stranger's bedroom.
I guess your bedroom got lucky.
My guest room got lucky.
You were saying?
You mean nothing
happened between us?
Why?
I mean, you don't get lucky with
a hot girl like me everyday.
Plus you're not that old
that you can't do anything.
So you could do me and you didn't.
There must have been a reason.
I don't sleep with drunk women.
I don't give them the excuse
of not being in their senses.
Whosoever they are, they should
know what they are doing.
You lost your chance.
You're not going to get
me while I'm in my senses.
"Prancing around without a care."
"Drinking the night away."
"Prancing around without a care."
"Drinking the night away."
"When my heart insists"
"I just grab a peg."
"Makes me blush till I turn red."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Your feet sway and your
eyes look the other way."
"Because you drink up a storm."
"Your feet sway and your
eyes look the other way."
"because you drink up a storm."
"Leaving empty
bottles in your wake."
"Leaving empty
bottles in your wake."
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."
"All I need is
the local specialty"
"then I am going to dance
till the end."
"All I need is
the local specialty"
"then I am going to dance
till the end."
"Guys keep shouting,
and I just pout."
"I want to just lose control."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Guys say I am intoxicating."
"I am intoxicating."
"Leaving empty bottles
in your wake."
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."
"Leaving empty bottles
in your wake."
"When you're high, you can't
stop grooving to the beat."
Trying to drown your sorrows?
Regretting that
you lost your chance.
I know I am hot.
Aren't they looking happy?
God bless those two.
You almost got
their wedding cancelled.
Me?
I am the reason they got married.
They were almost on
the verge of calling it off.
I don't get it.
If there is a need to test it
then how can it be love?
I have a question.
Is sleeping together
once enough to fall in love?
Then how can it be
enough to fall out of it?
True.
What a great thought.
Well, it's hard to answer
that question, but often
one falls in love
when you don't sleep together.
You are hitting on me.
As I said
you don't have a chance
with me while I am in my senses.
Are you ever in your senses?
Do you have a problem with my
drinking?
I like alcohol.
You look married and your actions
clearly indicate you're divorced.
How old are you?
I just turned 25
a couple of days ago.
You see
according to the
constitution of dating
age minus 7 into 2
is the maximum allowed.
What?
I am 26.
So 26 minus 7 into 2 is..
38.
38 is the maximum allowed.
Then you have no chance.
I am much older than that.
That will be a little weird.
By the way,
you've got the formula all wrong.
It's into 2 minus 7.
26 into 2 minus 7. 45.
Are you under 45?
- No.
Don't pine too much for me.
I'll call if I'm in the mood.
Seems weird
now that you think about it.
But doesn't feel that way.
24 years' age gap
is a little too much.
But doesn't feel that way to me.
That's called a generation gap,
not an age-gap.
Rich old man, hot young girl.
Hot young girl with daddy issues.
Spare me
the psychological knowledge.
What daddy issues?
How would I know?
I'll have to do a
session with her for that.
Give her my card.
And tell her I only meet by
appointment.
Are you out of your mind?
You think I'll refer you
to a girl I've only met twice.
And you're intellectualizing
this for no reason.
It's pretty simple.
A guy and a girl met.
They flirted.
And they liked it.
Let me put that right.
A rich old guy and
a hot young girl met.
She saw the money,
the old guy saw the youth.
And now they are both trying
to achieve what they don't have.
Elementary, my dear Ashish.
You're a very negative person.
But my degree is real.
It's not been photo-shopped
and printed
on a good quality paper for me
to frame it.
Who is the doctor here?
Me.
I handle hundreds
of cases like this.
Oh, please!
Every week you show
up asking me to lend you money.
Nobody comes to get counselled
by you.
You do, don't you?
Imagine how low you can get.
And what are you
trying to assert here?
I'll pay you back every
last penny I owe with interest.
You're going to need it when she
robs you of everything you have.
You are a misogynist.
Of course.
Because no girl has ever
flirted with a guy for his money.
Misogynist.
If I am a misogynist,
then you are a dog.
You think it's love.
It's just lust. Plain lust!
Who knows your feelings better,
you or me?
I am the doctor.
If you're a doctor, then I.. I..
What?
Imagining you as a doctor is so
difficult
I can't find an example for it.
Your time is up.
Get out.
Your time is up.
58 minutes.
Fine, sit.
Pervert old man.
You..
- Time up.
Sir, we plan on bottling
Arctic Air.
In 2 to 10 litre bottles.
And so, whenever you
want to escape from the
stressful pollution
filled environment you're in
you simply
open a bottle of fresh air.
It's so clever, isn't it?
And you can have a vacation
in your very own office.
'Hope you weren't
getting restless.'
It's genius, isn't it?
'You were getting restless
to ask this. Weren't you?'
We're going to call it..
A Breath of Fresh..
'Oh, please.'
'It's okay. You can admit it.'
'Okay, don't act smart.
Meet me at the bar at 12.'
Thank you so much.
I can't have two.
Cheers, mate.
Thank you, good night.
Good night, Bob.
Bye, love you.
Such decent old guys those two.
So cute.
They come here every day
and wait until the bar closes.
I thought
my age would be a problem.
But you only find old guys cute.
Do you own the place?
No. I work here.
I'm poor.
Did you come all the way
here from India to work in a bar?
I came to study.
College got over,
and I started working.
As a student,
I used to bartend on weekends.
Now I have a job
from Monday to Friday
and this on weekends.
And before you ask any more
questions
the job pays good money,
but it's boring.
And I do this because it's fun.
I'm an Engineer by degree.
There are two kinds
of people in this world.
Career oriented and job oriented.
I am the job-oriented kind.
But you look like the career type.
Do tell me. Don't be shy.
I am into investments.
I invest in companies while they
are still young and have a scope
so I can reap the benefits later.
And I thought my
age will be a problem.
You invest in things
before they grow
so you can take advantage later.
Only if I see scope in it.
Did you invite me
over to do the dishes?
To check the scope.
You made me do the dishes,
clean the place.
Now let me drop you home too.
I am not going home.
Why?
My roommate's boyfriend
has come over.
And he's very irritating.
Go ahead and ask, don't be shy.
What?
You can stay over at my place.
Even I'll get some dishes done.
So, what's the biggest problem
men have nearing their fifties?
They can't score. Period.
They bought into the lies
of Pharma companies
ever since mid-life crises hit,
but they still can't score.
Problem is they are trying
to score with the younger ladies.
Hello.
Is the offer still on?
If you promise
I'll be safe with you.
I will try my best.
Send me your address
and I'll pick you up.
I almost bought your pitch.
India.
Punjabi.
When did you get here?
I just got here.
I mean,
when did you come to London?
2001.
Illegal immigrant?
Visa.
Did you get citizenship?
Great.
What brings you here?
I'm here to pick someone up.
Me too.
My girlfriend lives here.
She is angry,
but I will make it up to her.
"You still make my heart
skip a beat."
"I miss you, baby,
from head to feet."
"I admit I was a cheat."
And I'll add a nice line
after this.
Nice?
I know.
Who are you waiting for?
Your girlfriend's roommate.
Ayesha's roommate.
Ayesha?
Baby.
You didn't tell me
that your dad's visiting.
I told you it's over.
Just leave me alone.
We're done.
Okay, fine.
But our fight wasn't that serious
that you couldn't tell me
dad is coming.
And I even wrote a rap for you.
"You still make my heart
skip a beat."
"I miss you, baby,
from head to feet."
"I admit I was a cheat."
"I admit I was a cheat."
"Swear on my mom,
it will never repeat."
Thank you, sir.
He's not my dad.
Then who is he?
Why should I tell you?
Where are you going, Ayesha?
Who is this guy?
Your uncle, older brother..
Tell me something, Ayesha.
I have a confession.
I lied to you.
That wasn't my roommate's
boyfriend, he was my boyfriend
that guy you just met.
He cheated on me within
a month of dating.
It's 10 minutes late for
it to qualify as a confession.
But okay.
"You make my.."
"You make my heart.."
"You make my heart skip.."
Really?
You okay?
Yes, just irritated.
Ayesha. Ayesha.
Please hear me out.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Do you have no shame?
Get lost and don't
show me your face again.
I really love you.
Let's just give us one more chance.
Please.
Even if you are the last guy on
earth, you won't have a chance.
Do you understand?
Now go to hell.
At least hear me out.
Ayesha, please hear me out.
Please, just this once.
Open the door, Ayesha.
Ayesha, please.
Ayesha, please.
Please listen to me.
Ayesha, please.
Ayesha, what are you doing?
Ayesha, please listen to me.
Ayesha..
Hello.
She is all I have, Uncle..
Ashish.
Uncle Ashish, please talk to her.
This is not the way.
You tell me, is this the way
to behave?
Whatever happens,
happens for the best.
I had even booked a cottage
for us on the outskirts of London
where we would've
lived after marriage.
You may be able to see it
from here also.
There is nothing wrong with you.
You can find more girls.
And anyway,
Ayesha is not fit for you.
No, Uncle.
She's the right one for me.
Think about it.
Everyone makes small mistakes.
But that doesn't justify kissing a
stranger just to make you jealous.
Yes. Exactly, Uncle.
Ashish.
Uncle Ashish,
what kind of behaviour is this?
Who does something like this?
Are you a stranger?
If you are a stranger, then why
is she staying with you, Ashish?
Uncle..
Ashish.
She is using me too
just like she used you.
And how exactly did Ayesha use me?
What else will you call it?
Till it suited her, she stayed with
you, went out with you, kissed you.
And when she got over you,
she kissed someone else.
If you don't value yourself,
then others won't either.
It's about your self-respect.
You must prove to her
that she is the one losing out.
How?
Come on.
- Let's go.
Stop calling her,
stop pleading, stop crying!
Be strong.
Be very, very strong.
Don't even look back.
Then she will understand.
You are right.
That's the only way
to get Ayesha back, Uncle.
Ashish.
I am glad you understand.
Now you better leave
before she comes out
otherwise she will think
that you're good-for-nothing.
You're still here after
she said all those things to you.
Thank you, Uncle.
Only you understand me.. Uncle..
'At the gym,
Alfred will get you.'
All that effort for me?
Don't put so much performance
pressure on yourself.
Elders say that one should
pick a hobby befitting their age.
What's the point of ending up with
broken bones at such an old age?
Don't insult yourself so much.
And anyway, I changed my
mind after seeing your choice.
I cannot stoop that low.
You are better off with him.
Then why did you drive him away?
If a poor, helpless woman
seeks help, I cannot turn her down.
I am old-fashioned that way.
You're old in everything?
You are really cheap.
Show me your body.
Show it.
- Shut up.
At least show me your chest.
Are you mad?
- Or your biceps.
Come on. Don't be shy.
What about abs?
Do you have abs?
Breakfast?
Unfortunately,
there are no potholes here.
You won't get an excuse
to hit the brakes.
You're really cheap.
What are you doing?
How long have you been here?
- It's been 16 years.
Family?
India.
Kids?
A son and a daughter.
That's been my only regret.
In order to live my life on
my own terms, I left them behind.
Feeling bad for your kids,
not for your wife?
It was a mutual decision
between Manju and me.
We were in college together.
In the beginning,
we both wanted the same life.
But as the years went by,
we both wanted different things.
The kids had no say in this.
You know, people say I am selfish.
Maybe I am.
I accept I am not a good father.
But I feel if I had stayed back
then I would've been worse.
I wish I could live this life
with Manju, Ishika, and Ishaan.
But doesn't matter if I can't.
You are a cool guy.
I mean, very few 50-year-olds
are so happy and so cool.
Try as much as you want,
the fact is
you're struggling with yourself
as to why you can't resist me.
Constantly bringing up
the age-discussion
only to make yourself feel normal,
that you..
And what?
That you were with me last night
and are with me again this morning.
Shall we order?
What?
You get a text saying
'Come down to the bar'.
When you get there,
you find out that she is a waiter.
Only as a hobby.
Fair enough.
She does it as a hobby.
You spend two hours with her,
cleaning the place
doing the dishes,
and let her rent your room for free
all this for nothing in return.
Are you blind?
Can't you see that she's
trying to take over your home?
You're out of your mind
and you're over-analyzing it.
Who is the doctor?
Me.
Should I show you my degree?
- Fine!
Continue.
People seek support from
their children when they turn old
not from wives that
are their children's age.
At a time when you should be
walking your daughter
down the aisle, you are..
What's the opposite
of walking down the aisle?
Whatever.
You're doing just that.
I am not the first guy in the world
who's thinking of dating a girl
half his age.
There have been others.
Were they all unsuccessful?
Oh, really?
Name one successful couple.
Come on, tell me.
Michael Douglas and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.
George Clooney and his wife.
Saif and Kareena.
I have nothing to say.
I can't solve your stupid problems.
Exactly. Exactly
what I am talking about.
Just shut up.
I never said I have a problem.
Every time I come over
you make me sit in that
chair and send me the bill.
Now I know why you
feel she is exploiting me.
Because you exploit me, you feel
everyone else exploits me too.
Get out.
Get out now.
Be thankful that I see
you without an appointment.
I handle ten cases like this
every day.
And there will be a problem,
I guarantee it.
If you don't end up in that chair
sobbing your heart out one day
then I'll tear up my degree.
That photo-shopped one.
It's real.
Smells nice.
Indian?
No, I've made pasta with a
pinch of salt and a dash of pepper.
Indian!
I don't eat lentils.
- Why?
I just don't.
- Who doesn't eat lentils?
I don't.
As you wish.
What else will you eat?
You eat,
I'll check what else we have.
I know you put in a lot
of effort to make that.
And it even looks tasty.
But I can't find anything to eat.
Let's go out.
Really? Nothing at all?
I am leaving the lentils
only for your sake.
Now I feel guilty.
I'll have it with curd instead.
No, no. I'll feel guilty
if you don't eat.
Let's go out.
Have a pleasant evening.
Is he going to leave us with
cutlery for the next three days?
One for the oysters, soup..
- Mr. Fancy.
I know.
We start with the
ones on the outside
and use the ones
on the inside in the end.
You are not the only
sophisticated one here.
I didn't know that when
I came here for the first time.
Illiterate.
The price of a chicken entree is
enough to open my own poultry farm.
Ms. Sophisticated,
I come here for business lunches.
Calm down.
- It's okay.
Even the Indians
out here are so English
that they won't understand Hindi.
You insisted on coming
to this fancy place.
I wanted some simple Indian food.
I want to eat, not pretend to eat.
What do you expect
me to order from this?
Lentil soup with minced
vegetables, with a hint of mint.
The menu is for English people.
It's not my fault that
they don't know what 'Dal' means.
Your fault is that you thought you
would take me to an upscale place
I'll be impressed
and think you're hot shit..
Shut up. Seriously shut up.
Just tell me what you want to eat.
Forget it.
Looking at your level, if
I take you where I go to eat
you won't stop cribbing.
Come on.
They serve you 10 pieces of cutlery
to justify their exorbitant prices.
We just want to eat.
It's not like they saute
their food with gold or silver.
It's a 150 years old restaurant.
Seriously, everything in
my life these days is antique.
Can you tell me the time, buddy?
It's 11.
He's asking for the time
and you're giving him your watch.
We're being mugged.
Wallet.
Him?
Even the bouncers at
my club are double his size.
Are they here now?
- You are.
What's the point of all
that boxing you do?
Will you just let
them take what they want?
I do it for fitness.
I like your coat.
You're simply giving
him whatever he's asking for.
Will you let him take me away too?
You don't like me?
"Singham."
"The mind boggles,
the body shivers"
"when they learn of
the arrival of.."
"Singham."
Can we go?
What?
A slap?
Go on.
I want to see him fly.
Make him fly.
He fell down here.
And that guy is still moving.
Do you want me to kill them?
At least knock him out cold.
Like a knockout in boxing.
Hit him.
He was going to touch me.
Your wallet.
This is for looking at my woman.
I'm asking you to punch,
but you're delivering a dialogue.
Jacket.
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Of course.
I should have let them
take you away.
Imagine my plight if
you hadn't been around today.
How can I thank you for putting
your life at stake to save me?
This is for trying to be a hero.
There is an age for everything.
You picked a fight
for such a small amount.
Did I challenge them?
I was giving them everything.
But no.
Who said, 'What's the point of
all that boxing you do?'
'Will you let him
take me away too?'
They never even looked at you.
You gave them that idea.
You are so attention-hungry.
Poor guys
got beaten up for no reason.
Poor guy.
You walk around wearing
an expensive watch
and I am hungry for attention.
Is it my fault that
I am not poor like you?
Was it my idea to walk?
We could have just given
them the money and left.
That reminds me, where's my money?
What money?
The ones you took from
them for looking at 'my woman'!
Forget it.
I beat them up, my fingers
are swollen, so I earned it.
You will skim off a woman?
Yes, I will.
Fine.
You can keep it.
And anyway, I am not your woman.
Okay. Okay.
Half-half?
Good night.
"I have witnessed
your beauty in my dreams."
"My heart feels you look familiar."
"Every day I woke up with the image
of your beautiful face in my eyes."
"But I never knew that
you were meant for me"
"and now I feel.."
"Even though we met late"
"at least we did."
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."
"We came closer."
"Even though we met late"
"at least we did."
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."
"We came close."
"I want to be with you every day"
"using any excuse."
"I'll begin to understand myself,
once I understand you."
"I want to see what
you want me to see"
"and hear what you want me
to hear."
"I don't need to breathe"
"because you're my life now."
"Even though we met late"
"at least we did."
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."
"We came closer."
"Even though we met late"
"at least we did."
"Slowly and gradually, we came.."
"We came closer."
I am sure you must be dealing
with many cases like these
ones with age difference.
Hundreds of them.
But they all come late.
- What?
I mean they should
come six months earlier.
But they all turn up
after the divorce.
I mean, it's quite amazing.
Even in a highly educated
place like London
the concept of a prenup
is unknown to most of them.
It's not completely their fault,
you know.
The first lesson
of every gold-digging session
is about how to avoid
the prenup discussion.
You should call me
to give a lecture one day.
Don't listen to him. He's crazy.
This is why no one ever
invites him to their home.
Really? - I'll get a refill.
- For me too.
Okay.
Have you lost your mind?
You should thank me.
The prenup's going
to come up sooner or later.
This is not your clinic.
Really?
If a cardiologist visits a friend
and his friend gets a heart attack
the cardiologist won't save him
but tell him
to come to his clinic the next day.
A doctor is always a doctor,
whether he's in his clinic or not.
Have your dinner and leave.
Don't make an issue,
I'll tear up my degree.
Fine. Let's get serious
and talk about the next step.
Marriage. Kids.
What have you thought?
No.
- What no?
You haven't thought, or you're not
looking to start a family?
I didn't give it a thought.
- Then do it now.
I don't want to.
What do you mean you don't want to?
Thank you.
The weather seems
to be getting bad.
Did you give it a thought?
- Gave what a thought?
Avoiding the question
won't make it go away.
Do you want to get married now?
Do you want to have kids now?
Not now, but at some point.
And yes, at some point
I want to have kids.
Some point means
marriage in two years
and kids in four.
Ashish, there's no point of
discussing it with that attitude.
Let it be.
What can I say, Ayesha?
I am 50.
I've been a bad husband.
I've been a bad father.
I don't want to have kids
and not be there for them again.
In two years I'll turn 52
and in four years I'll turn 54.
I don't want to be the father
of a 10-year-old at the age of 65.
By the time he's in college,
I'll turn 70
or I might not even be around
anymore.
I can't.. I mean..
What are we doing then?
I am living the day.
And what about tomorrow?
I don't know.
There's a big difference
between your tomorrow and mine.
Your tomorrow
is much more than mine.
This won't work, will it?
Everyone will always think
I am with you for your money.
And you're with me
because I am hot and young.
I am immature and you are boring.
I want to explore new things
but you've practically
experienced all of them first hand.
And you'll have to do everything
all over again for my sake.
You'll have to go back to
the same places again.
Make the same mistakes again.
Have the same quarrels again.
Cajole me again.
Choose our song again.
Think of a pet name again.
Tell the same lies again.
Endure the same taunts again.
Laugh for the same joys again.
Shed tears over the
same sorrows again.
You will be forced to relive
your life all over again
and I'll feel I am living
an already lived, stale life.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What can I say?
You have already made up your mind.
That's the sensibility
I don't want.
I won't make fake promises
of efforts I know I can't make.
But I know that I love you.
I know that life doesn't come to
a standstill when someone leaves.
It's just a matter of habit.
You will get over it soon.
And so will I.
"I know we've parted ways,
sweetheart"
"but I still want you to know."
"I know we've parted ways,
sweetheart"
"but I still want you to know."
"If you ever miss me"
"just come over."
"If you think I'll ever forget you"
"then you are wrong."
"If you ever miss me"
"just come over."
"I had no one
except for you."
"You had become more
important to me than breathing."
"I may not mean anything to you"
"but you meant everything to me."
"Don't ever leave me"
"is what you always used to say."
"I have no more reasons to smile"
"as even you moved on like time."
"It had fallen for you,
and still is"
"my heat's crazy, you know."
"If you ever miss me"
"just come over."
"I did as you said"
"only I know how
I consoled my heart."
"Be happy, wherever you are."
"There was never anything
between us anyway."
"Doesn't matter how far away
we are from each other's eyes"
"we will meet everyday
in the world of dreams."
"This is as far as
we were meant to be."
"Now you must return."
"If you ever miss me"
"just come over."
Seriously? Her?
This is all
you could find after me?
You think she can
help you get over me.
You have no standard, but think
about my reputation.
You can settle for anything?
I can't believe that
from this, you've gone to this.
I can't get over you.
You said I will get over you,
but I can't.
See, you don't know everything.
You can't know everything.
I am not asking for much.
If nothing else, then make me
a habit you can't give up.
You are a total amateur.
I was thinking I should introduce
you to Manju and the kids.
Why?
I mean, how come suddenly?
Just..
I never imagined something like
this would ever happen in my life.
But now that it has
I would want them to know.
I mean, if you are comfortable.
When was the last time
you met them?
It's been a couple of years.
Never had a chance to
go and meet them recently.
Do you need their blessings?
That's not it.
I was joking! Let's go.
Not today. We'll leave next week.
Okay.
Don't worry.
Nowadays it's not a
big deal to meet the family.
It's cool.
I am not from 'nowadays'.
'I am not from 'nowadays'.'
We need a better story.
What story?
Our story,
which you will tell them.
About how we met.
Meaning?
I mean, what are you going
to say when they ask how we met?
Look at the mountains.
It's so pretty.
See.
She came home dressed as a stripper
and then you found her unconscious
in your home the next day.
That story won't work here.
That story won't work anywhere.
Exactly.
So then?
I said we'll tell them the truth
but I never said
we'll tell them details.
We met through common friends,
simple.
Too boring.
Think of something else.
Hey, look at the clouds.
How are you, Pintu?
- Fine.
Get the luggage.
I'll say we met at
the temple while praying.
That will make a
good impression on them.
Don't worry, I love you,
you love me.
No one's going to
ask any more questions.
Ishika.
- Who called you?
Ishika?
- Who the hell called you here?
My daughter.
- Pintu.
Keep the luggage back.
Do it now.
Who told you to get their luggage?
If any random guy walks in here,
will you get their luggage inside?
Who called him here?
It wasn't me.
Who else could it be?
You can't stop smiling.
I wanted to call him,
I even gave it a thought.
But I swear on you,
I didn't call him.
Of all the days,
did it have to be today?
I didn't call him, Ishu.
Munna, who called you here?
Am I not welcome in my own home?
And what does she mean
by today out of all the days?
You can come whenever you like.
Just ask us first.
I'll be right back.
Your home?
What is the colour of
the walls of 'your' home?
I don't care who called him here,
tell him to go back.
Where are your manners?
What's the point now?
Dad.
Hi!
- Ishaan!
Hi, I am Ishaan. His son.
And that's my mom.
Did you call him here?
Why did you?
I told you it was her.
Look at how she is welcoming him.
Traitor.
I didn't call him.
Please tell him to go back,
I don't want him here right now.
Go inside. Don't make
a scene in front of the staff.
What's wrong with her?
Her boyfriend and his father
are coming over tomorrow
to discuss the wedding.
But..
Manju.
- Ayesha.
My wife.
My secretary.
Ishika is getting married and
no one even bothered to tell me.
She isn't getting married.
Her boyfriend's coming
over with his father to meet us.
Even we are meeting
them for the first time.
And what was the point
of having told you?
Would you have come down
from London to meet them?
You couldn't respect any
relationship while you were here
and now you're saying you'd fly
down from London to see the boy.
Does he really think I
need his approval to get married?
This is not about my approval
but I would definitely
like to meet the guy.
What will you say when
they ask about the father?
Were you planning on inviting
me to the wedding, or..
I've already told them
that my father is no more.
Not even separated.
Just dead.
Not dead.
We said he's no more.
Meaning
you're no longer her father.
That's so absurd.
Just because Manju
and I are separated
am I not her father anymore? Give..
Thank you.
Very good.
Make a scene in front of
the outsiders
so you can look
like the victims.
I will wait outside.
Hello, ma'am. - Bless you, dear.
- Sir..
They're fresh
just the way you like them.
VK, that's Ashish.
Ishika and Ishaan's father.
I see.
How are you?
I am VK.
VK lives in our cottage.
Hi.
Can you excuse us
for a minute, sir?
We're in the middle
of an important discussion.
Mr. VK can stay.
But you just said we won't
discuss this in front of outsiders.
He's not an outsider.
Six months ago
I came here on a holiday.
But after seeing Manju, I realized
that actually life's out here.
So I paid for the entire year.
I've never heard about him.
I've never heard about you either.
I mean they never mentioned you.
By the way, what do you do?
Right now I am trying to
solve an important family matter.
He's asking about your profession.
Go ahead, tell him. Don't be shy.
I am into finance.
Finance! That's fantastic.
Even I am into finance!
I've lent around two myself in the
market at an interest rate of 2%.
How much do you charge?
This is not that kind of finance.
Maybe you're into something else.
But you remind me of a few lines.
"Neither wife, nor kids,
neither father, nor mother"
"the whole thing is that,
his only priority is money."
I knew it right away
that he's a thief.
I mean you steal others' poems.
Can we finish our discussion now?
What were you discussing?
He just found out that
Ishika told Rishi and his father
that her father is no more.
Oh, yes, that topic did come up.
But no need to worry.
By the way, how long
are you planning on staying?
He needs to go.
They are arriving tomorrow morning.
I am not going anywhere.
Why are you hell-bent
on messing up my life?
Let's just lie.
And anyway, he's going to
stay at a hotel or a guesthouse.
Just say that he's a tourist.
Right, sir?
Not a bad idea.
Are you all out of your mind?
Whenever we meet again
won't they think
what the guest is still doing here?
Are you going to meet them again?
I am your father and that's
how I am going to meet them.
Ashish, she has already told them.
Whether right or wrong,
it's already done.
We can't tell them as soon
as they come that she lied to them.
And even you didn't
inform about your arrival.
Otherwise,
we would've thought of something.
My daughter's getting
married and I am her father.
I want to see who she is marrying.
You will have to manage.
- You dropped in uninvited.
Why should we manage?
But he is right.
We cannot call him a guest.
Nor can we ask him to leave.
Why? Why can't we ask him to leave?
He cannot come and go as he wishes.
I have an idea,
we'll say he's a distant relative.
They won't even meet
that often. This lie will pass.
And no one will ask questions.
But no one will invite a distant
relative to the first meeting.
Then there's just one solution.
Say he's your brother.
You..
Only for their sake.
The uncle can definitely come over.
And anyway, there's nothing
left between you and Manju.
Feelings aren't an issue either.
That's a good idea.
What's good?
Stop repeating yourself.
What do you think
you're doing here?
You'll make your own son
the brother of his wife?
Ayesha, I am really sorry.
Ishika only targeted you because..
Ayesha, I apologise
for Ishika's behaviour.
Please don't feel offended.
It's okay, I understand.
Have dinner with us
before you leave.
Leave?
If she could stay here as well..
Here? At the cottage?
No?
Two cottages are already occupied.
And I've reserved the third
one for Rishi and his father.
Book a hotel for her.
It's okay. I'll manage.
Sure?
I don't want to be a burden.
What are you saying?
We're trying to manage.
This is her first trip here.
She is my responsibility.
It's not right
to put her in a hotel.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Ishaan.
Take dad's luggage to your room.
And put Ayesha's luggage
in Ishika's room.
Are you seriously doing this?
- Ishu.
Let's not make her uncomfortable.
- Ayeshu.
Ayesha.
Sorted.
Sorted.
Shall we?
Shall we?
So Mr. VK suggested
that we call dad our uncle.
And we all readily agreed.
Great idea.
So, this is your room.
My room is right next door.
Please let me know
if you need anything.
Bag.
Oh..
Thank you.
You've lost weight.
Nonsense.
Thank you, Ayesha.
Ashish, I was thinking,
I will check into a hotel.
Why?
Don't you like your room?
No, I just don't want to..
Don't stress yourself,
and eat your food.
I don't know how things are
in London
but out here, men who are 20 years
older to you are called 'uncle'.
She is a colleague.
How can she call me uncle?
- Let her call you sir.
You're older than her,
and her boss as well.
You don't deserve any respect
but that much respect
she can give you.
He doesn't like lentils.
He likes mine.
Dad.
Do you know how old Ayesha is?
Good night.
'We need to talk.'
'Come out through the kitchen,
not the main door.'
What the hell!
What the hell!
What the hell!
I mean, secretary? Seriously?
What happened?
I never planned to tell them
everything as soon as I arrived.
And I never imagined
Ishika would react this way.
And her in-laws would show up.
I couldn't have at that moment.
What?
Well, after hearing
about Ishika's wedding..
How is Ishika's wedding
connected with us?
Come on, you know it was weird.
So you introduced me as your
secretary.
Do you know how stupid
this is for me?
And why am I here?
Why do I feel I am the only one
who's uncomfortable
with all of this?
You think I was comfortable?
You think I was enjoying it.
Why would you feel uncomfortable?
You ate lentils,
which you apparently never eat.
Oh, so it's about the lentils.
No. It's about me
being your secretary
it's about you being a coward,
and it's about your lie..
I know.
I will tell everyone about
us as soon as things get normal.
It's why we're here.
What do you mean normal?
I mean as soon as
her in-laws leave.
Of course.
What are they going to think?
Ishika's father is with a
girl that's as old as her daughter.
Sorry, uncle!
You are her uncle.
Your wife is now your sister,
and your lover is your secretary.
You're never going
to tell them in this life.
Ex-wife.
Ex-lover.
Baby..
- And
why didn't you tell me
that your kids are my age?
I told you I have
a daughter and a son.
Do the math yourself.
I got separated 18 years ago.
Ishaan was three
and Ishika was seven.
7 plus 18 is 25.
You..
Just a little more time.
I love you.
Good morning, baby.
I thought it was you.
I am not your baby.
Why are you wearing
Ishika's night suit?
Because I didn't bring mine.
- Why?
Because I imagined that I'd be
sleeping in your room, next to you.
And not in Ishika's room,
next to her.
I am carrying what I
wear when I sleep with you.
Would you like me to wear that?
Calm down, baby.
What?
Is anybody around?
It's a bit weird.
Ishika's clothes.
Go to hell.
Don't worry. They will be here.
Please don't try
to be a part of this.
And I'm not worried
because of them.
They are here.
They are here.
Rishi did tell me
that you own cottages.
But I never imagined
anything like this, Manju.
This is a premium property.
How big is this property?
Atul, that's Ishika's grandfather.
Hello. Hello.
- And that's her grandmother.
Hello.
- Bless you.
And that's Ashish, my brother.
Ishika's uncle.
You didn't tell me that
her uncle's coming as well.
Rishi's aunt wanted
to come along too.
We had a hard time
explaining to her.
That this is just a family meeting.
Which made her angry.
She said, 'Am I not family?'
She is very close to Rishi.
If we had known,
we would've brought her along too.
It was a surprise visit.
He lives in London
and just arrived yesterday.
Ishika, wasn't your
dad's name Ashish as well?
Yes. Coincidence.
Just a coincidence.
But you never told me, so..
It's not something
to hide or tell.
We never spoke about uncle,
so I never told you.
Did you tell him about your father?
She doesn't have
many memories about him
since he died at an early age.
Did your family come along too?
They would if he had one.
He abandoned them long ago.
Dad.
He's separated.
Hello. Hello. Hello, everyone.
Sir.
He's our neighbour.
VK.
Young lad.
Apples from our orchard.
Totally organic.
Actually, he's not a neighbour,
he's a customer.
He's on holiday and is
staying in the cottage.
Bless you.
He's like your uncle too.
What are you saying?
I admit we're close, but
there's nothing like that.
And you?
Are you Ishika's friend or..
She is his secretary.
She travels everywhere with him.
Ayesha.
Why did we leave your aunt behind..
Anyway..
- You two get some rest first.
We can talk later.
So, Manju,
how do you want to do it?
Let's do it the way
these two want to do it.
Fine, they can do it
any way they want to.
But just do it.
Big or small destination,
whatever they want.
I don't think delaying
too much is a good idea.
Yes, but what's the hurry?
I mean, we just wanted
all of you to meet first
so that everyone's satisfied.
But why delay it?
Actually, we were thinking of
living together
for some time before.
Are you two unsure?
We're not unsure.
It's just that we don't
want to lie to ourselves.
We know we want to
spend our lives together..
But that's absurd.
It's out of the question, dear.
I think they are sure
about their love for each other
but they only spend
a few hours together.
And there's a big difference
between spending some time together
and living together for a lifetime.
Often there's love,
but no compatibility.
And live-in is not
a big deal nowadays.
If they live together before
marriage
they will only get
to know each other better.
Ashish, we are not in London.
What else is there to know?
If they don't know much about
each other, then why are we here?
Exactly. You're absolutely right.
After living all those years
in London, he's lost his mind.
Live-in is legal in India as well.
And what is your problem?
What do you think they will do now
which they haven't already done?
In fact, if they live in together
they will have a better
understanding of each other.
Stop talking nonsense.
Think before you speak.
What are you guys saying?
It's a good thing that
the children are smart.
Right.
You and the kids are
the only smart ones.
Ashish.
You shouldn't be giving advice
about relationships and marriage.
Would you have said the same
thing if she was your daughter?
Yes, I would have.
Then thank God this is not
about your daughter, but hers.
Excuse me.
Atul, I didn't know the children
had something like this in mind.
Can we continue this
discussion tomorrow?
I'll talk to Ishika as well.
Are you okay?
The kids are being sensible.
They knew
what their reaction would be.
And yet they mustered
the courage to say it.
At least give it a thought
before rejecting the idea.
What's going on for generations
doesn't have to be right
and what's new is wrong.
Let's order a hit on his father.
We'll pick him up.
End of problems.
If someone upsets my boss,
and I do nothing about it
then what kind of a
secretary does that make me?
I wonder what kind
of a mess I made!
I'll go take a look.
Manju must be cleaning it up.
He wanted to see who I am marrying.
So why didn't he just do that?
Why did he have to open his mouth?
Why did you have to get into it?
Couldn't you have stayed quiet?
But I was only trying
to support you.
I don't need your support.
This is my life and
I can take care of myself.
Can we talk?
Go on, I'll join you.
It's not easy.
You can't suddenly come,
and you know..
I know.
She wants to do the right thing.
You should support her.
That's what I do.
She is not afraid to express
her views
of being called wrong.
She won't listen.
My daughter.
Atul, I spoke with Ishika.
I explained to her.
They both work in the same city.
They don't live with us.
They can meet whenever they want.
As long as they live separately.
And then, whether they spend
their days together, or nights
there is no need to tell us.
They can live together
without our knowledge.
We are their parents.
They can keep that
much from us.
Right?
Shall we get them engaged?
Then they can live together.
We'll try to understand them,
they will try to understand us.
How do you do it, Manju?
Fine, let's get them engaged.
And when they are sure that
they can tolerate each other
and won't run away,
then we'll get them married.
Cheers.
Cheers, Atul.
Welcome. Welcome.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Dad, Atul just gave
me a fantastic idea.
Let's get them engaged,
and then they can live together.
If you guys don't
have a problem with it.
Atul, we're too old
to understand any of this.
But we trust her.
What are you doing?
Just making breakfast.
Thought I should eat something
healthy for a change.
Why are you cooking?
She wants to eat something healthy.
Because she's been eating
unhealthy food for two days now.
What are you going to eat?
Are you in the mood
for something healthy too
or will you eat what we are eating?
Whatever everyone's eating.
What's for breakfast?
Lentils stuffed 'Parathas'.
She's intentionally
trying to mess with me
I am telling you.
No, she isn't.
What did you tell her?
Oh..
So now you want to
know what I said to her.
No. - I am telling you she's
trying to mess with me
and now you stay out of it.
Well, there's nothing much
you can do.
Go ahead and stuff
your face with lentils.
But if she takes a jab at me again,
I will show her.
"I met her on the way."
"I met her on the way."
"What I was afraid of,
has happened."
"You, with the crooked hat.."
"You, innocent man.."
"You, with the crooked hat.."
"You, innocent man.."
They don't make such songs anymore.
Like the ones in our generation.
Which generation?
There are three generations here.
Mom and dad's.
Yours and mine.
And then the kids like Ishika,
Ishaan and Ayesha's.
Which generation
are you talking about?
You know, Ayesha, we were still
in college when this song came out.
Ashu used to hear it on repeat.
I am sure you weren't
even born back then.
I've heard this song on
Retro Special.
But seriously, were you really
in college when this song came out?
Are you that old?
How old are you?
She doesn't look a day older
than 35.
47.
She does.
26.
Ayesha is 26.
I found out.
Good night.
Weren't you only 20 years old
when you met mom?
Grandpa got married
at the age of 19.
Any career plans yet?
I look after the resort.
And now I am thinking
of settling down.
Thank you, Dad.
I knew you wouldn't show up empty
handed after my 21st birthday.
Dad?
This is still here?
Yes.
I take it out for a spin sometimes.
Does it still work?
Smooth as ever.
Our first car.
Let's go for a drive.
Come.
Let's go.
Whatever one might say,
nothing beats your first car.
You feel so comfortable driving it.
You know, Ayesha
we bought this car on our wedding.
It's been so many years, but
it still runs like it always did.
Right, Ashu?
- Yes.
They really built them well
back then.
Right?
Durable, reliable, faithful.
Right, Ashu?
- Yes.
And still stable as ever.
See.
Yes, but one needs to
upgrade from time to time.
Nostalgia is one thing
but the features grow
old over a period of time.
The body grows old,
doesn't look attractive anymore
the engine rusts.
And it cannot be compared with
the comfort, joy
and excitement of the new one.
And on top of that, the old
ones need extra maintenance.
And the new one
comes with a warranty.
Right, Ashu sir?
We did buy a new one.
Worked fine for a year.
But then something or the
other needed to be repaired.
We spent a fortune
on its maintenance.
Let's just say, the money
we spent on that car in one year
was more than what we have spent
on this one till now.
Right, Ashu?
No..
I mean, yes.
Old has its own place.
And the new has its own
advantages.
What advantages?
Better suspension.
Better looks.
And better safety.
No, you can't beat the
old in terms of safety.
Back then we had no such thing as
airbags, but it still kept us safe.
Us, the kids.
Most importantly,
it has never broken down midway.
Right, Ashu?
What's wrong, Manju?
Did you sprain your back?
Why don't you let Ashu sir
give you a massage?
He's really good.
Ashu, will you give me a massage?
Sure.
Let's go.
You are really good.
Where did you learn?
Dated a masseuse for a while.
So, is it a part of
every employee's package?
How much do you commit every month?
One massage a month,
or two, or maybe only on weekends.
Or is it only reserved
for the young..
Manju, we were travelling
and she got hurt.
That's it.
A little more to the left.
Ashu, a little below.
Yes.
Here?
- Yes, there.
Don't be shy, Ashu.
Nothing you haven't touched before.
I know, I am not being shy.
Oh, wow!
Thanks, Ayesha.
- Welcome.
Doesn't matter what Ishika says,
but I love you, Dad.
I love you too.
Dad, I need to talk to you.
No.
I never asked you for anything,
just this once.
No.
I am in love with Ayesha.
No.
Wow, Dad, this feels so good.
I love Ayesha.
Not possible.
But why?
Because she is my employee,
and it's against company rules.
But after she says yes,
she will settle down in India.
End of problem.
Not possible.
I know, five years age
difference is too much..
It's not about the age difference.
What are you saying, Dad?
It's important for age difference
to be minimal in a relationship.
Otherwise,
things only get complicated.
What gets complicated?
How does age difference matter?
Love is important.
Micheal Douglas and
Catherine Zeta-Jones.
George Clooney and his wife.
Saif and Kareena.
So you admit it's possible.
I said it's not possible.
Ishika is right.
You don't deserve
to be called a father.
You..
I didn't know
you were also into bikes..
What's going on?
'Rakhi'.
Manju, are you ready
with your platter?
Aren't you going to
tie a 'Rakhi' to your brother?
'Rakhi' is only for the kids.
Not for..
- You are being too modern.
This festival is the
foundation of sibling love.
And since you're here,
why not go ahead with it!
This is why he's here.
I told you he gave her a surprise.
This is how he surprised her.
Manju, set up the platter.
Sibling love doesn't
need the seal of 'Rakhi'.
We..
- Shut up!
I said shut up!
Stop this nonsense.
And go get the gift
you brought for Manju.
The gift can be given later, Dad.
And I'll use Ishika's platter.
Ishika, you and Ishaan go first.
Good idea.
We are committing a sin.
Let her tie it.
Doesn't make a difference to us.
Because if he doesn't,
then Atul will wonder
why the brother isn't
letting his sister tie the 'Rakhi'.
The mother will tie 'Rakhi' to
her husband in front of the kids?
Come, Manju.
Wait a minute.
Hasmukh. Go and fetch
my guitar right away.
Of course.
Let's set the mood.
He's celebrating 'Rakhi'
after all these years.
It's a big day.
It's wrong. It's just wrong.
That was the last 'Rakhi'.
We bought only one.
Only one?
Anyway, Manju, our love
doesn't depend on some thread.
What emotion! Wow!
But don't worry.
I am there.
Do you carry 'Rakhis'
in your pocket?
Such opportunities come
only once in a lifetime, ma'am.
The other hand.
The right one, not the left.
"Even the sun, moon, and stars say"
"my sister's one-in-a-million."
"We're going to stay
together forever and ever."
"Even the sun, moon,
and stars say.."
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
Great weather, fresh air, sunlight
we're on a picnic here,
aren't we, sir?
Let's go check the prices
of potatoes and onion.
Oh! Sir, fresh tomatoes.
Can I buy a dozen of them?
I'll make some juice for you.
Great for health.
- Stop it, Ayesha.
At least tell me what's wrong.
Well, for starters,
I became your secretary.
Without me realizing, I got into
a competition with your ex-wife
about who knows Ashish better.
All this while I thought you wanted
to introduce me to your family
when actually you
wanted their approval.
Ayesha, I didn't know that
Ishika is getting married.
I'll sort things out
as soon as they leave.
No way you'll sort things out.
You let your children's
mother tie you a 'Rakhi'.
And you still claim
you'll sort things out.
"My dad says
I'll achieve something in life."
"That his son will be successful."
"But no one knows where
my destiny will lead me."
Let it be, dear. She will manage.
Uncle, mom's calling you.
Atul, I've tasted potatoes
all over the world, but
nothing like Manju's potatoes.
Only organic is good.
Seriously, Manju
thank you for
making me a better man.
"You have made me complete"
"otherwise I would've
always remained incomplete."
"While walking amongst the crowd"
"I would've sailed down
a different path altogether."
"I would've been incomplete."
Wow! On which truck
did you read that?
Brother..
Manju, your brother is here?
You were going to take
me for the local wine tasting.
Let's go.
Let's avoid it in front
of the kids.
They are at an impressionable age,
especially her son.
I know that all of us drink.
In fact, I personally offered
Rishi his first beer.
So that he's aware of the
effects when he's drinking outside.
He's their uncle,
he won't understand.
They meet only once a year.
The parents have to take
care of them all the while.
Absolutely.
Those who come over once in a while
won't know a thing about
children's responsibility.
Right?
I'll be right back.
You embarrassed him.
Yes, I'm the one who embarrassed.
The distillery guys called.
Can we discuss the points?
- Yes. They're on my phone.
We can discuss it now.
Come on.
Tell me honestly how important
Manju's approval is for you.
I am not looking for her approval.
I just want you to get
to know her and the kids.
Kids.
These kids?
Ishika looks like my older sister.
And that Ishaan..
Do you know what
Ishaan was saying to me?
'Your name ends at 'Isha'
and mine begins with it.'
'If we add an 'L', it will become
'Alishaan' (grand).'
Go ahead.
What do I say to him?
'Dear, I am here to become
your mom and not your wife.'
Ishika doesn't look older than you.
I love you!
"O sweetheart, your
eyes are miniature."
"Just two sips were enough
to raise my temperature."
"O sweetheart, your
eyes are miniature."
"Just two sips were enough
to raise my temperature."
"You got me all high."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight.."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"Stop bragging like this."
"All the heroes of
Bollywood hit on me."
"When I move my waist"
"it's a treat for many eyes."
"When I move my waist"
"it's a treat for many eyes."
"You should thank Lord that such
a great guy's crazy about you."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight.."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"But your very sight.."
"But your very sight.."
"But your very sight.."
"But your very sight.."
"Every night you call me"
"and say you've brought a ring."
"Every night you call me"
"and say you've brought a ring."
"He had to say no,
but he said yes to me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"I don't know how your heart is,
but your very sight floored me."
"But your very sight.."
"But your very sight.."
Ishika, calm down.
I will not calm down.
Do not ask me to calm down.
Ask this man to leave.
Come inside. Let's go inside and..
This man is a liar.
He lied when he said he
will always be there for me.
He lied when he left
and said nothing will change.
'Everything will be fine.
I will make everything right.'
And he's still lying.
She is not his secretary.
And even if she is, then
these two are having an affair.
She is not my secretary.
I came here to introduce
her to all of you.
But my intentions..
- Please don't say anything.
I beg of you.
You are a liar!
And I will not be a liar like you!
I won't lie.
You don't lie to your kin.
You don't cheat on them.
Regardless of how good
your intentions are.
Rishi, he's not my uncle.
He's my father.
My parents separated
when I was young.
I kept lying to you because
honestly, he was dead to me.
And when he suddenly showed up
I was scared to tell you the truth.
I am sorry.
Manju, I was beginning
to respect you.
So I won't say much.
And there isn't much to say.
But this won't be possible for me.
I can't get into the details, but
this doesn't seem right for Rishi.
Rishi, I am waiting in the car.
Pintu.
Keep her luggage in the cottage.
Why did you come
here in the first place?
Why?
She is as old as Ishika.
Don't you feel ashamed?
What did you think?
You will drop in unannounced
introduce your girlfriend
as your secretary
we will start liking her
and tell you to marry her?
Why can't you ever do
anything right?
I told you to send him back.
I told you he shouldn't be here,
but you never listen.
Will you just shut up?
You two broke up
because of your lie.
Not because of him.
And we broke up because of us,
not just him.
When we separated,
you had to choose between one of us
so that you could
justify our separation.
And maybe I was really happy that
you all thought he was wrong
and chose me over him.
But when two people separate
only they know why
they are separating.
And why is divorce
such a big issue?
Rather than dragging a relationship
all your life, blaming each other
it's better to separate.
And try a new life.
Did he share a bond only with you?
What about us?
When did he leave us, Dad?
You chose me.
He didn't even try to fight it.
And he brought Ayesha
here because he still cares.
He could've just sent a picture
saying this is my new wife.
And as for the kids
kids inherit their parents'
property, money, status.
Similarly, they inherit
their broken relationships.
If they reap the rewards
of our right decisions
then they will have
to tolerate our mistakes as well.
All I know is, at the age
of getting his daughter married
he's marrying
someone who's as old as..
You wouldn't have
minded if she was my age?
Weren't married couples
10 to 15 years apart in your time?
In fact, some couples
would even be 25 years apart.
Back then girls had no option.
But they both want to be together.
Frankly, all this is pointless.
This is his life. And he can live
it the way he wants to.
We need to stop blaming
him for everything.
He isn't responsible
for this broken relationship
nor was he for ours!
I wanted to say something.
Please don't get me wrong.
Rather than starting a new life
maybe it's time
you complete this one.
And trust me
if you feel for even a moment
that this is what you want to do
and this is where you want to be
then I'll understand.
Get some sleep.
I'll go and meet Manju.
Thank you.
I didn't come here to..
- I know.
I am sorry.
I am tired.
I am tired
of always being
the responsible one.
Why should I always
be the sensible one?
Why should I
understand every time?
For once,
I want to not care about anyone!
For once..
All I want is one day when
I don't have to worry about anyone.
Why can't..
Why can't I just be?
Shit.
I am tired, Ashu.
I know.
Don't worry.
Don't tell her.
She won't be able to understand.
You didn't come back last night.
I sat down to talk to Manju.
Is she fine?
What's wrong?
Last night
Manju and I..
We slept together.
Slept together,
as in on the same bed?
Ayesha, what are you doing?
I should leave.
I told you, if you
want to stay with Manju..
It isn't that.
It didn't mean anything.
We are not getting back together.
What do you mean?
I mean, it just happened.
It didn't mean anything.
If you don't want to get back to
her, then why are you telling me?
What?
I mean, what did you want
to achieve by telling me?
What am I going to
do with this information?
You shouldn't have told me.
What are you saying, Ayesha?
We're going to get married.
I think you deserve to know.
I deserve to know.
I deserve to know.
You know what I deserve?
I deserve that you shouldn't
have slept with her.
I told you not to tell her.
Manju, we're solving this.
Wow, she said don't tell me.
Nice.
So you two even discussed
whether to tell me or not.
We didn't discuss anything.
She just said..
- Said what?
Don't tell her,
she won't understand.
Yes, how would I understand?
Because you two are the
only sensible people around.
You do understand, then?
Of course, I do.
What did you understand?
- Manju, why don't you understand?
Don't over-react.
It just happened.
And it didn't happen
for the first time.
It's happened thousands of times.
How do you think
these kids were born?
Seriously?
Is she crazy?
What is she saying?
If you were in my shoes and he had
cheated on you with another woman
would you have explained
the same thing to yourself?
He didn't cheat.
Technically,
you are the other woman.
I am still his wife.
We are not divorced.
You told me you are divorced.
I told you we are separated.
Not divorced?
- I mean, actually
I also just realized that.
We never felt the need,
so we never signed the papers.
And since it's been so long,
the thought never crossed my mind.
And I swear, nothing has happened
between us in the last 15 years.
Honestly, it's just a technicality.
So technically,
you are still married
and last night
you slept with your wife.
And I am the other woman.
Lovely.
Ayesha..
- Please shut up.
You are older, and everyone made
me feel I am much younger to you.
But I never felt it around you.
But today you made me feel
smaller than
I've ever felt in my life.
I feel I am just a small
anecdote in your life
who mistook herself to be a story.
"You are not a part of my life"
"and I don't know why."
"You are not a part of my life"
"and I don't know why."
"All I know is I'm your wrong"
"and you are my right."
"Without you,
life's full of sorrows"
"life feels burdened."
"You seem to be fading
away from my life more than ever."
"My heart's weeping"
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."
"My heart's weeping"
"drowned in your memories."
"Life without you moves on"
"but I don't feel alive anymore."
"Two hearts that agree, but"
"destiny is against us."
"Life without you moves on"
"but I don't feel alive anymore."
"Two hearts that agree, but"
"destiny is against us."
"The tears of love
convey our story."
"Everyone sinks close to the shore"
"but some make it across."
"My heart's weeping"
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."
"My heart's weeping"
"drowned in your memories."
I know I am not a good father.
I don't know if what
I did was right or wrong.
I don't know whether it's true
or false.
But I do know that
my daughter is crying.
I can either do it the easy way
or the hard way.
"Your daughter yearns for"
"your finger and your arms."
"Your daughter yearns for"
"your shoulders to sit on."
"Resting her head on your chest,
swinging in your arms"
"your tickling.."
"Your daughter yearns"
"to hold your hands."
"Your daughter yearns.."
"Your daughter yearns.."
Thank you.
Don't be crazy.
She is my daughter too.
My entire life will
be spent in thanking you.
That's true.
Do you miss her?
I am not some 16-year-old
to miss her.
No, you're not. Still
you're standing here like this.
Hence, I am asking.
Yes, I do miss her.
You do know that 10 years later
she will still be young
and you won't be in
a position to do anything.
And she won't have any option
other than cheating on you.
You..
"When you're not my companion"
"the paths are filled
with hurdles."
"Without you, even peace
and sleep have abandoned me."
"I don't know how these
rifts crept up between us."
"Without you,
my heart feels empty."
"Without you,
life's full of sorrows"
"life feels burdened."
"You seem to be fading
away from my life more than ever."
"My heart's weeping"
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."
"My heart's weeping"
"drowned in your memories."
"My heart's weeping"
"sitting in the corner
of the eyes."
"My heart's weeping."
"My heart's weeping."
Sorry, the bar is closed.
I am the mother of his children.
He loves me a lot.
Not in the same way he loves you.
But he loves me to the extent
that he couldn't say no that day.
He wasn't cheating on you.
He was only supporting me.
He didn't become weak
in my weak moment.
Maybe because of
the guilt of leaving me
he couldn't walk out on me again.
Just understand that he
had a responsibility towards me
which he has now fulfilled.
I've started the divorce process.
He is still yours.
You just have to believe it.
I know it's hard to accept, but..
Is sleeping together
once enough to fall in love?
Then how can it be
enough to fall out of it?
Have you two taken a pledge that
at any given point of time, only
one of you will act responsibly?
Where is mom?
Ishika, she said that
she's just going away for a day
and that I should
take care of things.
Now, if she's going
away only for a day
why would I ask where and why?
I can't wait.
I am getting on with my engagement.
You're so selfish.
Won't you wait for
the mother who raised you?
I am selfish.
Ishika..
You have no shame at all, do you?
You sent your ex-wife
to convince me?
We aren't divorced yet.
Why did you call me back?
I am ready to do
everything all over again.
Visit the same places again.
Make the same mistakes again.
Have the same arguments again.
Even convince you again.
Choose our song again.
Think of a pet name again.
Tell the same lies again.
Endure every taunt again.
Laugh on the same jokes again.
Cry for the same sorrows again.
Without you,
life already feels lived and stale.
Let me live once again.
With you.
I know
it's a very emotional moment.
And that was a great dialogue.
But please, let's go.
You too. I mean, please get ready.
But I don't have any clothes.
I'll lend you mine. Wear those.
Cheers!
Look, your new mother.
How are you going
to look at her now?
How will you live now?
Grandpa, stop ragging me.
- I am not ragging you.
Your own father..
You got what you wanted.
Now put in a good word for me too.
I can't help you.
Keep trying.
Now?
Manju, how do you manage all this?
Atul..
Your competition.
Finally, everything is sorted.
So when do you want to do it?
What do you mean?
Do I look like an orphan?
Don't I have a family?
Seeing the mess here,
I am scared to even think
what will happen at my place.
What?
I mean I'll have to
introduce you to them.
I am not coming. - You'll have to
come over to my house.
Why not?
- Your family is crazy.
How can I?
- My family is crazy?
Didn't I come all the way here?
- Never..
Isn't your family crazy?
- My family's so nice..
What are you saying?
Your son was hitting on me.
Forget it..
- I did so much.
"I want to hear you!"
"I'm a bad girl and
I am a little naughty."
"I am the life of every party."
"I don't shy away from anything"
"and today I've
had a little Bacardi."
"I'm all decked up for you today."
"I am not going to
stop dancing today."
"Beware, boy"
"as my moves light up the party."
"Slowly-Slowly.."
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
"and don't sprain your waist."
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
"and don't sprain your waist."
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
don't sprain your waist."
"Yes, baby."
"When you sway your
waist up and down"
"my heart skips a beat."
"Through your eyes,
you say yes, no, maybe."
"But I know your heart's
reserved for me."
"You dance at the club so
graciously"
"I can't take my eyes off you."
"When you wear red bangles
with your red dress"
"the boys lose their heart."
"I'm all decked up for you today."
"I am not going to
stop dancing today."
"Beware, boy"
"as my moves light up the party."
"Slowly-Slowly.."
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
"and don't sprain your waist."
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
"and don't sprain your waist."
"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
"don't sprain your waist"
"Yes, baby."
"I'm a bad girl and
I am a little naughty."
"I am the life of every party."
"I don't shy away from anything"
"and today I've
had a little Bacardi."
"I'm all decked up for you today."
"I am not going to
stop dancing today."
"Beware, boy"

"Slowly-Slowly.."
"Slowly-Slowly sway

"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"

"Slowly-Slowly sway
to the beat, honey"
"don't sprain your waist."
"Yes, baby."
