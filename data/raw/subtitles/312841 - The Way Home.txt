Is she deaf?
No.
She can't talk?
Stop asking me.
Then, she won't bug me like you.
Is she scary?
No.
How old is she?
Don't ask.
Damn it.
Nice chicken!
It's so big!
Let's go.
Hurry!
I don't like it here.
I'm not going,
I don't wanna go.
Come here!
You pest!
- Why'd you hit me?
You pest!
Let's go!
THE WAY HOME
This is Sang-Woo, your grandson.
I'm sorry I never visited...
I've been having a hard time.
His father?
We split up ages ago.
I was only 17 when we ran off,
so now what can I do?
It's so hard to find
a job these days.
I'll find one as fast as I can.
I had a shop,
but I lost it.
Only got debt now.
It'll be two months at most.
I'll come back after I find a job.
He's used to being alone,
so he won't cause trouble.
Sang-woo, say hi
to your grandma.
No!
Don't be rude!
She's dirty.
This is some underwear.
And nourishment for the elderly.
Those are Sang-woo's.
He'll just eat them on his own.
I better catch the last bus.
No!
No, I can't!
I have to go today.
Listen to your grandma,
and be a good boy.
Got it?
Ouch!
Retard!
Dummy!!
Stupid mute!
Deaf retard!
What're you looking at?
Where are you going?
Hello!
How are you?
My mom wanted
you to have some.
Is he your grandson from Seoul?
My house is down there.
Come over and we'll play.
Come on, let me see it!
Go, you mutt!
Scavenger, find solex!
Hanul, look out!
Scavenger is here.
Don't worry.
Cubix is here.
Cubix! Let's go!
Fly away!
A bug!
Bug spray!
Where's the spray?
Kill it!
Don't you see?
Kill it!
There it is!
Hurry, it's running away!
Not there! Over there!
Oh, gross!
Come on, hurry up!
Kill it!
Hurry and kill it!
Take it away! Kill it!
What if it comes back? Kill it!
Don't let it go!
This is so annoying.
What's wrong?
Why isn't it working?
I need batteries!
Give me money!
I need batteries!
Give me money!
Give me money,
I'll tell mom to pay you back.
I can't play my game
without battery.
Stupid.
You're no help!
<Retard! >
No, don't!
Dirty feet... Cubix...
Rock, scissors, paper.
Rock.
Rock.
Damm it...
Hello!
Hello! Can you hear me?
What?
Where can I buy batteries?
I can't hear you.
Come here.
Batteries! Batteries!
Batteries?
- Yes!
Come here!
Go down this road,
and there's a school.
Keep going straight.
Then you'll find a gate.
Go past the gate,
and there's a small shop.
What are you looking for?
Batteries.
Go this way, that way,
and then that way.
I don't get it.
Go this way, that way,
and that way, then straight.
<Hardware Store>
Where are you going?
What?
What do I want to eat?
You don't even have money...
Pizza, Hamburger
Kentucky Chicken!
See?
You don't know anything.
Wait a sec!
Look.
This is pizza.

That's right!
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
A chicken!!
That's right!
A chicken!
Hurry back! I wait for you!
You liar!
This isn't Kentucky chicken!
This sucks!

Fried!
Why is it in the water?
You don't know anything!
This sucks.
Kentucky chicken!

Cheol-yee! Run harder!
The crazy cow is coming!
Watch out!
Run harder!
Run harder! Run harder!
Run! Run faster!
Don't let it catch you!
Great job!
That was great!
Can't you say sorry?
Step away!
You spoiled my meal.
I know how to make it, too.
I don't care!
I'm not playing house with you.
A dummy like you
will never get married.
There's gonna be more girls
than boys when we get older.
Too bad for you.
Can you cook Kentucky chicken?
No but I can eat it.
Is Cheol-yee your boy friend?
Why?
Is the bus really coming?
Off to sell pumpkins?
They look great.
You really grew them well.
How did you do it?
We can't do it that well.
Please give me a hand!
Your cabbages look really fresh.
Yeah, they sure are.
