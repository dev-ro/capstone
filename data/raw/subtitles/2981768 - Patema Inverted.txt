We are different beings from you.
Yet you want us to cooperate with things like you?
What's your objective?
Unfortunately you're an impurity.
No one would want to live where people like you exist.
Descendants of the sinners,
get devoured by the sky.
JNMBS
PRESENTS
One-two.
Ah! Man...
Princess Patema! What are you doing?
What is this?
We found these in a storage room in the lower levels.
They're vaccuum packed!
We found some new types too.
That's amazing!
Looks like we might be able to expand the plant next term.
I'll report this to the deputy chief.
Don't forget to follow the safety guidelines, okay?
Okay!
Bye-bye!
Okay!
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
Okay!
Bye-bye!
Hmph.
Entering a girl's room on your own is not something a gentleman would do.
We're guardians, not gentlemen.
No, I'm a gentleman!
Be quiet, you.
Isn't it nice to go home from somewhere else from time to time?
Ah-
You went to the danger zone again, didn't you?
What's so dangerous?
It's against the law!
I mean, it's wonderful over there!
The place I found today was so huge!
It's completely different compared to a place like this.
I know I have to cherish this way of living,
but I also want to know about different places.
Are these the words of the chief's daughter?
Now, now gramps...
Are these the words of the chief's daughter?
Now, now gramps...
If it was Lagos,
then he wouldn't have said such a thing.
Ah! The danger zone, you know, has monsters!
The, uh... Bat Humanoids!
If it touches you,
you won't ever be able to come home.
T-the heck is that. I'm not a kid anymore.
You're lying right?
Rather than a bat...
Either way! Like the chief said,
become a role model for everyone.
Porta.
Yeah, yeah.
Porta.
Yeah, yeah.
Geez, going off and saying too much.
Well they really wander that place right?
Your voice is too loud!
Isn't it better if we just tell her?
I feel like if we don't tell her,
it'll come back to bite us in the ass.
Patema is still a kid!
Geez. I'm just joking.
We have to live by the rules and standards right?
We live for her.
"Lagos wouldn't have said such a thing," huh?
Well, I guess that is the case.
He's not a depths-dweller anymore!
How many years have passed since he last contacted us?
Nobody knows where he is.
Come in.
Have you been well, Patema?
You got in a fight with Gramps again.
You heard us, huh?
Where did you go off to?
You heard us, huh?
Where did you go off to?
We're not done talking, Lagos!
Are you gonna leave again?
Yeah. This time I might be a bit longer.
Why do you go outside so much?
Stay with me forever.
You know, I want to know a different world from this one.
I want to have a deep understanding of that world.
I guess it might be too confusing for you right now.
Then, take me with you.
Grow up a bit more, okay?
I'm not the problem.
It's just a bit more.
Be a good girl and wait.
If you promise to do so,
I have a present for you today too.
Look. Beautiful right?
You're not a child anymore right?
Patema, close your eyes.
It's really old but it's definitely something to be treasured.
This is the world.
Now, open your eyes.
Have I waited enough, Labos?
What am I, stupid?
Should I go home?
Just kidding.
A bat humanoid!
I'm not scared...
I have to make sure I don't fall.
Um...
What's happening to you?
Help me!
Huh?
Don't let me fall!
Fall, you say... Where?
Why are you asking something so obvious?
Huh?
It's the same as Lagos' picture.
Lagos! This is a joke right?
Oh! Are you inverted?
"Inverted?"
Just... Just... Just what is this place?
That thing and this thing are all hanging from above!
Well, to me you're the odd one out.
What? Even you're hanging from the—
What?
A bat humanoid...
That's it! You're one of their allies, right?
Huh?
I mean, they're inverted too!
No, slow down...
Why is something this horrible happening?
No, slow down...
Why is something this horrible happening?
Wait... Wait a sec...
Why is something this horrible happening?
Wait... Wait a sec...
Release me!
I said wait!
Did I do anything bad to you?
Well, you know...
I won't do such things.
I never will.
Just because you're inverted...
Sorry. Even though you helped me...
Did you get attacked by someone?
What should I do?
I...
What's that?!
Not good. I have to go back.
Huh?
I have classes.
Wai—Stop! I command you to wait.
Wait, please!
You're going to leave me alone?
Well, I have to go to school.
There's citizenship qualifiers, and we're getting monitored...
Between me and school, which is more important?
Don't worry! I'll come back.
For sure?
Sure.
Don't leave me alone, okay?
I got it...
Don't tell the bat humanoids!
Sure.
Lastly, I'm hungry!
You're quite the princess.
That's right. I don't want someone like you saying it.
I'm Eiji. What would you like to be called?
Patema!
Amazing! I flew!

0830—Use education hall #2 to find the right classroom.
Once before, this world was struck by a huge tragedy,
and countless lives were taken by the sky.
in other words, we Aigans that stand the right way are the true humans.
Aiga is the absolute lone world for humans to live in.
There is no world outside of Aiga.
We watch our own footsteps,
and by following regulations, we must continue protecting this great land.
From endless land away from these cliffs,
as well as the ominous sky taking in devouring evil light we—
That's 3 demerit points, Eiji. Do you know why?
I was listening.
I see.
However, the problem is that your gaze is turned towards a bad direction.
As usual, your brain's inverted.
Does anyone know why Aigans can have such ideal livelihoods?
What's wrong? Thanks to Eiji, we can have a discussion until the end morning assembly.
Because everyone keeps law and order by pointing our eyes at the great earth.
That's about it.
Law and order are more valuable than anything else.
Were you unable to return to the dorm last night, Eiji?
A person that with his steps retrieve—
Are you listening?
You better not think that as long as you have attendance,
 you can get qualified to be a citizen!
Geez. He and his dad are something else.
However, Eiji, I won't abandon you.
You're also an asset to this country in the future.
What happened to your dad was certainly unfortunate.
However, you shouldn't keep living in the past.
That's what I think.
Excuse me.
What?
There's no ongoing regulation that disallows looking at the sky.
To think I would have to refer to the 6th page.
Once before sinful people were taken into the sky.
How can you look directly at the sky where impure souls have floated to?
Falling into the sky is a sin, is it?
There's writing about it, is there not?
Abominable sinners they are.
Aiga is bad!
Tell the deputy chief!
...no way I could abandon her!
Uh... Patema?
You're late!
I was really bored!
Sorry! I was held back.
Here.
Smells good!
What a weird feeling.
If I eat this do I get lighter?
Patema, are you scared of the sky?
The sky? You mean what you're looking at right now?
Oh right. Yup. The sky.
Of course I am!
What about you?
Tonight there are stars out so I might... like it.
Stars?
You don't know that either, huh?
It should be obvious that I don't know anything about this world.
Say, do you want to see the stars?
No way!
Just a bit is fine.
I'm scared of that. Very much!
No matter what?
Absolutely not!
I see.
It's beautiful.
That's the first time I've heard you say that.
Well... It's really beautiful.
A lot more than the place I loved.
My dad told me...
Your dad?
That he loved this scenery.
He often talked about wanting to jump into the middle of it.
So in the end, he even made a vehicle to fly into the sky.
Fly? Just how?
I don't remember clearly.
I wonder why he flew?
You can just ask.
At the time he was supposed to jump, everyone around was against it.
They said it was an ominous love.
But there's no way that would be right.
That's why I skipped class
and went to go watch.
Everyone said it was divine punishment.
Why? Wasn't it amazing?
I totally empathize with your dad.
I mean, it's really beautiful.
This is the first time
 I've been glad to have come to this world.
Hmm... As you said, this is an inverted person.
Did she get eaten by the sky just like that?
Or maybe...
We discovered her around the top
of the education center and other related facilities
Raise the monitoring levels.
Don't overlook anything small.
Yes sir.
It looks like we'll finally be able to use
our companion's clue.
Just like you wanted,
we're going to be friendly.
So you're from under the earth's surface?
What's it like?
Compared to here, it's really cramped and dark.
That's why I wanted to go to some different world.
There's all sorts of things written in the book,
and Lagos showed me all sorts of pictures.
A rectangular, beautiful, small picture.
Lagos?
An important person.
Oh?
You don't like where you live either.
It's not that. Down there I have Gramps, Porta, and everyone's so nice.
They must be worried about me, right? I'm sure...
I'll definitely get you back to your family. I promise.
If so, then I'll introduce you to my family.
What's wrong?
Hide!
The food...
They found out, huh?
The food...
They found out, huh?
Bat humanoids!
Like the one that attacked me.
The security officers?
Why?
Why?!
Let's run,
Patema!
They've come to capture you!
But...
How do I do that?
Grab me!
But that's...
They always say,
those who fall towards the sky
are disgusting sinners.
Eiji do you think that?
You think I would?
It's okay.
From now on I'll be fine.
That's it!
Princess!
Lagos,
give me strength!
Here we go!
This height...
It's light!
Wait! Be more gentle!
For how heavy you are,
my lightness balances it!
You shouldn't say such things to a girl!
Eiji.
Eiji!
In front of you!
In front of you!
Patema,
You'll go back home to the depths.
We go to the other side of the fence, then jump off the cliff.
If we hold hands,
we should fall slowly.
Does that to mean fly with you?
To the other side of that fence.
The other side, you say...
W-wait a sec!
This will work!
Amazing!
It's working!
Unauthorized leave for 2 days,
unauthorized use of government warehouse,
restrained by security officer,
and worst of all, crossing the fence!
Even I was surprised.
Who would have expected someone like you to cause chaos.
What are you trying to do?
We, you know, are entrusted to take responsibility for your actions.
Hey, are you listening?
That attitude of yours
will reduce the effect of the educational centers.
Patema...
will reduce the effect of the educational centers.
Patema...
What did you say?
has been taken by those people...
I...
couldn't save her.
Spouting more nonsense.
Getting attacked by those two...
The ones that don't make sense are them!
Give me a break.
Back off.
The heck is this...
What you met is not a human.
If you want to live,
then forget all about her.
What?
You can leave the big problems to us.
Or could it be that you have an attachment to her?
You must have learned all about her womanhood.
I won't repeat myself.
I don't want both father and son
to have died because of an accident.
What do you plan to do to me?
Release me!
I hate this inverted world.
"Inverted." That's what you are.
Don't you think it's weird?
That you're hanging from the ceiling, that is.
It seems you don't know why inverted people are born.
Once before, an experiment was held in these lands.
A terrifying experiment using energy from gravity.
However, the laws of this world did not allow it.
The experiment failed
and the gravity of living things got reversed.
Even humans started flying towards the sky.
As our ancestors wanted,
In order to stop the same thing from happening,
this, Aiga, was realized.
To ultimately live in peace with law and order.
However, some people survived the accident
and became inverted people.
They abandoned living at the surface and hid underground.
How vexatious!
Aiga is a perfected world.
We over here, and you over there.
What would happen if the blood of the inverted were to mix with ours?
We are beings that are not allowed to be tainted.
People from Aiga are not allowed to be
swallowed by the sky like you sinners!
Sin? Just what...
I'll tell you about it too.
Inverted people appearing in Aiga is the start of everything.
This inverted person一ruins our national position
and breaches order as well.
Take a look.
Everything is inverted.
You inverteds are always hiding somewhere.
That man hid until the very end.
That, too, was all in vain!
If I drop you, it seems as if you'll die.
That's good.
You can rely on nobody other than me
when it comes to your life.
Crap!
W-wait!
You're Patema's friend, right?
You! You know Patema?
Where is she! Where'd you take her!
that was close...
My stomach is going crazy.
If it was Patema, then I would have been able to hold on.
Oh yeah! Where is she?
Hey! You know, right?
Say it!
Did she get caught by those guys?
What the hell?
You better not be lying!
We were together the whole time!
You just sat back and watched?
What the hell can I do?
Since your weight falls the other way, then...
Patema is in that tower?
Go down with me, you.
Just come!
Hey, he's back.
That was fast.
Okay, easy now.
One-two.
What's wrong?
For some reason... It's light.
Did he possibly fall?
Don't talk ill of people!
An Aigan...
Porta,
what have you done?
Shut up! We'll talk about it later.
Call Gramps!
It's a bat humanoid!
Did you bring anyone?
I understand.
Porta, what have you done?
Can't anyone find anything else to say to me?
Evreything's inverted.
The children didn't see, right?
Children?
The children must not learn about Aiga.
This is our duty.
We need to raise them properly.
Even now you talk about laws?
If those laws had been followed,
none of this would have happened!
They got Patema!
So it's true, huh?
It is, right?
Tell him where.
I think she's in the Administration Center.
A tower in Aiga!
The one that penetrates the danger zone.
Don't tell me you...
When I held onto this guy, we fell slowly.
Reason being that Aigans gravity are inverted too.
In other words... We can infiltrate them from there!
That violates the law, you hear?
These laws,  you say.
I've long since hated when you talk like that, Gramps!
What'd you say?!
Just who the hell made these laws?
You ingrate!
You picking a fight?
Is that a picture?
Yeah.
It's an Aigan belonging, ain't it?
That damn Lagos even showed her this much with a picture.
Is that Lagos Patema's boyfriend?
Wrong!
He was a weird guy that always went to Aiga!
His actions were surely mistaken,
going to such a frightful place.
What's so frightful about it?
Not being able to step on the ground is endlessly frightful.
You people don't understand.
The way we see the world is different, after all.
Patema must have hid feelings of fear.
No way! I mean, she said she was fine!
It looks like she's brave on the outside.
That's the kind of girl she is.
It was the same when the chief died.
Losing your one and only family member...
No.
She hid in her room and cried. I knew.
The heck is that?
An invert like you wouldn't understand,
a single thing about Patema.
That might be so...
I don't know. I wonder if I was never knew?
But... but, you see...
I was happy.
I mean, she said the stars were beautiful.
She also listened to me talking about my dad.
That was the first time I experienced something like that...
Yet, I...
When the time came, I couldn't do anything.
I didn't even think of going to save her.
I'll do anything,
I just ask that you lend me your strength!
Around here is called the danger zone.
Reason being that the tower reaches all the way down here.
Once before, I heard
that our clan coexisted with Aigans here.
Then, this place is...
the administration center's bottom?
Though these days, it's obsolete.
It's run out of uses, after all.
It goes this deep...
Though I don't know why this would be abandoned,
the chief once said,
"Aigans forget the past, in order to live."
No one really cares about this.
Thanks to this, we can easily infiltrate them.
We must prevent more Aigans from falling to the heavens.
If it comes down to a last resort...
Even if I'm the only one left,
I'll save Patema for sure.
That's my line, damn it!
You two need to cooperate as well.
I know!
I know!
Cooperating with an invert...
I could say the same.
Okay, lets go!
Don't let me fall!
Same here.
At last, I get to surpass the first generation of monarchs.
That girl's existence proves that there are a lot of inverts in hiding.
Sunako,
We should force the info out of the girl.
There's no need to rush.
First, let her feel that everything is in my hands.
As soon as she submits to me, she'll tell freely.
Worried?
No, it's nothing.
The way her face looks when she clings to me,
I want to see it again.
We've finished transferring the inverted girl.
Good work on the night shift.
But, why at the highest level?
In order to strike fear into the heart of the invert.
Crap. That means I can't go over there.
You go on ahead. I'll look for a different route.
Porta,
thanks.
I'll catch up with you soon.
So beautiful.
Save me... Eiji!
Sorry for leaving you alone.
Lagos...
I met your family.
I came here with Porta.
Really?
I promised right?
That I'll definitely return you to your family.
Eiji.
Let's jump from the roof.
No matter how high it is,
if I'm with you then I'm sure it'll be okay.
You let a kid infiltrate this place?
It seems he's cooperating with the inverted.
That so?
Go look for the others.
Let's go from the top.
Go.
Patema!
My foot is...
Let's hurry.
You do such unbelievable things.
Both father and son make such rebellious decisions.
How unsightly.
It wans't an accident, right?
Law and order are things
that Aigans do not dare destroy.
Like the inverted do.
Is it wrong to fly in the sky?
Such extravagant things are not needed!
You're scared!
Just like my dad said...
If you can fly in the sky,
you'll understand just how small of a world Aiga is.
You're all just scared to find out!
I flew! Together with Patema!
Unfortunately, you won't even see what awaits this girl.
Kill him.
But...
Did you not hear me?
Come in.
Have you been well, Patema?
You got in a fight with Gramps again!
You heard us, huh?
Where did you go off to?
I'm not done talking to you, Lagos!
Are you going to leave again?
Yeah. This time, I won't be back.
I went to Aiga, and there...
Stay here forever.
I had a dream, that's why I went to Aiga.
But I was unable to make it come true.
That's why I'm entrusting this to
someone important to me.
Lagos...
That's why, no matter what, don't let go of him.
Got it?
Eiji! Eiji!
Porta!
Patema... Patema is...
Eiji, that light...
Don't let go!
It'll be okay.
The stars.
Is this my...
From the time I was falling.
Eiji?
Eiji.
This is...
my dad's vehicle.
Eventually all sinners get devoured by the sky, huh?
To think she would pick that kid over me...
Why didn't she pick me?!
Jack.
Tell them that kid got in an accident.
Understood.
Let this be a warning to the others.
Eiji?
I was scared.
Whenever I looked down, my mind went blank.
You'll be fine here.
Up until now I thought I understood your feelings.
That's why I thought I had to protect you.
But I didn't understand,
that being upside down is this scary.
Your dad made this, right?
This is the only thing I find strange...
Look.
Like I thought, It's my dad's handwriting.
What's written on there?
It's hard to read upside down.
September 23一
Something amazing happened today!
I met a strange man who said, "I come from the world below."
As unbelievable as it is,
he claims gravity operates in exactly
the opposite direction as ours for him.
I'm hiding the man named Lagos,
from the other humans.
I can't let those people find out about him.
I'm sure his appearance has to mean something.
September 28一
I spent a few days with Lagos.
We opened up to each other,
and tried to be familiar with each other's worlds.
I feel like we have a great deal in common.
No hesitation. I've decided to go ahead and
confide in him about my dream.
I think I'm on the path to making my dream come true.
I'm so grateful to the friend from another  world
that gave me the courage.
We are united at the same world.
and when I'm done, I'll help him make his dream come true.
The dream of uniting all mankind.
I wonder why it is...
that your dad seems a lot closer to Lagos than I do.
Patema, you had this kind of face all along.
Same with you.
Eiji...
I won.
We must have seen the same thing, surely.
Same with Lagos,
and your dad.
That's why...
Patema...
It's so hot! I can't take this anymore.
My legs won't hold anymore.
It has to be here somewhere.
Not this one...
Found it! This is it.
My dad...
Labos...
let's tell everyone about them.
Sure.
You sure are looking at some bad things.
Good morning, sir.
The sinners are coming back from the sky?
I...
Certainly,
your hesitation at that time is the cause of all this.
So out of guilt,
you personally came here to monitor them?
From today onwards, resume searching underground.
We can't let them keep bothering us.

Like I said, stop that.
Like I said, stop that.
What is that?
What is that?
I think I see someone!
Hey...
I see them!
What the...
What are you all doing?
Stop this. Stop I say!
Hey!
It's the security officers!
Let's jump off, Eiji!
Aren't you scared?
If I'm with you, then I'm fine!
It's Eiji!
Don't hesitate this time.
Eiji!
Shoot him down.
What?!
All right!
At this rate we're home free.
Don't let them escape!
Hurry up!
Now that it's come to this,
let's step back and rethink for a while.
Where do you think they're going?
This is the perfect opportunity to find
those inverts!
Patema... May you rest in peace.
Patema!
The truth is... I lo-
Porta! Porta!
I'm home.
P-Pa...Patema!
Princess Patema!
Thank you Eiji, thank you!
Hey gramps, listen to this.
Lagos... Lagos, you see...
I see.
Gramps...
Is this...
There's a manual inside.
In there Lagos一
What are you doing?
Patema!
Gramps, Porta!
Patema!
If you fall down there...
At last... At last I find these inverts!
All of you...
What are you doing?
This is an order!
Capture all of the inverted!
Do you hear me?!
You bastard... Is this treason?
Take my hand. Here!
All traitors should just...
Porta!
Hey, over here.
Porta!
You filthy inverts.
Why? Why is it that you don't let go?
Why is it that towards these filthy sinners...
Stop!
Eiji!
Can you imagine,
the world Patema sees.
The inverted Patema is,
right now in an uncertain place,
scared,
and worried.
That's why I have no choice but to hold on!
I believe.
I understand now,
Patema.
Admirable courage.
Then I'll just take your left leg.
Then I'll take the right.
You won't be able to hold on forever.
If you want to be saved, come to me.
I won't let go.
Stop!
I...
Porta!
He fell! He really fell!
Eiji...
Bye...
Filthy sinners...
should be devoured by the sky!
W-what the hell is this?
What's happening?!
I wish you could have saved us a bit smarter, you know?
Patema...
Eiji... Eiji.
Eiji!
Thank goodness!
Where is this?
Look.
Once before a terrible accident occurred on this land.
Countless lives were taken into the sky.
Taken into the sky.
The few who survived
threw away living on the surface,
and hid under the ground.
The researchers survived and carried the sin of the accident.
Those who survived took up the task of guardians.
Huh? Does that mean...
The chief left his warning.
Patema!
Take... Take me with you too!
Okay.
Wait!
Clinging like that...
moreover it's Patema...
Eiji-kun. Let me read this for a bit.
My son.
Your dream may come true in the future.
