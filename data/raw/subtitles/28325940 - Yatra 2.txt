Greetings, kids. Greetings, sisters.
Greetings, all of you. Greetings.
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
Greetings, kids. Greetings, sisters.
Greetings, all of you. Greetings.
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
Every promise that we made in 2004,
Every commitment we made,
was fulfilled by our government
without any regrets.
Telugu Nadu Party, however!
Everything they said
and did was deceitful and full of lies.
Brother.
Go up and wave your hand to
the people like your father.
You can get people's attention.
No need, brother.
He's your father, isn't he?
He's my father at home. Once we come
out of the house, he's everyone's leader.
We should always be one step
behind the leader.
But never compare ourselves
to the leader.
Come on, brother.
You don't know politics.
Since we have elections now,
Chandra Babu is making false promises
of providing everything for free.
He doesn't even feed his mother
but wants to buy golden bangles
for his aunt.
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
Brother, your father is calling you.
Go.
My son Jagan Mohan Reddy
is very excited to develop this place.
He's competing as an MP for the
first time.
He'll be one among you
like a sibling,
watching over you all around.
Bless him.
Our party rules over 20 states, including
the capital.
You guys are the people of High Command
in the party.
How can a state's CM make you wait, sir?
He didn't care about the High Command
when he wasn't in power.
Do you think he'll bother now that he's
the CM for the second time?
He thinks he's the reason why our
party holds power in the capital.
It's not Indira's Congress anymore.
It's YSR's Congress.
Tell me, Arjun Sir.
Reddy Saab, the reason why
we're here is...
We have a list of candidates if you can
accommodate in your cabinet.
Ma'am says...
Let him in.
Arjun sir, it's a small emergency.
- Please, excuse me for five minutes.
- Sure, sure.
Welcome.
Please be seated.
Keep your head up high.
I'll be embarrassed if anyone bows
down to me, be it my enemy.
No matter how opposing I was against
your party,
do you know why you got the MLA seat
in your constituency?
It's because of the trust people
have in you.
Leaders like you should never bow
their heads down.
Tell me.
What happened?
As I was stopping them from
demolishing the poor's houses
and shops in our constituency
in the name of road widening,
the Collector issued an arrest warrant
against me, sir.
I acted upon my rage while talking about
the people's problems.
But it was not to insult the Collector, sir.
- Call the Collector.
- Okay, Sir.
- Who is this?
- MLA of the opposition party, sir.
What?
Good morning, Mr. Collector.
Good morning, Sir.
I heard you issued an arrest warrant for
an issue with the local MLA.
- Yes, sir.
- I just talked to the MLA.
He has explained the situation and
he is ready to apologise.
No, sir. He crossed the line.
We must not tolerate such
rogue activities, sir.
Mr. Collector, as the constituency's MLA
the Collector, you both are people's servants.
When your intentions are the same,
why do you want to arrest him?
No, sir. We've to take strict action
and send them a strong message, sir.
What do you want to do, Mr. Collector?
Our constitution didn't give us the authority
to transfer an MLA from their constituency.
Sorry, sir.
I'll take care.
Don't worry.
Sir, you helped me although
I am a member of the opposition party.
I'll always be grateful, sir.
Be it my adversary or an enemy,
I only wish for them to fall but
not for them to perish.
What's this, Anna?
We were here from 9:30 am,
though we were asked to come at 10:00.
It's 12:30 now.
Madam is still not here yet.
33 members of Parliament from our state won
and have come here,
but we're sitting here like a bunch of slaves.
What's the deal?
This is the Progress Party.
They teach you how to earn votes
as well as to be servile.
You'll learn it soon.
I'll talk to madam and let you know.
Yes, yes. I'll call you back later.
Sir wants to meet Madam, sir.
- Does he have an appointment?
- No, sir. It's urgent.
- Okay. You wait here. I'll come.
- Okay, Sir.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- What?
Mr. PM has come to meet you, ma'am.
You do know this is my coffee time.
I know, ma'am, but this is urgent.
Ask him to wait.
Okay, ma'am.
Greetings.
Greetings, madam.
This is Dr. Y. S. Rajashekar Reddy's son.
Madam, this is Suryanarayana Reddy
from Nellore.
Anna, please tell her the name
my father gave me.
Come.
- He's from Warangal.
- Excuse me, Madam.
- Yes.
- This is Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.
Member of Parliament from Kadapa.
- Namasthe, Madam.
- Madam,
- meet him also.
- Thank you, madam.
He's Vivek.
And he is...
Greetings.
Greetings.
- Hello, how are you?
- I'm fine, Sir.
Tell me your problems.
What problems could I possibly have?
You made sure I got my pension just because
you had a meal in my house.
What problems could I even have?
Then why did you come this far?
I came here all the way to see you and give
you some Colostrum milk.
Let them in.
Brother go this side
You're late for today's people's court, Anna.
Come back tomorrow.
Anna, we've coming from a long way.
We have to go back in the evening to catch
our bus after meeting Mr. CM.
It's highly impossible today, Anna.
There are a lot of people today.
YSR knows me pretty well, Anna.
He'd recognise me in the first glance.
In 2003, we clicked a picture together when he
was on his journey by foot. Here.
He takes photos with thousands of people.
How can he remember you?
- We came here from a long way, Anna.
For sure we have to meet CM. - Okay, go.
- We came here from a long way, Anna.
- Okay, go.
- Sir.
- Take them in.
How are you?
Sure. Sure.
YSR is collecting everyone's letters to him.
Sir, an emergency call.
It's urgent, sir.
Okay, Dear.
Anna.
look, YSR is taking leave.
Anna.
Anna.
Let them in.
Come.
- Hey, Sivappa. How are you?
- Anna.
What brings you here?
Anna, I have some work with you.
I'll take care of it.
Did you have your breakfast?
I'll have once my work is done, Anna.
Finish your breakfast first.
Anna, my villagers came along with me.
Is it? Let them come.
My child was born deaf, sir.
As a result, she is unable to talk.
The doctors said she could hear and talk
with the help of a machine.
Anna, It is not possible for us.
Please, do something and have them
fix the machine, sir.
We'll do it for sure.
Please take action immediately.
- Sir, if you don't mind, can I
give my suggestion? - Tell me.
Given our state budget, I don't think it's right
to spend four lakhs on a single person.
We can have many people treated with that money,
Sir.
What you just said is right.
I got it.
But tell the same in a way
she understands.
Greetings.
Greetings.
- Greetings, Sir. Vennela.
- Greetings.
Can you hear me, Dear?
Hey, if we gave these machines to every child in
this state, how much would it cost?
Around two or three hundred crores, Sir.
Regardless of the expense, let's make
it available to everyone.
Where do we get such a big amount of money, Sir?
What's with the money?
We can find some sources.
What sort of CM am I if I worry about
money for doing such good deeds?
- Prepare the GO.
- Okay, Sir.
Okay. I'll tell him.
Anna, all the preparations for tomorrow's
Chittoor Racchabanda are ready.
- Okay.
- Hey, Man.
The weather conditions are also not in our favour.
Is it necessary to go now?
People trusted me and made me CM
for the second time.
I don't have enough time.
Debt or help, I should
clear it in this life.
Did Jagan come back from Bangalore?
He came home late.
He's probably sleeping.
What is it, Jagan? Why are you not asleep yet?
No, Father. I'm not getting any sleep.
What's going on, Father?
You woke up from your sleep.
It's not even 4:00 am yet.
I've had enough sleep.
Do you have something to say to me,
Father?
You want something, Father?
Fetch me a glass of water.
It's too late now. Go and sleep, Jagan.
Okay, Father.
During the flight through the Nallamala forest,
the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister,
Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy's
helicopter vanished.
As 48 hours have passed and
his whereabouts are still unknown,
his family, party members and fans
are dazed.
Could YSR really be alive, like we are all hoping?
Did the helicopter safely land in Nallamala?
National Security is in search of YSR.
'Are you lost, Rajanna?'
'Did you disappear, Rajanna?'
'You're our deity
and the light to our darkness.'
'Did you leave us alone, Rajanna?'
'Are you really gone, Rajanna?'
'In that smoky forest, near
those unexpected currents.'
'Hey, birds, where is our
Rajanna?'
'Did you pass away while I waited for you
and scattered flowers along your path?'
'Your bright smile.'
'Your walking style.'
'Why did you leave us before attending
the Racchabanda?'
'What's going on, Father?
You woke up from your sleep so early.'
'I've had enough sleep.'
'You never went back on your words, Rajanna,
and never looked back.'
'Your unique personality.'
'You cannot be compared.'
'You will forever be remembered in
our hearts and homes, Rajanna.'
'We will remember you all the time.'
'You will be forever remembered.'
Even if we all are experiencing pain,
we cannot stop here, right?
We must move on.
We need a leader so that the discipline
of our party is not in jeopardy
in this current scenario.
People like me who couldn't even
become a Sarpanch
became MLAs and MPs and were
blessed with political lives by
the Great Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy.
If we must carry forward his ambitions,
our beloved Rajasekhar Reddy's son
Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy must be proposed as
the CM.
You're right, indeed.
It's not even been 9 months since
he became a member of Parliament.
If you make such a person the CM,
what would be the future of the senior leaders
like us who lived for the party?
Sir, people voted for us because of YSR.
Not because of you, me or our party.
If our political future must blossom,
we must make Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy
the CM.
People will vote for our party, at least
out of sympathy for YSR.
What's with these new practices?
Our party's decisions are made by
the High Command.
Then tell the High Command that
we support Jagan Mohan Reddy.
Did you get so far as to tell the High Command?
If you have the guts, sign a paper saying
you want Jagan Mohan Reddy as your CM.
I'll show it to Madam.
Sir, just look at people's sympathy and leaders'
rage. Let's sign even if we don't want to.
Otherwise, our political lives will be at stake.
Oh, wow! Look at that crowd, sir.
I've never seen so many people at
a politician's funeral, sir.
He lived like a king.
And became God after death.
Sir, people say YSR's son Jagan will
become the next CM.
150 MLAs signed a paper in his favour
and sent it to Delhi is the word outside, Sir.
I was glad that his Father died.
I didn't expect his son to show up.
He'll become the CM for sure based
on the sentiments outside.
If that happens, our party will incur a huge loss.
Jagan, not this car. Go and sit
in that car.
I will also travel with you
in this car, Father.
No, Jagan. Listen to me.
- You shouldn't come with me.
- Why, Father?
You wouldn't get it.
Go.
Come on, Jagan.
Let's take that car.
Father and I never travelled in
the same car together.
The one time I got to travel was
on his final journey.
I just hope he comes back alive
and asks me to get out.
He didn't say it, so I didn't get down.
- Sir. -Sir.
- Sir. -Sir.
Sir, you have the support of 150 MLAs.
Are you going to be the next CM?
Sir, do you think High Command would
accept it?
- Look, we have to win at least
20 seats this time. - No. No.
Have some tea, Mr. Madhu.
Sir, did you bring me to Delhi from Hyderabad
to offer me a cup of tea?
Besides, you made me carry the paper that
was signed by 150 members.
Mr. Madhu.
You showed me your politics in Andhra.
Now, let me show you my politics
in Delhi.
Sir, he has the support of 150 MLAs.
What can you do to him, Sir?
Okay. I'll look into it.
- Madam.
- Hmm?
There's some important news from
Andhra Pradesh.
Jagan Reddy has declared himself
as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.
He claims that he has the support of 150 MLAs.
I decide who will be the Chief Minister
of Andhra Pradesh.
Not MLAs. Not Jagan Reddy.
Tell Reddy to support the person I suggest.
Yes, Ma'am.
Arjun ji.
Yes.
Not only support him,
but also propose that person to be
the CM of Andhra Pradesh.
Hmm?
Yes, madam.
I propose the Hon'ble Mr. Roshaiah
as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
with my full consent.
What kind of democracy is this?
150 members chose one person
to be the CM.
How can the High Command choose
someone else to be the CM?
Why should we stop when we have
150 members on our side?
This is Progress Party.
Madam's words are powerful.
Let's go.
What a turn of events in
Andhra Pradesh politics.
Rejecting Jagan, who had the support
of 150 MLAs,
Just like we thought, Jagan didn't become the CM
(TV sounds fading)
Your love and affection
won't let our beloved Rajashekar Reddy
die.
Mr. Rajashekar Reddy will live in
everyone's smile.
I will also be a part of that smile.
I will become one with you.
For my father,
approximately 660 members
sacrificed their lives.
I will meet the family members of everyone
who lost their loved ones in the future.
I will consult them.
I want to request you all to remember that
I am with you guys.
'See, Father.'
'Are you seeing it, Father?'
'Am I the light for these people who
lost their shadows?'
'What's with
their Unconditional love?'
'When I couldn't find my way,
you wanted to follow me,
and started this movement.'
'What was that trust?'
'How can I
reach the shore?'
'How can I
take them to the shore?'
'If the head of your family dies,
you become an orphan, wouldn't you?'
'Without you, even all the villages became
orphans.'
'Without you...'
'this wouldn't have ever happened.'
'I must wipe the tears from their eyes
as your son.'
'So...'
'In order to help them,
I need your courage.'
What's wrong?
There's not a single soul I haven't
asked for help.
I've been to many hospitals.
I prayed to many Gods.
My daughter responds today if I call her.
She calls me mother now.
Your father is the reason for it.
What's wrong with keeping his photo
next to God's photos?
Brother.
You may not believe in God.
But YSR is real.
Hey, you know it was not our party's program,
right?
Why did you leave behind your party rules and
join the parade with him?
Sir, everyone, including our party cadres,
is supporting Jagan.
If I don't join him, I'll lose my prestige.
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to say that
to the High Command?
Good morning, Ma'am.
- Greetings, Madam.
- Madam, we have an issue with Andhra Pradesh.
Madam, since you didn't make Jagan
the CM,
he started doing group politics
in the name of a parade to console the public.
Arjun ji, no, no.
You're mistaken.
Ma'am, there are no politics
involved in this.
After hearing the news about his dad's
demise, many of them died out of shock.
This campaign is just to
console those families.
- Show it.
- Madam, take a look at this if you want.
He says there're no politics involved.
Then why are the local MLAs
taking part in this, madam?
He should've informed the High Command.
They didn't even ask for permission
from the state's PCC.
He just decided on his own
and started the Yathra.
- Ma'am...
- Tell him to stop the Yathra.
- Immediately.
- Okay, Madam.
- Greetings. - Greetings, sir.
- Come. Please sit. - Jagan Reddy.
I have something confidential to
discuss with you.
You please wait outside.
Brother.
Sir, you're my guest.
He's my man.
He will stay here.
Alright.
So, Jagan Reddy.
I have a message for you
from High Command.
Stop this Yathra immediately.
Sir, this is not a political Yathra.
- I'm doing this for my dad.
- Jagan Reddy.
Don't tell me stories.
I don't have time for this nonsense.
I'm going to Delhi tomorrow.
Let me know your answer
or decision by tomorrow.
Brother.
Why tomorrow?
I'll tell you now.
Hear me out.
There's no way I'm going to
stop the Odharpu Yathra.
I gave my word.
I give it a thought only
before giving my word.
What's there to think once done?
I must keep moving forward.
Just because he's the son of YSR
doesn't mean he can defy
High Command.
Progress Party can create another
hundred Leaders.
Tell him.
If he doesn't fall in line,
the consequences will be very harsh.
Sure, Ma'am. I'll convey it.
Thank you.
Jagan, the High Command will go to any
extent if you defy them.
Listen to me.
Stop this Odharpu Yathra.
Your dad's long gone. Don't invite
problems for yourself now, Jagan.
Do you want me to go back on my words,
fearing them, mother?
Oh, boy!
I'm not asking you to go back
on my word, Jagan.
I'm just asking you to be patient.
Brother is true, indeed, Jagan.
Your father served the party
for a long time.
Everyone has respect for him.
If you meet Madam once,
she might accept.
Greetings, Madam.
Madam, since I promised from my dad's grave,
I'm going on with this
Odharpu Yathra.
It's nowhere connected to politics.
Madam, many of them lost their lives in
depression after learning my husband died.
Isn't it our duty to console
those families?
What you said is right.
Do one thing.
Call everyone to our district party
headquarters
and do whatever you want there.
But.
You don't do the Yatra.
Madam, you consoled us at our home
when my father died.
We didn't come to you.
This is our culture, madam.
Please kindly understand.
I do not care.
If you want to do it,
do as I said.
Otherwise, stop it.
Please, madam.
He's depressed over his dad's death.
My husband worked for the well-being
of your party till his death, Madam.
Just give us permission for this.
My decision is final.
This is over.
You may leave now.
Madam.
Keep in mind.
God is the witness to this humiliation from you.
God is the witness for this day.
Mother, I'm done.
If you have something to say,
go ahead.
They warned me to stop this yatra or
face the consequences, Mother.
What do you want to do, Jagan?
Is there anything left to think about?
My father is known for keeping his word
and not stepping back.
Being his son, if I break the promise
then it won't make any sense even if
I succeed in the future.
'These people are showering so much love.'
'That's why I'll repay this debt in this life.'
'I will be the protector of every house.'
'I'll give it in writings that I'll
stay on my word.'
'Look at it, Father.'
Look at it, Father.
'Look at it, Father.'
'Look at it, Father.'
Look at it, Father.
'Look at it, Father.'
'Look at it, Father.'
'Look at it, Father.'
Pull over, brother.
What is it, brother?
What are you doing here so late at night?
Brother, I can't see.
Day or night makes no difference to me.
You can't see?
What are you doing here at this time, though?
Our beloved YSR's son is coming.
I'm waiting for him.
No, I mean, even if YSR's son comes
and stands in front of you,
you can't see him, can you?
Even if I'm unable to see him,
he can see me, right?
I'm here to let him know that he has
the support of people like me.
By the way, who are you, brother?
Your YSR's son, brother.
Brother, our YSR's son?
Brother, why are you here at this time?
I've been here since morning.
Brother, you're blind.
You struggle so much.
Why do you want to do politics?
I don't know if you consider politics or not.
But we need a leader.
You're YSR's son.
Please, be our leader.
Brother, did you hear me?
Brother, are you still here?
Brother.
Are you there?
Brother.
Brother, I heard it.
I'm here.
That's enough, brother.
30 years.
I traveled with your father
in politics.
You don't know about Delhi's
politics, Jagan.
If you go against to Progress party
or Madam,
they won't let you go at ease.
People will take revenge on you.
You will have to face difficulties.
Listen to me, Jagan.
Anna.
Buttermilk or coffee?
I'm leaving.
Anna.
You are my father's favourite.
You have traveled with him
in politics for 30 years.
If there is a situation to
leave the party
whose side will you choose?
Position is important in
politics, Jagan.
I don't have the energy to against
the party without authority.
Even you shouldn't do
such a mistake.
Excessive attachment to power
And fear of losing it
To me, this is all wrong.
I will never do such mistakes, Anna.
As someone more experienced and
older than you, let me say this.
Your one decision
can make you an unknown
figure in history.
Careful.
Anna.
I don't care if I am remembered
in history or not.
But if it does
The son who did not give up his
promise to his father
I want to be remembered
like that, Anna.
Jagan.
People there cheer you on when you
raise your hand and clap for you.
Do you think it's all for you?
No.
It's for the big hand that's
behind you.
Without the help of that hand
either you, me or your father
won't have any political right.
Keep that in mind.
If you don't have that hand
neither you nor your father
will be reborn in politics.
'Should I take a step
forward with others?'
Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.
- Greetings, sir.
'Should I be alone confused not
knowing what to do?'
'Can we struggle without any help?'
'Shall I forever remain an
unsolved question?'
'Should I take a step
forward with others?'
'Or should I be alone doing nothing?'
Let it be political war or
political revolution,
I'm accountable to only two people.
My father who gave birth to me
and a purpose.
And you guys, for believing in my father
and making him your leader for 30 years
and carrying him in your hearts.
After hearing news about my dad's demise,
I went about consoling and comforting
the families who lost their loved ones.
For that, they want me to ask for
High Command's permission.
They asked me to stop it when
I asked.
My father's known for never going back
on his words no matter what.
As that great YSR's son,
do you want me to go back on my words
and submit to Delhi authorities?
Or do you want me to turn my back
on them and fight?
Even if we lose everything,
we must never go back on our words,
brother.
Brother, the reason why Progress won
all these days is
not because of that High Command or this Party Symbol
We made it win for your father YSR.
Sir, the Progress' flag has been flying on
the top of my house for 30 years.
I'll bury it a hundred feet below the surface.
No one should be able to find it.
Hail JAGAN ...Hail JAGAN
Hail YSR... Hail YSR...
My mother and I are resigning from our
MP and MLA posts.
Hail Jagan!
Not just resigning,
but also cutting all ties
with the Progress party.
Apparently, my father won in Kadapa for 35 years
because of Progress' power.
A few Progress leaders
are saying so.
We'll know the truth about it after
the upcoming by-election.
Hail Jagan!
'Let's do this.
We have no fear.'
'Let's step forward and
show them our power.'
'We are the loudest voice.'
'Our silence is as loud as an explosion.'
'Oh... No matter who opposes us,
let's fight them.'
'Let's let them know we never
bow down to anyone.'
'Let's get into the battlefield.'
'Let's hoist our first flag of victory high.'
'No backing off.'
'We're the heirs of great leaders.'
'The prideful heirs of Seema.'
'It's the matter of our self-respect.'
'Your domination is crossing the limits.'
'We can tolerate it only to a certain extent.'
'We're done with your enslavement.
It's time for us to revolt.'
No matter how much we spend,
he must lose.
His defeat should trigger fear for
anyone who goes against the Progress party
in this entire country.
His political career should end
right in Pulivendula.
'Your rejection is inevitable.'
'This struggle is inevitable.'
'The people were feeling empty.'
'We were tested by fate.'
'We're not hesitant anymore,
we're determined.'
Sir, the survey reports are in favour
of Jagan.
What should we do now?
Ask our cadres to support Progress.
Sir.
For 30 years, we've been divided into
factions and fighting in terms of the party.
We lost our families and cadres
because of those fights.
How can we face them now, sir?
I didn't ask you to build relations.
I asked to do politics.
Theories and doctrines are useless
in modern politics.
We must make use of everything
that's possible.
An enemy of an enemy is a friend.
Our enmity aside.
We couldn't defeat his grandfather.
You couldn't go against his father.
We've got a chance now to defeat
Jagan Reddy.
Mr. Reddy.
You're the most affected one because
of him and his family.
It's a great chance to defeat them.
We need your help.
Where are you from?
Delhi.
In Delhi, your enemy's enemy may
become your friend.
But this is Kadapa.
If an outsider wages a war against
our enemy,
our enemy will become one
among us.
'Permissions and limits.'
'Doesn't matter.'
'No matter what, there's no stopping us.'
'There is no doubt.'
'Here's where our victory starts.'
'We're the heirs of great leaders,
prideful heirs from Seema.'
'Our self-respect is at stake.
Your domination is crossing the limits.'
'We can tolerate only up to a
certain extent.'
'We're done with your enslavement.
It's our time to fight back.'
'Your rejection is inevitable.'
'This struggle is inevitable.'
YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has created history by
winning the Kadapa By-Elections
with a majority of five lakhs and forty thousand,
to shock the ruling Progress party.
Even though our party supported
the Progress party,
how did Jagan win with such
a huge difference?
Activists don't know how to do
politics like political leaders, sir.
Hail Jagan.
How are you, brother?
We've won, brother.
Hail Jagan!
Get in, brother.
Hail Jagan.
With respect to my father,
by trusting me,
you, the people of Kadapa, have given
me this majority.
I'll always be grateful to you.
To defeat one person,
Progress, the ruling party and Telugu Nadu
party did their dirty politics.
But we, the common people gave
them an answer.
He says Jagan won because it was Kadapa.
He says my victory is sheer fluke.
Let me tell them one thing.
The change has started from Kadapa.
The first step starts from Pulivendula.
It's a 125-year-old party.
Power in central and state.
And with all that power,
money and resources,
we could not defeat Jagan Reddy.
If we can't defeat him,
Don't listen to anyone once we
go in.
- True. - We must stand by
our decision. and resign. - Yes.
Got it?
Sir, please wait.
Sir, please wait.
We need to meet Sir.
Hey, we're not here for the ticket.
We're here to resign from the party.
- Move it!
- Move.
Sir, we're here to resign from your party.
We've given our resignation letters as MLAs
to the Speaker long ago.
We're now cutting all ties with
the party.
Hey, do you guys have any sense?
You're leaving the party that has 125 years
of history just for a newly born party.
What kind of politicians are you?
Think about it again.
We don't have anything to think about, Sir.
We're here to end things here.
Hey!
- Party won't let you in once you
decided to leave. - See you, Sir.
There's no coming back.
I'll bring even more powerful leaders in your
constituency than you guys before you go out.
We've had enough of this.
Let's go.
What?
- Madam.
- Hmm.
18 MLAs of our party have resigned
because of Jagan Reddy.
We thought Jagan was impulsive.
But he's a mindful person.
How can you praise him, sir?
I'm not praising him.
He's breaking the Progress party into pieces
and building his own party.
If he was impulsive, he could've
made all 80 MLAs resign
and tear down the government.
Since he's a mindful person,
he only made 18 MLAs resign
and is making his party stronger for
the upcoming assembly elections.
There are high chances of winning in the
by-elections for Jagan's party for 18 seats,
as per the Surveys.
The results of these surveys make
Progress and the TNP worried.
Madam, we have bad news from
Andhra Pradesh.
We have no chance of winning a single seat
in those 18 seats of by-elections.
You're in charge of Andhra Pradesh.
Do you have an explanation?
Madam.
Threatening a person who has
nothing is easy.
It's easier to threaten someone
who has everything.
But waging a war against someone like
Jagan, who has everything and
is ready to lose all that he has,
is pointless, Madam.
He's like a suicide bomber.
He'll die and take us along with
him.
So, please, Madam.
Consider.
No, Madam.
If we bow down to leaders like Jagan in AP,
Other regional leaders will also
dictate us.
We're in touch with the opposition leader.
We have a plan in place.
We need your permission, madam.
Sir, I doubt if we could even
be considered as
a candidate looking at people's
sympathy for him.
All these days, we thought Progress
was our only opponent.
A third person has now come to ruin
our smooth political lives.
We must stop him at once, Sir.
His father's goodwill
or the sympathy he gets because of
his demise.
Those two are his strongest weapons, Sir.
We need a powerful weapon to face
him, Sir.
Use the weapon called Corruption.
Breaking news. The state's politics are
getting heated up day by day.
The ruling Progress party,
the opposition TNP party, has accused
Jagan of the YSRCP party of corruption
of one lakh crore using his father.
But, Jagan declared that these are just
allegations and later continued his campaigns.
As the investigation of Jagan's
embezzlement case progresses,
new angles of the conspiracy are revealed
In the 5 charge sheets provided by CBI in court.
One lakh crores.
We can't let someone who scammed one lakh
crores roam freely.
There's all evidence of Jagan's corruption
in court.
It's the biggest scam in the country.
For the first time in history,
the Court booked a Suomoto case on Jagan
and handed it over to CBI.
CBI filed 10 chargesheets against
Jagan Mohan Reddy.
Jagan's illegal assets case is taking new
twists and turns day by day.
Orders have been issued to Jagan by the CBI
to attend the enquiry.
Jagan stopped his campaigns and attended the
CBI enquiry in the Dilkusha Guest House.
We've just got a breaking news.
YSRCP's Jagan has been arrested and taken to
Chanchalguda jail, as per CBI's press note.
YCP Party cadres are mad that they have
unjustly arrested him in the name of enquiry.
- Thank you.
- Here.
Thank you, Sir.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Come on, guys.
- Congratulations on our success.
- Cheers. -Cheers. -Cheers.
Hello, Sir.
Tell me, Sir.
Just go and see what Jagan Reddy is doing.
Okay, Sir.
Tell me.
Sir, he's sleeping like a baby.
Keep an eye on him round the clock.
Show him our power if he goes against
any of our rules.
Okay, Sir.
I'll take care.
He's born with a golden spoon and
raised with all comforts.
How can he sleep in such a hot
atmosphere in jail?
Jagan Reddy is from Kadapa.
Kadapa people are used to heat and
problems.
They have a power to tolerate anything.
Without giving us a chance to
arrange for bail,
they're filing chargesheets once
every three months.
They're pressurizing the investors
of our businesses.
They'll seize our accounts soon.
They have the power, Jagan.
We can't keep up with them.
Whatever happened, had happened.
We don't know what else
we're going to lose.
You're the only man in this house, Jagan.
I'm worried about your safety.
We lost our father, who's the most
precious in the family.
What else do we have to lose, Mother?
This is not a good time to talk
about our pain and sorrows.
18 MLAs have resigned, believing in us.
It's our duty to make them win.
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Greetings to all.
They think that our party will be vanished
after putting Jagan behind the bars.
Because of your support, it's my responsibility
to lead this party.
Madam, they've arrested the man of
your house.
The women of your family never got
into politics or business.
Moreover, they are some cases on you.
Can you face all this?
It's true, brother.
The women of our family aren't taught
how to do politics or business.
At the same time, when we're in trouble, we are
taught how to deal with it and never back off.
Madam.
Madam.
- How is that even possible?
- Okay. Okay.
I'll have a word.
We need three votes to pass the
FDI bill.
Reddy ji.
Jagan Reddy has two votes.
Why are you not able to convince him?
I don't think he will support us, Sir.
Mr. Reddy, it's been eleven months
since he's behind bars, right?
He might have cooled down now.
He too needs us.
So, he will definitely support us.
I've been observing Jagan Reddy since
his childhood.
He's very stubborn.
I think you still didn't get to know the attitude
of Kapada people even after the by-elections.
They are too good. But again, they're
stubborn.
Once they plan to take revenge on
their enemy,
even though they knew that
they will be destroyed
they will never bow down to their
enemy.
Mr. Reddy.
No matter if he belongs to Kadapa
he's also a politician like us, right?
Throw an offer that we'll not put any
cases on him, also
he'll get bail if he supports this bill.
He will agree.
I'll try, Sir.
Jagan.
The Progress government needs you now.
Their necessity is a great opportunity
for you.
If you support an important bill to be
passed
I'll try to get a bail for you.
Listen to me.
Don't be a stubborn.
The consequences will be very harsh.
Brother, I'm not in a situation to
offer you coffee or buttermilk today.
You came while it's hot outside.
Drink some water and leave, Brother.
Listen to me, Jagan.
- Hello. - Did he agree to support?
- No, Sir.
Maybe your man from Kadapa didn't
back down yet.
A cat will be same as it was even
if you leave it in a forest.
If you put a tiger in a cage
it won't change, Sir.
Sir, ED has seized all your businesses
and properties.
You've lost all the cars and buildings.
Aren't you afraid of losing anything else?
Why should I be afraid, Brother?
Even if I lose everything, I have a house
that my father built in my village.
I don't have any issue with food as well.
Let them do whatever they want to.
I'll see.
Sir.
Progress is terrified of Jagan's
counterattack in Andhra Pradesh.
Though the TNP commissioned men and
women for 18 by-election seats,
the Progress failed to win
at least one seat and lost its deposits.
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
Hail Jagan... Hail Jagan...
After the division of the state, elections
started in the divided A.P.
The candidates of three major parties started
their campaigns in their constituencies.
Sir, we conducted an internal survey
in constituency.
We can't win more than 50 or 60 seats.
Should we once again appear in opposition, we're going to run out of business very soon.
We're going to win in 2014.
We're going to fix the government.
I got my political experience in my 40s.
How can you even think of losing to
a boy who didn't even reach his forties?
He thinks politics means going around
and consoling people in miseries.
I'll show him what true politics
is in the upcoming elections.
All the surveys are in our favour, Jagan.
We'll win for sure this time.
Sit, Brother.
Brother, we're up against Chandra Babu.
If we underestimate him,
it'll be our foolishness.
Sir. No matter what we do, Jagan's
got a lot of people's support.
We can't win if trust new people.
We must do something more to win.
If you make me win in this election
then I'll waive the farmers' loans.
No farmer will have to pay their loans.
I'll take the responsibility of clearing
all the loans.
Do you think people will believe that?
People live with hope.
They will surely vote for us.
Babu is offering to clear the farmer's loan, I will definitely vote for him then.
Don't trust his words so easily.
Let's say he does clear the loan. Then we would receive 1 Lakh for an acre.
Their hope is our weapon.
The YCP after winning all the by-elections
held in the state so far,
Entered the ring in the 2014 assembly
election and continued its momentum.
However, due to the farmer loan waiver
announced by Chandrababu yesterday,
the public's attention has slightly
shifted towards the TNP.
We can also announce the farmer loan
waiver scheme, Jagan.
Farmers' loan waiver is not that easy,
Brother.
You defeated Progress and came
this far, Jagan.
Our victory depends on your single
promise of a farmers' loan waiver scheme.
Don't take risk, Jagan.
Okay, Brother.
The government has not only increased the current
charges but also imposed taxes to harass us.
It's hard to run our power plant,
given the situation.
What should we do now?
According to the law, if we apply for IP
we don't have to pay the loan to the bank.
They gave us a loan not because of the
name of the company or the business.
They gave it because of my word.
It's not fair to get away with it
using loopholes.
Tell them we'll pay it back for sure.
Okay, Sir.
Jagan, It's a belief that I never
go back on my words.
Be it politics or business,
no matter what you do,
keep one thing in mind.
As my son, never go back on your words,
no matter what the situation is.
Brother, we can't go on with
a farmers' loan waiver scheme.
Then we can't win, Jagan.
Not only my father's politics,
I'm a heir to his values as well.
I don't mind if we lose the elections, brother.
But I don't want to make fake
promises like our opposition.
And betray the public after winning.
I don't want to lose my credibility.
The day we lose our credibility is when
my father and I will lose.
The farmer's loan is impossible to fulfill.
But by claiming that he will fulfill it, this big man is making empty promises.
Do not fall for such words.
In the first elections after the state bifurcation
the Telugu Nadu Party is in top place.
The counting is going on in many
places.
As per the updates till now
Telugu Nadu Party is leading the count
in some constituencies.
While YCP is backward in some
constituencies.
Breaking news, Telugu Nadu Party won
the 2014 elections.
YCP is defeated with just 1% vote share.
Hai ChandraBabu! Hail ChandraBabu!
Madam, our candidates didn't get
the deposits in all places.
We lost, Madam.
Why are you so happy?
True. But,
We lost. But, our partner won.
Jagan Reddy lost.
Can you face Chandra Babu
from the opposition?
Sir, you wanted to become the CM,
but failed. How do you feel about it?
What defeat, brother?
I could not become a CM
but, I won as an opposition party leader,
right?
We've become a strong opposition with
67 MLAs and 9 MPs in our first election.
He's happy that he won as
the opposition leader, right?
Let him come to the Assembly.
I'll show him what true politics is.
He should be terrified, and rethink his decision to enter politics.
Bharati, how long are you going to be sad?
The result will not change just
because you're sad, right?
You struggled 4 years, Jagan.
That misery will prolong at least
for 4 days, right?
You kept saying that I wasn't
home for 4 years, right?
I can spend more time with
you guys from tomorrow.
I can sleep for 2 more hours.
You said you could sleep for
an extra 2 hours.
Then why are you up two hours early?
A winner can sleep.
But the one who wants to win
must not sleep.
By the way, why did you get up?
To give you some tea.
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.
- Good Morning.
- You could've slept for another 2 hours since we won. - True, Sir.
If we sleep because we won,
the one who wants to defeat us will wake
up two hours early
and start figuring out ways to
defeat us.
Greetings to everyone in the house
and the Speaker.
In the elections that were held in
the state,
our party leaders won with a huge
majority.
We would like to convey our gratitude
to the people on behalf of the assembly.
Speaker!
Mr. Speaker!
Even after keeping an alliance with all
the parties in the state
and making unfulfilled promises
they won with a vote share of
one percent.
No matter how he won, but now that he has won,
let me congratulate the CM
wholeheartedly.
You'll always have the support of the opposition
party if you're fulfilling your promises.
Otherwise, we'll question the ruling
party without a doubt.
One national party to defeat one man.
We collaborated with an amateur party
and won with a vote difference of 1%.
Do you want me to celebrate
that kind of victory?
He said he won as the leader of
the opposition party, right?
His party MLAs should wear
our party scarf.
Attacks and arrests on activists and cadres
are an abuse of power.
Chandrababu's plotting attacks and arrests
on the activists on purpose,
allegedly says the opposition party's
leader, Jagan.
Being in the opposition party with
all these cases and debts on you,
how can you become a politician?
There's a golden offer for you.
If you change the party, there won't
be any cases against you.
Moreover, Mr. Babu will take care
of your loans. What do you say?
Will you file cases? Go ahead.
Arrest me if you want.
I won't surrender to your threats.
I won't change my party even if you
slit my throat.
What if I make you a Minister?
- Hey, sit down. - Brother, sit down.
- First, you, sit down. - Brother, sit down.
- Brother. - Sit down. - I'm telling you.
- Mr. Speaker!
Speaker, like buying sheep from the market
Chandrababu bought our MLAs with
his corruption money.
What kind of politics is this, Mr. Speaker?
- You are not eligible to talk about corruption.
- Sit down. - Sit down.
Speaker!
Hey, stop it.
Sit.
Sit.
'Sit.'
Sit down.
Me who lives like a fire
has to face situations where a moralless person
points his finger at me. It's so sad, Speaker.
Because of what you and your father did,
you're being called at CBI courts
and are facing jail time.
Are you talking about me, Jagan Mohan Reddy?
- Hey, what are you talking?
- Shame, shame. - Mr. Speaker.
Please, sit down.
Sit down.
Please, sit down, Brother.
If you have guts, the MLAs that you've
snatched from us, make them resign
and ask them to win based on
your party symbol.
You couldn't save your MLAs and now
you are talking about guts.
He can't run an opposition party.
He can't develop our regions.
That's why 23 MLAs moved to this
party from that party, Mr. Speaker.
He's always up to only one thing, Mr. Speaker.
"I'll become the CM.
I'll become the CM."
You can never become CM.
Please tell him to save me, Sir.
Suresh, I know.
You were the one who set Rajadhani on fire.
Just give a statement that Jagan
made you do it.
- Then take this fifteen lakh and leave.
- Sir.
I promise I never met Jagan Mohan Reddy
even once in my lifetime.
Politics is meant for the rich and well-off
people. Why us?
Who will take care of us if
something happens to you?
No politician will come for us
if we're in trouble.
YSR was also a politician.
Because of his Aarogyasri Scheme, my
father lived ten more years.
Dear.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Greetings.
Please come inside, brother.
I learned what happened to you.
Even if the police make false allegations
against you,
and torture you,
you stood by justice.
Sit.
Remember this, Suresh.
I'll make the ones who beat you,
salute you someday.
I'll see you.
- I'll leave.
- Okay, brother.
Can you give me a handshake, brother?
Why just a handshake, Suresh?
Come.
Hey, sit down.
Sit down.
Please wait.
When I'm speaking about the issues faced
by the farmers under this government rule
you're turning my mic off.
It makes me believe that you're on
Chandra Babu's side.
- What are you talking?
- How dare you call Mr. Babu with his name?
- Why are you talking about him? -Sit down.
- You cannot talk about him. -Silence.
This is not Lotus Pond or
Pulivendula.
And as the leader of this house,
I have every right.
Don't play silly games here.
I'll see your end.
- Hey, stop it.
- Stop.
- Sit down. -Stop it. -Sit down.
- Don't shout. -Sit down, first. -Wait, Brother.
You cannot run the opposition party.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What's the use of being in the assembly when we
cannot fight for people, Speaker?
We are going to boycott this place
and protest.
Let's go, Brother.
Come.
- Yes. Leave.
- Leave now.
- Go. - This is not a walkout.
You're running away.
Ruling party and opposition party
are two eyes of Democracy.
Being a leader of the opposition party, you're
scared and running away from the assembly.
You're not fit for politics.
You cannot fight for the people being
in the ruling party.
What will you do if you become CM?
Answer me before you leave.
Don't assume that we're running away from
the assembly because we're scared of you.
I don't know what fear is.
You may not understand me
or my politics now.
But keep one thing in mind.
I'm the son of YS Rajashekar Reddy.
(people hailing Jagan)
- (people hailing Jagan)
- Leave, Man. Leave right now.
What happened, Jagan?
Nothing, mother.
Every time I set a foot forward,
they pull me 10 steps behind.
I wish Father was still alive, Mom.
If he were around, I can face
any kind of problem.
He might not be here physically.
But he'll be with us, by our side, forever.
'Aren't you asleep yet, Jagan?'
No, father.
I'm unable to sleep.
Why did you wake up so soon, father?
It's not even 4:00 am yet.
I've had enough sleep.
Do you have something to say
to me, father?
Be it life or politics,
patience and endurance are very
important.
Even the strongest man cannot win over
a sea.
But, if one has trust in God and a never-give-up
kind of attitude
then that sea will also help you
find a way.
I'm telling you with my political
experience
Don't try to be a political leader
by believing in other politicians.
'Know the people well.'
'Trust only people.'
'Grow as a people's leader.'
'I still remember that day, Father.'
'When I asked you whether you
have something to say, '
'you didn't say this to me.'
Father.
Father.
Father.
I Heard... I Heard...
I'm coming for you.
All my steps are for you.
Journey.
This is a journey.
This is a journey of will.
I'll visit every house no matter
if it rains or a sunny day.
I'll listen to every heartbeat,
no matter if it costs my food or sleep.
This movement is necessary to eradicate
the sorrows from your scattered lives.
Journey.
This is a journey.
It's for the people.
Journey.
It's a journey.
This is a journey of will for
the sake of people.
Journey.
This is a journey.
This is a journey of will for
the sake of people.
I want to live with you all more and more.
I want to be one of you
more and more.
Journey.
It's a journey.
This is a journey of will for
the sake of people.
This is a movement to eradicate
the differences.
This is a great chance to know
myself better.
My every footstep is towards changing
the fates of people.
Journey.
It's a journey.
This is a journey of will for the
sake of people.
Journey.
It's a journey.
This is a journey of will for the
sake of people.
All these days he did Yathra
in Rayalaseema.
And people followed him.
Now he stepped into our Krishna district.
Let's see how much crowd will
follow him.
I'm seeing so much sadness
through my eye.
There will be many hidden behind
the curtains.
Who are you? What am I to you?
I started like a river to search
for an answer.
I'm carrying this question within me.
You're my everything. I'm seeing
it all in you.
I'm here to give you faith.
I promise to eradicate your sorrows
and stop your cries.
- Journey. It's a journey. - Sir, don't trust
them. The reality is different at ground level.
I've sung the song "We want you, Jagan,"
myself.
Please be alert, Sir.
Sir, Jagan gave a word regarding
the Navaratnaalu scheme.
Tell people that we'll give two times
the offer that of Jagan.
He promised to give a pension of rupees
three thousand to old people.
Just three thousand, right? tell them we will also provide it.
Give ten thousand rupees and come up with
financial schemes for women before elections.
We'll see who stops us from winning.
Journey.
It's a journey.
It's a journey of will for the
sake of people.
Journey.
It's a journey.
It's a journey of will for the
sake of people.
Kerala, Karnataka.
Greetings.
Maharashtra.
Madhu ji.
Where is Andhra Pradesh's candidate
list?
Sir, even though I am a state senior leader, I
don't know what's happening with me.
Then how can I get the candidate list,
Sir?
Forget Andhra Pradesh, Sir.
Sir, at least make me the MP of
Rajya Sabha.
Please.
2019, YSRCP Parliament Candidates:
Kadapa, YS Avinash Reddy
Rajampeta, P.V Mithun Reddy
Nellore, Adala Prabhakar Reddy
Bapatla,
Read it.
My name...
Read it, Suresh.
Bapatla,
Nandigam Suresh
2019 elections are going on
with a great enthusiasm.
A loud roars of fan.
Amazing victory for YCP.
The Telugu Nadu party and Progress
have fallen down.
YSRCP has won 151 seats out of 175 seats.
Majority seats. As we can see from
Rayalaseema to Coastal Andhra
the YSRCP registered its name in the
pages of victory.
Whatever the region or seat
YSRCP has bagged the victory.
The people of YSRCP are expressing their joy
as Jagan brought them a great victory.
I told you not to push him.
The party that has 125 years of history
is now defeated in the state.
40 years of political experience
has bowed down to one person's will.
Every battle in history
is either won through fear, or strength.
But for the first time
someone has won through perseverance.
Madam, who ruled the country and her Progress Party
Chandrababu, a political kingpin, with 40 years of experience,
have failed to get their sons into power, despite being with them.
But you, despite your absence,
have moulded him into a great leader.
Rajashekara,
you have won.
Indeed, you have only won.
YS
I, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy...
Greetings, kids. Greetings, sisters.
Greetings, all of you. Greetings.
