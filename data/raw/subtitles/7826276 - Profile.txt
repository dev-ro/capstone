We are an Islamic army and
a state that has been accepted
by a large number
of Muslims worldwide.
So, effectively, any aggression
towards the Islamic State
is an aggression towards Mus...
Lovely and spacious.
Uh, nice fresh white walls.
Lovely wooden floors.
Nice sturdy pillar
in the middle of the room.
And then we got
lovely huge windows
with a great view of London.
We've got, uh, the Gherkin...
and the Shard...
I-I don't know about
those windows, Matt.
- Why not?
- Oh, I don't know.
Just they'll feel like
we're in a fish tank.
- Everyone will look in at us.
- No...
There's, like,
a curtain railing.
We can put curtains up.
No problem at all.
But I think it's brilliant.
I think you'll love it.
Why do you like
this one so much?
I think it does the job.
It's exactly what we need.
It's-it's only... it's 1,312,
and the one you love,
the Richmond Road one,
is 1,912 a month, so that's...
a difference of 600 pounds.
Sparky, shut up! I can't hear!
Listen, the other one's
much nicer
because it has
the garden for Sparky.
- I prefer it.
- Um...
Well, listen.
- Babe.
- Mm-hmm?
I can go to the office
and look over the numbers
and see what I can do, okay?
- Matt, I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Okay.
Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!
We have brothers
from Bangladesh,
from Iraq, from Cambodia,
Australia, UK.
We... Nothing has gathered us
except to make Allah...
Yes.
Uh, um...
Allahu Akbar!
Amy.
- You got it?
- This is brilliant.
Yeah, brilliant. You know what?
I think the lawyers are gonna
say we're on shaky ground
if we interview him, but my gut
is you should go for it.
- Yeah, I think so.
- How'd you make contact?
I just, I just shared his video,
and he messaged me on Facebook.
If you're gonna
talk to him on Skype,
we're gonna need to record it.
Can we have a camera operator
in the room?
Mm, no, I don't think
that's gonna work.
Hang on a sec. Let me...
Okay. Right.
The I.T. guy says that he can
record your desktop remotely.
- All right.
- So any idea how you're gonna
play a young Muslim girl?
Is that my paper? Thank you.
I'll read up on it,
I guess, while I'm Botoxing.
Yeah.
Well, keep me posted, won't you?
Mm-hmm.
- Thanks, Vick.
- You know what?
I'm gonna have the I.T. guy
call you after lunch.
Can you make sure that Lou
calls Amy after lunch?
Great, Vick. Oh, hey, Vick?
Yeah, all right, babe.
Uh, do you think I could
get an advance on this one?
Uh, if I'm not mistaken,
you've already had an advance
on the Taylor story,
haven't you?
All right. Thank you, Vick.
I'm gonna show you how you can
look a couple years younger
with just a couple of products.
And place it right into
the inner corner of the eye...
Assalamu alaikum, everybody.
My name is Sarah.
So, I was raised Christian...
...former friends, um,
started to go to parties,
and they were drinking
on the weekends.
I remember asking my one friend,
and he responded,
"I can't text you right now.
I'm at mosque."
And I was like,
"What? You can't text there?
That is actually amazing."
Place the material
at the top of your head.
You may need to adjust it
a bit to get it in place.
So, with the eyeliner,
all you're gonna do is
put it on the edge and just f...
Oh, my God.
Hi, guys.
As you can see,
I'm not good at eyeliner.
It's so nice to meet you all.
I'm so thankful
for everyone that's watching.
I'd love you so much
if you subscribed.
The button is down below...
Less than four months ago,
Taylor was just a typical
London schoolgirl, studying,
struggling with loneliness,
arguing with her parents,
- trying hard to find some support online.
- Bye.
So, a lot of you
have been asking
how to get more followers
on Instagram.
This is Taylor now.
She's just one of
the 750 European women
that have abandoned their lives
to make a dangerous journey
to Syria,
where they are controlled
by jihadi groups.
Her new Arabic name
is Umm Saladine.
She created a new page
on Facebook
and posted the news
about her trip to Syria
and a photo showing that she
had married an ISIS fighter.
Made a huge mistake.
I'm going home tomorrow,
and I'll tell you everything
when I get to Turkey. Just...
You have to ask yourself
why these average
American or European teenagers
leave their lives behind
to join the ranks of ISIS.
It's because
they have that feeling
we all had as teenagers.
They feel like they don't
belong, they don't fit in.
- I don't fit.
- They feel like they need a-a purpose.
I don't fit.
I don't belong here.
I want to do something better
with my life.
Ahabak.
Ahabak...
Bilel.
The prime minister
says ISIS fighters are planning
to attack us here at home
in the United King...
And they're said
to be discussing plans
to send Islamic State militants
disguised as Syrian refugees
into Western Europe
to commit acts of terror.
They're said to be
planning on traveling
in groups of up to four people.
And...
Fuck.
Hey, Amy, it's Lou
from the I.T. department.
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
Uh, listen, uh, first thing
you got to do is
you got to create a separate
Skype account for Melody.
- Yeah, I've already done that.
- Okay, great.
So, um, go to your browser
and just open a window
and, uh, sign in on Skype.com
as the other girl.
Now, from here,
you're gonna call Bilel,
and I'm gonna stay
on the call in your Skype.
Can you make two calls at once?
- Yeah, yeah, of course you can.
- Okay.
And now share
your screen with me.
The special button,
it says "share screen."
And, Amy, um, you should find
a way to cover up that tattoo.
Um, what is that?
Is that a skull?
- Yeah.
- Tattoos are haram.
They're... it means
they're prohibited.
Are you Muslim, Lou?
Uh, my mother's Syrian.
Okay, do you mind if I just
call you back in a second?
Fine. No prob.
Why would she choose him
of all fucking people?
Yes.
Amy, his mother's lived
in England for 30 years.
- Oh, uh-huh.
- He was born here.
You know who else
was born here, Vick?
The terrorist
I'm about to speak to!
Do you understand
how racist and prejudiced
and politically incorrect
you sound right now?
Yeah, yeah. I do, I do, I do.
And I'm sorry.
- Um, I'm just under a lot of pressure.
- Amy...
Uh, the terrorist is
Facebooking me...
- Can you just calm down...
- ...and I'm supposed to speak
- to him in five minutes.
- ...and take a breath?
- I want to feel safe, and I don't.
- All right?
This is a terrible idea. I-I...
Uh-huh.
Oh, shit.
Look, will you help me
with a dress for tomorrow?
Okay. So, have a look
at this black dress.
- Okay.
- Old favorite.
Looks great, but I kind of
feel like a nun in it.
But what about the pink one?
Or... yeah.
I'll show you some sparkles.
Do you remember?
Can we talk about how big my
guitar is in comparison to me?
It's literally bigger than
my entire body.
What is going on?
♪ When you were here before ♪
♪ Couldn't look you in the eye ♪
♪ You're just like an angel ♪
♪ Your skin makes me... ♪
- Hi.
- Hey, Lou, sorry.
I just had to get some
foundation for the tattoo.
That's all right.
You know, if you just...
any point you think
you can't bear it anymore,
you can always finish the call.
No problem.
I suggest you just take a deep
breath and you just go for it.
Yeah. Much better.
Just... Yeah, that's it.
- I like it.
- Can you see the tattoo?
No, no. Good job with that.
- Yeah. Nice. Okay.
- Perfect.
- Ready to go.
- Mm.
Thank you, Lou.
Not a problem. I'll be here.
All right, deep breath.
Go for it.
I'll be here.
Salaam alaikum, my sister.
I'm sorry.
I've just started
to learn Arabic.
It's okay.
I'll teach you.
What's up?
It's crazy to be talking
to a mujahideen in Syria.
It's like you can get online
easier than I can in London.
Syria's amazing.
We have everything here,
Mashallah.
Wow.
We've liberated the city.
The citizens respect us.
You have to believe me,
it's paradise.
But every day,
people die in your paradise.
That's true.
And every day, I fight
to stop the killing.
Here the enemy is the devil;
you have no idea.
The enemy steals from
and kills poor Syrians.
And rapes women, too.
He's attacking us,
and we're defending peace.
Is the enemy
the president of Syria?
Tell me, what guided you
to Allah's path?
My dad left when I was little.
My mum died
a few years later, and...
everything just
started falling apart.
All my friends, their life
was, like, leading nowhere.
They started partying
and drinking, smoking weed,
taking selfies
and posting them on Facebook.
And I just thought...
"I don't fit in.
I don't belong here."
And then one day,
I texted one of my classmates,
- and he told...
- How old are you, Melody?
I'm almost 20.
Really? Can you come closer
to the camera?
I want to see you better.
You don't look 20 to me.
How old do you think I look?
19 and a half.
Can I ask you what your job is?
Killing people.
Killing people?
That's your job?
I mean, that's...
It's not a job, is it?
Of course it is.
I work hard here.
If I was in a Mexican cartel
whose members represented
each kill with a tattoo, I'd be
completely covered in ink.
Islam prohibits those,
as you know.
If your cause is so noble, why
do you do such terrible things?
Watch this.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Have you seen
what they're doing
with drones in Iraq?
70 air strikes since August 8.
Do you know
how many civilians they killed
while trying to reach us?
So, just as
their bombs and missiles
continue to strike our people,
our knife will continue
to strike the neck of theirs.
But enough of that.
Tell me about you.
What's the weather like
in London?
Mm...
It's cold.
It's, like, October here.
And where do you live?
What's that behind you?
What's that? I can't see.
Do you, do you like guns?
I'll give you plenty.
Starting with
this lovely Kalashnikov.
Kalash... Kalash...?
- "Kalash." "Kalash."
- "Kalash."
- "Ni."
- "Ni."
- "Kov."
- "Kov."
- Kalashnikov.
- Kalashnikov.
When are you gonna
come to al-Sham?
- Lou!
- Amy, Amy, I'm sorry.
I'm just...
I'm running out of disk space.
Just give me a minute.
Just hang on.
Quick.
Lou, h-how do I respond
to the Syria question?
Okay, look,
you can't travel alone
as a respectable woman,
so you should say that
you need to be accompanied by a man.
- Yeah, someone like your cousin.
- Amy,
- you're doing just great...
- Mm-hmm.
...but you need
to get to the topic
- and figure out how they recruit the girls.
- Okay.
We need to wrap up
this investigation
as soon as possible
for your own safety.
Yeah. Look, Amy,
you just got to be careful.
Look, the risk
to blow your cover is huge.
- They've got a giant I.T. department.
- Okay.
They've got some powerful
hackers all over the world.
- Okay, okay. So...
- These guys are no joke, okay?
Okay, he's calling.
Can you stay there?
- Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
- And the hijab, it's fine?
You look great. It's fine.
Just cover your ear a bit there.
That's fine.
Yeah, it looks good.
Sorry.
I got disconnected.
It happens.
So where were we?
You were showing me your guns.
I asked you when
you're gonna come to al-Sham.
I'm not sure
that I do want to go.
But if I do decide to, I want
to travel with my cousin.
If you want,
but I don't see why.
You don't need him.
Dozens of girls
make this trip every week.
You're not as brave
as I thought, Melody.
Do what you want,
but don't you have
any girlfriends
interested in hegira?
Mm...
My friend Kathy.
She's Muslim.
Maybe I could
invite her to come.
- She's only 15.
- Of course she can come.
Here, women are supposed to
get married when they're 14.
If Kathy comes,
I'll find her a good man,
someone to take
good care of her.
Ho!
Got a good feeling about you.
And I can't wait to help you
lead the life
that's awaiting you.
I'm gonna be here tomorrow
from 3:00 p.m., okay?
Okay.
- Goodbye, Melody.
- Goodbye.
Amy?
What a fucking asshole.
- Oh, my God.
- Can you believe this guy?
What a fucking little kid.
I've got twins, right?
13-year-olds.
Just trying to imagine
what that would be like.
I know, I know. I'm gutted.
Oh, shit.
Listen, I've got to go, Lou.
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m....
it's all right?
Yeah, yeah.
I want to help you with this,
- so, yeah, don't worry.
- Please do. Thank you.
Thank you, Vick.
Mm-hmm.
Well, that went better
than I thought it would,
but I'm not sure you told him
why you're not going.
Because I read in the
Al Qaeda recruitment tutorial
that in the beginning,
he will be testing the waters.
He's a hunter.
He wants to seduce me first.
I need to let him.
And only then, I suppose,
will he give me a
step-by-step guide into Raqqa.
Well, how long is this
love game gonna take, then?
I don't know.
It took Layla 26 days.
It says in the Al Qaeda
tutorial four to five months.
I can't do it, all right?
Jack wants a big splash every
day, and I need something to
- get people talking now and not in three months.
- No, but...
Get this file to me by the end
of October, maximum, all right?
Oh, Neil. God.
Not gonna happen.
"Kurds recapture Kobane hill."
I need a Reuters feed now!
Hey, baby, listen, I've
been going over the numbers,
and I finally found a way
to make the two-bedroom
on Richmond Road work.
All hail. Um...
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I did.
- I sent you a file.
- Oh, amazing.
Can you just have a look
at it quickly?
What? What file?
You got it?
- So, on the left...
- Wow, this is so detailed, Matt.
I know.
Top of the left column
is the rent for the two-bedroom.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
And so I basically split it
according to
our combined salaries.
I earn 70% of our combined
salary; you earn 30%.
So, I thought it's better
that I pay 70% of everything:
70% of the rent,
70% of the bills, the electric,
the water, you name it.
And, also, I calculated
that we're spending
710 pounds a month on food.
- So...
- Sorry, what?
- What?
- So...
- Do you want to pay 50%?
- No, I'm just...
Are you making notes
on how much we spend
- on food every week?
- Yeah.
And we are spending 410 pounds
a month on eating out.
- So, we're gonna have...
- Um, Matt, you know,
- I'm so bad with money. I...
- We're gonna have to start
cooking at home, baby.
We're gonna have to start
cooking at home.
Uh, we don't cook
at home, though.
I know, but we're gonna have to.
I'm gonna get my apron on.
Now...
- Mm?
- Babes, what's the problem?
No, it's fine.
Sorry, I'm just, um...
When does your lease end?
In five weeks.
No, I know, I know.
It's just there's a lot
on right now, and, um...
Babes, if you don't...
if-if you're not feeling
ready for it, if you're not,
we don't have to...
No, I am. No, no, no.
Let's-let's-let's do that.
You want to do it?
Let's get
the Richmond Road place.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I love you, baby.
I love you.
All right. Speak in a bit.
Amy.
- Lou.
- What time's the call?
Now. Can you not join?
No, I-I won't be able to see it,
but I can hear it, so...
He's ab... he's about
to call in two minutes.
You'll be fine.
I'll be on the line.
I've already sent you the link
to the recording program
in Skype.
- So just click it and download it.
- Fuck.
H-How exactly do I use
this program?
Just press record.
You've got it.
Lou, you told me that
you would be here to do this.
I don't know how to do
technical stuff.
I know. I'm sorry. I'm...
I can't move from here
right now.
I'm just waiting
for the tow truck.
Can't you go into a café
and just use the Wi-Fi?
No, I can't.
I've got to stay with the car.
- Just take the call.
- Fine, he's literally...
He's calling. He's calling.
- I know. Take it now. I'm tuning in.
- Can you listen?
- Put me on mute.
- Okay.
Amy, the music.
Music is haram.
Only nasheeds are
acceptable lyrics.
It was uploaded today
by our hired media center.
Share it. We need more views.
Wow.
I like it.
I shared it.
Yeah, I see. Good girl.
I was worried about you today.
I read about a really bloody
battle for the city of Kobane.
- You're worried about me, huh?
- How many people died?
We killed at least 20.
I'll show you.
Look, I got photos.
You know, their bodies
can rot in a mass grave.
That's more than they deserve.
You see?
Anyway, I'm not in charge
of logistics.
- Oh, no, no, let me see.
- Don't worry about it.
- Let me see. I didn't see it.
- Tell me about you.
Show me again.
I'll save the best
for when you get here.
No, I want to see it now.
Show me again.
You never told me if
you thought I was good-looking.
Mm?
Be honest.
I think you're hot. Yeah.
And you're brave.
Which I admire in a man.
Thank you.
What else?
- You got beautiful eyes.
- That's a girlie compliment.
- Come on.
- No.
I can tell you're
a serious man, Bilel.
I've been doing jihad
for a long time.
But we'll talk more about that
when you get here.
How long have you been in Syria?
One year.
Before that, I did other things.
What things did you do?
Who's calling you?
I'm sorry.
My sister was calling.
What things
were you doing in Syria?
I don't want to talk about it
over the Internet.
Why? You can talk to me.
There's spies, journalists,
everywhere.
I need to keep some things
for when you get here.
Journalists.
You know, they've got
no principles, no morals.
They're just...
they're vultures, you know?
Exactly.
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?
Really interesting, my baby.
Am I?
Is that a dog?
- Yeah.
- Your dog?
No, it's-it's my neighbor's dog.
That's good.
I hate dogs, man.
Dogs are haram.
They're dirty like pigs.
I love cats.
Yeah? Why cats?
They're clean, you know?
They're the only good listeners.
There's nobody
you can trust here.
They'd never tell
anybody anything.
Yeah. That's me and my cat Tibs.
Old-school photo.
These are nice pictures.
I really want a cat,
but my sister, she's allergic,
so we can't get one.
When you get here,
we'll get you a cat.
If you come to al-Sham,
you'll be really
well taken care of, baby.
You'll be important.
If you're going to marry me,
I'm gonna treat you
like a queen.
Oh, Bilel, I can't hear you.
Do you want to go
further with me?
Oh, fuck.
Sorry. I got disconnected.
Thought I scared you away.
Well...
it's a bit unexpected.
But what would you say?
I don't know.
I need some time
to think about it.
I want to get
to know you better.
First, you need to come.
You'll see.
We'll make a whole new life,
a very happy one for yourself.
I read this article about
girls that went out to Syria,
and they became sex slaves
for your fighters.
- Don't listen to what those idiots say.
- No, no, no.
- They're not here. I am.
- Read this.
What's this?
So?
There's a black sheep
in every flock. Okay?
But for sure, baby,
I'll keep you safe.
And when you're here,
during the day
while I'm out fighting,
you'll spend your mornings
perfecting your Arabic.
And in the afternoons,
you can do whatever you want.
Really?
I could hang out
with my girlfriends
even if there wasn't
a man to accompany us?
You can if you behave
appropriately.
Anyway, you European converts
are insane.
Oh, there's other British women
out there, are there?
There's tons.
Some Belgian and French women.
I swear they're worse than us.
These days, they're obsessed
with fucking explosive belts.
Wow.
Do you like them wearing them?
Yeah.
They'll blow themselves up
if need be, as well.
Wha... What's that, baby?
What are you looking at?
Nothing. I'm looking at you.
Show me your screen.
What?
There's a special bar in
the Skype, the screen share.
Just press the button.
Oh, it says
it's only in paid version.
I... I don't have
any money to pay.
Just, uh, use my card.
Here's the number.
You see it?
Bilel, I can hear
my sister at the door.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
Of course, baby.
Bye.
Lou? Hey. He's just asked
to see my desktop.
- What do I do?
- Why weren't you answering the call?
- Did you record it?
- Uh, yes.
- Just create a new user.
- Well, how do I do that?
Um, go to
your system preferences.
- User and groups?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Can you step over, sir?
- Just hang on.
Lou! Listen.
No, no, no, no, no. Lou, please.
- Please, he's gonna call in a second.
- I know, yeah.
Click the plus sign.
And enter a new name
for your new user.
Add a new password,
and then in the "verify" field,
type it in again.
- And click "create new user."
- Done.
Now, you need
to log in as a new user.
- Okay.
- Listen, Amy, I'm-I'm sorry.
- I've got to go.
- Oh, all right.
- Thanks, Lou.
- Okay.
Sorry.
My sister forgot her keys.
What's her name again?
Gemma.
That's pretty regular.
Why are you called Melody?
It's not your real name, is it?
No, it is.
My father, he was French.
And his last name was Nelson.
So when he heard that song
"Melody Nelson" by
Serge Gainsbourg, he thought,
"That's what I'm gonna call
my first daughter."
Abu Bilel is not
your real name, is it?
Yeah. It's my Arabic name.
Other one's dead.
You're gonna have
an Arabic name soon, too. Okay?
Show it to me.
What?
- Screen, baby.
- Ah.
Baby, why is it so clean?
Because my mother always said,
"The order on your table
is the order in your head."
Baby, I need to... I'll call you
the day after tomorrow.
- I need to go.
- All right.
Around 7:00 p.m.
If you don't like it hot,
don't put too much
chili powder, yeah?
You got to mix it hard.
- Harder, baby!
- I'm mixing.
Harder!
I don't want to do
the fighting and the cooking.
You won't have to.
I'll look after you.
I can't wait.
It's delicious. Mmm.
L'Aziza.
That means delicious.
- L'Aziza.
- Wow.
- L'Aziza?
- He's kind of hot.
- Do you think?
- Yeah.
The curry actually
tasted good, you know.
Hey, that thing
looks very... warm.
I mean, look at the way
you look at each other.
It's just not proper.
Did you really make Matt
eat that curry?
Oh, God, Kathy. Stop it.
It's all just part of
the recruitment process.
Stage two of Al Qaeda tutorial:
invite them
to have food with you,
as it breaks the barriers
between you.
Oh. Okay.
If you say so.
Oh.
That's a fighter's wife,
all right.
Oh, my God, I'm sharing my screen still.
- I'm hanging up.
- Good luck.

Melody.
I-I wanted to show you
something really horrible.
I'm sorry this is the only
place I could find for you.
This is where we're gonna be
swimming together.
Should I show you the rest of
the really small house
that I found?
I'll show you now.
This is, uh,
the first living room.
I apologize.
This is
where I'm gonna relax.
After fighting every day, and
then you give me foot massage.
I'll take you to, uh...
And then I'm just gonna
take you upstairs.
I'm sorry there's no lift.
I know marble's not good enough.
It should be gold.
I will find you gold, baby,
don't worry.
Bedroom number one
for baby number one.
Bedroom number two
for baby number two!
Now, this,
what I'm about to show you
is where the magic's
gonna happen.
This is a very special room.
This is the master bedroom.
And this...
is where we're gonna
lie together
and we're gonna sleep together.
And where you're gonna show me
your pretty lingerie, baby.
As I get older,
it seems my well-meaning aunts
always ask, "When are you
gonna have a baby?
You're not gonna be
young forever."
Well, Aunt Gale,
I might not be young forever,
but there is a way
I can keep my eggs young
for quite some time.
Hey. He's calling
in like ten or 15 minutes,
so I don't have long.
Okay, well, can you
tell me some more?
We've got these ten minutes.
Um...
Hey, that makes you look sexy.
- Does it?
- Yeah.
Does he really believe
that you're 20?
I don't know.
He never questions my age.
As long as I adore him,
I don't think he cares.
Really?
Yeah. He's a narcissistic
teenager, Kathy.
Hey, show me a video.
Absolutely not.
Come on.
Please, go on.
Fine. I'm gonna share my screen.
Melody, good morning, my baby.
Good morning, Bilel.
Are you working out?
Yeah...
Kathy, I'm hanging up.
Okay. Good luck.
Oh, sorry, my phone died.
What were you asking?
I just wanted to know
that if, uh...
if I did decide to come,
how would I get there?
- Would you meet me?
- Are you... are you ready to come?
What if I did come, and then...
I wanted to come back
for some reason?
That won't happen.
You'll love it here.
Yeah, but I-I heard about
those suicide bombers.
Their only reason that
they become suicide bombers
is because they want
to come back to Europe
and they know
there's no way out of Syria.
At least not without
going to prison.
That's bullshit.
Suicide bombers are
our strongest fighters.
We evaluate strength based on
two things: faith and courage.
Person brave enough
to blow themself up for Allah
will go to paradise with honors.
What's the training program
like for arriving girls?
Is it different
for converts like us?
We jihadists prefer converts.
Why is that?
Because you're more serious
about religion.
And at the same time,
more open about life.
Not like these Syrian women.
I grew up in Britain
and they grew up here;
the cultural gap's too wide.
They don't know how to make
a man happy, inshallah.
What do you mean that
we're more open? Hmm?
You know what I mean.
No.
I don't.
You're more affectionate,
if you know what I mean.
No, I still don't.
You're more imaginative
with your husband.
Isn't it haram to be more
imaginative in that domain?
You can do what you want
with your husband
when you're alone with him.
You owe him anything
and everything, but only him.
You have to fulfill
his every wish.
You can wear whatever you want
underneath your sartorial burka.
Garter belts...
fishnet stockings.
Anything you think
your husband might like.
Do you like
pretty lingerie, baby?
Well, I'll wear whatever
my husband pleases me to wear.
But since I'm not married,
I can't have
this conversation with a man.
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
I knew you were pure before I,
before I saw your face.
I knew you were beautiful.
But you told me that religion
isn't concerned with beauty.
That's true.
But you and I will have
extremely beautiful children.
Am I your type?
I don't really have a type.
But you said
you thought I was hot.
So, if you don't have a type,
allow me to ask you again
to be my wife.
I said I'm not ready, Bilel.
Can you stop pushing me?
What do you want as a dowry?
I don't have a right to a dowry.
It's the bride's father
which provides the dowry.
I don't have a father.
Here, it's the man who gives
his future wife a dowry
to show he'll take care of her
for the rest of his life.
So, what do you want?
A Kalashnikov.
Oh, that's what you want?
That's it? I'm proud of you.
Ba-Baby, you know, you can ask
for much more than that.
Yeah? Like what?
What could I ask for?
I don't know, a palace,
a castle, some pretty horses,
or the life of someone
who's offended you.
All I want is a Kalashnikov.
Why?
Well, 'cause with a Kalashnikov,
I can take
whatever I want, right?
Good girl, good girl.
I got one more question for you,
and it's really important.
- Ask me.
- I want you to promise me
that you'll give me
an honest answer
because we take this
kind of thing very seriously.
I promise. Ask me anything.
You a virgin?
Mm-hmm.
Really?
'Cause this information
will be included
in our marriage certificate,
and, you know, lying about it
is punishable by death.
And there'll be women
to check if you're pure
on our wedding night.
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?
No, I would never lie to you.
But you have before.
You're not who you say
you are, Melody.
Oh, I understand why.
I understand why.
You're not 20 years old,
are you?
It's okay.
You're ashamed to be this old
and still not married.
I understand.
So?
How old are you?
All right.
I'm 26.
- Can I ask you another question?
- No.
No more questions.
Then do you have long hair?
Yeah. Why do you ask?
Is it really long
or just mid-length?
'Cause most girls say they have
long hair, but they're lying.
Really, it's just mid-length.
Yeah, my hair touches
the middle of my back.
So, it's mid-length;
it's not long.
- So what?
- Nothing.
It's just...
I love long hair.
It's okay.
It can grow, innit?
It's not teeth.
Is it curly?
No, it's wavy.
Perfect.
I asked Allah to put
a converted blue-eyed brunette
on my path.
Bilel, my eyes are brown.
Really?
Huh.
I always wanted
blue eyes, actually.
When I was younger,
my mum used to always tell me
that I would have blue eyes
if I ate my carrots.
How many lies
we are told as kids.
Yeah, I know.
Believed her as well,
until I was like eight
and someone in school
told me it was bullshit.
She just wanted me
to eat my vegetables.
Anyway, here you are.
My Melody.
My future wife.
I haven't said yes yet.
Is that train tracks?
- Yeah.
- Where is... where is that?
Um, it's East London.
I fucking hate London.
Yeah.
It's expensive, innit?
And people ignore you
if you're in trouble.
It's true.
Last time I was searching
for a job in London, I failed.
I needed money.
When I applied, what do you
think they said to me?
"You're a Paki.
Go back to your country."
I showed them my passport and
said, "I'm born in Britain."
They said, "No,
but your country of origin.
You're a Paki."
And that's when
I got angry, you know.
If you live in a society
that don't respect you...
I found a way to channel
my energy, and when I got here,
believe me, the first thing
I did is I burned
that piece of toilet paper
I call a British passport.
Yeah. We're so prejudiced
here in Britain sometimes.
- I...
- I miss it sometimes.
Now, my mum,
she-she used to take me
to this sweet shop
at Edgware Road.
And the guy who owned the shop,
this proper saint guy, Nabil.
He'd always slip
a little chocolate bar
without my mum knowing anyway.
But you know what I used to do?
You know
the see-through plastic bags,
the ones that sweets come in?
- Hmm?
- I used to, um, fill it
with the sour,
fizzy, sugar powder.
So, most of the sweets,
I'd leave them
and just have the sugar, innit?
You know the little
beach-pail-looking things,
the...
I put as much sugar
as I could in a bag,
and my mum be like,
"You're crazy.
Your teeth are gonna melt."
My teeth ain't that bad,
are they? Look.
They're nice
and straight, innit?
- Yeah, good.
- And I'd walk out
looking like
a little tiny drug dealer.
Yeah, I miss those days.
And my mum.
But we got other things here.
The M&M's, Nutella, everything.
Didn't know
that your mother died.
I spent my childhood
in my neighbor's garden,
like, fixing old bikes,
you know, motorcycle engines.
I wanted to be
a mechanical engineer.
And when I was 16, I got
stabbed three times in a fight.
And my older brother Saeed,
he fought for me
and the police came.
And he got sentenced to 16 years
for killing the guy.
And I was like, "What happened?
Why's he spending years behind
bars because he defended me?"
And Saeed, he was like
the support system
in my family, like...
When my father walked out,
I went here,
the small one followed me.
And he got killed in Iraq.
And then my mum was sick
after that.
And I couldn't
say goodbye to her.
My phone wasn't working here.
Sorry, I d...
didn't know all that.
All alone in this world, innit?
Born alone and die alone.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sure.
What the fuck am I doing?
Sorry.
Didn't know all that.

The boys decided to play.
That's cool.
European team
against Eastern team.
That's how we play.

- Mm-hmm.
That's Jeff from West Yorkshire.
English boy.

He got shot in the leg.
He can't run no more,

Raffi from Tajikistan.
Wow, it's...
it's a real melting pot.
It's like a World Cup out there.
Melody, open your eyes.
Watch this. Yo!

- Go, lion!
You ready?

You see?
Yes, I saw.
That's how Bilel does.
Thank you.
You see that?
- I saw it.
- Left foot.
How are you, baby?
Yeah, I'm good.
Uh, lost my phone today, and...
now I've got to beg my sister
to buy me a new one,
and I hate to beg.
She worked so hard
after our mother died.
She's the only breadwinner,
you know?
That's why you should come here.
I'll give everything you need.
Life is beautiful
and it's cheap.
Yeah, it may be cheap,
but according to Sharia law,
I can't work.
It's different for you;
you're a woman
and my future wife, inshallah.
Organization gives all believers
a monthly salary of $50 to $250.
You'll have more money in Syria
than in Britain.
You'll be rich.
In Britain, you're fucked.
I'm telling you,
there's no future there.
Bilel, what if I do
decide to go?
How would I get there?
Shit.

I understand
everything now, Vick.
I understand exactly why
he does what he does.
You know, this-this process of
recruiting new devotees
over the Internet,
it's just a way for him
to combat his solitude.
His deepest desire
is vengeance, Vick.
He left Britain
when he lost hope.
He tried to get a job here;
they called him a Paki.
You know what?
This has gone far enough.
You've become
somebody else, right?
I want you to delete
those messages.
- No, no, I can't. Listen.
- Listen to me.
I've been playing this game,
seducing this motherfucker
- for too long...
- What's happened to you?
- What's happening?
- ...to not follow this through, Vick.
Please, you're not listening me.
You're not listening
to me, Vick.
Amy, what the hell
are you wearing?
You do know
how dangerous it is to be
walking around like that?
I'm in a sweet shop
that he told me about.
I've got the fucking sugar
in the bag.
It's exactly the story
he told me.
- I'm reeling him in to get everything.
- Listen.
You get me my story
if you want your paycheck
- at the end of the month.
- What are you talking about?
I haven't even got the process
of transportation.
- I haven't found the tariq.
- Tariq?
I don't give a fuck about tariq.
That's the most important
thing, Vick.
Amy, there isn't
any more time, all right?
You have lost it. Enough.
Oh, baby.
Uh, it's dangerous for me, baby.
They could try to locate,
so I need to go.
No, no, no, no. Look.
Where are you? What's that?
- Is that sugar?
- Mm-hmm.
- On your lips?
- Mm-hmm.
Where are you?
You don't know?
Why are you so happy?
- Look.
- Baby, I need to go.
No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.
Please don't go. Look.
- Do you know where we are?
- What's going on, Melody?
What's going on?
I don't know what you're doing.
I've got someone
that wants to speak to you.
Whoa.
Hey, man, Nabil.
Long-long time, no see.
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
How's Rashid?
Good. Good.
She's-she's good.
No, she is also catering,
catering, uh, business.
I-I don't understand.
I'm sorry, man.
Nabil, I need to go.
I need to go.
She send her best. Oh, oh...
- It's good to see you, my friend.
- Okay. Okay.
Melody, what are you
doing to me?
What are you doing to me?
Surprise me like that.
Baby, I need to go.
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
No. I'm ready for my hegira.
Did you hear me?
I'm ready to come to al-Sham.
Do you hear that sound?
That's my heart.
Boom-boom, boom-boom.
I need to know more.
If-if I, if I want
to come to Syria,
I-I need to know
how I get there.
- I can't believe I'm alive to hear these words.
- Baby...
You're making me
so happy right now.
Baby, tell me how to get there.
- How does it work?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You take a flight to Amsterdam,
and when you get there,
y-you're gonna
turn off your phone.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
Bilel, Bilel, Bilel,
come back to me.
Yeah, I got to clear
the area after the fire.
Baby, listen.
No, no, no, listen.
If I want to go,
how do I get there?
Baby...
Baby, can you hear me?
Oh, I thought
something happened to you.
Baby, please be careful.
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It happens.
I'm not scared of these
fucking kafirs, because of you.
Baby, can you talk to me?
Ma'am, can you turn this off?
- No, no, no, no!
- Wait! Wait!
Something's happening to him!
Bilel! Bilel, talk to me!
Pick up the phone!
No, something's happening
to him.
Bilel, please pick up the phone!
No! He's not there.
Something happened.
Vick.
Vick.
Amy?
What's going on?
He's dead.
- No.
- He's dead.
- No, no, no. He's here.
- Shut up!
- Re-Return it. He's not.
- He's dead!
- It's the connection.
- Shush, please, please!
Vick, I killed him.
You told me to contact him,
and I-I made him call me,
and-and the drones,
- they, they, they...
- What's going on?
How did he have
your phone number, Amy?
I just watched him die
on my screen, Vick!
He just exploded
in front of me!
Did you record the video?
Listen to yourself.
I just fucking
killed someone, Vick!
I just watched him
blow up on my screen!
He's a fucking terrorist,
Amy, all right?
You did the world a favor.
You're a fucking hero.
Just listen to me. Listen.
Did you record video?
Did you?
Yes, Vick,
but I don't want to use it.
- Listen, Amy.
- I don't want to use it.
The story's over, all right?
Send me the video right now.
I'm gonna call Jack.
No, no, no.
Vick, Vick, Vick,
I don't want to...
Hey, baby.
I-I sent you the prices
for the movers.
Can you just stop
calling me "baby..."
- Did you check it?
- ...please?
Okay. All right.
Um, did you get the invitation
for Alex's dinner?
- No, no.
- What...
I'm not really
in the mood, Matt.
Uh, fancy the cinema?
There's this new film,
uh, Pride,
with, uh, Im-Imelda Staunton
and Bill Nighy.
It's about the mining strikes
and l-lesbian and gay
activities around it.
Sounds exciting.
But I've got
a lot of work to do, babe.
Okay, baby...
Sorry, I mean Amy.
This is like
the third time this week
you've been working late.
And it doesn't look like
you're working.
It looks like
you're drinking, babe.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just been a tough
couple of days, all right?
Is it connected
with, um, Bilel?
What?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
Your Facebook post.
Oy.
Sparky misses you.
So do I.
I miss you, too.
I'm s...
All right, let-let's,
let's-let's go to the movies.
Yeah?
Does it look funny?
The trailer looks
quite promising, yeah.
All right. Can you, um...
can you come pick me up?
I'll be ready
in like 15 minutes.
Yeah, okay.
...because of you.
Fuck you!
- Babe, baby, it's a joke. It's a joke.
- Fuck you!
Baby, baby, baby. I'm so sorry.
No, that is not okay, Bilel!
- Listen to me.
- I-I watched you die
- three days ago.
- Baby, understand, I can't...
S-Saw a fucking explosion.
I can't live another day
without you.
I can't stand to think of you
in that corrupt country.
I love you
for the sake of Allah.
I love you more than
I loved anyone.
You should be here with me.
So we're gonna get married now.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean married?
We're gonna do it over Skype.
What?
Baby, all you have to do
is pronounce, "Qabilt."
It means "I accept."
It's not legal, is it?
Melody.
Do you love me?
- I can't do this.
- Baby...
I thought
you died a few days ago.
There was...
there was no connection.
I couldn't call you.
I'm here now.
Say one word and we'll be
together forever, please, baby.
Do you love me?
"Qabilt."
Stop it.
Just, just...
Qabilt.
Now we're... baby, we need
two witnesses to do this.
I've got two of my friends here,
but I don't want them
to see your beauty,
so just cover your face
and leave your eyes, okay?
Qabilt.
As long as I'm alive, inshallah.
You're really mine now.
You're really my wife now.
What? No, no, no, no, no.
N... No, it's not serious.
It's not real.
It's just a joke, isn't it?
No joke.
As soon as you come to Syria,
our marriage will be validated.
What? I mean, I just have to...
to set foot into Syria, and
then I'll be Mrs. Al-Britani?
No, no, no. She's only mine.
I told you, she...
Only mine.
Melody.
Ah, okay, okay.
Melody, I got
a wedding present for you.
Eh?
I love you!
I'm ready to go.
Tell me what to do.
Okay. The day you depart,
you tell your sister you're
staying at your friend's house.
You leave early in the morning,
and you go to the airport.
You take a bag
the same size as normal.
And don't get caught, baby.
There's police everywhere.
What if someone asks me
questions at the airport?
- What do I say?
- You tell them you're with
Doctors Without Borders.
Now, I'll tell you more
over a secure line
once you complete
the first leg of your trip.
In Amsterdam,
you stay in the Hotel Birdcage.
Why can't I fly
directly to Istanbul?
Direct way
isn't always the closest.
I'll meet you in Turkey,
then take you across the border.
Just want to tell you
one more time that I love you.
You're my jewel, and don't
forget you're mine forever.
Get out! Get out! Out!
- Melody?
- Get out!
Get out of here!
- Get out!
- Melody?
Hey, I'm sorry. I-I don't know
how he just got in here.
He just fucking got
in the door. I'm sorry.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
it's fine.
- I love you.
- I'm sorry.
I have to go wash
my hands and face. I'm...
Don't worry.
- Babe, hi.
- So now you're his jewel?
No, no, listen. Listen to me.
- Listen.
- No, no, no, listen.
It was this thing
that I was doing for Vick.
- All right?
- I can't... I'm not doing this anymore.
- Please just listen to me.
- This is fucking ridiculous.
- It was this undercover thing I was doing.
- No!
I got so much
good information from him.
No, I can't!
You're fucking with my head!
And I just had to lie with...
and I just had to lie.
- I didn't lie to you about it.
- No, I-I'm done. I'm done.
- No, no, no. Please don't...
- I'm done.
No, no, no!
Salaam alaikum.
My beautiful baby.
Are you really in Amsterdam?
I'm-I'm here. I'm really here.
Flight to Istanbul tomorrow.
Can you tell me what to do?
How did you pay
for your tickets?
Stole my sister's card
and bought them online.
So strong, my wife.
I'm proud of you.
If you still have
the credit card,
feel free to buy me some stuff.
What do you want?
- You know.
- No, I don't.
Well, cologne.
Well, a good brand.
Like, a good brand, a good kind.
What brands do you like?
I love Egoiste by Chanel.
Something nice from Dior.
I trust you.
Okay. Anything else?
Maybe surprise me.
Okay, baby.
Can we talk about tomorrow
and how I get there?
Where will you be waiting?
Actually, I'll not be able
to meet you.
But you need to buy a ticket
for a flight
across the country, 'cause
driving will take too long.
What do you mean that you won't
be there waiting for me?
You promised.
I know. You'll be okay.
You're a big girl,
aren't you, my wife?
Dozens of Europeans
make this trip every week.
You can do this, my lioness.
That wasn't the plan, was it?
We went over this
many times, Bilel,
and you told me that
you'd be there waiting for me.
You said that you would
be there waiting for me.
You promised.
You said that I'd be safe.
You said that nothing was
more important than my safety,
- didn't you?
- Listen to me.
- Are you lying to me?
- You gonna shut up for a minute
and let me speak.
- Shut up!
- It'll be a piece of cake.
When you arrive
at the airport in Istanbul,
you buy a one-way ticket
for Urfa.
- It doesn't cost anything.
- What?
Like 50 euros. You pay in cash.
- Otherwise, I'll pay for it.
- No, no, no, I-I can't.
- I can't do this, Bilel.
- Before you leave Amsterdam,
- you withdraw your money...
- I need you to be... I need...
Listen to me.
- Can you shut up with your crap for a second?
- Bilel, please.
- Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
- I need to...
Meet me where you said
you would meet me.
You promised that
you would meet me there.
Just stop shouting at me
like that, okay?
No, no, but I can't,
I can't do this by myself.
I'm the one who gives
the orders around here,
not you, do you understand?
- No, no, listen to me.
- Who is there with you?
- Who is at the door?
- I don't know.
- Someone knocked at the door.
- Show me your room.
Show me your room.
- What?
- Where are you exactly?
I'm in Amsterdam
at the Birdcage,
exactly where you told me to be.
Look at my room. Look.
Do you want to see
outside the room?
Do you want to see
my plane ticket?
Look. Look.
You're gonna shut your mouth.
You don't speak to me like that.
Do you know who I am?
I command a hundred soldiers
every day!
I haven't even told you
a quarter of the truth!
- No, no. Please.
- I'm wanted internationally.
- That's why I can't even go...
- Please don't be disappointed.
I can't do this by myself. Please, please...
- Who's in the room with you?!
- Just calm down. Calm down.
Just tell me what to do
and I will do it.
Fucking disappointed in you,
baby, okay?
I thought you were
a strong woman.
I am.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm, uh...
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I'll call you back
- in ten minutes with the instructions, okay?
- No, no.
- Buy your ticket to Urfa now.
- Listen, listen, I-I'll...
Matt, somebody's calling you.
Uh, who is it?
Uh, it's Amy.
Matt!
Hi.
You've reached Vick Gillespie.
Um...
Fuck you.
♪ Oh, nothing's gonna change
my love for you ♪
♪ I wanna spend... ♪
I'm so sorry, baby.
I-I bought the-the tickets.
I found... I'm coming. I-I...
I wouldn't...
I-I'm not trying to trick you.
You take off your veil.
Yeah, sorry. Fuck.
For a second. Um, um...
Just went downstairs
to get a drink.
I didn't want
to draw attention to myself.
I'm putting it back on.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Mashallah.
Our children are gonna be
really good-looking
with parents like us.
We should talk about
our wedding night.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Okay.
Anyway, we'll be together
tomorrow night.
- There's another problem in the phone networks...
- Mm-hmm.
...where I'm located about,
so you're gonna have to use
your new phone to call a number
I'm about to give you.
This is the guy in charge
of border safety, okay?
You can tell him you're my wife,
and you'll be treated
like a queen.
Write this number down.
Triple two,
eight, six,
triple four,
two, two, one,
six, seven.
Hello?
I-I-don't speak Arabic.
Can you speak English, please?
I don't speak...
I don't speak Arabic.
Babe, no, baby, don't hang up.
Put him on speakerphone.
Call him back.
Put him on speakerphone.
What's happened? What?
My-my phone died.
- Baby...
- I-I have another one.
- I have another one.
- Good.
Yeah.
Okay. Permission's set.
You're gonna call me
from Istanbul tomorrow.
I can't wait for you to be here.
I'm just scared.
Just hurry up and get
everything sorted, okay?
Be discreet.
Yeah.
Are you happy?
Yeah.
Are you scared?
You tell me not to be,
so I'm not.
See you tomorrow.
I'm the happiest man on Earth.
- I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.
- I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.
- Amy.
- Hey. Hi.
Hey, how you doing?
- Long time, no see.
- Could you, um,
translate something
for me, please?
Uh, I'm ju... if it's urgent.
- I'll play you the recording.
- Yeah. Sure, y...
Uh, "I'm sending you
another girl tomorrow."
"This is the third girl
this month.
You're good."
Uh, "She's rotten meat.
Only pay 2,000."
"If she's got green eyes,
they'll pay 200 extra."
"No, she's got brown eyes."
Amy, what's this about?
Amy, what... Are you there?
Hello? You there?
I love you, too, baby.
These were the last words
that Bilel spoke to me.
At first, police weren't able
to identify him.
And then I mentioned
his brother in prison,
and it transpired
they knew exactly who he was.
His real name is
Abdul-Hamid Nazari.
He has three wives,
age 20, 28 and 31.
Two are converts like Melody.
They all live with him in Syria.
He is the father
of at least three boys
under the age of five.
Who is there with you?
Who is at the door?
- Vick.
- Oh, that camera's too late.
Yes, Amy.
I'm excited about the preview,
but I'm gonna need
the rough cut to...
No, no, it's not
gonna happen, Vick.
You need to look at the
screenshot I've just sent you.
He's, um... he's threatened me.
I don't think
we should run the piece.
Nick, can you get out, please?
I'm sorry, mate.
Amy, why haven't you
deleted your account?
Because I couldn't. Uh...
If I delete them, there's
gonna be doubt and uncertainty.
I need to... I need to make sure
there's a connection, you know?
So I know where he is,
if he's behind my door
or far away.
Yeah, don't come in here
right now, please.
- Hello?
- Yes, I'm-I'm here...
- Melody...
- Bilel, please, please.
Calm down.
I-I needed to return to London.
My-my sister, she found out
I was in Amsterdam,
and she called the police.
Bilel, listen,
she showed the cops the...
all the messages,
so I-I don't think
that you should call
this number again, okay?
- I'm gonna disconnect it.
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, no, no, I'm trying to protect you.
- That's too much.
I'm trying to protect you, babe.
We can find you
in a matter of minutes.
No, no, please, please,
please, Bilel.
Please listen to me.
I'm trying to protect you.
You're like
the rest of them, okay?
You're gonna pay
for what you did.
Amy... how did he get
your British number?
I-I think, um...
I think I might have called him
from my... from my
British number for a second.
Christ, look, just send me the
number that he called you from,
and I'll try and trace it, okay?
Right.
Yeah.
That's a British number.
It belongs to someone
called Hamza.
- He lives in Manchester.
- No.
Could he have
come back to the UK
- within the last 48 hours?
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I'm gonna have to refer it to Jack.
- Fuck!
Jesus Christ, Vick.
Let me just try
and call the number.
Is this Hamza?
Your son has been
calling my daughter,
and I don't think
it's appropriate.
She's 20 years old.
Is he in Syria?
Hello?
Vick?
Can you see?
I'm calling police, Amy.
Look, you need to change
your phone number
and your address, all right?
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
Fuck!
Sparky!
♪ But I'm a creep ♪
♪ I'm a weirdo ♪
♪ What the hell am I
doing here? ♪
♪ I don't belong here. ♪
I'm afraid.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
You're not who
you say you are, Melody.
Please, please, please...
I love you, baby.
Baby, baby, baby.
Can you just stop?
I love you, baby.
Please, baby.
I love you!
Can you just... stop it!
Can I just stop it?
Just stop.
