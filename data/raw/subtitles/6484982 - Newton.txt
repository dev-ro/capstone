Long Live Mangal Netam!
I am not here to seek votes.
Don't vote for me.
I want development for you all.
My dream is to see every child
with a laptop in their right hand.
And a cell-phone in their left.
But they stand like thorns
in my path
I won't allow it as long as I live.
The Commies quote parables,
and I perform miracles.
If they shoot arrows,
I fire cannons.
Long Live Mangal Netam!
We'll have dinner together.
Don't worry. We're nearly there.
Sir!
Turn the car around!
Get down!
The third incident in two weeks.
The Maoists have struck again.
The government has promised
stern action.
Additional reinforcements
will be deployed.
Oh no!
The power has gone again.
Nutan
- I'm checking.
- Son, go and see.
The others have power.
- I'll check the fuse.
- Is it just us?
Must have tripped
Chanchal has left. His workshop
is so successful.
He has opened a showroom too.
His wife works with him.
- The fuse gone again?
- Yes.
Everyone is getting married
but our son.
You seem to know everything.
I worry about my son.
- Is the power back?
- Yes, son.
- Attending tomorrow's workshop?
- Yes.
The Indian election...
The elections will cost
five billion dollars
814 million voters
9 million polling booths.
We break our own records
with every new election.
We've proved it.
Although some rogues get elected
to parliament...
...we will not allow gangster tactics
in the elections.
How?
Because we, the election volunteers,
will not let it happen.
Very well.
That's if we aren't bumped off.
Who said that?
Stand up! You won't be punished.
It's natural to be afraid after
what happened yesterday.
Only human nature.
The Maoists have made it clear
they'll boycott the elections.
There is only one weapon
to stop them and that is...
...our voting machine.
Remember we have only
one aim...
...to hold free and fair elections.
What if the Maoists attack our
polling booth? What do we do?
Don't play the hero.
Do as they ask.
They want the voting machine,
hand it over.
We'll cancel the votes and
re-election will be organized.
Anyone else?
And if they attack on re-election
day?
Then we'll have another
re-election.
What if they attack on the
"re-re" election day?
What's your name?
Newton
Newton?
"Apple" Newton?
Newton, what comes after two?
- Three.
- After three?
- Four.
- After four?
Good boy, sit down.
You explained things so well, sir.
My respects to you, sir.
Never mind.
Sir, you made light of
my simple doubt.
My answer only matched
your question.
- Sir, I genuinely wanted...
- Of course, sit down
Newton.
Tell me who named you?
Was your father a physics teacher?
Your mother's whim?
- Who named you?
- I named myself.
Meaning?
But why?
My parents named me Nutan (new)
Kumar. Made the school kids laugh.
Just like you.
Nutan Kumar!
So what did you do?
On the class 10 form, I changed "Nu"
to "New," and "tan" to "ton".
Changed "Nu" to "New" and "tan"
to "ton".
You gave yourself a big name
to live up to.
Like you're blowing your
own trumpet.
- Testing me again?
- Who am I to test anyone?
Tell me.
Do you know how Newton
changed the world?
Gravity. Optics.
For years you've lived as Newton...
...but forgotten the essential.
He leveled all differences.
Ask me how.
How?
Before Newton, people thought
there were different laws...
...for heaven and earth.
For church and temple.
Different laws for kings
and commoners like us.
But at a single stroke,
Newton proved us wrong.
Nature treats everyone equally.
Tycoon Ambani and a tea-seller
jump off a cliff simultaneously.
They'll land together
at the same time
Newton proved - for Nature
we're all the same.
King or beggar.
- Which department are you in?
- Not assigned yet. Still on probation.
Why are you on election duty?
I'm a Reserve.
Good. Reserves are useful.
There's always a 12th player
in cricket and football too.
This place must seem a small town
next to Bhopal.
Wherever our son is happy
is fine by us.
You're so right.
Retirement is better spent with
one's children.
You don't look over 60
60? I'm just 57.
My son forced me to take early
retirement when he got a job.
If only all sons were like Nutan.
It's Newton.
Our daughter Ankita made this.
She has always loved to embroider.
You won't lose your handkerchiefs
again.
Our daughter will embroider
your initials on them.
He keeps losing them.
Here she is.
How are you?
We're fine. I hope you're well too.
Eat something with the chai.
- Did Ankita cook them?
- Yes.
Please sit.
Nutan, have a pakora
Newton.
My English is very poor.
Drink up before a fly falls into it.
If you want to ask her something,
go ahead.
Saving it for after the wedding?
Seen her embroidery,
had pakoras and tea.
Nothing left to ask.
Let him ask. He has a Masters
in physics.
Ask her something, son.
- Have you any hobbies?
- I love watching movies.
- What's your favorite movie?
- "Sweety goes to her in-laws".
Which college did you attend?
I didn't go to college
I'd never send her to
that den of rascals.
Studying is a ruse for wasting time.
And after high school?
I left in Class 9.
- When was that?
- Three years ago.
How old are you?
Sixteen and a half.
She's a minor.
Nutan, better that she grows up
at her in-laws.
- Sit down.
- She's underage.
Please sit.
She's underage.
Not for long. Marry her later.
Her father is a contractor.
You're a government officer.
A life of ease.
- Sorry, not interested.
- Son, don't say no.
The dowry is 1 million rupees
cash and a motorcycle.
Don't want any of it.
Who's giving it to you? I'll take it.
Talking back to your father.
Calm down
I will marry a graduate.
Chewing your own degree isn't enough?
Must she have one too?
What's wrong with a college graduate?
Will she massage your
mother's feet?
The job has made you deluded.
Next you'll want to marry a
high caste girl.
Too big for your boots.
Calm down
I will never marry. Happy?
Try these Bollywood lines
on your office intern.
I am your father.
You good-for-nothing.
- Calm down.
- Why?
You've spoilt him rotten.
The office atmosphere is peculiar.
People play cards, trim their nails.
They just pass time.
No file moves without a bribe.
Everyone thinks like you at first.
Soon you'll be like them
I'm not there to make money.
A call centre would pay more.
I want to make a difference
Newton, you know your problem?
My honesty?
No.
Your arrogance about your honesty
Newton, your honesty is not doing
the world a favor.
It is expected of you.
Honesty makes the heart lighter,
less burdened.
The office is closing.
Keep working with your
honesty intact.
The country will progress alongside.
Kamal, here's the ink
...the strip seal, stamp...
...chalk, wax and carbon.
Here. It's all on this list.
- Sir, you've forgotten the green seal.
- Sorry. Here.
- The rule book.
- No need. I know it by heart.
He's bright. Don't need to
tell him anything.
Kamal Kishore, you look smart.
Know how to work it?
We keep the control unit.
The balloting unit is...
...is used by the voters.
- Know where you're going?
- Booth no. 148
Kondanar.
Very first elections there.
Only 76 voters.
No problem, sir. We have a booth
for one voter in Gir jungle.
Really?
This is Dandakaranya,
not Gir jungle.
It has a strong Maoist presence.
The violence was 6 months ago.
It's under our control now.
You'll get full security.
Two officers and a local BLO
to help you.
You'll fly by helicopter.
But I'm deputed to the City Hall?
- Who said so?
- Mr. Bansilal.
Do I make the list? Or does he?
You make the list, ma'am
I've just got married.
My wife is pregnant.
- I am a heart patient.
- A heart patient?
Did you hear that?
A heart patient.
The doctor has told me
not to fly.
Your medical certificate?
I'll bring it in an hour.
No, half an hour.
Mr. Meshram, can someone
from Reserves go?
I'll check, ma'am.
In the jungle...
...logic doesn't work.
Only instinct.
Didn't 19 people die in
the last election?
Not just here, but throughout
the county.
Elections are being held here
after years.
We'll know the casualties numbers
tomorrow.
Sir, there's a river 3-4 km away.
- Pakistan is up ahead.
- Pakistan?
The Maoists.
Their red flag flew here
till last August.
Wherever I've been posted,
people have saluted other flags.
Flags and floggings make nations.
Correct.
Why do you call the Maoist area
"Pakistan?"
God knows.
They called it that before my time.
Enemy means Pakistan.
Was this area under
Maoist control?
Now we control it.
But it's still dangerous.
Land mines everywhere.
Mind where you pee.
Might set off a land mine.
Why look at me?
You think I'll pee?
No, I'm just telling you.
I have diabetes. I might need
to go.
This is our camp.
Don't worry, we're safe here.
What time do we leave for duty?
The Asst. Commandant will
brief you at breakfast.
That's our mess.
Your tent is on that side.
Sir, careful.
Don't wander about at night.
There are scorpions and snakes.
Mr. Newton.
Mr. Loknath
Shambhu, wake up!
Loknath sir.
Get up! It's 4am
Shambhu, let's go.
Got any toothpaste?
Ask when he's coming.
He's on his way, sir.
Hello, Mr. Kumar
Atma Singh. Assistant Commandant
I'm Newton Kumar.
Upper Division Clerk,
Collector's Office
Loknath and Shambhu.
We're together.
When do we leave?
- Where to?
- Kondanar. For the voting.
Voting.
You eat eggs?
Eggs?
Wild fowl eggs. Our hens are
revolutionaries too
I had to interrogate them
for hours to get them out.
Want some? A tonic for bravery.
Let's go after breakfast.
It's enough that you've
made it this far.
It's unsafe beyond here.
My men will get the votes.
Ma'am said it's been
quiet for 6 months.
Really?
Didn't she tell you...
...about the Maoist operation
that took place 6 months ago?
If the area was safe, why are
we playing hide-n-seek here?
This is how elections are conducted
in sensitive areas
I have conducted elections in
Srinagar and Manipur.
But I'm the presiding officer.
Is the school where we'll install
the booth 8km away?
That's correct.
After the police operation,
the villagers were...
...sent to camps near the city.
- It's your area, your call.
- Please.
Let me do my duty.
There are 76 voters who live
around here.
Their votes are important.
Mr. Newton, they don't care
about the elections.
They're illiterate villagers.
And the Maoists have ordered them
not to vote
I'll give it to you in writing,
no one will vote.
Write it down then. I'll submit
it to the Collector's office
Jayesh!
Bulletproof jacket.
Let's hurry.
Government goods. Tie it tight,
that's if you want to live.
Who is this?
Sir, she's the BLO.
How did she get inside?
How did she?
She's one of our team.
Checked her ID?
Your name?
Malko. Malko Netam.
- You can't come with us.
- What?
- She must. She's a team member.
- I decide that.
You're not coming. Go.
The rule says a BLO
has to be present.
You're coming.
You don't get it. You can't trust
the locals.
You don't get it.
She's in our team. She's coming
with us.
- Do we give her a BP jacket?
- Yes
Yashwant! A bulletproof jacket
for madam.
I don't want it.
It's safer
I'm a local. I'm safer without one.
Take mine off then.
No. You're not a local.
- You have the voters list?
- Yes.
- Is it updated?
- The best I could do.
You have copies?
Hemant, give them their crowns.
Crowns?
Helmets.
Must we?
You'll walk in the centre.
The boys will spread out.
Let's go.
What is it?
Get up!
Sir
- I have to go.
- That's what we're doing
I mean I need to take a dump.
Why didn't you go at the camp?
I'm unlucky. I have to work hard
for small rewards.
A bunch of clowns.
Let him go, it's an emergency.
Let me help.
Do I look like a kid who needs help?
Halt!
How many times will you go?
A yogi goes once, a pleasure-seeker twice.
The ailing goes 3 times.
What are you, sir?
A pleasure-seeker.
Leave me alone. A little privacy,
please.
What can I say?
- He was on the phone all night.
- Talking to the girlfriend?
Lakhma, where are they going?
To gather Tendu leaves.
Bring them here.
Get their votes.
No, it doesn't work like that.
Voting has rules.
Without voter cards, they can't vote
Lakhma, ask them if they have
voter cards.
Listen.
Do you know it is election day?
You know about the elections?
Yes, we know.
We'll set up the booth at the
Kondanar School. Come there.
We'll come.
You must all come.
- Does everyone have a voter card?
- Yes.
Bring them with you. Don't forget.
We'll wait there. You must come
Rajman, explain it in Gondi.
- They might not show up.
- Why not?
They were told in Gondi that
voting stops at 11:30am.
Wait!
Voting stops at 3pm, not 11.30.
Come anytime before that.
You must come.
By 3. Not 11:30. Please translate.
Your man was lying to them.
Where is your old man?
What happened?
Six voters came but Newton
did not take their votes.
How could I?
6 out of 76 voters showed up.
That's a 7.5% turnout.
How was your turnout?
Thanks to you, it was 100%.
Did you play cricket as a kid?
Yes.
Batsman, or bowler?
Umpire.
Thought as much.
What's your opinion of
the Maoists?
No opinion.
That's why they sent me here.
Good.
You're intelligent. Why didn't you sit for
the civil service exam?
- I did, but I failed.
- Thought as much.
Do you know the capital of
Nagaland?
Kohima.
- Manipur?
- Imphal.
- Kashmir?
- Srinagar.
Seen any of those cities?
No.
Listen.
I have.
Hold it.
Heavy, right?
The nation's burden.
It's on our shoulders.
Keep moving.
Wait
I'm the only one asking questions
in this jungle. OK?
Sir, are you related to some
government big shot?
No.
You must know someone influential.
No, why?
Sure you do.
No one has the guts to talk
to a police officer like that.
Tell me. Am I right?
I won't tell anyone.
Keep walking.
Mr. Atma Singh.
Who burned their homes?
- The villagers are safe in camps.
- Who set the village on fire?
Does it matter? There's peace.
Everything is in control.
Whose idea was it to do this?
You're here for the elections.
Do your research later.
This is the school.
Lakhma, put everything inside.
Put it inside.
Oh God! What is this place?
What is this?
How can we conduct elections here?
Didn't you survey the place?
Yes.
I described it accurately.
Well, we can't set up here.
As per the rule book...
...the presiding officer can conduct
elections anywhere.
I told you not to come.
Let's have tea and head back
Lakhma! Tea for everyone.
Sir, this way? Please.
I am 59. You made me run
8kms
I have diabetes, asthma.
My cholesterol is high.
Will you make me run back?
If we have a good breakfast,
it'll help.
No one cares if elections
are held or not.
Did the Maoists write this?
If you burn their homes,
anger is natural.
Sir, what shall we do?
Decide soon, please.
Where shall I put all this?
Take it out.
Clear it all away.
Let's make do.
Decide the entry and exit.
They enter here. Here's your table.
Put a table here.
Let's follow the rules.
Listen to me.
- The entry is always to the left.
- Why not here?
Keep the booth here!
And my table here.
- Mr. Loknath, show me.
- How many times must I?
- Oh no! These mosquitoes...
- Get to the point.
The voters walk this way.
They come to me. Then to him.
They press the button.
Twirl their moustache proudly
and go
Nabi, you're on sentry duty.
- You're on OP duty.
- Ok, sir.
- Clear, everyone?
- Yes, sir.
He's coming out.
Yes?
Acting all friendly now.
What does your name mean?
- Malko means playful.
- Playful?
You're a teacher, right?
What do you teach?
I teach young kids. So everything.
Do you like teaching?
It's not easy. The children
speak Gondi.
And the textbooks are in Hindi.
I try my best to explain in Gondi.
They don't understand
the textbooks.
Anyway Hindi is outdated.
I was educated in Hindi, and now
see what I'm doing?
Teach them English. English.
Even puppies know English today.
Do you speak English?
I'm learning.
Adult education?
Adult? No, sir.
Watching films in English.
On my phone.
Return of Dracula, Bride of Chucky,
Seed of Chucky.
Brainy phone.
It's Chinese. It has everything.
- Are you married?
- No.
And you?
Good.
You?
In '83, I was going to have
a love marriage.
If her father hadn't made
such a big fuss...
...I would've had three kids by now.
Love marriages were not
the fashion then
Kamla was married off to
a rich old man.
That's terrible.
No, sir.
She's a rich widow now.
Doesn't care about me.
But I'm a writer. If I didn't suffer,
how would I write?
- A writer?
- Yes.
- What are you writing?
- Jungle stories.
A polling party come to the
jungle for the elections.
But they can't go home.
Why not?
The forest people who died
years ago are now Jombies.
Zombies.
Jombies. Bloodthirsty,
the living dead.
Rotting corpses.
Like the plot?
Dreadful.
Those films have corrupted
your imagination.
"When Samina heard about Ramju,
fear gripped her heart.
"She had never seen him.
"But every scary face
reminded her of him.
"One day she finally met Ramju.
"She was buying mangoes
at the bus stop...
"...a young man in a white shirt
stopped near the stall.
"His face was all scared from
knife cuts.
Mr. Loknath, put them away.
Not allowed.
It's an old custom playing cards
at the booth.
So is getting suspended.
Another old custom:
fortune-telling. May I?
Cut the deck.
Go on. Don't be scared.
Let's see your future.
- Not on my table.
- Please wait
1, 2, 3
This card is your past.
This is your present.
And this is your future.
- Choose one.
- What are you doing?
Two of Hearts, you're kind-hearted
Pick another.
The joker.
That's you today.
A joker?
A joker could be anyone.
Enough!
Go and sit down.
Sure! Prophecies frighten people.
Put the cards away
Shambhu! Get up.
Go and freshen up.
Matches?
20 rupees
20? Wow!
You must have a good hand
20 from me.
No, friends.
What have you got?
There's nothing to do here.
Just kill time.
- What's the price of land here?
- Why? Building a house?
I want to invest.
- Surrender instead.
- Surrender?
Turn yourself in with a pistol,
you'll get 200,000 rupees.
Surrender with this, you'll
get 500,000.
With an AK-47, it's 1.5 million
rupees.
You find the guns. We'll do the rest
and split 50-50.
But I am not a Maoist.
The police know that.
That's why they'll pay you.
- Freshened up? It was quick.
- No choice.
- You should've washed your clothes too.
- There was no soap.
You washed your face without
soap?
You could've used the leaves
of the Ritha tree.
Didn't see it
Lakhma.
Where is Mr. Atma Singh?
- Where is Mr. Atma Singh?
- On a field exercise.
Great catch!
You'll have to run a kilometer.
How far are the settlements?
Shubham, help this gentleman.
One is behind the hill, 1.5km.
The other is 1km away.
They aren't showing up
because of the boycott.
Can you bring the voters here safely?
- That's impossible.
- Why?
I am the presiding officer. You must
obey my orders.
Yes, within 200m. Not beyond that.
We have our procedures too.
Hey Rajman.
No, thanks.
It's nothing personal.
Worried about zero voting?
I won't let that happen.
My men will vote.
Who wants to vote?
See? They are all keen.
Is that your idea? I won't allow
any cheating.
You talk about cheating.
There are almost 70 voters
in these villages.
Politicians? Not even a polling agent
has come.
No one from any Party.
And you talk about cheating.
I don't know about that.
I'm just doing my duty.
How old are you? I'm 40.
And you?
What's that got to do with it?
Just changing the subject.
OK
What is 2 plus 2, divided by 2?
Two?
Three.
You talk of rules and forget
the basic one.
Division comes before addition.
You won't send your men?
Sorry. Rules.
Mr. Newton, do you have
a motorcycle?
No
I'm buying one next month.
A Honda.
Can I ask you something?
Don't mind.
Go on.
Say you work the same hours,
but your salary doubles.
I don't take bribes.
You've got me wrong, sir.
There's a scheme.
Pay 500 rupees.
Then find ten others who pay
500 each.
You'll earn more with every new
member. A chain is created.
You'll mint money, sitting at home.
The scheme guys will explain
everything over a free lunch.
Chicken and all sorts are served.
A lady from Sukma bought a Sony
phone in two months.
The touchscreen type.
We are all doing our duty
Atma Singh must have seen
other elections.
But these are different
I understand that.
Guys like him don't shake
without being shaken...
...but they don't stop once shaken.
He is a Jombie now.
Must I do nothing?
Let's none of us do anything
I've sprayed tons of repellent but
these bloodsuckers won't stop
I'm shivering.
They're local bloodsuckers.
Repellent is useless.
Try our remedy.
What?
You won't get malaria.
Will you make me eat herbs?
He had better not get cerebral malaria.
What's your remedy?
No, sir.
The bites will soon disappear.
What is she doing?
Must he chew the leaves?
An ant's nest. The ants must bite him.
- Bite whom?
- You.
They'll bite you and you'll sweat.
You won't get malaria.
Pull up your shirt.
No, no. I'm already sweating.
Sir, stop her!
- A few bites and you'll be ok.
- It'll save you from malaria.
It won't hurt.
Are they edible?
It's sour.
We make them into a chutney.
Very tasty.
Interesting.
What's interesting is that you live
a few hours away...
...yet know nothing about life here.
Is that someone singing?
- What's going on?
- Interrogation.
About what?
They were climbing trees,
playing.
They were spying to see how
many men we were.
"How many men?" You think you're
in an action movie like "Sholay?"
The Maoists even use toddlers.
Not true.
Who's asking you?
- You're one of them.
- One second.
You can't talk to her like that.
If they're spies, why make them
sing?
You prefer I beat them up?
- Ask them if they saw anything.
- No.
Hear that? The answer came out
like a shot.
Pretends he doesn't speak Hindi.
Hey Mowgli, come here.
What are you doing?
Go!
Tell everyone in the village
to come and vote. Go.
It's all for your benefit, sir.
You sound threatening.
Mr. Newton...
In uniform, a request sounds like
a threat.
They aren't your slaves
Newton, stay a Newton.
Don't try to be an Einstein.
We're leaving soon.
More ambushes at night.
Get back to your duty.
Let's go.
What time did we first meet
Atma Singh?
- Around 4:30 or 4:45am.
- 4:30 or 4:45?
Probably 4:45.
When did we leave?
Don't know.
I got there at 5:30.
Are you filing a complaint?
Why raise your blood pressure?
We know the elections mean
a lot to you.
But only one thing changes:
the framed portraits of our leaders.
Who cares if people starve or not,
voting is a more important right!
Are you a pessimist like him?
No. I'm an Adivasi,
a "tribal".
What's going on?
Go back to duty.
Run!
What a pain.
How did you end up in this jungle?
Couldn't pull any strings?
I wanted to sit in a helicopter.
- Mr. Newton, Digcent is on the line.
- Who?
The DIG, sir
Newton Kumar.
How many votes?
Zero votes.
It's not going well.
I tried telling Atma...
Hello. Listen to me.
The voters will come.
I spoke to Atma Singh
I'm on my way...
...with some foreign journalists.
Remember, my reputation is at stake
Clear?
Your WhatsApp profile is good
I thought you were blonde.
Krishna's unit will go down the hill.
My men will go the other way.
Mr. Newton, may we go?
Don't force anyone to come.
Let them come voluntarily.
Force them? Tell us and we'll
leave our guns here.
One unit stays here to protect
the booth.
Get up!
Move it.
Stop listening to their excuses.
Get them together in 5 minutes.
Where are you going?
Fill it up.
Hurry up!
- Do you know Hindi?
- A little.
How many villagers have
voting cards?
- What's that?
- He says "40".
Tell him to bring his card
and convince the others. OK?
Do you have a voting card?
Card? Go and get it.
Cook the fat one. Make it spicy.
Do you have a voting card?
Come on!
Stop!
We're taking the voters with us.
Get going!
Do you know the history
of this place?
Dandakaranya Forest.
Know what it means?
"The Forest of Punishment."
Where it's given and served.
Sita and Rama were exiled here
Surpanakha's nose was cut off here.
Sita crossed the line drawn
by Lakshman.
She was kidnapped by Ravan
and taken to Sri Lanka.
Lots of history here.
You are too young to have seen
the TV serial Ramayana.
The mythical aircraft, Pushpak?
It flew from here.
- From here?
- Yes. See that clearing?
Doesn't it look like a runway?
India's first pilot was Ravan.
Of Sri Lanka?
Sri Lanka and India were the same
country then.
He flew her straight to Sri Lanka.
What are you staring at?
People with a voting card,
raise your hands.
The ones with the card, go over there.
Only they can vote.
Where are the young?
Gone to pick Tendu leaves.
- When will they be back?
- By lunch.
Sit over there.
They're all old. Where are
the young ones?
They've gone to work.
We found this lot, so we
dragged them here.
- Dragged them here?
- No, sir.
They came voluntarily
The others have been informed.
They'll come after lunch.
Get in line.
Everyone, in line. Hurry
Malko, Loknath. Shall we start?
Go ahead, start.
Name?
Sukku
Sukku Ram.
Number MZZ...
Please come.
What's her name?
Komaldai.
Number 19.
Cast your vote.
What?
He's just standing there.
Maybe it's the first time he's seen
a machine.
Nor have his ancestors!
He's dumbstruck.
Listen to me carefully.
Cast your votes, one by one.
See this? A machine like this
is inside that room.
The machine will register your vote.
There's a button next to
each candidate's name.
Press the button for the person
you want to vote for.
OK?
Please translate.
- How much money do we get?
- Shut up!
Voting is your birthright.
You won't be paid. Nor will you
be forced to vote.
Understand?
Any questions?
Don't be scared. Ask.
How does voting benefit them?
This is the country's biggest election.
Don't you want roads, electricity,
water and social justice?
The man you vote for will make all
this happen.
He'll bring improvements.
"This jungle is more dangerous
than beautiful.
"We could be ambushed.
"An IED or a land mine could explode.
"So it's a big deal that elections are
being held under these circumstances.
"With cameraman Israr Ahmed
"I am Vinod for S News,
Kondanar."
Parliament is where important laws
of this land are passed.
It's in Delhi.
The candidate you choose...
We have our own laws.
Thousands of years old.
Please cooperate and translate.
Tell them that the man they vote for
will go to Delhi.
They say he's their leader,
he can go to Delhi.
You can't go to Delhi, you aren't
standing in the elections.
Show them the list.
Choose someone from this list
and cast your vote.

Here are the names.
First time they've heard these names.
Which candidate will give them
a fair price for Tendu leaves?
They say if they vote, the Maoists
will trouble them...
...or the police will.
No one asks what they want.
What do they want?
Freedom from both.
Did they say that?
Sir, should I handle it?
Loknath, two minutes. Let me explain
Two minutes.
After the elections...
Mr. Newton, this is beyond you.
Now let me take over.
Shame on you people!
These gentlemen have come
to this jungle...
...risking their lives for you.
What?
Just wait.
Must you treat them like this?
Please wait.
- The voting machine is like a toy.
- What nonsense! It is not a toy.
- What are you saying?
- Be quiet.
- These are your first elections.
- So what?
You can't get their vote,
and obstruct others who can.
You're the obstructive one.
I will report you.
Go on. Write up your report.
Krishna, take him away.
This toy is easy to play with.
It has everything.
A carrot, a ship, a motorcycle,
an animal, a flower.
A mug.
Press the button of the picture you like.
We're not children.
He's right. You can't talk to
them like that.
- Go away!
- Why?
I am the presiding officer.
I'm in control
I've heard that all day.
Control, what control?
He says, "I'm the Headman and
village judge. I'll settle your dispute".
You'll settle it?
Please wait.
Start the procedure.
They're coming. We're running
out of time.
A faraway destination.
A slow pace.
Flying dust.
Reddened eyes.
A long straight road.
Decided to turn its course.
Having seen you.
The bird has flown away.
Ask your questions,
one by one.
Some people say the atmosphere of fear
benefits the mining companies.
People will be displaced.
The companies will take over.
That's what Maoist sympathizers say.
They are the root problem.
Did the administration burn
these villages?
Were you scared coming here?
Sir, the Maoists...
...you talk about are forced
to surrender...
...and forced to fight other Maoists.
What's the logic?
Durjan. Tukaram. Come here!
Tell them - were these weapons
forced on you?
No, sir.
Did you put any pressure
on the villagers?
What do you hope for?
How will the elections change your life?
There'll be no change.
- You don't think so?
- No, no change.
Why not?
Somewhat united.
Mostly divided.
Bursting with air.
The balloon burst.
A new page stitched itself
into the story.
Having seen you.
The bird has flown away.
Who heard what?
Who said what?
It was a half-done night.
The final count?
39 out of 76.
We need to visit other booths.
How long will you stay?
Till 3pm.
Why? Who's coming?
Some voters said they'd come
after lunch.
It wouldn't be right
if we left early.
What if a voter shows up?
There's still time.
You've no idea what's going on
here.
What do you mean? Violence?
- Booth capturing? Phony votes?
- No.
Elections have their charm
I'm glad this is my last.
This was no election.
Voting for anyone.
Is that an election?
So? You should've stopped it.
You saw. The procedure was
followed.
You've been preaching all day.
Trying to teach people civics
Malko, let's eat.
Mr. Loknath
I'm going.
Never seen a specimen like you
in 30 years of duty. Come.
Mr. Newton, you're educated
and knowledgeable.
Don't mind if I say something.
What you saw today has been
our life.
Great change does not come in a day.
Even the jungle took years to grow.
You want to add something?
I have a solution to stop
the injustice here.
- What's that?
- TV.
- TV?
- TV for everyone.
Greed means nothing to them.
Greed is an alien concept.
They need TVs.
When they see Coca Cola
and washing machine ads...
...they'll forget about the revolution
and fall in line.
Wow! You're quite the intellectual.
Can anyone stop the sun
from rising?
Red salad!
Food for everyone.
- What is it?
- A local recipe.
Won't madam eat with us?
She's sulking.
Ask these boys to vote.
They're not even 16.
The first time I voted
I was 14.
Back home, teenagers pass off
as candidates.
- Where's home?
- Never mind.
How is the chicken?
It's from a kilometer away
Lakhma!
As per the rules, I can't come in.
Feel bad seeing you like this.
The situation was beyond our control.
We both had a job to do
I'd feel guilty if you didn't eat.
What was that?
Don't move. Stay put!
- What happened?
- Hurry!
Stay down.
Sir, it's an ambush.
Take your stuff and go.
Hurry up!
Take them to the highway.
Mr. Newton, take the machine.
They're attacking us.
Come out, hurry.
Krishna's men will take you
to the highway.
Thank you.
Krishna, go!
This path will lead you home.
- Will you manage?
- Yes.
How will she go?
We'll take her home.
No, sir, I can manage.
We can take you back.
She'll be fine. I can send someone
with her.
There's no need.
There's no need. I'll go.
- Sure.
- Yes.
Here's the register
Malko ma'am, keep this pen.
How will you turn your pupils
into tigers?
See? Sir's third card of fortune.
A five.
It's useless.
A king, queen or ace is good.
No, Mr. Loknath. This is a five.
And this is six.
She means the sixth sense.
She's explaining it to you.
That's if he can understand.
Ok, sir.
Mr. Loknath, you're a writer, right?
What do you think of the story
we were told?
Story? What story?
At first they said it was unsafe.
We shouldn't come.
When we got here,
it seemed safe to me.
No one came to vote at first.
As soon as the media showed up,
so did the voters.
They said leave after tea.
Then it was - leave after lunch.
An ambush takes place as soon
as lunch is over.
Intriguing story, no?
I should write it up.
Krishna.
- A good story?
- Meaning, sir? I don't get it.
Let's keep walking.
There was a dangerous ambush.
But no message to say
all is well.
Sir, I'll just check.
Where did all the curry go?
Come along, sir.
Sir, please come.
Stop, sir.
Where are you going, sir?
Sir, why are you screwing up your job?
Sir, let's talk.
Don't make me run.
If I have to run, I'll thrash you.
Don't make me run!
What is this nonsense?
Where to?
The booth.
At it again?
You're a fraud.
They're back
I've caught the ghost.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
I'm here to vote.
No. There is no voting here.
- No.
- There are only four of them.
Get rid of them.
Please wait.
Stop!
Put that gun down!
Have you gone mad?
Put it down!
It might go off by accident.
Put your guns down!
Down, I said.
Down!
Wait. Nothing will happen to you.
Cast your vote.
Mr. Loknath, set up the booth.
Everyone, get back.
Set up the machine. Get their votes.
Go on. Get it done.
You want them to vote. So go.
Put the machine here.
- Know how to sign?
- Yes.
- Your name?
- Trilok.
Check their voting cards.
Put the gun down.
You'll lose your job.
Let's talk it over.
We're on the same side.
- Put it down.
- Shut up!
Election officers don't look good
with guns.
Get back.
Back!
OK
- Start the process.
- Yes.
Sign here.
- What's your name?
- Chandani.
- Know who you're voting for?
- Yes.
Don't need to tell me.
Why did you fake an ambush?
- Why?
- Did I have a choice?
I've been telling you all day -
this area is unsafe.
We've asked for night vision goggles
for 2 years.
Brave men are dying.
Can't take a risk for your
election picnic.
It's not a picnic.
It's my duty.
Mr. Loknath.
- Done?
- Yes.
You can leave now.
Let's take the stuff.
Step back!
Sign here.
Two minutes to go.
Two minutes to 3. Wait.
Take your time. Let's wait.
Have they left?
Did they cast their vote?
A pen.
Take your time. We won't budge.
- Stay still.
- There's no hurry.
Take your time.
OK?
Done?
Ok. Shall I take the gun?
Your total is 3450 rupees.
Wait. Let's do something.
We'll buy the olive oil next month.
No, no. Take it now.
Where is Newton Kumar?
That way
Newton sir!
- What happened to your neck?
- Malko! Please come.
What brings you here?
I had some work. I heard you
worked here too.
What happened to your neck?
A reaction to my action.
It's much better now. I wear this
for safety.
- And how are you?
- Fine.
How is your school?
The school is fine too.
What about you?
You can see.
I got an award for punctuality.
Wow!
The department awarded you?
You see I'm always on time.
The office starts at nine,
and I'm here on the dot.
People think it's a big deal.
Hence the award.
Sir, an honest officer should
be awarded.
Don't know about honesty.
I'm just doing my duty.
An award for honesty involves
the greatest dishonesty.
- The election has changed you a lot.
- No
I haven't changed one bit.
I'm just the same.
Was everything ok after I left?
A long story. I'll tell you over tea
some day.
Let's have tea now.
Five minutes before the next break.
Can you wait?
Yes.
Let me finish this.
I am glad you came.
