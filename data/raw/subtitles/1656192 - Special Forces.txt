No way I agreed to that!
I couldn't have said yes. No way!
I was meeting mom.
Sure.
Your mom hates me.
Don't slam the door, please.
Hate? No.
She thinks you're immature.
I'm not immature.
You're not?
Go easy on the door.
It's a heap of stinking metal!
- He doesn't know?
- No.
Am I immature?
Immature?
Cut it out.
What's the problem?
Lisa wants us to live together.
What?
After only 5 years together?
I know.
The time's flown by.
I'll have to sell the car.
Then we'll get a Labrador.
Then decorate a bedroom...
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks.
KABUL Hotel Merindi
This compass saved a unit's lives
in the Normandy Landings.
It's a museum piece.
We all chipped in to buy it.
Happy birthday, brother.
Salemani?
Back up!
Don't shoot!
Seen Jacques?
Right there.
PARIS Elsa Casanova's newsroom
Foreign Minister for you.
Yes, Jacques Beauregard.
Good morning, Minister.
Sorry?
What?
- What's up?
- No idea.
Yes, sir.
Right away.
Elsa's been abducted by the Taliban.

Can our intelligence expert
tell us more?
Zaief is a fanatic.
Totally unpredictable.
I want her back alive.
Is that clear?
Do we have any idea where they are?
In his tribal stronghold,
Zaief thinks he's untouchable.
We can send in
a special forces unit.
- How many men?
- Around sixty.
How soon?
Some have already taken off,
Mr. President.
AFGHANISTAN Wardak Province
Your chopper.
We'll send your gear on.

Gandamak Camp
See the fat guy over there?
Let's play a joke on him.
My method is simple.
One line on the left,
one line on the right.
If you step out of line,
I set you straight. My way.
You're all gonna learn
to spit thunder out front
and fart lightning out behind.
Back in this shithole.
Air Force boy on beach vacation?
He's with us.
What?
Victor, put your pop gun away.
The boss is here. He's waiting.
What's with the t-shirt?
- I got you one. Kiddie size.
- You did?
My canary!
You're my little canary!
Commander! Captain!
Commander!
Gentlemen.
Yes, we have a new sniper.
New and never been fucked.
Distance record?
I killed a rabbit at 253 meters.
Okay!
Murderer!
As usual,
there's good and bad news.
Rabbit's on the menu.
The bad news...
The hostages are in Pakistan.
In the tribal areas.
Happy birthday!
The good news is
it's only reconnaissance.
For once, we're in the front row,
not on stage.
Questions?
For your information,
Casanova opposes our presence here.
Any other questions?
Yeah.
Is she pretty?
Bring in Salemani.
CHARLES DE GAULLE

ADMIRAL GUEZENNEC
Special Operations Command
Permission to board, captain?
Permission granted, admiral.
Weather reports every half-hour.
When they take off,
I gotta talk to Kovax.
12 hours later
- Enough, turn it off.
- He's sick.
No French woman will be decapitated
for the world to see.
How long before your men
can intervene?
24 hours.
In that case, we've lost.
Perhaps not.
We have an ace up our sleeves.
That's the situation.
Slight change of plans.
The chances of success?
There are no guarantees
with ops like this.
That's why they're special.
Permission to proceed.
Double ammo time.
What's that?
We'll give it a shot.
Open payload!

MULLAH ZUKHAN
Taliban Spiritual Leader
By the almighty Prophet, welcome.
Greetings, men of the Shura.
He didn't kill her.
Many of our brothers think
you can't be trusted.
On what grounds?
They say you work for your own glory
rather than to achieve God's will.
I'm the Shura's loyal servant.
She's like those impure sluts
he frequented in London.
Women are the weak point
of the West.
Don't be taken in again.
If this woman is to die,
it's a sign she must go
to meet Allah.
Don't disappoint me.
Is it me
or are they multiplying?
There's not enough of us.
Shut it, Tic Tac.
Tell us where they are.
Satellite dishes
and barred windows...
That's their holiday home.
Movement, 3 o'clock.
What are they doing?
Stay put.
We just watch?
Yes.
Why?
That's not why we're here.
Not why we're here.
Showtime!
Elias,
you with us?
Right here.
On 3.
1...
2...
3!
Clear!
French army!
Keep calm!
Hi!
Elsa Casanova?
Amin Takharoud?
Turn around!
- Got that?
- Yes.
- They know we're here.
- Out!
Head down.
I'm unhurt!
Get over here!
They're coming in from all sides.
Contact rear!
Go!
Elias, fall back.
If you can hear me, fall back.
I'll hold them off
and catch you up.
What's going on here?
Sir!
Commandos came to rescue them!
We lost 2 radio bags.
This one's dead.
The choppers'll be there.
Show me your arm.
Look after her.
Rest assured, it'll be fine.
You follow me.
It's easier if you hold my pack.
Come on, take my hand.
Let's go.
Any tighter, I'll punch you.
Swarming with sharks.
GPS?
36 north 72 east.
We can dodge them that way.
But we won't make the pick-up.
The distress signal?
The Taliban might locate it.
They already located us.
You and Marius go ahead.
- Where are we going?
- Later. We gotta move.
Look who it is...
He's made some new friends.
It's the whole Mexican army!
C'mon, buddy.
- What's he doing?
- Winding them up.
They're playful.
Wait...
Wait...
NOW!
I don't know why...
I hesitate more and more
about pushing a button.
It's getting obsessive.
I'll mention it to my shrink.
Shut up and press, captain.
Yes, Marius.
Can I help?
I'll change the dressing.
It needs closing up.
Sure.
Of course.
We're 22 km from the pick-up.
On top of the world's asshole.
There are ladies present.
Sorry, it must be the emotion.
By the way,
I'm not very good at sewing.
Ready?
Okay?
Fine.
A distress signal.
20 km from the pick-up.
Moving?
Negative.
We're 30 minutes ahead.
- The choppers?
- They'll go to the pick-up first.
You Okay?
We haven't eaten for 3 days.
Tell her to take her time.
Lucas took your article to heart.
The military doesn't like criticism.
They patch you up?
She did.
- Really?
- Wipe that smile off.
- Your analysis was interesting.
- Thanks.
I didn't say I agreed.
Good or bad,
politics isn't our concern.
Lively down there.
What's going on?
Our taxis catching shit.
Gaining. 10 minutes behind.
Shit.
Pick-up's screwed.
They failed.
Nobody at the pick-up zone.
A chopper crash-landed,
with one man seriously wounded.
The hostages?
No news of the commandos
for 3 hours.
DAY 2
Let's rest up,
she can't take any more.
Break time.
You have a Plan B?
No, there's no Plan B.
What's he plan on doing?
I don't know.
Looking at him, we won't like it.
Here, captain.
Victor.
Well? What's the plan?
For Afghanistan,
we have one entry.
And it's right there.
You're completely nuts.
We're here to get you back
and we will.
Anybody got a better idea?
One hour of glory
beats an eternity of anonymity.
Their chances get slimmer
by the hour.
Until proven otherwise,
we keep looking.
I want everybody to stay alert.
How did you wind up here?
By parachute.
You know what I mean.
At last!
I wondered
when the journalist would resurface.
What do you want to know?
How I wound up
with these boneheads in uniform?
No, I didn't mean that.
Sure.
We're not all Nobel prizewinners.
But you guys neither.
Are you married?
Not right now.
Biscuits with your tea?
- What?
- We'll never make it.
You'd rather sit and wait?
I hope you've called this right.
Me too.
You were very brave.
That's not bravery.
Bravery
is that woman in the village.
Before her execution,
she raised her burqa.
Know what she did then?
She smiled at them.
And What did I do?
Nothing at all.
Sorry,
I'm not much good at chatting.
You Okay?
Sure.
DAY 3
Tic Tac.
I'm on it.
Is he trustworthy?
What?
Is he trustworthy, yes or no?
The Taliban massacred his family.
Good enough?
Thanks.
I believe breakfast is served.
- They won't drop it.
- They like you too much.
Elsa, why won't he let it go?
It became personal.
Sorry, I don't understand.
They're getting bigger here.
He can't lose face.
He'll do anything to get me.
It gets better and better.
Pay no attention.
Go on.
Straight up,
3 days running from these jerks...
Yeah, aren't you sick of it?
Contact front!
Reload!
Lead!
Turn around! Go back!
Turn around!
They're devils!
Go back up there!
Why?
The Hindu Kush
will vanquish the woman.
Go back and kill her!
Oakley!
Western women
are stronger than you think.
Go on! Catch them!
Go back!
DAY 4
They're massacring us.
"The reasons behind a fiasco."
"Defense indefensible."
If we did nothing,
it'd be the same.
Six guys are out there,
trying to bring her home.
Friend or enemy?
The next peak's 5,000 meters.
We won't make it
without food and clothing.
What the hell are they doing?
Next time, I tie you up.
Indoctrination in the madrassas.
The children come home
to impose sharia law.
No wonder they dislike them.
- What do you think?
- Yeah, that one.
It's a deal.
This one, too.
- We'll take them all.
- They're great.
- Come and get it!
- Give me that!
There you go, friend.
Suits you better.
Get down!
Hide!
Take cover!
Get up!
He's dead! Victor, move it!
Let go!
He's dead!
DAY 5
I'm going with him.
We can't just let them go.
No martyrs! It's pointless.
Their hospitality's gonna
get them killed.
So what?
We've already lost Marius
because of a dumb-ass journalist.
We're not dying for some hicks.
The dumb-ass journalist
would rather stay with the hicks.
Negative!
Lucas, stay with your new friend.
We're going humanitarian.
We're delighted
to have you in our village.
Everybody wishes you a warm welcome.
Where is she?
Find her!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.
You never know.
He loved this gun.
For Marius.
Can't you hear the gunfire?
Find them!
- I ever say I love this job?
- No, never.
Victor!
Fuck!
Victor's down! Fall back!
Grab hold!
Reload!
Amin's dead.
Reload.
Go, I'll cover you.
I'll be okay.
Go on!
Shit!
Take it easy!
Put him down there.
Can you do a tourniquet?
It hurts!
Put your hands there.
Press down hard.
Amin?
Hang in there.
Tough it out.
- We wait for Elias?
- No.
Why not?
Let's take five!
Leave me.
Leave me here.
Sure, when you stop breathing.
Until then, hang in there.
I Will.
We'll never make it.
What's the altitude?
3,800 - 3,900.
It's starting to snow.
The temperature's falling.
It ain't good.
We need a shelter.
Victor, let's go.
Elsa, take my blanket.
C'mon, man! That's good.
Good man!
DAY 6
He's having convulsions.
Pin him down.
Hold his legs.
I've got him.
- More morphine?
- No way.
It'd kill him.
He's suffocating.
Get his jaw open.
That's good, Victor. Come on!
Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
You're as scared as me!
And I don't even hate you!
You Okay?
I was far away, huh?
What matters is you're back.
Tic Tac lost his wife 9 years ago.
I'd like him to be happy.
Rest.
DAY 7
What are you doing?
How many dead before you see
you'll never be back for them?
Who's next, you or me?
What do you want?
Stop!
Stop it!
You never listen!
I'm staying here.
Do you have children?
No.
We're taking you home
and you can have loads.
Listen up.
Lisa is pregnant.
Do me a favor,
make it home and take care of her.
I don't have kids either.
Is that an offer, captain?
I'm serious.
I'd really like to see you again.
I'm gonna be a dad?
Yes, buddy.
DAY 8
Shit!
Why'd she suffer in silence?
Out of respect.
She's got guts.
Ballsy.
Wait for her to faint to be nice.
Don't look.
It's okay.
You know Victor's last words?
"I love this job."
DAY 9
How'd you become a reporter
in a war zone?
By falling in love
with countries like this.
Choose Holland next time.
Why Holland?
It's flat.
Honestly,
how did you wind up here?
It was this or Holland.
Holland's cool.
Yeah, it's flat.
That's good.
Yeah, let's not talk about it.
Next time, I'll take you
to an Italian restaurant.
Neapolitan specialties.
Near my place.
You'll love it.
They make wonderful risottos.
Risotto with porcini mushrooms.
Maybe.
In another life.
It's not come to that yet.
Don't worry.
We'll make it.
Contact!
Take cover!
Lucas!
Are you okay?
Shit!
It'll be okay.
You'll make it.
It went too fast.
You'll be okay!
DAY 10
Shit, we've gone 3 km in 2 hours.
See the mountain we just crossed?
That's the border.
Move!
Pull!
Jesus!
I'll be okay.
Finish up without us.
Take it.
I'm not leaving you here.
Look at us.
We can't go any farther.
Please.
Take it.
Take this compass, too.
Take the compass.
Keep heading west.
West. Head west.
I can't leave you here.
You can
and you will.
I'm sorry, I can't.
If not for yourself,
do it for the others.
You have to make it
or all this means nothing.
Go home.
Go on.
Go on.
Go.
She's hot for me.
Sizzling.
I love the girl.
She'll make it.
I'm going home.
Anyway, you're all dead!
DAY 11
DAY 12
- Admiral!
- Yes?
She's alive.
- You'll be in Paris tomorrow.
- I won't leave Kabul.
Be reasonable.
You need treatment.
I'm staying till you get them.
These people are here
to look after you.
Sorry.
Please...
Excuse me.
- Climb up?
- Yes.
What's going on?
A quick flight and we'll be back.
Admiral!
Yes, I know, Minister.
Thank you.
For what? I should've found you.
For Jonathan and all French soldiers
fallen in Afghanistan.
And for all war reporters
who take risks covering the news
all over the globe.
