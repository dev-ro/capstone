I'll begin long before I existed.
When the time came for
my poor mama to be born...
my grandmother Anna Bronski...
who was still young
and unsuspecting...
was sitting in her four skirts
at the edge of a potato field.
That was in 1899...
in the heart of Kashubia.
Please!
He's gone.
Anybody come this way?
Name of Koljaiczek?
- A firebug.
- Short with broad shoulders.
I seen him! Running like
a bat out of hell!
Which way?
I don't believe it.
- Doesn't matter. He's gone.
- Must be in Bissau.
If he's not here,
it has to be one or the other.
There's no place else.
And besides, it's raining.
All right, Koljaiczek.
My name is Joseph.
Joseph and Anna hid
with the raftsmen...
for almost a year.
That's how long
it took the police to catch up...
with my grandfather.
Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot him!
- Fire at will!
After that dive...
Koljaiczek was never seen again.
Some say he was drowned...
some that he...
escaped to America...
and in Chicago,
under the name of Joe Colchic...
became a millionaire.
They say he made his pile in lumber...
in matches...
and in fire insurance.
As for my grandmother...
she sat year after year
in her four skirts...
hawking her wares in the market.
Geese!
Not too fat and not too lean!
And she grew older.
The First World War came...
and instead of geese...
she had only
turnips to sell.
Turnips!
My poor mother grew older too.
She was worried
about her cousin Jan.
Jan had been called up for duty.
- Name!
- Bronski, Jan.
- Year?.
- 1898.
Cough.
Rejected!
They've turned me down
for another year!
For the first time, my mother...
held her cousin Jan in her arms...
and I doubt...
if they ever embranced
more happily.
Sister Agnes, is there too much paprika?
Or does it need more clove?
What did she say?
She says you're a born cook,
Mr. Matzerath.
You know how to turn
feelings into soup.
The war had spent itself.
Danzig was declared a Free State.
The poles were given...
their own post office...
where Jan Bronski went to work.
Alfred Matzerath also
stayed in Danzig.
We Kashubians
have always been here.
Long before the Poles...
and naturally
long before the Germans.
Old stuff, Jan.
Now we've got peace!
Germans, Poles, Kashubians--
we'll all live together in peace.
I don't know.
Well, you'll see.
The two men, so different despite
their similar feelings for Mama...
liked each other...
and in that triunity,
they brought me, Oskar...
into the world.
The sun was in the sign of Virgo.
Neptune moved
into the house of middle life...
establishing Oskar
between faith and disillusion.
Push, push!
Push, Agnes, push!
Push hard!
It's coming! It's coming!
I first saw the light of this world...
in the form of a 60-watt bulb.
Alfred, it's a boy!
I knew it would be a boy...
even if I sometimes said
it would be a girl.
Let's see how much he weighs.
When he's big,
he'll take over the shop.
Now we know what
we're slaving for.
When little Oskar is
three years old...
he shall have a tin drum.
Only the prospect
of the tin drum prevented me...
from expressing more
forcefully my desire...
to return to the womb.
Besides, my umbilical cord
had been cut.
There was nothing
more to be done.
As it was, I could hardly wait
'til my third birthday.
What is it?
Oh, it's little Oskar!
Do you want some more cake?
Your mouth's filthy.
Respect the human body. That's--
And with rolls at 3 pfennings--
The main thing is a stable currency.
And plenty to drink!
Here's to the stable mark
and the 3-pfenning roll!
To youth!
And to beauty!
We won't be so young
when we meet again!
Love, oh love
is a power divine!
September 12...
1927.
Next year, you'll be this big!
And then, this big! And this.
And then as big as me!
Gangway!
Fresh from the celler!
- Playing, Mr. Scheffler?.
- Heavens, no!
Go ahead. I'll just watch.
Besides, it's my bedtime.
- He's always tired.
- You shouldn't have married a baker.
It's been a long time since Grandma
took anyone under her skirts.
Let's have a little game!
Hey, cousin, you're out of diamonds!
Don't argue! Play!
I have two diamonds myself.
How would I now?
That day...
thinking about the
grown-up world...
and my own future...
I decided to call a halt...
to stop growing then and there...
and remain a three-year-old...
a gnome, once and for all.
One, two, three.
God! There he is!
What happened?
He's fallen down the stairs!
Do something!
Why was the trap open?
He's bleeding!
Alfred, it's your fault.
You left the door open!
I was only getting beer
for everybody.
Run and get the doctor!
- It looks bad.
- You! You! It's your fault.
You left the trap open!
Stop! Stop!
Calm down!
What's done is done!
Two weeks in bed
and Oskar will be as good as new.
Just a slight concussion.
Plenty of cold compresses.
My fall was a complete success.
The family story was:
On his third birthday...
our little Oskar
fell down the cellar stairs.
No bones were broken,
but after that, he didn't grow--
not a single centimeter.
That drum again!
So loud!
So there's my little Oskar,
all well again.
Not in the house, I said!
Besides, it's broken.
You'll hurt yourself.
- Staying? There are mushrooms.
- Sorry. Post office time.
Leave the drum here.
If you hurt yourself,
it will be my fault again.
See? I told you so.
Give me that drum
and I'll give you a candy.
Let them have it.
I'll get you a new one.
No! Oskar don't want!
We'll see about that.
Alfred, why must you...
always use force?
My drum!
And so I discovered that my voice
was capable of a scream...
so highly pitched...
that no one dared
take my drum away...
Shards bring luck!
because when my drum was
taken away, I screamed...
and when I screamed,
valuable articles burst into bits.
Where's the witch, black as pitch?
Here's the black, wicked witch!
There are going to be changes!
Scum! Beat it!
I'm coming down!
O glorious call of the sun!
I'll take this one.
if you please,
at this extraordinary potato:
this swelling, luxuriant flesh,
forever...
conceiving new shapes...
and yet so chaste.
I love a potato...
because it speaks to me.
The spuds are
bigger this year than last.
What are you doing?
Oskar learn to write.
Stop that.
You'll never learn to write...
and read the great classics,
the eternal truths:
''Die unto life!''
Hold it.
Now I've got all of you.
A bit more to the right, Alex.
For you on your first day of school.
Eyes this way, please.
My name is Spollenhauer,
and I am your teacher.
Be seated.
And now, dear children,
do any of you know a song?
You must be little Oskar.
We've heard so much about you!
How well you play!
Isn't our Oskar a fine drummer?.
But now we'll put the drum away.
It must be sleepy.
After school,
you can have it back again.
You're a naughty Oskar.
I will now read you the program.
Monday: Writing,
Arithmetic, Reading...
Religion.
All together: Writing!
Arith-me-tic!
Oskar, stop that!
Religion.
Get out!
Strange!
Very strange!
How old is he, did you say?
Six, Doctor.
Inge, kindly undress Oskar.
How long is it since
he fell down the stairs?
Three years on September 12.
We'd better examine
the spine again.
Be a good boy.
I'll give it right back.
Oskar, give me your
drum. I'll hold it.
See, you can't get
out of your shirt.
Oskar, if you're not good,
the doctor won't make you well.
Come, child.
Give me your drum!
Amazing! Amazing!
I shall write a paper...
about it for one
of our medical journals...
if you have no objection.
The destructive force
of this local phenomenon...
... is such as to suggest...
an anomalous formation
of the lower larynx...
in little Oskar Matzerath.
Not can we exclude
the hypothesis...
of a concomitant development
of the vocal cords.
Did you hear that?
In a medical journal!
Does the doctor say
why he won't grow?
You'll have to ask him that.
Why he won't grow.
Cut it out!
He's yours as much as mine.
If not more.
Who left the trap open,
you or me?
Uncle Hailandt,
come spit in the soup.
Look what I found in the pond!
Two frogs!
What are you doing,
Tom Thumb?
Make Oskar taste the soup!
Now it's your turn.
You'll love it.
A treat!
Open your mouth!
Good, huh?
Just a little more!
Labesweg and its backyards
hemmed me in.
I longed for space and
took every opportunity...
to escape the persecutions
of the soup cooks...
by going into town...
alone or with Mama.
Drum's busted.
Want me to mend it?
He's getting a new one.
Hello, Uncle Jan.
Coming?
I must leave you now.
A few little errands.
Good-bye, Agnes.
This is for your drum, Oskar.
Who do I see?
Oh, Mrs. Matzerath...
and little Oskar, for a new drum?
Yes, Mr. Markus. Again.
He's always at it.
I never know what year it
is or what day...
except when you come in.
Something tells me
it must be Thursday again.
You have such beautiful hands.
Oskar, see that box?
Hand it to me.
That's it.
See, Mrs. Matzerath.
Beautiful stockings. Silk!
Pure silk. Fine quality!
One, two, three pairs.
Take them.
They'll suit you fine.
A bargain!
Much too dear for me!
- They're worth it.
- Maybe later.
I'll let them go
for half a gulden.
So cheap?
No, Markus, that's
driving them away.
Take them!
Don't ask questions!
And now, Oskar...
what would you like?
Oh! A new drum we need?
Just choose one.
You know where they are!
See, Oskar?.
He's so happy!
Mr. Markus, could
little Oskar stay...
with you for half an hour?.
I have some
important business.
Yes, yes, I'll watch him
like the apple of my eye.
Do your important business
and don't worry.
The little prince
will stay with me...
while you do your
important business...
like every Thursday.
We're blocking the street!
Danzig has always
been German!
If not for the German people...
these eastern regions
would have succumbed...
to total barbarism...
Have a nice walk?
The Fuhrer's speaking all over!
Except here!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the smallest of the small:
Bebra and his midgets!
My word!
Now it's three-year-olds
who choose to stop growing.
My name is Bebra.
Directly descended
from Prince Eugene...
Whose father was Louis XIV...
and not some Savoyard,
as has been claimed.
I stopped my growth
on my tenth birthday.
Better late than never.
Tell me, my dear Oskar.
How old are you?
Fourteen? Fifteen?
Twelve and a half.
No! And how old
do you think I am?
Thirty-five.
Flatterer!
I shall be 53 in August.
I could be your grandfather.
- Are you, too, an artist?
- Not really.
Although...
as you see, I can lay
claim to a certain artistry.
You must join us. You must!
Do you know, Mr. Bebra...
to tell the truth...
I prefer to be a
member of the audience...
and let my little art
flower in secret.
My dear Oskar!
Trust an experienced colleague.
Our kind must never
sit in the audience.
Our kind must perform
and run the show...
or the others will run us.
The others are coming.
They will occupy the fairgrounds.
They will stage torchlight parades,
build rostrums...
fill the rostrums...
and from those rostrums,
preach our destruction.
They're looking for you, dear friend.
We'll meet again.
We're too little to
lose each other.
They are coming!
These damn puttees always slip!
I need boots.
You know they cost way too much.
Or leather gaiters at least.
How do I look?
- Going to the demonstration?
- Yes, at the fairground.
Big show!
Gauleiter Lobsack is speaking.
And what a speaker!
I'm telling you,
these are historic days.
A man can't stand aside.
Gotta join in.
You should read
the Danzig Sentinel.
Crazy your opting for Poland.
I've told you 20 times.
I'm a Pole.
Think it over.
Take your umbrella.
It looks like rain.
An umbrella with my uniform?
The stew is on, Stir it now and then.
Be done in 20 minutes.
Bite to eat before you go?
No time. Duty is duty
and schnaps is schnaps.
National comrades...
of Danzig and Langfuhr...
of Ohra, Schidlitz
and Praust...
from the hills
and from the lowlands...
I know you all...
cherish but one wish.
It has been our heartfelt wish...
ever since a shameful diktat...
separated us...
from our beloved
German fatherland.
That wish is: Home to the Reich!
What is the meaning
of this Free State...
that was so generously
foisted on us?
It means that our waterfront...
is crawling with Polacks.
And in the middle of
our beloved Old City...
they've stuck a
Polish post office--
something we can do without.
We Germans had...
post offices...
before the Poles...
even thought of
writing letters.
We taught them the alphabet.
And now, dear
national comrades...
let us welcome our guest
from the Reich.
Party comrade Albert Forster...
has just arrived on the field.
What's going on?
I want to know what's going on!
Block all the exits!
Can you catch them
with a clothesline?
Real fish or just old shoes?
Suppose we take a look?
Maybe something's there!
The sack!
Call that fat?
You should have seen them...
after the battle of Jutland...
when we and the English--
See what I mean?
After the battle...
they were this thick!
He wanted one-fifty...
but I gave him a gulden.
Don't expect me
to touch your eels!
Don't put on airs.
I'll never eat fist again.
Certainly not eels.
You've always eaten them,
and you knew where they came from.
Quiet!
Stop that drumming!
- Leave the child alone!
- And sit down!
Who was to blame?
Who left the trap open?
Old stuff. Sit down.
See if they're not delicious.
Come on. Dig in.
Fresh eels with dill sauce...
a bay leaf and
a twist of lemon peel.
Don't make her eat
if she doesn't want to.
- keep out of this.
- Leave her alone.
She'll only vomit.
I paid good money for these
eels. Just try them.
They've been well
cleaned and washed.
No gall. Light, healthy liver.
And so fresh!
Oskar! Sit down!
For hours I stand at the stove.
Some people would be very
happy to eat my eels.
I don't know what to do.
Alfred, calm down!
I can't talk to her.
And the fish is getting cold.
Women are more sensitive.
You talk to her. if
only she'd calm down.
Shouldn't I warm
them up at least?
Don't do it with Bronski...
who picked the Polish post office.
Don't bet on the Poles.
If you must bet,
bet on the Germans.
Sooner or later,
they'll take over.
And then you'll be stuck
with Bronski...
that crazy Pole.
You'll be in trouble.
Why not bet on Matzerath?
Or if you'd do me great honor...
bet on me...
on Sigismund Markus...
that was just baptized.
No, Markus. Please!
We could go to London...
like everybody else.
Look. There he is!
We'll take him with us to London.
He'll live like a prince.
Thank you, Markus,
but it's impossible.
And not because of Bronski.
I'm glad to hear that.
Steer clear of Bronski...
and stick to Matzerath!
Come on! Play!
One-two, one-two!
Can't you...
or don't you feel like it, brat?
Cause you can do
everything else.
I have sinned in thought,
in word and in deed.
Alone or with others?
With someone else.
When and where?
Always on Thursday,
in Tischlergasse.
But, child!
Why that low neighborhood?
I can't help it, Father.
I try, but I can't.
But my dear Mrs. Matzerath,
the consequences!
I've got them already, Father.
Father, what will I do
with the child?
I love my little Oskar...
but he's already 14.
Always trouble, and now this!
Pray, Mrs. Matzerath, pray!
Oskar, stop it!
What did I tell you?
Fish again.
She doesn't eat.
She gobbles!
And she's surprised
it doesn't stay down.
Oh, God, how can it be?
Been going on for three weeks.
First it was kippers and sardines.
Now it's pickled herring.
I've tried everything.
I'm at the end of my rope.
Why didn't you call me sooner?.
Agnes. Tell me what's wrong!
You know fish
doesn't agree with you!
Take it from me.
A single communist joining the Party
makes the Fuhrer happier...
than some bourgeois big
shot who only--
Doesn't want to live.
Doesn't want to die.
I don't know.
Too much of everything,
and it piles up.
That's what I used to say.
But I made it.
Think it was easy
when Koljaiczak--
your father--
disappeared under the timber...
and never came back?
But at least he was gone.
How can you talk like that
when you do it with two men...
and never get enough?
That'll do, Mother!
You're pregnant!
So what?
There's plenty of room here.
When will it be?
Never! It'll never be!
But, Agnes!
I had no way of knowing!
Help her!
Why don't you want the child?
It doesn't matter whose it is.
No trumpet playing here!
Go and toot with
your Brown Shirts.
- Nazi swine!
- Red pig!
What are you doing here?
You got no business here!
'Cause you're--
Wanna know what you are?
A kike.
That's what you are.
See what they're
doing to Markus...
that was baptized
only the other day?
Is your drum broken?
Come see me.
You'll get a new drum.
Beautiful day!
She's gone to the place
where everything is so cheap.
Yes, a beautiful day.
An unforgettable day.
I, too, have seen the Lord.
You've seen the Lord?
A beautiful day!
The Lord has passed.
He was in a hurry.
There once was a drummer.
His name was Oskar.
He lost his poor mama,
who had eaten too much fish.
There was once
a credulous people...
who believed in Santa Claus.
But Santa Claus was
really the gas man!
There was once a toy merchant.
His name was
Sigismund Markus...
and he sold tin drums
lacquered red and white.
There was once a drummer.
His name was Oskar.
There was once a toy merchant...
whose name was Markus...
and he took all the toys in the
world away with him.
September 1, 1939.
You know the data, I assume.
That was when I committed
my second crime.
For I, Oskar the drummer...
not only drummed my poor
mama to her grave.
I also dragged...
my poor uncle and presumptuous
father, Jan Bronski...
to the Polish post office...
so causing his death.
- Halt! You can't go through.
- Why not? I work here.
Off limits. Nobody's allowed in.
We only want to see Kobyella.
He's a Pole! Stop him!
It's high time.
Quick! They're issuing weapons.
You're always the last one.
Helmet.
The ammunition's over there.
What are you doing here?
Kobyella. Repair drum.
Impossible. Kobyella
has no time for you now.
Bronski, are you crazy?
Get that boy out of the way.
Go and hide somewhere, Oskar.
I have to stay here.
Go on. Hurry!
On September first...
the territory of Germany
was violated.
Last night, for the first time...
Poles opened fire
on German regulars...
on German soil.
Since 5:45 this morning,
their fire is being returned.
From now on, bomb
will be answered by bomb.
The drum! Jan! The drum!
Oskar! Come down!
The drum!
Oskar! Take cover.
You can't stay here, Oskar.
Take cover! Fire!
Hey, Kobyella. Don't give up.
I'll tie you
Then you won't tip over.
Is it my turn?
With one play, two contras,
three schneiders, four times clubs.
That makes 48 or 12 pfennigs.
Hey, don't be a spoilsport.
I can't play by myself.
Pull yourself together.
what's wrong?
Kobyella, I beg you.
I've got a Grand Hand.
A Grand Hand.
Agnes!
She's dead.
We surrender. Don't shoot!
Hands up! Quicker!
They filmed us for a newsreel
that was shown...
in all the movie houses...
because Oskar's experience
in the Polish post office...
went down in history...
as the first battle
of World War II.
What? They've
shot Jan Bronski?
All the Polish
clerks were shot.
Then the Germans picked
up the cartridge cases.
All but one.
They always forget one.
The Hanseatic
Free City of Danzig...
celebrated the union
of its brick Gothic...
with the Greater German Reich.
It's a big moment in your life.
Keep your eyes open.
You'll have stories to tell.
I think I'll faint
if he looks at me!
There he comes.
This is Maria.
She wants to work for you.
You said you
needed somebody...
for the customers...
and for Oskar here.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with you.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us poor sinners...
now and in the hour of our death.
Lord, give us--
Faith.
And make me go to heaven.
Have you gone to the toilet?
Another tune?
"Mary, My Adoration. "
Maria, I love you
With all of my heart
Forever and ever
We never will part
Go away!
Disregarding my
anonymous infatuations...
Maria was my first love.
How old are you?
Just sixteen.
Me too.
I can't believe it.
Maria smelled of vanilla.
I wondered why.
Did she rub herself
with some root?
Was it some cheap perfume...
that she sprayed herself with?
Oskar resolved to find out.
What are you doing?
Hey, stop it!
You little rascal!
You dive in, and
you don't know a thing.
Good evening.
- Gonna be late?
- Could be.
Too many victories to celebrate.
You can sleep with Maria.
There's plenty of room in
my bed for Oskar.
He's just a shrimp.
Quick! Into the hay!
Come up here!
Look. He's so happy.
Good night.
It's a quarter to.
A little more. Just a little.
But be careful.
Don't worry.
Almost. Almost.
Just a little more.
But be careful!
I am!
Go away!
Hey!
Alfred, stop it!
Is it the kid's fault
if you're not careful?
Me? Who kept
wanting a little more?
I said, ''Be careful. It's coming soon. ''
But it never came at all.
Never enough.
You're all the same.
In, out, finished.
That's your idea of love.
Well, go look
for somebody else.
Do you take me
for an electric bell?
And you never
take precautions!
Stop bawling. I'm fed up.
Then go back to your
comrades, you jerk.
I need a change,
that's for sure.
Women!
They're all a lot of quick
squirters. Beat it!
Get yourself a POW
if you're in heat.
Maybe the Frog
that brings the beer.
Maybe he'll satisfy you.
I see love as something
more than piggishness
Next time I'll play cards.
Then I'll know what to expect.
You nasty little dwarf!
You crazy midget!
You belong in the bughouse!
Oh, Oskar, I didn't mean it.
Then you'll have you own room.
He'll soon be 17.
Come on in.
You'll freeze.
Want to come in a while?
Come a little closer, Oskar.
Come under the covers,
where it's warm.
It's dreadfully cold.
Greff doesn't
give us enough heat.
Come in.
Go ahead.
Greff wants to harden his body.
He loves youth, hard bodies...
but he likes boys
more than girls.
Victory through strength
and through joy
My feet are frozen.
A scout is never cold.
They're doing fine in the east.
Leningrad will fall any day.
Kiev's more important
because of the oil.
More zip than in '15
when I was in the army.
Moscow's the main thing.
Alfred, you carve.
What would we
do without Grandma?
Yes, the Kashubians are
still good for something.
Oh, if I could
only be out there!
But I'm needed
on the home front.
Moscow must be wiped out...
or we'll have to feed
all those people.
The Fuhrer knows that.
They've sent my Herbert
to the front...
to make him fight.
Disciplinary battalion.
Starve 'em!
Starve all our enemies!
That'll end the war.
Breast or drumstick?
I'd like a drumstick.
It's nice and juicy.
The nations of Europe
are all on our side.
The stalwart Finns.
No goose without sage!
- The Magyars, the Rumanians.
- Oh, Oskar, what a splendid feast.
We're advancing
on the oceans too.
For we're sailing
No goose, Greff?
You know I don't eat meat.
A youthful nation rises
ready for the storm
Raise the banner higher
This isn't a Kashubian goose anymore.
It's a German goose.
Anyway it's delicious.
Now you've got
a little brother, Oskar.
You'll soon be
able to play with him.
The butcher's son has been killed.
He got the Iron Cross, First Class.
Second Class!
When I say First, it's First!
Anyway he's dead.
Kurt, my son--
You are definitely my son.
When you're three...
I'll give you a drum...
and if you want to stop growing...
I'll show you how it's done.
An autograph, please.
My dear Oskar!
How glad I am to see you again!
Didn't I tell you?
We're too little to lose each other.
Splendid! Splendid!
You haven't grown an inch.
Permit me to introduce Oskar...
an old friend,
who sings glass to bits.
Signorina Roswitha Raguna...
the great somnambulist!
The joy of our soldiers
on every front...
and of my old age.
You're surprised to see
me in this uniform...
but the Propaganda Ministry
approached us...
asked us to appear
before the country's top leaders.
Filthy politics!
And now we
entertain the troops.
A present from Oskar.
You are very talented.
Why don't you join us?
What's to keep you here?
Yes, join us, young man.
Play your drum, sing champagne
glasses and light bulbs to bits.
The German army of occupation
in fair France, in gay Paris...
will thank you.
Dear tin soldiers of Paris...
Bebra's Front Line Theater
will play for you...
sing for you...
and help you to win the war!
What are you thinking about?
About my grandmother's skirts.
And now, ladies
and gentlemen...
for the first time in France...
a newcomer to our program...
the man with
the secret weapon...
who have heard so much about:
Oskar the drummer!
Oskar the glass killer!
Mazeltov.
One corporal, five men,
nothing to report.
Thank you. At ease, Corporal.
You see? Nothing to report.
Been this way for years.
There's always the tide,
nature's contribution.
That's what keeps our men busy.
That's why we go on
building pollboxes.
You have faith in concrete?
We haven't much
faith in anything.
- Am I right, Corporal?
- Right, sir.
But still you mix and pour.
Is the black witch here today
No, no, no
She will make an evil brew
She will put you in her stew
and then she will devour you
Is the black witch here today
Yes, yes, yes
Look
There she is
Goody! Picnic in the open.
Real Hungarian
salami. Wonderful!
Chocolate from Holland!
And now, fall to!
Dig in, my friends!
Where do we begin?
Ah! With caviar!
Rescued from Stalingrad!
And now, Signorina Raguna...
could you tell us...
as well as the ladies and gentlemen
present tonight...
the exact birth date...
of Lieutenant Herzog?
April 11...
1915...
in Bremen.
That's right. So is the place.
Applause...
for Signorina Raguna,
the great somnambulist.
I see they're bringing
him champagne.
- But you'll never drink it.
- Comrades.
- I'm sorry.
- Why not?
All together!
Where's the witch
black as pitch
Don't be afraid.
Nothing will happen.
My little man!
Children! Quick!
What's the matter?.
The Americans are coming!
Oskar, I must have coffee!
- I can't go without coffee.
- Roswitha, we're leaving.
Please, a cup of coffee!
Roswitha, I don't know
how old you were.
I only know that you
smelled of cinnamon...
and nutmeg.
You could see
into the hearts of men...
but not into your own heart.
Ah, dear Oskar...
we dwarfs and fools
shouldn't dance on concrete...
that was poured for giants.
Come on.
We have to move out.
- Well, Oskar, good-bye.
- Good luck.
And keep your chin up.
Hey, Kurt, Oskar's come back
for your birthday.
Your little brother is just three.
I've brought you a present.
Are you allowed to wear that uniform?
Where have you been?
We looked all over for you.
The police looked high and low.
We had to swear
we hadn't bumped you off.
Well, now you're here.
Beethoven. Now
there was a genius!
Attention! Attention!
This is the first Berlin
Antiaircraft Division.
The reported bomber formations...
and now in the Hanover area.
Turn it off. It's all over.
Final victory!
Alfred, get rid of your Party pin!
The Russkis'll
be here any minute!
Bury it under the potatoes.
Hands up!
All right, I'll do it.
Hurry! I've still got
shoes to sole.
Oh, my! His hand!
It doesn't hurt him now.
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghost.
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Kurt!
Stop throwing stones.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Should I or shouldn't I?
You're 20, Oskar!
Should you or shouldn't you?
You're an orphan, Oskar!
I should, I must...
I will grow!
Kurt, now what
have you done?
He's growing!
Look! see how he's growing!
I have seen the Lord!
The Lord! The Lord!
See how he's growing!
The Lord!
Just like a Kashubian!
Our heads were
made for hard knocks.
And now you're going
where things are better.
Only Grandma will stay here...
because you can't move
Kashubians around like that.
They have to stay
so other people...
can clout them on the head...
because we're
not Polish enough...
and not German enough...
and they want everything
just right!
Does it hurt?
I hope it's not
water on the brain.
When he was three,
he fell down the stairs...
and stopped growing.
Now he's fallen into a grave
and wants to grow again.
