[distant dialogue from TV]
[TV] Poor, poor, Dan O'Reilly.
Sit, sir. Drink with me.
Hello.
[TV] One more crack about
the Irish, Mr. Lamb…
- and I'll shoot you.
- Excuse me?
[TV] Am I clear?
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.
I'm supposed to meet a man here.
[TV] Let us drink then
to the Irish.
Have you seen anyone?
[TV] No finer race of men
have ever peeled a potato.
- Do you pray, Mr. Lamb?
- Good lord, son. No, I do not.
I'm to meet a man here
to take me to the compound.
[TV] Let us change our toast,
sir.
To the God who has forgotten us.
But first, cardinal rule…
Do you have a bathroom?
[speaks foreign language]
[TV] Perhaps you've read
On the Origin of the Species

Don't waste water.
[vehicle approaches]
[engine rumbles]
$100 for the gas,
$20 for the water.
I'll add that to the $200
you owe me for the ride.
I thought gas was included
in the $200?
Is that a problem?
Because I can turn back?
No, no problem, I'm…
I thought it was $200,
that's all.
Well, I figured the company
would have given you
the details.
[Virgil] They said that there
was a man driving out this way
and that it was $200
to get a ride.
Well, they should have told you
that gas and whatnot is extra.
It's fine.

[Keith] Came from the west,
right?
[Virgil] Thereabouts, yeah.
I hear it's getting pretty bad
out that way now.
It's not good.
Folks turning on each other?
Yeah.
Seeing that mass exodus
down south there,
that ain't gonna end well.
I don't follow it that close.
Yeah, pretty soon
there'll be hordes of people
coming out this way.
What happened to your face?
What happened?
Yeah.
Nothing happened.
You got that big old scar
on there,
look like someone
might have jumped you.
Does it matter?
Not to me, no, I'm just making
conversation is all.
No-one back west
worth staying for, huh?
No.
You?
Nah, not me, no.
I got used to being alone
a long time ago.
Yeah, me too.
So, why the compound?
Seems a strange place
to be heading.
You're going there.
Yeah, but I mean,
I'm in and out, so…
Opportunity.
[paper rustles]
Once in a lifetime opportunity.
Let me look at that.
Go on, let me have a look.
Please.
Wow!
In just four months
you'll be a changed man, huh?
[Keith laughs]
[Keith] I'd take what they say
with a grain of salt, you know?
I mean, I don't mean to
rain on your parade or nothing,
but those places
and the people who run them,
they just talk it up to get
the likes of you out here.
The likes of me?
Where I'm from ain't no picnic
neither.
Well, I daresay whatever you've
come from ain't very pretty,
but where you're heading
certainly ain't any better.
I'll tell you that much
for free.
It's hard labour.
Shitty hours, real dirty work.
I'm not afraid of hard work.
Yeah, well, it ain't just
the hard work.
It's the whole damn place.
People there have got that look
in their eye.
And there's you coming in
with your little puppy dog eyes
and your quiet nature,
and you're gonna have
a right time of it,
you're gonna be a target.
I can handle it.
I'm sure you can.

If it burns black,
it ain't gold.
[flame crackles]
[lighter snaps]
That's fucking gold.
[grunts]
[dogs howl in distance]
Alright.
Come over here.
Let's go.
Alright, help me here, again.
Wiggle out this thing.
OK.
Ready?
One…
Two… Three…
[grunts]
[heavy breathing]
How do we do this?
Ah…
[heavy breathing]
I don't know.
We're getting the fucking thing
out.
[engine rumbles]
[grunts]
OK.
[engine accelerates]
Rope it again.
[heavy breathing]
OK.

[coughs]
[grunts]
[Keith] Well, better get us
some firewood before sundown.
Keep those damn dogs away.
[Virgil] What dogs?
They got their eye on us now,
but with a good fire burning…
..they won't bother us.
Come on.
[wind rustles]
[dogs bark and howl
in the distance]
[insects chirp]
[dog howls in the distance]
[flames crackle]
Well, I guess I ain't taking
you to the compound no more?
You gonna head back west now?
I guess not.
[Keith] Yeah. Never much worth
in what we leave behind.
[laughs]
Goddammit!
You just found a fuckin' pile
of gold.
[cackles]
Yee-hah!
We just found
a fucking pile of gold!
We just found a fucking pile
of gold! Come on, man!
Get up! When does this ever
fuckin' happen?
Yee-hahahaha!
What are the odds, man?
What are the odds?
[laughs]
Woo!
Oh!
[moody orchestral music]
[flames crackle]
Well, one of us will have to get
the excavator to get it out.
Why one of us?
One of us will have to stay here
with the gold, obviously.
Protect it.
Of course, yeah.
I know a place
a couple of days drive east
that'll have what we need.
Two days there, two days back,
one sorting an excavator.
Five days?
Well, maybe four,
but you'll have to keep stopping
to cool down the engine.
You'll have to be careful
asking around.
People get wind of you
needing an excavator,
they're likely to want to know
why.
I'll give you the name
of someone I trust
and I'll stay here
with the gold.
Why don't I stay here
with the gold?
You know where to get
the excavator.
[dog howls]
I'm gonna say something here,
and uh, I don't want you to take
it the wrong way or nothing,
but I don't trust you to keep
your head while I'm gone.
I don't mean to talk down to you
or nothing, but,
you gotta watch your water.
How much you drink,
how much you got left.
You gotta stay out of the sun.
Watch your food. If you run out,
you gotta catch more.
It ain't no fucking joke
out here.
You're a bit loose with it all,
not being from here, you know?
I think I can handle it.
Well, like I said, I don't mean
to condescend you or nothing,
but,
you may feel pretty safe with me
here right now, but,
once I'm gone with the truck
and you're here
all by your lonesome,
be a very different feeling
indeed.
You're likely to panic.
Do something stupid.
And then what?
There's fuck all people
coming through here,
but if someone does,
they're not likely to want us
to keep the gold for ourselves,
if you know what I mean?
And I just don't think
you have it in you
to stop that from happening.
And I do not want to risk
what we got here.
No offence.
I think I'll stay with the gold.
You sure?
I'm sure.
[pensive music]
I got more water
'cause I've gotta put it in the
truck to keep the engine cool.
It is what it is.
It is what it is.
You got a few cans
of food there,
but if run out,
you might want this.
You see something,
don't be afraid, you use it.
[strains]
Now, keep this sat phone on you.
Spare batteries.
And I'll try and call you from
a payphone on the way there.
But I'm going to try and buy one
when I get to the excavator.
Then I can call you on the way
back without stopping.
- [Car door slams]
- OK.
It'll be OK.
You just do what I said and…
keep your head on.
Just think, by the time I get
back, we'll be rich as all hell.

Hey.
[Keith on the phone] Got some
bad news, I'm afraid.
I'm at the weigh station,
and the engine's overheated.
[scoffs] Shit!
[Keith]
I'm moving as fast as I can,
but this could take longer.
I broke off a chunk of the gold.
It's a decent size.
[Keith] Chunk?
Don't even think about it.
You had something like this
landed in your lap before?
No.
- Want to risk losing it?
- No.
Stay with the gold.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
We'll have more
than just a chunk.
We'll have it all.
OK.

Are you scavenging?
- Yep.
- To take where?
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere?
Right.
Dried snake?
- No.
- Go On. They won't bite.
I said no.
Sláinte.
[drinks noisily]
[sighs with content]
[stranger] So you're out here on
your own?
I was.
Why here?
It's as good as place as any.
Well, that's a load of bollocks,
'cause about 5km that way,
there's actually a waterhole.
[stranger] More shelter.
I like it just fine here.
Then where are you taking that?
Nervous little fucker,
aren't you?
[pensive music]
Wait. Wait!
I see you got another camp
that way over there.
[Virgil] Stop. Stop.
Listen. I'm burning waste,
that's all.
[stranger] OK, I can see the
smoke.
You…you shouldn't shit
in your own backyard.
[stranger] Oh, oh, that…that's
smart.
Nothin' worse than
the smell of shite in the sun.
Wait.
[stranger] Tell me, will you
mind
if I commandeer your little
shite fire over there?
Just take the plane.
It's the best shelter.
You can build a fire.
I'll leave you to it.
[stranger] You running from
something?
No.
You hiding from the law?
No.
Well, I bet you're
from the north.
How'd you say you got here?
I didn't.
Where are you going?
To the compound.
And how are you getting there?
- A friend.
- Friend?
So where is this friend?
Passing through
and picking me up on the way.
But how did you get here, then?
Hm?
I'm a little deaf in this ear,
you'll have to speak up.
Listen, lady.
My friend is coming through,
and he's picking me up on the
way, that's it.
There's nothing more to it.
OK? Fuck off.
I offered you shelter. Take it.
I think you're lying.
Got a headache, huh? Have you?
The brain gets dehydrated
out here.
Sooner or later, it'll be
nothing but a dried up sponge
bouncing around in your skull.
Things start to get real
strange then.
Hallucinations, even.
You should rest, you should take
your shoes off.
Take it easy, breathe.
That's it.
Just rest.
[ominous music]
Hey.
Hey. Hey!
Wait!
[grunts]
Hey!
[stranger] Nice little camp you
got here.
You didn't want to share, huh?
[maniacal chuckle]
Pitched yourself a 5-star hotel,
have ya?
And look at this fuckin' knot.
Get the fuck outta here!
Leave it!
So, how did you get here,
anyway, hm?
Did you walk?
Camel?
Magic carpet, maybe?
You need to leave.
Well, I think
you're hidin' somethin'.
You're a lyin' little swine.
I think you came through here
with someone,
and hatched a wee plan.
A bunch of greedy little pigs.
You think you can come out here
'cause your fucked-up city
turned on itself,
and take what isn't yours?
No, you people are a virus
and you want me to leave.

you, city boy!

You with the gold?
Where are you?
Nearly here?
I got the excavator now
...the goddamn thing's
slowing me down.
You there?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
OK, listen.
I can make up some time,
but it still may take longer
than I planned.
You there?
Yeah, I'm here.
I got a phone now
that you can call me on.
Call me on this number
if you need anything.
Stay strong.
Listen, like I said, just keep
your head on. You'll be fine.
I'm goin' as fast as I can.
You OK?
How long until…?
How much longer…?
How long until you fix the hose?
What hose?
The hose.
I fixed it before I left.
You sure you're OK?
Can you hear me?
How's your water?
You have enough to eat?

Hello.
- Hello.
- [Keith] Hey, can you hear me?
I can't see her.
I can't see her.
What are you talking about?
Who else is there?
She's all over the place.
Is someone else there?
Who is she?
Does she know about the gold?
[demandingly]
Has she seen the gold?
No.
You gotta get rid of her, OK?
OK?
- Yeah, yeah.
- OK, good.
Do whatever you gotta do.
You understand?
You there? Can you hear me?
Fuckin' get rid of her!
You there?
Can you hear me?
OK.
OK.
[stranger 2] You hungry?
[flies buzzing]
You're not hungry?
No.
Let me fix you some food.
Did you not hear me?
I said no.
Listen, there's a waterhole.
I can walk you there.
Go.
You'll die if you don't.
Go!
So, you didn't see my sister?
[dramatic music]
Go.
[growling and sniffing]
[vultures cawing]
[ominous music]
[phone beeping, ringing]
- [Keith] Did you get rid of her?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Where are you?
- I'm close.
- How close?
- I can see smoke.
Is that you?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. That's me.
[dog growling]
Get the fuck outta here!
[dogs barking and growling]
You need to hurry.
You need to hurry.
[growling]
Get the fuck outta here!
[incessant barking]
Get off!
I said get the fuck outta here!
[guttural yell]
[in the distance] Fuck off!
[yelling in distance]
[yelling, dogs barking]
[Virgil on the phone] Where are
you?
Hello?
Can you see the smoke?
Can you hear me?
Hello.

Where are you?
I did my part,
I protected it!

I found it! It's mine!
