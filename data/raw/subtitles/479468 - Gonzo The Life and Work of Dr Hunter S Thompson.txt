( peeping )
( faint TV sportscaster
speaking )
...handoff
on the left side.
...first down, Hunter's
out at the 20-yard line
and a big...
Sondi Wright:
HE'D KNOWN FOR
A LONG TIME
THAT HE WAS NO LONGER
A REALLY GOOD WRITER.
HE HAD SPURTS.
Douglas Brinkley:
HE LOST THAT GONZO EDGE.
( TV sports announcer
resumes )
Tom Wolfe:
I WONDER WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO OLD HUNTER.
HE'S KIND OF LOSING IT.
Charles Perry:
CREATIVELY, HE HAD WRITTEN
ALL HIS GREAT STUFF.
HE HADN'T
BEEN REALLY PRODUCTIVE
FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS.
I THINK HE JUST HAD
RUN OUT OF JUICE.
Brinkley:
IN HUNTER'S LAST YEARS--
IN ORDER TO REALLY GET
THE JUICES STIRRED UP
IN HIM--
IN WHAT WE CALL
QUINTESSENTIAL HUNTER--
IT TOOK SOMETHING LIKE--
IT HAD TO ALMOST A FEEL
LIKE A KICK IN THE GROIN.
Johnny Depp:
"IT WAS JUST AFTER DAWN
IN WOODY CREEK, COLORADO,
WHEN THE FIRST PLANE HIT
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
IN NEW YORK CITY
ON TUESDAY MORNING.
AND AS USUAL I WAS
WRITING ABOUT SPORTS,
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
FOOTBALL SUDDENLY
SEEMED IRRELEVANT
COMPARED TO
THE SCENES OF DESTRUCTION
AND UTTER DEVASTATION
COMING OUT
OF NEW YORK ON TV."
( "All Along the Watchtower"
playing )
"THE TOWERS ARE GONE NOW,
REDUCED TO BLOODY RUBBLE,
ALONG WITH ALL HOPES
FOR PEACE IN OUR TIME--
IN THE UNITED STATES
OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY."
( rock music continues )
"MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT:
WE ARE AT WAR NOW."
* "THERE MUST BE
SOME WAY OUT OF HERE" *
* SAID THE JOKER
TO THE THIEF... *
Depp:
"IT WILL BE A RELIGIOUS WAR--
A SORT OF CHRISTIAN JIHAD
FUELED BY RELIGIOUS HATRED
AND LED BY MERCILESS
FANATICS ON BOTH SIDES--
GUERRILLA WARFARE
ON A GLOBAL SCALE
WITH NO FRONT LINES
AND NO IDENTIFIABLE ENEMY."
* ALL ALONG
THE WATCHTOWER *
* PRINCES KEPT THE VIEW
* WHILE ALL THE WOMEN
CAME AND WENT... *
Depp:
"WE'RE GONNA PUNISH
SOMEBODY FOR THIS ATTACK,
BUT JUST WHO OR WHAT
WILL BE BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS
IS HARD TO SAY--
MAYBE AFGHANISTAN,
MAYBE PAKISTAN OR IRAQ."
* TWO RIDERS
WERE APPROACHING *
* THE WIND BEGAN
TO HOWL. *
"THIS IS GOING TO BE
A VERY EXPENSIVE WAR,
AND VICTORY IS NOT
GUARANTEED FOR ANYONE--
AND CERTAINLY NOT
FOR ANYONE AS BAFFLED
AS GEORGE W BUSH.
HE WILL DECLARE
A NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY
AND CLAMP DOWN HARD
ON EVERYBODY, NO MATTER
WHERE THEY LIVE OR WHY.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
ONCE SAID,
'THE FIRST CASUALTY OF WAR
IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH.'
THE LID IS ON.
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
THAT MIGHT GIVE AID
TO THE ENEMY."
TV anchor:
A giant of the written
word has died.
Hunter S Thompson
was a lot of things--
a journalist,
an author, a patriot,
a professional
troublemaker,
a complex
walking monument
to misbehavior
who apparently
took his own life
with a gun last night.
Depp:
"IT WAS ALWAYS AT NIGHT,
LIKE A WEREWOLF,
THAT I WOULD
TAKE THE THING OUT
FOR AN HONEST RUN
DOWN THE COAST.
I WOULD START
IN GOLDEN GATE PARK,
THINKING ONLY
TO RUN A FEW LONG CURVES
TO CLEAR MY HEAD."
( rock music playing )
"THE MOMENTARY FREEDOM
OF THE PARK WAS LIKE
THE ONE UNLUCKY DRINK
THAT SHOVES A WAVERING
ALCOHOLIC OFF THE WAGON.
BUT IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,
I'D BE OUT AT THE BEACH
WITH THE SOUND
OF THE ENGINE IN MY EARS,
THE SURF BOOMING UP
ON THE SEA WALL
AND A FINE EMPTY ROAD
STRETCHING ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO SANTA CRUZ.
THERE WAS NO HELMET
ON THOSE NIGHTS,
NO SPEED LIMIT
AND NO COOLING IT DOWN
AROUND THE CURVES.
THEN INTO SECOND GEAR,
FORGETTING THE CARS
AND LETTING THE BEAST
WIND OUT-- 35, 45.
THEN INTO THIRD,
NOT WORRIED ABOUT GREEN
OR RED SIGNALS
BUT ONLY SOME OTHER
WEREWOLF LOONY.
NOW THERE IS NO SOUND
EXCEPT WIND.
THE NEEDLE
LEANS DOWN ON 100,
AND WIND-BURNED EYEBALLS
STRAIN TO SEE DOWN
THE CENTERLINE--
NO ROOM AT ALL
FOR MISTAKES.
THAT'S WHEN
THE STRANGE MUSIC STARTS."
* IN THE NIGHT
* THOUGH WE'RE APART... *
Depp:
"THE EDGE-- THERE IS
NO HONEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT
BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO REALLY KNOW WHERE IT IS
ARE THE ONES
WHO HAVE GONE OVER.
THE OTHERS--
THE LIVING--
ARE THOSE WHO PUSHED THEIR
CONTROL AS FAR AS THEY FELT
THEY COULD HANDLE IT,
AND THEN PULLED BACK,
OR SLOWED DOWN.
BUT THE EDGE...
IS STILL OUT THERE."
Man:
What is your name,
please?
My name is
Hunter Thompson.
My name is
Hunter Thompson.
- My name is Hunter Thompson.
- ( rock music playing )
Sonny Barger:
I MET HUNTER IN THE '60s
A SHORT TIME BEFORE
HE WROTE THE BOOK ON US.
AND HE WENT ON TO BECOME
PROBABLY ONE
OF THE GREATEST WRITERS
THAT AMERICA WILL EVER HAVE.
DOESN'T MEAN HE ISN'T
A JERK IN MY EYES,
BUT HE'S
A VERY GOOD WRITER.
Wolfe:
HUNTER REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF MARK TWAIN.
HE WAS A REPORTER-- TWAIN
STARTED OUT AS A REPORTER--
WITH A WILD IMAGINATION
AND HE'S NOT
TRYING TO FOOL YOU.
YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT
HE IS FILTERING REALITY
THROUGH WHAT HUNTER
CALLED GONZO.
Man:
Will the real Hunter
Thompson please stand up?
Wright:
WILL THE REAL HUNTER
THOMPSON STAND UP?
- ( laughing )
- ( applause )
THAT WAS BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT ALL THAT WAS GOING TO MEAN.
( sniffs, mumbles )
OOPS, ARE WE MARKING?
OH, NO! GOD!
HELP US, JESUS!
I KNOW IT.
IT'S IN MY INTEREST--
MAYBE IN THE INTEREST
OF GREATEST GOOD--
FOR ME TO SMOKE
A JOINT AND CALM DOWN.
Jimmy Carter:
HE WAS NOT AFRAID
TO ROCK THE BOAT,
TO CHALLENGE
THE ESTABLISHMENT
AND EXPRESS HIMSELF
IN UNIQUE AND RADICAL,
SOMETIMES SHOCKING, WAYS.
Pat Buchanan:
HE DESCRIBED ME AS
A HALF-CRAZED DAVY CROCKETT
RUNNING AROUND THE PARAPETS
OF NIXON'S ALAMO.
WE WERE ALL AMUSED
BY HIM.
HE WAS AN INTERESTING GUY
TO BE AROUND.
HE ASKED YOU
UNEXPECTED QUESTIONS.
MOST PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED
THAT I WALK ON TWO LEGS.
I THINK PEOPLE THINK
I'M... VERY MUCH--
MAYBE A VIOLENT VERSION
OF THAT COMIC STRIP.
THIS IS THE LAST DRAWING
I DID OF HIM SO FAR.
"MY GOD! I MUSTA MISSED--
IT'S HELL DOWN HERE!!"
( chuckles )
Ralph Steadman:
HE'S PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES
AS MUCH AS HE COULD.
LIFE TO HIM WAS
THE CHALLENGE.
HE WAS GONNA BE DEAD
AT 30, ANYWAY,
SO NOW HE WAS LIVING
ON BORROWED TIME.
( Hunter over phone )
"DEAR HUNTER,
IT IS OVER A YEAR
SINCE YOU SET THE SCENE
FOR YOUR STRANGELY-
PLANNED SUICIDE.
THE MESSAGES THAT I HAVE
RECEIVED FROM YOU
UP TO THE BUSH/KERRY
ELECTION OF 2004
WERE INFECTED
BY A DISMAL UNDERTONE.
'IF BUSH WINS,' YOU SAID,
'THE PLANET IS DOOMED.'
WHEN YOU PULLED
THE TRIGGER ON YOUR MAGNUM .44,
MY FIRST
REACTION WAS TO SAY,
'ABOUT BLOODY TIME.
HE'S BEEN THREATENING
TO DO THAT FOR YEARS.'
YOU WERE
NEVER REASONABLE,
AND YOU KNEW,
IN SPITE
OF YOUR WAYWARD SPIRIT,
YOU WERE NOT INVINCIBLE.
THOSE WHO
GREW TO BE A THREAT
TO YOUR AMERICA
CONTINUE TO BURGEON.
FOR YOU, IT WAS
VICTORY OR GAME OVER.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO HANG
AROUND AND NAIL THE BEAUTY
OF THAT IMAGE
OF ABSOLUTE EVIL.
BUT YOU LEAVE US
WITH A BLUEPRINT,
OLD SPORT.
TAKE IT UP
WITH THE GODS.
SEND WORD.
RALPH."
Wright:
I THINK HE WAS IMPORTANT
IN A LITERARY WAY
AND ALSO
IN A POLITICAL WAY.
AND I THINK THAT
HIS STORY IS TRAGIC.
HE WAS LOVING.
HE WAS GENEROUS.
ON THE OTHER END
OF THE SPECTRUM,
THE BOY IN THE MAN
WAS ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS.
GOD DAMN, YOU DUMBASS!
REACH UNDER THERE
- AND GET SOME
GODDAMNED MEDICINE!
- Man: OVER HERE?
TO THE RIGHT.
Anita Thompson:
HUNTER HAD TWO EXTREMES
IN HIM
THAT HE LIVED WITH
CONSTANTLY--
THE GENEROUS,
BEAUTIFUL HUNTER
AND THE SCARY,
MEAN, CRUEL HUNTER.
AND HE WAS AWARE
OF BOTH.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS
IN CONTROL OF BOTH
ALL THE TIME,
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY
AWARE OF BOTH.
AND THEY BECAME
PRESENT IN HIS LIFE
WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG--
BOTH SIDES.
( jazz music playing )
Brinkley:
YOU'VE GOTTA GO BACK
TO LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
TO UNDERSTAND HIM.
HIS FATHER DIED WHEN
HE WAS YOUNG.
SO YOU HAD A MOTHER
RAISING THREE BOYS
ON A LIBRARIAN SALARY.
HE LIVED-- IT WASN'T
EVEN MIDDLE CLASS,
IT WAS A LOWER-
MIDDLE-CLASS EXISTENCE.
HIS FRIENDS WERE THE RICH
KIDS OF LOUISVILLE,
THE ONES THAT
HAD ALL THE PRIVILEGE.
SO HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE RAILROAD TRACKS.
YET, HUNTER WAS VERY SMART,
NATURALLY INTELLIGENT,
AND HE ALWAYS FELT
A BIT LIKE THE OUTSIDER.
HE WAS A REAL HELLION
ON VANDALISM.
THE SEMINAL EXPERIENCE
WAS WHEN HE AND A GROUP
OF BUDDIES
WERE PARTYING
AND SMOKING CIGARETTES
AND DRINKING BEER.
THEY WERE ALL ARRESTED.
THE RICH KIDS WHO KNEW
THE JUDGES GOT OUT.
HUNTER NEVER GOT TO WALK
FOR GRADUATION.
HE WAS IN JAIL.
Depp:
"I COULD SEE THE MOON
HUNG HIGH IN THE SKY
WITH A MOCKING GRIN
ON HIS FACE.
I SEIZED THE BARS,
AND SHRIEKED AND WAILED
LIKE A SOUL
WHO'S LOST IN HELL."
Wright:
ESSENTIALLY, INSIDE...
HUNTER WAS AN AGONIZED
HUMAN BEING.
BUT HE ALSO FELT
LIKE HE HAD
THE POTENTIAL
OF BEING
A REALLY GREAT WRITER.
Brinkley:
"THE GREAT GATSBY" IS HOW
HUNTER LEARNED TO WRITE.
HE WOULD TYPE
"THE GREAT GATSBY"
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
JUST TO LEARN
THE MUSIC OF FITZGERALD.
"THE GREAT GATSBY"
WAS FILLED WITH ANGER
THAT THE WHOLE DEAL
IN AMERICAN LIFE WAS RIGGED.
HUNTER IDENTIFIED
WITH FITZGERALD I'D SAY
MORE THAN ANY OTHER WRITER.
THE DIFFERENCE IS
FITZGERALD WOULD LOOK IN
ON THE CANDY STORE WINDOW,
LOOK IN ON THE STOREFRONTS
OF THE RICH.
HUNTER WANTED
TO SMASH THE WINDOWS.
Wright:
HUNTER WAS EXTREMELY
SEDUCTIVE.
I WAS VERY ATTRACTED
TO HUNTER.
HIS ENERGY
WAS JUST PHENOMENAL.
HE WROTE EVERY DAY.
HE WAS GETTING PAID
$100 FOR AN ARTICLE
OR SOMETHING,
BUT WE WERE VERY POOR.
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
WITH MY SON,
HUNTER SHOT ELK
AND I ATE ELK LIVER,
MILK AND SALAD, PERIOD.
THAT'S ALL I ATE.
Brinkley:
HERE WAS A GUY
STRUGGLING.
HE HAD HIS WIFE SONDI
WITH HIM.
HE WAS LIVING
ON A FREELANCER,
CHECK TO CHECK,
BARELY ABLE TO PAY RENT.
SO WHEN HE GOT
THE ASSIGNMENT
FROM CAREY MCWILLIAMS
OF "THE NATION"
TO WRITE ABOUT THIS
PHENOMENON-- HELL'S ANGELS--
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
Man:
"I, Hunter Thompson,
am a writer.
Recently, I spent
over a year living
in close contact
with a notorious
California motorcycle gang
which is the basis
of my new book,
'Hell's Angels.'"
- Signed
"Hunter Thompson."
- ( applause )
Uh, number two,
approximately how many members
do the Hell's Angels have?
It varies.
Anywhere from--
I'd say 100 to 200.
( rock music playing )
Brinkley:
HUNTER INFILTRATED
THE STORY.
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF
A PHOTOJOURNALIST.
IN HIS EARLY
APPLICATIONS FOR JOBS,
HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING
TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER.
Depp:
"THE SIGHT OF A PHOTOGRAPHER
INVARIABLY WHIPS THE ANGELS
INTO A KISSING FRENZY.
THIS IS A GUARANTEED
SQUARE-JOLTER,
AND THE ANGELS
ARE GLEEFULLY AWARE
OF THE REACTION IT GETS.
'THEY CAN'T STAND IT,'
SAYS TERRY.
'IT BLOWS THEIR MINDS
EVERY TIME--
ESPECIALLY
THE TONGUE BIT.'"
Wolfe: IT IS ONE
OF THE BRAVURA PIECES
OF REPORTING OF ALL TIME.
HE ACTUALLY, AS THEY SAY,
RAN WITH THE ANGELS FOR--
HE WAS EMBEDDED,
YOU KNOW?
HE WAS EMBEDDED
IN THE HELL'S ANGELS
BATTALION.
( rock music playing )
Depp:
"THE MENACE IS LOOSE AGAIN.
THE HELL'S ANGELS,
THE 100-CARAT HEADLINE,
RUNNING FAST AND LOUD
ON THE EARLY-MORNING FREEWAY
LIKE GENGHIS KHAN
ON AN IRON HORSE...
A MONSTROUS STEED
WITH A FIERY ANUS,
FLAT OUT THROUGH
THE EYE OF A BEER CAN
AND UP YOUR DAUGHTER'S LEG
WITH NO QUARTER ASKED
AND NONE GIVEN."
Brinkley:
IT WAS THE BEGINNING
OF HUNTER
DEVELOPING HIS STYLE.
IT IS NOT GONZO,
IT'S NOT SURREAL.
IT IS STRAIGHT JOURNALISM,
BUT IT'S PARTICIPATORY.
Depp:
"WEIRD AS IT SEEMS, AS THIS
GANG OF COSTUMED HOODLUMS
CONVERGED ON MONTEREY
THAT MORNING
THEY WERE ON THE VERGE
OF 'MAKING IT BIG,'
AS THE SHOWBIZ
PEOPLE SAY,
AND THEY WOULD OWE
MOST OF THEIR SUCCESS
TO A CURIOUS RAPE MANIA
THAT RIDES
ON THE SHOULDER
OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM
LIKE SOME JEERING,
MASTURBATING RAVEN.
NOTHING GRABS AN EDITOR'S
EYE LIKE A GOOD RAPE.
TO THEM, THE APPEARANCE
OF THE HELL'S ANGELS
MUST HAVE SEEMED
LIKE A WONDERFUL
PUBLICITY STUNT."
HELL'S ANGELS ACCUSED
OF RAPE AND PERVERSION,
THEFT, NARCOTICS
AND VIOLENCE.
AND THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL SAYS,
"THEY WILL NO LONGER BE
ALLOWED TO THREATEN
THE LIVES,
THE PEACE AND SECURITY
OF HONEST CITIZENS.
HELL'S ANGELS ARE
THE BIGGEST
OF THE OUTLAW
MOTORCYCLE CLUBS."
OH, SHIT!
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
( engine revs )
Depp:
"IN A NATION
OF FRIGHTENED DULLARDS
THERE'S ALWAYS A SORRY
SHORTAGE OF OUTLAWS,
AND THOSE FEW
WHO MAKE THE GRADE
ARE ALWAYS WELCOME.
THE HELL'S ANGELS POSE
FOR TELEVISION CAMERAMEN
AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS
ON RADIO CALL-IN SHOWS.
THEY WERE SOUGHT OUT
BY MYSTICS AND POETS,
CHEERED ON
BY STUDENT REBELS
AND INVITED TO PARTIES
GIVEN BY LIBERALS AND
INTELLECTUALS."
Number two,
who is the author
that sort of leads
the kind of LSD sect
out there
in Los--
San Francisco?
Ken Kesey.
Number two,
the Merry Pranksters
gave a party
for the Hell's Angels--
were you there?
- --that lasted two days?
- Yes.
WE'RE GOING
OUT ON AN OUTING--
ON A SUNDAY OUTING.
OH, THIS IS LOVELY.
YOU KNOW, OUR LITTLE FAMILY.
AND SO WE ENDED UP--
HUNTER SAID,
"OH, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING OVER--
LET'S GO JUST KIND
OF CHECK IT OUT."
THE BIG BANNERS
OUT THERE SAYING
"THE MERRY PRANKSTERS
WELCOME THE HELL'S ANGELS."
I THOUGHT I WAS
HAVING A LOT OF FUN.
JUAN WAS IN THE CAR ASLEEP.
EVERYBODY WAS ON ACID.
I WASN'T.HUNTER WASN'T.
HE HADN'T TAKEN ACID YET.
AND EVERYBODY IS
PRETTY HAPPY AND DANCING
AND THEN WATCHING
THIS FIVE-HOUR FILM
OR SOMETHING
KESEY HAD PUT TOGETHER.
AND WHEN WE LEFT...
HUNTER SAID,
"DID YOU KNOW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING IN THERE?"
AND I SAID,
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, THERE WAS
A GANGBANG GOING ON."
Hunter:
I'm watching it as
I was about six feet away.
See from the door,
the lights were on,
there was a kind of a filmy
curtain over the door.
You could see shadows moving
around on the side.  If you
knew what was happening--
you could interpret
the movements of all
these shadowy figures
behind this curtain--
silhouettes is what
they were.
You could see
people getting down on her,
other people holding her legs,
and really...
surrealistically
horrifying.
Brinkley:
THE TAPE RECORDER
FOR HUNTER WAS ESSENTIAL.
HE ALWAYS BROUGHT
A TAPE RECORDER--
LIKE THOSE FAMOUS-- NOW--
TAPES OF THE HELL'S
ANGELS PARTY.
( Hunter speaking )
Brinkley: THOSE TAPES BECAME
A BIG PART OF THE BOOK
"HELL'S ANGELS,"
BUT HE ALSO LOANED
THOSE TAPES TO TOM WOLFE.
WOLFE USED THOSE TAPES
AND EXTRACTED THINGS
FROM THEM FOR "THE ELECTRIC
KOOL-AID ACID TEST."
Wolfe:
I HAD A HARD TIME
WITH THE TAPE
ABOUT THE RAPE SCENE
AT THE HELL'S ANGELS PARTY.
IT WAS DYNAMITE,
FROM A REPORTING
POINT OF VIEW,
BUT THE THING WAS,
I KNEW WHO THE KEY FIGURES
IN THAT WERE.
ONE WAS THE EX-WIFE...
OF NEAL CASSADY.
AND SHE
QUITE WILLINGLY...
INVITED THE--
THE ENTIRE CORPS
OF HELL'S ANGELS
TO HAVE A GO AT HER.
Wright: IT WASN'T
THE KESEY PEOPLE WHO WERE
DOING THE GANGBANG.
THEY WERE ABOUT LOVE
AND HAPPINESS...
AND TOGETHERNESS
AND COMMUNITY...
AND LOVE AND LIGHT.
THEY WERE, THE ANGELS WEREN'T.
Depp:
"IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME
THAT MY LONG-STANDING
RAPPORT WITH THE ANGELS
BEGAN TO DETERIORATE.
FOR NEARLY A YEAR
I HAD LIVED IN A WORLD
THAT SEEMED, AT FIRST,
LIKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL.
IT WAS OBVIOUS
FROM THE BEGINNING
THAT THE MENACE
BORE LITTLE RESEMBLANCE
TO ITS PUBLICIZED IMAGE.
LATER, AS THEY ATTRACTED
MORE AND MORE ATTENTION,
THE MYSTIQUE
WAS STRETCHED SO THIN
THAT IT FINALLY
BECAME TRANSPARENT.
THE HONEYMOON
CAME TO A JANGLED END
ON OCTOBER 16th,
WHEN THE HELL'S ANGELS
ATTACKED A GET OUT OF
VIETNAM DEMONSTRATION
AT THE OAKLAND-BERKELEY
BORDER."
Man on TV:
The bike rider is
Clifford Workman,
treasurer
of the Hell's Angels.
He's here to challenge
his biographer,
a tense young
literary journalist
named Hunter Thompson.
What did you think
of the book?
Well, I'll tell you, Al
- and Hunter,
everybody in this room,
- ( audience laughs )
that that book
is 60% cheap trash.
This is what happened:
Junkie George was beating
his own lady.
- Al: Junkie George?
- ( audience laughs,
applause )
Clifford:
Junkie George's dog
bit him, right?
- Hunter: I didn't see--
- To me, this is a personal
affair.
If a guy wants to beat
his wife and his dog
bites him,
that's between
the three of them.
But there was somebody
about 30' to my left
beating his wife
to a pulp on the rocks.
If he had been beating her
that bad, somebody would
have stopped him.
Oh, no.Don't-- don't--
you're kidding me
and you're gonna
kid everybody else.
Nobody stopped him.
You know he beat his wife up.
You just said it, right?
You walked right up
to him and you said,
"Only a punk beats
his wife and dog."
- You finish it--
- And he said, "Hunter,
you want some of this?"
And you said, "No."
But you got it anyways.
And when he hit you,
three or four others
hit you too.
We let them beat him up
for a minute,
then we broke it up
and told him to get
out of there.
He left
and got in his car.
Well, uh--
he says that he went
to the police station
all bloodied-up
and they threw him out,
which is malarkey.
I mean, but it's part
of his style of writing.
Depp:
"MY FACE LOOKED LIKE
IT HAD BEEN JAMMED
INTO THE SPOKES
OF A SPEEDING HARLEY,
AND THE ONLY THING
KEEPING ME AWAKE
WAS THE SPASTIC PAIN
OF A BROKEN RIB.
IT HAD BEEN
A BAD TRIP--
FAST AND WILD
IN SOME MOMENTS,
SLOW AND DIRTY IN OTHERS,
BUT ON BALANCE
IT LOOKED LIKE A BUMMER.
ON MY WAY BACK
TO SAN FRANCISCO,
I TRIED TO COMPOSE
A FITTING EPITAPH.
I WANTED
SOMETHING ORIGINAL,
BUT THERE WAS NO ESCAPING
THE ECHO OF MISTAH KURTZ'S
FINAL WORDS
FROM THE 'HEART
OF DARKNESS':
'THE HORROR!
THE HORROR!
EXTERMINATE
ALL THE BRUTES!'"
Brinkley:
ALTHOUGH "HELL'S ANGELS"
ROCKETED HIM
TO NAME RECOGNITION
AND SUCCESS,
HE DIDN'T SEE IT HIMSELF
AS BEING THE SUCCESSFUL BOOK
THAT HE WANTED.
IT DIDN'T SELL ENOUGH
FOR HIM,
EVEN THOUGH IT MADE
THE BEST-SELLER LIST.
HE DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH
MONEY OFF OF IT.HE FELT
RIPPED OFF BY THE PUBLISHER.
HE GOT FRUSTRATED
WITH THAT.
HE HAD THOUGHT THAT IT
WOULD BE THE HOME RUN,
BUT WHAT IT DID DO,
THAT BOOK MADE HIM REALIZE
THAT THERE WAS A MARKET
IN THE FREAK CIRCUS
OF THE '60s.
( "It's No Secret"
playing )
Brinkley:
AND IT BECAME THIS THING
GOING ON OUT IN THE BAY AREA
AND HUNTER WAS
DEEPLY PART OF IT.
HE USED TO DRIVE
HIS BSA LIGHTNING MOTORBIKE
AND GO TO
THE MATRIX AND BEFRIENDED
JEFFERSON AIRPLANE.
HE HAD A HUGE CRUSH
ON GRACE SLICK.
* OH!
* IS IT ANY WONDER
WHY I FEEL LIKE *
* MY WHOLE
LIFE IS THROUGH? *
* YEAH!
* WHEN I STOP FEELING
HOW STRONG MY LOVE
IS FOR YOU... *
Jann Wenner:
THE SAN FRANCISCO
BAY AREA WAS A HOTBED
OF LIVE
ROCK 'N' ROLL STUFF,
DRUG CULTURE,
PSYCHEDELICS, KESEY,
POLITICS,
CAMPUS ACTIVISM.
IT WAS MORE ON THE EDGE
CULTURALLY
THAN ANY OTHER
PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.
THERE'S MORE FREEDOM THERE.
"ROLLING STONE"
BEGAN AND MERGED
ALL THOSE ELEMENTS.
AND WE JUST THOUGHT
THERE WAS A TIME FOR
A NEW KIND OF POLITICS
AND IT WOULD EMERGE
OUT OF THE ROCK 'N' ROLL
CONSCIOUSNESS
AND THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
ETHOS AND THAT IDEA.
* TODAY I FEEL LIKE
PLEASING YOU *
* MORE THAN BEFORE...
Wright:
THE ENERGY WAS
JUST PHENOMENAL.
IT WAS LIKE
LOSING YOUR IDENTITY
AND BEING
JUST KIND OF SUCKED...
INTO WHATEVER,
YOU KNOW?
WHATEVER--
WHATEVER THIS WAS,
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
MAGICAL SOMETHING OR OTHER.
* ...ALL I WANT TO DO
* TO BE LOVING YOU
* IT'LL ALL BE THERE WHEN
MY DREAMS COME TRUE... *
Tim Crouse:
HUNTER WAS A ROMANTIC.
HUNTER'S UTOPIA,
WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED
BEFORE I MET HIM,
WAS SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE EARLY '60s.
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS
TWO GREAT MORAL PRESSURES--
THE WAR
AND CIVIL RIGHTS.
- ( clamoring )
- * TODAY YOU'LL
MAKE ME SAY... *
Buchanan:
THERE'S BITTERNESS AND
NASTINESS TO POLITICS TODAY,
BUT I DON'T SENSE
THE SAME ANGER AND RAGE
THAT WE HAD
IN THE 1960s--
ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS,
RIOTS,
DISORDERS OF RACIAL CONFLICT,
THE GENERATIONAL CONFLICT.
AND HUNTER WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT.
* ...ANY MORE
THAN ALL I AM *
* WOULD BE A LIE...
Brinkley:
THE LAST PERIOD
WHERE THERE WAS AN OPTIMISM
IN HUNTER ABOUT AMERICA
WERE THE KENNEDYS,
WITH JOHN KENNEDY
AND BOBBY KENNEDY.
HUNTER LIKED THAT THEY
HAD SUCH HUBRIS.
THEY COULD BE GOOD POLITICIANS
BUT PLAY HARD AT MIDNIGHT.
THAT MEANT A LOT.
THOSE WERE HIS GUYS.
I WANT
THE POLITICS OF HOPE,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
WE CAN DO BETTER
IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT WE CAN SAY
THAT WE ARE JOYOUS
OR THAT WE ARE HAPPY
IF 590 AMERICANS ARE KILLED
IN VIETNAM LAST WEEK
AND IF WE HAVE RIOTING
IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL.
I THINK THAT
WE CAN DO BETTER.
* ...ALL FOR YOU.
( gunshot )
( people screaming )
Depp:
"THE DAY AFTER
ROBERT KENNEDY DIED
I RECEIVED A NOTICE
FROM THE LOCAL RAILWAY
EXPRESS OFFICE
SAYING MY WALTHER P-38
AUTOMATIC PISTOL
HAD ARRIVED.
WE SHOT IT ONE AFTERNOON,
AGREEING THAT IT HAD A VERY
SMOOTH ACTION...
AND THEN I SENT IT BACK.
RETURNING THE P-38
SOLVED NOTHING.
IT ONLY POSTPONED
THE NECESSITY
OF COMING TO GRIPS
WITH MY GUN PROBLEM."
- ( gunshots )
- * HEY, JOE...
* WHERE YOU GOIN'
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? *
Brinkley: HUNTER SAW GUNS
AS ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS IN LIFE.
HE LOVED SHOOTING THEM
AND FIRING THEM WHENEVER
HE COULD.
* WHERE YOU GOIN'
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? *
WHEN HE'S AT BIG SUR,
HE WOULD GO
WILD-BOAR,
WILD-PIG HUNTING
WITH A SUBMACHINE GUN.
( gunshots )
Juan Thompson:
I HAD A BB GUN WHEN I WAS
LIKE SEVEN, PROBABLY.
THOSE ARE SOME
OF MY BEST MEMORIES
FROM THAT TIME,
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING
WE BOTH ENJOYED DOING,
BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE
IT WAS TIME
WE WERE BUILDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP
AS A FATHER AND SON,
AND NOT JUST AS KIND
OF ROOMMATES.
Wenner:
THE GUNS-- THEY WEREN'T
JUST FOR AMUSEMENT.
HE LIKED THE NOISE,
THE VIOLENCE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF IT.
AND HE HAD THAT
IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE TOO.
WE HAD
A REAL VIOLENT STREAK.
Wright:
THE FIRST TIME
HE TOOK ACID, HUNTER SAYS,
"SONDI, GET ME THE GUN."
I SAID, "I CAN'T
GET YOU THE GUN.
I'M TERRIFIED
SOMETHING IS GONNA
HAPPEN TO JUAN."
AND-- AND HUNTER SAYS,
"YOU GET ME THAT GUN
OR I'M THROWING THIS BOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW."
HE THROWS THE BOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
( mimics glass shattering )
Depp: "HAD MY BRAIN
TURNED INTO JELLY FROM
TOO MUCH ACID?
WHAT WAS I DOING
WITH ALL THESE GUNS?
MY ANGST BEGAN
TO FESTER
AS THE GUN-CONTROL ARGUMENT
RAGED CLOSER TO HOME.
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
BEGAN TELLING EACH OTHER
THAT THE GUN
WAS THE ULTIMATE CURE
FOR WHAT AILS US...
THE AMERICAN WAY."
Brinkley:
BY 1968, HUNTER
TAKES ON THIS IDEA
THAT HE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO WRITE ON THE DEATH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
AND HUNTER THOUGHT
THAT COVERING POLITICS--
'68 WAS GONNA
BE THE BOOK.
( rock music playing )
Depp:
"I WENT TO CHICAGO
AS A JOURNALIST.
MY CANDIDATE HAD BEEN
MURDERED IN LOS ANGELES
TWO MONTHS EARLIER."
* COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON *
* COME ON
* DIDN'T I MAKE
YOU FEEL... *
Crouse:
HUNTER WAS IN CHICAGO RIGHT
IN THE MIDST OF THE GAS
AND THE BEATINGS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
AND I THINK THAT
THAT WAS A MILESTONE EVENT
FOR HUNTER
THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER.
AND HE NEVER
FORGAVE HUMPHREY
WHO WAS THE CANDIDATE,
AND HE NEVER
FORGAVE MUSKIE WHO WAS THE
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
FOR SUPPORTING MAYOR DALEY
AND HIS CHICAGO POLICE.
* TAKE IT,
TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE
OF MY HEART NOW, BABY... *
Depp:
"I WITNESSED AT LEAST
10 BEATINGS IN CHICAGO
THAT WERE WORSE
THAN ANYTHING I EVER
SAW THE HELL'S ANGELS DO.
I LEFT IN A STATE
OF HYSTERICAL ANGST,
CONVINCED
BY WHAT I HAD SEEN
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS
CLUBBING ITSELF TO DEATH."
* IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL GOOD... *
Wright: THERE WERE ONLY TEARS
TWICE THAT I REMEMBER EVER
IN OUR 19 YEARS TOGETHER.
I REMEMBER ONE,
WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM
THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
AND HE WAS TELLING ME
THE STORIES
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
BEING BEATEN
AND HE-- YOU KNOW,
THE TEARS JUST--
AND THAT WAS
VERY-- YOU KNOW.
IT WAS--
HUNTER WAS A MAN
THAT DIDN'T CRY.
* AND BABY, DEEP DOWN
IN YOUR HEART... *
Wright:
AND HE CARED SO MUCH.
HUNTER WAS A PATRIOT.
HE KNEW THE CONSTITUTION,
HE CARED ABOUT IT,
AND THEN THERE HE WAS
IN CHICAGO AND IT'S ALL
BEING DESTROYED.
( Janis Joplin shrieks )
* TAKE IT, TAKE
ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE... *
Wright:
I THINK CHICAGO
INSPIRED HIM TO DO--
TO DO MORE,
TO GET MORE INVOLVED.
* TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE
PIECE OF MY HEART *
- * NOW, DARLING,
YEAH YEAH YEAH *
- * OH, HAVE A...
Wenner:
RIGHT AWAY, RIOTS STARTED--
CHICAGO, '68 TOOK PLACE.
THEN THAT WAS
KIND OF A RADICALIZING,
GALVANIZING EVENT.
WE WERE ALREADY ESCHEWING
MAINSTREAM NOSTALGIA
IN POLITICS
SAYING, "LOOK,
THE SYSTEM IS TOO RIGGED.
POLITICS IS...
FINE, BUT IN
SOME OTHER VENUE."
I GOT A LETTER FROM HUNTER
OUT OF THE BLUE,
COMPLIMENTING ME
ON "ROLLING STONE,"
HOW MUCH HE LIKED IT.
SO I WROTE HIM BACK
AND SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING THESE DAYS?
I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
IN THE MAGAZINE."
THEN HE MENTIONED
HE WAS RUNNING FOR SHERIFF.
SO I SAID,
"HOW ABOUT THAT?
SOUNDS GREAT."
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
WE WOULD RUN TODAY,
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY
RUNNING FOR SHERIFF IN ASPEN,
TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE TOWN.
James Salter:
Hunter Thompson is a moralist
posing as an immoralist.
Nixon is an immoralist
disguised as a moralist.
This is James Salter.
There'll be thieves
and auto wrecks in Aspen
whoever gets elected,
but Hunter represents
something wholly alien
to the other candidates
for sheriff--
ideas,
and the sympathy
towards the young, generous,
grass-oriented society,
which is making
the only serious effort
to face the technological
nightmare we have created.
The only thing
against him is
he is a visionary
who wants to cure
the world.
George Stranahan:
FIRST OF ALL, HE DROVE
EVERYBODY BATSHIT NUTS.
HUNTER WAS MY FRIEND
AND NEIGHBOR,
THE MAN WHO
NEVER PAID HIS RENT,
BROKE UP MY MARRIAGE
AND TAUGHT MY CHILDREN
TO SMOKE DOPE.
NOW HUNTER
WAS OUTRAGEOUS,
BUT THERE WAS
SUCH A SORT OF MOVEMENT
THAT THIS GUY
MAY BE CRAZY,
BUT BETTER THAT
THAN WHITMIRE.
( bell tolling )
Announcer:
The American sheriff's job was
carved out of the rugged West.
It was a desperately-
needed position
of few words, much action,
and little praise or glory.
Today the sheriff has
reams of responsibility.
But still-- as in the past--
the number-one responsibility
is to protect his people
and enforce their laws.
Vote for and elect
Carrol Whitmire
for our sheriff.
I THINK A LOT OF PLACES
ARE BEYOND THIS KIND
OF POLITICS.
WE SEEMED TO BE RUNNING
AN EXPERIMENT THAT PEOPLE
WERE WATCHING.
Stranahan:
HUNTER CAME TO ASPEN,
HE HAD MOVED INTO OUR FARM.
HUNTER LIKED
TO TALK POLITICS.
I WAS JUST AT THAT AGE
OF WAR PROTEST-- 1968.
I WAS BECOMING
POLITICAL...
AND SO HUNTER AND I
HAD A LOT IN COMMON
TO TALK ABOUT.
Bob Braudis:
ASPEN THEN WAS A MAGNET
FOR INTELLECTUALS
WHO WANTED TO DROP OUT.
AND HUNTER CONVINCED US
THAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE MUCH EFFECT
ON WHAT HAPPENED
IN WASHINGTON
DAY TO DAY
AND WHAT HAPPENED
IN WASHINGTON FROM DAY TO DAY
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON US.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN PITKIN COUNTY
HAD A VISCERAL,
DAILY, HOURLY
EFFECT ON THE WAY
WE LIVED HERE.
PEOPLE DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT ASPEN
WAS A BATTLEGROUND.
ASPEN WAS MORE
OF A DISNEYLAND.
HUNTER WAS A VISIONARY.
HE UNDERSTOOD MORE
ABOUT LAND USE
AND DEVELOPMENT
THAN ANY OF US DID.
NOBODY AT THE TIME
WAS STANDING UP TO
THE BULLDOZERS.
"TENTATIVE PLATFORM,
THOMPSON FOR SHERIFF,
ASPEN, COLORADO, 1970:
1-- RIP UP ALL CITY STREETS
WITH JACKHAMMERS
AND SOD THE STREETS
AT ONCE.
2-- CHANGE THE NAME 'ASPEN'
TO 'FAT CITY.'
THIS WOULD PREVENT
GREEDHEADS, LAND-RAPERS
AND OTHER HUMAN JACKALS
FROM CAPITALIZING ON
THE NAME 'ASPEN.'
THESE SWINES SHOULD BE
FUCKED, BROKEN,
AND DRIVEN
ACROSS THE LAND.
3-- IT WILL BE
THE GENERAL PHILOSOPHY
OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE
THAT NO DRUG WORTH TAKING
SHOULD BE SOLD
FOR MONEY.
MY FIRST ACT AS SHERIFF
WILL BE TO INSTALL
ON THE COURTHOUSE LAWN
A SET OF STOCKS
IN ORDER TO PUNISH
DISHONEST DOPE DEALERS
IN A PROPER
PUBLIC FASHION."
( "Walk on the Wild Side"
playing )
Juan:
I WAS ONLY ABOUT SIX
AT THE TIME,
BUT LEGEND HAS IT
THAT MY FATHER SHAVED
HIS HEAD
SO HE COULD SAY,
"UNLIKE MY LONG-HAIRED
OPPONENT, SHERIFF WHITMIRE."
I JUST WISH I COULD
HAVE BEEN OLD ENOUGH
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE'S REACTION
ABOUT THIS CRAZY,
BALD, FREAK DRUG-FIEND
WHO WAS ABOUT
TO TAKE OVER THE WHOLE
POLITICAL MECHANISM.
* HOLLY CAME
FROM MIAMI, F.L.A... *
HUNTER THOMPSON
IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE
WHO HAS THE IMAGINATION
AND INTELLIGENCE TO BE
A LAW-ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVE.
ELECT HUNTER THOMPSON
SHERIFF.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
LISTENING!
WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY
LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE?!
( screams )
THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
* HEY, HONEY, TAKE
A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE... *
( woman laughs,
applauds )
Braudis: AT THE START,
I THINK IT WAS MORE TO GET
A MESSAGE OUT
KNOWING THAT DEFEAT
WAS CERTAIN.
THE SERIOUS COMPONENT
OF HUNTER'S CAMPAIGN
SNOWBALLED
AND, AS THE MOVEMENT
GAINED MOMENTUM,
I THINK HUNTER
ACTUALLY BELIEVED
THAT HE HAD A CHANCE.
AND A LOT OF US THAT
WERE SUPPORTING HUNTER
SHARED THAT BELIEF.
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET TOGETHER A LIST
OF ENDORSEMENTS
FOR HUNTER THOMPSON
FOR SHERIFF.
Braudis:
WE WERE ALL FREAKS--
THE PEOPLE
WHO CAME TOGETHER
IN SUPPORT OF HUNTER--
BUT I THINK OUR BIGGEST
ISSUE AT THE TIME WAS
THE ENVIRONMENT,
AND A SECONDARY ISSUE
WAS THE ILLEGAL STATUS
OF DRUGS.
WHAT IS THAT
YOU'RE SMOKING?
THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE
TO BE MARIJUANA.
( all laugh )
- YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TELL?
- ( laughs )
AN AWFUL LOT OF US
WERE SMOKING DOPE
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAID,
"THOU SHALT NOT."
WE SAID, "WE SHALL."
MARIJUANA LAWS ARE
ONE OF THE REASONS
THAT HAS ENGENDERED
THIS LACK OF RESPECT
THAT COPS COMPLAIN ABOUT
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
WHEN YOU GET A WHOLE
GENERATION THAT GROWS UP
AS FELONS, THEY KNOW
THE LAW IS RIDICULOUS
AND THEY'RE TOLD US
ALL THIS GIBBERISH ABOUT IT--
"IT DRIVES YOU CRAZY
AND MAKES YOUR BRAIN SOFT,
AND YOUR FEET FALL OFF."
( all laughing )
EVEN THE POLICE KNOW
IT'S A SILLY LAW.
IT'S TIME THAT
WE EITHER BRIDGE
THAT CHASM
WITH SOME KIND OF REALISTIC
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ELSE--
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
BE BRIDGED IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO REVOLUTION.
Wright:
I THINK THAT WAS
ONE OF HUNTER'S
GREATEST TIMES,
MYSELF.
HE HAD THE PASSION
TO MOVE PEOPLE,
CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING,
MAKE THEM ACT
AND BRING THEM OUT--
NOT JUST DEFY AUTHORITY
AND TAKE AS MANY DRUGS
AS YOU WANT,
BUT TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
TRYING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM,
MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK
AND MAKE
THE SYSTEM GOOD.
HE HAD THAT IN HIM.
Whitmire:
IF HE WAS ELECTED SHERIFF,
I CAN FORESEE
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE
AN INFLUX OF WHAT WE
CALL THE HIPPIES.
AND I THINK
IF THIS HAPPENED,
IT WOULD ACTUALLY
DESTROY ASPEN.
Man:
WHEN YOU PUBLICLY COME OUT
WITH STATEMENTS
OF MESCALINE,
MARIJUANA--
MY GOOD GOD!
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
OF AMERICAN LIFE.
* YOU WALK
INTO THE ROOM *
* WITH YOUR PENCIL
IN YOUR HAND *
* YOU SEE
SOMEBODY NAKED *
* AND YOU SAY,
"WHO IS THAT, MAN?" *
THEY ARE RAPING
OUR FORESTS.SOME OF THEM
ARE LIVING LIKE ANIMALS.
* BECAUSE SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING HERE *
* BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS *
* DO YOU,
MR. JONES? *
HUNTER THOMPSON...
HAS NO GRIP ON REALITY.
I THINK HE'S PSYCHOTIC.
I THINK IF THERE WAS EVER
GONNA BE ANY EXCESSES
WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT,
I'D LOOK FOR MORE
OUT OF HUNTER THOMPSON
THAN CARROL WHITMIRE.
* AND YOU GO WATCH
THE GEEK... *
Braudis:
HE WAS A REDNECK
AND VERY POPULAR
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO
CONTROLLED THIS VALLEY THEN.
THEY DIDN'T WANT
A SMART SHERIFF.
THEY WANTED PEOPLE
WHO WOULD DO THEIR BIDDING.
* BE SUCH A FREAK...
I'M NOT AT ALL
EMBARRASSED AT THE USE
OF THE WORD "FREAK."
I THINK THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING,
IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY
IT'S A VERY
HONORABLE DESIGNATION.
I'M PROUD OF IT.
* AND SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING HERE... *
Hunter:
WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE,
AN ISOLATED TOWN,
WITH A VERY UNUSUAL
KIND OF POPULATION.
WE DO HAVE
A FREAK POWER BASE.
IT'S UNDENIABLE.
WE HAVE
ABOUT 1,000 VOTES
THAT WOULDN'T--
IF I WENT OUT THERE AND WALKED
THROUGH THE STREETS NAKED
WITH A BOMB IN EACH HAND,
( laughs )
THEY WOULD STILL VOTE FOR ME.
Braudis:
ONE OF HUNTER'S
"FREAK POWER" TOOLS
WAS TO REGISTER PEOPLE
WHO HAD NEVER VOTED BEFORE.
- OKAY, WHERE'S
THIS VOTING PLACE?
- ( laughs )
- HUNTER, 182;
WHITMIRE, 137.
- ( phone rings )
- RICKS, 10.
- YEAH!RIGHT!
( all cheering )
Woman:
ONE COULD DO IT,
ONE COULD DO IT.
THE SUBURBS--
THE SILENT MAJORITY.
- OKAY, HERE'S THE TOTALS.
- Man: HE'S NOT AVAILABLE
RIGHT AT THIS SECOND.
WHITMIRE, 204;
- HUNTER, 173.
- ( murmuring )
OKAY, UH...
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT PROVED WHAT
I SET OUT TO PROVE--
AND IT WAS MORE
A POLITICAL POINT
THAN A LOCAL ELECTION--
- THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
REALLY IS --.
- ( bleeps )
VERY HARD TO HAVE
A BALDHEADED LUNATIC--
I'LL DO THAT
FOR THE CAMERAS.
HEY, YOU FELLOWS.
Man:
ALL RIGHT!
AND WE MADE A MISTAKE
IN THINKING...
THAT THE TOWN WAS
READY FOR AN HONEST
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
Depp:
"WE FRIGHTEN
THE BASTARDS SO BADLY
THAT ON ELECTION DAY
THEY ROLLED PEOPLE
IN WHEELCHAIRS--
EVEN ON STRETCHERS--
INTO THE POLLING PLACES
TO VOTE AGAINST US.
AND WHEN I LOST,
THEY INSTANTLY GOT
DOWN TO MAKING SURE
THAT NOBODY
LIKE ME COULD EVER
RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN."
WE RAN THAT STORY,
HAD THE INFAMOUS POSTER
OF A TWO-THUMBED HAND
HOLDING A PEYOTE BUTTON.
HE CAME IN
AND TALKED TO AN EDITOR
NAMED JOHN LOMBARDI.
AFTERWARDS, LOMBARDI,
WHO WAS FROM PHILADELPHIA
AND WAS NOT QUITE USED
TO THE WEST COAST CRAZY--
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
THAT HUNTER THOMPSON
IS WEIRD.
HE'S REALLY WEIRD.
HE CAME IN WITH A BOX
FULL OF WIGS AND HATS.
HE WAS TAKING THEM OFF
AND PUTTING THEM ON
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CONVERSATION."
( "Sympathy for the Devil"
playing )
* PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF *
* I'M A MAN OF WEALTH
AND TASTE... *
Wenner:
RALPH IS CRAZIER
THAN HUNTER EVER WAS.
WHEREAS HUNTER COULD ALWAYS
PULL BACK FROM THE EDGE,
RALPH WAS
A TRUE BELIEVER.
AND IF IT WAS TIME
TO TAKE
THE FUCKING THING DOWN,
RALPH WAS PREPARED
TO GO IN LIKE GUY FAWKES
AND BLOW UP PARLIAMENT.
AND SO WE HAD
THIS PURITY OF VISION,
AND HUNTER SAW THAT.
I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE.
I WONDER WHERE.
* PLEASED
TO MEET YOU... *
HAVE I SEEN YOU
SOMEWHERE BEFORE?
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
ARE YOU LISTENING?
PLEASE!
Stewardess: On behalf
of Rocky Mountain Airways
and your flight crew,
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us today.
Have a pleasant stay
in Aspen
or wherever your final
destination might be.
Steadman:
I THINK WHAT
HE SAW IN THIS CONNECTION
WAS SOMEBODY THAT SOMEHOW
SAW THE THING IN PICTURES
AS HE SAW IT IN WORDS.
AND THAT SEEMED TO ME
TO BE PART
OF THE WHOLE CHEMISTRY,
OF OUR CHEMISTRY,
THAT MADE GONZO
POSSIBLE.
HERE I GO.
Perry:
I'VE SEEN THE ILLUSTRATIONS
STEADMAN WAS DOING
BEFORE HE WORKED
WITH HUNTER.
HE WAS MUCH MORE
CONVENTIONAL BEFORE HUNTER
GOT AHOLD OF HIM.
HUNTER TOLD ME
HE LIKED STEADMAN'S STUFF,
SO HE ASKED HIM
TO HELP HIM COVER
THE KENTUCKY DERBY
FOR A MAGAZINE
CALLED "SCANLAN'S."
AND RALPH TOLD ME
AS SOON AS HE GOT OFF
THE AIRPLANE,
HUNTER GAVE HIM
SOME PSILOCYBIN
AND HIS LIFE CHANGED.
- COME ON, BUDDY.
- COME ON, HEY!
HUNTER!
* WHEN AFTER ALL
IT WAS YOU AND ME... *
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
Wright: RALPH--
WHEN HE FIRST MET HUNTER,
HE'D NEVER DONE
ANY DRUGS.
HE DRANK, BUT HE'D NEVER
DONE ANYTHING HALLUCINOGENIC.
AND SO HERE COMES HUNTER,
HE GIVES HIM MESCALINE
AND HE LOSES IT.
YOU KNOW,
RALPH LOSES IT.
Steadman:
I WAS A CHOIRBOY--
YOU KNOW, DECENT,
INNOCENT ABROAD.
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE.
AND SO I GUESS
IT WAS ATTRACTIVE,
THAT KIND OF RACINESS.
* OH, YEAH
* GET DOWN, BABY...
Steadman:
I THINK THE BIRTH
OF GONZO HAPPENED
WHEN THE EVIL CAME OUT
OF ME IN THE DRAWINGS.
Depp:
"UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHERS
IN THE PRESS BOX,
WE DIDN'T GIVE
A HOOT IN HELL WHAT WAS
HAPPENING ON THE TRACK.
WE HAD COME TO WATCH
THE REAL BEASTS PERFORM.
WHEN THE CROWD STOOD
TO FACE THE FLAG
AND SING
'MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME,'
STEADMAN FACED THE CROWD
AND SKETCHED FRANTICALLY.
THOUSANDS OF RAVING,
STUMBLING DRUNKS
GETTING ANGRIER
AND ANGRIER AS THEY LOSE
MORE AND MORE MONEY."
Wolfe:
IN THAT STORY, YOU GET
ALL OF THE ATTITUDES
TO THE DERBY,
AND YOU NEVER
GET TO THE DERBY.
YOU'RE THERE TO--
HE SAID TO COME TO THE DERBY,
AND YOU GET ALL
THE DRUNK SOUTHERNERS,
YOU GET ALL
THE WEIRD SOCIALITES,
THE WEIRD BOOKIES,
THE HANGERS-ON.
Depp:
"IT WAS A FACE
I'D SEEN A THOUSAND TIMES
AT EVERY DERBY
I'D BEEN TO.
I SAW IT
IN MY HEAD AS THE MASK
OF THE WHISKEY GENTRY--
THE INEVITABLE RESULT
OF TOO MUCH INBREEDING."
Hunter:
FIRST, I'D REALIZED I WAS
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
A FRIEND OF MINE,
HE WROTE ME A NOTE SAYING
"THAT DERBY PIECE
WAS PURE GONZO."
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL,
IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS..."
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BRUTAL FAILURE.
I'D BOTCHED MY ASSIGNMENT,
YOU KNOW?
IT WAS ONE
OF MY WORST FAILURES
AND I GOT THIS ONSLAUGHT
OF MAIL-- MAIL, CALLS--
SAYING I MADE
A GREAT BREAKTHROUGH
IN JOURNALISM.
WELL, CHRIST,
IF I MADE IT--
AS A BREAKTHROUGH,
WE'VE GOTTA CALL IT
SOMETHING.
SO I LIKED THE WORD "GONZO,"
AND IT SEEMED TO ME
WHAT I WAS DOING--
KIND OF NICE AND CRAZY,
LIKE ZEN. GONZO.
* HOPE YOU GUESS
MY NAME... *
- I'M EDWARD.
- Steadman: HE HAS
A BIRD CALLED EDWARD.
HE'S SUCH
A MARVELOUS CHARACTER.
I THINK HUNTER
TORMENTED IT, BUT IT WAS
KIND OF A TWO-WAY AFFECTION.
HUNTER WOULD USE IT,
I THINK, TO BOUNCE OFF,
TO BRING
INTO THE STORY
HOW HE WAS
FEELING ABOUT IT,
WHO WAS THE BIRD.
I SUPPOSE THAT
AT SOME POINT I, IN A WAY,
BECAME THE BIRD.
SPEAK UP, EDWARD.
SPEAK UP! SPEAK UP!
TALK TO ME!
HE BANGED THE CAGE--
BANG BANG BANG BANG!
"EDWARD.
IT'S ME, EDWARD.
I'M COMING
TO GET YOU, EDWARD."
HE'D OPEN THE CAGE,
AND HE'D SAY, "EDWARD,
THERE IS NO BIRD GOD
THAT'S GONNA HELP YOU
NOW, EDWARD."
AND THIS BIRD'S GOING...
( mimics bird )
( squawking )
Steadman:
I FEEL LIKE EDWARD
SOMETIMES...
NOW, WE'RE GOING
TO TALK, EDWARD.
Steadman:
...HOLDING ME LIKE A BIRD,
AND I'M TRYING TO BITE
MY WAY OUT OF IT.
I NEVER FELT FEAR
WHEN HE WAS
AT THE WHEEL.
THERE'S NO HOLES
OVER HERE.
- OOH!
- THIS IS A BIG BOX.
NO WONDER WHY I DON'T BUY
AMERICAN CARS. GOD DAMN IT.
MOVE OVER,
I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY!
YOU'RE TOO SMALL!
- I WANT TO KILL SOMEBODY
A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU!
- ( tires screeching )
- WHAT'S THE SPEED LIMIT?
- 70. OH MY GOD, IT'S 75.
HOLY SHIT.
NO WONDER HE'S GOING--
Duke's voice:
WE WERE SOMEWHERE
AROUND BARSTOW,
ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT,
WHEN THE DRUGS BEGAN
TO TAKE HOLD.
SUDDENLY, THERE WAS
A TERRIBLE ROAR
ALL AROUND US
AND THE SKY WAS
FULL OF WHAT LOOKED
LIKE HUGE BATS,
ALL SWOOPING
AND SCREECHING AND
DIVING AROUND THE CAR.
AND A VOICE WAS SCREAMING,
"HOLY JESUS, WHAT ARE THESE
GODDAMN ANIMALS?!"
( yelling softly )
( screeches )
DID YOU SAY
SOMETHING?HUH?
NEVER MIND.
- IT'S YOUR TURN TO DRIVE.
- * EVERYBODY'S DANCING... *
Duke's voice:
"NO POINT IN MENTIONING
THESE BATS," I THOUGHT.
"THE POOR BASTARD
WILL SEE THEM SOON ENOUGH."
Wenner: "FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS"-- IT STARTS
OFF LIKE A ROCKET.
"WE WERE SOMEWHERE
ON THE EDGE OF BARSTOW
WHEN THE DRUGS BEGAN
TO TAKE HOLD."
WELL, THAT JUST GRABS YOU--
DAMN-- RIGHT THERE,
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUNK
WHAT WAS IN THE TRUNK--
ALL THE DRUGS,
THE SALT SHAKERS
FULL OF MESCALINE, COCAINE--
ON AND ON AND ON.
IT WAS MAD GENIUS STUFF.
Duke's voice:
WE HAD TWO BAGS OF GRASS,
75 PELLETS OF MESCALINE,
FIVE SHEETS OF HIGH-POWERED
BLOTTER ACID,
- A SALT SHAKER
HALF-FULL OF COCAINE...
- ( bat screeching )
...A PINT OF RAW ETHER,
AND TWO DOZEN AMYLS.
NOT THAT WE NEEDED
ALL THAT FOR THE TRIP,
BUT ONCE YOU GET
LOCKED INTO A SERIOUS
DRUG COLLECTION,
THE TENDENCY IS TO PUSH IT
AS FAR AS YOU CAN.
* DON'T MATTER
WHERE YOU COME FROM... *
Radio host:
A House subcommittee report
says illegal drugs
killed 160 American
GIs last year,
40 of them
in Vietnam. Drugs--
- * One toke over
the line, sweet Jesus... *
- ONE TOKE, MAN!
* ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE
* SITTIN' DOWNTOWN
IN A RAILWAY STATION *
* ONE TOKE
OVER THE LINE... *
Wenner: THROUGH ALL
THIS TIME, HE'S TRAVELING
WITH OSCAR ACOSTA.
THEY WENT THERE AND HAD
THIS DRUG RAMPAGE.
- I FOUND SOME GOOD GRASS
FOR $12 A LID.
- Hunter: GOOD.
- I JUST ORDERED TWO LIDS.
I'LL GET IT TOMORROW.
- GOD BLESS YOU.
Wenner:
HUNTER'S RAOUL DUKE--
THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK--
WE PUBLISHED WHATEVER WAS
PUBLISHED IN "ROLLING STONE."
IT WAS PUBLISHED
AS "BY RAOUL DUKE."
OSCAR TRANSMOGRIFIES
FROM OSCAR ZETA ACOSTA,
CRUSADING CHICANO ATTORNEY,
INTO DR. GONZO.
* I FELT THE JOY
AND I LEARNED ABOUT
THE PAIN *
* THEN MY MAMA SAID...
Laila Nabulsi:
RAOUL DUKE AND DR. GONZO
WERE HUNTER THOMPSON
AND OSCAR ACOSTA.
HE JUST USED THAT
AS A COVER.
YOU HAVE THESE
SORT OF ANTIHEROES.
IT'S "BUTCH CASSIDY
AND THE SUNDANCE KID."
IT'S JUST THE NEXT
VERSION IN A WAY.
THEY'RE OUTLAWS.
THESE GUYS WERE FIGHTING
AND THEY REALLY
WERE IN REAL LIFE.
OSCAR ACOSTA WAS
USING THE LAW
AND THE BROWN POWER MOVEMENT
AND HUNTER WAS
FIGHTING WITH THE PEN
AND USING JOURNALISM.
SO THEY REALLY WERE WARRIORS
OF THEIR GENERATION.
* ...IN A RAILWAY STATION,
ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE *
* ONE TOKE, ONE TOKE
OVER THE LINE. *
Brinkley:
WHEN HUNTER WENT
TO LAS VEGAS,
HE WAS ON AN ASSIGNMENT
FOR "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
TO WRITE ABOUT
THIS MOTORCYCLE RACE.
THEY ONLY WANTED
A VERY BRIEF, ALMOST LIKE
A LITTLE BOX ABOUT THE RACE.
HE DELIVERED
THIS SCREED THAT WENT ON
FOR ABOUT 60 PAGES
DETAILING THE DESERT
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.
AND IT HAD IN IT
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
WILD, DRUGGY...
FEEL THAT THE FINAL
"FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS" HAD.
Duke's voice:
IGNORE THIS TERRIBLE DRUG.
PRETEND IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
UH... HI THERE!
( groans )
MY NAME...
UH...
- RAOUL DUKE.
- YOUR SUITE ISN'T
READY YET, BUT...
( hisses, voice distorts )
SOMEONE WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.
( yells )
NO! WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET. MOVE!
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
AT THAT POINT
THERE WAS STILL
KIND OF THAT TIMOTHY LEARY
APPROACH TO PSYCHEDELICS
GOING AROUND,
WHERE IT'S THIS
VERY PIOUS THING.
YOU SAT ON A PERSIAN RUG
AND LISTENED TO INDIAN MUSIC.
THERE HAD BEEN
VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY
OF ACTUALLY DEALING
WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN
YOU'RE STONED ON PSYCHEDELICS,
YOU'RE OFTEN JUST
WAY OUT OF CONTROL
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA
HANDLE THINGS.
AND HUNTER MADE THAT
HIS REAL TOPIC.
Depp:
"WHAT LEARY
TOOK DOWN WITH HIM
WAS THE CENTRAL ILLUSION
OF A WHOLE LIFESTYLE
THAT HE HELPED CREATE--
A GENERATION
OF PERMANENT CRIPPLES,
FAILED SEEKERS,
WHO NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THE ESSENTIAL
OLD-MYSTIC FALLACY
OF THE ACID CULTURE:
THE DESPERATE
ASSUMPTION THAT SOMEBODY
OR AT LEAST SOME FORCE
IS TENDING THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL."
Woman: I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M
STARTING TO FEEL THAT DRINK.
- PEANUTS, MAN.
- OH, GOD! OH, GOD.
TWO CUBA LIBRES
WITH BEER AND MESCAL
ON THE SIDE.
Duke's voice:
TERRIBLE THINGS WERE
HAPPENING ALL AROUND US.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO WALK IN THIS MUCK--
NO FOOTING AT ALL.
Perry: AT LAST
THERE WAS A VOCABULARY FOR
TALKING ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS,
AND IT WAS
ALSO AN EARLY CLUE
TO THE NEW DIRECTION--
MORE AND MORE
CRAZINESS FROM HUNTER.
OF COURSE, HE WAS HIGH ANYWAY.
I NEVER SAW
THE GUY WITHOUT
EITHER A CAN OF BUD
OR A BOTTLE
OF WILD TURKEY
IN HIS HAND.
HE DRANK A BOTTLE
OF BOURBON A DAY,
AND THAT WAS ON TOP
OF ALL THE PILLS
HE WAS TAKING,
SO HE WAS JUST
CONSTANTLY PUSHING
THE LIMIT OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
( reptiles roaring )
Duke's voice:
I WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FUCKING REPTILE ZOO
AND SOMEBODY WAS
GIVING BOOZE TO THESE
GODDAMN THINGS.
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW
BEFORE THEY TEAR US
TO SHREDS!
( roars )
( yells )
PLEASE!
TELL ME ABOUT
THE FUCKING GOLF SHOES!
All: HUH?
THE REJECTION
BY "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
INFURIATED HIM.
AND IT WAS ONLY
AT THAT POINT THAT
HE STARTED REALIZING,
LIKE, "EUREKA!
CHICAGO MAY NOT BE
WHERE THE DEATH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS.
IT'S LAS VEGAS."
( Hunter vocalizes )
* OOH YES!
( vocalizes )
* OOH YES!
* THESE LONG STRANGE NIGHTS
* THESE LONG
STRANGE NIGHTS... *
Wenner:
HUNTER HAD RENTED A CADILLAC
AND WANTED ME TO PAY FOR IT.
I SAID, "NO," YOU KNOW?
"I'M NOT PAYING FOR THE
RENT OF A CADILLAC."
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"WELL, I CAN'T COVER
THE GODDAMN AMERICAN DREAM
IN A VOLKSWAGEN.
WHAT THE FUCK IS
WRONG WITH YOU?"
AND UM...
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE
THAT'S QUITE TRUE.
( Steadman vocalizes )
* DRIVE YOUR STAKE
* THROUGH
A DARKENED HEART *
* IN A RED
MERCEDES BENZ... *
Depp:
"BREAKDOWN
ON PARADISE BLVD."
"AT THIS POINT
IN THE CHRONOLOGY,
DR. DUKE APPEARS TO HAVE
BROKEN DOWN COMPLETELY.
THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT
IS SO SPLINTERED
THAT WE WERE FORCED
TO SEEK OUT THE ORIGINAL
TAPE RECORDING
AND TRANSCRIBE IT
VERBATIM."
Hunter:
TESTING-- ONE, TWO.
CLOSING.
OKAY, IT IS NOW 11:30 A.M.
Depp:
"THE TRANSCRIPTION
BEGINS SOMEWHERE
ON THE NORTHEAST OUTSKIRTS
OF LAS VEGAS--
ZOOMING ALONG PARADISE ROAD
IN THE WHITE WHALE."
( Hunter speaking )
( Acosta speaking )
( Hunter speaking )
( Acosta speaking )
( Hunter speaks )
- HELLO.
- MAY I HELP YOU?
- YEAH.YOU HAVE
TACOS HERE?
- MM-HMM.
BUT THEY'RE FIVE
FOR A DOLLAR?
I'LL TAKE
FIVE OF THEM.
DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING TO DRINK?
BEER.NO, I HAVE
BEER IN THE CAR--
TONS OF IT--
THE WHOLE BACK SEAT'S
LOADED WITH IT.
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM.
WE WERE TOLD THAT
IT WAS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS AREA, BUT--
- THE AMERICAN DREAM?
- YEAH, THE AMERICAN DREAM.
- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING--
GO TO PARADISE.
- IS THAT IT?
WE'RE HERE LOOKING FOR
IT BECAUSE THEY SENT
US OUT HERE,
ALL THE WAY
FROM SAN FRANCISCO,
TO LOOK FOR IT.
THAT'S WHY THEY GAVE US
THAT WHITE CADILLAC.
THEY FIGURED THAT
WE COULD CATCH UP
WITH IT IN THAT.
HEY, LUKE,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS?
Acosta:
SHE'S ASKING HIM.
- WHAT IS IT?
- THAT'S WHAT
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE WERE SENT OUT HERE
FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOOK
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM.
NOW ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?!
BECAUSE--
Acosta:
NO, LOOK AT THE CAR.
I MEAN, DO I LOOK LIKE--
COULD THAT BE
THE OLD PSYCHIATRISTS' CLUB?
IT WAS A DISCOTHEQUE PLACE.
ALL WE WERE TOLD WAS,
"GO TILL YOU FIND
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
TAKE THIS WHITE CADILLAC
AND GO FIND
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN THE LAS VEGAS AREA."
ARE YOU TAKING
PICTURES OF IT OR--
- NO NO NO, PICTURES, JUST--
- SOMEBODY JUST SENT YOU
ON A GOOSE CHASE.
IT'S SORT OF
A WILD GOOSE CHASE
MORE OR LESS, YEAH.
Woman:
IT HAS TO BE
THE OLD PSYCHIATRISTS'.
BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO HANG OUT THERE
IS A BUNCH
OF PUSHERS, PEDDLERS,
- UPPERS-AND-DOWNERS
AND ALL THAT STUFF.
- MAYBE THAT'S IT.
- DOPERS.
- COULD BE IT.
I THINK THIS PLACE,
THE WAY YOU'RE
DESCRIBING IT--
I THINK-- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

Wenner:
HUNTER SAID, YOU KNOW,
VEGAS IS THE CITY
THAT WAS THE DEATH
OF WHAT HE THOUGHT
WAS THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IN THAT FAMOUS SCENE,
HE SEES THAT OPPORTUNITY
AND POSSIBILITY THAT WAS
REPRESENTED BY THE '60s.
"THE WAVE ROLLS BACK
AND," HE SAID, "ONCE FOR
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT THERE,
- WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT."
- * IT FEELS THE WAY
WE DIE... *
Duke's voice:
SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE '60s
WAS A VERY SPECIAL TIME
AND PLACE TO BE A PART OF,
BUT NO EXPLANATION,
NO MIX OF WORDS
OR MUSIC OR MEMORIES
CAN TOUCH THAT SENSE
OF KNOWING THAT YOU
WERE THERE
AND ALIVE IN THAT CORNER
OF TIME IN THE WORLD,
WHATEVER IT MEANT.
* AND YOU MAY NOT
KNOW WHY... *
Duke's voice:
THERE WAS MADNESS IN
ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR.
YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE.
THERE WAS A FANTASTIC
UNIVERSAL SENSE
THAT WHATEVER
WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
THAT WE WERE WINNING.
AND THAT, I THINK,
WAS THE HANDLE...
I have seen... the promised land.
I may not get there with you...
Duke's voice:
...THAT SENSE OF
INEVITABLE VICTORY
OVER THE FORCES
OF OLD AND EVIL.
NOT IN ANY MEAN
OR MILITARY SENSE;
WE DIDN'T NEED THAT.
OUR ENERGY
WOULD SIMPLY PREVAIL.
WE HAD
ALL THE MOMENTUM.
WE WERE RIDING
THE CREST OF A HIGH
AND BEAUTIFUL WAVE.
We, as a people,
will get to the promised land!
Duke's voice:
SO NOW, LESS THAN
FIVE YEARS LATER,
YOU CAN GO UP
ON A STEEP HILL
IN LAS VEGAS
AND LOOK WEST
