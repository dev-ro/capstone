Okay, are you ready?
I guess.
And speeding.
What's that?
- I want to start with some questions.
- Oh, got it.
Is it hard for you?
Has it been hard for you since...
Not in the way that I think you
would think it would be, but...
Uh, it's pretty much common knowledge that it
takes at least 20 shells to have a community.
That that's about the minimum
that you need to survive, so...
I think at first I was thinking
we're not gonna make it.
But sometimes you just have to disregard those
rules and think, "Well, actually, the rule is
that I want to be having a good
life and stay alive", and...
And not just survive, but have a good life.
Tell me about what's life like now?
It... Me? Uh...
I appreciate its different beauties, but
it... it's not the way I would've done things
if I was still in the group.
But they're not here.
So, that's why I have the electric mixer.
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.
Ta-da!
I mean, I don't want my voice in it.
Well, that's up to you.
So, stop asking me questions is what I'm saying.
Oh, okay. Do your parents
work? Have you ever met a chef?
What happens if you break this?
Have you ever eaten a raspberry?
Um, and what was that like?
Are you gonna ask me questions?
Hello?
Oh, man, this is weird.
I don't want my voice in it. How
am I supposed to ask you questions?
There are actually only two of us now.
Myself...
and my grandmother, Nana Connie.
Back when the man and the woman
lived here, there were a lot of us.
More sounds and smells and, uh, things to say
'cause there were more people to talk to.
There... A stage. All right!
Ah! Up.
These days, it's quieter.
Rolling. Give me some levels.
Give... Give you some levels? Like...
- Just, like, talk a little bit.
- Like, oh, uh...
Hello, my name is...
Darn it.
It's not the first time
I've done that.
My name is Marcel, and I'm partially
a shell as you can see on my body,
but I also have shoes, and, um, a face.
So, I like that about myself, and I like myself,
and I have a lot of other
great qualities as well.
- That was perfect.
- Okay.
Is this the wild tone right now?
- Yes.
- Ugh.
Just stay still for 30 seconds.
How long you gonna... What are
you trying to do with all this?
I'm making, like, a little
documentary that I might put online.
- Online?
- Yeah.
Eh, you lost me.
Ugh.
- Are you okay?
- Itchy. Are you recording?
- Yeah.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
Well, what should I be doing?
Just, well, don't do anything.
Just do whatever you'd normally
be doing, like if I weren't here.
Where'd you get the rope?
This? Uh, It... I... I'll show you.
I come to the bathroom,
I get these curly hairs.
They're the strongest
'cause you have to uncurl it,
but, um, then you can see
it's really long and strong.
But...
Hey, what are you laughing at?
We call 'em hardy hairs.
(LAUGHTER)
This is the arboretum, a collection
of trees that a community keeps alive,
but I do like to talk to
them, and plants like to have..
classical music played for them.
Mozart and Brahms, it helps them grow faster.
This is my bread room.
Uh, it's a bedroom,
but I sleep on a piece of bread, so I...
Whoa, sorry. He's just saying hi.
I actually like the concept of having a dog.
Oh, God, I can smell his face.
But I just tie a hair to a piece
of lint, and I drag it around.
I love you. Come on. Come on. That's it.
Sometimes, people say that my
head is too big for my body.
And then I say, "Compared to what?"
Sometimes, if I don't
have a way to itch my itch,
the only thing I can do is I just stand there.
I just let it get me and I just...
I just have to scream it out.
(SCREAMING)
He's your best friend?
Don't you know any other guys or...
Cool.
Hmm. I never get it the first time.
Nope.
Oh, dang it.
Oh! Go, go, go!
Boom! There it is.
You miss a 100% of the shots you don't take.
- Wow.
- That's a quote. I didn't make that up.
It's by a famous sports player
named Wayde...
Wayde Gansdy...
- What is it?
- Ways...
Way... Whale...
Whale Gensky.
- Are you thinking of Wayne...
- Gensky. Whale...
- Wayne...
- Could that be his name?
Whale Jetski?
- No.
- No?
- Wake... Lake... Jake?
- Well...
Wayne Jet... Jet... Get...
This is my stockpile.
All right, so, we got your basics here.
I got couple of almonds. I have a dozen peanuts.
It's basically your dry goods.
You got a craisin with the raisins,
but the craisin sits to the
side because it is a treat. Uh...
Is... Is this an inhaler?
It's like... It's like a slide or something...
Like, I don't even actually
know what it this is.
Where did you get that from?
From one of the people that
stayed here for a night.
- Why?
- Did you take anything from me?
What is wrong with you?
I didn't know.
- Give me that.
- I didn't know what it was.
So, these are all the parts put together.
- Mmm-hmm. - And
then now what?
- I'm gonna put it on the Internet,
and people can watch it. - Oh.
Oh, no.
Your soda can is almost empty.
(BARKING)
Whoa.
Sorry.
Hold on one second.
All right.
I don't know why you would... What...
What is cleaning the house if all
she does is move things around,.
and disturb the entire environment?
She doesn't.
She's doing dishes right now.
She's the harbinger of the vacuum.
I can't tell her to go home. I
mean, that's her scheduled cleaning.
- But why?
- She was hired
by the lady that is, like, the Airbnb host.
- What? The...
- Airbnb?
- Mmm, what is Airbb?
- To clean.
Oh, that's you! Oh, who's she?
Oh... I don't...
Oh, wow, wait, what?
- That's outside of here.
- Yeah.
Somehow, this has kind of turned
into like a computer hotel?
- Sort of, yeah.
- Why did you decide...
Why are you here?
I had to move out of my old place, so
I'm staying here until I find a new one.
Why did you have to move out?
Uh, that's personal.
Okay.
You never talked to anyone
who stayed here before?
People don't usually notice us.
Aw, dang it. I got to go check on Nana Connie
if this lady's gonna be running the vacuum.
This is the rover. Ow!
It's a good thing I don't, like, "care"
care about this car because I can't
figure out where I'm going in this thing.
Oops, what was that? Sorry.
(BARKING)
- No, no, no. Arthur.
- Hopefully, she's right around the corner here.
And there she is.
That's a load off. Can you
just wait here for one sec
because I do think that
with you and with the camera,
- it's just I... That I...
- Okay.
- I just want to warn her. Yeah.
- Okay.
Brown head-hair, and he has glasses.
- You want me to leave?
- No, no, no, no, no! I want you
to stay is what I...
- Yeah.
- Just careful where you step.
Yeah, I know.
- I just brought him by.
- You're making what?
A documentary.
- It's like...
- Oh, it's like a movie,
but nobody has any lines, and
nobody even knows what it is
while they're making it.
No?
That's sort of a way to put it, yeah. No,
I just am making a little video portrait.
- About Marcel?
- Yeah.
- A Docu... A film?
- Uh, yeah.
It's like the truth, kind of. It's a...
And it's the truth about Marcel?
I mean, I hope so. I guess
he could really spin it,
and make me look like a total...
So, this is your garden out here, huh?
- Yes.
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the aromas.
My house was very popular.
I had lots of friends.
And if you told me then, many years ago,
that I would've spent so much time in a garden,
I would've said, "Are you kidding?"
Okay, you see these ones?
You can feel them.
They're not quite ripe, but
in a few days, they would be.
It wasn't easy.
I didn't know anything about farming.
Because when the couple still
lived here, there was always food.
In the pantry, in the kitchen,
there were stacks here and there.
But when they went away..
the food disappeared.
So, I had to taught myself how to farm.
"Planting, harvesting... "
She's always been a pretty tough cookie.
Everything has a function with her.
There's no one button
that's there for decoration.
- You know what I mean?
- Mmm-hmm.
She's just like a backhoe.
But I will say you can
really see her tender side
when she's working with the bugs.
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's okay,
she's a little loopy.
She had a little bit too much, uh, nectar.
Vino Fiore, right, Franny?
My community found the bugs
to be deeply unlikeable.
Okay, we'll put her here in the sun.
And in a few seconds, she'll be dry.
But Connie's made friends with many of them,
and in return, they actually
help her with the gardening.
at first, found them a little
yucky but now I see their beauty.
- I cannot stand this thing.
- Because they turn the soil,
they break it...
It's wonderful to have them.
His whole body looks like his pants are off.
It reminds me of Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act,
how she helps them to do graffiti in
a meaningful way or something, and...
Oh, there she goes.
- Oops!
- Ow, ow, ow.
She's gone.
Uh, sort of.
Oh, wow.
What is, uh... What is this?
- Hmm?
- What's that?
What are you doing now with Marcel?
Oh, I'm making a movie.
A documentary.
- About Marcel?
- Yeah.
A documentary? Uh, a film?
Yeah.
- Ah, Marcel.
- You remember, Nan,
we were just talking about it.
It's a movie,
and we're doing it together, but...
- what I just said before.
- That's what you...
And we just joked about it.
- Yes.
- It's the truth,
but it's the truth about me...
(PHONE RINGING)
She has lost a small piece...
of a very large puzzle.
Nan!
Nana!
Once or twice a week, I'll find her in here,
snoozing in the laundry basket and...
Is it bad for her to be in here?
Yeah, it's not the safest place to be.
You know, my cousin fell asleep in a pocket,
and that's why I don't like the saying,
"Everything comes out in the wash,"
because sometimes it doesn't.
Or sometimes it does, and they're just
like a completely different person.
'Cause after that, my cousin
would just sit by the window
and wait for fire trucks to go by.
Guess what I use to tie my skis to my car.
- What?
- A hair.
Guess what my...
Guess... Guess what my skis are.
- What?
- Toe nails from a man.
Wait, hold on. So, you're telling me that
84 different people have just watched?
- Yeah, isn't that cool?
- Yeah. I mean... Geez.
What?
Just... Wow.
What do you do when you get bored?
Uh, I move around.
~ You really gotta move, move it
~ You really gotta groove it
~ Taking that time to let yourself
~ Lose it ~
I could tell he's performing
a little bit for you, you know?
Da, da, da, da. You're giving him a stage.
- It's good for him.
- One, two...
~ Mmm I want to linger
~ Mmm, a little longer
~ Mmm, a little longer here with you...
The stage makes him feel good.
Playful. He needs that.
~ Mmm, and as the years go by
~ Mmm, I'll think of you and sigh
~ Mmm, that it's so long and not goodbye ~
He hasn't been able to get that
since the others were taken from us.
Okay, so do you just want
me to start at the beginning?
I don't actually know how it started,
but the man and the woman started to yell
at each other more often than they
would talk to each other.
You know, you'd just hear
these big noises from the sky,
and my cousin's house fell down this one
time when the office door got slammed.
We started to have a shelter plan.
We all go to the sock drawer, and
so everyone will be safe there.
This was a Sunday,
and everybody gets together,
and we all watch 60 Minutes as a community.
- 60 Minutes, the...
- Yeah. So, this is where we were...
- And...
- Every week, all of you?
Yeah. We love it.
We just call it "The show. "
That's how much we love it.
Lesley.
- Who's Lesley?
- Lesley Show.
She likes Lesley Stahl.
- I'm Lesley Stahl...
- She blows cases wide open,
and she's got class.
.. on 60 Minutes.
But...
We could tell that something was the
matter because the clock started ticking...
...and it was just the two of us there.
It was a big one.
And we had...
We had no warning.
What we think is that everybody
scooted into the sock drawer, and, uh...
And the man just...
dumped all the drawers into a suitcase.
And then he left.
And that's... That's how they got moved.
I... Oh...
Do you want a tissue?
Yeah.
Do you mind if I just plop into it real quick?
Sure.
Shoot.
- This can be our last thing.
- Okay.
It's always what they say on the days
when you have a really keen sense
of being lost or losing something,
that it...
It often feels like the
sun shines the brightest.
And then the next day, there was a
really sunny day with a good breeze.
And I just remember thinking,
"if I was somebody else,
"I would really be
enjoying this. "
Whoa! Geez.
Okay, here it is.
So, tell me a little bit
about who you put on here.
I put, first and foremost, my
parents, Catherine and Mario,
next to each other with a heart.
My brother is here and here...
and I put my music teacher, The Maestro.
- Wow!
- Yeah!
I love that one, it sounds like Taps.
Do you know that?
Yeah. Do you want to hear Taps?
Sure.
(MUSIC)
Do you feel angry?
Uh, I just feel angry that we
didn't have a better goodbye.
Who would you say goodbye to?
I'd like to say goodbye to
my neighbors, the Costas.
Goodbye, the Costas, even
though we had a language barrier.
You were my neighbors.
You always liked to garden.
Goodbye, Richard, you were
the worst singer in our class,
but I loved how you let me cut you in line.
Goodbye, Anka,
your sense of timing is one of the worst.
Bye, Sandra, you were my favorite author.
Goodbye, Mrs. Kim.
The time that you ate a pepper flake and it
made you fly into the wall was one of the
funniest yet most serious accidents
any of us ever witnessed,
and you bore it with great grace and bravery.
Goodbye, Brad.
Thank you so much for rolling
that marble into my bread room.
I still keep it to this day.
Yep. And that... And there they all are.
- Guess why I smile a lot.
- Why?
Uh, 'cause it's worth it.
Um... Uh, whatcha doing?
Looking for apartments.
So, do you have any plans tonight?
No.
I'm gonna...
- Give me that.
- No! No!
Whoa. Marcel, look at this.
It... Aren't I... Wait. Is this normal for you?
No, this never happens.
- It's so cool.
- 22 million?
It's wonderful.
Yeah, it's, uh, broad...
Broad spectrum of emotions.
I didn't even know there were that many people.
Okay, now jump really hard.
Have you guys seen Marcel the Shell?
It's a YouTube video.
My name is Marcel, and I'm partially a shell.
My name is Marcel, and I'm a shell
as you can see on my body, but...
Oh, so nice.
...as a beanbag?
A raisin.
The wildly popular online character,
Marcel the Shell With Shoes On...
- Marcel...
- Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.
"When the kush hit... "
"Kush"? What is kush?
I... It goes so deep, and...
_ They got tattoos.
- It's just so many people, I...
I kind of regret this tattoo.
Here it is.
It's like a snail.
Um, I just saw it online, but it
was like super puffy the day after,
and I don't know why, and the
tattoo guy couldn't say why.
And then,
a couple of months later,
I found out that I...
Today, I'm going to be popping popcorn with
a magnifying glass. So right now we have...
There's all these people, and... And
we're all looking at the same thing,
and we're all doing the same thing.
We're watching the guys...
It's beautiful. And... And it feels like...
I don't even know how to describe
it. It feels like something.
Move, move, move!
It's really lovely.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes. I'm okay. I'm okay.
So, are you going to eat it?
You can eat this stuff?
- Yeah, dude!
- What does it taste like?
Oh, my gosh, you're gonna love it.
So good, isn't it?
It's all been really fun, and
having all this happen, and...
And, uh...
You know, it's so big feeling, and it's so nice.
Um...
Let it go! Let it go!
The other part of it is I think I find
my mind wandering a bit just thinking,
what would my family think,
and really noticing that they're
not here to share it with me.
I do wonder what...
What my dad would say,
what my mom would say, and, yeah...
I think they'd like it a lot.
Oh! There she goes.
Oh, beautiful.
There must be so many others like me.
It's impossible that there
wouldn't be, and not just my family.
They're out there.
Somewhere out there.
Every time I do this, that
dog goes totally crazy.
He sees something truly elegant in
the sky, and this is his reaction?
What a sad type of idiot.
"How to find your family"
Wow, this is...
Well, yeah, I don't think
that's gonna yield much.
No. Right, but...
- Probably.
- You know...
What's the matter?
Do you think they could be out there?
Uh, I mean...
Maybe.
All right, I think that's it.
We are live streaming.
And do I look at you, or should
I look right into the thing?
Me. Quick, uh, no, the camera.
It's gonna take a picture. Okay, well...
Hi, everybody. It's Marcel from before,
and I'm recording this video
because I'm looking for my family.
They were last seen with this man.
His name is Mark.
They disappeared from the house
owned by a woman named Larissa.
Here it is.
Airbnb link here.
What we do is manage properties that
are on the short-term rental market,
so if somebody's out of town for a long time
- and just wants to rent a
place for a while, we do that.
- So would you give me her number?
If there's a problem with the
property, I can send someone out,
but I can't give you any personal information.
Hey, have you ever eaten a raspberry?
Hello?
Darn it.
Just go for it.
This is what they look like. Uh,
right here, and here and here.
Um, I made this just to give you a
sense of who to be on the lookout for.
Sorry. I think I need a little help here.
- Dean?
- Hmm?
- Oh, Dean, come on.
- Because of what you're doing.
- It's exciting. It's a good scene.
- You could... You could still film it.
You can just put the thingy on the thing.
How would you do it if I wasn't here?
There's a lot of times where I
just don't get stuff that I need.
You are here. That's actually
what the truth of it is.
Yeah, but I don't want to be in it.
That's, like, defeats the whole point of this.
You know, Dean, have you ever thought that...
your life might be a bit less
lonely and a bit more integrated
if you took the time to connect with somebody
and not just make videos about them?
Thank you.
And lastly, this picture here shows
the car that Mark drove away in.
It is a teal Mishibibi.
- Mitsubishi.
- Mitsi-ibitsy.
- And...
- Mitsubishi.
- What is it?
- Mitsubishi.
Mitsubatbitsubisy.
Please leave any tips or any helpful
comments in the section below.
Thank you. Have a great day.
Update, guys, I think we found it.
It's Marcel's house. It's Marcel Shell's house.
Do you think you can get in there right now?
- Oh, someone's coming.
We got to go. Follow for more
celebrity homes. - Just keep going.
Huh.
Are they...
Are they here to help?
Mmm...
Uh...
Don't feel that this is the
task force I was hoping for.
There's so much nothing.
"She's the best. "
"She"? What?
But my dad has pink shoes.
So did my grandfather.
So cute.
This video touches me! What a cutie pie!
It's truly a great day for everyone!
Peace. Uh, yeah. Obviously peace.
Like...
What a weird thing to try to test
to see if someone else is into.
Like, of course I'm into peace.
No, sorry, I'm a real war person.
No, war actually.
I sign all my personal letters, "war. "
"Let the battle begin. Marcel. "
Ugh!
You know, there's... There is
nothing in here about finding them.
It's still a group of people,
but it's an audience. It's not...
It's not a community. There's...
Man.
Oh! What about the car?
What do you mean?
Mark drove away in a teal car.
So we can go look for it.
Like, if we find the car...
Yeah, I don't think that's like...
That's not the way to...
Wow! Okay, so it actually
doesn't even seem that big.
I mean, it's big but what we
just need to do is get up high,
and then maybe
we'll be able to spot his car.
- Mmm...
- What's, like, your mantel?
Like, when I need to look
out over the whole rug,
I get up high. I get up on the mantel.
Do you see what I'm saying?
'Cause I can see...
- Yeah, no, I got it.
- Yeah.
Great, so we'll just head up to the top of
this thing, and then we'll be able to see it.
- I don't think we'll necessarily
be able to see it. - I actually disagree.
I don't think it's a good idea because if
we're... if we don't have, like, a plan,
then we're just, sort of, flying blind.
And we might just waste a lot of time
- going around in circles. What's that for?
- It's just in case we get in a fight.
We're not gonna get in any fights.
You said it was dangerous out there.
- It's dangerous in a different way, so...
- And you know what else?
I should probably bring this match.
- You don't need that.
- Uh, just give me one more minute.
I need some sort of a helmet.
All right, so you've got the book.
You've got a little bit of a raisin, which
I really don't think you're gonna finish,
but you can go to town. Go to town.
Also, you have two drips of...
Look over here.
You have two drips of water.
You got an LED flashlight
in case the power goes out.
You just got to step on it like this. See?
See how it... Whoa. Sorry. But
don't stand right in front of it.
Finally, this is the sparkler.
What you do is you light this end
on fire, and then you step back.
This can act as a flare, all right?
- Why would I need it?
- That's if you need to signal for help.
And Dean's gonna leave
you his phone just in case.
- What? No, I'm not.
- Who will see the flare?
You know what? Now that I'm thinking about it,
why don't we just put the
colander over you now if you want?
All right, how's that?
You must let me out of here.
Do you want Alan in there with...
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not a big deal. It's tiny.
I think I'm okay.
God, I am so sorry.
Oh, my God.
How many times a day do
you throw up in your car?
There's a car. That... That's a teal,
but, uh, but that's more like, mmm...
I've never seen a lake except for in a picture.
Let's do it.
Uh, I think I'm gonna cry.
It's very beautiful.
There's fountains in the lake.
And another car. And a car. And a car. And a...
There's a lot of places to get tattoos.
"Psychic love expert. " Wow, I bet... Wow.
I could use one of those.
What would you want her to say?
Uh, I don't know.
There's more fish in the sea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, you got a lot of
smoocheroonies in your future.
- I can see it now.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, yeah.
Ooh, baby, baby.
Ooh, baby.
I've seen people kiss on television.
I'm so sorry.
- Up here, yeah?
- Oh! Is it? Oh, this is it!
- This is it.
- Let's check it out.
Whoa, we're really going up. Up,
up, up. This is gonna get high.
Wow.
What are all the little dots on the hills?
Those are houses.
All?
Yeah. Those are houses like yours.
Really?
What's all that?
That's the rest of the city.
Oh, right. Right, right.
I...
I had no idea.
Is this all there is for out there?
Mmm-mmm.
This is like one part of one big city.
And the... But, uh...
But there are many big cities.
There's lots of them. I mean,
you've seen, like, you know,
in movies and when it says, like, "Tokyo" and...
- Uh-huh... - "Antarctica,"
those are all different places.
Oh. Right.
There's so many places that they could be.
Do you think it's impossible?
I don't think it's impossible.
I think that's just, uh...
- Look at that lady's dress.
- I know. It's really nice.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was fun.
Oh. Look at this.
They're right on the...
They're on the lawn.
- They came right up.
- Stop it!
You wouldn't get it.
Hey, guys. Guys.
I wanna be first.
Hey. Stop it!
No, no.
Would you mind just moving a little
bit so we can pull the car in?
Arthur.
Nan! Nan!
Nan!
- Nan!
- Yes.
Oh, my God. Nan, are you...
- I'm just hurt a little
- Oh, my God.
- ... but I'm okay.
- You are?
Please just... Just lean your whole self on me.
Put all your weight. Don't worry, I can take it.
And I guess... Okay.
Uh, let's just take it easy.
I'm really not sure exactly of what
happened because she won't tell me.
It could just be that she doesn't remember,
and I think that's probably the case.
Do you want me to stop?
But what I've been able to piece together
is that she did get startled,
then she fell off the dryer.
No! No! Arthur!
Sorry. Arthur, come here.
Arthur! Arthur! Come here.
He... He... He has got to go.
I cannot have him here with Connie like this.
It's not that I don't like Arthur.
_ Stop, Dean. I'm not kidding.
- Stop that.
No! Oh, my God!
- No! No. Off!
- Arthur! Arthur!
All right. A little bit more.
Okay.
What's he, uh...
What's he being charged with?
What?
Is he going to the jail?
- No.
- Oh. Oh, phew. 'Cause I'm sorry. I thought...
I'm going to take him to my wife's house.
Uh... You...
What?
Well, we got separated recently,
so that's why I'm staying here.
I've been looking for a new place.
That's why I'm here.
Why wouldn't you tell me this?
Uh, I don't know. I didn't think to.
Okay.
I told you so much. I...
- So...
- I'm making a movie about you.
I'm not making a movie about me.
But you're also here. And I was sharing.
You didn't also think to share?
- And then you're just
pointing that around. - No.
I do think about it.
It's not...
Why do you... Do you always need to be filming?
No.
I think you'll be glad I
have it, though. We have it.
Uh-huh.
Hold on.
Can we pause the videos that we made
so people can't see them, please?
Yeah, I can take 'em down.
I just can't have more people coming to the
house like... Like how it happened today.
I can't believe I let this happen.
Well, you know, she sleeps a lot.
And she hasn't been eating very much.
It's looking good.
You just gotta keep on moving.
You're just one more little...
Let me do...
I can do it.
She's just not able to do a lot of the
things that she used to be able to do.
- Yeah, that's...
- Hurts.
- Sorry, did you shut the window?
- Yes, I shut the window.
- Don't help me here. I don't need help.
- Nana, I'm not even doing anything.
Uh!
The skater rink, you know, is
usually just for the holidays.
- Want to try...
- How am I looking?
You need, uh, maybe once or twice more.
- Okay.
- But I set it up just to...
try to cheer her up a bit.
Pump it. Pump it up.
Come on, Nan.
Up.
All right!
Nana, pump it up.
No, no. No, no, I don't think so.
- Don't you wanna pump it up?
- No, no.
When I say "jam," you say "Nan. " Jam.
Well, she won't skate with
me anymore, that's for sure.
- Get into it, a little bit.
- Stop it.
But you know what? She...
She really does like the dust.
For her, it's special. She's not from here.
She's from the garage.
That's why she has the accent.
It's this wonderful smell.
She traveled here by coat pocket
when she was really little.
I just feel...
And so I think it reminds her of home.
Nan, look at this. Ready?
Oh!
Grandma Connie, we need to move!
Not that way. This way!
Get it out!
I'll get the rover!
- Did I hit it?
- Not coming over here? Come follow my voice.
- Your left or my left.
- Your left.
At this point, the good days
are harder to come by with her.
I mean, he's right here. He's on the couch.
Yeah, I'm looking right at him.
And then the bad days are
just actually astounding.
Oh! He can jump.
- There he... There he goes!
- Ah, all right,
I'm trying not to treat her any differently,
but it's, uh, keeping me on
my toes, I'll tell you that.
Wait, I'm gonna close this.
Wow, look at this.
I'm producer at CBS News 60 Minutes
in New York. I hear you're a fan of the show!
- You might be interested.
- Right?
Oh, my gosh.
I know.
With Lesley Stahl.
Oh, my gosh.
Ugh. This is a...
This is...
Oh, my God.
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Mmm, yeah, yeah.
It's really...
We can't show this
to Nana Connie.
Absolutely not.
I mean, I could ask them to keep the
crew really small, then they wouldn't make
- a big footprint.
- No. No, no, no.
Can I ask them how many people would come in?
- No.
- What?
I'm not taking the risk.
- There are a lot...
- What is the risk?
The risk? Look what already
happened to Nana Connie.
"We're wondering if you might be interested
"to discuss doing an interview
piece with Lesley Stahl. "
We can't do it, Nan.
The real Lesley?
- Yeah, it's the real Lesley.
- Don't do that.
"Please let me know if you're interested.
"We'd love to make it work. "
This recovery is not happening fast enough,
and now she has attitude, and I feel bad.
We'll just do it once she's feeling
better and moving around better.
How many of those do you take? Don't take a lot.
I'm not taking, 'cause I don't know how...
when I'm gonna get another one.
This is how I live.
just to find new ways of doing things
and learning how to survive on our own.
And I guess it's...
I don't wanna end up with
less... than what I have.
I can't make this decision for you, but...
No, you're not. I've
already made it for myself.
I said no.
He's no fun to be around, is he?
Do... Do you have any
corner pieces over there?
I want you to do it.
No. Nan, no. And we
already... We told them no.
But don't you want to meet Lesley Stahl?
We need quiet, Nana.
We don't need a lot of
people coming in here and...
You don't... You don't need quiet for me.
- I don't want quiet.
- Oh.
- Nope.
- I think you should do it.
You know, we're just
flying blind. I don't...
I don't even know what we're
supposed to be making here.
What is this even a picture of?
Do you have any blue pieces?
He seems... He's bound up, isn't he?
Mmm.
I think he's afraid of change.
Scary.
Especially after what we went through.
But life's not gonna go on unless...
if you don't.
If you don't open up, right?
Do you know that, Dean?
Heh, heh, heh.
Who among us hasn't wished...
we could read someone else's mind?
Know exactly what they're thinking.
- Well, that's impossible, of course...
- I want him to...
I want him to dive in life, you know?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm not gonna be here forever. Hmm.
You know what I mean?
Uh, yeah, I think he's
just worried that...
Maybe he'll feel... He'll sort of
lighten up when you're feeling better.
- Better?
- Yeah.
Feeling better.
Better. Better. Better. Hmm.
Tch. Better.
Connie? Nan?
Huh.
It's weird because I did
think I heard her up. Listen...
What the...
Nan.
- Are you..
- Look how fun this is. Look.
- You're just out here?
- Look, I had forgotten how fun...
- How long have you been out here?
- Look, I can...
- Oh!
- What is going on right...
Nan, you're really...
I have to work on my
aim, but look, look, look.
- Yeah, I see that.
- I've been trying to get it.
(SINGING)
I never understood the words,
but I could do it with...
- Yeah.
- I don't wanna get ahead of myself,
but she seems to suddenly
have a lot more energy.
Do you know what that is?
- It's the...
- They play that
- before the sports.
- Yeah, before sports.
It means the sports are starting.
What kind of sports do you watch?
They like running after
balls or squash them.
Kicking.
Put them over, like, a net
sometimes, they do that.
But the net is a hole,
so it comes right out.
Right, so it's just like,
why do you put it back in?
- It's really strange.
- I do notice,
I think, that she's
definitely been eating better.
Mmm. My favorite.
Nope, not for you.
Bup. Nan, you really...
Did you just eat that whole thing?
Oh, yes, of course. I love shish kebab.
- Wow.
- No, we're still friends.
Why did you divorce her? Was your wife...
She's great. We just grew apart.
- You okay?
- I'm totally fine.
- Are you sure?
- Maybe you should be resting or...
- Nan, maybe we'll think of...
- Who decided to leave?
- You or her?
- It was pretty mutual.
You don't fool me. It's never mutual.
And she's... she's got
some of her color back.
You're broken. You're
making this documentary to...
- Oh, my...
- So you don't have to think of her?
Is that why? 'Cause he's heartbroken.
Are you heartbroken, Dean?
He's laughing, so maybe
he's not so heartbroken.
Look at her. She's just completely
bounced back. It's like... Completely.
- 100%.
- Wow.
I hope I get that... those genes.
Because... I mean, that's
not part of the deal.
Do you want me to be happy?
- Yeah.
- Do the interview.
She got you there.
- All right. For you.
- I like you brave.
- Come on.
- Two...
Uh, six... Over to the left, yeah.
Eight.
And now just the green button.
Boom, baby.
You got this.
- CBS.
- Oh, uh... hello?
- Put it on speaker.
- Hello?
Hello, is this...
- Hello?
- Is this Shari?
- Yes, it is! Is this...
- Hi, Shari, uh, this is Marcel.
This is Dean. I'm also on the line.
Hi, nice to speak with you guys.
- Nice to speak with you.
- Um...
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I just said it was... That it's
also nice to speak with you as well.
- It's nice to talk to you, too.
- He was acting calm and collected,
and I knew he was, like,
the front, Mr. Serious Face, Mr. Cucumber,
- but inside, butterflies.
- Absolutely, yes.
Talk about your family and
your search to find them.
Sometimes we'll learn
something as we're shooting,
and that can lead to new discoveries.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And, uh, do you think it's...
It's a possibility that
something could, uh, come from...
Yeah, I mean, there's no promises,
but if you have information,
we'll see where...
Where our reporting leads.
Um, and, Dean, one other
thing I wanted to ask you is,
you know, I think it
might be really interesting
to interview you as part
of the story as well.
Is that something that
you're comfortable with?
Uh, I don't know. I mean, I'm
generally behind the camera.
Somebody doesn't wanna do it. Oh!
Uh, I'll get back to you
on it. How about that?
Hmm?
This is a little doorbell.
Good morning, Nan.
Nan?
Huh.
Just one second.
Good morning, Nan.
- Today's the day.
- Yes.
Oh, Nan.
Oh, no, I'm fine. I was just going to...
- Are you sure that's... Does it
hurt still or.. - No, adjusted.
Getting better already. Look, look.
All right.
I'm gonna grab you some water.
- Oh, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.
Got your water here.
Ice-cold, thirst-quenching water.
Who wants it? A water,
water, who wants a water?
- Thank you, Marcello.
- You're welcome.
Quite a day for Lesley Stahl.
There's definitely a storm rolling in.
I can feel it.
I can feel it because
my shell feels tight.
(CHATTERING)
Do I seem nervous?
- It's okay to be nervous.
- Ugh.
Let me get that.
Yeah, I guess.
Uh... I...
- Is that...
- What? What is it?
That's the shish kebab
from the other night.
Where is she? Do you know where she is?
Nana.
You took away my vote. You didn't ask me.
I can't believe you lied.
- You lied to me, Nan.
- You took my...
- You wrote me off.
- I did not write you off.
Did you ask me? No, you didn't.
So? You just said no to
60 Minutes, end of story.
I made a decision for your health
'cause I was worried about you.
Should I get the door?
- That's what I want.
- Well, I... I want that too,
- but this is...
- All I want...
- Nan.
- All I want
is for you to try.
- I want you...
- No...
- Nan...
- It's a big wide world.
I don't wanna lose everything
in the hope of something.
That's already gone.
You break my heart if you don't.
Hello?
You can tell 'em we need to cancel
- if you want to do that.
- Well, what's the option?
- Dean?
- Mmm-hmm?
Please, can you shut up?
- Marcello...
- Yes?
Let's forget about being afraid.
Uh... Is Lesley afraid?
Mmm, no, Lesley is fearless.
It may be good, it may be not,
but just take the adventure.
Don't use me as an
excuse not to live. Hmm?
But what if... What if
everything changes...
again?
- Marcello, oh...
- Yeah.
It will.
- Aw.
- Come here.
Okay, well... let's do it.
- Come on, go, go.
- Yeah.
- Hello. Come in!
- Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
It's good to finally meet you.
- You're Shari, I presume?
- You have a camera.
- Oh, I do have a camera.
- Okay, then.
Is that okay? Can I film while you guys
- are setting up?
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah? That's great.
- Whoa.
Those gentlemen were
not wearing bee-odorant.
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Did you see that?
- I did.
Just those boxes walking.
And then behind them, there were men.
Look at ponytail over here
looking around for the bathroom.
Trying to act like it's not an emergency.
It's over there!
What are you... What are you doing to him?
Now, I'm just sort of giving Marcel
a little bit of bronzer
just to kind of warm up.
- That tickles.
- I'm just gonna do a little bit here.
- Oh. Close... That's okay. Close your mouth.
- Sorry, I spit on you.
Hey, now look, now he's on TV.
Okay, but now he's back in real life.
This guy over here,
look. Real life, on TV.
Oh, look at that one. That's Toolbelt.
- And that one?
- That's just Mr. Headphones.
Do you wanna see what you look like?
- Oh, my God.
- Don't you look rested?
Yeah, I look like I,
like, only drink olive oil.
This guy over here, look.
Real life, on TV. Marcello, look.
- Good. How was your flight?
- It was okay.
- Yeah?
- You know, long.
All right, well, we have a fun day...
Nana, make the noise.
Tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-
tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik-tik...
All these stories and more
on 60 Minutes. 60
Minutes. Tik-tik, tik-tik.
Marcel, can I get you
to stand in real quick?
Oh, yes. Uh, Nan, uh, are you gonna be...
- Go, go. Yes, of course. Go.
- Okay.
- Go.
- Coming through.
I'll bring him right back.
- Yeah.
- Be right back.
Goodbye.
On real life,
on TV.
Wow, I think, uh... Yeah.
I think that's the brightest
thing I've ever seen.
I... I know that you like these
kind of things for your movie.
- It might... might be good.
- Mmm.
I found this the other day.
Mmm... Here it is.
It's about season changing.
This book... This book I
had for many, many years.
But I had not noticed
this... This part that
I would like to read you.
Please.
"The trees are coming into leaf
"Like something almost being said".
All right, guys, five to four minutes.
Four minutes, everybody.
"The recent buds relax and spread,
"Their greenness is a kind of grief".
Let's reset. Let's go to one, please.
"Is it that they are born again
"And we grow old? No, they die too".
Oh, hello. Hello. You are beautiful.
"Their yearly trick of looking new
"Is written down in rings of grain".
- Sound, please.
- Quiet on the set.
- And mark.
- Camera B marker.
And we're rolling. Rolling.
When you're ready.
"Yet still the unresting castles thresh
"In full grown thickness every May".
Not ready, no, I'll stay.
Well, if you insist.
"Last year is dead, they seem to say".
Slow down, come on.
- "Begin afresh".
- Wait for me. Wait for me.
"afresh, afresh".
- Shari, done?
- Yep.
We're done.
All right, everybody.
That's a wrap on Marcel!
I think they had to get to the outlet,
but we can get them to move it back.
Yeah, but if something
moved and nobody noticed
Nana Connie, she could
be behind something.
Nan?
I just... Sometimes she goes to the toilet
and sits on the rim.
Nan?
- You checked her room, yeah?
- No.
Yeah, do you want... I
mean, should we go over...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Next...
Hmm.
- I'm glad I got to meet her.
- Me, too.
She probably felt tired.
Especially after being very excited.
Have you ever done that before,
like, when there's a party in your house?
Sometimes it's easiest to rest
when you go off by yourself and you
can still hear the noise of the party,
and you feel safe knowing that
so many people are around...
- Yeah.
- that you can have a rest?
Mmm-hmm.
That's good. And now this one.
She was exactly what you
would want a grandmother to be.
She had a... A vibrant past,
and a colorful personality, and
she didn't get sanded down by life.
Hello!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Why're you in the tree?
- Sorry?
- That's my tree.
- This is yours?
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. It looked
like it was on hers.
Nope.
Well, do you mind if I
stay up here for a minute?
- I'm just... It's a short...
- I do mind.
I don't have insurance for
whatever you're doing up there.
Okay, coming down. Sorry.
- Okay.
- You fall,
something happens, I'm liable.
What is it that you're actually...
Is it... Not with a studio
- or, uh...
- No.
Whoa, all right.
Okay, and I made her look
like an everything bagel.
Perfect.
Ow, darn it.
It doesn't seem to... No, no.
No.
Nope.
I don't know what you want.
I can't help you. I don't know what it is,
and she's not here, so you gotta...
go.
Hey.
- How you doing?
- Mmm, good morning.
Can you teach me a song?
I... All I... I don't know...
~ I wanna linger
Will you do it?
Do you wanna do the mmm-mmms?
Sure.
(HUMMING)
~ I wanna linger
Well, you're really not
singing the note at all.
- You can't sing any notes.
- No, I can't. But how do I do it?
Well, I can't teach you how to sing.
You do it, and then I'll copy you.
(HUMMING)
No.
Okay, you...
~ I wanna linger
No.
I really don't know what to do with you.
I gotta say...
~ I wanna linger
~ A little longer
~ A little longer here with you
No, none of those are the right notes.
Do you like sitting halfway on a chair?
Uh, yeah, go home and think about it.
This is unbelievable.
What can I do to practice?
She just kept everything.
So, are...
So where you... You gonna go now?
What?
- Aren't you leaving?
- No.
- No?
- Oh. No, why would I do that?
Well, I guess 'cause
of the suitcase and...
- Oh, no. I'm just looking for my tie.
- Oh. Oh.
Where am I gonna go?
I don't know.
You're it, baby.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Dean. Hey, Marcel. This
is Shari from 60 Minutes.
Um, I wanted to let you know
that the interview went great.
We've been looking at the footage
and I'm wondering if you
would be willing to do
another day of shooting with us.
So, um, we've made some discoveries
that I'd love to share with you.
It's kinda all happening fast,
so if you could get back to me
as soon as you get this message,
I would really appreciate it.
Um, hope to talk to you soon. Bye.
2 MONTHS LATER
Good things come in small packages...
an old idea, but one you'll
see tonight in a new light.
In the only interview he's given
since becoming an Internet phenom,
Marcel the Shell shares
his unique perspective
on what we take for granted.
He adds new meanings to
the simplest of ideas.
Marcel, a 1 inch-tall shell,
reminds us of the true value of community,
the transformative power of friendship,
and the most ingenious
use for a tennis ball.
But if you wanna make sure
that your parking space
is, like, perfectly flat,
because otherwise, it's not
gonna be where you left it.
And... And I don't have the model...
For years, Marcel and
his grandmother Connie
shared this old house
with their pet lint, Alan,
and an ever-changing
array of human guests.
I just stay out of their way and...
And stay out of sight, and it worked.
But all that changed when an
amateur filmmaker moved in.
so kind of on all the
time. And so, I felt like
I could just roll and roll and roll.
Um, Dean, what were
your first impressions?
Uh, I guess I was impressed with his, um,
pizzazz...
- his spark, you know?
- Wow.
Uh, pfft.
No, I... I like it.
And maybe you needed...
Needed the connection,
needed the friendship.
Yeah, maybe you needed the friendship.
Marcel, how long has it been
since you've seen your family?
Well, I don't do the clock the
way that you guys do the clock.
- Right.
- Uh, but I think
I'm watching the changes in the trees and
the flowers that have bloomed
and the blossoms that have fallen.
The buds that have come and bloomed again.
So I... I couldn't tell you, but I, uh...
The space in my heart gets
bigger and louder every day.
- Mmm. Dean, do you know how long?
- It was two years.
- Two years.
- Yeah.
Oh, that's nice to know.
Given all the new information
Marcel shared with us...
and he had just, like
the same kind of man face,
like two eyes, that kind of thing.
A mouth and all the teeth.
we were able to track down Larissa Geller.
We found her here in the
highlands of Guatemala
working for an environmental NGO.
Geller then returned home
and helped us locate this man,
her former boyfriend, Mark Booth.
I don't even wanna do this. You're
really putting me in a tough spot here...
All right, I'll see you soon. come on.
- Okay, bye.
- This is ridiculous.
Wait, are you still...
After some brief introductions...
- This is Mark.
- Hey, sorry.
It's kind of messy. I'm just sort of...
- So I was cleaning earlier.
- Right.
- the search efforts began.
- I mean, I don't know. This is...
I don't even know where else to look.
I honestly don't know what
to do. I don't know the area.
This is definitely the bag.
So that... That is good news.
I'm not gonna get... I'm not
gonna start to feel down...
And then Marcel heard a familiar sound.
Yeah, and then you just came over...
What our crew heard was an argument.
You were on all of the emails...
But what Marcel heard...
was the sounding of an alarm.
- I'm a child?
- Yes.
Oh, dur, the sock drawer.
Did we check the sock drawer?
An alarm he knew would send
any shells into a shelter plan.
Geez, it's over here!
Hey, guys! Over here!
Over here, I need a boost.
Hey, I need to get to the
top. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Open the top drawers, somebody.
Be careful. Be very, very careful.
Open, open. Careful.
What followed was something we rarely see.
(CHATTERING)
A family reuniting.
~ I like the way sparkling earrings lay
~ Against your skin so brown
~ And I wanna sleep with
you in the desert tonight
~ With a million stars all around
~ 'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
~ And I know you won't let me down
Marcel was always a performer.
- He always wanted to, um...
- CATHERINE and MARIO parents
Always wanted to be on stage,
make people happy and smile.
- Mmm.
- And as his mother...
- Sorry.
- Oh, Mom.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I told you, you're gonna
get right into the real stuff.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Uh, well, we can do this
thing, pick it up later or...
Let's talk about something else.
Talk to Mario for a minute.
It's really hard. Do you see?
Mario.
Yeah. I'm... I'm sorry. I was
thinking about something else.
And that's us in a nutshell.
Yeah, I just... I just was being...
(CHATTERING)
~ Tells me I may never see you again
Most of the innovations Nan
and I came up with, you know,
they're just not necessary anymore.
Ho! One, two, three, ho!
All right, blue!
Then again, some of them
have really taken off.
~ 'Cause I'm already standing
~ Yes, I'm already standing
~ Yes, I'm already standing
~ On the ground
Okay. Thank you very much.
(CHEERING)
Look at you.
I missed your little face, Marcel.
I missed you so much. I
just want to squeeze you.
Um, I'm just moving on.
The beauty. More so, I
cried from the beauty.
Aw, Mr. Costas, you're making me blush.
Okay, but just put your
weight on the front foot...
- and then you unstick the back one.
- Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
I know. Right, but you
have to keep doing it.
I'm fine.
Well, all right, but do
you see what's happening?
- I know.
- Okay.
She is really good, especially
for such a little one.
But you know what it is?
She has that thing that's
like when you're young,
you have no fear 'cause you
haven't injured yourself yet,
and you don't even know what risk is.
You just zoom around all the time.
Marcel, I'm being patient.
- Okay. If you're trying to be patient...
- Marcel, come on.
Come out here with me,
and shake that little tush.
- Come on.
- I will.
I really promise I will
take a turn around the rink.
- I'm just kind of observing.
- Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean.
- Yeah?
- Please.
This is the stock that I come from.
- Dean.
- You can see a direct line
to Nana Connie with this one.
Could you tell your friend Marcel
I'm not gonna wait forever, please?
Wow.
It's nice to see you back with everyone.
Yeah.
You know, you're welcome
back here any time you want.
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.
You're welcome to my
house any time you want.
You don't have a house.
I will soon.
- I signed a lease.
- Pay attention.
- Each of you..
- Oh. Well, then, I accept.
One, two, three.
Come on, Marcel. Come on. Let's go.
- We're going ice skating.
- We're going on the ice skating rink.
Yeah, I saw you skating before.
It is different now after
living alone for so long.
I find that sometimes
being in a big group is...
This is what I wanna be
doing. I want to slide down.
Good. I didn't know
that that's what you were
trying to do. I thought
you were asking me how I...
can be overwhelming to me.
You guys, there's... I need to learn.
I needed somewhere that
I could come and just...
I found myself coming
down here more and more.
Such a lovely smell from the dryer sheets.
And I... I like it because
there's a window that is always
opened a little crack there.
I would stand there,
and sometimes I'd tell
her things, ask for advice,
or just let sounds come out of my mouth.
And one day, I was just sitting,
and the wind blew in,
and it blew just over the
top of my head in such a way.
And the wind blew over, and it
made a beautiful whistling sound.
- What kind of noise is it?
- Wait, shh, shh. Listen.
Can you hear it?
That's it. That's going through my shell.
It felt just like her
to lead me to a place
where I would experience
something new and special.
It connected me how I
felt like to everything,
because if I wasn't there,
the sound never would exist.
And I felt like everything was in pieces,
and then I stood there,
and suddenly, we were
one large instrument.
I like to go there a lot
because it reminds me
that I'm not just one separate piece
rattling around in this place,
but that I'm part of a whole.
And I truly enjoy the sound of myself
connected to everything.
I'm gonna let him out. Are you ready?
All right. Release the hounds!
Come on, do it. I'm actually
really excited to see him.
Here it comes.
Hi, bud! Oh, boo-boo. Come here, bubba.
How are you, pal?
- Aw, he remembers you!
- Ah! Ugh. Ew.
- Oh, you remember Marcel?
- Oh, you smell. Oh, my goodness.
He has a new smell. It's... Is he sick?
I switched him to wet food,
and it's made his breath go crazy.
It is a very dense, very rich aroma.
- Arthur!
- Wow.
So, you guys got wet dog food.
- Yeah.
- You got a balcony.
- Yeah, we got the cool view.
- That's nice.
I see you have some flowers here.
Oh, yeah. They're nice.
They're from, uh, a bike path.
There's a bike path that
goes in front of my place.
Uh-huh. Who gave you these flowers?
No one gave them to me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- I picked them myself.
Oh, really? 'Cause we had a garden
at our place. I never saw
you picking any flowers.
I wanted to make the place nice.
A friend was coming over.
- Ah, a friend.
- Yes, I had a friend.
What kind of a friend?
- She is a girl.
- Really?
Would you like to see
the rest of the apartment?
Would you like to change the subject?
Yes, I want to see it.
- Hop on.
- Oh, thanks.
All right, so, here's my room.
Oh! More flowers in here, huh?
Yeah, more flowers in here.
Hit... Hitting that bike path pretty hard.
Actually, those are
from the Farmer's Market.
