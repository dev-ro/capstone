They see us from the place that
we can't see them from.
You're in dream Tarýk. Wake up!
Wake up!
Till my soul is formed to stone.
My mask is cleaned from dirts.
The biggest loneliness, surround the earth,
become prettier with your judgement.
Dead one give life to your section.
Tell me who you are?
Doesn't he answer the phone Sema?
Uff he doesn't answer.
He had a job in internet.
Maybe he's still working on it.
It's bothered me not to
reach him for four days.
Well, I understand why he didn't come here.
But It's silly not to answer the phone.
Girl gosh! You're so weird.
He asked you to go
out. You didn't want.
Told him to stay as friends. Maybe not as
much as yours but man kind has proud too.
Of course he doesn't answer the phone.
But we call him from work.
How can he know it is Sema?
I don't want to talk so much but
Tarýk bought a new computer...
...at the same time Sema reject him.
I think he shut down himself at home
and give all his attention to computer.
He phoned me at midnight four days ago.
I was suprised. I asked him what happened?
After he waited for a moment in silence,
he said there was nothing and...
...shut down the phone.
I don't think Tarýk's behavior
is about you Sema.
Because he did the same thing to me.
Well, maybe you're surprised but a week
ago he called me and whispered...
...that I did'nt understand something.
Then he suddenly shut the phone.
I just know, he became weird
after he've moved to that house.
It's so silent at nights.
I've never stayed there
even they give me money.
Could he be at home right now?
Tarýk! Are you at home?
Tarýk!
Is something wrong?
It nearly finishes, miss.
Just a second!
It's open. Well, come in!
- Thank you.
- Thanks, have a nice day.
What had happened to that place?
What is all about?
Aah, Are you here?
God I'm scared so much. What
have you done to your house?
Sorry Hande, I didn't here you come.
You're okey, aren't you?
We could'n reach you and
worried about you.
Also why didn't you answer the phone?
I was working, I was busy.
Did you finish your
work on internet?
No, it didn't.
You've been working on four days and
nights. What sort of work is this?
What is it about?
Can you tell alittle?
Never mind!
Ah, I remember something, if your're done
with my digital camera, Can I take it?
It's finished, thank you. It's at
the drawer under the library.
Hey Tarýk! Do I open the
windows for fresh air?
God sake, what is all these mess
about? Newspapers, staffs...
If there's something
I can do, I'm free.
Do you know, Sema is
really worried about you.
She thinks, you don't
call us because of her.
I think, don't give up about Sema.
Do you understand what
I'm talking about? Tarýk!
Tarýk!
Tarýk!
Tarýk!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake uuuuuuuup!
Hello!
Hello, commander. I'm Haluk!
Good morning Haluk.
What happened?
It looks as if you have to come
earlier today. There's something.
Yesterday, a weird suicide happened.
Station want you to take care of this case.
Station, who?
Commander, Ankara called us.
Tarýk Poyraz. 23 years old. It looks
like he killed himself with a big...
...kitchen knife at home at 16.40 pm.
Pre-autopsy report tells us, there
isn't any violence or punch traces.
The fingerprints on
knife is only belong to him.
Anyhow he's known as
a normal and beloved guy.
He earned money, by playing
at stock exchange at internet.
Last few days, he turned to himself.
Mess in his room shows us he
has some psychological problems.
There's his friend Hande Çerkez at
home while he killed himself.
Both autopsy report and girl
tell same thing, it's suicide.
But the cause is unknown.
I'm sorry commander.
Why Ankara is so interested in that case?
We don't understand either.
They explained us, that kind of deaths
increases especially in Istanbul.
Never mind. The girl you
mentioned. What is her name?
Hande Çerkez. She is at the outside now.
Miss Çerkez, commander Süleyman Dervis
is high authorized person in that case.
He'll ask you some questions.
Your friend's case is absolutely suicide.
So there is no suspicion about murder.
From now on, any word you'll say help
to closed the case fast. That's all.
Miss Çerkez, please look at
my face, while I'm talking.
What do you think
your friend Suicide?
I don't know.
Do you know why people who
decide to suicide jump into sea?
Because they dream sea as a soft,
big pillow. Or a lovely mother chest.
They believe they don't feel any pain.
But the worst and the the most painful
death is to be drawn in the water.
I'm trying to tell, sometimes there
is deeper hints than cause in it.
Same as your friends case.
It didn't look like a
typical suicide, did it?
Miss Çerkez can you please look
at my face, while I'm talking.
What did happen inside
the house that day?
Tarýk, did you finish your
work on internet?
No, it didn't.
You've been working on four days
and nights. What sort of work is this?
What is it about?
Can you tell alittle?
Never mind!
Aah, I remember something, if your work is
finished can I take my digital camera?
It's finished, thank you.
It's at the drawer under the library.
Wake up!
Wake up now!
Wake up now!
Wake up now!
Wake up now!
Wake up now!
Wake up now!
Wake up now!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake uuuuuuup!
You're at dream Tarýk. Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake uuuuuuuuup!
Hande what happened?
I saw Tarýk in my dream.
What causes to kill himself
such a bad way?
I think we aren't guilty. Suicide
don't happen just like that.
It's a kind of showing manifest
of many years secrets and pains.
We believe we've
known him. But it isn't...
Last week he told me that
he wanted to go far east.
He's so normal.
You know, sometimes you're lost in
thoughts, he even haven't done it.
Actually, last days that internet
work make him darker.
I always warned him;
"Stand up, get fresh air".
What are polices thinking?
What did you tell them?
Miss Çerkez can you please look
at my face, while I'm talking.
What did happen inside
the house that day?
He talked to me in normal
way. Just looked so tired.
As you know, all walls are covered
with black bands and newspapers.
When he came near me,
first he opened the drawer.
He took something.
Then, went to his room.
I asked him the digital camera that
I've given him and he told me.
After I took my camera I heard he was
awfully screaming as "Wake uppppppp!"
Then...
I know then what has happened.
Well, I'll ask you one last question.
This question is so important.
I understand that, Tarýk was so interested
in computers and internet world.
Does he have connection with
new religions and tariqas...
...which are lately very
popular at internet?
I've known him for years,
I've never heard a thing like this.
Anyway, he didn't really
interested in events like that.
He used internet as
earning money, thats all.
In that case, you didn't tell polices, that
four days ago Tarýk has rejected by Sema.
Don't be silly Cem, you told
me that there won't be any...
...connection between
that and Tarýk's suicide.
Alright, don't be angry.
I just because I wonder.
We're not fool to tell
the story to the polices.
Never mind. Anyway, Tarýk
didn't have good luck at girls.
Also we can tell him incompetent.
Ah my friend. I still can't believe.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
No! No! No!
I'm not. I'm not.
You're not real! You're not real.
You're not exist! You're not exist!
You're not exist, go away! Go away!
You wouldn't come in!
Go out! Go out!
Where are you?
This ability separate
humankind from the others.
We forget death easily.
Also it's the truth.
Now I think, many people from
my childhood are dead now.
I cried each of them.
Especially when my wife was dead.
But in short time, this
mourning is forgetting.
This is life!
We always have to be strong.
Hello, how is it going?
Thank you, welcome.
We're talking with Sema.
How are you?
I'm good. My mother called me and
told if you want return to Istanbul.
I told her that I would
stay for a little while.
It's good idea. Anyway we need
eachother, at these times.
When we'll finish the work, we'll
go to sailing with my uncle's boat.
I think we'll go to the island
that I told you before.
Girls!
Are you ready to see
something incredibley weird?
- How?
- What sort of?
I was checking my emails.
I think one is interesting.
What happened? What are
you going to show us?
Wait a minute.
Look at the mail at the top.
The one, 388@0.
Adress belongs to Tarýk.
Tarýkpoyraz11 @yahoo.com.
Yes! This is Tarýk's adress.
And the sending date is today.
How is it possible, a person
who suicided three days ago...
...sent me a mail ten minutes ago.
What is it writing?
Open the mail!
This is the most interesting part.
A weird picture attached next...
...to the writing "Take me out"
Do you look carefully at that part?
What is that in there?
Look carefully!
Do you see?
His pupils don't exist.
How could it possible?
There's something at the
backround. What are they?
Really what are those?
What are they doing?
Make it bigger.
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Alright, don't be panic.
I wonder who pictured it?
Tarýk, himself could picture it.
But, it isn't good to take an
e mail from a dead person.
Is it possible that someone
can be using his emails?
Who?
I don't know. That casette in my camera.
Excuse me?
Never mind, I don't believe there
is a connection between them.
Let's close all these.
Because I don't feel good things.
Hello! What happened Haluk?
Did results come?
Commander, they didn't get
anything from boy's computer.
Didn't they get anything? Why?
Police's brilliant computer people only
find this garbage? What are those?
Weird part of it, they told us this is the
first time they saw a thing like that.
They didn't find any viruses at computer.
All informations are in your hand.
388@0
388@0
I'm looking for what?
Yes, Do you have any hint
what are they about?
I'm going out. I'll buy bread, few
eggs and for myself chocolates.
Do you want anything?
No thanks!
Okay! See you later!
The suicide news surround
America after japan.
These weird death news especially include
young people, is paniced american people.
Even we didn' know the exact number. Last
week 1337 suicide deaths are reported.
Even some people don't care.
Authorized people are paniced!
Now, we're turning to our American
correspond to learn flash news.
Yes Yasemin, what is
going on at America?
Nobody took serious some
of the backstreet murders.
Even media, just made a
few news about them.
Government got red code,
when these deaths...
...span like viruses and
increase to thousands.
One side is living their usual
life but the others get panic.
Some said this is the biggest
case after the September 11 th.
Especially, it is shown
in campus areas.
Super power America's arms are tight.
But the fear that cover America...
Hande, is there something wrong?
No, I was engrossed in, bell make me...
My God! How can it possible?
Who is he?
What is he doing?
Gosh, What is this?
Are you ready to inside out the reality?
Noooo!
Noooo!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
My vessels are cracking!
If somebody tell me these kinds of
things will happen to me. I just laughed.
The most interesting part is I really
don't know what is going on?
Are you ready to inside out the reality?
Are you ready to inside out the reality?
I don't know its meaning.
But these are not normal.
Tarýk's death wasn't normal either.
What do you mean?
I don't want you two to see.
Tarýk filmed really weird
things with my camera.
I've took my camera that day.
There was a casette in it.
I can't believe you, how could you
hide that kind of thing from us?
I'm not hiding Sema. I
watched and afraid so much.
So I decided not to
show you to be afraid of.
Well, what is new at that pictures?
He was screaming as if there
was somebody in his room.
He taped with newspaper
every hole on the walls.
And also he was crying unusual
way and slaping himself.
Wake up! Wake up!
You're not real!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on! Where are you?
I saw you two from the window. But
when I went out you weren't there.
It was very weird
feeling as if we were dead.
That's enough. I'm going
to Istanbul. I'm not well.
Sema, I'will give cassette
and Tarýk's photo to the police.
I can't send you to Istanbul in this mood.
Cem send me Tarýk's photo by mail. I'll
give it with cassette to the police.
The best way is not to
take you to the police.
Okay!
Commander there's something that
has a connection with our case.
Suicides in Istanbul increase to 34,
authorized people start to think...
...a connection between
suicides in America.
But they don't want
to say much on that case.
Our guest is psychologist
Ahmet Tasli. Mr. Tasli, welcome.
Hello!
Is it alright to make
a connection with...
...suicides at Europe and America?
First of all there isn't any specific
age graphic at that situation.
Including Turkey, till now there isn't
any forensic and medical solution.
Just one comman point. Internet!
So can we connect these suicides with a
deviant religion or a tariqa. Does it true?
Actually, datas which come from
America show us, a tariqa that really...
...active and secret,
idea hypnotize related ones...
...at the end of it they
make them suicide.
But all known, connection on internet...
...recovers religion, culture, race,
border and passport problems.
But I want to look after totally
different perspective. Look,
In these days when we say science,
first we say America, don't we?
But as we see they have
the biggest nightmare.
And all scientists are desparate.
Briefly world entered a new period.
I believe the sutiation that humankind
is faced is ahead of science.
It's really serious.
Can you be more specific?
At last I'm a scienciest. My
explanation about this matter...
...which is interested
humankind is so incisive.
Things that we don't know and until now
we never believe it will be happen...
...Now metaphysics elements were awaken.
I mean, the elements which we exclude...
...because their beyond metarial,
overage become an irrefutable dimension.
That's why there is no explanation about
suicides and murders under science.
It's nearly the same as
dreams and reality relocate.
It's hard to accept but If we
denied that, It isn't hard to...
...say that a big danger
is waiting for world.
Especially we're a muslim country.
If we're influenced staffs like that
means we're at the highest level of...
...ignorance and irresponsibility.
Look Briefly, in the short time authorized
people have to assemble a commitee,
I've question. Somebody who killed himself
at the same time can be a murderer?
If victim and murderer is same
person, how can we tell it murder?
And we say so, person who attempt
suicide has to be tried murder attempt?
Then we can't tell it murder.
Yes!
Then we are murder department.
Why are we looking at that case?
Now I want two things from you.
First search that 388@0 file. Is
there any connection with America.
And second, find in which
religion and tariqa is using 388!
Yes Sir!
Come in!
Commander, there's a phone to you!
From whom?
Friend of that guy who
suicide. Name is Hande.
I'm taking this cassette.
We'll talk again after we
research this deeply.
Can I send you the picture
that I mention by email?
Of course!
Here it is my email.
You can send to it.
By the way there is
388@0 at Tarýk's mail's subjcet.
We didn't understand maybe
you will find something.
We found it at Tarýk's
computer informations.
We don't the meaning. My
colleagues are looking for it.
I don't believe there'll
be important thing.
Never mind I have to go.
It's better not to use internet
for a while. It's just in case.
- Good night.
- Thank you good night.
We'll see each other.
Yes, okey!
I'm OK.
You told me that here is better
then Istanbul.
Hande is preparing dinner.
Say hello!
She says hello to you.
Okey mummy, see you later.
Did Tarýk has other
weird acts before?
No, he didn't.
What do you think, Tarýk was trying
to escape? Or talking to whom.
I wish I knew. But
his voice has the reality.
Cem! What is he doing now?
Hello!
Hello!
Who are you calling?
Save me! Get me out of here!
Who are you?
Get me out of here!
Right now I'm in dream.
Right now I'm in dream.
What is this?
Uh Tarýk Uh! What
did you do? What?
Take me out!
Take me out!
Take me out!
Hello!
Hello!
Help me!
Hello!
My vessels are cracking!
My vessels are cracking!
Doesn't he answer?
It's ringing but no answer.
What happened?
I wish I told him to
stay at us tonight.
Never mind, we'll tell him tomarrow.
Hande! What do you think about the
suicide start all around the world?
I don't understand that
how could the biggest...
...fear of all death is become
very attractive to some.
Umm, Of course if its true that
all deaths are because of suicide.
What else if there is no
connection between them?
I don't know.
Honey are you hungry, aren't you?
I will make ready right now.
So on I won't make fried ones.
You have to be careful
about your colestrol.
From now on you'll eat, boiled
vegetables, salad and fruits.
I don't even talk about how much
you smoke? I'm bored to tell you.
But as the doctor says, the formula is
easy. Forbidden 3. Flour, sugar and salt.
But there's something
important. Tell me!
Water!
Yes honey, you win, water!
Why did you cheat me?
Love is a poison!
I don't understand. What do you mean?
How did you do that to
me? You cheated on me.
Don't be ridicilous Sultan.
You must be kidding.
Thanks to you, I discover the most painful
part of cheating. Do you wonder what?
Sultan!
Both loving and cheating.
That's drawn me.
That's drawn me!
That's drawn me!
Hello!
Good morning, I'm Haluk.
Sorry to interrupt so early.
Hello! Hello!
Speak Haluk! What is it
early in the morning?
Commander, one guy is dead too.
23 yaers old. Cem Terzioglu.
One of Tarýk's best friend.
Take that gum out.
Sorry commander. Of course they
knew eachother with the girls.
They saw eachother last,
yesterday at 15.00 pm.
Even we didn't understand how it was
happened, It isn't look like murder.
Forensic medicine didn't want us
to take the body until they come.
Again girls told us that
they don't know anything.
We're now at the Crime Scene.
This week this is the second one.
Public is worried because of the news
that come from round the country.
When that words happen to them, we'll
take out a Dabbe from the ground.
And this Dabbe tells them that
they don't believe the truths.
Verse 582nd. Here is the Koran. Here
is the verse. Or is your eyes blind?
...your ears deaf? Heart stone?
These people are killing
by Dabbe. Dabbe Tul Arz.
It started to action. It span like a web.
Using jinni Dabbe is using Jinni!
Dabbe is using Jinni Dabbe is
using Jinni! Dabbe is using...
Shut up! Go!
Goodbye my girl. Have good journey.
Thank you uncle Ali.
Say hello to your mother and father.
Call me after you take out the plane.
I'll.
Are you mad at me because I'm going?
No! Never! Also this isn't
right to worry your mother.
Look after yourself, don't you?
You too. Don'be sad!
Commander, police chief is coming.
Okay! Okay! Alright!
Süleyman, situation is bad.
A fax come from Ankara.
In two days they're waiting a detailed
explanation about these deaths.
Today they called me at least ten times.
If you don't put something on my desk
today, we'll be really in a big trouble.
Chief, these cases don't
look easy to solve.
To find the case connection
between the world and Turkey...
Gosh! Forget the world. You put us into
deeper trouble if you put that things in it.
Community is agitated.
Your duty is simple.
Write your report and
put them on to my desk.
Gosh! As soon as possible send
it to Ankara and get rid of it.
Yes Sir!
Pray for not to be on Tv because of
that mad man who shout at scene.
Dabbe means, a thing that spans like
a web at the ancient indian culture.
Dabbe is on of the
keenest verses in Koran.
Dabbe will appear, closed to
judgement day. Will shake the world.
All jinni will serve Dabbe.
According to us, Jinni are
the ones that are in the mirror.
When masks'll fall down,
when hearts'll turn to stone,
when shadows'll awaken,
when reality'll inside out.
When All jinni'll rush into
the world, deccale prostrate.
When Mehdi'll cry,
Deccale'll challenge,
Hello!
Hello Hande. That's me your
uncle. How are my girl?
I was calling you for a
long time. Are you okay!
Yes I'm okay. Thank you uncle.
I'm on internet right now.
That's why its busy.
After Sema I came home.
Do you need anything? If you
want come and stay with me.
Thank you uncle I have work
to do. If I feel bad, I'll come.
Alright my girl, take care yourself.
Will you come to work tomarrow?
- Huh huh. I'll come uncle.
- I'll see you in the morning. Good night!
Good night you too.
Jinni! According to us,
the ones that are in the mirror.
This is Dabbe who's
killing these people.
Dabbe tül Arz.
Here is the koran!
Here is the verse!
Dabbe using Jinni!
Dabbe using Jinni!
Dabbe!
Cem!
Cem!
Cem! What happened to you?
Dabbe!
Dabbe!
Dabbe!
Commander lately datas are here.
One, even the reasons of deaths
didn't clear, look like a insanity.
Two, we didn't find any connection
with the illegal groups.
Three, this is important, lts comman that
388@0 at world. But nobody know anything.
Ummm, did you find anything about the
tunnel that we see at dead guy's picture.
I wanted all railway tunnels from
government. Tomarrow they'll send.
By the way I got scared from the
picture while I was looking at it.
That man! Where is that man!
We have to talk with him.
Calm down Hande.
First take a deep breath.
Which man do you mention?
Today! Today the one who shouted with
Koran. That polices took him away.
I want to see him right now please.
We released him.
He's living a village near by Sirince,
alone and known as a mad man.
He's not mad. I don't know
where and how did he learn.
Actually he told us what 388@0 was.
If you talk wiser, we'll learn too.
What is writing on it?
What now?
Dabbe!
Ziya!
Ziya!
Look at us! We come to ask something.
Ziya! This man's never talked to us.
Dabbe!
How did you find out it was Dabbe?
I shouldn't have told you!
I shouldn't have told you!
I shouldn't have told you!
I shouldn't have told you!
I shouldn't have told you!
I shouldn't have told you!
I shouldn't have told you!
They'll hurt both
me and my wife!
Do you have wife?
Of course I have.
So where is she?
She is here, looking at us.
You don't have wife. If so
why don't we see her?
You can't see her because
my wife isn't a human.
Jinni!!
Is she seeing us right now?
Yes!
Well, what's her name?
Til. My wife's name is Til.
Til. Was she the one
who tell you about Dabbe?
Dabbe is killing people
by using the Jinni!
But they were angry to us.
Because of what we
say, they will kill us.
From now on, Jinni will
have been seen by people.
They will be everywhere.
Very soon!
Very soon!
There is somebody else.
Who is it?
She tells that she's your wife.
But your wife is dead, isn't she?
Ziya! Cut it off.
Jinni are possibly
duplicate dead and alive ones.
So why don't we able to see them?
They see us from the place
that we can't see them from.
But overage we'll see them too.
They found the way to seen, because...
If Jinni have technology, Is it
possible to take hold of the internet?
It's ridiculous.
Is it ridiculous to find
Dabbe at all suicide mails?
I prefer to connect with a group
called Dabbe instead of Jinni.
Either visibles!
Sometimes all of us see mental
delusions or weird dreams.
Even I get up to them.
What happened to your wife?
Hello!
Hande! Have a nice work!
Thank you uncle!
Did you call Sema?
Did she arrive to Istanbul?
Uhh yes, yes, I'm
calling right now.
Are you there?
Uncle!
Are you there?
Who are you?
What do you want?
You're not real.
No!
Judgement day!
Hello! Haluk where are you?
Commander good news. I found the tunnel!
Cleaned up the front! I just called you!
Where are you?
There are unuseful road
behind the seven sleepers.
I'm coming!
Is there anyone?
Gosh! It's not the time. Work out!
Who is there?
Who is there?
Who is there?
Handeeeee!
Süleyman!!!!
Handeeeee! Come in! Come here!
Come here!
Come in!
Handeeeee!
Süleyman!!!!
Are you there?
Süleyman what are you doing there?
Worship to shadows?
