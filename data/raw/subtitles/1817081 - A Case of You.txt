- Shoot.
Dude, you are never gonna
believe this.
A shrimp's heart is in its head.
This is fucking tripping me out.
Really, Cheech?
10:00 A.M.?
Yeah. Oh, sorry.
You getting a contact high?
You gonna be all seizuring out
on me?
I don't get seizures.
Mm-hmm.
What do you call them again?
They're marijuana-induced
fits.
It's a medical condition.
- Ha ha. Uh-huh.
What are you doing tonight?
- I don't know. I got to go.
Call me later.
- Okay.
Hello?
- So, uh, what are you doing
tonight?
I don't know.
That's why I said, "call me"
later."
- I know. I am.
So, ash and I are going to this
Alvin Ailey modern-dance thing.
Looks kind of cool.
You want to join?
Modern dance?
Not exactly what I had in mind
for tonight -- or ever, really.
- All right.
Let's definitely grab a beer
before I go.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I think I'm just gonna heat up
some Chinese food.
- You mean play video games.
All right.
Why change your routine at this
point, huh?
- I got to go. Bye.
- There you go.
Thank you.
- Hi. What can I get for you?
I'll just take a medium
coffee to go.
Thanks.
Such a -- such a beautiful day
out, and it, uh, doesn't --
doesn't feel like November at
all.
Feels like maybe early s-- early
summer -- June.
- Here you go.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Done and done.
LA te-- I-apostrophe-ticia?
L'ticia?
Okay. Thanks so much.
Thank you.
Mr. Newman, hello.
- Hello.
It's quite an honor.
My name is David abbott.
I have read all three of your
books.
Oh, thank you, David.
You can just call me "Sam."
Sam.
Can you make it out to
"sticky fingers"?
That is my avatar name.
- Sticky fingers?
Yes.
- Okay.
Question for you.
What inspired your decision to
kill of Tabitha at the end?
- Well...
Was it because she had broken
the sacred oath of the Valdrusan
nymphs?
I mean, I guess she had it
coming.
- Uh, actually, sticky, I was
sort of inspired by the movie
studio that commissioned me to
write it, honestly.
You see, the movie was already
made, so they just paid me to
write exactly happened in the
m-movie.
You know, that -- that's what I
do.
All right.
Surprise!
- Oh, my God!
Sarah!
- Hi.
Jesus.
Sarah Anderson.
Holy shit.
- Oh, no.
Actually, it's Sarah shipper
now.
Wow. Crazy.
What are you -- congratulations.
Thank you.
- That's a -- that's a rock.
W-- I don't -- what are you --
what are you doing here?
Well, my husband works around
the corner.
I was walking by and I saw your
name, and I thought, "I should"
just pop in."
- Yeah. I'm glad -- I'm sorry.
I'm glad you did.
Hi.
Oh.
- Wait. What?
Yep. That happened.
- You got a --
a baby.
- You got a baby.
Yeah.
- Wow. Wow.
What about you?
You got a wife or kids, family?
Nope. No. None of the above.
- Not even a girlfriend?
Eh.
- Aww.
Ohh.
- Congratulations on the whole
writing thing.
It's great.
Yeah. Yeah. Not -- not bad.
Not bad.
So, where does your husband
work?
You said he works around the --
oh, he's at the puma store.
Oh, no.
- Oh, he's a columnist at
the times.
- The New York time?
Yeah.
- Whoa.
Yeah.
- Cool.
Well, I'd love to get a copy
of the book.
Ohh. Really?
- Yeah. Sure.
Okay. Uh...
- Want to sign it for me?
Oh, sure.
It just seems so weird.
Let's see.
Uh, okay.
All right.
- Yeah.
How are your parents?
Uh... Uh... Yeh.
Heh. They got a -- they
got a divorce.
- What?
After I left for college, yeah.
My mom, uh --
- they always seemed like they
had the most perfect
relationship.
Hey, guess where Joel and I are
spending the summer.
Y-Y-Yosemite.
- Espoo.
Where?
- Espoo, where my whole
family's from.
Are you kidding?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. No, I remember -- in, uh,
n-Norway.
- Finland.
Finland. Near Norway.
- We talked about getting
married there, but, well, it's
nice to see that you haven't
changed at all, Sam.
So...
Take care, Sam.
- You, too.
Dude, she's pregnant!
- That sucks.
Yeah! I'm sitting there
signing autographs like a
jackass -- this stupid book.
It was so humiliating.
Sorry, Mr. Newman.
- Yeah.
My manager told me I have to
take the order now.
You want to have the special?
- Uh, no, just the usual.
Thanks, Howard.
Um... So, she looks at me like I
was the saddest, most pathet--
sorry I don't work for
the New York times.
The new the New York times
is not
really what it used to be.
I got to go.
- Oh, wait. Uh --
I have another customer to
take care of.
Well, I'll talk to you s--
- bye.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
I got to write something good.
There you go.
- What's that for?
Oh. I thought --
aren't you --
homeless?
- Sorry. I just thought that
was a --
- that's a chai.
- I'm so sorry. Uh...
Hey, what's up?
Yeah. No, I saw the instagram.
Hey, Alan.
- Hey. How'd the signing go,
guy?
- Um, it's fine.
Yeah, all right.
Total domination, right?
"Teen vampire" continues to
command the shelves.
Well, quantity over quality.
That's what I say.
All right, listen -- the
studio would like you to
translate a couple more of their
films into books.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I-i --
the first one here actually
smells pretty good.
Let me set the table for you.
It's an action-adventure flick,
and it's called
"doomtombalienwomb" -- it's one
word -- "dot-net," I think.
Check it out.
It's sizzling, and they got apps
and they got the whole thing
happening.
- Okay. Yeah. Um...
All right.
Let me move on.
I got a romantic comedy for you,
too, and this one's called
"sherpa."
- "Sherpa"?
I think you could kill
this shit.
Like the -- like the Nepal--
- yeah, a woman who climbs
Everest.
- Okay.
But in the process, she finds
the biggest discovery of her
life -- love with her sherpa
guide.
She falls in love with him.
They're from different
backgrounds.
They speak the language of
kindness or something like that.
- Listen, Alan, I don't know.
I --
- lookit -- I'm not saying that
this stuff is actually
hard-on-inducing, but you pop
off a couple more of these bad
boys --
you know what, Alan?
I think I'm gonna start writing
something else -- something
original, something personal.
Yeah.
Listen, I totally get it.
So, I'm gonna take a little
time off and start working on
this thing, okay?
All right.
Here -- here's the thing.
You're burned out.
You want to move the blocks
around.
You want to reset the table.
I'm gonna move on. Yes.
- You need to take a break, you
need to do something a little
bit different, and I totally get
that.
And that's what I want you to
do, 'cause I want you to stoke
the fire.
If you take the coal too far
away from the fire, then the
coal burns out.
If you put the coal back in the
fire, then the coal's gonna
burn.
I don't want you to ever think
that anybody has ever called you
a hack writer.
- W-- hack writer? What?
Okay. When you start writing
the pages, you send them over to
me.
- Hey, Alan, hack writer?
What are you talking about?
- I'm just telling you they
haven't said it.
- What?
I'm gonna go.
Let me know when you're doing
stuff.
- Yeah.
Okay. Bye.
Ooh, sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Aah!
Thanks. I'm really sorry.
- Just got in?
I'm sorry. What? Sorry?
- Oh, I'm just saying I think I
saw you come in to work.
- Oh, yeah.
I am late as usual.
- Yeah, always late.
Ah!
Can I get a refill for you?
Oh, yeah. Uh, thanks.
Oh, shit!
- What? Are you okay?
No. Fuck.
Um, I think someone just stole
my computer.
- Oh, God.
Yeah, I had it here, and I
put it in a bag.
It was in a blue computer bag.
I was gonna go to the bathroom.
Do you have another one?
- Do you s-- hmm?
Besides that one?
No. That's it.
Just that one, actually.
Thanks.
No, it would have been
devastating if you lost your
masterpiece.
No reason to go on.
I know.
Fortunately, it's just two pages
of bad haikus and dirty
limericks.
- But you're a doodlist as
well, I see.
- Oh, yeah. I just scribble.
I dabble in the doodles myself.
Yeah? Really?
- Yeah. I do caricatures in
prospect park.
- Oh, cool.
I'm sorry.
Is this gorbachev?
No, that's just a creepy guy.
- Oh. That's too bad.
I'm a huge gorbachev fan.
- Oh. Well, let's --
now it's gorbachev.
You can gorbachev anything.
That's really good.
Thanks.
- It's birdie.
It's very birdie.
- Oh, my name is birdie.
Oh, okay. Sorry.
Um...
I'm Sam.
Uh, that's my name.
It's like "Pam" with an "s."
Oh. So -- so, spam.
- No, the "p" is silent.
It's confusing.
- I would love to continue this
conversation, but --
- yeah, of course. Sorry. Yeah.
Sorry.
- Large coffee, almond milk,
three sweet'n lows, two napkins.
The name's Emily.
Nice to meet you.
- Emily, like "jemily," but the
"j" is silent.
Actually, "gemily" is spelled
with a "g," usually.
Is it?
Do you know any Gemilys?
Sorry.
Hey, El, where's the
toothpaste?!
El!
Hey, what'd you --
oh, shit!
Shit.
- What the fuck?
Sorry.
- You can't do that with the
door wide open.
- Well, I thought you were in
the shower.
I always wait till you're in the
shower.
- You do? Oh, God.
Now every time I take a shower,
I'm gonna think about that.
Can I turn around?
- Yeah.
Is that princess Leia?
- N-- yeah.
Are you seriously jerking off
to current pictures of
Carrie fisher?
- Remember when we were kids,
dude?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you
were pretty obsessed with her,
too.
Yeah, I was obsessed with
her when she was in "star wars."
What am I, 12?
You really expect me to pleasure
myself to fucking "star wars"?
- What are you talking about?
You can get older, and she can
stay the same age in picture
form.
- Women, like men, grow up.
Everybody ages.
It's a natural fact of life.
You're not dating her.
You're just jerking off to her.
All right.
- I -- okay, yeah.
Just close your door next time.
- Can you close it?
Ugh!
- Are you going back in the
shower, by any chance?
- Please don't.
Just please don't.
Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.
Do you by any chance know what
time birdie -- or it might be
"bertie" -- is working?
- It's "birdie," like "caw,
caw!"
You're a friend of hers?
Uh, yeah, sort of.
She got canned.
- What?! Why? What happened?
She was late.
- For work?
No. For her fucking period.
- Why -- I'm sorry.
I don't know what's g--
I feel like maybe we got off on
the wrong foot.
I'm Sam, by the way.
Okay.
- And your name is?
It's Gerard.
- Gerard.
Strard.
- Stre-Gerard.
Strard.
- Stard.
Stard.
- Chard.
Leave it.
- Anyway, what happened with
birdie?
- I already told you she was
late.
Right. But j-just --
- anything else,
inspector Watson?
- No, that's -- that's great.
Thanks for --
do you think maybe she'll come
back here?
For what?
- I don't know.
Me, neither.
Why don't you just find her
online?
- I don't know her --
birdie hazel.
- Hazel.
Okay.
Thank-- thanks, g-- sir.
Okay.
I think I got everything.
Where you guys going?
- I told you a trillion times
we're going to Ashley's parents'
place.
Then we're going to
sacred spirit.
Oh, right -- camp brainwash.
Eliot, don't forget your camera.
I think it's on the desk.
- Oh, yes.
Bye!
- Bye-ee!
Hey, El, I found birdie's online
profile.
You did? Who?
- You know, the coffee-shop
girl.
Pretty amazing, actually.
- Oh, yeah? Nice.
Yeah. You got to see this.
I don't know what to do.
What's the next move?
- Write her a message saying
you want to see her.
- Really? Should I?
That seems weird.
Just, like, a blind message?
I don't -- I don't know anything
about her.
Yeah. Sure, you do.
That's the beauty of getting to
see her Facebook profile.
There's so much information on
there, you know?
I mean, hell, you could become
the man of her dreams if you
wanted.
That's true.
- You know?
Baby?
- Yo.
Come on. I'm double-parked.
What are you doing?
Oh, shit.
See you next week, playa.
See you.
Oh. Uh, okay.
I'm not sure I got that one.
Next finger goes on the -- is
that a fret?
It's called a fret.
Sorry. I don't know --
you got to bar it.
- Ow. Ow.
Okay. That's it?
It sounded different than yours.
- Will you stop with the 'tude
and the condescending shit?
Music is about opening.
Your generation is so... Sexy and
they know it and they're
texting.
Just 'cause you got my number
off a telephone pole doesn't
mean I'm not ferocious on the
ax.
I played fucking Woodstock, man.
- Woodstock? Really?
That's kind of -- 'cause you
don't really seem that --
Woodstock '99, captain!
So, you want to fuck with that?
I played backup with the fucking
spin doctors, bro-rometer.
Wow.
- Yeah, wow.
That's pretty cool.
- It's really cool.
Look it up.
- I'll Google it.
Yeah. Do that.
I didn't technically play
backup, but I was backing them
up from a choice seat backstage.
I'm pretty tight with
Chris barron's brother.
Is he -- is he in
the spin doctors?
Are you f'ing fucking with me?
I-I don't --
- is this "punk'd"?
Am I "punk'd"?
Are you Ashley Kutcher?
Ashton.
- Who doesn't know
Chris barron?
- I don't. Sorry.
He's the original doc.
He hooked me up with backstage
passes, and we did enough "k" to
date-rape a horse.
What's "k"?
- And you want to be a rock
star.
Without "k," the spin doctors
would be spin nurses.
It's a fucking horse
tranquilizer, champion.
- Gary, I totally respect your
musical background, and that's
why I just really want you to
teach me how to play.
- Yeah? Why?
I just want to --
- why?
I just want to learn.
- Nobody just wants to learn.
You either want money, pussy, or
fame.
Which one is it?
- I just want to learn.
Money, pussy, or fame?
- I want to --
which one is it?
Well, okay. There's a girl.
- So, it's pussy.
Yeah, fine, I guess.
- Well, does she have a pussy?
Can you just tell me where
the "g" is, please?
It's right above the clit,
inside the pussy.
The "g" chord.
Can you -- what are you doing?
If you just listen -- shh! --
And stop fucking around,
Dr. Gary will teach you a thing
or three.
You know what I mean?
- I think so.
Tap out.
Tap out.
I'm trying.
- Tap out!
I'm trying.
- Tap out.
Ugh!
- This is good!
Holy Jesus!
Hey, Gerard.
- Hey.
I'm, uh, here to pick up my
last paycheck.
Somebody stole it.
- What?
What?
I'm joking. Jesus!
Don't get your boyshorts in a
panty bundle.
How could someone possibly steal
it and then cash it?
I-I-i don't know.
- Exactly, genius.
I stole it and tried to cash
it -- didn't work.
Great. Well... I'm just glad
it's still here.
Did he find you?
- Who?
That Laotian boy.
Oh, you can run, but you can't
hide.
When you're done with him, give
him my digits.
Okay.
I-i don't -- I don't know what
you're talking about, so I'm
just gonna take this.
Thank you.
hey! Welcome home!
- What the fuck is going on?
Oh, man. You missed --
oh, shit!
I got to flip the mahi!
Ahh!
Damn it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
Ah, I knew it.
Should have done the medallions.
Should have done the medallions.
What is going on, man?
- Oh. I... Found some
inspiration.
- Cocaine?
Ha ha ha ha.
No, no, no.
Let's just say a little bird
helped me out.
I'm not -- not getting it.
- Birdie! Duh.
The coffee-shop girl.
- Birdie. Right.
Can you turn that down a little?
Way down.
Sorry, man. Sorry.
Listen, I got to tell you
something.
I haven't felt this way in such
a long time.
I feel this, like, uh -- like a
jolt, you know -- like a thump.
- Don't say, "spark."
A spark. It's true!
I can't explain it any other
way.
It's this intangible feeling
that... Feels pretty good.
- I love that, man.
That's great.
- Oh, shit. Is she coming over?
You want me to go to Ashley's?
- Oh, no.
She's not coming here.
- Oh, she's not?
That's great, though.
You guys been hanging?
No.
- You been talking on the phone
with her?
- No.
A little online chatting?
- Not quite.
See, I'm getting a little
creeped out, man.
I'm doing exactly what you
said.
What I told you to do?
- Yeah. I'm becoming the man of
her dreams.
- I don't think that that --
I'm preparing for the moment
to arise.
I've been studying her Facebook
page all week.
I know it backwards and
forwards.
I'm visualizing the whole thing.
I got it.
- Okay. How 'bout this?
Yeah?
- Visualize writing her a
message but then literally do it
right now.
Write her a message r-right
now?
Yeah.
Okay. You know what?
Screw it. You're right.
Let's do this.
- All right.
This is the moment.
Carpe diem.
Um... Okay.
So, what -- what do I write?
Uh, uh, uh... Got it.
- Okay.
"I love and invite my
soul..."
What is this? What is this?
- This is "leaves of grass,"
Walt Whitman.
Birdie loves Whitman.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
Really? Why? Why? Why?
- Dude, look at this. Look.
"Hey, babe.
I hope you're still coming to my
show on Tuesday. Lol. Jackie."
Who's Jackie?
It's Jackie Williams.
She's an aspiring actress.
Their parents are family
friends.
She loves Kathy Griffin.
She's an aquarius.
She does the show on Tuesday
night that used to be "improv."
Oh, my God.
It's really disturbing you know
that, but that's your in.
- What do you mean, that's my
in?
I'm gonna go to some shitty
improv show, sit through the
whole thing, just so I can stare
at her in the audience?
- No. You -- so you can talk to
her.
- All right, flower, grow!
Grow! Grow! Grow! Faster!
Why don't you grow faster,
flower?
Now run around.
Ahhh!
- Yeah, but you love that
flower.
Tell that flower that you love
her.
She has to to turn into a
flower, then turn into growing
water, then turn into something
big.
You want to check that!
That was pretty funny.
- Hey. Can I get one of these?
Oh, my God. Wait, wait.
Oh. Do you ever go to the
second stop cafe?
- Well...
Oh, gorbachev!
- Sam.
That's it! Yeah. Yeah.
Birdie.
Birdie? Yeah.
- Both: What have you been up
to?
- I -- Jesus.
Oh, no.
Um, nothing.
Just, uh, watching...
- Really bad improv.
Glad you said that.
It was -- yikes.
Though I commend them for their
courage.
I would never have the nerve to
get onstage like that if I
didn't have a guitar in my
hands.
You play guitar?
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit --
just to relax and stuff.
Mellow stuff, yeah -- Joan baez
kind of stuff.
- Oh, you like Joan baez?
I love Joan baez!
- She's the best! Yeah!
No, she's my favorite.
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding?
I grew up with her.
Not literally, but --
right.
- She's amazing.
"Diamonds and rust"?
- Dude, every time I walk into
Washington square, I think of
that.
Me, too.
- "Now you're smiling, looking"
out the window of that crummy
hotel over Washington square.
Our breath comes out white
clouds, mingles, hangs in the
air."
Ohh!
I know. Oh, my God.
Every time I'm in the park, I
think that.
- Yeah.
Well, um, listen, next time I'm
in the second stop, you got to
give me the Joan baez fan
discount.
- I would love to.
It might be a little hard now
since I was fired.
I know... Now. Now I know.
Uh, that sucks.
I'm glad that I ran into you
here, though.
Yeah, me, too.
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!
Oh, hey, girl.
Oh, you were so good -- so good.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.
Literally, you couldn't have
picked a better night, except
for that skank who kept cutting
me off.
Uh, well, j-Jackie, Sam.
- Hey.
Hey, Sam.
- Um, Sam was just saying
something about the show, right?
What is it that you were saying?
Well, we were laughing...
- Thank God.
...and saying that we will
never forget this night.
That was it.
- It was very memorable.
Literally?
- Yep.
Thanks.
So, do you know someone in the
troupe, or...
No. I just -- I enjoy the art
form.
Art form? Wow.
Thank you, Sam.
Dibs.
So, do you have to --
- no.
Oh.
- Can I cook you dinner
sometime?
Hey!
Oh, sorry.
I need some scented candles,
dried flowers, incense -- either
passion or don Juan brand -- and
there's something else that I
didn't write down.
Oh, sage. Do you sell sage?
Great.
Hello?
- Sam, hey.
I am so sorry.
I got caught up.
Yeah, totally.
That's cool.
I wasn't sure if you
remembered --
I'm at the hospital, actually.
Oh, my God.
- I'm fine.
Um... Mm.
My ex is a carpenter, actually,
and he hurt his hand...
- And he didn't have anyone
else to drive him.
- That's actually a really nice
thing to do.
- He would do the same thing
for me.
Well, I really want to make it
up to you.
I take a ballroom class every
Thursday if you're interested.
- Oh, I also do ballroom.
You do?
- Honestly, though, I haven't
done it since I was really,
really young, but...
Well, you better find
something snazzy to wear.
Okay. I will.
- All right.
I'll talk to you then.
- Okay, good. Good.
All right.
- Bye.
Bye.
Okay.
I-I like your outfit.
- Thanks.
What do you -- where are your
dancing clothes?
Oh, I've got them on.
They're just under here.
It's just like a wife beater and
a t-shirt.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
I think I'm gonna go home and
change really quick.
Oh, no.
- I misinterpreted what you
said.
- No, no. Come on.
Uh...
- Just take your jacket off a
second.
I'm sure it's fine.
Okay, I-i-i got to -- I just
got to tell you, when I was
dancing, they wore different
things, and you said,
"snazzy."
- I know. I did say, "snazzy."
Okay, really quick.
You can't laugh or else I'm
jumping out of the cab.
Okay.
- No, no! I don't --
I mean, that was a laugh of
excitement because it's so
snazzy.
- Can I go home?
I'm just gonna put a t-shirt --
- I think it's great.
I think it's great.
Some people dress us, so it's
okay.
- Oh, no.
And we're here anyway, so...
It's gonna be fine.
I got you.
I promise it's gonna be -- it's
gonna be fine.
- Oh, please. Okay.
Oh, uh, sorry, sir.
How much -- how much do I owe
you?
What are you doing?
Oh, it's right here.
- Oh, okay.
He-ey!
- Hey!
Birdie, what have we got here?
Harriet, Henry, this is my
new recruit, Sam.
Oh, Sam.
- Raymond's not gonna be
pleased.
- Ah, he'll be fine.
Hey, nice threads.
- Oh, thank you.
You a pro?
- No. Are you?
How do you define a pro?
- Well, it's someone who gets
paid for dancing, I guess.
- Oh, not with money.
We get rewards in other ways.
- Ahh.
Pride.
- Right.
Roberto.
- Oh, hi. Sam.
Mercedes.
- Oh, hello. Hi.
We've won this thing for the
last three years.
Don't get any ideas.
Okay.
Wow.
- It's not a competition.
Oh. Did someone tell them
that?
So, let me get this straight --
you write novels for movies that
already exist.
Yes. Yep.
Did you see, um, you know,
"teen vampire"?
- That -- that was huge.
The movie was, yeah.
The novelization was, uh, not so
much.
- I'm gonna read it anyway.
You don't have to read it,
really.
Just rent the movie.
- What's your favorite book?
"The teachings of don Juan: A
yaqui way of knowledge."
Are you serious?
- What?
That's my favorite book.
- What?!
Yeah! Oh, when he turns into
the --
the crow.
- Dude, I tripped out in
college.
- I tripped out so hard.
First day on the job, rookie?
- No.
First day on the job, rookie.
- Okay, he just said that.
What's with those two?
- Ah, don't listen to them.
Ohh! Yeah, see?
You actually have some pretty
sweet moves.
Oh, thanks.
Must be all the judo training.
Deep into judo.
What?
What's so funny?
Nothing. No.
It's just... My parents' dog's
name is judo, and you said,
"deep into judo."
That just sounded funny.
I'm an infant.
- Yeah. Your parents' dog is
named judo?
- Yeah.
That is funny.
Invite her to the next
sacred spirit retreat.
This one's only one night.
- Are you kidding?
No. I actually like this girl.
Are you drinking whiskey?
- Bourbon.
Bourbon?
- I hate it so much.
It's her favorite, though.
Got to build up my immunity.
Are you okay?
- It's so smooth.
hey, Gerard, what's another
word for "smitten"?
I think you might be the
first guy I've ever met that
I wish I could draw.
That is such a dope talent.
You know, this one here is
quite the talented artist
himself.
- Yeah, right.
I'm -- no, I'm not.
I'm not as -- not as dope as she
is.
Oh, my God. That's so funny.
These are so good.
Do you have, like, a time
frame to make it doing drawing
or whatever?
- Well, what do you mean, "make"
it"?
Success is a myth.
Love's the only true currency.
After all this is done, all that
really matters is how and who
you loved.
There must be something that
you're working toward, right?
This.
- What do you mean, this?
This brings me happiness.
You know, and maybe, you know,
in a week or maybe a year from
now, it won't, but, you know,
then I'll just move on to the
next thing that does.
All right.
- It's good.
I think -- I think we're
done, yeah.
It's about time.
- You two are such a rad
couple.
You both draw or whatever.
It's so cool.
I remember when Kyle first --
hey, let's go.
- Sorry.
Good luck.
- Good luck to you.
Yeesh.
You must not be able to always
draw people completely
accurately at the risk of
offending them, I imagine.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, every now and then, you
get someone that's, like,
slightly offended.
- I kind of miss Kyle, in a
weird way.
- Yeah, well, we'll always have
the memory of Kyle in our
hearts.
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.
We can always look back and
smile.
What?
Nothing. I'm...
Just glad I met you.
That's all.
I was --
- oh.
Both: Sorry.
- Um... Sorry.
That was -- I was supposed to
kiss you on the cheek.
Right.
Cheek, too.
Are you free tonight?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
- Sure.
So, your ex is singing tonight?
This is the one from the
hospital?
Yes, Tony.
- Oh, cool.
He's really cool, and he just
got back from, like, traveling
all around the world.
- Wow.
Yeah. I can't wait for you to
meet him, though.
He's gonna love you.
- Oh. I... Can't wait... To be...
Loved by him.
I thought you said, um -- I
mean, isn't he a carpenter or --
yeah, yeah.
Well, you know, Tony is an
interesting one because he kind
of does, like, a little bit of
everything, so he just got into
carpentry, and he's juts been
doing it on the side for friends
and family.
Oh, very cool.
- Yeah.
He's like a Jack of all trades.
Exactly.
- I can't wait to meet him.
Hey!
- Jesus Christ.
Tony!
- Oh, Tony, hey.
It's you, right?
- Hey. How's it going?
I am so fucking glad to meet
you.
Yeah. Fucking... Good to meet
you.
Thanks for coming up.
Mm. Wow. Looking good.
Thanks.
- I love you, babe.
Oh, you know I wouldn't miss
it.
Yeah? Come on.
Let's get this musical debacle
started.
- Yeah.
I can't wait to hear you play.
I've heard so much about you.
Oh, that's good of you to
say, man.
Thanks a lot.
I can't wait to play, but I went
and chopped up my paw really
good.
Oh.
- Tony, you have to be more
careful next time.
- Yeah, okay.
You hear that?
That is exactly the reason why
she gets along with my ma.
Aww.
- Oh, my God!
What?
- I can't believe I didn't
think of this.
Sam plays guitar.
Seriously?
- Yeah.
No. Brother.
- Oh.
You're up.
- Oh, n-- oh, well --
he plays!
- No, no! No, no, Tony.
Would you? Come on.
- Tony, honestly --
I won't take "no" for an
answer.
Please, Tony.
Don't do this to me.
Tony...
- You guys ready?
Brother, you ready?
- Yeah.
3...2...Go.
- I got to tune this up.
You know what?
I should tune.
Sorry, guys.
It's how this is -- yeah. Yeah.
Is this -- this is --
- you take your time, bro.
You take your time, brother.
- I don't think -- I'm not
really used to playing this.
I'm a righty.
He's good, right?
I mean, he does this -- yeah.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Can you do it with him?
Ohh! What?! I'm sorry.
Popped -- popped the old string.
Sorry, guys.
- It's all right, brother.
Oh, sorry.
I owe you a guitar.
Things break.
They're objects.
It's all right.
- All right. Thanks, brother.
This one's gonna go out for you.
- What was that?
I just -- it's too hard.
Too much.
Don't worry about it.
Birdie hazel, ladies and gents!
Bring her on up!
- Oh, oh.
Come on up, doll.
- No!
Come on.
- Hurry.
Okay.
- Hurry.
All right.
You're so -- so amazing.
Like, I had no idea you could do
that.
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh. Oh, my God.
Talented.
- Hi!
Oh, hey.
- Hey.
This -- hey.
- Hi.
Hi.
- This is birdie.
I'm Ashley.
We've heard so much about you.
Hey. I'm eliot.
- Nice to meet you.
Birdie.
- Yeah.
I feel like I know you already.
He won't stop talking about you.
- Oh, uh-oh. Stalker alert.
No, no. Nothing like that.
- Oh, did you tell her about
the, uh, sacred spirit retreat?
- No, eliot.
You guys, you don't have to
come.
Sacred spirit? What? What?
- It's this -- go ahead.
Well, the next one's only one
night.
It's sort of a nightly camp to
kind of gather your thoughts.
Bunch of other people out in
nature -- refresh your spirit.
That sounds awesome.
That's, like, right up my alley,
yeah.
- Yeah! It's cool.
> It's pretty cool.
Do you -- you want to go?
Really?
- Yeah. I mean, really.
Would that be cool?
- Oh...
Absolutely.
- ...Yeah.
Yeah. Please. Please.
- If that's okay, that'd be
great.
- Yeah.
That's great.
- Yes!
Oh, great. Oh, good.
'Cause I wanted to go, too,
so...
- Perfect. Perfect.
Awesome.
Well, it was nice to meet you
guys.
Um, where's the nearest subway
stop?
- Oh, I'll walk you --
no, no. Forget it.
Get in the car. It's too cold.
Really?
- Yeah. Sure.
Oh, my God. That's so nice.
Thank you. Um, okay.
All right.
Uh...
- Bye.
Bye.
Hey. Here.
- Oh, I -- oh.
I got it.
- Where am I going?
You really got it.
- Just...
She seems great!
- She knows not to say
anything, right?
[Intro to Lord Huron's
Hey, El, do you have a cool,
like, hippie-type shirt I could
wear for the retreat?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep. Just give me a minute.
What are you doing?
- I'm just looking at a
magazine.
- Looking at a magazine?
We got to go!
What magazine you looking at?
Martha Stewart livin.
- Why -- oh, God.
Martha Stewart? Really?
- Yeah, dude.
You got to see this
Thanksgiving-issue cover.
It's insane.
- No, I'm good.
Buddy, we got to go.
- All right.
Thanks for killing the mood.
- Sorry.
You pumped for the retreat?
- Pumped? No.
Do you have -- oh.
- Birdie will love it.
You think?
- Thanks.
- It's really cold.
Ahh.
Yeah. You know, I don't -- I
don't really smoke that much,
but what the hell?
- Yeah. Me, too.
I'm not exactly the lead singer
of phish, either, but you know
what the say -- when at
retreats...
Dude... You sure?
- I'll light the old Christmas
tree whenever I get the urge.
What?
- "Christmas tree"?
S'mores for me.
- S'mores, Sam.
Mm.
So, birdie, is that, like, a
nickname, or that's --
God. No, my parents were
hippies, and they felt like the
world was caging in on us, so
they wanted their little girl to
fly free -- hence, birdie.
- That's so cool.
Oh, no.
- No, no.
What's wrong?
Hey, it might be the shrooms
talking to the "k," but don't
you teach me guitar?
- No, it's the shrooms talking
to you.
- You teach me guitar.
No, no.
- Hey, is this the chick?
No.
- Is this the little pussy?
Hey, guys, I'm gonna -- I'm
gonna go get some s'mores, I
think.
- Okay.
You good?
- Where you going?!
A little high.
You want a s'more?
Hello?
What the fuck?
Sam.
Sam.
Huh?
- You okay?
Oh, no. I'm chillin'.
- Guys, come on.
This mantra's not gonna chant
itself.
Okay!
Oh, Jesus.
Your boyfriend is killing me
with this thing.
I was doing so well, too.
It was happening.
It was flowing.
Now I'm so stoned.
I'm so fucked.
I'm gonna be completely exposed.
What are you doing?
- Huh?
Oh, eating helps calm me down
when I'm stressed out.
I have a medical condition.
These are disgusting.
No, what -- what are you
doing with the girl?
What are you talking about?
Completely exposed?
Sam, it's -- it's a little
dramatic, I think.
Ash, look at her.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect fit.
I can't do this shit.
It's not me.
I don't know what I'm doing
here.
This was such a mistake.
It's called "compromise."
Look, wine tasting isn't exactly
Eliot's, like, favorite thing in
the world, but remember?
He took me to the finger lakes
last summer.
We had a really good time 'cause
he knew it was something that I
had always wanted to do.
- He showed me the pictures.
I know!
And, look, I am not really into
all this spiritual
mumbo-jumbo...
Right?
- ...But I come on all these
retreats with him.
Look, you don't have to love it.
You just have to try it for the
sake of your partner.
Right.
You're right.
Eyes on the prize, soldier.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Eyes on the prize.
Here. Take a napkin.
- Uh, no. I'm good.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Both: Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
Eyes on the prize.
All: Eyes on the prize.
- That's what I said now.
I'm the one that loves you,
baby, can't you see?
I'm the one that loves you,
baby, can't you see?
Just go ahead now.
If you want to buy me flowers,
just go ahead now.
- I wish I could say that was
the craziest that that I've ever
done just now.
I-I can say that, easily.
I-i can say that I've never
started a chant before.
- You had them going!
They loved it!
- Yeah. That got --
it was fun.
- It got intense.
Okay.
If you could go anywhere in the
world, where would you go?
- Orlando, definitely.
I've always wanted to go to
Orlando or maybe one of the
outlying suburbs of Orlando.
I don't know.
I haven't traveled as much as I
want to.
I really want to travel.
I've never even been outside the
states.
Really? Oh, man.
- I'd love to go to the
Galápagos islands, though.
That's the -- that's the
place -- one place I'd want to
go.
That's so crazy.
- Why?
That's, like, the one place
on earth I don't want to go.
R-- r-- are you kidding?
- No. Well, okay.
I love what it represents, and
I'm in love with place, but I-i
feel like by going there, it
would be like the end of what
makes it what it is.
You know?
It's like this untouched part of
the world, and it's got all
these incredible animals that
you can't find anywhere else,
and they're just roaming freely.
- Tortoises and...
There's, like, this natural
perfection to it.
Right. So, that's --
what's wrong with that?
That sounds -- that sounds
great.
Yeah, but I feel like we'd
find a way to fuck it up, you
know?
Selfishly, I'd love to go, I'd
love to experience it, but if we
got to go, so would bloated
tourists who want to make that a
honeymoon.
No, thanks.
No, that's -- that's exactly
how I feel about Orlando.
Oh, my God.
My parents would love this.
Oh, really?
- Yeah.
They must be, like
superhippies.
Let me put it this way -- in
college, they had a band called
hemp hemp hooray.
- What?
That's -- that's amazing.
- Yeah.
Where do they live?
- They live in Oregon, growing
God knows what on their farm.
What about you?
What about your parents?
- Ma -- my dad's fine.
He's, uh, up in Vermont, living
the quiet life.
He's a retired -- retired
columnist, very heady.
Nice.
- Yeah.
What about your mom?
Where's your mom?
Uh...
My mom and I had sort of, um --
sort of an up-and-down
relationship -- mostly down, I
guess.
She left my dad for someone else
who she thought was better and
kind of stopped talking to me in
the process.
Just sort of -- sort of cut us
off.
So, you guys... Don't talk at
all anymore?
Um, no.
I-i got a card in the mail about
three years ago.
No, four, actually, now.
God. Yeah, it was from her new
husband, and it just said that
she'd -- she'd passed away.
But, you know, we hadn't talked
in like five years, so it was --
it was -- it was actually --
wasn't as bad as it could have
been.
I-I'm -- I-i kind of hate
talking about this stuff.
Yeah, no.
Um... We don't have to talk about
it.
I'm so sorry.
- No, no. It's okay.
It's all right.
I'm just -- I'm just stoned, and
it's a lot.
I love this stuff, though,
you know?
- I think we are who we are
when we're with the people that
make us feel the most alive.
I don't know.
I feel very alive right now.
I-i-i can't -- I can't decide
which is better -- the fact that
it's minus 20 degrees out or the
millions of twigs jabbing me in
the ass right now.
I know! I have, like, a root
jabbing me.
I'll jab you the root.
Sorry.
That's -- that's too bad,
'cause I really love dirty
nature double entendres.
- Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
- Try saying that 10 times
fast.
Dirty nature double entendres.
Dirty nature double entendres.
Dirty nature double entendres.
It can't be done.
It's impossible.
Dirty...
Nature...
Double...
Entendres.
I think I can feel that root you
were talking about.
It's here. It's growing.
Really?
- Hey.
Hey.
- I think -- I think we're good
to go.
- Yeah, we're good.
Hey, um...
I got to go out -- get the rest
of the stuff.
Okay.
I told her about my mother last
night.
Such an idiot.
Guarantee she's putting the
pieces together.
- I don't know. She seems down.
Yeah.
El, she's down with the fake me.
It's fucking stupid.
I should never have done this.
Well, I don't know.
I think you're pretty awesome.
You just seem -- mnh-mnh-mnh.
Mnh.
You just need to -- to be
totally honest with you right
now...
Yeah?
What?
Are you driving?
- Not... At the moment.
I was about to.
- Give me the keys.
Hello?
- Hey, I love it, my man.
I love where this thing is
going.
You do?
- Yeah.
That's -- that's great.
Uh... I'm -- I'm -- I'm really
glad you're into it.
- I'm more than into it.
You got my elegant wife and this
pack of whores she runs with
cunt-bumping over this thing.
- Oh. That's... Awful.
Yeah, trust me -- no one's
ever gonna call you a hack
writer again.
- Okay, wait.
Alan, who keeps --
- sorry.
I got another call coming in.
I have to jump, okay?
I love you.
- Ok-- love... You, too.
Bobby!
Was that birdie?
- What? Uh, no.
Uh... It was Alan.
- Oh.
You got to help me come up
with a date for birdie.
I've gone through everything on
the page.
She hasn't updated it in weeks.
I need something.
So, why don't you go
somewhere where you want to go
for a change -- you know,
something from your profile?
Yeah, but it's got to be up
her alley.
You're up her alley, douche.
Well, how 'bout that prop-shop
place you love?
- Go there on a date?
What would we do?
- Uh, shop, talk, not be
obsessed with being someone
else.
I don't know.
I have no idea if she'd be into
that kind of stuff.
It seems incredibly risky.
Oh, man.
Nope. Got to stick to the plan.
Ooh!
- Oh, boy.
It's all coming back to you,
right?
Oh, yeah.
It's like riding a bike -- a
really steep, difficult bike.
Fuck!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Why?
Aah!
Fess Parker?
Sorry.
I'm sorry it's raining.
- Well, it's okay.
It's not entirely your fault.
- Heh. Yeah.
I'm excited, though.
This seems really cool.
Well, don't get too excited.
I mean, I like it, but, you
know, to each his own.
So, they're props -- these are
all props from movies.
This is so cool!
I love it!
I feel like a kid in here!
I just want to play with
everything!
- Right? That's the point, and
you can.
Yes. I'm gonna wear this to
the Kentucky derby.
It's -- I don't know if
you're even doing a joke 'cause
it's actually nice on you.
I'm gonna wear this to
something.
Oh, my God, look.
This is perfect.
Oh, my God.
- Look. Yes.
- Ohh.
- - It's so good.
Ah, it brings me back.
It's crazy.
- It brings you back?
To what -- your tour of duty in
Iwo Jima?
Yeah.
No, what does it remind you
of, though, seriously?
Oh... Nothing. Nothing.
- Oh, come on. I want to know.
It's not even like I'm, like,
holding out with some great
thing.
- Okay, so tell me.
It's not a big deal.
- I was in the boy scouts.
I was a boy scout.
- Oh, that's so cute!
Oh, God.
Why wouldn't you want to tell me
that?
That's adorable!
Did your parents make you do it
as a kid?
Sort of.
You know, you can -- people
don't know this, but you can be
in the boy scouts till you're
18.
It's not just, like, little --
were you in the boy scouts
till you were 18?
Yeah. I wasn't as into -- I
was really more into it -- I
know.
See, it's not cute.
No, it's so good.
Wait. Please tell me you still
have the uniform.
- Well, yeah.
Sadly, I think it probably fits
me.
Okay. Well, you're gonna have
to wear this for me at some
point, because I actually find
that really sexy.
You do?
- I do.
It's weird, but I'm serious.
- Really?
Everyone's allowed, like, a
nerdy skeleton in their closet.
Oh, yeah? Well, just one?
- Actually, no.
You're allowed a whole closetful
of nerd skeletons.
Well, I would -- I would -- I
would need an industrial-size
walk-in closet, then...
- Oh, really?
...for all my nerdy
skeletons.
Give me another, uh -- give
me another example, then.
No.
- A really nerdy one.
I mean, there are just so many.
No, I'm serious, really.
Just one more.
I feel like one nerdy
skeleton a day revealed is --
no. No, I definitely -- the
nerdier, the sexier.
You know that, right?
- Okay. Well, in that case,
uh... I was in a band.
- That's not that nerdy.
That's cool -- unless you're
like a new kid on the block.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
I was the lost Wahlberg brother.
- I knew it!
I'm Wally Wahlberg!
- You look so much alike.
Right?
I get that all the time, mostly
in the ab region.
- No, really, what did you do?
Did you play guitar or
something?
Uh... Oh, man.
- What did you do?
I-I did bass.
- You did bass?
Mm-hmm.
- That's either an expression
I've never heard or something's
going on here.
Well, I -- yeah, I mean, if
you consider the voice an
instrument, I played.
- Were there any actual
instruments in this band?
No, ma'am.
- This is an a cappella group,
isn't it?
- Nope.
You were in an a cappella
group.
In an a cappella band, yes.
I was in an a cappella band.
I can't believe you were in a
a cappella group and you didn't
tell me.
- Well, why --
Why would I tell
you that?
Because it's awesome and we
could have harmonized.
This is -- is not so awesome.
There were as many women in this
band as there were instruments.
- It was an all-male a cappella
group?
- It was an all-male a cappella
group.
- Oh, my God.
Yes, ma'am.
It was a man band, so get it
straight.
- Oh, there's nothing...
Straight about it.
I'm out of here.
Go fuck yourself, eliot!
- What was that?
She saw all of it, man --
Jamie Lee Curtis,
Kathleen Turner,
christie Brinkley.
Wait. Kathleen Turner?
Really?
Dude...
- I'm sorry.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
She... Gave me an ultimatum.
Either the file goes or she
goes, so she went.
Wait a second.
Uh... You're talking about a
bunch of photos of old
celebrities that you jerk off to
and your girlfriend, and you
picked the photos?
Just because I'm keeping the
file doesn't mean that I love
her any less.
- Why not just do whatever
makes her happy?
Or if you got to keep them, just
lie to her and say you threw
them out.
It's not just about the
stupid fucking pictures!
I don't even -- I don't care.
It's just how much of myself, of
what makes me who I am, can I
just erase or throw out?
Fuck it.
I'm sorry for waking you up.
It's okay.
- So, I have a surprise for the
recital next Friday.
- Oh, yeah?
Yep.
- Full of surprises.
Uh, my parents are coming.
- Whoa!
Yeah.
- That's crazy.
They're really nice, they're
really mellow, so it's no
pressure at all.
- Okay.
Do you, um -- do you want to
come upstairs for a nightcap?
A nightcap?
What year is this?
Shut up.
I assumed that you knew that
"nightcap" is a euphemism for
sexy time.
Uh, no. No.
I never heard that.
Um, I'd love to come up and
nightcap you, but, um, I don't
think the Indian food and the
dance moves are really joining
in perfect harmony.
- I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
- Ohh. Well, yeah.
Um, just get some rest and call
me if you need anything.
I will. I will.
- You don't look good.
I'll be okay.
- Well, tonight was really
nice.
- Yeah.
I've learned that to be with
those I like is enough.
It's -- it's Walt Whitman.
- Yeah, I know.
What?
Nothing.
- No, what?
Uh...
I think, um...
I think I'm... Falling in love
with you.
Birdie, you're -- you're
amazing.
Good night.
Good night.
Holy shit.
She said she loved me.
Can you believe that?
How could she possibly say that
and mean it?
She loves me?
And she wants me to meet her
parents on Friday.
El, she doesn't even know me --
this girl.
Oh, man.
I am -- I am eating ice cream in
the middle of winter.
I'm quoting Whitman randomly.
If she thinks this is who I am,
she's in for a rude awakening.
That's all I can say.
I, uh -- I got to write a little
bit, but if you need me, I'll be
in my room.
Oh, how am I doing?
Oh, thanks so much for asking.
Oh.
Hello?
- Morning, sunshine.
Alan, hey.
What time is it?
Listen, it's early, but I
couldn't wait.
I got those pages you e-mailed
me.
Oh, yeah? You like?
- I likey very much.
I likey long time.
That's why I'm calling.
I'm calling to see if we can get
a pitch session set together to
come up with the ending and go
over some ideas for it.
Let's say next Friday at 6:00?
- Actually, you know, I-got
this dance-recital thing.
That's a good one.
But, seriously, how's Friday
gonna be -- next Friday?
- Uh, yeah, sure.
That'll work.
- All right. It's on.
I'm excited. That's great.
So, what are you doing tonight?
I'd like to get my guy a beer.
- You know, Alan, I can't.
My -- this girl I've been
seeing -- she's got this
surprise planned for us.
- All right.
Listen, I got to go.
I got to get back to writing,
but I'll see you next Friday.
- Okay. I'm psyched up.
I love you, pal.
- I love... You, too.
Triple x's, triple o's.
- You, too.
I'm so excited.
- Me, too.
Um, all right.
Now you have to close your eyes
till I tell you to open them.
- Really?
Yeah.
- Okay.
I might need some help.
- Yeah. I'll lead you.
Okay. Sorry.
- Already.
Here we go. Walk straight.
Okay.
All right. Open 'em.
Okay.
Wow.
Isn't this awesome?
My friend works here.
I had to promise my first-born
child to get the keys,
but... What do you think?
Those are Andrew Wyeths.
- I know.
He's my favorite artist.
- Yeah, I know.
Really?
- Yeah.
You know who mine is?
- No.
I don't have one.
Uh... Do you want some
bourbon?
No, I'm good.
- Really? Just a toast?
To what?
- I don't know. To us?
Do you have anything besides
bourbon?
No, no. This is all I have.
- Ahh.
Yeah, no. I'm good.
It's crazy.
My mom used to wear her hair in
braids just like this.
They call these the Helga
paintings.
Andrew's wife walked into his
studio one day and found like
240 paintings of this other
woman.
Turns out it was their next-door
neighbor Helga.
Well, life's a bitch.
God, I wish I could paint like
that.
I bet you could.
You're so talented.
Oh, okay.
Are you, uh -- are you
hungry?
You want some food?
I just ate. It's okay.
Sam, what's going on?
What do you mean?
- Do you want to be here right
now?
- What are you talking about?
Okay, I'm -- I'm just
starting to feel like some
annoying girl you just met that
you're trying to get rid of.
I-I-i have a lot of shit on
my mind, is all, but I'm making
a lot of headway with my
writing.
Really good stuff.
- "Teen vampire 2"?
Is that what you think?
You think I'm a hack writer,
don't you?
- No. No, no. God.
No, that's not what I meant.
- It's all right.
I get it.
You know, I-i kind of prefer
this to the Wyeths.
Is this because I-i told you
that I -- you know, about what I
said the other night?
- Come on.
I see what's going on here.
It's a little weird, don't you
think?
I mean, you invite me to this
private viewing of your favorite
artist's painting with your
favorite liquor and your
favorite bread and your favorite
cheese.
- If you're not into it, we
don't have to --
- no, no, no. I get it, okay?
I'm meat loaf, and you want
fucking filet mignon.
What are you even talking
about?
I'm exhausted!
The rock climbing, the guitar,
and the cooking!
- The cooking?
I'm just trying to keep up
with you, birdie, and it's not
easy.
- Okay, no.
I don't want you to keep up with
me, okay?
None of that stuff's important
to me.
Can I tell you something?
Honestly, I think you're better
off with someone else.
Like Tony -- outgoing, talented,
worldly.
He's perfect for you.
What?! No.
Tony is my friend, okay?
Dating the guy was a complete
nightmare.
You're being ridiculous.
- Am I really?
Who's my favorite author?
- I don't -- I don't know.
Carlos castaneda?
- No.
- What's my favorite dessert?
- - I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?
- See, don't you think it's
strange that you don't know
those things?
Uh, no.
Honestly, no.
There's a lot of stuff you don't
know about me, either.
But what's the point?
We are so different.
There's too much --
I barely traveled, and you're
like a fucking peace corps
veteran.
I don't even know --
- what do you see in me? Huh?
And what's to say you won't just
take off and leave whenever you
want?
That is kind of your philosophy,
right?
When life gives you something
better, you just -- you take
off.
Right?
That's what you think?
You think I'm just waiting
around till something better
comes along?
Well, I don't know.
You tell me.
That was the first time...
I've ever told a guy that I love
him.
Do you know how shitty it was
for me to get that response from
you?
- So, why are you here?
Because... Idiot...
I like you...
Whether you choose to believe it
or not.
So, if you don't think that I
know you because I don't know
what your fucking favorite
dessert is, then please tell me
so I can stop imagining that
this might actually go
somewhere.
sailor, if you take me out of
here, I'll do anything that you
the people down here, but I feel
Hey! Hey! Hold it!
Hold it! Fuck! Hey!
Thank you.
Hi. How are you? I have an --
- there he is.
Alan.
- The writing machine.
Hey.
- How you doing?
Good.
- I'm surprised you got any
blood in those fingers after all
the writing you've been doing.
Yeah.
- Get yourself in here.
Okay.
- You know my partner, Scott.
Yes. We spoke on the phone.
- How are you?
So nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Welcome. Sit down.
Like the man bag.
- Oh, thanks, Alan.
I like what it says about you.
Yeah?
- Hope there's a couple more
gems in that one.
- Well, me, too.
Help yourself to a pastry, a
little fruit.
No, thank you.
- Why don't you knock out a
cantaloupe?
You've been writing, cooped up.
It's got some micronutrients in
it.
Knock a cantaloupe out.
- Okay.
Yeah. Pop it in there.
Eat it.
Okay. So, as an overall,
general note, the
stream-of-consciousness
narration's working great.
Great.
- It is very clear that this
guy is beyond lost and has no
clue how to navigate his own
actions.
- Uh...
And what I like is he doesn't
understand how the real world
works...
- Right.
...and he's too afraid to
show himself to the real world,
and these are the seeds of his
own undoing.
Oh, I don't --
- he's a child.
He's wandering alone in the
woods -- right? -- Lost in the
ether of his own neuroses.
And this is powerful stuff.
Yeah. He's saying you wrote
the perfect pussy.
The perfect pussy?
- Yeah, the perfect pussy.
Now, around chapter 12 -- and
I'm sorry to interrupt -- but
it's at this point in the story
that it's pretty obvious that I
completely side with the girl.
- See, for me, it's more around
11 or 10.
- With the girl?
Are you kidding?
- Well, I think what you do is
great 'cause you have a
protagonist, and then you, like
a relay race, hand off the Baton
and say, "now we're gonna root"
for this girl."
And I think you do it in a way
that's elegant but, at the same
time, not subtle.
Yeah, and if I may, like, how
do you not love her?
And he is such a spineless,
pathetic --
he's a eunuch, is what he is.
- That's exactly --
I don't mean it literally,
'cause, clearly, they have --
there's scenes between them that
we know what we're talking
about, but he's a eunuch in more
ways than one.
I, uh --
- so, the point is --
do you feel what I'm saying,
though?
I do.
So, okay.
How would this metaphorical
eunuch be redeemable in her
eyes?
- Hold on, guys.
All due respect, this was not my
intention when I wrote the story
at all.
This was not what I was going
for.
- Come again.
Well, I mean, she's so
carried away with this whole
thing.
She's the one that puts pressure
on it.
She -- she makes it heavy.
No.
- How can you say that?
There's no real connection
between them.
It's not his fault.
- They were in love.
He just wasn't cognizant enough
to see it.
Exactly, and now all she can
do is accept the fact that he's
completely inept.
- That's right. He had it.
He lost it because he suffocated
her with his own fear.
In the end, I mean, it's
obvious that it can only be one
thing, and that's that he's
destined to be alone.
It's really honest, and it's
really simple.
Uh-huh.
He's cut everyone out.
He's gonna continue to do that.
He's gonna get over his issues
with his mom and all that stuff.
- He's gonna spend the rest of
his life crippled by the fact
that he wasn't able to show her
love.
And if he did wake up, it would
be a lot of substances and a lot
of years later.
Mm-hmm.
- And at that point, she would
have banged half of Manhattan,
so he wouldn't want her anyway,
so romance or no romance,
it's -- it's over with.
Yeah.
That was insane!
Mercedes and Roberto!
Hey! Taxi!
You better hang on to your
oxygen tanks, ladies and
gentlemen, because up next, we
have Henry and Harriet.
Cookie and Fritz, everybody!
Cookie and Fritz!
One more time!
We only have a few couples left.
On deck, the lovely birdie and
her companion, the delectable
Raymond.
But first, Earl and Sally, or,
as they're known collectively,
wow factor.
What are you guys doing here?
- What are you doing here?
We came to watch birdie dance.
Where is she?
- She's over there.
She's about to go on.
- Okay. Um...
Give me your stuff.
Give me your stuff.
Okay.
- Get yourself together.
Oh, my God. You look crazy.
- Huh? Oh, shoot.
Okay. Good?
- Get in there.
How are you guys doing?
- We're -- we're great.
Yeah.
- We're compromising.
Compromisers.
- That's great.
That's so good.
- Get in there.
All right. Okay.
Birdie.
Hi.
Hi.
- You look amazing.
Where -- where are your parents?
- Um, I-i called them off.
I didn't think you were coming.
- Great. Sorry.
Uh, can we go somewhere for a
second and just talk?
I-I need to...
We can talk right here.
I love you.
- Oh, Sam, you -- you don't
have to --
- I know. I know.
But I-i-i do.
I am in love with you.
I love you so much.
It feels really good to say.
I'm sorry I didn't say it the
other day, but I didn't know if
I knew in the right way, but now
I know that I knew in every way.
I knew it. I know it, you know?
Does that make any sense?
Not really.
Okay, wait. Um...
The guy that you fell in love
with --
- you.
No, the guy who, like, plays
guitar and likes pedicures and,
uh, is thinking about getting a
tattoo -- that's not entirely
who I am.
I... Based all that on your
Facebook page because I-i wanted
to be your ideal guy.
I know.
What?
- I know.
You're not exactly the most
subtle guy in the world, Sam.
You knew the whole time?
- Yeah.
"The origin of species"?
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I-i didn't want to put myself
out there and not have a
connection.
I was so afraid.
But it's there.
It's been there the whole time.
Can we please start over,
birdie?
But we can pick up where we left
off.
Oh, thank you.
I can't believe you knew about
the profile thing and you didn't
tell me.
- Yeah. I even -- I even
started putting stuff on there
just to see if you would do it.
Are you kidding?
- No. Like the rock climbing?
What? That was the worst!
- That was the worst!
You're the worst!
Hey, can I tell you something
now?
I should come clean with this.
I was actually making up the
whole male-a-cappella-group
thing.
- Mm. Nice try.
Ladies and gentlemen, I
believe we have a change in the
roster this evening.
Scratch Raymond.
- This dance will be birdie
and...
Whoever you are.
May I have this dance?
- Yes.
What the fuck?!
- Oh, Raymond, I'm so sorry.
Let me explain.
My girlfriend didn't know I was
coming to this thing 'cause I'm
kind of a jackass.
You better watch out.
If you ever leave her side
again, I'm swooping in!
Don't worry about that.
So...
Did you finish your book?
Almost.
But I think the ending's about
