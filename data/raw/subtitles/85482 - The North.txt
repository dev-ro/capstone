Arturo, do you want to meet tonight?
By the old hacienda.
Goodbye, Rosita.
Goodbye.
Rosa, get away from that house!
Yes mother, I'm coming.
Don't disturb the old sisters.
Leave them alone.
The door was open.
I thought I was allowed to see them.
Just when you don't expect it.
Help me. Your father and brother are coming.
You are a wise man.
You know that Arturo Xuncax
is not your friend.
None of them are your friends.
They don't respect the traditions.
They only want to destroy you.
Think about that!
Think about your family.
Tell me where they are to meet.
With the old hacienda tonight.
I love Don Goyos music.
Come and have a seat.
Is Pedro and Josefita comming?
Yes, soon.
Arturo... do you have to leave tonight?
Yes, I have to.
That’s the old house.
We are walking from here. Spread around.
In USA,
even the poorest people can afford
toilets like those of Don Rodigros.
You flush,
and everything disappears in a blink.
You can pee with style.
Can't you talk about anything
else than ''the north''?
I love to hear about it.
Good, cause we hear about it often.
But it's true
that there is allot of money there.
Everyone who knows people who has
traveled there, tells about it.
And you can see it on TV.
That’s right.
Even the poorest have their own car.
How do you know so much about it?
Don Rodrigos cook
have given me
her old magazines.
And I've read them for over 10 years.
That’s why I know so much.
Can I leave the table?
Yes.
Lovers?
Really? How romantic.
How are you, Rosita?
Good, Luis.
I have some cinnamon-candy for you.
Thanks, I love those.
I'm leaving now.
Stay here and enjoy yourself.
Why are you leaving?
It's too late.
I have to go.
Lupe, take it easy .
He can take care of himself.
Come here and take a seat
with us.
Good night, Rosita .
Good night.
Dad!
Mom is afraid.
Do you have to leave tonight?
Your mother knows how it is.
She don't want any trouble.
I understand that, but
it can't continue like this anymore.
I'm also afraid.
Me too.
But some times there is not another
option than to fight for your country.
The rich ones came here. They aren't
from here. They just wanted good land.
Nobody searches for bad land.
That’s why they took our land.
They settled down
cause the land was good!
Let me tell you something, Enrique,
that life has thought me.
I've worked in Mexico,
and I've worked at the plantations.
I've worked allot of places,
and it's always the same story.
For the rich, farmers are only
hands that can do their job.
They treat their animals
better than us.
We have tried to get the rich
to understand for a long time
that we poor have a heart and a soul.
That we have feelings.
We are people like them.
Dad.
Let me come with you.
No, Enrique.
Your time will come...
but not now.
Go tell your mother that she don't
need to be concerned. I'll be back soon.
Where do we get the weapons from?
Smuggled through Chiapas.
The guerilla at the coast is helping us.
Yes, he's right...
Protect him, holy mother of God.
Arturo is right.
We have to organize and fight.
Run!
Forward.
That Indian bastard killed Puma.
that’s not true
that we come here for living
we only come to sleep
and dream
everything is only lent
we are only on earth for a while
tomorrow or the day after
as You wish, the Creator of Life
we are returning to You
Mom...
Mom...mom!
Good, take away that awful thing!
My mom, my mom.
Where is my mom?
Sit down! Sit!
We can take care of you.
You can stay with us.
Forget about her. The army has taken her.
No, my mother! That’s not true!
And Enrique?
We don't know.
The soldiers are coming! Dad!
The soldiers are coming!
Quick! We have to hide her!
Rosita! Hide yourself!
They are driving!
Dad, they are driving!
They are driving! Mom! Dad!
They are driving!
Rosa.
I thought they had taken you.
I hid in the ditch.
I was so afraid.
I heard gunshots all the time.
Mom. . . mom. . .
They took her.
Yes, I know.
The soldiers are coming back, Enrique.
I'm afraid,
and people are leaving the village.
I have to leave too.
As long as I'm here,
I put all of you in danger.
Are you leaving?
Where?
North.
North.
But I don't have any money.
Ask your if your godmother
want to help you.
I'll see you tomorrow night at our place.
Be careful.
Don Ramón!
So, you are alive.
Unbelievable.
I hid in the ditch .
Come, we have to go.
You know what’s going on.
I need help.
Your life is not worth shit
right now
They will come for you.
Today, tomorrow, and the day after.
They will hunt you down and get you.
It's impossible to get away.
Only in your imagination.
I'm leaving. I'm going north.
That’s why I've come.
You have been there, you can help me.
It's a long journey.
You need money and better
luck than until now.
You need the protection of
God and the saints.
But I suppose you have to go.
Cause if you stay,
you can only hide from the army
if you become a small bug.
Mija, what shall we do?
Enrique's life is in danger here.
Enrique is leaving.
He's going north.
And I'm going with him.
North?
Is everything planned?
We don't have any money godmother.
Can't you help us?
Of course.
Just a minute.
Rosita, I've always
wanted to go north.
Since I was a little girl.
But I don't go.
I'm to old now.
Here is the money that
I've collected.
Now you can go north for me.
Remember that it's illegal for
you to stay in Mexico.
If they catch you without papers,
and you are returned home,
they're going to kill you.
It's hard to be a Mexican.
Use your head before you loose it.
You have to talk like a Mexican.
Tell me that it's warm.
It is... It's warm.
You aren't getting further
than Chiapas.
Say that it's damn warm today.
Mexicans always swear.
Damn that and damn this.
Swear all the time,
or else they will find you.
And if they ask where you're from,
tell them you're from Oaxaca .
Most people can't tell the difference.
They think all Indians look the like.
Do you know a good guide?
Yes, a good one.
Without him, you won't make it over.
And remember that the border between
Mexico and USA is like a war zone.
Remember that... remember that.
Rosa.
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
Like the situation is now?
And you're a woman.
And you're a man.
You are getting killed here nevertheless.
But it's so dangerous.
Ramón says it's like a war.
Maybe I won't make it.
And with you...
My sister is crazy, everybody is crazy.
There is no other way out.
Don't you think the soldiers will
capture you when they come back?
I’m so afraid, Enrique.
And money to cross the border?
What about your lover?
The past is gone forever.
I've lost my mother and my father.
And the time I thought
you were gone.
I've never felt so alone.
I wont let you leave me.
We have to be together,
even if we are alive or dead.
You are all my family now.
You're right, Rosita .
We have to be together, but
we wont die
We'll live!
They won't follow us up north.
I'll earn allot of money, so that
we can get everything we want.
And we'll be back one day.
We get the luck on our side now.
Be sure of that.
Wait, there is something I have to do.
What?
I have to do it alone. Meet me
around the outskirts of the village.
Ok, but hurry.
I will.
For my father.
For my mother.
And for my village.
Rosa.
Where are you heading, Rosa?
Rosa, where are you going?
Where are you heading?
Where are you going, Rosa?
Rosa, what is it?
Nothing. But hurry.
So, lets go north.
That damn tire!
Lousy tire!
Damn!
What a piece of shit!
What the hell?
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your tongue?
Bums. Where are you going?
In which direction are you going?
Same direction as you. Same
direction? Where are you from?
From Oa xaca.
From Oa xaca? Shit!
So, you are from Oa xaca?
You are really crazy.
That’s where we're heading.
Idiots!
Oaxaca is 300 km ahead of us.
You're from Guatemala, right?
Got you there.
Help me fix the tire,
and I'll give you a ride.
How did you cross the border?
It's cramped with soldiers there.
Yes, but Enrique knows
the trails in the mountain.
Have you been smuggling?
Do you like Mexican music?
Yes, I like it very much.
It's the best kind!
Hey, idiot. Move your ass.
That’s the reason.
I can't handle that draft!
Damn Indians! You should have
died in a ditch for that!
Old idiot.
Enrique Xuncax!
Enrique Xuncax!
You won't get away this time,
you little shit!
Well, this is Tijuana alright.
The world's sewer.
Come, I have a good guide.
He only takes 50.000 pesos.
Come again. I'm brave. I'll
guide you through this.
Get north without troubles with me.
Come with! We're leaving for
the north! Come with!
I take 50.000 pesos for each head!
The best for the poor!
Come one people, north!
There you won't be sleeping
on the floor anymore.
Not like here in Mexico,
where you'll die of hunger.
Come with me to the land of money
with beautiful houses and cars.
There where everything is beautiful.
Come with me north!
What a bunch of idiots. Don't know
the difference between ass and hole.
They are as stupid as animals.
What's going on here?
Jaime, those fools came now.
They are looking for their guide,
but they don't have the address.
They think they are still in the village.
Such fools.
It's a pity that they aren't as
wise as you geniuses.
If you're so smart,
what are you doing in Tijuana?
Come on. Get away!
Leave them alone . Come on!
Don't mind those idiots. Just
arrived? Where are you from?
We're from Oa xaca .
I'm from Zacatecas.
I'm Jaime.
And my name is Enrique.
This is my sister Rosa .
Good day.
Who are you looking for?
Raimundo Gutierrez.
It's a friend of a person in our village.
Do you have his address?
Yes... we had.
But he don't live there anymore.
Ok... Do you have any money?
Well... Yes.
Allot?
Yes, I believe so.
Let me give you an advice.
Don't give them to anyone.
You'll get use of them when you
get north. Do you understand?
I want to help concerning your friend,
but I'm crossing the border tonight.
You can stay and look for him,
or you can try your luck with me.
Yes please, we would like that.
Believe me, it's not that hard.
Do you want a place to stay until then?
Yes, if we're going tonight.
You can stay here.
What if the owner comes?
Rosa, look around.
It's a ''lost city'' .
People comes and goes. Nobody knows or
cares of how may there are here.
And nobody owns something here.
I'll get you at twilight. And then
we'll cross the border, ok?
I'll see you later.
I'll see you tonight.
I told you that we were lucky.
Imagine meeting someone like him
our first day here.
You're easily impressed.
And you can't see the luck
right in front of you.
It's so warm and dusty.
It's not like San Pedro here.
Are you feeling homesick?
Would you rather be in San Pedro?
I just said that it was very warm.
I'm not homesick.
I don't think about San Pedro,
cause if you do, you'll get mad.
Then let us not talk about it.
Sleep, since you won't be able to tonight.
Rosa, do you think all those people
tries to get north like us?
Yes, I think so.
It's allot of people.
Sleep now.
Think about it, and you'll get insane
faster than if you think of San Pedro.
You're so practical, Rosa .
Sleep.
Here's the hole.
Careful. Be silent as a ghost.
I'll be there in a moment.
Wait here.
He's only peeing.
Robbing you is really a bother.
You're an asshole.
How much dough do you have?
Dough?
Dough! Don't you speak Spanish?
1500 pesos.
What? Fuck.
You said that you had much.
It is much.
Go to hell!
I've broken my balls for
some lousy 1500 pesos. Shit.
Oaxaca, Mexico.
Yes, also Oaxaca .
Can you read and write?
Why is he asking that?
I don't know.
But I think it's a trap.
We better lie.
What are we going to do with you?
No, we can't read, nor write.
Then show me where you're from.
What the hell?
What the hell are you showing me?
What the hell are you talking about?
Bananas! How many do you want?
Fresh bread ! Bananas!
How many do you want?
Freshly baked bread!
Bananas! Hot tamales!
Hello! Damn thief!
Help! Police!
Lazy animals, what are you doing?
I'm looking for Raimundo Gutierre.
I'm Raimundo.
I want to get north.
You're waiting your time.
I've quit, it's to dangerous.
I will not help anyone over anymore! No one!
I'm a friend of Ramón Muño.
He gave me your name.
You would think
you haven't eaten for a week.
But your lucky. Your alive.
Do you want to help us?
Ramón is a good friend.
I owe him a couple of favors.
So it seems I have to help you.
But I guess you don't have much money.
I wont demand much.
I'll do it for Ramón.
But there is allot of expenses.
How much?
About 100 dollar.
That's for gasoline, food, hotel...
Take it easy. We'll gather the founds.
Your sister... is she strong?
Stronger than both of us.
Good. Cause I wont lead you through
the mountains.
That route has become to dangerous.
There is another way.
The pipes... and that is terrible.
The old sewer pipelines lead from
Tijuana to the other side.
They haven't been used in years,
so they are empty.
The most secure are the small ones,
but you'll have to crawl
several kilometers.
It's safer than the mountains,
but it's a hell.
Yoy can neither hear or see.
And the stench...
It's safer.
But most prefer to
go over the mountains
and risk getting robbed
or shot.
Rosa.
Look what I have.
Fruit and a bun to you.
I have something for you too. A steak.
Where is it from?
I've eaten a fairly large lunch
with Raimundo Gutierre.
You found him.
Yes, and he agreed to help us over the border.
It's just one thing.
We have to get 100 dollar.
It's real silver.
It will get us the money.
Moms necklaces.
No, we can't sell those.
Enrique...
If we are to get north...
... is there no other way out.
It will look like you're never
getting out.
But you'll have to
go on even further.
I'll be waiting in the other
end. I promise.
walk, my children.
May the Virgin watch over you.
What is it?
I think it's a dead cat.
Come on.
Rosa, are you ok?
Yes, Enrique.
We need to continue.
I can spot the end!
It's me.
Raimundo.
Of course. I told you I would
be here as promised.
I have some sandwiches.
You have a first class guide.
Rosita, come here.
It's San Diego.
Nice, isn't it?
It's easy from here.
We'll be in Los Angeles tomorrow.
I know.
Quite simple.
But very comfortable
and very safe.
Rosa, I'll come for you tomorrow.
Yes.
Good. Goodnight.
Bye.
Josefita was right.
There is water closets here.
And we have electrical light.
Now we just need to buy a
new car without money.
Josefita and her crazy stories.
Come on!
Come on!
She's new here. You'll teach her.
Show her how you iron.
Do you want me to show her? Ok.
Just like you.
Yes, Take it easy.
Ok, come with.
The same way.
Yes. Ok, Mr. Chung.
What's your name?
I'm Nacha.
When you're about to iron, look for
the piece of paper that says ''to be pressed''.
Tear it off and keep it.
They'll pay you 30 cent a piece.
Do you understand And be careful.
It's a steam ironer. Watch out.
