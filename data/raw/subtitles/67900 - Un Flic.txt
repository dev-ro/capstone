"The only two feelings...
...men give rise to...
...are ambiguity and derision."
A COP
Every afternoon, at the same time...
...I started my cruise
by the Champs-Elysées.
Car 8, listening.
Here he is.
Yes... Where's that?
I'm on my way. I'll call you back.
I was on duty just before nightfall.
But it was only
when the town was asleep...
...that I could really work.
My name's Edouard Coleman.
Step back.
Step back, I said!
This is a hold-up, nobody move!
You, there!
Drop the other bag!
Keep your hats on.
Three tickets to Paris.
Within one hour...
...l won't have a drop of blood left.
Within one hour,
you'll be in the hospital...
...and this will be only a memory.
If they don't follow the Paris clue
and set a roadblock...
...Marc will get out.
We'll pass the roadblock...
...and pick him up later.
That's the only way.
No, Paul, we'll do as I say.
Car 8. Here he is.
Yes.
Where's that?
I'm on my way. I'll call you back.
Get a move on,
there's nothing to see.
Your register.
I haven't recopied his form yet.
Give me that form.
I can't find it.
Is that so?
You'll see that with
the Lodgings Department.
They'll have some work!
Please, Madam.
Go to bed, Sir.
Pacinelli!
So you're playing cards here?
Just a little poker,
and we were going.
You'll go only after
Homicide has heard you.
Car 8. Here he is.
Yes.
Where's that?
I'm on my way. I'll call you back.
We're doomed victims...
...the preys of actual pros.
They tell us they're of age...
...they rob us.
Then they show us
their identity card.
And we can't lodge complaints...
...we'd be charged
with debauching minors.
Which we call "misdemeanour".
You're sentenced only if you relapse.
We all do.
If the man hadn't yelled and
if the porter hadn't caught you...
...that Maillol would be far now.
I don't want to be hard on him.
How old are you?
1 7, and 6 months.
Only 6 months left...
...if the Judge doesn't convict you.
Got your papers?
Sir.
- Is this your current residence?
- No, I'm living with a friend.
Of course.
Well?
Hardly a chance.
She's just arrived. Over there.
I'm coming!
How are you?
Well?
It'll be the Paris-Lisbon train.
With the help of a customs man.
By day or night?
Don't know yet.
About when?
They'll send the goods
right away to Paris.
Sure your guy alone
is entrusted with it?
Quite.
He's paid well enough for that.
And he lives luxuriously.
You know his name?
Only his nickname:
Suitcase Matthew.
He's a professional smuggler.
- If it turns well, we'll let you be.
- Thank you, Edouard.
- You'll see them, Chief?
- Yes.
The eternal trio!
The jostler, the picker and the runner.
Where were they working?
Orly Airport, of course.
This one hustled...
...a passenger
putting his wallet away.
That one picked the wallet...
...and passed it
to the third who scrammed.
They don't understand French.
Okay.
If they can't understand French
I'll speak another language.
Wait a minute!
Speak slowly and we'll understand.
How did it go?
Are you tired?
Think you'll get the job?
I hope so.
It's easier, in the country.
They don't think
a man of 60 is useless.
And Staff Manager
in a Strasbourg bank...
...is as good as
sub-manager in Paris.
DEADLY HOLD-UP
AT ST-JEAN-DE-MONTS
The gangsters fled by train.
Hello, Mr. Inspector.
Hello, Mr. Inspector.
Someone to see you, Chief.
How are you?
Okay.
Every hospital and clinic
will surely be thoroughly searched.
They know a man
has been wounded.
We must retrieve Marc at once.
And if we don't succeed?
I've another solution.
Rapid fire doesn't follow normal rules.
Don't let the target out of your sight.
Forget the aiming.
First important point: the coat.
Make your pocket heavy
with keys or a lighter.
Mr. Coleman! Telephone.
Too bad.
Tomorrow?
We're here to get Mr. Schmidt.
What for?
He's to be taken to
Lariboisiére Hospital.
Who signed your paper?
Schmidt.
Post-operative congestion
of the lungs, comatose condition.
Not fit to travel.
But it's signed,
Professor Durieux.
Professor Durieux should know...
...you can't move a man
in his condition.
Durieux or not Durieux,
I don't care!
We have orders.
And I'm telling you, he's not leaving.
H.Q. has very few means
to figure out who Schmidt was.
Through his identity Card,
if he had one.
Or if he had been arrested,
at least once.
Yes. Otherwise, nothing.
He'll remain an anonymous corpse
unless our Providence intervenes.
A phone call, an unsigned letter.
This job makes us sceptical.
Especially about scepticism.
The only two feelings men
give rise to in us detectives...
...are ambiguity and derision.
Derision...
Rapid, handy, in fine condition...
...entirely equipped.
As I need at least
two week's training...
...it's very urgent.
How will you pay?
Come back here in 2 hours.
You're under arrest.
- How did you find me?
- It's my job.
A dead man can't arrest people.
Don't you think
Simon suspects something?
He doesn't suspect, he knows.
- For a long time?
- He's always known.
This will be a non-stop drive.
500 miles to go
and unearth the loot.
- The numbers?
- Haven't been picked up.
The money arrives on Thursdays...
...for the companies
to pay their workers on Fridays.
The constructions are so numerous...
...they'd need an army of clerks
to pick up numbers.
That's why I wanted extra security.
The success of
our second job is at stake.
A lot of money needs to be put up.
A trifle, compared to
what it'll bring us.
The goods will be entrusted
to Suitcase Matthew.
But only at Bordeaux this time.
They're more and more prudent.
We interfere between
Bordeaux and the border.
It's the oldest electrified line: 1923.
The whole substructure
is to disappear...
...and be replaced by a new one.
Between Lamothe
and Morceux, 43 miles...
...where the train runs at 100 mph...
...usually.
But owing to the works...
...it won't go over
36 mph during 18 miles.
Count 3 miles lost after the bend...
...and another 3 lost before Morceux
to be on the safe side.
Then we'll dispose of 20 minutes.
And when the goods are ours...
...the very men we robbed...
...will buy them back.
No complaint lodged...
...no detectives on our heels.
I'm coming!
Set for the 2nd.
The Paris-Lisbon train...
...leaving at 11:59p.m.
Arriving Bordeaux: 5:43 a.m.
The goods will be
delivered to him there.
I'll have him followed.
The Hendaye customs
officer is in on it.
Get the number of his sleeper.
Easy!
The Manager will see me pretty late.
I'll take a night train.
And I'll be here in the morning.
You'd better rest awhile.
Sleep in Strasbourg.
No, I hate day journeys.
The three of us
will be back here at 8 a.m.
- Just you three in the know?
- No...
The four of us.
Sure you considered every risk?
I did.
Every risk.
Paul and Louis will never talk?
No one will ever talk!
Am I disturbing you?
You've never disturbed me.
Come and have a drink.
You too.
Three scotches.
Passengers for Lisbon,
via Bordeaux, Bayonne, Hendaye...
...Irun, San Sebastian, Burgos...
...all aboard!
Bordeaux stop. The Lisbon train
steams into station.
Five minutes' stop!
Phone Bayonne, the goods arrived.
Keep watching N9 in Car 8.
Follow the operation by telephone.
I'm leaving for Paris by train.
I hate to drive in the fog.
My regards to inspector LeMoüel.
In 10 minutes,
the train goes through Morceux.
Difficult to sleep, Sir.
How right you are!
You want her?
What's up?
What's the matter?
What have I done?
Stand up.
Stand up, or I'll hit!
I wonder why I don't.
Why that phoney tip?
What's your game?
I don't understand.
You will. And soon!
First, cut your hair. You damn fairy!
From now on, dress as a man.
- What was your game, you dope?
- I don't get you, Edouard.
Mr. Inspector.
Mr. Inspector, I don't understand.
When Matthew was nabbed
at Hendaye...
...he had neither of his 2 suitcases.
Do you hear me?
I'll charge you with being a fag
cruising the streets.
You'll get 6 months.
Then you'll do your job correctly.
That of informer, not the other.
Take "that" away!
- To the depot?
- No, to the gutter!
I got info about the man
at the morgue.
His name's Marc Albouis.
Wasn't he a friend of Louis Costa's?
- Let's ask Homicide.
- What?
To know whether he was
at St-Jean-de-Monts.
Interested?
No. Just to know, as you said.
Well, just take care of "our" job.
Is Simon in?
Coleman speaking.
I'll call later.
Put me through to the Director.
It's inspector Coleman.
Yes... I'll hold.
Mr. Director, this is Coleman.
Please don't disclose
Albouis' identity.
I'm too late?
No... thank you.
Nothing else.
Nothing else...
Was the dead man involved...
...in the St-Jean-de-Monts case?
Mr. John...
...for you!
The car... quick!
Get a car,
I'll need three of you.
Thanks.
On December 23rd...
...you committed a hold-up.
What?
A hold-up.
With three accomplices.
You'd say anything!
I won't ask about him.
The papers say that his name...
...was Marc Albouis.
You can't make...
...any connection between
me and a man I never saw.
Forget the past.
I want you to tell me, and fast...
...very fast...
...the names of the two others.
That's all.
You're talking seriously?
You'll soon find out.
I don't need details about the hold-up.
But on the other hand, I repeat...
...that you'll tell me right away...
...the names of your two accomplices.
You really think...
...that if I were guilty of anything...
...I'd rat on my accomplices?
Want to bet?
He'll never talk.
What do you think?
Evening, Mr. Inspector.
Good evening.
2 Scotches.
- You knew Marc Albouis?
- Who?
Marc Albouis.
And Paul Weber?
Nope.
An ex-Assistant Bank Manager...
...who was jobless.
No. Not at all.
And Louis Costa?
Wait a minute... Costa.
No... I don't know him.
But he knows you.
Paul! Louis talked.
Impossible!
Yes, Paul, it's possible.
Take off at once!
What's the use, Simon?
They're here already.
I'm awfully sorry, Paul.
Really.
See you later.
You open the door.
We're trying.
Come and pick me up at once.
Make sure no one follows you.
Don't move, Simon.
Don't move, Simon.
No weapon.
Didn't you fire a bit too fast?
I wasn't sure if
he would commit suicide.
What about his suitcase?
A gift for inspector LeMoüel.
Take it to him.
Car 8 listening. Here he is.
Yes... Where's that?
I'm on my way. I'll call you later.
