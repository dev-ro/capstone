PART 1
GUARD DOGS
Can't sleep, Mum?
He will keep on barking.
l know.
Take something to make you sleep.
You have a full day tomorrow.
l'll stay here for a while.
All right then, good night.
Wake up, we gotta get up.
There's the armadillo, the lion...
Tons of stuff.
Oh, God.
Mariá, stay there.
Stay here.
Last night's breath.
- lt's all right.
- ls it?
Yours is all right.
Good morning kids, welcome
to another Happy Morning.
You know the drill,
lots of fun and cartoons...
- Mariá.
- João, good morning.
- You smell good.
- Get away, boy.
- How are you?
- l'm all right.
- This is Sofia.
- Hello, Sofia.
All right?
- Do you have any coffee?
- Sure, fresh.
l need it.
Great.
You know Sofia used to
live right here on the street?
Oh, yeah? She's probably part of the family.
Careful there, you could be
brother and sister.
We're not brother and sister, Mariá.
l've only lived here six months.
Only six months, why?
At the time, my mother died
and l was sent to live with my uncle.
But he doesn't live here anymore.
You are too young to be an orphan, Sofia.
João, l brought the girls because
their mother went to the doctor.
l saw them, no problem.
No problem.
- When did you live here?
- ln 1 990.
l was already working here in 1 990.
For his parents.
- And his brother and sister.
- You have a brother and a sister?
Jesus, you know each other well, huh?
Mariá...
Look at her face.
"Ana Cecília Pinto: Pretty Ana Cecília Pinto,
heiress of Pinto Engineering,
"has just turned fifteen.
"She celebrated with a gang bang
sponsored by mummy and daddy
"who wished to see
their little girl all sore and swollen."
What are you saying, João?
lt's right here.
l just added that extra flavor.
l don't care, João.
Mariá, Mariá...
She's pretty. A bit sad looking.
Mariá is a bit sad, herself.
She's usually more cheery.
She's missing me already.
lt's her last week here.
- l'm old. He's retiring me.
- How old are you?
- l'm turning 60.
- You are not old, Mariá.
Adailton says a window was smashed
on the car parked outside overnight.
ls it a white Uno?
Fuck.
The window was left intact.
Yeah, a very nice thief.
Take a look inside.
- Yeah, they took the CD player.
- That's all?
Six books, they took none of them.
lt doesn't have an alarm?
Yes, but it doesn't work.
Will l see you again after this?
Maybe.
Do you want me to go
with you to the garage?
No, just help me with the window.
l have to go.
Okay. You have my number?
- Yes. Do you have mine?
- Yep.
Hey, Adailton!
Hey. All right?
Good morning.
Hi, Pacote.
Hey, brother! Can you turn that down?
Hey, brother!
Do you know anything about the car there?
Who might have done it?
l know nothing.
- Haven't heard.
- Nothing, zilch? You heard nothing.
Adailton, wasn't it you who called Mariá?
l called 'cause l saw the car
with the window messed up,
all fucked up. Somebody had to call.
How did you know it was
somebody staying with me?
Everaldo, the night guy, he came
and said, you know, this and that.
Then he, sort of, went...
You're a brother,
we saw the connection
and thought you should know, that's all.
But we know nothing of what
goes on, on this street.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- Was it Dinho? lt looks like his handiwork.
- Who?
l said it looks like Dinho's handiwork.
You are saying that.
Don't put no words in our mouths.
We are here to work, and not stick
noses into people's business.
And l ain't no rat.
Good morning, Romualdo.
Put it over there, will you?
Thank you.
Yansan could not bear children.
To make babies, Yansan
was told to prepare an...
Hi. How are you?
- Saying "good morning" to the car?
- Yeah, well...
- All right?
- All right.
- How's everything?
- Everything's great.
Except that my friend's car
got burgled in front of my building.
- Shit, really?
- Yeah.
You think Dinho might have
anything to do with it?
Yeah, well...
- l'll have a word with him to find out.
- The stereo was taken?
Yeah, CD player. Same old story.
Just keep me out of all
matters concerning Dinho.
- l know. You have the keys?
- Yeah.
All right.
The building has 24-hour video surveillance.
The perimeter fence
is equipped with sensors.
- How much is the service tax?
- R$450.
We have two parking
spaces for each apartment.
- How many cars do you own?
- None, at the moment.
We used to have two.
Modern, isn't it? Looks like a factory.
Please go in.
There's this huge living room,
and the view is quite nice.
1 80 square meters.
- Four en-suite bedrooms.
- Four en-suites.
Power is out right now.
- Anything wrong?
- No, it's temporary.
Let's go over to the kitchen.
And of course, the maid's room,
with a window.
Hot.
Throw me the ball!
Come with me,
you make me nervous out here.
- But his football fell...
- Never mind.
Throw back the ball!
ls it true a woman died in
the building yesterday?
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Was it suicide?
l'm not sure what happened,
but it seems she threw herself, yes.
Oh, God. That's a bad omen.
lt might sound strange,
but when l heard about this,
l almost called to cancel this visit.
Something negative about
living in the building struck me.
Would you consider a special arrangement
considering the circumstances?
l don't really see your point.
Yeah, well. lt might sound strange,
but l felt this... negative energy.
Look, the incident has no effect
on the quality of this place.
This place is not haunted.
You wouldn't put a word in...
All right then.
Flower wreaths downstairs.
l'm not interested, okay? Let's go.
What are you looking for?
Oh, nothing.
What are you doing?
Just spying on something.
What's going on?
Have you drugged the dog?
Unbelievable.
He's going to be fine. He's breathing.
1 02, Mrs. Beatriz Linhares.
Coming!
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mrs. Beatriz Linhares.
lt's me, 1 02. That way.
Good morning. l live up the street
and we bought one of these.
- Are you delivering it?
- What is your name?
lt should be in my husband's
name, Adalberto Gois.
Can you finish with me and
take care of her problem later?
Right here. Adalberto Gois will be next.
That's great.
lt's a 32-inch, a smaller one, right?
So, we'll be there in no time.
Get off me, Betânia!
What happened to your hair?
- Crazy Betânia attacked me again.
- Again?
Over here, please.
- Upstanding, please.
- Upstanding how?
Vertically.
- lt's the right way up.
- No, vertical, like this.
Like this.
- Just turn it, turn it.
- Turn it, man.
Glass of water, Mum.
What are you staring at, Fernanda?
- Where do l sign?
- Right here.
- Are you okay? Drink your water.
- You want some water?
- No, thanks.
- No, thanks.
Drink your glass of water
to calm you down.
Hold this, dear.
lt's all right, the crazy woman is my sister.
l apologize for the...
Nelson, will you go with them?
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
l see.
So you have this problem.
Need a hand, lady?
- No, l'm already paying your friend.
- l'm not asking for money...
Wow.
lt's easy, l'm telling you.
lt's easy, come on,
open my laptop, first file...
The tab's open, right?
Oh, dear.
Just go over to my desk and open the file.
The first one.
lt's like new, miss.
Of course l'm pissed off, Ricardo.
One more reason for you to come in early.
lt's a huge box.
Yeah, l'll try. Kisses. Bye.
Mum, do you really have to smoke in here?
Oh please, Fernanda...
Your class starts at 1 1 :00, in an hour.
Go take a shower.
- Met this girl last night.
- Oh yeah?
Sofia, the one l told you about earlier
with the stolen CD player.
What is she like?
l really liked her, she's cool.
Came over with friends,
- and she ended up staying.
- She stayed?
- A girlfriend, then.
- Friend, last night, you know, a friend.
What about this thing you
mentioned back there, let's hear it.
Remember l had to show this couple
the Vivaldi 301 last Monday?
- On Monday, l remember.
- You remember.
- So l went.
- And what happened?
What happened?
Man, the guy's wife was this girl
l knew way back in 1 981 .
Man, listen,
sex with this girl was spectacular.
We got along great, but sexually...
We fucked so much, any way we could,
any time we could.
- Oh yeah?
- lt was great.
This girl took a big chunk
out of my love life.
Get it?
l see a smile.
She called me yesterday, right here.
On Monday, you behaved like strangers?
As if you didn't know each other?
Didn't say hello, nothing like that?
- Go on with the story.
- To make a long story short,
she told me she's happy,
her marriage was a bit shaky...
Has two kids...
And everything's tip-top, so she said.
What is it?
Right, but that's it?
That's it? Didn't you find it... Come on...
Yeah, well, it's a good story.
- lsn't it?
- lt's good.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Seu Anco?
- Yes.
- My name is Clodoaldo Pereira dos Anjos.
- Good to meet you.
- What's your name?
- João.
There you are, Seu João,
pleased to meet you.
These men over there work with me.
We're calling on every house on the
street and l'll tell you why.
To offer you a private security
service for the street, okay?
We are trained in security firms,
here is our leaflet.
How do we work? We work with prevention.
To guarantee your peace of mind.
How do we do it?
We work from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
That's 1 2 hours of exclusive security,
covering the entire street.
But who sent you here?
We came ourselves.
We observed the street lacked security,
and this is exactly what we have to offer.
- Clodoaldo, right?
- That's correct.
Clodoaldo, take a good look at my house.
My house is the only one on the street,
maybe in the whole block,
without any fancy security gear.
Can you see that, Clodoaldo?
l had noticed that, yes.
Mr. Anco, l think you have
some cool house.
Wouldn't it be great if
the whole street was like this?
But violence doesn't let you.
Please allow me, but l saw you have
a video camera right there.
Clodoaldo, that's a small detail.
We have to do something.
What we propose is a R$20 collaboration
fee, a kind of partnership.
- l see...
- l agree with you...
What if someone chooses not to
pay the tax or collaborate?
No problem.
- l'm suddenly less safe?
- Absolutely no problem...
- lt's not a question of money.
- No problem, Mr. João.
l understand perfectly.
My father used to say we all have
the right to choose what to believe in.
Do you carry weapons, Clodoaldo?
To be honest, l can't really say yes,
and l can't really say no.
But l'll show you our best weapon,
which is this,
a cell phone.
Me and the boys
have all the contacts we need.
So, worst-case scenario, you throw
the mobile at the bad guy, is that it?
- Mr. João, please...
- Then you run home and get the real thing.
- l'm just trying to work out...
- l get it, l get it.
l offer a service, you accept it if you so wish.
My job here is to present it to you.
Obviously, you're important
people here on the street.
Just so you know, everybody's in
all the way to the clinic, except you.
Have you talked to Seu Francisco?
Francisco, your father?
You already know he's my father?
An important man like him?
Of course, a popular man on the street.
l'll have a word with him
to set things straight.
Grandpa will like that.
You have our leaflet,
and l'll also leave you my card.
lf you need anything, coming home
late one night...
lf you get a bad feeling about anything,
just call, we'll be there.
No strings attached, though it's
only R$20 a month. lf not, fine.
- All right? Thank you for your time.
- All right.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
What a pitch.
Let's get some coffee.
Hey, João.
Dinho.
What a great visit.
- How are you?
- All right.
What's up, man? You miss Germany?
Man, l miss it, actually...
Seven years is quite a long time.
lt is.
How's uncle and aunt, Mirela?
Everybody's fine.
Mirela's dating these loser types.
What can l do?
Her taste in men is fucked up.
Have you seen granddad?
l saw him last week.
The old man is going strong.
Always complaining
that we never go to the sugar mill.
Man, l haven't been
to the sugar mill in quite a while.
l was there earlier this year.
l met this girl yesterday. Sofia.
lt was great.
l can see your eyes shining.
And so it goes that her car
was burgled, just across the street.
The CD player was taken.
l'd like to check if you happen to know...
Who might have done it.
No.
You have no idea?
You come to my house
to ask me if l fucked around
with some girl's car.
Your girl's car.
Who got fucked around last night?
The car or her?
Brother, you come to my house.
Don't you fucking brother me, Dinho.
Sit the fuck down.
Listen, you've fucked up here
on the street before, right?
Just for kicks, didn't you?
Listen to me, Dinho.
You are my cousin. l like you.
Sofia is a friend. l like her too.
So do me a favor, go back in,
get that fucking CD player,
bring it here and say you're sorry.
l don't do that kind of thing anymore, idiot.
Just tell me you didn't do it.
- You're so fucking unfair.
- Tell me you didn't do it.
Just tell me, tell me...
l ain't these glue sniffers down the street.
Just tell me... lt's tough to believe...
We're cousins, man, you show up after so
long to accuse me of stealing car stereos.
Cousin, long time no see,
but just tell me you didn't do it.
See ya, l'm leaving.
Cleide, open the door for João.
Seu João...
Cleide asked you
to wait, she's coming down.
- Thanks.
- All right.
Dinho asked me to give you this.
- Hey, Mariá.
- Sidiclei, wake up.
- Hi, Sidiclei, how are you?
- How are you?
- Sleepy?
- l am.
You know what my grandpa
used to do when l was too sleepy?
Feel better now? lt smarts, doesn't it?
João, he came tired from work,
and l let him rest for a bit.
l came back for this bill. l am late.
Have you seen it?
l took it to your bedroom.
You come here.
João, are you having lunch here?
l don't have time,
but leave some soup for dinner.
l'll leave it on the stove.
Okay, thanks.
l'm leaving.
- So, you found a job?
- Yeah.
- Where?
- Cashier, supermarket, night shift, quiet...
- What shift?
- From 1 0:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
- 6:00 a.m.? That's tough.
- Yes, it is.
ln the after-hours... When l was abroad,
l worked in a bar till 7:00 or 8:00 a.m.
l was useless during the day.
There you are. See, Mariá?
The kid works hard.
You complain he doesn't go to church.
He works hard.
Coming!
- Hi, Romualdo, just put it up there.
- Excuse me.
- You want me to set it up?
- lt's fine, there's still some left.
- So, did you bring the stuff?
- Yeah.
l'm running out, l'll need
more later in the week.
Just call and order water.
Of course. l'll get the money, please wait.
R$70 for the pot, R$4 for the water.
- The canister.
- Right there.
Thanks, cheers.
Ana Loecia!
SECURlTY
Good afternoon.
We came to see Seu Francisco.
Come in.
Please wait here. l'll tell him you arrived.
He's on his way.
- Good afternoon.
- How are you, sir?
Barging into my street
without even saying hello...
That's why l am here.
l'm all ears.
l'm here to ask for your blessing
on the job we'll be starting soon.
l don't take leaflets.
l should tell you something, though,
to make myself clear.
l own over half of all
the property in this area.
When l heard about you, sir,
l said, "We have to go and see him."
Who told you about me?
Oh, Seu Anco, Dr. Fernanda,
just about everyone.
Listen now, l don't really...
Call the shots around here anymore.
My business now is back in my land,
where the sugar mill is, in Bonito.
l just live here.
- But l'll tell you something else.
- All right.
l have a grandson,
who lives down the street.
Dinho.
He's been giving some heartache
to his father, who happens to be my son.
l don't want to hear about you
having any business with Dinho.
Dinho is out of yourjurisdiction.
Understood?
You can rest assured, message understood.
And this one, does he speak?
He does. Say something, man.
l can talk, sir.
What's with the blind eye?
ls that fit for a watchman?
l probably see a lot better than you, sir.
Lampião also had only one eye.
Probably saw better than l can
and was shot down all the same.
But before that, he took so many with him.
l like him.
- What is your name, boy?
- Fernando.
- Fernando what?
- Gomes do Nascimento.
- And you, sir?
- Clodoaldo Pereira dos Santos.
Where are you from?
l'm from Limoeiro,
Fernando is from around here.
- From where?
- Guabiraba.
Guabiraba?
Off you go, dismissed.
Hope you do a good job.
Luciene, open the door for the men.
Open the door for the boys.
Why did you talk like that to the old man?
What a fuckup...
lf he didn't come on board,
the job was dead.
Are you stupid, or what?
Bless you, Grandpa.
l'm fine.
Finishing off some business with clients.
Yes, l closed the deal.
They're renting.
Windsor Castle.
Yes, l know about them.
They came to talk to me and Anco.
Did they have a word with you?
They went for some grandpa
hand-kissing, huh?
The guy seems to know what he's doing.
l think.
They start tonight.
Grandpa, l'm worried about Dinho.
He's at it again.
Grandpa, did you hear what l just said?
l know. l know.
l really want to go back there.
One of these days. Okay?
Part 2
Night Guards
l saw their leader,
boy does he talk like an ex-cop.
Sugar?
lt's ridiculous, but, who knows,
it might be a good thing.
lt can't get any worse, can it?
We might reclaim our right to actually
own a CD player in the car.
At least that.
Two cars broken into last night.
Yeah, l heard.
Don't you find it suspicious
that on the day they begin...
A marketing kind of thing...
They make you sicker
to give you the new drug.
That would be ingenious.
Very suspicious.
You pay for school and you pay for
English lessons after school,
but school already teaches us English.
Just listen to the girl's thought.
l'm sorry?
lt's "thank you" in Mandarin.
Only a big head like Fernanda
would say a thing like that.
You're the big head trying
to raise your lQ with those glasses.
Ouch.
Now that you mentioned glasses,
let's see an optician for you, all right?
l don't need glasses.
Want some more, Fernanda?
Come over here, you two.
Let me show you something.
The video of that watchman
hit last month in...
Casa Amarela.
- Surveillance camera?
- Yeah, building across the street.
See?
They drive by and he doesn't even...
They probably did that
to check out the situation.
Thought he had a gun, who knows.
They come back now.
Shot right in the head.
lt's fucked up.
This ain't São Paulo or Belo Horizonte.
This is right here, man.
Our turf.
Play it again.
Watch it.
For slow motion, press here.
So, we've reached
a unanimous decision
on the street security men.
So let's move on to the
next issue which is Seu Agenor.
Seu Agenor has worked for us
for quite some time.
He wouldn't be here for so long
if he wasn't doing a good job,
but lately he's been
showing signs of fatigue.
He's a man of a certain age,
and some have complained
he's been sleeping on his watch.
So l think we should discuss this matter.
What shall we do? Do we let him go?
What shall we do?
l agree, l think he's asking for it.
l don't think it's fatigue,
he's doing it on purpose
to get fired.
And l have been getting my Veja
magazine without the plastic seal.
l won't even go into his lack of manners
at the reception desk.
He never says hello,
with that mean-looking face.
l think he's doing it on purpose.
l don't think he treats everyone that way.
Yes, l agree.
l agree.
Why don't we change his shift hours?
The day shift guys don't want to change.
Not to mention the extra pay for the
night shift which makes him happy.
He's getting paid to sleep, not bad, is it?
- lsn't he nearing retirement?
- ln two or three years.
Can we just let him go?
Have you talked to him?
We have records of formal complaints
filed by the building administrator,
and we also have...
l brought my son Diego today for a reason.
- Diego, say hello to everyone.
- Good evening.
Diego brought some footage
he recorded on a DVD.
Let me show you.
Diego shot these images l want
you to see with a camera phone.
And also with a video camera.
And with a video camera, anyway...
Where is it? ls it on?
Are you sure you have it, son?
Here it is.
- You'll see our dear Agenor.
- There's even a title sequence.
Can you lower the screen?
- Shocking images of negligence.
- He's so rude.
- He has a very relaxed approach.
- He doesn't even hide it.
- The stain on the couch.
- That explains the stain.
- Why don't you clean it?
- Because it's not my job, it's his job.
Right, let's keep focused.
l'd like to say something.
With all due respect to Diego
and Carlos and his video,
Seu Agenor is probably,
l know this for a fact,
the worst doorman in
Recife's metropolitan area.
He can't really work anymore.
But firing him for negligence after
all the work he's done for us,
and the good work done, it's just mean.
We should fire him with his rights,
severance pay...
João, it's mean only if you
look from a certain angle.
l see a lot of this in the
company where l work.
The employee's tired, gets lazy,
sloppy, sets up a scheme
to be fired, to get
his big severance package.
l don't think we should play
that game, we live in a building.
This is no charity organization.
Objectively speaking...
Let's focus, l'm tired, want to go up,
take a shower, eat and sleep.
Let's look at figures,
if we were to let him go.
Taxes, severance pay, social security
amounts to R$14,456.
Way too much.
That's thirteen years of service.
And that works out to...
- To...
- For each tenant...
For each tenant, R$31 6.55.
Extra charge.
lf you can't afford a car, take the bus.
We must understand
we live in a community,
and there are costs.
People here complain about costs but
can afford getting smashed in parties,
and buying burning
incense from Amsterdam.
The worst part is the
comic nature of this meeting.
We have tourist tenants, part-time tenants...
The highly opinionated ones
who remain largely absent,
which is his case.
- And we discuss endlessly.
- There's no need to use that tone.
l'm sorry for my brief absence,
and l'll have to leave right now.
l had a previous appointment.
l'd just like to say that l think it's
so fucking wrong to fire Seu Agenor
by using these video images.
l've already said why,
his work in the building...
Sorry about the language, aunt.
l'd just like to know who
votes against firing him without...
He couldn't give a fuck for...
The ballot is not even open yet.
- l'm sorry, gotta go, good night.
- What do you mean?
Of course, his vote won't count, the ballot
was closed, it's just a point of view.
- Sofia. Hi.
- Hello.
You just saved me from a
weird condo meeting.
And l felt like seeing you. So l came.
Good.
Want to go upstairs?
l've got something for you.
You won't believe it.
A surprise.
You found my CD player?
João, this is not mine.
Where did you get this?
- lt's not yours?
- No.
My cousin Dinho is our resident car burglar.
l went to talk to him to find out
if he knew anything.
Your cousin steals from cars?
l wasted the whole day
with this, missed work.
What a fucking thief.
What's wrong with him?
lt's fucked up.
Dinho is kind of lost, you won't
understand, but he's actually a good kid.
But he fucks up a lot and the family just...
Do you think it works?
We can try.
lt's better than mine.
Some family...
Big family...
lt's madness.
Two orphans, you and me.
We had this orphan vibe
last night, didn't we?
We did.
Cancer orphans.
l talked to my uncle about your uncle.
- He remembers him?
- He does.
You can visit the house you lived in,
if you want.
Wow, l do. lt's been 20 years.
l could draw you the whole house.
The house belongs to my family.
Developers want to buy it, to tear it down.
- Another tower block.
- Another tower block.
Do you like yourjob?
l hate it.
This whole area used to
belong to my grandfather.
- That means you're rich.
- l am.
Want to marry me?
Clodoaldo, isn't that Seu Francisco?
Just leave him.
DANGER
SHARK ZONE
Clodoaldo, the old man's back.
- Dinho, it's for you.
- Who is it?
Tell this idiot not to call at this hour.
Fuck, Mirela. What if l was naked in here?
Big fucking deal,
l've seen you jerking off already.
You little fucking thief.
The street now has security, you bastard.
Try to burgle a car now,
l'll kill you, scumbag.
Clodoaldo, where did you meet this guy?
- That little kid?
- Yeah.
Ask him.
Hey, Ronaldo.
Come over here.
Ask him.
How did you meet?
Playing football in Gravatá.
- What position did you play, Clodoaldo?
- Defense.
Defense?
- Never let anyone through.
- l have to see that.
The ball might have gone through,
but the poor guy's ankle didn't.
- Why don't you tell him?
- Tell him what?
Why don't you tell him how we really met?
Change the tape, man.
Let's talk about something else.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
What are you afraid of, man?
- l'm not afraid.
- Say it, then.
Go on, Ronaldo.
Man... This guy, here,
saw my sister die.
When l got there, he helped me.
lt was bad.
How did she die?
Ran over.
On the interstate, in Gravatá.
She was run over so many times,
she vanished from the asphalt.
A large stain was all that was left.
Was it a truck?
Trucks, cars, motorcycles, vans...
lt was a holiday, the road was fucking busy.
l have this old picture of her.
- You have that picture?
- Yeah, have you seen it?
Yeah.
Fernando, l got curious...
That eye of yours, how did you lose it?
Oh, that was some mean business.
Tell your story.
l hit a shelf at home.
Nine surgeries.
Each meaner than the next.
Transplant, implant...
l did everything they could.
lt was no use.
l ended up losing my eye.
That's too bad.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Did you see anybody
using that phone there?
Man, some guy made
a call, what, five, ten minutes...
Listen up.
Did you guys call me?
No sir, no one here
knows you, who are you?
You don't know me, but you should.
Look, this street right here,
belongs to my family.
Yeah, big people, with money.
This is no favela, man.
And this is no favela pay phone either,
for poor people.
This pay phone is not located in a favela,
and it's not the "take-leave message" type.
You shouldn't talk to us like that, Doctor.
l'm no doctor, man,
nor patient.
lf l find out that you called me,
you're all fucked.
Good night.

Bodyguards
Boiling hot.
So, when are you two getting married?
Grandpa...
Come on, take it easy.
Take it easy? l'm thrilled with the idea,
and l hope he is, too.
How about you, Sofia?
What?
- Marriage.
- l don't know.
Grandpa...
Grandpa... Grandpa wants...
Marriage.
Huh, Sofia? Come on...
Say yes.
- Would you marry me?
- Marry you?
- No, him. l'm only the registry officer.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Would you marry him?
- Careful with him.
l don't know yet. l don't know.
What are you waiting for?
Life.

Good morning.

l think it was one of
these towers around here.

l really don't know the area.
l've been looking for this place
for 20 minutes.
You don't know the street
where the building is located?

Somebody's birthday party...
Somebody's birthday party...
lt's a building with a pool...
Beer... l don't know, l left...

You're lost.

Arthur, Luiz, copy?
Luiz here, copy.
Show yourselves on the corners, please.
Ronaldo, anything wrong?
Everything's okay.
My friend, can you please get up?
Guys, can you see this man?
ls he giving you trouble?
No, everything's fine. Copy?
All right.
Where are you from?
Why? l'm from Argentina.
We have a lost "hermano" here.
Any idea of where
he might have walked out of?
l saw him walk out of the
Camille Claudel building, on Paraiso Street.
Camille Claudel building, copy?
Luiz, thanks. Can you take him there?
Send him over, l'll take him.
And God bless you.
Coffee's good, Maria,
just like your mother's.
Who did your hair? Your mother?
One half for you, the other half for me.
Maria, can l ask you something?
Put your flip-flops on.
l already told you,
you'll end up electrocuted.
lt's dangerous. She might get electrocuted.
lt's serious.
- How old are you?
- Ten.
Ten?
You're wearing my flip-flops, honey.
Give 'em to me.
lt's dangerous.
lsn't it?
l forgot to tell you, we'll be away
next week, so no need to come.
All right.
How many other gigs do you do, Maria?
Right now with you and
at Seu Arnaldo's, in Espinheiro.
l'll ask around at the office
if anybody needs cleaning.
Listen up,
my brother's coming over from Paraná,
and l'll have to run some errands with him.
Understood. Leave the cell phone on.
Do l ever turn it off?
Here comes Seu Rufino, the cuckold.
Good morning.
Amazing, loverboy comes in at 1 0:00
sharp to take care of the old bag.
Loverboy's punctual.
Just look at that, the bastard's
already open for business.
Now watch the chicken shit... Romualdo!
Romualdo!
A bit early, ain't it?
l forgot the meaning.
There are no variables in Chinese verbs.
That applies to all.
Say it.
Good.
Fernanda...
Will you please leave,
you disturb child's attention.
What is it?
- Seu Clodoaldo.
- Thank you, Dona Bia.
ls the receipt in your name
or Seu Ricardo's?
l won't need it.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Okay, if you need it, shout.
Seu Francisco,
l have some time now. l'll take your clothes
to the dry cleaners, okay?
Be sure to come back.
Just like that?
Seu Valdomiro, from house 52,
is out of town.
He left me the keys to water the plants.
Want to come over?
l don't like going into people's houses.
Let's go.
Don't touch anything, all right?
l want water.
- What?
- l want water.
Drink from the jar.
The fucking white house.
What are you looking for?
l want to see the master bedroom.
- Shit, Lu.
- Let's check it out.
l don't want to touch anything.
l want to do it on a big bed.
Let's go.
- Do you have your period?
- No.
Ronaldo!
- What is it?
- Weird thing, there's a kid up there.
Come on down, kid.
Come on down, man.
We are not kidding down here. Come on.
Come on, boy.
All right, down.
Hold him.
- Hold him.
- Dropped like a fruit.
Easy. Don't move.
Running away will make it worse, you hear?
Running away will be worse, stay still.
Stay still, running away won't help.
What should l do with this piece of work?
Give him a nightcap.
Did you have to punch him?
Yeah, but he won't be coming back here.
Lu, how sad. Love you.
There's somebody with
a broken heart in the building.
What do you mean?
Someone wrote a love
message on the street.
- What does it say?
- "Lu, how sad."
Poor thing.
The house you lived in
is about to be demolished.
How tall is the building going to be?
21 floors.
Would they give former
residents a discount?
The telephone used to be here.
- Where?
- Here.
Who was renting the house?
A law firm.
This was my bedroom.
My bed was there.
There were stars on the ceiling.
They are still there.
They never scraped them off,
they painted right over.
Lift me up.
The number you called is unavailable,
please leave a message after the tone.
Clodoaldo security.
Leave your message and l'll call you back.
Seu Clodoaldo, this is Francisco Oliveira.
Please call me at this number.
- What's wrong, Francisca?
- Dona Bia, do you smell something?
l do, what have you done?
l plugged this in.
Fuck, l can't believe you fried this thing.
You plugged it in? You were
supposed to use the voltage adaptor.
Can't you see l wrote "Use 1 1 0 volts"?
- Recife's 220 volts.
- l'm so sorry, Dona Bia.
- l didn't see it...
- For fuck's sake, unbelievable...
l am sorry, Dona Bia.
You can take it out of my pay.
You fried the dog buster. This is an import!
l won't take it out of your pay!
You don't have to talk like that, Dona Bia.
You know what you have to do,
go finish your work.
- Go finish your work.
- You don't have to talk like that.
Unbelievable, go finish your work.
- l will, but don't shout.
- Please, get out of my sight.
- Don't yell at me.
- Go do yourjob, Francisca.
Do it harder, Nelsinho.
You've been here two hours already,
l need you to water the plants.
All right?

lt was great.
But she has some other story,
somewhere else.
She's gone.
What about you?
Finishing university.

You!
Yeah, l've been thinking and moving on.

Uncle is really happy.
He loves playing the host.

Sometimes.

Happy birthday
- Machado, l'm leaving.
- Already? Good night.
Seu Clodoaldo.
l need to have a word with you.
l tried to call you several times.
l left messages. What's going on?
l know, Seu Francisco.
l also need to talk to you.
This is my brother Claudio.
He arrived this week from Paraná.
How do you do, sir?
l want you to come over in 30 minutes.
There's something l
need to discuss with you.
30 minutes. All right.
"What are you? l mean, who are you?
"Good morning, Ms. Avas,
my name is Chiara.
"l'm just in from London
to work in the theater.
"The bulletin board says
you need a personal assistant.
"Well, with exams, the prom
and graduation,
"l do need someone who'll
keep track of my schedule.
"Oh, and most importantly,
"someone to help me run my
lines for the spring musical.
- "lt's a stage term.
- 'Rehearse dialog,' l get it.
"l'll set aside your physics and math books,
"since they are early morning classes.
"How come you know my schedule?"
- Appetizers?
- No, thank you!
"l took the liberty to check..."
Just go!
"l took the liberty to check on
your non-fat soy ice cream..."
- l only asked you to come.
- My brother, Seu Francisco.
He'll now be working with us on the street.
Come on in.
Can't stand these birthday
celebrations anymore.
Children crying, that music...
Let's talk this over
in the living room, so much better.
Let's talk this over, l'll be brief.
Yesterday, l learned
of the killing
over in Bonito, where my land is,
of a man who worked for me for many years.
Reginaldo.
This man would give his
own life to protect mine.
He retired,
became a born-again Christian
some ten years ago,
and now, this.
And for me, this is an act of vengeance.
What l'd like to propose to you, sir, is this.
You would do some
prevention work on my personal security.
l know this will most likely
amount to nothing,
but better safe than sorry.
l see.
ln your mind, this man's death,
Reginaldo, right?
Does it have anything to do with you, sir?
Look,
l just need to know what
is it that you can do
to help maintain my personal security.
Keep an eye on the building,
on people coming in, that's all.
l see, you want me to do
what Reginaldo did for you.
Reginaldo was my foreman.
My administrator.
l'm only asking you to be
my security person. That's all.
l understand, what l don't
understand is his death.
ls it related to you, or is it unrelated?
Are you here to interrogate me?
lt's really none of your business.
l'm just trying to understand.
You see how things turn out?
Seu Francisco, my brother and l...
We saw Reginaldo on Thursday.
Seu Francisco,
April 27th, 1 984.
You don't remember.
But my brother and l, here,
we remember.
l was only six back then.
And l remember.
You are Antonio's boys.
Yes, we are.
Antônio José do Nascimento.
And our uncle,
Everaldo José do Nascimento.
Over a fence.
