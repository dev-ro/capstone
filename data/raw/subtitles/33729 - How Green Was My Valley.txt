/SubEdit b.3875 (http://alfa.icis.pcz.czest.pl/~subedit)/
/I am packing my belongings in the shawl/
/my mother used to wear to the market,/
/and I am going from my valley./
/And this time I shall never return./
/I am leaving behind me/
/my 50 years of memory./
/Memory./
/Strange that the mind will forget so much/
/of what only this moment is passed,/
/and yet hold clear and bright/
/the memory of what happened years ago,/
/of men and women long since dead./
/Yet who shall say/
/what is real and what is not?/
/Can I believe my friends all gone,/
/when their voices are still a glory in my ears?/
/No. And I will stand to say no and no again,/
/for they remain a living truth within my mind./
/There is no fence nor hedge/
/around time that is gone./
/You can go back and have what/
/you like of it, if you can remember./
/So I can close my eyes on my valley/
/as it is today and it is gone,/
/and I see it as it was when I was a boy./
/Green it was, and possessed/
/of the plenty of the earth./
/In all Wales, there was none so beautiful./
/Everything I ever learnt as/
/a small boy came from my father,/
/and I never found anything he ever told me/
/to be wrong or worthless./
/The simple lessons he taught me/
/are as sharp and clear in my mind/
/as if I had heard them only yesterday./
/In those days, the black slag,/
/the waste of the coal pits,/
/had only begun to cover the side of our hill,/
/not yet enough to mar the countryside,/
/nor blacken the beauty of our village./
/For the colliery had only begun to poke/
/its skinny black fingers through the green./
/I can hear even now/
/the voice of my sister Angharad./
Huw!
Angharad!
/Coal miners were my father/
/and all my brothers, and proud of their trade./
- Gwilym Morgan, three pounds seven.
- Thank you, sir.
Lanto Morgan, three pounds seven.
Ivor Morgan, three pounds seven.
Davy Morgan, two pounds five.
Owen Morgan, two pounds five.
Young Gwilym Morgan, one pound ten.
/Someone would strike up a song,/
/and the valley would ring/
/with the sound of many voices./
/For singing is in my people/
/as sight is in the eye./
/Then came the scrubbing,/
/out in the back yard./
/It was the duty of my sister Angharad/
/to bring the buckets of hot water and cold,/
/and I performed what little tasks I could/
/as my father and brothers/
/scrubbed the coal dust from their backs./
/Most would come off them,/
/but some would stay for life./
/It is the honourable badge of the coal miner,/
/and I envied it/
/on my father and grown-up brothers./
/Scrub and scrub,/
/Mr Coal would lie there and laugh at you./
/There was always a baron of beef or/
/a shoulder or leg of lamb before my father./
/There was never any talk/
/while we were eating./
/I never met anybody/
/whose talk was better than good food./
/My mother was always on the run,/
/always the last to start her dinner,/
/and the first to finish./
/For if my father was the head of our house,/
/my mother was its heart./
/After the dishes had been washed,/
/the box was brought to the table/
/for the spending money to be handed out./
/No one in our valley had ever seen a bank./
/We kept our savings on the mantelpiece./
/My father used to say/
/that money was made to be spent,/
/just as men spend/
/their strength and brains in earning it,/
/and as willingly./
/But always with a purpose./
Thank you, Dadda.
/Out of the house and across the street,/
/as I had run a hundred times before./
/Softly now, for respect for chapel/
/was the first thing my father taught us./
/Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop,/
/for that toffee which you could/
/chew for hours, it seems to me now./
/And even after it had gone down,/
/you could swallow/
/and still find the taste of it/
/hiding behind your tongue./
/It is with me now, so many years later./
/It makes me think of so much/
/that was good that is gone./
/It was on this afternoon/
/that I first saw Bron - Bronwyn./
/She had come over from the next valley/
/for her first call on my father and mother./
Is this Gwilym Morgan's house?
You must be Huw.
- Is that you, Bronwyn?
- Yes.
There's lovely you are.
/I think I fell in love with Bronwyn then./
/Perhaps it is foolish to think a child could/
/fall in love, but I am the child that was,/
/and nobody knows how I felt, except only me./
- I'm so proud for lvor.
- I'm the one to be proud.
You think well of our lvor?
It seems only a few months
since he was scratching around here
like this one, with his mouth open.
This is Bronwyn, Huw,
who's to be your sister.
We have met already.
Be careful of the basket.
There's shortcake in it.
This is not for you. You will have
your time to come. Run along now.
/Bronwyn and lvor were to be married/
/by the new preacher, Mr Gruffydd,/
/who had come from the university at Cardiff./
/This was my first sight of him./
# Now here's a man won't get drunk,
can't get drunk, shan't get drunk
# Here's a man won't get drunk, Peter O'Pea
# From my heel to my toe,
from my toe to my knee
# I'll walk the line, chalk the line, Peter O'Pea
- Good evening, Mr Morgan.
- Yes, indeed, sir.
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.
Come now, boys. Back to work.
Ivor, find Dai Griffiths and Idris John
and bring them to Mr Evans' office.
- Will we come with you?
- No. This is a matter for the older men.
- Home to your mother.
- But...
Leave it now, Davy.
Well, come.
- Why aren't you washed?
- We were waiting for you.
The cut is only a few shillings.
There will still be plenty for us.
A bit of supper now, is it, girl?
It is because they are not
getting the old price for coal.
- Come and wash now.
- May we speak first, sir?
- Yes.
- They did not give you the real reason.
We've been expecting it since
the ironworks at Dowlais closed down.
What have the ironworks to do with us?
The men from Dowlais will work for any
wage, so all our wages must come down.
And this is only the beginning. Watch now.
They will cut us again and still again, until
they have this as empty as their promises.
- A good worker is worth good wages.
- Not while there are three men for every job.
Why should the owners pay more
if men will work for less?
Because the owners are not savages.
They are men too, like us.
Men, yes, but not like us.
Would they deal with you just now, sir,
when you went to them?
- No.
- Because they have power and we have none.
- How will we get power, then? From the air?
- No. From a union of all the men.
Union, is it? I never thought I'd hear
my own sons talking socialist nonsense.
- It's good sense.
- Unless we stand together...
- I've had enough of this talk.
- But, Father, it does...
Come and wash now.
Your good mother will be waiting.
Do you think I'll let them make you stand
in the rain and not raise my hands to stop it?
Hush, Davy.
- Who gave you permission to speak?
- It is too important for silence.
- They're trying to punish you because...
- It is not more important than good manners.
But what are we going to do about it?
You'll die of cold when it comes to snow.
Let us stand together
and see how they act then.
Right. The men will come out
if we say the word.
All the pits are ready.
You'll not make me a plank for your politics.
I will not be the excuse for any strike.
But if they do that to the spokesman,
what will they try and do to the men?
We will see.
Be silent now. Finish your supper.
- Father...
- Enough now.
- But...
- On with your work.
- It is not enough.
- Wait until you have permission to speak.
I will speak against injustice anywhere,
with permission or without it.
- Not in this house.
- In this house and outside, sir.
- Leave the table.
- I will leave the house.
- Tell your father you're sorry.
- I'm not sorry.
I'm with you. We can find
lodgings in the village.
Gwilym.
All of you, then?
For the last time, sit down,
finish your supper. I will say no more.
We are not questioning your authority, sir.
But if manners prevent our speaking
the truth, we will be without manners.
Get your clothes and go.
- I'm going with them to look after them.
- Hold your tongue. Get on with your dishes.
Yes, my son, I know you are there.
The men have struck.
What does it mean, Mr Gruffydd?
It means that...
something has gone out of this valley
that may never be replaced.
Home to your father and mother, boy.
They'll need you today.
/Twenty-two weeks the men were out/
/as the strike moved into winter./
/It was strange to go out into the street/
/and find the men there in the daytime./
/It had a feeling of fright in it./
/And always the mood of the men grew uglier,/
/as empty bellies and desperation/
/began to conquer reason./
/Any man who was not their friend/
/became their enemy./
/They knew that my father/
/had opposed the strike,/
/and now it was they who opposed him./
Huw, there's a meeting of the men
in the hills tonight, is it?
- Yes, Momma.
- You will take me.
No, Momma. It is no place for women.
There is a place for this woman
there tonight... upon my soul.
Wait. Wait till you hear me.
I am Beth Morgan, as you damn well know.
I have come to tell you what I think of you,
because you are talking against my husband.
You're a lot of cowards to go against him.
He would do nothing against you
and he never has, and you know him well.
How you smug-faced hypocrites can sit
in the same chapel with him, I cannot tell.
To say he is with the owners is not
only nonsense, but downright wickedness.
There's one thing more
I've got to say, and it is this.
If harm comes to my Gwilym,
I'll find out the men
and I will kill them with my two hands.
And this I will swear by God Almighty.
Lanto! Help!
Hold on, Momma.
They've heard us. They're coming.
He was awake just now.
He'll do, then. But it's beyond me to say why.
You're breeding horses
in this family, Mr Morgan.
This boy should be in his coffin, for my part.
He's a Morgan then, is it, sir?
He should be fed now, Mrs lvor.
A little soup...
and some warm smiles.
Horse.
- Good day. Wait, wait, wait.
- Huw was awake just now. He spoke to Bron.
- How long then for the little one?
- It's hard to tell.
His legs were frozen to the bone.
A year, two years, quiet like that.
But I can't promise that he'll ever walk again.
Nature must take her course. Gee up.
Mind your tongue. I think he heard you.
Where is the light
I thought to see in your eye?
Are you afraid, boy?
- You heard what the doctor said?
- Yes, sir.
And you believed it?
Yes, sir.
You want to walk again, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Then you must have faith.
And if you have, you will walk again,
no matter what all the doctors say.
But he said nature must take her course.
Nature is the handmaiden of the Lord.
I remember one or two occasions when
she was given orders to change her course.
- You know your scriptures, boy.
- Yes, sir.
Then you know that what's been
done before can be done again, for you.
Do you believe me, Huw?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
You will see the first daffodil,
out on the mountain.
- Will you?
- Indeed I will, sir.
Then you will.
I could almost wish
that I were lying there in your place
if it meant reading
this book again for the first time.
/Treasure Island./
Mr Gruffydd?
- I couldn't let you go without thanking you.
- It was only my duty, girl.
No. It was more than duty.
Yes. Huw's a fine boy.
And you're a fine family.
You'd better be going in now.
You'll catch your death.
Will you be coming to supper soon?
Yes. Later, when you're finished
with doctors and such.
- I will hurry them away, then.
- Good.
"Squire Trelawney, Dr Livesey,
and the rest of these gentlemen
having asked me to write down the
whole particulars about Treasure Island
from the beginning to the end, keeping
nothing back but the bearings of the island,
and only because there is
still treasure not yet lifted,
I take up my pen in the year of grace 1785,
and go back to the time when
my father kept the 'Admiral Benbow' inn. "
/All the noble books which have/
/lived in my mind ever since,/
/and always I hoped, and kept my faith./
/For the first months/
/my mother was still upstairs,/
/and we could talk to each other with tappings./
Spring?
There you are, girl.
Easy.
There.
Wait.
It's the old snow got into it.
Gwilym.
There is a wife you have, resting in her bed
and letting strangers care for her family.
There is a wife I have, then.
Go along with you, boy.
Will you say something, Mother?
Go on, say something.
What can I say?
You found plenty to say last time you spoke.
It should be easier now, with friends.
Well...
Well... Come and eat, everyone.
More, is it, boys?
Lanto.
I haven't seen you in chapel lately.
- I have been too busy.
- What business, may I ask?
- Mine.
- Only asking a civil question, I was.
And having a civil answer.
I have been busy with the union.
Unions are the work of the Devil.
You will come to no good end.
At least I am not sitting on it,
talking rubbish in chapel.
- Look here...
- Leave it, or I'll say something to be sorry.
This is a matter that requires airing.
Lanto, why do you think
we at the chapel talk rubbish?
My remark was not aimed at you.
Then aim it.
Very well.
Because you make yourselves out
to be shepherds of the flock,
and yet you allow your sheep
to live in filth and poverty.
And if they try and raise
their voices against it,
you calm them by telling them
their suffering is the will of God.
Sheep, indeed. Are we sheep to be herded
and sheared by a handful of owners?
I was taught man was made
in the image of God, not a sheep.
- Lanto.
- I haven't expressed my views
because I haven't had any wish
to interfere in a family disagreement.
You have my permission to speak.
Very well, then. Here is what I think.
First, have your union.
You need it. Alone, you are weak.
Together, you are strong.
But remember that with strength goes
responsibility, to others and yourselves.
For you cannot conquer injustice
with more injustice,
only with justice, and the help of God.
Are you coming outside
your position in life, Mr Gruffydd?
Your business is spiritual.
My business is anything
between man and the spirit of God.
The deacons shall hear that
you have been preaching socialism.
- Mr Parry...
- Loose the old devil.
- Mr Parry...
- Stop now. He is our guest.
- Beth, a pint of home-brew for Mr Parry.
- I'll give him a clout with the frying pan.
Miss Jenkins. A sweet song. The harp, is it?
Come on, men. Get in here.
Now look, a little song...
Angharad.
Mr Gruffydd, will we always be in your debt?
Now you have made us a family again.
Here. Let me.
Your hands. There's a pity.
No matter.
Have you ever been down the collieries?
- Ten years.
- Ten years?
While I was studying.
- A bit of soap now.
- Don't bother, please.
There's a man for you,
spoiling his good handkerchief.
Look now, you are king in the chapel,
but I will be queen in my own kitchen.
You will be queen wherever you walk.
What does that mean?
I should not have said it.
Why?
I have no right to speak to you so.
Mr Gruffydd?
If the right is mine to give,
you have it.
/Then the strike was settled,/
/with the help of Mr Gruffydd and my father./
/Work again, work to wipe out/
/the memory of idleness and hardship./
/The men were happy/
/going up the hill that morning./
- One and nine.
- One and ten.
/But not all of them, for there were/
/too many now for the jobs open,/
/and some learned that never again would/
/there be work for them in their own valley./
It is the same all over South Wales, it is.
Father, in Cardiff the men are standing
in line to have bread from the government.
Not for us, eh, lad?
We will have our share of the box
and go, if you please, sir.
- Where will you go?
- America.
- My share too, Owen.
- And mine.
No. Our own.
- We will take no charity.
- Not charity, man. Sense.
No, only our own.
Say nothing of this to your mother.
Let this day be over first.
Never mind saying nothing.
I heard.
America.
My babies.
Shall we have a chapter, my sons?
What shall we have, sir?
Isaiah 55.
Those two gone. This is only the beginning.
Then all of you will go,
one after the other. All of you.
I will never leave you, Momma.
Huw, boy, if you should ever leave me,
I'll be sorry I ever had babies.
Why did you have them?
Indeed to goodness, boy, why?
To keep my hands in water
and my face to the fire, perhaps.
For Mr lvor Morgan.
From Windsor Castle it is.
"Mr lvor Morgan is commanded
to appear before Her Maj..."
"Mr lvor Morgan is commanded to appear
before Her Majesty at Windsor Castle,
with chosen members of his choir, on 14
May between the hours of three and five. "
To sing before the Queen.
My son, I never thought
to see this beautiful day.
Idris, Owen, all of you.
Fetch everyone from all the valleys round.
Davy, over to the other collieries.
Invite everyone.
Lanto, down to the Three Bells for beer.
Open house tonight for all who will come.
My sons, you shall have
a sendoff worthy of the Morgans.
Our Heavenly Father, I give thanks
from the heart to live this day.
I give thanks for all I have,
and I do give thanks for this new blessing.
For you are our Father,
but we look to our Queen as our mother.
Comfort her in her troubles, O God,
and let her worries be
not more than she shall bear at her age.
And grant that sweetness
and power and spirit
may be given to these voices
that shall sing at her command.
- Amen.
- Amen.
# God save our gracious Queen
# Long live our noble Queen
# God save our Queen
# Send her victorious
# Happy and glorious
Gwilym. Owen.
# Long to reign over us
# God save our Queen
Good morning, Mr Gruffydd.
Angharad is down to the market.
Angharad? I've come for Huw.
For Huw?
- The daffodils are out, Momma.
- Where are your clothes?
Under my pillow.
For these months, ready for today.
Come you, then, and you shall
bring back a posy fit for a queen
for your brave mother.
Indeed I will, sir.
- Almost there, Huw.
- Yes, sir.
- Low bridge there. Watch out.
- It's fun.
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
Easy it is, now.
There.
Cwm Rhondda.
You can walk, Huw, if you try.
Come, lad. You can walk.
Huw. Walk.
There's a good lad. Come on.
See?
There's a good old man.
You've been lucky, Huw.
Lucky to suffer, and lucky to
spend these weary months in bed.
For so God has given you a chance
to make spirit within yourself.
And as your father cleans
his lamp to have good light,
so keep clean your spirit, huh?
How, sir?
By prayer, Huw.
And by prayer I don't mean
shouting and mumbling,
and wallowing like a hog
in religious sentiment.
Prayer is only another name
for good, clean, direct thinking.
When you pray, think.
Think well what you're saying.
Make your thoughts into things that are solid,
and in that way
your prayer will have strength.
And that strength will become
a part of you, body, mind and spirit.
And the first duty of these new legs
is to get you to chapel on Sunday.
- Indeed they will, sir.
- There's a good old man again.
Give me your hand.
Come on, now.
Will you please remain in your places?
There's to be a meeting of the deacons.
Meillyn Lewis.
Step forward.
Your sins have found you out.
