Here...
still...
alone.
It is all...
so slow...
so heavy...
so sad...
Soon...
I...
will be...
old...
and...
it will...
at last...
be over...
I came to say I'm leaving you
Your tears won't change my mind
You remember happy days gone by
Hello Henri.
Don't say that.
You told me to clear out
so I did.
I have Pimpernel with me.
We're driving to the mountains.
Don't say that.
Don't!
Hello Henri.
It's Maité.
You told me to clear out
so I did.
I took Pimpernel and the car.
We're going to the mountains.
One more thing:
I've got all your poems
and crappy paintings.
You know where
I'm going to dump them all?
In the water Henri.
In the river.
Don't hang up.
Listen to this.
Look Pimpernel!
All the lights went out.
What's the date?
May 24 1983.
It's 10:20.
Thomas!
Hi.
Terrible heat.
I like it here.
The river the highway...
Right.
She's a great girl.
Yes.
Of course
you know how it happened.
You know the story.
She's deaf in one ear...
the left one.
She was sleeping
on her good ear.
I said to her "You're a love."
Startled she turned to me...
and asked me how I knew.
I played along...
That's how I found out.
I would have anyway.
Florence is a lousy liar.
She thought I'd said...
"You've got a lover."
I figured it out fast.
I was relieved that I knew him.
Even if he was my best
and only friend.
And now she's gone.
Shit I never thought
it'd get to that.
It's not like me at all.
That's crazy.
Florence's favorite colors.
She took everything the bitch.
Where are you going?
Out.
Why won't you talk to me?
Mireille...
Sorry but I can't talk
about it here and now.
So go talk about it elsewhere.
I forgot my keys. Leave them
in the box if you go out.
I'm not going out.
You don't love me anymore.
What did you say?
You heard me Bernard.
Yes.
But don't say that Mireille.
Why do you say that?
I know it's not easy.
I'm indifferent to you but
that's not indifferent to me.
I love loving you
but my head's a mess.
It took us a while
to love each other equally.
I watched your love catch up
with mine. And when it did...
a tune started going round
in my head.
You know I love it when we kiss.
But then the tune went...
"What's she doing here?
Who's that monster?
"How dare she touch me
with her mouth?
"She must think I like it!
"Her breath stinks."
I know you smell good...
but I've convinced myself
that you stink.
When I look at you
it's not your beauty I see...
but the space you take up:
standing sitting lying down.
As I watch you the tune goes...
"I don't want
this girl anymore."
I don't want anyone else
to have you...
yet I don't want to be loved.
The few times we talk now
I don't take you seriously.
I talk and listen
but I'm watching you.
I see your shell and insult you
silently to hurt myself.
Then I feel pity for you...
and myself.
So I hate us.
Lonelier together than apart
who could ever love us?
We're gluey together.
I want it to be like before...
To stop all the spying...
to stop all the sabotage...
Bye angel.
I won't be home late.
My name is Bouriana.
The problem with loners
is that they're never alone.
What'll it be?
A small lemonade.
No small drinks after 10 p.m.
How about a large?
Well?
A glass of milk.
Bouriana...Yes I'll hold on.
Give me a beer.
How much?
That'll be seven francs.
I'm holding on.
Excuse me.
Can I buy you a coffee?
Thank you.
That's right. I'm Bouriana.
This gentleman's paying
for my coffee.
Bouriana.
"B" as in Bouriana...
"O" as in Ouriana
"U" as in Uriana...
"R" as in Riana
"l" as in lana...
"A" as in Ana "N" as in Na...
and "A" as in Alfred.
Alfred Bouriana!
We're having a real heat wave...
Your emotional blackmail...
it's like making love
in the shit house...
You can't fool me!
It's too late for your love!
I won't fall for that!

The air is so still.
Let's put on a fresh shirt!
Now you're mad!
How can you want to make love...
when the world's such a mess?!
Are you blind?
You act so cute...
but you're just an animal!
You feed on rotten meat...
laced with tenderness.
You like it?
Not me.
Can't you smell it?
You must have a cold!
Or else you'd puke!
You ask me
what's come between us?
Life that's what!
Isn't that enough for you?
I'm gonna hit!
Watch out! Here it comes!
You gotta hit! Hit!
I'm gonna hit!
I'm hitting!
You can't leave Anna.
We live together.
One two three and four.
Alex? It's your father.
Hi. How are you?
Fine.
What time is it?
6:39.
The telephone startled me...
It was a sort of déjà vu...
like a memory of the present...
That's why...l'm in a daze.
-Tomorrow I'm...
-I know. That's why...
-Let's drop it.
-All right.
-You heard about Aunt V.?
-No.
She didn't die.
Why should she?
They're keeping her alive
on a drip-feeder.
A plumber's nightmare!
It's dreadful!
That's not new.
I'm counting on you.
If I get senile - Bang!
Who wants to be
a bedridden vegetable?!
Remember our contract:
You put a bullet in my brain!
Promise!
I'm not kidding Alex!
Swear it!
I already did.
Unless I die first of course.
Cut that out you asshole! Shit!
Bernard dear...
I'm giving a party
at my place Friday...
to celebrate the tenth
anniversary of Stan's death.
Bring Mireille with you.
Faster!
Faster!
Your turn now.
Your turn.
Play with me a little.
Then we'll turn over and begin.
Then what?
What is it?
I'm lost.
Wasn't it good?
Not really. Something's wrong...
What?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
I don't like it so wet.
You salivate too much.
I feel like...
You're like Alex. You like it
dry so it almost hurts.
It doesn't hurt.
I prefer touching
when it's not so wet.
It's nicer with saliva.
For you.
Don't disappoint me yet...
So soon...
I thought you liked it that way.
But I was wrong.
Tell me when you don't like what
I do so I don't waste my time.
What don't I like?
When I take you in my mouth
and salivate.
I meant when I do it to you.
But I like it when it's wet.
I assumed you'd like
what I like. I was wrong.
No...
Like putting a finger in...
I didn't like that
with Alex at first...
Now I do. But you clench up
before I can get it in.
So we get nowhere.
You know why.
I know. You only let me put
my finger in when I suck you.
But I come too fast that way.
Then you complain.
No. When I want
to give you pleasure...
I don't mind that.
So you say.
I love to hear you moan...
even softly.
And if you weren't so passive...
like Alex...
I'd do it more often.
Be right back.
Cheater!
Me I'm a sneaky opportunist
the child of sacrifices...
Me and my shitty asshole my
blisters my insatiable shoes...
They judge us by our shoes.
His feet were often sore...
he'd put ice cubes in his shoes.
I tried it once.
It helped at first
but then it hurt even more.
My feet were growing...
So was my soul...I was becoming
sublime in every way!
I'm Bernard's friend.
He just left.
The poor boy had a stomachache.
Mireille is still here. Come in.
You know Mireille
his girlfriend?
Do you work nights
at the post office with Bernard?
No. I'm an...oceanographer.
We've got some very special
people here tonight.
That little boy...
has the highest IQ for his age
in all of Europe.
That little man there
is the human time-signal.
It's his voice you hear
when you dial 463.84.00.
But it's been downhill
for him ever since.
That's Henri Bestouches
artist and poet.
He's very ill. He has a bullet
lodged in his brain.
There's Mireille over there
with Elizabeth.
The lady in the white sweater
Josette Lemercier...
was Miss Universe
in the late '50s.
The handsome guy
near the window...
is Jerry Bridgeman.
A U.S. astronaut
who walked on the moon.
Who are you?
I'll be off Alex.
First came words.
No emotions...
Sorry. I don't understand.
He says
"Young people are too silent."
"You've forgotten how to talk."
"Maybe you think
people aren't worth talking to."
That's not it.
"You're wrong.
Maybe you're afraid."
He wants to know
if you like movies.
"I was a grip when movies
were as silent as I am."
"I pushed the first dollies."
"I remember that matinee idol
Jonas."
"He made the whole crew laugh.
"Whenever they shot
a love scene...
"the director
told the actors..."
"to say tender words
to each other before kissing.
"Anything so one could see
their lips moving.
"So in the middle
of a love scene Jonas...
"would make daring comments
on his partner's breasts...
"or proposition her
during a take."
"Jonas
who was a gentle person...
"and shy with women
in real life...
"became a lion
in front of the camera."
He says...
"When the films were shown..."
"during the love scenes...
"one or two people
in the theater would laugh.
"They were deaf people...
"who could lip-read
Jonas' obscenities.
"Silent films were better
because...because..."
Slow down Sylvain.
Excuse me.
Miss I watched you all night.
I composed this for you.
I'll play it for you.
We're too old to change
our habits.
Shit!
They say that broken glass...
We should pick it up.
What did he say?
He said "C'est la vie."
That's what life's about.
I was nine when you walked
your first steps.
For years
I lived only for outer space.
But don't you think
it's hopelessly screwed up now?
How old are you Jenny?
18. And you?
I turned 53...recently.
I'll be 28 on August 22nd.
You know what distresses me?
That I've accomplished
so little in my life.
It's my 37th birthday today.
37 goddamn years!
Makes you stop and think.
When Mozart was my age
he had been dead for two years!
How depressing!
But there's a way out:
blowing my brains out!
-May I make a call?
-Come with me.
Axel.
Thomas? It's me.
Recovered from your swim?
Is that Florence I hear?
There's a letter for both of you
under the door.
The records in the bag
are for Florence.
That's all. Ciao.
Good night Nicolas.
Good night Pimpernel.
You know our names Mr. Bear?
Of course.
Will you come play
with us tomorrow Mr. Bear?
Only if you go to bed right now!
Good night
Nicolas and Pimpernel.
Good night
to all our little friends.
Time for beddy-bye.
Kiss your parents good night...
and we'll be back
tomorrow night.
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
You're just like Bernard
at a party:
always in the kitchen alone.
I'll get you a glass.
All the glasses
are in the living room.
This cup is all that's left.
My private cup.
I'm the only one
who's ever drunk from it.
Even my brother Stan
would never have used it.
He bought it for me in ltaly.
Stan traveled everywhere.
Whenever we were apart
even as children...
we would meet through
telepathy at night.
At exactly 10 p.m...
I'd think very hard of Stan...
and he'd think very hard of me.
Three years ago I forgot
my telepathic date with him.
He was in Germany
on a business trip.
I never saw him again.
He died on a German freeway...
In his car...
Totally dead!
Be very careful with my cup...
Alexander.
Mireille?
Your hair...
Next time you do something
like that...
please don't do it in my home.
You did it behind
Bernard's back.
He'll be furious.
Bernard won't mind
I assure you.
Don't worry.
You too!
Isn't it nice
to drink through the chink?
I'm going to wind up a loser.
Yet I stood a chance.
I wanted to be someone
outstanding:
flyer traveler musician...
Can't I be reborn?
I'm going to wind up a loser.
Yet I stood a chance.
I wanted to be
someone outstanding:
flyer traveler musician...
Can't I be reborn?
It's our first meeting.
Only first times matter to me.
Then you won't last long.
If I had a kid
I'd ignore him once he talked.
For years
I longed to make love.
Then I actually did it.
I mean...
No it's the opposite.
I never tried to fulfill my best
dreams. Only to re-dream them.
Want some tea?
Sure.
There's only one cup.
The label's been cut off.
It could be anything.
I saw you in the bathroom
earlier.
Quite a scene.
So you're the spy.
I've tried it more often
since I came to Paris.
Haven't you ever?
I'm too happy for that.
Too happy?
Yes. I mean too scared.
Where are you from?
Blois. In the Loire Valley.
I came here a year ago to live
with my friend a Parisian.
I wanted to act in commercials
but I got nowhere.
I almost got hired
by a chocolate firm...
but then they saw my tooth...
Next it was a cosmetics firm...
but with my wrinkles...
What wrinkles?
On my forehead.
I see.
Five of them.
I've had them since childhood.
I make films.
Films or video?
For now
what I do is dream up titles...
for the films I plan to make.
If I were you...
I have to go into the army
tomorrow.
If I were you I wouldn't go!
Right. Why go
when we're already veterans?
It's menopause time.
And I'm in a rush.
Yet I'm all for conquerors.
I had a great line worked out
for the army psychiatrists.
I told them
I was unfit for service...
because I couldn't sleep
in a room with other guys.
It didn't work.
They said the army wasn't for
sleeping. So I'm off tomorrow.
Do you fall...
Do you fall in love often?
Yes easily.
I thought so.
But a real lover sticks around.
I feel closer
to people once I've left.
Love is as old as the hills...
Lovers are worn out.
Desire isn't easy to come by...
and it doesn't come cheap
nowadays.
There's plenty of passion
but it gets wasted on details.
And it doesn't travel.
Me neither.
Mireille...
I'm going now.
OK.
Who are you in love with
these days?
I'm on to a new heartbreak.
I don't want to lose it.
My heart's proud of its pain.
Her name is Florence.
I met her two years ago but I
toyed with her before that.
Now she's left me
for my best friend Thomas.
Same old story.
I've never cheated on anyone.
Never got the chance.
She's gone.
She left me a note
in our toothglass:
"I'm leaving to forget you."
In her deadly prose.
We lived in my room.
We slept in my single bed.
And lived on her unemployment.
Yet she still loved me
on Sunday...
Even Monday...and Tuesday...
She told me all about her youth.
She had lots of love affairs.
One when she was very young
with a boy who died.
His death nearly destroyed her.
I never got along with her...
Last summer
we were on an Aeolian island.
I gave her my first slap.
I could've held back
but I decided not to.
I don't try to change.
She didn't get it...
that I kept tabs on my
cowardice on my weaknesses.
I like to spy on myself
as if I were a foreigner...
a foreign body
as scientists say.
If I changed
I'd distort the experiment.
I can see the kind of movies
you'll make.
It's easy to get self-obsessed
when you're alone.
I've got lots of projects
enough for two lives.
I like to view my life
as a biography.
Born in Paris 1960. Died
in Paris 2040. I won't leave.
Last week I had a dream.
In my dream I was asleep
then I was awake...
and found a book between
the sheet and the blanket...
a book I'd never seen before.
I leafed through it.
It was my autobiography.
But it was unfinished.
I'd died while writing it.
-Want some?
-I don't drink.
Florence was madly
in love with me.
More than I with her.
So now she's down and I'm out!
When she left three days ago
we had a...
She took all her things.
She wanted to take the letters
I wrote her.
I said they were mine.
I wrote them. They're mine.
In the end I gave in.
She doesn't know
I've Xeroxed them.
This scarf
is all I have left of her.
But...it's her all over.
You really think so Mireille?
You know my name?
In the army they should
assign you to espionage.
-Want one?
-I don't smoke.
I'm going out for a walk.
I'll come with you.
I like walking alone.
So do I.
Then we can go together.
In fact I don't go out much.
I'm scared of getting
pushed under the subway...
or being blown up
or finding out I've got cancer.
At 15 I wasn't scared.
Now I'm old enough
to be tortured in a war.
I had a nightmare.
Midnight?
Know this one?
"Here's how many nights
and a day
"Here's how long
you've been away
"It was to be
our last time apart
"The last strain
on my shipwrecked heart
"You said you'd be back
in spring
"A time for sweetness
and whispering
"You said we'd meet
in a budding grove
"And through Paris streets
we'd rove"
"I love you and love you still
I love you alone and always will
"But if you choose
to go your way
"I'll remember our love
as a happy day
"I'll hit the road
a smile on my face
"I'll go bask in the sun
some other place
"Sorrows won't make me
give up my life
"I'm not as patient
as a sailor's wife"
He got home very late.
I was asleep.
For a long time
he sat on the bed in the dark.
The sound of the key
had woken me...
but I pretended to be asleep.
I felt his eyes on me.
It was a drag.
It wasn't the first time.
Then...
he got into bed...
and made love to me trying to be
gentle so as not to wake me.
He likes to do it that way.
Sometimes he says to me...
"Let go. Play dead."
When I met him...
at first right after
my father's death...
he felt at ease with me.
Now he criticizes me for things.
Things I don't understand.
For him it all matters:
my past my future
my present and my death...
I often wonder what my father
would've thought of him...
and of me today.
I am...l'm what I am.
It's very late.
It's today I'm leaving.
Everyone's going.
We're the last.
I'm leaving.
It's like a dream for me
being with you.
Like an unusually deep dream.
Only deep sleep
makes you dream like that.
Sitting beside you this way...
is like eternity.
The moment I saw you...
I knew I was destined
to love you.
I'll say it once and for all:
I love you Mireille
more than anything.
We must fall in love!
Unaware of it wordlessly...
It's too late!
Pretend you didn't hear that...
Time to shut up. I will.
After 20 years of battling
silence.
To think that your body
will age...
Shriveled breasts
and more wrinkles Mireille...
On your belly under your ass.
It's all my fault...
You see Mireille love...
Iove without regrets...
Iove without
nasty afterthoughts...
Say come I'll come
say smile I'll smile...
We'll sleep together
for as long as you want...
I want to work with you
form an unbeatable team...
Whatever our signs
Libra or Leo I'll sign up!
Maybe Florence seeing
our strength will join us...
You and Florence and me...
I'll be the go-between lover...
It should be so moving.
Back and forth I go!
Alone you couldn't jolt me out
of my shell...
Together
we'll change our habits...
We'll leave Paris
maybe even France.
And out of love for me Alex...
you'll stop
destroying yourself...
You'll respect the warmth
of your blood...
your serene presence...
your clear perception
your gentle feelings...
Under your impulse
our melancholy will fade away.
If I could only escape
monologues Mireille.
Mental diarrhea!
Not set my sufferings to music!
Not bury my lover with words!
But if I shut up
she'll kill herself!
Kisses won't seal our lips...
Help me take wing Mireille...
I weigh a ton!
Don't look I'm a truck!
I'll never live again
Mireille. Never!
Sorry I'm going to the can.
Hold it young man.
You can't relieve yourself
until we're moving.
Taken!
Got any change?
I'll have one last game.
It's not two francs.
It's three.
The cost of living goes up.
Life doesn't.
Try again Earthling!
How about this for an answer!
I've had it never again!
They'll never screw me again!
It's over.
He's not even tired.
But he's going home
to his mistress.
He played badly.
He lost everything.
But he'll play tomorrow.
He's going to sleep
in her bed...in her arms.
Good night.
Try again...
Earthling!
Mireille...
It's Alex I missed my train.
Can I speak to Mireille?
I'm not here Bernard.
I'm not here at all.
Mireille it's Alex.
Alex help me...
to get out of this...
Bernard!
Bernard...
I turn my back to you.
