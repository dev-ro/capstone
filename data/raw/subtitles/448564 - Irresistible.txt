You're out, mom!
Oh, my God, I left the iron on. Come on!
Mom, you promised us
some ice cream.
We'll get some at home.
There isn't any at home.
I think there might be.
Craig!
Craig!
Craig!
# If you're lost, you can
look and you will find me #

# If you fall, I will catch
you I will be waiting #
# Time after time #
#After my picture fades and
darkness has turned to gray #
#Watching through windows
you're wondering if I'm okay #
# Secrets stolen #

Elly, Elly.
Sh!
# I will be waiting
time after time #
# Time after time
Time... #
Thank you!
# Time after time #
Sh!

# Time after time.
Time after time #
I can't hear my show
with all this noise!
You're show is finished!
Spotty quoll wants
some orange juice.
Alright. There should be
one open in the fridge.
Where?
There is not.
Well then, look
in the pantry.
Good boy, Spotty quoll.
Adsee...
No, that's not
a real word, is it?
There's too many... Adse... I don't...
I give up.
What is it?
Incandescence!
Glowing with heat?
I know it means glowing with
heat. How did you know that word?
I can't top
in spelling today?
You can top in spelling today because
you're so clever! You're the smartest girI!
Oh, Jesus!
Alright, next word.
Mommy, mommy!
What is it, baby?
What's the matter?
There was someone
in the hallway!
Oh, no. No, there
isn't. What did you hear?
There was someone running and
breathing like a sick cat. I'm scared.
Sweetheart, you know
what it probably was?
Your sister and I
where in the back
and that funny little wind-up
dog went off. Maybe it was that.
No, mommy, there's someone
in your bedroom.
Well, I'll go
and find out, okay?
Wait here for me.
Mommy's gonna check it out.
Take care of Spotty.
Don't let him get scared.
I'll be right back.
Boo!
Come on with me.
Got a game going.
Hello?
Spotty quoll's starving!
Oh! We might eat soon, ey?
Here we go!
What was it, dad, that mom
used to grow? Was it primula?
Petunias.
Where's Craig?
I'm rushing to pick him up.
He lost his keys.
Lost his keys?
That's not good.
That's not good but you're
great. Thank you so much.
Bye, giris. See you in
the morning. Bee good now.
Oh, uhm, you know what?
Maybe I could pick up
some petunia seedlings.
No, they'll just be a niusance,
Soph. Too much watering.
Okay.
It's so beautiful. It's the
shadows that make it so stunning.
Moment between the owl
and the dove.
No, that's back to fronts,
not the shadows.
It is the quality
of the light that counts.
Could you just agree with me
for once on our special day?
Did I say anything?
Did you know?
Here's to the next decade
being as great as the last.
Yeah.
You know what I did today? I
finished my first illustration.
Good for you.
Full patronizing?
No, I mean it. I know this
is a difficult one for you.
So, you'll tell me
what the secret is?
No, then there won't be
a secret.
Everyone's going to see it. You're painting
for a book. It's public consumption.
I'm not ready, yet.
I always talk to you
about my work.
That's because you are so
much more talented than I am.
This is certainly true. This is why my clients
treat me like a toad in a swimming pool.
Oh, someone just walked
over my grave.
Please. I promise I
will be not critical.
So fresh they're jumping
right off the plate.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I love you.
So, let's celebrate
that you finally started.
We might as well. We've
spent the advance already.
What did you forget?
I dashed home
but you'd already turned it off. Thanks.
The iron.
Why did you come home?
I didn't come home today.
You must've turned it off.
Oh! Right.
You couldn't have come home.
You lost your keys.
I guess I did.
I must've turned it off.
Oh, Ginger.
I'm so sorry.
Ginger Tom!
My God, no!
And when do you suggest?
A- ha.
Yep, Tuesday.
Next Tuesday.
Tuesday'll be fine.
Absolutely.
Bye!
The frock, it's gorgeous.
I love the hibiscus flowers.
Thank you.
How are you, darling?
How is it all going?
Great.
Oh, my God.
How embarrassing.
They don't even mention Craig. I talked about
him all the time and his work and everything.
They don't even say a thing?
It's been out
for almost a month.
He's feelings
are gonna be hurt.
Don't show it to him.
Supermom Sophie,
that's... I wish...
It's good publicity.
Now, I got you in here.
Head office has trebled the print
run and wants a major launch.
They want the final copy
by March 28th.
When?
March 28th.
March doesn't work for me.
You'll do
what you always do.
No, the...
Let's stay with April.
Look, darling, I know this
is a very hard time for you,
but all the other artists
have signed off on that date.
Remember
when my mom died?
It took me ages
to get over it.
But it does get better,
eventually.
Let's not catch myself
trying to phone her.
How's your dad?
He's fi...
He's very independent.
So, anyway,
how are you going with it?
I'm worried that you haven't
shown me anything so far.
No, I've decided to, uhm...
I'm working on something that up
until now I've been trying to forget.
Whatever's worth remembering,
you'll do it.
I don't know that we're
meant to remember everything.
Maybe we'd go crazy
if we did.
Oh!
Come to bed, Sophie.
It's late.
It's okay,
I promised I wouldn't look.
I have to work.
Okay.
Ginger Tom,
if you value your life.
I'm so sorry about asking you
to work late.
I promise I won't make
a habit of it.
It's what they all say.
C'mon, Jen,
or we'll be late.
Next time
you're coming, too.
It's perfect.
Enjoy this show.
Come on, then.
Thanks, Mara.
Bye, Craig!
See ya.
Jen asked me
to help you
with the computer.
Oh, thank you.
Yes, good.
I haven't even started
inputting yet.
My assistant got really mucked
up by the last IT personnel I had.
We we'll be fine.
So, how are you settling in?
Very well.
I love it.
You're all so talented.
I find your work inspiring.
Don't look at this then.
Tight deadline?
Yes. My clients, the mighty Quinns',
have changed their minds again.
They've decided they need
a music room by yesterday.
It's a lovely photo.
Oh, thank you.
It's...
That's Sophie, my wife.
This is Elly. She's seven.
And that's Ruby,
who's ten going on twenty-one.
They're just gorgeous, Craig.
So, tell me
about you.
I'm happily married.
One daughter.
And what does he do?
I'm afraid he shares
my passi√≥n for IT.
You can ask him all about that
tomorrow when you meet him.
At the party.
That's it!
Oh, good.
Well done.
Thank you!
Now I'm all yours.
Here, so...
I suggest a subtle lighting.
Of course it won't lit up like a
toilet block but I'm holding my grant.
I get layered lighting and a
much stronger room as a result.
Good.
May I?
You don't need
to do it now.
It's okay.
Yes.
Well, I...
I might leave you to it.
I should get home
and help with the kids.
Sophie's been very tired
lately. She's not sleeping.
Really? That's not what
they said in the article.
What article?
What's wrong?
Oh, it's...
It's really good. Sophie will be
pleased. I think she's seen this.
You promised you'd find
Spotty quoll.
We will, sweetheart.
I promise. C'mon.
Can you turn the volume
down a little, please?
She can't find the quoll. We've
been searching for 40 minutes.
You haven't seen it?
No, I haven't seen
the quoll.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh! And the mighty Quinns'
just phoned.
They say they will consider
my proposals.
So there is a God in heaven
after all.
Good. That's an important
project, isn't it?
You know it is.
Elly, do you think it might be possible
for you to play with one of your other toys?
Isn't she too old to play
with stuffed toys?
No, she's not.
No, I'm not!
I want quolly.
Alright.
I will find the quoll.
Sophie, this morning,
when I look after the kids,
I want you to go out and buy
that dress you've had your eye on.
I don't have time.
I have to work.
I thought you might like to
wear something special tonight.
Do I really have to go?
Come on,
you said you would.
Well, what's wrong
with my clothes, anyway?
Sophie, it's a treat.
It's a double celebration.
I finished my plans
and for you
there's this.
Oh, my gosh.
It's very good.
It's totally wrong but...
Mom's the word.
Gosh, it makes this...
Sounds like
I'm a single mom.
I talked about you all
the time. I'm really sorry.
It's okay. It's about you, not about me.
But mommy, you have to find
Spotty quoll.
Yes, sweetie. Come, here.
Come look at you and Ruby.
Look!
I want my quolly.
Alright, trap it, Elly. Let
the great quoll hump again.
You shouldn't trap
animals, dad.
There you're quite right. You
should bite their heads off!
Sophie.
Go buy the dress.
Do you know what? Everything
turns up in the end.
You just have to stand up
a little.
That looks good!
Sexy!
You think so?
It's your color.
Oh, my God,
I don't have time.
I... I'll take it.
I'll take it.
Great!
You really think
it suits me?
Yes, absolutely.
Wow, what a great house
and so close to the water. How
much do you pay your IT personnel?
Oh, she's married to an IT
entrepreneur, whatever that is.
Whatever that is. It's gonna
be an early night, right?
I have to work
in the morning.
Yeah, of course.
And thank you.
What's that for?
'Cause I love my dress
and the guy that gave it to me. Thanks.
Alright.
Shall we do this thing?
Hi. I'm Helen,
Mara's mother.
Craig and my wife Sophie.
Lovely to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.
Really?
Would you like me
to take your wrap?
Oh, there you are!
I was wondering
where you got to.
What good taste you have,
Sophie. Both you and my daughter.
Well, it makes you think,
doesn't it?
With all the dresses, it's amazing this
sort of thing doesn't happen more often.
It's such a pleasure to meet
you. I've heard heaps about you.
Craig talks about you
all the time.
What does he say?
Everything!
Everything.
You're an illustrator.
You sleep badly at night.
Oh, he tells you everything.
I just wanted to say I think it's
inspiring this book you're doing.
It's such a great topic. What dark
secrets are you planning to reveal?
You'll just have to get the
book and find out, I guess.
I will, I will. I'm just
gonna go and change my dress.
Oh, no.
You don't have to.
No, please, you look so
much better in it anyway.
Right.
# Tell me, tell me lies #
# Oh, no, no,
you can't disguise #
# You can't disguise.
No, you can't disguise #
Another one?
Thanks.
Nice dress.
Thank you. I'm so glad
you both could make it.
I want you to meet Jimmy. Jimmy,
my husband. Jimmy, come here.
This is Jimmy.
This is Sophie.
Hi, Sophie.
Should we dance? Let's
dance. You hold that.
Come on!
# Close your eyes.
Another broken heart #
You're Craig,
aren't you?
Mara's told me
all about you, Craig.
What did she say?
Oh, good things.
You know,
you're under recognized.
Are you?
# Tell me lies.
Tell me, tell me lies #
# Oh, no, no,
you can't disguise #
# You can't disguise.
No, you can't disguise #
# Tell me lies,
tell me sweet little lies #
# If I could turn the page #
# In time then I'd rearrange
just a day or two #
# Close your eyes,
close your eyes #
Oops!
Thank you!
You know, I identify
with that article of yours.
Trying to balance
work and home.
Don't believe
everything you read.
I have one and that's pretty
forlorn. Jessica's eight.
Oh, my gosh,
you look so young!
No.
I just started young.
I managed to get myself
knocked up accidentally.
God, it was hard.
But I wouldn't have given Jessy
up for anything in the worid.
Then a couple of years ago
I met Jimmy.
He's been wonderful.
Did you and Craig meet
in America?
No, here.
Really?
Yeah, I came here
when I was 17.
My dad's from Melbourne
and, uhm, well,
he blamed my wild use
on New York
so, as soon I graduated from high
school, he whisked us away to safety.
How did you find it?
Well, my, uh, mom's a New
Yorker, was a New Yorker,
and, uhm...
Well, so it's a huge,
huge adjustment for her.
She tried to make
the best of it.
Craig told me
about your mother.
I lost my best friend.
It's a gap
that doesn't go away.
I'm sorry.
Kate was an aid worker.
She was working in Kosovo
with abandoned children
trying to reunite them
with their families.
One night someone threw a Molotov
cocktail through the window
and Kate was killed
in the fire
trying to get
the babies out.
Oh, my God,
how awful.
And I miss her so much.
And I keep thinking
if only she hadn't been there.
She shouldn't even have been there.
Someone hurt her very badly
here. That's why she went.
I often stayed with her.
We would take endless photos
of the orphans.
I'm having an exhibition
of them. Will you come?
I'd love to.
Thank you.
Imagine what it must be like
to burn to death.
I am cold. You wanna
go back to the party?
Yeah, sorry.
# I'll make you crazy #
# I'll get inside you
with a look around #
You're dancing!
# I'll make you crazy #
# and I'll do anything
and be happy again #
Had a good time for you, ey?
What?
I heard you're having
a few problems with Craig.
But don't worry. He's one
of the best blokes around.
I'm sure he'll stand by you.
Who told you that?
Come one, Jen, you can't
say something like that
and then you don't tell me
who said that.
Look, Soph,
the twelve-step program
really works
and you get to meet
some terrific people.
What are you talking about?
Alcoholics Anonymous.
I've been there myself.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I don't even drink.
That's what I used to say.
Are you serious?
No wonder everybody's
staring at me.
No one's staring at you. You're
not gonna believe a stupid rumor.
People love rumors.
Don't worry.
We know it's not true.
There are people there who have
kids that are in our kids' classes.
And she was so certain.
You know what?
Ever since you started this
book, you've been spinning out.
Oh, no, no.
Wait a minute, no.
This isn't about my work.
I hate the way you're not sleeping.
You're worried all the time.
Just let's get
in the car.
Oh, great. Marajust
saw this whole fight.
Not everyone
is staring at you.
She is.
Isn't it perfect?
How did you know?
You mentioned that Sophie
collects owls.
It's just a wonderful hobby.
I remembered.
Did I really say that?
That must be brave on.
Choose me!
Choose me!
Choose me!
Are you sure
Sophie's out?
Yeah, the kids
have taken her shopping.
Let's put it down
over here.
Down here.
Oh!
Alright?
It's so great.
Shopie's got
such great taste.
Yeah.
I think it would look better
in there.
Let's have a look.
Yes!
Happy Birthday!
It's magnificent, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Thank you and you.
Thank you, sweetie.
Where did you find it?
And it looks
like a weighs a ton.
How did you ever
get it in here?
I had it delivered.
What will you call him, mom?
I think to begin with it's a
she not a he, don't you, dad?
Absolutely.
Minerva.
Yes.
When I was your age,
my mom used to tell me stories
about Minerva.
She was a goddess, and like a
fairy she flew with the owls.
How about these?
You know, I'll find quolls.
I miss quolly.
I know you do, baby.
I know.
So, what do you think?
Is it good in here?
Yeah, I think it is.
It's great.
Can we have
a little sneak?
No!
No, no.
No, absolutely no. No,
but we can have some cake.
Yeah!
That's a nice car.
I've been thinking.
Mine is past of use
by date.
But then again
so am I.
Dad!
I guess it will see me out.
If you want a new car, you should
have one. I'll help you choose it.
No. It would be
a waste of money.
Debbie!
Debbie?
I like your new car.
I wish.
It's not our car.
How are the giris?
The giris are fine. More
at the point, how are you?
There were,
there were wasps.
Where did they come from?
There's a wasp plague.
The pest guy says they've been finding
nests in all kind of weird places.
Anyway, they got rid of them.
They won't be back.
So... it is your car.
Oh, that.
No, no.
That's not our car.
But I saw you
getting out of it!
You went into your house!
You saw someone
go into my house?
Only you.
Well, she dresses like you.
She was wearing a dress like
that pretty one of yours.
The one that I love. Splashed
all over with hibiscus flowers.
When was this?
You know what
my memory's like.
But sometimes she looked
like she was you.
Wasn't it you?
No.
What have you done
to your face?
I hope it wasn't that nice
husband of yours who did that.
He isn't the type
for any of this.
My key wouldn't...
I changed the locks.
What happened?
Hey!
Daddy!
Alright, that's it.
Go watch TV, giris.
Go ahead.
Now.
I changed all the locks.
I think someone's
been getting in.
My hibiscus dress is missing
and Maggie saw a woman in it
get out of that blue car that's been
on the street. You know which one?
Can you say that again?
Someone stole my hibiscus dress
and Maggie saw a woman in it.
Maybe she's the one
that came into the house
and put the wasps
in the pot on purpose,
because I'm not convinced
that it's natural.
The pest guy didn't think
there was anything unusual.
What about Spotty quoll?
Kids' toys get missing.
You said yourself
that they always turn up.
These are for you.
I think we should call
the Police.
This all started
when you lost your keys.
It was probably you
that Maggie saw in the dress.
Why would someone
break into the house
and steal a toy and a dress
and nothing else?
Anyway, you changed the locks.
That's the main thing.
How are you feeling?
The doctor thought you might
be still a bit delirious
with stings and all that.
Oh, my God. Well, maybe
that's it. I don't know.
Thank you.
Cup of tea?
Yes, thank you.
Hang on!
Hello!
How are you there?
I was just passing by. I wanted
to drop in and see how you are.
It's a fear of mine
to be bitten by wasps
and there was
a whole nest, I heard?
Poor thing!
It must have been shocking.
Can I get you
a cup of tea or something?
Why don't you just
lie down?
No, no, no.
I'll get it.
Why don't you have a seat?
I'm sorry.
We're out of tea.
It's okay.
I'll have coffee.
No, I'll go next door
and ask the neighbor.
Okay.
A couple of seconds.
Maggie.
Maggie!
Ma...
Sorry.
I found some.
There was some tea in the
cupboard. I poured you a cup.
I gotta go. Jen's just
called. The computers crashed.
I wish I could stay.
Can we get together some time?
I'd really like that.
Sure.
Just take,
take care.
Maggie!
Maggie.
Mara came by today.
She came by
to see how I was doing.
Mh.
That's thoughtful.
She was wearing a dress just
like my missing hibiscus dress.
Don't you think
that's strange?
Not really.
Craig, it was identical to the
dress that I have that's missing!
And the one that Maggie said someone was
wearing when they broke into the house.
Mara's never been here before.
She sure seemed to know
her way around.
Well look, maybe once.
What do you mean?
She helped me carry in
the owl pot.
What?
I know I said I...
I knew you were Iying that day.
What was she wearing?
Was it a hibiscus dress
like mine?
Hers was backless.
Why did you lie to me?
I don't know. Maybe because
it was your birthday.
I felt bad about it
afterwards.
Why would you need
to hide Mara?
I don't know why!
I'm telling you now.
Could we just drop this?
What do you want from me?
What?
I feel like your
accusing me of something.
Accusing you of what?
Oh, Sophie,
come here.
What, what? Are you
doing anything with Mara?
No, of course not! And
I wouldn't. And she's...
Come here!
I need to go work.
Oh, Sophie.
You need to sleep.
Craig, there's someone
in the studio.
Someone's in the studio.
It's all fine, Sophie.
You just forgot to lock up.
No, I'm positive.
I locked up.
You're probably
so tired.
You just thought you did.
Somebody's getting
at your keys.
We changed the locks.
What if somebody at the office
is getting at your new keys?
I honestly
don't think so.
What about Mara?
Please, don't go on
about her again tonight.
You know, all this started
when she began working for you.
Look, I'm tired.
You're tired.
Why don't you take a pill?
Get some sleep and I'll take the
giris to school in the morning.
Alright.
Sophie, it's Rina.
Just want to ring
how the book's coming along.
They're planning the mother of all
launches at the Frankfurt book fair.
I just need to know that you're on
target. I hope everything's alright.
Please, call me.
What time is it?
You didn't come
to bed at all, did you?
I found my dress.
Well, there you are.
You see,
everything turns up
in the end.
Have you been smoking?
It smells so bad.
I still think it's really strange.
It's not exactly like that.
Yes, Rina,
I'll make the deadline.
No, the kids have just, you know,
I've been very busy, that's all.
Don't worry
if I don't call you.
It'll be fine.
We'll get there.
Yeah!
Mom!
I gotta go. Ruby's calling me. Bye.
Did you knock?
What's that smell?
You know you're not supposed
to disturb me while I'm working
unless it's an emergency.
Is this an emergency?
I can't find Buddee.
An emergency!
Use your eyes.
I'll show where to look from now
on. When we're having play dates
and I'm working, what's the
rule? You don't disturb me.
It's right here.
You must have taken it
to school, Ruby.
Mom, I'm telling you
I didn't.
I put it here.
I'm telling you.
It has to be here
somewhere.
Sophie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to find Buddee.
Can I help you
put things back?
No, no, everything's
under control. I'm fine.
If you're not in bed soon,
I'm coming to get you.
If you don't sleep,
you go nuts.
I did not put these
in there.
I did not put these
in there.
Mara?
Hey, Mara,
are you there?
Where have you been?
Well, not for much longer.
Gotcha!
What do you think
you're doing?
Sophie.
My wife didn't want
to bring this here
but I've insisted. I cannot
and will not allow anything
that puts my family at risk.
I have a feeling that Sophie
Hartley was watching me
before Mara found her in Jessy's
room. What was she doing there?
Your Honor, it is very, very frightening
to find someone
in your child's room.
It was really odd
at the museum.
I hadn't send the invitations
out so she didn't actually know
where my exhibition
was being held.
And it was so strange that she
ran away. We know each other.
And Jimmy thinks she must
have been following me.
Your Honor...
Your Honor,
I know this sounds crazy
but I believe Mrs Toufiey
has been systematically braking
into our house and stealing things.
She stole my youngest child's
favorite toy,
a computer game
named Buddee.
Different kinds
of family photos.
My dress.
And she put wasps
in my studio.
Wasps.
There are lots of wasps around
at the moment, Mrs Hartley.
I had them at my place,
too. It's a plague.
Our neighbor saw her
braking into our house.
Is the neighbor
waiting outside?
No, she's... Maggie's elderly
and she's not feeling well
and I couldn't get her
to come here.
Your Honor,
I know what I did was wrong
and I'm sorry.
But I'm protecting
my family.
Mr Singleton,
what do you think's
been going on?
Your Honor,
my wife's under a lot
of pressure at the moment.
I'm inclined to think
that it's really my fault.
I should've done more.
Her mother passed away
recently
and I don't think
under normal circumstances
she would have broken
in like this. I, I...
She's exhausted.
She won't sleep.
How can I sleep when someone's
breaking into our house?
The Court will come to order.
You can stand down,
Mr Singleton.
I think the facts in this case
are fairly clear.
I note that neither side disputes that
Sophie Hartley was found in the household
of Mara Toufiey
and Jim Middleborough.
So I rule therefore
on this point of fact.
Please, stand, would you?
You were caught unauthorized
in the home of the complainant.
So I have no alternative but to grant
an intervention order against you.
You are prohibited from traveling
within 500 meters of Mara Toufiey,
her family,
her home,
or any place where you might
reasonably expect to find her.
And furthermore I strongly
recommend that you see counseling
at your earliest convenience.
You think I've really
let you down, don't you?
Listen, Soph,
I won't work
such long hours, you know.
Put the things
together again.
She took my dress.
The dress turned up.
She put it back.
C'mon, the dress was here all the
time. You just didn't notice it.
Soph, tell me,
you must promise me, please.
You won't follow Mara again.
John!
I'm home!
I'm early.
She bought an owl pot.
What?
I saw Mara buy an owl pot
exactly like mine.
When did you see Mara?
Why would she buy an owl pot
just like mine?
Don't you see
what it means?
You could go to jail
for this. Listen to me!
Since you've been in court, those kids
have been hiding like wounded animals.
They're not stupid. They
know something's going on.
I'm trying to protect my
family, that's why I'm doing it!
Keep away from Mara.
Stop even thinking about her.
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.
It's all about you, isn't it?
It's always about you!
We hear all about
your troubles
but since the kids were born,
you've never worried about me.
You've never been there for me.
You've never asked about me.
Can't you see I'm trying?
Sit down.
I am talking to you!
Oh, Soph, I'm sorry.
Look,
even if Mara
did do those things,
she can't do them now.
Not now.
Everything's in the open.
So you think it's possible
that she did do it.
Of course it's possible.
Why didn't you say that
in court?
Because there's absolutely
no evidence.
And Mara's my employee. I
have to think about that, too.
Fire her.
She's not indispensable.
I can't fire her.
Of course you can.
You can make up any reason...
You don't wanna fire her
because you want her around.
You think about her all the
time, don't you? You want her.
Why don't you just
admit it?
Because it's not true!
You're obsessed with her!
What's going on?
This isn't like you.
I can't meet the deadline.
It's just not worth it.
I'd like you to give
all the advanced money back.
Don't be ridiculous.
Has Craig seen these?
No, I was gonna show him
when I finished the series
but now I'm not doing
the series.
It's just not really
a very... good time for us.
Ever since my mom died, I've been
thinking constantly about what happened,
but I can't paint it.
But you have to.
Come on, sweetie.
Alright. Look, I know
that it tastes horrible,
but... I'll just do it fast and then we'll
chase it down with something sweet, okay?
C'mon, that's it!
Good girI.
Are you giving her more?
You just gave her that
about ten minutes ago.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did, mommy.
Oh, my God.
Craig!
Craig!
What?
Call the ambulance. I think I
overdosed Elly. I gave her two times.
I didn't remember. I
didn't know. Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
Mommy.
Mommy!
I'm right here. I'm so sorry,
sweetie. Mommy's right here.
Oh, that's a girI.
It's okay. It's only kids'
medicine. It's not strong.
We'll get it out of her
system. She'll be fine.
That's a girI.
Why are you crying
such big tears
out of those beautiful eyes?
Well, because they have to spin
all this straw into gold
or the king will kill
me at sunrise. Oh, no.
Mom, can Rumpelstilskin
be a cat, too?
I think so, yeah.
Craig?
Hello?
Boo!
Oh, oh! My goodness. You frightened me.
You are better, slacker.
We've got you a place in
the country so you can work.
Daddy's taking time off
to look after us.
Yeah. Ruby and I felt it
was time you had a break,
so Jen is lending us
her cottage.
It's not far
and it's quiet there.
You can sleep
and finish your paintings.
We'll come down
on the weekend.
Well, I thought
you could leave on Wednesday.
Today's Wednesday.
No, today is Tuesday.
Okay.
Hello?
Is that mommy?
Craig!
Craig!
What the fuck
is she doing in my house?
Sophie, calm down. Mara's
come around to do some work.
We're gonna finish
some plans.
Don't you let her get
anywhere near mi giris!
Sophie?
Where is she?
Is she still here?
Of course she's not.
I'm sorry.
Are you changing the sheets?
I can't believe this.
This is unbelievable.
In our bed with the giris
still in the house?
Mara has not been in this room. Please!
Alright, you leave. You go with
her. Go with your girlfriend.
Get out! I don't want
you in here. Get out!
That's it, go!
You are forcing me
to say this.
I don't think the giris
are safe here.
Don't make this about me.
You've given
the wrong medicine.
You're the one that's crazy
'cause you won't listen!
Calm down!
I am fucking calm!
Daddy?
Go to bed, Elly.
I'm not Elly.
Ruby.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
We got a little loud. It's
okay, honey. Come here.
Come to mamma.
Come here.
I hate you.
It's alright, darling.
Where are we going, daddy?
We're going
to Jen's cottage.
Mommy!
Oh!
I missed you.
I missed you too, sweetie.
Okay, well, uhm...
I'm gonna go get the car. Right?
Bye, dad.
Is that the date
for my shrink evaluation?
It's the day after we
get back on Thursday.
Hey, Elly, not so far out!
These supervised visits
are nonsense.
You'll pass
with fine colors, Soph.
Thanks.
You and Craig will sort
things out. He'll be back.
I'm glad we're here, anyway.
I think I'll even get some
petunias when we get home
and you can help me
plant them.
Okay.
How's work going?
It's not, really.
I, uh...
Lately I've been thinking
a lot about what happened
and I had hoped to maybe
put us in the book
but now I've decided
against doing it at all.
What you do
is your business, Sophie.
That sure wasn't true
a while back, was it?
You were the one
that decided
that we would be yanked from
New York and all my friends.
You were only a child.
Yeah. Not so much for a child
that I couldn't get pregnant.
You're not smoking again.
You just said
it was my business.
So... who was the father?
Look, it hardly matters now
but your mother,
she asked
just before she died.
Mom asked that?
Was it that boyfriend
of yours, Michael?
No, it wasn't Michael.
It was the prom and we went to
a hotel. Everybody was drinking.
I didn't even know what was going
on. Michael got angry, he left.
There was this guy there.
Nobody knew him.
He was a friend
of a friend of a friend.
I don't even remember
what he looked like.
I was afraid to...
I was afraid to tell you because I just
thought that'd make everything worse
and mom was so unhappy.
And you were so angry.
I don't... even know
his name, dad.
Stop, stop!
Ruby?
Good luck tomorrow
for the evaluation.
Thanks.
You sure I can't drive you?
No, I'm fine.
Ginger!
Ginger Tom!
Ginger!
Come here, boy!
Ginger!
Here, Ginger.
Ginger Tom.
Come here, Ginger.
I haven't seen him
since you left.
I put some food out
but he hasn't taken it, Debbie.
I do hope
he's alright.
Oh, my God.
Ginger!
Ginger Tom!
Come here boy.
Ginger!
Ginger Tom.
Ginger!
Ginger Tom! Ginger Tommy. Ginger!
Ginger?
Ginger To...
Ginger?
Tommy?
Ginger?
Come here, boy.
Come here.
Mara, I thought
you'd gone to work.
I'm just gonna check
down here.
You know you're the most
talented one here.
I know you are, anyway.
What have I done now?
Well, I was just fixing
Jen's Internet
and I couldn't help noticing her
emails. One email in particular
mentioning an esteemed partner,
Mr Craig Singleton.
The mighty Quinns' are incredibly
pleased with their house.
They love the textured lighting
in the music room so much.
So, they've talked to their
mate Christos into giving you
the commissi√≥n!
No.
You've won it!
You've won it!
Jen's out now buying champagne and the Quinns'
are insisting on telling you themselves!
That's why they're coming ro... I
thought they wanted more bloody changes!
Congratulations.
It is so great when it happens
to somebody who deserves it.
I'm so proud of you.
There'll be green belts
and legs.
It's solar power and light.
It'll be... it'll be beautiful.
Just a sec.
I can't do this.
Trust me.
Oh, come on.
Fuck me.
Craig, your school
is on line one.
Hello?
I'm so sorry.
I've been held up.
I'll be there right away.
Is something wrong?
I completely forgot
about the giris.
Don't, Craig. You have
to take that meeting.
I'll pick the kids up.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Giris!
Hi, giris.
Hop in.
Your dad sent me.
This is like the car
Grandpa wants to buy.
Is it?
Is it yours?
No, it's Jimmy's car.
Come inside.
I'll cook, if you like.
I've got two minutes.
Are you up to go in?
Love you.
Just slay'em.

Elly!
Pst, Elly.
Elly.
Elly.
# Mystery #
# come to me #
Elly!
Elly!
Ruby!
Elly!
What have you done now, Sophie?
You've broken in
to my house again?
Are you aware
of what this means?
I'm gonna make it
so hard for you.
You are so good.
You even had me convinced
I was crazy.
You are.
It's my word against yours.
Let's just go upstairs
and talk this thing through.
I know everything
I need to.
Are you afraid?
I think you're afraid that
I'm gonna reject you again.
It must have been horrible.
Then you get your hopes up
and you're imagining
all that time who I am
and then you finally find me
and I'm pregnant with Elly.
You poor thing.
You know, I thought
about you all the time.
When they first
took you away from me,
after that I would sneak back
to the children's home
night after night
and I'd hide,
wondering if you
were still in there.
You know, under that big tree
where the owl was all the time.
And now, look at you.
You are so beautiful.
And accomplished.
And you have Jimmy
and Jess.
Jess is Jimmy's daughter,
not mine.
I'm a liar,
just like you.
I am so sorry.
# Crazy #
# I'll make you crazy #
It's Ginger Tom.
He's mine!
No, he's not.
He's ours.
Hi, kids.
Dad, Ginger Tom
is our cat, isn't he?
God!
Oh, God!
Get everyone out.
Is Jessy with Mara?
I don't know where Mara is. Come on!
Stand right there.
Mr Singleton?
If you want me, we can
get rid of the clothes.
We have emptied
the pockets for you.
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?
She won't wake
'till the morning.
The giris are with your dad.
They're still asleep.
I have something
that I have to tell you.
No, Soph,
I already know.
What?
They gave me your stuff last night
and I saw the birth certificate.
I am so sorry.
I should've told you
from the very beginning.
I waited in the longer,
I waited the harder.
It's me that
should be sorry.
I did wanna tell you.
I felt so ashamed, though.
It's fine.
It always
would've been fine.
I don't want anymore secrets between us.
How are the giris?
They're confused
and shaken.
They'll be better
when you're home.
And Mara?
Soph, there's something I
need to tell you about Mara.
The past is the past.
Let's start fresh.
I love you.
How is she?
Does she have visitors?
I don't think
you should see her.
She's confused
and dangerous.
I don't want you to go
anywhere near her.
Please.
You think you can just march
in here after all this time?
I came to ask
your permissi√≥n
to put you in the book
that I'm doing.
I have to write a text
to go with my pictures.
I wanna write about us.
I was just a... scared kid
when they made me
give you away.
Later, when you came
to find me, I...
I don't have an excuse.
I was stuck in a children's
home 'till I was ten.
I was just fostered out over
and over like an unwanted dog.
You have every right
to be angry with me.
You were very brave
to seek me out.
I was a coward.
You don't know me.
You don't know anything.
You're right,
I don't know you.
And that's my loss.
I'm sorry.
Can you forgive me?
It's alright.
It's okay.
I'm here.
I won't leave you again.
Do you promise?
I promise.
Cross your heart
and hope to die.
Hope to die.
You can't be in here.
Were you signed in?
Are you on the list?
I'm her mother.
Have you taken
your medication?
Yes, yeah.
I'm just doing
a bit of filing.
Oh. The bidding is about to close.
I had one of those, Kate.
You can share mine, Mara.
You can take anything of mine.
Cross your heart
and hope to die.
Cross my heart
and hope to die.
