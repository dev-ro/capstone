FEDERAL POLICE
NO PARKING
MY NAME ISN'T JOHNNY
Sorry.
Good morning.
You must be...
Maria Luiza.
Joâo Guilherme's mother.
Renato.
How are you?
As well as a mother could be
when she finds out that her son
is in a situation like this.
JOHNNY ARRESTED, LAST LINK
IN THE NELORE CONNECTION
Since Joâo Guilherme
was arrested,
I'm scared to death of the
police coming to my house
after me, I don't know...
You need to speak to police
as soon as possible.
So you'll have to advise me,
so I won't say anything stupid.
The only time
I was a witness was in this
car crash with my sister.
You think he'll be in jail
for very long?
The situation is quite serious.
Mrs. Maria Luiza,
how long have you known
of your son's involvement
with this kind of...
...activity?
I could never imagine.
Not in my worst nightmare.
Not in our family.
GOOD-BYE, OLD HOUSE
Maria, I'll take Joâo
to school.
Speaking of school, the principal
called me again.
She's worried about
Joâo Guilherme's behavior.
What did she say?
She said he has good grades
for his school work,
but he's always the leader
in all the trouble.
Dear Lord.
Why did you throw a cherry bomb
in the living room?
- They made a goal.
- Who did?
- Vasco.
- Vasco? Who did it?
- Felix.
- What's the score?
Two nil. It's about to end.
Then we're in the finals.
Game on Sunday at "Maracanâ".
I got all of West Germany.
And you?
- Waimea. Incredible, huh?
- Dad,
I had a great idea.
I know how
- to be richer than you.
- That's not hard,
but go on, tell me.
Surfing.
Julinho is good at it.
He'll teach me,
- won't you?
- Sure, just say when.
So, Dad, are you giving me
the surfboard?
I'm not a guy
to give the fish for free.
- I want a board, not a fish.
- Son, I won't give you the fish.
I'll teach you how to fish.
PORN MOVIE
For me, God created school
on the seventh day.
And the Devil
the beach on the eighth.
On the eighth day,
the devil created this thing.
- So full of surprises.
- Like a girl.
Hey, Rubâo, you have the weed?
- I have some for you.
- You got it?
- Yeah, cool.
- But don't take it to school.
Thanks. That's why I like you.
- Want some, Joâo?
- No, thanks.
Why? What are
you afraid of?
Dad says lots of criminals
don't smoke weed.
But if you smoke weed,
you usually are a criminal.
You still believe your father?
What do you think will happen
because of a little weed?
- I don't know. Go crazy.
- You're already crazy.
Okay, go crazier.
My brother is 17, he's smoked
since he was 15,
and he just got into college,
Engineering.
See, he went nuts.
Give me some
of that shit.
Come on, son. Do you have to
eat like a crazed baboon?
Take it easy.
The doctor said I'm now
in this fight without one lung.
You should face today
as the beginning of a new life.
I think it's the end
of an old life.
The doctor's obligation
is to fight to the last cell.
You yourself said
this is a war.
You're going in to lose?
I don't want
to fight this war.
Then you'll lose,
because you're already in it.
It's not possible.
I don't understand you.
I'm at my limit.
What are you doing
with your life?
With our lives, everybody's lives.
I can't take it anymore.
Joâo, talk to me. Aren't you
going to say anything?
It's okay, Joâo.
It happens in every family.
It already has, Laura.
My mom says she's splitting.
Just taking some time
to find another place.
She doesn't want to be here.
But they're still arguing.
My father is very sad.
So is your mom.
But you like him a lot.
Really a lot.
I won't stay with you like this.
It's over for me. Over.
You can do whatever you want.
Joâo, the boy doesn't have
to go through this.
I really don't have to, okay?
Joâo.
Joâo.
Joâo!
Joâo.
- Hey, Julinho, want some?
- No, I'm allergic to iodine.
- Laurinha, want some?
- I'm allergic to Paraguay.
What's wrong with your dad?
Laurita, my dad's all wrong.
I think it's the cigarettes.
His lungs, blood pressure,
he's all sick, man.
Cigarettes are fucking poison, man.
You have one, Joâo?
Hey, the drummer is missing the
beat or is it someone at the door?
No, it's someone at the door.
Go get it.
Hey, Bacteria.
Open the door, bro.
What does this Bacteria do?
I don't know. But he opens
doors real good.
That's one thing he does good,
open doors.
Are you interested in Bacteria?
- I'm just asking, Joâo.
- Are you into him?
Man, I've been banging
on the door for a long time.
- Hey there, Brunâo.
- Where's the dope?
- Say hi.
- Say hi, Mr. Anxiety.
Here it is.
But I'm five bucks short
from each of you.
- Fucking taxes.
- But look,
if you took longer, you could bring
bread and the paper.
It's this Tainha guy
who's all mixed up.
Why don't you set him straight?
Things are complicated.
Next time, one of you goes.
Julinho goes.
Julinho is good at that.
It's going to crimp my work.
What work, dude?
You're still in school.
- Laurita, are you going?
- Guys, I'm a girl.
I'll go.
I talk to the guy, set him
straight. Have a talk.
What's the big deal?
No, Julinho, you don't get it.
I have to meet the guy alone
and take the money.
Lend me some.
You can give me some.
You're leaving me
in the lurch?
That's what you're doing.
Bro, I'm not gonna talk to...
Hey, Tainha.
- Are you asking for my hand?
- What's that for, bro?
Just five grams, bro?
I could be at home,
on my chair, watching Magnum,
gorging on cookies,
smoking weed and shit.
But no. I come all the way from
Jacarepaguá to the south zone
and you come in later
that a bride.
- Did you bring the money?
- I don't have the money.
Okay, anything else?
Gold? Some merchandise?
Your sister.
Your sister came?
Let's do like this.
You leave the shit with me.
We meet here again
in three days, same time.
I'll be here, guaranteed.
You know the penalty for bums
who don't keep their word?
Don't sweat it.
There's no forgiveness,
no pity.
Shake my hand. Here's the shit.
You pay the bill.
Hey, bro, how are you?
Awesome, dude.
What about these losers?
These losers
will pay for this.
I have to pay Tainha
on Tuesday.
Are you going to pay for me?
Are you paying my bills?
Put gasoline in my car?
The way you're going, you'll go
far. But very far from me.
- What are you smoking?
- Nothing much.
- Hey there, man.
- How are you?
- Do you know Sofia?
- No.
- Sofia, this is Joâo.
- How are you?
You're the famous Joâo Estrella?
Famous, it's good to be famous?
I don't know,
but fame can be good.
I'm like a dog
at a butcher shop.
What's happening, man?
Dog at a butcher shop, drooling,
dying for a steak, get it?
Are you hungry?
No, bro, I'm talking
about that ivory goddess.
Man, I'm stuck to this sofa.
I'm not leaving this spot.
What the hell
are you talking about?
What's with the dog,
the steak, the ivory?
Forget it, dude.
Leave it be.
She's so beautiful, man.
- And the skirt and those legs.
- She's wearing pants.
- Fuck, pants?
- What woman are you talking about?
Any one of them.
I'm talking about Sofia. That hot
chick that came with Brunâo.
Yeah, right,
she's hot.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, son.
- Trying to figure a move?
- Yeah, trying to keep in shape.
Let me see.
Hey, you messed up.
- Really?
- Yeah, look. Say good-bye.
You're very rushed here.
I thought I'd done
this great strategic play.
Yeah, huh?
It's real lively downstairs.
It's great.
The gang's all here.
Want me to get you a drink?
No, thanks.
I'm going to try and sleep.
Okay, Dad.
I'm going downstairs.
Go on, son, have fun.
Look, time is a fox, son.
When you wake up, it's taken
everything from you.
Thanks, bro.
Say hi to your brother for me.
- That's a real bum.
- Hey, man, you came in early, dude.
I'm more punctual
than a Swiss clock.
You brought the greenbacks,
the cash...
- Right here.
- The dough?
I've even got dollars there.
Go ahead, count it.
Come on, I'm not counting.
That's so crass.
Imagine that.
Why should I count?
It's all good.
- Is there something missing?
- Yes there is.
You telling me how much
you want next time.
You're on the other team now,
behind the counter.
On this side of the store.
Brunâo went crazy, too.
He banged up all the clubs
in Niterói because of Sofia.
Let's say all the clubs in Niterói
are just one. And it's bad.
- Look, my ivory goddess.
- What kind of goddess?
- Ivory, stupid.
- She lost the big boy from Niterói.
Pay attention, dude.
They say the big boy from
Niterói is putty in her hands.
What's this about being putty?
What's that?
Is she a dancer?
She's a dancer, a hormonal
operator, very forward.
Makes a guy lose his sleep?
I'm gonna talk to her.
- Hey, Sofia.
- Joâo Guilherme.
- How are you?
- Long time.
- What's up?
- Everything's fine.
- And Brunâo?
- What about him?
He's... having fun in Niterói,
doing stuff, I don't know.
You want to know
if we're together.
Yeah, I'd like that.
You're always like this? Circle
around to get to know someone?
It's just that it's you.
I get nervous talking to you.
- It's kind of cool.
- Then I'll keep being nervous.
But then the worid
can end tomorrow.
We have to enjoy life.
So I'll help you.
Want to go out with me?
Isn't it better to go
before the worid ends?
You always have
the house to yourself?
Yeah, more and more.
And your dad?
He's more like a neighbor.
He's always upstairs,
doing his stuff.
And I stay down here.
This house is really cool.
Cheers to us.
What do you do, Joâo?
I don't do anything. But I'm good
at not doing anything.
Man, there's this crazy thing
I think of sometimes.
- Tell me.
- I don't know.
You're in this place and...
Hi, bro. Your problem is
this car. It's a six-cylinder.
I had one. It's a real problem.
It's a four cylinder.
Fuck, man.
The problem is me waiting
here over half an hour.
Three guys stopped here
to check me out.
Are you nuts?
Get in quick to pick up
the shit. Go.
Go on. Quick, quick.
Hey, bro, next time,
you tell me ahead of time.
I can't do this last minute.
Sorry, dude.
Things are kinda crazy.
Night falls and my phone
rings like 20 times.
Hey, you're Joâo,
Tainha's partner?
- That depends. Why?
- I have a message for you.
But if you're gonna do this
maybe yes, maybe no shit,
things will be bad
for me and for you.
Look, if I'm Joâo, I'll understand
what you say. What's the beef?
- It's over. Tainha was caught.
- I get it, bro.
Joâo.
There's no Joâo today.
We'll talk later.
Hey, Joâo, what is it?
That guy said the well has dried.
- Tainha was caught.
- Well? What guy?
- What is it, Joâo?
- Tainha, babe, my contact.
They arrested the guy.
I'm royally screwed.
That's a perfect excuse
so you leave this shit.
It's getting dangerous.
Imagine if he has a daybook
with the numbers of his clients?
If he has one, I'll buy it.
It's worth gold.
Who's gonna pay
my bills? You?
You talk like this were like
selling bracelets at school.
- This is cocaine.
- Yeah, say it a little louder.
Cocaine is an illegal
substance, as far as I know.
- It'll land you in jail.
- And what do I do
with all those people calling me,
wanting this illegal substance?
- Tell them to call you?
- It's one thing to use it.
It's another to lead your life.
You make your life off this.
Actually, you're losing money.
You spend your profit on parties
for these losers
who go buy at your house.
Did someone drop
acid in his beer?
He's on my case. Get off me,
go bug your mother.
Come on in.
Are you studying, son?
I'm studying real hard.
Real hard.
- And what's your major?
- Communications.
Communications?
That's lovely.
My grandson, Joâo Vicente,
got into Communication studies
and he's loving it.
He says it's great.
My other grandson, Carlos
Armando, studied Engineering.
Mrs. Marly,
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I'll get it for you.
Just a moment.
Here, Joâo Guilherme,
here it is.
- It's a good quantity.
- Yeah, good.
Don't forget,
for God's sake.
When you speak on the phone,
use the word ambrosia.
- Ambrosia.
- Ambrosia. Mrs. Marly,
you have to be careful.
The police
might show up to eat ambrosia,
because I ask for it so much.
- Don't you want a jar?
- No, thanks. I have to go.
God bless you.
You be careful, okay?
- The view is excellent.
- There's a view to Lagoa?
No, but you can see the police.
Great neighborhood.
I loved it.
It's safe at least.
It's great.
If we're out of sugar,
we can ask them for more.
I mean, actual sugar.
Yeah.
Let's see the rest
of the apartment.
- So you liked the apartment?
- It's excellent.
Don't you want to see
the kitchen and service areas?
No, no, no. Thanks.
I'm not going there.
This is the best.
I don't want to see another.
Let's see about the papers.
I'll give you a list,
and if everything if okay,
in a week at most,
you'll be moving in.
A week? I thought we could do it
today. Can't we?
No, hon. There's the paperwork.
It's part of his job.
But a mattress and a CD player,
can't we do that?
Honey, you don't get it.
He's a great pro.
You can't do that.
You have to wise up. He's great.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Ambrosia, hon?
- Ambrosia for you, too.
- Ambrosia? I love ambrosia.
- I love ambrosia, too.
It's like beans in this house.
Look, this is
the card of destruction.
It's like everything
is collapsing around you.
Collapsing?
What do you mean?
It's an extinction happening
in your aura.
- What do I have to do?
- Sessions of herbal baths.
Herbal baths?
Sure, herbal baths.
- And when can I do those?
- Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
Seven herbs for
seven consecutive days.
- And where can I do this?
- We have a bathtub right here.
That's great.
So we start Tuesday?
- Tuesday, four o'clock.
- Thanks.
It's nothing.
Look, keep some
of those herbs for me.
And I want some of what
you put in her glass.
She's my best client.
The husband abandoned her
to live with 8 Chihuahuas.
- Live with who?
- Eight Chihuahuas.
Chihuahuas? That ugly dog?
Eight inside the house?
That old lady is depressing.
I don't want his turning into
- a therapist's office.
- Why not?
It helps with expenses.
Which are huge, by the way.
I've never seen anyone make so much
money and spend it all so fast.
So you're gonna rip off
these old ladies?
Yeah.
Hon, there's enough acetone and
ether here to clean all the wounds
from the Korean War.
All these old farts and furious
ladies aren't gonna work.
Let me look at the cards.
Stop, you don't know
how to use them.
Joâo!
Joâo Estrella!
- What's that?
- It's someone calling me.
- No kidding, Joâo.
- Joâo Estrella.
I'll go see.
Joâo!
Hey, Joâo.
Can't you tell this nut
that it's Monday
and we're neighbors
with the police?
Joâo.
It's me.
Hey, man, cut out the noise.
I'm sorry, bro.
I'm really sorry.
You're going to work now?
I'm going straight
to the practice.
You're going to see people?
Who's gonna see you?
That's the question
that won't go away.
Who is the psycho who is going
to let you shrink his head, man?
If somebody calls to make an
appointment, he won't be able to.
I let go my secretary.
- Sell me five grams.
- I have two grams here.
These 5 grams
are for these people.
- I closed shop today.
- Let's trade.
You give me the five and give
the two grams to the rest.
Come on, Joâo.
Give me a break.
I got your money.
What's the difference...
Don't raise
your voice in my house.
I'm not shouting. My money, their
money, what's the difference?
I'm paying you cash,
no checks.
Don't raise your fucking voice
in my house.
I'm not screaming,
I'm whispering.
I got to come out of here
with this
or I'm going to the slum,
to fuck knows where,
but I'm not leaving
without this shit.
Man, I'm not
giving you anything.
You're talking shit,
fucking bugging me.
Take these 5 grams and
get out of here, you fucker.
I'm not selling to you anymore. Get
away from me. You die away from me.
Joâo, I tell you.
You're like a brother to me.
Can I have these two also?
Get out of my sight,
out of my home, dude.
Here, such a fuss.
- Here's your ambrosia.
- Thanks, Mrs. Marly.
You're eating so much
I can't supply you anymore.
You better find another supplier,
a heftier one. Another contact.
Here, it's a person I know.
Hide that.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Thank you, Mrs. Marly.
- Where is it? There?
- No, it's there.
- There?
- Exactly.
COURT HOUSE
POLICE
Eye on it.
- Good afternoon, friend.
- Good afternoon.
Are you in charge
of Mrs. Marly's case?
Yes, I am.
Have a sit, please.
- A very sad case.
- Truly sad.
I really like Mrs. Marly.
- A very pure person.
- Very pure.
- Extremely pure.
- I'm in kind of a rush.
Could I see her file, please?
Miss Laura,
please close the door.
It's a very heavy file.
Two thousand pages.
Two kilos... of pages.
Don't you want to try first?
It wouldn't be prudent.
Out of curiosity,
what is it's origin?
The frontier sector.
It's all entrusted to a DA
that deals with the case.
The file.
You don't want to try it?
No, friend, I have to go.
I didn't eat anything today.
Me neither.
And I won't.
- Hey, buddies.
- Hey.
Who are you
exorcising, preacher?
I'm exorcising all of you.
Man, what's with the suit?
Hey, how's the record going?
Thank God, you came, man.
We've recorded
the same track 34 times.
The same track 34 times? Then have
a snort and record it 45 times.
I want to know if my name
is going to be in the credits.
- We'll give your name to it.
- So start up, guys.
Go, man, go!
Why are you snorting the floor
with all this blow here?
Happy birthday.
Thanks, I'll eat some in a minute.
Hey, mom. A gift for you.
- Thank you, son
- Hope you like it.
Your birthday gift.
It's beautiful.
But you're nuts.
It must have cost
an arm and a leg.
An arm, a leg, a mouth and what's
left of shame on this face.
- It's lovely.
- It's nice, huh?
Joâo Guilherme is doing well,
making a lot of money.
What is he doing?
I'm not sure. I think
he's working in sales.
And he's successful.
My Helinho, poor thing.
Two college degrees,
a master's degree, and he lives
in a one room flat,
rides the bus and is always
asking for loans.
- What can you do?
- Mercury in the seventh house.
Things are changing
for everyone.
- Who in what house?
- No, seventh house. Mercury.
Good things for good people
in the know.
She's into tarot.
You know, cards.
Okay, dude, I'll be there
in 15 minutes. Okay.
- Police.
- It's over, playboy.
- Freeze, police.
- I said, police.
- Good night.
- Good night my ass.
- Hands on your head, asshole.
- Take it easy, Wanderley.
You'll wake people up.
Discretion, okay?
I think there's been a mistake.
- Raise your hands, damn it.
- C'mon, Wanderley,
it sounds like
you're getting arrested.
There's no misunderstanding,
they gave you up.
I don't understand.
Let's skip the protocol
and cut to the chase.
Take off your shoes.
Hand over the blow already.
C'mon, Wanderley.
Which foot am I shooting off?
I don't have time to lose.
I said they gave you up.
Hand it to me.
C'mon, hand it over.
That's all I have.
What's the next step?
Are you in a hurry, friend?
I just want to resolve this
in the least tragic manner.
Relax, there's more tragedy ahead.
- More?
- We'll talk about it soon.
Now, we're making you a visit
to pick up all the shit.
I don't have anything at home.
Only what you're seeing.
If you've got nothing,
then don't sweat it. We go up,
you serve us coffee and sandwiches,
settle this shit and it's over.
You've got a warrant?
Warrant?
Here's the warrant.
Is it good enough for you?
Automatic 9mm warrant
by Judge Smith and Wesson.
Is it good enough or
do you want to hear it talk?
I'm gonna ask you a favor
and light these candles, please.
Hey, they cut your light?
I didn't pay the bill, so...
Those guys are assholes.
They don't care
if you've got baby formula
in the fridge,
your sick mother's medicine,
everything spoiling.
They really
don't give a shit.
I can connect you
to the grid, if you like.
Wanderley, don't start that shit.
Let's go to the living room.
We'll toss the drawers.
- Get that thing out of my face.
- Just help me here.
Thanks, guys, thanks.
If you have anything better,
you should hand it over.
I'm telling you,
there's nothing here.
Give me that.
Wanderley,
look in those drawers.
Hey, watch the noise,
my wife is sleeping
and she'll get real upset.
- Please.
- This door is real hard.
Wanderley, you'll wake up
the guy's wife.
You're wasting your time.
Break everything,
there's nothing there.
Hey, Wadâo,
there's blow here.
I was told you had 100 thousand
dollars in the house.
- You think I'm gonna have...
- You'll wake her up.
I don't have 30 bucks
to pay my light bill.
- I'm gonna have 100 thousand?
- Then how much do you have?
I don't have anything.
You said you had nothing
in the living room, but...
You want to die, man?
Look at my situation.
You saw my shitty sound.
I couldn't make your sandwich.
You saw my car, you think
I have 100 thousand?
So what are you doing
in this business?
Wanderley, go fuck your...
What are you doing
in this business?
Your informants
are misinformed.
I'm not leaving here
with nothing, no way.
Me neither.
I can try to sell some.
My phone was cut too.
Nothing works in this house.
Look, I work in the street.
We can go out,
I'll try to raise
money from some clients.
Okay, we'll take you with us.
But if this is bullshit,
you better kiss your wife,
your friends,
your doorman good-bye.
You'll spend 30 years away.
Hey, man, it ain't easy.
Nobody said it was easy. If it were
easy I'd do it myself.
- I'm fucking hungry.
- Me, too.
Let's eat something.
What's open at this hour?
The Pizza Esplendor
at Flamengo.
That place is awful.
The pizza is crap.
Who asked you anything, kid?
Wanderley, really,
the pizza is really bad.
It's like leather
with cheese on top.
But it's nice there.
That TV actor, Francisco Cuoco,
is always there.
Big fucking deal. Just because the
guy is famous, the pizza is good?
Are you going to eat
or ask for an autograph?
I asked him one day,
but he was in a hurry.
And it's not Cuoco.
It's Tarcísio Meira.
- Francisco Cuoco.
- Tarcísio Meira.
- He's Francisco Cuoco.
- I saw the fucking soap.
Come on, guys.
- Let's go to Elza's?
- All right, get in.
Look, in three days,
I come get the money
and take it there, no mistake.
I can skip the part
about what happens...
Sure, where I live, my car tags,
you know all that.
All right.
Let's pay the check.
- It's 45.
- Shut up, Wanderley, fuck.
It's 15 each.
I got 4 bucks here.
Include it in what I owe you.
I'm gonna take a leak.
He thinks he's a smart ass, uh?
- Good night.
- Good night, partner.
We're your colleagues
from the civilian police.
You friends will pardon me,
but we received a call.
A call? It was the barkeep.
He thought we looked
like criminals.
Figured we were going
to rob the joint?
But it was a call. You know
I have to investigate.
This is just routine.
It was a misunderstanding.
Right, barkeep?
We can solve this with
a few beers, huh?
That guy is with you?
He's in the force, too.
Investigator De Paula. Come over.
Good night.
How are you?
Had to take a leak, De Paula?
I can see it's a
misunderstanding.
Looks like it.
- Yeah, looks like it.
- Yeah.
Well, since its nothing.
Good night.
- Sorry about the confusión.
- Have a good day.
- It's his job.
- He's doing his duty.
Think of it as an investment.
You're not lending me money.
You give me the money
and I'll give it back.
It's a business deal
I'm having with you.
Now I'm investing
in trouble?
No, you give me the money. I get it
back in 15 days plus 10% on top.
Where can you get
interest rates like that?
Commodities and
this shit you do.
What do you know about that?
I know a lot. I'm always selling
to your stock market friends.
Are you crazy?
Why do you think they're always
screaming, running around?
Those guys are all high, bro. This
is a business deal, business.
Okay, I'll lend the money
- because you're my friend.
- Thanks, bro.
You cash this check.
Don't leave it in the hands
of those bastards.
The bastard's phone is cut,
he didn't pay the bill.
Man, is he not showing up?
Does he want to get killed?
- Guys, this is all I got.
- Man, don't do that.
- I have a heart condition.
- Sorry, this is all I got.
- We agreed on more.
- Yeah, I know,
we agreed.
But that's all I got.
If you can get this,
you can get the rest.
I can't.
Fuck, Wanderley,
I didn't ask you.
Okay, bro,
let's leave it at that.
- So we're done?
- We're done.
We won't bother you anymore.
- Great. Thanks.
- Thanks.
Hey.
- Say it.
- No, you say it.
- Go ahead, say it.
- You say it, man.
Would you be interested
in buying your drugs back?
I'm out, bro,
I've left the business.
Hey, guys!
Rio de Janeiro is ours!
Where's the birthday boy?
I haven't talked to him yet.
There are a hundred people
around him. It's hell.
Sofia, come here.
This next song is for her.
My muse, my baby...
My curvy legs.
You were the greatest
of my affairs
The greatest of hugs
I never forgot
You were
of the loves I had
The most complicated
and the simplest for me
I forgot
to try to forget
I decided to want you
because I wanted you
I decided to love you
so many times
I have the will
and nothing to lose
My baby
You were all the happiness
and all the evil
That did me very...
You were
the best of my plans
And the worst mistake
I could make
Of the memories
I carry in life
You're the longing
I like to have
Only then can I feel you
close to me again
My love
My baby
Sofia, I have to steal
your husband for a sec.
I promise to bring him back
intact in 10 minutes.
No, not now, really.
You may not know me, but I'm
very well informed and
have great references of you.
I believe you,
but as you can see,
I don't think I have to change
my operation.
Man, I've participated in
several parties like this one.
But a good seller of yams
can have a party like this.
I'm talking about something bigger.
Much larger.
I have the purest merchandise
in the country.
It comes straight
from the lab to you.
Why do you think
I'm the right guy?
You have the best people
right in your hands.
People who like quality.
Here's my card.
Call me anytime.
- Nelore.
- Nerole.
- Nelore.
- Nelore.
- Nelore.
- Yeah...
Isn't that the name
of a kind of cattle?
It is.
The picture of your goddaughter
with Bozo.
Real cute, with the tooth and all.
With Bozo.
- That perv.
- He's a perv.
That clown never convinced me.
Man, he's a real perv.
Yeah.
- Hey, leave a little for me.
- Joâo Estrella!
How are you? Selling fish, Joâo.
Remember me?
How are you?
Everything okay?
Do you have
some salmon for me?
- How did you find me?
- News travel fast.
And the hits
just keep on coming.
This is my partner.
He's like a brother.
Someone told me about
the purity, I had to check it out.
Birds who sniff stones,
know the nose they have.
I don't sell small quantities
anymore. Scram.
What's your minimum?
Tell me.
My minimum now
is too much for you.
You have 50 grams?
I'll pay.
Let me explain something.
I'm not selling to you.
Not even the minimum.
Everyone has a price.
The police has a price.
If they have a price,
dealers have one too.
Read my lips.
I'm not selling to you anymore.
Not a gram. Not a line, get it?
Joâo, you're going
to regret it.
Look, you're going
to regret it.
I'm not kidding.
You listen to me.
I don't believe you said that.
It's just like César.
Smiley.
Let's go?
Joâo, this is Felipe,
from Barcelona.
He's a friend
of my cousin, César.
It must be nice there.
Let's get going?
No. It's sunny.
I'm not going anywhere.
You're going to broil.
Can we go now?
Okay, but if it's a show
of jealousy,
you better know Felipe
is more interested in you.
I don't want to bother you.
But let's have a drink.
I have some connections
in Europe from Barcelona.
I bring some stuff over.
Ecstasy, DMA, Skank.
I see. You want me to take
my business there.
Europe pays good money,
only consumes pure stuff.
And how much
will we make?
Enough to make it
worthwhile.
And what's that to you?
Enough to run a risk
of this kind.
Talk numbers with me.
Five to six figures.
Five to six figures.
Don't wanna get burned?
Don't play with fire.
You don't look good, Joâo.
You're telling me.
I've been up three days.
You move that shit.
Don't let it move you.
You make money off it.
Don't let it control you.
Wait, you're not walking out
with the shit in that bag.
It's cool, dude.
This is to trick the nose of
the sniffer dogs. Come here.
We go on the same flight,
but we pretend
- we don't know each other.
- Separate places on the plane.
- Right, I go first class.
- I go executive.
You've never been to Europe.
You gonna bug me now?
- I'm going with the dogs?
- Yeah, with your cousins.
You go to Madrid and I'll see you
at the meeting point.
Step back, please.
You can go.
Have a nice flight.
- It's the second.
- It must be really cheap.
It's a pleasure
working with you.
For me, too. Let me know about next
time, and I am ready for it.
Man, I'm close to my goal.
Your goal? What is it?
It's to make a million dollars.
Yours?
Mine is to spend
a million dollars.
- Luck.
- Luck.
See the money.
Let's spend it all in Europe.
Go, honey.
Police.
What now?
You're going outside? Come back.
Don't leave me here alone.
Your ID, sir?
Good night.
How are you?
- Are you from Brazil?
- Yeah, Brazil.
- Do you have drugs with you?
- Drugs, no?
We're getting married. We came
here for our honeymoon
in Barcelona. We love it here
and are very happy.
We want to have children. And
travel a lot, because we like it.
- Never do that again.
- What did you tell them?
VENICE
You sign there, because I'm beat.
I'm going to bed to sleep.
The bellboy went on ahead
with the key.
Bye.
I didn't understand.
Do you live here or are
you traveling for pleasure?
I don't understand
what you're saying.
What?
I don't need a handkerchief.
Excuse me.
I'm not opening.
I'm not opening the door.
I don't care. You do what you want.
Get a gondola
to sleep with that blonde giraffe.
You bastard! Clown!
How can you leave me
out in the cold?
You're imagining things.
He was a childhood friend
who turned into a tranny.
Carlinhos, who studied
with me in seventh grade.
It's been 12 years
and now he's Alessandra.
I don't know how
to deal with him.
Shut up, Joâo.
- Curvy legs of my life.
- You stink.
- You're gross.
- I'm stinking.
I'm getting under the covers
with my boots on and tuddi.
- It's "tutti", stupid.
I'm going to come to bed
in my boots and tutti
close to my curvy legs.
We're in Venice.
Let's not fight.
The old trick of evoking unbearable
songs to inspire the couples.
You heard him?
Marco Polo's house.
Yeah, the old trick of saying
this is Marco Polo's house.
- This is so down.
- Joâo, look at the architecture.
How long are we gonna
look at all the architecture?
Seven hours and 46 minutes?
Very, very slow.
Why are you in a hurry? Can't
we pretend it's romantic?
We're in Venice.
Romance has nothing
to do with speed.
If poets wrote at this speed,
they'd never screw anyone.
Let me talk
to this big fruit behind us.
My fruity friend.
- Let's speed it up, okay?
- But, sir, this is a gondola.
- I want velocitá, velocitá!
- Stop screaming, Joâo.
Velocitá.
What is this shit?
Take him to the police car.
- We're late.
- We're in first class.
- We can come in whenever we want.
- We have to come in early.
First class, bambina. We can arrive
when we feel like it. Relax.
CLOSED
I remember who
you remind me of.
That actress from
"Breakfast at Tiffany's."
- Katherine Hepburn.
- Audrey.
She's the one. She did
that movie, "Sabrina",
- with Holden Caufield.
- William Holden.
I kind of like it. But tell me.
Are you pretty
or are you smart? Because
I'm kind of confused.
I don't know how
to deal with this.
Hey, just break
what's necessary.
I've decided
you're just pretty.
Hey, baby.
Excuse me.
The party's over.
Everybody out.
Let's go, honey.
Let's, go, let's go.
Get up, get up,
the party's over.
Do I have to throw you out?
It's my house.
Last call.
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's go.
Everyone in a single line
to the door.
Thanks. Fuck off.
Thanks.
That includes you, babe.
Get out. Out.
- What's so funny?
- She's the guy's cousin.
- Really?
- The guy's cousin.
I invited her. It's a bummer
you doing this.
It's a downer, you doing this.
Shut up.
You're a downer.
Joâo!
Sorry, Paulinho.
Come back another day.
Don't apologize.
I'm tired, Joâo.
Tired of this mess.
You know what this is?
A show of jealousy
and territorialism.
I'm sick of
this mad dash life.
This apartment's been
a club for three months.
Every night, these people
coming here
for free to get high in my house.
You're too old for this kind
of life. I can't take it.
Wait.
Hey, Josias.
- Here.
- How are you?
Hey, bum, still conning
those losers?
Teaching violin on the roof.
- I have to make a living.
- You got your passport?
- Europe again?
- Yeah.
- It's all the same?
- The same.
- I'm not going with the dogs.
- That's your place.
Your number changed?
I've got some
more lasagnas on me.
Look, we have to increase.
- Now we take six kilos.
- Fuck, six kilos, Joâo.
- That's what I said.
- It's got to be an overcoat.
I'm thinking of wearing armor.
You take it easy,
we'll be back to the Old Worid.
- Freeze.
- Don't move.
Freeze. Don't move.
Hands on your head.
- Hello.
- Hello, Laurita.
- Hi, Joâo.
- How are you?
I don't know. I don't know, Joâo.
I'm kind of spooked.
I should only stay
until tomorrow.
I'll be there.
We can talk then.
Do me a favor.
Bring me a sandwich.
I haven't eaten
in like 200 hours.
Police.
Hands on your head.
Fuck, Joâo, I didn't sleep
all night.
Let me tell you something.
That's a job for the Chinese.
- I should sue you.
- I should give you a cold bath.
You look like a lizard
hanging on to that sofa.
I'd have to go next door.
Nothing here is working.
I brought you a sandwich.
- A tuna sandwich.
- Tuna, Joâo?
You said you liked tuna.
I was real nice.
- I also brought guava juice.
- Guava?
Now you're getting on
my case because of the juice?
You could bore a businessman.
Take that coat and fix it up.
I called a tailor here
to do some alterations.
This I'm going to keep
for some fun later on.
This is my stash.
The Joâo Estrella stash.
Hey, Laurinha,
when this job is done,
I'll give you the money, okay?
Police.
The party's over.
Freeze.
- Police. Police.
- Quiet.
Police. The party's over.
Sit down, princess.
- Keep quiet.
- Put your arm here.
Stop that motherfucker.
Stop, stop.
Stop, man. Stop, fuck it.
Stop, you son of a bitch.
You want to die?
- Turn, turn.
- I've turned.
Get up.
You have to get me out of this.
I can't go to jail.
I have a daughter.
I'm just working, Joâo.
Dammit, Joâo.
Shut up, girl!
Hey, big shot,
keep your people quiet.
This is great. Forgive me, I'm very
nervous. I have to light up.
You can be arrested for that.
Then arrest me.
The artist here goes with me.
The rest go in the other car.
Let's go.
Let me go, let me go.
Help, help.
Get me out of here.
Let me go, fuck.
Arrested one of the
greatest drug rings
that distributed drugs
in bars and clubs in Rio.
Apartments were used
to distribute the drugs.
The Federal Police arrested
four suspects at an apartment
and found a new route in the
international drug trade.
The drugs came from Bolivia...
Look.
We've been at this interrogation
for over an hour. I'm hungry.
There's a barbecue here today
to celebrate your arrest.
So I just want to know this.
Are you going to admit
you're involved with drugs or no?
Are you interested
in buying some?
What's that for?
I'm in a good mood today.
And so are you.
Mr. Joâo Guilherme Estrella.
We've been after you
for six months.
We know more about
your life than you do.
What's so interesting
about it?
The guy's lawyer is here.
Your lawyer is here.
Renato Figueiredo.
Are you okay?
Did they interrogate you?
Sort of.
Well, your situation
is extremely serious.
My first advice to you
is to keep quiet.
You have that right,
understand?
You have to keep cool
and trust me.
Can you do that?
When can you get me
out of here?
We'll talk again in a few days.
That's your bed,
next to the bathroom.
Give me some smokes.
- Hey, man, get us some smokes.
- Make the brothers stronger.
C'mon, white filters
are cigarettes for manicures.
Thanks, Johnny.
I've been told some shithead
in here has been telling tales.
I see, there's a snitch inside.
Is anyone suspicious
of anyone else?
They think it's the Japanese guy?
Joâo Estrella.
Joâo Estrella.
Your lawyer sent this.
Thanks.
You know if some girl called me?
I don't know.
Hey, do you have
conjugal visits here?
- Not officially. They're forbidden.
- And unofficially?
Your hearing was
scheduled for next week.
It's a preliminary phase.
But it's very important.
I don't want to scare you. But
I don't want you to be nervous.
But this judge,
she's considered a hard ass.
Mr. Joâo Guilherme Estrella,
are you aware of the accusations
made against you?
Yes, ma'am.
Had you been involved
with the police previously?
When I was a teenager,
I used to smoke...
- Smoke what?
- A joint. A few.
I can see you've been traveling
through Europe.
What was the purpose
of your trip?
A honeymoon.
The records says you were arrested
with 6 kg of cocaine.
- Is that correct?
- No, that's not correct.
Can you tell me how it differs from
reality from your point of view?
It was 5.7 kg.
And I wasn't carrying.
Then who was carrying it?
Someone seriously addicted.
You say you were at 11 a.m.
At an apartment in Copacabana
with 5.7 kg of cocaine
whose origin you ignore.
Precisely. I don't know
where it came from.
What were you doing
at the apartment
- when the police arrived?
- Your honor, I was arrested
as soon as I came from the street.
The only things on me
were sandwiches and guava juice.
So who would plant
almost 6 kg of cocaine
in that Copacabana apartment?
I don't know. Maybe the person
who should be in my place.
The prosecution
has any questions?
I'd like to make a question.
Proceed.
Since the records mention
that the defendant
has a car, a permanent residence
and has traveled to Europe,
I'd like to know
if the defendant works.
If he has a source of income.
A steady job. Pays taxes.
Do you have a job?
Everybody chilling.
Everyone, pay attention.
Joâo Estrella.
News for you.
400 bucks.
In the guards quarters.
Beer, sandwich
and a clean sheet.
The whisky is charged extra,
and it's Brazilian. Okay?
Where do I sign up?
- Can I?
- Go, go.
Do it, do it.
Man, stop that. This is gonna
cause us trouble.
Come on, do something.
They're gonna kill him.
Stop, stop.
Disperse, disperse, you hear?
Nobody saw anything.
Hey, playboy,
this is a jail.
It's not a playground.
Get a grip.
This shit is serious here.
You, hear? Get a grip.
Let's go. Let's go, Claison.
Let's go.
Barcelona. Who knew?
We wound up in Irajá.
I wish I looked a little better.
You look great.
I've seen you much worse.
Hi there, legs.
Long time no see.
Wait, Joâo, we have to talk.
What about?
Who's the guy?
- Stop that.
- Who's the loser?
Joâo, you're being childish.
If you really love me,
you want to see me happy.
I came to talk to you,
because I didn't want to
end it like this.
We could still be friends.
Bye, Sofia.
I'm sorry.
What's with the meeting?
You're gonna have to tell us
what you were doing outside till
two in the morning with the Feds.
And it better be good. Because it
sounds like you're snitching on us.
That's fucked up. I'm stuck here
in this fucking hot hellhole
precisely because I didn't
rat out some fucker in here
and neither those
who turned me in.
And what were you doing
with the screws?
Playing cards?
Smoking a joint?
I was seeing my wife
or ex-wife or whatever.
I paid for a visit
and didn't get any.
That girl is stupid, man.
And I opened a gap
that you can use.
- You got it?
- I got it, man.
Now go and enjoy it. You go,
because I'm going to sleep.
Hey, big boy,
we're on to you, you hear?
The guy just opened up
a new avenue for us.
Come on, dude.
Take it easy on the playboy.
What's the news?
I'm telling you, transfer.
- You're gonna be transferred.
- No bullshit.
There's this big shot
from the command
and the pigs don't want two leaders
in the same prison.
Let's go, let's go.
There's some weed to pick up.
Fuck, this place is too crowded.
I can't sleep here. A fly would
have to go on a diet to sleep here.
I should have let
the guys kill me.
At least, I'd be in the morgue,
sleeping in a drawer, real cool.
- You snorted 50 grams.
- I have to snort more than that
to sleep in this place. I have to
hang like a bat from this ceiling.
Come on, man.
Give me a break.
- Get a place to sleep.
- There's a cell full of Africans.
- You want to go there?
- No fucking way.
I'd rather sleep standing. And it's
fucking hot in this place.
Don't you have any water, dude?
A soft drink?
Get us some water, man.
This is like the Sahara.
- I'm no Bedouin.
- Chill. You sound like Mick Jagger.
What? The guy
with the big mouth?
Are you laughing at me?
When's the breakfast?
What breakfast, man?
You just snorted 50 grams.
- What you need food for?
- Hey, brother.
- Big guy.
- Go get some food for us.
A Big Mac, a Quarter Pounder,
some nuggets, whatever.
You think this is a resort?
I'll pay for it.
I want my Big Mac
with a big Coke, so...
Stuff that Coke
where the sun don't shine.
Go to bed.
Fuck you.
A new hearing was scheduled
and we have to counter
the prosecution's strategy
of an Article 14.
- What's that?
- Conspiracy to distribute drugs.
The Feds will present this
as evidence.
It's a picture of your shoe
with 10 grams of cocaine.
You can say the 10 grams
were for your own use.
And you never saw
those people before.
Or you can admit
the 6 kg were yours.
You have a week
to decide...
- Take it easy. Come on.
- Get in and be quiet.
You treat me right.
You know who you're talking to?
Get away from me.
Why aren't you in jail
with us, you shit?
Because I have
a college degree.
I'm not staying in the sty
like you, asshole.
You got a degree as a snitch.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Son of a bitch.
- Go screw yourself.
- You fucked me.
You thought you had it made.
But you got fucked.
You're gonna get fucked.
You think they won't
fuck you, too?
Quantity, Joâo. Quantity.
You got screwed.
Go fuck yourself, asshole.
What's with you, man?
Stop that.
You thought you had it made.
Go to hell, bro.
Shut up, dude.
Son of a bitch.
- Go to hell.
- Motherfucker.
Stop that noise.
I'm gonna smack you all.
I'm gonna shoot you.
You calm down, assholes.
Mr. Danilo Rebelo. If the man
who sold you the cocaine
is present, please
point him out.
It was him.
Joâo Guilherme.
Please bring the defendant
Laura Regina Teixeira, please.
Are you feeling threatened?
No, ma'am, I'm feeling better.
Did you already know
the defendant? Joâo Estrella?
I did, but at the time,
I was lost.
Define "lost".
I didn't know
the word of the Lord.
I hadn't yet found
the path to Jesus.
If you'll allow me, your honor,
I'd like to quote
from the Old Testament.
Proverbs, 6, which says,
"My son, if you have become
surety for your neighbor..."
Excuse me. Please sit down.
This is a court room.
Please limit your answers
to the questions made.
Yes, ma'am.
You participated in packing
the cocaine in the apartment?
No, no, ma'am.
I went there to pick up
a coat I forgot there.
A coat? In the middle of summer?
It was a light coat.
Six kilos. Do you know how the
drugs arrived at the apartment?
No, I don't.
You want to make me believe
nobody owned the cocaine?
I really don't know.
So I should conclude
that 6 kg of cocaine
on the 9th floor,
flew in through the window?
Sorry to interrupt, your honor.
But you didn't ask me that.
You'll speak when spoken to.
The cocaine
was mine, your honor.
I got in my car and took
the drugs there personally.
Ms. Laura and Mr. Sergio
are not involved in this.
I did it all alone.
I wanted to make that clear.
I did it all alone.
I opened the newspaper,
there was my picture.
They wrote,
"Johnny behind bars."
My name isn't Johnny.
My name is Joâo.
I'm no criminal.
I'm no Pablo Escobar.
I don't have a gang.
I don't have a fortress.
I don't have a big operation.
I don't have money in Switzerland.
I don't have any of that.
I used drugs and sold them.
I would use and sell.
If I were that powerful,
my family wouldn't sell
our only property
to pay for my defense.
I didn't want my mom
to hear this.
I've used drugs
since I was a kid.
And before I was busted,
I was snorting a lot. Snorting with
my friends. Snorting...
more than 100 grams a week.
Sorry, Mom.
I just wanted to say
what I'm feeling now.
Everyone has a dream.
I also have my dreams.
But to make your dreams come true,
you didn't have to become
involved in a criminal activity.
I didn't sell drugs
to make money.
I sold drugs to spend money
to buy more cocaine,
to use more drugs.
You are speaking of felonies.
I never knew what's
against the law or not.
My life...
Things just happened.
Hey, bro, let's go
to the Africans' cell
to settle something.
You're our translator.
- Translator? What happened?
- Those guys are pigs.
They throw food in the hall.
It's gets fucking nasty.
And there was this motherfucker
who snitched about
the McDonald's thing.
We're gonna
set them straight.
Man, those guys are huge.
They're gonna kick our ass.
Are you chicken?
Don't chicken out, man.
Look, I don't give a shit.
They're big, but we're mean.
And if we don't like
what goes down,
things are gonna get real ugly.
Let's go, guys.
Let's go, dude.
Come on.
Hey, you monkeys,
come on over.
I talk and you translate.
You are fucking pigs.
From now on you have
to clean this pig sty.
And the snitch
is gonna get a beating.
What that bastard say?
"Blue ass."
Cleanliness.
They're gonna talk
among themselves.
They're gonna talk and
see what they can do.
No way, man.
You tell them
to clean this shit up today.
Or things are gonna get ugly.
Come on, Joâo,
you don't speak English.
Fuck, you're bullshiting me. These
guys are talking without subtitles.
I've seen this shit
in an American movie.
This guy is telling me
to fuck myself.
You fuck yourself. Fuck you,
fuck me. Fuck everyone.
Go fuck yourself.
Good news, Joâo.
The report from forensics
confirmed the report
of the specialist we hired
that you have diminished
capacity and aren't totally
responsible for your actions.
If the judge
accepts the reports,
you may get a reduced sentence.
As the evidence in this
report will show,
this is a white shark of drugs.
A dangerous predator
of the Rio streets.
I would like to remind
you honor
that there's no proof
of any gang affiliation.
Six kilos just to Europe.
He's not a delinquent, a user.
He's a major dealer.
Let's hear the report
of the federal agent
tailing Joâo Guilherme. "The target
left his residence
and walked to a public phone.
Then he got into his car. "
In bad condition, by the way.
"After several attempts,
the car would not start."
Your honor,
this major dealer
has to walk.
If we depended
on Joâo Guilherme,
organized crime would be
very disorganized.
This young man needs proper
treatment at a good facility.
I agree. A proper facility.
Jail. And for a good while.
Analyzing the evidence,
I have no doubt
the sentence for this youth
and his friends should be long.
But law in not an exact science.
Like an equation derived
from the penal code.
Proof + arrest + mitigation.
And then you have a sentence.
I find the defendant,
Joâo Guilherme Estrella, guilty
of the crimes of distribution and
international drug trafficking.
I reject the count of conspiracy,
for I agree with the defense
that there is no evidence
of any criminal organization.
It's hard to imagine
a group of addicts
achieving in crime the stability
they didn't find in life.
I hereby determine he should
be released from prison
and transferred to
a mental health facility
for a minimum of two years.
- You got in, friend.
- I'm looking for a bed.
It's crowded here.
Better find a hole there.
Just to be sure.
You're a rookie, huh?
Hold this, big boy.
I yank this from the roof
and hide it all over.
You're gonna need it
one day.
Thanks, I just wanted a bed.
It must be that one.
That's the bed?
Be grateful they put down
some newspaper.
Usually, they don't
put anything down.
We're all crazies here.
Some are crazier than others
like that guy.
What did he do?
He managed a drug house
in the slum.
He's here because of what
he did to his enemies.
He chopped off legs, arms.
The bastards were still alive.
"Mad Max", the movie, remember?
With Mel Gibson?
Sometimes he has a crisis
and throws a fit.
I can't concentrate
on a book like you do.
You have to find a book
that's got your head's rhythm.
- What are you doing?
- Fishing rats.
- Fishing what?
- Rats.
There's a school there.
- Have you caught any?
- No.
Here, I brought one for you.
Thanks.
What's going on?
The thing is Jane...
The one with big boobs or
the one from the limousine?
She has the boobs.
They're not huge,
but they're big enough.
She's catching
the plane to Boston.
She's meeting her tennis teacher at
the Tower of Pisa. I love Germany.
The Tower of Pisa in Germany?
You had your meds today?
- Lower that thing.
- I've never been on a plane.
- Lower that thing.
- Don't do it. Don't.
Louder, louder, Joâo.
Careful, Joâo. Joâo!
Help!
You're going to die, bastard.
What's going on here?
Take the nut job away.
The guy broke my TV.
Hey, I'm innocent.
This was under my bed.
Give me my meds.
Give me my meds.
Wise up, you're the new guy.
The nuts here
are real heavy duty.
They've killed
mothers, sons, wives.
Keep your eyes open.
Or you'll never leave here.
Party's over, everyone to bed.
Get moving. Let's go.
Moacyr, come
lock everyone in.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine, mom.
- Sorry.
I brought you...
If you need some.
- Do you need it?
- No, Mom, I'm fine. It's all fine.
- I'm fine.
- It'll go by quickly.
Yeah...
Let's go.
Hey, Mr. Zé.
- Hey there.
- How are you?
- You saw the game?
- Yeah, I did.
- You're not bad.
- Almost a superstar.
I wanted to come
bring the news myself.
The judge granted you
Christmas leave.
In two weeks, I can
put my feet out of this place.
Feet, nose,
head, members.
Especially the members.
Hey, Joâo, want some?
Our true birthplace is that
where we first lay
an intelligent gaze
upon ourselves.
