A FILM B Y JEAN-LUC GODARD
SLOW MOTION
'Morning, sir. May I remove the tray?
Denise Rimbaud, please
Is Denise there?
Can you get me Studio 3 -
that's the video studio?
Yes, it's Paul. I'll be there in an hour
- Signor Godard...
- Come on, get the suitcases
- Stop pestering me!
- The suitcases...
- The cases...
- I've had enough of you!
M. Godard, did you tell the manager
about... you know...
You're a wonderful man
I was drunk
It's all right
M. Godard...
I'd like to tell you something
- What?
- I love you, sir
- You mean my soul?
- No, your body
- What?
- Your body, sir
- I'd like you to bugger me
- What?
Bugger me. I've been buggered
by half the navy
Nothing better than
a nice little arsehole
You kissed me, you bastard!
I love you
This is the Devil's city!
1: SLOW MOTION
0: RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
What's that music I hear?
- What music?
- That music, you can hear it
I don't know what music you mean
They had a daughter who
married a schoolteacher
And their third son, who was called
André, was a bit simple
Yes, I remember
Then he had a car crash when he was with
Taugu's wife - that was quite a scandal
Yes, he married one of the Bioux cousins
An odd girl
His parents were against it
Then he left. Do you know
what's become of him?
No, I heard nothing more
I wonder what's become of him
Didn't he go off to Risoux?
As far as I know, he's still in France
- He is
- Thanks
Have you seen M. Piaget this morning?
Yes, he dropped by
I was supposed to meet him here
I think he went to take some photos
Photos?
Yes, of the football match
Is it far?
Not very. Over there,
behind the station
Funny seeing you here, Denise
1: THE IMAGINARY
It's been ages
Not that long, Michel. Not really
Is your project a novel?
Not exactly
But it could be
Sort of...
I'm only asking because of
what you said in your letter
You're working on a new serial -
about how things really are
Not just an imitation
That's what I always wanted for my paper
It wouldn't go down well around here
Your hair is still lovely, like ebony
You mock the heritage system, yet
now you act just like your father
That's true
At first it felt very odd,
taking over his business
It was awful
That's what the revolution is about
It's all right now
At least I have the countryside
The landscape...
Serene as a still-life
- You're going back?
- I must find a place to stay, first
But I'll be back here on Monday
- Definitely
- Fine
Call at the shop later,
when I've spoken to Madeleine
So that's the silo of grain for the cattle.
They're fed every morning
I just get the grain
And the rest is automatic
- And it goes straight into the barn?
- Yes
You start it off with the green,
then stop it with the red
- Can I make a phone call from here?
- Go ahead
Let me show you something
It's nice when they give you a good lick
It's Denise
Listen...
Just listen, you sod
You'll have to get Duras for me
I'll give you the address
Because I'll be late, that's why
Paul, listen
I won't say it again
Yes, I took back your key...
Because I'm finished,
or rather I'm starting anew
I've put an ad in for the flat
Now you're telling me
What's your name?
I've put your case in your room.
First on the left, up the stairs
I've dragged it out for two years.
You should congratulate me
People always say... they say that...
They say you need someone to lean on.
I wanted someone to lean with. See?
We've never been together,
never leaned on each other
We never leaned together
Something seemed to stop us
It's not a tragedy
Well, yes, I talk like you now
All right, then. So what's the address?
That doesn't mean we should stop
Not knowing someone
makes it more interesting
Even passionate
No, that's not passion
All right, I'll go... I said I'll go
And about the flat, I promise I'll do it
Only not now, because of
Cécile and my ex-wife
I knew you'd say that
Oh, damn it. Talk it over with Yvette
Yvette...
It's Denise
It's always the last time until the next
All right, we'll see. 'Bye for now
Something in the body
and in the mind...
...arches its back against
routine and void
Life...
A quicker gesture
An arm
An arm moving up and down -
off beat
A slower step forward
A gust of air
A startled gasp
A wrong move
All these lame. Last-ditch attempts...
...to fill the void of a regular job
- But things still happen...
- All right, we'll replace it
- Minute as they are
- But I want to know where I am
- And time still exists...
- Maurice's leaving. You take his place
...oddly stretched out
This awkwardness
- This aimless movement
- Then you'll learn to use the printer
- When does the paper come out?
- This sudden acceleration
This hesitation of the hand
- Every Thursday
- This grimace
This discord...
...is life's struggle to hang on
That thing which in each man
silently screams:
''I am not a machine! ''
Why is he leaving?
It's a long story
You'd better ask him
They didn't get on
- Is that Madeleine?
- Yes
Why did you keep this photo of me?
- It doesn't look like me any more
- Call it madness
Come here
What I meant before by a novel is what
made me so passionate about your letter
That's not passion
By describing the secondary events
you shed light on the main issues
The secondary role is the main one
How much will I get?
300 to start with
If it works out, we'll talk again
- What about Paul?
- It's over
But no one seems to notice
Not even me
Choose!
- Choose
- No, I won't
- Choose!
- No
- Georgiana...
- You have to choose
You choose, Georgiana
I won't choose
I won't choose
I won't choose
I won't choose
About twenty seconds
- Is Cécile there?
- Yes, over there
Stop spitting on your hands!
2. FEAR
- You make them sweat here
- Yes, a little
Marie-Claude, hit a bit harder!
- Heard the latest about Castro?
- No
He claims the Americans work
better than his own Cubans
Oh, well...
Truth will out, you know
- Do you have children?
- Yes, a daughter
How old?
- Twelve, like Cécile
- No, Cécile is eleven
- Has she already got tits?
- Yes, like Cécile
Don't you ever feel like touching her up,
or buggering her?
No
I think it's unfair that a mother can
touch her children, boy or girl...
...more easily than the father
Come on, hurry up
Why didn't Mummy come to fetch me?
The bitch wouldn't give me the Peugeot
And I have to take this one
to the garage. Come on then
And I must see someone at the TV studios
Where's my present?
MARGUERITE DURAS Look.
See the end of the world. She says
She says: See the end of the world
All the time
Every second
Everywhere
It's spreading far beyond
That's better. She says
It's so difficult
So terribly hard
Terribly...
We have to go, Jeanine
All right, let's stop
- No problem
- That's better
- Do thank Denise for me
- I will, 'bye
Since M. Godard happens to be here
with us, it would be nice if...
- Would you say a few words?
- No, thanks
And I know Duras won't come up
- You mean Duras is here? Where?
- Next door. I came to get her
Call her then!
Marguerite!
Well, let's see now
Is she there?
Yes, there she is
She's immobile
Didn't Denise warn you this might happen?
No, she didn't
Well then, I will say a few words
Let me see your notes, please
Thanks
Well, here goes
''I make films to keep myself busy
''lf I had the strength, I'd do nothing
''It's because I can't bear doing nothing
that I make films
''For no other reason
''That's the most honest thing
I can say about my work''
That goes for me too
As for Duras...
Whenever you see a passing lorry...
...think of it as the passing word
of a woman
But couldn't she just come up here
to say that she won't come?
Writing is almost like disappearing
It's being behind something
But certain physical signs
made me aware...
...that there was something
dubious about it
Something almost immoral
I felt physically sick.
Speaking about it afterwards
The silence surrounding a text -
the reading of a text. That is...
It's the spoken word which creates it
If women have their place - and
I'm not sure such a place exists...
I think a woman's place
is full of childhood
At least. More so than a man's place
Men are more childish than women
but they have less childhood
- You'll help me?
- I will
Will you love me for long?
Longer than you think
- Where is Duras then?
- She isn't here
Where is she?
Where is she?
I took her straight to the airport.
She left at five o'clock
I don't believe it!
She wanted to leave earlier.
Isn't that right, Cécile?
I don't know
But what shall I tell
the programme controller?
The truth
- What truth?
- That you're leaving
Whose show is it? Mine or yours?
Answer, you son of a bitch!
- Listen, Denise
- Will you answer, damn you?
- Hey, gently
- No, never gently. Never again
- Will you answer?
- Yes. It's your show
- So who are you to decide for me?
- I don't know
Answer me! Go on, answer!
But it didn't change a thing. You can do
whatever you decide, whatever I say
Don't you tell me it doesn't change
a thing. I can think for myself!
Why do you always have to think for me?
If I leave TV, it'll be my doing!
And you won't take its place! I'm not
your audience, like your stupid daughter
And now I'm stuck with the early
billing. All because of you!
- Because of your idiot father
- Oh, go to hell!
Longer than you think!
''During the last 200 years, blackbirds
left the forests and became city birds
''First in England in the 18th century...
''Then in Paris and in the Ruhr
''During the 19th century, they invaded
all the cities in Europe
''They settled in Vienna and Prague
around 1900
''Then they went east, taking over
Budapest, Belgrade and Istanbul''
- What did they do then?
- That's another paragraph
Let me see
''For the planet Earth...
''... the blackbird's invasion of man's
world is far more significant...
''... than the conquest of South America
or the return of the Jews to Palestine
''The modification of relations between
species, fish, birds, men, plants...
''... is a modification of a higher order...
''... than the changes in relations
between groups of the same species
''Bohemia may have been occupied
by the Celts and the Slavs...
''... and Bessarabia conquered
by the Russians or the Rumanians
''The earth couldn't care less
''But a blackbird betraying nature
to follow man in his artificial universe...
''... that's what changes
the organization of the planet''
I'm supposed to draw a conclusion
- After ''planet''?
- Yes
- Do you have an idea?
- No
- How about you, Paulette?
- No
I don't feel like having ideas nowadays
Everyone's scared of thinking
''The last two centuries of history...
''... as the blackbird invasion
of man's cities... ''
I've got to make a call
We don't have much to say to
each other even once a month
That's true
Can I have my cheque, please?
Here
And my present?
You too?
How old are you, Cécile?
- Answer me when I ask you
- You're a bloody bore, Daddy
Why won't the little bitch answer?
- What's wrong with you, Paul?
- Nothing
I know what it is
All I did was to ask how old she was
He wants to get his own back
because his girl-friend clouted him
Denise again
That's still going on? I thought it had
been over since the summer
Still staying in your plush hotel?
I'm undecided. I want to leave
But I think she only wants me
to keep the flat for her...
...in case she decides to come back
Where's she going?
I don't know
Further and further away
At least she's got the guts to walk out
- She's still searching
- So am I
Not really
Not really, Paul
Let me tell you: She'll leave alone
and sad, just as I did
Because I didn't really want to leave
What about the present?
Here
Take yours off and put this on
You're a shit, Paul
Why? Because I want to see her tits?
You're either a bastard or sexually bent!
Not bent - finished
Ask Cécile what ''finished'' means.
She's good at maths
'Bye for now - until next month
Thanks for waiting
I'll have a sandwich, please
I can't drive you home. No car
Don't worry about me
Have you really put an ad in for the flat?
That's bloody unfair
Give me time, won't you?
I'm also getting sick of living in the city
I used to believe you but not any more
I get fed up even with a small town
like Nyons
I wanted you to take the flat
You said you needed peace and quiet -
you had new projects
- I still have. Nothing's changed
- No...
Only if I stayed as well
You want a guardian angel
And I've had enough of being one
Neither angel nor beast,
nor god nor master
Buying a bike and going to the mountains
won't change your life
It's none of your business now
Yes, but I have eyes
and I see what's what
You wanted to combine love
with work...
...with a shared activity,
not only at night
Nights should grow out of days,
you said
It's not me. It's how people are
We both agreed that love couldn't
survive without a bit of work
Just bursts of passion,
nothing that lasts
It's too hard when it lasts
I want to do things, not define them -
I leave the definitions to you
I learned to feed animals today
There was a calf with a hole in its back.
Whatever he ate poured out of it
With me, it's people
What do you mean?
They have a hole in the mouth
and the words just pour out
Where were you phoning from?
From my mother's
I told you I had to take Cécile out.
It's her birthday
What did you give her?
Nothing - I'm paying for
her football training
She's like you. She says she wants
to play football, but it's just talk
What does it have to do with me?
You and your bike
You think it's action,
but it's only talk, in fact
- May I read?
- ''What's going to happen to me?
- ''Will I go to Heaven? ''
- Words express anxiety kept by memory
''Please tell me, Father''
''I like you, my son'', says the priest.
''But I can't tell you just like that
''Come back on Saturday''
The bloke can hardly wait. Come Saturday,
he rushes back: ''Well, Father? ''
The priest says: ''I have
two pieces of news for you
''One good and one bad
''The good one is that it's all fixed up
about Heaven. You'll get there''
The man's delighted.
''But what about the bad news? ''
''The bad news is that you're
going there on Wednesday''
It happens, you know
What's that music?
- I'm going
- I'm coming with you
No. Ring me on Saturday
- I'm coming with you
- No!
I've had enough - oh, shit!
- Feel like a film?
- Sound!
There's no sound - no sound!
It's outrageous!
They've cut out the sound.
It's ridiculous!
Did you hear me, Miss?
There's no sound!
- Where's the projectionist?
- There isn't one
- You're joking!
- There hasn't been one for years!
What do you mean? What do you
take me for? That's not funny
This is outrageous!
Want to see a film?
Not really
Are we going to see a film or not?
All right
I took off my pants so you can
touch me in the dark
- Will there be a newsreel?
- Probably
Then leave your pants on
- What's wrong?
- I just feel like watching a film
There are hundreds of men walking down
the street who'd love to screw me!
Go ahead, then
I'm going home
You make me sick
I'm trying to create a meaningful
relationship between us, don't you see?
You can't create something with a hammer
So, are we going to see a film or not?
All right
Don't work so hard - don't pretend
She had shut her eyes. It was going
to be a long one. But never mind
She could use the time
to organize her day
First she'll tidy up her room - impeccably
Bed-linen. Papers - even the mirrors
and the silver
Then she'll replace the curtain cords.
Clean the windows too
Then all the rest - so the commune will
see that they were dependent on her
She must call the plumber
He must come today. Or nobody
will know what to do
3. TRADE
And one might risk a painful death
Is that all right?
That's fine
Did you sleep well?
Not really, too many dreams
Oh well, dreams are always terrible
Even in a dream, one keeps
looking for solutions
- See you some day
- 'Bye
Bitch
Scum! Trade-unionist!
You think you can be independent?
Yes
No one is independent
- Repeat after me!
- No one's independent
Not the whore, nor the typist
- Repeat!
- Not the whore nor the typist
Not the housewife nor the duchess
nor the servant
Not the servant, nor the housewife
Not the tennis champion
Not the schoolgirl
Not the schoolgirl
Not the farmer
- Not the farmer
- That's enough
Only the banks are independent
But banks are killers
Come on then
Don't be scared
This is only a first warning
We're not killers
We don't want all your money. Only half
Got it?
Understood?
She didn't see me. Is she coming up?
Yes, don't worry
Are you a friend of Isabelle?
I don't think Isabelle has friends
What do you do?
I'm a journalist and an illustrator.
I'm working on a comic strip
What the hell are you doing here?
Héléne! It's not my turn to wash up
Yes, all right
So why did you come?
I wanted to ask you something
I must make a phone call first
She's such a pain, your sister
That's what I'm working on right now
Stücky Agency?
I'm calling about the ad
for the four-roomed flat
Oh well...
Well, too bad. Thanks anyway. Goodbye
What's that music?
All right, so what do you want?
I need some money
How much?
I don't know... twenty or thirty thousand
What for? Are you mad?
We built a boat, me and some friends
We wanted to sail to the Antilles
But we didn't have enough money
We still need sails
So we tried to rob a jeweller's shop
but it was a total flop
They're all in jail. I have to help them
Is it still Jacques?
No, it's some others you don't know
Thirty thousand francs?
Twenty thousand would be all right
I haven't got it
Anyway, I'm leaving. It's too tough here
Where are you going?
The country...
I don't know yet
Anyway, I don't have it.
Give me a cigarette
I'm not asking you for it
What then?
I don't get it
I wanted to ask you about
going on the game like you...
Just for a week or two
That's all
Two times seven, times four,
divided by two...
Two weeks won't be enough
You'd need a month, not a week or two
If need be
But do you realise what you'll have to do?
Yes
- How big are your tits?
- So-so
Show me
Do you have a thick bush?
So-so
You know what you'll have to do?
Suck cocks
Done it before?
With Jacques, but not really
Do you have to swallow the sperm
or just pretend?
Better to swallow it
How does it taste?
Here, see for yourself
Have you ever licked a bloke's arse?
No
Well, you may have to
But don't say yes to everything
What they want is to humiliate you
You said divided by two. Why?
Half for me
- I see
- Yes
It's a deal
Let's talk in my room.
I have to make a phone call
Why don't you like my sister?
And you? Are you happy?
No, I have problems
But nothing really serious
Nothing you could write a novel about
I heard some chap say that happiness
can't make a subject for a novel
Well, then I'm happy
And how are Mum and Dad?
They've moved again.
They're back in Grenoble
Back in Grenoble?
They've got guts, those two
Can't you wait till I've gone to do that?
No, not at that price
You shouldn't have sold
Rocheteau and Barberis
No, I'm not worried
The Ajax chaps will be here soon.
They're ready to sign
I don't know... 45 minutes
Well, find a way
- Claudia sent me
- Right, put your things over there
- You know the price?
- It's fine with me
Is that all right?
- Yes, thanks
- Thank you, sir
- Will you excuse me?
- Go ahead
Hello? Yes, it's M. Person speaking
Take off your shoes
Just a minute
Come here
Take off your trousers
No, my wife was just asking me something
Well, yes, women!
No, I said 160
That's right, 160
What? 130? Definitely not
Come closer
- Lean against the window
- Yes
- Yes, sir
- Yes, sir
What? 120?
No, 145
We drove to the beach that day
Yes, sir
- A weekday. Wonderfully deserted
- No, 140
At the end of spring
The beachcombers were
asleep in their rags...
- On the grass. By the beach
- No, 138
Others were sitting on the stone benches.
Sharing a pathetic bottle
The gulls wheeled madly above.
Mindlessly
Old ladies of seventy or more
sat on the benches...
125?
...and spoke of selling the inheritance
left ages ago by their husbands...
- I have expenses too!
- And stupidly managed
No, I can't go any lower than 120,
believe me
In short. There was peace in the air
And we walked a bit.
Then lay on the grass in silence
It simply felt good. Being together
I bought sandwiches. Crisps
and some beer
And we ate on the sand
No, not 120. No, that's impossible
I have my overheads
You too? I don't doubt it
Then I held Cass and we slept
for an hour or so
It was even better than making love
Floating in sleep
without the tension of desire
We drove back and I cooked dinner
Then I asked Cass
if she'd like to live with me
She paused. Then looked at
me and said no
A hundred
That's how it goes
Well, think it over
Yes, ask for M. Person
20-15-51, room 510
Ye gods, she's showing her arse
to the whole town
- Enjoying the view?
- Shut up
Sorry, sir
That'll do, you can get dressed
- Your name is really M. Person?
- Yes, why?
I don't know. It's rather an unusual name
Isn't it normal for a person
to be called Person?
Look, I burned myself
P as in Person
Are you a passionate sports fan?
I wouldn't call that a passion
- What do I do now?
- Let me think
All right, let's see
You'll really do anything?
- Yes, as long as it doesn't hurt
- I'd never do that
- What's your name?
- Isabelle
Isabelle, go out into the corridor
Then come back in thirty seconds,
all right?
You're our daughter
You're back from England
We're in town. You come
and see us at the hotel
Then you say:
''Hello, Daddy''
Then kiss your Mummy
- Mummy?
- Yes, your Mummy
All right, get out of here! Hurry up!
Whatever you say
- Isabelle?
- Yes
Remember me?
- Not really
- Marie-Luce
Oh yes, hello
- We were at primary school together
- Yes, I remember
- What are you up to?
- I'm waiting for a friend
And what do you do?
- Not much
- No? But are you working?
Not much at present
- Listen, would you like a job?
- Yes
I might have something. I deal with
people who are looking for people
- I'm interested
- You are?
Thanks. Will you be free in
in fifteen minutes?
No, I'll be tied up for an hour or so
Well, in an hour then.
Number 15, Rue du Nord
All right?
- OK, then
- Number 15, North Road
- Thanks
- 'Bye
Oh look! It's Isabelle!
- What a surprise!
- Hello, Mummy
Hasn't she grown?
Look, she's got tits now
Show Mummy your tits
And what an arse she's got.
Show that too
Now you show your arse
to your daughter
It's bigger than yours
Now, Mummy, show your bush
to your daughter
There!
Look at our daughter's lovely bush
A pretty little red bush...
Like the colour of autumn
Go on, Isabelle, ask Mummy
to kiss your pussy
Mummy, kiss my pussy
Go on
Right, that'll do
Are you happy? Is that what you wanted?
No, I wanted something else
You always mess things up
- You're pathetic
- That's not true
This way
Here he is
Hello
- She tells me you like adventure
- Not terribly
- You'll have to travel
- Where?
Could we talk it over tonight?
I'm working tonight
You don't have to worry
Once a month you'll get a ticket by post.
You go and you come back
Where will I go?
It depends. Caracas, Beirut,
New York, Paris even
- And what do I do?
- Nothing. Just travel
Go to a hotel, stay a couple of days
and come back
I must do something
Your friend is thick. We've told you,
you do nothing
And you'll get 5,000 dollars when you leave
and 5,000 dollars when you get back
When would I start?
The 10th or 15th
- Hello, Claudia sent me
- Put your coat there
Sit down
Jerk me a little
What's she like?
She's nice
How's her arse?
- Do I undress?
- Just do as you're told
Take your trousers off
- I have to use the phone first
- Panties too
Don't move
Till tomorrow
- So what's her arse like?
- Nothing special
- Take your trousers off, too
- Yes, boss
Hello, I'd like to call Montreal,
Canada, please
Area code 74
879...
43-49...
Room 522, thank you
Ask her her name
What's your name?
Marilyn
Does she want a slap?
Nicole
- Nicole what?
- Weber
Your tits aren't so great
Say it
What?
Say that your tits aren't great
My tits aren't great
Louder
My tits aren't great
Good
Well, to work, MIle. Weber
Come here
Kneel down
Get to work
Get under the desk
What do I do?
Suck his cock. You have to
spell it out to them nowadays!
Get the other one
Yes, boss
You can do better, you fat slob
Lick my thighs
Gently
That's it
- Suck my balls
- Here. For example...
You can ask Louis who his heroes are
- Who are your heroes. Louis?
- My thighs again
Let's see... Al Capone.
Guevara. Malcolm X
- Gandhi. Robinson
- Keep going!
Mamma Barker. Castro
Van Gogh. Sartre. Bob Dylan
You see he identifies with all the losers
He's been conned
by all that spiritual bullshit
- That's how we screw them!
- Come here, you
It's all tricks. There are no heroes!
There are no winners. It's all bullshit.
No saints. No geniuses
Only dirty tricks and fairy-tales
make the game go
Closer, don't be frightened
- Was it you who wanted to use the phone?
- Yes
Go ahead
- Do you want to piss as well?
- Not right now
Go on, ring. Dial 0 first
- Stick it up her arse, Thierry!
- Which one, boss?
The one under the table
And you, each time he
shoves it in, you suck
All right? Nice and steady
I'm sorry to call so late.
I'm ringing about the ad
- Haven't you finished yet?
- About the flat...
Fine, till Saturday then. Goodbye
Everyone tries to hang on...
And to strike lucky.
All the rest is just shit
All right. I'm with you about the losers
But Castro looked extremely fat
in his last photo
What is it?
He survives because the US and Russia
keep him in the middle
But if he really stuck his foot in.
What could he do then?
He wouldn't have enough to pay
for a cheap whore in Cairo
''Go to hell. The two of you! ''
''I like whom I like''. Said Louis
All right
What do you want me to do?
- Do you have any lipstick?
- Yes
Thierry, go and get it
I've got it here
Now, you, Nicole...
Lie on your back
You, Thierry
Put your thing in her mouth
- What's your name?
- Isabelle
You come and stand here, Isabelle
That's fine. Stop
- Come closer
- Do I lick her arse?
- Did I tell you to?
- Sorry, boss
What were women in the Middle Ages?
I don't know
- And you?
- I don't know
And you?
And you?
Witches
And what else?
Snares of the devil, embers of hell
Where did the bitch get that from?
Where did you get it?
- I heard it on the radio
- Good
You put the lipstick on me
only when he licks your arse
And you, Thierry...
You lick her arse only when
the other one sucks you
And you...
You suck whenever I touch
your tits with my foot
Let's try it
The picture's all right,
now let's do the sound
When I touch your tits with my shoe...
You say ''Ouch'', then suck him
Go
You, Thierry...
When she sucks you say ''Ah''
Then lick her arse
Let's go
And you...
When he licks your arse,
you say ''Hey! ''
Like when you're goosed on the Métro
Go to it, Thierry
Then you put some lipstick on me...
Just once
And if I smile, then you kiss me
Let's go
I was looking at that ivory face
And I saw in it...
...an expression of sombre pride
Savage power
Abject terror
And despair as well
lmmense despair...
Incurable
- I'm going to the bakery
- All right
I'll see the flat and meet you in an hour
''A Hundred Do-It-Yourself Ideas''
I've an idea
- You've an idea?
- That's right
What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?
- I rang about the flat
Oh, yes
What's going on?
We can't seem able to touch
each other without bruising
You're crazy
She look like she's in pain!
She's got a hard head.
She's a banker's daughter
I'll leave you to it
4. MUSIC
I always feel too much
I've got to let it out somewhere
Me too
And the one who loves you gets it
Of course, he's right at hand
No thanks
Will you go on with the same work here?
For a while. I'll see.
I've been offered another job
''Don't forget that a carrot
trembles before the knife...
''... that lettuce screams when it's torn
and cabbage weeps when boiled''
Angelo Napoli, 15th October, 1979
What's that?
An ex-boy-friend of mine, an Italian.
He wrote it
Was it very painful leaving -
what's his name - Paul?
Yes
I wanted him to keep the flat on
Actually, no. It would have annoyed me
- He's still there
- No
Yes. I saw him yesterday
He said he'd wait there for two days,
until you came to talk to him
- He wanted you to tell me that
- Well, I did
Is that what your project is - a book?
No, but it might be part of it
''You always get somewhere.
I thought I'd never get to be 32''
- You're 32?
- Yes
And this?
''Crystal and smoke,
the two faces of death''
It's from an English novel. I can't
remember the title, but it impressed me
No regrets then, I keep everything?
Yes. Send me the phone bill
when it arrives
I'm really grateful. It's a great help
- It's a greater help to me
- No, me
- 'Bye then
- Goodbye
Are you happy?
Yes
You were very good
- Did you turn the radio on?
- Yes
It interests you?
Yes, I'm interested in physics
And in the physical too
- Would you mind if I turned it off?
- No
I wanted to say...
It's true
But it's not tragic
- Is that you in the photo over there?
- Yes
And the other?
It was here before,
but I kept it because I like cola
Let me speak to Yvette,
the video studio
I've been wandering about for two days
Yes, because of Denise
I'm a bit depressed
It's all right now
Did you finish it?
Put that here
What day is it?
Wednesday?
Will you be staying or going, M. Godard?
Well... can I stay another six months?
- That's absolutely fine
- Thank you
This is a brand-new car. What have
you done with the rear view mirror?
- Where are you going?
- Shopping for Cécile
Sorry about Thursday evening
Can't we see each other more often?
Once a week?
Well?
I'll think about it
'Bye then
- I think I know him!
- Forget it. We're getting out of here
Wait
Rather stupidly, I started thinking
I'm not dying
My life hasn't flashed before my eyes
I'm not dying...
Since I don't feel a thing
What are you looking at?
It's nothing to do with us
Let's go, Cécile
