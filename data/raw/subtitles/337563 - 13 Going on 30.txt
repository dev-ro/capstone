Ηe didn't have Battleship.
Ηe didn't have any games.
Boys are so stupid.
Becky' it's even worse
than you think.
Ηow come the ones

Love is a battlefield.

There's no easy way of saying this'
so l'm just gonna come oυt with it.
The circs are in.
Our numbers are dismal.
We're below 600,000 total circulation.
Sparkle is closing in on a million.
l've come off the phone with corporate,
and they have dropped the R word.
Redesign?
Redesign Poise?
Wait. Sparkle copies everything
we come υp With. . .
. ..and we have to redesign?
That's bullshit.
Well' either We redesign and bring up
oυr numbers, or they pυll the plug.
Richard, redesign is a death sentence.
Νo, it's not. lt's a chance
to have some fυn.
Let Sparkle have all our
secondhand, stale, grody ideas.
We'll open up the F .O .B . ,
overhaυl the B .O .B .
lt's time for us to prove
we have some poise left.
Well' l shall be leaving it
to my dynamic duo. . .
. ..to come υp with something
utterly fabuloυs.
We have two weeks,
foυr hours and 30 minutes.
-l have yoυr urgent messages.
-Let's hear them.
Well' okay.
Emily Pratt called
and wanted me to tell yoυ:
"l can't believe yoυ scooped my story
on Vivienne Tam' you backbiting bitch.
That was a new level
of sleaze, even for you.
l hope you die in one
of her casυal pantsuits."
Oh' my God' that was so mean.
Miss Lewis called. She said,
"l hope you choke on your own bile. . .
. ..yoυ pretentioυs, conniving snake."
-Maybe l shoυld read them myself.
-Good.
Oh' great.
-Miss Rink's line.
-Put that little bitch on the phone now .
Please don't take that tone.
l'm just her assistant.
Tell her to call Todd΄
"Sweet bottom, yoυ seem υptight.
Let me come over and give you my... ."
-Yes.
-Alex is on line one, Miss Rink.
Oh , gag me . Can you

What are you doing?
What's wrong, pooky?
"Pooky"?
Pukey. You're married,

So come on.

. ..with this crazy new act
she has going on.
Yoυ know how she stole
Charlotte's idea and then fired her?
l say we go ahead
with our own presentation. . .
. ..and let her fall on her ass.
Oh' God' yeah.
Okay, yoυ're not Cajun.

My soul mate? l don't know if l believe

But you get goose bumps
when you're around her. . .
. ..and butterflies?
Νo, l haven't gotten crazy like that
aboυt a girl since high school.
Matty.
What--? What happened to υs?

. ..when yoυ were playing that game.
Spin the Rapist?
Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Everybody ditched.
And that is the last thing l remember.
We don't have to get into this.
lt's a long time ago.
-lt really doesn't matter anymore.
-lt matters to me.
Just tell me.
Yoυ came out of the closet. . .

my birthday song to yoυ.
And then yoυ picked υp
and threw at me. . .
. ..with impressive force, l might add. . .
. ..the dream house that l spent
three weeks building for yoυ.
And then yoυ jυst stopped
being my friend. . .
. ..and you never spoke to me
again affer that, ever.
l'm so sorry.
Forget it, Jenna. lt was a long
time ago. lt doesn't matter.
Matt' stop being so nice to me.
l don't deserve it.
Do yoυ know what

Jenna.
Behind yoυ.
Oh' it's good to be home.

l wouldn't mind giving back
some of these wrinkles.
Okay.
lf yoυ were given one do-over,
anything in your life' what would it be?
Νothing.
-Really?
-Really.
But did you ever make
a big mistake?
Or a huge one that could
change your life? What about that?
Well' Jenna, l know
l made a lot of mistakes...
. ..but l don't regret
making any of them.
Ηow come?
Becaυse if l hadn't have
