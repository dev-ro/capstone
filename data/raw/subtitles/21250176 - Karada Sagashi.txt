[girl sighs]
- [woman on TV] According to witnesses...
- Oh, Asuka, you're up early.
I've gotta be at
the festival committee selection.
A jumper delayed the trains today,
so your dad had to head out early.
It's crazy out there. Hey!
Don't give me Dad's leftovers.
- And why not?
- Okay, thank you!
Of course, sweetie,
but can you at least sit down to eat it?
[chuckles] Mm! Delicious.
- [mom] Oh!
- [laughs]
- [weatherperson] Expect sunshine all week...
- [mom] I'll pack you a lunchbox.
- ...chance of rain...
- Today is fried shrimp.
And pumpkin croquettes.
I made too many,
so share them with your friends, okay?
...in the afternoon.
For more information on what
your future may hold this week...
Thank you.
Our fortune-telling segment
is coming up next.
Rie, the nail art you posted was so cute.
Aww, thank you!
[boy] Dude, Rie Naruto
from Class G is so hot.
- Watch out.
- Yeah, keep dreaming.
[boy 2] She's way cooler than you.
Maybe you can go for her.
No way! Asuka Morisaki?
She's, like, a total loser, man.
[boy 2] I know. The girls all ignore her.
- Why? What'd she do?
- Don't know.
Maybe hanging out with an outcast like her
puts the same loser stink on you.
- Girls are weird, man.
- Yo!
- Takahiro!
- Took your sweet time, Takahiro!
- My bad.
- Man...
- How are things with Rie?
- What?
- She came to watch you play basketball!
- Shut up, Soma. We're just friends.
- [Soma] You shut up!
- Oh! Oh, sorry!
[bell chiming]
So, you ready for today's practice?
[Takahiro] ...something.
- [boy 1] Oh yeah?
- [Takahiro] Yeah, I hope so!
[boy 1] Come on.
[van doors slam]
[cat crying]
Thanks, babe. I'll see you at the bar
after school, okay?
[man] Okay.
Bye-bye!
- [brakes squeal]
- [cat yowls]
- [boy] You see that?
- [girl] Huh?
- Whoa.
- [girl] Was that a cat?
Oh my God.
[laughter and chatter]
Is this yours, Takahiro?
Oh. Yeah, it is. Thanks.
Remember, we're on chore duty today.
I almost forgot.
Here. I got you the list
from the teachers' room.
- [chuckles] Appreciate it.
- Mm.
- That's totally you, Hina!
- Is not!
You would chase that guy down!
- [all laughing]
- What? No! Don't say that, Yuzuki.
- It's true!
- [girl 1] Oh my God.
Somebody stole the school festival money
our class was given.
- [girl 2] It was here.
- [boy 1] Who left last?
- [boy 2] Shota, right?
- [boy 3] Shota.
- Show us what you got in your desk.
- Uh...
Mm-hmm.
Sometime today.
- [Shota] Uh...
- [boy 2] Oh, that's disgusting!
What else you got? Take it out.
There. Another mystery solved.
Shota stole the festival cash!
No, no, no, no!
- You're wrong... Ow!
- [boy 2 chuckling]
- That was really messed up, Shota.
- [laughter]
[boy 3] Why'd you do it, Shota?
Owe someone money?
- [girl laughs]
- [Takahiro] What's wrong?
Well, Shota was trying to steal
our class's school festival money.
But Suzuki and the other guys found out.
Well, all's well that ends well. Right?
Uh, sorry. As class president,
I should've held onto the money.
- It's my mistake. I'm so sorry.
- [clock chiming]
Let's select the committee tomorrow.
We don't have time today.
Okay, sounds good.
An update. Festival committee selection
is tomorrow. Be ready to volunteer!

[Soma's friend] Takahiro's amazing.
Did you know he got scouted
by Keiwa High in middle school?
Why is he going to our school, then?
He told me he doesn't wanna go pro.
[Soma] Are you serious?
[cheering and applause]
[whistle blows]
[gunfire continues in game]

[Takahiro] What's going on?
Huh? Where are we?
What the hell is this?
[Rie] How did we get here?
[Takahiro] Isn't this our school's chapel?
[Rie] Wait, is that a coffin?
- Was this always here?
- [Shota] I knew it.
It was that girl I saw.
It had to be. Why me?
What? You saw the girl too?
[boy] Yeah, screw this.
Whoa. Where have you been?
[Shota] Uh, who is... is this guy, again?
[scoffs] He's in our class.
How could you forget that?
Atsushi? What are you doing here?
I don't know, and I don't care. I'm out.
- Hey, Atsushi!
- [rumbling]
Wait!
Hey, are you ever gonna
come back to class?
[door opens]

[birds twittering]
[sighs]
[gasps] Oh...
- [woman on TV] According to witnesses...
- Oh, Asuka. You're up early.
- ...victim, an office worker...
- [Asuka] I don't want breakfast.
- What?
- I had a weird dream.
- Oh, really? About what?
- ...from the platform...
Honestly, I'd rather just forget about it.
- What? You should tell me about it.
- ...inbound and outbound trains...
- No, it's fine.
- ...been suspended until further notice.
Now for the weather.
With the high-pressure front coming in...
- I'll pack you a lunchbox.
- Okay.
- ...sunshine all week.
- Today is fried shrimp.
And pumpkin croquettes.
I made too many,
so share them with your friends, okay?
- [Asuka] The same as yesterday?
- ...expected to give way...
- [brakes squeal]
- [cat yowls]
[girl 1] Oh my God...
[girl 2] Oh my God.
[kids exclaiming]
- Was that a cat?
- It's a cat.
- Did you see that?
- What happened?
- That's totally you, Hina!
- Is not!
You would chase that guy down!
- What? No! Don't say that.
- [girl 1] Oh my God.
Somebody stole the school festival money
our class was given.
- [girl 2] It was here.
- [boy 1] Who left last?
- [boy 2] Shota.
- [boy 3] Show us what's in your desk.
There. Another mystery solved.
Shota stole the festival cash!
- What the hell is "Body Search"?
- [boy 3] Why'd you do it, Shota?
Owe someone money?
- Huh? I was still talking.
- [boy 2] Where are they going?
Tell me everything!
[Shota] The ones that are chosen have to
find the victim's hidden,
dismembered body parts.
Dismembered?
I'm still, uh, sorta
translating all the details...
Wait. Is that Russian?
"The Body Search
starts exactly at midnight."
"Run away from the Red Person."
That's the thing we saw last night.
Okay, so why is today
a repeat of yesterday?
Until the Body Search is complete,
this is our only day.
You mean we'll just repeat
today over and over?
[Shota] Yes. At least until
we find all the hidden body parts.
Huh? What's with him? So creepy.
Who is he? That man.
The librarian.
His name's Mr. Yashiro, I think.
[clock chiming]
Rie, the festival committee?
Mm-hmm. Sorry, let's do it tomorrow.
[Hina] That sounds good.
Everyone, an update.
Festival committee selection is tomorrow.
Be ready to volunteer!
[rock music playing]
Ah, crap, I thought we had more lemons.
- Hey!
- Yo.
Here, lemons.
Huh? How'd you know?
Hmm? I just had a hunch, you know.
Well, thanks. You're a lifesaver.
- [chuckles]
- That's my baby girl.
Hey, where'd you park your bike?
The cops are out there.
They are? Shit.
I'm gonna go check.
Be right back.
JULY 5, TUESDAY
NAO
WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING HOME TODAY?
I USED THE MEAT AND POTATO STEW
FROM YESTERDAY TO MAKE CURRY.
[door opens]
[turns phone over]
[bartender] It's safe.
- [whistle blows]
- [boys shouting]
[man] Switch players!
- Tie your shoes. You'll trip again.
- Oh yeah?
[grunts] Ow!
[kids chattering]
[Atsushi] Why am I here again?
[Rie] So it really does keep going...
[Shota] I'm guessing we're supposed
to put the body parts we find in here...
[Rie] But if that thing finds us again...
- [Takahiro] We don't have a choice.
- [Atsushi] What?
Are you joking?
Well, I'm not gonna
play this stupid game, okay?
- Let's look upstairs.
- [Rie] Mm-hmm.
[distant banging]
[sighs]
I mean, where do we even start?
- [clunk]
- [gasps]
[panting] Oh!
Huh?
- [intense, scary music playing]
- Huh?
[gasps]
- Takahiro.
- I told you not to make a sound.
Why'd you turn the lights on?
It's a lot easier
than searching in the dark.
But the Red Person's gonna find us.
Still pretty freaked out, aren't you?
What?
That's why I'm going around turning on
the lights in all the classrooms.
Oh, clever.
Oh, I looked over there already.
[sighs] Okay...
Well, I guess there's nothing here.
Next classroom.
Hang on.
I haven't searched that room yet.

[intense, creepy music playing]
An arm? Why?
- It's part of the Body Search.
- [clank]
[lights clicking and humming]
It found us.
[creaking]
[Asuka] What do we do?
Asuka, you take this,
and go to the chapel.

[Rie and Rumiko whimpering]
Wait! Morisaki's still out there!
Move! We need to run or we'll die!
Hurry!
[Rie] Is that...
[Asuka] It's one of the body parts
we've been looking for.
[Rumiko gasps]
What the hell? Gross.
I need to get this into the coffin.
[loud crash]
Oh! Rie!

[birds twittering]
[bell dinging]
[cat crying]
Gotcha.
You gotta stay off the street, buddy.
Good, it's safe!
So, how'd it go last night?
Honestly, we got killed off pretty early.
We were totally freaked out, right?
I didn't last much longer.
But I did get the arm in the coffin.
[Rumiko] You did?
Great job, Rie!
- Yay! Yay!
- [Takahiro chuckles]
[Rumiko] Yay! We got this!
Why is Rie hanging out with that loser?
A car speeds by and splashes
you with water. What do you do?
[Hina] Hmm...
What is that? A love letter?
[boy 1] It's none of your business.
- What's going on?
- [girl 1] Oh my God.
Somebody stole the school festival money
that our class was given.
It's right here!
Suzuki was keeping it safe for me.
I was worried I was gonna lose it.
Thank you.
- Yeah, whatever.
- [scoffs]
- Aww, thanks!
- [Shota] Huh?
[chuckles] Oh, uh,
what seems to be the trouble here?
- [woman] Your two tarts.
- [Rumiko] Think we ordered too much?
[Rie] Everything's gonna reset anyway.
Who cares?
[Rumiko] Good point.
[upbeat pop music playing]
Rumiko, I wanted to ask.
Is that biker that drops you off
every morning your boyfriend?
Mm...
- Yeah.
- A college guy?
No, he's not a student.
He works at a club.
- [both, in unison] Like a bar?
- Shh! Quiet!
Honestly...
I've been feeling like he might be
cheating on me for a while now,
so I checked out his phone, right?
And it turns out I'm his side piece!
[laughing]
Yeah, okay.
- Laugh, or I'm taking this.
- [Asuka] What?
- [Rumiko] You're not eating it!
- [Asuka] I was!
- Then start laughing.
- [both] Ah-ha-ha!
- Try and stop me.
- [Rie] Hey!
- Come on.
- [Asuka] Fine, I'm taking this.
- [Rumiko] Don't think so.
- [in English] ♪ Run away to our land ♪
♪ Fly away, oh, run away to our land ♪
♪ Fly away, run away to our land
You and I... ♪
All done!
[Rumiko] Asuka!
- You're so cute! Nice, Rie!
- I try.
[shower running]
[electricity crackling]
- [Rie] I think it's close.
- [Rumiko] What do we do?
- Dive down.
- What?
[all gasping]
- [Asuka] Where is it?
- [Rumiko] She must have left.
- [all panting]
- [Rie] Thank God.
That was really brave, Asuka!
I'm sorry!
No, you really saved us. Thank you.
Ah!
Gotcha! [laughing]
[all laughing]
Oh my God!
You scared us!
- [Rumiko] Ah, I'm gonna die!
- [all laughing]
[Rie] I really love
hanging with you two.
[Rumiko] Really? You always look so happy
with all your friends, though.
Mm. Yeah, but...
Aah!
[gasps]
- [screaming]
- Oh no!
[whimpering]
[intense dissonant music playing]
[gasping]
[screams]
[dissonant music fades]
[Shota] Great.
Looks like the girls can all make it.
- [Takahiro] Okay...
- [Shota] Atsushi too?
[Takahiro] Hmm. He's read my texts, but...
He hasn't come to school
for a while, has he?
You two went to the same middle school,
right? You know him, Takahiro?
Mm.
Yeah.
Thing is, in middle school,
he was a star athlete.
He got scouted
for Keiwa High's basketball team.
But before graduation,
he hurt his leg and lost the offer.
TAKAHIRO ISE
COME TO SCHOOL
[Shota] So that's how
he ended up at our school.
[Takahiro] His doctor said he'd be able to
play again, but he just quit basketball.
[gunfire in game]
[Rie] So this is where it started?
[Shota] Yeah. I was looking
for information on the Body Search
when I discovered a connection
to a real-life murder case.
[Takahiro] And Shota printed copies
for all of us.
Thirty years ago, somebody was murdered
and dismembered right near our campus.
Dismembered?
For real?
Look. It says
the victim's head was never found.
2ND GRADE GIRL'S DISMEMBERED BODY
HEAD YET TO BE FOUND
The victim was the girl in this picture?
Miko Onoyama, only eight.
MIKO ONOYAMA (AGE: 8)
[Takahiro]The Red Person
looks about her age...
[squelching]
[screams]
- Whoa!
- [gasping]
Are you okay, Asuka?
[Asuka] The picture... it moved...
Huh? Hold on a sec.
Since when are you so close?
Wait, are these guys...
- I've known her since kindergarten.
- [Shota and Rumiko] What?
Are you serious?
You never told us about that, Asuka!
[chuckles] One time, I went to
an amusement park with her family...
- No, don't tell them about that!
- Come on, it's a good story.
[Rumiko] Ooh-ooh-ooh!
- [Shota] Oh, we've gotta hear this!
- [Shota and Rumiko laughing]
[Rumiko gasps]
Excuse me.
This is a library. Be quiet.
[all] Sorry.
Is this...
some sort of club activity?
Ah, no.
We're just... friends.
[hopeful music playing]
That was weird.
So, I, uh... I sketched out
the school's floor plan.
Here. Ta-da!
[Takahiro] Whoa! Nice work, Shota.
- You drew all this?
- [Shota chuckles] Um...
Assuming all the body parts are on campus,
we stand the best chance of finding them
if we work as a team.
Everyone, grab a pen, and mark
the places you've already searched.
And why are we doing this, exactly?
[Shota] Glad you asked!
"Rock-n-Roller Tac Plan."
- Have you always been this way?
- [Shota] Excuse me?
[laughing]
[Shota] A rock-n-roll plan
that's guaranteed to crush.
Going off our experience thus far,
I think the Red Person
is drawn to our position
when we make noise.
- [rock music playing]
- [Shota] Here's the deal.
If we play loud music across the school,
it'll disguise our movements.
PA ROOM
That'll make it really hard
for it to find us.
Beyond that, if we strategically turn
on the lights all around the school,
I think the Red Person
will be lured to those spots.
Oh, Red Person!
Come out now and get us!
How do you like us now? Come get us!
[Shota] I'll buy as much time as I can.
In the meantime, you guys split up
and find the body parts.
[all] Copy that.
Takahiro! Okay, the Red Person's
en route to the gym.
[Takahiro] Copy that. It just walked in.
[rock music continues]
[Rie] Shota! I'll toss the abdomen
out the window, you take it to the chapel!
- Nice!
- [Rumiko] Yay!
Whoa.
[rock music continues]
[glass shattering]
[rock music continues]
[grunting]
[screams]
[Shota] We'll focus on searching
the fourth floor today.
[rock music continues]
[laughing]
- [rock music ends]
- Uh...
[Mr. Yashiro] Excuse me.
This is a library. Be quiet.
[all] Sorry.
- Yes, sir.
- [Asuka] I'm sorry.
[Mr. Yashiro] Is this
some sort of club activity?
- Oh, we're putting together a dead body.
- [coughs]
What? He's not gonna remember tomorrow.
- [Shota] I can't believe you said that.
- [Rumiko] So what?
- [Shota] It's messed up!
- [Rumiko] Why?
- [Shota] What do you mean, why?
- [Rumiko] He's gonna forget. Who cares?
- [Rumiko screams]
- [Asuka on radio] Rumiko!
- [Takahiro] On my way!
- [Shota] Shall I come to you?
[Takahiro] Shota, stay there!
[Rie] Asuka, no!
- The Red Person's outside the window!
- [glass smashing]
- Asuka!
- [feedback crackling]
[Takahiro] Shota! I'm heading
to the first floor right now.
I've got the left leg, but you're gonna
need to take it to the chapel for me.
[panting]
Shota!
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[gasps]
[sighs] Damn it.
Did we fail again?

were you gonna sit out there, man?
[chuckles]
Shut up.

Here we go...
I'll take the leg!

Whoo! Come on, get in here!
- [girls laughing]
- [Rie] Watch out!
[Rumiko] Look at him go!
- [Shota] The water's great!
- [Takahiro] Hey.
You got some good moves
for a retired athlete, you know that?
- Oh, shut up.
- [laughs]
- Just 'cause you looked so pathetic.
- Oh!
- And here's your change.
- [Rumiko] Great, thank you!
Here.
Okay, then!
That means there's only the head left now!
[all] Cheers!
[Asuka] I guess it started out
with something small.
Our freshman year,
I caught a cold and missed the swim meet.
So someone started a rumor.
They said I was faking it.
After I got better
and went back to school,
nobody would even talk to me anymore.
Before I knew it...
I think I just sort of became invisible
to everyone around me.
I thought I could
just deal with it until graduation.
I was okay with being alone.
I'm sorry.
[Asuka] Huh?
It's just,
you've been suffering alone for so long,
and I...
I never even noticed.
[boy 1] Hey, ladies. What's up?
- [Rumiko] I'm not interested!
- [boy 2] Where are you going?
- Takahiro, look.
- [Rumiko] Leave us alone!
[boy 2] We got, like,
a barbecue thing going on.
- Come drink with us!
- Hey, what's going on?
What?
- Stay out of this, asshole.
- Hey!
Hey, she's cute too.
- Hey, hey.
- Don't touch her.
- You wanna go?
- Back off!
Yo, what?
You guys wanna get your ass kicked?
Uh... Hey, jerk!
We look death in the eye every single ni...
How's that for some death?
[Atsushi] What's your problem?
- [Takahiro] That's it!
- [boy 3] Come on!
- [Takahiro] Hey. Hey!
- It's on!
[Rumiko] Guys, stop it!
- Come on! Yes!
- [groans]
I said stop!
- [boy 1] Oh. Oh!
- [Rumiko yells]
- [Asuka] Let me go!
- [boy 3] Stop...
- Whoa! That's cold!
- [laughing] Oh!
- [boy 3] Whoa!
- [both grunting]
[Atsushi] Run!
- [Rumiko] Rie! Rie!
- [Takahiro] Asuka!

[Asuka] But why do you think
the six of us were chosen?
[Takahiro] Ah, who knows?
[music fades]
[waves breaking gently]
[birds chirping]
[rustling]
[Atsushi] So, no idea
where the head could be?
[Takahiro] No. We've split up and searched
everywhere, but still no luck.
[Rumiko] So this is where
that girl was murdered?
[Shota] Yeah. This is it.
We gotta go in and find something useful.
[eerie music playing]
[bird screeches]
[boards creaking]
[metal clanks]
[Rie] What do we do?
[Shota] L-Let's keep going.
Uh, you guys first...
[creaking]
[Rumiko] What is that?
[Shota] That's the same doll
the Red Person carries.
So the girl who lived here was sick
and couldn't go to school.
ME, EMILY, PAPA, MAMA
She spent every day in this house,
being treated.
ME
[Rie] So, all she had was that doll...
ME, EMILY
[Takahiro] Emily?
She loved Emily.
You can tell by the pictures.
Hey, doesn't that wall look weird?
- All right. Ready?
- [Atsushi] Ready.
[Shota] D-Do you think
the head's in there?
- [Rie] Stop it.
- [Rumiko] Aah! Don't say that!
[Shota] Should we really do this?
[Atsushi] Well, we can't stop now.
[Shota] I guess not...
[Atsushi] Oh, man...
[eerie music playing]
[Shota] Emily the doll.
Is that the little girl's blood on her?
- [door slams]
- [all yelp]
[Rie gasps] What was that?
- [Shota yells]
- [all screaming]
[all gasping]
[Asuka] Emily's gone...
[Rumiko] How?
[Shota] I don't know! Let's just go!
It's not opening!
- [Atsushi] Pull it!
- [Rie] Hurry!
No, no, no...
[wails] Something's got me!
- Help me!
- You idiot!
- What are you doing?
- No!
[Rumiko] Come on!
[bird screeching]
[Atsushi] What was with that doll?
[Rumiko] It just disappeared.
But only after you got scared
and started screaming!
What, you're saying
that it's my fault now?
[sighs] Okay. Can we go?
[eerie music playing]
[Rumiko] It's not on the second floor.
And it's definitely not in the chapel.
[Shota] I figured
it had to be somewhere close.
[Atsushi] Maybe we should
look somewhere else?
[Takahiro] Does this feel off
to anyone else?
[Asuka] Huh?
The Red Person usually
shows up way before now...
[door slams]
[Rumiko gasps]
Now what?
[dramatic, creepy music playing]
[Shota] I don't see anyone.
[rumbling]
[gasps] Over there!
[Shota] The Red Person!
[creaking]
- [Rumiko] What's it doing?
- [crunching]
[Shota] Is that Emily the doll?
[scaffolding clattering]
[screeching]
[kids gasping]
Come on!
[all panting]
[Takahiro] Upstairs!
[crashing]
[glass smashing]
[loud crashing]
[Shota screams]
[Takahiro] Start a fire!
- [Rie] What was that thing?
- I don't know!
[Red Person screeching]
What the hell?
[snarling]
[Takahiro] Is this thing
the Red Person and Emily?
[girls whimpering]
[Asuka] Takahiro...

I can't find the cat.
- [brakes squeal]
- [cat yowls]
- [girl 1] Was that a cat?
- [boy] You see that?
- [Asuka] Huh?
- [girl 2] Oh my God.
- I'd chase him down.
- [laughing]
- That's so you.
- What do you think it means?
- [Yuzuki] It means she hates rejection...
- She isn't here!
- [Takahiro] Rie's name is gone.
- I can't find her desk, either.
Festival committee selection is starting!
Take your seats, everyone!
If nobody feels like volunteering...
What's Sawada doing?
Hey, why are you doing Rie's job?
The class president should be doing that.
- What?
- Rie? Who's that?
What?
Hey, has anyone seen Rie today?
[all murmuring confusion]
Atsushi?
[Atsushi] Hey!
What the hell do you mean, Rie's gone?
We don't know!
But today's all different for some reason.
[Asuka] Last night, Rie...
[Takahiro] What happened?
- Rie got eaten by Emily.
- [gasps]
What does that mean?
It means if the monster eats you, your
whole existence gets completely erased!
Are you kidding me? What do we do?
We can't do shit.
It's gonna be dark soon.
- But if we all get eaten, then we...
- [Rumiko] Enough!
We'll all be erased
before we find that head.
There's no way out!
[Asuka] Is that plastic bag...
[Mr. Yashiro] It was run over
in front of the school.
Mr. Yashiro, do you know
what the Body Search is?
What?
[suspenseful music playing]
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whenever we got together to do research
on the Body Search,
you were always watching us.
Look!
[wind whistling]
I knew exactly when this pot would fall,
to the second.
Please, tell me what you know
about the Body Search.
[Mr. Yashiro] I think
I was a senior in high school
when I was dragged into my Body Search.
What do you mean, "think"?
I'd forgotten it.
What?
[Mr. Yashiro] Until I found this book.
I kept thinking...
that I had great friends
I spent my high school years with.

Friends I couldn't remember.
That's her name...
We were in different classes,
we never even spoke to each other.
CLASS 3-A
YUKO SHIRAISHI
And yet...
I'm sure she meant everything to me.
At least, I think so.
Today, I can't remember how I really felt.
Once the Body Search is over,
your memories of it go away.
So, then,
all of your friends that you did
the Body Search with, they were...
Forgotten.
Oh no...
[somber music playing]
[Rumiko] Why has the Red Person
become that monster?
[Shota] Maybe we, like, woke the doll up
or something when we were in the house.
[Takahiro] We need to figure out
a way to avoid the monster
and find the missing head.
Damn it, where the hell is it?
[Shota] I know. I'm pretty sure
we've searched every inch of the school
at least twice by now.

[bird calling]
[Takahiro] Thought you'd gone home.
Takahiro...
[Takahiro] Are you okay?
[Asuka] To be honest...
I'm afraid.
Today might be the day
we all disappear.
Don't count us out before we even try.
You never know.
[chuckles]
Kinda ironic coming from me, though.
[Asuka] Hmm?
When I got scouted...
I told Keiwa High
I wasn't interested in going pro.
Truth is...
when things got serious,
I got scared that I'd fail.
That's who I am.
I'm always giving up on things
before I even try.
Pretty lame, right?
No more.
I'm done running.
Asuka, I...
I swear I'll protect you.
I've got your back.
Once the Body Search is over,
we can finally see tomorrow.
If tomorrow does come...
I'll disappear again.
I'll be invisible to everyone.
Invisible to you.
What are you saying?
[heartfelt piano music playing]
So, if you're right...
and you really do disappear tomorrow...
I promise, I'll find you.
Takahiro...
[jingling]
Here, I swear on this clip.
I will find you.
[Asuka] I have a theory.
I think the head might be inside the doll.
[Shota] Okay... What makes you say that?
[Asuka] Well, when I saw it in the pool...
Emily the doll
sank into the water head first.
That means the thing
we've been looking for the entire time
is inside the head of the monster.
[sighs]
[sighs]
[somber music playing]
[machinery grinding]
[Rumiko] Asuka,
that clip looks so good on you.
[liquid sloshing]
Once this is all over and done with,
I know Rie will come back to us.
[whirring]
[clicking]
Hey.
I figured out why the six of us
were chosen. I think I get it now.
Tell us why.
Because that monster...
was drawn to us
by the cracks in our hearts.
It's our loneliness come to life.
Our loneliness come to life?
[wistful music playing]
[Atsushi] If that's the case...
then we take it down together.
Night after night,
you guys failed over and over,
but didn't give up.
Hearing that made me feel like a moron,
focusing on just one bad thing.
Moron!
Shut up.
[claps]
[snarling]
[low rumbling]
- [clattering]
- [Shota] It's here!
Everyone, get ready!
We're gonna stop that monster
and put that head back where it belongs.
Just don't let it eat you!

JULY 6, WEDNESDAY
[rain pouring outside]
[Asuka sighs]
[woman] Police were called yesterday
when, during a renovation
of the chapel at Acacia Academy,
a construction worker
- discovered a human skull...
- [man] Isn't that your school, Asuka?
...in a well on the school grounds.
- Yeah, it is.
- Oh, wow. That's so scary.
The skull has been identified
as belonging to an elementary schoolchild.
- It may be linked to a 30-year-old murder...
- Fried chicken, mini cheese omelets.
- I made too much, so share with friends.
- ...identity of the victim...
- ...still under investigation.
- Thank you.
[laughter and chatter]
[teacher] Good morning!
Good morning.
Go ahead inside.
[laughter]
[boy] Ew!
[boys laughing and coughing]
[locker door slamming]
Shota, what's wrong?
- [boy 1] Hey, Shota!
- [boy 2] Shota!
We didn't get any volunteers,
so we'll draw for our committee members.
- [all groaning]
- All right!
- Everybody draw one from the box.
- [boy] Oh, man. This sucks!
LOTTERY BOX
[Rie] Kiyomiya!
They said my attendance
was too low. So, hey.
- [Rie] Hey.
- Who's that guy?
[Hina] Take a slip from the box, please!
Ugh!
Come on!
[Hina] Our new school festival
committee members
should get together in the committee room
on the chapel's second floor after school.
YOU'VE BEEN SELECTED
- [Rumiko] Why do we have to meet now?
- [Rie] See you there.
[Rumiko] This sucks.
[Shota] Honestly, I don't even care
about the school festival...
- [Rumiko] I didn't ask.
- [Atsushi] Wait, this is every week?
[Rie] Hmm... I think it's every
Wednesday and Friday?
[Shota] We got flyers, right?
- [Rumiko] Who cares?
- [Shota] I'm pretty sure we did.
[Rumiko] Whatever.
Is this...
Asuka!
Whoa, I didn't know they knew each other.
Did you?
I told you...
I'd find you.
