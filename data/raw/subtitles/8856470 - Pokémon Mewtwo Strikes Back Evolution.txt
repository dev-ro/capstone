The Mythical Pokémon... Mew.
They say it’s extinct,
but there have been reports of sightings.
- Those reports haven’t been confirmed.
- Yes, sir.
There hasn’t even been
a decent photo taken of it.
Unfortunately true.
It’s Mew.
Having phenomenal powers
that can cause massive flooding,
or plant life to bloom in the wild,
bestowing some of these powers
on humankind.
Is it good or evil?
Is it doing this on a whim?
No matter what, one thing is for certain.
It wields great power.
This is the fossil we just excavated.
- It’s from the body of Mew!
- That’s our theory.
Let’s get this
back to the lab immediately!
If it truly is a Mew fossil...
Then we may be able to recreate
the most powerful of all Pokémon!
Where am I?
Who... am I?
Who are you?
I cannot forget the world...
where a certain someone flew away from me.
Who... am I?
Why am I here?
No.
I am simply here.
That is all.
I haven’t emerged into this world.
Huh?
It’s finally awakened!
Mewtwo!
Mewtwo?
Hm.
- Telepathy.
- Ah.
Mewtwo. That is your name.
We have given life to you,
using the rarest of Pokémon as a basis.
Yes. That is the rarest
of the world’s Pokémon, Mew.
Mew...
Would that be my parent?
My father? My mother?
- Maybe either or maybe neither.
- Huh.
Your existence is based on Mew,
but you were created to be even stronger.
Who created me?
Neither father nor mother?
Then nature?
Then, are you saying
that I was created by nature?
In this world,
only two things can create life,
nature and human science.
You did? You humans made me?
- It’s a triumph of science!
- Proof we were right!
We can continue our research!
We should start
an even better version!
Who am I?
Where am I?
Congratulations.
I can't believe this.
- I can't believe we did it.
- Congratulations.
For what purpose was I created?
Huh?
Everyone,
we need to leave immediately!
Go, go, go!
Creating the most powerful Pokémon
in the world,
it was our goal and ultimate dream!
Is this my power?
Am I the most powerful Pokémon
in the world?
Mew... am I stronger than you?
Hm?
It’s true that you may be
the world’s most powerful Pokémon.
But the world has
one other powerful life-form.
Humans.
If you were to join forces with humans,
the world would belong to us.
The world would belong to us.
However, if you were
to simply let your powers loose,
the world’s destruction
would be the only outcome.
Your powers must be controlled.
- Controlled?
- Will you let them run wild
and do to the world
the same thing you did to this island?
What must I do?
You place armor on me that protects me,
yet holds back my power.
After all of this,
what do you expect of me?
It’s simple. You only need
to do what everyone in this world does.
And what is that?
Destruction, war and conquest.
The strong will stand victorious.
Where am I?
Who am I?
Ah!
For what reason do I fight?
For what reason do I live?
Hmm?
You are a Pokémon.
Pokémon are used for human purposes.
They live for humans’ sake.
Are you telling me to fight for you?
Is that what you mean?
Are you saying I must fight for humans?
You are a Pokémon
that was created by humans.
What other value could you have?
Value?
Who am I?
For what reason do I live?
What is this?
You dare to defy humans?
I was created by humans.
But I am not human!
And as an artificial Pokémon,
I am not a Pokémon either!
Who am I?
Where am I? Who wanted me to be created?
Who asked for me to be created?
I despise
everything connected with my creation!
And so...
this is neither attack,
nor declaration of war.
You are the ones who created me.
And I will strike back... against you!
Pika-Pika!
This young man
is Ash from Pallet Town.
He’s traveling with friends
on a training journey,
aiming to become a Pokémon Master.
Pika!
Wow.
I can smell the sea!
The view is great here.
- Why don’t we have lunch?
- All right!
- Man, am I starving.
- Pikachu.
Even after extra helpings
at the Pokémon Center this morning?
- That was breakfast! This is lunch!
- Pika-Pika.
You can’t battle
on an empty stomach, right?
- Eating is part of training.
- Oh yeah! You said it!
- That’s our Brock!
- Pikachu.
Just be sure to help
with setting the table.
- Sure! I’m all over it!
- Pika-Pika!
Pika-Pika, Pika!
Pikachu. Pika-Pika.
Pika!
Aw, I’m out of gas!
But, Ash, you know we’re not done!
I’m so hungry,
I can’t move another muscle.
- Oh, come on!
- Misty?
You have to let it simmer slowly
until it’s just right.
You can’t rush stew,
or Pokémon, for that matter. Hm.
Oh!
Pika-Pika. Pikapi.
Pika.
Pika-Pika.
Pika?
Pika?
Pi! Pika!
- Pika!
- Huh?
Hey! You, little boy!
Are you Ash from Pallet Town?
Huh? Yeah, that’s right.
Okay! Does that mean we can have
a Pokémon battle?
Okay!
If somebody wants to battle, why not?
What happened to the guy
who couldn’t move a muscle?
I can have a Pokémon battle
before breakfast.
- Maybe two!
- Pika-Pika.
You’re forgetting one thing.
You’re battling before lunch.

Huh?
- Pika-Pika!
- Yeah! We did it!
He just had a weak opponent...
Who didn’t know you can’t rush a Pokémon.
Pikachu is getting ever more skilled
by the minute!
Oh! Gorgeous!
We’ve got to get our paws
on that Pikachu
and grab it for Team Rocket,
no matter what!
Hm!
Mm. But there’s more.
Just look at that spread!
Here, Togepi, say ah!
- Togepi!
- Taste good?
- Am I hungry...
- I’ve got a frying pan.
But without something to fry,
it’s little more than a round anvil
made out of iron!
That’s Ash from Pallet Town.
And with him are Misty,
the Cerulean City Gym Leader,
and Brock, the Pewter City Gym Leader.
Master, shall we invite these people
as well?
As you wish, Master.
Hey, who are you?
Hey! Don’t do that! Stop!
Charizard never changes.
Hm. Oh, well...
This is for me?
Huh?
Pika.
Please forgive this surprise message
from a stranger.
She’s so beautiful! I can’t believe it!
You three have been acknowledged
as up-and-coming Trainers.
As such, you are invited to a party
held by my master,
the world’s greatest Pokémon Trainer.
The location?
Pokémon Palace, on New Island.
We ask that you RSVP,
whether attending or not,
by checking the box on the return card.
The greatest Pokémon Trainer alive
invites you.
We beg you to accept.
- Whoa! The pretty lady just...
- What do you think?
- I think we should go! I know we should!
- She called us up and coming.
- I don’t think that sounds bad at all!
- Pika.
So, you’re going to mark the RSVP yes?
- I sure am!
- Uh-huh.
Pika-Pika!
It’s bad manners
to rush by without even a hello!
- What’s this?
- Huh?
Pikachu!
Ra! Ra! Raticate!
- Calm down, Raticate!
- Kingler?
- Just relax. Please?
- Now, cut that out!
- And the weather was so nice before!
- Seaside weather can change in an instant.
Huh? What? The ferry’s grounded?
- So we can’t go to New Island?
- - After getting an invitation?
Please, quiet, everyone!
We have the harbor manager right here.
I’m Miranda. If you want to hear the will
of the sea, listen to the harbor Wingull.
But there’s no need.
Listen to these winds.
I've never seen a hurricane like this
in my life.
Is it really that bad?
I grew up near this harbor and I’ve never
experienced a storm like this.
And not only that, the storm is directly
over New Island, far out to sea.
I cannot in good conscience allow you
to wander into such obvious danger.
I beg you, as one sworn
to protect the harbor.
You heard her.
The ferry for today is canceled.
Well, I'm going to New Island anyway!
My Pokémon are great swimmers!
- We’ll make it to that palace, no problem!
- No!
- I know the sea and I am telling you no!
- She’s right!
If one of your Pokémon is wounded,
the Pokémon Center here
won’t be able to help it!
What does that mean?
Nurse Joy from the Pokémon Center,
she disappeared a week ago.
And with Nurse Joy missing,
your Pokémon won’t be treated.
Look. There’s the missing-person poster.
So pretty.
Huh? Haven’t I seen her somewhere before?
No, don’t!
Stop, or I’ll have to arrest you!
No.
- I knew we couldn’t stop all of them.
- Huh?
They’re Pokémon Trainers. Adventurers.
They never would’ve have come here
if they’d known they’d be stopped.
Here’s to their safety.
The greatest Trainer in the world
is out there across the sea.
- We’ve just got to get over there!
- Pika! Pika!
But, Ash, we don’t have any Pokémon
that can cross such an angry sea.
- Yeah, you’re right.
- Pikachu...
♪ The waves may be against us ♪
♪ But who cares? ♪
♪ Yeah, who cares? ♪
♪ Just grab the wheel ♪
♪ We hail from the churning waves
Of Cinnabar Strait! ♪
- Sing it out!
- ♪ When trouble pays someone a call ♪
♪ That’s when we rush to give it our all ♪
♪ That far horizon’s got our name ♪
♪ We’ll never be the same! ♪
Coming? Well, it’ll cost you.
But if ye tell a good tale,
we may just take you anyway.
- All right! Take us!
- Pika! Pika!
You know, that boat sure has great timing.
Hmm?
♪ Fits us to a tee Riding the briny sea ♪
♪ Custom-built for three ♪
♪ Riding the briny sea fits us to a tee
♪ Riding the briny sea fits us to a tee ♪
♪ Riding the briny sea... ♪
Togepi, stay in there for a while.
Is this boat really safe,
bobbing in all these waves?
It’s just like taking a bath.
Wet at first, but soon, you’ll take to it.
Captain! Isn’t it about time?
Aye! Aye!
With one click.
I’ve heard of being wet behind the ears,
but this is nuts!
It’s you three!
Team Rocket!
It was about time for you guys to show up.
Why are you here?
- Prepare for trouble, what a thing to say.
- And make it double.
Ash! Misty!
Where’s Ash and Pikachu?
I don’t know.
Pika...
Whoa. Do you see that?
Thanks a lot, Staryu.
- Squirtle, you were great!
- Squirtle! Squirtle!
My compliments on your arrival.
Present your invitation,
if you would please.
These three are the recipients
of the invitation.
- Huh. I knew it! So it was you after all.
- What?
You’re Nurse Joy, from the harbor poster.
Come to think of it,
they do look alike.
I don’t understand.
I have been a servant here at this palace
ever since the beginning.
Now, if you will follow me.
The other invited guests
have already arrived.
Wow.
Oh!
Hm.
Whoa!
These are the other guests
I was telling you about.
Wait. Just three of them?
But there were so many more
on the ferry landing.
If a Trainer couldn’t make it here
through the storm,
then they wouldn’t have been invited.
Are you saying
that the storm was a test?
Please release your Pokémon
from their Poké Balls and take a seat.
The six of you who have gathered,
you are all chosen Trainers.
Okay, how do we get into the palace, eh?
Our only choice is to go in
through the exit.
But I don’t see one.
Down there.
Huh?
A sewer?
- Sewers are not my habitat!
- They are now!
There’s no other way, so toughen up!
- Uh, what’s wrong?
- Nothing. Let’s go.
♪ Climbing the scary rail
Live to tell the tale! ♪
♪ Climbing the scary rail... ♪
- Squirtle! Squirtle!
- Bulba!
Pika! Pi! Pi! Pi!
So you made it here, too?
- So did you. But how?
- We simply took to the skies.
A little hurricane means nothing
to Pidgeot, does it?
Pidgeot!
Everyone, say hello.
I just rode over here on Gyarados’ back!
Isn’t Gyarados known
as the Atrocious Pokémon?
- Uh-huh.
- Huh?
I’m here with this one
and those over there.
Blastoise!
Just lovely.
Blastoise, Dewgong, Vileplume, Ninetales,
Rapidash and your Wigglytuff, too!
And yet, nothing can compare
to their lovely Trainer!
Your boundless beauty. My queen.
My lady, once this storm passes,
let’s gaze upon the sun-drenched seas
and eat my famous jelly donuts
made with love...
Yeah, if you’re going to eat,
you’re better off eating alone.
Huh?
Thank you all.
I’d now like to present
the world’s strongest Pokémon Trainer,
who will now join you.
Blastoise.
- What is that?
- Pika?
Huh?
Hm.
Eh?
Eh!
Hm.
Ha!
Hm. Huh?
- Meowth!
- Huh?
Hm?
So, my master is not only
the strongest Pokémon Trainer,
but also the strongest Pokémon
in existence... Mewtwo.
- Mewtwo?
- Pika.
A Pokémon can't be a Pokémon Trainer!
No way!
- Are you sure?
- What’s that voice?
It’s telepathy.
I am the one
who chooses my own rules.
If this is a bad joke, I’m going home!
Get it, Gyarados!
Gyarados, use Hyper Beam!
Gyarados!
That was trivial.
I have no more use for you.
- I knew it. Nurse Joy!
- Where am I?
What am I doing here?
I brought you here
from the Pokémon Center to look after me.
It is convenient
to have an expert well versed
in the physiology of a Pokémon’s body.
You were quite useful.
- I suppose you remember nothing, correct?
- What did you say?
With my power, it is easy to control
something as simple as the human brain.
- That’s just awful!
- Pika-Pika!
What kind of a place is this?
It doesn’t look like
a treasure vault.
- How cute can you get?
- You think that’s cute?
Our research has produced
a device that can make clones of Pokémon.
With this, we found great success.
- What’s going on?
- Meowth! Meowth!
Wait! Stop that thing!
Look what you did to my precious fur!
Three hairs.
It needn’t be much.
If we can study a Pokémon’s tissue,
we can make a clone of that Pokémon.
- Who’s that Pokémon?
- It's Meowth!
Whoa!
- Meowth?
- But I’m Meowth.
Then this is...
- A Meowth clone?
- Please!
However, one clone I made
was different from the rest.
From the Mythical Pokémon Mew,
found deep in the jungle,
we discovered the tiniest of fossils.
And from that,
I was able to bring forth Mewtwo,
creating the most powerful Pokémon
in the world.
That was our dream.
However...
Then this...
Is a lab
for creating Pokémon clones?
Wait, why isn’t there anybody here?
Maybe it’s their day off.
If that’s true, they must need it.
Man...
At one point,
I thought I’d work alongside humans.
But I was disappointed.
Humans are a dangerous species,
inferior even to Pokémon.
If cruel, weak humans
are allowed to govern the planet,
the world is headed for ruin.
Who will rule the world?
I suppose a Pokémon like you?
Pokémon are unfit as well.
After all, they allowed humans to rule
in the first place.
For some Pokémon, the purpose
of their lives is to serve humans.
Pikachu! Pikachu!
What’s this?
You say you do not serve this human?
That you are with him
because you like this Trainer?
Pika!
You are as pathetic as the rest.
Pika...
Pikachu...
- Pikachu?
- Pikachu!
Weak Pokémon nestle under a human’s wing.
- Ash! Are you all right?
- Yeah.
How dare you do that to Pikachu!
No matter the Pokémon,
there shouldn’t be any Pokémon
that can’t be caught!
Go! Rhyhorn, I choose you!
- Rhyhorn!
- Wigglytuff.
A waste of time.
Since my creation, I’ve been far stronger
than any Pokémon alive!
You sure? You never know until you try!
Pika.
You want to try?
I’m not liking this at all.
Blastoise Clone.
Venu.
Mew. Mew. Mew. Mew!
- What was that?
- Beats me.
It said "mew".
Venusaur.
Humans aspiring
to become Pokémon Trainers,
first choose from three Pokémon
anyone can get.
Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander.
These before you are their evolved forms.
- They are my copies.
- Copies? Huh?
- A battle arena!
- Are we being challenged to a battle?
I choose to battle
with Bruteroot the Venusaur!
Venusaur.
And my partner? I choose Shellshocker!
Blastoise.
Me, too! Charizard, I choose you!
- Charizard! I didn't say start.
- Pika. Pika.
Your Charizard is poorly trained.
Which of you will oppose me first?
I underestimated you once,
but that won’t happen again!
Saur!
Venu.
Go, Bruteroot! Use Razor Leaf!
Use Vine Whip.
Venusaur!
Venusaur.
Venusaur!
Use Energy Ball!
Saur!
Yes!
Venusaur.
Oh!
Use Leaf Storm.
Venusaur!
Sau-saur!
Venusaur.
Bruteroot!
Are you okay?
I’m battling you now!
Go, Shellshocker! Use Skull Bash!
- Blastoise!
- Use Skull Bash.
Blastoise!
Blastoise!
Shellshocker, use Hydro Pump!
Blastoise!
Shellshocker!
Blast...
Ash, be careful!
Their moves are really strong!
Yeah, I know! But don’t worry.
None of those attacks can hurt you
as long as they don’t hit you!
Hm.
Okay, Charizard! Win it with speed!
- How are you going to win it with speed?
- Ugh. They’re too fast.
Pika! Pika!
Charizard!
Use Seismic Toss.
- Charizard!
- Pika!
It seems you lack both speed and power.
- Huh?
- Pika?
Pi. Pi. Pika!
Shellshocker!
Venusaur.
- Bruteroot!
- Are you trying to steal our Pokémon?
Steal? No.
I am only making
more useful, stronger clones
from these Pokémon,
of which you are so proud.
Making clones?
- Stop it! You can’t do that!
- Do not attempt to defy me!
I make my own rules!
- Here they come!
- Run, everybody!
Pikachu!
Gyarados!
Seadra!
Rapidash.
Tuff!
Pi. Pi. Pika!
Pika. Pi. Pi. Pikachu!
Pidgeot!
We’ve just got to get them
into their Poké Balls!
A waste of time.
- Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!
- Bulbasaur.
Got 'em!
That’s not possible.
Anything is possible
with the Poké Balls I make!
- Be very quiet in there.
- Togepi.
Psyduck!
No! Psyduck!
Psyduck...
Vulpix.
Vulpix! No!
Pika. Pika. Pikachu.
Pika. Pika!
- Pikachu, run away.
- Pikachu!
- Run!
- Pi. Pi. Pikachu.
Pi. Pika. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pikachu.
Pi. Pi. Pi...
Pikachu!
Pi. Pi. Pi...
Don’t let them get you! Pikachu!
Pi. Pi. Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Pi. Pi. Pi. Pika. Pika!
Oh!
Pika. Pikachu!
Pika. Pi. Pika. Pikachu.
Pika. Pika. Pika!
Pikachu!
Pika!
Ah! Pikachu!
Who's that Pokémon?
It’s Scyther!
It’s Dewgong!
It’s Vileplume!
Sandslash. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.
And then of course, this one’s Meowth.
- Ow!
- Huh?
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...
It’s the Twerp!
Team Rocket!
I don’t have time
for your dumb motto today!
- Wait!
- Hey!
Who’s that Pokémon?
It’s Pikachu.
- Pika.
- Pikachu.
Pika. Pi.
Pi. Pika.
Pikachu!
Whoa! Look at all the copies.
Golduck.
- Hitmonlee.
- Scyther.
- There’s no stopping them.
- Send in the clones.
- Those are... clones?
- Pika?
Vaporeon.
Huh? The originals too?
Stay out of my space!
Squirtle!
- Squirtle!
- Pika! Pika!
- Squirtle! Squirtle! Squirtle! Squirtle!
- Pikachu!
Bulba.
- Bulbasaur!
- Pikachu! Pika!
- Squirtle.
- Pikachu.
- Pika.
- Squirtle. Squirtle.
Humans, I have no desire
to cause you harm.
Simply go home now!
Huh?
That is, if you can make it home
through the storm.
What was that?
You can’t do this.
I won’t let you!
- It’s Ash!
- All right!
Psyduck.
- It’s Psyduck!
- Vulpix!
Squirtle.
You set them free?
That’s right. I had to.
I’ll protect all my friends!
- Ash, oh, no!
- Stop it now!
What is this?
Mew. Mew.
- Huh?
- Mew. Mew. Mew!
Mew.
Mew.
- Mew.
- Huh?
Mew. Mew. Mew!
- Is that...?
- A Pokémon?
Mew...
Mew!
Mew.
Mew.
Mew. Mew!
I’ve read about that one.
Right. It’s the Mythical Pokémon.
Mew,
said to be the only one of its kind
and the strongest Pokémon alive.
Mew?
- So, it does exist.
- Yes.
However, I am the strongest Pokémon!
I may have been made from part of you.
But now I will prove
that Mewtwo is better than the original,
superior to Mew!
Mew.
Mew and Mewtwo...
Then Mewtwo was made from Mew.
- Pika.
- Squirtle.
This world is too small for two of us!
Why do you flee from me?
Are you afraid to find out
which of us is greater?
- Saur.
- Hm!
So you do have some fight in you.
But I have no time for games.
Destiny is at hand!
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?
Or your pathetic group
of inferior Pokémon?
We were created with powers far stronger
than the originals!
- Hm, it’s talking truth.
- Translation?
Mew says you don’t prove anything
by showing off a lot of fancy moves.
The Pokémon’s real strength
comes from the heart!
A Pokémon’s real strength, you say?
Very well! My clones
don’t need moves to prove their worth!
Now we shall see who triumphs!
Pika...
Pika...
Pi... Pika?
Pika...
Pi!
Pika!
What good is this fighting?
They’re either originals or copies!
But they’re all alive!
This is wrong.
Even if they’re copies,
they’re all living in the same world.
Originals and copies.
They’re all living creatures!
Does winning or losing really matter?
We tell others to prepare for
trouble, but I’m not prepared for this.
It troubles my heart
to see them all this way.
It seems like
they’re only hurting themselves.
- It’s like seeing your old self...
- Battling with your present self.
A blast-off bad dream!
Huh?
I’ll bet these claws hurt.
You’ve got a lot of nerve
being here, you know?
The rest are duking it out!
Eh? You’re telling me
I’ve got even more nerve?
Just 'cause I’m not duking it out?
Oh, so you think my claws
would hurt a lot, too.
Well, your claws
would hurt a lot more, you know.
You want to know
if tonight’s gonna be a full moon?
Yup. I think tonight is gonna be
a full moon, filled to the top!
Wow. Thinking of the moon
at a time like this...
You know, palley, you’ve got class.
Pika!
Pika! Pika! Pikachu!
Pika-Pika?
Pikachu!
- Pika!
- Pika-Pika!
Pikachu!
Pika!
Pi, Pikachu, Pi, Pika...
Pika...
Pika-Pika!
Pikachu...
Stop, please! Knock it off!
- Ash!
- Ash!
I’ve got to stop this!
You can’t.
Until Mew and Mewtwo stop,
the fighting goes on.
Living things won’t give up
their territory
to other members of their own species.
That means...
They’ll battle until one is defeated...
till only one remains!
That’s how living things are?
But Mewtwo was created by humans.
And yet, it’s a living thing.
They’re alive, all right.
Both Mew and Mewtwo.
And Pikachu!
And the other Pikachu too!
Pika...
Pika...
Pika... Pika...
Will you guys stop?
Knock it off!
- What’s going on?
- What happened?
Pika...
Foolishness! A human
would actually attempt to stop our battle?
Pika...?
Pika?
Pika-Pi?
Pikachu...
Pika?
Pika-Pi?
Pikachu... Pika-Pi?
Bulba...
- Squirtle...
- Pikachu!
Pika-Pi!
Oh, no, Ash...
Pika-Pi?
Pika?
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Chu!
Pikachu!
Pikachu.
Chu!
Pika-Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Pika-Pi...
Pika-Pi! Pi!
Pika?
Pika?
Pika?
Huh?
Pika-Pi!
- Pikachu.
- Pikachu!
Togepi!
Squirtle! Squirtle!
- Saur.
- Bulbasaur!
Psy!
Pi...
Pika-Pi. Pika-Pi.
It is true that both you and I
are living beings... Pokémon.
I see now that the circumstances
of one’s birth are irrelevant.
It is what you do with the gift of life
that determines who you are.
Squirtle?
Squirtle! Squirtle!
Squirtle! Squirtle!
Huh?
Pika!
Mewtwo, where will you go?
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.
What transpired here,
I will always remember.
But perhaps for you,
these events are best forgotten.
- Pika.
- Huh?
- Huh? Whoa. Whoa.
- Pika!
Oh. Oh!
Oh!
Please, quiet, everyone!
No boats will leave the harbor!
This hurricane is stronger
than any seen here before.
You must evacuate!
Aw, why right now?
Please remain calm
and I’ll do my best to help.
The Pokémon Center will function
as a shelter, open to anyone!
Come with me, if you wish to use it.
Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny, Miranda, too!
The rainwater
hardly blurs their radiant beauty!
Huh? Why are we here in the first place?
It doesn’t make any sense.
Well, since we’re already here, who cares?
Togepi!
- Yeah. Right!
- Pika!
Hm?
Pika?
Like it never happened!
- No hurricane...
- It disappeared!
- The ships can sail first thing tomorrow.
- Right.
- Oh, what’s that?
- What’s what?
- You see that? Just up there!
- Pika?
I didn’t see anything at all.
Nothing but clouds.
On the day I set out
and decided to become a Pokémon Master,
I saw a really rare Pokémon,
just like I did now.
Well, then maybe you’ll see
that one again sometime.
- Huh?
- That really rare Pokémon!
Pika!
Mm. One day, for sure!
Pikachu!
The world of Pokémon,
full of mysteries and legends
and the stories of those who dream
of becoming Pokémon Trainers,
as well as the amazing Pokémon who live,
work and battle by their sides.
As the journey continues,
for a long time to come!
Beautiful! Everything clean and natural!
Pristine, untouched!
Now, that’s a big change.
And it sure does feel good!
It’s about time!
