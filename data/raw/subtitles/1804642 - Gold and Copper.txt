In the name of God
Seyyed Reza Khadem Nishaburi.
You excelled in all courses, thank God.
The first three years, I was in our city, Nishabur.
Then I spent two years in Mashhad, the Khan School.
And I was at the Kamali School of Yazd these last years, and now...
Yes, such honor for us.
I see you took Verse Logic with Mr.Hadj Saadat! Right?
Well done, well done.
Thanks God, now I came to Tehran
-if it's possible, and if I get the honor-
I'll take Ethics with Mr.Hadj Rahim.
MashAllah, Seyyed, you have lots of furniture!
GOLD and COPPER
Seyyed, you forgot to empty the box, it's so heavy!
Seyyed! My back hurts,
I can't breathe, wait.
Mr.Seyyed, dear, please take these cups of tea.
Thank you so much.
Atefeh, dear,
come in sweetie. Don't get cold.
I'm helping.
Don't play with them, 
you're hurting the fishes!
Only 4 people and so much furniture.
It's like they are tribe.
Why are they so annoying!
See what a lovely landlady
I found for you?
MashAllah, Ms.Azam is perfect!
Are you sure this house is suitable for us?
Assalam alaikom Mr.Hadj.
Selamun alaikom, Mr.Seyyed Reza. 
Why the rush?
I'm doing the tuition transfer,
with your permission.
It's not done yet?
A part is done. Thank God.
But it takes a month, they said.
Mr.Rahim's class wont take lots of your time.
If you like, you may teach.
Of course, the elemental courses.
You're kind Mr.Hadj. I'll study
for a while, I should learn from teachers.
There's no clash.
Honestly, with your approval,
I wish to seize all time for learning.
No one spends on books these days.
People barely read, newspapers now.
Let alone such an old book
like the one you're looking for.
'Exhumation' you said?
What did you say was the book's subject?
Ethics, Mr.Hadj.
About theoretical ethics.
Ethics? Look up there,
you may find it there.
- Would you buy a (Hafez) fortune card Mr.?
- No.
I put the house pre-payment rent
in her bank account.
Do you know, Mr.Seyyed?
Her account is for Hadj pilgrimage.
In this street, there's an ophthalmologist.
I went for your appointment, but said
he's so busy. Four more  months, he said.
Atefeh's school is so near.
Her headmistress is such a good lady.
They didn't register her,
because she is three months late.
But hearing of your studies, 
she didn't refuse.
Mr.Seyyed, please don't say no, OK?
Please command me
Tomorrow, go to the bazaar and get a new aba.
Why an aba (cloak)?
Yours is old, it's not good for Tehran.
Don't worry about money.
Are you hurt?
Let me see, God kill me.
No, it's nothing, no no.
I don't know why, somethimes my eyes see double.
And the tips of my fingers get numbed.
Might it be a serious illness Mr.Seyyed?
Zahra Sadat, what words are those.
You've been so tired for a while,
what are you saying!
- Salamun alaikom, Mr.Seyyed Reza.
- Alaikom assalam, Mr.Hadj.
May God accept.
Mr.Rahim's class will be starting
in this place from next week.
Mr.Sheikh Hadi knows that 
we have made a big effort..
..to convince him to teach this
specific course at our school.
God bless you.
So all of you should try
to attend on time and regularly.
Better if there are no irregularities
from the students. You know.
Surely.
Don't be late for your Salat. Pray for me.
Our dinner nearly burns.
I cooked some spaghetti for dear Atefeh.
If you wait little more, it shall be ready.
My dear, take this.
A beautiful coat for my dear lady.
Let me see.
Mr.Amir dont tease your father.
No, he isn't teasing.
He is just into his father's books.
Come to daddy, come to daddy.
Zehra Sadat,  I think the diaper needs be changed.
I'm comeing. Come here dear,
you get yourself dirty.
Come to mommy.
Mommy, you left again!
Dear Atefeh, please wait
a little longer, I'm coming now.
Poor brother of yours. His foot might singe.
I'm tired!
Zehra Sadat, could you please tell
this lady to behave according her age.
No, Seyyed, Ms.Azam is not alone.
She lives with a girl. Her grandchild I think.
God knows why she hides her!
Mr.Amir is now clean as a flower!
Mr.Seyyed please turn off the stove,
so the food doesn't burn.
Zehra Sadat, when I was doing the ablution,
what did you tell me?
It was nothing important.
Seyyed, after your aba, let's 
go to the carpet market.
To Mr.Hadj Mohammad, a good man I know.
You may sell him your carpet.
It's far from ready. We have lots of time.
I know, I said it to flatter the mother of Amir Ali,
so she finds me a good girl.
I don't why, no one lets their daughters
marry students of religious sciences.
If you were as lucky as 
our classmate, Hadi Dorchei.
He got to marry the girl of a rich jeweler.
A good life in this and the other world.
Yes. Laugh, laugh. You never 
taste the pain of loneliness.
I spend days just working and studying at school.
And at nights challenging the devil.
AstaghfirAllah.
Look! It's beautiful.
It must be... very beautiful.
What's the matter dear, see what a nice girl.
Dear Atefeh, please take these things.
Sweetie, take those dishes too.
I bring the rice.
Mommy?
Yes, dear.
Wait a moment.
Go.
Eat, Mr.Amir.
Eat dear. Eat my sweetie.
Mom.
Salam, beautiful girl!
Why don't you come in?
- Did you have lunch?
- No, I don't eat.
Wont you tell your aunt your name?
First one who tells her name, wins.
Atefeh!
My name is Aida.
Mommy, let's go there.
Where dear?
The amusement park, there are lots of toys.
Thank you, so much.
If dear Atefeh becomes the best
student at her Tehran school,
I'll take her to the amusement park.
Mommy! I'm hungry.
When do we dine?
Dear Atefeh, let's eat this until dinner is ready.
This little one is for Mr.Amir. Eat this dear.
It's cold here, and you
don't take care of yourself.
Thank you so much.
How could you knit this with all your tasks!
Mr.Seyyed, your jacket is old too.
InshAllah, in the next days,
if I have time I'll get some...
What happened!
Nothing, I told you sometimes I can't see well.
Let me see your hand.
It's nothing. No need to see.
You do your work, I take care of it.
Dear, Atefeh, sweetie,
come here pick up this tablecloth.
Dear Atefeh. Hurry up, it's late!
My button is broken.
It's not broken sweetie,
you're concentrating on the TV.
Mr.Seyyed, It's very cold today,
don't forget your scarf.
Go sweetie. Go,go.
MashAllah, Mr.Seyyed.
Now you're a Tehrani student of religious sciences.
No need to write letter!
Tell me what you need.
Go inside!
Ms.Azam, I'll take her with me.
She burdens you, sister.
Certainly not. She helps me.
Do you need something?
If you find half kilo of vegetables,
buy for me please.
Sure, sure.
Apologies to your great ancestor (the Prophet)
If you drop the turban,
I might get to find a customer.
Can't you forget about business,
even just for two hours?
So we get to be on time for our first class.
How do you say this,
with your gnosis!
"A halal (lawful) income 
is like a Jihad (Spiritual War)".
InshAllah you studied 
to Makateb book by Sheikh Ansari!
Allah akbar! (God is great).
This is for your hlal income.
Thank God, through these discussions of ours
..you've grasped the business lessons alright.
You are so right!
It's like God has designed
me for trucking
but my dear father likes to see me
in Rowhani clothes.
Since I'm kind, I can't break his heart.
I'm not supposed to become a great 
priest, expedient in all affairs.
For my city, the basic level is enough
to answer their questions.
Stop the truck! Driver! Stop!
- Alhamdulillah, I get my income.
- Stop! I charter it.
Mr.Seyyed Reza.
- Salamun alaikom Mr.Hadj.
- Aleikom assalam.
It seems you forgot my notice.
Mr.Hadj, what words. There was a problem.
Anyway, today's session is over.
InshAllah the next session.
No rush Mr.Hamid. InshAllah next session...
Seyyed, that man was human too.
He didn't know the address. We saw that...
God wouldn't like it, if 
we leave him like that.
Mr.Seyyed! The first session is all about
prefaces, MashAllah you know them well.
Salamun alaikom!
Salamun alaikom,
Hadj Hadi Dorchei. Join us!
Seyyed! He is the student who married 
a jeweler's doughter, remember ?
Spearmint flower...
Father is gone, and I'm alone.
My flower.
Your crying made me impatient.
Mr.Seyyed.
I don't know why my foot got numb suddenly.
Please bring a glass of water for Atefeh.
I'm sorry, I don't know why
I suddenly become like this.
You're tired. Take some rest, you'll be fine.
Here, dear Atefeh. Drink sweetie.
Atefeh also fell asleep. You know, Mr.Seyyed:
Dear Atefeh becomes like me,
she wakes up thirsty in the night.
Zehra Sadat, are you fine?
No, I'm fine, fine.
I become like my grandmother, God bless her.
My feed have no strength, I can't move them.
I'm going to sleep, tomorrow I'll be fine.
Mr.! Where is your friend?
Take this car away!
If the ambulance comes, I'm responsible!
Let us carry the patient.
Take the car over there.
But this car is like an ambulance, 
we bring a patient.
It's no ambulance at all!
I'm responsible, move it.
Fine, you go in. I move the car.
Where should I park it?
There by the booth.
- Are you better?
- Not yet it hurts.
Calm down, you'll be alright.
Salamun alaikom.
What happened?
Doctor, since some days she's been
seeing double and her fingers get numbed.
She works a lot,
tonight her foot weakened.
I guess it's because of overworking.
How long have you been like this?
Since... few months ago.
She says few months,
you say few days.
- She has insurance?
- Yes.
Look here.
Ms.Nurse!
Are your legs numb too?
Yes, Mr.doctor.
Which part of them?
All of them.
Do you sense here?
No.
How about here?
No, Mr.Doctor.
Here?
There, a little.
- You have double vision too?
- Mr.Doctor!
God gives you patience.
- Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim...
- This leg also?
- Yes.
- Al-Rahman al-rahim, maliki yawm al-d√Æn...
Selamun alaikom!
No one here?
Mr.Seyyed.
For your ancestor's sake, take me home.
It's not important,
I swear to God.
I'll be fine tomorrow morning.
Here it is scary.
Salamun alaikom.
You have an examination order?
Yes, here you go.
So you've been examined, don't you have pain?
No Mr.Doctor. May I go home?
So, why have you come?
You should wait until morning,
see the results and visit a specialist.
I told them to give her a sedative to rest
You better stay, in case she needs some...
If possible, I go home: our children are alone.
You know better.
Just come back soon,
she may need something.
Ms.Nurse. I'll be in my office,
if anything happens.
OK, Mr.doctor.
Azan (the call to preayers)
Get up, it's morning!
Get up! How
longer will you sleep?
Get up! Get up!
Where is aunt Zahra?
Don't watch TV. Let's go!
Where is your mother's Salat veil?
In that room's closet.
You're still watching TV.
Go to school already! It's late.
Go,go,go.
You bring your books?
Yes, yes.
Master (Atefeh)! You're still watching TV!
Sit dear, sit.
Sweetie, you used to be obedient!
Hurry up! Hurry!
Go inside, you don't have school today.
Go sweetie.
- Salamun alaikom, Ms.Hadj.
- Wa alaikom assalam.
Have you given them breakfast?
I was busy really...
God, don't let a home be without a woman.
Dear, put this in your backpack.
You have not closed your coat properly!
Aunt Zahra takes me to school.
Not today. After she comes
back home, she will.
Mr.Seyyed, go and bring your wife home today.
Don't keep her in the hospital.
Certainly, Ms.Hadj.
Just they don't allow babies
into the hospital, please do me a favor...
What are you saying, Mr.Seyyed!
I can't take care of him with my knee pains.
My knees don't hurt.
Excuse me.
Ya Allah!
- Selam.
- Selamun alaikom, forgive me.
She just fell asleep.
Poor girl, she was crying a lot.
She misses her children.
Are you her husband?
Yes. God heals you, inshAllah.
Thank you so much.
Salam alaikom.
Alhamdulillah, you are better?
Thanks to God.
- Mr.Seyyed?
- My dear.
Take me home.
The poor children are alone.
Sure, let me see what
the doctor says, alright.
What are you doing here?
Salamun Alaikom.
I asked you what are you doing here.
This is the women's section. Please go out.
Mr.Seyyed is my husband!
Your husband, not the other patients' husband.
Please go out.
You may only see her during visiting hours.
Please forgive me.
Sorry for the trouble.
We came to Emergencies last night.
They didn't say what the problem is.
We even took the tests.
But they said a specialist
should see the results.
You're too shy to look at me, but you're good
at hanging at the ladies' section.
I didn't notice, you're right.
I apologized already.
Your wife's doctor is Ms.Doctor Yousefian, there.
She checked your wife this morning, 
you may ask her.
Nursing students, take note!
This kind of patients requires special care. 
- Salamun alaikom.
- Salam alaikom.
Excuse me, I am Ms.Moeini's husband.
Ms.Moeini?
- Zahra Sadat Moeini.
- Which room?
403, they said you visited her.
Ah, the young lady suspected with 
MS unfortunately, is your wife?
M... MS?
One patient suspected with MS.
It should be interesting for you,
let's check on her.
MS is more common among women.
Especially young women.
Each disease presents its own profile.
What does it mean?
It means the symptoms and disease continuance
may not resemble those of other cases.
Apparently, this patient suffers of
double vision since few months ago.
Then she suffered numbness
on her fingertips and hands.
Numbness on the legs' muscles.
But the patient and her family 
didn't take it seriously
They thought she was tired.
But it was a first attack, a mild attack.
Until last night another episode presented.
The main symptoms are clear: balance disorders
weakness of the limbs, visual disturbances.
But the final diagnosis is based on a spnial MRI.
- Excus me, MS.Doctor.
- Yes, dear?
The things you said about Zahra Sadat,
what do they mean?
Your wife is suspected with MS.
Of course, she should take an MRI to confirm.
Yes.
I really have no medical knowledge, what's MS?
MS is a neurological disorder that may lead
to the paralysis of the patient.
Of course, it's not a definitive diagnosis.
You are our guests for some days now.
InshaAllah it doesn't turn out to be serious.
Prepare x-rays for room 402 please,
and inject a painkiller for that lady.
Take good care of her, she is friends
with doctor Salehi.
Sure,Ms.Doctor.
What's your occupation?
I study religious sciences.
An akhund (mullah)?
No, I said a student of
religious sciences. I study.
What's the difference?
You'll become an akhund(mullah).
Excuse me, the doctor said 
Zahra Sadat will be paralyzed?
What will be of us?
Of Amir Ali?
- Amir Ali, your kid?
- Ms.Nurse!
Ms.Zahra where are you going?
Why are you walking, Zahra Sadat!
For your ancestor's sake, take me home.
Let me die in my own home, don't leave me here.
- Fine, fine.
- Go over there!
Ms.Gholizadeh, take her gently.
Mr.Seyyed, for God's sake!
Take me home!
Don't leave here. Mr.Seyed!
Let me die in my own home!
Zahra Sadat, calm down! Lay her on the bed.
- Selamun alaikom, Seyyed.
- We aleikom assalam.
She is better, inshAllah?
Thanks to God! Pray Mr.Hamid!
Hadj Reza, the only things I can do well,
are praying and bringing food.
God gives them patience.
- Mr.Khadem Nishaburi, to the women's section.
Seyyed! They're calling you, you're famous!
Mr.Hadj, is she your only one (wife)?
No, I also have two children.
What did you do to the poor girl
to make her sick like this?
What?
Find these drugs at the pharmacy
outside the hospital.
Excuse me, is it possible to 
see her some minutes?
They took her to the MRI.
The poor girl has been sick for some months.
God knows where your mind was.
- Sorry, Mr.Hamid.
- We go?
The drugs are so expensive!
Seyyed, when will you drop
these ta'arof (etiquettes)?
You're killing me!
It's been slow, but alhamdulillah
yesterday was a good business day.
Here you go.
Thanks!
Here you are.
If that's all, I'll be waiting downstairs.
Mr.Hadj.
Come, take this food for her yourself.
Just don't take so long, it's the patients' resting time.
God bless you.
Don't forget: "Ya Allah"!
I talked to your doctor...
She said you'll be discharged after two days.
Of course, it's not bad.
You don't rest at home.
In this way, you have to rest.
Now have some of this, dear,
to get some energy, as Ms.Azam says.
Zahra Sadat... for God's sake, don't cry.
Nothing is wrong.
You just became weak, you'll be fine.
For your dead father's sake, Mr.Seyyed.
For my ancestor, Fatimah Zahra's (a), sake.
Tell me the truth, Mr.Seyyed,
you have never lied to me.
Am I becoming paralyzed?
La ilaha illa Allah..(There is an only one God)
If my disease is incurable, tell me.
Let me hear it from you.
What will be of my children?
My dear Atefeh?
Fine, fine.
Ok, good bye.
Excuse me, Ms.
It's Sepideh.
Ms.Sepideh, we have bothered you
a lot today. God rewards you.
We've been married for 8 years with Zahra Sadat.
She must have been so young.
Each smaller city... has its own traditions:
In these 8 years, I had never left her alone.
She can't bear not seeing her children.
You are a lady yourself. 
You must be a mother too.
You understand these things better.
Please be a sister for her.
I'll appreciate it.
What a kid!
Hurry, fast.
Ms.Atefeh, don't you have 
homework to be watcing TV?
I finished!
It burns.
What?
It burns.
What burns?
Reduce the oven flame!
Dad I'm hungry!
I'm cooking ash potage for you, dear.
Where is mommy?
Mommy is sick, and has to sleep 
some days in the hospital to get better.
She said dear Atefe should take care
of daddy and Mr.Amir Ali these days.
Mommy says that soup is for sick people,
and that kids must eat spaghetti.
Yes, but eat this ash I'm cooking,
you will understand...
Amir Ali doesn't like ash either,
he likes spaghetti.
Now Ms.Atefeh is teasing, so we have a problem.
Amir Ali needs his diaper changed.
It burns.
I reduced the flame!
My chest burns.
My Amir Ali, did you stain your diaper?
What do we do now, Master?
- We change it.
- Where are you going?
Mommy Zahra says when changing
his diaper, I shouldn't look.
Yes Mr, yes.
Lets take his pants out.
Don't open his diaper!
Go and wash him in the bathroom.
Master, don't leave your father alone!
- I want to do my homework.
- You said you finished it.
- I want to do it again.
- I help you.
My dear Amir Ali, well done, he got clean.
Look! Learn, learn Ms.Atefeh
is doing her homework.
I finished doing it!
Good, dear Amir Ali, now I get you a diaper..
Eh, eh! What are you doing!?
He has urinated, he got you wet.
You should change your clothes.
It burnt!
The food burnt.
Salamun alaikom Ms.Hadj.
Come in please, come in.
It's nice of you, but we have food.
I know, its smell fills the air!
Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim.
- Come Master, come, God brings you food.
- I don't like Ms.Azam's food.
Be thankful, don't upset God.
It's not good.
Now you upset me. Come!
Have your food. And turn the TV off.
Turn off the Tv and come here!
Turn it off! Come and have your food.
For a few days your mother is away.
Instead of helping me...
... you turn into a bad kid. Eat!
It's hot.
Eat, my dear, eat to get fat. Eat.
A little.
Good dear.
Now he's not hungry. Now...Amir Ali is full.
Dad eats some...
Eat dear. It's not hot now. Eat.
What are you saying? I don't understand. Master!
Come and see what your brother is saying.
He wants "nai nai nai".
What's "nai nai"?
When you were not here,
mommy Zahra pulled the curtain
and did nai nai nai for us.
Thanks her a lot:
the last thing I need is doing nai nai nai for you.
What's wrong? It's very good.
Don't talk! Go to your room and sleep.
Come dear, come.
What's the matter, Master?
Do you want water?
No, I want my mommy Zahra.
Mommy Zahra should stay at
the hospital for two days to get better.
Daddy's sweetie should be a good girl...
and take care of Mr.Amir Ali and his father.
And don't forget about praying before sleep.
What prayer?
You should pray God heals your mum,
so she comes to us sooner.
Is God awake now?
God... God is always awake.
Sleep dear.
Hospital costs...
of Zahra Sadat...
Medication and treatment costs..
Daily costs at home.
- Salamun alaikom, Ms.Aida.
- Salam.
- Where is your grandmother?
- she has leg pains.
Salam alaikom Ms.Hadj.
Are you fine inshAllah?
I didn't sleep last night because of foot pain.
God heals you. I'll take Atefeh to school..
I have an appointment at the hospital. I wonder
how I made it to the hospital three months back.
InshAllah God heals all ailing ones.
- Hurry dear Atefeh, it's getting late.
- I'm coming!
I'm grown up, I can go to school by myself.
You may get lost, dear.
Wasn't your mum taking you?
I don't get lost. I know the way.
No need to come with me.
Where are you going dear!
Don't run, you may fall!
- Salamun alaikom Mr.Hadj.
- Salamun alaikom.
Salamun alaikom, excuse me.
Where is Mr.Hadj Rahim's class?
- That side of school.
- Thank you.
But I think Hadj Rahim's lessons
are a bit difficult for your son.
- Shouldn't you first stop to gather knowledge...
- Mr.Hadj!
... and then start using it!
If you become heavy, you can no longer walk.
But if you give your heart to God's Word,
you'll see how God shows the way.
A kid was falling from a roof,
no one could do anything.
One simple rural old man who was there,
raised his head to the sky and said:
"God, please save him by Yourself."
The kid stopped in the middle of the air...
People surrounded him and asked:
"Who are you?"
And "what miracle or power is it?"
The old man was shocked.
He said: "Isn't it normal?"
To whatever God told me, I said "alright".
And whatever I tell God, God doesn't say "no".
He was just a simple rural man.
With no studies of philosophy.
No knowledge of esoterism,
nor a dervish of extreme austerity.
He just had done honestly everything he knew.
Storing knowledge on knowledge,
blackness on blackness
but if there's no action, what's the use?
Instead of accumulating, act more!
Salam alaikom Mr.Hadj.
Salamun alaikom wa rahmatullah.
Isn't it better leaving this 
motherly job to a lady?
Dear Mr., you have more important work to do.
You don't respect these clothes. 
For God's sake respect this school.
Curse on Shaytan.
After death...
... first they (angels) count what you have
and then they count what you lack.
Couldn't you give me a break today?
He was just getting to the good part.
You totally ruin my dignity dear.
What was the rush?
Mr.Hamid...
You knew someone in the carpet market.
- Are you still in touch?
- InshAllah you mean well?
I want to pre-sale the carpet.
Is the mother of Amir Ali, poor woman,
busy with medical treatments?
Or you want to weave like in old times?
We have to make do.
Best is what has happened. But Mr.Seyyed...
There are lots of jobs 
for a good student like you.
Why don't you preach? I can arrange it...
There's plenty of time for those jons.
For now, just find me a customer.
Unfortunately, Mr.Hadj,
my first guest was correct.
The MRI results, and other tests' results
confirm your wife has MS.
The illness started very slowly,
but is now in progress.
This illness is unknown:
there's no definitive cure for MS.
For now, we can stop progress of the illness.
She is going to be our guest for a few days,
then you can take her home.
And you may give her drugs by yourself.
Don't forget praying too.
I go to Dr.Abdi's office, 
if you need me, just call.
Alright, Ms.doctor.
Mr.Hadj, these clothes suit you.
Why don't you wear them all the time?
Sometimes it's very lucrative.
You may see her for a minute if you want.
- May it be accepted.
- May God accept it.
I wish you had brought our children.
It truly is forbidden.
They barely let me come here.
They say I can meet you
only during visiting hours.
In visiting hours they don't allow children in.
Did you talk to the doctor?
What's the problem with me?
Yes, I talked to the doctor.
She said... that....
Mr.Seyyed, for God's sake, tell me the truth.
Zahra Sadat, have I ever lied to you?
Your doctor said you will 
be discharged in two days.
There's only one condition:
The doctor said when you go back home,
you should do "nai nai nai" for kids.
I may also...
Oh, God kill me, you're teasing me.
You want to kill me by shame, not nice.
AstaghfirAllah, there's no shame 
if a person does "nai nai" for kids.
Don't tease me Mr.Seyyed.
Come to Tehran dear sister, come.
You are both ladies, 
you understand each other well.
I can't do some stuff.
Zahra Sadat doesn't have anyone here either.
Whe the end of the month?
God keep you safe.. 
No.
If you can leave your children 
with Mr.Ahmad's mother it's alright.
Dear Amir Ali sleep, sleep.
I cook you a very delicious food.
Sleep, sleep. Bravo, Amir Ali.
Mommy's sweetie, sleep...
- Salam.
- Salam alaikom, Ms.Aida!
Stand up, look who's here.
Come in, sweetie.
Esta√∞firullah..

Bravo, sweetie. Well done. 
How well you recite the Quran!
Who has taught you? Miss Azam taught you?
No, aunt Zahra taught me.
My dear, I get him, I get him.
My dear, my sweetie.
He cries because he wants "nai nai".
Master, pull the curtains.
Yay!

She is awake!
Is Zahra Sadat fine?
Look who has come.
My life! My life! My sweetie!
Now smile, here you are: 
your beautiful children.
Amir Ali has come!
Mr.Seyyed Reza brought a bouquet.
Ya Allah. Salam alaikom.
Are you better inshAllah?
I'm better.
Thanks for coming.
InshAllah, illness will soon leave
and you'll come home.
Have some cookies, please.
Ya Allah! Ya Allah!
With your permission, I enter.
That's why they say a second wife
is the greatest obligatin.
I can't handle even one wife.
Fine. Groom yourself, we have guest.
Not bad.
Not outstanding either. Are you a begginer?
No way, he and his father are
in the carpet business for many years.
Mostly his family weave carpets.
But Seyyed weaved this one.
The bazaar is down.
It's hard to sell. If you finish it
by year's end(Spring), I can arrange it.
No, Mr.Hadj new year...
Trust in God, I'll finish it.
Then we have a deal!
Here you are, the pre-payment.
Excellent, be blessed Mr.Hadj,
inshAllah you get a cozy place in Heaven.
If you need anything, tell Mr.Hamid.
He brings it for you from me.
Appreciated, Mr.Hadj.
At your service.
First blow on it, then eat it.
- Goodbye.
- God keep you safe.
- Master, shall we go out for dinner?
- Yay! Pizza, pizza, pizza.
Ready? Pull, pull, pull.
Ready?
On your marks... eat!
Seyyed, did you tell his mother
to find me a good girl?
Of course not! I see from your
graceful smile I can't rely on you!
Don't worry, I told her!
You did?
She spoke to them, they need 
time to think about it.
That's the source of my problems,
due to their thinking.
They think, and say "no."
Trust God, for now eat your food.
Eh, I talked so I ate less.
Kids! Give me some of your pizza...
Yay! Mommy. Mommy comes.
Master, where are you? Mum has come!
Dear Atefeh, come here to mommy!
Zahra Sadat, look! Amir Ali look!
Amir Ali, did you see mommy came? Look!
Wheat flower...
I will make a cradle for you¬Ö
Zahra Sadat, why didn't you call me?
I'd help you.
Thanks so much. I can do it myself.
Dear Zahra, come and sit.
I bring you a cup of tea.
When I was away, you worked so hard.
What's with this ta'arof (extra politeness).
A prescription from the doctor?
I had missed your singing lullaby.
From tomorrow, you can go for your studies.
These days you were busy with hospital issues.
Mr.Hadj Rahim is sick.
For now, my studies will be at home, by your side.
If you get tired of me, you may kick me out.
Your carpet weaving has improved a lot.
Mr.Seyyed, did you see that dear Atefeh...
She's just a kid, Zahra Sadat.
She saw her mother in a wheelchair,
and she was shocked. She'll get used to it.
Now drink your tea, and I bring your piles.
Tomorrow I'll get your ampoules.
The doctor said:
Injecting your ampoule for two weeks,
you'll be very well.
As Mr.Hamid always says: for now you...
Master, you know the way to school?
No, come!
Master! Such tricks you play.
Whenever I am attired,
you run from me like the wind.
But if I wear clothes like now,
you hold me tightly. Tell me, sweetie.
Zahra Sadat!
Zahra Sadat!
What are you doing, Zahra Sadat?
It costs 12 tomans for monthly consumption.
11 with insurance.
I'll have it,plaese.
Excuse me, would you give me those
walking sticks high up to the elbow.
onlardan istiyorum.
One?
No, two of them.
Excuse me, could you please 
give me one of those brushes.
Which color?
That pink one.
Where are you Zahra Sadat?
Oh descendant of the Prophet,
what are you doing to yourself?
Why are you walking?
Aren't you supposed to rest?
I want to cook spaghetti for my kid.
Atefeh gets hungry back from school.
Watch out with the dishes!
I told Mr.Seyyed to buy vegetables.
I'll make ash for you.
My child doesn't like ash, she likes spaghetti.
What is spaghetti? Wait a moment, good girl.
Leave me alone.
You are sick! Go and rest!
Why do you insist, dear!
Leave me alone.
Go and rest, dear!
I cook spaghetti for you myself, really.
Get up, my dear, it's alright. Get up.
No problem, I clean everything myself.
Why do this to yourself?
I cook everything you want.
Go to your room already.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Don't you have foot pain?
Go to your home!
Leave, and let me die in my misery.
Why do you stare?
Take your grandmather's hand 
and go home! Fast!
Go to the room. Where were you,
Mr.Seyyed? Look what she's doing.
I can't handle her. Come do 
something about it.
(Arabic) There is an only One God.
- What happened?
- Don't touch me!
- Zahra...
- By God, if you touch me, I kill myself!
Mr.Seyyed, do you see she's gone mad?
Please excuse us, I will talk to her.
Thank you sweetie, go please.
You've been helpful.
Ms.Azam please forgive us, I'm so sorry.
Zahra Sadat...
I think Ms.Azam is right, you've gone mad.
You love your daddy?
Why did you mess up the kitchen?
You want to give me more work?
Now tell me: what happened?
What else do you want to happen?
Is there more degradation than this? Than you
telling me you should clean up my kitchen?
Don't you see I am becoming paralyzed?
My hands are weak, my legs aren't mine.
I can't cook food for my children,
not even a smiple spaghetti.
Dear Zahra, everyone becomes ill.
We are all human beings.
If you rest and eat your drugs.
Turst in God you'll be fine soon.
Do you think I'm a kid?
You want to fool me?
Don't you think that I understand you pity me?
I become a lump of meat.
God, why don't you just kill me?
Peace on Fatemeh Zahra...
Don't make me despicable.
Let me die with honor.
Zahra Sadat, why speak absurdly?
God will be angered.
Don't be unthankful, think about our life.
Take me to a hospice.
Take me back to Nishabur. I'm tired.
I can't tolerate this house, I'm tired.
You are tired? I am tired!
You think I'm having a blast?
See this book? It's not
been opened in a month.
I spend my days cooking and washing 
the kids' clothes. And you just whine!
I came here to study, but 
I spend my life like this!
You want to go to Nishabur? I take you.
Tomorrow! I take you and leave you there.
Take a room and study religious 
sciences, like all normal students!
Give our children to my mum and sister,
is that good! You want this!?
Me too! You want this!?
What are you doing Mr.Seyyed?
Send regards to the Prophet!
(In Turkish) You effect all of us... 
I'm so sorry Mr.Seyyed, forgive me.
Don't say that, you should forgive me.
I became your wife to be at the
service of a child of the Prophet..
Instead I become a burden for you.
Being a descendant of the Prophet takes merit.
For many years you took care of me.
Let me be at your service. Then
I can be aware of what goes on around me.
You never yelled at me before...
Your voice is...
God wont forgive my faults, 
if I yell at you again.
Surely you did too.. (voice)
Please don't remind me, I lost control.
Forget about me: poor Ms.Azam,
you nearly gave her a heart attack.
God kill me, I did not respect her.
I should make it up for her somehow.
Here is a peace offering.
It's so beautiful Mr.Seyyad.
You had good taste all along?
It's beautiful on your head!
Here two crutches.
They're very comfortable,
soon you'll get used to them.
I got your ampoules. We should go to a clinic.
- Here you are.
- Beautiful color, for Atefeh's hair...
I got it for you.
I love seeing you comb your hair in front of me.
Seyyed, could you please call Atefeh?
You need her?
I want to go to the rest room.
Put your hand on my shoulder,
I'll take you myselft.
What's the matter Zahra Sadat?
You start again?
Didn't we agree...
I'm so embarrassed Mr.Seyyed...
I can't control myself...
I think this carpet has become dirty.
Needed to wash.
Excuse me, Mr.Hadj...
- Truly, I've ran out of money...
- These days, nobody has enough money.
Had you finished the carpet,
I could work something out.
But not in your situation.
I paid a pre-payment a month ago,
but I still don't know...
...when you'll finish it.
What are you saying Mr.Hadj?
It's not new year yet.
I'll finish sooner.
How about the 1st of next month?
- No, the 1st of next month...
- You don't worry.
- I'll finish and bring it on the 1st day.
- That's something.
This way is best for you.
You may get your money sooner.
Thank God, you earn money by working.
It's your right.
But Momeen (faithful), I aint good
enough to help you with money?
- A (Hafez) fortune card Mr.?
- Sure, lets see...
Here you go.
Wait sweetie, wait.
There you go.
- Salam.
- Alaikom salam.
What are you doing, good kid?
For aunt Zahra: I pray
for everything to be alright.
So she wont die.
Pray, your prayer will likely be accepted.
(Supplication of Kumail in Arabic)
My God and Lord, have I any but Thee?
From whom to ask removal of my affliction
and regard for my affairs!
My God and Lord! Have I any but Thee?
From whom to ask removal of my affliction
And regard for my affairs!
My God and Lord! Have I any but Thee?
From whom to ask removal of my affliction
And regard for my affairs!
My God and Lord! Have I any but Thee?
From whom to ask removal of my affliction
And regard for my affairs!
My God..! Lord..!
I come take you home in two hours.
Ms.Hadj, take care of them.
No worries Mr.Seyyed.
I take care of your wife and child.
- Bless you.
- You get some fresh air.
Mr.Seyyed, don't go back to weave.
- No worries, I might go to school to...
- Give me the child.
... better see Mr.Hadj Rahim.
I'll come for you.
Who is it?
- Salam alaikom Mr.Hadj.
- Salam alaikom Ms.
- You didn't forget me?
- What are you saying, lady!
We owe you, you helped us a lot.
With your permission.
Where did you go Mr.Hadj?
The children aren't home, they went near.
Then Zahra Sadat is better, thank God.
Yes, alhamdulillah.
How beautiful. Zahra Sadat weaved it?
Yes. I mean, the two of us.
How good that you work together.
This is your living room?
What a cute desk!
If she's out, it means she's so much better.
Sometimes she cooks too.
- You clearly took good care of her.
- Alhamdulillah, she's fine.
Using crutches though..
Those are beds...
You love her, don't you?
So you love her.
Good for her. Sometimes say that to her.
The shrine of Imam Reza?
Yes.
Beautiful.
You have a small home...
... but it has a good atmosphere.
It reminds me my childhood!
This book is about MS,
Zahra Sadat's illness.
I think it may be helpful.
Thanks so much. It's nice of you.
My heart was aching a lot.
I thought by visiting you maybe I'd feel beter.
Is that silly?
At the hospital... I talked 
with Zahra Sadat once or twice.
She speaks words straight into the heart.
They don't come. I should get going.
Give her my regard. Kiss her on my behalf.
Have you ever...?
There is happiness in 
appreciating the small things.
Zahra Sadat told me so.
I got a day off to go to the (divorce) court.
After five years (of marriage).
I didn't go.
She loves you a lot. Take care of her.
Tell her I thought a lot about her words.
She is right.
I'm going for your shoes.
Well done, my dear.
What a good smell there is!
So Master, tell me : you had a good time?
Did you pray for me?
Dear Atefeh...
Don't you have homework to be watching TV?
Mr.Seyyed.
MashAllah, you're weaving much better than me.
You are being humble!
Today in the "Aname" (Quran chapter) session,
I saw a girl from our neighborhood.
She lost her husband in an accident.
She didn't have any child.
In my opinion, she seems a nice girl.
If you want to find a girl for Mr.Hamid,
his mind is somewhere else...
We are human beings,
no one's tomorrow is for granted.
God wouldn't like to see our kids without a mother.
No need to worry about me, I think about it.
I had wanted to talk with you about it.
Thank God you bring it up.
I'm considering someone, a respectful lady.
Her appearance is not bad.
I can say, she is gorgeous.
Of course, she can't fill your place.
But we are only humans.
Zahra Sadat, you want to kill me?
Let me die first, then think about your fun!
What fun?
- You brought it up.
- I said something. But why you get so excited?
Zahra Sadat...
You would leave Mr.Seyyed alone?
You who's never been unkind.
While you were out...
... your nurse has come.
God bless her. She was worried about you.
She brought this book.
Now tell me, what are those papers in your hand?
Mr.Amir Ali's vaccination card.
He needs to get his two-year-old vaccine.
It shouldn't be late.
This is the prescription for your eyes.
Same as the previous one.
I got you an appointment for next month,
take this when you go.
You don't think about your health.
I fear that you'll get sick eventually.
- Mr.Seyyed?
- Yes,my dear.
My children need a mother.
You can't.. study in such conditions.
Just... for God's sake may her not be so beautiful.
Otherwise I'll die from sorrow.
- What time is it?
- 8:30 AM
Atefeh's school!
Ms.Azam was on her way out and took her along.
Give me your hand.
- What?
- Your hand.
It's not important.
When I was working in the workshop...
... in the new year's eve...
...or when we were in a rush...
... we would cut our hand,
and put salt on it until morning.
My grandmother taught me.
It burned, it burned a lot.
But we worked until morning.
In the name of God,
the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Not bad!
Not very striking either.
So, when will you start the next one?
With your permission,
I don't want to work for a while.
I leave it to God.
Seyyed, what's the matter?
If you're worried about money, it's no problem.
I'll pay for this one, and 
pre-pay the next one too.
- Excellent, thanks! I think there's no...
- It's not about money Mr.Hadj.
Then? Did I delay paying you?
Or you found another customer?
Mr.Seyyed!
Many pretend they'll work with you,
but leave you alone in the middle.
Especially in this bazaar.
The factories weaving carpets
are a pest for handmade ones.
But we can agree on a good price.
I can't let the child of the Prophet
be disatisfied with me.
Don't rush either.
I don't know why there's days when business fades.
It's like no one's in the mood for moving furniture.
- What's up in school?
- Sheikh Kazem was asking about you!
He said: "Our Seyyad isn't so passionate
to study as he seemed at first sight."
I said: "true".
The kids are unhappy.
Their mother used to take them outdoors.
Mr.Hamid, if this Friday is sunny,
let's go to some mountain or plain.
Awesome, it doesn't get better than this!
- Mr.Hamid, is this size right?
- No!
- Too tick! They'll stay raw at the core.
- Fine, don't take it so hard.
Mr.Seyyed, last night, we talked to them.
- Nice! Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Our half is done, and the other half,
they should think about it.
- Congratulations.
All my problems are becouse of this thinking...
Uncle, throw the ball!
Fine, now I teach you how to play ball.
- Yay! Go uncle!
- I stay here at the center. You go there.
Just don't hit me heardly, it hurts!
Aida, shoot hard!
Seyyed! Get up and help me here, I'm all alone.
- Good job, daddy!
- You, come in the middle.
- Don't hit my head!
I get shortness of breath.
- I get old, Zahra Sadat.
- God made Imam Ali old.
What a good smell! You like it too?
How could I not like it?
You bought it for me.
I just don't want to use it up so soon.
It's been a while since you last
read Quran for me. Can you read please?
Sure.
"In the name of God, 
the Compassionate, the Merciful"
"Did we not relieve for you your chest."(94:1)
"And taken off from you your burden."(94:2)
"Which pressed heavily upon your back."(94:3)
"And exalted for you your esteem?"(94:4)
"Surely with difficulty comes ease."(94:5)
"Certainly with difficulty comes ease."(94:6)
"So when you are free, 
carry on with your labour."(94:7)
"And direct your longing towards your Lord."(94:8)
Why you look at me like that?
I love you.
I love you so much.
For a long time everyone has been looking
for a key to heaven, a treasure or elixir.
They are searching for the secret of
happiness in the wrong place.
It's obvious that it's not there.
They imagine it a treasure,
and due to this illusion they miss it.
The whole story can be summed up 
in one word: call it "key" or "code".
But it is not complicated at all.
The Great God told Moses(s) this code in one world:
(to the student) Alaikom assalam.
"Love for My sake, hate for My sake."
When saying that the code of
acceptance of all works is Wilayat.
It means that this loving is for God's sake.
It means whoever God loves, you love them too.
It means loving becouse of God, 
growing affection for God's sake.
Not for superficial beauties,
not even for your own heart. Just for God!
If the criterion for affection is God,
Even if nobady appreciates you, you keep loving.
If you face ingratitude, 
you keep doing the right thing.
Those who can't continue to the end,
they don't work for God!
The more hardships you take for God,
the higher your spiritual rank.
"From the alchemy of love for Thee,
my dusty face became glittering gold."
"Yes; by the happiness of Thy grace,
dust ought be gold." (Hafez Shirazi)
This alchemy all people look for, is Love.
The rest are crumbs. 
Now dear, you see why they say:
"Wash away your books, 
if you study what we study"
Because the lesson of Love, is not in any book!
