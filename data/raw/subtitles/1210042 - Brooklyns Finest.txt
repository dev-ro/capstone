Brooklyns Finest
Lifes not a matter a right and wrong.
Its a matter a righter and wronger.
Righter and wronger?
Those are not words, Carlo.
Hey, thats what the judge said.
Judge said that in the, in a court
a law. He said righter and wronger, right there.
Pledge allegiance, all that bullshit.
And what else the judge say?
Uh, he said, that people would
You know, protect their lives no matter
what. I mean, he didnt say it like that.
You know, he said it in like the fancy
legal shit. But, but, yeach.
He said people will protect their lives
no matter what. Somethin like that.
You heard about what happened, right? On
the Belt Parkway, you heard that.
- Yeach, I was on the Belt Parkway, like,
Sixty-fifth Street and-.
- You were on the Belt Parkway?
Yeach, down by that pier.
And, you know, fuckin cops pull
me over, right?
They give me the breath test.
You know, Im drunk off my ass.
And they lock me up, right? So, before
I go in front of the judge
My lawyer, he says to me...
He says, you know, you were so drunk, that,
uh
That its considered a felony. Well,
which means I broke parole.
Well, thats seven years.
I mean, no lie, Sal. I, I was, I felt like
I was gonna shit a bowlin ball.
So I finally go in front a the
judge.
He goes, um, can you please explain what
happened?
And I said, your Honor, look, Im
in a bar, Im havin a drink. Right?
These two fuckin guys come in, they,
they assaulted me. They bashed me with
You know, smashed bottles over my head.
Yeach, theres bottles over my head
And, kicked me in the face. And to,
to save myself, I, I got in my car.
Uh, I, you know, I ran outta there,
I got in my car and, I, you know, I drove off.
Right, and he bought that?
You know, he bought nothin.
- Thats a true story. I got no-.
- Aw, come on.
-Thats
a true story. I got no-. Okay.
All right.
Okay.
You know, I owed all these bookies, and,
um, back then I didnt have nothin to pay em with, so
So somebody, you know, in the bar called
the cops.
But the judge, hes listenin to this.
And hes, you know, he looks like hes
gonna shit a bowlin ball.
He says that this is not a, a simple case
a right and wrong
But righter and wronger.
Because the defendant had to break the
law
To protect his own life.
Its unfuckin believable.
What happened to the cops? Nothin. They
were right, even though they were wrong.
And I was wrong, only because that I was
right.
You see? You get that now?
- You get that, right?
- Yeach, yeach. And I was wrong, only because that I was right.
Youre too much.
You see what Im sa-
Yo, Tango? You got that shit on deck?
Still very active here at the BK Projects.
Details are sketchy but heres what we know.
A young African-American man named Alan
Daniels
Was allegedly shot and killed by
police.
Were hearing it was one police officer
who was trying to rob him.
- Hes a good boy.
- Its gon- its gon- its gonna be
okay. All right?
Hes a good boy.
Residents here are obviously outraged.
My boy. My baby.
-Its gon- its gon-
its gonna be okay. All right?
- Hot out this mo-fo. Police everywhere.
- All right, man. Hurry up, hurry up.
It looks crazy right now. What happened, yo?
- Tango.
- Man-Man. Let me holler at you real
quick.
Thought you were going back to school,
B?
Come on, Tango. What they goin teach
me in there I aint already learnin out here, man?
But you gonna make that court date,
right?
- Come on, Tang, you know Im gonna make
the court date, you know Im gonna make the court date.
- All right, cool.
Whats goin on here, fam?
- Tango.
Check it, I dont wanna hear yall
be spendin yall guap on these little hookers either, you heard?
Wake up in the mornin with your dick
lookin like a trophy. Word to mother. Ask K-Rock.
Hey, with me naked you know them bitches
is burnin and shit.
We all goin in the living room to fuck
with the PlayStation real quick. Let me see your pot first too, son.
- What up, Tang? Wake up in the mornin
with your dick lookin like a trophy. Word to mother. Ask K-Rock.
I did a bad thing.
But to a bad guy.
A very, very bad guy. All right? And for
a good reason.
You think thats a rationalization, right?
Thats what youre thinkin? Youre here.
Have you prayed for guidance?
No, I couldnt do that.
Why not?
Cause prayers were not gonna get me
what I needed.
Is that more important than your relationship
with God? No matter what you may have done
Hes ready to forgive you.
He is, 
And were all imperfect creatures.
And were led to sin.
Thats why we have to surrender our souls
to God.
But to be honest with you, Ive been
here before, all right?
Asking for Gods help. A lot of times.
Okay?
And my situation is not gettin any sunnier,
you know?
So, so why should it now?
Your pride is denying the possibility of
Gods goodness.
Why does he get all the glory? You know?
Why is that? He gets all the glory,
and I get all the blame.
I mean, is it not possible
That maybe God isnt carryin his end
of the weight?
Look, this thing is obviously weighing
on you.
So release it. Confess your sin.
Pray for forgiveness.
I dont want Gods forgiveness.
I want his fuckin help.
Uh, is that so hard? Im sorry. Im
sorry.
Lets just, lets do a few Hail Marys
and go. Okay?
Thats, thank you. Thank you.
This has been really good, thank you.
Okay, Ma-ha-. Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee. Blessed arst thou
amongst women. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death, amen.
Thank you.
Sal.

-Just, you know.
And now, the medias shoveling shit on
our badges
Over the shooting that took place there.
We have to remind the public
That one man from this unit cannot sustain
the sum total of our efforts.
That we are not in the business of harming
the public, but of helping it.
Weve been entrusted with the responsibility
to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
This is where we accomplish that, gentlemen.

You keep sayin that shit. But you know

He gets me outta the car and hes, hes

You know, a whole lotta cash has passed
through your hands over the last two years.
I aint stole so much as a nickel since
I been on the job. You aint got shit.
Oh, you do not want me to put a microscope
up your ass.
Cause if I do, I will keep lookin
until I find somethin.
Or until you plant somethin?
Watch that.
Now you listen to me.
You think youre a tough guy?
Cause you did undercover at Clinton
Correction?
You even survived a little incident.
If you know so much about me
Then maybe you should stop fuckin
with me. Now you got a case, bring it.
But until that time, step off.
Dude.
Hey. Hey.
Wait.
Was this shit supposed to be serious? You
expect me to stand there and listen to that? Get the fuck outta here.

So one of these wiseguys gets, pinched

Robbing dealers in Brooklyn. Prick.
If you cant handle the risk, you shouldnt
do it in the first place.

bad.
Ronny. Are you retarded? Im talkin

Boy Scouts of America over here.
- Girl Scout. Yo, throw me a couple cookies,

These wiseguys, they break the law to become
wiseguys. Right?
And then as soon as shit goes bad, they
break their bullshit mafia codes
To get witness protection under the same
laws they were breaking in the first place.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. I wasnt
talkin about the fuckin mafia. I was talkin about us.
About cops. I dont know about you,

Would you, would you do it? Tell em,
Sal. Come on.
We all know where that money goes, all
ri-? Better still, we know where it doesnt go.
Its not going to rehab clinics. That
money is not going to junkies to help with their families.

right? Cause I havent had a raise in four years, all right?
They got millions of dollars sittin
