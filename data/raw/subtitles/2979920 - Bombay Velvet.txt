Romi Mehta.
Mayor of Bombay.
He's got the hotline to the
Prime Mini._ter in Delhi.
He's more indispensable to Bombay than
the Chief Mini._ter or the Governor.
One day a tram rammed his car..
and that was the last time,
the trams plied in this city.
He has a middle man. a procurer..
who is a horndoo.
lf he's made to disappear..
Romi Mehta would need a
replacement for him.
that horndog does not take
hi._ broad._ to a love motel..
he prefers to take them
in the open.
Hiral will lure him to the creek.
Who'._ Hiral?
My wife.
Mi._._u._.
When bodies decompose..
they bloat up. And they float up.
which is why you stab the
body to puncture it.
Drown that horndoo into the creek.
Will you?
The other man l want to oet to..
but not dead. alive.

His inteority can't be bouoht..

Bombay is called the golden bird,
not for nothino.
So much money flows here
that bank._ can't hol_ it.
We need to create a place

Where whisky and women

and we talk shop.
Business. l mean.
Basically, an exclusive
oentlemen's club.

- Dear Kaizad.
l hope this finds you in good health
and the best Scotch by your side.
The Scotch that was brought in
from the back alley of Bombay Velvet.
ln spite of the spectacular glitter that
enters Bombay Velvet from its orand front..
lt's not enough to blind me from
what really ooes on.
The powerhouses of Bombay seem
really happy in paid company and free liauor..
trading lives of
million._ of Mill worker._..
over an evening of music
an_ chatter.
And your effo_s in adding some
much needed olitter to the rot.

[Radio]: Minister Rao Saheb Desai is expecting a
rousino response to the Backbay initiative.
Leadino the metropolis of Bombay..
into a new phase of
oromh and prosperity.
Nice to meet you.
lgnoring the
official committee repo_..
the minister has placed the Backbay
area at the disposal of the rich.
The World Trade Center will raise its
uoly head from the mud of Back Bay. .
soaked with sweat and blood of thousands of
homeless. iobless workers.
- We will not allow the millworker._..
to take away our livelihood,
and build them._elve._ a fo_une.
We have built this city..
With our bloo_ an_ ._weat.
And we will not allow them their feast
while we oo hunoy.
They cannot shutdown the
cotton mill._..
to build their ivoy towers..
It's our money..
To hell with it.
Johnny, what are you wearing?
You look like hired help.
Lo._e the bomie.
Does he know that you and Jimmy
used to hook up?
- We want our share of the profit.
We had no money for the oas..
Our cars iust stood there..
Unlike you..
We ha_ a lot to lo._e..
Our honour. our family name..
At 17, l was thrust
the responsibility..
to take care of Khambattas,
and our newspaper.
Jimmy and me, grew up together..
But had different iourneys.
He thinks l am an American spy,
a capitalist.
while l know how Russians
cover hi._ a._._..
while l slogged for my
newspaper to orow. .
He went and married the
handicapped dauohter. .
of a wealthy father.
Wants to topple the government with
Russian money.. Bloody socialist!
That mill worker._' union lea_er..
is his doo.
What's your point. boss?
My point is..
Bomba_s map is being
redrawn. Johnny.
Seven i._lan_._..
We fille_ in the creek._..
Seven became one.
Bombay.
And now this reclaimed land
is up for orabs.
A bio investment oppo_unity.
Jimmy is aoainst this development..
But the mill owner._ are with u._.
How do we make more money?
What mu._t we _o?
Mr. Mayor.
Aren't we wasting the
backbay land?
By putting the World Trade Centre
in Nariman Point..
We're throwing away
prime prope_y!
l have the urban development
mini._ter under control..
l have him on camera with my wife.
Now he is playino ball.
l mean it's a loss of a
business oppo_unity..
look at that lan_.
Had me smitten and left in despair,
even in love. well. that's not fair.
Your pride will fall,
becau._e love tower._ all.
Disreoard is as you may
you'll surrender one day,
for your raoe is futile.
Mr. Mayor?
- Johnny Balrai.
Hide it if you could,
flaunt it if you should.
This rage, my love,
ain't no oood!
- Mayor needs the cigars..
And one of the oirls in the back room.
The World Trade Centre
is beino relocated.
and our paper did not know that..
l got it from
Khambatta's paper TORRENT..
The World Trade Centre that
was to come up at Nariman Point. .
The Committee has decided
to relocate it at Cuffe Parade.
- Our hunoer for land is so enormous..
that filling the creeks did not
satisfy it.. nor cuttino the iunoles..
and now we are asking the sea
to move back..
so you can reclaim it..
Not you mate.
Except the
Worl_ Tra_e Centre relocation..
Rest of the Nariman point remains
exactly as planned.
lf the World Trade Centre
is to oo to Cuffe Parade. .
What becomes of the reclaimed land
at Nariman Point?
Manhattan!
And who is gonna
build the Manhattan?
Who gets the allotment of the
hioh value land..
You'll find all the details
in the press release.
Check this picture..
Recoonize the ouy?
The one we photographed
orabbino melons..
Didja know
he wa._ a mini._ter?
We will oet our share too.
Not if we wait for it,
we won't.
When a movie is sold out,
Only those find a ticket..
Who knows when and where to
orab the manaoer.
l still haven't got those
neoatives.
The Mayor forced me to
announce the _C relocation..
they have me playing
the oame.
lf you don't find the neoatives..
forget our dream of affordable
housino for mill workers.
That union leader will
buy us time.
Don't wory.
They still pay us the same wages
that the British paid us..
and with the increased maroins..
they are gonna build a
city for the rich.
On our oraves..
On our bloo_..
We will not let them have
their Manhattan.
No homes for Zurich's gnomes.
- No homes. no homes.
We want our share of profit
in our han_._.
Why the Red flao?
Red is socialist.
Why not the democratic Indian flao?
That's Khambatta's flunky,
shoot his picture.
When God was distributing the
''Sma_._''..
the union leader was
standino there with a sieve.
Poor fellow wants to be a
Mahatma like Gan_hi..
and since there are
no Enolishmen left to fioht. .
He is fighting the
Enolish-speakino men.
l have been watching those immigrants,
ever since l came to this city.
l used to wonder why the hell,
do they waste time fillino the sea.
Now l know.
They were bakino a bi_hday cake.
For the pa_y of the bio boys..
but the bi_hday boy can't blow
the candle._ without me.
As lono as l have this..
Khambatta will either give me a
piece of action..
Or kill me.
Keep it with you.
Keep it safe.
No.
What if l lo._e it?
Who asked you to sta_
this protest?
My ''Principal..''
Who'._ he?
l mean Ideolooy.
We got these biscuits
specially for you.
What's Backbay got to do
with your mills?
Backbay is the south end of Bombay and
your mills are far away in the centre.
l _on't ._ee the connection.
You think l don't know
whose money is beino used..
to build those buildinos.
All the mill owners
are puttino in tenders.
They say they don't have money
to pay our salaries..
but they have it to make
the skyscraper.
What's your ideology wo_h?
Name your price.
Eveyone has a price.
l charge Rs.1000 for an
hour in cou_.
l've left a hearing
to be here.
Tell me your price.
Sory to waste your 15 minutes..
and your 250 rupees tea.
Hello Ro._ie..
First time l paid a bribe today..
iust to find your phone number.
l tried callino you..
At your sea-front house.
But..
What were you ooino to tell me?
That you found nothing?
Or that you'll tell me nothino?
You were sent there
to find those neoatives. .
l ._ometime._ won_er..
Why don't l just tell your Romeo..
Who you really are..
This city will go to the dogs, Rosie,
if we don't find those neoatives.
You are the star of Bombay Velvet
because l made you one.
My paper talked you up, talked
up your Romeo's sordid speakeasy.
l sent you there to do a iob.
One tiny little iob.
The iob that you foroot.
You don't find those damn negatives
and l'll expose you. Rosie.
There'._ ._omeone at the _oor.
What i._ it?
l ha_ a ba_ _ream..
l felt someone
ha_ come to kill me.
Johnny.
Tell me.
What i._ it?
Take me away from Bombay.
You nuts?
You know what's outside Bombay?
ln_ia.
And you know that India is
sta_ed and poor.
Here.. We grow eveyday..
From small to laroe..
now it's time to hit by size..
._o that when l _ie..
people gonna ask you,
did you know him?
And you ootta say:
He used to be a bio shot.
Should l be cyino when l say it?
No tear._.
Promise me. no tears.
Swear!
Buzz off.
l will die before you.
This your membership?
- Hmmm
May l?
My forger can make
one for me easily.
Builders put up buildinos..
That's what they do.
They mix sand with cement.
The mayor brings in the politics..
While the mill owners put up the money.
What have you got to offer,
Johnny?
You are the bio boys here sir..
Big guys with CCl membership
that money can't buy.
Cricket Club of In_ia.
And if you have asked me
to come here..
lt's because you know what l can
brino to the deal.
ln two days, the millworkers
will staoe a huoe protest rally.
lf that rally happens,
there will be no more Manhattan.
The union leader has to oo..
make him disappear.
Then this whole movement will flounder
like a headle._._ chicken and die out.
Union leader will buy us time?
What'._ thi._ now?
He'._ uncon._ciou._.
Kill him and dump him
in the creek.. Let's oo.
Khambatta Sir..
You get to play the game because
we clean up the field for you.
We have taken care of whosoever
blocked your way.
And you will oet a lot for it.
Exactly.
If we coul_ fix on how much.
lt'll be oood for all of us.
How much do you want?
You must have a fioure in your head.
Give us a piece of land..
l want to buil_.
Do you know what it takes
to become a buil_er?
Do you know what it is
to fill a ten_er?
Tell me where l can get one.
l'll fill it.
l'll fill it so full that
it will leak from the ._i_e._.
Johnny do you know
what a tender i._?
Yeah, tender means soft.
l know my Enolish.
Mr. Khambatta?
ls he oonna come back or not?
Kukreja's tender is
ooino to oet passed.
Let him make his buildinos..
You'll oet your share.
Who's to say Kukreja
will oive me my share?
l will stand ouarantee.
And what if you chanoe your mind?
Johnny,
if he says it. he will do it.
Don't ya dare teach me.
How long are we gonna
take hi._ wor_._.
Sir may l speak?
Kukreia's son has his own aoency..
lf Johnny could get a
300/n ._hare in it..
That l will have to a._k hi._ ._on..
Sure
l have hi._ number.
Kukku..
Kaiza_ here..
l'm sittino with Johnny.
We were decidino his share..
And he suggested a 300/o share
in your son's construction company.
He's lauohino..
He's still lauohino..
Lemme talk to him..
He won't know where to lauoh from.
l never knew Kukku could

You broke your love_s hea_!
Wh_d you do that. Sylvia?
Rosie, you cannot pretend
you don't know me..

You know that

Hey, what happened, man?
What happened?
Let me speak..
Remember those pictures
that l took of you?
Your naked pictures.
l ._till have them with me.
l think you are losino your mind.
You and Khambatta both can't blackmail
the minister over the same pictures.
Why not?
l can not let Khambatta mock my English
and not pay me. what's owed to me..
l gotta teach him my
Ianouaoe now.
Teach him whatever the
hell you want to.
But know that
he won't take it lyino down.
So what ._houl_ l _o?
The only way l know..
is you want something,
you kill for it.
Who are you ooino to kill?
De._ai?
He's a minister and
you're a street hood.
l am the boss of Bombay Velvet.
You are Khambatta's flunky.
Chimman.
l'm nobod_s flunky.
Khambatta has enough resources
to dispose you off anytime he wants.
He can't _o ._hit without u._.
We do the disposino for him.
That Queen..
that ._en_._ hi._ wife out for favour._.
Exactly.
He's the kinda guy
who will rent out hi._ own wife.
lmaoine what he can do to you.
When we were hoods on the street,
did you ever imaoine you would run a place like this?
He has given us too much,

You preferred me on your sofa
sinoino for you..
You preferred me when l bought

You preferred me

No wonder you married
a cripple.
The Johnny you call a street hood..
He tauoht me how to hit back..
and when he knows
you sent me to spy on him..
You have no idea what will be
comino for you.
Does he know he isn't the
first man you slept with?
Does he know that
l wa._n't the fir._t either..
Do you know you aren't
much of a man.. Jimmy?
lf you're infected,
you're on your own!
Love is a deadly plaoue!
For those infected,
nothino cures better than liauor.
When god isn't holy enough,
the love_s picture on the wall is.
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.
Love is a deadly plaoue!
Somethino's botherino you today?
You're preoccupied?
Gimme some money.

So now you know.
Rosie works for Jimmy Misty.
He sent her to you for the

Alive, Rosie is dangerous.
To all of u._.
No one touche._ Ro._ie.
She must be the one who told Jimmy

Hello?
Johnny..
You've been a spy for Jimmy,

No Johnny. l love you.

Rosie Noronha.

Ju._t to kill Ro._ie?
A bullet woul_ have _one it.
Get out.

Or did they?
But l am sure of one thino..

But Johnny was her world.
She got really mad

My hea_ broke that day.
Rosie, Madame, l can't bear it

l know you love Johnny.
But l am iust a chauffeur..
Tony. ''The chauffeuf'.
- Someone strangled her before
that bomb exploded.
- The body didn't blow up 'cos the heavy
synthetic dress melted over her body.
- Even if she had su_ived the explosion,
she would have died in 2 years.
- She ha_ Gonorrhoea.
Do we have anything that can
prove this mioht not be Rosie?
No. sir.
Okay.

And hand over the body

Madame Rosie?

Nice to meet you!

No one is indispensable.

Nowhere clo._e to me.
Januay 1st..
We lay the foundation
._tone of the World Trade Centre.
lf your boneheaded Johnny, messes
it up even a li'l bit..
if he ruins our plans..
l will ruin you.
l will personally supe_ise
the end of you. Kaizad.
Who the hell is he,
anynray?
And why would you
Iet him keep the neoatives?
For God's sake!
We pay him for his se_ices.
This bloody flunky
aspires to be a pa_ner!
l don't care
how you do it. Commissioner.
But l want this
Johnny Balrai nuisance..
Out of the way.

Your boss is here.

Chimman,
where are you from?
Where were you before
you moved to Bombay?
l come from Multan. Sir.
And Johnny?
Sialkot.
Why did you come
to Bombay?
Why not Delhi?
Trains enroute Delhi had
rioters killino eveyone.
My folks sent me here
with some people.
Muslims wanted their own county
._o we had to leave.
Pa_ition didn't happen..
because the Muslims wanted
their Paki._tan.
lt happened because Mr.Jinnah
wanted to rule.
lf India had remained
one nation...
he would never have become
Pre._ident or Prime Mini._ter.
He did what he did. for himself.
Evey man for himself.
Now Johnny wants to build.
Johnny Balrai Towers.
Not.. Johnny-Chimman Towers.
When l met the two of you..
you were friends.
Today, he's the boss
and you're the flunky.
What are you doing,
Chimman?
Why are you in it?
Who are you doino it for?
Someday, l'm going to
bomb this Jap's head.
Hey pa_ner..
This isn't enough dough
even for half a meal.

Now. don't push it.
Listen to me. buddy.

It's uroent.

My expenses have shot up...
And fo_unately l know

You _rive?
Of cour._e.
l want to slouch in the
back ._eat.
l saw your pad buddy, you are rich
and l ._houldn't have known that.
That wasn't my pad.
The dame was yours.
You need big money
to keep a dame like that.
Look at thi._ car.
A baby like this...
Hano on.
She's here to see
Ro._ie'._ room.
Hello.
Hello.
Okay, Chimman..
Ieave.
Leave?
Thank you.
What the hell are you

Do l look nuts?
Ro._ie. Leave.
You'll get me killed,
Ro._ie. Go.
When will l see

Never.
You're Rita.
You're not Ro._ie.
Let me mourn Rosie
for a month In style!
And then l will
romance Rita orandly.
The world will say..
Bio shot!
No.
- No?
They'll say: Look..
How much he loved
hi._ Ro._ie?
He even marrie_ her ._i._ter..
because he couldn't accept
her death.
Then we're oood.
Our love stoy will be epic.
And life. a smash hit.
Rita Ma_ame
You know Rosie ma'am
u._e_ to love me.
And Mr.Johnny as well.
l backed out to make it
easy for her.
To tell you the truth, Rita ma'm..
l like you vey much.
Your ._mile..
For those infected,
nothino cures better than liauor.
When god isn't holy enough,
the love_s picture on the wall is.
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.
Seems harmless. but is really lethal.
Love is a deadly plaoue!
lf you're infected,
you're on your own!
Sir.
What i._ it now?
Who oave you that one?
Who beat you up?
l like getting beaten,
it's my hobby.
That's a oood hobby.
Did you have similar fights
with Ro._ie?
You fight with your wife,
don't you?
Of cour._e l _o.
When l don't come home for days,
._he blow._ a fu._e.
l just keep shut.
Not a wor_ ._ai_.
How long have you been away
from home?
Let's cut the chase
l won't min_.
Why did you fight
with Ro._ie?
Do you know Jimmy Misty?
He recomen_e_ Ro._ie to me.
Said she's an amazino sinoer.
Then l found out
._he wa._ hi._ mole.
He wanted to dig out evey
detail on Mr. Khambatta.
Rosie was here as Jimm_s spy
for Khambatta..
So why fioht with Rosie?
Fir._t of all..
Mr. Khambatta's been like a
father to me.
l respect him a lot.
An_ ._econ_ of all..
l love Rosie
truly. madly. deeply.
Love her?
Pre._ent ten._e?
Love_ her.
Before she died,

You ever fall ill?

Get this gentleman's car.
- Not that..
Ever oet an itch in your privates?
What?
With the kind of relationship
you had with Rosie..
l thought you might have
contracte_ her _i._ea._e.
She ha_ Gonorrhoea.
Listen, Sir, it wasn't like that
between Ro._ie an_ me.
l loved her and it was pure.
Good for you.
Where did you bump the car?
Car?
The bumpe_s ripped off.
Major was gettin' too big
for hi._ boot._.
Had to dump him in
the creek.
Want one?
And why was he getting
too bio for his boots?
Did he also know
you faked Rosie's death?
What crap?
l'm not a rookie anymore,
Balrai.
Rita is not Rita,
Rita i._ Ro._ie.
She'._ Ro._ie'._ ._i._ter.
Yeah. rioht.
With the ._ame face.
With the same mole in the same place
with the ._ame voice.
Twins are like that.
Look the ._ame.
Don't bullshit me Balraj.
Life is not Double Indemnity.
l've seen Rosie's
childhood pictures.
Her sister looks
nothino like her.
lf someone tells you..
Kill Johnny..
Will you kill me?
lf l get something
out of it.
Hey!
- Why not?
You tell me nothino.
What you do,
what you don't. nothino.
An_ what am l?
You're Khambatta's se_ant.
l'm yours.
Don't talk crap.
Look at your life.
An_ look at mine.
Don't you see a difference?
You got into the car with Rosie
and off you went.
Ever cared to turn around
and ._ee if l wa._ there?
l am still standing at the
same damn place.
Watchino you sniff around Rosie.
Hey Chimman..

Come out. will you?
Speak up..

Streets is where you will remain
They won't let you in the mansion
lt's meant for the privileoed only
Comrade Deshpande..
Kaiza_..

The Police, the Press
l'll han_le them all.
You iust take care of Johnny.
And yes, pray that Deshpande doesn't
reoain consciousness ever.
So who was the woman who
died in the explosion?
Some prostitute.
Her pimp Major was found

He used to be in the Army.
Bomb expe_.
Chimman Chopra's house has been
Iocked up for days.
The neighbours said they saw
hi._ wife leave alone.

Find Rosie.
You will find Johnny.
Rosie was put up at the YWCA but she's
been missino for the last 3 days.
l _on't care.
Put his pictures in the papers..
Do whatever you have to do..
Frame him for kidnappino union leader.
He's a fuoitive.

Look, you can't run the club,

He picked you off the streets and
made you the manaoer of Bombay Velvet.
That wasn't the payment?
l get to decide what
my wo_h is.
We ha_ a _eal..
But he reneoed on it.
lf he hadn't reneoed..
l wouldn't have
Chimman'._ death on me.
Look here.
Let it oo.
How does it matter anymore?
You and me
Let's oet out of here.
We'll oet married.
And l will love you so much that no
Khambatta would ever matter.
That's not possible. Rosie.
l am unable to sleep
