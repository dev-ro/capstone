Fay.
Excuse me, sir?
Excuse me?
Could you tell me
how to get back on route 80?
Sure, honey, just go down the road
about a mile, turn right at the light.
Hey!
Toss the bag on the seat and
I won't blow your fucking head off.
- Are you kidding me?
- You can die laughing if you think so.
Ain't gonna ask you again.
Dumb ass!
Hey! Hey, watch it!
Pay attention, will ya?
Okay.
I was expecting maybe 10 or 15 grand.
So what? We hit the jackpot!
What's wrong?
We gotta get out of Nevada, honey.
That's what's wrong.
You promised me we could go to Vegas.
I don't think you understand the kind
of people that we're dealing with, honey.
You better listen to what I'm saying.
I think we should head north for a while,
maybe just hide out.
Okay. We'll split the money fifty-fifty.
You do what you want. I'm going to Vegas.
Honey, don't fuck with me.
Okay? Don't fuck with me.
I'm not in the mood for it.
You let me off with my half
at the next bus stop.
'Cause I'm going to Vegas.
- What did you say?
- You heard.
- Open the door, Fay.
- No!
Open the door and let me in!
Open the door!
Fuck you, Vince.
Take your hand off the lock.
Open the door!
You ain't going anywhere without me.
If I thought that money was gonna come
between us, I'd just as soon burn it up.
We gotta stay together, baby.
Right?
Come on, honey, I gotta take a piss.
You can go by yourself.
I've seen you do it before.
Yeah, well, I like your company.
Idaho. You're gonna love it there, baby.
I know a little place...
called Hell's Canyon.
It's real peaceful up there.
Lots of hunting, and fishing...
We could hide out for six months,
maybe a year.
Who knows? Maybe we'll never come back.
Yeah.
I bet you're starting to get hungry.
Guess we won't be going
to Hell's Canyon after all, Vince?
Jesus, Jack.
Got anything here that's worth a shit?
Hey, there's nothing in there.
Hey, who's this?
- Wife, girlfriend, or something?
- It's personal.
Nice looking piece of ass.
- Jack.
- I said it was personal.
Did you forget the rules?
You took out a loan, Jack.
You gotta pay it back.
Ten grand. Next Wednesday.
Don't fuck it up.
Can you believe this? At her age.
You know, I'd never try to change
what I was dealt to begin with. Would you?
I hope I don't live long enough
to worry about it.
You got a good point there.
Now, check out time is 11, hon.
Okay.
- Could I borrow that?
- Oh, go ahead.
I don't read 'em anyway.
Thanks.
Daddy! Daddy, there's a man
in the bathroom!
- See!
- Are you alright?
That fucking bitch.
I need a ride.
I'd give you a ride, mister,
but I don't have any room.
- Sure we do, Dad, we got plenty of room.
- Go wait in the car, son.
No room?
Eight hundred,
seventy-five thousand dollars.
Well, how about Holback Chapel,
any of those guys ever pay up?
Those deadbeats are even broker
than you are, if that's possible.
Leave it, Teri, leave it.
What difference does it make?
Hey, look.
What about that place in Maine?
Where you and Kathy used to go.
What's it called...
something "Harbor?"
"Safe Harbor."
Yeah, Safe Harbor.
Reno's eaten away at you,
for Christ's sake.
There's nothing here for you anymore.
Happy anniversary.
Can I help you?
I'm...
looking for Mr. Andrews.
That's me.
- And you're Mrs....
- Miss. Fay Forrester.
Come in.
The work you do is totally confidential,
isn't that right?
That's right. It's guaranteed.
Well...
There's a man.
We were...
involved in a relationship.
He's not right in the head.
He's trying to kill me.
I see.
I don't love him anymore.
I tried to make that clear to him,
but he won't accept it.
And he won't leave me alone.
See, there's no one
to protect me from him.
My folks are both passed away.
I don't have any other family.
There's no one I can turn to.
And you've tried talking to the police?
I can't prove anything. They can't arrest
the guy unless he murders me.
- And what do you want me to do?
- I want you to kill me.
I mean...
I wanna make it look
like I've been killed.
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?
Look...
I made a...
I made a real mess out of things.
I... I want Fay Forrester to die,
so I can take on a new identity.
Is that too much to ask?
It's not that easy. What you want me
to do is illegal. It's a kind of fraud.
This man is gonna kill me.
You think I care about fraud?
I'm just saying that it's not
without a lot of risk.
I'll pay you ten thousand dollars.
Half now, the other half after I'm dead.
That's a lot of money
to be carrying around.
Please, Mr. Andrews.
I can't sleep at night.
I'm scared all the time.
The next time he finds me...
You have to help me!
Ms. Forester,
are you telling me the truth?
This is from the last time I saw him.
Ten thousand's plenty. I'll take half now,
and the other half when the job's done.
Plus expenses.
- So you'll do it?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
There's no guarantee it'll work, and you're
gonna have to be honest with me.
Of course.
I don't know, Jack.
Something about it don't seem right.
You think this girl is telling you the truth?
No.
You should see her.
Anyway, her money's green either way.
Just cause you'd stick your neck
out for a skirt in trouble,
- that don't mean that I have to.
- You interested or not?
Take it easy, I'm just saying...
that you got this nice guy complex.
This whole thing with Kathy.
Sometimes you act like an asshole.
I got a piano salesman for a psychiatrist.
- Only difference is I give advice for free.
- Alan, it's just a job.
You in or not?
Yeah. What the hell,
what's the worst that could happen?
- When do I start?
- Right now.
I need a pint of type A negative blood.
Seriously?
And will that be a single or a double?
I'd like a double bed, but I'm single.
Okay.
Room 15.
What you wanna do, is go out this door...
and...
you go... you go right... you go...
- Straight... why don't I just show you?
- Okay.
- I'll get this for you.
- I'll take that.
- You sure, Ms. Forester?
- Really.
Alright.
Why don't you call me Fay?
- Alright, Fay. Call me Tim.
- Okay, Tim.
So you're sure the clerk
in the motel will remember you?
- He'll remember me.
- Alright.
Then...
should be able to go tonight.
Oh, yeah, here's...
Your new ID.
- West Virginia?
- It was all I could get.
Great!
They look so real.
What do you think you'll do after tonight?
I don't know. I haven't really
thought about it that much.
- You like to gamble?
- Depends on what's at stake.
Seven.
- Seven.
- Alright!
Hi!
Hi.
How'd you do at craps?
Great. I won five hundred dollars.
- You had those guys at the table going.
- Yeah, it was fun.
Wish you could've joined me.
What's that?
Blood.
Same type as yours.
- How'd you get blood?
- It's not that hard.
This is the part I've been waiting for.
The murderer probably...
came here, and... had a few drinks
with you. Go ahead.
The cops love lipstick and...
fingerprints.
So...
You were probably there on the bed, and...
he was here...
Yeah?
And he probably made a pass at me.
Come here.
Probably...
drunk, and...
tried to rough you up.
Yeah, but I tried to fight him off.
Show me how. We gotta make it look real.
You can do better than that, Jack.
You gotta do a good job.
This is costing me a lot of money.
Come on. Come on, rip it!
I would've put up a fight.
And then...
the murderer gets tired of wrestling.
And decides...
to kill the bitch.
And take her money.
Exhibit A.
Wanna put some on me?
I gotta put some...
holes in your dress, first.
Wouldn't it be easier
if I took my dress off?
Sorry.
I always wondered what it'd be like
to die a really violent death.
Well, now you know.
Yeah.
Just lie there like you're dead.
You left everything in here?
Except my car keys, which you have.
Don't laugh, you're dead.
- What are you doing?
- Putting you in the trunk.
Quiet!
We did it?
I can't wait to start being Vera Billings.
- You're still gonna have to be careful.
- Yeah, I know.
You know...
I gotta tell you something.
When I first met you...
I thought you were a loser.
Why'd you hire me?
Why'd you take the job?
Anyway...
I was wrong.
You make a great murderer.
Why don't you come over
to my room when you get back?
I'll pay you the rest of your cash.
We'll celebrate.
It'll take me a couple of hours
to go to the lake and back.
I don't mind.
Jesus!
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be careful.
What're you sneaking up on me
like that for?
I'm sorry, I was just try... take it easy.
She didn't go all the way down?
No. Doesn't matter.
The cops will just find it sooner.
Yeah. This is a spooky place at night.
You know, this used to be
sacred Indian land?
They say that there's ghosts,
ghosts and spirits, you know?
So when do we get paid?
- Tomorrow.
- Want some?
Hallelujah, boy.
Fay?
Hi. I'm looking for a woman named
Billings. Have you seen her?
I remember her, good looking.
Friend of yours?
Yeah.
- It's important.
- Well, let's see.
She only checked in early this morning,
and she checked out about two hours ago.
I know because I had to get her
a cab to take her to the airport.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, of course I'm sure.
I wouldn't forget a thing like that.
I'm not that old.
Unbelievable.
Oh, yeah, I remember her. Definitely.
- Hard to forget if you know what I mean.
- Yeah.
Yeah, she took flight 405 to Las Vegas.
- Got away from you.
- Yeah, she sure did.
When's the next flight?
Next available is...
tomorrow morning, 11 am.
Thanks for all your help.
Good luck.
Hey, Andrews.
Jack Andrews,
we got a warrant for your arrest.
The hell you do.
Come on.
- You got a warrant for that?
- Yeah. Get him out of here.
- When did you first meet Fay Forrester?
- Never heard of her.
Where were you at 11:40 last night, Jack.
Drinking. With friends. Alan Swayze.
- What's his phone number?
- You got a phone book, look it up.
- Ever been in the Rancho Sierra?
- What's that, a whorehouse?
- Got any debts, Jack?
- A few, why?
- How'd you get that broken finger?
- Closing the file cabinet.
Who gave you the scratch
on the face, Jack?
What scratch?
You used to be a pretty normal,
law-abiding citizen, Jack.
Degree in business,
insurance investigator for three years.
- Married... briefly.
- And you got a point?
Well, then things kinda go downhill.
1987, drunk and disorderly.
'88, a week in jail
for withholding evidence.
I was protecting a client.
Two current moving violations,
and $270 in outstanding parking tickets.
Parking tickets. You got me.
Jack, there's somebody I want you to meet.
Is this the man you saw last night?
Take your time.
- No, he doesn't look anything like him.
- You sure?
This guy was big, mean-looking!
I can't believe Fay was with this guy.
I can't believe she's...
It's okay, Tim, thanks.
You're a murder suspect
in this case, Jack.
And as such, you're forbidden by law
from leaving Washoe County
without permission in writing from me.
- You understand that, Jack.
- You're wasting your time.
You know...
there was another woman
that disappeared...
in a car, in a lake,
a couple of years ago.
You were there, Jack.
Maybe there's a connection.
Hey, Sam, come on. Everybody knows
that was an accident. Give the guy a break.
Oh, yeah, sure,
that was an accident, wasn't it?
He managed to save his own skin...
Son of a bitch! Get him out of here!
Get him out of here
before I break his fucking neck!
Get him out of here!
A suspect, Reno private
investigator Jack Andrews,
was arrested in connection
with the alleged murder,
but was released this morning
after questioning.
That ain't gonna be too good
for business, is it, Jack?
So, you think she set you up or what?
She wouldn't set me up,
I'd blow her whole scheme.
There had to be some minor connection.
Unless she wanted people to think
that she was trying to be dead.
I don't care what she's trying to pull.
She owes me and I wanna collect.
Oh, man, you hear what you're saying?
Listen to you!
Jack, blow it off. You leave town
and Hendricks is gonna send you to jail.
Then I'll do the 30 days and pay the fine.
I want you to check
all the hotels in Vegas.
She's probably under
the name of Vera Billings.
Vera Billings.
Alright. I'll get on it right away.
And try to get back here
as soon as you can.
I got nobody minding the store
'til Teri comes back.
What do you say, Jack? Going somewhere?
No. Just walking my friend to his car.
- Have a nice trip.
- Yeah. Thanks, Jack.
Excuse me, boys.
Drive careful.
What are you guys doing here?
I still got a couple of days.
Heard you was in jail.
Thought there might be a problem.
There's thirty-four hundred.
Very good, Jack. Very good.
Where'd you get it?
Don't you read the papers?
I killed somebody.
Funny guy!
Come on, you'll get
the rest in three days.
Now, I really hope you're not
thinking about leaving town.
Now why would I want to do that?
I'm very happy here.
Take care of that finger.
Yes.
I've been waiting
for my checking account balance.
Great.
Seven hundred and thirty-two...
Sorry, we're closed.
- Yeah, well, the door was open.
- My fault, sorry, but we're closed.
- Are you Jack?
- Yeah, but... like I said...
Jack Andrews.
- What'd you do with Fay Forrester.
- Never heard of her.
You're a fucking liar.
The cops got it wrong.
I never heard of her.
I've never heard of her!
Well, I'm gonna kill you anyway.
Alright, hold it! I said hold it!
Your gun ain't loaded, Jack.
How you feeling? Feeling alright?
Hi, how are ya? This is Jim Peterson,
calling from Reno.
I got some information here
for Mr. Maranot.
Sit down.
- Jim!
- Hey, Jonesy, how ya doing?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look, Mr. Maranot says the money was
wrapped in green rubber bands, all hundreds.
Yeah, well, a couple of my boys picked up
some cash that matches that description
from some small-time gambler
named Jack Andrews.
He's got some half-assed private
eye business. You ever heard of him?
No.
I sent my boys to pick him up,
but he was gone.
Well, keep looking, okay? If you find him,
Mr. Maranot is going to be very appreciative.
- Okay, Jonesy. We'll keep looking.
- Okay, Big Jim. Be good.
Right.
That Andrews is dead meat.
- Yeah, Collect from Jack.
- Hey, Jack, what the hell happened here?
Fay's boyfriend happened.
He's mean, and he may still be hanging
around there. So watch out for yourself.
- Me? What about you? Are you alright?
- Fine. Did you find her?
I checked all the big places and there was
no Vera Billings registered anywhere.
- Damn.
- But there was a...
a Virginia Billingsly
registered at the Hilton.
What do you say, this babe is one of the
most cunning criminal minds of the century.
Yeah, that sounds like her.
Listen, Alan, I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you this afternoon.Thanks.
- Take it easy, man.
- Bye.
Virginia Billingsly.
Excuse me.
I've got a special delivery
for a Virginia Billingsly.
Virginia... Billingsly.
- Oh, would you like me to ring her room?
- Oh, no, no, I have to hand deliver it.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm not allowed to give you
her room number. It's hotel policy.
Oh, I understand. But... See...
She's an old friend, and...
She doesn't know I'm coming into town,
and I wanted to surprise her.
I'm sorry.
The best I could do is call her.
Okay.
- Who should I say is calling?
- Jack Reno.
I'm sorry, sir, she's not answering.
Would you like to leave a message?
- No, I'll... I'll come back later.
- Okay.
Hi. What can I get ya?
Yeah?
This is Spiv. I think I found something
you'd be interested in.
Oh, yeah?
That's quite a dress you got there, Fay.
Jack, honey, hi. How're you doing?
You have to say goodbye
to your friends, Virginia.
- I'm on a roll here.
- Sorry, boys, time to go.
Come on, Virginia.
Sorry, fellas. Gotta run.
So...
Want a drink or something?
Met your boyfriend.
- Does he know about me?
- Not yet.
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to run away from you.
But I was scared.
I didn't want anything to happen to you.
I'll pay you the rest of your cash.
You better just take your money and go.
What's going on?
- What's going on?
- Housekeeping.
Come back later?
Yeah. Yeah, that's him alright.
That's the son of a bitch who shot Marty,
and she's the one who drove away in the car.
Who are you guys, you got the...
- Put the gun down and relax.
- Where's the money?
There it is.
There it is. On the floor.
That's my briefcase!
Don't move.
See.
That's it alright.
You're dead, chump.
I don't wanna go to jail, Jack.
Come on.
Come on!
Where'd you get the money?
I'll tell you later.
Just drive the goddamn car.
You'll tell me later?
Jesus, Jack are you crazy?
What are you doing?
Jack, I'm scared!
What are you afraid of?
It was self-defense.
They'll check out my...
- They'll find out other things.
- What things, Fay?
Vince stole the money,
and I stole it from Vince.
These guys in Winemuka,
they were working for the mob.
Stealing money from casinos somehow.
Vince killed one of them.
I was there. It was awful.
The other guy was the one
who was just in the hotel room.
So we took off.
I tried to get away,
but he'd have killed me for sure!
So, I...
later, he fell asleep, and I hit him.
I hit him on the head.
I wanted to tell you the truth before...
but how could I?
I don't want to go to jail, Jack!
I'll die in there!
Is that what you want?
- Yes, sir?
- Is everything okay here, folks?
Yes, she's just... a little upset.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
Fay.
We're here. It's good.
It's safe. You'll love it.
Do you have any money?
I mean, can I have some? I'm broke.
For the rooms.
Rooms?
You know the air conditioner doesn't work.
It's okay.
The ice machine doesn't work either.
It's alright.
Alrighty, Mr. Burl.
Let's see, it'll be you, and...
My wife.
Alrighty.
Now...
26... 27...
28... 29...
30... 40...
60... 80... 100.
Thank you.
Okay.
You know, you look familiar to me.
Have you been up here before?
No. Wish I had, though. Beautiful spot.
Well, alrighty.
Thanks.
- Fay?
- Yeah?
- I've been thinking about tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah?
There's a place up in Maine.
I used to work in insurance,
I found it. It's called...
"Safe Harbor."
I was married.
She died, and...
- I never wanted to stay in Reno, but...
- Shit!
I never wanted to stay in Reno.
She and I thought we'd go there.
There's some really
beautiful houses along the coast.
I think it'd be a good place for us.
- You want me to go with you to Maine?
- Why not?
I figure you and I...
have a chance to start over.
Most people don't get that second chance.
- You really feel that way about me?
- No.
- I think you're a greedy, two-faced bitch.
- What?
There's no reason
I should trust you, but I want to.
If you're straight with me,
maybe we could help each other.
What do you say?
Two suspects have been identified
in yesterday's brutal slaying
in a Hilton Hotel room of Stanley Jones,
son-in-law of prominent Las Vegas
businessman William Maranot.
Police are searching for a woman
using the name Virginia Billingsly.
The male suspect has been identified
as Jack Andrews, a resident of Reno.
A manhunt for these suspects
is currently underway
and roadblocks have been set up
at checkpoints around the state.
Anyone having information that could help
the investigation should call the Neva...
Maranot's only the biggest
crime family in Nevada, Fay.
- Let's just get out of here.
- Roadblocks!
We couldn't get 20 miles.
You know what to do, Jack.
Kill me.
Kill me again.
You did it before. You could do it again.
We could die together.
- Stage and Studio.
- Hi, Alan, it's me.
Jack. Everybody's looking for you.
- Yeah, well... I'm gonna fix things.
- Wait, wait, how can I find you?
Listen, I'm not going to be here
long anyway. It doesn't matter.
Well, where are you going, man?
It's not important.
What about your place? All your stuff's
gonna get trashed. You've been evicted.
I don't care about any of that stuff.
If you can get any of it, it's yours.
Are you doing this for her?
Hey, don't do anything stupid, man.
Don't worry, everything's fine.
Say... say hi to Teri for me.
Listen, I'm going to send you
and her some money. So...
look out for it.
- Hey, look, I gotta get going.
- Hey, wait...
- Jack! Jack!
- Take it easy.
Bye.
- Yes, this is the operator.
- Operator...
could you tell me
where that call originated from?
Yes, it was from Overton, Nevada.
Overton?
Thanks.
Overton?
Lake Mead.
I figure we gotta swim
about 200 yards to the shore.
It's perfect because it's one
of the deepest parts of the lake.
It's gonna make
a pretty good escape route.
Here we are.
This is it.
Yeah. That's Indian Rock.
See? I'll show you.
Right here.
This is where I'll sink the boat.
They'll search and search for us
for months, but they'll never find us.
The debris coming up,
that can only mean one thing.
Of course, like I say, we'll have a healthy
swim to the shore. And then about...
a five mile hike up to the drop point.
Five miles?
You'll make it.
Drop point's up there. And at that point,
we'll pick up the money and the supplies
we need to make the last leg of the hike.
Where do we hide the money?
We bury it, along with the supplies.
Right here.
On Indian Land. We hike 14 miles
across the state line into Arizona.
We'll buy a used car in Dalton for cash.
It was a lot easier last time.
Well... this time it's for keeps.
We faked the whole thing, man!
She's not... she's not really dead.
She's not dead.
Yeah, well, I knew she wasn't dead.
She's with your friend...
- isn't she? Isn't she?
- I don't know, I swear, man.
I think so, I don't know.
Don't lie to me, Al.
I don't like to be lied to.
I'm going alone, Fay.
- What?
- I'll bury the money, and the stuff.
Be back in a couple of hours.
- It'll be safer that way.
- I wanna go.
You wanna go? Why?
Because...
- I'm afraid.
- Afraid? Of what?
I'm afraid you won't come back.
Don't you trust me?
You don't have to take the money.
Trust me. I'll be back
in a couple of hours.
Okay.
You better come back, you son of a bitch.
- Where the fuck are they?
- I don't know, man.
Fuck, man! Leave me alone!
I don't know, man!
I'm not asking you again.
Where are they?
Son of a bitch!
You know, you got a whole pack
of these... swishy cigarettes here.
That's a whole pack, man.
You better start talking to me.
Overton! He called from Overton, man.
That's all I know, I swear.
Well, where the fuck is Overton?
Where's Overton?
It's up by Lake Mead, on the northern tip.
Okay, Al.
Betcha can't wait to get
out of that chair, can you?
Relax.
Look, just let me go, man. I promise
I won't say anything. Just let me go.
- You'll never see me again.
- Sure, Al.
Yep.
And one of those.
Thanks.
What are all the cop cars for?
They're looking for some killers.
Shot some folks up in Vegas, I hear.
Them Arizona cops, they watch the border
while the Nevada cops go to lunch.
That's mighty neighborly of them.
Yeah, it is.
Well, thanks.
Fay!
You might live through the rest of the day
if you tell me where my money is.
Jack, he's crazy.
He'll kill you.
Tell him where it is.
He'll let us go if you just tell him.
She's right.
I am fucking nuts.
Pull the trigger.
Okay, Mr. half-assed Dick Tracy,
tell me where the money is...
- or I'll shoot the bitch.
- Jack!
- Go ahead.
- Jack!
Tell him, please!
Come on.
- Kill her.
- Jack!
What exactly do you want, Jack?
Fay.
Half the money. Two days head start
till I tell you where your half is.
- Is that all?
- It's fair.
- That's better than nothing, Vince.
- Shut up!
What'll it be, Vince?
I need to think this over.
How're ya feeling, Jack?
Feeling alright?
How's your finger?
Nice wallet.
Hey!
That bastard's never gonna hurt me again!
Sorry, Fay.
Are you alright?
Open up in there, I'm coming in.
We're almost there. Get the map out.
- I left it.
- Left it?
We still have to walk out of the state.
I guess we'll have to wing it.
Come on, Fay.
Guess we won't be going
to Maine after all, Jack?
Go ahead, honey. Finish him off.
I think I got him.
Let's make sure.
Hey!
Let's get the hell out of here.
Hey, hey! Gimme that!
No more bullshit, you understand me?
Nice truck.
Hey, genius left the keys. Take this.
- Fuck... Jesus!
- Fuck!
Bastard!
- Roger 34, what's your 20?
- I-15 southbound.
- Turn around. Go back.
- We're gonna have to get out of here now.
What do we do?
How do we get our money back?
Shit!
Unit 52. Shots fired.
I'm in pursuit of a white Cadillac.
Tag numbers are wrong, but the model's
correct. I think it's Jack Andrews.
You're lucky we heard those shots.
- You're gonna have to go to the doctor.
- No, no.
How 'bout at the reservation?
There won't be any trouble.
Okay.
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I, of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When you heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them
And I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now
Laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smokes gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them
And I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
And yet today
My love has flown away
And I'm without my love
Now
Laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smokes gets in your eyes
