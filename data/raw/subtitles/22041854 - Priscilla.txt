I'm Terry West.
What's your name?
Priscilla Beaulieu.
I see you come in here a lot.
Is your family stationed here?
Yes.
Where are you from?
Uh, Texas.
My dad just transferred here
in August.
That so?
Well, how do you like Germany?
Mmm.
I book the entertainment here.
My wife plays here sometimes.
Neat.
Do you like Elvis Presley?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course. Who doesn't?
Well, I'm a friend of his.
My wife and I go to his house
when he has people over.
He's always glad to see
folks from back home.
We're going this weekend,

Have to ask my parents.
