All right. What do you say, fellas?
We're closin' up.
Wait a minute.
We ain't finished yet.
Now, come on, boys.
Be nice?
I told you we were closing up
20 minutes ago.
You touch that switch,
and I'll tear your arm off.
Charlie, you better leave number five.
Okay, that's it?
What are you closing up so early for?
And where the hell is everybody?
Where the hell is everybody?
Yeah.
Everybody's home in bed.
That's where you should be.
Yeah?
With who?
Thanks, but I'm no good at that.
You think I'm kiddin'?
Nah.
Man, look at this.
Like a graveyard?
What do you want to do, man?
You got any money?
Are you kiddin'?
So what do you want to do?
Don't ask, man.
Something. Anything.
You name it.
All right.
No, man. I'm uptight.
Come on now.
Come on!
Nothin'.
Hey, Mac, where ya goin'?
Hey, dig them binoculars, baby?
- What are you doing tonight, sweetheart?
- Where ya goin', Mac?
Hey, wait a second, man.
Hey, Mac, where ya goin'?
Wait a second.
Hey, baby!
Hey, how about some swell muscatel?
Don't be offended, baby.
I dig your jugs, that's all.
Swell muscatel.
Where ya goin', Mac?
Come on!
Man.
Don't tell me this guy's closed.
Great.
Dig, man.
What?
It's Sunday.
Hey, Joe.
What?
Let's get us a pigeon.
No.
No, come on, man.
What do you say?
Are you really itchin'?
Baby, all over.
Yeah? Yeah! Man, I'm
goin' through the roof.
I mean it.
You're really itching?
Come on, man.
Let's scratch.
Right here, baby. Look.
No.
What?
No, no, no.
Over there.
Come on. Over there.
Come on.
Perfect.
Anything?
Nothing.
I hope we bust a cat with big
bread tonight, man.
I wanna go to the track tomorrow.
Your mama's gonna
let you go to the track?
Hey, Artie.
Which do you dig more, pigeons or broads?
Man, don't ask me that.
I dig 'em both.
Why? Which do you dig more?
I dig broads.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You don't dig pigeons, Joe? I dig
pigeons, but I dig broads more.
- I dig 'em both.
- I'm just saying.
What's up?
Couple of guys, but a car's coming.
Forget it.
You know?
Why do you dig 'em both, Artie?
Why do you dig 'em both?
I don't know, man.
They both go up my neck,
like my back was burning, you know?
Like I can't see nothin' else.
They both make me feel good all over.
Anybody ever tell you
you were a little nuts, Artie?
Yeah, they told me.
Yeah. Well, don't believe 'em.
- No?
- No.
You're a lot nuts.
You really think so, Joe?
Here he comes.
Let me have him, Joe.
Let me have him.
Please?
One yell outta you, and you get
this lollipop right in the ear, man.
You're choking me. Yeah?
How'd you figure that out?
Please. I'll give you my money.
Ain't that nice, Joe?
He's gonna give us his money.
Eight bucks.
Eight lousy bucks!
Eight bucks?
You gotta be kidding, mister.
That's all I have. So how
come that's all you have?
Please. I'm a poor man.
So how come you're a poor man?
Maybe you don't work hard enough?
Yeah, maybe you're just
a lazy, good-for-nothing slob.
You call this fair?
All this work for a lousy eight bucks?
Please.
Don't hurt me. I got a family.
Yeah?
If this is all you come home with,
maybe they'd be gettin' a break
if you didn't come home no more?
Crap. Nothin' but crap.
You know, you're what
I call real pathetic, mister.
Please, I beg of you.
Yeah, but you didn't say
“pretty please.”
Please.
You still
didn't say “pretty please.”
Pretty... please.
See? That's all you had to do.
Wasn't that easy enough?
Eight bucks.
You stink.
You stink. I could have
laid him out with one shot.
It's more fun this way.
Keeps you in shape.
Come on.
So, what do you want to do
with eight bucks, man?
So, what do you want to do?
Man, I gotta fly tonight.
I mean, I really gotta fly.
You want more kicks?
Man, I ain't even warmed up yet.
Let's go down to Times Square.
What's down on Times Square
on a Sunday night, man?
So, who knows, man?
The night's young yet.
I guess you know it's 2:00 in the morning.
I'm sorry, honey.
Why couldn't you make a move
to leave there earlier?
Honey, you know how mother is.
She wanted to have
this birthday party for Susie.
I know.
And she's all alone now, Bill.
I know, but it's 2:00 in the morning,
and she's four years old.
We won't get home till 3:30.
I've gotta get up at 7:00,
so I start the week
with a big, fat three
and a half hours' sleep.
It may not mean anything to you,
but I happen to be a workingman.
Look, why don't we
take a cab then? Taxi!
A cab? All the way to Flushing?
Who do you think's gonna pay for it?
Well, it won't hurt us one night, Bill.
One night? That's how it starts.
Then it'll be another night
and another night.
That's not in the budget, Helen.
You should have
married a millionaire. A cab!
Well, look, do you want me
to pay for it? Sure.
Then at the end of the month,
when you run out of money,
who do you think's gonna pay for it then?
Go ahead, cabbie. Go ahead.
Bill, please!
Helen, you kill me.
I'm telling you. A cab.
Come on, Helen. Helen!
A cab.
What are you fussing for?
Come on. No.
Why not? Tony, there's
people here who can see us.
Hey, blow, will ya?
Come on! Blow!
Come on. Why not? Tony, I
think you've got the wrong idea.
Yeah? I think you got the wrong idea.
Tony, you got a lot of girlfriends.
So?
I'm sure they all like you.
Why not? There's nothin' wrong with me.
I take good care of them.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I make 'em happy.
I'm a firm believer in happiness.
Some people are afraid to be happy.
You know that?
Some people are
actually afraid to be happy.
You know what happens
to people like that?
What?
They stay home.
Tony, if you don't want to take me home,
I can get home by myself.
Who said anything
about not taking you home?
I'll take you home. Come on.
Let's not miss the train?
All right.
Hey! How come you gotta be home so early?
Hey, wait for me?
Early? Are you kidding?
I have to go to work in the morning.
Don't you have to work?
Sure. So what?
I could do that job in the A&P
with my eyes closed.
Who needs sleep?
Good night, Son.
Tell Irma it was a wonderful dinner.
Good night, Mom. Safe home.
You too.
Be careful on the stairs.
Bye, Dad.
Sam!
You couldn't even say good night?
He drove us down to the station.
A bum, that's all. A rotten bum.
Don't tell me no.
Nobody can tell you anything.
Yeah. What did I ask him for, a million?
I asked him for a lousy 500 bucks
just to get my teeth fixed
so I can eat like a human being.
I ain't entitled to that?
You mean to tell me he can't afford it?
I don't know can he afford it.
He's got his own problems.
What problems?
He's got a good job, ain't he?
He's got a nice apartment.
He's got a nice wife. He's got nice kids.
He's young!
What problems, for cryin' out loud?
He drops more than that
at the track in a month, for God's sake.
You better save your breath
for them steps. You're gonna need it.
For this I get treated like an old dog.
I don't hear a word you say.
From a stranger I can get more dignity
than I got from him tonight.
Believe me, Bertha,
we ain't goin' back there anymore.
Believe me, the next time
he wants a babysitter, let him hire.
No more free service.
Yeah?
I work for my grandchildren for free.
I don't belong to no union.
He wants to use the children
as a weapon over us.
Let him. I'm finished.
You watch your blood pressure.
And besides, you're not being fair.
I'm not being fair?
And this is when he win
the certificate of merit in Latin.
That's too-
He was only 13 years old then.
Yeah?
And this-
What's that?
Was the Y.M.C.A.
Come on, Pop.
He doesn't wanna see all this stuff.
- Have some coffee.
- Hey, what's the matter? You no proud?
I'm proud.
Hey, come on.
Hey, we've really got to go, Mom.
He's got to get to the bus terminal.
I'll get your coat.
Hey, come on, buddy. VVe're gonna be late.
That was a good dinner.
Mom, I'll see you next week, okay?
Thank you, Mr. Carmatti.
So long, Pop.
That's good wine you got there.
So long, Pop.
Good-bye, Son.
And be very careful, you hear?
Don't break your arm.
Bye, Mr. Carmatti, Mrs. Carmatti.
Thank you kindly for everything.
You're very, very welcome.
You good boy. You come anytime.
Anytime.
Thank you, Pop. The hat.
The hat. Sure.
Thank you. Good-bye, Morn.
See you next week.
Good-bye, Son.
That was a great conversation
you and your mother had tonight.
It'd be just wonderful
to have another child.
Helen, you gotta be outta your head.
Well, no. It's just
that Susie's four years old now-
You know Susie, bless her heart,
was an accident.
Daddy, what's an accident?
N-nothing, nothing.
Nothing, honey. Nothing.
Nothing.
Bill.
Bill!
Well?
What does that mean?
Does that mean
we'll never have another child?
I'd really like to know.
I don't know, Helen.
Boy, when you add it all up-
I got a responsibility to you,
to Susie, to your mother,
to my mother and father.
I've only got two hands, Helen.
I've only got two hands.
You gave her a pill?
What?
You gave her a pill?
No.
You know she gets train sick.
Bill, she's asleep now.
Besides, I don't think she'll get sick.
We have to try it sometime anyway.
If we miss the train at this time,
we'll have to wait a half hour.
Hey, don't sweat it, kid.
You're with me.
You're with Tony Goya.
I'll get you home, baby.
There's nobody around.
I'm taking you home. What do you say?
No. Tony, come on.
Come on.
No. Please, no. Don't.
Hey! What is it with you?
Who you savin' it for?
Nobody.
Then what? What are you trying to do,
make a monkey outta me?
If I knew it was gonna be like this,
I wouldn't have even called you.
Let me tell you something, girlie.
You want to get along,
you better grow up, and fast.
Yeah, come on.
Tony.
Tony. Nah, don't bug me.
What do you want?
Tony, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah.
You're sorry. Me too.
Tony, I don't have to grow up.
You don't have to grow up?
You're all the way there, right?
You got a long way to go.
Long way to go, baby. Long way to go.
Come on. Take a walk, will ya?
I'm a big girl, Tony.
Yeah, sure.
Come on, lay off, will ya?
Hey.
Try me.
I'll try you.
I was right?
Come on. Say it?
Yeah?
Let's go. Come on.
What are you lookin' at?
If I knew it was gonna be like this,
I'd have gotten some dough
and rented a car.
Next time?
Would you like that?
In my day, when an old man needed help,
the kids came running, believe me.
It was demanded.
That's enough. I'm tired.
Because when a father comes to the end,
he deserves a reward.
He's entitled.
Sit there.
What for?
Come on.
Another bum.
His father must be proud of him too.
No, wait a minute. Let me finish.
We just happened to be going
by this Lincoln dealer, you see,
when Claire says,
“Why don't we stop by and take a look?”
Well, idiot me.
I don't even suspect.
I mean, what's the harm to look, right?
I figure if she thinks that I'm gonna
put out $6,000 for a Lincoln Continental,
she's out of her cotton-pickin' mind.
Where you going? What? You gotta go?
Wait just a sec. Let me finish.
What happened-Would you believe
I couldn't get her
out of the car until I bought it.
Couldn't get her out of the car!
Come on. Let's-
Good night, everybody.
You too?
Yes, it's late.
Let me go get your things.
- That sure sounds like her.
- She's-
This party has really been a ball.
We've been having such a wonderful time.
Now, listen, you two.
Don't you be strangers.
No, we won't. Will we, dear?
A wonderful party, Jerry.
Well, take care. Maybe we can have
a ride in that Lincoln sometime.
Hey, how 'bout that? Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey, wait. Are you sure now this train
is gonna take us to Grand Central?
Yeah. About a 30-minute ride
down to Grand Central,
then a shuttle over to Times Square
and the bus station.
Igotanidea.
What's that?
I'll trade you my weekend pass-
For your 30-day sick leave.
No, thanks. No, thanks.
I'll tell you one thing, old buddy.
You're looking at
a well-fed man tonight. Yes, sir.
I'll tell you one thing
I never did have, though, is that,
before is that, “lasana”?
No.Lasagna.
Lasagna.
Lasagna.
Yeah, that was good stuff.
Yeah.
You sure got a nice family, Phil.
Thanks, Felix.
I'm glad you like 'em.
I like your daddy too.
He's a nice, warm man.
Yeah, he's a character, isn't he?
God.
Were you able to understand him?
I understood him all right.
The question is, does he understand me?
I think they were a little shocked
when they saw that arm of yours.
Yeah, I know they were. Yeah.
They sure worry about you
quite a bit, don't they?
Yeah.
Yeah, they're always worrying about me.
Hey, you don't have any folks,
do you, Felix?
No. No. They,
They died when I was small.
I'm sorry.
Nah. Yeah.
I really don't even remember
too much about 'em.
What are you gonna do
when you get out of the army?
I don't know.
I guess work on a farm,
maybe a filling station.
I don't know. Heck, I ain't got
no special plans. How about you?
I can hardly wait to get out.
I'm gonna go back to school,
and then I'm gonna go to law school.
And then 50,000 a year, maybe
100,000 a year. Fifty-
Come on.
Maybe more.
You're sounding kind
of ambitious there, ain't you, old buddy?
Come on. Let's go.
Hey, Felix.
This way. Come on.
Come on. This door. Ain't nothin'
wrong with this door down here.
Come on. I can't hold it all day.
Get in here.
What was wrong with the door
down at the other end of the car?
What, the last door?
Yeah.
Last door never opens up here.
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not used
to these things, you know.
Hey, what bus are you taking?
Hey, Felix?
What bus are you taking?
How you getting home?
Yeah.
Let's see.
Here. I guess I take
this here milk run at 3:15.
That'll get me into St. Louis.
And then I ought to be able to get
headed on something down south there.
Tell me. When he was a kid, I didn't
give him to eat from my own mouth?
I didn't do that? How many
times have you told me?
I didn't take the clothes from my back
and put it on him?
I didn't see to it
that he got an education?
What am I, someone from off the streets?
For God's sake.
I'm counting.
Want another?
Which one of you girls
is gonna take me home tonight?
What's wrong with that?
Come on!
Hey, did you order your drinks yet?
Yeah, I was just gonna order.
Say, banendefl Yeah?
How about a couple of scotches down here?
A little water.
That sure is a tester!
He puts a little spit on the ball.
That's what he was doing.
I saw him spitting on the ball.
He was spitting.
It was the only way he could beat me.
He gets the ball.
I don't agree.
He's got a grip on it. Listen now.
He's got the mitt.
The mitt's gonna work.
Sure, the mitt's gonna work
as long as this guy's spitting on it.
What Will it be?
Glass of water.
He gets the ball, winds up. Pop.
Thanks.
It's all in the fingers.
It's not in the windup.
Let me show you.
He gets the ball. He winds up.
He grips the ball, throws it. Away!
The rubber!
He was forgetting to toe the rubber.
It happens to be... a rule
in the National League.
You must toe the rubber.
Excuse me.
No towels.
There's never a-No, thanks.
All right. What did I do now?
Nothing.
That's the trouble.
I suppose eventually you'll get around
to telling me what that means.
Do you know how much money
Jerry makes a year?
Do you?
No, ldon1,andlH.
Am not really interested.
He makes...
$18,500 a year.
Good.
Let's give him an A-plus, shall we?
Did you notice the clothes
those women wore?
Look, Muriel,
if I had known that you were going
to carry on in this fashion,
I never would have gone to that party.
Why not, honey?
They're our old friends.
We haven't seen them in years.
What's the matter?
You afraid I just might open my eyes
and see what the rest
of the world's been doing while you-
Look, Muriel,
for the 99th time, I'm no hero. I'll-
I'm not a big money maker.
You can say that again.
I never will be.
What, are you proud of it? 'm just
saying I I'll never make history.
I'll just teach it.
I'm-I'm a schoolteacher. That's-
I've got a little place in this world
that's good enough for me.
Now, you've had 15 years
to get used to that idea.
If you could just-
just accept that, Muriel,
I think-I think I could be a happy man.
I think you could be a happy woman.
Let's not have any speeches.
I've heard that all before.
You're not kidding it's the 99th time.
What else can I do?
Someday I'll draw you a diagram.
Do you know there wasn't
a woman there tonight
that didn't have at least three children.
Well...
I went to the doctor,
and he said I was all right.
What?
I said, I went to the doctor,
and he said I was all right.
So he said.
He should pay us a visit some night.
So what'd you give me
such a hard time for?
Fred? This is Doug.
Yeah. You just get in?
Because I've been
calling you since midnight.
How was the party?
Yeah.
Was he there?
Well-
Well, did you get a chance to talk to him?
Yeah?
And?
He Will?
He's really willing
to give me a chance?
Tomorrow morning?
How am I supposed to-
How am I possibly even gonna pay for it?
I haven't had a drop for eight months.
I'm dry.
I'm completely dry.
Fred, have a heart, will you?
Fred.
I want my wife back.
I want my family back.
No.
No, I'm all right. I-
I'll be there, Fred. Don't worry.
I'm going right home and right to bed.
Yeah. Fred, I-
I could kiss your feet for this.
I don't know how to begin to thank you.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you in the morning.
Thanks a million, Fred.
Good night.
I'm sorry.
Do you have the time?
Excuse me. Do you-
Do you have the time?
There was a clock in that bar.
What?
There's a clock right over there
by that change booth.
In the bar, yeah.
We were drinking in the same bar.
What do you want?
I just wanted-Are you going downtown?
I thought maybe-
Go on. Beat it.
We could-Beatfl!
Wait a minute. I-
Go on!
Okay. I'm s-
Look, I-
Go on!
I didn't-
Hey, what do you say?
Say, we're in a hurry, jack.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
You'll live longer.
Hey, you. The train may be coming.
Do you mind?
There's plenty of time.
Plenty of time.
How many?
How many, fella? Two?
Yeah, two, buddy.
You see anybody else out here?
Hey, what's the idea, mister?
VVhat's the matter? You pushed
one of them on the floor.
Sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry too, so how about
coming out here and pickin' it up?
Come on, will ya, fella?
You heard me.
I said come out here and pick it up.
Look, I said I was sorry.
Well, I'm not picking it up.
All right, so don't pick it up.
Listen, you come out here and pick it up,
or you give me my money back.
Joan, don't pick it up.
Arnold, please.
I said don't touch it. Darling,
it is not all that important.
It's important to me. You know,
you're looking for trouble,
and one of these days
you're gonna get it.
Joan!
You step out of that booth,
and I'll knock that grin off your face.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, you stinkin' garbage!
You've got some nerve, buster!
You damn right I got some nerve.
If I ever see you again,
I'll bust you wide open!
Yeah, sure! Sure!
Garbage! Garbage!
What did you pick it up for?
What's the difference?
He threw it on the floor, didn't he?
Come on.
You know what's wrong with you?
You don't know how to enjoy life.
I don't know how to enjoy life.
No, you don't.
You have to be an imbecile not to worry.
Keep your voice down.
Boy, if you knew the times
I'm wide awake, 3:00 in the morning,
and there you are, sleeping like a baby.
What are you talking?
What'd I say?
Of course the old help the young.
Did I say no?
But then after,
the young must help the old.
Must! If they don't, who will?
That's right.
I don't know.
But today, these kids-
I should live so long.
Look, whose side are you on?
Mine or whitey's?
I'm not gonna even answer that.
But being your wife
does not change the fact
that there is a right way to do things
and there is a wrong way.
Go lecture them home-relief bums
you take care of.
Don't try whitey's
stupid social work on me.
There is nothing stupid
about social work.
Yeah, I know all about it.
You and whitey sitting down together
sipping tea, talking about,
“What are we gonna do
about them poor colored folk up there?”
If that ain't a crock.
And I ain't nonviolent either,
so don't try draggin' me
to another one of them
damn discussions like tonight.
If you had only had the courtesy
to wait until he was finished,
Wait? and then if you
had any questions-
That's all he talked about-wait.
“Just wait, brothers and sisters.
The next hundred years is gonna be
a whole lot easier for us colored folk.
All we got to do is sit and wait,
wait on the Lord and shout hallelujah.”
Now, Arnold, you know
he didn't say anything like that,
but what he did say
makes a whole lot more sense
than that stuff you pulled down there
in that change booth.
I ain't lettin' no white man walk on me.
You proved that, all right.
I ain't letting 'em walk on me,
and that's why they hate my guts,
and I hate 'em right back-all of 'em.
In the army, we used to sing “Praise
the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,”
and that's what
we ought to be singing now.
Not them hymns.
We ought to hit 'em first
and hit 'em hard
and reeducate them later.
No.
Not us. Them!
Arnold. Arnold.
Things are so changing, and you know it.
Not much, maybe, but...
these things take time.
- You've gotta give 'em a chance.
- Wait?
That's what you're talkin' about-Wait.
Well, I got news for you, baby.
We ain't got time to wait.
You can march, and you can picket,
and you can legislate
from here to hell and back,
but you'll never see the day.
We in a war, baby,
and when you in a war, you gotta fight.
When you want changes,
you gotta spill blood.
Any white man look at me cross-eyed,
and he's got a one-way ticket
to the graveyard.
You don't mean that.
You don't mean that, 'cause...
they'd shoot you down.
Well, if I can take care
of a few of them in the meantime,
that's all I want.
That's all I want.
There's your white man for you.
He could have been black,
honey, just as well.
Yeah, but he ain't.
Hey, son. Hey.
Listen,
When you get to be a great big lawyer,
you gonna remember old Felix?
Why, sure, son. How could I forget?
No, no, no.
Wait a second now.
I'm being serious with you now.
Now, I just, I was just wondering-
Maybe I ought to get your autograph
while the getting's good.
You know,
so I can look at it on rainy days.
Have you got a pen? A pencil?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
All right.
I'm gonna treasure this.
Right here on my cast.
Right there.
Thank you so much.
Well, why did he get fired?
I don't know why.
Just that he got fired, that's all.
It could happen to anybody.
It could happen to me.
Why-
Why can't you understand that?
Bill, I don't want to argue with you.
What do you want me to do?
I don't want you to do anything.
I'd just like you to worry for a change.
I wish-I didn't hear you.
I said I wish we could go somewhere.
See what I mean?
Make one person happy.
Next time, baby.
Next time we'll go somewhere.
I guarantee.
Come on!
Come on!
Whee!
God!
Man! This ride is slow.
Like, I mean slow!
So get out and push.
I ain't gonna get out and push, man.
Then shut up!
Hey!
Let's go, man! Let's go!
Hey, Joe!
Hey, who's that? Your father?
No, man!
That ain't my father, man.
That's your father.
Hey, wake him up.
Hey, Pop, wake up.
Pop!
Happy New Year!
Do you see that?
That's what you find
when you're out at 2:00 in the morning.
Bill, I wanted to take a cab.
This cat's like dead.
CNLrnan. You don't know
how to do it.
Give him a match and he'll wake up.
Right. Hey, bum, you want a hotfoot?
Burn, you want a hotfoot?
Why can't they leave him alone?
Why can't they leave him alone?
No, man. This cat needs a bomb.
What are they doing to him, Tony?
It's nothing.
He's just a bum. It's nothing.
Hey, fella!
Hey, fella!
- You talkin' to me?
- Why don't you leave him alone?
Me? I ain't doin' nothin', man.
He's not bothering you.
So? I'm not bothering him.
- Then why don't you leave him alone?
- He a friend of yours, mister?
Hey, mister, I'm talkin' to you.
He a friend of yours?
No, he's not a friend of mine.
So what's it to ya?
I mean, like, who asked you?
Just what's the point?
I don't know. You tell me.
What's the point?
A man could get hurt that way.
You know that.
No, I don't know that. Do you know that?
Hey, what are you, a-a doctor?
Hey, you wanna make a speech
about it, mister?
Go ahead. I'm listening.
Make a speech.
Speech! Speech!
Go ahead. Make a speech.
I don't want to make any speech.
Why don't you just leave him alone?
Let him sleep it off.
He's not bothering anybody.
He's got enough troubles.
Yeah?
How do you know so much
about his troubles?
He must be a friend of yours.
Hey, Artie.
Better cut it out.
This guy's a friend of his.
Yeah? No kiddin'.
Hey, let me ask you a question, mister.
How do you know he's sleepin' it off?
How do you know he ain't dead?
I mean, how do you know he ain't dead?
You saw him move.
You know he isn't dead.
Yeah, I saw him move,
but how do you know that wasn't a twitch?
Dead man's twitch.
Hey, did ya ever hear of that?
Dead man's twitch?
You know about everything else.
You don't know about a dead man's twitch?
Come on. Talk to me.
I mean, you started it,
so you talk to me.
Forget it.
Forget it?
Hey, how do you like this guy?
Puts his big nose in,
and then he says forget it.
Hey, Artie.
I guess it's okay now.
They ain't friends no more.
Yeah? Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.
How about you?
He a friend of yours?
You?
He a friend of yours?
Do it again?
No.
No, don't do it.
Please?
Nothing.
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
No. You don't want to see
him get hurt, do you?
Nah. Neither do I. I wouldn't hurt him.
Don't be afraid.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
You got a cigarette?
Yeah.
Could I burn a cigarette from you?
Please.
Thank you.
Move over.
Move over a little bit.
Thank you.
Listen, what's your name?
Ken.
Kenneth?
I'm Artie.
I fell on the subway coming up the steps.
Well, thank you very much.
I couldn't do that with my left hand.
Listen, can I talk to you?
All right.
Come here a second.
Can you help me?
I'm in serious trouble.
Can you help me?
What's the matter?
This guy I'm with-
He's real buggy, you know?
Act natural and-
Go on, now.
He's got a knife.
Please help me.
He does?
Yes.
And then maybe we could-we could make
a run for it together, you and me.
I gotta get away from him.
Can you help me?
You don't seem like him at all.
Really?
You seem different, I think.
Thank you very much.
I'm glad you said that.
Look, maybe when we get off,
we could go someplace,
maybe to a movie or something.
I just wanna talk to you. Please.
All right.
Could we?
All right.
Good. Thank you.
Do you trust me?
Yes.
Do you?
I think so.
Good.
I'm gonna have
to rough you up a little bit.
I won't hurt you. Just for his sake, okay?
What do you mean?
Now, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm just gonna play.
You gotta play along with me, okay?
Could you do that?
I'll try.
I won't hurt you.
I won't hurt you. Don't worry.
I don't know.
What?
But you're pulling. You're-
I won't hurt you.
You're pulling my neck.
I'm not hurting you.
Don't worry. I promise you.
But you're hurting-
I'm not hurting you.
Please. Don't.
You rotten fag!
You make me wanna puke!
This is terrible.
Where's the conductor, for heaven's sake?
He's probably a couple of cars up.
They usually ride
in the middle of the train.
Hey, no!
Come here, man.
No, that's a girlfriend.
Why are they doing that?
Looks like they got hold of a queer.
Hey. Hey, is he hurting you, fella?
Hey, fella. Fella, is
he hurting you? Yes.
Artie-He's hurting my arm.
Artie, you're hurting his arm.
Letgo. He's hurting me.
Want me to tell him to let go?
Please.
Let go, Artie. Artie. Artie.
Come on.
Let go of his arm. Let go!
Let go, Artie.
That better?
Yes.
Sit down, Artie.
Go on.
You shouldn't hurt a fella like that.
Don't laugh at him.
Fella sittin' on a train,
you don't hurt him like that.
That's not very nice.
Go on. Sit down, man.
I bet you're all upset, aren't you?
You all upset?
No.
Arm hurt a little bit?
Hey. Hey, that's
a nice watch you got there.
I said it's a very nice-
Relax.
Relax. I said it's a very nice
watch you got there. Thank you.
Hey, can I look at it?
Thanks.
No, I just wanna look at it.
A very nice watch.
It's a very nice watch.
It's a present. Please.
You're giving me it for a present.
No.
That's very nice.
What a pretty shirt, buddy.
Hey, tell me where you buy your shirts.
Where do you buy your shirts?
Where do you buy your shirts?
You like that?
You like that?
No.
- You don't?
- Rape! Rape!
Is that better? You like that?
Please let me have my watch.
I'll give you back your watch,
but I just wanna see what
the label says on your shirt.
What are doing
in that corner, you dirty thing?
I wanna see where you got that shirt.
What do you wanna get up for, old fella?
You wanna have a little fun?
You wanna go for
a little walk or something?
Help me!
Come quick!
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a draft dodger.
That ain't your station.
You shouldn't have done that, fella.
Hey, son, this go on all the time?
Nah. They're just a couple of maniacs.
I'm sorry you had to see this, Felix.
Don't let it bother you.
It don't bother me none, son.
This ain't my town.
This part of it isn't my town either.
Wanna dance down the aisle?
Come on, fella.
Dance down the aisle. Come on.
Dance down the aisle.
Help me. Help me.
Please. You don't know me.
Please help me. Help.
Get down, buddy!
Hey, Artie.
Show him back to his seat.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Attagirl.
Come on.
Come on, princess.
You've been a naughty girl.
You gotta sit in the corner.
Hey, you, you bum! Stop that!
I'll call the police!
There are decent people here!
You-You scum!
He shouldn't have done that,
sweetheart. Not that.
What did you call me, mister?
He just got excited.
Please, sit down, Sam. Sit down.
Leave me alone.
Please, Sam!
You better sit down, Pop,
before I spit on you.
He's an old man, and he-!
Sit down, Sam. They'll kill you.
That's right, lady.
And you better stay down, Pop,
before you give her a stroke.
Don't you get fresh with me.
Fresh?
You're lucky.
You're lucky I don't kick your teeth in
for calling me that.
Yeah? We'll see about that.
Why?
You're gonna do something, Pop?
Never mind what I'll do. Just don't think
you can get away with everything.
Why don't you grow up
and behave yourself, for heaven's sake?
Where do you think you are?
There are decent people here!
I'll call the police.
Yeah?
Don't worry.
I ain't worried.
Don't be so smart.
I'll call 'em.
Go ahead and call 'em.
I ain't stoppin' ya.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You want me to call 'em for you?
I'll call 'em for you.
Hey, police.
Hey, police!
It's okay.
How's that?
- Hey, Artie.
- Yeah.
Hey, Artie, you wanna call
the police too? Yeah.
Go ahead.
Hey, police!
See? All you gotta do is ask.
Anything else that I can do for you, Pop?
You, you're his age.
Why don't you stand up and do something?
What are you getting on my back for?
You, you're a disgrace.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Self. Self.
That's all you think-like animals.
Sam, for heaven's sake.
They're one of a kind.
He even sounds like them.
That's right, Pop.
We're brothers.
We understand each other, right?
I mean,
you don't feel like standing up, do you?
Look, I don't know nothin', Mac.
I didn't see nothin'.
See that, Pop?
He's too busy.
He's got his girlfriend. Right?
That your girlfriend, pal?
What's the matter, pal?
I'm just askin'. That your girlfriend?
Yeah.
Yeah?
You his girlfriend?
Not bad, pal.
Not bad at all.
Hey, Artie.
Yeah.
You wanna see a real doll?
Better than the princess even.
Come on.
Nobody's better than the princess.
Want a drink, pal?
No, thanks.
How about you, girlfriend?
Just to get in the mood.
Look, what do you say?
We're not bothering you, right?
No, no, you're not bothering me.
I'm just trying to be friendly,
that's all.
I mean, we understand each other, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Sure. That's what I thought.
How is she?
Look, why don't you just-
I mean, take it easy, Mac?
What's the matter?
Now, take it easy.
I ain't doing nothin'.
I'm just askin'.
See, what I wanna know, Mac,
is what's she like in the sack.
Look-
Hey, she's a nice girl?
Yeah?
So how come she's with you?
I mean, as long as you're
nuzzlin' her on the subway,
I figure anything goes, right?
Ain't that right, honey?
And if you're lookin'
for some extra action,
you can always come with me and my buddy.
I mean, if you're really looking
for a workout, you know?
You gonna say something, Mac?
I see you go for the strong,
silent' type, honey.
Honey.
Well, if you change your mind,
give me a call.
Name's Joe Ferrone.
Look it up.
I'll know what to do with you.
I'll know what to do with ya!
Joe!
How about you, mister?
Feel like a drink?
Come on, honey.
Here's where we get off.
I wanna stay and see this.
Are you crazy?
I wanna watch. I gotta see 'em.
The car's going to 86th.
86th! Hey, what's the idea?
All aboard!
Go to your room.
How 'bout you?
Want a drink?
Hey, come on.
No hard feelings.
I want some, Joe.
This cat's still out.
How about a drink, General?
No, thanks.
What's the matter?
Don't they drink in the army no more?
Yeah, they drink.
So have a drink.
No, thanks.
Boy! Some army we got.
If you're in the army, General, I'm
glad I ain't in it. Yeah, me too.
To tell you the truth, son,
I'm kind of glad myself.
No, no. Wait. Now-
Hey, why don't you boys
just settle down now?
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, you had your fun.
Why don't y'all stop rockin'
the boat for a while?
Well, I ain't rockin' no boat.
Hey. Hey, you rockin' a boat?
No, man.
I ain't rockin' no boat.
Don't mess with them, Felix.
I ain't messin' with 'em.
Where you from,
soldier boy? Me?
Yeah.
I'm from Oklahoma.
- Is that supposed to be a big deal?
- No, not especially.
Is that uniform
supposed to be a big deal?
No, not especially.
Is it supposed to mean you're
better than us or something?
I mean, like your feet don't stink?
No, I don't think
we're better than you, son.
No.
However,
I do think we're a little quieter.
Hey, what do they call you all back home?
Look, they're just looking
for a fight-Well-NO,
I'll tell you, son.
My name's Teflinger.
And my friends call me Felix.
Felix?
Yeah, I guess y'all can have
some fun with that now?
- You kiddin'.
- You mean like Felix the Cat?
Yeah, I guess so.
Hey, man, you're too much, you know that?
Hey, they teach you
how to fight in the army?
Yeah, they teach us how to fight.
Yeah?
Well, it looks like you didn't
make out too good?
Yeah, it sure looks that way, don't it?
I mean, you look kind of lopsided.
I can fix that for you.
Yeah.
Even it out, you know.
I bet you could. Yeah.
I tell you though.
I kind of like it this way.
Yeah?
Yeah.
They teach you
how to be tough in the army?
Yeah, I guess so.
I mean, are you a tough guy now?
No. I ain't too tough.
I'm the peaceful type, son.
What are you supposed to do
if, somebody, like, throw
something at ya-like the enemy?
What are you supposed to do?
Throws what?
I don't know. Anything. Like this.
What are you supposed to do, duck?
What are you trying to do, kill somebody?
I missed him, didn't I?
Come on, soldier boy.
Show me what you're supposed to do.
Show me how tough you are.
You two against us two.
- Just for laughs. What do you say?
- Man.
That cracker ain't used to this
at all, at all.
I'd like to accommodate you, son.
But I got a busted wing here.
One hand behind my back.
What do you say?
No, thanks.
What are you, yellow?
No.
No, I just know you can beat me
to a pulp either way.
Yeah, I know it,
and you know it, don't you?
So what'll it prove? Hey, you're
stinkin' well told you know it.
That's what I said.
You know, I don't like you.
I don't like the way you talk.
I don't like nothin' about you.
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to grind you up.
So don't talk to me no more.
Yeah, but you don't understand-
Keep your stinkin' mouth shut.
Yeah, but if you-Shut up!
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.
Come.
No, no, Sam.
No. I'm afraid.
Bill, let's get off this train.
Let's get off.
We can't get off. It's too obvious.
What?
It's too obvious.
But, Sam, that door won't work.
No. Sam-
Where you going, Pop?
Please, we have to get off.
Where you going?
Please, we have to get off.
What for?
What do you wanna get off for?
Look out. The door is open.
Stop it.
Please, let me out! What door, Pop?
I don't see no door.
Hold the door! We wanna get off!
What are you talking about?
There's a door right over there.
You mean this door, Pop?
Why didn't you say so?
I didn't know you meant this door.
Enough is enough.
You can have the train to yourself.
We want to get off.
You wanna get off.
Why didn't you say so?
I tell you what.
We'll even hold the door for you, Pop.
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
He's jamming the door.
I want to get off.
It's stuck, man!
No! No!!
No! No!!
Sit down, Sammy.
Did he hurt you?
That's right, Sammy.
You better sit down
before you're falling down.
How long do you think you
can keep us locked up in this car?
I don't know, Pop.
We got all night.
Who you lookin' at, mister?
You wanna make another speech?
Speech! Speech!
Anybody else wanna try?
Hey, anybody else wanna try?
And the train stops
in the middle of nowhere, and then what?
Hey, no talking in the classroom.
Look, there are just a couple of stops
till we get to Grand Central.
- There are bound to be some cops there.
- Hey, Felix!
Hey, Felix, just for that,
you're gonna have to stay after school.
You know what
they can do to you for this?
Yeah. Yeah, sure, Pop. I know.
All right. Who's got the cards?
I mean until the cops come?
All right, who's got the cards?
Nobody? Ain't nobody
got no cards? A deck of cards.
Hey, you got some cards?
How about you? How about you?
You got some cards in here?
No cards?
Who's got the cards?
I mean, ain't nobody got no cards?
Hey, about you?
You got some cards?
I Wish I did.
How about some dice?
You got any dice?
Can't help you.
Shure nuf'.
Sure enough.
What are you - What are you grinnin' at?
Nothing. I'm with you, jack.
You're with me?
That's right.
Why?
What do you mean you're with me?
Just what I said.
Anything you wanna do
is okay with me. Yeah?
You wanna knock some heads together,
you just go ahead.
It's okay with me.
Yeah?
Sure.
You wanna know something, buddy?
I wouldn't have you with me
if you were the last man.
You know that?
I'd rather have a dead dog
with me than you.
Okay. You do what you wanna do.
Yeah?
You know why? You wanna know why?
'Cause I don't like black.
What do you think of that?
Okay. You made your point.
No, no.
No, no, you started shootin'
your mouth off.
I didn't make no point.
I just wanna tell you I don't like black.
Because black's like dirt, you know?
I mean, it, like, smells.
What's the matter?
Don't you believe me?
Don't you believe it smells, jack?
Ask anybody. They'll tell ya.
Go ahead. Ask them!
They'll tell ya.
You probably can't smell it no more.
I can smell it from there.
It's what they call nigger smell.
Don't mess with me.
Did you hear that, jack?
Nigger smell.
I said don't mess with me.
Don't you believe me, jack?
Nigger smell?
I said don't mess with me! She probably
can't smell it no more either.
You can't smell it.
She can't smell it.
- I said don't mess with me!
- No, Arnold!
No, Arnold!
Nigger smell!
Don't!
You stink, nigger.
Stop it! Arnold! Arnold, please!
She's with him, but you're with me.
Right, jack?
- Arnold, don't! Don't hit him, Arnold!
- You're with me.
Arnold!
Right? She's with him.
Arnold, it's not worth it. Not worth it.
She's with him.
You're with me, nigger.
She's with him.
- She's with him, but you're with me.
- Don't hit him!
Arnold!
Nigger.
It's not worth it!
She's with him, but you're with me.
Stop, man, or I'll break her arm!
No. It's not worth it.
No. No. It's not worth it.
It's not worth it.
It's not worth it.
Come on, nigger!
Muriel.
Why don't you unlock the door
and let these people out of here?
What'd you say, lady?
Why don't you unlock the door
and let these people out of here?
Man. This one's a tiger, you know it?
Will you do what I ask you to do?
Will you please unlock the door
and let these people out of this car?
Why?
Muriel.
Well, what do you want to do with us?
Haven't you had your fun?
No, lady, I haven't had my fun.
M-Muriel.
Will you please unlock the door
and let these people out of this car?
Sit down, Muriel.
Why should I, lady?
Why should I unlock the doors
and let these people out?
Here.
What do you want to do with us?
I don't know.
What do you want me to do with you?
Why don't you just unlock the doors
and let the people out?
What's the matter?
That'll-That'll-That'll do now.
Over here. Come on. Unlock the
door and let these people out of this car.
Touché.
You're in trouble.
I'm in trouble?
Why, lady?
I know your name.
What's my name, lady?
Joe Ferrone,
and I'm gonna tell the police,
and they'll know where to find you,
so you're in trouble.
So you better unlock the door
and let us out.
Is that what you really wanna do, lady?
You really want me to just let
these people out of the car?
Is that what you really
want me to do, lady?
What?
What?
Is that what you wanna do, lady?
I want to get out of this car.
I can't stay in this car much longer,
so would you please
let us out of this car?
You're gonna slap my hand
if I don't let you out, lady?
Artie.
What's the matter, lady?
What are you-
Artie.
What's the matter? Don't you-
Don't you like me?
Don't do that.
Maybe you like him better.
Don't do that.
Lady?
Maybe you'd like the both of us, lady.
I look better without my glasses.
The both of us, lady?
Why do you let them talk to me like that?
Why do you let them talk to me like that?
You stood up here and you begged him.
What do you mean I'm begging them to
talk to me? You're begging them now!
Well, maybe, but what if I did?
They're men! You're nothing!
Hand you over to him and him?
I would rather have them than you!
You-You insignificant man!
You're nothing!
You're not a man!
I don't know why I'm your woman anymore!
Want to take on the whole subway?
You're no man!
You see that? Shot right in the mouth,
and he couldn't even see it coming.
Charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Don't make me run!
You got me!
Hello.
- Hey-
- Don't, Joe, don't!
Peekaboo.
Peekaboo.
- Leave us alone.
- Don't touch her!
What's the matter? I ain't hurtin' her.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
- Don't talk to her.
I just wanna look at her.
No!
Peekaboo, honey.
Don't touch her.
I just wanna talk to her!
Hi.
- Don't talk to her!
- Don't touch her!
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
I just wanna look at her.
I just wanna look at her.
I just wanna look at her, buddy.
Do you understand?
I just wanna talk to her.
I just wanna talk to her.
What you got here? Toys.
What you got in that, a doll?
Is that what you got?
Is that what you got?
What else you got?
You got another doll.
What you got here? All right, all
right, that's it! That's it!
Leave those people alone!
Do you hear me?
Hey, you!
You're crazy.
You leave those people alone
and be quiet! You hear me?
You just sit down and be quiet!
You just sit down and be quiet!
Or what?
Or I'll put you down.
Felix. Fel-Felix.
Hey, soldier boy.
I was wonderin' how long it would take.
Come on and put me down.
You boys call this a fair fight?
No. You?
It's all of you against the two of us.
I'll still take you on.
Come on, soldier boy!
Let's see what they taught you.
Let's go!
Come on!
No.
How-How-How bad is it, Felix?
Where were you, buddy?
Well, it-
it-it happened so fast, I-
I'll, I'll, I'll get - I'll get help.
I'll get help. I'll get help. Help!
Help! Get the police!
Get the police!
Somebody get the police!
Police! Get the police!
Somebody get the police!
How bad is it?
Get the police! Help!
Let me take a look at that.
I'll be all right.

Come on. Let me help you.
Let me help you up.
Come on.
Here. Put your arm around me.
Come on. Easy.
Easy.
Get me out of here.
