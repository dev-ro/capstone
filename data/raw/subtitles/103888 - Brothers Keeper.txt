Today, Delbert Ward is living
in the Madison County Jail.
Accused of killing
his brother and roommate.
State police report the body
of 64-year-old William Ward
was found in his bed
at 5:30 yesterday morning.
An autopsy showed
he had been suffocated.
Police believe 59-year-old
Delbert Ward
committed the crime.
Authorities don't yet know
a motive.
Everybody in Munnsville
knows the Ward boys.
Bill and Delbert used to ride
this green tractor
into town every day,
and their brothers,
Lyman and Roscoe,
they'd take the red one.
Good evening, everyone.
A man accused of killing
his brother out of mercy
is out of jail tonight.
As Christie Casciano

that means freedom.

the judge said that he would

And we went down,
I went down,
she sat in a seat up there
and I went down
where the lawyer was
explaining it to us,
'cause we're
a bunch of dummies, you know,
we didn't know,

And the lawyer said,
we gotta scrape up $10,000,

"you got your checkbook

I hate to call 'em "boys."
It's...
They're known that way
i-in the county, but...
and I'm-I'm pretty sure they
don't think it's a put down,
but it feels like one to me.
The morning that Bill died,
um, John had called me,
and I went right over
and I was there like ten
minutes after he'd called me.
And I said to Delbert,
"Would you like John and I,
what would you like
John and I to do?
Would you like us
to do the chores here
this morning for ya?
Help you out this morning
or something?"
And Delbert says,
"I would like you and John
to go get a dark suit
and a while shirt and a tie...
for Bill."

And he cried.
After they left that morning,
the police were certain
it was a natural death.
No question
in-in their mind.
[sniffling]
What happened later,
apparently,
is that the, uh...
they did an autopsy.
They did it
in about four hours,
which, at least,
I've been told,
is really not long enough
for a, a thorough autopsy.
And I judge the first thing
they found that was really
suspicious, they stopped,
so the police
came out here again,
and took all three brothers
down to the barracks
and questioned them,
and held Delbert,
who's confessed.

Oh, yeah.

Delbert killed him.
There was nothin' to it.
Not true?
No, not true.

morning hours of June sixth,

Uh, the call was from
Doctor Germaniuk,

Shoulda known it.
They're intelligent people,
but yet, they questioned them
all without an attorney,

don't know what the hell
"to waive his rights" means.
It's just some words to him.
I said,
"What did you waive Delbert?"
I ask him straight out.
I said, "when you did that?"
"I don't know."
That's his answer.
I asked him again last week,
I says,
"What did you waive
when you waived your rights?"
He still don't know.
He waived his rights,
but he don't know
what the hell he waived.
That might've been somebody
walkin' down the street

So, how can you charge
somebody like that?
How could you took the
statement to begin with
from him like that without
having a lawyer present?
The confession of Delbert,
uh, which was obtained here
at the barracks,
um, consisted upon, or
consisted of, uh,
Delbert telling
State Police investigators
that, uh...
uh, he had thought about,
um, killing William,
uh, because of, uh, the
suffering that he had, uh,
observed Wi-William
going through
over the last several months,
uh, and he focused in
on extreme headaches
and stomach problems, and he
had a problem with his foot
that the cow had stepped on,
and he based, basically,
his-his criminal conduct,
in killing William,
on the fact that, uh,
he felt William
was going through, uh,
an extreme amount of pain,
and that, uh,
he felt that, uh,
he would kill his brother for
these reasons.

We got our groceries.
He got his stuff he wanted

Done all his chores,
had supper,

about nine o'clock,

see him the next morning,
and I didn't.
How'd you feel about that?
Bad.
'Cause he's gone.

he'd have to have marks
on him wouldn't he?
And he didn't have
no marks on him.

a pillow over his face.
Well, they put that

Who put the pillow over him?
The police, I think.

'Cause the...
the first time I,
they show me his pictures,
he laid just the way I found
him, with nothing over him.
Then they took me down there

showed him with a...
pillow over, over his face.
Why would the police put
a pillow over Bill's face?
Well, 'cause they want
this right here.
Right here.
They want this land.
We know, for a fact, that
two of the State Troopers
who interviewed
a neighbor of Delbert's,
in addition
to asking about the case,
asked if the neighbor was
willing to sell his property.
Now, you've gotta remember
that we're talking about
an area in Madison County
that's right on
the, the edge of becoming
a very, very suburban type
of an area,
so that these farms
a-are worth a lot of money
to a developer.
If it's true...
it's one of the most
disgusting things
that I've seen as a,
as an attorney
in-in 13 or 14 years.
To think that somebody, uh,
for purely monetary gain,
would, uh, convince somebody
t-t-to write a confession,
or even worse,
put words into his mouth.
I cannot fathom
that there would be any
reason whatsoever for anybody
to want to have
acquired that land,
other than another farmer
to use it as farm land.
Uh, and to suggest that any
of the State Police officers
involved in the investigation
would even consider doing
something like that
is just ludicrous.

If anybody ever
grew up on a farm,
when a cow has a calf,
a lot of times, they get
paralyzed in their backsides,
and they have trouble
gettin' up,
and if you don't make 'em
get up,
they can't clean themselves
of afterbirth.
So, it's a very common
practice
amongst any and all farmers,
to hold the nostrils
and the mouth of a cow
that's down,
and once she gets
short of breath,
she'll just jump right up,
and she'll be
healthy as ever.
I still feel,
from the beginning,
that that's all
that Delbert was trying to do
was to treat his brother
like a cow
because that's all he knew.
He was just trying to make
him get up and go, I think.
I have no qualms in my mind,
he died in his sleep.
For these guys, time stopped...
back in the days

They were poor.

for two brothers who loved
each other like they did,
to...
for one to watch
the other in pain,
day after day after day, uh...

can present evidence
to the judge.
Friends here seem optimistic,
but they say it's frustrating
to know that,
despite all their efforts,

I really think
that most people
thought that they
minded their own business.
They were different.
As long as they

Well now, like, going in down
to the confections store,
or whatever to eat,
I kind of hate to eat after
they did, wouldn't you?
You wouldn't, you know...
- You know, wouldn't...
You wouldn't go right down

Same chair...
You'd move over a little bit,

Might get the best of ya.
You know they sweat...

They worked and, hell, I
don't think they changed
their clothes
in maybe six months,
unless they...
- No.
...went to a funeral
or something like that.
But they went,
uh...
the girls' weddings.
- Yeah.
And then they were
dressed up.
- Yeah.
[Interviewer]
And yet, you helped them.
That's right,

Yeah, they went to the, to
the girls' weddings,
Hell, they're a part
of this damn community.
- 'cause we did, too.
We've never had
a murder here,
as I ever remember.
There's always been
this antagonism
between the big city
a-and the rural areas.
You know, if, if you
are born in the rural area
and make it good,
it must mean
you go to the city
and make it good.
It's not,
you go down the road
and start your own business.
It's, you go to the city
and make it big.
And city people, I think,
are inclined to look at
country people as bumpkins.
As, uh...
probably not terribly bright,
and maybe, not awfully
strongly moti--motivated,
and nothing can be further
from the truth if you see,
see the way some of
these farmers work,
and I suspect
the city stereotype
is probably within the heads
of the BCI
and the District Attorney,
and they probably
don't know it,
it's just, it's part of
the culture that you think
rural area is that way,
you see,
and I-I think...
I think, maybe...
that...
part of the drawing together
of Munnsville behind Delbert
is that the
"We against Them,"

"Big City DA,"

The boys never got
any attention before.
When they had them dances
and stuff for him down here
and put on the benefits,
to Delbert, that was a party.
He didn't realize,
I don't think,
that we was trying to raise
money for his defense
so he wouldn't go to prison.
Nobody'd ever give
the Ward boys a party.
Not ever in their life.
So, here, all of a sudden,
is all these goddamn people
crowded around
and giving him a big party
and Delbert's dancing,
the first time in his life.
[cow mooing]
People coming up
and asking him to dance,
and hell, they wouldn't have
danced with him before,
for Christ's sakes,
if you had paid 'em to.
From what it appears,
uh, in the area,
the Wards were kind of
outcast people.
You know, they weren't
generally accepted
down there,
and it's one thing for...
the people who live there to
consider somebody an outcast,
but he was still
their outcast.
You know, if it
comes up to somebody else
looking into
the, the lifestyles
of people down there
and accusing them
of something, it's...
I find it's natural,
in some of these rural areas,
that people stick together.
They stick by their own,
the people in the area.
And that they went to,
went to back him
as being an underdog,
not caring really,
in my estimation,
whether he was right
or wrong, at that point.
He was just one of theirs.
Delbert told me...
that they were asking him all
kinds of questions,
and he was saying yes and no,
and he was getting tired,
and one of the troopers
said to him,
"Delbert, if you sign
this paper right here,
I'll take you home.
I see you're tired."
And Delbert said,
"I signed the papers,
and he slapped the handcuffs
right on me.
Took me to the lockup."

Did they tell you you could

No, they didn't tell me

When we were
in the Grand Jury,
a photograph was,
uh, given to Delbert,
and he was asked
to identify it.
It was a photograph of his,
of his brother
lying prone on the bed.
What was interesting
was that there was a pillow
that appeared to be
over the face.
Um, I don't know how or why
the photograph was offered.
I would hope...
for Mr. Cerio's sake,
that it wasn't offered
to represent the body

because, if it was,
that's not a true photograph.

As far as any fabrication of
evidence, uh, regarding, uh,

William Ward's case,

"outrageous," regarding that,

Lyman eventually
told us that, uh,
they had talked about
killing William
a couple days prior
to his death.
That conversation took place
out in front of
their residence.
In fact, Lyman said
it was under a big tree
in front of their house,
where, um, Delbert came up to
Lyman and says, um,
"You know, Brother William
is-is in a lot of pain
with his stomach and h-his
head problems.
He has continuous headaches,
and I think it's about time
that we did something, uh,
to help him,"
and then Lyman
asked Delbert, he says,
"What do you mean by,
you know,
'It's about time we
did something.'"
He says, "I think we, uh,
you know, should kill him
so he's not
suffering anymore,"
and initially,
they talked in regards
to how they were
going to kill him,
or how Delbert
was going to kill him,
and Delbert decided
he was gonna use a rifle
and shoot him in the head.
Um, Lyman had explained
to him that was too messy,
and he didn't wanna
do it that way,
or have it done that way,
and it was decided that
Delbert would choke him,

and kill him.

One of the problems
that I've...

[birds cawing]
They've jumped from,
uh, sex to, with incest,
or whatever you'd call it,
between the boys, to mercy
killing to,
what the hell, who knows.
They still haven't come up
with any motive
for why he would kill him.
Bill was the whole push
behind this family.
He was the boss.
He walked in front,
and Delbert walked
back of him,
and when Bill stopped,
Delbert would run into him.
That's the way they lead,
and that's the way
they followed.
They were two men that walked
the same pair of shoes,
so Delbert wouldn't, no way,
done anything to Bill.
According to my information,
and it must be...
on the record now,
they held Bill's body
two days
over at the funeral parlor
to do a rape test on him.
It come out inconclusive
or whatever the hell
they put it.
So, that was nothing.
[Interviewer]
What were they looking for?
Looking for sperm
in Bill's body.
That was because they
always slept together,
but if they'd found it
or not,
what the hell difference
does that make?
We got a lot of goddamn guys
down in New York City,
where you boys are from,
that sleep together.
[laughing]
And they ain't doin' it
just because it's
a way of life, either.
I mean, that would have
no bearing on the case,
whatsoever, in my mind.
We have lesbians and gay
people all over,
so why the hell
they was bothering
with Bill and Delbert?
I don't understand that part,
but they were just
fishing for something
to justify
what they were doin'.
That would be my
understanding of it.
Like a witch hunt.
Like the mercy killing.
He hasn't been sick, uh,
any more than normal.
For Bill, Bill was always
hobbling or lame
or a thumb-bunged
or his arm hurt or something,
and every time I had
ever seen him,
he's always had something
bunged up on him, so...
He wasn't sick...
so that would rule out
the mercy killing,
so what the hell else
could they come up with?
I think, probably, that...
you get a few
narrow-minded people,
it wouldn't matter
who slept together,
they'd have to
think the worst of 'em.
That's they way
our society works.
We're not back a hundred
years ago,
whatever you did
was all right.
Before we got heat
in the houses,
which the boys don't have no
central heating or anything,
they slept together,
probably, more or less,
for warmth,
so they wouldn't
freeze to death.
We used to have a wood stove,
and it heated one room.
You'd burn your belly
and freeze your ass.
When you get up to bed,
there was no heat
in all our bedrooms.
Oh, I think these boys
are the same way.
They just slept together
when they was kids,
and why the hell change it?
Was a comfortable arrangement
all the way around.
Just a habit.
These not are the most
educated people in the world.
It probably
never dawned on them
that anybody
would ever question
why they slept
in the same bed.
And before Bill died,
I don't think anybody
ever paid any attention.
You wouldn't think nothing
about it.
Hell, nobody ever went
in their house anyway.
Always talked
in the cow barn.
I've known them since,
for Christ's sakes,
for better than 50 years,
and I never been in their
house, only twice.
So, what the hell
did I care where they slept
or anybody else?
It's nobody's damn business.
So, when the investigators
pulled that one,
I was kind of surprised, but...
I guess they'd pull
most anything
when you get your tail
caught in a crack in a log.

It's about the Ward brothers,
Delbert, Roscoe,

All bachelors, who live

where they were born
in Munnsville.
It's a small dairy town
in central New York state.
The Ward Boys,
as they've always been known,
lived the way farmers did
200 years ago.
They never learned
to read or write.
They have no running water,
no modern farming equipment.
Nobody in town ever
paid much attention to them,
until one day last summer,
when Delbert was charged
with murdering his older
brother, Bill.
Suddenly,
the people of Munnsville

how simple they really are.
They never really grown up.
They're just

[Interviewer] You named your
gobblers after us?
Yup, that's right.
[laughing]
How come?
Well... good name!
- Yeah.
Good friends.
That's why I done it.
That's nice.
Well, we're honored.
I know that.
- Yeah.
[dogs barking]
How come you like
collecting birds?
Oh, well, I always did.
- How come?
I don't know.
I used to keep wild doves,
but I never had no luck
with 'em.
Well, what is it about birds
that you like?
Oh...
I like to see 'em around
and hear 'em- hear 'em-
hear 'em holler.
Always did.

Always like to hear them.
Gobble, gobble, gobble,

Can't fool that old bird.
[Cognetti] I wanted you here
today for several reasons.
The first, is to let you know
what's been happening.
I really haven't had an
opportunity to speak with-
with, uh... Hey, Roscoe.
Roscoe!
[speaking Italian]
[laughing]
I haven't had an opportunity
to speak with a lot of you,
since maybe even
the bail hearing,
which was many, many,
many months ago.
I am very disappointed
at what I see
from the District Attorney's
office.
At the time that the body
was moved to the...
uh, funeral home,
the clothes were taken
and Doctor Germaniuk,
sometime thereafter,
discovered that there was
some sperm
on the pant leg of William,
and some sperm on William
himself,
on his body.
That, at that moment,
changed his whole theory
of the murder.
It no longer is, at least,
this is what we've been able
t-t-to fathom,
it no longer is
a mercy killing.
Believe it or not,
it's a sex-gone-bad murder.
I think the allegation,
perhaps along with
some other things,
is that Delbert and William
were having sex,
uh, that a fight occurred,
and that Delbert
killed William.
That's-That's incredible.
That's what the new theory
may very well be.
He had continually said it
was Delbert's,
it was Delbert's,
it was Delbert's,
and we kept saying, how in
God's name do you know that?
Don't you think you should
check and see
if it's William's first?
Or is it the cow's?
Or is it somebody else's?
Now, I am so upset, and I
don't know what else to do.
If I could,
I told somebody over here,
if God were to tell me,
today, I'm gonna die,
the first person I-
this is great for them-
the first--
[laughing]
the first person I would kill
is Mr. Cerio.
I don't have any problem
with the guy
prosecuting the case
to the best of his ability.
They're going beyond that.
I think they look like
a bunch of fools
in Connie Chung's story.
I don't know where
a State Police Officer has
the guts--
[applause]
...to tell
on national television,
"I know he did it."
All of a sudden,
he's judge and jury?
Let me tell you
something else.
When this trial comes,
we're gonna have this planned
as if it was a Broadway show,
and I'm gonna ask
every one of you right now,
I want you to find
ten people,
and I want
that courtroom packed
every minute of every day,
and I want you people to look
those jurors in the eye
when they sit there.
That's what-
that's what I want,
and we'll take care
of the legal end.
I guarantee you,
you will be proud
of what's going to happen,
but I need your help.
I-I need your help,
a-and, uh...
I can't do it without you.
I want you people there.
Every day, from the moment
we begin,
to the moment we end.
You can bring your lunches.
I-It's gotta be that way.
I want- I want the people
in Madison county to know
that this stuff can't happen.
The problem is,
because it could be you
next time
or you next time
or you next time.
[dogs barking in distance]

Well, Delbert,
this is the day
we've been waitin' for,
maybe we'll get it over.
Maybe.
I hope so.

Madison County Court
is now in session.
Honorable William F. O'Brien
the Third presiding.
Yeah.
Good morning and thank you.
Have a seat, please.
[cough]
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.
This is a murder case,
wherein, the defendant,
that man...
...is charged by indictment,
with having intentionally
caused the death of another...
...in this case, his brother,
William J. Ward,
by placing his had or hands
over the nose and mouth
of his brother...
...thereby intentionally
causing his death
by asphyxiation.
You will hear
that the defendant,
at that time,
stated to Police Officers,
"After Bill went to sleep,
I decided to put my hand
over his mouth."
He said that he held his hand
there for about five minutes,
until he felt that William
was dead,
and at the conclusion
of this case,
ladies and gentlemen...
...upon the conclusion
of your deliberations...
...I will ask you to return...
...a verdict of guilty
in this case.
Guilty of the crime of murder
in the second degree.
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me begin
by saying simply...
...perhaps dramatically, that...
Delbert Ward did not...
...murder his brother William.
Delbert Ward could no sooner
kill his brother, Bill,
than he could kill
a half-dead tom cat.
I would submit,
ladies and gentlemen,
you will unquestionably learn
that what we have is a child
in the body of a man.
Here is a man,
whose disability,
whose simple personality,
made him susceptible
to tactics,
that would have been
recognized by you and I,
as coercive, when used
against Delbert Ward.
Here's a man, who allegedly...
...signed an alleged
confession...
...and that confession, ladies
and gentlemen,
that confession
is the only proof
that the prosecutor
will show you,
will give to you
over the next several days,
that can connect Delbert
with the murder
of his brother, Bill.
There was and is
no independent...
...medical proof...
...that William died
as a result of a homicide.
You must come back,
ladies and gentlemen,
and tell Delbert and I
that you find him
not guilty...
...of the crime of murder
in the second degree.
As I remember,
m-m-my feeling was that he
was telling it like he is,
he didn't know
what was wrong,
and, uh, that's what he said,
he said, "Something's wrong
with Bill."
Oh, all over the world
everybody knows Delbert,
in our hometown.
[clears throat]
If you saw him again,
could you pick him out?
Yeah.
Could you recognize him?
- Yeah.
Is he in the courtroom?
- Yeah.
Well, would you- can you
point him out for us, please?
Okay.
The gentleman
with the gray beard?
What was that?
The gentleman
with the gray beard?
[laughing]
What?
I-Is it the man
with the gray beard
you're pointing to?
Yes.
The record may reflect
that he has identified
the defendant.
[rooster crows]
Come on.

Come on.

[dogs barking]
[Judge] You may proceed,
Mr. Cerio.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Would you state
your full name, please?
My full name is Humphrey Don
Germaniuk.
H-U-M-P-H-R-E-Y-
D-O-N-G-E-R-M-A-N-I-U-K.
And could you tell us
what a Medical Examiner is?
A Medical Examiner
is a licensed doctor
whose function it is to
determine a cause of death,
a manner of death,
and to investigate death.
A cause of death
is any event that,
ultimately,
is responsible
for the individual's demise.
The manner of death
are the circumstances
in which the cause of death
took place.
Let's take an example
of an unnatural death,
where there's an individual
lying on the floor
of his or her home.
The individual is lying in a
pool of blood.
There's a revolver
next to the individual.
There's a hole
in the individual's head.
The cause of death,
more likely than not,
would be gunshot wound
to the head.
But what is the manner?
What are the circumstances
surrounding that?
Did someone shoot him or her?
Did they take their own life?
Or was it an accident?
So, even though we may have
the same cause of death,
the manner may vary.
Suppose this individual
was a businessman,
whose business was failing.
He was in financial troubles.
Recent divorce,
perhaps depressed.
There's no evidence of
breaking into the house,
no evidence of rummaging,
no money taken.
Then, more likely than not,
we begin to think
that this could be a suicide.
Let's take the same body,
same pool of blood, same gun,
same floor, same building.
The cause of death is still
gunshot wound to the head,
but if we find out that the
house has been broken into,
money has been taken,
the drawers have been
rummaged and disheveled,
then we begin to suspect
that perhaps
this could be a homicide.
[heavy breathing]
Mr. Cerio will ask you
some questions, Mr. Ward.
Mr. Ward,
c-can you hear me okay?
Can you- can you tell us,
sir, your full name?
Lyman George Ward.
How old are you, sir?
How old are you?
Sixty-six.
Sixty-six?
Do you remember
when William died?
I remember when he died.
Where were you?
When he died?
- Yes.
I must have been in bed.
- Must have been in bed.
- Huh?
Must have been in bed.
[unintelligible mumbling]
Oh.
You've answered the question,
Mr. Ward.
I-I believe his answer was,
"Must have been in bed."
Is that your answer?
- Mm-hmm.
Mr. Ward,
before your brother died...
...was there ever any
conversation...
...about...
....ending Bill's life?
No.
You never had that
conversation with anyone?
No.
Now, this is entitled,
The Supporting Deposition...

[Cognetti] Can you identify
that for us, Doctor?
Yes, we have one, two, three,
four, five containers
holding various specimens
from Medical Examiner
case number 900391.
And who would that be?
That would be William Ward.
Can you identify that for us?
People's exhibit 21
identifies the head
and regions of the neck
of case number 90 dash 0391.
How is it that you can
identify this?
The identifying numbers
are right here
on the front part
of the neck.
Doctor, after having
photographed there,
what did you do?
I then continued examining
the eyes.
I looked at the upper eyelids
and lower eyelids,
and in the lower eyelids,
I noticed what
are called petechiae.
I also examined
the dental arches.
Uh, the individual, uh,
had no teeth,
and what I noticed was,
on the upper dental arch,
on the right side, there was
also these diffuse petechiae,
or pinpoint blood spots.
All throughout the windpipe,
beginning with the little
blade on top,
called the epiglottis,
down to the windpipe,
where it breaks in half
to feed the right lung
and the left lung,
had multiple, uh,
numerous of these red
pinpoint bloody spots.
With that diffuse spray
of petechiae,
the large numbers of
petechiae that were there
and their distribution,
I first began to think
that we may be dealing with
an asphyxial type of death.
In my opinion,
based upon a reasonable
degree of medical certainty,
this is not a case
of asphyxiation.
There are, uh, four
significant, uh, findings
that I would look for
in a case of asphyxiation,
that are not present
in this case.
No cyanosis,
no increased liquidity
of blood,
no injuries
around the nose, mouth,
gums, chin, tongue,
and, um,
the absence of...
even the slightest suggestion
of regurgitation.
When you are
being asphyxiated,
you are struggling
and gasping for air,
food is gonna come back up
on you,
you're gonna start retching.
There is none of that,
whatsoever.
Zero.
[metal clattering]
[clearing throat]

[pig squealing]
Roll over, goddamn you.
Delbert, you wanna grab me
that meat cleaver
and knife sharpener
out the front passenger seat?
You have to get in my door,
that one's locked.
[motor whirring]
Thanks, Moses.
[Cognetti] Doctor, it's true,
is it not,
that at the conclusion
of your internal
and external examination,
you could not say,
with a required degree
of medical certainty,
the cause or the manner
of death?
That is correct.
By that, I mean to say,
you couldn't, certainly with
any degree of-of certainty,
indicate that it was
a homicide.
That is correct.
But now, you're talking
with Mr. Cerio,
and your notes indicate
that you tell him that I
cannot rule out homicide.
Am I right?
- That is correct.
Once you got to the scene,
Doctor, uh,
were not you advised,
immediately,
to call the State Police
barracks in Oneida?
We were.
And, at the conclusion
of this call,
did he not tell you
that Delbert had confessed
to the killing
of his brother?
Yes.
So that death certificate,
Doctor,
came about as a result
of your learning
that Mr. Ward had confessed
to the crime of murder
in the second degree?
No.
Doctor, if you
had never learned
that Mr. Ward...
had confessed
to the crime of murder
in the second degree,
would you...
...on June 7th, have changed
that death certificate?
No.
So, let me go back then,
Doctor.
That death certificate
was changed
because you now learned
that Mr. Ward had confessed
to the crime of murder
in the second degree?
But that was not the only
piece of information.
We know about the petechiae.
Correct?
- Correct.
But we know, Doctor,
as we talked about
innumerable times yesterday,
that at that stage,
there were a host of reasons
for petechiae.
That is correct.
So, we'll put that aside.
Because, as you
just indicated,
that would not
have been enough...
...to warrant a change
in that death certificate
on June 7th.
That's correct.
So again, let me ask you.
That death certificate
was changed, on June 7th,
for the sole reason
that Mr. Ward had confessed
to the crime.
Isn't that the reason,
on June 7th,
that that death certificate
was changed?
No.
[Dr. Wecht] In my opinion,
the cause of death
of Mr. William Ward
was right heart failure,
resulting in pulmonary edema,
the, uh, collection of a
substantial amount of fluid
in the lungs.
[Delbert]
I tried to tell him
I didn't do it...
...and Geen Rifenberg
and "Kellogg" said I did.
[Cerio]
Okay.
They kept right after me
and said if I cooperated
with the police,
they'd go much easier on me.
Mm-hmm.
So, finally, I thought
if I cooperated with 'em,
I'd get out of there
and get home.
Okay.
But I didn't.
- You didn't?
No.
You were gonna cooperate
with them?
Yes, and Mr. Rifenburg
is the one who showed me
how I put my hand over
William's mouth and nose.
Uh-huh.
And that happened
in that room?
That happened in that room.
It's not that you showed him
how it happened?
No, I didn't how him.
He showed me.
Mr. Ward, what other kind
of shows do you watch
besides Westerns?
Oh, some of the police stories.
Police stories?
- Mm-hmm.
What kind of police
story shows?
Like "Matlock" there
and "Heat of the Night."
That's about the only two.
Okay, ever watch "Hunter?"
No.
- Never saw "Hunter?"

and the way things have been
going against us all the way
so far, there's a real good
possibility of it.

You explained it to me.

barracks that night?
I would submit, that they
felt they were bringing
a bunch of queer
old farmers,
who lived like animals, who
were stupid...
...and ignorant, without
a friend in the world.
Do you really wanna believe
that the New York State Police,
the Medical Examiners
of Onondaga County,
decided to pick
on Delbert Ward
for no other reason than,
"Let's come up
with a homicide.
Let's come up with a murder,
and let's pick out
that man to do it."
We know him to be educably,
mentally retarded with
a schizoid personality.
William was 64 years of age,
ladies and gentlemen.
He died a natural death in
his sleep from heart failure,
the most common form of
death of a man that age.
You, ladies and gentlemen,
saw the defendant testify.
You make the assessment
as to whether or not...
...he's an
intelligent fellow.
Yeah, are there some
social deprivations?
Yes.
I don't think you
can dispute that.
Does this person
appear to simply be
a person with an IQ of 63 and
educably, mentally retarded?
Or does it appear
to be higher?
There is no independent
medical proof which,
standing alone without
that confession,
says that William died
as a result of a murder.
The only thing that has been
given to you people
is this alleged confession.
Taken from a man
whose very appearance cries
out for special treatment.
As expected, both sides gave
strong closing arguments,
and after three weeks
of emotional testimony,

Time for an update, now, on
tonight's top stories.
[Female Reporter]
First, go live
to Christie Casciano
at the Delbert Ward
trial in Wampsville.
Christie, what's happened
over the last hour?
Well, since we last talked,
the jury left, as we said,
for a dinner break, and the
verdict has not been quick
in coming, as some courtroom
observers have predicted.
The jury has the task
of deciding whether Delbert
Ward committed murder.
Whether he
suffocated his brother
on their Stockbridge
farm last June.
The jury got the case
at 11:30 this morning.
Since that time, they've been
weighing evidence,
sifting through testimony,
and they've been at
it for about six hours.
They left the
courtroom, as we said,
about a half hour ago,
six o'clock.
They're on a dinner break.
They're expected back
here at eight o'clock,
and we will
be back here, too,
and bringing you
the latest at 11.
Right now, let's
go to Lisa Sweitzer
for more of today's
top stories.
[Judge] Uh, ladies and
gentlemen, the, uh,
jury has advised the court
that they have
reached a verdict,
and I now admonish all of
those here in the courtroom,
including spectators, that
you are to remain seated
throughout the entire
reporting of the
verdict procedure.
In the event that there
should be any violations
of that, I will
close the courtroom,
you will be escorted
from the courtroom,
and you can find about,
find out the verdict
by either reading about
it in the newspaper
or seeing it on television.
There are to be
no audible reactions
or emotional outbursts by
anyone in this room,
and I mean that, and if
there are any outbursts,
I'm gonna empty
the whole courtroom.
The jurors may return
to the courtroom.
[coughing]
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, I understand, uh, from
the court clerk, that the,
uh, jury has, in fact,
reached a verdict,
and, uh,
- Mr. Broderick, is that so?
- Yes, sir.
All right.
The court attendant will
receive the card.
Mr, uh, Broderick, the, uh,
court has, uh, received the
verdict sheet, and I now ask
you, as the foreman of this
jury, have you, in fact,
reached a verdict
in this case?
Yes, they have.
What is the verdict
of this jury
in connection with the crime
of murder in the
second degree?
Have you found the defendant
guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.
[crowd murmuring]
Ladies and gentlemen
of this jury, the, uh,
court had heard Mr. Broderick
announce that the verdict
is that of not guilty of
murder in the second degree.
I now ask all of you, uh,
is this your verdict,
so say you all?
[Jury]
Yes.
Mr. Ward, you are excused
now, and you can leave.
We'll ask the, uh,
media to step aside
so that you can leave.
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen
for your respect
and attention.
[applause]
God bless you.
[Male Reporter 1]
So, that smile says it all?
- Yup.
- Yup.
Thank all my friends.
[Female Reporter]
What's next for you, Delbert,
back to the farm?
Back to the farm.
[Male Reporter 2]
How does it feel, Mr. Ward?
[Thurston]
You got it, buddy.
[Interviewer]
Harry, how do you feel?
My heart ain't
gone back down yet.
[laughing]
But I'll get it
down by morning.
Did you think it was
gonna turn out this way?
The system works, don't it?
What do you think, Delbert?
I thought it might,
but I wasn't sure.
I'll get home
as soon as I can.
I love you, babe.
Goodbye.
Thanks.
Bye.
[Interviewer]
How do you feel?
Damn.
Sh--.
How do I feel?
I'm very, very happy.
What's all this
noise out here?
Looks like a wedding.
Are you kidding me,
they won't get to sleep
tonight and, uh...
Not in Munnsville.
Not in Munnsville.
You goin' to Disneyland now?
[sigh]
[laughing]
I listened to all
of the evidence,
and I could find no
solid evidence to prove
that even a crime
had been committed.
[woman]
Justice was done.
It was.
[woman]
Amen.
Amen.
Oh Delbert, we're happy.
- We're happy for you!
- Thank you all.
- We're happy for you.
- We're all happy for you!

was full this morning.

and I didn't, they wouldn't
even let me buy it.

works at the diner up there,
took the money out
of their own pocket,
and paid for all of it.

Sure.
