We must break free
from the petty politics of the past.
America is a nation of believers
that is being led by a group of censors,
critics and cynics.
All of the people telling you,
"You can't have the country you want,"
are the same people that wouldn't stand...
I mean, they said, "Trump doesn't have
a chance of being here tonight."
Oh, we love defeating those people,
don't we?
Don't we love defeating them?
To all Americans tonight,
I make this promise.
We will make America safe again.
We will make America strong again.
And we will make America great again!
God bless you and good night!
I love you.
My name is Roger Stone,
and I'm an agent provocateur.
Stone's Rules are things
that I have learned in life
that I seek to pass on to others
who may want to be
in the same business that I'm in.
Or, actually, any business,
'cause they are fully applicable.
So, for example, a Stone's Rule:
"It is better to be infamous
than never be famous at all."
Stone's Rule.
One man's dirty trick
is another man's political, civic action.
Everything I do,
everything I've done, has been legal.
But politics ain't beanbag
and losers don't legislate.
The truth will be suppressed no longer.
Lock her up!
Lock her up!
Well, Roger has a really rough reputation.
They talk about "dirty trickster"
and lots of other things,
but I've known him for a long time,
and he's actually a quality guy.
He's a nice guy.
Just a few descriptions of you here:
"A state-of-the-art sleazeball,"
"a little rat,"
"an actor who likes to assume poses."
I believe in winning.
I believe in doing whatever is necessary
to win, short of breaking the law.
In the world of political consulting,
there are a number of rogues.
But there's...
There's really nobody
quite like Roger Stone.
Roger is the sinister Forrest Gump
of American politics.
He's not just this simpleminded guy,
but this Machiavellian, almost crazy guy
who shows up at every key moment
in recent American history.
Roger has a great understanding
of the media.
He understands politics
and he understands politicians.
And he always likes to take on somebody
that at least has a good chance
of winning,
and sometimes it doesn't work out.
He's had some people that I said,
"What are you doing with these people?"
But, you know...
But he loves it and he loves the game.
He has fun with it,
and he's very good at it.
In many respects,
Roger Stone created Donald Trump
as a political figure.
There is no doubt that in tone,
in affect, in profile,
the Trump candidacy was
a pure Roger Stone production.
When Mexico sends its people...
They're bringing drugs,
they're bringing crime, they're rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.
Whereas the rest
of us looked at Trump
and saw someone
who was impossibly vulgar and impolite,
Roger looked at him and said, "You know,
this is someone who voters might like."
I mean, Roger actually gets
democracy in a way,
I think most people
who cover politics don't.
You know, democracy is the process
of appealing to the majority.
My name's Donald Trump,
and I'm the largest real estate developer
in New York.
I own buildings all over the place,
model agencies, the Miss Universe pageant.
But it wasn't always so easy.
About 13 years ago,
I was billions of dollars in debt.
But I fought back and I won, big league.
Now my company is bigger than it ever was
and I'm having more fun than I ever had.
Hello, everybody.
Fifteen seasons of The Apprentice
not only makes him
a smooth television performer,
but think of the way he looked.
High-backed chair, perfectly lit,
great makeup, great hair, decisive,
making decisions, running the show.
He looks presidential.
Do you think voters, non-sophisticates,
make a difference
between entertainment and politics?
Politics is show business for ugly people.
Roger always wanted me
to run for president.
And over the years,
every time a presidential race came up,
he always wanted me to run.
And I just didn't have interest
at that time.
And nor was the country
in trouble like it is today.
The American Dream is dead.
Bring it back!
But if I get elected president,
I will bring it back.
Bigger and better
and stronger than ever before.

I have never been more excited
about a presidential campaign.
I have never seen a grassroots uprising.
This is not the Republicans
versus the Democrats.
That's right.
This is the elites of the Republican
and Democratic Party
who have driven this country
into the ditch
versus Donald J. Trump
and the rest of America.
I thank you for your support.
We are on the verge of making America
great again. Thank you.
How are you doing? Good.
- Take a picture with my son?
- Yes. How are ya?
And if you decide to run for president
in, like, 2039, look me up.
I will.
I understand how fame works.
You know, the four stages of fame.
It's like, "Who is Roger Stone?"
"Get me Roger Stone."
"Get me a Roger Stone type."
"Who is Roger Stone?"
A mock election was planned
in my elementary school.
And I was for John F. Kennedy
because my parents were Catholic,
and I thought,
although they were Republicans,
they had a certain sympathy for Kennedy.
But also because Kennedy's hair was
so much better than Nixon's hair.
And, therefore, I went to the cafeteria
and as each kid would go through
the cafeteria line with their tray,
I would tell them, "You know,
Nixon has proposed"
having school on Saturdays."
Well, then the mock election was held,
and to the surprise
of the local newspaper,
Democrat John Kennedy swept
this mock election.
For the first time ever,
I understood the value of disinformation.
Of course,
I've never practiced it since then.
We Republicans seek
a government that attends
to its inherent responsibilities,
encouraging a free
and a competitive economy,
and enforcing law and order.
My first
Republican National Convention was 1964.
I was 12 years old.
The woman who lived next door to me,
she gave me a copy of a book,
The Conscience of a Conservative
by Barry Goldwater.
And I devoured this book
in, you know, a day.
It was at that moment that I knew
what I wanted to do.
I no longer wanted to be an actor.
I now wanted to be in politics.
Little did I know how similar they are.
I became a zealot.
I had a Goldwater sticker on my bicycle.
I wore Goldwater buttons.
I wore a Goldwater button
two weeks after the election was over.
That's how defiant I was.
I met Roger in college.
He was really a total prodigy,
in terms of his political ability.
He was talking grown men back home
into running for office, electing them.
And then we would sit in our dorm room
and they would call Roger
for political advice
as to how they should vote on key issues.
His mother once said,
"You're not a Catholic.
Your religion is the Republican Party
and your god is Richard Nixon."
Bart Porter asked him, you know,
if he'd be interested
in coming to the Nixon campaign,
so Roger took time off of school
to go join the campaign.
This is central headquarters
for the Re-Elect Nixon Campaign.
The White House.
But for the sake of appearances,
the Re-Elect Nixon headquarters, in name,
is one block up Pennsylvania Avenue.
The Committee
to Re-Elect the President
was unlike any campaign that I'd been in.
It didn't look like
your typical political headquarters.
It had a very hushed,
corporate quality to it.
Porter called me into his office and said,
"We want you to go to New Hampshire,"
and we want you to give this contribution
to Pete McCloskey,
who's running
for the Republican nomination,
challenging Nixon from the left,
"in the name
of the Young Socialist Alliance."
I got an enormous mason jar,
filled it with pennies and nickels
and dimes and quarters.
I brought it
to the McCloskey headquarters.
I said, "Hi, I'm from
the Young Socialist Alliance."
I wanna donate this,
and I need a receipt."
They were so dumb, they gave me one.
The idea was to give the receipt
to the Manchester Union Leader,
the largest newspaper in New Hampshire,
as a way of discrediting McCloskey.
A perfect example of a dirty trick
that had no purpose and no effect,
but the Nixon people thought it was great.
I never heard another word about it...
until an investigator from the Senate
Watergate Committee knocked on my door.
We have a mystery story
out of Washington.
Five people have been arrested and charged
with breaking into the headquarters
of the Democratic National Committee
in the middle of the night.
The Democratic
National Committee is located
in the Watergate office building.
I welcome this kind of examination,
because people have got to know
whether or not their president is a crook.
Well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.
I was the youngest person
to go to the Watergate grand jury.
During the Senate
Watergate Committee hearings,
this enormous chart was put up,
in which everyone who received money
from this secret fund was put on the wall.
And it said, "Gordon Liddy,
McCord, Segretti."
And then way down at the bottom,
it said "Stone."
I paid $100 to Mr. Roger Stone
on one occasion.
My parents called me on the phone.
They were mortified.
I thought it was pretty cool.
To leave office
before my term is completed
is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
But as president,
I must put the interests of America first.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.
I was a Watergate figure
at 19 years old.
I mean, at the time,
I was scared shitless.
It was very hard to find work.
We used to have these buttons that said
"hire a Watergate vet."
So this is the Batcave.
This is "the Factory," as we call it.
This is where I tape
my Saturday radio shows.
It is also the repository
of probably the world's largest collection
of Nixon memorabilia.
The 1962 campaign for governor.
Uh, a rally that I actually attended.
A head shot poster of the day.
This is protesting
Nixon's historic trip to China.
Here you have the first
and second generation Nixon bongs.
This is among my most prized possessions.
Roger Stone does
occasional political chores for Nixon.
One such chore, to organize dinners
of journalists at Nixon's New Jersey home.
I was the assigned liaison
between the Reagan campaign
and former President Nixon,
transmitting memos back and forth.
It was not until his post-presidency
that we became close friends.
He had been through a lot, obviously,
but I think he was
just as resilient as ever.
His greatest single quality is resilience.
And that's the purpose of my tattoo.
It's not an ideological statement.
It's a reminder that in life,
when you get knocked down,
you have to get up off the canvas
and keep pushing, get back in the game.
That's the story of Nixon.
A man is not finished when he is defeated.
He's only finished when he quits.
The Nixon tattoo is really
all you need to know about Roger.
Because he thinks
Nixon's approach to politics,
the toughness,
the win-at-all-costs mentality,
that's what Roger reflects.
Delegates to the Young Republicans
Convention in Memphis
have chosen as their chairman
a conservative with a Watergate past.
Watergate dominated
this convention
because the Republican Party's
important youth arm
was about to be taken over by Roger Stone,
a 25-year-old political operative
who was deeply involved
in the 1972 Nixon "dirty tricks" campaign.
They embellished
what was a 20-year-old kid's role
into being the mastermind of Watergate.
Roger saw the opportunity
to build a reputation
off of being viewed
as that politically significant.
Opponents of Stone contend
that his election is part of a move
by conservative activists
to take over the Republican Party.
When we elected Roger,
we moved the Republican Party
in a more ideological direction.
Up until that point, it was straddling
the old Republican establishment
and the new conservative movement
that was started in Barry Goldwater days.
We built on that,
and I think when Roger was elected
chairman of the Young Republicans,
you know, that was the piece
that finalized everything.
For many years, the Republican Party
was associated with this sort of good guy,
Eisenhower earnestness.
What happened with the new right
was there was a new generation
of people who said,
"You know what? We're gonna fight dirty
and we're gonna win."
Among the revolutionary changes
in American politics the past few years
has been the rise
of the political action committees,
called PACs,
fund-raising groups for special interests.
NCPAC,
the National Conservative Political
Action Committee based in Virginia,
rich in money, and dedicated
to doing in the nation's liberals.
Even, its director Terry Dolan says,
if that means using the politics of fear.
I don't think there's anything wrong
with fear.
I met Terry Dolan
when we were teenage Republicans
together in Connecticut.
When we got married,
Terry was our best man.
But more than that,
he actually ended up moving in with us.
We used to refer to him as "the child."
It was on our living room floor
that NCPAC was born.
NCPAC, the National Conservative
Political Action Committee,
is transformative in the sense
that we really pioneered
negative campaign advertising
in massive doses to win elections.
Up to that time,
it really hadn't been done.
I came to Washington
for the Wall Street Journal
in, um, the very end of 1983.
And Roger was already
kind of a legend by then,
kind of a dark legend,
Because of the negative ads
that he and NCPAC had run.
So people thought of him
as kind of a wizard behind the scenes.
I remember meeting him
on the street and thinking,
"Wow, that's Roger Stone."
Birch Bayh telling us
he's fighting inflation.
The price tag on that baloney
is $46 billion.
Because if Bayh wins, you lose.
The story of NCPAC is
that after Watergate,
there were campaign finance reforms
to try to control the corruption
in spending on politics.
So what the Republicans did was,
they figured out a way
around the new rules.
The focus of NCPAC was
to use all the tools of a campaign,
but instead of having a candidate,
to use it through a PAC.
We could only give
a Senate campaign,
in a direct financial transfer of $5,000.
But the loophole was we could advertise
on behalf of a candidate,
without their cooperation or coordination,
an unlimited amount.
And that's why NCPAC was successful.
It was a political disaster
for Senate Democrats.
They not only lost control of the Senate,
they lost some of the biggest names
in the Democratic Party
and many of their most prominent liberals.
Regrettably, NCPAC consistently plays
to the dark side of human nature.
Its stock-in-trade is the half-truth,
the innuendo, the distortion.
Power is what PACs are about.
The power to raise and give money
to political candidates,
who, in turn,
will at least give them a hearing
and at best do their bidding.
Roger was one of the inventors
of the modern political system.
The PACs, the super PACs.
That is where Roger has made
his influence,
and it continues to be felt.
I'm convinced that at some point,
with these types of programs,
you could elect Mickey Mouse
to the House or the Senate.
Ronald Reagan for president.
He'll make America great again.
The district we're in
is Congressman Gary Lee.
After this, we go to the 32nd District,
where those guys
just got knocked off the ballot.
You're good at this.
You must have had some experience.
1980,
Ronald Reagan defeats Jimmy Carter.
I was running
three northeastern states for Reagan,
as a regional political director.
I think most observers didn't recognize.
Reagan's enormous appeal
to blue-collar Catholics
and working-class people.
And, of course, he carried
all three states and the presidency.
And I'm proud of the fact that I played
some tiny, infinitesimal role
in saving the United States
by electing Ronald Reagan.
The Reagan voter is a blue-collar,
working-class, middle education,
middle-income-level voter.
Roger identified the Reagan Democrat.
He actually wrote up the strategy
for reaching out specifically
to the blue-collar and the Catholic vote.
He tends to be a second, third-generation
Catholic... Italian, Irish, Polish.
The Reagan Democrat was
a critical part
of bringing over states
that normally would not vote Republican.
Let us pledge to each other,
with this great lady looking on,
that we can, and so help us God,
we will, make America great again.
Thank you very much.
Roger is unique, in my experience,
because he actually embraces infamy.
He doesn't worry
that you think he's a sleazeball.
He wants you to think he's a sleazeball.
What a cheap, low-class way to operate.
Why do you embrace
the role of dirty trickster?
Well, I'm stuck with it now.
It's gonna be in the first paragraph
of my New York Times obit,
so I might as well go with the flow.
The only thing I can think of worse
than being talked about...
is not being talked about.

"For Roger, with fond memories
and the highest regard and affection
for his good work in the 1980 campaign.
From a good friend, Roy Cohn."
This is a man
that everybody is going to enjoy meeting.
He's Roy M. Cohn,
who was confidential assistant
to the United States Attorney General.
In 1953, Roy Cohn became
chief counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy's
communist-hunting
investigations committee.
His reign
of televised intimidation in the 1950s
has become synonymous with demagoguery,
fearmongering and character assassination.
Cohn went on
to private practice and made millions.
He became one of the most politically
connected lawyers in the nation.
The last two decades
of his career were marred
by allegations of fraud,
blackmail and perjury.
When I was assigned New York
for Ronald Reagan in 1979,
for the 1980 election,
shortly thereafter I was invited
to a dinner party
being thrown by a Washington socialite...
who, in all honesty,
I was trying to lay...
and Cohn was present.
So I made my way up to him.
I introduced myself. I said,
"Mr. Cohn, I'm... I'm Roger Stone."
He looked at me and said,
"Are you the son or the grandson
of the Roger Stone
who's running the Reagan campaign
here in New York?"
I said, "No, that's me."
He turns to his partner Tom Bolan.
He says, "Reagan's in trouble."
I wrote a lot about Roy Cohn.
I started hearing about Roger
from people who were close to Roy.
Roy Cohn is the single most evil person
I have ever covered.
If that's a magnet for you as a young man,
it says you're soulless before you start.
Well, my attitude regarding
those who criticize me
for being friends with Roy Cohn
or Richard Nixon is... fuck 'em.
Roger's relationship
with Cohn was, in part, mentor.
Cohn had a slice of history,
and a circle of friends that would not
have necessarily been part of our orbit.
It's how we met Trump.
Donald Trump is probably one of the most
important names in America today.
He is, as I say, the closest thing
to a genius I've ever met in my life.
On "Special Segment" tonight,
Mike Jensen profiles a man
who, at the age of 39,
is not content with being New York City's
latest real estate billionaire.
Donald Trump has also ventured
into gambling and professional football
and says he could negotiate a nuclear
disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union.
Donald Trump,
a tough man in a tough city.
Steve, you're gonna have to start pushing
these people now,
'cause it's getting a little ridiculous,
as far as I'm concerned.
At the age of 39,
Donald Trump has become
one of America's best known
and most successful builders.
And, not surprisingly,
he has an ego almost as big as his empire.
I had a lawyer,
who was a very good lawyer, tough lawyer,
named Roy Cohn.
He introduced me, at one point,
to Roger Stone.
Roy thought Roger was a very tough guy.
Roy knew some very tough guys,
I will tell you that,
but Roy always felt
that Roger was not only tough,
but a smart guy and very political.
Trump is an expert
at getting what he wants,
particularly from politicians.
He's gotten tax abatements
and other concessions.
Politicians have gotten
campaign contributions.
Big ones.
Roger's the first one
who introduced us to Donald,
and Donald was one of our clients
at Black, Manafort, Stone
in the early '80s
and was a client of ours for a long time.
In the early days
of the Reagan administration,
Roger was so prominent and so successful,
he could have become
a sort of great man of the party.
He was a real insider.
He was a political consultant,
a lobbyist,
someone who was right
in the thick of things.
Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and I
had worked together
through the Reagan campaign.
When the Reagan campaign got
short of cash,
and decided to start
a political consulting firm.
Paul Manafort came in one day and said,
"You know,
we ought to start a lobbying firm,"
because I'm getting a lot of calls from
people who know we all work for Reagan
and know the people who are gonna be
in the Reagan administration,
"and they want lobbying."
So we did.
- Good to see you.
- This is Paul Manafort.
What we were doing was
trying to use our relationships
that we had built up,
first through the Young Republicans
and then through NCPAC,
and to create a business
that would focus on political consulting.
Lobbying had been considered
kind of a sleazy business,
but Roger Stone unabashedly came out
and said,
"I'm gonna make a pile of money off this
and no apologies."
Black, Manafort & Stone was the shit.
It was the biggest, most powerful
lobbying operation in Washington.
We did things
that nobody else had ever done.

There were a lot of gray people
in gray suits and tan raincoats
in Washington.
They were all sort of interchangeable.
And then you had Roger Stone.
And when he went to fancy parties,
he wore black patent leather slippers.
He was a whole new level of, sort of,
splash and show business
and money and glitz.
♪ Money for nothin' ♪
Joining us now, Roger Stone,
who belongs to one of Washington's
most successful consulting firms.
The argument, I gather, seems to be
that you helped elect 'em,
and now you're helping to tell them
what to do,
and this really isn't what
the Founding Fathers had in mind.
First of all, the term "influence shops"
is really not accurate at all.
I think that what we provide
for our clients,
be them foreign countries
or corporations or individuals,
is a superior understanding
of how Washington works.
Before Black, Manafort & Stone,
it was considered somewhat distasteful
for campaign types
to immediately go into lobbying,
trying to influence the people
they just elected.
What Black, Manafort & Stone said was,
"We're unapologetic."
We got this guy elected,
and now we're going to make money
"by charging for access
to his administration."
There's been a massive expansion
of the lobbying sector in Washington.
Some of them are so powerful
and successful
that we don't question it.
We just assume it's a fact
of American political life.
Black, Manafort & Stone,
in their brazenness,
really created
the modern sleazeball lobbyist.
They elected people.
As soon as those people were in office,
they lobbied them.
And so they crossed a line
that hadn't been crossed.
Washington's been worse for it ever since.
Paul Manafort
of Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly
stands with his partners
at the receiving end
of $31 million in subsidies.
I will stipulate for the purpose of today
that you could characterize this
as influence peddling.
Thank you.
I will bring new people to Washington.
People that come there to serve
and not to profit.
We will have
the highest possible ethical standards.
We're gonna bring in the best.
The best?
Charles Black is a senior advisor to Bush.
So are Paul Manafort and Roger Stone.
And Lee Atwater is
George Bush's campaign manager.
All these men are partners
in a firm that, in 1985,
received $3.4 million
in foreign lobbying fees.
Black, Manafort & Stone saw
a business opportunity
in being the torturers' lobby.
In representing
the most distasteful dictators,
Mobutu, Marcos, UNITA in Angola.
They did not care about being acceptable
in the salons of Georgetown.
They cared about making money.
You know, one man's freedom fighter
is another man's terrorist.
There are reports of gross
human rights abuses in rebel-held areas,
including the burning alive
of Savimbi's political opponents.
The Cold War was going on.
You know, I'll take criticism
if they give it to Reagan
and the majority of Congress
who put the funding in.
Tens of thousands of men have
been killed or wounded in the fighting.
The US missiles will escalate the war
even to a more deadly level.
When people think
of Washington corruption,
they think of organizations
like Black, Manafort & Stone,
that shook down dictators,
took all their money,
and then tried
to take America's government
and make them serve
the dictators' interest.
You know, it is the swamp.
I'm proud of the job I did
at Black, Manafort & Stone,
because I made a lot of money,
and I can't think of anything I did
that was either illegal or immoral.
You play by the rules as they're written.
When they change the rules,
you change the way you play the game.
When you talk to Roger
about his business and morality,
he sees morality
as a synonym for weakness.
That's something that he's always
going to have contempt for.
Those who say I have no soul,
those who say I have no principles,
are losers. Those are bitter losers.
Everything I have done,
everything I have worked for,
is to propel ideas
and a political philosophy
that I want to see dominant in government.
Donald Trump has now elevated
the issues that I believe in.
Anti-elitism, that was first identified
by Richard Nixon...
To you, the great silent majority...
mined by Ronald Reagan...
Government is not the solution
to our problem,
government is the problem.
And now Donald Trump.
The silent majority is back,
and we're gonna take the country back.
The image they have of politics is
a dirty image of politics.
It's that, um, everybody's for sale.
When Trump talks about, you know,
"I gave my money 'cause I thought
I might need a favor later."
Everyone's for sale.
Nobody's there to serve the public good.
It's an anti-government view
and an anti-political view and, um...
very lacking in idealism, very cynical.
There's no nobility in it.
The money in politics?
Well, I think there should be,
frankly, more transparency.
Because I see a guy
like Jeb Bush with $114 million,
which is now higher,
and nobody even knows
who put the money in.
And they all control him
like a little puppet, okay?
I know half of the people.
I don't know who they are
because I can't find it out.
But as soon as I do,
I will know most of 'em.
They're friends of mine.
I used to be there.
I used to be the king at that, okay?
In 1981, Roger runs Tom Kean's
campaign for governor in New Jersey.
Donald is just really getting into
the throes of casino life
in Atlantic City,
so they came together on a common agenda.
Trump gave him
a lot of casino business.
Roger and Trump, peas in a pod, you know?
Trump is someone, through the '80s,
who took enormous risks and succeeded.
Roger represented Donald Trump
from Donald Trump's earliest days.
Then the Ethics Commission made a finding
against Donald Trump and him
for all of the illegal things
that they did.
When Roger wants something,
he pursues it with vigor.
Now politics, sort of.
New York developer Donald Trump caused
a stir this morning
when he took out an ad
in some major newspapers
charging American foreign policy
lacks backbone.
Immediately the question came up,
is he running for something?
In 1987, I suggested that Trump
should explore a bid for the presidency.
This sounds like political
presidential talk to me,
and I know that people have talked to you
about if you wanna run. Would you ever?
Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing
what's happening with this country.
And if it got so bad,
I would never wanna rule it out totally,
because I really am tired of seeing
what's happening with this country.
I was like a jockey looking for a horse.
You can't win the race
if you don't have a horse,
and he is a prime piece
of political horseflesh in my view.
I interceded with the Portsmouth,
New Hampshire Chamber of Commerce
to arrange a lunch.
The helicopter landing was
as big a news as his speech.
This is kind of the first time
I saw the power of Trump.
The public interest in Trump was palpable.
It was, like, electric.
And he lit the place on fire.
I'm not here today
because I'm running for the presidency.
I'm here because I'm personally tired
of seeing this great country of ours
being ripped off.
Roger always wanted me
to run for president.
And in 1988, he wanted me to run,
but I had no interest.
I did a book called The Art of the Deal,
which was the number one best-seller
of the year.
It was a tremendous book.
Roger wanted me to run so badly,
and I just didn't want to do it.
What I want is, I want extreme competence.
I want strength and extreme competence.
In 1988, when I was
at the New Orleans convention,
Roger Stone had me setting up chairs
in a reception room
for an executive out of New York
who I didn't really know, Donald Trump.
Even though his candidate
for president, Jack Kemp,
had the possibility of being
selected as vice president,
he was squiring Donald Trump
around the convention.
You have said
that if you ran for president, you'd win.
I'd have a very good chance.
I like to win.
When I do something, I like to win.
I like to do well, and I think I probably
would have a pretty good chance.
Roger saw the value of the outsider image.
He saw the value of somebody
who brought business experience
to the political process.
He saw something that nobody else saw
back in the early '80s.
Once he'd had conversations
with Trump about that,
Trump started to take seriously
that maybe he should run.
So long. Thanks a lot, folks.
Florida is a great place to live.
It's a sunny place for shady people.
Welcome to Casa del Stone.
This is, uh, where I live with my wife,
three cats and three dogs.
And my 91-year-old mother.
Tough as nails.
If you ever saw The Sopranos
and you're familiar with Tony's mother,
that's my mother.
These guys are liberal filmmakers.
They cannot be trusted.
Hi.
Come here, Sambo.
Sammy is, uh... He's not well.
He's been losing weight.
And we've been taking him
back and forth to the vet.
Come here, baby. Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss. No kiss? No kiss?
Okay.
This is my wife.
We met working on the Reagan campaign,
where she was employed
as a photographer for the campaign
and I was working for Reagan
as a regional political director.
This is the designated smoking area.
Kind of a contemplative garden.
What do you contemplate out here?
Political strategy
and destroying my enemies.
And now may I introduce
Mr. Roger Stone to all of you.
Bill Clinton is a Bill Cosby-style
sexual predator,
who has preyed on probably hundreds,
but at least 27, individual women.
If Bill Cosby is going to be
held responsible for his actions,
then Bill Clinton should be
held responsible for his actions.
Bill and Hillary Clinton are
the penicillin-resistant syphilis
of the American body politic.
- Everything you're doing.
- Thank you very much. You, too.
- Hey, sir.
- How ya doing?
- Pleasure.
- Good to see you.
This is my daughter and my granddaughter.
Hello. How are you?
I'm excellent.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course. Of course.
I was going to point out that...
There's a side of him that they don't see.
The side we get to see.
The family side, the loving side.
That persona of the dirty trickster
is not what we see at home.
- We do see the trickster.
- Yeah.
Hold up your lens up here
just a little higher.
Little higher. Little higher.
Little higher.
Yeah, that's it. Okay!
I was actually terrified
of him the first time I met him.
I walked in his office,
and I told him later
that he looked like a Nazi Hitler Youth.
Nydia taught me how to smile
and how to laugh.
Uh, and she's made me a better person.
And I'm not complete without her.
You're a Buddhist.
Do you think that you centered Roger?
- Yes.
- She certainly has tried.
And I think, in some cases,
she has been effective in doing so.
Centered and censored.
And sometimes I need both.
And with Nydia, I got instant family.
I got children. I got grandchildren.
I got a mother-in-law.
All things that I didn't have
with my first wife.
So I became a family man overnight.
He is a political strategist,
and he was just named the senior advisor
to the Dole presidential campaign.
That should be an interesting job
in the next few months.
Roger Stone!
Roger...
I think we've got this figured out.
We've got the slogan.
"Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
Together they offer the people
133 years of experience."
We want Bob! We want Bob!
Thank you.
I can't imagine Roger being less excited
to work with a presidential candidate
than he was with Bob Dole.
There are endless reasons to end
the failed presidency of Bill Clinton.
But renewing the strength of America
by restoring our social and moral order
has got to be somewhere
near the top of that list.
The Dole-Kemp ticket was still
counting on the evangelical vote
to defeat the Clintons.
In fact, if you look at
the numbers back then,
there was no way they could win
unless they had that vote.
There's no doubt about it
that many American people have lost
their faith in government.
They see scandals almost on a daily basis.
They see ethical problems
in the White House today.
Do you think
that's a legitimate issue?
I do. I think the character
of the president of the United States...
Do you think this issue
of marital fidelity,
which you keep blaming on the media,
is a legitimate issue?
This is something the voters
are gonna wanna know about, yeah.
Roger could have become
much more successful
in conventional terms than he did.
And the reason he didn't is
because he self-sabotaged.
There was once a time
when political consultants were
unknown and unseen.
No more.
Some of the tabloids say
a Republican strategist, Roger Stone,
a partner in the prestigious
Washington lobbying firm
of Davis, Manafort & Stone,
has been advertising for sex
in swinger magazines
along with his wife, Nydia.
He joins us from Washington.
- Good to have you with us.
- Surely.
Do I quote you correctly,
that these ads were planted
by someone else out to get you?
Yes, indeed, um...
An exhaustive investigation now indicates
that a domestic employee
who I discharged for substance abuse...
on the second time that we learned
that he had a drug problem,
is the perpetrator.
I'm deeply troubled
by this notion of paid sources
who can say anything
anonymously about you.
Provide no photographs,
no proof, no documents.
You know, it's very hard.
My granddaughter, who's seven years old,
said to my wife on Sunday,
"Why are they doing this to you, Grandma?"
It's a very hard question to answer.
All right,
appreciate you joining us.
- Thanks for being here.
- Glad to be here.
Roger Stone's first impulse was to deny.
In fact, if you look at Stone's Rules,
one of the rules is
"deny, deny, deny, deny."
And he began by following his own rules.
'Cause it wasn't until much later that
he admitted that everything was true.
The National Enquirer scandal,
which I'm not interested
in rehashing at great length,
uh, probably required
that I be even more of an outlaw.
I never ran for public office.
So how I conduct myself
in my private life is nobody's business.
Did you hear about this?
This guy, Roger Stone,
top Republican advisor for Bob Dole,
has now been accused
of going to sex clubs with his wife.
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
On the other hand, this gives you an idea
how conservative the Dole campaign is.
This guy is in trouble
for having sex with his wife!
That's how conservative those people are.
Having...
I think something snapped in him
when the swinger scandal happened,
and he got chased out of Washington.
And he just said, "Eff this.
What do I need this for anymore?"
What the '96 scandal meant
is that Roger was never gonna be
the out-front political genius.
The Karl Rove, the David Axelrod.
He was always gonna have to operate
in the shadows.
If it weren't for 1996
and all the trouble he had,
maybe Roger wouldn't have
embraced the kind of, you know,
darker side of his capacity,
of his talents.
If there hadn't been
a sex scandal in 1996,
we might have had a President Al Gore.
They always return
to the scene of the crime.
We want Bush!
We want Bush! We want Bush!
We want Gore! We want Gore!
This is where the recount of
the 2000 presidential contest took place.
This is where the recount ended.
This is where George W. Bush became
president of the United States.
Good grief.
Look at that. Eleven.
Eleven.
That means automatic recount.
There is one state left
to be decided,
and we believe
when those votes are counted
and that process is complete,
totally complete,
Al Gore will have won
the Electoral College and the popular vote
and, therefore, is...
will be the next president.
The hand recount in Florida
will continue, and the votes will count.
That, according to a unanimous ruling
from Florida Supreme Court last night.
Vice President Al Gore praised
the decision, saying,
"It allows for a full and accurate
counting of the ballots."
This is a street fight
for the presidency of the United States.
I want our protestors down there
in Palm Beach, Tallahassee, and Miami.
Call Roger Stone.
In 2000,
my old friend Jim Baker called me
and asked me to go to Miami-Dade
to work on the recount.
I thought it was vitally important
that we matched the Democrats
in terms of protesters who wanted an end
to the 2000 presidential election.
This country was born
on civil disobedience
and the will of the people standing up
against the powerful!
There's nothing wrong
with Clinton getting his dick sucked
in the middle of the Oval Office,
is there?
This is where the trailer was set up
to communicate with our operatives
inside the building.
He's got a ballot!
He stole a ballot!
When some of
my operatives reported
that two democratic commissioners
were attempting to take
a sheaf of ballots,
remove them from the counting room,
which was being viewed by reporters
and lawyers for both sides,
and take them to a small anteroom
without windows,
this is what sparked
the so-called Brooks Brothers Riot.
I said, "Flood the hall
and don't let them shut that door."
Let us in! Let us in!
They started banging on the doors
and were intimidating the people
who were counting the ballots to stop.
And they did stop.
So Al Gore could not gain any votes.
That was critical in making sure
that the results in Florida,
certifying George Bush as the winner,
stood.
Let us in! Let us in!
Most people, they want to underplay
anything they did wrong or improper.
And with Roger,
what you have to worry about
is that he's lying to make himself worse
than he actually was.
The history of the 2000 recount was
essentially written by Roger Stone,
and he wrote himself in,
in a pretty big role.
He was sitting next to Washington
as they crossed the Delaware.
He was with Eisenhower on D-Day.
He was cradling Bobby Kennedy
in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel.
I mean, he really
sort of put himself there.
I mean, Roger was there.
But let me ask you,
is it more brilliant and impressive
to influence world events
or to stand on the periphery
of world events
and yet get recorded
as having influenced world events?
Maybe the latter.
Yeah, I think he played a role
in the Brooks Brothers Riot.
I don't dispute that.
But I'm the only one to approach
what I think is the best story
I've ever done on Roger.
I don't believe George W. Bush would have
ever been president of the United States
if it wasn't for Roger Stone.
We're back now
at 9:40 Eastern Time.
Ross Perot proves to be
a major factor here tonight.
The Bush campaign headquarters in Houston,
they believe that Ross Perot may have
cost them the presidency.
Thank you.
When George H. W. Bush loses
in 1992, we all know the reason he lost.
It was the Reform Party and Ross Perot.
The Reform Party was drawing
a disproportionate number of votes
from the Republicans.
Bill Clinton, the great politician,
he never got 50% in any election.
No Ross Perot, no Bill Clinton.
So when the son is running
in 2000,
and the Reform Party is still
on the ballot
in every state in the United States,
then they're very concerned
about who is going to wind up
the Reform Party candidate for president.
Today, I am ending my lifelong membership
in the Republican Party
and I'm declaring my intention
to seek the nomination of the Reform Party
for the presidency
of the United States of America.
Roger Stone comes up
with the brilliant idea
of getting Pat Buchanan
out of the Republican line
and to get him to run
for the Reform Party.
Yes, I... I encourage him to run,
but I also, yeah, I have an interest in
the Reform Party imploding at that point.
Just when Buchanan hoped
to have the political stage to himself,
he was trumped.
Businessman Donald Trump announcing today,
he too will switch from the GOP
to the Reform Party
and may even seek
its presidential nomination.
And if he does, he says,
it will not be just a publicity stunt
for his empire of office buildings,
casinos and hotels.
He will run to win, he says,
despite his reputation.
When Donald Trump announces
that he's going to run,
it completely throws
everything into chaos.
George, should the American people
take the Reform Party seriously?
Well, not if Donald Trump is their leader.
Donald Trump is being supported
by a fellow named Roger Stone,
who is a longtime political activist
who had worked for Richard Nixon
and Ronald Reagan.
It looks to me like Pat Buchanan
is going to get in the water,
and a Trump-Buchanan race,
it'd be a great race.
It's unexpected.
No one sees it coming.
And to make matters worse,
Trump doesn't exactly run
for the nomination
so much as he runs against Pat Buchanan.
He's a Hitler lover.
I guess he's an anti-Semite.
He doesn't like the blacks.
He doesn't like the gays.
What's wrong with Pat Buchanan?
Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
He's obviously in love
with Adolf Hitler in some form,
and I don't think
the Reform Party should be taking losers.
Have a good time.
Bear in mind that the arch-strategist
of the Trump campaign is Roger Stone.
Do you think that Roger is up to something
here that deserves closer inspection?
Well, Roger's always been a little arch.
Uh, I don't know
that he's the arch-strategist.
Do you think that Trump is just
a stalking horse for, say, George Bush?
Stone goes overnight
from backing Buchanan to backing Trump,
it's very hard not to conclude
that Stone had intended all along
to undermine Buchanan's candidacy
in order to make the Reform nomination
completely untenable,
and thus give Bush
a clearer shot at the presidency.
Political observers this morning
are still wondering
what Donald Trump really wants.
Is he running for president,
or just getting his name
and face on television?
He was in the game enough
to get a tease to the national news media,
and then out of the game.
I'm ashamed of this party!
Political pros say
that to have any impact
on the race for the White House,
the Reform Party will have to shed
its image as a circus.
We will not have mob rule
in this party.
Now, what Roger freely admitted
to me,
is that he had known since the Nixon days
that Pat Buchanan had
an illegitimate child.
Nominating somebody for the president
of the United States
whose name will appear on the ballot
in all 50 states,
who you are blackmailing at the same time
so that he won't really run.
That's not just a dirty trick.
That's a transformation of democracy.
The allegation
that I spread the rumor
that Pat Buchanan had
an illegitimate child,
this all comes from Wayne Barrett.
Wayne Barrett is full of shit.
It's false.
Pat Buchanan got less
than half a percent of the vote.
That was humiliating.
Humiliating for him, for the Reform Party,
and arguably it put the entire third party
campaign effort back by decades.
After the Reform Party cost
the Republicans the White House in '92,
again in '96...
Yeah, I may have played some role
in derailing them as a party.
Roger Stone knows
how to do the triple bank shot.
The one that nobody else can do.
And it ends up changing
the face of a campaign.
Changing the whole tenor of a debate.
Shifting the entire paradigm.
People today say
that they like doing dirty tricks.
They're pikers compared to Roger.
Roger has raised it
to an absolute art form.
Sometimes you confuse me
with the Stephen Colbert character
that I sometimes play called Roger Stone.
Don't... don't confuse him
with the real Roger Stone.
- What's the difference?
- You'll have to sort that out.
Joining me now, Roger Stone,
political consultant and strategist.
And great to see you.
There is a Hillary-Nixon connection
that's very historic and important.
In 1964, Hillary Clinton was fired
from the House Nixon Impeachment Committee
for leaking and lying.
Now, she held this grudge for 40 years.
Hillary repeatedly blocking Nixon
from meeting with Clinton.
Finally, Clinton overrules her.
Nixon and Clinton meet,
and they hit it off.
And Nixon met Hillary.
I said, "Mr. President,
what did you think?"
He said, "She's cold. Cold as ice."
You're doing a documentary?
Yes, this gentleman's doing a documentary.
He's one of those dangerous
liberal, pinko, left-wing...
I hate people like you.
Homosexual, New York Times commies,
but he's not a bad guy.
I know who they are.
Part of the reason
we've always paid attention to Roger,
is he just looks different
from everyone else.
You know, here we have
a bodybuilding dandy.
A category, as far as I'm concerned,
of one.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Prince of Darkness, Roger J. Stone.
I am no longer a Republican.
I joined the Libertarian Party.
I do think he is really alienated
from the contemporary Republican Party.
He is, I think, spiritually,
and now politically, a libertarian.
From the time
that I was a Young Republican,
I always had a libertarian streak.
I have always been pro-choice,
pro-gay marriage, pro-marijuana.
As a Libertarian-Republican,
I've always believed
in gay marriage equality.
It's a civil right that equal access
is guaranteed by the Constitution.
So, uh, I'm going
to the Gay Pride parade today.
Let's welcome
the Log Cabin Republicans!
The Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's
only organization of Republicans
who support fairness, freedom and equality
for gay and lesbian Americans.
He may have,
as a result of his personal life,
some authentic beliefs
at the age of 60 or 61.
I think he's internalized
some of the gay rights agenda.
I think he's internalized
some of the pro-drug agenda.
After the scandal devours him in 1996...
Since he's been rejected
and essentially thrown out
of mainstream Republican politics,
he doesn't really have any choice
but to figure out some third-party avenue.
And so he's looking for a reprise of 2000.
He's looking to see if he can find
an angle where he can matter.
I've stayed away from Roger, personally,
because he's so charming,
and you can see the ways
in which he distorts the reporters
who are around that charm.
At the same time, there's no way
to avoid writing about him,
since he's been everywhere dark and ugly
in our politics for many, many years.
In 2004, he's blamed
for forging the documents
that destroyed Dan Rather's career
and also helped re-elect President Bush.
Roger Stone,
an old dirty trickster
from the Nixon days,
may have been involved in the production
of these documents.
Look, politics is
a rough-and-tumble business,
but this is just a cheap shot.
That same year, Stone consulted
for Al Sharpton's presidential run
that helped disrupt
the Democratic primary process.
What Stone is in this for,
is to use Sharpton as a disruptive force.
Some out there
who follow presidential politics
ascribe to you magical powers,
consider you the puppet master
of the Sharpton campaign.
Look, Roger's always been an outlaw
and drawn to like-minded outlaws,
like Sharpton, like Trump.
I don't think that's changed at all.
What's changed is the country.
A few years later, he took credit
for bringing down his nemesis,
New York governor Eliot Spitzer.
I am deeply sorry that I did not live up
to what was expected of me.
I am resigning
from the office of governor.
He says he got a tip
from a hooker in a sex club.
You had heard that the governor
liked to wear his socks
when he engaged in sexual activities?
I ask you, Dominic, what kind of guy
does it with his socks on?
Sounds like Eliot Spitzer to me.
Roger understands
the dark heart of the media
even better than we understand ourselves
sometimes.
Because if he tells us
that Eliot Spitzer was wearing black socks
when he had sex,
he knew that that would be irresistible,
even if it had absolutely nothing
to do with the truth at all.
What do you say to people who say,
"It's awfully convenient
that you happened to meet a prostitute
who was involved with Eliot Spitzer,
given your animus toward Eliot Spitzer"?
Uh, there are skeptics everywhere.
Stone's so desperate to stay
in the public eye,
that he peddles
garbage conspiracy theories.
Like the supposed tape
of Michelle Obama saying "whitey."
Roger, you can't just say that
and say you have no proof for it
and make a comment like that.
No, no, no. Let me finish.
And worse,
the now infamous "birther" lie
that President Barack Obama is
a secret Muslim
and a Manchurian president
who wasn't really born in America.
Donald Trump's one of the last
people that was still touting that,
because Roger Stone and he
were conspiring one day
and Roger giggled
and rubbed his hands together and said,
"I can get the real birth certificate
from Kenya."
And Trump, you know, went and believed it.
If he wasn't born in this country,
- it's one of the great scams of all time.
- Absolutely.
- But I don't think that's the case.
- Well, you don't...
There's something on that
birth certificate that he doesn't like.
Oh, my God!
That's a terrible thing to say!
Have you ever heard of any white president
asked to be shown their birth certificate?
When you become a president
of the United States of America,
you know that he is American.
I'm sorry, that's BS.
Why is Donald Trump so happy
to throw himself into the "birther" pool?
Longtime Trump casino lobbyist
and GOP advisor Roger Stone told Politico.
"Personally, I think it is brilliant.
It's base building.
It gives voice to a concern
shared by many on the right."
Is there such a thing as coded appeals
to racist sentiment?
- There is such a thing.
- Of course, but I see none here.
Okay, as far as you're concerned.
The whole "birther" movement,
which was so crazy
and so wrong and so racist,
that is the basis
of Trump's political appeal.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am officially running...
For president of the United States,
and we are going to make
our country great again.
What's your precise role
with Donald Trump?
- Are you a paid advisor?
- Uh... I am now.
I'm just helping as a general
communications strategist, I guess.
People get the impression that this is
performance art for Donald Trump.
Is he serious about being
president of the United States?
I will build a great, great wall
on our southern border,
and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
- Yes!
- Mark my words.
Is this a president talking?
If there is one murder,
if there is one crime by someone
who is not supposed to be in the country,
that's one crime too many.
I think Trump has identified
a legitimate hot-button issue.
"Donald J. Trump is calling
for a total and complete shutdown"
of Muslims entering the United States
"until our country's representatives
can figure out what the hell is going on."
Roger Stone came to power
with Nixon.
And Nixon, of course,
had the Southern strategy,
which was all about milking
people's racial resentments,
and in the case of Trump,
anti-immigrant resentments.
Working up hate that would turn them
against the government
and against the so-called elites
who were in government.
The political system is a cesspool.
I've been a lobbyist.
I worked on the Senate side.
I worked on the House side.
I saw how the sausage are made.
The whole process is deeply corrupt.
Trump is the only one
who can clean it up.
Trump! Trump! Trump!
Trump! Trump! Trump!
We are going to Washington, DC,
and we are going to do what?
Drain the swamp.
It is so corrupt.
The best part is that he's just kicking
the political establishment in the balls.
They are shitting a brick,
because he's challenging the status quo.
All these other candidates are really
for the status quo.
Roger's the ultimate insider,
which makes him incredibly good at seeing
how to package someone
he could sell as an outsider.
We are going to stand up
for the American worker
like nobody has ever stood up
for that worker before.
There is real upset over jobs,
over globalization,
over people losing their sort of status
and their incomes.
You know, there are all kinds of answers
to these questions,
but the answers that he's provided,
for the most part,
are the answers
that billionaires are interested in.
We're also going to eliminate
job-killing regulations.
And lift the restrictions
on the production of American energy,
including shale, oil, natural gas
and beautiful, clean coal.
There's no grassroots movement
to gut the EPA
and give people dirty water and dirty air.
The only people who are really caring
about that are the polluting industries.
They say I have the most loyal people.
Did you ever see that?
Where I could stand
in the middle of Fifth Avenue
and shoot somebody,
and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?
It's, like, incredible.
Roger understands
that I've always gotten great ratings,
whether it's on The Apprentice
or virtually any interview,
and that's why people want
to interview me.
And I think that's one of the things
that's always fascinated Roger,
because, ultimately,
it is all about the ratings
and it is all about people watching
and the eyeballs.
Mr. Trump, you've called women
you don't like "fat pigs,"
"dogs," "slobs," and "disgusting animals."
- Your Twitter account...
- Only Rosie O'Donnell.
Unlike every other candidate
I have ever worked with,
he is unscripted, he is unrehearsed,
he is unhandled.
Contrast that with Jeb Bush,
who looks both bored and annoyed,
like, "Just... This is mine.
Just anoint me and give it to me."
Father, Father, tell them
it's my turn to be king."
Roger, before you go,
uh, will you remain with the Donald
now throughout the campaign?
I'll do whatever the Donald asks me to do.
Good evening. It's been 48 hours
since the first
Republican presidential debate,
and a testy exchange between Donald Trump
and moderator Megyn Kelly
has become a flash point in the campaign.
You know, you could see there was
blood coming out of her eyes, uh,
blood coming out of her wherever.
Now members of the Republican field
are lining up to criticize him.
And word this evening that an advisor
and a longtime friend of Trump's
has resigned from the campaign.
Trump says he fired him.
Roger Stone's a nice guy,
but I let him go
because I really wasn't using him,
and he liked to get a lot of publicity
for himself, which I didn't want.
He's real, he's genuine,
and it's entertaining.
That's why he's doing so well.
- So why'd he fire you?
- He didn't. I quit.
"Oh, you can't fire me. I quit!"
Did he get fired or did he quit?
I don't know.
He still hasn't admitted to me
that he got fired,
and I've tried numerous times.
"Bullshit, you got fired. Come on."
"No, no, no!"
Because Roger, you know,
Roger the feminist, was really offended
about what Trump said about Megyn Kelly.
I don't need the Trump campaign
to generate press coverage for myself,
and I can get in the tabloids
any time I want.
But to say that you want me
to work on your campaign,
but you don't want me
to talk to reporters
would be like saying to me,
"I just don't want you to breathe air
between now and November."
If you could just agree
not to breathe any air
"or eat any food,
everything will be fine."
Talking to reporters is what I do.
That's my value.
- Roger Stone and I don't agree on anything.
- I don't...
- He does not represent the Trump campaign.
- Not what he says.
What Roger Stone says
and what the truth are
are two factually very different things.
There's no question
Lewandowski worked behind the scenes
to get Roger thrown out of the campaign.
He is an expert
at stabbing people in the back.
That guy's got an incredible capacity
for treachery.
By the way, I spoke
to a Polish language expert the other day.
I was unaware of the fact
that Lewandowski, loosely translated,
means "cocksucker."
Well, Roger is a tough guy,
and Roger will make enemies sometimes
that I always say,
there's no reason for it.
Roger is older now,
and I think he sees the Trump campaign,
at once as his creation,
but also something that he's not allowed
to participate in day to day.
And that, understandably, makes him sad.
I have no interest in going back.
Although I strongly support Trump,
we have managerial differences.
And, meanwhile, I'm just making the very
best case for him in public that I can,
'cause I do think he has what it takes.
There's always this tension
between the candidate and his consultant.
The candidate resents the credit
the consultant gets for his words.
The consultant resents, you know,
the fame and fortune the candidate gets
when he did all the work.
And Trump hated the fact
that Stone was showing up on cable news
and that people were, you know,
calling him Trump's brain.
So he fired him.
But it doesn't mean
he stopped relying on him.
It seems to me
there is more than meets the eye here
with Roger Stone parting company
from the Trump campaign,
coming on my program and others
and giving the big Trump pitch.
You media types are so conspiratorial.
No. No, the Stone-Trump types,
I think, are the conspiratorial.
Unlike...
Only two campaigns have a plausible path
to the nomination.
Ours and Donald Trump's.
Nobody else has
any mathematical possibility, whatsoever.
L-Y-I-N-apostrophe, lyin' Ted!
The Bible held high,
he puts it down and then he lies.
Most of the time,
I win the evangelical vote.
The evangelicals,
the Christians, like Donald Trump.
I'm a straight shooter.
After a crushing
13-point defeat in Wisconsin,
Trump turned a page,
sidelining campaign manager
Corey Lewandowski.
He wasn't as effective
for the last couple of months.
News breaking
that the GOP front-runner, by the way,
has hired Paul Manafort
to lead his campaign's convention efforts.
Paul Manafort, former partner of mine,
the single best vote counter
and convention strategist
in the Republican Party.
When Paul Manafort got publicly named,
I got a phone call that day.
And it was Roger
on the other end of the line.
And you know what he sang?
"Back in the Saddle Again."
I mean, Roger knows what Roger's doing.
Trump asked me to get involved
because my reputation,
among other things in politics,
is understanding of the convention
process, the delegate process.
And most of the major
successful big conventions
over the last 30 years,
I've been intimately involved in.
Did Roger recommend you
for the job?
Roger was one of the two or three people
who strongly recommended me, yes.
Even after Roger stopped being
the principal political advisor to Trump,
he continued to be
a very important advisor,
and is to this day.
I want to start
with Roger Stone,
because you just launched
a pro-Trump super PAC.
I thought, A, Donald Trump
didn't like super PACs,
B, I thought you quit or he fired you.
I'm not still sure what happened there.
So what the heck is this all about, Roger?
Roger told me when I was very young,
"Caputo," he says,
"The media is two things."
They're either evil or they're lazy,
or they're both.
"And if you understand that,
you can do whatever you want."
Yeah, I live a pretty Machiavellian life,
and I'm a skeptic.
I tend to believe the worst of people
because I understand human nature.
Human nature has never changed.
That's why one of Stone's Rules
is that hate
is a stronger motivator than love.
That's because it is.
The National Enquirer
published a story.
It is a story that quoted one source
on the record, Roger Stone.
Let me be clear.
This National Enquirer story is garbage.
And it is a smear that has come
from Donald Trump and his henchmen.
One of the keys to defeating
an opponent is getting inside their head.
He incorrectly claims
that I am the source of this story
regarding allegations
that he has been adulterous.
And I would note
that Mr. Stone is a man
who has 50 years
of dirty tricks behind him.
He's a man for whom a term was coined...
for copulating with a rodent.
I, of course, am quoted in this story,
on the record,
saying that it would hurt him badly
with his evangelical followers.
He has, as you know, attacked me on CNN...
Roger Stone has been
Donald Trump's chief political advisor.
He planned and ran
his presidential campaign.
Attacked me on Megyn Kelly.
His entire business has been dirty tricks,
has been lies, has been personal smears.
These attacks on me by him
and by his surrogates,
I find this most satisfying.
I hope he's laying awake at night,
worrying about what I'm going to do next.
He's a little bit like the Joker
in Batman.
I mean, he gets a kick out of doing this.
To some extent, his pleasure
at burning down the house
is infectious for people.
And as a reporter, you call him up
because you want the outrageous quote.
You want, you know...
You want to hear what he's gonna say.
He's also very plugged-in.
He's in the know.
He talks to a million people.
I just got a call from
this reporter who was calling to warn me
that Corey is now openly telling people
he's got the goods on Manafort.
He is telling reporters
that he has something on Manafort
that will blow him out of the campaign.
Yeah, we gotta take the little prick out.
I've been backgrounding reporters on
what a total fucking disaster he's been.
And there's a story that just went up
by Mike Isikoff at Yahoo
that dips into the whole Pakistani
blah, blah, blah.
If you look at Manafort's
long history of lobbying,
it is about as controversial
as you can get.
You are as connected to the insider game
of, what you've even said
on record yourself,
"influence peddling," as anybody.
How can you be the antidote
or anything to help Trump
when you seem to go against
his main message?
It depends on who you talk to
if I'm part of the establishment
or part of the antiestablishment.
You better get rid of the super PACs
because they're causing a big problem
with this country.
And a lot of bad decisions
that are being made
for the benefit of lobbyists
and special interests.
Donald Trump tells America
the system is rigged
by the lobbyists and the super PAC money,
and who does he turn to as his top guys?
Roger Stone and Paul Manafort,
who literally put up that rigging.
It's a crooked system,
it's a system that's rigged,
and we're going to go back to the old way.
It's called "You Vote and You Win."
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.
Donald Trump is riding
a crest of voter anger
over 30 years of failed policies.
Voter anger explains
the entire rise of Trump.
I love the old days.
You know what they used to do to guys like
that when they were in a place like this?
They'd be carried out
on a stretcher, folks.
Go fucking make my tortilla, motherfucker,
and build that fucking wall for me!
Trump!
Trump! Trump! Trump!
Roger Stone, he's very smart about anger.
It's one of the things
he understands best.
It's angry, white working-class voters
whose resentments are being milked
to push an agenda that's useful to
some of the richest people in the country.
These are hardly people who are in tune
with the little guy's interests.
Um, but they understand how to manipulate
the little guy's interests.
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can.
- Can you hear me?
- You're awesome.
Easy on the rape stuff. Let's not...
I'll do the best I can, but...
- I know, I know. Let's just, like...
- Facts are facts, you know?
Do you believe it's too early
for Trump to be bringing up Bill Clinton?
Should Trump save all of this
and wait until he's the nominee and
he's running against her in the general?
No, I don't agree.
I don't think he had any choice,
'cause he didn't bring this up.
Hillary Clinton brought it up when
she attempted to play the victim card.
Does he know everything
that's in your book?
Are you giving him information at all?
Well, as you know,
and it's been well documented,
she went after the women
very, very strongly and very viciously,
according to the women
and according to other sources.
Uh, a major book's been written about it.
And it's a book
that's a very well-respected book.
If you read Roger's blog,
The Stone Zone, or follow him on Twitter,
it's like coming attractions
for the attacks Donald Trump
will be launching two weeks later.
It is Hillary who hires
the heavy-handed private detectives
who break into these women's homes
and ransack them,
who threaten their children,
who kill their pets.
She's married to a man
who was the worst abuser of women
in the history of politics.
And Hillary was an enabler,
and she treated these women horribly.
Roger's, you know, relationship with Trump
has been so interconnected
that it's hard to define
what's Roger and what's Donald.
While it'll be clearly a Trump presidency,
I think it's influenced
by a Stone philosophy.
Shake-up at the Trump campaign
as the campaign manager,
Corey Lewandowski,
has now parted ways with the campaign.
Paul Manafort taking the reins
of the Trump campaign.
Well, let's see.
Is it a surprise that Paul Manafort
wound up as
the campaign chairman for Trump?
No, of course not.
That was engineered by Roger
as a way to get Corey Lewandowski
bounced out of the campaign.
It took a couple months, but they did it.
Roger has had a guiding hand
in all of this.
Now, Trump is hard to guide.
He spits the bit out.
You know,
he doesn't want to be driven at all.
But Roger's had as much influence
on the campaign as anyone.
I think the campaign's
being professionalized.
Manafort's doing a phenomenal job.
I think he instills confidence
in the campaign
that they didn't have before.
Did you give any reporters
background on Lewandowski?
No.
Just stay silent!
Just stay silent! Just stay silent!
Just stay silent!
Just stay silent!
How often do you talk to him?
Uh, from time to time.
Are you an informal advisor?
Would you call yourself that?
I'm just an FOT, Friend of Trump.
We need, in our country, law and order.
And if I'm elected president,
that will happen.
How real is the Dump Trump
movement inside the Republican Party?
It's real because you've got,
now, an attitude
within the Republican Party,
at the highest levels,
that this would be better for the party.
Discussions about
cutting Trump loose
are focused on the Republican Convention.
Finding a way to free delegates for Trump
to vote for someone else.
I could see Donald Trump going
to the convention in Cleveland
and having the nomination stolen from him.
So, I have set up a convention operation
to try to ensure
that the Republican nomination
is not stolen from Donald Trump.
I'm representing a tremendous
many, many millions of people.
I think you would have problems
like you've never seen before.
I think bad things would happen.
I think you'd have riots.
I have warned the public
of what I believe is "the big steal."
We're going to have protests.
We will disclose the hotels
and the room numbers
of those delegates
who are directly involved in the steal.
What about the issue
of Donald Trump's hit man, Roger Stone,
threatening violence in Cleveland?
- Appropriate rhetoric?
- I'm not giving him my hotel room.
Okay, so do you sort of...
Roger is not an official part
of the campaign.
- Did he bring you in? Okay.
- No. In fact, not at all.
Roger Stone threatened yesterday
that he will send Donald Trump supporters
to the hotel rooms
of any Republican delegate
who tries stealing
the nomination from Trump this summer.
And those delegates
will probably answer the door, too,
because they're expecting a prostitute.
"Hey!"
- Caputo.
- How are you, man?
- I'm good.
- What's going on?
- Thank you. One more photo?
- All right. Give 'em hell.
Mr. Stone.
- How are you?
- Thank you for your years of service.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it. That's very kind.
Make America great again.
I'm very sorry,
but I am not gonna do this again.
Delegates were denied
an opportunity to vote on the rules.
Some saw it as their last chance
to take the nomination from Trump.
We want Trump! We want Trump!
Trump is able to take over
the Republican Party
because the Republican Party is
a bit like the Reform Party in 2000.
It's become a shell.
When it's something which is
so out of touch with its own voters,
someone who steps in
and communicates through social media
straight into television,
with tremendous charisma,
is able to steal the party.
One half of the Trump story
is the story about how one man's ego
led him to take over the Republican Party.
The other half of the story is
how the Republicans became so hollow
that someone could do that to them.
The Trump campaign is the apotheosis
of Roger Stone's politics.
America!
It's the part of
the Republican Party that he represents:
Toughness, anger,
not being politically correct.
If you look at the crime rate
in places like Chicago,
it's out of control, yes.
Trump is the law and order candidate.
He does speak to the silent majority.
I'm here with Roger Stone,
the one and only.
Kind of a legend in political consulting,
and, I think fair to say,
one of the, if not the, architect
of the Trump movement.
You've had an interesting career,
because you were in
the kind of establishment political world
and you had a great career there.
Then you kind of went off
into your Stone world for a while.
And now you're back.
Now you're a big deal.
We're now in the age of Stone.
I mean, I feel like it's come
all the way around,
back to the days when you and I
and Terry Dolan
were plotting a takedown
of the establishment.
Then we became the establishment.
Then we became antiestablishment.
Roger is a lot more
than a dirty tricks artist.
He kind of grabs that persona.
It's like his pro wrestling name.
But in the real world of politics,
he's a real strategist.
And I think whenever he kind of creates
the dirty trickster thing for the media,
he's having fun,
but he's slumming a little bit.
You're a rape denier!
You're a rape denier!
America may be collapsing
and breaking apart,
but Roger Stone is determined to enjoy it.
This for you, right here. It's "rape."
It's Bill Clinton. It says "rape."
Okay, you know
who does this kind of shirt?
First of all, a sick guy.
Get him, Stone! Come on!
You know who's accused in court papers
of being a rapist?
- Donald J. Trump!
- By Jane Doe.
By Jane and Tiffany Doe.
- Jane Doe. Who's Jane Doe?
- It's in court papers.
- You're a sick man, Roger Stone.
- No. You're a liar. Stone-cold liar.
- You're the biggest liar.
- No.
- You're a piece of...
- Spitzer, he's a great guy?
First of all, Alex,
this ain't your fucking show.
And, Roger,
it surely ain't your fucking show!
Blowjob! Blowjob! Blowjob!
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!
You're a hatchet man. I don't know why
anyone in the media takes you seriously.
You're a lightweight.
You don't know anything.
All you do is lie.
You're known as the biggest liar in media.
- Name the lie.
- The biggest liar in media.
Name a lie, loser.
There's nobody watching your show, dude.
The guy starts pointing at me
and yelling like a maniac.
"You're a liar! A proven liar!"
I say, "What have I lied about?"
He says, "Eliot Spitzer."
I said, "He didn't like hookers?
He doesn't like to choke women?"
Don't you read the newspapers, dude?"
Roger doesn't want
to be considered a sweetheart.
He's gonna be considered
the Prince of Darkness.
And if he dies with that on his tombstone,
I think he'll consider himself a success.
- I wanted to say hello.
- Hey. How are you?
You remember...
Roger's relationship with Trump,
they both see the world
in a very similar way.
If Trump is elected president,
I think Roger will see
one more very significant impact
he's had on world history.
I could not be
more proud tonight
to present to you and to all of America,
my father and our next president,
Donald J. Trump.
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans,
I humbly and gratefully accept
your nomination
for the presidency of the United States.
USA! USA! USA!
I would argue that Roger Stone,
after 30 years working for Donald Trump,
is one of his primary influences,
perhaps the primary influence.
And to think that the guy who calls out
people on Twitter like Roger does,
who's done the things
and told the stories,
is actually in the catbird seat
with a Republican nominee
is something for the record books.
CNN has banned Roger Stone,
the Republican strategist
and former Trump advisor,
from appearing as a guest.
This after the discovery of his offensive
tweets against CNN contributors.
Stone once called Ana Navarro
an "abusive diva"
and "borderline retarded."
Stone also called
then-contributor Roland Martin
a "stupid negro," a "moron" and a "token,"
and suggested he eat more fried chicken.
To ban someone
because you disagree with their views
demonstrates you're not really
a news organization,
but you're an opinion organization.
CNN means Clinton News Network.
There are more people
watching Infowars.com
than watching MSNBC and, at some hours,
CNN combined.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are broadcasting worldwide.
Roger Stone, the consummate Trump insider,
the vice-Trumpian joins us.
You've got Alex Jones, he's like
the sort of main conspiracy theorist,
probably the most popular
in American life now.
You know, Roger Stone goes
on that show every day.
There's this crazy vortex
of all that stuff back from the '90s
just now sort of exploding
through the channel of Trump.
I'm never a lesser-of-two-evils person,
but with Hillary,
there's not even the same universe.
I mean, she is an abject,
psychopathic demon from hell.
Alex Jones is very important.
I realize the elite media likes
to call him a conspiracy theorist.
I don't like 'em putting chemicals
in the water
that turns the frickin' frogs gay!
Do you understand that?
I'm sick of this crap!
He has a bully pulpit that
allows him to reach millions of people,
and they are Trump's people.
They are outsiders,
skeptical about government,
skeptical about the bullshit
government is always trying to peddle you.
Mexico is a globalist client state.
And they teach 'em,
"America belongs to you.
You're gonna get the gringo.
Plan of San Diego."
Don't know what that is?
It's a plan to take over in a race war
and kill all whites below the age of 16.
Sure it's a non-elitist crowd,
but they're Americans and they vote.
Tell us, Mr. Trump, about Mr. Stone,
who helped get this interview set up.
Well, Roger's a good guy,
and he is a patriot.
He's a tough cookie, but people like him.
But he's been so loyal and so wonderful.
And thank God for the Breitbarts
and the Daily Callers
and the Townhalls and the Infowars.com
and the so many alternative media sites
where we can learn the truth
and we can tell the truth
and we can spread the truth.
This is not conservatism
as we have known it.
This is not Republicanism
as we have known it.
These are racist ideas,
race-baiting ideas,
anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-women.
All key tenets making up the emerging
racist ideology known as the alt-right.
I think Trump should get more,
you know, more, quote, "conspiratorial."
We created ISIS.
The vacuum created by George W. Bush
and then Hillary Clinton armed ISIS.
ISIS is honoring President Obama.
He is the founder of ISIS.
He's the founder of ISIS.
I would say the cofounder
would be Crooked Hillary Clinton,
cofounder.
I think it's whatever Roger Stone e-mails
Donald Trump in the middle of the night.
- He wakes up, and that's their strategy.
- That's right.
Excuse me.
So go online and put down
"Hillary Clinton illness."
Take a look at the videos for yourself.
This fringe allegation
that Hillary Clinton is not well,
her health isn't good,
is something that we're seeing
more and more
with Donald Trump supporters.
Some of the Breitbart readers
have brought it up.
Also, Roger Stone has been
talking about it.
She's got no stamina.
I think it's abundantly clear.
She doesn't have the strength
or the stamina
to make America great again. Believe me.
The people behind Trump's candidacy,
including Giuliani, including Roger Ailes,
including Roger Stone,
including his so-called brain trust,
believe this stuff works.
Now the children's table
is the adult table.
And Alex Jones is, you know,
passing the dinner rolls.
And we're all conspiracy America now.
Thank you.
Even if Donald Trump loses, I still win,
because the Stone brand has been
front and center,
and my brand of politics
have finally come into their own.
CNN, MSNBC, they're now the fringe.
Alt-right communications,
we are the mainstream.
Did Trump really believe that
Obama was not born in the United States?
Does Roger Stone really believe
that Bill Clinton raped all these women?
You know, it doesn't matter to them
is more the point.
It's their tactic in the political wars.
And for them, there are no boundaries.
Anything goes. Anything that wins, fine.
Today, WikiLeaks releasing
1,700 new stolen e-mails.
The Clinton campaign
is accusing a top Trump advisor
of scheming with WikiLeaks
and Russian intelligence
against Hillary Clinton.
I, actually,
have communicated with Assange.
I believe the next tranche
of his documents
pertain to the Clinton Foundation.
Have you spoken
with the WikiLeaks founder?
No, I have not spoken to Mr. Assange,
I have not met with Mr. Assange,
and I never said I had.
House Democrats now saying
in Washington,
"Let's investigate Roger Stone's ties
to the Russians."
Has the FBI interviewed Roger Stone about
his communications with Julian Assange,
or his knowledge of how WikiLeaks
got these illegally obtained documents?
I can't comment on that.
Only Mr. Assange knows
what he's going to do.
Now, I think he's a hero,
fighting the deep state,
taking on both the Republicans
and the Democrats.
Taking on the establishment, really.
Law enforcement sources tell CNN
that the FBI has been conducting
multiple investigations
and it continues to examine allegations
against Roger Stone, a Trump supporter,
about possible connections to WikiLeaks.
Those probes include
a year-long investigation
of Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort
and his firm and their alleged ties
to pro-Putin figures in Ukraine.
These cyberattacks come
from the highest levels of the Kremlin,
and they are designed
to influence our election.
I find that deeply disturbing,
and I think it's time...
- She has no idea whether it's Russia...
- you take a stand...
China, or anybody else.
- I'm not quoting myself. I'm quoting 17...
- Hillary, you have no idea.
The Clinton thugs,
they're the ones saying,
"Donald Trump is a traitor to his country,
in bed with Vladimir Putin,"
a man he's never even met.
Russia, if you're listening,
I hope you're able to find
the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.
It's the low road in American politics.
They have unabashedly embraced
the toughest tactics you can take.
And you can see it in Roger Stone,
and you can see it in Trump.
I mean, no boundaries
to what they would do.
They'll twist the truth if they need to.
They're cynical about politics.
They think people who take the high road
or who try to act virtuously are chumps.
The Trump campaign's latest reboot
now underway.
Two new top officials
who Trump is bringing in.
Pollster Kellyanne Conway
as campaign manager,
and Breitbart News honcho Steve Bannon
to be Trump's new campaign CEO.
Sources say Manafort is being,
quote, "sidelined."
Another bombshell
from the Trump campaign today.
The resignation of the embattled
campaign chairman Paul Manafort,
amid a wave of bad headlines
and growing questions
about Manafort's connections to Russia.
Also added to the team is
the disgraced Fox News chief Roger Ailes,
and also Roger Stone,
who is a political operative.
Roger Ailes, Roger Stone, Steve Bannon,
they play rough.
Bannon is a bomb thrower
in the Stone mold.
Somebody I like enormously. He's got guts.
He understands new media in a way that
I think no one else
in the Trump campaign did.
He understands the fine points
of the Clinton oeuvre, if you will.
Uh, he has republished
all of my toughest material
from The Clintons' War on Women
at Breitbart News.
So he understands the enemy
better than, perhaps,
anybody else in the Trump campaign.
And like Donald Trump, he's fearless.
He's tough as nails. He's driven.
Uh, I think he's the campaign's
secret weapon at this point.
Good evening, everybody.
It is now established,
this is indeed the dirtiest
presidential campaign in modern history.
The last four weeks
of the campaign,
Roger Stone said it's going to be brutal.
Earlier today, the Washington Post
released audio of Donald Trump from 2005.
Kind of relevant to people
whether their future president
happens to also be a sexist pig.
A new poll reveals
how much that tape of Donald Trump
is hurting his poll numbers.
Breitbart and Roger Stone are
in Donald Trump's head
telling him, "You need to go
all-out scorched-earth."
Bill Clinton sexually assaulted
innocent women,
and Hillary Clinton attacked
those women viciously.
I expect in the fall that many
of these women will be speaking out.
Bill Clinton raped me,
and Hillary Clinton threatened me.
Kathy Shelton was paid $2,500
in May
by a pro-Trump super PAC
run by Roger Stone.
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
Mine are words and his was action.
After the most recent debate,
Clinton leads 49 to 41.
You've got Roger Stone running out there
saying that the system is rigged
and that there'll be revolution
and blood in the streets.
It's just awfully good that someone
with the temperament of Donald Trump
is not in charge of the law
in our country.
Because you'd be in jail.
FBI director
James Comey announced
the bureau is renewing its investigation
into her personal e-mail server.
Crooked Hillary Clinton.
It's not clear
if the tightening in the polls stems
from FBI director James Comey's
widely condemned disclosure.
Donald Trump has taken this country
to the brink.
And tomorrow,
voters are likely to take it back.
Good morning to you.
576 days campaigning,
more than 280 campaign events
and now this historic day is finally here.
Hillary Clinton calls this election
the test of our time.
In Rochester, New York,
dozens put "I voted" stickers
on the grave
of suffragist Susan B. Anthony
on the day the first woman nominee
for president
with a major party was on the ballot.
We're looking at the first woman president
of the United States.
Aren't you excited
for the first female president?
- No!
- I am.
We can't go for Crooked Clinton.
We can't go for her.
If Hillary Clinton can run for president,
can you do anything?
Yeah.
Hillary Clinton is favored
to win today.
The polls have all shown her ahead
by four points or so.
I'm not fatalist.
I just see them with CNN, ABC,
all about how Hillary's gonna win all day.
And I see they're pre-scripting
she's gonna win.
They're very hopeful.
They're optimistic.
A glass ceiling they're hoping to,
symbolically, burst through tonight.
Super excited. I wanna make sure
that I'm here to experience history.
What we see from the early returns is that
her ground game has really delivered.
Let me tell you this,
it is Florida, Florida, Florida.
Donald Trump has taken
the lead in Florida.
I talked to some of my colleagues
in Trump Tower just a few minutes ago.
There's a little optimism here.
No one thought it was gonna be
this close at this point.
Trump can still win this.
We have another state
to project.
It is North Carolina.
Battleground state.
It's going to Donald Trump.
I was actually ready to go to bed,
uh, then I started seeing
the Electoral College come in,
and I'm, like, super psyched.
This is going to be a very close election.
I'm seeing
these late-breaking trends.
This could hand Trump the presidency.
Folks, this is not, by any means, over.
I think there's some real jitters setting
in at Clinton headquarters right now.
Wolf, the scene here is so different
than it was a few hours ago
when people were happy and relaxed.
This is most unexpected.
It certainly is a huge, huge surprise
to so many people out there...
I think we all thought
it couldn't happen,
that he couldn't do what he did.
And guess what?
He may just do it.
Donald Trump has taken
the lead. He has 216 electoral votes.
The beginning of the end
for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
He's pulling ahead
of Hillary Clinton.
You see it there, 222...
a number of groups who are
likely feeling real fear right now.
You've got women, immigrants,
who have been threatened
by Donald Trump with deportation.
How do I explain this to my children?
I have Muslim friends
who are texting me tonight,
saying, "Should I leave the country?"
America is crying tonight.
I'm not sure how much of America,
but a very, very significant portion.
And I mean literally crying.
Trump! Trump! Trump!
This is a very unexpected turn,
and now, his crowd here is saying,
"President Trump, President Trump,"
and there is
vast celebration going on here.
Donald Trump will be
the 45th president of the United States.
Ah, yeah.
The basket of deplorables
has arrived.
People have talked
about a miracle.
I'm hearing about a nightmare.
USA! USA!
This is your life now.
This is us. This is our country.
Stone's Rule.
"Past is fucking prologue."
"Silent majority,"
"the forgotten Americans."
"I am the candidate of law and order."
It's not me who found this trend.
It's those who went before me.
I just saw Trump's ability to utilize it
to become president.
This is the manifestation
of a dream I've had since 1988.
And I've always thought Donald Trump had
the size and the courage and the balls
to become president of the United States.
We're in the age of Stone
because the change in our politics,
the rough-and-tumble cutthroat politics,
the slash-and-burn of what was just
probably the dirtiest, nastiest campaign
in American political history,
are now in vogue.
What message would you have
for the viewers of this film
who will loathe you when the credits roll?
I revel in your hatred,
because if I weren't effective,
you wouldn't hate me.
Equal rights! Equal rights!
