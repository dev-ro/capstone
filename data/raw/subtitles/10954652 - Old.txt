Sing it, girl.
Mom, now I can't.
Her spontaneity
has been stripped from her.
I'm sorry.
You have such a beautiful voice.
I can't wait to hear it
when you're older.
Will this place
have scuba diving?
How old does a child have to be
to do scuba diving?
I don't know, Trent.
I think you're a bit too young.
You're a baby.
You said five minutes.
Technically, it's been way,
way more than five minutes.
Are we close?
Stop wishing away this moment.
Look out the window.
Look how pretty it is.
Prisca.
Work stuff?
Yeah.
Lead by actions, Mom.
Wow.
This is
much better than Cancún.
Mr. and Mrs. Capa,
welcome to our version
of paradise.
Wow.
Hello.
So, this is Madrid.
She'll take care of you.
From your food and beverage
preferences you selected,
we've made you cocktails
to welcome you.
Wow.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Look how big you guys are.
We have a drink fountain
for you two.
Can we go?
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Let's go. Let's go.
Can you believe
I found this online?
My favorite thing:
open 24 hours,
the candy station.
Oh, my God. Come on, Trent.
Mix the vanilla
and strawberry in it.
Say hi, Trent.
Hi.
I'm Idlib.
My uncle's
the resort manager here.
He's Trent. I'm Maddox.
I can do a 1,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle,
which is a considerable
thing to do.
My dad and I put
clear glue on them
and hang them on my wall.
I collect conch shells.
I have 42 conch shells.
Amazing.
- Okay.
- I might need a little help with this.
Right, so you do
strawberry and vanilla?
Hi.
Thank you.
Yes. Ah, okay.
Okay, I got it.
Okay. Come on.
Thank you.
Great job helping.
Yes.
You!
I touched your jacket.
That counts.
Hey.
There's 250,000
furniture-related injuries
in the United States per year.
25% of those...
coffee table injuries.
Hey. Hey!
- Fine.
- Okay.
Warren and Warren must be
affiliated with this resort.
They must have conventions here.
We love this
pharmaceutical company at work.
We're considering
asking our clients
to use Warren and Warren drugs
as a way to lower
their insurance rates.
Ah, hmm. Yeah.
"No kids allowed on the beach"?
What? Hold on.
"No Kids Week"?
- That's not true!
- It says no ki...
- Let me see that!
- Prisca, you should've checked.
- Let me see that!
- It's your mom's fault.
- Let me see!
- No, no, no, really.
- No, it says this. No.
- Oh, my God, let me see.
- She should've checked. It says this.
- Let me see!
- Yes, of course.
- Let me see!
I know this is
very painful news
- for you all to bear, but now...
- Let me see!
- ...now I've gotten power.
- No!
Yes. And you have to do it.
Yes, you have to understand.
It's like this.
Life is like this.
It's tough, and sometimes things
don't go the way you want.
Oh, my gosh.
Come on. Blue team's winning.
Ah, good hit.
What's your name, and what
do you do for a living?
Hey, guys. I'm Annette.
And what's your name?
I'm Trent. This is Idlib.
Hey, nice to meet you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Hi. I'm Trent. This is Idlib.
What are your names, and what
do you do for a living?
Oh, well, I'm Sophia Watson.
I'm a chef.
I'm Greg Mitchell. I'm a cop.
Cool.
And I'm Malin Mitchell.
I'm a dancer.
Wow. That's cool.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, let's go over there.
Truth-telling game. Go.
I can't do a push-up. Go.
I don't have friends.
I'm your friend.
You'll leave.
My mom might let me
FaceTime you.
Then we can be friends.
You can come over to my house
and make up stories.
Then we can go
to the same college together
and become neighbors
with mortgages.
Cool.
It's weird.
I know.
It's hanging over me.
I can barely eat.
And I don't feel anything?
We agreed... we'd give them
one last vacation
before telling them.
I can't understand why
we don't take
into consideration...
That shouldn't affect anything.
The doctor said
it's a nonfactor.
It's probably been there
for years, he said.
We were on a course to separate.
That's confusing enough for us.
Let's not bring an irrelevant
medical condition into this.
Let's get through this, Guy.
Compartmentalize.
It's only for three days.
You found a place?
Yes.
Oh, Prisca, come on.
You're always thinking
about the future!
It makes me feel not seen!
You're always thinking
about the past.
You work in a goddamn museum!
I think they stopped.
Why don't you play?
Good morning.
What would you like
for breakfast?
I'll have
the Calcium Bomb juice drink.
I have a calcium deficiency.
So, is it really calcium-rich
or just a catchy name?
It has all
calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.
Sit up, Kara, honey.
- Okay.
- All right?
You don't want to be hunched
when you grow up, baby.
It's very unattractive.
Boys will get turned off.
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.
This one.
I recommend
the granola parfait.
Um, it's a good choice.
Okay.
So, how is the Capa family?
Any plans today?
Well, one of our kids
wants to do Jet Ski,
- and the other one...
- Mm-hmm.
...wants to do
anything but that.
Well, there's, um...
there's a private beach
on the nature preserve side
of the island.
It's impossible to find.
It's surrounded
by stunning rocks,
- very unusual minerals.
- Oh.
Oh, it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, so...
A natural anomaly.
I only recommend it
to certain guests.
But I liked you guys
immediately.
All right? You're a nice family.
So I-I could arrange
a van to take you, if...
Hmm. Yeah.
Sounds like
a great memory for us.
It's our little secret.
I'll make all the arrangements.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Okay, so I think we should get
the Calloway Kale-away
for Trent.
Idlib, what did I tell you
about being in here
when you shouldn't?
You can't... You know,
I told you so many times.
You know, we have certain...
I'm a doctor.
My wife has epilepsy.
I'm a nurse.
My name is Jarin.
Right, she's having
a grand mal seizure.
Keep things away
from her, please.
Patricia?
Doll?
All right, Jack,
I think if you just leave her
lying here for a while,
put something under her head,
I think she'll be fine.
Thank you, Doctor.
It's Jarin, by the way.
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.
I'm sorry I ruined
everyone's breakfast.
You always want to be
the center of attention.
My goodness.
Let's get you
something to drink?
Yeah.
Idlib?
Oh, can't be
that secret of a beach.
We were told to keep it quiet.
- So were we.
- Sit down, Gustav.
Good boy.
Come. Stay.
Okay, guest checklist.
Books, sunscreen.
Did everybody leave
their passports in their safes?
I don't want anybody
to lose anything.
Yeah.
What are your names
and occupations?
Okay, my friends.
You can just call us,
and we'll pick you up
whenever you're ready
to come back.
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 p.m.
Just follow the path
down to the beach.
- Is that also food?
- Yeah.
Wow. That's a lot of food.
Well, kids eat a lot of food.
And you got
three of them with you.
Okay.
Seems like a waste,
but thank you.
Could you help us carry
some of these bags, please?
We've got an elderly person
here and a child.
I'm sorry. I got to get back.
But it's not far.
Just walk down.
You'll see a beautiful
slot canyon.
Walk through that, and in
a few minutes, you'll be there.
Enjoy, everybody.
- Do you think there's...
- Come on.
Do you think there's snakes?
Of course.
Cool. I want to see one.
- Gorgeous.
- Wow.
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah?
Could, uh,
someone please tell me
what just happened?
Look out.
Oh, this is so exciting.
Careful, Maddox.
- Let's go!
- I'm gonna win.
Wow.
I just got chills.
Come on, darling.
Let's show Gustav the sea.
Hey. Maddox, Maddox, look.
Listen, I...
Let's move somewhere else.
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?
- No, but I...
- No, it's...
Look, it's beautiful.
Have you ever seen
anything like that?
They were right to send us.
Lie down.
Good boy.
Kids, look at
the beautiful coral.
I'm gonna get... Aah! Stop!
What are you going to do?
Now I'm gonna splash you.
Just keep on reading, I guess.
You just splashed me.
Stop!
I didn't mean to splash you.
- Guy?
- Yeah.
What book am I reading?
I don't know.
Why?
No reason.
Prisca, I wanted
to tell you something.
No, never mind.
I'll tell you later.
Oh, my God.
That's Mid-Sized Sedan.
What? Mid what?
He's a rapper.
"More Dough for the Cookin'"?
- Mid-Sized Sedan?
- Begin an activity.
- Dad, I have to. I have to!
- Yes. Okay.
You and Mom on one side.
No, no, no, no, no. Leave him.
Sounds like fun. Come on.
No, because it's, like,
a private, you know...
No, Dad, stop! I need to say hi.
He's on vacation.
He's on vacation.
What's his surname? Sedan?
Oh! Oh.
Whoa.
Whoa. All right.
Here's a big one. Aah!
Help me with this.
We should have
a housewarming party.
Isn't our house so beautiful?
- Boo!
- Aah! You!
- Come. Come back here!
- No!
Not gonna get me!
Kara, you know,
I'm gonna get you right now.
Come on.
- Not gonna get me!
- No, I am.
Come on, Kara.
Whoa! Oh, my God.
Caught you.
Ha. Never gonna catch me.
Honey, I'm home.
I told you,
I don't want to live like this.
I'm gonna live in a condominium.
I'm going for a drive
to calm down.
I'm really, really hungry.
Me, too. My stomach's growling.
Me, too.
Wow.
Who would leave this?
Hey, Mom!
From the hotel!
They're so rusted.
Put that down!
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself.
Come away.
- Next activity.
- What's happening?
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
- I don't know.
They found stuff
from the hotel in the sand.
18, 19, 20.
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!
Mom!
Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!
What is it? What is it?
- Trent?
- Someone over there.
Over where?
Come on,
give me a hand. Get the legs.
Make your list.
- Make your list.
- Okay.
- Red and orange.
- Red, orange.
Come away from here, babies.
Let the doctor try
and help this lady, yeah?
- Green.
- Green.
- Tan.
- Tan.
- Purple.
- Purple.
- What happened?
- It's okay.
- Blue.
- Blue. Blue is good.
- In there.
- Green.
- Green, yes.
- Yellow.
Yellow. I love yellow.
Call the police, right?
I'll get my mobile.
Oh, damn.
What happened to her, Mom?
I don't know.
- I'm still hungry.
- Me, too.
Was she with you?
I was waiting for her.
She swam out by herself.
Yo, I don't know
what the hell happened.
I ain't saying nothing else.
Did you strike him?
I don't need to know
the context of...
What? No. Of course not.
So why's your nose bleeding?
I told y'all, I ain't got
nothing to say to you.
My chest feels funny.
Well, you know,
we should've gotten a yacht,
like I suggested, Agnes.
You shouldn't have
fought me on that.
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.
I mean, I...
Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.
I have to take it off.
Well, just loosen your...
We're from Philadelphia.
I'm on a break here with
my wife and kids. That's them.
That... Well, yeah, over there.
And for the record, I know
most people who die on vacation
die from sun exposure,
overexertion,
overindulgence
of food or alcohol
or-or a mixture of all
of the above 99.4% of the time.
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.
I calculate people's
insurance rates
based on their risk profile.
I ain't do nothing, man.
She was into me.
Somebody will figure this out.
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.
No reception at all.
I guess our beach day's over.
You got to keep an eye
on him and the body.
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.
Did you just get
dropped off by the resort?
Yeah. We were supposed
to come earlier,
but we rested in the room first.
Great. We have to get
the resort people
before they leave.
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.
Wait. Why?
They left already.
What happened?
We really don't know
what happened.
Well, I think this man had
something to do with it.
Man, if I was involved,
why would I be
standing around, bro?
- Damn.
- His nose is bleeding.
I think he got that when she
was trying to defend herself.
I don't like
this dynamic at all.
Yo, my nose has been bleeding
for hours, man.
I don't know why
it's doing that.
Charles, something's wrong
with your mother.
She's asking for you, honey.
Well, we're all in this now.
We are responsible
for that woman.
And I've got nothing
against this man.
I'm just doing
what needs to be done.
No cell phone reception
on this beach.
You stay here.
I'll go to the clearing
in the jungle
where they dropped us
and try to call.
They obviously have
a signal out here.
- How else do people call to go back?
- Right.
Oh, my God.
You stumbled back out.
You were holding your head.
You looked like
you were in pain, babe.
You blacked out.
I felt this pressure in my head.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, Charles.
I-I think it's the shock.
Try to help Gustav,
or he'll be sick.
Yeah, of course it's the shock.
Listen, I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,
but first, I've got to deal
with all this, all right?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I know you've been stressed.
Don't let this upset you.
Help these people
through this, Charles.
So, what did you hear?
Help these people through
this, Charles.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. I saw you were
talking to my husband.
I know you're dealing with a
lot with that woman right now,
but something is wrong
with my son.
- Some kind of reaction.
- Is... is it severe?
I don't have time for this.
What kind of doctor are you?
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.
You don't know me.
I curate exhibits for museums.
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me
and not think I'm being
hysterical when I say
there's something very wrong
with my child.
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.
You look different, too.
How?
Uh, I don't know.
You just look different.
Hold my hand.
Okay.
Willow.
Japanese maple. Evergreen.
If you get scared,
just tell me, okay?
What do you keep looking at?
- There.
- Where?
Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.
What do you see?
I thought I saw
something shiny.
Here comes Mom.
Charles, she stopped breathing!
She stopped breathing!
I didn't do anything, Charles.
You guys just...
you just walked away,
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.
She... I mean, she was peaceful.
Can you step back, please?
We'll take the kids
away from here.
Is this happening?
She couldn't take the shock.
She-she saw a murdered woman,
and her heart couldn't take it.
What are your names
and occupations?
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.
I'm Patricia.
I'm a psychologist.
He remembers everyone's names
and things about them.
Everything's gonna be okay.
What's your name?
I'm Trent.
This is my sister Maddox.
How old are you guys?
I'll guess. I'm good at this.
You're 11, right, Trent?
I'm six.
No.
Really, are you ten, 11?
He's not lying. He's six.
I'm specifically
six and a quarter.
She's 11.
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.
They're playing with us.
Let's leave it.
Okay, what's
your best friend's name?
Maddox.
How sweet.
Have you seen my children?
Is-is everyone trying
to play a joke on us?
- What?
- Aren't these your children?
I'm right here, Mom.
Mom?
Mom.
Why are you looking
at me like that?
Prisca.
I think we should leave.
Get the kids back to the resort.
Guy.
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.
What's going on?
You see? You see?
Damn.
- How'd we get here?
- Take it easy.
Intense cranial pressure.
It's like being deep underwater.
Hey, can you get up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy.
Charles?
- Yeah, no, I'm-I'm all right.
- You okay?
I'm fine. I'm all good.
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.
For some reason, people are
blacking out going this way.
Three people
have blacked out now.
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, no, no.
I saw it, Prisca.
I saw Jarin black out.
What I know is that we have to
get these kids to a hospital.
Now.
Look, let's stop
talking about it.
The kids are scared.
I can stay here with them,
but everyone else should try
and find a different pathway
off this beach.
Break off into groups of two
in case people black out.
Chrystal, go with me.
Whoa.
Whatever you do,
just stay close.
- I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
- Just... Hmm?
Don't get up too quickly.
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk
for a second.
No. Mom, we're scared.
Please, stay right here.
Okay?
If I cry,
please don't let them see.
I won't.
Your hands are shaking.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they are.
- Yeah. You okay?
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.
That is just
statistically impossible.
All three kids are reacting
to something.
Only the kids.
I mean, look at
the doctor's daughter.
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.
Or they caught something.
We're on a remote,
undeveloped island,
but we have a doctor here, so...
let's get the doc
to look at the kids.
I still can't get any reception.
Doctor, before we do
anything else,
can you take a look
at our children, please?
He's got a knife!
There's a damn hole in my cheek.
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Put that down right now, Doctor.
Watch out, Jarin.
Listen, I don't know
why I did that.
I thought he was
gonna hurt me. Sorry.
Sorry.
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?
- Okay.
- Let me see that laceration.
- Man, that's assault, man!
- Just-just...
- Calm down.
What's your name?
Mid-Sized Sedan.
I must be in shock. I'm numb.
I'm not feeling
the pain no more.
Please, let me see.
No, this is not making
any sense, Prisca.
I need to get
my ass to a hospital now.
What's with all y'all faces?
It's hard to explain.
This is messed-up, man.
Where'd it go?
This is some kind
of parlor trick.
Yo, I know I tried to dip,
but I am freaked, man.
I just want to go back
to my hotel room.
This was supposed to be
a zen trip, man.
She and I only started talking
because she was sick
and so am I.
She had just been
diagnosed with MS,
so we started rapping
about that.
I didn't do nothing
to that girl, man.
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,
backstroking and whatnot.
She swam way the hell out.
What did you say?
No, I-I-I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.
I don't watch
the Summer Olympics like that.
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,
- and so did she?
- Yes.
I thought that was
a cool coincidence.
Maybe this is some kind
of group psychosis.
I've studied this.
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.
We don't believe
we can leave this beach.
Mom, is there any more food?
I'm still hungry.
Well, she's definitely aged.
Honey, how can you
still be hungry? We just...
I'd put her biological age
somewhere between 12 and 13,
and she turned six
two weeks ago Tuesday.
What?
We're older?
Am I okay?
I don't know what's happening
to the three of you, sweetheart.
For now, I have
another swimsuit in my bag,
and maybe you should
change into that.
Uh, it might be a virus, maybe.
Could be mosquitoes where...
the way they behave
on this part of the island.
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.
- The dog has died!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
He was only just alive.
Kara, hold on to me, baby.
What's happening?
Who thinks they can swim
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents
and then turn and swim
an unknown amount
along the coast
till we find another shore?
That's what I'm guessing
the distance is
to swim out
and get around this cove.
It looks too far, babe.
It's not safe.
My name is Brendon.
I went to private school,
my mom is an attorney,
and my dad is a dentist.
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.
I have a problem with my blood.
A rare issue with its clotting.
I came to this island
to see the ocean
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.
That's beautiful, Brendon.
I don't feel the same way
I felt yesterday
or this morning,
and I don't think
my parents would understand.
My thoughts have
more colors in them now.
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,
and now I have more
and they're quieter.
Okay!
Everyone, gather!
Come on, come on, come on.
Everyone needs to have
a voice here.
Are you sure
we have time for this?
We will make
destructive decisions
if we don't feel safe
with each other.
I know we don't have time,
but...
why don't we start with you two?
Why are you here?
We've been having
a tough time...
Chrystal.
W-We've been going
through something.
He's under a lot of stress
as a doctor.
- He needed some time away.
- Everyone does.
- I'm not unusual in that.
- Charles, it's okay.
I'm not gonna say anything else.
Good!
It's nice to hear from you both.
How about you guys?
Prisca?
It's nothing.
We just have to make a decision.
The kids are reacting
to something.
It's a virus.
It's-it's probably a virus.
I just need to catch my breath.
I just started feeling weird
a minute ago.
Are you okay, Mom?
- Mom?
- What's wrong?
- Um...
- Are you okay, Mom?
I don't think it's the...
- She has a tumor.
- What?
But it's benign. It...
They said it's benign.
- Oh, my God.
- Mom...
- Wow. Um...
- Is it... Where?
Mom?
It's okay.
Can I...
I can feel it.
It's the size of a golf ball.
No, it's supposed
to be three centimeters.
All right. Let-let me see.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Mom!
- Prisca.
- She's gonna faint.
- She's gonna faint.
- Wait. - Prisca. - Mom. Mom!
Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.
It's there.
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.
Jesus.
- It's grown.
- What?
- What's happening to Mom?
- It's okay.
- Trent, it's okay. It's okay.
- Dad.
- What's happening to Mom?
- Trent, why don't you two guys
go play somewhere else
on the beach, okay?
Okay?
Mom's just a little bit tired.
Would you do that for me, tiger?
The first adult's
being affected.
Okay, what if we cut it out?
- Dad!
- Not possible.
Actually, it is.
- But it's Guy's call.
- No!
No, no, no. No.
I don't want to make
this decision. No.
No, I...
I don't know what to do.
- Do we have alcohol?
- Yes.
Some bottles from the minibar.
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand that, right?
Yes.
Okay. Well, I mean, does anyone
have a needle and thread?
We're gonna have to sew this up.
Um, yeah, yeah. Uh...
Here. Here.
Is this the right decision?
Maybe we should all
talk about this.
I can't think.
This tumor is going to kill her.
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?
Oh, no.
What is he saying?
Wh-What was the name
of that film?
- Charles, breathe.
- Are you okay?
Yes.
Will you just let me
do my job, please?
Is he okay?
Cut her again.
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.
Guy, I can help, brother.
No. No, I'll take care of her.
Does anyone know
the name of that film?
It was with Jack Nicholson...
and Marlon Brando.
Both!
Try again, Doctor.
Oblique incision
on the side of the belly.
Four to six inches.
You can do this.
Put your fingers
inside the incision.
Okay.
Can you open it
a little wider, please?
It's closing around my fingers.
Keep pulling it apart.
That's it.
I'm lifting the tumor out.
Wow!
It's the size of a cantaloupe.
W-Wait.
It's attached to something.
Muscle tissue.
Okay. You, um,
hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would.
I'm so sorry, Pris.
Just cutting
underneath the tumor.
Okay. Got it.
Mom.
Prisca?
Mom?
It's okay.
I just fainted.
We took the tumor out.
It was going to kill you.
Your husband made
a fast decision.
Guy, I feel better.
Damn.
Come on, y'all, look at this!
Hurry!
Damn.
Come on, y'all.
Can we all agree
I didn't do that?
What happened to her?
The body has decomposed.
- How quickly can that happen?
- A long time.
Mom knows this stuff.
I'm not a forensic pathologist,
but from excavations
for the museum,
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.
My best guess... an exposed body,
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.
And this happened in what,
three hours?
I know.
And bones, we found,
will disintegrate
in 30 years more.
The hell, man?
On this beach, less than
20 hours after you die,
you just return to dust.
What exactly are we saying?
Something is going on
with time on this beach.
Time?
You have wrinkles.
I'm scared.
It's best to focus
on specifics in the present
in unsettling situations.
Mm-hmm.
Like breathing.
What's happening to us?
Are we sick, too?
No, I don't think so.
I think we're just growing.
Going by
Trent and Maddox's ages
and the time we spent
on this beach,
half an hour is equivalent
to something like one year
of our lives.
This must be true for all of us.
We just don't see it
on everyone.
You know, it's the first time
- they wished they were Black.
- Mm-hmm.
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.
They need to grow an enormous
amount of mass quickly.
We're staying roughly
the same mass.
Our cells are just aging.
I don't feel the same.
It's like my mind
is changing, too.
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.
It's weird.
I'm not as scared about
what's happening to us.
What about our hair and nails?
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?
Maybe it has to do
with the fact that the cells
in hair and nails are dead
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.
On this beach,
60 minutes is two years.
We'll age almost 50 years
in one day here.
Almost a lifetime.
I think it could be the
rock that surrounds this beach.
If our cells are being affected,
speeding up in their processes,
then us trying to leave is like
swimming to the surface too fast
after being deep in the ocean.
Our bodies can't reacclimate.
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.
Maybe...
we could slowly walk
through the canyon.
Take a step, stand still.
Do it over eight to ten hours.
Let our bodies acclimate.
But according to
Prisca's timeline,
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.
Let's not shut down
everyone's experience.
Wait. Where are the kids?
Trent!
Kara!
Answer us now!
We need you here!
There they are.
- Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.
Hey.
Mom! Dad!
Kara?
What did you do?
We were just playing. It's okay.
I just got a little fat.
Mom, you're better.
Maddox?
Maddox.
It's okay, Trent.
Just let Mom and Dad
figure this out.
My God, Guy.
It's okay, right, Mom?
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
were in a movie together.
If she walked into
the emergency room,
I'd say she's about
five months pregnant.
- What?
- What?
Just stay calm, Trent.
She'll only be pregnant
for about 20 minutes
from the time of conception.
Why do you keep looking at me
like you want
to steal my wallet?
Do you want me
to punch you in the face?
Calm down.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
All right.
Let's just concentrate
on the issue at hand.
Do you know about movies?
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.
Okay, we need to get her help.
Okay? This cannot happen here.
- It's gotten bigger.
- Kara.
- It's Kara, right?
- Yeah.
- Lay down on a blanket.
- It's gonna be okay.
There's a lot of people here
that can help you.
We're all like your family now.
Oh, God.
Our cells are aging
very fast here.
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.
Just lay down
on the sand. Okay.
Whatever would have
happened to us
is happening to us really fast.
Okay.
What you did is
how babies are made.
I know, but I thought
you had to do that
ten times or something.
Did I get that wrong?
Look, it can happen
after only once.
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.
Are Trent and I having a baby?
Did I get it wrong?
Only a couple
of minutes left if we're right.
- Is that the baby?
- You got it. Okay.
- Mom.
- Charles!
- Kara?
- I...
I need to think about
what to do.
- Mom, I think I...
- No. I need to help her.
Mom!
- I'm scared!
- It's okay.
- Kara. - Wait.
- Mom, it's coming.
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Come on, baby.
- Can you hold her hand? Kara?
- I've decided...
I'm gonna marry her, and we are
never gonna yell at each other,
and we are never
getting divorced!
Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain.
Intense pain. Okay?
Like she never felt before.
But then it's going to pass.
Okay? It's going to pass.
Chrystal.
Chrystal!
Hey, you blacked out.
You can't go that way.
Come on. You're okay now.
Come on.
Get up.
Come here.
Look.
You're okay. Come on. Come on.
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- It's here.
We looked that up,
remember, Mom?
We put him
on the towel to clean him up.
He looked around
and closed his eyes.
We had him on the towel
for one minute.
He died from lack of attention.
Things are moving too fast here
for a baby to survive.
No. No, you're lying.
You're lying! You're all lying!
- Trent. Shut up, Trent!
- You're lying! You're lying!
- You're lying!
- Hey, hey, hey.
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.
Charles.
- Get us out of here!
- It's my baby.
Get us out of here now!
You were supposed to protect us!
You didn't protect us!
Kara's hurt!
I will make these decisions.
Just give me a second.
I used to see you
in our neighborhood.
Who... who are you?
I'm Jarin!
I-I don't know where you live.
Don't condescend to me.
Put some makeup on your face.
I'm sorry about the baby.
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.
His name was Giuseppe.
He wasn't very handsome,
and I left him.
We looked silly together,
he and I.
He had nothing to offer.
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.
Leave me alone.
Charles, stop!
Stop! Stop!
He's gone.
Oh, God.
Bring your bag.
Okay, come here.
I'm just going to take it...
- ...now.
- It's okay.
Everything will be okay.
I'll find another beach,
and I'll try to find help.
She needs her medicine.
We're lucky she hasn't
had a seizure yet.
It must be the beach,
whatever it's doing to my body.
Guy, I was on the swim team.
I'll make it.
I'll make it.
Watch him.
Maybe I could climb that rock.
Maybe the effect,
the blacking out,
doesn't happen if you go up.
You can't do it.
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong.
- He can do it. He can do it.
- Yeah.
No. I won't allow
my son to do that.
Prisca's right.
It's too dangerous.
It's a last resort.
Mom...
I do feel overwhelmed.
I'm managing,
but no one must know.
They'll try to stop me
from working.
What should I do?
Mom, tell me what to do.
Prisca,
something's bothering me.
Charles' family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.
Someone in each group was sick.
How did you first hear
about this place?
I don't know. I-I fell upon it.
A random sweepstakes.
It came with a receipt
at the pharmacy.
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.
They know
our medical condition.
They chose us.
They have our passports.
We could just disappear.
They sent us a special car
to the airport.
- A plane.
- They can...
They can make it look like
we never left our house.
You were thinking
about leaving Dad,
weren't you?
Yes.
I didn't want you two to suffer.
Was there someone else?
Did Dad know?
Maddox.
Please.
I found out about this tumor,
and I got scared.
I stare at the remains of
nameless people in glass cases,
and I kept thinking I'm going
to be one of those people.
Does that make any sense?
I feel different
than I felt yesterday.
What I did feels like
an illusion.
I swear.
Do you hate me now?
I just need some time, Mom.
We don't have that, baby.
Look at you.
You're an adult.
Be strong for everyone.
Connect to something bigger.
Here, here. Dad.
Lay him down. Lay him down.
He must have gone
unconscious swimming.
Brendon didn't do anything
to that woman.
We can't swim out, Prisca.
We're not getting
off this beach.
We never had a prom.
Or a graduation.
There are so many memories
we didn't have.
It's not fair.
He needs to rest now.
Kara.
Kara.
Wait. What if you get
dizzy up there?
- You might black out.
- Trent, we are in charge now.
My dad could hurt more people.
I have to get him
off this beach.
Kara! Don't climb that.
Come down!
We'll find another way.
- No, don't! Trent.
- Listen to Mom.
I have to go with her!
Kara, wait! Don't climb!
Let me get your mother!
- Kara!
- It's not the way.
She's panicked and desperate.
Talk to each other.
Kara, you and I
should just stay together.
What if we spend
this whole time trying
to get out of here
and we still don't make it?
It'll be too short
if we don't try.
No, Kara, please!
Please just stay with me,
please.
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.
Go to the ledge and rest!
There has to be a way out.
It's a mathematical certainty
there must be a way out.
No. Why is she stopping?
No.
No. Kara! Kara, wake up!
Kara, wake up!
Wake up!
Kara.
Daddy.
Let's all stay together.
Nobody in this family
goes alone anywhere.
I think I figured it out.
I'm using these to swim out.
I have a sister.
She's a therapist, too.
I need to get to my sister.
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.
She's older, but now I am.
The fighting seems
ridiculous now.
Patricia.
Patricia.
No.
Wh-What's happening to her?
What's going on?
She was fine.
What-what's happening?
She keeps
stopping and starting.
No. Dad, do something.
Oh, no.
Kara?
Kara, where are you?
Somebody's done this
to us, Kara.
I can't protect you anymore.
Kara!
No, you don't know.
Jarin went in a different way.
He went on, and I... and I'm
a better swimmer than he is.
He's older than me.
I-I can probably swim...
Trent, stop it. No. No.
No, you're not
a better swimmer than him.
Yeah, but let me try.
Listen. Listen.
We're not gonna let you.
Stop. It won't work.
Well, I don't want to give up.
- I really don't want to give up.
- We're not giving up.
And I think,
if you let me try...
My back.
I need my calcium.
Chrystal?
Chrystal, stay with us.
Don't look at me.
Prisca, I have to
tell you something.
I saw your text messages
one day.
He says romantic things.
I'm sorry.
I don't know who I would have
been okay with, but...
with that guy?
He's-he's a joke.
He's a pretend person.
You deserve someone
so much better than that.
I should have said something
when I saw it.
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.
This was no one's
responsibility but me.
Your anger should be aimed
at me, just me.
There's no place
I want to be but with you.
Do you believe me?
I want to be here...
...right now.
It's notebooks.
Well, maybe we can use
some of the empty pages
for the fire,
keep Mom and Dad warm.
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science fiction writer.
It's full of story ideas.
"Birds that can make you
black out when they scream
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."
He realized he was never
getting off this beach.
He's trying to figure out
what's going on.
"Magnetism of this exact spot
on the Earth
"with the rocks on this beach
submerged beneath the ocean
"for millions of years
deposited with special minerals
"are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.
"Are there other places
like this?
Who found this place?"
Well, maybe we can make
a metal tube that we can get in
that stops the effects
on our cells.
Like at a dentist's office,
you know,
when they put a metal vest
on us before an X-ray.
I mean, then we could just
walk out with it on us and...
I mean,
we'll get dizzy at first,
but then, slowly,
we'll get used to it
and we can leave, right?
Where are we gonna make
a metal tube?
He wrote down a list of all
the names and the addresses
of the people with him
on the beach.
Maddox, that's a camera.
They're recording us.
Why would they do this?
Who is that?
Prisca, who is that?
You're gonna tell them
what I did.
The man with the tattoos,
he was gonna steal things
from my home.
Guy!
No!
I can't let you tell them.
I'm a good doctor.
He was gonna follow us.
He was gonna steal things
from our home.
Why don't you believe me?
I stopped him.
Tell me where
the knife is, Prisca!
I keep having these thoughts.
Listen, they keep coming to me.
Don't tell anyone.
Prisca!
Hide the kids! I'll protect you!
Yes.
Maddox! Trent!
I need you two to go
and find somewhere to hide now!
Somewhere where
someone can't find you.
- I need you to go right now.
- Mom, what...
And don't ask any questions.
Now, go! Hide!
Go!
Shh.
There's someone
in here with us.
My body hurts to move.
I miss Giuseppe.
Don't look at me!
Turn off the light!
I don't want to be seen!
Kara's dead, isn't she?
Whoever did this killed her,
didn't they?
Kara died.
It was an accident.
Don't look.
God, it's already healed
in the wrong position.
Turn off the light!
Go.
Turn the light off.
I'm chief medical officer
of my hospital!
I am not gonna let...
...take it away from me!
It's rust.
It acts like poison when it
gets into your bloodstream.
I'm sorry you were
on this beach.
But this is my family.
Dad, Mom, you guys
got to stay hydrated.
Mom.
Mom.
Are you warm enough?

♪ His violent departure ♪

Were we fighting
about something?
We were.
Well, whatever it was, uh,
I'm not mad anymore.
I can't remember.
Why did we want
to leave this beach?
So beautiful.
It doesn't matter.
It's funny.
I...
forget...
the word.
It's about my feelings for you.
I know.
- Dad.
- Dad?
Mom?
Oh, Mom.
We have about...
13 hours left, do you think?
We just got three days older
while you held my face.
Should we keep trying
to get out?
I guess so.
Want to make a sandcastle first?
I wonder if everybody
continues to feel like a kid
when they're our age, or...
is it because
we were kids yesterday?
Idlib sent me
a message I never decoded.
Yeah, we thought
we were so smart.
Decode it.
Each symbol means a letter.
We thought we were like spies.
What was the big message?
What's it say?
The coral might protect us
from the effects of the rocks.
Maybe that's like
our metal tube.
Maybe we're just making up
what we want to hear.
Well, maybe he heard
they took people to this beach.
Idlib heard something
he shouldn't have.
He has no idea what it means,
but he knows it's bad.
He's trying to help us.
Wait.
I need to get something.
Both of them drowned.
For a second,
I thought they were
gonna get through the coral.
I don't know how they suddenly
thought about going there.
Theo, are you sure
they didn't make it?
We can't have another incident.
Sidney, relax. I watched
for a minute and a half.
And the one person
who got through last year
ended up drowning anyway.
We're fine.
Final members of trial 73
are deceased.
Observation's complete.
Bringing drives back,
returning to base.
All rooms for
this trial have been cleared.
Uh, home computer devices
have been wiped.
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.
Hello.
Uh, a moment of silence
for the members of trial 73.
Thank you.
Mm.
I'll try not
to be dramatic. Uh...
Because of this beach,
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives
with new medicines.
Before we're done,
it will be millions.
As you know,
we do trials
and fail constantly.
But not today.
Tell them, Sidney.
One of this cohort, uh,
was a woman with
the epileptic seizures.
Her name was
Patricia Carmichael.
She suffered debilitating
seizures her whole life.
Nothing could help her.
The medicine we gave her
when she arrived
turned out to be
the exact mixture.
She didn't have a seizure
for eight hours and 17 minutes.
16 and a half years.
We cured her of her epilepsy.
We'll now fast-track trials,
make that medicine
and share it
with the whole world.
Every single person
that needs it.
Nature made that beach exist
for a reason.
Warren and Warren was
meant to find it
on their research expedition.
We were meant to test
medicines in one day
instead of a lifetime.
Lots more work to be done,
everyone.
Let's do what nature
wanted us to do.
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive
at 11:00 a.m.
with six nontargeted guests.
Joseph Brody has
early-onset Parkinson's.
Florence Brody will be
accompanying him.
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, Nills.
We should separate
the pure medical subjects
from the mental illness
subjects.
Our violent
schizophrenic patient
cost us the data
on our blood clot patient.
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter
protocol at this point,
but, uh, put it in a form
and submit it
to Warren and Warren again.
How are you?
Those kids went home.
They don't matter.
I tell you which kids
you can play with.
You have to trust me.
And don't ask question.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Good.
Now, those kids are fine.
See, you can play with them.
Okay.
Good.
You're a police officer.
Yeah.
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.
Welcome to our version
of paradise.
Thank you.
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Thank you.
This is Madrid.
From your food and beverage
preferences that you selected,
we've made you cocktails
to welcome you.
Sorry.
Oh, no worries,
Mr. and Mrs. Brody.
We'll just make a new set.
It'll only take a few moments.
I wouldn't take
anything they give you.
They left us all to die.
My name is Trent Capa.
I'm Maddox Capa.
All three are missing persons?
Sending you the rest
of the names now.
Our parents are
Guy and Prisca Capa.
We live at 707 Pine Street,
Philadelphia, USA.
Also with us was
Jarin Carmichael,
who was a nurse;
Patricia Carmichael,
who was a psychologist...
Listen, we have to get security.
What's happening?
Are you listening to me?
May I help you?
Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Gentlemen, we have a problem.
I need your assistance
immediately.
Two of our guests need
your attention.
Solve this problem. Now.
We've arrested everybody here.
Subpoenas are being served
at Warren and Warren's
headquarters this week.
Let's get them to the airport.
Your aunt will be waiting
for you when you land.
How's she handling things?
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called
and told you he was
your six-year-old nephew?
We'll be okay.
