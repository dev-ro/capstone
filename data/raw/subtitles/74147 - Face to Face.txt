Hi, grandma. It's Jenny.
How are you?
The weather's so beautiful.
Yes, they just took the last of the furniture.
It looks so empty.
No, dinner's impossible.
I must be at the clinic first.
Yes, I'll be there at eight.
Give grandpa my love.
I think you'd feel a lot better
if you got up and washed and dressed.
In any case we should open the curtains.
It's quite warm in here.
Last time I saw you we had a good talk.
What's happened now?
You know that I know
you're putting on an act.
What good is that?
Forehead...
Cheek...
Eye...
Mouth...
You mustn't.
Poor Jenny.
Poor Jenny.
Poor Jenny...
- Jenny!
- Grandma!
Come in.
- Lovely! If you knew how happy I am...
- Lovely, I know.
- Grandpa and I looked forward to this.
- Where is grandpa?
Grandpa, how are you?
Here I am and I'm staying for two months.
Eric is in Chicago at a congress.
We just talked on the telephone. He says there'll
be so much to tell you when he's home again.
Come along now and I'll show
you to your room. I'll put you
in your old room. It's quiet, you won't be disturbed
at all. There's no noise from the street in the summer.
- Oh grandma, you didn't have to...
- You know the furniture you had as a girl?
It's been brought down for you. Do you
recognize it?
And your old desk...
You must tell me if there's anything you need.
Grandpa and I have so looked
- forward to you coming.
- So have I.
We'd better go and have some tea
with grandpa.
He gets so impatient if he
has to wait.
Can you help grandpa?
And how's my little Anna?
Anna's gone off to riding camp.
She's in love
with a three year older boy, who's been
telling her all about the world revolution.
- Is he also at riding camp?
- Anna is 14 years old
- and can take care of herself.
- Sugar in your tea?
Yes, please. Three lumps.
Oh grandma, you've made scones. And
I've been considering a diet...
That's nonsense.
Well, after riding camp, Anna will
be staying with a friend.
And she won't be home until
school begins.
- And when will the new house be ready?
- In August, I hope.
The construction man has promised,
but you never know.
- And you work at the hospital all summer?
- Yes.
Does that mean you'll have
no time to rest?
Eric and I thought about going to Italy
in October, but we'll see.
- What sort of substitute is it?
- I'm filling in as senior physician.
- I hope you're well paid.
- Thank you grandma, I'm very well paid.
Are you happy at work?
I'm happy wherever I am.
- How is it?
- With me? Just fine.
- Something wrong between you and Eric?
- Not at all!
- Well, something's wrong.
- I'm just a little tired.
I haven't recovered from the flu I had in
spring. I must take vitamins.
Let's go and say goodnight to grandpa.
Grandpa loves to look at these
old pictures.
He looks at them for hours.
That could be the summer of 1948.
It must be, because Greta
has a big belly
and Ragnar was born in September.
There were so many of us.
And that damned boat that always
broke down when we needed it.
How I hated that boat.
- You were daddy's little girl.
- There were reasons for it.
Goodnight. Sleep well.
Don't look at the pictures too long
or your eyes will start to hurt.
20 years ago I realised the unfathomable
brutality in our methods
and the total meltdown of psychoanalysis.
I don't think we can cure one person.
One or two will be cured
despite our efforts.
I think you'll get to keep Maria for a
while, if you don't mind it.
You're the boss.
At least for now.
I'm going. I'm having lunch
with the interior minister,
an incurably normal neurotic.
Goodbye.
And leave Maria to me when you've had it.
Ideally before Erneman comes back from Australia.
He's understood that this is a factory where ends
must meet and likes the lunatics to be rotated.
That's why the politicians love him so much and
let him travel around the world, spreading the gospel.
By the way, are you coming
to my wife's party?
- Are you?
- No. She's revealing her new lover.
Young Mr. Strömberg.
- The actor?
- The very same.
He is exactly 26 years younger than my wife.
It's all very touching.
- I mean it, without irony.
- Isn't Strömberg...
Yes, but Elisabeth loves his friends too.
She's like a mother to them.
I think I'm going.
Tell her that my prognosis for young
Mr. Strömberg is bad and that I,
despite everything, love her.
Dear Jenny!
Are you showing up already!
- I thought it was at five?
- No, it was at two.
Almost everyone has left.
Come in. It's so good to see you!
What a nice costume you have.
Let me see... it's completely wonderful.
You are so beautiful. Ah,
to be looking like that!
How lovely to see you.
Come in.
Where's your husband? Oh, right,
he's in America.
This is Michael.
I'm very much in love with him.
Actually.
He's so good to me.
And this is his best friend,
Ludvig.
We're going to Bahamas, the
three of us.
And this is Tomas. I'm sure you've
heard about him.
He travels to developing countries,
teaching girls to use contraceptives.
And he's the cutest doctor in the world
if you have heart problems,
if you know what I mean...
And this...
Who is this? Michael, do you
remember who this is?
Let's not bother him. He's taken
a little nap and he deserves it
after telling us all off a
while ago. My, what a
speech that was. And this is
a pair of sweet girls.
And capable.
They've opened a little store at the corner.
I think we should offer the
boys some strawberries.
Aren't they fantastic, with
their transparent dresses.
Imagine us in those clothes...
Imagine that.
Are you happy now?
I'm only telling this to you,
because you understand.
- Of course there are problems.
- Really?
- Cheers!
- Cheers.
Michael is very complicated. I almost
get scared of him sometimes.
And Ludvig is a bad seed.
But generally, you could say that
I am somewhat happy.
Are you alright, Elisabeth?
I'm grateful.
Humbly grateful. Not only because
of Michael.
But because I have
myself safe and sound.
And because I know that it's my feelings.
There is no distance between...
Never mind, I'm drivelling.
I almost envy you.
We have to leave.
We're going to the countryside.
Sorry that you have to go now, but
thank you for coming.
Oh, it was lovely.
- How are you?
- Fine, how are you?
Always fine.
- What do we talk about now?
- We have an...
Sorry.
-... an excellent topic.
- Really?
- A patient who happens to be my half-sister.
- Oh, Maria.
Exactly.
It feels inappropriate to talk about a
patient in this environment.
- It's not necessary.
- How do you mean?
We could have dinner together.
There's a great fish restaurant
nearby.
- I...
- Of course. We can do it another time.
I'm in town until the end of August.
Shouldn't we go to the restaurant?
I'm just going to make a call.
If the offer stands, of course.
Hi, Martin. Thank God I got ahold
of you. I can't see you tonight.
What? Yes, a patient.
Have I met someone who is funnier?
You're so silly.
There's no point in having jealousy
between us.
Goodbye.
Oh, lord!
Shall we, or do you cling to
your impulse of escaping?
- They serve an excellent sole.
- I'm quite hungry.
Let's eat then, and see what happens
next. Is that fine?
The house is crumbling.
Sometimes I consider getting
something more modern.
When there was a woman in the house,
the garden was nice but now it's...
- What would you like to drink?
- I'm fine.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- I'm fine. As always, I must say.
- Congratulations.
- Coffee?
- Maybe later. Do you play?
- No, my wife did.
- Is she dead?
- We divorced a couple of years ago.
- Was it as successful as everything else?
The divorce was the most successful
thing we did.
- Imagine that my husband is gone for three months.
- I know, you hinted at it during dinner.
- I actually miss him.
- Of course.
I've got myself a lover who isn't half
as nice. Can you understand that?
Sort of. What other cures do you
have for your anxiety?
We're moving to a new house
this autumn.
- How nice.
- Are you bored?
Not at all. I'm just wondering if your
breasts aren't tremendously beautiful.
To still your curiosity, I can tell
you that they are very beautiful.
- You'll have to do with that explanation.
- You misread me, but that's fine.
- A cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
Wise.
Anyway, I'm going home.
Will you call for a taxi?
Wait a moment.
- I'm very tired.
- Just listen for a moment.
Go on.
Can't we be friends?
Don't look so ironic, I mean it.
Are you listening?
Sure.
I just want to know how you've imagined
us getting from here to your bedroom.
How you've figured out overwinning
the awkwardness of getting undressed.
What amazing techniques you'll use to
satisfy me, and yourself.
What demands you place
on my performance.
How advanced and impulsive you
allow me to be.
- You're very funny.
- Too bad, because I'm serious.
I also want to know how you've envisioned
the termination of the sex.
Tenderly and quietly?
A cigarette glowing in the morning light?
Nervous talk about the next time and
exchanging of phone numbers?
- I can at least drive you home.
- No thanks. I'll take a taxi.
A taxi for Söderhamnsvägen 9, please.
Thank you.
Goodbye then, Jenny.
Thank you for a pleasant afternoon.
Hope we'll meet again.
- Maybe we could go to the movies.
- Or a concert.
That would be nice.
- I'll call you.
- Maybe I'll call you.
- That would surprise me.
- Maybe I'll call just because of that.
- It's so light.
- It's almost two o'clock.
- Are you running around again?
- The clock.
- We wound it up properly last night.
- It stops.
- It doesn't.
- It's lagging.
It's just like all the other
clocks.
But if you keep fooling with it, I'm
sure it will break.
I'm not placing you in a nursing home.
It's all in your head, do you hear me?
Old age is hell.
There, there. You always have me.
I'm always by your side.
- Don't be so nervous.
- I'm sorry.
Come and lie in my bed.
Then you'll sleep better and
feel calm.
Then I'll just snore.
I've already slept enough.
Come now.
We'll have it comfortable.
- Where are my slippers?
- What slippers?
- The other ones.
- They're in the closet.
- No, I looked there.
- Yes, my dear, I put them there.
You never find anything.
- Don't be so stubborn. They're not there.
- I know that they are there.
Who is it?
Who are you calling?
I must get Maria to the hospital.
- Is it such a hurry?
- She's unconscious.
Are you sure that we drugged her?
- In any case she must get to the hospital.
- Wait a minute.
No need for an ambulance.
Don't be afraid. I won't do anything.
I have a proposition: you get out of here
immediately, then I'll take Maria with me.
- Listen to me.
- I'm not interested.
Whether you want to know or not, the
situation is this:
Maria called us yesterday and wanted to go
out, so we picked her up.
At night she got ill and started yelling
for you and that we must take her to you.
We looked you up in the phone book and
drove her here.
Nobody opened, so we crawled in through
the cellar window.
When we saw it was all empty, we called
the hospital and got
your current number.
She's too tight.
Some have to pay for a fuck, did
you know that?
Call the fucking ambulance.
This is Dr. Isaksson at the
psychiatric clinic.
I'd like an ambulance for Dennavägen 35.
Yes, right away.
- Let's not talk too much this evening.
- It's completely up to you.
- You don't understand.
- No, not really.
There are certain moments in life
you just have to get through.
- So?
- Certain hours, minutes.
- Is it like that now?
- Maybe.
- Anyway, I am grateful that we're together.
- You need a drink.
- Our last time was ridiculous. Don't you think?
- I never think it's ridiculous.
- Do you have sleeping pills?
- Of course. Want one?
Most of all I'd like you to give me
a double dose of those sleeping pills.
- Maybe I'll sleep twice as well.
- And then?
Then I'd like to sleep here in your bed,
without making love.
You'd hold my hand if needed...
Can you do that?
Don't drink if you'll take the
sleeping pills.
0,5 mg Valium and two Mogadons.
A good combination.
I use it myself without after-
effects.
Drink strong coffee in the morning.
- When do you want to be woken?
- Just before 7.
I must be at the hospital by 8:30.
- Come.
- Tomas...
If you force things to be as usual,
they'll be as usual. Don't you think?
That's how it is for me.
Something very peculiar
happened to me.
When I came to pick Maria up
the other day
there were two men in the house.
One of them tried to rape me.
At first I got scared, then I
thought it was silly.
Then...
Then?
He had his face pushed
against my breast.
He was red in the face and tried
to enter me.
And suddenly, I wanted him so badly
to make it.
Is that so strange?
No. What was strange was that even though
I wanted, he couldn't get inside me.
Everything was shut...
and dry.
I'm sorry.
I don't know...
Sit up.
Try...
- I don't understand.
- Breathe slowly. Take a deep breath.
There, there.
I don'twant to!
I want to go home. You're getting me a taxi.
I don't want you to drive me home.
There, there.
Should I call the doctor?
There are doctors here
already...
I'm just tired.
I want to go home.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I want to go home and go to bed.
How are you now?
Better.
Say what you want. I'm driving
you home.
- Sorry for being so stupid.
- You should rest.
Tomorrow I'll feel great.
Then I'm free
for two days.
Next time we'll talk only
about you.
You slept all day yesterday.
- I started to worry.
- What day is it?
It's Saturday, 9 am. I called
the hospital and told them
- that you were ill.
- God, I've slept an entire day.
I've made you some breakfast.
Thank you.
You should drink some coffee
and eat a sandwich.
Unfortunately I can't stay home with you.
Grandpa and I are invited to the Egermans.
I can't call it off.
Grandpa is so happy to go
to the countryside
- for a couple of days.
- I can take care of myself.
Are you sure?
It must be Sunday...
I should get up and eat.
It feels strange.
At least the anxiety is gone.
One thing at a time.
A bit of food.
A walk.
A book...
maybe a film.
Hi Tomas, it's Jenny.
I just wanted to apologise
for last time.
It's great.
I thought you could take me to the movies?
What do you think?
