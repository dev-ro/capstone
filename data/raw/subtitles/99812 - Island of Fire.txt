Andrew!
I missed you so much!
Hey, everyone's looking.
Let them look.
OK, let's go.
- Welcome back, Andy.
- Thanks.
To your good health, Professor.
I had you transferred from Hong Kong,
because I need your help on a case.
It might involve a high ranking
officer in the police department.
I need someone with a new face
to go undercover.
- You'll be reporting to Jerry.
- OK.
Papa, stop talking business
and start eating,
or all the food will go to waste.
All right, we'll discuss this
tomorrow. Come on now, dig in.
Yes, sir.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
He's only been home a few hours
and already you're trying
to get him drunk.
Sally cares about you.
I should be the one
proposing the toast.
I used to just hang around here
until Jerry sent me to reform school.
Then the Professor helped me and sent
me to study at the police academy.
If it wasn't for you two,
I wouldn't be here today.
To both of you. Thank you, sir.
- Shall I walk you to your car?
- No, thanks. It's just there.
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jerry.
I'll take Andy back to his hotel.
You get to bed.
Good night, Professor. I'll see you
tomorrow. I'd better get going.
You'd better get back
and get some rest. Come on.
All right.
Who's visiting the Professor
so late?
Hold it!
"Fingerprint of Suspect"
"Fingerprint Number:"
"Match Number:"
"Carl Chan,
executed January 10th, 1987."
Strange, how could our murderer
have been executed three months ago?
How could this be, Jerry?
It was a well-planned hit.
Using a supposed dead man
to commit a murder.
Either someone's been messing
with the computer,
or there's something up at the jail.
Don't dwell on it, Andy.
I'm OK. You go home if you want.
I want to be alone for a while.
OK, then.
I'll head off, then. Bye. See you.
Give me some stuff, Ronnie.
- Got the money?
- It's all gone.
That's bullshit!
Sell your body, then.
- I can't stand it!
- Get lost!
Boss, someone's looking at you.
What are you looking at?
Do you think it's worth it?
We've checked it out.
The computer is secure.
The prison is our only clue.
I've got to do it.
You might get killed.
I'll take the risk.
And what about Sally?
Don't tell her anything
until I've finished this case.
I won't. But assault
and battery is serious.
You'll be in for two years.
For your safety in prison,
no one can know who you are,
apart from you and me.
Operation - Hunter.
Take these.
I'll inform you of the rules here.
On your clothing is a number - forget
it and it's ten days in the hole.
Fighting is on Saturday afternoons.
Any unsupervised fighting -
ten days in the hole.
First bell rings at 7:55,
second bell rings at 8:00.
Never go against the officers.
Never try to escape.
No raping other inmates.
No breaking of fixtures.
Six months hard labor
for these offences.
If you smoke in bed,
it's ten days in the hole.
Every Saturday,
you'll receive one clean sheet.
Change the bottom one.
If you get it wrong -
ten days in the hole.
You'll memorize these rules. If you
forget any - ten days in the hole.
All right, this is your cell.
All right, guys. That's enough.
Now back off, all of you.
Sorry, that's my bed.
Yours is the lower one.
The last guy in that bunk
was in here for forgery.
He couldn't take it,
so he killed himself.
Hey, is this your first time in?
Don't be like that.
A guy needs a friend in this place.
Charlie.
I'm Andy.
Bed check! Hand over that cigarette!
- A whole cigarette - rich man!
- You scared me!
Who's gonna win?
- What are the odds?
- 20-1 he won't last 30 seconds.
What's going on, Charlie?
The new guy is fighting the prison
champ and the new guy is you!
And if I don't?
Everyone will be out for your blood.
Am I right, Charlie?
Yeah, that's right.
This way. Excuse me, thank you.
Hey, kid. We're all betting on you.
If you stay in for 30 seconds
we'll be rich.
Get back in there!
Get him!
There's five seconds to go!
He's still in!
Get him! Get him!
I'll get him!
It's over.
Come on.
- 20453?
- Here!
- 15783?
- Yo!
- 11795?
- Yeah!
- A letter from your son?
- His mother remarried.
She sent Joey to a boarding school.
His birthday's in two days.
But she's on her honeymoon
with her new husband.
Boarding school's not so bad -
it makes a kid more independent.
I've some fresh meat in the kitchen.
Shall I cook it for you?
It would go well with your wine.
Would you like some?
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.
Bill, open the gate.
Thanks.
Hey, cap,
are you going to be a cop forever?
Why do you ask?
Well, if you ever open a restaurant,
I'll be your cook.
What a laugh!
Who's laughing? Don't blame me
when all you have to eat is dog meat.
Hey! What's there to know?
Plenty! I'll show you.
Fry the onion.
Add the meat.
Hold this.
Hey!
You got a light?
Thanks a lot.
It's almost New Year again.
I hope I'm not working this holiday.
My wife will run off
with another man.
What's up with you?
On my salary,
I can't even afford new shoes.
Get out, come on.
I've got to check the car.
What is it, officer?
Doesn't your mother feed you?
She's thinner than I am.
What's going on?
This is all your fault.
It's mine! It's mine!
Get the ball, Joey!
- Joey.
- Papa!
Headquarters,
we've located the stolen car.
We're outside the Lawrence
boarding school. Requesting back-up.
Headquarters -
we've located the prisoner,
requesting immediate back-up.
Listen to your teachers.
I'll visit again soon.
Do you promise?
OK.
Papa loves you always.
Now go back to school.
Your teachers will miss you.
But I don't want to.
Listen to Papa.
Run inside and don't look back.
Why not?
If you do I'll turn into stone. Now
on you go or you won't see me again.
Promise you'll come visit
on New Years'?
I'll count to three and you go in.
One, two, three!
Don't move! Hands up!
Heaven's up there. I'm here.
Then come the dogs.
You're worse than a dog.
Don't go against me again.
Apologize! Go on!
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
My boss's business card.
I believe you've heard of him.
He'll give you half a million
to lose the championship tomorrow.
Be a good boy.
He could beat me...
if he's good enough.
Be a good kid and I'll guarantee you
plenty of dough.
- How was it?
- A great success.
Your shoes.
You know better
than to wear these with me.
Not bad. I've got the touch today.
Think about it.
Kiki!
I'm sorry. I ran all the way.
Don't be mad at me.
I'm so sorry, really.
- I'm sorry.
- I forgive you.
Let's grab a bite to eat.
So you think you're a big shot?
- What do you want?
- No, Kiki.
Let go of her!
Let's go.
Kiki!
Kiki!
Someone help!
Her kidney is badly damaged.
You'll need $200,000
to cover her bills.
If we don't operate now,
we may not be able to save her.
Where can I get it at this hour?
Doctor, can you do
the operation first?
I'm sorry. Hospital policy.
I can't help you.
Do what you can to raise the money.
I'm out!
What's your bet?
It's all I've got.
I call.
I see you. Full house. I win.
- See you.
- Hold it! Play a couple more.
I've got to go.
Bastard! You're a cheat!
You're a cheat!
Hey, my brother says you're a cheat.
Don't let him get away!
I need this money.
Don't make me do it.
You win.
Boss, telephone.
- Get back!
- Please cooperate. Stay back!
- Back!
- He's my brother.
- It's a police matter.
- Let me through!
- Who did it?
- He's in the car.
Boss! Boss!
- What are you doing?
- You! Get out here! I said out!
I'm going to kill you! Get out here!
Come back here! Come back here! OK.
- He killed Teddy.
- Quiet!
No matter where he goes, he's dead.
Come on!
On your clothing is a number. If you
forget it, it's ten days in the hole.
Fighting is on Saturday afternoons.
Any unsupervised fighting,
ten days in the hole.
First bell rings at 7:55,
second bell rings at 8:00.
Never go against the officers!
Never try to escape!
No raping of other inmates...
Charlie, what are the odds
for tonight?
No bet. Not tonight.
Why not?
That guy killed Boss Li's brother
Those other guys are in Li's gang.
They're in the Ghost Shadow Gang.
Word is they're going to kill
that guy Steve tonight.
Those two!
Let go of me! Let me at him!
Calm down, Steve!
- Let go!
- It's all right.
Let me go.
Let me go!
- Take him to the sickroom.
- Yes, sir.
Superintendent,
those guys were trying to kill Steve.
No way, sir. Those guys were
fighting, we tried to separate them.
Better tell the truth.
It is the truth.
He's got the knife on him.
- You're lying.
- No, he's not, Superintendent.
I can prove he's telling the truth.
Here's the knife they used.
Listen up, no screwing up
in my place.
- Take them in.
- Get going!
Write me a report.
You can come out now.
Lucas.
Don't screw up again. Going against
me is like going against God.
We respect our God.
We don't respect you.
There's no comparison.
You're back!
My brothers, never surrender!
Come in.
You asked for me, boss?
Sit down.
I hear you've been asking
about Carl Chan.
- Are you an informer?
- No.
I was looking at your hands.
You've got a well developed
trigger finger.
No one's heard of you.
So the way I see it, you're a snitch.
I'm not!
Talk! What is it with you?
In the service, I was selected
for the Olympic shooting competition.
- That's why I have strong hands.
- And Carl Chan?
We served together in the army.
He owes me some money.
You're lying.
Lucas! I won't yell out.
I won't get the guards after you.
Please, believe me.
Enough!
If you're really here to settle a
debt, Carl Chan's dead so forget it.
His slate is clean.
You watch what you're doing.
Your life is in my hands.
- Andy! Over here.
- Right.
Oh, sorry.
- Use your spoon.
- Yeah.
What's wrong with your hand?
I cut it in the shop.
Oh, yeah?
No more food till I get the truth.
Come get it
when you're ready to talk.
Thanks, Lucas, but I'm being watched.
- So you're great friends?
- No appetite.
- Bring the rice pot.
- Yes, sir.
Move!
Now let's have some fun.
You'd better eat it all,
or it's another ten days in the hole.
Lucas, save some for me.
You've all come here to work,
not to sunbathe!
I won't tolerate any goofing around.
If you're not able to complete the
road, there'll be no dinner tonight.
Officer Chang, what if we finish
early? Can we break then?
Finish early! And I'm a pig!
There's no way you'll finish early.
Now get to work!
Hey, friend, take it easy.
It's a long road.
You heard what he said. If we finish
early, he'll turn into a pig.
Hey, listen up.
If we finish early, somebody
will turn into a pig! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Come on, guys. Let's move it!
Hurry it up!
Some water, sir?
- Are they crazy?
- I don't know.
OK, let's go!
Come on, brothers! We're almost done.
Are they on drugs?
They're two hours ahead of schedule.
Anyone here see an angry pig?
Get in there, hurry up.
Hey, did you see your son?
Yeah.
He's growing up so fast,
I hardly recognized him.
I promised I'd visit him
at New Years'.
Next time don't get caught.
Every time they bring you back
and they give you another year.
At this rate, you'll never get out.
One day I'll escape for good. My son
and I will sail away on a boat.
Where will you go?
The Philippines.
Living costs are low there.
A few dollars will get you a virgin.
