"The Ria Station wishes
to inform you...
...that the ferry will depart
at 8:1 5 from pier 3"
-I've started.
-Take it easy.
I'm sweating like a pig.
Don't think about it.
Santa.
Santa!
Wait a minute.
-Your ticket.
-Wait a fucking minute.
Bastard.
You'd think it was his boat.
-Very elegant. Got an interview?
-At 1 0:00.
-You never give up.
-This looks good.
Well paid, expenses,
an office.
''Own vehicle''.
You don't have an ''own vehicle''.
I'll buy one with my first wages.
Salo is selling his.
An ''own vehicle'' that moves.
His is in the wrecker's yard.
It just says ''own vehicle''.
''Computer skills.''
My son is teaching me.
And look: ''1 1 2,000 minimum.
Plus commissions.''
''Chance of promotion.''
Santa, your ticket.
The boss'll blame me.
I said I'd give it to you.
Anyway, the service is lousy.
I'd swim across faster.
With the amount you charge,
there should be free drinks.
-And hostesses.
-Right.
Not a fish-face like you.
Pain in the ass.
The problem is
there's an age limit.
Thirty five.
What?
No?
Thirty five?
Just about.
Just about?
With that gray hair?
Look, it says it there, ''20-35''.
-And ''Presentable.''
-Aren't I presentable?
-Don't make him more nervous.
-Lino, they want fucking kids.
-Kids don't have gray hair.
-Gray hair can be presentable.
What you have to do is think
they won't give it to you.
But that's what I do think.
-Shouldn't he think positively?
-No. You know nothing about it.
-And you do.
-Anyway...
We'll see.
If I'm gray, I'm gray,
and screw the lot of them.
And what is it?
The job.
God knows.
They don't know.
Maybe. It depends.
They might call me.
So it's no.
No, it isn't no.
They might call me.
Call you to yes, or no?
If they call, it's yes.
Even if they do call,
my daughter'll be on the phone.
It happened before.
They called and it was engaged.
How long was the interview?
Five minutes.
They got rid of you.
They got rid of him, Amador.
Don't ask me.
I don't understand any of that.
You're better off that way.
Give Amador a drink.
We'll drink to
''They might call us''.
Who'll pay for it? You?
Have I ever not paid you?
Do I owe anybody anything?
-You own me 6,000.
-And me 2,000.
2,300, but I'll let you off
the 300.
Nata...
They're getting at me, Natalia.
How strange, you're so nice.
Nata is the only one
who understands me.
Why don't you and I have a drink
some day, without your father?
Maybe because I'm 1 5?
Having free drinks is one thing,
but don't mess with Nata.
Anyway, what's up?
Didn't you get enough yesterday?
She's...
She's having you on.
She's a bitch.
Don't listen to her.
Come on, what happened?
Fuck it, Jose,
don't joke about that.
You trust me, don't you?
I trust her.
Is your wife back yet, Amador?
Her mother's got worse.
Bet you're delighted.
You've been living it up.
-In here all day...
-And you weren't too far away.
Anyone seen Reina?
He said he'd invite us to the game.
He said nothing to me.
What are you doing?
It's the tip.
Yeah, but it was for me.
Give over, you're still
going to get it.
I'm reinvesting in
your business.
-Do they hurt a lot?
-The right one in particular.
From the knee down.
Did you call the doctor?
When? I didn't have time.
Tomorrow.
Tell them you have to sit down.
Yeah, I'll ask for a massage too.
Fat chance.
God, eight hours on my feet.
At night too. The bastards
keep changing our shifts.
For those shit wages.
One day, I'll tell them all
to fuck off.
The company and the boss.
He's a creep.
They can stick their fucking job
up their ass.
The cream?
It's there.
I like you, Rosa.
Monica.
Monica.
COURT OF APPEAL
Tell mom I'll call her.
I'll call her tomorrow.
You can't bring women
into your room.
She isn't a woman.
She's my sister.
You're making it worse.
It's from the court.
Have you done anything wrong?
No, but don't worry,
I'll let you know.
Australia.
Australia is fucking great.
You know how many
square kilometers it has?
Ten times this.
And the population?
No idea.
Less than half of Spain.
Just work it out.
Work out how much per head.
Here, it works out at shit.
They give you your share.
They do?
When you retire.
It's a law they have.
They divide it.
Yeah, what they do is,
so many kilometers of country
divided by however
many people there are.
I don't know. Let's say...
Two square kilometers,
or three.
Whatever it is.
And they give it to you.
-Each one gets his share.
-Shit.
Can you imagine it?
Here, this is for you.
It's yours forever. And you can do
what you fucking want.
And so people are in a better mood.
Because of the climate too.
It's great there, Lino.
The Antipodes.
The Antipodes.
You know why
they're called that?
Because it means ''the opposite''.
''Antipodes.''
Anti-podes.
The oppo-site.
The opposite of here.
You can work there, not here.
You can screw there, not here.
''Antipodes.''
I bet those bastards
are going there.
What day is it today?
Monday.
If I may, your honor,
I'll read the statement
in which,
on November 4 of this year,
in accordance with the decision
adopted by this court...
the accused was found guilty
and sentenced to pay compensation
to the claimant
for breaking the streetlight,
model Urban Swimlight 2 70,
situated eight meters
from the shipyard entrance.
That was accepted at the time
without any argument.
But we would like it to be seen
in the context of the labor dispute
prevailing at the time,
a lockout and the dismissal
of 200 workers,
among them, my client,
which meant that he
and many others
joined the demonstrations
with which we are all familiar
and which ended with
regrettable confrontations
between the workers
and the police.
Bastards.
Consider, therefore,
the events surrounding
the incident
for which my client is being
asked to pay compensation.
But it wasn't
the streetlight's fault.
That's true, your honor.
But it was badly situated.
So it's all the fault
of whoever put it there.
Perhaps...
it could partly be seen
like that, your honor.
Counsel, this is the third time
we've heard this case.
What is the compensation
being demanded?
-8,000 pesetas, your honor.
-8,000 pesetas.
8,000.
How can I pay it?
How can I pay it?
They laid me off.
And now they want me
to pay 8,000 pesetas.
What is this?
I pay them for laying me off?
You broke their streetlight?
Well, now you pay for it.
A lousy streetlight.
No, it was an Urban Swimlight.
8,000 pesetas worth.
I won't pay it.
Santa, this was
the third hearing.
You know what the fourth means.
Do you know or not?
What do you think?
It isn't a matter
of cheap or expensive.
It's cheap for you?
Correct.
Not for me.
Is Jose ugly or handsome?
That depends too.
His wife might like him.
The 8,000 pesetas, for example.
-What are they worth?
-In euros?
In pesetas. What are 8,000 pesetas
worth in pesetas?
-8,000 pesetas.
-No.
No. You see?
For me, morally,
they're worth much more.
-1 0,000?
-Much more. 1 0 million.
More. 1 00,000 million.
How can 8,000
be worth 1 00,000 million?
-Morally. I said morally.
-All right, morally.
It still doesn't seem expensive.
It must be great to be on TV.
Imagine presenting a program.
You go on,
talk a bit of rubbish,
and live like a king.
You know what he gets paid?
I was on TV once.
In an ad, when I was a kid.
I was a good looking kid.
What was it for?
A soft drink. ''Bubbles''.
Remember it?
Orange and lemon flavor.
''Bubbles''?
Never heard of it.
-They went bankrupt very soon.
-Shit, Lino!
''Bubbles''.
Don't know it.
Give me another.
It's your fourth, Jose.
Don't worry, I'll pay you.
That's not what I meant.
Want anything?
You got ''Bubbles''?
Orange or lemon?
Orange, please.
You assholes!
I was on TV too,
about the shipyard.
Is anyone still there?
It was open on Monday.
They're auctioning the machinery.
The bastards.
Careful with the crumbs.
If the foreman sees them,
I'm finished.
-Lino, here.
-Get it out of there. Don't screw up.
-You're going to lose it.
-Get it out.
-You're going to screw up.
-He's on his own. Back him up.
-Kick it over, come on.
-That's it, move up, guys!
-Go on, move up!
-Look at him! He isn't looking!
-Was that Ferrer?
-We need two more floors, Reina.
You lot had a great goalkeeper.
Who was he? Yasine...
-Yashin.
-Yashin.
The Black Spider.
Best goalkeeper in world.
He always wears black.
Everyone is afraid of him.
Opposing player,
when he scores goal,
apologizes to Yashin.
Ball is also afraid of Yashin.
He deflects ball with look.
This needs to be welded.
-Do you need an expert?
-Why, do you know one?
Official first-class welder.
Four years in the yards.
Come over here.
Who wants cheese?
-Watch the crumbs.
-I can't help dropping them.
Put your hand underneath.
Stop be such a pain in the ass,
Reina.
Yeah, you're like my wife.
I'm like your wife?
If I belt you, I won't be like her.
You could tidy my place.
It's a mess.
That's because your wife works.
Are you being smart?
I just said she works.
And she does, doesn't she?
-Yeah, what about it?
-Nothing.
-It seems to bother you.
-It does bother him.
Look, look, look.
I can't see a thing.
Next time, go to the grandstand.
I won't ask you again.
And you, put that down.
Can I borrow it?
Do you want to get me fired?
-You've lots. There's another one.
-Put it down.
Do I have to frisk you
on the way out?
Calm down, Reina.
Don't pull your gun.
Now, now, now...
-Move it up.
-That's it, very good.
Go on, move it up!
Move it!
-Go on, move it upfield!
-Go on.
Go on, go on, go on...
Goal!
Goal!
I bet it was Salva.
He has no patience.
-He gets angry at anything.
-It's the uniform.
It's the uniform.
-He was always like that.
-No, believe me.
-It's the uniform.
-I haven't seen him recently.
-He goes to other bars now.
-Don't be a bastard.
It goes out on its own.
It's a time switch.
What time?
Time.
The only time there is.
That's shit.
It costs more.
So what? You're not paying.
It's Jose.
What's he doing here?
What's up?
Nothing. I'm meeting Santa.
How are your legs?
-Is that why you came?
-Ana...
get back in line!
-Can't I talk to my wife?
-Don't, please.
-He's an asshole.
-You want to get me fired too?
Ana!
Does he know all your names?
I'll see you at home.
Fucking great.
He can't live without you.
AURORA SHIPYARD
It's an ugly son of a bitch.
They should have paid me
for breaking it.
I like it.
Yeah, but you've got no criterion.
You know what criterion is?
If you don't know what it is,
how can you have it?
It comes from the Latin,
criterion,
and...
it means that. Criterion.
The word itself tells you.
Hello, Bizco.
What's up, Jose?
Have you come to work?
-You got a lot to do?
-No, just junkies who sneak in.
It's very quiet here.
Look.
-Is anyone up there?
-Alberto.
Have you got criterion, Jose?
-Criterion? What's he on about?
-I don't know.
-If it isn't here, it's gone.
-I need it for the bank.
What year did you leave?
'9 7.
Tax statement from 1 994, and
the preferential employment list.
All the paperwork is over there.
If you want anything, self-service.
-What about the computer?
-We're not linked up anymore.
When do they start building?
Don't ask me about that,
just about papers.
Could you do them again?
No. I couldn't.
If you were here from '94 to '9 7,
I'll never find them all now.
What about shame?
Have you not found that yet?
We could bring 200 jobless families
to help you find it.
Go to head office
and talk to them.
Don't give me a hard time.
I didn't take anyone's job away.
If I went to head office,
there'd be fucking murder.
Did he know we were coming?
We'll wait a while.
You saw the excavators.
The show house will be ready
in six months.
They'll need permits.
They'll get them.
Whenever they want.
Look, there he is.
Were you out shopping?
What are you doing here?
Keeping an eye on you.
Your wife told us to do it.
-I'll take that up for you.
-I can do it.
-It's four floors.
-Let go, for crissake!
I'll do it myself.
You got someone up there?
I'll be right down,
He's getting really moody.
I'm off.
To work, to maintain you lot
with my taxes.
I'd rather not work
than work as a cop.
Watch it, I'm not a cop.
''Security technician.''
I'll pay for them.
See you later.
-Amador, is your wife back yet?
-She's coming on Monday.
-Want another, Jose?
-No, I've got the bank tomorrow.
-For the loan.
-Will you get it?
We'll see tomorrow.
-Aren't you late?
-I need money for the taxi back.
They'll stop asking you.
Are you babysitting?
Got your books?
My notes.
Call if you need me.
-If there's a problem, call us.
-OK.
His supper is in the fridge.
You have to heat it up for him.
-Can you use a microwave?
-What do you think?
No, but anyway...
Put him to bed at 1 1:00.
Don't give him candy or beer
or anything. He's only four.
He can't see TV.
Don't talk to him
about politics or girls.
My cell phone.
They're due at 2:00.
I'll be here at 1:45.
What if they call?
I've re-routed the calls.
That's for you.
Three? Wasn't it five?
And my commission?
That's how the world works.
Get used to it!
Who are you meeting?
A guy.
You weren't free.
Tell me when the movie ends.
If there's any fighting
or groping, change stations.
You know where to press?
-Here.
-That's it.
Very good.
This whisky is terrific.
The guy's got good taste.
We've all got that,
he's got money.
I wonder what he does.
Can you imagine living like this?
What's the kid's name?
Jorgito...
Luisito...
What's up, kid?
What does your father do?
Russian story says:
Two old party comrades meet,
and one says, ''All that we were
told about communism was a lie.''
The other says,
''Yes, but the worst thing
is that all we were told
about capitalism was true.''
What did you do?
I study in Gagarin Space School.
-You're kidding.
-Many astronauts learn there.
I study 2 7 program
of Soviet Union.
I, in space now,
exactly...
there!
Between big star
and little blue one.
But my program stop.
Soviet Union kaput.
I am here now.
That's life.
Did you know the Russian
was an astronaut?
-What's up?
-Nothing, I'm serious.
He should be up there now.
Hell of a change.
I know what this guy does.
He makes shoes.
-I opened a closet, it was full.
-You opened a closet?
200 pairs, all women's.
They must be his wife's.
-These people have lots of shoes.
-Why did you open it?
I was investigating.
Investigating.
Don't dramatize it.
I'm not. We're here
under my responsibility.
If anything disappears
or happens to the kid...
The kid could have his head
in the oven right now.
You're here because I invited you.
Got that?
And you do as I say.
It's my house and my job
and my child.
But we're helping you,
aren't we?
With the child.
-We're all looking after him.
-What are you on about?
Lino is right.
So we should all share the money.
The 3,000 pesetas?
What else?
Do you want a contract too?
Have you all gone crazy?
-Where are you going?
-To put the child to bed.
''The Grasshopper and The Ant''
Here we go.
''Once upon a time, there was
a grasshopper and an ant.
The ant was very hardworking
and the grasshopper wasn't.
He liked to sing and sleep
while the ant
went about his tasks.
Time went by. The ant worked
and worked all summer.
He saved all he could
and when winter came
the grasshopper was dying
of hunger and cold
while the ant had everything.''
That ant is a real bastard!
''The grasshopper knocked
at the ant's door,
and the ant said to him,
''Grasshopper,
if you had worked as I did
you wouldn't be
hungry and cold now.''
And he didn't open the door!
Who wrote this?
Because this isn't how it is!
That ant is a shit
and a speculator.
And it doesn't say why
some are born grasshoppers.
Because if you are,
you're fucked.
It doesn't say that.
Will Ana like them?
Of course, they're beautiful.
But she's a bit odd.
She takes a size smaller
but with an insole...
Look, look.
Come here and look at this.
Look.
-I have to get up early.
-Didn't you want to be on TV?
Look, look, look.
Good evening.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to ''Guess who is
the biggest dickhead I know''.
Tonight, it's a very close
competition.
On my left, in a checked jacket
which is way out of fashion,
Paulino Ribas, unemployed
and weighing in at 80 kilos.
And on my right,
another considerable dickhead,
last week's champion, Jose Suarez.
A big hand.
-Can I play?
-No, you can't.
This is for Spanish dickheads.
Send your name
and your telephone number
to whatever fucking address
you want.
I don't have phone.
I'm off.
First question. How many hours
is Australia from here?
Let's hear your answer now.
-By plane?
-No, swimming, asshole.
-Ten hours.
-Ten!
1 4, you've lost.
Sergei said ten
and he's an astronaut.
He can't answer
because he isn't from here.
The question is disallowed.
You've lost.
-What did I lose?
-You have just lost
a wonderful job with
a year's salary every month,
a secretary, and the chance of
promotion in Torrevieja, Alicante.
Jose! Wait!
I'm ready!
That isn't all.
Like them?
Very much.
Fit for a princess.
Chosen specially.
I can go to the bank on my own.
We could be there for an hour.
I'm sure I'll have to sign
something.
Don't put on any more,
you don't need it.
Stop it, I smell of fish.
You don't smell of fish.
You smell like a mermaid.
Go on, have your shower.
Now...
A personal loan.
1,500,000, right?
Your pay slip?
She's the one who works.
Great.
-Permanent contract?
-Temporary.
Net monthly wage, 1 1 0,000.
Any bonuses?
No bonuses...
Any other source of income?
Anything in the offing?
Well, well.
Can anyone act
as guarantor for you?
I can.
Someone with an income,
a relative, your parents...
Is it necessary?
It helps.
Is there a problem?
The ad said it was easy.
You know what ads are like.
I'll need a copy
of your marriage certificate.
Sign here, please.
The active person.
Fine.
In ten days,
we'll tell you something.
Why did you put it there?
Excuse me?
Why did you put the form there?
That's its place.
-And that pile?
-Jose, please.
Why not throw it
in the wastepaper basket?
-A committee will study it...
-Committee, my ass!
You think I don't realize?
You think we're retards?
I'm sorry.
Thanks, Jose,
you were a great help!
-There are lots of banks.
-What?
What do you think this is?
He was laughing at me!
He wasn't laughing at you,
or at anyone.
He was doing his job.
He can stuff his job!
-What was that, a trial?
-Yes, it was.
And if they like you
they give you money.
You don't approve?
Fuck you, that's how it is.
No, fuck them.
Nobody puts me on trial.
I don't like their money.
I was asking for the loan.
I'll decide if I like their money!
Right, I'm not the ''active person''.
After all, who am I?
Nobody, a worthless asshole.
Someone they can laugh at.
I knew it.
I should've come alone.
Great. You all on your own.
You work, you ask for the loans.
Great.
-What about me?
-Jose.
I knew that this would happen
as soon as I saw the whisky.
Right, you know everything.
What has happened,
what will happen...
I don't know why
you're filling cans of tuna.
It's more than you can say.
Couldn't you be quiet for once?
-We can go to another one.
-Another one?
What for? To insult them too?
It's always the same.
Look at us. We've got nothing.
No house, no kids,
no loan, nothing.
And it's always
because of fucking work.
Are you awake?
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
1 8, 21, 37,
and 47. And the complementary
number is...
Good morning.
Maybe for you.
JOB SEEKERS
Look.
Whoever wants to suck me off,
raise her hand.
Do you know her?
From the other day.
If they can't give us a proper job
we'll take a blow job.
What can I do?
Put yourself in my place.
They were to send you
the dismissal form.
When did you sign it?
-When I signed the contract.
-That's impossible.
You can't sign the dismissal
and the contract together.
But they were together.
What you have to do
is go home and wait.
An inspector will visit you
and decide about your case.
Meanwhile,
we can't pay you any benefit.
-I've brought the certificate.
-That's no use to me.
You have to wait.
-But I can't wait.
-Samuel, I can't do anything.
They'll ask for proof of dismissal.
You call her, please.
Call my wife and tell her.
See what she says.
Tell her about the inspection,
the dismissal and everything.
Tell her and see
if she understands.
Please, see if she understands.
Anyone call?
-Has she got over it?
-More or less.
She says she has,
but she seems a bit strange.
What does she do?
Nothing.
She doesn't talk.
-She doesn't talk?
-Not much.
And she thinks all day.
That's bad.
-Hello.
-Hello.
I thought you were Swiss,
because of the dress.
I'm not Swiss, the cheese is.
-Want some?
-Yes.
-I warn you, I'm a cheese expert.
-Sure.
Have you been there?
Switzerland?
No, have you?
Skiing.
No, I'm joking. Working.
How's the cheese?
Not bad.
But I like you more.
What's your name?
Angela.
''Spregel.''
Swiss for ''My pleasure.''
''Spregel''.
All right, ''Spregel''.
-May I?
-Of course.
Want some of Angela's cheese?
-I'll go and pay.
-Right.
It also means ''Goodbye''
I'm going out.
-Again? Where?
-For a walk.
-For a walk where?
-Around.
Leave him be.
The question isn't whether
we believe in God or not.
The question is
if God believes in us.
Because if He doesn't,
we're screwed.
I don't know
if I'm explaining myself.
I think He doesn't.
At least,
He doesn't believe in me.
Nor in you, Santa.
In Jose...
He might believe in him
a bit more. I don't know.
But we believe in you
and that's what matters.
Yeah, but you aren't God,
for crissake.
Sergei, does God exist
or not?
Do you see Him
when you're up there?
-Sergei is an astronaut.
-Really?
When Gagarin comes to earth
after first trip
a journalist asks same thing,
if he saw God in space.
And Gagarin says, ''Yes,
I saw comrade God in space,
and He tells me to tell you
that He does not exist.''
Give me another.
I'm closing up, Amador.
It's late.
When's your wife coming back?
If she doesn't come soon,
you'll kill yourself.
What the hell is it to you?
Why are you
talking about my wife?
Do I talk about yours?
Give me another drink.
The lot of you
can go fuck yourselves.
And God doesn't believe in you,
for your information.
-In none of you.
-Don't be angry.
And in you least of all.
I didn't fall.
I threw myself down.
Take him home.
Give me another.
Wait, wait.
Come on, Amador.
It's... You can't.
You can't...
You can't? All right.
No, because...
there's no ticket.
What do you mean?
To get into your house?
What are you talking about?
A ticket.
-You got a ticket?
-Yes, yours and mine.
-We'll go up and I'll show you.
-You don't have a ticket.
They won't fucking let you in.
-We'll buy them upstairs, come on.
-No...
You can't.
Like Siamese twins.
They fight, the dickheads.
What Siamese twins?
The Siamese twins.
You know, Siamese twins?
-No, I don't, Amador. Do you?
-Yes, I do.
Siamese from Siam.
With two heads.
They hang on to each other
as they're born.
Because they're afraid to be born.
And then, afterwards,
they can't separate.
-They fight?
-They fight.
And one of them wins.
He pushes the other one,
who falls.
And he laughs.
But he's falling too.
Understand?
Because they're stuck
to each other.
The two of them fall,
you understand?
It's as if he said,
''Go fuck yourself.''
You understand?
Go fuck yourself!
Go fuck yourself!
You understand?
Shit, Amador.
When your wife comes back...
The light!
Coming!
Jaime Marques.
Paulino Ribas.
Pay it, Santa,
or you'll get in trouble.
What does the lawyer say?
That I should pay.
What if you don't?
It's not certain.
Jail too?
Who knows!
Depends on the judge you get.
You'll have no girls in jail.
And who'll bring you food?
I will, Santa.
Thanks, Nata.
It's to see who's the cockiest.
Don't worry, you'll win.
I'm not going to pay.
I can't.
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
I can't.
That's it, then.
Let's have a last drink with Santa.
A farewell drink.
Christ, all this dignity!
Here, half a streetlight.
But don't get used to it.
Some of us work for our money.
What's up, Lino?
How did it go?
All right.
Give me a drink.
Go on, Reina's being generous.
What are you doing?
I spilt it.
You're an asshole, Santa.
And full of pride.
Yeah, I guess, but I've been
like that for years.
I won't change now.
Right, Amador?
Spregel.
Spregel.
Very elegant.
Yes, well, business...
Is he yours?
Do you like children?
A lot, a lot.
What's up?
You lucky little fucker,
you've got Angela!
That makes it easy.
Are they his?
Yes, we're going to the doctor.
His arm hurts.
Are you a doctor?
More or less.
I worked in a hospital.
In the bar.
And you always pick something up.
This looks fine to me.
This week I'm working evenings.
If you want to drop by...
Do you know Australia?
Australia?
-No.
-Would you like to go?
-Right now?
-No, not right now.
Some time.
You all right?
1,000, 2,000, 3,000,
4,000, 5,000,
6,000, 7,000
and 8,000. That's it.
See how easy it was?
Have an early night.
You did the right thing, Santa.
They were the ones who didn't.
But they can go fuck themselves.
You did what you had to.
Straight ahead.
And you did it well, with style.
You want 8,000 pesetas.
Take them, there they are.
Have a drink on me.
It mightn't seem so,
but these things add up.
They make you grow.
Here.
In your head.
And you look better,
more mature.
Stop.
Here?
I won't be long.
What the...?
Much better.
No, no way.
It's easy to act the victim.
There is work. If it's there for
outsiders, it's there for us.
-And it's there for outsiders.
-All right.
No, it's not all right.
Every month a chunk of my wages
goes to pay a load of layabouts.
It's easy take handouts.
-Lino, he says you're a layabout.
-Don't involve me.
You are involved.
He says that if you wanted to work
you'd go to the south,
earn 80,000 pesetas a month,
spend half on lodgings
and send the rest to your wife.
-I wasn't talking about him.
-No?
About who, then?
Shit, it isn't that hard.
I say you can always
find something.
Look at Rico.
They close the shipyard, lay us
all off and what does Rico do?
He takes his severance pay
and sets up this bar.
And it's going OK, right?
How long ago was that?
Three years.
Yeah, but it could have
gone badly.
Fuck it, no.
Not if you work hard.
Amador.
Amador left at the same time.
-What did he do with the money?
-Wait a minute.
Firstly, he didn't leave.
He was laid off, like all of us.
They're two very different things.
As for the severance pay,
8 million pesetas sounds
like a lot, but then what?
What do you do at 49 with no job,
2 kids and 8 million in the bank?
I'll tell you.
You do nothing.
In 4 years it's gone.
I mean you, Amador, anybody.
And they gave me nothing.
The problem was, it was cheaper
to buy the ships abroad.
I'll tell you what the problem was,
because I was there.
They said, ''We're laying off 80.
It's that or we close down.''
We said no, it wasn't closing.
Our jobs were there,
everyone's jobs,
and you don't mess with our jobs.
It wasn't just casual workers.
You were there, Rico.
And so was Amador.
Defending what was ours.
Mine, José's and Lino's.
There were 200 of us at the sit-in,
casual and permanent workers.
Ask the police,
I'm sure they remember.
And you achieved nothing.
-We made sure people knew about it.
-They've all forgotten now.
And we were united.
I remember that.
Then it got fucked up.
It's easy for you to talk.
You didn't have a family.
What about the men who were 50?
-Who would take us on?
-All right.
You signed the agreement.
I understand.
But you knew it was shit.
You did, didn't you?
-There was nothing else.
-Nothing else. Fucking great.
Is there anything else now?
You guys left a year later.
You got this bar,
it's doing well, I'm delighted.
But others haven't been so lucky.
Amador, for example.
Yeah, but that isn't my fault.
No, it isn't, but you
all signed the agreement.
They laid us off then, and you guys
the year after. And what happened?
What happened?
We weren't united anymore.
They'd divided us.
With the fucking agreement.
And divided, we're screwed.
It's always been like that.
Always.
That's why some of us did OK
and some of us didn't.
That's why Lino
keeps calling his wife
saying he doesn't know,
and maybe they'll call him.
That's why I'm getting
a fucking lousy temper.
All right, but one thing is clear.
I come to this bar,
but if it's cheaper anywhere else,
I'll go there.
It's the same thing. If the Koreans
build cheaper ships...
I don't want to hear any more
about the fucking Koreans!
The shipyard was competitive.
We work fast.
We even offered to do
free overtime to lower costs.
The thing is,
the shipyard is where it is.
The site's worth a fortune.
Why? Because it's beside the sea.
Haven't you seen the excavators?
They'll build luxury apartments
and the fucking Koreans
will come and live in them
and laugh in our fucking faces.
It's as simple as that.
And I wouldn't go anywhere else
even if the drinks were free.
I'm going to keep coming here.
Even if you did sign.
I could get a bar job tomorrow.
But if everyone gets laid off
there'll be no customers.
And that pisses me off.
That pisses me off.
You signed your kids' dismissals.
Their jobs were at stake.
And we lost them.
Pour me another.
Very nice, Santa.
But that was two years ago.
Since then, what?
I haven't seen you
serving drinks.
At least Lino tries.
And good or bad, I've got a job.
-A ''security technician''.
-That's right.
-You like seeing the games.
-Shit, I have to invent half of them.
So stay at home the next time,
asshole.
-Come on, Reina.
-It's true.
He does nothing,
but everything's wrong.
Sure, they're going to come here
looking for you
and offer you a job
just for the hell of it!
We don't all have
a brother-in-law to help us.
Listen, dickhead.
He'd left the company
when I joined.
I got nothing handed to me.
I'm a worker.
-You're a shit with a gun.
-Oh, yeah?
You seemed keen
to find a job there.
Your wife wanted to have me near.
What?
Asshole.
You went too far.
He should shut up about
whether we work or not.
Fuck it, Santa.
You don't care,
you don't like soccer.
It's wrong of you
to make me nervous,
to crush my ambition.
Keep on like that
and you'll soon see.
Where is our mistake
that can't be solved?
Were you the culprit
or was I?
Neither you nor anyone
can change me.
1,000 bells are ringing
in my heart.
Is it so hard
to say you're sorry?
Nata's too much.
You could fucking tell.
No, you just think that.
It was everything.
The way she laughed,
the way he touched her hand.
He likes your wife.
It's natural.
What do you mean?
-Shit, you like her too.
-That's different.
OK, but it's normal he likes her.
Your wife's a looker.
-Do you like her too?
-Of course.
What's the big deal?
If she's a looker, she's a looker.
It's normal that we all like her.
Hey, you're talking about my wife.
I agree, she's your wife.
So you agree with me on that.
I agree with you on everything,
but I disagree.
I'm sure it's nothing.
They're friends,
they work together.
It's normal.
-He took her hand.
-Her hand! Big deal.
-Why didn't she tell me?
-Because she knew you'd be angry.
Ask her.
-Talk to her.
-I'll do that.
Good.
It'll reassure you.
I'm going to talk to her.
Two more drinks.
Listen, Jose.
To talk, you have to go home.
Not order another drink.
Yeah, right, but I have to think
what I'm going to say.
What if she leaves me?
She won't.
Yeah, but if she does?
This is the story of
a dream that made me happy,
because when I dreamed it
it touched my heart...
Look at Lino.
Come on.
Come on.
I was flying,
oh-oh.
I was singing,
oh-oh-oh-oh.
Along a path of blue,
happy among clouds of tulle,
I was flying up to the sun.
And I picked
a bunch of stars as I passed,
while I left
the unhappy world far below.
And sweet music played
just for me.
I was flying,
oh-oh.
I was singing,
oh-oh-oh-oh.
Talking...
It's important. It's how people
understand each other.
Talk things through.
Talking things through.
Are you off?
-Hello, Santa.
-Hello.
-I was waiting for you.
-I got held up.
So I see.
We have to talk.
What about?
Later, all right?
-So long.
-'Bye.
She wants to talk.
That's good, right?
You wanted to talk too.
No, you did. I wanted things
to be the same.
And they will be.
Want one for the road?
I can't. See you tomorrow.
You meeting somebody?
The cheese girl?
He looks happier.
Any word of his wife?
Your Colleagues on the Board
What's that?
A wreath, can't you see?
Who sent it?
The Royal Household,
who the hell do you think?
Your Colleagues
Sorry.
How was it?
All right.
Normal.
Nobody went,
just us from the bar.
Did you call the doctor?
I can hardly feel them.
It's like I didn't have them.
Mermaids don't have legs.
Do they know what happened?
He was drinking a lot.
He used to have it under control.
He was always in the bar.
Then he'd go home.
Or someone took him.
He was on his own.
Santa told us,
he went up with him once.
His wife had left.
I guess she got tired.
It's normal.
But he said nothing.
Not to anybody.
He'd drink and go home.
No one was waiting for him.
That's why he didn't
want to leave.
Maybe he didn't have
the strength to go on.
Or maybe not.
Maybe he fell.
What difference does it make?
Anita...
What's wrong?
For example,
to exit, Control Q.
You use Control,
you go up
and Enter.
Clear some space.
How are you getting on?
Carlos Fuentes.
Paulino Ribas.
Paulino Ribas?
Sergio Esteban.
WAY OUT
And it was starting
to look so nice.
I've seen the lots.
For the auction.
No, it's a raffle.
Among the workers.
I got number 8, I think.
Yeah, 8.
What about you?
Come off it.
Really, I'm coming tomorrow
to pick it up.
Which one did you get?
No.
Yes, there's a list inside.
-Really?
-Really.
Go and see.
Go and see!
No.
You're missing out.
I'll get yours.
Yeah, right.
What are you doing?
Christening it.
Christening it!
THE SHIPYARD
It's really ugly.
Don't be sad, Nata.
He's happier now.
What'll we do with it?
We could leave it in his corner.
Yeah, or beside the fucking ham.
-He spent his life there.
-Up beside the trophies?
What are you doing?
One for the road.
-For crissake.
-It's Amador. We're pals.
The bastard.
He didn't say anything.
He did.
But he was hard to understand.
Like...
Like Siamese twins.
They're stuck together.
We're stuck together too.
I didn't say that.
Amador said it.
If one falls, we all fall.
And if one gets fucked...
That's it.
So do the others.
Because we're the same thing.
The same thing.
Like Siamese twins.
The same thing.
It's locked.
Oops, it broke!
Right, get the others.
We're off!
Can you sail this?
I worked on a ship.
-In the kitchen.
-Yeah, but on a ship.
Shall we start?
Where's the urn?
-You had it.
-No, Lino did.
-You were holding it.
-In the bar, then Rico gave it you.
No, he didn't.
-Yes, in the street, I saw him.
-No.
Weren't you with Rico?
I don't have.
You haven't left it somewhere?
-I never touched it.
-You always lose things.
I might fucking lose things,
but I wouldn't lose a pal's ashes.
Poor Amador!
What day is today?
