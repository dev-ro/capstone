So what do you think, Joe?
I don't know.
I don't think that's for me to say.
A second chance?
I mean, it's a nice idea, but...
But?
- How do you feel?
- Feel?
I feel that I was a nightmare.
I made terrible choices.
I drove my family away. I...
I hurt people.
I didn't mean to, but there it is.
And for all that...
there's a hole inside me now.
It hurts. I carry it.
Like Phil Coakley hurts?
Of course not.
But I know the work I've done.
You've seen that.
Yeah.
- Yeah. I have.
- Right.
I got almost six years.
That's real.
That's clarity.
I can't do anything about before.
That's done.
But I can show people I've changed.
Like with my behavior.
And my girls.
I can be their father again.
And that's what you want?
That's all there is.
A second chance.
Why not?
I have faith in you, Joe.
Thank you, Morris.
Let's go.
Would you like to take communion
before you go?
Oh, no. I'm good.
Yeah.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.
Mother's got
her soup line today late.
I think we expected to see you next week.
- Ah, she'd have meant to be here.
- It's okay.
Well, she'd have meant to be here.
Wait. Here.
Retired, huh?
Yeah. I couldn't hump the lines anymore.
Look, uh, you know,
such a long trip up there
and my back being what it is.
- I know.
- Still, we should have.
- I just, uh...
- I know.
They brought some of your stuff back
when they closed your apartment.
It's downstairs in your space
if you wanna...
Sure.
Hmm.
Oh, no.
Hey, baby.
I missed you too.
The number
you've reached is not in service...
- Where'd they move to?
- We don't know.
We haven't spoken to Elaine
since you went up.
What about the girls?
Birthdays? Christmas?
We are not in touch anymore.
- You never called?
- She wouldn't accept 'em.
Well, she's not obligated to.
The settlement was clear...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I contested that fucking settlement.
A clean break now, Joe,
while the girls are young.
It's a shame, but maybe she's right.
Can I borrow the truck?
- Your mother will be home...
- Dad.
I've been indoors six years. Please.
Hello?
Melissa?
Yeah?
It's Daddy, sweetie.
It's your dad.
My dad?
Uh-huh.
How are you, baby?
Hmm. Good.
How's your sister?
She's okay.
That's great.
Um, you know, I...
I've been away because...
Well, I had to be away.
It wasn't my fault.
Well, it was, but I was sick and...
But now... now I'm better, see, and we...
Can you hold on?
Melissa. Melissa, wait. Wait. I love you.
Joe?
Hey, sweetie.
How did you get this number?
I know.
I just wanted to talk to the girls.
Joe, you know that's not allowed.
- I should be able to speak to my...
- Listen to me.
You're violating your agreement.
Agreement?
- You call again...
- Why are you...
I'll press charges.
Well, this is...
Joe's such a bad boy.
- Sucker.
- Sorry. Sorry.
Ahhh.
Joe motherfuckin' Denton.
- Shit. Scotty. Look at you.
- Look at you.
Goddamn. It's good to see you.
Uh, get one, and put that on mine.
- That's kind of you, man. Cheers.
- Oh, it's the least I can do.
It's the least I can do, man.
I figure you and Billy were...
You were like brothers,
so that makes us like brothers, so...
- Hey.
- To bein' home.
And to my brother Billy.
To home and to Billy.
I... I just... I wanted to say hey,
welcome you back.
If you need anything...
- Thanks, man. Good to see ya.
- Give me a call.
You know, I come in here a lot,
and I'm pretty sure
I've never seen you before.
I'm new.
- New used, maybe.
- Mm-hmm.
But it's what's under the hood
that counts.
- Yep.
- Right?
Not the paint job. The ride is just so...
I get it. Cars.
Enjoyable.
Do you, uh...
wanna buy me a Sucker Punch?
Oh, boy.
I don't know what that is.
Drinks.
Hey!
Hey.
Now what?
No. No.
No, I, uh... I gotta go home.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
That's boring.
Wanna give me a ride home at least?
Please.
Pretty please?
Pretty, pretty please?
You sure this is the right way?
Yeah. It's, uh, straight down there.
It's right over there.
♪ Why'd you go away? ♪
♪ I told you I'd get clean, girl ♪
Okay.
You know...
I thought you
were gonna try something with me.
- I'm just giving you a lift.
- Hmm.
You didn't ask my name.
What's your name?
Cara.
Cara Coakley, you motherfucker.
Help! Somebody help me!
Coffee?
I'd say it's good to see you again,
but I feel sick just being this close.
- Nice to see you too, Dan.
- Lieutenant Pleasant.
Don't you dare use the informal with me,
you fucking degenerate.
You're an everlasting disgrace
to this department,
and if Officer Barnett wasn't here,
I would tune you up myself
on general principle.
Let me ask you something.
Did Manny Vassey or any of his animals
visit you inside?
Was it worth it,
selling your soul to them?
You Judas fuck.
Where's the DA?
Isn't he coming?
Look, Phil, this is not how I want...
One of those young men
is in intensive care.
The one with the nunchakus?
His father is an alderman.
I don't give a shit if they're astronauts.
Charge me.
Put those assholes on the stand
and watch 'em come apart like wet bread,
because you know exactly what this is.
They're parked in the middle of nowhere
with ninja weapons,
precisely where and when their girlfriend
happens to get assaulted?
Come on. Be serious.
Now, your daughter built herself
a cute little frame,
but there's no way this ends
in anything but a civil suit
that buys me your fucking house.
You're right.
I spoke with Cara just now.
She's, uh, quite shaken by what happened.
She's been, uh, angry lately.
She, uh...
Do you wish to press charges?
In light of the statement given by my...
Cara,
regarding the events of this evening...
you have the right to press
criminal battery charges
against the men who attacked you,
- and my office will issue arrest warrants.
- Hmm.
Ah, forget it.
It's in the past.
Phil.
If I could change what happened, I would.
But I paid my time.
I just want everything
to stay in the past.
Like you want Billy Caldwell
to stay in the past?
You're batting zero, shithead.
Goddamn, I miss high school.
I just passed a kid in the lot
molesting his girlfriend
in the backseat of his '82 Datsun.
Kind of impressed that Phil's kid
went for hard stuff like that.
She always seemed
like kind of a flake to me.
But then the mother did leave
after the, uh...
So that's gotta be kind of rough.
You look like you lost a little weight.
Usually all that starchy food they...
What's up, Dan?
How's that for manners
after all I've done for you?
Hey.
Six years in county
beats 12 years in the state house.
Those boys down there would've
spread you out like my crazy aunt's quilt.
Yeah, that was Manny's grease, not yours.
Speaking of the king...
- I didn't ask for this.
- So give it back.
Uh-huh.
You heard about Manny?
What?
Cancer.
In the butt. Matter of time now.
Well, he had a good run.
Junior can steer things now.
Nothin' to do with me.
- Clean slate, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you're on the hook here, Joey.
Manny's gotta go.
You...
You said cancer.
Before then. Now. Yesterday.
Fuck are you talking about?
That old-time religion.
Old man's found God.
Cravin' salvation by way of confession.
Bullshit. He'd never flip.
Old Manny wouldn't,
but dying's made him smaller.
So let's consider now
specifically the kinds of things
that he might confess to.
Say, vis-à-vis, you.
Yeah.
Now you're seein' it.
You think Phil's comment
about Bill Caldwell was coincidental?
- Manny's talking to Phil?
- Crazy, right?
First he wants Phil hit,
then his asshole's melting
and he wants to give him absolution.
Christ forgives. The sinner is saved.
All of that.
Phil's nudging him towards a deposition,
and if he lives long enough, a grand jury.
But even if not, you'd be inside so fast,
your bunk would still be warm.
And no favors this time.
What do we do?
“We”? You got a turd in your pocket?
You know, Phil's been trying
to butt-fuck you since forever,
and if Manny sings, he can do it.
And if you do get keistered,
I'd worry I'm next in line,
and let me tell you
what ain't gonna happen.
If I was gonna roll over,
wouldn't I do that
before serving my fucking time?
- I did the job they wanted...
- No, half the job. Semantics.
Fuck you. I took the fall.
You be sure and send her
some flowers now, son.
The point is, you left Phil breathing
all those years ago,
or it wouldn't be a problem now.
The way I see it, it's your mess.
But hey,
I'm more into carrots than sticks, so...
let's talk about your girls instead.
Junior high by now, hmm?
Family court judge by the name of Winthrop
found himself “over-served” one evening
a while back.
And he dented up the front of his Prius
with the skull of an address-free citizen.
You might say I helped him sweep that up.
And I know that he would fall all
over himself doing me a favor in return.
Like revising your custody deal,
for instance,
so you can see your daughters again.
What am I thinking? I gotta drive.
Manny goes. You get your girls back.
That's the carrot.
The stick? Who wants to think about that?
Do it fast.
Answer me on that if I call.
Don't make me come after you.
He lives.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, I guess you needed the rest.
That's okay.
- Is that a bruise?
- Oh, no.
That was there already. From a door.
- You need a hand?
- Nah. Makin' soup.
Hard time sleeping.
- Well, this is a big adjustment.
- Mmm.
Give it time.
I'm sorry I wasn't here
when you arrived. I...
- I, uh... I already told him.
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Got our wires crossed, I guess.
- Hmm.
- What are your...
- Dad says...
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- No, no, you first.
I was just wondering
what are your plans for work.
I haven't been home a day yet.
It's a reasonable question.
Your first night home
and you're out till dawn
with your father's truck.
I just don't want things
going back to how they were.
Not here.
Dad says you don't speak
to your grandchildren.
That's Elaine's decision.
We just want what's best for them.
What about me?
It's impossible to you
that I might have changed?
You know...
every Sunday in church...
I have to see Phil Coakley.
And everybody there sees me seeing him.
Have you ever thought
what that might feel like... to me?
Have you changed?
You know what this is?
You expect me to be impressed
'cause you didn't drink in jail?
Dad! Come on!
Look, see, this is complicated.
No, it's not.
You say you've changed.
Good. I hope it's true.
I've prayed for it long enough.
I'm happy you're home, and I love you,
but you don't get extra points
for doing what's simply required,
what everybody else does.
- I can't believe this shit.
- You have work to do, Joe!
I am profoundly sorry, Phil.
Bill Caldwell. Billy was my friend.
And I just wish he'd... he'd...
worked the steps.
Hi, Phil.
I was out of line,
the way I spoke to you last night.
I thought about this a lot,
what I wanted to say to you
when I finally saw you,
and that wasn't it.
What I did wanna say
was that I am profoundly sorry.
I was truly in fear for my life.
I felt I was defending myself,
but that doesn't excuse the...
I don't even remember it. Insane.
- Which is it?
- Which?
You were in fear for your life
or you don't remember.
Which is it?
The point is, I do take responsibility,
and I'm ready to move ahead
with a... with a clean life, a good life.
Take responsibility and just...
You know. Amends.
You mentioned Bill Caldwell.
He was my friend.
I loved him.
I just wish he'd gotten
into the program like I have,
worked the steps.
There's a whole other world
you can live in.
He just didn't know.
You are within 100 yards of my home here.
But I'm not interested in some
chickenshit restraining order violation.
For you, I want the needle.
- And I'm gonna get it.
- Okay.
Okay.
“Anger eats the vessel.”
I guess you heard, huh?
How's he doing?
Can I, um...?
He took care of me in there.
Hey, Manny.
Ha.
You're on the same drugs as me.
- How you feeling?
- Eh.
I'm working on my anger.
- What?
- Oh, nothing.
That's not something
I thought I'd ever hear you say.
What'd it ever get me?
All this. Lots of things.
Yeah, well, I don't want 'em anymore.
Dan gave me a bag.
- You did your bid.
- Yeah.
But I blew the job.
And I warned you
about the drinking and the drugs.
You did.
I should've listened,
but since I didn't...
I guess I was expecting someone
to clip me in there,
not pay me when I came out.
If you knew how much it cost
to sell that imperfect self-defense line.
Manny, come on.
Yeah, I admit.
I was angry about Phil.
You blew our clean shot at him.
Hmm.
But since you'd
already taken care of Billy...
even though he went over to them...
he was your boy.
So that meant something.
I bet Junior disagreed, huh?
Yeah, well, Junior has a lot of...
A lot of different ideas
about a lot of things.
Funny you mention talking to Phil.
- Give me that fuckin' thing. I hurt.
- In a sec.
Because what I hear,
there's this notion floating now
that maybe Billy wasn't an accident.
- There's always talk.
- Manny.
Are you talking to the DA? Huh?
You know, sometimes when I'm sleeping...
I think I see what hell looks like...
and it ain't fire and it ain't devils.
You know what it is?
It's just me.
And I ain't no goddamn stool pigeon.
I'm sorry.
I don't know. I...
It's been a tough few days, is all.
Tough, yeah.
Tough for everybody.
He nodded out.
Pressed the thing there and just...
It's the pain. We upped the dosage.
We should probably let him rest.
Of course. Of course.
I'm Joe.
Charlotte Boyd.
Old friend.
So how is he... I mean, it's bad, huh?
I'm a hospice worker.
Yeah, well, he's a fighter.
Charlotte?
Thank you for taking care of my friend.
You're gonna sit there
with your stupid fuckin' shirt
and tell me I can't see my own father?
My kids can't go?
He just wants you to call first, Junior,
that's all.
Oh, I see.
Did this cocksucker call first?
Hey, Junior.
- I thought we were gonna see Poppy.
- Wow.
Go inside
and play the quiet game, okay?
Oh, man. You guys are so big.
Hey, close that door behind you.
The A/C's on, all right?
- Goddamn, they grow so fast.
- Yeah, how you doin', Joe?
Now, you lay there with your hands
on your scrotum and you listen.
You are not welcome here.
This is a family time,
and this family no longer has any use
for dumb-fuck, grief-causing policemen.
Now, you come around here again
bothering my father,
disturbing his rest...
and I'm gonna bring you down
to my playroom.
Yeah. You know what happens there.
All right. Come on. Let's get up.
I think we'd all feel better
if you moved on.
Hey, Junior?
Any idea what Phil Coakley
talks to your dad about?
Besides the Bible, I mean.
Now, why would you say
something like that?
I mean, all these years
my father carries your crazy ass,
you're implying
he's some kind of rat or something?
All right.
Yo, break this motherfucker's mouth.
Hi.
Uh, can I have a coffee, please?
Thank you.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Here.
Thank you.
No, thank you
for taking care of my friend.
You said that already.
Hmm.
Are you from Bradley originally?
I moved from Montreal
around two years ago.
- You got family?
- No.
I... Well, uh, no.
Do you work there every day
at Manny's house?
- Six days a week usually.
- Hmm. Wow.
And all of his... I don't know...
Uh, medication and monitoring
and all that, that's all you?
That's me.
And another girl. We do split shifts.
Wow.
That must feel like a big responsibility.
I guess it is. I don't feel overwhelmed.
No?
But I'm good at helping people.
I guess your agency provides you
with supplies and medication and whatnot
for there at the house.
My father had lymphoma.
And...
They had him on
so much different stuff there.
At the end...
he didn't know what day it was.
- I'm sorry. It's a terrible disease.
- Yeah.
Actually, I just moved back here myself.
Everyone's gone now.
I was, uh, doing some consulting...
Whoa.
Oh!
- What the fuck?
- Sergeant Thom Doyle,
retired, IUPA local.
And you, sir,
are a worthless goddamn punk.
Ooh.
I think I'm gonna skip this one.
Do you think
you might wanna get together again?
Like I said, everyone's gone now, and...
I like you.
Whoo!
You know, if you want,
I could set you up with Toni.
Little, uh, welcome-home toss?
You know we take care of cops here.
Bring that pussy over here, girl. Yeah.
Hell, your old buddy, he's on a weekly.
Come on. Come on. What's wrong? Hey!
Bruno. Fuck. Get that fucker out of here.
All right, come on.
Get the fuck out.
- Who's the peacock?
- It's her old man.
They got this whole jealousy thing going.
Anyway, if you wanna spend
some time with Toni, it's on me.
- Pass.
- Suit yourself.
Hey, you want any, uh...?
Oh, no, thanks.
Whooooo!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Marion Barry tonight
delegated many of his duties
as mayor of the nation's capital
but did not resign.
The word of this came hours
after the DC mayor was brought
before a federal magistrate...
Excuse me.
That is not your vehicle.
Oh, Dad... Dad said it was fine.
Where have you been all day?
And why are you rushing in like this?
For your information, I went to a meeting.
- Where?
- What?
Where was the meeting you were at?
I... It's anonymous, Mom.
We're not gonna do things like this.
I'm telling you right now.
- I'm doing everything I can!
- All right, okay.
I wish I could believe you, Joe,
but you make it so hard.
No. You make it so hard,
because you don't want to believe in me.
I said “believe,” not “believe in.”
- See?
- Now, listen.
The onus is on you.
What difference does it make
when you're determined to judge me?
Could I have some support here, please?
Oh, no, wait, wait. Mom.
Fuck it. I'll be gone soon anyway.
What's that supposed to mean?
This behavior is precisely
why you lost your family, Joseph!
Ahhh.
Mmm.
- Would you like another one?
- No, thanks.
What?
Thank you.
For asking me here.
I don't usually... And...
Feels nice.
Like I said, I like you.
Me too.
So, Montreal.
What prompted the move south?
Polarity.
Weather systems.
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know.
Do you ever feel like
you're living in the wrong skin?
Sometimes I'll wake up
in the middle of the night
and I'll go to get a glass of water,
and I'll just catch myself in the mirror,
and I don't recognize myself at all.
It's like someone else has come
into my bathroom and just stood there.
Does that ever happen to you?
Sure.
Hmm.
Do you...?
Oh, yeah.
I... I'm just gonna go...
Do you... Do you want a drink or something?
Okay. And you?
Yes.
Just...
Okay.
I like your place.
It's what I have.
Cheers.
Why me?
'Cause you're good.
I think everything happens
for a reason, you know?
Like what?
Meeting you.
No, really. I...
I've been having kind of a hard time.
Just alone, you know?
Things... just f-feel different now.
- Hmm.
- Hope that's not weird to say.
Anyways, so, yeah.
Do you have any other clients?
Other than Manny, I mean.
I noticed you had, I don't know,
looked like, uh...
pharmaceuticals or something in there.
The reason I ask is because,
before I moved back,
one of the firms I was consulting for
had this guy...
Oh, Joe.
No, it's true. He was... Really...
Really? “Consulting”?
You were in jail.
It was in the paper.
Your picture was in the paper.
“Slash Cop,” it said, which just is...
What happened?
Didn't you read it?
I'm asking you.
I was very drunk. Um...
Coming home from a place downtown.
Apparently I bumped into him, the lawyer.
And, uh...
There was a fight, and I hurt him. Badly.
- It said you had a knife.
- I thought he was gonna...
It was dark, and I-I-I, um...
If you knew...
Because I know what it means
to need a second chance.
And I didn't know you
when you did those things.
I know you now.
Hello?
Didn't wake your girl, did I?
I was hoping I would've heard
some sort of “In Memoriam” item by now
about our mutual patron.
I fucking tried. Junior was there.
- Whoa.
- Yeah, exactly.
I can't get that close again.
If anything other than cancer
happens to Manny,
I'll be the first one he comes after.
Figure it out.
Put in some work
instead of gettin' your dick wet.
I was working. She's the nurse there.
- Oh. Good thinkin'.
- Yeah. Except that won't work either.
- Why not?
- It just... won't.
There's no access. Trust me.
All that matters is that there
isn't a case brought against you.
Phil is the only one eager to throw bombs,
and everybody else knows that
the Vasseys are good for business.
So if you can't clip Manny,
clip the mutant.
There's no time left.
Just make it look right, is all.
Joe! Pick up the phone. It's for you.
Joe! Joe! Http://archiveha.org/.
- Yeah.
- Joseph Denton?
- Yeah.
- This is Anthony Getman
with the Bradley Post-Release Program.
You have your office check-in
and urinalysis appointment today.
Hello?
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.
Fuck.
- Hello?
- It's Joe.
- I need your help.
- Who is it?
Joe.
Oh, hey, man. Come on up.
Seriously, Joe, it's no problem.
Positive?
The, uh, reserves piss test randomly,
so I, uh...
stick to booze.
You can keep the cup.
- Thanks, man. I owe ya.
- No.
Hey, Joe,
can I ask you something straight up?
Sure.
Back then was there ever any, uh...
I don't know...
Any talk about what happened to Billy
maybe wasn't an accident?
I mean,
we all know he was a lush,
but falling asleep on the tracks?
Wasn't my case, but I knew the guys
who drew it. They worked it right.
Why, um...
Why now?
Phil Coakley called me.
He wants me to come in.
Mm-hmm. He say why?
He said they're gonna impanel a grand jury
and, uh, reopen it as a homicide.
Based on what?
“New information” is all he would say.
It's like he wanted to dangle it
in front of my face.
Fuckin' prick.
Whatever Phil says he's got, it's smoke.
He's fishing.
He's got a hard-on for the Vasseys.
Always has.
There was talk about Junior,
maybe he'd been around the tracks
that night.
But they could never back it up.
It was what it was.
A shitty accident, like you said.
I'm sorry, man.
I never liked Phil anyway.
I was glad when you fucked him up.
Thanks, man. All right.
Hey, buddy.
- Hey, fellas!
- Hey, Dan!
Yeah, now he gets it.
Get it all out.
Okay.
Up you go. Come on.
This thing works pretty good, huh?
Now, I didn't wake up in this mood.
I was thinking, “Don't worry. My pal Joey
will carry his water on this thing.”
But then I hear, uh, no.
This Caldwell grand jury
is, uh, in motion after all.
- I know.
- Did I tell you time was short?
Did I tell you what was coming?
And what did you do but fuck around.
I'll just take my chances in court.
Buddy, you know I wouldn't be able
to let you do that.
Then I'll run.
Well, that either.
Do I need to recharge your battery?
F-Fu... I can't do Manny. I can't do Phil.
You name a third way or get the fuck out.
I just bought a new gas grill.
Stainless steel.
Got an infrared system on it.
To be honest,
I don't even know what that means.
But if you think that I wouldn't buy
some crackhead nigger
for 500 bucks
to come into your parents' house
and slit their throat while they sleep...
if it meant that I got to keep that grill,
you got me mixed up with somebody else.
Manny's deposition is Monday morning.
Thirty-six hours.
Now, you fix it before then,
or I'll assume that we're at odds.
And then... goddamn,
everything's on the table.
And I really do like your folks.
Kelley's.
Hey, it's me.
Hey, hey, hey. How you feelin' today?

Do you know, I was thinking
maybe I'd want to talk to Toni.
- You mentioned preferentials.
- Yeah.
So you know when she sees Dan then?
Or... Or where?
Dan? I never mentioned Dan.
I was talking about Phil Coakley.
How else do you think that Frankenstein
motherfucker's getting any pussy?
Where'd you meet him?
English Garden Inn, off 68.
Same room or different room?
He had a retainer on number 27,
on account of it's a queen size.
- Can you get him to see you again?
- I don't wanna see him.
A grand.
Thousand dollars?
Cash. After.
I think I can do it.
Good boy. Which one?
Neither.
I got a way to freeze Phil out.
Nobody gets hurt.
Oh, girl, did I knock a fuse loose?
I can back him off. No grand jury,
no Manny Vassey. It's done.
You must have a hell of a wedge.
Bradley's most saintly public official.
Solicitation, on tape.
Ha! Is that real?
I'm looking at it.
I'll be goddamned.
Phil's still got some gas in his tank
after all.
He is mighty precious
about his reputation,
but, still, blackmail's messy,
you ain't careful.
Nobody dies, Dan. It's clean.
So long as it's chilled.
It will be.
That's my boy.
Thanks.
You seem different.
How's that?
I don't know.
Lighter.
Mmm.
Things are gonna work out.
Maybe they already have.
I'm gonna have a shower.
All right.
Yeah?
I told him I'd see him again
if he laid off the Jesus.
He damn near jumped through the phone.
Great. I'll be right there.
I'll call you tonight!

And now back to
our Friday night presentation.
Hmm.
Bitch, I knew it!
Police! Stay in your room!
Shit!
No.
Joe.
I gotta talk to you.
All right.
I read this while you were inside.
I didn't know there was a name for it.
I have always known
since you were little...
there was something in you.
And I didn't do anything about it.
I've done a lot of soul-searching...
about my part in what happened to you.
- Dad, you didn't do anything.
- Let me finish.
That's what I'm saying.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't make you run with wild people.
I didn't make you gamble all that money.
I didn't make you take drugs
or drink liquor
or be so goddamn angry all the time, Joe.
I knew how you were.
I did nothing to help.
I am sorry, Joe.
For that I am truly sorry.
But I've gotta do something about it now.
For your mother, for me...
maybe for you.
I don't know.
But this cannot continue.
Give me the keys.
Dad...
Give me the keys.
Tomorrow morning.
You're gonna have to leave.
Dad, I'm leaving right now.
Joe?
Where is it?
I will not have dirty money in my house.
It's not dirty money. It's my money.
Who keeps that much money in a bag
unless it's dirty money?
You have no right to go through my stuff!
We have every right!
Where did it come from? Where?
What's the difference?
I'm leaving! You get your wish!
My wish is to have my son back.
- All right...
- I don't know who you are!
- Take it easy, Joe.
- Mom.
I'm going. Okay? I'm going.
But I need that bag.
- Mm-mmm.
- I am dead without it.
So where is it? Please.
Please.
No. No!
No!
What the fuck?
You...
have been in touch this whole time?
The best thing
that ever happened to those girls
was to get away from their father.
Remember, you had everything
and you destroyed it all!
- Fuck you!
- Just stop!
You'll never hate me
as much as I hate myself!
Oh, no, you don't!
You don't get to turn this into
a little pity party!
This is beyond your little feelings!
When did you ever care how I felt?
That's all I ever cared about!
And I don't hate you!
I hate what you've done to this family!
Where's the fucking money?
Joe! 911! Joe, call 911!
- Oh!
- Call 911, Joe!
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Joe!
- Aaah!
Dad?
Dad?
Who did it?
Junior Vassey or-or Dan Pleasant.
I don't know.
Your friends.
Oh.
You bring mayhem with you, Joe.
I fucked up.
Then what happened was...
I got behind with my bookie.
It started slow, ya know,
couple of Sundays of bad luck.
Next thing I know, I'm underwater.
I kept thinking, “Aw, I'll sort this out.”
“I'll dig out from this.
My daughters...
when they look at me, when they look
at my face, they'll forgive me.”
Me and another cop...
a guy named Dan...
we did whatever Manny said,
and he said, “Do terrible things.”
Now it...
It's happening all over again.
He's gonna talk about all that now,
Manny is, and when he does...
that prosecutor's
gonna give me the death penalty.
Assuming Dan doesn't kill me first.
You don't know that.
You don't.
We're not defined by our pasts.
You've remade yourself.
You've chosen to be a good man.
It's a choice. That's all it is.
In prison, uh, there was a chaplain.
Chaplain Morris.
And he sat with me for...
For fuckin' years.
I'm tellin' ya, if someone tells you
for that long that you can be forgiven...
You're the only one who made me feel
like maybe he was right.
He was.
I need money to run.
- Let's go.
- Hey, guys.
I'm gonna go.
Big time.
But...
you're gonna see the playroom first.
Junior, you don't have to do this. I...
I swear I'm gonna leave.
What-Whatever Phil is gonna do
with your Dad had...
My dad?
My father... is dead.
He was a great man. A king.
And...
Well, they'll never be
another one like him, right, fellas?
- Fuck yeah.
- Hmm.
Don't, don't! No!
Your girlfriend isn't
the most competent nurse I've ever seen.
Jesus Christ, you sound like she did.
But don't worry. You'll see her again.
Where is she?
Out there.
Let's go.
We're gonna go in there together,
you and me.
We are gonna go down there
and work it all out.
We got all day, don't we?
There's nothing to work out. Uh...
I didn't do anything. It wasn't me.
That's not what she said.
We don't have to do this.
It wasn't me.
- All right, come on.
- No. No!
No. No. No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no! No!
No, no, no, no, no!
Who the fuck is this?
Aaah!
I'll kill you, Junior!
Die, motherfucker!
I see you, Junior!
I see you back there, bitch!
There you go, Junior! There you go!
Get some!
Get some!
Now, Bill is my brother!
Suck my cock, you fuckin' retard!
Fuck it.
Fuck, man.
Joe?
Hey, Joe.
You hold on, okay? You just hold on.
Scotty, you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
Good.
You're gonna be fine.
- Getting you help.
- Yeah?
'Cause...
you were like a brother to Billy.
That makes you like a brother to me,
right?
That's right.
Except he didn't fall
on any fucking train tracks, did he?
Not the way they said.
You... put him there.
That's crazy, Scotty. Just...
We're almost there, okay?
Junior... told you to do it.
And you did it.
I talked to Phil about it, you know?
- He's not such a bad guy.
- Did you...
Did you maybe take a shot at my house,
Scotty?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah.
You slick motherfucker, you.
Hey, Dan.
Thought you said your plan
was “no bodies.”
But I ain't complainin'.
You do some work on his brakes or what?
His what?
Phil's car.
Bitch, I knew it!
Motherfucker.
Got into a smashup last night.
Went up in smoke.
You did it. You're free.
Now we'll get started with the judge,
get your girls back.
Yes, sir, a brand-new day, Joey.
A brand-new day.
How is she?
She's gonna live.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
What are you doing with that?
You want it?
- What are you doing with it?
- I'm taking it to the girls.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not trying to buy them.
Just gonna give it to 'em.
Most of it.
See them once more, and then I'll just...
No, you're not.
You are going nowhere near those girls.
Money, no money, I don't care.
You will never be in proximity enough
that your damage and mayhem
ever touches them, not even for a second.
I promise this to you, Son.
This will not happen if I am alive.
Bye, Dad.
I'm... sorry for everything.
No, you're not listening.
I said it will not happen.
I said no.
Stop me.
Oh!
