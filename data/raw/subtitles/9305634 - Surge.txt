London Stansted
is a smoke-free airport
and smoking is only permitted...
..Pass the light.
Here it is.
Sweet, sweet, sweet.
Yeah...
Come through for me.
Excellent, it's round this way.
Hands out by your sides,
away from your waist. Perfect.
If you make your way down
to my colleague, go down there...
Just on this side. Thank you.

- Yep.

Okay.

Oh, sorry!

Excellent. Come through for me.

Awesome. Next one. Excellent.
Hands by your side, like in the photo.
Feet on the footprints, please.
Do you have anything
in your pockets?
Hands by your sides.
Excellent, stay still.
Into the box for me. Thank you.
Joseph, got one coming down with shoes.
Joseph.
Down to my colleague, please.
Stand here, sir.
Got anything in your pockets?
- Sharp objects?
- I have ticket.
Got anything in your pockets,
any sharp objects?
I, I speak little, little English.
I have to search you, sir.
Arms up. Arms out.
Search.
Can you take your shoes off
for me? Take your shoes off. Shoes off.
Sorry, guys, come forwards...
Okay, come on through.
Come forward for me.
You have to have a search.
Right, arms out...
No, no, no, no, no, leave your shoes.
It doesn't matter about your shoes.
Stand here.
Sir, I've still got an activation.
I'm going to have to call my supervisor.
I'm going to have to do a private search.
I'm going to have to do a private search.
Moj samolot wylatuje,
ja, ja sie spoznie, nie rozumiesz?
Moja siostra czeka, prosze...
- No, no, no.
- Ja, ja, ja musze jechac! Prosze, prosze!
You don't have to take your shirt off,
sir. You don't have to take...
Fuck!
Przepraszam.
Sorry.
I've got to search you now, sir.
No, sir, you don't have to put your arm...
Okay, sir, can you turn around?
Przepraszam.
Okay.
It's okay.
But his telly's so big, it was like having
the Sahara in the living room.
The technology they've got these days,
it's incredible.
- It's amazing.
- Oh, I know.
It's ridiculous. I've been trying to set
my laptop up with my TV for weeks now.
Well, why do you need
to set your laptop to your TV?
So my daughter
can watch all of her movies
and I've also created, like,
a little slide show...
That's nice.
..About all of her baby pictures
from birth up until now.
So, she's got, like,
the little growth process,
with, like, her little music
in the background.
It's just I bought it,
like five or six weeks ago.
It just won't recognise the device.
I don't know what the hell's going on.
Yeah, they're getting
more complicated, aren't they?
- I don't embrace technology well.
- Mm.
Have you eaten half a cake?
Yeah!
Anybody else want to have some of this
cake or am I gonna be a fat bitch?
- Don't eat carrot cake.
- Joseph, do you want some?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll have some.
I wouldn't eat that, mate.
It's toilet, that cake is toilet.
- What?
- What?!
Yep, It's absolute toilet.
- It's a pauper's cake.
- Why are you calling it toilet?
Carrot cake's a pauper's cake. It's, like,
the shittiest cake you can get, basically.
- I like it.
- Who, who's birthday is it?
- Fuck knows.
- Not me.
Fuck knows.
Please be aware
that the train doors may close
30 seconds before departure.
And that's enough
from you as well, mate.
I don't want this to escalate, please.
Sorry.
These are shitter seats than you've got.
They're walking on the top
of the O2 going,
"I think he might be talking about us,
I think I just heard something."
Putting on gloves, "Yes, I think he is."
"I'm getting some atmosphere now."
So, look.
Do you think I've lost weight?
Is that something...
Come on!
I'm so hungry!
I've got to that stage where
it's going back on and I'm in denial.
I'm lying to myself about it.
I still weigh myself.
I don't know why
I do this to myself, I'm lying to myself.
I literally, just sort of go,
"That seems fine.
"What's for breakfast?"
Fuck.
- Down here, sir.
- Step on here for me, please, sir.
Anything in your pockets?
Any sharps?
No, just my pen.
Just wait there for me, sir.
Wait there for a second.
Now, look straight ahead
and copy the diagram for me.
Take off your jewellery as well.
Place it in the tray.
Now, when my colleague calls you,
go ahead.
Sir, if you'd like
to come over here, please.
Madam, come over here, please.
- Madam...
- Oh, damn.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
If you'd like to make your way
to the gentleman
at the far end there. Please.
Anything in your pockets?
Any sharps?
Er, got... got my things...
Feet on the yellow
markings for me...
I don't... You can have them,
I don't need them.
- Um, put them in the tray.
- Can you just wait here for a bit?
- Anything else?
- Er...
- Wallet? Keys?
- Yes. Wallet. Wallet.
- On the tray.
- That's bleeding.
Face forward,
face the diagram. Excellent.
I'm going to have to search you, sir.
Is that okay?
Excellent. Like to step off
and hold that side for me.
It's you!
It's you!
- But, how are you?
- I don't know you.
Oh! Okay, okay, okay.
But how are you, seriously?
No?
- Do they, do they make you wear that?
- Sorry, sir. Thank you.
Hm?
It's... our uniform.
I'm going to have to use the wand
on you now, sir. Arms up.
The wand?
- It burns.
- It's not burning.
Yeah, eh, that burns!
That burns.
Okay, okay, okay.
Thank you.
Just wait here for a second.
- And again.
- It's not burning you.
You're getting a good reading,
though, aren't you, eh?
Excuse me, sir.
Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.
Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap.
Sir, can you keep your feet
on the markings here? Excellent.
Okay,
you can lower your arms now, sir.
- It's all right.
- Don't.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm, it, it, it's not about people,
it's about the whole fucking cosmos.
Hm? It'll be over soon.
Sir, if you'd like
to just come over there...
Don't...
- put your hands on me.
- It's all right!
God, it's...
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Now, listen, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go now.
I'm gonna... Listen, I'm gonna go now.
And you follow me in 63 seconds.
- Yeah, okay? You follow me.
- You all right, Scott?
- 63 seconds, yeah?
- Yeah, the gentleman there
in the pin-striped suit,
with the bald head.
- 42, now!
- Excuse me, sir.
Run! Come on!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- No, no, no. Ah!
- Calm down. It's okay.
- Come on! Come on!
Calm down, now. Calm down.
Come on! Come on! Come on!
No! No! Argh!
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Argh! Now!
You grabbing, er,
passenger's bollocks again, Joseph?
What are you waiting for?
- Calm down!
- You let me down!
You!
Come on!
May I have your attention, please?
Closed circuit television
and remote video monitoring is in use.
The fast train
now approaching platform one
does not stop here. Please stand
well back from the platform edge...
Oh, Dad...!
Hey!
Hey, you just hit me in the leg!
Excuse me!
- Don't beep at me.
- Dad.
- No, don't beep at me!
- Dad.
You just drove into me.
No! This is on you!
You've just driven into me!
What is wrong with you?!
Are you seriously just going to ignore me?
- Don't look at him!
- Right!
Your mate there,
he's just driven into my leg!
Dad, are you gonna...
You should not be driving!
I've got a photo of you.
Dad!
Stupid woman!
Can't drive to save her life.
I thought you were getting the 5:22.
Yeah, I missed it.
Mum?
There's no need to bellow!
You miss your train?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you call?
My phone died.
Where's he parking?
I don't know.
You get some wear
out of this shirt, do you?
Mm?
I've started moving things out the way.
Shut the door!
Too late.
That's heavy, Dad. Let me...
Get out the way!
Move, move that box.
- No, not up there, Joseph.
- Right.
Outside.
And these!
Right.
Joyce, you're in the way!
How do you expect me to...?
Bloody thing.
Wants to go... in there.
And that goes...
I've got the instructions, Dad.
You've got to remove the transit bolts.
It's the exact same set-up
- for all washing machines!
- Okay.
- I've got a wrench, Dad.
- I don't need a wrench.
It's just I thought you said
you wanted me to help you.
Well, that was your mum's idea.
Oh, bloody hell.
I suppose you had a party...
..with your friends,
on, on your actual birthday, hm?
I took a cake in to work.
It's a tradition.
So, you've, you've already had cake?
Just a carrot cake.
You swallow so loudly, Joseph.
Where'd you park?
- Dad?
- What?
Where'd you park the car?
Oh, just up on Bushmead.
Oh, no!
It was meant to be a surprise.
It'll still be a surprise.
No, it won't.
Go back in, go on!
Go on, go back in and sit down!
Well done.
It's lovely, Mum.
What have you done?!
Jo... No!
Joseph, look stay here.
Don't you get blood on the carpet!
- Come here!
- Joyce!
- Come here! Joseph!
- Joyce, come back!
- Go away and leave.
- Ah, leave him.
Open the door...
- Open the door, Joseph!
- Don't mollycoddle the boy!
Come on, let me in...
- Joseph!
- Aah!
Alan, shut up, you...
Just leave him!
I said leave him!
Open the door!
Open the door, Joseph!
- Joseph, come out of there!
- Don't shout!
You're frightening him!
Leave him!
Frightening him!
What is he, a little girl?
He's my little boy!
- Leave him alone!
- Please!
Alan! Don't go. Don't go.
Joseph, come back!
Don't go out there!
Don't go out there!
Joseph!
What's wrong with your bike?
There's nothing wrong with the bike.
Then what the fuck are you doing?
How is that your business?
You know you block the way in
when you're doing that?
And?
We've all got to fucking walk
around you to get inside.
Listen, mate,
stop fucking whingeing.
- It's anti-social.
- I don't care!
And then, I've got to listen to you
fucking revving it all night long!
And I'm tired.
Listen, just go inside
and fucking cry, right?
I'm so fucking tired!
- Hey!
- Oi!
- Fuck's sake!
- Watch what you're doing!
What am I doing?
What you're doing... come here!
You'll fucking kill me!
Oi! Fucking dick!

but you're only allowed one,

Is there anything that you don't need?
Is there anything
that you could throw away?
What's going on, Emre?
This lady's just upset she's got two bags
but it's absolutely fine.
It's all right, Joseph, you can go back.
- I'm not upset about this.

You're only allowed
one bag through.
What have you got, then?
What have you got in here?
Joseph, mate.

What you doing? What you doing?
You see that?
Jinaid, what's going on?
He just spat some blood on the floor…
Shut it down, guys.
Joseph, Joseph.
- Shut it down, please.
- Can you come over here, please?
Joseph, can you come over here, please?
Joseph, what are you playing at?
You know the rules, all right?
You don't need me to explain them
to you, right? Can you stay still?
What's happening?
What, you're laughing, are you?
Why you laughing?
- Is this funny?
- I don't fucking know.
Hey! Don't be throwing stuff.
- Woo!
- No, don't be throwing stuff.
He's spraying perfume on himself
like he's in Selfridges.
I dunno what's going on with this geezer.
- So, whose water is that?
- Some geezer.
He's had blood in his mouth, something in
his mouth and he spat it out on the floor.
- Why's it got blood in it?
- I don't know, Siobhan! I don't...
- What you doing?
- Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
- Get him down now!
- Joseph, get down.
- Have some respect for yourself, yeah?
- Joseph, do you hear me?
You're done, bruv. You're finished.
Police, police. Lane eight, now.
- Calm it down.
- Get him out, Siobhan.
- This is ridiculous!
- Get him out!
Keep on coming through, please.
Calm it down! Calm it down!
Just leave him. Leave him.
It's one stop. Might be two.
No, it's one. It's definitely..
Hey!
Oi!
I've got you on camera, mate.
Hey! You streak of piss.
- Hello?
- Oh, sorry.
Hello?
- Lily.
- Yeah?
It's Joseph.
Joseph?
What you doing here?
Yeah, I, I've come to fix your telly.
Lily?
You all right?
- This your laptop?
- Mm-hm.
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.
It come with a cable?
I don't think so.
It, it said it was Bluetooth.
Yeah. Simpler with a cable.
Should have come with one.
Seriously? For 600 fucking quid
and I can't even use it?
Better with a cable.
I'll nip out and get one.
- Uh, are you sure?
- Yeah!
Cables.
Cables.
Uh, £4.99, please.
Sorry, mate. It's not working.
Try it again?
- Nah, same again.
- Try again.
Nah,
do you want me to chip and PIN it?
It should work.
PIN in.
Nah. Card error.
There's a supermarket on the corner,
five doors down.
There's an ATM there.
Hey.
Your machine's took my card.
- Pardon?
- Your machine has taken my card.
Ah, you have to contact to your bank.
It's sucked it in.
- It's a rented machine.
- It's sucked in there.
It's a rented machine.
Nothing I can do about it.
- You got the key for there?
- Sorry. Nothing I can do.
You have to contact to your bank,
unfortunately.
- I've got to contact to the bank?
- Best way to do it.
- Best way?
- Yep.
- Have you got the key?
- No, we don't have the key.
You have to contact to the bank.
It's a rented machine.
Nothing I can about it, sir.
There's no way you can open it up?
There's no way.
Nothing I can do about it.
You have to contact
to your bank, unfortunately.
- So sorry.
- I have to go to the bank.
Just look at this first
statement for me. Yes. Yes. Junior.
That's it... down there.
Yeah, this one, here.
It actually says £40 has come out
and it was something
that I didn't authorise.
I spoke to, er, somebody at the bank.
I don't know whether...
- Yes.
- ..and I got repaid it.
Now, this has happened again.
So, can you just...
- Can I help you?
- Hey.
That machine just ate my card.
- Okay. Do you have any ID on you?
- Yeah.
Er, you don't have a passport
or driver's license?
No, I don't drive.
Er, I can't do anything for you
without any proper identification.
They just told me to contact the bank.
- Do you do online banking?
- Yeah.
- Then you can order a new card off there.
- Shall I give you my password?
- Er, no. Only you can do it.
- And my postcode?
- Only you can do it.
- I really just need £4.99 right now.
I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that.
I can give you the password
and the postcode.
I'm afraid I can't do that. Sorry, sir.
We don't accept rail cards,
only passports and driver's licenses.
Woo!
I just... I can't even...
Fuck!
Fuck!
I should fuckin'
run you over next time, mate!
Who the fuck do you think you are, huh?!
Huh?!
Look at me I'm talking to you!
Who the fuck do you think you are?!
You can't fucking walk around like that,
you dickhead!
I'm in a fucking car!
Leave it a few days to a week.
Oh, thank you.
Let us know if it doesn't go in.
- Hi, again.
- Hi.
Hurry up.
Give it to me. Now.
All of it.
- Wait, wait.
- Have you got a bag?
- Hm?
- No.
Fuck.
Hurry up.
Everything.
Is that everything?

Shit.
Thank you. Sorry.
Fuck!

Whoa. Whoa.

Yeah.
Right.
Oh, my God.
Right.
Right, and then it goes in here.
- Right. So, press this.
- Good afternoon...
- Mm-hm.
- Scroll up. Up, up, up.
Press that again, then you're there.
- Oh, brilliant.
- Right?
To get back to the telly, press this.
Then you go down.
Down, down, down, down, down.
TV, press that.
Cool.
Woo!
What the fuck are you doing?
Can I have a drink of something?
Course you can.
I got that fake cola shit.
It's disgusting, but...
Katie was lying down the floor in Tesco
screaming and shouting for it so...
- Yeah.
- I thought, "Fuck it, why not?"
Oh, fuck!
Oh!
Fuck.
Pardon me.
Are you off?
Thanks for the cola.
Thank you for fixing my TV.
You're welcome.
Hey, that pen don't work.
Oh, sorry, man. Sorry.
They're useless. Here you go.
How you doing? You all right?
- Mm-hm.
- Good stuff.
- Where you going?
- Vape.
You do know the risks
about vaping, don't you?
Such as?
Well,
it can make you look sort of stupid.
- So stupid?
- Yeah, like really stupid.
- Like, like right now.
- No, no. Not right now.
When you go out there, like...
Whatever.
- See you in a bit.
- See you.
We did that at the same time.
Is that your phone?
I thought that was my phone!
We got the same ringtone!
Sorry.
I've got a gun. Do it.
Don't fuck about.
- Quickly. Hurry up.
- All right.
Wait. Got a bag?
- I don't have a bag.
- That's a bag.
- No, but that...
- Get it.
- Do it now.
- No, it won't... It won't fit.
Well, fucking unpack it.
Unpack it.
Go on!
Come on. Hurry.
Give me all of it. Everything.
That's it. Take it.
That's it.
Hello.
Can I just post that for us.
That one. Come on.
Come on. Fuck. Come on.
- What are you doing?
- Don't move.
What are you doing?
Is he robbing you?!
Oi! Come here, now!
Oi!
Get out. What you doing?
Oi, you little prick!
Oi!
Ha. Ha.
Ha-ha!
Oh!
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Fuck!
Fuck. Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck! Hey. Hey.
How you going? Yeah? Yeah.
Hey.
- How can I help you, sir?
- You got any rooms?
Um, do you have a reservation?
- No.
- Um...
- it's very busy at the moment.
- Well, have you got anything at all?
We do have
a Superior Double available.
How many nights are you after?
Um...
a week.
Uh...
the Superior Double
is only available tonight.
I'll take it.
Okay!
- That be enough?
- One second, sir.
Place is so fucking clean!
Yeah, it's part
of our Signature Collection.
The Signature Collection?
Signature Collection?
Doors closing.
..raise your glasses, and join me.
The toast is Patrick and Sarah.
Patrick and Sarah.
Ladies and gents, put your hands
together for Hamish, the best man.
Okay. Shut up, you dicks.
Now, then.
People have been
coming up to me all night...
and asking me what precious
little nuggets about... Patrick here...
I'm going to share with you all.
Patrick!
Paddy.
Pat. Pat the twat.
And we've all got
a favourite Patrick story, I reckon,
and there's always enough to go around,
that's for fucking sure.
However... Ellie has made me promise
not to tell the one
about the time Pat shat himself
on Sarah's mum's couch...
after he had a bit of ketamine,
thinking it would help him just chill out!
That didn't work out
too well for you, mate, did it?
Um, excuse me, this is private.
It's a private function.
D'you, er...
Wow. Tough crowd.
You need to have an...
like, an invitation.
Well, I, for one, love your work,
Mrs D. At least know we know...
Uh... Shall I get security?
So, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
I won't be telling that one,
because I told I told Ellie
that I wouldn't
and you've got to listen
to your better half, haven't you?
Bit of a pearl for you, that.
You can have that.
And, you, Sarah...
you can add that to your pearl necklace.
I also think it would be
in very, very poor taste
if I was to mention
the hot intern from work.
Aw, you liked her, didn't you, mate?
- No.
- Yes, you fucking did.
- No, I didn't, mate.
- Hardly stopped talking about her!
Mind you, she was proper fit, though,
to be fair, weren't she?
Eh?
Well, relatively speaking.
No, we all, we all thought
that she was right out of your league,
but, I don't know...
must have had daddy issues.
So, no, so I won't be mentioning her.
And I certainly won't be
bringing up the time that, er...
that Sarah actively encouraged him
to bring the hot intern home...
Hello, who's this?
Hello, mate. Anybody after a Big Issue?
Ah, have you got yourself a bit of bread?
Tell you what, why don't you take
the bit of bread, go back to the buffet,
get yourself a nice bit of chicken,
or something,
and then fuck off out
back to your sleeping bag, yeah?
Seriously, could somebody take him out
before I knock him out?
Fucker... Fuck... Seriously?
Hamish, Hamish, please.
You've got about fucking five seconds
to get out of here
before I punch you in the throat.
We need this!
Erm...
Um.
I'd, er...
I'd like to propose a toast,
to, um, Patrick and Sarah.
Patrick and Sarah!
Are you going to sit down?
Oh, okay!
Um.
Er...
Good. You enjoy that. Definitely.
Yeah. It was... it was great.
I had the, the cheesecake.
You can have mine, if you want.
You can have mine.
Chuck it down, then.
I'm not standing here for my health, am I?
Fuck's sake.
All right, mate?
Here, the police are looking for you.
I told them I didn't know nowt.
What are you fucking doing?
Oi, you little shit, get here!
Oi!
Woo!
Fuck!
You all right?
Just stay there for a minute.
You stay there.
Stay there, okay?
I've gotta look at the car.
Don't worry, Mum. Mum!
Don't worry. Don't worry, all right?
Just stay there for the moment, okay?
Hey,
what the fuck have you done?!
Nothing! He came out
of fucking nowhere! I didn't see him!
Yes, you did see him!
You pulled out too quick, you dickhead!
Oh, yeah, that's right, I saw him
so I pulled out and let him crash into me.
What are you smoking, mate?
What the fuck have you done?
I haven't done anything!
Don't come near me. Fuck off.
Fuck.
- Put your phone away, all right?
- You fucking arsehole!
He came out of nowhere!
I didn't see him!
Why don't you just
fucking leave it? All right?
Oi, oi, oi, oi...
- Get your hands off me!
- How are you doing, man?
Are you all right?
Put your phone away.
Put your phone down. Don't...
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me, right?
- Stand over there!
- Seriously, man, don't move.
You don't know
what you've done to yourself.
You could have broken it.
All right. You stand there.
I'll deal with the fucking car, all right.
- Put your phone down.
- Are you okay, man?
Put your phone down!
- You're in shock.
- Oh, fuck off!
You could have...
You could have broken something, mate.
Is that why you're driving like a twat -
you're fucking drunk or something?
I'm not drunk!
I haven't drunk anything.
- I've got an elderly mother...
- Where's John? Where's John?
- Where's John?
- It's okay. Shh.
What are you doing? Oi!
Leave her alone, all right?
Get her back in the car. All right?
Get off her! Get off her!
- Get off her...
- Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi. Ease up.
Mum, get back in the car.
Get in the car.
- Mum, get back in the car.
- I'll sit with you for a little bit.
Don't fucking slam the door in her face.
Don't tell me what to do, you prick!
- Fuck off!
- Just ease up. Ease up.
- Fucking hell!
- Leave off, man!
Ease up, man! Ease up!
Stay there.
Don't you get involved with this.
- Ease up!
- Just calm down.
It's got nothing to do with you!
Ow! Fuckin' hell.
Fuck. Oh!
Fucking laughing at, you prick?
Fuck off.
- Stop. Stop.
- Fuck off. Go away.
- Go away! Fuck off!
- Don't touch me!
- Police.
- Who you ringing?
Who you ringing? Little cunt!
It doesn't matter.
Just calm the fuck down, all right?
I don't need you
getting involved as well!
- Just calm down.
- Who you ringing?
Fucking hell!
Get off me, you creep.
Oh, fuck!
What's wrong with you?
Fuckin' hell! Argh, fuck!
Fuck off.
Shit!
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Eh?
What are you doing?
What you laughing at?
You fuckin' weirdo!
I'll see you later!
Yeah. Fuck off, you nutcase!
You wanna get some help, mate.
Yeah. Yeah. Ha, ha.
Beep, beep.
Mmm.
You know, I think of you...
..first thing when I wake up.
Every day since...
before you were born.
I go...
.."Just keep him safe."
"That's all."
Don't you dare smile.
Not when you let someone
do this to you!
It's okay, Mum.
What, you think this is okay?
It's... just...
It's not important.
Well, it is to me!
It's everything to me!
This is not what...
..a... This is not what a good life
looks like, Joseph.
But I feel so good, Mum.
What does that mean?
I don't understand, Joseph.
Please, tell me. I don't...
The police said you had a gun.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
I thought we'd get a call
telling us you'd shot yourself.
Every time the phone rang.
It's okay, Dad.
I'm good.
You've ruined our lives.
You know that?
He hasn't ruined mine!
You haven't.
You're my sun...
..and moon.
You don't have to...
Dad.
You were laughing in your sleep.
You did that when you was a baby.
And I'd go...
"What's going on in that head?"
What's so funny?
Is Dad phoning the police?
Silly man.
Silly sausage.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...
Is that your back?
Yeah.
It always does that.
I'll see you soon, okay?
Okay.
- All right, there, fella?
- Hey.
That's all right, mate.
Yeah. Pound, please.
Thank you very much.
Look after yourself, yeah?
Cashier number four, please.
Cashier number six, please.
Hey.
Hi.
Do it.
That's enough.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me? That's enough.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
