- Hi
- Hi
- You brought what I asked?
- Of course.
The gun is in the pocket with the electronic
keys and the numbers of the double rooms.
Try not to loose the keys, I need to return them.
I propose we act on Saturday since,
after the ball, everyone is tired and most
employees are in vacations during week-end.
- And the shampoo?
- I forgot. I'll bring two bottles next time.
Do you know how fantastic you are?
Please take a note for the shampoo so you don't forget.
- I need to tell you something.
- What?
This is my last mission. I can't do it anymore. I can't
support living in that horrible mansion with that fat
dentist. He keeps asking if I flossed. He makes me clean
my teeth after every meal, no matter how small it was.
After the big night we're setting up, you
can come and live with us. I'll find another
mole. I don't think I'll ever find someone as
efficient as you but I need to respect your will.
Be patient a few more days and don't
forget to take your birth control pill. Ok?
- Thanks
- No, thank you. You were fantastic.
- It stops there. There's notes at the back but
I don't think it's important. - Read the notes.
- Where did you find that?
- By the river.
- Give it to me, I'll take care of it.
