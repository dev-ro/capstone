[Man]
Oh, there it went again.
It's a little pig... with wings.
* Whenever I'm with him *
*Something inside *
*Starts to burning *

* Could it be
a devil in me *
* Or is this the way
love's supposed to be *
*It's like a heat wave *
*Burning in my heart *
*Like a heat wave *
*I can't keep from crying *
*Like a heat wave *
*It's tearing me apart *
* Whenever he
calls my name *
*Soft, low

*Right then *
*I feel that
burning flame *

[Cheering]
[Motor Rewing]
[Milner]
Hey, hey, hey.
- You're looking good, Roger.
- I'm gonna beat you today, Milner.
I'd like to see you win once,
especially since this is
gonna be your last chance.
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm gonna be riding
with the Factory from now on.
The big time, but don't
let that upset you.
It might throw your timing off.
[Man On Radio] You got
the Wolfman Jack show, baby.!
Gonna get it all together.
We have four here.
Can you dig it?
Martha and the Vandellas
on the last day of the year 1964.
Do you have my wallet?
Twelve dollars?
[Laurie]
I thought you got it
off the dresser.
No, I don't.
Laurie, I got it.
No, it's all right.
No sweat.
Forget it.
We're gonna be late.
You're driving without
your license?
I thought I had it.
[Cheering]
[Revving Engine]
*Moon river

[Announcer]
Beckwith beats Milner.
He held the whole shot.
[Debbie]
Come on. Let's go.
We're late.
You all right?
We have
Hawaiian Punch.
It'll just
take a second.
Give it to me.
No sweat.
[Chuckles]
[Beckwith]
Whoo, goddamn.
I kicked your ass,
didn't I? Huh?
First time too.
I got you good.
Beat it, man.
What? Hey.
What happened anyway?
I came out of the hole fast.
Had some wheels shake.
Oh, yeah?
I think the Factory guys are
coming after the wrong man.
[Man]
Hey, Beckwith.
Hey.
You see me
wipe him out?
Hey, John.
John.
Hey, the gang's all here.
All right. Hi.
Hi.
How's it going?
Well,
I lost the race.
You lost?
Man, you never lost.
It's no big deal.
It was a preliminary run anyway.
Oh, good.
Laurie, you're looking
prettier than ever.
I look fat.
Uh-uh.
Just a little chunky.
Doctor says
it might be twins.
Really?
That's right.
Got my orders.
Yeah?
Leaving tonight.
Where to?
[Laurie]
Vietnam.
That's right.
Uncle Sam says,
"I need the Toad.
Only way we're gonna
win this one,
get the Toad in there."
Gonna go kick ass, huh?
Kick ass, take names and
eat Cong for breakfast.
*Fighting soldiers

*Fearless men

Baby, I'm coming home.
*Silver wings

* These are men
America's best *
* One hundred men

*But only three

Typical! Typical!
Guns don't work.
Nothing works.
Sniper! Sniper!
Oh, beautiful.
It's me, you idiots.
Cease fire.
Cease firing!
Oh, great.
Oh, terrific!
Keep down, sir.
We can't afford to lose
a United States congressman.
Red Two,
gimme that on call.
Fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your...
Jesus Christ!
What's going on?
Keep down, sir.
Red Two, gimme that on call.
Keep down, sir.
It's me out here!
What are you doing?
Knock it off!
Whoa!
Cease fire!
Break, break.
Red One, fire on Blue.
Keep back, Congressman.
Keep back!
Will you find me...
[Pilot]
Roger. Six commencing dive now.
* When I look
out my window *
*Many sights to see *
*And when I look
in my window *
You know,
New Year's is really
depressing for me.
It's really weird, but I have
lost two friends...
on New Year's Eve.
Last year it was this
old boyfriend, Terry.
He was really sweet.
He wanted to get
married to me.
Guess what?
What?
Murph and Nance
got married.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm. In Golden Gate Park
on the 24th.
It was really groovy.
Acid in the punch?
I don't know.
You know what?
I've been thinking, Lance.
What?
I was thinking we could
have something like that.
Acid?
No.! A ceremony
like that.
- Like what?
- Like marriage.
We could have it on
the top of Mt. Tam
at sunset,
which would be groovy
for a Gemini and Libra.
We could write
our own ceremony.
Dave Freeland got
his papers from the
Universal Life Church.
So he could say the words.
I could wear that
white antique velvet
dress that I have, and...
What do you think?
Wow!
[Siren]
Oh, Jesus, a cop.
Ow!
Swallow this.
Pull over.
Uh, yes, sir.
Pull over there.
Can't find a place.
Pull over.
Chew on this.
Stop!
We're trying to.
What do you want me to do?
Stop in the middle of the road?
Don't you have respect
for the law?
Keep going.
What kind of
officer are you?
What's he eating?
What's in
your mouth?
Nothing.
Pull over or I'll
shoot that tire.
Go ahead.
Why don't
you shoot me?
Stop!
Kill maybe three, four
innocent people. Go ahead.
Go! Go!
It's cool.
Roll the window down.
Sorry to disappoint you,
but we're on the natch.
Oh, yeah?
What do we got here?
Looks like
a narcotics substance to me.
It's one lousy joint.
You're under arrest, friend.
Ah! Come on, man!
You got nothing better to do
than hassle longhairs?
It's my life, friend.
I love my work.
Take down
his number.
Make it easy for you, lady.
It's 54362.
Name is Officer Falfa.
F-A-L-F-A.
I'm telling ya, Lance,
we gotta get outta this city.
We gotta get married
and get outta this city.
For sure.
You do?
You do want
to get married?
Bail me out, huh?
We'll talk about it.
[Wolfman Jack]
This is a great tune
for the last day of 1967.
Percy Sledge,
"When a Man Loves a Woman."
* When a man
loves a woman *
Ow.
* Can't keep his mind
on nothin'else *
Feel better now?
Wanna act like an
idiot? Terrific.
[Steve]
I got something you're
gonna like to break.
Take this.
This is real expensive.
Break that.
Goddamn it! What are you, crazy?
That's your mother's wedding present.
What are you
gonna tell her?
Maybe you'll explain to her.
Are you guys having a fight?
Hey, kiddo. No.
No, Mom and I aren't fighting.
We're having
an adult conversation.
- I heard something break.
- Yes, Mommy broke a glass.
That's all, sweetheart.
Say, isn't it time for Mr. Rogers?
Why don't you and your
brother watch Mr. Rogers.
Take Duckers and go on,
Mark.
Selling insurance
is tough work, Laurie.
I work my butt off.
I'm not gonna stand around
and have you all of a sudden
decide that you...
I don't wanna watch Mr. Rogers.
I wanna watch cartoons.
Then watch cartoons, sweetheart,
but let Mommy and Daddy talk. Okay?
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying, honey.
I've been peeling onions.
Now, go on.
- I hate onions.
- I know, sweetheart. Go on.
What about them,
huh?
I'm not gonna stand for it.
I'm not gonna have my kid
brought up by baby-sitters.
It's just three hours a day
in a nursery school.
It'd be so good for them.
The best thing
is their mother.
I want to be
more than a mother!
You are.
You're a wife.
[Screaming]
I can't believe you.
You gonna hit
me with that?
I wanna get a job.
I wanna go to work!
We need the money!
You're pissing me off.
It's three hours a day
in Dr. Martin's office.
It's not three hours
anywhere. It's here,
taking care of your kids.
MaryJo works.
That's the bottom line.
End of the conversation.
Not another word.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
My brother's.
Curt's?
Curt's in Canada.
Andy's at school.
- What about our New Year's party?
- Can I go to work?
- Absolutely not.
- Then screw the New Year's party!
[Wolfman Jack]
You got the Wolfman Jack show...
on the last day of the year 1964.
*Hey la, hey, la
my boyfriend's back *
* When you see him comin'
better cut out on the double *
Have you ever seen
anything like that?
Milner, here's your car.
Hope it fits my ass.
You're gonna look great
sitting behind that.
I'm gonna look
great beside it at
the winner's circle too.
You can't even beat me.
I don't know what
they want with you.
Hey, Mr. Hunt,
here's your new driver.
New driver?
Milner.
How are you, sir?
Oh, John Milner, right.
Come with me, will ya?
What did you think
of those radio spots?
The station thought up
that Madman business...
John the Madman Milner.
Hope you don't mind.
The reason I wrote you
the letter was...
I need you to sign
a release for the ad.
Sit down.
You know, giving us
permission to use your name.
There's a $20 honorarium.
Just give me your signature.
What's wrong?
It's just a simple release.
Your letter said you wanted
to welcome me onto
the Hunt Brothers racing team.
Yeah.
Everybody knows you're
looking for a new driver.
Oh, no, that's
a figure of speech.
You were in the ad,
so you're on the team, okay?
That's bullshit. I mean...
You didn't think we were
gonna hire you to race?
Why not? I'm the best out here.
Come on. These are
just hobby races.
This is a whole
different league.
Look, I can beat anybody
off the line, and that includes
this clown you've got driving.
I just turned 190.77
in a car I built myself.
Give me your signature,
champ.
I'll tell you what.
I'm not gonna sign it,
but why don't you
light it on fire
and stick it up your ass?
What's the matter
with him?
Hey, John. What's...
Relax, kid. Win a few races
and then come back.
[Beckwith]
Yeah, John,
just win a few races.
Look, buddy.
We'll see about that.
I'm gonna beat you today.
You're gonna
cream those guys.
Yeah.
John, we're gonna have to
get him back to the base.
Sure you don't
want to come along?
I'd like to, Steve.
But I got some races to win.
I gotta beat the Factory.
Hey, uh, look.
I want you to keep this.
Take that with you.
That's from when
my flywheel blew up.
Remember?
Hey, that's great.
Man, that's really great.
Hell, you know what
I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna capture you
a V.C. Flag.
Nah, don't do that, man.
Just come back alive.
*Stop in the name oflove *
*Before you break my heart *
Mess with the bull,
you get the horn.
Nobody could survive
an hour of that.
Hold on. I think there's
another one out there, sir.
Hey, man, that's Fields.
All right.
- What are you doing out there?
- Fields?
Fields?
Who's Fields?
He's one of ours, sir.
American soldiers have
a knack for survival, sir.
Ah, yeah.
Well, let's go meet the boy.
What the hell were
you doing out there?
Well, sir.
I don't know, sir.
I was just kinda cleaning my rifle.
It sort of went off.
These guys must have
thought I was V.C.
Charlie wasn't
out there?
Uh, no, sir.
And you...
Major.
You say you saw about
a dozen of the enemy.
Uh... Yes, sir.
How about
the body count?
Tell the congressman here
about the body count.
Oh, the best.
Absolutely the best.
There were guts
and pieces all over
the place.
How many
would you say?
Oh, heck, I don't know.
You'd have to count up
all the arms and legs.
I'd say two dozen, maybe.
Two dozen?
That's very good, Fields.
Yes, excellent.
Good work, son.
Thank you, sir.
I'd better be getting
over to the dispensary.
The dispensary?
Yes, sir. The little people
put up a hell of a fight.
I sustained a wound.
Where?
Oh, nothing serious, sir.
I'll be fine after a few days
of bed rest back in the rear.
Let me see it.
Excuse me.
That doesn't look too bad.
There's always
the danger of infection.
It's better to be safe
than sorry.
You go have a medic
look at it, Fields.
Then report
to your unit.
Yes, sir.
Son of a bitch.
What did you say,
Major?
I said, it's sort
of a beach.
We levelled it.
Hell of a job, men.
One hell of a job.
Let's have a drink.
Hey, everybody.
Emergency.
Emergency! Lance just
got busted again.
I'm $25 short
to meet bail.
Does anybody
have any money?
Outta luck.
If I get a couple of
bucks from each of you,
we could bail him out.
Ed, you know he'd help you.
He owes me $50.
We just can't let him sit in there.
It's New Year's Eve.
Let him rot.
I want you to know that I think
this behavior is really crappy.
When it comes time to do any favors,
I'm gonna remember this.
Come on, Debbie.
I don't blame them.
Lance is a flake.
Rainbow, I don't appreciate
that kind of talk.
Besides, Lance and I are
thinking about getting married.
Married? What?
[Debbie]
Lance has bread stashed
in here somewhere.
Damn it.! Where is
the light switch?
[Rainbow]
Try the panel.
You can't marry him.
You're gonna end up supporting
him the rest of your life.
I don't mind helping
Lance out, and I don't see
why it should bother you.
[Rainbow]
I happen to think working
as a topless dancer is creepy.
Maybe that's your hang-up
if you think the human body's creepy.
Besides,
the money's great.
If the money's so great,
why don't you have the 25 bucks?
[Debbie]
Good idea. I'll get
an advance from my boss.
[Crying]
So Steve doesn't want
you to get a job. Big deal.
Go home and
work it out.
I can't, Andy.
Please let me stay here.
Please, Andrew?
No, go to Mom and Dad's
or one of your dopey girlfriend's.
[Laurie]
No, please, I can't do that.
I won't get in your way.
I promise, Andy.
And maybe I could
straighten up this place.
No, thanks. No, thanks.
I like this place just the way it is.
You like living
in squalor?
He loves it.
[Andy]
Yeah, I love it.
Every little piece of trash
and rancid dirt.
Now, go home.
I was getting ready to leave.
You know what I think?
Mother and Daddy made
a big mistake letting
you come to this school.
Yeah, well, you made a bigger mistake
getting married when you did.
I didn't have to get married!
I didn't have to get married!
She didn't have to get married.
The twins just arrived a little early.
Oh, that's funny.
That's real funny, Andy.
Thanks a lot.
Here, finished.
What do you think?
That's lovely.
That's... That's lovely.
You're missing
the point.
We have to communicate
in a vernacular that
the police will understand.
"Pigs eat shit"?
"Pigs eat shit" does not make
an understanding police officer.
You're gonna be
in big trouble.
What happened to that sweet
little boy you used to be, huh?
Remember how I used to tease you
and tie ribbons in your hair?
Stop it.
What's happened
to your hair? Look at that.
Andy, come on.
Buck up, kid.
You all right?
Yeah, thanks.
I'll just clean up the place
a little bit. It'll make me feel
a whole lot better.
Don't you dare.
[Andy]
I better find every piece of crap
exactly where I left it.
[Wolfman Jack]
Holy smokes, the Marvelettes.
* Oh baby *
[Wolfman Jack]
Oh, baby, I love it.
*Hey hey hey *
Hi, John.
Whatcha doin'?
Is that nitro?
God! At least you can say hi.
You don't have to take
it out on the whole world...
for what happened
with the Factory.
Get hosed, will ya?
You can't believe the
date I had last night.
You know, Earl with
the yellow 'Vette?
Talk about crude.
This guy is an animal.
I can't believe...
- Hey, hey!
- Oh, God... I'm sorry.
Hey, Carlos, check out
my new formula.
80% nitro,
20% Chee-tos.
I'm sorry.
Listen, will you do us a favor
and get outta here?
Okay, if that's the way
you feel, maybe I will.
Come on, Eva, let's
bug this pop stand.
Hey, hold it.
Hold it. Um...
I'm John Milner,
the owner/driver
of this car here.
This is our team T-shirt.
I'd be deeply honored
if you wore it.
I don't do this every day.
The thing cost $3.75. Here.
Nice, huh?
She's a foreigner, John.
She doesn't understand a word.
It's just as if
she was deaf and dumb.
Huh?
[Icelandic]
[Continues In Icelandic]
See what I'm talking about?
I don't know what she's
yapping about either.
What are you doing
with her?
My dad. It's this
foreign exchange program...
with his Rotary Club
or something.
At least she's
only gonna be here a week.
[Icelandic]
My last shirt too.
[Wolfman Jack]
Now we're gonna do the weather
for all the valleys.
About 200 degrees in Merced,
400 degrees in Fresno.
* When I woke up
this morning *
All right.
My name is Bob Sinclair.
I think of myself
as tough but fair.
Bob Sinclair, tough, but fair.
Hey, you know, that rhymes.
As I was saying,
I'm tough, but I'm fair.
We're gonna run a tight ship,
a ship we can be proud of.
I like a proud crew.
Proud of what they're doing,
proud of each other...
and proud of the
war they're fighting.
A proud crew is
a professional crew.
[Raspberry]
Who did that?
A rat smells his
own cheese first.
Sorry, sir, but during war
a soldier gets gas
on his stomach.
What's your name?
My name? Oh.
They call meJoe the Pharaoh.
See, back home,
I was a low rider.
What's your name?
Terry the Toad.
We're from the same town.
Sir, if I could
tell you some stories...
I asked him his name.
Terry Fields. Sir, I don't
want to disappoint you,
but you got yourself in
with a couple of cowards here.
We like things
safe and easy.
Understand?
I am disappointed, but maybe
pride will change attitudes.
Now, since this is my first day
as your new aircraft commander,
I wanted to make it a great day,
so I volunteered us for medivac duty.
You volunteered?
That's right!
Now, listen up.
Shit!
Every time
we go out on a mission...
I'm gonna put a little American flag
sticker right here on this door.
By the time
I finish my tour...
I want this whole door and this
bulkhead covered with flags.
Volunteered!
Happy goddamn new year.
* One two three
Good lovin'*
* Good lovin'*
You want me
to lend you $25,
so you can bail out
your goofy boyfriend
who got beefed for weed?
Yeah, but, Ralph,
you can take it out
of my next paycheck.
You ought to stay
away from weed.
It's gonna lead you
into cigarettes.
- Yeah? So what about the 25?
- I wanna tell you something.
Come over here.
This is your lucky day,
and you know why?
For two reasons.
First of all,
I believe in you.
And when I believe
in someone,
I can't bear
to let 'em down,
you know what I mean?
And secondly, I'm
gonna make you...
the biggest thing
in the street.
What with? 40
pounds of silicone?
No!
I got something in here
that's gonna make you...
bigger than the topless
grandmother of six.
Think of that.
Jesus Christ!
That's a snake!
You bet it is.
I thought we'd call you
Debbie...
the topless
snake charmer.
Are you out
of your crummy mind?
I'm not offering you
a poisonous snake to handle.
They're like dogs.
They're affectionate.
- Give him a little scratch.
- When I think of that slimy thing,
you know, I could just urp.
Wait. They're not slimy.
Go ahead. Touch it. Scratch it.
Give him a touch.
God, Ralph, that's it.
I quit this gig. I quit.
I quit.
I've lost two
girls tonight.
All right.
The snake goes.
I'll never mention it again
and I'll give you the loan.
Will you
make it a gift?
A gift?
You crazy?
All right,
I'll make it a gift.
I'll make it a gift.
Boy, you artists,
you're so touchy.
Fido?
Fido? Jesus, I've lost
a rented snake.
Fido? [Whistles]
I can't lose a rented snake.
Ah, yeah.
Aaah!
God Almighty!
Jesus, where'd
that come from?
That's my snake.
I rented that snake.
I'll have to put
that on your tab.
Eat your food, Mark.
Don't play with it.
I'm gonna puke.
And don't say puke, okay?
Say throw up.
[Mark]
That's what I'm gonna do.
Puke.
I hate this.
Where's Mommy?
She went shopping.
Sure. Bet!
Eat your food.
I made it myself.
It's better for you than that crap.
- Bull!
- What did you just say?
Bull.
[Phone Ringing]
Shit.
[Doorbell Rings,
Phone Ringing]
Come on in.
The door's open.
Hello? Yeah, MaryJo.
A recipe? I don't know...
[Man]
Where do you want this?
Just a second. That's not supposed
to get here until tonight.
Didn't my wife tell you that?
We were told now.
Where do you want it?
Jesus!
It's gonna melt!
I told you I was turning
this off if you didn't eat.
- [Screams]
- Aw, come on.
- Look at that.
- There's another one.
I can't talk right now.
She's not here.
I'll see you tonight.
- You fart!
- Where do we put this?
It ain't feathers, you know.
[Steve]
I don't care.
Find a place and put it down.
This ain't gonna work.
[Steve]
Get your feet out of
the fish tank, Michael.
Get 'em out right now.
Laurie,
get this straight.
I am a man. You understand that?
And a man has a certain role in life.
And a man goes to work
and earns money for his family.
And a man is a man,
not a housewife.
A woman is a housewife,
and we're having a party tonight.
And my mother loved being
a housewife, and my mother
loved being a mother.
And I'm coming to pick you up now.
Understand that? Answer me!
[Ringing]
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.
And another thing...
All you care about is...
It's me. Andy.
Oh, hi, Andy.
I need my wallet.
Your wallet?
Why?
Because it's an emergency.
Tell her you need
your driver's license.
- I need my driver's license.
- Why?
Because you're staying
without my permission and you can
damn well bring me my wallet.
All right. Okay.
Boy, you have a mean streak.
Where'd you put it?
It's in my sweatshirt
hanging in the corner
of the kitchen.
Okay. Oh, by the way,
I cleaned the apartment just a ta...
[Line Clicks]
Hello?
[Ringing]
Go to hell,
you son of a bitch.
[Motors Revving]
[People Screaming]
[Icelandic]
Ah, he's all right.
Teensa? Teensa!
[Iceland]
Hey, don't worry about her.
She'll be back.
She's got an attention span
of about 15 seconds.
[Icelandic]
Don't worry.
[Man Over P.A.]
The thing we always dread has happened.
[Beckwith]
Looky here,
it's the Milner crew.
Getting after it,
aren't we?
Yeah, John, I really
feel bad about the way
everybody's laughing at you.
I mean, I think
it's a damn shame.
First, I wipe you out, and after
the bragging you been doing...
them Hunt Brothers,
they shut you down.
Hell, a guy like you
deserves more respect.
You're practically
a legend.
Who is this beauty queen?
Leave her alone.
She's Swedish or something.
She doesn't speak English.
Great, I parlez-vous
German myself.
Oh, yeah.
Really, I do.
Hello.
Hello.
[Speaking German]
[German]
Her name's Eva, John,
in case you didn't know.
Eva, listen.
[Gibberish German]
- What are you saying to her?
- I told her she had a beautiful body.
I asked her if she'd like
to make it with me.
Get outta here.
She said she would.
Something about a motel
I didn't quite pick up, here.
Let's see.
[Gibberish]
[Gibberish]
See, John, this
chick's hot for me.
Get outta here.
What do you say, baby?
How about giving a bit of that
free love you got in Sweden?
Hey, Rog. Hey-hey-hey!
That's enough.
What? Look, man,
I'm sorry.
I was kidding.
It's not funny.
Take a hike, huh?
I was playing with you.
Sure, John. Sure.
See you later, baby.
[Icelandic]
I don't know.
[Wolfman Jack]
Rubbing your soul
with a little rock 'n'roll.
* Well, no one
told me about her *
[Joe]
Look at flag ass.
He's actually enjoying
this crap.
He's too stupid
to be scared.
[Man Over Radio]
Two-six, come in, over.
Red Cap Three, is the L-Z hot?
They're moving in on us.
Get that goddamn machine in here.
- Hey, get over the trees.
- Don't tell me how to fly
my ship, soldier.
We're a target in the clear area.
Get over the trees!
[Gunfire]
- We're hit.!
- Where?
Get over the trees!
Shit!
This is Red Cap Three.
I've got you visual.
I'm throwing smoke... now!
[Man Over Radio]
Bulldog, you're heading straight for us.
Can you see the smoke?
That's a Roger.
Get your heads down.
Bulldog's coming in.
That's a "rog," Bulldog. Over.
Joe, get the wounded to the L-Z.
Stay close to the trees.
[Man Over Radio] Bulldog.!
We're moving wounded into
the open. Charlie's moving in.
All right, Young,
open up.
* Well, let me tell you
'bout the way she looks
the way she acts *
*And the color ofher hair *
*Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright *
*But she's not there *
[Man Over Radio]
We're gonna make our dive.
Here we go.
[Sinclair]
Get 'em on board!
[Terry]
Get in, goddamn it.!
Hurry up.!
[Screaming]
Get him in here!
Go ahead, lift off, man!
Lift off!
[Moaning, Screaming]
Take it easy, man!
Oh, my God.
Don't worry.
You don't get
used to it.
[Gurgling]
Whoo!
Hey!
Hey!
Thanks for bailing
me out, honey.
It's all right!
So... So, how much was bail?
$212.00
Wow. You're great.
You know that?
You love me?
Does Raggedy Ann have
cotton tits or what?
Have you been thinking about
what we were talking about?
About
getting married?
Sorta.
What do you think?
Whoa!
Don't worry,
it's dead.
- Slick Eddy killed him.
- What the hell you got him for?
You know how Rainbow's
always stealing towels.
I thought I'd put it on the top shelf,
and then when she takes a towel off
it'd fall on her head.
What do you think
about getting married?
Make a good hood ornament.
Don't you think it would
strengthen our relationship?
Feel this lump.
I think it ate a rat.
- You're pregnant.
- I'm in love.
So am I, baby,
but, uh...
What does a piece of paper
mean anyway, you know?
It's so middle-class.
We gotta keep this thing
free and open...
and groovy, you know?
Come on. Get in.
Contact.
Contact.
Listen to him.
Don't you think he's a genius?
[Rainbow]
Mm-hmm.
Come on. He's really great.
How come he's not
getting any gigs?
It's all in who you know.
You think MickJagger
was always rich?
So, who was
on the phone, hon?
Bad news.
Good news sorta.
Bryan got sick
and asked if I could
take his pizza route.
Lance, it's New Year's Eve.
You're not gonna do it, are ya?
Look, I feel lousy about
your paying my bail.
I gotta pay you back.
But we're gonna go
to the Fillmore.
There's six bands
and everything.
Go with Rainbow.
Electric Haze is gonna be there.
It's your favorite group.
What can I do?
We need
the bucks.
That's for sure.
[Screaming]
A snake! It bit me!
Bit her.
**[Rock, Indistinct]
So, uh, how long has
this demonstration
been going on?
Since just before the vacation.
But I think they're ready to kick us out.
Good. Good.
You got my
sweatshirt on.
It was cold out.
So I borrowed it.
Do you mind?
No, but have you seen
what's on the back?
What?
Oh, that's great.
What is it? What is it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Vikki, this is my sister, Laurie.
Vikki Townsend.
Hi.
Hi, nice to meet you.
That's really a cute outfit
you got there.
I, um... I used to be a cheerleader
myself in high school... varsity.
Well, I'm not a cheerleader
anymore, exactly.
I used to be, but now
I'm a cheerleader for peace.
That's my baby.
Why don't you do
one of your cheers for her.
Right now?
Oh, yeah. Come on.
She looks like she'd be really good.
Murder, murder every day.
Hey, you generals,
what do you say?
Drop your Napalm,
drop your gas.
And suck it all
right up your ass.
Yea, peace.!
Yea, peace.!
She's got a million of'em.
Wait till you hear "Kill
a Commie for your mommy."
Did you
bring my wallet?
[Vikki]
I'm gonna do that when
Andy burns his draft card.
You're not gonna
burn your draft card.
Laurie, don't hassle me.
That would never have brought
your wallet down here.
It's against the law.
No, absolutely not.
You could go to jail.
Hey, guys. Look who's here.
It's Madman Milner.
Hey, why don't you put
that little Chevy back
in your street car, pal?
[Laughing]
Hey, you wanna go get
something to eat?
You know, go over
to the snack bar?
[Icelandic]
Yeah, come on.
So, you're from
Sweden, huh?
So, uh, you know
Anita Ekberg?
Anita Ekberg?
Hey, yeah.
How about, uh...
What's that car?
Volvo?
Volvo?
Yeah, they got
Volvos in Sweden.
You must be from
Sweden, huh?
[Icelandic]
Huh?
"Eastland"? I don't
know where that is.
[Icelandic]
North Pole? You from
the North Pole?
[Icelandic]
Eskimos and a bunch
of ice up there.
Whatever you say. I was...
Hey, it's the little twerp.
Don't "little twerp" me, John.
I've grown.
- A little bit.
- John, this is Perry.
Hi, there, Perry.
Hello, John.
How do you
like the drags?
I don't know much about cars.
I'm from New York.
Huh.
Why don't you introduce me
to your friend.
Well, this is my friend.
She, uh, is from, uh,
another country.
She's foreign.
She doesn't speak English.
Hi.
Hi.
Comes from the North Pole.
Raised by Eskimos.
Oh, well, you two must have
some real stimulating conversations.
Well, you know, there are
a few conversations you're
too young to know about.
I'm older than you think, John.
[Perry]
We're gonna be late.
Oh. Yeah, we gotta get going.
Perry's taking me
to a coffee house.
Coffee house?
Well, okay. Listen.
I want you to
take care of yourself
and be good, okay?
Bye, John.
What I want to know is,
how do these Eskimos make love?

Are you crazier than hell?
He'll break you in half.
He'll be on your ass
like a June bug on shit.
No sweat, man. I can handle him.
Break.
Your wife is a cow.
Your mother is a hog.
- You're dumb and ugly.
- I'm gonna kill you.
Ow!
- What's the matter?
- Oh, my knee.
Holy shit.
Some guys
got all the luck.
Luck? He just
broke his leg.
It's his
ticket home, yo-yo.
You don't mean
you want to get hurt?
Pal, in case you haven't
figured it out yet,
they're trying to get us
killed in this war, man.
I'm gonna get
outta here.
You ever try
shooting yourself?
I told you, sir,
I was just
cleaning my rifle.
That's not the
scuttlebutt I get.
Honest, sir,
it was just an accident.
Let's hope you don't have
any more accidents, Fields.
In the meantime,
how does latrine duty
sound to you?
About a month
of it.
You're kidding!
Starting now!
Get moving!
Let's go take a shit.
Terrific.
Just terrific.
Fields!
Fields!
Hold that salute till
I return it, soldier.
Move out!
You're playing like candy asses.
Let's hit somebody.

Fecal waste shall
be moved a distance...
not less than 50 meters from
the mess hall or living area.
Diesel fuel shall be added to
the waste matter and ignited.
When the drum is cooled,
it shall be replaced. Understand?
No.
What part
don't you understand?
Start at
the beginning.
- Toad, don't give me that crap.
- Don't give me this crap.
You get to it or I'll
be talking to the major.
This is his personal favorite shithouse.
You understand?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Flies Buzzing]
[Radio]
This doesn't help the problem.
Out of sight, out of mind?
It gets worse instead ofbetter.
You may be setting yourself up...
for permanent physical damage,
like insanity.
There are several types
of venereal disease...
and each requires
special medication.
For prescription
drugs, remember,
obtain them only from
qualified medical authorities.
Venereal disease isn't exactly
something to be proud of,
but it is something you
should never try to cover up.
I'll walk.
I'll get right out of here
and keep walking till I get home.
I know I could do it.
Just get past the MPs.
[Man On Radio]
After a break from
the news and weather,
we'll be back with

How do you think
I scored BobbyJordan?
[Rainbow]
I heard he left the group.
They're looking for
a new guitar player.
Maybe Lance could get that gig.
Forget it, Debbie.
There's no harm in asking.
You'll introduce me, won't you?
Sure,
I'll introduce you.
Oh, hey, what's the matter?
[No Audible Dialogue]
Come on, Debbie. This may be
the big break in Lance's career.

Wow, look at them!
* Now, I'm a man
That's spelled M *
Wow, who
do I talk to?
Oh, Felix.
Do you know who that is?
He's only the bass player
for the Strawberry Prunes.
Talk about cute.
Dibs.
Hello, my beautiful one.
I hold before you
my magic satchel...
containing 2,000 mikes
of pure Owsley sunshine.
What do you say?
Beat it, bozo.
**[Continues]
Eric Benson,
and I ain't going.
Andy, you don't think
we'd be in Vietnam...
unless the president
knew a few things
we don't know, huh?
Not so loud.
You're embarrassing me.
I don't see what's so
embarrassing about saying
you support the president.
Because somebody might hear you.
We elected him.
We should stand by him.
If we give these
Communists an inch,
they're gonna take a mile.
Today it's Vietnam.
Tomorrow it could be here.
In our very own
backyard.
She's drunk.
Attention. This is
SergeantJames Dutton speaking.
I don't understand you, Andy.
I really don't understand you.
Let go of it.
[Vikki]
Go on, Andy.
You're an idiot, Andrew.
You're an idiot.
My name is
Andy Henderson.
I'd like to dedicate this
to the police outside.
There it is.
You are ordered to evacuate
the building immediately.
Hi. I'm looking
for Andy Henderson.
He lives next door.
Do you know where he went?
You got a warrant?
A warrant? No.
I'm not talkin'to you.
Wait. Why would
I need a warrant?
You got
"narc" written over you.
I'm not a narc. L...
Actually, I'm an insurance agent.
I'm looking for my wife.
He's with my wife.
Uh-huh. Sure.
An insurance agent.
And Andy's shtupping your
old lady. It's a good try,
but it ain't gonna work.
Hold it. Please.
You got it all wrong.
I'm not a narc.
In my book,
insurance agent and narc
are the same thing: Pigs!
And if I were you, I'd truck
my oinking Wonder Bread self
right on outta here.
You're right.
About what?
You're under arrest, asshole.
Hit the wall!
- Where are they?
- Don't be doing that!
Where are they?
On campus, man. Demonstration.
- Is that all you know?
- Honest, man.
- I'll tell you where I buy my weed.
- He's gone.

It's Alan Billy.
The Hunt Brothers there
first by a mile.
He smeared him.
Go tellJohn.
Yeah.
* When you just give love

Hey, you want a beer?
A beer? Hmm.
[Icelandic]
[Mumbles]
Here.
[Icelandic]
Yeah, right. That's one of
the things I like about you.
You're real easy
to talk to.
Yes, that's
very good.
Yeah?
Well, what do you say I, uh,
move a little closer to you.
You know what I mean?
Just a little bit.
Yeah, that's right.
John, the Hunt Brothers
beat Alan Billy with a 7-82.
Hey, have you ever
heard of knocking, man?
Oh, sorry. I didn't
see you were busy.
I'm not busy, but I'm trying
to get busy. All right?
Okay.
Now, where was I? Uh...
The North Pole, yes.
The North Pole...
and "Eastland" and Volvo.
And Mickey "Moose"?
[Chuckles]
That's right. Um...
You know,
you really are beautiful.
[Icelandic]
Right, that's...
that's right.
[Icelandic]
That's what I was thinking.
You're turning me on.
Right?
[Icelandic]
Well, l...
You know, this conversation
is getting us nowhere.
I think that I'll just try
the physical approach, okay?
You think?
The physical approach, you know,
like getting to first base.
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?
[Icelandic]
Oh, now, now, now,
now, now, now, now.
Just relax.
[Icelandic]
Hey, now, wait a minute.
You came into my camper.
What do you think
I'm gonna do?
[Icelandic]
Hey, come back here.!
Hey, come on back.

Hey, Toad, wake up, will ya?
What planet you on?
Just thinking

New Year's Eve tonight.
So what?
Oh, it's...
kind of an anniversary.
Good buddy of mine got killed
a year ago today.
He caught one?
No. It was back in the world.
John Milner. You knew him.
Had the hottest wheels in the valley.
Good buddy of mine.
Good friend.
Hey, Toad.
I've been thinking.
I'm takin' care of you, right?
Yeah.
When we get back home,
I'm gonna make you
an honorary...
full-fledged member
of the Pharaohs.
No blood initiation,
nothing like that.
Me, you and Ed,
we're gonna open up
a used car lot.
You sell 'em,
we steal 'em.
The flying Pharaohs.
[Man Over Radio]
Bulldog, you're two clicks
northeast of our position.
You heard 'em, Gunner.
Two clicks to the L-Z.
Get back in position.
- Red Cap One, we're goin'in.

It looks pretty hairy down here.
I don't... Watch it.!

[Gunfire]
[Man Over Radio]
Okay, Red Cap Two,

We're going in ahead of you.
Okay, cleared left and above.
- Okay, got a steep approach.
Just hang on.
- Pre-landing check complete.
All right, Young, open up.
Go down a hair!
Move out.!
Uh, Gunner,

Ow!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Get out of here! Let's go!
Oh, Jesus! Toad!
- You all right?

Oh, Jesus! Joe! Joe!
Come on, man!
Don't die on me.
Hey, we got hit.
There's fire back there.
- Come back to me, man!

I can't hold it.
He's dead, man!
He's dead.!
I can't control it!
- Hold on!
- Get off the trees! Get... Jesus!
* Yeah, come on

* Uncle Sam needs your help again *

found somebody.
[Moonflower]
Seems like she always goes
for those '50s kind of guys.
Felix?
No, I'm Newt.
Can I help you?
No, I'm looking for Felix.
That's him right there.
Hey, Felix?
Uh-huh?
She wants to talk to you, man.
Hey, how you doin'?
Hi. Hi. My name's Debbie.
I'm a friend of
Moonflower Badenbend.
Don't say no more.
I know exactly who you're talkin' about.
You're talking about
the one with the red hair, right?
No, she's got blue hair.
Well, maybe she dyed it.
Anyway, she got a ring of roses
tattooed around her arm, right?
No.
Well, this Moonflower has roses
tattooed around her arm.
She thought it looked pretty.
I thought it looked like a snake.
And, let me tell you,
snakes are not my style.
It's funny you should mention snakes.
When I was a kid, I saw a snake.
I freaked out!
But my sister,
my sister loved snakes.
Calls her old man a snake.
His name is Bill. He's a barber.
She shot him two years ago
right through the ass.
But it was cool, 'cause he's a barber.
He works standin' up,
so he didn't have to sit down on it.
I wanted to tell you
about this friend of mine
who plays really great guitar.
But long hair put Bill
right out of business.
Got so upset, got drunk,
ate his kid's hamster.
Said it tasted like a mackerel.
Who?
Lance Harris.
Never heard ofhim.
Probably a youngie.
And I'm not a youngie,
but I'm not an oldie either.
But it's tough enough.
This guy's really good.
He's likeJerry Garcia,
Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa.
He can play anything.
Lance.
What's his name?
What about him?
Well, he'd be great
for your group.
What's his name?
Lance Harrris.
I used to know a surfer named Lance.
His name was "No Pants" Lance.
Listen to me.
What? What?
What is it?
- Are you always like this?
- Like what?
Talkin'. I think
she thinks you talk a lot.
[Felix]
Hey, let me tell you somethin'.
What's wrong with talkin'?
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.
It's better I talk, 'cause I can't spell.
Excuse me.
And if I had to spell,
I would be out of luck.
[Debbie] Wait a minute.!
Wait a minute. Let me out.
[Felix]
Hey, we're moving.
I know!
So where we goin'?
I don't know.
You tell me where we're going.
We have a gig over in Oakland.
Don't worry.
You'll have fun.
With five guys?
This is your final warning.
You have one minute
to vacate the building.
[Man]
Okay, we're gonna have a vote here.
All of you that
want to chicken out,
please raise your hands.
We have one vote?
She's an outside agitator.
Doesn't count.
Don't you believe
in democracy, Andy?
Uh, with qualifications.
Well, if you want to give in,
maybe you shouldjust go.
Thank you.
Good luck. Good luck.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Andy!
[Man Continues]
We have to stand together.
They can't take us away because...
[Glass Shattering]
[Screaming, Shouting]

Oh, my... The door's locked!
Andy!
[Screaming, Shouting Continue]
Laurie, help me!
Tear gas!
Tear gas!
Andy!
Wait up, wait up!
[Announcer]
The Calhoun car
is coming up to the line.
Jimmy Calhoun's engine
is starting to warm up.
But where's Milner?
He knows better than this.
He's going to be disqualified
ifhe doesn't get up
to the line real quick.
- John, wait!
- Come here, Eva. I wanna talk to you.
Come on. Let me explain.
Will you stop? Wait!
Come here.
I'm trying to talk to you. Hold it!
Come here, come here, come here.
[Icelandic]
I know.
I know. Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm trying to apologize.
Do you understand?
Shit, how am I supposed
to talk to you?
Why can't you speak English?
I'm trying to apologize to you.
I didn't mean it.
"Pardon-moi." You understand?
"Pardon-moi."
[Icelandic]
When you came into my camper,
what'd you expect me to do?
John, come on!
We got a race.
[Milner]
Hey, come on, man.
It's the first race of the day.
- Speak to her later.
- [Icelandic]
[Revving Engine]
Give me that thing.
[Announcer]
Okay, Milner's crew now muscling
the car up to the starting line.
And listen to that hand
forJohn Milner.
He's had a bit ofbad luck today,
but apparently the fans
are still behind him.
He's up against
littleJimmy Calhoun
from West Covina, California.
Jimmy's gonna need more
than his usual cockiness
to defeat Milner here today.
[Announcer]
And the winner of the race,
thanks to littleJimmy's
exploding engine, is John Milner.
Not bad for an independent.
Yeah, but he's no competition.
[Man Over Radio, Indistinct]
Bulldog! Bulldog!
This is Escort One, over.
I don't think
this radio works.
Typical. Nothing works here.
[Man Over Radio]
Bulldog, this is escort one. Over.
American know-how.
[Gunfire]
Hey.!
[Gunfire Continues]
Bulldog, are you under fire?
Over.
That's affirmative.
From the other side of the river.
You gotta get us out of here quick!
Bulldog, we'll order
artillery into that area.
We can't...
We haven't got time for that.
You gotta get us out of here now
before they get here.
Break, break!
Dog, I'm gonna give
your position to artillery.
We'll drop some rocket fire
into that tree line.
When the area is secured,
we'll come pick you up.
[Gunfire]
You know what I think, Major?
I don't think you have the guts
to come down here, you asshole!
Can it, Fields.
You're talking your way
into a court-martial!
Now, drop some smoke.
Mark your position, you little shit!
Oh, what I'd give to open up
on that guy!
I think you're right. He is afraid
to come down here and get us.
Very good.
You're catching on.
[Gunfire]
He had just gotten in from Guam
in this canoe, and he was tryin'
to get her to buy...
Could I interrupt you
for one moment?
Let me just say this much.
Bobby, whatever you do,
don't drive through that park.
Whatever I do, I won't drive
through that park up there.
- Hey, man!
- Ooh! Uh-oh! What's that shit?
Whoo-hoo!
[Honking Horn]
That's a good weave.
Are you guys crazy?
Do you play an instrument?
You know what I think? I think
everybody should play an instrument.
Bobby, whatever you do,
don't hit those trash cans.
[Newt]
Hey, Bobby, go for two.
My father learned how to play
the trumpet, the guitar, the ukelele...
Can I interrupt you for one moment?
He doesn't mean anything.
Hejust talks a lot.
Whatever you do,
don't hit that Christmas tree.
Don't hit that tree.!
No sweat!
Hey! Whoo-hoo!
It's not normal.
This is crazy.
It's just a little bit crazy.
Look, I just wanted to tell you
about this friend of mine
who's a guitar player.
I know you have an opening.
If you'd just audition him, I know
you'd never live to regret it.
Sure. We'd be glad to.
Yeah.
Really?
That's okay with you?
Mm-hmm.
Okay. I'm gonna let my hand
off your mouth.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. No!
Bobby, whatever you do,
don't hit those trash cans!
[Bobby]
I think we hit something.
I think it was a fire hydrant.
Isn't it bad enough what's going on
in Vietnam, Andy?
You want it to start here too?
Don't start that.
I don't wanna hear it.
You remember Terry Fields?
Do you remember Toad?
Yeah.
Well, doesn't his death
mean anything to you?
Well, sure.
He's one of the reasons I'm here.
But if we give up this war, Andy,
then he'll have died for nothing.
He already died for nothing.
I don't want anyone else
to die for nothing.
I mean, that's the point!
[Protestors Screaming, Chanting]
[Siren Wailing]
[Screaming, Shouting]
Oh, goodness!
Come on. No, no!
No, no!
No! No, no! In here!
[Panting]
Whoa!
Sorry.
The campus is closed.
Closed?
Get moving.
No, I'm sorry. I've gotta...
I said, get moving.
Pacific Benefit Life!
Claims inspection.
Home office wants
a preliminary damage report,
and they want it fast.
These creeps have really
torn the hell out of the place.
That's what they come
to school for nowadays.
All right, buddy, go on through.
You need any help,
you just let me know.
Thank you.
Check my fuel line
and make sure it's on.
Are you gonna pull the plugs?
And get this other tire!
Damn! Jesus!
Hey, Beckwith, take it easy, huh?
[Announcer]
Two of the guys a lot of you
came to see, Milner and Beckwith.
This is gonna be a war.
Only one of them comes back to race
the Hunt brothers in the finals.
They're strapped in,
the engines are running.
Nitro fumes so thick,
the starter is about to pass out.
They're pounding the ground.
This is it.
[Revving Engine]
The winner of the race
is John Milner.
His chute ain't popping, man!
Let's get on it!
[Woman Screaming]
[Siren Wailing]
[Sinclair]
Oh, God.!
[Terry] It's too close.!
It's too close.!
They're supposed to be on
the other side of the river.!
Jesus Christ!
They almost killed us.
Typical!
[Man Over Radio]
Red Cap, plan complete.
Carry on.
Call the major.
Tell him it's clear.
But it's not.
They're all over the...
Tell him it's clear!
Come on, man.
You'd land, wouldn't ya?
Tell him!
Red One, Red Two.
You better come on in.
Charlie's on the run.
Come on in here.
Get us out quick!
[Helicopter Approaching]
Okay, here he comes!
Let's go! Come on!
Sinclair? Sinclair!
Come on.
What's the matter?
My-My-My foot.
I think I turned my foot.
Can you run?
I don't know.
Come on! You gotta try, man!
We gotta stay alive!
Get on your feet!
Get on your feet and get over there!
Move it, goddamn it!
Get outta here!
Go! Go! Go!
[Gunfire]
Come on, Fields, move it.!
One, two, three, heave!
* Cool jerk *
All right, give me more!
Come on, now!
We're gonna be late for the gig!
Heave!
Girl, come on over here
and help us!
Hurry up.!
You promise to give Lance a chance?
Ask him. He's the leader
of the group.
Did you let the brake off?
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't ask me.
We're gonna be late. Yeah!
We did it!
We did it!
Look, look, look!
The police, man!
The police!
Aw, shit!
You better stall, man!
It was terrible!
They had guns!
It was a '64 Chevy, light blue,
and they went that-a-way.
They shot at us!
Go get 'em!
Yes, ma'am.!
[Giggling]
[Siren Wailing]
You're a genius.!
I love you.! I love you.!
[Felix]
We got away.!
Let's go! Come on!
I should have never
brought you your wallet.
No, I should've never
gotten up this morning.
I wonder if Steven
fed the kids lunch.
Mark's such
a finicky eater.
And Steven.
Steve.!
Steven.!
Steve's out there!
Steven!
Steve.! Steven.! Whoo-hoo.!
Whoo-hoo, Steve.!
Steven? Steven!
Oh, Steven.!
Oh, Steve.!
There you are!
Steve!
I'm so glad I found you!
I love you.
I love you too.
How are the kids?
Are the kids okay?
The kids are fine.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yes, I am.
Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.
I should have never
left like that.
It's all right.
I know we can work this out
if we just talk about it.
Baby, I'm gonna let you get a job.
Oh, Steve!
In just a couple of years,
you'll find something you like...
A couple of years?
I'm gonna be reasonable about this.
We're gonna compromise.
That's no compromise.
A couple of years?
What?
I want to work now! Yesterday!
Damn it, Laurie!
You bastard!
Now it's completely
out of the question.
How dare you follow me like this,
and then tell me it's
out of the question!
How can you do that?
You're so inconsiderate.
And you're stubborn!
You're selfish, you're egotistical.
You know, you're...
You're bitchy.! You're conniving.!
- You'rejust like your father.!
- And you're exactly like your mother.!
My dad always said if you want to see
what your wife's gonna be like,
just look at her mother.
Well, Jesus Christ!
All right!
I want a divorce.
Here's your ring back.
Here's your ring back.
Oh, great. Throw it away.
Right. Why not?
Oh, man, we gotta
get them out of there.
[Sobbing]
Aw, pick up your ring.
Where did it go?
It's down here somewhere.
Wait a minute.
My wedding ring.
We gotta get out of here!
There it is...
Holy shit!
Pacific Benefit Life!
Peace. Peace on you.
[Wolfman Jack]
Can you dig it, baby?
Yes, indeed.!
We got it!
Ah, look at that!
That's it.
That's a shame too.
You beat me bad.
I wish I hadn't now.
You'd a-had a shot at the factory.
Hell, I couldn't have beat
those guys anyway.
You're the only one
who ever had a chance, man.
Really.
Thanks, but you're pretty good
yourself, you know.
You don't know shit about engines,
but your dragster looks good.
Well, thanks.
I know my front end...
wouldn't have bent like this.
What are you talking about?
Listen, isn't this Schiefer linkage?
So?
So, your wheels are
the same as mine.
So?
We'll take the whole damn
front section off my car
and we'll put it on your car.
Huh?
Yeah.
Hey, Bob, we're gonna need
that welder, okay?
Jim, can you get us some guys?
We only got about 15 minutes.
Maybe I can get 'em
to slow up at the line.
Check that out.
That might give us enough time.
Yeah!
- We're gonna beat 'em, John.
Me and you together.
- Thanks, Roger.
Come on, Carlos, get your tools.
Let's pull this front end off.
[Icelandic]
Oh, thanks a lot.
Here, you take something.
Go to work.
No, wait. Get your T-shirt on.
We're gonna beat those guys.
You gotta have your T-shirt.
Go on, get it!
All right, Car...
Look at the tools she gave me.
[Tools Clattering]
*Lonely *
*I'm so lonely *
*I have nobody *
**[Continues, Indistinct]
Fields.
You shouldn't be doing this.
You saved my life.
Yeah.
Some New Year's Eve,
huh?
I wanted to thank you.
Hey, I was scared.
I was really scared.
Congratulations.
You're normal.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Look at that man.
Look at those jerks.
Joe's dead,
and they're having a party.
May our victory
be a complete,
full and lasting one.
[Man]
Hear, hear.
And to you, sir,
a barrel of shit!
I gotta get out of here, man.
This isn't my war.
And now I'd like to propose
another toast.
To a very,
very brave man...
who today led his men
in a mission...
that accounted for more
than 200 Communists dead.
[Applause]
You're too kind, Congressman.
'Cause an officer
is only as good...
as the men he leads.
[Man]
Here, here.!
Aw, man! That does it!
I've had it!
And I'm gonna do
something about it.
I gotta get a hand grenade.
No, a satchel charge!
And I know just where to get it.
Hey, Terry, look, you can't.
They're officers.
It's not gonna solve anything.
Oh, yeah? Watch me.
*May the bird of paradise
fly up your nose *
*May an elephant caress you
with its toes *
*May your wife be plagued
with runners in her hose *
Hello.
Wanna dance?
Hello.
Um... No, thank you.
Why not?
Just don't feel like dancing,
that's all.
That ain't a very good reason.
Hey, man,
she's with the band.
So what?
She's gotta get on stage.
We can't do the gig without her.
Well, you know what?
You need a haircut.
You look like shit.
You know, I woke up this morning.
I looked in the mirror, I said,
"Newt, boy, you look like shit.
Get a haircut."
But, hell, you gotta have long hair
nowadays or you can't work.
Have a beer.
Come on.
Check you later, amigo.
Wow.
You sure we got
the right place?
Pretty tough joint.
It's a good gig.
We're making 20 bucks apiece tonight.
Here, you can play this.
What do you want me
to do with that?
Play it, unless you want that creep
hitting on you all night.
Yeah, he was a creep.
I can't blame him much.
I'd be hitting on you myself...
if I didn't know
you had an old man.
So, how do I play it?
Well, it's a pretty
complicated instrument.
Basically, what you do
is you hit it like this.
Uh-huh.
More advanced musicians
will hit it like that.
Uh-huh.
Like that. Like that.
You're gonna play
with the group.
Yeah, but I don't know
any of your stuff.
It's nothing. Just hit that thing
once in a while, dance around.
You're beautiful,
and they're gonna love you.
[Yelling, Shouting]
Where'd you take my wife?
Shut up.
I want you to know,
you're facing false arrest charges.
What's your badge number?
Hey, turn around!
I got it. I saw it.
You're gonna hear from my attorney.
One more word out of
your Commie mouth, kid, and...
Commie? L...
Turn around there!
I voted Republican.
Would you rather be called
a Fascist pig?
And I got a right to know
where my wife is.
Take it easy, Steve. She's all right.
Anyway, what can you do now?
Relax.
I'll tell you one thing.
Something like this happens,
it makes you realize how trivial
your marriage problems are.
Not trivial.
Low priority.
* Baby love
My baby love *
* I need ya
Oh, how I need ya *
[Banging]
*But all you do is treat me bad *
Hey! Quiet back there!
** [Continues, Softly]
[Sighs]
I wonder if this is gonna
cost me my P.T.A. Membership.
You should be so lucky.
* Baby love, my baby love
Been missin' ya *
*Miss kissin'ya *
Hey!
* Instead of breaking up *
- Oh, yeah?
- [Gasps]
Okay, let's get that butt out.
Go on, get it out.
* Baby love
My baby love *
Who's singing?
Who's singing?
* I need ya
Oh, how I need ya *
* But all you do is treat me bad *
Shut up.
I don't want any more singing.
* Break my heart
and leave me sad *
* Tell me, what did I do wrong *
* To make you stay away so long *
* Baby love
My baby love *
* Been missin' ya
Oh, I miss kissin' ya *
* Instead of breaking up *
* Let's do some kissin'
and makin' up *
* Don't throw our love away *
* In my arms you'll always stay *
* Baby love
My baby love *
* I need ya
Oh, how I need ya **
Come on, man. Let's hurry up.
Get this car started.
[Announcer]
Looks like some of the local drivers are
intentionally slowing down the pace...
trying to buy Milner some extra time.
From here, I can see the competitors who
are usually feuding with each other...
all helping out in Milner's cause.
Incredible.!
[Applause]
Here's the Hunt brothers'car
prepared for the kill.
They fully expect to win.
The factory demands they win.
Minutes to go, still no Milner.
Looks like the Hunt brothers
are about to demand...
a single run victory by default.
Carlos, you got
those plugs changed?
Yeah.
I got you some fuel here, John.
No, no.
I got my own mixture. 90%.
You'll blow your engine.
[Announcer]
Still no sign ofJohn Milner.
He knows the rules.
If you're not on the line in time,
you're disqualified.
Okay, we got it.
We'll never make it.
Come on, man.
Let's go!
[Announcer]
Frankly, it doesn't look good.
There's so little time left.
Probably a single run
for the Hunt brothers,
Milner losing by default.
But hold it!
Look over on the fire-up road.
Against all odds,
Milner has got it moving.!
Milner's made it to the line,
but that's just half of this
incredible mechanical miracle.
After all their patchwork, will the car
go straight down the track?
Will it go straight into
the guard rail?
It's a big gamble.
[Engine Rewing]
Think that front end
is gonna hold up?
I know it's gonna hold up.
[Announcer]
Nothing wrong with Milner's motor.
In fact,
both engines
making awesome power.
2,000 horsepower, side by side.
The final race
for top eliminator.
[Revving Engine]
[Announcer]
He's done it.!
Milner has done it, the impossible.
He's defeated
the Hunt brothers.
His crew has gone crazy.
The whole place has gone crazy.
John Milner, top eliminator.
Terry, you can't...
Shut up!
What if you get caught?
Just shut up
and do what I told you.
- I greased that one myself.
Right, Lieutenant?
- You damn sure did, sir.
Magnificent. Magnificent.
Here we are.
Oh, a cake.
Major, sir.
You're on officer's turf, Fields.
Yes, I know, sir.
I just wanted to have a word
with you if I could.
You speak to me in the morning!
Can't you see who I'm with here?
Yeah, I just wanted to know, sir,
since it's
New Year's Eve tonight,
why don't you let me off
latrine duty?
[Chuckling]
No way.
You're gonna be in the shit-house
the rest of your life.
Now get back over there.
All right, Major,
if that's the way you feel about it.
I just hope you enjoy your cake.
It's a good one.
Thank you.
Oh, uh, sir?
It's angel food.
[Congressman]
Son, maybe you'd like to stay...
and have a piece of it with us?
[Major]
No, sir.
He has a very important job to finish.
Oh.
To the latrines, you little turd.
[Congressman]
Well, um, who'll cut the cake?
[Chuckles]
I think this is an honor
you should have, Major.
Thank you, sir.
[Congressman]
When I get back to Washington,
I'm gonna tell the president...
about the fine fighting spirit
your men have here too.
God bless you.
Oh, wait a minute, Major.
Can we have a photograph
of this, please?
Yes, sir.
Fields!
Get in there and get to work!
Would you stand up, please?
One moment.
We'll do it together.
To the V.C.
Let 'em eat cake!
- [Congressman] What was that?
- Charlie must've
booby-trapped the latrine!
There was a man in there.
Fields!
Oh, my God. Fields.!
Probably won't be enough
left ofhim to send home.
[Gags]
It's a dirty war.
It's a lot of shit.
They love you, Debbie.
They love you!
Where'd you learn
how to dance like that?
Ballet class.
[Men Whooping]
You're a lot of woman.
What's wrong?
Debbie, what's wrong?
What's wrong, girl?
It's Lance.
He's dancing with another girl.
Well... Maybe there's a reason.
Maybe it's his sister or something.
That's not his sister.
Oh, hell, my bet
is it's nothing at all.
Why don't you just go over
and ask him what's going on.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Cut this stuff out.
Look, Debbie,
the only way to handle
these kind of things
is to be adult about it.
Just go over and ask him
what's happening, all right?
Come on. Come on.
[Blows Party Horn]
Lance?
Debbie.
I loved you!
I paid your bail!
It looks bad. I know.
It's New Year's Eve!
I tried to get you a job!
Happy New Year.
Just a minute, okay?
* Now the race is on
and here comes pride
up the backstretch *
*Heartache is going to the inside *
*My tears are holding back *
* Trying not to fall *
*My heart's out of the runnin'*
* True love's scratched
for another's sake *
* The race is on
and it looks like heartaches *
*And the winner loses all *
* One day I ventured in love
never once suspectin' *
* What the final result would be *
*I live in fear
of waking up each morning *
*And finding that
you're gone from me *
* There's ache and pain
in my heart *
*For today was the one
I hated to face *
*Somebody new came up
the winner *
* And I came out in second place **
Steven.! Steve, up here.
Here I am.
Hey, Andy.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Look, I have to tell you something.
I just want you to be happy. If that
means getting a job or whatever...
Really? You mean it, really?
Oh, good. I found my ring.
I swear to God.
Buddy, wanna step away
from the bus, please.
This is my wife.
I'm his wife.
I don't care if
she's your pet monkey.
Just step away from the bus,
will you, pal?
Look, she's not a demonstrator.
No, no, Officer.
We just got caught up in this.
That's right.
We're both innocent.
- Nobody's innocent.
- We don't even go to this school.
Just step away from the bus.
Leave him alone.!
Leave him alone.!
Would you just leave him... Aah.!
[Women Shouting]
Leave him alone.!
Just leave him alone.!
[Screaming]
Stop it, you bastard.!
[Gasping, Coughing]
You don't like it, huh?
You don't like it?
[Laurie]
You pig.! You pig.!
[All Shouting]
Come here!
[Coughing]
What happened?
The bus.!
They're stealing the damn bus.
[Cheering]
[Honking Horn]
[Yelling, Shouting]
[Laurie]
Out of sight!
You're a hero
of the revolution.
He's my hero! He's my hero!
He deserves a little kiss too.
The victory's partly his.
Hey!
Well, John, people
are gonna be hearing about this.
You'll be gettin' sponsors
sure as hell.
Well, when I do,
I'll just come back here
and beat the shit outta you again.
[Icelandic]
Here, you look better holding it.
Excuse me.
Eva, we gotta go.
Come on.
Hey, where have you been?
Dicky Dollwith!
What a mistake that was.
Talk about an animal.
100% crude animal!
Come on. We're late.
Wait a minute.
I gotta talk to her.
She can't talk to you.
We're supposed to go to some
dippy dinner with my parents.
Anyway, she doesn't understand
anything you're saying.
No, no, it's important.
I gotta talk to her.
Does anybody here speak Swedish?
Yeah, I speak a little Swedish.
Get outta here!
John, I bet old Ole does.
Oh, that's right.
Come here.
Wait. No... Hey.
I gotta get her home.
Hey, Ole, wait a second.
Come on.
Listen, do you speak Swedish?
No.
Aw!
I speak Norwegian.
Well, try talking to her.
[Speaking Norwegian]
She isn't Swedish.
She's from Iceland.
Iceland.
Well, you can talk to her?
I think so.
Well, tell her I love her.
Tell her I want to marry her.
And, uh... And tell her I want
to go out with her tonight.
How many times do I have to tell you?
We gotta have dinner
with my parents tonight.!
Then ask her if she wants to watch
the Rose Bowl game tomorrow.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
She said she would
like to very much...
and she also thinks
you are a very attractive man.
And... And one other thing.
A big victory kiss.
Come on, Eva.
We gotta go now. Come on.
Be careful,
and I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks, Ole.
Yeah.
[Wolfman Jack]
Mary Welles with "My Guy."
Oh, it's a great New Year's Eve.
And don't be checkin'your clocks,
'cause the old Wolfman's
got the correct time here.
I'm gonna be countin'you down
and countin'you
right up into the new year.
You should've been there.
How'd they take it?
How'd they take it?
How did they take it?
Right on the head, man.
Tons of it! Tons of it.
I love it!
It was beautiful. It was great.
And they think I'm dead?
They really think I'm killed?
The congressman said
it was a tragic loss,
and he's personally
gonna write a letter of condolence
to your family.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's not easy, but I guess
there's nothing we can do about it.
Did you get the stuff?
Oh, yeah.
There's food, survival kit.
I even scraped together some dough.
Oh, terrific, man. Boots?
Two pair.
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- You really gonna walk outta here?
I got news for you, pal.
I'm halfway home already.
You know,
you may not be able to go home.
You're a deserter now.
Ah, what the hell? I've always
kind of wanted to see Europe.
Oh, come on. Look at me.
I'm a free man.
The war is over, and I win.
I love your shirt.
[Chuckles]
Take care of yourself,
huh, pal?
Hey, you too.
- I owe you dinner.
- It's a deal.
[Laughing]
How you doin'?
Terrible.
Me too.
I wish I could
make you feel better.
Oh, well.
Listen, why don't you
come with us?
Where y'all going?
Mount Tam,
watch the sun come up.
I don't think so.
Come on.
You got nothing better to do.
It's New Year's Eve.
Cheer up.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
With you?
Yeah.
Hey, Debbie.
Come on. Cheer up.
Listen, breaking up ain't easy to do.
I know it, because
I've been there before.
I never will forget
my old girlfriend,
Loretta Louise Willa MaeJordan
the Second.
Did you know that
her old man before me was a welder?
And, Debbie, let me tell ya,
he had scars all up and down his arms.
You should've seen it.
Let me ask you a question.
You got any scars?
I got an appendix scar.
You know what? Just came to my mind.
I used to know a guy
whose whole face was a scar.
Guess what they used to call him.
You won't believe it. Right?
What?
Scar. Mm-hmm.
But I didn't think that was very funny,
because the poor guy
burned himself up trying
to pour gas in a carburetor.
Wait a minute.
Speaking of gas,
I had beans for dinner.
Stop. Stop!
I'm startin'to feel it.
What, what, what?
Can I tell you something?
Yeah, okay. What?
Whatever you do,
don't hit those garbage cans!
[Laughing, Shouting]
I wonder what the guys
in the junior chamber
are gonna say about this.
I mean, just...
Hey, look at this.
[Laurie]
Oh, gee.
I almost forgot what day it is.

* And never brought to mind *
* Should auld acquaintance *
Yeah!
* Be forgot *
* And days of auld lang syne *
* And days of auld lang syne, my dear *
* And days of auld lang syne *
* We'll drink a cup
of kindness yet *
*And days of auld lang syne *
*Should auld acquaintance *
*Be forgot *

* Once upon a time
you dressed so fine *
* You threw the bums a dime
in your prime *
*Didn't you *
*People'd call, say beware doll
You're bound to fall *
* You thought they were all *
*Kiddin'you *
* You used to *
*Laugh about *
*Everybody that was hangin'out *
*Now you don't talk so loud *
*Now you don't seem so proud *
*About havin'to be scrounging *
* Your next meal *
*How does it feel *
*How does it feel *
* To be without a home *
*Like a complete unknown *
*Like a rolling stone *
* Oh, you've gone
to the finest school *
*All right, Miss Lonely
but you know you only used to get *
*Juiced in it *
*Nobody's ever taught you
how to live out on the street *
*And now you're gonna have to get *
* Used to it *
* You say you never compromise *
* With the mystery tramp
but now you realize *
*He's not selling any alibis *
*As you stare into the vacuum
ofhis eyes *
*And say
Do you want to *
*Make a deal *
*How does it feel *
*How does it feel *
* To be on your own *
* With no direction home **
