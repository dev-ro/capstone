GEORGE ORWELL's
Memorable fable
Animal farm
To the world we all know
which may or may not be
the best world possible
once again
spring time had come.
But all the magical spring
was not enough
to conceal the misery
of manor farm.
Once striving and fruitfull
the farm and it's owner
Mr Jermans
had fallen on evil days.
Decept by problems
of his own making
Mr Jermans
had turned to drink.
And for his misary
he had found
fine company.
On the evening
our story begins,
it was later than usual
when Mr Jermans came home
from drinking
to make his rounds.
On this night,
all the animals
had agreed
that as soon as
Mr Jermans was in bed
they would gather
in the main barn
for a secret meeting
called by Old Major
the pryest bullhog
who because of his years
was regarded as by far
the wisest of the animals.
The other pigs
started first
for the meeting
being clever and
found to taking the lead.
They were followed
by Boxer,
the largest and strongest
of the horses
and his devoted friend
Benjamin the donkey.
All the other animals
great and small
were anxious to get there,
for such a meeting
has never been held before.
Old Major had been ailing
and now he had made known
there were some things
he wanted to say
to his fellow animals
before it might be too late.
It took a while for all
to find their seats.
The pigs have taken up
the best positions
inmediatly in front of
the platform.
Among them Snowball,
determined
to get a good view.
And Napoleon
equally determined
and even less polite.
Dear...
What was that?
No.
No it wasn't Mr Jermans.
And at last everyone
could be settled
to hear up Old Major.
My dear friends,
I have lived
a long live.
I have had much time
to thought as I layed
alone in my stole.
I won't be with you much longer.
And before I die, there is something
I want to tell you.
Few of us will ever know
the blessings
of a piecefull old age.
You Boxer, when you have given
the last of your great strength.
What then?
Whatever we produce,
is taken from us.
Stolen from us. And sold.
Our children are born
to cold and hunger.
Look at them while you can.
You porkers.
You know what the future
holds for you?
Do we deserve such a fate?
Is this farm too poor
to support us all?
No comrades.
When the farm is rich,
we would never get
our rigthfull share
from farmer Johns.
Who has only seen your tyrant.
And we shall be rich and free!
Comrades,
Revolt!
But remember:
when you have
got rid of Johns.
Don't adopt his wises!
We animals are brothers.
Large or small,
clever or simple,
fur or feathers,
now and forever
all animals are equal!
The very next morning
- sooner perhaps then
Old Majer would have predicted -
the animals
found their situation
quite unbearable.
And so almost before
they realised it,
the animals have
fought and won.
They had causalties to moan
and those who died
left children
to be cared for.
But manor farm was theirs
and they lost no time
in destroying everything
that reminded them
of hatefull Mr Jermans.
When it came to
Mr Jermans's house
the animals hesitated.
Napolen showed the way,
but Snowball took the lead
in entering the place
where their
tyrant had lived.
The animals were all agreed,
that Johns's house
was no place for them.
All, that is
except Napoleon.
Meantime Snowball
lead the other animals
in organizing a new society
which they now named
Animal Farm.
So that all
might see and agree
the laws of animal farm
where inscribed
in a prominent place
to be remembered
and obeyed forever.
NO ANIMAL SHALL
SLEEP IN A BED
NO ANIMAL SHALL
DRINK ALCOHOL
FOUR LEGS GOOD
TWO LEGS BAD
Wings count as legs.
Four legs good,
two legs bad.
NO ANIMAL SHALL
KILL ANOTHER ANIMAL
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL
Tending farm by themselves
caused problems to the animals
but the pigs could
figure a way around
every difficulty.
Boxer was the
admiration of everybody.
He had been
a hard worker
in Johns's time.
But now he seemed more
like three horses in one.
Instructed by Snowball
other animals worked out
the rest for themselfes.
And the farm work
was done like magic.
The success
of their effort
delighted everyone
including the sly Napoleon
and his constant companion
fat pig Squiler.
That somer the animals
without any help
or any interference
made a going proposition
of animal farm.
The fields yielded richly
and they were cut and gleamed with
dilettance and devotion.
With the harvest safely home
the animals had time
to think of the future
and at a meeting in the big barn
many resolutions were put forward.
It was always the pigs
how made the resolutions.
Comrades.
Our first five month plan
is a farmwide triumph.
and the time has come
to spread the glorious news.
So that our
downtrodden comrades
on other farms
will break their chains
and join the
animal revolution.
Go!
Tell them on there is an animal farm
to the world!
Some animals
content with their luck
were unimpressed
by tales of
peace and plenty.
Others
happy in their
own surroundings
were alarmed
of the sort of
any change.
But whereever they were having
a bad time animals listened
with interest.
In certrain quarters
the rebellious behavior
of a lot of dumb animals
caused indignation
much conversation,
but nothing was done about it.
For the drunken Mr Jermans
and his cronies
did not know what to do.
Snowball felt that
education was
the animals next necessity.
Some of the animals
were brighter than others
of course.
Four legs good,
two legs bad.
Snowball set himself
to solve the problem
of power on the farm.
And so did Napoleon.
In january
there came
bitterly hard weather.
Inexperienced management
brought shortages
to animal farm,
but Snowball continued
his thinking
for the future.
And in such thoughts
he was not alone.
Comrades.
I have prepared
a new plan for
animal farm.
Here it is.
All it needs is your votes.
At first
we will have to
work more and eat less.
But my plan
will bring us
elektricity.
It will mean
a worm pound in winter,
a light in every stall,
hutch and roost.
luxury for all.
Comrades. In one short year
animal farm will be
the finest in the world.
Dreams, dreams.
A vote for my plan
is a vote for
a live beautyfull.
It's a lie.
I promise you a 4 day week.
Gush!
-Perhabs a 3 day week.
-Nonesense.
A one day week.
With Snowball's disposal
Napoleon
stepped up confidently
to take charge of animal farm,
and fat, pig Squiler
became his obedient
follower and assistant.
Comrades.
Snowball is a treator.
What was he really planning?
To bring back Johnes.
Now let's have
no more of these
useless meetings.
From now on,
I'll protect
your interests!
And I'll make
your decisions!
Let me show you
my plan for
animal farm.
For legs good,
two legs bad.
And so the windmill
was started after all.
Nothing could have been
achived without Boxer
whose strength was greater
than that of all the other
animals' put together.
Supervised by the pigs
all the animals
worked long shifts
which lasted
from dawn til dust.
Rations were shortened for the workers
but the pigs
by virtuing
their brainwork
were splendidly provided for.
But the greatest inspiration
come from Boxer,
who with his friend Benjamin
worked early and late
in season and out.
One evening after working
hard and late as usual
Boxer and Benjamin
made a curious discovery.
Word of what now went on
at night in Johns's house
spread quickly to Animal Farm.
Some of the animals tought
they remembered
the law against bed,
but obviusly
they where mistaken.
And now other changes
in the laws of Animal Farm
were installed.
-Those ungratefull
beasts of yours.
-Cheer up!
They won't last...
Another winter
will bring them
to their knees.
-Anyway where do they get
the things they need.
In Mr Jermans's circle
the subject of shortages
at Animal Farm
was a popular one.
And the sharp trader named Whymper
was just the sort
to do something about it.
Comrades, our leader
as wise as he is beloved
has decided to trade
with the outside world.
Not again of course
with our noble principles.
You hanes
are having the honor of
making the first contribution
all your eggs.
I know how proud you are
of this privilege.
The chickens
seemed to remember
Old Major saying
that they're eggs should
never be taken from them.
The innocent suffered with the guilty
and the chicken's uprising
was short lived.
Comrades
I have made
a terrible discovery.
There are
traitors among us.
Yes, comrades,
in lead with
Johnes and Snowball
to destroy Animal Farm.
Who else is guilty?
Stand up and confess!
NO ANIMAL SHALL KILL
ANOTHER ANIMAL
WITHOUT CAUSE
The revolution is now complete.
We have no more use
for that song
see it is now forbidden
at the penalty of death.
Trade between Animal Farm
and the outer world
now became quite brisk.
As might be expected
Mr Whimper's profits
has inspired others
to seek their share.
Or at least
give vent
to their jelousy.
-Animal Farm seems
to be making money
for Whimper.
-Who ever heard of
animals running a Farm.
-What about their windmill?
-Come on and
let's kick them out.
-Yes, kick them out.
The original owner
was not invided
to join this movement.
His neighbours
let him know
his day was done.
Comrades
the enemy has mobilised
all his forces against us.
We must save Animal Farm
from its enemies
at all costs we have.
Now is the time to fight...
Victory.
Now begun the
heartbreaking job
of rebuilding.
And as before
Boxer and Benjemin
worked hardest of all.
By now supervision
of the work by pigs
was hardly nessesary,
so they had time
to less labourious
persuits.
Long after
the other animals
left the job
Boxer and Benjamin
worked on and on
giving their all
year in, year out.
A new generation of pigs
grow up.
And one would considered
odds and graces
very flattering to Animal Farm
and it's preceding genious.
But still
the windmill
was not finished,
and Boxer's injured foot
got worse insted of better.
It looked as though
Boxer was dead
but he wasn't, not quite.
Boxer banged his head,
he will never work again.
What do we do?
While Napoleon and Squiller
made plans for Boxer,
Benjamin predicted
he could look forward
to a deserved rest and retirement.
Next day
the windmill work
went on as usual
but now without Boxer.
And during the morning
what appeared to be
an ambulance arrived.
Only Benjamin suspected
it wasn't an anbulance.
The other animals
finally recognised
the death wagon
from Mr. Whimper's
glue factory.
I was with him
right to the end,
his last words were:
forward comrades,
long live Napoleon.
And for the wicked rumor that Boxer
was sold to a glue factory
our belived leader
would never do that.
Long live Napoleon!
Long live Napoleon!
At that night
the pigs drunk
to Boxer's memory
with the wiskey
they have bought
with Boxer's live.
Years passed,
the seasons came and went.
The short animal lives fled by.
The completed windmill
stood as a monument
to it builder's fate
and sacrifice.
But the animals revolution
was only dimly remembered.
Outwardly Animal Farm
appeared prosperous.
But the animals themselves
were no better of,
with the exception of the pigs
and they supreme leader
Napoleon.
This pig-run enterprise
now had many of the fruits
of real civilization.
And one fine day
pig delegates
from far and wide
arrived to Animal Farm
to celebrate
the coming of a new era.
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL
BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE
MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
When reports
of this great change
reached them
other animals
everywhere were incredoulus.
This made them indignant.
They headed toward Animal Farm
from all directions
instinctively uniting
once again in common cause.
Loyal followers!
On farms
owned and operated
by the pigs
there is order and discipline.
All of the animals
do more work and eat less
than on other farms.
With this I will encourage you
to make your loyal animals
work even harder
and eat even less.
To a greater Animal Farm.
To peace and plenty
under pigrule.
To the day when pigs
own and operate farms everywhere.
To the animals now it seemed
that the world
which may or may be not
some day become
a happy place to live in
was worse than ever
for orinary creatures.
And another moment have come
when they must do
something about it.
