I spoke to Mr. Babbitt on that
just this morning.
I'm stiII sitting on four Lamborghinis
that can't meet
the smog emission standards.
How many times
you wash out with EPA?
Yes, they're finaIIy cIearing EPA.
Just one or two more days.
Three times?
We're reaIIy on a roII here.
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for 1 2.
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?
I toId you I've never deaIt with
these Lamborghinis before,
yet you assured me you couId
deIiver within that time frame.
Don't teII me that,
'cause I'm not Iistening.
Sir, I hardIy think
that's necessary.
I'II expIain that to my swing Ioan.
I'm sure he'II be sympathetic.
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's three zeros.
I've got aII my money
tied up in these cars.
If I don't get my money out,
I am finished. You understand?
You have to
understand our situation.
I don't give a shit. I've got
sharks snapping at my heeIs.
They couId've taken the car
and my business 1 1 days ago.
I'm under coIIateraI,
for God's sake.
I understand, I know
deIivery is way overdue.
Fuckin' EPA--
whoIe worId is choking on smog,
and they're gonna
correct the situation
by keeping my four cars
off the road?
Babbitt CoIIectibIes.
Have you tried cash? How much
can these EPA guys earn in a week?
CharIie, it's Wyatt.
About the swing Ioan.
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna seize aII the cars.
I'm gonna have to caII you back.
You shouId taIk
to Mr. Babbitt on this.
TeII him I signed
a check on Tuesday,
you watched me sign it,
then you gave it to the maiI girI.
Come on! I need this!
Come on!
I wouIdn't do that untiI you
taIk to Mr. Babbitt personaIIy.
A number for him?
He's on the road just now.
He wants you
to caII him immediateIy.
TeII him I'm arriving 1 :30 a.m.,
can he Ieave a number?
What, Lenny? TaIk to me.
Mr. Bateman wants to back out
and take Mr. Webb with him.
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at VaIIey Motors,
and they want to go that way.
TeII him that was me
on the other Iine,
the cars passed emissions, the EPA
paperwork wiII be here momentariIy.
- You paying attention?
- I'm Iistening.
TeII them I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deaIs
because I appreciate
their patience.
- Do you understand?
- I've got it.
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Iine.
As it happens, the cars
are passing emissions--
What am I saying--
the cars have passed emissions.
We're waiting for the EPA paperwork--
we'II have that momentariIy.
And because of your
incredibIe patience,
we're going to knock off
$5,000 on each car.
WeII, yes,
you've been most patient.
We reaIIy appreciate your patience.
WeII, thank you.
Thank you.
Ready for PaIm Springs?
You stiII want to go
with aII these probIems?
We're seconds away from
cIosing this deaI, cIearing 75 grand.
Not bad for
a coupIe of phone caIIs.
Not bad at aII.
You know where to find us,
right, Lenny?
Right. I got it under controI.
Listen, I don't want
to be demanding here,
but couId you possibIy say,
I don't know, 10 or 1 2 words
before we get to the hoteI?
Consider it forepIay.
Can you incIude me
in some of your thoughts?
I'm just thinking.
Nothing speciaI.
I'm just thinking.
Maybe there's something you're
thinking about that we can taIk.
If there was something to taIk about,
Susanna, we'd be taIking.
I'm just thinking. What's the big to-do
about me thinking here?
I just feeI Iike I'm going away
for a few days with someone.
CaII me crazy.
You wanna taIk, Iet's taIk.
How was your day?
- I don't want to taIk!
- No, Iet's taIk!
I feeI Iike you're excIuding me.
It's not that I want to taIk.
One of these again. How did we
get back to one of these?
I don't know why
I put up with aII this.
You wanted to go
to PaIm Springs, and we're going.
But I didn't want to go aIone.
I've been sitting in this car
for more than an hour and a haIf--
You want to taIk, Iet's taIk!
This is not taIking,
this is you going Iike--
Yeah.
Charlie. this is Lerry.
h've beer tryirg
to cortact you for a while.

from a Mr. Moorey.

He's beer tryirg to reach you.
Your father has died. Charlie.

That's not necessary.
Anything eIse?
No. that's it. Lister.
if there's arythirg h car do--
AII right.
- Sorry about the weekend, hon.
- CharIie, the weekend?
Look, I toId you before, we had
a faIIing out a Iong time ago.
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.
We just didn't get aIong.
- You're going to the funeraI, no?
- Yeah.
I'm coming with you.
That's reaIIy sweet,
but there's reaIIy no point.
I want to. That's the point.
AII right, I'm sorry.
I forgot who I was taIking to.
...for our memory,
admiration, and respect for him
wiII Iive beyond the years
of his Iife on Earth.
Let us consecrate ourseIves
to foIIow his exampIe of zest for Iife,
dedication to famiIy,
and charity to aII.
And now, with sure and
certain hope of resurrection,
we commend to you the souI
of our departed friend.
Just have to go over the detaiIs
of the wiII tonight, then we're outta here.
Sure, I can wait
in the car if you Iike.
Somebody shouId be watering
those roses--they're aII dying.
I knew this car my whoIe Iife.
OnIy drove it once.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster
convertibIe.
OnIy 8,000 production modeIs made.
Straight-8. FirebaII-8.
It was the first fuII year
of the DynafIow transmission.
I know it by rote.
You were his onIy chiId.
You came aIong when he was,
what, 45 or something?
ProbabIy thought he was
never going to have a son.
So he had to Iove you.
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his chiId,
his son, his bIood.
Anyway, in these pictures here,
he doesn't Iook Iike a man
who doesn't Iove his chiId.
Put that away.
- You wanna hear a story?
- But don't get mad.
You know the convertibIe? His baby.
That and the goddamn roses.
Buick.
The car was off-Iimits to me.
''That's a cIassic,'' he'd say.
''It commands respect.
It's not for chiIdren.''
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years oId,
and for once,
I bring home a report card
and it's aImost aII A's.
I go to my oId man,
''Can I take the car out?''
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.
He says no. I take it anyway.
I steaI the keys, I sneak it out.
You took the car
with no permission?
Why? Why then?
Because I deserved it.
Nothing I did was
good enough for this guy.
Don't you understand that?
We're on
CoIumbia Parkway, four kids.
- We get puIIed over.
- An accident?
PuIIed over.
- What is puIIed over? PoIice?
- Yes, poIice.
Can I finish?
He caIIed in a report
of a stoIen car--
not his son took the car
without permission--just stoIen.
CentraI station, the other guys'
dads baiI them out in an hour,
he Ieft me there two days.
- He Ieft you in prison for two days?
- Two days.
Were you scared?
Yeah, I was scared.
Left home.
I never saw him again.
CharIie, after a year
we've been together,
this is the first time
I've heard this story.
It's strange.
How can you keep aII this
inside you and not say anything?
When I was a kid and got scared,
the Rain Man wouId come
and sing to me.
''Rain'' what?
One of those imaginary
chiIdhood friends.
- What happened to him?
- Nothing. I just grew up.
Not so much.
''And I remember, too,
the day you Ieft home,
''so fuII of bitterness
and grandiose ideas,
''so fuII of yourseIf.
''And being raised
without a mother,
''the hardness of your heart
is understandabIe, as weII.
''Your refusaI to even pretend
that you Ioved or respected me,
''aII these I forgive.
''But your faiIure to write,
to teIephone,
''to reenter my Iife in any way,
has Ieft me without a son.
''I wish you aII
I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.''
''I hereby bequeath to my son,
CharIes Sanford Babbitt,
''that certain Buick convertibIe,
''the very car that, unfortunateIy,
brought our reIationship to an end.
''AIso, outright titIe to my
prizewinning hybrid rosebushes.
''May they remind him
of the vaIue of exceIIence
''and the possibiIity of perfection.
''As for my home and aII other
property, reaI and personaI,
''these shaII be pIaced in trust
in accordance with the terms
of that certain instrument
executed concurrentIy herewith.''
The Iast part,
what does that mean?
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 miIIion
after expenses and taxes,
wiII go into a trust fund
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't teII you that.
- Who controIs the money? You?
- It's caIIed a trustee.
What is that?
How does that work?
Forgive me, but there's
nothing more I can say.
Now, I'm sorry, son.
I can see you're disappointed.
Why shouId I be disappointed?
I got rosebushes, didn't I?
I got a used car, didn't I?
What's-his-name got--
what'd you caII him?
- Beneficiary.
- Right. He got $3 MiIIion.
But he didn't get the rosebushes.
I got the rosebushes.
I definiteIy got the rosebushes.
There is no need--
To what? To be upset?
To be upset?
If there is a HeII, sir,
my father is in it,
and he is Iooking up right now
and he is Iaughing his ass off.
Sanford Babbitt--you want to be
that guy's son for five minutes?
Did you hear that Ietter?
Were you Iistening?
Yes, sir, I was. Were you?
No. CouId you repeat it?
'Cause I can't beIieve my fuckin' ears.
I was Iooking for you.
How did it go?
I got what I expected.
This couId take a few minutes.
- Can I heIp you?
- Yes, I think you can.
I have a probIem
with a private trust--
- That's a terrific suit.
- Thank you.
My father was Sanford Babbitt...
Is this WaIIbrook?
Excuse me.
Is this WaIIbrook?
Excuse me.
Dr. Bruner is stiII in conference.
WouId you Iike to wait
in his outer office?
No, we'II stay here.
Thank you.
Maybe we're not supposed
to be Iooking around here, no?
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.
$20 starts you all off
or a very importart match.
hr what 1 980 comedy film did
Goldie Hawr get away from it all?
Private Benjamin.
Excuse me, pIease.
I want to watch the TV, pIease.
For whose grardsor
was the presidertial retreat
Camp David ramed? Lisa?
- Eiserhower.
- That's right. David Eiserhower.
You've got arother five.
$ 1 0 lead for Lisa.
hr days of yore. what would
a swashbuckler keep ir his sheath ?
Whatever this is, I don't
understand the point of secrecy.
The patient is
an oId girIfriend of my father's?
I knew your father
since you were two years oId.
The year my mother died.
I'm trustee of the fund, but this hospitaI
receives nothing from that.
That hardIy seems fair.
That's something we couId discuss.
I took on this burden
out of IoyaIty to your father.
That's where my IoyaIty ends.
And you think I shouId feeI
a IittIe of that IoyaIty?
I think you feeI cheated
out of your birthright
by a man who had
difficuIty showing Iove.
And if I were in your shoes,
I'd probabIy feeI the same.
I was hoping you wouId expIain
my father's side of it,
heIp me understand
the right in what he's done,
because, faiIing that, I have
responsibiIities of my own,
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.
I'm sorry, this is not your car.
It's my boyfriend's.
My dad Iets me drive
sIow on the driveway.
I'm an exceIIent driver.
Are you sure
that you drive this car?
There's 28 miIes on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.
- ShouId be more than 28 miIes.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.
'Course, today's Monday.
I aIways drive on Saturday,
never drive on Monday.
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.
WeII, he can jump out.
- I'm an exceIIent driver.
- That's good. Come on.
Why did you Iet him in?
It's not a toy.
He says he drives this car.
Dad Iets me drive sIow
on the driveway every Saturday.
'Course, the seats were originaIIy
brown Ieather, now they're pitifuI red.
You know, these seats
were brown Ieather.
- You know this car?
- I know this car.
How do you know this car?
DefiniteIy know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-8, FirebaII-8.
OnIy 8,095 production modeIs.
Dad Iets me drive sIow on
the driveway, but not on Mondays.
- DefiniteIy not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.

That's my address.
What is it with this guy?

Died January 5, 1965,
after a short--
Who the heII are you?
Wait, where are you going?
1 3 minutes to Judge Wapner
and The People's Court.
Wait a second, I want to
ask you a question.
Hey, I'm taIking to you!
Bruner, who is this guy?
Raymond is your brother.
My brother?
I don't have a brother.
''...have their dispute
settIed here in our forum,
The People's Court. ''
''The People's Court. ''
''The People's Court. ''
The People's Court.
Hello. h'm Doug Llewelyr.
ard welcome to
The PeopIe's Court.
- Is he crazy?
- No.
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactIy.
- But he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.
I don't know what that means.
Some peopIe Iike him used
to be caIIed idiot savants.
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abiIities.
- Yeah, but he's retarded.
- Autistic. ActuaIIy, high-functioning.
What does that mean?
It means there's a disabiIity
that impairs the sensory input
and how it's processed.
EngIish here.
You're taIking over my head.
Raymond has a probIem
communicating and Iearning.
He can't even express himseIf
or probabIy even understand
his own emotions in a traditionaI way.
...ard after that. the dog bit him.
h yelled at my dog.
the dog laid dowr...
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.
Routines, rituaIs--
it's aII he has to protect himseIf.
RituaIs. That's a good one.
It's the way he acts, sIeeps, eats,
uses the bathroom,
waIks, taIks, everything.
Any break from
the routines, and it's terrifying.
- How Iong has he been here?
- WeII, I came here in 1960.
No, how oId is he?
He was 1 8 or 20 then.
I'd have to check records--
- You've been here that Iong?
- That's when I actuaIIy started.
'65, '75, '85--
I was aImost three years oId.
You knew he had a brother,
you knew I was his brother.
Yes, but what's the point?
What's the point?
What's the fuckin' point?
Why didn't anybody teII me
I had a brother?
What wouId you have done about it?
I don't know.
Does he know
how much money he's been Ieft?
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.
He's just inherited $3 miIIion,
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?
That is fucking poetic,
don't you think?
Good oId Dad.
Who's pIaying first? Yes.
The feIIow's name
on first base. Who.
The feIIow pIaying
first base for St. Louis. Who.
What is this?
Why is he doing that?
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does ''Who's On First?''
- From Abbott and CosteIIo.
- Why?
It's his way of deaIing with you
touching his books and stuff.
So he memorized
''Who's On First?''
Yeah, that among other things.
Raymond,
Ted KIuszewski.
Ted KIuszewski,
Big KIew, first base.
He pIayed for Cincinnati.
'Course, he was traded
for Dee Fondy, 1957.
- Lifetime batting average .298.
- AII these books. He reads, huh?
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.
V-E-R-N! 'Course, these peopIe
are gonna be here aII day.
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.
This is definiteIy
not a weekend visit, Vern.
He's getting anxious.
It's okay, Ray!
V-E-R-N, this is
an unannounced visit.
Put it back. He said
not to touch the books.
Not to touch books.
- You Iike Shakespeare?
- I don't know.
- Did you read aII this?
- I don't know. Vern.
- Did you read Macbeth ?
- I don't know.
- You read Hamlet?
- I don't know.
- The Twelfth Night?
- Stop it!
- Yes.
- Yes?
You read aII the stories
that are in this book,
and you don't know if
you read the book?
- I don't know. V-E-R-N.
- You don't know?
Maybe you better put it back.
You don't know. Okay.
No, Ray, take it easy.
I'm not going to--
I won't touch anything eIse.
It's ok, Ray. It's okay.
Come on. My main man.
Vern, my main man.
My main man, Vern.
It's okay, Ray.
- My main man.
- Yeah, my main man.
Here are your cards.
I'm sorry, I didn't know where
you want me to put them.
Are you taking any
prescription medication?
He Iikes you.
That's just his way of showing it.
When I touched him before,
he puIIed away.
Don't take it personaI.
He never touched me.
I'm cIoser to him
than anybody in the worId.
Known him for nine years.
It's not in him.
If I Ieft town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye,
he'd never notice.
He wouIdn't notice if you Ieave?
I'm not sure, but I don't think
peopIe are his first priority.
Hey, Ray, you want
to go take a waIk?
Can he hear us
when he's Iike that?
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?
'Course, it's
27 minutes to Jeopardy!
Don't worry, Ray,

PracticaIIy
26 minutes to Jeopardy!
- We'II bring him right back.
- 26 minutes to Jeopardy!
I won't do it.
I won't do it!
First of aII, because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--
You're upset. Just caIm down.
Raymond, I'm going
to taIk to Susanna aIone.
Goodbye, Raymond.
Just hoId on.
I'II be right back.
No, just stay.
Just stay there.
Just stay there.
Just stand stiII, okay?
That's good.
I'II do it if you teII me why--
why do I do--
What?
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there,
and wait for you again at the gate?
I've been waiting
for you for days. Why?
It's for Raymond.
The car disturbs him.
- That's why?
- That's why.
What are you Iooking at?
The ducks are over here.
I don't know.
Listen, our father died.
Did you know that he died Iast week,
did they teII you that?
I don't know.
You don't know if they toId you,
or you don't know what dead is?
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.
You want to go see him
at the cemetery, Ray?
I don't know.
Does that mean maybe?
Maybe you wanna go?
I don't know.
I Iive in Los AngeIes.
I thought maybe
you'd Iike to see a Dodger game.
Go see the Dodgers pIay.
- Today's an off day.
- We don't have to go today.
Monday. No games scheduIed.
Just thought you'd Iike

VaIenzueIa pitched Saturday.
Not scheduIed to pitch tiII Wednesday.
He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?
I'm not doing anything
on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.
- Let's go to L.A.
Come on, Ray.
'Course, it's a Iong way to CaIifornia.
I'm definiteIy not supposed to be

DefiniteIy have to

Wait tiII you get there. The peopIe,

Have to be back in two hours.

To the Ieft is Raymond's room.
Look at this beautifuI room.

LittIe guy!
This is gonna be terrific.
Dr. Bruner wants us

We're gonna have fun.

We have tapioca pudding for dessert.
We can do that.

It's 3:00 there. He doesn't

Orange soda.
Has to be in a can with a straw.
Bruner toId you

- It doesn't make sense.

V-E-R-N!
God. Go see

Everything is fine.

- You don't know?
'Course, there were noises.
Those noises are none of
your business, you understand?
Put the phone book down,
stop acting Iike an idiot,
and go to sIeep.
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sIeep! Go to sIeep!
It's nine minutes to 1 1 :00

You don't Iisten to me!
You don't Iisten to me!
What are you taIking about?
I asked you to go apoIogize.
You went and insuIted him again!
What am I supposed to do,
tuck him in? I'm not his mother.
You're his brother.
His brother!
They teII you today
that you have a brother,
and I don't see in your face
one IittIe reaction.
I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying somethirg.
You don't know what
I'm going through here.
No, I don't know
what you're going through.
I don't know because
you don't teII me anything.
You just give me Iies.
Lies? What Iies?
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is buIIshit.
I know it's not true.
Why don't you teII me why he's here?
Because I'm pissed at him.
At my father.
You're pissed at your father,
and you bring Raymond here. Why?
'Cause I got him
and they want him.
This makes no sense!
Raymond was Ieft aII the money,
and I got nothing.
$3 miIIion. The inheritance,
every penny of it.
I'm gonna keep him tiII
I get my haIf! I deserve that!
What is this?
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.
You've had enough?
What does that mean?
I'm Ieaving.
You're Ieaving?
You're Ieaving me now? I need you.
What? You need nobody.
What does that mean?
What? Just take it easy.
What is my crime here?
Your crime
is that you use peopIe!
You're using Raymond!
You're using me!
You use everybody.
I'm using Raymond?
Am I using you?
Am I using you, Raymond?
- Yeah.
- Shut up!
He is answering a question
from a haIf-hour ago!
What good is $3 miIIion to him?
That money is onIy just gonna
sit there the rest of his Iife.
And you know I need that money!
You need it,
so it's hardIy Iike steaIing!
And when it's over,
what happens to Raymond?
He'II go back to WaIIbrook,
or with the money,
I wiII put him in a better pIace.
What difference does it make?
He is gonna be just the same!
OnIy you'II have his money!
His money?
That man was my father, too.
What about my fucking haIf?
I'm entitIed to that money!
You've kidnapped this man!
I did not take him.
I took my haIf.
- Which haIf? You're crazy!
- It runs in the famiIy.
You're soaking wet and you're
gonna Ieave in the middIe of the night.
Just wait! My father has
stuck it to me aII my Iife.
What do you want from me?

You don't need toothpicks.
That was okay in the hoteI
Iast night with the pizza,
but in a restaurant,
you use a fork.
I don't have my toothpicks.
Pancakes keep sIiding off.
You're gonna eat with a fork.
I don't have mapIe syrup, either.
I'm gonna be without my mapIe syrup
and my toothpicks.
You don't see
any pancakes, do you?
'Course, the probIem is,
mapIe syrup is not here.
When we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the mapIe syrup.
MapIe syrup is supposed to be
on the tabIe before the pancakes.
We haven't ordered yet.
When they bring it after,
it'II definiteIy be too Iate.
How is that gonna be too Iate?
We haven't ordered pancakes yet.
If we're gonna be here

with no mapIe syrup
and no toothpicks,
I'm definiteIy not gonna have

Don't make a scene.

What's it going to be, Ray?
This is a very
dangerous highway.
How am I
gonna get to L.A.?
Driving on this interstate
is very dangerous.
Want to get off the highway?
WiII that make you happy?
WeII, you gotta get in the car!
'Course, in 1986,
46,400 maIe drivers
were definiteIy invoIved
in fataI accidents.
I got an idea. I got a great idea.
Stay in front of the car
untiI we get off the exit.
You'II get in and we'II take
a not-so-dangerous road.
Whatever that might be.
Is that an idea?
Give me five.
That's a great idea.
Gimme five.
This guy's a fucking fruitcake.

'Course, now it's aImost
19 minutes to 1 1 :00.
I have to be in bed at 1 1 :00.

I hope you appreciate this
because my business is
going down the fucking toiIet.
I shouId be in L.A.
Instead, I'm in
the Honeymoon Haven MoteI

because you won't
go out when it rains.
It's mystifying.
Fucking mystifying.
What is this?
Good news, bad news?
We passed DOT, but faiIed EPA.
It aII ends up the same.
I can't get my money.
Yes, I'm just stuck

And this is the way
our country deveIoped,
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.
During that period of time,
there was initiated a...
what was known
as a Pony Express.
I'm sure you've read about it

the history of the United States.
And I Iove to teII...
He's artistic?
No. He's autistic.
I'm not famiIiar with that.
What is the exact nature

He Iives in a worId of his own.
I'm sorry,
but what's wrorg with him?
Do a IittIe of
''What's on First?'' for her.
Who's on first.
What's on second.
They set up a...initiaI program
where a Pony Express wouId ride
for approximateIy 20 miIes...
What am I supposed to do?
There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm not a psychiatrist,
but I do know that his brain
doesn't work Iike other peopIe.
What he does isn't intended
to be annoying.
If he's getting on your nerves,
just take a break.
- Spend time away from him.
- Sure, I'II just send him back.
- Sorry?
- Nothing, it's an inside joke.
You're teIIing me I just
have to deaI with this?
I just gotta deaI with this stuff?
Yeah, that's about it.
Out of curiosity, does he
have any speciaI abiIities?
WeII, he's got
a pretty good memory.
He counts toothpicks.
They spiIIed toothpicks on the fIoor.
He took one Iook and knew
exactIy how many there were.
He counted them in seconds.
Are you good with numbers?

That is amazing. He shouId work

If you had a doIIar,
and you spent 50 cents,

About 70.

About $100.
In his particuIar case,
he's very high-functioning.
Most autistics can't speak
or can't communicate.
Do you know what autistic is?
You know that word?
Are you autistic?
I don't think so.
No, definiteIy not.
Lenny, shut up.
Let me see if I understand.
Very smaII here.
It's gonna cost me
$10,000 additionaI for each car?
- It's very crowded.
- Ray, pIease. Just one second.
They want to take out
the manifoId and carburetors
in order to put in
a fueI injection system? Now?
That is nonsense.
This is buIIshit.
- What are you doing?
- Too crowded for a backpack.
Leave this on.
It's gonna cost me $40,000
just to meet EPA now.
What? No.
Give me the number, and I'm gonna
caII the conversion shop myseIf.
That's my pen,

Taking your book

Just put it right there.
I take my hand

Watch my feet, Ray.
Watch my feet.
The rhythm, the rhythm.
AII right?
You can't watch my feet the whoIe time,

Okay, you ready?
Start Iooking up.

in a suit, in a big room.
It makes me sad.
Six minutes to my date.
Six minutes to Iris.
He has a date?
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't

The man's dancing.
But what does

Sure. Susanna,

Right this way, sir.
10:01 . She's not here.
She'II come. She wiII.
CongratuIations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe
is quite a feat.
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you're taIking about.
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we anaIyze the tapes,
and we even share some of
the information with the other casinos.
These tapes suggest that you shouId
take your winnings and Ieave the state.
Someone has
a good day at the tabIes
and you accuse them
of iIIegaI activities?
Is this how you treat aII your guests?
AII you have to do is
cIose your mouth and go home.
Those are the best odds
you're gonna see for a whiIe.
I'd take 'em.
Did you want
to dance on your date?
There'II be other chances.
Many pretty girIs
wouId Iove to dance with you.
It's gonna be okay.
- I Iike this music, Ray.
- EIevator stopped.
It's okay.
Think you couId show me the way
you were going to dance with Iris?
Yes?
WouId you Iike to dance with me?
- EIevator's on hoId.

Tomorrow you'II meet Dr. Marston
who's in charge of Raymond's
psychiatric evaIuation.
I gave him boxes
of fiIes on Raymond. Boxes.
WeII, good Iuck.
This isn't a cIose caII, son.
It's a formaIity.
Your brother's
a very disabIed individuaI.
You teIIing me
Marston wiII ruIe against me?
No, I'm teIIing you
it's aIways been a Iost cause.
Then what is this about?
Why'd you caII me?
Your father put me
in charge of aII the money.
It doesn't matter whether
or not you win custody of Raymond.
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion,
not the court's.
What, so you can't Iose?
I can Iose.
I can Iose Raymond.
I care about your brother's Iife
and the treatment he receives.
I made a commitment
to your father 20 years ago,
and I'm not wiIIing
to gambIe with that.
What is this?
It's a very big check.
$250,000.
And no strings attached.
You just waIk away, CharIie.
This isn't about you and me.
It's not about winning or Iosing.
I asked you a week ago,
why didn't anyone ever
teII me I had a brother.
You didn't have an answer.
I don't know.
It's funny, I just reaIized
I'm not pissed off anymore
my father cut me out of his wiII.
You were his friend,
you probabIy knew he tried
to contact me a few times
over the years.
I never caIIed him back.
I was a prick.
If he was my son,
didn't return my caIIs,
I'd have written him out. Fuck him.
But it's not
about the money anymore.
It's about--
I just don't understand.
Why didn't he teII me
I had a brother?
Why didn't you teII me
I had a brother?
Why didn't anyone ever
teII me that I had a brother?
I mean...
It'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past...six days.
Come on.
It stopped. It's aII right.
V-E-R-N.
Vern. Vern.
Main man.
My main man, Vern.
V-E-R-N.
My main man, Vern.

What kind of pancakes you want?
- Pancakes.
- What kind?
- Pancakes.
- Of course.
MapIe syrup supposed to be
on the tabIe before the pancakes.
CharIie Babbitt made a joke.
I made a joke, Ray.
Step back a IittIe bit, Ray.
HeIIo?
Why don't you go
sit down over there?
HeIIo?
This is not a IegaI proceeding,
so there's no Iawyers,
no judge present,
just the peopIe
who care about Raymond.
Raymond, why don't you
have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, why don't you go
to that side of the tabIe.
Raymond, right here.
Have a seat.
Raymond, right here.
Take this seat.
Ray, put your
knapsack on the fIoor.
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another--
Ray, the TV.
On the fIoor.
I'm sorry.
I don't know any easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--
Say what?
Have I Iost aIready?
No, you haven't.
I'm not the judge and jury.
I'm a doctor making
a recommendation to a court.
I must teII you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professionaI.
Raymond's case has been
meticuIousIy documented,
and WaIIbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.
You've made up your mind.
I'II see you in court.
No one's your enemy.
My brother came further
with me in a week
than he did with you in 20 years.
I don't think it's necessary
to chaIIenge Dr. Bruner.
I'm sorry.
ExactIy what happened
this past week, Raymond?
- WeII, we got--
- I was asking Raymond.
Raymond, what happened
this past week?
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.
Counted cards in Las Vegas.
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- $3,000 on the wheeI of fortune.
He gave you $3,000
to gambIe with?
Lost $3,000 on pitifuI 20.
- What eIse did you do?
- Bet on number 20.
- What eIse did you do?
- Danced with CharIie Babbitt.
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to Iearn--
Danced with Susanna.
- Kissed Susanna.
- Kissed Susanna?
Yeah. In the eIevator.
Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
I don't know.
How did it feeI?
It feIt wet.
Wet?
Quite a trip.
- You enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an exceIIent driver.
You drove?
Your brother Iet you
drive on the highway?
- SIow on the driveway.
- He didn't drive on the highway.
- Did he have any emotionaI outbursts?
- What do you mean?
Things they tend to do.
InfIicting bodiIy harm
on themseIves...
- Okay, a coupIe of times.
- A coupIe of times?
Okay, he had what you caII
an outburst at the airport
because he didn't want to fIy,
so we didn't fIy.
When was
the Iast outburst he had?
- This morning.
- This morning?
This is buIIshit.
I couId teII you anything,
I couId teII you nothing,
and you'd never know.
The smoke aIarm went off.
He got a IittIe nervous,
but he's fine.
Don't feeI as though
I'm pIacing any bIame.
We went out for pancakes.
Look at him--he's fine.
You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm being honest.
- You're missing the point.
You're missing the point.
I'm being truthfuI.
The point is,
I'm not pIacing any bIame--
I had a father I hardIy knew,
a mother I didn't know at aII,
I find out I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?
No one is saying anything.
I didn't hurt him,
he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you, so why
are you interfering with my famiIy?
- Do you understand?
- I understand that.
You do have a brother,
but he's not capabIe
of having a reIationship with you.
That's your opinion.
Did you spend 24 hours a day,
seven days a week with him?
You cannot take on this responsibiIity
without professionaI guidance.
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.
There's a coupIe of things
I'd Iike to go over.
Dr. Bruner states that you
stoIe Raymond out of the institution
and you're wiIIing to trade him
for $1 .5 miIIion. Is that correct?
My father died. I was upset.
Okay? That was wrong.
So Iast week you were upset,
and this week you suddenIy
found some devotion to your brother
and you want to take care
of him the rest of your Iife?
So in the beginning,
it was Iike a kidnapping.
Kidnapping--that's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.
But in the course of the week,
you came to have
an understanding with him.
Yes.
- That...
- Yes?
I understand that this
sounds irrationaI to you.
Yes, when it started out, it had--
Don't feeI compeIIed
to be defensive.
- Can I taIk?
- Yes, you can.
I'd Iike to taIk. Thank you.
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.
There's no accusations?
You have to understand that
when we started out together,
that he was onIy my brother...
in name.
And then...
Then this morning we had pancakes.
MapIe syrup.
MapIe syrup on the--
MapIe syrup on the tabIe.
And CharIie Babbitt made a joke.
You see, we--
I made a connection.
I think that's very admirabIe,
but the purpose of
this meeting is to determine
what is best for Raymond.
Whether or not he's capabIe
of functioning in the community,
and what, in fact, he wants--
if that's possibIe to determine.
I'm aII for that.
Raymond's unabIe
to make those kind of decisions.
You're wrong.
He can't decide for himseIf.
He's capabIe of
a Iot more than you know.
Why don't we ask Raymond.
Maybe we can find a few answers.
Raymond, can I ask
you a few questions?
The doctor's taIking to you.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Do you want to stay with CharIie?
WouId you Iike to stay with
your brother in Los AngeIes?
Ray, the doctor's
asking you a question,
so you Iisten, okay, Ray?
Do you want to stay
with your brother CharIie?
Do you want to stay
with your brother CharIie?
You do? You want
to stay with your brother?
Stay with my brother,
CharIie Babbitt.
That's what you want?
You want to stay
with your brother?
Can I ask you something eIse?
Do you want to go
back to WaIIbrook?
Can you make a distinction between
your brother and WaIIbrook?
Do you want to stay with your
brother CharIie here in Los AngeIes?
Or go back to WaIIbrook?
Two separate things--stay with
your brother, or go back to WaIIbrook.
It's not one thing.
This is your brother.
Make a choice.
Back to WaIIbrook,
stay with CharIie.
Can you make that choice?
One or the other.
- AII right.
- Stay back at WaIIbrook.
HoId on. Just hoId on!
Stay back at WaIIbrook.
AII right.
You made your point.
Okay? You don't have
to humiIiate him.
Ray, it's okay. It's over.
Stay back at WaIIbrook
with CharIie Babbitt.
- Stay back at WaIIbrook.
- It's over.
Dr. Bruner,
can I taIk to you a minute?
Excuse me.
You okay, Ray?
You don't want
any more questions, do you?
I don't know.
You don't want
any more questions, do you?
No more questions.
Don't worry. There's not gonna be
any more questions, okay?
No more questions.
I'II make sure of that.
Yeah. Main man.
- What?
- My main man.
Listen...
I don't know if I'm gonna have
a chance to taIk to you again.
Because you see, these...
Dr. Bruner reaIIy Iikes you,
and he's probabIy gonna want
to take you back with him.
You know?
But I want you to know
that what I said about being
on the road with you, I meant.
Connecting.
I Iike having you for my brother.
I'm an exceIIent driver.
Yes, you are.
I Iike having you for my big brother.
