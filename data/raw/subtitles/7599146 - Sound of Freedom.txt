<font color="#ffff54">Hello. I’m Giselle.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I heard you singing
in the market.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Remember?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Wow...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You’re even prettier
than I remember.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Is your daddy home?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">OK. OK.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Mister Aguilar?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Giselle.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Founder of “Discover
Your Dreams”.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Nice to meet you.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I’d love to steal five
minutes of your time.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I believe Rocio may have the talent
to be in the entertainment business.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">But of course,</font>
<font color="#ffff54">you’d need to bring her to
our annual audition tomorrow.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">If I were you, I’d convince him.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">And who is this cutie?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Is he your little brother?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">What’s your name?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No stage-fathers allowed.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">But pick-up is at 7 p.m. Sharp.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">- Okay.
- Bye, daddy.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Bye, sweetie.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Give me a hug.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">See you later, okay?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Take good care of them.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Don’t worry.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yeah. Let’s see a cute smile.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s fix something.
Your hair like this.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yeah, you look like a star.</font>
He's in.
He's uploading.
If he logs out
we can kiss the max
sentence goodbye.
It's messed up world, man.
You know, I've been to a lot
of murder scenes.
This shit's different.
Like, as soon as I lay down
all I see are those kids faces.
I don't think I can
do this job. Tim.
Let me ask you something.
How many pedophiles, you caught?
As of today,
288, not so bad.
How many kids you found?
It is a high probability
that most of those kids are
outside of the US, Chris.
So our job,
is to get the pedophiles.
And that's it?
It's a messed up world, right
Hello, Mr. Oshinsky
I'm Agent Ballard.
I'm in charge of your case.
Everybody's gone
home for the weekend,
So it's just the two of us.
How about we grab
some fresh air?
Come on, put your shoes on.
I really feel
connected to you.
Like maybe you'll understand.
But I need to know.
Can I trust you?
See, part of my job,
is looking
at everything.
You tell me how I'm
supposed to gaze
at so much beauty,
without...
being drawn to it?
Without wanting it.
You want me to believe
you're one of us?
You think I'm that stupid?
"Only the courageous act.
The rest are tyrannized
by a legal system,
made by cowardly men
who cannot admit
their true desires."
End quote.
So what?
You read my book.
I studied your book
Daddy's home!
Okay, everybody. Come on.
You gotta clear your plates now.
You're gonna be late.
Let's go. Come on.
Are you okay?
Come on, Tim.
What's going on?
Just give me a week,
please.
That's all I'm asking.
One week.
Mr. Oshinsky...
Time to go home.
Bottom line, they've got you.
20 to 30, conservative.
But here's the thing...
Whatever they build
up against you...
I'll knock down.
That's my job.
But...
here's the thing I need...
I need a real one.
I don't act on my fantasies.
What about that trip
you took last year?
The one out of Cartagena?
The "Butterfly Cruise".
Come on.
I need this, my friend.
Almost as bad as you do.
But I already have three copies.
Not like this.
There's an inscription
on the inside.
Just for you.
"To the bravest man I know.
Though I didn't know
it at the time."
So Sweet.
Flip the page.
His name is Teddy Bear.
My God, he's so little.
Yeah.
This time tomorrow,
that little boy
is gonna be yours for
the whole weekend.
"Better a millstone
be hung around your neck
and you be cast into the sea
than that you should
ever hurt for one of
these little ones."
What does that mean?
You're under arrest for
crimes against children.

Line six.
Is there some kind
of problem officer?
Oh, yeah, that...
that's an old picture.
You know kids are these days.
They just grow up so fast.
That's him.
No, no, no, I'm his uncle.
I'm his uncle, you just ask him
<font color="#ffff54">Hello.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">What’s your name?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Teddy Bear.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No, not that name.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Your real name.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Miguel.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Miguel Aguilar.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Nice to meet you, Miguel.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Come with me.</font>
Why don't you go
right over there?
Okay?
He has lacerations
consistent with sexual abuse.
It's only three
or four days old.
<font color="#ffff54">That’s a Mustang.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">That’s a very fast car.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I’m hungry.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Wanna get a burger?</font>
 <font color="#ffff54">Let me guess.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You’re seven and a half.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Is it April?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No. It’s July. July 12. Why?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Then I’m eight.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I’ve got a son just your age.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">His name’s Kalen.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">And I’m Tim.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Tim Ballard.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">But you can call me Timoteo.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Timoteo?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">That’s my name in
Spanish, right?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">It has your name on it.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">My sister gave it to me.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You rescue children, right?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Maybe you can help me find her.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Where is your sister?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">The beach is the perfect
spot for a photo shoot.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You like the beach, right?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Simba? What’s wrong?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">My name is not Simba.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Well… From now on, it is.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Ma’am? But my papa doesn’t know.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Your papa knows.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">On your feet. Come
down, come down.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Go.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Go, go. Go inside!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No! Where are you taking
us? Please, take us home!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Shut up or you’ll get a beating.</font>
Help us, please. <font color="#ffff54">No,
please! Help us, please.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Help! Please!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Help! Please!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Get us out of here!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">And where did they take you?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">What do you see?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Four men.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Are they nice men?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Why are you giving me
this? Dad gave it to you.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">It’s yours now. Don’t lose it.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Stand up! Get in a line! Now!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Stand up! Come here!
In line, standing up.</font>
They're ready Amigo, you pick.
That one there.
Okay.
No! No! No!
<font color="#ffff54">- Come.
- No.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">- Don’t take him! No!
- Come, come, come!</font>
These are good for
when he wake up.
Alright now, Fuego.
Don't party too much.
<font color="#ffff54">Want another one?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Here’s the deal:</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I can help you, but you
need to help me too.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">If you don’t help me,</font>
<font color="#ffff54">the bad men...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">will find out and they
will kill your sister.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No, no, don’t worry.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Just do what I say,</font>
<font color="#ffff54">and your sister will be fine.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Promise me you’ll do
whatever I tell you.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Okay?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Come on, eat, eat up.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Eat, eat.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Ever flown in an airplane?</font>
No? <font color="#ffff54">No?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Captain Miguel, with the stars.</font>
You gonna love it.
You just gonna really love it.
<font color="#ffff54">Teddy Bear.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Do you like it?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">“Teddy Bear.”</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Teddy Bear. I like it. We’re
gonna call you Teddy Bear.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">How long you were with her?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">A week? A month?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">A long time...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Mister Timoteo?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Will they hurt my sister now?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I promise...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">they will never find
out what you told me.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I promise.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">We don’t know for certain,</font>
<font color="#ffff54">but we think he spent about...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">three months in Tijuana.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You’re a father.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">May I?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Could you sleep at night knowing
that one of your children’s beds...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">is empty?</font>
She's just Miranda's age.
Imagine walking into
her room right now...
Seeing an empty bed.
What would we do?
<font color="#ffff54">Please keep this.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No, it’s yours.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Please.</font>
You're gonna rot in jail, Earl,
the only question is which one?
And normally I'd
extradite your ass
straight to Colombia.
There you'd be raped every day,
have your balls cut off.
Which quite frankly you deserve.
Or you can tell me
what I need to know,
and stay in the U.S.
Get this to our embassy
in Columbia as soon as
possible and set me up
for another call with
the national police.
Got it.
Captain Jorge? I'm good,
thank you. Hey, I...
♪ na, na, na, na ♪
♪ na, na, na, na
♪ na, na, na...
Rocio Aguilar.
The boy's sister.
Now pull-up on the
reins here, son...
we're going to hand this
case to the prosecution,
and we're gonna let the
Colombians mop-up Colombia.
Which means she'll
disappear, sir.
For good.
We're Homeland Security,
you know we can't
go off rescuing
Honduran kids in Colombia.
Look, the boy's back
with his father...
that's a career-capper,
take it and move on.
I can't.
I don't...
think you understand
what I'm asking you.
See ah...
This job tears you to pieces.
And this is...
my one chance to put those
pieces back together.
I suppose I could
tell DC that you're...
You're going down there to
have a "training seminar".
Fund it out of discretionary.
Keep it under ten grand.
Honey...
Hey...
Welcome to Cartagena.
Mucho gusto. <font color="#ffff54">Nice to meet you.</font>
So, I took the liberty
of sending your report
to a "non-police" type.
And he came back with a lead.
Welcome to his office.
<font color="#ffff54">Hey, Mami! Keep an
eye on my Ferrari.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Okay.</font>
There are two things you
should know about Vampiro.
He ran the Cali cartel's
money-laundering operations
in the nineties.
He did time in prison.
And the second thing:
He buys children.
And then he sets them free.
He puts these kids
in safe houses.
He gives them a
new chance at life.
Vampiro!
Some ground-rules, Timoteo.
Don't ever step into my
office again looking like
you just walked
out of a friggin'
Banana Republic ad.
Hm?
Save that for Bogotá, man.
This is Cartagena.
It's a beach town, a party town.
Lighten up.
Jorge,
guy's down here looking
for a little pedo-action,
what's he wear?
Chancletas, flip-flops, T-shirt.
Exactly. What I need to see
is some horny hung-over
rich American,
stinking of beer,
crawling out of a big
honking automobile.
Rent something obnoxious.
And black.
And now Timoteo, the kid.
Miguel.
He's back with his father, huh?
Yes.
How did that make you feel?
Giving a child his freedom?
Felt good.
Like, "back-rub" good,
or "chicken-wings" good?
What kind of good are
we talking about here?
The kind that gives hope.
Come on, amigo.
You've been at
this for 12 years.
Why are you doing it?
Because God's children
are not for sale.
That is why I am giving
you my Friday night.
And the plan unfolds.
Now the sister, the pretty one,
What's her name?
Rocio.
As of this moment,
she could be a
block down the road,
or she could be in
Moscow, Bangkok, L.A.
And yes,
I do know an young
attractive woman
who matches your "Giselle".
Major operator,
runs 10, 15 kids.
Sources her children
out of Central America,
so she doesn't have to deal
with the Colombian cops.
Lures them in with her looks,
promises the sun and the moon...
a month later,
they're turning five,
six tricks a night.
You got a photo?
That's the easy part.
Meet Miss Cartagena.
A verifiable beauty queen.
Her name's Katty Juarez.
She's clean,
not even a parking ticket
in the colonial area.
No record of leaving
Colombia since she was 12.
Set me up on a date.
Tell Miss Cartagena
you got a horny,
hung-over, rich, American
looking for a
little pedo-action.
You don't just set up a
date with Katty Juarez.
She only deals with
street traffickers,
people she knows, old friends.
She keeps her nails very clean.
That is a tough marlin to hook.
AMERICAN EXECUTIVE RAN
CHILD SEX CLUB IN THAILAND
Guy was making close to a
quarter million a month.
You said that Katie has about
15-20 kids, right? <font color="#ffff54">Who’s this?</font>
Scattered all over Cartagena?
Probably some in Cali, Medellin?
Timoteo?
So Rocio could be anywhere.
But what if we needed
all those kids?
I don't understand, amigo.
<font color="#ffff54">I don’t understand, amigo.</font>
You ever heard of Club Bangkok?
It's a members-only club
full of rich perverts,
jet-setters, CEO's. It's
a high-end facility,
stocked 24/7 with
a hundred kids.
And who supplied them?
A bunch of sex traffickers
who got greedy.
If they can build one in Bangkok
why can't we build one here?
You wanna build a
high-end sex hotel?
Yes I do.
And I found just
the right investor.
Pablo Delgado... runs
a four billion dollar
real estate development
company, with holdings
all over the world.
He loves to play cop.
We've already used him
on two separate missions,
he eats this stuff up.
That's the look, my friend.
And he can build a sex hotel
anywhere he wants.
You know someone who can
bring a deal like this
to the marketplace?
Hello, pretty. <font color="#ffff54">Hi,
love.</font> <font color="#ffff54">Hello, pretty.</font>
Calacas! <font color="#ffff54">Calacas!</font>
Vampiro! <font color="#ffff54">Vampiro!</font>
Where is your horny friend?
Change of plans.
Put on a bow tie.
We're going to the
classy part of town.
<font color="#ffff54">This is sweet.</font>
Like the old days.
Wow! This guy
knows how to party.
That's it, amigo.
No more aguardiente.
I think I may have
to expand your mind
to an entirely new reality.
Okay.
These gentlemen want to build
a one of a kind,
members-only club
near Cartagena.
Annual fee:
one hundred grand per member.
They take care of the facility
we take care of the talent.
And the members,
they get a world-class resort
with full access
to models, 24/7,
all-you-can-eat.
Live-in models. Young ones.
How young?
Shock me.
Which one is this?
El Calacas.
He used to deliver
escorts for Escobar.
He sold me a chicken last year,
9 years old.
And she was...
Nine legit or a 15
year-old with pigtails?
I deal in pure cocaine, papi...
So how many chickens
do you want?
For starters,
50 or 60.
Minimum.
Go big or go home. Right?
I think your amigo ate the worm.
I think he just sobered up.
That's a lot of chickens, papi.
No one can do that alone.
I'm not asking you if
you can do it alone.
I'm just asking
if you can do it.
plus five support agents
for a month in-country,
the penthouse in Bogota,
the mansion in
Cartagena, on and on,
and yet somehow...
somehow, you have
failed to bring me
one real-world lead,
or one American child, or
one American trafficker,
or one reason DC would
let you within a million
miles of this, and a
bunch of glamor shots
of Miss Cartagena don't count!
She has the girl.
And I say the girl is in Russia.
Prove me wrong.
It's over, Tim.
Close up,
get on a plane and
come back home.
Bureaucracy is shit.
This is why I operate black.
Have a nice flight, Timoteo.
You were a cartel guy...
Yeah.
Kept your mouth
shut, did your time.
Could've picked up
where you left off,
bought yourself a
condo on the beach.
Instead you're
doing this. Why?
Really?
I had that condo on the beach.
Fifteenth floor,
marble everything,
overlooking the whole bay.
First night out of jail
I slept in my own bed.
Day two, I was back in business,
same old life.
But it doesn't feel right...
not the drugs, not the hookers.
But dammit if I
didn't keep trying...
So one night
I'm leaving a bar
all jacked up on coca
and I notice this young
girl on the corner.
Fine looking, maybe 20, 25.
I take her up to my place,
do the deed, pay the bill.
She's putting on her shoes,
and I notice something.
I notice her foot.
She's got these little
pink cat faces painted
on her toenails.
And it hit me.
She's not 25.
Then she glances up
and our eyes connect.
And
it was like I was granted
a glimpse into her soul,
and all I saw was sadness...
Out of nowhere she
starts talking.
Turns out she's not
25. Not even 20.
This girl is 14
years old, Timoteo.
She's been doing this
since she was six.
Looks at me,
smiles,
takes the money,
walks out the door.
All of a sudden I'm
hit by this tidal wave,
this tsunami of darkness,
and I know
I'm the sadness
in her eyes. Me.
I'm the darkness.
And I know
the darkness has to die.
So I get my 45.
Put it to my head.
Put my finger on the trigger.
Now if there's a time
to ask if God exists,
that would be it.
So I did.
When God tells you what to do,
you cannot hesitate.
So you've thought of that...
of doing it on your own?
I won't be on my own.
I just have to convince Pablo.
Okay.
So you quit your job
and you go and
rescue these kids.
My resignation's in your box.
Wait. You do realize
you're ten months away
from vesting your pension.
I do.
You know I did
everything I could,
but the law is the law.
Did you know that
were over 22 million
new images of child pornography
on the web this past year?
That's a five thousand percent
increase over the
past five years.
Five thousand percent.
The fact is
it is the fastest growing
international crime network
that the world has ever seen.
I agreed to it because
we were working
with the U.S. government.
If you back out now this
whole thing will blow!
It has already passed
the illegal arms trade.
And soon it's gonna
pass the drug trade.
You Wanna know why?
Because you can sell a
bag of cocaine one time.
But a child, the most
precious child...
You can sell a five year-old kid
five to ten times a day
for ten years straight!
And everyday ordinary people
don't want to hear it,
it's too ugly for
polite conversation,
but meanwhile over two
million children a year
are being sucked into the
deepest recesses of hell.
Trust me, man.
If we do nothing,
their pain is gonna
spread and spread
till some day it's gonna
reach the likes of you.
And that will be a nightmare
that you never
gonna wake up from.
I'm sorry.
Sir, the gentleman who just left
asked me to give you this.
Jorge found us a property
on Cartagena Bay.
It's a private
island confiscated
by the Colombian government.
Here's some intel on that.
The palapa will be located here.
The traffickers will
arrive up here...
So what do you think?
2.6 Not bad, huh?
So let's go meet him in Bogota
and get him excited.
<font color="#ffff54">My love…</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Pablo Delgado. Nice to meet you.</font>
Better?
Too stiff.
If you don't know what
to say, <font color="#ffff54">Loosen up!</font>
Just don't say anything at all.
Silence.
Don't forget to smile.
I forgot.
<font color="#ffff54">Loosen up! Loosen up!</font>
My love... <font color="#ffff54">My love…</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Pablo Delgado. A pleasure.</font>
Yeah. I don't know
about the kiss.
Welcome. Beware of your heads.
<font color="#ffff54">Welcome. Beware of your heads.</font>
My soul brother, let me
introduce Katty. <font color="#ffff54">My soul brother,</font>
Katty, this is the
man that's gonna make
your dreams come true. Pablo.
<font color="#ffff54">A pleasure.</font>
Gentlemen...
Adolfo.
Adolfo.
Don Fuego.
Don Fuego.
You know El Calacas.
Extravagant. <font color="#ffff54">Extravagant.</font>
Who would like a drink?
We've got fourteen members
showing up for the
"Kick-Off Party," plus
a dozen prospects.
And we would like all
our talent on site,
rested, tested and ready to rock
the day before the
first guest arrives.
Absolutely.
So
How many can you deliver?
You asked for 50.
At least that,
more if you're lucky.
Tell me, amor...
What do you like?
Depends on the mood.
<font color="#ffff54">The pretty boy is horny!</font>
Just deliver no
less than 50 models.
And you will leave the island...
with 100 grand
Cheers. <font color="#ffff54">Cheers, hermanos.</font>
Cheers. <font color="#ffff54">Cheers.</font>
Cheers.
Ok, it's handled...
you have the support of
our Embassy in Colombia,
One of our guys
will track the raid
in case you need
any legal back-up.
Hey Tim,
I hope you find her.
 <font color="#ffff54">For you, papi.</font>
Gracias. <font color="#ffff54">Gracias.</font>
Negotiation is over there.
I want the kids back here,
as far away from the
traffickers as possible...
They didn't bring all the kids.
It doesn't surprise me.
It gotta be less than 30.
Let's go. Quick, so you
don't get wet. <font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Quick, so you don’t get wet.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Remember, it’s a party.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">This is beautiful.</font>
You keeping the
rest of the talent
in the glove compartment?
They'll be here soon.
<font color="#ffff54">I died...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">and went to heaven.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">This is a paradise.</font>
Osorio Rodriguez.
<font color="#ffff54">Osorio Rodriguez.</font>
But my friends call me Carne.
Carne is our lawyer.
He got good friends
at the borders.
<font color="#ffff54">He’s our Don King, papi.</font>
No, no, no, no, no.
No Don King.
I like to get in the ring.
<font color="#ffff54">Get happy. Cheer up, cheer up.</font>
Tenacious. Love him.
That's it.
<font color="#ffff54">Excuse me. Want more?</font>
Excuse me. Want more?
And what's plan B?
We wait.
We're not gonna lose the
kids in the other boat.
Rocio must be with them.
Jorge, listen to me.
When you land,
take their fat bulldog and
get him off the island,
keep him separate
and no handcuffs.
No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry. He's mine.
Choose another.
You're joking, right?
You know where is the most
dangerous place in Colombia?
Between me
and my chicken.
You're a real big man, huh?
I can kill you without a glance.
<font color="#ffff54">Respect me, asshole!</font>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
<font color="#ffff54">Brother…</font>
Give the man what he wants.
Carne, tell your fathead
goon to put this gun away.
Alright.
Come on, guys.
Let's have a drink, huh?
Hey,
you'll have all afternoon
in that damn bungalow.
<font color="#ffff54">Now! Green light…</font>
Hurray! Finally arrived! <font color="#ffff54">Come.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Hurray! Finally arrived!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Come, come.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go to the party.</font>
moves! <font color="#ffff54">Stop! Hands up!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Nobody moves!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I’m victim! I’m victim!</font>
On the ground! On the
ground! <font color="#ffff54">Stop! Police!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">- On the ground! On the ground!
- Calm, calm!</font>
Who set us up?
Your Don King? <font color="#ffff54">Shut up!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Leave him with me.</font>
Fifty four kids.
Did you get their names?
Rocio?
I'm sorry, Tim.
But we rescued 54.
<font color="#ffff54">Uncuff them.</font>
Hear that?
That's the sound of freedom.
I hear it.
<font color="#ffff54">Come here.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Come here, son.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Do you know what happens
to pedophiles in cell 142?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Just ask your friend Carne.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, okay! Okay,
you asshole, okay!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Okay?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, what?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Asshole, what?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">The Scorpion.</font>
Hm.
<font color="#ffff54">Little princess...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">It’s time you make
me some real money.</font>
Fuego handed her off here.
At a village on
the Guáitara River.
South of that river,
it's all rebel territory.
No one goes in.
Not the army, not the police.
Not us.
What?
That's it?
You're talking about extracting
an 11 year-old girl
from unknown terrain.
So?
It's controlled by
an army of rebels!
Right.
Forget about what
could happen to us!
She could be killed too...
Tim.
What if this was
your daughter, Jorge.
Sorry, man. She's gone.
She got sold to the wrong guy!
Unless that guy
needs our help.
I remember hearing
about a groups
that could sweet-talk
their way into those areas.
Medical folks,
treating cholera,
malaria, dengue fever.
Makes me wonder
if there's any epidemics
going around the
mountains these days.
Put up your hand.
What?
I said "put up your hand".
These gringos. <font color="#ffff54">These gringos.</font>
Now you're a doctor.
Moving up in life.
Tim!
I got orders.
I can go as far as the river.
No further.
When you get on that water,
you're on your own.
Do me a favor.
Keep these with you.
GPS?
You can keep it in
your wallet or...
I don't know, inject it.
So you can locate
our bodies, hm?
<font color="#ffff54">Gracias.</font>
Hey, Timoteo...
If things go south tomorrow,
which is not
particularly unlikely,
there's no Marine unit coming.
We're done.
Hey.
Take this.
I'll feel safer.
I think I'll be
better off without it.
I hope we get a warm welcome.
<font color="#ffff54">We’re doctors.</font>
Don't shoot.
Don't... <font color="#ffff54">Don’t shoot.</font>
Get down! Are you
out of your mind?
<font color="#ffff54">We’re doctors. Don’t shoot.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Get down! Get down!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">We’re doctors from
the United Nations.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Down, down!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Lay down! Don’t look at me.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Doctors from the United Nations.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Shut up!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Easy, easy!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">What do they have?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Vaccines. They’re clean.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Alacran? Alacran, copy?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">It seems they’re just vaccines.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, boss.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Why the hell are
you looking at me?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Just one of you
will come with us.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Who?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Who?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">- Who’s coming?
- Easy, easy.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Me, here.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">The vaccines.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Pass them to me.</font>
Come on. <font color="#ffff54">Come on. Help him!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes. Easy.</font>
If I come back in the
dark, be ready to run.
<font color="#ffff54">What are you talking about?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Do you want your
ass full of lead?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>
What's happening?
He's on his own.
<font color="#ffff54">Boss!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Boss!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Keep moving.</font>
You got some cojones
coming here, amigo.
The cholera must be bad.
There are cases in Leticia,
San Gil, and it can
spread like wildfire.
So with your permission
I'd like to take the
rest of the evening to
look for anyone
who might need our
immediate attention.
If I do... God forbid...
we'll have to evacuate
them immediately.
It's the only way to
make sure the cholera
doesn't spread.
Evacuate?
Yes. It's just our protocol.
Yeah, yeah.
If you find sick people...
God forbid...
you bring them to me.
My protocol.
Rocio!
Rocio Aguilar!
<font color="#ffff54">I came here… I came
here to help you.</font>
Come here.
Oh, shit!
<font color="#ffff54">You need… You need…</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I need you to tell
me where you sleep.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">In which house?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Oh look.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">There you are.</font>
Is this one sick?
No, no, no. They're
fine. She's fine.
<font color="#ffff54">Come on, come on!
Get back to work.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Come on.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Take the gringo
to check my boys.</font>
Okay.
Ei, amigo. <font color="#ffff54">Ei, amigo.</font>
Let's go, man.
Rocio... Rocio. <font color="#ffff54">Rocio.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Rocio.</font>
No! No! <font color="#ffff54">No! No! No!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Take it.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Take some of this.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">This guy doesn’t know how to
play. Come on. Just take a drink.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I’m gonna check
on my little girl.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You need to do exactly
what I tell you.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Or they’ll kill us both.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Do you understand?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Why did you scream, my child?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">A bad dream.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Poor thing.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Don’t worry.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">I can make your bad dream...</font>
<font color="#ffff54">go away.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Calm down.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Calm down.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Why are you afraid?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">You know I won’t hurt you.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">That’s it.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Close your eyes.</font>
It's time to go home now.
Tu casa. <font color="#ffff54">Your home.</font>
Vamos. <font color="#ffff54">Let's go.</font>
Boss, boss... <font color="#ffff54">Boss.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Boss.</font>
Alacran, Alacran! <font color="#ffff54">Alacran.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Alacran!</font>
Checho! <font color="#ffff54">Checho!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Piranha!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Piranha, Piranha!</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yes, sir?</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Check the river.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">Yeah, yeah. They took the boat!</font>
Hey!
He's on the move.
Look.
Let's go, let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go.
<font color="#ffff54">It’s okay, it’s okay.</font>
You guys good?
You alright?
Yes
Yeah, we're fine.
<font color="#ffff54">Rocio.</font>
Rocio. Rocio.
<font color="#ffff54">Rocio.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">It’s me. Your papa.</font>
<font color="#ffff54">And your brother, Miguel.</font>
