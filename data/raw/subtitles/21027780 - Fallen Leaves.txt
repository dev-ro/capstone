It was a good movie.
It reminded me of Bresson's Memoirs of a Country Priest.

Did you like the movie?
Yeah. I laughed a lot.
Will we see each other again?

Listen, Hotari.
I'm listening.
Do you remember the night you sang karaoke?
You read well.

I am still waiting for the producer and tour manager to call.

The old man told me.
Later I met him who was younger. We were about to get married.
why didn't you She was beautiful, although she was quiet.
I lost his number.
Why don't you look in the phone book?
I don't know what his name is.

Can we get another one?
This was the sixth.
Irma!

What a small cup.
It is called an aperitif drink.

So you are an heir.

The aperitif drink is the same.
Is there anything left?
nothing.
The aperitif drink is over.
