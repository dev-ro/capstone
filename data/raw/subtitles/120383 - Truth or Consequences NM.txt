You ready?
Let's do it.
Addy.
Addy.
Addy.
Come on, Addy. Let's go.
Well, can I just wait
'til the end of this song?
Why do we have to wait 'til
the end of the song, Addy?
You're wearing a
Walkman, right?
What the fuck you think they
call it a Walkman for?
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
I'm a little edgy.
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
You wouldn't be doing
this unless you thought
it was a good idea, right?
Yeah, right.
That's enough for me.
You're my baby?
Give me a kiss.
This is our chance for
something better, right?
Let's go.
You guys got any
change for the meter?
No.
What about the quarter
you had in there?
No, that's my special quarter.
- What's so special about it?
- You wouldn't understand.
What is it, a concept
that's beyond me?
Maybe you'd understand, but
you wouldn't believe it.
Try me, Curtis.
I don't think so.
I would like to hear
the story about why
that quarter's so special.
When I looked at it... granted,
I didn't look at it closely...
but it looked like
an ordinary quarter to me.
It's not what it is, man.
It's what it represents.
Okay, fine. You wanna hear it?
The other day, this dude
was telling me a story
about some cat who flipped a
quarter up on the newsstand,
and it landed on its edge.
Now, what are the chances
of that happenin'?
Two zillion to one.
So, anyways, 'cause the
quarter lands on its edge,
this cat can read
other people's minds.
So I figure, if I can get
a quarter to land on its edge,
I can read other
people's minds too.
Hey, man, that's a old
episode of The Twilight Zone.
What?
That's The Twilight Zone,
dog. I seen that.
Well, shit, half that
stuff's true anyway.
No, it's all fiction, Curtis.
You see, Raymond, I told you
you wouldn't believe it.
You wanna know why? 'Cause
you're a bona fide skeptic.
No. I don't understand
how someone could read
people's minds just 'cause
a coin landed on its side.
I mean, come on.
Wouldn't the story be better if
the guy got hit by lightning...
or took some experimental drug
or somethin' and...
I mean, if that happened,
maybe I could buy into it.
But just a coin
landin' on its side...
It ain't my story, Addy.
Well, as I recall the story,
there was nothing special
about the coin.
Did the guy who told you
the story say there was
anything special
about the coin?
No.
Then give me the
fuckin' quarter already.
There's your fucking quarter.

Hey, I asked you a question.

You told me no one else

There wasn't supposed to be.
Come on, Raymond.
Oh, Raymond, you dumb, dumb,
dumb cocksucker.
Do you think you're

Is that what's goin' on here?
You think you're gonna
treat me like some school punk?
Shut up, Eddie.
Just shut your mouth.
Addy, get the cases.
This is how you repay me?
This is the thanks after
everything I did for you?
What did you do for me,
Eddie? Nothin'!
I did two years for you!
Two years for you!
I come out, you give me

you did for me!
Raymond, you haven't thought

Yeah, right.
Do you see what you're

You're ripping me off.
That's the easy part.
Living with what comes after
that, that's gonna be

Tell me, how far do you

Shut your mouth, Eddie.
Just shut up.
Have you seen yourself?
You should look at
yourself, 'cause you
just pissed your pants.
- Just shut your mouth.
- You pissed your pants.
- Look at me. Look at you.
- Shut the fuck up, Eddie!
- You pissed your pants.

Curtis, don't! Don't!
You said nobody was gonna

Nobody was supposed
to be there!
Somebody was there, Curtis!
Look, we had a situation arise
that we hadn't thought of,
and we dealt with it.
No, man, you dealt with it!
We didn't deal with nothin'.
All that craziness back there,
that was yours!
This was supposed to be
a simple buy, and you lied!
Okay, fine, everybody.
It was my fault.
Could we move on now?
How many drug dealers you
think there are in this state?
I don't know.
How many drug dealers are
gonna get ripped off today?
And how many of the drug dealers
that get ripped off today...
are gonna have a
fucking undercover cop
in their fucking office?
The odds gotta be
a billion to one.
I'd need a fuckin' computer
to figure it out!
Are you finished yet?
- We gotta dump the car.
- Bullshit.
She's right, Curtis!
This was my daddy's car. He
gave it to me when I was 16.
It's got a 350 bored out to 386

Slave men...
You don't know what the fuck

Why do you think every
slave who tried to book

I'll tell you why.
'Cause he didn't have a plan.
He was just goin'.
Didn't know where he was goin'.
He was just goin'.
First of all, I ain't

Good afternoon.
- How you guys doin'?
- Our car's overheatin'.
- Oh, yeah.
- You all havin' a picnic?
Yeah, that's right.
What you got there?
Oh, well, we've got
some wine and bread,
cheese, fruit
and some prosciutto.
- Prosciutto?
- It's Italian deli food.
Damn, that's ham, dog.
That's some good fuckin' ham.
So, have you got a vehicle?
Yes.
Good. What say you
give us a ride?
Well, the thing is,
we don't know you,
and I'm... I'm not sure
we're comfortable giving
a ride to strangers.

Well, let's go take a look-see.
Up we go.
Come on.
That's your car?
Hey, well, we... we'll just
have to make it work.
Come on. Show me.
What are you doin'?
We can't leave any witnesses.
No more killing, Curtis.
Look, man, I think that...
Don't think. You don't think.
That's the problem.
Look, why don't we just
take 'em with us?
We might need 'em
down the line.
That's thinking.
- You drive.
- Don't make us go with you.
What are your names?
I'm Gordon, and this is Donna.
Well, Gordon and
Donna, hop on in.
Wait a second. We're not
gonna say anything.
Gordon, right?
Come here. Next time I tell
you to do something,
you better fuckin' do
it, 'cause your life
means nothin' to me.
We're bringing you
along for protection
so we can deal later.
You cross me once, and your
life ends. You understand?
Okay, good. So, Gordon
and Donna, hop on in.
Frank, you know Alan Gryder.
Yeah, how you doin'?
So, let's have it.
A few months ago, we got word
a dealer named Eddie Grillo
was movin' up.
He recently got a new connection
that could supply him
with up to 100 keys a month.
How did we get
this information?
On a phone tap.
We were trying to find out
who Grillo was working for.
Do we know who killed him?
Yeah. Raymond Lembecke,
Addy Monroe,
Curtis Freley and Marcus Weans.
We got 'em on this
warehouse surveillance tape.
What do the police have?
Raymond Lembecke just
got out of UT State
eight months ago.
He did two years on possession.
What kind of weight?
Close to a key.
That's a lot for a
small-timer, isn't it?
It was Grillo's. Lembecke
wouldn't roll over on him.
He did his time,
and when he got out,
Grillo gives him a job
in the warehouse movin' crates.
My guess is Lembecke
felt he was owed.
Grillo wasn't givin',
so he took.
What about the girl?
Addy Monroe is Lembecke's
girlfriend. She has no priors.
Curtis Freley, on the other
hand, is as bad as they come.
He's been in the joint twice.
Once for possession and another
for assault with intent.
When he was inside, he
was Lembecke's muscle.
That's where they hooked up.
He's been in and out
of County his whole life.
His record's extensive.
You'll find it in the dockets.
And Weans?
That's where we got a problem.
Marcus Weans is one of ours.
Marcus, we gotta go!
Come on, Marcus! We gotta go!
Marcus, what are you doing?
Damn, man, can't a brother
take a piss?
Come on.
May I ask what it is
you're runnin' from?
No, you may not.
It's got something to do
with those drugs, doesn't it?
Look, man, just do what you're
told, and you'll be okay.
All they wanna do
is sell it and disappear.
- They?
- I said, "we."
No, you said, "they."
Shut the fuck up.
Know what? Turn around.
The highway is up here.
Gordon, I know where
the highway is.
Yeah.
What are you doin', Addy?
All right. I figure we got
a bad jump on this one, right?
So, right now, the highway's
crawlin' with cops.
So I'm thinkin', what
do we need to run for?
We got everything we need here.
Why don't we just head
up into the hills...
and chill out for the night,
rest, let the heat die down.
It sounds good.
Hey, Gordon!
- Gordon!
- Yeah.
Turn around!

of us is gonna end up dead.
Don't talk like that.
It's bad karma.
I'm serious, Ray.

the next couple of days.
After Vago, it'll be

something ever happened to me?
I don't know, Addy.

No, what would you do?
I don't know.

I wouldn't wanna be alive.
- Really?
- Yes, really.

Do you know how much saturated

No.

daily allowance.

So, nutritionally, you

Oh, I didn't buy it.
My grandfather left it
to me in his will.
Thought I'd take
some vacation time.
You know, drive around
the countryside.
Kind of a...
Charles Kuralt thing.
Who's Charles Kuralt?
He's the reporter
on television.
I don't watch TV.
You should watch TV, Curtis.
Then you'd know landing
a coin on its side...
won't help you to
read people's minds.
That's really funny.
Don't you think if people could
do that, we would know by now?
Absolutely not, man.
The government takes
all the people...
with supernatural powers and
sticks 'em on an island
off the coast of Florida.
I'm serious, man.
Think about it.
If I was a politician, last
thing I'd want is some fucker
who could read my mind.
See, Gordon gets it.
I see. So the people, they
just go away, and they
never come back, right?
Well, first, they say
they wanna see ya.
Spend a couple hours with you.
They wanna make sure you
got the real goods.
Once they know that,
your ass is theirs.
Then they take your car and
stick a bum in it, blow it up.
Body's unrecognizable.
Everybody you knew thinks
you're dead, but you're not.
You're on a permanent vacation
at Club Fed.
But when they say they
just wanna talk to you,
are they lying?
What have I been sayin' here?
Of course, they're lyin'.
If you can read minds, how come
you don't know they're lying?
She's quite the smart-ass?
My gal.
Gordon's not gettin'
any tonight.
She's pissed.
Go get her, cowboy.
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not okay.
We're just kiddin' around.
"Just kidding around"?
Gordon, don't you get it?
These people will tell you
a joke one minute...
and then the next,
they'll shoot you in the head.
You do not matter to them.
They're not waving their
guns at us anymore.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe they get to know us,
you know, they don't kill us.
- Gordon?
- Yeah?
Is it possible that you
admire these people?
No. Not admire.
They're gonna make more
this week than I'll make
the whole year.
I mean... I can't believe
you're saying this.
What?
A week ago, you wouldn't
have anything to do
with people like this, and now
you're trying to figure out
how to get in on their game.
I know what I'm doing.
I love you, but you don't have
a clue what you're doing.
All right, that's enough.
All right?
Let's just go back
and join the others now.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll be back in a minute.
All right.
I'm goin' to bed.
Me too.
- Good night, Ray.
- Good night.
Sweet dreams.
I'm gonna get another beer.
Marcus, you want another beer?
Yeah, man, just get me one.
- Gordo?
- Fine.
- What the fuck you doin'?
- What?
You think this is
cool, what we do?
No.
Then why you kissin'
everybody's ass?
I'm not.
See, it's people like you
that look at this life,
and you think it's got a
power, 'cause it says,
"Fuck you. I ain't gonna
take no shit off nobody."
There's an invisible line
between this world
and yours, Gordon.
But, see, you can't see that
'til you cross over that line.
And once you do, there
ain't no turnin' back.
Sorry, man.
Yo, dog, I'm gonna take this
little couple for a walk.
You know, stretch
some legs and shit.
I don't give a shit.
I'm gonna go take a piss.
- Come with me.
- Where we goin'?
Just shut up and come with me.
Protecting our families
and feeling safe in our homes.
Did you know that guns are-are
made here in America?
Give me a kiss.
65 percent of all guns
are made in America.
- That's all I get?
- That's all you get.
Wait a second.
We're not giving
you any trouble.
Why you takin' us out here?
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me.
You gotta do everything
I tell you to do.
And don't fuck with me.
Let's go.
Marcus!
Wait a second.
Shouldn't we be
with the others?
Just shut up!
Marcus!
- Marcus!
- Hey, we're over here!
Yo!
Marcus, what the fuck
are you doin' out here?
Gettin' some rest.
This is a fuckin'
rest stop, ain't it?
We gotta go. Gordon,
Donna, now. Come on!
Let's go, honey.
Honey, come on.
But I'm saying that...
I think we found ourselves
a new ride.
- Nice car.
- Thanks.
Give me the keys! Now!
Get down, get down!
Yo, yo, yo, man!
We don't need to kill him.
Says who?
Says me. This ain't
even what we're about.
Tell me what we're about.
Ray, if we don't kill him,
he's gonna tell the cops.
We're gonna tie him up.
We're gonna put him in the RV.
Jesus Christ, you guys
wanna be bad guys,
but you don't wanna
kill anybody.
Ray, I think you better really
reexamine your commitment
to your lifestyle.
Just shut the fuck up!
I said no more killing!
Now put him in the RV!
There you go. All yours.
It's the right thing to do.
What, are you getting
a conscience, Marcus?
Shit, you got one, too, Ray.
You just don't wanna admit it.
Just get him in the RV.
Come on.
State police found the motor
home at a rest stop off I-15.
They took some guy's
Suburban and locked him
inside the motor home.
Did he identify
'em as our guys?
Yes, he did.
Okay, let's get down there.
- Hey, Gordo.
- Yeah?
If you behave yourself, I'll
teach you the finer points
of armed robbery.
You ain't never gonna
feel power like walkin'
into a liquor store and sayin',
"Give me everything
you've got!"
Cool.
Shit. We got a cop.
What?
Shit!
- Come on, Ray! Move!
- Just shut up, Curtis.
- One time, just shut up.
- All right, just be cool, Ray.
- Don't tell me to be cool.
- Dispatch, three-two-three.
Code 33. Suspect vehicle:
Red and white Suburban.
Multiple suspects.
What's he doin', Ray? Come on.
Curtis, be cool, man.
- You gotta lose him, Ray.
- Pull over!
Pull over right now!
Son of a bitch.
Stop it, Curtis! Come on!
- Come on, Ray. Move!
- Just relax, Curtis!
Watch out!
Hold on!
Watch it! Fuck!
Shit!
This is 402. I'm in pursuit.
They're comin' right at you.
Come on, Curtis.
Get in the room!
Get in the room!
Get in the room!
What's going on?
Get in the room! Go on!
Get down! Get down!
Knock him out!
Come on, Ray. Hurry up.
Come on, come on!
Gordon, you drive!

Come on. Get in there.
Get in there, Donna.

Yeah. Why?
How do you know he won't kill
him the second he sees him?
Curtis does what
I tell him to do.
I don't know.
Asking Curtis not to kill...
the guy that killed
his best friend,
that's askin' a lot, Ray.

I wanna tell you that your
intelligence really shines.
I mean, every cop in the
world is looking for you,
and you lead them right to me.
Now that is brilliant.
Obviously, there's no
respect involved.
Then again, your types wouldn't
know anything about respect,
would you?
Respect is the foundation
of civilization...
and working relationships.
No offense, Tony, but you're
gettin' a little carried away
with this respect shit.
Respect is what separates us
from the niggers and the spics.
You know, when I first met you,
you had intelligence,
you had connections,
you had potential.
So, what do you do?
You get mixed up with this

Correct. What kind of business?
You bought from him.

Do you think you could come in

No. I didn't know... I didn't

Jesus Christ, Ray.
It doesn't matter

What matters is how it looks!
And it looks like
you stole from me!
Can you give me a break here?
Please, Tony.
Sorry, kid.
Mr. Vago, look, we would
never have taken this shit
if we'd known it was yours.
I swear to God.
Do you think we're crazy enough

We got all of it.
It's right here. Please,

Those were his drugs!
He wanted to kill us in there.
Would that make you happy?
No! I thought you knew
what you were doin'.
Massacre in Vegas an hour ago.
Five dead. One was Tony Vago.
Got half his face burned off
before they killed him.

telling me this is...
You're gonna love this part.

Gentlemen, may I
have your attention?
Who the hell are you?
Who I am is of no importance.
What is important is that I have
been sent here by Mr. Giannino
and his associates to deal
with the unfortunate situation
that occurred here
last evening.
We work for Mr. Vago.

You should never have hooked
up with that asshole.
He's gonna get you dead...
I don't need a fucking
lecture, Wayne, okay?
I'm past a fucking lecture
here. I need your help.
I'm not gettin'
involved in this.
Remember that guy
Cecil in New Mexico?
Raymond, did you
hear what I said?
I'm not getting
involved in this shit.
If anyone saw you come in here,
my parole is down the toilet.
Nobody saw anything.
We'll be outta here by tonight.
I need you to make one phone
call for me. One phone call.
Can you do that?
All right, Ray, one phone call,
and that's it.
Hey, Wayne.
Can I trust this guy?
How the hell should I know?

Yeah.
Thanks.
Just make this deal

You guys hit Tony Vago.
They ain't never gonna
stop looking for you.
What are you doin'?
I'm gonna go to my
girlfriend's house.
If anyone saw you come in
here, I wanna be able
to tell the cops you broke in.
I want you guys
gone by tonight.
Okay, Wayne.
Hey, Wayne.
I need your car.
This is so... This is
fuckin' unbelievable, man!
You guys come in here.
You fuckin' take over
my house, use my car!
Raymond, you wanna come with me
and fuck my girlfriend, man?
Hey, Wayne.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
So, what do you think
Vago's people are gonna do?
Vago's people don't shit
without permission
from Franco Giannino.
Giannino's one of these
old-time gangsters.
Big on vendettas.
There's no way he's gonna
sit still for this.
If they find him first...
All we're gonna be doing
is picking up body parts.
Can you give me a surveillance
on all of Giannino's shooters?
I'm on it.
Are you still mad at me?
Yeah.
Why?
Because you knew that Vago
killed Curtis's best friend...
and you still took that lunatic
in there with you.
I know. It was stupid.
But it turned out lucky.
Oh, yeah.
It's not enough we got every cop
in the country lookin' for us.
Now we have the Mob
after us too.
Yeah.
We're just blessed
with good fortune, Raymond.
I'm sorry, honey.
Right now sorry
ain't good enough.

That man is completely
psychotic.
And would you please
stop imitating him?
I'm not imitating him.
I don't condone what
they're doing, okay?
I'm just trying to understand
from their perspective
why it is they do it.
Gordon, what's happening
to you?
This is a game, Donna.
And everyone who plays
the game knows the rules.
They're the bad guys.
Cops are the good guys.
Good guys' job is
to catch them.
Bad guys' job is to
not get caught.

And Addy says she's
gonna introduce you.

What are you talkin' about?
I'm talkin' about
gettin' set up, man.
I ain't with it.
Why not?
What did Addy tell
you about this girl?
She said she was very sweet.
Nice personality, right?
The girl's supposed to have
a terrific personality.
She say what she looked like?
No, she did not, but what
difference does it make?
Go right in. Forget about it.
No, dog. See, I don't
even walk that way.
'Cause every time somebody tell
me about a girl's personality
before her looks, I know
she gonna be butt ugly.
How do you know that?
'Cause I done been through

All right. Three months ago,

This girl's supposed to

So, like an hour later,
I'm at the Beef Basket.

And in walks
the butt-ugliest woman...
I ever "seeneded" in my life.
She walks over to the table,
sits down, smiles.
- Bitch got five teeth.
- That's cold.
Brutal.
So, anyway, you know
what she orders?
Ribs.
Bitch got five teeth in her
head and she chewin' on a rib.
Chewin' ain't even
the right word, dog.
Bitch was gummin' 'em.
Right?
So, that's when I just said,
"Fuck it."
You know what I'm sayin'?
I had enough.
Cousin or not, I ain't spendin'
one more minute with this ugly,
toothless, saber-toothed
tiger-lookin',
gum-smacking bitch.
So I got up, went
to the bathroom,
"climbeded" out the window,
and booked it all the way
to the pad.
So, when Addy be talkin' about
hookin' me up with some,
like, great girl, I'm like,
ain't no fuckin' way

gonna happen to the dog.
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I done been there.
Marcus, she could've
been a wonderful girl.
Here you go.
She could've had a

Yeah, right.

How long have you known?
A couple of days.
- Does Raymond know?
- No.
- You're not gonna tell him?
- No, yeah, I'll tell him.
When?
When the time's right.
Right now he's got too
much on his mind.
You should give him
a chance to think about it.
It'll be great.
We're gonna go to
Mexico and live there.
That's a dream, Addy.
That's real.
If Raymond says we're gonna
do that, then that's
what we're gonna do.
We'll go to Mexico, buy a house
by the ocean and be a family.

No matter how often I do this,
I always love that look.
That... I'm-in-deep-

Ray... Raymond who?
Gosh, you were doin'

You were direct, to the
point, made eye contact.
Do I look stupid to you, Wayne?
No.
Then you must know that I refer
to Mr. Raymond Lembecke,
your former cell mate;
The gentleman who was
here earlier today.
I spent all last night
with my girlfriend.
I was at her house.
And somebody broke in
through my kitchen window.
I didn't know who it was
'cause I wasn't here.
Just a minute, please.
You say you spent last
night at your girlfriend's
and you're just
now coming home?
Yeah, that's right.
How did you know someone
broke into your house?
Well, I saw the broken glass
when I was comin' around
the side of the house.
- Look at me.
- What?
You're lying.
You know you're lying.
I know you're lying.
They know you're lying.
I haven't seen Raymond
since I got out of prison.
You know, I always try to give
a man a decent chance.
Usually it's three
wrong answers.
If you walk in and make
a guy tell you what you
wanna know right away,
it seems to me
it robs him of his dignity.
It makes him feel like he didn't
even try to be a stand-up guy.
I'm tellin' you, I haven't...
You're telling me
nothing, Wayne.
You're starting to irritate me.
But you will tell me what
I wanna know, believe me.
I only mention it because
everybody tells me what
I wanna know eventually.
Please sit down, Wayne.
I say again, take a seat.
Where we goin', Ray?
I'm gonna do the deal
at my brother's house.
He's away in Canada.

all teary eyed and shit.
Shit, the fool ain't
never killed nobody before.
Yeah, well, he still hasn't.
What you talkin' about?
That guy in the parking lot,
he wasn't dead.
He was just hurt real bad.
I had to finish him off.
My whole life I've been afraid.
Not tonight.
I tell myself
it was self defense.
It wasn't.
I could've walked away
before it started.
But I didn't.
I just wanted them to
know that I wasn't afraid.
I wanted to impress them.
I love you, Raymond.
Addy, if I ever thought that it
could get this bad...
I mean, I didn't mean it
to get this crazy.
I know. I know. It's okay.
It's okay. I love you.
- I love you too.
- Forever?
I love you more than forever.
Forever'll be done,
and I'll love you.
You know, we've been together
for a long time.
And us goin' to Mexico,
that's kind of like sayin'
we're gonna spend the rest
of our lives together.
And I was thinking,
once we get down to Mexico,
you know, maybe we should...
What?
I don't know.
You know, once we're there,
you know, if you want...
Raymond Lembecke, are you
askin' me to marry you?
Yes.
Really?
Well, what do you say?
I say yes.
Yes?
They're at the brother's house.
Thank you.
Yeah? Thompson.
Hey, it's Marcus.
Marcus! Where are you?
Raymond's brother's
house, outside of.
Truth or Consequences,
New Mexico.
About three miles south
on Highway Two-Five.
Are the hostages
still with you?
Yes.
It would be better
if you can get away.
No, you listen to me.
I will not abandon
these hostages.
You just make sure your
people don't kill us.
Marcus?
Yo, man, just take care of
that for me, all right?
Damn!
- What are you doing, Marcus?
- I made a phone call.
- To who?
- To my boy.
At quarter to 5:00
in the morning?
Yeah. He works graveyard.
What'd you call him for?
You askin' a lot of
questions, Raymond.
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't answering
any, Marcus.
I "calleded" him to
make sure everything
was okay with my mother.
She on welfare.
I ain't exactly been in
the position to, like, go
check up on her lately.
Why didn't you
call her yourself?
First of all, she's sleeping.
And second, even if
somethin' was wrong,
she wouldn't tell me.
Know what I'm sayin'?
She wouldn't even tell me 'cause
she-she-she's like that.
- She's proud.
- I get it.
Yeah.
Call your friend back.
Call him back!
When he answers, all you gotta
do is you just tell him,
"I wanna make sure you
understood what I said."
Okay, now call him.
Call him up.
Let me listen.
Hello?
Frankie, it's Marcus.
Yeah, man.
What, did you fuckin'
forget somethin'?
I just wanna make sure you
"understooded" what I told you.
Yeah. What do you
think I am, stupid?
I just wanna make sure!
I'm gonna go over and check on
your mom in a little while.
Mind if I put on a shirt first?
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, later.
I'm sorry, man.
It's...
Everything's fucked up.
We got 'em.
Assemble a team.
We're movin' now.
Hey, Addy.
- What?
- Wake up.
- We gotta go.
- Go where?
To Mexico like we planned,
but we gotta go now.
We gotta do the deal, right?
Fuck the deal, Addy.
I'm thinking of us.
Now, come on.
There's more to think
of than just us.
The others can do whatever
they want. Come on. Get up.
I'm pregnant, Ray.
What are you talking about?
You're gonna be a daddy.
Why didn't you tell me before?
I just didn't want you
to think you had to marry me.
Think I had to marry you?
I wanted to marry you
the first time I saw you.
Come on, baby.
We gotta go. Come on.
Okay, okay.
Hey, Ray, look at
this piece of shit!
Found him hidin'
over the ridge.
Get him in the house,
Curtis. Come on.
Addy, load the car.
Move!
Get in there.
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Shut up.
Listen to me.
Something's gonna go down
here in a few minutes,
but help is on the way.
If anything happens before
help arrives, Gordon,
grab Donna and get her out.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
- I'm a drug enforcement agent.
- What?
Gordon, you never
killed that guy.
When Curtis went over to
him, he was still alive.
Curtis killed him.
Why didn't you tell us
who you were before?
I couldn't trust you.
Just stay down.
Hurry up, Addy.
- Just do the deal, Ray.
- I'm gonna do the deal.
You Raymond Lembecke?
- That's right.
- I'm Cecil.
What you got?
Come inside.
You don't know
who you're fucking with.
Shut up.
That looks like it hurts.
This is my lucky quarter.
You better get one of these.
You don't look that lucky.
Nope.
- We're gonna have to test it.
- Come on. Take one.
You seem a little
too nervous, man.
I'm in a hurry.
It's good.
You're a rich man now, Raymond.
What are you gonna do?
None of your fuckin' business.
Jesus Christ! Look at that!
Can you see that?
Shit!
Come on! Come on!
Drop the weapon!
Oh, God!
Let's go! Stay low! Move!
Gordon, Donna, follow me!
All right, let's go.
Come on, honey!
We'll be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
Gordon!
Stay down!
Gordon! Get down!
Gordon!
No, I'm not one of them.
I'm not with them.
- I know.
- Please, don't.
Close your eyes.
Take your positions!
Okay, snipers,
verify your targets!
- Target verified.
- Verified.
Okay, go, go, go now!
Gimme the gun, Addy.
Gimme the gun.
Gimme the...
Oh, honey.
Hey. Hey.
Babe. Hey.
Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
You're okay.
Addy, come on.
Okay, hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Listen, it'll be okay.
It'll be okay, baby.
On me!
Raymond!
Raymond, stop!
Raymond, stop, goddamn it!
Drop it!
Raymond, I'm a drug
enforcement agent!
I just wanna be alone
with Addy.
It's over, man.
