Outgoing mail? Ten dollars!
Mail.
Any outgoing mail?
Ten dollars!
Any outgoing mail?
Mail!
Anyone outgoing mail?
Do you have money now?
I want your real money,
not your fake money.
Get someone over here!
Something's wrong with
the inmate in cell 309!
Thank you.
Sure thing.
I'm here until the day I die anyway.
You should have find some fun out there.
The Hong Kong police has
come to take you back.
Out!
Open the door!
What are you looking at?
Two years ago,
on February 2nd,
seven armored truck guards
from the Central Bank
were killed on a Canadian highway.
In June of the same year,
the Merlin Guerilla in
the Golden Triangle was attacked.
Eighty-two dead and 157 injured.
September 10th last year,
A murder-arson case at a
Tuen Mun printing mill.
Hours later,
Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer
Lee Wing-chit
and art dealer Lok Man were found killed
in a Tsim Sha Tsui hotel.
All these murders
are connected to
an international counterfeiting syndicate.
Its members include
Ng Yam from Macau, Lee Li Wah,
Vietnam national Shum Sei Hoi, and Wong Bo.
They're all dead
except for two members still at large.
You're one of them.
And the other is your leader,
"Painter."
He's completely off the grid.
No intelligence agency in
the world has anything on him.
This photo
was taken from a distribution tower
on the highway in Canada.
It's the only photo we have of him.
Drink up.
Tell me,
who exactly is Painter?
Do you know why he's off the grid?
Because he doesn't leave a trail.
He kills anyone
he suspects of betraying him.
If he knows you're here...
What makes you think he doesn't know?
This is Police Headquarters.
What could possibly happen?
If he knows I'm here,
then everyone in this
room is as good as dead.
Good morning, sir!
Goodbye, sir!
Mr. Lee.
Are you okay?
All of us are gonna die!
You trying to scare me?
Trust me.
Just send me back to jail, okay?
Please. We're all gonna die.
Please...
Please send me back to jail...
Get Mr. Lee out of here.
Please send me back to jail...
Mr. Lee.
Eat up.
Get changed.
The skin and hair fiber we found
at the scene of the Tsim
Sha Tsui hotel murder
have been analyzed.
They matched your DNA sample.
The saliva on
the utensil fragment belongs to you.
The oil on the bullet shells belong to you.
The Department of Justice
says they're all admissible in court.
So the police is officially charging you...
with murder.
Those evidence were faked.
Who do you think you're fooling?
The furniture is real.
The bed sheets are real.
The utensils are real.
And DNA is collected from you.
You know better than anyone
if those evidence can really be faked.
I'm a dead man either way.
You think you can scare me
into talking?
If you're dead either way,
you should make yourself useful first.
I'll tell the world
that you sold Painter out for a plea deal.
I'll ask Witness Protection
to send you to a place where
Painter can find you.
You bitch!
Sir!
YT
It's been forever since
I've seen you on the golf course.
Working on a huge case?
Deputy Commissioner,
I'm here as Yuen Man's
legal representative.
We wish to bail Lee Man out.
Is he that important?
You have multi-national
company CEOs as his guarantor.
Even the member of Executive Council.
Miss Yuen is a world-famous artist
and she considers Mr. Lee a good friend.
Mr. Lee...
is a key witness to multiple murders.
We can't just set him free.
But I hear...
He's actually the prime
suspect of those murders.
At the lab
I've looked through the evidence you have.
Their authenticity is spotty at best.
You're clearly setting him up.
My dear,
you're going a bit far, aren't you?
The courts can decide,
how far I can go.
Deputy Commissioner Ho,
do you really need to cover
for your daughter like this?
Don't get the wrong idea.
Both my daughter and I are dead set
on seeing this to the end.
I hear that he's a dead man
if he ever enters a courtroom.
I'm not here to hear you argue.
Where there's a will,
there's a way.
Miss Yuen,
do you recognize me?
We met on the day your fiancee was killed.
I took you to the hospital.
I asked you to find a way to set him free.
If you can't think of one,
then I'll do it my way.
Fine.
I have an idea.
Ask him to spill everything about Painter.
Then we'll set him loose.
Can you get him to talk?
They offered a deal.
If you spill the beans on Painter,
then they'll let you go.
You know that if I talk...
we'll both be in danger.
So you know that
if I leave right now,
then I won't be in danger.
Am I right?
If you're not going to talk,
Then I'm leaving.
Why are you doing this?
Do you have to ask?
The man I love was killed by Painter.
Don't I have a right to the truth?
You do.
Roll the camera.
In 1985,
I met Miss Yuen
in Vancouver.
We had just started out
as painters at the time.
Our dream was to find
buyers for our paintings
A decade later,
we still hadn't sold a single one.
You're home.
You didn't pay the gas bill?
You didn't pay the electricity bill?
How closely can you copy it?
How much are you willing to pay?
This piece is titled "The Four Seasons."
Well, I don't see any season,
except what looks like
somebody trying to copy
the styles of the four great masters.
Miss Yuen,
your paintings are creations.
They're fantastic. They are original.
Lee Man...
only repeats what has been done before.
The world only needs one Van Gogh.
And the second, the third...
and whoever wants to come after that,
they have no value.
I'm sorry... but
if you don't want to represent Lee Man,
then...
I don't want you to be my manager.
But your work is incomparable to his!
It doesn't even stand...
I don't care.
I can take you to the world.
I can take you to places.
I cannot take both of you.
Where have you been?
I bumped into Mr. Lok,
so we had a chat.
He hoped that I could
talk some sense into you
and not force him to buy my work.
I...
Why would I force him?
I just gave him some advice.
Stop giving him a hard time.
Today, Petroff Gallery
bought up all of my paintings.
I already received the deposit.
And I've already worked
things out with Mr. Lok.
Your first solo show is
being held next week.
You're going to do great.
Hey...
You need a new hair dryer.
The temperature's too high.
The ink will look different
when it's dried.
A pro will spot it in minutes!
Hey...
I...
I thought you'd forgotten this piece,
so I went to Petroff Gallery.
You're being unfair to yourself.
How is it unfair?
Mr. Lok was right.
There is only one Van Gogh in this world.
The rest...
is worthless.
But there's only one Lee
Man in this world, too.
You're valuable in your own way.
These few days...
I've been...
I've been working on this.
I...
It's been a real thrill.
Suddenly, I felt like
I was born to draw these.
If I say that my value lies
in faking these drawings,
can you accept that?
I love you more than anyone...
Can you accept that or not?!
Hey...
I'm not interested in that story.
I am.
So you're staying, then?
Yes, Madam.
Let's bring Painter into the picture.
This is DÃ¼rer's "Knight,
Death and the Devil",
it's authentic.
Fifty grand US dollars is a steal,
and it's only this cheap
because it was stolen.
I'd like to meet...
the man who painted this.
Sir...
You must be joking.
This painting...
was done in 1513.
I'm talking about
the man who made this copy.
This is our artist, Yuen Man.
Welcome to our show.
Miss Yuen is a post-impressionist painter.
This part is about China,
and the Canada part is over there.
On the last day...
you finally show up.
Why did you put that there?
You know what?
I've had a few interested
buyers for that one.
I hear that everything's
already been sold...
except for that painting.
Maybe they think that
you drew that one, too.
You haven't been home for days.
Can we just...
not fight?
For once?
I'm sorry.
I'm so moved.
The great four masters
of the 1950s,
all of their styles...
encapsulated
on a single canvas.
It's an amazing imitation.
Even better than a copier.
Is the painter named Xerox, by any chance?
Great art should be
offering us a bit of beauty
in our dire lives.
But...
what I see here,
is that the world
is a table of...
leftovers.
Life is already crap,
and you expect me
to look at something this rancid?
This makes me sick...
Get out!
Yuen Man.
Mr. Lok,
please.
Sir,
I apologize to you on Miss Yuen's behalf.
I'm not here for your girlfriend.
I'm here...
about your painting.
Look at the print on the copper plate
of the original.
You can estimate the depth of
the engravement from that.
Drawing paper is more complicated.
400 years ago,
the patterns were made using
metal wire mesh on airlaid paper.
Move the light,
then you can see the lines,
like watermarks on bills.
Putting the paper
in calcium carbonate
and lignin will control the acidity.
Most use vegetable oil
to make printing ink.
It dries fast
and is stable.
But I use...
a mixture of walnut oil,
coal ash and turpentine.
Do I look more like a
chemist than an artist?
We shouldn't have come here.
We should've found a nicer place
and opened a nice bottle of red.
That's more fitting...
for an artist like you.
I think a beer is more fitting
for an artist like me.
You underestimate yourself.
The pursuit of perfection in any field...
is an art.
If you have the drive...
even a counterfeit can be better than
the real thing.
You're into counterfeit paintings, too?
I'm into replicas.
Replicas so real that even top experts
can't tell the difference.
I'm telling you...
in this world,
there can only be one
leading man out of a hundred people.
The leading man
pursues perfection at all times.
But he must first have
a stage to perform on.
If you want a stage,
call me.
If you want to struggle,
go ahead and struggle.
I gave you your first showing.
Top ten percent art
buyers in the world came,
and you are looking at this?
Did you hear what he said?
Of course I heard what he was saying,
but he was talking the truth!
God.
Real or not,
the fact that it didn't sell
already says plenty.
I'm done with this.
Then what will you do?
Keep making counterfeits?
I'm sorry. I...
Get away,
you'll get burned!
Where's the extinguisher?
Pop the safety lock...
Look at this! Who burns their own painting?
How can you ask me to represent him?
Welcome to the team.
Alright, tell me.
Whose painting to you want me to replicate?
That's all you're offering?
I want you to replicate this bill.
No way.
No way...
No way... are you nuts?
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not some amateur with a hobby.
I'm an artist, like yourself.
My art happens to be...
counterfeit money.
Just help me with production.
Everything else
is out of your hands. I promise.
I don't even know your name
or who you are.
How can I count on your promise?
My name is Ng Fuk Seng.
I'm from Hong Kong.
I come from three generations
of counterfeiters.
No one in my family has ever gone to jail
because we've always played by the rules.
All we do is distribution.
My buyers are powerful people
and...
they've always protected my family.
I can't make a lot of guarantees,
but one thing that I can promise is that
the "Superdollar" I produce
will be the world's favorite
replica painting.
No matter what you say,
black...
won't magically become white.
Those who only see the
world in black and white
are doomed to be failures.
If you don't want to join us,
then pretend that you've never met me.
Here's your seat.
May I have your jacket?
Sure.
Thanks.
Thank you. Enjoy your flight.
I was sure that I'd lost you.
Sorry...
I went to see her off.
Yuen Man is going to the US today.
When we're done,
I'll help you get her back.
I'm here to work for you.
You don't need to worry
about anything else.
I worry because you work for me.
You know, most accomplished men
do what they do for women.
My father once said,
a man who can give up love
will fail at everything he does.
Here's your champagne.
Thanks.
Then who do you do it for?
I'm a rare exception...
I don't need a woman to
accomplish anything.
In March of this year,
the US government released
a new design for the $100 bill.
They decided to use the Duplessis
version of the Franklin portrait.
They even enlarged it by 50%0.
The result is more lines and more details.
Even the commercial printer with
the highest resolution
will result in the moirÃ© effect.
What's even worse is that,
there's a microprint.
On Franklin's collar
that says "The United States of America."
You'll need a more
meticulous printing plate.
Do you have a good plate maker?
Meet Uncle Yam,
our plate maker.
After finishing the plate,
then we need to get color-shifting ink.
Miss Wah,
our administrator.
Brother Four.
Bobby
Logistics
Logistics and Security.
Once we get the ink,
then we need starch-free paper.
The ink on the counterfeit
banknote detector pen
turns purple from chemical reaction
on normal paper.
It turns yellow on starch-free paper
for banknotes.
That's why starch-free paper
is regulated around the world.
So we'll have to make our own paper?
Impossible.
The cost is too high.
I'll figure something out.
You take care of the watermark first.
The watermark is made
with fibers on the bill.
If we don't produce our own paper...
it'll be virtually impossible to reproduce.
Why do you think we hired you,
man?
Boss.
Hey...
Let's eat.
Boss.
Boss.
Let me finish this round first.
You guys are still betting?
A thousand.
I say it's real.
He calls himself a pro?
A thousand...
on fake.
I know this "Su Shi painting."
I saw the real thing last year
at a factory owner's office.
Five grand,
it's fake.
It was auctioned off three
months ago in Taiwan
for $800,000.
Do you think that was a real
one or a counterfeit?
Hey...
This is our hobby,
solving unresolved art problems.
Would you like to play along?
Twenty bucks.
Those two paintings are real.
So is this.
Butt out
if you don't know anything.
Chinese painters have a unique talent.
An ink wash painting
can be cut up into layers
depending on the thickness of the paper.
It's usually three layers.
The stroke of a master painter
can reach multiple layers.
Even if the painting is
cut up into three layers,
each layer will look identical.
The ink is a bit light on this one,
so it must be the bottom layer.
You know your stuff.
I'm in!
Hey...
I got it!
The solution is...
When we make paper,
we use the pattern made with the iron drum
before the pulp hardens.
When the paper hardens,
It'll stay in the middle of the paper.
We put the watermark on one layer
and sandwich it between
two layers of paper.
Three layers become one layer.
That's how we'll
create the watermark effect on the bill!
That's genius.
That's how we'll get
the security thread in there, too.
Miss Wah.
Open up the champagne!
Forget about that,
Let's splurge
and get some abalone!
You ain't eating a thing
until that printing plate is done!
Kid,
Do you know... what's the most important
thing about making a printing plate?
Precision.
And how precise do we need to be?
Down to a 1,000th of a millimeter.
Is that enough?
10,000th of a millimeter.
Still not enough.
We have to make...
a perfect replica of the original.
Chemistry...
Optics...
These can all be measured.
But making a plate is all about instincts.
The flow of the water
and the heat of the fire
must be adjusted constantly
according to the change in materials.
They all serve to create...
a perfect replica of the original.
In two months,
we made 17 prototypes of the plate.
How is it?
This one taste good to you?
I think,
we can start electroplating.
No moirÃ© effect.
The microprint looks sharp.
Let's print a few more
and see if it'll leave
scratches on the plate.
Uncle Yam.
You and Painter both have the surname Ng.
Are you two related?
No.
I used to work for his father.
When his old man died,
the business was passed to him,
so I just naturally
started working for him.
He told me that
no one in three generations of his family
has been arrested.
Is that true?
It's true.
They play by the rules of the game.
They never spend the money they print,
and our clients stay quiet about us.
Like we don't exist.
Your family's never asked
you about your work?
How did you know that I have a family?
You were talking on the
phone a few days ago.
Hey.
The rules say that
we're not supposed to know
about each other's lives.
I can chop off your hand
for being so nosy!
The Five Flowers of the Ng Family.
Nice, right?
They're in Macau.
All they know is that I'm in antiques.
The rules say,
the fewer number of people know...
...the longer we'll live.
Did Painter teach you that?
In this line of work,
following the rules
doesn't guarantee a thing.
Look at Painter's old man.
He got in a dispute
with some Russians over
price in the Netherlands.
He got beaten to death by a dozen guys.
His factory was torched, too.
For people like us...
our handicraft is everything.
Be cool, and you'll stay out of trouble.
Hey... Kid,
I can't believe we achieved
this even on normal paper.
You really do have talent.
Painter will spoil you like crazy,
don't worry.
It doesn't matter.
This is done through letterpress.
Any pro...
can tell it's a fake.
Hey...
Painter says
he's already found a machine
for intaglio printing.
I thought only governments
can get their hands on those.
How did he...
Hey...
Pack up.
We're heading to Eastern Europe tomorrow.
See?
What are we packing?
A 300-ton industrial paper printing machine
from a state-owned firm.
Bidding starts at 1,000 US dollars.
$1, 100!
$1,200!
$2,400!
$3,000!
$3,000 going once!
$5,000!
$5,000 going once!
$5,000 going twice!
$5,000 going for the last time!
Sold!
This intaglio-style machine
used to print foreign exchange certificates
for the Central Bank.
Now it's being sold as scrap metal.
It'll work with some elbow grease.
We still need starch-free paper.
Check here.
Are you kidding me?
Hey... It really exists!
In the US,
starch-free paper is
regulated by the government.
Can you believe that
the FCC used up the remaining paper
from money making...
and used them to print the phone book?
The thickness is...
exactly one-third of an American bill.
We sandwich two layers between
the layer with the watermark.
Just right.
It's practically fate!
Aren't we just buying paper?
Why do we have to get dressed up?
When you become the leading man,
you can do whatever you want.
Let's cut to the chase.
I don't have a lot of time!
I believe that you
have received my order,
Mr. Baine
What are you trying to do with my paper?
We're one of the biggest charity
organizations in Hong Kong.
It's for printing educational comic books.
Forget about it.
Forget this meeting ever took place.
We are running a
multi-billion dollar business here.
We sell paper by the ton.
How many tons of comic books
can you possibly print?
Wait, wait, wait...
We print them for schoolkids in Africa.
Do you have any idea how many kids
we're talking about?
Boss,
we got it!
We've done well, boss,
so why the long face?
Why the long freaking face?
We just bought 500 tons of paper!
500 tons!
I'm telling ya,
you better keep your ass alive!
Don't you die until
you've used up all this paper!
Where the hell are you going?
I'm talking to you...
Where are you going?
We just need the color-shifting ink now.
That letter isn't belonged to you!
You're not opening it anyway.
Why are you so nervous?
Wanna look?
I just came to drop off my key.
I'll never see her again.
Never ever?
I decided that when I
followed you back to Hong Kong.
Hey...
Do you know what Yuen Man's
exhibition is called?
Au Revoir Seasons.
As in "Four Seasons!"
The painting that you burned.
You're so petty for a man.
Where are we going anyway?
When you came back to Hong Kong with me,
I told you that
I'll help you get her back.
Why did you suddenly decide
to shut her out for good?
What would I say to her then?
Tell her that I've spent the last six
months making counterfeit money?
I've already figured out an alibi for you.
So I'll just keep lying?
How can an ordinary man spend
his life with the woman he loves
without a little white lie or two?
I'm not ordinary, then, alright?
Not alright!
Listen to me,
I brought you to this stage.
You're not just going to be a leading man,
you're going to be Yuen Man's leading man.
Did you just come up with that?
Listen!
If you give up on her,
then you're giving up on yourself.
And I won't let that happen!
Put this on!
What's this?
Hey...
What the hell are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm committing a robbery!
You wanna die?
Put that on.
Bobby...
Shut up.
Quick, get back into the van...
Easy, man.
We don't want to hurt anyone.
Catch.
Pick it up!
Open the door.
Go!
Such a stupid.
Go away.
Are you alright?
You freaking shot me?!
It's blocked.
Let it go, you're fine.
I'm fine,
but he's screwed!
Such trigger-happy fingers.
What the hell?
All that for two buckets.
It's the same every time.
How can you succeed with that temper?
Stop!
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?
Sit down...
and don't ask questions.
We have six Ng Fuk Sengs in the database.
One is 87 years old.
Two 16-year-olds: One male, one female.
The rest are between ages 35 and 57.
We've sent people to bring them here.
I want background checks on all of them,
including known associates.
Painter may just be borrowing the name.
Got it.
Can you check the camera over there?
Sir.
The suspected robbers took the
color-shifting inks for printing debentures.
Only counterfeit syndicates will
go to such lengths to get them.
Well, this falls under
the jurisdiction of the Federal Police.
You're just a provincial police officer.
Why don't you just...
I'm having my Federal Police
promotion interview next week!
Why don't you call me after you pass that?
Hey, man,
let me get a light.
Thank you.
Hello?
I can't hear you.
Lee Wing Chit
is a counterfeit expert with
the Canadian Federal Police.
Hi,
I'm Inspector Ho Wai Lam.
Contact me if you need anything.
Inspector,
do you...
have my lighter?
Yes...
Sorry.
Thanks.
Sorry.
That's my daughter.
I don't understand how they managed
to avoid the moirÃ© effect on their bills.
Hey...
What effect?
MoirÃ© effect.
That's on page 69.
I'm off.
Bishop Ma.
Painter loves the company of women.
We're in business
once we get them in place.
From what I hear...
Painter is a cautious man.
He doesn't like dealing with strangers.
If you lie to me,
my people are going to
have a few words with you.
Of course I won't!
I'll go get them now.
What are you doing here?
I put a tracker
in your lighter.
Who has Law Sam
set you up with?
I'm dealing with very
dangerous felons here.
This isn't kids' play.
This is Hong Kong.
It's out of your jurisdiction.
It's taken me a year.
Now I finally get a chance
to sit down with Painter.
Painter? Who's that?
Bishop Ma.
Come on,
they're here.
This is Bobby.
That's Brother Four.
I guess Mr. Painter isn't a religious man.
Men of faith like myself...
We know that confidence
is the most important thing in business.
If he doesn't have confidence in me,
then let's not waste each other's time.
I'm here to buy counterfeit money,
not guns!
Painter told us to have some fun.
You have something against fun?
No...
Not at all.
Let's drink.
Let's party!
Your girl?
You mind?
Go ahead.
He's a trustworthy guy.
Wait for the call!
Are you okay?
It looks like...
this Painter
had quite the effect on you.
If it wasn't for him...
we wouldn't have ended up here.
Looks to me...
you'll never be free of him.
In other words,
we're headed for a tragedy.
We're not.
I promise.
Why are you promising me?
I'm just a supporting character
in your story.
You're the love of my life.
I said so in the letter.
Madam.
We're running out of time.
Let's keep going.
Let's continue.
Look,
it's better than the real thing!
Cheers!
I've got my eyes on a Ferrari.
Cheers!
It only costs five mil.
You'll crash the damn thing.
It'll crash on you first. Bottom up.
What will we do when we run out of ink?
Go on another killing spree?
You think that I wanted to kill those guys?
I was saving your ass!
Is that still true?
You said that I can leave at any time.
I'll figure out a new way to get ink,
then I'm out.
You've got two legs.
You can leave whenever you like.
I don't want anyone else to die.
That's enough!
Get to work.
We're shipping out next week!
Let's get to work.
Turn heading 270,
Charlie Charlie 005
Good work,
everyone!
Cheers!
You're amazing, boss!
What the hell are you doing?
Let's get outta here.
Uncle Yam.
Mr. Painter,
Ms. Ng Sau-ching
is our counterfeit expert.
She says she admires your work.
Thank you.
How is the General doing?
He's doing well.
We just have to keep him away from this.
Then we should drink all of it
and keep it out of his sight.
Cheers!
Can't you see that I'm with guests?
It's getting late.
We should head back.
Sure. I'll see you out.
We'll send a car to pick you up tomorrow.
Please send my regards to the General.
Tell him...
to get some rest tonight.
Sure.
Good night.
See you tomorrow.
What the hell was that?
Do you know who that was?
I noticed the color-shifting paint
on that car a few days ago.
Turns out that the paint has the
same formula as the ink
used on the US dollar.
NASA used this paint for smart glass
on their space shuttles a decade ago,
then they sold
the formula to a car paint factory.
I've already bought several buckets.
I'll adjust the color
when we go back to Hong Kong.
You'll never have to steal it again.
Thanks.
I've bought a resort
under your name.
Once we finish this deal,
you'll have enough money
to paint with Yuen Man for
the rest of your days.
It's time to win her back.
Hello, General.
Hi.
Come,
I've made some nice tea.
Sure.
Hold it.
Let go when I tell you to.
It's been tough for you these few years.
If your father can see you
come back like this...
I'm sure he'd be smiling
from the great beyond.
In these years,
if it wasn't for your friends' help,
I'd be nothing.
I hear from my secretary
that you've made a new
version of the US dollar,
a "Superdollar"
that's a perfect replica.
We usually...
go one for twenty,
but
I'll give you one for ten.
A 100% increase?
How can I accept
such generosity?
For the next six months,
your team will stay here
and teach my people
counterfeiting techniques.
How does that sound?
Teach them?
You're different from them.
Your father and I were best friends.
Stay here.
My home is your home.
Half a year here
will earn you enough...
to be set for life.
If your father is still here,
he would say that this is a good deal.
I doubt that.
Seven years ago
that you hired the Russians
to kill my father.
If he was here,
I don't think he'll like your deal.
Are you here to settle old debts?
What do you think?
What do you have to settle it with?
You make counterfeits.
I don't buy this for a second.
Man.
Let go.
Let go!
No...
General,
Lee Man is the one who
knows the techniques.
Painter...
is expendable.
Let go!
Kill him!
Open up...
Fucking open up!
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
But he's screwed.
For a year after that,
we stopped working.
We stayed in the Golden Triangle
and took a long break.
Your face was badly injured.
I didn't want you to see it.
Thank you.
I got her a passport.
Her name is now Yuen Man.
Pack up. Let's go.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?!
I finally understand.
Understand what?
I finally understand why...
you won't look at me.
Hey...
I've bought up all the paintings.
When the show ends,
they'll all be sent to the resort.
Yuen Man will be so touched
when she sees it.
It was bought by a criminal.
How will that make her happy?
Is there a misunderstanding between us?
Maybe we should talk it out.
Have you decided on a date for the wedding?
Marriage?
Sau Ching, let's go.
Marry with this guy?
Hey.
They're getting married!
Well?
When's your flight?
You probably know already.
Of course I do.
I even know that you've bought two tickets.
Sau Ching wants to leave with me.
She's leaving with you?
When did I say that she can go?
What is she to you?
A substitute?
He saved my life.
He can do whatever he pleases.
It's none of your business.
But I saved his life.
So how is this not my business?
It's not!
Now you want to be
the leading man and call the shots?
Think you've got the clout?
I haven't finished
making your color-shifting ink.
Is this a mutiny?
Do you think that I need you that much?
It's not an opinion.
It's a fact.
Get your ass outta here once
you're done with the ink.
Thank you.
We've arrived, boss.
I wish you two...
happily ever after.
Wait for the call!
This Bishop Ma...
Is he trustworthy?
They've made a reasonable offer.
They want to distribute in the Middle East.
I've asked a few people
who's dealt with him.
Bishop Ma never shows his face.
He's safe.
That means no one can identify him.
Who's vouching for him?
Law Sam from the Taiwan gang.
Uncle Yam's old client.
Uncle Yam's antique clock...
did he buy that in Canada?
What are you doing?
Why are you packing up?
What's the rush?
Uncle Yam, that clock...
Uncle Yam,
that antique clock you bought in Canada.
Was it bought with counterfeits?
No way...
Does Painter know?
You have to go!
It's my fault.
I broke the rules.
Punish me. Take my hands...
Please,
you can chop my hands off.
Chop your hands?
What do the rules say?
Please don't touch my wife and kids.
Don't kill them!
They didn't do anything!
They didn't do anything!
What kind of rules are these?!
You have to take his family's life?
When he used those bills...
did he consider what would
happen to our lives?
I broke the rules and didn't hold back.
I beg you...
My daughters are still small.
Please...
For your dad's sake...
The rules are the rules!
Screw your rules!
I've planted a tracker...
in the watch.
In the mobile phone,
too.
I don't need this anymore?
Nope.
Take it out for me, then.
Sure.
Watch your back.
"I'd like a date with you.
I'll wait for you after work."
You up?
Here.
Ice that.
After today,
we're even.
When we're done here,
you can walk away.
Bishop Ma,
finally we meet.
So you're the famous Painter.
Skip the formalities.
Take a seat.
Let's cut to the chase, then.
Show me the stuff.
For this transaction...
I've brought three million US dollars.
I'd like to
have our next transaction in Canada.
For that deal,
I want 30 million.
What if we change the deal
and I sell you the master plate instead?
Is this a joke?
I don't know a thing about printing.
What the hell should I do with your plate?
I have some bad memories in Canada.
I don't want to go back there.
Once I sell you the plate,
I'm out of this business for good.
This is a good deal for you.
Man.
Open it up.
Take the plate out.
Take the plate out!
I just saved your ass again.
You were a nobody when I found you,
trapped in Chinatown
making counterfeit paintings.
I made you a leading man.
I've opened so many paths for you.
But wherever you get to make a choice,
you choose to run away!
You're such a disappointment!
This is your last chance.
Come here.
To gain something,
you have to pay the price.
Even if you don't want it now,
you still have to pay the piper.
Go ahead.
Kill him.
Once he's dead...
Yuen Man is yours.
Stop trembling.
Here,
I'll help you.
Put it down!
Looks like Mr. Lee here
is gonna be the leading man.
We're partners.
How dare you point a gun at me?
Do you have the balls to fire?
I'll bet a million dollars that you don't!
A million dollars...
I'll bet...
Let go of me.
Please.
Let me go!
Let's go.
We have to go.
If you don't move, I'll kill her.
Let's go!
Come on!
Go...
After that...
Sau Ching and I...
We hid out in the resort
that Painter bought for me.
Uncle Yam's entire family was killed.
Painter is still alive.
The police never recovered his body.
Why have you been hiding
the newspapers from me?
I bought your favourite wine.
Hotpot for dinner tonight.
I can't stay here anymore.
Yuen Man
is holding a memorial
for Lok Man next week.
Painter will get to her there.
If you stay here,
Painter won't get to her.
The ticket is almost ready.
Thank you for your patience.
Is this yours?
Let me see that.
The money looks real to me.
Did we get the wrong guy?
We're being paid to get
him, so shut your trap!
Don't you touch her!
What the hell do you want?!
Let her go!
Sign here.
Have you met him before?
How about him?
No.
The police will grant bail to Mr. Lee.
He must stay in the city
and report to us every 24 hours.
I understand.
There's something I don't get.
If it wasn't for Lee Man,
your fiancee would still be alive.
Did you come to save him
because...
you used to be together?
Or is it because you
never forgot about him?
So...
what was Lok Man to you,
then?
A substitute?
What the hell are you saying?
Since that Canadian cop of yours is dead,
will the next man you
find be his substitute?
He's irreplaceable.
There will never be another him.
Don't be so sure.
We can go.
See you tomorrow.
Lam,
send someone to look after him.
Roger.
Here you go.
Later,
if the cops show up,
give me a call.
Don't open the door under any circumstance.
I didn't think you'd come.
You think I can refuse you?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I've done you wrong. I...
I'm sorry.
Can you forgive me?
Thank you...
Get out of the way.
Out of the way!
This is Inspector Ho Wai Lam.
I've spotted a wanted
man in police uniform.
Lock down 4th floor in block B right now!
Alpha's at the lobby,
heading to the 4th floor.
What's your status, Bravo? Over.
Bravo copy.
Heading down from 6th floor, over.
Alpha copy.
We've joined Inspector Ho in the hallway.
We're closing in. Stand by.
Copy
What the hell is going on?!
Sir
this is Painter,
the wanted man from the counterfeit case.
A wanted man?
How can I be a wanted man?
Where do you make this stuff up?!
What's wrong with you,
man?!
My badge number is 28818.
I'm a driver for the New
Territories division,
Ng Chi Fai.
My son is Chung, your old colleague!
What's wrong with you?!
I drove your perp from
the airport three days ago!
How can you have forgotten me already?
What are you looking at?
The first time I met Painter...
on 15th August 1995.
That day...
was the last day of Yuen Man's show.
When we make paper,
we use the pattern made with the iron drum
before the pulp hardens.
It'll stay in the middle of the paper
when the paper hardens.
We put the watermark on one layer
and sandwich it between
two layers of paper.
Three layers become one layer.
That's how we'll
create the watermark effect on the bill!
I didn't think that
he'd kill everyone in the village.
That time in Canada
was the first time I saw him commit murder.
The rules are the rules!
The last time I saw Painter...
was when I got arrested by the police.
Get to the hotel!
Sir, what's the situation?
Team B was here yesterday, now two
got killed, two are severely injured.
What a terrible thing.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir!
We just found out that
the real Yuen Man has been painting
in northwestern China all this time.
She hasn't set foot away from there
since Lok Man was murdered.
The Yuen Man we met yesterday was a fake.
Get Inspector Ho on the phone.
She's with the Marine Police!
Your face was badly injured.
I asked the doctor to give a new one.
Do you like it?
I do.
I got you a passport.
From now on your name is Yuen Man.
Why are you here?
I finally get it.
Get what?
I finally get it.
What are you doing?
I finally get it.
How dare you hit me?
You wanna die?
Get out of here!
That's what you get!
Go!
What are you doing?
If you want me to become her...
Get rid of her.
Or get rid of me.
You're pointing a gun at your partner?!
You witch!
I didn't think you'd come.
You think I can refuse you?
Say,
you've only seen my real face twice.
How did you remember it so vividly?
Talent, I suppose.
How else can I survive in this business?
Is it really just talent?
What else could it be?
When we were making love...
you were looking at her face.
Were you thinking...
about me or her?
I was making love to you.
How can people like us
truly find real love?
We're lucky enough
to end up with the next best thing.
At least...
we can provide each other
with some comfort.
You know...
the fake can sometimes
be better than the real thing.
As long as we do our best
to make our love real,
isn't that enough?
Do your best?
How does that work?
Our faces are exposed now.
It's time to get new ones.
By then,
I'll put on...
any face you like.
How's that?
Sure.
That sounds good.
We'll get to the Philippines in four hours.
You should eat something.
I'm not hungry.
Why did you stop?
I'm tired.
Let me take the wheel.
I've really had enough.
I finally get it.
We're like this boat.
We're just going in circles.
We'll never move forward.
What are you talking about?
You were right last night.
Does it really matter
who's real or fake?
The most important thing
is to be together.
That's enough.
Lee Man, you've been surrounded!
The police is boarding your boat.
139379
The boat's been going in circles...
you've been surrounded!
We're still in Hong Kong waters.
The police is boarding your boat.
Maybe this is the best outcome for us.
Sau Ching...
Don't do this.
I thought I'm Yuen Man.
Inspector Ho.
What brings you here?
I came to tell you
that we've got Painter.
Lok Man's already dead.
It doesn't matter who you've got.
Do you recognize him?
Sure.
He used to be my neighbor.
Get your butt to work.
Think you'll have trouble
with women once you're rich?
Remember,
you're just like everyone else.
You're a spectator.
You will never be a leading man.
