Quiet please,
gentlemen.
After the extraordinary duel
of a theological nature,
produced by Father Oretti's words,
I give the floor
to Mr. Benito Mussolini,
a union representative
and Socialist Party member.
Although of differing opinion,
it is correct to hear his opinion
and let him express himself freely.
I'll be brief.
Does anyone
have a watch?
Don't worry, I'm not a thief.
It is ten past five.
I challenge God!
I'll give Him five minutes
to strike me dead.
If He does not, it will be
the proof He doesn't exist.
I'm ready.
Time's up, God doesn't exist.

MILAN 1914
Long live the Republic!
A world of brothers,
in peace and freedom!
Long live Socialism!
Don't believe the Vatican nonsense.
TRENT 1907
We want justice on earth, here, now!
There can be no victory
without action, rebellion, violence.
Help me!
No warring between peoples!
Long live the Republic,
long live Socialism!
Government rulers are arming for war.
We want peace and justice.
Long live Socialism!
Victor Emanuel, son of a murderer!
Down with the King!
The son of parasites!
With the guts of the last Pope
we'll strangle the last King.
Long live the Republic!
MILAN 1914
Remember?
My love!
I love you!
SARAJEVO
WAR!
WAR!
War!
War!
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave.
I'll come too!
I have to see you again!
Sure...
Your laces are untied.
...it'll start a national revolution,
the bloody crown of Victor Emanuel,
the dwarf, will roll!
I'm sorry, you can't go in.
- You've sold out to the French!
- How much?
History will prove I'm right.
I'll be at your side
despite your insults,
a revolutionary aims straight
to the goal, at all costs.
Turn in your Party card, you're
a disgrace to the Workers' Party.
This isn't an assembly,
it's an execution.
The Party has opted
for absolute neutrality.
The Party is the people
and you've betrayed them.
- Neutrality is for the castrated.
- What?
Listen to me!
You listen too, Benito.
Proletarians don't want this war,
they don't want to get killed
for the middle-class.
They think war is suicide.
It's peace that gives bread.
This war will kill all wars.
Middle-class slave!
In July you said "down with war".
I've changed my mind!
Only mules never change paths.
Besides, the middle-class
doesn't like my interventionism,
they growl, accusing me
of recklessness,
they're scared the armed proletarians
will turn against them.
This war, in which Italy must
absolutely not remain neutral,
will turn the wheel of history
with its blood.
It will be a revolutionary war.
Peace is revolutionary.
Don't forget Blanqui:
"Who has iron, has bread".
And there's Napoleon.
Don't be appalled if I say his name.
Revolution is an idea
which has discovered bayonets.
You hate me,
because you still love me.
Take my arm.
War!
WAR
THE WORLD'S ONLY HYGIENE
RALLY DON'T ROT
In my youth I wanted
to be a musician or an author.
But I knew I'd be mediocre
and I'm terrified of time passing.
You're the editor of Avanti,
you should be satisfied.
I'll never be satisfied, never!
I have to climb higher.
I feel it my duty to be different
from all who accept their mediocrity.
The army of the virtuous
can't even imagine
how this society
can be changed, revolutionized,
moving beyond morality.
That morality is my destiny.
- Like Napoleon.
- Much more than Napoleon!
He was a mere general! Napoleon...
I've resigned from Avanti,
they wanted me
to take a leave of absence.
I'd tripled circulation,
that's why they wanted me to stay.
I'll found a newspaper.
I already have the title:
II Popolo d'Italia.
How?
Luck goes past each man's door
at least once.
You must open the door
to welcome it, at that very moment.
When I see a priest,
I feel the need to wash my hands.
Long live Italy! Down with Germany!
War! Down with tyranny!
Long live the national revolution!
Depart Italian soil,
depart, the time has come...
depart, all foreigners.
Ida?
What happened?
I sold everything.
What do you mean?
I sold everything.
The apartment, the shop,
the furniture, the jewelry.
For your newspaper.
Take it.
No.
It's done, you have to take it.
No.
It's no sacrifice,
it's a joy, I love you.
- It's a loan.
- Alright... a loan.
I'll sign a receipt.
- Later.
- Now.
"I,
Benito Mussolini,
receive
from Lady
Ida Dalser
the sum of..."
I'll leave it blank.
I'd say I have to marry you.
Say "I love you" just once.
AUDACITY!
AUDACITY!
Long live the War!
Down with neutrality!
En garde.
Doctor!
The duel ends here.
- Have you had satisfaction?
- No.
Let them treat you.
First I want to read the record.
What happened?
A duel.
I have to talk to you, it's urgent.
- Can't you wait?
- No, it's urgent.
I have to talk to you right away.
I'm pregnant.
Better a baptism than a funeral.
Wait.
A duel to the death,
to kill each other.
They began before
the judge opened procedures.
A blow to the ear, one to the arm...
Mussolini wanted to kill him.
It was brutal!
Here's the text:
"Mussolini-Treves Duel".
Mussolini's name must come first.
Hurry, Rachele's here.
- Who's she?
- Let's go!
Go to Daddy.
Edda!
So much blood!
A clean shirt.
What did you do?
You wanted to play hero.
Give me a kiss.
Another...
ITALY DECLARES WAR
ON AUSTRIA-HUNGRY
WE MUST WIN!
Long live Italy!
Long live war!
War!
Peace!
War is the world's only hygiene.
- Peace is the only solution.
- Shut up, draft-dodger!
Depart Italian soil...
Long live neutrality,
long live Socialism!
Long live the poor!
You cowards, we're far more
Socialist than you.
We're ready to die for Italy.
Italy wants to go to war.
Italy wants peace.
You sold out to Germany and Austria.
You sold out to France.
- Italy's starving!
- You Judas!
- Long live the working class!
- You're all clowns!
You're corrupt!
Latest news!
Mussolini wounded
on the Carso Plateau.
Mussolini wounded on the Carso.
Turn the lights on!
Right here, Your Majesty.
How are you, Mussolini?
You must be suffering.
It's agony.
But we have to hold out.
General Olmi speaks highly of you.
Thank you, Your Majesty...
I just did my duty.
Italy and the House of Savoia
are very appreciative.
Why are you here? Go home, you spy!
- I'm his wife.
- What? You brazen hussy!
I'm his wife. Nothing to say?
- Be quiet.
- Tell her I'm your wife.
Don't forget your son,
don't abandon us.
- Get out!
- Don't abandon us.
Mad woman!
I'm fine.
I'll kill her, rip her ears off!
You're my woman.
You're my woman.
So, be quiet.
You're my little mouse.
Kids, stop it
or we won't bring you anymore.
Sit down!
Sit in your seats.
FUTURISTIC EXPO 1917
Welcome, Mr. Editor.
I'm honored and warfully happy
that you are here.
Long live the Hero of Doberd√≤!
The "rat-a-tat-tat"
of machine guns is a joy.
Italy needs people
willing to risk their lives,
to give blood for victory.
It's the only direction for change.
Futurism will explode
the depravity of our times.
- Hurray for the war!
- Long live Futurism!
You've realized the only
redemption is to win or die.
- What's happening?
- A good deed.
Benito, look at me.
I'm ready to forgive you.
Do what you like
but keep me with you.
Get your hands off me!
REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA
POWER TO THE SOVIETS
LENIN DICTATOR
"Chaos in Russia"...
or "Lenin dictator"?
Come outside, you thief!
You've abandoned your wife and son
to the deepest poverty!
I've written to the Pope,
the Prime Minister,
the Court of Milan,
to the editor of
II Corriere della Sera!
So they'll send you to prison.
You thief!
WAR IS OVER!
OUR MARTYRS HAVE ALL ARISEN!

Ministry of Internal Affairs
February 13, 1920, Ida Dalser
and her son Benito Albino Mussolini
have been taken to the home
of her sister Adele,
who is married to Mr. Palcher,
an accountant in Trent.
Temporarily peaceful
but with her propensity to flight,
Ida Dalser is under
strict surveillance night and day.
SOCIALIST FESTIVAL
SOPRAMONTE, THREE YEARS LATER
Ida, I'll put him to bed.
Goodnight.
"My little Ida,
I've just arrived after
an endless 12-hour train ride.
My first thought,
even before dining, Is for you.
Happy?
You say you love me
but I don't love you?
I do love you, during the journey
I thought of you often.
Every time a young married couple
or young lovers got on,
I'd think about
the journey we'd planned.
I'm your savage friend and lover."
- Adele, turn the lights off.
- What's wrong?
To arms, we're Fascists.
We're the components of Fascism,
and will support
the Cause to our death...
... Its adversaries and traitors
will be exterminated without mercy.
To arms, to arms, we're Fascists.
Thank you, Ma'am.
Madame President, good morning!
Good morning, Madame President...
That's enough!
- Can you make the Fascist Salute?
- Yes.
- Which hand is used?
- The left.
The right! That's very important!
THE GOVERNMENT PRESIDED BY MUSSOLINI
TOOK OFFICE YESTERDAY
You went the wrong way, it's here.
Are you cold?
I saw Mussolini.
On the movie screen.
He's changed, he looks like a giant.
He's lost lots of hair,
but his eyes are the same.
I wrote him today too,
he'll answer sooner or later.
You write to Mussolini...
to the Pope, the King,
the Bishop, the Police.
Have you ever had a single reply?
He wants to punish me, but for what?
Not even his lowest secretary
has replied.
I've never betrayed him,
not even in thought.
- That's bad, find another man.
- Either him or no one.
I'm going to bed.
Will he get my letters?
Will he know I'm alive?
That his son attends a country school
and not the Royal College?
Your son needs normality,
put your heart at rest.
They call him a bastard.
He's distracted, his grades are poor
but not due to a country school.
His teacher hates him.
She has nothing to do with it.
We're watched day and night
like criminals.
You think we are guarded
because you're Mussolini's wife?
If the Carabinieri got the letters,
it might be different.
The Carabinieri
swear loyalty to the King.
Keep this up and
you'll lose your son.
Today I barely managed
to keep custody.
The judge knows me, but tomorrow?
- They want him in another's care.
- Whose?
- A Fascist, one of them.
- Who?
- Magistrate Giulio Bernardi.
- That snake!
Calm down,
they're all turning Fascist.
I've been threatened
to be fired from the bank.
Do we beg for alms?
It's a lost battle,
they're stronger, resign yourself!
I can't.
I'm his wife.
How can you think
I could adapt to a normal life?
Only I understand him deeply,
because I love him.
I'm convinced
he still loves me too,
we have the same ideas,
the same principles.
I was the first to believe in him.
If he is what he is,
he owes some thanks to me.
I'm the mother of his first-born son,
his natural heir
who mustn't end up like the Aiglon,
the King of Rome.
You don't even know French.
Riccardo help me.
Benito, there's just one shot here,
it's for your father's heart.
Ida, it's time.
Benito Mussolini,
do you take Ida Dalser
as your lawfully-wedded wife...
Yes, I do.
Let me go, I have to play!
Wait for me!
Good morning, Ma'am.
TODAY TRUSTED MINISTER IN TRENT
Where are you going?
...in the center
there's the altar of porphyry
with the tomb of the hero,
created by the sculptor Fozzer...
She's crazy.
We could write "paranoia syndrome".
- She has a son.
- Too bad.
The marriage certificate?
- It's not here.
- I knew it!
Bernardi, it's not here.
How are you?
Where am I?
- In the hospital at Pergine.
- In the madhouse!
"Abandon every hope
all who enter here".
Quiet!
Where are my clothes, my papers?
The Police have them.
I have to go home,
my son is waiting.
Are you deaf?
My son is Benito Mussolini's
first-born son.
Benito Albino Mussolini.
I'm Benito Mussolini's wife.
And I'm Napoleon's!
- Shut up, or I'll tie you down.
- We are already!
I'll put you in straight jackets.
Fascist!
To arms, we're Fascists...
That's enough!
Stop it!
I'm not joking,
I'll put you in isolation.
Do you know Tatiana Pavlova,
the ballerina?
She was my teacher
and a friend of il Duce's.
Write her.
Stay still!
Cover up.
