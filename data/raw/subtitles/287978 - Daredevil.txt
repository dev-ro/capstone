I'll give you a free shot.

- Hey. Hey, what's that?
- Nothin'.
I told you I didn't
want you fightin'.
[ Sighs ]
I tried to walk away like you said...
but they kept
givin' me shit.
Don't curse.
What kind of shit?
They said that you work for Fallon,
that you're one of his guys now.

Ladies and gentlemen,
we're here today...
to seek truth...
to seek justice.
Mr. Quesada, would you
state for the court...
the sequence of events
leading up to the night ofJune 30?
I stopped off atJosie's Bar
after work.
I had a few drinks.
Angela was there.
She was closing up.
She asked me if I wanted to stick around...
for some fun.
[ Heart Beating ]
Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.
- Are you aware that perjury is a crime,
Mr. Quesada?
- [ Man ] Objection.
My client is a respectable member
of the community, where Miss Sutton...
- has a history of drug and alcohol abuse...
- My client is not on trial.
- which not only makes
her testimony suspect--
- Nor is her testimony suspect.
- Gentlemen, that's enough.
- The truth is...
Mr. Murdock,
is that Miss Sutton--
Miss Sutton enjoyed
every minute of it.
[ Crying ]
Mr. Quesada,
for your sake...
I hope justice
is found here today...
before justice finds you.
Matt? Matt, where
are you going?
Man, we knew this was a risk
going in.
Why? She's from the Kitchen,
she's not from the Upper East Side?
Yeah. Come on, Matt.
She has a history of drug abuse.
- That was a long time ago.
-Juries don't like their victims flawed.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Matt ] It's not right.
Yeah? Here's what
I don't get.
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsch?
He can't. The Kingpin's
gotta be footing the bill.
- Come on. Let's go get drunk.

but it's not like you've
given me any choice.
I mean, it's been
three months now...
and I've never even
seen your apartment.
Every time we sleep together,
I wake up in the morning alone.
I mean,Jesus, where do you go
at 3..00 in the morning?
I thought that if I waited,
if I was patient enough,you'd let me in...
that we'd take our relationship
to the next level.

that this is the next level.

I don't know why
you read that trash.
- I've been hearin' stories for years.
Gotta be somethin' to it.
- Like alligators in the sewers?
There are alligators in the sewers.
I got a friend in Sanitation. He's seen them.
Fine.Just drop it.
You should see this guy.
They got this picture--
- They have a picture?
- It's, like, a drawing, an artist's rendering.
It's just--
It's grotesque.
I'd hate to see this guy's
therapy bills.
Speaking of bills, your client Mr. Lee,
he made his first payment.
- That's great. You should be very happy.
- Yeah, it's fantastic.
He paid in fluke.
Fluke is a fish, Matt.
Did you know that?
I sure as hell didn't.
Mr. Lee is a good man, and he...
doesn't have a lot of money...
and he goes fishing
on the weekends.
I go salsa dancing weekends, but I don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.
Pass the honey, please.
We need some better clients.
I'm tired of these pro bono cases.
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.
Decent people. What's your idea of''better''?
Define ''better.''
- What would be a better client?
- ''Better'' means rich and guilty. Okay?
Remember when they taught us in law
school how to create a moral vacuum...
so you could represent people
who aren't all necessarily innocent?
That was your best course,
as I recall.
You don't have
a moral vacuum.
- You are completely vacuumless.
- [ Laughs ]
And what happened
to your face?
Nothing. A small cut.
I walked into a door.
Every time you disappear,
we can't get ahold of you,
you come in all cut up.
I'm in the fight club.
The first rule of fight club:
Don't talk about fight club.
- You're not in the fight club,
you're out of it.
- I didn't see the movie.
I'm sure it's a funny joke,
but I didn't see it.
Okay, all I'm sayin'
is I'm here for you as a friend.
I hate to bring it up again, but I spent
$3,000 on that Seeing Eye dog.
- I didn't ask you for the dog.
- Can I say something else?
Seeing Eye dogs bond for life--
yours ran away.
What does that tell you about
how emotionally available you are?

- You want the truth?
-Absolutely.

or some sort of

take no further action.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.

- Could you help me out?
- Right in front of you.

- They're writing about the Kingpin.
They're going back
to the beginning.
Oh, I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.
I wanna put all that behind me.
I want you to buy me out.
I think you'll find this
a very generous offer.
So, what do you say?
How's your daughter?
[ Matt ]
I said I was sorry. What do you want?
Details.
You owe me that.
Her name's
Elektra Natchios.
She sounds like
a Mexican appetizer.
It's Greek, genius.
Her father's Nikolas Natchios.
- The billionaire?
- Yeah. See? Yes, the billionaire.
Then as your attorney in this matter,
I advise you to marry the woman immediately.
I'll take it
under consideration.
- What do we got?
- Oh, this one's a real winner.
DaunteJackson,
ex-con from Queens...
charged with the August 9th
murder of Lisa Tazio--
your friendly neighborhood
prostitute.
The bad news is Jackson
was found passed-out in an alley...
holding the murder weapon...
and enough THC in his lungs
to get Staten Island high.
Jackson says he can't remember
what happened on the night of the murder...
or, for that matter,
most of the '90s.
- What's the good news?
- The fluke wasn't bad. Could you let us in?
Mr.Jackson.
Who are you?
We're your attorneys.
If you're innocent.
So, are you...
innocent?
- Yeah.
- [ Heart Beating Normally ]

- You got yourself a defense.

Which makes the fact
that he's innocent interesting.
How can you be
so sure?
- Have I ever been wrong?
- No. Which is really starting to annoy me.

- He is innocent.
then why go through the trouble
to set him up?
Why the big cover-up
in the death of a prostitute?
I don't know.
I can't answer that.
I gotta find out more
about Lisa Tazio.
Well, you know,
too bad we don't have a key.

- Give me your pen.
- Right here. Leave a note?
- Here.

in a ballpoint pen.

Now can we please go

But he did very well for himself

but don't ask me how.

where accused killer
DaunteJackson--

[ Voices Overlapping ]
Ladies and Gentlemen
of the jury...
I am not here to convice you
that DaunteJackson is a model citizen.
He has been in and out
of prisons and reform schools
since he was 1 2 years old...
but this is not a court
of character, however...
This is a court of law.
Isn't he facing
the wrong way?
Don't worry, he's got them
right where he wants them.
- DaunteJackson is innocent.
- Yeah.
And that is what it's been like
for Mr.Jackson.
Like trying to talk
to a wall.
Does this defense come with
a two-drink minimum, Mr. Murdock?
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I'm trying to make a point.
You see,justice is blind...
but it can be heard...
and, today, the truth will come out.
Thank you.

He can't see anything.

- Okay.
Officer McKensie, you were
the arriving officer at the scene?
- That's correct.
- Please tell us what you observed.
I was a block away when I got the call
of shots being fired.
When I arrived on the scene,
Lisa Tazio's body...
was lying dead
on the steps of her apartment.
[ Heart Beating Normally ]
- I found Jackson passed out in the alley.
- [ Beating Continues ]
- Still holding the murder weapon.
- What's wrong?
- Tazio's wallet in his pocket.
- McKensie's telling the truth.

sometimes in court.
No, no, no, no.
Somebody has to be lying.
- What's he doing here?
- Who?
It's Ben Urich,

I'd find you.
