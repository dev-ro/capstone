Ow! My name is Peaches,
Oh, yeah
I'm gettin' money,
oh, yeah
The boys gonna want me,
oh, yeah
But I'm gonna say,
"Ge-ge-get on back
"Ge-ge-get on back"
Ow! Today is the day
That I get my mon-ey,
oh, oh
I'm gonna be a rapper.
Today... let me pour me
some coffee...
gettin' my cash...
- Hello?
- Hey, Peaches.
Hey, girl! What's happening?
Girl, shouldn't you
be gone by now?
Yeah, I'm runnin' a little late,
'cause that's what I do! Ha ha!
What if Nana didn't
leave you no dough?
No, stop trippin',
'cause you know I'm sure...
Nana took care
of her favorite grandbaby.
Angie won't need anything
'cause she won the hair show.
Girl, I know.
Can you believe that heifer won?
Don't hate on Angie.
No, no. I am not hating
on Angie.
All I'm saying is
she would've lost...
had it not been for my design.
You did help her out.
Tell me about it.
She had the nerve...
to offer me 10%
of her winnings. Ha ha!
- Did you take it?
- Hell, yeah, I took it!
But that's beside the point.
Everybody's loving her
because she hit the big one.
Oh, yeah. I heard.
She was on the cover
of "Upscale."
Yeah, I heard.
Miss girl... oh, damn.
Girl, I just sprayed
furniture polish on my dress.
"Salon Sense" is trying
to get at her now.
- Angie came up.
- Yeah, I heard.
She's rollin'.
Miss Girl is just flossin'...
drivin' around in her new car...
in her fresh little car dough.
After today, if I don't
ever see her ass again...
that's fine with me...
- You know better than that...
- Yeah, whatever. Mm-hmm.
And don't you call askin'
for none of my damn money.
- You're crazy. Good-bye.
- Bye! Heh.
Oh. What the hell...
Oh, I done put salt
in my coffee...
I done put furniture polish
on my dress.
Calm it down.
After today, you can get
a maid to pour your shit...
and put your clothes
in the cleaners. Ow!
Angela, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to begin.
OK.
Now, the following
is the last will and...
Whoo! Sorry I'm late, baby.
Traffic.
Ha ha! Uh, Miss Whitaker,
I'm Seymour Gold.
Judging by the looks
of this office...
I'm sure you see more gold
than Master P's dentist.
Ha ha ha!
That was a good one, wasn't it?
Hey, baby. I'm Peaches...
Peaches Whitaker.
Yes, you are. Ha ha ha!
All right.
So I know y'all are ready.
We're gonna get
this thing started...
see what Nana talkin' about.
Lipstick...
- Peaches?
- Uh-huh?
Would you have a seat, please?
Oh, sure, baby. I'm sorry.
Do you, Seymour.
Do you, player.
- Hello, Peaches.
- Angela.
Well, I guess
we'd better dive right in.
We're here to read
the last will and testament...
of your grandmother,
Miss Ruby Whitaker.
"I, Norma Ruby Whitaker...
"do hereby bequeath
the following:
"To my church of fifty years...
Faithful Central Mount Zion...
"Missionary Southern Baptist
Church of God in Christ...
"where the Grand Bishop Reverend
Dr. Marshall Pettaway presides...
"I leave the sum of $50,000."
Uncle Bishop?
Uncle Bishop.
Ain't that a damn shame?
"To my darling granddaughter
Angela...
"keep this family together
and follow your dream.
"I leave the sum of $75,000."
"To my wonderful Peaches..."
Heh heh.
"Once you get wisdom,
you'll have all you desire.
"I leave you
my most prized possession..."
Hmm.
"My Bible."
"Nana Ruby."
That's it?
That's it.
Uh... Seymour...
are you missing a page
up on the will?
No, not that I can tell.
Mm-hmm. You're sure?
As far as I know.
Mm-hmm. Mm.
The Bible.
That's it.
- That's it.
- That's it.
So, uh...
Uh, Mr. Gold... thank you
for an interesting morning.
- Peaches, l...
- Uh!
And would you kindly tell
my perfect sister that...
that she wins again?
I'll take the Bible.
{y:i}Come on and pack your bags
{y:i}And take a trip with me
{y:i}There's more to life
{y:i}than what we see
{y:i}You say the kids
{y:i}won't listen
{y:i}And lately
{y:i}he's been trippin'
{y:i}I think some time away
{y:i}is just what we need
{y:i}I know the place
{y:i}where we can get away
{y:i}Where the sun is shinin'...
Good morning. Angelle's.
Hello, it's Mrs. Cartwright.
Is Jun Ni in?
Uh, no. Not for another hour.
OK, I'd like to book a pedicure.
Ah, one second.
Do you have an 11:00? 11-ish?
- You could see Jun Ni at 11:00.
- Oh, terrific.
OK, I'll put you down.
My pleasure.
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.
Brian, it's ready!
Thank you, baby.
Whoo.
Mm.
Mmm!
What's wrong?
Nothin'. Nothin'.
There's nothin' wrong.
Whew! Look at the time.
I gotta go.
Baby, I'm trying to cook for you
the way you like it.
You sure you don't want
to try one more bite?
Heh heh. Maybe later, OK?
I gotta watch my health...
my shape.
Come on, Jun Ni.
You know I didn't really
marry you for your cooking.
I married you 'cause
you like to try new things.
Right? Right?
This is why I married you.
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Hello?
- Hi, Brian. Is Jun Ni there?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.
OK, now put that out.
I mean, put it up.
OK. Hello?
Hey, Jun Ni.
You have an 11:00 pedicure.
OK.
What's wrong?
Brian hates my cooking.
Trust me, sweetie. He didn't
marry you for your cooking.
You change your mind yet?
No.
Angelle, she your only family.
See you at 11:00, Jun Ni.
The twice-as-sexy
three-time defending champion...
give it to her. Do it! Ow!
In the store, y'all.
Uh, Pierre.
I think I need to get me...
a trophy case
for all my trophies.
Yes, Miss Girl, you are, because
the bamboo sticks are tired.
And your trophies are rolling
over into Miss Debra's area...
and you know she don't have any.
OK, you zip it.
And you need
to get to work on time.
Cuttin' Up
opens at 10:00, OK?
Oh, Miss Debra. I won't lie
to you, girl. I overslept.
And I didn't get breakfast.
OK? Ha ha ha!
Hey, Betty. Hey, Sharina.
Prom do, right, baby?
Yeah, and you know what,
Peaches?
We want to make sure
she gets an elegant chignon.
Come on, baby.
I don't know even know
what a chignon is.
It's the finest
piece of meat you can get.
What?
It come in a big, long tube...
You stupid...
that's "mignon."
Oh, OK.
What you want, baby?
I got the Halle, the Janet...
the Ashanti, the Beyonce...
and if your funds are tight,
the Badu.
Ashanti, that's my girl.
I love her.
Oh, yeah. You're gonna
look real good in that.
Hi, welcome to Cuttin' Up.
I'm Pierre. How can I help you?
I'm looking for
Patrice Elaine Whitaker.
Um... can you... can you
excuse me a minute, baby?
I can take care of it.
Uh, Debra.
I need you to cover for me.
Fill in the hole...
I will not.
You got one in the chair
and three waiting.
You can forget it.
Cover for me.
I said no. And if you even think
about leaving this shop...
you ain't got to worry
about coming back.
I'm Agent Scott,
Internal Revenue Service.
Ooh!
Um... did I say "Pierre"?
My name is Pedro.
I don't even work here.
Pedro. P-e-d-r-o.
Pedro. No habla ingles.
Pierre, where is she?
Um... she sits there.
That's all her shit.
The trophies...
We've got a runner!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey!
What's the rush, Miss Whitaker?
Well, I always run like this...
when a big black man
with one good eye...
and a little white man
in a cheap suit...
come to this part of town.
Sister, you owe the government
$92,000 worth of back taxes!
Baby, that's impossible.
I ain't never even
made $92,000.
Miss Whitaker, we're gonna
put your butt in jail!
Oh, lord! Wait, no, no.
I can't go to jail.
Do you know what they do
to big girls in jail?
They rubs up on 'em
and ties 'em up.
Three or four of them
jump on me at one time.
I don't want to go see R. Kelly.
Can you do something, brother?
Well, that's where
you're gonna go...
if you don't get
your taxes paid, Miss Whitaker!
Whoa. OK, now, look.
Look, now, we can make a deal.
What kind of deal
are you talking about?
OK, brother. See,
I'm talkin' about a hard fifty.
$50,000? Now, that's what
we're talkin' about.
No. Fifty dollars... a month.
And if I do that,
how long is it gonna take...
before I, you know,
pay this whole thing off.
- 37 years!
- Hmm.
But this is your lucky day.
We already met our weekly quota.
So we're gonna cut you a deal.
Now, we want $50,000 in 60 days.
We'll call this matter even.
If I do fifty in sixty...
I don't have to do five to ten.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
OK, we can make that deal,
player. And you...
you're gonna get
these handcuffs off me.
Ou need to get you some.
I'm not into this freaky shit
you're bringin' here.
I don't do white men.
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?
- Miss Whitaker!
- What?!
I'm watching you.
With what eye?
'Cause that one can
get away from your ass.
- Aaaah!
- Don't talk about his eye!
You better get out of here!
Get out of here!
Hello?
Oh, uh...
Peaches Whitaker, please?
Peaches is not here.
No Peaches here.
Oh, um... can you tell her
Jun Ni called...
to confirm
she receive invitation...
to her sister
anniversary party?
Oh. I won't be there.
Oh, well, that's too bad.
I know she was looking forward
to seeing you.
- Really?
- Yes.
She made a plane reservation
for you...
on American Airlines
for Friday morning.
- First class?
- No.
- Refundable?
- No.
Oh. Well, let Miss Whitaker know
I can't make it.
Do you have problems
with the I.R.S.?
Oh! I gotta get out of here!
Whoo! Los An-ge-les!
Yes!
Hello, Miss Whitaker.
I'm Agent Ross.
Ooh! You look
just like my girl!
I get it all the time.
I know... Serena Williams.
You look like my girl Bubbles
in Baltimore.
She was a stripper.
Go, Bubbles!
Look, Miss Whitaker.
I'm with the I.R.S.
Oh!
Get in the car. Let's go.
Get in the car. Come on.
- Get in the car!
- Aw, shut the hell up...
you double-necked
"Blue's Clues" wannabe.
Yeah, but you're tore up
from the floor up...
make a young player
wanna throw up.
- No, it don't.
- Yeah, it do.
And you, sexy chocolate...
And you, sexy chocolate...
thicker than a bowl of oatmeal,
cleaner than Clorox.
Where can I take you?
Talk to me. I talk back.
Tell me somethin'
slick and sly.
Is that how you talk
to women, Mr. Simms?
I thought you thought
I'm a jigga there.
Mr. Benjamin Simms...
1212 Elkway Place. Hmm?
Let's see... cab driver by day,
wannabe baller by night.
- Double-necked baller.
- Shut up. How you know all that?
I.R.S. We know everything.
Ooh! I like you, sister.
Whatever, Miss Whitaker.
Now, listen...
you have 58 days to pay us.
Not 59, not 591/2.
Understand me?
Yes.
And if you are so much
as one minute late...
we're gonna lock you up,
take any money you have...
will have, or ever have.
Understood?
Leave me alone.
Now that my work here is done...
Benjamin, go ahead
and take me to the spot.
I'm ready to get my mack on.
I got the perfect spot.
It'll be crackin' over this way.
- To the spot?
- Yeah, to the spot.
That's code
for "stripper joint!"
I knew you was Bubbles!
Ha ha ha!
I'm Agent Ross.
I ain't Bubbles.
Agent Ross, a.k.a. Bubbles!
You lost a little bit of weight.
That's what threw me off.
You took me to that club
Chunky Asses back in Baltimore.
Little dance spot. You had
to be a size 14 or better.
You taught me how
to go around that pole!
I left Bubbles in Baltimore.
Now, come on! New life for me.
Whoo! Bubbles' in the house!
Come on, do that move.
Do that move you showed me.
Bubbles' in the house!
Ah, ah!
Bubbles' in the house!
Ah, ah!
- Bubbles' in the house!
- Girl, you crazy.
Agent Bubbles Ross, girl,
you ain't got to front with me.
I'm proud of you, sister.
- Hi.
- Hey, y'all.
Ain't this some L.A. Mess?
Valet parking at a hair salon.
Ha ha ha!
Angelle's? What in the...
That'll be
fifty-five-fiznifty, ma.
- What?
- Five-five-five.
- 55.50?
- You heard me.
Brother,
that was a half-hour ride.
Look, I'm not tryin' to put
shoes on your baby's feet.
Aw, don't get it twitty.
I ain't really gotta be
drivin' this...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever. Look...
um, I'm a little short on cash.
You're a lotta short.
Pay me or pay me no attention.
Come up off my yaper.
OK, papa, look, I'm just gonna
run in here and get some money.
- No yaper, no bag.
- Hold up, player.
You not settin'
to drive off with my stuff.
Tear that off.
It ain't like I'm gonna wear it.
I don't know why not.
You look like one of them
big, fat, old drag queens...
be down on Hollywood and Sunset.
I watched HBO, now.
Don't get your ass whooped.
Tear that shit off,
mother love.
Give me the bag.
That "mother love"
was disrespectful.
You just wait here. I'm comin'
right back with the money, pimp.
- I'm gonna wait.
- Yeah.
- Mother love.
- Yeah.
- May I take your bag?
- No, you can't take my damn bag!
Why does everybody want
my bag in L.A.? Oh.
Hi.
Oh, good morning, Stronjay.
Ha ha!
Ooh, hey, sis.
What can we do for you?
Can you let Angela know
her sister's here?
Heh. No, really. Who are you?
Just let Angela know I'm here.
I didn't know Angelle
had a sister.
Peaches, you made it.
I'm Jun Ni!
Oh, hey, Jun Ni.
How you doin', doll?
Good, good.
How was your flight?
My flight was wonderful,
but that cab driver...
I'm gonna slap him in his mouth.
He's messing with
the wrong girl.
- Peaches!
- Angie!
Ha ha ha!
Peaches,
what are you doing here?
Girl, what you mean,
what I'm doing here?
- You invited me.
- No, I didn't.
Yes, Miss Girl, you did. Hello.
- Jun Ni?
- Uh, yes?
Explain.
Oh, OK, OK.
Uh, I sent for your sister...
but only because
you're so stubborn!
Life is short.
Blood is thicker than water.
You are family. Sister Sledge.
OK.
- OK.
- OK.
Well...
welcome to L.A.
Ah ha ha! Thank you, boo!
My big sister! Listen, could you
loan me some cab fare...
so I can pay the cab, 'cause
he won't give me my things.
Don't worry. I pay for cab.
All right, thank you, precious.
She's so sweet.
Uh... well, um...
everybody,
this is my sister Peaches.
Peaches, this is everybody.
Hey, everybody.
Peaches.
Sis, aren't you
forgetting someone?
No, that's everybody.
Well, where's Angelle?
Ha ha ha!
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
You need to stop playing, Angie.
An... gelle.
Miss Angelle, you dropped
a bone out the closet.
You get back to work.
Follow me.
Angie, you got a lot of
white people up in here.
You got liquors and wines
up in the shop!
- Don't do that.
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby girl.
Take it down a notch.
Morning.
Hey. I see you've become
a real L.A. Girl.
Well, it's hard work
running a business...
and trying to stay fit.
You look like
you've been working out.
Thanks. I try.
This is, um,
really a nice place.
Business must be
going well for you.
I'm doing all right.
How are things back at home?
Good. Things couldn't be better.
Why you lookin' at me
like I want something?
Stop looking at me
like I stole your future.
- Traitor.
- Quitter.
- Freak.
- Hood rat.
- Sell out.
- Tramp!
- Skank!
- Triflin'!
- Heifer!
- Field hand!
Whoo!
Wow. That was refreshing. Ha ha!
Oh, and... Peaches?
I know we've had
our differences...
but I'm really glad
you're here.
Yeah, me, too.
Mm-hmm. That's the L.A. Way.
- Miss Baltimore.
- It's the B-more way.
Squish it around like that...
hit it again with a little bit
of lemon juice, like that.
- You ready? You ready?
- I'm ready.
Bring it.
- Don't cheat!
- Bring it.
One... two... three!
Whoo!
Mmm mmm mmm! Mmm!
Put the food on the plate!
That's right. Let me put some
on yours, all right?
This chicken is good!
You act like you've
never eaten before!
I sure ain't never had
no chicken like this.
We have chicken at home.
Stop it!
Come on, man. This is it.
Come on!
Girl, what is up with those two?
Chill, a hot-ass mess.
Ha ha ha ha!
They got married
a month after they met.
He shops for her clothes,
does her hair...
and Jun Ni waxes
both their legs... together...
so you tell me.
Mmm. Trying to cover it up.
I know one when I see one.
- Maybe it's love.
- Maybe she's a he.
Homey need to come
out the closet...
'cause I can see his feet.
Feel me, B?
So he's a little effeminate,
loves fashion...
gets his nails done
and his legs waxed.
- So does that mean he's gay?
- Hell, yeah!
So homophobic.
With them big ol' feet
hangin' off those shoes.
You know that's a wig.
Here they come.
Hi, Miss Thing!
I like your hair!
Ooh, man! Hee hee!
Ooh, what is she doing here?
- Who is that?
- Trouble.
That's Marcella Hunter,
the hair show diva.
And Fiona the faithful flunky.
Damn, Marcella is fine.
Wait a minute. What hair show?
You might want to bring
that back a couple notches...
'cause I hear she has mob ties
and her husband vanished.
You know what I heard?
I heard he actually ran away...
'cause he was tired of
his wife's big mouth.
Excuse me, Miss Girl,
what hair show?
The hair show
that Angelle doesn't do.
OK, and this year
first prize is fifty Gs.
Fifty Gs for a hair show?
Not a hair show. The hair show.
The Hair Battle Royale.
Ooh, and one Angelle
won't let us into...
because we are here to improve
the state of black hair...
Not exploit it,
and that's final!
Girl, fifty Gs? We're doing
that hair show. Uh-huh.
These five years have been
challenging, rewarding...
and difficult.
In these times, I am grateful
for the blessings...
the success...
but I couldn't have done
any of that...
without all of you.
So thank you all
so very much for coming.
Congratulations, Angelle!
Marcella. What a surprise.
You didn't think I'd miss
my protegee's big night?
Oh, come on! Ha ha ha!
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Oh, no.
Can I get a real shot
for "Black Styles"?
Ladies, you can do
better than that.
Hi, Cliff.
You have to excuse me, Marcella.
I have something
to take care of.
Angelle, you look
beautiful as always.
Now, can I get a money shot
for "Black Style"? Please?
Thank you.
So why is it that the only woman
I've called for a full month...
hasn't returned
any of my phone calls?
I've been busy, Cliff.
You've been busy?
So what you're saying is...
"I don't want
to be bothered, Cliff."
"Good-bye, Cliff." Right?
No, what I'm saying is,
I've been busy, Cliff.
OK. So when do you think
you'll be un-busy?
Yeah, OK.
Ooh! Thank you, baby.
I'm gonna get
something to drink.
Hey, baby.
Let me get
a passion fruit Alize martini.
Ooh, all right.
Already made up.
- Here you are.
- Mmm.
Whassup, big dog.
Let me have a Hennessy, man.
Give me something to the right.
Mmm. That's good.
Now to the left.
- Ha ha ha!
- How you doing?
I'm Cliff
for "Black Styles" Magazine.
Peaches.
- Peaches?
- Mm-hmm.
You're not from around here,
huh, Peaches?
- Baltimore all day.
- Oh! Baltimore in the house.
Let's show these L.A. Girls
how you do it.
Well, it is refreshing.
Are you and Angelle friends?
No. Uh-uh. Now, listen...
be sure to shoot me
at a 45-degree angle down...
left side dominant
with an F-stop 2-8.
You know a little something
about photography, huh?
I know a little something
about being photographed.
Excuse me!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?
Well, I just want
to take this moment...
to say, "Thank you, Angelle!"
Oh, let's give her a hand.
Yes! Yes! That's it.
Ohh! Just think...
five years ago...
she was nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, and now,
she has managed all this.
Ohh, I have to say,
I am proud of you, girl.
I taught you well.
What do you say we make
this year's hair battle...
a little more interesting?
I challenge you to enter...
and to prove
to the whole world...
that I am truly worthy of being
the five-time recipient...
of the Golden Head.
So what do you say, Ange?
Come on!
Hmm?
I gotta go.
Let's "Sou"/ "Tra"/"n" for my sister.
Oh, yeah, girl.
Go, Angela.
Go take your place. Yeah!
Shake your thing, girl!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Go, Peaches! Go, Peaches!
Go, Peaches! Go, Peaches!
Go, Peaches! Go, Peaches!
Ow!
Go, Peaches! Go, Peaches!
Go, Peaches! Go, Peaches!
Oh, yeah!
Oh! Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ahh ha ha ha!
- Ohh.
- Ahh.
Sis, you sure know
how to throw a party, girl.
Whew. Well, thank you.
Oh, when does
your flight leave?
Uh, tomorrow, 3 P.M.
Uh...
Girl, Nana should've been
ashamed of herself!
But wait. Look at this batch.
The Soul-Glo curls.
Ha ha! Take it away.
Ha ha!
Ooh. Remember when
you fell in the pool?
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Correction... I did not
fall in that pool.
Little nappy-haired
Ricky Smith...
pushed me in the pool,
and I almost drowned.
Ah, you did not almost drown.
You need to stop
tellin' that story.
In three feet.
Two feet. Kiddie pool.
Don't do that.
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
Girl, I need $50,000.
Ha ha ha!
What?
OK, listen.
I owe the I.R.S. $50,000...
and if I don't pay 'em
in sixty days...
they're gonna put me
up in the jail.
That's what they told me.
They're gonna lock me up.
Ooh.
Oh, wait a minute. Mm-mm.
Same old Peaches.
Angie, listen...
if you lend me
the 50,000, right...
I can pay you back when I win
the, um, Hair Battle Royale.
I am doing well,
but I'm not doing that well.
I don't have $50,000
in a duffel bag.
And what hair battle
are you talking about?
The one Tiffany
was telling me about.
She said y'all do it
every year.
And this year,
the winner gets $50,000!
No. Those things are classless
and unimaginative.
OK, Angie, listen.
Check this out...
OK, we can win this thing.
Now, I have won a hair show
3 years in a row in Baltimore.
No.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Look, I don't have
50,000 to give you.
But I will give you a job
and a place to stay.
Me work for you?
Girl, hell no. Huh.
I can do that back in B-more.
Well, then take your ass
back to B-more and the I.R.S.
Well, that wasn't nice. Damn.
Hollywood has changed her.
You got your tools?
Not all of them.
I hadn't planned on staying.
All right, girl,
you can use mine.
Thank you.
How's the sitcom?
And Josh? That's too bad.
She already
on husband number two.
Oh.
And you're already
on strike number two.
Watch your mouth.
Peaches, you take the walk-ins.
Yessuh, boss!
I'sa take all da walk-ins!
Just please,
don't beat me no more, massa!
- Oh! Ha ha ha ha!
- Run, Kizzy!
Ha ha ha ha!
- I can't run.
- Run, Kizzy!
I'm gonna split y'all up.
That's what I thought.
I'd have been free.
I'd have told on you.
I'd have said...
"Tiff is over there
in the bush."
Ha ha ha ha!
"She ain't...
Come on out, Tiff!
"They caught us!"
Simone.
Your appointments are waiting.
That's Fake-me-out
Mother Earth.
Incense, colonics, herbs...
all that shit.
She says she wanna sing.
Well, can she sing?
I don't know.
All she does is that.
Oh, girl. That's my cue.
Go work it out.
Hey, ladies.
Welcome to Angelle's.
What can I hook
y'all up with today?
L... we... want to get
our hair done.
Look, come on over
to my station...
and let me break you off
a little somethin' proper...
somethin' real nice.
Ha ha ha!
Good morning.
Welcome to Angelle's.
- Is everything OK?
- Everything's wonderful.
The ladies at
the Junior League said...
this would be a nice place
to get, you know, spruced up.
Heh. Why, certainly.
We can take you now.
Peaches is available...
or you can wait or come back.
And when are you available?
Around 3:00.
Good. We'll be back at 3:00.
- L...
- I know.
But did she say "spruced"?
- She did. It's the area.
- "Spruced"?
- I know.
You'll get used to it. Ha ha!
Oh, my goodness.
"Spruced up."
I'm comin'!
God, girlfriend. I'm comin'.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Afternoon.
Tiffany's been waiting for you.
Put it back.
- Hater.
- Thank you.
My girl Myesha told me
she saw that old stank ho...
down the club
gettin' her freak on.
Uh-uh.
Then I heard she was kickin' it
with his best friend...
when the man was out of town.
John Salley.
The one that used to play
for the Lakers?
Girl, I'm tryin' to tell you.
If John Salley was my man,
I'd be, like...
Oh, please. John Salley?
He don't want
no big-mouthed hoochie like you.
So you could just talk...
and put all your business
out on Front Street.
You know what?
Instead of worrying...
about what's goin' on over here,
you need to call to make sure...
you still have that appointment
at the free clinic.
'Cause I seen you
around here scratchin'.
- Oh.
- What's that about?
See? That's why
you ain't got no man.
'Cause don't nobody want
to hear all that.
Whatever, Drake. Don't nobody
feel like hearin'...
- about your hos all day.
- They're not my hos, though.
They're paying customers.
Ohh, well, I talked to your
paying customers...
and they said size does matter.
{y:i}Eenie-meenie,
{y:i}teeny-weenie
{y:i}Ooh-ah-ah-chamini
{y:i}It's so small,
{y:i}it can't go
{y:i}All up on chawini
- That's funny.
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
That's real funny.
'Cause, you know...
all my clients know
that a brother is packin'.
I could give you
a couple of customers.
- I don't need your customers.
- Mine pay more.
But you only have two, boy.
If you were packin',
you'd have more.
Hey. How you doin', Shelly?
Just have a seat over here.
All right?
I'll be with you in a second.
Drake, Rashan's here
for her 5:30.
Oh.
I need you to do me
a big favor.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm booked, player.
You're on your own.
Ooh! She's booked, player.
Talk-a to the hand!
Ha ha ha!
Cool. Ain't nothin'
but a thang.
Rashan, I'll be with you
in a second.
Just have a seat.
It's not a problem.
OK.
Girl, watch this.
He's gonna walk
ho number one to the back...
while ho number two
waits up front.
- What?
- Mm-hmm.
You gotta respect
his little game.
He got a little bit of game.
Must be nice to roll
out the bed at 10:00...
roll up in here at 11:00,
and only do two heads a day.
Well, how does he
make a living?
Baby, they pay $500 a pop
to sit in that fool's chair.
What?
Girl, they're silly broads.
Silly broads.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Anyway, watch this.
Come here. Come here,
come here, come here.
Now, he's about to, uh...
sweet talk ho number two
and walk her out front.
That's it.
He's done with her.
Damn, he got it like that?
Mm-mm. He ain't done yet, girl.
Here comes the big finish.
Kiss on the forehead.
Wait a minute, boo.
Not so fast. Come back.
Always get the money.
Don't never let 'em
leave with the money.
That way,
they got to come back.
Gotta give it to him, though.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'...
he got game.
Little bit. He a'ight.
- Ho.
- Hater.
You better give me
that $20 you owe me, punk.
Hello?
How are you gonna pay your taxes
if you don't have any clients?!
Who is this?
- The I.R.S.
- Damn!
We're watching you.
Time is running out.
Come on down to Angelle's
and ask for Peaches.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Who gave you permission
to work on my corner?
Excuse me, Green Hornet...
but I didn't know
this was your corner.
All you gotta do is look around,
look around, look around.
This is my town.
I'm Lime Pimp, baby.
Check this out, Lime Pimp.
Why don't you take
this here from me?
I'll do your hair and her hair
for half-price.
Here you go, sister.
Tell all your friends
to come on in.
I'll do your hair,
do somebody else's for free.
Damn! That's a done deal.
But look here, if this
hair thing don't work out...
you can always come work for me.
Let's go, ladies.
Do I have enough money
to buy her out?
Marcella, she won't sell.
Maybe I'll just kill her.
No. Too messy.
Oh. I could just...
scare her a little.
Peaches, when I say
this is incredible...
it's crazy.
You gotta try it.
- Yeah, take a taste.
- Wh-what is it?
It's black-eyed piss.
Baby, I don't do piss.
No, it's black-eyed peas.
Peas.
Yeah, that's what I said.
Peaches, taste.
That's an acquired taste.
You gotta just gargle it,
let it marinate.
That is disgusting!
Ha ha ha!
Very funny, Drake.
Yeah, very funny.
You could've warned a sister.
Boy, if you weren't so cute,
I'd whup her ass.
Peaches, how am I supposed
to get better...
if no one will help me?
OK, Jun Ni. I guess if I can
teach Angela how to cook...
you won't be a problem.
Ohh, Peaches!
Yeah! Peaches gonna help me!
Yeah, but do me a favor.
Don't you make nary
another pot of piss.
Now, go put that away.
That tastes like shit.
- OK.
- Ha ha ha!
I'm gonna get you back, Drake!
Bottom line...
any black woman...
can have a head full
of long, healthy hair...
as long as they stop abusing it.
That's why I don't do weaves.
Our hair is beautiful, Peaches.
It's strong and thick,
the way God intended.
See, that is the problem.
We need to stop accepting...
Western society's
beauty standards.
You need to start embracing
a straightening comb.
But it's that diversity that
makes black hair so beautiful.
Straight hair, braids,
dreads, corn rows, afros...
it's all about
the flavor, sister.
I'm just saying
it should be natural.
See, my hair reflects
my African heritage.
{y:i}Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu
How come everybody
want to act...
like they're down
with the cause...
just because they be puttin'
seashells and beads and nuts...
and soy and salad
all up in their hair?
That don't make no sense, man.
Stay positive.
Let them do what they want.
Like, for hair,
if I like corn row...
I wear corn row.
The only reason why
you wear "corn row"...
is 'cause you got a brother
on your arm.
If you didn't have a brother,
you wouldn't have no "corn row."
Ooh.
Brother on my arm.
No brother on your arm.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
Ohh!
At least I know
how to fry chicken.
I know how fry chicken!
No! You know how fry noodle!
I make noodle good, too,
you know.
Not just the chicken.
But I can make all things.
- I make corn on the cob...
- No corn on the cob.
I do! And I make,
uh, potatoes and greens.
Ha ha ha!
That's why sisters are starting
to date more white men...
because they seemingly
treat us like ladies.
Please. Like that white boy...
that was kissin' Halle
on the Academy Awards?
White, black, blue,
green, whatever.
Any man would've kissed
Halle Berry.
She's one of the finest women
on the planet.
That white boy
was kissin' Halle Berry...
because he saw her naked behind
on "Monster's Ball."
He wouldn't not kissed
Vivica Fox...
Angela Bassett,
or Cicely Tyson like that...
'cause they would've whipped
his white ass on national TV.
You don't suck up
on a sister like that...
all up in the mouth on the TV.
Ha! See you next week.
- Ellen, I'm ready for you.
- All right.
Uh, Ria, come here, baby.
I think I see something wrong
with your ends.
She didn't do what I think
she just did, did she?
- I'm not in it.
- That's a fight right there.
I'll take Peaches.
You know,
Angela pretty strong, too.
She is.
I love it.
You're gonna be here
next week, right?
Yes, ma'am. Ha ha!
Ooh, thank you, Miss Girl. Yes.
Have a seat at my station.
{y:i}I rock that,
{y:i}oh, yeah, oh, yeah
{y:i}I rock that, ow!
{y:i}I rock that, oh, yeah, oh...
Oh, really? You just
had to flex, didn't you?
I was just trying to help.
Did you see her face?
Girl, she loved it.
Do you see my face?
Beauty shop 101...
you never touch
another stylist's style.
Beauty shop 202...
you never let a client leave...
for less than they paid for.
Look, Peaches.
I'm not playin' with you.
- You will not do...
- Angelle, clients can hear.
Besides, there's somebody
here to see you.
I'm not finished with you.
Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you gotta be
so mean to me? Ha ha!
Cliff, uh, hi.
What are you doing here?
Hey, um, you know something?
I just came by to bring
the pictures from the party.
Oh, OK. Uh...
thank you.
I have a customer.
I'll see you later.
All right. No problem.
Hey, uh, whassup, Tiffany?
Hey.
- Peaches.
- Hey, Cliff.
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine, baby.
I got some nice pictures
of you from the party, too.
Ooh!
Ha!
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
Ooh-ooh.
Ooh.
- There.
- Ohh.
You like?
Cliff, these are really nice.
You know,
I had a real nice subject.
- Excuse me.
- Huh? Sorry.
I thought you told me that you
and Angelle weren't friends.
We're not. We're sisters.
Excuse me. Tiffany, can I
help you with something, baby?
I was... can I use this?
OK, go ahead
and take that, too.
So you don't need to come
back over here again.
Listen, Peaches, um,
here's my card...
and if you ever need
some photos...
- I can use a sexy subject.
- OK.
- You might take me up on that?
- That's fine with me.
It was nice seeing you.
- You, too, baby.
- All right.
Nice seeing you, hater.
I mean, Tiffany.
- Angelle.
- Yeah.
My car is blocked again.
Headhunters!
It's gonna be on.
You stay right here.
I'll be right back.
- I want to go!
- Stay here!
Let me go! Miss Angelle,
I got your back!
You doing OK?
Hey, Angelle.
Fiona, I need to speak
to Marcella.
OK, sure.
Marcella to the front, please.
Marcella to the front.
Girl, is that a cappuccino bar?
- Oh, it's all right.
- Exactly.
They need an Alize bar
up in here.
Oh, Angelle. And...
My client is blocked in again.
Oh. New valets.
Come. Come, come, come.
I want to show you something.
Now... this one...
Oh.
Or this one?
Now, I rather prefer
this one myself.
Wouldn't you agree, Angelle?
Marcella, really,
I don't have time for this.
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of it
right away.
No, thank you.
Oh, thank you, baby.
That's so nice.
Heh.
Ah.
You pathetic little hood rat.
Well, clean it up, now!
I'm sorry. Look,
I'll get you another one.
No, baby, it's OK.
You know, you might want...
to think about standing up
for yourself.
Actually, you saved me a trip.
For you.
I think you'll find it
more than generous.
Well, go ahead. Take one.
Perhaps you can
convince Angelle...
of the benefits
of coming in second.
Oh, no, baby.
Never second. Always first.
Well, Marcella. Not interested.
Thank you for
handling the parking...
and, as always,
it's been a pleasure. Peaches?
Angelle, be reasonable.
Miss Girl, know your place...
Second.
One of us has to go.
Slow down. Girl,
what was that all about?
She wants me
to sell my shop to her.
Not on your life.
Wait a minute. Sell your shop?
Girl, how much?
Peaches.
OK, I'm sorry, sister.
Just a moment of weakness.
Ohh, the nerve of that woman.
Ooh, if she just
treated people better...
then maybe she wouldn't be
losing all of her clients.
OK, but, Angie,
what about this hair battle?
Now, I mean, she is good,
but, girl, we can take her.
Did you see her designs?
I can do that in my sleep.
Comic book sketches.
Right, so, I mean,
we gonna do that?
- Angelle.
- Cliff.
Peaches, nice to see you.
I told you, not right now.
No, actually,
I came back here for Peaches.
I just got a call
from the office...
and my assistant hairstylist
cancelled...
for tomorrow's shoot, so I was
wondering if you were available.
I figured you were busy.
So what do you say?
We pay cash.
Heh. It's not like
I don't have the time.
I'm shooting one of
my celebrity clients.
Well, I will be there.
- Will you?
- Yes.
I'll pick you up
at 7 A.M. Sharp. Is that cool?
- OK, baby. Yep.
- All right.
Angela.
Cliff.
Girl, that boy is stuck on you.
Not my type.
Peaches, your 1:00 appointment
Miss Fox is here.
Peaches, now,
I came down to the hood...
because all my girls said
you could hook it up.
Can I tell you?
I am speechless right now.
Sister, I love you.
Watched all your movies...
"Independence Day"...
you rocked that.
Little stripper goin'
'round the pole like that!
Give it, give it,
give it, give it! Ha ha!
"Two Can Play That Game"...
Morris Chestnut... what?
- Fine.
- Any day of the week.
Fi-ine!
Baby, I would do him...
{y:i}Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
{y:i}Thursday, Friday...
Peaches. Now, look, baby.
I got a big premiere
tonight, OK?
So I need you to give me
a touch-up...
hook up my kitchen for me,
all right?
Oh, sister,
I am going to lay... you... out.
All right.
There you go.
Oh, Peaches. Oh, I love it.
Girl, you gonna
have me lookin'...
like a black Jessica Rabbit
tonight.
Fabulous.
Yes. Told you
I was gonna rock that.
I mean, Peaches,
you really did your thing, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.
Just... Oh, lord.
I mean, you hooked up
my kitchen, girl.
- I mean, what can I say?
- I hooked it up.
The relaxer that you used
just got it so silky.
Yeah. So silky.
- Peaches?
- Hmm?
What is... what is this?
Oh. Oh, that... that... that...
that's dead ends.
It's dead ends in your hair.
Yeah. See,
I have some, too, but...
Oh! Dead ends?!
This looks like a whole hell of
a lot more than dead ends!
- Look, l...
- Uhh!
You're an idiot!
You are gonna blow my premiere
for me, you silly-ass idiot!
OK, now, uh...
- Oh, God!
- Miss Vivica...
now, not gonna be too many more
"stupid-ass idiots."
Now, I said I can fix it.
To hell with that premiere.
You're gonna watch your mouth.
It's falling out everywhere!
Well, I said I was sorry.
But you're gonna stop
all that name-calling...
before you get your ass
whupped up in here.
Ohh... I'm gettin' ready to
kick your ass for certain now.
Come on, come on.
Let me see what kind
of juice you got!
Come on with it! Come on!
Whoa! Oh! Whoa!
Ohh!
Oh! Oh...
Bring it.
Peaches, that hurt.
Yeah, well...
you never know me.
You never know me.
I hope you don't expect a tip.
Hey... well...
- But take that!
- Oh!
- Ohh...
- Gotcha.
Oh! Hooo!
She don't know me. As soon as
I get my foot fixed...
I swear for God
I'm comin' out to California.
I'm gonna whup your ass.
I'm gonna whup your ass.
Ohh... she play too hard.
- Hello?
- Miss Whitaker.
- Who is this?
- Agent Little!
The I.R.S. Callin',
this bitch is hatin' on me.
I ain't got no money!
Ohh, she knew her damn hair
couldn't take that kind of perm.
Don't try to be mad
with me. Shit.
Right here. Set it up here.
This looks good.
OK, good. Thank you.
Good. That's a good place.
That's good.
You like the wispy little tails?
I love it. I love it.
Do you like it?
You think it's last season?
Oh, no, baby. The shag is back
And it's fabulous, darling.
Hey, everybody!
Um, are you Zora?
- Yes.
- Hey, Zora. I'm Peaches.
"Black Style" hired me
to be your assistant.
- What you need me to do?
- Stay out of my way.
Oh, OK, baby... ooh!
- Peaches?
- Huh?
- Turn that off.
- I'm sorry, baby.
One would really think
you would know better.
Yes, ma'am, I do, honey.
Hey, you are that mod...
Roshumba?!
Hey, girl!
I love you, sister girl!
You be rockin' that thang!
Do not encourage her.
Peaches, fall back, all right?
This is a professional
environment.
Yes, ma'am, it is, Miss Girl.
Zora... Zora, do you like
the earrings with this?
Well, you know what?
The earrings are funky...
Nobody asked you, Peaches.
OK, but they just don't go
with the shoes real good.
That precious red... don't rock
those gold shoes, baby.
- Rock the red shoes.
- You don't like the shoes?
Set it off!
Set it on fire! Bam!
Roshumba, why are you
entertaining someone...
who's wearing floral pants?
Ha ha ha! So last season.
Look, sweetie,
what I'm gonna do...
is I'm gonna let you
set for a moment...
And then I'll come back
and touch up the ends.
- OK.
- All right.
- Ciao ciao.
- Bye!
Uh, Roshumba? Girl,
you just got a little spot...
right in the back there
on your ends.
If you let me do it, baby,
I will tighten that up.
There's a spot? Where?
Yes!
Hey! Look here, player.
Where's Peaches?
Whoo!
I need my hair done!
Whoa!
Beverly Hills, my behind!
May I help you?
I'm the proprietor
of this establishment.
- Yeah, well, get me the owner.
- I am the owner.
Oh. Well, me and my crew...
we here for this
"buy one, get one free"...
early bird special right here.
And we got our own hair
and everything.
I don't do weaves.
What? What you mean
you don't do no weaves?
I don't do weaves.
Well, somebody up in this joint
better start weaving...
or else I'm gonna
jump off up in here.
Whoo!
I've got four heads
I'm handling over here.
You have to handle these
little hood rats yourself.
No, he didn't!
If you ain't weavin',
you need to be leavin'.
Jun Ni, where all
these people come from?
Peaches' client,
and she no here.
Peaches' clients?
My people, my people.
Ooh!
RuPaul wannabe,
I know you ain't talkin' to me.
Make yourself comfortable.
You got your people mixed up.
Hey! All right! God!
Angelle, what do we do?
Jun Ni, you handle the front.
Simone, you take
the twists and the braids.
Gianni, you take
the color and the perms...
- Tiffany, the weaves.
- What about me?
- Drake...
- I already got...
Drake, I need you
to manage the shampoo line.
Excuse me! Hello? Hello?
When's somebody
gonna start doing...
what this paper say
right here?
This flyer say
"Buy one, get one free."
I'm here for my free,
so where's it at?
What's going on?
Excuse me, missy?
Look, you need to stop
all that switchin'...
and start stitchin', OK?
What you think?
Wow, Peaches, this is amazing!
Ha ha ha!
I am so glad you like it.
I added a couple tracks in it
to give it fullness and flair.
- Excuse me!
- It's gorgeous.
What in the hell
is going on here?
Oh, Zora, don't be mad.
Peaches was just trying to help.
All right, Zora, listen,
I'm ready to go.
Is everybody ready?
What do you think
about the hair?
The hair's nice. Look at you.
All right!
I'll be ready in just a second.
I just need a little powder.
All right, let's go make magic.
Ooh, thank you so much.
- Mwah!
- Mwah!
Ha ha ha!
OK, here we go.
Baby! You can make hundreds.
Hundreds and fifty in an hour.
That's after my cut.
Ooh, your hair is so pretty!
Thank you.
- Where'd you get it?
- Genetics.
Oh! Isn't that that
new hair supply shop...
over off of Normandie and Third?
What?
Yeah, I gotta go there
and get me some.
Let me write that down.
Here's my card.
Think about the offer.
Coach? Rolex?
What's this?
Angelle! Ugh!
Who is that?
Oh! Ooh!
Here. Rub some of that on there.
God damn!
Welcome to Angelle's.
How can I help you?
It's "May I help you?"
And you may not.
I have an appointment
with Angelle.
Oh, well,
Angelle's a little busy...
but I could definitely
hook you up.
My name is Drake.
Mona. Mona Morgan's the name.
Now, when you say that
you can hook me up...
are you saying that
I'm in some way unhooked?
No. No.
Speak up, son.
I was just saying, like,
I could do your hair for you...
if you like, ma'am.
Then why on earth
didn't you say that?
That's excellent. Now, listen...
I need a touch-up...
but my scalp
is extremely sensitive.
And now I'll need a notepad and
a cup of strawberries, please.
OK. Why don't you have
a seat over here...
and I'll be right with you.
Look like mack daddy done
finally met his match.
Oh, child, please,
she is way out of his league.
He used to dealin' with them
tacky ghetto broads.
You know what,
can I get you a glass of wine?
It's "May I get you
a glass of wine?"
Thank you. You may.
Since you know
my whole life story...
All right.
Why don't you tell me about the
mysterious Clifford J. Walker?
- The mysterious, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- It's all like that?
- Ha ha!
Let's see, I started modeling
when I was 14.
Started shooting photos at 17.
Married a supermodel at 25.
Burnt out at 27,
divorced at 30.
3 years single,
2 years celibate...
No kids, one dog,
and a partridge in a pear tree.
Huh. That's me.
So, um... what's up
with you and Angela?
Angela's cool people.
I like her, but, um,
it's not like that.
But when I saw you...
it was like
a breath of fresh air.
And I just want to get
to know you, Peaches.
Girl, I look good.
It looks wonderful!
Thank you.
Oh, I am so glad Myesha
referred me to you.
Oh, Myesha, girl, that's my main
apple scrapple right there.
How do you know her?
Girl, me, Myesha, and Stephanie,
we used to hang, OK?
You talkin' about
Stephanie Salley...
John Salley's wife?
Yes!
Oh, brother, she a trip.
What you heard about her?
First of all, I heard she slept
with half the NBA...
before John got to her.
No, you didn't.
I heard they call her
"Loose booty butt."
Ha ha ha! You crazy!
That's how we do it.
All right, baby. See you later.
Hey... no hug?
I had a good time.
- I'll see you, right?
- Holler!
I'm in a daze.
Hey, everybody,
what happened up in here?
Your "buy one, get one free"
early birds flew in.
Ooh!
While you were out
gallivanting at a photo shoot...
we were here handling
your clients.
I was out trying
to build up our clientele.
You've been here
less than a week...
and again you have managed
to turn my world upside down.
I've managed?
And you wonder why
Nana did what she did?
Well, she did what she did
because she knew...
you couldn't handle it,
and you keep proving her right.
No, she did what she did
because you were her favorite.
No! Because I make
good decisions...
and I think about how
those decisions affect...
You know what?
All this tongue-lashing
and finger pointing...
y'all gonna stop that.
This is not gonna be
"Jump on Peaches day."
This is not gonna be
"Jump on Peaches day."
Really, huh?
Four guys in one night?
Girl, how about in one hour?
- An hour?
- She's a ho.
Man. Whoo.
Maybe we shouldn't be gossiping
about this, you know?
Somebody in the shop
might overhear us.
Ooh, gossip. Ooh!
That's something I don't do.
That's tacky. OK?
Yes. I got the information...
and if she didn't want her
business out in the street...
she would have kept
her stank behind home...
and take care of her man,
so therefore he won't...
come after me every time
I see him at the club.
So, you telling me he wants you?
Girl, he's an athlete.
What you think?
You're right about that, huh?
So, you're telling me
this is all true?
Girl, if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'.
I'm telling you my sources
are very reliable. OK?
Uh-huh.
See, Stephanie's
sister's husband...
Wait, wait, wait. But Stephanie
doesn't have a sister.
How you know?
Because I'm Stephanie, OK?
And I'd appreciate it...
if you'd stop gossiping
about me with your tacky ass!
- Tacky?!
- Tacky, OK?
You know what?
You need to respect...
because let me
tell you something!
- Respect what?
- I'm from East St. Louis, boo.
- I don't care where you from!
- I ain't got to dirty...
Dirty? You smell
dirty dirty, bitch.
- You know what? I will cut you!
- Aah!
Whoa! Calm down! Calm down!
You crazy!
- Watch your mouth!
- Whatever!
My man ain't thinkin'
about you, OK?!
Watch your mouth!
She crazy!
Talking shit.
You will wish you had...
You don't know who
you're dealing with, OK?
Oh! Hey, boo!
My man's here.
Hey, baby!
Hi, baby.
How are you? Look at my man.
You ready to go?
Quite. Honey,
do you like my hair?
I love it.
Tiffany just did it for free.
Thanks, girl.
- Let's get outta here.
- All right.
Can you believe... ooh!
I can't believe that tacky broad
pulled a knife out on me!
Ooh, she... ooh hoo!
That bitch is crazy.
Tiffany!
Tiffany,
get out here right now!
- Huh?
- Get out here right now.
From now on, If I hear
you breathe another word...
about somebody else,
you are out of here.
And that goes for everybody!
OK, look, let's just all
take a deep breath.
Now, obviously,
it's been a long day.
Why don't we all just go
someplace and chill?
- Drinks on me, OK?
- I don't want to go.
Ooh, yeah, I wanna do that!
- Angela!
- Come on, Angie.
Don't call me that.
Angie, Angie, Angie,
stop trippin'.
Gonna go with some mens
up in the place.
Come on, come on. Mmm mmm mmm!
Fine. I'll get my purse.
And you... zip! No more, OK?
Translation... shut your mouth.
Ooh hoo!
- Whoo!
- Hey!
To our clients! Clients!
You gonna get some clients.
Ooh, y'all, there are
some fine men up in here!
Up in here!
Guess who got a bun in the oven?
Ohh!
- You?
- Mm-hmm.
- You having a baby?
- Oh, this is great news.
How many months?
- Nine weeks.
- Ohh!
I loved it when
she called me Big Poppa.
Ha!
I'll believe that
when I see it, Big Poppa.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, wait a minute.
Now, that is fine. Hi.
Oh, girl, he like
the ol' Bryant Gumbel type.
Whatever.
Ooh, and his story
is speaking loud to me.
The suit 100 wool Armani?
Clocked it.
- Bruno Magli shoes?
- Mmm.
Omega Seamaster watch?
- Yes.
- Manicured hands?
And it look like he work out.
He look like he got money. Hey!
Aw, no, look,
I've had enough of this.
I'm outta here.
Ooh, he's coming over here.
Do I have lipstick in my teeth?
Teeth are cool.
Everything's...
How are my teeth?
Them's gonna get knocked out.
Excuse me.
Hey!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like to dance?
Uh... no.
Yes! She wants to dance.
She's a dancer.
- Go on and do it.
- Well, I seem to be...
If she don't want to dance,
you can come back!
Smack it up, flip it,
and rub it down.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
I didn't get your name.
Angelle Whitaker.
Oh, Angelle.
You sure look like an angel.
Well, thanks.
Good decision, young man.
She's much too uncouth
for someone of your potential.
Miss Mona.
Can I buy you a drink?
Hypnotiq, please.
You look fly as shit. Damn!
And here I thought
I looked pretty good.
That's what I meant.
Profanity, my dear,
is the sign...
of an ignorant mind
trying to express itself.
Say what you mean
and mean what you say.
Damn. Well,
if that's the case...
why don't we put these drinks
on pause and have a dance...
before I say something
else that messes us up?
You know, I hate to cut
this night short...
but I got a big merger closing
on Monday and I gotta go.
Oh. L... I understand.
But I will most definitely
be calling you.
- OK.
- Bye!
Mmm!
I think I'm in love. Ohh!
Girl, that ain't love.
You just ain't had none
in a while.
Stop.
I think he looked fine.
Yeah, he's a good one.
Thank you, Jun Ni.
Me too.
All right, Angie!
To the stage, a lovely woman...
an exotic woman...
Simone!
{y:i}Ooh
{y:i}Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All right, girl, bring it in!
{y:i}I used to walk around
{y:i}with my head held low
{y:i}'Cause no one
{y:i}understood my vibe
{y:i}They couldn't
{y:i}comprehend my flow
{y:i}Then this beautiful man
{y:i}Appeared in the middle
{y:i}of the night
{y:i}Told me to sleep tight
{y:i}Everything's gonna be
{y:i}all right
{y:i}Said, sister,

{y:i}He digs my mind, he likes
{y:i}my spirit, he loves my soul
{y:i}My heart opened up,
{y:i}I let him take control
{y:i}Now I got so much love
{y:i}So much love for him
{y:i}So much love
{y:i}So much love for him
{y:i}So much love
{y:i}So much love for him
{y:i}No one can come between
{y:i}my man and me, no way
{y:i}No one can come between
{y:i}my man and me, no way
No way
Ha ha! Hey!
Whoo!
Yeah! Let's go! Yeah! Yeah!
Dang, I didn't know
you guys would be here!
We didn't know you can sing!
Girl, you need a manager
'cause I need a side gig.
This is Angelle.
This is
the Beverly Hills Police.
There's been a break-in
at your shop.
What?! I'll be right there.
Peaches, meet me at the salon!
- OK.
- What's that about?
I don't know.
Yeah, this is 62 Henry.
We have no known possible
suspects at the scene.
- What the...
- Oh, no!
- This is bad!
- Come on, baby.
Are you all right?
No.
What has happen here?
Angie?
Hey, hey, I...
Look at me.
This is nothin', baby.
We're gonna get through this,
you hear me?
- Pull it together.
- OK.
We will fix this.
We are Whitaker girls.
Nana's girls.
Yeah. OK.
Like I said, we'll have
a complete police report...
in a couple of days.
Well, thank you, Officer Bates.
Don't thank me.
Thank your neighbor...
Miss Marcella Hunter.
Marcella?
Ohh!
Man...
Damn. Now where am I gonna go?
Marcella!
Right this way.
Fiona, you may want
to leave, baby.
Oh, Angela.
So glad you could stop by.
Ahem.
- Oh, no, she didn't!
- You must be out your mind.
Kick her ass, Angela.
Peaches!
You destroyed my shop.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
- Kick her ass!
- I did my civic duty.
I heard a ruckus.
I called for help.
Civic duty? And you think
you're gonna get away with this?
Get away with what?
I'll kick her ass.
Don't even...
Hold up!
- Oh, that's disappointing.
- Oh, is it?
You really can't take the ghetto
out of the girl, can you?
Ghetto?
Did she just say ghetto?
That's what she said.
Oh, no, I'll show you ghetto...
No! No! Uh-uh, Angie!
Don't waste your shoes
on this trick.
Now, I got a better idea.
Why don't we just take the shop?
Then we whip up on that ass.
You know what?
I'm gonna fight you for it.
Ladies, I don't want to fight.
I just want the shop.
I'm talking about
the hair battle.
If you beat us, I sell.
If not, you sell to us.
Well, that's a nice try,
but the deadline was today.
Oh, well, I've already entered.
See, I figured you were
gonna change your mind.
Ooh, yes.
Now it's on you.
Either you take this beatdown
or winner takes all.
Winner takes all.
Uh, Marcella,
let me introduce myself again.
I'm Peaches. I ain't Angelle.
Say that fool stuff again,
know that your ass is whupped.
You really need
to know who I am.
- Next time, I'ma let her loose.
- Get out of my shop.
You better know me, baby!
They writin' books about me!
Close that door.
I'm calling the police!
Call the police!
Give me a reason!
Give them a reason
to lock me up... ooh!
Heave!
Do it right.
And heave... ho!
Heave! Oh,
you better not do that.
You might break a nail.
Gotta get in the cracks.
Right. Come on, now.
You gotta get it wet.
- It's a man thing, baby.
- Right. That's real manly.
See that?
I can do it without looking.
Ooh! You're a bad boy.
Gianni, that hairstyle's
from 1962...
when Gladys Knight
was still with the Pips.
A mess. Simone!
Madam C.J. Walker invented
the straightening comb.
Use it!
- Tiffany!
- Ooh!
The grand prize
is $50,000, not 5.
That's a $5.00
basement hairstyle.
Rework it.
Jun Ni, keep doing feet.
- That's whack.
- Mr. Drake.
If you stop being a playboy and
start being a hair stylist...
you wouldn't have
this creation of a mess.
Hee hee hee!
Angelle...
you rock that.
Thanks, sis.
Do it again.
Hey, this one I got old shoe.
You want to try this one?
Ooh, girl, no. Get out of here.
- But...
Get out!
Don't hit... OK, you crazy.
Like you gonna hit me
or something.
I'm not gonna hit you.
You don't mind
a little wine, do you?
Mm-mm.
Tell you I'm a chef?
- Are you really?
- No.
- Ha ha ha!
- I hope you like it.
I'm gonna be very honest.
Oh, you want to play?
I ain't started
playing yet, Peaches.
Mmm.
Mmm!
- Is that all right?
- Mmm!
Mmm!
Ha ha ha ha.
Mr. Cliff...
You're real sweet.
Thank you. Thank you.
Keep it real.
I want to dance with you.
Is that real enough?
That's... that's real real.
Real dangerous, Mr. Cliff.
Ooh!
Yeah, baby!
Whooo!
Yeah!
- Yes!
- Yes! We got this.
Hey, you.
Good night, you guys.
- Good night.
- Good night, Angelle.
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm!
Mmm.
Ohh...
Oh, my God!
- What?
- Oh!
Who's that?
What just happened here?
Who was that?
It's open!
I don't know whatever happened
to "Who is it?" but...
Hey, what's up, Angelle?
Is Peaches around?
No, she's not, but, um...
come on in. Have a seat.
Ahem.
Wine?
No, no, I'm good on the wine.
You expect her back
anytime soon?
You look nice.
Thank you. You look...
like you been drinking.
Damn! Girl, you been
throwin' them back.
What's going on, Angelle?
I was really thinking
of something.
Um, when Peaches and I
were younger...
our grandmother decided
that we could have a pet.
I... wanted this...
yellow crested parakeet.
And, Peaches,
she wanted a puppy.
The problem was, even back then
we couldn't agree on much.
OK.
I mean, like, for days we were
yelling and not speaking.
Drove Nana crazy.
OK, and then what happened?
What happened after that?
Ha ha ha. I got a dog.
Damn.
I wanted that parakeet.
Uh, you know something,
Angelle?
It's all good right here,
but I can't even trip.
You know what I mean?
And you're feelin' on my leg...
Well, it's right there.
I know, so why don't you
just kind of get ov...
Hey, Peaches.
Uh, you know something?
L... I was just talking
to your sister.
Uh, could you please excuse us?
Listen, Peaches,
this isn't even what...
Huh.
I'll talk to you later.
Peaches, I'm...
Uh-uh!
I can't believe you.
Cliff?
You know what, Angela?
Do me a favor.
Don't take the knife
out of my back too fast.
I might just bleed to death.
Peaches, you can't run away
every time there's a problem.
Oh, no? Watch.
Nana was right. You are afraid.
Nana? Nana?!
Nana didn't give
a damn about me!
Because if she had, she wouldn't
have left you everything!
But you know what?
This ain't even about money.
It's about trust and betrayal.
And you are the one person...
I should have been able
to depend on!
I did not betray your trust!
Peaches...
Don't be mad at Cliff, OK?
This was all my fault.
I was drinking.
My night's not...
Come on, now.
We used to be best friends.
What happened?
We grew up.
So what about the hair show?
A-ha! Ohh, you're nervous.
Afraid you might lose your shop?
I was, um...
saving this for when we won.
- Keep it.
- Please.
I'll be back to get my stuff.
I'm sorry, Nana.
Wow. This is a lot
of food, baby.
It's all your favorite.
Yeah, I see.
Sit, sit.
Jun Ni...
you know you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.
No, I want to.
Yes. You went through
all this trouble...
I got to eat it, right?
- Yes. Start with the chicken.
- The chicken?
OK.
Can we pray first?
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.
Uh, Lord...
bless this food.
All the food.
And I hope you bless the hands
that prepared this food...
and bless the stomach
that this food is gonna go into.
- Amen.
- Amen.
And I start with the chicken?
Yeah.
It's right there on top.
You like?
This is good, Jun Ni.
You made this?
You really like it?
You really like it?
Yeah, this is good, baby.
Mmm! Yes!
Here. Some macaroni and cheese.
Mmm!
Mmm, this is good, Jun Ni.
Black-eyed peas. Mmm. Mmm!
Mmm!
And some corn from here.
Ooh, some corn.
Give me that corn.
Oh, that's so juicy.
Mmm! Oh, Jun Ni!
Mmm! Jun Ni!
This food is turning me on.
Mmm!
{y:i}Yeah
{y:i}It's time to separate
{y:i}the weak from the strong
{y:i}Yeah

Oh, man! This is crazy!
I know! Love it!
I think we're over here.
Exactly what are
they selling?
I don't know,
but I'd buy some of it.
You're a whore.
You'll buy anything, slut.
{y:i}I'm so exclusive
{y:i}Getting out the beat,
{y:i}I'm so elusive
{y:i}And who dare
{y:i}challenge daddy?
{y:i}After the show,
{y:i}I'm countin' hundred stacks
{y:i}With my feet propped up,
{y:i}why compete
{y:i}If you ain't tryin' to have
{y:i}this whole game locked up?
Whoa!
OK, uh, where's the box of hair?
- It's over here.
- OK.
Uh, Gianni, I need you
to start laying out...
the first hairstyle with me.
- Hold this.
- You see an outlet?
That would be back there.
Jun Ni, I need
the blond hair, please.
We left at shop.
Oh, great.
- Tiffany!
- Tiffany!
Huh?
Sweetie, I need you
to go back to the salon...
and get the blond hair.
Oh, who forgot
the blond hair?
- You did!
- Oh.
OK, please make it snappy.
- Keys, please.
- Hurry up.
Just ten minutes to
the Wash and Wear competition.
Hurry, Tiffany!
Quickly! Quickly, people!
Let's unpack those boxes.
Come on,
I want them right there!
I want you to plug in
those irons. I want...
Fiona! Where's my coffee?
All right, I want my sign.
Where's my sign? Where...
I want that sign,
I want it over there...
I want you to raise it up.
I want you to raise it up.
I want to see my name up high.
The winning name should
be up high. High!
Hi. Winning name up high.
Thank you! Let's go!
Come on, we got a show to win.
This is my show.
This is my show. Yes!
Ladies and gentlemen...
put your hands together
for your host Dark Gable!
It's about you, baby!
It's about you!
Get busy! Yeah!
Don't hurt her, girl.
I know it's all about you, baby.
Don't worry about nothin'.
Don't hurt nobody!
This is Hair... Hair Battle...
Hair Battle...
Hair Battle Royale!
Whoo whoo whoo!
Whoo!
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the Hair Battle Royale!
Sponsored by Revlon...
professional, realistic.
I am your host, Dark Gable!
I need more shine.
Where is the spray?
More spray.
And I want to get a little more
volume, so I need some clips.
OK, I'll get the clips.
Oh! Unh.
Baby...
Oh, I can't do this.
Calm down, Angelle.
You do good.
Angelle!
Oh, gee, you look tense.
Ha ha ha!
That child ain't right.
Ohh, Simone,
your style is fantastic.
- Thank you.
- Real nice.
Cliff, I...
I just want to say
I'm... I'm sorry.
Don't even worry about it.
It's all right.
- Don't sweat, all right?
- OK.
Hey, guys, why don't you
give me a nice little smile?
Say "Angelle's" on three.
One, two, three.
- Angelle's!
- Angelle's!
Up first, ladies and gentlemen,
is our natural styles.
Welcome to
the Hair Battle Royale...
where we came to shut it out!
Yo, we gotta go. It's time.
OK. All right.
Jessica, go do your thing.
Go, girl.
She looks great.
Ooh. Lord, do your thing.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I feel a little bit of
rumble-bumble backstage.
And they better bring it on!
Haah!
Natural styles are something
everybody wants to wear now.
She has burgundy colors
and brown colors.
She's working this feather...
to accent her dress
and her eyelashes.
Up next on this runway
are two fierce divas...
her hair was made out of yarn...
and she's working with blue,
burgundy and brown.
Ladies and gentlemen...
you're looking at
our wonderful flowers and knots.
At the base of her knots...
they all have prepared
little flowers...
braided at the base.
All right, work it!
The queen of the Nile,
she decided to show up today.
Her hair is very long...
but they've taken it up
and made a natural palm tree.
Ladies and gentlemen,
there you have it...
the afro kiss,
the flowers with knots...
the cultural mix,
and the natural palm tree.
Peaches! You getting your stuff
so you can come to the show?
What you doing?
No... the question is,
what are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be
at the hair battle?
Yeah, but we forgot
the blond weave.
You coming, right?
Oh, Peaches...
- Look, Tiffany...
- Peaches...
Peaches!
Now, look, I don't know
if you know this or not...
but Angelle is a brand-new
person since you been here.
I've never seen that woman
smile so much.
She has a life now,
and I know it's because of you.
Huh. Your grandmother must be
turning in her grave.
Her hanging out with us,
going to the bar...
chillin',
lettin' her hair down...
that would've never happened
if you were not here.
You have made such
a difference in her life.
In all of our lives, really.
Peaches, she needs you.
And from the look on your face,
you need her, too.
So... I hope you, um...
take what I just said
into consideration...
before you do anything hasty.
Good luck.
Thanks.
I hope you change your mind.
Just in case
you don't know it...
Angelle really loves you
and she cares... a lot.
It's been a long night,
and pimpin' ain't easy.
We're down
to twelve salons, folks.
Let's see what they've got
in our color competition.
Hair affair...
if you're not bringin' it...
you better leave it alone.
Ha ha!
It's called...
"If I lose this competition...
"you'll never work
in this town again."
Never.
This is fabulous.
Skittles...
taste the rainbow.
Ha ha ha!
Ow! I been working
this thing for you!
She's walking like a little
polka dot Barbie doll.
She's working
this white platinum hair...
with red polka dots
all over the top.
Wanna be you at your finest?
Well, it must be this afro.
Black and white afro.
She's not playing with
all those multicolors in it.
I hope you caught
those Skittles in her eyes.
Ladies and gentlemen,
make some noise!
Pow! I hope you don't
go home with the blues.
See? And I tell you
she's not playing.
Turquoise and all that, ow!
You better go, you rock star!
Blond in the front,
fuchsia in the middle...
and purple in the back!
Ladies and gentlemen,
make some noise!
Let's see those cats walk!
Mohawk!
Polka dotted all around...
and we're workin'
this afro right now.
She's... oww!
So cute. Little girl fly.
Now, guess what?
It's time to say good-bye...
to all our little lovelies.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, Nana.
"Happy is the man
that findeth wisdom...
"and the man that
getteth understanding.
"My dearest Peaches...
"if you are reading this...
"then I know you've grown
into a beautiful woman.
"Know that, in the end...
"all you have is each other.
"I love you. Nana."
I love you, too, Nana.
I'm on my way, Angie.
Ladies, it's been a long night.
I know you're tired
and ready to go home...
But guess what? We're down to
our final six salons.
Our final six are...
Headhunters!
Next of the six... Hair Affair!
Now, you know they was
fighting in the back...
but I'm not mad at 'em.
The next of the final six
is Dreamweavers!
Oh, yeah!
They always said
they were gonna work it...
but guess what? They're
the next... Crown and Glory!
Hold on! Hold on!
Up next, the fifth team is...
Styles of Life!
And the last team to move up
to the fantasy island round...
is none other but Angelle's!

Whoo! Yes!
You know you're lookin' good!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoo! Fantasy Island!
Something

I'm so glad you're here.
All right, child, let's do this.
We gotta win this.
That's awesome.
Just want to say that...
I'm sorry.
It was not the way it looked,
believe it or not.
Cliff, there's no need
to apologize.
OK.
We were friends
and we still are friends, OK?
I mean, let's be honest.
You wanted the skinny one
from the beginning anyway.
I was just a nice sexy fly...

Wait a minute!
I know she not lookin'
at herself in the sea shell.
I'm lookin' at pink hair...

I'm lookin' at
a multicolored mermaid.
