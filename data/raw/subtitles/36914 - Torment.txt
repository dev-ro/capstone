TORMENT
GRAMMAR SCHOOL
You there! Stop!
What offence has this miserable
young man committed?
He was late for morning prayers.
So was I.
I don't know my Latin,
bet I get caught.
I had misgivings earlier.
- Where are they now?
- In my stomach. The runs I have!
Isn't my soprano voice pretty?
Shut up, I'm revising!
Stop bothering me!
Volo, nolo, malo, cupio, juvio...
Look at Caligula,
our favourite tormentor.
Planning his next torture.
- That'll be fun.
- "Fun"? Sublime, I'd say.
I was really down when my bird
told me she's expecting.
Bugger me!
I wasn't planning to be a family man.
Not yet.
- No hymn book?
- Stolen.
Don't lie. Go to the side.
- Black mark, do you think?
- Trust me to get caught...
I'll show no mercy.
If you don't pay attention, I won't.
I have no objection
if you want to make it unpleasant.
Please continue, Mr Petterson.
"After Fabius Maximus
had thus decamped...
"...the army marched on
for ten days...
"...whereupon it pitched a camp
by the lgas River.
"The seconds-in-command
were called to the consul's tent...
"...where he told them...
"...where he told them that...
"...that, whereas it would not
be impossible...
"...the strategy would...
"...that they, however..."
I can't make this sentence out, sir.
Then may I trouble you
for the next one?
"To the legates, this seemed..."
"...and later, privately,
amongst themselves..."
You haven't had time to open
your books, Mr Petterson.
At least not in the right place...
But I'll be lenient,
and give you a chance to reflect.
Please continue, Mr Widgren.
"To the legates, this seemed
a good statement."
- Is this what it says? Karling!
- "Proposal."
Continue!
"A good proposal.
"Whereupon they agreed...
"...a large gift would be given to..."
Don't you know your own language?
We don't say "give a gift".
That's bad Swedish.
What do we say, Mr Widgren?
Aren't we quick-witted today...?
- Ström?
- "Present a gift."
Does that sound familiar, Mr Widgren?
Yes, of course.
Of course... Continue!
"They stepped before the consul
and assured him they were ready."
Thank you. That will be all.
"Afford a person pleasure." Widgren!
Afficere aliquem laetitia.
- "Inspire a person with fear."
- In... aliquem timore.
"Inspire."
- In...
- Well?
- Inicere.
- Someone whispered.
Genitive with impersonal verbs.
Examples, Kreutz?
Miseret, paenitet, piget,
pudet, taedet.
- "Pardon". Karlsson?
- Parco, peperci, parsum, parcere.
"Beat". Bokstedt?
Plango... plantice.
- Wrong! Bergström?
- Plango, planxi, planctum, plangere
Caesar hostem aggressus devicit.
- Widgren?
- "Caesar defeated the enemy."
- Example of what?
- Participial construction.
- Which one?
- Participium coniunctum.
- Predicative attribute.
- Of what?
Haven't you prepared for the lesson?
I have, sir.
I believe you're lying, Mr Widgren.
I'm not, sir.
No...?
No.
Is that so?
Which verbs are in the genitive?
Verbs that mean remind, remember,
forget, accuse, convince, judge,
acquit, all transaction verbs.
- Example?
- Aestimo.
- Is that so?
- Facio, duco, puto.
- Really?
- Cano.
Mercor.
Dono.
Still claim you know your lesson?
I knew it yesterday.
You're lazy, and pay no attention
to me or my lessons.
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?
Open your book!
Begin with today's exercise.
Quick! Quick!
"The battle raged three days.
"Eventually the Romans
routed Hannibal's forces.
"A great number were taken prisoner
and brought before the consul.
What is this? Using prohibited aids,
Mr Widgren?
I forgot to erase it.
"Forgot to erase it"...
But of course...
Forgot to erase it...
Cheating, sir! Cheating!
Unfortunate, having to punish a pupil
only two months before finals.
A fortnight before the mock exams.
Most unfortunate.
Most.
I'll speak to the Headmaster.
I believe we'll see quite a bit of
one another, Mr Jan-Erik Widgren.
Good afternoon!
- He should be shot!
- Bastard!
Sadist!
I can't wait to be rid
of this misery.
Boy, am I going to sleep then!
Sleep and eat and forget
all about this place.
Let's get some tobacco.
- Hello, my dear Carmen!
- Hello. What do you want? A toffee?
You know I can't sell tobacco
to schoolboys.
- Bye then!
- Bye-bye, sweetheart!
- It's for my dad.
- Come again?
Stop it!
Let's go, Sandman.
I'll have this magazine, miss.
Thank you. Good day.
A pack of Havanas and a Hudson.
Please, could you open it for me,
I'm so clumsy.
Have you cut yourself?
It's nothing.
Nothing at all.
- Anything else, sir?
- No, thanks.
Charge my account, as usual.
Good day.
You look off, Jan-Erik.
Bror, dear, you know
you mustn't tilt your chair.
Jan still looks off.
Mind your own business!
- He's only trying to be kind.
- Kids should shut up while eating.
- How was school today?
- All right, I guess.
Is that the truth?
No.
Is it something unpleasant?
You answer it, Bror.
- Tell me what happened.
- I got a black mark.
For cheating.
- How do you know?
- Your Latin master rang.
- Your teacher seems justified.
- Really...
- How could you cause us such pain?
- I didn't cheat.
It was illegible.
I wrote it during prep
and forgot to erase it.
It's most unfortunate,
especially now,
just before your finals.
- It's not that bad.
- That's a matter of opinion.
You seem to take it lightly.
Your mother and I are very sad.
In my opinion you have sullied
your reputation.
Shall we leave the table?
It's not as if I'm a criminal, is it?
Don't mind Dad.
You know what he's like.
Sandman's on the phone.
He wants to go to the pictures.
I'm whacked!
Wouldn't it be great to have a bed
like the one in the film.
And a nice bird.
- You think?
- You bet!
A table filled with grub and booze,
that bed and a bird...
I wouldn't get up for two weeks,
I'd just eat and sleep
and have it off with the bird.
You're a genuine materialist.
I see things differently.
I'm going to write and
play the violin all the time,
once I'm out of that hellish place.
As for women and the rest...
I'll only have one.
And I'll love her.
You don't have one now, do you?
What about Lena?
- I'm not in love with her.
- In love?
You're nuts! I suppose you want one
that's pure and innocent...
- Yes.
- That kind don't exist.
Really?
All women are tramps.
And if they're not, they want to be.
Nietzsche and Strindberg say so.
Can we have the bill, please?
- Coming in?
- I've got to study blasted Latin.
That Caligula is a bastard.
I don't know... He's odd
more than anything.
When you turn up a stone,
you find nasty animals underneath...
You see, Caligula isn't
a genuine swine.
He's a nasty little venomous creep.
I don't believe a person
can be all evil.
You're still an adolescent.
Wait, you'll see how rotten
everything is. It's truly ingenious.
Goodnight.
- You must think me silly.
- Nonsense!
You're the only one I can talk to.
You can't help being an idealist,
believing in innocent women.
- Goodnight.
- See you.
- Are you all right?
- Never felt better in my life.
- Miss Olsson! Can I help you?
- Oh, shut up!
What are you staring at?
Bothering a lady like this.
- Don't be silly, you need help!
- Silly, eh...?
Come closer, I'll give you...
- Stop babbling. Where do you live?
- Let me go!
- Stop shouting. Where do you live?
- None of your business.
Try to act sober,
there's a policeman up there.
So where do you live?
...number 32, fourth floor.
Leave my brandy alone!
- Leave me alone.
- I'm going.
- Goodbye.
- No, don't go!
I'm scared of being alone.
He might come.
I'm so terribly afraid of him.
- Please, don't go! Please!
- Who are you afraid of?
I can't tell you.
He knows everything...
He spies on me.
And when he's here...
Please, stay.
I can't stand it any longer!
I can't stand it.
I know it...
He'll be the death of me.
Tormenting me...
- Stay with me. Please...
- I can't.
You can't? Why?
- My parents will be mad.
- Mad?
- I suppose you have homework.
- Yes, I do.
Then go!
Still here?
What's it going to be?
I'd like to stay...
But...?
I don't fancy you.
Does it matter?
It does to me.
Do I disgust you?
Do I frighten you?
Yes... a bit.
Don't be frightened.
- Are you leaving?
- I have to. It's half past three.
Come say goodbye.
- It was kind of you to stay.
- Sure, very kind.
Come back and see me often.
We'll see.
Promise... You must promise.
All right, I promise.
Promise Pelle, too.
Yes, Pelle, I'll come back.
Promise...
Goodnight.
- Has anyone seen Petterson?
- He's still in the classroom, sir.
There you are, Petterson.
I need to talk to you.
- I know.
- Come here.
Petterson, Petterson...
It's not easy to be form master
when a thing like this happens.
Why did you play truant, Petterson?
What possessed you?
Were you afraid of someone?
Hadn't you prepared for the lesson?
We really have to talk about it.
Don't you see that?
Well?
You see, Caligula...
- I mean, the Latin master...
- Yes, I understand.
- He scares you.
- Scares you?
Your mind goes blank,
you're struck dumb.
The others hate him.
We're all scared.
Most teachers you respect.
But he enjoys frightening us.
He's sadistic.
- Do you think so, Petterson?
- I don't know.
So you played truant on Monday
because it was double Latin.
All your Sundays are ruined
because of the Monday Latin lessons.
And now you get
a black mark, Petterson.
Was it worth it?
Yes.
Are you that frightened?
Please don't give me a black mark!
It will spoil my oral.
Please - I won't do it again.
My parents will be so cross.
I won't dare go home.
I'm too indulgent.
Good job I'm retiring next year.
I can't be loyal to both
the pupils and the teachers.
But you just watch it, Petterson.
Don't repeat it!
I think the boys are afraid of you.
It won't do them any harm.
You can't teach the pupils anything
that way.
No?
Why not try to be a bit nicer?
They're not bad.
Lazy, yes.
But they're good boys, really.
At least I think so.
You know... our work is complicated.
Wouldn't it be best
to meet them halfway?
We shouldn't be enemies,
we and the boys.
The job is nerve-racking enough
as it is.
You mean I terrorise them?
What are you trying to say?
That a man of your learning
shouldn't care so much
for respect bred from fear.
- That's no concern of yours.
- It is!
It's my class, and my boys.
- So they're harmed, are they?
- Yes. Not all, but some.
The others just despise you.
And laugh at you
when your back's turned...
- How do you know?
- I know my boys.
- And I don't?
- No, you don't.
If you did, you'd behave differently.
Behave?
Please do not use that word.
This is not a matter of words.
I thought you cared for your boys.
But I'm just an old fool.
I can see now that you don't care
one jot for them.
Really?
Do you care for them?
A teacher must care for his boys.
If he doesn't, then
what does he care about in life?
I don't wish to be cross-examined!
Who has taken map Number 40?
But I wish to make it clear to you
that you are unsuited
to be a teacher!
Maybe I am too, because I'm too kind.
But I like my boys
- and I'm not afraid of them!
Are you saying I'm afraid? Nonsense!
For you it's a fight to the death.
"Frighten me,
and I'll scare you to death!"
I'll tell you that's wrong,
as you can't see it for yourself.
- Where is map Number 40?
- Stand still, and calm yourself.
Just listen to me.
I'm old enough to be your father.
Our profession is a vocation.
It means to have a calling,
something that comes naturally.
Your academic qualifications
and years of service alone
don't make you a teacher.
You don't know
the first thing about boys!
You don't put your heart
into your work.
A bit of kindness and understanding.
But you don't have enough of these
to feed a flea!
If you were unique,
it wouldn't be so bad.
You can be found in all schools.
Not only schools, but everywhere!
A tormentor of human beings,
that's what you are!
Listen to me...
I have been ill... very ill.
My nerves are still
not quite recovered.
The curriculum is demanding and hard.
I'm impartial.
I don't cosset or indulge.
I work objectively.
I will not change because
you have stumbled
on some nervous imbecile
who has complained!
Where is that map?
Oh, sorry, I have it. Good day!
- Is Widgren here?
- No.
- Where is he?
- He's fetching the notebooks.
There you are.
- Do you want me, sir?
- I want to speak to you.
Let's sit down over there.
Widgren... It's a shame
there's bad blood between us.
A great shame... very great.
I don't want you to dislike me.
You see...
I've had a difficult time.
And I've been ill.
Very ill.
I've been watching you, Widgren.
You view me with aversion,
almost animosity. Please don't.
I don't know what to say.
I've nothing against you, sir.
Yes, you have.
You must stop seeing me like that.
I forbid you!
That will be all, Widgren.
What did our favourite sadist want?
He's The Devil himself!
Who's the girl you were seen with
in the street last week?
- Oh, just a friend.
- I see, a girlfriend.
You play beautifully.
You're so clever!
That was nothing.
I've no time to practise these days.
The adolescent's morning dream...
To sit in his girl's room,
eating biscuits.
- You can laugh.
- I'm so happy right now.
I don't care what happens.
The twilight's beautiful.
Why don't we go for a walk?
Laugh at Caligula
and all the other teachers!
I don't know...
Tell me...
Do you like me just a little?
You see, I...
Do you see that star?
It seems to be hanging far below
the sky on an invisible string.
It's been great company to me.
If only you knew how lonely I was.
Lonely...
Who hasn't been lonely?
I used to stand at the crossing,
watching the trains.
Please don't laugh.
I used to think
that one day I'd be on one.
A sweet young woman...
in a bell-shaped skirt
and a funny hat, no luggage.
Now you'd be there, too.
Would you want to come?
Nothing would frighten us any more.
You were so afraid before.
Yes, I was.
Won't you tell me who he was?
No, I can't. I just can't!
He's tried to get in.
I've heard him fumbling with his key
in the new lock.
He's phoned too.
Sometimes I've felt him
following me in the street.
Let's not talk about that now.
Let's have some tea.
My friend Sandman is a cynic
and hates women. He's terribly sharp.
He thinks I'm adolescent.
Do you think so too?
Not at all.
I've never felt so good as with you.
Bertha... Have there been many
before me?
No, but you see...
It was fun having them chase me.
- Have you never been really in love?
- No.
- Why not?
- Don't be stupid!
No one ever wanted me.
I wanted to live a little.
And I thought that...
Oh, never mind what.
I was wrong, anyway.
I don't believe you.
You're lying!
You're only trying to scare me!
He's a beast!
A beast!
Bertha! Who is he?
You mustn't leave me.
Do you hear me, my darling!
Don't just sit there. Hold me...
Don't let him come here.
I'm so afraid.
What are you afraid of?
Does he hurt you?
It's not just that...
Don't turn the light on.
Jan-Erik!
Stay with me, please...
Don't be afraid. There are no ghosts.
I've seen at least one.
That's dead and buried as of tonight.
I'd like to believe it.
Listen... I have something for you.
It's a key to my door.
You can come and go as you please.
- Thanks, but what about my exams?
- I'm sure you'll do well.
- I haven't done any work.
- I'll keep my fingers crossed.
I wonder which topics will come up?
Damn!
FIRST DAY OF EXAMS
Now we'll pay
for our years of neglect.
We should be dressed up.
- You're an old hand.
- Second time round. I'm no amateur.
There should be a drum roll.
And we could all sing:
"Fear not, little flock."
Ssh! The Head.
- Hot, isn't it?
- Yes, it's very hot.
Look at them
in their funeral clothes...
Do you know why they all dress up
to look like undertakers?
They're shaky, you see.
Today is their big day.
They get puffed up with importance
by the exams.
They never get any further
than the diploma.
They don't get any bigger,
it's their climax.
It's a big occasion - for them.
Gentlemen, please take
your respective seats.
Could Bergman and Ström
please come forward.
Please check the unbroken seal.
Thank you. Please be seated.
Would Senior Master kindly
distribute the papers
when I say so?
Please begin.
What's the matter?
You're drunk!
What's happened?
Answer me!
Who's been here?
For God's sake, answer me!
Bertha... tell me.
You must tell me what's happened.
You can't just stand there
looking like that.
Do you hear me?
You know I'm very fond of you,
don't you?
You've been so kind to me.
We've been so good together.
Is it all over now?
No fun being decent, was it?
Answer me!
Is it over?
- Is it?
- Yes.
It's all over.
He'll kill me.
He sits there playing
with his penknife.
Speaking softly.
He tells me such horrible things.
Filthy, horrible things!
Suddenly, he'll get nervous
and start pacing the room.
He has such horrid white hands,
with hairy fingers.
Stop talking about the creep!
I don't want to know who he is.
A moment ago, you wanted to.
How did I get into this?
I want to be left alone!
Christ, I'm so fed up with it!
With me too?
I don't know...
It's as if I'd never known you.
And you just broke up.
Just as well - I wouldn't want
to share you.
One week to the finals.
I wish it were all over!
Only a week? It's crazy!
I've heard the examiners
are a mean lot.
I can't think in this heat.
The head swells
so you can't get your cap on.
All sense evaporates!
It's all crap! Miserable,
pointless, ridiculous crap!
- The Devil's coming!
- He looks odd.
- He always looks odd.
- You'll whisper, won't you?
All present? Shut the windows!
Widgren will begin
today's translation.
I'm not prepared.
Have you gone mad?
I didn't have the time.
I was too tired.
I was doing history half the night.
Is that so?
So, you were too tired?
I see.
Mr Widgren was too tired.
- A peculiar explanation.
- I study all I can.
- You pay no attention in my classes.
- That's not true!
Really?
Anyone else who was too tired
to prepare for today's lesson?
No? In that case maybe we'll manage
to put on our jackets.
Mr Widgren seems
particularly delicate.
- Why is that?
- I don't know. I do my best.
You're lazy, Mr Widgren.
And a bit pathetic.
This is no place for weak boys.
We're heading for exams.
Haven't you understood that, Widgren?
No. One day you'll understand,
but it'll be too late then.
Do you know what I think?
I think you'll get poor grades
in Latin.
Very poor.
I also think that you're too frail
for the exam.
It would be a baptism of fire.
Not for you in your state.
Not at all...
Please begin, Petterson.
Can you imagine,
a rascal in the third form
put this on the floor in front of me
during class.
It hopped straight up to me,
chirping all the while.
What's so funny about that?
What's this noise?
Someone is making a noise.
It was me, sir. Sorry.
You see, I know you call me "Birdie".
It's a nice name. I know teachers
who are known by much worse.
Close that Greek textbook, Sandman.
Don't prepare for the next subject
during my class.
And don't think I'm too decrepit
to spot you.
Shame on you!
A man of doubtful reputation...
This set of essays contains
two absolute howlers.
Mr Petterson will have to
acknowledge paternity for one.
He writes as follows:
"The nomadic Laplanders never stay
in one place for very long."
Mr Sandman...
...has a darker side.
He consorts with gangsters
and loose women.
In a mixture of Maupassant
and Zola, he writes...
What's the matter, Mr Widgren?
May I go home, sir?
Of course! Aren't you well?
- Dear me, are you very ill?
- No, I just feel a bit sick.
What on earth...?
I can't understand
how he can be overworked.
He hasn't worked much lately.
School...
There are other things than school.
Aren't there, Mr Widgren?
- What do you mean, Doctor?
- Oh, nothing in particular.
As a doctor, you get to see
the unpleasant side of school life.
Thin and deformed individuals.
A taxi, please.
Lopsided and warped, scrawny
and undernourished, overworked...
Could I have a car for...
What's the address?
Number 11, Brahegatan.
For Dr Nilsson.
Sunken chests,
eyes tired from reading, anaemia,
even twisted sex lives...
I beg your pardon?
Yes - Dr Nilsson.
It's not that strange, really.
There they sit on their bottoms,
from eight in the morning
to four in the afternoon.
And after that they have homework.
Does that make any sense?
Thank you so much.
The curriculum gets
more and more demanding.
The teachers become
narrow-minded specialists.
Were the boys to learn all that's
demanded, they'd be in the asylum.
But they're not that stupid,
our young ones.
They do their best, with the help
of a bit of trickery.
That they still are
in such good trim,
I attribute to
well-developed laziness.
So you mean that
cheating and truancy are justified?
Certainly not.
But it's a crying shame
that boys should be driven to it
to avoid exhaustion.
- They should learn to behave.
- I agree.
But I doubt today's methods
will allow that.
Take good care of the boy.
Let him stay in bed for a day or two.
He looks like he's got the world's
problems on his shoulders.
Terribly hot, isn't it? Goodbye.
- Torsten, dear.
- Yes?
Please be quiet, Selma.
Mother?
Which verbs are
in the ablative absolute?
You do care for me, don't you?
I'm so afraid, dearest.
Never leave me again.
Never!
Help me!
Just help me!
I have to put you to death.
You are too weak
in the dead languages.
When you're dead
you'll feel more at home.
My poor little darling!
Mummy will help you...
I'll help you get into bed,
you can't lie on the floor.
I'll help you up.
You've guessed quite right.
I am afraid.
It's like I have
a white, burning spot in my brain.
It makes me conceive of things...
But I frighten myself most of all.
Like now...
I came here to scare you.
More brandy?
I've feared death only once.
It was a cat, actually.
Funny, really...
I've always been fond of cats.
A big cat was basking in the sun
in front of a house. I went up to it.
I talked kindly to it.
It rubbed itself against me
and purred.
I bent down and stroked its back.
Suddenly, it bit my hand.
It went berserk.
It dug all its twenty claws
into my hand.
It clung on,
sinking its teeth into my hand.
I'll never forget the panic.
I think I screamed.
Do you know what I did?
I put the cat, hand and arm
in a water barrel next to me.
Like this...
The cat clutched my arm.
It drowned,
but didn't release its grip.
A doctor had to cut it loose.
I still have the scars. Look!
Look at the state of me!
I don't want to!
That's the way to be.
Never lose your grip.
If you don't bite, I will.
According to observations,
this occurs
approximately one week later
than in the South.
- I have to speak to you!
- I suppose you can.
- Don't be angry with me.
- I am angry with you.
I want nothing to do with you.
- Hello.
- Hello, Widgren.
- How are you? You were...
- I'm well, thank you.
So you know the girl
from the tobacconist.
- Do you know her well, perhaps?
- No.
- Not at all?
- A little.
Tell me...
is she a nice girl, really?
I don't know. Why?
Not many days left before the finals.
Six, I believe.
This heat is trying.
Takes the life out of us all.
Is it going to go on like this,
I wonder?
Volo, nolo, malo...
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it, I didn't do it...
He'll report me...
Police...
- I didn't do it.
- Was it you who rang?
- I didn't do it.
- What's your name?
Please, calm yourself, sir.
I can't release you until the cause
of death has been confirmed.
This is crazy! I'm not a criminal!
Do you really think I am?
I'm not a criminal!
Calm yourself, sir. Just drink this.
It's just a formality.
Come with me, you should lie down
for a moment.
I wouldn't hurt a fly.
I'm so afraid, Inspector.
I've been ill.
You mustn't frighten me.
Calm yourself, sir. Lie down
and try to get some sleep.
I'll call you as soon as
the report comes in.
I'll take these.
Terrible self-neglect.
Don't know how one can drink oneself
to death, but that's what she did.
- Well, coupled with a weak heart...
- And malnutrition, yes.
Better call the police,
so that dissolute
schoolmaster can go home.
Will do.
You may go, sir.
Quite a relief, isn't it?
I'm so sorry
we had to do this to you.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, officer.
Can you wait outside, please?
Show Widgren in.
Well, this is a sorry business,
Widgren.
The Latin master has made a number
of serious charges against you.
I've noted them, and would like
to hear your version.
Sit down, Widgren.
One morning your Latin master
meets you with a girl, Bertha Olsson.
She worked at the tobacconist.
Knowing the girl is
of questionable reputation...
...he seeks her out to ask her
to stay away from you,
and to remonstrate
against her bad behaviour.
She laughs at him, swears at him
and behaves improperly.
She was drinking brandy.
Suddenly, she clutches her heart
and falls down dead.
Soon thereafter, before he had
recovered from the shock,
you arrive, opening the door
with your own key.
Finding the girl dead,
you accuse him of murder
and rush off.
Well, Widgren.
What do you say to this?
Do you believe this, Headmaster?
I don't believe anything. That is...
Yes, it's true...
I've been seeing a girl who may not
have had the best reputation.
This, coupled with your cheating,
would be enough to expel you.
- Do you realise that?
- Yes, and I don't care.
However, that's not
the only matter at hand.
I want to know if the rest is true.
I mean... how it happened.
So, you're not so sure?
Please answer my question.
Please refrain from
any personal reflections.
Would you repeat the question
to the person who's made the charge?
I don't want to do that. I can't.
Oh very well, I'll do it.
Can you swear to it that your charges
are in accordance with the truth?
He has asked me to put the question
to you in his presence.
Why should I lie?
It's true my statements
cannot be checked.
But why expel Widgren,
other than for educational reasons?
Can't we try to solve this,
for Widgren's sake?
"Educational reasons!"
- You killed her!
- Steady, Widgren!
You frightened her to death.
Tormented her, got her drunk
and tortured her!
- Like you torture all of us!
- I must protest!
You scared her to death!
If I'm expelled, then he should be
expelled a hundred times over!
- You old pervert!
- Pardon me...
What is it? Please, wait outside.
Please...?
Well, if you say so...
Enough now! Widgren, wait outside.
Have you taken leave of
your senses, boy?
Don't you realise
I can't help you now?
I wonder which one of you
is more guilty.
What do you mean?
We'll be forced to commit
an injustice.
It's inescapable.
Unless you'd consider
withholding your charges.
No, I'll not consider that.
Will you have it on your conscience
to ruin the boy's future?
Hurry, we're trying on
the graduation caps!
I won't be needing one.
Widgren!
Why didn't you come to us, my boy?
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Why...?
Expelled...
Like your mother says,
why didn't you tell us?
What would I have said?
I suppose your mother and I
deserve this.
We thought... Oh, never mind.
Say it, Father.
You thought you'd be proud of me.
Isn't that it?
Let's not talk any more about it.
What's done is done.
We shall have to try to get over it.
Yes, you must.
- What's this tone?
- It's always you and you!
You're offended,
you're disappointed.
You have to get over it.
What about me?
You couldn't care less!
I don't care about you.
You've never cared about me!
I'm not staying!
You won't have to be ashamed of me.
You're all talk.
You don't believe me, Father?
How could you?
Don't go. My darling boy,
you mustn't go.
You mustn't!
Everything will be all right.
Please don't go!
Everyone has passed!
Well, boys...
This time of your life
is now at an end.
You will step out
and see what life has to offer.
I hope that you will do
your old school credit.
Try to see it as it is:
A strict fosterer.
An exacting mentor.
Perhaps not always just.
Perhaps not all it should be.
But it has one thing
that I dare vouch for:
An honest and sincere desire
to mould you...
An honest and sincere desire
to mould you into good,
able and useful citizens.
It is my sincere hope
that it has succeeded
in this important task.
All that now remains
are the farewells.
We, your old taskmasters,
wish you happiness and success.
I hardly need tell you that, do I?
All the best, Bergman.
All the best, Kjellgren...
Swine!
What will you do now?
I don't know.
I feel like I'm going mad.
I need to think.
You're desperate, old boy.
Tell me about it.
No...
Bye, then.
Are you going to live here,
in Bertha's room?
Where else?
Thanks for coming.
She had a hard time.
You see, I...
I understand.
Do you really?
You know, all that Nietzsche
and Strindberg...
All that rubbish
I've said about women.
I don't believe it any longer.
You see, I've become...
Why don't you come with me?
Don't live here alone.
No... I want to be left alone.
Bye, now.
- Is that you, Widgren?
- Yes.
- Do you mind if I come in?
- No.
Could we have some light, perhaps?
I've been wanting to talk to you.
Sandman told me where you were,
so I thought I'd come by.
You didn't like school, did you?
Or rather, you didn't quite fit in.
Isn't that so?
I can understand that. Our school
system doesn't suit everybody.
What do you want?
Criticising school won't help.
I'll tell you what I want.
I want you to go home
to your parents.
They're so worried.
- Are they?
- Yes, they are.
- I'd like to help you if I can.
- No one can help me.
Not with your inner problems.
Like everyone else, you'll have
to bear that all on your own.
But there's something else
that needs sorting out,
for which I feel partly responsible.
Oh... and what's that?
You've suddenly broken away
from society.
You're running away
in sheer desperation.
However strange this may sound,
it's the fault of your old school.
I'd like to make up for it.
No, I can't reverse the expulsion.
But I promise to do all I can
to help you in other ways.
I have to try to stop you.
Bring you back amongst people.
Do you understand, dear boy?
Come and see me
at my house tomorrow.
- We'll talk more then.
- All right, but please go now.
Promise you won't do
anything foolish.
Well, here...
Here's some money.
Get a hotel room for the night.
Try to get some sleep.
Time passes...
You'll be able to look back on this
without pain.
Maybe you'll even learn from it.
You see, I believe
that there is a meaning
to everything that happens.
Even though it may seem unlikely
in our eyes.
Goodbye, my boy.
What are you doing here?
Maybe you want to go inside...
Here's the key. Take it...
The Headmaster was here.
What did he say?
We didn't talk about you.
I know he said something about me.
Widgren...
I didn't want this to happen.
Listen to me.
I've been ill.
I still am very ill.
I can't help it. You must know
I didn't do it deliberately.
I have nobody.
Four walls, roof, bookshelves,
bed, desk,
a cleaning woman,
schoolboys and waitresses!
But no one that wants me.
May I go now?
Nobody wants anything
to do with me.
They laugh at me or run away.
They're afraid of me, too.
Yet, I'm the one who's most afraid.
Turn on the light, Widgren!
You mustn't leave me alone!
Widgren!
Turn on the light! Stay with me!
