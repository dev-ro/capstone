Yourve made a politician

I wished to see my son
as the chief minister today.
Chief Minister?
You mustrve been dreaming.
Oh no. I showed your horoscope to
the astrologer today. He was amazed.
He said he had seen a horoscope
like yours, eighty years ago.
Only Lal Bahadur Shastri
had as good a horoscope.
Well? Yourre going to
be a leader, are you?
Ird have been happy if you said
lrd be a programming director...
or won an Olympics medal.
But you send me into politics!

A gutter!
Hurry up... itrs about to go. Look!

Dammit! Couldnrt they hold the

Your sonrs name appears for a second

You donrt know anything.
Just stay quiet.
You havenrtpaid me the

I will... sure will.
Or lrm not your son.
What are you doing...? What?
Whyrre you applying the henna?
Yes, lrm applying henna.
_ But lrm not a kid anymore, Ma.
Oh sure, yourre a grown up man.
No matter how much you grow,

Look at those pictures

This one looks like Tulsi,

I showed her your picture.
She said you look like Shaktiman!
Dad! Do I look like Shaktiman?

Havenrt you liked her, son?
Shers good, but somethingrs lacking.

Chavan is paying a visit here today
On behalf on Q_tv, your
favourite anchor_person Urmila
Long live the Chief Minister!
Long live the Chief Minister!
Donrt bow. This garland is meant for
Dr Ambedkarrs bust, not you.
What kind of Chief Secretary are
you? You ought to have told me!
C.M., my foot! Illiterate ass!
I typed out the whole
program for him.
Is the Minister distributing dhotis?
_ He might snatch the one you wear!
Go away.
Glory to Babasaheb Ambedkar
Minister... please shake my hand!
Irm Pawar!
They wonrt let me meet you, sir!
Irve been waiting for you!

Please, sir!
Thank you very much, sir!
Take care of the camera, Topi
Yourre getting a proper supply of
water in the village, I hope?
Therers water everywhere, ever

When were the street lights put up?
_ Lights? Itrs about a year now, sir
Hers lying!
_ Who spoke?
I spoke
When were the lights put up, dear?
_ The day before yesterday.
Because you were expected. They
arenrt even connected to electricity
This man is lying.
_ Watch your tongue, girl!
You speak nonsense before the C.M.!
Calm down... donrt get excited
What are you guys up to? The chief
of the electricity board...
comes from your area and so
are many other officials.
So what are you guys doing?
It isnrt just the Electricity Board.
Itrs that contractor...
I donrt want to listen to anything.
These folks cast their votes for me.
And I promised them street lights.
So why arenrt they working?
Dada, these people have
only cast votes.
The local contractor
has given us money.
He sent 4 million
during the elections.
He uses up the power
for his sugar_mill.
He holds 5000 votes of the minority.
_ All right
I want electricity here immediately!
Have it disconnected after 2 days
Out of my way...
- Eunuch!
Who was it? Who said rreunuch?rr
_ Who used abusive language? Who?
Long live, the Chief Minister!
This is for you. A reward
for speaking the truth
He just about escaped today!
_ Why did you talk nonsense?
Are we mad to remain silent?
_ Werll even lose the electricity...
we have at home!
Yourre going to get
beaten up someday.
What sin have I committed?
To speak the truth is no sin?
Baggu? Do we have electricity yet?
- No.
Thatrs just what I said!
And everybodyrs scolding me
The C.M.rs circus is moving away
and yourre angling for a girl!
Pan the camera
Whyrre we going to Phulgaon?
- To meet a flower
Itrs going to be fun then!
_ Only I will meet her
So why am I going with you?
_ To get beaten up!
Eunuch!

Since when have you begun to speak?
_ I speak only to those I like
Speak from where you are.
_ Who are you?
My name is Shivaji Rao,
son of Bhim Rao
I hold a diploma in
visual communication
Irm a cameraman with Q-TV.
Age: One day. I was born yesterday
when I set my eyes on you
I liked the girl who, without
any fear, told the C.M. the truth
What I dislike is that tractor
which is disturbing us
My favourite village
right now is Phulgaon
In my camera, I have
taken away your pictures
What I have lost to you
is my heart
I have realised that you are the
most beautiful girl in the world
I want to know your name.
_ I donrt tell scarecrows my name
So tell me then, please
Hey, listen...
Did you take my pictures?
_ Yes. Why ask?
It was a casual question
Wait... wait there!
rrLetrs traverse through these
high and low paths, my love...rr
rrl want to lose myself
in your lovely embracerr
rrLetrs sleep and wake up togetherrr
You canrt get in here!
Itrs a traffic signal.
Get down!
The bus doesnrt belong to you!
Why didnrt you halt at the stop?
My sweet will. Are you getting down
now or do I give you a punch?
Irve my exams at 2. Had I missed
this bus, lrd have missed my exams
You didnrt stop the bus and
yourre acting smart now?
Arenrt you getting down?
_ No, lrm not!
You bloody... get down!
Hers bleeding!
You push students like this?
Beat him up! Get him!
Halt the bus! The students
are going to beat me up!
Students have assaulted
our colleague.
This bus isnrt going any further!
Get down, everybody!
Whatrs happening here?
_ They beat a fellow_student...
werre staging a demonstration.
Out of my way... out!
Whatrs happening here?
Canrt you see the traffic jam?
Get that bus out of there.
_ Donrt you know who I am?
A driver of the ruling party. Okay?
- Fetch the camera. Quick!
Arrest the students. Only then
will the bus move.
This driver has assaulted a student.
Till he apologises, we arenrt moving
Park the bus somewhere. Werll
talk once the traffic is cleared
The bus isnrt moving!
- Listen to me!
The bus-drivers have caused
a traffic jam at Fountain.
They claim some students
assaulted them.
The students claim the opposite.
Nobodyrs listening to anybody
Itrs a free-for-all out here.
Ask the Commissioner to rush to the
spot. Or things could get worse
The ruling partyrs leaving...
follow him!
The Chief? Sir, Sakharam Shelke
was badly beaten up on duty
Blood is flowing like
water from a tap!
Itrs an affair for the unions now.
Talk to all the district units
Have transport ground to a halt
all over the state!
Will the cab move?
_ Sure will. On your head!
Will this bus go to Jaslok hospital?
- Eunuch!
Itrll go to hell!
- How much time will it take?
Therers a traffic jam.
Go home and go to bed! Go!
Eunuch!
_ Whom did you call an eunuch?
Why must you drivers
do such injustice?
My daughterrs 32.
Shers supposed to get married today
The bridegroom is waiting for her
and here she is
The auspicious timers slipping away
Theyrll go away, if we
donrt get there on time
With folded hands, I beg you
Please do not ruin
my daughterrs life
Please take that bus out from there.
_ Go away, donrt chew on my brains!
What a nuisance!
Irll be late again
Itrs time for the interview.
Irll have to commit suicide
if I donrt get this job.
Brother! I beg of you!
Get this bus out of the way.
My husbandrs had a heart_attack.
At least let the ambulance through
Else, herll die!
_ lrm helpless, lady
I can move my bus only when
the one ahead moves
God! What am I to do?
This way, sir...
- Whatrs the situation?
Irm fed of reasoning, sir.
Itrs drivers versus students
This fight is between students
and the driver of this bus
Whors the driver of this bus?
_ Me, sir
Move the bus.
_ It isnrt moving!
You drive a bus, donrt you?
Get it out of there
Let me see how you drive
Itrs no joke! This bus moves
over my dead body! Come on
Start up... herll move.
- Go ahead! Letrs see
Try it! My friends wonrt remain
silent if you drive it over me!
With my body, the whole of
Maharashtra will burn to ashes
Drive the bus! Go ahead
Where did casteism come in from?
A Muslim constable has run
a bus over a Hindu driver
We wonrt take it lying down!
Werll slit their throats
They donrt know our strength!
Stop everything! Nothing moves!
Bring life in Maharashtra to a halt!
_ Stop everything...
Connect me to the C.M. Pronto
The Commissioner wants
to talk to you
Go on
_ The situation is very bad, sir
With your permission, I could
break their legs and lock them up
Hey! Donrt go overboard
One of those drivers
belongs to my party
The others come from the community
which helped me get elected
And the students too help us
during the elections
Touch anyone of them, and we
will lose our support
We keep getting scared that
they will withdraw support...
and insignificantparties keep
threatening government with casteism
If they arenrt stopped, theyrll
turn the state into a graveyard
We must atleast use tear_gas
to disperse the mob...
Disperse them, will you?
Not them...
my government will be dispersed.
This chair I sit on...
doesnrt entirely belong to me.
Therers the party supporting me
The community is another claimant
and also those...
on whose money werre running this
party. Fourth come our workers.
Without even one of them,
this seat of power will collapse
If it does, lrm going to hit you
with the broken chair! Okay?
You must never solve such problems.
We ought to make an issue out
of them for political reasons
Let them scream their lungs out
Once theyrre through, theyrll be
tired, and forget everything
The swine!
Here goes your Queen.
_ And the King arrives!
Smash everything around
Whererre you taking the TVs?
_ One for my wife and the mistress.
Why deprive your sis_in_law?
_ I donrt have a third hand, sir
Oh get lost
Whyrre you taking pictures?
Get lost!
Donrt stare! Irll break your head
if you take my pictures!
Theyrre vandalising shops and
setting vehicles on fire, sir
Public property is all being ruined
If I had to issue shooting_orders,
lrd have done it long ago
Let the buses be set on fire.
Let a few shops be robbed
Irll put together a committee
and send them over to the spot
Take care till then
What a cheapskate for a C.M.!
He canrt take any decision
The exams must be underway.
Irve lost a year...
Sorry, lady. Hers no more.
He has left me all alone!
He has lost a lot of blood.
_ He might die
Any hospital around?
_ ltrs a kilometer away
But how do we take him?
Therers a traffic jam
Take care of the camera.
Irll carry him
How are you, Kumar?
_ Okay
In a little while more,
you couldrve lost your life
Thank this gentleman who
brought you here on time
Whatrs your name?
Listen! Champakali!
- What?
Your name is Champakali, right?
- No.
Is it Anarkali?
- Yuck!
Is it Kathakali then?
- That isnrt a name
So what is your name?
_ Why must I tell you?
How will I call out to you
unless I know your name?
You donrt need to call out to me

Irll call you a lizard unless

Go away, blind bat!
- Blind bat?

_ Whatrs so nice with a crying face?
Does I look nice when lrm crying?
- You do
Listen. You see the footage for
free. At least tell me your name
Your film has my name.
Look it up for yourself
rrManjari, why did you have
talk that nonsense?rr
In the riots that broke out,
everybody forgot the student...
who lay in a pool of blood.
Such was his condition...
that unless he received immediate
medical attention...
he would have died. Under the
circumstances, our cameraman...
Shivajirao, carried him on his
shoulders and took him to hospital
Over to the student
rrThank this gentleman who
brought you here on timerr
The credit for saving
this studentrs life...
goes entirely to our
cameraman Shivajirao
Bat!
- Where is it?
That footage on the riots you got,
every tv channel wants it
The telephones just wonrt

You are no longer a cameraman.
Yourre a senior news_reporter
Donrt you scream, okay...?

You shameless, insolent, rascal!
You take pictures of me bathing!
Give me that camera
What are you doing...?
One moment
Show me every picture you have taken
Right now!
Let me at least rewind it.
_ You take me for an easy girl?
Look at this
Move away!
This is me?
- Who else?
Why did you take such pictures?
_ You were angry the other day...
that I gotpictures of you crying.
To take beautiful pictures then...
Irve been going around with this
camera from 5 this morning
Ird have taken some more pictures.
But something pricked my leg
You heard me screaming
and everything got messed up
Whatrs that?
- A thorn
Not a thorn! A bite!
A snake bite
- Snake...?
Irm going to die!
A snake has bitten me!
In your village, when
a snake bites someone...
donrt they suck out the venom?
_ There you go again
How could you not realise
that a snake had bitten you?
You escaped because it
was not a venomous snake
What if it were venomous?
_ To see you happy...
I can do anything.
_ Anything?
No.
- I knew it
Should you ask, lrd say
I can do anything for you
If you ask if I could lay down
my life for, lrd say rrSorry...rr
rrNot life. Because I intend to
live with you all my liferr
Manjari, you spoke without

So tell me how you feel about me

What happened, Manjari?
Whyrre you running away?
Can you tell me whatrs happening?
_ Can you tell me who you are?
Irm her father.
- Father-in-law!
Not father-in-law. Father.
_ What a daughter you have!
Shers great!
Letrs shake hands on that!
Irm no Congress!
Kalu! Balu! Harya!
Come here quick!
This chap was harassing Manjari.
What are we to do with him?
I could break his limbs and
throw him in the lake
You wear short_pants
and bother our girl?
Watch it. Irm going to
be your brother_in_law.
The name is Kalluram.
_ Whatever it is, cool down
Use too much of English and
lrll throw a punch at you!
Eunuch!
_ What...? Shut up!
Sorry, my weakness...
but I wasnrt wrong, was l?
Whatrs the tension for...
Guests are like God, okay?
So park yourself there. Go on
Look, father_in_law...
_ lrm not your father_in_law
Irm in love with your daughter.
I wish to marry her
What do I lack? Irm earning man.
I can even sing and dance.
Ask Topi, if you wish.
_ Oh yes... here goes!
rrl was walking on the path...
enjoying a snackrr
rrl was romancing the girlrr
rrYou got jealous...
so what can I do?rr
I know a bit of Karate too
This Bruce Lee will now break
this coconut with his bare hands
No.
_ Oh yes. Give him a big hand!
You land me in the soup, Topi?
_ Drag the old man into it
Irll fix you!
Watch the coconut break into to
The next item! Herll stop
a moving truck with his teeth
What?
_ Not now... Hers fasting today
So kids, what do you think of
your brother_in_law?
And what do you think, grandma?
You have it made!
Who are you?
_ Do you watch tv?
I only tend to my fields.
I was the one who saved a student
in the riots that broke out recently
I saw it on tv!
- He saw it
What do you do for a living?
- I used to be a cameraman earlier
Irm now a senior news_reporter.
_ Is it a Government employ?
No. Itrs private.
- I want Government service
You canrt get a job in the
government. Yourre over_age
Stop joking. I want my son_in_law
to be in the governmentrs employ
Whatrs wrong with my job?
I get a salary of 15,000...
with all the perks.
Itrs just like a government job
I want him to be a government servant
These tv channels close down
every other day
Even if the salary is
just a thousand rupees...
I want someone
who has a government job
Only then will my daughter
be secure and happy
Go and find a job like that.
Werll discuss this later
Where do you disappear? I kept
looking for you all week_end
We went to see the lizard.
- Lizard?
Hers kidding, sir.
_ You werenrt around this morning
I went to the employment_exchange
for my wedding, sir
Employment exchange for your wedding?
_ Yes, sir
I donrt understand
_ For a husbandrs job, sir
Shall we talk business?
- Sure
Yourve got to interview
a very important man
Who?
Irve never interviewed someone, sir.
_ Whatrs the big deal?
This is your chance. Donrt let this
opportunity slip out of your hands
This is an exclusive show
for you, Shivaji
And your first guest is the C.M.
Why is your hand trembling?
_ My first interview, sir
That too, with the C.M.
Wonrt I be nervous?
The C.M. is no devil.
Hers a human being like you and me
Have a natural chat with him.
As if yourre talking to me
Show me whatrs in your bag
Hello! Today...
todayrs guest...
Our guest today...
Our guest needs no introduction
Hello, sir.
- Hello
You will take the interview?
_ Yes, sir
Whatrs your name?
_ Shivajirao
Hello! Our guest today
needs no introduction
The whole world knows him,
as do you and me
Come election time, the public
casts its vote in the hope...
that the chief minister
will solve their problems
And every time, they meet with
disappointment and betrayal
Just as what is happening
in your rule. Why, sir?
Looks like you donrt
step out of your studio
Today, every family in Maharashtra
has a color tv...
and every village a dish antenna.
There are telephone booths
in every corner.
They have the lnternet
Every man has a car for himself.
Every man wears proper shoes...
a watch, goes to amusementparks
and trendy eateries
Such is the level to which
standard of living has risen
I can safely conclude that
in the last 15 years...
there hasnrt been a single
starvation death
Farmers donrt get two square meals,
let alone a MacDonald burger
No worker moves around in cars.
He labours in the hot sun
The rich are getting richer.
And the poor are out on the streets
Our city happens to have
the worldrs largest slum, sir
People still face hardships in
crowded buses and trains
They still spend hours in long
queues, for their rations
Children still beg
at traffic signals
People will always point fingers.
Do you know?
Ever since I have taken over
as Chief Minister...
the literacy rate in the state
has risen to 64.8 per cent
Kerala and Mizoram have a
90 per cent literacy rate
Maharashtrars No. 1 in
industry and business
Even in crime, itrs the No One
_ There are just 35.8 per cent...
people, under the poverty line.
_ In Punjab, itrs 1 1.7 per cent
And an average manrs income
in the villages...
is still a measly 3 rupees per day.
Get your figures right first...
before you talk to me.
This is the World Economic
Forumrs report...
and this is the World Bankrs report.
The World Bank claims that the
loan it gave your government...
did not reach the public.
Your ministers ate it all up
So they withdrew the next
installment of loan
You donrt know, son. The World
Bank had set conditions...
that would have mortgaged
the whole state.
What were the conditions, sir?
Could you tell us in clear terms?
I donrt need to tell you.
Irll tell the people
The people are watching you
and hearing you.
So tell us why the World Bank
cancelled its installment
It isnrt so easily explained.
Itrs a 1000_page document
There are 18 sections in all.
You will get it at the secretariat
Spend 15 Rupees on it and
read it out to the people
Whatrs the next question?
_ Before you entered politics...
what was your family background?
_ Our was a very poor family
We were into farming.
_ What is your salary now?
What?
_ Your salary
After deductions, it should be
about 18,000 a month
Which means, annually,
you make 2,16,000...
so you mustnrt have made more than
2 or 2.5 million till today
But you own properties
worth 5000 million.
Where did it come from, sir?
Good God! Hers stripping the guy!
Nonsense! If you want to know
about my property,...
file a case in the court.
Irll tell the court what I possess
There are 1.4 million cases being
heard from the last 15 years anyway
Harshad Mehtars case
hasnrt yet been decided
Those involved in the bomb-blasts
have been acquitted
In a rape case, when it
was time for the verdict...
it was already five years
since the woman had died
And you ask me to file a case?
Remember this, sir?
- lrve seen it somewhere
It was your election manifesto
Yes, I remember.
I myself had itpublished.
We will establish a social order
devoid of crime...
We will strengthen
law and order in society
Women will be able to
move without any fear
Every family will be provided
electricity, water and provisions
Education will be provided.
Inflation will disappear...
and happy days will be here again
lnstead of rrhere againrr...
they published rrwill disappearrr
and I myself had it corrected
Has all this happened?
- Hasnrt it?
You speak of strengthening
law and order
But you are the one who
destroys the law
You are the one who
encourages casteism
Are you trying to provoke me
by saying things like that?
Not at all. I only wantpeople
to know the truth
Take a look
rrHave life in the state
brought to a haltrr
rrRun the bus over me and you think
my friends will remain silent?rr
rrThe whole of Maharashtra will
go up in flames with merr
A bus_driver brought the whole
city to a grinding halt
When questioned, he said he
belonged to the ruling party
Another driver threatened
communal violence
The Commissioner of
Police could do nothing...
because you wouldnrt let him act.
To protect your vote_bank...
you let the whole of Maharashtra
go up in flames
Property worth 2500 million
was razed to ashes...
owing to your silence.
Vehicles were set ablaze...
several people were injured
and killed... all because of you
You did notpermit anyone
to take any action
Because you did not want to lose
your chair. Isnrt that true?
Hers trapped!
You are making baseless allegations
to sensationalize this interview
I have proof
One of those drivers
belongs to my party
The others come from the caste
that helped me win the elections
And the students too help us
during the elections
If anyone of them is touched,
werll lose their support
Let them scream their lungs out
Theyrll soon get tired
and forget the whole thing
Let buses be set on fire.
Let shops be plundered
Irll put together a committee...
Well, sir? You value your chair
more than the public. Isnrt it?
Speak
What happened?
_ Hers giving him a bath
Speak up! The cat got your tongue?
Switch off the camera
Irll have you hacked
Butcher!
Ask him to switch it off
Stop it! Switch it off!
You sonofagun...
Canrt you hear me?
Stop this bloody farce!
Cut it, or lrll burn
everything to ashes!
Aim the camera at the control room.
So let me deal with this charlie
Hers coming here with the camera!
_ Stop it!
Put that slipper down.
This isnrt the state assembly
Why arenrt they switching it off?
_ ltrs a live telecast, you idiot!
Like the Cricket matches!
The whole nation is watching
Can they see me, too?
_ Yes. And your filthy slipper too
And this guy wants to be
member of parliament!
Welcome, sir... this way.
Show me your slipper, please
Where was the slipper from?
Kolhapur or Lucknow?
Dada, enough of the interview.
Shall we go?
The interviewrs over, isnrt it?
Jai Hind
Itrs a live telecast
and people are watching
People still havenrt got
the answers. Please sit down
A nice work of dubbing
You had someone with my voice
talk any nonsense...
to instigate the people against me
I donrt consider it necessary
to answer such questions
I have personally shot
this footage, sir
How much has the opposition
paid you for this job?
How much would you pay if
you were in the opposition?
You ask me any silly question
on satellite tv...
and expect me to answer you?
Why must l?
Itrs your duty to give answers.
800 million people have elected you
Do you know who a Chief Minister is?
Have you ever been to
the C.M.rs office?
Do you know what itrs
like to be in there?
You ought to see how many
people come calling every day
People who cry, who ask questions,
who thank me, seek my blessings
Some garland me,
some abuse me!
Do you know the things
I put up with?
Only someone who occupies
the C.M.rs chair will know
In a riot or emergency,...
I donrt get carried away and
take impulsive decisions
I get to the root of the problem
and solve it
I donrt ask silly questions.
Just what I did that day
You did nothing that day, sir.
What you could have solved...
you let it get even more complicated
for your own benefit
And you justify yourself here?
Play with fire
and you will burn
You donrt understand!
You will know,
when you play with fire
For a day, just one day,...
become the C.M.
You will know where it hurts.
That isnrt the answer
to my question, sir.
What you say makes
for a good argument
But it is notpractical.
_ ltrs absolutely practical
There is a provision for it
in our Constitution
Werll only have to pass a
minor ordinance. Thatrs all
24 hours makes no difference.
_ Yourre joking, sir
Yourre the one whors joking.
Occupy my chair for a day...
and you will know
what fires I burn in
What a crown of thorns
I wear on my head!
You will realise how many got
literacy and were rid of poverty
You must sit here then and
I will ask you questions
In this very program.
Do you agree?
Whatrs the C.M. up to?
_ Hers playing a one_day game.
With the C.M.rs chair.
Ever since he has been to Bihar...
he keeps talking nonsense
No, sir. Thatrs your job.
Not mine
Well? Run out of steam already?
You reporters are like dogs,
barking after cars
The moment the car halts, you run
with the tail between your legs
Well? Would you like
to be C.M. for a day?
Itrs a live telecast, my boy.
Everybodyrs watching. Answer me
Take it! Say yes!
Shall we end the interview?
All right, sir. If it
is possible, lrm willing
I will occupy your chair for a day
The C.M. is trapped!
He took this for a party meeting!
Good thing, too. Irll get to work
with an educated C.M. for a day
All right then
Jai Hind
Come on
You gave it to him
Calm down... peace
Mr Chavan is growing senile
He invited that guy to
become the C.M. for a day
Now tell us if there is provision
for this stupidity in the law?
There is. When assembly
is not in session...
this can be done by
passing an ordinance
There is a precedent for this.
_ Whatprecedent?
Someone in Bihar was made a chief
minister overnight recently
And this is what happened when the
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh...
went abroad for a bypass surgery.
- When a leader in Delhi died...
her son was made the Prime Minister.
_ Does he have the right, however?
Neither is he dead nor is he ailing.
He only spoke nonsense on tv
Not so much of English.
Just tell me if this is possible
Itrs possible, sir. You can
use your discretionary powers...
and do it through
a gazetted order
You canrt make an idiot the C.M.!
For that matter, we canrt go
around drinking poison, can we?
Hers right! All this is nonsense
You donrt know politics. That guy
showed on public television...
that the Commissioner did not
take any action because of me
Had I admitted itpublicly
that he was following my orders...
not only would I have
been beaten up...
but the next time I went seeking
votes, the electorate would beat me
So I had to be one_up on him.
_ Thatrs okay, sir...
but what if he does something
seriously wrong for us?
He can do nothing! Till he gets
to know the duties of a C.M.,...
his day will be over. It will
be good for my public image
rrBalraj Chavan kicks his
post to defy allegationsrr
People will get to know how easy
it is to make allegations...
and how difficult it is
to rule a state
You know best. It has to be right,
if you insist
Herers my resignation, Governor
And herers the letter of support,
signed by 188 M.L.Ars...
to make Mr Shivajirao the C.M.
for a day
I, Shivajirao, take the oath...
that I will discharge my duties
as the C.M. of Maharashtra...
to the best of my abilities
By becoming the C.M. for a day...
Shivajirao creates history
in lndian politics
To cover the event we have the
media from all over the world
So letrs meet our new C.M.
Even junior officers
arrive in a Toyota.
And the C.M. comes in a rickshaw?
Looks like the country has a future
From being an ordinary tv reporter
to the C.M.?
Irll talk tomorrow.
Let me work today
You score today
Immediately call heads of all
administrative departments
This is an officer from the r84...
_ No time for introductions, sorry
We have everything, and yet we are
counted among the backward countries
There are three reasons
One, those who donrt discharge
their duties with honesty
Two, those who do not let
others work with honesty
Third are those who abuse
their position and power
Everyone involved in shady deals
either indulges in sycophancy...
flexes muscles,
bribes his way out,...
or parts with a portion of his
ill_gotten wealth to go scotfree
From the peons to the officers,
you have all become corrupt
There are thousands of complaints
against such officers...
but no action is taken. They end up
in dust_gathering files
I want you to move heaven and
earth to dig up all those files
Make telephone calls or
fly around the state
In one hour, I want all those files
If someone takes ill...
Irll personally open a file for him!
What are we going to do
with the files?
Werre going to suspend them all
You have scored a sixer
Have you come to the slums to
distribute foodgrains and clothes?
I donrt think we should have
any slums in the country
The Government built
houses for you, right?
Yes, sir.
_ So whyrre you living here?
Where else will we go? For 2000
families, they give 20 buildings
How many of us can live in there?
- Whors Director of Slum Board?
He was around... come here.
Donrt hide
How many buildings allotted to them?
_ 1680, sir
They claim it was just 20.
What about the rest?
You mustrve given them away
to the ministers, right?
From the land allotted for
these slum-dwellers...
half is swallowed by politicians.
As for the rest of the houses...
75 per cent are taken over by
employees of the housing boards...
and party members. This gentleman
must have 25 of them, right?
If there is anything still
remaining, these folks get it
And theyrre smart guys too.
They rent out the flats they get...
and move over to start new slums.
_ Tukaram got a flat too, sir
He has rented it out to a Sikh
for 2000 Rupees
Why didnrt you take any action
when you know the truth?
You know how ministers...
_ Forget the ministers
Why didnrt you do your duty?
Has the typewriter arrived.
Whatrs your name?
- Mr...
Just tell us your name.
Werll do the rest
Type his suspension order.
_ What are you doing, sir?
Irll die! Please donrt do that, sir!
Forgive me!
Stop it, sir...
Say something, sir...
_ Sure. Type it out quickly
Irll be ruined, sir
Where were you allotted a house?
_ At Shastri Nagar, sir
Come with me
Fetch the trucks and bring all
those people to Shastri Nagar...
who were allotted houses there
_ Very well, sir
Fatso! Kiss your job good bye!
This is the one, sir
What is it?
- Wherers the owner of the flat?
Here I am!
_ What is your name?
Irm Tukaram. And you...?
_ Yourre Tukaram, lrm Bill Clinton
Hers the one whors chief minister
of the state for a day
Why didnrt you tell me?
Come on in, sir...
We arenrt coming in.
Yourre going out
Why am I going out?
- This flat was allotted to Tukaram
And yourre staying here illegally.
_ lrm paying a rent!
Why must I vacate it?
_ If you donrt vacate it...
yourre going to prison.
- Prison?
For eight years.
_ Eight years?! One moment...
Get your stuff, Rajinder Kaur!
Letrs return to Bhatinda
Check all the flats.
I donrt want any outsiders
Irve brought them all, sir
_ Throw out all illegal occupants
These folks will live here now
Once werre gone, if you rent
out your flat again...
and go to live in the slums,
the C.M. will imprison you.
Who wants to live in slums?
Werre unemployed, you see
We rent out the flats to
manage two square meals
Werd be grateful to you if you could
give us some employment, sir
I have become C.M. for only a day.
If you want me to do something
for you, you will have to change
Whatever you buy, from
a needle to a motorcar...
make sure you pay the sales tax
when you buy it
Sales Tax is the governmentrs right.
On a gold_purchase of 1000 rupees...
4 per cent of sales tax
works out to 40 rupees
To save those 40 rupees, you
donrt ask the seller for a bill
He takes advantage of that and
the entire transaction...
goes into his black money which
does not reach the government
So you mustpay the sales tax.
For itrll increase and
reach you finally
Do not buy goods if the seller
does not give you a proper bill
Herers your bill. 440 Rupees.
_ I want a proper bill
Me too
If some refuses to give you a bill,
report him to the police
Those shopkeepers who donrt issue
bills and donrtpay sales tax...
will have their licenses revoked
How much would sales tax amount to?
_ 4 million, sir
How much are we paying now?
_ 400,000
No wonder hers asking. Pay up today,
or herll withdraw our license
Whatrs he up to?
- Hers a moron!
As if the nation will progress
by recovering sales tax
How much is the income
from sales tax in a day?
For us, or the exchequer?
The exchequers!
- I donrt know
So what are you the
revenue minister for?
Whatrs this?
- Get him!
Whatrs this?
_ A magnet
He uses it on the customers
_ How much would it weigh?
About 200 grams
_ 200 grams in two kilos of sugar
How much do you cheat in a day?
Speak up, or yourll get it
Whatrs this?
_ The World Cup
Anyway you measure, you get
2.5 liters instead of 5
Theyrre champions when
it comes to thievery, sir
It all works out
to 1500 Rupees a day
In a month then...
he makes more money than
a chief ministerrs salary
You donrt own the money
They go around the city,
picking up rags
They labor and slog all day
to make the money
What must we do with him?
_ Slipper him!
I suggest we hand him over
to the public
Each one of them will
get 100 grams of him
No. Werll cancel his license.
Whatrs your name?
Give us the real name
or you get hit
Whatrs your name?
_ Satyavan
Conman, eh?
What a C.M. He takes
decisions instantly
Time for public grievances.
Between 12 noon and 1 p.m.
Call number...
I want to talk to the C.M.
- Go on.
Irm calling from a
public hospital in Kolhapur
My son is seriously ill with flu.
Irve had him admitted here
The doctor attending to him
ought to have been here at 10.
But he hasnrt yet turned up.
My sonrs body is on fire!
Please do something, sir
Is anyone in the hospital
around? Put him on the line
This is the Ward Boy, Vithal
- When will the doctor arrive?
Any moment, he should be here.
_ Is he always so late?
He has his own dispensary, you see.
Once he has finished his work there,
herll come here
Whatrs the name of the doctor?
_ l.K. Gadgil
Yourll soon receive a fax.
Give it to the doctor and
tell him he has been suspended.
He mustnrt come to the hospital
again. Let him look after his clinic
Who are you, sir?
Have another doctor attend
to the child immediately
This is Sakubai from Nagpur, sir.
We collected every penny...
and bought a scooter for my husband
so he could go to work
The scooter has been stolen.
Itrs a month...
since we lodged a police complaint.
But nobody takes any action
When we talk to the inspector,
he uses foul language
Please do something, sir.
_ Is the complaint in your name?
My husbandrs name. Atmaram
Sir, this is Atmaram here.
- Go on
I had a lodged a complaint when my
scooter was stolen lost last month
So...?
_ Any news?
People lose huge cars and vans
and therers no trace of them.
So whatrs your scooter worth?
_ What is your name?
Uday Mohite
What will you do with my name?
Big man, eh?
You will complain to the D.S.P.?
Yourll get nothing,
no matter whom you complain to.
Your scooter was opened up and sold.
Go and find it!
Is your fax machine on?
_ What is it to you?
Nothing to me. You have been
sent a suspension order.
Check out if itrs okay,
or lrll send it again
Who are you, sir?
From Thane. An urgent call, sir.
- What is it?
Someone wants to give you...
- Whatrs that?
Lizard! What mischief is this?
Bravo, bat! Great job yourre doing.
Keep it up!
Are you watching tv?
- Yes
What shirt have you worn?
Yourd look great in a blue shirt
A blue shirt...?
All right. Hang up now
A blue-shirt for the C.M.
Is the C.M. there?
- Yes?
Irm calling from
A.M. Womenrs College, sir
Problems of eve_teasing have
crossed their limits, sir
Thugs from a nearby colony
are always harassing girls here
This is an everyday problem, sir.
_ Which is the police station around?
Despite all the complaints the
police are afraid to take any action
Stay there. Werre coming over
Have the area inspector
Hurry up
If only you had taken some action.
- Back off... move!
Who called me...?
- I did
What happened to that girl?
_ Those thugs dragged her...
she was hurt on the head and
had to be rushed to hospital
Follow this up, Mr Bansal
What the hell are you doing when
there are so many complaints?
Itrs a small accident, sir...
_ Hers lying!
Quiet. Irm talking to him.
- You talk.
There are a handful of thugs
in the slums nearby.
Their leader is Ranga,
a political murderer
He has the support of
some political leaders
So nobody says anything to them.
They walk the streets like mad dogs
They make obscene gestures,
grab any girlrs hand...
pat us on our back_sides...
even reach for our breasts
Arenrt you ashamed? What do
you take a salary for?
We canrt go into that area.
An inspector once went there
to catch him.
And they hung his head in the square.
_ Donrt you have a gun?
What sort of a cop are you?
I didnrt have the
Commissionerrs permission
The Minister asked me
not to act, sir
You are all thieves!
Include every name in the list.
Donrt spare anyone
Where does Ranga live?
_ There, on the hillock
Ranga, lrve seen
those slums somewhere
Itrs our area.
Theyrre showing it on tv
Look at him! Isnrt he the C.M.
for the day...?
Itrs him, all right.
Whose room is he getting into?
- Yours
Come to interview me, have you?
Get some make_up done first
Yourll take my pictures?
Itrs like Matrix 2
Kneel down
Women are like my sisters
- Louder!
How much have we collected
from sales tax, Bansal?
No one could have made more
in a day. 2500 million
Invest the whole money in an
employment scheme for the poor
The more capable they are,
the better jobs theyrll land
Is my list ready, Mr Bansal?
_ Yes, sir. A huge pile
Districtwise, talukawise, it tells
of everyone who became a millionaire
This oners of those who donrt
do their duty honesty
These guys interfere with
othersr functions
And those are the guys
who abuse their power
In all, there are 45,518 people
Suspend all of them
Itrll be midnight by the time
you sign so many suspension orders
So issue an omnibus order.
Put it on the internet
Like results of exams, have the
list displayed on notice boards
Irll give the Collectors the
orders to suspend them
There are some Collectors too.
_ You sign their suspension orders
If your name also figures in this,
lrll put my signature on it
I have a tongue that wags, sir.
But my hands are clean
How can they muster the courage
to indulge in such things?
From the Ministers, sir.
They share the spoils too
Which ministers?
- Which one isnrt?
Food, finance, PWD...
12 departments in all
What do we do with these tomcats?
_ Put them in a cage
So do it
Shivajirao, down down!
Move
It had to happen
The police have arrived
I have evidence of corruption
against 12 of your ministers
Irm sorry, but I have no other
option except to arrest them
One punch from me and
yourll spin like a top!
Call them over
Touch anyone, and
lrll break your hands!
Not as easy to do that.
The scribes are all watching
Please ask them to cooperate
Whyrre you guys coming in?
Break the door
I was here to pee
Whatrve you done, Mr Chavan?
_ Go away
Irve achieved nothing in a day,
nor have I served the people
I did only what a chief minister
ought to do
Had you done as much
in the last five years...
our state would have
made greatprogress
Thank you very much
Your day as the C.M. is over.
You may go now
I have 5 minutes to go.
And one last thing to do
You are at the root of
your ministerrs corruption
You play an important role
in their corruptpractices
Hence, I arrest you too
This tomcat wasnrt in our list!
Stop being childish.
You donrt know the law
The Chief Minister isnrt a drunkard
you can lock up at will
You need the Governorrs
approval for that
You need the Supreme Courtrs orders.
There are so many other formalities
Irm sorry, but lrm
the C.M. right now
Yourre a common man
Arrest him
Your good times have begun
Do you have anything to say?
Are the allegations true?
The day hers released,
herll finish me
The lawyers are here
Lawyers
Useless! When will you get me out
of this? Tomorrow theyrll jail me
Do something, quick!
_ Bail has been arranged. Just sign
Werre going to the magistrate
to get hold of a bail order
I want the courts to stay
on all his orders
Irll pass an ordinance to render
the orders null and void
May we leave now?
- Run
Hey Bansal...
_ Bloody fix!
Are you trying to hide?
_ No sir. I was just standing aside
Come here.
_ I canrt bear to see you like this
I just stood in a corner and I wept.
_ Melodrama isnrt working with me
Taught him the ropes, didnrt you?
_ I swear by your chair!
You made him the Chief Minister.
Mine is just a job
To be with the Chief Minister.
I was justputting on a charade
Had he been uneducated, he wouldnrt
have known a thing. It turns out...
he happens to be educated. Worse, he
has brains. In one day, he go it
