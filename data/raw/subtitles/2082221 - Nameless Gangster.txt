-=The War Against Crime:
Golden Age of the Bad Guys=-
Tell me the truth. The water has
splashed all over my body already...
Good afternoon, hyeongnim!
(hyeongnim - respected older brother)
Aigoo, I almost drowned...
(Aigoo - Oh dear/oh my god)
I nearly died...
Good afternoon, hyeongnim!
Enough, drag him out.
Get up, get up now!
President Gim...
Do you think we...
- Please spare me! I'm sorry!
- Let go!
Please spare me, President Gim!
Shut up, you rotten brat!
Aish!
What are you guys standing
there for? Chase after him!
Aish!
Trying to run? Stop there!
Frankly speaking,
opening a hotel doesn't
just rely on room services. 
You are just trying to
deal with my casino.
What did you do with most of
the shares? Then what do i get?
Enough nonsenses, I want
to report to the police.
Director Heo, will that solve the problem?
Anyway, we need to open the place,
and we need them to watch over it.
Did you think I didn't know that?
Furthermore,
how can you treat your partner like this?
Look, look...
See what it has become.
He is also not the
only hooligan in Busan.
I must be really blind,
to cooperate with him just
based on your word...
That brat really makes
me feel apologetic.
How does he think?
At that time, I
confirmed one thing.
We have known each other
for some time already,
so I never thought,
really never thought
that he's such a bastard.
Say your greetings,
this is the Prosecutor.
Prosecutor Jo!
Hey, gangster,
I will now ask you a question.
You just need to answer
yes or no, understand?
You know how to write hangeul, right?
So now,
I want you to write down all the violence
you've instigated towards Director Heo,
as well as all the wrongdoings
you've done in the past.
Every single word has to be neatly
written down.
Since when did you start
your life as a gangster?
And how did you become a ringleader--
Prosecutor...
There seems to be some misunderstandings...
I'm not a gangster.
In what way do I look
like a gangster to you?
I was also a civil servant
once, a civil servant.
- Open the door.
- Yes.
What is going on here?
What are you doing?
Civil servant?
You brat!
If all the crimes in my knowledge that
you've committed is not written down,
or if there's any false bit of statement,
the outcome is your responsibility.
Okay.
What are all these?
Are these supposed to
be pollack fish bait?
You are really living a good life...
Nowadays, Pollack eats red ginseng?
And you're even wearing a gold watch?
Let's go.
Wait...
Actually the Management Division's
Chief Pak and I
are relatives.
Chief Pak said you're his brother.
So I'll let you go this time.
There is absolutely no more next time.
Yes, thank you.
Our Inspection Division,
only consists of those three and I.
It's only the four of us who inspects
these goods that enter the Busan habor.
Do you know how tiring it is?
With only four people
in such a vast area,
sometimes we can't even go home.
Okay, it's done. Let's go.
Wait...
This is not much money,
but take it and have a meal.
You really...
You don't have to
do this, you really...
We are now all part
of the same family.
What have I done wrong?
This is really funny. It's not
like you've seen me do it!
I did see it!
What's going on?
Let's not bother about it.
You came?
What's going on outside?
It's bad.
That ajumma
(ajumma - middle aged woman)
filed a complaint, it is now a mess.
Aish!
Then what are those you're holding?
It's nothing.
You brats.
Have more compassion.
I'm leaving. When it's
time, get off work.
Take care!
Come in.
A little bit faster.
Sit down.
Lightly, lightly.
Don't move.
Hurry up.
- Stand up.
- I've stood up already.
Here, take it.
- Wow, we've earned a lot.
- Stop your nonsense.
Lower your voice,
someone might hear.
- Quickly hide it at another place.
- Move quickly.
What are you rushing for?
Okay,
sit down.
I heard you're a sportsman.
That's right.
Then...
Where do you plan to
live at after marriage?
My workplace, the taekwando dojo.
(dojo - training school)
There's a small room there,
so at the moment, I intend to...
I say, you...
shouldn't see our way of life
as so simple and crude.
Our Gyeongju Choe Chi Won clan
is one with a lot of history.
We also have a lot of successful relatives,
such as judges, prosecutors,
and even professors.
Those popular people of
The Republic of South Korea
are basically all from our clan.
Yes,
I've heard of that.
Let me see...
Here, take it.
Use this money to
rent an entire house.
And also...
Where did it go?
This...
This is a gift.
No, I dare not take it, it's okay.
Just accept it.
Thank you!
What's the use of pretending?
Oppa is already dead...
(oppa - older brother)
I can't watch on any further!
This woman's words are really...
All of you also say your greetings,
he's your uncle.
- Hello.
- Yes, yes.
Ju Han, our family's
3rd generation only son.
Take a good look at Choe Ju Han,
he's going to be an
important figure in the future.
It's here, quickly
come and take a look.
Don't make too much noises.
You're here?
Has everything been settled?
Yes, it's been settled.
Here, have some.
You're quite capable.
You have also heard...
I feel that
our Inspection Division should
also hand over one person.
Then,
who will take the blame?
If I could,
I would come out to take the blame.
But, I'm the Chief.
If the Chief is handed over, punishment
won't be easy for the higher ups either.
So I say,
whoever has the smallest
household among all of you,
should come out and take the blame.
What do you think?
The few of you all
have children already.
Yes, I have 3 sons and 2 daughters.
4 daughters, 1 son.
I have 3 daughters and 2 sons.
Head Choe, what about you?
Yes,
I have 2 daughters and 1 son.
Also, I have 2 sisters
who are getting married.
If you say it that way,
then what about me?
Grandfather and grandmother,
plus 3 younger brothers,
adds up to a total of 10 people!
Hey... let's drink.
Yes, yes, let's have a drink.
Have a drink.
Come, have a drink!
Don't think about it already.
Just give him two thousand,
and you can stay.
Do you think that bastard Chief Jo
will under this kind of situation,
accept the money I give him?
That's why the technique
must be ingenious.
I heard that Chief Jo's
brother is severely ill,
and operation fees are rather expensive.
You can try and see whether this method works.
I don't care how much money he has,
just throw it all out.
The first time because of dispatch,
I received five hundred,
and the transferring department
received five hundred.
And now?
Am I the only one receiving bribes?
What are you guys doing?
We have some work to do.
It's so late already, what kind
of work do you have to do?
It's the first time I'm hearing this.
It's all done.
- It's all done.
- Hey,
What do you guys do?
What do you guys do?
What are you doing? Rotten brat!
You brat...
Rotten brats, you guys are dead!
Let's go!
You brat!
You brat!
You brat!
You want to fight me?
Director Jang! Director Jang!
You brats, stop there!
Leave quickly, leave quickly!
- Didn't you say there was no one?
- How would I know?
- Get out of the way, bastard!
- What are you doing? Just drive!
Get out of the way, crazy guys!
What are you doing? Drive faster!
Stop there!
What happened?
Open it and take a look.
Crazy...
These bastards...
Head Jang,
what are you worried about?
Is there a crazy person
who would come out to accuse himself
as the person trafficking Philopon?
(Philopon - Highly abusive drug to
improve mental/physical functions.)
It's just to be safe...
Director Jang...
Hyeongnim! Let's just do it.
Then I will take the blame and be
the scapegoat without complaints
and leave directly.
I mean it.
Really?
You can't.
Let's just forget it.
Honestly speaking,
going to Japan to sell Philopon,
what is there to worry about?
Also,
our country
has been a colony for so
many years, isn't that right?
How many years already?
30 years already.
30 years?
To be exact, it's 36 years.
I'll be honest.
I want to sell Philopon to Japan,
and let those Japanese
savages who deserve to die
all breath in Philopon
and die so that we can be relaxed.
How do we express the love for our country?
We should have some areas
that are stronger than Japan, right?
Don't you think so, hyeongnim?
I think so too.
Then...
Over there,
there's a gangster
who knows the Japanese gangster society.
Okay...
Forget it.
I still think it's better not to do it.
Come.
Long time no see.
I'm sorry, there was something to attend to
so I came a bit late.
All right then...
It's nice to meet you,
I am Choe Ik Hyeon.
I'm Choe Hyeong Bae.
Let's go.
So, let's discuss official matters.
Chief Choe, is it?
Yes.
I see that you
are only a small official.
Are you able to handle the consequences?
Let's do it this way.
We'll count the number of grams,
and I'll give you 3.5 million
for every kilogram.
I'll pay for the shipping fees.
No bargaining, it will be 50:50.
what do you think?
Let's do it that way then.
I say, Mr. Hyeong Bae,
oh...I actually called you Mr. Hyeong Bae,
I'm sorry.
This is called court entanglement.
Just now was I behaving inappropriately?
It's okay. Up to you, up to you.
Then... Prince Hyeong Bae?
Then just call me President Choe.
Yes, President Choe.
Let me boldly ask something.
What Choe clan are you in?
Gyeongju Choe clan.
What faction?
The valiant faction.
I knew it.
The Bae from Hyeong Bae
is from the generation of Bae.
Gyeongju Choe Clan Valiant faction's
39th generation grandson?
Yes, right.
You brat!
I'm considered your paternal
great-great grandfather's grandson!
I'm Gyeongju Choe Clan Valiant faction's
35th generation grandson.
Chief Choe, you're drunk.
Stop joking around.
I knew it.
The first time I saw you
with these facial features,
you looked like you're from our clan.
Look at this physique.
That...
How do I address your father?
Choe Mu Ja.
Mu Ja. Choe Mu Ja, Choe Mu Ja...
Could it be that...
Person who was working
on a ship a few years back?
Yes, right.
You brat, you brat!
I'm very familiar with your father!
Brat! What should you do when you see
your great-great-grandfather's grandson?
When you see your grandfather,
you should kowtow to pay respects.
Quick, pay your respects!
Why are you stunned?
Hurry up and pay your respects now!
Aigoo, aigoo, let me go, let me go.
Look at what he has already become...
Don't do this.
Stop.
Forget it.
Hey, ajussi.
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)
It's for you to get sober.
Why are you back so late? Rotten brat!
When your father calls you,
you should hurry back!
Hyeong bae, greet your big father.
He helped me a lot when I was working,
and also knew a lot of people over there.
He is a really good person.
So in the future,
you must treat him well.
You must be respectful,
do you understand?
You brat!
Hurry kowtow to pay respects!
- I'm very sorry, big father.
- It's okay, it's okay...
Very good.
Check it and see.
Is there a need to check?
This is really...
About that time before,
I'm really sorry.
What are you saying?
It was nothing.
It's only a trifle matter,
you don't need to worry.
Do you have anything on tonight?
Let's have a meal together.
Okay, let's do that.
I should treat you to a meal,
since this huge matter is done.
Let's go.
But, it's only for a meal.
Oh, right.
He's the man under me who's
responsible for overall matters.
If you have any work in the future,
you can just ask him to do them.
Say hello.
Nice to meet you.
I am Pak Jang Woo.
Yes, we've met before.
If you have nothing on
then join us for a meal.
Okay, let's go together.
Look after the brothers.
Take care.
Hyeong Bae,
after seeing you, I really...
You mustn't misunderstand.
It's like after seeing a woman,
and falling in love at first sight.
It's like
my whole body is being electrified.
I really...
never expected our family to have
a talent like you.
Yes, right.
But I'm not a talented person.
You are a talent.
Hyeong Bae,
I see that
you take some medicines occasionally.
What's wrong? Where are
you feeling unwell?
It's just a painkiller.
My leg is a little uncomfortable.
Is it due to fighting?
Nope, last time in the
Samchon education group,
I was beaten when being
pulled to join the army.
It's been really hard on you.
Hyeong Bae,
from now on,
there will definitely
be no more such thing.
You can just tell me.
I and
all those officials
do not just have a simple relationship.
Jang Wu,
your singing is really good!
Your voice
is really good.
Let me see...
for you.
Thank you!
Jang Wu,
go to the toilet with me.
Chief Choe...
What is it?
Chief Jo...
Why are you here?
And why are you here?
Come, let me introduce everybody.
This was one of my co-workers last time.
Do you remember I told you that there was an
incredibly interesting attendant in my company?
So it's actually this person.
I'm very happy to meet you.
Yes, I'm Choe Ik Hyeon and I am
also very happy to meet you.
Let me toast a cup to everyone.
- Yes, okay.
- Have a cup.
I always hear him mentioning you.
I'm really happy to be able to meet you.
It's nice meeting you.
Come, let's have a drink together.
Yes, have a cup.
Come, cheers!
Cheers!
All Presidents,
please feel free to make
requests to our Chief Jo.
I don't deserve it.
Even though our Chief Jo is like this,
but his heart
is very wide and
very big.
His that thing is also very big.
What is wrong with you?
Are you drunk?
I'm not drunk.
I'm originally more interesting.
You brat, you're really drunk.
If you're drunk, then go home.
If you want me to shut up,
I have no choice but to do so.
So...
I'll leave first.
Are you leaving?
The four of you,
our Chief Jo, no... it's our golf ball Jo,
I'll count on you all to
buy him more delicious food.
From time to time, also help
him with blowing his nose.
You brat, what nonsense
are you talking about?
Are you insane?
What is it?
Have I said wrongly?
Doesn't our Mr. golf ball
like blowing his nose?
Why don't I help you with
blowing your nose today?
You bastard!
On what basis did you hit me for?
Damned bastard!
Today, you're going to die!
Go to hell!
What are you doing? You brat!
You bastard!
I was not your attendant!
What are you looking at?
A bunch of bastards!
Two thousand to three thousand
isn't bad either.
Just needing to find a good place
is nothing much to worry about.
There won't be much expenses,
it's enough to just be able to eat.
Okay, I'll give it a try.
Talking about gambling,
doesn't everyone go crazy?
Today's weather is really nice!
Hyeong Bae, for a person like me,
I should have become a soldier, right?
Life's path is really not smooth!
The coffee is still very hot.
You're still alive...
What are you doing?
I feel embarrassed.
It's still supported.
Let's me first explain matters regarding
Choe Ik Hyeon's involvement and arrest.
The operator of a hotel in Busan, Ho Sang Sik,
on 5th November 1990 at 2 pm in the afternoon,
for an unknown reason was
at the hotel when the head of
a gangster group, Gim Pan Ho,
imprisoned and assaulted him.
Regarding this, Ho Sang Sik has
identified the mastermind as Choe Ik Hyeon,
and stated that this case is related
to a dispute at the casino
owned by Gim Pan Ho and his men.
=Regarding yesterday's urgent
arrest of Choe Ik Hyeon,=
=the police agency announced that
they would apply for an arrest warrant.=
=Gim Pan Ho, the leader of the gang who
directly used violence during the police hunt=
=as well as other related
people will be investigated.=
=This is reported by Gim Seong Eeon.=
Several men has already been arranged
to keep watch at the entrance of
the house of Gim Pan Ho's woman.
Yes, there are currently three from our team.
President Choe,
how is it?
Are you able to take it?
Warden Seo, let me make a phone call.
Aigoo, really...
=Hey, I'm Choe Ik Hyeon.=
-=Busan Prosecutor's Office.=-
Oh, Prosecutor Jo,
come over here and say your greetings.
This is Prosecutor Choe Ju Dong,
the department head of the East branch
and your 6th generation senior.
Hello, I'm Jo Beom Seok
from the 14th generation.
Prosecutor Jo,
Choe Ik Hyeon is my family,
so I understand him very well.
It's a fact that he stays in contact with
a few members of the gangster society.
But although it's a fact...
In other words, if Prosecutor Jo was
to keep in contact with gangsters,
does it mean you're also a gangster yourself?
I'm really sorry, but I can still make
this kind of basic judgement.
How can a person who's able to
make basic judgements conduct
investigations using this type of method?
Choe Ik Hyeon was a civil servant, a civil servant.
You know Choe Hyeong Bae right?
Do you mean Choe Hyeong Bae,
the ringleader of the gangster society?
Yes,
Choe Hyeong Bae, the ringleader
of the gangster society.
He is Choe Ik Hyeon's nephew.
Did you know that?
Is it like that?
See, see...
How do you investigate when your
intelligence capability is so bad?
Hey, from what you said,
if Choe Ik Hyeon is a gangster,
then under normal circumstances, he
should be mixing with Choe Hyeong Bae.
Not join up with Gim Pan Ho who's confronting
Choe Hyeong Bae, don't you think so?
You... I also used to work on a investigation
case related to the gangster society!
This... I'm really sorry, sunbaenim.
(sunbaenim - respected senior/mentor)
After listening to what you said,
it seems that our Prosecutor Jo
has made some obvious mistakes.
We will definitely start anew and
investigate based on principles.
Then, let us have a meal together first.
You have no relations with
Gim Pan Ho, is that what you mean?
Yes,
that's what I mean.
So...
You have no relationship with the
case of violence towards Director Heo.
Do not change your statement in the future.
You can go back for today.
But there's one thing...
That we have to remember.
If I were to start my
investigation over again,
and if I were to discover that your
statements contain a bit of false content,
then you can't blame me
when that time comes.
Go.
Can you give me a cup of rice wine?
Bring some rice wine.
Okay, how many cups do you need?
2 cups.
Aigoo, President Heo...
Aigoo, who is this? Isn't this Director Choe?
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at the customs at this time?
Looks like President Heo still doesn't know
I already left the customs roughly 3 years ago.
How could you bear to give up a
place that is as fatty as an egg yolk?
A person's career
is better to be based on interest.
When you do business in the future,
you can also recommend me any
good projects that you may have.
Okay, no problem.
Nice to meet you, hyeongnim.
Okay.
Get back to work.
Yes, hyeongnim.
Who are they?
Children who do odd jobs for me.
Are you busy?
Oh, no... Please call me again
when there's something you need.
Okay...
It's really cooling!
About that... Director Choe,
I'm not sure whether I should
ask you this question,
but by any chance do you know
anyone from the gangster society?
There's still so many
people on an ordinary day,
how can this business
not have any earnings?
My sediments exactly!
Look at that guy over there with a beard.
Those are the people I told you about.
President Choe, just like you
can see, the business is so good.
When the bill is due at the end of the
month, reception fees and funds are all
deducted from the earnings until none is left.
Let's not talk about monthly profits,
just for operating costs alone, I will
have to put in several hundreds.
Hyeong, you're really foolish.
(Hyeong - elder brother)
Do you plan to just keep watching on
without saying anything about it?
Then what do you expect me to do?
Who brought those fellows here?
Among our shareholders here, we have a
female President who holds 40% of the shares,
she was the one who brought them over.
In my opinion, it's that female
President who is colluding with them,
and monopolizes all the money each month.
Hyeong, what percentage of
the shares do you own?
(Hyeong - elder brother)
24%.
Quick, look.
He is Gim Pan Ho, the Senior Manager here.
Just now, that guy with the
beard is also under him.
As far as I know, he is the number one
most outstanding gangster in Busan.
With two big cheques, he gave it to me based
on the price he bought it for 2 years ago.
His relationship with me is really good.
Pan Ho used to be one of our brothers,
although he left to be on his own after that.
But no matter what... even though
he is not in the same gang,
I also do not have an excuse to come forward.
Is it?
They are so powerful that's
why you can't deal with them.
Big father, it is not like this.
I do not have an excuse... an excuse.
There are also rules among gangs.
If based on war, we will surely win.
Chief Go, I don't want this,
- Is there abalone that
is freshly brought in today?
- Yes.
President, the wifes of
today's get-together are leaving.
Is that so? Hyeong Bae, you can eat first.
Chief Go, you've become prettier.
You're leaving already?
How was the food?
Aigoo, thanks to you,
we ate really well today.
All right.
Jong Ping, uncle will give
you some pocket money.
Omo, why do you give the
children so much money? It's really...
Aish, they are finally gone.
Wow, big father, aren't you too busy?
Why do you waste so much
effort on those ajummas?
Those ajummas are the wifes of the
people who settled your approval problem.
Otherwise, why would I
treat them to a free meal?
Oh, right.
Hyeong Bae,
just now you said you do not have a excuse.
Aren't we a family?
Is there any other excuse in the world
that is more important than this?
If what I said was incorrect,
you can just say it. Isn't it?
Why? Are you not willing?
You don't have confidence?
I don't know how hyeongnim thinks of me...
But no matter how you say it, I'm still
a person who practices martial arts.
By you letting me manage
a nightclub is a bit...
Aigoo, aigoo... you really speak nonsense.
You selfish bastard!
Do you intend to let your
children live the life like you do?
You should at least not let your
children have to do others bidding,
and live presentably.
Rotten brat...
Aigoo, you've come.
You're here.
It's here.
Oh, is it here?
Yes.
Aigoo, how is everyone?
Aigoo, Director Heo you're here.
It's been a long time.
You've come really early.
Take a sit.
I'm sorry that I'm late.
I am Choe Ik Hyeon and I will be working
together with everyone from today onwards.
This is President Yeo.
Is that so? I've heard President Heo
mentioning you many times.
You're more beautiful then what I've heard.
Is it?
Why don't you greet one another?
This is Gim Pan Ho, our Senior Manager.
It's nice to meet you.
I have also roughly heard,
but what is the reason for
gathering all of us here?
The way our President Yeo
speaks is really cute.
Okay then,
I'll be straightforward.
From today onwards,
I want to confirm the admission ticket
sales as well as the daily sales.
As far as I know, there is a lot
of unnecessary expenses.
How can such a thing happen
in a legitimate business?
And the 2nd thing is,
to prevent this kind of situation,
I have to arrange for
1 person to be here.
What kind of person?
This person.
He has more experience in this area,
and his personal ability is also
stronger. He will be helpful to
all the Presidents in the future.
Damn it!
I really can't listen on any further.
What? Where are you from?
We don't even know where you're from
and yet you're here ordering us around!
What are you doing? Sit down.
Sit down.
What are you? Which gang are you from?
Sit down.
What are you doing? Can't you see
we are having a discussion here?
I'm sorry, hyeongnim.
Hey, partner,
I see that you aren't very young anymore, but
why do you plan things so unsatisfactorily?
You're afraid already aren't you?
oppa,
I don't know which gang
you were with in the past,
but I feel that it'll be
better for you to stop here.
You rotten bitch, what did you say?
You bastard!
Are you asking to die?
Damned bastard!
Let go of me!
Bastard!
Do you know who I am?
Quickly let me go!
Okay, you dare to treat me like this...
Bastards, you're all dead!
Leave quickly, it's been settled.
Bastard!
You still don't want to leave?
Leave!
Just wait and see.
We scared them.
Wow, those rotten brats.
I can even win them even if
it's a 1 against 1 fight.
It's true.
Hyeong Bae,
Hyeong Bae, it's done. Let's go.
Jang Wu.
Brothers, let's go!
Rotten brats, what are you doing?
Go to hell!
Bastard!
Dog bastard!
You bastard!
Bastard, where are you running to?
What are you bastards doing?
I also just heard.
Although this is your area,
but since this is related to my
family, shouldn't I take care of it?
Then, let's do it this way.
Both of us send half the men,
and I'll use redundancy payments
to let my men take some money.
Okay.
I'm okay with the redundancy
payments for your men.
I will greet the proprietor and
satisfy your request the best I can.
But, your men can't remain here.
How can 1 business location
have men from 2 different gangs?
You brat.
I also have a family.
This brat actually called me a brat.
Listen to me,
I'm also a person with self-esteem.
Your men dragged me along by pulling
my hair even though I'm already
40 years old, of course I'll be angry.
But I endured it on Hyeong Bae's account.
About what happened just now,
I apologize to you once again.
Is President Yeo your woman?
You felt ashamed infront of
him that's why you're like this?
Brat, what are you talking about?
Brat?
Come, light a cigarette for me.
Light it.
Light it for me.
You're really... did President Choe
eat something wrong today?
Hyeong Bae,
I am no longer
the young Gim Pan Ho who
used to light your cigarette.
Looks like it's not going to work,
you need to endure some beating.
Brat, do you have a smoke?
Resist, resist...
Resist, hinder,
tolerate. The synonyms are oppose,
count and contest.
You're very prevalent today,
why do you have to make daddy angry
when you can do well if you put in effort?
Next.
Next.
Mr. Choe Ik Hyeon,
let's talk for a while.
I've given the Senior Manager position to you,
and I've given the Operating Manager
position to you too!
And now you still want to be the Arrangement
Manager, are you trying to take everything?
Calm down for a while,
I've checked carefully. You've stolen quite
a lot of money while you were the Manager.
Are you eating the leftover rice
grains on a beggar? Bastard!
What? Who do you think you are?
What? Steal?
Who stole? I think you're the
one who stole it, you bastard!
Bitch, are you crazy?
Bastard, you hit me?
Go on and hit me, bastard!
Bastard, bastard!
You crazy old woman!
You still dare to... go to hell!
Bend over!
Quickly bend over! Fasten it.
Where are you running to?
I'll let you run.
Catch everyone!
This way.
What is it?
This way!
Stop there!
Listen to me, 
I'm a customer, a customer.
Hurry up!
Brat.
Come here!
Sit here.
You look younger than me,
talk politely.
Brat, you can still retort? Quick sit down!
Rotten brat, are you crazy?
You actually dare to hit me?
Where's your Director?
Get Director Jang here!
Do you know who am I?
Your Director and I are very close!
Sir...
What kind of relationship do
you have with our Director?
- Does your Director live in Nampo-dong?
- Yes.
Your Director and I
still ate and went to the sauna
together the day before yesterday.
Bastard, are you done talking?
If that's the case... then apologize first.
Bastard!
I'm sorry.
Take care, hyeongnim.
Hyeongnim is leaving.
Hyeongnim.
I feel that Pan Ho and
President Yeo are in cahoots.
If no one instigated them, we wouldn't
have been arrested at the same time.
Is it disadvantageous to us?
I'm fine with it, but the main
problem is it affects you.
Pan Ho was injured rather severely,
he's hospitalized for 12 weeks.
Why did you hit him so ruthlessly?
That brat has no sense of shame,
he's a gangster yet he sued me for
beating him a few times? Bastard.
It's not like there's no solution,
so don't worry too much about it.
What solution?
Oh uncle, you're here.
Aigoo, our Ju Dong, how have you been?
Greet each other, this is the
person I mentioned last time,
Mr. Choe Ik Hyeon. We are all family.
Hello. I'm Choe Ju Dong.
It's nice to meet you, Prosecutor Choe.
If based on generations, you guys are
considered to be 10th generation relatives.
If it's like this...
it means he is your father's,
which is my brother's grandfather's
9th generation younger brother's grandson.
Oh, yes...
Yes, yes.
Prosecutor, it seems that my
subordinate made a mistake,
that's why it was like that.
I will contact you again once I've reconfirmed.
=You really don't understand,=
=what else is there to confirm?=
Director Jang,
Choe Ik Hyeon's case is considered to
be a dispute problem between partners.
Choe Hyeong Bae and Gim Pan Ho's
case should be dealt with separately.
Don't you understand?
=I understand. You meant to
handle both cases separately.=
Exactly.
And also, Choe Hyeong Bae's
purely violent behavior,
is there a need to detain him?
Can't both parties just talk things over?
Okay, I will convey it to them.
Okay, I'm hanging up.
I've already told him very clearly,
he should settle it properly.
Actually, there's no need to do that.
This is...
Aren't golden frogs famous as thanksgiving gifts?
This fellow clearly knows
how to show gratitude.
It looks like it really has loyalty.
It's been tough for you.
After that, I facilitated a
close relationship with him.
After he called,
aigoo, he really did as what he was told.
That is too funny!
Aish, I really... this brat...
Big father,
I originally do not really believe others
because I've been cheated too many times.
Until now, I've encountered
5 times of difficulties,
all because of the kids by my
side who try to make me happy.
Yes, there's no other animals
as treacherous as people.
That's why I've been enlightened,
there's no one you can
trust more than your family.
Big father,
because of you by my side,
that's why I'm very relieved.
I love you.
Hyeong Bae,
let's not have that kind of
relationship that's based on benefits.
We should integrate as 1.
You use this, while I use this,
and this time let's join
together to make a big scene.
The universe's breath is enveloping us.
Okay, okay.
I wish the best for the
future of everyone present.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Let me formally introduce.
I have mentioned it last time. Regarding
the investment this time for the hotel,
and the person who contacted
the Government officials,
is my big father.
This is our 1st meeting,
I am Choe Ik Hyeon.
This is our 1st meeting,
I'm Kaneyama Chaitokku.
I'm very grateful for your big help.
He was saying thank you.
This is a gift for you.
Thank you.
Committee member Pak and President
Uhm asked me to make a trip there.
I'll have to make a closing.
Oh, you're here.
Let's greet each other.
Looks like this is
Chairman Kaneyama Chaitokku.
This is Department Chief Choe of our
party's Busan Operation Department.
What are you doing? You have
to bow at a 90 degree angle
infront of a Government official.
Do it again.
I'm sorry, it's his 1st time meeting someone
of a high status so he's probably nervous.
Hyeongnim.
This is a tablet of gratitude.
For the successful opening
of the Seoul Olympic Games,
thank you for your support.
This is a special award.
And also, this is a souvenir.
It's called hodori, the Olympic Games mascot.
(hodori - 1988 mascot of Seoul Summer Olympic Games)
It's made of gold.
I have already consulted regarding the hotel's
casino project, so you don't need to worry.
The opening ceremony will begin now.
The tape cutting ceremony will begin now.
Today will be a day that will change history.
1... 2... 3.
President Choe, did you put in too much effort?
I heard that you guys have
really collaborated. Is that true?
Is it pretty?
What do you mean by we have collaborated?
Opening 1 or 2 casinos is nothing.
I'll feel great only if I open a few hundred
places like that Cheon Deok Cheong in Seoul.
Aigoo, a person's desire really has no limits.
No matter what you do, there
must be a beginning and an end.
Only unless you reach the peak, if not you
cannot give up midway. Do you know why?
When I was younger, my household
was the wealthiest in our village,
and we also had a lot of land.
We also had a lot of cattle.
But when my father was unsuccessful
during the Congress member election,
we lost our entire fortune.
And my father couldn't take
the blow and passed away.
He won the 2nd position in the election,
but what's the use of being 2nd?
The 2nd position meant that you lost.
Eventually because my father
only got the 2nd position,
that was why I had to go through
so much hardships in this place.
Why did you stop working at the customs?
Why? It's because I'm considered
a number 1 boss in Busan,
just that I do not know what
ranking I'm at in the whole country.
What are you talking about? Isn't
Hyeong Bae in the number 1 position?
What are you saying? Of course
Hyeong Bae is below me.
Besides knowing how to manage
his men, what else can he do?
I just need to say 1 sentence
and it will be the end for him.
Aigoo, then doesn't that make you his head?
It doesn't necessarily 
need to be said like that,
but you can probably 
say so in certain aspects.
They are the "Fire Engines".
- Doesn't seem so.
- Hey,
can't you tell? They are fake.
You brat...
Do you know who I am?
Go and get back to work.
Hey, Section Head Pak,
come over here, let's talk.
What is the matter?
Let's talk about it next time.
Brat, let's talk now. Come here.
You guys leave first.
Come here.
Ajumma, go out first.
Is that "Fire Engine"?
Bastard, is that "Fire Engine"?
Nope... but I have no choice
since I couldn't invite them.
Aren't they pretty good too?
Weren't you the one who said you could
invite them? Didn't you say your
relationship with them is very good?
Who cares whether or
not our relationship is good,
if they don't want to come, what can I do?
Then what about the
15 million won for inviting them?
Of course I gave it to them already.
Rotten brat, don't try to cheat me.
Hey brat, I have also heard about it.
What? What did you hear?
Didn't you give them 2 million? What
happened to the remaining 13 million?
Let's split half each.
What did you say?
I'm also an experienced person.
Matters regarding money must be
counted properly. Quickly pass it to me.
Why are there suddenly
so many mosquitoes?
Dog bastard, I'm not joking with you,
quick hand over the money!
I don't have it, rotten brat.
Wow, this brat really
doesn't what's good for him.
Brat, do you want a spin kick?
If you don't want a beating then 
quickly hand over the money.
Do you understand?
Rotten brat, I'm a 7th grader in Taekwondo.
Aish!
What are you?
What did you say just now?
Who do you think you are?
What did you say to me?
I dare you to say it again. Be careful
or else I'll tear your mouth apart.
Are you crazy? Quick pay your respects to me.
Pay your respects.
Oh, you're here.
Bastard!
Bastard, are you crazy?
I'm really unlucky today,
really unlucky!
Unlucky?
Hyeongnim, stop it.
Hyeongnim, what do you think you're doing?
Let go, you bastard!
You're going to die today!
Do you want to die?
Dog bastard, continue, 
I dare you to continue!
- Hyeongnim, hyeongnim...
- Let go, I asked you to let go!
Hyeongnim,
Hyeongnim...
Let go! Let me go!
What are you doing?
Hyeongnim, you're here.
Oh Hyeong Bae, you've come.
Do you know what this brat has done today?
Bastard, you're dead today!
Big father, next time if you want to
punish my man, don't do it personally,
you can just tell me.
Hyeongnim.
What's happening here?
Don't you know? Those are Pan Ho's men.
I heard they wanted to get
rid of you and Hyeong Bae.
Now is a critical period.
What are you saying?
At this critical juncture
why on earth did Pan Ho come?
Isn't it all because of the casino this time?
It's his domain but we
opened a hotel here.
Crazy guy, that was due to our own efforts
and it was all arranged by the top.
Anyway we cannot just sit around and do
nothing. Let's make pre-emptive measures.
Okay, I know.
Let everybody leave.
Why are the 5 of you gathering together?
What are you standing
here for? Let them disperse!
I'll ask hyeongnim before dispersing them.
Bastard!
Look at the way you speak.
Are only Hyeong Bae's commands
considered commands, while mine are not?
You dog bastard!
Is Hyeong Bae upstairs?
Tell me.
We just started business, do
they want to mess it up?
Who's going to take responsibility?
Big father, a student is considered
a student only if they learn properly,
and a gangster is only considered
to be one if they fight when they have to.
Not just depending on the ability with words.
Are you deliberately
saying this for me to hear?
Hyeong Bae,
we should discuss it together properly.
I'll go and see Pan Ho
and see what he thinks.
As gangsters, to live or die is our own
problem so let's see to it ourselves.
But this time, don't bother about it.
What you said is really hurtful.
Aren't we aboard the same ship?
Then until now, for whom have I been
busy for? What do you regard me as?
What are you doing?
Then, are you a gangster?
Let me ask you, who do think you are?
You should know what
situation the country is in, right?
Now is not the time to
fight over a small domain.
Soon I will try to create an opportunity
for the both of you to reconcile.
Forget it...
Don't meddle with other people's affairs,
think about where your position should be.
Of course I know this world.
Because of President Choe,
all my men lost their jobs.
They are all ignorant, they
wouldn't understand what
situation you're talking about.
That's why I say...
Is this the only time that's
considered a problem?
Next time when there is a
hotel project, I will help you.
This is also not the only hotel.
Now times are so good,
in a few years, there will
be a lot of casinos in Busan.
When that time comes, it'll be
difficult to find a talented person.
This is such a good period.
Why don't we just directly 
do business together?
Using your contacts and my
ability, we'll definitely be successful.
What you said was...
We are also not children, how
can there be 2 gangs together?
For example, if you were to pass the
hotel's operating authority to me,
with Hyeong Bae's personality,
will he just let it go?
So what if he can't let it go?
What else can he do?
He also doesn't think about
who he depends on for a living.
Don't bother about Hyeong Bae.
I can do what I want.
What can he do about that?
Mr. Choe, it's not easy for us to meet,
so why don't we go to a quiet
place and have some soju?
(soju - native Korean distilled alcohol)
Let's just end here, I'm a little busy today.
Yes, you seem very busy.
=The Democratic Party's Presidential
candidate, President Ro Tae Wu,=
=through today's speech...=
Hyeongnim, I'm back.
Have you booked the room?
Yes, room 706 at a nearby hotel.
You go back 1st, I'll go there myself.
Hyeongnim, will you be okay?
It's okay, you go back 1st.
Anyway the car can't be driven over.
I understand, then I'll go back 1st.
Rest well, hyeongnim.
Oh... of course.
Where is it?
Overthrow Jun Du Hwan!
Overthrow the dictatorship!
Overthrow the dictatorship!
Overthrow the dictatorship!
Overthrow Jun Du Hwan!
Release the students!
Overthrow the dictatorship!
Overthrow Jun Du Hwan!
Open up extension into China!
Ajussi, come over here for a moment.
Whats the matter?
Overthrow the dictatorship!
Overthrow the dictatorship!
What happened?
Overthrow the dictatorship!
- Is he inside?
- Yes.
Aigoo, what happened?
- It's nothing.
- How can it be nothing?
It's not a slight wound.
What did the doctor say?
Big father, please go out for a while.
Oh, okay.
I'll come by again.
Let's go.
We cannot let those 2 people go.
Your condition is inconvenient,
so I'll see what I can do about it.
Go in and beat them!
Rotten brats...
Bastards!
Son-of-a-bitch!
Aish!
Lift your head up.
Where is your leader?
I don't know.
[.]
He's really cute.
You can even collaborate with Pan Ho,
and work with him even though
you have to listen to whatever he says.
Do you think we're easy to bully because 
you have accumulated sufficient power?
Brat!
Bury him.
There's so much to do, even my back hurts.
It hurts so much.
Let me go...
Please help me...
Aish!
Why did you do something useless?
And why would we have to
go through this trouble?
Urinate on him.
It's refreshing, right?
This is a good medicine.
Hyeongnim, eat more.
Add a little more.
Oh, it's really good.
I'm hungry.
- Let's go and eat.
- Yes.
What shall we eat?
Let's continue showing him what we can do.
Let's go.
We can go after we're done.
It should be good.
Hyeongnim,
he's still alive.
Of course he's still alive.
Go in.
Hyeong Bae,
regarding your thoughts about the
relationship between Pan Ho and I.
Although I do not know
where you heard it from,
but as you understand,
those are not the truth.
Not only these,
I don't know what other areas
I've made you unhappy about,
but anyway, I'm sorry.
Can you
tell the children
properly
that as a father,
I cannot let the children become undisciplined.
All these...
I have already explained to them,
and didn't let them use knifes.
Thank you.
Are you busy today?
Can you and I
have a drink together?
Okay, I got it.
Take care of your body.
I'm leaving.
Big father,
listen carefully.
Don't ever
take half a step into our world.
And manage what you say,
do you understand?
The casino shares
as well as the nightclub shares.
as well as the nightclub shares.
100 million cash and 100 million in cheque,
total 200 million.
Is this all?
Why are you giving me this?
And this is for expressing apology.
It's a festival gift from hyeongnim.
You're injured,
so stay at home and recuperate
and eat some good food.
Don't worry,
my lips are tight.
Why?
You're not done talking?
Hyeongnim,
the mid-autumn festival is in a few days time.
I have to send a set of dried
salted yellow croaker home,
you should give me some pocket money.
Brat!
For a fellow who snatches domains
and fights on the streets,
he depended on me for a living,
yet this bastard actually treated me like that.
Dog bastard!
Hyeongnim, please keep the gun before talking.
Do you know where I can get bullets?
Hyeongnim, I will go and find out,
keep the gun...
It's been a long time, President Choe.
You've come.
President Gim.
President Gim.
I know, okay...
You've drank so much.
Hyeongnim, be careful.
I know, you're really...
I dare to bet
that if that kind of project 
isn't arranged by the top,
- there's absolutely no way
development can continue.
- You're right, President Gim.
That's what I thought too.
That brat Hyeong Bae has
been like that since young.
He only cares about himself, bastard.
Rotten brat.
Aigoo, with President Choe's relationship with me,
the conversations have become much more awkward.
From today onwards, let's just 
directly call each other by names.
I'll also call you hyeong.
Okay, let's do it this way.
Cheers.
Pan Ho,
thank you.
[.]
Where can there be eternal brothers here?
Friends are the most beneficial.
If there's no benefits, then you'll be enemies.
Choe Ik Hyeon and Gim Pan Ho have collaborated.
I hope the hotel, giant hotel
and several casinos will be completed.
Give them to Gim Pan Ho.
This is more fun than what I've expected.
Anyway,
after removing the casino
and hotel operating authorities,
as well as the internal settings,
that hold chain is in Choe Ik Hyeon's hands.
Director Heo and I and are only playing
small roles and are ordered around by him.
What can I possibly do?
We have to give him money when he wants it,
and he leaves when he wants to.
Where is Gim Pan Ho now?
You guys have hanged around
each other for so long already,
you should know some
hiding places he can be at.
Quickly speak up.
As everyone knows,
the project regarding the war
against crime issued by the President
will began from today onwards
at the Busan Prosecutor's Office.
Directed against the 34 gangs who
conduct their activities in the Busan region,
551 violence prevention organization
personnel will conduct enforcement arrestments.
According to the relevant
police law enforcement provision,
those currently listed in the
Busan's gangsters name list
can all be arrested without an arrest warrant.
If anyone retaliates,
you're permitted to open fire.
=President Choe,=
=escape quickly,=
=the operation here has started. Quickly!=
Don't move!
Lower your head!
Arrest them!
="The War Against Crime" promulgation is over.=
=The majority of members from violent 
gangs have been arrested in 1 day.=
=This was unprecedented=
=and has alarmed the 21st century.=
=According to rumors,=
=the incident to root out violent gangs,=
=has only stopped for a while.=
But the search will continue...
For the time being,
hide yourself well.
After the liberation of the
most difficult prosecutor,
those fellows
seemed to have all gone mad.
This is the 1st time in my life seeing
a person who doesn't like money.
If it continues like that,
won't everyone be arrested?
Do you know what this is?
This is
a phone book worth 1 billion. 1 billion!
They...
Are definitely be unable to find you.
Just wait and see.
God, I pray that you can reward them.
They are suffering from hardships,
and they firmly believe God's promise.
We come forth to the Lord,
to ask for your help.
Please bless me.
Hold it.
It's out today.
President Choe?
What is this about?
The color of your necktie is really pretty.
Yes, right...
Madam today is also not just an average beauty.
Let's have a meal together.
Oh, Prosecutor Jo, you're here.
It's been a long time.
I'll introduce Prosecutor Jo.
You should know President Choe right?
It's been a long time, Prosecutor.
Yes, it's been quite a while.
I think I shouldn't be here today
in this situation, maybe next time.
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?
Hyeong, do you know this is not right?
That brat is a suspect of my case. A suspect!
Did you not see the news?
Yes. I've already heard it.
You seemed to have misunderstood.
I'm here to solve your contradictions.
I know.
Hyeong, let's have a drink 
together next time okay?
I'm leaving.
Hey! How can you do this?
Whenever you stir up trouble,
who is it who chases after sunbaes
(sunbae - senior/mentor)
to help you to clean up the mess?
It was me!
Beom Seok isn't like that, he's very good.
Have you forgotten everything?
Only you're like this,
how do you become a
Chief Prosecutor in the future?
Leave, leave, you brat!
Rotten fellow!
You can just remain at that
position your entire lifetime!
Okay, I know, I know...
I'll have a drink.
Will that do?
Brat,
how have you been?
How about your younger siblings?
They're dead, why?
I still have things to tell you,
that I haven't been able to put down.
I didn't expect us to be fated to meet again.
Yes, we're really fated.
Prosecutor, you said that you
already know everything.
So I'll just say some more.
That person by the name of Gim Pan Ho 
who abused Ho Sang Sik,
it's Gim Pan Ho right?
I have no contact with him.
I heard that he's built isn't small either.
All these things,
we know very well ourselves.
What are you doing? 
His cup is already empty.
Aigoo, I didn't realize that.
Prosecutor, why did you come over too?
Aigoo, your back is really firm and steady,
and your muscles are all tight.
Are you under a lot of pressure lately?
I'm just following the atmosphere.
You dare to use your dirty hands to
touch a Prosecutor? You bastard!
You dare to use your dirty hands to
touch a Prosecutor? You bastard!
Hey!
Brat,
don't get me wrong,
I'm not concerned whether
or not you're a gangster.
If I say you're a gangster,
that means you are!
Go in and put on a good
performance, bastard.
Don't dampen my spirits.
There was actually that kind of incident,
President Choe, you've suffered.
However,
at this kind of time, 
it's also not suitable for me
to come forth and say anything.
Anyway... I'll find out a little about it.
Don't be too worried,
what can possibly happen?
With what you said,
I feel much better.
Yes, yes... goodbye.
Bastard,
just wait and see.
Yes, right.
What about the other matters?
Bastard.
Okay, I know. I'll contact you again next time.
Contact me again if there is anything.
Get him!
Get him!
The arrest is completed.
Go down now.
Go back, there's nothing wrong.
Father!
Husband!
- Father.
- Husband...
Sit down.
The both of you should be very
familiar with one another right?
Greet each other.
You bastard!
It's all because of you!
Damn it!
- I was actually cheated by a brat like you!
- Enough.
- Bring him out.
- Yes.
- Be honest.
- Quickly get out!
- Bastard!
- Is this fellow crazy?
It hurts, annoying...
Aigoo, he's a old gangster.
Hey gangster! No, I
shouldn't call you a gangster.
It's said that people like you are
called "half-moons". Is that right?
You're not a gangster and
you're not an ordinary citizen,
what exactly are you?
What else can I be?
I'm just an ordinary person.
Once I treat you slightly more politely, you
start to rebel and can even talk back, bastard.
Do I look like I'm joking with you now?
I'm sorry.
You're also considered to be a smart
person. You should be very clear, right?
Do you want to be sentenced for 15
years for committing crimes in a gang?
Or do you want to be sentenced for
3 years for just using violence?
Mr. Choe Ik Hyeon,
I...
can guarantee you
that I'll let you out after 3 years.
It's not bad, right?
Why?
You're not willing?
So you'll rather receive a
sentence of 15 years directly?
No, that's not what I meant.
Your suggestion is not bad.
Not bad, okay.
Okay.
But, please pardon my disrespectfulness.
I'll like to boldly give a
suggestion to Prosecutor Sir,
I wonder if that's all right?
Of course it's beneficial to both of us.
Tell me.
Hey kid,
after you go to the United States,
you must be diligent,
do you understand?
What did father tell you?
English is power.
Very good.
In the future, if you learn English well,
you'll always be 1st. Do you understand?
Eat more.
Hyeongnim.
Our hyeongnim wants to see you.
I'm currently having a meal with my family,
tell him to meet another time.
Be careful not to make a fool of
yourself infront of the children,
and come with us obediently.
You bastard! How dare you
behave atrociously here?
Enough, stop it!
- Let me go!
- Calm down.
Everyone calm down!
I understand, let's go.
Let's talk outside.
You've been busy recently, right?
I know all that you've done.
You plan to communicate
secretly with the Prosecutor,
and wish to get me arrested,
right?
What are you talking about?
I was also arrested by them
and taken for investigation,
I was just released yesterday.
Bastard, you betray people wherever you go.
Do you believe I'll make you a handicap now?
Hyeong Bae,
listen to me,
you should also know
that the search this time
was personally instructed by the President.
Furthermore, why would I betray you?
You still want to make excuses?
Think about it, if I am secretly
communicating with them,
why was Pan Ho arrested?
Think about it carefully.
Hyeong Bae...
Let's get along well together, okay?
Let the both of us live well together, okay?
Such bad luck.
It is really because I wanted to facilitate
a good relationship with the Prosecutor
that's why I pretended to be helping them.
Now, having time on hand is the most important.
As you've seen the past 2 days,
I also do not have much luck.
The Prosecutor has the most power.
So,
what do you plan to do next?
I'm currently preparing
to go to the United States.
I have also sold the house.
You also should bare with it for
a while and find a place to hide.
Although the search is still on,
but I'll try my best to help you ask around.
In the case if
you're fooling around with me again...
When the time comes,
don't blame me for not being polite.
Go and prepare well.
When the time comes, I will contact you.
How's the luggage packing coming along?
It's almost done.
Hello?
=Big father, it's me.=
Oh Hyeong Bae, it's you.
=How is it? Are you done preparing that?=
Of course, it's all ready.
=Then,=
=I'll send a car to your house now.=
=Take that car to my place=
=for us to meet and discuss.=
Oh, okay, I understand.
But that...
What should I do now?
He wants me to go over.
1st let me look at what you've prepared.
I've brought it all.
Let's go.
Big father,
do you feel that you've stood in my spotlight?
If that's the case...
Then why do you have that
kind of revolting manner?
I clearly warned you before
not to enter my world.
Yes, right.
You did say that before.
Then,
I would like to ask you 1 sentence too.
Until now, I feel that because of you,
I have used my greatest effort.
But to you, did all these
not help you even a bit?
Of course I've gotten many benefits.
But how can you treat me like that in the end?
It was you who ganged up with Pan Ho 
that bastard first, wasn't it?
At that time I also told you very
clearly that there was no such thing.
I am also not a fool!
Why would I betray my
family for personal benefits?
That wasn't what I meant. What I meant
was that you didn't stand by my side in the end,
and instead deflected to Pan Ho's side
and made me lost reputation.
Was it not like that?
Anyway,
big father and I will severe all ties.
I reckon you should be able
to take good care of yourself.
After settling all the recent matters,
find a good place and live in comfort.
Get out of the way.
Just give in to them.
Yes, hyeongnim.
- What is this?
- This is crazy.
We're blocked on both sides,
what should we do now?
- Stay there and await orders.
- Quick get out of the way.
What's wrong with these
people? Are they crazy?
Wait!
You dog bastard...
Move out!
Bastard!
Son-of-a-bitch!
I'm going to kill you!
Come over here, bastard!
You bastard!
Little bastard!
I'm also not easy to provoke.
Bastard.
Nice...
Nice...
Nice...
He's a really incredible Prosecutor.
From the point of view of a Busan resident,
having this kind of friend can make your
life better. Of course I'm more than grateful.
But from a country's point of view,
it's simply a waste of talent.
If you can let him assist you,
you'll surely be satisfied.
He will be very beneficial towards you.
Prosecutor Sir, you've finally come.
Prosecutor Jo, you're here.
Come and pay your respects.
Prosecutor of the Seoul Prosecutor's
Office headquarters.
Congratulations.
That's him. I heard that he
is the most outstanding this year.
He is from Gyeonggi.
Oh... is it?
If it's this kind of achievement,
he should have gone to a law firm or the court.
Being a Prosecutor doesn't have much meaning.
Anyway, he's an interesting fellow.
Exactly.
Aigoo, our Prosecutor Choe is here.
We're here.
You've all come.
Yes.
I've been to your shop last time.
You have?
Then how come you didn't give me a phone call?
You seemed so busy so I
didn't want to trouble you.
This is...
Prosecutor Choe who is under
commands from Seoul.
Why don't you greet each other.
- Where's your father?
- He's over there.
- Okay, I understand.
- Let's go.
Let's go and greet him.
Oh hyeongnim, you're here.
Oh, you're here?
Yes.
This is President Pak of Myeong Jin constructions, 
whom I mentioned to you about last time.
Your name is widely known,
I'll count on your advice in the future.
You need not be like this. Instead, it should
be I who should count on you for advice.
Then, I shall announce that
Jun Sik's 1st year banquet
will now begin!
Today is Jun Sik's 1 year old birthday!
Did Jun Sik sleep well last night?
- Did he sleep well?
- Yes.
Really?
So you let him sleep really early? Then
what did the both of you do after that?
I can see that the both of you look very tired.
Are the both of you very tired?
What exactly did the both of you do after
letting the child sleep? Both of you are blushing.
Have a smoke.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.
Let me think carefully,
our Jun Sik is really a luck bringer.
Those things that I could not stop worrying about
were all solved in one go.
Your father, I,
had everything proceeding
smoothly ever since you left.
Let me see...
You're handsome.
Father,
thank you,
for always waiting for me.
Father.
Big father.
