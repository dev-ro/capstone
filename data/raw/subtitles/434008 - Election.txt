Between Lok and Big D, I prefer Big D
We know how Big D is
Kids, us adults need to talk
Not that Lok is bad
But he still has to prove himself
Lok cares for the Brothers
He's always been there
ready to help out
When Brother Kwai died in Cambodia
Lok sent back the body
and organized a nice funeral
He gets along with other brothers
That's not enough
My business requires a strong leader
Tsuen Wan's a different picture
Big D has shown
what he's capable of
All my people support Lok
Police!
No phone calls! ID!
You're suspected of Triad activities
How is this Triad activity?
Women playing mah-jong
And kids playing games
My card
Mr Soo?
Sparky, Dead Dog, Double East, Ice
and Fat Wah!
Arrest them
Yes, sir!
Get up!
You don't have a thing on us
This is a family gathering
- You have a job to do.
- Yes.
- I demand hoods.
- OK.
- Big D
- Brother D
Fish Head, here's 200K
Tell Uncle Cocky to vote for me
Such confidence!
No wonder everyone is impressed
Can I get a piece
of the action?
Wait until I'm elected
Sworn brothers should help each other
I never forget how people treat me
I'll make sure Uncle Cocky votes for you
I wish
I could run for Chairman
You can buy the title
with cash
Stop selling white powder!
Sell washing powder, yeast
rice powder
Or fish balls!
People from your hometown make
good fish balls!
$15 a bowl. It's good business!
What's so funny?
Eat your food!
Is it good?
Eat the spoon too!
Big D, don't pick on him
I'm just joking!
Who's dumb enough to eat a spoon?
You obey orders like a dog
I'm leaving
Don't mess with him
You're upset?
Wait until you're somebody
Sun Society
took control of Wu Song Street
9555 just crossed the border
9555, deliver the chicken
to the client first
OK
Frozen chickens
I smuggle
a truckload a day
Bird flu
won't stop my business
Try some
We lost two of our nightclubs
to Lum Society
Wo Sing Society
has to take action
If I'm elected
I'll expand our turf to Tsim Sha Tsui
Ask Uncle Fat to support me
He's in China
There's a roadblock on the highway!
That truck carries dope too.
Take a detour
Tell him to help me
Uncle Fat makes his own decisions
9555, take a detour
Forget the chickens
Got it
Tell the clients there's a delay
Big D's turf
is my outlet for dope
I see
Wo Sing's members have just been
released on bail
That should calm them down
They should all be shot dead
You chop off one Triad arm
and a new one sprouts in its place
All we ask for is balance of power
Peace and prosperity
The Triad is democratic
It elects its Chairman
Sun Society has a simpler solution:
Power passes from father to son
The Triad election is a tradition over
100 years old
Keep a close eye on Wo Shing
200K
Screw Big D...
I lost his bribe money
on the soccer game
Manchester United... Fuckin' team
I got screwed
Their goddamn goalkeeper sucked
Boss, sober up
I am sober
Is it day or night now?
Here, 200K
Thanks
Good business
The new girls look great
Uncle Long Gun
Boss
Where's the money?
Big D wants your vote
Jimmy
is that girl for real?
Go get her
100K?
That's all from Big D
Jump
Faster
Jump faster!
Faster!
Screw Big D! He gave Uncle Cocky
200K, and me 100K?
I won't support him!
Are you coming?
Stop the gambling
before you lose everything!
Lok respects the elders most
Last time
he paid my bail money out of
his own pocket
He asked Sparky to set up that meeting
He got me arrested in the first place!
The current Chairman, Whistle
comes from Wan Chai
We need some new blood
Lok is our man
How about Big D?
He knows how to make a dime
His people are troublemakers!
When they beat up
Uncle Cripple
he said nothing
He lacks respect!
Do you expect our type
to be polite?
It's Cripple's fault
He didn't identify himself!
Not Big D's fault
I'm voting for him. How about you?
Still thinking
Damn!
How about you?
They're both good
Nonsense!
Big D
Wah?
Big D
Still thinking?
Well
Lok is loyal.
He plans to expand our turf.
Everyone claims
to be loyal to the Society!
And expansion
is easier said than done!
How much
did Big D bribe you with?
What did you say?
You know what I said
Screw you!
What?
Tea's ready
Tea's ready
Watch it!
Just kidding
Haven't you finished yet?
He's getting old
Your last suit was too tight
Gold buttons
Just a moment
Make sure
you use the best fabrics
I need this for tomorrow
40 tables
Let's go
And I want the biggest ballroom
Or I'll go
to another restaurant
- Uncle Ming.
- Lok
Two pounds of best rib
Alright
My son loves it
When I was young
the Uncles got to elect the Chairman
I thought
they were very old
I wondered why it had to be that way
Later, I realized it was their seniority
Whatever they said carried weight
Getting a little money
is fine
But if bribery corrupts this election
we're better off auctioning the seat!
Without credibility, we are nothing!
Big D is the best candidate
The best to serve us!
I've made my point
This Society needs harmony
Not a one-man show
I'm voting for Lok
Lok, you've been elected
Congratulations!
Thank you, Uncle Monk
Uncle Teng wants to see you tomorrow
Alright
Son, let's eat! Get me a beer!
Big D doesn't like people talking
behind his back
Understood
Show my office the bill
Here are the tips
Thank you, Madam
Please come again
Sure
Goodbye, Madam
Who is it?
It's Long Hair, Uncle Long Gun
What is it?
Big D wants to see you
Finish pissing first
Brother Sam
Big D wants to see you
Finish your banana first
In ancient times
before telecommunications
the Chairman could remain unknown
to the brothers of his own Triad
and not be identified
The Dragon Head Baton helped
the Chairman to be recognized
Now, with progress
it represents the Chairman's authority
When I was given the Baton
it was a real fanfare
When I was elected in 1970
a lavish ceremony
was held for all the brothers
Even police detectives were invited
My predecessor was a messy guy
We had to clean the Baton
with insecticide
It caused a lot of trouble
This Baton is over 100 years old
It has been handed down to dozens
of Chairmen
Losing it would mean losing face
for the Society
Whatever happens, be careful
in the next 2 years
I understand, Uncle Teng
Tell Whistle to turn over the Baton
Whistle! It's Big D
Tell Uncle Teng you won't hand over
the Baton
that you don't support Lok!
We'll get into real trouble!
Then trouble it is!
I'm in trouble already!
It must be handed over
Do as I say! I repeat:
Tell Uncle Teng you don't support Lok
and won't give him the Baton
Then bring the Baton to me!
- Big D.
- That's all
Go get them!
Go get them!
Ice, it's Big D
See you at the restaurant at 8
We'll talk tonight
Double East, it's Big D
See you at 8
We need to talk
Uncle Teng, it's Whistle
What is it?
What is it?
I don't support Lok
He won't get the Baton
Something wrong with your head?
Call me when you're sober
I'll wait here
Don't try anything
Sparky
- Lok, this is Jimmy.
- Lok
Big D, it's Lok
Wait!
Go get them!
How can I help?
I heard you kidnapped
Uncle Long Gun and Sonny
Right!
We're brothers. Uncle Long Gun is old
Let's talk
What's it to you?
I'm just trying to end the dispute
You're supposed to be the Chairman
But talk to me when you have the Baton!
Talk to me when you have the Baton!
Go away. The Uncles'll take care of it
Then what?
I'll find him myself
Jimmy!
I said the Uncles'll take care of it
Don't cause trouble
I'm going to Lantau Island
Yes, Boss
I have to lay low for a while
Go to China and get the Baton
Wait for my call
Yes, Boss
Long Gun!
8 o'clock, at the restaurant
Big D said...you know what he wants
The Baton belongs to the Society
Whistle must hand it over
There's nothing we can do!
What if the Baton is lost?
Uncle Teng, we have to bend the rules
this time
You're on Big D's side
I want to end the dispute
You're helping Big D
Don't insult me!
Why not?
We had an election
We can't annul it because
someone's unhappy
Tell Big D the result is final
We can't risk
losing the Baton
I'm just going by the rules
Those who play games
should watch out
Uncle Monk, look for Whistle
Tell Lok he is the new Chairman
Yes, Uncle Teng
Moron! My tire!
Superintendent Hui
What's the occasion?
I'm arresting you before there's trouble
Hardly surprising
Screw you! My tire!
- Screw you!
- Go to hell!
Freeze!
You're suspected of Triad activities
Freeze!
Can I call my maid
and ask her to pick up the dog?
Go to the station first
Don't worry, we don't detain animals
Police!
Lam Lok, you're suspected
of Triad activities
I'll go with you
Do you need to cuff me?
Cuff him!
Big D deserved to win
I'll face up to my responsibilities
Finished? Where's the Baton?
In China
Where?
Guangzhou
You had 8 hours to go and come back
That was long enough to get it
I couldn't cross the border because
I was on bail
You did last week!
Forget the Baton
Do you want me dead?
Don't cause trouble
It's against tradition
Screw tradition!
Last time
the Uncles talked me out of running
Now you talk about tradition?
Wo Sing Chairman?
You're nobody
Without my money
you wouldn't have won!
Did you forget all that?
I always helped you!
Stop...
Big D...
How much did you lose
on my casino boat?
- Stop...
- Tell me!
We're brothers!
Big D...
Are you Big D?
You should be punished!
Big D!
What?
Who do you think you are?
You're suspected of Triad activities
On what grounds?
Put it on!
I've nothing to hide!
Suspects request no hoods
Yes, sir!
- Go!
- Don't push me!
I'll kill you!
Stop pushing me!
Kneel down!
Look here
They're Wo Sing's senior members!
They're all bosses!
Recognize them?
Ex-Chairman Whistle
Uncle Double East
Ice
And this one...Big D
He's really something!
Take your pictures!
Take your pictures!
You'll be my witness
for police brutality!
Take your pictures!
Enough pictures!
That's enough!
Screw you!
Suspect on the run!
Suspect on the run!
Take your pictures!
Justice served!
Brother Lok
Sit
They don't have a case
You'll be released after 48 hours
Tell Sparky to find the Baton
Understood
All this is unimportant
Police is too nosy
They just want to stop us from fighting
Kill whoever has the Baton
I'll pay anything
Understood
A certain Four Eye works for Whistle
He has the Baton in China
Lok's sending men to get it
What do I care?
Whistle's your friend
You'll lose face
Damn that Whistle!
Do you know Four Eye?
You mean Whistle's driver?
We grew up together
I'll call friends in China for help
Do you have papers
to cross the border?
Big D knows you have connections
in China
I won't touch the Baton
If you refuse, Big D
won't sell your drugs
Here's your payment
Put the price up to $20
You sell it at $60 a pill
Give us a break
Big D agrees to $19 a pill
Kun, you're in charge
Get the job done
Yes, boss
GUANGZHOU, CHINA
Brother Tung, thank you so much
Brother Soo
I found your guy and the Baton for you
Thank you, Brother Tung
Big D said he'll pay anything
for the Baton
His people are coming
Well, now
How's your wife?
Remember how I helped her
to give birth in Hong Kong?
How's your son?
Planning on finding him school
in Hong Kong?
He has Hong Kong citizenship
I'll let you go this time
Four Eye is not talking
You ask him where the Baton is
Four Eye, are you alright?
Hang in there!
Our people have decided
to support Lok
Turn over the Baton
so Whistle can stay out of trouble
You can keep the Baton for now
Let's go back to Hong Kong together
Look at the state you're in.
Is it worth it?
Have Whistle call me!
Whistle was hit by a car last night
He's probably not going to make it
Loyalty aside, you should think
of yourself!
The Baton shall perish with Whistle
Damn!
Surround the house!
Follow me
I'm going to check the back
Leave with the Baton!
Will you protect the Baton?
If I ever embezzle anything
from my brothers
I will be killed by 10,000 knives
Freeze!
Don't shoot!
I'm a Hong Kong citizen!
On the ground! Don't move!
Mr Soo
Get up
Captain, we're pursuing
the other suspect
Good
Take him to the car
Yes, sir
Everybody out
Bring him clothes!
Yes!
Get up
Long time no see
It's been a while
Last time we met, you were a gangster
So now you're a police captain
Before 1997
I was sent to infiltrate the Triads
And I treated you as a brother
I spent plenty of time
to get you off the charges
If you want my help
you better cooperate
I heard Wo Sing Society has a Baton
but I never saw it
Did your friend Big Head take it?
What?
I'm here
because a friend was kidnapped
and you arrest me?
I didn't break any law
I decide who breaks the law
Come out!
Tsui Tin
Teng Wai
Come out!
Sir
Sit
We won't talk without our lawyer
Sit down, Teng
Hong Kong has over 20 Triads
There are many people like you
The Triads are impossible to eliminate
I'm here to fight them
I'll destroy whoever causes trouble
I'll crush them
I don't care if you support Lok or Big D
I want a truce
I don't want infighting
Neither do we
You talk to Lok. You talk to Big D
Sort it out
Yes, sir!
The sooner you do, the sooner
you can leave
Uncle Cocky
Uncle Monk
Don't take any action
Uncle Cocky is talking to Big D
I hope he listens
Big D
Big D!
What?
Stop causing trouble!
Why should I?
It's your fault the Baton's missing!
Don't blame me!
Whistle's men want revenge
Tough!
No one will support you!
What about my money?
What about my money?
My business? My clients?
Uncle Teng promises you'll be
next Chairman
He promises!
He might do the dirty on me!
What if you're all dead then?
If you carry on, war is imminent
We'll be out of business!
We won't support you!
Fine!
I don't need your support!
I'll do it myself!
"The New Wo Sing!"
Are you crazy?
Sir, open the door!
New Wo Sing Society?
What do you think?
War is imminent
Are you playing games?
My brothers won't allow a breakaway
It'd mean the end of their business
What business?
It's up to us to decide
The police decide
who can do business!
My brothers will be out of jobs
Then, what?
Then, we'll arrest you all
Wo Sing has 50,000 members
The other Triads have 300,000
Without rules and order
Can Hong Kong's prisons hold that
many people?
I've been a Triad member all my life
We have traditions to follow
Take him back to his cell
Yes, sir
Sir, I want to see Big D
I want to hear it with my own ears
Uncle Cocky is old. He might have
misunderstood you
Uncle Teng, I ran for Chairman
in good faith
to serve the Triad with all my heart
I did everything to please everyone
I spent lots of money
If it weren't for that bastard Long Gun
I would've won!
Did you say you want to start
a new Society?
I'm better than Lok!
Wo Sing deserves the right leader
I'm asking
if you intend to start a new Society
I want the common good
but if no one supports me
then I'll have to do it myself
Understood
So, war is imminent
Open the door!
I have no choice!
You want me dead!
No one will allow Wo Sing to break up
Our brothers will fight you
Then, let's fight!
Let's see who dies first!
Hear me? I'm nearing the border
My license plate is ZFV18
Thanks, Lieutenant. See you soon
This road is safer
Too many cops on the highway
I need to piss!
Is it much further?
Give me the Baton
What will I say to my boss?
I have nothing against you
Give it
If I rob a brother
I shall be killed by five thunderbolts
Starting a new Triad would destroy us!
Traitor!
He's betraying the tradition!
What does Lok want?
Let's fight Big D
My people are ready
Lok wants
to find the Baton first
I'm just doing my job
If I steal from a brother
I shall be killed
If I betray the trust of my brothers
I'll be killed by 10,000 knives
Big Head found the Baton
The police are after him
I know someone in China who can help
Can he be trusted?
Don't worry. He's trustworthy
Call Big Head
Give it
Kun, what's the situation?
I'll get it. I'm nearly there
A guy called Kun
is coming to help you
Who?
Kun
Find the Baton for Lok!
What do you mean?
Big D is starting a new Society!
Are you Kun?
OK, boss
Is that it?
No one will fight Big D?
Let's see who finds the Baton first
I will never embezzle property
from my brothers
If I do so, I will be killed
by 10,000 knives
I'm sorry
Boss, it's Kun. I'm at the border
Deliver the Baton to Sparky
Understood
Turn off your engine. ID, please
Stop!
Boss, there's a problem:
I ran down a cop
Shit!
Sparky will send someone to help you
Where are you?
Near Fanling
but I'm being tailed
Hang on
Do you know Jet?
Sure. He deals coke for Fish Head
Your license number?
JE4206
He'll meet you at Shatin
OK
Now what?
"I want to see the Anti-Triad Unit"
I want to see my wife
You're on Special Watch. I've got orders
No visits
My lawyer!
When we have time
I want my lawyer now!
Whistle wants to talk
The police prolonged your detention
I'm worried about your business
Finish him
He's in custody
Finish him
I can't promise
I'm going back
Finish him
Whistle is close to Big D
His confession will be damaging
Big D is in trouble
Tell Sparky to take action
Then, go see Whistle
He'll talk to the Society's lawyer
I'm leaving
Guard!
I have Sparky. Give me the Baton
Give it!
My delivery is for Sparky only!
I work for the Society
Whoever comes closer dies!
Take him!
I work for the Society
Get in!
Emergency Services? Someone's hurt
Send an ambulance
to Hung To Road
Uncle Teng was released
He wants you to call him
Give me the phone
How's Whistle?
The lawyer's on his way
And the Baton?
Jimmy has it
He wants to see you
He's not giving in
Uncle Teng, it's Lok
Just got out
If I can't convince Big D, it'll be war
Sorry about your son
Lok wants to do Big D a favor
"I won't talk"
You'll be asked questions
You're badly hurt
Why keep your family worried?
Lok doesn't want you to bring down
the Society
Your help
will guarantee your family's safety
What?
Thank you sir
We'll take action tomorrow
- Call sick ward!
- Yes
You authorized the visit?
It was Lok's lawyer
Doctor didn't object
I said, no outside contact!
Thanks
Whistle pulled out his tubes
Sorry, Sir
Sorry, Sir
Tou, you're in charge from now on!
Yes, sir!
Why?
To pay back my boss and Long Gun?
I'm doing it on Big D's behalf
The Uncles will pay for them
to get better
or look after them for life
I can't leave it like that
If you refuse, I'll be threatened
Jimmy, give me the Baton
I'll make sure you get promoted
for your help
If you don't give me the Baton
you'll be
the Society's mortal enemy
Why do you think I had Whistle killed?
To save our business
Times have changed
Business is everything now
Crooks need to learn to use their brains
I'll be Chairman for 2 years
Show me respect
Do what you like after my term
Help me
I have money
I'll remember this
Thank you
Brother Lok, they're here
Thank you all for coming
Sorry
He did it for the Society
Let it go
Brother Lok, Jet
Kun, Mr. Soo, Big Head
Brother Lok
First time I've seen it
The Uncles won't forget you
I won't forget you
From now on, you're my godsons
You'll be under my protection
Godfather
Call me and I'll come running
Thank you
Godfather
Godfather
I should ask my boss first
I'll talk to him
Godfather
Jimmy?
You have everyone's support
It's a win-win deal
Godfather
Makes me feel younger!
Work hard
You may become Chairman
Not me, that's for sure
Kun's the best shot
He killed a cop!
I'll help you to hide
No need
If I can't beat the charges
I'd rather accept them
I'll turn myself in
Get him the best lawyer
OK
Your wife's outside
She sent me
We should talk
Get in my car
If you don't, there'll be war
I have the Baton
Keep an eye on the boss
Tsim Sha Tsui has 600 restaurants
about 30 karaoke joints
20 nightclubs
100 bars
over 50 saunas, video arcades
pool halls
Every month, the protection money
is 10 million dollars
Then there are dope joints
valet parking
Think I don't know the figures?
I know!
And it's too much for one person!
Get to the point!
Wo Sing could take over the turf
I reached an agreement with everyone
but you
Why should I go along with it?
I'll continue Whistle's policy
As Chairman
I'll protect your business
and you keep the profits
As for new businesses
we'll split everything 50-50
I'll support you at the next election
If you start a new Society
I'll fight you
with all my strength
There'll be one coffin for you
One for me
You can carry on with me
or get out here
300 years ago, the Manchurian Empire
exterminated
patriotic Shaolin monks
5 survivors got away
joined forces, swore to be brothers
to restore the Ming Empire
Known as the "Five Ancestors"
they created the Hung Society
It conducted heroic uprisings
Thousands of patriots valiantly died
in battle
The Hung continued to exist
as a secret society
Commence the ceremony!
You are entering the Hung army fortress
Any disobedience
is punishable by death
I am Emperor Ming's general
I build bridges and roads
I cross mountains and ramparts
Who doesn't recognize a Brother?
What do you want?
I come to enlist
- Why?
- To restore the Ming
- What's your proof?
- A poem
Arms are unleashed
The Manchurians occupy our land
The hour of loyalty and restoration
is at hand
Do you love gold or your brethren?
My brethren
Do you love gold or your brethren?
My brethren
First oath. Once a Hung Brethren
I shall treat the parents of my brethren
as my own
First oath. Once a Hung Brethren
I shall treat the parents of my brethren
as my own
I shall treat the relatives
of my brethren as my own
If I do not keep this oath
I shall be struck down by 5 thunderbolts
Second oath
I shall assist my brethren
to bury their parents
by offering financial assistance
or physical assistance if I am poor
If I do not
I shall be struck down
On the 7th day of the 10th moon
of Yi Xi Year
we nine brothers kneel before the altar
of the gods
to make a pledge like
the Five Ancestors
We will form a league of brethren
We nine leaders unite in fraternity
in the name of Heaven, Earth
and the Mings
We nine brothers
With one heart, and in honor
all united in life and in death
Born apart, we will die together
We pledge allegiance to
Wo Sing Society
We pledge to look out for
each other's wellbeing
Loyalty shall lead to prosperity
Traitors, renegades
and those of no honor shall be
killed by 3 knives and 5 thunderbolts
mercilessly pursued and cursed
by the gods
End of ceremony!
Honor shall bring prosperity
Those of no honor...
will be broken
The God of War is our witness
Our sabers
united as 9 brothers
We shall no longer fight
If one of us is in danger
the rest shall go to his rescue
We shall conquer Tsim Sha Tsui!
I, Lok, shall be the first to fight
I shall be the first to offer money
Nothing will stop me
I will scare the enemy away
I shall fight on the front line
May my brothers prosper!
May the gods protect us!
May the gods keep us!
Keep a lookout
How refreshing, Big D
This is a negotiation
Where are your men?
You're wrong, Brother Dino
We've been friends for so long
You saved my life once
I remember
Why come on my turf?
Uncles' orders
I couldn't refuse
What is Lok up to?
He won't negotiate
He refuses a 50/50 split
I want him dead
I hate him as much as you do
but what can I do?
He beat me at the election
My hands are tied
Let's take him down together
But we took an oath together
This is the modern age
You're too old-fashioned
50/50 on protection money
Park further away
Wait till Lok shows up
OK
Brother Lok? It's Big D
I need a word
Your men are trapped
I called the cops
You're too naive to be a gangster!
You're a disgrace!
Use your head!
Police! Freeze!
Damn!
Long Hair, clean up the place!
Look at that!
The view of Tsim Sha Tsui at night
is really something!
It's as if I'm looking at piles of cash!
Amazing!
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you!
I couldn't have done it alone
You hypocrite!
Let's make money together!
Thanks, Jimmy, you're a good kid
After 20 years in the Triad
your boss and I call ourselves
"brothers" and "uncles"
but we're nothing
We're only good for
gambling and drinking
And now... look what I've become
Jimmy, if you stay in the Triad
make sure you get absolute power
Otherwise, leave now
Damn fish! Come and die!
Know the secret to fishing?
What?
Patience!
Damn
We'll see who catches more
Daddy has four fish. I caught two
Auntie caught one
Uncle has none
What's up with my bait?
Goddam fish are blind!
Don't curse in front of the kid!
Doesn't bother me
These fish are blind!
I kept being woken up by the phone
all night
Heard what happened
to Tung Society's Chairman?
Yes
Danny, I need to go
Be my lookout
Heart attack
Poor man. Out of the blue
But Tung Society has two chairmen
One can replace the other
What are you trying to say?
I was thinking
Wo Sing could have more than
one chairman
Most other Societies have two
or even four
In short
when one's in trouble, another can lead
Two chairmen also increase earnings
Wo Sing will become more powerful
It is an old tradition
It'd be hard to persuade the Uncles
Let's persuade them together!
Another catch?
Support me
Will you support me?
Sure
Let's see Uncle Teng tomorrow!
Damn! Why can't I catch a single fish?
I'll throw them a grenade!
I'll throw them a grenade!
Go to the car!
Let's go home
