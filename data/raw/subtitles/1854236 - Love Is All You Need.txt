We will call you back for a
check up in about three months.
Only then will we be able to tell if you
are healthy or cancer free.
We also have some groups
you can meet with who
have been through a
similar situation as you.
That's not for me.
- However, now you know about them.
- Yes.
And finally I want you to consider
if you want breast reconstruction.
Nah, I couldn't do that.
- And your husband doesn't mind?
- Leif? Yes, I believe so.
I think Leif likes me, as I am.
Well, as long as I make lemon mousse
for him once a week.
He values what's inside the highest.
I don't even think he's
discovered that one is missing.
Many choose to travel...
if they can afford it.
We are leaving next week.
- My daughter is getting married in Italy.
- Great.
- Yes, some have those means.
- Yes.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED
- How long do you stay here anyway?
- Only in the summer.
We should have stayed here,
but then mother died.
Villa.
I see it.
Here is the key…..
- Wine and meat.


Come Yes, yes...
Well...
It's so beautiful.
It's wildly romantic.
There is not a single piece
of furniture, Astrid.
- We could sit on the floor.
- No.
There is nothing here.
Would you look around.
Where were the lights?
- There's also no power.
- Furniture.
There is a sofa and an armchair
and everything else.
I knew father didn't use the house...
but I figured he at least
took care of it. This is a joke.
It's called rustic, and it's perfect.
Astrid, hold on... Astrid!
This is a stupid idea.
We have to find a hotel.
What are you talking about, honey?
Patrick, it's the world's best idea.
We'll get there.
Right?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

At a seminar.
Weren't you told?



Congratulations!


- Dear Phillip.
- Today it is Phillip's.

Can I just get a word? Thank you. I just
want to say congratulations, Phillip.
And we would like to tell you how
happy we are that you're our boss.
But we are also concerned because we
believe that you work too much.
So we decided to give you
a kind of leisure gift.
Here you go.
You get to skydive.
Thank you.
We believe you should get out.
That you take the plunge into...
life.

I would also like to take this opportunity
to thank your sister Benedikte.
For without you we would not have
known it was Phillip's birthday.
- Should we give Patricia a hand?
- You shouldn't.

I would like to give you
something more personal.
It is also a gift,
where you can get a little more out...
with me.
- It's tango-shoes.
I dance every Thursday.











Leif? Are you home, sweety?
I have a surprise for you.
Leif?
- Weren't you out for chemo?
- No, I'm done with chemo.
I've just had a few
additional blood tests taken.
We have a lunch break.
Well, it's over now.
Who is she?
It's just Tilde from accounting.
We were lying around and...
With Tilde from accounting
while I'm in the hospital? Were you?
Yes.
Just get a taxi, Tilde.
Remember to get the receipt.
- I see now that it was a mistake.
- How could you?
Why now? Since I'm healthy
we can enjoy everything.
I don't get it.
How long have you been seeing her?
- She's been with us for 2 1/2 years.
- She doesn't look that old.
She's older than you think.
She's gone to CBS.
She doesn't even look older than Astrid.
Age has nothing to do with anything today.
She can't be completely normal,
when she chooses someone like you.
I understand you're upset.
But there's no need for unpleasantries.
- Oh, you don't think so?
- No.
You're on my mother's leather sofa, while
I'm fighting for my life in the hospital.
You just said that you were healthy.
I don't know that Leif. They have to
check it all the time. Check, check.
Also, it's not your mother's sofa.
It's from
my Uncle Esben who had
it with him in Malaga.
- Do you even care?
- What?
No. I think we should take it
easy. You're overreacting.
- What are you talking about?
- It's been a difficult time for both us.
It's actually been difficult for me
seeing you be so sick.
It's been hard to see you
have it, like you did.
See you in Italy.
23 years, and then he leaves her that way!
- What a bastard?
- Yes.
We should get a few bikers
to teach him a lesson.
And now his daughter is getting married.
What an idiot.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
They have only known each other for three
months, but Patrick is so nice.
I think he's studying
to become a politician.
He's getting his Masters degree.
Of course, the wedding is in Italy,
where the family has a lemon orchard.
Let me get that hairspray.
Did Leif ever do that
terrace he promised you?
No.
What a lazy piece of crap.
And so stingy.
- At least, you got rid of him.
- He's actually been there for me.
He didn't leave me.
I'm not taking it too seriously.
Shut up, Mom. Tilde is saying
they're getting married.
People always think they know it all.
Dad is just confused.
- No, he's an ass.
- Don't talk about your father like that.
You've always defended him, and he's
always treated you like shit.
- What about Astrid?
- We should not worry about Astrid.
She has plenty to do with the wedding.
- What is it?
- Just a little candy and some books.
Mom, I'm not going to camp.
- Where did you find these?
- In a box in the basement.
Mom, it'll be fine.
I can take care of myself, ok?
It's just... you'll be away
for so long.
I don't like it.
Why can't you wait three days.
Then you could come to the wedding as well?
- They can't pause the war because of a wedding.
- They should.













- I have to catch a plane.


It's just because I've been
really unlucky here in the past.
And I am not accustomed
to travelling alone.



I have to catch my plane.
I have to go to Italy.
My daughter is getting married.



Are you Patrick's father?

Ida.

























Exciting.








Help me get these up.


































Hi, Mom!


Hey, little Mommy.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, Phillip.

- This is a nice place.
- I'll show you where you to stay.

- Where is your suitcase?
- It's still in Copenhagen.


Are you happy?
Well, we've been very busy.
- Patrick has been terrified.
- What about you?
- Yes, I'm also quite terrified.
- My little girl is getting married!
When you found my father,
how did you know it had to be him?
Were you just completely sure,
from when you met him?
I just thought he was wonderful.
- Are you unsure about this?
- I don't really know...
It's quite natural, to have doubts.
That's life.
There are no guarantees.
You're not Catholic.
You can just...
Very funny. I wonder if
you're already getting us divorced.
I'm sorry.
- It'll all be fine. Don't you think?
- Yes.
- Is Dad here?
- He won't be here until tomorrow.
- He wanted to see Pompeii.
- Well?
- Why didn't you fly in together?
- Well, you know...
Your father has become cultural.
Everything is fine.
Magazines.

















- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Patrick?
Patrick?
Patrick? I found a lot of
cute tablecloths and napkins.

- We've just been taking a break.
- We're actually very busy.
- He's here in two hours.

- We've only been here for 20 minutes.
- It's nice that you aren't stressed.
- But people'll be right there.
- Well let's...
My shoes are crushing my feet.
That's what happens when
you eat so many chips.
Salt binds the liquid. With such fat feet,
you should have found some open-toed shoes.
- Benedikte, this is my mother Ida.
- Nice to meet you.
This is Patrick's Aunt
and her daughter Alexandra.
She has 2,200 DLL in overweight,
and still no shoes she can fit.
My suitcase is gone.
I only have this.
I hate it when that happens!
It's so unprofessional.
What are we paying them for?
But your hair is very beautiful.
It's a wig.
And you have a sense of humor.

Did you travel down here
together with Philip?
Yes.
Isn't he a nice man? Couldn't you just die
from how wonderful he is?
And then it doesn't matter that he's ugly.
No, I'm kidding.
- Nah, well, now we're here anyway.
- And isn't this place wonderful?



- Cheers, Mother.
- Cheers.
- Oh, here comes Dad. Hi Dad.
- Hey, baby girl.
Uhm, isn't that the woman from accounting?
Leif, what the hell are you doing?
You can't be here with that girl!
- Would you relax.
- Relax? You're...
Drama!
- Why did she do that, sweety?
- Just find a new shirt for me, ok, honey?
My baby girl.
You look gorgeous.
What a huge box that is.
- Hi, Leif. Welcome.
- Thank you.
Thanks, honey.
You've met Tilde before, right?
Hi, sweetie. And thank you, for letting me
come on such short notice.
- Dad, could we talk for a few minutes?
- Of course. I need to change as well.
- What the hell, Dad?
- They canceled her flight.
- Tilde was a mess.
- Could you explain to
me what is happening!
- I did call to tell you she was coming.
- Just stop!
What about Mom?
I've lost four pounds because of this.
Kenneth hates me now.
And that hairdresser, Vibe, spat
at the company car last Friday.
This has also been tough mentally on me!
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- It's my father.
- Hello! Tilde Rømer, Leif's fiance.
- Hello. Tilde Rømer, Leif's fiance.
- Aunt Patricia.
- Hello. Hanne.
- Leif's fiance.
- Hello. Fiancee?
- Yes.
Why didn't you tell me you'd split up?
- We have not broken up.
- Are you crazy?
What the hell are you then? He showed up
here with that whore from accounting.
- Don't talk like that.
- Yes, Mom.
The word whore is invented for
situations like this.
Tell me what's going on, and be honest.
Yes, I apologize.
I had not imagined he would bring her.
- What a jerk.
- Yes, he is a fool.
But he's been really
confused, sad and upset.
- My illness has been hard for him.
- Will you listen to yourself!
You wouldn't understand.
And you shouldn't.
It's your wedding.
Don't your waste time on us.
It'll be nice.
I would actually prefer
if they went home again.
But he has to be here.
He's your father.
It's your wedding.
Don't worry about me.
I'll pull myself together.
Now go down to Patrick.
Run along.





Turn around.







































- Here you go.
- Shouldn't we wait for everyone?
- Nah, that's ok.
- No, we have to...







I'm leaving, if you are giving a speech.
I know it's rude to say something before
we've eaten, so I will keep it short.
As Patrick's aunt I feel it is
fitting for me to say a few words.
For those who don't know,
I've taken care of Patrick for many years.
I have been a kind of surrogate mother.
- Fake mother.
- No, now I have ...!
- I'd rather be called an auntie Mom.
- Just start with being a mother.
Then it is my duty so say that
tonight is not all about you.
Or about you, Astrid.
No, tonight it's all
about our host, Phillip.





Patrick, you have the most
wonderful father.
Astrid, you are marrying a boy...
- whose father has meant everything
to me and my daughter.
He's been there when my little
big daughter struggled with her obesity.
I was worried at night.
He was there when she cut
herself and much worse.
He was there some years ago
when I divorced my husband.
The worst divorce.
Ex-asshole, as I call him.
No, it shouldn't be about me.
It is your party.
A celebration Phillip has made possible.
It is so wonderful that you
can have your wedding here...
- where he married my sister
nearly 26 years ago?
Even back then we kept an eye on each other.
We winked at each other and flirted.
Until Elizabeth just stole you
in front of me.
Before I could count to three.
Oh my god, what I'm saying.
No, seriously.
She was a great sister.
Just a minute.
I need a couple of seconds.
I'm sorry.
Ok, I'll move on.
Patrick. It was so hard for you.
Right, sweetheart?
I'm sure she would be proud of you...
if she had seen you
here today with Astrid.
I'm proud of you, and
I'm sure Phillip is proud.
Here by I think we should say cheers
with a quote from Henry Miller:
"We can never get enough love.
And we can never give enough love."
Or as Herman Bang says:
"Indifference is love's
most painful sentiment." Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
No. No.
It doesn't matter.
It's ok, honey.
I now I believe we can sit down again.
Herman Bang? I have no idea...
Do you know who he is?
Yes, Herman Bang. Yes.
No, you don't. You're just saying
that to seem wildly clever.
- I'll do it.
- No, let me.
Let me show you.
Rub, and gently.
Very gently.
Could you please stop that?
What the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you sleeping?
Are you ok?
Nope. I just needed
some fresh air.
I believe it went really well.
Yea, except
for auntie-mother's speech...
with your father's girlfriend and what
happened to the dress. It went very well.
That's how family is.
There are always some idiots.
Yes.
- It was fun with the dress.
- Yeah.
I think it's all going to be...
absolutely fantastic.
Just go to bed, honey.
Okay.
You're allowed to have sex before you
get married. You know that, right?
How long do we continue in this
ridiculous heat? It's really annoying.
I have only one thing to say.
Spinning classes.




Do you own all the land here, Phillip?

There must be good money in this.
What is the unit price for those
little yellow bastards?
- Stop talking money all the time.
- I don't do that.
Honey, couldn't you just try to
enjoy the natural atmosphere.
Hear the birds.
They're fine.
They don't have any money.
If you don't have other dresses,
you can borrow one from me.
I have one that will fit you.
They are a little tight,
but one of them can stretch, Ida.
Then maybe you could do my hair.
That would be so nice for us to...
Tilde, great idea, but we have to find
some tablecloths and napkins...
and then a really nice
dress for you, right, Mom?
- Tilde, are you coming.
- Yes.
- Yes. So we are.
- Yes.
Wow, would you look at that.
How beautiful.
There's Phillip.
I thought they went back.
I thought so too. We have to as well.
We don't have much time.
- You head back. I'll just go say hi.
- How sweet of you, Mom.
- Maybe he wants to be left alone.
- Who would want that.
- Okay. See you at home.
- Bye.










Hello.
What will it be?



















































Yes, Hello. This is Ida Hjort speaking.
Could you patch me through to...
Could you patch me through
to the oncology department.
It is because I can feel a lump on my neck.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Haircut?
Here.
Thank you.


There they are!
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!
Kenneth, dammit!
What are you doing here?
Of course I'm here,
when you're getting married.
- What happened to your arm?
- I fell, and it hurts a lot.
- Should we get the party started?
- Mom will be so happy to see you.
There's just a little thing
you need know about Dad.
What now?
- I really should kick his ass.
- Don't do that here.
- It's your sister's party.
- But when my arm is cured, I'll give him a...
No, you won't!
- You look good.
- Oh, stop it. Let us get down there?
- Mother!
- What?
I really think you look gorgeous.
Come.


- I hear your arm is broken.
- Stay away from me.

Beautiful.
Thank you.



God, that dress is beautiful.
Absolutely wonderful.
Did you find it in the "city"?
Gorgeous place. I absolutely love it.
But they are using all
of Uncle Phillip's money.
No, it's a loan. A loan.
My credit card doesn't
allow such high amounts.
So you've borrowed money from Phillip?



Ida, here. It's a great wine
they serve here.
- You look damn good in that dress.
- Thank you, Leif. Hey, sweety.
- You look amazing.
- Just like you.
Sorry to interrupt.
But, dinner is served soon.
But before that, I would like to welcome
everyone who is here...
and say thank you, for being here.
Astrid and I are very happy
that you are all here.
Also, I would like to remind you
to not drink too much tonight...
because the real party
is not till tomorrow.
- You should have told us then.
- It's a joke. I'm kidding.
We would like to say...
I'm so nervous. I must
apologize. It's pretty stupid.
We would like to thank my Dad,
who has made this possible.
- Thank you, Phillip.
- You're welcome.

Astrid, time for you.
This morning I came to think of
the first time we met.
And that was when? A week ago?
Three months tomorrow, right?
I had only known Astrid
for about 15 minutes...
when she said she wanted to marry...
live in the country
and have six wonderful children.
Astrid just wanted to be
surrounded by love...
and fill her life and heart with love.
That, I think, is absolutely fantastic.
I actually just started my speech
for tomorrow. Not the plan.
But, Astrid, I love you.
With all my heart.
And I really hope I help
fulfill your desires.
Cheers, baby. Cheers.
Cheers.
Dinner is served.


- What?
- Come dance with me.
I don't want to dance.
Just go out there and have fun.
One single Coating,
25,000 for a room, right?
Would you get down from the couch.
Isn't she lovely.
Hey, go away!





What have you done, Alexandra?
What have you been drinking?
Come on. Two fingers in the throat.
Two fingers down your throat, sweetheart.
Mom, I feel really bad.
I've really been looking
forward to this trip.
You shouldn't even be here. But once
again your Dad didn't have time for you.
Now it's my turn to have fun, just
put two fingers down your throat.
You might as well learn, with all
that food you are eating. Come on.
Two fingers.
You'll feel much better.
Damn, how ugly you are.
- I hate you.
- Yes, yes. Me, me, me.
Could it be about your mother?
For like five minutes?
No, Alexandra! That's the most
disgusting thing, I know of.



There are many trees, right?
And many lemons.
Yes, indeed there is.
It is damn beautiful here.
It looks kind of awesome,
when they're hanging from those branches.
Have you been drinking a little?
It is totally like being on an...
"all inclusive".
It's pretty wild with your arm.
Yes.
Weren't you totally scared?
No. I've tried a little
bit of everything by now.
That's life when you're in "combat".
You never believe it'll happen to you.
I've been so lucky.
I'll be back and then you can get the
rest. Stay there and you can get the rest.
Why are you with such
an old idiot like my Dad?
You are sweet, and you look damn pretty.
Why don't you find someone your own age?
I don't know.
- I like mature men.
- And you think my father's mature?
Yes.
Anyway, you're also quite mature.
May I?

It's like back in the old days.
I can still remember
some of the forbidden steps.
- Leif.
- What?
- Don't bother...
- Oh, come on.
- Try and let me lead.
- Leif, it's not funny.
- Didn't you hear what she said?
- Let your Mom and me dance tonight, ok?
- No, shut the hell up!
- Please don't...
- Can't you just go away?
- Don't push me.
Would you shut the fuck up.
Otherwise, I'll kill you!
- You've always been a such a crappy Dad!
- Kenneth!
- You stay away, man!
- "Leife-luffe", honey.
- "Leife-luffe", are you okay?
- Don't call me "Leife-luffe".
Kenneth!
Kenneth?


























I was out looking for Kenneth.
Yeah, well then go look for Kenneth.




























Stay away.
Understand?
What are you doing? Now they all think
we're violent psychopaths.
- You're completely infatuated with him.
- Yes, I think he's lovely.
So you are admitting it? Then maybe
you should marry him instead of me.
You've almost been glued
to each other all night!
Honey, he's into guys.
- What?
- He's gay.
How the hell do you know?
From Marco. I'm not
supposed to tell anyone.
Alessandro is afraid of what
happens when he tells his family.
Actually, it's you he's chased all along.
Now go down and apologize,
and then we can dance together afterwards.



I know I shouldn't have hit him.
But I get so fucking furious
when I see him.
If there was just one good thing
about him, but there isn't.
- Yes, there is.
- What? Honestly.
What was it that made you
fall for him back then?
I remember that grandmother
said that he had table manners.
Which meant that he was well raised.
- I still shouldn't have hit him.
- No, he'll be fine.
He's a big guy.
- It was stupid of me to come down here.
- No, it wasn't.
Otherwise, we wouldn't have been sitting
here with our feet in the water.
…the two of us.
I'm so glad you broke the arm.
- Mom, stop.
- What is it?
What is it?
- Shouldn't you go to bed?
- Nope. Why?
Why are you here?
I don't believe Patrick wants this, Mom.
Why would you say that?
There's something very wrong.
I know I'm not the most
beautiful girl in the world...
but he doesn't want to be with me at all.
He wants to party with his
weird father and Alessandro...
and wine and food and friends.
But he just doesn't want me.
You're not even contradicting me.
I'm so stupid, I haven't
been able to see it.
You're not stupid. You're the
most beautiful girl in the world.
Maybe he's just nervous and stressed?
Well, yes. But, it's not just that.
I can tell, he's not crazy about me.
He doesn't even look me in the eye.
It could be hard for him.
Then he has to stand on his toes.
Mom, why are you always trying
to be funny at the wrong time?
I'm sorry.
He gets so jealous, when someone
as much as looks at me...
and then he won't even
touch me when we're alone.
We haven't even slept together,
while we've been here.
Don't you just think he's afraid?
I don't know.
I don't know anything.




































Hi. Listen up...
We're going to be a little more delayed.
Tilde?
Is there something we as
guests can do to help?
No, I don't believe there is.
Will there be anything to drink?
The elderly are burning up out here.
Shh.
Don't say "shh" to me.
I'm just trying to help.
Here you go, honey.
Yes, we're sorry,
but we're not getting married.
Sorry that we've dragged you
down here for nothing.
We're not enemies.
We just can't stand here and lie
to each other and ourselves.
I'm so sick and tired of this,
pretending that everything is fine.
Or that we do as we've always done...
because we get too sad, if we're honest.
I'm so tired of your lies.
You can't lie your way through
life, just because it's easier.
When I look at you, I am sure...
that's how you get
fat and old and unhappy.
I don't want to be like that.
It's nobody's fault.
Yes, it is fucking someone's fault.
It has nothing to do with Astrid. It is
I who have been a fool from the start.
- Right?
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
But it doesn't matter now.
We are not right for each other.
So we should not….
We still have the possibility to choose.
OK, I can't keep my
mouth shut any longer.
What are we doing then?
Is there still a buffet?
What about all the presents?
I think we need just a little information.
Okay. Well, then. I can say that
I'm trying to get home tonight.
The rest of you can just do
whatever you feel like.
Come on, let's go.

Let me carry that.


Leif?
Ida, I cannot live without you.
I've been a fool. I hope
you can forgive me. You were right.
- The two of us really belong together.
- What about Tilde?
I'll never see her again.
It was a huge mistake,
and that comes from deep within my heart.
- You're the only woman for me.
- Why do you suddenly say that?
That's the truth. Haven't you always said
that a family should stick together?
- Yes.
- And the two of us are right for each other.
I had just completely forgotten
how beautiful and wonderful you are.
I really love you.
I always have.
Would you please take me back, Ida?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, Ida.
It is a completely natural reaction
to believe that it has returned.
Yes, but I have a bad feeling.
I felt a lump.
I can't feel any lump.
But it could be you're right.
Your prognosis is not overwhelming.
I won't give you false hope,
but I couldn't feel anything.
If I were to send everyone who had a
bad feeling a large examination...
then the system would collapse.
I think we should wait, as long as we are
talking about psychological symptoms.
So, it is psychological
when I can feel a lump?
But I'm telling you, I can't feel it.
If you knew what people come running to me with.
I had one last week who could
feel a squirrel in his head.
I would very, very much like
an examination.
How about curling it up at the sides?
When it's flat, it looks
a little like John Lennon's hair.
- Ida, could you get a cup of coffee?
- Yes, of course.


























- Ida, I mustn't say, but...
- No, shut up, Vibe.



- Hopefully he hasn't.
- Yes, he has.
And I love Leif.
And I will not have
more clutter in my life.




He's only been trimmed on one side.
Now you need to keep your mouth shut.
Otherwise you'll be trimmed on the other.
Well, thanks for the food.
I just had a great idea.
We'll get a supplementary loan...
and then take a
long vacation! Sound good?
- Yes.
- To the Seychelles.
It's expensive, but
it's very beautiful. Hello!
- Is something wrong?
- Yes. I don't want to.
Good. Then we can use the money
for something else.
Well I...
I don't want to do anything with you, Leif.
Well then... use the
money on yourself.
Leif, we shouldn't be together any more.
It's over.
I don't want to...
sit here drinking
coffee when we grow old.
I'm leaving now, Leif.
Where are you going?
Ida, I'm talking to you.
Where are you going?
Ida?
Where are you going to go?
Bye.
Ida?
Ida, dammit!
Ida.
