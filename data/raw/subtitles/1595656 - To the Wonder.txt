If I left you because you

It would mean
I didn't love you.
I don't expect anything.
Just to go a little

A couple of months.
How do you
like it so far?
I like it.
- Do you have any children?
- I have a daughter.
She's 10.
- ( baby cries )
- I bet it's hard
Being a single mom.
I know my daughter's
a little younger,
But it would be fun for them
to get together, maybe.
It's kind of a hard age

There's tons of stuff.
It's super clean.

Are you

We're doing

Remedial work?
We're looking to make sure
there's no toxins.
( man mutters )
I got stuff on my house.
Kids acting strange.
Sometimes we see tar
Coming out in the cracks
in the patio.
The neighbors here,
they had their house
in escrow.
They pulled out.
The buyers pulled out.
Yeah.
That's too bad.
The reports
from the lab came in.
It showed the presence
of lead and cadmium
In the surface soil
and in the dust
In the schoolyards...
( continues speaking )
( water flowing )

( marina, in french )
what is this love
that loves us?
That comes from nowhere.
From all around.

You, cloud.
You love me, too.

You called her
your daughter.
( chuckles )
( in french )
I'm writing my thoughts.
( exhales sharply )
( birds chirping )
You love me?
( in english )
of course.
( tatiana, in french )
I don't have any friends.
In paris I had lots.
( birds chirping )

( tatiana and marina

We need to leave.
- Both of us.
- ( shushes )
There's something
missing.
( distant kids playing )
- ( man, in english )
there is a love...
- ( grunts )
...That is like a stream
that goes dry
When rain
no longer feeds it.
- But there is a love...
- ( baby fussing )
...That is like a spring
coming up from the earth.
The first is human love,
the second is divine love
And has its source above.
The husband is
to love his wife
As christ loved the church,
And give his life for her.
He does not find her lovely--
he makes her lovely.
But there is a grace that
comes in such a marriage.
( marina, in english )
I got married when I was 17.
And I had a child.
But my husband
Started running
after other women.
And he left us
And went
to canary islands.
And other priests have
told me that
In the eyes of the church
I'm still married to that man.
They said I couldn't
have the sacraments.
I want to be a wife.
- ( clinks )
- ( girl speaking )
I don't even know why I was
with him in the first place.
Then it sunk in.
I didn't really want
to tell my dad
Because I knew
he would start yelling.
- ( continues speaking )
- ( distant siren blaring )
Girl:
I'd never give her up.
Ever.
( distant chattering )
( priest, in spanish )
everywhere you're present.
And still I can't see you.
( crickets chirping )
You're within me.
Around me.
And I have
no experience of you.
Not as I once did.
Why don't I hold on
to what I've found?
- ( clicks )

you see that red band
in the sky right there?
And you see that blue
down below it?
That's the earth's shadow
on the atmosphere.
Look. You see
what I'm talking about?
Stop for a second.
- You see?
- ( females speaking french )
( switch clicking )
( sighing )
- ( neil speaks )

I'm not looking at you.
I don't want
to look at you.
You're not my father.
You think you're my father.
You're not.

You're annoying me.

father, I'm going
to pray for you.
Thank you very much.
( speaks spanish )
So you will receive
the gift of joy.
Me?
Because you're
so unhappy.
( man speaks softly )
'cause you don't
come out too much.
Do you get lonely all the time,
or most of the time
When ain't nobody around?
So what you got
to say about it?
You gotta have
a little more excitement.
Just like when me and you
are around, and there
ain't nobody around.
"hey!"
The power hits you, brother.
It always hits me.
You can just say, "hey, power,"
and it hits me.
Hits me before
I can get it out.
( speaks in tongues )
see, the devil don't know
what I'm saying.
And you won't know
and I won't know.
I can feel the warmth
of the light, brother.
That's spiritual.
I'm feeling more
than just natural light.
Feeling the spiritual
light, see?
I can almost touch that light,
coming right from the sky.

The parish has grown a lot.
And we really
need more room
For the community
to get together.
We have plays,
we have dinners,
We have parties.
We have c.C.D.
In the parish hall.

( mutters in english )

it was there...
( continues speaking )
( both speak softly )
( quintana, in spanish )
let me come to you.
- ( woman speaks english )
- ( deaf woman speaking )
( quintana, in spanish )
let me not pretend.
( deaf woman, in english )
everything that's happening...
( continues speaking )
( quintana, in spanish )
pretend to feelings
I don't have.
( deaf woman
continues speaking )
( quintana, in english )
man is in revolt
against god.
The prophet hosea saw
In the breakdown
of his marriage
The spiritual infidelity
of his people.
In that broken marriage,
we see the pattern
of our world.
We wish to live inside
the safety of the laws.
We fear to choose.
Jesus
Insists on choice.
The one thing
he condemns utterly
Is avoiding the choice.
To choose is
to commit yourself,
And to commit yourself
is to run the risk--
Is to run the risk
of failure,
The risk of sin,
the risk of betrayal.
But jesus can deal
with all of those.
Forgiveness
he never denies us.
The man who makes
a mistake
Can repent.
But the man who hesitates,
Who does nothing,
Who buries his talent
In the earth...
With him,
he can do nothing.
( in french )
my visa has expired.
We need to face the facts.

I have to look at
Some of these creeks

You talk

Someone you'd known
in your youth.

No, he claimed he didn't
want to have kids
While he was in school.

He believed that.
Will you pray with me?

Neil:
I had no faith.
You knew.
Were you afraid?
Jane:
My mother says
I'm chasing moonbeams.
- Is that what she said?
- ( hums agreement, chuckles )
I told her I'd rather
Have a moonbeam than
The life I had before.
( jane speaks softly )
( insects chittering )

Jane:
Do you want this?
Do you know
what you want?
I can't afford
To make mistakes
with men anymore.
I want you to come
more often.
Can you?
( faintly )
I've been waiting for you.
- I felt wild.

I don't know.

You.

You took me.

I can't take it here
anymore.
Paris is dreadful.
I don't see tatiana.
She's gone...
To live with her father.
I can't find a job.
I want to come back
to the states.
I met someone who told me
He'd marry me
so I could get a green card.

Be faithful only to you...

I feel so close to you...
That I could almost
touch you.
There is always this
invisible something...
- That I feel so strongly...
- ( grunts )
-  Which ties us
so tightly together.
-  ( children playing )
I love this feeling...
Even if it makes me
cry sometimes.
It is so strong,
this conviction...
That I belong to you.
( singing in french )
( speaks french )

How's everything there?
You miss
being here?
It's great here.
Honestly, at dad's
it's so much fun.
Did the tooth fairy

No, I'm the one
who took it out.
It didn't hurt?

You're so pretty.

The divine presence...
Which sleeps in each man,
each woman.
You say...
"christ said this.
Christ said that."
what do you say?
And what you say,
Does it come
from god within?
Answer that
Which is of god,
In every woman,
every man.
Know each other
in that love
That never changes.
( continues speaking )
( man speaking softly )
I'd like to show you
here on the monitor...
- ( beeps )
- this is the area
of your uterus
And the I.U.D. That you
have in place there.
We feel like
one of the less
risky procedures
That we can do is
to remove this device.
And we see if those
symptoms don't resolve.
I think something that
You and your husband
need to consider
Is with the absence
of the I.U.D.,
Is this a time
that you may want
to think about children?
Or is there another means
for contraception?
So I don't need to have
a hysterectomy?
That's the good news.
Thank you.
( doctor continues, softly )
Would you like
to have children?
Marina:
Someday.
( bell tolling )
Man:
God gave us marriage
as a holy mystery...
In which a man and woman
are joined together...
And become one.
And with affection
and tenderness...
Freely give themselves
to each other.
Neil:
This ring I give you...
Is a sign of our
constant faith...
...Is a sign of
our constant faith...
...And abiding love.
...And abiding love.

In a dream you can be...

Dead?

no, my bag!
You're crazy!

You don't need anything.
You're free.
We're gypsies.
You're like me.

I was drunk.
If I had done this,
I'm not saying I did,
I might've, I could've.
I'm asking

I can't help myself.
If you need me
to kneel down,
I'll kneel down.

Where are you?

Priest:
Love is not only a feeling.
Love is a duty.
You shall love.
Love is a command.
And you say,
"I can't command my emotions.
They come and go
like clouds."
To that, christ says,
"you shall love
Whether you like it
or not.
You fear
your love has died."

to be transformed
Into something higher."

What a cruel war.

One...
Full of love for you.
The other...
Pulls me down
towards the earth.

Man:
Don't take up with anybody
during the first six months.
Don't stop talking
to people.
That's the first mistake
that I see people make
in my practice.
Sometimes you eat the bear,
And sometimes
the bear eats you.
You can't feel sorry
for yourself.
- ( speaks softly )
once we get her served...
- ( phone ringing )
...That'll start
the process.
Because there's
no children involved,
This could be
a fairly rapid process,
if that's what you want.
And I don't want you
to lose hope...
( speaking softly )
( breathes heavily )
Quintana:
It's very hard to be
The one
who loves less,
The one who's stronger.
You have to struggle
with yourself.
You have to struggle
with your own...
Strength.

Neil:
Why?
( thunder rumbles )
Neil:
I saw you.
Again.

Quintana:
They are sending me away.
I won't be here for long.
They are sending me
to western kansas.
Western kansas?
What are you gonna do
in western kansas?
A lot of people around here
Is going to be missing you.

here in bartlesville.
To preach the gospel.
That's why we have churches.
