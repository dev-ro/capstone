No, of course not. How could I know?

["Shik Shak Shok"
by Hassan Abou El Seoud plays]
[reporter in English]
The Syrian revolution is starting.
People all on the streets,
demanding the removal
of President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus.
We are together, Sunnis and Alawites...
[in Arabic] Sara, what are you doing?
Come dance with us.
- In a minute.
- What are you watching?
[in English] A group of Syrian women
are shouting...
[in Arabic] I told you
not to watch these things.
This is reality, Mama.
What happened in Tunisia,
Egypt, and Libya is happening here.
[mother] And I've told you
nothing like that can happen in Syria.
[in English] The anger is building...
[mother in Arabic] Yalla, darling.
[Sara] The party's boring.
I don't want to.
[mother] Come on, for your sister's sake.
[song continues]
Uncle, come on.
[in English] Everyone say "cheese."
[all] Cheese!
[man in Arabic] I thank God day and night
for blessing me with three daughters,
stronger than a thousand sons.
But don't forget how lucky these girls are
that I'm their dad
and their coach.
Here he goes.
[man chuckles]
Two weeks ago, at the qualifying meet
for the National Championships,
Yusra improved her personal best
in the 100m butterfly.
[man 2] Congrats, Yusra.
But Sara won her heat too.
[man] Yeah, Sara is headstrong
and a leader like me.
But Yusra has discipline,
strength, and perseverance.
She is my powerhouse.
What about me?
And you, Shahed, Daddy's darling,
are my little warrior.
Dear guests,
I will be the first father in history
to have three daughters
swimming in the Olympics.

No, you can't do that.
[indistinct chatter, laughter]
No, I swear you can't do that.
[in English] It's late. We should go home.
[in Arabic] Why?
[in English] We have to be
at the pool at six.
Do you seriously think
there's any point in training anymore?
- If I want to make the Olympics.
- [Sara] The Olympics?
Swimming for who?
There's no country left anymore.
Syria's gone! Bah. Haven't you noticed?
[sirens in background]
It is still early.
[indistinct shouting in background]
[Nizar in Arabic] What?

[Sara] In a bombing.

[in Arabic] My God...

Good night, my love.

Do you know what your dad

[in English] Sorry.

You have training in the morning.

You know he went to Sydney when he was 15?
[father exclaims]
[announcer] But here comes Phelps!
[Yusra] The youngest American swimmer
to compete at the Olympics.
[announcer] He gets it done!
A new Olympic record.
You aren't a true athlete
unless your dream is the Olympics.
[clicks tongue, sighs]
You're not going to represent us
at the Nationals this time.
Yusra and Arwa got better times than you.
[airplane overhead]
[announcer] Everything going perfectly
for Michael Phelps here in Beijing.
- [Sara in English] Hala left for Germany.
- [Yusra] What?
- She went alone without her family.
- Why didn't she tell us?
She's gonna apply
for this family reunion thing.
When younger than 18, you have to write
for your family to join you.
Can't believe she didn't tell us.
["Eda Eda" by El Sawareekh plays]

Omar?
From Duma? What are you doing here?
- [laughs]
- [Yusra] Sara.
Why are you laughing?
Since when has laughing become illegal?
Give me your ID.
Please, she didn't mean disrespect.
Shut up, you.
[Sara] I'm not disrespecting.
Don't talk too much. Understand?
Raise your arms.
You'd do this to your sisters?
You're not my sister.

Is this your sister?
Stand up.

YOUR PLANES CAN'T BOMB OUR DREAMS
[indistinct chatter]
[father] How can I let my girls
travel across Europe on their own?
What happened to
the strong daughters you raised?
You know Razan Haddad is
my third friend to die this month?
[siren in background]
You know how many times
we've come close to death?
We need to get Yusra to Germany
as soon as possible before she turns 18.
[gunfire in distance]
[mother] The problem is
it's so dangerous, my love.
I wish you could go on a plane.
Because European countries
are just handing out visas to Syrians.
Mama, it's very easy. We get to Germany
and apply for family reunion,
and you can all come on a plane.
It's simple.
So I let you two risk your lives,
crawl through the most dangerous parts
of Europe, to get us plane tickets?
Everyone's doing it. Hala did it.
She told me it's really easy...
[gasps]
[Yusra] My darling, come here.
- [father] It's out in the neighborhood.
- [Shahed] I'm scared of the dark.
Don't be scared, little one.
I hope the car battery will last.
[Yusra] Yalla, see? Now eat up.
I wish we could go back to Darayya.
- Darayya is still too dangerous.
- The whole of Syria is too dangerous.
But you and your sister walking
across Europe isn't dangerous at all?
Yes, but once we arrive,
we'll all be safe.
That's if you arrive.
And if you arrive, what will you be?
Refugees?
And you'll ruin your swimming careers.
[Sara] It's the best way.
[father] She always thinks
she has the best way.
[angrily] You're not going.
That's the end of it.
If I was the one who was 17,
you'd let me go on my own.
[in English] It's your precious Yusra
you don't want to risk.
[door closes]
[indistinct chatter]
[in Arabic] Baba, about Sara...
Stop thinking about her.
Concentrate.
In the water, you're on your own.
It's your fight.
Your aim is to win.
It's not about being nice.
You have a goal, and you must reach it.
Focus on all the things
you have control over.
The start.
Streamline.
The kick off the wall. Your breathing.
[in English] Find your lane.
Swim your race.

He'll travel with me and Sara
and protect us.
I wouldn't trust him
to cross the road with you,
let alone take you all the way to Germany.
[mother] But, Ezzat,
Nizar is their cousin.
- You know he would never leave them.
- Whose side are you on?
[mother] I'm not taking sides.
This isn't about us.
It's about the girls' lives.
They don't have a future here anymore.
They're not going to summer camp.
Aren't you a mother?
[distant announcement in Arabic]
Baba, you see what's happening.
The situation's gone from bad to worse.
How am I gonna make it
to the Olympics if I can't swim?
I promise, when I get to Europe,
I'll keep training.
All the swimmers are leaving.
See? I want to go.
I want to keep training.
I'll have to go with you.
[Sara] And leave Mama and Shahed
on their own?
What will become of me
if something happens to her?
[Sara] Nothing will happen.
Nizar and I will be with her.
I promise.
[exhales deeply]
[Yusra] Thank you, Baba.
[in English] Please,
don't make me look like a liar.
[in Arabic] I'm not going with you.
[in English] OK? It's cold there,
and I don't like the cold.
And I don't speak German. I speak English.
Romy knows a sponsor in Canada.
He's gonna help me with my papers,
so I can go to Toronto.
- It never works, these things.
- [scoffs]
Canada is colder than Germany.
So good luck!
[speaks Arabic]
[in English] Is she right?
[in Arabic] Dunno.
[in English] Canada is
colder than Germany?
- Of course.
- [Sara] Don't think Germany. Think Berlin.
DJ capital of the world,
parties that go on all weekend.
Underground clubs.
Berghain.
- How do you know Berghain?
- Of course I know.
DJ Niz needs European exposure.
More people will listen to your mixes.
How can you let your two favorite cousins
go to Europe without you?
But you're not my favorite cousins.
I have other cousins who are nice to me.
Fine. I will go without you.
[indistinct chatter]
[Ezzat in Arabic] You fly to Istanbul
on a tourist visa.
If anyone asks anything, you're tourists
going to Turkey on holiday.
Find a smuggler
to take you over the Bulgarian border.
This route is more expensive
than the sea crossing, but much safer.
- Ten thousand euros. Guard it.
- How did you get it?
[distant sirens]
I borrowed it.
Isn't it too much, Baba?
Keep some for yourselves.
I'll try to get more
in case you get stuck.
But if you do get stuck,
you do the talking.
Of course. Don't worry, Uncle.
This is yours.
Tell people you swam for your country.
That has to matter.
You too, Sara.
[bird chirps]
Can I borrow your Converse?
No, they are too big for you,
and I'm taking them with me.
Can I use your nail polish?
[chuckles softly]
No, you'll ruin it.
Can I come with you?
Who would take care of Lulu?
[bird chirps]
Look what I made you.
You made this?
[Shahed] It's to help you get to Germany.
Oh, my love.
I'm going to take it with me.
Let's put Lulu in her cage
before she poops on your bed.
Lulu.
[both laugh]
[laughing continues]
- [Shahed] Come help us.
- What are you doing?
[Yusra] Lulu's flying!
[laughing and exclaiming]
[mother] When you were born,
I decided to give you
the things I didn't have.
Freedom to choose
whatever you want in life.
When I closed my eyes
and imagined your futures...
[Ezzat] Here he comes.
[mother] ...I didn't picture you in
a wedding dress like the other mothers.
Sorry I'm late.
[Ezzat] What happened to you?
I forgot my passport.
Habibi...
All I hoped was for you
to graduate from the best universities...
Don't worry. They are like my sisters.
I'll guard them with my life.
Come here.
[mother] Having wonderful careers
and living the best life,
that was everything I wished for.
And we'll have all these things, Mama.
[mother] Hopefully.

[Ezzat] Do you really know?
Don't go. Please don't go.

all the Syrians go to. We should go there.
You think you're gonna handle

This is what you agreed with Baba.

Turkey has more than two million Syrians,

Yeah, so where do we go?
We've taken the wrong bridge.
[in English] Change of plan.
No more following Nizar. Following them.
- What?
- From now on, we share leadership. Yalla.
When exactly did I have leadership?

[Sara] See? We should have been
in charge from the start.
[song ends]
[indistinct chatter]
[in Arabic] They have SIM cards.
- [in English] Do you speak English?
- [vendor] A little.
We want SIM cards for Europe.
[indistinct chatter]
[in Arabic] What?
Why are they dressed like that?
They can't sell the suits,
so they put life jackets on them.
- [Nizar in English] How much, please?
- $2,000 each.
- $2,000?
- Yes.
He says he can get us
on a boat straight to Lesbos.
A bus will take us down to the coast.
It's $2,000 each.
We pay half now and half when we arrive.
[Yusra] Baba said not to get on a boat.
[Nizar] He says the boats
have been getting through now.
Do you know how long it takes
to walk the Bulgarian route?
I don't know.
I think it's the best option.
It's one boat, a few hours,
and then we're in Greece. In Europe.
[Sara] I can't believe
we're talking about taking a boat
with the only Mardini who can't swim.
- [Nizar] No, habibi, I can swim.
- I think we should go with him.

I'm going to miss him

Oh, we are also going to Germany.
To Hanover. We have a friend there.
Oh.

- [Nizar in Arabic] Where you from?
I've come from Sudan with my wife, Onnab.
We're going to Sweden, hopefully.

I am from Eritrea.

[Nizar] Guys, it won't sink.
[in English] We won't sink.

Yes, that's fuel. It's good.
We're gonna be good. Don't worry.

- [Bilal] OK.
Hold it.
[worried chatter]
[in Arabic] Let me pass.
[in English] Sit down.
You have to keep the balance of the boat.
[in Arabic] Watch out for the kids.
The kids!
[Nizar] Listen to me. Listen.
[in English] I studied
mechanical engineering.
[in Arabic] I studied mechanical
engineering. I'll try to fix the engine.
[clamoring and panicked chatter]
[overlapping chatter]
Stay calm.
- [Emad] What do you know?
- [Bilal] Sir, you know how to do this?
[in English] I don't know, but I will try.
I'm in my first year, OK?

[Emad unmuffled] We're doing
the same thing over and over again.
[Nizar in Arabic] Guys, I've got network.
The coastguards. It's ringing.
[in English] Hello?
Help. We need emergency assistance.
We're in a boat
stuck between Ayvalik, Turkey, and Lesbos.
Our engine has stopped.
But we are in Greek waters!
- [coastguard] Can you go back?
- No, we can't go back. We are sinking.
You don't understand. We have children.
We have women. We are going to die.
Please, I don't understand.
We will die. Please. Hello?
He said it's not their policy.

We must try. Bilal.

Keep the balance of the boat!
Sara. Sara, what are you doing?
- [Sara] Help me with the rope.
- Sara!
- [Nizar] Sara, sit down.
- [in Arabic] Sara, what are you doing?
[in English] We need to
make the boat lighter.
Please!
Sara.
- Just keep bailing.
- OK.
- Sara!
- [screaming]
[Nizar] Sara!
Sara!
[in Arabic] No. No, Yusra. You'll die.
For God's sake, don't do this!
[in English] Please! I'm not letting her
in the water. Leave me alone!
[Sara in Arabic] Don't let her get in.
[Nizar] What can I do?
[in English] If you go in, I go in.
[Sara] No!
[muffled water gurgling]
[inhales deeply]
Sara's right. We're too heavy.
I can't swim.
If I could swim, I'd be in there.
It's OK. It's OK.
[man] No!

[in Arabic] I saw this seagull
floating above us.
It stayed with us for a long time.
For some reason,
it felt like it was guiding us.
All I was thinking was how
Mama and Baba had no idea where we were.
And how we didn't answer the phone.
And how stupid it would be
for swimmers to die in the sea.
Do you know what Baba will do
if he knows I let you get in the water?
He'll be proud.
- [indistinct chatter]
- [ship's horn blares]
- [in English] One tea for Sara.
- Thank you.
One tea for me,
and one, two, three, four... 125 sugar...

- ...for Sara.
Now, what you both did in the sea,
it was...
I'm sorry I couldn't stay in, you know.
I don't know how you...
Well, she got in the sea first.
She's a superhero.
I agree.
You could have told me that
you were professional swimmers.
[all chuckling]
If there's anything you both need,
you just ask me.
Well, the only thing I need now
is to wash my hair.
- It's full of salt.
- Ah, there's showers behind this building.
[Yusra] Really?
- But the queue was very long.
- [Sara] Queue?
Come on. Superheroes don't queue.
OK.
[Sara] I'll find a shower without a queue.
- Yalla, let's do it.
- What are you doing?
- [Yusra] We need to look European.
- [Sara] And rich.
This way, you will see that I have money.
- We need to work on this boy here.
- No.
- Unbutton this.
- Trust us.
[Emad] I don't trust you.
Look at me.
- What is this hair?

[Yusra laughs] It's awful.
You look like a very big businessman,

[Sara] So how are we gonna get to Germany?
[Emad] We should all follow
the train tracks from city to city,
through Greece, Macedonia,
Serbia, and Hungary,
Austria, to Germany.
It will be safer if we travel together.

[Shada sings a gentle melody]

Is he dead?
My husband is
not good man.
[indistinct voice on radio]
[baby whines]
You don't wear hijab. You swim.
I have never met a girl like you before.
Well, my dad was a professional swimmer.
He swam for Syria,
and he loved it so much.
But he had to stop.
And, actually, he only had daughters,
so he had to train us.
He was our coach, my sister and I.
And now you are his ambition.
Yes.
I love it. Swimming is home for me.
I feel like it's where I belong.
[sighs] And...
one day, I want to swim in the Olympics.
I was hoping Rio.
[baby whines]
But it feels so far away right now.
I don't know if I can do it.
I believe you can do it.
[Emad] So what will you do in Hanover?
Bring the rest of my family over.
And then?
I don't know. Sing a song, plant a tree.
- [Emad chuckles]
- [Sara] And I want to study.
Art, maybe.
I want to study too. Literature.
Yeah, I must also find a job.
I have to send money home.
To your wife?
No, I am not married.
- Are you?
- [man] Hey.
Name one married superhero.
- Ah, didn't Superman marry Lois Lane?
- [man] You speak English?
Female superhero.
Hey, you speak English?
- English?
- Yes.
You cross border at Tabanovce,
they will put you in camp.
Who?
Serbian police.
They will take your fingerprints.
Once they take your fingerprints,
you are stuck.
I can take you to Hungary.
No police. No fingerprint. No problem.
- [Emad] How much?
- [man] Five hundred euro each.
- [Emad] Yeah?
- [man] Yeah.
[Yusra] Are we crazy to do this?

Hey, stop.
You said you'd take us to Hungary!
Where are we?
I don't know.
Let's just go this way, OK?
- [squelching]

[Sara] What's happening?
- It's razor wire.

Push.
[Emad] It's OK.
[Shada] Be careful.

[Shada] OK. It's OK.

- [Bilal] Budapest, Hungary.
Eight hundred euro.
[Bilal] For everyone?
- Each?!
- [Emad] No, that's too much.
Maybe you want police to catch you.
[siren wailing in the distance]
[Emad] Wait. Wait. Wait.
What are you doing?
Better not to look so foreign.
[in Arabic] Maybe it's better?
Yes, no problem.

I speak English if you want to.
I want to be

It is not quite on a biblical scale,
but an exodus it certainly is.
The refugees and migrants
who've been trapped now deciding to walk.
They're marching all the way to Germany.
They've set out on a hopeless quest,
but the fact they've done this at all
reflects their desperation
being stuck in Budapest.
You can come to the UK with us.
If you need to.
The German chancellor Angela Merkel
has been calling for a coordinated
European response to the crisis.
Thinks Merkel is his mother.

He was recommended to Bilal

I can't.

Go alone if you want to.
We'll meet in Germany.
- You expect me to leave you?
- You already did.
What's going on?
She won't get into the truck.
[speaking Arabic]
[in English] You OK? What happen?
[Nizar] We've decided
not to take the truck.
[Shada] But what will you do?
Join the march to Germany, I guess.
I can't walk anymore.

We will all meet again.
I'm sure of it.

- I'm serious. Yalla, quick.
Get your things. There's a bus.
It has been sent by the Austrians
or maybe the Germans. I don't know.
But they saw the march,
and they want to help us. Hmm?
Do you know what's the best part?
We don't need tickets.
What? It's free?

and we won't ever get out.
No one cares.
[in Arabic] Maybe we should go home.
We're not going back now, Yusra.
Don't you see how far we've come?
I'm not giving up now.
Look at me.
[Yusra sniffs]
[Sara sighs]
I listened to you before.
Now you need to listen to me.
Listen to you?
If we went with the others.
If we didn't come at all.
So it's my fault?
Is it mine?
Why did you bring me here if you hate me?
To save you.
And save the family.
[sobs]
Was that man trying to save me?
I wouldn't have let him hurt you.
I wouldn't let him do anything to you.
[exhales shakily]
I'm scared something bad
will happen again.
I wouldn't be able to take it.

would you go without me?
Of course, yes.
No. We go together or not at all.

I don't hate you either.

We both swam for our country, in Syria,
and I even competed
in the world championship.
I went to Russia, and...
This is a real swimming club, yes?
I mean, people train
to be professional here?
Because I wanna go to the Olympics.
My father was training us.
- I wish I could help. The club is full.
- I told them already.
- Yeah, have a good day.
- Have a nice day. Thank you.
Wait. I swim 200m freestyle in 2.12
and the 100m butterfly in 1.09.
- Butterfly in 1.09?
- Yes.
- She kidding?
- No, no. She swims. She swims.
OK.
OK, I have a small break
before my eleven o'clock session,
so in the indoor pool if you're quick.
[repeating] Thank you.
OK.
But I don't have swimsuit.
You don't have a swimsuit?
[Yusra] And goggles.
[speaking German]
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- OK. Yes, you're welcome.
Let's go.
[coach] Hey, hey.
What's your name?
Yusra Mardini.
Yeah, and I'm Sara.
Who are you?
Sven.
Thank you, Sven.
- Nice to meet you.
- [Lena] Let's go, girls.
- [Sara speaks Arabic]
- [Yusra] We've gotta swim now!
[beep]
[Sven] OK.
Ready, set...
[Yusra] Sara!
[Yusra] Why did you do that?
[Sara chuckles]
Very good. You can both swim.
We have two training sessions
every day except Sunday.
[door buzzes]
Yep, this one.
[PA] Salaam alaikum.
If you think you might be suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder
or would like to discuss
your mental health with a professional,
a nurse will be available
on Saturday mornings in hangar five.
Thank you so much for all this.
Yeah, you're welcome.
It's just whatever I could get.
But if you're serious,
we need to go shopping,
find you things that properly fit.
You don't think I'm a serious swimmer?
I want you to write
to the Syrian national team.
- [Sara] He's done enough.
- I want you to tell them my times.
I don't want them to think
I'm not training for the Olympics,
so please tell them I'll be ready for Rio.
OK. But there are some local swim meets
I want us to aim for first. OK?
[playful screaming]
OK. Uh... [gasps]
How do you sleep with all this noise?
We don't.
[announcement on PA]
[whistle blows]
[Sven] Yusra told me what happened,
about you swimming across the Greek sea.
Hey, you both deserve a medal for that.
Yeah, but we weren't the only ones.
Just, um...
We're actually pretty lucky we survived.
Many don't.
So...
Nah, I don't want a medal.
I'm... I'm sorry.
[sighs]
[Sven] Hey. Yusra, here.
This is your room.
[Yusra] You're so kind.
The club management said you can use it
until your papers come through.
[Yusra] Thank you.
[Sven] It's not much, I know,
but no visiting teams.
But at least it's quiet.
And it's close to the pool.
[Yusra] This is amazing.
And I'm your guarantor, so no parties, OK?
- Or I get in trouble.
- [both laugh]
[chuckles] OK, settle in,
then we're gonna see us for training.
Thank you so much.
- Welcome.
- See you.
[speaking German]
Yeah!
[both chuckling]
[both exclaiming]
[Sven] OK, come.
You need a break.
- [Sara] No.
- [Sven] It's not a question. Take a break.
[Sara sighs]
[Sven] Sara.
[Sara] My shoulder... [groans]
Mmm. [grunts]
It's always the swimming sisters.
The sisters did this.
The sisters did that.
The sisters won this.
The sisters won that.
I still have to sleep
with five strangers in a room.
Oh, stop it, Nizar. Eat something.
[Yusra] We don't like you
being stuck there either.
But if only you could swim.
Exactly.
If only I could swim.
I can't do anything here.
And I'm not allowed to work
until I get my papers.
I wish I never agreed with you
to come here.
Even if you're one of the lucky ones
and you actually make it,
there's nothing here to come for, nothing,
except waiting and paperwork.
Unless you are the Mardini sisters.
[Yusra] My times are better back home.
[Sven] You had to escape a war.
Of course it will set you back.
[whistles]
[Yusra] You tried, right?
For the Olympics.
- I saw your pictures on the wall.
- Yeah. Yeah, I tried.
And why didn't you succeed?
Was it talent or discipline?
[chuckles]
[Sven] It, um...
OK, I think
it's not always so black and white.
Um...
I didn't believe in myself.
I was swimming to avoid losing,
not to win.
Hey, you need to give yourself a break.
Stop being so hard on yourself, OK?
Get some rest.
- Rest?
- Yeah.
And what about Rio?
OK. How do I say this? Um...
Yusra, um... [sighs]
It's fantastic that you have dreams,
but we need to be realistic.
I want to keep working with you,
but you're not going to be
swimming for Syria.
You're not gonna make it to Rio.
I'm sorry.
There are other competitions
we can focus on. We can focus on...
Yusra.
Yusra. Hey, it's step-by-step.
Yusra, that's not your session!
["Moodswung" by Murlo plays]
- [crash]
- [Sara calls out]
- [Yusra] You forgot evening training.
- [Sara] Yeah, I was busy.
Busy partying with friends?
You know it's disrespectful to Sven.
You need to tell him
instead of not showing up.
Do you realize
that neither of us chose to swim?
- Do you remember starting?
- I remember us loving swimming.
If we're not here to do our best,
why did we bother coming?
Maybe it's not as easy being here
for everyone else as it is for you.
FOREIGNERS OUT
Nizar.
You can't be on Arab time here.
- Sorry. Sorry.
- It's been one hour!
[in Arabic] I'm not sleeping well.
- [in English] No?
- [Emad] Nizar! Sara!
- Nizar!
- Oh, Emad!
- No, you can't come through here.
- [Sara] We're coming.
- We're coming.
- OK.
How are we gonna pass?
I'm sorry.
- [Nizar] OK, sorry.
- Come!
- Sorry.
- Come!
Nizar, here. Sorry, they're my friends.
- Sorry, sorry.
- Yalla.
This way. Sorry.
- Sorry.
- How are you? I can't believe you're here.
- Yes, I'm here.
- Sorry. Sorry. Hey, Emad!
- How are you?
- I miss you, man. Oh my God.
[Nizar] You look like a pop star, man.
- What is this?
- This is pop star.
[Emad] You look like refugee.
- Good to see you.
- I miss you.
- You look great. How are you?
- I'm good.
How's everything? How's everyone?
The others?
No, the others
were turned back at the border.
- What?
- There was nobody there to help us cross.
So we had to run,
and everybody split up.
I didn't see them again.
[Sara] God, that's awful.
[Emad] Yeah.
[social worker] Your asylum request
has now been registered.
You will receive a certificate
for temporary permission to reside
until your application has been processed.
That's it?
You don't have to ask questions?
Why we left Syria, anything?
You will be contacted
for an interview in a few months.
Yeah, but how long until we know
whether it's been successful or no?
We have a lot of people to process.
It's currently taking a year or two.
Yeah, but we need to apply also
for the family reunion.
My sister Yusra is still 17.
Yeah.
Your sister will be 18 in March.
That's not enough time.
We require a minimum of six months
for family reunion.
Yeah, but my younger sister
and my parents are still in Damascus.
It's very dangerous.
They have to come here.
Syria's being bombed.
I'm sorry.
Please.
There's nothing I can do.
[Sara] Yusra.
[Yusra sobbing]
[Sara] Yusra, please.
It's a processing thing.
So, they have to come the same way we did?
We should never have left.
I lost vital training.
My swimming is shit.
That's all you care about? Swimming?
[in Arabic] Think you're being selfish?
Selfish? I'm selfish?
Mama, Baba, and Shahed are in my heart.
I keep thinking about them.
But you don't, you just carry on.
You're reckless.
They're in danger now because of you.
- You can talk.
- What?
At least I have a goal.
What are you doing here?
You try to be cool
and waste your time partying.
I don't know you anymore.
You're not swimming.
You're not doing anything.
You're never going to achieve anything.
[Sven in English] Right, OK.
You missed the second turn.
Your frequency was too slow
in the last 25 meters. What's wrong?
Nothing.
- Sure?
- Yes.
OK. I wanted to tell you later,
but I have something
that will make you smile.
What?
I heard
the International Olympic Committee
gave a press conference, and they were
announcing help for refugee athletes.
They're forming a refugee team for Rio.
OK.
I sent them your times and told them
about your swim across the sea,
and, hey, if we work hard
and your times improve,
you can get onto the team.
[breathes deeply]
What?
If you had the chance,
would you want to compete
because you were good enough
or because people felt sorry for you?
I want to go to the Olympics
more than anything.
But when I go,
I will be there swimming for my country.
[Yusra] I'm sorry.
About what I said last night.
You meant it.
Not in the way I said it.
You're so soft on the outside.
So hard underneath.
But I kind of admire this about you.
I'm so happy you're swimming.
Sven called, by the way.
About the refugee team.
You should do it.
This was everything you ever wanted.
Not in the way I want it.
Yeah, but nothing has been
the way we wanted it.
Why would this be any different?
I want to swim for Syria.
No.
That's what Baba wanted.
Baba ever tell you
why he stopped swimming for Syria?
Military service.
He was actually very good.
At the beginning,
I thought it was an excuse, but it wasn't.
And he had to lose two years of training
just to carry a gun.
Life is not fair.
[sighs]
I'm Sara Mardini.
I have no country anymore.
This might be
the only opportunity of your life.
Look at me.
Don't be stupid. Take it.
[knocking at door]
Oh, I was looking for you.
I wanted to go to the Olympics
for Team Syria,
but if I can't,
I'd like to swim for Team Sven.
If you still want me to,
even though I'm stupid,
and I don't deserve it.
For 2020, we will train for Syria,
but for 2016, I'm Team Refugee.
We have a lot of work to do.
Ready?
[Ezzat in Arabic]
Tell me about your training.
[Yusra] Of course, Baba.
[Ezzat] I want you to describe
every detail.
The feeling underwater.
Every stroke, every move you make.
[in English] I want to know
what this German has done.
That was kind of "flop-flop."
No, you have to...
The head is too high. Focus on the elbow.
OK?
What was my time?
Sven?
What was my time?
- We're going to Rio.
- No.
- We're going to Rio.
- We're going to Rio?
[triumphant laugh]
We're going to Rio!
[both shrieking in excitement]
- Hey! We are going to Rio!
- [Yusra screams]
But I can't stop thinking about them.
I saw on Facebook that 100,000 people
had to cross the sea to Greece
in the last two months.
You know,
what we've been through isn't special.
Well...
What I saw on Facebook
was this place in Sonnenallee
run by this guy from Damascus.
He makes the same whipped ice cream
that he made back there.
We should try it.
[mother in Arabic] An Olympian,
my own daughter.
An Olympian, I don't believe it.
All that time at the poolside
wasn't for nothing.
It's good. It's as it should be.
And Sara? You didn't have the times?
Even for this refugee team?
No, Baba. I didn't.
"Refugee team"?
You say it like it doesn't count.
[conversation continues]
["Emta Njawzak Yamma" by DAM plays]
[song fades]
Nice tracksuit.
- [Yusra] What have you done?
- It's good at the back?
[Yusra] It's beautiful.
[Sara] I always wanted it short.
Look.
I wanna tell you something.
I've decided...
I'm going back to Lesbos.
[in Arabic] What?
[in English] I found this organization,
and I've been emailing them,
and they help everyone who's crossing.
- I want to be part of this.
- No, Sara, please.
We need to move on, go forward.
- What are you doing?
- I need to be there. To help everyone.
Give them water, shoes,
everything we didn't have.
You know, Mama, Shahed, Baba
will come the same way, maybe.
So you won't come with me to Rio?
Look, you were right.
I've never done anything with my life.
This is the first time I feel this.
Look, you can move on.
You can become an Olympian.
I can't.
This is the right thing for me.
[pop music plays faintly on the radio]
Nizar.
[Nizar] What's this?
[Yusra] I was going to wait
for your birthday.
Happy early birthday! [chuckles]
You remembered my birthday?
You're not allowed to give up.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
Maybe you are my favorite cousin.
I don't believe you.
You said this to Sara last week, so...
I think I'll get going.
I'll leave you prepare your stuff.
[in Arabic] Uh...
You've made us walk taller.
Don't worry about winning.
I am so proud of you.
Peace.
[in English] Bye.

[woman on PA] Next stop,

Welcome to Rio de Janeiro.
11,238 athletes from 207 nations
gathering to take part
in the Games of the 31st Olympiad,
the greatest sporting spectacle
in the world.
[Yusra] Thank you.
- What's that?
- I don't know!
[man] But one new team
has been generating a special buzz.
The Refugee Olympic Team.
- So, Yusra, welcome to Rio.
- Thank you.

#2016.
[man on PA] Welcome to the world-famous
Maracanã Stadium
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
for the opening ceremony.
[woman on PA] They have traveled
from all corners of the earth
and have spent a lifetime
training for this moment.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great moment has arrived.
[announcer] We welcome
the Refugee Olympic Team.
[people cheering and clapping]
[man on PA] A journey
that has taken the flame
all the way from Greece to Rio.

Sara!

Sara!

[breathes heavily]
[grunting]
[indistinct chatter]
I want to know, for everyone out there,
what's been your main motivation...
[girl 1] That's the Syrian girl
that's racing today.
[girl 2] I mean, I'm all for charity, but...
[girl 1] Exactly. The rest of us
had to work to be here.
[Yusra on TV] Yeah,
it's such an honor to be part of it.
It's a chance to be a voice
and to give hope.
[cheering in background]
[phone beeps]
Hi.
[Sara] So, aren't you
about to swim your race?
- Yes.
- What are you doing sitting on your ass?
How do you...
[Sara speaks Arabic]
[Yusra screeches]
I can't believe you're here!
This is crazy!
Sister.
[Yusra squeals]
How did you get here?
I contacted the sponsor
of the refugee team,
and I told them that I was the sister
of the world-famous Yusra Mardini.
- And I even flew business class.
- What?!
- We were in economy.
- I don't fly economy, habibi.
[chuckles]
- And what about Lesbos?
- I'm gonna go straight after.
I wanna show you something.
[in Arabic] Good luck, my love.
I'm not worried because you're lucky.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Remember everything I've taught you.
Yalla, Shahed.
I hope you win.
[in English] Good luck, Yusra.
We love you. We miss you.
[speaking in Arabic]
So grown-up!
[Shada] Good luck.
[Sara] Actually, I didn't really
wanna show you this one.
[Yusra] Why? Is she back in Eritrea?
Hm.
Is she safe?
[sighs]
[distant cheering]
I heard other swimmers talking.
They said I shouldn't be here.
They said I don't deserve it.
Well, they're right. You shouldn't.
You should be
at the bottom of the Greek sea.
Or sleeping on the roadside of Hungaria.
Or you should be dead
in a hole in Dariyya.
I just wanna be a swimmer.
You know Olympians are people
who are supposed to do amazing things.
Don't do that.
Remember what Baba used to say?
"Find your lane. Swim your race."
It's all bullshit.
[man on PA] Please welcome
the athletes in heat one
of the women's 100m butterfly.
[Sara] You should swim for all of us.
- [loud cheering]
- [air horns sounding]
[Sara] You should swim for Baba
because he didn't.
Swim for me
because I couldn't.
Swim for Sven because he couldn't.
Swim for Shada.
Swim for Razan Haddad.
[man on PA] Swimming for Qatar
in lane two, Nada Arakji.
And for everyone who died
trying to find a new life.
Swim for them.
[man on PA] Swimming in lane three
for Rwanda, Johanna Umurungi.
You're so much more than an Olympian.

Yusra Mardini.
