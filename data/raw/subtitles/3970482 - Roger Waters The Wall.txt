I would like
to dedicate this concert
to him
and to all the other
victims of state terror
everywhere, all over the world.
When I was young myself
We played in London.
We filmed some shows there.
I have a small piece of film here tonight.
And this... ah?
...is a clip of me singing the song Mother.
I will try to sing a double track vocal
and play the acoustic guitar
with that poor, miserable,
fucked up little Roger
from all those years ago.
So!
Wish us luck!
Good luck!
