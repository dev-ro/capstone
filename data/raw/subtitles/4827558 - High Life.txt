All right, all quiet.
Da-da!
I'm here, honey.
Da-da.
What you doin', Willow?
Da-da! Da!
Da!
Da-da.
Yeah?
What you doin', Willow?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Mmm.
Mmm, mmm-hmm.
One, two, three.
Hey...
There you go.
There you go.
Do a little pee-pee.
There you go.
There you go.
Aw...
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Hey.
Shh. Hey.
All done.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything's okay.
Here, bubba.
Who's this?
Don't drink
your own piss, Willow.
And don't eat your own shit.
Even if it's recycled...
...even if it doesn't
look like piss or shit
anymore.
It's called a taboo.
Ta-boo.
Ta... Boo.
Hang thee, my little baggage.
Man.
Ah!
Taboo.
Taboo.
Taboo.
Taboo.
At least it is for me.
But not for you.
Not for you.
Not for you.
Sweet little girl.
If my old man
could see me now...
"Break the laws of nature,
"and you'll pay for it...
"...you little
son of a bitch.
"You little son of a bitch."
Wait for me.
Wait!
Come on!
Hey,
wait for me!

ID 149 reporting.
I removed the defective section
of the external magnetic panel
and replaced it with
one of my own making.
To save electric energy,
I've decided to jettison
everything that's unnecessary.
I'm fully aware
of the consequences.
The child's in good health
and, uh, so am I.
My blood work is normal,
my eyesight is stable.
And, oh, even if I don't
see me play this message
for 100 years, fuck you.
Over and out.
So light, Mink.
It's barely even here.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
No.
So many tears
in just a tiny little body.
Would you stop it, please?
Please, please,
stop it, stop it, please.
Please. It's gonna kill me.
It's gonna kill me.
It's gonna kill me.
Please.
Okay?
Hey.
Hmm.
Hmm. Hmm.
I'm afraid, Willow.
Mmm, I could've just
drowned you like a kitten.
It'd be so easy.
It should be you first
and then me.
These fucking
images from Earth.
I can't believe
they still make it here.
After all this time.
Just like
viruses chasing after us.
Parasites.
I'm holding up.
I've held up.
I never caved in.
I'll hold up.
She's mine.
I'm hers.
Fuck.
Since we left
the solar system,
radio silence.
Nothing.
Those random images.
Maybe they were programmed
to keep us on a leash.
Make us believe
a return was possible.
We invented rituals.
Hygiene first.
Here.
Kali Yuga, the final...
The final age of man.
Did you know that
I still have leopards
on the street where I live?
Professor, I'm surprised
you've accepted an invitation
to attend a conference
in such a cold country.
What made you leave your
Assamese hills and say yes?
Curiosity.
But you have a more serious
reason for coming, don't you?
Yes.
Yes, indeed.
Radical experiments are
taking place in outer space.
Death row inmates are selected
to be used as guinea pigs.
Is this really how Occidental
governmental authorities
hope to deal with criminals?
I doubt very much.
I mean, they're not being
told the truth about...
About what?
That they will never come back.
We can't even contact them.
Their messages and reports
now take years
to get back to us.
We'll be bone dust
while they're still
hurtling through space.
Yep.
Right.
Oh. Yeah!
All right.
Yep.
Whoop!
Okay.
Aw.
Almost.
Up, up.
Come on.
Up.
Up.
Up. Up. Up.
Da!
We were scum. Trash.
Refuse that didn't
fit into the system
until someone had the
bright idea of recycling us.
Some of us got life sentences,
some of us were on death row.
The agency made us an offer,
to serve science.
Given our ages,
how could we say no?
At that point,
we'd only left the solar system
for three years.
Almost all of us
were still alive.
Constant acceleration
creates artificial gravity,
freeing us from the discomfort
of weightlessness.
The body handles it better.
I don't want a sedative.
You put too much
in the water as it is.
Well, you got me, juicy peach.
They lied to us
and you knew it.
You knew it.
Fucking second-chance doctor.
When I first saw you, you were
a filthy little crackhead.
Now look at you.
A fine specimen.
Fucking child murderer.
Oh, so you do have
a nervous system.
Eh! Look at her!
Look at her!
You're fucking killing her!
Whoa! Calm down!
Don't you realize nothing is
ever gonna grow inside of us?
Oh! Behavior!
Fuck off!
Fucking whore.
Hey. Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, uh-uh-uh. Hey.
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.
Hey.
Hey. Uh-uh.
Hey. Mmm-mmm.
It's dirty.
It's dirty.
Mmm.
Hmm.
It's a fresh strawberry.
Hey.
Ah.
Hey.
Ah.
Mmm!
Ready?
Hold on tight.
Hold on tight.
Come here.
Hey. Come on. Hey.
Dr. Dibs,
struggling to harvest
healthy fetuses,
ones that would
survive childbirth.
The guys were in it
for the fix.
What about my treat?
Oh.
Smashing.
Thank you.
Why do you keep
taking their sperm?
Even if you manage to
inseminate one of the girls,
the babies die
from radiation.
The odds
are not in our favor,
but when my work
is accomplished,
when perfection is achieved...
Then what?
Fly away?
Except for me.
I kept my fluids to myself.
She thought she was
doing me a favor.
Someday.
She was cocky that way.
Doesn't seem to be
doing you much good.
Better than you'd think.
God,
it's so humiliating.
You need to wipe your nose.
I know I look like a witch.
I mean, you all call me
Vultura, right?
'Cause you're foxy
and you know it.
I just don't understand
how you can still believe
in your Class-2 mission.
It's like you've become
a shaman of sperm.
It's just a new
religion for you.
Because I'm totally devoted
to reproduction,
happy monk.
Going to sow your fields?
Fucking cock-block.
Like everyone,
I'd used the box,
but as time passed, I chose
abstinence over indulgence.
Chastity was a way
of making myself stronger.
Mr. Blue Nuts.
This monk thing
you got goin' on,
it's cool, huh?
It's so vain.
You bet I'm vain.
I like it here.
This reminds me of juvie.
Reminds me of jail.
It's the same thing
as the army.
I get why
you choose abstinence.
Masturbating, you can...
You can do that to death.
But this fuck box?
Jesus.
That's a whole 'nother
rabbit hole.
You use it.
I made my wife promise
to raise our son gently.
Only thing that makes me happy
is knowing he's gonna be
all right.
Your son is old now,
or he's dead.
This little garden
is teaching me
to enjoy the present.
Nothin' else
really matters, man.
And Tcherny can't be
your real name, right?
Nah. One of the Russian crew
instructors gave it to me.
I think it means black,
but who knows, man?
What's Monte?
Your folks Italian
or somethin'?
Nah.
I was raised by my dog.
I'm tired as a bat,
all this flying around.
I can't do this
space shit no more.
At 99%
of the speed of light,
the entire sky converged
before our eyes.
This sensation,
moving backwards even though
we're moving forwards,
getting farther
from what's getting nearer,
sometimes
I just can't stand it.
According to Dibs,
the captain is ill-equipped
for the stress.
Bad genes.
Leukemia has invaded his body.
His eyes are more sensitive
to the radiation than ours.
Everything he sees
is bathed in a black halo.
I have good genes.
All right.
Fuck off.
Be careful with her!
Yes.
We were
at the halfway point.
Four more years
to our destination.
We had to begin
the deceleration maneuver
so the ship could
approach a black hole,
one of the closest
in our galaxy.
A small one.
This is the main goal
of our mission.
Our Class-1 suicide ride
to check if we could capture
a black hole's rotating energy.
And we, heroes,
would provide humanity with
almost boundless resources.
Their Penrose process.
I want to fuck you.
It stinks.
The usual stench.
It gets me hard.
Tcherny decided to start
sleeping in the garden.
I'm glad I'm so weak.
I'm so happy I'm hemorrhaging.
Be quiet.
Stop lying to yourself.
One day, it'll happen to you.
You're not as strong
as you think you are,
big booty girl.
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?
Okay.
- Because you're so...
- Shut the fuck up!
Don't shush me.
- You're so fucking annoying.
- Shh!
Sometimes
I look at you
and I wanna beat your face
into a little pulp.
Your little mouth,
your stupid smile...
That voice.
Hey, stop doing that.
You'll hurt yourself.
Douching is for amateurs.
Do we need to tie you up again?
Come on, go back to sleep.
Good.
God damn slut.
You're a bunch of common
criminals and petty thugs.
My crime was the only one
worthy of the name.
Even up here,
the black ones
are the first to go.
Are you sick?
You wanna clog the machine?
Is that what you want?
- It's what she wanted.
- Don't do that!
You're sick!
- It's all good then!
- Ow!
Don't ever do that again!
Step away.
Fuck your baby mission!
Your hormones
are fucking bullshit.
It's our willpower
that kills the fetuses.
It's a stroke.
Don't tell anyone.
Shit, the report.
He was fucked.
- Maybe we were fucked too.
- It's okay.
The mission.
Everything.
ID 149,

in full-functional mode,

No one to put me

I live alone with my guilt.
Hmm? What?
What?
What?
Suck my dick.
Please.
Shh.
Fuck off!
- Get off me!
- Hey, what are you doing?
Fucking get off me!
Stop it, you fucker! Stop it!
Help, help!
Get off her!
You sick fuck!
No!
No! No!
No!
Come on!
Help!
No!
Shut the fuck up!
Hey, hey!
Help!
Come on! Take these off!
He broke my nose!
- Come on.
- I will kill that motherfucker.
Fuck outta here.
Come on.
Fucking...
Fucking walk!
Won't you carry me?
Please!
No! No...
Not so easy to get
inside you, is it?
My body obeys me.
Okay, that's good.
I'll never have kids.
I'm sure of it.
Okay, breathe.
Did you really kill
your own kids?
You suffocated them?
In their little beds,
with their little pillows?
And your husband?
With a knife.
I would've killed myself.
I tried.
Explains
your plastic pussy.
Dibs increased the dose
when she wanted us
at her mercy.
We'd all hit the wall
and dropped like flies,
sleep for hours.
Sleep.
I'm the pilot.
You cannot make me sleep.
Sleep.
You smell so good.
Monte.
Maybe it's because you never
wanted anything from me.
I'm allowed to have you now.
Why don't you ever take me
in your arms?
Hmm?
If I close my eyes,
I know I'm gonna feel you inside.
I know.
I almost can feel it.
Yes.
Fill me.
Fill me, Monte.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There.
Yes.
Crawl inside, my baby.
Crawl inside.
Crawl inside.
Crawl, crawl,
crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
My baby.
They got me.
They got me.
Hey.
Yes.
My good baby.
Yes.
Come on.
Hey.
Go on, get out.
- I hate that bed.
- Go on. Hey.
Go back to your own bunk.
Come on.
Come on! You're too heavy now.
Come on.
Crazy girl.
It's too far.
Bums and losers,
that's what you are.
I found all your records.
You killed your friend
over a dog.
Yeah.
I'm crazy, girl.
Do I detect a farewell
in your eyes?
You're a skilled pilot.
None of the rest of us
could do this.
You made your choice.
Why are you crying?
I'm moved.
I have to stay alone now.
Where are you going?
To the garden.
That's not Nansen.
That's not Nansen.
It's Boyse.
Fuck!
That child is your daughter,
born of your genes.
She's strong-made.
Like her big-booty mother.
For me, she's perfection.
"I'd rather
sink into the Earth
"after I've lost you
than to sit around and grieve
"once you've gone off
into your destiny."
What are you talkin' about?
It's what my wife told me.
I told her I was doing
all this for her and our son,
to turn our shame into
some type of glory, you know?
She says that this mission
was like burying her twice
and that my idea of glory
was bullshit.
There's no response.
Looks like ours.
It's the same.
It's the same ship.
There might be, uh,
other people, um,
on board.
So?
What?
They might be able
to help us.
We don't need help.
Are you scared?
- No.
- No?
No.
Are you sure?
Are those dogs?
Yeah.
Do you have the baby dog?
I had to leave it.
Why didn't you take it?
We could've kept it.
We couldn't have kept it.
I wanted a dog so bad.
A little dog to hold.
You know why.
Just step away from the door,
it wasn't clean in there.
I gotta disinfect,
I gotta clean myself.
It'll die in there.
It's cruelty!
What do you know
about cruelty?
You don't know anything
about it.
I need to clean,
I need to disinfect myself.
Move away from the door!
Move away from the door!
Get out.
You were right, Dad.
You were right.
I'm sorry.
I have everything I need here.
Just go up, peanut.
What're you doin'?
Praying.
You know a god to pray to?
What god are you praying to?
I saw it in some
of the random images from Earth.
I just wanted to know
what they feel.
Time to feed the dog.
ID 149.
Local day 6750.
Earth days 76861.
Looks like
a crocodile's eye.
More like a mouth
that wants to swallow us up.
It's so big.
We should try it.
I can feel it.
Oh, you can feel it?
I thought we were
supposed to be drifters.
But it's so big.
I'm sure the density
is very low.
I believe in this one.
I'm sad that you deleted
all your data.
Even your prison records.
You might've been
thugs and criminals,
but you're heroes to me.
It'll all be destroyed
by the firewall
once the ship gets sucked
into the black hole anyway.
There is no firewall.
I know it.
We'll make it through.
You always
avoid my questions.
Do I look like my mother?
No.
Take a good look.
My eyes?
No.
My hair?
No, not at all.
My nose? My mouth?
You have rodent teeth.
You're a little rat.
Rats are incredibly
intelligent animals.
Am I weird-looking?
You're special.
So different.
You're like no one else.
And I love that.
Shall we?
Yes.
