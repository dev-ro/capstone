Momy, is this the house of Hansel and Gretel?
Yes, Gabriela, it can be. 
Where is the Witch?
Don't - Move!
Es tan facil caer
Cuando tu quieres
Es tan facil perder
Toda razon
Cuando los dias pasan
Y sigues sin poder ver
Porque grande
Es la mentira
Y tanto lo que te ven
Salta Carmela
Que el barco va a naufragar
Salta Carmela
Que asi no puedo esperar
Pero el cielo puede esperar
Aha
Es tan facil subir
Cuando tu quieres
Es tan facil pedir
Una razon
Cuando tus ojos brillan
Y sigues sin contestar
Porque buscas una salida
Y te vuelves a equivocar
Salta Carmela
- Que el barco va a naufragar
- Salta
Salta Carmela
{Y:i}Que el cielo puede esperar
Que el cielo puede esperar
Y si tus ojos brillan
Me pueden encandilar
Me pueden hacer matar
Oh, oah
Salta Carmela
Que el barco va a naufragar
Salta Carmela
Que el cielo puede esperar
El cielo puede esperar¤¤¤
{Y:i}
{Y:i}cut his head!
{Y:i}cut his head!
Bring it to the floor!
I have no guilt!
No! No!
Listen! Listen!
- Ahh-ooh!
- Ooh!
- Adventure? Hah!
We have to clean the bathroom!
- Siii!
You think this is fun?
{Y:i}Ay, caramba. Que sticky is that.
Isn't Tuscany the most romantic
place in the world?
That's where I wanted you to take
me more than anyware, you know?
That charmy little village you
always talked about outside of Venice?
You remember, don't you?
Venice? I mean Florence!
Of course! Florence!
{Y:i}Ah, Firenze.
Then maybe we could go for a little
stay up in the Alps
What was the name of
that resort you always
wanted to take me to?
Zore's, I think?
I was so looking forward
to going.
Skiing al day.
Dropping down
the black diamonds.
We could have stayed in one
of those cozy challets, tucked away
deep in the black bars
It would have been perfect.
With your money we could have
spent the rest of our lives in the Alpes.
{Y:i}Of course I'd have to learn
how to ski first.
We could build a fire.
Nobody else around.
I would make love to you...
The way you like it.
Remember?
Mmmm.
And while you're lying me,
you'd say to me...
Please, please, Paul.
Please, no.
I don't know,
I don't know!
No, no, no, no, no.
Look at me.
Please, look at me.
It's ok, look at me.
It's ok, look at me.
Don't stop looking at me.
No, no, no, please, no!
What do you say?
{Y:i}"From Dusk Till Down"
will return after these messages!
{Y:i}Miami. Over 50,000
violent crimes a year.
{Y:i} Have you or someone you know
been victim of a sudden random
violent crime?
{Y:i}You've dealt with the fear,
you've dealt with the pain.
{Y:i}Now, how do you
deal with the aftermath?
{Y:i}The unique challange of violent crime clean up
is ours specially.
{Y:i}Our trained professionals are
fast, clean and sensitive.
{Y:i}We service hotels, 
offices, restaurants, schools...
{Y:i}homes, automobiles and boats.
At "PFCS"
Satisfaction is guaranteed.
{Y:i}
{Y:i}Tell 555-0137.
{Y:i}At "PFCS" you suffer less
while we take care of the mess!
{Y:i}Next, the blood blood
killer, only on "Miami D.O.A."
{Y:i}Grace!
{Y:i}Grace!
{Y:i}Did you tell that guy at the Gables Club
we could clean up thatjob in two hours?
{Y:i}Yeah.
- Two hours?
{Y:i}Look, Grace, now they're
on the phone bitchin'at me...
{Y:i}because Lourdes and Eva
have been over there all day and
they're not even half done yet.
{Y:i}I know, but Lourdes said
she could do it in two hours.
{Y:i}Well, she always says
she can do it quicker.
{Y:i}Grace, that victim
was hacked to pieces.
{Y:i}Look at the numbers that
I write on the order, okay?
Okay, I won't
listen to Lourdes.
{Y:i}- Who are you?
- This is Gabriela for a job.
- We didn't have an ad, did we?
- No.
Hi.
Come on up.
{Y:i}So, have you had a job
like this before?
Yes. I used to clean up
in a bakery.
{Y:i}The floors, the pans,
the ovens.
Bakery.
You know, uh, what...
one of these places looks like?
Yes.
- Ever seen one?
- Mm-hmm. From pictures.
[ Chuckles ]
You can look at pictures all day.
We have a wall full
of pictures you can look at.
{Y:i}But until you get into the really
rough stuff,you don't know anything.
The blood gets curdled.
Smells like
you wouldn't believe.
Curdled?
The first time,
you lose your lunch. It's automatic.
{Y:i}Happens to everybody.
Then when you run into...
a really out-of-control one,
like this, uh, Blue Blood guy--
{Y:i}He goes around, stabs 'em
over and over again.
Then he pins 'em down
and... cuts off their head...
clean as a whistle.
{Y:i}I tell ya, it's
not pretty to look at.
No. No.
- You're not a gore hound, are ya?
- What do you mean?
Somebody that gets off
lookin' at blood and guts.
I don't want anybody
like that around here.
No, I'm not like that.
I'd be a little afraid of going into one
of those places just like most people.
Weren't you afraid
your first time?
[ Chuckles ]
Well, the season's comin' up.
- I might be shorthanded.
- The season?
August. I sometimes have to turn
people away in August.
And after Christmas?
Yeah, it's busy too.
[ Giggles ]
[ Laughs ]
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna take a chance on you.
Thank you.
- Uh, what did you say your name was?
- Gabriela.
Gabriela, yeah. Don't think I was
just tryin' to scare you to death.
- I just wanted you to
know the whole picture.
- I know. Thank you.
[ Both Laugh ]
{Y:i}[ Indistinct Singing ]
How are you?
{Y:i}[ Woman ]
I'm just fine.
I like your dress.
It's elegant.
Paul...
Richard's moving
back in next week.
- Really?
- So we just have to stop.
That would make sense.
You know how great
this has been for me?
For me, as well.
{Y:i}Paul!
[ Clears Throat ]
I'll be one minute.
Paulie, I need a chablis and a MacAllan
with a splash of water.
How was your weekend?
Nice, thanks.
Mine was great.
We went spearfishing down in Key Largo.
{Y:i}We got a bunch of grouper,
some hogfish.
You really oughta go
next time.
Sounds nice.
Would you like for me
to come over tomorrow night?
I don't think that would be
a very good idea.
[ Whispers ]
What's one more time?
And then that's it?
And then that's it.

{Y:i}[ Doorbell Rings ]
{Y:i}- [ Indistinct ]
- Hi. Come in.
I just have to finish
something in the kitchen.
Sit down.
[ Giggles ]
Oh. I-I came by to give you
your last paycheck.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Uh,just put it on the desk.
- Is this your scrapbook?
- Eduardo!
{Y:i}Oh! I saw this one
on the news.
- He cuts off their heads.
- Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Why do you keep all these?
I'm curious about
how these things happen.
[ Both Laugh ]
It helps when you try
to understand.
But these never really
tell you how it happens.
They only help a little.
{Y:i}- [ Timer Dings ]
- Oh. One second.
I have to go
pick up my sister.
But, uh, I--
I just dropped by...
so I could make sure
that you got your last check.
Okay. This one's
for you.
- Ohh! Oh!
- [ Giggles ]
It looks like me.
[ Laughs ]
Mmm. Thanks.
Um...
do you want to do
something this week?
Maybe, uh, maybe
we can have dinner?
That would be nice. You mean
at a restaurant or here or we could--
Do you cook?
- I could make dinner for us.
- [ Laughs ]
- Um, okay, is-- is Thursday okay?
- Thursday's good.
- Okay. Oh, yeah.
- Eight o'clock.
Okay. Um...
good-bye, Gabriela.
- Good-bye. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.
[ Both Laugh ]
Bye-bye.
{Y:i}[ Gasping, Groaning ]
[ Gasping, Groaning Continue ]
{Y:i}[ Water Running ]
{Y:i}You know, France must be one of
the most romantic places in the world.
{Y:i}What was the name of that vineyard
in Bordeaux you were telling me about?
You know, that one where you
stay in that little chalet?
- What are you doing?
- [ Straining ]
What the hell
are you doing?
[ Gasps ]
Look what you've done.
Look what you've done.
Shit!
[ Grunts ]
Shit!
- [ Squeaking ]
-Jesus!
Shit.
Shit!
Shit.
{Y:i}Christ!
{Y:i}[ Clattering, Chattering ]
{Y:i}[ Man Knocking ]
Hello? Katrina?
{Y:i}- Katrina?
- [ Grunts ]
{Y:i}[ Chattering Continues ]
{Y:i}[ Man ]
Katrina,you all right?
{Y:i}Hello?
{Y:i}[ Door Closes ]
{Y:i}Well, let's
get to it, people.
{Y:i}Well, let's
get to it, people.
All right, everybody,
let's gather around...
see what we've got
here today.
Yes. Oh, yeah,
Buenos Aires Apartments.
You know, over in the Grove.
Nonfatal shooting to the head.
Terrazzo floor.
Um, it's uh--
that's just down Bay Shore...
from that barbecue joint
we went to on Clara's birthday.
{Y:i}- You remember?
- [ Together ] Yeah.
- Okay, who wants that?
- Okay.
Try to get everything,
will ya, Eva? All right...
this is, uh, on Biscayne, point-blank
execution-type scenario, parquet floor.
We'll do it.
No, I wanna give you
an easy one today, okay?
Here, you take this one.
Oh, you know what?
I remember this building from last year.
- These people tried
to come in and look.
- Came in the building?
Yeah, they just wanted
to watch. It was weird.
{Y:i}All right, then,
Miami Beach.
A bludgeoning. It's a tile floor.
There's not much to it.
Here, you take this.
{Y:i}- That's it.
- [ Chattering ]
All right, this says what's there
so we know what we need.
{Y:i}If it gets really bad,
he makes a diagram of the rooms...
- with everything marked, right?
- Okay.
No, not that one.
- This one.
- No, no, this one.
What's the difference, Eva?
They're the same thing.
This is your outfit.
If you behave yourself,
he'll put your name on it.
Okay? All right.
Now, when it's bloody...
[ Clicks Tongue ] right in there.
Gabriela...
if you get out there and
find that you can't do this...
don't be afraid
to say something.
- This is not for everybody.
- I know. Thank you.
You stick with Elena.
She'll show you...
how to get those floors so clean
you can eat off of'em.
Come on, let me show you
where the vans are in the back.
Hurry up, Eva!
Come on!
Oh, no, no.
You carry it.
- No. Look at me.
I can't carry everything.
- No. No, you carry it.
- You want to take
that gallon, you carry it.
- No.
{Y:i}[ Dog Barking ]
{Y:i}[ Car Passing ]
Let's get goin'.
Give me a hand.
How long have you worked
for Mr. Roger?
Since I moved down
from Orlando. Six years.
Orlando.
I know Orlando.
- Oh, yeah? What were you there for?
- Disney World.
When my mother and my sister
and my nieces came up from Colombia.
- Yeah?
- It was wonderful.
Everybody there
was having a good time.
Children, old people.
Do you like Epcot
or the Magic Kingdom?
Epcot, I guess.
I like the Magic Kingdom.
Come here.
Did you work on any
of the Blue Blood jobs?
Yep. One.
When?
The first one. And
I don't wanna do any more.
- Why?
- The bonus isn't worth it.
On-- On the one
that you did do...
what did he do to her?
What?
[ Chuckles ]
He killed her.
Where was she?
In the bedroom.
Where?
On the floor, in front of the mirror.
Look, I don't want to get into this.
He chopped off her head
in front of the mirror?
Maybe he wanted
to look at himself.
Look, I don't want to talk about this,
uh, sicko mass murderer, okay?
No, no,
he's a serial killer.
A mass murderer goes into Burger Mundo
or someplace and kills everybody.
[ Chuckles ]
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.
{Y:i}[ Door Opens, Footsteps ]
Gabriela, wait!
Don't do anything.
Just stand there and let me show you.
{Y:i}I don't want you
smearing it, okay?
I always get rid
of this first.
{Y:i}[ Shaking Can ]
- Scrubbing bubbles.
- You don't scrub with this.
Just with cleanser.
{Y:i}[ Scrubbing ]
She was reaching
for something, maybe.
- What?
- She was reaching for something.
{Y:i}- He-- Put that down! Please.
- But look!
Sorry.
[ Sighs ]
Gabriela, look.
You're gonna have to start
listening to me, okay?
I heard. You don't scrub
until you use the cleanser.
No, you're gonna
have to watch me...
because you are gonna have
to learn how to do this, okay?
I'm watching.
{Y:i}[ Woman ]
Here on Miami D.O.A....
it's been our responsibility
to do profiles...
on many of our nation's
most notorious criminals...
mass murderers
and serial killers...
of the past, recent past
and right this minute.
{Y:i}Richard Speck, killer
of eight nurses in one night.
{Y:i}Julio Gonzales...
{Y:i}armed with a dollar's worth
of gasoline and two matches...
{Y:i}killed 87 people.
{Y:i}We went to Texas to bring you
the up-to-the-minute story...
{Y:i}of Seth and Richard Gecko,
the bank robbing brothers...
{Y:i}who killed, kidnapped
and raped their way...
{Y:i}across Missouri and Texas...
{Y:i}only to vanish,
seemingly into thin air.
But for some of our viewers...
this episode will hit
a little too close to home.
Because tonight, we profile
the reign of terror...
of Miami's
Blue Blood Killer...
a reign of terror
that seems far from over.
The Blue Blood Killer.
For Miami residents, it may seem
like this carnivorous hunter
has been playing...
his most dangerous of dangerous
games for a lifetime.
But in actual fact, it was
only three months ago...
that the Blue Blood Killer
declared hunting season...
on the wealthy ladies
of our fair city open.
{Y:i}Gloria Venarsdale...
{Y:i}owner of the popular
Miami night spot, Bingo Bongo...
{Y:i}carries the distinction of being the
first slain by the Blue Blood Killer.
{Y:i}Jamiejacks,
39-year-old daughter...
{Y:i}of borscht belt funny man
Pauliejacks...
{Y:i}seen here holding
littlejamie, was the second.
{Y:i}Clothing designer and fashion
impresario, Marie Clamant...
{Y:i}was the most prominent victim.
{Y:i}And finally, Katrina Brandt...
{Y:i}owner of a successful chain
of gourmet food stores...
{Y:i}became the latest woman to quench
the killer's thirst for blue blood.
I'm standing outside
the home of Katrina Brandt.
We managed to find passage
inside the scene of the crime.
{Y:i}Strangely, the killer
changed his modus operandi...
{Y:i}of slicing off his victim's head
with Miss Brandt.
{Y:i}The gourmet food entrepreneur
was found with her head...
{Y:i}clearly on her shoulders.
{Y:i}[ TV Clicks Off]
Here, smell.
Seven bucks at Perfumania.
You wear this to work?
Well, I don't smell the chemicals so
much when I put this stuff on, you know?
And, yeah, I wear it
when I go out sometimes.
You should try it
next time you go on a date.
- You got a boyfriend?
- No.
- What do you mean, no?
- Well, there is this guy...
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- who's a friend from the bakery.
And... now you think
he's more interesting?
- Yes.
- Uh-huh. [ Laughs ]
{Y:i}- [ Roger ] Lourdes?
- What?
Did you do an idiot check before you
left that shotgun job yesterday?
- Why?
- I-I checked around.
{Y:i}Mm-hmm. Did you look under
the table in the dining room?
It wasn't in that part.
{Y:i}- [ Shouting In Spanish ]
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Eva!
It was a 1 2-gauge shotgun.
{Y:i}You gotta expect some of it
to get across the room.
Now, the victim's wife
just called.
She found a couple of skull
fragments under the dining room
table that y'all missed.
That's a complete refund.
Not only is it a refund...
think about the customer,
for heaven's sake.
{Y:i}You gotta back each other up.
You gotta practice
a little teamwork.
It's like when I was
in the coroner's office.
I had to, uh, move
this 300-pound corpse.
Two cops standin' around sayin',
"Not my job. Not my job"
[ Mutters, Scoffs ]
Well, I tried to move
that whale myself.
Whack! Out goes my back.
Bye-bye, coroner's office.
All because two clock-watchin'
slack-asses...
did not understand
the concept of teamwork.
Now, the point is, we've all got
to watch out for each other out there.
- You understand?
- Don't worry, we will.
Here, uh, file that under
the "Blue Blood," will ya?
{Y:i}Come on, Eva, let's go. I can't believe
you didn't see a piece of skull.
{Y:i}- I looked, I swear.
- A piece of skull, Eva.
{Y:i}We're talking about a piece of skull.
How can you not see a piece of skull?
{Y:i}It blended
with the flooring.
{Y:i}- The skull?
- No... [ Indistinct ]
{Y:i}[ Knocking ]
Roger? You wanted me?
Oh, hello, Elena.
Come on in.
I need to ask your opinion
about Gabriela.
She didn't lose it out there
or anything, did she?
No... she didn't.
You don't think she's one
of these gore freaks, do you?
I don't think so. She's just...
sort of weird, you know?
Like a little girl.
She acts like a little girl.
{Y:i}[ Doorbell Rings ]
I'm coming!
- Hi. [ Giggles ]
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?
- Okay.
- Good.
- Um--
- Ohhh. [ Laughs ]
I brought it
for your scrapbook.
See, it's, uh,
the man on the boat in Biscayne Bay.
- Uh-huh.
- I don't know if you
already have this one.
- You probably have it.
- No, no, I don't. Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Uh, dinner's almost ready.
Oh! Oh, pardon.
- Whoa.
[ Laughing ]
Come on in.
{Y:i}I love bakeries.
When I was little, I practically
lived in my mother's bakery.
It was beautiful. It had this
really smooth wooden floor....
{Y:i}and these long, long cases full
of cakes and pies and pastries.
It smelled so good.
I remember exactly
what it smelled like.
I wish you would come back
and work with us.
{Y:i}We miss you.
I bet I could get you
your job back!
- No.
- No, really.
I'm sure if I talked to her,
she would take you back.
I want to tell you
about my new job.
What new job?
- Promise you won't think I'm weird?
- What is it?
- I'm a maid.
- A maid?
{Y:i}It's not like a regular
maid company. It's different.
{Y:i}Well, what do you mean?
I mean, 'cause you clean up
chemicals or something?
No. Because we clean up
after murders.
What? You clean up
the bodies?
Not the body.
Just the blood and stuff.
- Ohh.
- Are you sure you want to hear this?
Yeah. Um...
is that all you do?
Yes.
God!
I thought you might
be interested.
- Doesn't it bother you at all?
- There is no body there.
-Just the outline.
- But there's blood and everything.
Yes. You can really
see how it happened.
You can see exactly
how it happened.
Whew! I don't think
I could do that.
Aren't you curious?
Yes, but--
Do you think you're
gonna keep working there?
Yes. Uh-huh.
Gabriela, have you ever heard
of that band Los Musicos de Breva?
Yes, with the singer
who looks like Andy Garcia.
Yeah. They're playing
at El Cid tomorrow.
Do you wanna go?
Tomorrow night?
Yes.
- Yes, I'd love to go.
- Oh, perfect.
Uh... I'll come by
at 9:30.
- Okay, that sounds good.
- Okay? Okay.
- We'll have fun.
- Yes, I'll look forward to it.
Okay. So,
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- [ Giggles ]
- Thanks for dinner.
You're welcome.
Oh, don't forget.
{Y:i}Oh! Good night,
Gabriela.
Good night. Bye.
{Y:i}[ Door Closes ]
For all of you.
For all of you.
What's this?
Oh, thanks.
Look at this.
Ay, you tryin'
to fatten us all up?
{Y:i}What is it?
My God, these look so good.
{Y:i}[ Eva ]
How'd that execution thing go?
- Oh, my God. Disgusting!
- That man lives like a pig.
The only good thing about the place was,
the guy's brother--
he let us in--
he was really good looking.
- Yeah? [ Laughs ]
- He was okay.
Oh, come on, he was not
just okay. I saw you looking.
[ Laughing ]
{Y:i}I don't like those
execution jobs,you know?
Just to think that
somebody was sitting there...
knowing they're about to get killed--
those are so bad.
Once I heard that in France when they
cut off the head with the guillotine--
this is strange--
when the head was cut off...
the head knew it was cut off
for some seconds, and sometimes
it said some words.
- What?
- Yes.
And the people who watched
all wanted to see if they could talk.
So they held them up.
Just something like, help!
- Oh, Gabriela!
- Gabriela.
- I'm not making it up.
-Just a head without a body
couldn't talk.
- The brain could still think.
- This is sick.
Not all of the heads talked.
Only some.
Well, I'd say, "Fuck you
for chopping off my head."
{Y:i}- [ Laughing ]
- Maybe they could all talk...
{Y:i}but they didn't feel like it after
going through something like that.
Yes. It's curious.
Think about what they would say.
All right, let's quit joyin'
about who said what, and get
down today's assignments.
Okay, don't be mad.
{Y:i}Here we go again.
[ Sighs ] They're ready for us
at that Blue Blood job.
We'll do it.
Roger, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.
We can do this.
- Clara,Joan, it's yours.
- [ Scoffs ]
Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
You promised me.
You promised her.
No more Blue Blood.
Look, I'll double the bonus.
- Eva?
- It's double.
No, no, no.
Don't look at me.
Forget it. I'd only clean
that house if it was Fidels.
{Y:i}No, no. Forget it.
No, no. No way.
Don't worry.
I can do this.
{Y:i}I really can use the money.
It's double.
No, we're not gonna do it.
Forget it. I'm not gonna do it.
Let that little girl do it.
Look, this is not some guy
that got mad at his wife and
stabbed her a couple of times.
This guy stabbed a woman
20 odd times...
{Y:i}watched her crawl around bleedin'
to death, then he cut offher head.
- He didn't chop off her head this time.
- Never mind her head!
{Y:i}He chopped offher head,
he didn't chop offher head.
What I'm sayin' is, this is
a whole new ball game here.
I want to do this.
- Why?
- The bonus.
Is that all?
Yes. I need
the extra money.
{Y:i}Gabriela, don't get
too wrapped up in this.
{Y:i}In this business,
you've got to draw a line...
and I'm afraid you're
about to cross over it.
I want to do this house because
I want to see the worst.
Then I'll know
I can do anything.
- That's all.
- All right.
{Y:i}But... don't do a shoddyjob.
Otherwise, people will hear
about it and stop calling.
Don't worry.
We'll do it right.
Don't worry.
We'll do it right.
- [ Gasps ]
- [ Sighs ]
Hmm.
Just a minute.
{Y:i}[ Door Rattling ]
I don't--
I don't believe this.
{Y:i}Why can't they have ordinary
locks like everybody else?
Let me try.
{Y:i}[ Door Rattling ]
[ Lock Beeps ]
It's easy!
[ Gasps ]
Oh, no!
Jesus Christ,
this place is a mess!
Shit!
{Y:i}Just--just move over.
I gotta use the spray, all right?
Okay.
{Y:i}[ Elena Coughing ]
[ Coughing Continues ]
{Y:i}[ Clattering ]
[ Panting ]
Look what he did.
I can see.
All right...
let's get the windows.
You get those:
I'll get the ones in the back.
{Y:i}[ Window Opening ]
{Y:i}[ Paul Breathing ]
{Y:i}[ Footsteps ]
Okay...
let's get started.
Look, some blood
went into that room!
Don't worry about that now.
We'll do the kitchen tomorrow.
See, the longer you wait
with hardwood floors, the worse it gets.
{Y:i}So we gotta do them
first, all right?
Let's go. Come on.
Okay.
{Y:i}[ Elena ]
Yeah, sure.
{Y:i}All right?
One, two, three.
{Y:i}Go. Back, back, back.
Watch that table!
Watch the table. Okay.
All right. Down.
All right, come over here.
Grab this other rug.
With me, roll it to the end.
All right?
Ready? Go. With me.
Gabriela, with me--
There you go. All right.
Ah, Geez, look at these
fucking stains, man!
This is gonna
take forever.
[ Grunting ]
Yeah.
- [ Straining ]
- [ Bolt Breaks Loose ]
- Look at this place.
- [ Panting ]
They're gonna have to get rid
of all these curtains.
There's no way in hell I'm gonna
get the smell out of'em. No way.
Want a snack? What?
Did you hear that?
- What, Gabriela?
- Shhh. Listen.
{Y:i}[ Thud, Humming ]
[ Snickers ]
Sorry.
- Do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.
{Y:i}All right, now listen. This... is oak.
[ Knocks On Floor ]
Gotta scrub very hard
to get it up.
Okay?
I can stay late
if we have to.
Well, we're not staying late.
I have to pick up my son.
Scrub.
My grandmother had one of these
at her house in the mountains.
That's where she
told stories at night.
My grandmother, she knew
all her stories by heart.
My sister and me
loved them so much.
Our favorite story
was "Hansel And Gretel."
I guess all little kids
like that story.
I bet your son knows it.
Yeah.
My favorite part
is the end.
Just when you think the witch
is going to bake Hansel and eat him...
Gretel tricks the witch,
pushes her into the oven and burns her.
That's not what happens.
{Y:i}Yes. Gretel asks the witch
to look into the oven...
and then she pushes her in.
What?
She doesn't burn her.
Yes, that's how it happens.
Forget it.
What?
What?
Look, Gabriela, you're gonna have to
start taking this job more seriously.
You know what I'm saying?
- I do take it seriously.
- No, you don't.
I'm not gonna be able
to work with you anymore...
if you don't stop playing around
and talking so much.
You are gonna have to start
concentrating on the job.
- I do.
- No, you don't.
You see, concentrating
doesn't mean yipping...
about how he killed her,
why he killed her, where he killed her.
It's always better
if you talk about it.
Yeah, well, you know what?
I don't wanna hear another word
about what the guy did to her.
{Y:i}Okay? This is not
"Hansel And Gretel"or some shit.
This is real.
{Y:i}[ Paul Breathing ]
I know that.
{Y:i}[ Clattering ]
{Y:i}[ Scrubbing ]
Okay... it's 5:00.
Let's go.
- We'll leave all this stuff
here until tomorrow.
- Okay.
Let's go, now.
{Y:i}Sorry-ass mouse
is shot to hell.
{Y:i}- [ Elena ] Roger.
- Yeah?
We gotta talk.
- Good night, Gabriela.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye,Joan.
Come on, Eva.
Hurry up.
Come on. Forget it.
I'm not waiting.
Wait. I wanna
go shopping.
- How was it?
- You should see it.
- How is Elena?
- I don't think she liked it.
- [ Scoffs ]
- I don't think she likes me.
I can't believe
you asked for that job.
- I thought she was doing fine.
- Well, she's not.
What's the matter?
Is she doing something weird?
She's just not taking
the job seriously.
She talks about what
happened the whole time.
Well, I don't care what she talks about
as long as she's doing the job, right?
Well, look...
I can't concentrate, okay?
Did you ever find
anything at a job?
You know, something not even
the police could find?
- Something about a crime?
- Yes.
Oh, one time--
this is gross--
I found a finger behind
a barrel in this house.
- A finger?
- Yeah. I don't know how it got there.
I just told Roger about it,
and he told the police and
I never heard anything more.
That's the only time
I ever found anything. Why?
Curious.
Okay. Well, you
have a good time.
I will. Bye.
Good night.
Look, Elena,just focus on the work
like you always do.
I-I'm sorry. I just can't
do my job when she's around.
[ Sighs ]
{Y:i}Look, I gotta go.
Bye.
- Elena?
- Yeah?
Gabriela's just tryin'
to work her way through this...
the best way she can,
like we all are.
{Y:i}[ Grunting ]
[ Grunting Continues ]
Yeah.
Are you okay?
It seems like you're
someplace else.
- No, I'm here.
- Are you sure?
- It's something at work.
- What?
You know that
Blue Blood guy?
- They're making you do that?
- That's what we did today.
It's a little scary,
but it's exciting.
[ Laughing ]
Go, Gabriela.
Uh... what
did it look like?
There was so much blood
we couldn't finish today.
[ Laughs ]
{Y:i}[ Indistinct Singing
In Spanish ]
Strange thing about it is
he didn't chop off her head.
- What?
- He always does.
Well, how do you know
he didn't this time?
You can tell from--
from the outline.
The other thing is...
there's a name by the body.
What do you mean?
Somebody wrote a name
next to the body.
- Did you tell anybody?
- No, no, no. I can't tell Elena.
I mean, she's a nice person,
but she just wants to clean and go home.
I'm going to tell
Mr. Roger tomorrow.
Oh. Um...
where's the name?
Look, Eduardo.
- What's that?
- This is her arm.
And right there is the head.
Mmm. Is that her leg?
Looks like her leg.
No, that's not her leg.
I'm trying to show you the name.
Look.
Wait.
I have a better idea.
You're going to love this.
[ Grunting ]
[ Whimpers ]
Oh, no!
Jesus Christ!
[ Grunting Continues ]
[ Eduardo ]
What if someone sees us?
[ Gabriela ] It's okay.
There's no one here.
- What are you doing?
- I left it open.
- Gabriela, I don't know--
- Eduardo, please.
- I don't think we should do this.
- Come on.
{Y:i}- Let's go back to El Cid.
- Later, maybe.
{Y:i}- No, come on. The new band's
probably still playing.
- Eduardo, I want you to see.
Ready?
Oh, my God!
- This is horrible.
- It was horrible.
- It's so--
- I know.
- How can you do this?
- I thought you were interested.
God.
I like to read about it,
but... this is different.
Look, you can see
where he was...
and where she was
and how he did it.
I don't want to see this.
You've never
wondered about this?
What?
It's all right there.
- Gabriela, let's go.
- Wait.
{Y:i}- Gabriela--
- Wait, Eduardo.
The first time was here.
{Y:i}Then he chased her
all along this way.
Here something went wrong.
Gabriela, let's go!
Look, Eduardo,
there's blood under here.
- Gabriela, come on.
No, we can't do this.
- Eduardo! Eduardo, wait!
{Y:i}- Let's go.
- Eduardo, it's my job!
- No, come on.
- Wait, I want to show you the name.
I'm going. If you
wanna come, let's go.
I know you're afraid.
It scares me too.
But it's not as bad
as you think.
It's always worse in your mind.
Come, look--
You're not coming with me?
{Y:i}[ Door Opens ]
{Y:i}[ Continues ]
{Y:i}[ Tempo Increases ]
{Y:i}[ Stops ]
{Y:i}[ Stops ]
What do you think
you were doing?
I am the maid.
[ Rubs Brush ]
I want to know
what you were doing.
Dancing.
Weren't you hired
to come here and clean?
Yes.
Well, then...
that's just about
the sickest thing I've ever seen.
{Y:i}You know,you should show
a little bit more respect next time.
Is this your house?
I want you
to clean this up.
There.
{Y:i}Right there.
{Y:i}I want you to finish
cleaning it up.
{Y:i}[ Removes Cap ]
{Y:i}[ Spraying ]
{Y:i}[ Scrubbing ]
You?
Get it off.
{Y:i}[ Spraying ]
Okay.
I won't tell anybody.
{Y:i}[ Shuddering ]
{Y:i}[ Picks Up Cassette ]
So you like to dance?
Do you feel
like dancing now?
No.
Come on.
You can teach me.
- [ Shuddering ]
- Come on.
- What is your name?
- Gabriela.
Beautiful. I like it.
So... where do I
put my hands?
[ Shuddering ]
Show me. It's okay.
{Y:i}[ Singing In Spanish ]
And the steps?
Like this.
{Y:i}[ Singing Continues ]
Side. Okay.
Side.
Where are you from?
Cuba?
Colombia.
- That's a dangerous place
for a little girl.
- Not really.
- No?
- No.
You're very good, but
I have to tell you something.
I lied.
I do this at Club Babalu
all the time.
[ Panting ]
Just not with a knife.
[ Panting ]
You don't use a knife.
Oh, yes, I do.
For the head, I mean.
A sword.
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Panting ]
What's your perfume?
- La Jour.
- La Jour?
- Mm-hmm.
- I like it.
It's enticing.
[ Gasps, Shuddering ]
Why do you use the knife
if you have the sword?
[ Gasps ]
It's clumsy.
You're a very good partner.
[ Panting ]
- When did you dance with her?
- Never like this.
If you're going to chop off her
head, why do you do all this?
{Y:i}What is this?
I thought we were dancing.
Did you hold her down?
What do you think?
I don't know.
[ Laughs ]
{Y:i}[ Stops ]
Why don't you show me
what you know?
{Y:i}- Hmm?
- [ New Song Starts ]
Show me.
[ Gasping ]
You were here.
Go ahead.
The first time was here.
Right after
I gave her a kiss.
Good. Then what?
Then she ran away.
{Y:i}No... I let her go.
Why?
Go on.
Maybe you... pushed her
against this wall?
She fell.
She was on her knees.
She wanted to hit you.
You let her try.
She did hit me.
And then you stopped her
and you stabbed her.
Where?
Everywhere.
You were angry.
- Yes.
- Because she hit you.
[ Panting Continues ]
Then you let her
run into here.
Then what?
Then you stabbed her more.
There was blood
all along here.
Then you stabbed her
again here.
I stabbed her many times.
We already know that, right?
- Uh-huh.
- It's a given.
Then she fell here,
and you let her crawl into here.
Show me.
Please.
{Y:i}[ New Song Starts ]
{Y:i}[ Singing In Spanish ]
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Grunting, Whimpering ]
She was against this...
for a long time.
You're not telling me
what was really going on.
You got close...
so you could see her eyes.
- Yes.
- Did she say something?
- Yes.
- What?
Oh... they all
say the same thing.
The loved ones this,
the loved ones that.
- She said that?
- Verbatim?
{Y:i}- Uh-huh.
- She said...
"No one deserves
to die like this."
You like to hear them?
That makes you feel good.
Yes, Gabriela. Yes.
{Y:i}[ Singing Continues ]
You always let her get away.
You let her crawl into here.
¤¤¤[ New Song Starts ]
You let them think
you're gone.
But I'm watching them crawl.
They think they can live.
It's better to... give them
a little hope, don't you think?
Then you go for the head.
{Y:i}[ Knife Hits Floor ]
They know they're
going to die...
and that's
what you want.
When you cut the head, you
want to watch their face.
You want them to watch you.
It makes you feel alive.
It's so pure.
I take them and...
hold their heads in my hands.
And I feel that-- that--
And then they go...
and it's over.
Of course, here
she ruined everything.
Do they talk?
- What?
- The heads.
- What do you mean?
- When you cut them.
No.
It's the face.
It's in their eyes.
Yes, but after that,
sometimes the head says some words.
The head... doesn't.
No. No.
They're supposed to talk.
They don't, o--
They don't.
I know, okay?
They don't.
I think they talk.
They could tell you
something.
[ Inhales ]
We were so close.
What?
We were so close, Gabriela.
No. No!
Don't do this.
{Y:i}[ Whimpering ]
What did I say?

- [ Grunts ]
- [ Screaming ]

No. Oh, no.
- No, please, let me go.
