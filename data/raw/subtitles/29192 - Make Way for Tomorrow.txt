Well! [Chuckles]
Gee, it's good to see you!
Hey, you'll catch your death
of cold. Go on, get in there.
- Gosh, you're looking well, ma.
- Oh, so are you, george.
Well, i got a little cold, but i'm all right.
I think you look better than
you did five or six months ago.
You looked a little peaked then, i thought.
- I see the others got here before me.
- Yes. Your pa's waitin' for you though.
What do you mean, ma? Say, what
is this gathering of the clan?
Well, i'd rather pa told you.
How's anita and the baby?
Oh, they're just fine.
Only rhoda isn't a baby anymore.
She's thinking of going to college.
Oh! Oh, pa, here's george.
Well, there's a familiar
sight. Pa in the same old chair.
- Hello, george.
- Don't get up. Don't get up.
Gee, it's good to see you, pa.
Gosh, i haven't seen you since -
well, it's been too long, anyway.
I don't know. We plan, we plan -
- hello, nellie.
- Hello, george.
As for you, you know, i don't
know when i saw you last.
Oh, i forgot. I can't kiss ya, cora.
I got a nasty little cold.
I shouldn't have kissed you either.
[Man] "m"/s for the
m/ll/on th/ngs she gave me
"o"means only that she's grow/ng old
# oh, yes, and "t" is for the
tears she shed to save me #
# "h" is for her heart of purest gold #
hello, folks.
# "E" is for her eyes
with love light shining #
# "r" means right and
right she'll always be #

# put them all together #
#they spell "mother" #
#a word that means the world to #
## [vocalizing]
- [Panting] mother.
- [Chuckles] robert.
- Here you are, mother.
- Oh, no, dear.
That don't go with standing over a hot stove.
Okay, it'll just be two for
me. How about you, george?
You're still the best-looking
one in the family, robert.
Yeah? The day i was born, pop took one look
at me and said, "that did it. No more coopers!"
[Laughs]
Cora?
Here ya are, nellie.
- [Gasps]
- Oh! I got somethin' on you, nellie.
Here ya are, pa.
- Thanks.
- Try that on your ulcer.
Wait a minute, now. Nobody drink. I always
make it a point to drink to somethin'.
Let's see. Now, let me think.
Don't think too hard, robert.
You might hurt yourself.
Why, pa! [Laughs]
Let's see now, uh -
here's to our house...
through sunsh/ne or showers...
be it ever so humble...
by golly, it's ours.
- [Chuckling] good, huh, pop?
- [Cora] yeah.
Ah, it's all right. Only the
last line don't make sense.
- Does it, ma?
- No.
- You see, the house - -
don't tell 'em now, bark.
- Wait till after dinner.
- What is it?
Why not now? That's why we got 'em down here.
You see, the house isn't "ours" anymore.
The bank is taking it over.
- The bank?
- You mean you've lost it?
Oh, that's awful!
Bank? Well, there's a bank for ya.
What happened, father?
Well, as you know i haven't
been working for, uh-
well, it's almost four years now.
That's right, ain't it, ma? Four years?
Four years 5th ofjune, pa.
And with everything going
out and nothing coming in...
i couldn't keep up the payments.
So long as i never sent them anything...
they sent for me.
The head of the bank, randy dunlap...
asked me to drop in to his
house for a little chat.
- You remember h/m? Randy dunlap?
- Yes.
He used to keep company with
your mother before i cut him out.
Bark!
So i dropped in and he asked me to sit down.
[Chuckling]
George, do you know what he was wearing?
- A kimono.
- No!
- Yeah!
- Oh, now, bark.
It must have been a dressing gown.
I know a dressing gown when i see it.
It was a kimono, george.
Well, he asked me to sit down.
Then he offered me a cigar.
Do dressing gowns have... flowers on 'em?
Oh, bark!
Well, uh, never mind that,
father. What did he say?
Oh, he was nice enough.
He put his arm around me and he said...
"bark, i hate to have to do this to you."
But deep down in his heart i
think he was saying, "goody."
Oh, now, bark.
He did say that we could take
our time about moving out.
- Yeah, he d/d.
- How much time did he give you, father?
Six months.
Oh!
Oh, well, then there's no immediate rush.
When are the six months up?
Tuesday.
But
- but why didn't you tell us sooner?
Well, your father and i were hoping
that something would turn up...
and we wouldn't have to tell you at all.
Tuesday. Doesn't give us much time, does it?
Well, this house has been too big...
for your mother to take care of anyway.
Yeah, father, but what i mean is...
if we'd known sooner we could have all
chipped in and found you a place somewhere.
Or
- [chuckles]
I know nellie will tell you
harvey's business never was worse.
That's right. You'd be surprised
if you knew how bad things are.
Oh, sure. Who gave you that
dress, the salvation army?
[Robert, cora chuckling]
And cora will tell you that if bill doesn't get
a job soon, she'll have to go to work herself.
And, uh -yeah.
Well, i can't do it alone.
And there's no po/nt /n wr/t/ng to
add/e way out there /n cal/forn/a.
No, she's never even sent us an orange.
And inasmuch as anita and i are
planning to send rhoda to college -
now, the only th/ng i can suggest /s
that you come to l/ve w/th one of us...
until we get ourselves straightened out.
Your father and i were
talking about that, and we -
i know what you're thinking about, mother, but
you're more than welcome with any one of us.
Now, nellie, after all,
there's only you and harvey.
Yes, but what about harvey?
- Oh, we wouldn't want to ask harvey.
- Oh, no, we wouldn't ask harvey.
No, we asked harvey to marry nellie. We
can't expect the guy to do more than that.
Father, will you make him
stop talking like that!
Robert, stop talking that way.
Cut it out, robert.
I haven't room for both of you. There's
only a small couch in the living room.
Mother, there's an extra bed in rhoda's
room, and she'd love to have you.
If father doesn't mind going to cora's for
a while, why don't you come on a visit to us?
Well, that's awfully nice of you, george...
but your father and i thought
that no matter what happened...
we'd always be t -
oh, well, never mind what we thought.
Nellie, can't you and harvey-
yes, i can. I plan to do
more than you and cora.
I can practically promise that within
three months they'll be together again.
Of course i'll have to
speak to harvey about it.
Will you put that in
writing, nellie? [Chuckling]
Well, that's more like it.
Well, i
- i guess everything's settled.
Mother comes for a visit to us...
and father goes to cora's for a while.
- Hmm?
- Well, bark?
Maybe it'll work out all right.
Sure.
It'll be very nice living
with the children for a while.
[George] Of course!
- Yeah, except
- - except what?
Except it never has worked
out for anybody else.
- Oh, father, there's nothing to worry about.
- Now, bark, you ought not to say that.
Well?
[Chuckling]
And what are you up to?
I just had a feeling that grandpa's
picture really belonged in here.
Oh, you did?
Yesterday it was this old, ancient
antique, and today it's "grandpa's picture."
Oh, i've got grandma in
my room, and that's enough.
I know how you love your own room, honey.
It's tough on all of us.
Even grandma, you know.
[Rocker creaking]
But it'll only be for three months,
and then aunt nellie will take her.
Well, okay.
I'll have mamie take these
things back to my room.
Oh, bridge class tonight?
Mob of them.
By the way, i haven't seen
any of your friends lately.
- What's the matter?
- Grandma.
- She talks an arm off everyone i bring around.
- I know.
I've had a taste of it.
But you must bring your friends home.
I won't have you going out
with boys i've never met.
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello, george.
- Hello, daddy!
- Dear.
Oh, you're gonna put pa's picture in here!
That's fine. Mmm.
Darling.
[Kisses]
Oh, say, what about mother tonight,
with this bridge and everything?
She's go/ng to be /n the way, /sn't she?
Wait.
[Whispers] Is she asleep?
Hope i don't get harvey.
Oh, hello, harvey.
Hiya, boy.
Put nellie on, will you, harvey?
Nellie.
It's george.
Hello, george.
Oh, hello, nellie. I -
nellie, anita's having
her bridge class tonight...
and... i know mother's going
to be bored to distraction.
I thought -
oh, i
- i'm so sorry, but harvey's bought some theater tickets for tonight.
Well, you know how it is.
We have to entertain the
people he does business with...
and i guess that's what it is tonight.
Oh, no, george, i couldn't
possibly take mother tonight.
- Tell him you can't take her anytime.
- Shh!
What's the use of stalling? I'm
not going to have your parents here.
- Well, george, i would if i could.
- But you can't.
- Will you shut up.
- You'll have to tell him sooner or later.
- What, george? Just a minute, george.
- I married you. I didn't marry your folks.
I didn't ask my mother to live here, did i?
[Voice cracks] Did i?
What, george?
Oh, george, i am willing to do my part.
- No roof is big enough for two families.
- No, i couldn't possibly take mother tonight.
I'm sorry. Good-bye.
Satisfied?
Incidentally, who are we
going out with tonight?
My mother. But that's different. I -
hmm. I was so afraid it
was someone i didn't like.
Mother just won't fit in at all, will she?
You don't suppose she'd
stay in her room, do you?
No.
I don't see how we could -
[george] Oh, hello, mother.
It's mother.
George, i never heard such
nonsense in all my life...
trying to get nellie to take me
and talk of me staying in my room.
It's only because we thought you'd be bored.
Well, don't you worry about me.
Folks'd think it was pretty
funny if i wasn't around.
They'd think you were ashamed of me.
George was only trying
to be kind to you, dear.
My bridge pupils drive him mad.
[Mother] i guess you won't ever
have to expla/n george to h/s mother.
Oh, pa's picture. You gonna put it in here?
Aw, that's fine.
Another day has gone by and no word from him.
- Do you suppose he's all right?
- Of course he's all right.
We'd hear fast enough if he were ill.
Well, i guess that's true.
Is, uh, my tuxedo laid out?
Yes. I couldn't find your shirt.
- Did you send it to the laundry?
- No.
- I did. - Oh,
but, mother-
i took it to the laundry around the corner.
They've got a s/gn /n the w/ndow
- "br/ng your own bundle and save 20%.' '
Yes, but we -
besides, george, your shirts haven't
looked as crisp and fresh as they should.
These people do lovely work.
Yes, except that i won't
have a shirt for tonight.
Well, i didn't know that -
now look here, mother c...
i know you like to look after george.
Yes.
- Well, so do i.
- Of course.
And though i don't do much talking
about it, i like to run my house too.
Oh, well, i only wanted to help.
- Of course. - And you're
so busy playing bridge -
i don't play bridge, i teach bridge.
There's a difference that you'd notice...
if you had to meet the
bills of this apartment.
- Wh - - well, it's
all very simple.
I'll just run out and buy another shirt.
[Chuckles]
Well, i guess i'm not much help around here.
Oh, mother c!
[Sighs]
I could make the sandwiches, couldn't i?
They're coming from the delicatessen.
- It's cheaper to make 'em at home.
- I know.
But we couldn't do so well.
These are going to be fancy.
How fancy can a sandwich be?
You'll see.
Any bid made subsequently
to an opponent's bid...
is known as an overcall or a defensing bid.
An overcall may be made
with a much weaker hand...
than an or/g/nal b/d...
a fact wh/ch the partner must bear /n m/nd.
As a rule, it is inadvisable...
to make an overcall on
two of a four-card suit -
or to overcall with a no-trump bid...
without a double-stopper...
in the suit bid by the opponent.
It requires more strength -
i know you'll forgive me if i
interrupt myself for a moment...
but i do so want you all
to meet my husband's mother.
[Guests, simultaneously] How do you do?
Well, um, anyway, um...
suppose we, um, play the hands?
Uh, suppose we play them.
- I'll bid one spade.
- One spade.
- One spade.
- Two hearts.
[Guests chattering]
[Rocker creaking]
[Creaking continues]
[Creak/ng cont/nues]
[Creaking stops]
[Creaks]
She didn't show up, so i'm
playing this. Three spades.
[Woman] Do you play cards?
Well, it's, uh
- it's funny...
but, you know...
with a teacher right here in the family...
i don't believe i could
ever learn to play bridge.
[Guests chuckling]
Well, maybe a little hearts.
I used to play a lot with my husband.
I always gave him the queen of
spades. We called her dirty dora.
[Guests laughing]
Say, by the way, that's a good heart hand.
And you haven't got dora. Let's see who has.
Oh! You! [Giggling]
Honey, you're going to the
movies alone tonight, aren't you?
- Well, aren't
you? - Uh-huh.
If you love me, if i've
ever done anything for you...
that you appreciated even a little bit...
for heaven's sake, take
your grandmother with you.
Oh, that's no fair. And anyway,
she likes the company here.
Well, maybe i can fix that.
[Door opens, closes]
Mother c, rhoda's set on
going to the pictures tonight.
Do you think it's all
right if she goes alone?
- Oh, i should say not.
- That's what i thought.
Would you go with her? Or would
that be too much of a responsibility?
Why, anything i can do to
help you, dear, i'll be glad.
What a load off my mind. Will you tell rhoda?
- Why, certainly.
- Thank you, dear.
[Mov/e: Orchestra, upbeat]
[No audible dialogue]
[No audible dialogue]
[Mov/e: Orchestra, dramat/c]
Can you give me a rough idea
of what the picture's about?
Yeah.
It's the old gag about the guy that
takes the blame for a job his pal done.
The pal's a rat and lets
the nice guy go to the pen.
But when he's dyin', the rat confesses
and the boy and girl wind up -
- well, is it sad in any place?
- Some of'em cry when his dog dies.
- Thanks!
- There's a newsreel and betty boop.
Oh. [chuckles] There you are.
- It was a good show, wasn't it?
- Yes.
I liked the boy very much.
- Didn't you?
- Why, i don't know.
I only caught a swift glimpse
of him as you got out of his car.
As i got -
oh. You saw me.
Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna tell?
Are you gonna do it again?
Uh-uh. Are you gonna tell?
No.
[Chattering]
- Oh, here's your mother.
- Oh! Hello, mother.
- Hello.
- Like the picture?
- Oh, it was
fine. - Uh-huh.
A little sad in places,
but it had a happy ending.
Uh, a young man was taking
the blame for his friend...
who wasn't a very strong character.
But the girl believed in the young man
- the nice young man, i mean.
And you know, no matter how black things looked
- [chuckles]
I guess i shouldn't be telling you this,
'cause it might spoil the picture for ya.
[Guests chuckling]
Oh, i guess i should go to
bed. It must be after 11:00.
- What time do you got?
- Why, i have only 10:30.
Oh. Well, then i can stay a little while.
[Rhone r/ngs]
[An/ta] Excuse me, please.
[R/ng/ng cont/nues]
Hello.
Oh, hello, father c. Just a minute.
I forgot. He called while you were out.
[Loudly] Hello? Is that you, bark?
This is lucy, bark!
How are ya? I say, how are ya?
Well, i was worried about
you. Why didn't you write?
You oughta write. You know i worry.
Oh, i'm fine.
I got some friends in tonight playing cards.
Oh, some lovely people, bark.
How's cora?
How are the children?
Really? Well, how's bill?
Well, how are you, bark?
You know what i mean.
How is everything?
Oh, of course, of course.
But three months isn't so long, bark.
Bark, it's getting cool now.
Don't go out without your coat.
And if it rains, don't go out at all.
Oh i'm
- i'm happy as a lark.
Course, i
- i miss you, bark.
That's the only trouble.
I know you do.
Uh, don't forget what i told ya.
We'll soon be together for always.
A
- and you won't worry, w/ll ya?
And please take care of yourself.
Uh, /t's been good to hear your vo/ce, bark.
Must have cost you a lot to call me.
Well, that's -
that's a lot.
You could have bought yourself a
- a good, warm scarf for that.
All r/ght, bark.
Good-bye, bark.
Good-bye...
my dear.
I guess i'll go to bed,
if you'll all excuse me.
I'm tired.
Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
- Good night, mother.
Sorry. Very sorry, mrs. Carr.
Ah, how are you today, mr. Cooper?
I'll be with you in a minute.
And then when you order the
paper by the week, mrs. Carr...
i save it for you no matter how
many people are asking for it...
and that way there are no disappointments.
All right. Shall i pay weekly or monthly?
[Chuckles] well, if you are honest by the week,
i guess you can be honest by the month too.
- So we'll make it by the week.
- All right.
- [Door bell j/ngles]
- [Door opens, closes]
Saved the paper for you,
all right, mr. Cooper.
Yeah? Well, i can't read
it. I broke my glasses again.
Oh! [chuckles] What did cora say this time?
You should have heard her.
Or maybe you did. She hollered loud enough.
[Chuckles] and you say it is nice
to live with your children, huh?
Well, yes, /t /s, mr. Rubens, /n a way.
I hope i didn't give you the
wrong impression about cora.
She's a fine girl.
I guess i'm pretty bothersome to have around.
- Ah.
- [Door bell j/ngl/ng]
Well, what do you want?
I want a stick of gum.
[Rubens] Take /t from the counter.
All in all, my children are pretty fine...
and i'm proud of'em.
I'm proud of mine too.
They leave me alone.
They don't need me, and i don't need them.
I got enough to live from my store...
and i got my sarah and i make
a little music with my violin.
That's all i want from l/fe, and i got /t.
Well, my life is just the same as yours...
except i... don't have a store...
my wife is 300 miles away...
and i
- i can't play the violin.
[Laughing]
Hey, hey, hey.
- [Giggling]
- [Mock giggling]
Go on, go on.
- [Door bell j/ngl/ng]
- You know, i sometimes think that children...
should never grow past the age...
when you have to tuck
'em into bed every night.
That's right.
When they get older and you can't
give them as much as other children...
they're ashamed of you.
And when you give them everything...
and put them through college...
they're ashamed of you.
Yeah.
I guess the world is filled with
what you call schmi - schmills -
schlemiels! [Laughing]
And somebody has to raise 'em.
Mm-hmm.
What do you want?
Have you s/ncere confess/ons for november?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Are you gonna be nice to
your mother when you grow up?
- Jimmy, why don't you answer the man?
- What do i say?
- Oh!
- [Chuckling]
You say yes, of course!
- [Door opens, closes]
- [Door bell j/ngl/ng]
I'll m/ss our talks when
you go away, mr. Cooper...
but i'll be glad for you.
- You'll be with your wife again.
- Thanks.
And i'll be with her soon.
Maybe you could be sooner with
her, and right in this town.
Huh?
There's a lawyer, mr. Hunter, from new york.
He just bought the harrison farm...
and he'll need caretakers -
a man and h/s w/fe.
Caretakers?
I hear about things, you know.
Oh, i wouldn't want to
ask my w/fe to do that.
Anyway, my ch/ldren would have a fit.
So let them have a fit.
You and your wife would be together and
you would earn your own living again.
It's nice of you to suggest it,
but you understand, don't you?
What difference does it make?
Maybe it would be a home
for the rest of your life.
But, say, everybody's got to
do what they think is best.
Mr. Rubens, i, uh
- i wonder if you'd do me a favor.
Sure. Why not?
Uh, it's from my wife.
Uh, would you read it
to me, on account of my-
[chuckling] Is that a favor, mr. Cooper?
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.
"Thursday night.
"Dear bark, i've been
thinking of you all day...
"and have wanted to talk to
you worse than ever before.
[Bark chuckles]
"They say that you don't miss
people so much after a while...
"but i th/nk i m/ss you more than i
d/d at the beg/nn/ng of our separat/on.
"Do you real/ze that when you get th/s
letter /t w/ll be george's 46th b/rthday?
"It seems l/ke yesterday he was born.
"We were so happy then that
/t hurts to remember /t.
"I hate to give in and sound so weak...
"but you understand me and
won't think less of me...
and this is just between us two."
Yeah.
"Harvey and nellie know a woman who
is in the home for the aged women here.
"They thought it would be
nice for me to know her...
"so that i would have someone
my own age to talk to...
"so nellie took me there to meet her.
"Oh, bark, that home for the
aged /s so dreary and d/smal...
"/t was all i could do not to
ask mrs. T/mmons how she stood /t.
"Nellie kept saying how lovely the place was.
"I thought she said it to
cheer mrs. Timmons up...
"but she kept saying it after we left...
so i guess she really thought it was nice."
I guess those places must be terrible.
Go ahead.
[Sighs]
"Poor nellie. She hasn't
been herself at all lately.
"Her doctor wants her to
have a complete change.
"Nellie said europe.
She's very worried, not
about herself, but" -
[clears throat]
"But because that would mean she
couldn't take us like she promised.
"But i told nell/e her health comes first.
"Oh, bark dear...
"/f only someth/ng would turn up...
"so that we could be together.
I love you so that"-
maybe you'd better wait until
you have your glasses fixed.
- [Door opens, closes]
- [Door bell j/ngles]
[Sniffs]
Mama.
Sarah!
So, what do you want?
I just wanted to look at you, mama.
To look at me?
With all the work to be done,
you just wanted to look at me?
Yes, mama.
I wanted to make sure you were here.
I
- i broke my glasses this morning.
Would you mind telling me if
there's any bookkeepers wanted there?
No. Why? Were you a bookkeeper?
I am a bookkeeper.
Well, you see...
before she come here...
when you all went out at night
i always had the nights off.
But, uh, well, uh...
all i mean is...
if this keeps up i may have
to seek other employment.
Mamie, mrs. Cooper doesn't stay up very late.
Wait until she gets to sleep, and
then you can have the night off.
All right?
All right with me.
But she ain't sleepy.
[Mother] Oh, you're all ready to go.
My, you both look awful nice.
- Thank you, mother c. You'll be all right?
- Of course.
- Well, good night, mother.
- Good night.
Sure you'll be all right?
Rhoda's going out too.
This isn't the first time you've left
me alone. Go ahead. Don't worry about me.
But you'll be busy with your rug, won't you?
Well, no.
My head started to ache a little
while ago, and i think i'll stop.
I'll find something to do.
There's always the ra -
oh, no, it isn't working, is it?
Well, i'd forgotten. No matter.
You go ahead and enjoy yourselves.
Don't you even think about me.
Well, good night, mother.
Good night, dear.
There's bicarbonate in
the house, isn't there?
I feel just a mite as though...
i'd have a little dyspepsia tonight.
I know how you feel.
Yes, dear, there's bicarbonate
in the medicine chest.
Well, just so i know, /n case /t gets bad.
Well, maybe we'd better stay.
Oh, no!
You go right ahead and enjoy yourselves.
We will.
- Good night, dear.
- Good n/ght.
Maybe if you take a little walk, huh?
Can't, on account of my arches.
- Good night, mother.
- Good night.
Mamie!
- Yes, ma'am?
- You can have the night off.
Oh, thank you very much.
Good night.
## [Rhoda humming]
Oh. [chuckles] Hi.
I hope the boy you're going out with
tonight will get you home earlier, rhoda.
He's not a boy. He's 35.
Th
- thirty-what?
Well, that's a dangerous
companion for a young girl.
Oh, you think so, huh?
I guess you haven't been out
with any collegians lately.
But at least among the boys your own age...
you'll find the one you'll fall
in love with and want to marry.
I'm going to look around
a bit before i get married.
But a man doesn't want a girl
that runs around with everybody.
I've seen plenty of swell
fellows walk down the aisles...
with girls that had done
everything but murder.
Why, men get together and talk about girls.
Yeah, and then they all make a dash for
the one that's been mentioned the most.
Next lecture at half past tuesday.
Well, i won't be pickin' on you much longer.
You'll soon have your room
to yourself again, rhoda.
Have you got some kind of a plan, grandma?
Well, i haven't, but your grandpa has.
His letter says that he's, uh...
negotiating a piece of
business with some lawyer...
and if it works out satisfactory...
then everything is gonna be all right.
- Oh.
- What's the matter?
Why kid yourself, grandma?
You know he can't get a
job. He's much too old.
Well, i still have faith
in your grandpa's ability.
That's just fooling yourself.
Why don't you face facts, grandma?
Oh, rhoda.
When you're 17 and the world's beautiful...
facing facts is...
just as slick fun as
dancing or going to parties.
But when you're 70...
well, you don't care about dancing...
and you don't think about parties anymore.
And about the only fun you have left is...
pretending that there
ain't any facts to face.
So would you mind if i just kind of...
went on pretending?
Grandma?
I didn't mean to -
oh, i
- i know, honey.
Why don't you try to relax?
You'll wear yourself to a frazzle.
But she could telephone or something.
Don't you see? Something
terrible must have happened.
I know rhoda so well. I know she
wouldn't do a thing like this willingly.
She must have met with an accident.
I'll finish dressing in case
george wants me for anything.
[Door opens, closes]
[Phone ringing]
Hello. Yes?
This is mrs. Cooper.
What
- don't talk so fast.
You don't want me.
- Uh - hello? -
[Cl/cks rece/ver cradle]
- It was for you.
- Well, why didn't you let me talk?
She hung up. She called about rhoda.
- What did she say?
How is she? - Oh, uh -
i'll tell you.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my, oh, my.
[Door closes]
You don't know how awful
i feel about this, anita.
Let's not talk about it, if you don't
mind, at least not until we know more.
Well, i just got to talk about it!
I feel a little guilty. I feel
that i'm to blame a little bit.
You see, i could have told you,
and maybe i should have told you.
Told me what?
Well, that rhoda /sn't
always just absolutely honest.
One n/ght when she and i went
to the mov/es she met a boy.
- You didn't know.
- Why didn't you tell me then?
- Well, i promised rhoda
- - you promised rhoda?
What right had you to
assume that responsibility?
- Well, rhoda promised that she'd never-
- what rhoda promised is beside the point.
What right have you to keep
rhoda's actions a secret from me?
- She's my child, not yours. -
Well, you were so busy with your-
oh, i'm so busy with my bridge and things.
I thought we'd get to that sooner or later.
So this is all my fault because
i try to make a few extra dollars.
If it's anybody's fault, i know who to blame.
Why do you suppose rhoda stopped
inviting her friends here to the house?
Why do you suppose she started meeting them
on the outside? Well, i'm going to tell you!
It's because you like to entertain them! They
were her friends, and you did all the talking!
Why, anita, i didn't know
i was doing anything wrong.
You must have known you were doing something
wrong when you concealed rhoda's actions from me.
You must have known you were doing
something that you had no right to do.
You raised five children of your
own. You might let me raise one.
- But, no, you've got to butt
in. You've got to - - anita!
I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.
You're worr/ed about rhoda...
so there won't be any hard feelings.
[Coughing]
I'll be glad when you go back to work.
[Loud coughing, groans]
I wish your mother was here.
She'd get me on my feet so
quick, it'd make your head swim.
You've only got a little cold.
What's the good of worrying mother?
[Doorbell r/ngs]
- Who on earth's that?
- [R/ngs]
Well, it must be the doctor.
Good heavens! He got here quick enough.
No, but -wait a minute.
- Come on.
- Huh?
- Come on.
- All right.
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning, mr. Payne. Who's ill?
This way, doctor.
Here he is.
Hmm. So this is the patient.
He's shivering.
You would, too, if you'd
run through the house...
in your nightshirt with bare feet.
[Chuckles]
- I, uh - i wouldn't
let him do that. - No.
Your mother knows more about medicine...
than all these young doctors put together.
[Nervous chuckling]
[Chuckles] Well, we'll, uh
- we'll have a look at him.
When a man's sick, he don't want a -
how long have you been practicin'?
Oh, for several, uh -
that is, for some time now.
How'd you come to take it up?
Why, my father's one of the
biggest doctors in this city.
Why didn't you get his father?
- I'm sick- - put that
thermometer back in your mouth!
- [Groans]
- [B/ll] cora!
Excuse me, doctor.
[Clears throat]
[Groans]
I wanted to talk to you when
your old man wasn't around.
You think we ought to send for your mother?
I'm kind of sorry for him.
So am i, but we haven't got room.
Once we got 'em both, we've got 'em.
George would try and talk us into
keeping 'em. Nellie's run out on her.
I burn when i think of her. And
addie's doing nothing to help.
Yeah. What about addie?
Hmm.
What about her?
It's only a little over a hundred.
If it goes any higher,
will you send for his dad?
[Chuckles] Now we'll do a little listening.
- Hmm?
- Sit up, please.
[Grunting, coughs]
- I suppose i'll get pneumonia now.
- That's it.
Ooh! That thing is cold as ice.
- Take a deep breath.
- [Inhales]
[Grunting, coughing]
Say "99."
What for? That can't cure a cold.
I'd rather say "23" to you...
but i guess you're too young
to know that means "skiddoo."
Father, behave yourself and say "99."
Darned if i will. I'd feel foolish.
I'm too old to play games with
the neighbors' youngsters, cora.
- You mustn't mind him, doctor.
- That's quite all right.
Going around as i do, i run
into all kinds of patients.
Come on, mr. Cooper. Say "99."
I will not, and i'll bet you
haven't got many patients.
I've had lots of colds, and i always
got over 'em all right before...
and i never had to say... that number.
All right.
- Now we'll listen to your heart.
- Yeah. I didn't say it.
[Doorbell r/ngs]
Yes? What do you want?
Excuse me. My name is max rubens.
I have the paper store down on graham street.
We have a boy who delivers 'em.
[Doorbell r/ng/ng]
[Chuckling] I wasn't trying to do business.
But it is always a good idea, huh?
- You're cora, no?
- Yes.
Mm-hmm. Your father speaks of you.
It's on account of him i come like this.
- I heard he was sick.
- A slight cold. It's nothin'.
Oh. Could i see him?
The doctor don't want
him to have any visitors.
Visitors would upset him.
It's more likely your father
would upset the visitors.
Certainly they won't hurt him.
All right. If the doctor says so. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Right in there.
What's the matter, doctor?
Oh, it's
- it's nothing to be alarmed about, mrs. Payne.
I
- i was looking at your father's throat, and he bit me.
I'm sorry.
Keep him in bed and put
mustard plasters on his chest.
About his cold -
this winter weather and everything.
Wouldn't it be a good idea
if i sent him to california?
I, uh
- i'd think it'd be a good idea if you could send him almost anywhere.
- [Chuckling]
- I felt sure you'd say that, doctor.
All along i felt that father
couldn't stand these awful winters...
and california'd be better.
It certainly is wonderful soup, mr. Rubens.
- Sure.
- I can feel it warming me all over.
Sure it's wonderful.
My wife made it as soon
as she heard you were sick.
- Hmm?
- Just like me, she wants you to get well.
[Chuckling] Yeah. That's nice of her.
Now, if somebody would only call up my wife.
But your daughter can
take good care of you...
and maybe she don't want
her mother around, kibitzing.
You know how it is.
- Now, i've got to fix your mustard plaster.
- Mmm.
- What are you eating?
- Some soup mrs. Rubens made for me.
- Wasn't that nice?
- That's fine, isn't it?
- Mmm. You bet it is.
- [Laughs]
The neighbors think i don't
feed you properly, i guess.
- Hmm?
- Don't eat any more of it. How do i know what's in it?
There's nothing in that
soup but good chicken.
- Mm-hmm. - When
my sarah makes -
your sarah can mind her own
business. I cook for my father.
You should live until you
can cook like my sarah.
Oh?
Don't put any more of that in your stomach.
- Yeah. I'm afraid it's all gone, cora.
- You mean you ate all this mess?
Mrs. Payne, for myself i don't care. Mm-mmm.
But my sarah, when she makes a soup...
a king can eat it, and she worked -
you can tell your sarah if he's sick
tonight, she can come take care of him.
- Good-bye, mr.
Cooper. - Good-bye.
And thanks for coming...
and thanks for the -
thanks.
[Mouths words]
[Chuckling]
[Coughing]
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
- Will you please stop worrying, mother?
- Oh, i can't.
But cora said his
temperature is normal tonight.
But it may be up again tomorrow.
Anyway, your father doesn't like his doctor.
Look, mother, his
temperature is normal tonight.
But it may be up again tomorrow.
Isn't this where we came in?
[Whispers] Shut up.
Mother, will you please
stop borrowing trouble?
Oh, dear. I guess i'll go see how anita is.
Uh, no, no, no.
I'd better go, mother. Hmm?
[Rocker creaking]
Now, stop it, honey.
- You're just going to make yourself ill.
- I can't seem to help it.
But mrs. Claire promised to keep
rhoda's name out of the case.
Everything is going to be all right.
It's you that i'm worried about.
Gosh, i never saw you give in so completely.
But everything's gone wrong.
I care as much about your mother
as any daughter-in-law can, but -
- what's mother got to do with it?
- Well, didn't she tell you that i -
oh, yes, she said something about an
argument, but never mind that, dear.
But there's no place for your mother
to go, now that nellie's backed out.
And rhoda positively refuses to bring
her friends home while she's here.
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Take this business today.
It never would have happened
if rhoda had been able...
to entertain her friends
at home as she used to.
I used to know all of rhoda's men
friends and what was going on, but now -
i know. Rhoda used to have
the house full of her friends.
She's got to have them again,
george. She's got to. Don't you see?
What happened today is just a
sample. She'll be leaving us next.
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, yes, she will.
She'll get a job and an apartment of her own.
- Of course, those things happen, don't they?
- And we're helpless to stop it.
We can't turn your mother
out into the streets...
and yet she's driving rhoda -
i know.
L- i -
i know.
- Maybe - -
what, dear?
Hmm? Nothing. Nothing.
## [Orchestra on radio: Jazz]
## [Vocalizing]
- Did i awaken you, grandma?
- It doesn't matter.
- Is there any mail?
- I think so.
[Cont/nues]
- Good evening, mother c.
- Hello, ma.
Hi.
[Anita] Rhoda.
## [Radio off]
I spoke to your father today, george.
He told me that he's perfectly well aga/n.
Yes.
We've got to keep him well, mother.
The trouble is, that can't
be done in this climate.
Cora's doctor says that father positively
has to go where there are no hard winters...
and we thought, on account
of add/e l/v/ng /n cal/forn/a-
he's going out there to live?
Just for a l/ttle wh/le,
for h/s health, dear.
Oh, of course.
I want him to be well.
There isn't anything i
- i want as much...
unless it's that you children
should be healthy and happy.
Cora thought that addie would take you both.
Add/e says she can't.
As long as she takes father, that's enough.
Well...
he'll be leaving soon?
I guess so.
Maybe i'll be able to
see him to say good-bye?
Oh. Of course.
Mother.
There's something else i've got to tell you.
Well, there's someth/ng i'd
l/ke to say to you first.
Let me do it while i can. You tell me later.
Well, it's only this.
I don't want to hurt your feelings...
but i haven't been too happy here.
[Sniffles] It's lonesome in this apartment...
with everybody gone all day.
Uh, would you mind terribly...
if i decided to leave you...
to go to the idylwild home?
Well, /t's a fine place.
I'd meet fr/ends my own age, and-
- but, mother, i didn't - -
no, now let me fin/sh, dear.
Once i thought that your father and i...
might get together again...
but, well, i -
i see that it'll never turn out that way.
So i want to go to the home.
[Inhales, sighs]
Well, i'm glad that's over.
I hated to tell you as much as
you would have hated to tell me...
anything like that.
Oh, there's just one more thing, dear.
I'd like to stay here...
until your father's on his way to california.
He's funny about things, you know.
He'd never believe that
the home was a grand place.
He's a l/ttle old-fash/oned, your father /s.
Those places seem terr/ble to h/m.
He must never know that i'm going.
And you tell cora and
nellie and the others...
that he must never know.
This is one thing that
has to be handled my way.
Yes, mother.
Just let h/m go on th/nk/ng...
that i'm l/v/ng w/th you and an/ta.
You can always forward my letters.
[Chuckles]
It'll be the first secret
i've ever had from him.
It'll
- it'll seem mighty funny.
[Chuckles]
Oh, well.
Here's another little secret...
just between us two.
You were always my favorite child.
Well, that's that.
As the years go by, you can
always look back on this day...
and be mighty proud of me.
Take it easy there.
[Rocker squeaking]
- Oh. Come in, mamie.
- Thank you.
- You going down to meet
the bus, huh? - Mm- hmm.
- And won't you be glad to see your husband?
- Yes, indeed.
Oh, mamie, you won't be here tonight
when i come back to get my things...
and i want to give you a little
remembrance i made for you...
and to thank you for everything.
Oh, thank you, mrs. Cooper, but for land's
sakes, there's nothing to thank me for.
Oh, i'll always remember
how nice you were to me.
Oh, by the way, mamie...
you'll be getting some
nights off from now on.
- [Chuckles] oh.
- I know.
Yessum. They even give me the afternoon off.
In fact, i'm going right
now to meet my husband.
So am i.
Yeah.
Will you stop lookin' at your watch?
We've got five whole hours.
We mustn't even think about the time.
I guess you're right, lucy.
Well, bark, i figure that everyone...
is entitled to just so
much happiness in life.
Some get it in the beginning,
and some in the middle...
and others at the end.
And then there are those
that have it spread thin...
all through the years.
The trouble is, i was a failure.
I suppose you liked me because
i knew a couple of jokes...
and could make you laugh.
I was the town clown...
but there wasn't much room
in the business world, lucy...
for that kind of a fella.
I won't let you call
yourself a failure, bark.
I think i slipped up someplace...
though i tried always...
to be a good wife and mother.
But if i'd been all that i thought i was...
things would be different now.
You don't sow wheat...
and reap ashes, pa.
Oh, come on.
Let's get out of here.
[Traffic no/ses]
[Wh/stle blows]
Excuse me a minute, ma. I want to
get something. I'll be right out.
[Horn honks]
[Horn honks]
[Wh/stle blows]
[Door bells j/ngle]
Come on, pa.
- They didn't have
my size. - Uh-huh.
- Fine time to tell us.
- Hmm.
You know, i always wanted
to buy you a nice car...
but it seems we always had to
use the money for something else.
- Do you see the old couple
standing out there? - Uh-huh.
It's always those kind that
have a million bucks salted away.
Well, i'm going out and pry
them loose from some of it.
[Chuckles]
If he's got a million bucks salted away,
i'll bet he's forgotten where he put it.
Uh, my name's ed weldon. Of course,
you don't know me from adam's father.
But you can judge
something of my character...
when i tell you i'm perm/tted
to represent th/s automob/le.
Of course, the car sells itself.
When i tell you it's considered
the mechanical wonder of the age...
you'll be surprised.
But when you ride in it and
find how smooth it runs...
you'll be astonished.
I don't expect we'll get to ride in it.
Well, why not? Have you
a little time right now?
Now, my car's r/ght there,
exactly l/ke th/s one.
How 'bout /t?
Oh, well, we couldn't. We're
having dinner with our children.
Well, but i can take you there.
Oh, no. You needn't bother about that.
A ride up the drive perhaps.
Oh, we couldn't, bark.
- Why not?
- Now, that's the proper spirit.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Well!
- Pretty nice, isn't it, bark?
- Yes, indeed.
- Are you warm
enough? - Uh-huh.
- Are you?
- Oh, yes.
I'm very comfortable.
- Say-
- weldon.
- Say, this is awful nice of you, mr. Weldon.
- That's nothing, mr. Cooper.
I only hope the children aren't
worried about us. You know, we really-
you remember-we took a ride up the hudson
when we came to new york on our honeymoon.
Of course i remember.
I always intended we should
do it again someday...
but we never got anywhere much
after our honeymoon, did we?
I guess this is the first time that
we've been away from home together...
since, uh...
our honeymoon.
It doesn't matter, bark. I had the children.
Yeah, and i used to go down to the
barbershop every night with the boys...
and left you at home to sew and -
i'm ashamed of myself, lucy.
I've been trying to recall the
places we went on our honeymoon.
We went to the theater twice, i remember.
Uh, three times. We went
to a matinee one day.
Oh, so we did.
And then we went to the
park to hear the band...
and we took a drive over brooklyn bridge.
- In a hansom cab.
- Mmm. On a thursday.
No, that was wednesday.
I can remember too.
Yeah. Never mind.
- Do you remember going to the museum?
- Of course i do.
You do not. You never went.
You said you didn't like museums.
[Both chuckling]
I wonder if the hotel
vogard is still standing.
Yeah, the vogard's on lower fifth avenue.
I remember it was a very
nice place run by nice people.
Say, lucy, what about going down and taking a look
at it and having a cup of tea? It'd do you good.
- Oh, no, bark. We couldn't.
- Why not? Who's to stop us.
- Well, the children
are - - mr. Weldon.
- I certainly can, mr. Cooper.
- He's gonna take us.
How do you like this car's
performance? Isn't it smooth?
Oh, it's perfect, mr. Weldon.
We never rode in a better
automobile in our life.
- Thanks.
- Have we, ma?
- My, it's nice to see it again.
- Yeah.
- How 'bout the car?
- Oh, it's fine.
You think you'd be interested
in buying a car like this?
In buying one?
Oh, we couldn't buy an automobile,
but we do appreciate the compliment.
Well, why not? A car's no longer a luxury.
It's, uh
- it's a necessity.
Why, were you expecting
to sell us an automobi -
- [bark chuckles]
- Oh, i'm so sorry we took your time.
Why, we thought that you were
really proud of your automobile...
and just sort of wanted to show it off.
Well, i'm glad you enjoyed it.
You know, i enjoyed myself too.
I didn't have anything to do.
In fact, you
- you were right in the first place.
I, uh
- [chuckles] I just wanted to show the car off.
Oh, well, that makes me feel
better. Thank you and good-bye.
You're more than welcome.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- We -we didn't touch
anything anyway. - No.
[Chattering]
[Small orchestra]
- Oh!
- [Chuckling]
- Oh.
- May i have your coat?
- Oh. Thank you.
- Did you see what i did?
Yes, dear.
I never was so embarrassed in all my life.
Well, get out. You were too.
I could tell you several times.
- [Laughs]
- Thank you.
Oh, i better get a check right here.
Could i have a check, please?
- Oh, you won't need one. I'll remember you.
- Oh, thank you.
You're strangers here, aren't you?
Well, not exactly.
We spent our honeymoon here 50 years ago.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Then you must remember this.
Our old lobby?
Remember, ma?
I should say we do.
It certainly is different than it was then.
Yeah. [chuckles] So are we.
- [All chuckling]
- [Bark] okay.
[No audible dialogue]
Well, what'll it be?
- Well, uh - -
cocktails maybe?
- Well, he's gonna have one.
- Certainly.
Well, why don't you have one, ma?
Ladies are drinking here.
- Oh.
- Yeah?
- Two cocktails. - What k-
how 'bout old-fashioneds?
Yeah. Two old-fashioneds for
two old- fashioned people.
- [Bark, bartender laugh]
- Say, that's all right.
Are you sure there's no calls for me?
Okay.
- Well, that's funny.
- No, it isn't.
That roast'll be ruined.
I don't care about the roast. I'm
worried about father and mother.
I wonder where they can be.
Ah, they're probably having a grand time...
talking about the few hours they
got left before pop's train leaves.
Some fun, huh?
Crenshaw hotel chain has owned the
vogard since shortly after the war.
- Oh.
- But that doesn't mean, mr. And mrs. Cooper...
we're not just as glad to see you as
the old management could have been.
Well, we just think it's awful nice
of you to bother to see us, mr. Norton.
- Ah, yes, indeed.
- Not at all. The hotel's friends are my friends.
Well, i never thought i'd be
sitting here, drinking like this.
You know, ladies never used to.
Why, you wouldn't believe it if i told you...
that on the first thursday we
were here on our honeymoon...
we just started for brooklyn bridge.
The aquarium, uh, was wednesday.
Ain't it funny how women always
get the weekdays mixed up...
along with other things?
It was wednesday.
I remember we started out.
I got lost right away.
- [Chuckling]
- But it was thursday.
Now, look, bark, we got married on -
- tuesday.
- [Chuckling] oh, no, no.
We were going to be married on
tuesday, and then we postponed it...
so my sister could get there
from new hampshire, remember?
- Mmm.
- She was snowbound, with the mumps.
- Hmm.
- [All laughing]
Uh, remember, she was visiting that
girl who was married to that fellow...
who was related to those people
who had a daughter in the south?
Without the mumps.
Well, the point is...
that we were married.
Yeah, we were married, all right.
[Laughing]
Well, the point is, we were married
on wednesday instead oftuesday.
N
- no. That's not the point at all.
We were trying to figure out
which day we went to the aquarium.
Oh. Well, that was thursday.
[Chuckling] I'm sure it
must have been, mrs. Cooper.
I wonder if you'll excuse me now.
If you want anything, just ask for it,
and let me know if you don't get it.
- Now, you shouldn't have done that.
- [Chuckling]
- It was my pleasure.
- Thank you, mr. Norton.
- [Crowd applaud/ng]

Was it wednesday?
Lucy, are you getting a little tipsy?
Let me hear you say this:
Betty botter bought a batch of bitter butter.
Betty botter bought a batch of bitter butter.
Now say this one: Betty
botter bought a batch...
of baby buggy rubber bumpers.
Betty botter bought a batch of baby bu -
you can't do it.
You got that one at the barbershop.
Yeah, i guess so. [Chuckles]
- Oh, bark, we've got to go.
- Why?
Well, the children are waiting,
and nellie's gonna cook dinner.
Well, we're not going. We're having fun.
And how many times have we
had to wait dinner for them?
I think i can fix it up.
In a nice way.
Hello. Hello, nellie.
This is your father. Remember me?
No, there hasn't been any accident...
except that we're having a good time.
Your dinner? [chuckles] Isn't that too bad?
No, i'm not fooling. No, we're not coming.
You heard me.
Oh, i'm sure you went to a
lot of trouble in cooking it.
Yeah, it sounds swell. A roast, eh?
- Bark.
- Uh -
- uh, wait a minute,
nellie. - Maybe we should -
excuse me, young lady. This is private.
[No audible dialogue]
- Was it all right?
- She took it very nicely.
Shall we join the others?
[Orchestra: Dramat/c]
- So, you're having dinner with us.
- Yeah, we thought we would.
That's fine. Step right upstairs.
I'll be in to see you later.
Thank you very much.
Better hurry along with your drink, mrs.
Cooper. Your husband and i are one up on you.
Oh, well, you go right ahead.
I kind of like to dawdle.
- Are you having a good time, lucy?
- Oh, yes, bark.
You wouldn't think, would you, to look at
her that she was a mother of five children?
- Not really.
- She's a grandmother too.
Oh! Well, that i just can't believe.
It's kind of hard for me to believe.
- Fifty years go by pretty fast.
- Only when you're happy.
- How many children have you?
- Five of'em.
Really? I'll bet they've
brought you a lot of pleasure.
- I'll bet you haven't any children.
- Don't you pay any attention to him.
Then i'm sure it was mrs. Cooper
who made the 50 years go so swiftly.
- Oh, that's very nice.
- Yes, it was.
Best thing i ever did, marrying her.
Randy dunlap was courting her
at the same time that i was.
- Oh, bark. Will you stop that?
- Well, he was. He proposed to you, didn't he?
Oh, yes, he did, but you
don't have to tell it.
I guess i looked like the
best bet, so she took me.
- Randy dunlap's the banker in our town.
- Really?
I got his girl, but he's got my house.
Go on!
Well, if you'll pardon me.
We've enjoyed having you.
- Yeah.
- Next time don't stay away so long.
- Good-bye, mr.
Norton. - Mrs. Cooper.

You know, lucy, i often wonder what i'd do...
if i was a young fella nowadays.
I guess i'd have to be a bachelor.
There are no girls around a man
would want to take a second look at.
Oh, shucks, bark. There are
plenty of mighty pretty girls.
Not as pretty as you. And you know what?
You've held your looks
better than anyone i know.
Ah.
Right now i don't see any girl
that looks half as nice to me...
as you do.
- Bark, you're sweet.
- So are you.
You know, the more i think of it,
the fella who wrote that poem -
- you know, your
favorite? - Mm-hmm.
I think he must have got
a peek into our future.
You know, the poem in the book
where you marked the place...
with a rosebud?
Or did the bank get that too?
They took the book, but they
couldn't take the poem from me.
"A man and a maid stood hand in hand...
"bound by a tiny wedding band.
"Before them lay the uncertain years...
"that promised joy, maybe tears.
"'Is she afraid? ' Thought
the man of the maid.
"'Darling,' he said in a tender voice...
"'tell me, do you regret your choice?
"'We know not where the road may wind...
"'or what strange byways we may find.
"Are you afraid? ' Said the man to the maid.
"She raised her eyes and spoke at last.
"'My dear,' she said, 'the die is cast...
"'the vows have been spoken,
the rice has been thrown.
"'Into the future we'll travel alone.
"With you,' said the maid...
'i'm not afraid."'
Would you like to dance, bark?
- Huh?
- It's a waltz.

[chuckles] Oh. That's funny, isn't it?
We've known all along that we're probably the most
good-for-nothing bunch of kids who were ever raised...
but it didn't bother us much until
we found out that pop knew it too.
- Doesn't look as though they're even coming by.
- No, i don't think so.
Well, we ought to be getting to the
station. How much time have we got?
- About a minute and a half.
- [Cora, nellie] what?
Well, two minutes maybe.
Two minutes? Why on earth didn't you tell us?
That wasn't a very nice thing to do, george.
I think so. I kind of thought
they'd like to be alone.
But if we don't go to the station,
they'll think we're terrible.
Aren't we?
You're tellin' us right, brother.
I can't understand what
happened to the children.
Right here?
Well, i
- i guess this is it.
- It looks like a very
nice train. - Uh-huh.
- I hear they serve very good food on trains.
- [Bell r/ngs]
Well, give addie my love...
and tell her to take good care of you.
Well, you'll very likely
see her soon yourself.
I'll get a job out there, and
i'll send for you right away.
I don't doubt that, bark. You'll
get a job. Of course you will.
- [Conductor] all aboard.
- They didn't give us much time, did they?
Good-bye, lucy dear.
Good-bye, darling.
- In case i don't see
you again - - what?
Well, anything might happen.
The train could jump off the track.
If it should happen that
i don't see you again...
it's been very nice knowing
you, miss breckenridge.
Bark, that's probably the
prettiest speech you ever made.
And in case i don't see you a
- [clears throat]
Well, for a little while...
i just want to tell you...
it's been lovely-
every bit of it...
the whole 50 years.
I'd sooner have been your wife, bark...
than anyone else on earth.
Oh, thank you, lucy.
[Conductor] All aboard!
Get going, pa.
