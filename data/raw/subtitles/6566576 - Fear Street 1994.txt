 "It began as a prank
and ended in murder."
Fantastic choice.
I love this one.
It's trash.
Low-brow horror.
It's for my stepdaughter.
That'll be $2.95.
Thank you for shopping at B. Dalton's.
And have a nice night.
Attention, shoppers.
The Shadyside Mall is now closed.
The Shadyside Mall is now closed.
Hello, this is B. Dalton's. We're closed.
OK, since when do you work late?
Since my mom used her last paycheck
on scratch tickets
instead of the gas bill.
Hello?
Ryan?
Ryan? Are you there?
Ryan? Hello?
Hello, Ryan!
Night.
- All alone now!
- Jesus Christ!
Woo-hoo!
Ryan! What the hell, dude!
Forgive me.
I do need a ride tonight.
That's what she said.
You are disgusting.
And, yes, I don't want to walk home alone.
Fine. Just give me and, uh… Jasmine here
15 minutes to close up.
You gave her a name.
Yeah, I thought, uh… "Big Tits"
was kind of deflating her ego.
- Ryan…
- What?
I didn't say anything, weirdo.
Hello?
OK. Very funny, asshole.
I'm spooked, OK? You win.
Ryan?
Ryan! Ryan!
Help!
Ryan!
Oh!
911, what's your emergency?
Hi, um… I'm in the Shadyside Mall.
Um…
Hello?
Hello?
Are you still there, ma'am?
Is someone hurt?
Ma'am, if you don't answer,
I'm gonna dispatch help.
Hey!
Help! Help!
Help!
Ah!
Ah, ah!
Ryan?
Please! It's me. It's me.
More death in Shadyside
while Sunnyvale enters its 30th year
with no violent crime.
{\an8}Killer Capital, USA,
as tragedy struck again.
{\an8}Sunnyvale football wins again!
Christina Marlow and Jessica Van
were found in a house
in a residential area near Shadyside.
They've been identified.
That's Sunnyvale!
{\an8}Shadysiders seem to have
no desire to better themselves.
Sunnyvale and Shadyside!
This just in!
More body parts found in the lake
between Shadyside and Sunnyvale.
{\an8}Sunnyvale voted
Most Beautiful Place to Live!
{\an8}Shadyside residents
{\an8}are spending another night hunkering down
in darkness as…
Find your new home in Sunnyvale,
where the sun always shines,
even when it's cloudy!
While the depression hit Shadyside hard,
the economy in Sunnyvale
continues to shine.
{\an8}According to sources
with the Shadyside Police…
Shadyside, small-town America.
But among locals, a history of horror
has earned it another nickname,
"Killer Capital USA."
- And last night, tragedy struck again.
- Ugh, Dad!
I'm here with Sheriff Nick Goode.
Sheriff, what can you tell us?
Uh, there were seven victims,
uh, ages, uh, 16 to 42.
Uh, the perpetrator's also deceased.
Shadyside sits just beside Sunnyvale,
one of the safest and wealthiest
communities in the country…
Josh!
What is it about Shadyside?
How do we end this cycle of violence?
Josh!
- Dude! What the hell?
- This isn't yours, dillweed!
Oh, I get it.
You building a shrine or something?
Alright, you know what?
It's time for school. Get in the car.
Let me finish this chat.
Deena, be careful with that!
Dad said you weren't allowed on this.
Know how expensive AOL is?
I'm stealing it. I'm talking to someone!
This internet bullshit
is exactly why you have no friends.
It's not bullshit.
It's a community dedicated to the truth.
Look, some guy went crazy and killed
a bunch of people at the mall last night.
Holy shit.
It was all over the news.
Skull mask killer.
But, of course, the media won't talk
about the most important part.
Josh, I am telling you calmly,
step out of your internet fantasy
nerd land and get in the car.
Step out your depressoid
"I'm gonna die alone" land,
and stop obsessing about Sam!
Get in the car!
See you later, Sir Silence.
Up, up, down, down.
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
Watch it, nerd.
Jeez.
You see? It's the witch.
Sarah Fier's back.
Oh, Christ. Not you too.
"She reaches from beyond the grave
to make good men her wicked slaves!"
- "She'll take your blood!"
- Simon!
"She'll take your head.
She'll follow you until you're dead!"
Wow!
You guys are dicks.
- It's just fun.
- It's sick.
What? The dude was wearing
a Halloween skull mask!
How is that not fun?
People died.
Heather died.
The dude was probably just some sad sack
who hated his life, like the rest of us,
except he decided, "Hey,
why don't I get out of here for good?"
And, "Hey, why don't I take Heather
and a couple other mall rats with me?"
There's no angry dead witch
who made him go postal.
The only thing that made him go crazy
is this town!
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Seems like…
maybe you got a little witch in you.
Dude, why are you even in here?
This is the girls' bathroom.
Candy store.
You know we don't believe
this witch shit, right?
It's just, like, fucked-up Santa Claus
or something.
Ho, ho, ho!
- What's this?
- I need you to give this to Sam tonight.
- Yeah, uh-uh. No way.
- Come on, Kate!
No way, Deena.
I am not getting mixed up
in your ex drama. Do it yourself.
I'm not going to the game. I quit band.
- Since when?
- Since who gives a shit!
Was band the only extracurricular
you had left?
You still have your band uniform, right?
You just wear that shit one last time.
I've got something
that'll give you the balls to face Sam.
What? You're dealing again? I thought you
stopped after this dingus's brother OD'd.
Timothy?
Wh… Uh… Timmy wasn't a real OD.
He didn't actually die.
They brought him back.
Ja-jing!
You're both morons.
Which one of us is valedictorian, again?
President of every club
this shithole has to offer.
I'm getting out of here. Off to claim
my place among the stars, bitch.
Woo! The witch lives!
Long live Sarah Fier!
Woo!
Woo!
Yeah!
Before tonight's game,
out of respect
for last night's tragic events,
Sunnyvale will host
a candlelight vigil for the victims.
All player, cheer and band attendance
is mandatory.
Oh, really? Come on!
Didn't you quit?
This isn't
how I wanted to be here tonight.
I wanted to be here as a fan.
Our Sunnyvale Devils
and your Shadyside Witches
throwing down
some good old American football.
Instead I find myself here
as a husband,
a father, as a neighbor.
And, yes,
mayor of Sunnyvale.
And on behalf of all of the people
in my town,
I say all of Sunnyvale mourns with you.
Yeah, really looks like they give a damn.
The only Sunnyvalers who came
were the ones who had to.
The football team and the cheerleaders.
Our hearts are broken with grief.
Sam.
I didn't think you were coming.
I thought you quit band.
Yeah, I did. Here.
What…
Is this my stuff?
Ding ding ding.
My family's been
in Sunnyvale for generations,
and now my brother is mayor
and I your sheriff.
We've prospered here.
And yet, I've seen you,
our neighbors in Shadyside,
suffer tragedy after tragedy.
It's easy in times like this
to drown in questions of why…
Why this happened.
But I know too well
there are no answers
that will provide relief.
There's no peace found in the past.
- Can we talk for a second?
- No.
You broke up with me! Remember?
So stop acting like I'm the bad guy.
Yeah, well, I'm not the one
who moved to Sunnyvale.
OK, you made the choice.
I just made it official.
My parents got divorced.
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, come on!
You just couldn't wait to start
your new fake life with your fake-ass mom!
I am half an hour away.
It might as well be the goddamn moon,
and you know it.
I don't know anything.
Yeah. Well, I do.
I know you were always too afraid
to tell anyone about us.
I know that.
And I know that douchebag out there
was squeezing your ass.
- You broke up with me.
- What's his name?
- You broke up with me!
- What's his name, Sam?
- The dude groping you.
- Stop. Stop!
- Touching you!
- Peter!
His name is Peter!
We must not fall into darkness.
We must look to the light.
Yeah!
What we should do is light a fuse
and burn down Shittyside.
What'd you say?
- You don't get it!
- No, no. I do.
There's not much of a future
in Shadyside with a lesbo.
Best case is what?
Dead on the mall floor
after a double shift,
or maybe, maybe if you're really lucky,
you're the one carrying the knife.
I said it ain't a tragedy
when it happens every week.
It's a joke.
Jesus. You're doing it again.
Doing what?
- "Welcome to the suck!" "Shit is doomed!"
- Shit is doomed!
It doesn't have to be.
- It's like you want to lose.
- At least I know who I am.
Stop being mad at me
for wanting a different future.
It's not your future
if you're pretending to be someone else.
Say that again, motherfucker!
Stop!
You little green prick!
Come here, you little bitch! Come here!
Suck it in...
- Pieces of shit!
- Yeah!
- They think they can do what they want!
- No!
They ruin our vigil,
then go waltzing back to their mansions,
like we're some reject pile
that they can step on!
No!
Well, we are not the reject pile!
- No!
- This shit ends tonight!
- Yeah!
- What are we gonna do?
We're gonna go kill those preppy assholes!
Yeah!
Kate! Kate! Kate!
Kate! Kate!
When I say Shady, you say side!
- Shady!
- Side!
When I say Shady, you say side!
- Shady!
- Side!
When I say Shady, you say side!
- Shady!
- Side!
Goddamn Sunnyvalers.
Yeah! Where are you going?
Guys! Come here! Come here!
- Shady!
- Side!
Woo!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hey, isn't that, uh…
Sam.
Where are you going, you pussies?
Sunnyvale sucks!
- Peter, stop! What are you doing?
- Chill out!
Open the door!
Open the door!
This is definitely a good idea, right?
Deena?
On three, OK?
- Are you sure?
- One, two…
- Deena!
- What?
Your nose!
Stop! Stop the bus!
Whew.
Shit, are you alive?
Yeah, I'm alive. Yeah.
Sam! What… what are you doing?
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Are you OK? Oh!
I'm so… I'm sorry.
Stay away from her, you bull dyke freak!
Sam, it's me. I'm here.
Did you… see?
What?
Oh shit!
OK, we should not be down here.
- Shut up, help me carry her!
- We need to leave, like ten minutes ago.
- We have to clear her airway.
- Quit it!
Hey! I got this. Chill out.
I got this.
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.
See? She's fine.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh. Ugh!
What the fuck?
- Deena Johnson?
- Yeah, two E's.
Wanna tell me what happened?
The car crashed.
Was it pursuing you?
Well, it was driving behind the bus.
Does that count as pursuing?
The driver said that before the crash
someone opened the emergency exit.
I don't remember that.
No?
He also saw you with the cooler.
Did anyone else see that?
Maybe you were just, um… goofing around.
Things got out of hand.
- Why don't you tell me what happened?
- I don't know.
I guess…
Sometimes accidents just happen.
We lost control, sir.
Freak accident.
Suck it, pig.
It was just an accident.
Alright.
Well, if you do think of anything,
give me a call.
I'm on your side.
Yeah, totally.
My car is totaled.
Well, Daddy will buy you a new one.
Shittyside trash.
You are all fucking… dead.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Yeah?
Do it before Dad gets here,
he's gonna murder you!
You know the cops called him at work
about some accident last night?
Please get out of my room.
You get out of your room.
You've been in your bed all day!
Get up!
I'm here
with Martin P. Franklin,
Shadyside Mall Janitor.
- Martin, what do you know?
- He was a normal dude.
Always thought he would, like, just go
home and read a comic book or whatever.
He was chill, just snapped I guess.
A baffling development
as mall employee Ryan Torres
has been identified as the killer.
A recent graduate of Shadyside High
an ordinary guy who,
as those who knew him attest,
just seemed to snap.
East Union Medical.
Hi. Uh, Samantha Fraser's room, please?
Josh! Get the door!
- Hello?
- Uh… Hi, uh, Mrs. Fraser.
I'm sorry. Uh, Miss… Ms…
Hi, um…
Is Sam there? I just…
- I wanted to see how she was doing.
- Deena?
Yeah. Hi.
I was just w… worried about her and...
You won't stop until you've
ruined her life completely, will you?
She's fine. Don't call here again.
Josh!
Hello?
Oh, hey, Peter!
See you got the full costume now!
Hey!
- Pizza ready?
- Oh, that ringing you heard.
What?
I have priorities.
Jeez.
Shit! Hot, hot, hot!
Sunnyvale prick.
Holy shit!
Stay here.
You're pathetic!
Four in each bag.
If you finish in an hour,
I'll let you watch
My So-Called Life with me.
And, uh, do not eat these.
These will make your little hearts stop,
you'll choke to death on vomit
and everyone will be so, so super sad.
Got it?
Bob, easy with that blood.
It's our last can!
What happened to sorting this?
Lights and darks,
and watch for stray socks.
- Remind me what's in it for me again?
- Nope.
You still wearing
the clothes from last night?
Did you wear that to the grocery store?
I had to work a double shift
and this was all I had in the car.
So, yes. Yes, I am.
Oh.
That's disgusting. You're disgusting.
- Alright, kiddo?
- There I was at ten…
Hey, lady-killer.
Where are you?
Babysitting. Look out the window.
That prick Peter is screwing with me.
Sam's boyfriend? What the hell?
Yeah, he's creeping around our house
in one of those skull masks. It's fucked.
I gotta go. Call you back.
Jesus! Put something on!
What? Make up your mind, woman!
Stay here.
- Maybe this isn't a good id...
- Shh!
Hey, creeper. What the f...
- Are you crazy?
- It's just that Sunnyvale asshole.
Thank you so much.
Oh, no. I'm so happy to have the company.
- You're a lifesaver, Mrs. Lane.
- I used to be a nurse.
Are you… you sure everything's OK?
Totally! I just have to run out and…
Kill that pervert!
Why would he break in there?
I just don't understand what he was doing.
He was acting all shifty and shit.
Like going through the laundry.
You need to get some groceries, man.
- We have an incredible sale at the store...
- He broke into the house! He had a knife!
Whoa! With the kids there? That's wack!
That's fucking right, Josh.
It is wack. Thank you.
There were kids there. OK, and what?
He thinks because he's balling Sam,
he can come and prank us on our own turf.
Hey, you know what?
You're right. Fuck this.
- Fuck Peter.
- Hello?
Don't forget the most important part.
Fuck Sam.
Yeah, fuck her. She needs to get
her psycho boyfriend in check.
Oh!
You coming or what?
Hey, slow down, lover boy!
- Fill these out and take a seat.
- No, I'm just visiting.
Visiting hours ends at nine.
Tell Nurse Beddy she has a patient.
Beddy. Long time, how you been?
- Still toting around with this moron.
- She can't quit me, Beddy. Too pretty!
Listen, we need your assistance.
I'm sure that you do, but there happens
to be a new security protocol.
We kept coming up short
on blueberries and bananas.
- So now I need a special key...
- I need to see a patient.
Blueberries and bananas?
Vicodin and Percocet.
You want anything from the machine?
I'm starving.
Cute sweatshirt.
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?
I honestly have no clue.
Oh, Jesus. This game?
- What game? What are you talking about?
- About your dipshit boyfriend.
- He threatened, "You're all fucking dead."
- That didn't mean anything.
Now tonight, he's stalking around,
messing with us.
He broke into the house
where Kate was babysitting.
No. Peter's been here.
You need to call him
and tell him to back off.
Good news. They're gonna transfer
you out of this shithole tomorrow.
Perfect timing, asshole.
Where's your stupid mask?
Yo, Si-Money. Cash me.
Don't look at me, dude.
I'm… I'm… I'm broke.
You got any change?
Oh, um…
Let me check.
Um…
Uh… Uh, no.
Uh, but I…
What do you want?
He has been with me all night!
- Stop covering for him! He's a bad guy.
- You're out of control!
You put me in the hospital!
Now you're here yelling at me...
OK. No, that was an accident.
Look, I got a nosebleed.
- I didn't actually mean...
- A nosebleed? Stop making excuses!
You are total chaos!
And you have always been!
So don't blame me when you wake up
in ten years just like your dad!
Old and drunk and going nowhere!
OK, first, go to hell.
Second, yeah.
Congrats on getting out of Shadyside, Sam.
All you had to do was suck it up,
literally, and swallow some Sunnyvale...
You know what?
I never want to see you again!
Great. Have a nice goddamn life!
Oh my God!
- Where'd you learn how to do this?
- Oh, a lot of people trade hacks online.
Nerd.
So, um…
…when'd you get into the fruit business?
What?
Um… The, uh… drugs.
Oh, that's just temporary.
Saving up to get out of here.
Take me with you.
Run!
Did they get back together?
Tonight's Unsolved Mysteries,
the story of a lonely housewife…
- Where are the keys? Do you have the keys?
- No!
Where… where are the keys?
Come on. The ambulance!
- No!
- You can't wear that mask. What are...
Look out!
Come on!
- Come on! Let's go!
- Come on!
What the…
Mall employee
Ryan Torres has been identified
as the killer in the mall massacre.
Deena! Come on! Deena!
- Deena! Hurry up! Let's go!
- Go! Go!
- We have to go now!
- Hurry!
You have access to the mall.
You are still employed there, correct?
I'mma tell you again.
Somebody planted that.
Those ain't my cans.
You're right, Martin. These…
are actually my cans.
Why would I tag my own place of work?
Come on, man!
Martin, around here,
people show a little respect.
They call me Sheriff Goode.
Sheriff Goode?
More like Sheriff motherfucking Evil!
I'm telling you, it was him!
The psycho killer
my colleague shot dead, huh?
Yes! That's what we keep saying!
- What's wrong with you?
- Officer Kapinski.
You told me to come to you.
We should not be this close to
the police station in a stolen ambulance.
We're hiding in plain sight.
Yeah, just like Bundy.
Ted Bundy, when he was stalking
his victims, I mean.
OK, didn't he get caught though?
- Well, no. Well, yeah, but...
- Figure this out. I'm gonna take a leak.
Why do you know so much about killers?
Know thy enemy, right?
- You hang onto any of that candy?
- Yeah.
Then his mask came off.
And you saw him?
Yeah. Yeah, the mall killer, Ryan Torres.
That's Ryan Torres.
Yes!
Yes, that's him.
I know, but you guys must have made
a mistake or something. Look…
- I know what I saw.
- OK.
Let me get the right paperwork.
"Dead killer chasing…"
Would you say he was more, uh,
Dawn of the Dead
or Night of the Living Dead?
Wait.
- You don't believe us?
- This was a waste of time.
We've had prank calls, we've had reports
of skeleton mask copycats all weekend.
Got a call from the hospital.
Lady sounded worked up.
Uh… wait, I'll… I got it.
Take care of them.
This is bullshit. There are bodies
at the hospital. You're gonna see...
Honey, we are so appreciative of this tip.
- The killer is still out there!
- We'll do our damnedest to catch him.
You're a monster!
You're supposed to protect us!
Hey, hey! Young lady, do not test me!
I'm so sorry, sir.
I have no idea what came over me.
Get out of here!
Go find your boyfriends!
Tell them you need to relax!
Hey.
Do… do you need help? What the…
Deena, slow down!
- What are you doing?
- Just walk, fast.
We need to leave.
I think we should stay. We're safe here.
What if that psycho shows up again?
- Then we'll be ready.
- What the hell?
Deena, what is that?
Is that the cop's? You stole a cop's gun?
Fuck yeah she did!
- You out of your goddamn mind?
- They didn't believe us.
We're on our own.
Where the hell is Simon?
Simon, come on!
- Come on!
- Go! Go! Let's go!
Go! Come on!
- Come on!
- Sam! Come on! Run!
It doesn't make sense.
It's… it's not possible.
- Bullets didn't stop her.
- Amazing observation.
- Who the hell was that?
- How the hell should I know? She…
She was hot! I don't know!
The bitch seemed normal!
I hate to break it to you,
but normal bitches
don't bleed black fucking blood!
Well, she was hot and normal
until she attacked me
with a fucking razor blade!
Wait. What… A razor?
Yeah, for like old-timey shaving,
or in this case, I guess, slitting her...
Wrists. She slashed her wrists.
Was she singing something?
Was she singing a song, like an oldie…
like an oldie song?
Jesus, Rain Man.
How the fuck do you know that?
This is Ruby Lane.
- The girl who attacked you.
- Holy shit!
She sang as she murdered her boyfriend,
her friends, then she killed herself.
Slashed her wrists.
Jesus. Yeah, why didn't I see this
on the news?
Because it happened 30 years ago.
1965.
Ruby is one of Shadyside's killers,
just like Skull Mask.
Ryan? Please!
I mean Ryan Torres.
Look, 1978.
Sixteen years ago.
- "Masked psycho murders kids at..."
- Camp Nightwing.
Yeah, my mom's sister was there.
That screwed my family up for a long time.
1950,
Harry Rooker,
local milkman slashes
a bunch of housewives.
1935, Humpty Dumpty Killer.
1922, Billy Barker.
1904, Grifter guts girls, and on and on.
It happens in Shadyside over and over.
Normal people turn into psychos.
Jesus.
Look at this guy.
That's the pastor, Cyrus Miller.
1666. He was the first one recorded.
He, um… killed kids
and cut out their eyes.
Sam?
I, uh, brought you…
- I always liked this sweater.
- Yeah, I know.
If you get blood on it, I'll kill you.
What's happening to us?
There are people trying to kill us.
Dead people,
if you believe my weirdo brother.
That's not what I meant.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I know I always give you shit
for pretending you're someone you're not,
but it's…
It's not really easy for me to…
you know, be like us… either.
- Are you giving me a pass?
- No.
Fine. I'm not gonna say
what I was gonna say.
Say it.
Maybe you're… you're right.
Maybe shit is doomed.
I mean, here we are.
We're together for one night and...
Dead people are trying to kill us.
None of this is random.
It's Sarah Fier.
She's turning Shadysiders into killers.
Do you really believe that?
No one actually thinks
that this witch shit is real.
Yeah, it's something babysitters make up
to scare kids.
No, no. Just listen to me.
1666, Sarah Fier was hanged
for witchcraft, fact.
But ever since she was executed,
she's been possessing people,
turning them into killers,
to take revenge on the town.
- It's like the nursery rhyme.
- Yeah. Yeah.
"Before the witch's final breath,
she found a way to cheat her death."
"By cutting off her cursed hand,
she kept her grip upon our land."
"She reaches from beyond the grave
to make good men her wicked slaves."
Yes, exactly.
Don't you see what's happening to us?
This is all proof.
Shadyside isn't just
some hotbed for psychos.
All these massacres are connected
to Sarah Fier.
The witch's curse is real!
Fine. Let's assume that the witch
has been possessing people
for some sort of messed-up vendetta.
This isn't the same as the mall massacre.
Something different is happening to us.
Something way worse.
OK, we have two of her killers after us
and both of them are dead.
Why is she so mad at us?
I saw her.
Last night, I don't…
I don't know, you know.
I thought I hit my head…
It was…
It was her.
I saw the witch.
I can't believe you're wearing that.
Can't believe you're above it,
when we're in the middle
of the fucking woods
and dead maniacs are after us.
OK, so I fell out of the car…
here.
I was crawling,
and my nose was bleeding.
And then…
I feel something.
Chains?
Oh! Not just chains.
- Holy shit.
- Oh my gosh.
- No way.
- Oh!
Fier. It's her.
It's her grave.
Oh no, no. No!
This is bad! This is really bad!
No wonder the witch is pissed at us.
I'd be pissed too.
Sam disturbed her grave.
Now she's sending
her henchmen after us.
Henchmen?
As in every one of those sickos
on your wall is coming after us?
Did you hear that?
Hold up. Hold up.
She's mad
because we disturbed her grave, right?
Yeah. So?
So, let's un-disturb it!
Just put the bones back, rebury them,
and put her to rest!
No, that's so stupid!
That's genius!
Yeah! In… in Poltergeist!
Whatever.
Let's do it quickly so we can go.
OK.
Deena, Deena!
Find something to wrap her bones!
You! It's you!
It's you!
Your nose…
Guys?
I think there's someone in the woods!
It's you!
It's you!
We need to hurry!
There, there.
We're sorry.
Did it work?
Did it work?
- No!
- It's you!
Go, run!
Run! Run!
Go! Come on, go!
Start the car! Go!
- That was the Camp Nightwing Killer!
- That was a bust!
Yeah, maybe because
it's not like the movies, OK?
It's not as easy as putting bones to rest!
- It should've worked. It always works!
- Maybe it's her missing hand.
Who gives a shit? It doesn't matter.
Hey, how do I not die?
We! How do we not die!
And I'm looking at you, witch nerd!
- I… I don't know!
- They're not coming for us!
- They're coming for me.
- What?
- I saw her again…
- It's you.
The witch. She… I disturbed her grave.
- It's you.
- She wants me.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Nightwing ran right by me.
I jumped out his way, it was like
he didn't even see me. He went for her.
Guys, no! Ruby attacked Simon.
Skull Mask came after us at home.
And while you guys were babysitting!
No, he didn't.
Skull Mask didn't care about us.
He wanted this. Sam's blood.
- What the fu…
- Oh!
Yeah! From the crash
when Sam puked period!
It's Jaws, dude!
A shark smelling blood!
Kate's right!
When we found Skeletor,
he was all sniffy and weird with my shirt
like a perv in a pantie shop!
Yeah, but he came to our house too!
Deena…
Sam bled on her bones,
now the witch wants more of her blood!
OK, so what do they do in Jaws?
They didn't go skinny-dipping
with the goddamn bait.
She's not bait!
Yeah. She is.
Seriously, if we're right
and they're after her…
let's give these assholes what they want.
Alright, we have to decontaminate.
You can't have any of Sam's blood on you.
Well, not much I can do about that.
Deena, you have to get clean too!
Not a single drop, OK?
Rub-a-dub-dub time!
Hey, wait.
I don't want to go in by myself.
Up, up, down, down.
Left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
Holy shit, your shoulder.
It's fine.
OK, well,
fine or not, we s… still need to cover it.
Do you really think
this is going to work?
I do.
Josh…
Can you help me?
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.
When I went to Sunnyvale,
I ran away from you.
Because you were, like…
this reminder.
I was scared of this.
Of us.
Of me.
And, like, tonight's been the first time
I've felt like myself in…
months.
It's been so long.
I forgot what that… what that felt like.
You make me feel…
like me.
Yeah.
I think you're all good.
What if…
What if tonight's it for us?
Did you hear that?
No!
Calm down.
It was barely first base.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Did you… all go to pound town?
Me too!
Ready?
The trap is simple.
We set the bait.
The killers go to the blood.
Then…
Smile, you son of a bitch!
Are you sure you want to do this?
See you on the other side.
Dude! She's here! I saw her!
She was…
She was so sexy, but fucking crazy still!
She was doing it!
Following the blood trails!
It's working.
Skull Mask freak, three o'clock.
Ruby.
This is so dumb.
If this doesn't work, I will murder you!
They're all here.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come back from that, motherfuckers!
Oh!
Guys?
Holy!
Run! Run!
Go! Go!
Help me!
- They're coming!
- They're gonna keep coming!
We're fucked!
No, no! We are not fucked!
She's fucked. They're coming for her.
If we put Sam in the hall,
we end this now.
- You're a monster.
- I'm being reasonable!
We can't run anymore.
A bullet won't stop them, fine.
They're really strong.
But we just tried to goddamn explode them,
and that didn't work!
You're suggesting killing her.
I mean, that's not exactly
what she's saying.
Oh, you're on her side?
You'd let us all die to protect her.
Look at this.
OK, all of this.
Dead, dead, dead!
This is the way.
It's the only way.
Sam's gotta go.
Are you kidding me?
Kate's right.
I don't want you guys to die for me.
I'm going.
I'm ending this.
No, you're not.
Are you crazy?
No.
No, Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Let me go! Let me… Sam!
Let me go. Let me go!
Let me… Help me! Help!
We're letting her die!
We're killing her!
Please!
This is not your fault.
Please!
Please!
- What… what… what is going on?
- You're not doing this alone.
There's another way.
C. Berman.
She's the key.
Camp Nightwing. Summer of '78.
Group of campers, brutal massacre.
There was one Shadyside survivor,
C. Berman.
"The still traumatized girl claims that
amidst the carnage she saw the witch."
Yeah, just like you.
So, if she survived, I'm pretty sure...
There may be a way for me to live too.
I got it! C. Berman!
9006 Brennan Way.
This has gotta be her!
Uh, 155-4747!
- No one's answering!
- The Berman residence.
- I'm not home right now.
- I need some help here!
- Please leave a message after the beep.
- No one's there!
Hello, my name is Deena Johnson.
I think you saw the witch.
This shit is not gonna hold!
We need to know how you survived!
Hey! We're being attacked, alright?
There are killers here!
If you're there, please pick up!
Please answer!
- To record a new message, press one.
- Fuck! No!
Help!
- Help us!
- Help!
She died.
She died.
What? No, she's alive.
That's the whole point.
Yeah, she… she survived, but…
but first she died.
"C. Berman was found
in the woods."
"Her heart had stopped
but local boy performed CPR."
What if this is it?
What if that's how she survived?
Her heart stopped.
She survived by dying.
What is it? The fucking rhyme.
The fucking rhyme!
"She'll take your blood,
she'll take your head!"
- "She'll follow you..."
- "Until you're dead."
It's just like Kate said. OK?
The witch wants you dead.
So… we kill you.
And then, just like this C. Berman bitch,
we bring you back to life.
What are you saying?
Fuck it. I'm dying tonight
one way or another.
Let's try to bring me back.
Let's do it!
Let's Timothy this bitch!
A few months ago, my brother Timothy
had an unfortunate experience
in which he ingested too much
of a certain substance.
He was dead for two minutes.
But…
we got him back!
Kate.
It's time for your close-up.
You need to take these in order.
Pile one takes the edge off.
You're gonna feel like
you're being fucked by a unicorn.
Pile two is gonna bring
your core temp way down.
You may feel slightly sick.
You need to take a five-minute interval
between pile two and pile three.
That's really important, OK?
Pile three brings you down and out,
so take that "take five"
or it's all gonna go to shit!
- How many do we have?
- Tons. Like a thousand.
Wait. EpiPens?
Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.
This is what brings her back.
This is Jesus!
Sam's blood marks the spot.
Remember half an hour ago,
when you wanted to murder me?
You don't have to do this. You can leave.
Remember when you decided
to sacrifice yourself for us?
We're ending this together.
Die well, my friend.
We got back door patrol.
Hey!
I'll run interference up here.
OK, I got stock room.
You take the emergency exit.
Whoa! No, no, no!
Splitting up is not a good idea at all.
But, dude, listen to me.
I know that this is all fucked,
but… we gotta do this.
Kate,
she's a crusher.
She doesn't have time for most people.
I know.
She's being nice
because we're probably gonna die.
No! OK, well…
maybe we're gonna die,
but Kate is not nice.
She sees something in you.
- So?
- So, see that in yourself, dude.
We would not be this far
if it weren't for you.
Now we have to keep those psychos
away from Sam.
So go…
…man up,
and check that exit.
Deena.
Deena.
What if we fuck up and just kill me?
What if you can't bring me back?
Listen to me.
When you left,
I saw it all.
My whole future,
my whole life in Shadyside.
A night shift, a day shift,
and a million empty beer cans,
just like my dad.
No way out.
But tonight, even though we are in hell,
I feel like I have
another chance with you.
And I'm not gonna lose you again.
Because you, and we,
are the way out.
When this is all over,
I am gonna take you on a date.
We're going to eat cheeseburgers
and listen to the Pixies,
and make out and have
the best night of our goddamn lives.
But right now, you've got to die.
Now, look at me. Look at me.
I am going to bring you back.
Swallow it. Swallow it.
Swallow it. Swallow it.
Oh, come on!
Come on!
I'm so sorry.
- It's OK. It's OK.
- I'm so sorry.
- Look.
- Huh?
Look. Behind… behind you!
Go! Go! Go!
Go!
Oh!
I need to die. I need to die.
I'm gonna figure this out!
Go, go!
No! No!
No!
No!
No!
Finish it.
No! No!
Do it! Do it! Do it! Come on!
No! No! No!
No! No!
No! No!
Go! She's right behind me!
Come on, Sam!
Come on, Sam!
No! No!
Sam?
Josh, Josh! Come help me! Get the pens!
Get the pens!
Help me! Go get the EpiPens!
Come!
Come, hurry!
Sam!
Here, here, here!
Are you doing it right?
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't think it's working.
It has to work! It has to.
It has to. Sam?
Sam?
Everyone's dead.
Simon…
Kate…
No. No, Sam!
I will not let you do this.
Come on!
Come on.
Come on, Sam.
One, two, three.
Come on, Sam.
Come on. Come on, Sam!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
It's over.
It's over.
It's OK.
It's over. It's over.
Interview with Deena Johnson.
Sunday, October 2nd, 1994.
Wanna tell me what happened?
We were picking up Sam's prescription.
And the lights went out.
It was pitch black.
I couldn't really see anything.
We ducked behind a counter.
We hid until it was over.
How'd you get that?
I fell on some glass.
Fell on some glass.
You had 15 stitches
in your shoulder.
I fell on some glass.
Sam, you look like a ghost.
Like you just came back from the dead.
Shock, I guess.
I'll tell you what the facts tell me.
- The junkies...
- Kate and Simon?
They weren't junkies.
They were my friends.
They're to blame for everything.
That feels too easy to me.
But that's the story
this department will go with
unless you can help me
to see it differently.
Another Shadyside tragedy.
An underprivileged overachiever
with bright prospects.
A guy who's been supporting
his family alone since he was 15.
Both succumbing
to the quick cash of drugs.
Fits the narrative, right?
Nice and neat.
You came here for my help.
I should have listened to you. I'm sorry.
I'm listening now.
But there's nothing else to say.
Do you want your friends
going down for this?
No.
But they're dead.
Hey.
Urkel. Help me out?
Oh, OK.
So I'm a bad guy because I'm in here.
Then that makes you a bad guy, too,
little man.
Let's go.
I owe you.
Anything comes to you, call me.
Prodigal son returns.
Man, you ain't my family.
Sam!
Samantha!
So I guess I'll…
see you tomorrow?
No.
See you tonight.
Come on!
More death in Shadyside.
A drug-fueled night of violence
leaves a trail of bodies.
Melissa, give us a recap.
There are
three dead at East Union Medical…
I, uh… I wanted…
I wanted to give you this the other day.
- But, uh...
- What is this?
Um…
- A mixtape?
- Yeah.
But you don't have to open it right now.
I knew it.
Josh, someone's at the door!
Josh!
What?
You ordered dinner?
Yeah, it's not a big deal.
Just some pizza.
Ah! Stop! Don't be weird!
Hello?
Hello?
Alright. Listen, asshole.
Don't call here...
You're still alive!
Who is this?
- Sam…
- You called me.
Wanted to know how I survived
the Camp Nightwing Massacre.
C. Berman.
Did you touch the bones?
Did you see her face?
- No. It's over.
- Over?
Yeah, but, uh…
thanks for your prompt reply.
- It's not over.
- Sam…
It's never over.
We ended it.
We stopped the killers.
But you haven't stopped her.
You can't.
She makes the rules.
Who?
The witch.
She'll do whatever it takes.
You're not safe.
She'll find a way.
She'll come for you.
Sam.
Stop it! Get off!
Sam! Sam!
Stop! Stop!
Sam!
Don't! It's me!
It's me! It's me!
What the…
Sam's not feeling like herself.
We have to get her back.
I'm going to get you back.
The witch…
The town curse…
I thought there was a way to end it.
But now I know
there is no end.
This is July 12th.
Summer of 1978.
The first day of camp.
A week later…
my sister was dead.
