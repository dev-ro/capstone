- Well?
- I don't much remember.
Well, I mean that's...
you were just a baby.
- Can you, daddy?
- No, I've never been here before.
I was...
was shooting last time you guys came.
The house looks like...
- ... a castle
- Aah! It does.
Yes, even though there's a prison
just behind it.
A turtle! A turtle!
- Dad, look!
- Well, he's name's Pierre.
- He's a granddad.
Hey, we're not scary, pal!
There he goes.
And what does he eat?
- Lettuce.
- Lettuce?
He eats lettuce.
Yeah, well she had a maid...
but, she quit last month.
- Too bad, she was a good woman.
- Why did she quit?
Oh! Probably because she is a good woman.
Hey, Charlotte.
- You gonna sleep in my old bedroom, okay?
 - Yeah!
Yeah! So...
You want some help with the bags?
- You want?
- No thanks.
- Okay!
- I'm not a baby anymore.
At the very top of the stairs...
... go on the right and then straight!
- Okay.
- Okay?
At the very top...
... right and..
... and...
... straight!
Haven't seen you since the wedding.
Welcome, Hank.
Is your first visit here.
Yeah, last time ...
last time I was on a shooting, so...
Oh... It doesn't matter.
It's not so much fun to visit
 your wife's house.
Well, this is a beautiful home.
Yes, well... 
- ... even though there is a prison just behind it.
- Yeah, right!
100,000 copies?
- That's huge!
- That's huge, imagine that!
Welcome!
- He wants some... He wants some wine.
- Some wine! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Can I come? 
- Yes, yes.
You didn't have any wine yesterday.
No, I...
... I quit.
Out of superstition?
Or maybe you're waiting
for leading role?
Maybe, yeah...
No...
- It's good to have dreams in life...
- Yeah.
Sometimes it's easier to not have any...
Lumir?!
Eh... That's my father!
Yeah. I'm, I'm Hank,
I'm Lumir's husband.
We find us a brand new recipe...
I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence...
And find me one...
Ouch... My hands!
There. 
Here we go.
- Can I do it a little bit?
- No, you don't have to.
- Oh yeah. Easier.
- Right?
I'm going to put it here.
- You know the traitor.
- Gas... Gaspard.
- I don't like him.
- Gaspard's the traitor.You don't like him?
 I don't like him either.
He gives me a bad feeling.
- Your character was shot in the head...
- No, he didn't.
- And he will ...
- No, he didn't say it...
- ... not survive!
- You didn't think I was shot in the head?
- That's what he's saying!
- No. No. No.
- I was shot in the shoulder.
- In the shoulder?
Yeah, not in the head.
The blood it went boom and then...
No, it is very clear.
I can't believe that.
Your wife married again before you get out.
I don't know, they don't show me the script.
I promise, I would tell you if I knew,
 but I don't know.
- They don't tell me anything.
- Never.
They're offering you many other parts.
Oh yeah! It's the first time I've ever gotten
offered a part...
--- without having the audiction, you know?
So that's kind of a big deal for me...
... I'm finally starting to make it as an actor.
Oh, no, no...
Is it an imitation?
You didn't see it?
Fabienne was really spectacular.
She was ...
Charlotte! 
Why don't you head to bed, hein?
You've been great tonight, honey.
- Lumir... 
- Stay out of this, please. Mind your business.
Yes.
Yes and then...
we need to switch scene 47...
and at the 74rd scene.
That will make the lover character
scarier, I think.
Thank you very much for that conversation.
It was...
... most enlightning.
Mercy beaucoup.
Do you really intend to come tomorrow?
- Why else would I come to Paris
- Fine.
- We leave at 11.
- Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Jesus...
Your mother didn't kiss me...
Not here... 
Not here.
But here. Right here.
How many glasses did you have?
How many in a bottle?
Why did you tell them you were quitting drinking
until you lead a leading role?
I... I never said that, I...
- Please don't start drinking again.
- I didn't, that's not what I said. I said I'm not.
- I'm so sorry. I... No, you don't have... 
- Are we gonna go back to the same nightmare?
I'm sick of lying to Charlotte and
telling her you're away on a shooting.
- I know. I'm sorry! I know.
- Stop. 
- Done.
- What did you talk about for two hours?
You don't even speak French.
I bet all she did was brag.
She seemed sad to me, actually.
- Really?
- Yeah, she did.
Very sad.
I didn't know you'd come here
just to see my mother act.
You didn't? 
Well, I'm a big fan. I'm a really big fan.
You know you can go instead of me,
with all her tea making it.
Yeah. You know I don't like tea.
You know...
Why did you bring me here? Hein?
Why?
Well, If you really wanna do this talk
 about her book, why did you bring me here?
Well, because last time I came,
you were in rehab, if you remember...
I know, but I think that you wanted
 to make her jealous.
Show her our happy family.
But that's not gonna be good jealous.
You're not gonna beat her with that.
And you're not gonna beat her with...
a second rate American TV actor.
I'm gonna have a little nap, okay?
I'll be right here if you need me.
She's saying you didn't have to come.
Oh no! A promise is a promise.
Why bother coming to Paris, otherwise?
She really said that?
Oh! Right!
What advice can I give her?
- Nothing, you don't have to say anything.
- Yes but... I told you.
Don't! Trust me.
Sometimes you just need...
- Do you feel sorry for grandma?
- No. She was cool.
Yes, she was cool, that's for sure.
I want to see you act.
- Do you wanna see me act?
- Yeah!
- Really?
- Yeah!
That's nice.
Yeah, you should come sometime.
Anytime you want!
- If I don't have school.
- If you don't have school, exactly.
- If mommy let me go.
- Yeah...
- Do you want to go to bed?
- No, I like listening to you.
What are you working on?
I'm writing something for my mother.
Fabienne's theme.
Let's make this paper turn into
 a wild hand.
- It's moving!
- Right. It's cool. Don't touch it! Are you nuts?
- Is it moving?
- What do you mean 'is it moving'? It's alive!
- Can you touch with baby finger?
- Yes! Don't touch it. Are you nuts?
- Oh yeah! Are you kidding?
- It's cause you're right.
- I wonder where she is, I hope it all goes well.
- Yeah...
Anyway, I enjoyed doing it.
Yeah? Maybe she's writing
 something real for you, you know?
A play or screenplay.
- And you could be in it too!
- Yeah? Who would I play?
- A lover, maybe!
- No! Oh no!
Yeah!
- No, no, no.
- But it wouldn't work out.
Why not?
Because then she would turn you
in an animal!
- What kind of animal?
- A pig!
A pig?
- An eagle.
- An eagle?
Sorry!
What else could it be?
- Yeah, an eagle is good!
- Yeah, an eagle is good?
An eagle!
Higher! 
Higher!
Fly!
Ah! I'm stuck here.
I'm stuck here.
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Boom!
Go!
I got you!
What would you like to hear
at the Paris gate?
- She just don't wanna say it.
- What do you think it is?
