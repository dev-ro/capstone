Out, out, out!
Come on, move. Move!
On the double!
Double double double!
-- Come on, you special boys!
-- Move it!
You black bastard...move it!
Over there!
You. In.
Get up straight, boy.
Attenshun.
Name and number.
4737, Carlin, sir.
So this is the Daddy,
the 'ard case.
Carlin, is it?
-- Is it?
-- Yes, sir.
Don't look much to me, Carlin.
You're the little toerag who
thumped the officer at Roly.
Fancy yourself, do you, Carlin?
-- Thumpin' officers, eh?
-- I...
Speak when I tell you, lad.
They sent you here
to be sorted out.
You have heard of us, eh?
-- Heard of us, have you?
-- Yes, sir.
-- And what did you hear?
-- Nothing, sir.
I'll tell you, lad, "nothing"
was not the correct information.
Because we're having your
hooligan guts for garters.
-- Right?
-- Yes, sir.
Pick it up!
I said, pick it up!
Name and number.
4737, Carlin, sir.
Get him out of here.
Out, Carlin. Move it!
Go on, over there.
You. In.
Stand up straight, boy!
-- Name and number.
-- Bastards.
Bastards, bastards.
Pick those feet up!
Up!
In.
In line, Davis.
Attenshun!
Right, up those stairs.
Move!
Right. I'm Mr Sands,
this is Mr Greaves.
I'm the senior officer
and I run A Wing.
I run it. Right, Carlin?
Yes, sir.
I come down very heavy on anyone
who doesn't grasp that fact.
Right? Right?!
Yes, sir.
Angel, you're in a single room.
Some of the lads are
what you might call prejudiced.
Keep yourself to yourself.
Your first borstal, innit?
Yes, sir,
apart from the Scrubs...
Forget the Scrubs!
The holiday's over.
Move!
Davis, you ran away
from an open borstal.
You'll soon wish
you were back there.
You're in a single room.
Move!
Move it!
Carlin, you're in a dormitory.
Now, move!
That's it, in there,
on the left.
That's yours, Carlin.
You know the ropes. I'll jump on
you if you so much as breathe.
-- Got that?
-- Yes, sir.
There's a lad, big lad,
called Pongo in that bed.
He heard you were coming.
Now, get to work on this floor.
I wanna shave in it.
Carlin?
We don't leave our bed space
in that condition here.
Make your bed and put
your gear away. On the double!
Next time you're on report.
Pick those feet up
and keep quiet!
Banks?
Look to your front, Banks.
Carlin's been allocated
to your wing.
-- You hear that?
-- Shut it, Richards!
Three of 'em. You'll have
more company, won't you?
Sir.
-- One's a jungle bunny.
-- Yes, sir.
Quiet, Richards. Another sound
and you're on report.
Yes, sir.
You off your fucking nut?
Possibly.
I'm a vegetarian, Carlin,
and I've read the rule book.
I refuse to wear leather,
get extra potatoes
as substitute for meat,
and fish when on the menu.
Yeah, but they give you stick.
Yeah, but it causes
a lot of bother.
How long you been here?
A month. Transferred from Dover.
-- Oh, nuisance.
-- No.
Just told 'em I was Christ.
Some bastard had the flash
of genius and banged me here.
A, the Governor's religious,
B, they'll knock shit out of me.
-- How long you done altogether?
-- 16 months.
Jesus Christ, you must love it!
They're not havin' me,
the bastards.
I don't eat shit for anyone,
and I don't give a monkey's.
I'll walk out on crutches,
but they won't have me.
Davis, up.
Davis, you're nothing.
I'm the Daddy, I run this wing.
You pay your dues like the rest.
Payday, you deliver quarter
of your snout to Stripey here,
every week on the dot.
-- I don't smoke...
-- You fuckin' do now, slag.
There's no dolly mixtures
here, poofter.
I'm the Daddy, and don't
you ever forget it, right?
I said right?
Pongo Banks, the Daddy.
-- Yeah?
-- Yeah, Carlin.
Your reputation
was ahead of you.
You're gonna have
bother with that young man.
When I came from Dover
that lot thought I was a nut.
Violent, psycho, you know?
So I give 'em this wild stare
and they give me no bother.
Yes, I think
that'll do for today.
Don't do yourself
no favours, mate.
Carlin, I just wanna
get through my time my own way,
causing as much fucking trouble
to the screws as possible
in my own little way, OK?
Oi. You watch yourself
with those pigs.
-- Woods!
-- What?
Over here and keep my seat warm.
Stand up, coon. Name and number.
Attention when I come in. Up!
He said up, didn't he?!
What's this, then?!
On your feet, lad!
Name and number?!
-- Angel, sir.
-- Number?
Can't remember, sir.
Can't remember? Your number,
lad, that's all you are!
A number. Four digits.
That's all you are! 4736!
Name and number?
4736, Angel, sir.
-- Who did this?
-- What, sir?
-- Who did this?
-- Nobody, sir.
-- No, sir.
Damaging government property,
you black bastard?
No, sir.
-- What, then? You Brixton slag.
-- Nothing, sir.
Booked for fighting.
Governor's report!
-- I wasn't...
-- Right?!
Hands by your side!
Name and number?
4736, Angel, sir.
-- Louder.
-- 4736, Angel, sir.
Straight out
the banana trees, eh?
Take it from me, nig--nog,
steal white man's motor cars and
you give white man stick, right?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Now, get this cell scrubbed.
On the double!
I'm older than
most trainees here.
Yes.
The books in the library
are either trash Westerns
or hack adventure stories,
and I can't read that muck.
Roy Rogers
or Nanook of the North?
My needs are...different.
The library caters for all
trainees here, not individuals.
Besides censoring our mail
you also veto books sent?
I do.
Why haven't I been allowed
the two Dostoyevsky novels?
They're safe. You'll have
them when you're released.
-- I shan't need them then.
-- Matron.
Have you read them?
They are classics.
Archer, read them or not, Crime
and Punishment and The Idiot
are hardly suitable for a young
boy in this establishment.
-- Boy?
-- Trainee.
Your feet are disgusting,
Archer.
You're impudent and foolish.
Vegetarians don't eat meat,
but that doesn't
stop them wearing shoes.
Can't be very sincere people,
then, can they, Matron?
It's gonna be resolved
soon, anyway.
The feet and the diet.
Yeah, I'm thinking
of becoming a Sikh.
The Governor might have
something to say about that.
Matron? Do you know what I used
to do with my girlfriend?
Are you being insolent, Archer?
Hold hands.
We used to hold hands.
Er, yes, I think so.
Yes. I keep getting
through the days somehow.
You know, Matron,
when I was in the block,
seven days solitary
down there. Madam.
After much insistence,
they gave me,
besides the bolting,
my right to a book.
It was the Bible.
You'll come
to no harm with that.
It was printed in Yugoslavian,
and there wasn't
an interpreter in the cell.
Well, that only goes to show
that Christianity is universal.
Make the report, Matron.
Right, Carlin.
I run this fucking gaff.
You're dead if you come it.
Leave off. I don't give
a fuck who the Daddy is.
Piss off and let me get on
with me time, all right?
We'll give you time,
you bastard.
Slasher?
'Ere, look at this.
It's had a nightmare.
There's more where that
come from, Carlin.
You just keep
your fucking mouth closed.
You ain't no Daddy here.
Carlin!
Yes, sir?
What happened?
-- Fell, sir.
-- Where? Quiet!
Speak when I tell you!
Somebody hit you, eh?
-- Answer! Somebody hit you.
-- No, sir.
We know about you.
Who was it?
Fell, sir. Wasn't used
to the steps. Me own fault.
I want none
of your tricks here.
-- Understand?
-- Yes, sir.
Any more and you're in trouble.
-- Understand?
-- Yes, sir.
Move, you little guttersnipe!
You're on
Governor's report!
-- 4568, Jackson, sir.
-- Late, Jackson?
No, one surplus in the kitchen.
Then get over there
and get shovelling.
Oh, all over my hair!
Quiet, Jackson. Or do we want
Mr Teasy--Weasy with you?
I only washed it
last night, sir.
You little poof.
Keep shovelling.
-- Sir?
-- Can I go to the toilet?
-- No. Keep shovelling.
-- Sir, I'm bursting.
-- Keep shovelling.
-- Woods?!
-- Yes, sir?
What are you doing?
What, sir?
Oh, shovelling, sir.
Then shovel it
in the barrow. Savvy?
When we want it the other side
of the Channel we'll say, right?
Yes, sir.
Keep it moving, it's not
sand castles on Margate beach.
Come on, Archer. No slacking
from you, you cabbage.
Sometimes I somehow get
the strangest notion
they're trying
to break my spirit.
You're asking for it, mate.
Get some boots on your feet.
What d'you want?
Brought you my radio.
Borrow it till you get one.
-- No, thanks.
-- Up to you, mate.
Three of us got one. We ain't
gonna miss this one, are we?
Let us have it back later
if you don't want it.
"..Anyway, your dad will decide
and find homes for them.
"You'll still have Bessie,
but we can't keep the pups
"since we don't know
when you'll be home.
"Hope this finds you
as it leaves us.
"Let us know how you are,
and be good.
"Have to dash to catch the post.
Love, Mum and Dad."
They can't get rid of the pups.
They'll hang on till
I can take care of 'em.
I'll get a job,
then I can buy their grub.
Will you write me
a letter back tonight, Ben?
We'll see.
Read it again, eh, Ben?
Just the once?
-- Don't you go to classes?
-- Yeah.
Haven't they taught
you to read?
I can't understand
what they mean, you know,
and I don't like asking.
Just once more. I'll give
you some sweets on payday.
Go on, Ben. Please.
-- "Dear Donald..."
-- Ben?
-- What?
-- You forgot the address.
"3 Almeida Street,
Islington, London N1."
All right?
"Dear Donald..."
On your feet, lad.
4738, Davis, sir.
Whose radio is this, Davis?
-- Eckersley's, sir.
-- What's it doing here?
-- He lent me it.
-- You've nicked it.
-- No, sir...
-- You nicked it, don't bullshit.
He brought it, sir.
Eckersley has reported his radio
missing, and here it is.
You're on Governor's report.
Twat.
Tell the Governor
he lent it to you.
You'll get time on the block.
So don't antagonise the bastard.
-- It's not fair, though.
-- You listening, Archer?
-- Yeah. I dunno what it means.
-- Bleedin' fair?
-- You do time in the block?
-- No.
Well, you're gonna get it here.
So keep your mouth shut.
Cause trouble,
and they'll bolt you,
and you won't stand a lot
of their bastard handouts.
Watch Tasty Reg there.
He's a winner.
Fully--fledged humanitarian
with a BA in Hatred.
Morning, Mr White.
Morning, Mr Whittle.
-- Everything looks fine.
-- Thank you, sir.
-- Fine, Mr White. Excellent.
-- Thank you, sir.
-- Morning, Reg.
-- Morning, sir.
-- Name and number.
-- 4321, Pertier, sir.
-- All right, Pertier?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Name and number.
-- 3936, Kabiers, sir.
-- All right, Kabiers?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Name and number.
-- 4511, Chambers, sir.
-- All right, Chambers?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Name and number.
-- 4527, Smith, sir.
-- All right, Smith?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Name and number.
-- 4396, James, sir.
-- All right, James?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Morning, sir.
-- Morning.
Apart from absconding,
your record was clean, Davis,
and I have taken that
into consideration.
However, if I deal
with you leniently here
it will not be light
should you appear again.
C of E, are we?
-- Answer the Governor.
-- Pardon, sir?
-- Church of England?
-- Yes, sir.
Good. Three days in the block.
Loss of privileges for one week.
About turn, quick march. Out!
You. In.
Feet on the mat, legs apart,
face the Governor.
-- Name and number.
-- 4737, Carlin, sir.
Fighting, Carlin.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Now then, Carlin,
you were transferred to me
because you assaulted
an officer.
Heaven knows what they
expect me to do with you.
However, I will have
no violence in this institution.
There is no violence here.
-- Do you understand me?
-- Yes, sir.
Yet no sooner are you settled
then the marks are visible.
I'm a generous man, but I will
not let trainees take liberties.
If you are here again
you will be in serious trouble.
-- Do you understand?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Have you anything to say?
-- Not really, sir.
Except I wasn't
fighting, I fell.
I understand the officer thought
I had by the state of my face.
I mean,
what else could he think?
-- C of E, are we?
-- Yes, it's a great comfort.
Good. It may even have some
guidance for your reform.
Three days solitary.
Loss of earnings for two weeks.
-- About turn! Out!
-- Move it, Carlin, move it!
-- Pick your feet up!
-- Move it, double! Double!
-- Meakin?
-- Sir?
Visitor.
None of the lads'll
wear it, Banks.
They gonna walk about
with pound notes?
Pound notes
aren't allowed, Dougan.
There's stiff penalties
for anything but small change.
And very stiff penalties for
anybody undercutting my rate.
You make sure certain parties
know that, Dougan.
Right, come on, Dougan.
Now then, that's eight quid
altogether, right?
I get 70 pence for a quid
from the screw, right?
Your cut's five pence
and mine's 15.
That leaves 50 pence.
50 pence for a quid.
I got fuckin' overheads,
haven't I?
Haven't those bastards
heard of inflation?
Give 'em 50, they don't
like it they can see me.
Screw.
I'm granting your request
to marry, Betts.
I hope this induces you to
work hard and leave here soon.
It all depends on you.
One month hence, released
for four hours under escort,
to marry.
-- Right, Betts?
-- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
This causes no little
inconvenience, Betts.
It costs the taxpayer,
and I'm not pleased
you're marrying
in a registry office.
We're gonna have a proper
church do when I get out.
Hmm, let's hope you're released
before the child is born.
Yes, sir.
See you don't misplace
my trust, Betts.
-- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
-- Right, out you go.
About turn, quick march.
Move it, Betts.
Registry office.
Archer? In.
Name and number.
4721, Archer, sir.
Ahh, Archer.
Still vegetarian, are we?
-- Yes, sir.
-- And still barefoot?
Yes, sir.
Well, we have every respect for
others' sincere beliefs here.
And at a little expense we have
procured plastic boots for you.
-- Do you appreciate that?
-- Yes, sir.
No objection to plastic?
-- No, sir.
-- Good.
I hope the co--operation
will be reciprocated. Indeed.
Have you read The Life
of St. Francis of Assisi?
No, sir. Though I'm sure
it's a most engrossing epistle.
It is.
The son of a wealthy man,
he converted to Christianity,
to commit himself
to the life of the Gospel.
You should read it.
I wanted to mention access
to literature to you, sir.
You see, I'm finding myself...
strongly drawn to Mecca, sir.
Very strongly indeed.
Mecca, Archer?!
Yes, sir. It's...something
stirring within me, sir.
I'm sure you understand
what I mean, sir?
Archer, you will see
the chaplain tomorrow.
I'm an atheist, sir. It's on my
record. Atheist and vegetarian.
You told them
you were Christ at Dover.
There will be
no more talk of Mecca!
Get him issued with the boots.
About turn, quick march.
Move it, Archer.
Feet up, lad!
Come on! Move, move!
Come on, you bastards, move!
Face the front, Angel!
Get in line, Davis.
Come on, pick those feet up!
Enjoy our little holiday? Good.
Whenever you feel like a break
it's always there,
at your disposal.
-- Right, Carlin?
-- Yes, sir!
Gear in your rooms
and straight to ablutions.
I want work out of you toerags.
Now, move!
Pick those feet up! Double up!
Out!
Right, what shall we talk about?
Any problems?
Come along,
that's what I'm here for.
Why am I so far from home,
Matron?
-- 'Cause you murdered that kid.
-- All right, Eckersley.
Formby, I'm forever
explaining this. Let it sink in.
He's 14 years old. 14.
Quiet, Archer.
I never get a visitor.
That is unfortunate, Formby,
but you have to be detained
during Her Majesty's pleasure.
As there are no special places
for boys like yourself,
you have to remain here.
Here you have the opportunity
to learn and to improve.
If you behave and apply yourself
willingly and to the rules
there may be every chance
that Her Majesty,
or one of her representatives,
may consider your release
much earlier than you imagine.
Much earlier than what, Matron?
Meanwhile, try to remember
that you are more fortunate
than boys similar to yourself,
who are held at Wormwood Scrubs
until they're old enough
to transfer to prison.
All right?
My dog had three puppies.
Three. It's in my letter.
Yes, I read it, Woods.
That is good news, isn't it?
-- Where are you going, Meakin?
-- Out.
-- Out, what?
-- Out, Matron.
Sit down, please, Meakin.
-- Everything all right, Toyne?
-- Yeah, fine, Matron.
Good. Good.
Anything else?
Trust.
Pardon, Archer?
I'd like to suggest a discussion
on the nature of trust.
Are you sure that's not
a matter for your House Master?
But you see, Matron,
we are continually bombarded
with instructions to trust.
Yet at the same time
we are continuously informed
that we are completely
untrustworthy.
So perhaps it might
be of some benefit
if we were to openly
discuss the nature of trust
and explore areas where
such a valuable commodity
may be nurtured,
and not stifled or eroded.
Does anyone want to continue the
discussion suggested by Archer?
-- Matron?
-- Yes, Meakin?
Is there a chance of you calling
us by our Christian names?
I mean, it's the only reminder
of our identities we have left.
My own feelings on that subject
don't enter into it.
I'm bound by Home Office rules,
as you are.
So whatever I may personally
feel, that is the rule,
and we're all here
to learn to obey.
So, thank you all for coming.
Next week, same time.
And if you have any problems,
don't hesitate to come to me.
If I can't help,
I know Mr Goodyear will.
Carry on.
Ah! Leave it out, Stripey!
-- You're in my bleedin' way!
-- Oi!
It's all right, Ben.
What's up with you, weirdo?
You want stripin'?
You might get left alone here,
but I'll cut you to ribbons
if I get any of your poxy lip.
Back, grass!
I said, get back, shithead.
Well, carry on.
Right, Banks, you bastard!
I'm the Daddy now! Next time,
I'll fucking kill you!
Who was it, Richards?
-- Carlin? The coon?
-- I slipped, sir.
I'll give you fucking slipped.
Right, on your feet!
Who did this?!
Come on! Who did it?!
-- Where's Banks?
-- Don't know...
Dozy bastard, Banks. You let
him do you over, you twat!
I slipped, sir.
Who d'you think
you're talking to?
Carlin! I want you
to name Carlin!
I slipped, sir.
Carlin! Carlin!
Sir?
OK, Carlin. You're really
for it this time.
Banks and Richards
have named you.
You'll get three years
for this, scum.
What, sir?
You fuckin' well know, toerag.
I run this wing.
I'm not having it disrupted by
a backstreet villain like you.
You'll sign a statement
downstairs.
I'd like to see
the House Master.
You will, Carlin, you will.
And the Governor, sir.
I've got a witness.
Shit, witness.
I'm havin' you, lad.
You banged that officer at Roly.
You thought you walked
quietly away from that.
But he's here. He's me.
He's every fucking screw in
this borstal. Every one of us.
Come on. Fancy taking a poke
at me? Come on, big man.
I retaliated. Two of 'em
was kicking shit out of me.
Well, retaliate here.
Come on!
I'll have you.
Where's Carlin?
-- Carlin?
-- What?
Baldy, the Daddy from D Wing.
-- He wants to meet.
-- I don't talk.
He wants to meet.
We know what for.
He's a hard nut.
When's it gonna be?
I'll find him.
You tell him, Dougan,
he's a black bastard, right?
He knows.
Rather warm, don't you think?
Yeah. Won't be
in this sweatbox much longer.
It's all right for coons,
but it's no good to me.
All this for nicking
30 bob of junk.
-- You're joking?
-- 30 bob of fucking scrap.
Me brother had some form
so they stuck it on me.
-- Jesus. One for the book.
-- What d'you do? A bank?
No, I was trying to further
a career as a timber merchant.
Clerk. My old lady was sick,
and there was all this stick
about giving her a bad time
and her wanting to see me
secure and respectable.
You know, all that shit.
I was in this office, but got
too ambitious, didn't I?
Wasn't satisfied with me
fingers in the petty cash.
Started on the cash sales.
40, 50 quid, most weeks.
Going to work in a cab.
Till some hard--faced mare
comes back and...
Here I am.
-- First offence?
-- You know my mouth.
Gave the judge a bit of lip,
she packs me off to borstal.
40 pence a quid, that's it.
I can't, Carlin,
they'll cut my throat.
That's the way
things are now, mate.
40p. That or nothing.
The whole bleedin' nick'll
be onto you. Right behind Baldy.
Fuck 'em. If Banks paid 50
I've gotta give less.
Psychology. If I wanna keep hold
I've gotta be harder than him,
or you'll have
someone paying 60.
40's way under. It won't be
worth the risk getting money in.
OK, 45. They get 45.
But I want it made clear,
Dougan, it's a favour.
-- You had to beg me.
-- OK.
-- You had to plead!
-- Right.
-- Carlin!
-- Sir?
-- Mr Goodyear's office.
-- Yes, sir.
Dougan, Association.
-- Yes, sir.
-- I don't want you in here.
It's one of the most rewarding
aspects of this job,
encouraging ability
and individuality.
And a consequence of this
is that natural leaders emerge.
As they have throughout history.
But, Carlin,
as I am sure you are aware,
the gift of leadership
entails responsibilities,
like setting a good example
and keeping order.
Leadership means order.
Do you understand that?
-- Yes, sir.
-- Good.
Now then, you came here
with a bad reputation,
but I am prepared
to take you as I find you.
You'll have every chance to
prove yourself on this wing,
and even to win back
some of the time you've lost
through your more
unfortunate escapades.
As House Master I run this wing.
I want that firmly understood.
Nobody rocks my boat.
Do we understand each other?
Yes, sir.
-- Very well, then.
-- Just one thing, sir.
Yes?
I would like a single cell.
I think we can arrange that,
Mr Greaves?
-- Yes, sir!
-- Anything else?
-- No, sir.
-- About turn! Move!
In you go, Woods.
Carlin?
All right, Carlin.
But don't push it.
If there's any bother,
we'll have your bleedin' guts.
Right?
I said, right?
Yes, sir.
On your way.
..three, she had, three puppies.
Mum doesn't think
she can afford them,
and if they can't wait
for me to get out...
I was wondering if you'd like
one, sir. It wouldn't cost.
-- Woods.
-- Yes, sir?
You were not brought here
to discuss your dog.
-- No, sir, but...
-- Quiet, Woods!
I've brought you here to inform
you you aren't up to scratch.
Your room is dirty.
Your clothing dishevelled.
The reports from
your classes are appalling.
The list grows,
and I am warning you,
unless there is a marked
improvement in the near future
you will be in serious trouble.
I do my best, sir.
It's not good enough, Woods.
I always seem to be behind, sir.
Then do as you're told, lad!
You don't have to think for
yourself here, it's all laid on.
Forget all this juvenile puppy
business and get down to it.
I don't want
to see you again, right?
Sir.
No, no, come on.
This isn't racial. It's a game.
Right! A Wing this end,
B Wing that end. Move!
Rules.
No punching in the face.
No kicking in the goolies.
And no biting.
-- Give me that back, bastard!
-- Get it down here!
-- Out my way, black bastard!
-- Hit him in the bollocks!
Push the poof, you cunt!
Come on, get the ball moving!
-- Come on, boys, get 'em!
-- Eckersley!
-- Don't just stand about!
-- Move the fucking ball!
-- Get hold of 'em!
-- Kill the bastards!
-- Stick the boot in!
-- Move!
Kill him!
-- Fucking black bastard!
-- Push it up there!
-- I told you!
-- Fuckin' jungle bunnies!
-- Fuck off!
-- Get back! Get back!
-- Black...
-- Bastard!
Hello, Toyne. What is it?
-- Come on, what is it?
-- This. It came today.
-- I know.
-- Will you read it?
-- I have already.
-- Read it again.
"Dear Ronald,
sorry we have not wrote
"but things have been busy.
"Anyway, Candy died last week
and we buried her.
"She looked very peaceful and
we thought you should know this.
"Have to dash, good luck.
George and Bet."
Well, Toyne, somebody's pet?
Dog? Budgie?
My wife.
Candy was my nickname
for my wife.
-- No strings?
-- Get it down you, sharpish.
Vegetarians, I've shit 'em.
Carlin? That old Baldy says
the boilerhouse, tomorrow.
There'll be a whole crowd
of us there shovellin'.
He says just you and him,
all right?
Come on, Davis. Move it!
This fuckin' tool!
D'you want some more?
Leave it out, man.
Now, I'm gonna tell you once.
Just once.
-- You listenin' to me, coon?
-- Yeah.
-- You run B Wing.
-- Right.
All right. But for me.
I give the orders.
-- Right?
-- Ahh! Yeah.
You'll get your perks,
but I'm the Daddy. Right?
Yeah. Uhh...uhh.
You get some coal dust rubbed on
those marks, you black bastard.
All right, get on with it.
We haven't got all day.
Right, lads.
[All sing Here Comes the Bride]
Get the bride. Get the bride!
..you like it if someone touched
your wife up? All right.
I now pronounce you man and
wife. You can shag the bride.
I'm not marrying
a fucking coon, anyway.
-- All right! All right!
-- That's enough!
Let's have some order!
Get back into Association.
Betts, up to your room
and get changed.
Move it!
Come on, lad!
What a weddin' night. They
can even fuck that up in here.
Come on, Toyne,
you're allowed some fun.
No good standing there
moping, lad.
-- Archer.
-- Sir?
Thanks, Mr Duke.
-- It won't happen again.
-- Oh, that's lovely.
And yours?
You might
be a smartarse, Archer,
but you're a fool to yourself.
I get by.
You'll do the full stretch,
d'you know that?
Well, they're not
having me, Mr Duke.
I gotta save myself,
despite whatever methods
you bastards devise
to destroy me.
I'll get through. Or...I won't.
But it's my way.
Less lip, Archer.
I won't have insolence.
Talk's one thing, but I will
not tolerate insolence.
-- Right, lad?
-- Right, sir.
Look at you sitting there
with that daft smile.
Why aren't you
with the rest of them?
I'm an atheist.
What d'you think
that lot are, disciples?
Every Sunday there's an officer
allocated to watch you.
Because you're too pig--headed to
sit in chapel for half an hour.
And every Sunday that's
that little bit more you owe us.
You know what the boss is like.
You're committing
a mortal sin sitting here.
They're all atheists,
but they don't put it about.
I did hear you were thinking
of turning Indian.
I think about
all sorts of things.
Haven't you seen
enough of them in here?
Keep your nose clean
and get out.
Boredom. Nah, never
was much good at that.
Pass the time quietly.
You don't hear me moaning, eh?
I smile. I smile a lot.
You're loose in the head, lad.
You know when
I was in the Scrubs?
Sweating it out
I had this matchbox,
and it said,
"It takes 60 muscles to frown,
but only 13 to smile,
"so why waste energy?"
You see, I'm doing
me time in a matchbox.
Jesus Christ.
Do nothing in here,
do you, eh? Nothing.
When I was out
I reminded myself,
you can take something good
from every experience.
All I'll take
from borstal is evil.
Because you don't
bloody toe the line.
No, it's not that, Mr Duke.
You take Mr Goodyear.
He rattles out bullshit
about character building
morning, noon, and night.
That's impossible, it's not on.
How can you build character in
a regime based on deprivation?
It's a one--way contamination.
Good fine minds thrown in
with crazy perverted people.
What am I doing here?
Why aren't I on another wing
with somebody to talk to?
Where I could be civilised? I'm
always looking over me shoulder.
If it's not a screw it's a con.
Why didn't they send
me to an open nick?
You're too old for this lot.
They should've given
you a prison sentence.
Right. Right.
I was happier in prison.
I finish my time with a bunch
of snotty young hooligans.
Two years of this
before I retire.
-- How long you done?
-- A long time.
That's a hefty sentence.
One way or another in prisons.
Public service, Archer.
Haven't you realised
some of them like being here?
It's called institutionalised.
-- They're secure.
-- Are they that...?
In here you act,
you're punished and you're free.
Out there, you act, you're
punished by your own guilt,
and you're never free.
What little book is that from?
This one.
Certainly not
from what's on offer here.
Mr Duke, I don't wish to
underestimate your life's work,
but the punitive system
does not work.
My experience convinces me that
more criminal acts are imposed
on prisoners
than by criminals on society.
Convinces you, eh?
Fancy half of that mob charging
up and down your street?
Fancy your mother tackling
that lot on the rampage?
No, you bloody well don't.
So what do you do about it?
Talk about it, like we are.
Talk's bullshit.
You lock them up.
I'd also consider
what happens to their guardians.
-- Watch it, lad.
-- I'm serious, Mr Duke.
Take yourself.
For a weekly wage you have
been locking up men and boys
most of your
working life, right?
Hanging down your leg
is your key chain,
and the length of that chain
indicates the time
you have spent in the service.
You may not have been fortunate
in terms of promotion,
but the length
of that chain gives you rank
over other officers
of similar rank only.
It's a constant reminder that,
having spent your life
in the Prison Service,
you are still a basic officer.
Now, who gets
the stick for that?
Us.
Who pays for that
daily humiliation?
Stand up, Archer.
Wipe that fucking grin off
your face before I knock it off.
Name and number.
4721, Archer, sir.
I give you my fucking coffee
and you think
you can have the piss out of me?
No, sir. I didn't.
And it's as well you don't, lad.
I was concerned with
being stripped of dignity.
Cons and screws. We aren't
much different in here.
You're on report for insolence.
Yes, sir.
Stand up straight.
Right. In.
You seen her, then?
Jesus, beautiful.
I managed to touch her,
you know.
These visits are gonna
drive me fucking crazy.
Come on, you lot! Look at
this floor! Get it cleaned!
Move yourselves!
Come on, move!
That includes you, Toyne.
Mr Sands! Sands! Sands!
Move your fucking self!
Mr Jones!
You black bastard!
Archer!
Sir?
Report to my office!
Yes, sir!
Though the reports
are minor individually,
they do mean that altogether
you are not pulling your weight.
Three days. Lose one month.
About turn. Out.
Archer. In.
Feet on the mat,
legs apart, face the Governor.
-- Name and number.
-- 4721, Archer, sir.
Ahh, Archer.
Insolence, graffiti. Guilty?
Misplaced trust, sir.
How's Mecca these days, Archer?
No further information
as yet, sir.
Although I am meditating,
whenever possible.
I see. Have you read
I don't believe I've had
that literary pleasure, sir.
You should, you should.
Seven days in the block.
Lose one month.
For your meditation, Archer.
About turn. Out.
Move it, Archer. Move!
Come on, Archer!
Move it! Move, Archer!
Come on, Archer! Double, double!
I said double!
You thought the fish was bad?
Yes, sir.
-- What about the others?
-- Yes, sir.
I can answer this. I do
remember the day in question.
First of all,
that fish was not bad.
I do admit it may
have seemed strong.
Strong, yes, but not bad.
What do you mean,
"strong", Mr White?
This new Atlantic fish
they're bringing out, sir.
Its strange taste
can seem strong.
Ah, well, you know...
You should complain
at the time if something is off.
I did, sir.
-- And?
-- Mr White ate it.
Wasn't bad, then, was it?
D'you think I'd poison meself?
That was my dinner.
Well, we'll keep an eye out
for Atlantic fish.
Anything else?
The batter's all soft, sir.
It always is.
The whole wing moans about it.
Mr White?
Of course. It's impossible
to make crispy batter.
In all my years I've never been
able to make crispy batter.
The only way is to buy powdered
stuff and we can't afford that.
Come in!
Tea, sir?
-- Tea, Mr Goodyear?
-- Why not, why not?
Can we smoke, sir?
One quick burn.
Permission of Mr Goodyear.
-- What's that?
-- Nothing, sir.
-- Out.
-- Yes, sir.
I think that's covered
both wings, Mr White.
Unless there's anything else,
and Meakin is satisfied
with the batter explanation?
Meakin?
Meakin!
Answer Mr Goodyear, lad.
Stand up.
Toyne's dead!
He's killed himself
in the Scrubs. He's dead!
He cut his wrists
and you send him to the Scrubs,
to kill hisself! He's dead!
Up your fucking borstal!
I realise
there's bad feeling about Toyne.
We're deeply sorry, but these
things happen, as you know.
Many boys arrive
in disturbed conditions
and there isn't the staff
to cope with them.
I don't want the boys on
this wing behaving erratically.
It'll do no good.
In fact, they only make things
difficult for themselves.
I want you to use your influence
to keep things...down.
If you see what I mean.
It'll soon blow over.
-- All right, Carlin?
-- Yes, sir.
Good. Now, off you go.
-- In.
-- Out!
3318, Meakin, sir.
-- In.
-- Out!
3610, Woods, sir.
-- In.
-- Out!
4721, Archer, sir.
-- In.
-- Sir?
-- 4736, Angel, sir.
-- What is it, Archer?
No exercise today, sir. Request
to see the Governor, sir.
In.
Archer, exercise
is dependent on the weather.
-- It looked like rain.
-- But it didn't, sir.
Dirty cell, Archer.
Governor's report.
Imagine that
in the back of a Mercedes.
Looks like a bird I knocked off.
Great bristols.
Do anything, she would.
Anything.
I've had that, but thin.
Thin birds go potty for me.
Christ, when I get out --
the big time, big stuff!
I've got ideas. You never come
out of nick short on ideas.
And you know
where you went wrong.
You can learn a lot in here.
Banks are best, one big job
and you're set for life.
Planning, that's all it needs,
and bottle.
-- In, bang, out.
-- No shortage of birds then.
I never have been short,
plenty of crumpet after me.
-- Listen to Burt Reynolds.
-- Watch your mouth.
Only crumpet you've had
is your fist.
You'll get my fist.
Leave off, we're sick
of hearing you two.
Hey, hey, hark
at our bent friend.
You two fancy yourselves?
Piss off. You couldn't organise
a piss--up in a brewery.
-- I'll have you.
-- Cut it out.
You got some front, ain't ya?
We saw you when Carlin
sorted you out.
You and Pongo. Any more
bother and you'll get it again.
And Eckersley,
and you know that, shithead.
Anyone comes near me
gets striped.
No matter who they are.
Just remember, shitbag,
people get moved around.
Carlin ain't gonna be here
changin' your nappies forever.
He'll be out in a month,
and I'm gonna carve you two
bastards up first chance I get.
Just remember that,
the pair of you.
Can we have a quick burn, sir?
OK, but don't take
too long about it.
What d'you want?
Ah! Ow!
Turn him over.
Please! No! No! No--o!
Please, no!
-- Ahh.
-- No--o--o!
Come on,
you lot! Let's have you!
Right, let's have you!
Come on outside,
you lazy bastards!
Davis, what are you doing there?
-- Well, lad?
-- Nothing, sir. I fell, sir.
Back on to your feet.
This isn't Kew Gardens, laddie.
On your feet.
I was in the laundry today.
All bleedin' day.
Murder.
I hate it in there.
Not bad tomorrow, though.
On the gardening detail.
I like that.
Get some air, like a holiday.
Almost imagine
you're not in this hole.
You're on gardening tomorrow.
Your name's on the list.
See you, then.
All right, Davis, what is it?
Speak up.
Why d'you ring?
Don't you know it's an offence?
I feel lonely, sir. Frightened,
sir. I daren't close me eyes.
I feel bad, depressed.
I don't know what to do.
Cut that out, Davis,
or I'll give you something
to cry about, you little toerag.
You touch that bell again
I'll have you down the block.
Now, get your
subnormal head down.
Move!
Ah!
Ah!
Wakey wakey!
-- 6.30, come on, get up!
-- Rise and shine!
-- Wakey wakey, come on!
-- Rise and shine!
Come on, up you get!
Come on, move!
Right, up to attention!
Davis, you lazy twat! Out!
Right, Davis, Governor's report.
Right, Mr Duke!
Put 'em in their rooms!
Move yourselves!
That includes you, Archer!
-- Come on.
-- Move yourselves! Move!
And you, Carlin!
Move!
Eat!
Eat, or it goes in the bins!
Eat!
Carlin! Eat!
Dead, Dead, Dead...!
Dead! Dead! Dead!
Eat, Carlin!
Cunts!
Fucking bastards!
Dead!
Dead! Dead! Dead!
Come on, Archer!
First, the damage
must be paid for.
Loss of earnings until every
damaged article is paid for.
And to encourage you to work
hard and make good this debt
with all expediency,
there are no privileges.
None. You have to earn them.
Now, with regard to our absent
friend, I would remind you all
that sad and unfortunate
accidents occur
in institutions like this
just as they do outside.
We are all accident--prone,
even here.
It is most regrettable,
but I will tolerate
no further outbursts
like the one recently witnessed.
I will not tolerate it.
There will now be
one minute's silent prayer
for our departed friend.
