I do not know yet, Mr. Cooper, what's 
happening further depends on Israel.
For Israel?
What does Israel in all this?
Did you make people like to believe 
that people are free and you go home ...
	What kind of animal are you?
I do not want to kill you, Mr. Cooper.
I want to be civilized
So Board and the plane with other passengers!
Please!
Go, go!
If you negotiate with these criminals did we sell the 
right of national and tere to have the seastã þarã.
But if you get away with it, any Israeli traveling up
 its overseas, and will put life in danger.
This is an international problem.
It is an act of piracy.
Terror know's some criminals! 
No more, no least May!
Every time I try to look only at the facts in 
this meeting, someone hold a speech.
Every time I try to look only 
at the facts in this He is right.
Now, let's see what possibilities there!
Mota, you can remove the army 
from there?
Like situation is not!
Why?
Where to start?
First, there is a huge distance.
and we have no friends 
on the road.
I fear airport knowledge, no.
An Israeli company he built.
Yes, but they said that the airport 
in Ugandaa fost complet schimbat!
But if we use spies?
But if we use spies?
We need accurate information.
How soldaþi have no idea how many
 planes, how much fuel it takes to
 fly up in Uganda?
How soldaþi have no idea how many 
planes, how much fuel it must remove
 þa resistance, to ensure the airport, 
to take the 240 passengers ...
We gotta do this!
Yes!
Food and fly 2,500 miles back.
Are 240 people, and not all are Israeliteni.
That's right!
We Israelis would be killed and i.
This would have serious 
international repercussions.
But Amin?
It is their part?
I say yes.
I should be with them.
You do not have flown 2,500 miles
 to climate.
It is our policy not to negotiate with 
Terror never know unless we have 
no alternative
Uganda is just a part of the problem.
If you do not make a decisive move 
that in this crisis, it would be a suicide
politics.
This is not a problem of politics, but life 
and death.
In this second, the two issues can not be 
separated.
I have to act.
Action ... 
is very dangerous.
Nova's new people will die!
You understand each other!
You need to understand more clearly
 the situation, then we can decide how
 to act.
That takes time..
We have to make a decisive move
 that now, now!
To make a move which decided against whom? 
A ghost?
To make a decisive move which not you heard 
what he said the army?
We do not have enough data!
Our country is paralyzed by this atrocity
Yitzhak, this diversion is and how we 
would invade you.
Therefore you must retort.
and if you wrong in what we do? 
We take the hostages and they 
say 'bye! 
Haide, asta e o prostie.
We need a realistic plan.
I have to talk to the French. 
It is a French plane þuzesc.
The Israelis will kidnappers.
So Prepare.
All right!
know with all that it is our duty to
 free the hostages needles you and 
we will not sacrifice your life for other
 Israelis to do that
If the army comes to us and tells us that 
have a workable plan, if you come to us, 
we will consider
In the meantime, you need to do 
something.
By French, you should discuss bids 
counteroffer, and you'll nem Price down
By French, you should discuss 
But we will get these people back 
home and he'll bring to life
Regardless of what is needed!
Well, we could talk with Amin on
the phone ...
Look at that!
I think our policy is to not negotiate
 with Teror know.
Negotiation could be the 
only solution is you!
It is inconceivable to free criminals
 from prison.
Has not decided anything.
That the hostages will be and get 
back safely.
No more will be another Munich.
But do not we occupied Munich.
This time, we can deal in
 November.
I know, but nobody goes anywhere 
and not do anything until they are 
absolutely sure we are ready know.
We'll be ready.
Everybody stand back.
Sit down!
Sit down!
Do not move as you!
Column left to right!
The right to left!

area more comfortable

Caution!
Look out, everybody!
Sit still!
The radio in Uganda has just sent
 our demands: the release of the
 53 heroes revolutionari.
They are in the prisons of France, 
Germany, Suisse and especially in Israel.
I informed the French that if we are
 behind you until Thursday at 12, the 
plane and all passengers will remove 
you.
If Israelis are not criminals, you all, 
regardless of where coming, you will die
Thursday at 12 is the deadline.
Let's go!

People like you do not play!
I want to be with you!
Why you need this?
Sign your name and join other!

Do not go there!
Next time I kill you!
It is not the right time!
I'll be fine!
You get to watch you!
Keep going!
Do not touch me!
We'll get there, but do not touch me!
So I began to Auschwitz, last time!
First we shout the name, now we'd expect.
Nobody'd expect at this!
I did not kill anyone entire life before
 that.
What do you think will make us all?
I have no idea!
Well, the French do all the pressures
 that they can do it!
But I can not do anything extra.
Now you will not know 
if we prepare you for negotiations to 
exchange prisoners.
Switzerland's nationals, the French, Germans, 
are all ready to submit their applications.
Not much choice. 
The deadline is mâine.sã to submit their applications.
What to say French?
Tell them that yes, we will negotiate.
I need more time.
I'll be waiting until the last
moment before accepting and even 
one of their requests.
Of course, it is, and other problem.
How will people react to this?
Amin...
Do not ever had more publicity than now!
Maybe I will not want to stop.
Hello! 
Hello! 
Hello!
I hope you're right.
We are happy to announce you t
hat we arranged the release of 47 
women, children, elderly and sick.
We freed these people immediately, 
as a gesture of confidence in the negotiation!
When you go to Paris to convey this message
to your government: Tell them that the 
Palestinians will not only pieces you're a land 
that is theirs!
Palestinians do not want to kill anybody.
Palestinians want all have one thing very
 important, peace!
I'm sorry for your inconvenience.
I hope that the soul of the Palestinian 
demands would be met before the Israeli 
government to þeze for them to use explosives on you.
Now go to negotiate the issue and your safety.
I alom! 
I alom!
One more thing!
It is very important!
I have to continue to have care, 
because the Palestinians have made
 explosives, and in this place.
See you soon! 
I alom! Bye-bye!
The key element is surprise!
We go out at the terminal also know 
that Terror will not have time to react.
First, you need to get there!
We need to fly your untraceable 2500 miles 
to an airport who know very little things here 
and to land in the dark
Is not you or u!
Benny, if someone can do this, then you're
 that person!
Where our food to go home?
We think of that!
Maybe we have a friend in Africa.
Then you go there!
But I'll give you realize while the
 plane is ground þinte people are safe
I do not worry! 
I'll protect you.
Well, we May least a day just to be ready
Tomorrow is the deadline.
Please, everyone is concerned!
This situation can be resolved only
 in asingur fel!
We need to negotiate.

Yes, I think we have time!
But whatever happens, I'm in your þelege 
consequences þele Terror this victory for you!
We care about Terror you!
and I want as much as I like everyone
 to be brought safely to their families.
But when they're 40 Teror you give
criminals are at hand, not by what we have to celebrate.
It will be a day of mourning for Israel.
Thank you, my friends!
Thank you Mr Prime Minister!
I convinced the Palestinians 
to extend the deadline for negotiations
for another three days, until Sunday, July 4.
Negotiation of it's failed until now 
because of the fit þâ nÃ countries and Israel, but I keep trying.
I'm going now in the islands Mauricius at United's international and African!
I'll take the plane hostage
I know with all that I want to help!
But their situation is very dangerous 
If the Israeli government does not accept 
Palestinian demandsr.
Use office and even my good friend 
of Israel, Colonel Ba 'Alive, to help them
And even using office Sorry, Mr President's pre Amin!
And even use the office I God, do you?
I'm just a grandma, but ...
I am Excelenca Sa, El Hajij, Feldmare's release,

Tell them to accept conditions the Palestinians.
I think we should do it tonight!
It is very important!
Then do a party and you go home

on the security of their responsibility 
We are here with them, and not in Paris.

Go!
Quiet, please! 
Quiet!
You can return to the main room..
It is more comfortable. 
It's much space for everyone
Please!
That was the good doctor who Amin 
postponed the deadline until Sunday.
Mr Cooper, we deal with this Continue, not Amin
They issued us all Israelis!
Now is clear.
They are against our.
Arrogan you are!
They let the hostages go, they changed 
deadline, they feel safe in the distance.
Hostages we have provided information of great value!
and increased requests!
They added the list of names Teror you that it will release.
Plus five million U.S. dollars ransom for the plane.
and reduced the number ostaticilor 100. 
That helps us.
Palestinians threatened that they will throw 
in the air with the hostages, if it does 
any rescue attempt.
Palestinians threatened that they will throw 
Have not done this before.
However, and are a threat þa re!
Plan ready?
Not yet! 
But make progress
This extension help us
How much longer?
We're almost done! 
A few hours!
Okay, I'll get some time in May.
Keep negotiate .
Ba 'Alive to call Amin.
Do it yourself is not happy
Eventually, Mr. Pre's President, are you Commandor and þãri 
and you have the power to issue on these people
Not there a point to stay in history as a man just re you? 
and you have the power to issue on these people.
Colonel, I know you consider a friend for a long time. 
and you have the power to issue on these people.
No matter what happens, we are old friends!
I'm ready to make peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
That'll mean your government.
We appreciate everything you do for our people, 
But many Palestinians are unreasonable requests
We can help you?
If the government accepts the request Palestinians will leave.
If not, they will kill the hostages and will throw the plane into the air.
Pre's President Sir, if you want to be 
a holy man, than you, and to stay in history, 
maybe you will get Nobel Prize, 
Should release on these people
Think about it what is this unique opportunity.
To prove the whole world what great man of state you are!
Yes ...
What are you doing, buddy? 
Much I have not seen!
and the wife is with you in Tel-Aviv?
We are good!
Listen!
Do not you let influence the Palestinians!
Influence are not the Palestinians!
I take my own decisions.
I do my best to save vieþile 
Israelis, but my situation is very difficult.
And you have to You know that.
The whole world should you give it
Sir pre's President, I think you are a great soldier!
I think that stands in your power to prevent bloodshed
I think the power lies in the Palestinians have no right 
to do what I do on your territory and þãri
I say you should shooting and that the Terror you?
Well, give them protection!
Living in Uganda like the resort
It is not true.
Come to see with your eyes!
They live with the hostages.
If you act in any way, vieþile 
 ostaticilor are in danger.
If you act in any way, vieþile 
I want peace for Palestinians.
But, good friend, I can greatly help people.
Tell your government to stop practice 
 This policy sionisto-fascist
Mr President's Pre ...
Pre Doomnulee's President!
I am not saying that you ...
Greetings family ...
Members say that the government is playing with fate!
I alom! 
I alom, Ba 'alive!
You've heard what he said!
The leader of a þãri became wearer 
the word of some Terror're criminals
As far as I know, never an Army has not supplied data 
been used to help international piracy.
So our choice is u's time
But you must make a choice, and 
military option is the best.
Our plan has never been tested 
fully, but is a reasonable risk
Dan Shamron, who is responsible 
this plan, we will present it.
The plan may sound risky, but based 
Our experience in the fight Terror know.
Operations lightning has three stages.
The first implies movement 
Israeli troops in Uganda
Flying on this course at altitude extremely 
low can avoid most radar plants.
If we detect in this area, is a big 
opportunity to be as an aircraft trading.
I'll fly seven hours and last 
part will be over Lake Victoria.
Therefore, Mr. Prime Minister, in November, the hostages 
Entebbe, we ask that the Palestinian prisoners
Israeli prisons to be release soon for 
that we can return safely to Israe.
Dr. Amin has helped us.
Give up on this letter. 
Apparently colaboracionism.
Ce conteazã?
Thus, as well as the President's life will be happy!
I think it is a struggle for power between Amin and Terror you
He's making his move to. 
We are the prize.
In addition, you must do everything 
 we held it for a dialogue between us and them.
This is important!
This is a letter I take ru!
We could hold something in life more!
Sign the letter!
What about the refueling to return?
We'll take our pumps and power 
we use the fields of fuel in Ugand.
	It is dangerous. 
I have too much ground.
This wait a response from the Kenya 
on refueling.
Until that is clear, the plan is too risky.
I have to fight your troops to Uganda 
if tries to stop
Do not go to Entebbe to fight with 
 Uganda, but to save vieþi the Israelis.
Those that Uganda will try to us 
 will be stopped neutralize you.
The plane will be tactical C130.
Mane they are bird health and scope of action 
for such Continue.
In addition up to C130, we will use two Boeing 707
One of them will be ready for medical services, 
and you communicate to the other.
Tell them that we're dealing with communications and 
in the 707-which will remain in the air during the work you do.
Before concluding, need to talk something!
Ali's confidential health!
Probably operations will take place and depart
If any activity takes place we ordinarily Friday's nuit 
evening or Saturday and that is how we send

That's true for my wife.
Especially for me vast!
What is the next step?
I have to put things end to end.
Troops, equipment, everything!
and to do tests.
How long will it take?
Everything is ready.
Dan will do exercises tonight,

Dan, can you stay a little in May?
The information that we say 
I will begin killing hostages Sunday.
Why debate on the military plan? 
Let them go!
Because it is not perfect!
Like a joke ...
You're concerned about perfect and we do not have a choice.
You're concerned about the need to put 200 of the best 
people on that plane
Damn, I have no choice!
Wasting time! 
We gotta do something!
Wasting time!
This mission needs a goal now, 
to take shape
We're postponing until the last minute.
A country to go to the dogs with his deliberations.
Weighing every possibility!
He has the courage to let us go there?
Courage is not his problem.
But his task!
Eventually, I will circumstanþele exceed i.
Eventually, you'll need to let us go there.
I alom! 
I alom.
I think it should be clear that, while
 negotiating the release ostaticilor, 
and we think the military option.
We have a plan in preparation, but before 
to do something, I want you, as leader of 
 Opposition's her, to be agreed.
What we do not know is what you'd expected so!
I was always a better man than you!
You can act quickly enough now?
Our plan is zne's Town.
What would be the cost in your life?
It could get expensive!
Is it ever been otherwise? ...
and However, every time I went to 
table of negotiation, Israel has lost.
Then you can count on?
Of course, you Support my bad.
I alom! 
I alom!
Come on!
Well, Colonel Netanyahu!
General Shomrom will begin operations lightning!
Yes!
Good luck!
Ionny.
ÎIn this mission I think you should 
only use sharpshooters!
The most elite unit!
Yes!!
There will be special for them þe from Mahasi's era
Well!
and will be the people of the Golan brigade
Do not mix too much. 
It is better for people to get to know each other.
I'll start with a semicircle.
Semicircle?
Well!
Sammy, where are you going?
I'm going to walk!
What you mean to walk? 
For you depart?
I'm going to get some friends!

I'm going fishing for morning!
Have fun!
Samuel, to watch!
Father!
What do you mean? 
I'm going fishing!
See you do not fall!
Thanks, Ali!
I do not want to say "I told you I ...
But what did I say? 
Look who is sick ...
Look who was not sick.
Home with you not eat it, but in Uganda, do that.
Not eat meat and do not drink their milk.
I feel very good!
What happened?
Somebody, help!
Can not breathe!

It's okay. 
U's or!

Sit with her!
In the back, all over the world!
May you go back!
I told everyone to go back in May!
You remove your u so! 
Now!
People people are bad. 
They need help!
Do not you do anything?
Mr Cooper can not do anything 
until I know that all my fellowship name are free.
 And if you fra tã are not released.
Israel does not let you die you!
My country does not negotiate with criminals.
In þarã a little like yours, all 
Everyone is related to everyone!
In a little like þarã Or maybe that your government 
does not take seriously Our time limit.
Sunday, when Israel will be forþat to kill the first hostage, 
You then will I talk Serios.
The key is the ability attack first columns 
to reach the terminal, the surprise was still 
valid.
A few seconds may be the difference between 
a successful mission and bad ostaticilor massacre
Inside the terminal, regardless of the challenges, 
do not use hand grenades.
Base your  arms to your.
Pull your puffy short!
As soon as you have taken control, 
keep the fire at a minimum level.
That's all
Over an hour do you repeat a
Ionny will respond to any questions!
Sammy!
This looks very much like operations 
Rescue Savina airport in Tel-Aviv.
As I see situation, the problem is 
distinguished immediately Teror's fish up the hostages.
Right.
So we have it's identification 
 Terror for each of you.
Data from over 100 hours 
 questions put ostaticilor release from 
Paris, but it's the agency's and no's tri.
Study your attention to these figures.
I need to know by heart.
Terror you know you should be instantly recognized by ..
If you have time to return on ostaticilor, 
Our entire mission will be a disaster. Instantly .
Terror If you know you are Ona's position in 
such a way that we can not avoid fire on ostaticilor?
If we succeed, and the hostages will be as 
 caught and that's Teror know.
I have to tell them what to do.
You choose your words that you 
communicate quickly and clearly.
We want them to fall to the floor as soon as possible..
But that's giving a direct answer, the 
decision whether to issue or not, it will appear here.
Keep in mind, a single terrorist can 
Continue destroy whole.
Ionny!
Let life in a terrorist?
It would be good!
I like to have them, but our priority is hostages.
keep in mind that they're Terror you are criminals.
They try to kill the hostages, so first 
gloanþe must be accurately.
All right
Land here
It's just a model.
It could happen.
10 seconds.
Give it up!
Push jalopy that once!
Duke did it!
That's it!
How was it?
I just killed 100 hostages!
If everybody does not fall into terminal 
exactly in those and second, will be a disaster!
May we do once!
Come on your back!
What is it?
It is much better!
What do we do with MIG's this?
If one of them escape us, not 
May descend into Uganda!
If one of them we know!
Good job, Dan!
Can we be sitting on the ground an hour?
60 minutes is an excellent!
Think and that can be reduced to 55 minutes!
Based on what you see, I can tell you we are ready?
Patience!
 Let's make sure we can answer all the questions!
Ionny, How many people you think you'll lose?
Between 30 and 35

Element of surprise will not be!
We need to attack the 
terminal with more puþini people.
Are you sure Mota?
Nothing is certain, Iþhak.
How will the team take?
55 minutes.
and if something does not go well ...
Meanwhile, the stagnant negotiations. 
They refused everything we asked.
When I suggested that prisoners be 
change in Tunis, Paris and Cyprus, we have refused.
They insist that it be made in Uganda
Impossible!
It can not be like the Palestinians to control the Amin.
 Even if you know Teror would like to exchange,
