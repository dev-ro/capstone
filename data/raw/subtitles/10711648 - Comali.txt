'I am Ravi'
'Anything can happen in life'
'Things we do not
even imagine may happen'
'One such incredible story...is mine'
Sir, 'caste' and 'religion'
haven't been filled in this form
- What is 'caste', son?
- I don't know, pa
We are teaching them
something they are clueless
Let my son grow up equally with
his classmates oblivious of all this
I won't fill up those details, thanks
That's all
Job over
He loves wasting time on Sundays
claiming to make Dhokra statuettes
We should do the work we love
even if people criticize us
It will always come in handy
Why is that broken, pa?
This piece, huh?
This is handed over in our family
to the person they love
My father gave it to me
I am giving it to you now
'I was thrilled to bits'
'Then what?'
'This proved I am appa's favorite'
Thanks, pa
Keep it carefully
Ravi, let's play a game of cricket
Coming, Mani
'So I grew up in the 90s'
Azharuddin!
'Our street was our playground!'
'Whatever our activities
we were into it as a gang'
'We used to save money for a week
to buy vermicelli popsicle'
'Hey! Ice, da'
'Remember, we used to hire cycles
and bike everywhere?'
'Rs 3 for 1 hour'
'Book cricket, love letter, postman,
Sachin Tendulkar, WWF, trump cards'
'How can we forget all that excitement?'
'20 houses shared 1 TV set'
'1 telephone used by 10 houses'
1 minute
Phone for Usha
'Phone for Usha it seems'
'Even if these antics were small
our happiness was gigantic!'
[sit or stand game]
Why are you crying?
What happened?
She broke appa's shaving mirror
She's scared he will beat her up
Oh! Don't worry, dear
I'll tell appa it was a mistake
Come out for a minute
Why were you just watching her cry?
Shouldn't you be consoling her?
I know anyway appa will punish her
How can I console her?
Listen to me
If someone cries in front of us
or confides their worries
...they are not expecting us to solve it
Won't someone hold their hands and say
'I'm there for you
Don't be scared'
These are the only words
of comfort they expect
To them it isn't important
what you can or can't do
But the reassuring words
you speak at that time
'I'm there for you'
That is important
Do you understand?
Okay, go
Reassure her now
'I'm there for you, Divya
Don't be scared'
'1999'
'I can never forget this year in my life'
153...154...155-
'I was soooper happy'
'Not because I passed'
'New girls will join as freshers
every year, right?'
'Girls in our school always
tend to be so-so and lame'
'But today is new admission'
- Hi R.Vignesh
- 'New girls'
'1st day of 12th grade
with a pocketful of dreams'
Hey there!
Welcome back, showered with
Lifebuoy soap, huh?
So-so
More so-so
'Idli' vessel
Mood out
Hi, I'm Bhoominathan
Shy maybe?!
- Akash Raja
- Present, miss
'Anand Kumar'
What is this new practice
of taking attendance?
Is it the end of the 3 'R's, revelling,
rejoicing and reacting to girls?
Ravi, this section is only till
names beginning with 'M'
You are in the next section
I have a biscuit
I have a pencil
And a pencil box
with a push button
I have a scented eraser too
Do you have a biscuit?
I don't have
This half is for you
Let's be friends, always together
Okay, da
You go now, I'll cry
my heart out and join you
Somehow come to that section
- Don't feel bad
- Wangle it somehow
I'll come with you right away
Let go of me
My friend misses me already
'Looks like he won't leave'
Soap box face!
Tell him
He has gone...happy!
- My name is Nikitha
- Excuse me, miss
Father's name is Krishnamurthy
'Yes, come in'
He works in HDFS bank
My mother's name is Sathya
Housewife
And I live in Madipakkam
Madipakkam!
'Madipakkam'
How are you so sure
this is her house?
'Machan, attendance register has
all the contact details, right?'
'I flicked it'
Nikitha...here it is
- Hey! No address?
- Not filled I think
Aiyo! Note down her phone #
2258 2999
Let's go, quick
'I poured over the directory night and day
for that phone # and traced it'
'But that street confused me
with its share of old and new numbers'
'So I dialled that number'
'I confirmed it 101%'
"He is the King of Romance
Cupid's avatar in every sense"
I think that's her mother
- She is missing
- Her mother looks good though!
Er...excuse me
'I can see her father now'
'Hello?'
She's saying 'hello'
That's her!
'Hello'
She's saying 'hello'
That is Nikitha!
I heard a 'hello'
Her mother!
'Who is this idiot calling daily?
My broomstick will speak!'
"If you greet me with a 'hi' that will do
I get a kick from toe to brow"
- I got transferred here
- She said 'hi'
- When's your wedding?
- Wedding, huh?
"If you giggle or glare at me
my heartbeat races to a 120"
"Without any shame or shyness
I'll follow you like a pup, princess"
"My cycle is the vehicle so handy
Doodles on our school loo walls randy"
"Call her to the canteen daily
Ask her to pay my bill duly"
"When she passes by, yell out 'Ravi'
If she smiles, my love spells victory"
"I am the last bencher in class as a rule
From now on I'll show swag in school"
"I make a scene without reason
I'm the school don for every season"
"I show off for no reason whatever
I am the school's don hereafter"
My dear son
Eat 'pakoda' and study
Drink it up
Complan
Love!
Shall we get back to class?
List out 3 'semmozhi'
Classical languages
Then mozhi, Kani mozhi, Ilam mozhi
Then mozhi, Kani mozhi, Ilam mozhi
'What's funny?'
'Loony lady!
Why is she cackling?'
Mani, this is nice joke
- Thanks
- Mani
Tell her it is my joke
How can I?
Everyone is laughing
This is my joke now
Shall we get back to class?
List out 3 classical lan-
'Leave it, teacher'
Mani, that's a nice joke
Thank you
That was my joke
I cracked it!
- Don't believe Ravi
- Ravi, keep silence
- Quiet!
- 1 minute, I'll be back
Miss...miss
'Looks like it's joke of the year!'
This is why I don't joke much
Others steal my copyright!
- Principal!
- Mani
I shared your joke
with our principal
Hey Mani
It's a nice joke, man
Thank you
I appreciate, sir
Plenty more in my head
to present later
'This school is going down the drain
only because of you!'
- Thank you
- 'Super joke, Mani'
Nib broke, eh!
That was...my joke
"Just for effect I'll pile book on book
When you pass by flirtatiously I'll look"
"I'll act the goody-goody dude
Given a chance I'll brush against you"
"Like an ink bottle is your heart I know
Filled with love waiting to overflow"
"My pen waits here for ink to flow
Love is my spring for life to glow"
"Eyes like marble mesmerize me
My mind spark(le)s like roll caps zappy"
"Hearing her voice on the phone
sleepless nights I spent alone"
"I'll stand with guts to surpass
the boys from the next class"
"If any fellow tries to act funny
I'll break his teeth, watch me"
"I make a fuss for no rhyme or reason
I'm the school don for every season"
"Rain or shine I show off mighty
I'm the don in this school almighty"
- I'll profess my love today
- Okay
- I'll tell her later
- Okay
"Call her to the canteen daily
Ask her to pay my bill duly"
"When she passes by, yell out Ravi"
- I will
- Tell later
"I am the last bencher in class as a rule
From now on I'll show swag in school"
You want to tell her later, right?
"I make a scene without reason
I'm the school don for every season"
"I show off for no reason whatever
I am the school's don hereafter"
"I make a fuss for no rhyme or reason
I'm the school don for every season"
"Rain or shine I show off crystal clear
I'm the don in this school, my dear"
What is this?
I intend teaching how to
make such Dokhra statuettes
- Wow! Soooper!
- You like it?
- Take it
- No...no
I've brought my camera
Can I take a photo of all of you?
'That's his agenda!
Photo...let's pose'
'Don't stamp my foot'
'Suresh, sit down
Don't hide us'
So this 'bhajji' shop is the venue, huh?
Yes, this is the venue
Want to know why?
He comes here daily, rain or shine
irrespective of the weather forecast
Every single day without fail
Because
...he is hypnotised by
the fritter shop lady's hip
'If we must kill Gaaja, he should not
be aware of himself or his surrounding'
'Only when he looks at her waist and hip
he will be in a trance'
When she finishes frying onion fritters
and takes the raw banana to slice
...for 60 seconds she'll be
in a bent posture
She slices the onion standing straight
She slices the banana like this
So in that 1 minute
she takes to slice the banana
...he will be totally oblivious
of what is happening around him
Bro, I'm so sorry
'It was sheer accident, bro'
If she bends to slice the banana
...we have only 1 minute
to spring into action
'We must do our job
before she slices the banana'
'We enter the fritter stall'
You pick the knife she has used
Because he shouldn't have
any weapon within his reach
'The three of us go
and sit next to him'
'You pick the knife we've brought
and one swift blow'
'Fritter lady will be shell shocked'
We clear the crime scene
of our evidences
'And scoot as fast as we can'
Suppose our plan misfires?
Even then the fritter lady
will be shell shocked
Tell me why?
'Watching Gaaja kill him'
How the hell will it misfire?
No way, bro
I'll kill him
- So tomorrow?
- Yes
21st century
I'll be the new don Gaaja
Tomorrow?
Yes, machan
1999, December 31st
If I propose tomorrow, we will be
the 1st pair of lovers in 21st century
Sounds cool, right?
I've asked her to meet me
near Sona Bakery
Sona Bakery?
Kissing spree from tomorrow, huh?
- 1-4-3, eh?!
- Don't tease me!
It's a private joke
You do your job, teacher
Hey! He's waiting for you
Jolly times ahead!
He's coming
Gaaja's coming
What's your tearing hurry?
Raw banana fritters
Time to enter
Hi
Hi
Where's he-
Slice it real thin
'Come on, you tortoise'
'Next plan is to finish you off!'
Now take that knife-
I was about to say
'Stab him when she bends'
Why are you messing up like this?
Hey! Take that knife
'Bro, wait'
'That banana is reducing in size'
Take...hurry up
For me?
You said you like-
You said you like it, right?
Our family custom, we give this
to whomever we like the most
This is from me to you
Take the knife out, da
Don't waste time
- I'm telling you to give it to me
- Bro, not that!
Let go of my hand, you idiot!
Finish him
Finish him off!
I thought if any object breaks
its life ends at that point
But when I saw you and
my heart broke, I understood
Only after that a new chapter
has begun in my life!
'Grab something heavy'
Smash his head
Not oil, you moron!
Hey! Super, da
Clear the evidence at once
- Bro, how to go in this crowd?
- Pick that up
Okay, what are you
trying to tell me now?
No-
I-
I...
I love you!
I-
Oh gawd!
Romance happening here
Whatever happens,
love is blind?
Weapon!
I'll stab her with this
Don't come near me
Don't take another step
This is really sharp
I'll kill her
Go away
I'll stab her for sure
Don't hurt her
- Let go of her
- Get on to the bike
- Nikitha!
- 'Start the bike'
Go...go
'Faster...faster'
Happy New Year!
Next Gaaja of the world!
'Office calling'
Mani...?!
Yes, I'm Mani
Beard-
Hey...wait!
It's alright, machan
Wait...wait
Hear me out
Relax, don't get perturbed
Listen to me
Ma...?
Our uncle has woken up, ma
- Sister!
- Bro, listen
Wedding chain
Brother
No
Dream...it's all a dream
Listen to me for a second
You had slipped into coma until now, da
Coma...?
A lorry hit you that day, right?
'We rushed you to the hospital'
'You lost a lot of blood'
'Your brain didn't get enough blood'
'Doctors said you had slipped into coma'
'He said either in a few days
or in a few months you'll wake up'
'That doctor retired
But you never recovered'
'Because the hospital charges
hit the roof, we brought you home'
'I took such good care of you
making sure not even a fly bothered you'
Hey! How often I've told you
not to sweep the ant powder?!
If an ant bites, you'll scream
Can he do the same?
Get out!
As an IT staff
I'm telling you, out!
'Only the calendar changed every year
But there was no reaction from you'
'Even then, I took care of you like a baby'
'Bathing you, applying powder,
changing your Huggies'
- 'Huggies?'
- I couldn't clean you up
My hand hurt
As usual I was keeping an eye
on you today too
Looking at you
Reading the paper
Action replay
'But I didn't notice the tyre enter, da'
'I should've let an ant
bite you right then'
My fault!
Ho...how many days have I been like this?
2 x =
Just 16 years, da
SIXTEEN YEARS?!
Hey!
Which year are we in?
2016
2016
Not lying to me, are you?
Of course not
1 second
'We'll retrieve Cauvery from Karnataka
if we occupy the seat of power'
'We will make India
a super power within 20 years'
Hey! This is 1996
Whom are you trying to fool?
They keep repeating this every year
Take a look now
He has locked 500 and 1000 rupee notes
and has released 2000 notes
'He's our nation's...
He works selflessly for our welfare'
Who is your husband, dear?
Machan!
Who is my bro-in-law?
My dear bro-in-law!
'Looks like he will slip into coma again!'
How come, da?
I told her that joke, machan!
'Then mozhi, Kani mozhi, Ilam mozhi...!'
'This is my joke
Trust me'
'Copyright mine, only mine'
She became happy
I became her husband
- Appa
- What, da?
Ant bit me, pa
- Apply slaked lime paste
- It hurts badly, pa
Go and do it
I did the same as a toddler!
Father...where's my father?
Appa
Died 8 years ago, da
Ma...my mother?
Amma is here
She's in the next room
I'll fetch her, okay?
Ravi...?
- Amma!
- What happened, Ravi?!
I'm scared, ma
You'll be fine, my son
- I'm scared, ma
- Ravi
- Ravi
- I'm sooooo scared, ma
Aiyo! God help me
Oh my God!
- I'm really scared
- You're fine now
Nothing to worry, dear
[episode of 'Chithi']
'Chithi' is still being telecast?
'Aiyo! Save him!'
'He's going to die
He's dead now'
What happened?
Revive him
Get a buggy
Look, squad has come
Fatso! Kill them
Grab the loot and kill him, da!
- 'Stop playing, will you come to eat?'
- Mysskin, let's go
If you press and swipe up
it will get unlocked
Oh! Is it enough if we just touch?
Just a touch will do
Your aunt has invited you
for the baby shower
- Has my aunt come?
- Hey! Stop
WhatsApp, invited us
on the family group
Whats-
Is it dull?
Low battery
Here's the trimmer
We must go for your check up
Do you know how to use this?
My father had one
Shave like your father did
Wear his dress, it will fit you well
1st take a shower
Know how to bathe, right?
Don't be scared
That's my son Mysskin
He won't talk to anyone, go
Go, da, his head has to be tonsured
at our family deity's temple
My friend has come out of coma
after 16 years, sir
I'll take him for a check-up
and attend office tomorrow, sir
'Bro, I'm ready'
I thought you'll be like Jayam Ravi
You look like 'Nizhalgal' Ravi
This is the trend now
Do that again
Soooper!
Come on
Chennai has become like America
America?
Do you know how America is like now?
'It is so hot and
so much of traffic?'
'- I can't bear this heat
- This is the cold season'
'You haven't seen Chennai in May
Everyone will strip even their pants!'
See...our school students?
Same dumb faces!
How is Nikitha?
Which Nikitha?
My girlfriend, I say!
That girl, huh?
She must be married and
with a son as tall as you
Extend your right hand
Hey! I feel like seeing her
Flat tyre!
I want to meet her, da
Are you mad or what?
I told you she's married!
Please
Who else do I know?
I'll just go see her once
Ask her, 'Are you fine?'
That's all!
Don't blabber!
Just shut up
- For my sake-
- You're next, sir
- Excuse me, sir
- Yes
Good morning
Oh my God!!
I can't believe this
He came out of his coma?
No chance
Please sit down
His legs are fit to dance?!
'How did this happen
with my treatment?'
- Do it
- Do it, da
Wow! Good
Good...nice
Do it
Let me do this
instead of him
I'm good at it
"With your eyes expressive"
Do it
Perfect!
Were you consulting
this doctor all along?
- He's a good doctor
- Take that tablet
Tab, bro
Samsung tablet!
16 year lag, right?
That's how you'll react!
I'll send you a patient by name Ravi
Do a full body check up
There's no problem
He's totally fine
Super, doctor
Akka, sit down
Careful
Did no one accompany you?
No, only my husband
He had some important work to attend
- I slipped
- No...it's fine
- Shall I get you some water?
- No, thanks, I'm okay
But
2 points to remember
What is it, doctor?
First of all, at heart he is still
a 17 year old youngster
What happened?
You seem off color
I've lost 16 years of my life
I don't know what to do now
20 years for me
We've been childless for 20 years
But...it was my husband
who suffered the most
You know how badly
we were humiliated?
We used to wonder
why we were even alive
It hurt that much
But...we believed in God
He did not let us down
After 20 long years
Have faith in God
He'll take care of you, trust me
2nd point
He is bound to be most
psychologically affected now
Take a look
He didn't hear the alarm buzz
'So he woke up 15 minutes late
and missed his interview'
'Now he can't get back
the 15 precious minutes he lost'
'Neither can he attend that interview'
'Look how it manifests
as a terrible temper'
If this is the reaction
for just 15 minutes
He has lost 16 long years of his life
He must have had
a long wish list then
He is likely to get angry and
depressed he has missed all that
So if he wishes
for something, fulfill it
- Got it?
- Okay, doctor
Or else he might repent
thinking 'Why am I alive?'
One day he may-
Or to someone else
near him, he might-
Even you, he may-
- Doctor?
- Fun!
Oh shit!
'Don't do it, da!'
Will you take your medicine
or shall I inject you?
- Take it, kiddo
- Shall I stab you?
Do it...do it...just do it
Shut up your mouth, nurse
- What now?
- I want to see her
I have to see her now
- Doctor
- Fulfill his wish
Or else-
No worries
Let's see her now
Whether the year is 2000 or 3000...
...we friends are here to
unite you with your girlfriend
We'll definitely go, eh?
Don't do that
I get the jitters
What is this?
Facebook, I say
Before coma only emails , huh?
You won't understand ABC of this
Bro...this is like a park, da
Like a meeting place for all
You can talk to any girl
Cops won't hassle you
What you ate
What film you watched-
Even when they die they will inform
on this page and only then die
I intend searching for
your Nikitha in this park
My Nikitha won't frequent such parks
Will she be with some chap
in Marina beach?
My son is 3 years old
My son and wife roam around
only in this park
My wife is with some chap
in this park even after midnight
I don't even know
who that intruder is
If I send her a friend request she messages
'I'll kick you with a broomstick!'
How did you raise a sister like this?
- Okay, go ahead and search
- What a notorious family!
I've forgotten her face
- How does she look?
- Simply superb!
She was superb then
I'm sure she will be so-so now
Some heroine's photo, or rose or
chrysanthemum will be her display picture
Some vague photo
Watch me nab her in this park!
Bro...that's her
My Nikitha!
Studied at SVSS-
100% sure this is Nikitha
- Yes
- But everything is different!
Even I noticed that
Check in Phoenix Mall!
Bro, she has checked in
We can find her, hurry up
What's check in, bro?
Check in is telling the world
where you are!
Why is she announcing that?
Then her character is doubtful
Let us ask her
face to face, hurry up
She has informed the whole world
she is not at home
What if a thief breaks in then?
I'm racking my brains how we can
find her in that huge Phoenix Mall!
Hey! I've traced her in
Spencer's Plaza that's even bigger!
- What?!
- Spencer's Plaza
He's killing me with his ignorance!
Bro, that's Phoenix Mall
Your sister comes here often
without my knowledge
Oh mall!
Bro, stop
That car
- Look, that's Nikitha
- Where, da?
But she has changed
Really? Then I must
check her out too
She's like your sister
Stop drooling
- Hands off!
- She's mine, follow her
She has gone
Go...go
- Speed up
- Hey Nikitha!
- Go...go
- Wait, da
Why are all the houses carbon copies?
That's row house for you
We'll ask someone here
- We'll just see her, right?
- Simply see, that's all
- Then that dance?
- Just like that
- Just like that?
- Yes, jest for fun!
Okay, come on
'Undertaker, you are a Labrador
'You can't howl, silence!
Hey...hey!
- Doctor...you?
- What brings you here?
We came to meet someone
living in these row houses
- Here?
- Yes
- Who is it?
- Nikitha
Sounds very familiar
Full name?
- Nikitha Krishnamurthy
- Tell me, she is my wife
Can't be, she's my girlfriend
What is he saying?
Doctor, he is saying
your wife is his girl
Whaat?
What the hell are you talking?
Aiyaiyo! Sorry, doctor
I'll get it right this time
What he means is
...your wife is not his love interest
But he is interested in your wife
What the luck!
He got it this time
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Yes
Are you mad or what?
Nikitha!
What, doctor?
She...she-
She is my wife
What are you blabbering?
'Ravi...?!'
Doctor, before his coma
he was in love with Nikitha
That's why I brought him over, doctor
Sir, you were the one who suggested
All his wishes should be fulfilled
- That's why, sir
- So?
He wished for my-
Go to your room now
Doctor, is she our child?
My child!
I was curious
She didn't resemble you
You didn't come
even once to see me, right?
No...I thought you were dead!
They were discussing
about mercy killing
- 'She got me into trouble'
- Mercy killing?
2 times
Kidney and liver will go waste, that's why
Who gave you the right to decide?
If we had asked you,
would you have decided?
Sir, can we both talk in private?
Stuffing your feet into your mouth!
Sir, they want to discuss about their love
Why don't we have tea
at the street corner?
Sorry, sir
Whatever it is, ask her in front of him
I can ask whatever
right in front of him, huh?
- What would you have said?
- What?
You were about to reply
when I professed my love to you
What were you planning to say?
Tell me
Come on
I would have said 'no'
Hey! Don't be scared
uncle is here
Asking out of curiosity
What would you have said?
No...no
Thank God!
You say yes now, as if
I'll force you to elope with me?
Let go of her hand!
Not eloped as yet?
Come here, none of you
had better leave this place
Hey! Why are you
behaving like a lunatic?
- It's just infatuation
- Don't lie
The day I proposed
I saw your eyes feel shy,
lips smile and nose twitch
Even I have not seen
my wife react like this
This is private conversation
Keep out of it
- She is my wife
- I'm her lover, sir
Hey! Letting your tongue run
because I'm keeping quiet
I'm telling you
I didn't love you!
1st get out of here
Coming here like an idiot
after 16 long years
He was stupid enough
to bring you, leave now
If I ever step near your front door
you can spit on my face!
Spit on his face too!
Let's go
I'll spit on your face
for sure if you come again
'Thinks he's superman or what?!'
'Undertaker, shut up'
So what if she isn't in your life?
She's past expiry date
But I'm still shelf worthy, right?
I was the one who taught you how
to hook a girl and make the right move
You were our friend, philosopher and guru
So what if she isn't my girl!
By the time I snap my fingers,
I'll find another chic-
Want to see a sample of my skill?
Want to see me in action?
How many years it has been
seeing you like this, come on
She is also eyeing you
Go for the kill, show your skill!
Watch me now
"I make a scene without reason
I'm the school don for every season"
"Rain or shine I show off mighty"
After 16 years I'll see you
in action only now
Go...go...!
- Sis, please move aside
- 'Please go'
Excuse me
What is the time now?
Ehhhhh!
- When is 13B bus expected?
- Sorry
- Come on
- I'm in your neighboring school
Why are you cradle snatching?
What is the time?
When is T.Nagar bus due?
This is how you strike a conversation
- Those are-
- Listen
- Watch me now
- What?
"Won't the breeze that blows know
the flower waiting to bloom aglow?"
[song from 'Ullasam']
Follow for a month without any break
- That is it
- You'll be branded a psycho killer!
Come, da
'Sit down'
'Dropping a letter
and staring like Cupid!'
'Flinging a flower and smiling
like a Casanova are all...here'
Tamil romantic films of the late 90s
This is love
That is not love
'Alai Payuthe'
'- What are you searching?
- Wedding chain'
How can she hang
her wedding chain like that?
These days they fall in love
hiding their own children!
Okay...love
'Kushi'
Waist
'Kushi' was a box office hit
for that tempting waist!
'Vallavan'
Seems to be a good man
- Is that so?
- Play this
'- Can't wait, where is the bedroom?
- Upstairs'
Hey! This isn't love
Not love at all!
Yes, but nowadays this is only love
Hey, you haven't watched
'OK Kanmani', right?
You would have scooted
Sit quiet now
Everything moves fast these days
You should also be fast
- I'll be sooooper fast
- So quick...ly!
Listen, we can go fast
but in reverse direction
After this, if you meet a girl
and fall in love with her
Then you figure out
your castes differ and break up
- After that can you find a girl?
- No way
That's why this laptop
Look at this
Mudaliar matrimony
Chettiar matrimony
Iyer matrimony
Do people still obsess about caste?
You haven't read
the newspapers, right?
They openly advertise in public
only about caste
But I don't belong to any caste
Blame your father for it!
Okay then, the bride
I'll find for you...
...is a girl listed as 'caste no bar'
Which means all castes not outcast!
Aiyaiyo!
Why is it empty?
Can't find here either
Looks like it's a dead end!
'Not here either!'
'Tamil matrimony'
Finally lucky!
One and only ducky!!
Reethika...!
She is Divya's friend
Hey, sit down
Even if you know her
shouldn't talk in person
1st send a 'Friend request' on Facebook
- That is one stage
- No, I feel like puking
After sending the 'Friend request'
...you must get
her WhatsApp #
This is one stage
After 2 messages, I have
no clue what to chat
Then you go to the next stage
First click her #
on your 'Contacts' list
'Her phone will ring'
'Her ears will hear it'
'Eyes will look'
'Her feet will walk towards it'
'Her hand will pick up the phone
and her finger will swipe'
- 'Her lips'

Accept milk and fruits as my offering"
"Scented camphor I'll light for you
I want you daily in my life anew"
"Are you ready?"
"Are you ready?"
Actually 1st time even I saw you
only in that birthday party
'You seemed really different'
'Everyone there was busy
with their mobiles'
'You were the only one
talking to the guests over there'
'I liked that'
You also looked unique to me
'Why?'
Even the so-so girls were escorted
'But you came by yourself'
Only because some girls
like you are still single...
...few chaps like me are still alive!
"No need of lipstick for your honeyed lip
Your moonlit eyes need no kohl as fillip"

No one else will do"

Got into the mood?
Next stage is meeting
Which means?
I'll handle that
I should unlock it like this
This is to take a selfie
Then ATM PIN #
Aiyo! Your jeans is torn
Everybody is looking
- Everyone is-
- They go about their work
We attend to ours
No one will bother about anything
Anyway, hiiii!
It seems when you meet
for the 1st time, they take a selfie!
Okay, sure
Okay
'Everything moves fast these days'
'You should also be fast'
Fast
'They go about their work'
'We attend to ours'
'No one will bother about anything'
'I'll also move fast'
'Fast move'
'Ban the Beep song'
'Ban the Beep Song
that shames women'
CHEE!!
Bloody scumbags!
Won't you spare a single girl?
Hey!
'Hands off!'
She wanted to be kis-
Slipper this mongrel!
'Won't you let a girl walk
safely on the road?'
Listen to me
'Why are you torturing us women?'
'Call yourself a human being!
Kissing a girl in public!!'
Please hear me out
'You should be beaten black and blue
Weren't you born with sisters?'
Divya, isn't this your brother?
'He has to pay for this sin'
'He's sucking her lips with his!'
Hey! Let's go
'Video of a girl being forcefully kissed
in broad daylight in a public place'
'Are women secure?'
'Women's Associations protest'
Your brother? Looks like
he's from a decent family?
'He's such a Casanova!'
'Releasing him because of your pleas
Or else I would've arrested him'
'Rascal! Take him away'
Sit down
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, huh?
I feel so humiliated
How old do you think you are?
'Still running behind girls!'
What are you doing with your life, huh?
Are you working?
Simply fritter away time and-
'My husband is working
his butt out for you also'
Get this into your head
Singlehanded he took care of
your medical expenses
1 minute
Do you know what this is?
Duplicate document of this house
We don't have the original
At one point unable to
pay your medical bills...
...we took a loan from the bank
Unable to pay that bank loan...
...this house is about to be seized now
Do you know how many people
dream to own a house?
This house is our dream
We have to fend for our 2 children
and their education
In case we come to the streets
along with our children
...no one is responsible for it
Only you!
This little boy
We still don't know why
he doesn't talk to anyone
Entire apartment complex
looks at him weirdly
My husband and I take him
to one psychiatrist after another
'You're adding insult to injury now!'
The moment boys turn 20
...they will be so ashamed to
ask their parents for money
You are 34 years old!
Will you please keep quiet today?
Even now only that man
provides you food
Do you know why?
Because you are my brother
and that is the only reason
Please try and get a job for yourself
Why the heck did you
come out of your coma!
Dai!
Why didn't you tell me about your loan?
You've already lost half your life
How will it help if I tell you?
But one small correction
I didn't do any of this
because you're her brother
You are my friend!
I must find myself some job
Please do that
Haven't you taken a photo
for many years?
- Yes, sir
- Why?
I was in coma for 16 years
Coma?
Good
Sounds good
- Where is Coma?
- In Canada, didn't you know?
Now I remember
My cousin lives there
'Don't you feel ashamed?'
Either you vacate the house
or repay the loan
'You know how to avail a loan
Does it hurt to repay?'
'And we have to run behind you?'
'What a wild goose chase!'
'I am asking you
And you're staring at me?'
'We have to put an end to this'
'We must seal this house this month'
'You got all the comforts
But can't repay?'
- Planning to cheat us?
- Pay up, sir
You make handmade statuettes?
We are at different level nowadays
with machine and 3D printer
When will you make it
and when will I be able to sell it!
Even to secure an office boy's job
you need to have computer knowledge
'Scored only 70% in 10th grade
You haven't completed 12th grade'
'Sir, how many times to tell you?'
'Don't stand here, sir
We have no vacancy'
'- Please go, sir
- Talking of floppy disks now!'
'You don't know what an 'app' is?
How will you deliver food?'
Give me the balance
I have to go, bro
Hey! This is only the balance
2 tea is 20 bucks
1 cigarette is 15 bucks
What balance do you want?
It was just tea then
Now it is GST!
- 20 bucks?!
- Wait, bro
- Don't make me hit you
- Take, bro
Want to fly a kite with me?
Did he get a job?
Will you come and eat, anna?
Sorry, anna
Aiyo! It's alright, dear
No, I'm really apologizing, bro
I just lost my temper and-
Sorry
I understand
Whatever you said makes sense
I've really become
good-for-nothing
Everyone is either a doctor,
engineer, salesman, driver
Some sort of identity
But I have nothing to my name
Don't be so pessimistic
You are very talented
You used to make statues
I can't even get a biscuit
for your son with that skill!
I believe 1 cup of tea is 20 bucks
Bro, I'll tell you something
- You won't get me wrong?
- Go ahead
In my friend's office...
...there is a vacancy for a watchman
Will you go?
Yov! What are you doing?
No, sir, this is similar
to my school uniform
Wear your gloves, check and
send them in like how I demonstrated
Forever making silly excuses!
What I'm about to do
will make you feel awkward
Likewise me too
But it's my job
Bro...?
Bro...!
- Bro
- What is it?
What?
Go inside
'Oh my God!'
'Look who is here!'
Yov!
- Where are you going?
- No
Do your job...go
But you shouldn't misbehave with girls
Will all the girls be
like your friend Reethika?
That friend I mentioned is Reethika!
I have to check
Enough...enough
- I must check what is in there
- I said enough
I must follow orders
I have no other choice
You have to check only men, go
Even here, you won't
let me do the job I like
- Listen
- What?
- Want to check before I leave?
- No, not at all
Many paintings in this museum
get sold for a hefty sum I heard
I painted these when I was young
How much will they fetch?
- Rs 200
- That's all?
All these together 50 bucks
Do you know how artistic sense should be?
Should be like that
That's for 5 million!
This is art?!
Don't hold a grudge and
reduce the rate drastically
Very funny!
Listen
I was angry with you, it's true
But I understood after your sister
explained everything to me
That was a pure act of innocence
So I have no specific dislike towards you
Only because I like you
I came to see you the other day
But like a madcap if you ask me
to quote a price, what can I do?
True, I am mad!
I'm in a pathetic position now
That's why I'm clutching at straws
I'll somehow find a way out!
Oh!
But it was a tad too pathetic!
[alarm blaring]
I suspected right then
you were hiding something
- Lift your hands
- Not me
That's the building alarm
Something has been stolen
- Go and call the police
- Okay
Cops are on their way
They are coming, right?
'On their way!'
He seems to be quite the pro!
Yuck! Don't lick me
Hello, police?
Wait, take me also
'Give it'
Oh God! The statue!
Do you know the value
of what you're holding?!
10 million!
- Don't let go!
- 10 million?
Hold it tight
I'll hold it tight
Did you call the cops?
'The cops have arrived'
Sir, these are the culprits
Sir, you still come
only at the last minute?
Very good
Thank God, it is worth millions
It belongs to the royal dynasty
Everyone is filing a petition
claiming ownership now
You'll be shocked when you look at it
Got a good look?
Didn't I say you'll be shocked?
Thank God! Good job
Yov! This belongs to me
Hey...hey...!
IT BELONGS TO ME!
- Ravi, stop!
- What are you doing?
Yes, of course
This statuette was in our house
So you really belong to a royal family?
- Royal family?!
- Appaaaaa!
This family?
Don't be too shocked
That's history
Done and dusted!
For many generations now
we are a very normal family
And your father...oh God!
'All people are equal'
and his ideologies!
But I swear I didn't know
that statuette would be so priceless!
Appa!
Waste of a father-in-law!
Why is this so valuable?
Come, I'll tell you
- Appa, throw me again
- I'm going out
Hey! Play 'throw me' game with him
He is the reason
King Ellisai
'You belonged to the Ellisai kingdom'
'An ancient dynasty'
'Beyond wealth, treasures,
bravery and prosperity...'
'...they were pioneers in designing weapons
to be used in everyday life'
'That is...'
'They are famous for the ancient art
of making 'Dhokra' statuettes'
'Your lineage was destroyed by-'
I know how
With the advent of the British
No, you were destroyed by womanly wiles
Your royal family had
a weakness for women, da
Weakness for women?
'B.C 136
The Harem'
You said you liked it
My gift to you
If you like it, take it!
'B.C. 1070'
If you like it...take it!
'B.C. 1169'
How did you lose that statuette?
'B.C 20th century'
'You like it?
Take it'
It isn't important now
how I lost our heirloom
It is important to find out
who has it now!
Your Majesty
Shut up, da!
Who has it now?
A politician has it
MLA...?
This is Breaking News now
'Owner of a statuette belonging to
the royal family, worth millions'
'...is Dharmaraj, MLA of Sigalapatti
according to our sources'
'Imprisoned for a corruption scandal'
'...he was released only last month'
'There are many murder, kidnapping
and kangaroo court cases against him'
'His original name is Dharma'
'He was arrested in
Gaaja's murder case'
'...is of specific interest'
You must all be aware of my royal lineage
from my heroic deeds and brave conduct
There's no necessity for me
to prove it with that statuette
But there are almost 100 petitions
from people claiming ownership it seems
Do you know what it reminds me of?
See for yourself
Actor Dinesh is my son!
Somehow unite him with me, his real mother
- Actor Dinesh is really my son
- My son
Did you see that?
'That actor is my son'
'I am chief minister's daughter'
This claim is as comical
I have just one fact to share
with those 100 petitioners and clowns
Many duplicates can exist
But there's only 1 original
And that is Dharmaraj!
I'll send that statuette
on the 20th of this month...
...to our Govt for inspection
After I get Govt approval
...I'll donate that statuette
to the Indian Govt for free
Whaaat?! Who is giving
whose Dhokra to the Govt?
Politics...!
He will earn much more
than the value of this statuette
On top of this
caste votes
Those who belong to the royal lineage
will mostly fall within 3 communities
These 3 communities claim
Dharmaraj is their man
And are fighting
within themselves
To put it simply, Dharmaraj gets
the support of these 3 castes
He won't easily part with
such a priceless statuette
Is caste politics played to
such an extent with this statuette?
How did he become an MLA?
Only they rule the roost now
They even try for chief ministership
You have no chance
No chance I'll let it go either
I've found it
after so many years!
It's mine
-I'll somehow prove it
- Please do that
I can pay up the loan
and retrieve my house
I have an idea
Statuette will reach his house
in another 2 days
You go and ask him
He will refuse for sure
But record what you both speak
on a button camera
- Button camera?
- Yes
This is a button camera
This is a clock camera
- This is a 'brief' camera
- Underwear?
- So keep the button here
- And then?
I mean fix it in your shirt
and record your conversation
Let us go and buy that button
Hello, hello...!
You won't get it in a shop
You must order it in the internet
Let's go to the internet and buy it
Internet means
Flip card or Amazingon card!
Come, hit the button
How will we get the item?
As if he'll deliver it
at your doorstep!
Of course, that's what he will do
Aiyayo! Then he'll know our plan
He won't barge into your bedroom
He'll leave it at your doorstep
But even then-
Trust me as an IT student!
Now look there
I'll order it
Will it be delivered today?
How will you pay for it?
Through this, huh?
Bank transfer...?
If the item doesn't work
will he take it back?
- What if it's a duplicate?
- Everything in Tamil Nadu is a duplicate
- That's all, eh?
- Done!
- Bro, then-
- You'll get it
You will get it
Till what time at night
will he deliver?
Will he come even on
Saturday and Sunday?
Then on all festivals and functions?
What do you think of yourself?
He's also a human being
like you and me!
I didn't mean that-
Listen, it will take more than
4 days to be delivered
Until then, shut your gob!
- 4 days
- What, da?
Your uncle threw the rice down
Pick it up and eat
Kneel down!
'What will I do till then?'
Hey Mysskin
I'm bored
Let's play cricket
Hey! Come on

It won't reach you

He's bugging me!
You said office is closed today?
Work from home, da
I know home work
What's this 'work from home'?
IT means you must work from home too
- For so long?
- He won't help with house work
What? I ate
Hang up now
Who is this now?
My mother, da
She's at my brother's place
You cut the call so soon?
What will she ask?
Did you eat, sleep?
That's all...?
Who else in this world other than your amma
will ask if you've eaten or slept well?
You speak to strangers
for hours at a stretch
Why not to your mother, da?
How sad is that!
Hello...did you eat, ma?
You said it was a small button camera...!
You're prepping me

Someone will attend to you
It's 4'o clock
I'll go drink my cup of tea
Why inform us about his tea routine?
Maybe he has no one to talk to
Poor fellow!

If we get caught, harakiri
Total genocide!
You seem vaguely familiar
When you came here we were there
You must have seen us then, sir
No chance at all, bro
Get my charger, da
I will prove to the world
the statuette Dharmaraj has is mine
He's going with camera to MLA's place
'Hello, I'm Ravi here'
16 years in coma
'Poor chap!'
'I don't know whether to laugh
or feel sorry for you'
- Which channel?
- 'Comali'
- 'Did you wake up to torture me?'
- Must be MLA's house
Let's go
'Aiyo! So sad'
I agree, that statuette is...
...not mine
'Only you know that'
But as far as this city is concerned...
...it is mine
To claim that statuette is yours
...what proof do you have?
You know very well
...that statue-
'Hey! Why are you jerking around?'
What happened?
Short circuit because he's sweating
We are done for!
Tell me
What proof do you have?
Now look here and tell me
'Go on'
He's churning his knife
like 'dhal' down my throat!
Please blurt it out
Sir...you know very well
You took it from me and-
- Why are you prancing around?
- Why, da?
Chi! Get up
Chi! You also get up
I'll close my eyes, you get up
Now look here
I don't care what proof you have
Do you know why?
Those who derided me
as an illegitimate kid
All those who tore my dignity to shreds
When they knew I have a royal lineage
Please take your tablet, Your Majesty!
They want to make me a minister
You are a rascal
with none of these privileges
Do you think I'll part
with that priceless statuette?
It belongs to me
Wave whatever magic wand you have!
Goddess...help me!
Looks like he will get possessed here
Beat him to a pulp and chase him
Thank God!
- Get lost!
- Wait, bro
- I'll make them run with this video!
- How?
- Go see what he is upto
- Okay, bro
[humming a song]
Hey! What is that?
- Don't
- What do you mean by that?
You'll get electrocuted
if you touch me
Think you're actor Vijaykanth or what!
He is creating a scene
as if he has seizures
One swift blow-
He's streaming everything 'live', nab him
What is he saying?
'Don't pull me
Wait, I'll oblige'
They found out our plan, you leave
Someone else is outside
Go, get them
He got us in trouble too!
- Get the key
- I don't have it
- Who has it then?
- Car key is with me
You dunderhead!
"Am I the joker?"
"You are the court jester
who will end up as the sucker"
"Who is the prankster?"
What is 'live'?
He is uploading the events here online
- Let him, so what?
- Whole world will know!
Did I hear you right?
Goodness gracious!!
"Clown, funster"
"Joker of the year"
"Prankster, punster dear"
"Joker, buffoon"
"Jokester, clown"
What is he doing?
"Quipster"
"Wisecracker"
"For 16 years a comatose patient in bed
Get into the arena, doomsday ahead"
Don't hit me
I can't bear the pain
"Comatose patient, one and only
Gagster of the year, Coma-li!"
Oh gawd!
I'll hurl it right this time
You don't have to save me at all
Can we know what is happening here, sir?
Do you already know Ravi
who streamed events 'live'?
That is a matter of-
Handing them over to the cops?
Then he has to count bars too!
When signal got cut,
were you attacked?
'What...when was I attacked?'
When signal got cut,
were you attacked?
What are you ask-
How will you tackle these allegations?
'Bro, look at this'
'I agree, that statuette is mine'
'I agree, that statuette is mine'
'Got cut'
Short circuit
because he's sweating
Complete your comment, sir
- What will you do, sir?
- Wait...wait
- What is your reply?
- What will I do?
I'll forgive them
and let them go
They wanted to be
the talk of the town
They stoop to do all this
to grab 2 minutes of limelight
Poor fellow!
He is mentally affected
'He was lying in coma for many years
and just regained consciousness'
Out of goodness of my heart
I'll help him to the best of my ability
I always stick to this tagline
There can be only 1 original
That is...!
Only he will say so!
I'll do whatever I can
for you as well...huh?
God bless you
'I became very popular online'
'Minimum % for good issues'
'Maximum % for the flip side'
'Nowadays people lap up negativity'
'I became the troll king!'
'I am not to be blamed'
'I forgot to connect the battery'
Aiyo!
Ravi, you are being trolled,
trampled and crucified!
At least change your dress
Looks like you had a dressing down!
I won't!
At least that button-
Madam, I am from ICIS bank
- Tell me
- Is sir not at home?
- He is there
- Good
Do I look like a nincompoop?
You are not picking my call?
Sir, don't be offensive
Not paying your dues is defensive?
But if I'm offensive
I'll tell you with due respect!
In another 30 days
if you don't pay minimum 3 million
...we will rip you apart!
Don't think we'll pluck
our locks of hair in frustration
We will punch your face
with our left hand
Son of a gun!
Is it necessary for you to be
on the wrong side of law, sonny?
So Mr Shameless, junk of a jerk,
armpit rumple stink skin
5h17 face, disgusting piece of deer poop
Lousy lavatory, poo loo,
king of nastiness, muck of yuckiness
Brother of shame, undies itch,
sore galore and more
Nose digger, pustule pimple,
scheming seepage
Even a street dog will be faithful lifelong
if fed with biscuits just worth Rs 5
With your 6th sense, don't you shudder
in shame when you sleep at night?
You hit us if we ask
for our rightful dues?
Not 1 month, in 1 week
your house will be seized!
- I'll repay your money in just 1 week
- Oh yes, royal lineage!
Like it or not, yes I am!
Why did you hit him now?
Heard his string of cuss words?
It's casual, no big deal
I'll show you
Hey! You ******!
Hi, bro
- Shut your gob, scumbag!
- Hi friends
Saw how he reacted so casually?
Is this your father's house?
My father gave it to me
'Sir, this is a smuggled piece of antique'
'It is being reported
you head the mafia'
'What is your opinion?'
'1000s of people malign you in our city'
'If you let them affect you
can you review films?'
'I am asking you in ignorance
just to prove my innocence to the people'
'...can I take a snap shot
every year holding that statuette?'
'From when I was a toddler'
'Can I take a snap shot
every year holding that-'
[echoing words]
'From when I was a toddler'
Eureka!! I got it
I finally found it
Got what?
Nikitha clicked a photo of us
in that exhibition, right?
- Yes
- That's our proof of ownership
Hit the nail on that head!
Let's go, right now
What is it?
When Nikitha clicked that photo
...Suresh walked up and down
hiding the statuette you were holding
Was he sitting or standing?
Hey!
Don't worry, I'll call him
I have his number
- Hello...?
- Hello, machi
16 years ago
'Remember we clicked a photo
in our high school exhibition?'
Were you sitting or standing then?
- We had exhibitions, huh?
- 'Yes, you fat buffalo!'
You got any photo
send it to me
He wants me to send the photo?!
Were you sitting or standing?
Tell me now
Very important
Think I was sitting
- He was sitting, let's go
- Super
'If I ever step near your door step
you can spit on my face!'
Yuck!
Why did he spit?
- Doctor's way of saying hello
- His habit!
Come in
'Aiyo!'
Hello!
Look here
Tell me
- When we were in school
- I said look at me, right?
Look at me and speak
- You heard me?
- No...no, sir
You won't know the answer
It's a matter between
your wife and me 16 years ago
- What are you saying?
- Baby, will you keep quiet?
I thought I was your 1st girlfriend
He's explaining
Kid is curious, no?
We will also learn about it
- Chi! Shut up
- Why?
- What 'matter'?
- That is
What is it about? Tell me
When I proposed to you,
I gave you a statuette, remember?
Its value has skyrocketed to millions
Hey baby...baby!
But it is not with me now
It is with Dharmaraj
All that matters is
if you give me that photo
I didn't even develop that negative
because I didn't want to remember you
She is my wife...my wife, you know
But I have those negatives safe
She is my girlfriend, you see
- Lover, huh?
- I was her ex lover!
Only ex, huh?!
We'll discuss that later!
Why are you fighting for that girl?
Let's look for the negative
Right, Nagaraj?
He has given permission, stand up
You look in the attic
- You look there, da
- Da?!
Yes, short form of darling is 'da'!
Short form of dear is 'di'!
Ravi taught me this acronym in school
I might have said it
At least I am consistent!
'You search over there'
'4 eyed bozo!'
I landed!
Not here, pappumma
- Pappumma?
- My pet name for her in school
Chocolate wrapper
Don't throw so callously
My college lover gave these
What...college lover?
I should react to that
Why are you getting tense?
Rat snake, I'll smash and
stuff you into that drawer!
Either search or sleep in your snake pit!
- Is this your office lover?
- Yes
Ma, what is this uncle's name?
You go search that side
By the way, why have you
developed his photo alone?
I didn't love him truly
He doesn't make my heart race!
Means you loved me truly?
I didn't love you at all
I didn't develop the photo
Go and search
Yes, I am the winner!
Where is it?
"Drizzle of love, sizzling love
Where did you fall from above?"
- Hey! Don't touch that
- All the more reason I will
Randy fellow!
'Call center Kokila'
'ABC of all you want to know'
'Yes, dear, not here'
'Shall we have a blast?'
Doctor!
Come down
Come down, man
You'll get it from me
He tore my family life to tatters!
Where is that negative?
Negative...negative...!
Pappumma, move this side
Come this side
Quick...quick
He has lifted her!
Quick...double quick
What a bloody mess?!
Shall we go there?
Brother, if you go straight,
bedroom is to your left
- Slightly comfortable
- Super!
Please stop touching and
start searching, brother
Go inside
Pappumma...!
He and his pat my lap!
Make it fast...quick quick quickly!
Yaaaaaaay!
I FOUND IT!
NOOOO!
Dhokra is all yours!
Hey! Crazy coot of a doctor!
If you expose the film to light,
won't it be destroyed?
If you put it in, will it develop?
Chi! Take it out
Son of 'Haste makes waste'!
Sorry, boss
I use only digital camera
'If I claim ownership of
that dhokra statuette, people will'
...call you a 'clown'!
'On the 20th of this month...'
'...I'll donate that statuette to
our Govt with no strings attached'
'In 1 week your house will be seized!'
'In case we come to the streets'
'...no one is responsible for it'
'Only you!'
'It belongs to me'
'Wave whatever magic wand you have!'
Carry me
Lift me up
Lift me
Lift, ma
Will lift
We'll lift
We'll flick that statuette
No other go
The whole world knows
Dharma has it in his possession
If you take it, won't you be
branded a thief?
Govt has not tested it as yet
Only after 5 days it will be
sent to the archaeology department
Let's replace it with a duplicate
and flick the original
We can sell it illegally outside
We can do it, right?
If you age-test it
....original can be discerned
from the duplicate
Can be done
It's possible
1 minute
You intend stealing?
Not 'you' intend stealing?
'We' will steal!
Why should I join hands with you?
You searched with us, no?
Now steal with us!
- That's no logic at all
- No logic but what to do?
Shall I be logical?
If I say your wife is my girl
don't you get mad, huh?
Similarly
Retrieving my property
is stealing or not?
But to me it is stealing
Yuck! Are you such a lowlife?
You destroyed his life
and speaking like this?
I'm sorry, Ravi
You destroyed your own patient's life
Take an empty shot and die!
Call yourself a doctor? Chee!
Dad, uncle is only correct
Okay...okay...!
Okay, I'll do whatever help I can
But don't say I destroyed someone's life
Fine, I'll help you
'It has started to rain in Chennai
Showers may last for a week'
1st we should...
...try to see how to take it from him
'Office calling'
'Office calling'
We should know when he is at home
And when he will step out
Superb idea, machan
Okay, in order to track the beasts
and their movements in the forest...
...like how surveillance cameras are fixed
Hey! All that won't work
I'm talking
Don't interrupt
If we keep a similar camera
in front of his house-
Listen, it won't work!
Hey! Zip your lips
You don't know anything
After we fix the cameras-
What is it I don't know?
Tell me
I wanted to learn whatever I missed
when I had slipped into coma
With your help
I learnt everything
What's up with all of you?
Obsessing about camera, Facebook, message
With technology you think you are
getting closer but actually moving away
No one is talking
face to face directly
You said it is a decade
since you saw your classmate
When I asked you his address
you said some darn park!
When we were in school...
...if cricket was at 7:00 a.m
won't we assemble on the dot?
- We'll be there at 6:30!
- Bingo but now?
'Reached, where are you?
Cancelled, huh?'
You chat only on WhatsApp
No one is on the ground there
Hacker, how many friends on Facebook?
'4000'
Ask them for a simple favor
Not a single soul will come to your aid
You will wish 'Happy birthday, ma'
to a mother who is not on Facebook!
How will she know you wished her?
Then for whom are you doing all this?
Some random girl
you don't even know
You'll chat with her
for hours on Facebook
But to meet her in person
You don't have the guts, why?
Because that is reality
All of you have started
being scared of reality
Genuine friends
Pure happiness
Real comfort
True birthday wish
You have no idea
what all these really mean
Sir, tell me your wife's phone #
Without checking your mobile
Can you tell me from memory, sir?
16 years ago
her landline #
I remember it even now
22582999
Why?
Because it is embedded here
For all of you it is here
Trying to make humans into
machines and vice versa
I don't understand why
Bro-in-law
You were worried
your son doesn't talk
How will he talk?
Why will he talk?
He doesn't have anyone to talk to
I spoke to him
But one thing is for sure
All these years
I was not the one lying in coma
All of you slipped into coma!
Please wake up now
I'm saying it only because
I've understood all this
We can't attack him
with this technology
If you fix a camera,
he'll show you how you fixed it
We must use some other technique
Something else
'Office calling'
Why is this ringing nonstop?
If my father went to work at 8
he'll be back home by 6:00 p.m
Next day he'll go at 8 again
This mobile rings 24x7
We get calls while eating, sleeping,
even when we are in the loo
Not only that, you get calls and
messages all the time...oh gawd!
The world is so big out there
you're a corpse in that small box!
Break that...break that damn device
No...no...no...!
BREAK IT!
'Office calling'
Good riddance to 'office calling'!
- Just you wait!
- Don't break it, uncle
Doctor, let go of me!
I'll break my boss's head!
Uncle, don't do that
Dai, why did you break this phone now?
As if I did?
You instigated me to break it
I know I spoke but
why did you break it?
Isn't it your phone?
I broke it in a burst of emotion
Dai!
So all these years emotion has
been a constant, right?
We must lock Dharmaraj
by using emotion as the key
Do any of you understand me?
Wait...how do I say it?
Technology you are raving about
is recent and it will keep changing
But feelings we were born with
Hunger, taste, happiness, anger,
love, lust will never change
Our mothers showed us
the moon and fed us
Mothers these days show
their mobiles and feed their babies
But feeding has not changed, right?
That love has not changed, right?
Certain things won't change
It will be old as gold
I'm the king of heritage & culture!
Pah! Incredible scene
Just tell me what to do
I'm ready
We don't need surveillance cameras
to check on Dharmaraj's movements
This human being will do
'A lonely watchman will
welcome with open arms'
'...someone who respects
and chats with him'
If we want to befriend someone
ideal is to make them laugh
Problem is he can identify us
So-
Doctor, it's no big deal
You just approach him casually
to ask an address and crack a joke
It is a bland joke but as soon as
you tell him you start laughing
Then he has to laugh
What is the joke?
'Then mozhi, Kani mozhi, Ilam mozhi'
- Is this a joke?
- Too much!
- Do you know this address?
- This one?
Yes, the same
So very simple
Tomorrow go up to him and-
Won't he get suspicious?
Right, but if you take your dog
for a walk, even if it is another area
- 'No one will suspect you'
- Cooperate with me
- Bro
- Walking, huh?
Look! My dog is saying 'yes'
Can't meet your boss at all these days?
- He's very busy
- When did you come?
- I came yesterday at 6:00 a.m
- He comes only at 10'o clock
- I came at 8:00 p.m, bro
- He leaves by 3:00 p.m usually
Shall I come at 2:00 p.m tomorrow?
At 2:00 p.m he is garlanding
our leader's statue
OH!
Bye, bro
Caste
[crowd cheering]
Yov! Are you God's gift to mankind
just because of your royal lineage?
Until yesterday, you were
an illegitimate mongrel
Who the hell are you?
Who the eff are you?
Silence...silence!
Make way for our leader
Move aside
You come along, bro
Get out of my way
Hey! Move
- I'll kill you
- They locked me in, bro
You are bleeding, bro?
'If you wash fish in clean water daily
Will it lose its innate stink, tell me?'
Will it go, man?
That...was not aimed at your hand, man
It was aimed at your neck!
Rope of Lord Yama,
God of Death
...is now in the hands
of your close associate
Someone by your side always
will send you to the grave
Sins you committed
these 16 long years...
...have started rolling
their dice against you
Your steps are heading towards the grave
What...?
Don't you believe me?
Only if you are alive
the day after tomorrow!
Do you want to look for
redemption of your sins?
Visit Lord Shiva at Rudra temple
and beg for salvation
Your fort is crumbling
Your game is tumbling
Your chapter is closed, man
Suspicion, superstition
Fear
Now whatever happens
will be ominous in his eyes
Hey! Black cat
Stop...stop!
'Tomorrow is your last day!!!'
Hey! Catch him
Get hold of him
How can you nab him
if all of you are seated?
Scum bags!
This is an offer from
Lalitha Jewellery
Tomorrow is the last day it seems!
Hey! Having a dig at me?
Start the car
That doesn't work, bro
- Only my seat belt is stuck?
- Yes
- Okay, take this left
- No, we can turn right, bro
No need
Turn left now
- I'll turn right
- Turn left now
If we turn right
we'll reach our final destination
Final destination?
Is this some conspiracy?
- Why are you going right?
- Hey! Go right
Turn left, I say
Where are you off to?
Sir, I have to attend
to the next patient
Please come back soon
I'm a bit scared
- What's this?
- Milk
You drink it
No need, bro
Drink it, man
- I don't want, bro
- Why?
If it's plain milk I don't mind
What did you mix then?
I added sugar
I am diabetic!
No one is disease free in our group-
You drink it
I don't want, bro
Do you have high blood pressure?
- You can't trust him, bro
- Bloody traitor of a tortoise!
How dare you, couch potato!
Bro, even now he created
bad blood in the function
- To start a commotion
- True that!
Who is a spinning top with no hook?
'Whole world knows
you are vegetating!'
'I knew from the beginning
he should not be trusted'
Move, why are you fighting here?
'Instead of giving apple to our boss?'
Nurse
Discharge!
[dog howling]
I can hear a dog howling
My heart is racing
I'm scared too
[sinister whispers]
What is this?
Why are you standing all around me?
You are even holding weapons
You are in some trouble, bro
Problem for me?
Problem is only because of all of you
How are we to blame?
Who slashed my arm?
I went to the temple for your sake
and brought you God's offerings, bro
Why is that blade in your hand?
So are you the culprit?
You wretched fellow!
How could you do this to our bro?
You refused to trust me
Look how he backstabbed you!
'Come out and we know
how to handle you!'
'Tomorrow is the last day!'
'We'll reach our final destination'
'He isn't trustworthy, bro'
'We'll reach our final destination'
'He isn't trustworthy, bro'
'Visit Lord Shiva at Rudra temple
and beg for salvation'
If he gets scared...
Hey!
He's the traitor
Listen, I don't trust any of you
All of you clear out right now
- Leave
- Bro
Are you scared, bro?
- Is it that obvious?
- Yes, bro
At least for a week, go
I don't want anyone with me
Leave me alone
GO NOW
Banu, listen
Make arrangements for me
to go to the temple tomorrow
Before the inauspicious time tomorrow
he will set out to the temple
'Watchman will go to
drink tea at 4:00 p.m'
'It's 4'o clock
I'll go drink my cup of tea'
We should enter in that gap
So we should ensure
the watchman doesn't return
But how...?
I'll suggest something
But no one should yell at me
Shoot
Desire!
Aunty...?
You haven't aged one bit
'We will mix a sedative in that batter'
Someone will be in his house
His mother or wife, right?
What do you say, Nagaraj?
- For sure
- Then?
We'll enter claiming to be their relatives
'Whoever it is, we generally talk
to strangers outside the door'
'But if a relative turns up
with an invitation'
I'm your uncle from Malayanur, dear
'They won't be suspicious'
'They will open their doors wide
invite the guests in'
'That is our tradition
and our famous hospitality'
- Who are they, ma?
- I don't know, da
How can I ask?
Must be from your father's side
So you, me, Nikitha, doctor
- We will go to his house
- What about me?
If there's some problem tomorrow
we will all be behind bars
We need someone to bail us out, right?
So don't come there
I have an important meeting
in my office tomorrow
Why don't you all go?
Even the doctor is willing
What's your problem?
So...?
So...?
Yov security!
I'm going to the temple
Take care of the house
'Okay, sir'
'We are waiting
All roads are flooded'
'But still as per our weather forecast
heavy downpour expected'
'So be safe wherever you are'
What about the CCTV camera?
She seems to be new to this area
How does area matter
for a mobile eatery?
'Taste my hot 'bhajji'
in this rain, sir'
Vanakkam, how are you?
Vanakkam
'We've been childless for 20 years'
- You are...?
- Your uncle from Thollamur, dear
Don't you remember me?
I saw you as a baby
You've grown up so much
- You are...?
- Aiyo!
You are Dharma anna's wife?
I couldn't recognise you
that day in the hospital, dear
We've come to invite you
for the wedding
'Brought betel nut
and the whole works'
Please come inside
Move...move aside
Sunstroke!
It's raining, how can you say sunstroke?
Hey! I'm a 'Thalapathy' fan
I won't lie
Lift him, size of a 'bhajji' and
hitting on the fritter aunty!
- Please sit down
- How's Dharma anna?
I saw him as a baby
Always in his birthday suit!
He's fine
He has gone out now
Wait, I'll call him
Don't trouble yourself
I just spoke to him
He has gone to a temple
for some redemption
Yes
I invited Thollamur uncle and
Rajavel uncle this side of town
Then I invited our brothers-in-law
Shekar and Murugadas in Senji
Whether Dharma anna
was at home or not
I wanted to invite you personally
and then head back home
How has your hair suddenly turned grey?
This is only original
That was dye!
- Hello?
- 'Hello?'
'Come to Koovathur immediately, bro'
Koovathur? Why?
'Urgent meeting it seems'
'Whoever doesn't turn up will be
eliminated from the party, come soon'
How are you related to him?
- Thollamur uncle, dear
- That's you
- 'Yes, right?'
- I asked about you
Uncle's brother-in-law
But he doesn't have any relatives
I'm related to you, not that uncle
Related to me?
Last I saw was at your wedding
- Whom did you see?
- Someone!
Why do you keep prodding?
You are just like your father
Always doubting your relatives!
That's alright, but why is it
both of you are sweating so much?
I can ask you the same question
I am pregnant
My face is unpleasant!
Nothing of that sort, dear
They are both diabetic
Can they go for a walk right here?
'Doctor has told us to walk in the rain'
- Go...go
- Get up
Is Dharma diabetic?
- Sugar level has decreased
- I should walk regularly too
Who is that?
Water level is rising
in the rains, madam
'Have you kept your valuables safe?'
Only at such times
'...thieves will be on the prowl'
Everything is under lock and key?
Yes
- Locked?
- Yes, of course
Take care, madam
'Even if we are confident
we have locked our house'
'Have you locked it?'
'If someone asks you'
1 minute
I'll be with you
1 minute is enough to flick it
Stuff it into our bag-
By the way who is getting married?
- Their daughter
- His daughter!
Correct, for my daughter
He treats my daughter like his own
Sometimes my wife tells
my daughter 'he is your father'
Imagine how close their bond is
- You have a daughter
- Just born
Smells like a gas leak from your stove?
'Yes, you're right'
Your nose is blocked
Stove may explode
Better check, you are
Dharmaraj's one and only wife
What are you doing?
Nothin-
- Don't call
- Let's go
Don't call
Nikitha, you go
- Hey!
- No
I'm telling you, go
Please, madam
Listen to our story
- Don't come near me
- I'll fall at your feet
- Don't call anyone
- No
Kindly let me speak
Listen...my dear!
Sir!
Look here
You can't use your phone here
Orders from our boss
My wife is all alone at home
Looks like she's in some trouble
- I must talk to her, give it!
- No, sir, sorry
- I'll leave then
- Sir
Our orders, sir
You can't go outside
I haven't had a baby for 20 years
My wife has conceived now
If something untoward happens to her
I will kill all of you, move aside
- Don't call
- Hear us out
- Akka, listen
- Give this
Keep it
Don't call anyone
We are leaving
- Let's go
- Wait, 1 minute
Akka, the other day
you said 'believe in God'
'He will never let us down'
God gave me that Dhokra statuette, akka
My family is dependent on this
It belongs to me
You know-
No, I don't know all that
You discuss his problem with him
- I don't know all that
- I swear, 1 track mind!
I'll call him, wait
I told you we are leaving
- Let's go
- Wait, da
Won't you narrate
a bedtime story to your baby?
Tell your child then
16 years ago was a man
Your father made him slip into coma
When he wanted to lead a normal life
your father stole what was rightfully his
Tell your child 'Only then you were born
God will protect you always'
- Banu
- Listen, dear
Don't, we are leaving now
Banu...!
Banu...Banu!
Let's scoot
Where are you going?
- Can't leave her-
- Only she knows we came
If she recovers
Dharmaraj will dice us to bits
Listen to me
Let's escape
' Don't stand there'
'Come right now'
Admit me in hospital please
Watchman!
Can't reach anyone
Why are you stopping?
Hurry up...let's go
Only thing we have left is
humanitarian concern
Let us not kill that too
You are the father of 2 boys too
Those fancy cabs
Call Ola or Uber, whatever
'Continuous downpour in Chennai
for the past 3 days'
'Power outage, no ATM,
mobile network or internet'
'At her age she won't have the strength
to carry her baby full term'
'You must take utmost precautions'
'Reason I keep insisting'
She has no chance to conceive again
Can't get a cab in Uber or Ola
No signal at all
Total network failure
What the hell-
Get lost!
Stop...anna
What, sir?
Take me to the hospital urgently
Heavy rain, sir
Road is blocked over there
Knee deep water
Auto can't ply in that area
Delivery case, bro
'Wait, akka'
I'll try my best
Bring her, sir
Thanks, bro
- You go, I'll manage
- Take care
Please bear the pain, madam
We are almost there
- Sir, isn't she MLA's wife?
- Yes, bro
Hey! Drive slowly
- What happened?
- Auto is stuck, not starting
I can't bear the pain
'If someone cries in front of us
or confides their worries'
'...they are not expecting us to solve it'
'Won't someone hold our hands and say'
'I'm there for you
Don't be scared'
'These are the only words
of comfort they expect'
Listen to me
Look at me
I'm here for you
You'll be fine
Trust me
I'll admit you in a hospital
"Tamil has taught us to be
compassionate to humanity"
Come on...careful
Hold him
Watch your step
Boss, hand her over to us
She will be fine
Don't worry, boss
I'm there for her
"Sole soul friend"
Let me take her to safety
"Buddy, comrade, cousin, best friend
You and I will be 'we' till the very end"
"Friend, classmate, roommate, well-wisher"
"You and I will become 'we' forever"
"Thamizh has taught us to be
compassionate to humanity"
"Enough of caste and religion
splitting lives and love in every region"
"Humaneness is the only solution"
"Enough of losing lives in bloodshed
Enough of ties broken in hatred"
"Love bonds widespread"
I'll manage, my house is nearby
"If years as tears dissolve and run
in front of our eyes in unison"
"Even if the world loses faith in the sun"
"Co-worker, confidante, crony, companion"
"Dawn will light up the sky one day
Night will vanish into his hideaway"
Brother, how much?
Then, now and always,
no charge for pregnant women
See you
Brother, what's your name?
Joseph
"Enough of caste and religion
splitting lives and love in every region"
"Humanitarianism is the only solution"
Bro...bro
- Calling me?
- Yes, bro
What?
Your wife has been
taken to Global hospital
Global Hospital?
"If years as tears dissolve and run
in front of our eyes in unison"
"Even if the world loses faith in the sun"
"Buddy, close associate"
"Childhood friend, classmate"
"Dawn will light up the sky one day
Night will vanish into his hideaway"
"Till that day dawns, dear people
with love you'll serve and fulfill"
"Achieve and accomplish
Relish and cherish"
Who brought you here, dear?
I don't know
I was screaming in pain
God sent me someone from the road
The pain was unbearable
He said, 'I'm there for you'
Nothing else
If he hadn't come at that moment
I swear we would've lost our baby
Only God saved me
"If years as tears dissolve and run
in front of our eyes in unison"
"Even if the world loses faith in the sun"
Keep the statuette safe-
You admitted the patient
You're walking away
without paying the bill
Thank you very much

we join forces hand in hand'

play no part in this unity'
'But should we unite
only when we face a problem?'
'We can always embrace solidarity'

we should always ensure doesn't change'
