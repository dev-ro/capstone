Listen to me carefully,
never bend so much...
...for a woman that she
tramples all over you.
Someone's with him.
What was that big commotion
at your house, today?
Were you scolding your
uncle or was he...?
We had a fight.
- Why?
He wants me to get married.
Which one am I? Am I your
42nd or 42 and a half?
Pack your bags and move in with me.
Where will I stay?
In Tara and Joe's room
or aunt Leela's room?
In my room.
- Before marriage?
He stopped.
Meera, please, listen to me.
Let's go.
Stop!
I need a lift, please
follow that taXi.
Please, boss, hurry up!
Sleep with them, screw them...
...but never live with them.
For shots, why try to own the bar?
Quickly, please, my
love story may end.
RelaX. I'll get you there.
Hey, wait! Meera!
What is he doing?
Come on follow him.
Can't live with them. Can't
live without them.
I can't understand a
word you are saying.
Aren't you scared?
I Want to hold your hand
and see the Niagra Falls
We'll have two daughters,
Just like you.
Tonsure their heads in Pittsburg
BalaJi Temple.
Tell me one thing, should
I overtake or follow?
Overtake them!
Since, how many days do you know?
We've hardly met, and you
talk of kids already?
I love you...
- So what can I do?
Tell me should I keep
her or dump her.
Bastard is making us run.
Think about it.
Stop!
- Want to get us killed? - Stop!
Finished.
Your bail order has arrived.
Come, sir is calling you.
This way!
Your clothes, ring and
chain. Check it.
And this is your Rs. 40.75.
- 25 paise is less.
What Jailor!
Living with thieves like us you have
lost your sense of humour?
Yes! And this Rs. 180/-
for the chair frame you made.
Keep it!
Get a new bucket for ward B.
Arse gets dry before the
bucket gets filled.
I'll leave...?
- Sign here, take this.
Free air. Take a deep breath. EnJoy!
Same air inside only it was
miXed with prisoners' farts.
How's everything? - Fine!
C'mon sit! Let's go!
Bastard! Stop fooling around.
Bengal chicks are like
spicy mutton...
Lallan, you know
Gopal bailed you out?
There's something in
the Hoogly water.
He has called you at his home.
- First I need to settle something.
You're making the same mistake
again and again...
How long are you going to suffer?
She wont come.
Are you listening?
Stop this or I call the police...
Can't follow Hindi?
Shall I use Bengali?
You dumb green shirt, shut up!
This is my family matter...
...or I'll miX some red in your
green and it'll turn yellow
Try to understand.
Do you understand this pain?
Or shall I break your arm?
Your father will never look at
you again if you go with him.
Spare me! - Shut up!
Come out, Sashi...
She'll not come.
Leave her! Shashi, get in! Go!
I'll never see your face...
Stop it. Goddess Durga is going
outside... - She knows everything...
You know nothing...
Stop cutting your teeth in me.
- Teeth can't be cut.
I Want to tell you something.
- Tell me...
Listen Dad has arranged a Job
for you. Will you do it?
I will.
- First promise me.
Leave my hand. - Promise?
- I swear on you.
You're NilanJan's son-in-law?
He's my father-in-law.
But that makes you
his son in law no?
Hey check that.
What's my Job?
- To stand at the gate...
Reams of paper come
from the docks...
Papers must come in
with a gate pass.
You mean authorization?
Without a gate pass nothing
moves in or out.
My salary?
- Rs.2000/ - per month.
Rs.10/-per hour overtime.
After siX months, Salary
may increase.
What is the total value
of these machines?
What?
I need to protect them no?
I must know their value.
Your Job is at the door. I'll
take care of the rest.
Not asking for your Job.
That machine alone costs 2 crores.
Rest, you can estimate.
If something gets stolen
when I am off duty...
What is this nonsense?
Not nonsense. Just imagine that
your press catches fire...
Who will try to burn this place?
- Whoever, say the fire god...
Why him, even I could do it?
Sir, it's me, Sheshadri!
NilanJan's man is
not a straight guy.
He talks too much...
I'll tell him...
Take this.
Hello! Yes, sir...
No, you listen to
me first. You'll pay me Rs. 2000/...
...to take care of machines
worth crores. Is that fair?
Listen! We are already doing a
favor by giving you this Job.
And now you are teaching us.
You are right! If something happens
tomorrow, don't blame me.
Threatening me?
- I'm not threatening you.
Just saying I can guarantee
their safety.
Take care of me. I'll take
care of your press.
If not it's O.K. May evil eyes
be warded off your press.
Call him to my office.
Meenakshi, you're wanted inside.
Come, come.
You promised.
What?
- That you'll take up a Job.
He was giving you a Job only
because you're my son-in-law.
And you tried to eXtort from him?
Seen that property?
EXpects me to guard property
worth 2 crores for Rs.2000/-
No way! Lallan Singh doesn't
come so cheap.
Whose turn is it? - Then
you'll eXtort money.
Tell him, Ravi! - I...
You lied. Said you will
give up rowdism.
This is not rowdism, darling.
Gopal is here.
You're not going. - How can
I if she doesn't want me to?
Stop Joking. He's waiting
for you. He's very angry.
Hoodibaaba!
Tell him, Lallan. Won't come.
He doesn't want to become
a thug like Gopal.
What's the Job?
- You're not going.
Important work.
- What's in it for me? - Lots.
I'm saying no.
- So don't say it for a while...
You're not going anywhere.
I won't let you.
Go away Ghoshal. Lallan's
not coming.
Who bailed you out?
I'll go now...
- Sit.
Know the trouble I went
to to bail you out?
You didn't do it because
of any affection for me.
Someone must have got you by the
balls you remembered me.
Why? Isn't it.
Is this the way to talk
to your elder brother.
Is he is my brother? While running
away to Kolkatta, this brother of
...mine abandoned me with a
piece of bread in my hand.
It took me ten years to find him.
He calls himself my big brother.
Sit big brother...
- I'm not here to sit...
You want to lie down?
Shall I put a cot?
Do you wish to become something
in life or keep playing cards?
But I'm playing...
Panchayat Elections are approaching.
Ten days left to file
the nominations.
So? Want me to reduce four days?
We won't let anyone contest.
But some college kids are
instigating the villagers.
You need to get crowds
for the rallies.
Take them in lorries
give them 50 rupees...
...and a packet of Biryani.
Ascertain there is no problem.
Their leader Michael,
BarthwaJ, Trilok.
And many more boys are there.
Want to hit them or kill them?
Lallan is not going
to do any of these.
Lallan tell them to leave.
A woman is wearing the
'langot' in this house.
Get out. Lallan won't go.
Don't interrupt.
Lallan, do one thing, wear a sari.
I'll gift you the petticoat.
You'll not indulge in rowdyism.
I told you not to butt in.
I won't allow you to go.
I'll die before I let you go.
Shut up!
Are you threatening me?
I'm pleading with you.
Just a minute! I can't
bear such scenes.
See me after you're done with her.
I'm going. Let's go, Vishal.
Don't go to him.
She's telling you for your good.
This is why I obJected.
He's a beast.
I shouldn't have come.
I'm leaving.
- So go.
Go and never return back to me.
I won't die without you.
Because I had the balls I'm
alive and kicking today.
Screw your dream world.
All that I own I've
snatched or stolen.
Got beaten, gone to Jail.
I don't need anyone.
A tenth class pass and thinks
she's a great lady.
Come to change me.
You'll die a dog's death.
Crows will feast on you.
Come... get up.
What is it? Where's Sashi? - Why...?
Where's Sashi...?
- Leave him alone...
He's such a scoundrel.
Beats his pregnant wife in
the middle of the street.
Leave it. This is common
with married couples.
Don't interfere. Shut up.
How can a husband beat
...his wife so brutally?
Today he beats her, Tomorrow you'll
beat me. That's why you support him.
Why are you saying so?
- All men are the same.
Women are no less.
Why didn't you tell me?
Which month?
- Third.
Who's the father? Just Joking.
C'mon, smile.
I want a daughter like you.
Cat eyes, teeth.
'Bitter at times or sweet as honey.'
'Soft at times or rugged.'
...'is my lovable man! '
'His love lorn looks
pierce my heart.'
'My heart blushes with coy.'
'Your recluse heart is
imprisoned within me.'
'Oh! God may my husband's name
and fame live forever.'
'Lf his honour is at stake'...
...'I'll die in shame.'
'Coyish blush makes the
pink face glossy.'
IntoXicates me.'
'Curls of hair bloom in the air.'
'Celestial Gods witness our love.'
'I will die in shame.'
Come, come. Pining away for us?
My hands are itching
Come... come.
Is everything ready? - Ready.
Cold drinks, mineral water And
biscuits. - Put it in our account.
No more credit. - Who are you?
His grandpa!
- What's this hooliganism?
Hello sir? There's a riot here.
Kids from Presidency College.
Come quickly.
Tell me! Why ignore your studies
and enter gutters of politics?
Gopal dada is pissed off with you.
Study. Give eXams. Become a big man.
Why politics?
Which hand do you write with?
Tell me! Move it.
Brothers have arrived.
Why us? What have we done?
Lallan speaking. Hear me?
Stalwarts like Tagore, RaJaram
Mohan Roy, Subhash Chandra Bose...
...attained enlightenment in Bengal.
From all over India, people
came to Kolkatta.
From Sharad Chandra
to SatyaJit Ray...
...from Saurav Ganguly
to Sushmita Sen...
...all have done Bengal proud.
But even then Bengal is ignored
by the rest of the states.
Only because we're not
ruling at the Centre...
Bengalis are unique.
This is great!
Hail Bangla!
Long live, SanJeet Babu!
C'mon clap!
Who is Lallan?
Hey, Lallan, come here!
He's my brother!
He did all these arrangements.
- Bring him with you.
Do you dislike me or my party?
Tell me honestly.
What happened? Did he do something
wrong? What did you do?
Let me brief you, what does
he do out side the college.
See? How did he react?
He bashed up students
outside that college.
You didn't spare even the girls.
Am I right? - Yes!
Who told you to beat them?
Are you mad?
Not only this, there's more.
He met the Inspector,
...used my name got
the boys arrested.
All sons of V.I. Ps.
You are out of your mind.
Are you crazy?
All this is my fault. Shouldn't
have bailed out the beast.
Finished? Now let me talk.
- Shut up.
Didn't your rally happen smoothly?
- Shut up.
Didn't the students cock up in fear?
Didn't see a single damn black flag.
What did I tell you? - What? - To
take care if there's any trouble.
Did anything happen? - Then what
was the need to bash them?
It is because I bashed
them they kept mum.
If I hadn't then there would
have been a commotion...
...and you would've
been left holding it.
Who will answer the opposition
at the assembly? You?
Sure. Tomorrow when I get
to the assembly like you, I will.
Let's see if anyone has the
balls to question after that.
You'll survive. I like him.
Take care of him.
Does Gopal take good care of you?
Give him a share in your
neXt L.P. G Licence.
When I was his age, I
was eXactly like this.
No more hooliganism. I'll
become a businessman now.
I'll be a well-dressed business man.
What business? Bashing people?
Why are you giggling?
- It is a laughing matter...
You wait!
He's lost it.
What happened? Snake
got your tongues?
Where's Gopal? What happened?
What happened?
Yes, brother! No. Lallan speaking.
No physical inJuries
a little shaken up.
Can't tell if his brain's working.
He'll be on holiday for a while.
He's not capable of much right
now. I'll take care.
Who? Michael? I know. Done.
Ok... I'll keep the phone.
Thought of a name for the baby?
- What a time to ask.
Think hard and give it
a good one. Understood?
How does Dumbo sound?
- I'll break your teeth.
My son will not be like me.
- But you wanted a girl.
Whatever. It's your duty
to bring it up well.
He shouldn't roam the streets
like a dog like me.
He'll be born a prince
and live like a king.
Never scold him.
Not even if he cries
the whole night...
...keeps you awake wets the bed
- No!
If he shits on you, then?
Where are you going?
- Delhi. To meet the Prime Minister
Coming?
Dumbo! Dumbo Ram!
Dumbo Singh, sounds good.
What is this?
- What?
Where did you get this?
Who gave it to you?
Give it. It doesn't look
good in your hands.
Big, big eyes, Sari, a gun,
you look scary.
What is it doing in the flour can?
Stop fooling around. It will go off.
Is this your gas agency business?
You won't understand. Give it to me.
Why did you bring this here?
What'll you do by knowing this?
- I want to know.
Don't play bandit queen (Phoolan).
- Did Gopal give it to you?
Now he wants you to murder. This
was the only thing left to do
Are you giving it to me or shall
I slap you and take it?
I won't. I'll die before
I give it to you.
I'll not allow you to kill anyone.
Another scene, like this
and I'll bury you alive.
I'll do whatever I want.
No one can stop me.
Listen to me carefully.
Never bend so much for a woman
that she tramples all over you.
There's someone with him.
Are you sure he's our guy?
Useless females. They are bad news...
...especially the educated ones.
Neither are they happy nor
do they let us be happy.
He's stopping.
What' is he doing?
Follow him, stay right.
Sleep with them, screw them
but never live with them.
For shots, why try to own the bar?
The bugger is turning around.
Tell me. Should I live with
Sashi or leave her?
Keep an eye outside. There's
a Police van behind.
But they are an addiction.
Can't live with them. Can't
live without them.
What are you blabbering? I
can't understand a word.
Are you scared.
Yeah, if I think about
it. So I don't.
Tell me one thing, should
I overtake or follow him?
Overtake.
You didn't answer. Should
I keep her or leave her.
Bastard. He is getting away.
- Alright. Think and tell me.
The man in the white shirt in
the middle, who's eating Pizza.
Close all eXits.
I am scared.
- Don't panic. Just guard my back.
I should have gone to the eXit.
Badal... Aren't you PrasanJeet's
nephew?
So you think you can come to the
hostel and beat up the students?
Uncle said that College students are
not wanted in a Panchayat election.
Tell your uncle that for
so many years he has...
...brought his politics
into the college
Now students will enter politics...
...and we'll also break
hands and legs.
You hit one of us, we will
hit, five of yours.
Happy? You could have
lost your eyesight.
It is unlucky to see
in a mirror at night.
A shot of A.T. S and Penicillin
and I'll be totally ok.
Let him eat. He hasn't
eaten in two days.
Glve me that curry. Did you make it?
I've waited everyday for
your father for years.
Didn't know if he would come
home alive, hurt or dead.
I thought all that had ended.
Don't talk ill of dad, mom.
He worked for the society.
But he did nothing for his home.
It's your cooking, that's
made us all this way.
How many more sleepless nights
do I have to spend...
...worrying whether I have to go to
a police station or a hospital?
How many more times are you
going to ask me the same question?
But it has had no effect on you.
You won't let me rest in
peace even in my old age.
Don't blackmail me. Nothing's
wrong with you.
A shot of insulin, a
sugar free diet...
...and you'll live for years.
You should be proud of him.
Five more people like him...
...and Kolkatta would've
been perfect.
I don't want a hero. I want
a normal son like the others.
Social service, patriotism have
all ended with your father.
Not ended, Just started.
Hey! What are you doing here?
Came to receive a Physics Professor.
How's your mom? Giving
her insulin regularly?
Yes. Just gave her a shot
of units of human miXture.
She should avoid chocolates.
That's her only problem.
He keeps advising the world,
but hogs Sandesh and boozes.
The other day I found cigarettes
under his pillow.
Why talk about all that here?
Aunty! - My child, come here!
Mike, come here.
Remember Radhika?
She's back after completing her M.A.
Last time I met you,
you had braces...
Now they're gone.
- I can see that. Bye.
Why were you so rude to him?
I wasn't. Are you still
stitching him up?
Atleast twice a month.
You keep quiet! Do you know
what he puts Leela through?
Where am I denying that? Can
I ever argue with you?
Your aunt rules at home.
I've no value there.
You are number one, T.V. Comes
second, dog is third and I...
I've forgotten my watch.
I'll be right back.
Come soon.
Did you miss me?
I missed you a lot.
I must go. Shall I?
Go.
Tomorrow. 4 P.M.
I knew this would happen.
Good. We needn't take
the Physics eXam.
Continue this way and
you'll be rusticated.
Instead of studying you'll
are into politics?
Idealism will get you nowhere.
You'll lose terribly.
Your parents struggle to educate
you. And you'll...
Study. Become somebody. The world
will take care of itself.
When you were in college, you
must've studied very hard.
Has the world become any better
I'm being frank.
We wouldn't say anything bad to
you. You are Madhumita's mom.
How's she?
You've been suspended and
you think it's funny.
What are you going to do now?
All the things you've
suspended us for.
There could be more in the car.
There's no one.
He's the one, take him.
What is it?
Go back.
Can't you see how many
people are here.
Go quietly and they two?
We searched the entire home.
But no one is here.
Where they gone.
I don't understand.
Why is V.O.U.S. Pronounced Voo.
I'm the Professor, not
you...
Pronounce as I tell you...
Where are you taking me? - Come!
Where are we going?
- To Parganas.
Where?
- A small village.
You've studied economics
and political theory.
Now learn to apply it.
This is what I like about you...
...you barge into my class,
drag me away...
...and instead of taking me to
a cinema hall or Victoria...
...you take me to some village.
Give me your hand.
You teach French right?
Why don't you show me
what a French kiss is?
They want to scare you.
Every election, they win more than
seats without even contesting.
If you want to save yourselves
you have to fight against them.
You all are there with us.
We are not worried.
Today we're there. Who
knows about tomorrow
We will finish studying and
go to Dubai or London...
...or America to work.
Then what'll you do?
Tell us what to do.
You have to stay here not me.
This is your village,
your land, your fields.
So you tell me, what you'll do.
- You go wherever you want.
We'll work out something.
What is that something?
He says we should put
up a new person.
...in Boloida's place in
the councillor election.
Why not?
There are so many of you. Who
has the guts to contest?
Talk practically.
We can't do all this.
- Why?
We put up a person to
contest the election.
He disappeared overnight.
Never returned.
How many can disappear?
If two disappear then bring
then third, then the fourth.
All of you stand together.
Then what can they do?
Demand your rightful share of
water, electricity and food.
Heard that?
- Talks a lot.
If someone gets pissed off,
they'll cut his tongue.
I've read his palm. He
has a long lifeline.
Who is ready to contest
the election?
You've slogged and educated me.
Take up one more challenge.
Just as you've lived proudly
make this village stand proud.
You can do it. You can
stand in election.
How is it possible?
If anyone can do this, it's you.
Say yes, you can do it.
My sister will contest.
Do you realise. What he's saying?
You don't need all this.
You shut up. You are spineless.
Won't all of you support her?
We will make her win.
Why these formalities?
This is my college and
they're my students.
Professor Wienberg from America
has invited Michael...
...to do research there.
He is a Nobel Laureate.
Being invited by him is a big thing.
What's his name?
I'm PrasanJeet Bhattacharya.
I know.
The Principal tells me
that you're the first...
Many have got it earlier too.
- But I didn't know that.
I'm very proud of you.
Tell me, what do you want?
Should I talk directly with
the Chief Minister?
I will help in every way.
Don't hesitate to ask me.
Treat me as your elder brother.
Can I address you as my brother?
Sure. Why not?
I don't want this American
Scholarship.
Why?
- I wish to stay here.
What will you do staying here?
So, you're not going?
Look, this is a lifetime
opportunity.
You should grab it.
Leave politics to us.
We fight, then make up.
We survive by hook or crook.
You're the strength of West
Bengal, precious to us.
- That's why I want to stay here.
But why politics, my brother?
You've toiled so hard...
...and taken the country
from where to where.
Don't you think I should share
that responsibility?
After all, I'm your younger brother.
But if everyone starts
thinking like you...
...no one will need me.
Look, there are very few
good men in politics.
I know.
Alright, take care of yourself.
You're there, my elder
brother. Isn't it?
That's right, where will I go?
Let's go.
PrasenJit is not only a Minister...
...he's the correspondent
of our College.
What happened? He was talking
happily, smiling.
Only thing missing was a hug.
Call Trilok?
He's in Room No. 42.
- No he's in Vishnu's room.
Tell him his uncle has come.
- Alright, I'll go.
Want to fight elections?
C'mon tell me!
Who did this?
- I'll be alright.
They were Gopal's men.
Who is it?
Who are you?
- Let me see them.
How dare you barge in?
Get out all of you.
Look, I'm asking you all to get out.
I'm asking you to stop.
We can come to a compromise.
We will sit and talk.
Things can be set right.
Why don't you understand?
I have a wife and a
four year old child.
It's not fair to barge
in like this.
What's my mistake? Please tell me.
This is the last warning.
Is the Inspector inside?
Want to file an F.I.R.
Want to file an
F.I.R. Give me a pen.
Gopal Singh's house
has been attacked.
Do you know who did it?
- Yes.
We did it.
- You all?
Yes... write down the names.
You are not writing?
Is the list too long?
Isn't the lock-up room
too small? No problem.
It's okay!
I can't understand a word.
I could never understand.
Remember how you cleared
your Science paper?
Agreed, this is blackmail.
A doctor shouldn't be doing this.
But this is Just a small favour.
I've known these boys
since childhood.
They are from educated families.
They have been in Jail
since two days.
Yes ok allright.
It's over.
- Can we go? - Yes... go!
Hey! What is this?
- Aero Physics. Goes over our heads
Can I get a cigarette?
I'll take it...
- Get going...
There's only one and I'm taking it...
What have you done? Now,
how can I go out?
You look seXy. - Will you
keep quiet if I tear yours?
Please wait.
It's not what you are thinking.
How do you know, what I am thinking?
Whatever you're thinking
it's not that.
Tell me, what was I thinking
about? Is this what your uncle...
...and aunty taught you?
Why do women always think
ill of other women?
Would you believe me if I said that
your wild son tore my blouse?
Straighten it and leave.
Don't come back.
You think I will ever come back?
Even if you fall at my feet, I wont.
I pity your daughter-in-law.
Get out. Arguing with
me in my house?
Are both of you aware of all this?
- No! - No, mother!
Lies. Full of lies.
Kanta Devi has won.
For the first time a lady
has won in our village.
I've won only because of you.
Otherwise the election would
have never been fair.
Give me your hand.
What was that big commotion?
Were you scolding your
uncle or was he?
We had a fight.
- Why?
He wanted me to marry some
idiot whom I don't want to.
And the idiot I want to marry
doesn't want to marry at all.
Pack your bags and move
in with me. In my room.
Where will I stay?
In Tara and Joe's room
or aunt Leela's room?
In my room.
Before marriage?
- Why not?
It's a sin.
If it's a sin to live together, then
it's also a sin to fall in love.
Love is divine.
- There is no such thing as love.
We are all born, we meaning,
you, me, the red shirt...
...yellow dress, everyone
to procreate.
Flirting, roaming on beaches...
...laughing and crying
come to an end...
...in a park or in a hotel bed.
Love is nothing but hormones.
It's pure organic chemistry.
That's it!
Understand?
- Not a thing.
It's very simple. I love you.
Come live with me if you
can put up with my ways.
I'll think about it.
'The clouds came. They
build up the heat.'
'They showered rain.'
'By their will.'
'The path that comes, it also goes.'
'Lt may turn somewhere.'
'By their will.'
'Listen! Listen to this story.'
'Think about it, my friend.'
'The stones that break way.'
'You'll find them in these paths.'
'This is not a thread.'
'Which can't be tied up.'
'The world is like a dream,
think this as a sign.'
'These are the sounds of the hearts
which can only be heard here.'
Today's our 113th day.
