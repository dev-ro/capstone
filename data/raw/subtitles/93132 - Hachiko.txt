December, 1923
Odate Town Akita Prefecture
I'm Kakita from the
agricuIturaI engineering section
It's some bIizzard
How's it going?
It'II probabIy take tiII morning
Let's go and see
They are borned yet?
- Thanks
- Make yourseIf comfortabIe
The maIe is purebred from
Onoda Gorozaemon's pIace
It'II be a fine Iitter
Our chief engineer, Mr. Mase,
was asked by his mentor
Professor Ueno Hidejiro of Tokyo
To find him an Akita puppy
When Aka was born
We had a snowstorm
for three days and nights
We aImost thought
our house wouId coIIapse
They are borned
< HACHI-KO MONOGATARI >
When you suddenIy yeIIed out,
''They are born''
I thought your wife had given birth
I've aIready got five kids
I couIdn't handIe another one
Here's the house
Professor Ueno is one of our country's
Top agricuIturaI engineers
And he's very fond of dogs
When I visited him Iast year,
he had just Iost his dog
A femaIe Akita...
not a purebred though
PIease come
He mentioned then that he
wanted a purebred next time
He'II be ovetjoyed
I'II notify him right away
May I use the phone?
Right here
I'd Iike Tokyo pIease
Tokyo, Aoyama... number is 2007
Coming
His daughter is another dog Iover
It's a Mr. Mase from the
Akita prefecturaI office
HeIIo, this is Chizuko
My parents are in Hakone
at Tonosawa Hot Springs
They go there every year
I'II be happy to take a message
Yes?
A dog?
An Akita?
You're giving it to us?
That's wonderfuI
It was born this morning
A fine Iooking pup
Today is December 16th
So after the new year...
Yes. I'II caII my father right away
Thank you so much
We're going to get an Akita puppy
A dog, again?
What do you mean ''again''?
It's a purebred Akita
I must caII Father.
What's the number in Hakone?
Look, a singing frog
WeIcome back
Your daughter is on the Iine
ReaIIy?
ShaII I put the caII
through to your room?
Thank
A man from the Akita prefecturaI office
...what was his name?
Mase
Right Mr. Mase caIIed
A beautifuI Akita puppy
was born this morning
He said that you had asked for one
Not reaIIy...
But Mase was there when Gonsuke died
He said he'd send me an Akita
So I just asked him to keep us in mind
No more dogs
Yes, weII...
it was a sad-time when Gonsuke died
Even you cried
So Iet's not get another dog
It's too Iate to refuse
Mr. Mase reaIIy wants us to have it
If you don't want it,
I'II take care of it
I've aIways wanted a purebred Akita
She says that, but I'm the one
who'II have to take care of it
Even when she found Gonsuke
in front of the train station
I had to do everything
And I hate dogs
I hate cats AND dogs
You promised me when Gonsuke died that
We wouIdn't have any more dogs
But Chizuko insists
WeII, I'm opposed to it
It's a purebred this time
Purebred or mixed
I don't want to go through
that sadness again
Chizuko says she'II take care of it
Look, it's snowing
Stay heaIthy now
I hope they Iike him
Take care
I'm going out.
Don't forget to pick up the dog
- I pick up the dog.
- Yes
What's going on?
I intended to go to the station with you
But I changed my mind an hour ago
I'm going to a concert at HibIya Park
Excuse me
It's Tsumoru
I'II be right down
I...
I'm sorry
That's an idea
She's aIways so fickIe
Kiku
He's not here
Where is he? It's urgent
Oops Sorry
Hey, don't break it, wiII you?
I'm right here
Kiku...
What's the big rush?
There's a dog arriving at 3P.M.
at Shibuya Station
Another one besides Gonsuke?
Gonsuke died Iast year
He did?
You're right...
I took him to the crematory myseIf
If it's from Akita,
it must be an Akita breed
With a taiI that curIs tight
Sorry to interrupt
I'm against having a dog
But Miss Chizuko Ioves them
PeopIe who Iove animaIs are kind
You hate dogs because
It's aIways your duty
to cIean the doghouse
Miss Chizuko is so mean
She was supposed to go
to the station with me
But suddenIy, she changed
her mind to go to a concert
That feIIow... her fiance came
NaturaIIy She'd prefer him to a dog
WiII you go to the station with me?
Go aIone
I'm afraid of dogs
That face of yours wouId scare dogs more
I'II bet you're afraid of dogs too
Come off it At Ieast a dog
is better than a cat
Feed a dog for three days
and it'II be IoyaI for Iife
But you can feed a cat for three years
And it stiII won't care a whit
Saikichi, Iet's go
There's a box... where was it from?
Odate
It's from Odate... a dog
The dog?
Here you are
Your seaI, pIease
I don't have it with me
Look This is for Ueno Hidejiro
Don't you know Professor Ueno?
I do, but...
WeII, you shouId
He's a famous agricuIturaI engineer
I'II get the seaI, Kiku
Never mind
Recognize my face?
No
What kind of cIerk are you?
Kiku of Inarizaka is pretty
weII known in this area
Remember that, bIockhead
- Now do you stiII need my seaI?
- Yes
Your head's fuII of Iead
Like the raiIroad tracks
Your thumbprint wiII do
Why didn't you say so from the start
It's dead
Hey The raiIway company
wiII pay for this
What's the matter?
The dog they sent from Akita is dead
The raiIway company's to bIame
Is it reaIIy dead?
And I'm not taking a dead dog
When Iive animaIs are transported
The raiIway company
is not responsibIe if it dies
WeIcome home
What about the dog?
SaiIichi went to pick it up
Didn't Chizuko go?
She went to a concert with Mr. MorIyama
Such a bad omen
at the start of a new year
Another dog's funeraI
Bound to happen...
after riding a shaky train for two days
Thanks, Kiku
Hey Prof...
The pup's dead
What's the matter, pup?
Get some miIk
Poor IittIe thing
I guess the journey was too Iong
That's why I was against this
It's dead, Prof...
It's aIive
It's drinking
I'm home
You're home?
Is the puppy here?
The puppy's here
- You've been back?
- I am back.
Is the puppy here?
WeIcome home
I'II go and see it
WeIcome
You traveIed so far
Good boy
Father...
You'II be responsibIe for the puppy
It's not about the puppy
What is it?
About Tsumoru...
I hear you went to
a concert with him today
He has something to discuss with you
I know what he wants
He wants me to get
another friend into coIIege
But I don't beIieve
in backdoor admissions
It's not about that
What then?
I'm free this coming Sunday
It has to be tonight
Tonight?
Yes
AII right
Where is he?
Outside
Outside?
He's waiting outside
How rude
Why didn't you teII us?
ShaII I caII him?
Of course
PIease sit
Has he eaten?
He doesn't want any
Why didn't you show him in?
It was very thoughtIess of you
Yes?
Yes
Go on
Yes
I'm Iistening
WeII...
Yes?
Chizuko is with chiId
And... I'm responsibIe
Are you angry?
WeII, after hearing whose chiId it is
My bIood pressure has gone down
And so...
I'd Iike to ask for her hand in marriage
I see. Thank you
Under the circumstances
I think it's best to have
the ceremony right away
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
How's the dog?
You're Iooking heaIthy
You don't have a name yet
PIease don't choose a name
Iike Gonsuke again
But you can't go nameIess
Let's see...
your foreIegs are firmIy grounded
Just Iike the character
for number eight
So we'II name you Hachi as in 8
Like it, Hachi?
We just got an Akita dog.
WiII you take it in?
Not for me
You're born in the year of the monkey?
No, the boar
A former student now
at the Akita prefecturaI office
Sent it to me
My daughter wanted to keep it
But she'II be getting married soon
She is your onIy daughter, isn't she?
Yes
I had hoped to adopt a son-in-Iaw
But her fiance is aIso an onIy chiId
So it won't work
They're getting married
in a bit of a hurry
On the 29th of this month
WiII you honor us by attending?
CertainIy
And you aIso
Ueno Chizuko
Do you take this man
To be your IawfuIIy wedded husband?
To have and to hoId
To Iove and to cherish
To honor and obey
In sickness and in heaIth
tiII death to you part?
I do
Chizuko didn't even shed a tear
I noticed your eyes were watery though
When she said good bye
from the train window
The sadness suddenIy hit me
That my IittIe girI was being taken away
Were they tears of bitterness then?
Tears of bitterness, joy, sadness...
aII at once
I guess they've checked
into the inn by now
It was their honeymoon
They couId've gone farther than Atami
Tsumoru wanted to save money
He's very stingy for his age
But to think she was pregnant
She'd have gotten pregnant
sooner or Iater
It was just sooner
I was quite shocked by the whoIe thing
What amazed me was the way she said
''I'm not taking the dog''
So bIuntIy, right before MorIyama
When she offered aII her Iove to MorIyama
I couIdn't heIp but stare at her
He was quite speechIess too,
so I guess it worked
Chizuko was onIy saying
what was in her heart
I wonder?
Of course
What wiII you do about Hachi?
Chizuko asked me to take care of it
I'm against it
You're pretty adamant
I'm not wiIIing to share your Iove either
Spin three times and bark
Spin three times
Spin and bark
Dumb dog
Ogata
Don't tease the dog
He's onIy a pup.
He doesn't know any tricks yet
Besides, I don't keep dogs
so they can perform tricks
Put yourseIf in the dog's pIace
Hachi is hungry Hurry and feed him
You've aIready eaten, haven't you?
Have a nice trip
Watch Hachi whiIe I'm away
How Iong wiII you be away?
They're cuItivating the area now
I want to check the progress
so about four or five days
Just as peopIe have rights,
canines have rights too
I'II respect Hachi's rights
Even if we're going to give him away
We must protect his rights
whiIe he's staying here
Have some tea, Sir
Hachi
No Hachi
SaiIichi
My poor fIowers
Hachi, if you want
your rights to be respected
Don't be so naughty
Babies have excess energy
They can't sit stiII
How oId is the IittIe one?
Three months
Imagine Becoming a father at his age
I'm sorry
How's Hachi?
He's doing weII
Hi Hachi
I hear you ruined your mistress's garden
WeIcome home
I think Hachi has grown
You've onIy been away five days
I see signs of inteIIigence in
those eyes of yours, Hachi
Do you understand me?
What wiII you do about him?
It' better to give him away
whiIe he's smaII
WeII Hachi?
Do you want to be our dog?
You want to stay?
AII right. I won't send you anywhere
Fine day, isn't it?
Such a cute dog
Go on, Hachi
Good day
Isn't it hot?
He's growing so fast
Have a nice day
Thank you, Hachi
Now go on home
Hachi
I hope you didn't chew on grass
WiII you go to the station
again this evening?
Gosh, it's so hot
Dear, Iook
Good boy
Waited for me, did you?
That's some dog
This is no good
Doesn't Iook Iike it'II stop
Wonder if the dog's here
He's waiting
Thank you
Good Hachi
Thank you for coming, Hachi.
Even in this snow
Father, happy new year
Happy new year
Happy new year
Same to you
Hasn't he grown big?
Here's your grandfather
Was it aII right to bring him
in this coId weather?
That's what I said
Come inside, Chizuko
Hasn't Hachi grown so big?
Catching fIeas suits you, Father
This is number 33
Let me carry him
Toru's gotten so heavy
He doesn't taIk yet
Of course not.
He's onIy three months oId
Has Professor been at it since morning?
It's Iike a research project with him
That's how he is
Once he gets started he can't stop
I think Father Ioves Hachi
more than his own grandson
Don't be siIIy
I heard Hachi accompanies him
to the station daiIy
Yes
And goes back at sundown to meet him
Hachi doesn't wear a watch,
but he knows the time
Go to sIeep
SIeep weII
ShaII we pIay some cards?
Cards, huh?
Better stiII, run a bath for me
How is the water?
Just fine, thank you
He amazes me
Does he bathe with Hachi aII the time?
AIways... after catching the fIeas
Better watch out, Mother
Or Hachi wiII take Father's Iove from you
Excuse me
You're good at it
Won't you join us?
No thank you
Hachi might catch coId,
so cIose the window
You're soaking wet
It's aII right now
I didn't even notice a storm brewing
I'II warm you up in no time
Just you wait
Come over here where it's warm
Wait right here
Dear...
Hachi, are you aII right?
What is it?
Is that aII you can say?
Do you prefer Hachi to me?
What did you say?
There's a Iimit to aII this
21-May-25
What's the matter, Hachi?
Let's go
Come on
Good boy
Now go on home
Good morning
Hachi SettIe down
Hachi
Hachi
You're barking so much
What's the matter?
The second stage can be recognized
In the fIooding that occurs
every five or ten years
This circumstance is unusuaI
The third stage wouId be
The most criticaI range
So caIIed the pro...
ProbabIe maximum
This probabIe...
Professor
Someone, quick
It's too Iate
Hachi
With the professor gone,
this house is too big for me
So I'II be going to Iive with Chizuko
Why don't they come to here to Iive?
Chizuko thinks this house is too dreary
She is so indifferent
She was born in this house, wasn't she?
I stiII sense my husband's
presence in this house...
And sometimes, it gets unbearabIe
I pIan to seII this house
You two have worked here for many years
But I must Iet you go now
It's not much,
but I'II pay you haIf a year's saIary
So pIease start giving
some thought to your future
I'II go back home to Narashino
SaiIichi?
I think I'II return to Shizuoka
I'd Iike you to have
a memento of the professor
Is there anything you want in particuIar?
I'd Iike his hat
The fedora?
No, the siIk hat
AII right
And you, Oyoshi?
I'd Iike a pair of his shoes
For your father?
If I ever marry and have a son
I'II Iet him wear it
And teII him that it beIonged
to the good professor
When he went on his waIks,
I Ioved to watch his back
Hachi...
Good bye, Hachi
Good bye, Hachi
PIease take care of yourseIf
Thank you
Thank you for everything
Take care
Missus
Are you taking Hachi?
Chizuko says that seeing Hachi
WiII onIy remind her of her father
I have an uncIe in Asakusa
I thought I'd ask him to take Hachi in
I see... Maybe that's for the best
- HeIIo - HeIIo
I took a day off from the office
to heIp with the moving
So did I. Let's do it then
What shaII we do with Father's books?
I'II have no use for books
on agricuIture and cuItivation
Take it to the used books shop
Anyway, come in
I was in a diIemma
about where to start first
Just get rid of anything oId
I'II cIean out his study
Kiku, can you heIp upstairs?
We've got a Iot of young heIpers
AII strong and spirited
So we've got our hands fuII
without any pets
But just Ieave him. I'II do what I can
Thank you
He eats anything peopIe eat
One can never teII what the future hoIds
The professor was the
picture of heaIth, yet...
Hachi...
Be good now
Good bye
He knows
I wonder how Hachi is doing?
You're such a worrywart
I'm home
You're home
Didn't you eat yet?
Mother scoIded me that
I shouId wait for my husband
The foreign office keeps unusuaI hours
So next time, pIease don't wait for me
How about a bath?
I want dinner first
Your grandmother's here to stay, Toru
How was Hachi?
I Ieft him with my uncIe in Asakusa
Dinner's ready, so pIease wash up
How oId is this house?
About 20 years
It beIonged to a coIIege professor?
Yes, an agricuIture professor
at ImperiaI University
He was worId reknown
It's so nice and bright
with aII the windows
It's sturdy for an oId house
And the price is right, don't you think?
The missus is a kind Iady
WiII she Iower the price any more?
Hachi What's the idea
I thought you were in Asakusa
Are you aII right?
I hate dogs
It beIonged to the Iate professor.
His name's Hachi
If this dog's going to come around,
I won't buy this house
Don't worry
This dog stays with a reIative in Asakusa
You mean he waIked from
Asakusa to Shibuya?
I guess so. He wouIdn't ride a train
Don't worry about this dog
Just think about the house
If it's right, pIease buy it
Remember though, get rid of the dog
That dog has no personaIity
Never reacts to a thing I say
Just turns around and starts to whine
He bites off the chain and runs away
WeII, Ieave him here again
But if he runs away, that's it
Set that up next to the bureau
And don't scratch it
Hachi
You can't stay here
That feIt good
I chopped up the doghouse for firewood
Such a fine day... perfect for moving
Hachi
Wait
Hachi, I want you to Iisten weII
Your master is dead
And this house was soId to someone eIse
The new owner can't stand dogs
It's dangerous to wander about here
He'II chop your head off with his hatchet
Hachi...
Come to my house then
I don't care for dogs myseIf
But we've known each other a Iong time
Let's go, Hachi
London, EngIand?
Yes, as a first secretary
He'II attend to the new ambassador
Are you going too?
I'II be returning to
my hometown in Wakayama
The professor's oId home?
No... he had no other reIatives
But my mother stiII Iives
I remember...
somewhere near the beach, was it?
Yes, a whaIing town
Gee, I'd Iove to see
a Iive whaIe spouting water
About Hachi...
Are you taking him?
Can you take him in?
But we have a cat...
We'II take care of him
You said you didn't want a dog
But Missus can't take Hachi
Why not?
Hachi was bred in Akita
I know that So what?
Akita is a coId pIace
Wakayama is down south...
where they catch whaIes
A dog from Akita couIdn't
adjust to the warm weather
I never met a woman who couId taIk more
Kiku, pIease take care of Hachi
I'd be so reIieved if you'd agree
AII right, I wiII
It's my way of repaying
the Iate professor
Hachi's gone
Where'd he go?
Around this time,
he's aIways at the train station...
Waiting by the exit
Hachi
I'II get your ticket
Hachi...
Your master's not coming back any more
I'm going back to Wakayama
I've asked Kiku to take care of you
Good bye, Hachi
Let's go
Hachi...
I never thought
you'd agree to take Hachi...
You hate dogs
You're such a fooI
She has her mother to
take care of back home
She couIdn't take this big thing with her
That's true
Can't you understand
simpIe human kindness?
Is that so? WeII, don't brag so much
You're getting seniIe IateIy
FooI How dare you say that to me?
What ''fooI''?
You caIIed me...
A 'fooI' first...
Dear What's wrong?
Sorry Hachi...
But I can't take you back with me
I have to take Sanae here
I've canceIIed the Iease
for the house too
You can't stay here
Hachi...
You're strong,
so don't Iose to those stray dogs
You can be the Ieader of a pack
Hachi...
Stray dogs run free
So be free and Iive proud
Good bye
Good bye
Take care
He must be waiting for his master
He doesn't reaIize that his master's dead
AdmirabIe dog
He comes every day at the same time
Such a dumb dog
You must be hungry
Come... I'II give you something
What's the matter, Hachi?
Shiro died
Poor thing. He's so skinny
It's a year now
Waiting for a master who won't return
Watching him is painfuI
Why wait for someone who won't come?
Hachi wants to wait
I know that
December, 1928
He's here again
So? Let him wait
But it's useIess
It's aII right
Hachi doesn't care
Hachi...
Enough aIready. He's not coming back
It's raining
Come here and have a bite
I'm a reporter with Asahi Shimbun
''Man's Best Friend''
''Dogs waits IoyaIIy for a master
who won't return''
Hachi
I rushed over when I read the newspaper
You've been waiting for
your master every day?
Look how dirty you are
How you must've suffered
You're the missus?
This dog comes every day in the evening
My husband reaIIy Ioved him...
It hurts to see him Iike this
I'm sorry,
but we don't have a pIace for dogs
Any corner wiII do
Isn't this the dog
that was in the papers?
Yes
So this is the IoyaI dog, Hachi?
And you are?
I knew the Iate owner, Professor Ueno
WeII then, I'II Iet this
IoyaI dog stay the night
I hope he doesn't bite though
No, he won't
Hachi is a good boy
Hachi...
He was here awhiIe ago
Hachi disappeared from the inn
It's been three days now
I guess he thought
I'd give him away again
Hachi wants to stay here
Free and unchained
I can feeI his eyes on me
I must be going
If Hachi comes, pIease feed him
We can't accept
PIease take this
AII right
Bad dog Coming here again
Take that
Scat
Two Japanese army is stiII fighting
Our team is entering the city
- It is reaIIy exiting.
- I don't want to see this
Hachi
You poor thing
Is this the mutt the paper wrote about?
He's got a name... It's Hachi
WeII, he's not waiting for his master
He's just a freeIoader waiting for food
These fouI pests shouId be put to sIeep
Say mister, you're the one
with a fouI heart
How dare you face
a customer and say that
You're no customer of mine
Enough
Take your money
Keep it
Hachi
Eat
Eat aII you want
Eat up
Poor thing
