The dead have highways...
 located in the desert
after our lives ...</ i>
 pressure populated by an endless
movement of departing souls. </ i>
 You can hear them in the
ruined parts of our world. </ i>
 through the cracks caused by barbaric acts,
violence and injustice. </ i>
 These roads have signs,
intersections and interchanges. </ i>
 On the crosses, the deaths together. </ i>
 And walk sometimes
to our world. </ i>
Hello, sweetheart.
You okay?
My God!
I look at him.
Are you sure you want to do this?
They want you intact.
He leaves.
You still hear me.
Keep the rest but.
I got it.
I know what I do.
How old are you?
- Say I do not.
Then I do not.
Non stop.
I must continue.
Of course.
Sip?
Everything for me.
Where are you going?
- Road.
As far as possible.
I can help you, I think.
I need to sleep.
Comfortable?
Where are we?
- At the end point.
A collector called me.
Probably from a
dusty old room ...
... with all terrible
artifacts around ...
... as strange tongues,
plastic stuff ...
... droppings of old people.
But just like any collector ...
... can not wait for the next.
And guess what that is?
Your skin. Strange huh?
Who am I to judge.
He paid well.
And maybe I get a bonus,
I like everything in a ...
... a whole knows it.
Please.
What will you?
Should I pass the salt?
I am still off ...
... biology students are ...
... what a beauty like you ...
... tied to lie down on a table,
to be filleted.
Jesus Christ.
You are a blood book.
Read out for me.
Why would I do that?
Well ...
Because ...
... I'll do a proposal.
We can do it slowly ...
Or I can do it quickly.
The choice is yours.
Fast.
- It is up to you.
The dead have their roads.
Roads that lead to crossings.
And coming in our world.
And if you find at some crossroads ...
Do you stop and listen.
Because the dead have stories.
Open the door, Janie.
Hold on.
Janie, make the door open.
Open the door!
Let me in!
- Reverse!
Captain!
Drift not spot us.
Paranormal.
According to Webster scientific
inexplicable.
We live around the paranormal.
If we were better looking and listening.
Remember ...
Because there is no evidence does not
say that it is not.
But is a good start.
Go sit somewhere ...
McNeal.
Simon McNeal.
I am placed.
Welcome Simon McNeal.
Sure, Simon McNeal.
Why are these places there
always ...
Ordinary matter?
The owner is hastily departed
after his daughter is murdered.
Since then it has for sale.
It was built beginning in 1900.
After that J.D Tollington
bought ...
... during the depression.
Smart guy.
He said he could talk with the dead.
People even came from Europe
for him to see.
Moreover, he entertained the rich.
What seems scary things happened.
Rumor has it that during a
session was interrupted ...
... by an invisible hand
his mouth was pressed.
That was so cold that a print
on his skin left behind what looked like a mustache.
The proof is in the autopsy report.
Suddenly he was so
thrown hard against the wall ...
That his ribs were broken
lungs punctured.
He choked in his own blood.
Make you think now?
- That it has happened.
The person left a message on the door.
Written in blood.
Drift not spot us.
The same message as
Janie left.
After you
Nothing wrong with that.
According to her parents loved Janie
much concerned with sex and death.
She took her friends to
s√©ances to top it.
Voodoo and pipe turns.
That youth of today.
Probably a truck that drove long.
Steven!
Not my son!
How do you know everything
is what you write?
How do you know it really true?
If we would not open up
the possibilities ...
We would never progress.
The truth is relative.
I mean if you can see ...
... and touch you somewhere for sure.
Professor?
So we should just trust?
It begins with this matter.
Are not you curious about
the local cuisine?
Want some?
Against insomnia.
- You get enough sex.
I'm still available.
What do you think?
That house.
Perfect for a book.
Could.
- Not too enthusiastic.
Most of my fans
think it is fiction.
Is that right?
I study the paranormal
almost ten years.
I have nothing against what came to
is verified. What is beyond doubt.
Just speculation
and probabilities.
All scientific breakthroughs
are based on nothing ...
... but on speculation and
likely present.
Just ask Galileo,
Newton and Darwin.
Would not it be nice ...
.. if your advanced equipment
finally found something to explain?
This way I can prove it.
When we are in?
McNeal.
What are you doing outside in this weather?
I go home.
- Get in, then you get a lift.
What is it?
You should not drive tonight.
- What?
Be careful, Professor.
His brother is deceased
during a car accident.
His truck was in a ditch.
With his head through the windscreen.
He broke his neck.
Simon saw it happen.
What do you mean?
He walked at night in the kitchen, and told
his parents that Stevie was dead.
That his car was verongelukt.
A few minutes later called the police ...
When his parents arrived on the scene,
it was exactly like he had described.
There is something wrong with him.
- Yes, he looks good.
He knew I would get a flat tire.
Coincidence is certainly
too much for the hand?
Maybe he can help us
with our research?
McNeal?
Do you mind?
That night it started.
In my mind.
Then there appeared a journalist
who wanted an interview.
Boy has visions
on the death of his brother.
That it attracts attention.
How do you feel then?
- Strange.
The people treated me
as a celebrity.
You did nothing to address?
Think it.
I was still young.
Did all what was going on.
Then people came to the house.
They wanted that I touched them
and tell what I saw.
So I did ...
... and I saw things.
When people said that I ...
- Was clairvoyant.
Are you well?
You love old songs?
- Well this.
Want to dance?
Come on.
Come on, this is my song.
How did it feel like?
What?
- The first time it happened to you?
The first time.
When a girl was
and the fountain spit blood.
And they found that girl.
You felt you particularly, or not?
There is a house in the neighborhood.
That of Tollington. There is
something terrible happened.
There is a girl killed.
- Good.
You are in a book.
- I want you to help me.
I do not know.
Many people say that I die
my brother got exploited.
My parents have even
money earned.
There is something terrible in
this girl happened.
Do not tell her story be?
You have a gift, Simon.
Waste not.
Help me to find out what
happened in that house.
Is it a good idea?
Can not hurt.
You know him.
You do not know what he wants to achieve.
Maybe he just ...
There is nothing said about three steps.
I get the tickle of this place.
There is something on my back.
- Sure.
Let's put everything here,
and then go tackle a beer.
I'm not kidding.
There is something on my back.
He suddenly strange.
He loves you for a ride.
Why did you do that?
I had to deal with you lot.
Fuck.
Funny.
Hi.
And?
Here is where it all happened?
That's right. Saves you here.
Can I help you?
No, I save me.
My room is just below.
If you call I hear you.
Well.
Good night.
I sleep naked.
- Sure.
Listen.
I hear nothing.
- Right.
I did not even fly
spider or ant seen.
Anywhere.
Do you?
Just as if this place is gemijt.
I can not sleep.
I think I have a fever.
When I as a child could not sleep ...
... my mother was warm milk.
And sometimes I was there.
This must surely be.
Professor?
Is it?
You cried.
- It is fine.
I had a dream.
You can close the door.
Come on, Reg.
Just see what he thinks.
You are obviously unprofessional.
What do you mean?
I'm so trained.
You have a degree.
What he added?
Although only a small chance
to us with the house to help ...
... I will encourage that.
But only that he not only
with the house helps.
If you do not like my approach ...
... then I ask someone else.
Mary?
Jesus!
Excuse me,
I heard you called.
Have you heard?
- What?
Voices, whispering.
Footsteps.
Just listen.
I have included.
There is nothing.
What?
Help, I can not!
What is there, Reg?
I get him open.
My God, what happened?
- I do not know.
I do not know what happened.
- Try not to talk.
I do not know what happened.
I'm dead
I am hell, and vice versa should
Hell me
You can better look at.
That is not something you see every day.
How that all happened, Reg?
- I do not know.
But I also know how David Copperfield
let elephants disappear.
You say that just
was a trick.
Was that whispers that you heard
a trick?
Was it?
Ga some rest.
What are you doing?
What this is, it would
be examined.
We want to make sure of that, right?
Where is he?
I do not know.
He was gone before I awoke.
I'm just curious how this stuff
on the walls came, Nigel.
You are the best forensic expert
I know.
You want me cringe. Ga me eat.
Is your wife than cooking?
Right.
I ga here to start.
Then I let you know what I think.
Let's see if Simon
some tricks in the bag is hidden.
Aspirin.
You are disappointed, Reg.
Nothing to hide, right?
Why do we not investigate.
- You make a joke.
Ga je gang. Go ahead.
Totally yours, wiseacre.
What was that?
- I do not know. It was in the bathroom ...
my equipment and went out of his roof.
My equipment is all percussion
Something is making the war.
Wait.
That can not be alone.
Simon, everything is good with you?
Help me to lift him.
Calm down.
You should lie down.
Ga lie here.
It was real.
- It is good.
It was not like before.
They came here.
You are a fucking joke.
Mocked us
I must have first aid box.
- Mary, I think we should go here.
You make a joke.
- We have enough.
We have something never before seen.
- That I mean come on.
This is ...
I do not know what this is.
I think he is.
He let this happen, and he
Our lightning.
Good, but I think that means we must
go before we are electrocuted.
I need a drink.
Mary ...
I must tell you something.
You should rest.
- No.
I must tell you, what
really going on.
It is not what you think.
I understand it, Simon.
Really.
That you do not.
That you can not.
Tonight was different.
What happened here, tonight ...
that was a miracle.
You are the miracle.
You are the one who all
possible.
You're the one I've waited.
I will tell the world,
and everyone will believe it.
I do not understand.
That is not what happened.
There was something. Something held me,
pushed me.
There was something.
What are you looking at?
What is so important?
The fountain.
That reminds you of the time
you have a girl or not?
I was ten.
There was a park across the street
of our house.
And there was a fountain, where
we always played.
But it was old.
The water never worked.
Then one night, I was
wake of a sound.
The spot anywhere.
The air was steeped ...
but not with water.
With blood.
I did not know what happened, but
it happened almost every night.
And you said nothing.
- I was too scared.
The fountain was the morning always completely
dry, as if nothing had happened.
I was afraid that everyone
would think I was crazy.
A few weeks later, came
the municipal workers ...
and vomiting from the fountain, to make
for a parking garage.
When they land uitgroeven,
they found ...
a ten-year girl, who under
was buried.
It was ...
tortured.
Her DNA was consistent with a man
the five lower floors lived.
By the time they found him, he
same with six other girls.
If I had said anything ...
It was not your fault.
I must away from here, Reg.
You did not listen
Simon, what is it?
It took until I was 13.
When stopped it.
When I started to believe them.
Maybe it never happened.
Maybe I have this gift
never had.
But when I found you.
And it started again.
And it's more intense than ever.
And I never want to lose.
I will not.
And I want you not to lose.
I think it is terrible to go.
Believe that you do not?
Let's go.
- Sorry.
Are you, Mary Florescu?
Yes, I am.
- Would you please sign for me?
The soul of Agnes Wishington.
This is my second copy of
'Visits in the Paranormal. "
I have the other so often read,
that the pages fell out.
"I believe with my whole heart ...
that a parallel universe
living together with those of us'.
A landscape of souls,
we can not see ...
stories scream,
that must be told.
They never forget to be
otherwise ...
that horrible death. "
- 'It has no meaning.
And God is just backwards,
to more suffering. "
Sorry, this is Simon McNeal, works
me one of my projects.
I understand.
Then you must also sign.
- Sure.
Sorry, excuse me a moment.
- I write it here.
Sorry, my phone was probably
no range.
What?
I have not heard.
Tell me, Nigel.
Are you sure?
I find that too.
- Since you must focus on.
It was nice to meet you.
- Thank you very much.
Where the hell are you going out?
So, now we play some
game?
Have we already done all the time?
Potassium nitrate.
Also known as ...
gunpowder.
Perfect for things to write on walls,
and spontaneously fire fly.
And here we have protein. It is
actually a part of protein.
Sulfa.
Handsome boy.
Sulfa and carbon.
Let's see ...
Yes, as you get from charcoal.
Charcoal for artists.
Perfect for writing on walls.
Okay, so ...
I have some things distorted.
- The tire on my car?
And the fountain when I was a girl?
How did you feel?
- I do my homework.
I tried to tell you, I
wanted to explain, but you did not listen.
You better leave.
- Listen.
There is something wrong in this house. Good?
The first time the top?
Yes, when I pretended.
But the second time, that was real.
That went far beyond the few
pieces of charcoal.
Much more than a boy in
a laboratory coat you could ever tell.
I thought you were smarter than this, Simon.
I thought ...
briefly, that you really were.
 I would not lose you. </ i>
 nothing to hide anyway? </ i>
 Well, I have some things distorted. </ i>
 But the second time, that was real. </ i>
 I tried to tell you. </ i>
 I wanted to explain to you, but you
would not listen to me. </ i>
Hold on please!
If he gunpowder
here received.
Come on, there is more.
Pay attention to him.
Thoughts transfer directly from Houdini.
- If he does it.
Watch his hand.
It took a while for
I doorhad.
Vibration transmitter.
- I thought it was sewn under his mattress.
He has my lapping equipment.
I thought I was him with a
removal of the saw.
He should have paid him, so that
for him to resign.
God knows what other tricks
he still has.
I am sorry, I just wanted to be happy
that it were true.
Forget it. You were just
not yourself.
You're right, that I was not.
I was weak, and he was ...
Hard.
Little liar.
Cute little liar.
I really thought that he was special.
For what it worth,
I thought so too.
But briefly.
Let's go to Elliot.
Pizza dinner, house wine.
That funny little trickster forgotten.
I am not an imposter.
Hell here on Thursday.
You understand it.
And you'll never understand.
I hear here.
This house, that is me.
It has chosen me, me!
It is always about you, or not?
Always about you.
This is about me.
I told you that I had a gift,
and which is mine removed.
But I am now back.
I got it back, and I do not let it
Show me fall.
So I'm going to show you. I ga the
once and for all evidence.
You can stop now, Simon.
Please.
If I'm ready, you'll beg
my story or you may have.
And it will be greater than any other book
you have written. You know why?
Because all true.
Well. You write it.
Well, no truckjes.
We can not here him
just leave.
Why we call the police,
and tell them that there is a burglar.
Little bastard, not again.
You have to hear.
We are in the middle of an intersection.
I understand now.
That is what this house is.
A crossroads of the deceased.
The dead have highways.
Highways leading to crossings.
Highways in our world flows.
He has led us to a cross.
He is not the one who does.
You're it.
Stop.
Tell them that you will listen.
Where to listen?
You understand it really, do you?
They have waited ...
someone who will listen.
On someone who will hear their stories.
I promised that we will listen.
And I will give you stories
to the world.
 She had made them a promise. </ i>
 a promise that I should keep. </ i>
 And their stories were coming.
Day after day ...</ i>
 night after night. </ i>
 They had me locked up in
that country that they had purchased. </ i>
 With all the money they
of her books earned. </ i>
My skin  reading. </ i>
Let us continue.
She said that I would be their book.
And it would be their interpreter.
Write their stories.
The stories they wrote on me.
But I could not anymore.
So I'm away.
I ran and I ran ...
But they were writing.
And they kept writing.
You know what?
You tell a good story, my friend. But I
regret to say that I am not moved.
I feel nothing.
Be fast.
Have you money? Of course.
Nicely done.
Suitable for Freeman.
 The stories go on. </ i>
Who's there?
What ...
Help me.
The stories go on.
 They bleed and bleed. </ i>
The deceased have  highways. </ i>
 Only the person who lives lost. </ i>
 But there are signs and bridges ...</ i>
 where the deceased will stop
for you to tell their stories. </ i>
 Because telling them deliver
of the story. </ i>
 And it is just best to listen. </ i>
