What is love?
Love? Love is life.
Love? What is love?
Why and where?
l believe that God predetermined
all our emotional relationships.
But He left it to us
to find each other.
He made us all couples..
..and each one has a soul mate.
A soul mate? What nonsense!
l don't believe in all this..
l'm absolutely sure. Somewhere,
someone has been made for me..
..and that someday, l
shall certainly meet him.
Okay, but will
someone please tell me..
..how would l know
who was made for me?
l mean, will she be holding
a placard with my name on it?
When l see her, will
there be a clap of thunder..
..or a flash of lightning? What?
How would l recognise her?
l don't know what others would do,
but l'll certainly know it's him.
He will tell me..
He will give me a sign, and
my heart would know its him.
What is all this?
- This is love.
Love?

"However far apart they may be.."
"Their paths will meet,
come what may."
"When two people are
made for each other."
"Made for each other."
"Like the heart and heartbeats..
- Made for each other."
"Like the eye and the mirror..
- Made for each other."
"Like the monsoon and the rains..
- Made for each other."
"There's a man for every woman..
- Made for each other."
"Made for each other"
"When God made a heart.."
"..He split it in two."
"He gave them two names.."
"..Radha and Krishna"
"Now the two hearts beat."
"They part and they unite."
"For they are made for each other."
"Made for each other."

"l didn't get an inkling when.."
"..furtively, like a thief.."
"l didn't get an inkling when.."
"..furtively, like a thief.."
"..the first look of love.."
"..stole my heart away."
"Stole my heart away."
"l didn't get an inkling when.."
"..furtively, like a thief.."
"..the first look of love.."
"..stole my heart away."
"Stole my heart away."
"Stole my heart away"
"ln the hide-n-seek
of my first love.."
"..l took refuge in the shelter
of his eyes without a thought."
"Now l'm frightened.."
"..because furtively,
like a thief.."
"..the first look of love.."
"..stole my heart away"
"Stole my heart away"
"My hair dishevelled, my gait
uncertain as if l were drunk."
"Were l seen, it would
raise a million questions."
"Oh, how do l go home?"
"..for furtively, like a thief.."
"..the first look of love.."
"..stole my heart away"
"Stole my heart away"
"l didn't get an inkling when.."
"..furtively, like a thief.."
"..the first look of love.."
"..stole my heart away."
Jimmy, is Rahul at the entry point?
- No, Rahul's not here.
What do you mean not there?
He's supposed to enter in
two minutes. Find him, fast!
Oh, God. l'll be right back.
"Stole my heart away"
Shruti, did you find Rahul?
- No.
"Stole my heart away."
"l didn't get an inkling when.."
"..furtively, like a thief.."
"l didn't get an inkling when.."
"..furtively, like a thief.."
"The first glance of love.."
"..stole my heart away."
Yes, very good. Keep it up,
everyone. - Rahul..
Rahul! l've told you
numerous times that..
..you should be at the wing
five minutes before your entry.
When you're not there, l start
fretting that you'll be late..
l got this idea at the last minute
And l thought that if l
shoot out on to the stage..
..the audience will freak out,
and that's what happened.
And anyway, there was no goof up.
What's the fuss all about?
Look Rahul, l'm fed up
with your last minute entries.
Hey Nisha, l'm the director.
l can change whatever and
whenever l want, including you.
Forget it. You'll never
find another dancer like me.
l can get Shruti to dance
better than you. - Shut up!
Nisha! Fight with him later.
lt's time to go on stage.
Take the mike.
- Go and tell Suppandi. - l'll tell.
What?
- What?
Okay everybody,
let's get the lights.
ldiot.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
l'd like to thank you all on
behalf of the entire team..
..for making this dance show a
huge success. Thank you so much.
As you all know, this is
the last night of this show.
However, l promise you that
we'll be back here in three months..
..with a new story, new songs..
..and a new name. Maya.
Maya? - Yes, 'Maya' is the
name of our new dance show.
Thank you very much everybody,
and good night to you.
Cheers!
Wonderful.
- We had good fun at the show.
Hey, hang on a minute.
Rahul, this new play 'Maya'..
What's it all about? Tell us.
Tell us Rahul. Please.
- Get up.
Tell us about it.
- Okay, okay.
Maya.
l don't know. - What? - l
don't know. - What is this?
lf you didn't know that,
then why did you tell everyone..
..that we're doing a
new play called 'Maya'..
..and that we'll do
it in three months?
Now look, even l don't
know who or what Maya is..
..but l do know that in three
months we'll do a play called 'Maya'.
Do you have in mind a
girl who's like Maya?
She's still in my imagination,
not in my mind.
Nisha! l've got a girl in mind.
Rahul! aren't you talking about
Pammi, the Colonel's daughter?
Am l right? lsn't it Pammi?
Rahul, is Maya the kind of
girl you can fall in love with?
l don't fall in love with girls.
Girls fall in love with me.
- There he goes again.
But Maya is the kind of
girl that anyone could love.
Maya is the kind of girl for
whom you would leave your Soni.
You dare not cheat on my sister.
- Ballu, relax. Quite.
What does she do?
She comes in dreams.
ls Maya beautiful?
Very.
This Maya must be doing something.
She must be working, singing,
dancing..
Maya dances, but not like you. -
What? - She dances only for herself.
Excuse me, but she is a feeling,
A fantasy, she's beautiful..
..and she dances, and we've
got to find her in three months.
So who is she?
Maya is all these things,
and yet she is only Maya.
Oh, Rahul. There you go
again on the same topic.
l'm hungry. l'll get
something to eat. Okay?
Hey, leave him alone.
- You all carry on. l'm coming.
Maya.
l've spent my life managing chores.
l'll make a decision today.
Good morning, aunty!
- Silly girl! Where were you?
l've been looking for you all over.
- l was outside.
Now you must to come with me.
Where? - l'm tired of
you uncle's daily nonsense.
So, today there will be a fight,
and you must take my side.
Okay. Let's go.
"Sometimes, a thought.."
"..crosses my mind.."
Bravo, bravo!
"As ifyou all have
been called only for me."
Wow. - "You've been
scrubbing dishes so long.."
"You've been made to sit in
the audience for my sake."
Bravo, bravo. What a performance!
Sir. Excuse me, Sir.
Go on, Chandni..l mean, Shanti.
lf you permit, could
we have a tea break?
Break whatever you want.
lf you don't mind, may l
have a word with your students?
Of course.
Watchman, gardener..
- Yes, ma'am.
Shankar and Ramu.
- Yes.
lf you don't mind, will
you all get back to work now?
Where are you going?
- Thank you.
Why are you driving
away my audience? - Quiet.
You gather all the servants
here and stall all the work.
l have to do all the chores myself.
Today onwards, no
more music recitals.
Henceforth, only you will
listen to your music. No audience.
My music isn't
appreciated in my own house.
How would anybody
else appreciate it?
Thanks to your aunt's attitude, l
could never become a great singer.
l know, l know. Now forget
it and have a cup of tea.
No, l don't want any tea.
- Oh come on, Uncle.
Have a cup of tea,
and sing a song for me.
Will you listen to my song?
- Of course.
Really?
- Certainly.
So let me have the tea.
Pooja. There's a parcel for you.
lt's from Ajay!
Should be his cassette.
l'll hear it right away.
- Hear my song first.
Later, Uncle. please!
See that? You always
drive my audience away
What are you dreaming of?
l was thinking how fast time flies.
lt seems like yesterday that Mr.
Khanna and Geeta had that accident..
..and the ten-year
old Pooja came home.
And now, it seems as if we
never had a life without her.
And l have never seen such
close friends as Pooja and Ajay.
'Hey, fatty! How are you?'
Shut up, l'm not fat.
'l've heard that these days
you've really put on some weight.'
'Don't do that or no
one will marry you!'
ldiot. Don't worry about my
marriage. Who's going to marry you?
'By now, you must have finished
cursing me. So l'll proceed.'
'l'm having fun, as usual, and
work and girls are keeping me busy.'
'Tell you what? l never realised how
handsome l am when l was in lndia.'
'Don't make faces. lf you wish,
l can fax you..
..a list of my girlfriends.'
No, thank you.
'For your information..
l've broken up with Tina..'
'..because she
doesn't like Hindi films.'
Thank God. She was so stupid.
'And now l've fallen for
someone else.' - Who is she?
'Don't yell, l'm telling you.
She's Dolly.' - Dolly?
'There's no need to worry.
She loves Hindi movies.'
Wow.
- 'Oh, l forgot.'
'l might be coming to
Bombay for a few days.' - When?
'No need to stand. Sit down.'
'lt's not fixed as yet. As soon
as l get to know, l'll tell you.'
'Okay, l'm off. Dolly
must be on her way..'
'..and even though you haven't said
so, l'll convey your affections.'
There's no need.
- 'Okay, l won't.'
'Hey. Here she comes.
Okay, l'm going.'
'Give mom and dad my love.
Take care, bye.'- Stupid.
Hi. Nisha, where have you put
that cassette you took from my car?
There was a really important
music piece of our play on it.
Anything that goes into
your room vanishes forever.
Where is the cassette?
Rahul, don't you have the manners..
..to knock before
coming into a girl's room.
ls there a girl here?
l.. Stop it, Rahul. l'm serious.
Look, don't give me all
this girl talk. Please!
You have also entered my room at
times when l had nothing on. So?
That's different. - Why is it
different? Don't l feel shy?
Shut up, Rahul..
- You shut up!
Go on now. Get my cassette.
Oh. Thank..
First say sorry, and then
you'll get the cassette.
Must l say sorry?
- Yes.
Say sorry to you?
- Yes.
Why you.. Nisha.
Nisha, give that here.
Don't play stupid games with me.
- You stupid.
lf l catch you, you're dead.
- l'm not giving it to you.
l'll get you. Give
me back my cassette.
Come on, give me back my cassette.
Give it to me.
- l won't!
Give it to me, l say.
- Okay, okay.
Now say you're sorry.
- Sorry for what?
Sorry that you've wasted my time,
and made me run around.
l'm not saying sorry.
- You won't?
l'm sorry.
- Say you'll never annoy me again.
l'll never annoy you.
- Say 'Rahul is the best'.
Never!
Rahul is the best. Okay?
- l know. Thank you very much.
Rahul is the worst. Rahul
is a dog, Rahul is a monkey.
Come what may, l'm not
going to dance in your play.
So be it. l'll find
dancers like you aplenty.
There isn't a single
dancer as good as me.
"Fall in love."
"Lose your heart to someone.
Fall in love.."
"Fall in love.."
"You're still young. Someone
out there is meant for you."
"Find him, oh, lovelorn heart."
Pooja!
"You are young.
There's somebody for you."
My wedding has been fixed.
- Wedding?
l'm sorry.
- Six, seven, eight.
"Fall in love.."
What's wrong with you, Anjali?
You're going to marry
someone you haven't chosen?
Someone you hardly know.
l do know him.
He's Mr. Kapoor's son.
l've known him for years.
But you don't love him.
Well, Pooja. Love will
happen in due course.
Love happens in due course?
Are you saying that, Anjali?
We're not kids any more, Pooja.
lt's time we out grew
our world of fantasies.
We are lndian girls.
Our companion for life is never
same as the man in our dreams.
We don't even choose him.
Someone else chooses him for us.
We learn to love him.
This is the truth, and the
sooner you realise it, the better.
Don't make this mistake, Anjali.
Someone, somewhere is made for you..
..and you should wait for him.
Perhaps he is the one.
l believe that this is the
one who was made for me..
..and l'm going to live
through with this belief.
And who knows? This
might happen to you.
Tomorrow you might marry a
man whom you merely know..
..and slowly you might realise that
he was the one you were waiting for.
"There's someone for you.
You find him out."
Nothing like this is
going to happen to me.
l'll choose my companion myself.
This is impossible, Rahul.
There can't be a girl like this.
What does that mean?
- lt's a meaningless character.
Maya refuses to come out
of her dreams.
Modern girls aren't like this.
What do you know?
You're not a even girl.
Stop it, Rahul. l'm serious.
Modern girls.. - Maya is not
one of these modern girls.
She's different.
She is my Maya.
Your Maya, indeed. What
do you know about girls?
You know only one. And that's me!
What do you mean? l don't
know anything about love..
..and yet l make love stories.
What of it?
Rahul, your Maya looks
absolutely crazy to me.
Don't you call my Maya crazy.
And you are the only
one who thinks like that.
Nobody else talks like this.
- Definitely!
Rahul, l think Nisha is right.
- Thank you.
l don't understand 'Maya' either.
Her character seems fake.
lsn't it Raju.
l agree.
Looking at it from a
psychological point of view..
..l feel that you're on
your own trip of Utopia.
l'm on a fantasy trip.
l'm sorry, Maya is
not in. l'm sorry.
You want to say something too?
- l think we need a lunch break.
Exactly. See?
l don't know if such a girl
exists or not..and l don't want to.
Whether she is a lie, a
fantasy or crazy or whatever..
..she's Maya.
lf you don't understand this,
l'm very sorry, l can't help it..
..But all of you get
one thing straight.
l am not going to change
Maya's character, come what may.
Excuse me.
What's this?
- l think Rahul's right.
You shut up. You
are Rahul's yes-man.
l was only saying that..
- Okay.. what were you saying?
Do you know of such a girl?
- No!
ls your Soni like this?
- No.
You figure the character of Maya?
- No.
Should we do this play?
- Never.
That's exactly what l've
been saying. - Right, but..
Not again.
- Hey, what is going on?
What do you think you
are doing? - Shut up.
"That innocent face."
"The mischief in her eyes."
"Oh my!"
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"..stands afar shying away."
"Oh my!"
"For a fleeting moment she
shows herself, and then turns away"
"Oh my!"
"lf you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her."
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"..stands afar shying away."
"Oh my!"
"For a fleeting moment she
shows herself, and then turns away"
"Oh my!"
"lf you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her."
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"Oh my!"

"She's no ordinary girl,
she's a wonder."
"How else can l describe her?"
"Last night she came in my
dreams with her tresses flowing."
"When l woke up, l wished l
could return to my dream."
"lf this is how l feel
without meeting her.."
"..what would happen when l do?"
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"..stands afar shying away"
"Oh my!"
"For a fleeting moment she shows
herself, and then turns away."
"Oh my!"
"lf you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her."
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"Oh my!"
"Dark as the monsoon
clouds is the kohl in her eyes"
"Her gait has the grace
of the waves in the ocean"
"Wonder what He created her of."
"l wish she appears
before me out of nowhere."
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"..stands afar shying away"
"Oh my!"
"For a fleeting moment she shows
herself, and then turns away."
"Oh my!"
"lf you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her"
"That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes.."
"..stands afar shying away"
"Oh my!"
Yeah!
- Hey, what are you all doing?
Rahul, how do you
like this? Hold this.
Nisha, maybe you didn't notice
that everyone is staring at us.
So what? l don't care.
- But l'm looking funny.
Oh come on. How do
you like the orange?
Very nice. Nisha.
- l'll be back in a moment.
Nisha.
'..you are requested to
collect your parcels..'
'..from the delivery counters.'
Shopping?
- Yes.
Alone?
- Yes.
Very good! Never make the mistake
of going shopping with a girl.
How do you like this shirt?
Cool, isn't it? - You like it?
l really like it.
- l love it! Let's go.
Try it on once.
- Both of us like it.. let's go.
Rahul.
- To hell with Rahul!
So sweet!
- What did you say?
Nothing, nothing at all. Offyou go!
Who is it?
Sorry! ldiot.
Okay? Happy?
Why are you laughing? What's up?
Where are yourjeans?
l'm wearing it..
lt happens.
Who is it?
Crazy!
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday.
Everybody clap.. Open the cake box.
- Hey.
Pooja. How did this happen?
"What happened and
when did it happen?"
How did this get swapped over?
l had ordered a chocolate cake.
You must have picked up
someone else's parcel.
l'm so stupid! l should've checked.
l'm sorry, uncle.
- lt's all right, dear.
Other people celebrate their
birthdays by cutting a cake.
l'll celebrate mine by
cutting sandwiches. No big deal.
Come on. Come on.
Let me see who got my cake.
- Where are the candles?
Rahul.
- Pooja
Who's Pooja?
- l don't know.
And who's uncle?
- Must be Pooja's uncle.
First time l sent you on an errand,
and you picked the wrong parcel.
What have l done? l brought the
parcel the shopkeeper gave me.
But you should have checked.
Excuse me..but it
wasn't up to me to check.
Next time, do it yourself. Okay?
l'm hungry and this cake
looks awesome. Let's dig in.
Stop it. No one's eating this cake.
Why not? - Because it
belongs to someone else.
They must be eating
our sandwiches too.
There's an address written here.
lt's nearby. Go and return it.
Are you nuts?
This is someone's birthday cake,
ordered with love.
Someone's party will be ruined.
Go and give it back.
l'm not going.
Rahul
- To hell with Rahul!
Jimmy, let's go and return it
and say 'Happy Birthday!' Come on.
So sweet!
- What did you say?
Nothing.
Shut up!
Yes?
Good evening. Are you uncle?
No, l'm aunty.
Actually, by mistake l
got your cake, aunty.
The sandwich man.
- That's right.
Here's your cake, and
wishing you a happy birthday.
Thank you and sorry.
Why sorry? - Because we've
eaten all your sandwiches.
That's all right. Actually, l ate
a bit of your cake on the way here.
No wonder!
- Yes.
Okay, l'll be off Uncle.
- No. Come in, and have some cake.
No thanks. l'm in a hurry.
Some other time.
Just a minute. Just
one minute, please.
Let the person who
bought this cake thank you.
There's no need.
- No, no!
Uncle.
- Pooja, Pooja.
Pooja, Pooja.
- Yes, Uncle.
That poor man, whose
sandwiches you picked up by mistake..
..has brought the cake back.
- How sweet!
He's at the door. Go and thank him.
- Okay.
Thank him.
- Okay.
"The cake has brought
a twinkle in my eyes.."
"..and a musical rhythm to
the strings of my stomach."
"The cake is here."
To fit or not to fit. Not to fit.
What a fool!
'We welcome you.'
'Happy Valentines Day.'
Why are you buying all this stuff?
Come on, Anjali. lt's
Valentine's Day today.
Valentine's day?
What is this Valentine's day?
- Don't you know?
The one you love most in the
world is called your Valentine.
On this day, all lovers pour
their hearts out to each other.
This is all about love.
You won't understand.
Very funny! But whom are you
buying all these things for?
For myself.
- What?
Look, l don't have a lover who'd
buy me all these lovely things.
So l'm pleasing myself.
You've lost it.
Do you know, today is no
ordinary Valentine's Day.
lt falls on the same
day as the full moon.
Know what this means?
l don't, but l'm sure
you're going to tell me.
lt means that if you believe
that someone is made for you..
..and you are waiting
for him with a true heart..
..you would
certainly meet him today.
And you really believe this?
Of course. l'm absolutely sure..
..that before midnight l
shall meet my soul mate.
Pooja, you're really mad.
- That l am.
Rahul.
- Forget Rahul!
l'm going home. You can
come along if you want to.
Rahul, we all came together
and we'll all go together.
This is a very boring party.
Tell me if you want to come.
Rahul, when will you grow up?
Look, how beautiful the night is,
and you're so unromantic.
Just look at those couples.
They look so lovely..
..dancing in each other's arms.
You think that they're all in love?
- Of course.
Sit down.
Tell me something, Nisha. What
do you think.. what is love?
Love is when you're
so fond of someone..
..that you want to spend the
rest of your life in his arms.
That's what we call love.
l see. You think all
these people here..
..want to spend the rest of
their lives with each other?
l think so.
Girls are so dumb.
Do you know, most of these romances
would be over before the night is?
They'll fight over small things..
..and will never see
each other after tonight.
And next year, you
will see the same faces..
..at the same place
but in different arms.
Boys are so stupid.
- l'm telling you the truth, Nisha.
You must agree that you need
to know someone really well..
..to spend your life together.
- That's right.
And in order to know someone well
you need to spend time together?
True. - ln today's times,
who has the time?
Look. ln this party, no
one's known each other..
..for as long as
we've known each other.
Does that mean that we can
spend a lifetime with each other?
Let me put it this way. Will you
be able to spend a lifetime with me?
Here you are, Rahul. And
everyone wants you outside!
Why? - Nothing as such.
Everyone wants a song from you.
Oh no.. - Oh, come on.
- l don't want to sing.
'Tell me, will you be able
to spend a lifetime with me?'
Yes Rahul, l can.
l could spend my
whole life with you.
Rahul, Rahul, Rahul, Rahul.

Hello?
- Have you lost it?
Are you out of your mind? Why did
you leave without telling anyone?
You said we had come together,
and we'd all leave together.
Then you run away all on your own.
You know that we're all worried.
ldiot. Stupid. Fool.
Hello?
This is not 6711237, is it?
No.
- l thought so.
l'm sorry, l thought
it was someone else.
You're right. l am someone else.
l'm really sorry. Please excuse me.
lt's okay.
- Thank you..
Hang on, one minute.
Don't hang up, please. - Yes?
The music you're playing..
..that's Pt. Shiv Kumar
Sharma's latest album, isn't it?
Yes.
- l thought so.
You know, l wanted to buy it too.
Where did you buy it from?
From Rhythm House.
- l haven't been there.
Do you think
they'd have it in stock?
How would l know?
l'm so stupid. How would you know?
You don't work there, right?
l'm really sorry about all this.
lt's okay.
- Good night
Good night.
- l'm really very sorry.
lt's okay.
- Happy Valentine's.
Happy Valentine's.
Nice voice.
That's all, Mr. Simpson..
Okay l'll try meeting you.
l'll do that.
Tell him not to worry about it.
Okay. All right, see you.
Ajay!
Ajay, you idiot.
How dare you do this to me?
You scared the hell out of me.
How far will you run?
Wait till l get you.
- There comes the fatty.
How dare you call me fatty?
Dare you scare me.
Move aside, Uncle.
- Take this.
Catch me if you can, fatty.
You called me fatty again?
Aunt, look at him.
Aunt!
Wait till l get you.
Tired?
Shall we?
Cut it!
Ballu! What are you up to?
- Why, what's wrong, Rahul?
The spotlight should move from
me to Nisha after the drum roll.
And l thought..
- Shut up.
Come on, Nisha. Do it again.
Let's take it from the top.
Rahul..
- Rahul's done for! What is it?
Please pack up early today.
- Why? What's special about today?
Nothing. Come on. - Come on,
let's take it from the top.
Rahul, you forgot?
lt's Nisha's birthday.
Really? Why didn't someone tell me?
- Yes.
Nisha, what's wrong with you?
- Catch. Thanks.
Why didn't you tell me?
There are some things, Rahul,
which one knows without being told.
Even then.. you people
should have said something.
Honestly, you guys are the limit..
Rahul! Just relax!
- l'm very angry.
Rahul! Just relax.
- Very angry.
You've been forgetting it all these
years. This is just another year.
Stop drop that stupid face, and
take us all out to dinner. Come on.
Yeah!
- Come on guys, let's go.
Nisha.
What is it?
Happy birthday.
You remembered? Why
didn't you say it?
There are some things which
one knows without being told.
You idiot! Thank you.
- lt's okay, Nisha.-Yes.
Let's rehearse.
- Rahul.
Just joking. Come on, everybody.
Then she didn't agree at all.
- So sweet.
Cheers!
- Okay, everybody. Tequila time.
Rahul, l want the bigger one.
Yes, the largest one. Raju, for you?
Jimmy okay.
- What are you guys drinking?
Tequila.
l want some. - This isn't for
girls. Go, and have a soft drink.
No, l want some.
- l told you. This is not for you.
lt's my birthday today.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
l'll do as l please.
Nisha. Okay, suit yourself. Pepsi.
Give me another glass.
So sweet. Nothing.
You're in love?
Give over. l know your kind of love.
lt changes every week.
This is your kind of love, not mine.
You mean, the marrying kind?
Really?
Who's the girl? Do l know her?
Really well.
Tell me who she is, please.
Ajay.
Must l?
- Yes.
Forget it.
- Ajay. - That hurts.
Okay! One, two, three, go!
Didn't l tell you?
lt's not for girls.
One more.
Rahul's done for.
Please, Ajay. Tell me who she is.
Okay, let's do this. See
that waiter? - Which one?
The one serving water.
- Yes.
Keep looking at him.
lf there's still a glass
of water on that tray..
..by the time he gets to our
table then l'll tell you her name.
Promise?
- Promise.
Okay.
- Okay.
Oh, my God. Excuse me.
A glass ofwater, please.
That's cheating.
- So what?
You can't do that. -
Everything is fair in love and war.
Look. Look..
- Thank you!
Everything is fair in love and war.
You idiot.
Nisha, please. Nisha!
"l feel lonely.." - Nisha,
shut up! - Rahul is a bad boy.
Nisha, please. Shut up now.
Yes.
"Don't say a word.
Say nothing at all."
"Take my shoes, and give me money."
- Please go to sleep, Nisha.
"Take the shoes, and give
me money." - What nonsense.
Go to sleep. Good night.
l'm scared, Rahul.
Don't leave me, l'm scared.
lt's really late. Now
quietly go to sleep. Good night.
No. First promise me
that you won't leave me.
Okay, fine. l won't leave you alone.
You won't leave me, even if l
ask for an ice-cream, will you?
No, l won't.
You won't leave me, even if
l don't dance well, will you?
No, l won't.
Not even if l call you names
like donkey, monkey, will you?
Of course, l won't.
You won't leave me, even if l
tell you that l love you, will you?
l love you, Rahul.
l really love you, Rahul.
l love you.
Pooja!
There she is..still asleep!
Come on, Pooja. lt's 7:00am
The sun is up, Pooja.
Pooja.
What is it? What is it?
You? You idiot. ls this
the way to wake someone up?
l'm so sorry, but seeing you fast
asleep, l just couldn't resist it.
How could l miss out
on such an opportunity?
You idiot. Stupid.
- l'm sorry.. sorry, sorry
Listen, get ready quickly.
We've got to go to the airport.
Airport? Are you going somewhere?
No. We are.
We? And where are we going?
Well, that's a surprise.
lt's not far from lndia,
it's nearby.
We'll return by tonight's flight.
Get ready quickly.
l don't get you.
Silly. lt's very simple. l
have to go on some business.
lt'll take me just an
hour..just sign some papers..
..and then l am free.
lf you come along,
you'll see a new city ..
..as well as get some shopping done.
And anyway l'm leaving
for London tomorrow.
That leaves only today..
..which l want to
spend with you. So simple.
But Ajay, l must find out if
it's okay with uncle and aunt.
l've already got their approval.
lt's only you who has to decide.
So fatty, are you coming or not?
Of course, l'm coming!
- That's great.
Then hurry up and get ready.
The flight is on time.
Wait a minute. What's
that under your eye?
Where?
- There.
Now wait, you fatty!
Stop there, fatty!
Never mind. l'll get you for this.
- Come and get me.
Oh!
You're going shopping,
aren't you? We'll see.

'Passengers travelling
on Air lndia's flight..'
'..Al101 are requested to
see the immigration office..'
..-Well, Mister Ajay. Time to go.
Now l'll have to go.
- Did you say something?
Pooja, l want to tell you something.
Tell me. What is it?
This quick business trip of a
couple of days was all a pretence.
l came here for something else.
lt's been eight
years since l left lndia.
l've earned enough
of respect and money.
l've had enough of this hectic life.
l want to stop now. l
want to settle down now.
And whenever l close my eyes..
..to think whom l'd like to
spend the rest of my life with..
..it is always your face that l see.
ln those moments we spent together,
l don't know how or when..
..my feelings for
you turned to love.
But l had no clue
about your feelings.
l don't know whether
you like someone..
..whether there is
anyone in your life.
That's what l came here to find out.
l don't know what you think of me.
l don't even know if you would want
to spend your whole life with me.
But l know for
sure that l love you..
..and l want to marry you.
'This is the last and final
call for passengers travelling..'
'..on Air lndia's
flight Al 101 to London.'
l'll go towards the
departure gate now.
Once l'm there, l'll
turn around and look.
lf your answer is affirmative,
stay here.
And if you're not here,
l'll understand.
And one more thing.
Don't forget that
whatever your decision is..
..we were friends, we are friends,
and we'll always be friends. Okay?
'Who knows, it may
happen to you too.'
'You might end up marrying a man..'
'..you only know but don't love.'
'..and then gradually you
realise that he's the one..'
'..whom you've been waiting for.'
What? But why did you stay?
Sometimes, there's so much joy
in making someone else happy..
..that l can't
think of anything else.
You should have seen his face,
Anjali. He was so happy.
l have never seen him so happy.
And what about your happiness?
You don't love him, Pooja.
Love?
What about love? lt
happens in due course. lsn't it?
And we are lndian girls.
We can't choose our life partners.
Someone else chooses
our life partners for us.
We learn to love them.
lsn't that true?
The girl finally outgrows her
dreams and turns to a woman.
No, Anjali. The girl
has become a woman..
..but she hasn't
given up her dreams.
She believes in them completely,
even now.
She's sure that Ajay is the one
for whom she has always been waiting.
Maybe He is delaying the indication.
l'm sure that you'll
be very happy with Ajay.
l hope so.
What happened, Nisha? Take
her to the doctor, hurry.
Slow down, Rahul. We're
almost there. Slow down.
Get a stretcher, Suppandi.
Admit her.
- Take this. - Okay, sir.
Hi, Doctor.
- There's no need to worry.
lt's a small fracture.
She'll go home in a week or so.
l told you Nisha would
start dancing again in a week.
l'm talking about
going home, not dancing.
She can't dance for
another three months.
Three months?
- Yes, Rahul.
Her heel is very delicate.
lf she doesn't take care,
the fracture could recur..
..and it could be more serious.
Does she know this.
- Yes. - May l see her?
Of course. You don't need my
permission. - Thank you, Doctor.
l'll see you guys.
Who's going to get me a cup of tea?
God! You'll never
learn to knock, will you?
Don't give me that girl talk.
l have something very
important to discuss.
Yes, tell me. - Can you see
me properly? How many fingers?
Stop it, Rahul.
- Jokes apart.
Okay! Look, this Dr. Kapoor
of yours isn't up to much.
l think you should see
some other doctor. - Why?
This doctor was talking about
getting you discharged in a week.
So what?
- No, it's not done.
lt's been such a task
getting you to the hospital.
You should spend at
least a month or two in here.
Mean..- And while you are away,
we'll also have some peace.
Rahul, l hate you.
You're so horrible. - Slowly..
You're always making fun of me.
l hate you. You're so bad.
Nisha, behave yourself.
Sorry, nurse.
She has gone mad with the pain.
But don't worry, l'll take
care of her. l'm a psychologist.
Sis..
- Rahul.
Yes?
- l'm sorry.
For what?
l've put you
through so much trouble.
You've taken so much
money from the sponsors..
..and how would you
find a dancer so soon?
And for three months, l..
- Now look..
..there's no need for you to worry.
Rahul.
- Rahul's done for!
What do you think?
You're a good dancer?
There are scores of
fabulous dancers in town.
Sure, but you'll never find..
- A dancer like you, right?
Right.
- Now you don't worry about this.
Now get some rest and
l'll see you in the evening.
Okay. - And you don't need to
eat the boring hospital food.
l'll bring some food.
We'll eat together.
lt's a deal. Right?
Bye.
- Bye.
Rahul.
- l know. Chinese, right?
Right.
Not to worry. lt'll all work out.
- How will it all work out?
We've borrowed money
from the sponsors,
..and paid a
deposit for the stadium.
Where are we going to
find a dancer like Nisha?
Come on, if we try, don't you
think we can find one good dancer?
There are plenty of dance schools.
One is right next to
our rehearsal hall.
We'll find a dancer there tomorrow.
Yes! Yes, Jimmy. You're right.
How about that,
Rahul? Come on, relax.
Whatever happens
will be for the best.
Let's go, and have
some chilled beer.
No.. You go ahead. l'm not
in the mood. - Come on, buddy!
Relax, pal. Try to understand.
He's tired.
Come on, we'll push off.
- See you guys. Take care.
Bye, bye.
- Come on, Supandi. - l'll see you.?
First you give me your
address and phone number.
Maya..
l'll find her.
Maya.
"Water, water."
"Water, water in my eyes."
- Excuse me..
The sandwich man.
Shanti, has a parcel
come here by mistake? - No..
l haven't come for a parcel today. -
Then tell me what l can do for you.
l want to meet your daughter.
- l don't have a daughter.
No daughter?
- No.
Then sir, Ms. Pooja Malhotra?
Pooja is like my daughter.
- l see.
But how do you know her?
l saw her last night.
- Night?
Where?
- ln the dancing school.
She dances really well.
- So?
So, l wanted to meet her.
- What for?
l wanted to ask her something.
- What did you want to ask her?
lf she'd..sort of..with me..
- What with you?
lf she'd work with me.
- What work?
l do plays, and l'm looking for
a dancer - You are doing a play.
Yes.
Are you a director?
- Yes. l'm sorry.
l'm sorry. Why
didn't you tell me before?
l did, when you asked me.
- l'm sorry. Come on in.
Actually, l'm a singer.
- l see.
l've done years of practice. Sit..
As it happens with
many great artistes..
..you don't really meet
too many connoisseurs.
You've met me today. You
don't know how lucky you are.
l know, sir but l've
come to meet Pooja.
Now that you have met me,
you'll meet Pooja, too.
l won't give you a
penny more than 75.
The prices have gone up, ma'am.
Rs.80, no less.
Only last week l bought it at..
..that price and the prices
have shot up within a week?
Trust me, ma'am.
That's the correct price.
You can taste for
yourself how sweet it is.
l will give you Rs.75 and no more.
- Seventy five..
Show me the watermelon.
- Here you are, sir. - Show..
Seventy-five is the right price.
How many do you want, Ma'am?
Just one.
- Pack this for Ma'am.
But..
- Oh, come on!
lt's your first sale in the day,
and you're haggling for five bucks?
Come on, give it
to ma'am. l'm there.
Hi.
- Hi.
Recognise me?
We met last night at
your dancing school.
Remember?
- Oh, yes.
l'm Rahul. You must've heard of me?
No.
Well, never mind. Actually
you are a pretty good dancer.
Thank you.
Actually, l'm doing
some musical shows..
..and l need a special
dancer for a special role.
When l saw you dancing yesterday..
..l thought that
you'd be ideal for this.
So what do you think?
Would you be interested?
No, thanks.
Rahul is done for.
Sir, watermelon!
My career's at stake here and all
you can think of is that watermelon.
Here, take this. Watermelon.
Excuse me, but perhaps
you misunderstand me.
The shows l'm talking
about are no ordinary shows.
Here l am.
They're high-class shows with
a very high-class audience..
..and l am sure you
would also enjoy doing it.
Why don't you give it a try?
Not for me, for the sake of art.
Dancing is my hobby.
- That's really good.
But dancing on stage in front
of an audience makes me nervous.
What's there to be nervous?
- l don't think l can do it.
No, no.
- l'm sorry.. - No problem. Just..
Take 3.
Excuse me. l'm sorry.
Look, l'm in a tight spot.
Actually, my lead dancer
has fractured her foot.
l've already
borrowed money for the show.
lf we don't perform, l'll not only
incur a loss but also lose face.
Just come once for a rehearsal,
and if you don't like it, it's fine.
But please, just once.
Please come to the rehearsal.
l'm really very sorry.
- Please - l can't do it.
Please.
- Why don't you hire someone else?
l beg of you, please.
- What are you doing?
You don't know me. l'm a
stubborn and crazy guy.
l'm not budging until you agree.
- Look. Please get up.
Please come just
once to a rehearsal.
Don't come back if you don't
want to. - Everyone's looking at us.
Please. Please come, just once!
Okay. l'll come. -You will?
Promise? - Promise.
When?
- Tomorrow. - What time?
2:00pm.
- Can't you come at one?
Okay, l'll come at one. - Thank you
very much. Thank you for all this.
By the way, l hope you know that..
..our rehearsal hall is right
next to your dancing school.
l know. - We're neighbours,
you know. - l know.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am.
You'll come, won't you?
Yes, you will.
Ma'am.
Yes.
For you. Yes.
He's crazy.
How is this sketch?
- No that good. This one's better.
Sir.
That's okay. But this one, this is
what l don't like. Make this proper.
l'll do that.
The colour scheme's okay. Okay.
But look at this one,
here, this one..
Rahul, you said that
girl would come at 1 :00pm..
lt's already 4:00pm. l
don't think she'll come.
So what should l do?
So if she doesn't come,
won't we do our play?
l was only..
- Go and get on with your own thing.
Go.
- Okay, relax.
What happened?
- Please, don't disturb me.
Quiet, quiet everybody.
Ballu, spotlight on the entrance.
Hi.
- Hi.
Rahul. You must've heard of me?
Cut it. No, no.
No, Pooja. No.
No, Pooja.
You're not putting
your heart into it.
You are concentrating
more on the steps and music.
l don't want to see
how well you dance.
l have already seen that,
and you are very good.
l want to see whether
you are Maya or not.
l want to see the zenith
of Maya's love and passion.
l want to see what happens
when Maya pours her heart out.
Right?
Okay. We'll try it once more.
All right, music.
Cut it!
Why don't you understand
what l'm trying to tell you?
Forget that there's
anyone sitting here.
Forget that there's music playing.
Forget that this is a rehearsal.
Just think of Maya.
God knows where you're lost.
l've cried myself hoarse that
l don't want to see your dance.
l don't want to see you dance.
l want to see your madness!
Maya's madness..
l'm sorry, Pooja.
- Don't touch me.
l'm really sorry, Pooja.
l was just..
Never in my life has
anyone yelled at me like that.
l know, Pooja. l'm an idiot.
l don't know how to talk to girls.
l told you l can't do it.
But you're doing it really well.
lt's just that l'm
going on about Maya.
l don't understand this Maya.
- Never mind..
l don't want to do this. - Don't
worry if you don't understand.
We don't have to do this today.
We can do it tomorrow. Okay?
l don't want to do it tomorrow
either. l'm not doing this. - Okay.
Maya, relax.
- My name is Pooja.
Of course, it's Pooja.
l'm sorry. Sit down, please. Sit
l'm really sorry, Pooja. Don't
dance if you don't want to..
..but please stop crying.
Don't want water? No problem.
You see Pooja, it's a habit
with me to yell during rehearsals.
l wasn't having a go at you.
l was only trying to explain
to you about Maya that's all.
Pooja, maybe you just
don't understand Maya.
Maya is the kind of girl..
..who lives in a dream world.
She believes that one day
her dream prince will come..
..and carry her away.
Her friends have
always made fun of her..
..but that did not shake her belief.
And today, she has met
the man of her dreams..
..and she's dancing.
There is love in her dance..
There's mad passion and arrogance.
As if to say, "l
knew he would come.."
"..and now, see, he has
come." "My dream man has come."
Music.
Wow, wonderful. - Brilliant.
- Brilliant. - Thank you.
lt was nice.
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
Nisha, l can't believe we got
such a good girl so quickly!
Had l not got the
right girl for this role..
..l'd have cancelled the play..
..given back the money, and
willingly faced the music.
But l was destined to meet Pooja.
Her name is Pooja?
- No, it's Jeetendra.
Of course it's Pooja.
ls she beautiful?
- Really beautiful.
Remember how l described Maya?
She's just like her.
That innocent face, those
dreamy eyes and that bashfulness.
She is too good,
Nisha. She's brilliant.
Yes.
ls she a good dancer?
When she dances, you
can't take your eyes off her.
l know that you will go
crazy when you see her.
l see.
- Yes.
But can she act?
But of course, she can. lf
she can't act, what am l for?
lf l can get you to act
l can get anyone to act.
Very funny.
There's no water, no soft drink
and you've called me for dinner.
Wait a minute, and l'll
get something to drink.
Rahul.
ls she as good a dancer as me?
Are you crazy? There's
no dancer as good as you.
Right.
- Right.
ldiot.
Can't even lie properly.
There go your pants.
The stitches gave away.
Hey Shruti, get my bag.
- Relax.
Let's go! -Okay, we'll push
off now. See you tomorrow..
Bye..
- See you tomorrow.
May l say something, Pooja?
- What?
When you smile..
- l know, l look good.
Then?
When you laugh, it rains.
Give it back.
"With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant."
"Oh, king of the rains,
where do you come from?"
"With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant."
"Oh, king of the rains,
where do you come from?"

"l know a girl, when she smiles.."
"l know a girl, when she smiles,
the rains come pouring down."
"l know a boy, when he sings.."
"l know a boy, when he sings,
the rain clouds mask the sky."
"The clouds have descended.."
"They stand in our path."
"Tell us what your
intentions are, oh clouds."
"Won't you let us go home?"
"There's rain ahead,
a storm behind."
"The weather is treacherous.
Oh, where can we go?"
"l know a girl, when she smiles,
the rains come pouring down."
"l know a boy, when he sings,
the rain clouds mask the sky."
"The heavy sky
stoops low with clouds."
"Everything has
come to a standstill."
"How lovely is this season."
"Take the sign of the rains."
"ln such a weather, say something.."
"..do something. Why
do you stand silent?"
"With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant."
"Oh king of the rains,
where do you come from?"
"With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant."
"Oh king of the rains,
where do you come from?"
"l know a girl, when she smiles,
the rains come pouring down."
"l know a boy, when he sings,
the rain clouds mask the sky."
The doctor has said clearly that
you can't go out of the house.
There's no need for you to
strain yourself trying to get up.
Now get into your bed, and rest.
Who are you calling now?
Rahul.
- Oh yes, he called..
..to say that he's at Soni's house.
At Soni's? Oh yes, Soni and
Jimmy are getting engaged today.
Aunt, get my clothes out quickly.
l want to go there. l'll just come.
Look, l'll call the doctor.
- Aunt, please!
She just won't listen.
"The girl is beautiful.."
"The boy looks morose.."
"The two don't match.."
"The two don't match.."
"They don't make a good pair.."
l'll not give this to you.
l hate these weddings.
l don't understand
why people get married.
lf two people have decided to
spend their whole lives together..
..why are the others
making such a fuss?
Why are they all getting excited?
These days it has become a fashion..
..to have seven days
long wedding celebrations.
Give me a break.
Get married, have a quiet ceremony,
and then go home and sleep.
l've even come to hate
the word 'marriage'.
Excuse me, may l have another one?
But the one good thing
is that in all this fuss..
..you get lots of goodies to eat.
Thank you. Have you eaten?
Later.
- Let's sit.
l really love weddings.
The small rituals, dancing,
singing, and making merry..
..l love every bit of it.
- Very good.
l'm going to have all
of them at my wedding.
Are you getting married?
Yes.
l mean, you never mentioned it.
When are you going to do it?
Actually, nothing is fixed yet.
He works abroad.
When he comes back..
..we'll fix a date when
we've found an auspicious time.
That's why l haven't
mentioned this to anyone.
l see. Congratulations.
Thanks.
Rahul, when are you
getting married to Nisha?
Nisha and me? Are you crazy?
The two of us are just good friends.
There's no chance of us
ever getting married..
..and in any case
marriage and me, no thank you.
Actually, l don't believe at all
in the institution of marriage.
l don't know how two people decide..
..to spend their whole
life with each other.
l fail to
understand and l'm certain..
..there can't be a girl who
could spend her whole life with me!
You're mistaken.
There is one such girl.
Where is she?
- Somewhere or the other.
Rubbish.
l've always believed that God
made all relationships of the heart.
But then He left it to
us to find each other.
He created all of us in pairs.
For every one of us
there is a soul-mate.
You just have to
wait till you meet her.
Do you think that's true?
At least in my life,
that's the ultimate truth.
True.
That means that you've
found your soul mate.
Yes. l've found him.
l found my soul mate.
Something is amiss.
- What?
The dessert is amazing. Have some.
- No.
Okay.
l don't know where he keeps it..
..Nisha! When were you discharged
from the hospital? - Hey, Ballu.
l ran away from hospital.
- Great.
Jimmy and Soni will be
delighted to see you.
Where are they? - They are sitting
in the lawn, go and meet them.
Rahul is there, isn't he?
- Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home.
Ballu.
- Coming. You go ahead.
"He has come, he has
come with a sword.."
Pooja.
Thanks. See you tomorrow.
Pooja.
- What?
lt's that story you
told me at Soni's.
That some special girl
is made for me..etc, etc..
l've been thinking about that.
l don't get something.
- What?
How would l know who's made for me?
You have so much
faith in this theory.
l'm sure you know how l'm
going to meet this girl.
l mean, will she be holding
a placard with my name on it?
Or, when l see her would
there be a clap of thunder..
..and a bolt of lightning?
Would music start playing?
What would happen?
He will tell you.
He will give just one sign..
..and your heart
would recognise the girl.

l've tried reasoning with her..
but she just wouldn't listen.
She does what she wants.
- Hi, Doctor.
Doctor.
- Rahul, good you came.
l'm fed up with this girl.
- Why? What happened?
l told her clearly that she
needs to stay at home to rest.
But look at her, she's
packing her bags to go somewhere.
Where to?
- How would l know?
l've tried my best to explain.
- She doesn't listen to me.
You're the only one
who could convince her.
Don't worry, she won't go anywhere.
l'll go in and take
her to task right away.
Okay? - Best of luck.
- Okay, see you. - Bye
Nisha.
What are you doing, Nisha?
Are you nuts?
The doctor told you to rest, right?
By the way, where are you off to?
l'm going to London.
- London?
Well, Mum and Dad keep calling me..
..and it's been
months since l met them.
l thought l'd visit them.
Besides, l want to
run away from here.
Want to run away? From whom?
From myself.
- What's all this nonsense, Nisha?
l've begun to get
scared of myself, Rahul.
l want to leave..
..so that l can avoid doing
things like the one l did yesterday.
Nisha, you haven't
done anything of the sort.
You were just dancing.
Look here..
- Rahul..
..now we should stop
evading the truth.
We both know what the problem is.
What's the problem?
The problem is that..
..l love you, and you don't love me.
Look here, Nisha..
- l know..
..that you know how much l love you.
That night l wasn't sozzled enough..
..to not hear what
my heart was saying.
Actually, Rahul, we've
become such good friends..
..that we take each
other for granted.
So l think that a bit of
space will give us time to think.
But l'm sure..
..that when l'm not here,
you'll miss me a lot.
Then maybe then
you'd realise my worth.
One thing is certain,
that an idiot like you..
..doesn't deserve a girl like me.
And l don't know why,
but l feel that..
.. when l come back..
..you'll be on your knees
begging me to get married to you.
And who knows at that point in
time l may not be in the mood for it.
Get lost.
Well, maybe you
haven't seen your face..
lt's better than yours.
Hey, Nisha..
- Rahul.
Nisha, you're really nice.
l know. Come on now..
l must meet everyone on
my way to the airport.
Come on, Rahul, hurry up.
We'll see you.
- Bye, see you guys.
Take care..
- l'll really miss you. - Thanks.
Bye.
- Enjoy yourself.
Take care.
- Bye, Nisha. - Bye buddy.
Rahul, has our stuff arrived?
Ballu is mad.
We haven't been properly introduced.
Let's start from the beginning.
Hi! l'm Nisha.
- l'm Pooja.
Now that we are friends..
..will you forgive me
for what l did yesterday?
Forgive you? For what?
Pooja, what l did with you
yesterday, wasn't right.
Actually, ever since
this place was built..
..l'm the only one
who's danced on this floor.
This floor has become my identity.
So when l heard that someone else
had taken my place.. l felt bad.
Without seeing you or
knowing you, l was jealous.
l shouldn't have felt that way.
Had l been in your place,
l'd have done the same.
Moreover, l really
enjoyed dancing with you.
You were the one dancing.
l was doing something else.
l'm really sorry, Pooja.
- lt's okay
Come on, Nisha. The pilot of
your flightjust called for you.
l always told Rahul that there could
never be another dancer like me.
But l can't say that any more.
And l'm sure that..
..no one can play the role
of Maya better than you.
Not even me. All the best..
Bye. See you.
- Thank you! Bye.
Come.
Who is coming to drop
me to the airport? - Me!
Hi. l'm Rahul.
You must have heard of me?
l'm looking for a special
dancer for a special role.
l saw you dance yesterday and
felt you would be ideal for this.
Check, check.. 69..
Ballu, what are you doing?
Throw the spotlight properly.
Pooja, good, good. But..
l think that you are not opening up.
l want to see how Maya
looks when she's happy.
l want to see the zenith of
Maya's passion and love. Okay?
Do it again. Okay.
Quiet everybody.
Take it from the top.
Music!
Cut it! Cut it!
Haven't l told you to
forget that you are you..
..to forget that there
are people sitting here?
Forget that there's a
rehearsal going on here.
But you refuse to understand.
Pack up.
l don't get one thing, Pooja.
How l would know which
girl was made for me?
Will she be holding a
placard with my name on it?
When l see her, would
there be a clap of thunder..
..and a flash of lightning?

"Oh dear, what's happening?
l don't really know."
"l only hope this does not
turn into a tale of love."
"Oh dear, what's going on?
Nobody really knows."
"But if this is a tale
of love, then so be it."
"Take my hand in yours,
as long as you are here."
"Let's sit talking,
as long as we can."
"Let's look into
each other's eyes.."
"..as long as the night lasts."
"Oh dear, what's going on?
Nobody really knows."
"How do l describe
the state of my heart?"
"Even the dewdrops seem to burn,
with the fever of my heart."
"Why do l feel as if
someone has caressed me"
"Oh dear, what's going on?"
"l don't really know."
"l only hope this does not
turn into a tale of love."
"Oh dear, what's going on?"
"Nobody really knows."
"But if this is a tale of love.."
"..then so be it."
"Please move away for a while,
so l can collect my feelings.."
"..and calm the
violent beating of my heart."
"Let's slow down so that we
don't move ahead of time."
"Oh dear, what's happening?
Nobody really knows."
"There is something
between us, don't deny it."
"And no one know
how far it would go."
"For you should know, your
heart is not what it was."
"Oh dear, what's going on?"
"l don't really know."
"l only hope.."
"..this does not turn
into a tale of love."
"Oh dear, what's going on?"
"l don't really know"
"l only hope this does not.."
"..turn into a tale of love."
l hope your uncle would be asleep
so l won't have to hear him sing.
Bye.
- Bye
Rahul, l forgot to tell you..
- What?
l can't attend rehearsal tomorrow.
- Why?
Tomorrow l'm going to Khandala.
- Khandala? Why?
My sister lives there.
- Which sister?
She's my dance teacher.
She taught me everything l know.
lt's her birthday tomorrow.
lf l say no, will you not go?
l'd go anyway, but ifyou
said yes, l'd go happily.
l'm joking. Go on. l'll look
into the otherjobs tomorrow.
Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.
Rahul's done for.
Rahul? What are you doing here?
- Hi.
l have a friend in Khandala.
He's been asking me over for ages..
..but l've never had a chance to go.
And since we can't
work without you..
..l thought l'd meet him,
and give you a ride too.
As it is you're going alone,
so l thought you'd have company.
What are you staring at?
Hurry up, hop in.
lf we go early we'll
beat the traffic. Come on.
Well, why are you smiling?
Nothing. Let's go.
Today l'm really
missing my friend. Really.
Tommy, Ceasar, quiet! Quiet!
- Pooja, l'm scared of dogs.
Pooja, Get them off me.
- They won't do anything.
Sister's taking a dance class there.
l'll just go and surprise her.
Stay here. Don't worry,
they won't bite you.
l'll be back.
- Sir Tommy, please.
Want some soft drink? You
can have these flowers too.
Sandhya, what are you doing?
l'll give you one now.
You've put on so much weight,
you can hardly move.
No more chocolates and ice creams
for you. Get it right this time.
Move the neck. Arms straight.
You..Why are you laughing?
Shut your mouth.
lf anyone gets it wrong then
no one will watch TV tonight.
Don't come begging me again,
please sister.
Please Sister, let me watch TV.
Look. There comes your dear Pooja.
Sister, how did you recognise me?
There's no need to act smart.
l know all my girls from
the sound of their footsteps.
Happy Birthday to you!
What's this? You've
brought me another ugly saree.
Yes, l chose the ugliest
l could get my hands on.
Thank you.
- Go on, class is over.
Where you are going?
The class isn't over yet.
Now l'm here, and the class is over.
You're spoiling them rotten.
They behave well all year round.
And the moment you step here,
they start misbehaving.
Sometimes one should be spoilt.
No! Sir Tommy, No!
- What happened?
Tommy, no! - Don't
let him go! Nab him!
Sister! Wait!
He's Rahul, my friend.
Your friend?
- Yes!
Leave him, girls.
- Come on, leave him.
Tommy, Ceasar, go inside. Go.
- Tommy went?
They're gone. Why
are you so frightened?
Hi! Happy Birthday!
Ok.
- Where are your feet?
What are you up to?
- l'm trying to touch your feet.
Do l look that old?
- Not at all but out of respect.
Give me your hand.
- Pardon me?
Your hand.
- Yes.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, you've caught a cold. Come,
let's go in. - Yes Pooja please.
Save me from the dogs.
- They won't hurt you.
You don't know. They're very
dangerous. - Sister, who's he?
l don't know but
l'll have to find out.
Pooja, you didn't
tell me what Rahul does.
Rahul? He directs plays.
These days, l'm working with him.
- l see.
l think that you don't
like Rahul specially.
No, l like him very much.
Very much?
No, l mean to say,
he's a good friend.
Good friend? You
mean you don't love him.
Sister, Rahul's just a friend.
A dear friend.
l see.. a dear friend.
lt's not what you think..
..and in any case, l
wanted to tell you something.
There's no need to tell me.
l understand everything.
Stop it, Sister. Sister,
you've got it all wrong.
Pooja. Pooja.
- Rahul. Rahul.
Pooja.
- Rahul, what's up? - Hi!
Hi!
- What's up?
Nothing. Why are you standing
with the spoon? Come join us.
Stupid!
- Hey everybody!
Come on everyone,
follow me.. this way.
Okay. Come on.
lf it's not love, then what is it?
Sister.. honestly!
- Look here, girl!
l've known you since you
were twelve years old.
What your heart doesn't
let you know, it tells me.
The look in your eyes says
that you love this boy very much.
Now stop lying to me.
Understood? Okay?
"Just a dear friend".
Listen, Sister..
"l can't recollect
when this happened."
"lt's become difficult to
hide this secret from everyone."
"lf you say so, today
l'll ask God for something."
"Oh dear, what's going on?
l don't really know."
"What this leads to..
- Let it become a romance."

So when is Ajay coming back?
Nothing is definite, but
he could come at any time.
Say D.
- D.
Say O.
- O.
Say N.
- N.
Say K.
- K. - Yes.
Now say E.
- E.
Say Y.
- Y. - l'll be right back.
Alright. Very good. Very good.
Let's start all over again.
D.
- D.
Okay, okay.
D. O. N.
- N.
K.
- Pooja, give me your hand. - Why?
l won't hit you! Give me your hand.
Here it is.
Here.
What's this?
- Hush.
Listen carefully to what
l'm going to tell you.
Ever since you were a child..
..you've always put
others before yourself.
l've always been
overwhelmed by your behavior.
But today this same
behaviour has made me sad.
But l..
- Quiet!
Sometimes, it's very important
to think of oneself, Pooja.
l see that you are
running away from your dreams.
You won't let them come true.
Don't do this, Pooja.
Not everybody is fortunate to
have their dreams come true.
Don't do this.
Let me tell you something. One
can fall in love many times.
True love only happens once.
The step you're unable to take..
..Lord Ganpati will help you.
He'll show you the right path.
He'll give you the
strength to fulfill your dreams.
Keep Him with you always.
l have faith in Him.
The Lord will set everything right.
l love you, Sister.
Stop it!
l don't want to make
a habit of crying.
Pooja!
No.
No way.
You are very fat. Sister will
scold me if l give this to you.
Why are you frightened?
- Pardon me?
Why are you frightened of
being in love? Tell her.
Love and me? l was just..
Okay, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Nice to meet you.
Take it!
What's this?
- This is, in a way, my blessing.
l'm very stingy in such matters.
l don't give my
blessing that easily.
But when l saw you l
thought that perhaps you need it.
This will help you to say
what you're unable to say.
Keep it very carefully.
You get it?
- Got it.
Bye.
- Bye. - She's on her way.
lf you can't say it, then
l'll say it.. - l'll say it.
Definitely?
- Definitely.
Okay.
- Okay.
Mark my words carefully.
Bye!
- Bye.
Bye!
- Good bye, Sister!
Bye!
- Bye, Sister!
Okay!
First, the bride. You can
drink straight from the bottle.
Okay. Here's to Soni and Jimmy.
Everyone together.
Cheers. For the most
beautiful couple l've seen.
And now l'm going to give a speech.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen..
May l have your attention, please?
Aunty, please.. thank you.
Since l am Jimmy's best man..
..it's my good
fortune to make a speech..
..and it's your misfortune
that you all have to listen to it.
Till today, l didn't understand
how two people can take a vow..
..to spend their entire
lives with each other.
l didn't believe in
these vows of marriage.
And seeing Jimmy and Soni together..
..only strengthened my conviction.
Because there can't be
anyone as innocent as Soni..
..and there can't be a
scamp to beat Jimmy.
l used to worry that Soni
and Jimmy are too different..
..to spend their lives together.
But today, l
realise that l was wrong.
l'm a little ashamed to admit..
..that l have
started believing in love.
The kind of love in
which lips don't speak..
..eyes do.
The kind of love that binds
two people together forever.
And today, l keep
thinking ofjust one thing.
l remember something..
..a very dear friend told me..
..about God..
..God has already
brought hearts together..
..but then He left the
hearts to find each other.
He made us all in pairs.
For every one of us, somewhere,
there's one soul mate just for us.
He made Soni for Jimmy.
Today, to that God..
..l give thanks for
bringing Jimmy and Soni together.
..and l pray that..
..He may give each one of us the
ability to recognise our soul mate.
Thank you.
My bangle?
Rahul, have you seen my bangle?
Darn! Now l'm sure l won't find it.
lt was my favourite bangle.
- Mine, too.
Rahul!
Come on, give it to me.
Come here and take it.
What childish behavior!
Give it to me!
Come closer.
Here goes.. happy?
Come closer.
Rahul!
- Closer..
Stop it!
Closer..

"How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something."

wavering hearts came together."
"Oh, my love."

Careful. Hey, Suppandi, watch
the scenery. Jimmy, watch Soni.
What's up, Supandi? Tell me.
Oh.
- l'm coming. l'm coming.
Just do this for me.
How much do l work tell me?
- Keep this on top.
Take it. - Where's Pooja?
She's nowhere to be seen.
Rahul!
The set is ready.
Good, well done.
Call Pooja.
- Okay.
Shruti. Call Pooja.
- Yes!
Pooja, we're ready.
Are you angry with me?
- Not at all.
Then why aren't you speaking to me?
l am speaking to you.
For three days, l haven't seen
your face or heard your voice.
l was very busy.
l have been calling you everyday.
Why haven't you been answering?
The phone has been out
of order for some time.
What is the problem?
Tell me. l want to know the
cause ofyour restlessness.
There's no problem.
- There is a problem.
Serious problem.
The fact is that we both
love each other very much.
We can't tell each other about it.
Today, l've come here to tell you..
..that l love you.
l love you very much.
And l know that you also love me.
So then, say it once..
..and that will be the
end of your restlessness.
Everything will be all right.
l don't love you.
- You're lying.
l'm not lying.
- You aren't?
Look into my eyes and tell me..
..that we weren't
made for each other.
We weren't.
Tell me that when l leave you,
you don't turn to look at me.
l don't.
Tell me that nothing
happens to you when l touch you.
Nothing.
- Tell me..
..that you don't want to
come into my arms right now.
l don't.
Look into my eyes just once..
..and tell me that
you don't love me.
l don't..
"For each other."
- l don't..
l don't..
Terrific performance!
Very well done!
Excellent!
Fabulous Rahul! Wonderful.
Fantastic. - Thank you, buddy.
Rahul, there was no problem
with my lighting, was there?
Soni, l'd told you.
- Nisha!
Nisha. ?Let's go and give
her a warm welcome. - Welcome.
Hi.
- Hi! Great to see you back again.
Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, Raju, l'd told you
she'd come back soon. - Hi.
'But l'm sure that
when l'm not here..'
'..you'll remember me often..'
'..and l don't know why,
but when l get back..'
'..you'll be on your knees
begging me to marry you.'
'And then perhaps l may not
be in the mood for marrying.'
Well, l'll be off.
l'm a little tired.
l'll see you all tomorrow.
Okay. As you wish.
- Bye.
What's up with Nisha?
- She's tired. She'll come tomorrow.
Don't get unnecessarily worried.
l'm not a nice girl, Rahul.
l'm bad.
l'm really bad.
No Nisha, you're my friend.
And no friend of mine is bad.
No, Rahul, you don't know..
..that l'm not a nice girl.
Now you see..
..l love a boy..
..and have always loved him..
..and today l realised
that he doesn't love me.
He loves someone else.
l feel bad..
l'm hurt..
l'm upset. l feel jealous.
Rahul, l shouldn't feel like this.
l'm bad.
l'm very bad.
No, Nisha..
- No, Rahul.
Actually, that boy
isn'tjust the one l love..
..but he's also my best friend.
Today, for the first time,
l saw love in his eyes.
l couldn't bring that
love in all these years..
..but that other girl has.
Perhaps they are
made for each other.
Perhaps l was never meant for him.
Perhaps her love for him is true.
So you see, l should
be happy for my friend.
l should revel in his happiness.
But l'm not happy.. l'm not!
l'm very bad..
..really very bad.
Nisha, you're not bad..
..you're really nice.
You know who is bad?
He is bad..
The One who plays
around with us mortals..
..making A love B..
..while B loves C..
..and C loves D..
l don't know why He does this.
When He makes one
person love another..
..He ought to make sure that the
other one also loves her in return.
Right?
But that's not what He does.
He's really bad.
You're not bad.
He's bad.
You're right.. lt's He who's bad.
He's bad!
You're bad. l'm not.
You're bad. l haven't
done anything wrong.
You are the one.
You are bad. You are bad.
l'm not bad.
l'm not bad.
- l'm sorry, Nisha.
Don't say sorry, Rahul.
Else, l'll cry.
l'm sorry, Nisha.
- Don't say sorry, l'll cry.
Sorry.
No, Rahul, don't say sorry.
l'll break down.
Rahul!
Ajay..
..when l was a little girl, you
used to tease me about my dreams.
When l used to tell you that l am
looking for the one meant for me..
..you would say that
l am crazy and silly.
You'd say that when l grow up..
..my dreams will vanish.
But you know, l have grown up..
..and my dreams have not vanished.
They have grown with me.
That day, at the airport, when you
suddenly asked me to marry you..
..at first l didn't
realise what l should do.
Then l saw you going.
But then l thought, l was crazy..
..you were my dearest friend..
..and the one who knew me the most.
Who could be better for me?
And l was standing
lost in my thoughts.
You left, and silly me
made you a part of my dreams.
l started believing that
you were the one made for me.
And then..
..and then l met Rahul.
You're marrying Pooja?
What are you saying Ajay?
But Pooja hasn't said
anything to me about it.
l had forbidden
her from telling you.
l wanted to tell you myself.
Oh, God! l can hardly believe you!
l'm so happy! When are you coming?
l called just to tell you this.
l'm coming tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
What can l tell you about Rahul?
Where do l begin?
Well, you should realise that
l've never met anyone like him.
Sometimes he's an angel,
sometimes a devil.
Sometimes crazy..
and sometimes a genius.
Sometimes he scolds so harshly..
..and sometimes he makes
funny faces to make me laugh.
At times he's more
stubborn than a child..
..and at times he's
a beloved companion.
ln three days? Oh, no.
l want time to get things
ready for a big wedding.
Mom, l don't have time.
The company's sending
me to Japan for a year.
You'll have to wait for eight
to ten months. Think about it.
l can't wait that long.
All right, you come here, and
l'll start the preparations.
The dreams of your crazy
girl have come true, Ajay.
She's found the
partner of her dreams..
..and she wants to know whether..
..she can make all
her dreams come true.
Can she make her dreams come true?
Ajay phoned just now.
He's told me everything.
He's coming tomorrow, Pooja..
..and he says to get the wedding
organised as quickly as possible.
You're a silly goose. You would
tell me your smallest secrets..
..and you hid such
a big one from me?
Come here..
..sit by my side.
You know, Pooja, ever
since you came to this house..
..l've had a dream in which..
..one day, you'd
become my daughter-in-law..
..and l, your mother.
But l was afraid..
..of how you two would
be when you grew up.
Whether you would be friends.
Whether you'd take a
liking to each other.
Hence, l never
revealed my heart's desire.
l also wanted that..
..you should decide, if
at all you wanted it..
..but not for my sake.
l wanted you to choose Ajay
out ofyour own free will.
You don't know how
happy l am, for l know..
..that there cannot
be a better girl..
..than you for my son.
Just watch. l'm going to
give you a grand wedding.
You have no idea how happy l am.
May you live long.
l want full lights
and l want to see..
..M6 on both left
and right of stage.
Suppandi, in a while l
want to hear the music tracks.
Soni, the elevation
should be three feet higher..
..or else the audience on stage
right will not know what is going on.
When Ballu lights M6, one spot
light will filter here on this side..
..and the audience gets a glimpse
of the entry before it happens.
Rahul.
- Hi Pooja.
You just make sure
this doesn't happen.
l want them in complete..
- Rahul.
Sure. Sure.
- l'll take care of it. - Yes.
l need to talk to you.
The show opens in two days,
we'll talk later.
Shruti. Soni, you just take
care of this. l'll see you.
Hello.
Show me all the costumes of
act three's dream sequence.
Always sitting with Soni. Never
does any work. - That's not so.
All are approved?
- Yes, this one's approved.
Yes.
- Trials done? - Yes. - Rahul.
Yes.
- Rahul, l have to talk to you.
Pooja, just a minute. l'll
just finish this.. - But..
One minute. One minute.
Shruti. Shruti, pay attention here.
Okay.. tell me
what's the problem? Shoot.
Rahul, please try and understand
what l am about to tell you.
Rahul, Nisha's calling you. There's
a call from the auditorium. - Darn.
l forgot to talk to her.
l'll be right back.
Supandi you come with me.. - Rahul.
Where's Nisha?
Rahul, please be serious..
Ajay?
My name is Ajay, but ifyou
like you can call me Rahul.
Fatso! l love you!
- Nisha, you'd said..
l really missed you.
Remember Pooja, l told you that
l'd come to get you anytime any day?
Here l am.
l came here after
meeting mom. She is so elated.
Hey, l hope you
haven't changed your mind.
You're marrying me, aren't you?
Have you told your friends?
l was going to.. - Hear that!
l'll have to do that, too?
Come on. l'll tell them all
that we are getting married.
Ladies and gentlemen.. l'm
sorry for the intrusion.
You don't know my name. lt's Ajay.
l'm Pooja's childhood friend.
And since she hasn't
found a worthy guy..
..l took pity on her,
and l'm going to marry her.
Congratulations! - Alright, okay.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Thank you. Okay, okay.
ln three days,
we're getting married.
..and you all must come,
with family.
Okay. Definitely.
- We'll all come.
Rahul!
Pooja, you're weird. Why
didn't you tell us before?
We had begun to feel
that you were our Maya.
We forgot you're Pooja, and
you have your own private life..
..and your own relationships
and even prior commitments.
We are really stupid!
Oh, l forgot..
Pooja, congratulations.
Thanks.
- And this is..
This is Rahul, our director.
Rahul, she likes your name a lot.
She likes only the name?
- l hope so, man!
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Rahul, l have a request.
- Go on.
May l take her away for an hour?
- Oh, come on!
You're taking her
away forever from us.
That will be in a
ceremonious way. What say, Pooja?
This is just a lunch date with
Pooja. Do l have your permission?
My permission!
Now l'll have to get your
permission to meet Pooja.
Besides, now that you've come..
..Pooja won't be happy here,
will you Pooja?
So, go on. l'll get by without you.
Are you sure?
- Yes, of course! Absolutely!
You guys go, and
have a good time. Go on.
We have his permission.. let's go.
- Go on.
Okay guys.
- Okay, see you.
Bye. After three days, okay?
- We'll be there.
Ballu, show me the final mix.
Shruti, show me the sketches.
And Nisha, call up the
auditorium and tell them..
The thing is that..
..in two days we're
going on stage.. - Rahul!
Lights! why aren't you
showing me the lights.
There are just two days,
and you're taking it easy!
Come on, the lights.
Shruti, show me the sketches.
Quickly bring the
sketches here, fast!
Tania, hurry up with the band.
We've got to finish the
music rehearsals, too!
Come on, everybody.
Faster everybody. Come on.
This is our last meeting.
l'm getting married tomorrow.
l don't want to meet you
ever again after today.
Just assume that l was
never a part of your life.
As soon as l start to move,
track me with the spotlight..
..and the other will stay on Pooja.
When l get right
up to the audience..
..then slowly dim the light.
The show will be over..
The End.
That's it.
Any questions?
l don't want any mistakes, okay?
- Okay!
Raj, everything all right?
- Yes.
Okay then, tomorrow be
at the stadium on time.
Pack up?
- l'll take that. - All Right.
Hey, Rahul. Something
is bothering me. - What?
l don't like the end of your story.
- Why?
This ending's too sad.
A love story should
always have a happy ending.
The audience should
come out smiling, right?
People like to
live in a dream world.
They have seen many dreams..
..now let them see a little reality.
Every love story is
like this in real life.
Full of sorrow and pain.
No, Nisha. This ending
is absolutely right.
There can't be another
end to this love story.

"l know a girl, when she smiles.."
"..it rains."
"l know a boy, when he sings.."
"..it rains."
Jimmy, just go and check the
next entry stage left. - Okay.
The heart is crazy,
just refuses to listen.
"Oh dear, what's going on?
l don't really know."
"l only hope this does
not turn into a romance."
"Oh dear, what's going on?
l don't really know."
"But if this is a romance,
then so be it."
Pooja's last entry is after this.
Get her ready, and bring her here.
Don't worry. Nisha's getting
her ready, and bringing her.
Thanks.
Don't make this mistake, Pooja.
Very few people are lucky..
..enough to love and to be loved.
You can't break the tie
which He has ordained.
You can't break it.
l've spent my years giving
love the name of friendship.
Now, you're going to
spend the rest of your life..
..giving
friendship the name of love.
This is a betrayal!
A betrayal of love.. a
betrayal of friendship.
Don't do such a thing!
This is our last meeting.
l'm getting married tomorrow.
l don't want to meet you
ever again after today.
Just assume that l was
never a part of your life.
l want to ask you
something before l go.
Did you ever love me..
..even for a single
day or a single moment?
This line is not in the play.
- Raju!
Tell me just once..
..have you ever really
loved me? Even for a moment?
What is Rahul saying?
- Shut up.
l won't leave without an
answer to this question.
l'm not going!
Did you ever love me,
even for a single moment?
No.
- What did you say?
l didn't hear that.
No.
- Speak up, l couldn't hear.
No.
- Louder, louder Pooja..
No, l've never loved you.
Not for a day, not for a moment.
Never.
That is all l wanted to hear.
Rahul.. you'll
remember my name, won't you?
What can l tell you about Rahul?
Where do l begin?
Well, you should realise that
l've never met anyone like him.
Sometimes he's an angel,
sometimes, a devil.
Sometimes he's crazy,
sometimes he's a genius.
Sometimes, he scolds so harshly..
..and sometimes he makes
funny faces and makes me laugh.
At times he's more
stubborn than a child..
..and at times he's
a beloved companion.
What he is or is not, l
cannot really express in words..
..but l don't know why,
l feel that..
..when he looks at me,
l feel beautiful.
When he laughs, l feel like dancing.
When he's upset, l feel
like holding him in my arms.
When he loves me, my
eyes fill with tears.
He's made me realise..
..that l am made for him..
and he for me.
l love him very much..
..not for one day or one moment..
..but for my whole life.
l love you, Rahul. l love you.
Yes.
Rahul!
Now that l've seen them, l
believe that someone, somewhere..
..was made for me as well.
lsn't that so?
- Yes.
My name is Ajay. Yours?
l'm Nisha.
- Nisha!
Are you married?
- What?
"The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted."
"lt brings along sleepless nights.
lt steals sleep and solace."
"lt shows them the path of love."
"lt brings joy and tears."
"The heart is crazy."
"The heart is besotted."
"The heart is crazy."
"The heart is besotted."
"The heart is crazy,
the heart is besotted."
