It is one year since 
the avalanche in Geiranger -
- that caused a 80 meter tall tsunami.
248 lives were lost in that brutal
encounter with the natural forces.
We have heard strong stories
of courage, care and goodwill.
But also questions about what
we as a society could do -
- to prevent such disasters.
And if something similar can happen again.
This week, the Geiranger Commission
presented its report.
Head and senior researcher in Norsar,
Johannes Løberg, welcome.
How do you approach this as a researcher?
- To find meaning and answers
after such an event?
When natural forces hit us,
they hit randomly.
Unfortunately, no one can anticipate -
- exactly when or where
an earthquake will occur.
Especially such a small tremor which
triggered the avalanche in Geiranger.
Knowing that, should people
be living there at all?
That is a difficult question.
But it is useless to live in constant fear.
Because we can't control nature.
In any case we live in the middle of it.
Løberg, we are not here alone.
We invited a man -
- who has rightly been called
a hero after this tragedy.
- Ready?
- Before he comes, let's see some pictures.
Good luck.
Many of those who were in
Geiranger on May 6th last year -
- can thank one man for being alive today.
Please welcome
geologist Kristian Eikjord.

Hello.
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
- Did you forget me?
- Forget you? Are you crazy? No I...
It's good to see you.
- Should I take it?
- Yes.
- You're probably hungry.
- Yes a bit.
I haven't been to the shop, but ...
- Omelette?
- Yes.
- Omelette and crackerbread?
- That's fine.
- How is everything at home?
Have you got a boyfriend?
No.
- Have you?
- Me? No, no.
Do you miss mom?
Yes, sometimes.
Things might have been better by now?
Maybe.

I'm fine here now.
Come, please.
Julia, please. Come.
What is this?
Just something I'm dealing with.
What?
It's getting late.
Come, let's go down.
- I don't understand why you have all this.
- It's impossible for you to understand.
So many died there.
So many we knew.
So many ...
You saved mom and Sondre.
You saved me.
Come. Let's go down.
Good morning.
I made breakfast.
Cracker bread with cheese and peppers.
And I heated up yesterdays coffee.
I've also tidied.
I think it's best that you leave.
- Leave? Why?
- You're a big girl now.
You know I can't
have visitors right now.
I thought I was staying till Thursday?
I think it's best for you,
and daddy, that you go home now.
- I have a ticket.
- Let's pack. Come on.

 The cause of the accident
is still unknown. 
 The police informed early
about this serious accident. 
 It quickly became clear that
two people have lost their lives. 
 The Oslofjord tunnel is
now closed in both directions. 
 It is unclear when it reopens. 
 There are 32 subsea tunnels in Norway - 
 - with even steeper rise 
than the Oslofjord tunnel. 
 Many people have criticized the
slope in the tunnel to be too steep. 
 We have now verified the
identity of the two deceased. 
 They are Inga Hansen and Konrad Lindblom.
Their next of kin have been notified. 
 Lindblom worked as
a geologist for Norsar. 
 He should not have been involved
in the tunnel construction work. 
 Our reporter Mats Andersen was
at the spot shortly after the event. 
 The Oslofjord tunnel has been hit by ... 
 We can't get into the tunnel,
but have been informed by the police that - 
 two people died in the tunnel
after something fell from the ceiling. 
Kristian!
Hello.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
Beard and all.
Almost didn't recognise you.
- Coffee?
- Yes please, if you have.
- Ingrid, do you have those copies for us?
- Yes, here you go.
I've gone through everything you requested.
- Nothing detected on any of them?
- No.
Not a bad word about Konrad.
He was a good man.
But he could ...
Sometimes go a little too
far with alternative theories.
We've never had such
precise measurements as we have now.
A level of detail that we
could only dream of before.
- Fetch the 3.8 from Bergen last year.
- Yes, let's see.
Look at that.
There were more movements
detected that day?
No, yellow dots are man-made tremors.
Construction work and blasting.
Only red are confirmed earthquakes.
So, Norway will be ok.
And if anything,
Ingrid will be sitting here watching.
We were watching in Geiranger too.
Yes. But, Kristian, we can't
measure a tremor before it happens.
Hello?
- Hello?
- In here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
My name is Kristian Eikjord.
I worked with Konrad.
Yes.
Then you know he is dead?
Of course. Are you family?
Konrad is my dad.
Or was my dad.
I'm so sorry.
My condolences.
- But you worked together?
- Yes, or ... yes.
Konrad was a friend.
He contacted me.
I didn't think Dad had any friends.
Maybe more of a colleague
than a friend then.
I'm interested in his work.
I need to see some papers and ...
Take a look inside the office.
I have a meeting with the funeral agency.
- It is okay?
- Yes, yes. It's going out anyway.
Thank you.
Hello. This is Marit.
Correct. Small wooden house.
Next to a big yellow one.
Ok. But I'm here.
Fuck me!
Hi, Kristian.
How do we know that
the yellow dots are not really red?
How do we know what is created
by man or by nature?
As I said, this is
construction work and blasting.
- Yes, but how do we know?
-  Contractors report it. 
- They report any blasting?
 -They report projects. 
So the contractor reports
for the entire building period?
Yes, in principle.
Any construction work going
on in the Oslofjord tunnel?
- Call that contractor.
- Kristian, it will be a little ...
Please? Do me that favour,
then I'll stop bothering you.
 If there was no 
construction work there that day ... 
... what was it then?
 -I'll make some calls, ok? 
- Thank you.
- Hi, Sondre.
- Hi Dad.
Ssay hello to Mia,
my girlfriend.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Lucky to meet you here.
- I live here.
Of course.
- Are you on your way, or?
- Yes, we're going to the cinema.
- Maybe we'll talk later, then?
- Yes.
Nice to meet you.

- Hi.
- Hi.
- You look good.
- Thanks.
You too.
- And Julia?
- She actually gone to bed.
She forgot this.
She has a dry run
in the opera tomorrow.
What? Is she singing?
She dances the ballet.
You can come and watch.
Do you want to?
- If you have time?
- Of course.
She will be happy.
It was very bad what happened
to Julia in Geiranger.
We both know that it's
a bit difficult for me now.
Looks lovely to lay on the back
and have a little breakdown.
You should try it, it's pretty nice.
Idun?
What I'm going to tell now,
is going to sound completely insane.
I don't want you to be afraid.
Okay, it's an old building,
but it's the second time in a week.
It looks okay.
A little hot, maybe.
Please hold it.
Can I get some light?
Hello?
Can I get some light, Kristian?

What do we do?
Idun, it's fine.
It's not okay.
I understand why you left me.
What I tried to ...
Kristian. It wasn't me who left you.
You left us.
- Hi.
- Hello! It will be fun to see.
Mom? What time will Dad come today?
I don't know when,
but he knows when it starts.
Dad is coming to watch today.
- Are you excited?
- Good luck!
- Hello? Hello?
- I'm in here.
- What are you doing?
- Your father was doing something important.
I have to lock up and get going.
Have you ever had a feeling that something
is about to happen, but you don't know what?
I grew up with a father
who always had that feeling.
He couldn't drive past a rock
slide without taking some home.
Have you read it?
But he missed it.
Yes. He might have missed the timing.
He was right in that if
a tremor hits Oslo today,
- let's say not the same strength
as in 1904, let's say 6.
Or 8. 
Not double the strength.
It's a million times stronger.
Thousands will die.
I must move on.
You found what you were looking for?
- Take what you want.
- It can be tough for you to hear.
But there are things that
are more important than a daughter.
A son. A family.
Okay.
Nevertheless, I have to leave.
I have to choose hymns
for my dads funeral.
Because he was doing something
important down the Oslofjord tunnel.
Do you know why I think he was there?
- No.
- Because he wanted to save you.
- You and many others.
- I need to see that tunnel.
I'm not going down that tunnel.
Don't you wonder what
he was doing down there?
This is important.
Of course.
Can we not just go?
Wait.
Hold this.
Can I have some light here?
- Kristian!
- Coming soon.

- Hi, Idun.
- Hi. Where did you go?
- I'm so sorry.
 - Are you coming? 
I was on my way, then something
happened so I was delayed.
- Okay? Are you far away?
- I ...
<I> Kristian? Are you there? Hello? 
Are you there? Hello?!
Can you hear me talking to you now?
- I can hear you.
- Are you coming or not?
- We are on our way. 
- What?

<I> Hello? Idun? 
Do you hear me? Idun? Hello?


Julia!
Julia!
Idun?
Kristian ...
- Hi! Have you seen Julia?
- I think she's up there.
- Hi, can't be here now!
- Julia!
- Have you seen my daughter?
- You must go out!
I'm looking for my girl!
She is in the show.
Listen to what I'm saying.
Nobody's here. Everyone has gone out.
It's not safe to be here now.
You have to get out.
Julia?

Hello. Are you ok?
Are you okay?
My girl. Come on.
We have to get out.
- Where is Dad?
- He didn't come. It'll be fine.
We have to get out. Come on, my girl.
Come on, you're fine.
Come to me.
Come. There you go.


- Hello? Idun?
 - We are heading home. Just come. 
- I will be there right away.
 - Good. 
- Johannes. It was a quake, right?
- What are you doing here?
They contacted you.
It was an earthquake, right?
There has been a movement,
and that's what we're going to figure out now.
A movement?
You see what's going on here now?
I have to do my job now.
Hi!
That is Oslo.
Do you know what Konrad was doing in the tunnel?
He took rock samples.
That's the rock test he did not get done.
Just give me a minute.
Kristian, that stone.
It proves nothing.
We know from before that the mountain
around the Oslofjord tunnel is not strong.
Falling rocks in the Oslofjord tunnel
does not mean that an earthquake is coming.
It's just another accident in Norway's
most accidentally burdened tunnel.
Johannes, your yellow dots ...
The tremors are hidden behind the blasts.
The blasts are just camouflage.
See.
Look at that column.
It's not about blasting or camouflage.
It's about construction error.
The movement we recorded was created
by the Opera itself as it collapsed.
Had there been a tremble,
we wouldn't be standing here, any of us.
The whole of Bjørvika is built on marine clay.
It's like jelly in a kids party.
A little puff in one corner,
and all of it would be shaking.
You have a power failure. You have...
There may be a thousand
reasons for a power failure.
I know it's not easy.
You've been in the midst of a disaster.
I can not imagine what you've been through.
But that does not mean there
are accidents wherever you are.
Can you please go now?
Kristian! What is going on?
Go home.
 ... a construction error in one
of the pillars can have many reasons. 
 This is where we want
to investigate carefully. 
 It became very dramatic for the
young people gathered at the Oslo Opera 
Where did you go?
Why did not you come?
Pardon.
Sorry.
But I'm here now.
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
What do you want?
I don't quite know.
My God. I'm looking for
disasters everywhere ...
We miss you.
Can't you at least try to a dad?
- Idun, you don't understand ...
- What do I not understand?
What I do not understand?
I was in Geiranger too.
You did everything you could, Kristian.
You saved a lot of people.
Your family survived.
We were lucky.
We are here. All together.
So your system has detected
that the power went in the Opera 20:05:18?
And the accident itself happened
a few seconds later, say 20:05:30?
Nice, thank you.
Talk to you later. Bye.
Can you give me time for the
movement in the Opera yesterday?
It is registered at 20:04:57.
Yes.
Oi! Shit! I just stepped in some water.
Okay. Yes.
I am on my way now. I'll look at it.
I'm completely drenched.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you ready for this, Dad?
Whole family package ...?
I hope so.
- So you'll stay a while?
- I hope so.
Yes, that's good.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the university.
- Now?
- Yes.
- Do you want some food?
- No, I have. Good bye.
Good bye.
Are you and mom together now?
To be honest, I don't know.

- Hi.
- Hi. I've to show you something.
Yes, the whole business.
Explosions and all large construction work.
In the entire Oslo area.
No, there is no need to worry.
We are studying urgently.
Thanks for that.
Johannes? Look at this.
It looks like a kind of system.
A warning system.
Gas.
- It's gas that kills those rats!
- Gas?
- A limnic eruption.
- Hi.
What kind of eruption?
Toxic gases that leak out
of the pores of a mountain.
Lake Nyos in Cameroon, 1986.
Gas? I thought it was
earthquakes you were afraid of?
Yes, that's what I'm afraid of.
And that's what's happening now.
Go get dressed now!
Nausea is a physiological
process where we repel ...

On with the belt. We're gonna get mom.
Answer, damnit!
What? Tell.
Come on, Idun.
I don't know what to say.
Wasn't he out of it for the autumn holiday?
Has he become normal again now?
Right now he is.
Yes. What happens next time 
he's gets weird?
Hello. That's fine.
Just drive. 
Drive!
Close cultures like England and Norway ...
- You. Again?
- Sorry.
Read it out if it's so important.
Where were we?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Why are we driving so fast?
 - Police Emergency. 
I have placed four bombs
at the university.
- They blow up in ten minutes.
 - In the university? 
- Left here!
- I can't.
Dad, wait.
- I will be back soon.
- Don't go.
I will be back soon. I promise.
I'm just gonna get mom.
You stay here with Marit.
Can you promise? Please?
- Marit? Watch out for Julia!
- Daddy!
That is correct. Hello.
I'll take a look at it.
Can I call you back?
Idun Eikjord. I've to talk to her now.
There has been an accident.
- Where is she?
- Idun?
- I think she's on 34.
- 34?
- 34th floor.
- To hell with this.
Inner most elevator
and all the way up.

Hi, Kristian.
Haven't you seen anything on the screens yet?
You'll see some big movements soon.
- If we aren't prepared ...
- We have already ... 
Call someone.
Start warning people.

- We must talk afterwards. 
- There will be no afterwards.
Call some agencies. I don't know.
Turn on the air raid siren. Johannes?
... metaphorically speaking correctly,
and then the dating process is ...

Mia, we gotta get out.
Now. I have a very bad feeling.
Wait.
Perhaps we'll leave the scene?
Yes, okay. Note the metaphors used
on the animals that are hunting ...

- Move. I'm delivering goods.
- Can't you just drive past me?
I can move.
Julia?
Julia?
Julia! Julia!
Give me two seconds.
- Hi.
- You have to come. Everyone must get out.
- There's an earthquake. Now!
- Kristian, please calm down.
We can't be here.
It's the worst place to be! Come now.
Kristian, calm down.
If there was an earthquake,
someone would know about it and alert.
There is no one who alerts. Come!
I'll come with, and then we'll
have a cup of coffee and talk together. Ok?
Sorry everyone.
Sorry, everybody must
leave the building now!
Are you aware how
much a fake alarm costs?
Julia!
Press the fire alarm. The elevator will
automatically go down to the ground floor.
What is Julia doing here?
- An interesting transformation ...
- Come on, we're going out.
- What?
- You? I've had enough of you.
- The alarm went off, so if everyone just go out.
- The alarm has stopped.
Sit down or leave.
- You should all come.
- Sit down or just get lost.
Everybody leave calmly.
Keep calm and walk to the stairs.

No coverage?

Hello?
Johannes?

Down!
Julia!
Idun.
Idun? Idun?
Are you okay?
Look at me.
Look at me.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Say something! Please.
Idun?

Julia!
Hello. Can you hear me?
Are you okay, Julia?

Can you grab this?
And then pull.
Okay, on three.
Can you pull?
One. Two. Three!
Pull!

Julia! Julia!
We are going to make it.
But we have to do it together.
Both of us.
There is an opening down there.
Are you okay?
Hold here. 
Press as hard as you can.

Julia, run up there!
As fast as you can! Run!
Hold on
No!
Grab something!
Julia!

Idun? Idun! Move!
Idun?
Can you move?
There will be aftershocks,
so we have to get away from here.
First we need to
get down and out.
Then we'll get Julia.

- Okay.
- No.
Idun?
Idun? Get up.
Then I will send this one over.
You can do it. Come on.
I'll catch you.
Julia is waiting up there. Come on.
Come on. Get up.
Come on. There you go.
Very good.

I'll let go, you catch.

Just hold on.
I'll catch. Come on.
Hold on
Climb up a little.
Just a little, I'll catch you.
- Kristian ...
- Come on!
Come on.
I can't.
Please? Please?
I love you.
Don't say that. Please.
Just a little more.
- You have to pick up Julia.
- Idun! No!
Now climb up! A little bit!
Then I'll catch you.
Do you hear what I'm saying?
A few centimeters, then I'll catch you.
Please?
Just a little more.
There, yes! Come! Come!
Help!
Help!
- Marit?
- We're down here!
- Julia!
- Daddy!
She is here! Help!
I'm coming!
Dad!
I thought I had lost you.
Let me look at you.
Where is Mommy?
Where is Mommy?
I'm so sorry.
You must not go.
Look at me. I'll be here.
I promise.
Thanks.
Now, listen to me.
We must get away from here. Ok?
Come.

- No!
- Julia!
Julia!
Julia!

Dad!
Julia!
Dad!
- Daddy!
- Julia! Stay completely still!
Julia! Don't move.
- Marit! Go down!
- I'm coming!
Dad!
Marit!
Marit!
- I need you to take Julia.
- Yes.
I'm going to swing her over.
Are you ready?
Julia, I'm going to swing you over.
I'll count to three.
One two...
...three.
- Drop! Julia, you have to let go.
I'm holding you, Julia.
You have to let me go now.
- Julia, drop daddy!
- Let me go.
