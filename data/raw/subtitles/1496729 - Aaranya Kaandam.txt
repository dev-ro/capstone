NagaDutta : Vishnugupta, what is dharma?
Vishnugupta Chankya : Dharma is doing what is necessary
Today
(Subbu) Please don't hit me because it isn't working
(Singaperumal/Ayya) Cunt-hair
Yo Chittu, you continue..
(Chittu) It's a simple matter
Say you are in a train..
And you see a MILF
You start the conversation by playing with the kid
Where ever you start, it's always gonna end in 2 topics
Politics and cinema
You start with a recent movie. From there you keep it going
Now, you ask the most important question
'You like Rajini or Kamal?'
Machi, that's the main matter.
That's how gotten with many MILFs
If they like Rajini, let them be
But if the like Kamal...
We can easily work those flirts
Why is that?
He looks sexy to them
That's it.
You can work them even if you don't know them
If you know them?
Then, ask if they are married
If you know them, why ask?
That's how they find out you are interested
Machi......
You can seduce any MILF in 4 steps
You can just sweet talk...
...Make them laugh...
... or just get them crying and work from there
Gimme an example
Ask if they are married..
If she likes you....
...she will reply 'No'
...with a smile
But if she replies 'Yes'...
Ask 'Are you actually happy?'
Some hoes will reply....
...'Nothing's wrong. I am very happy'...
That's when you don't give up..
You ask 'Do you really think this will last?'
'The man doesn't give a shit already'
.. and start some rumors about him.
Then what....
plenty of tears..
consoling her...
and 'matter' (sex)
- If she doesn't cry?
-Then I will cry
Now she has to console me, right?
If she has a big man in her...
I will be the woman for her
Machi.... I have seduced atleast 100 MILFs
Out of them... 3 have tricked me
This is a 'sappa matter' (nothing)
What 'sappa matter'?
Our 'Sappa' has no matter
Really?
(Sappa) I got everything
EVERYTHING?
Show it to us
hey, fuck off
Where to?
Here!
What is a pussy like you doing here?
Do you want a different job?
OK..
I will make a call, go see him
Whom?
Him!
Sappa.. why are you so 'sappa' (nothing)
Have you done anything in life?
Look at our Ayya!
Even at his age, he keeps up with an young girl
The old man doesn't trust us with her
But he trusts you
Why?
Because you are a 'sappa'
Are you gonna stay this way forever?
Or will you at least do something?
I will do everything
Everything?
Compared to this that was way better?
Which is?
This!
(Pasupathy) Hey Sappa, go buy me a tea
I bought it already
OK, buy one more
You stay here
A mule has come from Rameswaram
- What is it?
Powdered cocaine
Market rate is ₹20,000,000
He is willing to sell for ₹5,000,000
- Why?
- His sister loves me?
It's not his
He is just a mule
He is not happy with his cut
So he want to sell it for ₹5,000,000 and settle in life
- Whose is it?
Gajendran's
- He will fuck our shit out
Let him
Yeah, he will try. We are not gonna be quiet
We can manage
If the stuff is in our hands
.. then we can control the business for some time
We can go back to what we were...
It's a... good deal
Why? Are you a limp dick now?
Grandpa has gone limp
Can I speak my mind?
Lend me ₹5,000,000, I will take care of the business
The risk is all mine.
Now on, I will take over such risky businesses
We will split the profits 50-50
What do you think?
- Can we do the deal tomorrow?
(yes)
- I will call the Marwari
- He will give a 'five'
- Go fetch it
- You first check the stuff
- We will think about our cuts later
- Pasupathy
- I am no limp dick
- Still got it
Mayilvaganam Sir, we are here
Who's doing this business? Ayya or you?
Don't know. That is Ayya's style
(Chittu) You kept running your mouth
We shit our pants, didn't know what to do there
'you didn't know what to do'?
Do as Ayya tells you to!
You do work for him..
Bark if you dress up as a dog
(on phone)Yeah, tell me Kasthuri!
I am coming
I am on a job
Pasupathy, what's with the crowd?
♪ (Ponmeni uruguthey from Moondram Pirai)♪
Isn't it a good song?
I love this girl (Actress Silk Smitha)
Poor girl! Untimely death
(Pasupathy) Sir, where is the stuff?
They told me it has arrived. It's some name.
It's in the tip of my tongue. But it's not coming to me yet.
Do you know why?
Bava lodge
Are you gonna snatch it?
Don't know
Sir, can you keep this quiet?
Don't know
(Chittu) Pasupathy, I thought he was Gajendran's man?
You think he is a thug?
He is a police sub-inspector
If there is money, he will work for anyone
What is he saying about me?
Nothing bad, you carry on boss
Do you realize whose stuff it is?
A good drink is never without a stink.
You know about Gajendran, don't you?
He is a SOB. Better watch your ass.
What's all this fuss about Gajendran?
Is he a big dickwagger?
Yes, he is the biggest
Master, 5 teas!
Let me tell you a story
15 years back..
Gajendran and Gajapathy were peaking in their import/export business
There was this guy, related to them....
Brother-in-law?
A distant brother-in-law
He was working as a mule for them
In a deal...
...instead of 10 pieces only 8 showed up
Gajendran had a big doubt on the mule
He brought mule's whole family...
- ... and kicked the piss out
- His own brother-in-law?
ha, that's mean shit
Right in front his family...
... broke his fucking face
Then he poured boiling oil on him..
...the skin started peeling off
His kids are crying out loud now
His wife is hysterical
After all that, he still sticks to his story
Now comes the plot twist
A call comes in..
...for Gajendran
'Boss, the stuff is all alright'
'It was a packing mistake..'
'The Mule's hands are clean'
...and the call ended.
The beaten up mule is now staring at Gajendran
Gajendran slowly took out a knife out of his pocket..
...and sliced open mule's throat
The blood gushed out like flush water
Mule was dead
Why he did that?
'After all this torture today...'
'...if he gets a chance tomorrow...'
'...and the knife turns around...'
'..that's why!'
Now brother Gajapathy goes to the wife...
'It was a honest mistake..'
'.. was a business misunderstanding'
'So, don't bring it up ever'
He even apologized to her
Now Gajendran walks to the wife ...
...takes her hand like he is consoling her..
..and says 'Don't let anyone know'...
..takes her hand to his mouth..
...and bites the fucking thumb off her hand.
'She agreed not to say a word'
'Then, why did you bite the finger?'
... asks Gajapathy
'After she speaks, it's no use in chopping fingers '
That's Gajendran
The girl never came back in town after
Just with his teeth?
I have heard a story about a vanishing ghost hitchhiker
Ask if they have seen it, they will reply 'no'
But his acquaintance's acquaintance had seen it
This is just a built up legend
...and you fell for it
You only look smart..
..but you are dumb ass
♪ (Santhana Kaatre from Thanikattu Raja) ♪
Bava Lodge
(Mule) That's all Kalaiya. I bring the goods
Deliver and get ₹10,000 for that
After that, for 2 months..
..drinks and cuties
Bring the goods again
Deliver
Drinks and cuties
You can't believe me?
See this
(Kalaiyan) The cutie is not that cute
...but she still makes me jealous of you
You jelly?
If you get caught, you are a jelly
So, I have decided..
I am not giving it this time
Instead
I am giving it to these guys
They have tricked by throwing just 10,000 at me
I didn't know about it's worth
How much you get here?
15,000?
20,000?
That much?
What is in here?
Like X-ray goggles?
Can we see everything through the clothes?
hmm, you will see nothing
All lights are out
You will feel nothing
It's white man's snuff
I am settled for life with this
A drink to that
One for me?
(Kodukkapuli) Haven't moved it's lazy ass
Hey Kalaiya
Why is Kodukkapuli pissed?
Is he yelling at the cock or me?
I have the same question
Hey Kodukkapuli
Feed the cock it will be hungry now
Mind your fucking business
He is a funny talker
A kid is cursing at you, do you have no shame?
What's the shame in it?
He is my own blood
My son Kodukkapuli...
Curse a few swear words at your dad
He won't curse now, that's the technique
He is just like his mom
Fair skinned , wavy hair...
.. and a proud person
I gambled away all my fortunes..
.. that's why the anger
No, I may not look that way
I am from a Zamindar(aristocrat) family
Someone just bought my palace to make it a hotel
Idiots
I lost everything
At last, I opened a small store
I gave away the goods on credit
When I went asking for money..
They replied, 'How can an aristocrat ask money?'
I couldn't insist on returning the money...
....from those poor peasants
But I couldn't leave it at that
Then, I borrowed ₹2,000 to buy more goods...
.. but it was some kind of rocket interest loan
The lender is now asking for ₹5,000 to payoff
Now, threatening too
Where do I go for that much money?
That's why, we brought the cock here
Now, after Kaattu Munieswaran, he is our family deity
This Kaalayan's last treasure
After he wins today, I am going to settle all debts
... and save my family
Come here my golden goose
(Kudukkapulli) Don't touch my rooster.
It's actually his rooster
To me, he is my son.
For him, the rooster is his son
If it were mine, I would have sold and gotten drunk
Kaalaya, whom did you borrow the money from?
From Varaagamoorthy
That asshole?
If he doesn't get back the money...
... he sells their wives and kids for prostitution
So, it is for real?
Does it really happen?
I didn't listen to anyone's advice back home
You came from nowhere and you know what he does
I had no clue
Everything is lost
Drink up, all will be well
You don't think it will happen?
Don't worry
You! who talks like that?
Act like a grown man
OK, stop drinking. Listen to the grown up there
He is angry
I am proud
I have a room
I am leaving
Kodukkapuli, I will see you later
Bye Kaalaya
So wasted
Pa, wake up!
Getting late for the fight
Wake up!
Hey, you shouldn't fight with anyone
Yeah... yeah... Let's go
Lift your hand. The other one
Turn around
Someone's in our room
- Please take him to his room
- OK
- Please go
- OK

Don't feel bad that he hit you. He is a good man
A good man?
I am young enough to be his grand kid
He abducted me to be his mistress
And you call him good?
Earlier he couldn't do it..
....to hide that he beat me
And you call him good?
You were upset...
..was trying to console you
I don't know these things....
That's why I am 'Sappa' and no one likes me
But I really like you
Why?
Because you are like me...
Don't cry
- You need some talent for that

If I walk on the streets...
I can get both the girl and her mom

I will come home at night
Let me tell you something
I have seduced many MILFs
But there is one MILF, I want to do...
... our Subbu
(on phone) wear that red sari
Why are you looking at me like that?
Don't you have that idea?
Will you kick her off the bed?
Well, he is loyal
You don't wish that?
Everyone staring like I am a pervert
That poor girl!
I am thinking with love too
I do really like her
Ayya tricked her that she will be a movie star
I have liked her since then
Pardon me you high Sirs.
(on phone) OK stop talking and cut the phone
Anna(bro), is it Anni(sis-in-law)?
No, sunni(dick)
oh, he is pissed. Let me see
What is this shit-brick?
There are way better phones now
Why do you still have this?
- Why do I need that?
- Why?
In a video phone, you can watch actress showering
What can you see in that tiny screen? Give it back
OK, no video phone
Why not buy a color or speaker phone?
Why do you need a speaker? Are you deaf?
Look at our Chittu
When MILFs speak to him, we listen to it on speaker
'You are the best, my husband is nothing'
It gets me going
Don't they know it's on speaker?
The ones falling for him?
They all have to be dumb
Don't talk bad about them, Pasupathy
It's not about being dumb or sharp. It's technology
Let me put this call on speaker..
If they don't find it out...
... you are buying beer for all of us
Why beer for everyone?
You spoke before them, so you should
Sir, Sir, please get the phone
They wouldn't mind, lets bet on it
Shhh. It's Ayya
- Yeah, what's up?
- (male voice) Are you busy?
No, I am not
(Ayya) Why didn't you answer, nasty cunt?
It was in my pocket so it took a while
Where are the goods?
Have you gone past the police checkpost?
Not yet
OK, kill Pasupathy before the checkpost
Aren't we all friends?

gave the goods...the details...and left
Have we seen this guy before?
Then why did he show up and give us this?

Why pick up the phone, if you won't talk?
It has been a long time
Singapermal! Why did you steal my drugs?
Whose drugs are those?
Reply
It's mine
Whose mule brought it?
He is mine too

Motherfucker!
Are you making me suck my own dick?

Don't you know the value of drugs? I will destroy you
Everyone knows about your brother Gajendran
I wouldn't take your drugs
Pasupathy took it
Doesn't make a fucking difference if he took or you did
He used to be my man, but not anymore
Don't mess with me. I will kill him
Kill him and show me your not a bitch
I will buy you a sucker
Mullu is from that area, right?
- Ask him to kill Pasupathy
- But he still got the drugs
- Then kill him after getting the drugs
- Mullu is pain in the ass
I don't care
Singaperumal, if I find out you both are playing me...
... I will crush your balls. You know me.
I have told you. Don't care if you won't believe
If you want to show up...
You got your sickle, right? We can resolve with it
Gajendran doesn't have the drugs
Pasupathy hasn't reached there yet
Send few our men, let them search for it
It should be at the lodge... bring it to me
By then, Gajendran would have killed Pasupathy
3 birds with one stone
Drugs in our hands... one bird
Gajendran killing Pasupathy... second bird
What's the third bird?
You are the stupid turkey. Go do the job.
Did you see?
Your buddies came and picked her up
- When?
- It has been a while
Son of a whore!
what's with the swearing?

After meeting death face to face..
..I have no confusion
My mind is all clear
If they took Kasthuri, to make me go there....
... she will be alive till I get there.
For now, Kasthuri is safe
Till they get the drugs, they won't kill me
.... till then I am safe as well

What do you think now?
Hey Jokers, he is by the broken clock tower
But you have to accept a fact, Kodukkapuli
Your dad is smarter than my dad
Kodukkapuli
We don't know if these folks are good or bad
What if they beat us and steal the stuff?
Oh yeah. You are smart for real.
You don't know a lot about your dad
Can you give me the bag?
Let me go hide this bag
If they show up, sternly say it to them..
'Show the money, have the honey'
Kodukkapuli, where are you hiding it?
- I won't tell. You are a blabbermouth
- All of him is poison. (lovingly)
Shit! The chasers at the lodge are in the Maruti car
(approaching footsteps)
Dad!
My silver pistol is missing
Did you take it?
(Maruti van door opening)
No
(Van door locking)
I swear, I don't know
Him?
(someone answering a phone call)
Do you know English?
I got a call that Pasupathy escaped from Mullu
If my guess is right...
Pasupathy will join Gajendran to cause trouble
If not, he will pull his loyal men to create a new gang
I have to ruin it somehow
Call Sub-Inspector Mayilvahanan
We have to "leak information" to Gajendran
That bitch won't believe, if it came directly from us
'Enemy's enemy is a friend'
.. it is Ayya's mantra
If my guess is right....
Sir, I have to meet Mullu at your police station?
Can you arrange that?
Hey, he won't show up
Why will Gajendran's man agree to meet Ayya's man?
Tell him it's Pasupathy, he will show up today
- ₹ 2000
- I will pay in the evening
Will you be alive till then?
Hey Gajendran, how much cash do you got at hand?
- What the cunt-hair for?
- I have some good information for you
May I palm read your future ?
I can read the past and the future
I think you don't believe me
Pick 2 flowers, let me palm read only if I get them right
Have you picked them?
There are flowers of different kind, color, smell
There is Lily, Lotus, Chrysanthemum and more
But they are not what you picked
They are not daisy, water lily, chrysanthemum or ghanera
You thought of a white colored flower
And one in pink color
The two flowers you picked are...
Jasmine and Rose
Is it right, Sir?
What are those two flowers you had picked?
Andy Flower and Grant Flower
- What is this shit?
- I told you earlier but no one believed
- He shot at me. But at blank point, he let Mullu live
- I am done with this shit
Gajapathy, this is the station. Can't kill anyone here
We saw them meet secretly. Let us hear what Mullu has to say
- Mullu, why are you late?
- It got late
Where? At the police station?
- What did you talk about?
- We spoke nothing
- How much did he offer?
- We didn't speak shit
- Why not?
- Because he is a dumb cunt
He had a chance to kill you, why didn't he?
I am asking you
I told you. Can't you understand the first time?
Are you that stupid?
He is paying the cop to meet you. Yet he said nothing?
Because he is a dumb cunt
He took your gun.. had it on your head...
Yet he shot at someone far away and not you?
Because he is a dumb cunt
Mullu...
..if I believe it, I am the dumb cunt
Do you think this is wrong?
Subbu, worm is eaten by fish, fish is eaten by man. It's life!
When you put it that way
Can we do it right?
Let me repeat our plan. See if it is good
When we go home, Ayya will be in a afternoon nap
Key will be under his pillow.
We will take the safe key out and get the bag
Lock it and leave the keys in the same spot Subbu!
That's your only responsibility
I will leave the bag at the corner shop
.. and tell him that 'We will get the bag later'
When Ayya wakes up, ask him that you want to see a movie.
Ayya wouldn't let you alone, so he will send me along
We will leave as if we are going to movies ...
- ... grab the bag and escape!
- Escape!
Movie is 3 hours. To and fro is 2 hours.
For 5 hours, Singaperumal won't look for us
By then, we would be in Andra
- That's all
- Simple
Watch out Subbu, you know nothing
You are safe, because I was here
But you are always going to be with me
Did you notice that I called Ayya as 'Singaperumal'?
Fear is still there, but braveness has come
(Kaalaiyan crying in pain)
I really don't know
Where?
My son has hid it somewhere
Where is your son?
Where is your son?
Where is he now?
Wherever you caught me...
..he is somewhere near by
I don't know where he is now
Let him go
This morning, you killed my fighting cock
I didn't take it personally
You didn't care I am an Aristocrat
You beat me up
I didn't take it personally either
But let us stop everything here, OK?
We can stop
But you are not telling me the truth
But I told everything I know
(Kaalaiyan crying out in pain)
I am really scared Subbu
What if we mess it up?
Let's drop all of it
Let us not see each other or talk
You are alive, that's enough for me
Don't want any of these plans
- Why Subbu?
- Listen to me, no!
If Ayya once....
just once...
...suspects a little bit
I don't care what happens to me, but you...
What were we thinking?
Who is he?
He controls the whole city
We are just some idiots
Let's not do this plan, please
Why Subbu?
Because I really like you
Sorry for everything
Please hug me one last time
But I don't like being here
Let us take a risk
Let's escape
- Why?
- Because I like you too
Whore!
Beat me now
I got my son.. he will destroy you
What the fuck is this shit?
We can't do anything for sometime
Is it our stuff?
Look at this village idiot's valor
10,000 lost on nothing
Now, where to search for his son?
Why did you take my dad?
We told we were returning the powder
Wrong number
Hey yellow shirt, the call is for you
- Which powder are you talking about?
- The one in Bava Lodge
- Where is that powder?
- It is with me
- Where are you?
- Let go of my dad, I will tell you
- I don't have your dad
- He spoke to you on phone
- To me? This number?
- Hmm
- Do you have another number?
- Should I call them?
Listen
Don't call them. If you do...
...they will take you too
Give the stuff to me, I will save your dad
How do I trust you?
Whoever took your dad, took my wife too
Give the stuff to me...I will save your dad
You couldn't keep your wife safe...
..how are you going to save my dad? Cunt-hair!
Motherfucker, then call them. They will take you too.
Do you have any other way?
That's why you are calling this number.
I will save him, not for you or your dad
..because I want my wife, that's why
Don't call them
Will you?
I won't
OK.
Come to AK mills at 5
Do you know where it is?
It is near by, ask around
My name is Pasupathy
I am Kodukkapuli
What's with the on-time payments?
What did you speak with Mullu?
It's way more than I want
I need another help, keep it as advance
I am listening
The stuff everyone's looking for... I have it
I am ready to return it to Ayya..
...instead Kasthuri and a man called 'Kaalaiyan'
..ask for their release
I won't cause him trouble, neither should he
Only you can talk and make him compromise
Why don't you speak?
Ask me to beat up 4, I can...
...I can't think and speak
I said something this morning and it has gone this far
I know you can make it happen
Ok, give me your phone
Use your phone, I will pay for it
Why are you talking like that?
At 5:30, Pasupathy will bring the stuff to AK mills
Go take it
What?
I am thinking
What are you thinking? 'Thinking-ka-baal'
As in, what do with Pasupathy?
Kiss and make out with him
Go kill him. Leave!
What do I do with you?
At least this time, do the job right!
And don't bring his mom or gradmom this time
I don't want them
Go, do it!

Rub it
Here
Here
That's enough. Before your massages felt like little girl's
What happened today? Have you come of age?
Alright, I will buy you tampoons
Call me if Marwari comes. Have to return the cash
I earned this money, don't want to lose it in govt. raids
He is awake, how do we do that?
The money will be gone when Marwari comes by.
Before Ayya finishes showering...
...can you drop off the bag at the shop?
Please we won't get another chance
Subbu, pick up the phone
Who?
Got disconnected
Beautiful
Wonderful
Marvelous
- Are we OK?
- Take it out
That's it!
Hurry up
What if Ayya asks about me?
OK. I will make an excuse
Wait a minute
I am scared
- Why do we need that?
- Just in case. Keep it
Keep an eye out. Be careful
Why are you late? Where is the powder?
Where is my dad?
I told you I will get him. Go fetch it. Go!
I told you. Go get it.
Show my dad, only then I will give it.
Is your dad with me?
Listen. Give me powder. I will exchange that for your dad
Then why will I give it to you? I will give it to them
I will kill you.
Why can't you understand?
I am gonna trust you. Don't betray me
- You stay here
- I will come with you
- Where is my dad?
- These guys are different
If you trick a little boy, I will murder you and cut you up
If I don't get my dad, I will murder you. Give the bag, I will take care
I will get your dad, like I told you
Stay here
Gajendran
A lot have gone wrong between us
I will return the goods back to you. Lets not fight
Gajapathy, you get this
I will explain the problem, you will understand
- Gajapathy
- First, I will check the goods. We can cut him after
I wanted to do business, but I messed it up. Sorry!
Do you ever think before acting? Dumb cunt
Gajapathy
There is thin line between Idiot and genius..
.. I am crossing that line now
I pissed off Ayya
But he is a heavy weight
I can do anything against him alone
I need another heavy weight for that
Gajendran is a heavy weight, but..
..he was pissed off too
If Gajendran gets psychotic mad, he will annihilate
But he doesn't get angry like Gajapathy
I will have to mess with him... to make him do what I need
Think. Think. Think.
My first step - Mullu
Why am I here, if you are not talking? Dumb cunt!
That triggered Gajendran. Now he is angry
He is not psychotic yet.
Step 2 - To get Gajendran and Gajapathy with the gang
... to a place of my choosing
..you can make it happen..
Hello Gajendran
If he said 5:30, we should be there early
My last step - Gajapathy
Now... Gajendran is maniac mad
Anger is blinding his eyes
Why try so hard to make Gajendran...
...maniacally mad at me?
For this!
Machaa, they are here
Singaperumal, you son of a whore
Pasupathy and Singaperumal have been playing me
Kill them all!
Why did I believe they will end up fighting?
Enemy's enemy is a friend. True.
But more importantly...
...they both are still enemies
Subbu...
Who called?
(kitchen utensils clanging)
Subbu... Sappa...
Where is the bag?
Where is Sappa?
I don't know
Sappa escaped with the bag full of money
Go. Catch him.
Sappa ran with the money, find him!
Where did you go?
Madam asked to buy fruits
Where is the money?
Where is the bag?
Sappa bitch! Tell me
Where is the bag?
Are you looking for this?
You are trying to kill me?
You were right to be scared Subbu...
Did you mess it up Subbu?
No, I didn't
Make them cry somehow...
..make your move when consoling..
What if we steal from our Ayya?
I am scared Subbu
If we mess it up?
Lets drop all plans
- Lets risk it Subbu
- Why?
Because I like you too
Just in case. Keep it
Machi.... I have seduced atleast 100 MILFs
Out of them... 3 have tricked me
This is a 'sappa matter'
We all would think that he was a common person...
... but Rajini was Baashaa, the don
What a fucking Joker!
Sappa shot Ayya?
So you killed Sappa for that?
You have suffered a lot here..
Leave
I will take care. Leave
Ayya, tell me
This is not Ayya....Pasupathy
Singaperumal tried to kill me
Now, he is not alive
I killed Gajendran
Killed Gajapathy
Nagaraj is out of picture too
Now on, it's just me
I know you did this for Ayya
I am not angry at you
But, Kasthuri needs to be here... now
Take him to the hospital
- Do you like you dad so much?
- Not like that
But he is my dad
Had any problem?
What happened to the money?
Only Sappa knows
That dog is dead now
Thank you so much
- How is Ayya doing?
- He is very good
Someone who will listen to me
Someone to blame for the money
I needed an Idiot for that
He was Sappa
Otherwise, there is nothing about how he is innocent
Just like he said...
'Worm, fish, man...life is like that'
To me, Sappa is just man.
All men are sappa(nothing) too
Watch out Subbu, you know nothing
You are safe, because I was here
Idiot
