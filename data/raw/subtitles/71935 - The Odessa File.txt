Hannah, would you mind?
What I am going to teII you is,
of course, top secret.
The Egyptians have rockets
based at HeIwan.
The targets are Acre, Haifa, TeI Aviv-Jaffa.
That wouId be the first strike.
The second strike wouId straddIe
the whoIe country.
The rockets wiII have speciaI warheads.
They wiII contain bubonic pIague
and strontium 90.
If it succeeds, it wiII be the end of IsraeI.
AII they are waiting for is compIetion
of a teIeguidance system...
...without which
they can´t target the rockets.
I have received this.
Scientists are working
on the teIeguidance system...
...somewhere in Germany,
under the cover of a Iegitimate factory.
They´re bIameIess because they don´t know
they are working for the Odessa.
They have nearIy compIeted the job.
David, we must find that factory, quick.
I´II fIy back tonight.
This is the West German
Broadcasting Network.
We are interrupting our programme
to take you direct to the United States...
...for a further report
on the condition of the President.
This is Washington.
We have just received confirmation
that President Kennedy is dead.
President John F. Kennedy
died at the Parkland Hospital...
...following a shooting
at Dallas earlier today.
Mrs. Kennedy was at her husband´s side...
...while surgeons administered
an emergency blood transfusion.
But it was not possible
to save the President´s life.
We will be--
Events that can change history
sometimes hang on tiny chances.
If I hadn´t pulled to the curb
I wouldn´t have caught the traffic light...
...nor seen the ambulance...
...never have heard of Salomon Tauber
or Eduard Roschmann.
Nor got involved with the agents of Israel...
...or with the sinister and deadly men
behind the Odessa.
That night I was just a reporter
with a nose for a possible story.
Press!
Sorry, you can´t go in there.
-What´s going on?
-Ask at the poIice station.
-HeIIo!
-Put it away. It´s nothing.
What happened?
Suicide. An oId man gassed himseIf.
It´s not worth two Iines.
Did you hear about Kennedy?
Yeah.
Just a second.
AII right.
-What have you got there?
-Some of the oId man´s rubbish.
-Put it on my desk.
-Right.
PeopIe are dying
aII over the worId tonight...
...but aII anyone wiII want to read about
tomorrow is Kennedy.
I´d better be going, Peter.
Keep out of troubIe.
On board the plane taking
John Kennedy´s body to Washington...
...the new President was sworn in.
In a voice shaking with emotion...
...a woman judge from Dallas
gave him the official oath to speak.
Mrs. Kennedy still wore
the bloodstained dress...
...in which she had held
her dying husband in her arms.
That´s so terribIe.
You know what you couId get
for the photograph...
...of the man firing those shots?
With syndication rights,
maybe two miIIion marks.
What a thing to say at this moment.
You´re a very scary person.
What did I say?
You don´t know what you said?
You´re a parasite!
You Iive off other peopIe´s troubIes.
It´s the oId job conversation once again.
Is that what it is?
-Come on, Sigi.
-I´m tired. I´ve been working aII night.
And what is it, your work?
Dancing around haIf-naked
in front of a Iot of oId men!
I earn more in a week
than you do in a month!
Anyway, they´re not oId.
Some of them
are much more attractive than you are.
I am sincereIy happy for you.
I´m not sure anyone wouId pay you
to dance around haIf-naked.
You shouId have taken
that reguIar job at the Komet...
...then maybe I wouIdn´t have to work
at the cIub.
You want to turn me into a cabbage?
You are a cabbage.
I´m a freeIance.
It´s not reguIar work,
but when I make money...
...I can make a Iot of money.
I Iike my work.
I´m conscientious and I´m ambitious.
But I´m a freeIance,
and I´m not giving that up.
You know, Monika and I
are very fond of Sigi.
-I´m very fond of you and Monika.
-Don´t you want chiIdren?
You´re very good with chiIdren, Peter.
Other peopIe´s chiIdren.
Do you have some reason
for asking me to this Iunch? Because...
...if we continue any further
with this marriage taIk...
...it may be the end
of a wonderfuI friendship.
I wanted to give you this.
-What is it?
-Something to read.
It was Iying beside the body
of that oId man who gassed himseIf.
-What´s so speciaI?
-You´II see.
But it´s poIice property.
I reaIIy shouIdn´t give it to you,
so keep it to yourseIf, huh?
I aIways do, KarI.
Thanks.
My name is Salomon Tauber.
I have lived this long only because
there was one more thing I wished to do.
The friends I have known, the sufferers
and victims of the camp, are long dead...
...and only the persecutors
are still around me.
I see their faces on the streets
in the daytime...
...and in the night
I see the face of my wife, Esther.
And I remember how she clung to me
on the train...
...as we pulled into the station at Riga.
We had been three days and three nights
in that cattle truck from Berlin...
...without food or water.
The dead, and there were many of them,
were crowded in among us.
It was there I first saw him.
Captain Eduard Roschmann,
the SS Commandant of the camp.
The ´´butcher.´´
Every day brought another trainload
of prisoners.
Roschmann had many of the women,
children and elderly...
...exterminated on arrival.
They were more valuable dead.
Their clothes, their hair,
their teeth were a cash asset.
But Esther and I survived
through that year.
I had been an architect before the war...
...and knew enough of carpentry
to get skilled work.
We laboured 12 hours a day
in the camp workshops...
...or else at the lumber mills
in the damp frozen woods near the coast.
Several times during the following winter,
I thought Esther would die.
The hunger, the cold,
the constant brutalities...
...seemed to have broken her spirit
and her will to live.
Yet, compared to some, we were fortunate.
Many of the prisoners
were given no food at all...
...until they died of starvation.
Roschmann had a hobby.
He liked to destroy human beings.
First their soul, then their body.
Sometimes Roschmann amused himself...
...by kicking those about to die
as they huddled together naked...
...stripped of dignity and of all hope.
He liked watching the dogs feed on them
while they were still breathing.
We had seen a strange van...
...grey coloured,
waiting near the gates of the camp.
It had false windows painted on it.
There were drawings
of people laughing and picnicking.
To the workers in the fields
outside the camp...
...when the van went by...
...it must have looked like there was
a holiday party...
...eating and drinking inside.
Some prisoner musicians
were made to play...
...to add to the festivities.
But we soon found out
that the van had a very different purpose.
Roschmann had converted it
into a gas chamber.
The exhaust pipe
had been fed back into the van...
...so that everyone inside
was suffocated by the fumes.
The expression in Esther´s eyes
has stayed with me always.
After her death, my soul died inside me.
But my body and mind remained alive.
I was determined to survive...
...and one day tell the world
what Roschmann did to our people here.
Peter?
It´s after 8:00.
-Aren´t you supposed to be at the cIub?
-I tried to caII a taxi, but I couIdn´t get one.
A taxi? What do you need a taxi for?
Don´t I aIways take you?
Between 1941 and the end of the war...
...over 200,000 German Jews
were brought to Riga.
400 came out alive.
In late 1944, we began to hear
the crump of mortar fire.
There were rumours that the Russians
had taken the suburbs of Riga...
...and that the German army
would be forced to retreat.
On October 1 1,
50 of us survivors were taken to the docks.
We were helping wounded soldiers
to go on deck...
...when Roschmann drove up
in a staff car...
...and gave instructions
that they should be brought ashore again.
He intended to commandeer the ship
for the SS.
The Captain was dead
before he hit the ground.
The medal that fell from him
into the snow...
...was the Knights Cross
with the oak leaf cluster.
Early in 1945,
a few weeks before the liberation...
...Captain Roschmann of the SS
made up his mind to disappear.
He slipped quietly away in a car
with two other officers.
He was wearing the uniform
of an army corporal.
I saw him go and I was determined
one day to bring him to justice.
But now I know I never will.
I bear no hatred nor bitterness
towards the German people.
Peoples are not evil.
Only individuals are evil.
If, after my death,
this diary should be found and read...
...will some kind friend
please say Kaddish for me?
StiII awake?
Yeah.
Are you aII right?
No.
I have a job to do.
You don´t even know
if this Roschmann´s stiII aIive.
But if he were, say,
hiding out somepIace and I found him...
...that wouId be worth your investment?
Dead Jews don´t seII papers.
These peopIe Roschmann kiIIed...
...they weren´t Russians or PoIes,
they were Germans.
German Jews.
-But stiII Germans.
-Tragic.
It´s a sick worId, isn´t it?
These are the best we can get
on Lady Bird Johnson.
And you think that´s why
I shouId give you a commission...
...because the victims of Riga
were German Jews?
Yes.
PeopIe don´t want to know, Peter.
It´s a dead duck.
-Not to me it isn´t.
-Take my advice. Drop it.
But, Peter, why?
Why do you want to do this suddenIy?
It´s over.
Nobody wants
these dreadfuI triaIs anymore.
It upsets peopIe.
PeopIe shouIdn´t be upset by the truth.
What is the truth?
What do you young peopIe reaIIy know?
You were too young to understand
what it was Iike.
I´II go and make the coffee.
Mother...
...what was it Iike for you?
For me?
We Iived in PerfaIIstrasse then.
You were about that size.
There were bombings every night.
One night, we Ieft the ceIIar
and the whoIe street was gone.
There were firebombs everywhere.
AII I tried....
AII I tried to do was hide your eyes...
...so you couIdn´t see
peopIe burning Iike torches.
When your father came back on Ieave...
...it took him three days to find us,
because we´d moved.
We´d moved in with a famiIy
on the other side of town...
...in AItona. You probabIy remember that.
What was my father Iike?
Was he something Iike me?
He was aIways...
...very sure of himseIf.
Maybe he was a IittIe more secure.
WeII then, I´II teII you something.
Father wouId have been
the first person to say, ´´Go ahead.´´
I don´t Iike the press.
It won´t be any troubIe.
It´s just a sort of story...
...human interest, you know?
You can´t go up. I´ve re-Iet the room.
Did he have any possessions?
Possessions?
-They´re out the back.
-Can I see them?
PossibIe.
Is this his wife?
I don´t know.
Did he have any friends?
-Never saw anybody except oId Marx.
-Marx?
They used to pick up
their oId-age pension together.
Can you make a description of him?
Old. Thin. Long white hair.
Always wears a grey scarf.
Herr Marx?
May I sit down?
I´d Iike to taIk to you about your friend,
SaIomon Tauber.
-He´s dead.
-Yes, I know.
Are you an officiaI?
No.
Not from the authorities?
-The poIice?
-I´m a journaIist. Peter MiIIer.
Before your friend took his Iife...
...he set down his experiences
at Riga Concentration Camp.
A diary.
You were at Riga, too?
Auschwitz.
In the diary, your friend
wrote about an SS officer...
...named Roschmann.
Captain Eduard Roschmann.
I want to find out anything I can about him.
Maybe even he´s stiII aIive.
Something.
Roschmann is stiII aIive.
-How do you know?
-SaIomon saw him.
Yes, I read that. That was in 1945.
That was three weeks ago.
Here in Hamburg.
Are you sure?
He saw him coming out of the opera
with some friends.
Why didn´t he go to the poIice?
He did. He reported it.
But the poIice said he had no evidence.
That´s why he kiIIed himseIf.
You see, he´d come up against the Odessa.
The Odessa?
He shouId have been Iike me.
AII I care about is getting a boat to IsraeI,
that´s aII I want.
Odessa? I don´t know
what you are taIking about.
Come on, KarI.
It´s a secret organization of some sort.
How much have you heard about it?
Just stories, whispers, rumours.
Leave it aIone, Peter, pIease.
Where is the diary?
-I´ve got it safe.
-I want it back.
What´s the matter?
You´re sorry you gave it to me?
I gave you it because I thought
it might make a human interest story...
...not an investigation.
You gave me the diary because you were
moved, and you thought I´d be moved by it.
-I am.
-It´s poIice property.
You don´t want me to foIIow it up
or to go after Eduard Roschmann?
Monika, we are busy.
The chiIdren just want to say good night
to UncIe Peter.
-Say good night, then. But quickIy.
-Good night, Erik!
Good night, UncIe Peter!
-Good night, UncIe Peter.
-Good night, IittIe GreteI.
Now, straight to bed.
I´II be up to put the Iight out.
Why are you so scared?
I´m teIIing you, don´t get invoIved.
It´s not your affair.
War criminaIs are a poIice matter,
but the poIice won´t do anything about it...
...so I´m going to.
-State Attorney GeneraI´s office.
-Which department?
-War Crimes.
-Second fIoor. Room 223.
Thank you very much.
Riga, and the name was?
Roschmann, Eduard.
What´s going on here?
-This gentIeman wanted--
-I heard him.
Who sent you here?
I´m a journaIist.
Come into my office.
Can I see your card?
Why are you so interested
in Captain Roschmann?
Is there some investigation of him?
-Why do you want to know?
-It´s a matter of pubIic interest.
We investigate many things...
...but we cannot give information
concerning the progress of our inquiries.
I´m simpIy asking if there is an inquiry.
The matter is confidentiaI.
I can´t discuss it.
Yes? Put him through.
Herr General. What a nice surprise.
And it´s good to hear you, sir.
Of course I´m coming.
I´ve got the invitation right in front of me.
The one evening in the year
I wouIdn´t miss.
I´II pick you up, sir. How about that?
7:00 p.m., so we can go together.
Fine.
I think I ought to warn you, MiIIer.
It´s a serious offence to interfere
with the machinery of justice.
In 13 years your office has managed
to bring to triaI three SS men...
...aII of them privates. In 13 years!
-Now, Iisten--
-Justice.
ANNUAL MEETING - DIVISION SIEGFRIED
It´s been a good evening, men,
and good to see you.
They can´t kill us off, can they?
Never, Herr Oberst!
And there is Major Krantz.
Not a year older, by the look of it.
There´s a lot of us left.
I welcome you all
to our 18th annual reunion.
Now a few words from someone
who has not been with us...
...for several years.
Your attention, please,
for General Greifer, our general.
Comrades...
...tonight we´re together here.
But when are we apart?
For us, nothing changes.
Germany believes
she doesn´t need us now...
...but one day she´ll know that she does!
We´ll be as mighty again as we ever were!
It´ll take time...
...but the ideals will be the same.
When the drums beat and the bands play...
...and our flags wave again...
...and our whole nation
will be united once more...
...then we´ll march together
to the ends of the earth!
One people. One Germany. One leader!
It´s good to be back,
even if onIy for a few hours.
Greifer went too far tonight.
Very uncIever.
He´II get himseIf into difficuIties again.
Warn him.
Yes, Herr General.
-Take off your coat, Werner.
-Thank you.
-Whiskey?
-A smaII one, pIease.
-Ferdinand?
-Nothing, thank you.
-Nothing. Ice?
-No, thank you.
What was that incident at the raIIy?
A young journaIist.
We know aII about him.
What did he want?
He´s been asking questions about Eduard...
...but he´s not getting anywhere.
-It´s being deaIt with.
-I hope so.
The onIy reason for my visit
is to protect this project.
-Sit down, gentIemen.
-Thank you.
The deadIine for Nasser´s rockets
has been brought forward...
...to March 1.
It is essentiaI...
...that the teIeguidance system is finished
at Ieast six weeks before that date.
Rest assured, Herr General. It wiII be.
I had hoped Kennedy´s death
wouId give us more time...
...but it Iooks as though
President Johnson...
...wiII force the German arms deaI
with the Jews.
So we have three months
to keep our promise to Egypt...
...if the rockets of HeIwan are to fIy...
...against IsraeI.
You shouId have seen them.
The same oId mentaIity.
I thought it was over, but it stiII goes on.
-Have you toId the poIice?
-ToId them what?
About getting attacked.
Having your camera smashed.
They´d just say
I shouIdn´t have been at the raIIy.
They´d be right.
I´m sorry for the oId man,
but since you started this story...
...you´ve had nothing but troubIe.
Who cares?
I care!
I´m feeIing a responsibiIity.
ResponsibiIity for what?
Something new for me, huh?
Let´s forget it now.
Tomorrow I´II get up earIy.
We´II go Christmas shopping together.
Erik, Monika, and KarI.
-Anybody eIse?
-There´s stiII your mother.
-Yeah. Mother.
-I think we shouId´ve bought the earrings.
She´d never wear them.
She never wears anything that I buy her!
I shouId get her something
I couId use myseIf.
Okay, so we buy the earrings.
They´d suit you.
I´II get her another nightgown.
I´m aII right. I´m aII right.
Maybe it was an accident.
It wasn´t an accident.
You know that as weII as I do.
He pushed you!
I don´t care. I´ve had enough.
You´ve had enough?
I was pushed under a train,
and you´ve had enough?
Peter, pIease, don´t go any further.
I´m scared.
I can´t stop now!
AII right.
If you´re going somewhere tomorrow
then I´m coming with you.
You´re not going anywhere!
Peter, why are you doing this?
PIease, don´t ask me that.
I must do this and I must do it aIone.
I don´t know if I´II be here
when you get back.
PIease, be here.
A Iot of peopIe
want Simon WiesenthaI´s address...
-...but we don´t give it to anybody.
-I must see him. It´s urgent.
It aIways is. I´m sorry.
But, you see, apart from Eichmann...
...WiesenthaI has brought
a thousand war criminaIs to justice.
That´s a thousand reasons
why we have to take precautions.
Look, you see those?
They´re aII addressed to WiesenthaI.
But they won´t be deIivered
untiI they´ve been checked.
Checked for what? Bombs?
We Ieave that to the poIice.
They know what to Iook for.
Perhaps you want to see my credentiaIs.
CredentiaIs?
PRESS
Herr BichIer,
this gentIeman wants to Ieave.
WiII you escort him
from the buiIding, pIease?
Be carefuI, before the poIice
start taking an interest in you.
Of course nobody wiII teII you!
What did you expect?
What do you want from Simon WiesenthaI?
I have to see him urgently.
Have you got his address?
I can get it.
But, Peter, this is the Iast time
I am going to heIp you.
Ring me back at 3:00,
and remember, it´s confidentiaI.
What was aII that about?
My journaIist friend caIIing from Vienna.
Yes? Put him through.
I´II finish it Iater.
Yes, I´m Iistening.
No, you were quite right to phone me.
Stay cIose to Braun
untiI I can make arrangements.
Give me Dr. SchuItz´s number in Vienna.
The code is 432, Herr Deilman.
The number is 5-1-7-2-6-5.
O-D-E-S-S-A.
The organization
of former members of the SS.
It was formed at the end of the war...
...to heIp SS men to disappear.
To get them out of Germany.
Set them up with new identities.
Thousands were given forged documents.
This war´s been over for 20 years.
But the Odessa´s grown,
Iike a spider´s web.
It stretches to many countries:
Argentina, Egypt, Spain, Paraguay.
And the centre is in Germany...
...today.
After the war...
...they set out to infiItrate
every facet of Iife.
Commerce, the judges, the Iawyers...
...IocaI government, even the poIice.
That takes a Iot of money.
Money?
They have miIIions!
The SS smuggIed out
most of their goId and art treasures...
...just before Germany coIIapsed.
A Iarge part Iies in vauIts...
...under the pavements
of Zurich, SwitzerIand.
Yes, they have got pIenty.
Recognise these?
The members
of the Hamburg PoIice Department.
Now spread the paper out.
SS, SS, SS, SS...
...and those two, Odessa.
Interesting, huh?
There are thousands
of these peopIe at Iarge.
So what is so speciaI about Roschmann?
Herr WiesenthaI...
...you read the diary.
Roschmann, Eduard. BIue fiIe.
CriminaI at Iarge.
Roschmann was captured by the British...
...on December 20, 1947, in Graz.
He was put under escort
on a train for Munich.
He escaped from his guards
when he went to the Iavatory.
They broke the door down,
but the window was open...
...and Roschmann gone.
They found his tracks in the snow.
He had evidentIy injured himseIf.
But he got away
and made contact with the Odessa.
They wouId give him one of these.
-Passport?
-Not an ordinary passport.
A forged passport
for someone in the Odessa.
And with it, a new identity.
A new birth certificate,
a new job, a new Iife.
By the way, this one was caught.
Find the man
who deaIs with these things...
...and you wiII be cIoser
to finding Roschmann.
I don´t even know
what Roschmann Iooks Iike.
Roschmann.
-When was this taken?
-Nine years ago. In South America.
The man who took the photograph
said he had a Iimp.
ProbabIy the resuIt of his faII
from the train.
May I borrow this?
I wiII make a photocopy.
312, pIease. And I´II be Ieaving today.
Herr MiIIer? Herr Peter MiIIer?
-Yes.
-I wonder if we couId taIk somewhere?
-Your room, perhaps?
-We can taIk here.
Of course.
My name is Schmidt. Dr. Schmidt.
-What do you want?
-Perhaps we can sit down.
A very pIeasant hoteI, this.
-A IittIe too soIid for me.
-What is it that you want?
You´re a journaIist, I am toId.
With a reputation for being very thorough,
very tenacious.
Some friends of mine heard
you are making an inquiry...
...into events that happened
a Iong time ago.
-You mean Eduard Roschmann, don´t you?
-I do.
-I most certainIy do.
-So?
Eduard Roschmann is dead!
-I didn´t know that.
-Of course not.
There´s no reason why you shouId.
I thought I´d mention the fact because
I didn´t want you wasting your time.
TeII me something, Dr. Schmidt,
when exactIy did he die?
In May, 1945,
fighting the American advance.
I´m sorry. You´II have to try harder.
Roschmann was captured
by the British in December, 1947.
Didn´t your friends brief you properIy
when they gave you this errand?
Drop this inquiry!
Roschmann was seen aIive
in Hamburg this year.
It was never confirmed.
You just confirmed it.
Good day, Herr Dr. Schmidt.
-Stay where you are!
-Car keys.
For the Iast time:
What do you know about the Odessa?
OnIy just what Simon WiesenthaI toId me.
So, why after you spoke with WiesenthaI...
...did you contact Ferdinand SchuItz?
Dr. Schmidt. He represented himseIf to me
as Dr. Schmidt...
...and I didn´t contact him.
He contacted me!
David, give us 15 minutes
and we´II get the truth.
I´m teIIing you the truth.
I´ve toId you the truth.
You say he threatened you.
Yes.
Why?
I don´t know why.
Because of your interest in this diary.
Yes, yes!
Peter MiIIer was Iast seen in Vienna
two days ago.
One of our Kameraden taIked to him
at his hoteI.
Then we Iost him compIeteIy.
Who was in charge?
I am in charge!
Here´s the information.
The address of his girIfriend,
MiIIer´s fIat in Hamburg.
There´s aIso a Iist of the peopIe
who are at your disposaI.
Let me know where you are, every move.
We wouIdn´t have caIIed you
if it were not of maximum importance.
And when I catch up with him?
KiII him!
What are you running for?
-Why are you scared?
-Leave me aIone. That hurts.
Just teII me where your boyfriend is.
-I don´t know.
-Don´t give me that.
Where is he? Where is MiIIer?
-In Vienna.
-He´s not.
He Ieft there five days ago.
-Where´s he gone now?
-If I knew I wouIdn´t teII you!
I don´t want you to misunderstand me.
Now, where is MiIIer?
Stop! Let me in, quick.
What happened?
A man attacked me.
Where do you Iive? I´II take you home.
Thank you.
I have toId you
we are members of IsraeIi inteIIigence.
I must aIso teII you we have tried twice...
...to infiItrate the Odessa.
The question is:
How far wouId you go to find this man?
WouId you risk your Iife?
I aIready have.
Your best chance of finding him...
...wouId be to get into the Odessa yourseIf,
of course.
You wouId have some advantages
over the other two.
What are they?
In the first pIace, you are not a Jew, and--
What happened to the other two?
The first we found drowned in the EIbe.
The second disappeared without a trace.
But we´ve Iearned a Iot from our mistakes.
Our contacts are better
than they used to be.
One of them is an expert
on aII SS procedure.
He wouId brief you very thoroughIy.
Can you trust him?
As much as we can trust you.
-What wouId you be gaining from aII this?
-Information about the Odessa.
AII the information
you couId suppIy us with.
AII right, I´II do it.
You made the right decision.
Let´s get started. There´s a lot to do.
We´ll begin with Hartstein
at the Bremen General Hospital.
RECORDS OFFICE
I want the medicaI fiIe
on a RoIf Gunther KoIb.
KoIb?
Arcadia CIinic - DeImenhorst
When wiII Inspector Braun be back?
Maybe next week. He´s away on a case.
Is there someone who couId move in
with you for a few days?
There´s Peter´s mother,
but she Iives in Ahrensburg.
Anyway, I don´t want to upset her.
You reaIIy shouIdn´t be aIone, you know?
I couId arrange for someone to come
and stay with you.
-I don´t think I´d Iike a stranger--
-A girI. A poIicewoman.
You´d feeI safe with her.
-Do you reaIIy think it´s necessary?
-If I didn´t, I wouIdn´t suggest it.
I´II get her to you as quickIy as possibIe.
Don´t go out more than you have to.
Stay away from the nightcIub
and keep in cIose touch with us.
And if you hear from your boyfriend,
Iet us know.
-Name?
-RoIf Gunther KoIb.
-SS number?
-6-2-1-8-0-2.
-Rank?
-Unterscharfuhrer.
-Unit?
-22nd SS SpeciaI BattaIion...
...attached to
FIossenburg Concentration Camp.
TeII me, Unterscharfuhrer KoIb,
what is an Aryan?
An Aryan is invincibIe!
Nature´s chosen ruIer!
What is the Iife expectancy
of a concentration camp inmate?
From one day to nine months.
-What was your date of enIistment?
-January, 1944.
Who was your commandant
at FIossenburg Concentration Camp?
Major Max KoegeI.
-What is the SS motto?
-´´My honour is IoyaIty.´´
-Camp motto?
-´´There is a road to freedom.
´´Its miIestones are obedience,
hard work, honesty, orderIiness...
´´...cIeanIiness, abstinence,
truthfuIness, readiness...
-´´...to sacrifice, Iove for the FatherIand.´´
-Good, Unterscharfuhrer KoIb.
How can we show a profit margin
on a prisoner´s death?
By commerciaI utiIization of the corpse.
GoId fiIIings, cIothing, hair.
But every corpse
means the Ioss of two marks...
...due to the cost of cremation.
If make-up wiII be detected,
we can´t have make-up.
-But we´ve got to age him ten years.
-Peter, pIease come into the Iight.
You see, he has that young face,
young skin.
WeII, no make-up,
but I can do something around the eyes.
-I´m sorry, but as I toId you--
-The moustache is good.
KoIb was tattooed
with an SS bIood group...
...and he wouId have had it removed
if he was on the run...
...so you must have the scar.
-I understand.
-Oster, we´II do it now.
Take off your jacket.
Put up your arm.
CIose your fist
and grip as tightIy as you can.
The first thing they Iook for is the scar.
ExactIy as I did it.
Why do I have to Iearn this so preciseIy?
KoIb hasn´t been in the SS
for over 20 years!
He´s a baker now, not a soIdier.
Pick up that gun.
He´s a 40-year-oId man
recovering from a tumour.
This is crazy!
I´m finished with this. I´m tired.
What I am trying to teach you
may save your Iife.
Pick up that gun.
I need two more weeks.
-He´s not ready.
-We don´t have any more time.
-He´s ready.
-But, David--
-May I come in?
-Here´s our new man.
-How does it feeI?
-Frightening.
-This is it.
-Prosit!
So now, here´s some money.
Driving Iicence
and the watch you asked for.
This is a Ietter written
by your empIoyer Eberhardt...
...at the bakery, on his own stationery.
He´s away on hoIiday for three weeks
and they can´t contact him.
So, that´s what you´ve got.
Three weeks.
You know your contact in Munich,
but Ackermann is shrewd.
Remember the Iron Cross
and don´t forget to pick up the dagger.
-May I heIp you?
-I see you seII war decorations.
I´m interested in an Iron Cross,
Second CIass. An originaI.
For a souvenir?
For my coIIection.
Second CIass.
There´s no swastika in the centre.
They are the onIy ones
we are aIIowed to seII.
Except to friends, Herr Ackermann.
I was asked to give you this.
One moment, pIease.
American tourists buy them
for paper knives.
I think perhaps I can heIp you.
WouId you come in?
Yes?
My name is KoIb.
PIease, come in.
Describe your uniform, KoIb.
Grey-green tunic and breeches.
-Jack boots, bIack Ieather beIt.
-22nd BattaIion?
Yes, sir. Attached
to FIossenburg Concentration Camp.
Remain at attention, KoIb.
This Ietter says you have been in hospitaI.
I had a stomach tumour, sir.
Go on.
I was having tests
and this ward orderIy kept staring at me.
I knew his face.
I remembered he had been a prisoner
at FIossenburg.
WeII?
He was one of the Jews
we´d instructed to burn the bodies of...
...AdmiraI Canaris and the others...
...we´d shot for their attempted
assassination of the Fuhrer.
You were one of those
who executed Canaris?
I commanded the firing squad, sir.
Then the orderIy saw this,
my SS bIood group Ietter.
I´ve since had it burnt off.
Let me see.
I didn´t take any precaution about it
because I didn´t think...
...anyone wouId be interested
in a sergeant.
Now they´re taIking about Canaris
and the others...
...as though they were heroes.
-They were traitors, aII of them, swine.
-That´s enough!
At which hospitaI were you?
Bremen GeneraI, sir.
Ward?
Princess Louise.
This orderIy, what was his name?
Hartstein.
I was at FIossenburg severaI times.
I knew it quite weII.
I don´t remember you, sir.
No.
You seem nervous.
Are you nervous?
I´ve been worried these past weeks.
AII right. Then what happened?
I was transferred to a convaIescent home.
Which one?
Arcadia CIinic at DeImenhorst.
Then I received an anonymous phone caII...
...very officiaI sounding...
...warning that this Jew had informed
the Attorney GeneraI´s office who I was.
-I had to disappear.
-Your empIoyer Eberhardt?
He came to visit me at the nursing home.
When I toId him what had happened
he offered to heIp.
-He gave me that Ietter.
-Why didn´t he contact us himseIf?
Maybe he didn´t want to use the phone
in a matter Iike this.
He was going away on his annuaI hoIiday.
Yes, we checked.
A cruise to the West Indies
is very pIeasant this time of year.
Yes, sir.
I want these teIephone numbers.
Put your jacket on.
Bad Iuck, wasn´t it?
I´m sorry, sir?
16,000 inmates at FIossenburg.
OnIy 700 survived.
You have to be spotted by one of them.
Yes, sir. It was bad Iuck.
Unterscharfuhrer KoIb,
turn round and face me!
Did you receive your dagger?
Yes, sir. From Major Max KoegeI.
There is an inscription on the bIade.
´´BIood and honour,´´ sir.
TeII me, what were the amenities Iike
at FIossenburg?
-Amenities, sir?
-Accommodation.
Two barracks, a gymnasium,
a garrison shop, a whorehouse--
Which everyone shared?
No, sir. Officers had their own.
When you Iooked up from anywhere
in the camp, what did you see?
The sky.
Don´t be stupid!
When we Iooked up?
You mean the ruined castIe
on top of the hiII, where we kept the dogs?
Come and sit down.
Bremen GeneraI?
Princess Louise ward, pIease.
This is the Department of SociaI Security,
Pensions Section.
I want to confirm
that you have a ward orderIy...
...on your staff by the name of Hartstein.
Yes, we have a Jacob Hartstein.
Thank you.
WouId you pIease transfer me
to the Registrar´s office?
Yes, RoIf Gunther KoIb.
His tumour responded to treatment.
He was transferred
to a convaIescent cIinic.
Could you tell me which one?
Of course. Arcadia CIinic in DeImenhorst.
Thank you.
Arcadia CIinic.
KoIb?
Oh, yes, one moment, pIease.
-Is there any troubIe, sir?
-We´II soon find out.
HeIIo, this is Dr. ReitIinger here.
Can I heIp you?
I am inquiring about a patient
caIIed Gunther KoIb.
Is he stiII with you?
He discharged himseIf Iast week.
He was very much better.
It was a pIeasure. Goodbye.
Your tumour seems to have improved.
I don´t have much pain now, sir.
You´II need a new identity.
And a new passport.
I´m sending you to one of our peopIe
in Bayreuth.
His name is KIaus Wenzer.
He´s a speciaIist at this kind of thing.
ProbabIy the best.
After he´s fixed you up with documents...
...he´II pass you on to someone
who´II teII you what to do next.
Take Herr KoIb to the station
and see he gets the train to Bayreuth.
-We´II buy your ticket for you.
-You´ve been very kind, sir.
Don´t worry, KoIb.
One day we´II ask you to heIp us.
-We must heIp each other, mustn´t we?
-Yes, sir.
The Bayreuth train Ieaves in haIf an hour
from pIatform three.
-I´II wait with you.
-PIease, don´t bother. I can manage.
Thank you.
Yes?
Sigi?
-Is that Peter?
-Who is this?
One moment, I´II get her.
Sigi, it´s Peter on the phone.
-Why didn´t you caII me?
-That´s what I am doing.
-Peter?
-Sigi?
-Peter!
-Sigi, is that you?
Of course it´s me.
Where are you? It´s a terribIe connection.
I´m fine. It´s wonderfuI to hear your voice.
Who was that girI?
Listen, I was attacked in the EIbe tunneI
and I went to the poIice.
I can´t hear you.
-Are you aII right?
-No, I´m not aII right.
I´m angry and frightened
and I want you to come home.
-Where are you?
-I´m at Munich Station.
I´ve a few more things to do,
but it won´t take Iong.
What are you doing at Munich Station?
-I want you to come home.
-Sigi, who was that girI?
I can´t hear you.
-Peter!
-I have to go now.
Sigi, I Iove you.
Are you certain this girI got it right?
From Munich Station an hour ago?
That´s very heIpfuI. Thank you.
Yes?
This is Werner.
We have a probIem and I need your heIp.
We are looking for someone called Miller,
Peter Miller.
He was at Munich Station
about an hour ago...
...making a telephone call to Hamburg.
Just a moment.
Fredrich?
Yes, sir?
You said Herr KoIb made a teIephone caII
from the station?
Yes, Herr Bayer,
just before he got on the train.
-Excuse me, Herr Wenzer?
-Yes?
RoIf Gunther KoIb.
Yes, I´ve been expecting you, Herr KoIb.
They just teIephoned me
to teII me you were coming.
But I didn´t expect you to be here
quite so soon.
-You don´t Iike to read the Ietter?
-Of course. The Ietter.
Come into the office.
-How Iong have you been here?
-I came directIy from the station.
Good. Do you have a driving Iicence?
I´m sorry, I shouId offer you a cigarette,
but I don´t smoke.
I think smoking is very bad for the heaIth...
-...so I don´t smoke and I don´t drink.
-I don´t smoke either.
No, no, of course not.
I shaII have to keep this.
Excuse me, pIease.
PIease, make yourseIf at home.
It´s my mother. She´s very iII.
She shouId be in the hospitaI,
but you know what they´re Iike.
-They can´t give the attention Iike I can.
-No, of course not.
We´ve aIways been very cIose,
Mother and I.
How Iong wiII it take for the documents?
It depends. First of aII I need photographs.
-The man I use is away for the weekend.
-It is urgent.
Yes, naturaIIy.
But there are aIso various
technicaI preparations.
No, you must stay at the hoteI
untiI Monday.
The ExceIsior, it´s not very far from here.
It´s nothing much, but it is comfortabIe
and you wiII be safe there.
-You must be patient.
-You do aII your printing here?
-Here, yes, aII here.
-When shaII I see you again?
On Monday morning at 10:00.
Perhaps we couId meet over the weekend.
-Discuss oId times.
-I´m sorry.
It´s very difficuIt with Mother.
I´m sure you understand.
It´s just 300 metres down the road
to your Ieft.
UntiI Monday, 10:00.
-Has he gone?
-Yes, Mother. He´s gone.
One of these days, they wiII do to you...
...what they did to your father.
It wasn´t them, Mother.
They kiIIed him
when he was no Ionger any use to them.
They kiIIed him.
-Father died in a car accident.
-And they wiII do it to you.
You know too much. Just Iike him.
Do you stiII do what I toId you?
Yes, Mother. AIways.
And I wouIdn´t hesitate to make use of it
if there was any troubIe.
So do stop worrying.
-HeIIo?
-KoIb?
This is Wenzer.
I´ve managed to get hoId
of the photographer.
He can be here in an hour
and take your picture tonight.
Tonight?
After aII, you said it was urgent
and I´ve gone to a Iot of troubIe.
It´s after 12:00.
We are Iucky,
he is not Ieaving untiI tomorrow morning.
He´s on his way here now.
I reaIIy think you shouId come.
AII right, I´II be there.
Good. Then I´II see you in an hour.
What happens now?
I don´t want you here when he comes.
-But I can´t Ieave Mother.
-I´II Iook after Mother.
I´m very good with the sick.
-Come back in the morning.
-Why can´t I stay in the house?
There might be a IittIe bIood.
What if something shouId happen to her
whiIe I´m away?
Don´t argue, Wenzer.
AII right.
I´II just go up and see her
to teII her not to worry.
You´ve got 15 minutes.
Excuse me?
I´d Iike to make a phone caII.
May I have the phone book, pIease?
-LocaI or nationaI?
-LocaI.
Turn out the Iight.
Leave the door open.
Thank you.
´´HaiI Mary, the Lord is with you.
BIessed art thou among women...
´´...and bIessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
´´HoIy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...
´´...now and at the hour of our death....´´
Who is that?
Father, a Mass must be said for my boy.
They kiIIed Viktor
and now they´re going to kiII my KIaus.
I know it, Father.
Who is going to kiII KIaus?
The Odessa.
-Where is KIaus?
-Hiding. Hiding from them.
-Where?
-He wouIdn´t Ieave me. He wiII come back.
If they threaten him, he wiII use the fiIe.
What fiIe?
In the safe. I toId him, for protection.
-KIaus wiII need the fiIe.
-Yes, yes.
-They won´t harm him then.
-I can take the fiIe with me.
KIaus needs protection.
What´s the number to the safe?
TeII me. I´II get the fiIe.
-The teIephone....
-No, not the teIephone.
The safe.
Last four numbers teIephone....
NEW IDENTITY: HANS JOSEF KIEFEL
-HeIIo?
-Sigi, Iisten, don´t ask any questions.
I want you to do something for me.
Something very important.
But you mustn´t teII anybody,
do you understand?
Not Mother, not anyone.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I shaII Iook forward to it.
We´II have a IoveIy day together.
You shouId have Iet me answer.
Who was it?
OnIy Peter´s mother.
She´s coming up to see us next Thursday.
Sigi, what do you think you´re doing?
Open this door!
This is one of fifty.
-And I have them aII.
-How did you get them?
Wenzer didn´t trust his comrades.
He kept the fiIe for protection,
to use if they ever turned against him.
Yes, and where´s the rest of the fiIe?
I have it safe somewhere.
If I gave it to you now,
you wouIdn´t need me anymore...
...and you might go after Roschmann
by yourseIves.
It was our agreement that I wouId deaI
with Roschmann on my own.
Yes, and if you faiI?
That´s taken care of.
If anything happens to me,
you´II get the fiIe.
But if you are not going to give it to us
now, why have you come here?
I want my car, my own cIothes,
1,000 marks for expenses.
And I want Tauber´s diary back.
Who´s there?
It´s me, Sigi.
Is there anyone with you?
OnIy the porter. Open the door.
Thank you.
Perhaps you had better unpack your things.
Yes, I´II do that.
WeII, now you know everything.
Everything, I promise.
Why couIdn´t you have toId me
in the first pIace?
Why couIdn´t you have trusted me?
I wish I had.
What time is it?
It´s Iate. I have to go now.
So soon?
The officiaI opening
of the KiefeI EIectric Trade Fair...
...is at 10:00.
-Peter, I´m scared.
-Don´t worry.
Just Iisten carefuIIy.
If I´m not back by tomorrow morning...
...if for some reason I´m deIayed...
...I want you to take a train to Munich.
Here´s a key to one of the Iockers
at the station.
There´s a number on it.
In the Iocker you´II find the fiIe.
I want you to go straight to Vienna
and give it to Simon WiesenthaI.
Here´s a Ietter for him.
The address is on the enveIope.
AIso there´s some money.
Don´t Iook so anxious.
It´s just a precaution.
On behalf of Kiefel Electric,
Hans Josef Kiefel welcomes you...
...our special guests and members
of the press, to a demonstration...
...of our advanced electronic equipment.
First we are proud to welcome
our distinguished guests of honour...
...who will declare this trade fair open.
Raimond, if Herr DeiIman arrives,
send him up immediateIy.
Very weII.
Put the phone down!
Step away from the desk!
Further.
AII right. There.
Yes, the poIice are outside,
but don´t try to caII them.
I have no intention of caIIing them.
What do you want?
My name is Peter MiIIer,
and yours is Eduard Roschmann.
CIose the curtains.
Now the others.
You got that Iimp escaping from the British
in 1947, didn´t you, Roschmann?
When you jumped from the train.
I don´t reaIIy know
what you´re taIking about.
I am Hans Josef KiefeI,
and who was the man--
Riga, I´m taIking about Riga...
...where you were responsibIe
for the murder...
...of 80,000 men, women and chiIdren,
Herr Commandant!
Do you mind if I smoke?
PIease, don´t make the mistake
of not taking me seriousIy, Roschmann.
I do take you seriousIy.
There were never
80,000 disposed of at Riga.
Not even 70,000.
70,000, 60,000. Does it reaIIy matter
how many you kiIIed?
Move away from there.
That´s just the point.
It doesn´t matter. Not now. Not then.
Look, young man, I don´t know why
you´ve come after me, but I can guess.
Someone has been fiIIing your head...
...with a Iot of sentimentaI cIaptrap
about so-caIIed war crimes and such.
That´s aII nonsense, absoIute nonsense.
How oId are you?
Have you done your miIitary service?
You must have.
You know what the army´s Iike?
A soIdier is given orders.
He obeys those orders.
He doesn´t ask if they are right or wrong.
You know that as weII as I do.
AII I did was to obey my orders.
Don´t compare yourseIf with a soIdier.
You were an executioner.
To put it more pIainIy,
a mass-murderer, a butcher!
-Don´t caII me a butcher!
-Don´t compare yourseIf with a soIdier.
How dare you caII me a butcher!
I was a soIdier. We aII were.
Just Iike the rest.
You young Germans don´t reaIize,
don´t want to understand, what it was Iike.
So teII me.
I´m interested in your point of view.
-You are interested?
-What was it Iike?
What was it Iike?
It was Iike ruIing the worId.
Because we did ruIe the worId,
we Germans.
We had beaten every army
they couId throw at us.
For years they´d Iooked down on us,
and we showed them...
...yes, aII of them,
that we were a great peopIe...
...and we stiII are a great peopIe!
And we of the SS were the eIite.
Of course, they hunt us down now.
First the AIIies and now the wishy-washy
oId women of Bonn.
They want to crush us, they want to crush
the greatness of Germany...
...which we represented and stiII do.
That´s why they divided the country.
You youngsters today...
...don´t reaIize what it means
to be proud of being a German.
You don´t speak for Germany,
not anymore.
No? Look around you at today´s youth.
Strong and heaIthy.
ViriIe. A new generation.
And who created this new generation?
We did, by weeding out
the sickIy and the inferior.
Look at yourseIf.
Strong and heaIthy.
ViriIe. BIonde, bIue-eyed.
That´s what we were working for.
And we succeeded!
You shouIdn´t be criticaI of us.
You shouId be gratefuI.
Sit down in the chair.
You can point that gun at me,
but we´re reaIIy on the same side.
Same destiny. Same peopIe.
Why shouId it matter to you
what happened to a few miserabIe Jews?
Put your gun away, young man,
and go home.
I said, ´´Sit down.´´
Put your hands on the armrests.
Look, Germany was crushed to pieces
in 1945.
And now we are rising again.
SIowIy and sureIy.
And what brings aII this about?
DiscipIine! DiscipIine and management.
Harsh discipIine and harsh management,
the harsher the better.
You see aII this?
The house, the estate, KiefeI EIectric...
...churning out power
and strength each day.
My factory and hundreds of others Iike it.
Who do you think did aII this?
We did!
You shouId be more practicaI, young man.
You shouId be more reaIistic.
You shouId acknowIedge the facts of today.
Whatever prosperity there is
in Germany today...
...has to do with miIIions who work hard
and never murdered anyone in their Iives.
That´s nonsense, absoIute nonsense!
Do you remember a man
with the name of Tauber?
-Who?
-SaIomon Tauber.
He was German and Jewish.
One of your prisoners at Riga.
Try to think, Roschmann.
I can´t remember aII the prisoners´ names.
He died in Hamburg Iast November.
He gassed himseIf. Are you Iistening?
If I must.
Yes, you must.
AII right, I´m Iistening.
-He Ieft behind a diary.
-Is that why you came?
Because of the diary of some oId Jew?
A dead man´s diary is no evidence.
There was a date in the diary
I want to remind you of.
Something that happened at Riga docks...
...on October 11, 1944.
So what? The man struck me.
He disobeyed my orders.
I had the right to commandeer that ship.
Was that the man you kiIIed?
-How shouId I know? It was 20 years ago.
-Was that the man?
AII right! So that was the man. So what?
That was my father.
Your father.
So you didn´t come about the Jews at aII.
I understand.
No, you don´t understand!
What you and your kind did
to aII those peopIe...
...sickened the whoIe of mankind.
-But I´m here for my father.
-But how couId you know?
How couId you possibIy know
from that diary...
...that man was your father?
October 11, the same date, the same pIace.
The Knights Cross
with the oak Ieaf cIuster...
...the highest award for bravery in the fieId.
Given to very few of the rank of captain.
The same rank,
the same decoration, the same man!
I don´t even remember.
You´re not going to kiII me. You can´t.
You caIIed me a butcher.
WouIdn´t kiIIing me
make you a butcher, too?
What´s the difference?
I wouIdn´t be kiIIing a man.
-I´d be kiIIing a--
-Look, I was onIy Commandant...
...untiI November ´43.
Then another man came.
Krause. He took over, Kurt Krause.
-He did aII the kiIIing. It wasn´t me!
-I know what you are, Roschmann.
Look, I agree with you.
That was horribIe, but...
...I didn´t do it,
I couIdn´t even shoot straight.
If you kiII me,
you´d be kiIIing the wrong man.
You´re disgusting.
But I teII you, it was Krause!
You can teII that
to the German peopIe, Roschmann.
-I wiII teII them.
-You´re not even worth a buIIet.
I even have evidence to prove what I say,
a woman wrote to me from New York.
I was onIy in charge there 11 months,
not one hanging or shooting at that time.
But why?
I was held in custody for three weeks
and then released.
I was confused that no serious charge
was ever brought against me.
I didn´t know how much had happened
during the time I was detained.
As a result of Wenzer´s meticulously
accurate record of the Odessa...
...immediate action was taken to bring
many Nazi war criminals to justice.
In the first week of February, 1964...
...the research laboratories at Kiefel
Electric were burned to the ground.
Arson was suspected,
though it was never proved.
But Nasser´s rockets of Helwan never flew.
Finally, in the spring,
old Marx found himself...
...in the Hall of Remembrance in Jerusalem,
saying a prayer...
...for the soul of his good friend,
Salomon Tauber.
I bear no hatred nor bitterness
towards the German people.
Peoples are not evil.
Only individuals are evil.
If, after my death,
this diary should be found and read...
...will some kind friend
please say Kaddish for me?
