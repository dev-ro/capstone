For Hundreds of years in Japan
there has lived a clan...
...who have dedicated themselves to
to a secret art of self-defence
...and survival.
The art is so lethal that
it has made the clan invincible.
To this day, we are known as...
...ninjas.
Twenty-five years ago...
...an ancient legend
of this sacred art came alive.
It spoke of a foreign child
who would come among us...
...and become a ninja master
like none other.
How he arrived on our shores...
...will forever remain a mystery.
We ninjas thought that this child...
...would be the Great White Ninja
of the legend.
We were wrong.
We were very wrong.
Haru!
Haru.
Gobei.
I need your honest opinion
about something.
Yes, sensei.
What do you think of Haru?
I love my brother.
His heart's like a flower.
His determination's like a tiger.
He's fat, a fool
and an embarrassment to ninjas.
Today, I am proud to be your sensei.
This is that special time
when I can say to you...
...you are a ninja.
You can communicate with
other ninjas...
...by projecting yourself
onto the Plane of Enlightenment.
Remember...
...on this plane...
...which can be shared by
no other mortal...
...we can always contact each other
wherever we may be.
As a ninja...
...you are one with the universe.
All of you
who are graduating today...
...will receive the medallion
of the Tengu Warrior.
However, I give the golden medallion
to my finest student.
Gobei.
Forged in the fires
of confidence and discipline.
Carry it with you always.
Sorry, Haru.
Congratulations, big brother.
Wait! Sensei, wait for me!
Sensei, I am so excited about tonight.
I have been waiting
for such a long time!
Tonight's exercise
is for the ninjas only.
But your job is an important one.
You are to remain here
to protect the village...
...and guard the dojo.
I shall do as you say.
I shall protect the village
and guard the dojo.
And I shall water the plants.
Good luck. Good luck.
Stay low so as not to be detected.
Good luck, my brother.
Do not try it.
Are you communicating with me?
Are you communicating with me?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Is this the Takagure dojo?
I'm sorry.
This must be the wrong place.
No! Please do not go.
I mean....
Yes, this is the Takagure dojo.
Oh, thank goodness.
Let me take your...
...shoes.
Thank you.
I was told that
I could find a ninja here.
Really?
Please, sit.
Wait!
Thank you.
That's very impressive.
So are you a ninja?
Yes, I am.
But you're white.
You're observant,
as well as beautiful.
I didn't expect
to find a white ninja.
Do not be fooled by my skin colour.
Have you heard of the white child who
will be the greatest ninja master?
-Is that you?
-Some say it is so.
You see, it is written
in this holy writ.
This holds the teachings
of all ninjutsu...
...that have been passed down
over five centuries.
In this is a legend
about a Great White Ninja?
You see here:
'' In the 16th century
there came to pass--''
It's the wrong writ.
This is about the sensei and twin
geishas. Also a good legend...
...but not the one
we were looking for.
Here is my legend.
'' It's told that
a foreign child will come...
...and become a ninja master
like no other.''
It's burning.
The words are seared
into my soul.
-It's really on fire!
-Yes, I can tell--
They may have a second copy.
Please tell me why you
have come to my dojo.
I warn you that what I'm asking
might be dangerous.
Danger is my companion.
Miss...?
Sally. Sally Jones.
I am Haru.
Do not worry about Haru.
This ninja knows no fear.
You see, I'm a trained master
in all the weapons of battle.
That rack was not built by ninjas.
This, however, was.
Luck is with me...
...for this sacred shrine
holds the ashes...
...of our fallen ninja warriors.
Sensei is going to kill me!
Takure.
Master Go.
Tampo?
Kai?
I think they worked as a team.
Tell me why you are
in need of a ninja.
Ninjas can get into places
without being seen.
What I need requires great stealth.
You are in luck.
My highest grades were in stealth.
Here's an example. Close your eyes,
turn around and count to nine.
When you open them,
I will be gone.
One, two...
...three, four...
...five, six...
...seven, eight...
...nine.
Hello?
Here I am.
Sally Jones, I accept
your dangerous mission.
Oh, that's great.
Thank you.
Here's my problem.
I'm seeing this man.
-You have a man friend.
-I'm suspicious of him.
-He's seeing another woman.
-I think it's bigger than that.
I've discovered he has
a meeting tomorrow.
Excellent.
You too should be a ninja.
Find out what he's up to.
His name's Martin Tanley...
...and he has a limo
with this license plate number.
3-5-1 -0-2.
Where shall I contact you?
It's important that
you don't contact me.
I'll contact you before I leave.
Whatever you wish. I'll follow
your boyfriend, Sally.
My eyes are like
the tentacles of a squid.
Good.
I guess.
Thank you.
Yes! I got you.
Good morning, Mr. Tanley.
Nobu.
It's all set.
They'll meet us here.
Let's have a look at it.
-Oh, yes.
-It's a perfect counterfeit.
One we can duplicate
10 million times.
Martin Tanley,
attack me with your front gate...
...I come in the back door.
Oh, yes. They are beautiful.
-I have some bad news.
-What?
The plates are for
only one side of the bill.
Excuse me?
-The plates are in Los Angeles.
-Why?
-I don't know.
-You're paid to know.
I arranged to get this set of plates.
I just paid a million dollars for
one side of a 10,000 yen bill.
-What good does that do me?
-No good.
Here's some advice
for your next life:
Never take a job you
can't complete.
I'm sorry I posed as a ninja,
but this woman needed my help.
It's you who needs help.
The police believe
a ninja committed a murder.
Believe me, sensei,
I killed no one.
I do believe you, Haru.
But I'm worried.
Don't worry about me.
The woman's in trouble.
Is it likely
that this woman hired you...
...so she could blame
someone for this murder?
She's incapable of such things.
She is as lovely as a dove.
It sounds to me you are being
led around by your short sword.
Gobei called her hotel.
There's no one named Sally Jones.
A woman such as you described
had the name Alison Page.
Perhaps she gave a false name.
Perhaps she gave you the false name.
Believe me.
This woman's telling the truth.
You are unable to tell
truth from untruth.
Impossible.
My ninja intuition tells me this.
You don't have ninja intuition,
or even normal intuition.
My feelings tell me
Sally Jones is in trouble.
I must protect her in America.
What makes you think you can
find her in America?
I have this.
I must go to the hills of Beverly,
and save Sally Jones.
And prove, once and for all,
that I am the Great White Ninja.
I will miss you.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Gobei, I've always looked up to you,
and you've always looked out for me.
But now I'll look out for myself.
Be careful in your travels.
The world is dangerous.
Thank you, big brother.
Though I think it is wrong for you
to make this journey...
...I want you to take this.
Use them only for necessities.
Believe in yourself, my son.
I know you will succeed.
Thank you, sensei.
There is no better father
that a boy could have had.
Go, Haru.
Wait! Wait up!
Goodbye, everyone!
I'm going to miss him.
No, you will not.
Because you are going with him.
No! Please!
Anything but that!
Goodbye, my family!
See you! Don't worry--
You'll be his shadow.
No one can know
you are helping him...
...especially Haru.
Goodbye, everyone!
I'll take your bag.
Empty your pockets, please.
I am sure you'd like to know
who I am and what I do.
But as part of my creed,
I cannot tell you.
My identity must remain
mysterious and my mission secret.
-I cannot reveal it to you.
-Why not?
Because I would then
have to kill you.
Daddy!
Daddy, he said
he was going to kill me!
What'd you say?
I was relating to the child
the importance--
That's it. Grab it.
Thanks, asshole!
You are welcome.
What happened?
The plates were taken
by the gang, Kobudosai.
I want them back.
It's being arranged.
But it's delicate,
not like in Japan.
Nobu, this is Beverly Hills.
Everyone's delicate.
That's why crooks like me
are respected.
-My dear, how was your shopping?
-Good.
Share some lunch?
-May I take your bag?
-Thanks, asshole.
You're welcome, sir.
You see, sensei,
it is all coming together.
Seventy-three minutes to deliver
two suitcases and a garment bag.
Do you have an explanation?
I seem to be coming down with a mild
case of tunnel carpal syndrome.
I think it's from carrying
heavy garment bags.
I don't want to go on disability
and sue the company for millions.
So I figured
I would just pace myself.
Mr. Washington, everything
you do irritates me.
I'm gonna go soak my wrists.
May I help you, sir?
Yes. I am looking for
a Sally Jones.
I'm sorry. I don't see
that name in my computer.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Is the cost of your lodgings great?
Compared to what?
A hut in a rice paddy?
We're a five-star hotel with 800
rooms booked six months in advance.
-I have money.
-I'm sure you do.
-Unfortunately, we don't take wampum.
-Do you take gold?
Front!
Perhaps I shall send
Dom Perignon to your room?
I prefer to be alone tonight.
Perhaps later I'll meet
your friend Don.
1 -A.
My wrists!
What you got in here, car radios?
Here you go, sir.
Welcome to the Rodeo Plaza Hotel.
What are you?
A spy or something?
A spy?
A spy is like a gnat
compared to a ninja.
Ninja?
You're a ninja? Get out of here!
You're a ninja!
Yes, I am a ninja.
I took karate lessons.
I'm not as advanced as you.
I'm a tangerine belt, orange belt.
I'm one of them citrus colours.
You know?
Very admirable.
Then perhaps you'll know...
...what these are.
Man, that was dope!
Are you a third-degree black belt?
My black belt
is like the inside of a coffin...
...on a moonless night.
-That's pretty black.
-It is a black art.
And I, Haru, am the blackest
of the black.
Or, actually,
the Great White, black art...
...blackest master.
Hey, man.
Do you know what I do every day?
-No. What?
-I'm running.
I'm always running.
My neighbourhood's bad.
I run to get cigarettes,
to take out the trash.
You know why?
Whenever I leave my house...
...somebody's waiting
to kick my ass.
Show me a little of what you know.
A kick or a jab. Something.
If I do, give me
your solemn promise...
...not to question my authority.
No problem, man.
I went to Catholic school.
All right then, Joey.
I'll do what I can.
Lesson number one:
Always be on your guard.
Always be on my guard. All right.
You the ninja.
On my guard.
Lesson number two:
Your foe's back can
quickly become his front.
Lesson 34: The technique
for ripping a man's head off...
...is by using your bare hands.
This requires discipline.
Years or decades to achieve.
I suggest that
you practise on chickens.
Chickens?
Ninja secret. Chickens.
Here is what I was looking for, Joey.
A Beverly Hills disguise.
Something simple and natural,
yet subtle and cunning.
You wait here.
I got your back.
-You look like a pimp.
-Thank you.
As a pimp, I'll blend into
the city like MSG into miso soup.
-It's time for me to find my dove.
-How do we do that?
She's rich, beautiful and blond.
How many rich blonds
could there be?
Natural blondes?
I'm in. Let's do it.
We are entering
a dangerous phase.
A mistake could
jeopardize Sally's life.
So what are you saying?
I can't go?
Sally?
Oh, my gosh!
Get away from me, you creep!
I thought we was homies.
You're my boy, my ninja.
-We're like this.
-A ninja master knows best.
You're questioning my authority.
You're right.
-If you need me, I'll be at the hotel.
-Okay. Good work today.
Sally?
Sally Jones!
I mistook you for a friend of mine.
You look like her.
I mean, him.
Up close, you don't look like either.
They are twins.
And they....
This is nice.
Excuse me, I have to be going.
Thank you.
Sally! Sally Jones!
It is I, Haru!
-Why are you here?
-You said you needed a ninja.
I've come many miles
disguised as a pimp to help you.
Just go away.
I'll rescue you.
I don't need to be rescued.
Just leave.
I see. Very smart.
It is better that you
not let them know I am here.
Here, take this.
I discovered your boyfriend is
a counterfeiter and a killer.
You can be sure he's
cheating on you too.
Do not despair.
I will be ever-vigilant.
I'll be watching your every move.
Making sure that as the--
Do not be afraid, my dove.
I will be watching you.
There you are.
We'll see who is the hunter
and who is the prey, Martin Tanley.
Martin Tanley, you have left a trail
a sloth could follow.
Thanks for meeting us, Mr. Ozaru.
-It's best we resolve our differences.
-Perfect agreement.
Cut the bullshit.
How much for your plates?
You have it backwards.
The Kobudosai will buy your plates.
Do you think you can waltz in,
grab the plates and run the show?
You don't have a choice,
Mr. Tanley.
I will know. I will do.
I am one with the universe.
Holy Shinto!
I am one with the universe.
No, I am not...
...one with the universe!
Let's discuss...
...how much we're going to give you...
...for your plates.
Get out!
Holy Shinto!
Help! Police!
No! No!
I did not do it!
This is the site of a gangland
murder in Little Tokyo.
Witnesses say the assailant
had tattoos...
...and may be a ninja.
He matches an Interpol description
of a man wanted in Japan for murder.
Come to papa, baby!
Keep practising, Joey, and some
day you will choke that chicken.
For Pete's sake.
Who is sloppy and messing up?
Getting in the way all the time.
Sensei.
Meditate on me, Haru, and we'll
meet on the Plane of Enlightenment.
Help!
I must concentrate!
-I am one with the universe!
-Here, Haru!
I am here.
I hate this!
Thank you, sensei.
-Hello, my son
-Hello, sensei.
-There's a problem you are facing.
-Not really.
It's just that I have been accused
of another murder...
...or two.
-Come home, Haru.
-I cannot, sensei.
I need your help
finding Sally Jones.
I've considered several techniques.
I could find the names of all
BMW sales...
...checking on all the Joneses,
then visiting them. Or--
You could try a phone book.
A phone book.
-Then resume your quest.
-I will, sensei.
You thought, perhaps,
an experienced ninja...
...would not be ready for you.
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo.
Do not forget that.
I am one with the universe!
I am Haru of the Takagure....
Alison.
Hello, Alison.
-Did Martin say when he'd be back?
-No.
That's strange.
We have business to go over.
It appears Sally's using her
false name with these people.
Very clever, Sally.
You really should be a ninja.
There's something's wrong here.
I am the only one
who is calling her Sally Jones.
How could she do this to me?
Do not move, Alison...Alison Page!
The guards could kill us both.
You are a liar, Sally...
Sally Jones!
I'm sorry that I gave you
a false name.
I only did it so Tanley
wouldn't know I hired you.
Your lies bounce
like Ping-Pong balls.
I am not lying to you, Haru.
In fact, you've helped me.
You found out what I needed to know.
-I did?
-Yes.
Look. My sister Carla
worked for Tanley.
She died mysteriously.
I suspected Tanley, but I couldn't
prove anything until you.
But you're in love with Tanley.
I got involved with him
to find out about Carla.
He doesn't know I'm her sister!
I cannot tell the truth
from the untruth.
There's no time!
If I find the plates, I'll
get him. Believe me!
I do. I've never
stopped believing in you.
You're not alone.
Great White Ninja's on your case.
Thank you, Haru.
Quick! Bedroom, bedroom!
Go! Go!
-What are you doing?
-Looking for you.
I thought I'd make lunch for you.
-I have a meeting.
-Wait!
Let me take you to The Grill.
I can't. Not today.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Hopefully, I'll see you later.
Call a friend.
Have a lovely afternoon.
Since I can't go,
take them to lunch instead.
Have a great meeting. Bye!
Good job!
Thank you.
I don't know what to do.
I can't find those plates.
Do not be disheartened.
I know Tanley's next move.
I have discovered his schedule...
...in this date book.
That's great.
Shrimp? Shrimp?
I gotcha!
Look at this!
Word is out that
what happened could start a war.
They can have a war.
Do not underestimate the Kobudosai.
We're not exactly kittens.
Have you met the ink specialist?
Chet Walters.
I'm told he's the best.
Good. He'll print
the front half of the bill tomorrow.
No complications.
What about this ninja
the police think killed Ozura?
We're lucky there's a suspect.
And a white ninja.
Who ever heard of that?
Tanley's at the first table
on the right.
Please don't!
Do you know how long it took me
to do my hair?
Hurry, my dove!
What's she doing here?
-I know how to get the plates.
-You do?
That's great.
They're coming.
A ninja knows when he's in danger.
Shoot them!
Now we are in danger.
We are really in danger!
I'm one with the chicken.
Keep practising, Joey.
Where...?
Thank you for letting me
stay here.
It is my pleasure, Alison.
Besides, there is no place
for you to go.
Stay here. Tanley will be
watching you.
Especially your apartment.
I'll protect you
with all of my being.
I'm so lucky I found you.
You really are courageous.
If only I had caught Tanley in Japan.
Today, you'd be basking in the
safety of our dojo...
...where I'd bring you
soap and sweet-smelling oils...
...that you could rub
all over your body.
And then--
I am sorry. I got carried away.
It's okay.
Your loyalty is most appreciated.
Well, I guess it's time to turn in.
-Do you want the bed or the couch?
-Which would you prefer?
Couch is fine for me.
That would be fine for me too.
Good night.
Good night.
Don't worry, he's an ink specialist
and suspects nothing.
As we talked about,
you'll distract him...
...and I'll use the ninja sleephold...
...to incapacitate him.
Are you ready?
Yeah, let's go.
Welcome to Beverly Hills Bank Note.
I'm Chet Walters. Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?
I'm kidding.
What can I do you for?
Our car broke down.
Mind if I use your phone?
Don't get me started
on car problems.
I got a 1975 Fairmont.
It's about as hard
to turn over as me on Laguna Beach.
I'm just bugging with you.
Auto Club is 555-9300.
Thank you.
Yep, the AAA.
I knew a guy who started off
in AAA, then ended up in AA.
He got busted for DUI.
Hello, is this the Auto Club?
What are you doing?
Are you not familiar with
shiatsu massage?
Shiatsu? Watch your language.
A lady's present.
When I played ball
in Wisconsin...
...these cheerleaders
lathered me up like a whale--
Get off me!
I'm calling the cops.
Give me the phone!
-Not a ninja technique, but effective.
-Put him in the back.
What're you doing?
Preparing a great ninja tool:
The laughing mushroom.
One pinch and he'll
tell the truth about Tanley.
Careful, Alison.
The effects are profound.
Open his mouth.
I'm involved in
counterfeiting some money!
Big deal!
If I get caught...
...I could do 30 years.
Tanley is a killer!
He killed her sister.
When he's done,
he'll probably kill you!
-When are you to meet him?
-Ten minutes.
If you're here when he gets here,
he'll kill us all!
-I don't think we should.
-I'm sorry. I was....
I wasn't trying to....
I was merely trying to get close
to the temple, not inside.
I just wanted to climb the steps...
...and maybe peek at
the sacred object.
Hey, how you doing?
Chet Walters. Mr. Tanley?
Nice jacket.
Who shot the couch?
Very funny, Mr. Walters.
Ready to go?
You bet! Your buggy or mine?
Mine, I think.
Gotta get the gear.
Can't start an operation
without the gear.
Here we are,
off to the wild blue yonder.
You don't mind.
A small precaution.
No, if you feel more comfortable.
How will you drive with that on?
-It's for you.
-Of course it is.
Pin the Tail on the Donkey!
Who's got the piñata?
Hear about the lady who backed
into a fan? Dis-assed-her!
-I don't care.
-You bet.
Gotcha. You betcha.
Alrighty. Here we go!
You pick up guys
and do this all the time?
Who's driving this buggy?
Let me guess. Don't tell me.
Carol Channing.
Mind if I borrow this next week?
I got a blind date. A blind date!
Which way's he going?
Through the Grand Canyon?
Where did he learn to drive?
Cooking schooI?
Thank God we made it!
Okay, let's take the blindfold off.
That's what she said. She said!
You think I ought to
work before you pay me?
It's the real bill.
Print a proof copy today.
Exactly like this.
No problem.
Hold the phone a second.
Old Faithful!
Sure you don't want it sooner?
They don't call me the best
for nothing.
I'm in a thong Speedo,
hiking boots and a backpack.
You get a ride on 83rd Avenue, dressed
like that in the middle of winter.
What happened?
A bug must've bit me.
My brother's in pest control.
Bring him over...
...he'll nuke every
cockroach and mosquito in this dump.
Could we please get to work?
I see you got the T-200
split-level Barber ink printing press.
I printed leaflets
for the ''Shave the Whale'' campaign.
-''Save the Whale.''
-That's what you did with them?
Nobu, keep an eye on him.
Maybe it was ''Starve the Whales'' !
Let's see what we got
baking in the oven.
Not yet a match.
It looks like we are
one degree Celsius off...
...on that magenta colour.
I'm gonna have to
quantify the 7-F reading on this...
...and that'd run it through
with the surface-gravity viscosity.
I can plug it into
the Marshall formula...
...and that would give me
an accurate mix design.
They're just a little bit off.
What I could do on that is run
a Pap smear...
...and then tone it down a little.
-Hello, Mr. Tanley.
-What the hell is that?
See what I'm up against?
I'll rethink my inks.
So...
...what I could do is,
I could swing back to my shop...
...and be gone five minutes.
You could blindfold me.
I liked that anyway.
How'd that get in there?
Who are you?
Chet Walters, ink specialist.
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo...
...and if you value your life,
you will....
Let's get him!
Open this door!
Let us out of here!
Haru, you are truly
the Great White Ninja.
Did I say ninja?
I meant ninny.
'' Haru, you are such a ninny.''
Where's Walters?
Subject me to any torture
you can think of...
...but a ninja does not talk.
Ninja? You're a ninja?
You're the fat ninja
everyone's talking about.
Great White Ninja.
The meeting with the Kobudosai
is arranged.
Good. Tie him
and throw him in the van.
Get rid of him later.
Check your guns.
Kobudosai checked theirs.
My dove!
Are you all right?
I am fine.
Let me get this blindfold off.
It is in the spirit of harmony
we meet here today.
It is important to our community
an agreement be reached.
Stop squirming!
I'm undoing these ropes.
A ninja visualizes
the straightness of the rope.
It will begin to untie itself.
Or a knife is good.
I suggest that you
make your plates our plates.
Honoured elder?
You know I have great respect
for you, Kumagi...
...but I rule in favour of Mr. Tanley.
-You won't get away with this!
-Yes, I will.
These criminals will face
the justice system.
Be careful.
-Where's the ninja?
-I don't know.
Never mind.
That's right.
The Little Tokyo Temple.
Stop the van.
Stop the van!
What a coincidence.
Can I give you a lift?
Help me!
Hands in the air!
It's him! The white ninja!
Do not shoot!
I am on your side.
Let's get him!
Come on over here.
Get out of here!
I got him!
Open the door.
Keep his head down.
Alison, what have I done?
He's an idiot!
I cannot do this anymore.
I had to escape from jail!
I am coming home.
-Do not be rash, Gobei.
-Rash?
He's made every mistake
in the ninja book.
He is coming.
Hide behind those clouds.
I hate this!
-Hello, Haru.
-Hello, sensei.
How are you, my son?
-I have tried, but I have failed.
-That is never true.
I want so desperately to be
a great ninja like Gobei, but--
Stop comparing
yourself to Gobei.
Why, sensei?
He is the best ninja ever.
I hope that he knows that I love him.
All I wanted was his respect.
My son...
...we would all be lucky
to have a heart as big as yours.
In fact, Gobei will not become...
...a great ninja,
until he learns that lesson.
I tried to stop this mission
because I feared for you.
But I was wrong.
You must continue.
-I must?
-Yes.
Go. Save Alison.
It is your duty as a ninja.
You just called me a ninja.
Yes, I guess I did.
Go now.
I can do it.
Patrice, my car.
Joey, come with me.
Who is stealing my shoes?
-There's no time to waste.
-I'm with you.
-Thanks, asshole.
-My pleasure.
-What are we doing?
-Using my ninja memory...
...I will re-create the trip
to Tanley's warehouse.
Drive, Joey.
Phat! I get to drive?
All right. Come on.
We going like Morgan Freeman.
Now turn right.
There was a bump. Good.
There was a right after a bump.
Right after the bump.
Take off the blindfold!
What's wrong with you?
I know just where we are.
We're on the right track.
We're on the track, all right!
I do not remember hearing thunder.
There's gotta be a turn somewhere!
-Turn right, now!
-I'm turning!
This is good. I hear water.
Now turn right.
Now left, towards the water. Yes!
I think we're too close to the water.
I think we should go back.
-You led us astray.
-I didn't!
I cannot swim! Joey!
We're drifting!
Something's touching my face!
Joey, these sea creatures!
Help me!
-Head towards the mainland!
-Mainland?
Yes, the mainland!
The sea is foamy.
You have wandered way off-course!
America's weather
fluctuates violently.
Maybe we should go for cover.
Joey, what is that smell?
-Piña colada.
-I like it.
-Listen to my directions.
-I'm going where you said!
If you cannot, I will have to drive.
-You must listen at all times.
-I'm sorry.
We must try again.
And this time, you must
follow my directions exactly.
Okay, no problem.
-I'm ready.
-My entire family likes to drive--
You may drive now.
You may drive now.
Consider yourself very lucky.
You've lived longer than
anyone who's betrayed me.
I brought you a present.
A little bang.
You'll vaporize
before you feel a thing.
I wish I'd killed you months ago.
The feeling's mutual.
The difference is...
...I'm able to rectify my mistake.
Somebody help me!
Do not let up. We are
nowhere near our destination.
Take a left. Joey!
Why are we stopping here?
So we have entered
the serpent's lair.
You are a fragile boy.
Thank God I have a short sword.
Yeah!
Yeah, you go, ninja boy!
Yeah! Mr. Dojo Rising!
Go for it!
I made it.
If it isn't
the Great White Ninja.
Welcome. Congratulations on
coming this far...
...but this is where
your legend ends.
Only when I have ceased to breathe
will I be dead.
Get rid of him.
-Why are you here?
-I come to help you.
This is my dream.
Let us kick some yakuza ass!
That's right. I can climb.
I can climb!
So sorry, Gobei.
You should go save Alison.
-Can you manage without me?
-I will try.
Somebody help me!
Alison, is that you?
Yes! Help me!
All right!
Hurry!
Please hurry!
Stop!
Can you come closer?
I'll untie you.
There's no time.
There's a bomb in here.
Have no fear.
I will defuse the bomb.
I can see now.
It is simple.
-Do you know what you're doing?
-There, I have done it!
Your call cannot be completed
as dialled.
Please check the number
and dial again.
Oh, great.
-We've lost five minutes.
-Oops.
Brother!
My dove, hang on!
How much time is left?
Four minutes.
Do not worry.
I will return.
I may not be the best ninja
or one with the universe.
But I'll tell you this:
No one messes with my brother!
Go! Yeah!
Look out!
So sorry.
Here I come!
Are you all right, my brother?
Yes, Haru.
Nicely done, Joey.
Hurry!
Martin Tanley.
I'm over here.
Now you're out of bullets.
Look out!
Come on!
Do not worry.
Forty seconds.
Get out of there!
-Thirty seconds!
-Hang in there, my dove.
In a moment, you'll be
as free as a bird.
Are we dead?
You did it.
-I did?
-Yes.
Thank you, Haru.
Thank you.
I cannot say this has been
an easy mission.
You are the greatest ninja
of all time.
Believe it or not, I doubted myself.
What a fool I was.
Thanks, big brother.
It's all right.
-You did good.
-Thank you, big brother.
Sorry about your head.
I was going for Tanley.
A group of ninjas foiled an
attempted counterfeiting operation.
I am live with
one of those ninjas.
This may be odd, but I
thought ninjas were Japanese...
...and you seem to be black.
Don't be fooled by my skin colour.
You're a TV reporter.
You've heard of
the Great Black Ninja?
-No. Is that you?
-Some say it is so.
You have done well, Haru.
I am proud.
Great White Ninja or not,
you made me believe in myself.
Though it will sadden me to see you
leave, I am happy for you.
I know I will be of better
use where there's no great ninjas.
I'll go with my dove to the land
of opportunity, Beverly Hills.
Whether you're the chosen one or not,
I'd fight alongside you.
Here.
Good luck, my brother.
My arm!
It's okay.
Alison and I must leave.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye!
It's amazing.
I think he's really changed.
Stop!
Stop! Are you listening--?
Give me my medallion back!
Hi, Gobei.
I am sorry, big brother!
