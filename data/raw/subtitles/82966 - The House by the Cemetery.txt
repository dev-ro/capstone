Steve?
Steve,
are you dressed?
Come on...It's late.
I gotta get home.
I don't wanna get put
on restriction again.
Steve
Steve?
Are you there?
Listen, if you're trying
to scare me
I don't think it's very
funny.
This place gives me the
creeps.
Steve. I warn you.
I'll never
come here with you again.
Steve...
Come on. Where are you?
If you don't quit it,
I swear I am gonna split
without you.
Steve...
Steven, where are you?
Please, answer me
Steve!
Bob?
Bob
Bob, where are you?
Bob?
Honey, you still have to
pack away your toys.
Now, which ones are you
gonna take with you?
Bob, I'm talking to you.
Bob...
Bob...
Will you please wake up
when Daddy gets home...
Mom
What's the matter?
Mom, why does that girl keep
telling me I shouldn't
go there?
What girl Bob?
The one standing at the
window in that house.
At the window?
We don't have time to play
games, honey.
Daddy will be home
any minute.
Now, where's the....
I guess she had something to
do.
Let's just say you never saw
her in the first place,
all right?
Yes I did...I saw her face.
She was waving.
I could read her mouth.
And did she say anything
to you?
She said that
I shouldn't go over there.
Why did she saythat Mom?
Well, I don't know Bobby.
Maybe because she
didn't want you to pack
away your toys the
way you're supposed to.
Come on lazy bones.
Let's get the lead out.
I wasn't tricking you Mom.
Honest.
May...
May
Time to go May.
Time to go home.
No, I can't go now.
It's important.
I can't.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Lucy still hasn't
made up her mind.
You have a lot of guts
picking up the reigns
of someone else's
research at it's most
critical point.
Especially when that
someone else was a scientist
of Eric Peterson's caliber.
I tell you boy.
You're the only man who
can keep this project from
going down the drain.
Apart from the 5000 more
you're going to be earning
per year.
You were Peterson's protege
and also I believe,
one of his best friends.
I know you are itching to
clear up his suicide.
Tough one to explain.
But I know you'll get to the
bottom of it.
Well, I'll try.
The important is that when
this huge project gets
published, it'll have just
your name on it.
Think what authorship
can mean.
Yeah, publish or perish.
What do you think Eric
would have done
in a situation like that?
Well, I don't know.
No idea.
Apprehensions?
Yeah
It's scary.
He organized the project
Got it underway
And then for no reason...
And abandoned everything...
Slaughtered his mistress
And there he was,
researching suicide.
The times we have to live in
Taxi...
Well boy, when school's over
I'll drive up there to see
ya.
I adore New England.
I'll be looking forward to
it, sir.
Bye bye.
Norman, why my plants?
Pennie's gonna water them.
They're pretty
Oh, for good's sake.
New England's full of plants
Be careful. Give it to me.
I don't trust Penny.
What do you think?
Everything here?
I think it's all here
But I really don't know how
we're gonna fit it all in
Think positive.
Bythe way,
have you been to see
Mrs. Peterson?
No.
No need to.
All his reference material
is right there in
the library.
Well, after all, he was a
colleague of yours.
Let's just say we worked
in the same field.
But darling, you could have
at least gone to pay
your condolences.
What do you say to a widow
whose husband had
another woman and one fine
day slaughtered that other
woman after which he hanged
himself?
Then, after Mom changed her
mind the 10th time,
the place was already rented
So, where are we gonna live?
In an ever-nicer place,
thanks to professor Mueller.
Otherwise, you sleep in a
tent.
I wish
Welcome to New Withfield,
Tired?
No, a little nervous.
Come on.
You're gonna love it.
Smell that country air.
No...No...Don't do it...
There's the agency.
Stay right where you are,
Bobby.
We'll be back in a minute,
okay?
Will you get some Candy?
After dinner if you're a
good boy.
I'm so late.
I'm sorry.
Mr. and Mrs. Boyle?
How do you do?
I'm Laura Gidles.
Nice to meet you.
Okay.
You could always start to
fill this out and sign it.
Sit down please.
I'm gonna get the keys for
you.
Okay.
I don't know exactly where
I put them..... But l....
...yes
Anyway, you can move in
as soon as you want.
We haven't had much
time to clean it up.
I'm sure you too will
find it very comfortable.
Your brother said it was
easy to clean,
they did tell you it was
the same house didn't they?
In any case
Poor Dr. Peterson had been
there such a short while
Of course, you've been there
before haven't you, Dr.Boyle
No.
Get the keys, Harold.
Would you please?
What keys?
The Freudstein keys.
Oak Mansion Harold.
Yeah, sure, okay.
Oak Mansion.
Excuse me, John.
I didn't mean to keep you
waiting.
Well, how do you find
our little village?
It's not exactly New York,
but I am sure
you'll grow to like it.
I hope so.
Bob...
Bob
I'm here.
Behind you.
On the other side of the
street.
Hello.
Hello
My name is May.
I've been expecting you.
My name is Bob
My dad is here to do
some research.
Yeah, I know.
However,
I thought I told you
very clearly not to come.
I did my best
only Mommy wouldn't
listen to me.
Parents never listen
They always do what
they want.
You shouldn't have come, Bob
So now
You two just follow me.
That's my car over there.
Where is.....?
Mrs. Gidelsen, hold on a
second.
Mommy...Mommy!
I saw the girl from
the white house.
Why did you get out of the
car?
See the doll she gave me
to play with.
She wanted to talk.
She lives here too you know.
I told you to stay there
and not to move!
But she called to me.
They promised to come
by Friday at the latest.
I guess that about does it.
Thank you very much.
Not at all.
My pleasure.
Well, I hope you'll enjoy
your stay and your research,
Mr. Boyle.
Thank you.
I hope so too.
And don't worry.
As soon as l
get back to town
I'll find you that
babysitter.
That's very kind of you.
If there's anything else,
you know where to find me.
Okay.
Damn tombstone.
Well, house in the woods,
quiet.
You're right.
Shades of Warden Pond
Norman.
This house is exactly like
the one in your photo
in New York.
Yes, it's possible.
It's typical example of
the local architecture.
There are probably hundreds
of houses like it in
the area.
You ready?
Don't you wanna
unload the car?
You've got 6 months
to contemplate nature.
Everyone to the starting
line.
And they're revving up.
And they're off...
Here we go.
Now you have water
in the kitchen.
You know
I was thinking
Maybe Bob and I should
have stayed in New York.
Oh for god's sake, again.
Stop this, please.
After all 6 months
goes by real quick,
doesn't it?
Come on.
Don't you remember.
We decided it'd be
a vacation.
I do my reaserch and you
and Bob can go out.
It's beautiful.
Great place for a vacation,
isn't it?
Listen honey.
It means
another $5000 per year.
Do you realize...
We can refurnish
the apartment in New York.
What's the matter?
It's only a doll.
Bob's always bringing
home that trash.
You're just tired, darling.
You really should take those
pills your doctor prescribed
Why do you keep telling me
to go on with those pills?
I feel fine.
I've never felt better.
Calm down your
nerves.
My nerves are fine
the way they are.
Besides...
I read somewhere that those
pills can
provoke hallucinations.
Are you sure?
Well...
You can't say
the house isn't quaint.
I guess this must be the
cellar.
And Mrs. Gidelsen had the
door nailed shut, quaint.
Say the word
and I'll open it for you.
No.
Go and fix the rooms first.
Tonight I'd rather sleep
in a real bed.
Wouldn't you?
Alright.
Bob
Bob look, it's time for nap,
honey.
No. I wanna play.
Don't whine.
Hi...
Hi.
Are you Mrs. Boyle?
Yes
Mrs. Gidelsen sent me over.
I'm Anne, the babysitter.
Anne
No. It's alright.
You keep the car.
But you'll need it to get
home.
Really. It's okay.
I can take a bus.
But they only
leave once an hour
and you have the groceries.
I don't have much to get
and I feel like a walk.
Who can argue?
Okay. I'll take the car.
Hi...
Who was it?
Mrs. Gidleson.
She didn't see me
Or she turned the other way
on purpose.
Or maybe you need glasses.
Maybe.
Are you on top of it?
Yeah. I feel a little bit
better,
now that I know that Ann is
looking after Bob.
A candle light dinner.
Okay.
In the last two months,
not only did he come in
less and less
but he acted differently.
I had the impression he was
growing obsessively jealous
of Sheila.
Dr. Boyle, you will pardon
my indiscretion.
Please
What was he so eager to
discuss with you back then?
Back when?
When you came to visit
him with your daughter.
Don't you remember?
Last October, I think it was
I never paid a visit to
Dr. Petersen.
In fact, this is the
first time I've set foot
in this town.
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.
Positive.
And then I have a son,
not a daughter.
Strange. I could have sworn.
Mr. Weekly, you called me.
Our precious Daniel Douglas.
If you need any books,
documents,
reference material of any
kind,
feel free to call on our
Mr. Douglas.
Thank you.
Everything's the way
Dr. Petersen left it.
Those are his notes.
I didn't dare move
any of his materials.
Are you going to carry on
Dr. Petersen's research?
Of course.
Over here you'll
find all the medical reports
death certificates,
and lists of missing persons
What did Petersen need
that material for?
I don't know.
He asked me to get it.
I told him that...
The material
wasn't pertinent.
And?
He answered that he was
doing a little
private research.
Do you know anything about
it?
No.
But knowing Petersen I'm
sure it's
something fascinating.
Well...
If you need me,
I'm in the next room.
Thank you.
You know where he
hanged himself?
There, from that railing.
Do you know who
that lady is, Bob?
She was the wife of
Dr. Freudstein.
Who was Dr. Freudstein?
Oh, it's all a lie.
What's all a lie?
She's really not buried
there.
Oh, I know.
She's not buried there.
June 7th 1879,
Dr. Jacob Allan Freudstein
is hereby suspended from the
medical association
and banned from practicing
the medical profession for
life.
Bob?
Anne?
Is that you?
Bob?
Anne?
Bob?
Anne?
I'm home!
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy...
What in God's name?
What's wrong?
Lucy.
Lucy...
Hi.
How do you feel?
Better.
Have Bob and Anne
come back?
Not yet.
Why can't we get something
else from Mrs. Gidleson?
I mean this house is so
strange.
Sure I can deal with
a grave yard next door,
but to live with
a tomb in your hallway...
It's just something you'll
have to get used to.
This ain't New York
I know.
Most of the old houses
in the area have Tombs
in them.
Really.
No kidding...
It's because in the winter
it freezes here
Is that so?
And the yard
being like a rock
they bury grandpa at home.
No more ghost talk now.
Come on.
I've got a surprise for you.
What is it?
I did some
clever scrounging and,
well darling, now we try to
solve the cellar
door mystery.
Nope.
We're home Mrs. Boyle.
Daddy...Daddy...
You're back from work!
Guess what.
What.
Today I saw my new
Girlfriend again.
And they said to
tell you "Hi" and also Mommy
Hey. What are you doing?
I want to show Mommy
there's nothing behind
the door.
How about giving me a hand.
Sure...
This one didn't match,
you try one.
Did you see the girl he was
talking about?
No.
Weren't you with him?
Yes.
All the time?
I've found it.
Only trouble is...
Rusty as all get out.
Obviously, Mrs. Petersen
wasn't interested in cellars
It must have been years
since...
Do you see anything?
Some old steps going down.
Should I come with you?
No.
Stay with Bob.
Norman...
Anne!
Why did you shout like that?
It was just...
Norman...Help me!
Daddy...Daddy...
What's the matter?
I see.
I'll tell Mrs. Gidleson.
Please tell her
we want to move out
no later than tomorrow.
Yes, very well.
Well, would it be...
...be difficult
to find another house?
I can't really say,
but I don't think so.
Thank God for that.
Don't forget now,
no later than tomorrow.
Okay.
Very well.
I'll call Mrs. Gidleson and
have her stop over
this evening.
Good bye
That Freudstein house
That Freudstein house...
No.
No.
It was inevitable.
What?
That they want to leave
the Freudstein property.
Oak Mansion Harold.
How many times
do I have to tell you Harold
that the house is now called
Oak Mansion.
Yeah, give the bad product a
new label.
Well, call it what you will,
but it has always been
Freudstein's house.
May
May
May
We have to.
I suppose so.
What're you doing
by the window?
Watching the house,
that's all.
You can't see it from here.
Come.
Time to go to bed
Don't go inside.
Not inside.
Mr. Boyle?
Mrs Boyle?
Is anybody home?
Mrs. Boyle?
Anne?
Hello?
Anne?
Anne?
Mrs. Boyle
Anne
Good Morning, Anne.
Good Morning.
What are you doing?
I made coffee.
What a shame you didn't come
with us to the restaurant
Iast night.
Well...
At least your parents must
be glad you paid them
a visit?
Do you live far from here?
Good morning, professor.
Norman.
Yeah?
That girl is a real weirdo.
I can't get a word out of
her.
Maybe she doesn't like me.
Is it interesting?
What?
Did you find anything
interesting?
I don't know.
Peterson was reading up
about a certain
Dr. Freudstein
Turn of the century surgeon
who had a pension for
illegal experiments.
What did they have to do
with his
historical reasearch?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
The best guess
I can come up with,
was that Peterson already
was going off the deep end.
Honey.
Yeah.
That's why I have to take
a trip to New York.
Today?
Yeah
I need Millers okay to
follow up a hunch
Which is that Petersen's
suicide was somehow
connected with his research
on the surgeon Freudstein
Oh, it's you.
Surprised?
Well it's Sunday
And I thought...
I know
What are you doing here?
Nothing
Just a routine check
One of my duties is to check
all of the wings in the
Iibrary on sundaywhen we're
closed.
I won't disturb you any
longer
Excuse me.
Gotcha!
Only because I fell.
Otherwise you wouldn't
have come near me.
Where are you going?
I have to get home or
Mommy will yell at me.
Mom's shopping and she still
thinks
I'm up in my room napping.
No, she won't get mad.
I tell you she will cause
Mommy
told me I was not to go out.
Don't go in the house, Bob.
Don't worry.
I'll just fake it a minute
or two
and then sneak out again.
See ya.
Wait for me.
Under the oak
- Okay
No Bob. Don't go inside.
I warned you not to.
It's been days and days
since I stopped work
for this.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
I can't stop now though.
I got to.....
I've lost all critical
perspective.
The signs.
The warnings of this
house, Freudsteins house.
That anguished crying,
and Sheila smiles.
What can I do to
make her believe me?
Maybe I'm insane.
Yes, this is all unreal.
Freudstein's house, draws
me like and infernal magnet
and frightens me..
How many have wandered
innocently
into the waiting spider web?
How many more are doomed to
follow?
The smell of the rooms
terrifies me
And lures me on.
The smell of blood.
How many more still to come?
Onward into the depth of
this mystery.
I want to know.
Know the worst...
Onward...
Find out...
Find out...
Freudstein!
His voice.
Is that his voice?
Blood...
Blood
Not only blood.
His voice.
I hear it now
I hear it
I hear it everywhere.
He's here...
Do you believe me now?
Do you believe me?
No...
No...
Not the children.
No...
And they're on the starting
grid set for the big race,
Yogi.
On your marks.
Go!
Bob
Where are you?
Answer me.
Come on.
Quit playing.
Bob.
Are you down there?
Bob
You alright?
Do you want me to come down
and help you?
Bob
Is that you?
Bob?
Please answer me.
Bob
Open the door...
The door, Bob...
Open the door!
Help me...
Open the door
Bob, open the door
Open the door
Help...
Somebody help me.
Okay, Yogi?
We've got to rescue Anne!
Anne?
Anne
Anne
Anne?
Bob
Anne
Can you help me?
Bob?
Anne?
Bob
Bob
Mommy...
Bob
Mommy
What's the matter?
What are you doing here,
darling?
It was awful.
Where's Anne?
What happened?
I don't know.
Were you playing?
You mean she was hiding?
You got scared or what?
I was racing and I heard
this scream and I went
down to the cellar and.....
And?
And they cut off Anne's head
He did Mommy.
It fell down the stairs
and its laying there.
I saw it.
I did.
Bob, really
It's true Mommy.
It's alright.
You really scared me,
you know that?
It's the truth Mommy.
Honest.
I saw it roll down
the stairs.
Bob.
There's nothing there.
Believe me.
Hey
Hey
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I happen to be the caretaker
and we're closed now.
I'm looking for a tomb.
Whose tomb?
A Dr. Freudstein's.
Ah, you too?
What do you mean?
Well, you're not the first.
Look friend, I came over
200 miles
to see this tomb and I want
to see it.
Well, you shouldn't have
bothered.
There is no Dr. Freudstein
here.
But...
According to the
official records
he was buried here.
The official records don't
mean a thing.
It's a lot of bunk that
Freudstein is buried here.
Just gossip.
Now come on.
The cemetery is closed.
Let's go.
Do you mind?
Thanks Mommy.
Anne will come back.
You'll see.
She's probably just gone
to visit her parents.
That's all.
Go to sleep now.
Come on.
There we are.
It's late.
Anne.
Mommy says you are not dead.
Is that true
Anne
Are you there?
Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
Mommy
Help me out...
Mommy...
Open the door for me...
It's scary in here...
Don't worry, honey.
Let me out of here...
I'm scared!
Stay calm.
Mommy will get you out.
Mommy
Hurry
I'm scared.
Use the key like Daddy did.
I don't want to stay in here
Just a minute.
I'm coming.
Mommy!
Keep calm
Okay...
I'm there
Turn.
Mommy.
Open the door.
Mommy...Open the door.
I know...I know
Wait a minute.
Open the door
There's someone in here,
Mommy.
There's somebody in here...
Get the door open...
He's coming to get me!
Mommy...
Lucy...
What's the matter?
Mommy...
Is Bob in there?
Yes.
We've got to get him out
right now
And leave this house fast.
What do you mean?
- Later...
Where's the ax?
Where's the damn ax?
Bobby.
Keep away from the door!
Yes, I will!
Don't worry Bob...
I'll get you out.
Why? Who's in there?
Who's in this house?
Dr. Freudstein!
Peterson found out the truth
That's why he killed himself
What?
Bob
It was Freudstein that
killed Sheila.
No...
He needs human victims to
renew his cells.
That's how he stays alive.
Bob...
Norman
Bob...
The steps
Quickly
Hurry
Mommy...
May...
Bob
May
Time to go home and
remember your manners.
Surely you can act like
a Freudstein.
You know some other guest is
surely destined to drop in.
