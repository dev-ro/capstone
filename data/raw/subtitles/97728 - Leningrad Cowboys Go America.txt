It's shit.
-How come?
No commercial potential.
Go to America.
They'll put up with anything there.
Call my cousin.
Hotel Mansfield, Manhattan.
Pekka stayed out
rehearsing last night.
By morning,

And you want to collect the reward.
-Yes.
We have to go to America.
Grandfather went there, too.
Nobody's heard from him since.
I'll pay for your trip.
Take his body with you
and show him the world.
Go away.
A few words before we go.
Only American bands
can play in America.
From now on, you are one.
In America,
everybody speaks English.
You do, too.
Those of you who can't,
better learn it.
I don't want to speak English.
Success has gone to Vladimir's head.
Without us...
Shut up.
