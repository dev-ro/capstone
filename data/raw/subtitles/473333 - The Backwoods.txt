- Everything all right, Lucy?
- This heat's wiping me out.
Open the window down if you like.
Forget it, it's even hotter outside.
At least there's not much traffic.
I'm not surprised. Who'd want
to go out on a day like this?
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
Do you still have a headache?
Yeah. It keeps coming and going,
it won't get out.
Smoking is not gonna help it.
Cigarettes are the only thing
that eases it a bit.
Don't worry so much about me.
All I need is a good night's sleep.
Could you pass me one
of those cigarettes, please?
Just soak up that peace and quiet.
Little stop.
Lost in the civilization
for a couple of days.
Let's see and stretch our legs.
Yeah, yeah, good idea.
Are you coming?
No, thanks.
I'm sick of following him.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, go on, I'll be fine.
- What is this place?
- I've never stopped here before.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.
- Are you coming?
- I'm shattered.
The less we get caught up,
the sooner we'll get there.
Women are not so enthusiastic.
- Yours isn't coming either?
- No.
Hello!
We'll have a couple of glasses
of vino.
Oh, that's all we fucking need!
Lester!
Hello.
Hello.
Two wines, please.
Goddam foreigners.
They just learn Spanish
to get drunk.
It isn't nice to laugh at visitors.
- He got you there!
- Just pour us another round!
After I've served these gentlemen.
- Hello.
- Good morning.
Where's our wine?
It's coming.
- English?
- Yes.
You speak Spanish well.
My grandmother was from this area.
She married my grandfather
and they went to live in England.
I'm almost a local.
A local!
What was your grandmother's name?
Begoña, Begoña Coloma.
I remember your grandmother,
and the Englishman.
They lived in the house
by the river.
- But it's abandoned now.
- Not anymore.
I bought the house a year ago.
It's mine now.
Who are they?
English people.
Careful, Lechón. One of them
speaks Spanish, right, Antonio?
Leave the bottle.
Two nights ago, lightning hit a tree
and it fell across the road.
So, to get to
your grandmother's house,
take the track that
goes out of the village,
to the left.
- The left?
- Yes, the left.
If those layabouts
weren't in here all day,
the road would be clear now.
Fuck!
Paul, we should be going,
it's getting late.
Yeah.
We have to go.
Thanks for the directions.
I'll pay for this.
No. I pay this time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- That car won't make it.
- What?
It won't last a mile.
You should all go in the other one.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
You were taking forever.
The old boy thinks
we should all go in my car.
Says this one won't make it
along the track.
I'm not leaving this here,
no way.
I'd listen to him. They have good
instincts about stuff like that.
The car'll be fine.
Let's go.
I hope it's still there
when I get back.
Who's going to steal it here?
It's safe enough.
It better be.
You want to get yourself one of this?
Takes you anywhere you want,
you fell like in a tank,
it's safe as a house and there's
plenty of room for the kids.
We're almost there.
Do you see the river?
Down there.
- What do you think?
- I think it's great.
I try to work on it
every chance I can.
And what about the location?
You feel you can really breathe.
Why don't you open the door
and we can show them the inside?
Good idea.
You're incapable of enjoying nature
even for a minute, are you?
Thank you, I think we're going
to get sick of it.
Here, take it, come on boy.
Look at this beauty.
I got this last year.
Feel how smooth it is.
If you two aren't going to help,
you can at least get out of the way.
So, what do you think
of the sitting room?
- You converted this?
- Yeah! It used to be the stables.
Do you still think
this is a crazy idea?
I'm telling you, you should
come and live here.
We could set up a company again,
like we did in London...
Are you two going to start
talking about work again?
You've been going on
about that all week.
Well, if it's bothering him, then he
should say something, shouldn't he?
Bother... no, no.
Did I miss something?
I was about to finally
convince your husband
that you should move here.
Thank you, but I think
I prefer civilization.
Oh, You too?
I support the motion!
You don't want to end up like
in The Little House on the Prairie.
God forbid it.
Don't say my darling
Michael Landon has got angry.
- It's freezing in here.
- Yeah, come on, get in here, quick.
I feel awful.
I'm completely exhausted.
- Yeah, too many kilometres.
- Too much Paul.
- And she's so nice...
- Don't be like that.
You know he's investing a lot
in this place.
Oh, that's better,
it feels so good lying down.
It sounds like they've made it up.
Just as well. I couldn't take
another supper like that one.
- Shall we turn off the light?
- Sure.
Things are going to be a bit better
when we get some time on our own.
We've been travelling by car for a
week. I can't take any more driving.
- You don't really feel like it?
- No it's not that, but...
Look, I can't think right now,
let's talk about it tomorrow, ok?
Yeah.
Listen to that.
- They'll hear us.
- Is it him or her? I can't tell.
Really, I'm tired and I've still
got an awful headache.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I feel uncomfortable.
Shit, Norman, I said no.
I thought a change of air
would do us both good.
Do you think that things are
different just because we're here?
Do you feel different?
Because I don't.
- What do you feel?
- You know how I feel.
No, I don't know.
I don't know anything.
- Why did you walk in like that?
- What?
In the bar.
Why did you walk in like that?
What do you mean?
You knew that everyone would
look at you and I'd see it.
- You did it to fuck with me.
- Are you serious?
- What time is it?
- Six thirty. Go back to sleep.
- What are you doing up at this time?
- I'm going hunting with Paul.
Hunting? You?
- It'll be getting dark again soon!
- Coming.
- How are you getting on with that?
- It's heavy.
It's good to feel the weight.
Then you know it's there and
you use it when you need it.
- You sound like a proper hunter.
- I am a proper hunter.
My grandfather first took me
when I was nine.
If you stay alert today,
even you might bag something.
It's taking all my concentration
just to hold this bloody thing.
Oh! To hell with that.
If you come out with me, you shoot.
Hey, you see that path down there?
There's a game preserve.
It's isolated around here. Chances
are we won't see a soul all day.
Are you here or are you still in bed,
pressed up against your wife's ass?
I'm just thinking.
Then give it a rest. You think here,
and the prey gets away.
There you are!
You were asleep
and I wanted time to myself...
- I'll leave you to it.
- No, please, stay, stay.
I don't need to think any more.
- That was a bit of a scene yesterday.
- Don't worry about it.
No thanks, I have
a terrible headache.
That's from thinking so much.
Men!
Really, it's so easy
to make them happy.
Well, I've forgotten how to do it.
Or maybe I don't want to anymore.
Is it that bad?
How do you know if it's only
something temporary
or if everything's
shot to hell for good?
I think you never know...
until it happens.
I think it's happening.
I'm telling you,
they're happy. They don't go
over things so much.
That doesn't help
my headache so much.
Since I met Paul,
not a single night
has gone by without thinking
it might be
the last one together.
Or the first of the rest
of our life.
And here we are,
three years later.
Do you really want to get rid
of that headache?
Come on. Follow me.
- What are you doing?
- We're going to have a swim.
The water must be freezing.
What does it take to get you to
stop worrying about everything?
- And what if someone sees us?
- We're alone.
And if anyone does turn up,
we'll brighten his day.
We're gonna take a break.
Lester, you bastard, come here.
Did you know as soon
as you shoot a boar
you have to cut its balls off?
Otherwise, the meat tastes bad.
Lester!
Before you aim,
you have to take a deep breath,
enough to last until you fire.
Right now
there is just him
and me.
Nothing else exists.
There are hunters
and preys, Norman.
That's the only fucking truth
in this world.
Where are they?
I can't find my knickers.
- Are you sure you were wearing them?
- I was wearing them.
We'll probably see a squirrel
running about in them in a minute.
I thought shortcuts were supposed
to make the journey shorter.
The way back is always harder.
- We're almost there.
- Define almost.
What's that?
It looks like a house.
I'll take a look.
Maybe they can tell us
where the hell we are.
It looks like it's abandoned.
Let's have a nose inside.
Let's just go, we're already
lost, I'm knackered...
We're not fucking lost!
The river's behind those trees.
All we've gotta do is follow it.
I'm staying here.
That's typical of you, always
on the outside looking in.
Norman!
- What?
- Get over here!
What is it?
There's something in here.
Yeah, probably a trapped animal.
Animals doesn't lock
themselves in, does them?
- Can we get out of here? It stinks.
- Come here!
Listen,
do you hear that?
It sounds like music.
There's someone in here.
Hello.
Keep an eye on that dog.
Fuck!
Jesus Christ!
Norman, get over here!
Oh my God!
Do you see this?
Do you see the dog bowl
with the food?
Calm down.
Calm down.
We're not going to hurt you.
Norman, get the doll!
- Are you all right?
- I'm bleeding.
The dolly.
Your doll!
Give me the coat, Norman.
The coat!
We should get her home.
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- We can't leave her here!
Let's just put her back in there
and go and get help.
We can't just
put her back in there!
- We can't just leave her here!
- I don't mean that!
Then, what do you mean?
- I'm just trying to think.
- Let me think for both of us.
We'll get her out of here
and then get help. Ok?
Yeah...
Wrap the gear.
I'm bitten all over.
It's getting dark. We should
go out and look for them.
Where? There's no point
in us getting lost too.
When he comes back
I'm going to kill him.
Here they are!
Panic over, they always come back.
Idiot.
Don't say anything.
What's going on?
- We found her in the forest.
- Look at her!
Poor little thing.
She was in an abandoned house.
What?
We think she's been there
for a long time.
My God!
Hello.
Her parents
must be looking for her.
The important thing is that
she isn't locked up anymore.
We have to get her to the police.
Don't worry, love.
You'll be all right.
We're not going to hurt you.
Poor thing,
we should clean her up.
Lucy, run the bath.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Here.
OK, I'll take it off later.
Lucy, hold her for a minute,
we'll take the night dress off
once she is in the water.
Come on, for God's sake,
she's just a child!
- Norman, take her, I don't feel well.
- Are you ok?
Take it easy!
That's it! That's it!
She's scared to death.
Don't worry,
you're all right.
It's just water.
You see? It's just water.
It's not that terrible.
I've got a doll
dressed in blue...
The ones who were keeping her
are gonna realize she's gone.
Fucking animals.
Someone in the village must know
who she is. We should ask them!
I bet whoever locked her up
is from the village.
This is a matter for the police.
I think Paul's right.
We need to get her and move on.
Get her as quick as you can, yeah?
I'll wait for you in the car.
I've got a doll
dressed in blue
with her dress
and her apron too....
You don't have to go so fast.
It's very dark here.
You're going to have some story
to tell when you get back to London.
I mean it, slow down.
- Who'd do something like this?
- It's pretty clear why they did it.
Does that make it alright?
No, of course not, but it explains
why. Some people would be ashamed...
Do you think that's normal?
I was just pointing out
what the reason probably is.
We all think the same, don't we?
What if it were your daughter?
Why are you asking me that?
Are you bloody stupid?
Oh, please!
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm fine. What's wrong with you?
If I'd known you were going to be like
this I'd have left you at the house.
Watch out!
Are you all right?
- Is she ok?
- I think she's fine.
- I don't think anyone is hurt.
- What happened?
- Atree in the middle of the road.
- Shit.
Bollocks!
Oh, fuck me!
The axle is fucked.
It can't fix it.
Are you all right?
I hit my head, but it's nothing,
don't worry.
If we'd been in your car,
we'd have been killed.
Now what are we going to do?
I reckon we're about half an hour
from the house.
Are we going back?
- It's a long way.
- What do you want to do?
The sooner we start,
the sooner we'll get there.
Let me take her.
No, no. She's calm,
I'll keep hold of her.
Everyone stay together.
Mind where you walk.
What's wrong with her?
I think it's the moon.
Maybe she's never seen it before.
The dog woke me.
He seems uneasy.
Are you all right, Norman?
- Well, I'm a bit worried about.
- I didn't mean that.
I mean you and Lucy.
I think that's pretty obvious,
isn't it?
What is it, the baby?
She just can't get over it!
Can't or won't?
I don't know, she never
talked to me about it.
You should consider
trying for another.
I wished it was that easy.
What is it?
What is it?
What can you hear?
Lester!
¡Lester! ¡Lester!
Lester!
Lester!
Where is it?
Let's go back inside.
What about the dog?
He'll come back.
Good morning.
- There's coffee there if you want it.
- Where are you going?
If I take the girl, I would be at the
police station in a couple of hours.
- Oh, let me come with you.
- No. No.
I'm faster on my own.
You're more use to me
here with the women.
Who is it?
- Hello.
- Good morning.
Excuse me.
We're from the bar.
Yes, I remember.
What did you want?
Sorry, I'm Paco.
These are my brothers,
Lechón, and the kid, Antonio.
And our cousin Miguel.
A child from the village
has disappeared.
- We think she got lost.
- A little girl?
We've been looking for her
since dawn.
We thought
you might have seen her.
No, we haven't.
We were hoping you had.
I'm sorry.
We haven't seen anyone around here.
- You're the first ones.
- Yes.
It's a very isolated place.
No one comes here now.
What about your friends?
They're still asleep.
It's very early.
We don't want anything
to happen to her.
I'll help you look for her.
No, don't worry.
We can do it ourselves.
- We don't want to bother you.
- It's no bother.
Just a minute.
- What are you doing?
- They are from the bar, aren't they?
Go upstairs and check
on the kid and keep her quiet.
- Are they looking for her?
- What are we going to do?
- Maybe we should give her to them?
- We can't do that.
Go upstairs!
Lucy please, just go upstairs.
It's that bastard from the bar,
isn't it.
They musn't find out
that she's here.
I'm gonna go with them. It's the only
way to make sure that they leave.
Paul, they know she is here.
Calm down and listen.
I'll go with them towards the north.
You take the kid and go down
to the main road. You'll be
in the police station in 2 hours.
- Two hours!
- Leave Isabel and Lucy here.
You'll be faster on your own.
I'll come back for them.
I don't feel like leaving
them here on their own.
They can lock everything up.
We'll meet up with you
at the police station.
This is insane.
Hey, I can handle these people.
Won't be long.
Tell the girls to get ready.
Know what?
My dog has disappeared too.
City dogs go crazy in the woods.
They get disoriented.
Don't worry.
As soon as the mist clears
he'll turn up.
Yeah, he's very smart.
Just like this one.
Right, you old bastard?
You know,
you speak pretty good Spanish.
Almost better than this lot.
I'm learning.
That's what I tell them to do.
Well,
it's best if we split up.
Miguel, go with Lechón and Antonio.
I'll go with him.
- Why does he have to come with us?
- Because I say so.
Go down by the river.
Don't worry,
you'll be safe with me.
I'm not worried.
What's the girl's name?
Nerea.
She's called Nerea.
Like her mother.
She's our sister.
Leave her mother out of it.
Come on, we haven't got all day.
Paul will be back soon.
I think I owe you an explanation.
- I'm sorry about all this.
- About what?
Being so stupid recently,
I swear I'm not doing it on purpose.
Don't worry.
If there's anything you want
to talk to me about, you can.
Just ignore me,
I'm feeling just a bit moody.
That's all.
Good morning.
Where's Paul?
He's gone to get help.
Why didn't anyone wake me up?
Has he gone on his own?
- You know him. He wouldn't wait.
- Without saying anything to me?
I think that's very odd. Paul
wouldn't go off without telling me.
Don't worry, he'll be back soon.
I hope he's taken Lester with him,
because that guy's
capable of getting lost.
The dog is with him,
everything is fine.
I'm going to take a bath.
What if he doesn't come back?
Why wouldn't he come back?
When he does he can explain it to
her. I don't know what's going on.
Why can't we take the child
and go and look for the police?
This might be the time to do it.
Let's just wait for Paul.
That's what he asked me to do.
So we have to do
what the boss orders.
Ok, What do you want to do?
We're in the middle of nowhere!
We're going to wait for him
and that's all there is to it.
We should never have come here.
Ok, go upstairs and get the girl
and we'll go.
No, come on, you lead the way.
We're not solving anything
by shutting ourselves in here.
And if we go running
through the forest, we will?
Oh, Jesus!
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Norman?
I'm going outside
to see if I can see Paul.
I'm not solving anything in here.
Want one?
Thank you.
It's the only brand we smoke here.
Nice shotgun.
Do you hunt a lot?
I did when I was young.
I took it up again recently.
It's like riding a bike,
you don't forget.
Are you a good shot?
I'm better now than I was then.
See that branch sticking out?
Yeah.
Good.
Give it up, I tried before
and you can't get anything decent.
And please, don't play
the Leonard Cohen tape again.
I'm worried about the child.
I feel so sorry for her.
Maybe I'll go up and see how she is.
Awhile ago
she was curled up in a corner.
I'm going to see how she is.
I'll go this way!
We'll meet on that hill!
Be careful.
What?
You'll get lost.
We'll end up looking for you too.
We should stick together.
It could be dangerous.
Norman?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- We're sorry to come in like this.
We've been walking all morning
and we thought
you might give us
something to drink.
Yes, of course.
Please, sit down.
That's very kind.
Take off your coats.
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.
You, what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
There's a big storm on the way.
Even the birds aren't moving.
Would you like some coffee?
We've just made some.
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.
They know we've got the girl.
- We're gonna have to give her to them.
- So that they can tie her up again?
Bring them coffee, so they can leave.
I hope you're right.
Milk, sugar?
No, thank you.
We like it strong.
No sugar.
This is great.
You can't beat a woman's touch.
Where's the other one?
The other one?
Yeah, the one who looks
like a dummy.
He's due any minute.
Sure.
It's starting to rot.
What?
The rabbit.
It's starting to rot.
Don't you smell it?
Tell them to leave.
- What did she say?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
Please, leave.
We've got a lot to do.
Why don't we dance?
I haven't danced
with a pretty woman in ages.
Only the ugly ones will dance
with me.
Find a romantic song.
It isn't working properly.
That one'll do!
Please, leave.
Just one dance,
then we'll leave. I promise.
Tell her to be nice to me.
It's just a dance.
That's it, like that.
Turn it up.
Paul?
Go on, dance with the other one!
Go on!
I don't want to.
Don't be rude.
She wants to.
Isn't that right?
He's handsome, isn't he?
The girls fight over him.
But the idiot isn't interested.
I think he's a nancy.
Stop pretending.
I saw how you looked at me
in the bar.
Please let go of me.
I like your voice,
but I like your mouth more.
Take it easy!
The child is upstairs.
Please, don't hurt us.
Well, the hen finally squawked.
Antonio, go up and get her.
- We shouldn't...
- Go and get her!
And you,
if you want your friend
to keep all her teeth,
sit there and shut up.
You've got what you wanted!
- Now, go away...
- That's enough!
No more games.
Stand still, I'll move you.
Go outside and keep watch.
We've got the girl.
I said, go outside!
Or do you want me to thump you?
Tell her I'll take the knife away
but she'd better not try anything.
Tell her!
He's going to take the knife away.
Please, let him finish
and they'll go away.
Good! I see you've understood.
What about the police?
- We should tell them.
- The police?
They don't care.
They laugh at our problems.
We sort things out ourselves.
The child's mother must be worried.
Leave her alone.
She's a good woman,
it's not her fault.
I didn't mean any offense.
I should go back.
Go back?
Go back to my friends.
You should go to the police.
This is serious.
Yes, it's no joke.
This is a peaceful place.
We're humble and hardworking.
Perhaps we're not
as educated as you
but we're honorable
and we don't like problems.
And if you don't like a problem
you lock it up like an animal.
There are things
that shouldn't be known.
If I offended God,
I have to pay for it.
Who has that child offended?
Some times, the innocent
pay for the sinners.
Look,
she's a good girl.
I wouldn't like anything bad
to happen to her.
Why did you leave the house empty?
The house isn't empty.
I know it isn't.
What have you done, idiot?
If he doesn't understand words...
What the hell!
And I was bored.
There's no point in asking you
what to do, is there?
Just let me think.
We have no time.
A fucking dead body.
Hiding it won't fix anything.
We can't stay here.
The others will be here soon.
Where are we gonna go?
We are gonna find the police.
- What are we gonna tell them?
- The truth.
- What's the truth?
- That bastard tried to rape me!
And I shot him! I killed him!
That's what happened.
- It was self defence!
- Was it?
Lucy, what have I done?
- Let's just think about all this, ok?
- Think about what?
We'll wait for Paul,
he'll know what to do.
We're not in England.
Things are different here.
What are you talking about?
They had a little girl locked up
and they attacked us.
Is that legal around here?
Can we prove how he died?
They could say anything.
You're just panicking,
now relax for God's sake.
I need to get it clear
in my head what happened.
- We have to move.
- Where the hell is Paul?
I want an answer!
He's with the people from the village.
He's helping them look for the child.
What?
But she's here,
he knows she's here.
He's pretending to look.
It was his idea.
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Fine?
- With them?
- Paul can look after himself.
We have to get out of here.
- Keep the child and we'll go.
- I'm not leaving without Paul.
It's not safe to stay here.
And letting him go off alone with
those people was completely safe?
Can we get to our car?
Yeah, yeah, let's go.
- I didn't hit him that hard.
- Shut up.
You nearly beat his head in.
Give me that.
Wake up!
Can you hear me?
We're leaving you here.
We'll get the girl
and then come back.
Understand?
When things calm down,
you and I have to talk.
Come on, lift him up.
Get him walking.
Let's see if this fixes him.
We'll lock you in here.
It's for your own good.
You'd never get out of the woods.
We'll be back in a few hours.
You can think what's best for you.
I can walk.
- I'm all right.
- Leave him be. He can go on his own.
- Don't kill him!
- Bastard!
There he is!
Fuck it!
I told you not to shoot!
I didn't hit him.
Give me the dog.
I can't go any further.
Where the hell is the car?
This is the right way.
I'm sure.
Everything looks the same to me.
And this bloody rain...
I'm doing the best I can, and
if you argue I can't concentrate.
Attack! Attack!
He's here!
Son of a bitch!
She is going to catch pneumonia.
Take this.
Giver her to me, I'll take her.
Leave her be! Can't you see
she doesn't want to go with you?
We have to keep going.
Don't move or I blow
your fucking had off.
Where are the others?
Where are they?
You all right?
And Lechón?
He's dead.
Dead?
In the house.
Where's Miguel?
Did you hear that?
It sounded like a shot.
What if it's Paul?
What if he's trying to find us?
Come on, we have to find out.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
But we have to find help.
- Any ideas?
- Venancios.
- What does that mean?
- There.
- The village where we stopped?
- No. This is a different one.
We need help, Norman.
I don't know...
They may have a telephone.
Give me the girl.
Hello, we're sorry to bother you.
We've got a problem,
our car is out of gas.
- Can we use your phone?
- I'm sorry, we don't have one.
There are none in the village.
Can I do anything?
There are no phones
in the whole village.
Great!
What do we do now?
We've gotta go and get a phone,
it'll be dark in a few hours.
Come inside, you're soaked.
Why don't we stay here?
She's asked us to stay.
- I don't trust her.
- Ayoung girl? Come on, Norman.
We're exhausted and she's soaked.
We need a rest.
Come in, or you'll catch pneumonia.
She insists.
- I don't care.
- I do.
Thank you.
The child must be frozen.
Yes, she's very tired.
Child fine, thank you.
Come inside.
What's up?
- They're English, they ran out of gas.
- Good evening.
'Evening.
This is a bad place to run out
of gas, and in this rain.
Yes.
Go on, go and fix
something hot for them.
Thank you.
Could you please tell him
to leave his gun over there?
It's the devil's weapon.
You'd better
leave the shotgun over there.
Thank you.
My daughter is preparing
something hot to warm you up.
- You're very kind.
- Don't mention it.
There are towels upstairs,
and clothes you can put on
- while yours are drying.
- That's great.
I could give you some gas
and drive you to the car,
but the tracks are so muddy
it's not a good idea.
- Perhaps he could take us to the...
- We have to get out of this place.
You can leave if you want
but I won't.
We can't go on walking through
the forest all night long.
What are you thinking of?
We have to get out of here!
I think you should calm down.
Thank him for everything but
we are leaving as soon as we can.
There are two empty rooms upstairs
if you want to change.
- Yes.
- It's this way.
Come on, let's go.
Actually, this isn't so awful.
What? Do you mean the house?
I don't know, everything.
Paul was right,
this place is lovely.
Yes, it is lovely.
Lucy...
Yes?
- Do you love me?
- What?
Answer me, please.
We should get some rest.
Maybe afterwards we'll be able
to see it clearly.
When I saw that man
on top of you and I fired...
I felt as if I was doing it
more for me than for you.
But, you know what?
After I killed him
I didn't feel any relief.
And I still don't.
Why don't you take some rest?
I can't.
Lucy, wake up! I knew
we should have kept going!
Get the girl!
- You're scaring me, Norman!
- Just do it!
Why are there only two of them?
Where are the others?
- We're leaving!
- What's wrong?
Hurry!
Let's go.
No. Tell us what is going on.
Two of those bastards are outside.
We have to get out of here.
Come on!
Where's Paul? Is he with them?
Are you coming or not?
Sir, what's going on?
- Where is the back door?
- What?
I don't understand.
Are you all right?
Take a look upstairs!
Please...
Where is Paul?
Calm down.
Paul!
Fucking bastard!
Now we're going to cross
the square. Without a sound.
Don't worry, we'll get the car
and get out of here.
Give me the child.
Please, give her to me.
She's my daughter.
Look, she's crying.
Don't make me kill you!
Norman, don't do it.
That's it, Norman.
Put the gun down, please.
It's over.
For God's sake, Norman.
Stop all this now!
What's wrong with you?
Please, I'm begging you!
Haven't enough people
died already?
It's all over, Norman.
Don't you understand?
It's all over!
Of course I understand.
You'll have to come with me
to the police.
Come on, get in the car.
Get in the car.
Do you understand?
You understand, don't you?
Everything all right, Lucy?
