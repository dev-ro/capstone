HONOR AMONG THIEVES
Look at this, Max.
Still no news of the gold bars
stolen last month at Orly
Come along. You'll enjoy it.
lsn't that so, Riton?
It's a first class show.
It's really quite good, Max.
You tell him, Riton!
You must come, Max.
Lola in the 2nd number
will be a riot.
Oh yes, I know...
Where are you going?
I'm going to play my tune.
You wanted to eat it.
And it's magnificent.
They're charming.
Do we get any service?
- We want to eat.
- Sorry, no more room.
- And those tables...
- Reserved.
We'll have a drink
while we are waiting.
Better go across the road.
They do you well.
Just over there, see?
You'll be well looked after.
Fools are two a penny this year.
You've got the right idea, kid.
If I served everybody, there'd be
no room for you. Now we're quiet.
The ladies were dying
for a piece of moka.
I was closing.
You were nearly turned out.
- You've eaten?
- No, I'm not hungry.
Hello, kid.
Sit down.
Give him a fork, Bouche.
Have this piece of cake.
We leave enough money here.
What'll you drink?
Give him a coffee.
Well, Max, are you coming to clap?
If you don't like it,
you can always go away...
You don't have to stay.
Well, I'll come along with you, anyhow...
I'll bring Marco.
That'll be company for you.
Seeing the girls
will buck you up a bit.
What's the matter?
Owe money here?
Yes, 9,000.
Don't worry, I'll see to it.
No reason why you should.
Put that to Marco's account.
Thanks.
Make out my bill.
Had enough?
We'll be late.
Already are.
I'll open the door for you.
A good meal, Madam Bouche.
Glad you liked it.
For once I've made you a compliment...
You've 11,000 credit here.
I can't thank you enough.
Get in next to him.
Sweet violets, Miss?
- Only one hundred.
- No, thank you.
Wait for me afterwards?
What an idea!
You'll still be dancing
when I'm snoring.
Snore if you like... at my place...
Stay with us, Max.
We'll have no fun without you.
After midnight
I feel like I'm working overtime.
Well, come along...
Lola is happy.
I told you not to...
- Don't leave it miles away.
- No, Mr Riton.
Next time you're late,
I'll fine you both.
We'll be ready.
Get dressed and shut up.
It's not their fault.
We are so handsome...
they couldn't get away from us.
We had to bring them.
Do I thank you for ruining my show?
Well, I'll put you
where you can see it.
What do you say? My best table.
- I should hope so.
- Quite so.
Excuse me. I'm busy.
Send us some champagne... dry...
Choose the brand yourself...
Let's have a magnum.
Yes, a magnum.
You're a hit, aren't you?
It's Vera. I must see to her.
You won't waste your time
with those girls.
Well, here we go...
Angelo wants to see you
in Pierrot's office.
Shall I help you to carry all that?
You're naughty, Mr Max.
Where are you off to?
To see Pierrot.
Sorry to trouble you, Max.
Not at all.
Leave us alone, Ramon. Take the car...
I'll tell you what it's about, Max.
We wanted you
to settle a question between us...
Carry on with it.
You know I supply the stuff here.
And nobody complains, eh?
Fresh goods and correct weight...
What about the keys?
What d'you think of Ramon?
I know nothing of Ramon.
I don't give a damn for him...
but I know
the big chief doesn't like him.
Anyhow, I think that could be arranged.
Question of personalities.
I don't know, Max.
I don't think you know Ramon...
No. Anyhow your business is specialized.
You need a fellow
who looks well and is at his ease...
I've a fine place...
It cost me a lot of dough.
I don't want it closed
on account of Ramon.
Ramon's a slacker.
Keep him as a chauffeur...
all he's good for.
I think I have the man you need.
Anyhow, I'll vouch for him.
If he's interested, I'll send him here.
Max is a good pal.
Want one?
Yes, and if he likes someone,
he'll do anything...
Riton, for example...
They say it's gone on for 20 years.
20 years they've been together.
That's friendship, eh?
And I'm friendly with him.
Got something for you.
Not doing anything?
Angelo wants somebody
to push his stuff.
He's plenty of people.
Yes, but Pierrot doesn't like them.
So I thought of you.
They're waiting for you in the office.
I've vouched for you,
so don't play the fool.
Don't make a face!
Listen, I'm off. Staying?
One last drink?
I've heard about your last drinks.
After that we'll have
to have one with Pierrot.
And then there'll be the girls.
They'll want us to take them to supper...
and then stuff 'em.
So what?
Well, I don't want to. I'm tired.
No, I'm off.
I'll go and tell Lola I'm off.
She might make the hit of her life
this evening.
I mustn't ruin her career.
I want to thank you, Max. It worked.
That's OK.
Well, come in...
No harm done.
I was just congratulating Josy.
You've every reason to.
She's magnificent.
She's funny, eh?
Well, I'm off. Thanks for Marco.
Don't be silly.
Max, I must speak to you.
I'm through with Riton.
It's been a long time.
Why tell this to me?
Because you've just seen me
with Angelo...
and only you can make Riton understand.
Tell him. I don't dare.
Angelo's right. You're funny.
He'll listen if you talk to him.
Don't be angry with me.
I want you to help me,
I'm so afraid...
If you see Lola... No, there she is.
I had to stay
to have my neckline lowered...
to show more breast.
Don't let me down. Only you can help.
Listen, I'm leaving. I'm tired.
You won't wait?
What a fellow he is!
That's the 3rd time
the electrician has pinched my bottom.
- He does it to me too.
- What, to you too?
- Staying?
- No, I'm going, and you too.
Haven't you finished
playing the fool at your age?
You're just like those saps.
Look at 'em.
Mr Dugenet... with his nerves.
Duglandin with his engravings.
And Dufion, the whipping block.
All paying for dances
and waiting for the show girls.
And you're just like them.
Waiting patiently
for Madam to get dressed.
You're a real sap, chum...
A sap? Why am I a sap?
Because 10 years ago
you'd have waited for her
to come home
with the money, understand?
Now you don't even let her make any.
I don't care
whether she makes money now.
Then all the more reason...
You know what happens
when you give in to them.
So go off home alone.
Your Josy knows the way back.
Anyhow...
a little anxiety
will lick her into shape...
You're right. I'll go.
Nothing to pay. Orders from the boss.
Take you home?
Nonsense! I'll take a taxi.
Till tomorrow,
one o'clock at Bouche's.
Odd! An ambulance has been tailing us.
It's gone past the hospital.
And it's still there.
Step on the gas a bit, just to see.
OK, that's enough.
That's your street. We'll see.
Good, slow down.
3rd house on the right...
Now drive on fast.
Well, Ramon...
This a new game? Ambulance rally?
We weren't coming to you.
No? Going to the midwife's, perhaps?
I'll help you by waking her up.
You're mad, Max. Stop.
A brandy. Can I telephone?
Go right ahead.
Give me Mr Henri, please.
Mr Henri who?
Ducros... Ducros.
I call him Mr Riton.
Split the difference.
You won't regret it, I promise you.
Riton? Listen to me.
Is someone there?
I'm with Angelo and Bastien
discussing business.
Now listen, Riton.
Don't leave your room with them
under any pretext.
Fishy business, understand?
Get 'em out immediately.
When they've gone, come and talk.
Sorry, guys, but I can't come with you.
Family troubles. I can't get out of it.
That's a nuisance, Riton.
I was counting on you...
They're counting on me too,
and for far longer.
If I'd known, I'd not have asked.
You'll find somebody else.
Sorry about it...
On the contrary, it's I who am sorry.
Well, so long, fellows.
We'll do anotherjob.
Have they gone?
Wait a minute.
They've driven off. What's happening?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Take your car and meet me
in front of 40, rue des DÃ©troits.
Yes, 40. Twice 20.
Near the Porte des Ternes.
See you're not followed.
OK.
Wish we had more like him...
- Not followed?
- No, I watched out.
Move over. I'll drive.
Where are we?
I've an apartment here.
We'll put your car in the garage.
What's this nonsense with Angelo?
I'll tell you when we're at my place.
I think I ought to show you something.
Whose is that?
Mine.
Must be worth a packet.
And more. It's a special...
What's it worth?
About 51 grand.
Here, look at this.
Our loot is all packed
in cartridge cases.
Two ingots in each.
That makes 50 pounds.
Makes it easier to carry.
And you actually carry
our 50 grand around?
Don't be silly. I took that car
direct from the factory...
the night before we did the job.
The next day I filled it.
It's been here ever since.
See how I organize things?
Why d'you say that?
I don't understand.
I'll tell you upstairs.
Solid fastenings!
What about housebreakers?
You never told me about this place.
Just a little investment.
I don't come here often.
Sit down. I'll be right back.
I almost like this
better than your other apartment.
Yes, it's quieter.
It was pretty quiet in the other one.
Yes, but it isn't anymore.
Have a go at that.
A friend sent it to me from Nantes.
There's no bread, so have a biscuit, eh?
You remember the other evening...
I left you to go and talk to Lola?
Know who was in her dressing room?
Josy... with Mr Angelo,
going hard at it, believe me.
Why didn't you say?
I'm thinking about serious business
rather than petting parties.
I keep them separate.
I hope you understand me...
Now tell me why you talked to Josy.
What can I say?
I wanted to keep her quiet.
She told me I was getting nowhere
and would never have ajoint like Pierrot.
So I told her not to worry.
I had the necessary.
You're right. I'm a sap.
Let's say temporary madness.
But what's Angelo's game in all this?
What does he want?
Have you any ideas?
Any idea why he wanted you
to do that job with him?
Think of it, for once.
I can't see...
Well, I'll explain.
He wanted to take you to a quiet spot
and work you over...
till you spilt the beans.
And to make sure,
he wanted to get me too.
I'll deal with Angelo.
Listen, sucker,
you are going to drop them...
That's my business, it seems.
You're gonna leave me in peace.
That job was my last.
It was done and that was that.
I'd been waiting for it.
I've been fed up
with our whole business for a long time.
I want to retire, you understand.
I know, Max...
Just look at your mug a bit.
Look at the bags under your eyes...
and that, and that.
Think it's pretty, eh?
No, chum, get a hold of yourself.
You exaggerate.
No, I'm not exaggerating at all.
Poor old Riton.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Tomorrow, we'll change all that
into good banknotes.
I'd like to have waited a bit,
but you've been so clever...
What about Angelo?
We'll leave him Josy.
That'll do you good.
Not eating?
Right then, we'll hit the hay...
Here's pyjamas...
and a towel.
If you want to clean your teeth,
you'll find some toothpaste...
Take your own bed, I'll sleep there.
As you like. I don't care.
What would you do about Josy?
How should I know?
I'm not in your shoes.
Your uncle's busy.
Come and wait in my office.
Say, that's heavy.
As pretty as ever.
Be good, Max.
He's your uncle, after all.
That's fine! Keep it in the family.
It's nice to find
one's little friends in good form.
Yes, but we haven't seen you
for three months.
Too busy, my little darling.
Count on me...
Thanks, old man.
Morning, uncle.
Come in. I'm in a hurry.
Take the other two.
I'm not to be disturbed. I'm out.
In what form?
In ingots.
No certificate of origin?
Perhaps you'd like an invoice.
How much have you?
96 kilograms.
How heavy this stuff can be...
Money's money!
Is that all you have to sell?
Reward... Stolen at Orly in September
8 gold ingots - 96 kilograms.
If you think business is easy...
I'm not really interested.
It's your living, isn't it?
Tell me how much you're paying.
35 grand.
You've missed the mark.
They're worth 50.
Quite so, with a certificate of origin...
but I'll have to melt them down
and make little ones.
All that costs money.
If my price doesn't interest you...
take them away.
This isn't a warehouse.
You're getting greedy.
What about all the bloodsuckers
I have to pay to keep quiet?
So that they don't have time
to get too inquisitive.
Will you grease their palms for me?
Yes, give us a little drink.
You're all the same.
You think a receiver is dishonest.
All right, pay up then.
What? 35 grand just like that?
You think I have it here?
Anyhow, I'll have to get rid of 'em
one at a time.
It'll take at least 10 days.
Gold coins would have been quicker.
Good health.
- Not drinking?
- Never in the morning.
I'd like it in 10,000 bills...
divided into two equal packets...
and the right amount.
I am your uncle.
That's lucky.
So long, kid.
As soon as it's fixed,
call me at 5590...
my new home.
Everything will be all right.
Hold on...
One second...
Drop it.
At last! Give me Miss Josy... No. 16.
She's left.
Seen Mr Riton?
- Who's asking?
- Mr Max...
Ah, good evening, Sir.
Mr Riton's just left in an ambulance.
You saw the ambulance?
What color was it?
I didn't notice.
What do you think happened?
I don't really know.
Better ask Miss Josy...
when she comes back. Is that all?
Yes, that's all.
That Riton is a headache...
has been for a long time.
Always doing something idiotic.
What a fool he is!
And he thinks he's somebody
because he's brave.
He may be brave, but he's a fool.
I ought never
to have hitched up with him.
The things I might have done,
if I had not always had him.
Well, that's my fault.
I ought to have worked alone.
Trouble is, I've been sentimental.
Well, that's just too bad for me.
But what a fool I was
to tie myself up with him.
Not to mention the money
he's cost me in 20 years...
paying his lawyers,
paying for his mother...
There isn't a tooth in his mouth
I've not paid for.
Well, now he can look after himself.
Are you free for lunch?
Always, for you.
I'd like you to come to my place.
What d'you think?
I'll change, and be with you
in half an hour.
Poor old Riton. I really am a bastard.
You love me, Max?
Coming.
You're an odd person...
After all, I don't even know you are.
Annoys you, doesn't it?
Well, I'm off.
Till tomorrow?
Yes.
Good evening, Mr Max.
Like to work with me? I need someone...
It won't be a picnic...
but it'll be worthwhile.
I warn you, it'll be tough. Well?
OK. Riton's not with you?
No. That's why.
I'll explain on the way.
That's fine.
Hang on a second and we'll go.
Hello, Max. There's fish soup,
roast chicken and...
Just take a look at this.
Unfortunately, I'm not eating.
Go next door.
I'm on ajob which may turn out bad.
So I'm going to give you 200, so that....
in case of trouble,
there'll be something for the lawyers.
You're one of the best.
Coming, kid?
Is that Bouche's?
- Is Max there?
- Who wants him?
Angelo, Madam Bouche.
How unfortunate! He's just gone.
Is he coming back?
I can't tell you. I don't know.
There you are! Open up!
It's occupied.
There's someone there now.
Open up! It's me... Max.
I can't open now.
I tell you it's Max.
What did I tell you?
- I want to talk to you.
- I've work to do.
Not pleased, eh?
Tell me what happened.
Come on, spill the beans!
I'll explain, Max...
- Were you there?
- No.
So scram. I'm speaking to Josy.
Riton came here.
As he came in, they jumped him.
Who did?
First, Jojo...
Where was Jojo?
There, behind the door.
I'll show you.
He had a cosh.
Ah, so he was in the room?
As you'd seen us together...
Angelo sent him
to protect me against Riton.
And who were the others?
There was Angelo with Ramon next door.
But I didn't know that...
until they answered the telephone...
and I recognized Angelo's voice,
just before Riton came.
It's not true...
I'm only beginning...
I advise you to tell all.
I told them their friend was coming.
Shouldn't I have?
No, you shouldn't.
Where did they go?
I don't know, Max.
If I did, I'd tell you.
What about Angelo's place?
Where did you shack up with him?
In a hotel.
You know too much
about some people...
and not enough about others.
And what do you know?
I swear to you,
I don't know any addresses.
How much did they give you
to keep quiet?
50,000.
Let's have it!
I've no time to deal with you, but...
What am I to do, Max?
They wanted to take me too,
but I ran away.
Why did you come back?
To get my things.
But I don't know where to go.
Lola can't help me...
You poor little lost girl!
Don't move!
What a small world!
Move over.
And how's Angelo?
I don't know.
We'll find out.
Is Pierrot there?
Hello, big chief! I need your help.
- What's happened?
- But I don't want to cause trouble...
Don't worry. Tell me.
Well, Angelo and his gang
are giving me trouble.
It started last night...
and this morning they kidnapped Riton.
I want to know where they took him.
Come with me.
No, we'll be better off in the cellar.
- What are you going to do?
- You'll find out, little girl...
We're under the Metro.
Nobody will hear your screams.
Now tell us.
Tell what? I've done nothing.
I suppose you were spying
on me for fun. Now talk...
It was Angelo...
He was after your loot.
What loot?
Well, tell him.
He said you've done a 50 grand job.
It was you?
Well, carry on.
He said if we got you or Riton,
you'd say where it was.
Where's Riton?
I don't know, Plerrot, I swear.
We're wasting time.
Take off his jacket.
Listen, Fifi,
we're going to give you the works.
Tell us where Riton is.
It'll save time.
If you don't tell us, you'll be sorry.
Congratulations.
What are you doing here?
There's a call for Max.
Who from?
Angelo. He'll call back.
I don't understand.
How can he know I'm here?
- I can tell you.
- Speak up!
Untie me first.
Stay with him.
Angelo?
That you, Max?
Angelo here. Can you hear me?
Listen. There's no time to lose...
if you want Riton alive.
I'm listening.
I've nothing against Riton... or you.
I only want your loot...
and I want it within an hour.
I'll give you Riton
to show he's here.
Don't give in.
Put Angelo on again.
Don't give in, Max.
I want to speak to Angelo.
Well, you heard?
If you care about his health,
you must act quickly.
Understand, Max?
I'll do a fair exchange...
Riton for the loot...
Get out the guns and bring up Fifi.
Now listen. Put the loot in your car.
Things are moving.
We'll take him upstairs.
- Do some work.
- Glad to.
I do my business in the day-time.
At night I sleep.
But let me speak!
You can say what you like...
I hate being disturbed...
when I've just got off to sleep.
Listen, Oscar, I'm in a mess...
and I need my stuff immediately.
Get Eugene to bring down my cases.
Is he there?
I'll have to wake him up.
I'll come in 10 minutes.
Thanks a lot. Sorry to disturb you.
Help me with the popguns.
What do you want?
Come in and shut the door.
Thank you, Max.
I'm very sorry, but I'm in a fix.
I'll tell you all about it
when we come back.
We'll tell her if we like.
Take him with you.
I'll follow.
He won't be gone for long,
I promise you.
I can't start again at my age.
I've told you, I gave you my word...
What a dirty trick
to leave me alone out here.
Go and hunt for snails.
Let's have the packet.
D'you hear?
That's them.
There they are.
Can't you take this off now?
We'll take it off soon.
Get out, Riton.
Go on, reply.
Go to it, and watch out.
Oh, it's Marco.
- Yes, it's me.
- Well, hello.
Move over there.
Search them, Riton.
- Nothing.
- That'll do.
Well, get moving.
Put it down there.
Now, move that.
I hope you're not armed.
No, we aren't.
Nor are we.
Marco, come over here.
May I...?
OK.
Well, that's lucky.
Join us when we're in the car.
Till then, no one is to move.
Well, come with us.
I'm tired. I'd like to get to bed.
We're off. It'll be better
if you're prudent.
I tell you, they had two cars.
I was blindfolded...
but I heard the other car's engine.
Look.
Take cover!
Keep your heads down.
We can be seen.
Hurry up.
They didn't miss.
I'm not going to bed yet.
We can't get home with that.
Riton, get their car quickly.
Look after Marco.
It's not possible.
What are they doing?
There they are!
Get a move on!
The tires! Shoot at the tires!
Come and help me... The loot!
Well, let's go.
You shouldn't all stay in the room.
He must have rest.
What do you think, doctor?
He's tough, eh?
He's waking up.
Still there, Max?
Well, you chump...
Pierrot, tell him to get out.
Why, what's the rush?
Go out, Max. Show yourself.
Go to the restaurant...
What time is it?
6 in the morning.
Riton's right. You must go.
Right, I'll be off.
Come back after lunch.
So long.
Pitched battle on a country road.
The Orly gold
discovered in a blazing car.
That's all a reporter's invention.
But it's Angelo's photo.
What does the photo prove?
You could be run down
by a car tomorrow...
and your picture will be
in all the papers with some story.
What? Don't you believe in the Orly job?
He didn't say that.
He merely said it wasn't Angelo.
Angelo would never deal
in that sort of business.
Bouche, my cigarettes...
I haven't any more.
But it was Angelo who was in the car
with the loot, wasn't it?
How do you know it was him?
But they found his ring.
Oh, the ring...!
Look, ask him.
You're not bad-looking.
Of course, you don't know
my friend Betty.
I've often told you of Madam Bouche.
Sit down there.
Excuse me a second.
Haven't you seen the papers?
Yes, why?
You knew Angelo.
Tell him what you think.
We're arguing about it.
That's all very well, but I'm hungry.
How do you do it?
Do what?
Good old Max.
Choose what you like.
I'll have roast beef.
I must telephone first.
Give me Mr Pierrot.
Mr Max is on the 'phone.
Riton is dead, Max.
Coming?
I've just arrived at Bouche's.
If I left, it would look odd.
Yes, you're right.
Go on with your lunch.
You must be seen.
Yes... So long.
I hadn't noticed you wore glasses.
They're for reading.
It'll happen to you one day.
Shall I keep your money?
Yes, for the time being.
- Can we eat?
- Go and sit down.
I'm not angry, but you're a fool.
Well, tell your story.
- Why? You know it.
- No, I don't know it.
Well, it's too late.
And he says he's not angry.
Say, Max, BÃ©bert's angry about Angelo.
Just deal and shut up.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
How much?
- 3,000, eh?
- If you like.
