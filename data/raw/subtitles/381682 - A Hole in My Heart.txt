That's what we're stiII doing today
We are searching and searching
But no one can find anything
So man can't be whoIe again
Man can't be

Everyone is in confusion
Iooking for what can't be found
Everyone wanders around Iooking for
their other haIf, and they can't find it

It's the onIy reason
You twist everything,
so that everything I say is fine

Listen, I've got an idea

Since then, they've hung out together
It's about communicating

- That's how you do it
- It's great fun
- We think it's fun, why can't you?
- Come on, Eric
- Join in
- Christ!
You can't reject what you haven't tried
You don't know if it's fun
- It's fun!
- You reject cycIing before you try it?!
This was
This was when I was smaII
{y:i}l'll show you something
"We'll try" a"nd hit the bre"a"st"
I'II try and shoot off the nippIe
- Right in the middIe
- I don't want to shoot
Try it!
When I see this photo I think of
how it couId have been, how
it was and especiaIIy, how it became
Okay, Eric
Good
Shoot, for fuckssake!
I'm obviousIy not devoid of emotions,
but
they're aII bunched together
in a great big fucking
Did you think it was fun
That's good
As you think so -
- we shouId go to the gun shop
Get your very own, reaI gun
ReaI
- I don't know
- You don't know?
Let's go right now
No No
- Do you miss mom?
- What?
- Do you miss mom?
- PIease
Forget it We can forget mom
and we can forget the gun
I've anaIyzed you
What's that?
I've anaIyzed you
You've anaIyzed me?
You're a homosexuaI,
aIthough you don't know it yourseIf
What the heII do you mean?
Since mom died
none of your reIationships
have Iasted more than a month
And when you have sex with a woman,
it's aIways from behind
And anaI
so you don't have to see her face
So the woman is there just so you can
spit at and humiIiate her
Because you don't Iike women
That's the thing And so
This whoIe gang-bang thing
is aII about -
- you guys getting cIoser
to one another when you
stick your penises in the poor,
stupid girI's bodiIy openings
So you can rub your penises
against one another
What the fuck
do you know about that?
If one of you is in one hoIe
and the other is in the other hoIe
then you meet in the middIe
- There's just a Iayer of skin between you
- Is that so, you fuck?
You you haven't even
heId a girI's hand before
You know nothing about it Listen
Who pIayed with doIIs
when he was smaII?
Who wanted to have a dress
when he turned five? And why was that?
- I've anaIyzed that as weII
- Have you, professor?
And what did you concIude?
It was because I missed mom
I pretended the doIIs were mom
I Iove you
I Iove you
I Iove you I do I Iove you
You know what Iinks those that do
the sickest, most disgusting things?
AII of those who torture,
rape and start wars?
AII of them,
every singIe one, is a man
Do you understand
why I don't want to be one?
Forget it, forget it
Just move on, smiIe and wink
- Shut up!
- It's tricky
- You can shut up now!
- The sIightest mistake and it's over
- You're training aII wrong
- And you're so good at it
- Shit!

I pIayed in a hard rock band
Heavy metaI
Shit, it was it was Ioud
We're taIking about '83 or '84
We made a record It wasn't
exactIy number one that year
But for some inexpIicabIe reason
Sometimes in Iife
you have to be Iucky
WhiIe we met rejection here,
these guys turned up
WeII, there was an American IabeI
that heard us
and became interested in us
And brought us, Iike, the boys, over
We went over there
My mom comes from the USA She
comes from Sacramento in CaIifornia
We were a support band
for Hanoi Rocks and
She'd received a grant
so she couId be trained as a nurse
and MötIey Crüe
At roughIy that time,
Reagan became president
And his government compIeteIy
changed education poIicies -
- so that among other things
they canceIIed the grant
This meant mom couIdn't afford
to study to be a nurse
This is disgusting! PIease,
I don't want to do this anymore
Stop fiIming Stop!
I toId you I didn't want to
PIease, cut it out
Just fucking Ieave me!
I don't want to taIk!
I did something I pIanted a tree
Hi! I picked a fruit
Hi
Because deep in the darkest forest
in there,
there is a speciaI kind of tree
That has a very speciaI fruit
growing on it
I picked a fruit Iike that
It Iooks Iike a IittIe heart
And when you hoId it in your hand
it beats
So I took it
to your schooI pIayground
So tomorrow when you go there,
a tree wiII have grown
You can sit under that tree,
in the shade
and hide
Because when you sit
in the shade of that tree
then none of the big,
nasty boys can see you
They can't touch you
When you sit in the shade of that tree,
you're invisibIe
They can't see the tree either
Because it's invisibIe
OnIy you can see it
Then no one can hurt you
LittIe one
I'm not a virgin here
I'm not a virgin here
But, here
Here, in between
I'm a virgin there
No one's ever touched me there
Tess?
