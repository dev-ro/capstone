Is the baby okay?
What?
Is the baby okay?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. She's fine.
What are you doing?
I was just checking on her.
Come.
I just have to work here
a little bit longer.
Go back to sleep.
You have to relax.
You should sleep.
Yeah.
Shh.
Hmm.
Relax.
Better?
Shh.
Can you take her
for a minute?
- Okay.
- I'm gonna change her.
All right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, whoa.
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Shh.
It's okay.
You know what you have to do,
right?
The victim has to be
a prostitute, but what type?
And she has to speak English.
The terror must be in English.
Once the ice pick makes
its appearance, though
she'll probably try to run
and scream.
In any case,
the first step is to get her
tied up and gagged,
that means S&M.
Of course,
you need a change of clothes.
There will definitely be
a lot of blood.
Hey, what time
is the car coming?
3:00.
Okay.
Will you call me
as soon as you get there?
Uh-hmm.
Uh-hmm?
You can call me anytime,
okay?
Yeah.
I mean,
you can call me anytime.
I mean it, okay?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
Hi, baby.
Hey, did you check in?
Yeah. Yeah,
I just got to my room.
How is it?
It's good. It's small.
Nothing fancy.
They couldn't put you up
somewhere nicer?
No, It's fine.
I'll be busy, you know,
I won't be in the room much.
Do you have to do anything
for the conference tonight?
No.
No, no meetings till tomorrow.
But, uh, But,
I gotta go to dinner.
I just wanted to call,
let you know that I got in.
Okay. Well, have fun.
We miss you.
Okay. I miss you, too.
I gotta run.
Hold on. Hold on.
Let me get the baby.
Hey, wait, I...
Say, "Hi, Daddy."
Come on.
Say, "Hi, Daddy."
She's being shy.
Well, we love you.
Try to relax
while you're there, okay?
Okay. Hey, listen,
Bill's at the door.
I don't wanna keep
the other guys waiting.
Okay. I love you.
All right. I love you.
I love you both
very, very much.
I love you.
I love you. I love you.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
I've never done S&M before
but I can ask
to tie you up, right?
I've never done S&M before,
but can I tie you up?
Oh, it's just there.
Sure.
Oh, after you. Huh.
You can undress
if you like, sure.
I think you're very nice.
Yeah.
Oh, really?
Small town.
What about you?
Oh, the city, huh?
Many of my friends
live in the city.
I just think it's really...
Clean, clean, clean.
Clean, clean.
Full run time minus cleanup,
14 minutes, 45 seconds.
Knock, knock, knock.
Hello.
Come in.
Hi.
I have an appointment
tomorrow night.
I was wondering
if I can change it to tonight.
Which hotel, sir?
The Prince.
Thank you.
If I may ask your room number,
we'll ring you right back
to confirm.
2902.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Sorry
- to keep you waiting.
- No.
The girl you made
your appointment with
won't be available
for a few hours.
Uh-hmm.
Would you like
to wait for her
or would you like us
to send you
a different girl right now?
Uh, no.
Send the one
that can come right away.
She'll be at your room
in approximately an hour.
Thank you.
It's Jackie.
Leave a message.
Hey! I haven't heard
from you in days.
Where the fuck is my money
from the other night?
You working today?
What the fuck is up?
Well, give me a fucking call,
okay?
I got you down
for an appointment tonight.
I swear to fucking Christ.
If you're just screening
my call...
It's Jackie.
Leave a message.
Okay, look,
your fucking machine.
I got cut off.
Leave your pager on.
If you don't have
your toys with you,
you'll have to stop
by the office first.
Whatever you do, don't show up
without your equipment.
Okay?
- Hello?
- Mr. Curran,
your guest is on the way up.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hello.
Come in.
Can I use your phone?
Yes.
Hey.
Hi, I'm, uh, I'm here.
All right, all right.
Uh-hmm, he seems fine.
All right.
Come by the office today,
will you?
Okay, bye.
Can I get a drink?
Oh, sure.
Vodka soda.
Okay.
Neat freak?
What?
The... oh, never mind.
I've never tried
S&M before, so...
That's okay.
But I can ask you
to take your clothes off
and let me tie you up...
...right?
Anything, really.
What's the nastiest thing
you've ever done?
Do you like
to watch women masturbate?
Okay.
Then we'll take
a shower together.
I'll teach you
all about the elastic band
on the shower cap.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's... I'm gonna...
...take a shower.
Should I come with you?
Will you let me
tie you up after?
Oh, shit.
Hey, are you all right?
Listen, I'm sorry.
I wasn't laughing at you.
Can you hear me?
I'm sorry.
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, is everything okay?
I'm coming in.
Okay?
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay.
Okay.
Just don't.
Uh, Mr. Curran?
Is everything all right, sir?
Everything's fine.
As you may be aware
that all of our rooms
are occupied tonight
and some of our guests
are already sleeping,
so we would very much
appreciate it
if you can keep the volume
at least as low as possible
when enjoying music
- or television.
- All right.
Of course. Um, sorry.
I'll keep it down.
You could still
kill her, though.
What?
Thanks
for your cooperation, sir.
Have a great night.
Are you the one
that takes me to the hospital?
Yeah.
Do you think
I can have the scissors?
It's okay.
It's okay.
No.
- No.
- Don't be scared.
- No.
- Please drop it.
Please drop it.
Please drop it.
No, it's okay.
It's okay.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, listen.
No.
Lie on your back.
Please listen.
Hey, can you hear me?
I'm just gonna clean you up,
when you wake up
you need to go to the hospital,
do you understand?
Hey.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
Did you take something?
Hey?
It's okay. Oh, God.
Come on.
Have you seen my wife?
What?
My wife.
I can't seem to find her.
It's okay,
I'll ask the front desk.
Shouldn't have
to bother strangers.
Oh, no.
I seem to have left something
in my room.
Have a good night, sir.
Help.
Help.
No, no, no.
Help!
Get off of me.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, can you hear me?
Can you understand me?
You want to go
to the hospital, right?
Yeah? Okay.
All right. Well, you need
to get clothes on.
You need to get dressed.
Huh.
I don't know
where they are.
Okay.
All right, all right.
I'll get those, stay here.
Can you stand?
You're so calm and dignified.
Hmm.
Really very handsome up close.
Thank you.
I know why you really called me.
What?
You aren't here...
What do you mean?
Are you coming in?
Uh, no.
I don't like hospitals
but I'll be right here.
Shouldn't they take
a look at your hand?
I... no, I'll be fine.
So, you'll just be here?
Yeah, of course.
And you're gonna stay
with me tonight?
Yeah.
You promise?
Yeah, I promise.
I think she knows.
How sure are you
that she knows?
I don't... I don't know.
A scale from one to ten.
Six.
That's not the worst.
Yeah, but what if she saw
the other stuff?
Like the chloroform?
Yeah.
You think she did?
I don't know.
It's gonna be fine.
And did you... did you tell her
about the girl with the rabbit?
Or the other
woman you stabbed,
you know, like,
to test the water?
No, no, it didn't really
seem right, you know,
but in the cab, I mean,
it's seem like she knew,
you know, and she seem like
she was okay with it.
With you killing her?
Yeah.
I think
she's okay with it.
I see this playing out
in one of three ways.
Do you wanna know?
Well, yeah, of course.
That's why I called you.
Okay.
The first one is...
...she knows exactly
what's going on
but she's, like, batshit crazy
and wants to die.
She wants to die, you know,
so she won't say anything
to the doctor.
Just wait for her
and when she walks out
of the hospital,
take her home
and stab her, right?
It makes sense, right?
Yeah, all right, okay.
And what was the second?
What's the second?
Okay. The second one is,
it's the same but different.
It's like, yeah,
she knows exactly
what's going on
but she was just
playing along with it
to buy some time, you know,
like she was being fake,
so in that case...
...she's telling the doctor
right now everything,
you're kind of fucked up, baby.
Oh, God. I don't like that one.
I know.
That... that's... well...
that's the worst.
Hey, baby, you sound cold.
Do you have a scarf on you?
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me.
Baby, please, come on.
What's the third?
I don't want you
to get sick.
I'm totally fine, please?
- If you're sick...
- Uh-huh.
...the baby's gonna be sick.
Yeah, baby,
please, come on. Focus.
What's the third?
You promise me.
I promise, I promise,
I promise, I promise.
Okay, sorry.
Um, the third one is good.
The third one is...
...she didn't see a shit.
She doesn't know
what's going on,
so you should
just stick to the plan, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess two out of three
is pretty good.
Um, yeah.
I mean... odds say
you should probably
just kill her no matter what.
Yeah.
I was afraid
you won't really wait for me
but you did.
When I saw you,
I almost fainted.
It was like being in a movie,
like being the lead actress
in some big romantic scene.
Look at your face,
the most adorable thing
I've ever seen.
I just want to hit you.
Not just like a little slap
on the cheek,
I want to punch you with my fist
as hard as I can.
Can you stay with me forever?
No matter what?
I wanna watch you sleep.
Come on.
Here, try these on.
They're more
for the summer really
but they're nice, aren't they?
They're from Morocco.
I've got lots
of other kinds too.
See these?
Antique Chinese.
Isn't these so beautiful?
Of course they were
for bound feet
so you can't really wear them.
Um, those ones
can be a little scratchy
if you're not wearing socks
but with socks,
they're really comfortable,
don't you think?
Do you want an espresso
or would you rather have
like a beer or gin and tonic
or something like that?
Espresso's good.
Okay.
I just got
this new machine.
It's, um...
it's a professional model.
It's from Germany.
Your apartment is very nice.
Did you decorate it yourself?
Uh-hmm.
I don't really spend
much money on anything else.
A lot of girls like to go out
drinking and clubbing
and stuff like that
but I don't.
I don't really spend much money
on clothes either.
I like to build my wardrobe
little by little,
you know what I mean?
Just buying the pieces
that I really like.
- Thank you.
- Is that okay
if I put on some music?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you mind
if I take off my makeup?
Okay.
How did it go at the hospital?
Oh, of course.
I forgot we have to put
something on your hand.
I have some, um, antiseptic.
Do you want me
to put it on for you?
You need food.
I make really good soup.
I mean, it's just instant,
but instant can be really good.
The trick is knowing what to add
like tonight
I'm thinking I'll add
a packet of cream consomme
and some curry powder
and some milk.
Regular milk and condensed milk
because it complements
the sweetness of the corn.
And it's more
nutritious that way.
Curry powder on the other hand,
that is a little bit different.
Just a tiniest bit
of curry powder
accentuates the sweetness
of the milk.
Bet you didn't know that.
So tell me the truth.
What?
The reason you sent for me.
I know it wasn't really for S&M.
Are you embarrassed?
No.
What did you tell them
at the hospital?
About what?
What did you tell the doctor?
About what?
About me.
That you took me for a ride
on my bicycle
and I fell off.
What?
Yeah, bikes.
They've got all sorts of things
like sticking out
all over the place like a thing
to hold your water bottle
and gears and chains,
and things like that.
I mean, I'm not
an exercise junkie
or anything
but I read about it
in one of those
outdoorsy magazines.
So, like, a lot of people
get cuts on their legs
when they fall.
I mean, I don't think
if he believed me,
but I guess he didn't care.
What do you mean?
He seem busy
or maybe because
of the other scars,
I guess he couldn't be bothered.
Other scar?
Yeah.
Do you wanna touch them?
Want me to do this to you?
Don't you wanna do it to me?
You don't have to be afraid.
Does it bother you
that the curtains are open?
I want to keep them open.
I want to look at all
the beautiful buildings.
All the lights.
Feel that?
You know what that is, right?
Silk.
I bought these sheets
two weeks ago.
It's nothing like this
that you could get
from Korea or Taiwan
that you buy
in department stores.
Even cheap silk
is warm to touch.
This is different.
Imagine me lying here
and you looking down at me.
And these sheets getting wet
with all sorts of things.
Just think about
what that could be like.
Think about it.
First you touch the sheets
like this.
Then after that,
you touch my skin.
I want you to wear my skin.
It's okay to make a mess.
Have you done anything
like this before?
Once...
when I was a teenager.
But...
I've thought about it...
ever since.
And I finally decided
to try it again tonight.
Get it out of my system.
Get it out of your system.
Where are you going?
To get my kit.
For what?
For what I was gonna do
at the hotel.
So are you just gonna tie me up?
Well, yeah. Sure.
Are you gonna leave me after?
No.
Can we eat first?
Shit.
Did I put too much
curry powder in it?
I'm sorry.
Was it too spicy?
No. No, it was good.
Oh.
It must take a lot of work
to keep up a place like this
so clean, hmm?
I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Remember me?
It's definitely
your first time
taking Halcion.
It's okay.
That ferocious panicky feeling
is totally normal.
It happened to me the first time
I tried it too.
To be honest, I'm surprised
that you're not out already.
Maybe I
should have given you more.
Do I remind you
of your mother?
When you're inside me,
you think about her, don't you?
And I think about your...
hairless, pasty,
little prepubescent body
flopping up and down
on top of me.
- Can't even make a fucking...
- Stop.
Pumping a chair.
Huh? When you cum,
when you make that face
- and it makes me gag.
- Will you stop?
Baby.
Disgusting little baby.
- Stop!
- Ugh!
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Baby.
Let me get that for you.
Mona!
Mona!
Help me, Mona!
I'm not Mona.
Your father said
I should have aborted you.
He was right.
There's something wrong
with you.
All right, mommy.
I'm sorry, mommy.
I'm sorry, mommy.
Don't apologize.
If you say you're sorry,
you'll only get beaten harder.
Just tie yourself.
I doesn't hurt, baby.
I just wanted to make you happy.
Why ice pick?
What?
That's funny.
Now, you just set this
thing,
but it's not gonna hurt.
But there is a trick,
is you have to believe it.
Because if you think
it's gonna hurt,
even just a little bit...
then it will.
Oh.
Ahh.
Oh.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You have to believe
that it won't hurt,
do you understand?
Hey...
do you understand?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
Now, I'm going to stab you
with an ice pick, okay?
I'm going to stab you.
Ice pick.
Hang on.
I have to get my ice pick.
Stop. Stop.
No.
It's almost over, okay?
Don't move.
Stop. Don't move.
I said don't move.
I thought
this is what you wanted.
I thought
this is what you wanted.
I thought you wanted this.
I thought you wanted this.
Okay.
Shh. Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
In any case,
the first step
is to get her tied up
and gagged.
That means S&M.
Of course, you need
a change of clothes.
There will definitely be
a lot of blood.
Then the ball gag.
That one that will completely
seal her mouth.
She must be able to vocalize in
at least a minimal way.
The victim
has to be a prostitute,
but what type?
And she has to speak English.
The terror must be in English.
One the ice pick
makes its appearance though,
she'll probably try to run.
Maybe I should drug her.
What if she fights back?
What if she hurts me?
Maybe that wouldn't be so bad.
Morning.
What are you doing?
Hmm?
What are you doing?
I want a way to remember this.
Can we eat first?
