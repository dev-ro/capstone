- Where do you want it?
- Right there.
They look after us on this show.
You know, you guys are really too much.
And I want to introduce you...
to the guys individually in The Who.
Because you never get to know their
names. You know them as The Who.
Everybody says, "Who?"
And you say, "You know."
- What's your... So what's your name?
- Pete Townshend.
- Pete. And where are you from, Pete?
- London.
- From London? London where?
- London, England.
Hey, where did you learn to play...
You know, that's a wild style of playing.
Where did you learn to play
the guitar like that?
That was bowling. Bowling.
Bowling.
Yeah, I could tell.
Now we move right along...
right over...
- Right over here. And you're...
- John.
- You're John. And you're from...
- London too.
From London too?
And you must be Roger.
- I must be.
- Well, are you? You're Roger?
- And where are you from?
- Oz.
Roger... Here's Roger from Oz.
And over here is the guy
who plays the sloppy drums.
You follow the Yellow Brick Road.
What's your name?
- Keith.
- Keith.
My friends call me Keith.
You can call me John.
Okay, John.
I'm gonna...
I'd just as soon call you Roger.
Roger from Oz, what's the next
song you're gonna do?
- "My Generation."
- Your generation.
I can identify with that, because
I really identify with these guys.
I dig them.
And this is...
You got sloppy stagehands around here.
Okay, that's enough!
They're gonna sing "My Generation."
This song really goes. And you're
gonna be surprised what happens.
Because this is excitement. And hit it.
"My Generation."
People try to put us
- Down
- Talking about my generation
- Just because we get around
- Talking about my generation
Things they do look awful cold
Talking about my generation
I hope I die before I get old
- Talking about my generation
- This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
- Why don't you all fade away
- Talking about my generation
I said don't try and dig
what we all
- Talking about my generation
- Say
I'm not trying to cause a
- Big sensation
- Talking about my generation
- I'm just talking about my generation
- Talking about my generation
My generation
It's my generation, baby
Why don't you all
- Fade away
- Talking about my generation
I said ya don't try and dig what we all
- Talking about my generation
- Say
I'm not trying to cause a
- Big sensation
- Talking about my generation
- Talking about my generation
- Talking about my generation
My generation
This is my generation, baby
My, my
Generation
Talking about my
My generation
I'm talking about
Hey, Dick, I'd like to borrow
your bass for a minute.
And now, here is your Shindig host,
Jimmy O'Neil.
Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen. Howdy-Hi, Shindiggers.
Well, tonight is our very last Shindig,
and we're going out with a bang.
And boy, we've got
a bang-up gas for you...
starring Billy J. Kramer
and the Dakotas...
The Who, Dave Berry, Ian Whitcombe,
Sandy Shaw, The Kinks...
The Barron Knights, Twinkle
and, of course...
our own Blossoms and Wellingtons.
So what do you say
we get ready to live it up.
Because here we go with our kickoff tune
tonight called "I Can't Explain."
And here to sing it are The Who.
- Got a feeling inside
- Can't explain
- It's a certain kind
- Can't explain
- I feel hot and cold
- Can't explain
- Yeah, down in my soul, yeah
- Can't explain
- I said
- Can't explain
- I'm feeling good now, yeah, but
- Can't explain
Dizzy in the head
and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said
well, maybe they're true
I'm getting funny dreams
again and again
I know what it means, but
Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
when I feel blue
- But I can't explain
- Can't explain
- Yeah, hear what I'm saying, girl
- Can't explain
Dizzy in the head
and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said
have got me real mad
I'm getting funny dreams
again and again
I know what it means, but
Can't explain
I think it's love
Try to say it to you
when I feel blue
- But I can't explain
- Can't explain
- Yeah, one more time, yeah, yeah
- Can't explain
I said I can't explain, yeah
You drive me out of my mind
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind
Yeah
I said I can't explain
Terribly sorry, Russell.
- Does this not belong to you or us?
- Have a seat. Have a seat, old love.
Drape yourselves
all over the upholstery.
Who does that machinery belong to?
Does it belong to you or to us?
- Bank manager.
- I mean, who has to pay for it?
- It's mortgaged.
- It's all right.
It looks all right.
A lot of people live in there.
- We've got 83 deposed Pakistanis.
- Stop interrupting!
- Do go on.
- It's no good now.
- I've lost my nerve now.
- All right. Let me... Let me...
- Let me take over then.
- All right.
Now, you've been together now as a group
for how many years? Ten years?
- Yeah. I'm leavin'.
- No, wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on.
Was it that long?
Christ Almighty.
It's known as the decay ofThe Who.
Was it the decay?
- The decline ofThe Who?
- The decade ofThe Who.
- Oh, the decade.
- Who decayed?
Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
No, no, no, no, no, no
Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only
Teenage wasteland
Yeah
Sally, take my hand
Travel south across land
Put out the fire
Don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older
Teenage wasteland
Oh, yeah
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
Oh, yeah
It's only teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
- Everybody do you feel alright
- Sure, we feel alright
Everybody is so good
You feel alright
- Yeah, yeah, we feel alright
- Ah, yeah, do you feel alright
- Yeah
- You know you make me wanna shout
- Shimmy
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna shout
- Shimmy
- Oh, yeah, you're gonna shout
- Shimmy
- Ooh, yeah, you're gonna shout
- Shimmy
- Oh, baby, you know
I walk up to the front
Try to do the flop
I walk up to the back
I move from side to side
- And then I
- Shout, shimmy
Oh, yeah, now
- Shout, shimmy
- Ooh, yeah, and then I
- Shout, shimmy
- Ooh, yeah, and then I
Do a little thing
I never did before

- Shout, shimmy
- Do you feel so fine
- Feel alright
- Come on, everybody
Everybody gonna shout
You make me feel real good
Everybody clap your hands
Come on
Come on, come on
Baby, feel alright
Alright
Do you feel alright
Alright
Everybody gonna clap your hands
- Clap your hands a little louder
- Shout
- A little louder
- Shout
A little louder
That's good
- Shout
- Everybody
Shout
Let's bring ourselves together.
You've been together for ten years.
That's a decade.
You haven't yet decayed.
Apart from the Rolling Stones, are you
the longest surviving together group?
- Are you not?
- We're not together.
What are the strains that you have
suffered together, if at all?
Bastard!
It seems it's just beginning.
It's such a long story.
Shall I start in 1963?
- Start at the beginning.
- Well, we started off as...
- A small family butcher firm.
- The fantastic thing about The Who...
is that we're all incredibly nasty.
- You are or were?
- Were. I mean, we're...
- Still were.
- His feet are nasty as well.
Christ.
Go on, mate. Carry on.
So we were nasty...
- God.
- Carry on, Russell.
- I don't want it.
- You just carry on, Russell.
Go on.
You sure it's worth...
It it gonna be worth seeing?
Well, a young man
Ain't got nothing in the world
these days
I said, a young man
Ain't got nothing in the world
these days
Well, you know in the old days
When a young man was a strong man
All the people
they'd step back
When a young man walked by
But, you know, nowadays
It's the old man
He's got all the money
And a young man ain't got
nothing in the world these days
I said
You know he ain't got
Ain't got nothing
In the world these days
Well, everybody knows
Everybody knows
That a young man
ain't got nothing
There it goes
In the old days
Everybody stepped back
When a young man walked by
And they'd step back
They'd step back
There's a film here, or an account,
of one week exactly ten years ago...
when you'd played in that week
at the Social Club in Goldhawk Road...
and The California Ball Room
in Dunstable...
and the Railway Arch in Neasden.
And what you made that week was £370.
And what you'd spent was £1,946.17.6...
including £785
on the replacement...
of guitars, drum kits and microphones.
Who covered that gap in money,
that £400 gap...
which left £1,300
to find every week?
It's hard to say.
I used to rush
into Marshalls Music Shop...
and steal guitars off the wall.
I'd say, "Just taking a guitar,
pay you Tuesday," and rush out.
Kit Lambert, our manager then,
would say...
"A photographer from the Daily Mail
is in the audience. Smash your guitar."
I'd smash the guitar
all over the stage.
He'd come back,
"Pete, Pete! Sorry. He missed it.
Can you smash another one?
I'll give you the money."
And as soon as I started
smashing something up...
Keith, who's a great
sort of joiner-inner...
used to smash up his drum kit.
Well, I suppose all his friends
have been on here...
'cause, you know,
I'm only one of several.
I've told you about all the mad things
he's done in life...
such as, you know,
breaking up rooms...
driving his car into swimming pools,
driving his car into foyers.
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
about any of that.
You know, I'm just here to tell you...
about the Keith I know and love,
you know?
Keith, what's your opinion
of your public image?
I think it sort of varies
with every record I put out.
I think sometimes...
Could you get on with it?
Keep... Will you keep it together?
No, I think I'm very reliant
on my management...
and my public relations people.
This country's in a weird,
feeble, grotesque state...
and it's about time
it got out of it.
And the only... the reason
it could get out of it is rock music.
And I think that Townshend, The Who,
Roger Daltrey, Entwistle, Moon...
could rise this country
out of its decadent, ambient state...
more than Wilson and those crappy
people could ever hope to achieve!
Tommy, can you hear me
Can you feel me near you
Tommy, can you see me
Can I help to cheer you
Ooh, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy
Tommy, can you hear me
Can you feel me near you
Tommy, can you see me
Can I help to cheer you
Ooh, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy
Tommy, can you hear me
Can you feel me near you
Tommy, can you see me
Can I help to cheer you
Ooh, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
What about the little singer?
What's your opinion of him?
I think he does
a damn good job out there.
Personally, I mean,
I wouldn't go out there up front...
with nothing to protect me
but a small microphone.
But he manages to revolve it so fast
that when people do throw things...
he gets sort of desiccated egg
and sliced tomato.
I turn my cymbals up this way...
so that at the end of the night
I have a salad mixed.
I just sprinkle some salt
and some Italian seasoning on it...
and that sort of
really ends up my evening.
Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
He plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
He's a pinball wizard
Has to be a twist
Apinball wizard's
got such a supple wrist
- How do you think he does it
- I don't know
What makes him so good
He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets a replay
Never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
I thought I was
the Bally table king
But I just handed
my pinball crown to him
Found my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
There are some elements in the story
like the image in the mirror...
the pinball...
and the sensibility in general...
"See me, feel me, touch me, heal me..."
which reflect, in a certain sense...
the phenomenon of youth subculture.
There is narcissism.
There is a kind of new sensibility.
There's a strong tendency
for playing up things...
and no more pulling it...
into aggressive forms
of counteraction.
- Isn't this silly?
- Yeah.
See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me
See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me
See me
Feel me
Touch me
Heal me

- Thank you.
- Good.
Thank you.
The end of the '60s, that seemed
to sum up an awful lot about rock.
It was the time when... I mean,
you were the great star of Woodstock.
Woodstock itself was one of
the biggest pop events in world terms...
because of the film that masses
and millions of people have seen.
And It was a marvelous thing in its way.
But just as a matter of interest,
what do you think it changed?
What was different after it? What did
that generation, all those people...
I mean, given the same time by
the same thing and yourself and such...
what did it change?
- I'm just interested to know.
- Well, it changed me. I hated it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
The Who.
You have to resign yourself to the fact
that a large part of the audience...
is sort of thick, you know,
and don't appreciate quality...
however much
you try and put it over.
The fact is that our group hasn't...
hasn't got any quality.
It's just musical sensationalism.
You do something big on the stage...
and a thousand geezers
sort of go, "Ah!"
It's just basic
Shepherds Bush enjoyment.
- I can go anyway
- Way I choose
- I can live anyhow
- Win or lose
- I can go anywhere
- For something new
Anyway, anyhow
anywhere I choose
- I can do anything
- Right or wrong
- I can talk anyhow
- And get along
- Don't care anyway
- I never lose
Anyway, anyhow
anywhere I choose
Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines
that been laid before
I get along the way I dare
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere
Our sound appeals to mods
in that it caters for aggression.
For example, when for a brief period
I stopped smashing guitars...
kids started shouting out, "Smash your
guitar, Pete! Smash your guitar!"
And getting quite annoyed
that I wasn't.
'Cause to a large percentage of geezers
that come to see the group...
they paid their money to see me
hit me amplifier with the guitar...
and see a guitar break, you know.
A lot of girls come to see the group
because of various things...
which people in the group wear...
such as John's jacket and medals...
and my jacket made out offlags...
and Keith, who wears sort of fab gear...
pop art T-shirts made out of targets
and hearts and things like this.
Because the group is
a fairly simple form of pop art...
we get a lot
of audience this way.
Off stage, the group get on
terribly badly.
There's a lot of despite and things
which flash around.
The singer's a Shepherds Bush geezer
who wants everything to be a big laugh.
And when it isn't, you know, he thinks
something's going wrong... terribly wrong.
The drummer is a sort of
completely different person...
to anyone else I've ever met.
The bass player just doesn't seem to be
interested in anything, you know...
which makes it all very difficult.
You've been together ten years.
You must have been subject...
to a great deal of
strain and inner tension.
- And now, can I ask...
- We do try and ignore each other.
We've always been very close,
you and I, haven't we?
- No.
- One of the things is that...
- In the history of the group is that...
- I loathe Pete Townshend.
- Keith and I have always got on well.
- This group has no history.
- And I've hated it ever since I began.
- One of the things too is...
- since I do the bulk of the writing...
- He does no writing. I do most of it.
- I do most of the lyric work.
- He thinks he does the lyrics.
Friday night
I'm on my way home
They oughta make work a crime
I'm home for the weekend
I'm gonna make the most of my time
There's a rock and roll singer
on the television
Giving up his music
Gonna take up religion
Deserted rock and roll
To try to save his soul
Saturday night
Got a gig with the band
Playing the electric guitar
Someday I'm gonna make it
Gonna be a super-duper star
Get a big, flashy car
And a house for my ma
Pull!
- The big break better happen soon
- Pull!
- 'Cause I'm pushing 21
- Pull!
Just like Cinderella
- When she couldn't go to the ball
- Pull!
A voice said
I'm your fairy manager
You shall play at Carnegie Hall
I'm gonna give up my day job
To become a heartthrob
I may go far
If I smash my guitar
What about musical quality, though?
You said that...
you don't think your group has got any.
- Why don't you try and give it some?
- But if you don't...
If you... If you steer clear of quality...
you're all right, you know.
No, really.
This is the truth, you know.
But wouldn't you say the Beatles
and people like that...
have a certain musical quality?
Ooh, you know...
that's a tough question, all right.
Actually, this afternoon, we...
John and I...
were listening
to a stereo L.P. Of the Beatles...
in which the voices come out
of one side...
and the backing track
comes out of the other.
And when you actually hear
the backing tracks of the Beatles...
without their voices,
they're flippin' lousy.
I was born with a plastic spoon
in my mouth
The north side
of my town faced east
And the east was facing south

The first major American tour
was by bus.
We traveled from...
We went from coast to coast...
and from Miami
we'd go up to Canada.
It was pretty awful.
We used New York as a springboard.
We used to play for Murray the K.
We used to do five shows a day then.
And we had three minutes to do our show.
So we used to do one and a half minutes
of"I Can't Explain"...
and one and a half minutes
of"My Generation"...
smash your guitar and run off,
you know.
Five times a day,
seven days a week.
In those days,
your performances used to end up...
with you smashing all your equipment.
There were stories about you
smashing hotel rooms on every tour.
All lies.
Not a word of truth.
Well, according to people,
at the time it certainly was true.
I mean, why was there all
that violence surrounding you?
Well, this was...
this was only last week, wasn't it?
What made us first want
to go to America and conquer it...
was being English.
Not because we cared a monkey's
about the American dream...
or about the American drug situation
or about the dollars or anything.
It's because we were English kids,
right...
and we wanted to go to America
and be English.
Pop music is-is crucial
to today's art...
and it's crucial
that it should remain art...
and it is crucial that it should...
that it should progress as art.
Happy Jack wasn't old
but he was a man
He lived in the sand
at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing
He would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head
in their furry donkey
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied
And lied
But they couldn't stop Jack
or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack
from feeling happy
But they couldn't stop Jack
or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack
from feeling happy
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
And lied and lied and lied and lied
And lied
They couldn't stop Jack
or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack
from feeling happy
Girls came to see you, mainly,
to look at the clothes you wear.
Don't you think that most of them come
for a certain sexual thrill...
- they get out of your performance?
- Look, you know, our group's...
probably one of the most unglamorous
on the stage today, you know.
I mean... No, really.
I mean...
this is one of our...
was one of our big problems, you know...
and probably still is, you know, is that
the group didn't have enough glamor.
It was all clothes
and-and smashing things up.
And it was all mechanical things.
It was bricks and stones and things...
and not enough sort of
normal group things, you know.
We made our...
second... second album,
which he produced.
And it was during that album which,
as I say, Kit Lambert produced...
that we really realized
what making albums was all about.
You know, we had great fun.
It was very creative.
And Kit was learning
about record production...
and doing crazy things, like...
recording the group
from a microphone down the corridor...
and all these things which are
very commonplace nowadays, but...
Using incredible amounts
of compression...
and squeezing the sound up.
Squeezing symbol sounds up to
make them sound like steam engines...
and various, sort of...
twiddling knobs
as the recording was going.
The engineers throwing
their hands in the air...
"Them's platinum-coated knobs, mate.
You can't do that."
And all this was going on
in the studio, but unfortunately...
we had ten minutes on the album
to fill when we'd finished.
And so Kit turned 'round to me
and said...
"I think you should write
something linear...
something with continuity...
perhaps a ten-minute song."
So I said, "You can't write
a ten-minute song."
I mean, rock songs are two minute,
fifty by tradition.
It's one of the traditions.
They only allowed you
one modulation...
four chords or five, you know.
Five chords, you might be up
before the committee.
Ten minutes? It's ridiculous.
So he said, "Well, listen,
if you can't write a ten-minute song...
write a ten-minute story...
made up of two minute, fifty songs."
Which I did. And that was
the mini-opera, it was called.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
dig The Who.
Two, three.

Little girl guide...
why don't you stop your crying?
Here comes Ivor, the dirty
old sooty engine driver...
to make you feel alright.
My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver
I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through
He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar
I ain't either
So let's have a smile
For an old engine driver
Let's have a smile
For an old engine driver
Soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
Soon be home
Soon be home
Oh, yes
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
Soon be home
Soon be home
Dang, dang
Dang, dang
Dang, dang
Dang, dang
Cello, cello, cello, cello

Cello, cello, cello, cello

Cello, cello, cello, cello

Cello, cello, cello, cello
cello, cello, cello, cello
I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me
Am I back in your arms
Away from all harm
It's like a dream
To be with you again
Can't believe
That I'm with you again
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
I missed you and
I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him
Had a nap
- You are forgiven

Forgiven, forgiven
Forgiven, forgiven
Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven

Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven

You are forgiven
You're all forgiven
What we have to do is
we have to decide whether or not...
we're gonna remain the circus act,
right, or whether we're gonna...
in other words, doing
what everybody knows we can do...
and what we know we can do, right...
until the band eventually turns into
a cabaret act which is inevitable.
That is ridiculous to say that.
I mean...
- That's it.
- Okay, Keith.
Brand him right on the heel! Yea!
I've heard a lot about you and the rest
of the group taking drugs, Pete.
Does this mean you're usually blocked up
when you're actually on stage?
No, but it means we're blocked
up all the time, you know.
Well, Keith, we've heard you drink
a lot, but that's beside the point.
If you could tell us, you know...
how did you... how did you
happen to join The Who...
and if in fact that's what
they were called when you joined?
Well, I've just been sitting in
for the past 15 years, you know.
They never actually told me
that I was part of the band.
I knew it by instinct.
Keith Moon rolled up one day
all ginger all over...
ginger shoes, ginger corduroy trousers,
ginger jacket...
and his hair dyed ginger,
holding a glass of brown ale.
So this complete ginger
sort of vision...
came up and said,
"I can play better than him."
And this horrible impudent
with his hair down like this...
and got up on
the drummer's drum kit...
and practically
smashed it to pieces.
And we thought
this is the man for us.
Hi, I'm Ralph Baines speaking to you
for the Hewitt House Hotels...
the rock star's home away from home.
Don't be alarmed.
I think I know what's going on.
Let's get some information across before
the fun and games break loose again.
What were you before
you kicked off as a group?
- He was almost as interesting as...
- What do you know about it?
- What?
- Inland Revenue Income Tax.
- You said you were in land rover.
- Yes, sometimes.
- In the back.
- Inland Revenue Income Tax.
So, what did you do?
Me? All sorts of things.
- Like what?
- Be more specific. He wants specifics.
I want one thing that you did
before you joined as a group.
Were you digging a garden or what?
- He was born in a boat.
- A sheet metal worker.
- A sheet metal worker?
- Yeah.
He was a rust repairer.
I was a rust repairer
and a full-time survivor.
I survived
all the major earthquakes...
and the Titanic
and several air crashes.
I think you'll have to give me
a few lessons in survival.
'Cause if I'm gonna survive this
interview, I'll need a few lessons.
The makeup department
is looking very worried over there.
- I need more brandy. I mean, lemonade.
- That's right.
And you were doing what?
He didn't work.
Arty-farty, he was.
You leave me out of this.
We're talking about me.
God! Oh, no! No!
Oh, no, Keith.
It's the breakup of the group.
That's what he was doing,
developing his muscles.
Keith, leave me alone!
- Well, they have to ask you this.
- I know.
You know.
- What do you think about Pete?
- I love the man.
He is one of my dearest friends...
but I couldn't say...
Ringo, if Pete said,
"What do you think about Ringo?"
You know, we have our moments
and when we get together...
there are certain times
that just something happens...
and I really don't know what it is,
but there's that magic there.
- It's probably we're drunk.
- It could be that.
Not drunk, teenyboppers.
I mean...
No, absolutely not,
you Donny and Marie fans.
- Keith and me had a lot of medicine.
- Absolutely.
- You know, just a lot of medicine.
- We're getting on.
We're getting on now.
We need our medicine, so...
You know, just see
the age of this suit.
When I'm on the stage...
Let me try and explain.
When I'm on the stage,
I'm not in control of myself at all.
I don't even know who I am,
you know.
I'm not this rational person
that can sit here now and talk to you.
If you walked on the stage with a
microphone in the middle of a concert...
I'd probably come close
to killing you.
I have come close to killing people
who walked on stage.
Abbie Hoffman walked on
the stage at Woodstock.
And I nearly killed him
with me guitar.
A cameraman walked on the stage...
A policeman came on...
when the bloody building at the Fillmore
in New York was burning down.
And I kicked him in the balls
and sent him off.
You know, because I...
You know, I...
I'm just not there really.
It's not like being possessed.
It's just I do my job.
And I know that I have to get into
a certain state of mind to do it.
We'd realized the end of our tether.
We'd reached it.
We'd come upon the point when the...
the nosebleeds and all that,
and you know, they're no good.
You can't go on doing that.
It's no good.
It's beyond the beyond.
Ba, Ba, Barbara Ann
"Barbara Ann"?
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Barbara Ann
- We'll have to go and have a look.
- Go and get a doctor, please.
Yeah, get a doctor.
Now then. Now then.
No, that's the key.
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Barbara Ann

Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Barbara Ann

- Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Barbara Ann
You got me rockin'and a-rollin'
Rockin'and a-reelin'
- Barbara Ann
- Now the solo?
Went to a dance
lookin'for romance
We did that bit there.
Does it come in twice, that bit?
Oh, Keith.
Look at old Moon.
I mean, one main ambition now is
to get back on the road...
with the horrible Who, the worst
rock and roll group in the world.
- "The worst?"
- Yes.
You couldn't pick more...
four more horrible geezers...
that make the worst noise
that you've ever heard in your life.
Yeah, I'm a roadrunner, honey
I'm a roadrunner, honey
And you can't keep up with me
Yeah, I'm a roadrunner, honey
And you can't keep up with me
Come on, let's race
Baby, Baby, you and me
Oh, baby, that's all
Move over, rover
Come on, let's race
Baby, Baby, you and me
Baby
You've got to help me
People try to put us down
Just because we get around
Things they do look awful cold
I hope I die before I get old
This is my generation
This is my generation
Why don't you all fade away
And don't try to dig
what we all say
I'm not, not, not, not trying
to cause a big sensation
I'm just talkin'
about my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Talkin'
Talkin'
Talkin'about my
My, my
My, my
Alright
One of the reasons for having...
sort of music
and things fantastically loud...
is 'cause you get so many people...
who sort of just
turn deaf ears to what you do.
You know what I mean? They sort of
just won't listen to what you do.
And it doesn't matter
how good or bad it is.
In fact, the bigger it is,
normally...
the more they'll close
their ears to it.
So the louder you gotta...
you gotta work, you know.
Volume is a fantastic thing.
Power and volume.
Power and volume.
When I went to get me ears tested,
the bloke was really encouraging...
apart from the fact
that he said I had...
- Terrible ears.
- I had terrible ears.
He said... Bill said,
"Well, what advice would you give him?
Would you tell him
to stop playing entirely...
and leave the group?"
- "Throw his career out the window?
- Throw his career out the window?
- Would he?"
- Become a pauper, starve?
Would you tell him that?"
"Well, now, actually, no, but I would
advise him to learn to lip-read."
That's what he said.
It's true. That's what he said.
Get out.
Have all of you made enough money
to stop work this afternoon... tonight?
I could buy and sell you
just like that.
- Yes, I have.
- You have? Why don't you stop then?
Because he has to support me
and the rest of the boys.
You mean, you've made more money
than they have?
- Well, I write all the songs.
- He writes the songs.
No, I write the songs.
If you write songs,
you get a bit on the side, you know.
You see, the thing is...
as a songwriter,
I do have something...
you know... you know, an edge.
- Going for you.
- Something going for me, yes.
We go for him.
Scab.
Carry on, Russell.
- I'm transfixed by it all.
- Yeah?
I don't know why I'm here.
In "My Generation," you wrote,
I hope I die before I get old."
- Do you in fact mean it?
- Yes.
There's a guitar up here
if any big mouth little git...
wants to come up
and fucking take it off me.
Rock and roll's got no future.
It don't matter.
We became rich a lot later
than I expected.
Now I'm too old to enjoy my money.
Excuse me. We just shot a lot
of film with the interview.
And talking about all that...
- I was wondering...
- Heard the worst.
Now could you really tell us
the truth and stop lying?
Oh, no.
It... I mean, the truth
as you wanna hear it?
I can't do that.
You couldn't afford me.
But you're a very
different person now...
to the desperate young man
of the early '60s, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm a desperate old fart now,
not boring though.
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who, who, who, who
I woke up in a Soho doorway
Apoliceman knew my name
He said
You can go sleep at home tonight
if you can get up and walk away
I staggered back to the underground
The breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin'punches around
and preachin'from my chair
- Well, who are you
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
- I really wanna know
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
- Come on, tell me who are you
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
- 'Cause I really wanna know
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rollin'Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
with a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
I looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way
- Well, who are you
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
- I really wanna know
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
- Oh, who the fuck are you
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
- I really wanna know
- Who are you
Who, who, who, who
Who are you
Who are you
Who are you
- Who are you, Who are you
- It's good, isn't it?
Who are you
Who are you
Who are you

Come on, tell me who are you
- Are
- You, you, you
- Who are you
- You
Hey!
Ow!
So there!
I've been saving this.
You all behave in this crazy way
the whole time.
- You're all married, aren't you?
- Eh?
No, no, no.
I wouldn't marry this lot.
- That's a great sleeve, that.
- If you touch my bleeding sleeve...
- His sleeve...
- He's getting stroppy now.
He says you leave his sleeves alone.
They're personal them, eh?
Can't touch the interviewer,
can we? Eh?
No, he's in command, isn't he?
He can make everybody else
look a right twit...
as long as you don't
have a go at him.
How long you been
happily married then, eh?
Go on, then.
- You really do have a lovely lifeline.
- Have I a long lifeline?
- Pity about the warts.
- No.
Not too long. I should say
about another two minutes.
Ladies and gentlemen, before
my lifeline, according to him...
is two minutes long, which means
we've got to end the program.
We'll be back, God willing, same time,
same place next week.
- Good night.
- He's so smooth.
This is where it all ends.
- People try to put us down
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
- I say just because we get around
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
- Things they do look awful cold
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
- I hope I die before I get old
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
- Why don't you all fade away
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
I said, don't try
and dig what we all say
Talkin' 'bout my generation
- Not tryin'to 'cause a big sensation
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
- Just talkin' 'bout my generation
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
- Why don't you all fade away
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
I said, don't try and dig
what we all say
Talkin' 'bout my generation
- Not tryin'to 'cause a big sensation
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
- I'm just talkin'about my generation
- Talkin' 'bout my generation
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
My, my
Generation
I can't think of anything to say.
Rock and roll's never
ever stood dissecting...
and inspecting it
at close range.
It just doesn't stand up.
So shut up.
There is a place for us
I am accused of...
letting the side down,
as it were...
often by... by our fans, you know.
Like for example, you can't...
stop doing this.
You can't stop doing
what you're doing because...
you know, you'd let down
all these people.
It's not people just saying, "You'll
disappoint your fans if you don't go on.
The show must go on."
You must go on, otherwise
all those people will be so upset.
It's, "You've gotta go on, man.
Otherwise, all those kids,
they'll be finished.
They'll have nothing to live for."
That's rock'n'roll.
We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship
will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide
and the shotgun sings the song
I tip my hat
to the new constitution
Take a bow
for the new revolution
Smile and grin
at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
The change, it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold
That's all
But the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners
they are flown in the last war
I tip my hat
to the new constitution
Take a bow
for the new revolution
Smile and grin
at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no, no, no, no
I'll move myself
and my family aside
If we happen
to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers
and smile at the sky
Though I know that
the hypnotized never lie
Do ya
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced
by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now parting on the right
And the beards have
all grown longer overnight
I tip my hat
to the new constitution
Take a bow
for the new revolution
Smile and grin
at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no, no, no, no
Don't get fooled again
Yeah
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
Down at the Astoria
the scene was changing
Thank you.
Bingo and rock
were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band
to vomit in the bar
And find the distance
to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at 10:00
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock
Long live rock
I need it every night
Long live rock
Come on and join the line
Long live rock
Be it dead or alive
People walk in sideways
pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup
and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley
selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box
wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub
the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock
Long live rock
I need it every night
Long live rock
Come on and join the line
Long live rock
Be it dead or alive
Landslide, rocks are falling
Falling down around our very heads
We tried but you were yawning
Look again
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
Rock is dead
The place is really jumping
to the Hiwatt amps
Till a 20-inch cymbal fell
and cut the lamps
In the blackout they danced
right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open
even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off
and the rafters knock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
Long live rock
I need it every night
Long live rock
Come on and join the line
Long live rock
Be it dead or alive
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know 'em all pretty well
But I know sometimes I
Must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids, they're alright
The kids are alright
Sometimes
I feel I gotta get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away
And I know if I don't
I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids, they're alright
The kids are alright
