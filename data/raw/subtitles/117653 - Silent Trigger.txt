Ground zero to eagle one and two, copy.
Eagle two copy.
We have target acknowledgment.
Yeah.
- Range on target?

- It's time.
- Green light.
Red light. No clear shot.
Open fire.
Negative. No clear shot.
Eagle one, this is an order.
Open fire now!
- Negative.
- Target obstructed, Sir. Do it!
Eagle two, eagle one has
malfunctioned. Terminate him.
Damn it, man, just do it! Just do it!
This is an order: Terminate eagle one.
- Go!
- Repeat, terminate eagle one!
Go!
So where do we go from here?
Open the fucking box.
Slowly.
Oh, shit. Mushrooms.
I told you, no mushrooms.
Now I gotta pick 'em off.
One by one.
I'm not laughing.
How about I buy a beer?
Make you feel better?
Trust me, after a couple of nights,
you'll be begging for a little excitement.
This is on e boring tomb.
I'll let you know when I'm that bored.
You do that.
Cheers.
What's this?
Oh, shit. I hope my cable isn't out too.
I'm taping the game.
Shouldn't we be doing something?
Bingo! Back on line.
I'm gonna check it out.
Check what out?
If you don't wanna talk to me,
why don't you just say so?
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- Well, fine.
How long they got you on the shift for?
'Cause I'm having you shifted to mornings.
You're one hell of a pain in the ass!
Eager be avers.
God bless him.
O'Hara?
O'Hara, are you there?
Come on, O'Hara. Copy.
Copy if you're there, O'Hara.
Yeah, yeah. What's up?
A woman with a work order.
Says she's supposed to check out
some computers in the penthouse.
Computers? In an empty
suite on a Sunday night?
What a concept.
Nobody said we'd be having any company.
She must be making one
shitload of overtime.
May I?
That's right. And the people that are paying
your salary are not gonna appreciate...
me wasting my time and
their shitload of money.
Of course. I'm sure they
just forgot to notify us.
Okay, pal. Stop wasting the lady's time.
I'm sure she doesn't wanna be here all night.
I don't.
You'll have to excuse
the accommodations.
Nobody's been too anxious to
cough up the cash to finish this...
- Piece of "techno - Shit"?
- Yeah.
Techno - Shit. I like that.
Elevator's right here.
You know, I could get into this
computer stuff myself. I mean,
- How difficult could it be, right?
- Yeah, right.
So what do you do with them?
I deal with electromagnetic
field interference.
- Like radioactive microwave bullshit, huh?
- Just like that.
How come management never told me
about the penthouse being rented?
I don't know.
Maybe you're just out of the loop.
Ah, yeah. Well, I don't
like being out of the loop.
Especially with some smart-ass bitch
just popping out of the woodwork.
Come here.
T.F.B.
What?
Too fucking bad. Now start the elevator.
You wanna be tough, huh, bitch?
You have five seconds to take
your sticky little fingers off of me.
Four...
You haven't got the balls.
That's about to be your problem.
Three...
- I don't think you can do it.
- I'm sure it's not much of a target,...
but we're at real close range.
So what now,...
- Pretty lady?
- You rest...
for a minute...
and I'll drive.
You know, you're just
a type "a" computer geek,...
right down to your little plastic
pocket protector for your 357.
Well, there's a lot of creeps out there.
See you later.
Not if I see you first.
Fuck! Bitch.
You look worked up.
Shut up, man! I liked you better
when you didn't say anything.
That fuckin' bitch pulled a 357 on me.
Shit! What the fuck is she doing with a 357?
Smoking pimps on market street?
How about keeping a
scumbag like you at bay?
You know, fuck that shit.
What are you doing?
I'm calling the cops to
find out If that gun's legit.
No cops.
You're new around here, so I'll
let you in on a little something.
In this building... we're the cops.
Red.
Two-five.
You.
Ground zero. Ground zero.
This is eagle two.
Ground zero, this is eagle two.
Do you copy?
- Copy.
- I'm at the primary extraction point.
LZ - 1 is hot. I repeat, hot.
This is a priority one...
Eagle two, repeat your priority.
You scared the shit out of me.
- I thought you were dead.
- I'm not.
Listen, there's no time to be scared.
No radio. Repeat, no radio.
We have 12 hours to reach the secondary
extraction point, so check your weapon.
Clean up your face.
Thanks.
- How long you been with the agency?
- A while.
This was my first mission.
Shit.
Okay, rookie.
There's been a major
operational screw - up.
That chopper found us somehow.
If we weren't set up,...
- Had to be the radio transmission.
- What do you mean, "set up"?
It means trust is not a virtue,...
so do what I say, when I say it.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Okay.
Back there, that was my first kill.
They tried to kill you.
Do you remember your first kill?
I didn't have a choice.
There was a war going on.
The difference is, in war,...
at least you know who the enemy is.
Surprised?
It's not the word I'd use.
Maybe history's repeating itself.
This time is different.
It's never different.
Why did they have to send you?
Because I get along with everybody.
- I wouldn't brag about that.
- Why not?
Some people are better
not getting along with.
Someone's coming.
That way it's easier to kill them.
Pretty lady. Come on, open up.
Open the fucking door!
- I just wanna talk.
- I'd like that.
But I really can't right now.
I have this delicate equipment at work.
How about working on my
"delicate equipment"?
- What do you want?
- I just wanna apologize for before.
You know I didn't mean anything by it.
Apology's accepted.
Now get lost!
You're just making it fucking difficult
on yourself being a bitch again!
That's okay. Really doesn't bother me.
Because I'd really love
to treat you like one.
And your fucking 357
ain't gonna stop me.
Guess you didn't get
along with him, did you?
Take the knife down.
Ever seen your agency profile?
It's classified information.
- You didn't answer the question.
- I haven't seen it.
I've seen mine. Says I'm... paranoid.
Do you think I'm paranoid?
Not necessarily.
I think you may have been
on the job a little too long.
Nice.
Well,...
looks like I have at least
one reason to be paranoid.
Listen to me.
I'm not a rookie anymore, and I'm not
gonna take an y of your shit, all right?
I have a job to do,
and the weapon is part of it.
I'm your spotter,
and we both know procedure.
Exactly. That's why I'm keeping the gun.
I had no idea that it was you. None.
I swear.
I would've taken a section delta.
Why didn't the supervisor tell you?
I don't know.
I've never even met the guy.
You don't meet the guy. When you meet
the guy is when you know you're dead.
Yeah, well, that's the
paranoid speaking.
I wish it was.
Not good.
- Not good at all.
- What's your fucking problem, man?
I was just about to ask
you the same thing.
We're the cops in
this building, remember?
That's right.
And you left the ground station
in the middle of a shift.
- Your shift.
- That's bullshit.
What that is, is me doing your job.
And frankly, they don't
pay me enough for that.
I was checking things out.
- Like what, the curve of her behind?
- Ah, screw this shit.
I'm writing you up.
What?
I think you heard what I said.
Son of a bitch.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck her. Fuck 'em all.
Let's get on with the program.
I know the drill.
Do you?
Gimme the dope on the parameter.
Two security guards.
One's new and by the book,
the other's a bully.
- Nothing special.
- All right.
Let's get up close and personal.
Fifty caliber match grade.
Hardened tungsten - Carbide penetrator.
High explosive incendiary core.
Heavy armor piercing.
Outstanding. Maybe I'll have
you pull the trigger this time.
I'm just the spotter, remember?
Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting
why you're here.
It looks like she's working in the dark.
Did you hear what I said?
They're fixing the building.
Who's fixing the building?
My buddies.
Your buddies?
They don't like what's going on here.
Boys!
Say hello to my new co - Worker.
Very lifelike.
They don't like her all alone up there.
So I'm gonna have some fun tonight.
Something funny going on with her.
Maybe we should have
checked her out some more.
I did check her out.
And me thinks me likes what me saw.
What are you doing there?
Just getting prettied up for my date.
Would you mind telling
me what's going on here?
Body armor.
Threat level 4-A. Serious shit.
She's gonna love this.
All right.
We're to greet the target at
the base of the bridge at 0800.
The vehicle, possibly armored,
traveling north-south at 40 miles an hour.
Dope me a preliminary range.
1800 to 2000.
It's a hell of a shot.
That's more than a mile.
Right.
I'm going to the roof.
Why are you going up there?
Procedure, spotter.
Always secure high ground.
Yeah, well, that falls
under my job... and my gun.
What gun?
Can't quite seem to recall right now.
There's an old saying:
"Just because you're paranoid...
doesn't mean they're
not out to get you."
Yeah, well that's not a saying.
It's a joke.
An old joke.
Really?
I never laughed.
Down.
What's wrong?
Just wait here. Keep your eyes open.
So much for keeping your eyes open.
- Shit.
- All right, kid. Let's go.
Limo's waiting.
So, how are we doing?
Great. Mission was a failure and
we're running for our lives.
- Yeah, well, I meant time wise.
- We'll be there by dusk.
Weren't we supposed to
approach by the water?
- What are you doing?
- Slide over and drive.
Yes!
That'll give you something
else to do besides talk.
Are you looking for me?
That was not funny,
sneaking up on me like that.
You mind telling me what you
were doing on the roof?
What are you talking about?
We got a warning signal
from the security system.
Well, your system is malfunctioning.
You're telling me you
didn't open that door?
Why would I open that door?
I'm working in the penthouse.
You know, I think your buddy
has you a little jumpy.
He's not my buddy.
Then is this settled?
Because I'd like to go back to work.
It's settled.
Anything else?
I don't think so.
Good.
Because I wouldn't want you to come
all the way up here again for nothing.
Come on!
Come on! Grab me.
So how's the paranoia level?
Under control.
Yeah?
Well, don't get too comfy.
Hey, spotter.
Thank you.
Forget it.
It's just part of my job,
keeping you alive so you can do yours.
This time.
Soldier's best friend.
I'll pass.
Jesus Christ!
Me and that chopper didn't get along.
- No shit!
- Want to play doctor?
What the fuck is this?
Shit. Don't stop. Run 'em over.
Keep going.
Passport.
Duck!
I told you not to stop.
Range.
Eighteen hundred.
I shouldn't be here.
Not after last time.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Why not?
Too much was lost.
Well, how would you get it back?
You don't.
Ever?
- I don't know.
- Well, what do you know?
I think we should at least...
Well, I told you I'd be back.
I've been expecting you.
My partner's very worried about you.
Tell your partner I really
appreciate his concern.
Well,...
how about my concern?
A little short of breath?
Oh, fuck you very much.
"Ker-pow"
Now I can show you my piece.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Slow down.
We don't wanna forget safe sex, do we?
We can do this the easy
way Or we can do it...
the fucking hard way.
Which way do you like it?
The hard way.
Who the fuck are you?
- Who do you want me to be?
- How about dead, asshole?
I'll fucking blow her brains out.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take your best shot.
You first.
No, no.
After you.
Three's a crowd.
Hey, hey!
Come on! Dance, boy!
She's a hell of a date!
Come on.
Come on.
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck are you?
- You have no idea who you're dealing with.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, first I'm gonna take
care of this piece of shit.
And then I'm gonna come
back and fuck you to death.
Don't go anywhere.
Hold on!
Take my hand!
It's a great day to fly!
Fasten your seat belt.
G-1? Penthouse.
Ground station. Copy.
Just making sure you stay put.
Is there a problem?
I think I'm gonna get some.
Really? Well, enjoy.
You may not know this,...
but you're one lucky scumbag.
You okay?
You want me to leave you alone?
Let me ask you something.
We both knew you had to do it, right?
Do what?
Was it because of the sniping
station or because of me?
Does it matter?
It does to me.
Do they have names?
Who?
The people we kill.
They're not people. They're targets.
No names, no faces, no identities.
You mean you never wonder?
Never.
The moment you hesitate,
that's when you know you're finished.
It wasn't because of
the sniping station.
What?
I heard a sound.
It's the wind.
I learned about the wind.
In the war?
Yeah.
The enemy was different then, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Tell me what changed.
The war ended, but the hunt didn't.
I started to doubt.
I started to see...
the eyes of the enemy.
The face of the enemy.
It was the face in the mirror.
Let's go!
How far to the extraction point?
One or two wars away.
I'm not laughing.
We're never gonna make it.
We're dead.
You're not dead till I
tell you you're dead.
Keep your head down.
And don't go anywhere.
Ground zero, ground zero,
this is eagle two. Do you copy?
Ground zero, this is eagle two.
Do you copy?
- Copy.
- Shit. We have a double red here.
Have you terminated him?
What the fuck,
we're under fire right now.
That's the order.
He didn't fire on the target.
- He's expendable.
- Now listen up, you son of a...
Eagle two.
Eagle two, do you copy?
Eagle two, you have a termination order.
He's gone, hasn't he?
It's a long way down.
What are we gonna do?
You do what you have to do...
and so will I.
Oh, shit, man!
Help me out here!
Taking a lotta crap lately?
That ain't funny. There's nothin'
fuckin' funny about this, just...
Just get this shit off me,
you fucking asshole.
Resisted your
irresistible charms, did she?
Well, don't take it too hard.
You and that toilet...
you look very good together.
Where you going? Where you going?
Come back! Hey!
She didn't do this to me, you know.
- There's a fuckin' guy up there.
- Who might this individual be?
I don't know. He's a fucking
mean son of a bitch.
We're calling the cops.
He could come down here any second.
I don't think that's an option
the gentleman is considering.
Yeah, I don't give a
fuck what you think.
Some days it's just not worth
getting off the toilet.
Supervisor to all stations.
Stand by.
Let's do it right this time.
After all...
this is the end of the line.
What are you talking about?
My final target.
Ground zero to eagle one and two.
Target approaching kill zone.
Eagle two copy.
We have target acknowledgment.
Eagle one copy.
- Range.
- Two thousand, decreasing.
Wind age.
Full force crosswind:
15 knots standard.
Bring it right.
Ten clicks.
Target entering kill zone.
Mid - Sector.
Range: On target.
Nineteen hundred, forward lead.
Four mills.
It's time.
We have green light.
Those who don't remember the past...
will be condemned to live it again.
Do it.
You're all grown up now.
You do it.
Looks like someone didn't trust us.
Well, you didn't fire on the target.
- Do what you have to.
- You didn't do your job.
You didn't do it then...
and you didn't do it now.
Just remember the face in the mirror.
You can walk out of here.
Out of the whole system.
We can both walk.
Some retirement party.
So where's the bar?
Do you know who I am?
I do now...
Sir.
It's a real loss.
He was the best.
You hesitated.
Which leads me to believe
Either you couldn't kill him...
Or you didn't want to.
You have a chance to
come back to the family.
Don't hesitate again.
I won't.
I guess if you want a
job done properly...
you just have to do it yourself.
Well, that would be an
unnecessary overkill...
Sir.
- Seems we have a problem.
- We certainly do.
- You are way out of line.
- And it is such an imperfect world...
isn't it?
I am done with the
order of the day, Sir.
Well, then, If it's all
the same to you...
I'll be leaving.
Ma y I offer you a ride?
I'm in no particular hurry.
It's a long way down to the bottom.
I'll walk.
Guess what?
The elevator is out of order.
Nothing new.
Life's only death postponed.
I told you to walk, didn't I?
