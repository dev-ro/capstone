Hi, angel! Hi!
They're doing so much better now
and they're happy.
Want some chicken?
Hey! Down.
Mommy.
Ronnie.
Come here, sweet girl.
Chicken.

[R&B MUSIC PLAYING]
This is not happening.
[laughs]
Okay, is that one cooked?
No, this is not.
Definitely I not give it for you.
They're really good.
It's so good.
Yeah, me and Taylor are fighting,
so that sucks.
And I'm like just in
a different time in my life now.
I just don't like... I just like...
I don't know.
I just feel like my threshold
for, like, bullshit with men is...
it's just-- I don't have one anymore.
I just don't care.
I don't know if it's
because I'm 30 and I'm...
I feel better than ever, you know?
All my insecurities are gone,
I don't feel insecure about who I am
as a woman. I don't--
I'm not... embarrassed or ashamed
of what I have.
I just feel like a more sexier, sexual...
like all of that shit is better,
and so what I think what happens is,
is like...
I don't know.
Well, in relationships, you have to...
I don't know.
You got to move together, I guess,
as much as you can.
[man] What are the balloons for?
Warner Brothers greenlit a movie...
that Bradley Cooper's directing.
And Bradley wanted me to be in it.
A Star is Born.
And, um...
you know, I'm going to star
in the movie.
- How's your girlfriend?
- [woman] Good!
It's tight.
It spasms on the right.
It's not all the way up my shoulder yet,
into my...
I mean, a little bit. It's not that--
It's the QL. Yeah.
If I get depressed, my body can spasm,
like, into a full body spasm.
And it all kind of originates
from this trauma in my hip
from this injury years ago.
I wrote this new song.
I started it yesterday,
and sent it to Mark this morning,
and he sent me
some guitar stuff back already,
so when I get there, we'll maybe do that.
So many, I think, men in my life,
in business and also that I've dated,
you know, over the years,
I just started to feel like what I was
on my own wasn't good enough.
And I don't feel that way
working with Mark.
- [doorbell rings]
- [Lady Gaga] Koji.
Oh, bigger, better deal.
Bigger, better deal!
They probably don't know who I am.
They probably think I'm just some crazy
old lady who lives down the street.
I'm thirty. I'm old to them.
I think my back
probably looks really good.
Like a Polynesian scarification ritual.
Is it?
- It is. Turn around.
- Is it bad?
An Englishman with cupping
is really funny. I don't know why.
I'm going to look like such a badass
on the beach in Mallorca.
Like, "Don't fuck with that dude.
He's into some weird shit."
- What do you think?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hey!
[man] How are you?
- Hello!
- How you doing?
Thank you for drawing me
that weird Xanax monster.
Oh, right. I forgot about that.
The last time I had a camera
in front of me was the Born This Way tour.
[Mark] Oh, the Born This Way tour.
When I, like, broke my hip,
it's been like three years since then,
but I'm still dealing with it,
and I was just like, "Whoa."
Like life is so crazy.
[Mark] It's only three years
since Born This Way tour?
I think so.

[Lady Gaga] When you reference or nod

Because I've experienced that
with people feeling
like I was taking from them, right?
I have now learned going--
Looking back at what they were saying
and going, "Oh, my God. No."
I was totally, like, honoring."
And so, the thing with, like,
me and Madonna, for example,
is that I admired her always,
and I still admire her,
no matter what she might think of me.
[man chuckles] Okay.
- No, I do.
- Yeah.
The only thing
that really bothers me about her
is that I'm Italian and from New York,
you know?
So, if I got a problem with somebody,
I'm gonna fucking tell you to your face.
But no matter how much respect
I have for her as a performer,
I could never wrap my head
around the fact
that she wouldn't look me in the eye
and tell me that I was reductive,
or whatever.
She's never given you a call and been
like, "What the fuck you doing?"
No. I saw it on fucking TV.
Telling me that you think I'm a piece
of shit through the media is like...
it's like a guy passing me,
like, a note through his friend.
"My buddy thinks you're hot.
Here's his, like--."
Fuck you. Like, "Where's your buddy"

[man] Remember when we played it in,
we were maybe gonna do it...
When producers, unlike Mark,
start to act like they're the one--
You know, "You'd be nothing without me."
For women, especially.
It's those men have so much power...
that they can have women
in a way that no other men can.
Mm-hmm.
Whenever they want, whatever they want,
the cocaine, the money,
the champagne, the girls,
the hottest girls you've ever seen.
And then, I walk in the room,
and it's like...
eight times out of ten,
I'm put in that category.
And they expect from me
what those girls have to offer,
when that's just not at all
what I have to offer in any way.
[man] Right.
[Lady Gaga] Like, that's not why I'm here.
I'm not a receptacle for your pain.
You know what I mean?
I'm not just a place for you to put it.
Right.
And you felt like you've had to do,
like, extreme shit
to put yourself out of that category?
I mean, like, what's the methodology?
The methodology behind what I've done
is that when they wanted me to be sexy
or they wanted me to be pop,
I always fucking put
some absurd spin on it
that made me feel
like I was still in control.
Right.
- I know. Fuck it.
- So, you know what?
If I'm going to be sexy on the VMAs
and sing about the paparazzi,
I'm going to do it while bleeding to death
and reminding you
of what fame did to Marilyn Monroe.
Right.
The original Norma Jean.
And what it did to Anna Nicole Smith.
And what it did to...
Yeah.

[instrumental music playing]
[Lady Gaga] My sort of thought of her
is that she fled from Scotland,
because if she was a witch, you know,
these were women
that were fucking burned.
Right?
So, whenever she becomes more powerful,
she has to flee.
And I think that this is also,
like, something that women have to do.
You know,
whenever you become powerful
in a relationship or in business,
there's always opposition.
And being a woman was like,
you were owned.
And women, I think, still are
very much owned in a lot of ways.
[Lady Gaga with accent]
Plagued with misfortune.
The voyage was plagued with misfortune.
Many men died.
The soldiers blamed me
for their tumultuous journey.
Journey.
For their tumultuous journey.
The soldiers blamed me

I'm doing my record, I have things to do,
I haven't slept,
this is not the only job that I'm doing,
I'm trying to do a good job.
When they come and they told me
because of the dialect--
- Fucking tell me beforehand.
- These two days of crazy shit.
Don't take it there.
So the kiss will happen
after I go around him.
Correct.
Yep.
Got gum in my dentures.
[woman] They're in there.
I had a little baby meltdown today.
Small. A little one.

Huh?
I just-- I don't--
I like to know what I'm doing.
- Before.
- Yeah.
I don't mind changing on the fly.
But with something this complicated
when they keep throwing shit at you...
- Yeah.
- That's like...
I just don't want to sound German.
You know what I mean?
[CAR APPROACHING]

It-- I got-- I hit Mark's car.
I don't even know how I did that.

- Is it his car? I can't--
- [Mark] Yes.
I'm so sorry.
I wish if you have a problem with me,
just tell it to my face, not to my bumper.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all good.
- Is it bad?
- Yeah.
- I mean, does it--
- My car is fine.
[Mark] But what if-- but--
It's all right.
Hi! You look so beautiful.
- No...

I just didn't feel good enough.
And I do now.
I know I deserve-- that I--
Of all the things I deserve,
that is where I know I'm worth something.
So I have to stay there. You know?
[Lady Gaga] I want to become a woman
in this business and grow up.
I mean, you become famous at 21 or 22,
it's like you stop growing up.
I want to become a woman.
Because the truth is that I can always
bring my past with me,
but I can never go back.
You got to leave yourself behind.
And I've just been so lonely,
and I was on the phone
with my mom and my dad, and--
[Mark] And then he came out because
you're like, "Dad, I need you out here"?
Yeah, I was like--
I just told them I was--
They were like, "What's wrong?"
And I was like, "I'm fine."
And my mom just said,
"You don't sound okay."
And I said, "I'm lonely."
And I didn't know that my dad
was sitting right next to her
because they--
She was at the manicure place,
but my father goes
to get manicures sometimes.
It's just hysterical. It's like all women
and my dad just sitting there like...
He knows that I could go home every day,
and it's...
It's a really big house.
It's pretty fucking awesome.
Yeah, but what guy is going to be like,
"Oh, sweet pad!"
And that I'm going to be into, like--
And just like throw their shoes off,

I'm going to be like--

Anyone. I don't know.

We understand you. Without--

Don't worry about it. I don't--
Like really, it was such a good--
Sorry. I just-- It feels better.
I don't want you to feel bad about it.
Really, the truth of the matter is,
I just want to have a uniform.
And I think my uniform should be
a black t-shirt, and black jeans,
and black boots,
and I just wear that a lot,
and we get versions of that made.
You know what I mean?
You've gone from the meat dress
and you've turned it up even more.
You know, you've gone-- That next album
was even turned up even more.
And I think to strip back to black
is just a go
with exactly what you just said.
Like that uniform, I just think is gold.

You're going, going, girl? ♪
[Lady Gaga] So my album is called Joanne.
- [Darryl] Joanne?
- Yeah.
- Do you mind starting with--
- Sure.
It was my father's sister,
and she died when she was 19.
She went to the hospital
with my grandmother.
She was in there,
and there was something growing--
There was--
She had lesions,
or something was growing on her hands.
And the doctors in the '70s,
they didn't know what lupus was.
They didn't know how to treat it.
It's not curable, anyway. Even now.
So they suggested
that they immediately amputate her hands.
And seeing what that did to him
and to my family...
was the most powerful thing
I experienced growing up.
My family is
the most important thing in my life.
Yeah.
Joanne was an artist.
But what happened was that she...
My grandmother couldn't take
her hands from her.
So she just said, "Just please
let my daughter-- just let her go."
And she told me she went
into the waiting room
and she prayed to God that he take her.
Because she said,
"I don't want my daughter to remember
her last moments in life
without her hands."
So, you know, I am Joanne.
I am my father's daughter.
And so, that's what this record is about.
- That's very beautiful.
- Thank you. Thanks for listening.
- No, thank you for playing it.
- Thank you.
It's a gift to your father.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, this is it.
She's got this thing on her door.
- [Joe] She always leaves her door open.
- [Lady Gaga] It's Ed McMahon.
- Ed McMahon?

Hi, Grandma!
Hello there.

[Joe] I could have a cup.
[Grandma] All right.
- This is what I wanted you to order.
- [Lady Gaga] Is this a peach?
- Can I have a peach, Grandma?
- Of course.
You can have anything that you find there.
It's like a vacuum.

this sexy picture of me over here?
[Grandma laughs]
Stefani.
It's my headshots when I was...
[Grandma] They're headshots.
I think I was 15.
I was a serious actress.
Here. This proves that she had braces.
Hey, if I had kept that gap, then I would
have even more problems with Madonna.
[Joe] Oh, that's true.
Oh, these are beautiful.
There is an album here
with something that she wrote.
That's one of her...
This is Joanne's handwriting, right?
"Hear what I'm not saying.
Don't be fooled."
I wear a mask. A thousand masks.
"So I play the game. The glittering
but empty parade of the masks."
What is that?
A poem she wrote.
[Joe] How come I never saw this album?
[Grandma] I was always afraid
you were going to raid it.
[CHUCKLES]
Grandma, this is awesome!
Whatever you want, honey, take.
"Directions for making things.
By Joanne Germanotta."
Oh, look at that.
"Joseph Germanotta
was lent one superball."
[Grandma laughs]
She used to make him sign that he bo--
Borrowed something.
[LAUGHING]
She would make him stop letting--
[Lady Gaga] "He may use it for one hour."
She had a great sense of humor,
I tell you.
She was a joy.
I got her for the 19 years.
[Lady Gaga] That's good.
[SIGHS]
- That's good.
- So...
You want to play the song for her?
You ready to hear it?
I guess.
It won't be as good quality
because it's just from my phone, but--
It's all right.
So we'll just play it,
and then if you get upset, we don't
have to talk about it. We'll-- you know?

I know. I just want to be sensitive.

[SOBS]
It's the whole right side of my body.
It's in a...
I don't know, a spasm.
It feels like there's a rope
pulling from my, like, first toe
all up my leg into my...
and then...
around my first rib...
into my shoulder.
And then, my neck.
And head, jaw.
My fucking face hurts.
Just breathe.
I just think about other people that,
like, have maybe something like this,
that are struggling to figure out
what it is,
and they don't have the quick money
to have somebody help them.
Like I don't know what I'd fucking do
if I didn't have everybody here
to help me. What the hell would I do?
[Tyler] I'm not sure what the blue one is.
This is the only blue thing in there.
- [woman] I have two...
- Do I look pathetic?
[woman] There's a blue face mask.
I'm so embarrassed.
And I don't even know, like,
what a childbirth will be like.
Or if I can.
I know I think I can get pregnant.
I just don't know, like, what are my hips
going to do? I don't fucking know.
I'm not afraid of, like,
those things like...
getting pregnant
and becoming older with my fans.
I'm excited.
I want to become an old rock star lady.
[woman] All we know
in terms of confirmation...
Here, let's put Trump on.
That'll knock me out.

Oh, but I love this hat.
With this dress.
[man] Yeah.
[instrumental music continues]
- Are they done with the suit?
- Yeah. We don't need to wear gloves.
I have them if you want them,
but with the hat you don't need it.
I think leave it for right now.
We only have 40 minutes.
- Yeah, let's just be quick.
- Let me blow dry it real quick.
Right? And then later we can wear it down.
- All right.
- Really, is that doable with our time?
What kind of lip now?
Just, like, natural.
Just natural and nude.
Yeah, I really like the ones
you showed me earlier.
I talked to Brendan this morning,
we have September 9th as the date.
- September 9th?
- Officially.
Five weeks from Friday.
Buckle up.
[Sandra] It's September 9th of what?
September 9th the single comes out.
[Bobby] Wait, so how's it going
in the studio? I'm dying.
It's good.
I mean, if you look at me during Artpop,
and then now, I think I'm doing better.
I'm just a woman struggling now
instead of a girl.

Okay.
Apple box, water, umbrella.
A mat for her to sit on.
You hold on. Just sit still.
Yeah? It's just up and down.
[man] Yeah, the van could come in
and pull to the side.
What did it feel like? Did it cramp up,
or did it twitch or shoot?
- Or what'd it do?
- It's...
It's inflamed.
I'm okay with it. I've accepted it.
But sorry, but for the three takes later
when the sun looks that beautiful,
I just want to do one more.
Okay, and remember we need everyone
to vibe and just have a good time.
Like we don't need anybody, like, dancing
and giving me "You Got Served."
This is not that party.

Without anything to cover it up.
It's not about, like,

This is from...

Surprise!
Oh, my God.
How are you?
- I like your shirt.
- Oh, my God! Thank you!
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God. It's going--
My favorite song of yours
is definitely "Born This Way."
I think it's really inspiring,
and whenever I'm feeling down or anything,
I go and put that track on,
and it, you know, inspires me.
- I'm so glad you love it. Thank you.
- It's one of my favorites.
All right. We're all-- Cut.
- And then...
- Nice meeting you.
I know that it's just for this radio thing
that they brought you in,
but, like, it really is so sweet
that you wait outside for me.
This means so much to me.
I'm glad we captured the moment.
I'll bring you back out.
- Come on.
- Bye!
Bye! Nice to meet you!
Don't forget her name
and give her tickets to a show.
Thank you so much for being you
and for your music and everything,
and I'm so glad I met you,
and it's seriously a dream come true,
and thank you for everything.
She's one of the few that actually,
like, genuinely cares about her fans,
and that's why I love her.
Sorry.
[man] Your audience, man.
They're in this for the ride.
You can tell,
because there's no other option.
[Lady Gaga] Well, you know, they're--
My fans are my heart and soul.
What happened in the last five years?
To everyone else, the world is yours,
and yet, I think people, real fans,
probably knew deep down
that there was something going on.
- It make you paranoid? Did you ever--
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Paranoia, fear.
- Alcohol?
- Oh, yeah.
- Alcohol.
- Drugs?
Drugs.
Uh... Uh... Uh...
- Anxiety?
- Anxiety, body pain.
The public announcement
that your marriage is breaking up
- and you've got to make a record.
- Well, engagement.
Let's not say marriage.
But yeah, very painful.
It's hard enough when, you know,
love isn't working out
the way you want it to
and you got to walk down the street
and have somebody go, "You okay?"
I had to go
into the deepest pain in my life.
I had to go into the part of myself
that you don't want to face.
[man] This record is like
the biggest change
we've seen in Gaga history.
- We're going to think of this new single?
- How does it feel to--
- Know we're all about to hear it?
- [man] What's your reaction?
What was going through your head?
[man 2] What is Twitter going to say?
What are the listeners going to say?
It's scary,
because, you know, you just don't--
If they don't like it,
it's like, "Well..."
It's my...
It's my life. You know, my life.
I can't wait for you to hear. It's very
personal in a way I just haven't been.
It's so personal.
It's a very personal title.
When it comes to revealing something
so personal about my...
I've never been that personal
with my fans.
I don't think that the world
was ready to see who I really am,
because I wasn't ready to be myself.
I'm saying this is me with nothing.
[LADY GAGA SOBBING]
I just want to make music,
and make people happy,
and, like, go on tour, and have a family,
and, like, I just can never get it
all right at the same time.
I'm always at a shoot
with some fucking great news
and my love life's imploded.
When I looked in that camera today
and I saw my eyes were dead,
why do you think
I was, like, so freaked out?
- Because I could see now.
- [man] Yeah.
I don't need to have a million wigs on
and all that shit to make a statement.
I know that we want to elevate everything.
I'm trying to elevate everything,
but, like...
I can't elevate it to a...
I can't elevate it to a point
where I become Lady Gaga again.
Yeah, because then it's like why even...
why did I make this record?
And then I'm like, "It's a sad day."
When it's like I'm doing the Super Bowl.
I'm like... I'm so excited to do it,
but I can't help but realize
that when I sold ten million records,
I lost Matt.
I sell 30 million, I lose Luc. You know?
I get the movie, I lose Taylor.
It's like a turnover.
This is the third time
I've had my heart broken like this.
But like, I'm just--
I'm alone, Brandon, every night.
And all these people will leave.
Right? They will leave.
And then I'll be alone.
And I go from everyone touching me
all day and talking at me all day
to total silence.
[woman] Bad news for Lady Gaga.
The entire album
has reportedly leaked online.
[man] She released
her fifth studio album, Joanne.
[woman 2] If you guys didn't know already,
Joanne actually leaked today--
[woman 3] One shop has already begun
selling the album early
leading to the leak.
[woman 4] These pop stars might want
to stop leaving their music laying around.
[Lady Gaga] My album's
on the internet right now. I just...
[woman] How do they even access it?
Because a record store in Belgium
decided to sell the album early.
If you could just bring me up to date.
I have this, like, real strong, uh...
- Like...
- Tension?
It's tension in my abdomen. It almost--
It just feels like my muscles are,
like, gripping all around my intestines.
- And it's so inflamed.
- Yep.
And my hip hurts every single day.
- Know your meds off the top of your head?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Synthroid for thyroid,
but that's not related.
I'm also on Mobic-- Mobics twice a day.
I have chased this pain down
for five years.
And the fury in all of this is that
- I'm fucking strong and I can still be me.
- Yep.
And when I feel the adrenaline
in my music and my fans,
- like, I can fucking go.
- Right.
- But it doesn't mean I'm not in pain.
- Right.
It sounds like you've been willing
your body to perform,
so in order to function, you're going
to have to shut down pain and emotions
- in order to do your job.
- Right.
- But I didn't know I was doing that.
- Right.
- I was on tour in 2012.
- Okay.
And not feeling good, but I--
Everything hurt.
- Yeah.
- Like I didn't know it was in--
- I didn't know. It's just everything--
- Right. Global pain.
- Global pain.
- Yeah.
- And mental pain.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and then my hip broke.
- Okay.
Okay, so let's do this.
So phase one is let's try to get you--
Get out of this intense pain
that's in your face,
where you feel you're running
from the tide all the time,
and I know there's a component of psych
that Dr. Modir is working on.
Phase two, let's try to get the muscles
to reeducate.
Phase three, we do the blood spinning
to try to cause regeneration.
- Okay.
- Okay?
So, I'll be back, and then I'll talk you
through the procedure, okay?
Do you have any questions for me?
[makeup artist] We have to get her ready
for this interview.
Hi, Dr. Katja, it's Stefani.
I'm at Dr. Aufiero's office.
And she wants to do
the trigger point injections.
It's just-- Anyway, here's the doctor.
Hi, it's Dr. Aufiero.
Hi. I'm good.
Yeah, you can call me Danielle.
Who gets their makeup done
while they're getting,
- like, a major body treatment?
- Yes, I can. So, just--
While this is all occurring, my album
is hemorrhaging all over the internet.
[Dr. Aufiero] Hello. Come on in.
So we'll do about four spots, okay?
You're doing great.
[GRUNTS]
Almost there.
The tighter the muscle, it's more intense.
Just the needle coming in.
A little cold spray.
[Lady Gaga]
Three hundred thousand downloads.
It's not right.
This is what I've been waiting to see
while I sit in that fucking MRI machine
for three hours at a time
and they tell me
to take Advil and Aleve.
[Dr. Aufiero]
You can see that darkness is the fluid.
You know, whatever. Fuck it.
Let them download my record.
I don't fucking care.
[Dr. Aufiero]
Sometimes it's better to just let it go.
I mean, I don't fucking care.
If I cry, will my face get puffy?
[crowd chanting] Joanne!
[woman] Her album is called Joanne.
[man] Lady Gaga's new album Joanne
is out today,
and the singer wants everyone to know
that songs are a radical departure
from the pop that launched her into fame.
[man 2] Lady Gaga's
pop-infused new record Joanne
has debuted at the top
of the US Billboard 200 album chart.
Gilberto, yes.
- Look, my first one.
- [man] Thank you so much.
- Will you sign my arm?
- Thank you so much.
I don't cry over anybody.
But this is a journey,
and this is a long time coming,
and this girl has my heart.
I fucking-- I love her.

because God makes no mistakes."

I'm setting up my breath,
and I'm getting my mind ready
to set the note right for this moment
so I can-- and I--
Right now, like, I'm not finding
the cameras.
When I'm supposed to find the cameras,
because I'm like, "Wait. Where am I?"
And I'm dizzy out there.
I mean, that's a 360 room.
It's not like I have a backdrop to go,
"Oh, here's the back of the stage."
Like, when I get turned around, I'm legit,
like, "I don't know where I am."
This lining is not going to work,
and I just--
We're changing it.
Okay, but they need to change it like now,
because I have to rehearse with it and...
This is making me nervous, is--
I know to other people it's like,
"Oh, no big deal.
It's just a lining of a jacket."
But for me, it's like,
the way that the fabric on my outfit
reacts to this fabric,
whatever that it is,
is going to change the speed
in which my arm enters the sleeve.
It's like a whole thing.
So every little thing that's not done
means more work for me Friday.
Means less time for me
to rehearse my performance.
- Everyone's tired.
- Okay.
Those dancers are tired.
I'm sorry, but I know those dancers.
They're fucking tired.
["BORN THIS WAY" PLAYING]
[APPLAUSE]
Feel my hip. Just put your hands on there.
I mean, it's for real.
Like I'm locked up.
Are you getting a little--
It's when I'm hitting--
That's what's hard right now.
I just don't want it to like--
I don't want to complain about it.
I just want to fix it.

[woman] Welcome to the Pepsi Zero Sugar
Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show.
[Lady Gaga] Hey, guys, can you get around
one second? Can you hear me?
Hey, guys.
This is the last one. Okay?
So this is the stamina run.
This is when you think you can't,
and you like need to, like, take a little,
like, extra breath here or there.
You don't.
You push through it, right?
You got to maintain
your own sense of your spirit.
So when you're out there now,
focus on you.
You know? It can get very distracting
out there with everything that's going on.
So just...
This one is about staying grounded
and biting it hard. Okay?
[applause]

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[NOISE FROM TV IN BACKGROUND]
- Did she see this?
- No, she hasn't seen it.
I'm so excited.
How cute is that?
Oh, my! There's lots of flowers.
Well, nothing like getting flowers
from your ex-fiancé for the Super Bowl.
No, you didn't! [Laughs]
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Actually, I will put them out.
Nice and proud.
It's very thoughtful.
I want to enjoy the day with my family,
but I've really got my eye on the prize.
After.
We have after. We have this evening.
And I don't feel as, like, angry and tired
as I did that other day.
[man] So how's this going to be different
from, like, other big shows you've done?
How is this show different?
Well, you know, I've never really done...
like a lifetime achievement, you know,
award, or a performance, like...
that was meant to celebrate my career.
And I feel like this is that moment.
And I was thinking this morning about it,
and the truth is that there really isn't
anything bigger than this.
So I better enjoy it today,
because it's not going to happen again.
And the country is so in peril right now
and in stress, and I think it's--
This is when it is most important
to be an artist, and shine.
The government doesn't have the power
to change anything in music or in art.
I think everyone's going to read into it
what they want to read into it.
I mean, that's the way this goes.
[fanfare music playing]
Whoo! [Laughs]
This is the biggest beauty pageant
we've ever done!
- You happy?
- Uh-huh.
Ashley and I just took a Molly,
so we'll probably be a little crazy.
[LAUGHING]
Yes.
That's so good.
You gotta be rolling.
This is the one.
Of your life?
Correct.
It's almost like a little bit sad.
[Brandon] No, it's not.
No, it doesn't get bigger than this.
So what do I do after this?
Everything. You're about to see your whole
world explode at 9:00 p.m. tonight.
You think so?
Your album's already all number one,
like, around the world.
You'll be in stadiums
for the rest of your life.
- We really should...
- Okay.
...start this process.
This is big.
It's really big.
It's big for me, but it's big for you too.
This is like a big moment
that you've master-managed.
- It's not easy to manage this.
- Yeah.
And you did it by yourself.
- You know, that's what I'm saying.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
- Thank you for staying with me.
You know?
- Okay, it's game time.
- Yes, it is, Richard.
- Let's do it, troops.
- Let's do it, troops.

[Ashley] Why is there a football game
before the Lady Gaga concert?
I'm doing the halftime show.

We're going to be late!

for your halftime show.
I'm doing the halftime show.

Oh, my God.

Hello.
[announcer] There's no score.
Back to work.

- Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I feel like I'm bothering you now.
No, you're not bothering me.
- I am so proud of you.
- Honey, it's 12 minutes.
- The last quarter went by really fast.
- Okay.
- Everybody suggested--
- [Lady Gaga] Okay.
[Donatella] I don't understand this sport.
I'm Italian.
[Lady Gaga] Donatella thinks
it's a beauty pageant for boys.
Oh, the Janet Jackson nipple covers
are going on.
I am focused.
I know you are.
I bet I watched every rehearsal,
and I had one major note for myself,
and it was to have fun.
I look like I want to kill everyone.
We have five.
Interception!
Oh, my God! No!
Okay, let's get those eyes on.
[Donatella] You look fierce.
Really.
- Shall we do this?
- Yes.
- Sorry, guys, we have to go. We--
- We're going right now.
Yes! Let's do this!

Hey, guys.
I don't know about you, but I've been
working my whole life for this moment,
so I'd like to thank you
for all your hard work.
Thank you.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[sobbing] Oh, my God.
- Amazing.
- It was good.
- Amazing.
- It was unbelievable. Unbelievable.
- Extraordinary.
- That could not have gone...
We got to perform
on the biggest stage in the world
with our beliefs and our diversity,
and I'm really proud of it.
I know, it was great. "A Million Reasons"
just went number one.
No way.
So there you go.
"A Million Reasons," number one.
Unbelievable.
[Lady Gaga] Yes!
Again, unbelievable.

I don't know. I just always feel
like when I'm with her and Jay-Z,
I'm always, like,
hanging out in the corner

hanging out of my mouth,
being like, "What's up?"
And she's just like, "You're not a lady.
