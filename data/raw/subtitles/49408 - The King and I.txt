Come on, lads, hurry!
We haven't got all day.
ls that it, captain?
Are we here?
Aye, laddie.
That's Bangkok all right.
Louis! Oh, Louis!
Mother! Look, there's Bangkok.
Yes, l know. lsn't it exciting?
Captain, l heard them lowering
the anchor. ls anything wrong?
We have to wait for the afternoon
tide to carry us over the bar.
Oh, l see.
Will the king of Siam come down
to meet us, Mother?
l hardly think so, dear.
lKings don't, as a rule.
Come forward, lads.
They need help in the bow.
Get along there.
That's the royal barge.
The king is coming out to meet us.
lt's not the king,
it's the kralahome.
Who is the kralahome?
A sort of a prime minister.
The king's right-hand man,
you might say.
May l look? Please, may l see?
Aye, laddie.
Ma'am, if l might be allowed to offer
you a word of warning...
...that man has power, and he can
use it for you or against you.
You must stop worrying about me,
Captain Orton.
Sometimes l wonder if you know what
you're really facing.
An Englishwoman alone
in a country like Siam.
Oh, it doesn't matter, captain.
l shall have work to do...
...and the king has promised me
a house of my own.
l'll have a place to bring up my boy
as his father would have wished.
Mother, look.
The prime minister is naked!
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Louis.
He can't be naked.
He's only...
...half-naked.
They look so cruel, Mother.
Father wouldn't have liked us
to be afraid, would he?
No, Louis. Father would not have
liked us to be afraid.
Not ever.
Doesn't anything ever frighten you?
Oh, yes, sometimes.
-What do you do?
-l whistle.
Oh, that's why you whistle.
That's why l whistle.
Whenever I feel afraid
I hold my head erect
And whistle a happy tune
So no one will suspect
I'm afraid
While shivering in my shoes
I strike a careless pose
And whistle a happy tune
And no one ever knows
I'm afraid
The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people I fear
I fool myself as well
I whistle a happy tune
And every single time
The happiness in the tune
Convinces me that I'm
Not afraid
Make believe you're brave
And the trick will take you far
You may be as brave
As you make believe you are
You may be as brave
As you make believe you are
l think that's a very good idea,
Mother. A very good idea.
Yes, it is a good idea, isn't it?
l don't think l shall
ever be afraid again.
Good.
The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell
For when I fool the people I fear
I fool myself as well
Mrs. Leonowens, may l present his
excellency, the kralahome.
Sir, you are lady who will be
schoolmistress of the royal children?
-Yes.
-He called you ''sir.''
Hush, dear, hush.
Have you friends in Bangkok?
l know no one in Bangkok at all.
His excellency wishes to know,
are you married, sir?
l am a widow.
What manner of man,
your deceased husband?
My husband was an officer
of Her Majesty's Army in....
Tell your master
his business with me...
...is as schoolteacher
to the royal children.
He has no right to pry
into my personal affairs.
He hasn't, Captain Orton.
l don't like that man.
ln foreign country is best
you like everyone until you leave.
You might at least have told us
you speak English, Your Excellency.
lt is not necessary for schoolteacher
to know everything at once.
You come with me now.
Your baggages shall be carried
to palace later.
Just a minute. Not the palace.
l am not living in the palace.
-Who say?
-The king say-- Says.
ln his letter of agreement,
he promised me 20Â£ a month...
...and a house of my own
outside the palace walls.
lKing do not always remember
what he promise.
Then you will have to remind him.
lf l tell king he break this promise,
l will make anger in him.
l think is better if king's anger
reserved for more important matters.
Very well, then. lf you are
afraid to tell him, l will.
l should like to see him at once,
while there's time for me...
...to return to England on this boat.
lKing very busy now.
Your Excellency, all l want is
a few minutes audience with him.
l have come here to work
and l intend to work...
...but l shall take nothing less
than l have been promised.
You will tell king this?
l will tell king this.
lt should be very interesting meeting.
You come now!
lf you change your mind....
Goodbye, Captain Orton,
and thank you for everything.
Good luck, ma'am.
-Goodbye, captain.
-Goodbye, laddie.
Take good care of your mother now.
lKing in bad spirit today.
Suggest schoolteacher wait
for better day.
My spirit is just as bad, your
excellency. l cannot wait.
Man is Lun Tha, emissary from
court of Burma.
He bring present to king
from prince of Burma.
Her name is Tuptim.
Why, that girl is a present?
For king.
lKing is pleased with her.
Sorry. lKing has concluded audience.
Well, you mean l cannot see him?
Not today.
Louis, come with me.
You cannot do this!
-Your Majesty.
-Who, who, who?
Your Majesty, is new English
schoolteacher.
Mrs. Anna Leonowens and son.
Louis Leonowens.
You are schoolteacher?
Yes, Your Majesty. But before l start
my work here, there is one point--
You are part of general plan l have
for bringing to Siam...
...what is good in Western culture.
Already l have bring printing press
here for printing.
-Yes, l know, Your Majesty.
-How you know?
Before l signed our agreement, l found
out about your ambitions for Siam.
How old shall you be?
You do not look like
scientific person for teaching.
How old shall you be?
l am 1 50 years old, Your Majesty.
ln what year were you borned?
ln 1 71 2, Your Majesty.
How many years shall you
have been married?
Several, Your Majesty.
How many grandchildren
shall you have by now?
How many, how many, how many?
You do not answer fast.
l make better question
than she make answer.
You are not afraid of king.
Not to be afraid is good thing
in scientific mind.
l think maybe...
...you make very good schoolteaching.
Come.
A few of my wives.
They have beauty
but not gift for knowledge.
l have no time for teaching,
being busy with foreign affairs...
...and other situations.
l may present Lady Thiang, head wife.
There is a happy land
Far, far away
Where saints in glory stand
Bright, bright as day
''ln the beginning, God created
the heaven and the Earth.''
Missionary.
Oh, a missionary taught you English.
Yes, sir. Missionary.
l have boy too.
Crown Prince Chowfa Chulalongkorn,
heir to throne.
You help Madam Leonowens with
schoolteaching...
...and she in turn shall teach you
the better English.
She is very grateful to me
for my kindness.
Lady Thiang, have children prepare for
presentation to schoolteacher.
Speaking of teaching, Your Majesty,
in our agreement--
Lady Son lKlin, Lady Talap, Lady Piam.
And this girl is present to me
from a Burma prince.
She just arrived.
Good day, madam.
My name is Tuptim.
l already speak English.
And very nicely too.
l think l have fine idea.
ln addition to children, you will also
teach those of my wives...
...as have sense enough for learning.
Siam to be very modern,
scientific country.
Everybody speaking the English.
Your Majesty, it is not in our
agreement that l teach your wives too.
Also, l will allow you to help me
in my foreign correspondence.
l shall be perfectly happy to
help you in any way l can...
...provided we can clear up this
one little matter of the house.
House?
House? What house?
My house, Your Majesty. The one
you promised me, adjoining the palace.
lt is our pleasure
that you shall live in palace.
You teach in palace,
and you shall live in palace.
Will have nice apartment.
Can look out, see many things.
Oh, yes, l'm sure we could
see many things...
...such as iron bars, guards at
the doors, et cetera, et cetera.
What is this ''et cetera''?
Well, it means ''and all the rest
and so forth,'' Your Majesty.
You will meet my children.
l'm sorry, Your Majesty, but if
there is to be no house...
...l shall have to get back
to the boat.
You will stand here
and meet royal children.
Very well, Your Majesty.
But there isn't much time.
The royal princes and princesses.
Well, well, well?
Schoolteacher has graciously changed
her mind and shall live in palace.
For the time being, Your Majesty.
These are the children you shall teach.
Someday shall allow you
to meet my others.
More, Your Majesty?
Children of wives
not in favor with king.
Sixty-seven, l think.
No! Oh, ladies, please.
Don't open that, no.
Oh, my goodness! Oh, won't you all
go back to your rooms?
Lady Thiang, will you please
ask them to leave?
l must have some privacy.
Good heavens!
What are they trying to do to me?
Sir, they think you wear dress like
that because you shaped like that.
Well, l most certainly am not.
They wish to know, sir,
if they may see the boy?
l'm sorry, Lady Thiang, he is asleep.
Please, do tell me.
Why do you keep calling me sir?
Because you scientific,
not lowly like woman.
But do you all think that women
are more lowly than men?
Well, l certainly do not.
Please, sir, do not tell king.
Make king angry.
Perhaps it's time somebody did
tell him a thing or two.
Mrs. Anna?
Please, you have some English books
l can read?
Yes, of course, my dear,
but they're not unpacked yet.
They laugh at her because
she is foolish child.
She has come to live in palace of king
and yet she is unhappy.
After all, she had no choice
in the matter.
Perhaps she is homesick.
ls not homesickness that make me sad,
Mrs. Anna.
ls love for one
l shall never see again.
Oh, poor child.
He is Lun Tha, who was chosen
to bring me here.
We tried so hard not to have
love for each other...
...but we could not help ourselves.
We did try, Mrs. Anna.
lt isn't easy to stop loving a man
if he's the man you want.
Even if you know
you will never see him again.
l know.
l was very much in love
with my husband.
Please ask them to put that down.
They wish to know, sir, who is man?
That was my husband, Tom.
Tom.
He was pretty in face.
Oh, dear, yes, he was.
Very pretty in face.
When I think of Tom
I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
And the soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill
I remember this
And I always will
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
Are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom...
...and me
Hello, young lovers
Whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you
Be brave, young lovers
And follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close...
...to each other tonight
I've been in love like you
I know how it feels
To have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street
On the chance that you'll meet
And you meet...
...not really by chance
Don't cry, young lovers
Whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my memories...
...are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own
Like yours
I've had a love...
...of my own
Be it pleasures and palaces
Though we may roam
Be it ever so humble
There's no place like home
A charm from the skies
Seems to hallow us there
-Father, l'll be late for school!
-You wait.
You are pleased to recite proverb
you learn yesterday...
...and writing down 1 2 times
in copybook.
''A thought for the day:
East or west...
...home is best.''
''East, west, home, best,''
means house!
''A man's house is only less dear
to him than his honor.''
Every day, month after week,
something about house.
Are my children to be taught
nothing more?
Yesterday we are taught...
...that the world is a round ball...
...which spins on an invisible stick
through its middle.
Everyone knows the world
rides on the back of a turtle...
...who keeps it
from running into the stars.
How can it be that everyone knows
one thing...
...if many people
believe another thing?
Then which is true?
The world is ball...
...with stick through it.
l believe.
You believe?
Does that mean that you do not know?
But you must know,
because you are king.
Good.
Someday you too will be king...
...and you too will know everything.
But how do l learn?
And when do l know
that l know everything?
When you are king.
When you are king.
But l do not know.
ln my head are many facts,
but l am not sure.
What to tell a growing son?
How to bring truth and justice
to my people?
When I was a boy
World was better spot
What was so was so
What was not was not
Now I am a man
World have change a lot
Some things nearly so
Others nearly not
There are times I almost think
I am not sure
Of what I absolutely know
Very often find confusion
In conclusion
I concluded long ago
In my head are many facts
That as a student
I have studied to procure
In my head are many facts
Of which I wish
I was more certain
I was sure
Is a puzzlement
Shall I join with other nations
In alliance?
If allies are weak
Am I not best alone?
If allies are strong with power
To protect me
Might they not protect me
Out of all I own?
Is a danger to be trusting
One another
One will seldom want to do
What other wishes
But unless someday
Somebody trust somebody
There'll be nothing left on earth
Excepting fishes
There are times I almost think
Nobody's sure of what
He absolutely know
Everybody find confusion
In conclusion
He concluded long ago
And it puzzle me to learn
That though a man may be in doubt
Of what he know
Very quickly will he fiight
He'll fiight to prove
That what he does not know
Is so
Sometimes I think
That people going mad
Sometimes I think
That people not so bad
But no matter what I think
I must go on living life
As leader of my kingdom
I must go forth
Be father to my children
And husband to each wife
Et cetera, et cetera
And so forth
If my lord in heaven
Buddha show the way
Every day I try to live
Another day
If my lord in heaven
Buddha show the way
Every day I do my best
For one more day
But...
...is a puzzlement!
Come along now, children.
Take your places, please.
Quickly now...
...and quietly.
Lady Thiang, will you
start the lesson, please?
Blue...
...is ocean.
Red...
...Siam.
Here is king of Siam.
ln right hand is weapon.
Show how he destroy...
...all who fight him.
Green...
...Burma.
Here is king of Burma.
No clothes mean...
...how poor is king of Burma.
Thank you, Lady Thiang.
l'll continue.
The map you have been looking at
is 25 years old...
...and today
we have a surprise for you.
A new map just arrived from England.
l do not see Siam.
The white is Siam.
Siam not so small.
Well, wait. Let me show you England.
See? lt is even smaller than Siam.
Before l came here, Siam was just
that little white spot to me.
Now that l've been here many months
it has become far more than that...
...because l've met the people of Siam,
and l'm learning to understand them.
You like us, Mrs. Anna?
Yes, l like you very much.
Very much, indeed.
It's a very ancient saying
But a true and honest thought
That if you become a teacher
By your pupils you'll be taught
As a teacher I've been learning
You'll forgive me if I boast
And I've now become an expert
On the subject I like most
Getting to know you.
Getting to know you
Getting to know all about you
Getting to like you
Getting to hope you like me
Getting to know you
Putting it my way
But nicely
You are precisely
My cup of tea
Getting to know you
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you
Getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the...
...beautiful and new things...
...I'm learning about you
Day by...
...day
Getting to know you
Getting to know all about you
Getting to like you
Getting to hope you like me
Getting to know you
Putting it my way
But nicely
You are precisely
My cup of tea
Getting to know you
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you
Getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the...
...beautiful and new things...
...I'm learning about you
Day by...
...day
Getting to know you
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you
Getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the...
...beautiful and new things...
...I'm learning about you
Day by...

Getting to know you
Getting to feel free and easy
When I am with you
Getting to know what to say
Haven't you noticed
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy
Because of all the...
...beautiful and new things...
...I'm learning about you
Day...

...day
Goodness, this started out
to be a geography lesson.
Quickly, let's get back to work.
-Now--
-What is that green up there?
That is Norway.
Nor...way.
Nor...way.
Norway is a very cold place.
Sometimes it is so cold...
...that the lakes and rivers freeze...
...and the water becomes so hard
that you can walk on it.
Walk on water?
Yes, walk on water.
How is it possible?
Hard water?
Not only that, but the raindrops
change into small white spots...
...that look like lace.
And this is called ''snow.''
Snow.
Spots of lace!
Yes, Your Highness. The water freezes
on its way down from the sky.
l do not believe such thing as snow.
And l do not believe
such thing as snow.
And l do not believe Siam is this big.
And other country so big.
-Siam is biggest country in world!
-Siam!
What, what, what?
How can schoolroom be so unscientific?
Well, Your Majesty, we had
a little misunderstanding.
l was trying to describe snow...
...and they refused to believe
there is such a thing.
Snow?
Snow.
From mountaintop.
From sky, Your Majesty.
From sky to mountaintop.
That's right, Your Majesty.
l remember. l see pictures
of Switzerland.
Land all white with snow.
Who does not believe this?
Well, after all,
they've never seen it.
Never seen?
lf they believe only what they see,
why do we have schoolroom? Rise!
Never let me hear
of not believing schoolteacher...
...whom l have bring here
at high expense.
Twenty pounds each month.
Twenty English pounds.
Sterling!
Rise!
l command all of you...
...to make most of this opportunity
for expensive education.
For sake of selves...
...and country.
Furthermore, it is--
What, what, what? This is not
study book l have provide.
No, Your Majesty, it's one of mine.
-l gave it to Tuptim.
-The name! You tell me!
ls called
The Small House of Uncle Thomas.
ls by American lady,
Harriet Beecher Stowe.
A woman has written a book?
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
A wonderful book, Your Majesty.
All about the evils
of slavery in America.
President Lincoln of America
against slavery, no?
Very definitely, Your Majesty.
Me too.
Slavery very bad thing.
Mr. Lincoln is fighting a war,
even now, to set the slaves free.
You admire him for this?
Very much, Your Majesty.
He seems to be a fine man
who has studied hard...
...and educated himself.
ln that, he is not unlike yourself.
Shall Mr. Lincoln be winning this war
he is fighting at present?
No one knows, really.
Does he have enough guns and
elephants for transporting same?
l don't think they have elephants
in America, Your Majesty.
-No elephants?
-No.
No wonder he's not winning war.
All right, children,
you may be seated now.
-Mrs. Anna?
-Yes, Your Highness?
l do not understand...
...how slaves can be set free
if their masters wish to keep them.
lt's done by the passing of a law...
...and by the enforcing of that law,
if necessary.
But my slaves...
...and the slaves of my father....
Suppose there was such a law in Siam
and we did not want it so?
Sometimes things can't be just a
question of what we want, Highness...
...but of what is right.
l think perhaps we had better call
recess until after luncheon.
You may be excused.
Young prince has healthy respect...
...for ways of his own people.
Sometimes more than king.
Prince Chulalongkorn is a fine boy
with a keen and probing mind.
But he still has much to learn,
Your Excellency.
What is important for him to learn...
...l do not think he'll find
in this classroom.
l'm fully aware that you do not
approve of my coming to Siam.
Why are you so blind?
Have you no eyes to see?
lKing tries impossible task...
...wishing to be scientific man
who learn all modern things.
l think it a fine ambition.
lnside him is strong king like
his father, who cannot change.
He will only tear himself in two,
trying to be something he can never be.
Of course he can never be...
...if those closest to him
are unwilling to help him.
You do not know king
as well as you think you do.
You believe you have
great influence over him.
You will end up as his slave
like all the others.
l....
Yes, yes. Just a moment.
The king?
At this hour of the night?
Well, l trust His Majesty won't object
if l put some clothes on first.
You sent for me, Your Majesty?
Your Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty is reading the Bible.
Mrs. Anna...
...l think your Moses
shall have been a fool.
Moses?
Moses, Moses, Moses.
l think he shall have been a fool.
Here it stands written by him...
...that the world was created
in six days.
Now you know and l know...
...that it took many ages
to create world.
l think he shall have been a fool
to have written so.
What is your opinion?
ls that why Your Majesty sent for me
at this hour of the night?
That is not reason, but first
l wish to discuss Moses.
Now, how am l ever to learn truth...
...if different English books
state different things?
The Bible was not written by men
of science, but by men of faith.
lt was their explanation
of the miracle of creation...
...which is the same miracle whether
it took six days or many centuries.
l still think your Moses
shall have been a fool.
As you wish, Your Majesty.
Now, was there something else?
Take letter.
A letter? Now?
Now. When else?
Now is always best time.
Take letter to Mr. Lincoln of America,
who is very scientific ruler.
Very well, Your Majesty.
From Phra Mana Mongut...
...by the blessing of the highest
super agency in the world...
...of the whole universe,
the king of Siam.
Sovereign of all tributary countries
adjacent and in every direction...
...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera....
Do you not have any respect for me?
Why do you stand over my head?
l cannot stand all the time.
And in this country no one's head
shall be higher than king's.
From now on in presence, you shall
so conduct like all other subjects.
You mean, on the floor?
All subjects do so.
l'm very sorry.
l shall try my best not to let my head
be higher than Your Majesty's...
...but l simply cannot
grovel on the floor.
l couldn't possibly
work that way, or think.
You are very difficult woman!
Perhaps so, Your Majesty.
But observe care that head
shall not be higher than mine.
When l shall sit, you shall sit!
When l shall kneel, you shall kneel.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!
Very well, Your Majesty.
ls promise?
ls promise.
Good.
To his Royal Presidency
of the United States in America...
...''Abrahom Lingkong''...
...et cetera. You fix up.
lt has occurred to us....
You see, it has occurred to us....
lt has occurred to us that if we
shall be sending you several pairs...
...of young male elephants...
...to be turned loose
in forests of America--
A-mer-i-ca.
We are of opinion...
...that after a while
they shall increase in number.
-And inhabitants of America shall--
-Your Majesty.
Well?
l don't think you mean pairs
of male elephants.
How can l make letter
if you interrupt?
And inhabitants of America shall be
able to catch and tame them...
...and use them as beasts of burden.
Only male elephants, Your Majesty?
You put in the details.
Good night.
Moses.
Lincoln!
Elephants!
Groveling on the floor
at 2:00 in the morning.
l am Lun Tha.
You are Mrs. Anna, schoolteacher?
Yes, but you shouldn't be--
l must meet with Tuptim again.
Please!
You have been seeing her here?
Twice we have spoken.
Each time it becomes more difficult.
She has said you will help us.
Oh, no, l couldn't!
lt's much too dangerous.
Not for me, but for Tuptim and you.
You'll be killed if they find you in
the City of Women. You must leave!
Death is not worse pain than
empty life. Please, Mrs. Anna.
l'm sorry, Lun Tha.
There's nothing l can do.
Wait there.
Tuptim.
Oh, Lun Tha.
Seeing you this way is not enough.
There is nothing we can do.
l am watched...
...too closely.
Must we go on forever
hiding our love like this?
We kiss in a shadow
We hide from the moon
Our meetings are few
And over too soon
We speak in a whisper
Afraid to be heard
When people are near
We speak not a word
Alone in our secret
Together we sigh
For one smiling day
To be free
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky
Behold and believe
What you see
Behold...
...how my lover...
...loves me
When will we be together, Tuptim?
When?
lt can never be, Lun Tha.
Not ever.
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky
Behold and believe
What you see
Behold...
...how my lover...
...loves me
You must go now.
l will be missed, and they will
start searching for me.
When l return, it will be
to take you from here.
There is no way, Lun Tha.
There is the river. There are boats.
l will find a way.
Oh, if it could only be.
lt will be.
l swear this.
When all is arranged,
l will get word to you.
l shall pray, Lun Tha.
lf you see a chaba flower in your
path, broken like this...
...it will be the sign that l
have come for you. Watch for it.
l will be ready.
Stop, stop, stop!
-Your Majesty.
-What, what, what?
Well?
When Siam's richest province
was stolen by France...
...l warned it was only
beginning of Western treachery.
lf enemies of ours,
with lies such as this...
...can convince British that you are
unfit to be ruler of Siam...
...our seas will soon be thick
with ships, greedy for conquest.
So it has finally come.
We must act quickly.
But how? Where?
l must think.
Clearly. Scientifically.
l must think.
But how can l think
while being driven out of mind!
A charm from the skies
Seems to hallow us there
Which, seek through the world
Is ne'er met with elsewhere
That was splendid. Very effective.
Now....
-Good morning.
-You think you teach king lesson!
This is one lesson you do not
be paid for teaching!
You will stop instructing wives
and children in ''Home Sweet House''...
...in order to remind me of breaking
promises l never make, et cetera.
Your Majesty, l do not intend to have
my boy brought up in a harem.
You did promise me a house. ''A
brick residence adjoining the palace.''
-Those were your very words.
-l do not remember such words!
-l remember them.
-l will do remembering!
Who is king here?
l remind you so you remember that.
l do not remember any promises.
l do not remember anything
except that you are my servant.
Oh, no, Your Majesty.
What, what, what?
l said, you are my servant!
No, Your Majesty, that is not true.
l am most certainly not your servant!
lf you do not give me
the house you promised...
