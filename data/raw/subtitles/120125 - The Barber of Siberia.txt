Company, to the waggons!
Forwards!
First division - first waggon.
You can't do it, this is 1st class.
- Which one?
- This one.
Then You should guard it.
Hey, cadets, do you want a roll?
- Here.
- I don't have the change.
Tolstoi!
Hurry!
Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, gentlemen!
1st class... Smells exotic.
- I bet, this is a free cabin.
- Gentlemen!
Hehe, the trouble has started.
Forwards, gentlemen!
Gentlemen! In here, quickly
Gentlemen, please return!
What's going...?
Damn, where are they?
Oh yes, I'd never want to 
marry her - that's for sure.
Why did she start singing?
- Who knows...
- From delight!
Actually, why did we leave?
Who left first?
I guess it was me, but 
You did the same then.
Nice joke!
We could travel 1. class now,
together with Tolstoi.
Excuse me... Captain!
Gentlemen, I think it's getting serious.
Oh yes.
Calm down - no need to panic.
We're not in a war.
- What has happened?
- Everything is all right.
You had to take care 
of Your keys better!
Pardon.
Cadet Tolstoi...
What?!
- Get up!
- Forwards!
Quickly!
Excuse us, Madam. Welcome to Russia.
Our boys are coming from 
the shooting range.
Very good.
Attention!
Put it up!
Greetings, cadets!
Greetings, Your Excellence!
Lead the cadets back home!
What is the general doing here?
He just wanted to see your drunken face.
Anna Karenina made Tolstoi drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I'm happy.
To the left!
Forwards, singing!
Shut up!
Move off the street, make 
room for His Excellency!
- An attentat on the senator!
- Hand out the ammunition!
Spread out! Keep attention on 
entrances and rooftops!
Let's move quickly!
Stay here and cover us.
After me! There they are!
Alibekow, Buturlin, to the inner yard!
No, hands up!
- Don't shoot, please.
- What?
I won't do it again.
Why did you do it then?
Please...
Thank You.
All of them were captured!
One was on the roof....
Andrej... all!?
What's the matter?
We have to go!
They come!
Come to us...
Sweeties...
Come to our ball!
Ladies, let's better repeat 
the conjugations.
- What's happened, cadets?
- Attention! Division, turn around!
Forwards!
Hold yourself upright, gentlemen!
Count the pairs up and take position!
The "1"'s are ladies
and "2"'s are the gentlemen.
I want to see some good 
manners, gentlemen!
Right and left!
Put down the chairs!
Turn around!
Let's start the exercise:
gentlemen with the ladies now.
Change!
Tolstoi drank champagne 
with Anna Karenina,
and now we all have to mark the stork.
That's enough! It has nothing 
to do with the champagne.
Anyways, I did carry You,
when You were drunk.
- When?
- This year?!
Ohh, yes.
Change the legs!
Thanks.
Let her through.
Thank You.
Anna Karenina!
Hello.
Stop it! One step back!
Rifle down!
That's not an academy, more like a zoo.
Being a stork before, now we're crabs...
What kind of wax is it? 
It stinks: "Surprise",
especially for the big ball.
Wax "Surprise" guarantees 
You a funny evening."
- We had a funny morning already.
- That's right.
- Your Highness, there's a lady for You.
- A lady? Who is she??
A foreign lady.
She may enter.
An english dictionary, quickly!
- Easy down there!
- Excuse me.
What is going on here?
Your Highness, the "stork"commando
is almost finished with polishing.
- O God, she came because of her fan.
- What's going on here?
We're making the hall ready 
for the big ball.
You had the order to polish the "floor".
- But we already have got...
- Keep polishing the floor!
Yes, Sir!
Here!
A call for You...
May I go?
May I go?
Tell the countess, the 
ball will take place.
As usual.
Did You find, what I asked for?
As usual!
General is coming!
The general! He's coming!
The general!
What's going on, gentlemen?
The punished "stork"commando 
is polishing the floor.
- Oh yes, continue.
- Yes, Sir!
- Your Excellency, I found him.
- Whom?
Alexander the Great.
Fool!
Mother... Is something wrong with You?
Andrej... Why is he here?
Something must have happened!
- I awaited it already!
- Hello, Uncle Nikolaj.
Nothing happened, I am only 
comin' by for a minute.
- I'm sure, something happened!
- No. Can I speak to You alone?
Why, we don't have secrets in front of...
Where did he go? Oh, yes...
Tell it to me quickly, because I 
have to catch a train to Warsawa,
to play Lady Macbeth there, but I'm 
sure, it doesn't interest you at all.
Oh yes, mother, it does pretty much.
I only need some money, only 3 rubles.
Where's my cape? I'll need it...
There it is.
So, you're telling me that you 
need 3 rubles? Only 3 rubles?
Like I already said, Nikolaj...
- Tea?
- For whom? We had tea already.
...that the young people today...
Ohh, my nails...
Young people today are...
Where is my cigarette?
They are so...
You've got matches, so 
you smoke actually!
- But of course....
- No, I don't!
Tell me, Andrej... Tell 
me, dear friend:
Did you ever thhink about,
how difficult my life is?
I need only 3 rubles, Mama.
I sacrificed my career because 
of this person...
- I refused so many...
- Mother, have a nice trip!
Where is the stuff I take
when I feel bad?
So I refused it...
Andrej, I'd like to...
No one is here, I'm speaking to no one!
No "hello", no "good bye"...
I think, this would be more effective.
3 rubles, and she started...
- And Nikolaj too...
- Here. Take it.
- What?!
- They're only 3 rubles.
You can pay it back later.
Take it.
Thank you, Dunjascha.
I broke something and need 
to repair it quickly.
I'll pay you back - I promise.
- Your shoelace...
- Thank you, Maschenka.
"Surprise"...
Why didn't they write it in russian.
This was done on purpose.
Let the orchestra play then.
It's so strange, and if You'll 
think about the dancing...
- It's too dangerous, Your Excellency.
- Do something!
Why don't you play anything?
Maestro, somebody has stolen 
our colophonium.
- Send somebody to get some more.
- Already happened...
How long yet, gentlemen?
Kitty, come here little doggy.
She gives a great brush.
Put on more, I'm heavy!
My father always had it, 
when he was hunting.
Never slipped out the saddle.
Kitty, serve your country.
Quickly, give the dog to me.
- She smells perfumed.
- Ready?
Tolstoi, Anna Karenina is freezing 
waiting for you to dance with.
Buturlin, stop the sniffing,
real girls are upstairs.
- Tolstoi, what's up with You?
- And with You?
Cadets... Position!
Left.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen... For me too!
- Ready?
- Yes, Your Excellency!
Young ladies... one!
One, two!
Turn around... one!
One, two!
Please, go quickly in pairs...
Yes, say it later...
- Ladies...!
- Next time we'll meet longer!
The ladies are going to bed.
Good bye.
So, gentlemen, I went over to proceed 
deepening my research about the
progressive corset fashion
- and notice: she doesn't wear one!
- Really?
And even more: I haven't 
found any corsage either!
But later I discovered a little mole
underneath the left shoulder blade.
Tolstoi?!
Do You know something about...
this mole?
Weren't You exploring it during 
the train journey?
That seems so...
But really!?
And?
What's "arch"?
I can't keep telling lookin at this face. 
I'll continue, after Tolstoi fall asleep.
Sir! Cadet Tolstoi reports back!
Nothing particular to tell.
- You can go!
- Yes, Sir!
Cadet Poljewski reports back
without any incidents.
- Brought the girls back?
- Yes.
- Proceed.
- Yes, Sir.
Andrej, I hope, You did 
not get too angry?
I don't have your title and rank, but 
to talk about a woman like You did 
about Miss Callaghan is inacceptable!
Andrej... Really, what bad 
things did I say?
You could make jokes about
Your "Thumbelina" as well...
Count! It was an honor!
- Tolstoi, are You serious?
- Absolutely.
- He's coming!
- 1, 2, 3...
There he comes... quickly!
Cadets!
Good morning, Your Honor!
Cadets!
Cadets!
It wasn't me.
Cadet Tolstoi...
Here!
Count, You're infamous.
I'm ready for You.
Oh, well... There are two old cannons 
outside: let's fight with those.
Tolstoi, we're meeting in one hour!
- Maybe we can blow up the academy.
- I'm not kidding.
Do You understand, what will happen,
if superiors will find out?
By dawn in the gym.
You choose the weapons.
- I leave it up to You.
- Sabres.
Tolstoi, don't risk, I 
fence better then You.
We'll find out tomorrow. 4 o'clock 
in the morning, in the gym. Sabres!
- It was an honor!
- Same here. Don't sleep too long!
Hey, Tolstoi, put the leg down.
Relax a little.
I won't tell anybody.
If You don't want it - I 
can't force You.
Change!
These silly kids...
Not a duel...
God beware.
That's the end. All will 
walk to the trial.
That sounds like sabres - 
I came to You right away.
A duel maybe...
Oh my God!
All to the military trial?
O my God, if the monarch finds out...
If he finds out, we're all doomed then.
You in the first place...
Do You hear that?
What's going on, captain?
I'm improving my fencing skills.
Don't have any time during the day.
- Pawel Timofeewitsch...
- Nikolaj Karlowitsch...
Fool! Continue, please!
You'll even wake the czar 
up, idiot!
- You, Mokin...
- I work on my skills.
What a disaster...
- Your honor...
- You...
- It's my fault...
- It was me, Your Honor.
Keep quiet, you whippersnappers!
My mother won't stand it at all!
You won't die because of it, Tolstoi.
Remove the bloody stuff.
How is his Arm? 
Follow me!
You idiots! Want to move to a court?
To be degraded for 10 years,
like it happened to me?
Thank God and remember:
there was no duel!
An accident, a bet, a test 
for "Figaro", a joke...
- But no duel! Is it clear!
- Yes...
- Go to bed!
- And the sabres?
Give them to me, foolish musketeers!
What will happen now?...
Kuzma, move to the fair!
Oh no, I'm too late!
Ehh, nice... Nice one!
- Red caviar or black?
- Both, please.
Nice!
- Got some?
- Yeah!
- And, great?
- Great!
Smirnoff, full.
Again.
More.
I have the honor, to inform 
Your Excellency, that
I want to leave the military academy,
without finishing the training.
What do You think?!
Write down!
I won't write anything like that.
It was a honor!
- All right...
- How dare are You...
I can write it myself.
We, the Tolstois... never
reject our decisions.
Cadets...!
Excuse me, young lady.
Did you see Poljewski?
- Forget Poljewski. Look at him!
- He's on a booze again. On a booze!
Booze!
Booze or not... Fools.
He's going inebriate!
Cadets! Wait a minute!
Please...
Ah, cadets...
Get lost!
Oh my God, he drank...
Does he have his cap this way?
Potemkin, now you're mine.
Oh no, Your Highness.
The war isn't over yet.
Oh, this barbaric nation!
Uneducated pack.
- Officer! Injure captive Potemkin...
- Napoleon?
...and kill him later!
So, so...
Napoleon is back from the 
island to the ice!
I'll bring him to the czar alive!
Wait, Your Excellency...
Put on Your cap.
- Go away!
- I've got a contract!
What contract! Come with 
me - I'll pay you!
Aim!
Fire!
Fire!
Load the cannon! Fire!
Napoleon... I'll get you!
Fire!
Let me through! Sorry...
Fire!
"Eastern week"
I caugt him! Napoleon in person!
Your Excellency... 
I bring You something.
What... What did you bring?
Happy feast. Forgive me 
in the name of Christ.
What for?
It's the sunday of forgiveness.
God will forgive you.
And my sins as well...
Who are you?
Who I am? Napoleon!
Don't You know?
Where am I?
In Russia, Your Excellency.
Good morning and happy feast then.
Happy feast.
God forgive my poor soul...
- May the angels stay with You during the meal.
- Thanks.
