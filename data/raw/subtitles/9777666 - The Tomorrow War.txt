Look, I’m incredibly proud
of my career in the military,
and I did two combat tours,
but, uh, I was never
gonna be a career guy.
I found my passion
in the Army Research Lab.
I used my GI Bill to, uh...
to go to Cal State,
and I’m currently teaching
high school biology.
Okay, Dan. I-I think
Arthur’s still reviewing
the proposal.
That’s great,
but I have some more data,
and I’m nearby,
so I-I want to bring
- a new proposal tonight.
- Let me put you on hold.
Muri? Muri!
Okay, none of you are my child.
Has anyone seen Muri?
- Coming!
- Grab these. I have a mission.
Get those to the kitchen.
- Yes, sir.
- There you are. March.
- Great party, Dan.
- Oh, thank you. I appreciate...
- Your place smells amazing.
- Thank you.
Things are heating up
in this final match
of the World Cup.
Hey, Forester.
-Sorry, guys. Gonna steal him
for a second. -Hey. Sorry, guys.
We are out of Christmas napkins.
Okay, we have
"I’m just here for the booze"
or "Happy 70th birthday."
- Go "Happy 70th."
- Yeah.
Babe, I’m on hold right now.
They’re trying
to track down Arthur.
- Right now?
- This is happening right now.
I am gonna punch you
in your unfortunately
very handsome face.
This is the call, though.
I’m in the final round.
This is real work
in an actual lab.
It’s my dream.
Well, Muri’s dream is that
you wa... - Hee-haw!
- that you watch the game
with her. -Oh, hi.
Hee-haw!
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
I promise I’ll be back
before the end of the game.
- Okay?
- All right.
- What’s this?
- Um, that’s...
Your-your dad sent Muri
a Christmas card.
- Can we talk about it tomorrow?
- Hmm.
Babe, we’ll talk about it.
Daniel. What?
We don’t have to talk.
He’s just trying to be
a grandpa.
Well, I think he forfeited
the right to meet
his granddaughter
when he abandoned your husband.
Hey.
No one’s eating my tuna Santa.
When I come back,
I’m gonna have a new job,
and I’m gonna eat all of
your tuna Santa. -
- Hey, Dan.
- Bye.
- Arthur. Hey, man.
- I’m glad you called.
It’s a very competitive
position.
- Yes, sir.
- And experience is everything.
Well, I have
leadership experience.
I ran combat missions in Iraq.
Does that translate, though?
It sure comes in handy
teaching high school.
Listen.
You’re a great candidate.
The only thing you’re missing is
private sector experience.
Which we have to say is
an important part
of what we’re looking for.
No, guys, guys...
And that’s why we had
to make a tough choice.
We found someone else.
His background and education...
He’s just a better fit for us.
Sorry, Dan.
Good luck.
Yeah.
Of course you’re not the guy.
You are such an idiot.
Sorry.
What happened?
We are live in Qatar
for the first World Cup
held in...
You know who Selman Waksman is?
I do.
He discovered the vaccine
for tuberculosis.
Really?
Do you know where he found it?
You tell me.
In the dirt with worms and poop.
The extreme heat
of our host city
makes playing in the summertime
all but impossible.
See these people...
playing soccer up there?
They are the best in the world.
Can you believe that?
- I want to be the best.
- Yeah?
Like you are at science.
Like I am at science.
You know what it takes
to be the best.
You got to say to yourself,
"I will do...
I-I will do..."
You have to think this.
"what nobody else
is willing to do."
Yeah. Right?
Mm-hmm.
I am meant to do
something special with my life.
Everything’s gonna be okay, Dad.
Thank you, honey.
That’s very sweet of you.
Although I’m pretty sure
it’s supposed to be me
telling you that
and not the other way around.
And here’s the corner kick.
This could be it. It’s coming...
And it’s knocked away
by the goalie.
Oh, and it’s a bicycle kick!
- Dad, watch.
- Wait a minute!
He’s heading down the pitch.
He’s alone,
only one defender behind him.
He’s driving towards it.
It’s unbelievable!
Can he do it? Yes, he can!
50 to 60 armed men and women
standing on the pitch.
- You’re tapped in.
- Good copy.
It’s okay.
We are you,
30 years in the future.
It’s okay, sweetie.
We are fighting a war.
Our enemy is not human.
And we are losing.
In 11 months’ time,
all human beings in the future
will be wiped
from the face of the earth
unless you help us.
We need you.
Our fathers, mothers
and grandparents,
we need you to fight beside us
if we stand a chance
at winning this war.
Is this a joke?
You...
are our last hope.
12 months ago, we had no idea
how those words
would change everything
about our daily lives.
Immediately, jump facilities
were established
around the globe
to send the world’s military
into the future
and help fight the Whitespikes.
The first thousand
soldiers are headed
- 28 years into the future.
- Five, four, three...
-We’ll be anxiously awaiting
their return. -...two, one.
Seven days later,
those hopes were dashed
as only a handful
of troops survived.
Since only 50% of the military
are qualified to jump,
civilians were needed
to support the war effort,
so the world’s leaders agreed
to institute the first
worldwide draft.
Yesterday, they were civilians.
- We are you.
- But today, they are soldiers.
But even with
thousands of civilian soldiers
being sent a week,
the future global population
is currently estimated
to be less than 500,000.
And with a draftee survival rate
of less than 20%,
many people are asking:
is it worth it?
The antiwar movement continues
to gain momentum.
There are riots and protests
happening all over the world.
What are we supposed to do?
Just throw up our hands, say,
"Sorry you’re dying"?
But why should we still
be fighting a war that,
as far as we’re concerned,
hasn’t even happened?
These are our children
and our grandchildren
that are dying.
We can’t just stand by
and allow them
to be wiped off
the face of the earth.
That’s why we need to draft
more civilians.
We need people to fight,
but we also need people
to solve the problem.
We need to do everything we can
to stop the aliens now.
This may be our last chance
to save the human race.
Please don’t let them draft you.
Please don’t let them take you.
I think you had
a bad dream, honey.
Don’t let them
take you. Please don’t...
It’s okay. Just breathe.
It’s okay.
Just breathe. Deep breaths.
Right, Daddy?
Yeah. In...
Out.
Yeah. Yeah.
Breathing brings what
- into your bloodstream?
- Oxygen.
Oxygen. Very good.
You need oxygen.
Oxygen feeds your...?
Brain.
- To your brain.
- It’s too easy.
It’s too easy?
All right.
The process of respiration
turns oxygen into what?
Um, carbon dioxide.
What’s carbon dioxide
also called?
CO2.
Okay. Maybe you need...
Maybe you need
a physical challenge.
How about this?
Why don’t you try to squeeze me
as hard as you can?
See if you can hurt me.
Mm.
No, no, not hard...
not-not that hard.
If you open your books
to page 47,
talking about photosynthesis
and the magic of chlorophyll.
It’s, uh...
It’s really interesting stuff,
guys. It’s kind of...
They say magic, you know,
it’s not like pulling
a rabbit out of a hat,
but it’s magic,
if you think about it.
The stuff we breathe out,
a tree breathes in?
I know, you guys are speechless
’cause it’s...
it’s so captivating.
All right, well...
you want to talk
about something else,
let’s talk about something else.
What gets you excited?
Anybody.
What do you want to talk about?
Anyone?
Really? Anyone.
Anyone in the class
besides Martin?
Class, what does Martin want
to talk about?
Ancient volcanoes.
Ancient volcanoes.
Volcanoes are
nature’s fury, guys.
Yes, which you demonstrated
graphically
at the last science fair.
What’s the point?
- What’s the point of what?
- Anything.
School, grades, college...
It’s all bullshit.
Yeah. We’ve seen
the new number projections.
We lose, period.
The aliens kill us all.
Those are numbers
from the year 2051.
- That’s 30 years from now.
- So?
They’re taking thousands
of people every week.
My uncle, Tina’s mom.
They’re gone, man.
Listen, guys.
I know it seems pretty bad.
But if there’s one thing
that the world needs right now,
it’s scientists.
We cannot stop innovating.
That’s how you solve a problem.
Science is important.
So we need to focus up.
Not our war! Not our war!
- James Daniel Forester Junior.
- Yes.
You go by James or Jim?
I go by Dan, middle name.
- Birth certificate, passport?
- Yeah.
Uh, the...
it should be in there.
Uh, as-as well as
my employment contract.
Can you have a seat, please?
- Just, uh, over there.
- Sure.
Thank you.
Remove your shirt, please.
- Remove my shirt?
- Mm.
Hey, what is this for?
It’s just a test.
Little extra tight, probably,
but that’s fine.
Oh, a seat belt. Okay.
Oh, is it a driving test?
It is not.
No? You don’t have jokes
in the future?
Do you have any children,
Mr. Forester?
- Look up.
- I have a daughter.
I don’t see
her birth certificate.
- It’s not there?
- No.
You... I’m not... didn’t...
I didn’t know you needed
her birth certificate.
It’s not required.
However, if you are
- to die in action...
- Arms straight.
Your dependents will receive
a pretax payment of $1 million.
I’d assume you’d want us
to verify exactly
who your family is.
Yeah. Well, hold on
a second here.
You’re gonna feel
a cold sensation.
What is this test?
What are you testing?
What are you whispering?
Mr. Forester...
you’ve been elevated
to Active-2 status.
What?
You meet all requirements
for conscription.
Wh-What... what are the
requirements for conscription?
A pulse?
It says, at 11:23 Eastern Time,
October 13, 2030,
you’ll be pronounced dead.
It-it says that I die
in seven years?
- Bite down.
- How do I die?
-We can’t share that
information, sir. -But you know?
You’ll really want
to bite down on this
if you want to keep
from severing your tongue.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
One more, one more...
Can you please comply
and bite down, sir?
Get your hand out of my face,
or I’ll bite your finger off.
Hold on a second.
Can we just slow this down
for just a second?
H-Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Can we just slow down
one second? I...
This device facilitates your
jump to and from the future war.
It is synched
to your unique biosignature
and can only be removed when
your tour of duty is complete.
The Jump-band allows us
to track you anywhere on Earth.
Any attempt to evade the draft
or tamper with the device
will result in your imprisonment
or your spouse
or dependent of legal age
taking your place.
You have 24 hours to get
your personal affairs in order
and report for basic training.
Do you have any questions?
You’re free to go.
I see you were a squad leader
in the Army Special Ops Command?
In Iraq?
Yeah, 15 years ago.
Thank you for your service.
Again.
Who wants to tell me
what they remember?
About your seven days.
Anyone?
Terry.
You want to tell us anything
you remember?
The clicking.
God, I still can’t get the sound
out of my head.
One starts it, and then
the rest just chime in.
That’s when you realize...
they’re never gonna stop.
Not until we’re all dead.
Do you know how many
of these guys come back?
30%... 30% of draftees return.
I talk to them every day,
and they suffer
so much post-trauma
they can barely talk.
I mean, I-I can see why
you don’t work
in the recruiting department.
We’re gonna run.
Come here.
We’re gonna run.
This is what we’re doing.
You, me and Muri,
we have to run.
We have 24 hours. I don’t know
how to run from the government.
You know someone who does.
No.
We have to. Dan.
I’m not asking him
for a goddamn thing.
Do not ask for yourself.
Ask for me. Ask for me, Dan.
Ask for Muri.
Hello?
What, are you gonna shoot me?
I didn’t recognize you.
Must’ve been that metrosexual
scruffle you got there.
I mean, grow a beard or don’t.
Oh, it’s my beard?
That’s the reason
you don’t recognize me?
- You got a new accessory, huh?
- You, too.
Desert Eagle .50 cal.
That’s cool.
Yeah, it does the job.
The job of convincing the world
you have a small dick?
- Oh, what’s this?
- You like that?
That’s like the big-boy version
of that windup toy
- you drove in.
- That yours?
Yep. Got a Bullitt Mustang
parked around back, too.
Before your time, I guess.
Let me see it.
C-Series.
Second generation.
That’s sensor-calibrated
to your pulse.
Fortunately...
you came to the only guy for
whom this is a piece of cake.
I wish you wouldn’t drink
while you do this.
I wish Stevie Nicks would
show up in her birthday suit
with a jar of pickles
and a bottle of baby oil.
What?
Yeah, don’t-don’t overthink it.
So, what made you come to me?
I get a good Yelp review?
Come on.
I know what you do here.
You have a master’s degree
in engineering
and a general disdain
for the U.S. government,
not to mention
no visible means of income.
What do you mean?
I fix planes for this rich guy.
He’s got a C-130 out there.
Yeah, I’m sure that’s
how you can afford a Jeep
and that Desert Eagle,
high roller.
Are you checking to see
if I’m wearing a wire?
Yeah.
The thought occurred to me.
Oh.
You come here, surprise visit,
talking about my distrust
of the federal government
and my "no visible means
of income."
Yeah, that sounds
like entrapment.
Is that entrapment?
Is that what that sounds like,
Perry Mason?
Is that ’cause you binge-watch
The Sopranos in your trailer?
You think I’m gonna
get out of the draft
if I give the government you?
There’s gonna be... some Feds are
gonna come out of your Jeep.
Did you catch that, guys?
Send in Stevie Nicks.
Why else would you come here?
Huh?
You never wanted my help
a day in your life.
What did you just say to me?
There were years...
decades...
That was all
we wanted from you,
was a little bit of help.
I could’ve used help...
burying your wife.
Let me tell you something.
You have no idea what went on
between your mother and me.
When I got back from Nam,
I was in a very...
dark place.
And I...
I couldn’t find a way out.
I couldn’t get away
from my anger and my violence.
I couldn’t control myself.
I couldn’t even
recognize myself.
But I knew I was...
dangerous.
You’ve been mad at me
your whole life
’cause I left you,
but I’m telling you,
it would’ve been worse
for you and your mom
if I’d have stayed.
No.
You didn’t leave for us.
You quit,
because you’re a coward.
And you still are.
Stop sending Christmas cards
to my house.
You’re never gonna know Muri.
You don’t get a second chance.
Allowed to take $400
out at once from the ATM,
but if we get out of town...
What? Hi.
You okay?
I don’t know what’s gonna
happen to me if I go,
but you and I both know
what will happen to all of us
if I stay.
We’ll figure it out together.
I know how to do this.
It’s seven days. I’ll survive.
I’m a pretty tough guy.
You’re tough? The man who cries
through every cold?
Yeah.
You have to tell her.
What you doing?
Looking for vaccines.
Oh. You find any?
Not really.
Digging’s hard.
Oh, see, it’s about, uh...
You’re doing the...
It’s right what you’re doing
with your foot...
You got to give it the weight...
But then you got to use...
What’s this?
- Leverage.
- Leverage.
Son of a bitch.
- You did that.
- Oh, hey. Shit.
That’s supposed to be buried
deeper than that.
I’ll give you ten dollars
if you tell your mom
that you cut that cable, not me.
- 20.
- 20?
All right.
Fist-bump on it.
There you go.
So, uh...
So, listen, Chickpea.
I got to go on a trip.
Be gone for about a week.
You got drafted.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
It’s okay.
Don’t worry.
I want you to know something.
I will be back.
Okay.
You know I love you, Chickpea.
You people...
you all have something
in common.
Whatever your age, occupation,
ethnicity or gender,
whatever your background,
you are now heroes.
You answered a call.
It was a cry for help
across time.
It’s the voice
of your children...
and they need you.
The sacrifice that you make now
is for them.
For the first time
in human history,
the armed forces
from every nation
are united against one enemy.
I’m Sergeant Diaz.
I am not your friend.
This is.
Seven days from now,
when you are sent
- into that war...
- Wrap it around tighter.
You won’t be fighting
for your country.
Open the chamber, please.
You’ll be fighting
for the world.
I need to see
your weapon’s been cleared.
Throats and abdomens...
That’s what you aim for.
On behalf of
the Department of Defense...
and a grateful nation...
we thank you for your service.
Lieutenant Hart.
Your tour of duty
will be seven days.
That’s 168 hours.
At the end of your tour,
if the Jump-band attached
to your arm determines
that you are still
clinically alive...
Are there any doctors?
You will automatically
be jumped back
from wherever you are,
and your tour of duty
will be complete.
What you think you know about
basic training does not apply.
You will not march,
crawl or climb.
There will be no push-ups,
no pull-ups,
no obstacle courses.
I was kind of
looking forward to that.
You will take
what you are given
and dress as quickly as you can.
Overly ventilated jeans,
yoga pant fails,
cargo shorts...
All will be replaced.
See, I don’t get
the criteria for,
like, what goes and what stays.
Like, they took my shorts,
they left the jacket,
which is clearly, like,
fashion over function.
My man over there is wearing
a chef’s hat.
I mean, I didn’t get this...
This isn’t military issue.
I bought this at
Ross Dress for Less for like $30
’cause I thought it was
gonna be cold in the van.
Most of you will deploy
with D-Force.
The rest will jump with R-Force.
The screen on your Jump-band
indicates deployment.
Check it now.
Oh. I guess we’re together.
I’m Charlie.
Dan.
- How are you?
- Hey. R-Force.
You can braid
each other’s hair later.
All right, stop talking.
Listen.
Totally. Uh, sorry.
I-I mean, when I’m nervous,
I talk, and...
On a scale of one to ten,
I’m like a 97
on the nervous scale.
Or maybe a... like a 98.
You look like a murderer.
No offense. Well...
- I mean, you do, so...
- Hey.
-Hmm? -He will kill you
before the aliens do.
I know.
I called him a murderer.
- T-Turn around, man.
- I am.
Does anyone have any questions?
I missed all of that.
You know that guy
in the red shirt?
His name’s Dorian.
He’s one of the sole survivors
of the first jump to Russia.
This is his third tour.
What?
Yeah. You see that claw
around his neck?
That is supposed to be from
one of the first Whitespikes
ever killed.
He’s flipping us off.
I think she’s flipping you off.
She? Oh.
- That’s my bad.
- What’d you do before all this?
Well, I was department chair
at Georgia Tech.
Doctorate in Earth
and Atmospheric Sciences.
Now I’m director of R and D
at Wallace Technology.
We’re the fastest-growing
geothermal energy company
in the U.S.
Oh, wow.
Okay, so I have, like, a theory.
Mm-hmm.
Have you noticed how all of us...
Or at least most of us...
Are, like, over 40?
Yeah. You’re thinking that,
in order for the time jump
to occur,
we have to be dead in the time
we’re jumping to?
I mean, I imagine it’s to...
to avoid some sort of paradox.
Which would lead me to believe
that’s why the people
training us are so young.
They haven’t been born yet.
I think we’re
gonna be best friends.
Welcome to R-Force,
also known as Research Force.
You’ll be joining
your counterparts in 2051
at a fortified
research facility.
Your function is to add
your knowledge
and skill set to theirs
- and prevent our extinction.
- Excuse me.
Why don’t we just jump back
to earlier in the war?
The Jumplink doesn’t
work that way.
Jumplink?
It’s the temporal
displacement device
housed in a fortified location
in the middle of the ocean,
and it’s what makes
all your armbands work.
Time only flows
in one direction.
It’s like a river.
The Jumplink placed two rafts
on that river, 30 years apart.
Now, we can jump
back and forth between them,
but both rafts will always
keep moving forward.
So, why can’t we just build
more rafts?
The Jumplink tech
is held together
with chewing gum
and chicken wire.
We’ve barely managed to make
one very rudimentary wormhole.
If we weren’t in
an extinction-level event,
we’d still be jumping lab rats.
Now, we can jump you to 2051,
and we can jump you back.
Period.
Every six days,
the Whitespikes disappear.
They crawl back
into their nests.
We call it the Sabbath.
Their day of rest.
And that’s when
we insert troops.
Okay, but why don’t we have
pictures or video?
You know, it would help us
to know what we’re up against.
The consensus was that
if the public saw
what they’d face
when they reach the future,
it would become virtually
impossible to fill that hangar.
Okay, cool.
Next time someone asks that,
you should probably just lie.
Oh, come on, man.
Palms together.
Take a breath in.
And then exhale.
Bring your hands
through that center.
Close your eyes.
Small breath in and out.
I mean, out of all this stuff,
you couldn’t put one thing
of floss in here?
What’s up, man?
- You doing all right?
- Oh, no, yeah.
No, I’m-I’m good.
Going to war.
But you survived jellyfish
season, so you can survive this.
- The shirt.
- Shirt.
You know, actually, I didn’t.
My wife got this for me
as a joke
’cause I got stung
so many times.
I... I hate...
I hate the beach.
I hate it.
My wife, of course,
she loves it.
We went this summer
right before she...
She, uh... she got sent out
in the first wave.
I’m really sorry.
Yeah.
Uh, how about you, man?
You got a family?
All right, people!
Let’s go! This is not a drill!
Move your bodies! Let’s go!
This is not a drill!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let’s go! Let’s go!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What’s going on?
I thought we had seven days.
The world doesn’t end
on a schedule.
Uh, well, we’re not ready
for any kind of deployment.
We don’t even know
what we’re going on to do.
You’ll get your assignment
in the LZ.
Stay on comms. You’ll be
contacted as soon as you land.
Some of these guys are very
green. Do they all need to go?
Why can’t some of them stay here
and train some more?
The research facility
is under attack.
It’s the last lab left
studying the Whitespikes.
If it’s lost, the war is lost.
Reach out in space! Let’s go!
Commencing countdown protocol.
One minute to jump.
Be prepared for a drop.
The Jumplink will drop you five
to ten feet above the ground.
That should be fun.
30 seconds.
Weapons up.
Oh, here. Come on.
Take that, and just
flip it around like that.
Makes sense.
And that’s your safety.
Okay. How do you know how to do
all this stuff, man?
How are you so calm?
Long story.
What, are you, like,
ex-military?
Yeah.
Kind of a short story, I guess.
20 seconds.
Tuck position.
Where are we going?
Miami Beach.
Of course
it’d have to be a beach.
Ten, nine,
eight, seven,
six, five,
four, three,
two, one.
Launch.
Lieutenant, something’s wrong
with the output coordinates.
Should we abort?
Dan! Dan!
I got you. Come on.
You got to get up. I got you.
Welcome to Miami.
I’m just glad Will Smith
isn’t alive to see this.
Well, I could’ve done
without seeing that.
Well, if you think this is bad,
you don’t want to see
what happens next.
Where are they?
Somebody find out
what the hell went wrong.
Romeo Actual,
this is Romeo Command.
Do you copy me?
Can anybody hear me?
We need the comms up now.
Come on.
Get me someone on this radio
right now.
Romeo Actual,
this is Romeo Command.
Do you copy?
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah. Command, this is Actual.
We’re here.
Some of us.
Identify yourself.
I’m-I’m Dan Forester.
Dan Forester.
Okay, Dan, listen up.
I got imagery up of your team,
and I see that you’re a soldier,
so I’m gonna be real with you.
Whitespikes have
overrun the city,
and we can’t stop them,
so we’re gonna have to clean it.
Clean it?
A blanket bombardment
has been ordered.
Get me an ETA on that right now.
- On me.
- They’re going to eradicate
every living thing
till there is nothing left.
Wait.
They’re gonna do that to here?
I got one problem, Dan,
and I’m gonna need your help.
Get me that map
of the lab... now.
My research team is stranded
in a lab by your location,
and they are surrounded
by the enemy,
so you and your unit are now
on a rescue mission.
And since you have experience
running CSAR,
I need you to get my team
out of there.
You got it, Dan?
Copy that, Command.
Listen, everybody.
We’re on a CSAR, all right?
It’s combat search and rescue.
Our destination is
this research facility.
I need every able-bodied person
on this rooftop to follow me!
Okay.
We need someone on point.
What’s your name?
- Norah.
- Norah?
- What’s your name?
- Norah.
- Robert Cowan.
- Cowan. Okay.
You guys hustle up there,
look down the street,
tell me what you see.
- Okay? Go.
- Okay.
All right,
guys, what are we looking at?
Car on fire.
A scooter.
- No aliens.
- Copy that.
Let’s move.
Romeo Command,
we have multiple KIA.
Is there anyone left here alive?
Only the research team, I hope.
Everybody else was ordered
to evacuate.
Guys, situational awareness.
Eyes up, down, all around.
You’re wasting your time
training them to be soldiers.
I’m not. Just trying
to keep them alive, man.
Listen, you and your team seem
to be the only people out here
who know what the hell
they’re doing.
I could really use your help.
You try to save your friends,
you’re gonna get eaten.
We’re Team Not Eaten.
Did he just say they’d eat us?
Yes.
What was that?
Romeo Command, we’re approaching
the research facility
from the southeast corner.
All right,
proceed to the lab on seven.
Copy that.
Dan, you should know
the Whitespikes can smell blood
from a mile away.
So be careful.
Is that... is that one of them?
What is he doing?
He’s taking souvenirs.
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, you can’t take that
with you.
Shh.
This guy shushes me.
Dan. You got to see this.
What is that?
Command, we found your team.
No survivors.
All right, Dan, I’m gonna
need you to head to the row
of biomedical freezers
along the south wall in the lab.
Dan, if they left bodies behind,
they’re gonna come back.
So you need to move fast.
The lab director’s
office is on your left.
- Get the hard drives.
- Copy that. You got that?
- I got it.
- This office right here.
All data, all hard drives,
everything.
Entering the lab.
What are we looking for?
I need
all the biological material
from lab one, and I need those
blue ampoules from lab two.
On me. Lab two.
Oh, no. I see something.
Where?
I don’t see anything.
Guys, something’s watching us.
What? Like Whitespikes?
- Well, duh.
- It’s moving.
You-you don’t see it?
Colonel, they’re gonna
start the bombing.
Where are these blue ampoules?
Along the south wall.
How many we looking at?
12, Dan. I need all of them.
-Got ’em. -All right,
ready the extraction team.
We need to get ’em
out of there right now!
- Yes, ma’am.
- Watch team, fall back.
Shit.
Cowan?
I want you to rendezvous with me
in the laboratory on the
seventh floor. You understand?
Lab on seven. Copy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
let’s move now! We got to go.
These bombs are
gonna drop in six minutes,
and there’s nothing
I can do about it,
- so you need to move fast.
- Let’s go!
We do not want to go
out the front door.
I’m not sure if something’s
out there or not.
Command, we need a new exit.
Head to the loading dock
at the back,
and take the rear stairwell.
South stairwell. Copy that.
Keep an eye out.
Uh, guys?
That’s them!
Contact above!
Fire!
Downstairs! Go now! Move!
Come on!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
- Go!
- Oh, shit, shit!
Oh, shit!
Move, move, move! Move now! Go!
Go, go! Get out of here!
Necks or the bellies.
That’s the only lethal part
on their body. Let’s go!
Let’s go!
Can anybody hear me?
Get those Humvees on site now!
You heard the colonel.
We need transport now. Let’s go!
Recon, Alpha... one minute.
We can’t afford to lose them.
Romeo Actual, the bombing’s
gonna commence in three minutes.
You have got to get
out of there.
Bravo inbound.
Time to target: 60 seconds.
Go weapons hot.
All right, Actual,
you need to head left
at the next intersection.
You got Whitespikes
closing in on you
from the north and the south.
Uh, Command, we’re going right!
Okay, but you need to stay away
from areas with red smoke.
Contact acquired.
Red smoke visible
at two o’clock.
Form up on me.
Yes! Oh, my God!
What the hell, man?
Attack!
Contact rear!
- Move!
- Move!
Approaching target.
Fox one, package inbound.
Bravo, on me. Danger close.
-Dan, get the hell out of there
right now. -Yeah, no shit!
Enemy’s swarming
the target location.
Bravo team, let’s hit it again.
Move now!
Go!
Come on!
1-1-5, weapons free.
Bravo 2-8 on-site, fully armed.
There’s a shit ton of Spikes
down there.
Friendlies on the ground,
take cover.
Get out of there. Move now.
We’re working on it.
- We got to go!
- No, we can’t leave him.
Final approach, package east.
T minus 30 seconds.
Colonel, they’re not
gonna make it.
Dan, what is your status?
Let’s go!
Dan, you are
in the line of fire.
You have got to get
out of there.
Goddamn it, Dan,
get the hell out of there!
- Working on it, Command.
- Go!
Come on! Let’s go! Move!
- Just go!
- We got this!
Go!
800 meters. Let’s take ’em down.
Weapons free.
Hey. Charlie.
You okay?
Jesus.
Where the hell are we?
Well, we’re not in Miami
anymore, that’s for sure.
Additional personnel required
for off-loading.
All personnel, clear the deck
for incoming.
Come on.
Hey.
Where is everybody?
What do you think?
You should’ve kept going
instead of jumping into that
tunnel to save your friends.
We’re here to save people.
We got to try.
We’re on a mission.
That’s what we’re here to do.
But you didn’t.
Did you?
You’ll see.
Nothing we do here matters.
That’s where you’re wrong.
I don’t believe that one bit.
I don’t think
you believe that, either.
You don’t know me.
If nothing matters,
what are you doing here?
Three deployments.
Why you got that...
souvenir around your neck?
It’s not a souvenir.
It’s a reminder.
Of what?
Reminds me of the one thing
I learned the day I got drafted.
I’ll be dead in six months.
Cancer.
So here’s what I’m gonna do.
I’m gonna keep living my life...
the way I want to,
and I’m gonna die
the way I want to.
I’d rather die here
than a slow death back home.
Dan Forester.
That’s me.
Command wants to see you.
You two,
you’re gonna be redeployed.
Nope.
I’m dead, man. I can’t...
You kidding me?
- I can’t do this again.
- Yes, you can.
I’m gonna get killed,
or I’m gonna kill somebody else.
Yes, you can.
And you will.
Okay.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Take care of him.
Sir, we don’t have all day.
Okay. I can survive this.
No, you can’t.
Well, don’t laugh.
You don’t laugh if somebody says
they’re gonna survive something.
These have to make it
to Deepswell in one piece.
Copy that.
Romeo Command?
I believe we’ve met already.
Dan Forester.
Yes, uh, thank you
for recovering the ampoules.
My pleasure. Yeah.
And for trying to find my team.
I’m sorry about that. I’m sorry.
Colonel Forester.
- I’m not a colonel.
- Excuse me.
They’re starting in 20, Colonel.
Copy. Thank you.
Colonel Forester.
First Sergeant Dan Forester,
Special Forces.
Uh, former, in a past life.
Forester. That’s funny.
Uh, you spell that... one "R"?
Just one "R."
Me, too.
Wait, where...
Where your people from?
Same place that you’re from.
Muri.
You’re my Muri Forester?
I’m Muri Forester.
Wow.
You got, uh...
Old?
No, you look great. You, uh...
I mean, just...
Compared to
the last time I saw you, you...
Y-You...
I didn’t know if you were alive.
Don’t.
Okay.
Let’s take a walk.
Colonel.
Colonel Forester...
Gonna take me a minute
to get used to that one.
I have a few different titles.
I guess when you’re down
to less than 500,000 people
on the planet,
you wear a few hats.
I always figured you would’ve
went into science.
I did.
R-Force is my creation.
I’m the lead researcher.
Wow. Come on.
Yeah, I have a PhD
in biotechnology
with an emphasis
in genomics and immunology.
Cal State?
MIT.
MIT?
Well, I hope I was proud of you.
I am. I’m proud of you.
Look, you need
to understand something.
This is the end.
Within the next few weeks,
the human species will disappear
from the face of the earth.
We are literally living
on borrowed time.
So you should know that
nothing about this for me
is sentimental.
I didn’t in any way
bring you here
because I wanted
to spend time with my father.
I brought you here for a reason.
Well, what’s the reason?
I’ll tell you
when you need to know.
Yes, ma’am.
Do you want to see something
really dangerous?
I feel like literally
that’s all I’ve been doing
since I got here, but okay.
What is that?
That’s not what I saw in Miami.
No, the ones that you fought
in Miami were the males.
This is a female.
She’s very aggressive
and much more rare.
They typically nest underground,
and the males are
fiercely protective.
They would die to defend her.
All they seem to care about is
the survival of the species.
Attention!
Carry on.
All right, listen up, everybody.
Greenwood, this is Dan Forester.
He’s gonna be joining us
for the extraction.
He’s gonna need full armor.
The toxin kills the males
just fine.
It makes quite a mess of them,
actually.
But when we sent a team in
to clean out the nests,
we found dozens of dead males
and her.
So the females
survive the toxin.
And now you want to find out
why it didn’t kill her?
In order to find out what can.
Vipers Two, Three and Four
are ready
to sedate and cage the female.
Greenwood and I will provide
recon and air support.
- Got it? Any questions?
- No, ma’am.
Her physiology is the key
to their extinction.
It’s kind of our last hope.
Last hope for what?
At finding something
that will kill them all.
Okay. We’re in and out
real quick. Let’s go.
They’re everywhere.
Yeah, one day,
they were just here.
They were stealthy.
They landed somewhere remote,
avoided all satellite imagery
and radar.
They started
tearing apart Russia.
Three years later,
every major landmass...
North and South America,
Australia,
Asia, Africa, Europe...
Are devoid of human life.
Three years. I mean, they must
be reproducing so fast.
They have no use
for prisoners or government,
technology, money... nothing.
We are food.
And they are hungry.
Muri, when they gave me this...
they said, uh...
they said I’d die
in seven years.
Yeah, last time I saw you
was the day that you died.
It’s like seeing a ghost.
What happened?
What happened? Like...
how-how did you die?
No.
What happened before I died?
What happened to me?
Wh... You know,
what happened to your mom?
I think the less that we say
to each other, the better.
Ranger Team One,
Viper Five coming topside.
Has the female been sedated?
We’re throwing
everything we can at her.
Fire team has her cornered.
She’s in Cave One.
We tranqed her pretty hard.
She’s fighting it,
but she’s feeling it.
We could use some help
- getting her in the cage.
- Roger. Rope.
Keep pulling!
Got to fight.
Come on.
Man down! Man down!
All right, take it down
and give me cover.
- We’re going in.
- Yeah, I need a gun.
No, you’re staying in the helo.
You’re up.
Go, go, go!
Someone get a harpoon
on that tentacle!
R Team, incoming, Cave Two!
Fire in the hole!
Get ready.
I’m about to piss her off.
Greenwood, now!
Pull!
- Pull her in the cage!
- Do it now!
The colonel is down.
I repeat, the colonel is down!
Stay in the helo.
Hang on!
Now!
Come on, pull!
We got her ass.
Viper One, get her out of here.
We’ll get the next one.
Viper Four, enemy contact...
Your three o’clock!
Run!
- Cover!
- Go!
You put yourself in danger.
I made a judgment call.
Yeah, you could’ve screwed up
my mission.
I was trying to help.
That’s not what
I asked you to do.
I need you to stay alive.
You were under attack.
I wasn’t gonna sit in a helo
and listen to my daughter
get eaten.
Sorry.
I’m still your dad.
You know, I used to want
to be like you.
I wanted to be you.
I believed in you
when nobody else did.
And then?
What? What happened?
Talking about a period
of my life that I haven’t lived
but you have.
Enlighten me. What happened?
You left us.
Bullshit. No, I didn’t.
Yeah, you left us.
That nearly killed Mom,
you know.
She believed in you, too.
Just like I did.
I know for a fact
I would never leave you.
Yeah, that’s what I thought.
When I was 12,
you guys separated.
And then you told me that
everything was gonna be okay.
And then, when I was 14,
you divorced.
You... you just never...
You never seemed happy
with your life.
And then, on my 16th...
We got a call from the hospital.
You were in a car accident.
I was there in the ICU.
I heard your last heartbeat
on the monitor.
I was there...
when everyone rushed in
and they pushed me away.
And I watched them shock you
over and over again.
You know, Mom had tried
to help me
separate from you, but I, um...
I couldn’t.
I didn’t want to,
because I wanted you to see me.
I wanted you to hear me.
I wanted you to...
to fix it and...
and save our family.
I didn’t want you to walk away.
And then you were gone.
Deepswell-9,
Viper Actual on approach.
Copy, Actual.
Drone escort en route.
Excuse me. I’m looking
for Colonel Forester.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Morning.
How are you holding up?
Oh, I’m okay.
I’m good.
Want to give me a hand?
Yeah.
Yeah, uh...
What can I do?
Uh, just grab that controller
and, uh, take her up for me.
It’s the top left switch.
Ugh. She stinks.
Yeah, she’s, um, secreting
something like sweat.
-You sure it’s safe
to be that close? -No.
That’s why we sedated her.
Gave her 180 milligrams
of hydromorphone.
Did you say 180 milligrams?
Per day?
Every hour.
You know, the female genetics
aren’t that different
from the males.
The toxin still affects them,
but for some reason, her body is
much better at detoxifying it.
So you just got to figure out
what she’s using
to attack the toxin.
You can design an enzyme
inhibitor to neutralize it.
And then we can kill them all.
Oh, yeah.
The only problem is finding out
what’s stopping the toxin.
It can be one of
a thousand things.
We’ll need hundreds
of variations...
to make thousands of tests.
With any luck, we should have
a working female toxin
by the morning.
I scrounged up some dinner.
Have two options:
veggie lasagna and...
veggie lasagna.
That’s how you know
you’re near the end.
Okay, let’s see how fast
we can denature this thing.
Yeah.
It’s gonna run a thousand tests.
See if we can break down
this sucker.
We can.
We can. This is gonna work.
You’re gonna save the world.
37% bond.
That could be
the inhibitor, right?
Yeah, it’s not a great bond.
- It’s something, isn’t it?
- It’s something.
It’s gonna have to be
a lot stronger
so that the female doesn’t
break down that toxin,
but it is a great start.
- It’s a start.
- I’ll give you that.
49% bond.
The Miami Dolphins ever win
the Super Bowl?
Do you really want to know?
Yeah.
56% bond.
What year, specifically,
and what was the spread?
68% bond.
Jesus.
Once you figure out this toxin,
do you have a way
of deploying it?
Well, I have a solution.
But, uh, you know, it’s not
really worth talking about it
until I know that this thing
works for sure.
Understood. Yeah.
You got a lot of work to do.
I’ll just...
I’ll make dinner.
You know, there’s another
Sabbath coming up tomorrow.
Yeah. I know.
That’s when I leave.
Right.
It’s a... a big day
all around, I guess.
I want to help.
It’s okay. You know, it’s, um...
just kind of
a one-person job anyway.
Muri.
Your mom would be really proud
of you right now.
I know I am.
Good night, Chickpea.
She never quits.
I came down here to see
if she needed help.
I should’ve known.
Is that right?
You would know
more than anyone, right?
Not really.
She was nine years old
last time I saw her.
Stubborn, but...
She calls it "persistent."
Now more than ever,
she has to be.
What do you mean?
You know, one way or another,
this war is...
almost over.
Ticktock.
62% bond.
Now starting "R" sequence.
Range one through 37.
How’s it going?
Going great.
I’ve discovered
roughly 10,000 ways
to not achieve
sufficient potency.
Why don’t you take a break.
Let me try some of this.
No, I’m fine. I got it.
52% bond.
Come on.
Muri.
You don’t have to do this
on your own.
You know that?
You brought me here
for a reason, you told me.
I know that I have some purpose.
Please.
Tell me how I’m gonna help you.
30% bond.
Okay.
If this toxin works,
I need you to take it back.
We can’t make it here.
We’re on borrowed time already.
You have the resources
and the ability
to mass-produce it in your time,
and then you can stop this war
from ever happening.
Muri, what are you asking me?
You’re asking me to save
my future, but then what?
Leave you?
Here, to die?
I know.
I know what
I’m asking you to do.
No, there’s got to be
another way.
Believe me,
I’ve thought of everything,
and this is the only way.
I’m asking you to do what
no one else is willing to do.
Why me?
Because you’re my father.
And there’s no one
that I want to trust more.
All right, Muri.
Okay.
I’ll take the toxin back.
I’ll have it mass-produced.
But understand this:
I am not going to leave you
here to die.
I’m coming back for you.
And you and me,
we’re gonna save this world.
Together.
100% bond.
R-7.
Try R-7.
R-7.
Shit.
Incoming! Incoming!
Oh, shit!
They breached the perimeter!
They’re surrounding us.
Listen to me.
They’re destroying
the perimeter defense.
Oh, my God, the minefield.
They’re coming for her.
I need to get this
to safety right now.
- No, we have to kill her.
- No!
This is all the toxin we have.
We cannot waste it.
Come on. Move! Go!
Eight minutes to jump.
I need you to do
exactly what I say
when I say, how I say it.
Do you understand?
You’re our mission now.
I have to protect you.
- I understand.
- You have got to make it back.
I promise.
What about you?
We’re getting in the chopper.
You can make the jump
from the air.
Greenwood,
I’m taking Dan to Viper One.
I’ll hold ’em off
as long as I can.
All personnel,
prepare for possible impact.
All personnel, prepare
for possible impact.
This is Colonel Forester.
I have a working toxin.
I want my chopper on the pad
ready to fly.
- We’re on our way.
- I copy, Colonel.
This is Viper One
standing by on Pad Two.
Colonel!
They’ve breached
the bottom decks.
The only way
to the helipad is up top,
through the engine room.
Copy.
Start evac
for all nonessentials.
Everybody else, listen up.
We need you at
your defensive positions.
We have got to protect
the Jumplink.
This toxin has got to go back
on the next jump.
Seven minutes to jump.
Go, go, go! Be quick.
Straight ahead, go.
Six minutes to jump.
This is Forester.
We’re entering the engine room.
Viper One copy.
Be advised, we’ve
got Spikes on-site, Colonel.
Watch your six.
Five minutes to jump.
Now!
Four minutes to jump.
Move! Move! This way!
We’re almost there!
Shit.
Hey, hey, hey. You all right?
I’m... I’m okay.
This is Viper One.
I can’t stay here.
Spikes are all over us.
Put your arm around me.
Colonel, meet me
at the helipad on Rig Two.
Three minutes to jump.
Mayday! Mayday!
Viper One going down!
I need you to move.
We got to get up.
We got to move.
Come on. On three.
One... Hey.
One, two, three.
You got to leave me here.
Hey.
We’ll just sit here for a while.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- I’m sorry.
- Hey.
I’m sorry I said
all those things to you.
I shouldn’t have said them.
I was angry, and I didn’t mean
to hurt you.
It’s okay.
I’m so happy
I got to see you like this...
How you were when I was a kid.
This is how I remember you.
We can’t quit.
We cannot quit right now.
We can’t do this right now.
- You have to take this.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
I’m not leaving you.
No.
You got to leave me.
We were never going to make it.
You need to make sure
this never happens.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
No.
Hang on!
20 seconds until jump.
No. No.
Forester. Forester.
Can you hear me?
Forester.
The toxin.
What?
The green vial... where is it?
It-it’s in your hand.
We tried to get it from you,
but you wouldn’t let us.
We need to mass-produce this
and send it back.
It’ll kill ’em all.
The Jumplink just went off-line.
We can’t send anything back.
We can’t travel to the future.
It’s over.
Oh, Muri.
Lieutenant Hart,
please report to command now.
I’m sorry.
Lieutenant Hart,
please report to command.
I’m sorry.
Charlie.
You made it.
I hid.
Daddy!
I made this for you.
I made it
the second that you left
-because I just knew you were
gonna come home. -Yeah.
I got sparkles all over my room.
And then that was my handprint.
Like, we painted
over top of my hand.
And look... look at
all of the glitter.
Mommy helped me with the words.
Do you like it?
What I’m about to tell you
is gonna be...
it’s gonna sound crazy.
She was there.
Our little girl.
She’s smart. She’s a scientist.
I don’t... W-Wait, I’m confused.
You saw Muri?
Yeah.
You’re saying you literally
physically saw our daughter?
We worked together.
On a toxin.
She figured it out.
She was gonna kill them all.
She was gonna save the world.
And, uh...
Hey, it’s okay.
Now I’ve got a solution
and no way to use it.
So we got to figure it out.
We got to figure it out.
Hey.
We’re gonna figure
this out together.
Okay.
What do we know? We know when
and where they land, right?
The first attack
is in late summer
- in, uh, northern Russia, 2048.
- Okay.
So, what if there’s a whole army
waiting for them
when they get off their ships?
Yeah. But there were no ships.
There was no satellite footage
of any rockets, nothing.
They searched everything.
They couldn’t find it.
They had to have
gotten here somehow.
Exactly. All we know is...
they were just here.
Just because
they attacked in 2048
doesn’t mean that’s
when they got here.
What if they got here
in ’47, ’46?
I mean, it’s
the middle of nowhere, Russia.
We wouldn’t have found
their ships.
Because we’re looking
at the wrong year.
Holy shit.
I got to call somebody.
Who are you gonna tell them
came up with the solution?
From me. I’m gonna definitely
say that I came up with it.
- I think it was your wife.
- It’s all good. It’s all good.
With contact
to the future now severed,
governments have been unable
to stop rioting
and looting from spreading
across the globe,
as most now believe that,
in 30 years,
humanity will be wiped off
the face of the earth.
Did you miss me?
First round is on me.
Yeah, no one’s gonna
stop you, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Dorian.
There’s still a chance
that we can stop
this war from ever happening.
It doesn’t look like it.
Told you it was all for nothing.
It’s too late for heroes,
Forester.
I’m not a hero.
I was trying to save
my daughter.
If I got to save the world
to save her,
then I’m damn sure gonna do it.
What kind of selfish dick
doesn’t help a guy
save his kid, right?
You still got that claw?
Well, there is something here.
But it’s not sediment.
Or blood.
It’s ash. It’s volcanic ash.
And it’s not from Russia.
It’s from China.
- Or Korea. Somewhere in there.
- How do you know that?
Oh, you want me to explain the
chemical makeup of the sediment?
Fuck no.
So, how does
Chinese volcanic ash end up
on an island in northern Russia?
You know any volcano experts?
Am I in trouble?
Martin, the lives of every man,
woman and child on this planet
could be saved
if we could just get the answer
to one question,
and it’s all about volcanoes.
I knew this would happen.
Oh, I would’ve killed for a
moment like this in high school.
How would a creature
who’s only ever stepped foot
in northern Russia
get volcanic ash from China
or Korea under its claws?
Well, this would be weird,
but...
it would have to be from
the Millennium Eruption.
The Millennium Eruption.
What the hell is that?
The Changbai volcano
on the border
of China and Korea
erupted in 946 A.D.
with the force of over
a thousand nuclear bombs.
It blew ash over half the world,
and today, you can still find
that ash buried in ice.
Is there any way to pinpoint
exactly where in Russia
that ash would’ve landed?
Laptop.
I love this kid.
Thanks.
Check this out.
This is the largest glacier
in Russia.
Scientists doing
deep drill experiments there
found volcanic ash
at a depth of 400 meters,
a depth consistent
with the average snowfall
since the year 946 A.D.
But to get ash
in the claws, I mean,
they would have to dig through
a thousand years of ice.
They didn’t dig down.
They dug up.
That’s why there’s
no sign of impact.
They’ve been here
the whole time.
Why wait a thousand years
to dig out?
Martin, can you bring up an
ice melt projection for Russia?
Yeah, polar ice melt, uh,
Russia, 2023 to 2048.
There it is.
They didn’t wait it out.
They thawed out.
We have to get to Russia.
No. You’re not going to Russia.
- But that’s where they are.
- Well, we think.
No, we know.
That has to be where they are.
Have any proof?
We have to go there
to get the proof.
Listen, if we can go there now
and kill them all,
we prevent this from ever
happening, you understand?
We’ve lost all contact
with the future, Forester.
President just placed
the armed forces on high alert.
They’re rioting at the border.
Buenos Aires, Johannesburg,
Mexico City,
Istanbul, London.
NATO’s disbanded.
And-and you want me to use
taxpayer money
to fund a special covert mission
into a hostile sovereign nation,
led by a biology teacher?
Oh, also the head of R and D
for a tech company.
Wallace Technology... we’re
the Amazon of earth sciences.
I can tell I’m not
convincing you at all. That’s...
Look, guys...
the way things are going,
we’ll be lucky if we don’t
kill each other off
long before the aliens get here.
Excuse me.
Well, I hate to say
I told you so,
but people just hate
spending money on research.
I say we just go kill ’em
ourselves. How about that, huh?
No, Russia’s closed its borders.
I mean, we need a plane
and a pilot willing to commit
an international felony,
whatever that’s called.
There’s no way we can get there.
There may be a way.
So, how was the future?
Miami Dolphins still suck?
I need a plane.
And a pilot.
To fly undetected
into Russian airspace
so I can get a team of soldiers
to the top of a glacier island
in order to find...
an alien spaceship.
Wow, you know,
they say kids never come by
unless they need something.
I need your help.
I’ll get my coat.
Thank you for coming.
Yeah. We made as much
of the toxin as we could.
- I hope it’s enough.
- Me, too.
I worked with Colonel Forester.
She was your daughter, right?
Yeah.
It was an honor
to have known her.
And four.
Our man brought
the whole arsenal.
Yeah.
’Cause this time,
I’m not gonna hide.
I’m gonna fight.
It’s not even loaded.
It-it’s not loaded.
It’s a pressurized cabin.
Why would I load it
in the cabin?
A bullet goes in the thing,
and everybody’s sucked out.
Dropping to 1,000 feet.
Okay, guys,
so we’re looking for, like,
geothermic anomalies, okay?
Anything weird,
like fissures, heat plumes
or magnetic spikes.
Let’s grid up and cover this
part of the glacier by sundown.
We’ll start with
the southeastern quadrant.
We’ll gain a good vantage point
if we can get to the peak
of the ice cap before sundown.
Might as well be
looking for an ice cube.
Approaching
the northwestern quadrant.
Looks rough up ahead.
Watch your visibility.
Are your gauges acting up?
Yeah.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Feel that?
Yeah, it’s like
something electrical.
Something.
Whoa. Look at that.
We sitting on a magnetic field
or something?
This is a giant block of ice.
Anything, like,
magnetically charged
would be at least
a thousand feet down.
I think we found your ice cube.
Going hot.
Is that it?
So you’re telling me
all this is melting in 30 years?
Well, one degree
is the difference
between ice and water.
Okay, well...
at least we have proof.
We go in there, there’s
a chance we don’t come out.
We can leave right now.
Go back with photographs,
show everybody the world has
a common enemy to fight.
Absolutely.
Go tell the U.N.,
and they can talk about it
till we’re all dead.
Yeah. I mean, I hate to agree
with Conspiracy Santa,
but, you know, we get
the world governments involved,
it could turn into a nightmare.
Yeah.
I don’t have that kind of time.
Neither does Muri.
Feel like this is
my opportunity to give her
and give this world
a second chance.
Second chances are
really hard to come by.
So, what are we gonna do?
I guess we’re gonna cut
that son of a bitch open
and shoot anything
that looks sideways at us.
Guys.
You’re secondary perimeter.
If we don’t come out
and something else does,
it cannot leave this cave.
You understand?
Roger that.
Good luck.
Looks like we found our cockpit.
Those aren’t Whitespikes.
They most certainly are not.
They didn’t want to land here.
This is a crash site.
Let’s move.
The Whitespikes.
They’re cargo.
Ready to breed, like cattle.
Or weapons.
Uh, planet-clearing weapons?
Yeah, but they crashed.
Who’s to say
Earth was their target?
It doesn’t matter.
When we’re done with them,
it’ll be like
they were never here at all.
Let’s go.
She did it.
Ikemba!
Go! Get ’em! Dose ’em!
Take the corner.
Charlie, James,
we got Whitespikes on the move!
Shit.
I got the entrance covered.
Go! We’ll get the ones
in the ship.
Give me that C-4. In
case one of us gets in trouble,
we got to blow this thing
manually, all right?
- No timers.
- No, no, no, no.
Take this.
As a souvenir.
Go save your daughter.
Let’s go!
I go left. You go right.
We got this.
No one’s hiding today.
Whoops.
Oops?
Uh-oh.
Shit. Charlie.
Charlie.
Charlie, I need you!
Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie!
Charlie? Dad?
I got contact!
Light ’em up!
They’re on the move!
Light ’em up! Fire!
Holy shit.
There’s a whole colony
down here.
We got to blow the ship!
I’ll hold them off.
Blow the ship!
If I’m gonna die...
I’m gonna die my way!
Dad? Charlie?
You all right?
You okay?
I got one!
Yeah, you did.
He sliced it up
like Julia Child.
One got away, though.
Big one. Red belly.
Oh, shit.
That’s the female.
We better go get her
before she lays an egg
or whatever the hell they do.
Come on, look at you.
Your hands are shaking.
I’m fine.
No, you’re gonna be
a liability out there.
I need you to stay here,
stay with Charlie.
You don’t have to babysit me.
This is the one thing
I’m good at.
Aim for the left ridge.
Mind the horizon.
We only get one shot at this.
Dan.
I found something.
I got tracks here.
Dad, she’s on the move.
Dad, Dad, do you copy?
Surprise, dumbass.
- Move!
- Moving.
- Yeah, she didn’t like that.
- Get her!
Where the hell is she?
Goddamn it.
You stuck her, Dad.
Back-to-back.
Got eyes on her?
No.
She’s bleeding, though.
Maybe she’s down.
No, she ain’t down.
You stuck her, though.
You got her, Dad.
Come here.
Hey.
I’m sorry, son.
No.
- No, no, no, Dad.
- I’m sorry for...
everything.
Die!
Die!
Did you tell it to die?
Yeah.
It worked.
Why didn’t you tell it sooner?
Yeah.
Let’s just take a little break.
Some incredible
images coming out
-of Russia today. -REPORTER 2:
That’s right, Gabrielle.
An explosion rocked
a glacier there,
and top government sources
are saying that it has
something to do with the aliens
and the future war.
As soon as I heard that
the Whitespikes might
already be here,
my actions were swift
and decisive.
A coalition of elite soldiers
under my sole command
eliminated the future
alien threat.
And you know what?
I’d do it again.
Dad!
I love you.
Hey.
You found them?
Yeah.
Yeah, we found ’em.
Hey.
Chickpea...
I’d like you to meet
your grandpa.
I never told her about
our seven days together
nor how, in a future
that now will never happen,
she changed me forever.
I’m never gonna leave her.
I’ll never leave this family.
Because my best future,
it turned out,
was always right in front of me.
