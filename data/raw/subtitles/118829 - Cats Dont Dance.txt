Once upon a time,
there was a princess and a peasant.
She lived atop a hill
in a glittering castle.
There she had a servant
who kept her castle in order...
... selected and pressed her robes
for the day...
... prepared her royal breakfast
and served it to her in her chambers.
- She had fame, she had fortune.
- Bravo. Delightful.
She had product endorsements.
But she was not what she seemed.
On the other hand,
in a humble village far away...
... the peasant had none of her luxuries,
but he had a dream.
So with a fond farewell
from his closest friends...
... and gifts of good luck,
best wishes...
... and useless junk...
Although it's the thought that counts.
- His world was about to
clash with hers...
... in a place called Hollywood.
Goodbye!
Since I was a little kitten
I had a dream
My name in lights
Danny, the song and dance cat
I got on a bus and came to the town
Where dreams can come true
It's gonna happen for me
It could happen for you
Who, me?
You can do anything
If you try
The most impossible dream
Can come true
If you believe it
This is my kind of town
It's as clear as the nose on your face
This is the time
This is the place
This is the time
- So long.
- Taxi!
This must be the place
Hollywood
Where the streets
Are paved with gold
Where the kitties never grow old
In Hollywood
Hollywood
Where the stars don 't shine at night
They walk around in the broad daylight
In Hollywood
Dig that face
They ain 't seen nothing like it
Anyplace
It's right above the movie screen
If you know what I mean
Look at me
I'm gonna be the cat to see
I'm going down in history
Just watch me!
Hollywood
Where the streets are paved with gold
Where dreams can never grow old
Right here in Hollywood
Well, hi, there, ma'am.
How you doing?
What's your name there? Okay.
I'm Danny. Do you mind if I sit down?
- Excuse me.
- Cranston!
Don't mind him, Danny.
He was just leaving.
Hi. I'm Tillie. This is Cranston.
Cranston, Danny. Danny, T.W.
T.W., Danny. Danny, Frances. Frances,
Danny. T.W., Frances. Frances...
So, new in town?
I just arrived. L...
I hear Farley Wink
gets good parts for animals.
If you call hanging from a hook
a good part.
At least it's a part, huh?
There's no use trying, Miss Tillie.
My fortune cookie last night said:
"Give it up, you loser."
I need a drink.
All right, now, let's see.
"Go to Hollywood." Check.
What you got there?
Well, this is a plan I worked out.
You see, I figure if I work real hard,
by Friday I'll land my first big part.
Well, that's how it worked
for you, right?
- Oh, sure. Right.
- Oh, right.
Why not Thursday?
Now, Danny, you just go in
and let Mr. Wink know you're here.
They're casting a big Noah's Ark movie.
Lots of work for animals.
Your tie is a little crooked.
Wait a minute. Straighten you up,
dust you off and perfect.
Good luck.
- Thanks a lot.
- Look, you big ape!
I need those two monkeys
for another picture.
What? This is a bad time.
I'm casting the Ark picture.
Get off the line!
Yes, hello. Wink here.
- Mr. Wink?
- Yes!
If you have any openings for a talented
cat, I'm your man. I mean, your cat.
Send over two chickens and two lions.
But don't send them over
in the same car this time.
Let's see now.
- Say, you. Can you play a cat?
- I am a cat.
How would you like to be
in the next Darla Dimple picture?
The Darla Dimple? America's sweetheart,
lover of children and animals?
One and the same, kid.
One and the same.
Just sign here, here, here, here,
and here and here and here and here...
...and over there and down the middle...
- Sawyer, what happened to you?
- Did you walk under a ladder?
Smash a mirror?
- Have you looked in one lately?
- No. A cat crossed my path.
- Really? Orange tabby?
- Yeah.
- Green vest? Straw hat?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- What a koinky-dink.
- How'd you know?
Hippo intuition.
- And initial this.
- Wow, this is a dream come true.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't forget,
10 percent of that dream is mine.
Welcome to Hollywood!
Farley Wink's Animal Agency.
Can I help you?
- You need a lamb for the Moses picture?
- Yeah!
Oh, a sacrificial lamb?
- No, no.
- Sorry, fresh out.
Every day I ask myself
why I put up with this.
- For the glamour.
- What, this pigsty?
- No offense, Herb.
- None taken.
Unless of course, you're
referring to the glamour of filing...
...the romance of typing.
- Tillie, what are you doing?
- I'm just fixing you up.
You'll wanna look pretty
in case you meet someone nice.
Yeah, right. As if he'll come waltzing
right through that...
You're gonna be fine, kid.
You're the cat's meow.
You can meow, can't you?
Where's Sawyer?
- Sawyer. Sweetie, baby!
- Whatever it is, the answer is no.
- I'm in a jam.
- Too bad.
- Can't find a female cat for the picture.
- Tough tabby.
- So guess who gets to fill in.
- You?
Nah, I only fill in
for those dashing Clark Gable types.
Frankly, Clark, I don't give a...
- Sawyer!
- I'm a secretary, not an actress.
- Give you Sundays off.
- Never work Sunday.
- Double time.
- Triple.
- Triple?
- There an echo?
- You're pushing me!
- No chow, no meow.
Okay, okay, triple time. Here's your
partner. He's new in town. Be nice.
Forget it.
A deal is a deal.
Now get on over to Mammoth Pictures.
You're...
You're... You're soaking wet.
Is it raining outside?
Because it was sunny when I came in,
and back where I come from...
Here, let me get the door for you.
Where I come from you see clouds first.
- Stay.
- After you.
And then the rain comes after it.
I'm sorry. Miss?
Oh, I'm telling you,
one more plucking scene...
...and... right in the gizzard.
So aggravating and humiliating.
I'm out of this picture business.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
So I guess we're gonna be
the only two cats on the ark, huh?
- Pretty great, huh?
- So much for preserving the species.
Hey, Kong, how's the picture coming?
Don't get me started!
You know the King?
On my side of the tram,
home of Darla Dimple...
...America's sweetheart.
Look for Darla in Lil Ark Angel...
...coming soon to a theater near you.
All right, everybody.
We're ready for Darla's big ark.
Hey. Hey, mister. I could
help you push that cart, you know.
Hey. What are you doing?
Get out of here, kid.
Let me help, will you?
I'm little but I'm strong.
- These sweets are for Miss Dimple.
- Okay, all right.
You don't have to get mad.
I'm busted.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're the cat from this morning?
- What are you doing here?
- That ice thing is just my side job.
Name's Peabo Pudgemyer.
But you can call me Pudge.
Time to start.
Better go get your costume.
Script! Script! Script!
"Meow"? Is that all?
Where's the rest?
- You're looking at it.
- But I thought this was a musical.
We're supposed to sing and dance,
aren't we?
Oh, for the love of Moby Dick.
Listen, tiger, this town has rules.
Around here, cats say "meow."
But that's so old hat. I'm sure
no one would mind if I jazz this up a bit.
All right, learn it the hard way.
Meow, see.
Yeah, that's it, meow, meow.
Quiet on the set, please. Quiet!
Miss Dimple is ready to begin.
Lights! Camera!
Action.
Cue the elephant.
Tusk, tusk, hair.
- The hair, the hair, fix the hair.
- Sorry.
Now, the people, they were so bad
That the Lord made the rain come down
And he washed away their bad cities
And he washed away their bad towns
And all of the people drowned
With the animals it was different
Though some of them drowned too
The others were just poor animals
And they didn 't know what to do
So I built a little boat
As cute as it can be
And I put all the animals two by two
In my little boat on the sea
The moo cows went:
The piggies went:
And all the little birdies went
Tweet, tweet, tweet
In my little boat on the sea
The doggy went:
The kitty cat went:
The lion went:
- In my little boat on the sea
- Talking about the boat on the sea
On the sea
Meow?
- Cut! Cut, cut, cut!
- Cut? Yes, cut.
Let me down this instant!
Lower Miss Dimple! Lower her!
Hurry! Hurry! Lower Miss Dimple!
Darla. Darla, darling. Here...
Flanigan, the title of this movie
is Lil Ark Angel.
- Isn't it?!
- Yes. Yes.
And who here is an angel?
Can you tell me who here is an angel?!
Why you are, Darla, sweetheart,
celebrity, darling.
- Angel.
- That's right! I am an angel!
I am an adorable little angel!
Bonbons will make it better.
- Hot fudge sundae?
- Your choo-choo?
Your ducky?
I hate animals!
Especially that one!
Get me down from here!
Flanigan!
Oh, dear, what a calamity.
Max!
We're doomed.
Hide me!
Yes, Miss Dimple.
Been nice knowing you, pal.
How does the kitty cat go?
Meow?
Very good.
Will that be all, Miss Dimple?
For the moment. Thank you, Max.
- Your curls are fine.
- Your nails are precious.
- Goodbye, Miss Dimple.
- Goodbye, Miss Dimple.
Okay, everybody. From the top.
And I hope there will be
no more interruptions.
- Cue me, Frances.
- So the kitty cat went:
Now, just cut that out.
Besides, it was much more like:
Danny, wait.
Now see what you made me do.
Oh, dear.
Maybe one of us should talk to him.
Hello. I'll do it.
It's time somebody set that cat straight.
Since he tap-danced into town,
he's been nothing but trouble.
Well, I guess this is gonna
set me back a whole day.
Maybe only half a day.
Listen, I'm sorry your feelings got hurt,
but the fact is, since you...
I don't get it.
What happened in there, anyway?
- Did I hit a sour note?
- Wait.
Because if I did,
I could go back in there.
- I could fix it.
- You don't... Danny, they don't care.
- But l...
- Don't you get it?
What is it with you? Why are you so
determined to make a fool of yourself?
What do you mean?
All I wanna do is the thing I love.
Doesn't everyone?
- It's not that simple.
- It is in Kokomo.
Then maybe that's
where you should have stayed.
You can do anything
If you...
I better not sing right now.
You want some?
No thanks, Pudge.
I was gonna slug
that big dumb Max for you...
...but I didn't wanna hurt the guy.
So, what's that Dimple kid's problem?
- I thought you were great today.
- I'm glad you liked it.
You know, all that:
No, it's a little more like...
Here, I'll show you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute. Where's...?
Where's that music coming from?
- It's him. It's Woolie the Mammoth.
- It's him. It's Woolie the Mammoth.
That's it! B flat.
Why, you have a natural rear for music,
little fellow. Little fellow.
If my old eyes aren't failing me,
I'd say...
...you're the fellow
who caused all that commotion today.
Yeah. I guess I really upset Miss Dimple.
Yes, you did.
Jolly good show!
- Tea time. Would you chaps like a cup?
- Sure.
Splendid! It's a special peanut brew
from India, the upper regions.
Did you know the peanut
is not a nut at all?
And it's not a pea
for that matter either.
It's rather odd that they call it a nut
because it isn't a nut, you see.
It's... It's... It's a member
of the legume family.
Sugar?
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. How about pea legume?
No, that wouldn't make sense either.
But whatever it is,
it makes a splendid tea.
My grandmother developed this recipe,
with certain additions from yours truly.
I forgot the cream.
Would you like some cream?
- No, no!
- Don't go to any trouble!
All right. All right.
Suit yourself, suit yourself.
That music was great, Woolie.
Did you write it for some movie?
No, no, it's not for any movie.
I used to hope that one day
I'd write music for the motion pictures.
But all they wanted me for
was to put on those beastly tusks and...
...at the beginning of every film.
- What a waste of your talent.
- Oh, it's the same for everyone.
Look behind you.
So many, many broken dreams.
Is that Sawyer?
Poor Sawyer.
I thought she'd be the one to make it.
Such a dancer
with the voice of an angel.
I never would have guessed.
That's what this town does to you,
my boy.
It wears you down.
But I thought Hollywood
was always looking for new talent.
Talented people, not animals.
You see...
...the spotlight will never be
on fellows like you and me.
And it's foolish
to think otherwise, Danny.
Danny?
Yeah. Foolish.
Unless...
...we can remind them.
- Of what?
- Why they came here in the first place.
All right, all of you, listen up!
I only need you, water buffalo,
for the Tarzan jungle stampede.
The rest of you, go home.
Well, today's shot.
Might as well go home and clean.
Here's our chance, Pudge. Come on!
Hey, everybody!
Look who's back.
I wish he'd get himself stuffed.
I know a divine taxidermist, darling.
Did my first husband.
Come on, everybody, gather around
Don 't let this old town get you down
Look at you there
With the long, long face
Hey, he must be talking to you.
You take this and you take that
Come on over here, T. W., put on this hat
If we all work together
We can make our dreams come true
Let's show the world what we can do
- Pudge?
- Yeah.
Boogie with me!
I got rhythm in my feet
I got rhythm in my heart and soul
I got rhythm, hot and sweet
Sometimes rhythm
Makes me lose control
I want everyone to have all the fun
That I have
I've got rhythm
So do you
Let's turn it on
And show what we can do
Bye!
Perfect.
How could you possibly
improve a face like this?
What is that hideous racket?
Look at them.
I'm ashamed to be an animal.
Shut up, you old nanny,
and show old Franny what you got.
Hey.
Come on, Sawyer.
Grab a partner and do-si-do.
Hey, Sawyer, dance with me?
I hear you're a natural.
Who told you that?
Listen, it's a waste of time.
You'll never get to dance in the movies.
Movies? Did I say movies?
No, we're just having fun.
Yeah, sure. Forget it.
Just look at those fools.
Laughable, isn't it, Max?
Max?
Max!
Not bad. A little rusty
but, hey, who's perfect?
Rusty?
I'll give you rusty.
Like I said, dancing's a waste of time.
What if I could get you
an audition with L.B. Mammoth?
L.B. Mammoth?
Head of Mammoth Studios?
- What?
- I know he'd appreciate real talent.
After nothing but Darla,
he's gotta be starving for it.
- You're dreaming, Danny.
- Maybe I am.
But so were you
just a few minutes ago.
Can you really get us an audition
with the boss, Danny?
It's worth a try.
Once he sees us, there'll be
a whole new set of stars in town.
An audition?
Max! Invite that cat...
...to tea.
Thanks for coming over, Donald.
Danny.
Danny.
Animal cracker?
No? More for me.
I wanted to apologize
for what Max did the other day.
He's so bad sometimes.
- No, it's all right, Miss Dimple. Really.
- No, no, no.
It was terrible. Awful.
Cruel.
Inappropriately violent.
And I wanna make it all up to you.
No, no, you don't have to.
Oh, I insist.
- Is there anything you need?
- No.
Isn't there something I could do for you?
I don't think so.
Isn't there a certain someone
who runs a certain studio...
...that I could introduce you to?
Well...
Is there any way that you can arrange
for me and the other animals...
...to perform for L.B. Mammoth?
Why, Denis, I'd be delighted.
Idea!
Maybe you can all do a number
in my movie.
- You...? You mean it?
- Why, it's just what the picture needs.
- Oh, but I couldn't impose.
- I'll give you use of my sound stage...
...my ark, and anything else
you might need.
- Really?
- You get all your little friends ready...
...and I'll make sure L.B.
Sees your splashy debut.
- Oh, thank you, Miss Dimp...
- Call me Darla.
- Thank you, Darla.
- Don't mention it.
Sawyer could do a romantic ballad,
and Woolie can even play a piano solo.
Did you hear that, Max?
Woolie, the elephant...
...can even play a solo.
Don't you think
that would be a good idea?
Well, I think...
- You really want my advice?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes, please.
Well...
I've seen 'em come
And I've seen 'em go
There's one thing that I know
You gotta give the people
What they want
Or you'll wind up back in Kokomo
Nebraska
- Indiana, Miss Dimple.
- Whatever.
They like it big, they like it loud
Maybe a little bit jazzy sometimes
Mr. Pussycat, listen to me
You don 't have to be good
But you had better be
Get hot, Miss Dimple.
Big and loud
Big and loud
Gonna make your mama proud
Make it big
And loud
Leaves you kind of speechless, don't it?
- Thank you, Darla.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I just made a few
professional "suggestments."
You just get all your little friends ready
by Friday at 3...
...and I'll take care of L.B.
And let's keep this between us,
shall we?
I don't like to advertise
my charitable work.
Oh, sure. Thanks, Miss Dimple.
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome, Dino.
- Goodbye.
- Ta-ta!
See you in the movies.
Publicity Department.
Is L.B.'s big press conference
still Friday at 3?
- Yes, it is, Miss Dimple.
- Oh, thank you so much.
I didn 't get where I am today
By letting myself get pushed around
No man or beast or kitty cat or doggie
Is going to drag me down
Shut up, Max.
The lightning will be flashing
The thunder, it will roar
They'll never know what hit 'em
Wait'll they see what I have in store
Big and loud
It's gonna be big and loud
When they fall, they'll really fall
And they're gonna fall big
And they're gonna fall loud
They're gonna fall big
And
Shut up, Max.
Loud
"Thunder and lightning." Check.
Special effects all ready, Danny.
All right, everybody.
Mr. Mammoth will be here any minute.
Get into position. Remember,
do it just like you did in the alley.
Only make it big and loud this time.
- And don't be nervous.
- Nervous? Why would I be nervous?
Give me that.
Well, well. Run of the sound stage,
use of Darla's ark costumes.
- I don't know. Something smells fishy.
- I beg your pardon.
- Sorry, it's just that I smell a rat.
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.
- So you decided to join us, huh?
Me? Oh, no, no, no.
This is never gonna work.
Besides, how did you arrange all of this?
Let's just say
a little angel's looking out for us.
- Oh, boy.
- Come on, Sawyer.
Your life isn't back there
in that office, it's here.
- It's 3:00, Danny.
- Dance with me.
See you onboard.
- Well?
- I can't do this.
- And?
- I can't do this.
- So?
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
Fortune says, "Rough waters ahead."
Start the rain, Pudge!
When L.B. Shows up,
we'll all come out singing and dancing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...
...I bring you
the founder of Mammoth Pictures...
...Mr. L.B. Mammoth!
Gee whiz, Mr. Mammoth,
what's the secret of your success?
Simple. It's Dimple.
Dainty, delightful, Darla Dimple
The recipe for a Darla Dimple movie.
Begin with one part adorable character
in jeopardy.
Sorry, penguin, but into each life,
a little rain must fall.
Max, man the valve.
Yes, Miss Dimple.
Add two parts perky determination.
More water, Max. More water.
Sprinkle in an air of innocence.
Wind, Max. We must have wind!
- Stir in...
- More water!
- Add a pinch of...
- Thunder!
- And an itsy-bitsy dash of...
- Lightning!
Mix it all together
and what do you get?
Throw the anchor!
Somebody throw the anchor.
It's L.B.! We're on!
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile
"Your life isn't back there at the office,"
he says. "Dance with me," he says.
You know what your problem is? You're
pushy, self-centered, pigheaded...
- No offense, Herb.
- None taken.
Action. We're pushing, we're pushing.
We're running, we're running.
And your driving stinks!
Well, maybe you could do better.
Go ahead, you take it.
- You take it.
- You take it.
- No, no, no.
- If you think you know so much...
- Sawyer!
- I don't want it.
Well, it doesn't get any worse than this.
I was wrong. It's worse.
Oh, my. This is an awkward moment.
I don't think we met.
I'm Tillie. Mr. Mammoth, Cranston.
Cranston, Mr. Mammoth.
Flanigan, Cranston...
What appears to be a tidal wave,
folks, is actually just a special effect.
- This has gone far enough. Give me that.
- You didn't want it before. Give it.
Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt
or anything, but we're about to...
- Will you just stay out of this?
- Oh, sorry.
- Let go. Let go.
- I'm telling you...
- Good day, Mr. Mammoth.
- Good day, Mr. Mammoth.
You animals will never...
Nibble kibble in this town again!
I think they liked it.
But it wasn't...
It wasn't their fault.
Nice working with you, Danny.
Let go! Let me go!
Singing and dancing animals.
She was your little angel?
She said she wanted to help us.
- And you believed her?
- But... But l...
Woolie, I would... I'd...
The spotlight will never be
on fellows like you and me.
Go home, son.
Go home.
Goodbye, show biz. Hello, farm work.
Well, there's always Broadway.
Yeah, Broadway.
I hear hippos are very big
on Broadway.
They're big everywhere, darling.
You know, this is all Danny's fault.
You got it, brother.
That toe-tapping tom!
I never trusted him. Too happy.
Well, I have to admit,
we were better off before.
Well, let's face it. That cat
ruined our already miserable lives.
Well, he's just a...
He's a crackerjack is what he is.
- She's right. You're doggone right.
- Nothing but trouble, that guy.
- Horrid little being.
- Bad luck!
Old happy feet better not
show his face around here again.
I never believed
That there was a rainbow
With a pot of gold at the end
I'm much too smart
For fairy tales like that
Yet here I am again
I thought this time
This time we're gonna make it
Why I thought so, I really don 't know
Maybe something in his eyes
Just told me so
Something in his eyes
Tell me lies
And I'll come runnin '
I must have lost my mind
I could close my eyes
And tell you
Just exactly what's comin '
Life's gonna turn
Just a little unkind
Seems like everyone's sailin '
Way out on the sea
And I'm stuck here on the shore
Sun 's always shinin '
But it's never for me
Why should I try anymore?
Tell me lies, tell me lies
I'll just keep right on comin '
This time I've got
To believe
In the dream
This time I've got
To believe
In his dream
Tillie!
You know, you can
still catch him at the bus stop.
Danny! Wait! Danny!
So I guess it's just you
and me tonight, buddy.
Hey, did you hear about that disaster
down at Mammoth Pictures?
Oh, boy!
What were those animals thinking?
I mean, what a bunch of noodleheads.
No offense.
I'm not calling you a noodlehead.
It's just that
they don't belong in pictures.
They belong back on the farm.
Look at them out there.
Poor fools. They ain't got no future.
What am I telling you for?
You're heading home.
You're not trying to be
something you ain't.
You're leaving this mess all behind.
You know your place.
I mean, I know my place, you know.
It's here driving this bus.
You know, you don't see me...
Stop the bus!
Jeez! What do you wanna stop for?
We just barely got started.
Exactly. See you in the movies.
Hey, get off my property.
All of Hollywood is represented here
tonight for the premiere of Lil Ark Angel.
How about a big hand for
Joan Crawford, Cary Grant...
... W. C. Fields, Clark Gable
and L.B. Mammoth?
L.B.!
Carry on.
Ladies and gentlemen,
how about a big hand for Darla Dimple?
America 's sweetheart,
lover of children and animals...
... and the star of tonight's gala
Hollywood premiere, Lil Ark Angel!
Darla Dimple's handprints are enshrined
in the forecourt of the Chinese Theater.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're all gonna
gather inside the theater...
... to see the world premiere
of Lil Ark Angel...
... starring Darla Dimple.
Oh, excuse me.
- Move!
- Excuse me.
Can I just squeeze past, son?
Thank you very much.
Oh, so sorry.
They're in. The minute
the movie ends, we go on.
Yea, as you walk
through your valley of despair...
... fear not, for I am your Lil Ark Angel...
... and I will look after every little
itty-bitty, teensy-weensy one of you.
Shoot me.
My radiant glow shall be a shining
beacon to light the path for you poor...
... helpless animals.
I shall lift you
out of the depths of despair.
My sweet cherubic voice will sing you
a lullaby to soothe your fears.
Think of me as your guardian.
Fear not...
... for I, the Lil Ark Angel...
It's almost time. I'll go set the lights.
Check.
The weatherman says it's going to rain
for 40 days and 40 nights.
Hark, here comes a big fat rain cloud.
Danny. Look behind you, Danny.
Danny.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Nice kitty, kitty.
How does the kitty cat go?
Meow?
Very good.
Danny, the movie's over!
Everybody's leaving! We gotta...
You're a mess.
Do you really love me?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Wait!
Pl... Please, take your seats.
Today we've come to honor
Miss Darla Dimple.
And because Darla Dimple cares,
she's arranged a special treat for you.
Have I?
A special live show
with an all-animal cast.
- Not this guppy.
- Yeah. No, I'm with her.
Come on, Sawyer.
Unheard of, yes, of course,
but not for "America's sweetheart...
...Iover of children and animals."
Max?
No, no, no. Now, don't try
to share the credit.
You're the one who wanted us
to perform for L.B.
And I wouldn't dream of performing
without my frie...
l... l...
Silly cat. Run along now.
Skit scat, Mr. Kitty Cat.
Isn't he cute?
Run along and play, Mr. Kitty.
Sawyer?
We're all behind you, Danny.
One hundred percent.
- Don't let them go.
- I got them.
- Let go! Have you lost your mind?
- Release me, you mad hippo!
- Wait!
- One big happy family!
- Just a minute.
- "You will meet with disaster!"
- Would you listen?
- I'll chew your ears...
- Cranston!
- "The end is near! Fat lady's sung!"
Look, if you're willing to accept
what they think of you, then you can go.
I almost did.
Well, you should have.
Life here for animals is the pits.
We're always playing the scapegoat.
- Quickly forgotten.
- Working for scale.
Then why are you still here?
Because you can't forget the feeling,
can you?
The feeling you have
when you two dance together...
...when you play...
...when you sing.
They cursed you, humiliated you...
...even slammed the door in your face,
but they still haven't made you forget.
Have they?
"They can smash your cookie...
...but you'll always have your fortune."
Come on. Let's go show them
what we can do.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Well, it is kind of getting
kind of more or less rather late.
You couldn't be more right.
Hit it, Pudge!
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen
If you would be so kind
I've got someone very special here
She's about to speak her mind
I've got a song to sing
If you don 't like my song
I'm gonna sing it anyhow
And I got a dream in my heart
- Nothing's gonna stop us now
- Nothing's gonna stop us now
You take four and 20 blackbirds
And bake them in a pie
Before you put 'em in the oven
You know they're gonna fly
And they'll get you
They say curiosity killed the cat
I'm living proof that that's a lie
- Now I'm gonna tell you why
- Now I'm gonna tell you why
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
- Nothing's gonna stop us now
- Gonna stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
- lf I wanna dance, I'll dance
- She'll dance
Just as long as the law will allow
Dance and sing all night long
'Cause nothing's gonna stop us now
- No, no, no one can stop us now
- Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
No, no, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look for me
Where there's the smell of danger
The smell of danger is my middle name
I've been very quiet
But I've got a lot to say
Believe me
If you ain 't going with us
Then stay out of our way
Been knocked down, cut down
Locked down, shut down
- Held down, fell down
- Every time
Been pushed back, bushwhacked
Denied a contract
When you got yours
You must have got mine
- Nothing's gonna stop us
- Nothing's gonna stop us
- Nothing's gonna stop us
- Nothing's gonna stop us
I got a feeling inside
And it's love, without a doubt
- I got someone I'm crazy about
- He's simply mad about her
Nothing's gonna stop us now
No, no, no one can stop us now
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Come on
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the star.
Stupid, stupid cat.
I should have drowned you all
when I flooded the stage!
- Darla Dimple?
- I can't believe it.
Max?!
Oui, Miss Dimple.
Put her there.
Well, now, let's see.
"Go to premiere." Check.
"Land a big part." Check.
"Get the girl"?
Check.
Sweethearts! Celebrities! Darling!
Get a picture, boys.
These kids will be making history.
