Hello?
Hello, Mum?
Who is it? Omar?
Hi, Mum.
Khalid, it's Omar on the phone!
How are you, Mum?
Where are you?
How are things?
How are things in Istanbul?
Don't worry about us,
we're fine.
How are you?
What's the news?
Where are you?
I'm in Scotland.
Scotland?
I'm on an island
somewhere in Scotland.
Khalid, he's on an island
in Scotland.
I thought you were going
to London.
Yeah, I was but...
Are you working?
Mum, I told you.
I can't work without asylum.
Well, how long
is it going to take?
Well?
I don't know.
A few months or more.
More? What if they say no?
What about Germany
or Sweden?
I heard they are nicer
to Syrians there.
Mum, I speak English.
What's that?
Your dad's asking
if it's like Guantanamo.
No. No, it's not like that.
Do you have enough money?
Huh?
I'm OK.
They give me a little
to survive.
I'm not asking that.
What is it, Mum?
Your dad is asking...
...if you can send us money?
Mum...
...I don't have any.
Do you need money?
I don't get enough.
No, no, we're fine.
It's...
Are you eating enough?
Maybe I can send Makdous.
You tell me how to make it.
I almost forgot...
How's your hand, Omar?
Did you get the cast off?
Not yet.
I should get it checked.
Omar, have you heard
from Nabil?
Well?
No.
You?
Not since you left.
Omar, how is the oud?
Is your hand better?
I don't know,
I've not played since...
You need to keep practicing,
Omar.
You can play on the street,
make a bit of money.
People don't care
about the oud here.
So come to Turkey.
Play on the street with me.
You're playing on the street?
Yeah, well...
Dad.
Omar, listen to this.
When...
...I am overcome by weakness,
I bandage my heart
with December's frozen tree
roots...
...trees that have promised
to blossom in spring.
There he is!
Stuff the aubergines
with red pepper...
...a handful of chopped walnuts,
garlic...
...red chilli flakes,
salt and pepper...
...and my special ingredient,
but don't tell anyone, OK?
Between me and you.
All right?
OK, I won't.
Sumac.
Two teaspoons.
Gives it a little zing.
You can make it without but...
No, but I want it to taste
exactly like yours.
Then you need sumac.
Once you fill the jars,
you have to leave it
to preserve
for at least a week, OK?
OK, great.
Omar, have you heard
from Nabil?
No, Mum.
He's so brave
to have stayed...
Omar, I know you two
have had your differences but...
Mum, please.
I don't want you to have
a bad memory of him.
OK.
Are you changing
your bed sheets?
Once a week, remember.
Mum, please.
I made it to Scotland, didn't I?
I can look after myself.
There he is!
There he is!
Omar, Nabil called!
He's well.
He says they had
an important victory
in the north and things
are getting better.
Omar, your father says
we should go back to Syria...
Why?
Why would you do that?
He says things are getting
better.
I said I can bring you here,
once I get asylum.
I know,
but we can't wait forever.
I don't want you
to worry about it.
What do you mean?
You can't tell me
something like that
and ask me not to worry.
Your dad got into a fight
with the police.
They confiscated his oud
and we had to pay a fine.
They treat us like dogs here.
Dad says we should go back
and help like Nabil.
How's Dad going to help?
I don't know.
I think he imagines himself
saving the day.
Like that big muscle-head
German.
What's his name?
The Rambo?
Schwarzenegger.
- Yeah, him.
- He's Austrian.
Rambo's the other one, Stallone.
Rocky?
Yeah, that's Stallone.
So who is the Austrian one?
- The Terminator.
- Ah, The Terminator.
Well, they're both the same
anyway.
I've told him it is not
a good idea, but Nabil said...
Put him on, I'll speak to him.
Omar, they need our help.
It's better than sitting around
doing nothing.
We can't afford
to keep paying the rent here.
We still have a home
to go back to.
Today maybe, but tomorrow?
You'll get yourself killed, Dad.
What are you saying?
I did my national service
during the October War.
1973.
Dad, you're going crazy.
And you?
What about me?
You could go back
and fight like your brother.
They're heroes.
You were the one
telling me I should leave.
We didn't know
what they would do next.
We wanted you to be able
to live up to your potential.
But what are you doing there?
Are you even playing your oud?
You know what a musician is
who doesn't play music?
Dad, you've told me
a thousand times.
A musician
who doesn't play music is dead.
So you want me to go back
and die a martyr now?
That would make you proud,
would it?
Two brave sons,
instead of one coward in the ranks.
I didn't say that.
You can tell
you've been speaking to Nabil.
I didn't say that.
Maybe I can live up
to my potential then?
The three of us can fight
and die martyrs together.
- Maybe even Mum.
- Omar, please.
Nabil asked after you,
he wants to speak to you.
Well, I'm sorry
I'm not a hero like him.
What do you see?
Omar, have you changed
your sheets this week?
Omar...
What is it, my dear?
Is everything OK?
I don't know.
What happened?
Maybe Nabil was right.
Should I have stayed?
We left too...
We left too, Omar.
Everyone left.
You're not going back?
No. No.
Nabil says it's not safe.
But what about the money?
You don't need
to worry about that, Omar.
But I wouldn't have made it here
without the money
you gave me, Mum.
Nabil will send us
some money for now.
I'll pay you back.
They'll answer soon.
I promise.
I'll get the money
and I'll get them
to bring you here.
- I will do it as soon as...
- I want only one thing from you...
Promise me
you'll speak to your brother.
There is a war going on
in our country.
I have to accept that.
But I will not have a war
in our family.
He was asking after you, Omar.
He wants to speak to you.
He sounded different this time,
Omar.
He sounded afraid.
Omar, what if you never
spoke to him again?
That song came on the radio
today.
Remember the song
by Marcel Khalife?
"Asfour".
You played it
on my birthday.
Nabil sang with you.
How old were you?
It was your 40th...
Omar was 15.
It was beautiful.
I forgot Nabil used to sing.
He was good.
A bird stood at my window
And said, "Oh, little one,
"I beg you, hide me with you."
I said, "Where are you from?"
"From the limits of the sky"
I said, "Where did you come from?"
"From the neighbour's house,"
he answered
"Why are you afraid?" I asked
"I escaped from the cage," he said
"Where are your feathers?" I asked
"Fate took care of them," he said
Little bird...
Omar, promise me
you'll speak to your brother.
Nabil: Omar, can we talk?
Nabil: Omar, are you there?
Nabil here, somewhere.
Don't leave a voicemail,
I won't get it.
Just send a text or whatever.
OK, later.
Jesus! It's freezing.
Last time I saw snow
like this was...
That year in Damascus.
We tried to make a snow...
Brontosaurus,
or was it a camel?
No.
Everyone thought we had made a camel
but it was a Brontosaurus.
Ah, yeah.
Did Mum make it?
The apricot tree
isn't there anymore, Omar.
I was waiting for you to call.
Are you happy to see me?
You left without saying goodbye.
You wouldn't have let me go.
- So you ran away?
- I didn't run away.
Why did you have to stay?
- You know why?
- What?
To fight and die like a martyr?
With our souls, with our blood,
we sacrifice for Syria
With our souls,
with our blood...
Stop it!
What do you want, Omar?
You want me to tell you
that I wish I had left like you?
That you did the right thing?
You want my blessing?
I don't need your blessing.
No, come on, here...
Preserve our culture with your music.
Your talent.
The oud as your weapon.
You'll make us all proud.
Omar?
I just want it to be how it was.
You know...
...I've not even played the oud
since I left Syria.
But your hand's better?
Not once, why?
It doesn't sound
like it used to.
It doesn't feel the same.
Omar, a musician
who doesn't play music...
Is dead.
I know.
Don't do that,
you will make me cry.
Stop it, Omar.
I'm scared.
- Why are you scared?
- I'm scared for you.
You were never afraid
of anything.
Even when we were kids.
That's not true.
I was afraid
of Auntie Zainab's kisses
with those big red lips.
We would all be covered
in red stains.
And mum would rub our faces
really hard
to get the marks off.
It was so sore!
I didn't want to leave, Nabil.
I didn't want this.
Come on, play me something.
Omar.
Come on, Omar.
Show me.
I'll tell you how it sounds.
Come on...
Let me escape the world
for a moment.
Rest in peace, my friend.
Thank you.
There he is!
