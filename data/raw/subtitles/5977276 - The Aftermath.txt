"You are about to meet
a strange people
"in a strange enemy country.
"You must keep clear
of the Germans.
"You must not...
"...fraternize."
What does that mean?
It means we shouldn't be
friendly to them.
This house is requisitioned
for British use
by order of
the Control Commission, Germany.
You'll forgive us, Fraulein.
It belongs
to a family Lubert.
He's an architect, sir.
All change.
He's meeting you here, is he?
Susan.
- How was your trip?
- Long.
Quick, let's get home.
Rachael.
Hello, Lewis.
My God. Look at you.
It's freezing.
It is.
Here.
Let me take this.
Welcome. Please come inside.
Let me show you the house.
Please, come inside.
Let me show you the house.
They're still finding bodies.
There's over 25,000 dead
still unaccounted for.
How are you?
Good. Fine. You?
It's...
It's been difficult.
For you, too, I expect.
For all of us.
We dropped more bombs
on Hamburg in one weekend
than fell on London
in the whole of the war.
That's different.
Yeah.
Thank you, Barker.
Colonel Morgan.
- Welcome.
- Herr Lubert.
Please come inside.
Let me show you the house.
This is my wife, Mrs. Morgan.
How do you do?
- After you, Mrs. Morgan.
- Thank you.
The finest room of the house.
It's lovely,
isn't it, darling?
It's very modern.
Yes, it is.
That's a Steinway.
- An excellent instrument.
- Yes.
Do you play?
Actually,
I've rather let it slip.
Well, it will be good
to have it played again.
What was up there before?
A painting.
It was damaged.
I haven't replaced it yet.
So the main staircase is
this way.
Our library.
Herr Lubert's an architect.
Was.
Now I'm a metal press operator.
Shall we?
Die Elbe.
It flows all the way
to the, uh...
I'm sorry,
I don't have the English.
The Deutsche See?
- North Sea.
- The North Sea, yes.
It's all the same sea
in the end.
Indeed.
It's cold.
Can we go in?
I hope you can be
as happy here as we were.
My daughter and I
will stay out of your way
until we move to the camp.
Thank you.
You should
have told me, that's all.
What?
Thinking of our honeymoon.
My God.
You look beautiful.
You've still got this.
Of course.
You're smoking?
Dr. Mayfield said that it
would help with my nerves.
And has it?
The cabin, you remember?
With its leaky roof.
- It rained for two weeks.
- It did.
And, my God, that cold.
You burnt my books.
Well, I had to.
I had no choice.
It was Agatha Christie.
You might have waited
until I found out who did it.
- The butler.
- The butler always did it.
Mm-hmm.
Happy times.
Good.
The governor's here.
Wilkins.
Sir.
They were hit delivering
food to the camp, sir.
A grenade, I believe.
Two of ours dead.
Bloody looters
are making it worse.
Back!
Get them back!
- Push them back!
- Come on, move.
Get them off!
Christ.
The breath on these people.
Yes, well, that's what
900 calories a day
does to you.
Well, at least they're less
trouble when they're hungry.
Keith Burnham,
Divisional Intelligence.
So what have we got?
- Is that him?
- That's the fella.
Looks like Werwolves. 88s.
Nazi bastards
who won't accept we've won.
Captain, can we have
these two boys taken care of?
Absolutely.
A medic!
Wilkins, get a medic.
Yes, sir!
Thought so. 88.
Heil Hitler.
Private.
Get our men on the truck.
And somebody bag this one up.
Oh. Hello.
You must be Freda.
What were you reading?
Freda.
She never listens.
I'm only her father.
I'm sorry, I... I don't...
Sorry, emergency.
Ooh, I see you have coffee.
Yeah, I'd... I'd prefer tea.
They don't really do tea.
I'll rustle some up
from the NAAFI.
- Coffee it is, then.
- No.
Sleep well?
Actually, I did.
Good.
That's really good.
I'm looking forward
to it being just us.
What?
Uh...
What if we let them
stay on?
The staff? Do we need them?
The Luberts.
So you mean...
Live with them?
I mean, they'd be
on the top floor.
Rach, we'd hardly notice
they're here.
- Is everyone doing it?
- Here.
It's not the same. No one else
has a house like this.
This isn't what we wanted.
The big house, the staff,
the art on the walls.
I know.
I thought we were going
to be together.
We are together.
Alone.
I...
I'm not comfortable with it.
With them.
Not comfortable with them
because they're Germans.
It's chaos out there, Rachael.
There's nowhere to put
these people.
There's nowhere to...
Nothing to feed these people.
There's...
It does... It makes no sense
to throw the Luberts out.
You didn't tell me
what I was walking into.
This isn't how
it was supposed to be.
None of this is how
it is supposed to be.
And yet here we are.
Thank you.
- I'm very grateful.
- You're very welcome.
Thank you.
Sorry. Uh...
Could, um...
Could one of you
help me, please?
I want to move the plants.
The plants?
They're blocking the light.
You don't like the chair?
It's a Mies van der Rohe.
"The house
of construction."
It's meant to be one of
the most comfortable chairs
ever invented.
Well, it isn't.
It's ugly.
He was of the Bauhaus school.
Their philosophy was
all about rejecting
unnecessary adornment.
Do you really need
a philosophy
to make something
comfortable?
Well, behind every object,
there is a philosophy,
isn't there?
Herr Lubert, please don't
creep about the house.
I thought we agreed
to keep to our own quarters.
Our "zones."
Yes, of course.
I will try to remember.
And if your daughter
wants anything from her room,
I'll get Heike
to bring it up to her.
This is all very new to her.
All the same.
- I will make words with her.
- Have words.
- Sorry?
- In English, you don't
"make" words with someone.
You should have these.
As the lady of the house.
Delicious, Heike.
Danke schon, really.
Danke, Frau Morgan.
Look, she's doing it again.
She's smirking.
Because you said
she was delicious.
- I was making an effort.
- I know.
I don't know
how you do it.
What?
You go on like before,
all your little rituals.
Get up, shave.
Have a meal, go to work.
- Like nothing had changed.
- Please, Rachael.
I don't think it's healthy
to talk this way.
- No?
- No.
Oh.
No? How... How am I expected
to talk?
You might like
to set an example.
When did you get to be
so self-righteous?
Come on.
Let's have that tea.
I don't know when he got
to be so sanctimonious.
You stifle under the weight
of all that decency.
Lawrence of Hamburg,
Keith calls him.
The one who went queer
for the natives.
He actually seems
to like Lubert.
Lew let them stay on.
Is that wise?
There may not be
an outward show of hatred,
but it's there
below the surface.
Be careful, that's all.
They're not like us.
Good afternoon.
Freda.
It's fine.
Please forgive her,
Mrs. Morgan.
She should have asked
permission.
- It's all right.
- It's not.
- She plays well.
- She plays very badly.
She never practices.
Claudia despaired of her.
Claudia?
Her mother.
My wife.
Oh.
Is she somewhere
in the house too?
She died in the firestorm.
I'm so sorry.
Um...
If Freda wants to play,
I don't see why not.
In the afternoons,
for half an hour or so, I...
I thought we agreed
to keep to our "zones."
You'll be paid
in food vouchers
- for your work, given a meal...
- Freda.
...and brought
back home before dark.
Are you 16?
Bodies!
Bodies here!
All right, stand back.
Get them away
from it, Tom, will you?
Not a bad way to go...
One last screw
before lights out.
- Come.
- Back to work, you lot.
Bag up these bones.
Forgive me for intruding.
It's freezing upstairs.
I cut some firewood earlier.
- Do you mind if I...
- No, not at all.
No need to ask permission.
We're going out this evening,
but can I get you a drink?
No, thank you.
Well then. Good night.
Good night.
- Still got it.
- Keith won't be long.
- We're so glad you could come.
- Thank you.
Well, it's good
to finally meet you
and a relief to be
out of the house.
What a house, though.
It's almost worth
living with a German.
It's so funny.
You've got one, too.
A missing painting.
We have one just like it.
Everyone does.
It's where
they would have hung him.
Who?
The Fuhrer.
"The stain
that can't be removed."
They're usually clever enough
to cover them up.
Hmm.
Sorry to keep you. Apologies.
Thank you.
Based on their answers,
we assign them a category
from black to white.
They're clean,
they get their Persilschein,
their laundry ticket.
It's the certificate
allowing them to return
to a normal life.
Does Lubert have
his Persilschein?
Does it matter?
Yes.
I think I have the right
to know if I'm living
with a Nazi.
Yes, I think it does matter.
I don't think
you can judge a person
by his answers
to a questionnaire.
No? How do you judge him?
You look him in the eye.
- Lubert was never in uniform.
- That's not the point.
Well, there was no blood
on his hands.
There's blood
on all their hands.
Honestly, Lew,
I sometimes wonder whose side you're on.
Even after everything
that they've done...
The war is over.
We won.
That's the end of it.
Let's have dessert
in the drawing room.
Well, does he or not?
Not yet.
It's a formality.
Shall we?
Morning, sir.
Papers, ma'am.
Papers.
There you are.
Papers, sir.
So you were building houses
for Nazi officials.
After 1933, we built
what we were told to build.
Did the bombing affect
the health of you
and your family?
It's a simple question.
It affected the health
of my wife.
She was one
of the 40,000 killed
when British bombers
razed this city to the ground.
July 27th, 1943.
Well, let's talk
about your wife.
The money was hers?
Her family was wealthy, yes.
They owned a number
of shipping yards.
Shipping yards used
to transfer Nazi weapons?
Among many other things.
You have to understand
that my wife and I
had nothing to do
with her family business.
Yet you claim to never
have joined the Nazi Party?
I was against everything
the Nazis stood for.
That wasn't my question.
No.
I was never a party member.
Did you know
about the camps?
No.
So you've never seen these?
Here.
Have a look.
One last question.
During the war, did you ever
hope for a German victory?
You answered,
"I wanted it to end."
I wanted to go back
to how it was.
What, you miss the past?
Is that it?
I miss my wife.
All right.
You'll hear from us
in due course.
Herr Lubert?
Herr Lubert?
Could you come
in here, please?
Could you explain this?
It's a von Guerard.
I'm not asking what it is.
I'm asking
what it's doing here.
You objected to the stain,
so I covered it.
What's the matter,
don't you like it?
That's not the point.
What's it covering?
Does it offend you?
He was German,
maybe that offends you.
It was a picture of him,
wasn't it?
- Of him?
- Your Fuhrer.
It's simple for you.
The war ends.
You go home the winner.
- Your conscience is clear.
- Oh.
Is your conscience
not clear?
I thought you would like
the painting.
I apologize if I was mistaken.
Would you object
to a landscape?
A nice hunting scene perhaps?
- I object to your tone.
- Then throw us out!
- Herr Lubert.
- Throw us out.
You hate us.
It's what you want.
- Throw us out.
- Nobody said anything about...
We can leave you alone
to fight with your husband,
when he bothers to be here.
I think you've said enough.
Then throw us out.
Here. I'll give you a reason.
I think you should go.
What do you think?
- It's stunning.
- Idiot.
- Me?
- I meant the table.
Burnham at the head
or next to Susan?
Let's just keep him
away from the alcohol.
Just don't argue with him.
- Mm-hmm.
- Be English.
Talk about the weather.
What are you doing?
I was just admiring
your dress.
Oh.
Thinking how lucky I am.
Do you like it?
You ought to,
it took me long enough.
I'm imagining...
what you look like out of it.
When do our guests arrive?
Not for an hour.
- Not for an hour.
- Uh-uh.
Hmm.
You are...
Go upstairs.
Lock the door.
What is it?
There's a protest
at headquarters.
I'm sorry, my love, but...
Well, you'll have to entertain
the guests until I get back.
Go on, then.
Go and save Germany.
Don't be like that.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Wish me luck.
Feed us! Feed us! Feed us!
Captain.
They've barricaded
the street, sir.
They're not letting
anybody in or out.
I want
this street closed off.
Captain, tell the men
there is to be no firing.
Break through!
We need more men!
Get back!
Hey! Hey, hey!
Back!
Sir. Sir, where are you going?
Get back!
No firing. No firing!
- It's outrageous. A clergyman?
- A chance to rebuild.
What choice have we got?
Thank you, Heike.
We've done them a favor.
Now it's time to leave.
We're talking about war.
Nobody really wins, do they?
There's nothing
left for us here.
French got the wine.
Yanks got the view.
What, we got the ruins?
And what does
Herr Lubert think?
I don't know.
You'd have to ask him.
Well, I must say,
this is good hock.
Thank Herr Lubert.

Lubert, Lubert...
Steady on.
All right, all right.
Sorry about the glass,
old boy.
Stefan.
Well done.
I'm so sorry.
What for?
I'm the one
who should apologize.
Good night.
Good night.
That's not necessary.
You've got grit in it.
This is going to hurt.
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I don't think so.
I was going to apologize.
For what?
Don't.
I was going to...
but I won't.
Rachael.
Stop.
Everything all right?
Uh...
What happened to you?
I was caught up in a protest.
You were at the protest?
Not by choice.
Then you know what happened.
Bloody people tried
to kill me.
I mean, what is the matter
with this country?
You don't realize
we're here to help?
I should go.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm sorry. How was the party?
Fine.
I'm tired.
I'm going to go up.
All right.
I'll be up in a bit.
Ah. Freda.
Listen, do you have
something of mine? Yes?
My wife gave it to me.
There are photographs in there,
and I would like it back.
Perhaps you've seen it?
Freda, I...
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
Sir.
There's been an attack.
Bomb, sir.
In the Russian zone.
Oh, Christ.
It's only for a few days.
I'll be back in time
for Christmas.
Well, where are you going?
I could come with you.
I'm sorry, no.
"This is the army,
Mrs. Jones."
Yes.
I'll make it up to you,
I promise. Hmm?
I suppose
I should be used to it.
Six days.
Sorry?
I asked.
I checked.
They'd have given you
six days leave
after the funeral...
and you didn't take it.
Why didn't you take it?
I asked myself that
and I had a lot of time
to think about it.
- Please.
- And then I thought, why...
"Maybe he just doesn't...
- Rach.
- "...feel it like I do."
- He wasn't there.
- No.
There was a war on.
I had a job to do.
What did I have?
Nothing.
What is it you want from me?
Lewis...
I want him back.
I can't do that for you.
Lewis. Lewis. Please.
I'm asking you.
I'm begging you.
Please don't go.
I'm going out.
- Sir.
- Barker.
Michael could never manage
that bit, either.
Michael.
My son.
He died in the war.
A bomb hit our house
on July the 2nd, 1942...
and killed him.
He was 11.
He'd be about your age
right now.
He used to come home
from school.
He'd have...
He'd have ink
all over his hands.
I'd have to spend hours...
He'd get it all over the keys.
And I don't...
I don't think I can,
um...
I don't know if I can,
um...
I don't...
...think I can cope.
Because...
I should have stopped him.
I should have...
I was his mother.
I was his mother.
I can't...
I can't...
I couldn't...
- I can't bear it.
- Freda.
I can't bear
I can't...
I can't bear it.
It's all right.
I can't.
Mrs. Morgan.
I wondered if you'd like
to join me for breakfast.
Both of you.
We would like that very much.
I have somebody coming over
tomorrow to do my hair,
if Freda would like
to join me.
Freedie?
- Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.
- Why?
What's wrong with my hair?
Come in.
Herr Lubert. Frau Morgan.
Will you need me
this afternoon?
No, thank you, Greta.
That will be all.
These were your men.
Do you have
the man responsible?
I'd like to see him.
Siegfried Leitman,
former SS Sturmbannfuhrer.
- Yes, I do.
- Good.
This boy.
Do you know him?
- No.
- Come on.
Come on.
You wear the same mark.
There are many of us
with that mark.
Then give me their names.
Why would I do that?
Colonel, this man
still has his bootlaces on.
An oversight.
He might have hanged himself.
But you didn't, did you?
Because you're a coward.
And you send children
to do your killing.
Yes. They make
the best killers.
They don't question it.
And you don't have the stomach
for handling them.
That's where you're wrong.
See, I killed
younger than this.
When the war was on, before
the bureaucrats took over,
I killed every German
I got my hands on.
- Yes.
- Because I wanted it to end.
You are murderers too.
You think we have forgotten?
You are like a child
who covers his eyes
and thinks
the world goes away.
But we won't forget.
We will cut your men's throats
in the streets.
We will burn your women
in their homes.
We will bomb your children
while they are sleeping
in their beds.
Colonel Morgan.
- You want it?
- Nein!
Now, give me their names.
I'm so sorry.
No.
We're nearly there.
It's still freezing.
I actually can't feel my toes.
Oh, that's not good.
Let me check.
What are you doing?
- I'm just checking.
- Stop it.
- Stop it.
- Yep, still here.
So are your feet.
- Stop it.
- Ankles, yep. Calves.
And your thighs.
Before the war,
I bought some land
in the Alps.
Near Oberstdorf.
It's not much now,
just a cabin,
a bit like this one.
Warmer, I hope.
I'm going to build a house.
Something very modern.
Just one floor...
set into the hillside...
with steel beams
and a glass wall
facing the beautiful
pine trees.
You can ski to the front door.
What do you think?
Could you live in it?
I don't know how to ski.
You're smiling.
- I smile all the time.
- Hardly ever.
Not since you came here.
I like you like this.
I never thought that I could be
happy like this again.
Then come with us.
You don't have your papers.
How will you travel?
They will clear me.
It's just a matter of time.
This is Stunde Null.
The Zero Hour.
Everything can start again.
I let him get to me. Leitman.
I shouldn't have.
- He murdered children, sir.
- Hmm.
If it was me,
I would have loaded the gun.
You would have loaded
the gun?
Yeah.
No, you wouldn't have.
Yeah. No, I wouldn't.
Dad always said I lack
the spine to be a soldier.
Yes.
Then I think your dad
probably gave you a compliment.
It's not the war
that makes men of us.
I've done things
I'm certainly not proud of.
I often wonder, my wife...
if she knew...
how she'd feel about me.
Let's get out of this
bloody cold and go home.
Rachael.
Sorry I'm late.
Now, what's all this about?
I need a favor.
It's taking a long time
to clear Lubert.
What's your secret?
- What?
- Something's changed.
Oh, it's my hair.
I had it done.
No. Mmm.
Something else.
It's Christmas.
I've always liked Christmas.
Really?
I can't stand it.
Not Christmas
without children.
Oh, is the teddy bear
for the girl?
- Yes.
- And...
The cigars?
- For my husband.
- When he gets back?
Yes. For when he gets back.
Well, I suppose
I could ask Keith
what's taking so long
to clear him.
If you're going
to spy on a girl,
the least you could do
is pay her a compliment.
Hello, Rach.
I'm home.
Lewis.
Is Lubert around?
Uh...
I think he's in the garden.
- Why?
- He should join us.
I'm going to clean up.
I have some news.
Oh.
What are we celebrating?
I've been offered a new post.
Ah.
Your trip was successful?
Successful? Well, um...
Let us see, shall we?
Herr Morgan?
Shall I prepare supper?
That won't
be necessary, Greta.
We're going out to
a regimental dinner tonight.
But you can please join us
for a glass of champagne.
Come on. Come in and join us.
A second Christmas.
Shall we say a Russian one.
A post? Where?
The War Office.
London.
We're going home.
So?
I've been cleared.
I knew it.
Congratulations. Burnham
must have pulled some strings.
- That's really wonderful.
- Yes, it is.
I, um... I don't understand.
You haven't finished
your work here.
Well, I put in a request.
I didn't want to tell you.
I didn't want you
to get your hopes up.
But we're going home.
Hmm?
So, from both of us,
I'd like to say thank you,
and to new beginnings.
Bertie?
Bertie?
Bertie.
Right.
Sorry.
This dress, it isn't right.
What are you doing?
He's downstairs.
Just tell him.
Tell him you're leaving
with me tonight.
- I can't.
- Then I will.
No, it has to come from me.
- It's the same dress.
- What?
Oh.
Yes.
My love.
Sir.
Rachael!
- Lew.
- Yes?
We need to talk.
Colonel.
Just a minute.
- General.
- How are you?
Good, good.
How are you?
You know
you'll be wasted in Whitehall.
Well, you're leaving this city
in better shape
than you found it.
Cheers.
Glad to be of service.
Sir.
Rachael.
Oh, Rachael.
Is it true?
- What?
- You're really leaving?
Won't you miss it?
What will she miss?
- The staff?
- The people.
Hmm.
I must say,
I'm surprised at you, Morgan.
For what?
I thought you'd prefer
to handle the matter yourself.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Ah, don't play innocent.
If you're so bloody convinced
Lubert's clean,
don't send your wife
to press his case for you.
Do you really want
to go back to London rationing?
I'm sure
Lewis would forgive you
if you did choose to stay.
Susan.
Ladies. Excuse me.
Would you mind
if I borrowed my wife?
Please.
Tell me I'm wrong.
What I'm thinking...
Tell me I'm losing my mind.
Lewis...
I'm so sorry.
How long?
- No, not here.
- I was gone a few days.
How long have you
been fucking him?
- Don't do this.
- I want to know.
Why? What difference
does it make?
I want to know the moment
our marriage was over.
It's been over for years,
ever since Michael died.
Don't you dare
bring him into this.
Everything changed
when he died.
Why can't you admit it?
You left me.
- It's my fault.
- No, no.
It's mine.
Why can't you just say it?
Say it.
You blame me
for letting him die.
Take me home.
Please, can you take me home?
Just get in. Get in the car.
Get in the car.
Give me the keys.
- Give me the keys.
- Here they are, sir.
Rachael, get down.
Rachael, hold on.
- Oh, dear God.
- Rachael, are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?
- Lewis.
I'm going after him.
- Lewis, Lewis.
- It was two shots.
- Stay in the car.
- Just...
Hey!
I will fire! Stop!
Bertie?
Stop or I will fire!
I will shoot!
You have nowhere to go!
Albert!
Freda, no.
It's too late.
Albert!
Help me! Help me!
Albert!
Come on.
Just stay with me.
Stay with me.
Take him.
Papa!
I should never
have brought you here.
Can't blame you...
for wanting to start again.
Huh?
Lewis?
Are you all right?
How is she?
She's sleeping.
He knows.
Good.
We should leave
in the morning.
Just go.
How did it happen?
Was he in pain?
He was caught in the blast.
It was instant.
Yeah.
You know,
I never wanted to leave you.
I had to.
You know, I see his face...
every time I look at you.
When you laugh, I...
h-h-hear his voice.
I...
When I...
Every time I touch you, I...
I smell him on your skin.
You're the best part
of me, Rachael.
You always will be.
Rachael?
Ready?
Rachael?
No, no, no, no, no.
You're coming
with me.
I need you.
We needed each other.
But this is, this is
what you wanted.
To start again.
I do.
I do.
Forgive me.
Rachael.
Papa!
Papa!
