[sombre orchestral music plays]
[operatic chorus plays]
[woman on TV] ...continue to bring you
any updates as and when they happen.
The atmosphere here is tense, as we come
to you live from the police station
situated within the Athena council estate.
This is the third case
of police misconduct
to rock the country
in less than two months.
[camera shutters click]
The Ministry of the Interior
is yet to comment on the situation.
[breathes shakily]
We've just left the bureau
of Captain Landrieux.
My brother died at 00:30 during the night.
[sighs] At present, the identities
of the police in the video are unknown.
The Inspectorate General has assured us
the investigation
will be thorough and determined.
And that, once identified,
the culprits will know justice.
In memory of Idir,
my little brother,
I implore you to stay calm.
Tomorrow, a silent walk will be planned.
Merci.
[man] Merci, Abdel.
It is completely unacceptable to imagine
that the police force
is protecting their colleagues
and pretending not to be aware
who is responsible for this
here, on the Athena estate,
where everyone knows each other.
I implore the justice system
to do everything within its powers
to not only identify, but to arrest
the criminal police officers responsible.
I ask this in the name of one
of our great families here in France.
A family that has repeatedly
fought for our country.
The grandfather of Idir
was one of our Algerian Fusiliers.
Abdel himself has just returned from Mali
where his fighting
has earned him several medals.
At the request of Idir's mother
and his brothers,
a complaint will be filed
within the next few hours
detailing the inadequate resources
given to this investigation...
[shouting and screaming]
Oh shit! Run!
Move!
Stop! What are you doing?
You can't go in there! No!
- Get back!

We are the police!

Then pack it to go.
It comes with us. Hurry up.
And make sure you take it all,
even the helmets. Take all of it!

Oi, Karim! Come on.
I found the way to the car park.

Oi, come on. Bring out the safe!
Come on. Let's go!
Bring it. Bring it!

Hey! Go, go, go! Hurry up.
Get it through here!
Come on, come on
Let's go! Quickly! Let's go, let's go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oi, as soon as they get here,

Hey, that's it, come on!
Let's go, let's go!
[man] Wait for me, wait for me!
- Go on, go!

Go on, go!
Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!

- Fuck you!
- Yeah! Fuckers!
- Yeah, you fuckers!

- [crowd roars]
Come on, let's go. We'll see you later.
Let's go to the estate! Athena!
Fuck! Fuck you! Yeah!
Fuck the police! Fuck the police!
[all cheer and yell]
Go, Athena!
[siren wails]
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Athena!
That's how it's done! Just like that!
Aah! Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Come on!
[crowd cheering]
- Oi, let's go, let's go!
- Come on, man.
Oi, take this. Take this, hurry up!
All of you, off! Quickly!
Come on! Go to B3 with the others, go on.
[speaking French] Wait, got a smoke?
[Karim] Not now, Zinzin, not now.
[yells in mix of Arabic and French]
Hey, we're gonna fuck this shit up!
Take this, take this.
- Yeah!
- I'm gonna fuckin' burn all your shit.
- Yeah!
- Oi, Rachid, tell them we're gonna arrive.
Make the call. Make it, yeah?
- All right. Relax, calm.
- Call him, man, call him.
- Go on, man.
- Let me call him.
We're nearly there, guys! Get ready!
- Yo!
- [Karim] Come on! Let's go!
- Over here, yeah?
- Yo, bruv, Fifou's not pickin' up.
- What do you mean, not pickin' up?
- What the fuck? He's not answerin'!
- Oi, yeah, yeah, yeah! Higher!
- Let's go, man.
[laughter]
Oi! Hey, pull off right! On the right!
[objects crashing]
- Tell them it's us! It's us in the van!
- I can't...
[Karim] I don't give a fuck!
Tell them it's us! Are they fuckin' dumb?
Fuck!
It's us in the van, you fuckin' dickheads!
Drive that round the back and burn it.
[Fifou] It's Karim, it's Karim! Stop it!
- Open the fuckin' gates! Open 'em!
- [siren blaring]
Come on, come on, come on. Go!
[Fifou laughs] Fuckin' sweet, man!
Even the siren works.
Oi, check it out, I got the tracksuits
for everyone. The same ones.
Oi! With these tracksuits,
we're like an army.
They're gonna go fuckin' mental.
It's our uniform.
They'll see a load of us dressed the same,
but they won't know who's who.
We nicked 'em
from the football club earlier.
Ouss!
Tell them to keep goin' with that shit.
- We need to build it up. Build more of it.
- Look.
We nicked some walkies too,
from the buildin' site next door.
- [walkie beeps]
- We're a real team now, yeah?
Like an army! Check it out.
There's, like, 30 of 'em here.
Look, they're fresh.
Still see the packets.
Yeah, yeah, I believe you. Come on.
I'll look at it later when I've got time.
[woman] We can't take it any more!
You won't leave us in peace!
We can't take it any more!
- Karim... We're so sorry for your loss.
- Merci, very kind, Madame Sangaré.
But go back to your flat,
shut all your windows and don't come out.
It's important you don't come out.
- What you stoppin' for?
- Hear what he said?
Take it down to the cellar!
What did I say to you?
Come on, take the safe down.
We'll bring power saws.
- Ouss, you ready, or what?
- Aim at my body, not my head, you prick.
- Let's go!
- Yeah, yeah. Let's test drive this shit.
Live and direct in the front line
of Athena. We ain't no bitches.
We fucked the police station up.
We violated these motherfuckers.
And right now, here's a little demo
of the gear we robbed from that shithole.
- [chanting]
- Here, take it, yeah?
You still filmin', yeah?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Yeah! You wanna fucking see this, yeah?
One... two...
- Come on!
- [all cheer]
Yes, son! You all good, yeah?
- All right? That was fuckin' sick, bruv.
- [all] Athena! Athena!
- You liked it, yeah?
- Back up, you fuckin' idiot!
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Athena! Athena! Athena! Athena! Athena!
- What the fuck you doin'?
- What's goin' on here?
- [chanting stops]
- You think it's time to piss around?
Until those pigs are nicked, it's war.
- Just wastin' time here.
- Come on, you heard him!
- Follow!
- Let's go! Come on! Come on!
[yelling continues]
[sombre orchestral music plays]
[speaking French]
Merci, merci.
[operatic chorus singing in Greek]
[orchestral music climaxes]
How old are they?
They're four.
Just about.
You should put your gloves on.
[man] Right, lads.
- You've been given the plans.
- [velcro rips]
On these plans, you can see
the main buildings of the Athena estate.
The architecture is simple.
It's built around a courtyard.
A tunnel goes directly under the estate,
so traffic has been stopped.
All the entrances to the courtyard
are blocked off by barricades.
Our first objective
is to weaken these barricades
in order to launch
a synchronised attack this evening.
It's highly likely the rioters
have got their hands on firearms.
Stay alert. Be vigilant.
- Any questions? No?
- [bus doors open]
Then let's move out!
[exhales]
[radio chatter]
- [explosion in distance]
- [men shouting]
[explosions]
[man] Coming to you live
from the Athena council estate.
The police are concerned about
the presence of Sébastien L,
a man who is currently on their watchlist,
suspected of acts of terrorism in Syria.
[woman] ...Inspectorate General
has assured us
the investigation will be
thorough and determined,
and that, once identified,
the culprits will know justice.
- [radio chatter]
- [explosions continue]
Stay in pairs as you go!
Pick up the pace!
[man in distance] Athena!
- [men chanting] Athena! Athena!
- [rioter] Athena!
- [horse snorts]
- [men chanting] Athena! Athena! Athena!
Athena! Athena! Athena! Athena!
- Athena! Athena! Athena!
- [horse whinnies]
- Athena! Athena! Athena!
- [rioter shouting] Athena!
Athena! Athena! Athena! Athena!
[rioters roaring]
[exhales]
[operatic chorus plays]
[woman] ...it's all kicking off.
Of course the kids down there
don't show any respect.
Your boys don't give a fuck about me.
[man] Oi, hurry it up, will you?
It's all goin' to shit out there.
You're the same.
You come here, you drop off your shit.
The next day, you come back,
pick it up, you don't give a damn.
You just swan in and out as you please.
Take your fuckin' shoes off!
- I tell you every time.
- Hey, Moktar?
Whatever, he's not even listening.
That's rude.
You didn't even notice
I'd put a little welcome mat
out by the front door today.
- Yeah? So where's all the rest?
- What are you sayin', the rest?
- The rest, baby. Where?
- No...
I don't know what
you're talkin' about. [gasps]
- The rest of the coke.
- In the toilet.
- That's a shit hiding place.
- [whimpers]
- Go, go check in there.
- [yelps]
- Is it in the tank, yeah?
- [whimpers]
Stealing from me? Stupid fat bitch.
Go on, hurry up!
- What you waitin' for?
- [man] Comin'!
D'you think you're on holiday, or what?
- [woman yelling] You're a fuckin'...
- [ringing tone]
- [man] Hello?
- Hello, yeah?
We'll be at the barrier,
in the ambulance.
Ask your guys to let us through,
tell 'em we're evacuatin' someone.
- Okay?
- Okay, no worries.
We'll meet up after, you know where.
- Hang on.
- Okay. Yeah.
- You mean the place where...
- [beep]
[yells]
Fuck, you scared me! Little fuck!
Ah, you lot are pissin' me off.
Go on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on, go through, yeah? Come on!
- Go on, move, move. Move it, dickhead.
- [grunts]
For fuck's sake.
What's the matter with you two?
[tyres squeal]
Keep going, hurry up!
Go on. Go on! Get in!
- Yeah, I got the spades.
- That's what I'm talkin' about! Perfect.
Come on, come on, hurry up!
Move, move, move!
[man] Okay, okay. We've got the guns.
- So where are we goin'?
- Just drive.
- [siren blares]
- The cops will let us pass through.
I told 'em we've got someone.
Then we'll bury all this in the forest,
until the estate's over this bullshit.
- This shithole is about to explode.
- [rioters yelling]
Are you fuckin' kiddin'?
What's all this? Fuck this shit!
- [door slams]
- Hey! What's all this?
Yo, Karim, your brother wants
to get through. What do I do?
[Karim on radio] I said nobody leaves!
So, are you kids gonna stop
this fuckin' around, or what? Huh?
What are you waitin' for? All the fuckin'
police in the area to turn up?
No. Just give it up.
Nobody's gettin' out...
[grunts]
- Fuck you!
- Hey, what the fuck, man?
Hey, go on, go on, get out of here.
- Get out of here! The cops are here.
- [yelling]
Go on, go on, go on, go on!
Move, move, move. Hurry up!
Head to the shisha. The cops are here.
We'll bury this shit there.
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.
Run, run, run. At the front. Run, run!
They're here! For fuck's sake, hurry up!
What are you waitin' for? Get up there.
Just speed up, will you?
Speed up at the front!
Move, move, move, move.
Fucking come on! Move!
Move. Let me past, let me past!
Shut the fuck up! Get out the way.
Get out the fuckin' way.
Let me pass! You deaf or what?
Shit, you lot. Quietly, quietly.
[grunts] Calm down! Calm...
Calm down, calm down!
Stay together. We'll just go from
one side of the courtyard to the other.
- [man] Hey, man, there's Moktar!
- [crowd] There's Moktar! Moktar!
- [man] There he is!
- They're gonna walk over.
Just keep moving, yeah?
Let's hurry up a bit.
Don't worry about 'em,
they're a bunch of pussies.
- Just fuck 'em up.
- Guys, there's Moktar!
[man in distance] What's in the bag?
Moktar, what's in the bag?
[man] Come back, come back.
Come here, come here.
- Wanna get shot up, you son of a bitch?
- [yelling]
- [man] Moktar? What are you sayin'?
- You fuckin' want some?
Let's see it, then, yeah?
- Go fuck your mum. Go fuck your mum!
- [glass smashes]
- Bastard. Pussio.
- [man] Go fuck yourself!
- You fuckin' pussy.
- Back the fuck up!
[woman yells] Your bag!
- What do you want?
- [man] Your rucksacks!
Rucksack, rucksack.
I'll get your mum in a sack! [spits]
- Get the fuck back, you little pricks!
- Relax. Back off.
Why you slowin' down?
Come on, hurry up. Up, up, up.
Hurry up. Get inside.
Nearly there, nearly there.
- Give us the fuckin' rucksacks!
- Go and open the door up!
What you sayin'? What's going on?
- [groans]
- Fuck off!
What the fuck's goin' on?
Oi, easy, all of you! Easy!
- Oi, oi, oi! Fuck you!
- Oi!
What? What?
Fuck you all!
- Come on!
- Hey!
- Oi!
- Yeah? What is it?
- What do you want?
- What you lookin' at me for?
Whose side are you on? I'm askin' you.
Fuck, bro...
Karim, Karim... You don't have
to piss around with me, Karim.
There's no point. They'll fuck you over.
You're preaching to me for real, yeah?
I'm just trying to keep
my affairs in order.
Our brother was killed
and you're chattin' biz?
Yeah, and what about it? I don't care!
You better all step back, you pussios!
Wait, what are you carrying?
Are these guns?
- [man] Check the rucksacks!
- Hey!
- [fires gun]
- Who are you trying to impress here? Huh?
- Get out my face.
- Who? Give me the guns and that'll be it.
- All good.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Man, fuck you. Shh!
- [man] Give us the rucksack!
- Oi, give us the rucksack!
- Hey, Moktar, I'm bein' serious!
- The guns, for the last time!
- All at once!
- [radio bleeps]
- Karim, the cops are coming!
You lot go over there! Go over there!
The roof of Block 7.
I'm warning you, you piece of shit.
We're not done here.
[man speaking Arabic]
[all speaking Arabic]
The youths are on fire,
and fire's put out with water.
I propose we go outside and ask for calm.
But a fire turns into a burning blaze,
and then what do we do?
Sheikh, these individuals
threw a Molotov down the hallway.
A fire broke out which we quelled,
by the grace of God.
- Alhamdulillah.
- [all] Alhamdulillah.
- We should evacuate the families.
- Brother, the lion calms the cub.
But the cubs have grown too ferocious!
Stop with the metaphors!
What are we doing here?
- [distant explosion]
- What must happen before you understand?
They are completely off the rails!
They struck me in the head
with an iron bar!
They made a hole in my skull.
They broke into the police station
and took all the weapons out.
And we do what? Wait for something else?
For someone to lose their life?
- Brothers, we have to get out.
- Calm down, brother.
- We understand you.
- Evacuating's ridiculous.
We have thousands.
What about those who won't go?
Let them stay! You'd have to be crazy
to want to stay in this quagmire.
- Calm down, please.
- [distant explosions]
- [speaks Arabic]
- But it's to him we should be speaking.
His brother's their guru,
but he doesn't get any respect.
- They're a family of violence!
- Nobody touches my brother.
- Find him. Bring him to me. That's it.
- [Imam] That's enough. Calm down.
Brother Abdel. Do you propose we evacuate?
We're taking advice
from oppressors now, are we?
- Yeah, evacuate the fragile as a priority.
- [distant clamouring]
And I'll find Karim. And we'll speak. Mm?
You better.
[Imam] We also need to find Sébastien
and isolate him
to make sure he doesn't
put anyone else in danger.
My brothers, spread between the buildings.
We'll start evacuating the families
with the utmost calm.
[man] Come on, we're evacuating.
[Imam] On the way, if you see
any youngsters, take them along with you.
[man] Block 9, brothers,
that's where we're needed.
- Let's go straight there.
- [Imam] Saber?
Help Abdel find his little brother.
And if you find Sébastien,
see to it that he leaves here.
- It's important. Okay?
- [pats arm]
[distant explosion]
[rioters yell]
- Let's make a start with block 4.
- [Saber] Okay, I've got my scooter.
[glass smashes]
[gunshot]
[ringing tone]
[explosion]
This is Karim. Leave a message.
[Abdel] Let me off here.
- Go and see if he's round the back.
- Yeah. I'll be back.
Karim!
Karim! Karim!
Stop fucking shooting!
They'll shoot more than you can.
Where is Karim?
How the fuck would I know?
Take those fuckers down! Go, go!
That's enough!
Stop shooting!
We're evacuating the families. Fuck!
[screaming]
Karim!
- You can't stay here.
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, keep going.
- [woman shouting in Arabic]
- Karim!
- [shouting continues]
Madam, get back from there!
Come down, yeah?
- You see him?
- No, no.
Block 7.
The kids, the kids! Follow the kids!
[men] Slow down, slow down!
[Abdel] Stop, stop.
Is Sébastien down there?
[Saber] What do we do?
- [Abdel] Let's go, come on.
- [rioter] Come on, let's go.
[rock music from earphones]
[Abdel] Sébastien?
- [singing softly]
- Sébastien!
Hey. We're finding somewhere quiet to take
the families. You should come as well.
[loud explosion]
- Pick him up, come on.
- Get up.
Please.
It's all good.
Let's go.
- [rioters yelling]
- [explosion]
- Come on, this way.
- No.
No, no, no, no! The crèche, Saber!
[grunts]
That's enough, stop!
Families are coming through!
Move on!
[rioter yells]
[Abdel] Sébastien! Sébastien!
[woman screams]
[Abdel] Wait, wait, come this way.
- Keep going!
- Get out!
- Go on!
- [children scream]
[Abdel] Come on.
You've gotta go. Please, hurry.
[Saber] You have to leave, madam. Quickly.
- Hey, no...
- [babbling]
- [Abdel] Is anyone still in there?
- No, not any more.
- Here. Sit down, yeah.
- [plays music on earphones]
You'll be fine here.
We'll come and get you.
Saber, close the curtains.
- [distant explosion]
- [Saber] I'll lock the back door.
- [Abdel] Stay with him.
- [Saber] Fine.
[Abdel] I'm gonna see if Karim's at home.
Don't let him leave!
[doors close and lock]
[explosion]
- [rioters yelling]
- Let's go!
Hey, you can't be here.
What are you doing?
- We're evacuating everyone..
- [women murmuring]
You can't stay here.
[man] So sorry to hear about...
We're so sorry for your loss.
[woman] Peace be with you, brother.
[man] Condolences.
[man] If we can help, let us know.
Peace to you and your family.
[woman] So sorry.
Abdel, please, if you need anything...
- [man] Hey, Abdel.
- [woman] We got you, man.
- [woman] Love, brother.
- [man prays in Arabic]
- So where's Karim?
- Why the fuck do you care?
- You're late, Abdel.
- Mama, you can't be here.
- Take this off.
- No, you...
- Go and pray.
- Mama, you can't be here. Please.
Go and pray for your little brother.
- Okay, but then we go.
- [praying in Arabic continues]
[sighs]
[mournful praying in Arabic]
[mournful praying in Arabic continues]
[mournful prayer in Arabic continues]
[calm operatic chorus plays]
- [glass smashes]
- [all gasp]
Could you please
make your way out this way?
Please, you're not safe here any more.
Can you help me? Help me.
Evacuate, evacuate. Remain calm.
- It's too dangerous.
- [distant explosions]
Okay, okay. Leave, leave, leave.
Evacuate quickly, but calmly.
[fireworks crackle outside]
[muffled explosions]
[sighs]
[cutlery clattering]
Where's Karim? Huh?
Where's Mama?
Answer me when I'm talking to you!
With Auntie Myriam,
along with everyone else.
- Why aren't you helping her?
- Why act like you give a shit?
- It's you doing this normally.
- We can talk about this later.
- Let's go.
- I'm stayin'!
Explain. What is your problem?
Is it about obeying orders? What?
After what they did, why don't you want
everything to burn?
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Why not burn this place down?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Trust me, you don't want a fire here.
Believe me, you don't want a war,
especially not now!
[woman] Don't you understand
that the war's already started?
Fuck you! That's right, just fuck off.
Get out of here! Fuck!
[man] Hey, Abdel! Abdel!
Up here, brother.
[man] Abdel!
[man] Abdel, don't leave. Please!
You need us. Stay with us!
[calm music plays]
[man] Abdel!
Where are you going, Abdel? Stay!
[woman] You are kids! You're all idiots.
You're fucking everything up!
- What's the problem?
- [woman] Stop!
[woman] What the hell are you doing?
[man] Calm her down, please.
Hey, please calm her down.
Just... just calm down, please.
[Abdel] Excuse me.
- [woman] I want my kids...
- Look at her.
- It's all your fault this is happening!
- [woman] I'm slipping.
- You're gonna drop me.
- Excuse me. You have to wait.
- Useless bastards!
- One, two, three.
- Just fucking kids, trying to be big men!
- That's ir...
You're gonna bloody drop me!
- Help us, yeah?
- You're all fucking arseholes.
You don't even know
how to keep control of the block.
- You're men who can't even control kids.
- Merci, brother.
[woman] You need to stop playing games!
This is all on you.
- [explosion]
- [crowd clamouring]
- [chanting] Athena! Athena!
- Hey! Put the guns down!
- Down!
- [woman] That's enough!
Stop shooting!
- [gunshots]
- That's enough! Hey!
- Mum!
- Ah, Abdel. Where were you?
- I looked everywhere for you.
- Go to Auntie Myriam's until it's calm.
- Where's your brother?
- He's at Amina's, he'll be okay.
- Why isn't he leaving with us?
- There's too many.
- He'll be in the next group, okay?
- He's fragile, you know.
[sobbing] Swear you'll look after him.
[operatic chorus resumes]
Okay, okay, okay.
Go through. Let's go, let's go!
- Everyone out!
- [man] Who the fuck you pushing?
Stop pushin'! There are more people!
- [man] Evacuate!
- Do one!
- Stop pushing!
- Get out of here!
- Hey! Stay calm!
- [man] I said, leave!
[yells]
[screaming]
[woman] On the Athena council estate,
the situation is intensifying
between youths and the riot squad...
Go on, pick it up. Come on.
That's enough, let's go. To the front.
[man] Move!
Further to the left!
To the left, to the left!
To the left. Wait, wait...
Now!
You sons of bitches!
[woman] These scenes are coming to you
live from the developing situation...
[cheering]
- [chanting]
- ...landed inches from...
[officers] Shields up!
[officer] To the right! In formation!
- Shields up!
- Shields up!
- Shields up!
- Shields!
- Retreat!
- Retreat!
- Come on, retreat!
- Retreat!
- Shields!
- Shields!
- [rioter] Throw that shit at 'em!
- Through the crack!
[officer yells] Look out!
Oi, I'm pissin' all over you,
you fuckin' bitches!
Drink it, you fuckin' pigs!
Hey, you lot, I'm pissin'
on these motherfuckers for real, yeah?
Come, come!
[Karim] Oh, fuck yeah!
[screams]
Break into all the flats.
Grab what you can.
We're with you, Karim.
We're gonna fuck 'em up!
[groans]
[phone vibrates]
- [sighs]
- [bleep]
Karim? It's Mama.
I can't get hold of you.
I'm really worried. Are you okay?
Be careful, darling. Call me back. Please.
[inhales]
- [exhales]
- [lift doors open]
[man on TV] ...triggered by a video shared
thousands of times on social media
in which we clearly see 13-year-old Idir
being confronted by three police officers.
[yells in pain] Fuck's sake!
...bludgeoned, beaten to the ground,
and left for dead.
However, a dramatic turn of events
took place
during the investigation this afternoon.
According to our sources, the attackers
may not have been real police officers.
If the sources are to be believed,
they could in fact be members
of a small far-right group,
their sole aim to aggravate the tensions
of the past few weeks...
- [turns TV off]
- [drops remote control]
[operatic chorus plays]
[breathes shakily]
- [radio bleeps]
- [man] Karim?
The cops are goin' into block 1.
[sniffs]
Follow me this way, yeah?
[screaming]
- [Fifou] It's Karim!
- [rioter] Oi, back off, it's Karim!
Let him go! Back off!
[operatic chorus singing in Greek]
[Karim] Get out of here! Get out of here!
Push the bins! The bins! Push the bins!
Hey, keep pushin' 'em back!
- Retreat!
- Retreat!
Retreat! Retreat!
[screams]
[radio chatter]
[key clinks]
I'm really sorry that you got arrested.
I'm embarrassed to be here,
having to remove your handcuffs.
Let them go as well.
They were only trying to help.
Yeah, come with me.
Look, if it was up to me,
they'd already be back home.
Once they're arrested,
they can't leave without an investigation.
I issued a report.
To find out who did what.
It's a scandal,
it shouldn't have happened.
The death,
or do you mean the scandal?
- Look, let me go. I'll talk to them.
- Abdel, that's impossible.
They're locking it down.
Nobody goes in or comes out.
- [man] Boss?
- Yeah, what?
- The commander's asking for you.
- I'm on my way.
I need you to stay here. I'm not
arresting you as long as you're here.
[tense orchestral music plays]
[man] We're here to help,
from Sarcelles!
- [man] Tarterêts!
- Les Pyramides!
- Saint-Denis!
- Tremblay!
- Bosquets!
- Bobigny!
It's not about victory here.
They will return here and do it all again.
We wanna know who it was that killed Idir.
We're not a load of pussies
just settin' light to shit for no point.
[man] On social media and the news,
they're saying it might not
have been cops that killed him.
Oh yeah?
You believe the news and socials, do you?
You believe all that shit from any of 'em?
It's about proving to them it's no good
any more assuming we're the victims.
They try to fuck us up,
we fuck 'em.
Every time they kill,
we kill!
They wanna talk violence, do they?
Violence is what they'll get to see,
then, won't they?
I have a plan.
We lock up a cop in here.
Yeah.
The murderers'll
have to listen to us then.

[rioter] Oi, there!
There he is! Don't let him go, come on!
Get after him! Let's go!
I'll grab him!
Oi, where is he? Where the fuck is he?
[rioters yelling]
- [rioter] Go on, then!
- Hey, what the fuck?
[rioter] Where is he? Where is he?
- [gasping]
- [shouting fades]
[metal scraping]
[woman on TV] ...situation
continues to unfold...
A large group of young men
have barricaded themselves in
while foiling other attempts to try to...
The outburst of violence continues
and has spread out
to other neighbourhoods in France.
One question remains unanswered
around the death of little Idir.
Who are these three attackers?
Investigations are now totally focused on...

- [rioter] Hey!
- Hey, there he is!
Hey! Hey! Get back! Get back! Stop!
You lot too! Just get back
or I'll shoot you all, you hear?
Yeah? Do you hear what I'll do?
All of you!
- Yeah!
- Hit him again!
Again! Go on!
Go on! Get kicking!
[man on TV] We need to show
we'll stand absolutely firm,
and not let these hooligans
set fire to bus stops,
or even worse, set fire to cars.
[reporter] Tell us realistically
how we can do that.
[man] We give the budget
and manpower to the police
so they can put them
where they can't hurt anyone.
These are neighbourhoods where
the laws of the republic no longer apply,
where bearded men or drug dealers,
sometimes both, call the shots.
We need to get republican order back,
we need the laws of the republic
to apply once more.
We need to give them the means,
we need to rearm the police,
both morally and materially.
We need to stop putting money
into these neighbourhoods.
We've supported and paid for
some perfectly useless associations,
all to try and avoid the fire,
as you said.
But the fire is a regular sight. Why?
Because these people live
by their own rules.
These areas are not France.
[reporter] The army is one solution,
but it might not be the only one.
There's something quite shocking
about what you're saying.
You say "they", "them", "them and us".
But we are them and they are us.
- We're the same society.
- [man] Hold on. Wait...
We may live in the same country,
but we are not the same society.
- [woman] How would you feel...
- [phone vibrates]
...if you had to live
in a neighbourhood like that?
Hello?
We've been stuck in here for four hours!
Hello? How much longer
before you get here?
- [man] The estate's been locked down.
- What are you talking about?
- [man] Forget it. Nothing we can do.
- You're fucking pissing me off!
Forget about this mess? It's impossible!
Fucking bast... I wanna speak.
If the game's over for me,
it's over for you! You hear me?
My man's knee deep in a hole.
What are you talkin' about?
We're both workin' our arses off!
Fuckin' play your part!
Just as I leave here, I'll give guns
to any kids that wanna be involved.
Do you hear me?
It'll light up like Sarajevo in here,
you continue fucking with me, yeah?
Fuck you, cunt!
Fucking keep digging!
Did I ask you to stop? Huh?
Big fat fuck!
[man on TV] ...riots all over...
[Karim] Look at the camera.
For all those that have died
at the hands of the police,
we demand Idir's murderers
be identified and given life sentences.
We stand firm.
If our demands are not met...
[Abdel's boss]
Recognise where it was filmed?
[Karim] ...he dies.
[sighs]
[boss sighs]
I need to know if their location
appears on this map that we've got.
It's important that you help me, Abdel.
No more victims.
Do you wanna call your brother,
reason with him?
I know the area,
I'll bring him back from there.
Better not send in the cavalry,
or that will only make it worse.
Good. Counter-terrorism will have a word.
Just tell them the layout
and any other information,
and you'll have done all you can.
Okay. Merci, Abdel.
I assure you, we will track down
whoever did this to your brother,
whoever's responsible.
But we need time.
Do you want a coffee? [sighs]
Okay. Merci, Abdel.

[rioters yelling]
[sirens blare in distance]
Oi, where are you going?
- Don't go in there!
- Hey! Come back!
Get back! It's too dangerous! Get back!
What are you doing? Get back here!
Are you crazy? Get back!
[officers continue yelling]
- [girl] Mama, look!
- [woman] Close the window!
Come away from there!
[grunts]
[rioters shouting]
[rioter] Oi, there's a cop!
Hey! Hey, it's Abdel!
It's Karim's brother!
Yeah, it is! Look!
- Abdel, you're one of us from now on!
- [chanting] Abdel is with us!
- We're countin' on you.
- Abdel is with us!
- We ain't givin' this shit up.
- Abdel is with us!
A tooth for a tooth,
you know what I'm saying?
Abdel is with us! Abdel is with us!
- Abdel is with us!
- [shouting in distance]
[man yells]

This is Karim. Leave a message.
- [bleep]

[whirring getting louder]
[inhales]
- [metal clatters]
- Abdel, what are you doing?
- Ah! Get the fuck off, you're hurting me!
- Shut up! Shut up!
What are you doin' here? Karim!
Your brother's here! What do I do?
- Yeah, playtime's over. That's enough.
- [bullets clatter]
Do you know what
you'll get for this bullshit?
If you don't get shot,
ten years in prison.
So I'm taking the cop.
And if anyone gets in my way, I'll shoot.
[Karim] What are you doing?
- What's your name?
- Jérôme.
- [Karim] Abdel!
- Let's get you out of here.
- You'll be fine.
- [Karim] Abdel! I'm talking to you!
Didn't you hear me? You can't do this.
They're out there waitin' for this.
You're coming with me
to avoid drama.
You're the one who doesn't get it.
It's not over.
Those fuckers won't talk
no matter how hard I push.
He stays here.
[Abdel] Okay. I get it.
You're not givin' up?
What will the names mean to you? Huh?
Will it bring back Idir?
No.
What's done is done.
It won't bring him back.
He's dead.
Please, come with me.
Come with me, brother, please.
Come on. Come home.
[sighs]
Come with me.
Think of Mama, please.
Please. Poor Mama,
she's already suffered enough.
Enough, let go!
You're a puppet
and a traitor and nothin' more.
You're a harki, that's all you are!
[spits]
Don't come here actin' the big brother
when someone dies.
All you are is a pussy
in uniform for France.
You wanna hear it?
You're nothin' but a memory.
We'd have all preferred it was you,
you know. But it was Idir who died.
[breathes shakily]
I would rather that.
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Abdel!
Abdel, come back!
- Abdel!
- Keep your head down and run.
[Karim] Abdel!
To the right, here! Right!
That way, that way!
The door over there!
[door clangs]
This way, let's go!
- [Karim] Abdel!
- [banging]
Abdel!
[officer shouting through megaphone]
Police! Police! Don't move!
- [gunshot]
- [screams]
- [officer] On the ground!
- [Abdel] Stop shooting!
- We're on your side!
- [gunshots]
- Stop shooting, for fuck's sake!
- [screams]
[rioters clamouring]
Come on. Let's go.
[Zinzin yelling]
Hey, straight on!
Hey, straight on!
Open up!
It's Abdel! Come on!
Up! Up!
[Moktar] Open the door, open the door!
- [rioters roaring]
- Hey! Hey!
Hey!
[grunting]
[Moktar] Come on!
I'll shoot any of you fuckers!
Come closer, I dare you,
you little bitches!
Huh? Back off, you little pussies.
I'll fucking shoot you cunts
a new arsehole!
[Moktar yells] Aah! Come on!
Huh? Let's go!
[shouting fades]
Get the fuck out of here. Little pussies.
So, we're here. Hmm?
This is like when
you were scared after school,
and you'd come to me for protection, huh?
It's good to see you here, little brother.
I've missed you, it's been forever.
- [inhales]
- Hey.
Why won't you speak
to our little brother? Huh?
What? Have they got you
goin' crazy, or what?
Oh, you know what? Fuck that.
The way this new generation thinks,
they're fucking doomed.
[sighs] Is there a way out of here?
Oh, putain. Idir...
Idir. They took my brother away from me.
Those fuckers.
I'll never get the chance to know him.
Come here, my brother.
[sighs]
Oh, fuck. We're family.
You hear me?
We'll always be there for each other.
We'll always be, okay?
Oh, putain.
Nobody can change that.
We'll always be family, forever.
Forget about our different dads,
or this fucking war.
That's not what I'm bothered about.
We're the same flesh and blood,
me and you.
That'll always be, you hear me?
Is there another way out of here?
Yeah, there's my soldier.
Well, there's a back door, yeah,
but we blocked it off.
I'll have a look.
Who's this, then?
I swear that's the cop that was on TV.
- Yeah, that's him.
- Everyone's looking for him.
- That's him.
- He's the one on TV.
I'm finding a way to get him out.
We don't need any problems.
You brought a cop here, seriously?
[Jérôme wheezing]
[grunts]
Continue digging, you motherfucker! Go on!
Go on, you'll have to dig deeper now.
- Are you okay?
- [gasping]
Come on! Have you lost you mind, or what?
He's seen the weapons and our faces.
We're gonna have to dig deeper.
I'll shoot him, we'll bury him here.
Or you can save his life.
Then you're a hero.
Me bein' the hero, is it?
[phone ringing]
Who's calling you? Who's that?
Is that the cops? Huh?
I don't give a fuck...
[sniffs]
[mutters]
- [phone ringing]
- [sighs]
[sniffs]
[sighs] All right, let's do it.
We can do this. We'll do it
my way, so there's no fucking problem.
My cops on the inside will come
and get him, you hear me?
[digging continues]
Yeah? Yeah, hello?
Yeah, sorry about earlier.
I lost my temper, yeah?
Listen, yeah. I think I've found
a solution to our problem.
[Abdel sighs]
[Moktar] Do you and your buddies
wanna be heroes?
We'll get you out of here.
Don't worry about it.
[Moktar] How long?
- [man] I don't know, about ten minutes.
- Yeah, that works for me. All good.
[man] Okay, see you soon.
[door opens]
[Moktar] Problem solved. Huh?
You okay, big guy?
You must be hungry, huh?
You've gotta eat to be big and strong.
Have a Twix.
Go on, big guy, take it.
What? You think I poisoned it, or what?
And I've got some Yop.
Raspberry, strawberry.
The strawberry one's a bit smaller.
What do you reckon?
The little one?
You're timid, huh?
[chuckles] He's timid, huh!
Don't cry, big guy, okay?
[chuckles] God, he's like a kid.
You take care of him.
It's just like Daddy Day Care.
[helicopter hovering]
That's fucked up.
But why attack the shisha?
Your brother's in there.
They're not my brothers.
If we have to,
we'll burn it down to force them out.
[liquid sloshes]
[phone vibrating]
[sighs]
[sighs]
Hello, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
No.
Yeah, don't worry, Mama.
I'll be back home before you know it.
I'm sorry, yeah?
[sighs]
I love you, Mama.
[breathing slowly]
[helicopter circling]
Somebody take this.
You can go by the stairs.
Just smash the wall down.
I'll go round the front and distract them.
Bring me the cop.
- [woman] What about the chopper?
- I told you, I don't give a fuck.
[man] Yeah, let's go, let's go.
Let's do it.
[yells] Abdel!
[yelling] Abdel!
Let the cop out, yeah?
- Hey!
- Stop it, the riot squad will see you!
I don't give a fuck about you
or that arsehole in there!
Let 'em all come here!
I want the cop, that's all!
Karim, it's too late, though.
Get out of here now.
- Give him to me or I'll set you alight.
- Go! You have time!
- I told you, I'll burn you all in there!
- [Moktar] Come over.
Hey! Hello?
Hey! My cops are about to arrive.
- [Karim] Abdel!
- You sure? Our brother's there.
They've known me a long time.
They won't piss around.
- Tell him to go. He's fucking it up!
- You can't be here.
- Get out of here. They're on their way.
- Give him to me, or I'll set you on fire.
- [thumping and yelling]
- [Abdel] It's too late, Karim.
- You wanna see it? Huh?
- [Abdel] Hey! What are you doing?
- Whoa! Don't light that.
- [Karim] I just want the cop.
- What are you doing?
- Hand him over, or I'll set fire to him.
- [Abdel] Put that out, Karim!
- [thumping]
- [yelling]
- Abdel! Abdel! Abdel!
- Hello?
- [Jérôme] Abdel!
- Hold on a second. I'm coming!
- [Jérôme] Abdel!
- Enough, now!
- [Karim] Give him to me!
- Put it out!
- [Jérôme] Abdel!
- Abdel, it's gonna burn.
- [Abdel] Put it out, Karim!
- [rioter] Son of a bitch!
- Abdel!
[Moktar] Hey! Hey!
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
- [Karim] Don't make me do this, please.
- Let's finish this. Let's not do this.
- Abdel!
- [Abdel] Karim, put it out.
All right! I'll wait to three, yeah?
- Karim! Karim!
- [Karim] I'm gonna set you on fire!
- One!
- [Abdel] Stop this fucking bullshit!
- Two!
- No!
- Karim, don't do that!
- [Karim] Abdel, stop!
- Enough, yeah?
- Abdel, don't push me!
- [officer] Police!
- Three!
- Police! Get down!
- Drop your weapon!
- Get on the ground!
- Drop your weapon!
Drop the weapon! Stop or I'll shoot!
- Karim! Get down!
- [officer] Lie down!
- Please, get down! On the ground, Karim!
- [officer] Stop! Police!
- Stay right there!
- Go on!
- [grunting]
- [helicopter hovering]

No!

[helicopter circling]

[cries]
[strains]
[sobs]
[Moktar] Come on, be strong, brother. Huh?
It wasn't your fault.
We have to get rid of the guns.
It's too dangerous.
Too many kids. We gotta go.
We have to leave here.
You can save them all.
[grunts]
[both grunting]
[Moktar wheezing]
[grunting]
[yelling]
[groaning and yelling]
[sighing]
If you don't wanna be here...
[sighs]
...time to go.
Leave your weapons.
[sniffs]
[exhales sharply]
Search the whole building.
Kick down the walls to get through.
And collect the weapons.
Close the shutter.
[Fifou] You son of a bitch! Yeah?
[Rachid] Fucking pussy!
Fucking little cunt!
- Piece of...
- You're a little scumbag!
- Shut up!
- We'll cut your fingers off!
- You fucking pussio!
- Filthy motherfucker!
You pathetic little bitch!
- Cut his fingers off to fuck him up!
- I didn't do anything!
- It wasn't me!
- Shut your mouth!
- [phone rings]
- Fuck, man. Shut it, yeah?
[Abdel's boss] Abdel!
Abdel, what's going on?
I told you not to fucking move!
Listen, it was some cowboys
from the local Anti-Crime Squad
who tried to do an intervention.
We didn't send them in.
I must have proof
the officer is still alive.
Listen, Abdel, I know it's awful,
but everyone is on edge.
[hangs up]
All right. Take him upstairs.
Didn't you hear what he said?
Go! Turn right!
- Now move!
- [Fifou] Get out of the way!
[Rachid] Here. hold this, hold this.
[thumping and yelling]
[dramatic music playing]
[officer shouting through megaphone]
[helicopter circling]
[Rachid] Here we go.
[rioter] Oh, shut up.
[Ouss] Abdel! Abdel!
Fuck, you gotta come with me, now.
We've got a problem. Come on. Come on!
[breathing heavily]
It's right here, right here.
What do we do with him? Huh?
[door opens]
[man] We blocked off the underground area,
but we couldn't crack this.
[sternly] Help them do it.
Get me all the fireworks, gas cylinders
and petrol you can get hold of.
And you, sister.
Go and get me a fruit juice.
Go on.
[rioter] Come on, let's go!
[Rachid] See how you fucked everything up?
You are gonna pay for it.
- You're gonna fucking pay for it!
- [ringing tone]
Now we're gonna burn down
all your neighbourhoods.
[Abdel's boss]
We're really worried, Abdel.
What's goin' on?
Tell me how I can help you. Yeah?
[Abdel] I want the heads
of the cops that killed Idir.
Bring them here to me within the hour
or I'll kill him.
- Hold on, calm down, Abdel. Calm...
- [hangs up]
[Rachid] Yo, put it on Snapchat, Abdel!
We gotta put the pressure on them!
[woman on TV] Our top story tonight.
We continue to bring you live coverage
from the Athena estate,
where the fallout following
the death of a local child
has led to an escalation of violence,
with the situation now
completely out of hand.
It's just 24 hours
after the release of the video
showing the fatal attack on young Idir.
- The whole of France is now ablaze.
- [phone rings]
At least 30 cities are experiencing
unprecedented violence.
Police stations have been targeted,
as well as the mosques
in Roubaix and Colmar,
where buildings have been set on fire.
We've also just heard that a far-right
group of about 100 people
has stormed Dijon City Hall.
Throughout the country, the situation
is completely out of the police's control.
Sources have said
that the army may intervene...
I'm sorry about your brothers.
Over to our special correspondent,
Clément Lafont, live from Lille.
[yelling and explosions on TV]
[Lafont] Yes, it's chaos
here on the streets outside City Hall.
Hundreds of young people
have descended on the area...
[hums softly]
Whoo!
[Lafont] Cars have been set alight,
stores have been looted,
and the local residents...
- [woman shouting on radio]
- [Fifou] Boys, come and help me.
I'm on the sixth floor with a dad
that won't leave his apartment.
- [woman] No...
- [Rachid] Yo, fuck, Abdel.
People don't wanna leave.
What do we do?
[Lafont] ...by far the worst
in living memory...
- Abdel?
- While the police are doing their best...
- Abdel!
- [gunfire in distance]
- [woman screams]
- [gunfire]
[gunfire]
- Watch him!
- [gunfire and screaming]
[woman] Leave that!
[gunfire]
[woman] Stop shooting!
- [gunfire]
- Hey! Stop it!
- Hey! Who told you to shoot?
- Sébastien told us.
- They can't attack then.
- Where'd he go?
[Fifou] They're downstairs,
settin' up the gas cylinders.
Hey! No one's staying behind!
- Go downstairs! Go on.

I'm not trying to take the piss...
- Come on, just get out.
- Fuck off!
- Hey, you have to go!
- We're not going anywhere!
- Just go quietly!
- What you doin' this for?
- Why should we go?
- What's the problem?
- Mum!
- Don't touch me.
- Take your kid, go!
- I said, don't fuckin' touch...
- Take your kids and go.
- I'm going!
Just go. Get out of here!
And stop fucking filming!
Sébastien!

Repeat on every floor. Come with me.

[Abdel's boss] Abdel,
we're bringing out the last families now.
You're on your own with the youths.
We're coming back.
Turn yourself in.
Have you found them?
Found who?
[sighs] Fuck, Abdel, they're not cops.
Bring them.
You're going to have to bring 'em.
We think they're far-right guys.
They're not our men.
It's over.
Bring them or I'll do it.
- Abdel, I don't think you understand...
- Bring 'em here.
- Listen. We led an investigation.
- Bring 'em here. Bring 'em here.
- We don't know...
- Bring 'em here. Bring 'em here!
- ...not proper uniforms...
- Bring 'em here!
- I don't know where they...
- Bring 'em here!
- Abdel, listen to me!
- Do you hear me?
- We don't know them! They're extremists!
- [roars] Bring 'em here!
- Calm down!
- Bring 'em here, I said!
- The counter-terrorism guys will step in...
- I'm gonna kill him.
[panting]
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I'm gonna do it.

[Abdel breathing shakily]
[lift doors open]
[phone ringing]
[Abdel's boss] Hello, Abdel.
What's goin' on?
[Abdel] Film.
[Jérôme] Stop, Abdel!
What are you doing?
- [boss] What are you doing?
- It's all right! Stop, Abdel, I'm begging!
- Will you bring 'em here?
- [Jérôme] I'm begging!
- Will you or not?
- [Jérôme] I'm begging!
- [boss] This isn't the time to lose it!
- [Jérôme] I'm begging you!

- Will you bring them?
- [Jérôme] Please, let me go!
- Will you or not?
- I'm begging you, don't do it!
- Don't do anything stupid, Abdel.
- Keep him alive. We'll come get him.
- Will you bring those men?
[roars] Will you or not?
[boss] No!
- Abdel, please don't.
- I won't, because they don't exist, okay?
- Please don't do it.
- Calm down.
- It's not worth it. Enough.
- Let go of him.
- Abdel, that's enough!
- Stop right now.
- [Jérôme] Please, Abdel.
- Enough, Abdel! Putain, enough!
- Leave him alone.

[Fifou] You lot! Sébastien's downstairs,
he's gone fucking mental.
He wants to blow up the building!
- We gotta go! Come on!

[Rachid] Yo, Abdel, let's go.
Come on. Abdel! We gotta go!
Fuck, come on, man! We can't stay here!
Fuck's sake, Abdel!

Shut your mouth! No talking!
Hands behind your head.
Keep your eyes forward.
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!
Hands behind your head!
Hands behind your head!
Don't move! Don't move!
Hands behind your head!
Let's go, let's go!
Get down on your knees!
On your knees, now!
Eyes forward.

Don't try anything! Don't fucking...
Don't move! Hands behind your head!
