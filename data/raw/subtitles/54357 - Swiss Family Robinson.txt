[ Man ]
Help! Help!
Somebody, help!
Help! Help!
- Help! Help! Get us out of here!
- Help!
- We're trapped!
-[ Woman ] Francis?
- Help!
- Help!
- Help! Help!
- Help!
Help! Help!
What happened?
She's hit something.
Have mercy!
I can't get it open.
It's jammed.
You first,
Fritz.
[ Grunting ]
Ernst, help
your mother.
Captain Wilhelm?
Anybody here?
[ Ernst ]
Anyone there, Fritz?
If anybody was here,
they'd have heard us long before this.
It's just as
I was telling you.
If they've abandoned the ship,
they've got no right to claim it.
It's ours...
by maritime law.
I can't believe they'd leave us here.
Something must've happened.
Something's happened,
all right.
They thought the ship was gonna sink in
the storm. It was every man for himself.
It was carrying too much sail.
I heard the Captain and mate arguing.
If I'd been captain, I'd have fought
the pirates, instead of running.
All right,
Mother.
Whew, what a mess.
At least we're not
too far from land.
Then there's hope.
Maybe when we get to shore we can
get some help, make her sail again.
She'll never
sail again.
Maybe we could build a raft.
We've got enough wood.
Fritz is right.
The sooner we get ashore, the better.
[ Francis ]
Hey! Look what I found.
- [ Mooing ]
-[ Francis ] Look!
[ Mother ]
Oh, those poor things.
They must have had a
worse time than we did.
How's it look?
Are we solid on the rocks?
I don't know.
No, I'd say we're, uh--
Well, we're here at least
until the turning of the tide.
[ Francis ]
Help me, somebody, help! Help!
[ Barking ]
No!
Look what I found!
The Captain's dogs!
And are they glad
to see me! Whoa!
- He's all right.
- Better make a start. Come on.
Come on,
give me a hand.
Suppose it's
a deserted island.
I can work out where we are
soon as I learn how to use this.
All right,
take it along.
It still works.
There's no time
for that now.
Oh.
Why don't we put up
a distress flag?
Don't you think
we look distressed enough?
Ernst, anyone who sees
a ship stuck on the rocks...
might possibly guess
it's in trouble.
You look after them, Turk.
You too, Duke.
But I don't see how we
can take all these animals.
- We're not taking them.
- But we can't leave them here, Father.
They'll die.
When your mother and
brothers are safe on land...
then you can talk to me about
the animals, not before.
Francis, get them
out of there.
- We don't want this one or that.
- Wait a minute!
- Or that.
- Wait a minute, they wanna go too.
We don't want
any of them.
All right, Fritz.
Put it over your head.
That's it.
- All right, I'm fine.
-Just hold tight. Grip the rope here.
Ernst.
- All right. Don't worry.
- Come on, Mother.
Right, Mother,
now don't worry.
Right, Fritz.
- Come on.
- Now.
- Sorry, Mother.
- You all right?
[ Whimpering ]
[ Francis ]
Hey, Fritz! The dogs!
- He forgot the dogs!
- They're not coming with us.
- Cast off, Fritz.
- They're my dogs! I found 'em.
Francis, sit down. They weigh more
than any of us. We'd sink.
- All right, Fritz?
- All right.
All right.
Watch that wreckage!
[ Barking ]
[ Barking ]
Here comes the dogs,
going to swim it.
[ Francis ]
Come on, Duke! Come on, Turk!
You can make it! Come on, boys!
Keep swimming!
[ Father ]
Straight between those rocks.
That side, Ernst,
that side!
Never mind that side!
Help me push over here!
[ Barking ]
[ Barking ]
Come on, boys! You can make it!
Keep swimming!
Look out, Ernst!
Watch those rocks!
Your side, Ernst!
[ Fritz ]
Push off!
Come on, Turk!
Come on, Duke!
Look out!
Look out!
Do something!
They'll drown!
We can't take
any more chances.
Look!
[ Barking ]
Come on, boys!
Come on!
[ Barking ]
Good boy, Turk!
Well done.
Keep them
in the middle.
- That's right, in the centre.
- You see, they didn't sink us.
Let's get to shore.
I wouldn't dare pray
for anymore miracles, not in one day.
Fritz, the wave
in the front there.
Hey, Turk, Duke!
Wait for me!
I'm coming too!
Hey! Wait for me!
[ Mother ]
Francis, come back! Stay in your tub.
-[ Francis ] I'm coming! Hey!
-[ Barking ]
I'm coming!
I'm coming, Duke!
Francis,
come back here!
[ Father ]
Tie it around the tree stump.
- Come on, let's go.
-[ Mother ] Francis!
[ Father ]
Francis, come back here!
Oh.
- [ Growling And Barking ]
- See ya later.
First thing we've got to do
is to unload the raft.
Then, uh--
Put up some sort
of shelter for the night.
Not the first thing.
Fritz.
Hold it, Fritz.
We are not making
any progress.
- I know it, Father.
-[ Father ] It's got to hang even.
Aren't very good.
We're lucky
to have them.
[ Ernst ]
Pull your side down.
[ Fritz ]
Right, I've got my side.
-[ Father ] Hold it down, Fritz.
- Right.
Come on.
You're very lucky
to have them, you know.
[ Growling ]
Fritz,
I think tomorrow...
if the ship's
still there...
you and I and maybe
Ernst ought to go out...
and try and
bring in the animals...
anything else
we might need.
How long do you think
we'll have to stay?
Well, I don't know, Mother.
I just, uh--
I just think we ought
to do everything we can.
[ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
What's going on?
Powder was wet.
[ Thunder ]
[ Birds Squawking ]
Aren't you coming
to bed?
[ Thunder ]
You have to have
some sleep.
Besides it's going
to rain.
No, I'm all right.
No one can
ever go back...
and undo what's
already done but--
well, I--
I want you
to know that--
well, I'm sorry
things didn't work out.
Not the way
I wanted them to.
I know.
It would have been so much better
if we'd just stayed in Bern.
I'm not so sure
of it...
not with Napoleon Bonaparte
trying to grab more and more.
Fritz and Ernst
might both be in war...
maybe even you.
No, it would have been better to stay
and face things rather than just...
running away.
Is it running away
to try to find a new life...
in a new colony?
To try to give our sons
a chance to live...
a chance to be free?
Is that
running away?
I keep thinking
about all the men...
who work in those other
offices along the Marktgasse.
They go on working at the same old jobs
and manage to find...
opportunities
for their families...
without running off to
the other side of the world.
I thought we settled all this
before we left home.
It was a good thing
we set out to do.
We were right.
All that hasn't changed
just because we were shipwrecked.
You're always right,
aren't you?
We'll get there,
I'm sure of it.
I'm sure of it!
Sooner or later,
there's bound to be a ship.
I'll pray for it
with every breath I take.
It's a big land,
New Guinea.
For hundreds of years
there've been new colonies...
a great new world
to build.
No limit to what
a man can do.
Just because we're a couple of months
late getting there won't matter.
We're not too badly off,
are we?
- We've got each other.
We've got the family.
-[ Thunder ]
- Food to eat.
- And a tent to keep the rain off...
if we had sense
enough to use it.
Oh, the dogs.
- Here, Duke!
- Try to keep covered up.
Now, don't worry.
Try to go back to sleep.
- [ Barking ]
- I'm soaked!
Having trouble?
Oh, I'll get it down...
but it may take a while.
[ Pigs Squealing ]
Easy.
[ Squealing ]
- Easy.
- Wait a minute.
Hold him.
Hold him.
Easy!
I keep trying to tell her
it's for her own good.
-[ Ernst ] A ship!
- What?
- There's a ship!
- Come on!
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
I think they've seen us.
Ahoy!
[ Ernst ]
Ahoy! Ahoy!
Ahoy! Ahoy!
[ Ernst ]
Ahoy!
Take a look,
Fritz.
[ Fritz ]
There's something on the sail.
I knew it. It's the pirate ship
that chased us into the storm.
Get down.
Ernst, get down!
And I deliberately tried
to get their attention.
At least this time we have something
to fight back with.
- Do you know how to fire it?
- I think so.
Let's pull it back.
[ Grunting ]
I'll get a keg
of powder.
See if you can find some rags
we can use for wadding.
I know.
I'll be right back.
[ Speaking In
Native Language ]
[ Native Language ]
We only have one shot.
Let's wait till we can't possibly miss.
- What's happening?
- They're leaving. They're going away.
[ Ernst ] Do you think they saw us
loading the cannon and got scared off?
Pirates scared off by
one cannon and three people?
Do you know what
they're up to, Father?
- What's that?
- That? Oh, that's a quarantine flag...
warning that
there's black death aboard.
- How did you know that?
- I do a bit of reading too, you know.
Come on, Fritz.
Hmm.
[ Mooing ]
- Pull those new lines tight, Ernst.
- Right.
There, that's it.
There.
[ Grunting ]
Oh no.
What's the matter with you?
Not that way, stupid,
this way.
- Maybe we tried too much for one trip.
- We had to try.
Sharks.
Sharks!
- You got one!
- Watch that one coming in!
- There's another one!
- I'll get it!
[ Ernst ]
I hit it!
[ Fritz ]
Here comes another one!
[ Ernst ]
Get out of here.
Got them.
Look out, Ernst!
There's another!
No, it isn't.
It's a turtle.
Probably disturbed
him with our shots.
I think we
scared them away.
[ Chuckling ]
He's pulling us.
Ha-ha-ha, it's better
to use your head...
than break your back,
I always say.
Francis, see if you
can find the--
Francis,
where are you?
-[ Mother ] Here, Duke, Turk!
- [ Barking ]
Francis?
Where's Francis?
Go find him.
Now, you wait
just one minute...
and I'll have some
sugarcane for you.
Come on, little fella,
I won't hurt you.
Here, little elephant.
Come here.
That's right.
Come on, little elephant.
I wouldn't hurt you.
Come on, little fella.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I have some nice fresh
sugarcane for you.
Come on, come on.
[ Trumpeting ]
Come on.
Come on.
Just a little closer.
That's right.
Come on, little fella.
[ Mother ]
Francis, where are you? Francis?
Now you just put
your foot right there.
Come on, little elephant,
a little closer.
Just a
little bit closer.
Right--
Now, stop pulling!
[ Trumpeting ]
[ Growling ]
What's the ma--
[ Mother ]
Francis! Francis!
You, get outta here!
Francis!
Francis, where are you?
[ Francis ] You get away from my
elephant! Get out, he's my elephant!
[ Barking ]
[ Barking ]
Duke! Turk!
Come on!
[ Francis ]
You beat him enough.
- Oh, good old Duke.
- Good boy.
Did I tell you
you could leave the beach?
Don't you know you might have been
eaten wandering off that way?
Well, what do you have
to say for yourself?
- I'm sorry, but--
-[ Trumpeting ]
[ Mother ]
But what?
Can I keep
the baby elephant anyhow?
Now, I'll keep ya.
Come on, Rocky,
get going.
All right, Francis,
hold it.
Slack off a bit.
Come on, Rocky, back up.
Good fella, back up.
Right.
Hold it.
- That was a good idea of yours, Ernst.
- Thanks, Fritz.
[ Chuckling ]
[ Father ]
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Come on.
Whew! Here.
Fritz, no more full planks,
just some odds and ends.
I think we got
enough here, Father.
Well, what do you
think of it?
I'd like it a lot better
if I knew tigers couldn't climb trees.
They won't climb this one
by the time we're finished with it.
You've probably never seen such a house
as this is going to be.
I'm sure of that.
The world is full of nice,
ordinary little people...
who live in nice,
ordinary little houses...
on the ground.
But didn't you ever dream of
having a house up in a treetop?
No, mostly I dream of having
a house in New Guinea.
You must think we're going to be here
for quite a long time.
This I have no way
of knowing.
But we can't sit on the beach
just waiting for a ship.
But there
could be a ship.
Of course.
Then I think we ought to try
to light the signal fire.
Just forget about
the pirates?
Maybe they won't come back.
Maybe we could get away with it.
We can't take
that chance.
Right now being alive is more
important than being found.
[ Mooing ]
Don't look down.
All right, Mother,
I've got you.
Well, what
do you think?
Fritz, can I sleep
with you tonight?
- What an idea.
- It isn't exactly
built for two, Francis.
- But I'll give you a swing.
- Oh, good!
Fritz, be careful.
Take this rope...
and tie it around
his waist!
- [ Chuckling ]
-[ Father ] Mother!
- Getting on, aren't we?
- [ Sighing ] Yes.
[ Francis ]
Oh no, Fritz, you let me out.
Here, I want to show
you something.
[ Francis ]
Oh, faster, faster.
[ Gasping ]
Look, this
is our room.
You're not going to get me
to go up there unless you
make some sort of railing.
But you don't understand.
It's going to be like a real house.
You know, enclosed.
This is your own circular stairway.
Let's go back down before
someone falls off the edge.
- Come on, Francis.
- He'll be all right, Mother.
-[ Father ] Let me go first.
-[ Screeching ]
[ Screeching ]
Come on, little fella,
I wouldn't hurt you.
I just want
to pet you.
Come on,
come on.
Francis!
[ Father ]
Francis! Hold him, Ernst!
[ Ernst ]
I've got him!
- He caught it!
- You all right, Francis?
- Yes, he's my new pet.
- Aww, look at him.
-Don't let him go.
-Hey, you should feel his heart beating.
Mine could match his
beat for beat.
Supposing I hadn't just
happened to insist...
that he have this rope
tied around his waist?
Until you get some sort
of railing put up...
I don't want Francis back up here
and I won't be up here either.
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't blame you for being upset.
You don't seem to
understand what we have in mind.
- No, but won't you trust us?
- Do what you like.
Just see that Francis
is on the ground and I won't be back.
All right, all right,
we'll do that.
You stay back in camp and when
we've got everything fixed up...
just the way we want it,
then we'll bring you back,
see how you feel about it.
Don't you think you
can talk to me like that.
-[ Mother ] How much further?
- Hurry, Mother.
You're gonna love
this new house.
This way, Mother,
wait'll you see what we've done.
I really think
you're gonna like it.
[ Ernst ]
You just wait.
- We must be there now.
- Wait till you see this.
- I can't wait.
- Take off the blindfold.
[ Mother ]
Oh!
- Oh.
-Just a moment, please.
Old Swiss custom--
- carry the bride across the threshold.
- Father.
[ Barking ]
Duke, Turk,
get outta my way.
How's this?
All the latest innovations--
running water...
genuine imported
tortoise shell.
And not forgetting
the cooler.
This is Ernst's contribution.
He invented it. He and Fritz built it.
See how it works. Look, big wheel turns
the little wheel up there.
The cup pours the water into the
shell. It runs down the bamboo...
feeds the sink
and the cooler.
I can't believe it.
Darling,
thank you.
I'm second.
I go after Mother.
Hey.
- Thank you.
- Up you go.
[ Squawking ]
[ Father ]
Up there's the boys'room.
And look.
This is something
I worked out.
When you're in for the night,
turn the wheel.
[ Father ]
Pull up your stairs.
Not only keeps
out wild animals...
but any neighbors who might
become a nuisance, you know,
always wanting to borrow something.
We'll be troubled
so much by them.
Hey, get me down.
Oh.
Remember this?
I built it for us.
Don't tell me you...
you pull this
to ring for the butler!
Here, I'll show you.
Now, you can lie here
and look at the stars.
Don't you remember?
That summer we went
to Interlaken?
You said that someday
if you could have your wish...
you would sleep each night
so you could see the stars.
What is it?
What's wrong?
These curtains don't
belong in here.
Well, they're from the captain's cabin.
We thought you'd like them.
It's so wonderful.
I don't deserve it.
I can't believe it.
Don't worry
about the curtains.
If you don't like them,
I know a woman who can fix anything.
Oh.
Here it is. ''Tiger.
Panthera Tigris. Native of Asia.
Ranges north to Siberia...
and south to India
and the Malay Peninsula.''
That can only mean one thing,
a land bridge.
That's how there came to be
so many different kinds of
animals on one island.
Well, how do you know
it's an island?
Why couldn't it be
a peninsula?
Well, why don't you let us
try and sail around it?
You know how your mother
feels about that.
It's just as
I was telling Fritz.
I think there used to be a land bridge
between here and Asia.
That would explain how so many
different types of animals
came to be trapped here.
What do you think, Fritz?
Do you agree?
I suppose there could have
been one a long time ago.
There's only one way
to find out.
Why don't you ask Mother again?
Maybe she'll change her mind.
[ Ernst ] After all, Mother wants
to get to New Guinea as much as we do.
There might be
something there...
a village or an outpost,
someplace where ships come in.
If the occasion presents itself,
I might bring it up.
What's this,
spelling competition?
Tiger, bear, elephant.
That's the list of animals
we've identified so far.
- Hyena, monkey, lizard.
-[ Trumpeting ]
[ Barking ]
Ostrich.
[ Francis ]
Help!
Whoa!
Help me, somebody!
-[ Father ] Francis!
- Help!
Francis, let go!
I can't let go
or he'll get away!
[ Fritz ]
Let him go anyway. We'll catch him.
Francis!
Head her over this way!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Are you all right, Francis?
- Not a mark that won't wash off.
- Grab his neck!
- We can learn to ride him.
Ride him? Let me try,
somebody help me up.
I think we'd better
get him trained first.
- Let me try it then.
- All right, all right.
I get to try next.
I got him. I got him.
Hold on!
Hold on! Hold on!
Oh, you sillies.
[ Shouting ]
Here I go!
Whee!
[ Francis ]
Watch out for that rock.
Yea!
[ Francis ] No fair stopping.
You gotta keep swinging.
[ Ernst ]
Ya-hoo!
Francis, come on. Come on, everybody.
Follow the leader.
Fritz.
Come on,
I'll race you down.
[ Yelling ]
Mother, look at me!
- Go ahead, Father. You can do it.
- Me? Of course I can.
Here I come!
Where're we going,
Ernst?
Wait and see.
Come on!
-[ Screeching ]
- Hey, look at the monkeys, look!
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Look at 'em swinging.
[ Father Chuckling ]
Look at that one.
- I can do that.
- Let's see you try.
[ Fritz ]
Anyone can change hands.
- Now steady, Fritz.
- Go on, Fritz.
-[ Father ] He's done it!
- Whew!
- My turn next.
- No, no, it's my turn.
After me, after me.
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Laughing ]
Are you all right?
Never better.
See what I mean?
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- You are very graceful.
- Thank you very much, Mother.
Don't you sometimes feel this is
the kind of life we were meant to live?
Everything we need, everything's
right here at our fingertips.
You know, if only people could...
have all this
and be satisfied...
I don't think there'd
be any real problems in the world.
Or any future
generations.
Hmm?
There isn't everything
we need right at our fingertips.
What are you
talking about?
This, it's wonderful
for today, I know.
But what about tomorrow?
What about our sons?
- What future is there here for them?
- Don't worry about tomorrow.
- It'll take care of itself.
- Suppose we should
never get away from here.
They'd never know what
it was like to be married.
Yes, it, uh--
Yes, that's right.
Now you come to mention it,
there aren't many girls.
It's not anything
to joke about.
Suppose they never have a chance to
know what it's like to have a family.
What you're
trying to say is...
we ought to make every possible effort
to get away from here.
- Exactly.
- Right.
Then I'll tell the boys we've decided
to let them sail around the coast.
-See what they can find.
- That's not what I said at all.
Sooner or later, we're
going to have to face it.
But what do they know
about sailing and outrigging and--
Do you think it's safe?
We can't hold
onto them forever.
Come on, Rocky,
you can pull it faster.
- Come on, pull!
- Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
-[ Barking ]
- Fritz, grab ahold. That's it.
We'll be back soon.
Maybe we'll find a ship to take us away.
- Oh.
- Don't worry, Mother.
Oh, be careful,
Fritz.
Drop it, Ernst.
[ Father ]
Francis, get Rocky clear.
Back up,
back up.
Well, it's gonna
be up to you, Fritz.
If you run into a storm
or trouble of any kind...
I'm relying on your judgement,
your good sense.
Make sure you both
get safely back.
[ Francis ]
Come on, come on, Rocky, let's go.
- Good-bye, Ernst.
- Good-bye, Mother.
You got nothing to worry about.
Remember to use
your head.
Yippee!
Ya-hoo!
[ Snorting ]
[ Father ]
Good luck.
Don't worry.
They'll be back before you know it.
- I hope we are doing the right thing.
- Hmm?
- Letting them go.
- I'm sure we are.
Perhaps we ought to have
let 'em go sooner.
We might have been
in New Guinea by this time.
[ Francis ]
Bye, Fritz. Bring me back a crocodile.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Oh, Fritz, I wish Mother
could see this place. She'd love it.
You know what I'd like?
I'd like to see some
real mountains once again.
Walk the Oberland. Stand looking up
atJungfrau when a storm moves in.
Remember how you could
smell the snow in the air?
Yeah. Fritz, do you ever
think about where you'd be...
what you'd be doing
if you'd have stayed in Bern?
-Sometimes.
-I think about Herr Kobel. What he said.
- That I should attend the academy.
- Fine chance you would have had.
Well, you can't tell.
It might have worked out.
I'll tell you where
I'd really like to be.
Walking down the Nydeckgasse--
like on a Sunday after church...
and all the girls stroll past
all dressed up.
Any one in
particular?
No, nobody special.
Maybe you don't even know them,
maybe you don't speak.
But you look and they look
and you just know they're there.
Fritz, listen, do you think
when we get to New Guinea--
if we ever do--
there'll be any girls our age?
By the time we get to New Guinea,
we won't care what age they are!
[ Laughing ]
Ernst,
get the sail down quick!
- Keep down!
- What's the matter, Fritz?
What happened?
Quick,
get me the glass!
[ Fritz ]
There's something moving on the beach.
Pirates!
It's the one we scared off
with the quarantine flag.
- Let's try to sneak in a little closer.
- Oh, yeah!
If we stay behind the rocks,
they won't see us.
- Ernst, bring the bow around.
- I'm trying!
[ Native Language ]
That chest they
just opened...
it belonged to my first officer,
God rest his soul.
I wish they'd fight
and kill each other off.
Shh! You let me
do any talking.
No, no, leave him!
Put him down!
Kuala, listen to me.
Kuala?
You, boy, hmm?
You born how long?
- He is 1 4 years.
- Huh?
- [ Native Language ]
- [ Native Language ]
Ow!
- Leave him alone.
- Ow!
- Leave the boy alone.
- [ Native Language ]
Kuala, wait!
You will want me
to write a ransom note.
I write.
My people send money
if you let me go.
You send plenty money.
Then you go.
Wait!
Leave the boy with me...
or I not write
ransom note.
No boy, no note.
[ Native Language ]
Ohh!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Bertie.
Sorry to have gotten you
into this.
We'll-- we'll get...
out of this somehow.
Keep as still as you can.
You'll only make things worse.
They'll have to decide which
crew is going to take us.
Ernst...
I think we could sneak in,
free the old man and the boy...
before the others knew
what was happening.
All right.
It's now or never.
Come on!
At least I think
they'll keep us together.
[ Native Language ]
Shh!
- Don't make any noise.
- Who are you?
Shh!
[ Native Language ]
- Who are you?
- We've come to help you.
If only we had a knife.
Quick, don't bother with me.
Get the boy free first.
Well, go on!
They won't harm me. I'm valuable
for ransom. Get Bertie free.
[ Native Language ]
Get away if you can.
- If they ransom me,
I'll get a ship and come back for you.
- I won't leave without you.
- Shh!
- Get away quickly.
Don't waste time on me.
Go on!
- Run!
- Run, Ernst!
[ Bertie ]
No, I won't go!
Go on, leave me!
Leave me!
[ Native Language ]
[ Gunshots ]
Ooooh!
Come on!
I can't go on
another step.
[ Native Language ]
In here.
- Ah--
- Shh.
Pirates took
your ship, huh?
What were you,
cabin boy?
You mean the old gentleman
is your grandfather?
Come on.
[ Bertie ] Who are you anyway?
Where did you come from?
- We were shipwrecked--
- Aaah!
[ Whispering ]
Ernst? Ernst!
[ Whisper]
Run, run!
Aaah!
- Come on.
- Come on!
They're leaving.
[ Fritz ]
They're going away!
[ Ernst ] It could be a trick
to get us to come back...
like the Greeks
and the Trojan horse.
I think we'll stay here
until daylight.
Probably save time cutting
across the island instead
of going around the beach.
There's no question now.
This is an island.
What about me?
What am I going to do?
I guess
you'll come with us.
Right about...
that direction should take us home.
But my grandfather?
If they release him,
he's bound to come here to look for me.
Don't worry.
He knows you're with us.
If we're not here, he'll
sail around the island.
He couldn't get a ship past our place
unseen even if he wanted to.
Come on, Bertie.
You can have the middle.
[ Ernst ]
Come on.
I'll just sit up.
Not sleepy.
- Fritz? Fritz!
- Hmm?
Do you imagine we've changed a lot
since we first landed here?
- In what way?
- Well, lots of ways!
- Like getting stronger,
more sure of ourselves.
- I suppose so.
