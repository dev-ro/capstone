- You aren't from here?
- No. From Poland.
Poland is here now.
At the crossing
to the right
and next over the lake...
...alongside...
Please be gentle to her.
She's lost a daughter recently.
OK?
Thank you.
I'm looking for
Rose Kwiatkowska.
I was present
at your husband's death.
He wanted me
to return this.
How did he die?
You can sleep here tonight.
Is it Tar to the town?
It depends which way...
Could...
Could you help me?
I have potatoes
in the field, which is mined.
But I'm no sapper.
I thought every
soldier knows how to.
Exactly. When the military come,
they'll clear it of mines.
- What military?
- Well...
Polish.
Nobody will live to see it.
Thank you for the food.
Is there a barber there?
There's nothing there
whatsoever.
Thank you.
What's going on here?
What's this gathering?
Nothing to wait for.
You need to write
an application... in Polish.
Next a conversation in Polish too.
Those with a certificate
01' belonging to the Polish nation
will be helped as ii
our own citizens.
Others. Germans, that is, will
get a date of displacement.
Is this clear?
What, you dimwits,
you don't get it?
We're good people, but not all
understand the Polish speech.
We've come to
ask you for grain to sow.
Nothing to eat,
the cattle's been stolen.
- They've forbidden us to mow grass.
- Who?
You know who:
The Russian commander...
Stop it!
What? You don't like
the Red Army, huh?
Where are your sons?
Your fathers?
In the Wehrmacht, the SS !!!
You raised your hand
against the homeland and what?!
And you want grain yet?!
What're you doing, man!???
You have no fear of God?
Hitler mugs, lousy Luthers!
Eat dirt!
Not a thing 01' your own here!
Please don't assemble.
Can you do it?
Sure enough.
You're my first customer.
I saw Polish ﬂags
on farmhouses.
Just squatters
From Kurpie, Masuria,
from God knows where.
Before the war, they'd come for
seasonal labor. And now...
They rob whatever
the Germans have left.
Don't settle in
an inhabited house
The Masuren who speak Polish
will be treated differently...
What would you like
to do here?
I don't know yet.
Maybe office work?
In line with politics
would be best.
Good. Thank you.
I'll look around.
What happened?
Nothing. They've come
to show oh' their Polishness
We thought they were Germans,
but they're Polish. A surprise.
- We're hungry.
- Everything's ready, Comrade Captain
You've seen what it looks like,
and would like to move in, yes?
To take over the farm?
Didn't you want it
yourself?
All right. I'll clear
it of mines and leave.
All I can pay you
with are these potatoes.
OK.
I'll need tools and wire.
Here.
Johann was right.
Only the Germans
treated us like people.
Leave it.
You go first.
Thank you.
I'll clear some more
field and we'll plant them.
Hello. I've brought potatoes
from Rose Kwiatkowska.
Nobody needs presents
from that slut.
- Behave yourself.
- Whore.
What're you doing?
Russian schmatte!
She didn't get it right
What did she do
before the war?
She was active in
the folk library.
She spoke Polish and was
considered pro-Polish.
We're bringing harvest...
January saw a great,
terrifying exodus of the Masuren.
And then returns in chaos,
without hope
that there was still
something to return to.
Only Rose returned.
Then in March,
the Soviet command
was stationed
on Rose's farm.
You crazy???!!!
We need no more field.
Enough. Oh, my God,
I was afraid that...
Come have
something to eat!
- I need a couple of things.
- So do I.
I have good stuff... green.
Look at what I've bought.
Who did it to you?
They said...
they'd hang me
if I don't leave.
How are you?
Fine.
I must go some place.
But I'll be back soon.
Look.
A round 01' cartridges here
This is how you reload
and shoot.
Repeat.
I need a doctor!
Please help me.
Please help me!
I need a doctor. My wife is dying.
I'm Polish. Help me, OK?
More water, clean cloth,
table spreads, whatever...
She's aborted...
Lost a lot oi blood. Must stay in bed
She needs to be washed,
but not by herself in this condition
Someone must help.
This antibiotic will contract the
uterus.
I'll show you how to give her a shot.
I'm no gynecologist,
but...
everything must be OK.
You live...
You've come out.
I had to.
You won't hide here
I'm not.
Sooner or later someone
will recognize you.
They won't round up
everybody.
It they don't jail you, they'll grind
you down like those Masuren.
How's Ann?
She's dead.
Good to see you, thank you.
Drop by my place, citizen,
for medicines.
We'll find a specialist and
will decide what to do next.
No.
This is a body pan
like any other.
I won't watch
Go to the attic
and call Jadwiga.
She is my daughter.
Go.
Mother's asking you
downstairs.
When the Russians came...
We ran away to the seaside
to get on board ships...
Whereas they...
would all the time...
I can't any more.
Speak Polish.
Your mother does.
My dad spoke German.
- Praise the Lord.
- Hello.
For ever and ever.
We're repatriates from Wilno.
From the first transport
We've settled behind the wood.
This means... we're neighbors.
That's good.
It'll be easier to live
We have a chicken and eggs.
Welcome inside.
But...
That's Mamulka, our bread winner.
We were afraid to leave her home.
Tie her to the tree
We'll see from the window.
Come.
- A beautiful farm.
- Thank you.
May we prosper
Your health
They'd say, don't get oh'
I see they were wrong.
Mines everywhere, but they say
you've cleared a field of them.
I have.
But why isn't that
boundary strip not cleared?
Just in case.
Your health
Everything's gonna be fine...
We'll help one another.
Julian.
Look, Vladek...
Like two turtledoves
Well... like us once.
Oh, you... stupid you...
Tadek, you don't have
enough for yourselves.
- Clear my field of mines.
- I will,
but you'll plant
nothing before the winter.
You aren't helping
me, Vladek.
When she died, we all
sewed a dress for her
with a thread without a knot
- Granny?
- Uh-huh.
A superstition, that?
We Masuren believe
that the soul remains by
the body till the funeral.
Hence a stool always
by the coffin.
So that the soul
could sit for a while?
Yeah.
When the body is moved out,
we open the windows...
so that it could ﬂy away...
And we leave an axe
on the doorstep.
What for?
I don't know.
To kill evil?
Just in case.
Hi.
A fine one?
Yes.
The Bible...
the word of God...
knows no division into
nations, races, or origins.
We live in fear
and mute protest
that the punishment we incur
is cruel beyond measure.
It's not for us to judge that.
Don't forget
that you're Masuren
rooted in this ground.
Without you
this earth will be nameless
Centuries ago,
your forefathers
came here
from the neighboring lands,
also, and in the first place,
from Poland.
You have a chance
to stay here,
although it's hard
I'm speaking German
to you for the last time.
From now on, services will
be conducted in Polish.
This is a condition for me
to be your pastor...
I think we must wait
till law and order
begin to function
This is our homeland,
our soil, our faith.
Gretchen and I want to stay.
We'll sign their forms.
We're bringing harvest,
for the lady of the house.
A rich crop has been yielded.
Now we ask for a glass of beer.
- Beer?
- Beer.
Someone's coming along.
I have an official letter
to Mrs. Rose Kwiatkowska
- Is this you?
- Yes.
Good bye.
You'll be German to them.
They'll displace you.
So they will.
So do it for Jadwiga.
It's her land too.
But I am!
Got that? Would you sign it?!
Take over this land
I trust you.
Leave it and go to sleep.
If' she doesn't sign, she'll
be deported to Germany.
The land will go
to displaced persons.
I see. But I'm living there.
I've cleared a whole field of mines.
So you are that sapper.
You fancied the woman, yes?
So marry her.
Every other man does it.
- Only lone women in Masuria.
- You may be right...
Could you advice something?
Where do you have
the dollars from?
For the building fund
or the orphans. You decide
Maybe something
could be done...
A sapper
and with a growing potential...
Thank you.
Good bye.
- What would you like?
- Beer.
Ha!
Remember me?
The fall oi 1943
near Pofaniec.
Our People's Guard
met you the Home Army.
Yes, I remember. You were
the security of the staff.
What're you doing here?
Where from?
I solidity the people's power...
in the Security Service.
I'm looking for young,
clever, and true patriots.
I'm through with soldiering.
- You clear fields of mines?
- A peaceful job.
You have a woman.
A German.
No, Masuren.
She speaks Polish.
Don't believe the nonsense.
Everyone's German here.
How did they vote
in the plebiscite, huh?
And the elections
of '32 and '33?
Hitler had the biggest
support from here.
Yes?! We hear that we're
returning to our land,
because there're Poles here.
And you claim they're German.
Maybe once when they spoke
a Polish dialect. And now?
That Polish identity?
Nonsense! But a necessary
argument to grant Poland these lands.
Maybe it's worthwhile
- to persuade them?
- But what for?
It'd give rise to a huge
German minority...
The point is for the nation
to be homogenous.
What did der Führer say in '32?
I don't believe there's ein Land in
Germany as loyal as the Masuren Land
Bringing your family here?
Only an uncle is left,
but in Siberia,
not of his own will.
How everything's
been fucked up! Fuck it all!
I'm sitting with a class enemy,
but drinking brotherhood in arms!
Were I one, I'd blew up trains,
rather than clear fields 01' mines
You know him?
A Russian bandit, he.
Vasil! Leave him alone!
Bandit or not,
he doesn't attack his own kind.
Take care.
I've sold eggs and milk
and bought a skin.
We can drink.
A half pint, darling.
That s.o.b. Stalin and
the other one from America!
Louder and you'll return
to the east, but farther on
You've left the patrimony
and come back to the motherland
- Was this Poland?
- Maybe not, but it is now...
Vladek...
Oh, Mother of God...
Who are you?
We're Polish,
displaced from Russia.
I live over here. Get it?
You live over there?
Then you're German
No, I'm Polish.
I live over there. Get it?
You live here, so you German.
My cow... My Mamulka!
Hey, leave him.
Don't shoot. Quiet...
Stalin, you understand?
Stalin, understand?
He ordered us to live here.
Understand?
Look. You Russian,
me Russian, he Russian.
The cow's Russian, too.
Drink.
- Those Russkies steal everything.
- Shut up.
Your health
Good?
- Good?
- Good.
Good.
You Russian, me Russian,
the cow's Russian.
He German.
What German?
Hey! Leave it.
Mother!
We must find his leg.
We'll ask Masuren for help.
Masuren?... You mean Germans!
Tadek, why run risks?!
Everyone says they'll deport Rose
Tadek, I can't.
I have kids. I can't! See?!
Half a year ago.
Half a year ago.
We'll check lymph nodes.
Raise your hand.
A little.
The other hand.
We'll listen
to your lungs. OK?
Does it hurt here?
Fragments of fetus
left inside.
Seems like carcinoma.
No, I can't.
Come. Get up.
The Vladeks are burning!
The Vladeks are burning.
You'll sleep here.
Julian.
What about Rose, Tadek?
No decision yet.
The Security Service
have taken your documents...
They sometimes do it.
Of course, I bear that in mind...
But...
we have a report now
Comrades from
the Province have arrived.
I'm sorry.
The other's not here yet.
Maybe in a week's time.
I need more morphine.
Do I know this bicycle,
or am I imagining...?
- How is she?
- Not good.
- Where did you get it?
- From the UNRRA. Hide it.
They're trying to uncover me.
The Security Service has my documents.
You must escape.
- I can't.
- Tadek, she'll die.
And they'll deport
the daughter to Germany
You must think
about yourself.
Someone shot from
a sniper's riﬂe.
I don't know anything.
The neighbors' house burned down
We haven't done
anything to her.
Get out of here!
Get out!
Hush, hush...
They never felt Polish
Eighty years ago,
they didn't feel German either
But we Germans
destroyed their identity,
their ethnic autonomy.
And now the Poles
will finish the job.
Father,
should something happen to me...
I'll take care of your family.
This is a revolution and as such
requires to act decisively.
Nothing depends on
your woman.
Frau Kwiatkowski and her daughter
have been negatively verified.
They'll be deported
to Germany. Look...
the place and date where
they have to report.
- Unless...
- What?
You don't want to fight, I understand.
But that's another matter.
I proposed you to the HQ.
- You did what?
- Just sign it.
This farm,
she, her daughter.
You're a scumbag!
Have it your way.
Bitch...
bitch.
Your smile and the look in your eyes...
more valuable than gold...
than honor.
She's mine! She's mine!
Julian.
We're leaving.
Amalka has an aunt
near Skierniewice.
No way to live here.
You wanted to rebuild
the house.
They have spoiled
my Amalka.
It's shame forever...
Nobody has spoiled her.
But for your fucking brawling
they wouldn't have raped her
My wile was raped and killed,
almost simultaneously.
Am Ito be happy she is dead?
Rose has been raped so many
times that she's dying now!
You hold a grudge against me?
This is really shameful!
The pastor will take care
of everything.
Do you agree?
Jadwiga...
And you?
Jadwiga...
Please...
"...so when love grows
to reach the desire
of unfinished endurance,
or when friendship
becomes so strong that
it begins to fear its end,
then you look back into the childhood
of the one you love.
The present seems insufficient
and short. So when you know..
So when you know
that the future is not to be,
you try to win...
So when you know
that the future is not to be,
you try to win the past, which...
and I to want to declare
my first joys..."
Give us this day
our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us
And lead us not unto temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For Thy is the Kingdom
the Power and the Glory
for ever and ever.
Amen.
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Spiritus sancti Deus
per omnia secula seculorum
Amen.
In the name of the Holy Trinity,
take this ring,
a sign of marital faith.
May it be an advance
of heavenly blessing
and help to attain
eternal salvation.
Remember what
Mother used to say:
The pastor will help you.
Don't wait for me.
Plan your life and be happy.
Stay
Illegal possession
of weapons, dollars...
You wanted to ask the Masuren for help?!
To set up a self-defense committee?
And Vasil?
We have a witness who
claims you've shot him.
Not true. But I hope
he's biting the dust.
Tadek!
He worked for the NKVD.
He intimidated the Masuren
with your permission.
Years later, they'll
thank us for it. Get it?
And Poland will be here!
With or without you!
Such a Poland?
Then without me, comrade.
What were you doing
in August, 1944?
Did you come out?
No. I fought my way through
to Warsaw, to the Rising.
Where did you get the dollars?
- Where did you get the dollars?
- I found them.
Father's name?
What were you doing...?
Fought my way to Warsaw.
The farm.
Where did you get the dollars?
I found them.
Father's name?
It paid to marry, huh?
What were you doing in August...?
Where did you...
and the Son
and the Holy Spirit...
Amen.
You don't fit in
with this world.
The year 1956.
What's this train?
The Germans are
returning to the "Reich".
They've left their farms
and hightail.
She is not here.
She's waiting for you.
Come!
Careful!
Julian.
