Miss... Are you all right?
Don't worry,
it must have been the heat.
You've cracked your lip,
it's bleeding a little.
Excuse me, miss...
you forgot this.
Wait, you're still bleeding.
Take this.
Maybe you should sit down a minute.
- Do you want me to take you to a hospital?
- No.
- My name is Alfredo, what's yours?
- My name...
I found it lying open on the floor.
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Wait, let me go with you.
Do you want a taxi?
Do you need some money?
Do you know your name?
Can you remember it?
It was the painting, wasn't it?
Works of art have power over us.
Great works of art
have great power.
Most of them will never understand,
but I do and I think you do too.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Just a second.
For the taxi.
Don't worry, just take it.
Miss! Miss!
Miss Manni!
Miss Manni!
Miss Manni, didn't you hear me?
Chief Inspector Manetti called.
He called a number of times.
- It seemed urgent. - Who?
- Manetti. Chief Inspector Manetti.
Who am I?
Manni...
"One to relax, two to sleep.
Anna Manni. Rome."
Hello? Information? I'm looking
for a number in Rome. Anna Manni.
Yes.
This is Anna. Leave me a message,
I'll call you up as soon as I can.
Set up those lights over there.
- Where are we?
- Rome, but you can't pass here.
- It's all right, I'm a police officer.
- She's okay.
Where have you been?
We found her an hour ago.
Manetti's checking it out.
He wants to talk to you.
Manni. Over here.
She's been dead for about twelve
hours. Looks like the same guy.
He raped fifteen women
and killed the last two.
I want you to go to Florence.
He's raped three women there,
but he hasn't killed yet. Why?
Three in Florence
and the rest in Rome.
You've followed all the cases,
you know the way he operates.
It's up to you. You leave tomorrow.
Talk to our people in Florence.
Tell them what you know and find
out what they know. Diplomatically.
You're bright. I can trust you.
Now that he's started killing,
he won't stop.
Anna! I'm out of here too.
How about going to your place
for a pizza and a video?
Marco!
Your gun...
Assistant Inspector Manni.
Did you come to Florence
just to look for me?
Well... you found me. Here I am.
I want you
the way you were this morning...
With your lips bleeding.
I wanted so badly to kiss
your mouth, your bleeding lips.
Stay awake!
I watched you
looking at the paintings.
You got that feeling, didn't you?
You got that feeling.
No, don't, stay awake! No!
I want you to come with me.
No!
Stop! Stop!
What's the matter with you?
Calm down, calm down!
I'm a police officer... from Rome.
Anna Manni.
Where are the paramedics? Hurry!
Hurry!
Yes, Monte Rosso Hotel, room 47.
The lab team's working on the room.
Sir, I found this out in the hall.
Okay, we're finished. We'll have
the results in a couple of days.
- Do you feel up to talking?
- Yes.
Was there anything unusual
about his features?
No.
- Could you identify him if you saw him again?
- Yes.
Do you remember
having seen him before?
Yes, at the police station.
He's identical to the composite
they made of the murderer.
We're doing all the clinical
tests... except for the HIV.
It's still too early for that.
You should have one in a month,
then in three and after six months.
- I know it's rough but... there's nothing to be done.
- No.
I'm sorry about all this,
but the law requires it.
This is a light sedative,
to help you relax.
If you don't want it, just say so.
You need to rest
and get your strength back.
Don't worry
about your loss of memory.
This kind of amnesia
is almost always temporary.
Lie down for a few minutes
and try to sleep.
Anna, I'll be right outside if you
need me. Get some rest. Okay?
Pay attention!
Are you all right?
- Oh, you've broken your glass.
- Yes.
- Would you like something for that cut? An antiseptic?
- No.
Oh, sorry.
She was right, you should
put something on that cut.
- It's bleeding a lot. Does it hurt?
- No.
- Sure?
- Sure. It just stings a little.
Anna!
- Let me take your bag. - No.
- Come on, I'll carry it. - Okay.
- So, how're you doing?
- So.
Inspector Manetti's on his way.
The commission's arrived,
they're waiting for you.
They're familiar with your case.
They just want to talk to you.
Why did you cut your hair?
It's so short.
I don't know.
I feel better like this.
- Why, is it a problem?
- Absolutely not.
Here, your new badge.
A new gun to replace
the one that bastard stole.
There was no negligence
on your part.
The commission just confirmed
what I knew already.
You know how fond I am of you,
how much I value your work.
I feel terrible about what
happened. Maybe it was my fault.
- Nine millimetre.
- Yes.
The rounds are steel-capped. The
best defensive weapon you can have.
They want you to stick
around headquarters for a while.
There's a lot of work
for someone like you.
And they want you to start seeing
our psychologist twice a week.
We'll get him, Anna.
Wherever he is, we'll find him.
Do you remember what you said?
When they start to kill
they never stop.
But he didn't kill me.
I think he wants me alive.
We don't have to look for him,
he'll come to me.
Starting from today you'll have
an around-the-clock police escort.
Two of our best men.
This is Anna. Leave me a message,
I'll call you up as soon as I can.
I was sent to Florence because...
I do most of my work
with the anti-rape team.
It all started with this series
of cases in Rome and nearby towns.
Then, in a month
there were three cases in Florence.
I was sent up there to exchange
information with the local police,
to find out what they knew.
I was in my hotel room one morning,
when I got a phone call.
It was a woman. She said she knew
I was working on the case.
She thought she knew
who the man was.
She told me her name,
but I can't remember it.
She said he was in town
and would visit the Uffizi Gallery.
How did she know that?
I don't know. She just said
that he'd be there that morning.
- Did you call headquarters in Florence?
- No.
I went to the museum.
I had a vague idea
of what he looked like because...
I saw the composites
at the police station.
It was a longshot...
but I went anyway.
Pretty stupid, huh?
Yes.
You know what I thought?
I thought... that if I saw him,
I'd arrest him or shoot him.
- What happened at the museum?
- There was a long line.
Lots of confusion.
Inside... a strange atmosphere.
It was really weird.
The paintings...
They... they seemed to be floating.
I followed a group of tourists
into a room and...
I entered the painting.
It was as if
I was suddenly immersed in it.
I mean,
I was looking at it, when...
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Let's try never to use words like crazy.
"The symptoms include a cold sweat,
nausea, anxiety, hallucinations,
severe depression
and personality changes."
Yes.
In 1817, the French writer Stendhal
was in Florence.
He was admiring the works of art
in the church of Santa Croce...
when he was overcome
by a powerful emotion.
It had happened to others
before him,
but he was the first to write
about the phenomenon in his diary.
What happened to you in the Uffizi
is known as Stendhal Syndrome.
"My feeling is so profound
that it borders on pity..."
"All this speaks clearly to my
soul. If only I could forget it."
There was a certain happiness in
the powerful feeling of Stendhal's.
Yet, in spite of that...
the only thing he wanted to do
was forget it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I come in?
Everything ok? Stupid question.
I brought you something.
Videos... Buster Keaton films...
for a laugh.
Frozen pizzas.
And a bunch of flowers... for you.
Marco... I don't want these things.
Don't worry,
I'll leave it for you anyway.
- Are you eating these?
- Yes.
- You never used to eat chocolates.
- Now I find I like to.
I miss you, Anna.
I can't make love, Marco.
I can't even think about it.
You see...
I feel different now.
- No!
- I'm sorry.
It's been so long since we...
since we made love.
Right... So you wanna have sex.
So you wanna fuck.
- Come on, Anna.
- You want to screw, huh?
Don't, Anna...
- Hey, stop. - Turn around.
- What are you doing?
You want to fuck me?
- Come on, Anna.
- I'm fucking you.
- Anna, stop it, please.
- You like it? Like to be fucked?
- Anna, come on!
- I don't want to hear your voice! Shut up!
I haven't finished yet!
I wanted to fuck him like a man...
the way that men do it.
The idea of being fucked
disgusts me.
- I'm scared.
- Of what?
Something... that's inside of me...
that makes me hurt myself.
I keep cutting myself...
hurting myself, mainly the hands.
But I don't do it on purpose.
Maybe I do.
The physical pain
doesn't bother me...
It makes me feel alive.
Now, let's put things in order.
Two very serious things
happened to you.
A rapist killer stalked you,
jumped you and all the rest...
And there's a good chance that
he'll come looking for you again.
Second, you got a shock
looking at those paintings,
a shock followed by hallucinations,
the Stendhal Syndrome.
That's important too.
But it's an illness
that will soon be over,
the memory of what you felt will
fade away until it disappears.
For the moment you have to...
try to love yourself more...
to stop despising yourself
because you were raped.
Don't hate yourself
because he desires you.
You're not responsible
for all that.
- Where does your family live?
- Viterbo.
Get away for a while.
Leave Rome, I'll tell your boss.
Go to Viterbo... it's close enough
for us to continue our meetings.
I don't like going back there.
I joined the police force
to get away...
from everything
that place meant to me.
My brothers... school friends...
my house, my father.
- Anna, you're back! Giulio!
- Always hanging out in the square.
Hi, Giulio!
- Look who's back.
- What did they do? Kick you off the force?
No, I'm on leave.
Why don't you pass
by old Mario's gym?
Watch out, I've been training!
Ciao.
- Anna.
- Hi, dad.
You're just in time for dinner.
Your brothers are here already.
New haircut...
You've changed the way you dress
too you look different.
Yeah! You look like a boy!
Why did you say
she looked like a man?
- Because she does, Dad... you saw...
- So?
She's hardly back in the house
and you have to upset her!
- Did the police send you to a doctor?
- Psychologist.
- Is that necessary?
- Yes. I think so.
I have problems, you know!
Is it closed? The museum?
It's been under restoration
for the past two years.
Anna! Anna!
My father never set foot in the
museum. I went with my mother.
She tried to teach me
art history... She was a painter.
Why do you think this incident
came to mind only today?
I don't know.
I was driving past the museum which
is closed for restoration work...
and I remembered it.
I might try painting something
myself. Is that alright?
Absolutely,
I think it's an excellent idea.
- Anna, what are you...?
- Calm down, before someone gets hurt.
Yeah, we're training!
All right, you two...
Okay, if you wanna get serious...
So I left him, I just had to.
Not that he was bad in bed,
I mean in bed he made up for it...
But some things are just too much.
He kept pushing and pushing
and finally something snapped.
No, I don't expect guys
to be completely honest with me.
Do I look like someone
who believes in fairy tales?
But still, a girl appreciates
a gentlemen now and then.
Sure, I'd like to kiss you too.
He never liked kissing!
I'm the opposite...
I'm the oral type.
Wait...
there's a place back here...
where you know,
the local whores go.
Come! Come with me!
Come!
A hooker from Senegal called us.
One of the bunch
who does tricks in this area.
She brings her clients
back here at night.
She found her lying down there.
- Hold a second.
- It's him again, same technique.
- What did you see?
- I come here alone, see.
Ask my friend...
I don't know who she is.
- And you?
- I've never seen her.
- Really?
- Never.
It was definitely
what's his name... Alfredo.
We're not sure it's his real name.
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Yeah?
We've got to protect you
night and day.
You see the guy down there?
His name is Parisi.
He was in the Marines.
He's pretty tough.
Here's the list you wanted.
I don't get it. Why do you want
to call all the women he raped?
- I mean...
- I just want to talk to them.
Who knows?
Maybe I'll learn something.
You didn't need to drive all this
way to give me these phone numbers.
- You could have faxed them.
- No, no, no. I wanted to see you.
- Anna! Tell Marco to come in.
- No, he has to go.
- What did you say you wanted?
- To see you.
So... what did you see?
- Who is it? Hello... Vincenzo.
- Hello, what's your name?
- Vincenzo Gorlai, right?
- Yes.
- Is your mummy home?
- Mummy!
- Hello.
- Yes, my name is Anna Manni.
- Do I know you?
- No... I'm a police officer.
I work with the ARD...
the Anti-Rape Department.
I see, what can I do for you?
I'd like to ask you
about your experience.
I'm really sorry,
but I can't answer any questions.
- I know how hard it is...
- It isn't a question of hard or easy.
I don't want to answer
any more questions, that's all!
I'm here with my children.
I was lucky I wasn't murdered.
- I know how you feel.
- I don't want to go back there.
- Do you want to know what happened to me?
- If you want to tell me.
Sure I do.
I remember trusting him.
I was lying in a field.
I remember his hands around my neck
squeezing tighter and tighter...
and the feeling of being torn
between the legs... inside.
Every time he stopped squeezing
my neck he hit me in the face.
I remember his stinking breath.
And I also remember thinking...
this son of a bitch isn't different
from my ex husband, that pig!
You know...
this city's full of monsters.
People attracted by safer living
conditions in the provinces
are having to pay an unexpected
price: Rents are rising...
You want to know
about my wife's murderer?
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I shouldn't have called you.
She was my wife!
The woman I loved!
I'll never know what happened
to her, how she felt!
Can you tell me what she was
thinking in those moments?
Can you, Miss Manni?
Left, left, combination...
keep 'em moving.
Left, left.
I'm sorry, Anna.
I didn't mean to, sorry.
- Why? The blood makes you sick?
- Hey, Anna...
Look! Look!
"I'm eating with Alessandro.
Join us. Dad."
- Hello.
- Hello, Anna.
I've missed you.
I've thought a lot about you.
You know, I read that book.
"My feeling is so profound...
that it borders on pity."
"All this speaks clearly
to my soul."
"If only I could forget it."
Stendhal couldn't...
And you? Can you forget?
Can you forget me?
I've missed you so much.
Never three with the same match.
It's unlucky.
Hear that noise?
It's running water.
It's absolutely... pure.
Do you remember
when you were pure?
You know,
Junkies used to use this place
but something
must have scared them away.
They left
to shoot up somewhere else.
Scream. Scram!
Let's play a game.
We're out in the country,
two miles East of the highway.
There's no trace of Anna.
The helicopter
has to go back to base
and continue the search
tomorrow morning.
Of course! I'm gonna carry on.
How many other teams can you get
to patrol the rest of this area?
Ring, ring, ring...
I really like to make phone calls
too, oh yes... I really do.
Like when I called you in Florence,
except then I had this voice.
You don't know me but there's
something I must tell you.
The man you're looking for will
visit the Uffizi this morning.
Yes, I like making phone calls.
And you fell for it.
I'd already spotted you in Rome.
I knew what you wanted.
You wanted me.
You like me, don't you?
I know you're always on my side...
And I love you too.
I see you changed your guns.
You moved up to a nine millimetre.
You don't use this baby
to stop your enemy.
You use it
when you want to blow him to bits.
I have to meet somebody in town.
I have something she desperately...
desires.
What fresh, invigorating air!
Help!
Help! Help me! Help!
Help me!
Help!
You'll have to do
a lot better than that.
Much better!
What are you going to do? Shoot
me? Are you going to shoot me?
You can't shoot me! You're a cop,
you have to arrest me!
I give up.
- Arrest me, it's my right.
- You have the right to shut up!
Well... is that better?
Move!
Can't you move?
What about a walk
in the nice fresh air?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear the water?
It's so clean.
You remember when you were clean?
What are you looking at?
You wanna have sex?
No, really, tell me...
What do you want?
Don't be shy. What? Oh, I see.
You want to take a... bath.
'Cause you feel dirty.
You want to take a long bath.
- Will I have this scar forever?
- No.
With a little plastic surgery in no
time you'll be as good as new.
The river runs down the valley
for a mile and a half
and then ends up in the water
company's outfall drain.
Why is locating the body
a problem?
The drain is divided
into dozens of filtering channels.
There was a scramble for contracts
around here when it was built.
A lot of people
tried to get in on the act.
Nobody knows
where the river ends up!
I'm an engineer
in the Maintenance Department.
I didn't have anything to do
with the speculation that went on.
I want that body found.
A broken neck,
a bullet in his chest
and enough blood
to fill a bathtub.
I want that body.
He's gone forever, Anna.
Dead... you killed him.
He'll never go away.
He'll always come back...
Always.
- Hello?...Thank you.
- I have Chief Inspector Manetti for you.
Anna, we're going to pay a visit
to that bastard's wife.
You were right, his name
was Alfredo, Alfredo Grossi.
- I thought you'd want to come along.
- Yes, I do.
Ok, we'll pick you up
in thirty minutes.
We know this is hard for you.
We'd like to ask you
about your husband's movements.
Dates, the days he wasn't home.
- That's her, isn't it!
- Excuse me?
I saw her picture
in the papers and on TV.
Mrs. Grossi, this is Inspector
Manni, one of our best officers.
As I already told you,
I'm Chief Inspector Manetti.
I'm not answering any questions
in front of her.
- Would you like to reconsider it?
- Sorry, it's out of the question.
Now... from the beginning...
Bear with me,
I'd like to know exactly
where and when
you last saw your husband.
- Hi.
- Hi, Anna.
MORBID AND EXCITING.
HOW WOULD ANNA FEEL ABOUT IT?
I feel myself changing.
My friend Betty says I'm crazy.
Why do you continue
to use the word "crazy"?
You know what I thought yesterday?
I thought my real name was Louise.
Louise...
Do you like Louise?
You're amazing,
you never say anything.
I read a really interesting story
on the way here.
There's this... judge...
sitting on a river bank.
A traveller asks him:
"May I use this boat?"
And he says: "Sure, it's mine".
The traveller
pushes the boat into the water
but it sinks and he drowns.
A man who was watching
shouts at the judge:
"Why didn't you warn him
that the boat had a hole in it?".
And the great judge replies:
"The question of the boat's
condition was not raised".
I know you're suffering but
the things that happened take time.
I don't have time.
He might appear at any moment.
- He's dead.
- Yeah? Who says so, you?
Did they find the body? No.
I can sense that he's still
thinking about me...
that he wants me...
that he stills exists.
I've recovered from one thing:
The Stendhal Syndrome.
Paintings don't obsess me anymore.
Don't look at it!
He left his mark on me.
They say that after 2 years and 4
operations the scar will disappear.
Do you think it will?
I'm sorry.
- Are you interested a lot in art?
- Yes. You too?
Very much, yes.
I study Fine Arts here in Rome.
Really?
- Wait, I get it for you.
- No. - No?
- Ok, thanks.
- Give it to me.
- My name is Marie.
- Marie? - Yes, Marie. I'm French.
But... I thought that Marie
was a woman's name.
Well, in French it isn't so exact.
It can be a man or a woman.
Do you have a... voiture?
- You mean a car?
- Yes. - No, I don't.
Then, if you like, I can give you
a ride on my French scooter.
- Okay.
- Okay? - My name is Anna.
C'est avec un grand plaisir
que je fais votre connaissance.
It's a... plaisir
to meet you too, Marie.
- No, Marie. - Marie.
- Voila. Marie. - Marie.
I love art too. What made you come
to Italy to study art?
Renaissance... rinascimento...
le baroque...
Raffaello, Michelangelo,
Masaccio, Simone Martini,
Tiziano, Giorgione, Botticelli,
Rosso Fiorentino, Caravaggio,
Leonardo da Vinci,
Mantegna, Tintoretto, Cosme Tura,
Paolo Uccello, il Pontormo,
Beato Angelico, Viligelmo,
Giacomo Della Porta,
Piero della Francesca!
He thinks I'm a Law student.
- Why didn't you tell him that you are a policewoman?
- I don't know.
What do you like about him?
Well... first of all
that he isn't a cop.
Have you thought
about how you met him?
Yes...
I was looking at some paintings.
- Like Alfredo.
- But it's not the same thing. You know it isn't.
I thought I had turned
into an arid, mediocre person.
And then I met a very sweet
French boy who made me smile.
I thought you'd be pleased
to know... that I laughed too.
Here, try this.
My mother sent it from France.
- What is it?
- Why do you ask? Don't you trust me?
It's foie gras.
- What?
- Goose liver.
It's really good.
It's really... tasty.
I've always hated liver.
Tout va bien.
Wait! Don't move! Let me do it.
No, let me do it.
- Anything new? - No, nothing.
- Anna? - She's home.
- You guys can go. I'll be here until three or four, okay?
- Okay.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello, who's there?
Marco!
There was someone in the street.
He looked like Alfredo!
I've been here for hours.
I haven't seen anyone.
Nobody looked like him.
Come on, I'll come home with you,
so you can relax.
But...
It's okay. Let's go.
Come on!
It's kind of funny sitting here...
having all this freaky art
looking down at you.
Please, it's not true...
Marco!
No! No, don't say that!
Marco!
No, leave him alone. Please.
No, he's got nothing to do
with all this.
No, you mustn't touch him!
Marco!
Hello?
Hello!
Fuck!
- It was him.
- We'll tap your phone.
- What did he say?
- He said...
Anna, what did he tell you?
- He said he knows I've been with Marie.
- Who's she?
No, I mean... Marie.
He's a boy,
a friend of mine from France.
He said he knows we're in love...
that we made love...
and he's very jealous.
He said
he's gonna teach him a lesson.
It doesn't sound like him.
This is not his way of operating.
He's not interested in men!
He said: "I'm very jealous of him".
"I'm going to teach him a lesson
once and for all".
Hello? Yes, Marie Beyle, please.
Tell him that Anna called and
to call her back as soon as he can.
Okay, thank you.
- Hello?
- Hello, it's Marie here.
- Are you all right? Tell me you're okay.
- Of course I'm okay.
Marco, you can hang up now.
- I've missed you so much.
- Me too, Anna. I missed you too.
All I do is think of you. I know
it's stupid, but I can't stop.
- I'm always thinking about you. I love you so much.
- Me too.
If anything happened to you,
I think I'd die.
But, what are you saying?
- Hello?
- I'm here, Anna.
- When will you finish your project?
- In half an hour.
- Okay, wait for me. I meet you there.
- Okay.
I wanna make love to you.
- Marco, I'm gonna take a bath.
- Okay.
It's closed.
Sorry, it's closed for today.
- I'm looking for Marie Beyle.
- Marie? Never heard of her.
Him, he's a man. He works here
as a research assistant.
Is that so? And who might you be?
Get your walkie-talkie out
and find him!
Okay.
- Hi.
- Oh, Anna. Excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- We're finished. I just need a few more minutes.
- Okay.
- How many minutes?
- Just a few.
I have to put away the models,
the canvases...
Can you wait downstairs?
You can't stay here.
- Okay, I'll wait for you downstairs.
- Okay.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
It's just that...
It's just that there are
some things I didn't tell you.
- Okay, later then.
- Okay.
- A bientot.
- A tout a I'heure.
- Ton francais est parfait.
- Yes...
Promise me that you'll come down
as soon as you're finished.
Yes, I'll come straight to you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Who is it?
Professor! Professor!
Is anybody in there?
Tell me what to do.
Should I lock the doors?
There's a body in there!
- Let me go!
- Wait, you can't go in there!
No! Let me go!
- Let her go!
- No! Marie!
Marie! Marie! My baby...
Anna... Anna...
- Anna! Listen...
- Don't touch him.
Anna! Anna, it's me.
Who called him?
Anna!
My son told me about you.
He called you
"ma petite merveilleuse Anna".
Come on, Marco... Come on!
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Everything scares me.
There's something I want to talk
to you about. Do you have time?
Yes.
He'll never give up, will he?
He's the kind of murderer who only
stops when he's caught or killed.
That's what a lot of people
are hoping will happen.
It's important that you understand
that he's not infallible.
He can be caught.
After all, he's just a man.
You know that he's just a man.
He'll never let himself be caught.
How can you be so sure?
Because... because he knows!
Because he knows what?
Everything...
Every fucking thing!
But how could he, Anna?
How could he know everything?
Bring it over here!
Come on, hurry up, guys, let's go!
Judging by its state
from over here...
I'd say he's been in the water for
at least three weeks... maybe more.
- Roberto! How was he supposed to be dressed?
- Yes, sir.
- Blue trousers, white T-shirt and black socks.
- Okay.
Mario, Mario!
I want to see you up there!
Officer! Officer! Officer!
What did I tell you?
It's a maze of canals.
The body was probably knocked
through one conduit after another.
Speculation.
You say you should have realized
he wouldn't let you have him.
- Have who?
- Marie.
Alfredo doesn't want me
to have anybody else.
- Which means you are his and no one else's.
- Why do you say that?
- You said he knows everything. Are you sure?
- Yes.
- At least he knows everything about me.
- Just a moment.
Think of what you just said.
"He knows everything about me."
You really believe that?
Believe it? I know it.
And you believe that he knows you
better than you know yourself.
Is that what you think?
I think you should live!
Now, please, go!
Why do you want me to leave, Anna?
Hi, this is Anna.
Leave me a message and I'll call
you back as soon as I can.
Anna, it's Marco.
We've found Alfredo.
We just hauled his body
out of the canal.
It's been in the water for 3 weeks.
There's another lunatic
running around, an imitator.
Call me as soon as you hear this.
That's no surprise, is it?
We knew that Alfredo was dead, that
it wasn't him who killed Marie.
What are you getting at?
It's the moment of truth, Anna.
The time has come
to shake off the lies...
like you take a winter coat off
when Summer comes.
Right, Manetti...
a minimum of three weeks.
There's no doubt, chief. It's him.
Her police escort?
Why isn't there one at night?
I called her,
but there's no answer.
Yes, I'm on my way there, now.
I'll stay tonight.
- Christ, where were you?
- Here!
- I called you over and over!
- Maybe I was in the bathroom.
- Did you get my message?
- No.
This afternoon they found Alfredo
Grossi's body in the canal.
- So?
- So?!
- Why don't you let me in?
- Why should I?
Don't you realize he's dead?
It wasn't...
Alfredo.
- No! No!
- Calm down!
No! No! No!
My God!
He forced his way in here...
he was saying crazy things...
he made no sense...
And then... and then he tried...
he wanted to rape me!
He tried to do the same thing
Alfredo did!
It was him, Marco...
He killed Marie!
He was the only one who knew
everything... because I told him!
- Why didn't you call us?
- Don't you understand?
He killed Marie out of jealousy.
He didn't want me to love
anybody else.
Why didn't you call me?
Anna, I don't believe it,
I mean, I just don't...
- What don't you believe?
- I don't believe it.
That the doctor wanted to rape
you and that he killed Marie!
What do you believe then?
Anna, I don't think
you understand right now, okay?
The body you found isn't Alfredo...
it isn't him.
- It was definitely him, Anna.
- No, it isn't Alfredo!
- What are you talking about?
- Because I know where he is.
- Where is he?
- He's inside of me.
I've become him. He's like a cancer
that grows bigger every day.
Every day his presence inside me
gets stronger.
Why didn't you realize?
Why didn't you help me?
Why didn't you stop me before I
killed him, before I killed Marie?
He forced his way into me...
Now I can't get rid of him.
Anna...
Anna, listen...
You have to help me get rid of him.
He won't stop. He controls me.
He orders me to do horrible things
like killing Marie and my doctor.
Okay, relax, calm down.
- Listen... I have to take you somewhere.
- No!
No, don't worry, I'll be with you.
Where's your gun?
- My gun?
- Yes. Where is it?
Why? Do you need it?
Yes, please.
Okay, then come with me.
- What?
- He loved paintings.
Maybe that's why
he likes to be inside of me.
Because I love art too.
It's in here.
Wait! I'll get it.
Do you recognize me now?
It's me, Alfredo!
I told you I wasn't dead
but you didn't believe me!
I have to remember
to fix everything before I leave.
Everything must be in order.
That's very important!
I have to go to Dad's on Wednesday.
Yes, I must not forget that.
I have to pick up my clothes at the
dry cleaners. It's very important.
That's the first thing...
and the second...
the second the clothes at the dry
cleaners... yes, that's important.
Where do I go from here?
Get her! But don't shoot!
Don't you dare shoot, it's Anna!
Don't you dare!
Okay I think I did everything.
I must call Betty.
I'll do my cleanings tomorrow.
Clothes, Dad and Betty...
There's so much to be done!
I'm so tired. I need to be alone.
- Stop! Wait!
- I'm so tired... - Wait!
What are you doing with that gun?
You want to shoot me?
- You want to kill me? No!
- Calm down!
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Don't be afraid.
We won't hurt you.
It's not your fault, Anna.
Just trust me. Trust me, please.
Relax, Anna. It's all over.
- It's all over.
- There's a good girl.
It's all over.
Relax.
- Relax now.
- Just take it easy.
Don't worry.
