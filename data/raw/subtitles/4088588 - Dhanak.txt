"Desert sands that feel cold..."
"Mustard fields that look like gold..."
"A gentle breeze that
blows from afar..."
"Shah Rukh Khan
will remain number one."
Salman Khan will be
the number one.
Share this bread,
there is no more.
She is lying.
That container is full of bread.
He can see everything.
He gets the sympathy of being blind
and I am blamed for being mean.
Bravo Chhtou!
"Bread in the stomach,
heads held high..."
"Off we go to change the
world and reach for the sky!"
Yeah right.
Heads.
Tails.
Salman again!
I don't want to play.
The coin has spoken.
So Salman is again an inspector
who helps anyone in need.
Long Live Salman!
You never get tired that
Salman is always an inspector?
Focus on the story. He is the
best inspector in the whole departement.
And every evil man in the
town is scared of him.
Because he has the biggest
muscles in the world and...
Of course. He has the best
parents in the whole world--
Boring!
You have to wait for 'and'.
Say 'and' quickly.
He lives with his parents
in a beautiful house and...
One day he is driving to
work and he hears a scream and...
He stops his jeep which
comes to a screeching halt and...
Jeep comes to a halt,
dust everywhere...
He leaps out to see a
woman being attacked by goons.
So he jumps out of his
jeep and lands like this...
...and then he rips off his
shirt. And then...
He punches, he kicks.
He kicks and punches
all the goons.
He grabs another one and
kicks him in the face.
He punches the last one.
He punches that one too!
I swear you've rigged that coin. I've lost the
last five times, not one Shah Rukh story.
No romance, just violence
early in the morning.
I barely managed to get to school.
Kelas Ram.
Mira.
Pari.
Pari, you're a smart kid.
Why did you do this?
- See you tomorrow.
- Ok.
- Chhotu, I failed!
- Good job! Long Live Salman!
Long live 'me'!
We'll finally be in the same class.
Hindi, zero. Math?
- Big zero.
- Geography
Even bigger zero.
Science?
Huge zero.
Now you see how my
grades will just skyrocket.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You suck at Math.
That's all in the past now. With your
help I'll master every multiplication table.
Six into one is six.
Six into two is 14.
Six into three is 20.
Careful.
Fat Bhanu.
Don't be afraid, get behind me.
- Lets go the other way.
- No!
You're not Salman, idiot.
You'll get the crap beaten out of you.
Chhotu! Stop!
Chhotu!!
Where are you going blind!
Get up!
Is that all you could think of?
Tripping a blind guy?
Fat boy, I know eating
cow dung has made you stupid..
...at least subject
me to intelligent cruelty.
I am truly disappointed at
your complete lack of self respect.
Your father would be disappointed
that you learnt nothing from him.
Bravo Chhotu. Now we're dead.
Oh God!
You lost another set of clothes.
Why does that fat boy think taking a
blind guy's clothes is insulting him.
What difference does it
make when I can't see anything.
Yeah but it doesn't keep you
from shuting your mouth, does it?
I know you're a intelligent girl,
how is one connected to the other?
If you don't shut
that mouth of yours--
Don't fight! Get dressed quickly and
let's leave before your aunt comes.
They must be showing Salman’s film.
Yeah, it will be great fun
if it is a Salman Khan film.
- How much longer?
- Almost there.
Lagaan.
Paan Singh Tomar.
Om Shanti Om.
Is Dabang still there?
Yes.
"Donate your eyes.
Change someone's life."
Listen to me first!
And then watch the movie!
Enjoy the larger than life epic!
The name of the film is Force!
So much action that every
nerve of yours will scream in pain!
Your heart will say enough!
A story about a hard
hearted inspector!
A story about love,
revenge, gain, loss!
The brave inspector who will smash...
...and turn all his
wife's killers to ashes!
Why are you not laughing?
I am angry.
He is beating up all the goons.
Then?
He is very angry.
Goons are running towards
him and he is angrily bashing them.
He is very angry.
He's picked up a bike.
This was fun. Right?
Uncle, how did he pick up the bike?
I'll just be back.
He just picked it up.
Uncle, isn’t it great?
I know they are kids,
but don’t you have brains?
I work hard all day
under the sun.
And you’re busy smoking the pipe.
Were they distributing
tickets for free.
Now you will all pay for it,
no food for anyone today.
Uncle.
Uncle, are there any snacks
in the box?
I’ve to endure everything.
Aunty looks so crazy when she’s angry.
Have you seen her nose,
they fluff up like some cave doors.
I used to like her earlier,
but not anymore.
Uncle, why don’t you work?
Boy, I’ve a broken back.
The doctor’s asked me not
to lift weights, or stand straight.
You can’t even tell a lie.
You teach me.
Shut up you fools.
"My dear Shah Rukh Khan sir."
"Greetings."
"My name is Pari."
"I live in a village in
Rajasthan called Churu Dhani."
"I have a brother, Chhotu."
"He is blind."
"I made a promise to him that
he would see before he turned nine."
"His birthday is on second October.
There are only two months left."
"Thank you, Pari."
I can't lose today.
Shah Rukh is going to win.
Oh No!
"When I saw you I realized..."
Sore loser! Shut Up!
So Shah Rukh is from
a wealthy family...
...yet he is a good man...
...and his voice quivers
when he speaks...
Wait here. I'll be back.
Why are we stopping
at the post office?
Why must you know everything?
Just wait here.
Hello, postmaster.
Hello, how are you my dear?
I am well.
I've written a letter to
Shah Rukh Khan for Chhotu's eyesight.
TO, SHAH RUKH KHAN,
HOUSE: MANNAT. MUMBAI.
DONATE YOUR EYES.
CHANGE SOMEONE'S LIFE.
I don't have money for stamps.
If you put the stamps
I will pay you back later.
Ok.
Thank you.
Lets go.
"My fist is small but
I want to conquer the world."
Today we will learn about
the dissection of a flower.
Hold your flowers up.
"Focused towards our goal."
"Even in bad times,
we sing songs of joy."
"No matter how difficult the path is."
"Even in bad times,
we sing songs of joy."
"No matter how difficult the path is."
Can't see but you know
exactly how much to take.
"Living larger than life."
"Soaring higher in the sky."
"Dreams are still alive."
"Don't lose hope."
Dunga Ram!
Sir.
Look at this.
I put stamps on the
first few letters...
...but she brings one every day and at
some point this foolishness has to stop.
Stop lying to her.
The whole village knows that your wife
will not pay for Chhotu's operation.
Break her heart but break it once.
Chhotu, raise your hands.
Hold this.
Careful with that.
Pari, it’s heavy.
Only for sometime.
Why do you
tie me up like this?
Be quiet.
Pari...
What?
Its heavy.
Only for sometime. Lets go.
So, you'll teach Braille?
Yes.
Hello Ma'am.
Hello Ma'am.
Your teacher tells me that
you're a brilliant girl.
Thank you.
And me?
You are very intelligent.
And if you learn Braille
it will help you.
No.
I am teaching him.
What? You yourself
have failed twice.
You know I've
failed because of Chhotu.
I can take care of him
by being in the same class.
You are very good but right now
what he needs is to learn Braille.
No!
He will get his eyesight back.
I am not blind.
Shut up, both of you!
You are blind.
The sooner you accept,
the better it would be.
Pari, from tomorrow
you'll work in the fields.
Chhotu, I don't care
if you learn Braille or not.
There is no need for
her to be taken out of school.
She is a girl, she'll marry
and end up like me.
You can't think like that in today's
time. Look at me, I am a teacher.
It’ll be really good
for her if she studies.
I've had enough interference. Don't tell
me how I should look after my family.
You're a witch!
Yell all you want,
my decision is final.
You think we’re joking.
You promised you'd
never leave me. Liar!
I am going to ask Salman
Khan to come and punch aunt.
One punch and she'll
land straight on the moon.
Good idea. I think I'll
ask Shah Rukh to chip in as well.
Why do you have to bring him in?
What can he do?
This is Salman's area of expertise.
We’ll have to forget both of them.
This is a special case.
The Unbeatable Duo!
Yes. The Unbeatable Duo!
"Immerse yourself
in the ocean of dreams..."
"...and sleep tight."
"Immerse yourself
in the ocean of dreams..."
"...and sleep tight."
"Weave your dreams..."
"...and sleep tight."

"...that you could
witness a rainbow..."
"...even in the night."

"Immerse yourself
in the ocean of dreams..."
You're the world's worst aunt!
Let go!
Why did you not let Pari go?
We missed our movie!
Get lost!
Cow dung!
When I am able to see,
I am going to punch you like Salman.
- Leave me!
- Shut up!
Calm down, Chhotu. I'll
take you to the movies.
Gardu!
Gardu!
How are you my angel Pari?
I am fine.
I went to look
for a groom for you.
But bloody hell they
all looked like camels.
I'll bring a photo for you.
Whose photo?
Haven't you heard?
Your hero, Shah Rukh Khan, is
shooting on the dunes near Jaisalmer.
I am taking Phoolan.
Hey Phoolan! Come on.
But you're the real fan.
Get on.
I know Shah Rukh very well.
When he came five years ago,
I took him sweets from my house.
He will remember that
for sure, and this mustache.
See you.
What took you so long?
Who should I play with?
Wait a second.
Come soon!
Pari fetch water.
Ok aunt.
Uncle, Shah Rukh Khan is shooting
in Jaisalmer. Can you take us there?
It is a matter of life and death.
Your life, my death.
Your aunt will kill me.
We'll go without telling her.
I have to meet him. Please take us.
Jaisalmer is too far,
almost 300 kms away...
It is a two day journey.
Besides I don't have the money.
I know Shah Rukh can
give Chhotu's eyesight back.
But I am saving money
for his operation.
Why are you worried?
Enough uncle. No more lies.
I will show you a rainbow.
Rainbow? At night?
Nonsense.
"The cold breeze,
winds and the nature..."
"...makes the
evening mysterious."
"What would be the outcome..."
"...of our sorrows
and sufferings?"
"No one knows what
the future has in store for you."
"Live in the moment."
Chhotu.
"My heart says,
chase your dreams..."
"...and change your fate."
"Change your destiny."
"Let's take a step forward."
"Let's start
a new chapter together."
"Let's take a step forward."
"Let this night catch a glimpse
of a new dawn."
"Let's take a step forward."
"Let's start
a new chapter together."
"Every city, every path..."
"...we'll travel every route together."
Are you happy?
God has granted your wish.
They are out of your life.
I am sure they'll come back.
This is just to prove a point.
What should they come back for?
Stale bread, a lying uncle
or a witch of an aunt.
Don't call me a witch!
Yes you are a witch!
You made him blind.
-I am not responsible--
-You are!
And so am I.
Who let this happen.
A disease made him blind.
A disease brought about
by starvation.
I know I sit here smoking all day...
...but I got off my ass once
and took him to the hospital.
I learned that his blindness could have
been prevented if he was not starved.
Not gourmet food.
Just plain bread.
I tried to tell you but
I could never get past your hate.
Just like a man to blame
the woman for all his shortcomings.
I am not blaming just you!
He could see just fine when
I brought him home from Pushkar.
I hope to God I can find them.
It reads 'Jaitaran 51 kilometers'.
51 kilometers?
If we walk fast we
can do one kilometer in 10 minutes.
Who told you that?
Our headmaster. He talks about the
annual pilgrimage to Holy Mother's temple.
So one kilometers in 10
minutes means....
..51 kilometers in... 250 minutes!
Wrong.
1000 minutes?
Ass!
Fifty hundred mins!
There is no such number.
This is no time for a bloody
math class. What is the right answer?
510 minutes,
which is eight hours and 30 minutes.
I am going to die.
You won’t die!
Do you want your eyes or not?
Yes!
Then lets walk!
I am hungry. Can we stop?
No. We just started walking.
But I am hungry!
Careful.
It’s a tree.
"Bread in the stomach,
heads held high... "
"Bread in the stomach,
heads held high..."
"Bread in the stomach,
heads held high..."
A little curry would be nice.
Sure your lordship.
Did you bring water?
Stupid bottle had a hole,
all the water leaked out.
Now we'll both die. For sure.
We'll find water along the way.
If you're done eating, can we go?
I've just started.
Listen.
God has given us these children. Let us
treat them as our own, not my dead brother's.
Sir?
What are you kids doing
in the middle of nowhere?
Please can we have some water?
We haven't had water in days.
We are going to die.
Keep quiet.
Sir he exaggerates everything.
But we're really thirsty.
Here.
Thank you for saving our lives.
Where are you kids going?
We're headed to Jaisalmer to meet
Shah Rukh Khan to ask for my eyes.
No. We're going to Jaitaran
to see our relatives.
Why are you lying?
Do you know how crazy that sounds?
But it's the truth! Even though I don't
trust your Shah Rukh Khan I still came.
Just shut up and
let me do the talking.
That one's got a short temper.
So which is it? Jaitaran and relatives,
or Jaisalmer and Shah Rukh Khan?
Jaisalmer and Shah Rukh Khan.
Then you're going the wrong way.
Tell you what, I'll turn around
and drive you till Garnia junction.
From there you'll
have to find a tractor.
Thank you, sir.
Now get that brat before
he injures himself.
It's also been my
dream to meet Shah Rukh.
If I didn't have these tomatoes to deliver I
would have taken you all the way to Jaisalmer.
The last time they were shooting in Mumbai,
they recreated the desert there.
That time I delivered
500 trucks of sand.
500 trucks!
Shah Rukh Khan is
such an amazing actor!
Yes, I heard he plays a Rajput prince.
With a huge mustache.
I heard he's built
his body for this role.
He can do any role,
so many films and still--
- Forgive them Salman Khan...
- Shah Rukh Khan... Shah Rukh Khan...
- Forgive them Salman Khan...
- Shah Rukh Khan... Shah Rukh Khan...
Come...
..careful.
Come.
Take this, some snacks.
Take it.
Thank you, sir.
I ran away from home when I was 14...
...I am sure you have your reasons.
Be very careful out there.
Of course.
Do you want to wait
for a tractor?
No!

Stop!
Where are your parents?
They are dead. They died
in an accident in Pushkar in 2009.
Why must you give so much information?
I am sorry to hear that.
You want to jump onto this
marriage party tractor?
- Yes! Yes!
- No!
I am older. It's my job
to take decisions.
- No, it's not.
- Go ahead.
Ok, you are.
Please let's get on the tractor.
But they're all drunk.
It is dangerous.
But I am there!
I can smell sweets.
And I hear bangles so there are women.
We are safe.
Please, please.
Sir, if we come with you,
will you give us sweets?
All you can eat.
Ok.

Pari, wake up.
Where are we?
Chhotu.
Bilara.
How far is Jaisalmer?
Very far.
Spend the night here, Chhotu and I will sing
some songs and in the morning you can leave.
My pride! My joy!
This is my son, Samsher Singh.
This is Pari and Chhotu.
He is blind!
Don't call him that!
But he's blind...
You're a donkey,
but do I call you a donkey?
No, I lovingly call you Samsher.
Go, meet your new friends.
Should I give him my clothes?
He's smelling a lot.
My son is a donkey,
but his heart is in the right place.
- Take Chotu inside.
- Come!
He sang for the first time
after the death of our parents.
Stay happy!
Come on.
Raise your hands.
Sir.
No man can handle such beauty.
God bless you.
Shamsher!
Can we stay here for a few more days?
You want your eyes back or not?
We will leave early in the morning.
The last time I ate something this
tasty was in Pushkar, ten years ago.
You're eight!
I know, it was when
I was in the womb.
Chhotu, move.
Jalebi (sweet).
I can eat a 1000.
I can eat 2000.
3000!
4000!
Stop eating!
You'll get a stomach ache.
When I grow up, I am going to make a house
whose walls will be made of gewar.
And the roof will be
made of rasgulla (sweet).
And the floor with laddoos (sweet).
But then we won't be able to walk.
Who cares, we'll just sit
wherever we want and eat the laddoos.
But the windows have
to made of jalebis. Ask why?
Why?
So you can see thru the gaps.
Exactly Chhotu!
Geniuses. Both of you.
Open your mouth.
My turn!

I think you're lying. If you are blind how do
you know so much about Salman Khan?
Stupid! I was not always blind.
When I was four, I became blind over three
days. First I couldn't see in the night...
...and then during the day.
Total darkness.
The last movie I saw
was Salman Khan's Dabang.
Were you scared?
Yes. I cried a lot but
Pari held my hand always...
Girly, holding your sister's hand.
I'll punch you like Salman
if you call me girly.
I'll tell you a secret.
Don't tell Pari.
The only thing I am afraid of in the
whole world is not holding Pari's hand.
It's going to be a real
problem when she gets married.
Yeah, I hope her husband doesn't mind.
If I was her husband I wouldn't mind.
You like her?
She's cute.
Ok I'll talk to her in the
morning about a possible alliance.
Thanks, you're my best friend.
You're my best friend.
Much more than Madan Mohan.
Oh God! I am going to die.
Pari! My stomach hurts.
I think I am going to die.
Idiot! Never listen to anything I say.
If I die you will be alone.
Pari!
Should I give you one more sweet?
I shouldn't have
eaten the 1000th sweet.
Pari, please!
Get up idiots!
Now the gewar (sweet) is coming out.
Then the rasgullas (sweet)...
Even the laddoos
(sweet) are coming out.
- Fight like a warrior!
- Fight like Salman Khan!
- My heap is bigger than yours.
- Liar!
Learn to fight from me!
- More jalebis.
- Thanks, Samsher.
- Please talk to Pari about our wedding.
- Yes I will.
Go to Karperda. From there,
take another vehicle to Jaisalmer.
Take this.
Take it!
Thank you, sir.
By the way, why are
you going to Jaisalmer?
To meet Shah Rukh Khan.
What! Even I was supposed to go there,
but I got stuck with this wedding.
Shah Rukh Khan's wife
loves my sweets.
She calls me directly.
I send them directly to their home.
Careful. Climb slowly.
Be careful.
Take care.
Chhotu when you get your eyesight,
come back to Bilara.
I will! We'll build
our House of Sweets!
Jalebi windows!
Laddoo floor!

Hail Holy Mother!

Chhotu, come here.
Come here.
Hail Holy Mother!
Sir, where can we
take a bus to Jodhpur?
There's a market straight from here.
Take a right after
you go through the market.
Careful.
Puri (fried bread)!
There's the bus.
Sir, which is the bus for Jodhpur?
This one, leaves in 15 minutes.
How much is the ticket?
30 for adults and 20 for children.
Puri and shira (sweet).
What?
I can smell puri and shira.
No, this bus leaves in 15 minutes.
We're not going to take any risks.
Can you not smell those delicious
fried puris and the sweet shira?
We've not eaten all day.
Just kept yelling Hail Holy Mother!
Ladies, generally you take a vow.
That if your particular wish meets,
you will observe fast for few days.
How long is the line?
- How far are we?
- Shut up!
Jodhpur! Jodhpur!
Load it.
Ticket! Ticket!
Jodhpur!
Come on,
Jodhpur! Jodhpur! Jodhpur!
But tickets. Jodhpur! Jodhpur!
Come on. come on.
Hey kids! Stop!
Are you blind?
Oh, you're blind too!
Yes, Inspector.
Where are you kids going?
To Jaisalmer, to see relatives.
I had a blind uncle.
Nuisance.
Needed someone all the time.
I don't need anyone. Except Pari.
You are a smart ass.
Where are your parents?
Who are you with?
They're with me, sir.
I am their uncle.
Sorry I left them in the
food line and went to the toilet.
Don't leave them here and there.
Children get lost at these religious
sites and end up in very dangerous places.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Stop!
Stop the bus!
Stop!
You made me drop my shira.
Who cares, the bus is gone!
Idiot policeman. Not my fault.
It is your fault.
If we hadn't gone for the damn food.
Everything in the world you blame me.
Chhotu, if you don't shut up,
I will leave you here and go.
Now that the bus is gone,
can we go back and get some food?
Here, eat it!
Life doesn't end if you miss a bus.
There'll be another one tomorrow.
Why don't you stay at the temple
tonight and catch the morning bus.
- Are you full?
- Yes.
Let me take you to Holy Mother.
She always blesses kids.
I've been coming here for 10 years.
My wish is yet to be granted.
I am hoping she grants you your wish.
Hail Holy Mother!
Hail Holy Mother!
Ask Holy Mother for anything.
Mother, we want to
meet Shah Rukh Khan.
Who?
Shah Rukh Khan.
This is ridiculous!
Even I am embarrassed to ask this.
Ask for something useful, child.
I've been asking
for my eyes for four years...
...and nothing has happened
so I am trying a different tactic.
Come here, child.
Do you know that Shah
Rukh Khan and I were friends?
Before becoming Holy Mother,
I was an actor.
We used to do theater together.
It was great fun.
He was very energetic. I always knew
that he will become a big star one day.
I heard he is shooting in Jaisalmer. Apparently
he plays a Rajput with a big mustache.
I know he will help you.
Thank you, Mother.
Listen. When you
meet Shah Rukh Khan...
...tell him that Vibha says hello.
Vibha, Ok?
Eat this.
All you wishes will come true.
Both of you, take care.
Ok sir.
Take care.
Two kids, I think about 10 and 8.
The girl should fetch us a good price
but the jackpot is the blind boy.
You'll find them between Lohawat
and Jodhpur in the next hour.
Hurry.
Take this shortcut for 3 kms and
then take another bus to Jaisalmer.
Thank you, sir.
Careful.
Just wait here.
What happened Pari?
Sir?
Kid! Please... please... wait... stop!
I just fainted.
All I need is some water!
Some water?
Paani (water)? Please!
All he wants is water! Paani.
Just give him some water.
They're dangerous.
Remember what mama used to say.
"To quench a man's thirst is to
pour water down God's throat."
Don't lecture me.
Never mess with the desert.
One minute you're walking
along ta-di-da...
...and the next all the moisture
is sucked out of your body.
Do you know what I mean?
Bottle.
Bottle!
Of course.
Thank you. Tata. Bye.
Hey wait I have to thank you.
Thank you!
See he's saying thank you. Now
ask him for some foreign chocolates.
No, we're going!
Chocolate!
What?
- Come on Chhotu.
- Chocolate.
Oh you want candy!

Learn to trust people.
Chhotu!
Chhotu! What happened?
Chhotu.
Chhotu! What happened?
Chhotu, get up.
Idiot! Ass! Don't ever do this again!
I like this little man.
You messed up all your clothes.
Ass.
Idiot.
That's why I am here.
Thats why I am walking.
See, I am on the mission
of peace and love.
I am going to walk this world.

Dip this inside.
Biscoot. Biscoot

Give me, Pari.
It's much better
once you put it in the tea.
Hello. Hello.
My name is Pratap Sharma.
Douglas Adams. Nice to meet you.
Yes.
Where have you come from?
California.
America?
Just walking across the world.
To give love a chance!
"Give love a chance."
Yeah, you got it.
Ok, nice to meet you.
I have to go now.
Before it gets dark, I have to reach
Jaisalmer.
See, big Indian superstar
Shah Rukh Khan is coming.
Shah Rukh Khan?
Yes, I heard.
Yeah heard of that guy.
Saw Chennai Express.
Same.
Sir, you're going to Jaisalmer?
Yes, I am a huge Shah Rukh Khan fan.
Me too. We're going there.
Then come with me.
At least I'll have company on the way.
We'll get there before night fall.
Come...
No sweetheart, you go.
Farewell my little friends!
Come Chhotu.
Sit up.
The breeze is wonderful.
Yes.
Onion Samosa!
And there are some
more sweets too.
We'll take one sir?
Feel free to eat as many as you want.
Hello. I got them both.
Move the stones.
What are you doing?
Move aside, let us through.
Can't you hear? Make way.
Move the stones!
Move the stones.
We are in a hurry.
Give me your money and jewelry.
Quickly!
Is the gun real?
Want to find out?
Fine.
- Jewelry?
- No, take the watch instead.
- Give me the car keys.
- Why?
Give it.
Take this also. Can I go now?
Let us go.
Open the boot.
It's empty.
Let me decide that.
Open or this gun will talk.
I told you it's empty.
You're right. But only the people who protest
are the ones who have something to hide.
"O friends, the ornaments are hanging."
"O friends, the ornaments are hanging."
"O friends, the ornaments are hanging."
"O sweetheart,
the ornaments..."
"...are swaying."
"O sweetheart.."
"...the ornaments are swaying."
"O sweetheart,
the ornaments are swaying."
"O sweetheart,
the ornaments are swaying."
"O my sweetheart, the ornament
is so pretty and colourful."
"O my sweetheart, the ornament
is so pretty and colourful."
"O my sweetheart, the ornament
is so pretty and colourful."
"Swinging, swaying.
Swaying, swinging."
"Swinging, swaying..."
Come.
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Don't be scared.
Grandmother said there would be
two children who would need my help.
She sent me to look for you.
She can't see?
Are you blind?
Seeing is overrated.
I have a lifetime of memories that
I see in my head whenever I choose.
Come.
Come to me.
Do you want churma (sweet)?
Eat it.
You just ate bread.
If I won't eat,
she will feel offended.
Grandmother, can you do magic?
The world is full of magic.
All we have to do is look with
a pure heart and you will see it.
You’ll see magic.
But I can't see.
Not with your eyes, child, with
your heart.
From the heart.
Magic is everywhere.
Once you see it,
all you have to do is reach out...
...and grab some in your fist...
...and swallow it.
And then you will see the
magic in you.
What are you saying?
I am very confused.
When the time is right
you will understand.
How did you know we were coming?
My stones whisper
things to me.
They told me that you both have
embarked on a great journey.
Yes.
Girl, make a wish with a pure heart...
...and blow on the stones.
Can I?
Your turn will come.
Pari, I want to go to the toilet.
Pari.
Not one moment of peace.
Hurry.
Grandmother, I'll just be back.
Come on.
What did your stones tell you
Grandmother?
Something very bad will happen.
Will Chhotu not see?
He will...
...but only if you hurry.
Three days are all he has.
If you reach on time he will see...
He turns nine in three days.
Then you must hurry child.
And listen...
...a fat, strange man will help you.
Pari.
Pari.
Pari, magic is done.
"I am fearless."
JEMLA BUS STOP
Why are you laughing?
Why are you laughing?
There's a man driving
an imaginary vehicle.
That's Badrinath.
He was a truck driver.
His family got killed
in an accident a long time ago.
He went mad.
People just feed him
and clothe him along the way.
Come on, Chhotu.
Where are you going?
We're going with him.
Are you mad? He is mad!
Grandma said that, "A fat,
strange man will help you".
Good luck then.
May Goddess Kali protect you.
Bye.
Is he still driving?
Why are we following him?
What else did
Grandmother tell you?
Ask him the way to Jaisalmer.
By now we would've gotten
on a bus or a jeep or a camel.
What else did
Grandmother tell you?
God, you took away his eyes.
Why not his mouth?
What happened?
Sandstrom!
Sit.
What's going on?
Pari?
That's a big tummy.
My turn.
HAIL BIKE SAINT.
DRINKING ALCHOHOL IS PROHIBITED
You must visit our village.
My aunty is irritating
but she is a good cook.
Uncle smokes the hookah all day.
Once there was no one at home...
...so I took a drag.
I died coughing.
What have I done?
Only two days left.
O Bike Saint, please help us.
Get us to Jaisalmer.
You will have to
pray to the Bike Saint.
How many more times?
Pray one more time.
You jerk, are you a
bloody mechanic or a priest?
I would have fixed any bike by now.
It's your fault that
the bike won't start.
You made me waste five days and
now you're telling me its my fault?
If you're faith was real then
the Bike Saint would have blessed you.
I'll pray once more.
If you don't fix it by then,
I'll run you down with my motorcycle.
I will make a wreath out of the
Bike Saint's flowers for your funeral.
Pray. Pray. Pray. Bloody mechanic!
Pari!
- Gardu!
- Pari!
I finally found a groom for you but...
...but he can't even walk properly!
But what are you doing here?
Chhotu and I ran away from
home to meet Shah Rukh Khan.
Not for me, for Chhotu.
DONATE YOUR EYES
CHANGE SOMEONE'S LIFE
Where's Chhotu?
Come.
One minute.
Take this. Let’s go.
Chhotu, look who is here.
Gardu!
How are you?
I am good.
Get up!
Pari.
Not now Chhotu.
My lord, please fix it.
Listen.
What? You have to
go to the toilet again?
Badrinath can fix the bike.
He told me he can fix anything.
"A fat, strange man will help you."
You are my best friend.
More than Madan Mohan and Shamsher.
Thank you, sir.

Kids, wait here. Let me find
Phoolan and we'll go together.
- Ok.
- Ok.
What are you doing?
Don't leave them here.
Take them there.
Yes. And don't stand like this.
Take this that side.
Quickly go there.
What are you doing here?
Come on, move fast.
Go there. There.
Look what he's doing there.
Take him inside.
Come on hurry up.
Stand behind the rope.
I am telling you from a long time.
Sister.
Please go back.
What is he doing?
- Get them out of that place.
- Tell them to pack up and move.
Yes, behind that rope.
We've to go to another place from here.
Come on, finish it fast. Hurry up.
Shah Rukh Khan is leaving!
No.. no..
Stop! Stop!
Ask everyone to stay there..
Brother, is Shah Rukh Khan leaving?
They cancelled the
shooting so he's leaving.
Shah Rukh’s here.
Shah Rukh’s here.
Let's go!
Come on. Fast.
Do you recognize the footprints?
Did you recognize him?
Whose footprints are these?
He was standing right here.
Hey, watch it!
It's Shah Rukh Khan's footprints!
Don't mess it up. Get back.
Get back! Get back!
Son, I am not stopping you
from taking a photo.
Now stand there.
- What is this?
- Mug!
It is the mug Shah
Rukh Khan drank water from.
And this is my photo
With Shah Rukh Khan.
And now look at this.
Look closely.
You can see his arm around me.
I didn’t have to tell him,
he kept his hand himself.
He said, your AAK.
I am SRK.
We are friends since then.
Come! I don't have time.
I’ll keep this here,
Shah Rukh dwells in your heart.
Smile.
I am not begging,
keep it in my pocket.
Come closer.
You want to get closer to Shah Rukh.
Come on pay up, what’s that?
Did someone give you instructions
before sending you here.
Now take a look, isn’t this
a lipstick, so you just hope that…
You don’t want it? Fine.
This is your chance.
You are really tall.
I must see…look…
you’re taller than I imagined.
Wait…come here.
How are you?
Is everything all right?
See you later.
You're welcome.
Has Shah Rukh Khan
gone back to Mumbai?
Why?
We want to ask him for my eyesight.
Are you really blind or pretending?
A lot of people pretend they have all kinds of
ailments just to get close to Shah Rukh Khan.
How many fingers am I holding up?
I am 100 percent blind...
but not for long.
Which is why we have
to meet Shah Rukh Khan.
Sorry.
Listen, Shah Rukh Khan is going
to shoot in Ranau for a few more days.
How far is Ranau?
Very far.
30 kilometers by road.
There is a shortcut
but it is difficult.
Look there.
- Can you see those sand dunes?
- Yes.
If you go straight over
those dunes for seven kilometers...
...you'll get to Shivani village.
From there it is only two kilometers.
Thank you.
Are you going to walk?
We have walked across Rajasthan.
He exaggerates everything but we have
been bred in the sand. We'll manage.
Good luck.
Come.
Where are your parents?
They died in Pushkar...
four years ago...
...in a camel stampede..
along with 25 other people.
Must you give so much information?
Yes.
Now walk fast.
I am thirsty.
Water please.
Didn't I give it
to you on Gardu's bike?
You left the bottle on the bike,
didn't you?
How can you trust
an eight year old?
That too a blind eight year old?
Don't you dare use your
blindness as an excuse.
Everyone started yelling Shah Rukh,
then you grabbed my hand and we ran!
Have you once said sorry in your life?
Just once?
I never have because
it is never my fault.
You're the adult
and you always screw up.
How dare you? I am nothing
but patient with your moronic actions.
Are we going to fight over your stupid mistakes or
are we going to find your stupid Shah Rukh Khan?
God, please give me the
strength to not kill my brother.
Its not my fault. Who runs away from
home? That too for Shah Rukh Khan!
Come on.
Chhotu.
Raise your hands.
Am I a dog?
Shut up.
- Come on!
- No!
Let’s go, Chhotu.
No.
I am not a dog.
Come quietly.
Cow dung!
I think we're lost.
Are you scared?
Of course not.
You're there no?
Heads.
Bloody hell, tails.
Another Shah Rukh Khan romance.
My Shah Rukh is a prince and...
And he has a big mustache and...
And he is fighting against
the british empire...
And he has a big sword and...
And his sword is studded
with diamonds and....
And he can cut off five
heads with one stroke and...
And...
And what?
And...
And what?
And...
And what Pari?
And...
Pari?
Pari?
Pari?
Pari?
You're acting aren't you?
To punish me for forgetting the water.
Water please! For my sister.
She fainted.
Water for my sister!
Water! Water!
I am sorry, Pari.
They were severely dehydrated.
I've put them on a drip.
Bad heat stroke.
She is far worse than he is.
But they were lucky.
Pari, get up.
Pari, get up.
Pari, get up.
Pari, get up.
Pari?
- Pari?
- Chhotu.
How much longer will you sleep?
Where is he?
Who?
Shah Rukh Khan.
You've gone mad!
He picked me up in his arms in the
desert. He was dressed as a prince.
He brought us to the hospital.
And then he sang.
"Seeing you I realized my love..."
I am not making up a story.
He rescued us.
I even saw him talking to the doctors.
Some rich man found us and brought us here.
He has even paid for my eye operation.
You helped me keep my promise.
Thank you Shah Rukh!
How can you thank him?
I just told you.
You believe what you want
and I'll believe what I want.
You'll get whatever you ask for here.
I told the nurse I wanted a chocolate.
She gave it to me.
Then I asked for ice cream.
They're very stupid,
they'll believe anything.
Uncle!
Pari.
Uncle!
Chhotu.
You'll are brave adventurers. I've
been chasing you all over Rajasthan.
Lucky I met Gardu.
Then I found out
that you guys are here.
How's aunt?
She is fine.
She is waiting for you at home.
I got some biscuits for you.
This is for you.
Chhotu.
Don't trouble me Chhotu.
This gown is itchy.
Why are you laughing?
They put oil in your hair.
All flattened. You look funny.
- Is it better now?
- Yes.
We'll see rainbows together.
Rainbows in the night?
Yes.
Chhotu.
Don't be scared.
I'll be in and out in a jiffy.
"Lose yourself in your dreams..."
"As you shut your eyelids dreamily..."
"And you will see the most beautiful,
the most magical..."
"...rainbow in the night."
Doctor sir.
Yes, child.
Who was that?
That guy who just left.
Who do you want to see first?
Salman Khan.
Long Live Salman Khan!
Is Pari crying?
Ass.
Open your eyes slowly.
Give your eyes time to adjust.
Pari... rainbow.
"Come in this new world."
"Look how beautiful it is."
"Here you can explore happiness
in different ways."
"Even unfulfilled wishes
dance with joy here."
- Chhotu!
- What?
Don't look at the sun.
You just got your eyesight back.
Chhotu.
Sand is beautiful.
Yes, everything is.
Come.
"Let's take a step forward."
"Let's start
a new chapter together."
"Let's take a step forward."
"Let this night catch a glimpse
of a new dawn."
"Let's take a step forward."
"Let's start
a new chapter together."
"Every city, every path..."
"...we'll travel every route together."
- Heads.
- Tails.
Ok start your story.
All the girls in the collage are crazy
about my Shah Rukh and...
And he is a good sportsman and...
Walk slowly!
