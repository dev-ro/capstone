- Checked twice.
- And the other?
- Which one?
- Davidson's.
Thanks.
What's wrong?
Dog-tired.
Got to forget figures.
I'll take you home.
- How?
- In my car.
- Got a car?
- Yes.
- Since when?
- Yesterday.
- It's yours?
- Surprised?
A bit, yes.
Come into money?
Curiosity will kill you!
We earn the same amount,
yet I'm always short.
- Don't exaggerate!
- I couldn't afford this.
OK, I'll tell you,
but keep it a secret.
Last week, I won
a stack at roulette.
- Where?
- Enghien. A new gaming room.
How much?
1,800,000.
Not even my wife knows.
- You're joking!
- Honestly.
She must know
you can't afford this.
I said I'd taken out
a 2-year loan.
She believed me.
So, you live a lie...
I have to. I won't leave her,
and gambling's a compulsion.
- Want one?
- No, thanks.
She suspects, though.
Once, I lost a lot.
I got into debt.
I couldn't keep
the truth from her.
We had a terrible scene.
She made me swear on our kid's
life that I'd stop. I promised.
Now, I play incognito.
You can't imagine
what it's like.
- You never gambled?
- No. I don't know why.
It's a bit like drugs.
If I became an addict,
I'd be lost.
Gambling and drugs
are worlds apart!
With gambling, you keep
your lucidity.
It's very stimulating.
Come along next Saturday.
I'd rather not.
You should. You have to
try everything in life.
You might be extremely lucky.
You ought to come along.
Even if you don't gamble,
it'll interest you.
Perhaps.
Evening, Dad!
- Already 7:00?
- Caron drove me home.
- He has a car?
- He bought a DS.
- Is he that rich?
- He won gambling.
- What kind of gambling?
- Roulette, at Enghien.
He'll sell it next week.
- Why?
- Gamblers always lose.
- No money left.
- I gave you 10,000 last week.
You try doing the shopping!
You just have to
warm the soup. Good-bye.
I've known several gamblers.
They all ended up penniless.
Like Ripert.
You met Ripert?
Gambling ruined him. He wrote
dud checks, went bankrupt.
And his wife left him.
She was fed up of begging
for 50 francs.
Now he's alone.
Know what he does now?
He's a night-watchman.
There's no shame in that,
but he was a manager...
living like a prince.
You must admit it's sad.
And it didn't stop him.
He gambles in the daytime.
- Where?
- The betting offices.
If he enjoys it...
Well, I hope you never do.
If I ever hear you're gambling,
you can pack up and go.
That's smart!
As your ma said: 12 fishermen,
12 hunters, 12 gamblers...
make 36 idlers!
I've no need for an idler here.
I'm old enough to decide.
You can do as you like.
So will I.
Disaster!
- What is it?
- Yesterday, I lost a lot.
How much?
I can't tell you here.
I must win it back.
Mr. Fournier, the manager
wants to see you.
- On vacation Saturday?
- Yes, sir.
- Give Mr. Fournier his pay.
- Yes, sir.
Will you please sign here?
You must come with me Saturday.
- I need you to win.
- Really!
An intuition. Don't refuse.
- When?
- Saturday, I said.
I can't. I've lots to do.
Come, or I'm done for.
I'll try, but I can't promise.
- How much will you bet?
- 5,000, I guess.
To win a lot,
you must bet a lot.
I took all the money I had left.
Double or quits,
but I'll go all the way.
I don't even know the rules.
I'll tell you.
You'll see, it's child's play.
- I don't have a card.
- They'll give you one.
- How long for?
- I don't know.
- The minimum.
- Which is?
- Two weeks.
- I won't come back.
Don't be so fussy... Sorry!
Your ID?
Thieves, all of you!
Quiet! Don't make me call
the police. Just go!
Get off!
- I'll make a scandal!
- I wouldn't.
I'll have the place closed down!
- Please leave.
- Crook!
The manners of a peasant!
- Who's that?
- Industrialist's wife.
Big gambler.
- Why was she thrown out?
- I don't know.
She is not to be allowed
in the casino anymore.
Not very gallant.
We can't keep
upsetting our customers.
Last week, she had
a first warning.
- Was she cheating?
- Not exactly. The usual thing.
She tried to rob us twice.
Well, let's forget
this incident.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Come, we've lost enough time.
30,000 in chips of 5,000.
5,000 francs.
- In 200s or 500s?
- 500s.
You won't go far with that.
- What's that?
- A betting formula.
- What's it for?
- To anticipate what'll come up.
The minimum bet is 500 francs.
Maximum, 15,000.
I don't get it at all.
For instance, you put
10,000 on number five.
You can win 35 times your bet...
350,000 francs,
plus your bet: 360,000.
- For every number?
- That's right.
- Red, black, odd and even?
- Hang on.
- They double your bet.
- What's the point, then?
You've got a 1 in 2 chance.
With the others,
it's a 1 in 36 chance.
13, black, odd and manque.
Ah! 13!
There's also trio, split,
and square bets.
- "Split?"
- That.
2 numbers at once,
but you win half as much.
You know enough now.
You'll learn the rest
by playing.
- What should I choose?
- Now?
- Yes, we're here for that.
- 13.
It just came out.
Numbers rarely come out
twice in succession.
Do as you like.
13 for me.
It's crazy...
13!
- How much?
- 10,000.
500 is enough for me.
Place your bets.
No more bets.
33, black, odd and passe.
Well, maybe you're not lucky.
- I don't get it.
- You chose a bad number.
Seven, and 1st dozen.
Thirteen.
Don't keep playing
the same number.
13, black, odd and manque.
Just a lucky break.
It's a game of chance,
isn't it?
- Whose is the 500?
- Mine.
17,500.
Place your bets.
Twenty-four.
Are you sure?
Do as you like,
but leave me alone!
Square, 24.
Let's go. I'm about to lose.
- Stay a bit longer.
- Do as you like. I'm leaving.
480,000.
410,000.
You lacked daring.
With your luck,
you'd have won more.
- Or lost.
- You should've gone on.
I felt my luck was turning.
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing... Gambling.
I just won 6 months' pay
in under an hour.
- You can lose it, too.
- So?
How will you use it?
I don't know. A trip!
Go to the Riviera.
- Why?
- We could meet up.
Nice and Monte Carlo are great!
The stakes are
much higher there.
And it's not the same.
People live for gambling there.
I'm staying in Cannes
with friends.
I go every year to relatives
in the country.
I can't get out of it.
- Gambling's fun, but limited.
- It's nice to win a lot.
Yes...
but I feel uneasy about it.
I don't deserve that money.
I feel as if I stole it.
That's stupid!
Thanks a lot!
See you soon.
On the Riviera!
We'll see.
Your uncle has written.
They're expecting us next week.
- I'm not going.
- Why?
I want to travel.
You'll travel later. You're
young.
- Not really.
- You liked going there.
I've changed.
- Traveling's expensive.
- So you've said.
Don't count on me
to pay for it.
I'll manage.
OK, spend your savings
in three weeks. Fine!
My savings are mine.
Buy shirts instead.
Shirts? Look at that!
Dozens and dozens of shirts!
What's this?
The other day, you said...
I said I had no money?
Today, I have.
It happens.
Money can grow on trees!
- What did you do?
- Nothing bad. I gambled and won.
Up to now, I've acted
like a mild-mannered kid.
But it's over.
I need something else.
But I won't end up like Ripert.
My feet are firmly
on the ground.
And I intend to win even more.
So, Uncle can wait.
How much did you win?
500,000 in less than an hour.
It isn't any more immoral
than anything else.
No more so than poverty
or ugliness.
I won't be responsible
for your debts.
- Meaning?
- I won't have a gambler here.
- So you're turning me out?
- Go away.
- Don't say it twice.
- Go away!
A room, please.
Take the gentleman to 18.
Sir, please fill out your form.
- Are you staying long?
- About two weeks.
Where's the Promenade
des Anglais?
Two minutes away.
Straight ahead, then left.
- The casino?
- On the Promenade?
A large white building
on the right.
Are you going to gamble?
- Do you mind?
- I couldn't care less.
But pay me one week
in advance. As security.
You never know, with gamblers.
Some get ruined
and can't pay us.
I need a card.
- For how long?
- One month.
Your ID, please.
- Ever been here before?
- No.
1,000.
100,000.
- Plaques or chips?
- Chips.
- 5,000s or 10,000s?
- 5,000s.
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Thirteen.
5,000 on 13. No more bets.
12, red, even and manque.
Thirteen.
5,000 on 13. No more bets.
9... red, odd and manque.
13... black, odd and manque.
5,000 on 17 for Madam.
Seventeen.
5,000 on 17 for the gentleman.
35, black, odd and passe.
- Three.
- 5,000 on 3.
- Three.
- 5,000 on 3.
Three, red, odd and manque.
175,000 for Madam's
5,000 francs.
175,000 for the gentleman.
- For the staff.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
- You're thanking me?
- Yes.
- It's just chance.
- Lf you say so.
What should I choose?
17 has a good chance.
Why 17?
Why not?
Seventeen.
17, black, odd and manque.
175,000 for 5,000 francs.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-one.
350,000 for the 10,000 on 21.
Eight.
350,000 for the 10,000 on 8.
- For the staff.
- Thank you, sir.
- Let's go before we lose.
- But we're winning!
I'm sure of it.
850,000.
900,000.
It's funny... really funny!
What's funny?
Well, no, it's not so funny.
Well, you know,
life has its tricks...
- Its oddities. See what I mean?
- Not really.
A while ago,
I'd lost everything.
- Your money?
- Money and jewels.
Then you came.
I was on my last chip when you
advised me to bet on three.
- Ice cream?
- No, thanks.
A strawberry ice cream, please.
No, coffee. No, strawberry!
100 francs.
I couldn't even
go back to Paris.
I'd staked my rail ticket.
I mean, the money
for the ticket.
- That isn't funny.
- Yes, it is.
Want some?
It's not very good.
- Not very...
- Very what?
Not very...
Oh, nuts!
- Where was I?
- You said it's funny.
Yes, when I left my hotel,
I'd decided to go back to Paris.
I went to the station
with my bag.
I had just enough money.
When I was about to buy
my ticket, I got the urge!
I left my suitcase there
and came back here...
almost against my will.
You understand?
I gambled all afternoon.
I hoped to make up my losses.
I stupidly kept playing 17,
sure it'd win.
But I kept losing.
I thought to myself:
I can't go to Paris,
but I can go to Dijon.
Then, it was Lyon.
After that, hitch-hiking.
With my last chip,
I couldn't even go to Marseille!
So, I played and lost it!
Like Enghien.
I believe I saw you there.
You're mistaken!
I don't know Enghien,
regrettably.
It's said to be nice,
as resorts go.
- I thought...
- No, it wasn't me.
Maybe we met in Deauville.
I often went there last winter.
- I've never been.
- Then you're mistaken.
What if you'd lost
your last chip?
I've already been
in a predicament like that.
I'd have slept in the station.
I'd have gone to Marijo's.
A friend.
She helped me out twice already.
I promised her
I'd stop gambling.
- Why?
- Why what?
Why did you promise?
To reassure her.
I had no intention of stopping.
Jacqueline Demaistre.
Demaistre in one word.
Jackie to my friends. You?
Jean Fournier.
It's banal, but...
I'm laughing because I'm hungry.
I haven't eaten in two days,
except the ice cream.
I'll invite you.
If it's all right with you,
I'd like...
I'd like the best...
A terrace, a band,
and champagne!
- What a funny idea!
- Doesn't it ever happen to you?
All this is new to me.
I thought such a lifestyle
no longer existed.
Don't get me wrong. I mean...
only existed in the movies
or certain American novels.
What lifestyle?
This hotel, this terrace,
this band...
This opulence...
And you.
Me? So I'm like
an American book?
A character in a novel, yes.
That's strange.
I'd never thought about it.
I love that tune.
Do you like to dance?
I'm not a good dancer.
I want to move.
- Please!
- No, you first.
Just a question:
Why do you gamble?
It's simple.
The happiness gambling
gives me...
can't be compared to any other.
When married,
I gambled in secret.
- Did I hurt you?
- No.
Not you. Someone kicked me.
- He knew nothing?
- Who?
Your husband.
Not at first.
You know how it is.
But I've always been passionate.
Then a strange thing happened:
Pierre became jealous
of my passion. So jealous!
You can't imagine how jealous!
Perhaps you're
the jealous kind, too?
Me? Not at all. Go on.
It was absolutely ridiculous.
He begged me to stop,
but I couldn't.
It wasn't for money.
Pierre's rich.
No, pure jealousy.
Scenes, fits of anger.
Everything I hate.
It was unbearable.
So I asked for a divorce.
Thanks for indulging me!
I took all the blame.
He got custody of Michou,
my little boy.
I've got no rights.
I can just see him once a week.
I always refused
my husband's money.
Today, I could've said:
"Pierre, I'm on the Riviera.
I need money."
He'd have sent some at once.
But I don't need him.
I can manage by myself.
- You're proud.
- No, not at all.
But why drag up the past?
Look. This is Michou
last summer.
- How old is he?
- Three.
The check, please.
I don't know why, but I feel
my luck's come back.
Do you get that impression?
- What impression?
- It's hard to explain.
If I went back to the casino now
I know I'd win every time.
Come with me!
I'm going back now.
It's been a long day. I'm tired.
I promise we won't stay long.
Believe me, you must never
let luck pass you by. Come on!
500,000.
What will it be?
100,000, 50,000,
10,000, and 1,000.
500,000.
- Sir?
- 500,000.
- Same thing, sir?
- Same thing.
What does luck say?
- It says three. No?
- Perhaps.
30,000 on three.
I choose five.
- You shouldn't.
- We'll see.
Then let's play three and five.
30,000 on five.
Three...
And red.
35, black, odd and passe.
30,000 on seven.
200,000 on red.
- You're mad!
- I have to win.
And you?
Seven and red.
You seem so certain.
33, black, odd and passe.
- I don't understand...
- Play the 3rd dozen.
- Think so?
- It's obvious.
- Where are you going?
- I have to get some more chips.
31 and 35.
150,000 on black.
Three, red, odd and manque.
Take my place. I'm done.
It didn't work.
But we'll win. I can feel it.
300,000 in plaques of 100,000.
Give me 50.
- He tried to cheat.
- How?
Ask the croupier.
He tried to steal
a pile of chips.
Calm down, please, gentlemen.
The game's going on.
- What happened?
- The croupier said a name...
and one man took
another one away.
Seventeen.
Black.
Eleven.
Black.
Nineteen, red, odd and passe.
- That's that.
- What?
- No chips left.
- No more money?
I changed it all. And you?
Me, too.
How much is left?
30,000. And about as much
at the hotel.
Lend it to me.
Your 30,000.
You'll lose it.
You've got more at the hotel.
I'll reimburse you.
You can't.
You'll lose it.
How do you know?
We're both unlucky. Let's go.
Lend it to me!
Ask the casino for a loan.
I can't ask them
for any more money.
I can't give them
enough security.
Then stop gambling.
I must win. I'm broke.
I admit I was imprudent.
I swear I'll repay you tomorrow.
I'll bet on 23.
I'm sure to win.
- You're stupid.
- Thanks!
23... quick!
23, red, odd and passe.
- You're hateful!
- Forgive me.
- Now lend it to me.
- What number?
- Seventeen.
- Why?
Don't argue. Give!
Seventeen.
30,000 on 17.
Nine, red, odd and manque.
Let's go.
- What a dope I am!
- We can't help it.
I get had every time.
I'll never gamble again!
You're just saying that.
Come off it.
I forced you to,
you were tired.
I was undecided.
No, you're just saying that.
Gambling is stupid.
I behaved like a lunatic.
I'm furious.
Forget it.
I'm thirsty.
Can we afford a scotch?
I've got some change.
Five, six, seven... 730 francs.
Nothing.
Oh, yes! 1,000.
We're saved!
- How much?
- 1,500 francs.
We can't afford another?
What will you do?
You've made me yawn, too!
I'll go and sleep.
I could go to Marijo's.
It's a bar like this.
All bars are alike.
She'd have no room
for me, anyway.
No, I'll go to the station.
- The waiting room!
- You know?
A little.
I'm really sleepy.
We'll get your bag from the
station, then go to my hotel.
I'll rent you a room.
You'll sleep better there
than on a bench...
between a cop and a soldier.
That's so nice of you!
There's no bell.
Nobody in here.
Don't wake everybody up.
I'll sleep in an armchair
in your room.
We'll save money.
Make yourself at home.
There are coat hangers.
Here's the armchair.
Do you often sleep
in strange men's rooms?
- I know you!
- I might be a con man.
What would you get out of me?
I'm broke.
As for the rest, I'm not shy.
I guessed as much.
What does it mean to "know"
somebody? I'm here with you.
I could be with another man in
another room. My husband, say.
I don't know him
better than you.
So him, you or another...
I don't care!
That the bathroom?
May I?
When I'm broke,
I play by myself.
I've played for whole days,
in hotel rooms.
And whole Sundays.
- Never done that?
- No, never.
- Why?
- I'm not a real gambler.
- When did you arrive?
- This morning.
- On vacation?
- Yes.
It needs ice.
I could try to
have some sent up.
Forget it.
I see a Sioux's head.
Where?
There...
The feathers, the eyes...
Don't you?
No.
What a kick I got!
Well, they're ruined!
I lied to you earlier on.
I know Enghien very well.
I was banned
from the casino because...
None of my business.
You really
don't want to know?
No.
Give me the courage
to leave tomorrow!
I dreamed you were leaving.
When I woke up,
you weren't there.
For a moment, I didn't know if
it was a dream or not.
What did you feel?
I don't know... Nothing.
You're frank!
I mean, it felt kind of funny.
Don't be stupidly sentimental.
I would've said good-bye first.
Have you
made your mind up?
Yes.
I'm going back to Paris.
What time is it?
12:30.
- Breakfast?
- I haven't got time.
No. I'm going to see Marijo.
Not at her bar... at her place...
Well, her boyfriend's.
Then, I'll go to the station
to wait for my train.
- Want some money?
- No, don't worry.
Marijo will take care of that.
A strange girl, Marijo.
She was a big gambler.
One day, she had enough.
And she was very brave...
Are you listening?
She made the casinos ban her.
She wrote to
some state department.
I could never do that.
Pretty good, huh?
Yes... Let me do that.
I admire her.
When she was too tempted,
she went to Italy.
But as the trips were expensive,
she stopped gradually.
Now she's running that bar.
I've got everything...
Thank you. Good-bye, Jean.
I may not see you again.
- Want my address in Paris?
- Lf you like.
4 Rue Louis-le-Grand.
- Near the Opera.
- Yes, I know.
Good-bye!
I'll be on the beach. If you
have time before you go...
Yes, perhaps.
I never thought
you'd come back.
Nor did I.
And yet here I am.
I waited for Marijo.
She was still asleep.
When she came with her guy,
we had to chat.
I didn't want him to know.
After he left,
I had to do a lot of talking.
She said she had no money
on her. Lies, of course.
In the end, I got
20,000 francs out of her.
Then I walked to the station.
Why did you come back?
To see you before I left.
To see me or to have
a last gamble like yesterday?
I don't know.
I wanted to stay here longer.
Here or Paris...
what's the difference?
You have to be somewhere.
No one's waiting for me.
At least the weather's good.
What about Michou?
I've got the feeling
I gambled him away.
Anyone waiting for you?
No, no one.
What do you do?
- Meaning?
- Work-wise?
A bank.
I give chips away, like here.
Live alone?
With my father. Ma's dead.
You don't want to get married?
I was engaged, once.
But at the last moment,
I got scared.
I saw what I'd turn into.
I saw an average life,
without any risks or surprises.
So I broke it off.
These pebbles are
so uncomfortable!
Sit on this.
Staying here?
Why? You want to go?
I might make up
some of my losses.
Suppose I win 100,000.
Not asking for much, am I?
With 100,000, I swear I'd quit
gambling and go back to Paris.
What do you think?
What can I say?
- Coming along?
- No, not now.
Tonight, maybe.
I'll be long gone.
Now's the same as tonight.
I've one week paid at the hotel,
and 30,000 francs.
This display of flabby flesh
makes me sick anyway.
I'd rather look at gamblers.
Won't you come?
Just to see.
You'll lose
your ticket money again.
- I'm not mad!
- Then leave it here.
No, because
I'm not coming back here.
Good-bye!
Three.
5,000 on three.
Red.
Six, black, even and manque.
- Going?
- I lost my ticket money.
Now leave me alone!
Excuse me.
- Want a seat?
- No, I'm just looking.
I'm hesitating
between 22 and 28.
What do you think?
Do you have a favorite number?
- Yes, 17.
- Really?
- I assure you.
- Take this.
Go on, play for me.
- Seventeen.
- 10,000 on 17.
Do you gamble often?
Sometimes. You won all this?
Yes, I've been lucky.
11, black, odd and manque.
- But you're not.
- Sorry.
Our luck may turn.
Come have a drink on me.
Gladly.
- 20,000.
- 1,000s or 5,000s?
5,000s.
Sit down.
He got the message!
- You know him?
- No.
You had a good time.
- What?
- Forget it.
- 23, red, odd and passe.
- Yes!
350,000 for the 10,000 francs.
Your luck's come back.
- Slut!
- What?
I said: "Slut!"
Don't make a scene.
You're disgusting!
- 32, 33, astride.
- Don't do that!
1st 12, straight eight
or square bet.
Eight.
- 300,000 on black.
- Eight.
So you're a hustler?
He gave me a chip.
For a chip,
you'd walk the streets.
Quiet!
Eight, black, even and manque.
Don't pull a face. Smile.
Or else I'll leave the table.
You won't smile?
No, stay!
Forgive me.
1st or 3rd 12?
The 1st 12, 6 and black.
- 20,000 on 6.
- Six.
- 200,000 on black.
- Black.
Six, black, even and manque.
For the staff.
Red and one.
Red... and one.
One...
two...
three million...
Four million...
And one... two hundred thousand.
Thank you.
Lucky I've got my suitcase!
When you think everything's
lost, your luck returns!
- My suitcase!
- It's here.
I was worried!
I must absolutely
go to Monte Carlo.
- When?
- Now.
- It's 3:00?
- 4:10.
It's stopped.
I left my jewels in Monte Carlo.
What a fuss!
I sold them. For a low price.
I couldn't do otherwise.
I owed the casino a lot.
At times like that,
you don't think.
Now I can get them back.
Above all, there's a pair
of pretty diamond earrings.
I also had a necklace,
but I never wore it.
- What?
- You amuse me.
- Did I say something silly?
- No.
Know Monte Carlo?
You must come with me.
Its casino is
one of the finest.
I know.
- So you'll come?
- Lf you like.
I've no evening dress.
It's optional, but it's smarter.
You need a tuxedo.
You'll see,
we'll live the high life.
Know the Hotel de Paris?
Of course not, since
you've never been there!
- You're quiet.
- You're not!
Because I'm happy.
It makes me... versatile.
No, voluble. Is that the word?
Ah, the Hotel de Paris!
There's no finer hotel.
There's no point
in staying here.
Let's go, then.
It'd be nice to have a car.
- I get you.
- Why?
Listen: If you buy the car...
I'll pay for the Hotel de Paris.
- Is that fair?
- It's fair.
You can find some very nice
second-hand cars here.
Just what we need.
- 1,200,000.
- So what?
A room for two.
No, darling, take a suite,
with a terrace.
We'll be more comfortable.
Look, Jean! It's marvelous!
I'm happy!
- Coffee.
- Madam?
Nothing, thank you.
Which one?
- That one.
- You think so?
You asked for my opinion.
Yes, you're right.
I'll go get my jewels tomorrow.
You like this luxury?
What luxury? Here?
What you call the high life.
Yes and no.
It amuses me sometimes.
But I don't mind not having it.
It doesn't bother me.
But you gamble for money...
No! I don't like money.
You see what I do with it
when I have it.
If I loved money,
I wouldn't squander it.
Gambling attracts me...
by its stupid mixture
of luxury and poverty.
And also the mystery
of numbers...
chance.
I often wondered whether God
ruled over numbers.
- You don't believe in God?
- No.
- Ever wondered about it?
- No, never.
The first time
I entered a casino...
I felt as if it was a church.
I had the same emotion.
- Don't laugh. Try to understand.
- I'm not.
I tell you, gambling
has become my religion.
Money means nothing to me.
Nor this robe, this room.
Nothing.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
One chip is enough
to make me happy.
As for the rest...
- And the others?
- Who?
Your husband, your friends?
I don't owe anyone anything.
Why deny myself this passion?
In whose name? I'm free!
No! I don't need your pity.
I don't deserve it.
What am I for you?
Am I nothing other
than an object to you?
Haven't you got a heart?
Look at me!
Never do that again.
You've no rights over me. None!
We're partners
in a game, that's all.
Forgive me.
I don't want any
misunderstandings between us.
We mustn't mix our feelings
with a situation...
that is hard enough for me.
Then why are we both
in this room?
Why are we living together?
Well?
- I don't want to hurt you...
- Too late!
I thought you'd understood.
Well?
Answer me!
You're hurting me.
Well?
You want to know?
Why I drag you behind me
like a dog?
You bring me luck,
like a lucky horseshoe.
Forgive me!
What did you bet on?
33, and black.
Nine, red, odd and manque.
See? When you're not here,
I'm unlucky.
Take the 1st dozen.
Three only came up once.
Three, if you like.
Three.
10,000 on three.
13, black, odd and manque.
Here, change this for me.
600,000.
How do you want it?
10,000s, 50,000s and 100,000s.
Another table.
The croupier has the evil eye.
17-19.
Odd.
- What did you pick?
- Two and black.
12, red, even and manque.
Let's go home.
We must win tonight.
I'll put all
I've got left on five.
- Eight has a good chance.
- Why?
I don't know why, but I feel
eight will come up.
- Eight.
- Eight.
Black.
Five, red, odd and manque.
Let's go.
- Nothing left?
- No. And you?
- 5,000. Should I gamble it?
- No! Come along.
- I lost 900,000 francs.
- And me, 700,000.
Nine plus seven is 16.
That's 1,600,000 between us.
We should've left.
I was sure
eight would come up.
Fournier! I never expected
to see you here.
Caron, a friend. Jackie.
Glad to meet you.
- When did you arrive?
- Today.
I'm at the Carlton, at Cannes.
I'm pleased to see you!
Just a minute!
I won two million at Cannes.
I hope to double it here.
You caught the bug, too,
you rogue?
How's your luck?
I won a lot last night,
a bit less today.
- How much?
- Almost 3,000,000.
Wow! Congratulations.
So long, pal.
Bye, Miss.
Come and look me up.
Wait for me!
- How much have you got left?
- 1,000 francs.
Can I have another scotch?
Yes, just one...
Waiter, a scotch.
Forget it.
Money! What's money, after all?
- I'm sorry now.
- Why?
If I'd bought back my jewels,
I could have sold them tomorrow.
We'll have to sell
the car to pay the hotel.
- Why not?
- I took precautions.
Lend me 100 francs.
What precautions?
I've got 100,000 francs
at the hotel.
You're wonderful!
You think of everything.
Lend me another 100 francs.
Money for another scotch,
darling!
Tomorrow, we'll return to Nice.
The Bay of Angels
brings us luck.
The same room?
If possible, yes.
Number 18, wasn't it?
It seems ages
since we left this room.
The Sioux is still there.
I've been had.
You knew I kept it
to pay for the hotel.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'd have given it to you.
You wouldn't have!
I wouldn't have had to
sell the car.
The guy saw I needed money.
What you did hasn't
a pretty name.
- Meaning?
- It's called theft.
Do you mind!
We won that money together.
And I wanted to surprise you.
Win a pile.
Nice surprise! Now we're broke.
- How much have you got?
- 360,000.
That's OK, then!
- We can win millions.
- What if we lose?
- We'll cheat.
- Done it before?
Yes.
At Enghien twice,
but I was spotted at once.
I don't know...
I could make eyes
at the croupier.
It'd be easier
than forging chips or bills.
But croupiers are incorruptible.
They can't cheat anyway.
- How do you know?
- Try it and see.
I'm ready.
- You're serious?
- Are you afraid?
Yes. Of ending up like you.
I'm waiting.
I swear it's
the last time I'll gamble.
- Even if you win?
- Even if I win millions.
- What's up?
- That's the way it is.
Croupier, 26.
10,000 on 26.
I think it'll work.
The 3rd 12, croupier!
20,000 on the 3rd dozen.
I think it's working.
Ten, black, even and manque.
- I don't think it is working.
- Too bad.
The 3rd 12?
30-32.
And red.
- You surprise me.
- Do as you please.
60,000 on 4-8, square bet.
60,000 on 4-8, square bet.
- That's stupid.
- Charming!
He's not even looking at you.
35, black, odd and passe.
- That all you've got left?
- Yes.
I'm out.
- Do I bet it, or not?
- Bet it.
- Got any money?
- 10,000 at the hotel.
- It's your fault.
- Why?
You trusted the croupier
too much.
I'll play 17. My lucky number.
12, red, even and manque.
We won't go far with 10,000.
- Someone could help us.
- Who?
- Caron.
- Who?
- The pal I met at Monte Carlo.
- Oh, that tall guy.
I'll get him on the phone.
The Carlton, at Cannes.
- Know the number?
- No.
I'll go up and rest.
Hello? The Carlton?
No, I'll hold.
Mr. Caron.
Caron left this morning.
Where is he?
He didn't leave any address.
- What's wrong?
- I have a headache.
Can't you ask Marijo?
She was much too nasty
last time.
I wouldn't accept
a cent off her.
I refuse to see her again.
You said she owed you money.
She did, once.
Now it's the other way around.
So you lied to me!
Don't shout!
I don't feel at all well.
Your husband?
He refuses to give me anything.
He is rich.
But I'd rather beg than ask him.
When you said he'd help you,
you were lying?
Yes.
Why?
I don't know.
Crying?
It's nothing.
At times, I feel ashamed.
I feel rotten inside.
I fight it,
but it's stronger than me.
I lie. I betray.
- I spoil everything.
- That's not true!
What are we going to do?
I'll write to my father.
If I send him a nice letter,
he'll soften.
I'll admit I was wrong.
I'll say: "Dear Dad,
our quarrel grieved me a lot.
Forgive me for having
caused you pain..."
See, I'm no better than you...
You have a note
from the Post Office.
It's for a money order.
I couldn't sign for you.
There's a letter, too.
- Yes!
- What?
- Dad sent money.
- I'm happy for you!
You bought fruit?
What fine peaches!
And olives, apricots,
and grapes.
You're an angel.
We can go to Paris tomorrow
on the night train.
That's sweet, but I won't
go back to Paris with you.
- But you said...
- I changed my mind.
- Why?
- It's not easy, you know.
Sure, we could live together
and be happy for a while.
But what for?
I could never stop gambling.
So what's the use?
Let's part on good terms.
Let's avoid useless
scenes of grief...
hard words... and much sorrow.
But I love you!
I know, Jean.
Do you love me?
Yes, Jean.
But not in the same way.
I need you!
And I can help you.
Together, we'll fight
to get over this.
We will be happy.
I wish I could believe you.
Well... it's a fine idea,
but it's impossible.
I know myself. It's too late.
"Too late?"
You sound like a novel!
Call it what you want.
For the last time,
please think it over.
- Where are you going?
- To the Post Office.
- Are you mad at me?
- A little, yes.
"I am sending you 50,000 francs.
"Come back home
any time you like.
"I won't ask any questions."
Seen Mrs. Demaistre?
She left right after you.
She'll be back.
She left her bag.
Where is she?
I don't pay attention
to what the guests do.
- You could've left a note.
- I didn't have time.
- Twenty-three.
- 30,000 on 23.
2nd dozen.
- I'm going back to Paris.
- I won't stop you.
- You had no money left.
- My watch.
Want to bet?
- Come with me.
- No, Jean.
Where will it all end?
Come on... come with me.
Nine, red, odd and manque.
You're making me lose.
Go away!
