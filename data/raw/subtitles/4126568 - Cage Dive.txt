     [man 1] Are you ready?     
  [man 2]                       
  Okay, one, two, three, jump.  
       [steady breathing]       
   [female reporter]            
   Twenty-seven people          
   sailed away from this dock,  
   they were looking forward    
   to a great day together,     
   when suddenly things took    
   a turn for the worse.        
       [male reporter]          
       High drama at sea,       
  a shark cage dive exhibition  
  was capsized earlier today.   
     Dumping everyone           
     into the chilly waters.    
   An urgent search and         
   rescue mission is underway   
  after a shark dive boat was   
  capsized by a freak wave      
off the South Australian coast. 
       Leaving passengers       
       and crew stranded        
   in shark infested waters.    
 [male journalist] An           
 unsuspecting group of tourists 
     and an experienced         
     shark cave diving crew     
   headed out today for         
   what was supposed to be      
   a routine and fun day trip.  
     The dive site had          
     been baited to attract     
  Great White Sharks,           
  some up to 19 feet in length. 
 No one could possibly predict  
 what was to happen next.       
     Eye witness accounts       
     indicate that the boat     
      was hit by some kind      
      of a freak wave.          
   [male journalist] In the     
   middle of their cage dive    
   rough seas struck            
   washing everyone on board    
  into shark infested waters.   
      This time without the     
      protection of a cage.     
     In a second we saw         
     this big wave coming.      
 [male journalist]              
 Among the people missing are   
 three friends from California. 
 Police and rescuers            
 are holding out hope           
 they can still be found alive. 
 We will find those             
 missing persons                
and bring them safely to shore. 
         [upbeat music]         
   Let's go and find            
   some treasure, shall we.     
     [man] I've been diving     
     here in Australia now      
     for the last 10 years.     
    Went with a few friends,    
    we all went to Adelaide.    
And I'm just having a nice dive.
My buddies are elsewhere,       
    I was following a           
    couple of tropical fish     
    and I saw something.        
          I was amazed.         
  It was a camera and I think,  
     "What's a camera doing     
     down on the ocean          
  10, 20Ks out from the shore?  
   [man 1] What have we got?    
  [man 2]                       
  Told ya we'd find something.  
   I opened it up, had a look   
       and the SD card          
       had been preserved.      
   I put it into my computer,   
    started looking through     
    some of the footage         
    and, uh, there was three    
    American people.            
      - [man] There we go.      
      - Hey.                    
- [man] Dude, this looks sweet. 
- Good quality?                 
  [Josh]                        
  Yeah, it'll be perfect, bro.  
  - Does it make me look good?  
  - Yeah, you look wonderful.   
      This has got a            
      photo function here.      
      Fabio, why don't          
      you give me a pose?       
       Hold on.                 
       Everybody hold on.       
[man] This isn't a movie, man.  
        This is the one         
        that got Megan.         
   [man] Don't worry, folks,    
   he's only my half-brother.   
        [camera clicks]         
  That's why you're only half.  
     [man laughs]               
     Here take this, joker.     
      [man] What are you        
      going to do for us?       
  I don't have to do anything,  
  Jeffery. I ooze excellence.   
 [Jeff] Hey, cool shirt, dude.  
     - This is my               
     go to Australia shirt.     
     - [camera clicks]          
     - That'd be good for       
     the surface caves.         
     - Is that deep enough?     
Well, the cage dive is,         
like, it's a surface cage dive. 
         Not very deep.         
    [Jeff] Oh, dude,            
    I left the tub running.     
   This battery's pretty low.   
    [man] Yeah, I know I        
    haven't charged it yet.     
 [Jeff]                         
 Whoa, it's going to over flow. 
   [man] When did you           
   start the bath? Yesterday?   
 - [Jeff] All right, we ready?  
 Here we go.                    
 - Okay.                        
             - Yo!              
             - Hey!             
           All right.           
    [Jeff] We're in here.       
     - Hey, you look nice.      
     - Hi.                      
        [camera clicks]         
   Oh, you got a new camera!    
   It's really good.            
   - [man] It works perfect.    
   - Awesome, cool.             
Hey, um, did you                
hear from Greg yet?             
    Is he cool with picking     
    us up from the airport?     
  [Jeff] He is, that he is.     
  He emailed this morning.      
All right, well, I got back from
work and I need to shower.      
   You guys need to vamoose.    
   [Jeff]                       
   Oh, do you need a hand or?   
         No, I'm okay.          
            [beeps]             
      [Jeff] I'm rolling.       
- [Josh]                        
Okay. So here's our show, guys. 
- [Jeff] Oh, no.                
 [Josh]                         
 What I've been talking about,  
   is an extreme and            
   intense reality game show    
  - looking for crazy people.   
  - [Megan] Crazy people.       
    [Josh] I thought you        
    guys would fit right in.    
- [Jeff] Oh, look, 100,000 dude.
- [Josh] I told you so, right?  
    [Megan] Are you serious?    
   [Josh] Yeah, we're gonna     
   have fun and it's going to   
   make us rich.                
   Step one, we make a seven    
   minute audition tape.        
      Why we work together      
      good as a team            
 and why they should choose us. 
 And so then I'll edit it       
 together and we'll upload it,  
      but it's pretty much      
      as simple as that.        
     I'll take care of it.      
  There you go, baby brother,   
  get your pump on.             
           Rocky it.            
           [laughing]           
   [Josh] Okay, let's set up.   
             Hey, how you doing?
             My name's Josh.    
       - And I'm Jeff.          
       - And I'm Megan,         
       and we're from...        
[all] Laguna Beach, California. 
              USA.              
            - Yeah!             
            - USA.              
      [Josh] There we go.       
 - All right, did we get that?  
 - There it is.                 
             Whoo!              
    [Josh] Framing out,         
    getting on camera here.     
         Our next stop.         
   - The star of our            
   little adventure, Jeffery.   
   - What are you doing?        
  [Josh] I'm capturing B-roll,  
     that's what they call      
     it in the business.        
Just capturing moments, buddy.  
Well, it said in the application
      that you can't have       
      a medical condition,      
so you might wanna delete that. 
[Josh]                          
That's something I did not know.
I can do that.                  
    [chattering indistinct]     
      [Jeff clears throat]      
  We're going to take you on    
  our journey from California   
     all the way to Sydney,     
     Australia.                 
        [Josh whooping]         
  [Jeff] Where we're going to   
  meet our cousin, Greg.        
     There he is.               
     Handsome looking guy.      
     And then we're going       
     to travel to Adelaide      
     to film our most           
     extreme activity yet.      
       Shark cage diving!       
       Check it out.            
          Here it is.           
   [Josh] Look at the size      
   of that frickin' shark.      
        [Megan] Look how        
        close they get.         
          [screams]             
          Oh, my God!           
     - Oh...!                   
     - You are such a jerk.     
     Why would you do that?     
    [Jeff] How are you going    
    to handle the sharks?       
 [Megan laughs]                 
 I can't even handle my coffee. 
I found out that they were      
trying to make an audition tape.
  I thought, "I'll post some    
  of these on social media."    
     See if I can find the      
     owner of this SD card,     
      send it back to them.     
          [screaming]           
         [upbeat music]         
You get that, Josh?             
           [yelling]            
           [cheering]           
          Oh, for me?           
           [cheering]           
  - [Megan] I love this spot.   
  - [Jeff] Yeah.                
      Remember when we had      
      our first date here       
      three years ago?          
     That's why I brought       
     you back here on this      
     beautiful night,           
      that's why I'm            
      getting it on film.       
   Sometimes you're romantic.   
        [music playing]         
   You're terrible with that.   
[Jeff chuckles] Oh, I like this.
          ¶ Hey, baby ¶         
   ¶ I know the thing I love    
    [Megan] So you going        
    to turn the camera off?     
            Hmm?                
[Jeff] Just after I             
take off your panties.          
        [Megan laughing]        
        Turn it off.            
          Turn it off.          
             Okay.              
   [radio host]                 
   KLSE FM in HD Los Angeles.   
    [woman]                     
    Have you got everything?    
     Please, both of you,       
     now be really careful      
     when you dive.             
       - Promise me.            
       - [Jeff] We will.        
       - Please.                
       - [Megan] Always.        
         Don't miss your flight.
[Megan] You got my bags, baby?  
  - [Jeff] Yup.                 
  - And watch your medication.  
  - Okay, yes, yes, I already   
  showed you I have them.       
  - I know, I know.             
I love you.                     
      - Bye mom.                
      - Be really careful.      
        [Jeff] Love you.        
Josh, please watch him.         
  [Megan] OK, we got to go.     
  We got to go.                 
   [Josh] We're gonna           
   miss the plane, come on.     
   Farewell, California,        
   you have treated us well.    
      [Greg] I got an email     
      from my cousin, Josh,     
      and he said that Jeff     
and his girlfriend, Megan, were 
going to come over to Australia.
   We haven't seen each         
   other since we were kids.    
             Hello!             
  Where are you going, Jeff?    
   Greg, Greg come over here.   
   Come here.                   
     Look, these are your       
     cousins from America.      
  [Greg]                        
  So I was like this is great.  
This is my chance to reconnect. 
    [Megan] We just arrived     
    in Sydney, Australia.       
   We're about to meet Greg.    
          - [laughing]          
          - [exclaims]          
 [Megan]                        
 Like they've never been apart. 
   - Welcome to Australia.      
   - Thank you, thank you.      
         Oh, he comes on strong,
         I love it.             
           [laughing]           
Let's go, let's rock and roll.  
Let's go, let's go, let's go.   
           [whooping]           
           We are....           
              Wow.              
  [Greg] I just wanted to get   
  into having some fun times.   
 I just wanted them, while      
 they are here in Australia to, 
    you know, fall in love.     
[laughs]                        
Are you ready?                  
Are you ready?                  
   - [Megan] Are you serious?   
   - [Greg] Here we are.        
         [Megan] What?          
      Are you kidding me?       
              Hi.               
      [Jeff] Uncle Pablo.       
       And this is Josh.        
     - Do you remember him?     
     - Josh, Josh.              
         - Pablo...             
         - Little Josh.

     [Greg] I'm going to        
     put you on that island     
  for a couple of days          
  and see if you can survive.   
        [Jeff] Dude, I          
        would love that.        
  ¶ Waking in the moonlight ¶   
       ¶ Just enough            
       so it feels right ¶      
       ¶ Like it should ¶       
    ¶ Oh, she gets me good ¶

       favorite letter?         
        [Megan] Arrrrr.         
      You think it'd be,        
      but it'll be the C.

      [Josh] Don't eat me!      
      [yelling indistinct]      
       Me, Josh and Jeff        
       are up on there          
   and Megan's in the water,    
   completely alone.            
    [Megan] All right, guys,    
    I'm ready. Go for it.       
           Okay, go.            
   [Greg] Three, two, one!

    [Josh] Let's go again!      
       [Megan] All right,       
       I'm coming in now.       
    [Greg] Wait, there,         
    we're going to go again.    
         [Megan] What?          
    And, you know, something    
    wasn't quite right.         
    [Megan] What?               
    I can't hear you. What?     
         - [all] Megan!         
         - What?                
          [screaming]           
       [muffled yelling]        
         [Megan grunts]         
        - [Megan] Whoa!         
        - Dude...               
That's saying good day to us.   
         [all laughing]         
   [Greg]                       
   You should see your faces.   
        It's huge, bro.         
   [Greg]                       
   You should see your face.    
     You looked so excited.     
   [Megan] I can't believe      
   how close they got.          
      That is incredible.       
     [Greg] That's awesome!     
    [Josh] Oh, man, do they     
    always come this close?     
   [Greg] Oh, look at those     
   two getting too close.       
           [laughing]           
    Another one coming out.     
[all] Oh, my God, look at that! 
        [all exclaiming]        
   [Josh] You're kidding me.    
 [Jeff] Greg, you're a legend.  
    [Megan] I love your hat.    
        That's me happy.        
     [Greg] So after we come    
     back from the boat         
       I sort of organized      
       a little party.          
  You know, a chance that we    
  could all have a few drinks   
     and let loose              
     and have a bit of fun.     
         [upbeat music]         
   [Jeff] Do you know what      
   we do with empty cups        
   around here?                 
      We're on the              
      same page, brother.       
           [cheering]           
     [chatting indistinct]      
           [cheering]           
   [Jeff] Let's hit the pool.   
          [screaming]           
     [Megan] Do you             
     guys love each other,      
   is that what's happening?    
     I love you, man.           
     No, but honestly,          
  I just wanna say thank you,   
  for not only tonight,         
  everything else you've done   
  for us the past couple days.  
       [Megan] Yeah, man.       
       You're amazing.          
 [Jeff]                         
 Josh wants to thank you, too.  
           [laughing]           
     [Greg] Well, she saw       
     Josh's picture online.     
    She was very interested.    
    [Jeff] Megan, you           
    getting this on camera?     
      Batteries are             
      running out on this,      
       I'm just going to        
       put it on charge.        
       [Megan] I thought        
       it was charged.          
 Here's a little secret         
 for the producers of the show. 
   Another reason why I         
   think you should choose us   
   is because I plan to         
   propose to my future wife,   
   Megan, on the show.          
       She doesn't know         
       anything about it.       
   And, um, just to show you    
   how serious I am,            
   I already got her a ring.    
        - I plan to--           
        - [Megan] Jeff.         
         Just a minute.         
         [Megan] Jeff?          
           [knocking]           
  [Jeff] Hey, what you doing?   
  [Megan]                       
  Uh, your mom's on the phone,  
  she wants to talk to you.     
             Cool.              
       I'm just going to        
       I need a minute.         
              Oh.               
              Hey.              
                           Sh...
 - What are you doing in here?  
 - What are you doing in here?  
Come on out and let's go party. 
No, I just, um, I need a minute.
Okay?                           
   What are you mad about...    
   are you jealous?             
         Yeah, no, just don't   
         flatter yourself. Okay?
 You are jealous aren't you?    
Look, hey, hey, she's out there 
and I'm in here with you. Right?
       This is... This is crazy.
       He's right outside.      
       It is crazy, okay,       
     seeing you and Jeff        
     together all the time.     
     I can't touch you,         
     I can't talk with you.     
  Don't you feel the same way?  
           We can't talk        
           about this right now.
   - Okay, he could come in.    
   - Just wait.                 
              Yep.              
   Yeah, no, she's just here.   
   Hey, Mom says, hi.           
   No, um, she's pretty good.   
       - [mother] Jeff...       
       - Yeah.                  
   I'm really not comfortable   
     with you doing this        
     shark cage dive thing.     
     Mom. I told you,           
     it's going to be fine.     
I'll call you afterwards, okay? 
     [mother] Have you been     
     taking your medicine?      
 Yes, I have been taking them.  
  [mother] Okay, can you        
  just call me straight after?  
  I was contacted               
  and I heard about the         
  video recorder being found.   
  And in my head I'm thinking   
  they've survived.             
   There's going to be a clue   
   to it on the video tape.     
      [Josh] Thanks for         
      everything brother,       
 [Greg] Thanks for stopping by  
 I really appreciate it.        
    - Love you, man.            
    - Have fun shark diving.    
     - [Megan] Oh, we will.     
     - [Greg] Don't you         
     get eaten all right?       
   - [Megan]                    
   I'll try not to get eaten.   
   - [laughing]                 
     Thanks, Greg,              
     man, you're a legend.      
  - It was really my pleasure.  
  - [Megan] Bye.                
    [Greg] Get home safe.       
         [all] Whee!            
     [Josh] We've arrived.      
     Welcome to Adelaide.       
      [makes eerie noise]       
    Oh, dude, I can do          
    the Hitchcock with this.    
      [makes eerie noise]       
      [Megan indistinct]        
    [Josh] Did you see that?    
       ¶ This is summer ¶       
    [Jeff] Wait, wait,          
    wait Port Lincoln hotel?    
     - [Josh] This is us.       
     - [Megan] This is it.      
Hey, they've got Sharky's Bar.  
This is it?                     
    Calypso shark bay dive.     
 That's it, tomorrow that's     
 going to be us right in there. 
          [screaming]           
   You're such a... asshole.    
     [Jeff] You look            
     sexy when you're wet.      
          Yeah, right.          
        [Josh] Look out.        
           [screams]            
- Man, what'd you do that for?  
- Dude, are you serious?        
             What?              
    [Jeff] Hey, Josh, Josh.     
    Hey, I wanna quickly        
       show you something       
       while Megan's out.       
       Yeah, sure, buddy.       
 Here's a little secret         
 for the producers of the show. 
       What is this, man?       
You should choose us is because 
       I plan to propose        
       to my future wife,       
       Megan, on the show.      
       She doesn't know         
       anything about it.       
   This is, this is for real?   
 [Jeff]                         
 Yeah, dude, look at the ring.  
   I already got her a ring.    
          I plan to...          
[Jeff] Whatever happens Megan   
can't find out about this, okay?
She almost came in here at      
the end and ruined the surprise.
 Wow, man, I can't believe it.  
       Oh, that's right,        
       it kept recording.       
        Hey, Jeff, Jeff.        
        Thank you, man.         
    Wow, so you've been thinking
    about this a while?         
I've been thinking about it     
probably the last four months   
or something                    
and after the three             
year anniversary I just thought,
     you know, that was so      
     perfect and why wait.      
    And I wanted to tell you    
    about it first so...        
   Well, dude, I'm glad you did.
   I'm happy for you, man.      
                     It's great.
      But with the video,       
      if you don't mind,        
   editing it and putting it    
   into the audition tape.      
     Oh, yeah.                  
     Hey, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.     
           Don't worry          
           about that now, dude.
 We'll figure it out, but let's,
  let's go get a drink          
  or something. Let's celebrate.
    You're getting married, man.
  [Jeff]                        
  Don't fuckin' high five me.   
  Love you, dude.               
     [Jeff]                     
     All right let's do it,     
     your shout?                
    [Josh] Yeah, obviously.     
   [Jeff] Oh, wait,             
   I just forgot the camera.    
    [Josh] Oh, yeah, buddy,     
    I got it.                   
 Ah... the dawn of a new day.   
   That's we're we are headed   
        Yeah, I watched         
        all the footage.        
          [screaming]           
I don't know if it's the right  
thing to show it, or whatever.  
     Josh... kept filming.      
        [Josh] Hey, hey.        
        Shark Cage Dive?        
              Yup.              
         [phone rings]          
     [Megan] Look at that,      
     there it is.               
  My name's on the list, yo.    
    - My name's on the list.    
    - [Megan] VIP list.         
  [Josh] Yeah, spelt my         
  name wrong but that's okay.   
  [Megan]                       
  Hey, it's such a good day.    
  And there it is.              
    I have, like, excited       
    butterflies in my tummy.    
   My name's Andrew, I'll be    
   your skipper for the day.    
    The trip down to            
    Cape Catastrophe            
    should be pretty smooth.    
     [continues indistinct]     
      Go down together          
      like in the Titanic.      
      And blow on this          
      whistle hard enough,      
     apparently, the sharks     
     will run away as well.     
      [speaks indistinct]       
       [Jeff] No turning        
       back now, boys.          
          The skipper.          
        [dramatic music]        
     [narrator]                 
     The ocean is beautiful.    
   [Josh]                       
   Come here, check this out.   
    [narrator] And meant to     
    be enjoyed by everyone.     
      The chances of dying      
      from a shark attack       
  - are just one in 900 million 
  anywhere in the world.        
- [Jeff] Wow I didn't know that.
  [narrator]                    
  However on rare occasions     
  shark attacks have happened.  
        There are a few         
        things you can do       
to avoid an unlikely encounter. 
    Splashing and thrashing.    
 Sharks are attracted to        
 erratic movement in the water  
   as it replicates the         
   signal of distressed fish.   
       Don't swim at dawn,      
       dusk or night.           
      These are the             
      typical hunting times     
   for most species of shark.   
 [Jeff]                         
 Well, let's not do that then.  
      [narrator]                
      Avoid swimming alone.     
       If you're swimming       
       with other people        
       don't separate           
       far from the group.      
  Sharks are more likely to     
  attack solitary individuals.  
     Sharks can sense blood     
     from .25 miles away.       
Okay, so this is Josh,          
and he is signing away his life.
   [Josh] Okay, so entering     
   and exiting the water        
  and shark cage with a         
  possible presence of sharks,  
   - hopefully,                 
   that's why we're here...     
   - [Megan laughing]           
  ...which are unpredictable    
  and dangerous                 
 exposing me to attack, which   
 may result in injury or death. 
  [Megan] Right, but there's,   
  like, a huge great cage.      
    I can see it from here.     
I think, you know what, I think 
we're going to be all right.    
I think we're going to be okay. 
[Jeff] What the hell is that?   
      Would a great white       
      fit through that?         
           [laughing]           
       Well, if it can          
       fit through that,        
    I don't think we got        
    nothing to worry about.     
  - [Megan]                     
  This is the fun part right?   
  - [Jeff] Yup...               
  [Megan] Did you know that...  
  [indistinct]                  
  [Jeff] Yeah... [indistinct]   
   I don't see anything yet.    
    [Megan] Huge one            
    on the other side, man.     
     - There is a huge one.     
     - [Josh] Right now?        
        [man indistinct]        
      [Josh] Oh, my gosh.       
          Oh, my gosh.          
          Oh, wow.              
     [Jeff] We're going         
     to need a bigger boat.     
 All right, guys, in the event  
 you do something really silly  
     and fall out the cage,     
   there's a couple of things   
   you gotta remember.          
     So, basically, if you      
     happen to do that,         
you keep your two feet together,
      you pull the stomach      
      wide open, okay.          
      Feet together             
      and these two tabs.       
When you pull that, the         
weight belt will release, okay, 
   and it will come straight    
   off you like that.           
[Megan] Who's going in first?   
     [Jeff] So long, buddy.     
    - [Megan] Good luck.        
    - [Jeff] Here he comes.     
      He was just angry...      
 [Josh] Here he comes. Look.    
      [Jeff] Oh, you            
      can see him coming.       
  [Megan] Oh, that's so scary.  
  [Jeff] Hey, that was lucky.   
   It bumped the cage, man.     
 [Jeff] Yup, it was just knock, 
 knock anyone in there?         
   I'm having a panic attack,   
   I can't see.                 
      [Josh] She did well.      
Shark diving ain't for everyone.
  [Josh laughing] I guess not.  
      [Megan] I'm actually      
      a bit nervous now.        
   [Skipper] Take a big deep    
   breath, hold your nose...    
   breathe through that.        
    Take a big deep breath.     
           [cheering]           
 [Megan] My heart is racing.    
      [Josh] Yeah, Megan.       
   [Skipper]                    
   How you going, all right?    
       You're all right.        
      She hasn't even           
      seen the shark yet.       
      [Josh] Get in             
      the water with her.       
    - [Skipper] That'll do.     
    - [Jeff] Thanks.            
  [Skipper] Yeah, no worries.   
  So, do you want me to         
  record you going in?          
     It should be recording     
     right now, bra.            
    [Skipper] Yeah it is.       
           Eh, buddy.           
        [metal slamming]        
        [metal crashing]        
       [muffled yelling]        
        [metal slamming]        
           [groaning]           
        [metal creaking]        
          [screaming]           
[Josh]                          
Dude, the boat's going down...  
   [Megan breathing heavily]    
      [Megan] Oh, my God!       
           [gasping]            
      [Jeff] Are you okay?      
         Are you okay?          
   [girl hysterical babbling]   
       Are you guys okay?       
We're coming.                   
[girl] There's a lot of blood.  
     [Jeff] Keep his head       
     above the water, okay?     
           [mumbles]            
        [Jeff] Oh, shit.        
     Just pull it together      
     Apply some pressure.       
         [girl crying]          
 [Jeff]                         
 I'm going to check his pulse.  
There's no pulse.               
  You're going to have to       
  get out of his blood, okay?   
       [girl indistinct]        
       Get away from me!        
       Get away!                
     [Jeff] You have to         
     get out of the blood.      
    It's not fine,              
    I'm bleeding everywhere.    
    [Jeff] It's okay,           
    Megan, it's only blood.     
  Josh, can you see anything?   
          [screaming]           
 - [Josh] Oh, shit.             
 - [Megan] Did you see that?    
      [yelling indistinct]      
 [Jeff] Megan, it's all right.  
It's not okay!                  
We were in a cage before!       
          [Jeff] Help!          
    [Josh] It's all right,      
    Megan, just relax.          
 - Oh, my God.                  
 - [Josh] Shut up for a second. 
     - Help!                    
     - Seriously,               
     shut up for a second.      
      - Quiet, quiet.           
      - Somebody help us!       
   - Quiet! I hear something.   
   - [yelling in distance]      
        Hey! Hey, buddy.        
        - What happened?        
        - Over here!            
  - [Josh] What happened?       
  - There was a freak wave.     
  - [Jeff] Can you swim to us?  
  - [Megan] We're over here!    
[Josh]                          
There's something in the water. 
         What happened?         
    [all yelling indistinct]    
          [screaming]           
    [Josh] Oh, shit! Megan!     
 My name's Josh,                
 and I'm here with my brother,  
        Jeff, and Megan.        
   We're in South Australia.    
   Our boat... Our boat sunk,   
     I don't know how           
     many people survived.      
        [Megan] Stop it.        
 I don't want to hear this okay.
   Just turn the camera off.    
    In South Australia,         
    we're waiting for help.     
         [Megan grunts]         
    [Jeff] Megan you, okay?     
  [Megan] No my leg's hurting.  
     Can you please check?      
    Okay, I'll have a look.     
     Josh keep an eye out.      
       It's not too bad.        
         It looks fine.         
        I'm bleeding.           
        Is it bleeding?         
               It's a small cut.
[Josh] Oh, shit. I'm just going 
to look under water...          
             Jeff.              
      - Jeff, look,             
      there's a boat, man.      
      - [Megan] What?           
 - [Josh] Yeah, way out there,  
 - [Jeff] Where's the boat?     
        Oh, shit. Help!         
         [all yelling]          
    [Megan] I don't think       
    they can hear us.           
   [Josh] Let's swim for it,    
   come on.                     
I can't swim that far.          
I can't swim that far.          
                           Help!
       [Josh] Hey, Jeff,        
       Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.        
       Come here, take...       
       I'll do it.              
   I'm gonna go first, dude.    
         [Megan] What?          
      [Josh] Jeff's gonna       
      stay here with you.       
       Wait, No, No Josh.       
       Josh, don't go.          
      - Stay here with us.      
      - I can make it.          
  Please, didn't you see that   
  guy just get eaten before?    
      Yeah, which is why we need
      to get out of the water.  
   No, if you go by yourself    
   they will get you.           
We have to stick together,      
okay, come on.                  
    - [Jeff] Josh go for it.    
    - What?                     
      You're okay with him      
      just swimming off?        
  [Jeff] We got to,             
  we got to take this chance.   
We have to stick together.      
No, come on.                    
Stay with us.                   
Another one's                   
going to come, okay.            
      [Jeff] You could've       
      had that, Josh.           
   [Josh]                       
   The Coast Guard will come.   
   We can't separate, okay.     
 [reporter] A freak wave        
has capsized a shark dive boat, 
  throwing everyone over board  
  into shark infested waters.   
 There were a number of         
 injuries ranging in severity.  
    And also we can confirm     
    several fatalities.         
The rescue effort is continuing 
and we have a handful of people 
 who are not accounted for.     
  - [chopper blades whirring]   
  - [Jeff] Can you hear that?   
     [speaking indistinct]      
        This is insane.         
  What are we doing out here?   
       You all right?           
      [Josh indistinct]         
    - [coughing]                
    - I can't swim anymore.     
         I'm so tired.          
     [Jeff] You just got        
     to relax, okay, Megan.     
     [indistinct]               
All right, it's the only way    
we're going to get through this.
 Look, just lie on your back.   
    It will help you float.     
    Lean back.                  
          Here you go.          
[Josh] I'm going to keep looking
for the helicopters.            
          [screaming]           
          What is it?           
  - What was it, Megan?         
  - [Megan] I felt something.   
         It touched me.         
       [Megan screaming]        
       Oh, my God!              
   [Josh]                       
   Oh, it's a piece of bait.    
           [yelling]            
        - [Josh] Jeff!          
        - [Megan] Jeff!         
  [Josh] Stay together, guys.   
   [Megan] Did you see it?      
   Did you see where it went?   
 [Josh]                         
 I'm going to go check it out.  
     It's gone, it's gone.      
          [indistinct]          
  [Josh] It's okay, it's okay.  
       I saw it swim off.       
     What the hell is that?     
    [Megan] What is that?       
     - Can you see?             
     - [Jeff] I don't know.     
   We need to get out           
   and float on that thing,     
   whatever it is.              
It's definitely coming this way.
  Come on, come on swim to it.  
       [muffled dialogue]       
      [relieved laughing]       
             Yeah!              
           High five.           
         - Thank you.           
         - Oh, my God.          
Oh, my hands.                   
    [Josh] Frickin' salt.       
 In an hour or two,             
 Coast Guard's going to be here 
      and this will be          
      just a crazy story.       
      Just a crazy story.       
 [Jeff] You're going to be      
 pulling all the chicks, Josh,  
- telling them about this story.
- [laughing]                    
      [Josh] You know it.       
   There's no way               
   I'm not using this story.    
      I'm going to get          
      free beer for life.       
         [Megan] Guys.          
  And I'm going to tell all     
  the girls that you saved us.  
   [Megan] Guys, will you...    
   will you just shut up        
   for a minute?                
 Just stop joking around okay?  
[Josh]                          
Megan, we got to stay positive. 
   [Megan]                      
   Stay positive about what?    
   [Jeff] Megan, you've got     
   to conserve your energy.     
   We're going to get through   
   this aren't we, Josh?        
 - [Josh] Yeah.                 
 - We're gonna get through it.  
     Fucking hands though       
     are getting eaten up.      
 [Jeff] Right? Come on, Megan.  
        You don't have to be    
        all scared all the time.
What are you kidding me?        
We're probably being            
circled by sharks.              
     Let's talk about what you  
     wanna do when you get back.
   [Josh] Oh, just, you know,   
   go to McDonald's.            
      - [chuckles]              
      - Just eat a burger.      
   [Jeff] You wanna eat a       
   burger when you get back.    
 What do you wanna do, Megan?   
        [groaning]              
        Megan, what do you wanna
        do when you get back?   
     [mumbling indistinct]      
 [Megan] Oh, that's so cold.    
         [motor sound]          
    - [Jeff]                    
    Where is it coming from?    
    - [Megan] See it?           
 [Josh] It's getting louder.    
     - [Jeff] I can see it.     
     - [Josh] Where?            
    - [Megan] Up there.         
    - [Jeff] Right up there.    
 - [Megan] I see it.            
 - [Jeff]                       
 It's like a little white one.  
 [Josh] Oh, it's way too high.  
    [Jeff] It's all right       
    it's probably just          
    scouting out the area.      
    - [Josh] He'll be back.     
    - [Megan] Hey!              
   [Jeff] Megan, he's not...    
   Megan, he can't see us.      
       - [Megan yelling]        
       - Megan, Megan.          
     - [Jeff] Megan, relax.     
     - Then help me!            
            - Hello!            
            - Megan!            
 [all talking over each other]  
      Stop laughing at me!      
This is not fucking funny, okay.
We need to get rescued, right?  
      You got to help me.       
     - [Jeff] We can barely     
     see the... Megan!          
     - Help!                    
We can barely see the plane,    
they can't see us.              
   Gosh, just saying relax.     
   [Josh] It's okay, Megan.     
   It's all right.              
          [Megan] We at least   
          have to try, you know.
      Like, do you even         
      want to get rescued?      
  [Jeff] Yeah, I do.            
  I wanted to get to the boat,  
  but you said no.              
       We can't split up.       
         [Megan] Jeff?          
What's wrong,                   
can you say something?          
        [mutters softly]        
Are you okay?                   
You okay?                       
Is it your heart?               
     - Do you...                
     Do you need something?     
     - I'm fine.                
     - I'm good, I'm good.      
     - You sure?                
   [Josh] Megan leave him be.   
       I'm just going           
       to lie on my back.       
  [Megan] Okay, we got you,     
  I got you, Jeff, it's okay.   
[Megan] I hope they get here.   
     [speaking indistinct]      
           Oh, shit.            
         - [Josh] What?         
         - Josh...              
 [Jeff]                         
 See that... heading out there? 
 Josh, can you zoom in on that? 
     [speaking indistinct]      
  [Jeff] I'm gonna go for it.   
    [Megan] No, Jeff, Jeff,     
    stay here. Come on.         
 - [Jeff] Megan, it's okay, no. 
 - Stay with us.                
        You can't swim,         
    Josh and I, we're not       
    going to leave you here.    
      So you stay here.         
      I'll be right back.       
[Josh] No, that's too far, bro. 
[Megan]                         
I think it's coming here.       
I think it's coming towards us. 
[Josh] Yeah, wait, wait, wait.  
   [Jeff] It looks like the     
   current's working for us.    
   - [Josh] Jeff!               
   - [Megan] Jeff, come back.   
   [Josh] It looks like the     
   current's working for us.    
  Let's just wait and see if    
  it gets a little bit closer.  
             Guys.              
      [Josh] It's not           
      going anywhere fast,      
      it's gonna be             
      coming right to us.       
 [Megan]                        
 A few more minutes, all right? 
    [Jeff] All right, guys,     
    it's close enough for me    
    to make it, all right.      
  It drifted in close           
  but now it's floating off.    
      I'm going to get it.      
     No, you can leave it       
     a couple more minutes.     
    No, we can't miss this.     
    We missed the boat.         
     I got the life vest        
     and that's been great.     
     [Megan] I know but         
     I can't swim any more      
 and we have to stick together, 
 Come back, come on.            
 - Megan, look.                 
 - Jeff, come back right now.   
Megan, there could be           
food and water in there.        
We don't know how long we're    
going to be out here for, okay. 
   I'm not staying out here.    
   I'm just going to get it,    
   I'll be back.                
      [Megan indistinct]        
  [Megan] No, Jeff! Jeffery!    
        Do you see him?         
        I can't see him.        
    Where'd he go? Jeffery!     
      Jeffery, come back!       
           Jeff. Do you see him?
   - [Josh] Jeff!               
   - [Megan] Are you okay?      
     [Josh] You okay, man?      
  [Jeff] I thought I was going  
  to make it the whole way.     
   [Megan]                      
   Jeff, come back right now.   
   [Josh]                       
   Maybe just leave it, man.    
       I'm almost there,        
       guys, just let me.       
   - [Megan] Jeff, come back!   
   - [Josh] Jeff!               
    [Megan] Oh, shit,           
    I can't see him anymore.    
         - [screaming]          
         - [Josh] What?         
         - Jeff!                
         - [Josh] Shit!         
- [Megan] Jeff!                 
- [Josh] Jeff, get out of there!
    - [Megan] Jeff!             
    - [Josh] Come back, man!    
  [Megan] Where is it Josh?     
  Where did it go?              
      [Josh] I don't know,      
      I don't know.             
           Oh, shit!            
       [frantic shouting]       
  [Megan] Jeffrey, Jeffrey...   
   [Megan and Josh yelling]     
  - [Josh] It's okay, Megan.    
  - [Megan] Jeffrey!            
       [Megan crying]           
         [yelling]              
   [Josh] You son of a bitch!   
Dude, I'm...                    
What the hell's wrong with you? 
    [Jeff] I'm sorry, guys.     
        [Josh] Oh, geez.        
       [thunder crashing]       
     [Megan] Is that            
     lightning over there?      
      [Jeff] We gotta come      
      up with a strategy        
 to make it through the night.  
           Oh, shit.            
       [thunder rumbles]        
     It looks pretty dark.      
     I think there's a          
     bad storm over there.      
       At least we've got       
       this life vest.          
  [Megan] It's not going to     
  do much if nobody comes.      
I know, I know. It's all right, 
we can do it, Megan.            
                     I love you.
         [Megan crying]         
Just turn the                   
camera off, okay?               
Please just turn it...          
turn it off.                    
   [Josh] Just wait,            
   we said we were going to     
   document everything,         
 - it's for the audition tape.  
 - What do you mean?            
       You want to film         
       us dying out here        
    so someone can find it.     
   - [Josh] No.                 
   - Please just turn it off.   
 - [Jeff] Yeah, I guess, Josh.  
 - Please.                      
             Does that thing...?
          It's got night vision,
          we can use it so      
          maybe just save it.   
          [Josh] Yeah.          
[Jeff] You see anything, Josh?  
      [Josh] I see, like,       
      a flashing light.         
   A helicopter or something.   
      Some kind of rescue.      
   [Megan] To me it looks       
   like they're flying away.    
[Josh] They don't... I think    
they stop the rescues at night. 
    [Megan] What?               
    Why would they do that?     
      [Megan indistinct]        
      [Josh] It's, uh...        
   Guys, we just got            
   to stay here where we are.   
        Take care of each other.
        Get through it.         
   [Megan] Oh, it's so cold.    
     What are you doing         
     with the camera, Josh?     
       [Josh] I thought         
       I heard something.       
       Hey, what is that?       
         [Megan] What?          
   [Josh] Stupid night vision   
   isn't working.               
  [Megan] Oh, my God            
  is that a shark? Oh, my God.  
     - [Jeff] Shh...            
     - [Megan] No, no, no.      
     Oh, my God!                
      - [Josh] Jeffrey.         
      - [Jeff] It's okay,       
      it's nothing.             
 - Josh, what can you see, man? 
 - [Josh] Straight ahead, man.  
   There's something floating   
   right...                     
 It just floated right past us. 
  [Megan] Wait, wait, wait.     
  Jeff, Jeff, come back.        
  - [Josh] Grab it!             
  - [Megan]                     
  Jeff, Jeff don't go too far.  
   [Josh] Shh... Get it, man.   
  - [Megan] What is that?       
  - [Josh] Bring it over here.  
    [Megan]                     
    Jeff, please be careful.    
   [Josh]                       
   Hey, man, I can't see you.   
       - Did you get it?        
       - [Megan] Jeff?          
      - [Megan indistinct]      
      - [Jeff] Oh, shit!        
        - [Megan] Jeff?         
        - [Jeff] Got it.        
        I'm coming back.        
      [Josh] He's coming.       
       - You shitting me?       
       - Oh, my God.            
     - [Megan] Really?          
     - Look at this thing.      
   [Megan]                      
   Oh, my God, are you okay?    
       [Josh] Oh, my God.       
     - What does it say?        
     - [Megan] Oh, my God.      
   [Jeff]                       
   I think it's a life raft.    
         Four persons.          
  [Josh]                        
  Oh, shit, you're right, man.  
 "To operate,                   
 throw overboard and pull line. 
              Yes!              
       - [Megan laughing]       
       - We're saved.           
  Pull the line.                
  Just pull the fucking line.   
 - [Jeff] One...                
 - [Josh] You need me to help?  
[Jeff] It keeps pulling through.
I'm gonna pull it again.        
        - [Megan] Okay.         
        - [Jeff] Okay.          
        One, two, three!        
         [air gushing]          
           [cheering]           
  Are you getting this, Josh?   
     [Josh] It's like a         
     fucking bouncy castle.     
           [laughing]           
        - [Megan] Look!         
        - Whoa!                 
   - [Megan] Oh, my God...      
   - [Jeff] We have a castle.   
 All right, what do you think?  
 [Josh] Get up in there, man.   
     Think it's got             
     a barbecue in there.       
 - [Megan] Get in! Oh, my God.  
 - Maybe... a case of beer.     
           [laughing]           
    - That thing's fuckin--     
    - [Megan screaming]         
   [Megan] Is that normal?      
   It's like hissing now.       
[Jeff] It's okay, I think       
it's a gas cylinder filling up. 
       [Megan] Oh, my God       
       it's fucking huge.       
[Jeff] I'm going to get in it.  
    [chattering indistinct]     
     Don't let me kick you.     
     [Megan yelps, laughs]      
   - [Jeff] All right, Megan.   
   - Whoo!                      
   [Josh]                       
   Get her up in there, dude.   
            Come on.            
 I shot gun the king size bed.  
 - Josh, you get the bunk bed.  
 - Here, Jeff.                  
      - Jerk.                   
      - Take this...            
      Take the life vest.       
           [mumbles]            
[Jeff]                          
Megan, you wanna start the fire?
    [Josh] Take the camera.     
    - [Jeff] Look at this...    
    - [Josh] Jeff.              
       Jeff, get me the         
       fuck out of here.        
             Jeff.              
     Jeff! Take the camera.     
      - Take the camera.        
      - [Jeff] Sorry, bro.      
      [Megan] Oh, my God.       
     - Whoo.                    
     - [Megan] Oh, my God.      
          There it is.          
         - There it is.         
         - Oh, my God.          
So, basically, we got enough    
food to last us quite some time.
We've been on the open water    
for a few hours now,            
I'm not sure for                
how long right now.             
But we came across a life raft. 
We're doing okay now.           
Um... We got some supplies here.
[Megan] And even some flares.   
How good is that?               
 [Josh] Yeah, that's awesome.   
 Just be careful with those.    
    But we got...               
    Jeff, what we got, man?     
 - Give me the lowdown, here.   
 - [Jeff] We got smoke signal.  
   [Josh]                       
   We got some smoke signals.   
   - [Jeff] Water. We got...    
   - [Josh]                     
   Emergency drinking water.    
     We got protein, Josh.      
     You can keep in shape.     
      - [laughing]              
      - If you'd like to.       
     [Megan] First aid kit.     
      - First aid.              
      - [Josh] All right.       
         [Megan groans]         
      Oh, don't film that.      
      That's just gross.        
           [groaning]           
     Please turn the cam--      
            [beeps]             
     [Josh] Okay, hold it,      
     hold it, hold it.          
 I wanna make sure I get this.  
           [laughing]           
    Okay, Megan's going to      
    set off our first flare.    
  [Jeff]                        
  Make sure it's pointing up.   
   [Megan] It's pointing up.    
     [Josh] Okay, on three,     
     you ready?                 
[Megan laughing] Yeah.          
  [Josh And Jeff] One, two--    
        - [loud hissing]        
        - [both] Whoa!          
         [Megan] Whoa.          
 [Josh] Hey, there she is.      
 Bright light pointing us home. 
      [Jeff] That's cool.       
  [Josh] Whoo! If this isn't    
  survival skills to get us     
  on the show,                  
     I don't know what is.      
           [laughing]           
  Look at it.                   
  Someone's going to see that.  
        [Josh] For sure!        
     [Jeff] Yeah, at this       
     time tomorrow morning      
 we're all going to be          
 enjoying Vegemite sandwiches.  
 [Josh laughing] I'll take it.  
            [beeps]             
           [sniffing]           
   [Josh] Jeff, did you fart?   
  [Megan] Oh... who did that?   
    [Josh] Who's farting?       
    Jeff, was that you?         
   - [Jeff] It was me.          
   - [Megan] Oh, that stinks.   
 [Josh chuckles] ...you stink.  
        [Jeff] Shh, shh!        
       Can you hear that?       
    Josh, take a look, man.     
     [Megan] Oh, my God,        
     do you see something?      
          Oh, my God.           
      [Josh] I can't even       
      see him anymore.          
[Megan] Oh, God, we missed it.  
       [camera beeps off]       
  [Josh] So we've been waiting  
  a few hours now for help      
     and we haven't             
     seen anything, but...      
    [Megan]                     
    No one's going to come.     
  [Jeff] Yes, they are, Megan.  
We're hoping that               
tomorrow morning                
if we can just                  
hunker down here...             
We'll just ration our water     
and food for a couple days,     
we saw a helicopter             
earlier today.                  
I'm sure they'll be back.       
Hopefully, we'll be             
seeing somebody tomorrow.       
       I just wanna leave       
       something behind.        
          Something...          
  ...because we might           
  not get out of this, and...   
           [whimpers]           
             Mom...             
       ...and Dad, and...       
Julian, I love you guys so much.
            My God.             
    And I know I made a lot     
    of mistakes, and...         
  I'm hurting both of them...   
       ...but I know what       
       I need to do now.        
 If we get out of this,         
 I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix it. 
           [rustling]           
        [loud thumping]         
   Wake up, wake up,            
   what was that, seriously?    
      [Jeff] Was that you?      
  [Megan] There's something     
  pushing against the side.     
    [Jeff]                      
    Did you bump against it?    
[Megan] No, it wasn't me,       
there's... It's still happening.
 There's something still there. 
        [Josh] Hold up.         
      [Megan] What's that?      
Are you sure you felt something?
       [Megan screaming]        
         Oh, my God.            
         It's a shark.          
   Oh, my God. Do you see it?   
   Did you see where it went?   
        - Over here.            
        - [Josh] Where?         
 [Jeff] Guys, don't all         
 come to one side. Be careful.  
         [all yelling]          
       [water splashing]        
    [Jeff] Josh! Josh, dude!    
   - [Megan] Are you okay?      
   - Give me your hand, man.    
    - Give me your hand!        
    - Get me up!                
        - [Jeff] Josh!          
        - [Megan] Josh!         
     [Jeff] Climb up, man.      
  - Climb up!                   
  - [Megan] Come on, quickly.   
     [Jeff indistinct]          
     ...there's something.      
    [Josh] Oh, shit.            
    Give me the flashlight.     
          [panting]             
  [Jeff] Oh, it's a person.     
  [Josh] Hey! Hey, here, here,  
  here, hold the light.         
       I'm going back in.       
   [Jeff] Hey, Josh, Josh.      
   Be careful, man.             
        Josh, you okay?         
          [indistinct]          
       [Megan indistinct]       
  [Jeff]                        
  That's it, Josh, you got it.  
  - [Megan] Is she okay?        
  - [Jeff] Megan, take this.    
   [Josh] Okay, get her out.    
   Get us out of the water.     
   [Jeff] That's it, buddy.     
      [Josh] Grab her,          
      grab her, grab her.       
           [grunting]           
  [Megan] She's so cold, man.   
      [Jeff] Hey, sweetie,      
      can you hear me?          
   What's your name?            
   Do you know where you are?   
          [Megan] Hey.          
[Josh]                          
Hey, does she have a pulse, bro?
      [Megan] Tell me she       
      has a pulse, please.      
     She's so cold. Jeff...     
       Yeah, yeah, guys,        
       she's got a pulse.       
      She's got a pulse         
      but it's very weak.       
      Just got to warm          
      her up first, okay.       
      It's just gonna....       
  [Megan] It's not working,     
  she's not waking up.          
  We got to do something else.  
    [Jeff] Just keep            
    rubbing her legs for me.    
   [Josh] Whoa, whoa, what      
   are you doing with that?     
 We got to do something, Josh.  
She's not waking up, and I don't
know what else to do.           
   [Josh] We're going to do     
   what we can, but we're not   
   going to use that flare.     
   Someone's going to see it.   
  Someone's going to save us.   
[Josh] No one's going to see it.
Think about the first flare.    
- Someone will see it this time.
- Dude, dude, Jeff...           
     [Jeff] Josh, stop her.     
   - Megan, listen to us.       
   - I don't care about her.    
           I care about you     
           and I care about Jeff
    and you're going to frickin'
    screw us all by doing this. 
It's going to                   
save all four of us.            
        - No, it's not!         
        - Yes, it is!           
   - [Josh] You're not          
   even thinking straight!      
   - I am thinking straight!    
      - We're doing this!       
      - [Josh] Megan!           
Watch where you're pointing--   
         [loud hissing]         
         [screaming]            
      [yelling indistinct]      
- [Josh] Get away!              
- [Megan] She's still in there! 
 [Josh] It's too late for her.  
          [screaming]           
  [Megan] Oh, my God!           
  Josh, she's still in there!   
      [yelling indistinct]      
        [Josh] Get back!        
          [exploding]           
     [Jeff] No, no, no, no!     
   [Megan] What did we do?      
       [Jeff] No! Dammit!       
           [coughing]           
   [Megan] Jeff, come back.     
   Baby, please.                
      - He's gone!              
      - [Josh] I told you!      
   Megan. I told you            
   to leave the flare alone.    
   - Look what you've done.     
   - [Jeff] Leave it, Josh.     
   [Megan]                      
   I just wanted to help her.   
          [Megan sobs]          
         [Josh] Megan.          
             Megan.             
             Megan!             
   Stop, you're freaking out.   
  [Megan] Turn the camera off.  
  I don't want this recorded.   
           [mumbling]           
 - [Jeff] Dude, chill.          
 - [Josh]                       
 Dude, she's freaking out, man. 
 [Megan] What are you doing?    
 Are you kidding me? Josh!      
  [Josh] Relax, okay,           
  it's the best tool we have.   
 I'm not going to turn it off.  
      You're freaking out,      
      you're not thinking.      
  [Megan] Why are we even       
  out here? This is so stupid.  
We are stuck in the middle of   
the ocean because of you, Josh. 
  [Josh]                        
  Are you frickin' kidding me?  
  You're the one who set off    
  the flare in the life raft.   
   [Megan] Because you're       
   the one who wanted to do     
   this stupid audition tape.   
      Now we're in the          
      middle of the ocean.      
And we're going to die out here.
    [Josh] We all decided       
    that we were going to       
    do this together, okay?     
- [Jeff] Josh, Josh, Josh relax.
- [Megan] Oh, stop lying.       
   - It was always your idea.   
   - [Josh]                     
   She's freaking out, man.     
   [Megan]                      
   This was always your idea.   
  - [Josh] Stop splashing.      
  - [Megan]                     
  Don't touch me right now.     
      Okay, just get off.       
[Jeff]                          
You're going to attract sharks. 
      [Josh] You're the         
      frickin' liar, okay?      
  [Megan] What?                 
  What do you mean with that?   
      [Josh] Lying to me,       
      lying to yourself.        
    - You're lying to Jeff.     
    - [Megan] What?             
     [Josh] Just... just...     
     just calm down,            
     just shut up               
     for two seconds, God.      
Wait... Wait what do you mean...
     - [Josh] Nothing, man.     
     - She's fucking...         
 - You said she's lying to me.  
 - [Josh]                       
 Nothing, Megan, just shut up.  
 - [Jeff] About what?           
 - [Josh]                       
 Nothing, man, just come back.  
 - [Megan] He's just talking... 
 - [Jeff] No, Josh said...      
      - [Megan] No, no...       
      - Shut...                 
  Josh said, what?              
  You're fucking lying to me.   
[Josh] Everybody just settle    
down, okay, come back over here.
     [Megan] Look, we just      
     need to concentrate        
      on surviving through      
      the night, okay.          
 [Jeff] Josh, you got           
 something to tell me or what?  
  [Josh] No, man,               
  we got nothing to tell you.   
   No, well you just said       
   that Megan's lying to me,    
 what is she lying to me about? 
    - [Megan] Nothing, okay?    
    - [Josh] Nothing...         
   [Jeff]                       
   What, are you guys fucking   
     fooling around behind      
     my back or something?      
  [Megan]                       
  Jeff, just please calm down,  
  okay, now is not the time--   
      - [Jeff] Oh... Oh...      
      - [Josh] Jeff.            
      [Jeff] Now it all         
      fucking makes sense.      
      You fucking serious?      
[Josh] Don't be like that, man. 
     [Megan] Jeff, can you      
     just come back here?       
 [Josh] Jeff, come over here,   
 okay, we'll talk about this.   
   [Jeff] You're supposed       
   to be my fucking brother.    
  [Josh] Jeff, don't be like    
  that, man, just come on.      
    [Jeff] Yeah, and you,       
    don't fucking touch me.     
        [Megan yells]           
     [Jeff] Fuck you guys,      
     you're on your own.        
 - [Megan] What?                
 - [Josh]                       
 Jeff, what are you doing, man? 
  [Jeff] You're on your own,    
  you can fuck off.             
- [Megan]                       
What are you talking about?     
- [Josh] Don't be an idiot, man.
    - Come on.                  
    - [Jeff] I never want       
    to see your face again.     
     - [Megan] No, please.      
     - [Josh] Jeff.             
[Jeff] You deserve each other.  
     [Josh] Jeff, come on,      
     get back here, man.        
      [Jeff] You can both       
      go to fucking hell!       
[Josh] Get back, Jeff, come on. 
       [Megan screaming]        
       [Josh indistinct]        
      [Megan] Oh, my God!       
 - Megan!                       
 - [Megan] Do you see anything? 
  [Josh] Megan,                 
  I don't see nothing. Megan.   
         [Megan gasps]          
     [mumbling indistinct]      
      There's something...      
       [Megan screaming]        
  - Something touched my leg.   
  - [Jeff] Megan!               
   - Are you okay?              
   - [Megan] Help me, please.   
     Help me, Jeff, please.     
           [panting]            
       [Jeff] It's okay,        
       Megan, just relax.       
       Megan, it's okay.        
   - [Megan] Help me!           
   - [Jeff]                     
   No, it's going to be okay.   
  - Just swim to me all right?  
  - [Megan] I can't.            
[Jeff] Just focus on me, okay?  
  [Megan] I don't want to die.  
            Jeff...             
          [splashing]           
         [Jeff] Megan!          
      [muffled screaming]       
         [Jeff] Megan!          
- Megan!                        
- [Josh] I can't see her, Jeff. 
I can't see her.                
     [Jeff] Keep searching,     
     keep looking, Josh.        
     Josh, can you see her?     
[Josh] I can't find her, Jeff.  
I can't find her.               
    [Jeff] You fucking...       
[Josh]                          
Why'd you have to swim off, man.
  Why'd you have to swim off?   
         [Jeff] Megan!          
 [Jeff] Josh, you're a scumbag  
 you know that right?           
  How's your conscience after   
  what happened tonight?        
             Josh.              
     What you're not going      
     to say anything?           
        Josh. Hey, Josh.        
 Hey, look at the camera, man.  
I'm making the video now. Look. 
              Hey.              
     Get off the life vest.     
    I found it, go find your    
    own fucking life vest.      
            Get off.            
Josh. Huh, what are doing still 
hanging around here, buddy?     
       Nobody wants you.        
      Yeah. You know what,      
      if we ever get back,      
       I'm going to put         
       this video online.       
 Everybody's going to see you   
 for the scumbag that you are.  
       How do you feel          
       about that, Josh?        
          Huh, buddy?           
   Yeah. Hey, you know what?    
 You're not my brother anymore. 
 I hope you know that.          
    I'm disgraced with you.     
       And everyone who's       
       going to see this        
 is going to feel the same way. 
        - Knock it off.         
        - [indistinct]          
         Knock it off.          
            Quit it.            
            Stop it.            
       [both indistinct]        
 - How can you say that, man?   
 - I told you...                
        How do you think        
        I fucking feel?         
     [Jeff] And I was going     
     to marry Megan.            
      [Josh] What do you        
      think we were doing?      
    [Jeff] And what'd you       
    go ahead and do, huh?       
    What do you think...?       
       I loved her, too.        
      - What?                   
      - I loved her, too.       
    - Don't... say that.        
    - I wanted to tell you.     
   - I wanted to talk to you.   
   - You wanted to tell me?     
I wanted to tell you, all right.
[Jeff] You didn't have to       
tell me shit. You just...       
          I wanted to.          
         Knock it off!          
           [grunting]           
         Jeff, stop it.         
        Jeff, Jeff are you okay?
               Is it your heart?
I told you to settle down, man. 
I told you to settle down.      
    It's going to be okay...    
             Jeff.              
 Hey, hey, stay with me, man.   
  Just hang in there, buddy.    
  Helps going to come.          
  They're going to bring your   
  medicine and we're going to   
  get out of here.              
        Both of us, man.        
      Just hang in there,       
      just hang in there.       
      Hang in there, man,       
      hang in there.            
       Somebody help me!        
            Help me!            
            [coughs]            
         [Josh crying]          
       I don't want to...       
       I've gotta let go.       
            [crying]            
             Jeff.              
        I'm sorry, Jeff.        
           [whimpers]           
           I'm sorry.           
I don't have much battery left. 
    And I don't think I'm       
    going to make it alive.     
 So, just, if anyone finds this 
   please tell my mom           
   and dad that I love them.    
    I love you                  
    and I miss you so much.     
     I didn't mean for any      
     of this to happen.         
   Jeff, if I could,            
   I'd take it all back, man.   
     I never would have         
     over stepped the line      
      with you and Megan.       
   You mean the world to me.    
         You mean...            
 But I know that can't happen.  
       I watched you die.       
       Now, it's my turn.       
           Hey! Hey!            
     [helicopter overhead]      
              Hey!              
      [muffled screaming]       
              Hey!              
            [yells]             
      You know, they put        
      everything on that.       
     It's quite brutal          
     how it all went down.      
       And we saw them...       
  ...try to hold on to hope.    
  [Jeff]                        
  Will you take a photo of us?  
       How are we doing?        
     - Good, yeah.              
     - I know I look good.
