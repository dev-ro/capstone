Writers basically
take readers hostage.
You're forcing someone to spend
five, six, seven, eight hours in
your brain.
{\an8}People have less time now.
{\an8}10 years ago,
you had a minor bestseller.
{\an8}Now people are saturated
with information.
{\an8}They have every
excuse not to read.
{\an8}The fact is, writers have
less legitimacy now
{\an8}than ever before.
{\an8}Not to discourage you,
{\an8}but 10 years ago
was the wrong time
{\an8}to leave and become a shrink.
{\an8}I felt so bad,
it was like a suicide.
{\an8}A deliberate waste of talent.
{\an8}I felt that I cut myself off
emotionally.
{\an8}Right.
{\an8}- Sorry to be so frank.
- No, go ahead.
{\an8}But you need to know the score.
{\an8}You say writing
is your priority again.
{\an8}Fantastic.
{\an8}But we both know
inspiration is a lie
{\an8}and hard work is pointless.
{\an8}People write like crazy
{\an8}and end up with nothing.
{\an8}They think they have an idea,
{\an8}but fiction is not a subject.
{\an8}Fiction is about elements
{\an8}triggering a process.
{\an8}Or it can be a pre-
existing process,
{\an8}like a news item.
{\an8}That can work.
{\an8}Julien Dars wrote
about an American
who killed her
roommate in Italy,
caught between
two justice systems.
A crazy case, beauty on trial...
Adèle Simonie
has a book coming out
about the text
message murder case.
This girl texted
a suicidal friend
until he killed himself.
Talk about great chick lit!
Thanks for your advice, Basile.
Listen, I'm here to help you.
I'm glad you're back.
- Send me your stuff.
- Perfect.
Boris, what I have
to say isn't easy.
For personal reasons,
I must put an end
to our work together.
I'm so sorry.
It has nothing to do with you.
I have no choice.
I have highly
competent colleagues
who can meet you.
They know.
I can call them for you.
You don't give a damn.
Think I come
here for your competency?
I'll help you make
a smooth transition.
Isn't it terrifying enough
to have lived this life?
And on top of it,
to have to tell it
all to a stranger?
Look at it another way.
You won't repeat your actions.
You're fucking with me!
You're stealing my work!
Seven years of my life!
You're taking them away.
I'm gonna drop dead!
Electricity's down.
That game was getting old.
Got a present for you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I've got news.
I'm writing again.
I left most of my patients.
Why'd you do that?
So I can focus
wholly on my novel.
It's the only way.
I think it's great.
OK.
But how will your patients feel?
What if a surgeon left an
operation?
"Bye, I'm off to write."
A bit of guilt never hurts.
Just a bit.
Hello?
- Hello.
- Yes?
Your colleague at the hospital
gave me your number.
Sorry, I know it's late,
but I'm hurting so bad!
Everything's wrong.
I need to see someone.
I'm sorry,
I'm no longer taking patients.
I didn't inform
the hospital yet.
Sorry, but maybe
you could call them back.
They have highly
competent therapists.
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to bother you.
- No worries.
- I don't want therapy.
I just need to make a decision.
I understand...
but you should tell someone
who can follow up with you.
OK?
I hope it works out.
I'm so sorry, once again.
Goodbye, good luck.
Billionaire Robert Durst
Accidentally Admits
his Crimes on Television
Here are two colleagues
you can call.
I can give you
other names if need be.
I'm two months pregnant,
but can't keep it.
I'm so scared! I can't tell him.
What will I do about work?
Everything I've built
will come crashing down.
I'm so tired of lying!
In my dreams,
people unmask me.
I'm afraid to sleep.
Who's the father?
An actor.
He's an actor.
He's famous, I can't tell you.
How many did you quit?
Twenty-seven.
I still have five.
I feel like
I'm weaning off my patients.
I kept a few.
I'm working towards abstinence.
- Are you tempted to drink?
- Not at all.
I'm in a very positive place.
I'm mainly obsessed with
writing.
It's intoxicating too, but words
are the drug. It's safe.
I don't want to be my mother.
Weigh my child down
with my failures.
Blame him for my disillusions.
I never want him to think
he prevented me from thriving.
I'd rather he suffer my
selfishness than my sacrifice.
If you abort,
he won't suffer at all.
You seem to have decided.
I'm not strong
enough to keep it.
I have to work.
If I lose this job,
I lose everything.
I'm not judging you.
But when you called me,
you said you had
to make a decision.
Is making the decision alone
the hard part?
You don't understand.
He got me the part.
I owe him so much.
Why didn't you tell him?
What're you afraid of?
He's crazy about me.
He wants children with me.
He's extremely sensitive.
He couldn't handle it.
And you feel he might jeopardize
your role in the film?
I didn't mention
he's with someone.
The director of the film.
You quit patients to write,
then take this girl?
She was in a critical state.
It was complicated
to reject her.
You don't reject, you guide.
I chose to guide
her to my office.
So it was your choice.
We all have a weakness
for some of them, right?
Sure, but you have
a weakness for writing.
Are they mutually exclusive?
My job is to say yes.
Are you in love?
I don't know.
Want to talk about the sex?
I didn't think...
I would.
No subject is off limits.
There was this one time...
Sorry, I don't think I can.
If you started,
it may be important.
We were sleeping.
I woke up and saw
him looking at me.
I sensed his desire.
We didn't speak.
It was like he'd waited for me.
I started touching myself.
He did too.
He tried to come close, but I
motioned for him to stay away.
I tried to temper my excitement
by staring at the door.
But his gaze,
the very idea that he'd been
gazing at me like that,
was so powerful,
I came before he did.
I moved close to kiss him.
The intensity was insane.
We hadn't even touched yet.
When I kissed him,
I tasted tears.
He'd experienced my pleasure
just by watching me.
It had flowed into him.
Something like that.
I think he cried
because he really saw me.
Me.
It was beyond sex.
Is it your turn or mine?
- Yours.
- Sorry.
- Buying?
- No.
Why not?
You'd have all four.
I don't understand your mind.
You'll lose.
I don't love you.
I'm not into you.
Our friendship means fuck all.
I'm playing alone.
I'm beating you bad.
My turn to ask the questions.
OK, go ahead.
What's your favorite place?
- In Paris, or anywhere?
- Anywhere.
Right here.
My office.
Because it's my very own space.
I know what you want.
What do I want?
For me to tell you mine.
See you next week?
Mine is...
my grandmother's laundry room.

your arms around me ♪

hard to bear ♪

Oops, mistake!
And something.
♪ You all know ♪

Please, I must see
you tomorrow. 6 pm?
See you tomorrow, 5:30 pm.
Erase message.
Tomorrow morning, 6:30.
I'm not gonna let
you pick the time.
You're making me
handle her alone.
I can't watch someone
destroy herself.
Then do something!
She's not someone,
she's your mother!
- Not now, guys.
- Can't you see this is private?
Keep your ass out of it!
So you're avoiding drinkers now?
You're so imperious.
Your boyfriend's influence?
I'm trying to quit,
as it happens.
Gabriel has helped me more
than any of you ever did.
He believes in me.
He alone believes
I can be a writer.
He saves me from you.
From this family who...
You need to be saved from me?
Do you hear what you're saying?
We can't communicate.
You're in some kind of denial...
And you're in a
fucking ivory tower.
Just stay there, nice and warm.
Don't come out or
you'll get dizzy.
You're blind, look at you.
A slave to her selfishness.
Fine. Go sing
your crappy little songs.
Have a great new year.
Meanwhile, I'll just...
disappear from your
life. For real.
How do you feel?
Hot.
Do you still associate Gabriel
with alcohol?
Sometimes I know exactly
what you'll say.
You brought it up!
What's it been?
Eight or nine years?
Gabriel is a ghost.
What is he? He's gone.
He's active but harmless.
You decide whether
to keep him at bay.
Seen your actress?
Yes.
Anything to tell me?
No.
Go on, I'm listening.
I did it. I told him.
Tell me exactly what happened.
He was wild with joy.
Look at the bigger picture.
What's happening is a sign.
Don't be afraid.
You bet I'm afraid, Igor.
How can I hide it?
At first it won't show.
We'll be on an island!
Sorry to interrupt.
Mika's on her way.
Thanks.
You can do the film
and have the baby.
I don't want to keep it.
- I won't let you do that.
- Meaning?
- She wants you on set now.
- OK.
Things will get violent.
Afterwards...
he apologized.
He realized how
brutal he'd been.
I understand
you don't want a baby now.
It hurts me to say it, but...
I know I can't force you.
We have plenty of
time for babies.
Unless you never want one.
That's fine too.
Mika came to us.
She wanted to rehearse a scene.
We couldn't do it.
I looked at Igor
and felt a rage rising up in me.
I couldn't believe
he was using his power...
so brutally, so shamelessly.
I wanted to kill him
for the emotional blackmail.
That non-existent child
suddenly changed everything.
Our bond was no longer about
desire.
Or rather, desire had taken on
a tangible form.
It was no longer fantasy.
"Take this child from me
and you'll lose your job,
I'll destroy your life.
You cannot win this."
What's going on?
I had a nightmare.
I saw Mom.
Her body in the car.
It was horrible.
You and I were carrying her body
by the side of the
road for hours.
I couldn't figure out
what I was seeing.
Her jaw was gone
and her tongue
was sticking out of her neck!
Calm down.
Calm down. It's over now.
It's over now.
You'll be alright.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
I think I need a drink.
Go ahead, I don't want
to know where it is.
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.
Everything I hate in myself
comes from her.
I don't want to be her!
You're not your mother!
You're nothing like her!
You embrace life,
you move forward.
You'll never end up like her.
- It was an accident.
- No, suicide!
It was raining.
It's tragic, but it happens.
She was dead drunk.
It was no accident.
I don't think I should
be staying with you guys.
I'm in your way.
In our way?
You're never in our way.
You're never in our way.
The kids love you.
I know, I love them too.
It's just that...
I feel like
you've managed to build a life.
I'm alone.
I work odd jobs, I'm 36
and still doing my thesis.
Don't be silly.
Seriously, I think
I'm in the process
of becoming a loser.
Nonsense.
You're the freest person I know.
You're never complacent.
You'll be OK, don't
doubt yourself.
I miss Mom so much!
Don't you?
No.
How do you hold it
together so well?
I fake it.
Has the abortion
been scheduled?
Yes.
We're going for an
ultrasound first.
I believed it all.
But two hours later,
I began to wonder.
I'm not sure
what he told me is true.
I never told you.
Before Mika, there was
a woman who got pregnant.
When she gave birth,
the child was dead. Still born.
His tears were like in a film I
love where he plays a widower.
At the time,
I absolutely believed
he was sincere.
Only when I was alone
did I begin to doubt.
But I'd already given him hope.
When is the abortion?
It was yesterday.
But I got it
postponed three days.
Then I'll fly to the island
for the shoot.
What do you want?
I think I need your help.
I can't think,
I can't trust my decisions.
- I'm trying to help you.
- No.
You have to see him.
Come to the shoot.
I can't think anymore.
No, impossible.
I can't do that
and it wouldn't help.
We're on Stromboli in four days.
I'm nearly three months along.
I'm terrified.
I can't do it.
A young woman...
actress...
just starting out...
first film...
Characters...
Margot, Gabriel...
No, no, no, no. Selma,
you know that's off limits.
I just read the writing.
Nothing's written. It's my work.
- Edith, please.
- Come here.
You need to learn
to manipulate your mom.
It'll come in handy later, too.
Tell her you feel
she doesn't love you.
Or less than your sister.
Or say you feel
she's disappointed in you.
Or that at school,
someone you like hates you.
Make her pity you.
You've got two things
going on with her.
She's your mom,
and she's a shrink.
Moms hate to see
their children suffer.
But for shrinks, it's a crime!
Get it? Go see her.
Act really unhappy,
and say, "Mom,
I'm afraid I lack the tools
to make it in life."
Sad puppy eyes. Cosette.
Go on.
That's it. Lay it on thicker.
Perfect. Go get her.
- Mom...
- Yes?
I'm afraid I lack the tools
to make it in life.
Honey!
What're you talking about?
You're far too young
to worry about that.
Why do you say such things?
You bet you have the tools.
She's got strange
worries for her age.
Remember how she looked
at you in the maternity ward?
You know, I'd never
imagined my child would...
judge me or even look at me.
I felt her eyes asking me,
"Who are you?"
You have to have fun,
play with the
monster inside you.
I don't believe in the
whole method acting thing,
digging deep down
almost religiously.
I believe in lies.
Making things up.
Deep down inside, I'm often
empty. Totally empty.
I gotta make it happen somehow.
That's what they pay me for.
Mika is...
a woman I truly admire.
I have deep admiration
and respect for her.
I'd even say she's the first
woman I've loved this way.
Liar.
See, that's something
I really don't like about him.
He's lying all the time... you
never know when he is straight.
Absolutely private, you know.
You must imagine...
I... I didn't know for four year
that he is playing the piano.
He is so private that
he didn't even tell me.
So, one day I come
home and there was
this beautiful music
and I thought
he put a record on maybe
there're something or whatever,
and then I saw him on the piano
and he was actually
playing the piano.
Perfectly well. I was shocked!
Because it's not something
that you hide from somebody,
it's not something stupid
that you do.
So there's really
no reason to just not say it.
So I get really angry
and he gets really angry,
we get really angry each other,
walk out of the room...
Just to meet him once.
No way, there's no reason.
She's testing you. Say no.
Your role is to
stay in the fantasy.
But you want to?
No, but... I need to know
who I'm dealing with.
Who Margot's dealing with.
Not you or your character.
Want to talk about Gabriel?
I'm so happy your book is out.
What can I do for you?
Get out of my life.
You take up too much space.
You're too alive.
You're cutting me in half.
I'm starting to
resent helping you.
You found your place.
I probably helped.
It's all good,
I'm happy for you.
Almost happier
than I would be for myself.
You're leaving
because you helped me?
You took on the
role of helping me
because your pride
wanted to save me.
But I never saw you that way.
Deep down, maybe
you preferred me
when I was down.
You can't handle me up?
In life, we change, we evolve.
Nothing's clean or set in stone!
It's crazy to reject that!
You're pathetic
if you don't accept that.
I'll be a shit for you.
Prefer me weak?
I'll be a shit.
Must see you. Aborting at 11
tomorrow, then off to island...
Missed call
Hate to bother you,
need session urgently...
Can you please call me?
I'm going crazy...
Must see you. Aborting
at 11 tomorrow,
then off to island... I'm lost.
You're cruel to abandon me...
Your silence is killing me.
Please, we must talk before 11
Failure to assist
{\an8}I NEED YOU!
I'M GONNA DO IT
Call Margot Vasilis.
Margot Vasilis.
Leave me a message.
Your grandmother's laundry room.
Why is it your favorite room?
Because it locks.
Why do you need to lock it?
One question only, Doctor.
That's the rule.
Hang on a sec.
Why no answers?
Did you get my messages?
Margot, I didn't call because
it was your choice
to make, alone.
Think I made the right choice?
Yes, I think you did.
I didn't do it, I didn't go.
I didn't get the abortion.
I needed to hear that yesterday.
What was the right choice?
Who's Margot?
None of your business.
Some people are unhappy
their whole lives.
They can't shake it.
They take tons of stuff
to forget they're alive.
What stuff?
Alcohol, pills...
Or both. Helps them feel better.
But not entirely.
And then,
when they have the energy,
they use it
to ruin other people's lives.
I'm very worried. Period.
Even if you don't
want to talk to me,
tell me how you're
doing. Period.
Send to Margot Vasilis.
What do you do in your
grandmother's laundry room?
I listen to a song.
Give me the dice.
From now on,
the rules have changed.
Two questions per lost roll.
What song?
Fuck off.
God,
grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,
the courage to change
the things I can,
and the wisdom to
know the difference.
That girl's driving me insane.
I hate her.
Are you in love?
What?
Are you sure?
What're you doing?
We can't do that anymore.
That's it.
I did it.
What did you do?
I did what you told me to do.
What'd I tell you to do?
I did it, I got the abortion.
I never told you to...
The hospital was disgusting,
it took hours!
Then I told Igor.
He went nuts.
Hang on.
Come back to Paris
if you need to.
I can't, I'm contractually
obliged to stay.
I'm stuck here.
Explain it to me.
What happened with Igor?
He told Mika everything.
The challenge now is to...
finish the film in an atmosphere
relative to harmony.
You know, uh...
As you can probably imagine,
I would like to fire
you both right now,
but as you can also imagine,
it's impossible, so...
Yeah. Just to let you know,
there's no chance in hell
that I let you two ruin my film.
Of course...
They need you at the wardrobe.
Because Karin and Mario
are having in issue
- and it's not looking good.
- Ten minutes.
Twenty minutes.
She has no sense of priorities
So...
on her fucking film!
As I was saying, you know,
heh...
sometimes, having
a breakdown is a luxury. Yeah?
I don't have it right now, so...
I admire you.
I mean, I didn't expect such...
such a good reaction.
You were, uh,
expecting something?
No. No, no. No, no, it's the way
I choose my words...
OK. Can I make a quick request?
'Cause we are running out
of time and da-da-da.
Can you go see Igor?
Can you please make this right?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
Oh, you know, uh, no.
It's an order,
not a request. Thank you.
Mika, Mika, I really
want to tell you
acting is everything I have and
it's a luck to be in your movie.
I would do anything
for your movie, I swear!
Margot! The more you thank me,
the more I hate you!
And if we weren't seven weeks
into the shoot,
I would destroy you.
So go to make up, please,
we're shooting in 20 minutes,
and don't forget to put
some cream on your skin.
We're on a boat!
This is not good.
Ask the producers to let you
fly to Paris Saturday.
We must see each other.
We'll go to a doctor
to make sure you're OK.
You need to be examined.
You're not alone.
Do you hear me?
I'll see you when you arrive.
OK?
Thanks for helping me.
You helped me in your own way.
I believed for years,
but I don't anymore.
Believed what?
That I could overcome
my background.
But I've failed.
I'm filthy. I'm filthy!
There's something filthy in me.
It'll never come out.
You can't build
on a foundation of shit.
Everything is built on shit.
- Stop writing about her.
- I'm not.
She's just one
of many influences.
It's a confluence.
You're out of line,
transgressing
every rule of our profession.
Recording her sessions,
meddling in her life...
- No...
- You are!
I've been seeing you six years.
You've crossed a line.
Stop analyzing her.
You can't even analyze yourself.
OK, let's analyze me.
I'm obsessed with her.
I advised her to abort...
You never advised her to abort.
She made you think you were
important so you'd give her
more.
You fell for it
and went right off the rails.
In your head, at your computer,
alone. Not in her life.
I'm afraid she'll kill herself.
Live with that fear.
That's your job.
I can't be cold as ice.
It wouldn't be your fault.
What'd you say?
Are you implying
I'm cold as ice?
No, I think you do
exactly as you should.
Can I get some Celexa?
Sure.
- How long?
- Two months.
What did you feel
when you learned
she'd aborted?
You're forcing me
to be an asshole
because I will not raise
that child!
You don't have to.
You're forcing me to abandon a
child and consider myself an
asshole!
I understand your position.
I won't change my mind.
We're separated.
Make me suffer if you like,
but not an innocent child.
Do you miss him?
I don't let myself go there.
Try to go there.
I do miss the intensity
and the love we had, yes.
Selma is so much like him.
It hurts sometimes.
Margot?
No, hello. Sorry, it's Igor.
Igor Maleski.
She asked me to call.
Why doesn't she call?
I just found her.
She'd gone missing for two days.
She took a bunch
of pills and vomited.
She's better now, but...
she's asking for you.
Says she can't do
it without you.
It's gotten very complicated.
We can't shoot.
The film's on hold.
I know it's a bit strange,
but she only wants
to talk to you.
It made me crazy.
We were close again.
I loved her so much.
It feels like a betrayal.
Sorry.
I'm not angling for pity.
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.
Don't be against
me on principle.
Communicate with me.
I know it's delicate.
She says a lot of things
I can't control.
The subjectivity of her words
must seem objective to you.
I'm not against you.
You have been through a lot,
okay?
So I gave you corticoids
and the voice will come back.
But first of all,
you need to sleep.
Promise?
I'm being manipulated,
I know it!
It's not paranoia.
These people are twisted enough
to make sure you fail,
to ruin your career.
You need to calm
down, for a start.
I'm here to help you.
But I need to know
what you expect from me.
I don't want him
speaking to me on set.
He has to go through you.
OK.
Thanks for coming.
It'll be OK.
It'll be OK.
Cut!
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,
please go back
to the first position, please.
Can you make it look like
you're really playing?
Try at least. Thank you.
We start again! Take it
from the top, please!
Positions! Quiet! Rolling!
Stop. I can't work like this.
I can't do it.
She's giving nothing.
You're totally empty!
Igor. Don't ever interrupt a
take, OK?
And Margot, please, we need
a little more depth and complexity:
you're tempted, charmed, amused
but weary and then you crack!
He makes you laugh,
so we go again.
Uh, close up on Margot.
- Yes.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Do you think Sibyl
could do it instead of Igor?
She can play Igor and I
prefer...
No, impossible.
He's not in the shot, right?
No! Uh, no, it's impossible.
Please, let's go. I will not
cater to your every whim.
It's OK, I leave.
Igor, please!
Give me the mic.
Let's get back to it.
Uh, listen, I never did acting.
Uh, I didn't expect to...
- Can you sing?
- No. Kind of.
OK. Give her the lines please.
Sibyl, I know you came
here to help us
and here's your chance, yeah?
Okay?
Uh, just do your best.
And relax, you're off camera.
Ready. Quiet. Rolling.
Thank you very much.
Ready?
Ready?
Sibyl, it's Basile.
I read what you
sent, it's great.
War of the sexes on a backdrop
of social revenge, love it.
Love the alternating
female narrators too.
When we learn
she may have made
it up, the actress is
terrifying.
The other woman is even crazier.
I'm totally hooked.
Sibyl, excuse me.
I just wanted to say...
I can't do it without you.
Thanks.
Yes?
Can we talk?
Sure, of course.
I need a drink.
- May I?
- Sure, go ahead.
You know, she's out of her mind.
You need to bring
her back to reality.
Yes, I know but...
That's what I'm trying
to do, really, but...
I also need to help her
to give what you want.
For that, she has to trust me.
You understand?
Of course I understand!
I'm a human too. You know?
Yes.
But she keeps pushing me...
you see that, right?
And if she keeps pushing me
all the time, I will snap.
And if I snap,
I will lose everything!
I will lose my boyfriend,
I will lose the film!
It's a very complex
situation for you.
You know, I cast Margot because
Igor was pushing up her talents.
You know?
He insisted I would audition her,
and in the beginning, I thought,
"OK, it's a bit strange,"
but then when I saw her,
I mean, I immediately
understood what was going on.
And why did you cast her if you
knew that she was with Igor?
I figured, it was just a...
"petite histoire," you know?
And I thought that not casting
her would make the feelings
even stronger, whereas,
if they would see each other
every day on set, you know?
I would just have to sit back
and watch reality destroy
things.
I never thought that
she would get pregnant.
There was a time when I really
wanted to have a child with
Igor.
And, uh, it became clear that
he didn't want one with me.
And, um...
it took me some time, but I... I
learned to accept that.
It's OK, but...
you know, having one
with someone else now
is really a completely
different story.
OK, you promise me you will
not talk about this with anyone?
- I can count on you?
- Yes, you can count on me, yes.
And you keep me
informed about them.
What they do?
I need you on my side, really.
I'm on your side. Okay?
Thank you very much.
- Shape up.
- Don't touch me.
Cut! Thanks.
Let's do another one,
we're not quite there yet.
Don't touch me!
- Shape up.
- Don't touch me.
It hurts when you use your
open palm. Control yourself.
Don't talk to me. Talk to Sibyl.
Sibyl, tell her to quit
hurting me on purpose.
More.
Sybil...
Sybil...
Uh, tell her that she has to be
a more convincing drunk.
- So far I don't buy it.
- Okay.
Mika wants you to be drunker,
like you'd had a few more.
Thanks.
- Be drunk, be angry, slap softly...
- OK.
OK.
For once,
can't we try to create emotion
without resorting
to simplistic impulses?
OK, guys, keep the drama
fictional,
if you don't mind.
Thank you.
Ready?
Action!
- Shape up.
- Don't touch me.
That was perfect! Thank
you!
That was perfect! Thank you!
Jaque!
Jaque!
Sibyl! Was I good?
Okay! Let's go!
Another one!
Ready. Quiet.
Rolling.
Do you enjoy hurting me?
Do you enjoy hitting
me like that?
Humiliating me?
Humiliating me...
I can't do this anymore.
Can't we try to
create emotion...
Create emotion...
fabricate emotion...
without resorting to
simplistic instincts, impulses?
Simplistic impulses...
That's exactly what
I'm trying to do.
How was I?
Tell me.
Really?
Sibyl...
I just wanted to say,
I can't do it without you.
Thank you.
I don't trust anyone on set.
I'm being manipulated.
I'm going crazy.
Was I good, really?
No one can talk to me on set.
They have to go through you.
Understand?
Thank you.
Thank you, Sibyl.
I'm hurting so bad.
I feel filthy.
Filthy!
Sybil!
Sybil...
- Hi.
- Yes?
Hi?
I'm the Italian co-producer.
- Ah, nice to meet you!
- Let me get you a drink.
Oh. No, no, thank you. No.
I understand you made
a great deal for the film.
Oh.
I... I do my best.
- That's your cigarettes?
- Yes.
May I? Thank you.
Between you and me, they're a
little sick in the head.
It reassuring for me to have
a level-headed person
like you on the set.
Let me give you my number.
Feel free to give me a call
if you need anything, eh?
- Okay.
- I'll check in from time to time
to see if everything's
going smoothly.
OK.
Thank you.
OK.
- You want?
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Sure?
- Sure, sure, sure.
- All good?
- Yeah, you?
I'm good.
- Gin tonic?
- No thanks.
- No?
- No.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I needed to clear my head.
I'm going for a walk.
Care to join me?
Okay, let's do it again.
Quiet. Rolling.
Uh, Margot!
I want you drowning in tears.
OK? He betrayed you.
You're not just upset. OK?
You are devastated. Action.
Stop! Igor, we really
have to see the...
We have to feel the love
and the desire in your eyes.
Otherwise we will think
you really did betray her
and the film is fucked,
you know.
Okay, but the camera
is behind me.
Yeah, I know,
I put it there, yeah.
But do you want to have
the discussion now
about what I see, what I don't
see,
when you turn your back towards
me?
- I don't think we have time.
- Time.
Positions.
Quiet, please. Rolling.
Sixty-seven, four, four.
And Margot, now is the
moment
you can do everything you want
to get in this state
that you have to be in.
You can scream at the sea,
everything that's inside
that has to be coming out,
and you can yell at me,
whatever.
One more.
Action.
Margot. Kiss him. Kiss him!
Stop! Igor...
What the hell are you doing?!
What is it?
Do you have a problem with your
nose in the way or what is it?
I can not read it!
It was beautiful,
it was perfect, right?
It was perfect and then
you started kissing her
and something was going on
inside your head, I have no idea.
I don't know what it is,
but it looked like you were
kissing your sister.
Yeah, I'm sorry. We are mounting
to watch the climax here.
It's desire taking over,
animal instinct,
all the stuff that I wrote
in the fucking script!
So, do you really want me
to tell you how to desire her?
OK. Margot.
Your feelings are contradictory.
It's a...
He disgusts you
from the moral standpoint,
but at same time, you're
attracted to him deep down.
Can you please give them
something
that will make them work?
I don't know, do you have
any pills,
Valium, something,
please?
- Help me.
- Yeah, I will find something.
- OK.
- Yes.
Mika?
We can't waste so much time
with this scene any longer.
You know, the weather is
changing.
Yeah, I know.
And you have to settle down.
I know, I know! You're my only
friend.
I'm sick of that German bitch.
She just said it was great.
- It's her approach.
- Let's go!
Great!
Time!
Positions! Quiet!
Rolling.
Sixty-seven, four, twenty-two.
- Set.
- Action.
No, Igor, I'm sorry. It's...
No, don't look at me.
Please stay in the situation.
It's, it's not Dirty Dancing,
you know. It's a bit less...
OK.
More intensity, please.
Yes. The hands, very good.
Now lay her on the ground,
please.
Good.
Now stop kissing.
Look at each other
in a long gaze and then
you start kissing again,
even more passionately
this time, please.
I'm sorry.
What? What, what,
what, what, what is it?
I'm sorry.
No, I don't think you're sorry.
I'm... No! I'm not going
to take this anymore!
It's not a joke!
We're not making a comedy!
I don't know what's
wrong with you!
- I'm sorry.
- I don't understand!
We don't have time!
I shut off. I'm done. I'm done.
No, no, Mika, we're almost
there.
I'm done! It's over!
She'll get her act together, OK?
Mika, please!
No, I want you to take me back
to the shore right now
- or I will jump and swim back.
- No, Mika, calm down...
Calm down, OK? We'll start
again, it's gonna be alright.
Mika, please!
What are you doing?
Mika! Mika!
Come on,
we have no time for this!
Finish the film without me.
They can't stand me anymore
and the feeling is mutual.
Maybe Sibyl could direct us?
OK, let's do that.
Ready. We'll fix it in editing.
Positions.
Let's start with you lying down.
Let's start.
Talk us through it, it helps.
Margot, surrender.
But you're not passive.
Look at him.
Caress her.
How was the water?
I'm sorry.
I think you'll be happy.
They were great.
- Yeah?
- Come take a look.
Ready?
What's that sound?
I'm not OK...
What's going on?
Hmm?
I'm hurting so bad, Edith!
- Andrea, what is it?
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?
I never should've come here.
I'm an imposter.
I'm an imposter.
Where are you?
You need to calm down.
No, you don't understand.
I've gone off the rails.
I'm not in any reality.
I slept with the actor.
Everything I do,
everything I do...
is nothing.
Galotin will drive you
to the airport. Right?
Sure.
I'm pretty sure that...
everything you're about to say
will not surprise me so much.
So, sometimes it's better
to say nothing and just go.
No, I beg you, not that!
Madam, hello. I have white wine,
red wine and champagne.
Also soft drinks
and fruit juice.
What's your pleasure?
Champagne.
Thanks.
- Hi, guys!
- Mommy!
Mommy!
All that is for you.
Chocolates!
Girls...
Go to your room, please.
Make it snappy!
Go to your room, girls!
Why that song?
It's the last song my mom
and I heard before she died.
I listen to it in
the laundry room.
I need to be alone.
I need to be sure
no one will bother me.
I remember her smell.
Her perfume.
You know, Daniel,
you're allowed to be sad.
You're allowed to cry.
Does this mean
I don't need to come anymore?
I don't know.
Are you sick of coming?
No.
See you next week?
See you next week.
{\an8}10 months later
It's absolutely wonderful.
The style just flows.
You really capture
the urban anxiety.
It's so skillfully rendered.
I found it truly powerful.
- Bravo.
- Nice, thanks.
I didn't analyze every line,
I devoured it.
It awakened things in me,
brought up strong feelings.
What about the lifeguard?
You know, the one who...
Probably my favorite character.
He touched me deeply. I love
your subtle treatment of him.
There's no lifeguard, honey.
And a candy apple, please.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Ten Euros please,
young man.
Thank you.
- Let go?
- Yes.
- Who's she?
- She's...
an old friend.
Wow.
- Yeah...
- You guys are so cute.
What're you doing here?
I'm with friends.
Run along, be right there.
Don't you live down south?
I came back a month ago.
Right, I see.
- How've you been?
- Good.
- Still writing?
- Yes.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
So are you... living in Paris?
I'm looking
for an affordable apartment.
I know a good website.
I'll send you the link.
It's cheaper than agencies.
Sounds good.
OK. So you work in Paris?
Yep, still teaching lit.
Got a job in Nanterre.
- I miss Paris.
- Right.
Is she here?
I'll be going now.
Have a nice day.
I loved working with you.
The whole experience
felt like a dream.
That's what we try to do.
Making a film
is like making a dream.
I hope you will all
dream along with us.
For me, it was more
of a nightmare.
I mean, who shoots a film
on an active volcano?
Well, I hate that guy.
That's how Mika shows affection.
No, no. Because I hate you too.
What can I say?
Let the screening begin.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- Hello.
- Hello.
The film's great.
Very beautiful.
I mean...
Thanks.
I just wanted to say,
I think your acting is...
I think you...
I think your talent...
No. I mean, your talent...
That's all.
Nasdrovia!
Oops.
- Hello!
- Hi.
- How're you?
- Good, you?
- All good?
- You bet.
Super.
I think love stories, I mean,
it's the first stories
that you think of when you...
when you...
A friend of yours, or...?
Uh, yeah. She helped us with the
movie in Stromboli. She's a...
Why did you choose
Stromboli for the,
for your movie? It's a place
you wanted to shoot or...?
Oh, because it's really far
away.
Sometimes it's good to, to go
away.
Okay.
Hello.
She didn't feel well,
so I brought her home.
Did you read my book?
No, I will later.
Life has no meaning, does it?
She's been gone five days.
Sorry, but you're not coming in.
Not in the state you're in.
The kids won't understand.
You know that.
I love them more than anything.
They deserve better
than a drunk.
I bought your book.
Some things may...
make you feel...
Some characters may resonate
or seem familiar.
I don't mind.
In a way, I'm flattered.
Hello, my name is Sibyl.
I've been sober three weeks.
I no longer think of Margot.
Or Gabriel.
I've started a new novel.
I've stepped back
from those around me.
I see them as characters.
Etienne has no access to me.
No doubt fueling the suspense.
I feel nothing
concrete with him.
But I like what he represents.
I see very clearly now.
And I understand.
My life is a fiction.
I can rewrite it however I like.
I can do anything,
change anything,
create anything.
I'm at the heart
of every choice.
Gabriel is dead to me now.
Who was my father?
What makes you ask?
Why don't I see him?
I told you.
He left before you were born.
Then why did you guys make me?
We loved each other very much.
That makes no sense.
Why'd he leave?
Was he unhappy when I came?
No, he was very happy.
He loved you
even before you were born.
But...
he had things to do elsewhere.
Never doubt his love.
Do I look like him?
Yes.
Do you think of him
when you see me?
Yes.
It's as though
part of him lives inside you.
Do you like it?
