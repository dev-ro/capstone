- Contract 7510 for
three names, Dr. Marinus.
- One of us must have
problems with our memory.
I remember only two names were agreed.
- He's your third.
- I'm, I'm sorry, my friend.
We've both made a mistake.
- He was on the last three missions.
He remembers the last one
and he remembers you as well.
- How come Yuri's in London?
He's Russian.
He lives in Russia.
And if we have a situation,
then our Russian team
will have to handle it.
So why the fuck did you bring him here?
- He's a big name, he's also black.
A black guy in a Russian town
would attract too much attention.
So we put him on the list.
Is he still in training?
- Used up on the way here. He's sleeping.
- Oh, amateurs.
What if he wakes up?
here with us?
- After you keep them
awake all the time, Mr. Ma-
- Dr. Marinus.
By creating exciting situations.
We call it training situations.
They don't make any sense but
it keeps the senses alive.
Allows them to feel the water.
Hear the sound of the street.
Or even just the smoke of a cigarette.
And then the brain does the rest.
How quickly do you need it?
Oh, I don't even have to heroes.
I have one I'm seeing later.
His mind is weak but stable.
I had one but I don't
have an option right here.
- Our colleagues in the East have someone.
They'll send them to
the facility directly.
- Without my first interview and approval?
- Urgent situations need urgent solutions.
- Ah, send Yuri to the facility.
Peacefully.
Quietly.
Use your time and watch me working.
And then maybe you can take some knowledge
And next time
don't bring any surprises.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
Are you-
- My name
is Dr. Daniel Marinus.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cooper.
- Nice to meet you
- Please.
Uh, I, I have your DNA
test results here with-
- Yeah, about that
Why did the laboratory share
that information with you?
And why do you have those before I do?
- All the data is the
property of the company.
They can share it with whomever they want.
You should read what
you sign more carefully.
- Thanks for the advice.
Can I have my results?
- I have a couple
of questions first.
The information that you provided us with
to start the research is less than ideal.
- And why is that a concern?
- Mm, it's peculiar in this day and age
not to have more information
about your background.
- I thought the point of this service
is to discover your background.
- Um, you...
You're a postman, right?
What'd your mother do?
- Why does that matter?
- I don't have time
to explain my research to you, Mr. Cooper.
Everything would go so much
easier if you were to cooperate.
- I don't have to be here, you know.
- You do if you want to see your results.
- I'm sure a lawyer would disagree.
- I'm sure I can afford a better lawyer.
- My mother worked too many
jobs for me to keep track.
She's a single mother and all that.
- Ah, do you have any other
information about her life?
Where she lived before?
Would you consider asking her?
- If I had any more
information on my mother,
I wouldn't bother with
any of this bullshit.
- Would you mind asking your mother
if she wouldn't mind coming here?
- My mother doesn't even know I'm here.
And she wouldn't be happy if she knew.
- Maybe I could ask your mother to come.
- Excuse me?
- Maybe she doesn't remember
where you come from.
I know the type.
Doesn't remember who
she was with last night.
- With all due respect, Mr. Ma-
- Doctor!
- I think we're done here.
If you aren't gonna give me my results,
I'd like my money back.
- I'm sure that
isn't necessary.
I don't think you're quite
what we're looking for.
Goodbye.
Ah, he responded as expected.
Follow him.
What the hell was that?
Why does that weirdo want to know
anything about my mother?
She hasn't left the sanitarium
since Dad went on the run.
No explanation.
No letter.
He vanishes and she goes insane.
What is it about me?
Why do I always attract the lunatics?
Lunatic or not,
that guy seemed important.
What does he know about me?
Why am I special?
What's this?
Hey.
- Andrew, I was so worried.
- Sorry, Mom. I was, I was a bit busy.
What happened?
- I was, um...
I was looking
into this whole DNA thing.
It sounds like a-
- Andrew,
you need to drop it.
- Mom,
they didn't find anyone
even remotely related to me.
Someone somewhere should have
done this DNA thing by now.
I think something happened to them.
Don't be silly.
- Mom, do you know something?
There's nothing to know, Andy.
My family doesn't want to speak to me.
It's just you and me.
- You're lying.
- Andrew.
What has gotten into you?
- It's just this test, Mom.
I wanted to know who I am.
You don't need a city test
to tell you who you are.
- I know.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Promise me you will drop this.
- I promise, Mom.
Look, Mom, I have to go. I
have an early rise tomorrow.
Listen, doctor.
I don't know what scam you're pulling,
but if you come near-
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
That wasn't me.
I'm sorry.
I am, sir, this isn't me!
I'm so sorry about this!
- Guys, fair enough.
How are you feeling, Mr. Cooper?
- I have no idea why
you're so interested in me.
- I'm sure you're slowly
starting to realize why.
- I have no idea how I did any of that.
I'm so sorry about your muscle.
I swear I'll stand out
of your way from now on.
- We wouldn't want that, would we?
- Listen, I-
- We flagged
certain characteristics
in your DNA profile.
We wanted and we needed to be sure.
- Are you sure that-
- That you
are special, Andrew
This is designed to
reveal certain qualities
in people like you.
- How does it work?
- I'm afraid I can't
give you that kind of information
unless you're prepared
to join the program.
But I have good news.
Your application has been fast-forwarded.
No time for frivolities. We leave now.
- I'm not going.
- I'm afraid I don't believe
you have any choice.
You can drop me off at the office.
- What about me?
- Ernesto will take
very good car of you.
It's a pity you've decided not to join us.
I was still thinking.
Don't be surprised, Mr. Cooper.
I told you, you're very special.
We can't afford to lose you.
- Well, what about my mother?
- I can personally assure
you that your mother
will be safe and secure.
- Where are we going?
And who were those people following me?
He doesn't tell you anything, does he?
You have the world's worst job, mate.
- Good evening, Andrew.
My name's Nadia.
Come in.
- Not sure I want to.
- Why is that?
- I have no idea what this place is,
who you people are or
what you want from me.
- This is a research facility.
I'm responsible for the
smooth running of the facility
and you...
You're hear to participate.
- What if I don't want to?
- No one's holding you here.
But if you do leave now,
there'll be no more help from us.
You'll be left completely alone.
- Will the men in black
leave me alone too?
- Most definitely not.
- Mom.
It's okay, Mom. Listen, listen.
You just have to go with them, okay?
Some men came after me. I don't know who.
Mom.
Mom?
Mom?
- I'm going to need that.
- What happened to my mom?
- Dr. Marinus will take good care of her.
She'll be able to call you
when she's in a safe place.
- I'm not going anywhere
until I hear from her.
- Suit yourself.
I hope you brought a tent.
It's supposed to rain tonight.
Shaan, are you okay?
- Hey, my wife said
that she can't reach
the rest of the family.
- I know, Shaan. It's a tricky situation.
- Now what will these people do with them
when they find them?
- It's hard to test. Your
children haven't been tested.
- Are you trying to suggest that I should
bring my kids here?
- No, of course not.
Not yet.
The best thing for you to do
is go through with the training
and get stronger.
Your children are safe.
That's all we can do for now.
Andrew.
I'm so glad you changed your mind.
Please go back to your room.
I'll talk to you later.
Follow me.
Let's start.
I need you to sign this.
- What is it?
- It's in case something happens to you.
It's normal procedure.
- Fine.
Where's my mother?
- Your mother is safe.
That's all I can tell you.
- Another question-
- To more pressing issues.
I need your phone.
It's too easy to track.
Good.
Now...
One last thing.
You'll stay here.
Someone will come and get
you when the dinner's ready.
Andrew.
- Hello?
Mom.
- Hey-
- Oh!
What the?
I, uh-
- Do you know what?
I don't care. Nadia sent me.
Dinner's ready. Let's go.
He was upstairs.
- What were you doing up there, Andrew?
- I got lost.
- What are you waiting for? Come eat.
- Yeah.
Hey, where's Dr. Marinus?
I need to ask him a couple of questions.
- He won't be available for a while.
He's looking for others.
- What others?
- We'll get to the details later.
- It's always later with
you people, isn't it?
- I told you, all you get out
of this mysterious bullshit
is people getting pissed.
- Fine. What do you want to know?
- Well, who are these people?
- These people are the same as you,
participants in the research
we're conducting in this facility.
- Does that mean you're gonna
conduct experiments on us?
- Oh yes, she will.
And she got pretty good at
it since we've got here too.
- We?
- My brother and I got
here the same way you did.
Dr. Marinus brought us here.
- Brother?
- Our parents adopted us.
They were scientists from Russia.
Unfortunately they decided to look
into the same topic as Dr. Marinus.
- We didn't know what to do.
Before we knew it, half
the world was chasing us.
If we was a foreign nester,
we wouldn't have made it out here alive.
- Our parents weren't that lucky.
- So if you both got
here at the same time,
how was it that you're in charge,
and he's just like one of us?
- I'm 15. Come on, man
- There's no point in me
participating in the research.
We found the limits of
my abilities very soon.
- Abilities?
- Dr. Marinus is continuing
the lifetime works
of his mother and grandfather
into sensory receptors.
The research started decades ago
with a couple of conjoined twins.
The way their brains
developed influenced the way
their sensory receptors
received information.
- In what way?
- They were able to
recognize the information
that other twins receptors were receiving
without the appropriate stimuli.
- What sort of information?
- Little things at first.
If one was eating or drinking,
the other could taste it, for example.
After decades of research, Dr. Marinus
is capable of much more.
- Like what?
- He identified the gene responsible
and the way it needs to be
altered for the individual
to be capable of these
types of communication.
That's how he was able to find you.
- Are you saying that we-
- Dr. Marinus has proven that all of you
have above average abilities.
- What kinds of abilities
are these exactly?
- Your senses, sight,
taste, smell, hearing.
We're all capable of
receiving more information
than other people.
And other things with training.
- So can you explain to me
why it was worth breaking into my home
and trying to kidnap me and my family?
- And what's going on with
the Agent Smiths out there?
- Stick these on your temples.
Yuri, would you please place
your hand on the table?
See right now,
I can see that your eyes have told you
something dangerous is about to happen.
See your brain reacted at least partially
in a way that suggested
it was your own hand
that got stabbed.
As I said earlier, if
I'm able to influence
what you think you are seeing,
I'm able to influence your reactions.
- And you think we can
do something like this?
- Not yet.
There are a couple of steps before that.
First you need to unlock your receptors.
Then you need to learn how
to receive information.
And then maybe you'll be able to send some
after a lot of training.
You're late.
- No kidding.
This place is like a maze.
How can you even afford it?
- While the others continue
with their given tasks,
let me introduce you to the procedures
you're going to go
through in this training.
The first step is always
localization and identification
which has already been
done by one of my agents
in the field.
- What do you mean?
- This may look familiar to you.
There is another thing you
would have experienced.
- Darling, you know I hate
it when you call me a thing.
You were very far away.
We needed to keep an eye on you.
If you were any weaker, the agents
would have been able to find you
- Shall we start with the training?
- Very well.
Now that you're here and safe,
we can start working on your abilities
without the risk of becoming game
to a group of highly
dangerous individuals.
- Can you guarantee that?
- I'm very happy to see you, Andrew.
Now let me show you something.
Your sensory receptors
are currently receiving
information that I have
chosen for them to receive.
None of this is real.
I've created this situation for you.
During your training,
you must learn to recognize what is real
and what I have chosen
for you to see or to feel.
- Crazy, isn't it?
- What do you expect me to do?
Everything seems so real.
- I know but it's crucial
that you train your senses
to realize that it's not.
- What do you usually do?
- Everyone has a different process.
- And everyone has a different test.
You need to overcome what
your senses are telling you
and focus on things that I can't cheat.
Use your intuition.
- That too.
- Rebecca?
- And you're Andrew, right?
- Congratulations, Andrew.
You've used your intuition.
What?
- Hey, what the fuck is this shit?
What's going on?
Hey, hey, hey, no. Fuck you, man.
Leave me alone. Get away from me.
Seriously, dude. Literally.
- He's-
- No, no,
none of this is real.
- I think he's gonna throw him!
- No, he can't get hurt.
- No, no, leave me alone, man!
- Shaan, calm down.
- I'll fuck you up!
No, dude, please! Leave, leave me alone!
- Ernesto, thank you.
I think it's
time we took a break.
Is he hurt?
- Shaan is perfectly okay.
The sedative is specifically
designed for these occasions.
It's a normal part of the training.
- Are you absolutely sure?
- I spoke to Dr. Marinus.
- Why isn't he here?
- There are other issues
he's dealing with.
All of you have proven to
have above average abilities.
How many other 20-year-olds
run their kitchen like yours?
- I don't know.
- I've personally seen you
grocery shop by smell alone.
- Is this a trick of the trade?
- No, it's not.
Your sense in smell
are extremely sensitive
because your sensory receptors
are receiving more information.
The music you play.
- I just copy the videos, I watch.
- You do know it takes people years
to do what you do, right?
It's the same for every one of you.
All of you have one or more
senses developed already.
What we need to do is help
you develop the others.
No, I mean,
there must be another way.
The trainings is just too intense.
- There isn't.
It's the training and a lot of practice.
Your abilities are there
like lead in a pencil.
The only way of getting them out
is by sharpening the pencil.
It's your mother.
- Mom.
Hi.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm so sorry
I dragged us into this.
I didn't mean to.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Are they taking care of you?
Good.
Good.
Do you know, I was just about
to practice a little violin.
Sure, of course.
Of course.
Can you hear me?
Yes, dear, I can.
I'll be fine.
I'll just listen to Andrew for a while.
- Mom? Are you still there?
Yes, yes.
The nice man who watches
me went for a cigarette.
Is there anyone with you over there?
- No, Mom. It's just me.
Andrew, listen to me.
You need to leave.
- What?
- Right now.
- Mom, do you know about this?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom?
Shit.
Mom.
- You are late for training.
Give me the phone.
Andrew.
- Shut up.
- Andrew, give it to me.
- Where is my mother?
- I, I don't know.
- You do.
Where is my mother? What happened to her?
- Andrew, I don't know.
- Don't lie to me!
- No!
Where did my mother go?
- Andrew.
- Get my mom out of there!
- Andrew.
You are late for training.
- Yeah, man, there's a reason
- Okay?
for that, Yuri, it's because
Quinn has been trained.
- I'm just saying after all this time,
you should be at least better at this.
- It's just sometimes, I don't
see the point of anything.
- Hand to eye coordination.
That's the obvious answer.
- I understand that.
That might be the only thing around here
that I understand.
- Still, one would think
after all this time
she'd at least learn something.
- Not everyone is excited
to be here like you are.
Some of us had lives.
- I had a life. I had a family.
- Yeah, in the middle of Russia.
And with your complexion,
I'm sure everyone was really
excited to have you there.
- How dare you?
- That's enough.
- What?
I'm just saying Rebecca
sucks at everything.
- Excuse me?
- Now what could
have possibly gone wrong?
- We've been training with Rebecca forever
and she's still can't
remember the simplest moves.
- Yeah and you can't tell boiled
potatoes and apples apart.
Stop being an asshole.
Maybe you should work on cooperation more.
- Why?
Why work incorporation
when we can work together?
- There are a lot of
people out there after you.
Who knows what they have ready for you.
You need to be able to trust each other.
Enjoy, everybody.
Andrew.
How are you finding the training?
- It's great.
- Are you sure?
You seem a little distracted.
- I'm great.
- That's great.
What did you tell your mother?
- Nothing.
- That's not true.
- She wanted to tell me something
when the line cut.
- What could your mother possibly know?
- You don't have to lie to me.
I saw...
DNA test results.
And how else would you explain no matches?
- What does that have
to do with your mother?
- There's only one explanation.
The agents got to them first.
She was the only one who escaped.
- I don't know about that.
What I do know is Dr.
Marinus isn't gonna let you
talk to your mother again soon.
He was very angry.
- Is she in danger?
- I don't know.
I haven't been able to speak to him since.
- What kind of place are you running here?
- The kind of place that keeps you alive.
Listen, Andrew, we need
to be very careful.
You and everyone else
here including myself,
can probably receive information
through non-sensory communication.
If someone with more practice
and stronger abilities
got their hands on this-
- Is there someone like that that?
- There has to be.
They've been doing this
research for decades.
All the people Dr. Marinus couldn't save,
they must have gone somewhere.
- So?
- The aim of the training
is not just to be able to receive
but to be able to send information.
If they knew about us,
they could make us see and
hear things that weren't real.
They'd have complete control over us
and we wouldn't even know.
We have to be careful.
- I'll be careful.
Can I go to bed now? I'm tired.
- Guys.
How long has it been since
you spoke to anyone outside?
- It's been a while.
My wife must be worried sick.
- I haven't spoken to
anyone since Wednesday.
- I tried calling my friend yesterday.
She said someone else is using the phone.
I tried again this morning. Same.
- Guys, I think it might be my fault.
I was talking to my mom and I-
- What did you do?
- She asked me if I was alone.
And then she was trying to warn me.
- What are you talking about?
- Nadia said she's gonna fix the phones.
It's gonna take a couple of days.
- A couple of days? That's just great.
That's just great.
- No, I didn't mean
to cause trouble.
It's my mom but I think
she might know something.
- Why would you think that?
- She does?
- Of course she doesn't.
She's just an old lady.
- What did she say, Andrew?
- I don't know. She was trying to...
The call dropped.
And I think she was telling me...
I think she was trying to warn me.
She was telling me to leave.
- Are you ready for the
next part of your training?
- Yuri.
Yuri.
Yuri, what's the code?
- Ah!
- Nadia will be very proud
that you've taken this
cooperation exercise to heart.
It was a beautiful cooperation
between Andrew's
situation and Yuri's eyes.
- Are you seeing this?
- I prefer not to
interfere with the program
as planned for you.
- He was, he was gonna pull
the trigger or something.
- Physical damage doesn't
happen quite as you would expect
when creating these situations.
- But he will get hurt, right?
- Theoretically, it
depends on the individual
creating the situation.
May is strong, but she cannot create
an experience strong
enough to cause death.
- Is there someone stronger than May?
- There might've been.
The research records
weren't kept quite as well
as I would've liked.
Help me!
- Stop!
Help!
- Panic won't help.
You need to remember
that this is a situation
- Help me, please!
- we created for you.
And you know how to make sense of it.
Don't focus on that.
You can't trust what your
senses are telling you.
- What happened?
- I've made it a little easier for you.
Look around.
- It's night.
- No it's not. It's light.
- Don't focus on that.
Think about what brought you here.
- Andrew.
Andrew!
- What happened?
- Nothing happened, Nadia.
Everyone is tired.
- Go. Rest before dinner.
These look strong.
- You and I both know
how fast that can change.
- He is just-
- He is just talented.
- He's been here days. Not even a month.
And he's already created
that.
- Are you scared?
No. Not you.
You're jealous.
He struggled with a few hallucinations-
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
He's going to hurt someone.
- He's not that good.
- Dr. Marinus promised us we'd be safe.
Yuri and I.
Don't break that promise.
- Hello?
Where are...
I'm coming!
I'm coming! Hold on!
Hurry, open, May!
May, aw, Jesus!
Open up, May! Open the window!
Hold on! Hold on, May!
May, step away!
- That'd be a pass.
Not a bad time, either.
- Unbelievable, man. This is so unfair.
So unfair, like everyone has a go, right?
And you can miss it sometimes.
Give me another go. Come on, man.
This is bullshit.
Thanks.
- Please, put the headphones in.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I would like to personally
congratulate you
on completing the first
stage of our training
and passing a very important test.
It is very important for the
next steps of this program
and for your survival
outside of this facility,
to be able to recognize what your senses
are telling you to see,
hear, feel, smell, or taste,
is not compatible with
the reality around you.
Every step on this journey makes it easier
and safer for you to be
able to leave this facility.
Please do your very best
to pass the next steps
as well as you passed this one.
I am aware that everyone's
abilities are on different levels
and we are slowly recognizing
who is capable of what.
I am very sad to inform you
that Mr. Aria didn't
reach the results required
on this test.
Please, do not
- All right, yeah, let me
- worry about him.
- listen to what he's saying.
- He will be very well taken care of.
- I'll do again!
What's he saying?
- I will leave you now
- Let me just do it again!
- in very good hands.
Almost as good as mine.
- What the hell?
They can't expect us just to move on.
- You seem disappointed.
I prefer to be honest.
- How do you know my mother?
- Straight to the difficult questions.
- I prefer to be honest.
- I know her.
I used to.
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.
I hope so.
But she and Dr. Marinus,
they have history.
- Why wouldn't she tell me?
- To keep you safe.
- She said, when I came
here, I called her.
She told me to leave.
- It's too late for that now.
Marinus knows about you.
- Is he the bad guy?
- In your mother's story, he is.
She thinks he's like his mother.
- Why wouldn't she tell me?
What's she afraid of?
- Dr. Marinus' grandfather
started his research
in concentration camps,
cutting into the brains of conjoined twins
until they were able to
do what he asked them to.
They thought it was
because they were twins.
They brought in so many more,
thinking they'd be able
to do the same thing.
I was the only one who survived for years.
Until your father arrived.
- Where is he?
- I thought he died
helping your mother escape.
You can't leave.
If you think Marinus is dangerous,
you wouldn't stand a
chance against the others.
- What others?
Dr. Forrester and Dr. Kimura.
They were the two main
scientists in the camps.
When the war ended, they parted ways
to remain inconspicuous.
Dr. Kimura and his students
are much more traditional.
In the concentration camp kind of sense.
- Students? Are they trained.
Are they as good as you?
- No.
Not as good as me.
You don't need to worry about them.
They would have to meet you,
touch you to be able to do anything.
- What about my mother?
- Marinus knows not to get
on the wrong side of you.
Would make his work much more difficult.
- What about Shaan? What happens to him?
- If he can't tell what's real,
his gift will be a burden to him.
He'll have to hide for
the rest of his life.
- Why can't he stay here?
- Nadia didn't it was safe for him here,
which is funny because her
abilities are much more limited.
She is safe here.
And she's up to something.
- It isn't safe.
Why would I, why would anyone stay here?
- Because if you stay,
I will teach you the most amazing things.
Let me show you something.
- Oh, aw!
Aw, aw! Was that-
- Yes, that was your father.
I know who he is and I
know how to find him,
if he's still alive.
- And how do I know
you aren't just making this up?
- You don't.
But I can teach you.
- Where am I going?
- You tell me.
You're the one driving.
- I though this was your situation.
- I only created the world.
You're the one moving freely
because you always had a choice, Andrew.
- This isn't freedom.
- If you want to leave,
just drop them at their destination.
- What do you mean, dr...
No!
- I know you're exhausted
but we need to continue.
Your father is waiting for you.
He wants to know you.
I can take you to him.
But first you must do as I say.
- This is unreal.
You lie and you make
promises that you can't keep.
This has to stop.
More and more people will only get hurt.
You can choose to stop this.
- This is me and my sister.
My parents knew not to quit like this.
She didn't last long enough
for me to remember her.
I never had a choice in this.
- You aren't innocent.
You hurt others.
- Not if I could help it.
How's everyone doing today?
- I think I'll be able to swap soon.
- Sending information is three
times as hard as we imagined.
There's no point in rushing it.
- Oh, I though you were
here to teach them.
- Darling, would you please
stop with all the antagonizing.
It's not helping morale.
- But Dr. Mar-
- Dr. Marinus wouldn't be
happy to know you're trying to
do things I strictly forbid.
- Are you...
Is everything okay?
- Watch out.
- Andrew? I need your help.
Yuri's not in his room.
- He...
Yuri?
Yuri?
Yuri?
Yuri?
- Andrew.
Put this in your mouth.
Please.
- What happened?
- Shh.
She'll hear you.
- Oh, oh, shit.
Hey, I saw you in my room.
Can you do that again?
- Nadia's not gonna hurt us.
- No she didn't, she...
- She heard us.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- No time for explanations.
Get out of the van.
This is the end of your training.
May's coming.
- Are you okay?
I asked if you were okay.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Please, I, I wanted to speak to you
about your DNA test results.
There've been a number of issues.
Unfortunately, we couldn't
find a match for you.
- That sounds unlikely.
- Oh, actually, it's more
common than you might think.
Although our database is large,
sometimes we do strike out.
- What are you saying?
- What we suggest in these cases
is that we share your information
with some other agencies.
A waiver will be required.
Perfect.
We'll be in touch.
Yeah.
- May I come inside?
I have a couple of questions.
- What can I help you with?
- Three bodies have been found shot dead
on the side of the road.
- What the hell do I have to do with that?
- Can I show you some photographs?
Why don't you get us some water?
Do you recognize any of these people?
- I've never seen any of them in my life.
- Are you sure?
Do you want me to show them again?
- I'm sure I've never seen any of them.
- That's very strange, Mr. Cooper,
because your DNA's been
found all over that scene.
- That's not possible. I have never...
I should not be speaking to you.
I need a lawyer
- Mr. Cooper,
you don't need a lawyer if you
haven't done anything wrong.
- Something's not right.
Someone is trying to fr-
- Frame you for a murder
you didn't commit?
- I couldn't have done this!
- This isn't the first
case I've seen like this
in the last couple of months.
People claiming they have no memory
of what they did while they supposedly
committed the murders.
- Where have you been
for the last five hours?
- Working. I was working.
I went to a meeting in the afternoon
for my DNA test results.
- With this man?
- Doctor!
- What the fuck?
- And what happened in that meeting?
- He asked me to sign a release.
- And that took five hours?
We've been watching Dr. Marinus.
His family have been involved
in government research for decades.
This is you arriving.
And this is you leaving
five hours later.
- I don't know. What am I
supposed to have been invo...
- Mr. Cooper, do you have any idea
how they could have administered a drug?
- No.
- We have a couple of ideas
when the former might have been taken.
- Maybe, I...
Wait, why, why are they doing this to me?
Why me?
- Random pick?
Or they could be looking for people
with some kind of predisposition.
- What kind of predisposition?
- Your father's.
- My father?
I don't even know my father.
- I imagine your mother
doesn't speak about him much.
- I don't know anything about him.
How could he be important?
- Family history of mental illness
has been a common denominator.
I'm not like him.
- That's not what I meant.
We assume they're looking
for a genetic predisposition
to react desirably with the
drug they're administering.
Different brains react
differently to different drugs.
They're looking for
very specific reaction.
- What kind of reaction?
- A distortion in sensory processing
based on what the other
suspects have described.
The drug allows the sensory receptors
to completely overwhelm the brain.
The hallucinations are
just an exaggerated version
of what actually happened.
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to think very hard
about what you what you remember.
- I fought someone.
Let's go.
Get in.
- No.
- Him?
Based on his reputation,
I don't think the fight
would have lasted too long.
- I don't know, I mean,
it all just seems a bit too much.
- Please try to focus.
The drug needs to be
re-administered regularly.
They would have had to give
it to you multiple times.
- What does this mean for me?
I mean, I can't be held
responsible for this.
Can I?
- Mr. Cooper,
everything will be okay
as long as you cooperate
- No, they, they've planted
all of this on me, I...
I can't...
I had nothing to do with this.
- Mr. Cooper,
I promise you, I'm on your side.
You just have to tell me the
truth about what's happened.
And then I can catch the
people that did this.
Would you like some water?
- No.
- So what happened next?
- Rebecca?
I was on a bus.
They were driving me somewhere.
- Any idea how long you were driving for?
- It felt like...
I don't know.
- Anything else?
- There was some other people there.
There was a woman.
I think, I think she'd
been following me before.
- Is this her?
- Darling, you know I hate
it when you call me a thing.
- Was she part of the experiment?
- We don't know who she is.
She works for Dr. Marinus.
- Rebecca!
Rebecca.
- No, help me!
Help me, Andrew! Please!
- I want this to be over.
It's night.
But why is it night?
- No it's not.
It's light.
- Think about what brought you here.
You have a job to do. Focus.
- I think she was telling
me to do something.
- Can you remember what it was?
- I don't know. I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.
- You can trust me.
- There was this orange room with a safe.
The code was 5, uh, 7-5-1-0.
There was a gun.
- Did the gun look like this?
Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you touch it?
- I held it, yeah.
But I haven't killed anyone.
- Well that's what we're trying
to figure out, aren't we?
- What do you mean? I
thought you were on my side?
- Of course I am, Mr. Cooper.
We can't just let you go.
Can we?
What if it repeats itself?
Anything else?
I promise you, Mr. Cooper,
your life will be much, much easier
if you decide to tell us the truth
about what you remember.
- I'm not saying anything
more unless I have a lawyer.
- That won't be necessary.
It's your mother.
It's your mother.
I need your phone.
Andrew Cooper.
Please call your mother.
Mom.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Sorry I didn't respond.
Mom, they didn't find anybody
even remotely related to me.
- Put this in your mouth.
Please.
Different brains react

of what actually happened.
- Ah!
Jesus! Open up, May, open the window!
I think we need to touch you
up a little bit more, don't we?
Yes, Dr. Marinus, I
have decided to continue
with the training.
They're struggling.
- You don't know what
struggling looks like.
I've personally seen
the classified footage
from the first experiments.
- Back when the organization was overrun
by defective Nazis, huh?
I think we can do better, don't you?
- Now then, get rid of Shaan.
- Ernesto.
- What's he saying?
I'll go again!
What's he saying?
Let me just do it again!
This is bullshit, man!
- My brother and I got
here the same way you did.
Dr. Marinus brought us here.
- Brother?
- You're so nice to me.
Our parents adopted us.
It's Stockholm syndrome.
- Our client's targets are Quinn,
Rebecca,
and Yuri.
- What are you doing?
- Mr. Cooper, please.
Investigation terminated.
Ready when you are.
- Good evening, Andrew.
Nadia.
How much does he know?
He remembers everything.
Recognizes everyone.
Even me.
- I'm afraid I have some
bad news, Mr. Cooper.
Earlier today, you
committed three murders.
- No, it's not possible.
That's not possible.
- Believe me, I was there.
- No, I...
- Would you like to hear more?
No, no!
- This drug, if administered correctly,
allows us to take control
of your actions with ease.
Maybe even make you feel like
a hero in your own story.
You'll obey almost every command
if introduced by an appropriate stimuli.
I didn't,
I didn't do anything.
- Forensic evidence
would suggest otherwise.
- You can't do this to me.
- Unfortunately, that's
exactly what we did.
- But you just have to know the truth
about what's happening to you.
- I, I just, let me go, okay?
I won't tell anyone.
- I'm afraid that's not possible
at this stage of your training.
- I just wanna tell you.
I don't want to work for you anymore.
- Maybe you'd like a glass of water?
- What about the facil, facility?
- Take a seat, Mr. Cooper.
- Why am I here then?
We had to test if
your memories and recollections
would lead anyone back to our program.
- I, I didn't do anything though.
- That doesn't mean you
won't speak about it.
- It's working.
- This will help you see
the world in a new light.
After all, it did come from
LSD all those years ago.
- Hey, Andrew!
We did it.
We've completed the training.
We've come to the end.
It was all a test.
Look.
They gave me this.
This will unlock all of our abilities.
We'll be like superheroes. You and me.
We'll be like gods.
All of this,
all of this will be ours.
You and me.
If I can save them all,
I'm the hero.
