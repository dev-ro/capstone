Howdy.
Owner's got a couch that's also puke color.
Thinks there's something wrong
with the engine.
Said, "it's making a funny noise."
It wasn't hilarious.
- Transmission?
- Transmission.
If this is a surprise party,
somebody missed the cue.
- Brad.
- Bradley.
Bradley.
Come in my office.
You can tell it out here.
I don't work in an office.
I don't need to squeeze into one
to hear some bad news.
- It's a tough time for businesses right now.
- I'm not really interested in the economy.
Am I gettin' laid off?
I'm sorry.
I'll clear out my locker.
Don't take my artwork.
I won't!
- James?
- Yeah?
- You know where the bolt cutters are at?
- In the storeroom...
...buried.
I'll exhume them.
Thanks.
Bradley?
- You okay?
- South of okay, north of cancer.
When things pick up around here,
I'll make sure Dean calls you.
I said the same shit to Pete
when he got booted.
Thanks.
What's going on? Why are you home so early?
I got fired.
You got fired?
Give me your cellphone.
No. Give it!
I've been seeing somebody.
Get in the house.
I didn't mean...
Get out! Get in the house.
I'm sorry.
- Should I go? I can clear out.
- Let's talk.
- Bradley, let me put something...
- Sit.
How long?
Three months.
Serious?
No.
Why?
Well, I don't know exactly. I'm...
I was sad.
And we haven't been close since...
...you know.
I know.
I thought maybe you
were doing the same thing.
You were staying out late every night,
coming to bed after I was asleep.
No.
I was working or working out.
And staying clear.
I didn't know.
Communication between us...
there hasn't been much.
Did you fall off the wagon?
Almost. Did you?
No.
Do you want to end it with us?
I don't know.
I want things to be different
than they've been.
Our marriage, us, we've...
...it's like when I go into the minimart
at the gas station and get coffee.
They got those three metal containers there.
One's got cream, one's got milk...
...and the other's got
that gray-lookin' skim stuff.
Every time I go in there,
those labels are faced away...
...and I have to guess which one's
the real stuff, the cream.
But every time...
...the first container
I grab is always that...
...milk or that skim stuff.
It's never the one I want.
The law of averages says
one out of three times, I...
...I ought to get the cream,
but it doesn't happen.
Maybe if I go in there a thousand times...
...it'll even out like it should.
I'll have a run of...
...pickin' out the cream fifty
or a hundred times in a row, but...
...I don't think so.
I don't think things even out fair like that.
Look at us.
I think we should start again.
Try to have another baby.
We don't pick up where things
went bad for us...
...the miscarriage... we're through.
I've thought about that, too, but...
...I only get called in to substitute
once or twice a week.
You just lost your job.
I'm gonna call Gil.
You're gonna be a drug dealer?
No. I'm gonna drive packages for a friend.
You said you would never work for Gil.
So we're both breaking promises today.
I want us in a better home
than this shithole.
With kids and happy.
I'm tired of getting
the goddamn skim milk and...
...hoping that luck brings out
the cream, 'cause it won't, not ever.
This won't be forever. I promise.
Will you abide?
Yeah.
Give me some time before you get close.
Okay.
- Hey, Johnny rebel.
- Howdy.
- You gonna give me a sample this time?
- Talk to your boss.
Come on. Let me earn it direct.
I promise I can put a great big smile
on each of those nuts.
No thanks. They don't want
anyone to see their braces.
- What's the weather like?
- Chance of snow.
Step up to the window.
Put it in the drawer.
Here, put it on the scale.
She's porcine.
What are you doing?
The ritual that happens after you buy
the groceries but before you eat them.
I don't want you handling a knife right now.
Please, put that down.
I am competent.
What if you cut yourself and
started bleeding and passed out?
Spilled boiling water or something?
How come you let me work in "The Kitchen
of Perils" before I was pregnant?
Because you're resilient.
Well, are we just gonna
eat takeout for four months?
I can grill things.
- How's Koala?
- She's good.
- And Mama Koala?
- I'm good, but my feet hurt.
That's 'cause you shouldn't
be on them right now.
- How was work?
- Yeah, it was.
Too much sun this time of day.
Need to get some better curtains in here.
Green ones.
Howdy.
Okay, I'll be right over.
Adios.
Gil?
- Evenin'.
- Nice to see you. Come in.
Did your dad pick out that outfit?
He did. You like it?
- Zesty.
- He's in the pool room.
The one with the pool or...
or with the pool table?
The table. He calls it
the billiards room, but I don't know.
- It's just pool he plays in there.
- Thanks.
- Que pasa?
- Hey.
In the fridge.
Jill got you your faggoty mineral water.
I didn't know H-2-O's
got a sexual orientation.
- Where's this guy?
- En route.
- How'd the transaction go?
- Never a problem with Cuz.
Yeah, I like that nigger.
Or is it... is it "nigga"
with an A at the end...
...when you're saying it nice?
Don't think someone like you
can say that word any way polite.
- How's Lauren?
- Good.
- When's she dumping out the kid?
- 98 days.
You planning on staying in the delivery room?
Of course. That's something
I wouldn't give up for anything.
Plug up your nose...
...and wear sunglasses so they don't
know when you're shutting your eyes.
I want to watch our baby girl
draw her first breath.
- That's a moment.
- It's a moment, all right.
That'll be Eleazar.
That's the new source?
If this deal goes well,
I'll be partnering with him.
He's got lines to Mexico and a steady
stream of good, cheap crystal.
- Just wanted to meet you before the pickup.
- Sounds like he brought amigos.
Mexicans ain't comfortable being by
themselves. You know how they grow up.
Five to a bed. 10 beds per adobe.
Good evening, my friend.
How are you? This is Bradley.
He's my top runner.
Howdy.
Nice to meet you.
This is Pedro, one of the men who
will accompany you during the pickup.
This is Roman, the other.
I'm not doing a pickup with him.
- And for what reason?
- He looks like he's using.
Roman's been clean for two years.
I test my employees.
He's extremely reliable, and he knows
what to do in adverse situations.
Sorry.
Words from a stranger don't drop instinct.
Bradley.
Give us a moment. Let me talk to you.
I need you to go along...
...protect my interests.
Our interests.
Eleazar swears by the guy.
It ain't like you haven't had
your problems before.
That's 14 years done.
- The bottle ain't the same thing as junk.
- Don't kid yourself with that bullshit.
You look at my brother and your old man.
Boozin's a bad decision that leads
to 10,000 more and then the last one.
The guy is juiced.
- Maybe not junk, but...
- Bradley.
Don't make me give you an ultimatum.
Sounds like you just gave me one.
I can't give this to Oscar
or Tony or Randolph.
No one elbows guys like those...
...on a shipment this big. I need you.
You help me set up this partnership, I'll
give you two months off when your baby's born.
Three.
Done. We're good.
I'll go.
But if something comes up, I got the reins.
They shall mind you.
Roman, look at me.
If I say "dump the package," what do you do?
Dump.
Amen.
I felt her.
I felt you.
I felt you.
97 days.
Hold right here.
- Put your hands in your back pockets.
- Man, fuck you. I don't give...
Go against me and you two can swim
out on your own and do the pickup.
Roman, esc√∫chale.
Don't want you shooting an innocent tarp.
Turn around.
Let's go.
That one.
- This is yours, Blanco?
- Gil's.
Get rid of the trunk.
Let's go, bro.
Help make America beautiful, right?
Chill, Blanco. Tranquilo.
It's only for protection.
Pickup's done, Blanco.
Try and take this one, I'll break your jaw.
- Dump. We'll pick them up later.
- No. I'm...
Blanco, release it.
Drop your weapons and put up your hands!
- We shot three.
- We need help!
Run! Now!
Call for backup, now!
You stupid, stupid assholes.
Get down!
Officer down!
- Come out right now!
- Eat a dick, pig!
You ready for 9/11 part two?
Grenade! Go!
No, Jesus, no.
Cover me!
Good night.
Eight ball, corner pocket.
Throw down your weapons!
Pig, this is what I'll throw!
- Go, go, go, go!
- Dispatch, multiple 10-53s.
Officers down!
- Freeze!
- Hands on your head, now!
Don't move, asshole!
Give him jewelry.
You want to burn it?
You want to wipe your ass with it?
You want to cut it up in little pieces
and send them to Putin?
I have one over my front door.
So you're a patriot?
You mind if I sit?
I'm going to assume that's rhetorical.
Would you rather I leave?
I'm not gonna tell you anything
you want to hear.
And prison will give me plenty of time
to look at guys I don't like.
What is it that you think I want to hear?
The names of your associates?
The people who profited from your hard work
while they wiped their dirty asses with that?
You can pretend you don't hear,
but I saw that video.
I saw how you took down those lowlifes
when they went up against the police...
...even though you could've got away clean.
I knew before you told me that you
got an American flag in your home.
You probably got more than one.
I got two.
Because of your selfless actions,
no police were killed in that event...
...which tells me that you know
the difference between right and wrong...
...and that you have a moral compass.
So help us. Give us some names.
Or give me one important name.
- Who are you working for?
- I work alone.
- Who supplies your crystal?
- Some guy.
- Some guy got a name?
- I forgot.
Would you remember
if I showed you a list of names?
Don't like to read. Won't even
see a movie if it's got subtitles.
What would happen if I read them aloud?
You wouldn't even have to say anything.
Just nod your head up and down.
I'll narrow it down for you.
What's your name?
- Detective Lawrence Watkins.
- That wasn't it.
- You find this humorous?
- Your tricks are.
Every once in a while,
I see a man in that chair...
...who could just as easily be
on this side of the table...
...a man principled...
...who had a run of bad luck
and just went the wrong way.
I'm not gonna talk.
I know that this is your first offense,
but you're looking at 4 years, maybe 5.
Do you know that drug traffickers
actually serve those sentences?
I'm aware that the system is harder
on guys that distribute drugs...
...than it is on men who commit acts
of violence against women and children.
Do you think that's fair?
You ever see a man with meth mouth?
- You ever see the 14-year-old girl who's...
- I'm not gonna argue with you, Larry.
I'm not gonna give you any info.
I know what I did...
...and I know what the sentence is gonna be.
It's done.
- You have other options.
- I don't.
Your wife told me that
you were gonna have a baby girl.
You'll be in prison
when she says her first word...
...and I guarantee you that word
will not be "Daddy."
- I need to keep it in good taste.
- Yeah, it tasted pretty good.
Sit.
I gave them your change of clothes.
Thanks.
I got some stuff I want to say.
- Okay.
- I don't want you at the hearing.
I know how it's gonna go,
and there's no point for you...
...turning up to watch it happen.
I'm not contending the charges.
I want to be there. I want to be supportive.
Well, that won't be any good for anybody.
Actually, it'll make things harder.
There's no reason for you and the Koala to...
...go through that experience...
...for me to watch you go through it, so...
...please.
Okay.
It's gonna be four years, maybe five, and...
...I have to serve most of it,
if not every damn day.
Sorry.
I will visit as much as I'm allowed,
and I'll bring our girl.
No. I don't want the first time
for her to see me to be in prison.
We'll come up with something
to tell her when she is old enough...
...to know something's wrong and...
...I'll give her the full truth when
she's old enough to understand.
Okay.
I'll wait for you.
No matter how long it is.
I will never, never make that mistake again.
- I promise you.
- I know.
So that's it, then.
I love you.
I considered the defendant's plea
of nolo contendre...
...and also the very serious
nature of his crimes.
I hereby sentence Bradley Darrel Thomas
to be incarcerated for seven years...
...at the Franklin R. James
Medium Security Detention Center.
This hearing has come
to its lawful conclusion.
Even on the outside, that's some dismal shit.
You seen those pictures
of that prison in Austria?
Man, I wish we were going there.
You should aim higher with your wishes.
Gentlemen, listen up.
Follow the red line to the door.
Stop there.
Tell your name to the man with the clipboard.
Bradley Thomas.
Proceed.
Enrique Gomez.
Welcome to the Fridge.
Russell Harris.
Next.
Return yourself to the end of the line.
- I was next. I just had to run to...
- Maintain your place in line...
...or you relinquish it.
Take yourself back to the end of the line.
That's not fair.
I had to run to the bathroom.
You're delaying the entire process
for everybody.
Remove yourself.
- Worse than the DMV.
- Next.
Next.
Bradley Thomas.
Do you have a receipt for the ring?
- Receipt? No.
- Put it in there.
Why?
Inmates are not allowed
to possess any jewelry...
...which is a value of more than $75.
Well, it's made out of stainless steel...
I'm neither a metallurgist nor a jeweler.
I cannot attest to its value.
Relinquish it now.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Reclaim your possessions...
...and take your place at the end of the line.
Next.
Next.
Bradley Thomas.
I recall.
Well...
...that's better.
Best to remain civilized, Mr. Thomas.
Even in a prison.
Enjoy your stay.
- Bradley Thomas?
- Yes.
Stand inside the box.
Remove your clothing. Leave your underwear
on until I tell you to lower them.
- You can put your clothing in that box.
- I figured.
Looks like we're locking up another genius.
Should we let him go so he can cure cancer?
Help the sciences unify string theories?
Legs apart.
Hands on top of your head.
Open your mouth.
Lift up your tongue.
You can shut it.
Now for everybody's favorite part.
Lower your drawers.
Put your hands on top of your head.
He's an A-minus.
Are you Bradley Thomas?
- I am.
- I'm Lefty.
I'm in charge of your orientation.
You got bunions?
My right foot's injured, and these
shoes are about two sizes too small.
We'll tell Denise. She's your case worker.
Can you walk for now?
As far as prisons go,
you could do worse than the Fridge.
Though this place sure
isn't like that one in Austria.
You get a private cell.
It's small, but you aren't breathing
someone else's stale air...
...for months or years,
trying not to hate them.
And you got some choices
over in prison industries...
...depending on your case worker's evaluation.
Desks, shelves, jeans, vending machine parts.
We make a lot of stuff here.
Food's awful, but, hell, it's prison.
How long have you been in here?
28 years. And I was in Jackson before here.
They called me Righty over there.
You can ask.
Well, it ain't my business.
People who don't ask you what you did...
...are the ones who don't want
to talk about what they did.
You're a fit guy.
Looks like you could handle trouble,
but it's better if you ask...
...and better if you tell. You don't
want people making assumptions.
I've seen guys twice your size picking
their teeth out of the shower drain...
...and I've seen worse.
And if you hurt women or kids
or something like that...
...you should come up with a lie right now...
...and stick to it.
I ran H and crystal.
Some coke.
I murdered two men in a stick-up.
Shot one of them in the head four times.
Was...
...on junk at the time.
What floor is my cell on?
The scenic.
- This is the guy they're putting in seven?
- Yeah. Bradley Thomas.
Before you go in your coffin,
there's some rules to apprise you of.
Five days a week,
I do the count on this floor.
If you hear that buzzer go, you come out
your room, you wait to be counted.
You don't go back until you hear
that buzzer again, no matter what.
You miss the count,
sleep through it, whatever...
...the rest of the floor waits around
for you to be found.
It's not a great way to make friends.
I do the inspections, too.
I call out, "Inspection!"
You come out your room
and you wait outside until I'm through.
- You box?
- No.
Them muscles just for show?
Helps me lift stuff.
There's a boxing program here, a good one.
- I'm one of the coaches.
- Not interested.
What? You'd rather make desks
and parts for vending machines?
I'd rather knit baby booties with pink yarn
than hit people for no reason.
You ever tried? Boxing?
I spent some time in the ring
when I was younger.
Yeah. You get whooped?
No.
Pay wasn't good enough?
You ever hurt somebody? Kill a guy?
Pester him some other time.
Doors are unlocked when guys
are at prison industries...
...or the yard or in class.
- There's a school here.
- That's good.
This one's yours.
I'll leave you alone
while you check things out.
- Dinner's at 6:00.
- I think I'll skip it today.
Lots of guys skip dinner
when they first get here.
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, you'll want it.
I'll take you to see
your case worker tomorrow.
Thanks.
Seven fucking years.
Christ.
Line up!
Someone's missing from the line,
so we gotta wait!
I hope none of you mind.
I got a dream I gotta get back to.
There was a woman.
- She was plump, but she was willing.
- We're waiting!
Thank you for joining our little
get-together, Mr. Thomas.
Damn. What happened?
Stepped on a bug.
You're bullshitting.
It was a big one.
That necessary?
Pretend like you're talking to God.
He doesn't smell like nachos.
You're not off to a good start, Mr. Thomas.
The whole floor is standing out here
in the middle of the night...
...tired, hungry...
...waiting for me to finish the count,
and you're making jokes.
Any more clever remarks?
You hear that buzzer,
you come out and get counted.
No delay.
Like the bell at the beginning
of a boxing match.
Ding-ding.
Should've told him about the bug.
Oh, Christ.
Oh, please.
Oh, please.
Get out of here!
Morning count!
Eight days.
Morning.
That gets hard to say after
waking up here a thousand times.
I bet.
Thanks for the candy bar.
I told you.
Your industry assignments, your visits...
...all that sort of stuff go through Denise.
You want her to like you, so be respectful...
...and don't look below her neck...
...and don't make implications.
The women in here
are real sensitive to that stuff.
I smuggled in two kilos of southern charm.
She's got a nice set.
Come in.
I'm Denise Pawther.
I'm not sure you want to shake my hand.
Next time. You are Bradley Thomas?
I wish I wasn't.
- Please, sit.
- Thanks, ma'am.
How was your first night in the Fridge?
Lacking in some departments,
but I heard this place isn't a reward.
- Did you sleep?
- Some.
- Did you eat?
- Lefty gave me a candy bar.
Normally we'd go over your file
and discuss your assignments.
But I received a call 20 minutes ago
that is a priority.
From who?
Dr. Pelman.
Dr. Pelman's your wife's obstetrician.
He said there were some
complications in the pregnancy...
...and wanted to discuss
the matter with you in person.
Is...
...is it serious?
He did not go over details with me.
- He's coming here?
- Correct.
We've scheduled an appointment at 10:00.
Where's Lauren? The hospital?
I don't know.
We'll finish the orientation tomorrow.
Have some breakfast and return to your cell.
An officer will come and get you as soon
as Dr. Pelman signs in to the outer gate.
Have there been difficulties?
With our first one, but not this time around.
I appreciate you letting me know.
Hope everything goes well.
You must be pretty popular.
Getting a visitor on your second day.
Maybe they came to interview you?
See a boxing legend?
Walk through slowly.
Sending in Bradley Thomas.
Copy. His guest is at window 10.
Have fun.
It's that one, Mr. Thomas.
Who are you?
Sit down, Mr. Thomas.
- Where's Dr. Pelman?
- Sit down.
Pick up the phone.
Remain calm. If you call
any attention to us, I will leave.
And you will regret my departure
for the rest of your life.
Nod that you understand.
My employer sends his regards.
You work for Eleazar.
Why are you here?
Your betrayal cost my employer $3.2 million.
I'm here to settle that matter.
There is an abortionist from Korea.
He works for my employer.
He claims...
...that he can clip the limbs of a fetus...
...yet leave the child in such a condition
that it will live to be born.
This little operation will only happen...
...if you don't pay your debt to my employer.
- How?
- There is a prisoner...
...who my employer wants dead.
He is serving a life sentence
at the Redleaf Detention Center.
I'm in the Fridge for seven years.
How in the hell am I supposed to
choke out some guy over in Redleaf?
Redleaf is maximum security.
Show the staff here
that you have to be transferred.
If I nail this guy...
...Eleazar will let my wife go...
...unharmed?
Yes.
Can you give me some sort of guarantee?
Certainly.
If you don't do what
my employer wants you to do...
...I guarantee you will receive a package...
...with nothing less than two limbs
of your unborn child.
Sadly, I cannot guarantee
if your child will survive...
...or what the fate of your wife will be.
Who's this guy I'm supposed to get?
Christopher Bridge...
...and he is in Redleaf cell block 99.
6'4".
6'2" at most.
6'4".
6'5".
Maybe.
You okay?
There anything you want to talk about?
Look, I'm sorry for busting you earlier.
I didn't mean anything by it.
I was just hoping to get you in the
prison boxing program, you know?
- What are you doing?
- Feet hurt.
Well, wait till you get back
to your coffin, okay?
Man, I'm telling you...
You don't want to do this.
You better stop now.
You done fucked up right now!
This motherfucker's crazy.
- Holy shit.
- Hands on your head. Now!
- Andre, you okay?
- What the fuck took you so long?
You didn't press the alarm.
I interfered with that,
but he screams pretty good.
Shut the fuck up.
Give me a reason to turn
your face into a cocktail.
Don't scare me like that. I might
curl up on the floor like your buddy.
I know a joke.
Want to hear the punch line?
- Give him bracelets.
- Give me your wrists.
Dre...
...want to get some justice
before we take him down?
I recommend he uses his right arm.
Stay with him.
Take this redneck down
to the lower level for holding.
Walk.
- Why the hell did you do this?
- He didn't like my shoes.
Hold it! Hold it!
Damn it!
Inspect the floor.
- Nathan.
- Yeah?
Would you like to give him some justice?
You bet. Goddamn nutcase.
Hope you like it over in Redleaf.
- Longman.
- Yeah?
How old's Redleaf?
Older than you.
So what, '60s?
When did they start making that big fuss
about humane treatment for prisoners?
Late '50s.
Redleaf's from before then.
Get vertical.
- What's your name?
- Sean Waterford.
And the name of your prisoner is?
Bradley Thomas. You should have
received the paperwork earlier.
Don't tell me my business.
I do things direct, and I have a system.
Sorry.
This is the fella who likes
to beat up officers?
Yes.
How many of your boys did he take down?
Two are in the hospital,
a third sustained minor injuries.
He whipped three of you?
We tried, but...
Mr. Thomas.
Look at me.
The Redleaf Detention Center
is classified as a maximum-security facility.
But there's another term I prefer...
...one that I think will
give you a clearer picture.
Minimum freedom.
If you make trouble...
...your minimum freedom will get smaller.
So small that it becomes microscopic.
Do you understand?
- I do.
- Put a "sir" on that.
I do, sir.
Dump that out.
The men here aren't like those faggots
over there at the Fridge.
You can test us if you want to.
Prisoners are expensive,
and we're only too happy...
...to help the state balance its budget
by deploying some cheap lead.
Unlock Mr. Thomas so that he
can change into his neons.
Bad news, Mr. Thomas.
Our examination room is under renovation.
So you're gonna have to strip out here.
Wilson.
Give Mr. Thomas a full cavity inspection.
How about my things?
My ring.
I'll look for them tomorrow.
If I can find the time.
This is the transfer from the Fridge.
Bradley Thomas.
Cell block 12. Cell 44.
You mean 56.
That's what I meant. Read it wrong. It's 56.
Take him over.
It's up here on your right.
The toilet doesn't work, but that doesn't
seem to stop people from using it.
Hold here.
Walk in or get dragged in. Your choice.
Put your hands through.
Behave yourself for two weeks,
and you'll get another cell.
If you go wild like you did in the Fridge...
...you'll stay in here for years.
Lunch!
I can't eat in here.
The toilet's full up with shit.
James, make a note.
Prisoner Thomas in 56 refuses to eat.
Thomas!
Yeah?
Put your shirt on
if you want to go to the yard.
Come out and shut the door.
You get 60 minutes.
Behave and you'll get more.
You go wild, you'll live
in that cell 24 hours a day.
My name's Derrick.
Bradley.
- I'm gonna go work out.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You do not want to get near those guys.
I have some questions.
- Ask.
- Do you know a guy...
...named Christopher Bridge...
- ...inmate in here?
- I haven't heard of him.
Which one of these guys
are from cell block 99?
None of them.
Where are they?
Isolated from the rest of the prison.
Who do they keep in there?
Child molesters, rapists...
...guys with death sentences, psychotics.
Hey, where are you going?
- Brad, Brad, what's wrong with you?
- It's Bradley. And I'm psychotic.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, just... just...
I'm gonna use that one.
- We're using it now, gringo.
- Don't call me a foreigner.
Last time I checked, the colors of the flag
weren't red, white, and burrito.
Want to start some stuff?
I'm more of a finisher.
- Loco en la cabeza.
- That's right. I'm loco.
Now, get the fuck out of my crazy way.
Drop the barbell!
The next shot goes into a skull!
Put your hands in the air and back away
from each other. Walk to the wall.
Maurizio? Lo mal que es? Maurizio?
Walk to the wall now!
Maurizio needs help!
What'd you do?
Thomas.
Show us 10 fingers or we'll shoot.
You just lost your minimum freedom.
You're going to 99.
Open it wide.
Close it behind us.
Make sure he doesn't trip on his chains.
You're gonna have to be more careful.
I suspect that Amnesty International
would frown upon the contents of this room.
Cell block 99 is the prison
within the prison.
You will stay down here
until you're sorted out.
Or carried out.
Stand him up.
For the next month, you'll wear this.
Turn it on.
Each time you misbehave,
you earn five points.
Each point gets you one of these.
You currently have 25 points.
These shall be dispensed to you
over the coming week.
When you are eating, when you are sleeping...
...when you are pissing,
and when you are shitting.
Mr. Thomas.
You want to be mindful of the broken glass.
Who's there?
My employer has asked me
to take a few more pictures.
Is that him?
That's the abortionist.
He is here to perform
a preliminary examination.
No.
You can't.
You can't.
This is a baby girl we're talking about.
It is lamentable...
...that she didn't have smart parents.
Christopher Bridge?
Christopher Bridge!
Who?
Christopher Bridge?
- Never heard of him.
- I'm looking for a guy named Chris Bridge.
There ain't no guy named
Christopher Bridge in here.
Never has been. Now shut up!
Are you sure about...
There. In this one.
Get up, Mr. Thomas.
Into the hall.
Look at me.
I'd prefer the stun belt.
Look at me.
Do not blink until I give you
permission to blink.
That's funny.
It's easy to hit this button.
And we got a closet full of batteries.
Look at me.
Do not blink until I give you
permission to blink.
That's good.
A few inmates requested
a little face time with you.
And I know how you like to socialize.
- Who?
- Friends of yours.
Walk down the hall.
Go slow.
If this is a surprise party...
...somebody missed the cue.
Do not kill him today.
- The warden will have my ass.
- We aren't in any hurry.
Your heroics cost me $3.2 million,
as well as my freedom...
...for an undetermined period of time...
...and because of you,
my sister is now a widow.
Her husband was Pedro
whom you shot in the back.
Let my wife go.
You and I can settle this however.
Mirame, Blanco.
A few hours ago, I received this photo.
You might like it.
I'll...
...tear...
...your head off.
Now listen to me very carefully.
If you harm me or any of my associates...
...the abortionist will sever
the limbs from your little girl.
It's a long, slow payback, Blanco.
Looks like he needs a nap.
Asshole lumberjack.
Goddamn hillbilly.
I'm sorry.
Chow time for 99!
Here you go.
This shit smells like a cab driver!
Here.
I've tasted worse.
I like your attitude.
You want to eat something?
If you don't like it,
dump it in the shithole.
Okay.
And any mess you make is one
you get to live with. I'm not a maid.
You got utensils?
Plastics or whatever?
Hey, big guy.
You feeling okay?
- A little south of okay.
- You were raving for a while.
- You have a fever?
- Did.
How come the guards are after you?
Hurt one of them.
Broke his arm.
Why are you in here?
I did some things I'm not proud of.
Where are you from? South somewhere?
- I am.
- Is it nice down there?
For most folks, it is.
I don't have a heap of
great memories from back then.
- They're helpful.
- What are?
Memories.
Keep you sane in a place like this.
I spent a lot of time
just reliving the good parts.
How long you been in here?
- Eight years.
- That's rough.
They still let you up to see visitors?
People don't want to visit me.
- How about you?
- How about me what?
Do you have people who still care
about you on the outside?
A few.
- Two that really matter.
- You have a wife?
Yeah.
She gonna wait for you?
She would have.
Wake up, Mr. Thomas.
Your buddies want to socialize.
Into the hall.
Close that.
I'd like to let the place air out.
It smells like shit and dinner.
That wasn't a suggestion.
When I autograph that cast...
...should I make it out to Mr....
...or Mrs. Bitch?
I bet your kidneys don't enjoy your jokes.
Get the gun!
- Give me the keys.
- Run!
Get help. He can't get you
with those chains on his ankles.
He will be choked out cold
by the time you get back.
Dead. It'll be on you.
Give me the keys.
- Don't give him...
- Quiet.
- Let him loose.
- Fuck no.
- Give me the keys.
- You can't get out of Redleaf.
Walk those over.
You stupid, stupid asshole.
- You killed him.
- I know what I did.
Get in.
Don't feed him. Make it so he has to
eat his friend in order to stay alive.
Warden Tuggs will kill you for this.
Him or somebody else.
Get his gun.
It's broken.
Take his stunner. It's over there.
I'm not gonna stun these guys.
Can I have it then?
I could... I could really use it in here.
Thanks. Good luck.
Johnny.
Check on Wilson.
I can go with him if you want.
Do what I say or I'll kill him.
Oh, fuck!
Kill Mr. Thomas and I'll double your wages.
Have them kick in for your funeral.
Fuck you, gringo.
Blanco.
It's especially tragic
when parents lose a child.
My condolences.
If you do not hear from me in 10
minutes, commence the abortionist.
If you have not heard
from me within the hour...
...dismantle the mother
and flush her down the toilet.
If you want your wife and child to survive...
...you better listen to me.
Call them off.
Go back to your cell or your baby's dead.
You don't have a choice.
You're wrong about that.
They will not listen to you.
That's fine. You're the one
that's gonna be making noise.
Call off your guy.
Return to your cell.
We'll do this the other way.
I will make no such phone call.
Tell me your code or it's the other leg.
7-7-7.
Howdy.
Is this that creep
that visited me at the Fridge?
I want you to hear something.
I already hurt Eleazar serious.
Right now I'm dragging him to a bunch
of guys who will fuck him bloody.
I don't want to do this, but I will.
I think you know by now I can get mean.
Brad.
- Bradley.
- Bradley.
I will tell them to release your wife.
They need to turn her over to Gil...
...so that I can confirm she's okay.
Talk correct or get raped.
Plans have changed.
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- Stay put or I'll break your neck.
Warden Tuggs?
Mr. Thomas.
- Where's Wilson?
- In my cell.
And I have two other hostages...
...Eleazar and your guy Jeremy.
Try and open that gate or gas me...
- ...I'll murder them both.
- He'll do it!
Efficiently.
Just what do you think
you're gonna accomplish here?
I'm waiting for a phone call.
One minute after I'm off,
I will turn myself over to you.
And I swear that to Jesus Christ
and heaven above.
- Wilson.
- He's not gonna answer you.
Jeremy?
Yeah?
- You okay?
- I'm not dead.
How soon before this call comes through?
Soon.
I got time for a cigar?
Half a one.
Well...
...I got a cigarillo here
that smokes pretty fast.
Release her.
Don't approach the vehicle.
Lauren?
Lauren?
What a mess.
Very disappointing.
Give me the rifle.
I always said Bradley picked a winner.
- Gil?
- I got her.
How is she?
She's good.
Thank God.
You handled everything?
- Yeah, it's done.
- Good.
- Put her on.
- Here.
Mr. Thomas. You about done?
Pretty soon.
- Bradley.
- Hey.
- Are you...
- I'm all right. What's going on there?
Don't worry about what's going on over here.
I'm fine.
I'm calling to check on you and Koala.
Make sure you're safe.
Hear your voice.
It's all just so unreal, the kidnapping
and everything that they tried to do.
I think it's over now.
Do you want to say something to the Koala?
Sure, I would.
I'd love to say something to her.
Here she is.
I wish I could be there for you
and your mother, but...
...I know you'll have a good life.
You'll grow up...
...healthy...
...and smart.
I just felt her move.
I don't know what you said.
Thank you for...
...letting me talk to her.
You're welcome.
We want to come see you.
When can we come see you?
Well, I don't know when you'll
be able to come visit here, but...
...I'll try to figure that stuff out.
- I gotta go now.
- Why? Are the guards making you hang up?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Okay.
Call when they let you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Bye.
You ready, Mr. Thomas?
I still got that one minute I told you about.
Don't.
- I'll give money to your wife.
- You won't.
What's going on in there?
- I'm executing Eleazar.
- Mr. Thomas, we're coming in.
I still have...
...25 seconds.
They say the head stays alive
for a little while...
...after it's been cut off.
I hope so.
Put your hands on your head and turn around.
78 days.
