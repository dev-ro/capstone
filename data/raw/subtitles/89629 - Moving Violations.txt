MY DOCTOR SAYS
I NEED EXERCISE,
BUT I'M SICK. "I GOT A
BAD HEART," I SAYS TO HIM.
LET ME GET
THIS TRUNK FOR YOU.
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GONNA GET
THESE BALLS OUT OF HERE.
SO ANYWAYS, HE THINKS
I'M A HYPOCHONDRIAC.
YEAH, HOW CAN I BE A HYPOCHONDRIAC
WHEN I'M SICK ALL THE TIME?
IF I DIE WHILE BOWLING,
IT'S HIS FAULT.
OH MY GOD, I'M THREE
MINUTES LATE FOR MY PILLS!
OH GOD! AM I DEAD?

HURT NOBODY.

BY HIS FELLOW MAN.

AND REMEMBER
MR. PARKINS?
THE MAN AT
THE BUTCHER'S SHOP?
HE WAS CUTTING A SLICE
OF CHUCK STEAK OR SOMETHING,
- AND HE CUT PART OF HIS FINGER OFF.
- OH, THAT'S AWFUL.
OH, AND THE GIRLS CAME
OVER LAST TUESDAY FOR BRIDGE.
- I WON 15 BUCKS!
- WOW.
- DAMN BUSES,
ALWAYS IN THE WAY!
I HATE DRIVING IN THIS AIRPORT
- TOO MUCH TRAFFIC.
HERE WE GO. COME ON, BUDDY,
LET'S MOVE IT.
SO THAT BINGO GAME,
I'M TELLING YOU!
IT WAS A WONDER...
OH, SHIT!
- HEY, ERNIE, HOW IS IT GOING?
- PRETTY GOOD.
HANK?
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
MR. CANNON.
WOW, ISN'T
THIS INCREDIBLE?
SOME HIGHER POWER MUST REALLY WANT
THE THREE OF US TO BE TOGETHER.
YOU GOT A CAR TOO.
WHY IS THAT?
YOU DON'T PARK ANY
BETTER THAN YOU DRIVE, DO YOU?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THIS CAR IS PARKED IN FRONT OF A HYDRANT.
WELL,
I CAN SEE THAT.
- NOW I WANT YOU TO MOVE THIS CAR.
- WHY?
BECAUSE YOU'RE
BREAKING THE LAW.
NO, I'M NOT.
DEPUTY MORRIS,
I THINK THIS CAR IS LOADED
WITH VIOLATIONS, DON'T YOU?
YEAH.
LIKE THIS...
BROKEN TAILLIGHT.
DEPUTY MORRIS, WHAT ABOUT
THAT MALFUNCTIONING HEADLIGHT?
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
YOU GUYS ARE NUTTY.
I'VE HAD IT
WITH YOU, PUNK.
GEE, I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.
I ALWAYS LOVED
YOU GUYS ON "CHIPS."
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, HALIK?
ON THEIR BEHALF, SIR, MAY I
SAY THAT THIS CAR WAS EVIL?
- POSSESSED OF SATAN, IT
HAD TO BE DEST- - SHUT UP!
WELL, SIR,
YOU SEE,
I ASKED HIM
TO MOVE HIS CAR-
IT'S NOT HIS CAR,
HALIK.
IT'S NOT?
IT'S MINE!
YOURS?!
I'LL SEE THE BOTH OF YOU
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
IN MY OFFICE.
UH-OH.
SOUNDS LIKE
TROUBLE, KIDS.
DON'T WORRY. DON'T LET IT
GET YOU DOWN. LIFE GOES ON.
YOU GUYS WILL BOUNCE BACK,
I CAN FEEL IT.
YOU'RE THAT KIND OF PEOPLE. LISTEN,
I'LL BE SEEING YOU KIDS AROUND.
BECAUSE YOU ARE
ALL REPEAT OFFENDERS,
HAVING RECEIVED MANY,
MANY VIOLATIONS BEFORE,
YOUR LICENSES WILL BE HELD
HERE BY THE CLERK IN SUSPENSION,
AND YOUR CARS ARE
TO BE KEPT
IN THE COUNTY IMPOUND
FACILITY.
YOUR HONOR,
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY OUR
LICENSES AND KEEPING OUR CARS?
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.
- JESUS.
- QUESTION, YOUR VICIOUSNESS.
- EXCUSE ME?
YOU'RE EXCUSED. UM, HOW
DO WE GET OUR CARS BACK?
THAT'S VERY SIMPLE. YOU ARE
ALL SENTENCED TO TRAFFIC SCHOOL.
- AFTER COMPLETING
THE COURSE,
WHICH WILL MEET FIVE NIGHTS
OVER A ONE-WEEK PERIOD,
YOU WILL RECEIVE
A CERTIFICATE OF COMPETENCY
AND YOUR VEHICLES AND LICENSES
WILL BE RETURNED.
I HIT A CASKET WITH A PUPPET
STAGE. WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO EXPLAIN, YOUR HOLINESS.
QUIET!
IF I MAY, I'D LIKE
TO APPROACH THE BENCH?
- OH, YOU WOULD, WOULD
YOU, MISTER-? - CANNON.
BUT YOU CAN
CALL ME BUTCH.
FIRST, MAY I SAY THAT BLACK IS
A TERRIFIC COLOR FOR YOU, REALLY?
ALSO, MAY I CITE THE CASE
OF ABBOT VERSUS COSTELLO?
- THE UNITED STATES VERSUS-
- SHUT UP, MR. CANNON.
NOW, FOR ALL OF YOU,
TRAFFIC SCHOOL IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO RETAIN
YOUR DRIVING PRIVILEGES.
YOUR LICENSE WILL BE REVOKED. IF
YOU CANNOT DRIVE AFTER 30 DAYS,
ALL VEHICLES HELD
IN THE COUNTY IMPOUND YARD
WILL BE SUBJECT
TO SALE AT AUCTION
WITH ALL PROCEEDS
FROM SAID SALE
GOING TO THE COUNTY.
COURT DISMISSED.
I COULDN'T HEAR
A THING. WHAT HAPPENED?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
GONNA SELL OUR CARS.
- HOW CAN THEY DO THIS?
- WHEN YOU'VE GOT BALLS, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
YOU WERE VERY GOOD
IN THERE-
"ABBOT VERSUS
COSTELLO."
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME
FORMAL LEGAL TRAINING.
YEAH, WELL, I'VE BEEN
ARRESTED IN SEVERAL STATES,
SO I GUESS I KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
- I'M DANA CANNON.
- AMY HOPKINS.
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
IN CLASS.
WHOA, IS SHE SEXY!
YEAH,
BUT WHAT ARE LOOKS?
- I MEAN, SHE'S NO ROCKET SCIENTIST.
- I FORGOT MY GLASSES.
NO, NO,
YOU GOT 'EM ON.
OH.
OH MY GOD.
THANKS.
- WELL, BYE AGAIN.
- UM, LISTEN,
I'M GONNA BE
TAKING A CAB TO THE CLASS,
SO MAYBE I COULD
PICK YOU UP OR SOMETHING?
OH NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET
SOMEBODY FROM WORK TO DROP ME OFF.
- OH, WHERE DO YOU WORK?
- NASA.
I'M A ROCKET SCIENTIST.
BYE.
HI.
DID YOU SEE
"FRIDAY THE 13th"?
NO. NO, I DIDN'T.
WHAT ABOUT THE 13th
2, 3 OR 4?
- WHAT ABOUT 5?
- MISSED THEM ALL.
IT'S TOO BAD.
THEY WERE GREAT.
A LOT OF BLOODY
GORY STUFF.
HEY, UH, DID YOU
LIKE IT MORE WHEN-
WHEN CLINT EASTWOOD GOT STUCK
HOLDING THE SEVERED ARM IN "TIGHTROPE"
OR WHEN THEY CUT THOSE
GUYS' ARMS OFF IN "SCARFACE"?
HMM, WELL,
LET'S SEE...
OH, THERE'S MY BUS,
GOTTA GO.
NICE TALKING TO YOU.
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, SETTLE DOWN.
QUIET. FIND YOUR SEATS, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
CUT THE CHATTER.
YOU TOO, RED.
SIT DOWN.
I'VE GOT ALL YOUR ALBUMS, MAN. YOU'RE
THE GREATEST. GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.
HI, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD.
FIND YOUR SEATS, PLEASE.
COME ON.
OKAY.
I'LL BE YOUR INSTRUCTOR FOR
THIS EVENING. PLEASE RISE.
COME ON- UP, UP,
UP, UP, EVERYBODY.
COME ON, COME ON,
DON'T BE AFRAID.
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
YOU IN THE BACK,
WHAT, DO YOU WANT
A SPECIAL INVITATION?
- YOU TALKING TO ME?
- YES, YOU TOO. UPPITY-UP-UP-UP.
RELAX. ENJOY.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS!
COME ON! ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY READY?
AND-
BREATHE IN.
- BLOW OUT.
BREATHE IN.
BLOW OUT.
VERY GOOD. SHAKE IT OUT.
SETTLE DOWN, SHAKE IT OUT,
SIT DOWN.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
NOW IF ALL THE LADIES WOULD BE SO
KIND AS TO TAKE OFF ALL THEIR CLOTHES,
- WE COULD GET THIS CLASS UNDERWAY.
- SIT DOWN, MR. CANNON.
COULD IT BE?
OH, NO.
IT IS!
REUNITED AT LAST!
- SIT DOWN.
- AREN'T YOU GUYS LIKE, IN THE WRONG ROOM?
SHOULDN'T YOU BE NEXT DOOR
AT THE PRO ACID RAIN RALLY?
MR. CANNON, WE'RE YOUR
TRAFFIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTORS.
- IS THIS AN INTERESTING SURPRISE OR WHAT?
- SIT DOWN,
BEFORE I MOLD YOUR FACE
INTO AN ASHTRAY.
SEE? ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS ASK NICELY.
THIS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED
IN THIS CLASSROOM.
I DEMAND
STRICT DISCIPLINE.
I JUST LOVE IT WHEN HE
GETS ANGRY LIKE THIS,
DON'T YOU?
I THOUGHT SO.
WHAT ARE THESE?
I'M A SINGLE PARENT.
BY DAY,
THEY'RE IN SCHOOL;
AT NIGHT, THERE'S NO
ONE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.
ALL RIGHT,
JUST KEEP THEM QUIET.
NOW THEN, WE WILL STUDY
THE FOLLOWING IN HERE-
TRAFFIC...
LAWS.
YOU WILL KNOW THEM
LETTER PERFECT.
YOU WILL BE TESTED
DAILY ON THEM.
YOU WILL KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT A CAR-
INSIDE AND OUT.
YOU WILL KNOW
THE RULES OF THE ROAD...
DRIVER COURTESY-
WILL THERE BE ANY LIKE,
HANDY COOKING TIPS,
LIKE, WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE
DARN HOLIDAY LEFTOVERS?
HALIK, HALIK.
NO.
OPEN YOUR DRIVING MANUALS
TO PAGE ONE.
WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM LEGAL
SPEED LIMIT IN THIS STATE?
THIS IS
A 15-MINUTE BREAK.
HEY, MAN, I THOUGHT THIS
CLASS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EASY.
WELL, IT WAS, BEFORE
ADOLPH AND EVA TOOK OVER.
THIS IS
A 15-MINUTE BREAK,
- NOT ONE SECOND MORE.
- YES, SIR.
I'LL TELL YA, THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD
BE YOUR TRANSMISSION OR YOUR FUEL PUMP,
BUT WE DO A COMPLETE
DIAGNOSTIC CHECKUP OF YOUR CAR.
- "THE CLINIC."
- YES.
- I'LL BRING MY LIMO OVER.
- ASK FOR ME.
EVERYONE CALLS ME DOC.
STOP BY THE CLINIC ANYTIME.
EXCUSE ME,
YOU HAVE A CLINIC?
NOT JUST A CLINIC,
THE CLINIC.
WE DO THE FINEST DIAGNOSTIC
CHECKUPS IN TOWN.
- DOC WILLIAMS AT YOUR SERVICE.
- I WOULD LOVE
- TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS PROBLEM I'M HAVING.
- HMM,
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?
NO MATTER WHAT I DO, I JUST
CAN'T GET GOING IN THE MORNING.
- THAT COULD BE YOUR VALVES.
- REALLY?
- HAVE YOU HAD YOUR PUMP CHECKED LATELY?
- BY A SPECIALIST.
I SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT
BECAUSE WHEN THAT GOES,
YOU DIE RIGHT ON THE SPOT.
- OH GOD, I KNOW.
- HMM.
DO YOU EVER OVERHEAT AND
STALL GOING UP STEEP HILLS?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
HAVE A MAJOR OVERHAUL,
CHECK EVERYTHING
INSIDE AND OUT.
- DO YOU LEAK MUCH?
- SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
HMM, THAT'S NO GOOD,
IS IT?
EVERY PLACE YOU GO, YOU LEAVE
THOSE UNSIGHTLY PUDDLES.
GETS SO YOUR NEIGHBORS CRINGE WHEN
THEY SEE YOU PULLING UP THEIR DRIVEWAY.
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR REAR END?
- WHAT ABOUT IT?
- DOES YOUR REAR END
MAKE NOISE?
THAT'S A BIT PERSONAL,
ISN'T IT?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I AM UP TO HERE IN MY WORK
BUT WHAT I WILL DO-
I'LL LUBE IT UP.
I'LL GET INSIDE THERE
AND ROOTAROUND
AND FIND OUT WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS.
I HAVE THE BEST TOOL IN TOWN.
TRUST ME, I'LL DO A THOROUGH JOB.
- MEANWHILE, HERE'S
WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO-
AN HOUR BEFORE YOU
GET GOING IN THE MORNING,
DRAIN OUT YOUR WATER, FLUSH
IT OUT OF THERE COMPLETELY,
TAKE IN A LOT OF OIL,
THEN GREASE UP THAT BACK END,
GET OUT ON THE HIGHWAY AND GO AS
FAST AS YOU CAN FOR NINE OR 10 MILES.
- REALLY?
- YES.
NO
- NO ONE HAS EVER SAID THIS TO ME BEFORE.
AS I SAY,
I AM A PROFESSIONAL.
I CAN LICK ANY REAR END PROBLEM
YOU CAN BRING ME.
IN FACT, I DO A LOT
OF CELEBRITIES TOO.
JUST LAST WEEK,
I REAMED OUT ROGER MOORE.
HE WAS TOTALLY SATISFIED.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HE'S COMING BACK NEXT WEEKEND
FOR A COMPLETE REAR END JOB.
OH.
BREAK'S OVER.
COME ON,
LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE.
TONIGHT.
YOU WANNA
PASS THOSE TESTS,
GET IN THERE AND DO SOME WORK. LET'S GO.
WHY DON'T WE GO
SOMEPLACE AND TALK?
UM, YEAH, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.
- IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.
- YEAH.
HEY, LOOK, I THINK WE
GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT,
AND I'M SORRY.
WHY DON'T WE SHAKE HANDS AND
WE'LL WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN?
NOW, LOOK, MISTER-
I'LL BE STRAIGHT
WITH YOU.
I HATE YOUR ASS.
- OH, COME ON, THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR.
- SHUT UP.
I'M TEACHING THIS SHITHEAD
CLASS BECAUSE YOU GOT ME DEMOTED.
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU SCREWED UP MY PROMOTION-
MY CAREER.
AND NOW I'M GONNA
SCREW THINGS UP FOR YOU.
- SOUNDS FAIR.
- YOU JUST WATCH YOURSELF.
I'LL CRUSH YOU.
OKAY, BUT JUST AS LONG
AS WE CAN STILL
BE FRIENDS, OKAY?
- MRS. HOUK?
- WHAT'S A MAN DOING IN THE LADIES' ROOM?
- THIS IS THE MEN'S ROOM.
- OH.
WHY IS MY BACK ALL WET?
BEFORE YOU GO
HOME TONIGHT,
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT A
LITTLE FILM ON TRAFFIC SAFETY ENTITLED
"BLOOD FLOWS RED
ON THE HIGHWAY."
- ALL RIGHT!
- DEPUTY MORRIS.
Every day millions
of kids happily go to school.
They look forward to another day
of learning with their friends.
Unfortunately,
some of these kids
will never make it
to their classrooms.
A thoughtless motorist who stopped
for a couple of quick drinks
for the road will cause
a senseless tragedy,
a tragedy that could have
been avoided
had he used
some common sense.
But it's too late
for that now.
- Traffic fatalities
are increasing
everywhere.
And that's why
blood flows red
on the highway.
Here we see
another accident.
Two trucks collide
with a Toyota.
Their passengers
thrown from the car-
MY DAD'S COMING BACK
ON SATURDAY,
- AND I GOTTA PICK HIM UP IN HIS CAR.
- SO WHAT?
"SO WHAT?" I DON'T
HAVE IT. IT'S IMPOUNDED,
A BRAND NEW MERCEDES.
MY DAD'S GONNA KILL ME. HE'S
GONNA OPEN EVERYTHING THAT'S CLOSED
- AND CLOSE EVERYTHING THAT'S OPEN.
- DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.
LISTEN, WE'LL GO DOWN
TO THE VIDEO STORE
AND WE'LL RENT "TEXAS
CHAINSAW MASSACRE."
THAT WILL RELAX YOU.
COME ON.
HI.
OH, UH-
BLESS YOU.
OH, SORRY.
UH-
THIS IS JO-JO.
I'M A PUPPETEER.
OH, I HAVE TO GO.
THAT'S MY SISTER.
SHE'S A SISTER.
- OH, THERE'S MY BUS. I GOTTA GO.
- NONSENSE.
TONIGHT WE'RE TRAVELING IN STYLE. TAXI!
YOU HEARD HER.
- TAXI!
- TAXI RIGHT HERE.
HO, YEAH. STEP TO THE
REAR, PLEASE. THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.
- DRIVER, TAKE US
TO THE NEAREST NUCLEAR POWER
PLANT. MY PANTS ARE FULL OF URANIUM.
NOT BAD.
AFTER I GOT MY DOCTORATE
IN PHYSICS,
I WORKED AS A STROLLING VIOLINIST IN
A HUNGARIAN RESTAURANT FOR A WHILE.
- OH, COME ON.
- NO, I REALLY DID.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED
DEGREES THAT CAN'T GET JOBS IN THEIR FIELD.
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU
FOUND YOUR FIELD.
MYSELF, I WENT TO FIVE COLLEGES,
CHANGED MAJORS
SEVEN TIMES,
AND I HAD ABOUT 10 JOBS
SINCE I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.
THAT'S QUITE
A SUCCESS STORY.
- WELL, I HAVE TO BE
AT THE LAB EARLY TOMORROW,
SO I-
- OH, I FORGOT
WHERE I PUT MY KEYS.
SPACED OUT AGAIN?
- GUESS SO.
- MAYBE.
WELL,
I GUESS I'D BETTER
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.
NOW DIDN'T THAT EASE
THE TENSION?
I'M A FOREST RANGER. I'M JUST TAKING
SOME WORK HOME FOR THE WEEKEND.
HELLO. JUST
ONE SECOND HERE.
JUST A FEW MORE
THINGS.
OKAY, NOW WE'RE
ON OUR WAY.
EXCUSE ME, I'VE BEEN DOING A
LITTLE EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
OKAY, PEOPLE, LISTEN UP. I'M
DECLARING THIS BUS A NATIONAL FOREST.
PLEASE ACT ACCORDINGLY. PLANTS
COMING THROUGH. LOOK OUT-
- HEY, HANDS OFF
THE FICUS, LADY!
DON'T GRAB THE BRANCHES. IT
COULD BE A BIRD'S HOME SOMEDAY.
HEY, IT'S NOT AN ASHTRAY.
PLANTS ARE PEOPLE TOO!
DANA, I NEEDED
THAT SHIPMENT FROM YOU.
WELL, SOME GEEKS TOOK
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE AWAY.
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
EITHER YOU BRING THAT SHIPMENT BY FRIDAY
OR YOU CAN FORGET THE WHOLE ACCOUNT.
WELL PUT.
RIGHT TO THE POINT.
AND BELIEVE YOU ME, BY THIS TIME NEXT
WEEK, WE'LL BE LAUGHING ABOUT THIS.
HA HA HA.
GREAT.
FIRST THING IN
THE MORNING, FLUSH OUT ALL THE WATER.
OKAY, I DID THAT.
THEN YOU WANNA FILL UP
WITH OIL AT LEAST TWO QUARTS.
UGH.
WELL...
HERE GOES.
NEXT, YOU WANNA
GREASE UP YOUR REAR END,
REALLY GET A LOT UP THERE.
SMEAR IT ALL AROUND.
WELL, IF IT WORKS,
IT WILL BE WORTH IT.
GET OUT ON THE HIGHWAY AND GO
AT FULL SPEED FOR ABOUT 10 MILES.
- SEE HOW IT FEELS.
- LIKE SHIT.
OFFICER HALIK, COME IN.
- SIT DOWN.
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME, YOUR HONOR?
YES, HALIK.
I HAVE A PROPOSITION
FOR YOU.
PROPOSITION?
HALIK, YOU'VE
BEEN SCREWED.
- I HAVE?
- HANK,
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE A WINNER
IN THIS TRAFFIC SCHOOL THING?
HAVE THE LAST LAUGH ON THOSE
FOOLS THAT SENT YOU DOWN?
- HOW COULD I DO THAT?
- MAKE THE CLASS TOUGH, IMPOSSIBLE.
FAIL EVERYONE.
I'LL ORDER THEIR CARS SOLD. WE'LL
GIVE HALF THE MONEY TO THE COUNTY.
- THE REST YOU SPLIT WITH ME.
- BUT WHAT IF WE GET CAUGHT?
HANK, SINCE THIS LAW
WENT INTO EFFECT,
I CONTROL THE RECORDS
OF ALL VEHICLES
ORDERED SOLD
BY THE COUNTY.
TAKE A LOOK
FOR YOURSELF.
THE LAST INSTRUCTOR
RETIRED A VERY WEALTHY MAN.
WHAT DO YOU SAY...
HANK?
¶ THERE'S A FEELING
THAT I SOMETIMES GET ¶
¶ OOH, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL ¶
¶ FOR ME TO SWING
'CAUSE I CAN'T SEE IT ¶
¶ I GO SNEAKING DOWN
THE HALLWAY ¶
¶ HIGHWAY RECOGNIZE
¶ TAKEN BY A BRAIN WAVE
¶ AND I CAN'T CONTROL
MY DRIVE ¶
¶ SOMETIMES I BREAK
THROUGH THE WALL ¶
¶ OH, I'M A MOVING VIOLATION
WHEN I MOVE ¶
¶ A MOVING VIOLATION
WHEN I MOVE, WATCH ME ¶
¶ LOSING ALL MY PATIENCE
WHEN I DO ¶
¶ WATCH ME
- ¶ MOVING VIOLATION- LATION-LATION-LATION.
¶ - GOOD PARTY, HUH?
YOU SHOULD SEE IT IN IRAN- TALK
ABOUT YOUR TOUGH TRAFFIC LAWS-
OVER THERE, YOU GET A MOVING
VIOLATION, THEY TAKE AWAY YOUR LICENSE
AND YOUR HAND. CHOP IT
RIGHT OFF AT THE WRIST.
WOW. I GOTTA GET OVER THERE TO SEE THAT.
HANK...
YOU ARE IN COMPLETE
AND TOTAL CONTROL
OF THIS CLASS.
SO FORCEFUL.
I'M NOT WEARING
ANY UNDERWEAR.
LEAVE THE CAR IN GEAR
WITH THE EMERGENCY
BRAKE ON,
AND YOU WALK TO THE REAR
OF THE CAR WITH YOUR FLARE,
BREAKING OFF
THE UPPER PORTION,
AND THROWING IT
IN THE BACK.
THEN, YOU IGNITE YOUR FLARE.
PLACING IT WITHIN SIX FEET
OF THE VEHICLE.
NOW, WE'LL LET
ONE OF YOU TRY IT.
MRS. HOUK.
HMM.
NO, MRS. HOUK,
IT'S THE OTHER ONE.
NO, DON'T THROW IT IN
THE TRUNK. OH MY GOD!
- DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
- NOT FROM WHERE I STAND.
STAND BACK
WHILE I OPEN THE HOOD.
IT'S A BIG 460
WITH A HARLEY FOUR-BARREL.
- RIGHT. SURE.
- NOW REMEMBER,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ABANDON YOUR
CAR BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
JUST LOCK IT UP AND
LEAVE IT WHERE IT STALLS.
NEVER
- I REPEAT, NEVER TRY TO PUSH IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
I'LL SHOW YOU WHY.
I NEED A VOLUNTEER.
MR. BARNES, TRY PUSHING THIS
CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
BY PUSHING THE CAR,
YOU ARE IN DANGER
OF GETTING HIT BY UH-
HANK, I NEED YOU.
THERE'S A FIRE.
- FIRE?
- FIRE.
- FIRE!
- FIRE!
- ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO. HERE WE-
COME ON! WATCH THIS.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WHO PUT ON THE BRAKE?
GET OUT OF HERE.
I'LL KILL YA!
I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU.
COME ON.
HERE COMES
THE TERMINATOR.
THANK YOU.
HAVE A NICE NIGHT.
- GOOD EVENING.
CAN I HELP YOU?
GOOD EVENING.
CAN I HELP YOU?
CAN I HELP YOU?
GOOD EVENING.
CAN I HELP YOU?
- HI.

UH-
ARE YOU DOING
ANYTHING LATER?
- YEAH, I'M GOING OUT.

BUT YOU COULD COME
WITH ME.
HOW ABOUT WE MEET
AT THE BAND BOX?
- ON TOWER? HOW ABOUT 10:00?
- SURE.
- OKAY.
- OKAY.
GREAT, OKAY.
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- RIGHT.
BYE-BYE.
SCOTT, YOU DEVIL.
- SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
- REALLY?
NO.
I GOT MY DOUBTS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DON'T PUT YOURSELF DOWN.
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.
GO GET HER.
- TRUST ME.
- THANKS, DANA.
YOU'RE A PRETTY GREAT GUY
YOURSELF, DANA.
SPEAKING
OF GREAT GUYS-
GOOD EVENING, KIDS.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M DOING A LOT BETTER
THAN YOU, MR. CANNON.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR BUSINESS
IS GOING DOWN THE DRAIN.
TOO BAD.
YEAH, WELL
- I CAN ALWAYS GET ANOTHER JOB.
YOU ON THE OTHER HAND,
CIVIL SERVANT,
ARE STUCK IN THIS SHITTY NOWHERE
TRAFFIC SCHOOL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
FOREVER.
I AM SICK OF YOU,
MR. CANNON.
FINE. WHY DON'T YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?
I'M OFF-DUTY.
WHY DON'T WE JUST STEP RIGHT
OVER HERE AND SETTLE THIS?
FINE, RIGHT NOW.
DANA, WHY DID YOU GET HIM
GOING? HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
YEAH, I MIGHT'VE
GONE TOO FAR.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- LET'S FIND OUT.
- OVER HERE, CANNON.
- OH, EXCELLENT CHOICE.
SO, WHAT'S GONNA BE?
BOXING?
KARATE?
WRESTLING?
- ARE YOU KIDDING? LOOK,
WIMP- - OH, JESUS.
YOU COME ON LIKE
THIS BIG MACHO STRONGMAN.
HOW ABOUT
A REAL TEST OF STRENGTH?
HOW ABOUT ARM WRESTLING?
SOUNDS GREAT.
I BETTER WARN YOU, CANNON,
I HAPPEN TO BE WESTERN
DIVISION ARM WRESTLING CHAMPION,
SO DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN
I BREAK YOUR ARM IN TWO.
SOUNDS FUN.
COME ON, DICKHEAD.
SPENCE,

OKAY, ON THREE.
ONE, TWO-

WHOOPSY.
SCOTT, SCOTT.
STEPHANIE... HI.
HI.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?
- THIS IS MY HAIR?
I JUST WEAR
A WIG A LOT.
IT LOOKS TERRIFIC-
REALLY, TERRIFIC.
HEY, DO YOU LIKE CARS
AS MUCH AS I DO?
SURE,
PROBABLY MORE.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I LOVE TO DO?
I LOVE TO DRIVE FAST.
UH, I DON'T
HAVE A LICENSE.
WE COULD GET
INTO BIG TROUBLE.
SCOTT,
WHEN I DRIVE FAST,
I GET VERY HOT-
SO VERY, VERY HOT.
LET'S GO.
¶ ONE FOOT ON THE BRAKE
¶ AND ONE ON THE GAS,
HEY! ¶
FASTER, SCOTT.
¶ WELL, THERE'S
TOO MUCH TRAFFIC ¶
¶ I CAN'T PASS, NO... ¶
FASTER, SCOTT,
IT TURNS ME ON.
¶ SO I TRY MY BEST
ILLEGAL MOVE ¶
¶ A BIG
BLACK AND WHITE... ¶
GO ALL THE WAY, SCOTT!
FLOOR IT, FLOOR IT!
GO FASTER, SCOTT!
¶ GO ON AND WRITE ME UP
FOR 125 ¶
- ¶ POST MY FACE,
WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE... ¶
WHOA, WHOA-OA!
STOP HERE!
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.
I GOTTA GO.
HEY, UH-
YOU FORGOT YOUR KEYS.
IT'S NOT MY CAR.
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE CAR IT IS.
OH, SHIT!
- WELCOME TO NASA.
- GREAT.
- SO THIS IS WHERE YOU WORK?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I GREW UP IN A PLACE
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE THIS.
NOW, DANA, DON'T FOOL AROUND IN HERE.
- THIS IS A SERIOUS PLACE.
- THANKS, DR. HOPKINS.
SO THESE ARE THE READOUTS
FOR ALL THE SPACE PROBES
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ORBITING.
THAT'S THE VOYAGER PROJECT.
THAT'S VIKING,
THAT'S PIONEER,
AND THAT'S
THE RUSSIAN'S LUNAKHOD.
OH, THE BAD GUYS, HUH?
WE'LL GET THEM.
DON'T MIND ME, FELLAS. YOU GUYS
ARE DOING A TERRIFIC JOB, REALLY.
- KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
ENJOY, ENJOY.
HMM.
YOU ARE REALLY
AN AGGRESSIVE WOMAN.
- COME ON.
- OH, MY FAVORITE TWO WORDS.
- SO I HAVE
A QUESTION.
- WHY ARE WE HERE?
- BECAUSE...
OF THIS.
THIS?
COULD BE DIFFERENT.
UP, UP AND AWAY.
WHOA, YEAH, NOW I KNOW
HOW A RACQUETBALL FEELS.
YEAH! YEEHAW!
TOO MUCH FUN. THIS IS A GOOD WAY
TO KEEP YOUR SOCKS UP, YOU KNOW?
¶ I FEEL NICE
¶ SUGAR AND SPICE NOW...
COME HERE, DANA.
DANA, COME HERE NOW.
THIS FEELS GREAT.
NOW WHAT?
WELL, I ALWAYS SAY,
"IF YOU MAKE LOVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
MAKE IT INTERESTING."
I'M FOR THAT.
TONIGHT,
WE GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR
AND TEST YOU ON THE FUNDAMENTALS
- OF DRIVING.
- FIRST GROUP, HOUK, CANNON,
BARNES, ROTH,
AND HOPKINS.
MRS. HOUK,
YOU DRIVE.
WHERE'S THE CAR?
OH, GOD, WE'RE DEAD.
RIGHT THIS WAY, MRS. HOUK.
- DAD, ARE WE THERE YET? I'M HUNGRY.
- SHUT UP!
TAKE A RIGHT HERE, MRS. HOUK.
- STOP THE CAR,
MRS. HOUK.
- I HEAR BELLS.
- MRS. HOUK!
YOU HEAR BELLS?
SHIT, HIT THE BRAKE!
THE TRAIN IS COMING!
START THE CAR,
MRS. HOUK.
YOU KNOW WHAT A TRAIN DOES
WHEN IT HITS THE BODY?
START THIS CAR!
- EVERYBODY GET OUT OF THE CAR!
- GET OUT, GET OUT.
MRS. HOUK!
GET OUT!
GET OUT OF THE CAR!
- WHERE IS EVERYONE?
- DAMN, IT'S LOCKED!
COME ON, COME ON,
WE GOTTA PUSH.
- WOULD YOU GET OVER HERE AND PUSH?
- OH, MAN.
OH, WE'RE GONNA
BE SPLATTERED!
HONEY, ARE YOU
OKAY? GOD, THAT SCARED ME!
OH-HO-HO-HO.
HO!
IT'S LIKE
I ALWAYS SAY,
"WHEN THE GOING
GETS TOUGH,
THE TOUGH GET GOING
IN THEIR PANTS."
GO AHEAD AND LAUGH. NONE OF YOU ARE
GONNA FINISH TRAFFIC SCHOOL ANYWAY.
YOU'RE GONNA ALL FAIL.
AND I GUARANTEE YOU
NONE OF YOU WILL EVER
SEE YOUR CARS AGAIN.
JEEZ.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO? MY
DAD IS GONNA KILL ME.
WITH THE DEBTS I'VE GOT, DYING
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
HEY, WOULD YOU TWO BURLY
FELLAS CARE TO JOIN ME
IN A DESPERATE MISSION
A LITTLE BIT LATER?
SURE. WILL THERE BE BLOODSHED?
SHH.
HEY, GUYS, IT'S ME.
HEY, MAN, YOU ALMOST
GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.
GREAT!
WINK, DO ME A FAVOR
- TRY TO BE AN ACTUAL PERSON IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES, OKAY?
- THIS AIN'T GONNA BE EASY.
- RELAX,
I GOT IT COVERED.
I MADE THIS STUFF
AT HOME.
WORKS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?
VERY NICE,
VERY NICE.
UM, TIME TO GET GOING,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?
THERE WE GO.
UH-OH.
I'LL SAVE YOU,
HERE I COME.
YEEHAW!
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUR CARS.
- IS THAT YOUR TRUCK?
- NO.
LET'S TRY DOWN HERE.
SHIT.
- WHO IS IT?
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT IS.
IT'S THAT PAIN IN THE BUTT,
DANA CANNON.
- I CAN'T FIND MY LIMO.
- HALIK!
CHRIST.
FIERCE, THIS IS
JUST LIKE "CUJO," MAN.
- COME ON, COME GET US!
- THERE'S MY TRUCK.
OH, TEAR YOUR HEART OUT.
SO LONG.
- I'LL HAVE CANNON PICKED UP WITHIN THE HOUR.
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
I'LL REALLY
TAKE CARE OF HIM.
HEY, COME BACK HERE.
WE JUST STOLE THAT THING OURSELVES.
SHIT.
DANA CANNON,
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE NOW.
ALL RIGHT, ALL THE MONEY
IN THE TILL, COME ON!
MOVE IT!
WHAT?
YEAH?
- FREEZE, MISTER.
- IF THIS IS ABOUT THE RENT,
THE CHECK'S IN THE MAIL,
I SWEAR TO GOD.
- IS THAT YOUR TRUCK?
- YEAH.
- WHERE DID YOU FIND IT? GREAT.
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
BECAUSE THIS WAS AN ARMED ROBBERY
AND THE DEFENDANT HAS
APPEARED BEFORE ME PREVIOUSLY-
- YOUR HONOR, I WAS FRAMED.
- QUIET!
I'M GOING TO SET BAIL
AT $10,000.
- GREAT. DO YOU TAKE VISA?
- THE COURT IS IN RECESS.
WAS I STRICT ENOUGH?
OH, YES,
VERY.
HANK, I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
I'VE COMPUTED OUR TAKE
FROM THE SALE OF THE CARS.
IT COMES TO OVER
$50,000.
NEDRA...
YOU'VE CHANGED
MY WHOLE LIFE.
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME A WHOLE NEW
WAY OF LOOKING AT THE LAW.
WELL, LET'S GO OVER
TO YOUR PLACE.
I'LL SHOW YOU A WHOLE NEW
WAY OF LOOKING AT MY BODY.
OH, I HOPE THIS IS
THE RIGHT PLACE.
OH, YES,
THE CLINIC.
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH DOC WILLIAMS.
AH, JOAN, RIGHT ON
TIME. I LOVE PUNCTUALITY.
WHY DON'T YOU COME THIS WAY? I
AM A LITTLE HARRIED RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU, WHY DON'T
YOU WAIT IN MY OFFICE?
I THINK YOU'LL BE A BIT
MORE COMFORTABLE IN HERE.
OKAY.
AND WE'LL GET TO THAT EXAMINATION
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
I AM DYING TO GET
AT YOUR REAR END.
SHE'S READY TO GO, MR. KOLONAWSKI,
AND PURRING LIKE A KITTEN.
AND I'LL SEE YOU
BACK HERE IN 6,000 MILES,
NOT A MILE OVER.
- CARL, WANT TO
BACK IT OUT FOR MR. K?
OKAY, JOAN, I'M
READY FOR YOU NOW.
ALL RIGHT, DOC.
- LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT IT, SHALL WE?
- HMM.
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.
DOC, SHOULDN'T I
BE WEARING A GOWN?
NO, DON'T BE SILLY, WE'RE
NOT THAT FORMAL AROUND HERE.
WHAT THE HECK?
ALL RIGHT, JOAN-
EXCUSE ME.
HELLO, THE CLINIC.
YES, MR. ARMISTEAD.
YES, SIR, COULD YOU HOLD
A SECOND, PLEASE?
UH, JOAN, WHY DON'T YOU
GET IT UP ON THAT RACK
AND GIVE ME A HOLLER
AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY?
YES, MR. ARMISTEAD.
I SEE. WELL, THAT'S THE SAME PROBLEM
- WE HAD IN THE PAST,
ISN'T IT, SIR?
IS THERE
A CONSTANT VIBRATION?
GOD, THERE'S SO
MANY DOCTORS IN HERE!
WHAT'S THIS?
"GAS ANALYSIS"?
- GOSH!
- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS BRING IT IN
- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND LET'S RECHECK IT.
NO, I WANT YOU TO BRING
IT IN IMMEDIATELY, SIR.
LET'S NIP THIS IN THE
BUD. THAT'S MY MOTTO.
HOW DOES
YOUR WEEK LOOK?
- THURSDAY'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY-
- AT 2:30 P.M.?
- ALL RIGHT, DOC, I'M READY.
ROGER?
YOU CAN?
FINE. I'LL SEE YOU AT 2:30-
ON FRIDAY.
SO LONG, MR. ARMISTEAD.
AH, WILL YOU TWO GUYS PLEASE
CHECK OUT THAT REAR END?
OKAY, SO NOW WHAT?
HEY, KIDS.
LOOK AT THIS.
HEY, COME ON, COME ON, COME
ON. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
IT'S JUST A FAKE...
OH NO, IT'S NOT.
WINK, WOULD YOU
LEAVE MY KIDS ALONE?
OKAY, NOW THEN,
FOR FIVE POINTS,
TRUE OR FALSE?
YOU MAY MAKE A U-TURN
IN-BETWEEN INTERSECTIONS
OF A BUSINESS DISTRICT.
- FALSE.
- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS.
NOW-
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU KIDS?
YEAH, NICE ACCESSORIES-
MATCHING, NO LESS!
HOW MTV OF YOU KIDS.
SO THIS IS SERIOUS
KINDA, HUH?
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR WE
HAVE TO STUDY THIS HARD.
YOU THINK IT WAS FAIR I
GREASED UP MY ASS EVERY DAY
AND YOU HAD MANNY, MOE
AND JACK LOOKING UP IT?
YOU FEEL BETTER,
DON'T YOU?
WHY DO I FIND
ALL THIS INTRIGUING?
- DANA, WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR HOURS.
- YEAH, WE CAN PASS THAT TEST.
LOOK, I LOST
A $20,000 ACCOUNT.
I'M FACING
10 TO 20 YEARS
ON A MAJOR FELONY. IF I'M
GONNA HEAD UP THE RIVER,
I WANNA DRIVE MYSELF
UP THE RIVER, ALL RIGHT?
YOU WITH ME?
- All: YEAH.
- OKAY, I KNEW I COULD TALK YOU INTO IT.
NOW THEN, WHEN ENTERING
AN INTERSECTION...
WILLIAMS, PASS.
ROTH, PASS.
McCARTY, PASS.
HOPKINS, PASS.
POPADOPHALOS, PASS.
CANNON...
- PASS.
- ALL RIGHT!
- WE ALL MADE IT!
- HEY!
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.
THE BAD NEWS IS,
THESE WRITTEN TESTS
COUNT ONLY 5%
OF YOUR GRADES.
WHAT? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
YOU MEAN WE HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER TEST
BEFORE WE CAN GET OUR CERTIFICATE?
THAT'S RIGHT, MS. HOPKINS.
SO IF YOU'LL ALL FOLLOW ME
INTO THE PARKING LOT,
WE'LL HAVE
YOUR DRIVING SKILL TESTS.
HEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, BABY?
WHY SO COLD?
NOTHING.
OH, COME ON, IS HE KIDDING?!
IS THIS AMUSING OR WHAT?
THE OBJECTIVE
OF THIS TEST IS TO STAY
WITHIN
THE WHITE PAINTED LINES
REGARDLESS OF THE OBSTACLES
IN YOUR PATH
OR THE CONDITIONS OF THE ROAD.
LET'S BEGIN WITH MR. GREEBER.
GO GET 'EM, SCOTTY.
- DO IT, SCOTTY.
- ALL RIGHT, GREEBER.
THAT SON OF A BITCH.
- IT'S A MESS.
- HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.
NONE OF THEM WILL.
SO, HOW DID I DO?
- DIDN'T DO SO HOT.
- HOW ABOUT WE ALL FAIL?
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE NEVER
GONNA DRIVE AGAIN.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S IT.
MY DAD'S COMING
BACK IN TOWN TOMORROW.
- I'M DEAD.
- TOO BAD, TOUGH BREAK.
IF I WERE YOU, I'D GET USED
TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
I'M IN THE CAR
BUSINESS AND I CAN'T DRIVE.
WE'RE SCREWED.
WE GOT SHAFTED.
- MY DAD IS GONNA KILL ME.
- NOT IF WE GET TO HIM FIRST.
LET'S FACE IT, WE'RE
NEVER GONNA DRIVE AGAIN.
WAIT A MINUTE HERE. I CAN'T
BELIEVE I'M HEARING THIS.
YOU THINK WE'RE FINISHED,
WASHED UP, HISTORY?
WELL, I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER.
LOOK AT MICHAEL JACKSON-
HIS HAIR CAUGHT ON FIRE.
DID HE GIVE UP?
NO.
HE CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
AND WENT ON A "VICTORY" TOUR.
ALL RIGHT. NOW INSTEAD
OF PISSING AND MOANING
ABOUT HOW BAD OFF WE ARE,
LET'S ZERO IN
ON THE GUY
WHO MADE SURE
WE'D NEVER DRIVE AGAIN.
LET'S GET THE GUY
WHO SCREWED US.
- LET'S GET HALIK.
- YEAH, FUCK HIM!
RIP HIS NUTS OFF!
ALL RIGHT, I THINK SHE HAD
ENOUGH TO DRINK. BUT SHE'S RIGHT.
LET'S GET SOME BEERS.
LET'S GO GET HIM!
COME ON!
RIGHT NOW!
NOW THIS I LIKE.
FIRST WE KILL HIM,
- THEN CUT HIS FACE OFF.
- WINK, YOU'RE A SICK MAN,
- TRUST ME ON THAT.
- OH, COME ON.
DOC, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?
COME ON, RIDE ME, DADDY.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
YOUR HONOR.
OH, MAN!
THIS HAS TOTALLY RUINED SEX
FOR ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
- DOC, YOU GOT THE TOOLS?
- RIGHT HERE.
LET'S GO.
- DID YOU SEE ANYBODY?
- I DON'T KNOW.
GOOD.
MOVE OVER, BUDDY.
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE
I WANT, RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S IT. YEAH,
GIVE THAT ANOTHER TURN.
- WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
- I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
NOW GET BACK TO WORK.
DO YOU LIKE IT?
- YEAH.
- I'M GLAD.
COME TO BED, HONEY.
- STEPHANIE?
- OH NO, MY FATHER!
I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM HOME
SO SOON.
- YOUR FATHER?
- YEAH. IF HE FINDS YOU IN BED WITH ME,
HE'LL KILL YOU.
I'M ONLY 15.
HURRY UP!
MY FATHER WILL KILL YOU.
HE'S AN ANIMAL.
HE'S A TEAMSTER.
HOW COULD YOU BE 15? YOU'VE
GOT A DRIVER'S LICENSE.
FAKE I.D.
- I'VE BEEN DRIVING SINCE I'VE BEEN 12.
WHERE'S DADDY'S GIRL?
IN YOUR ROOM?
- STEPHIE-
- HI, DADDY.
- WHO THE-
- I DIDN'T KNOW SHE-
YOU?
I WILL KILL YOU!
OH, GOD. OH, GEE.
OH, GOD. OH MY GOD!
- OH GOD.
- YOU'RE DEAD!
SCOTT, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
THAT'S IT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- ARE YOU GONNA BE A GOOD BOY?
- YES, MOMMY. YES.
WHAT THE-
MOVE, MOVE.
- THIS OUGHT TO BE GOOD.
STAY TUNED.
COME ON.
BASTARD!
SEE THAT LEDGER
ON THE NIGHTSTAND?
- UH, YEAH.
- COME HERE.
THEY WERE GONNA SELL YOUR
CARS AND SPLIT THE MONEY.
WHIP ME TILL IT HURTS. I KNEW
SOMETHING WEIRD WAS GOING ON.
- YES, MOMMY!
- THAT LEDGER TELLS EVERYTHING.
NOW GET IT TO CHIEF ROWE DOWN AT
CITY HALL AND HE'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM.
WELL, THANKS. YOU KNOW, I
HAVE A SENSE ABOUT PEOPLE,
AND I FELT ALL ALONG THAT
YOU WERE DECENT AND KIND.
SHOVE IT, DIPSHIT.
AND MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU TOO, SANTA.
CAN'T GO THIS WAY.
LET'S GO.
COME ON,
LET'S GO.
NO, SIT, NO!
- THIS IS THE ONLY ONE OPEN.
- YEAH, BUT WHO COULD FIT IN HERE?
OH, YEAH.
OH, HONEY, YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.
I JUST HOPE
HOUK'S ON THE PILL.
OH, YES!
SHE'S GOT IT.
LET'S GO.
YEAH. OH, PRESS IT.
- WHO THE HELL WAS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT SHE'S GOT THE LEDGER.
YOU BASTARD.
- NOW, SUGAR-
- DON'T SUGAR ME.
DANA CANNON'S ON HIS WAY
TO CHIEF ROWE
TO TELL HIM ABOUT YOUR

AND JUDGE HENDERSON'S PLAN
TO BILK THE CITIZENS
AND THE CITY

THE HOLD-UP MAN WORE. - WHAT?!
I REMEMBER
THE INSIGNIA.
- I'M POSITIVE. THIS IS THE MAN.

I THINK SO. I'M MOVING IN WITH YOU.
OH, YOU ARE?
THAT'S RIGHT. SO WHY
DON'T YOU JUST FOLLOW ME
IN YOUR TRUCK TO MY PLACE
SO WE CAN PICK UP MY THINGS?
SO MAYBE WE COULD STOP
AT THE SPACE LAB
AND GO FOR A LITTLE TWIRL?
ALL RIGHT, EMMA JEAN,
LET'S GET GOING.
- LET ME DRIVE, LORETTA.
- WHY SHOULD I LET YOU DRIVE?
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE A THING.
- DON'T BE SILLY,
I CAN SEE
AS WELL AS YOU CAN.
