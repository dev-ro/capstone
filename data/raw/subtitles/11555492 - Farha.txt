O fig pickers
Let the figs be on the tree
Pick them and fail to eat them
And you will have to deal with me
NOVEL - SHAIMA HASSAN
-We're late. The sheikh will punish us.
-Let's go.
Farha.
-Let's go.
-Hurry up.
-Come on.
-Hurry!
Come on, Farha.
-Come on.
-Faster!
FARHA
PALESTINE, 1948
"It doesn't matter
if you don't support him, for Allah did
when the disbelievers drove him out
and he was only one of two
while they both were in the cave,
he reassured his companion, don't worry--
"He reassured his companion,
'Don't worry'."
"He reassured his companion,
Don't worry; Allah is certainly with us.'"
"So Allah sent down His serenity
upon the Prophet,
and supported him with forces
you did not see.
-"And made those…"
-"And made the word…"
"And made the word of the disbelievers…
of the disbelievers…
lowest…
lowest,
while the Word of Allah is supreme."
"And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise."
"True are the words
of Allah the Almighty."
I'm dismissing you early today, girls.
As you know,
tomorrow is Suad's bridal shower.
I wish you all the same thing.
I wish we will have a school for girls
in the village, just like the boys.
You may leave.
-How are you, sweetie?
-I'm well.
Send my regards to the mayor.
I'll see him later.
Go on, child.
-Don't go far from the house.
-Okay.
I still can't believe you're here.
-Me neither. I wish I lived here.
How could someone living the city
wish to live here?
What's in the village? A couple of sheep?
It has trees, birds…
And you.
Listen.
You can't move here
when I get lucky and move to the city.
I will kill you. I'm serious.
Imagine that I'd go to the city,
and go to school.
I'd have a backpack, workbooks, pens…
We'd go to school together by car.
Speaking of which,
what did your dad decide?
I don't know yet. I'll know today.
-Aren't those the British soldiers?
-It looks like it.
Come on! Get out of here!
-What's "get out of here" in English?
-I don't know. Maybe "goodbye."
What?
Look at what you did!
Even when you are leaving?
-Get out of here! Leave!
-Leave!
-Leave and never come back.
-Leave!
-Wait for me!
-Leave!
-Wait for me!
-Leave!
Wait for me!
I hit the British soldier.
What weapons and what armed men?
You speak as if we have
a fully equipped army
with cannons, tanks, and planes.
We just have a handful of rusty guns
and defective bullets,
some of which are even filled with wax.
Welcome, Farha.
What a beauty!
I wouldn't have recognized you
in the street.
How are you, Uncle?
All better now that I've seen you.
See? Farha has grown
and it's time to marry her off.
Come on, man!
She's still too young to get married.
Dad, I want to remind you.
Next week is the deadline
for enrolling at school.
I told you now is not the time.
Serve your uncle.
Thank you.
Thank you. Put it down, sweetie.
I'll drink in a bit.
Anyway, when you think of it,
the military power of the…
-May you always have a welcoming home.
-Thank you, Abu Al Waleed.
Sameeha?
-Sameeha? I'm calling you.
-Coming!
Hurry up and go with your brother
before the dark.
Come on, sister. Hurry up.
We did not show you
proper hospitality yet, Abu Al Waleed.
Don't say that, Abu Farha.
Always so generous and welcoming.
-Thank you.
-I don't like anyone else's company.
But you know how things are.
Mother is sick.
We want to get back to her quickly
and the roads are not safe.
We want to get there before dark.
I wish your mother a speedy recovery.
And visit more often.
Once every two months is not enough.
God willing.
And listen,
take it easy on your daughter.
What is the problem if she wants to learn?
There is no harm in that.
Is she asking for the impossible?
Knowledge in youth is wisdom in age.
Abu Al Waleed.
Do you want me to go against the norms?
Let me find her a suitor
who will take care of her in these times.
You're the only one who encourages her.
She's already stubborn as it is.
Listen. The paper I got you includes
the enrollment form to the city school.
-What are you saying, man?
-Hear me out.
Think about it, but not for long.
The enrollment period is limited.
I'll take care of her in the city
as if she was my daughter.
That's Farha. She's reliable.
So come on, say yes.
-Hello, sister.
-I'm ready, brother.
-Give me your bindle.
-You're my cousin,
and I cherish you and respect
your words. You know that.
-God bless you.
-I'll think about it.
God willing.
-Take care of yourself and of Farha.
-Where is Farha? Farha?
Where are you, Farha?
Come here, dear.
-I'll come back soon.
-Hey.
Take care of your father, okay?
Everything will be okay.
Okay then. Take care.
-Peace be with you.
-Go with the protection of God.
I'll be back soon.
-Next time, we will play backgammon.
-You seem to like losing.
-All right. See you later.
-Godspeed.
-Be safe.
-Take care on the road.
We will.
-That's your place. You honor us.
-Thank you.
Anyway, I need your advice too.
Farha is smart and loves to learn.
I'm thinking about sending her
to the city…
-No, Abu Farha.
-…to learn,
because I don't want to disappoint her.
You taught her and know her
as well as I do, if not better.
Mayor!
We've talked about this. Your daughter
should stay with you in these times.
Keep your daughter with you.
-The situation is volatile.
-I hear you.
And what learning are you talking about?
She learned the Quran.
What else is there to learn?
Geography, history, math, and English.
Farha!
How come she's so stubborn?
Who is it?
Open the door, Farha. It's Nasser.
-Yes?
-How are you, Farha?
I'm good.
Here. Mom sent this casserole,
until your stepmom comes back.
-Okay.
-Wait.
So you know nothing about cooking?
No, I don't.
I can't see.
I can't see anything.
O beautiful bride, beautiful like the moon
-Did you have fun?
-A lot of fun.
O Suad, prettiest of them all
Mohammad you shall wed
Isn't that Nasser?
Yes. Let's go.
What were you talking about
with my uncle and his son?
Dad.
Dad!
-Abu Fahad?
-Hello, mayor.
-How is it going?
-God bless you.
What were you talking about
with my uncle and his son?
You mean your cousin.
Here you go.
What's wrong with your cousin Nasser?
What's wrong with him?
And why won't you marry
like the rest of the girls in the village?
I don't want to get married.
What are you saying?
You need to be disciplined
for saying that.
Don't move, girl!
Shame on you!
Is that a way to talk to your father?
Your father who raised you
and now brought you the enrollment form
so you can complete your studies
in the city.
For real, Dad?
Are you serious?
Listen…
-Farha is going to the city school
-Girl!
-Fareeda, get the party started
-Don't make a scene. Get down.
Get down.
And the mayor is the best father
in whole the village
What should I do with this girl?
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
Technically, in the middle regions
and in the South,
there are no Palestinian villages left.
All villagers have been displaced.
They are now refugees in other regions.
So, ever since someone from my family,
the Jalmood family, was elected mayor,
all that mattered to us
is preserving the village,
and the safety of its inhabitants.
So, is that your final decision, mayor?
You heard me.
Now, you had your tea and coffee,
and we respect you tremendously.
Come on, guys. We have no time to lose.
Abu Nemr, listen to me.
I received promises,
and I heard
that the Arab forces will support us
by sending ammunition and soldiers.
We better wait.
When we receive the support,
I will be at the forefront of the army.
I will be the first to fight.
This is not a truce.
They are stalling for time.
-In the end, your land will turn to ash.
-Listen, Son.
I did not expect that you will
refuse to help us. Goodbye.
I hope that your forces
will arrive fast, Abu Farha.
FARHA KAMEL JALMOOD
GRADE SIX
Dad?
Dad?
Farha? Why are you awake so early?
Dad, what are you doing?
I am plastering the cracks.
Plaster glues the stones together.
Don't you want to sleep?
I forgot to tell you. Dad said yes.
-Really? Is it confirmed?
-Yes.
I can't believe it.
-Is there something upsetting you?
-No, nothing.
You don't look happy.
Of course I'm happy.
But I'm thinking of my father.
I can't leave him.
That's all.
But he's not alone.
-I know why you're upset.
-Why?
-You lost the suitor.
-I'm warning you!
Enough!
Enough! No, stop! I will shut up.
But don't worry. He'll wait for you.
-Fareeda!
-No, fine. I'll stop. Cut it out.
Do you know what I've decided?
When I finish my studies in the city,
I want to become a teacher.
I will open a school here,
just for girls.
When I grow up, I want to become…
Save your women and children
from the blood pool
while you still can.
Oh, God!!
-Go! Get out of here!
-God, spare your people!
Come on, run!
Head to the northern exit of the village
while it is still open.
-Are you hurt?
-No.
Where were you? Let's get out of here.
Allah is Sufficient!
Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust!
Fareeda! Are you okay, Fareeda?
-Let's go. There is no time. Hurry.
-Fareeda!
-Come on. Get in the car.
-Where is Dad?
-Hurry up, Hassan. Take!
-To Khallat Taweel.
-Have you seen my dad?
-We'll look for him. Get in, Farha.
Get in. Where are you going?
Where are you going, child?
Where to? Masoud?
I entrust you with my daughter, Masoud.
-Take her in the car.
-You heard your dad.
-Leave this place. Go!
-No, Dad.
-Dad, where will you go?
-Get in the car. Leave!
Are you okay, Farha?
-Where are they getting in from?
-They surrounded us from all sides.
The northern exit is the only one left.
Head North.
Go to Khallat Taweel. I will follow you.
I won't leave you here.
I'll get them to safety
and meet the mayors
to see what I can do,
then I will come back.
Kamel!
-Watch out!
-Calm down.
-Uncle! Stop!
-There is no time, Farha.
-Stop!
-Wait!
-Farha!
-Farha, wait!
-I have to stay with my dad.
-Farha!
-Oh, God!!
-Take the women.
Farha!
-Fareeda?
-Farha!
-Come here! Where are you going? Get in.
-Farha!
Farha!
Why did you come back?
-Dad?
-Farha.
-Dad, what is this?
-The village has fallen.
-Where will we go?
-Oh, God!!
What will we do now, Dad?
What are you doing, Dad?
Will we go to Fareeda's?
Fareeda? I told you to go
with Masoud and you refused.
Come on.
Dad, will we go to the city?
-Nasser!
-Get out!
Where will we go now?
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?
Come with me.
Dad, where will we go?
There is no time to eat, Dad.
We have to leave.
-We have to catch up with them.
-Get in and wait for me.
-No!
-I will come back to get you.
-Do you understand?
-Let me stay with you.
-Stay with me where?
-Dad, I want to stay with you.
-Stay with me where?
-Dad!
-I won't say it again. Listen to me.
-No, Dad!
-Come on. Hurry up. Let's go.
-Dad, I want to stay with you.
I will come back to get you.
Don't be scared. There is no time.
-Listen to me.
-Dad…
-This is the safest place for you.
-Then stay with me.
Stay with you where?
I have to be with the people.
The soldiers entered the village.
Do you get it?
-No, Dad.
-Calm down.
Listen. Wait for me here
and I will come back to get you.
Don't be scared. I won't be long.
Keep this.
Did you hear me, child?
-Dad!
-I won't leave you.
Dad, stay with me.
Farha…
I will be back, child.
Stay inside.
Don't be scared.
Dad?
Dad?
TO MY DEAR FRIEND FARHA
FROM FAREEDA
Dad?
Get out of here!
Get out! Come on. Out!
Take the boy and leave.
I said take the boy and go.
Farha is going to the city school
Fareeda, get the party started
Oh joy
Come this way.
This is a good place. Come.
-Lower your voice.
-The pain is too much.
Sit here.
Give her some water. It's okay.
Pray. Come on.
Oh, God.
Slowly. Come on.
Lower your voice.
The head is out. It's okay. A little more.
A little more.
A little more.
He's out.
A boy. It's Mohammed.
Congratulations, Abu Mohammed.
Congratulations!
Give me a stone.
Allah is the greatest.
I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah.
I bear witness that
Muhammad is His Messenger.
Come to prayer. Come to prosperity.
Allah is the greatest.
There is no god but Allah.
Take your brother, child.
Abu Mohammed?
Abu Mohammed?
I'm here.
Who are you? What are you doing here?
My dad left me here.
He said he'll be back,
but he hasn't returned.
I'm worried about him.
Get me out of here. The door is there.
All right. Okay.
Stand back.
Leave your houses.
Lower your voice. Don't make a sound.
Those who do not leave now
will be killed in their houses.
Where are you, Abu Mohammed?
Don't make any noise. Hide the girls.
Get out with your children and women now.
Go and hide on the roof.
Hurry up. To the roof.
Get out or get killed.
Get out or get killed in your houses.
Don't move. I'm talking to you.
Come here.
Come here.
Hands up.
-What is this?
-These are my papers?
-There is nothing there.
-Turn around.
Turn around!
Do you know him?
No. He's from another village.
He's not a fighter.
Shut up!
Sir, he came out through that door.
Okay.
-Search the house.
-Yes, sir.
You. Walk.
-There is nothing here.
-Come on.
-I'm telling you there is nothing here.
-Come on.
-I'm just passing by.
-Move.
I'm telling you, I'm just passing by.
-Come on. Move!
-I don't live here. I'm just passing by.
I stopped to drink water.
Move. Come on.
-There is no one here.
-Move.
-I just stopped for water.
-Move.
-I don't know who's house this is.
-Come on.
Stand here! Hands up!
What's your name?
My name is Saleh. I'm not from here.
I'm from Asseera.
I was passing by
and came inside to quench my thirst.
What's this?
What's this? Where do you hide your guns?
I told you I don't know.
You came back for the weapons
and you know where they are.
-Search the house.
-Yes, sir.
I didn't find anything, sir.
-Nothing.
-There is nothing here.
Wait. Look at what I found.
-Let her go.
-Stop! Don't move.
-Leave the women out of this.
-Stop!
-Search her.
-Yes, sir.
Are you pregnant?
-The same hiding place.
-Enough!
Key!
Keep it as a souvenir.
Let her be, you shameless man!
-Boy or girl?
-Girl.
-Boy.
-It sure looks like a boy.
-I think it's boy too.
-What is he saying?
What do you think? Boy or girl?
-Stop!
-You have no shame!
-Wait! She's a woman.
-Don't be scared, Mayssar.
She's just a woman.
-Let them be!
-Come on! Move!
They are just children.
Mommy…
It's okay.
Kill me. I'm the man here. Kill me.
So you did not hide weapons.
You hid something else.
Saleh!
Let them be!
Put them in front of the wall.
Stand here. Come on.
Come on!
Move.
Are you hiding your face?
These traits cannot be concealed, traitor!
Move!
Fine.
-Take position.
-Yes, sir.
Aim!
Fire!
-No!
-What are you doing there?
-Come and help me.
-I'm coming.
Quickly.
Get some water
instead of sitting there doing nothing.
He's too heavy. We need help, please.
Farha.
No, we left the baby for you.
A boy. I was right. I won.
Kill him and follow us.
And don't waste a bullet on him.
Don't take too long.
Rock a bye baby
On the tree top
When the wind blows
The cradle will rock
When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall
And down will come baby
Cradle and all
