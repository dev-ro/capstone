We were a real business,
that's what you gotta understand.
I know we were a goddam industry.
The kind that's the
backbone of this country.
Go in the parking lot and look on the
license of that brand-new Mercedes 450.
Hey, you see this?
That's Ferris Creek. This picture
is over a hundred years old.
Now, you see this
handsome Bill right here?
He's a Wells!
Ok. So...
I know you're a mining company.
But I pictured...
Well, I don't know what
I pictured exactly. Those little...
...little carts going down
little train tracks.
Tell me, what is it
that you do here?
What we do is we look for the
metals and the minerals, alright?
There's exploration over there,
there's engineering and there's production.
We're prospectors.
AMi hip?
Ok, how about this?
So, let's say that this...
...is the earth.
My handbag!
Your handbag is Mother Earth...
with all of her deep held mysteries
and goodies on the inside...
...that she does not want to give up.
Me, I'm Man and I'm damn curious
about what she's got inside.
So, I send down what's
called an exploratory drill.
I look down inside and dig around.
I come across something,
I pull it out it.
It's nickel. Now...
Nickel's actually
75% copper and 25% nickel...
...but there's a lot of nickel in the world
and the world needs nickels.
I go back down there to
get my second core sample...
...and I happen to
pull up say, silver!
Now the thing is,
when you find a little bit of this...
...that means there could be
a whole hell of a lot of it!
So we start raising money.
We raise enough money to open a mine.
...like the one
in that picture right there.
Then, we dig it all up.
Now, sometimes,
not that often, but sometimes...
...the prospecting gods are
havin' a party at the girlie cage...
...and we get real,
real, really lucky.
Then we dig down in there.
Then we find a little metal called...
...gold!
Yes.
Kenny!
You like it?
I love you.
I love you.
Old man wants to see you.
Good afternoon MaryAnne.
Hey, Pop!
I heard you want to see me.
Yeah, Kenny.
You get you're ass in here, would you?
Would you run through this
Pershing County strategy again for me?
Right, umm.
It's about this southern part
of this Newmont property, right here.
But Newmont just started
drilling at 140 meters...
...and they're finding a
whole lot of magnesite.
Now, if you remember, we still own
the option on Relief Canyon...
...which is next to them.
We're not findin' squat. Why?
We're not drilling deep enough,
let's get back in there.
Drill deeper.
Go to 140, if we need to...
...and we got a damn good chance of
gettin' relief back from production.
What about Jarrett Canyon?
Oh, that's your baby. You know a
hell of a lot more about than I do.
The assays look promising.
Could be fuckin' huge.
I want you to run coin on this.
All in.
Scale it up!
Make it yours.
Yes, sir.
Well, Clark Coleman's on board.
Those boys'll ride with you.
God, we work hard in this business,
sometimes for nuthin'.
I wake up every morning,
I tell myself: "I don't have to do this".
I get to do this.
And then it's just...
...blue skies.
Blue skies, baby.
My old man...
...the legend.
That was the last time
I saw him alive.
Hello? Pour one for Kenny.
God bless you, Roy!
Boys, to the mother lode!
Mother lode!
Today be the day.
Geological reports on this
are highly encouraging.
We're taking a
very aggressive look.
Prospectus? Of course. I can have
my secretary send you one right out.
But I gotta tell you, this offering
is already oversubscribed.
But we can always try and
get you in on the next one.
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, I understand.
You watchin' the time?
It's 7:15, Kenny.
Oh, Christ!
What would I do without you?
Mr. Wells!
Yes.
Lloyd Stanton.
Hello, Lloyd.
Hi there! his is my colleague,
Henry Andrews. Nice to meet you.
Come on back!
Absolutely.
After you.
So, what can we do for ya?
Well, why don't we wait for Clive?
Oh, ah, Mr. Coleman
got tied up in a meeting.
No offense, boys, but I'm
supposed to be meeting with Clive.
None taken!
But if you were supposed
to be meeting with Clive,
you would be
meeting with Clive.
Alright, here is what we have.
We are developing
some very exciting properties...
... that are spot-on
for your investor profile.
Low buy-in,
sizable upside.
And the beautiful part is they only
need 12 to 18 months to be cash-positive.
Manitoba?
Yeah, we picked up an option on
a skipped claim at an auction.
Right, but it's a 90 day option.
Yes, the window is narrow,...
...but if you've looked at the "geo",
you'd see a very promising...
...shelf formation that
hasn't been tapped yet.
Mr. Wells, Washoe has a practical
value hovering just above zero.
Your debt load is untenable
and you bring us...
...a roll-in with no
infrastructure, no fundable assets...
I mean you can't possibly
expect us to underwrite this.
Yeah, I'm talking about
a small offering here...
...as I said in the beginning,
a low buy-in. Now if...
...you'll take a second look at the
"geo", you will see what I see.
And that's money!
Not our money.
You see, the thing is that
the whole economy had turned...
...particularly for commodities.
Close of the day, Washoe was trading at
4 cents a share, if it was trading at all.
Washoe Mining, there's this
great old land lease...
...because this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Right! Well, Washoe,
Washoe Mining.
You know, carryin'...
carryin' on the business.
You know, there's still minerals out there.
We just gotta find them, right?
Yeah, uh huh, alright.
Thank you.
12 to 18 months,
cash positive.
Do you...
...do you mind callin' it flatwater...
Washoe Mining...
...the company that my grandfather...
...literally scratched out of the
side of a Nevada mountain.
The company that my father
made into a real player...
...is almost gone.
Almost.
I already lost my house and I was...
I was livin' with Kay.
Now, we...we, we...
we're about to lose that too.
I have a half gallon of Seagram's in me.
Shit, most people would've
been dead but not me. No!
Instead, I had a dream.
I mean, I mean, I mean, literally...
I, I had a dream.
Indonesia.
Gold.
Now, I'd been to Indonesia
5 or 6 years earlier.
I still had a little money in my pocket.
You know, Indonesia was booming.
And I was lookin' for a way to get in.
Where back then, if you wanted to put
a hole in the ground in Indonesia...
...you wanted Mike Acosta
tellin' you where to dig.
He was what they called
a River Walker.
A real hands-on geologist,
the real deal.
Oxford College, M.I.T. His mom was
Venezuelan, his dad was English.
I see he just discovered the largest
copper strike in Southeast Asia.
And everybody wanted a
piece of it, including me.
You got the Nazca plate, the Pacific plate,
Wanga Fuca, North American, South America...
Aleutian, Marianas, Tonga.
The plates rubbin' and grinding
up on each other...
...6 trillion kilobars of pressure,
10,000 degrees Celsius...
...kicking up geothermic hotspots
all along the Pacific Rim.
They call it the "Ring Of Fire" theory.
He definitely had everyone's attention.
That's how I found the copper.
That's why I'll find the gold.
Hi, hon.
You want to talk about yesterday?
No, I've got to go right now, babe.
I've got a plan.
Alright, Kenny...Kenny, listen,
Carl had an idea.
Makin'...?
Mm-hmm.
He said he could get you on
for a while, if you wanted..
I don't think it's going
to be necessary, baby.
Yeah but it'd just be temporary,
'til the market turns.
We could figure out from there.
I'll get done with this trip, alright?
It shouldn't take more than a week.
What? Where are you going?
Babe?
I'll call you from there.
Baby, wait, wait!
Kenny!
It was like I was being called.
It was the gold calling.
It may sound crazy to you but if
you knew that feeling, you'd know.
Kenny Wells, I'm down here
in the lobby at the Jakarta Palace.
Yeah, listen, we must have
gotten the times mixed up.
Let me know. I'm down here in
a brown suit on a green couch.
I'm a good lookin' guy! Ok?
Alright, we'll make it
out of town. Alright.
Wells?
Mike!
Good to see you again.
I know a local place
with a bit more color.
We're here!
Good.
What are we
talking about here, Wells?
Ring Of Fire, Mike.
Ring Of Fire.
I hope you hear my greatest hits.
The fire's gone out of that one.
Well, what are you talkin' about?
In the opinions of my
fellow esteemed geologists.
The whole thing I'm quoting here,
it's a crock of shit.
Well, what the hell, you know?
You called it wrong.
What are you going to do?
There's no right or wrong
in this business.
Some have hits and misses.
There's gold here.
I'm glad you said that, Mike.
I truly am,
because I believe you.
I hate to dash your hopes but...
...others have come along before you
with the same thought and...
...from the looks of it,
with deeper pockets.
Ring Of Fire is real, Mike.
I knew it the first time I heard it.
It struck me like a fuckin'
lightning bolt and I never forgot it.
Now go ahead.
Have a hell of a good time...
...but hear this.
I don't just believe, I know.
How do you know?
I've seen it.
You're wrong this time.
No one will back me.
I'll help.
You tell me where you want to dig, Mikey..
...and I'll make goddamned
sure the bills are paid.
No offence, Wells, but you look like you
had to rob someone just to get here.
You know nothing about me.
You know it's still out there.
You know that.
I can see it in your eyes,
you still believe.
I get it. I was born on
the side of a mountain too.
My father scratched everything
he ever owned out of a fuckin' rock.
The guy died with dirt under his
fingernails. I intend to do the same thing.
This business wrote me off years ago.
Yeah, alright,
maybe you're not runnin' pars...
...ending your career right now,
so let's prove 'em wrong
You and me, let's prove them all
fucking wrong. And you know why?
You do know why, because
the Ring Of Fire is right, Mike.
You called it!
You just haven't found it yet.
Tell me I'm crazy,
I'll be on the next plane.
You're crazy.
Do you have a hat, Wells?
Yeah, I got a hat.
Are we going somewhere?
Upriver.
What river is that, Mike?
You're late.
The only one that matters.
The Daya have been panning
this river for over 5000 years.
That's how it got it's name...
Daya Kencana.
What's it mean?
Daya means "ox breed".
Kencana means "gold".
You gotta be shittin' me!
Wells, Wells, we're here.
So, listen,
the Daya are warrior people.
Probably best known
for Nayo...headhunting.
But it doesn't happen much anymore.
They might be thinking we're some traders
or someone's mother-in-law.
this jungle will test you.
It will hold you up..
It will weigh you and decide
your worth within an ounce.
You always talk like this, Mike?
Like a book on tape?
I suppose I do.
Where we goin'?
Up.
Take a look.
Oh, my god!
There have been a few folks up here tappin'
over the years.
They focused on the foothills
and parts of the south.
But what interests me,
it's the other way.
That small depression, like a giant
left a footprint walking away..
Something happened there, Wells.
Something hot and angry.
That's where we'll find a place to dig.
My dream.
It's out there.
Damn right, it is!
Look, Mr. Big Boys,
if you're thinkin' about investin' much...
You know, a Harvard endowment or some...
...some pension fund.
I am not your guy.
The little guys, right? The guys
that you don't even know about.
The hustlers, the scrappers,
the make-it-happen motherfuckers.
Those are my guys.
How much do we need?
Seven...seven fifty, to start.
Ok, how much do we need?
It's not just the lease.
We're in Indonesia. That means
getting a permit and lining pockets
Equipment. You're not gonna do this with
just a couple of shovels and a pickaxe.
I'll get the money.
Whatever it takes.
What's that?
It's a contract.
Read it. Sign it.
Keep it.
I can feel it in my bones.
I was selling
something that I believed in.
20K minimum buy-in and the shares
are fuckin' fallin' off the shelf!
I mean, no risk, no gain, right?
Lucas is comin' in, right now.
No, Acosta, Michael Acosta.
It's the largest copper strike in history
and that's the God's honest truth!
Maybe you get those shoes
shined with Nancy, baby!
They don't even have the exploration forms.
Why are we selling?
What are we selling?
Mike, we're selling the story!
Right now, the story is you.
Speaking of which, what the fuck
are you doing right now?
I'm down in Kupang City
to look at coring equipment.
Acosta's in Kupang City,
looking at coring equipment.
Kupang City, as we speak.
Kupang City, it's a fuckin' city.
Kupang City!
You're magic, Mike,
you're fuckin' magic!
You there, Mike?
$267,434 dollars!
It's not exactly the number
I had in mind, Wells.
Well, look. I mean, I may be able to borrow
a little bit to get there but you know...
No, you know what truth might tip it?
That's it for now.
That, that's it!
Can you make it work? Hm?
I can make anything work!
You work out of a bar room?
Keepin' a lid on expenses, Mike.
Makin' the dollar holler!
We're in!
Clear this place! Fast!
Fast!
A record player,
that's classy.
You payin' for that, Mikey?
6 man crews,
12 hour shifts...
...around the clock.
Tomorrow, I'll start working
on core samples.
Then we'll send the most promising
downriver to the assay lab.
The mother lode, Mike!
You're out there, baby!
Whoever invented the hamburger
was smart, Mike.
The man who
invented the cheeseburger...
...now that's genius!
Just don't ask where
the meat came from.
Have you ever read
Christopher Columbus' journals?
Of course not.
In his petition to
the queen of Spain...
...he promised the conversion...
...to her holy faith, of a
great number of people.
And he went on and
mentioned God 26 times.
Gold, on the other hand...
...he mentioned 114 times.
Smart dago!
I been wanting to
ask something, Wells.
Fire away, Mike.
What's the meaning of
that tattoo on your arm?
Oh, it's a bird.
It's from a poem that
I read when I was a kid.
A bird with no feet...
...sleeps in the wind.
Ese, Ese, Ese!
Thanks, man.
Mike! Mike! Hey!
You see.
They look worse every time we get one.
Do you remember when
I told you about patience?
Yeah, you know what
I told you about money?
Yeah, you said that
it wasn't a problem.
It's a fuckin' problem now!
Hey!
Wait!
Wait! Hey, hey, hey!
Wait!
Hey! Wait! Wait!
On top of everything else...
...I got a bad case of malaria,
It kills like a million people a year
or something like that.
Suddenly, I was on the list.
Maybe we pushed them too hard.
Maybe we should just take it easy, you know.
Cut a man and
give them smaller shifts.
Maybe they'll come back.
You know?
Who knows? We get something
at the end and it all works out.
I want a piece of the pie, you know.
Get up. Come on.
Get up.
I'm just freezin', Mike.
Listen, I'm gonna die
and have nuthin', right?
You rest now.
We started running
out of money, that's true.
What can I do for you
to come back to work?
Is he sick?
Does he have a cough?
Drink. Drink.
I pulled the plug.
No.
No, no, no, no no, Mike!
No, no. You can't do that, Mikey.
Let's get you out of here at once.
What's the plan, Mikey?
No, I know you got a plan, Mike.
I know you've got a plan.
What's the plan?
What's the plan?
We distill water.
If we get filter systems up here,
I think they might come back..
I've got about $1,800
on this Visa right there.
Put a... on this Diners Club.
Use it all.
Use it all, Mike.
Man, if he didn't go to every single place
that every one of our workers lived.
Streams that had no name...
...all feeding the great Kencana river.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
You know what?
The workers came back.
I spent the next few weeks
in a malarial haze.
I should've been dead.
Mike kept it all going.
What day is it?
No idea.
Month?
August.
You been sitting there this whole time?
Let's not get carried away.
What did the report say?
It says...
We pulled 17 more cores.
What? No good?
Not good.
More in the vicinity of great.
No shit, Mike.
Don't do this to me, man!
Eighth of an ounce per ton.
Eight, eighth of an ounce per what?
Eighth of an ounce per ton.
What, what are you saying, Mike?
We got a strike, Kenny.
We've got a gold mine?
We've got a gold mine?
We've got a gold mine.
We got a gold mine, Mike!
We got a gold mine, Mike!
We got a gold mine, Mike.
We got a gold mine!
We got a goddam gold mine!
We got a goddam gold mine!
We got a gold mine!
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!
Fuck you, mosquitos!
At that moment, no way I could
possibly describe the feeling.
It's amazing how a little gold dust
can just change everything.
And for better or worse,
the ride had begun.
And what a goddam ride!
Ok, okay.
Excuse me.
The best goddam team in the business!
Fuckin' A, you're a standup guy, Kenny!
Sharin' the wealth.
Mother lode!
Mother lode!
Mother lode!
Alright, baby, do me a favor.
Close your eyes, will you?
Alright.
Cover 'em with your hands.
Keep 'em closed.
Ok!
Ok, I gotcha, I gotcha.
Ok.
One...two...
...three.
It's going to be our place.
Away from it all, above it all,
just like we always wanted.
Do you like it?
Huh?
Yes. Yes!
You got it.
The house...
...right here, alright?
...the kitchen, facing there,
the great room over here...
...2 fireplaces!
Can we afford this?
Almost, baby, almost. We're almost there.
Alright, look at this...
4 bedrooms on that end...
...4 bedrooms on that end. Look at
this playground for the kids, huh?
How many kids you want to have?
The kitchen has to stay over here.
We've got to put it over
here for the morning light.
And a second kitchen over on this side...
...a third one across the creek,
a fourth one up there with the elk.
Kenny! Kenny!
This is Walt Keeler,
he publishes Gold Digger magazine.
We reach half a million subscribers...
...and they'd all love to know what
you've got cookin' over there in Indonesia.
Gimme a minute,
I'll buy you a drink.
He's all yours, Walt.
Hell, I read Gold Digger magazine.
Come on. Say, you make the sale,
you get the Golden Pickaxe.
What do you say about that?
I say you probably just jinxed it.
How many ounces you guess?
A million, Walt. Absolutely millions.
Easy million?
No, hard rock, it's varsity ball.
How's the infrastructure?
Building it from the ground up.
Any message you'd like to give to
the readers of Gold Digger magazine?
The last card you turn over
is the only one that matters.
Kenny, it's good to see you.
Good morning, Beverly.
Clive, how are you?
There he is.
Good to see you, sir.
Good to see you, son.
You know, your father and I,
we started together in this business.
Hell, he put me into business.
I don't have to tell you that.
He always spoke very highly of you, Clive.
He was one of the
best men I ever knew.
Yes.
Now...
You have gone from 4 to 23 cents
on your first assay results.
And you pulled in two more
to confirm those finding?
three more.
Three more?
That's fantastic.
Well, I would like to underwrite a
private palacement of Washoe stock.
And I believe that we can raise anywhere
between 8 and 10 million dollars.
Well, capital's definitely at
the top of our agenda, right now.
Well, yes it is...
...and a lot of people are going
to want to make this deal.
But history's on our side.
Mm-hm.
But I just wish you'd have
brought this to me sooner.
I'd have helped you from the getgo.
Well, here we are.
Here we are.
Lloyd, top that off for me, will you?
Straight black with a spicer chaser.
Mr. Wells. your coffee.
There we are, Lloyd. Thank you.
Stanton, Mr. Wells has agreed to
give us his business, on one condition.
Lloyd, I want you to
personally handle my account.
I need you to be
available to me, 24/7, 365...
...as you will be
riding shotgun in my jockstrap.
Absolutely, yes. Thank you.
Well, let's quit standin' around here and
let's go make some goddam money.
Sounds good to me.
Kenny, Kenny!
Kenny, did you read the last report?
Kenny, did you read the last report?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm looking at it right now.
Holy shit!
Holy shit is right, my friend.
You know, that's unbelievable.
Holy shit!
Arbie, I can hear you
wide smilin' from here.
Right back where you belong, Kenny.
There's a lot of gold...
...in this this building, Lloyd.
Whoa, nice work, Todd.
Alright, men.
Now this stock is gonna start cookin'.
Make sure you put a little bit away.
Sell something.
Just along the way. Just in case.
Especially you!
What?
Put a little bit away. For the first time in
your life, think rainy day, Bobby. Ok?
Of course!
Hey, ok?
Ok. Hey.
Oh, we're going to be so fucking rich.
Look like you're workin', ay.
Yeah?
What do you got?
Wildcatters, basically..
This Mike Acosta has had
some success..copper.
Got taken over by Freeport Mack.
It's all in there.
Yeah, I've heard of Acosta.
I like this.
But I think we start with
the good news, which is...
...we are 50% allocated and...
we want to set aside 30% of
the remaining 50% for u-boring...
If you want to sit in here...
...just don't drink too much
Good night.
Or just eat something, as well.
Kay!
What?
Phone, please!
You want me to answer it?
Hello?
Washoe Mining.
How may I direct your call?
Hi there, Kenneth Wells, please.
Please hold.
Kenny, you got a call!
Thank you.
Love you, baby.
Alright. Kenny Wells.
This is Brian Wolf at
Brown Thomas in New York.
I'm with the Minerals & Oil Group.
No shit!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, that sounds outstanding, Brian.
Now, let me tell you something.
I'm lookin' forward to it.
Alright.
They're fuckin' buyin' me out!
Buying me out!
Come on.
The way I see it...
...what banks do...
...who knows.
But what made this country...
..not tight-ass suits, no offense,
taking the easy way down...
...but guys like me and Mike,
who jump.
What we have is a private placement in
play here, already over 50% subscribed.
Now, if the numbers keep coming in good...
They're fucking going to!
The sky is the limit on this thing.
You don't have to sell us.
We've done the math.
We believe you're sitting on
the largest gold find of the decade.
May I speak plainly, Mr. Wells?
Of course, Brian,
that's the only way to speak.
Our clients are gonna want
to see a serious plan...
...to turn lab results
in a volatile region...
...into an investment we can all
stake our reputations on.
It's not going to be a problem.
No, it's not a problem, per se...
...but the fact remains...
that neither of you have taken a
find of this magnitude into production.
Wait just a minute there, Brian.
We, we found it.
We can dig it up.
It's not that complicated.
Actually, historically, we found it
can be quite complicated and...
...we'd like the opportunity
to help you formulate...
...how you present the operation side.
What, what exactly does that mean?
I'd like you both to consider
bringing on a strategic partner.
Alright!
Have any of you ever set one
of your handmade loafers down...
... in a hole in
the side of a mountain?
No! We have.
I know Washoe has history.
We've done a fairly thorough
analysis of Washoe, Mr. Wells...
...and we feel like you need strategic help.
No.
No way. No. This is a new day, alright?
And Indonesia is goddam different.
We can help you get off
the side of that mountain.
We don't need any help getting off
the side of the goddam mountain.
Well, I can land this plane.
I can!
Wells came and found me.
I was at a low point, I have to admit.
It happens in this business. Ups and downs.
But he backed me...
with his last cent.
And more than that,
he risked his life...
...almost lost it, actually.
It was touch-and-go there for a minute.
And now we have the bull by it's horns.
And boys, they're big fucking horns.
I've worked with the best.
And I can tell you, Kenny Wells...
...is up there with them.
We're not, by any stretch of the
imagination, suggesting...
...at this moment, that
anybody take a back seat.
Just be open to strategic alliances.
Fuck!
It's a dime out of every one
of my dollars, not your dollars!
I said "No" a second ago.
You want to invest?
We got the gold.
We can talk about it.
We don't need a fucking partner! You know
there's something about finding gold.
It's so difficult to put into words.
It's very difficult.
The taste of it on your tongue...
...the feel of it
between your fingers...
...it's electric.
It's like a drug...
because it hooks you.
and it's precisely what
you're missing here in this city.
It's what makes it so hard for us
to have this conversation because...
...you have never felt it.
So I have a proposal for you.
Put together your institutional players.
The guys who rep the dig money.
Whoever needs to kick
the tires on this thing...
...I will take them
on a little trip up the river.
So...
...it was Acosta who proposed
the junket in Kencana...
...or did you cook that up together?
I'll change the interview.
You're not getting it. We didn't feel
like we had to cook up...
...anything.
I mean, I had people
coming at me from all sides.
My neighbor, Hart Hubbard,
he's a lawn care professional...
...usually only worried
about Kay's mulberry tree...
...leaning over the back
of his fence. But now...
...he's dropping mining terms:
"Hey, Kenny, how's the
grade purity over there?".
Kencana here, it's great.
How about the core frequency?
Hart fucking Hubbard,
he mows grass for a living.
We interviewed Mr. Hubbard.
What I'm saying is...
...we didn't think we
needed to cook up anything.
Everybody wanted in.
So, it was Acosta who
proposed the banker junket.
Yes.
That was a genius move.
Now, when we get outside...
...you stay close to me
and hang on to your wallets.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Back, back, back, back, back, back.
There he is!
Gentlemen!
Michael Acosta.
Glen.
Acosta.
Bobby.
Acosta.
Jeff Jackson.
If any one of you wants to turn back...
...this is your chance.
What's that?
He's just messin' with you.
Welcome to Indo, boys!
When we got the hit, we
stepped out in a radiating pattern.
And we kept going until
we had a definitive picture.
We're mapping beyond the line geology.
The cores are cut into sections...
...and then crushed.
Then, bagged and sealed.
This cage is guarded 24/7.
under guard...
...the samples are sent downriver
to independent labs in Kalimantan.
If a seal is broken or damaged in any way...
...the lab, by law, has to
discard the entire sample.
Every safeguard has been put in place
to assure the security of the process.
Diamond tip saw blades, rock crushers...
...core samples being ripped
from the guts of the earth...
...it all sounds great but...
...you boys want to see some gold.
No one's going to believe this shit!
So, what do you think?
I'm not sure, what about you?
Acosta seems to know what
he's talking about but, uhh...
...I don't know.
Hey!
Hey!
Come here, come here!
I think, I think I got something.
See this?
A few more like this,
we can pay Wall Street.
When Jackson pulled that nugget out...
...we had 'em.
Brown Thomas is proud to anounce the
public offering of 27 million shares...
...of classic Common Stock and
the initial listing of Washoe Mining...
...on the New York Stock Exchange!
We're all gonna make
a lot of fuckin' money here!
Welcome to the
Waldorf-Astoria, maam.
I'll get your bags right upstairs.
Kenny? Are you here?
Baby? Where are you?
Huh?
What are you doing?
You surprised?
Yeah.
It's your favorite flower, right?
Baby.
You look beautiful, Kay. Come here.
I miss you so much,
you have no idea.
Honey, aren't these the
softest sheets you've ever felt?
Wanna get under them?
Yeah.
Oh, hello Henry.
Everyone meet Kay.
Brian? Hi.
Hollis.
Kay.
Pleasure.
Stan, you know. The only man in this
business who sweats as much as I do.
Alright, let's do this.
Ahh, there he is.
Mike Acosta, the one and only.
Mike...
...meet Kay. Two of my
favorite people in the world!
You now, this one
stole my watch to go meet you.
He stole your watch?
No, no, no! I'm just teasing!
She's teasing.
No, you're not.
No, she's not.
No, I'm not.
I didn't know it but I gotta go.
It's so good to meet you, Mike.
You must be very proud.
Never doubt it for a second.
Whoa!
we got 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Yeah, baby!
In a story we've been
following very closely...
...Washoe Mining may be
The Stock Of The Year.
On their first day on the
New York Stock Exchange...
...Washoe Mining turned into
a rocket ship today.
Hello, pleased to meet you.
Kay, nice to meet you too.
No, no, but thank you.
He took money on the deeds?
True fuckin' story!
Who at this table wants to know the
secret to winning bets for pro football?
What's that?
Take the East coast teams,
they're fuckin' hot, you know why?
The West Coast teams...
Rachel Hill.
Giants fan, huh?
So, what do you do, Rachel Hill?
Investor Relations, Brown Thomas.
On the team!
Here's to that.
You gotta be the best lookin' woman
on the team that they are.
It's like a drunk raccoon
got a hold of the Hope Diamond.
You don't want to get too close but
you're not going to let it get away.
It's your raccoon.
Mm.
You let him run a
multibillion dollar company.
What, and lose you as a client
and half the rest of my business?
There's risks and there's risks.
But it was a good fuckin' bet.
Now who wants to buy me a drink?
2 double shots of Jack.
So tell me, to go out into the
wilderness with your bare hands...
...and discover something
that everybody wants.
How's that feel?
I propose a toast.
Here, here!
To a small creature often misunderstood.
To the raccoon.
Well, fuck me.
The thing is, if
you don't watch, it'll grow.
I can see that now.
I don't want to talk about it.
What did...I wasn't doing anything.
I said I don't want to talk about it. Well,
what the fuck should I have done, huh?
Just bend her over
the table right there...
...and fucking banged her
in front of everybody?
You are too drunk to get it up anyway!
You're a bit jealous, baby!
I don't care about you flirting
with Miss Pneumatic 1988.
You think I haven't seen
that shit before, Kenny?
Babe, she had tiny little fuckin' titties...
...you don't think they were real?
No, none of this is real.
None of it!
Why are you fuckin' me?
We made it!
Useless...
Hey, what the fuck!
You know what your
problem is, Katie?
No, why don't you tell me?
You got no vision.
Right? Fuckin' vision! Your vision starts
right here and it goes right here...
...right here's the fuckin' kitchen, see?
And right here's the goddam parking lot,
the furniture store!
Come on.
You mean an actual job...
...that would support a person
in the place that they live?
You mean that vision?
You know what? Fuck you!
Aah Katie, fuck me. Fuck you.
Fuck who, what, what? Don't you
see what's happening here?
Oh, great! Go over here! You pack your
shit and run back to your shit life.
You know what?
I like my shitty life.
It's mine!
Why don't you give it a thought?
You always wanted a broken bird, didn't you?
Said the right things but, in here,
you never fuckin' believed it, did ya?
You never believed in me,
did you, Katie?
Hmm?
You like to be losin', don't ya?
Damn, you don't know.
Come on, admit it.
Does it feel comfortable Kay?
These people are using you.
They don't care about you!
I don't give a shit.
And they certainly
don't believe in you.
Kay, c'mon. I got gold.
Now, can we win? Baby,
could you just let me have the win?
We're winning!
Did it ever occur to you that
I know what I'm doing?
I hope you do.
Huh?
I do.
I love what's in there.
More than you'll ever know.
These guys are gonna tear you up.
Don't ask me to watch
what happens next.
I know what I'm doing, Kay.
I know what I'm doing.
What did you do next, Wells?
What did I do?
I rode it.
I rode it, Jennings.
Another double. Seagrams on the rocks.
Yes, sir.
And I'll have the same.
Oh, goddam! You
don't have to impress me.
Reminds me of my childhood.
So how was I to figure the very
enchanted world of Kenny Wells?
A million bucks...
...would feel a hundred times better.
That must be a very nice feeling.
You know, it
looks like there's a...
...few other people around here
with a similar feeling.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
How does someone
like yourself end up here?
I know Tom.
Tom is a friend.
Oh, I bet he is.
Now, now.
I stay with his cousin, Timmy,
down the lane.
Timmy's really quite a character,
if you get to know him.
i don't know Timmy.
I don't really feel like talking.
Let's just feel the waves.
Wells!
Kenny Wells?
Uh hah!
Mark Hancock. Seems I've caught you
at a bit of a disadvantage, Mr. Wells
Depends on how you look at it.
Kenny goddam Wells, Mark.
This is Rachel.
Oh, I know the lovely Rachel.
You know this sonofabitch here,
he controls more gold than
anybody on the goddam planet.
Possible exception now, Mr. Wells.
This is how it happens, huh?
This is how it happens.
God damn.
What could I tell you, Kenny,
it's a generous offer. It's a fuckin' joke!
Let's take a...
This isn't a deal, Brian...
...this is a goddam rape!
Listen to me!
No, no, no! This is mine!
This is mine!
I. I found it.
Me and Mike, we were the ones
up to our ass in the mud...
...and the shit and the malaria!
And this little prick offers
a minority partnership?
Kenny, let's keep
some perspective here, ok?
Whenever anybody offers this
amount of money, it's a good day.
You may say yes,
you may say no...
...but it's not like anybody's
trying to offend you.
Well, mission goddam not accomplished!
Hancock & Newport Holdings have the
expertise and experience to bring this home.
This is always there as a contingency,
you know that. No, no, no, no.
This is where Washoe Mining becomes
a player. Right here, right now.
Not Mark fuckin' Hancock
and Newport Holdings.
I don't even see our name on here,Brian.
You took our name,
you took my name off it.
But if we take a step back here...
...wouldn't it not be terrible to
sit back and enjoy your success?
Wouln't it not be terrible?
What the fuck kind of way
of talking is that, Brian?
Wouldn't it not be terrible if I
bend over and grab my ankles...
...so you can fuck me up the ass?
What? You think you can
buy me out and take my name?
Well, just throw Kenny Wells in the
fuckin' cornfield. Fuck you Brian!
If we hit Pause for a second
and consider without emotion...
...I think you'll realize that this is
one of those very rare moments...
...where with the stroke of a pen...
...no one in your family, I'm talkin'
your childrens' grandchildren...
...will ever have to worry
about money again.
You see these hands, Brian?
These are my father's hands.
I have scratched and clawed through
the hot earth with these hands.
And I will bury you with these hands.
Now you walk down a silky... like Hancock.
He works for Kenny Wells.
My fuckin' day!
My day!
And now, all must respect this guy.
That was a pretty foolish
business decision, wasn't it?
You're a foot away
from livin' in your car.
You turned down 300 million dollars?
Over naming rights?
Yeah, I did.
Because Kencana would become a Newport mine.
I didn't want fucking Hancock's
Midas touch to continue.
It was me, Kenny Wells...
...the lucky bastard who fell down
drunk and woke up in a pile of cash.
No.
It was my my dream.
I dreamed it.
You sell your dream...
...what do you have left?
What's up? What's up?
What is it, sir? What is it?
Hey, wait! Hey!
Good morning, Stacy, how are you today?
Good. Get Ronny.
Good?
Ok.
Mike, hang on.
Kenny's here.
It's Mike, there's a fuckin' shitstorm!
Mikey what's up?
They're locking us out.
They're what?
They're locking us out.
The military's here.
They're taking over the mine.
What happened at your meeting with Hancock?
What happened
at the meeting, Kenny?
Listen, Mike, they were
trying to push us out.
Push us out? What
do you mean push us out?
They took, they took our
names out, Mike.
Mine and yours, they took our fucking
names off! Ah, you fucking moron!
They can't just revoke the permit.
Alright, they can't just steal it away.
Kenny what? Of course
they can revoke the permit!
Suharto can do
whatever the fuck he wants!
Hey! Hey!
Mike! Kenny, what's goin' on?
What the fuck is goin' on?
Go! Please don't shoot!
Please don't shoot!
Mike. Mike!
Kenny, at the site, I told you, man...
...you knew exactly who
we were dealing with.
These people are killers.
Hancock first among them.
I told you, Kenny!
Now, it's gone.
So it turns out that,
in addition to having, umm...
...longstanding ties with Suharto...
...Newport Holdings had on it's Board a
certain ex-President of the United States.
He was also in at one
of Suharto's weddings.
He was a groomsman.
Well, you see, the whole time...
...they're telling me how rich
my grandkids are going to be...
...they got a backup plan.
Now, they're going to
pick my pocket and steal it all away.
Washoe stock was off nearly 50 points
at the Opening Bell this morning...
...on news of the Suharto government's
revocation of Washoe's exploration rights.
President & CEO, Kenny Wells, has not...
What fucking comment?
They stole it!
They goddam stole it!
You're gonna need to go home, Kenny.
Just pour me a goddam drink, Roy.
Go home, Kenny.
This is us, we can't
get to the phone...
This is us, we can't get to the phone
right now, you know what to do.
Kay! Hey, Kay!
It's me, uhh...
Hey, I guess you're not home.
You know, I was just callin'...
...I just want to hear your voice.
I screwed up, okay?
I wanted to build something.
Something real that would last,
for me and you.
For Dad.
That's all I wanted to do.
You were right, you know?
You were right.
Again.
I love you, Kay.
I'm gonna stop now.
I'm not gonna call.
I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
Where is he?
Here you are.
Get up!
Quit fuckin' kicking me!
Levantate!
...cocky fuckin' talk...
Huh?
Fuckin' moron!
You know what they say?
You're a drunk.
A clown.
Out of your league.
Fuck them.
Fuck them.
You know what? Fuck you too!
You think I want to hear it
from the fucking golden boy...
...standing there in his golden glow telling
me how messed up everything is, huh?
Now, go fuckin' back to
your perch at the Jakarta Palace, huh.
Ah, you can use that instinct of yours to
find some new strike with some new people.
Is that what you think?
I know you, man. You're Mike fucking Acosta!
Prick.
Ok.
Let me tell you what really happened
We were in North Sulawesi.
Monsoon season. It's 1980.
Yeah, famous copper strike.
All of us looking for bauxite.
On my way to where
I'm planning to drill...
I get stuck.
5 feet of mud.
We're just sitting in the rain day
after day, watching the metal rust.
What did you do?
Under the theory that it's better
to do something than nothing, I...
...reported this was the spot.
Nowhere became somewhere.
The place you got stuck.
I got lucky.
I fuckin' love that!
You were looking for bauxite
and you found copper.
I went looking for gold and...
...found a friend.
That is the single hokiest thing
I've ever heard in my life.
So, you got a plan?
Don't you?
So! Get this!
Turns out, Suharto had a son,
his youngest, Darmadi.
aka Danny.
Bit of a screwup, a real
problem for the old man.
Safe to say,
we understood each other.
So, Suharto had been trying to
get Danny set up for years...
...but everything Danny touched
turned to shit.
Now I figure, if we can
bring Danny onboard as a partner...
...maybe he could get Daddy to change
his mind and swing things back our way.
Now, it was a Hail Mary
from our own one yard line...
...but it was all we had.
It also didn't hurt
that Danny had been...
...regularly ignored by a certain
ex-president of the United States...
...who was a groomsman at
his father's third wedding...
...and also happened to sit
on the Board at Newport Holdings.
So this guy goes to
a Cadillac Dealership...
...the dealer comes out and says: "Sir,
are you thinking about buying a Cadillac?".
He says: "No, I'm
definitely buying a Cadillac.
What I'm thinking about is pussy.
Oh, shit.
Cadillac is...
...pussy magnet!
You're right, Cadillac.
Yeah! Hey!
Binchaya to meet you!
I got a ride, Chuck.
President Gerald Ford, tall man.
George H.W. Bush, a very tall man.
Mark Hancock, also a tall man.
My father, small man.
Small in stature.
But he loves his family.
Mine too. Yeah!
Died in the driveway bringing in
the groceries for my mother.
His heart.
Can't make sense of it.
To father of Wells.
85/15 split, if you have the balls.
50/50 and I might consider it.
It's a fucking deal.
That's a deal, if you have the balls.
No balls, no deal.
Kenny!
Do you have balls?
You don't think I got the fuckin' balls?
Yeah!
So what?
Want me to go in there?
Fuck my 85 bits.
No balls, no deal.
Look at him!
I'm touchin' his...!
If I pull my cock out,
we go 60/40. Fuck you!
Mike, I'm touching a tiger
right between the eyes!
Hollis!
What's goin' on?
You haven't heard?
Wells cut a deal.
A deal? What are you talking about?
Who cut a deal with him?
Suharto.
The Indonesian Government.
What?
Washoe retains 15% of the find...
...the other 85% goes to a company
of Suharto's choosing...
...which just so happens to
be owned by his son.
Wells cut us off at the knees.
What about Hancock?
He's out. He can't
compete at that number
The deal's done, Brian.
Wells and Acosta are now the
only outside partners...
...in the biggest gold strike in history.
We represent exactly none of it.
15% is a terrible deal!
Is it?
What's 15% of 30 billion dollars?
I can explain. You met him!
You'll be fine, Brian.
You'll land on your feet.
Hey, hey!
Thought you'd come home with a
bone in your nose or some such thing?
How we doin', Roy?
Good.
Hey, where's Kay?
You didn't hear?
Hear what?
She quit. She got a promotion
out of the store.
Assistant manager.
Hey, Roy? Turn that up.
Kenny Wells, you're in the news, man!
A colossal gold strike, fending off
a takeover by Newport Holdings.
Washoe shares are soaring
on the market.
Kenny!
Can I see you a minute?
Whatcha got, Clyer?
I just got a call.
The National Association Of Prospectors is
gonna honor you with the Golden Pickaxe.
You shittin' me?
No, I'm not.
You are now the
best miner in the world.
And I'm sure somewhere
your daddy is smiling.
Goddam! If he's not,
I'll smile for both of us.
Where you goin'?
To find someone.
Yeah!
Mike, I didn't think
you could make it.
Ok.
Shit, I'm nervous.
I'm nervous.
You're gonna be ok.
Every last one of us...
...who calls the great
state of Nevada home...
...arrived here with a dream.
It was my great granddad
who came out here on a wagon.
He had a horse and he had 2 mules. When
they finally stopped moving and said...
...this is the place.
Too much?
It's good.
Thank you.
My great-granddad was one of us.
He came out here with
2 horses and a mule and...
...you know, he crossed
6 states before he slowed down.
And then it was when he got here that he
finally pulled those reins back and said...
...this is the place.
What is a prospector?
No, no, um, seriously. What?
What is a prospector?
It's someone who
believes it's out there.
He wakes up every morning again
and again and again and again.
Believin' it's out there.
And then it's not? Right?
It's not!
And he's standin' on the
edge of the desert, starin' a...
...new day sunrise right
in the eye and...
...and he hears that little voice,
that little voice that says...
...go ahead. Keep walking.
And the sun gets higher and higher...
...and it's shining down on him
and it's really hot...
...and he doesn't have any water to drink
and everybody that came with him...
...wants to turn back and eventually,
they do turn back and there he is...
He's all alone...
...with the belief...
...that's it's out there.
It's out there.
That's a prospector.
That's a prospector.
Congratulations.
That was really great!
What? Say again?
I don't understand.
Kenny, what's going on?
Kenny, what happened?
I don't know.
I'm going to find out.
I don't know any more than you.
You're not going to
get away with this!
Back the fuck off!
Kenny, please fix this!
What happened, huh?
What happened?
The independent assayer. They
couldn't reproduce Mike's findings.
There's no gold.
Kenny, there's no goddam gold.
There never was.
That's impossible.
The image on the left is the type of gold
found in the Washoe samples.
This is river gold.
Notice how the edges are rounded,
worn smooth by the erosion of water.
What we should have found is
flake gold, the sample on the right.
Pulled directly from the rock
rough-edged and angular.
That's a pretty darn big detail
to overlook, wouldn't you say?
It's a big detail but...
...you have to understand, everything else
about the Washoe samples was right.
But the gold was wrong!
It's called "salting". It literally means
when someone sprinkles gold dust...
... into a rock sample,
like you salt your steak.
It is the oldest trick in the book.
Oldest trick in the book?
And yet major mining corporations,
investment banks, the auditors...
...everyone was fooled.
We weren't fooled.
We just didn't look.
By all appearances, Washoe's
security protocols were ironclad.
But, when the person administrating
the security is fraudulent...
...the whole system goes down.
Right. Did he say where he was going?
Did he mention Jakarta?
I'll call you back.
The New York Stock Exchange
just suspended trading.
They're taking Washoe off the Board.
You sold some, right?
Yeah!
Of course.
Bobby?
I thought...
I thought it was just
gonna keep on going up.
Damn it, Bobby! I told you
from the beginning...
...just put some away.
Save a little bit, just in case.
How many times did I tell you that?
Kenny, did you know?
Did you know, Kenny?
Did I know?
I can't believe
you would ask me that.
I'm asking you that. Did you know?
No, I goddam didn't know, Bobby.
Kenny.
Kenny.
What?
I don't even know
how to tell you this.
Look...
Acosta was dumping stock.
Shell companies...
...banks in the Philipines,
the fuckin' Azores, Gibraltar.
Multiple layers. All offshore.
How much?
164 million.
Ok, uhh.
What are we gonna do?
I don't fuckin' believe this.
this is the FBI!
Step away from your desks!
Take 2 big steps away from your desks.
Do not touch anything!
How much money was lost in the fraud,
that we know of?
Billions. The large institutional
investors lost billions of dollars.
So one or maybe both
of them, 2 outsiders...
...took everybody on
Wall Street for a ride.
Ja, it really looks like
they did. Ja.
And Acosta has vanished with
hundreds of millions of dollars.
Kenny Wells has always
maintained his innocence...
...that he was duped
along with everyone else.
Given that, what do
you think of this?
Kenny Wells,
a fool or a mastermind?
It's a very good question, Joe.
Uhmm...
Michael Acosta was
my friend and partner.
Uhmm.
He betrayed me.
And I know, as CEO of Washoe Mining...
it's my responsibility to know
everything that's going on...
...and I didn't.
That's not an excuse.
I sincerely apologize to everybody and
anybody that lost on their investments.
Oh, Mike!
Mikey, come on in, man.
What happened, huh?
Howard!
I saw you on TV!
Hey, man, can I talk
to you for a minute please?
Look, I just want to know
where my money went. Come on!
Ok.
Mr. Wells, Mr. Wells...
...exactly when will
you be departing?
Uhh, later. A few days or so.
I'll let you know.
We just need to talk about your bill, sir.
I'll be down, we'll settle it then.
Do I need a lawyer?
Do you need a lawyer?
Right answer.
How did you meet Mike Acosta?
We, uhh...
First time or second time?
How'd you meet him, Wells?
It was April...
...of '88, when I was on
the balls of my ass...
...scrambling.
Not exactly uncharted waters for me.
I was in deep.
I think it's pretty unlikely we'll
ever see your partner again.
What are you talking about?
A lot of very powerful people are
very angry at Michael Acosta.
What happened?
What happened?
17 billion dollars of value
disappeared overnight.
Mike Acosta waves goodbye to you
in the ballroom downstairs...
...and goes back to Indonesia on
a jet chartered with Washoe funds.
Then he does a disappearing act.
But this you know.
First, he's locked out of the
Assay Lab in Kalimantan...
by the Minister Of The Interior.
So, he goes back to Jakarta...
Mike Acosta, step this way.
...where he's immediately detained
by the Indonesian military.
And they hold him while they
try to reproduce for themselves...
...the lab results cliamed by Washoe.
Which, of course,
they are unable to do.
Now, at this point...
...either he's being transferred
to an actual prison...
...or he's bribed one of the officers.
Either way, he's on a military helicopter.
They fly north, loosely
tracking the Kencana River.
A thousand feet up...
...over the Kencana...
...Mike Acosta takes a header.
No way.
No fuckin' way.
He either faked it or he payed to have
this bullshit story you're tellin' put out.
164 million dollars goes
a long way in Indonesia.
They found a body.
Hands and face were eaten away,
probably by wild pigs.
You sure this is him?
I'm not sure of anything...
...except Mike Acosta traded
water filters for river gold and...
...now the Indonesian Government have
gone unusually quiet on the subject.
There was an autopsy, corroborating
the identity of the body.
They then sealed the report...
...and cremated the remains.
Interestingly, Danny Suharto, your friend,
dumped a lot of stock as well.
So, the Suhartos
are even richer now.
Mike Acosta is ostensibly
dead and buried and...
...164 million dollars is still missing...
...and the only question I'm left with is
whether or not you were in on it.
Nah, nah, I can't believe it.
Can't believe what?
That, that this business...
...had written Mike off years ago, alright?
They called his theories crap...
...but he...
...there's no way.
He wouldn't. He fuckin' couldn't!
let this be the last word on it.
No fuckin' way!
You're talking about Acosta or yourself?
Look, we were running out of money, right?
And I was practically dying from malaria.
I gave Mike the last dollar to my name
and I made him promise me something.
I said: "Mike, don't let me
die out here for nothing".
A few weeks later I came to
and Mike was there.
Said we got...
We got a strike, Kenny!
We got a goddam gold mine!
And there's no way that he
set out to swindle anyone,
...he just saved
the mine one more time!
And he didn't want to let me down.
You're fuckin' lying!
Levine, sit down!
Do you want to talk about the truth?
Alright, let's talk about the truth.
The only truth here is that...
...when everybody's gettin' rich,
nobody gives a shit about the truth.
And come the fuck on,
all anybody had to do was look!
Open their eyes! Man, the gold was wrong.
The find was too good.
There were red flags everywhere.
Why did no one look?
Because no one fuckin' wanted to know!
We all wanted to believe.
Me, you, fucking everybody!
Why? We're all makin'
so much fuckin' money, you see?
That's the truth!
It's been goin' on for fuckin' centuries!
Oh, fuck!
Were you aware Mike Acosta was
salting the Washoe core samples?
No.
You had no knowledge Mike Acosta
was perpetrating a fraud?
No.
You were not in collusion with
Mike Acosta on the Kencana gold strike?
No, I fuckin' thought
I won I won the lottery.
Did you profit
from the Kencana fraud?
No.
Did anyone close to you profit?
My friends lost money.
My neighbors lost money.
Me?
I lost everything.
You know what the truth of it is, hm?
I never really cared
about the money.
I cared about gold.
It's different, Jennings.
It's fucking different!

Mr. Kenny Wells.
You are free to go.
Well, looky there!
Somebody believes me.
I wouldn't go overboard.
In fact, I wouldn't leave the state...
...or start buying new stuff
or chartering any more jets.
I gotta sneak by the guy at the Front Desk
'cause I can't pay the hotel bill.
I can't be a party to that information.
Good luck, Mr. Wells.
We'll be keeping an eye on you.
What are you gonna do now, Wells?
Hey, Kenny!
I'm still worried about that
mulberry over the back fence.
Yeah, I know, Hart.
It's good to see you.
Good to see you too, Kenny.
Can I come in?
You want coffee?
Yeah, sure.
The place looks great.
So do you, Kay.
I made curtains.
My fabric.
Some stuff came for you,
some mail.
