"The very fact that the commandment says "do not kill"
makes us aware and convinced that we are descended
from an unbroken chain of generations of assassins for
whom the love of murder was in their blood,
as it is perhaps in ours too"
Welcome!
- Hello!
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Hi Neil!
How's it going Neil? You've forgotten
your old friends since living in New York.
Obviously I'd like to come home more often. No Julie?
Yes, especially ifWall Street were here.
But I don't have time to play the tourist.
Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight.
Seems he's willing to buy that lot of stocks
which you told me about yesterday.
I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to go home with you.
You know, it's very important. I'll call you a taxi.
Don't worry, I can get one myself.
Excuse me if we steal your husband
just a few metres into Austria.
I'm not a boring wife.
The extremely important things first.
Kramorstrasse 25.
What's going on?
Good evening.
- Documents, please.
- Here, take it.
I'm sorry, madam. It's just a formality.
What's this about?
Awoman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport.
Another woman killed?
Yes, and razor-slashed again. You can go.
This story is becoming an obsession with the publicity
in the papers and on tv about that crazy maniac.
Yes, they mentioned it in the States too.
They should bring back the death, they should do it!
Then that people would meet the end they deserve.
130 schillings.
- Please keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back Mrs Wardh.
- Antonio, it's you.
A pleasure to see you again, madam.
Everything's in order with the apartment.
Has anyone come in within the last few minutes?
No, madam. Were you expecting someone?
The maid comes tomorrow. I'll take care of the bags.
Thank you.
- Mrs Wardh?
- Yes?
For you. The porter asked me to deliver the luggage.
Leave them here.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
The worst part of you is the best thing you have and will
always be mine. Jean.
Yes I understand, Neil. At least try to pick me up
not too late though. No! I'm not angry
even though Carroll calls me 'Widow Wardh'.
You've only stayed with me one night
in the three days we've been here.
Come quickly, alright? Bye.
Julie, you can finally stop whining about the old man.
Look what I've brought you:
It's fantastic news fresh from Australia.
You wouldn't believe it.
George! Tell him something about uncle.
To be honest, I was fond of old uncle.
Uncle croaked in the end and left
a nice nest-egg for me and him.
We're the sole heirs.
You're family?
Yes.
At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney.
Uncle's dead without a will and the
young lady and I are the sole heirs.
What should I say? Condolences or congratulations?
Just say: Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
Very good. Shall we drink something to celebrate?
- Our meeting?
- No, to uncle's death.
Without which I'd never have met you.
Oh, right.
Julie, please don't cheat the most
handsome cousin I have, alright?
A Martini rosso for me.
- Are your clothes really made of paper?
- Underneathas well?
They're real, you innocent.
- What would you say about having a look?
- Lets give them a tug.
It's true, they're made of paper.
Carroll! Why didn't you say Jean was here as well?
He really pestered me about when you'd be back.
I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway.
Why does it matter to you?
- I'm going.
- Why, Julie?
- Because I am.
- Julie!
Wait.
- Leave me alone.
- I'll take you home in my car.
No, go away.
Why?
Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common.
I'm out of it, and now you make me sick.
Leave me alone!
Julie!
No, please.
Let him go.
You don't know Jean.
He likes hurting people.
What's up?
Aterrible nightmare
but it's over so don't worry.
Julie tell me the truth.
What's wrong? Is it that man?
- Bye.
- Bye!
Next time don't wear paper, come in your birthday suit.
- Funny! Goodbye.
...Bye!
Goodbye!
Wait a minute! Give it to me.
No parking zone, obstructing traffic. You'll pay now?
No, for god's sake, we collect them.
Thanks.
Here it is.
There are more than a thousand policemen in this town!
I want all their autographs!
It's not that easy, you know.
You're completely mad!
Why? Seem strange to you?
I once went to bed with someone who collected
ladies underwear. I realised he only wanted
to be with me to steal my knickers.
Hey!
Give me the paper, will you?
- Here.
- Take it.
Thanks.
Let me have a look. Another woman murdered.
We should be grateful to this maniac
for eliminating our competition.
They always write the same stuff
and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it.
How I envy you, Carroll
you're always so relaxed and cheerful.
No Julie
you just take the best wherever you find it.
A little here, a little there
and avoid thinking the worst.
I married Neil to finish with Jean.
Neil seemed so wise and calm.
But now I'm not so sure.
Neil's your husband, dear.
You can't expect to have everything from one man.
Carroll! Please...
The fact that you put someone between you and Jean
is already really important
Yes I know, but maybe
I've got to escape from myself.
Jean would never accept not seeing me again
because he can't stand losing.
Excuse me, madam. There's a gentleman waiting for you
I put him in the living room.
I don't want to see anyone.
He asked for your husband. I told him he was out
but he wanted to wait to speak to you.
Come on! Who are you scared of?
If it's Jean we'll throw him out.
Come on, it'll be fun for me
Hello.
Look who it is, the handsome cousin.
My husband's not at home.
I'm sorry, Julie. But Carroll told me your husband
is an expert in money problems.
I'd like to get his advice.
Yes, I see.
But I'm sorry, my husband's not here.
I'm glad, really...
To be honest it was just an excuse to see you again.
One definitely can't deny your quality of sincerity.
We interrupted our celebratory drink so I don't want
to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can.
Listen, my handsome cousin.
Given the time, if you want to court her
I recommend continuing over a steak.
Mr...
Call me George.
Don't worry
you'll get a chance to speak to my husband
alright?
Yes
but it's you who should be worrying.
I like bothering women
even when their husbands are around.
Shall we go, Julie?
In any case
thanks, handsome cousin, for the lunch invitation.
For god's sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's.
They serve mustard which swells your tongue.
Why did you treat him like that?
Because I wanted to!
People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves.
If I were you, I'd do it
cousin or not.
Lets go and eat.
I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter. I had three tables left
but a gentleman has just booked them.
So we'll have to starve.
Why?
The mustard's excellent here
doesn't burn the tongue at all. Want some?
What a shame it's full.
But it isn't, I've booked three tables.
We can choose: Here, here, or down there.
- Did I make a mistake?
- If it's that important to you.
Yes, it is.
I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard.
Well, cancel the other two tables.
- Here alright?
- No, the other one's be tter.
The usual for me.
What Carroll's having is fine for me.
So, that's three of what Carroll's having.
This way you'll occasionally
think of me when eating an apple.
The forbidden fruit.
For you I'll do...
...nothing at all!
You've got it all wrong, dear.
It's always been Eve who should offer the apple.
Excuse me, Miss Baxter.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'll be right back.
Maybe Carroll's right.
What's this? Does it mean you want to eat me?
No
it means I've already eaten you.
You'll discover I'm hard to digest.
I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off.
In any case you're happier alone with your apples.
Oh, Carroll!
I'll phone you. Bye!
I can take you wherever you want.
To a taxi, thank you.
So you're used to having your own way, aren't you?
You've finally got it.
Where are we going?!
It's a surprise.
Take me home at once!
Later, Julie, later!
- I told you to take me...
- Relax.
I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear!
Take me home now!
Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart!
I kept my promises, didn't I?
I'll say you did!
I think I should apologise.
Ljudged you wrongly.
No, no! You were right about me.
But it's hard to resist so much.
Thanks anyway...
it's been a nice afternoon. I really needed it.
Bye!
Hello?
Julie? Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you?
Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous.
Some words aren't used any more.
I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it.
I couldn't possibly want anything else from you.
Please leave me alone.
George?!
Don't be offended
but I don't want to see you again
because today... because I like you.
You mustn't phone me again. Never again.
Alright, Julie.
I won't phone again if that's what you want.
How did you get in?!
By the door, it was open.
Why are you...
I wanted to tell you again, Julie:
I really like you
and I'm not used to hiding my intentions.
George I beg you
don't complicate my life.
Don't you understand?!
I'm not the woman you met today.
I know nothing about you, nor do I want to.
For me you're fine as you are.
Come on, lets go into my place.
No, not now.
Let me go.
If you want
if you want.
I'll take you home.
What's wrong?
I'm scared!
Scared of what?!
Take me away, George.
- Where?
- Wherever you want!
It's not a palace, is it?
But it's good enough for me.
I practically only come here
to sleep.
They are for Mrs Wardh.
Thank you.
I know you're trying to escape me... but your vice is
a room locked from the inside and only I have the key.
Who's the admirer?!
Anonymous.
I'd like to think it was you, but... they don't deal in
these items on the stock exchange, do they?
Julie, what's the matter?
Nothing
You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong.
If you feel uncared for
or you need something
we should talk.
No, I don't need anything.
Hello?
Mrs Julie Wardh?
Yes. Who is it?
I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful
lover with very interesting perversions which I'm
sure go unsuspected even by your honest husband.
Isn't that true?
Stop talking nonsense. Who is this?
That's not important, whereas I think
you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh.
I want twenty thousand schillings to not tell your
husband about your affection for George Corot.
It's Jean. It's you, I know it! It's Jean isn't it?!
Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the
South entrance to Palmenhaus. Remember:
Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings.
But...
I didn't know what to do.
When I saw that black car I was scared
it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's.
Naturally. You wanted to go to bed with him
and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse.
Please, Carroll.
Well, maybe
it was as you said.
Anyway there's still the problem
of the phone call.
It was Jean?
Who knows? Have you watched the tv?
They talked about that maniac. The last of his victims
was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party...
Could it be Jean?
He's got a black car too.
Carroll
please stop it.
I was joking.
He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't.
What was his voice like on the phone?
Well... I've already told you.
It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice.
Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice
you'd have recognized him.
It must be Jean. He's the type.
I'm sorry but I don't see the problem. If you like
George you can forget about both Jean and Neil.
So what if Neil finds out?
I think he's a modern intelligent man.
Everything's simple for you.
While I don't know what George is for me,
I know what I was for him.
I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have
his number, and I haven't heard from him.
And I don't want Neil to find out this way.
He really doesn't deserve it.
Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples.
If you want his number I'll give it to you.
Neil's had you in his bed for a year. Don't you think
that's enough to make up for the heartache?
When you talk like that I want to slap you.
But what do you expect? It's the way of the world.
Don't even bother about it,
I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear.
In any case you mustn't go to that appointment.
Where did he say?
At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset
alone and with twenty thousand schillings.
I'll go.
You?
No
it could be dangerous.
And I don't want you involved anymore.
Don't worry
I'll enjoy it. And you'll see it's definitely Jean
and then I'll laugh in his face.
But if it's not Jean.
If it's someone else?
Who?
Maybe the sadist in the papers?
Then that means I'm in grave danger
because I am a bit of a whore.
You joke about everything.
Had breakfast yet?
Well come on...
there's a bar downstairs which will make you forget
all about diets. Come on, and stop making that face!
There's the start!
The competitors immediately engage in a fight...
...and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122.
...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin.
We're closing!
We're closing at sunset!
We're closing!
Excuse me
I had an appointment at the South entrance
to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings.
Over there
but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside.
They're about to close the gates now, so be quick.
- Thank you.
- Good eveni ng.
Help!
Help!
No!
What's going on?!
- Who was screaming!?
- There...
Look over there!
Can you tell us anything?
No, I didn't see anything.
Ljust heard that poor girl shouting. She'd asked me
where the Palmenhaus South entrance was.
She had an appointment. I don't know anything else.
These little animals are my only friends, inspector.
Much less repugnant than certain people I know.
Listen...
it's been said that you've been
Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time.
It's very important for us to know
everything there is to know about her
and the people she associated with.
Please follow me to the police station
I need to continue to interrogate you.
Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages.
So...
shall we go?
Lets go.
Is all this really necessary?
So, madam...
is this the man you spoke to us about?
Yes.
Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for?
You flatter me Julie.
Do you really think I'm capable of
cutting a lot of women's throats?
Yes, you could be.
And though it might seem silly, he has a black car
like the one described in the papers.
You're incredibly amusing.
But it was you who sent me those notes.
What notes?
The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship.
That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts,
hoping she'd remember the good times,
and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter.
I hate you.
The only thing I can't stand is indifference.
Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent
like love, only more so.
Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call
and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place
thinking that you were dealing with your friend...
Was it that man's voice on the phone?
It was disguised, it could have been anyone.
But Carroll told me it must have been Jean.
A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice.
Yes...
but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town
while someone was cutting your friend's throat.
That's the way it is, I'm afraid.
Listen...
why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi?
You're a dirty coward.
You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car,
but she's always had a weakness for blood.
Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man.
You're a...
...person you were keen on for over two years.
That's enough!
I'm not interested in your theories.
Fine.
Can I go?
- I've got something to do.
- Of course.
You can both go.
Bring the other one in. What's his name?
George Corot.
They called you as well?
Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you.
George Corot!
I've got to see you. See you at my place at five.
Julie, at last!
I'm really tired Neil...
Let me speak to your husband now
then we'll go away.
Away from this city, from everything.
No, George, not now.
Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer.
It was foolish to meet today.
I could be being watched.
You've told me there's already someone who knows...
but do you realise that
it should have been you instead of Carroll?
So what?
You can't hide forever.
Does living mean so little to you?
I don't know, George.
If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all.
Please, they can see us here!
I'll take you home.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Neil!
Neil!
Julie!
The elevator was always busy
so I had to take the stairs. Good evening.
Good evening.
Julie...
where have you been? What happened?
Someone in the garage tried to kill me with a razor.
Was it Jean?
Did you see him? Was it him?
I don't know. He was dressed in black, it was dark...
I don't know!
Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers.
Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean.
Neil!
What do you want to do?
Lets call the police.
Where does he live?
There's only one thing to do with people like that.
You mustn't take any risks for me.
You're my wife now, and that's all that matters.
Tell me where he is.
I'll go with you.
Alright, come with me.
Wait for me here.
Neil!
I told you to stay in the car!
No, I'm coming with you.
There are no lights on.
Nobody's there
lets go.
There's a camera on the ground over there...
a photo's been taken.
Julie! Julie, relax Julie!
Neil
Neil!
Jean's car has gone!
Adam and Eve lost paradise because they wanted to know
too much.
Julie, wake up Julie!
I've developed that photo. Look!
Recognise him?
It's the man in the garage.
Yes, it's him!
Who?
Don't know. He was dressed
like that, with those glasses.
Now we know it wasn't Jean.
Which means...
he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll?
I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover.
Obviously there's someone else.
Oh, Neil!
Where are you going?
I'm scared.
I'm going to the police.
This photo could be useful to the inspector.
Hello?
George, is that you?
Why did you take so long to call me?
I'll tell you when I see you.
Come and get me, I can't carry on.
Come and get me, and we'll leave.
We'll go to some quiet place
as far away as possible.
Anywhere.
Okay.
Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you.
I'll take you to Spain.
I know a little place
that'll make you forget everything.
For Neil.
When did she leave?
Just before noon.
Bye, dear. I'll call you when I get back from Sydney.
Okay. Bye!
Hello?
Hello. How are you?
No, I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll be back in a week.
Then I'll get the A122 toTokyo.
No. I'm not tired.
You don't sleep with the time zone changes.
The light's gone out...
it'll come back on.
Alright!
Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir.
Will a kangaroo do?
Why, what do you want?
I promise we'll meet again when I get back.
Bye!
No, no!
Help!
Help!
Has something happened?
No, no. Nothing.
Why did you run away?
I wanted to get some sun.
Carry on thinking about your prey if you want.
I've seen one who's more attractive.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
Viennese homicidal maniac dead.
George!
Yes?
Look, they've found the maniac.
He was killed by the girl he was attacking.
So it's all over, for good.
So it's all over, for good.
Lets think about us.
I'm hungry.
I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you
go and change some money. We've almost run out.
You take my car and I'll get a taxi.
Bye!
Bye!
Bye.
- Take them.
- Thanks.
These are for you.
For me?!
Yes, that gentleman gave them to me...
he was there just now.
He was there just now.
He must have left.
Since the living don't give flowers to the dead,
the dead give them to the living. Jean.
George.
George.
What's going on?
What's wrong? Do you feel sick, madam?
What's wrong? Do you feel sick, madam?
No, no!
Madam...
Julie!
Julie.
Julie answer me. It's George.
Julie, what happened?
Julie!
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?
- Where can I find a doctor?
- Down there, at the pha rmacy.
Thanks.
This will make you sleep for a few hours.
What's wrong with her?
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion.
When I left her down in the village she was fine.
Well something happened
maybe she got a fright.
Know what you can do? I'll give you a number!
Here it is.
Doctor Arbe. He's my friend, a good neurologist.
Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour.
Thank you. Can I leave her here
while I go down into the village to call?
Don't worry. She'll sleep peacefully until this evening.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary. I know the road.
- I'll come with you.
- Not necessary. I know the road.
No, it's impossible. I've still got two appointments
and I don't have a car. Tomorrow.
And I don't have a car. Tomorrow.
Please, doctor. I'll pick you up.
Alright, in an hour.
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
- How much?
- 80 pesetas.
George...
George!
George!
So I brought her here
hoping she'd feel better far away from it all.
Then... I don't know what happened today.
You mentioned blood earlier.
She didn't say anything to me
but I understood something straight away.
She was with that man I told you about for a while.
He dominated her.
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
Blood definitely has a strange effect on her
it both attracts and repels her.
Listen
it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor.
It'll be easier.
Julie!
There's a smell of gas.
Quick, in the kitchen!
The door's locked. Help me!
Julie...
Turn the gas off and try not to breathe!
Open the window!
Lets take her there.
No pulse any more.
Call to quickly send an equipped ambulance.
- Is there any hope?
- I told you to go
and call the hospital. Get on with it!
Inspector
Doctor Arbe is here
Very well, you can go.
Mr Wardh, this is Doctor?
He did everything to try and save your wife
but it was already too late.
And I'm telling you it isn't suicide.
My wife was scared of dying.
The room was locked and sealed from the inside!
It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me.
Anyway, this man's guilty.
I want to go now.
Of course, Mr Wardh.
The funeral?
The body needs to be available to the authorities for
a few days then you can send someone to collect it.
George!
You're late.
I'll pay now.
It's too hot for me here.
A plane is leaving for Rio! I don't want to miss it.
Who are you scared of?
Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna,
and nobody saw you here.
If the police discover one day that the maniac didn't
kill Carroll your alibi's already been checked out.
Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive.
Even if some cop unveils our tricks...
you're out of it.
Your passport says you're called John McDonald,
and Julie never met you.
But you've got a cast iron alibi too.
If they don't get me you're fine.
They won't get you.
Julie Wardh committed suicide.
The money, now!
Okay.
Now you really are dead.
A first-rate suicide for love.
Have they paid up?
Not yet.
They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days.
I spoke to New York.
Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet
and avoid bankruptcy. And you?
No problems.
Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir.
We've got to be careful. If someone sees us together...
Why?
We're husband and lover united in memories.
There's no risk.
And there never was.
I told you, didn't I?
The best time to eliminate someone is when the police
are hunting a homicidal maniac. We can help each other.
You eliminate the cousin
and I eliminate the wife.
They're blaming it all on him...
even though that idiot was caught
before we finished the job.
The suicide idea worked perfectly.
Talking of which, our black suits?
Burned
completely destroyed. There's no evidence any more.
Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out.
I burnt mine.
Why? They're almost new.
Did you like my line at the police station?
"Anyway, this man's guilty!"
And how did poor old Jean take it?
Like a kick in the guts!
He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it.
And if the Spanish police find him?
They'll found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide.
It's crucial that the insurance claim is above suspicion
or they'll drag it out forever.
What do you think they could suspect?
Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were
miles away. And it was a clear-cut case of suicide.
Julie!
That woman!
It's her, I'm sure!
What are you talking about?
I only saw her briefly...
it was her, Julie!
If you're starting to hallucinate
already we'll end up badly.
No, it was her
I clearly saw her. Lets go back.
You're crazy.
There was just a resemblance.
...no!
- I've never heard of th e dead hitch-hiking.
Alright
just a resemblance.
So what?
Lets have a look.
We're shafted!
Careful!
It's over, Julie.
Call and get them to send a breakdown crane
I'd never have reopened this investigation
if our doctor hadn't given us about the different
technique used by Carroll Baxter's murderer.
And there would have been three more criminals.
I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them.
In thinking you were dead they felt safe
and they betrayed themselves.
But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe's who save you.
I'm leaving you in good hands.
You saved my life
but I feel dead anyway.
You'll be able to forget everything.
Time is the best healer, Julie.
Good luck!
