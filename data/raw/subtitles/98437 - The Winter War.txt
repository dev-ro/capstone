THIS MOVIE IS DEDICATED
TO THE FINNS IN THE WINTER WAR
Try to look after Paavo.
I'll try.
If anyone can look after each other.
Who knows, they might let us go...
reach an agreement.
We could have walked.
-Nobody walks to war from our house.
Starring
Taneli Mäkelä
In Pekka Parikka's film
THE WINTER WAR
Screenplay adapted by
Antti Tuuri and Pekka Parikka
They promised us proper gear.
-The army doesn't have any.
Martti, you and Paavo
only need footrags and underwear.
We got those, too.
-Take a pair anyway.
I'd prefer a fur hat like that.
Too goddamn tight.
-These are all too small.
They should've given me a cannon.
-What for?
To have a bit fun.
-Wrong time for fun now.
Korpela, it's your squad's turn.
Okay, guys, now try to line up.
I should've joined the Civil Guard.
Look at the stuff they gave me.
Only a cockade and a belt.
Makes a man look like a fool.
Here, Jussi, have a smoke.
-I'm not here to learn to smoke.
You can learn it in the bargain.
You Hakala boys look real warlike.
-That's where we're going.
The radio said
Moscow negotiations are going well.
Not our radio.
You got a radio at your place?
You can listen to it anywhere.
Well, old school buddy?
Damn, that's my bottle.
What's going on here?
Russkies better watch out.
Our guys are pretty wild already.
Shouldn't start boozing.
-What if they drank your booze?
I never touch the stuff.
-There go the Sippola brothers!
Think we'll have to eat hardtack.
-Food's not the first thing in war.
Jesus! In the Civil War of 1918,
when the bullets were flying -
food wasn't foremost in our minds.
The situation is serious.
But this is not war.
We are going on maneuvers.
Maneuvers are something
we all know very well.
As for the negotiations, 
I know as much as you...
The Russians are demanding
Finnish territory.
They are now discussing
how big a part of Finland they want  -
and what right
they have to claim it.
They can demand all they want,  -
but taking it will not be easy.
At ease.
Let's eat before we go.
Where are we going?
Don't win too soon,
I want my share too.
Don't talk rubbish.
Try to be a man here.
It's good we got the harvest in.
Paavo,
you're the boss now with Jussi.
I guess that's it.
Where are you going?
-To Seinäjoki.
Will the Russians attack?
-You never know.
Come on, now, don't cry.
But war's coming.
Russians are terrible.
Who can tell for sure?
-It's so awful...
There's nothing to worry about.
-What if they kill you?
How could they kill me,
of all people?
It's so hard to say anything...
Look after your mother.
Leave it be, we'll be back soon.
I've been thinking about
what happened to Estonia and others.
Try to save Finland
from the same fate.
We're not going to war.
-It's just maneuvers, papa.
Just remember what I told you.
Well, goodbye.
Here come the Sippola brothers.
You homesick already, Paavo?
Who was that girl crying back there?
Don't you know our Anna?
Good for a girl: "Anna, I wanna".
-Leave him alone.
Anything good in there?
-I don't think so.
You got my bottle?
-We drank your bottle.
That's my bottle.
Your bottle's under the school's lavatory.
I don't know about
the Russians demands -
but I guess it's land they want.
Half a county in Karelia, islands,
and the Hanko peninsula.
Kind of voracious, aren't they?
Nothing's enough for them.
Don't they have enough land already.
All the way to Siberia.
They better leave our lands alone.
The only land we'll give them
is their burial pit.
Have a drink, Pentti.
-Never been greedy for the stuff.
Paavo, what are you sighing?
Leaving's hard for a single man...
gets homesick.
Me, I thank my luck
for getting away.
We must get a field kitchen.
I won't steal it.
Over and out.
They say we've received one.
-Where can it be?
I haven't seen one.
-Did it turn into an airplane?
Can I ask something?
Go ahead.
Can Paavo and I
be in the same squad?
I promised to look after him.
I guess it's OK.
-I don't know if I can, though...
Rinta, is younger Hakala in 3rd squad?
-Yeah, that's right.
What about Martti?
-He's in 1st.
Put Paavo in 1st, too.
What's the difference?
-Makes a difference to me.
So who do we take out?
-I don't know.
Just keep your papers in order.
Well, boys, what's your battle plan?
Sir, we shoot if they start coming.
Every man has his own shooting sector,
Colonel, Sir.
How are you Kauhava boys feeling?
-Just waiting for war, Sir.
Aren't we old pals with Hakala....
from the Mäntsälä uprising.
I think we met there, too.
Bigger things are in store this time.
-What sort of things?
Let's wait and see.
You think they put Erkkilä in the same squad to get at us.
-I guess so.
They say he's our half-brother....
his mother was our maid.
I suppose it's definite.
Well, you said brothers
can help each other in a bad spot.
They were harping on it in school.
Sweden will help us if Russia attacks.
-I don't believe it.
Who says that?
-Somebody heard it on the radio.
What help would the Swedes be?
The Russkies won't attack
if they know the Swedes are on our side.
The Russkies don't dread the Swedes.
I'd visit home, if I knew we had time.
Paasikivi is back from Moscow.
-Only to get further instructions.
Anyway, he's back.
A quick trip home.... I wonder.
-No use asking me.
I'll come and be your son in-law.
-I've got no daughters.
Hello, Rajala.
-Hello?
Don't you know how to salute?
Let's try it again.
Are you serious?
-Let's try it. Do it again.
Do it yourself.
The Russians say they want
to secure Leningrad -
and that's why they want the land.
They don't trust us.
But we don't trust them, either.
So it's reciprocal.
Eat, boys, eat.
Come and help me, boys.
-Us?
Help me with something.
-With what?
We have something for us.
Let's go get it.
Hey, where are you taking it?
-We're taking what's ours.
This is not yours.
Beware Sergeant,
how do you talk to your superiors.
Fuck you, Jutila,
you won't take our kitchen.
Martti, go get a horse.
What do you think you're doing?
-Taking away our kitchen.
How do you know it's yours?
-It says so in the papers.
Can I see the papers?
This is the number of our kitchen,
the same number as this one.
It's a bit unclear, the number.
-Yes, I noticed it.
It took a while to find it.
Don't they know a dead body
without dog tags.
What if a grenade takes your head off?
-The tags go with it.
Or if a bullet hits you in the face,
so bad that even your pals don't recognize you?
You wouldn't be any worse off.
-Don't talk rot, this is regulations.
Finest thing I ever had round my neck.
-Or will have.
I guess this means we're going,
as they give out death tags.
Now, come on, men.
Jussi,
take a good look at my dog tags -
...in case they shoot my head off.
I'll know you, Ylli.
How, if I don't have a head?
-By the smell.
And lead us not in to temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For Thy is the kingdom,
the power and the glory. Amen.
May the Lord be with you.
Jesus says;
come, for everything is made ready.
The body of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.
The blood of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.
In fields cleared from forests deep
A nation lives, brave and free
The vow they made sacred and true
Gone is slavery, or go we will, too
Like our fathers have gone before us
Dying for freedom is pure and true
Boys from Ylihärmä can sing!
-Silence in the line!
Why aren't we singing?
-Singing's by separate orders only.
Somppi, where are they taking us?
-I have no idea.
Ask, you are an officer.
We're headed south.
But nobody on this train knows where we're going.
The engineer should know.
-Go ask him.
We can go to Kivennapa, for all I care.
-That's possible, too.
The radio says that Paasikivi
is going back to Moscow.
It's time he raised some hell
for the Russkies.
He's a bit too old for that.
He'll find it easier to negotiate,
knowing we're on our way...
Russkies will soon know taht the Finns
mean a real thing.
Get some sleep.
Can't bear to sleep, corporal.
Heroic deeds await us.
This is the turning point.
We can go either east or south.
Or we can stay here.
-I won't stay here.
Boys, come in.
You can't leave the train!
Arvi, come on!
A man can still take a leak.
Nobody from our squad is there,
are they?
Boys, come in here.
Matti also.
Come back safe!
Well, here we come, the enemy!
-But where?
Who cares?
Away from home, anyway.
Or does Paavo miss his mother?
We didn't fight because of wrath
But the glorious memories took us
Our national heroes
And songs of our fathers'
Shut up, you youth club boys.
-I'm not one of them.
You don't learn this
at a youth club.
What's wrong with youth club?
-You should know.
The sons of the heroic folk
Can't lick their chains
They want to rise from the forests
And die on the fields of glory
Don't make a fire here,
the enemy sees it from the air.
I'm going to make some coffee.
-What enemy?
Making a fire is strictly forbidden.
-Just stop whooping.
Might be better not to light a fire.
You boys know nothing about art of war.
First thing you do is build a fire.
That's most important thing in war.
Officers might not like it.
-Is that what you're scared of?
I'm not scared of anything.
-Be afraid when you hear guns.
Don't be scared of officers,
or a little fire.
I've been there.
I see you boys have a fire going.
-Thought we might brew some coffee.
Good idea.
We may have to march all night to the border.
Yes, Ylli, here we go again...
like last time.
Like in the Civil War.
-This might be a little different.
Where are they taking us?
-To the butchers.
Keep on walking, boys.
-You'll learn this soon:
In the war you never know,
you just go where they tell you.
District Chief,
let me try how it feels to ride that horse.
Try to learn to call me Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, sir, may I ride on your horse?
-Go ahead.
My feet are killing me.
-Should've taken the old boots.
I thought I'd look better in new ones.
This is a mean place to sit
if they start shooting at you.
That's what I think.
-You fall like a pheasant from a tree.
Should we sing a fine song?
-We can pass the time without.
Let the Ylihärmä boys sing.
We're looking for war glory.
Alert! Alert!
Don't blow that whistle again
as long as we're here.
Thank you for a fine ride.
Your horses aren't used to ships,
I see.
This is the first time
I've seen a ship on a river.
Where are you boys from?
-From Ostrobothnia.
Weren't you lucky to get here!
I'd rather be home.
-Come on, now!
Come with us to Käkisalmi!
You won't miss your home there!
Funny kind of milk cart you have.
How about your milk?
-We take it along the road.
Funny to see the whole army running
because of a ship whistle.
What's this quiet little girl's name?
It's Aino.
-Well Aino, coming home?
I see.
Aino is a bit shy, isn`t she?
-She misses her fiance.
Where is he? Run off with another?
Our men went to Rautu
to fortify the border.
Paavo, let's go brew some coffee.
Scarves from Paris, pure silk.
Come'n buy one for your sweetheart.
As you were.
-Want some coffee?
I just had some.
-Suit yourself, then.
The regiment has decided
not to draw the first pay -
but to leave it to the Army.
We've all seen the condition
of our supplies and tools.
The Army would buy guns and such.
What do you think?
Has everybody decided?
-Yes, that's what I hear.
I'm in.
That's all right.
Where are you going?
-To look around.
Careful,
or they'll shoot you as a spy.
Paavo is spying
into the morale of civilians.
Don't go without your weapon.
-He sure has one.
This is a man's thing to do.
We bought stone drills
with our own money -
since the regiment didn't have any.
It was for a good cause.
I thought our ploughman
might be hungry.
Soil should be turned before winter.
My husband didn't have time.
He had to go off to Rautu.
I like doing it. Helps pass the time.
I don't know how to pay you.
-Don't need payment.
I got enough land to know
what it means to turn the soil.
You spoiled your Sunday.
-Not much else to do on a Sunday.
We were just talking.
-About our Fatherland?
Come and sit down.
-I'd better not.
Just for a little while.
My fiance is building fortifications.
I can't do this to him.
I'm good enough to go to war and die,
but not good enough to sit next to.
We might leave tomorrow.
Come and sit down.
I can't stand here all night.
My legs are going numb.
Anybody home?
Evening, I hope I'm not disturbing.
-No, no... not at all.
I just wanted to ask if you still had those pies to sell.
Or some bread...
Seems to me like
the pie-sharing happened already.
No, no... wait, I'll get some.
Maybe I could warm these a little.
-They're OK like they are.
Martti's not too fussy.
How much are they?
-Let's say they're for plowing the field.
You're quite a pussy chaser.
-You wanted some, too.
I'm a married man.
-What am I?
You know best.
-We just listened to the radio and...
What did they say?
Paasikivi returned from Moscow...
didn't agree to anything...
Russkies better be careful
with their demands...
We might have a say about it, too.
Quite a patriotic moment.
That's what I said.
Lapua boys told me
that America promised -
to help us if Russia attacks.
That'd be a good thing.
-It's too far for them to come.
Wouldn't take long by ship.
-It's not so quick. I've been to America.
If Russkie attacks,
we don't need any America.
We only need Laurila's Regiment.
-Laurila told not to spread rumors.
This is no rumor.
Lapua boys heard it on the radio.
I heard that Sweden won't let anybody march
through their territory.
The horsemen said so at Battalion.
Hakala here ploughed our fields.
-Thank you for that.
No need.
I wanted to make myself useful.
Well, I thank you anyway.
-They've all been so helpful.
I find this Army way insane.
We went to Rautu
and you've been here.
There is no sense in this.
I would prefer to stay home.
Write your address, when you know.
I'll write to you.
I'll write. And remember.
You have girls crying after you
here and there.
It's the common cause.
The country needs new soldiers.
-Look who's talking.
Half platoon!
Alert
Half platoon!
It's the Russians now.
They're trying to kill you.
Bear that in mind.
Take your positions!
Find your own sector
and wait for the command.
Don't shoot on your own.
Isn't Ylli part of this maneuver?
I've practiced so much,
I'm waiting for the real thing.
You boys
practice as much as you want.
I thought you went on leave.
-As you see.
I thought you'd get leave
for your own baby's christening.
They didn't let me go...
Asked me what I should do there,
now that the baby is already born.
Shut up! News!
The Soviet Union has been forced to cancel
the treaty of non-aggression.
The sergeant-major got ten days.
-How did he wrangle that?
His wife died.
Paavo, wouldn't a leave be nice,
now that the skirts have gone...
We might as well head off somewhere.
How come you're back so soon?
When I got to the station
they told me all leave was cancelled.
You don't say.
Russians crossed the border
at Metsäpirtti and Rautu six o'clock.
It's the real thing now.
Should I wake the boys?
-That's the orders.
Good morning,
men from the Ostrobothnia.
Good morning, Colonel.
Eyes front!
Order arms!
At ease!
Like so many times in the past -
the men of Finland
must once more take up arms -
as our old enemy, Russia,
tries to invade our country.
We did not want war.
We did want peace.
But peace is not
what we got from Stalin...
or from Otto Ville Kuusinen
whom we threw out of this country back in 1918.
The Army has shown to the Russians
that this is no parade march.
And now, on our independence day,
it is our turn.
Not an inch will we yield!
Three cheers for the Fatherland,
for the Finnish army -
and Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim!
Ylli get down, they're firing at us!
If it whines, it always misses.
If it's for you, it just whispers.
Follow me, if we have to go.
Must be nasty in the front lines.
Sure don't feel like going our there
with an empty stomach.
Where is Somppi?
-Over there.
We have to prepare for a counterstrike.
It's coming soon!
Don't all stand together. Spread out!
This is no kids' game.
Ylli went in one go.
How did he get it?
-Shrapnel through the back of the head.
When it's for you, it just whispers...
He didn't hear
machine guns sing in this war.
Did Ylli get hit?
Did you sleep at all?
-I just woke up.
Should we build a fire?
-It's forbidden.
We'll freeze to death.
-There are many ways to die in the war.
I've been thinking
about the Alanen family -
with Ylli coming home
in a casket.
His wife is our kin.
-Ylli was my second cousin.
Anybody hit?
I don't think so.
What did they tell you?
-Changeover tonight.
You stay here, Paavo.
What do I do?
-Just shoot it they start coming.
Is this tough?
-Aren't you the tough clan?
I mean, is this a bad spot?
Nothing but bad spots here, pal.
You got grease in your rifle breech?
It's well greased.
-Wipe it dry.
Should be a field there,
and the river behind it.
Russians got across the river yesterday.
Pärssinen forest on the left.
Boys from Central Finland
say the Russians start early, like work.
Must be warming up their tank engines.
They're Russians.
Shouldn't we shoot them?
Don't ask me.
Why don't our guns fire?
-Has anybody told them?
Surely they can see.
It was about time.
Jesus, that's no good.
We are damn short of ammunition.
The Russkies are coming!
Are you hit?
-No, just hot.
Martti,
there are too many of them coming.
Why aren't the anti-tank men firing?
-They're bringing the gun.
Soon it'll be too late.
All the phone lines are down,
I sent a man.
Take Ahti's rifle,
he won't be needing it.
Was Ahti hit bad?
-Already dead at the first aid post.
Who, Ahti?
Are they going to kill all our pals?
Are they coming at night?
-Who knows?
Have you stayed awake?
-There's enough noise.
Martti, come with me.
Let's see if the neighbors
had any papers with them.
What papers?
Let's search the pockets of the dead.
They won't come over now?
You won't get shot?
Go through their pockets.
Let's go.
You won't need this.
It is gets any colder,
we'll need dynamite to break up the cheese.
Let Russian artillery do it for us.
Hell of a stink here.
-My hands are covered in blood.
Are you wounded?
-No, it's the Russian I robbed.
The Russians stopped
when we pointed the gun at them.
Don't brag now,
they can come with force.
Damnit, boys, Russians are coming!
They're already in the trench.
In the trench?
How did they get there?
Dug their way last night.
-Are there many of them?
Haven't counted them yet.
We have to drive them out
or kill them right there.
I'll go first and clear the trench.
Paavo, you throw grenades.
Fix bayonets.
Let's give them, boys!
How did you such a blunt bayonet
through a jacket?
I just shoved it
and stabbed for my brother.
Take the breeches from enemy rifles.
They won't jam as easy.
Here they come...
take your positions.
1st Platoon, get to the edge of the world,
one by one.
Do I still have legs?
-One.
1st Squad form a chain!
Paavo don't!
Are you hit bad?
-Just lifted my hand...
Where did it hit?
-It scratched at once.
Did you get it in the head?
-No, just my side, I think.
Jussi! Come and take a look at Paavo!
I wasn't hit in the head.
-Let's bandage it. You'll get home leave.
Soon I can't even see anything.
-Think you can walk?
Nothing wrong with my legs.
Soon as I lifted my arm it scratched my side.
They can't use explosive bullets!
-Go tell them.
I've got the battalion commander's written orders.
About what?
We would've known that anyway.
You stay here,
I'll go to the company.
Did they order you there?
-Told me to drive the Russians back.
I'm going to ask with what.
All right boys,
let's take back our positions.
Try to take a few prisoners.
Aatos and Erkkilä,
grab hand grenades.
1st Platoon,
prepare to counterattack.
Look out!
Why did he do that?
They've been told
that we'll torture and kill them.
We need more men
to dig the trenches open.
I've already ordered reserves
to counterattack.
What were our losses?
-Four dead and six wounded.
I wonder how long they'll try coming straight at us,
standing up?
It's a regulation for them...
They can't change it in a hurry...
Well, Hakala,
how do you like war as job?
The younger Hakala
was wounded today.
Badly hit?
-No.
Just a scratch in the side.
A man won't die by a scratch.
It's our turn for sentry duty.
So watch who you shoot at.
-My bullets are for the Russians.
Hey guys, are you asleep?
Asleep? Us?
Sure looked like it.
-We weren't sleeping.
Go get some sleep in the dugout.
Were we asleep?
All I can hear is the boys digging
and the Russians tanks.
I heard them here already.
-Let's hope that's all we hear.
Don't shoot, they're from 5th Company.
-What are they doing there?
Attacking the woods behind the school.
What's the matter with you?
You'll get yourself killed.
Don't go... stay down....
They'll kill you!
Password!
Pussy.... pussy.
It's hungry.
Pussy, pussy.
I wonder whose cat that is?
-It stayed behind.
A cat does that,
even if the people leave.
Cats grow fond of places,
not people.
You're the cat expert here.
What do you mean?
-You've stroked some pussy on this trip.
Boys are just talking... jealous.
I hope Erkkilä didn't run the wrong way.
-The Russians can have taken him.
This man was found
at battalion headquarters.
Did you get that far?
-He told that all of you have been killed.
Well, we have some still alive.
Sit down.
Come on, now.
-They talked about a court-martial.
I told Erkkilä will come to his senses
when he's back with his own folk.
Jussi,
do you have any medicine for Erkkilä?
Of course.
This will help you.
I see you have yourselves a pet.
Every house needs a cat.
-No rats can pester us.
Some men from the Lieska battalion
will open the trenches tonight.
Try and get some sleep here. Erkkilä, too.
-Yes, sir.
You hold on to this cat.
She purrs so nicely.
What did you give him?
I have nothing but headache pills.
Erkkilä!
Come lie down beside me.
My brothers told me
after the Civil War -
that it's an accident
to get hit by artillery.
Even though the Reds got one jaeger.
In war the thing is machine guns.
Hard to say.
Well, tell me what's the war like.
None of us will come back alive.
That I don't believe.
We got definite information
that our boy Matti -
killed thirty Russkies with his knife
on the very first day.
I haven't heard about it.
-Funny, it's supposed to be a fact.
Russkies aren't within knife's reach.
You quite sure?
-Sure I'm sure.
I don't believe you....
why should they tell me if it wasn't the truth?
I wouldn't know.
They're afraid to talk about it...
It gives a bad picture
of Finnish soldiers -
if the world hears
they're killing with knives...
That might well be.
Let's just hope
he comes home safely.
The boys will have a cold ride.
I suppose they don't freeze.
Give me one, too.
Buy your own,
then you'll know how far your money goes.
