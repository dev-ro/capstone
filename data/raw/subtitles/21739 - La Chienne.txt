Ladies and gentlemen, we are
proud to present...
...a serious social drama...
...proving that vice is always punished.
...ladies and gentlemen
we are proud to present...
...a comedy of manners
with a moral.
What are you doing?
I'm the announcer!
But that's my job!
No, it's mine!
Ladies and gentlemen
pay no attention to them.
The play that follows is
neither comedy nor drama.
It has no moral whatsoever...
...and proves nothing at all.
The characters are neither
heroes nor villains...
...but plain people like you and me
The three main ones are...
HE, SHE... and THE OTHER GUY
...as usual.
HE is a nice, timid chap,
not that young...
...but much too naive.
His culture and sensitivity....
...so far above his milieu...
...makes him look like a perfect fool.
SHE is a creature with
a special brand of charm...
...and a vulgarity all her own.
She is always sincere...
...and she lies all the time.
As for THE OTHER GUY...
...he's just plain Dédé,
nothing more.
And now, ladies and geltlemen,
the show is about to begin!
I am deeply moved to extend you,
upon this happy occasion...
...the respectful contratulations of the entire company...
We are just one big family....
which you manage like a father.
And I can assure you, Mr. Henriot, that
the entire personnel of Henriot & Co...
...lingerie dealer... on whose
behalf I am speaking...
...are proud of this award
...in recognition of your courageous efforts.
Gentlemen, to your health!
As they say in the army,
"bottoms up!"
That's a good one!
Good old Legrand.
Always up to date.
He's the life of the party.
Good idea.  With Legrand,
that will be a scream.
Listen, old chap, the evening
is still young...
...so here's what we decided to do.
He won't do it.
He's too scared of his wife.
No, no... I'd rather go right home.
The little woman gave you
a midnight curfew, huh?
I don't want any trouble at home...
...and I'm not interested
Such crass pleasures are beneath you.
No... I know it's possible to find
nature in a bouquet of faded flowers...
...or the forest in a vial of perfume
or freedom in a few cocktails...
But I feel that some dreams
require solitude
What a wet blanket
you are, Legrand.
At times the illusion of love
may outlast the image of a dingy room...
...but awaken we must.
This is too deep for me.
What counts in life is having fun...
...and to know the right people.
You'd better count me out.
You like to live it up.
I'm not very sociable.
Okay, old boy, do as you please.
But when it comes to quitters,
you take the cake.
I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Andreou, but...
It would have been more
fun with him.
Don't go sulking, 'cause I won't
go for it.
I ain't sulking, Dédé.
Want me to slap you one?
I can tell when you're sulking.
You'll get your money tomorrow.
I need it tonight.
I can't see old Marchal at this hour.
You always got excuses...
Are you hurt?
Forgive me... I was passing by.
You hurt him.
I'll take you home.
We can't just leave him here...
He'll catch pneumonia.
I don't have money for a taxi.
It's your fault.
It's nothing, darling.
The old guy took you by surprise.
We'll take you home.
You'll go to bed... you'll go to
sleep... and you'll be fine.
No, wait here.  I'll be right down.
I'm sick of hanging around
with such a dopey dame.
Either you make out with this
guy, or we're through.
Yes, Dédé, I promise...
if that's what you want.
I bumped into a door.
He's much better.
Which way are you going?
Towards Barbes...
May I come with you?
Of course.  Maybe we
can walk... it's not far.
He's got good manners and
he can be nice when he wants to.
And yet?...
Oh, he knows how to behave
but he gets carried away.
He gets excited, you know
what I mean?
Yes, I know what you mean.
Just yesterday he was wishing
he could buy me pretty dresses.
I wouldn't look so bad then...
You're fine the way you are.
...and he's got talent.  You should
see his imitation of Maruice Chevalier...
...only he hasn't got any connections,
so I've got to help him.
You help him?
Sure... we've been together three years.
That's like being married, ain't it?
Will I see you again?
I'll write you.
Where should I write?
In care of the post office
...Maurice Legrand.
I'm a married man, you see.
Which post office?
Place Vintimille...
Oh, I'm sorry.  How much
do I owe you?
15 francs, Sir!
Are you finished with
all that noise?
Sorry, I was trying to be quiet.
Why are you so late?
It's not late.
I told you to be
in by eleven.
Oh... I was with friends.
The boss made speeches..
and the senator was there.
Is that why you woke me up
with your rotten paintings?
I'm sick of your paintings.
I want you to get those canvasses
out of my apartment.
My visitors think they're
in a junk shop.
I put them away the best I can.
I don't want to see them again,
you hear me?
Get rid of them...
...or I'll send for the junk man.
And I'll give him all those
rotten things to take away.
Painting -- the very idea!
It's my only passion...
Since when do you have passion?
You're the laughing stock of the
neighborhood.  You -- an artist!
No one would have caught my first
husband wasting his time with paints.
Oh, yes... the SERGEANT!
That's right.  The sergeant...
a real man, a hero.
HE was one of those who died
in the war for the likes of you.
That wasn't my fault.
How handsome my Alexis was
in his dress uniform.
Obviously I'm not built
like Alexis Godard.
In any case, you've been warned.
Go to bed because I want my sleep.
You must have made
a lovely couple...
A month later
Here comes the life of the party.
His wife's been beating him.
Leave him alone.
He's of his rocker.
You and Josephine Baker?
Don't make me laugh.
Why not "Old Man Legrand"
and a pretty girl?
What would you have done in my shoes?
Maurice made me leave home
and set up here.
He's the painter I met
when Dédé had fainted...
and we took Dédé home.
And what about Dédé?
He knows all about it, of course.
How could he be jealous
of a guy 42 years old?
Take a look over here.
You sure have a nice view.
He really has been good to you.
he set you up nicely.
Is he very rich?
Oh, he makes plenty... but I have
a feeling he's kind of stingy.
I have all the furniture on credit.
He said he couldn't pay for it all at once.
By the way, did you see the wallpaper?
I chose it with Dédé.  I want
him to feel at home here.
You sure are sweet to him.
Did you see the pictures?
Maurice painted them by hand
...in oil.
His wife didn't want them
in her home...
...so he brought them here.
I'm not much on art, but
they look great to me.
It's a good thing tomorrow he's
bringing the money he promised me.
With all these household expenses...
...the furniture, the rent,
and everything else.
Only I'd better not tell Dédé.
If he knows I got 1,000 francs,
he'll put the bite on me...
...to pay all his debts, and I'll be broke again.
With him it is best that
I am well settled.
Come and look at my bathroom.
My dream!
Oh... you have a vacuum cleaner!
Yeah, it's more hygienic.
And look, it runs on gas
...and it's automatic
Oh, that should be convenient
to do the wash.
You want to take a bath?
You don't mind?
I'll get you a new bar of soap.
And you do love your painter?
I can't say it disgusts me to do it
with Maurice.  It's just nothing.
I relax and think of Dédé.
You go to his house?
Of course not.  He's married
to a colonel's widow.
It doesn't disgust me
as with old Marchal.
He was the hot-blooded kind.
Then why did you do it with him?
I had to, since Dédé was broke.
So, Yvonne... how do you
like my place?
What would you have done
in my place?
My advice is...
break her right away.
And the best way to break here in
is with finesse.
...'specially since you've got yourself
a dame who's certainly no spring chicken.
Don't let her snow you with her
diamonds and her chauffeur.
How do you know all that?
When I see a good looking guy
like you in a fancy car...
...sitting next to an old bag...
...you can tell me
"she's your cousin"...
...and that you've been saving
up to pay for the gas.
I bet you found her
in a dance hall.
That's where you always
find those dames.
Right you are.  But speaking of
advice, just between us...
I know.. you mean Lulu.
You mean she's still kind of dumb.
I could never wise her up
all the way.
If I need dough, I have to rough
her up before she'll go after it.
But with Legrand on the hook,
I'm going to have it easier now.
Who's this Legrand?
The guy I met the other night...
...and he's loaded, pal.  Loaded!
He horned in on my little talk
with Lulu.
He was in a tuxedo... must have
come out of a nightclub.
He must have been dead drunk.
... so he starts to bawl me out.
I throw him a right hook,
and he goes down for the count.
But he gets up and says "okay, okay,
how about a drink?"
And right away we was bosom pals.
Still monkeying around
with those paints?
You were out for a walk, my love?
I don't have time to play around.
I was collecting my dividends.
You mean, "our dividends."
MY dividends.
Nothing here is yours.
OUR dividends.  OURS!  OURS!
Cluttering my house with
your paintings again?
I said get rid of them,
not paint more.
Oh... one picture...
Self portrait again?
Can't you get anyone else to sit?
What did you do with the others?
I sold them to the junk man.
Sold them? I don't believe it.
But I did.  For 100 francs.
And where are those 100 francs?
Give me.
Afraid I'll get into trouble?
Ha, with what I give you
each week...
...and you wasting it on paints
and such?
No sir!  I don't have to worry about you.
It's not like it was with Alexis.
You did have to worry with Alexis.
He was a real man.
A regular lady killer.
That's right, pal.  He's a painter.
He paints pictures and sells them
in America.
Sells as many as he can paint
Hes settin up my Lulu.
That dope wanted to drop him for me,
a pimp.  Can you beat that?
I told her wed see more of each
other this way.
specially since hes married
And when she gets some clothes,
I can take her out in style.
Howd I look with a dame wearing
cotton stockings and a crummy hat?
Anyway, I won 37 francs.
If you dont mind, well add that
to what I owe you.
Be a pal and pay the check too.
What a wonderful evening.
Youre too good to me.
Are you happy?
Oh, yes.  But you spend
too much money on me.
Ive got 8 francs left
enough for the Metro.
12:30
I told Adele Id be home by midnight.
How time flies
and we havent even done
anything yet, my love.
To think weve never spent
the night together.
I want to spend a
whole night with you
to feel your soft warm body
close to mine all night.
Im coming up with you.
I dont want you to get
in trouble over me.
Ill make up something.
Let me come up.
Be reasonable.  I want to
as much as you do
but youve got to go home.
Your lights are on!
I I forgot to turn them out.
Id better go up with you.
You never know.
Nonsense.  Burglars wouldnt
turn on the lights
and I wouldnt let you climb all those stairs.
Youre just an overgrown kid.
Give me a kiss.
No, better than that.
But, oh, Dédé baby.
Its about time.  I was gonna blow.
Darling, Maurice almost came up
when he saw the light.
So what?  You could pass me off
as your brother.
Listen
I need some dough, baby.
I don't have any.
He only had 8 francs left.
What about these flowers?
And whats this?
Candy
Okay, Ive had it.  Im cutting out.
What are you gonna do with those?
If anybody asks,
you dont know nothing.
Stay awhile.
Sure, stay and chat with Madame.
What do you take me for?
I want to talk to you about
something 100% legit.
You dont think Id get
mixed up in anything shady?
Im selling paintings.
What are you laughing about?
Theres money in art like
in anything else.
Theyre pictures Legrand
gave Lulu.
The signatures will give you away.
They aint signed and I wont
say theyre by Legrand.
Lagrand gave them to Lulu,
so theyre mine.
People say theyre good, so they
must be worth something.
The only thing that counts in art
is the signatures.
And since you cant use
a famous signature
youll only get chicken feed.
Fill em up again.
On my tab, Amedee.
Ill say I painted them.
You dont look much like a painter.
Lulu thats no name.
Whats her full name?
Lucien Pelletier.
Its corny.
Why dont you say
Lulu painted them
but say her name is Clara Wood.
Who is Clara Wood?
A filly that won in the fifth today.
Cost me a bundle, too.
This thing interests me.
Im taking you to see a dealer.
I was supposed to see the old lady,
but the hell with it.
Lets take a taxi and Ill
look at the paintings.
Im getting tired of all this art dealing.
If this one fails, then Im quitting.
Now, dont get discouraged.
Mr. Wallstein?
What do you want?
I brought you two paintings.
Ill be with you in a minute.
Im busy.
Theres no signatures.
Whos it by?
Whos that?
An American artist.
And theyre yours?
Not exactly.  But I handle
all of Mrs. Woods business.
I see.
Im Langelar, the art critic.
We can make painters, you know.
Maybe I could help this
Clara Wood of yours.
Shes young?... she paints a lot?
I would say so.  Shes a fine artist.
Well have to look into this.
Well then, lets talk.
I can see well get along.
Sure.  Everythings on the level.
Wallstein, come on over.
Look at this.
Several weeks go by
Excuse me, Miss.  My employer
asked me to price that painting.
25,000 francs.
But its not a well-known
signature
Not to you, but Mrs. Wood is
becoming very famous abroad.
Can you give me her address?
My boss could deal with
her directly.
Im sorry but Mrs. Wood
has signed
an exclusive 10 year
contract with Mr. Wallstein.
It was my idea
and my brother Fernand
took them to the dealer.
Your brother Fernand?
I told you about him.
Hes in business.
And the dealer said
they were terrific
and he asked for the
artist to sign them all.
And since you did give them
to me, dear
Dont you think its swell,
selling them all like that?
Of course.  Its wonderful.
Im so happy to be stepping
out with you, Dédé.
Well, so am I, baby.  So am I.
Only tonight aint gonna
be much fun.
I know Langelars friends
Theyre all artists.  They dont even
know how to dress.  Youll see.
You sure look snappy, Dédé.
Id like to go someplace
smart with you, like the opera.
The operas old hat, baby.
But if you really want to,
well go one of these days
cause now youre really somebody.
Im somebody now?
Sure, youre a celebrity and
you owe it all to me.
So, youve got to
be seen around town.
And tonight well just have to
put up with those creeps.
Now that Im somebody,
Id much rather be nobody
and just be alone with you
all the time in a little house.
Sure, but tonight I gotta
see Wallstein.
Isnt Clara here?
She must be with Langelar.
Mr. Wallstein, how about
a little advance?
Youre getting a little
greedy, dont you think?
Langelar wants Clara
to meet a client
so just wait a bit.
Whos he?
Some guy who wants
his portrait done.
Clara doesnt do portraits.
I know, but thats her mistake.
Clara, weve got to have
a serious talk.
Youre pleased with me, I hope?
Youre meeting high society
and weve reached a good many
collectors
so believe me, its high time
you did some portraits.
But I dont want to.
Why?  We know whats best
for our painters.
And this is a golden opportunity.
Ill introduce you.  Hes loaded
and if you muff this chance,
its too bad for you.
I dont want to do portraits.
Men are such bores
always after the same thing.
Play us something nice.
How about a waltz?
Ill have a talk with her.
Youre a nut!  Turning down that deal.
Youd like me to do it, darling?
Ill give his snapshot to Maurice
and he can do the portrait.
No snapshots.  Someone
might get suspicious.
Just ask him for 5,000 francs
in advance
and let him make out
with you a bit.
Oh, what a bore!
Whats the difference,
just this once?
Mr. Dugodet, Id like you
to meet Mr. Wallstein.
And where is this famous Clara?
Clara, my dear, this is Mr. Dugodet.
What an amusing party!
But then, you know what they
say about artists.
Its quieter over here.
Lets pull out, pal.
Isnt she something?
Well, she may as well
do it that way.
Pay to the order of
now my name
now yours
the date
How clumsy you can be, my little doll.
Money sure smells sweet.
You say your sugar daddy
handed it over without a beef?
Well, baby, youre not very smart.
You should have asked for more.
Could you give me 300 francs?
I need to have a dress made.
Youre the one who wants
me to go out.
A girl in your position
always makes out.
I dont owe you nothing.
Didnt I put you where you are?
What about the rent?
Just tell the old guy
to get a move on.
He paints at a snails pace,
for Petes sake.
Leaving already, Dédé darling?
Youre mean.  Youre going
back to the café
and youre gonna start drinking
with your pals again?
And theyll will all
your money at cards.
Well, goodbye, darling.
Kiss me better than that.
Dont drink too much,
and dont get a chill.
Why so sad?
Whats the matter?
Troubles?
I thought that Wallstein
Oh, you know those art dealers,
they promise a lot, but
Anyhow, right now Im broke.
Alright Ill see what I can do.
Dont you recognize me?
You must have seen me someplace.
Im sure shes got a picture
of me on the wall
if I know her
just to get your goat.
Its the moustache that throws you off.
Sergeant Alexis Godard
your wifes dead husband.
Alexis Godard!
Youre not dead!
Of course I am.  Thats
why I want to talk to you.
But not here.  Lets go to
a café and Ill explain.
In September of 1914 I was listed
among the dead.
Actually I was a PW in Germany
under the name of a dead pal.
I switched our papers
to get away from my wife,
not the army.
And then
Ive knocked around a lot.
Ive even been in jail.
Ive got an offer for you.
Suppose I came and said,
This womans mine
Youre not married.  Im taking her back.
And me, a heroic soldier
And what were you doing,
while I was getting killed?
You were stealing my wife!
What would you have to say to that?
I wouldnt have a thing to say.
Id just have to step aside.
Got a cigarette?
A light?
I figured youd help me
make the sacrifice.
I deserve a little compensation
for my sacrifice, dont I?
Whats 10,000 francs to you?
Oh, not all at once.
Give me 5,000 now
and the rest in a month or so.
No, no.  Im the one who must leave.
Im the one who
must make the sacrifice.
Youre Adeles lawful husband.
You have first call.
Im the wife stealer.
So long as I didnt know,
I was excusable.
But now I just cant go on.
What a mess!
You see, I let them think I was dead.
I took a phony name.
I even pulled some capers
in a dead mans name.
If I go back to my wife now,
Ill have to answer to the authorities.
better to just go away.
Give me a thousand francs
and youll never see me again.
You must have some
savings put away
Yes, Adele keeps some savings
in the cupboard.
Im not allowed near them.
But come to think of it,
youre the rightful husband.
Why dont you get the
money yourself?
You know where the cupboard is.
No dice.  If you want to give me
some money, take it yourself.
If I take Madame Godards money
from Madame Godards flat,
Id be stealing.
What if Adele catches me
and calls the police?
Dont worry. We go to the
theater tomorrow evening.
Well be out till midnight.
You can come around eleven.
Heres the key.
When you pass the concierge,
just say Legrand.
And when youve got what
you want, leave quietly.
So its all set.
11 p.m. tomorrow?
Legrand
Youve been drinking again?
Now dont worry about a thing.
Just look at the state youre in.
What if he came back, Adele?
Id love to see your face
if he came back.
Youre disgusting.
Go to bed.
Well have it out tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be a great day, Adele.
Do forgive me Madame,
if I call you Adele.
Tis habit born of a
long misunderstanding
which brought us together in
the same bed for several years.
Tomorrow
Arent you done reading yet?
50 more pages.
Im thirsty.
Teach you to go out drinking.
Thats better.
Oh no!  A short circuit!
Bastard!
You said you were going
to the theater.
Help! Murder!
Well fix things tomorrow.
Dont squeeze too hard.
Lets get a light
from the kitchen.
The neighbors might lynch you.
What about the dough
you promised me?
There was a short circuit.
He went into the kitchen
for a glass of water
the lights went out and
my husband vanished.
Madame, I could understand
your inventing this story
of thieves in the night.
But the minions of the law
have a right to the truth.
Im sure theyre discreet.
Gentlemen, this is a matter
of some delicacy.
I was in bed with the lady
when her husband caught us.
Fearing a violent scene,
the lady called for help.
Fortunately, both her husband and I
are peaceful men.
But, what happened to the husband?
Was he the one that ran away?
Im done for.
Youre not dead!
Why wont you let me drop him, Dédé?
We need him.
But Dédé, Ive been doing
some figuring.
No, dont get up yet.
Stay until half past, please.
Oh, dont make faces.
Youll be with your pals
in 40 minutes
Am I such bad company
as all that?
Listen, we must have put
some money aside
from the paintings
you sold Wallstein.
Since when am I supposed to answer
to you for the dough?
Youre so mean.  I just meant
that youre the one
whos been putting it aside.
And you did right.
cause I might have spent it all.
So now maybe we have enough
to live on for a few months
if we went away.
Ah, freedom.  Lulu
life is wonderful.
You could paint pictures yourself
Youre just as smart as Legrand.
Smarter even.
Id buy your paints
clean your brushes.
Shut up.  What a pill!
Alright, dear.  We wont
talk about it no more.
Kiss me.
I dont think Mlle. Pelletier is home.
Thats alright.  Ive got a key.
But Im sure shes out.
Ill wait for her upstairs.
Oh, well.  Let them stew
in their own juice.
Youre my brother Im sick
you came to visit
hurry up and dress.
Sure.  Hes my boyfriend.
What about it?
You had to pester me into
going to bed, huh?
You think it gives me a thrill?
And you had to give the
old fogey a key?
Dont get mad he
did say nothing.
No but I got an idea he was
laughing at us all the time.
I should have busted
his head with this chair.
What are you crying for?
Heres something to cry about.
Now whos gonna
give us pictures, huh?
And my car aint even paid up.
Im fed up.  Im gettin outta here.
Dédé! When will I see you?
Im gonna be busy this week
and next.
Then youll write me?
Thats right Ill write you.
The next morning
I didnt expect you back.
Darling, Im sorry not to
have guessed the truth.
Ive lived a life apart.
I know nothing of this world
I dont know women
were such poor wretches
that theres always some man
around to profit by their mistakes.
But now I understand.  Im free now.
Youve nothing to fear.
I feel strong enough
to shield you from anyone.
Why dont you trust me
confide in me?
Id have torn you
from the clutches of that man.
Wont you finish your painting?
I need it.
Suppose I dont finish it?
Youve got to.
So thats it.
It was all for my paintings
thats all you saw in me.
Whatd you expect?  Take a look
in the mirror.
What a fool I was.
You make me sick.
You think it didnt make me sick?
If it wasnt for your money,
Id have dropped you like a hot potato.
You wanted to be loved for your own
sweet self.  What a laugh!
Youre no woman.  Youre a bitch.
You lick the hand that feeds you
the hand that beats you too.
Youre wasting your breath
That pimp of yours beats you
and he knew what he was doing.
Maybe he did beat me
but I loved him.
You love him, huh?
Come on.  Get dressed.
Were leaving tonight.
Well go far away from here hurry.
You want to stay with him?
You cant do that to me.
Ive given up everything
for you, Lucienne.
If only you knew
You cant be in love with that guy.
He has no heart no upbringing.
Lucienne you dont love
me anymore?
Dont laugh, Lucienne.
Dont laugh like that, Lucienne.
Out of my way, kids.
Didnt even say hello and me with
mail for Madame Pelletier.
Queer people!
Ill just take the mail up.
Anatole, something bad!
Hows Lulu?
Shut up about Lulu, you hear?
Dont get mad.
Im not mad.  Im not mad.
Yes, you are pal.
I tell you Im not.
Just let me alone
Two guys asking for me
Are you Andre Joquin?
Come along.
But I dont know you.
Okay, okay.  Whats the
world coming to?
Hey, how long is this nonsense gonna last?
Ive got things to do.
Im wasting time.
Now, now just be patient.
Thats easy for you to say.
Look at that dumb face.
Hello, Mr. Legrand.
Dont worry, pal
itll be alright.
Youre Madame Pelletier
the mother of ? 
No sir.  As I said before
I was cashier in a wholesale house.
With my salary, how could
I have kept a mistress?
Do you know Andre Joquin?
I saw him once the day
I met Lucienne Pelletier.
Later, I learned she was
still going with him
I resolved to break with her
But I was very attached to her
Im a weak man I couldnt
bring myself to do it.
Did she leave any paintings with you?
Any sketches or drawings?
Id be interested in buying them.
Its a dangerous thing to
have affairs at our age.
They usually mean trouble
better stick to a quiet life at home.
Your testimony sheds no new light
on the case.
Anyway, youre not the sort
thats usually involved
in crimes like this.
Im sorry to have bothered you.
Now dont get panicky.
Were going in to see the magistrate.
Just let me do the talking.
Okay, youre a lawyer.. so
please make em understand.
I didnt know she was a painter.
Shut up.  Dont be a fool.
The magistrates a man
you can talk to.
Well, have you thought it over?
Are you going to confess
you killed Lucienne Pelletier?
You dont want me to confess just
to make you happy, do you sir?
Why would I kill her?
I had everything to lose.
Youve confessed that Lulu asked
you about money that evening
and I am informed that
you quarreled violently.
She even told you she was
leaving you for a cashier
with whom she was
having an affair.
What about a cashier?
Lulu never said a word about that.
Shed have told me
and Id have told her to drop him.
She could do better n that.
Lulu was a beautiful girl.
Whats the name of this cashier?
Thats wrong, sir.
Mr. Legrands a painter.
And Im in a position to know,
sir believe me.
Oh, shut up.  You werent
there, were you?
Now if you really insist
I murdered Lulu
I dont want to contradict you.
So you confess!
Of course not.  Im just kidding.
Alright.  Now lets
look at your record
I cant say its exactly in your favor.
Oh, I pulled a few fast ones
like most kids
even the best kids.
Sure I got money from women
but they were glad to give it to me.
What about this white slavery
business?
Oh, not white slavery!
I just gave advice to some
girls who wanted to travel
get an education
And it was better than scrubbing
floors or working in a factory.
Yes, you begin with
a few fast ones
and you end up
murdering someone.
Meaning Lulu?
Well, the concierge said
Oh, that concierge has
it in for me
Im the only real fall guy
in this business.
Why, if Id never been in jail
Id have no job contacts.
Youre a cynic.
A cynic?  Why a cynic?
Youve been with us a long time
and weve been highly satisfied with you.
Your regrettable affair
with a notorious young lady
who just met with
an untimely end
would be quite inexplicable
had you not incurred,
on behalf of that young lady
expenses out of all proportion
to your avowed income.
We do not believe in prying into
our employees private lives
provided, of course, they
behave properly in their functions.
However, these expenses of yours
did concern us
in so far as the money might
have come out of our till.
We had the books checked last
night after closing time
2,500 francs are missing
Henriot and Companys cashiers
must be above suspicion
You will have to leave, Mr. Legrand.
Find yourself a job where you will
not be placed in temptations way.
Very well, sir.  Ill go
But Ill pay you back, just
to show you that
No, forget about it
Youre leaving for reasons of health
No one here will know a thing.
Defendant, you are about to hear
the evidence against you.
First witness.
My husband and I were listening
to the street singers
when I saw him go up
to Madame Pelletiers flat.
A few minutes later I went up
and found the body.
I remember wondering why
he didnt say hello
because if he had, I would
have given him the mail.
My husband and I said,
What queer people.
And you didnt see anyone else go up?
No one.
Gentleman, Im afraid Andre Joquins
military record is rather bad
He was constantly going AWOL
and even managed to become the
protector of a local prostitute.
Please face the jury, Colonel
He finished his service in Africa
and his superiors had not been
lenient at the time of his discharge
hed still be serving time
in a penal battalion
and would not be here today.
Gentleman of the jury,
I cannot believe
that a doubt has not entered
your minds by now
and if this is not strong
enough for an acquittal
think of the defendants ill-starred
redity and lamentable childhood.
Let me talk.  I want to talk.
Where did you get all that crap?
Do you know my family?  Were you
with my girl when she got killed?
So cut the fancy talk.
The only thing that matters here is the
defendant. And thats me.
Look.  I wanna be polite.
I dont wanna shout
But I swear Im not guilty
I swear I didnt kill Lulu.
It wasnt me.
Suicide.
Foreman, will you please
read the verdict?
On my honor and conscience,
before God and men
the jury answers yes
to all questions.
in application of the
aforesaid articles
Andre Joquin is
sentenced to die
in a public place
Hey, what do you think
you are doing?
Sergeant!
What do you know!
Nice to see you again.
What you up to these days?
Not much.  And you?
See for yourself.
Just like me, then.
What about Adele?
She kicked the bucket years ago.
Well, maybe shes better off.
I wouldnt mind being dead myself.
What kind of talk is that?
Got any tobacco?
A lots happened since
I last saw you
Ive been a junk man, hobo,
drunkard, thief
and to begin with, a murderer.
Well, it takes all kinds.
20 francs.
Boy, are we gonna have a feast!
Life is beautiful.  Come on.
