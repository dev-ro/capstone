      THE ONE THING IN THE WORLD
     THAT REALLY CHILLS MY BONES
                TO THE MARROW
           IS WHEN A PRETTY GIRL
              IN A WEDDING DRESS
                 LOOKS AT ME
         AND FINDS ME REPULSIVE.
 OH, DON'T BE SILLY,
       DOCTOR.
          OH, I'M OFTEN SILLY --
          ONE OF MY MAJOR VICES.
      ANOTHER ONE IS THE DESIRE
      ON MY PART TO HELP OTHERS,
                HOWEVER RANCID
               THAT MAY SOUND.
THEN YOU CAN HELP ME BY
TELLING ME WHERE RICHARD IS.
           I'M NOT SURE
        WHERE RICHARD IS,
     OR, INDEED,
   UH, WHAT HE IS.
              OH, AND YOU WONDER
               WHY YOUNG GIRLS
              IN WEDDING DRESSES
           GIVE YOU DIRTY LOOKS.
     NO, NO, NO.
  I'M QUITE SERIOUS.
I'VE KNOWN THIS FAMILY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
I'VE BEEN AWARE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE OF DEPRESSION
AND THE SLIGHTLY DEMENTED
QUALITY THAT HANGS OVER IT.
BUT THESE ARE SUBTLE MATTERS,
  SO I NEVER SPOKE.
   I WILL TELL YOU,
     YOUNG LADY,
THAT I KNOW THAT LOUISE
    DID NOT LEAVE,
  BUT WAS TAKEN AWAY
 FROM CASTLE HALORAN.
     PERHAPS EVEN
  HER HUSBAND, JOHN,
  DIDN'T ACTUALLY GO
ON THAT BUSINESS TRIP.
              I DON'T KNOW WHAT
           YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
YOU THINK I'M SOME KIND
     OF VILLAIN.
   CAN YOU IMAGINE
    WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO TRY TO HELP OTHERS AND TO BE
MISTRUSTED EVERY TIME?
    MY LIP TWISTS.
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT
EVERY WORD I SAY IS SINISTER.
              I DON'T KNOW WHAT
          YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
      TO YOU --
 THAT I'VE DISCOVERED
 THINGS IN THIS HOUSE
 THAT MAKE ME UNEASY,
AND THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY
IN A POSITION OF SOME DANGER.
                FROM RICHARD?
PRIMARILY FROM RICHARD,
  BUT I'M NOT SURE.
 IT COULD BE ANYONE.
               WELL, MAYBE YOU
               HAVE FORGOTTEN,
               BUT I CERTAINLY
                   HAVEN'T.
              I'M HIS WIFE NOW.

AND A SISTER-IN-LAW
  AND HIS MOTHER...

        YOU ARE A VERY SICK MAN.
