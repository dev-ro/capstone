We changed the wings left and right
the radiator support,
radiator, headlight left, right...
hood, windshield...
the front bumper and
grille strengthening...
We repaired the frame,
based on shock absorbers.
We changed the water pump,
power steering pump,
battery and, of course, the paint has
been redone on the damaged parts,
what we changed:
Hood, front fenders,
bumpers, grille, doors...
And finally...
a general polishing.
We sent the seat covers for cleaning.
- It's spotless.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
- For insurance
you need to sign...
- Yes, of course.
- Sign the receipt.
- That's it.
- Lend me your pen.
- Here is your key.
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir, goodbye.
- Thank you.
Despues de LUCIA
What happened to the car?
I sold it.
Here are your pajamas and your toothbrush.
Thank you.
You want some?
No thank you.
You sure? It's almond.
It's very pretty.
Does the job.
Shall we?
Hmmmm.
I have time for a bath?
Yes.
Hi! Sorry but this is my seat.
- Pardon.
- No, do not worry.
You traveled by car or plane?
By car.
In how many hours?
Plus or minus 10 hours.
You're not tired?
A little, but I'll be fine.
Your father seems to be a good person.
We get along very well.
What subjects did you have today?
History, English and biology.
What did you think?
Well, it's pretty similar to what I've done before.
Well, if you need anything,
just let me know.
Thank you.
Ready?
No, I'm trying.
So...
How awful this drug
testing of students.
These are the rules of the school.
It is the same for all students.
My name is Jose.
You take advantage?
This is great!
You just arrived in Puerto Vallarta? How is it?
- Yes.
- Totally different...
We go to "La Contessa"?
- No luck.
- No, you feel like it.
I'll be the one or the other.
I think you know Camila.
- Hi. -How are you?
- Irene.
- The "big" and Manuel. -Hi.
- Javier...
Hi, Javier.
She has already given me one.
Take another one.
Who's gonna eat all that?
You ate on the way to Jose's house.
- And then, anyway...
- Where are you from?
I come from Puerto Vallarta.
- Wow, that must be nice there!
- Yes.
What were you doing there?
Well, you know... surfing...
- Going to school, hanging out with friends.
- From surfing...
What?
- Of course, silly.
- Surfer...
Up on the board...
Catch the wave...
- He rises and falls...
- Yes.
And why you came to the capital?
À because of my father's work.
- What is he doing?
- He is a chef.
Great, hey Big?!
He came to open a restaurant?
Yes.
Where?
I haven't been yet, but I think it is...
- ... La Contessa.
- Yes... I see...
What kind of food?
All but crustaceans and fish, especially.
- A real treat.
- It's the same.
- We will see you there?
- Hmm.
And you live where?
Anzures, Polanco.
- I live near there. Really?
- That's true.
- Great.
- What's the joke?
He does not know where it is and
he says he lives in Polanco!
It's disgusting... disgusting...
It makes me want to
vomit when he does that.
I had a beach restaurant
and the fish came from Canada or Asia.
Because domestic products
are too expensive.
Okay, we'll stop with them.
I wanted to show you this.
That's fine, but I lean
towards the second faded.
So you prefer something lighter...
A gray, for example?
Yes, let's see...
Something more informal.
- Very well.
- Sorry... Excuse me.
Hello, my love. How are you?
Yes, I am trying to work a bit.
As you wish.
Come on, rock band.
I'm on this side, near the window.
I'll call you when it arrives.
Or I send an SMS.
Ok.
Ok Thank you.
I love you.
This is good.
It is sweet, big.
- Sweet.
- I do not want it, asshole.
And how is the school for you?
Well, I think it's good.
José told me that you had
been called to the drug test.
- Yes.
- Are you worried?
I am.
We could tell you how to change the cup.
This is true.
I'm screwed.
for what?...
what do you take?
I smoked marijuana there for a week.
Do not worry. They will
not tell your parents.
They only offer a rehabilitation program.
But your father is very "concerned"?
No. My father is very quiet.
And your mother?
My mother is in Puerto Vallarta.
But your father tell will tell her?
I do not think so.
But if he finds out, will it be a mess?
probably not.
So it's ok. In fact.
I was trying to find a pool.
I think I found one in the south.
I don't know the address. As
soon as I have it, let's go.
Of course.
We need to buy things at the supermarket.
Tomorrow and for the rest of the week.
Yes.
We never had neighbors like home...
Puerto.
Or better yet, maybe they buy here?
What is it?
I do not know.
Try again.
What is it?
I can not tell.
If you do not know what it
is, how will you prepare?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.
- No problem.
I'll be direct.
The school implements periodic
drug testing for students.
We tested Alejandra and
she showed positive for marijuana.
I don't understand what the
school has to do with it?
- Did you know she's using marijuana?
- No.
The school recommends a
rehabilitation program.
Obviously, we can not force it.
If it is positive again, we must expel.
How long do you smoke?
I tried for about three months.
With who?
With friends in Puerto.
Who?
Manolo and Julia.
And you often smoked?
Not just a few times.
- Really?
- Yes.
I promise I'll quit.
Really, I'm fine.
Yes...
Yes, the hospital, I guess.
No, the funeral will not be covered.
I think it will not be reimbursed.
Leticia is one thing.
Ok, I see.
listening...
In the evening?
Alejandra is very happy.
Sorry Leticia. I have to get back to the kitchen.
So I'll call you.
Bye.
A... Two...
Three...!
You do not want!
Let instead...
Go.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
More sparkling.
À what time will you arrive?
It depends.
on who will look after my kids?
If my mother stayed with them...
We're going early. You can
come with us in the car.
She took my head.
Careful, it's hot!
Also, what about going to
marry outside of the capital.
It is Cuernavaca.
So I will not have any excuses.
Neither of us.
I have no solution.
I'll have to stay until the
end of the ceremony, imagine.
This is what happens,
weddings are all alike.
No guest wants to go, and
soon even more are engaged!
This is not true!
It will be the same for my wedding?
Pay attention to the food.
Of course not.
Marina has no desire?
No really.
She loves marriage.
All...
What?
All women love marriage.
Joaquin, not me.
- What is it?
- Excuse me.
Seriously?
I have no patience.
Tell me what you need me to help you.
Sorry, I said no from the beginning.
Sorry.
Roberto?
I returned earlier.
Everything okay?
I was invited to Valle
de Bravo, this weekend.
That is good.
What has happened?
I quit.
Why?
There's Joaquín.
What did he say?
He's nervous.
You do not want to go back?
You must convince him.
Hello!
Hello!
This is very good.
And cooked through.
Look...
You see the consistency of this?
Compared to that?
Delicious.
So we should put more milk?
Much more milk before adding the cheese.
- You like?
- Yes.
It looks a bit funny here.
I think it suits you.
I went to the restaurant. I
met Mauricio and Jimena.
Are you gonna take?
So we go?
You have taught your daughter to drive
and once on the highway
she hit a trailer.
I was not trying to teach her to drive.
This is the testimony of your daughter.
I talked about how to drive. But
I was not trying to teach her.
It makes no difference in the procedure.
This is just to close the case.
Sorry, but this is important. I was
not trying to teach him to drive.
If you want, I can review the
documents with my supervisor.
You have presented no no funeral expenses?
No.
I need a more detailed description
what happened to the body of your
wife after being declared dead.
We took care of her.
The insurance covers
but we need to know what happened
to the body after the accident.
Your daughter she receives
psychological support?
She went once, but not anymore.
Insurance can pay up to a
year for its consultations.
Thank you, but we do not need.
Careful, asshole!
- What do you want, asshole?
- Asshole!
Fuck you!
What is your problem?
What is it?
I'll fuck you up!
Dad?
It was early, right? -Yes.
Why?
they made me want to leave.
I was looking for you.
Yes, I know.
I left early.
Hey...
Manuel and Irene are together?
No, not really.
But she loves him.
It does not show up when he is not drunk.
He loves a bit.
They used to stay here in the evenings.
But the last time Manuel was
with another girl by accident.
Why do you ask?
You like Manuel?
I'd become a nun!
No, no, no.
This is how...
It is very beautiful here!
- Yes.
- It is a beautiful place.
Indeed.
- Now you will drink!
- No.
- No, wait!
- Ale! Ale! Take a dose.
- No, no, no.
- Ale!
Come on, girl!
The horror! No!
Go! Go!
- Go!
- No luck!
- Definitely not, José!
- Come on.
Not in the eyes, no!
- In the eyes, no!
- Then you open your mouth!
So, give me the bottle.
I swear...
- Give the bottle!
- I swear on the head of my cousin Antonio.
- Go!
- Give the bottle, asshole.
Hey Manuel...
- "On the head of my cousin Antonio"...
- Joints...
- Go ahead, Manue...
- Do not spill anything.
A joint...
He has a cousin named Antonio.
What?
José has a cousin named Antonio?
Look at the crap he tells you.
Don't get it wet, hey?
- Already-soaked!
- I dried my hands.
- Okay.
- We don't want it wet.
- Wait a minute.
- You first.
Never! Me!
Well, you start.
Shit!
Damn, man! You should have a dry towel.
Fuck...
- Let me see.
- Fucking lighter!
Damn, it's cold!
- Ok, no...
- It does not matter...
But it is not lit!
This is good.
- Eat it.
- What crap, pure paper!
- Give me some!
- It is bound! You're great!
Shit!
- Where did you get it?
- I bought it near the school.
Plush?
Plush is crazy!
Spread...
You dropped the ashes into the water!
it smells good.
It's cold in here!
It's cold.
Yes, it is very cold.
- Pass!
- It was a bitch this morning.
The drug test was positive.
So what? Who cares!
- Yes, it did!
- Only a breath!
Come on, it's a joke.
- No, I do not like.
- Shit.
It's great.
This is great.
Give a little.
Fuck!
His eyes are all red!
No, I've stopped.
His hand is soaked!
Come on...
You're all wet!
It is a delight with this freshness.
Wait, you're...
Watch the ashes.
Nearly gone, put the ashes...
Do not laugh.
- What did you do?
- Jette, don't ash in the water!
- My parents are going to be furious.
- Come on, smoke.
Hurry!
Ale, smokes a little!
With manual?
Really?
When I left...
- You were in front?
- Yes, exactly...
- How could you?
- It was an accident!
What a story! And what was that?
I do not know.
- I do not even know.
- Jose, I need the toilet.
It happens. Wait a little.
Seriously, it was crazy...
And the night is over?
Hi!
What happened?
I broke in the oven.
How was it?
What did you do?
It was good.
But what happened?
I broke the oven, my daughter.
Hello.
Hello, tata.
No, it's not there.
Hey Jose.
Yes, roughly...
An hour or two is good.
Yeah, okay.
In fact, I think it's better.
I'm working on it now.
Right.
Tata, I gotta go. I call
you tomorrow, okay?
Between!
What is it? There is no class?
There was no teacher.
You want a coffee?
Ok.
You going today?
Yes, soon.
"Hello bitch!"
Black coffee?
I think I'm lactose intolerant.
Since when?
This is done for me.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Jose.
What do you want?
I want to talk to you.
For what?
I know how it looks.
Jerk! What do you want?
Open. I just want to talk.
I did not send the video.
The video was on your mobile phone.
Yes, but I forgot the
phone in the bathroom.
Anyone could have picked it up.
And who could have sent the video?
I don't know.
Because the whole school has seen.
Yes... But I'm there too. I am in the video.
- And what did you say?
- This is absurd.
You're not going to stop
going to school for it.
Half of the Earth has seen the video.
I know.
Why have sex right there?
I smoked.
That's not an excuse.
You knew he was recording.
I didn't think he'd put the
video on the Internet.
And what will you do now?
I don't know.
How long's it take to arrive?
Nothing, just for practice.
it smells good!
I found...
A wonderful head.
Who?
Just arrived in the United
States but Mexican.
Beautiful appearance, knows enough wine...
This is good!
- How old was she?
- 40.
- What's her name?
- Marta.
Apparently, you have loved Martha.
No, nothing doing.
Okay...
It's good that you like her.
No, I just said she had a beautiful look.
Is that your Mothers?
Yes.
Should I change?
No, that's fine.
Thank you.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
You let him do in the video.
- Where are you going?
- Fool!
Good, very good...
Go.
Will not give a damn!
Shit!
What a bitch, man!
What a mess!
Whore.
She broke my phone. Let me see.
You're stupid.
The case is ruined.
Take the battery.
What happened, Manuel.
We discussed a group work
and Alejandra went crazy.
Can you explain what happened, Alejandra?
That's it.
It was really a project?
Yes.
You don't tell us what actually happened.
This is what really happened.
Go in the other room.
- And my phone?
- I'll pay.
Why fight?
I told you.
Why are you so aggressive?
I don't want to talk.
You seem focussed on helping
me with the restaurant
or you're worried about
the house or the car.
I'm just wondering if it's
going well at school.
Super.
I do not want you to be expelled.
Alejandra...
Javier...
We go to your cousin's wedding on Saturday?
I go alone.
- Who's coming with you?
- No-one. I'm alone.
You already know what you are
going to wear on Friday?
No, I'm going to buy something today.
- I have nothing.
- Okay.
If you want to go. I'll buy
a pair of pants or a skirt.
And see you another day
to dress like this...
- Or even go together.
- Home?
- Can we?
- Yes, of course.
We get together and...
- Put on make-up and...
- I will lend you what you don't have.
Cam, what's the lining?
In Mariana.
it's going to be very transparent.
Really? Come, let me see.
This is very transparent.
Watch.
I like. You have a beautiful body.
I do not know. I do not like long sleeves.
But if you carry them well, you look well.
- Take.
- Thank you.
They are beautiful.
I love them. I bought them recently.
They are really beautiful.
Let's see...
What are you doing?
She's beautiful this bitch.
- José will be hypnotized.
- Irene, no photos...
Are you embarrassed?
- Where do you think go, idiot?
- I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
Home. Where else could I go?
Why are you with Jose every day?
I'm not with Jose..
We are only in the same neighborhood.
Do not lie to me.
You're still sucking him, right?
I never sucked!
- Manuel said.
- And why you're together all day?
I am with you every day!
You spend all day with Jose.
Don't lie to me!
Do not look at me with that face!
Leave me alone! No!
Go do it!
So it seems I haven't seen you since last night
and I'm not so late.
Vegetables, how?
Yet it is quiet...
but we expect a large group.
I hope you do not go too late.
And how's school?
Ah, well.
Yes...
If I arrive earlier, we will
prepare something good, right?
It is at the table... 17.
Yes, Dad...
As you wish.
Joaquín too?
My phone.
My phone!
My phone.
Take it, bitch.
Take.
Then.
Is it good?
Hello, tata.
Good.
No, I was sleeping.
You're okay.
With the keys?
Where?
He told me he had sold it.
I do not understand how...
You cut your hair?
Yesterday.
Why? everything okay?
Because I wanted to.
What have you done to Mom's car?
Why?
Leticia told me that it was
found with the keys in it.
Pretty strange, right?
We drank something blue.
- No grass?
- We took the vodka, tequila...
I told you to wait for me and we left.
- We?
- It was quiet...
- Really...
- Following the path it was short?
We were more or less 40 minutes.
Dude, we messed up.
because of alcohol?
No, because I asked for the most expensive.
It was great.
What was that? A blue something.
Ale...
Ale...
It's cool, man!
Brand new.
We have now completed the course,
I give you permission
to travel to Veracruz.
Travel is required, but
your parents must sign their consent.

You know what I remember?
Everyone was standing.
And what did you do then?
Nothing, I don't know.
Take your business. Your bed is one.
Do not enter. I'll use the bathroom.

- Roberto Rojas?
- Yes.
Officer Sergio Martín, pleased to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine.
- I take the case from now on.
That's good, because I do not like
the way things are going.
Martina, lend me a pen.
We have some questions. Okay?
Thank you.
is going to be quick...
Do you know the name of your daughter's
friends who were at the beach?
- one is called José.
- Jose...
- Another manual.
- You do not know the name?
I do not know.
- No?
- She is still new to the school.
There is a girl who's called ... Carla...
Do not worry.
We'll check.
Children...
What kind of drugs your daughter use?
None.
They did a test and it was positive.
The school told us.
What does this have to do with it?
A lot.
They were on the beach, swimming...
Maybe drugged, drunk...
- Here is the problem.
- She did not do drugs.
No drugs. That night, right?
No drugs.
Ok.
What is your relationship with
your daughter? How's it going?
Well, well.
I do not know the name of...
Well...
Why not ask those who were
with her on the beach?
I can't, Mr. Rojas.
They are minors.
So you can't do anything?
Yes.
You have experience in these cases?
No, of course...
Well, young...
Of the school.
I'm already gone in my case.
Yes...
I have the address.
Ok, I'll see you there.
Thank you.
Leticia?
You shot the video?
But I did not put on the Internet.
Then who?
I don't know, it was the
weekend we were in Valle.
Who sent it?
I don't know.
Why did you keep it?
She knew it was recorded.
It was our idea, both of us.
You knew they were assaulting?
I do not want you to know.
Who?
You.
Ale told us that the sea was rough.
When we were at the beach, she was thrown into the water.
- And we were behind it.
- She did not want to leave.
- Shut up.
- Shut up!
You can stop for a moment, if you please?
Since you sent the video, you mock it.
- I did not send!
- Not sent, yes, hypocritical.
- It was you!
- Javier...
What did you do?
Nothing.
The lawyer said to do
nothing until they call me.
