Hey! Get off me!
Hey! Get outta here. Go on!
Shoo!
Ooh, you sure picked the wrong guy
to get hot dogs from, kid.
- Get away from me!
- Whoa! Chill out, man.
I don't eat cats.
It's too much fur.
I've been watching you,
and I think you're in serious need
of some professional guidance.
Now what do ya say we team up
and change old Louie's mind...
about sharing those hot dogs?
I'm not goin'
back there again.
Hey. It'd be a snap, kid.
I'm an expert at these things.
All you gotta do
is learn some moves.
- Moves?
- You know. Tempo.
Ooo-cha-ba. A rhythm. This city's
got a beat. You gotta hook into it.
And once you got the beat,
you can do anything.
- I can?
- "Absitively posolutely."
The man you see before you
is affectionately known as "Old Louie."
A well-known enemy
of the four-legged world.
Our mission, cat, is to liberate
those all-beef kosher franks,
and hightail it
outta here.
- Startin' to feel that rhythm?
- Well, uh...
Yeah! Yeah!
I do feel it!
When are we gonna get those hot dogs?

- [Mouthing Words]
In this petty pace
from day to day and all...
- our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.
- Hey, Frankie, whatcha watchin'?
- Hey, does he get the girl?
I mean, what happens?
- Shut up, you little rodent.
Hey, man, this stuff
is boring, man.
Come on, let's watch some boxing.
I wanna see some action.
[Laughing] Hey, Frankie.?? Que paso?
You're getting slow, man.
- [Laughs]
- My name is Francis.
Fran-cis.
Not Frank.
Not Frankie.
Francis.
No kidding, man? Hey, so what did you
bring in today, "Frahn-cees"?
It's none of your business,
you intrusive little pipsqueak.
Look what I got.
Oh, good show, Einstein. Now all
we need is the court and the net.
You think this place
is big enough?
Hey, come on. What we need is some
good quality stuff, man.
- Check it out.
- Oh, shredded leather.
Shredded wha... What you talkin'about,
man? That's a primo wallet, man.
- Rubbish, you mean.
- All right, that does it, Frankie, man!
You insulted my pride!
That means death!

Behold. The runt of the litter.
- Cut it out, you two.
- Frankie! Frankie!
- Atf!
Fagin's not gonna be too happy about
this. Francis, you got the food, right?
- Well, no. I...
- Ooh, Frankie.
- Frankie. It was your turn
to get the food today.
- Frankie.
- It's newspaper burritos again!
- [Dodger] Hey.
Whoa. Whoa.
Cool it, Dodger fans.
I'd like to introduce you to...
your dinner.
- Hot dogs a la Dodger.
- Hot dogs! All right, Dodger man!
[Francis]
You remain our preeminent benefactor.
[Einstein]
Yeah. And you're okay too.
[Female Dog] So how'd you do it
this time, Dodgie baby?
Let me tell you, Rita. It was tough.
Only I could have done it.
Did you have to fight, man?
Did you fight? How many were there?
Picture the city.
Eighth and Broadway.
The crowds hustling.
The traffic roaring.
The hot dogs are sizzling.
I love a story with food in it.
Enter Dodger,
one bad puppy.
Not just out for himself,
but community minded.
But he's not
the only one out there.
- Enter the opposition.
- [Sighs]
- A greedy, ugly, psychotic monster...
- [Gulps]
With razor-sharp claws,
dripping fangs,
and nine lives,
all of them hungry.
He comes at me, eyes burning.
I knew my time had come.
- Suddenly...
- [Screeches]
Gang war! Gang war!
- Watch out! Here comes a gang war!
- [Francis] Take cover.
[Grunting]
Well, what is it?
Hey, man, check it out.
[Sniffing]
Aye, it's a alien!
Cool it, guys.
It's just a cat.
- !? Mi madre, un gato!
- Feles domesticus!
Now, how'd you
find this place, cat?
I... I... I followed
this dog.
- He's lying! He's lying!
He's lying! He's lying!
- Shut up, Tito!
- Why would a cat follow a dog?
- Yeah?
I-I just wanted some of the sausage
I helped him get.
He's a spy, man! Come on,
let's eat him. You're dead meat, kitty.
I-I saw him come down.
Hey! That's... Hey,
that's him! O-Over there.
- Hmm?
- Hey, kitty. What took you so long?
- [Rita] Relax, kid.
- [Dogs Laughing]
Dodger,
razor-sharp claws?
- Dripping fangs?
- I kind of like those burning eyes.
Hey, keep it down, guys.
The game's on.
Oh, boy, Dodger. Top dog has
to get help from a cat. [Giggling]
Hey, Tito, cool it, man.
- Come on. Let's see this big,
bad kitty fight in action.
- Hey, Tito, look!
[Shouts]
Oh, boy! Dog pile!

- Oh, what a bunch of overgrown... Oof!
- All right. That's it.

Sykes will be here any minute.
[Whimpers] And I don't have...
- No, no, no, no, no!

No, no. Stop it.
No. No.
No licking.

All right, all right.
I'm coming.

I'll be right there.
You guys, listen.
Don't let me down.
What do you got?
Let's see what you got.
[Gasps]
It's worthless! What have you done?
Oh, how are we ever going

Company.
Nice doggies.
I was just on my way out.
[Both Laughing]
You guys... miss us?
Mr Sykes. I, uh...
[Stammering]
He's gonna kill me.
[Chuckles]
Hello. Oh, lovely evening.
I was just saying this
to your two lovely,
- purebred Dobermans.
- The money, Fagin.
Actually, I've got something
much better than money.
Some luxury items that should make
a considerable dent in my debt to you.
Oh, my!
You waxed your car, didn't you?
Did they use the buffer on it,
because I can see myself.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I don't want
your garbage, Fagin!
Oh, please, Sykes.
Oh, please. Oh, please.
I don't think you grasp...
the severity
of the situation.
Oh, no!
Oh, no, I did grasp it.
This is how I grasp. Look.
[Screams, Stammering]
Accident.
Accident!
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
- Mr Fagin!
- Sorry.
Now, I lent you money
and I don't see it.
Do you know what happens when
I don't see my money, Fagin?
- [Wheezing]
- People get hurt.
- People like you get hurt.
- [Gasps]
- Do I make myself clear?
- [Coughs]
[Squeaking]
Clear! Perfectly clear!
Ya know, Rita,
I can't figure out...
why you'd rather hang around
a dump like this...
when you could be living uptown
with a class act like myself.
Isn't it rather dangerous to use one's
entire vocabulary in a single sentence?
[Laughing] Hey, Frankie, get down,
brother. You bad, man.
- Hey, you got something
to say to me, fat boy?
- [Stammering]
Come on, you guys don't scare me.
I'll kill you both.
- Come on, let me at 'em! [Growling]
- [Doberman Chuckles]
Go ahead. Let him go.
Why don't you pick
on someone your own size?
- Like you, old man?
- [Dodger] Hey, Roscoe.
Roscoe, is this us
losing our sense of humour?
Nah. I ain't lost
my sense of humour.
[Crash]
See? I find that funny.
[Chuckles]
Oh, please.
[Crying]
Please.
Oh, please!
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days, Fagin.
Three sunrises.
Three sunsets.
Three days.
Three, three, three. That's nine.
- Nine?
- No, Fagin.
- Three.
- Three!
Oh, you mean,
just three days?
Oh, my goodness!

Get out of my way,
Dodger.
That's enough, Roscoe.
- [Horn Honking]
- [Rita] Run along, Roscoe.
Your master's calling.
- [Growling]
- [Honking]
Come on, DeSoto.
We ain't finished, Dodger.
You guys are gonna pay for this,
starting with that cat.
Oh, yeah? You guys don't scare me!
Come on and say it to my face!
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!
Yeah, those creeps'll think twice
before hassling us, man. [Chuckles]
All right, kid.
What'd I tell you guys?
OI' Dodge can
really pick 'em, huh?
[Door Closing]
Ooh, three days.
[Whimpering]
[Sighs]
How am I ever gonna come up
with all that money? [Crying]
What's the use? I'll never get out
from under that maniac.
[Sighs]
My days are numbered...
and the number is three.
It's hopeless.
Thanks, guys.
[Laughing]
That reminds me.
I saw DeSoto's nose.
Who did that?
You? You.
[Laughing]
That took a lot of guts.

- We've never had a cat
in the gang before.
We can use all the help
we can get.
[Groaning]

- Ahhh. All right.
Time for bed.
We've got a big day tomorrow.
- [Whining]
- Aww, no.
[Chuckles]
Oh, all right.
But just one chapter
tonight.
Umm, let's see.
[Muttering]
Here we are. Here we are.
Chapter seven. [Clears Throat]
"Sparky stopped and he rolled in
a field of wildflowers.
The dandelions tickled
his nose...
- 'til he laughed out loud.
- [Heavy Panting]
And then
something caught his eye.
It was Bumper the rabbit.
Sparky jumped to his feet...
and ran toward Bumper
barking loudly. "
[Weakly]
Woof. Woof.
Well, you try it
sometime.
[Clears Throat]
Ruff! R-Ruff!
Well, that's because
you're a dog.
"Sparky knew that Bumper would run and
that he could chase him over the field.
But Sparky would never catch him
or hurt him...
because Sparky
was not that kind of a dog."
[Snoring]
[Purring]
[Horn Weakly Honking]
This is the big one.
- We've got two days to do or die.
- [Honking]
Dodger, you keep an eye
on the new kid. Show him the ropes.
I don't wanna put any
undue pressure on you, but...
as you march off
to do your duty,
- I want you to keep one thing in mind:
- [Crash]
Dead men do not
buy dog food!
So, big smiles
and get out there...
and fetch!
[Engine Starts]
[All Coughing]
If Mr Sykes don't see some cold,
hard cash soon, we are Doberman chow.
Come on.
We'll start
on Columbus Avenue.
- What kind of work do we do anyway?
- Investment banking, man.
[Grunts] Didn't you read about us
in the Wall Street Journal?
- Really?
- Yes. Captains of Industry.
Gosh! Can I be one too?
Hey. When you got your pals,
you got all ya need.

Mmm.
- Jenny, it's your parents!
- Yeah! Wait 'til I tell 'em!
Oh, yes, sir. I do assure you
everything is absolutely hunky...
Georgette,
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
- Uh, everything's fine here.
- They're gonna be so excited.
- Here she is now.
- [Gasps]
A cat!
What is the meaning
of this? Bark, bark.
Winston!
Bark, bark, bark.
[Seething]
I guess I'll have to handle this myself.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I, um, hope you won't
think me rude,
but do you happen to know...
out of whose bowl
you're eating?
- Yours?
- Ooo.
Aren't you
a clever kitty?
And do you have any idea
whose home this is?
I... thought
it was Jenny's.
Well, it may be
Jenny's house,
but everything
from the doorknobs down is mine!
Oh, Georgette. I see you've
met Oliver. Isn't he cute?
I've got great news.
Mom and Dad just said I could keep him.
I'm sure you two are gonna be
the best of friends.

[Man On TV]
Now for $200...
- Where's the kid?
- We tailed him all the way up the Park.
- [Panting] We never had a chance.
- You should see this place.
There's gotta be,
maybe 200 people livin' there.
We can't let the kid
take the heat for us.
Yeah, man. If we don't get him,
they're gonna torture that kid.
- What in heaven's name
are we waiting for?
- But what about Fagin?
Alas, our
beleaguered benefactor,
bearing the brunt
of our futile endeavours.
Gimme a break.

Francis. Francis.
Francis!
All right, cool it!
Now we got work to do.
First, we'll spring the kid.
Then we'll take care of the old man.

- [Dodger] Tito!

We're here for the kid, remember?
Now let's get him and go.
[All Sniffing]
"I love you, Oliver.
Play with Georgette."
I'd like to play with him, all right!
The little fur ball!
Oooh.
[Screams]
Who are you?
What do you want? Winston!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.
- [Crash]
[Grunting]
Oooh!
[Pans Rattling]
Don't come any closer!
I knew this would happen one day.
You're barkin' up the wrong tree.
It's not you I'm after.
It's not?
It's not!
Well, why not?
What's the problem, Spot?
Not good enough for you?
I mean, do you even know
who I am?
Fifty-six blue ribbons.
Fourteen
regional trophies.
Six-time national champion!
Ooo, and we're all very impressed.
Right, guys?
Very impressed.
[Panting]
- Oh!
- [Kissing]
Allow me to introduce myself. I am
Ignacio Alonzo Julio Frederico de Tito.
Get away from me,
you little bug-eyed creep!
- Winston!
- [Sighs]
- Excuse me, uh, sister. Who's Rex?
- None of your business!
And you, tubby,
off the bed!
- [Sniffing]
- Get away from there, you...
- [Sneezes]
- All right! That does it!
You yo-yos clear out
and I mean now!
Winston!
Bark! Bark!
Relax, champ.
We'll leave as soon as we get our cat.
If you think I'm intimidated by a bunch
of flea-bitten, dog-pound rejects...
Your cat?
[Giggles]
How stupid of me. You must be
the friends he keeps talking about.
- Yes.
- [Winston] Georgette.
Something's not
quite right here.
Shh. Quick.
Before he comes back. Follow me.
Look at him, Dodger. Honey,
let's just forget the whole thing.
No, no, you can't do that!
You don't understand.
- The poor dear's so traumatized.
- [Winston] Georgette.
- Huh? What?
- [Winston] What is going on here?
Now get going. Hurry.
Use the fire escape.

- [Oliver] What?
- Nicejob, Dodger.
- Hey, wait. What's goin' on, you guys?
Just the rescue of the century.
- Should've seen Frankie handle
that butler.
- Rescue?
- [Howling]
- I was rather good, wasn't I?
And how about Tito
and Miss Six-Time National Champion?
Hey, hey, but, wait.
I-I-I don't understand you guys.
- You okay, kid?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, sure he is!
He's back with his Uncle Tito.
I was happy there.
Why did you guys take me away?
We rescued you, kitty.
We, we brought you home.
But... Well, I, I have
another home now.
And someone who loves me.
What do you mean, kid?
You're in the gang.
- But, but...
- The gang means family.
We risked a lot
to get you outta there.
Look, I'm sorry,
but all I ever wanted was...
What? This place is not
good enough for you any more?
Don't wanna mix
with the riffraff?
No, no. I like you. I mean, I like...
I like every one of you, but...
But there was a little girl.
I just wanna go back.
[Sighs]
We never should've took him, Dodger.
- But, Dodger, please...
- You wanna leave? Fine!
There's the door.
- But he just got here.
- Go on. No one's stoppin'ya.
Hey, uh, Dodger, man,
uh, lighten up.
You lighten up!
If he doesn't like it, let him go.

you've been!
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, Oliver.
Your owner probably spends
more money on catnip...
than we do on food
in a month.
He's probably worried
sick about you.
All alone in that big house
with only his money to comfort him.
Only his millions
and millions of dollars to...

That's it! We're saved!

Oliver, I'm home.
That's funny.
Georgette,
help me find Oliver.
Oliver! Oliver!
Oh, where could he be?
Oliver?
He's not here.
Where is he?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Hmm.
"Dear Mister Very Rich
Cat-owner Person.
§§ [Humming]
Whoops.
And if you don't
bring the money,
you'll never see
your cat again."
Oh, no.
Georgette,
something terrible has happened.
- They've kidnapped Oliver.
- [Snickering]
Oh, Georgette,
you loved him too.
- Don't worry.
We're going to get him back.
- [Gasps]
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Fagin] This is an airtight plan,
Sykes. Sweet and simple.
I ransom the kitty, and you
get paid in full tomorrow.
I'll even toss in a little extra
for your patience. [Guffawing]
Whaddya say? It's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.
- [Buzzing]
- [Sykes' Voice] Yeah, who is it?
- Oh...
- [Camera Whirring]
Fagin, it's you.
Why didn't you say so?
[Nervous Chuckling]
Oh! Good question.
But listen... if you're busy,
we can drop by some other time.
Don't be silly.
Just push the door.
[Buzzing]
[Grunting]
I said, push!
Ooh!
What do you mean?
You start with the knuckles.
Ahh, Fagin. Do come in.
I'll be right with you.
- [Door Squeaks]
- Yeah. No,
you don't kill 'im yet.
Huh? Yeah.
And then, what's-what's the last thing
you do? You put on the cement shoes.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Come on. Hey, don't worry about it.
- [Clinking]
- [Slams, Dings]
- So, Fagin.
- Did we bring something green
and wrinkly to make me happy?
- Sykes,
I've got an airtight k-kitty...
plan... plan!
It's sweet and simple...
the plan.
- Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Let's just take this from the top.
- [Dogs Growling]
- What... What am I gonna
do with you, Fagin?
- I've got this kitty, you see...
- Fagin.
[Stammering]
- You don't got the money.
- [Snaps]
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- [Snarling]
- Oh... No, no, no!
Stop! Please, Sykes, please!
- [Dogs Growling]
Sykes, I'm getting your money
tonight! It's coming tonight!
Please. It's from a rich cat... I mean,
a cat from a rich family's paying... Ow!
They're coming tonight with the money
I owe you, uuh, to get the cat back!

[Sykes Grunts]
Hey, I think there's hope
for you yet.
Oh-ho!
I'm proud of ya, Fagin.
Yeah, you're startin'
to think big.
You've got 12 hours.
- And, Fagin?
- [Lighter Clicking]
This is your last chance.
[Clicks]
Turn left... right when you get
to the big propeller.
Oh, Georgette,
I can't read this.
It says... No, that...
No, that's not right. It's left.
- Oh, Georgette, where are we?
- [Wheezing]
- [Insect Buzzing]
- I think we're lost.
- [Yelping]
- Stick close, Georgette.
It's creepy down here.
[Foghorn Blowing]
- He's late.
I drew a perfectly good map.
- [Watches Ticking]
Well, there was
a few smudges on it, okay.
I went outside the line with
the green crayon... but not that much.
- Oh, Dodge.
- Fagin] A child could read that map.
Hey, Rita,
they never laid a paw on me.
Ooh, wait. What if he comes
and he's huge and mean?
- Excuse me, sir.
- [Yelping] It's the F.B.I.!
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! I was framed!
Oh-ho-ho! Whaa...
[Groans]
[Wheezing]
Listen, little girl,
this is a tough neighbourhood.
- You'd better go home.
- [Kissing Sounds]
- Uuugh!
- I can't.
- I'm lost.
- Aw, gee.
Lost. Well.
I'd help you,
but I'm kind of busy right now.
What're you doin'
down here anyway?
I came to find my kitty.
- Your kitty?
- Somebody stole 'im.
But-But, uh,
are you sure?
- Maybe you made a m-m-mistake.
- No.
- No, somebody stole him
and sent me this note.
- [Dogs Growling Lowly]
- [Exhales] Easy, boys.
- See? Now I'm lost.
- I even brought this to get him back.
- [Coins Clinking]
Oh-ho-ho-ho-hoo!
You brought a piggy bank.
- That's all I have.
- That's awful.
I know. And what kind of a person
would steal a poor, little kitty?
But I...
I mean, maybe he...
Maybe he was up against the wall;
at the end of his rope.
[Sobbing]
He must have been
a poor, desperate man.
It's still wrong!
I'm so scared. I don't know what to do.
