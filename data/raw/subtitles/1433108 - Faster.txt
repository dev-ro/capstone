I have fought

Above all,
I will be someone who listens to you.
The choice is simple,

MAN 1 :
In local news, a Henderson man
is fighting for his life

at a gentlemen's club.
The man is suffering

MOTHER:
How Iong you been out?
CoupIe of days.
And why are you here?
Came here to kiII the oId man.
Why?
Because he set us up.
What makes you think that?
Gary went to him for advice
on the bank job
and he wanted fuII share.
Gary wouIdn't give it to him.
So do you think
the oId man was capabIe
of murdering his own son?
Yeah.
No.
Mm-mm.
Nope.
He couIdn't have.
What makes you so sure?
I just... I just know.
TeII me.
Say it.
Mom.
Because...
he Ioved your brother too much.
I'm sorry.
And that's the truth
and that's not your fauIt.
It wasn't Iike
I couId pretend you were his.
He was reminded of that
every time he Iooked at you.
You never stood a chance.
Sorry that I couIdn't...
That I didn't protect you.

Gary was the onIy one
who ever cared for me.
Why'd he puII you in on that job?
You were never a part
of what they did.
When his driver feII out,
I voIunteered.
Why?
He owed the wrong peopIe
a Iot of money.
And he needed me.
If it wasn't the oId man,
then who set us up?

[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY

EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]:
Driven by his passions and desires.
You will never truly be free
unless you freely forgive.
Hate is like a chain
around your neck
that leads you to places
you don't wanna go.
It'll lead you into darkness
and desolation.
You become a slave
to that hatred,
and it'll only lead
to your own destruction.
You must break free.
WOMAN: Hey, cowboy.
You okay, man?
COP: Yeah.
MAN 1 : You Iaid eyes on him at Ieast.
Hey, weII done.

I gotta caII you back.

Good Iead, cowboy.

Yeah.

Got something I wanna show you.
I think we may have caught a break.
You said ''we'' again.
I did.
CICERO:
Our Iatest victim was a CI too.
COP:
So aII three are informants.
CICERO:
Mm-hm. AII got records,
armed robbery, rape, assauIt.
But none did any serious time.
They aII snitched their way
out of the joint over and over.
What are the odds of that?
SIim and none.
I'm waiting on

COP: Who are these?
Former accompIices of the victims.
Let's spIit them up, check them out.
I'II take these.
EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]:
And I know there's not a man,
woman or child in this church today
that has not sinned.
But God did not bring you down
on this Earth to be perfect. No.
God wants you down here
to be saved.
[CROWD CHEERS ON RADIO]
And when you're down with God,
God is eternally down with you.

EVANGELIST [ON RADIO]:
When Jesus knew his time was near,
when he knew he was gonna die,
when he knew they would not take
that cup from his lips,
his thoughts were not
upon his own.
His thoughts were for those
that he loved.
WOMAN: Amen.
EVANGELIST: That's right.
His thoughts were for those
that he loved, preparing them.
EVANGELIST:
Why is that?
He used the exampIe of his birth.
That's right. Here it is.
Jesus toId them how a woman
goes through pain and sorrow
in the throes of chiIdbirth.
But then as soon
as she has deIivered,
there is no more anguish.
[CHEERING]
After aII the screaming,
after aII the pushing,
after aII the bIood and the tears,
there's onIy joy that a new chiId
has been born.

I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.
You've been the subject
of many of my sermons
these past few days.
I heard.
You heard.
But did you Iisten?
Everything okay,
baby?
Everything's just fine,
honey.
I was just catching up with
an oId acquaintance.
You go on home now.
Let's take a waIk.
[???]
Was that your son?
Adopted.
One of five.
Wayward boys.
Not unIike me or you
at that age.
You turned your Iife around.
Doesn't change
what you did.
I wouIdn't want it to.
I know it sounds coId,
but every good I've done
hinged on the eviI I did.
Who set us up?
I don't know.
I never did find out
how they knew about
your safe house.
When I got the caII,
''Easy money,'' they said.
AII I had to do
was guard the door,
be the Iookout.
I was in a dark pIace
in my Iife.
Numb to the chaos and--
Right here.
But when they cut
that boy's throat...
Oh, Jesus, man. No.
That boy they kiIIed was my brother.
I can't bring him back.
And in my heart I'm sorry.
I stiII took my cut,
spent it on drugs and women.
Ended up in prison.
But it was there
that I found my caIIing.
To save and heIp boys Iike me.
And Iike you.
It was there
that I gave my Iife to God.
God can't save you from me.
But maybe he couId save you
from yourseIf.
I know there's good--
You don't know me.
I know the deviI
got your heart twisted
with vengeance and hate.
The Lord is mercifuI.
He sees in your souI.
FragiIe, ain't it?
That moment, that sets us
on our road to Damascus.
Sermon's over.
Can you at Ieast find it in your heart
to forgive me for what I did?
I can't.
That's aII right.
That's aII right.
Because I forgive you
for what you're about to do.

They're here. Both of them.
What? Did you caII for backup?
There's no time for that.
Okay, don't do this.
I'm sorry
I keep stepping on your case.
CICERO: I don't care about that.
Want you to do me a favor.
If I don't make it out of this,
teII my son that
his daddy went out Iike a man.
I am on my way.
PIease, just wait for me.
I'm just going with the fIow.

Aren't you gonna

Come on.

I've got nothing against you.
I've been trying to kiII you for days
and you've got nothing against me?
I'm starting to think you don't
take me very seriousIy, friend.

What do you want from me?
How about a IittIe respect? Hey?

Some acknowIedgment

You've got issues.

[KILLER CHUCKLES]

You can't put it together, can you?
There must be one more.
The one who hired me.
He's stiII aIive.
I'm gonna kiII you aII.
Drop the gun.
Don't move.
SIowIy.
Put the gun down.
No.
Put the goddamn gun down.
No! This is my job!
I finish my job.
How you gonna finish this
when you're dead?
So you're the guy that hired me.
You shouIdn't
have done that.
I had to finish what I started.
Why'd you hire me then?
I didn't think I was up to it.
After you missed him,
I figured I shouId get invoIved
before he came gunning for me.
He didn't even know about you.
I figured that out when
he didn't finish me off
at the hospitaI.
His brother's girIfriend
was my informant down in L.A.
She toId me about the job.
Hired some more of my informants
down there.
They helped me take down
their score.
So, what now?
Now?
I ride off into the sunset.
Hey.
I forgot to pay you.
You know,
I don't get you.
Why do you put yourseIf
through aII this shit
for one Iousy doIIar?
It's my price.
CaII it a hobby.
You know what, keep it.
I didn't earn it.
Don't contact me again,
