What are you doing kids?
Ouch!
Guys, no woman can resist my
wild charm.
- Saban!
>- What?
- What did you do again?
- What did I do my dear Güdük?
- You hurt a girl's
feelings again!
- No way.
- Yeah!
Did I?
Yeah, I do!
And you got the poor girl
knocked up.
Wooow...
- She has left fruit of your love
and gone away. - What fruit?
- Your child idiot, your child!
- What? My child?
- Where is my child?
- Look! Here.
Looks just like the father,
isn't it?
Admit it Cow,
it's yout child!
Güdük, I'll kill you
this time...
...there is no way
you're getting out of this alive.
Fellas!
I need you to help me...
... so that I can kill Güdük, fire!
Güdük, you asshole!
Let me!
Don't stop me!
Don't you stop me!
Cow! Your son is running away!
Let him run!
What the hell do you have
to do with my son?
This time I get to choke him,
now he is dying...
- Don't do it Saban!
- Guys, Nuri Hoca!
Look at your selves, you tramps!
What is here, a stall?
Back to your seats!
Ready! Set!
Rascals Class is ready for your
attention with 39 members, sir!
What kind of a report is that!
Sit down!
Take out you papers,
you have an exam!
Whoops!
Where the hell did this come from, now?
Güdük, do your thing
and let's get rid of this exam.
All right.
Sir!
What is it?
My honorable sir!
Say it son!
What's wrong son?
Why are you crying?
Mahmut Hoca, sir,
is going to...
...quiz me.
Haven't you studied?
Of course I have.
I've got the whole book
in my head.
However, I never got to learn about
The Grand Battle.
And I'm a child of a soldier.
Don't cry, my son!
Who else to cry if not me.
I said don't cry,
you're gonna make me cry.
- I can tell you about it.
- Tell me, sir.
Yeah, you'd better tell him,
or else he's gonna cry!
Those were the glorious days!
I never forget.
26 August 1922.
A Saturday morning.
We were on the battlefield in Kocatepe.
Just like that.
Fingers on triggers,
eyes on the horizon...
...waiting for order to attack.
Canon fire started by the dawn.
Bum! Bum! Bum!
We started crawling up to the hill.
Preveze Sea Battle took place...
Just like this.
All of a sudden, attack siren started.
Here is it!
I, Mülazim Evvel Nuri, took my sword...
...ordered my team.
Bayonet on, Attack!
Allah! Allah! Allah! Attack!
We're headed to Kocatepe!
- Attack!
<- Flow the enemy to the sea, my lions!
Well... Mahmut Hoca!
What's going on, sir?
What are you doing?
We're attacking. I was just telling
my students about The Grand Battle.
Sir, aren't you a Physics teacher?
Yes, and I was making
a written exam.
Take out your papers!
Ohh sir! Shouldn't you be
doing it in the classroom?
So, isn't here the classroom?
No! It's teacher's room.
Then, what am I doing here
in teacher's room?
Actually that is
what I'm wondering.
Where was I this summer?
How the hell are we
supposed to know!
I'm asking you,
Where was I this summer?
- Saban! Tell me where I was?
- Well, you might be in Kayseri.
- No!
- Malatya?
- No!
- Gaziantep
Kahramanmaras!
No son, this direction.
Edirne?
- That's right, go outside.
- Alright, sir.
Well, that was easy.
Stop!
Go outside of the national border!
Ohh!
- France maybe.
- Yeah!
- Keep going.
- Spain.
- Go through the ocean.
- I can't.
- Why is that?
- Well, I can't swim...
...I'd drown, sir.
-Idiot, fly then!
- OK, I'm flying.
- Yes... Where are you now?
- Where am I?
- Just tell me.
- You just tell me.
- Come on...
- Come on, come on.
Dipshit!
Go to your place.
I was right here!
- In Montreal
In Olympic Games!
Thank God!
He finally said it.
Yes, I was here.
And... I came back
with a broken heart.
Think about it... National anthems of all
nations were played...
...but ours, ours...
Our flag wasn't ran up.
Don't cry sir!
You're gonna make me cry.
He's crying!
- Wasn't our flag run up?
- No, it wasn't.
Hey! Moron!
Why are you crying?
Because you're crying.
You know, it's so touching.
- Back to your place!
- Right.
But, I understood that...
...this can't be solved
only by crying.
Why wouldn't one you,
be an Olympic Champion?
Tell me! Why not?
You can make it!
You can make it but...
... only by hardworking.
Gentlemen,
this is called trampoline.
You're going to bounce on it
and jump.
High! Higher.
The Highest!
However...
You should know hot to stop.
Private Camlica Lisesi.
Last question.
I, for instance, can't stop right now.
I can't stop, stop me.
So, what are we supposed to do...
We should stop properly.
Come with me.
- Saban!
<- What!
- What is this called?
- How should I know?
- Javelin, javelin.
- Right, Javelin.
- Come on, throw it!
- Why? Don't we need it?
- Throw it!
- Ok, I'll throw it.
- Back off.
- Back off!
You might lose your eye.
LOL! Why wasn't he able
to throw it far away?
Because he doesn't know how to.
Infact, no one in entire world
knows how to throw it.
Here, today we are going to...
...try a new throwing style
for the first time.
And my name is going to be
written in the history.
I'm going to
throw the javelin by drilling.
Just like this.
One!
Two!
Three!
Which immodest
threw this javelin in?
I did!
Excuse me Mahmut Hoca.
There has been a small mistake.
This year, I am going to be
your teacher for Literature Class.
My name is Zühtü.
I really don't like the word "new".
Especially in literature,
I particularly don't like it.
Literature means,
Ottoman Divan Literature.
Means Ottoman Divan Poetry.
And Ottoman Divan Poetry
means, verse and rhyme.
Without rhyme
there can be no poem.
Several people have done
something called "free verse".
Yes, sir.
But we are not going to read those.
We are not.
I'm not going to be asking
them in my exams neither.
Don't forget, the best
the greatest and the most accurate...
What language is this guy talking?
...poet is the silence beneath
the influence of wisdom.
Yes, sir.
Which is Ottoman Divan Poetry.
- What the heck is this
Zühtü Hoca talking about?
- I have no idea.
Must be something like Chinese.
- Sir!
-What is it?
Our former Literature Teacher
Semra Hanim used to teach us...
...also the Modern Literature.
No way! Nothing new!
Forget all of it.
Anyway, where were we?
Ottoman Divan Poetry, meaning pattern ...
...meaning rhyme, look at this flawlessness.
Listen carefully.
Sche, who is in a hurry
fluffs upon hir own föt.
You! You you you, stand up!
Repeat it.
She, who isn't a ferry...
...blows her own foot.
Stop! You coarse man.
Don't you blush a little?
Sit down!
Now, this one is another
lovely line.
Sceawian the ansien of freond
betweonan thy fine bru.
- Yes, who's going to repeat it?
- I, sir.
Go ahead.
Stop being silly, fool...
...wrap your willy, bro.
Sit down you cheeky cracker
- He is right, you're a crecker.
- Screw you!
- You, the babbler. Stand up!
- Is he talking to me?
- Repeat what I say.
- Yes sir.
Keep hir holy sheet,
to be gritten over flower.
- We have to run, sir!
- Why is that?
Well, keeper Hursit
has been given a revolver...
...he might shoot us all.
Look at me!
Oh God! What was that?
Don't worry, sir,
new Chemistry teacher...
...has been trying experiments...
...stuff like this happens
quite often naturaly.
I was also scared at first,
then got used to it. All fine now.
- Sevket Bey are you ok?
- Good good
- What, what happened?
- Sevket Bey, did it again!
What, what did he do?
- Chemistry Laboratory, boom!
- Good good.
Hafize Hanim, can we
change this lab coat please.
Sure, sure but...
...we're about to run out of lab coats.
Here, sir!
- How's the damage Sevket Bey?
- Unfortunately, all the tubes are gone.
Let's see are we going to explain it
this time to the Manager.
Oh my!
I still can't see how it happened.
- This was the sixth explosion.
- No, seventh actually! Here.
Potassium was a little much,
I guess.
Anyway, experiment is experiment.
Not experiment, son.
Experience, experience.
I didn't understand!
How can you not understand?
Science of Chemistry...
...is all about a positive surface which consist
of experiences.
Yeah!
Mahmut Bey!
I never get to understand ...
...what this new generaiton says.
Why, sir?
I can't understand what this
fine, gentlemen scientist...
talks about.
To be honest Zühtü Bey,
sometimes I also...
...can't understand what
you're talking about.
I can't tell you
how I missed you all.
I never forget about you
here at the army.
Infact my military duty
is pretty easy.
Oh my little boy! Look how nice
he looks in that uniform.
After the boot camp,
I stayed here as a transcriber.
I'll be visiting you as soon as
I get my first day off.
Come, come and I'll cook
all your favourite meals.
Oh my little boy!
My little soldier.
What are you doing Saban?
Smoke with gun powder in it.
I have a plan...
...to kill Güdük.
Don't forget to write
back to him for me to night.
- Alright Güdük?
- Ok.
- What's that Saban?
- Güdük, help me...
...to get on top of that tree.
- Alright, come on!
Come here fatso.
What are you going to do
up there?
Mahmut Hoca never
gives a break anywhere.
He can't find me
on top of a tree.
You, Saban are
the Smartest of all cows
Finally! Let me get a
nice smoke in the fresh air.
- Saban!
- Yes!
Pass me a smoke.
You wish. Forget it.
Stop being mean, come on
Saban pass me a smoke.
Alright, come up here.
But this is the last time.
Fine fine, last time.
Come on give me the smoke.
Here you go buddy.
Take a deep smoke.
And here is your fire.
Light it up!
- Güdük, were you scared buddy?
- You lousy cow, never forget this.
Come in!
Mahut Hoca!
Yes.
Do you remember me?
Of course I do.
How can I forget you?
Let me kiss your hand, sir.
Ohh please. You're such a
grown up man, Ahmet.
- Years go by in a blink.
- You haven't changes a bit, sir.
- No, I have.
- How's your father?
- He has passed away, sir.
- Ohh! My condolences to you.
Come on, don't stand there,
sit here.
It's such a suprise to see you.
Well, your father
has passed away.
Ahmet, by the time
I left Konya Highschool...
...which grade were attending?
- 3rd grade, sir.
Oh right!
Were you able to keep on then?
Since my dad passed away,
I had to quit the school.
Yeah, It's hard to study
without a father nowadays.
I used to love your dad,
he was a great man.
He was.
He used to love you too.
So, what are you
planning to do now?
I came to you. I thought,
Mahmut Hoca can help me.
Of course I do.
What would you like to do?
Anything, I can even
clean the floors.
- It's our family business anyway.
- No way!
Actually...
You have to study, Ahmet.
I wish I could,
but how?
Wait, let me talk
to the Manager.
Mahmut Hoca are you
out of your mind?
You know that,
business isn't well already.
How can we let
someone study for free?
Let's just lock the door
and leave the shop.
But he's a very
talented student, sir.
It's goint to be such a shame.
You could have helped him.
Don't be ridiculous Mahmut Hoca,
life's getting more expensive.
How do yo think this
institution runs?
Alright then.
I'll pay his instalments.
Mahnut Hoca,
are you insane?
Who would give away
their money today?
If you don't mind,
it's my decision to make.
Well, you'd better
think again, I don't care...
where the money comes from,
as long as it keeps coming.
You're right.
Mighty Lord!
You have such fool
slaves in this world!
I'm coming, dear sir!
Tell us!
Ancient History Philosophers.
Ancient History Philosophers...
To be honest, Ancient History
is full of philosophers.
There are a lot of
Ancient History Philosophers.
Give me a name, son, a name!
Who is the most important one?
- Who?
- Take this Cow, page twenty!
Page twenty, right?
Thank you Güdük.
- So, tell us son!
- Check this out!
The most significant kind is Montafon.
There is also Swiss Brown Cow.
Provides 27lt milk per day.
These are very precious cows.
- There cows usually...
- What cow! You insolent man.
- You Güdük, gave me a
Biology book, instead of Philosophy!
- Asshole!
- Go to your place!
Enough with this nonsense.
I'm going to talk to your father.
Or else you'll never
attend my class again...
...and fail at it.
Don't show up without
your father next time.
Sir, time's up.
- Sir, times's up.
- I heard.
Good.
You screwed
me big time, Güdük.
If my dad ever hears
about this, and I'm dead.
What am I gonna do?
No worries Saban,
I'll figure a way out.
Will you?
Of course Saban, am I not your
best buddy?
Oh dear, come here.
Kids, sit down for minute.
Ahmet come here.
I brought you
a new friend.
- His name is Ahmet.
- Ahmet.
His father is a very
good friend of mine.
He's a nice, smart,
decent person.
Don't you ever try to make
him like yourselves.
You can't make it anyway.
By the way, I hope that,
you won't try any of your...
...new guy pranks
on him.
Is that clear gentlemen?
Go ahead,
meet your friends Ahmet.
- Hi, I'm Ahmet.
- Heard it already, we're called The Rascals.
- Called what?
- The Rascals dummy, The Rascals.
- So, you're pretty closed
to Mahmut Hoca huh?
- Yes, I like him very much.
Look dude,
we don't like him at all.
- So, are you a Prodigy?
- Nope.
Look at him,
he's genius.
My my, such a
sweet boy.
- You got a fire?
- Nope.
Then have no
cigarette either.
I don't smoke!
- What?
- Aah! He doesn't smoke.
Look dude, this is called
The Rascals Class.
Whoever comes here,
has to smoke too.
And cheats on exams.
And escapes from school.
I don't do that kind of stuff.
Oh yes, you do sweetheart,
you do honey, you do.
Come on light one up.
No, I don't smoke.
Look, we don't give a smoke
for free everyday.
- Isn't that right Güdük?
- Oh yeah!
- Take this.
Thank you.
But I don't even know
how to smoke it.
Look buddy, either you smoke it
or get the hell out of here.
- This is it, smoke it.
- That's right, or you're out.
Alright, fine then!
How do I smoke it?
Look, this is the end.
Alright kiddo, alright.
Come, have a seat.
Sit down and make yourself
comfortable.
Light it up.
Just light it up.
Don't be afraid, ok.
What's going on?
- What are you doing Ahmet?
- Smoke
- I can see that!
- He says he's an addict, Mahmut Hoca.
Can't do it without smoking.
It gives him migraines if he doesn't.
He says so.
I know pretty well
who are the addicts.
- Why did you smoke it Ahmet?
- Sir, this is the first time.
I know.
Look at me, do not try to
make Ahmet one of you.
You can't do it anyway.
This is never going to
happen again, Ahmet.
Aren't you going to punish him, sir?
No punishment?
Infact you are the ones
to be punished, not Ahmet.
- Come on, please Hafize Ana.
- Don't push it guys, I said no.
- Don't turn us down, Hafize Ana.
What do I know about
teaching, anyway?
Come on Hafize Ana,
what's hard about it.
Come on Hafize Ana.
You are going to be
the History Teacher for lesson.
- Come on
don't turn us down.
- No way, I can't do it.
What do you want
from poor kid, anyway?
Sweet God!
It's just a joke Hafize Ana.
Right?
Sure. Does Ahmet know you?
Has he ever seen you?
Nope, he hasn't.
Great then.
When you step in to the classroom,
we're all going to stand up.
He'll think that
you are the Teacher.
And we're gonna laugh at the fool, a little.
I don't even look like a teacher.
Come on Hafize Ana, you can get
your sunday clothes on.
Oh God, what if
Mahmut Hoca sees me?
How many times do we
have to repeat it?
It'll be at idle time.
No one will notice.
Come on!
- Which class is this one?
- History.
A lesson from Hafize "The Zero Queen"
- How is she?
- She sucks, she's been killing us all.
Psst, she's coming!
Sit down!
Pick up your books
and notebooks.
Take out your papers!
Pop quiz.
She's unpredictable.
See, she started as written exam
then decided to make a pop quiz.
Quiet!
You cannot fool me.
I'm like no one else.
- You! What are you
talking about, there?
- I'm not talking ma'am.
Look at this
disrespectful liar.
Get up, to the board!
- Come on, move it!
- Yes ma'am.
- What's your name?
- Ahmet ma'am.
- What's your student number?
- I don't know ma'am.
What do you mean "I don't know"
are you stupid?
I just registered,
they haven't given me one yet.
You cannot fool me, tell me.
Tell you what?
- What should he tell?
- History.
- History!
- What history, ma'am?
Look at him, say's "What history".
You ask.
Tell about the period
Fatih Sultan Mehmet.
- Yes, tell about it.
- Ok, ma'am.
- Fatih...
- Who the hell is Fatih?
- The Sultan.
- What sultan, you jackass?
Ma'am, ma'am told me
to tell about him.
What's that hand, huh?
Are you gonna hit me?
- No ma'am, not at all.
- Shut up!
Saban, get up and
tell us about Fatih.
Well done, Saban.
Sit down.
Look how prepared he is.
I can see it in his eyes.
10!
An you have a 0.
Mr. Inspector we are doing
everything we can...
...only to provide a better
education to our kids.
We even perfected
our teachers.
- I'm sure.
- Thank you, sir.
Would you drink a coffee?
Don't bother please.
I'd like to see the classes
as soon as possible.
Ceratainly.
Mahmut Bey will help you.
This way please, Mr. Inspector.
You all have to learn
the History!
Or you are going to make it
to the next year!
I'm not like Foolproof...
...or Akil or Mahmut.
Oh dear!
Sit down my friends.
- Mahmut Hoca, I thought
you said it was idle time.
- Well, I think I was mistaken, sir.
What does this lady teach?
History, Mr Inspector.
- History?
- Yes.
Go on, ma'am.
Go on, doing what?
- Where were you?
- What kind of question is that?
In the classroom.
No ma'am,
I mean at the history.
- Where are we?
- Balkan Wars.
- Looks like Balkan Wars.
- Yes...
- In 1912...
- In 19 what?
- Are asking me?
- 1912.
- 1912 he says.
Four Balkan countries
were in battle.
Four countries, all in battle.
- Ma'am.
- Yes Mr. Inspector.
If you don't mind, I'd like to
ask a couple of questions.
Well, sure.
Well, well.
You!
- Stand up.
- Me?
- What are these
Balkan countries?
- What countries?
To be honest, there have been
some rumours about this.
It's unclear what
countries these are.
- What is he talking about ma'am?
- He says it's unclear.
- What is unclear?
- Tha Balkan countries.
- These countries happen to be
pretty wide...
- How many are they?
Ohoo, a lot.
There is 30 maybe 40 of them.
Ma'am he says 30-40!
That's wrong sir. I've told him that
there are 100-150 of them.
Sometimes even 200 of them.
- What is he talking about?
- He's doing quite good actually.
Good boy.
- War!
- Did the war begin?
God, let me go, stock
some food.
- No, Balkan War!
- Oh! Balkan War.
That was an awesome war,
just like a blood bath.
Those who were injured,
were crying out.
Poor soldiers, some has to
help them to go to the hospital.
Forget about the hospital,
go og with the war!
They forgot about
the hospital and
went on with the war.
Kids were running around and
crying out; "Daddy, daddy!"
Poor little ones.
All of a sudden chevaliers
started to ride towards the kids.
- Get them out of the way!
- I can't chevalier are coming.
- Who the hell put those kids in to a war?
- I swear to God, I didn't.
Haven't I told you not
to put kids in to the war?
Look at this Mahmut Pasha.
I mean...
Pasha Mahmut.
Ermm... Sir Pasha.
Pasha, my Pasha...
In this Balkan War,
kids a Pashas are all
mixed up, Mahmud Pasha!
Well... Mahmut.
I feel sick.
Everytime I visit this class,
something happens to me.
Excuse me.
If you ever involve Hafize
to your games again,
I'll fire her.
- You just don't be one of them.
- Okay, Mahmut Hoca.
Now go.
God bless you.
Sir!
Ahmet should also be
here with us.
Why isn't he on penalty?
Because he is not lazy
and irresponsible like you.
But...
This makes our blood boil, Mahmut Hoca.
Jackass.
Where the hell did you
come from, you little jerk!
Stop smirking and get lost!
Don't you ever
stand on two feet?
Look, I'm gonna hang you
by your feet if I get you.
This Manager comes with
a new thing every year!
And now we have to
serve our food to our selves.
God knows, maybe we're gonna
start washing dishes next year.
What can I do son,
I can't do them all by myself.
- You're right, it's all that
Scrooge Managers fault.
Like he would have gone
bankrupt if he hired
one more worker.
Yummy, the soup is delicious.
Go ahead Ahmet, eat it?
Add a little salt, if you'd like.
No, thank you.
Oh, oh!
- What is it Ahmet?
- I got wet.
- Why did you do that?
- Don't you have little
sense of humour, boy?
- This is a Rascal joke.
- Deal with it Ahmet.
Deal with it.
Hmm, potatoes look nice.
Damn! There isn't
a piece of meat in it again.
Scrooge, The Manager.
- Everyone got some, right?
- We did, yeah.
Oh no, none left for Ahmet!
Ahmet, looks like not
your lucky day.
Here is a piece of Potato for you.
Here you go, it's all yours.
- Bon appetit.
That's ok.
I wasn't really hungry anyway.
What is it, Ahmet?
What don't you eat?
Ran out of food sir,
none left for me.
Why are you lying dude?
Haven't you just told us
that you didn't like the food?
Yes he said,
he'd rather watch us eating.
Isn't that right brother?
Isn't that?
I see, I'll see you in the evening.
What did Descartes say?
"I think, therefore I am."
- Come in.
Dear Güdük, looks
just like my father.
Who are you, what do you want?
Sir, I'm Saban's father.
I suppose you asked for me.
Mister, I've a lot to complain
about your son Saban.
Why is that sir?
Has he done something wrong?
First of all he's lazy.
Doesn't care about classes at all.
Oh, I can' believe it!
Saban come here quick.
Sure daddy.
- Let me kiss your hand.
- Let me kiss you too.
- Saban.
- What?
- Look what your teacher says.
- What does he say?
- Says you don't care
about your classes.
- I don't?
- Isn't that such a shame
my beloved son?
- Sure it is.
- I'm have to punish you then.
- Ouch, what the hell are you doing?
- Psst, shut up.
Don't get him suspicious
- Oh, right.
Sir, what else
has this one done?
- Countless to mention.
- Hmm...
Look, I'm getting a little
upset here...
Don't be daddy.
- I am!
- Ouch!
- What the hell are you doing!
- You bastard!
- Hey, watch it.
- Psst, keep playing, keep playing.
- You untamed cow!
- I'll show you how it is!
Mister, please
don't get so upset.
- You stay out of this!
- Yes, you stay out of this teacher!
- Don't get in between father and son!
- Yes!
- It was you calling me here...
- Yes!
- You lazy!
- Stop frigging hitting!
- I worked my ass off
to get you educated...
- Stop hitting, asshole!
- And you get lazy here!
- Hey, watch it!
- All these years...
- Dude I'll beat the shit out of you!
- Even cows would have
become gentlemen.
- Enough already!
These kids are killing me.
What happened, sir?
Look at them, should the students
of a veteran player...
...really play like this?
Disaster!
- Ouch!
- Penalty!
Yes, penalty.
I shoot.
On my count.
- Okay, sir.
A little space guys.
Watch it, Güdük is about to die.
Frigging come on Cow!
Shoot it already, will you.
Ouch!

shoot a penalty?
Get out of my way.
Watch and learn!
He's gonna hit me.
Don't stay on my way!
Move!
Move!
Ouch!
So we are done
with the Alcohols.
Let's see if you've
understood them?
- You.
- Me.
Give us an example
for Polyhydric alcohols.
Raki! Jack Daniels.
We could say
Vodka and Cognac too.
Of course you haven't understood them.
Why? Lack of experiments!
Like I've always said;
chemistry without experiments
is unthinkable.
Let's do an experiment, so that you get it better.
- Where is my asistant?
- Tubes?
- Tubes.
Chemistry means, experiment.
And this experiment,
means the death of Güdük.
Why is that?
I'm gonna put gun
powder in to the tube.
So Güdük will blow up.
- Light it son.
- Lighting sir.
- Yes, a little more.
- More, sir.
- Let's heat it.
- We're heating.
- Open it more.
Opened more.
- Nice very, nice.
- Shavings?
- Yes. Shavings.
By mixing, the wood shavings
I put in this tube...
...with heated acid...
- Yes, sir.
...we are going to obtain
methyl alcohol.
- Hopefully.
Here we go, attention!
This time I have no idea
why it exploded.
I neither.
Look how he eats
without even blushing.
What can you say,
he has Mahnut Hoca behind him.
I'm about to die of hunger.
Sir this is not fair!
- Why is that, son?
- Are we going to starve here?
Why would you starve?
Haven't you had your
lunch better than usual?
- You even shared Ahmet's meal.
- But he asked us to.
And this time,
I want him to!
Come on Ahmet!
Keep eating.
Sir I can't really eat
while my friends are hungry.
Don't worry, they are
used to stay hungry.
- By this going they are
going to be starving a lot.
It's delicious Hafize.
I'm so hungry that
I can even eat the toothpaste.
Domdom, you look
a lot slim already.
No kidding, really?
Seriously, I look pretty skinny.
Guy, there are weird sounds
coming out of my stomach.
- What could it be?
- What do you think it is? Hunger!
What the hell are you
doing all over my stuff?
It's not like I'm gonna eat it!
- Dear Saban?
- Yes, my dear Güdük?
What is that?
Pure butter.
Daddy sent it from homeland.
Would you mind
sharing a little with me?
Forget it buddy, no chance.
Not a bite.
Come on, you wouldn't die.
You're such a thickheaded!
I said no!
Don't you touch my bread!
I'll be back.
Only if you were also prepared for
Mahmut Hoca's...
punishments, you
wouldn't be such an underdog.
- I hope it kills you!
- It kills you!
What is it Ahmet?
You look cheery with a full stomach.
What would rich know about
how poor is suffering?
I swear to God I could
hardly eat. You saw me.
- Oh don't be so sensitive.
- You're gonna make us cry.
Stop acting!
You wolfed the whle meal...
...right infront of us!
I couldn't help it,
Mahmut Hoca made me do it.
- Psst look at me. Now!
- Alright!
Hurray!
Yippie!
Ole!
- Are you out of you mind?
You broke the bed!
- It's a first night tradition!
New boys bed gets broken.
- You'll get used to it.
I see. Anyway!
Then I'll be on the ground to night.
- Will you be comfortable there?
- Sure.
We always sleep on
the ground back at my village.
- Are you done Necati?
- Done.
Open it.
- Easy, he shouldn't hear!
- OK.
What is this?
Hafize Ana got it for us.
Potato mash.
We'll replace the butter
with this.

Go sit on your old desk.
- Okay, sir.

Ismail, my man.
- So, tell us. How is the army?
Very well, sir. I'm happy there.
It's nothing like the school.
No classes, no studying, no books.
Allowed to smoke. And our commander
isn't as tough as you.
- So you're happy with your life.
- Oh, I'm happy as a clam.
- Sir, with your permission, I'm leaving.
- Leaving for where, Saban?
- For the army.
One midnight I was on duty.
I felt asleep. And got slapped
by the sergeant to wake up.
- Are you playing poker? On what?
- Beans.
- So, where am I gonna sleep?
- Don't worry about it.
- Ahmet.
- Yes?
- Get up.
Why?
-What do you mean "why"?

since I'm not giving him any.
- Come on then, eat it.
- Saban what's this?
- Pure butter.
- Get out of there. Looks like
your daddy screwed you.
This is nothing but mash.
- Let me have a look.
- Yeah, mash. Dad, you asshole.
- Saban, it's time for you
to learn the truth.
- Your dad is innocent.
- No way? Who is it then?
- Right there. Ahmet. Don't let
his innocent face to fool you.
He whipped all your butter.
- And told us all that its his own.
- Sneaky bastard.
I didn't tell you cause I didn't
want you to do something wrong.
- I'll do something wrong.
- Don't do it, Saban.
- I'll kill that asshole.
- Don't, Saban.
- Don't stop me. Don't stop me.
- Don't do it Saban. Put yourself together.

Asshole. How dare you

You asshole.
It's my dear father's butter.

- So, you're leaving, huh.
- Well, time's up.
- We do we get to see
you next time soldier?
- I don't know. Only if I get
dismissed again.
- If they don't let,
you just sneak off.
- No way, we're talking
about the army.
- We're gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.
I have had such great days here.
You get it after loosing it.
Look at me. You should
appreciate what you have here.
I'd tell you to study and
become someone but
not wasting my breath.
Well, take care Rascals.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Cheating.
- Güdük why are we all
drawing fish?
- Saban it's April 1st today right?
- Yes it is.
Haven't we decided to
joke Mahmut Hoca?
- Yes we did.
- Well we're going to spoil
the lesson with April fools.
Come on draw the fish.

How about a pear?
- Saban.

There is even a song about it.
Tulips... Tulips, tulips.
Tulips... Tulips, tulips.
Sit back! Failed.
You go ahead Necmi.
I completely agree with Saban, sir.
I definitely have nothing to add.
I mean you can't talk about cabbages

Sit down! Failed.
Anybody? The Tulip Period?
We're only ready for
a written exam, sir.
I see.
The whole class have failed!
Kids, what's the date today?

Then let's set the gear up, sir.
No. This year there won't be any

That's right. And I want you
to be embarrassed.

Because of your recklessness
you almost burnt the
entire school down.
You are all grounded
for the rest of the year.
Sir we got that part but
what is this barbed wire for?
Because you won't sit still
and are going to try to break.
This looks like the only
of keeping you inside.
Then we'd better change
the name of this place, sir.
How should we call it, son?
Private Camlica Prison.
Guys are you students
or hard hats?
- None of your friggin business!
- Are you looking for trouble?
How do we get rid of this brat?
Just be patient.
I'll be graduating in 3 years.
Dude, if this guys
graduates before I do,
I'm gonna kill myself.
Here is the school building.
And here is our classroom.
We dig through here.
First the garden...
...then beneath the street,
and we're in the old chalet
across the street.
Everything clear?
Ok, ok, ok...
We'll be digging only during
personal study hours and
free lessons. Come on!
Where is the saw?
Wait a second, why
don't we celebrate this?
What's that Domdom?
Rooster! We'll sacrifice it
for the tunnel.
Great idea but who is going to kill it?
Should be someone clean.
Well, finally you need me.
Give me that.
Why are we killing this
poor rooster instead of Cow?
Yeah.
Asshole.
God forgive me.
Come on then...
In the name of Allah.
Now you're all wondering
why I'm up here.
This building is made of wood
can easily be burnt.
Therefore, I'm going to show you
how to jump...
...safely on to a canvas, in case
of an emergency.
Remember! This is a fire drill.
Dude are we gonna set
school on fire again?
Stretch the canvas.
Yes.
Watch my jumping style carefuly.
One...
Two...
Pasha Nuri is coming!
There...
Attention!
Ouch!
Here what you see is
collar bone. Alright?
What is it?
- Collar bone.
- Nice.
And this is tibia. What is it?
Am I your slave you assholes?
They've disappeared again...
Am I the only one to work,
you sons of bitches?
You Necmi... Tell us about the collar bone.
Errm. Collar bone looks like
a little bridge sir.
Galata Bridge maybe.
An example for big bridges
is Bosphorus Bridge, sir.
Why are you bouncing like that?
Are kidding me?
Don't come! Don't come!
Why should I not come, son?
What are you talking
about Güdük?
Don't come, just go!
Don't be afraid, son.
I won't hurt you.
Get the hell out of there!
I can't come up.
Don't come up! Don't come up!
Go.
Go where?
Just go!
Where?
Sir he's a little nervous.
This happens when he
can't answer the questions....
...I'd like to continue,
if that's ok.
- Ok son, go ahead.
Just don't come up!
It's me, Saban.
You idiot, Foolproof is here.
What? Here?
Oh my dear teacher...
You look so scraggy.
I can even count your bones.
Saban!
Yes, sir.
Where are you?
I'm here but
what happened to you?
Saban.
Stop it.
I'm talking to my teacher.
Saban.
What?
Wait a second, if you're
the Foolproof, who's this?
Dear friends. After a huge
amout of work, we finally made it
to the other side.
Above us is the chalet.
Give me the saw please.
- Here.
- Thank you my dear.
In the name of Allah.
Come here Güdük.
Give me your hand.
Come, my dear.
You're so heavy Domdom.
Mahmut Hoca!
Yeah, Mahmut Hoca.
This is a great victory
of us, against him.
Give me your hand, honey.
Come up. Give me your hand.
Now let him look
for us everywhere.
Saban.
What?
Oh... Mahmut Hoca.
Mahmut Hoca.
Look, he's Mahmut Hoca.
Mahmut Hoca.
He escaped too.
Did you escape too Mahmut Hoca?
We didn't come across
in the tunnel.
Hoca Mahmut.
You see Mahmut?
Oh.. God.
Guys.
You'd better not come.
This end of the tunnel
is kind of fucked up.
Guys, remember;
Whoever Zühtü Hoca picks,
is going to read from this paper.
- Alright?
- Alright Güdük.
Well Zühtü Hoca. This is gona be
something you'll never forget.
Coming.
Sit down.
Agent. Everyone is here, right?
Yes, dear sir.
Not "Dear Sir".
Honorable Sir. Honorable.
Yes...
Have you memorized
the thing I've given
you last time?
Yes, sir.
Perfectly, sir.
Alright.
You had it coming.
Go ahead.
Turkish Youth, your first duty
is to preserve...
...and to defend Turkish
Independence and
the Turkish Republic forever.
What is this?
What are you doing?
Ataturk's Address to Turkish Youth, sir.
Don't be ridiculous.
I've given you the Terkib-i Bent
of Ziya Pasha to memorize.
That's not right, sir.
You've given us the Ataturk.
No way. No way.
I know what I've given.
But sir...
If you don't believe me,
ask my friends.
Yes, sir. Güdük is right.
You have given us
the Address to Turkish Youth.
You've given Ataturk.
Stop it.
I know very well what I've given.
But I bet you morons can't
memorize that thing
you're saying either.
Go to your place.
Come here, you go ahead.
Go in with the Address.
This is the very foundation
of your existence
and your future.
What's that?
Are you in pain?
No, sir.
You're squirming a lot.
Oh, my neck hurts a little.
Hmm... Really?
Continue.
This foundation is your most
precious treasure.
In the future, too...
Enough. Stop it.
Back to your place.
You little cheaters.
You thought that
I'd not notice didn't you?
You go and call
Mahmut Hoca here.
You too, come here.
Give me that over there.
You cheap bastards.
I can't even say your
Dear Ataturk's Address...
...to Turkish Youth,
without chating.
Look to whom Ataturk has
entrusted this country.
More like a herd of dogs,
than youth.
Herd of dogs.
What is it Zühtü Bey.
Mahmut Hoca see to
whom Ataturk has left this country.
What happened sir?
What else should happen?
They've written Atatürk's
Address to Turkish Youth
on this and placed it on my desk.
Reading it from there.
Let's see if they can
read it with out looking,
right in front of you.
Yes.
 Turkish Youth, Your first duty is
to preserve and to defend
Turkish Independence...
...and the Turkish Republic forever. 
This is the very foundation of
your existence and your future.
This foundation is your most
precious treasure.
In the future, too, there may be
malevolent people at home
...and abroad, who will wish
to deprive you of this treasure. 
If some day you are compelled
to defend your independence...
... and your Republic, you must
not hesitate to weigh the
possibilities and circumstances...
But how? They were looking
at this a minute ago.
These possibilities and circumstances
may turn out to be
extremely unfavourable...
Look what's written
on this, Zühtü Bey.
Sir, even if we're the Rascals,
we know Atatürk's Address
to Turkish Youth memorized.
 I couldn't remove the straw, Zühtü.
I believed in you, Zühtü.
It's time to make love, Zühtü.
I believed in you, Zühtü.
Mahmut Hoca?
Yes, Zühtü Bey.
I think these Rascals
are making fun of me.
Why is that, sir?
Don't you hear the song
they're singing?
- I hear it.
- Isn't this making fun of me?
I suppose not.
This is a hit song nowadays.
Everybody is singing it, Zühtü Bey.
Sit down.
Well well,
you all can really sing, huh.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
However Zühtü Hoca was
offended by the song.
How come sir?
We all love Zühtü Hoca.
We love him very much, sir.
I love as much as you do.
Anyway, let's not talk
about this anymore.
I've just recieved a new
order from the Ministery.
All the high schools will pick an
eleMetary school and help it.
So what are we going to do, sir.
Those kids need; book,
notebooks, pencils, pretty much...
...anything school related.
Forget it Mahmut Hoca.
We shouldn't get those
kids into trouble.
Wouldn't to be a shame
to put them into this?
Let them enjoy
themselves in their farms.
Kids. You don't really
care anything. To be able to read...
...is something good,
something great.
You just don't appreciate
what you already have.
Those kids are eager
to be able read.
Only if you could realize how
valuable, anything you could...
...provide them, is.
Then maybe you would see
that this is the only thing
you can be proud of in the future.
Present of our little brothers
and sisters should especially
be education related.
Mine is toilet paper.
So that they can wipe
their appropriate places.
- What are you sending Saban?
- Me? I'm sending a map. Look.
So that they can
memorize all these curves.
And these.
- Help me a to pack
these Captain Mikis.
- What are you gonna
read at night?
- What are you sighing for?
If they've known about
this self-sacrifice of mine, they would
have made me mukhtar.
- Why is that?
- I'm sending them
my last pack of cigaterres.
I wonder which lucky
brat is gonna get this.
I'd love to see their teacher's
face when they open these packages.
I'd love to see Mahmut Hoca.
How suprised those
swains are going to be.
Watch your mouth!
You're the swain!
Are you talking to me?
Yes, you, you and you.
Everyone of you!
You miserable,
disgusting creatures!
Don't you have a even
piece of dignity?
What are these, huh?
How come you send those
naive people all this crap!
They want books.
They want Pencils.
Thay want a school.
Thay want to read.
Instead of giving them a hand,
your're teasing them,
and you're not even blushing.
Infact, you're the ones
to be teased and pitied.
You useless, parasites!
I'd have spited on your faces
only if I've known that you'd
be embarrased, but no you wouldn't.
Dear teachers and friends.
We wanted to spend this...
...last night by laugh and fun.
This traditional night has been...
...brought to you by
The Rascals again.
Now I present you,
Rascal Vocals and Seyyal Taner.
Now I introduce the big suprise of the night.
Rüchan Camhay!
And now the White Butterflies.
Thanks a lot for
preparing us this night...
to 6-A a.k.a. Tha Rascals.
Now it's time for
the Graduation Ceramony.
I'd be lovely if these friends
who's just made us laugh a lot,
...were also equally as
successful at their grades.
However, unfortunately,
only one of them has
managed to graduate.
217, Ahmet Sezer.
Come here Ahmet.
- Congratulations, son.
- I'd not make it
without you, sir. Thank you.
Dude, look the man,
he really graduated.
You should be proud, buddy.
This is the first time someone
from The Rascals ever graduated.
Yeah, that's great but
was so harsh last night.
- Wasn't he right?
- He was so damn right.
Of course he was right.
- You're the man Ahmet!
- Ahmet!
You're the man!
- Sir?
- Come on in Ahmet.
I wanted to say goodbye.
I'm so grateful for everything
you've done for me.
- Let me kiss your hand, sir.
- Thank you, Ahmet.
I don't know
how I can pay you back.
What paying back, son.
You've done it already.
The Diploma you have,
is the best thing you
can ever give me.
I expect you to continue
the rest of your education
life as successful as
you've been so far.
But I won't be studying
any further, sir.
- Why?
- I'll go back to my hometown
and teach there.
Those places are full of people
who are eager to study.
They need school and teachers too.
A Mahmut Hoca grows
an Ahmet and Ahmet has to
grow those who waits for him.
Mahmut Hoca, I think
this is a flag race.
Now I have the flag
and going to pass it
to the ones after me.
I'm so proud of you son.
You did the right thing.
I wish the others
would agree too.
Come on, enough already Ahmet.
OK, you're right
but you're leaving now.
At least let us
congratulate you.
Now you're one of us, buddy.
Are you going to leave
without a goodbye?
Come on give me your hand.
Excuse me but I won't
shake any of yours hand.
Because I don't believe neither
in your love or your friendship.
Actually, I've already forgotten
what you've done to me.
They were just silly jokes.
But I'll never be able to forgive
your attidutes that night.
You've killed the good side
of me for you...
and I don't even want to
see your faces anymore!
- My brothers and sisters,
today is the first day of school
and first lesson of yours.
I don't know if you know but,
also my first day as a teacher.
I'm as excited as you are.
And so happy.
I know what you've been
through to reach here.
God know how you get
your book and notebooks.
Our school isn't perfect
for education either.
But we're all here
together to study.
Today we start planting our seed to the ground.
And each one of you'll blossom.
You are going to be the hope
and tomorrows of this country.
I used have a teacher;
Mahmut Hoca.
He once said me; "I'm proud of you."
And I want to be
proud of all of you kids.
Mahmut Hoca!
- Welcome, sir.
- Thank you, Ahmet.
I can't believe my eyes.
You made me so happy, sir.
Look, your friends are also here.
They wanted to be here with you
on your first day as a teacher.
By the way, I have some
other news which I think
you'll be happy about.
They picked your school
as their "sibling school"...
...picked you as their
real brother.
If you allow them to,
they would like to
build a new school here.
I believe you wouldn't
turn their this wish down.
Come on guys.
