NETFLIX PRESENTS
Good morning, Sté.
I need to take some blood. Wake up.
It'll just take a second.
Hey, come on.
Stefano.
Sté.
Stefano!
Call the doctor.
-What's wrong?
-It's an emergency. Call the doctor!
There's no pulse. Give me a hand.
SEVEN DAYS EARLIER,
THURSDAY 15th OCTOBER 2009
You who live and reign for ever and ever.
Amen.
May the peace of the Lord
always be with you.
And with your spirit.
Offer each other a sign of peace.
Peace.
Left. Left. Cross.
Hey, Lu.
-You waiting for my sister?
-Yes, we're eating at my parents' house.
-Where are the kids?
-They're already there.
-Are you okay?
-Can't complain.
-Are we going to meet up soon?
-Sure.
-Bye.
-Bye, Sté.
Excuse me, can you...
Are you crazy?
I've got an idiot for a brother.
My brother's an idiot.
You should have seen your face!
When are you going to come over?
It's crazy,
I've got the busiest sister in Italy.
-We'll come soon.
-Yeah, right.
For now, this is for Valerio
and this is for Giulia.
Did you say hello
to Mr. Di Frascati from me?
-No, Dad.
-Why not?
Because I want people to stop seeing me
only as the son of Giovanni Cucchi
the surveyor.
I can't say hello
to every engineer I come across.
I left those signed papers
in your office.
Good.
Did I please you sorting out
this business in two seconds?
Yes, you pleased me.
I just hope you don't speak like that
when you're working.
You're obsessed with Italian.
You tell him.
You were a teacher for 30 years.
-Giovanni, I've given up on it.
-Right. Times change, eh?
Times change
but Italian grammar doesn't.
Know who the real smart-ass is?
The engineer.
Come rain or shine, at half past 12
he shuts up shop and goes for lunch.
You said you were staying here tonight.
I know, but I can't, I'm meeting a friend.
You can't pull that face
every time I say I'm sleeping at home.
Why did you even buy me my own place?
Look at me.
You don't need to worry. Just relax.
Trust me. It means a lot to me.
Remember it's Grandad's party on Sunday.
I remember.
-Bye, Ma.
-Bye.
-Don't you like eggplant parmesan?
-Yes, but...
-Then why are you laughing?
-I'm not.
But I've never heard of anyone
picking up a girl by cooking for her.
We all have our own style.
Did you invite her over or...
No, I see her in the bar
where I go for breakfast.
She works there with her father.
-So you took it to the bar?
-Of course. I don't know where she lives.
You're really something.
Give me a cigarette, mine are all gone.
Here.
But Laura appreciated the gesture.
Did she? Did she tell you?
She didn't say it,
but I saw when she smiled at me.
-What did you see?
-I saw... It was just a feeling.
-What kind of feeling?
-Of... Of...
-You're in tune?
-Yes.
-Pass me that lighter.
-It's called being in tune now, is it?
What's going on here?
Good evening.
We were just smoking a cigarette.
Get out of the car.
You too. Come on.
-Was it a cigarette or a joint?
-A cigarette. I'll show you.
-I can smell weed.
-They must have had some earlier.
Don't you guys smoke pot?
You'd better hand it over.
It'll be worse if we find it on you.
We don't have anything.
Give me your papers.
Come on, you too.
Come on.
This says you're a surveyor.
Your name's Stefano Cucchi.
Yes.
So, Cucchi, what were you handing
your friend just now?
Just now? Nothing.
-Did I give you anything?
-No, he gave me a cigarette.
-Is this your car?
-Yes.
Check it out.
-Are you searching us?
-Yes. Do you have any objections?
No objections.
I was just having a chat
with my friend in the car.
Listen, empty out your pockets
and put everything on the roof of the car.
Come on, get a move on.
You too, come on.
All of it.
Which one's your car?
That one.
-Legs apart.
-Yes, just a second.
-I told you, I don't have anything.
-We'll see about that.
What do we have here?
A chat with a friend, eh?
Who's this now?
Oh, it's you.
What's going on here?
These two have some drugs on them.
What are you doing here?
We knocked off half an hour ago.
But we'll give you a hand anyway.
It's turning into a cop party.
What did you say?
-Nothing.
-Turn around.
Being funny, are we?
I wouldn't if I were you.
If I was caught with a load of pot
and had five Carabinieri in front of me,
I'd stay nice and quiet.
What do you say?
-There's nothing in the car.
-Check his out too.
-You're the dealer, he's the customer?
-I'm a surveyor, not a dealer.
-Maybe that's your day job.
-I was just talking to my friend.
Shut up. You need to shut up.
APPIA CARABINIERI STATION, 11:40 p.m.
Trousers.
Underpants and socks.
Come on!
Squat.
Okay, you can get dressed, Cucchi.
-Are you a heroin user?
-I used to be.
I was in the CEIS rehab center in San
Patrignano, but I've been clean for ages.
Really? Then let's say
you have a long list of hobbies.
Pot, coke and pills.
Are you still going on about the pills?
I already told you.
It's Rivotril, for epilepsy.
I've been epileptic since I was 18.
We'll see what shows up in the drug test.
Who gave you the drugs?
I don't remember.
I bought them from a kid on the street.
I'd never seen him before.
Cucchi.
Look at me.
Do I look like an idiot to you?
No.
Then why are you treating me like one?
Tell me who sold you the drugs.
All these questions for two tiny pieces
of hash. I'm not a dealer.
I smoke a joint now and then, that's all.
Now and then, my ass!
You had 20 grams of hash on you,
in 12 packets, and two grams of cocaine.
So don't talk bullshit. You're a dealer.
Listen, Cucchi.
Tell me the name of your supplier
and where the deal took place, okay.
Will you call my lawyer, please?
We'll call him later. Where do you live?
I don't always sleep in the same place.
Sometimes at my mother's,
sometimes at a friend's. I move around.
-Where do your parents live?
-In Tor Pigna.
-I need the name of the street.
-Via Bartolino da Novara, 45.
Whatever.
We're doing a search
in Via Bartolino da Novara, 45.
You're going to wake them up in the middle
of the night? Isn't that cruel?
-What if you have more drugs at home?
-I don't have any, I told you so.
We'll give them a heart attack
for nothing.
The judge will decide if it's nothing.
Take this asshole away before I get angry.
Get up, Cucchi. Be a good boy.
-I don't have anything at home.
-You already told us. Stand up.
Stand up!
Send the other one in.
Can I talk, please?
Go on.
-Who is it?
-It's me, Ma. Open up.
Stefano, it's late.
You said you weren't coming back.
Open the door and I'll explain.
-Don't you have your keys?
-Will you open the door?
Fourth floor.
Will you tell me what's going on?
Be quiet, my husband...
We're Carabinieri, madam.
We need to do a search.
-Where's your son's room?
-Through there.
You sit there.
-What did he do?
-We found drugs on him.
Oh, my God. How come? Stefano quit.
-You did quit, didn't you?
-Yes, don't worry.
-I'm epileptic, right?
-Right.
-Show them the diagnosis.
-There's no need, madam.
Excuse me a second.
Giovanni!
-What is it?
-The Carabinieri are here.
There's nothing in there.
What are those two rooms down there?
The bathroom and our bedroom.
My company's office is on the ground
floor. I'll open it up if you want.
No, it's fine.
What happens now?
Give us some more information, please.
It's for the judge to decide,
but seeing as we haven't found any other
drugs, he might come home tomorrow.
-Can't he stay here?
-No, madam, your son's under arrest.
Has our lawyer been called?
Don't worry, we've dealt with that.
Don't worry, Ma.
Go and get the drug test.
We'll take him for his photos.
Happy now you've made them worried?
I told you there was nothing here.
-Because it's somewhere else.
-Because I'm not a dealer.
-You need to shut up. Get in.
-You're hurting me.
CASILINA CARABINIERI STATION, 2:15 a.m.
Wait.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Give me the keys to the photo room.
Go in.
Go on, get in there.
APPIA CARABINIERI STATION, 3:10 a.m.
Arrest report,
search report and drug test.
Sign here, then we'll put you to bed.
Read it and sign.
I'm not signing shit.
Send him to Tor Sapienza.
Driver's license.
ID card.
TOR SAPIENZA CARABINIERI STATION,
4:30 a.m.
Wallet.
Cigarettes.
Phone.
A ring.
-Did you write that down?
-Yes.
A ring...
Listen,
this is the chief officer's number.
Call him if you've got a problem.
-What problems should I have?
-None.
But I didn't make this arrest,
so I'm not responsible
for any problems that may arise,
Have I made myself clear?
Take off your belt.
Sure, I'll take it off. They broke it.
Who did?
Nothing, forget it.
Here.
And your jacket and shoelaces.
CELL IN TOR SAPIENZA CARABINIERI STATION
Guard!
Guard!
Guard!
-What's going on?
-This place is a shithole.
-I'm sick, I'm cold.
-What's wrong with you?
My head hurts, my back hurts.
I need to take my meds, I'm epileptic.
-I already told you. Stop fooling around.
-Calm down.
I'm calling an ambulance.
I'll get a doctor to look at you.
No, no, no...
I don't want a doctor to look at me.
Just bring me my Rivotril.
Calm down, Cucchi, I'll get a doctor.
Cucchi, the paramedics are here.
Send them home.
-What's his name?
-Cucchi.
-His first name?
-Stefano.
-Stefano, what's wrong with you?
-Nothing. I'm fine, thanks.
If they sent for us,
there's got to be a reason.
-Tell me what happened.
-Everything's fine.
Do you have a medical condition?
Do you take medication?
No. Goodbye.
You're making it hard for me.
At least let me take a look at you.
What do you want to see?
How handsome I am?
Are you playing games with me?
How can I help you if you're like this?
You don't have to help me.
I told you, everything's fine.
Listen, Sté, I'll tell you what.
Let's get out of here.
Come with me to the hospital.
Then we can have a chat in private.
Just you and me, eh?
Thanks for the offer.
But you'd be wasting your time.
Why are you hiding
under that blanket, then?
-What are you afraid of?
-Leave me alone. Let me sleep.
-Are you scared of someone?
-That's enough. Go away!
Sté, I'm really trying here.
If you change your mind, call us.
It's not a problem.
Let's go.
I usually noticed when he started again.
But he seemed fine this time.
FRIDAY
I thought so too.
He never missed a day at the office.
Tell him he has to go back to rehab.
We can't go on like this.
Right. It won't be easy
to convince him this time.
-Will you tell Ilaria?
-Yes.
-Hello, darling.
-Hello.
Dad, I'll be right with you. I want
to tell you about the flats in Via Fano.
They've decided to repair the roof.
We need to talk about it.
We'll talk when I get back.
-Aren't you going to the office?
-No. Bye, darling.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Here.
-Where's he going?
-To the court. Stefano's been arrested.
What's he done this time?
They found hash and cocaine on him.
-Any heroin?
-No, no heroin.
-Why didn't you tell me before?
-And wake you up?
He was arrested
in the middle of the night.
The Carabinieri searched the house
but they didn't find anything.
Why didn't they go to his place?
Maybe they'd already been there.
I don't know, we didn't talk about it.
Stefano was sitting in his room
in silence.
And to think
you even bought him his own place.
I told you it was too soon.
But you had to listen to the guy
at the rehab clinic.
Don't we know what Stefano's like?
At least when he lived here
we could keep an eye on him.
Stefano came over every day
and none of us suspected a thing.
Mom, I'm telling you now.
I won't let him make a fool of me anymore.
I'm not listening to his bullshit.
When Stefano gets out,
he needs to tell us the truth.
It's always the same truth, Ilaria.
It's been the same truth
for the last 15 years.
Cucchi.
Cucchi, wake up.
Cucchi, you have to go to court.
-Yes.
-Get up, it's morning.
-Okay.
-What happened to you?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
Look at the state you're in.
I fell down the stairs.
The stairs?
No, it was my friends.
Was it your friends
or did you fall down the stairs?
My friends made me fall down the stairs.
-Did you call an ambulance?
-Yes, my colleague did last night.
But he refused their help.
-Can you stand up?
-Yes.
-What's wrong?
-My head hurts.
And my back.
I need to take my epilepsy tablet.
-Where are your tablets?
-They confiscated them.
I'll take to you to hospital so you can
get what you need, and then to court.
No, I want to go straight to court.
As you wish.
Go on.
You can smoke one too, if you want.
I'd love one.
Thanks.
-Do you know him?
-Yes.
He's the one that arrested you, right?
Come on.
You stay here. Stand still.
Go in there.
HOLDING CELL AT THE COURT
In Albania I saw of a lot of guys
in the same state as you.
It's nothing.
Don't speak too soon.
Pain is treacherous.
It creeps up on you.
What's your name?
Stefano.
Mine's Levanaj.
Did the Carabinieri do that?
Yes.
The ones who brought you here?
No.
The ones from yesterday.
It's bad news,
making enemies of the Carabinieri.
You know when it starts
but you don't know when it will end.
Guard!
Guard!
I need my medication.
I need my Rivotril.
Damn you!
Can you hear me?
Don't call the guards "guards".
They won't even come
if you hang yourself.
You have to call them "assistants".
Imagine. This place is a shithole
and they're worried about this bullshit.
Assistant!
Assistant!
Where do you think you are, in a bar?
It's your turn.
Ouch.
Let's go.
I'm glad you came.
-What happened to you?
-I should have slept at your place.
We need to go in.
Who's this? I asked you to call my lawyer.
Why didn't you?
-Calm down.
-I won't.
-Stefano, I'm here to help you.
-I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want a court lawyer,
I want my own.
I'm here now
and the hearing is about to start.
Shall we try and work together?
You know what you're accused of?
-No.
-Possession and supply.
Supply? We've been friends for 20 years.
If he asks me for a spliff,
I'm not going to charge him.
Come with me,
you can tell me all about it.
THE LAW APPLIES TO ALL
Will one of the officers
come and give me the report?
Yesterday, as we were driving down
Via Lemonia, we spotted Stefano Cucchi.
We stopped him and found in his possession
20 grams of hashish divided into 12
pieces, and three small bags of cocaine.
We detained the buyer too,
who declared that he bought drugs
from Cucchi on a regular basis.
All right, you can go.
Let's proceed with the questioning.
First of all, give me your full name
and your date and place of birth.
Good morning.
I'm Stefano Cucchi,
born in Rome on October 1st 1978.
What did you say?
'78. Sorry, I'm finding it hard to speak.
-Do you work?
-I work with my father.
Are you married? Do you have children?
No, I'm single.
Any prior convictions?
Yes, not for drugs,
but I do have a record.
If you're released, where do you want
the trial documents to be sent?
To your lawyer or to another address?
To my new lawyer.
In fact I'd like to appoint him
as my lawyer of record.
From this moment on
you have the right not to answer,
but if you do answer,
what you say may be used against you.
Do you plead not guilty
or do you admit to the charges?
Well, I plead not guilty
as far as dealing is concerned,
and guilty of possessing drugs...
for personal use.
Do you have anything else to add?
No, nothing else.
-Do the parties have any questions?
-Yes.
Regarding your addiction,
are you attending any recovery facilities?
I'm registered with SERT at Tor Pignattara
but I buy my own methadone.
-You buy it?
-I buy it.
I don't go to SERT anymore
because I argued with some guys outside.
I can't go back there
so I buy it on the street.
I've also attended the CEIS
and Villa Maraini rehab clinics.
No further questions. Thank you.
-Public Prosecutor?
-No questions.
All rise.
The court validates
the arrest of the accused
and decrees
that he be remanded in custody.
The court orders that he will stand trial
as established by law.
The next hearing will take place
on November 13th, courtroom 18, 1:30 p.m.
-You'll make matters worse.
-Don't talk to me.
-Calm down.
-I'm sorry.
-I've messed up, haven't I, Dad?
-Don't worry.
Just promise me that as soon as
you get out, you'll go back to rehab.
Give me a hug, Dad.
Anything to declare?
No, I've nothing to declare.
You need to see a doctor.
I don't like the look of your face.
It's the exact same face I had
when I got here.
I don't care how you looked before.
You're in my charge now. Okay?
Yes.
Here's your Rivotril.
But now I'd like to know
how you got those bruises.
I fell down the stairs.
Very strange stairs.
They hurt the eyes, but not the nose.
Yes, they're strange stairs.
Whatever you say.
Recovery time of 25 days.
Here.
What happened to you?
I fell down the stairs.
When are we going to stop
this bullshit about the stairs?
When the stairs stop beating us up.
Come over here.
Why is he all bruised?
I don't know, but here's his certificate.
-Are the bruises and the swelling there?
-The whole lot.
The doctor even included his back pain.
-Does your back hurt?
-Yes, it does.
-Why are you standing? Go and sit down.
-Thanks.
Go on.
Give me a hand.
Where's Stefano?
-It didn't go well, Rita.
-What do you mean?
-Where's Stefano?
-In prison.
In prison? But the Carabinieri said...
It's the judge who decides,
not the Carabinieri.
So what happens now?
We have to wait for the trial.
It's on November 13th.
-In a month's time?
-Yes.
Stefano was covered in bruises.
-What do you mean?
-Bruises, Rita.
Red marks, mostly on his left side.
-Did they beat him up?
-I reckon so.
-Didn't Frattali say anything?
-He wasn't there. It was a court lawyer.
But the Carabinieri told us
he'd been called.
-Perhaps Stefano forgot his number.
-It's been on his phone for ten years.
They confiscate your phone
when you get arrested.
It's your right to phone your lawyer,
even children know that.
What can I say?
One thing's for sure.
Stefano was beaten up last night
by an inmate.
REGINA COELI PRISON
Face left.
Face right.
-Finished?
-Yes.
Come with me, young man.
Take your jacket off.
Have you had a head-on collision
with a train?
Jeez, you prison wardens
spotted it straightaway,
but the judge and the public prosecutor
didn't even notice.
Get undressed and bend over.
I can't, my back hurts.
Your back hurts?
Lift up your sweater.
Damn, you're skinny.
Do you eat once in a while?
Of course I eat.
But I'm careful what I eat, I'm a boxer.
You're a boxer?
Turn around.
You'd better forget about boxing,
you're not cut out for it.
You'll end up getting hurt.
Look at the state you're in.
Who said I got these bruises at the gym?
I didn't say that.
These bruises were a present
from the Carabinieri.
-That's a serious accusation.
-Just like the blows they gave me.
-How do I know that's the truth?
-Here's your truth.
So what?
Anyone could have given you those.
But it was them!
The Carabinieri beat me to a pulp.
I was on the floor and they kicked me.
They didn't even take my handcuffs off.
It's up to you
if you want to believe me or not.
Calm down and have a seat.
Sit down.
It's me.
I've got a kid here. Hold on...
What's your name?
Stefano Cucchi.
His name's Stefano Cucchi.
You don't have a doctor's certificate
by any chance?
Because he's covered in bruises.
You do? Perfect.
They might come looking for me otherwise.
Next.
The doctor at the court
says you fell down the stairs.
-That hurts, Doctor.
-Calm down.
Do you feel sick?
Yes, and I'm cold. I'm hurting all over.
Tell the officers.
He needs to leave here straightaway.
-Can I sit down?
-Go ahead.
It's not so painful like that, right?
Yes, and it's even better
if I stretch my legs out.
Stretch them out.
I really don't like the look of your back.
I'm sending you to the emergency room
because I can't do an X-ray here.
Okay.
Now we're on our own,
will you tell me what happened?
I'd rather not.
The doctors need to know
if you fell down the stairs
or if something else happened to you.
-Think about it at the hospital.
-I will.
You don't trust me?
You wouldn't either, Doctor.
FOUR HOURS LATER
Wake up.
The ambulance isn't going to wait for you.
FATEBENEFRATELLI HOSPITAL
Put your hands down by your sides.
Hold your breath.
Done.
Can you turn onto your side, Stefano?
Hands pointing upwards.
Keep still, hold your breath.
REGINA COELI PRISON CLINIC
It's late, come and get some sleep.
I can't.
I thought a night in jail
might do him good.
It might teach him a lesson.
But a whole month...
Yes, but there's no point
sitting here worrying.
When did you get here?
This evening.
What happened to your face?
Did the prison guards do that?
What's it to you? Are you a priest?
I'm only asking
because I've been there too.
It was the Carabinieri.
They even broke two of my vertebrae.
How many of them were there?
Two, in plain clothes.
One guy in uniform
was telling them to stop
but I guess they didn't listen to him.
You didn't tell the judge
they beat you up, did you?
Are you crazy? If I did, the Carabinieri
would screw me for ten years.
What did your lawyer say?
I didn't tell him either.
That was really stupid.
Your lawyer's the only person
who can get you out.
The more you help him, the easier it is.
-They've beaten me up. What can he do?
-Let him be the judge of that.
You've still got time.
Do it tomorrow morning.
Okay.
But I've got a more serious problem
right now.
I can't pee.
SATURDAY
I feel sick.
Take it easy with the potholes, please.
It really hurts.
FATEBENEFRATELLI HOSPITAL
It'll sting a little bit at first
but not for long.
Do I have to have this thing in?
If you can't urinate you need a catheter.
There are no other options.
I'll wait if you want to try again.
No, I've tried loads of times.
Are you happy?
You know who I have to thank for this?
-I'll be quick. Calm down.
-Calm down, my ass.
It's the cops' fault
that I'm in this state.
-What are you saying?
-I know what I'm saying.
-But now I'll only talk to my lawyer.
-Are you angry with us?
No, with those shitheads
who broke my back!
What should I do, go away or carry on?
Put the thing in, go on.
No, wait.
Go on.
We'll move him to the secure ward
at the Sandro Pertini.
-We've found a place.
-Okay.
There's no room here.
We're taking you somewhere else.
I'll get it.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
-Are you Giovanni Cucchi?
-Yes, that's right.
I need you to sign this form. Your son's
been taken to the Sandro Pertini hospital.
What's happened to him?
I don't know, they don't tell us anything.
They only inform us of the transfer.
This is a prison, not a hospital.
One: smoking's only allowed
between 1:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.
No smoking at night or in the morning.
Two: there are no dorms,
only single cells.
If you need anything,
press the emergency button.
Three: there's no yard time.
No walks.
This means you stay locked in your room
alone without causing trouble.
-Is that clear?
-Yes.
So do you agree to being admitted
or do you refuse?
I agree to everything.
As long as you let me speak to my lawyer.
-Yes?
-Good evening.
We'd like to know if Stefano Cucchi
is a patient here. We're his parents.
-Yes, he's here.
-Can we see him?
No, you can't.
This is a prison, not a clinic.
Can you tell us how he is?
We don't even know what happened to him.
Can we speak to the doctors?
You can speak to the doctors
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
from 12:00 to 14:00.
-So we have to wait until Monday?
-Those are the rules.
-Can't you tell us anything? Please.
-I'm not authorized.
-Can we leave him some clothes?
-No. Come back on Monday.
There's no smoking at this time of night.
I'll smoke this then I'll go to bed.
You need to put it out now.
Please. It's been a shitty day.
Turn around.
You need to look at me
when you're talking to me.
SUNDAY
Haven't you eaten anything?
Are you on hunger strike?
I need a painkiller.
Painkillers don't make you hungry.
I'd like to see you eat with this pain.
But you manage to smoke.
I'll go crazy if I quit smoking too.
You can't smoke in bed. You could
set the place on fire if you fall asleep.
Go fuck yourself.
Those pieces of shit!
Can you open this one?
MONDAY
Hello, Stefano. How are you feeling?
Bad. Who are you?
I'm the doctor on duty.
Will you tell me what happened?
It's written in my file.
I've read it,
but I'd like to hear it from you.
It says you have two
fractured vertebrae. Did you know that?
What do you think?
It's very serious.
You have to keep as still as possible.
We don't know if they're stable.
Thanks. I'm not going anywhere.
It was caused by a fall, right?
Right.
-Are you in pain?
-I'm in pain.
-Trouble breathing?
-No.
-Chest pains?
-No.
-Headache?
-No.
Why are you lying face down?
Because it doesn't hurt as much.
-Let me have a look at your eyes.
-Leave me alone!
Stefano, I need to evaluate the situation.
I can't walk and I can't pee,
that's the situation. Go away.
Have new X-rays done and make a note
that the patient refuses to be examined.
Giovanni, who says that Stefano
got those bruises from an inmate?
-Are you sure?
-No, I'm not sure at all.
Then why did you say it?
Because it seemed
the most likely explanation.
Did he spend the first night in prison?
-No, at the Carabinieri station.
-So they did it.
It's just as well, in that case.
If he had trouble with a Carabiniere,
he won't see him at the hospital.
You saw the Carabinieri at the trial.
You should have said something.
-I don't like your tone of voice.
-Forget about that. Answer me.
I'm not going to accuse them
while Stefano is still in their custody.
-Do you think that's sensible?
-So we just keep quiet, then?
-Stefano didn't mention it either.
-He probably thought it was for the best.
It's your word against an officer
of the law. It's not that simple.
We've always had faith in the law.
And we trusted Stefano when he said
he was clean. Look where that got us.
Should I have raised my hand and said,
"Your Honor, look at Stefano's bruises.
Can you ask if the Carabinieri did it?"
Rita, I'm tired. I'm over 60.
I'm no longer the man who went out
looking for my drugged-up son at 3 a.m.
Stefano's 31, he's a man now.
We can help him, we can advise him.
But he has to get himself
out of trouble now.
So... unfortunately we can't do anything
without the judge's authorization.
-You'd better come back tomorrow.
-What authorization?
On Saturday they told us
we could go in today.
They said to come back Monday
during visiting hours.
I don't know what to say.
We have to follow the rules.
Your son's a prisoner.
He's not a regular patient.
Can you hear me?
Of course I can hear you. Who are you?
I'm Marco.
When did you get here?
This afternoon.
They told me you were getting X-rays done.
Wow. I'd lost all hope.
I've been talking to myself
for the last three days.
I came here from Regina Coeli.
What about you?
From Rebibbia.
Once you've been sentenced
you go to Rebibbia.
What did you do, Marco?
I can tell you're a new boy.
No one here says, "What did you do?"
They say, "What are you accused of?"
We're all innocent in here.
I've been accused of being a drug dealer.
I'm doing time for armed robbery.
How come you're in here?
It's a long story.
TUESDAY
Easy does it. Nice and easy.
There we go.
Easy...
We're almost done. Almost done.
There we are.
Hold on.
Okay.
Are you sure
you don't want to change, Sté?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
You've had these clothes on
for three days. Let's take them off.
No, tell...
Tell the doctor I need a painkiller.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
-Okay. Do you want to stay like that?
-Yes.
I'll just put this under your head.
Lift up.
There you are.
-We'd like to speak to the doctors.
-Do you have authorization from the court?
You're the ones who should have
the authorization from the court.
No, you have to apply for it at the court.
-Are you making fun of us?
-Mind what you say.
Those are the rules, I don't make them up.
You're telling us one rule every day.
We've been here three times for nothing.
How do we know how these things work?
Yesterday your colleague said
the authorization would be here today.
He can tell you what he wants,
but this is how things stand. Goodbye.
Wait.
What's with the half-empty bottles?
I need to see how much you're drinking.
I'll leave you a full one.
Forget about that. You worry about looking
after me, I'll worry about drinking.
We're here to help you, not to bother you.
You weren't very nice
to the doctor yesterday.
Just leave. Don't make me talk.
You see what you're like?
You're always so defensive.
-If you want to say something, go ahead.
-Can we stop this charade?
-What charade?
-Can't you tell I've been beaten up?
Haven't any of you noticed?
You make me sick.
While we're at it,
I'll tell you who beat me up.
It was the Carabinieri.
I'll call the assistant
and you can tell him.
He minds his own business,
like everyone else in here.
-Well, let's see.
-Don't bother. I'm not telling him.
No, if it's true, you have to tell him.
Let's say it's not true, then.
Let's say I made it all up.
Do what you want, just let me sleep.
Is that the lawyer?
Good morning, this is Ilaria Cucchi.
I'm Stefano's sister. Good morning.
I'm calling you because my brother was
taken to the Pertini hospital on Saturday
and we haven't had any news yet.
The first day they said
that it's closed on Sundays,
then that we need authorization from the
jail, then authorization from the judge.
Is this a joke?
No, look... I'm sorry.
We've followed all the rules
without complaining,
but there's a limit
to our patience, right?
Yes.
All right.
Then tell me what we need to do
to have some news.
Look, to be honest, this seems ridiculous.
Okay, from now on
you speak only to me. Thank you.
Stefano's going to have to tell me
why he kept this guy.
Here, Mom.
Let's go.
-Shall we speak later?
-Yes.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Marco?
I'm here.
Ever since I've been here
I've been having the same nightmare.
Tell me about it.
I dream that...
the Carabinieri find out
I have an apartment,
they search it and find all the stuff.
What's the problem?
Send someone to get rid of it.
Who would I send?
My father and my sister?
A friend you trust.
Get him to come and visit you
and explain the situation.
You make it sound easy.
Sté, listen to me. Don't hang about.
If anyone knows about the stuff,
they'll break in and steal it all.
You're doing a lot worse.
Your blood test results aren't good.
Your nitrogen levels are at 180.
That means you're dehydrated
and at risk of renal failure.
I know you don't want this,
but we need to put you on a drip.
WEDNESDAY
I don't want a drip, I told you.
Stefano, you let us take blood samples.
What's the difference?
Taking's one thing, injecting's another.
Okay, from now on the patient
will drink with a nurse present.
All right, Doctor.
One more thing, Stefano.
I need to do a scan of your abdomen.
I want to exclude any damage to your liver
caused by your fall.
Okay, you can do that.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just let me see my lawyer.
And Francesco. He's a volunteer
from the CEIS rehab center.
There are volunteers here,
but not from CEIS.
I can send one in,
I just saw her in the corridor.
Send her in.
-Go and find her.
-Okay.
Now write down
that I refuse to have a scan and a drip
because I want to see my lawyer,
not because I don't want treatment.
All right?
Sign.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Next time you could ask the nurses.
Don't you get along with the staff?
With some of them...
but not others.
-Can I ask you a favor?
-Of course.
This is my brother-in-law's number.
Can you ask him
to come and see me? It's important.
All right, I'll call him
as soon as I leave.
-What's his name?
-Luca.
Okay.
One other thing.
Can I have a Bible?
Are you a believer?
I'm a hoper.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-How are things?
-Fine.
What a day.
A volunteer from Stefano's hospital
called half an hour ago.
-What did she say?
-She didn't say very much.
She said he's worn out.
He's tired.
But he spoke to her.
That's something, right?
-That's good news, right?
-Yes.
Listen...
it seems Stefano wants to see you.
Me?
To be honest,
I don't know why he chose you.
He could have asked for my parents, or me.
Perhaps he knew you'd yell at him, Ila.
No, come on.
You think he doesn't know you?
I'm not saying you're wrong.
But it's understandable.
No, come on.
I promise you, when they let me see him
I won't yell at him.
Maybe when he gets home,
but not in there.
But I hope that's the reason why,
and not something else.
Like he's mad at us.
About what?
He doesn't know all the trouble we've had
trying to see him.
He sees that nobody's visiting
and must think we're angry with him.
I'd think that, after a week.
Did you call?
Do you feel ill?
Can I have some chocolate?
Chocolate?
Where am I going to find chocolate?
We've got some jam.
Or shall I bring you some fruit juice?
No, I wanted some chocolate.
It doesn't matter.
Can I go?
Yes.
Okay.
I made fools of them.
You think I don't know that?
I told them a load of bullshit.
But there's one thing I want to tell them.
Having a son like me...
They really didn't deserve it.
And then there's this...
this feeling I have...
I just can't explain it.
Marco?
Hey.
Have you fallen asleep?
THURSDAY
Good morning, Stefano.
I need to take some blood.
Wake up, Sté.
It'll just take a second.
Sté.
Call the doctor.
-What's wrong?
-It's an emergency. Call the doctor!
There's no pulse. Give me a hand.
Stefano!
Stefano!
Don't fool around, Sté!
-What's happened?
-He's not breathing, Doctor.
Let me try.
Good morning.
-Mrs. Cucchi?
-Yes.
I need you to come to the station
to sign a form.
Has something happened?
No, we need to ask you some questions,
then we'll bring you home.
I've got my little granddaughter here.
How can I come with you?
-I'll find another solution, okay?
-Yes.
Excuse me a moment.
Can you bring the form upstairs, please?
Come with Grandma, Giulia.
What questions do you need to ask me?
We need to clarify a few things.
It won't take long.
-May I?
-Come in.
-Take the little girl.
-Why?
It'll be easier for you to write.
-No, I can hold her.
-Don't worry, he's got a little girl too.
Hi.
Grandma.
Your son Stefano
was born on October 1st 1978?
-Yes.
-Okay.
-In Rome?
-Yes.
Single? No wife or children, right?
Single.
Madam, unfortunately I have some bad news.
Your son Stefano is dead.
You need to sign the authorization
for the autopsy.
Is that the lawyer?
This is Ilaria Cucchi.
Do you remember my brother?
He's dead.
He's dead and we only found out
from the autopsy notification.
Can you imagine?
Are those the rules?
What do I need to do?
Yes.
I've got the report here.
"Following the death,
for reasons yet to be determined,
of Stefano Cucchi,
it is necessary to carry out
with the utmost urgency
indispensable tests,
and in particular an external examination
and possibly an autopsy
on the corpse of Stefano Cucchi,
as well as any necessary
chemical analyses of bodily fluids..."
Dad's here.
MUNICIPAL MORGUE
Excuse me, who do we need to speak to?
Who is the doctor on duty?
I am. Good morning.
We want to see my brother,
Stefano Cucchi. He's just been brought in.
That won't be possible, I'm sorry.
We couldn't see him when he was alive
and you won't let us see him
now he's dead?
-It's just not allowed.
-Not allowed? It's our right.
It's no use getting angry with me.
We need authorization from the prosecutor.
-Well, get it, then.
-You can't just get it like that.
What do mean?
Call the prosecutor and ask for it.
We're not leaving here
until you let us see him, all right?
Okay. Have a seat, I'll make a phone call
and see what we can do.
We're ready.
Take them through.
Stefano!
My son!
What did they do to you?
Stefano Cucchi was the 148th person
to die in prison in 2009.
The total number of deaths that year
was 172.
Doctors and forensic experts
have not yet found
a scientific explanation they can
all agree on for Stefano Cucchi's death.
In their son's apartment,
Stefano Cucchi's parents found
over a kilo of hashish
and 130 grams of cocaine,
which they reported
to the police straightaway.
In the first trial for Stefano Cucchi's
death, all the defendants were acquitted.
After a further investigation
by the public prosecutor,
on July 10th 2017
the judge for preliminary hearings
indicted three Carabinieri
for involuntary manslaughter
and two others for slander
and forgery of public documents.
After Stefano's death, Ilaria Cucchi,
his parents Rita and Giovanni
and lawyer Fabio Anselmo
embarked on a fight for the truth.
In 2007 they set up a non-profit
organization in Stefano's name
to defend
citizens' human and civil rights.
Good morning.
I'm Stefano Cucchi,
born in Rome on October 1st 1978.
Yes, '78.
Sorry, I'm finding it hard to speak.
-Do you work?
-I work with my father.
Are you married? Do you have children?
No, I'm single.
Any prior convictions?
Yes, not for drugs,
but I do have a record.
If you're released, where do you want
the trial documents to be sent?
To your lawyer or to another address?
To my new lawyer.
-To your lawyer.
-My new...
In fact I'd like to appoint him
as my elected lawyer.
-Of record.
-Please... Yes, sorry.
So to the lawyer here present,
who I nominate as your lawyer of record.
Do you plead not guilty
or do you admit to the charges?
I plead not guilty
as far as dealing is concerned,
but guilty of possessing drugs...
for personal use.
