I want to thank you for keeping the owls
away from my cat food.
Did you sleep ok?
Sort of.
I...
God, Jean, I don't know what happened.
It's like a...
redness where something comes over me.
And I...
But I feel like you back me up
in a corner and I...
You do that.
And I hate it when I'm like that.
I'm sorry.
Can you forgive me?
What? What?
Fuck!
You promised.
If it happened again...
You promised.
Ok, this is last week and up to yesterday.
All right?
I stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- Judy, I can't.
No. I don't want to see you coming
around anymore looking like this.
You take care. Take care of that girl.
We have an agreement with Kansas.
If you can stay here for a week...
I can find you a place in Wichita.
- No.
Every man knows where this shelter is.
- Do you have someone you can stay with?
Do you understand how worried I am.
- Maybe they went shopping or something.
If someone in this goddamn place
would just give me the truth.
Then we could find Jean pretty damn quick.
Tiburon, Kansas. Do you want to go there?
- Maybe. We can go anywhere we want.
How about... Loving, New Mexico?
I like that.
- Me too.
Topeka.
Oh, my gosh. There's a Butt, Montana.
It's pronounced "Butte".
Mom?
- Oh, no.
Hey!
She's not going anywhere. There's a rod
sticking through the block.
I'm heading to Sioux Falls.
Yeah.
Now just take what you need.
So one inch is 83 miles.
One... two... three... four... five...
six... seven... eight... nine... ten.
Aloha, Oregon.
It's only 10 inches away...
So that's 830 miles.
And we've already gone 300 miles.
- We're going to Wyoming.
What's in Wyoming?
It's where your grandfather lives.
I have a grandfather?
Not much of one.
When were you going to tell me?
It smells like rain.
- It's not going to rain today.
You haven't been right
about the weather since 1972.
I know what rain looks like.
You got something on your mind today?
The goddamn bear's back.
What do you think you're going to do?
What I should have done a year ago.
It was bigger than a car.
- Did anyone notice if he had cubs? No?
Here it comes.
It's under control, Einar.
- Get out of the way and it will be.
Let's let the Fish and Game
take care of this.
This isn't some pet dog they're after.
- I think they can tell the difference.
This says what a college education
can get you.
Mom.
Welcome to Wyoming.
Come on, this is us.
So is my grandpa nice?
Why didn't you tell me about him?
Einar.
I don't want you here.
Well, at least we agree on something.
I don't want to be here either.
We need a place to stay
for about a month or so.
Looks like you need
every part of your head examined.
Is this yours?
She's yours, too.
You're telling me I have a grandchild
I don't know about?
I'm telling you
I was pregnant at Griffin's funeral.
Where you been till now?
We've been on the road for two days.
We lived in Iowa.
Now this suddenly seems like home?
What's your name?
- My name's Griff.
Griff Gilkyson.
That's an unusual name for a girl.
Einar, please.
Just until I can earn enough
to get us out of here.
There's a room in the basement.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
I'm going to go into town and look
for a job. You'll be all right here?
I want just... be good.
I love you.
I used the bathroom.
- I heard you.
Are you hungry?
- Not yet.
Is there a McDonald's in town?
- You have 5 dollars?
No.
Then I don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.
How was your night?
All right, I guess.
- Left or right?
Let's do the right.
The left could use a rest.
Is the pain bad all the time now?
- It gets my full attention.
Yeah.
What happened with my bear?
- He's his own damn bear.
You're telling me he's still alive?
- He's in that zoo Angie built.
I was dreaming about these a last night.
- Did you get wet?
I walked right in.
It felt like falling in love.
It smelled like a woman.
Tasted like one, too.
- Mitch, your memory's not that good.
I see Jean kept her looks.
She brought her daughter with her.
- She says it's Griffin's.
A granddaughter.
That's a nice thing for a man to have.
I might go into town for breakfast.
All right.
You are taking the girl with you?
- Anything else you need?
Yeah, look in on the bear.
What?
Check on the bear.
- Why in the hell would I do that?
Because I asked you to.
Are those my dad's things?
Yeah, they are.
- Where does he live now?
He's dead.
Didn't your mother tell you that?
Yeah, but she said you were dead, too.
Are you confused about why they call
a room with a table a dining room?
No, Sir.
Since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich...
I'd like you to make another on eat 11:30.
Can you do that? - Yes, Sir.
Then take it out to that man that lives
in the little house. And a glass of milk.
Yes, Sir.
Got to go check on the bear.
Oh, goddamn it.
Oh, goddamn it.
Oh, goddamn it.
Nice wheels, Einar.
Where'd you get the rig?
Nancy said Will had this shipped up
from that village where Ernie died.
Maybe it was the bike that killed Ernie.
What killed Ernie
was a lifetime of Nancy's cooking.
Your pickup broke down again?
- Oh, hell, no. The pickup's fine.
I'm just out here training for a marathon.
- I like the flag.
Without an orange flag like that,
you might look ridiculous.
Hello, Ken, Kathy.
- Einar.
All I got is bills.
Morning, Einar.
- Good morning, Nina.
They're still sending junk mail to my boy.
Maybe the dead are flattered to get
a letter. - I'll let you know
when I'm gone. Maybe I'll send
you a postcard from the other side.
Hey, how's Mitch doing?
Mitch was dreaming about these a.
- Oh, yeah? I used to live by the ocean.
Up in Oregon. For about a year.
Yeah, too much rain if you ask me,
but I like the sound it makes.
- What's up?
If you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your sink and turn on the tap.
Well, if I ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.
I wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.
No, it's easy if you don't stop drinking
all night. - You'd know.
How do you want your eggs?
- Scrambled.
Hey there, boys.
What can I get you this morning?
You can get down on this table
and I can see if I can stay on you.
As soon as I get one arm free
I'm going to kick your ass.
Oh, yeah? Now look what you went and did.
Good morning, fell as. I'm going to be
your new waiter. Do you want some coffee?
Why don't you screw right off, bastard?
- What?
Son...
I don't want to work myself short
of breath. It can be over all at once.
Because that's how goddamn fast
your life can change. You believe me?
Sorry for the mess.
Hi.
Hi.
My name's Griff.
- My name is Mitch.
Is that for me?
Thank you.
Yeah, I know. I almost threw up
the first time I looked at it.
You feeling a little queasy?
- I'm fine.
I got queasy the first time I saw a man
eat a snail. You ever eat a snail?
No.
Me neither. This looks good.
What happened to you?
- I was mauled by a bear.
I saw a bear in a cage yesterday.
- Yeah, that was my bear.
About a year ago, he was eating one
of your grandfather's calves.
Well, we sort of interrupted his dinner.
You know. He thought we were going
to take it away from him.
You know bears, they don't like to share.
Did the bear bite Einar?
- No, I was closer.
I didn't know anyone ates nails.
- Yeah, sure.
In those fancy restaurants up in Cheyenne,
they eat them all the time.
Like there's nothing to it.
Once I saw this kid eat a moth.
You could hear the crunch.
Oh, no.
Einar.
Hey, Angie.
- I didn't expect to see you here.
I guess at my age, it's good to be seen
just about anywhere.
Fish and Game said he'd settle down
in a few days. Of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.
Nobody wanted to pay 5 dollars
for the lion I used to keep in here.
How's Mitch?
- He's dreaming about the sea.
I always wanted a boat. My dad used
to take us out. It was so great.
What happened to the lion?
He died.
Lucky lion.
Hello, Griffin.
Well, it says here, you might have
already won 15 million dollars.
I probably ought to send it in for you.
It's probably the same damn odds
as losing my kid early.
I got that done.
You should know your wife came back.
You could have steered her someplace else.
Just because you're dead
doesn't mean you can't be useful.
I'll see you tomorrow, boy.
The kid sure looks a whole lot like you.
Top to bottom.
Mom!
Hey.
I missed you. - I got a job.
Really?
I'm starting tomorrow. How was your day?
Not so great?
I'm tired.
I think half the people we served
came in just to take a good look at you.
Here you go.
What's this?
- Your half of the tips.
I thought you said you were used
to being on your feet.
I'm not used to telling everyone
where I've been the last 10 years.
Well, tell them you went crazy.
Tell them you've been locked up.
That's what I've been telling them.
- It looks like we did good today.
I guess I've got you to thank for that.
Maybe I'll have some music on Saturday.
Of course, then again, you'd have to dance
with Billy and Wayne.
Oh, that would be a sight.
Can I help you?
I'm Einar Gilkyson's daughter-in-law.
- Yes, I know.
Did you want to come in?
- Thank you.
Any calls?
- Nothing.
Homemade lunch, you know.
You got something there
you want me to see?
It's a police report.
But I didn't press charges.
A shelter worker thought I ought to check
in with authorities when I got settled.
He was my boyfriend.
But...
The report's not for this time.
It's for another time.
I'll make a copy.
What are their names?
Who?
- Your cats.
They don't have any names.
How do you tell them apart?
- I don't tell them apart.
Oh, goddamn, cheap ass, Mickey Mouse,
foreign goddamn part.
Oscar and Charlie. Hi, Charlie.
Is that the water pump belt?
Why don't you use that out of the tractor?
- Yeah, use the one out of the tractor.
Are you mumbling over there or something?
The tractor belt's twice this size.
- Really?
Yeah.
Do we have spare belts in the barn?
- I got a great idea.
Why don't you go back in the house?
- Well.
Damn. I was...
just trying to be helpful. If you don't
want my help, I'll just shut up.
It don't look like you know
what you're doing. - Just shut up.
Shut up. You don't know what I'm doing.
You don't know anything about the truck.
Who you talking to? - Philosopher!
You second generation immigrant.
How about I come over there
and hang my bad foot in your ass?
Thanks. - Anytime.
See you tomorrow.
Hey, kiddo. - Hey.
How was it?
All right.
- See you, Einar.
I got some groceries for dinner.
Ok.
You want to take these inside?
- Sure.
You got it?
Hey, Mitch.
- Hey there.
What happened here?
Why'd you stop running cows?
When Griffin died, I ran out of help.
I got older, Mitch got mauled...
I sold the stock to stay on the place.
Dinner will be ready in an hour.
Come here, Sara.
You finished?
- Yeah.
Tell your kid to comedown
out of that tree.
Oh, Jesus.
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
Well, that's just fine, then.
- I'll buy you a new one.
Oh? It's just that easy?
Maybe I liked that plate.
Maybe that was my favorite goddamn plate.
It's just a plate.
- Not everything can be replaced.
Comedown out of that tree!
You want this on the table?
- No, over here.
I'm so glad you're back, Jean.
What happened to Nellie?
Nellie left.
About a year after we buried Griffin.
Einar just never got a handle on it.
And then when he hardly
even noticed Nellie anymore...
She found another man who would.
I think they're living in Colorado.
Do you think he blames me
for losing his wife, too?
I imagine he does.
I don't want to stay here.
What's wrong with him?
- Well, it's not you.
He just never got over it.
He really loved your dad.
You should know that.
Did you?
- Of course.
You do have a plan though, right? I mean,
we don't have to stay here forever.
Sure I do. As soon as I earn enough money,
I'm gonna get us right out of here.
You know what? What do you think about...
"Butt", Montana?
Come on. Let's play.
You don't know how to read anymore.
Where'd the bottle come from?
The granary. It's been there for awhile.
Sometimes I just like to look at it.
Fifteen, two. You gonna open it?
I'm not sure yet. Twenty-five.
- Thirty-one, two.
Go.
Did you check on the bear?
- Eight. Yeah, you asked me to.
There's a pair for two.
I want you to feed him.
What?
- I want you to feed the bear.
I don't trust Angie.
- Feed the bear. Please feed the bear.
"Bear, would you like a pair of shoes?
A little steak? Chicken?"
Einar.
- What?
Is her being here going to ruin you?
The woman killed my son.
- No. Come on. It was a car accident.
An accident is nobody's fault.
- No, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.
- Is that so?
Mitch, I don't give a goddamn
what they call it. My son's dead.
Your granddaughter's not.
And neither are you.
Have you thought about
how she's going to remember you?
Come to think of it, I don't feel
like playing cards tonight.
And put that bottle someplace
where I don't have to look at it.
Do you know anything about pickup trucks?
Ah, shit. Hand me that half inch
socket wrench, would you?
No, no, no, the shiny one on the top.
Yeah.
You want to see what I'm doing?
That's it.
Ok, you see these screws here?
This one I'm tightening,
this holds this thing up
which holds the pan up.
If this comes loose while you're driving,
you'll be sitting on the road.
How come you and Einar don't get along?
You're practically his daughter.
What I am is his dead son's wife.
He's always been really good to me.
He's the first friend I met here.
I am not in the mood for their crap.
I'll take them.
The special today is the enchilada plate.
- Thank you.
They're good enchiladas,
served by good people.
I'm a good person.
I'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit from men.
I couldn't take a pinch of crap
from two little cheese dicks like you.
Ok, crank it.
Again.
Again.
Ok, take your foot off the gas.
Take your foot off the gas!
Is that for lunch?
- It's for a bear.
Who the hell knows what a bear eats?
Did I ask you to do that?
- Don't bears like honey?
Winnie the Pooh does.
I thought you were sick.
I haven't seen you for a few days.
This is a two restaurant town. I try
to spread the county's money around.
I'll have the meatloaf. Can you ask her
if I can have onion rings? - Onion.
Sure, I'll ask.
Could you give me a ride home after work?
Sure.
He looks like he's dancing.
- Maybe he's just happy to see a girl
with a sack of meat. Get you some there.
Why don't you toss this?
He likes the honey.
- I think he does.
Is that really the bear
that hurt Mr. Bradley?
He's the one.
I don't wanna go right home. Not just yet.
- You don't?
Can't we just drive a little?
Here's the thing. I'm gonna be here
about three more weeks. I'm afraid
I'm not gonna get through it.
Three weeks?
I don't wanna be in love, Crane.
Don't start without me.
What's that?
A flower.
- It's not a flower, it's a weed.
It's pretty, though.
Don't you think it's pretty?
Yeah, I think it's lovely.
You want to wait for your mother?
- Just a little bit.
Ok.
I had a music teacher who was a lesbian.
You guys are gay, right?
After almost 40 years of working together,
one of us would have noticed.
Well, Einar...
I always thought you had lovely hands.
- You did? You never told me that.
I mean, it's cool. Everybody needs love.
- You got that part right, little girl.
God, what's next?
Hey.
Hey, yourself. How are you doing?
- Good. How are you?
Good. There's somebody I want you to meet.
Griff, this is Sheriff Curtis.
- It's nice to meet you, Griff.
Are you hungry?
- There isn't enough.
I got to swing back through town anyway.
So... I'll see you?
Thanks for the ride home.
- Take care of yourself, Crane.
I don't like him. - I didn't ask you.
I don't remember you ever asking me.
I don't need your permission.
Do you know how to treat a guest?
- It's just some guy my mom brought home.
I expect you to be pleasant
to whoever comes to my door.
Yes, Sir.
Unless some guy will sell his angle
on God. There's no excuse for that.
Well, all right then. Let's give a try
at these good looking sandwiches.
There you go. Hold it right about here,
just below the Honda.
Don't worry about his foot. It's not going
to go anywhere. - Look at that calf run.
He's off and gone.
Oh! That's just a little bit low.
I got it!
Look at that.
- Oh, yeah. Go on. Try it again.
Here.
You got any more improvements you want
to make around here? - I just thought
I'd straighten some of this mess.
Maybe Mitch wants to work on something.
Did you ask him about it?
- Well, of course she did.
Now that we've got interesting company
around here, I feel inspired.
Excuse me. I got to go to work.
Do you want to know what I dreamed
last night? - What?
I dreamed you weren't
such a miserable son of a bitch.
That's not dreaming.
That's wishful thinking.
Did you hear anything unusual last night?
Yeah, somebody poking around
down by the river.
I found some footprints.
And this.
I sure do miss smoking.
So do I.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
- We're going to Angie's zoo.
What kind of pies you got today, Nina?
- Hey.
I've got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan. Good for your teeth.
Chocolate pecan, please, with ice cream.
Two chocolate pecans, one with ice-cream.
- Coming right up.
I'll be right back.
Crane.
Einar.
She captured your interest?
You thought about the girl? They're a set.
- Can I get you anything else, Crane?
No, just the check.
- Ok.
How's the law stand on shooting somebody
on your property?
Well, if you didn't want to go to prison,
it would be better to be in the house.
I thought it.
- You've got a problem?
I'll let you know.
You want to hand me that rasp?
No, no, those are pliers.
The rasp is next to it.
This?
- That's it. Yeah.
Are there really cowgirls?
Haven't you ever ridden a horse before?
- No.
There weren't any horses
around Gary's apartment.
He was my mom's boyfriend.
We lived with him for two years.
My mom had another boyfriend before Gary.
His name was Hank.
He didn't have any horses either.
Hank didn't hit my mom like Gary did.
He was just mean with his words. Like you.
I see where not learning to ride a horse,
is a disadvantage for a cowgirl.
You want to try? - Yeah.
Here. Grab that blanket.
What's that?
You want to have a look?
Good afternoon, boy.
Your father was sure first rate.
I miss him.
I wish I missed him.
You would if you'd known him.
- Stay here.
Your mama's boyfriend in Iowa,
did he smoke?
Yeah, a lot.
Did he hit you?
Mostly my mom. Jimmy.
Jimmy. No. No.
My parents scraped and saved to get us out
of El Paso, to get a quiet place.
Far away from everything.
They put an interstate right through it.
- Oh, this would have killed them.
I remember your parents.
- You do?
Yeah, they were good people.
- What a mess. Did you know Griffin?
Yeah.
He was two years behind me in high school.
So you know how he died?
Yeah, it was...
up in Calgary, at the Stampede.
A car accident.
I guess everybody in town knows that.
That was a long time ago.
I was driving, you know.
I guess everybody in town knows that, too.
Hello.
- Hello.
I'm not so sure
I'm happy to see you in here.
How about a club soda, Eileen?
- I can do that for you.
I hear you have a granddaughter.
- By God I do.
How old is she?
- She's still shiny.
She still expects
everything's going to turn out all right.
That's a good age.
You know those guys?
The one in the hat is Jeff Spears' boy,
Josh. - And the other guy?
Some dude from the Midwest.
Einar.
Her ex-boyfriend's in town.
- Yeah, I know.
He's staying down at the Sage Creek Motel.
- Why in the hell didn't you arrest him?
I can't do anything except keep an eye
on him unless he bothers her.
Does she know he's here?
- No, I haven't told her yet.
Look, if he'd been out at your place,
I could make that enough.
Let me know if he bothers you.
- He doesn't bother me one little bit.
Bad news.
Bad news. That's fifteen, two.
Fifteen, four. That's two runs of three...
And a pair, which puts me out.
I haven't had a decent hand all night.
- Don't grouse. You still have something.
I'm not grousing.
You want some help getting in bed?
- No, I'll manage that.
I always thought
this was one of your best.
Well, thank you.
You ever wish you'd lived another life
rather than working the place with me?
No.
I was always happy
that I found work that suited me.
Since I was a kid...
All I ever wanted to be was a cowboy.
How about now?
- Now, too.
You mind if I leave Griff here with you
until her mother comes home?
There's an errand in town I'd like to run.
- It'd be all right with me.
Hey.
Be careful with that errand.
Yeah?
Take it easy, buddy. What do you want?
I'm helping you pack.
You don't know how much I love her.
- Your love was written all over her face
when she got here.
There's nothing more useless than someone
who runs after a woman like you did.
She wanted me to find her. If she didn't,
she wouldn't have come back here.
Pull over. Here.
Keep going. If I see you back here again,
I'll kill you.
You've seen too many westerns, old man.
- That doesn't exactly work in your favor.
You need a ride?
- A ride would be fine.
Did that man threaten you?
- Yeah, he did.
Jean Gilkyson doesn't want you here.
- You don't know her like I do.
No, you're right, I don't.
I'll make this simple for you.
I don't want you here.
Now get going.
Is this something we're going
to have to talk a lot about?
No, Einar.
We never have to talk about this again.
Jean!
Jean!
What?
- Get dressed. I want to talk to you.
What is it?
I just had a chat with your ex-boyfriend.
You ought to know he was in town.
- You mean Gary's here?
He was.
Gary's in town?
- He left.
But we should call Crane.
- Crane knows all about it.
I'm sorry.
- Tell me something. I'm a little confused
by bachelor number one
and bachelor number two.
Are you screwing Crane Curtis
for protection or sport?
Your daughter, how does she feel about it?
- Don't you bring Griff into this.
You don't know anything. - Why?
It's my fault, Einar, right?
Isn't it my fault?
Isn’t everything my fault?
Griffin flipped a coin.
- What are you talking about?
Griffin flipped a coin and I lost.
That's why I was the one driving.
It was 3 o'clock in the morning
and we were both tired.
We wanted to make it down
to the rodeo in Great Falls.
It was a flipped coin? What was it?
Was it a quarter? Was it a nickel?
I don't remember what it was.
- I want to know what killed my boy.
I killed him, Einar.
Is that what you want to hear?
It wasn't the change in our pockets,
or the weak ass coffee or the rain.
It was me.
I fell asleep
and I flipped the car 6 times.
I killed Griffin.
You've got no argument from me.
You think it's something I forget?
You think that I'm not sick
with it every day of my life?
I tried to keep living and you haven't.
Is that why you hate me so much?
You know, you act like I killed you
the day Griffin died. Well, great.
Lie all the way down and we'll bury you.
What's the matter? You are afraid
no one will come to the funeral?
We talk about your leaving in the morning.
- We're done talking.
Just so you know...
I have been trying.
Forgiving...
This isn't easy for me.
Mitch. What does he know? Does he think
he's a preacher or some goddamn thing?
I'm sorry we woke you up so early.
- I'm not a great sleeper anyway.
I've got a mattress in the storage shed.
Maybe you and I can wrestle it in here.
Did you drink the whole bottle?
She left.
She walked out of here and took the kid.
Was that her idea or yours?
- I didn't drink the whole thing.
Which side of your ass do you want
the needle in this morning? - Left.
What'd you dream about last night?
- I didn't dream at all.
I lay awake wondering if you would ever
stop blaming the world for whatever...
wondering if you'd be able to hold on
to the family you've got.
I managed to hang on to you, haven't I?
Have you ever wondered
why I'm the only one left?
Well, I have my boy. I have his memories.
Yeah.
Maybe you remember how desperately
he wanted to get the hell out of here,
how bad he wanted a life of his own.
- If you weren't a cripple,
I'd kick your ass.
- Talk sense.
I never saw the day you thought
you could kick my ass, Einar.
Einar!
- What?
I want to go see the bear.
- You've seen the bear.
Take me to Angie. - You're not up to it.
I'm not asking permission, goddamn it.
I want a ride.
- Then call a taxi!
I'm going back. - What?
I'm going back.
I stay with grandpa. - The hell you are.
Yes, I am.
No! You are not going anywhere.
You're staying right here.
I'm going back, ok?
You make decisions like they don't matter
for anybody else but you!
That is not true.
I always think about you first.
Then it should start to show.
Griff! Get back here!
I'm not going to say it again.
Let her go. Let her go be
with her grandfather for awhile.
Do you think I'm a shitty mother?
- I think you're doing the best you can.
That's her second grade picture.
Your daughter?
- Yeah.
We were having a picnic
at the river and...
She went for a swim.
She wanted to practice.
She was a great swimmer.
And I...
I looked away for a minute.
And she was gone.
She was...
I would do anything
to have that minute back.
But I'm never gonna.
Nina.
We're not supposed
to outlive our children.
You have to understand that about Einar.
Where's your mother?
- She's staying with Nina.
You walked the way out here by yourself?
- I got hungry.
You want one egg or two? We've got a lot
to do today. - How about two?
What are we going to do with that?
- We're going to spread it around.
We don't have to walk.
Slide on over here and take the wheel.
Come on. - I can't drive.
You're not going to be driving.
You're going to be steering. You can
do it. Turn before you get to that fence.
Don't touch anything else.
Yeah.
Set.
Six o'clock in the morning, I wake up
to gunfire. I look out the window
and everything's shot. - It's pottery.
Still, shouldn't you be catching people
who shoot the neighborhood up?
Why the hell didn't you tell me
Gary was in town? Excuse me.
Ronny.
I didn't think you'd want to see him.
- Well, I had a right to know.
I would have thought you've had enough
of him. - Come on, Crane.
What do you really wanna know? Why didn't
I just walk away the first time he hit me?
Why didn't I just call the police? Right?
- Are you gonna deal with this or what?
Just give me a second here, Jonesy. Jean.
I couldn't care less about his problems.
There's a buffalo over there.
His name is Ronny.
Then there's two wolves, Tom and Jerry.
Come on. Look.
Food.
Come on.
Aren't you hungry?
You had enough?
Yeah.
Yeah, I've had enough of him.
No. That's ok. I've got to run
to the feed store for a minute.
You think you can fix Mitch some lunch?
Sure.
- Ok, then.
Einar!
Einar!
Mitch?
- Griff.
Get Einar for me. - He went to town.
Oh, no.
Do you know where he keeps my medicine?
- In the refrigerator?
Go get it for me. - Right now?
As quick as you can.
Ok.
Ok.
- Ok. Good girl.
You got it? You know how to load it?
You just... That's it.
Ok.
Just pull my pants down...
stick it in me and push the plunger down.
Was that ok?
- Yes, it was.
You're so smooth
I thought my mama had done it.
Thank you.
Hey.
Jean.
As it turns out, you're right.
I'm a complete asshole.
I never judged you for being with him,
though. You're wrong about that.
You made it stop, you left him.
You wanna know the ugly little truth?
You stay because you don't think
you deserve any better.
Because you think
it's the best you can do.
It's Mr. Bradley.
How you doing?
- We can't just leave him there, Einar.
We walked into his business.
Hell, he was just doing what bears do.
We can't punish him for that.
You gotta let him go, Einar.
Get him out of that cage.
Why would you lie here
and think I'm gonna do that?
You know,
I can get myself shaved in the morning.
All the way dressed, too. - Yeah, ok.
I could probably manage to stick myself
in the butt with one of those syringes
if it came to it.
But what I can't do...
is continue to watch you mourn for a life
you think you should've had.
There are people everywhere who think
they got dealt a bad hand, Einar.
Hey.
Did I give him too much?
- No.
You did great today.
I don't know.
I can't do anything right.
Well, what do you think?
Lift. That a girl.
Let's try third. - Third?
All right.
Now steer it to the left. Not too hard.
There. That's good.
You're getting the hang of it.
There you go.
I think we're gonna get this thing done.
Hey, Griff. How's life on the ranch?
It's good.
Jean, you got two customers out here.
Hey.
- We're just visiting. Ok?
Ok.
I miss you. What have you been doing?
Einar's been teaching me
how to drive his truck. - Now, why...
don't you go see what Nina's got
in the kitchen for a special? Ok?
Ok.
Would you care if I took her camping?
- Thanks for bringing her in, Einar.
Did she say "driving"?
- It's a ranch.
She's 11.
- I know, I know.
But she's a good girl.
Good kids don't get that way by accident.
Is that a compliment?
- It's just the way it is.
What else you been teaching her?
I don't know enough...
to know what to...
teach a girl.
What I'm saying...
is if you want to come back to the ranch,
that's... That's gonna be ok.
Maybe tomorrow then, when you get back.
Tomorrow would be fine.
I think camping would be great.
She'll love that.
Do you want all of these?
- Yeah, all of them. Hold on to those.
What's the medicine for?
- When we get that bear in the cage,
I'm gonna give him a shot. That way
he can sleep all the way up the mountain.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
- Jesus Christ, Gary.
How are you?
God, you look great.
I thought you left town.
- Well, I wanted to see you.
You know I miss you.
I don't want you here, Gary.
Can't you understand that?
It must be nice for Griff living up here
with her grandfather.
Country living and all.
Of course, it's not for you.
Just give it up, Gary.
I'm not coming back to you.
Can we just at least sit down and have
a drink or some kind... Offer me a coffee.
Or something.
It's pretty country up here.
I might stick around awhile.
We're gonna get caught.
- These are government guys
we're stealing this from.
They went home to dinner a long time ago.
I thought you said we were borrowing it.
- As long as I pay my taxes,
it's the same thing.
Ok. Now scoot on over
and get ready to back up.
Go on ahead, easy. Come on.
Oh!
Ok.
Here.
Hold that still. When I tell you,
you start cranking. - Ok.
I'm a little bit scared.
- That makes two of us.
Start cranking.
Ok, now get in the truck.
Come on.
Einar!
Einar, I'm sorry.
- Get behind me. Get in the truck.
Walk slowly and don't look right at him.
Get in the truck!
Go on.
Look here.
Einar!
Are you ok?
I think the bear tore at me.
I think we better get me to a hospital.
Sorry.
Hello?
What?
No, I was just...
pulling the loft door down, you know...
to keep the bats out, because once
those bats get in the rafters...
Then you can't hardly get them out.
And that's when he fell.
- Right, that's when I fell.
It's just dumb. What the hell was I doing?
- Let's try this again, Einar.
Oh, no.
I hit the gearshift.
I didn't mean to.
- It wasn't your fault.
It was an accident.
You did everything just right tonight.
As well as your dad could have done.
I guess God kept me alive to bring her
into the world.
But every day, I wish...
I wish it was me that died
in that car instead of Griffin.
I wish you both had lived.
I was falling down drunk the night
that Mitch got mauled.
That's why I couldn't get the bear off him
before I did.
He never said anything about it.
- He never would.
You.
I'm not just gonna lie-down here.
Just keep going.
Heard you made one hell of a fall, Einar.
You're lucky you only cracked two ribs.
It was the soft part of the yard.
Am I finished?
- Not yet. I'm gonna keep you here,
make sure your spleen is ok.
- I'm fine.
I'll check back on you this afternoon.
- So you can double bill me?
Seems fair to me. You are twice
the trouble. Let's give it a day or two.
I'm not giving him a couple of days.
Einar.
Ok?
Yeah, I'm fine. I've gotten clumsy.
- Mitch.
Mitch, we set the bear free.
I know.
Thank you.
You want me to run
some breakfast out to Mitch? - No.
Usually coffee is enough for him
in the morning.
You know...
She could go to school here.
It's not a bad school.
Jimmy.
Stay there!
What do you want, Gary?
- It's time to come home, baby.
I love you, Jean.
You love me?
That's what your love feels like.
- Bitch!
Mom!
- Don't you hit me! Don't you hit me!
Mom, are you ok?
- No!
Let her go, Gary!
- Are you coming or staying?
Hey! Take your hands off her!
- What the hell?
Get in the car! Get in there!
Griff, get out of the car.
- Griff!
Goddamn it, Griff!
- Mom!
Come on!
Mom!
Mom!
That's enough, Einar!
You leave her alone. Now come on here.
Come on, get. Get out of here.
Get away, you greedy little bugger.
She didn't do anything to you.
That's Mitchell. He's a boy.
Yeah.
Come on. Get out of here.
Paloma. Paloma, Nebraska.
What about you, Mitch? You know anything
about this? - About what?
So you don't know anything about it?
I just drove him home from the hospital.
Hello, Officer Curtis.
- Good afternoon there, Griff.
Einar.
Would you stay for lunch today?
- Yeah, I might.
I've got to speak to your grandfather
for a second, though, first.
Heck, it can wait. Let me grab that
for you. So how was she today?
Looks good?
- Yeah.
I think it might rain today.
No, it's gonna stay warm.
- I said it might rain.
Would you bury me next to Griffin?
Don't you think you ought to die first?
It's gonna happen, you know.
- Where else do you think I'd bury you?
That's where my family lies.
Do you think
the dead really care about our lives?
Yeah, I think they do.
I think they forgive us our sins.
I even think it's easy for them.
Griff said you had a dream about flying.
Yeah.
I got so high, Einar, I could see
where the blue turns to black.
From up there, you can see all there is.
And it looked like...
There was a reason for everything.
