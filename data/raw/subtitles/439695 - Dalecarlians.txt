DALECARLIANS
Hey, I can't come in today.
I'm in the car on the way to Dalecarlia.
I'm going to fetch a lamp
for my new apartment.
And my father's turning 70
so I'm going this weekend -
- to avoid hearing how, I never
come up, not even for dad's birthday!
A party, are you nuts!
In my family you just have cake.
Cake, cake, cake...
- Hello...
- I told father I heard the car.
But he said he didn't hear any car...
- Hello, mother.
- Hello...
- Have you changed your car?
- That was about six months ago.
- Happy birthday, father.
- Thanks.
- What could this be?
- You'll have to open it. Go on.
- How was the drive?
- Good.
I was just a bit tired. A group of us
from work went out yesterday.
- We were celebrating my promotion.
- I'll say.
- Did you hear, father?
- Yes...
- Didn't you like where you were?
- Yes, but I'm staying at Ericsson.
Instead of programming I'll be
something called a systems architect.
It's really good.
The salary is much better.
In Bali, you see,
I drank coconut milk.
Can you imagine?
They took them directly from the trees.
And the men, they climbed up, right
to the top of those palm things-
- and then they threw them down,
can you imagine? Isn't that something?
Really, Margot,
now you must open your mouth!
It's my father's birthday today,
so I was hoping to get away on time.
We usually help one another,
don't we?
Gosh, now you are making
me happy, aren't you?
Just think how pleased I am!
She's finally managed
to find her way home.
- My little sister...
- Yes...
Hi, Ida. You're so big now.
It's been some time.
But look at you...
Are you going to a funeral?
- Thanks.
- You can't say that!
I don't understand that fashion.
Dressing in black makes no one happy.
But you'll stay now for a few days
so we can take care of you?
I have to leave tomorrow.
Please, must we talk
about when I'm leaving-
- can't we just
enjoy that fact that I'm here now?
- Yes, it's just...
- Why can't you take a few days off?
- Let her be!
- Okay, okay...
Have you got time to come to town?
I could use a hand.
I just got here,
I haven't eaten or anything.
There's a children's party at the
centre, so we won't get in before one.
Then the whole afternoon will be
busy, busy...
- What are we doing at the centre?
- Setting the tables for the party.
Ida, aren't you going to play
the song you made up?
Yes, the whole family had a
stomach bug, so Ida made up a song...
Ida, tell grandad what it's called.
The Stomach Bug.
I haven't heard anything
about a party.
Of course you haven't, it's a
surprise party! Not so, father?
You haven't heard anything about
a party? Ida, go ahead and play!
- Gunilla.
- Where the hell are you?
I'm on the way! I'm just grabbing
some yoghurt before I catch the bus.
Yes... Great! Say hello from me.
Bye bye.
I'm not saying anything, but I don't
know what Gunilla is doing in Falun.
She sits in a little two room flat
staring at the walls.
Tommy went there to help her put up
shelves as her children had no time.
He said the kitchen was so small
you could barely turn around.
And if you got into the toilet
you had to back out.
Why do you need such a nice car
like this in the city?
- And a BMW? It's a guy's car.
- It's Ericsson. They have a deal...
There's Ingvar!
- Hi...
- Hi...
- Where are you going?
- To Vika to track an injured moose.
Some bloody idiot
put two bullets in it's arse.
So now they've sent for a real
marksman to go over there-
- and clean up after the boys...
It's been a while since
we saw your mug around here.
Mother is so happy to have
her little girl home.
If you're really nice to your uncle,
Mia-
- I'll see to it that you take some
moose meat back to Stockholm.
Okay! Mine works as well!
- Bloody idiot. Bye.
- Bye...
- You know where the flower shop is?
- Yes.
Then I'll see you in the supermarket
in thirty minutes.
Hello, OIle.
- Mia, isn't it?
- Yes...
Don't you recognise me?
Eva's sister...
- Eva Bäckström, from your class.
- Right...
- Yes!
- Yes...
Yes... Well, how is Eva, then?
Good. She had twins this
spring, so things are very busy.
- She has four children now.
- Really... Well...
- How about you? Any children yet?
- No.
- No...
- I work a lot, so it's bad timing.
- And I don't live with anyone.
- Yes, that's one way of doing things.
- Yes... Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I have to rush. We're throwing
a party for my father today.
- I heard about that!
- Yes.
- Well, say hello to Eva.
- I will do.
- Take care, now.
- You too.
It took 30 minutes
before the moose hit the ground.
But let me tell you, the others had
been hunting it for hours.
But I just got there and glimpsed him
crouching behind BritGunnar's barn.
So I shot him and went my way.
- You want some coffee?
- Yes, thanks.
I met Eivor and Mia on the way.
- What did you think of her car?
- It must be going well for her.
And she's bought an apartment.
In the centre of town.
Jesus, that costs real money that,
so they say.
Aren't you going to show
the voucher to him, father?
- How's Kerstin?
- She's at home ironing my best suit.
What do you say, Kalle?
Isn't that what women are for?
Oh, my God!
- The bet's placed.
- Look there!
Isn't that Mia Sundin?
Mia, can you fetch Gunilla at the
station? Ida and I will go with Tommy.
- He's picking up the grog.
- Eivor!
- Well, well, well, well...
- Hello!
How nice! It's been such a long time.
How long has it been since
I really hugged you properly, girl?
So, how are things? How are you?
How is work?
- And the new flat?
- Fine, fine...
But, goodness, you're pretty today!
- You look like one of those TV stars.
- Mia!
Go and fetch Gunilla at the station.
I'll see you later.
- Yes...
- Look who I found...
My favourite girl! Hurry so that Gunilla
doesn't think you've forgotten her.
- But how are you?
- Me?
- Great! Hurry up...
- See you later, then.
Nice hat!
Oh come on, mum...!
You must go to Bali sometime.
It was... It was absolutely fantastic.
It was an incredible experience.
I was in Malaysia and Thailand two
years ago and thought of going there.
But then we stayed on
in Singapore instead.
I've never been abroad, you know...
Håkan and I
never got further than Norway.
But now I feel that,
a trip like that to the sun...
- You want that every year, don't you?
- Yes.
That would make you happier.
I wonder what sort of crap
will happen today.
Am I wrong? Since Arvid shot himself,
there's always crap on Kalle's birthday.
It was ten years ago today.
- We don't need to talk about that now.
- Why not? He's dead.
Barbro doesn't like it
being talked about.
- Was it last year Tommy cut himself?
- No.
- That was two years ago.
- Last year Ida was allergic to the nuts.
Boy, did she change colour.
Red to blue in 30 seconds...
Ingvar, that wasn't funny.
It could have ended badly.
Arvid knew what he was doing when
he shot himself on Kalle's birthday.
Otherwise no one would remember
when he blew his brains out.
Just think how happy
Kalle and Anna will be.
- Now that Mia is home.
- I was at the grave.
- I can't bring myself to go there.
- Mum, it was ten years ago.
I pity him.
I really pity him.
He didn't belong here.
He didn't belong here.
- Hi!
- Hi...
- How did it go?
- Fine.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Hello revellers!
Don't look!
Happy birthday, father.
Flowers from Bali.
Can you imagine?
There was a little girl of about six
selling these on the streets.
Hoodwinking tourists
into buying shit...
Mia here... Hey...
- Gunilla, would you like some coffee?
- That'd be nice.
Yes, they're in my computer...
No, you don't need a password
to get into that file.
It's no problem.
Just call if there's anything else.
- Ciao...
- You sound like you're from Stockholm!
I happen to live there,
that may have something to do with it.
You happen to be born here.
And that makes it surprising you
suddenly talk some kind of martian...
Try getting taken seriously when you
have a presentation for 50 people-
- and you speak
in a backwater accent.
So you have to speak Martian
instead. That's much better...
They think they'll be going up
in a spaceship.
Have you seen any famous people
in Stockholm lately?
I saw Björn Borg in a store.
He was trying on hats.
Jesus...
I'm just kidding you...
- Where are you going?
- Out to the barn.
- What are you going to do there?
- Fetch some things for my apartment.
Come and sit down a while. Father
and I have something to tell you.
We thought that... Father and I
were talking this morning...
Well, if you want the plot
down at the lake, you can have it.
Tou can build something on it.
It doesn't have to be big, just...
A summer cottage... So you could
have your own place when you visit.
- Hi!
- You don't need to decide now.
Gosh, it's busy here...
Is it someone's birthday?
Mia has been given
the plot at the lake.
Mia... Take the damn plot
and sell it to the highest bidder.
There are a lots speculators
after that land, you know...
Isn't that so, Eivor?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out to the barn.
It's gone very quiet in here...
Are we going to have any coffee?
Helena, tie your laces.
Johan, help Ida with the drinks,
they're too heavy for her.
Go ahead, I'll be along later.
I want to be alone.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd wait for you.
I want to be alone.
Eivor...
Listen... just tell me
what the matter is.
Mia has been given
the plot down at the lake.
Listen...
Open up...
- We don't need a plot...
- It's not that! It's our daughters!
Helena should have had it!
And it so bloody typical they give it
to Mia when she doesn't even want it!
Eivor...
It would be nice
if Mia builds something.
She would come up more often.
So...
you're as big a help as usual, then.
Are you coming? Are the others
expected to do everything?
There go Eivor's daughters.
- When are your kids coming?
- Lasse's busy, but Victoria comes today.
- That's nice.
- Yes... She'll stay with Håkan.
- Really?
- Yes. They're disappointed in me.
That I broke up the family...
But it will be fine.
And you? How are you?
I haven't even asked you...
So much has happened. I never
thought my life would be like this.
I never thought so...
- Do you have any contact with Håkan?
- He calls me a menopausal cow.
But that's what I am, aren't I?
- I think you look really well.
- You think so?
- Yes...
- No! Do you really think so?
- Hi.
- Gunilla, good, come and help here.
Okay.
- Hi... How are you?
- Good.
- I've been making potato salad all day.
- Right...
- Hello, auntie...
- Hi...
- This is my boyfriend, Johan.
- Hello.
- Gunilla!
- Be careful...
Who was it that took out my old fur?
Hmm?
Well, I thought it was mother's.
Just don't forget to put it back
before you leave.
Lift it properly and we'll move it over
to the other place.
Really,
how have you placed the tables?
Tommy, Ingvar...
You blow up the balloons.
- Stina, help me with the tables.
- Mia...
Have you seen these? No...?
I thought we could
place them around father's seat.
Come on, Gunilla...
Father doesn't want pink flowers.
But they're so nice.
Well... do what you like.
But I don't think he'll appreciate it.
- You put them out.
- Stina? Have you put the salad away?
Yes, I have.
- How's it going with the balloons?
- It's fun, Johan...
It's nice... that you are going
to build something.
I didn't think you ever would.
I haven't made up my mind,
I just promised to look at it.
Yes, but that you are interested...
I wouldn't have thought so.
That's good. Then maybe
I can get help with mother and father.
- Now that Gunilla has moved to Falun.
- Yes, I love it there.
Really, you should have seen
the flowers they had in Bali.
I've never seen the like.
If you get the chance, go there!
It's the best thing I've ever done.
Some of us think it's better
here at home.
We don't think all this travelling
around is so special.
- Not everyone has that need.
- I've always had that need.
But you've always had the possibility.
When Gunilla and I turned 18, no one
asked if we wanted to study abroad.
- No one asked me, I just did it.
- Mother would never have let us go.
But what the hell is this?
Why would someone put a
dirty tablecloth in the cupboard?
It's typical of the centre. People don't
give a damn about public spaces.
Well, if it isn't the shrimp.
- Do you need any help?
- Did you hear, Mia?
Jan-Olov couldn't piss for a week.
His machinery totally broke down.
After three days he squeezed out
one tiny drop.
They had to take him to the hospital
so he wouldn't implode...
Christ, it's that bloody...
- Out!
- Leave it alone!
Fucking cat, I get so mad.
Why do people have bloody cats...!
- Whose telephone is ringing?
- Goodness, I bought a cellphone!
- Is Barbro home?
- Yes.
- I'm just popping over to Barbro's.
- Do that, she'll be really happy.
Mia? Barbro has folded the serviettes.
Bring them back.
Barbro? Do you remember
an Eva from my class?
Eva Bäckström? She was
the one with the buck teeth.
Yes...
What about her?
Her little sister said hello
when I was in town.
I didn't recognise her. I didn't know
who she was talking about.
- People greet me and I don't know them.
- That's not so strange.
You haven't lived here
for fifteen years.
Barbro, you should put floor
heating in here. It's freezing cold.
I did that in my hall...
and also in the bathroom.
Who helped you with that, then?
Some nice bloke, maybe?
I don't have a man.
No, I've been working...
- I don't have time for love.
- Listen to you...
How are you, really?
It's been a bit much is all.
They didn't take care of the forest.
They cleared it to hunt. Bloody idiots.
None of the children can come.
- What about Victoria?
- The train ticket was too expensive.
- She must have known that earlier?
- Yes.
But it's good that they have
their own lives, isn't it?
- I think that's good.
- It's okay like that!
I think so.
- Where are you going now?
- Toilet.
Don't cry...
Don't cry... don't cry...
You are strong.
You are courageous.
You are good. You are good.
Barbro? Why are you always
so nice to me?
Because you need it.
Quiet young girls
that stick to themselves...
...you have to keep
an extra close watch on them.
Even when they grow up.
You know, no one has asked me
anything. Not even mother and father.
But you should know that they talk
about you a lot when you aren't here.
It's just...
I don't think anyone
even knows what I work with.
What about Eivor and Gunilla?
Aren't they interested?
Are you kidding? Eivor?
She's not interested in anything that
happens outside of the county border.
Well... you should just tell them
about what you do.
Even if they don't ask. That's what
everyone else does. Just gab on...
But isn't it nuts?
My family doesn't know what I do.
They don't even know where I live.
No one has come to visit me in years.
Everyone just goes on
about me coming up.
But if I moved here,
if I started working here-
- then they'd be interested
in what I do. Isn't that so?
Because that's all that counts.
To live in Dalecarlia.
This morning,
they gave me the plot at the lake.
- You're not serious?
- You should have seen Eivor's face.
- Don't worry about her.
- She may as well have it.
- You can at least look at it!
- Stop it. Don't you start as well!
- You should support me.
- But it's a good piece of land!
- Stop it, Barbro, I don't want it.
- Hi.
- You know what Mia has in her hall?
- No idea...
- Floor heating.
- Goodness, imagine that?
I know... You must show Mia
how nicely you've done things up.
You must...
Take her with you and show her.
- He's fixed it up so nicely.
- But I'm not done.
Forget it, I'm so used
to doing it myself. Take her with you.
It's really nice now...
Thanks.
- Have you started hunting?
- No, no... It's dad's.
- I'm just cleaning it.
- So...
So does your girlfriend
live here too?
- Camilla?
- Yes.
No, no, we're not...
She moved out.
Haven't you made your way through
all the girls in the village yet?
Oh, no...
There should be a couple left.
Really... You don't say.
You always used to go on about
how important it was not to stay here.
It hasn't been the right time.
And then after dad died...
- Mum is starting to get old.
- You're starting to get old.
Maybe I'm one of those.
That stays...
Shit! It's Eivor.
I'm leaving...
Well, I'm going, I'll see you later.
Pregnant, are we?
- I was out last night.
- Weaker than I thought...
Listen... Don't say anything to Eivor.
We'll see.
I heard that Skagg is going to drill
wells in Africa. He's getting shit pay.
Well, he'll get a proper tan anyway.
Totally free.
If you go there you should go as a
soldier. Man, they get well paid!
I think you got a good deal.
But you should change the track.
- Who's the girl hanging around here?
- Mia Sundin.
- Really?
- Hello...
Can you help me at the centre?
Eivor's taking Mia for a walk.
- Bye.
- Bye...
- She's going to show her the land.
- What land?
It's a pity we don't do something
together. We coud go somewhere.
- To Bali, for instance?
- Gunilla, it's a lovely idea...
- But I have to work a lot now...
- How do you actually live?
You could say that I live
a different life to you two, anyway.
- You two?
- Yes, you both have families.
And...?
Well, you never go out to bars.
You never go further than to Rättvik.
I actually got a divorce
and went to Bali.
But you both married
the first guys you met.
Yes, yes you're right.
I married the first, best guy
I met and I'm proud of that.
Because up here, you see,
you don't get tired of your man.
You stick together here. You endure,
and that's what called a relationship.
It's no amusement park
or rock concert here, you see.
This is love. True love.
Love that costs a little.
If you don't dare to have that kind
of love, you shouldn't have a man.
Have you calmed down, now?
So you think I should accept the first,
best guy that shows interest?
I didn't mean it like that.
And stick with some sad old man
half my life like Gunilla has done?
Just to prove to everyone that I can
endure because that's what love is.
Oh, come on, you run
as soon as anyone gets close to you.
What do you know about that?
You don't actually know me.
Oh, I know you...
You know, you should see me
on a Wednesday night-
- at three when I'm sitting
in a taxi from Stureplan-
- so drunk that I ask the driver to stop
so I can throw up before we continue.
- You think I'm na: I: Ve?
- We know about that.
Let me tell you something, that if
I could afford to take a taxi even once-
- or had time to get drunk
so I throw up, I'd be bloody happy!
- You don't even know what I work with.
- Yes, I do.
- Really? What do I do?
- Don't be so aggressive.
- What do I work with?
- Calm down.
You work with computers.
- What do you mean, computers?
- You work with computers.
- "Work with computers"!
- That was really mature... imitating me.
I'm not really mature
according to you.
Not mature in the way
you obviously think one should be.
You don't know anything
about my life. Not a damn!
You're standing on the plot,
just so you know.
So... you thinking
of running away now?
You can forget about that!
What the hell are you doing?!
- Stop it!
- Now you're going to get it!
- You do that and I'II...
- What?
- I'll fucking kill you! Let me go...
- What'll happen? Tell me!
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
- You should always help the underdog.
- Are you nuts?
- Where are you going?
- Ingvar's chalet.
- Can I come?
- I have to fetch some lights. Sure.
- What the hell are you doing here?!
- What the hell are you doing here?
I was told to fetch the lights.
Has something happened?
I'm just taken aback.
I forgot about the lights.
Kerstin caught a stomach bug, so I
ran away not to catch the damn thing.
- So she's not coming to the party?
- What do you think? She's throwing up!
I'll go and see
if I can find that thing...
- What's his problem?
- No idea.
Thanks for saving me. You know...
What do you think
of the snowmobile?
- I won some money on the horses.
- Flames? That's real mature.
It can't be easy for you.
Over thirty and living alone, people
think something's wrong with you.
- Isn't there, though?
- No, why should there be?
Bye...
Christ... see you at the centre.
- That long?
- Yes.
My dear, you look frozen!
Father, let Mia get into the bath first,
then you can jump in later.
- Sure.
- That will be good, won't it?
We're done at the centre. Eivor
wanted to do the last things herself.
Okay...
Hello...
I thought you'd like a drink.
Yes, I'd love one...
I'll leave you alone.
Haven't you changed yet?
- What are you fiddling with?
- Dad's watch.
I thought I'd get it working.
Can you help me with my blouse?
Why... Why did he kill himself?
What kind of question is that?
We're going to a party!
I don't want to talk about that now.
It's no fun at all.
- But we never talk about it.
- There's nothing to talk about.
It was too bad for him.
Get dressed now!
- Open up!
- Mother!
- Can I take your sequined bag?
- Open!
- Lf you empty it first.
- Eivor, have you seen my pants?
I ironed them.
They're in the laundry room.
Mother, I can't find it!
You stupid idiot. Open!
Open up!
Mother? Why was I on my own
so much when I was small?
You wanted to be alone.
Did father tell you that... if you want
to build something, we'll help you.
You look really nice, mother.
Hello.
- Where shall I put his gift?
- Over there.
- Hello, Tore.
- Hello.
As talkative as always.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Listen, you say I don't know
anything about your life.
Let's just get this straight.
- You know nothing of mine!
- Mother!
I've said my piece
and you've said yours.
Now we won't talk about it,
because it's father's night tonight.
But mother... Grandfather is coming.
He's arrived. Has everyone come?
Can we all stand over here
so he sees us when he comes in.
Tore! Yes, thanks!
Pour one for me as well.
- Where's Kerstin?
- She's got a stomach bug.
- How was I meant to know?
- What is it with her?
Don't worry about her.
She's just a little stressed.
Try and enjoy yourself instead.
It's a party.
Yes, may he live
Yes, may he live
Yes, may he live
until his hundredth year
Of course he will live
Of course he will live
Of course he will live
until his hundredth year
- I don't know what to say.
- Give him a drink, he'll come through.
Well, it's like this...
You can sit where you like,
plates are on the table.
The buffet is here
and drinks are at the bar.
There's beer, wine and soft drinks
to accompany the food and...
- lf you want, something stronger.
- Yes, thanks!
There's a really big one in Stockholm.
It's close to St Eriksplan.
Have you been there lately?
You know where St Eriksplan is?
- It's on a parallel street...
- I glassed in the terrace last summer.
But it was so damn hot in there-
- I had to build a new terrace,
so now you can sit inside and out.
But, I wonder if I shouldn't
put a roof on that terrace anyway.
Then I could actually
build another terrace, you see.
And have that terrace without a roof.
One in glass, one with a roof...
And then just a straight terrace.
Then you have everythig.
Yes...
Well... I'd just like to make a toast-
- for Kalle... To you.
- Cheers, father!
- Cheers. And thanks for the gift, Mia.
He got a gift voucher
at the DIY store for 5000 crowns!
- 5000?
- Yes.
I'm the smallest in the brood
I hardly get any food
'Cause the one I live with,
the one I live with is called Kalle!
He gives me fish every single day
And I just don't want to stay
I want some red wine,
I want some red wine and gorgonzola!
I have a 53 square metre,
two room apartment, but...
- God...
- Not everyone has horses at home.
Mia, have you heard that in Furudal...
- They have wolves at their doors.
- No...
You can thank
the government for that.
Excuse me.
Have you got a glass of water
for father?
He'll fall asleep before the cake
if he continues drinking at this pace!
- Mia is in fine spirits.
- Yes.
She thought it was nice talking
to Hans and Inga. That's nice.
Goodness, haven't you put
the coffee on? Oh dear...
The afternoon was terrible, but I've had
a few shots so it all feels better now.
I have to hang up.
I've got to check something. Bye.
Kerstin wants a divorce.
She said so this morning.
Fucking women.
Just complicate things...
Is it something you've...
She said something before summer,
but what the hell!
She goes on like all women do! You
listen to half of it you get a headache!
The chalet belongs to her family.
If she takes that from me,
I'll never forgive her.
Do you want to go home?
Ingvar, I'm here...
- Hi, we're the entertainment.
- Hello.
Hello... Mia, can you fetch
more alcohol? Welcome...
It's going to be a surprise.
Father doesn't know about it.
- Ida?
- No...
- Yes, go and fetch your violin.
- No.
- Grandfather would love it.
- Not now.
Tommy, can you fetch Ida's violin?
It's wonderful you could come, boys.
Many thanks...
Have you gone crazy?!
- What is it?
- You can't go in with that!
- Relax! Why're you so angry with me?
- You know how people are.
They think they'll go blind.
- That's not what I meant.
- Jan-Olov, help Mia with the alcohol.
Of course.
- How are things at your table?
- Good, really good.
- You want one?
- Sure.
Do you remember when
you were in love with me?
It was tough having you
following me around all the time.
- You could stare at me for hours.
- Stop it...
Following me all the time...
I could barely go to the toilet.
I was six...
Has it ever occured to you-
- that I did so because it was
exciting being with someone older?
I'm still older...
This is my family's present to father.
A little bird whispered
to me that you're single.
Well? Are you?
Concentrate on the alcohol instead.
- They're asking after the alcohol.
- We're just camouflaging it.
Right.
- It's going well with the girls, I see.
- Yeah...
There's a certain demand.
Down in the village.
- You don't say?
- There are a few that want to...
- Are you interested though?
- Me? No...
So, are you single?
- Where's the alcohol?
- It's coming!
- So you are single?
- Yes.
What about him?
The one that came up?
That fell on his arse when he wanted
to ride the snowmobile?
- Huh?
- What about him?
- You're not together with him?
- Together...? We hung out a while.
- What a party!
- Yes.
- Your dad's enjoying himself.
- Stop proposing. Bring in the alcohol.
- Where's the alcohol?
- For Christ's sake!
Gosh he's nice, isn't he?
I think he's so nice!
- Jan-Olov?
- No, in the band. The dark one.
- Isn't he?
- Yes.
I could imagine jumping him...
- Are you drunk?
- God, no...!
Or yes... I probably am.
But it wasn't that.
Goodness... God, I can't be drunk
in front of mother and father.
Gunilla, you're actually an adult!
Hold the funnel and I'll pour.
I don't feel like an adult.
I think I became an adult so young-
- that I have to take a break from it.
So that's why you divorced Håkan?
He was unfaithful to me.
I haven't told anyone. He was
with someone at a conference.
So I took my chance
and threw him out.
- Why not tell mother and father?
- You know how people talk.
I didn't want to give him a bad name.
I thought the children
would be disappointed in him.
Better if they're angry with me.
Stina and Helena
are going to sing now.
I blew in my pipe
And a little dove came out
Her name was Emma-Stina
I took her in my arms
I was with someone in Bali.
A really fantastic guy.
His name was River.
Can you imagine?
Such a beautiful name.
He was so positive.
A really generous person.
He dared to show his feelings.
- Do you want to see him?
- No, we...
He's American,
from where you studied.
- What, San Francisco?
- Yes.
He moved me so...
It was as if he liked my body...
You understand?
He thought I was lovely...
Håkan never liked my body,
he never did...
I don't think he ever did.
- How old is he?
- Thirty two.
Oh, excuse me.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Is it something with me?
With you and me? With us?
No... No, Tommy.
I don't feel
like talking about this today.
We'll do it tomorrow.
Next weekend, you and me
and the children will take the skis-
- and we'll go up to the cabin
and sleep over and make a fire.
Barbecue some sausages...
You know... No...
- What is it?
- Nothing...
Go out with the tray,
I'll get the bucket.
- I love you, Mia.
- Why do you say that?
I never said so...
Hello Kerstin, it's Eivor here.
How's your stomach?
You've always been so strong.
Courageous...
You've managed on your own.
It's easy then
to forget to say things like that.
- I love you.
- Do you want a beer?
Yes, that'd be nice!
Get it together.
Come on, get it together.
Ingvar? Ingvar!
I think it's time for you to go home.
- What, is the party over?
- I talked to Kerstin.
Damn woman, I'm not going home.
Oh dear, what have we here?
What the hell do you all want?
Why can't you ever be happy?
Why must you think and think
all the time? Why can't you just live?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Damn egotists, that's what you are!
You just think of yourselves!
And read about others who've strangled
their husbands and left the country!
- I don't understand what you're...
- You never understood anything!
And when you, for the first time
in your life, dared to make a decision-
- then you decided
to leave your family.
But, Ingvar...
I'm going into the hospital on Monday.
Whatever I do it turns out wrong.
I try to do well,
but itjust turns out wrong.
Then I hear that I was lame...
Now that I've finally
gotten myself together...
I get called an egoist!
- Have you given up already?
- Shit...
The party's hardly begun.
Now damnit... It's about time
someone got this wake going!
- I just wanted to tell someone.
- Of course you wanted to.
- But how...?
- I don't want to talk about it now.
Not... not right now, anyway.
Then we won't...
Now that I've finally found myself...
...I'm just someone
that people find embarrassing.
Goodness... are you in here?
Here I am crying when there's a party
going on. You can't do that, can you?
Keep smiling! That's what everyone
in Bali said, that I was so happy.
They thought that was nice.
What...?
Yes! That wasn't a day too soon.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Damn cat!
You shit!
- You little...
- Ingvar, now you're being childish.
You let Helena drive you home,
then Kerstin put you to bed.
Then you talk
about this tomorrow like adults.
I don't know what you're up to,
but this is no way to resolve problems!
Nothing gets better when you cut
down a tree that belongs to the town!
Christ, you're so boring...!
It's like watching paint dry...
So damn uneccessary!
Chist, there it goes again.
Damn Ingvar!
- Take it easy.
- How can he be so idiotic?
You and Jan-Olov take this tree
away tomorrow morning.
And we'll take off these lights
so no more get broken.
I don't really think you see me!
- Listen, I see you very well.
- What do you see?
- You don't want to know.
- Yes... tell me.
You're still living here
and with your mother...
You don't even have
your own family or any children...
I see everything I don't want to be.
What if I can't have children?
Hey, shrimp? Damn...
When are you going to start hunting?
Tell it like it is...
You can't stand the sight of blood.
Unlike your father. I must say,
on the 10th anniversary of his death...
I'm impressed by him. Not everyone
dares to blow their brains out.
- Mia? Can you take this?
- Yes.
Come on, mum, let's dance.
I'd like a dance now!
- I can't go on.
- That's fine...
I can dance anyway.
Mum, you're lovely...
Your hair's lovely.
C-A-K-E...
Time for the cake!
- I want to light the candles.
- Has anyone seen Ingvar?
- Let him be...
- Easy for you to say.
- You don't know why he's carrying on.
- Yes I do...
- I found him sobbing in the toilet.
- What, is Ingvar unhappy?
Put in the candles and we won't talk
about this anymore.
- You know that man you danced with?
- Bjernulf?
He's married with three children.
Don't worry.
Gunilla already has a guy... on Bali.
- An American.
- You can't speak English!
That's what's amazing. I hardly
understood a word, but it didn't matter!
- So, you're moving there now?
- Are you crazy?
- Me? Speak for yourself.
- Just put in the candles...
You can go to hell, you damn...
...damn old witch...
Hello in the cottage!
But... What the hell...?
Go on... shoot...
Go ahead and shoot...
Then he should be shot
Then he should be shot
You shrimpy shrimp fucker...
Come on. Shoot...
Jesus, come on...! Aim up
so you don't mess up the walls.
You fucking amateur!
Go ahead and shoot!
Shoot!
We're having cake...
What are you doing? Hm?
What are you doing?
I don't belong here.
I'm like dad!
- I should be elsewhere. I'm like him.
- You're not like him.
- You're strong.
- I'm not strong, I'm just pityful.
- You're not pityful.
- It's a pity for us... men...
- I'm 37 and live at home.
- You don't live at home!
You have your own place. You live
here because you wanted to.
But it's crazy!
Sometimes one wants crazy things.
I can't even shoot myself.
At least dad dared to.
He dared to drop everything
and blow his brains out.
It was sad the world's so hard he had to
kill himself to show how bad it can be.
But he dared to... He...
He wasn't courageous!
He was so cowardly
he had to kill himself.
And that was just as well for him.
Because if he were here now-
- then I would kill him!
I wouldn't do it quickly.
No, I would draw it out so he could
really feel what it is to live!
And what it is to be dead!
Mum, what the hell...?
You cowardly, pitiful...
...pathetic person!
Who would rather destroy other
people's lives than deal with his own!
- What's he doing with the gun?
- Shit... Bloody Ingvar!
What the hell?
Didn't I tell you to go home?
Shrimp tried to blow his brains out!
I won't be sorry for you one minute
after what you've done to Jan-Olov!
And me?!
You didn't even dare talking about it!
You didn't dare share with me!
Even though I was there. What did
you think I became your wife for?
I'm so tired of going around feeling
sorry for you and holding you up!
When you've put it in your son's head
that the only way to solve anything-
- is to blow his head to bits!
- Barbro!
- Shut up!
And all of you...? I'm so damn tired
of hearing your moaning.
So tired of hearing your nonsense!
I'm so bloody tired
of seeing you lose one another!
Just because you are all
so damn stubborn!
You're not pityful, Jan-Olov.
Men are not pityful...
It's just a little easier to think so.
To feel sorry for someone.
Then you don't need to feel angry.
You can just feel sorrow.
Mum, I love you.
Just so you know...
Your sister is pregnant.
Congratulations!
Gunilla, it's not congratulations.
It's shit...
What does he say?
The dad?
There is no dad, there's...
There's a 19 year old with dreadlocks
who's a DJ in a hip-hop group.
Besides which he's the son
of my boss. And he won't be a dad.
- Are you going to have an abortion?
- Of course I'm having an abortion!
- Where are you going?
- To sleep. I'm leaving early tomorrow.
I see? So you're running away?
Mia, we have to try
and resolve this together.
Really?
Is clever Eivor going to help me now?
What an honour!
You've waited a long time for this.
Why do you think
I only want to hurt you?
I don't think you only want to hurt me.
- You aim to hurt Gunilla, too.
- How can you say that?
Of course I want things
to go well for you both.
So you mean to say that you
supported Gunilla in her divorce?
That you're happy that
a 32 year old backpacker in Bali-
- finally made her experience
really good sex?
Misled,
shafted and exploited her, you mean?
I'd love to get misled,
shafted and exploited-
- several time a year
if it's as nice as it was in Bali!
I'd like to get misled every day.
Mia, you should know that...
...it's actually not so easy for me.
Really, how can you say that?
You have everything! You have a
family, kids and someone to live with.
- I have nothing. Just myself.
- But you have us!
And you don't want anything!
You don't want a man.
You want nothing to do with us
and you don't want kids.
So, you're never prepared to invest.
And if you don't invest...
- You get nothing!
- It's actually not so easy.
You spoiled bloody brat!
Sure, I understand you drink alcohol,
throw up and take taxis.
But can you picture me at three
on a Wednesday morning-
- when I'm in a closet crying as
quietly as I can not to wake the family?
And my heart is thundering away,
because I'm panic stricken...
Because everything...
everything depends on me!
Getting mother to the doctor, calming
father because he's worried-
- about whether Gunilla is well.
Helping Barbro hang her curtains...
Nagging Tommy to clean the car. Tidy,
clean up... Unnoticed, undemanding...
- Just exist, exist, exist...!
- Just say no!
This is no bloody workplace where
you can come and go as you like!
- This... This is life!
- I like my work.
Why can't I just do that?
I'm happy in my apartment
and I'm happy in the city I live in.
Why can no other person live
in another way to you?
Just listen to yourself...
Me, me, me...! It's always your
dreams that must come true.
It's always been like that!
But do you know what...?
You have two parents here.
And they're starting to get old now.
And the day you have time for them,
they'll certainly be dead!
Just because you've dedicated
your life to caring for our parents-
- doesn't mean you can force us to!
I want to help,
but I have to do it in my way!
Only...
It's not so easy for me to come here
when you make me feel so worthless!
Mia...
Mia, I admire you.
I want to tell you that you are good.
But all...
All that comes
out are just strange...
...hard, nasty words. I...
I want to be close to you.
I want to be participate.
Eivor?
- Eivor...
- Eivor?
What is it? Go and fetch Tommy.
Fetch Tommy, hurry up!
Tommy!
Eivor's not well.
- I shot it! The cat!
- What do you mean, not well?
I shot that fucking cat!
Gunilla, hand me the frying pan.
How are we to bury her?
We don't know what she wanted.
Father, don't think about that now.
Did you put the potatoes on?
- What did she throw a party for?
- Father...
The doctor said
it had nothing to do with that.
Gunilla, get out the sausage.
We have to fry it.
And beetroots? Where are
the beetroots? We need those.
Take it easy, mother.
I'll get them out.
They have to have food. Gunilla, you
have to help Tommy with cleaning.
Yes, of course I will.
I'll make the mushroom pie
that Eivor really likes.
Yes, hello? Hello Kerstin.
It was... a heart attack.
We'll talk more another day. Bye.
I have to leave.
When are you going to the hospital?
Gunilla told me.
Tomorrow.
Is it...
Is it urgent?
Then maybe you can help me
make a mushroom pie?
- So, you're here?
- I was just fetching the lamp.
Have you thought about...
...what you're going
to do with the child?
I don't know, I...
I thought... I would
get in touch with him.
The guy...
More than that I don't know.
- Beside what Eivor would have thought.
- You never cared what she thought.
But it's just that... How can
you give up on someone so close?
Are you
starting to blame yourself now?
No, I just wonder
how one can be so clumsy.
- You had nothing in common.
- We had everything in common.
But she never did anything for you.
- But she tried, anyway.
- And so...?
Best to remember her as she was.
Stubborn... obstinate...
Envious...
So damn... She was difficult.
- She was annoying.
- She was so Dalecarlia.
Just that with the traditional outfit...
Like a little brat...
- I loved her.
- I loved her...
So much...
I didn't get to tell her.
- Are you leaving.
- Yes.
Listen...
I thought...
I don't think I see you so well.
I think I made up my mind
long ago as to who you were.
And you know it's hard to change
your mind when you've made it.
Strange how
everything happens at the same time.
I don't know what to think.
They called me this morning.
Asked me if I wanted
to go to Africa to drill wells.
Someone dropped out and...
...and they wondered if I wanted to go.
I'll be back in a year.
Call me if you want some more.
Do you hear? How silent it is?
