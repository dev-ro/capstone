Understand?!
What are you doing?
Don't know
Don't know? I've made it clear
Scatter, scatter
Help, help
You're smart, why are you so smart?
Don't go too close
Hey
Dead?
Yes, dead already
Sir
Sir
The Mission has been completed smoothly
Star Chow, where are your men?
All dead!?
We want a supervisor, we want team work
Not going alone like Rambo
The captives have been saved
Rescuing is just an item in this exam
What matters most
is the safety of your juniors
and your leadership
but I can't see anything!
Sir, give me a chance
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't!
Sir, could you please reconsider?
Who is it?
Yes
Yes, Sir. The boss wants to see you
Yes, Sir
Good morning Sir, I'm Star Chow
Damn it, that adorable!
Turn a round for me
don't be shy, come on!
Irresistible, I'm sorry
Wanna get a promotion?
I don't want to be a gigolo, Sir
I asked if you want a promotion
I won't be gigolo, Sir
That's nonsense!
I asked if you want a promotion
Yes
but not at the cost of my chastity
Who wants your chastity?
I want your youth
Youth and chastity
are equally important to me
Fine, fine, I see
Let me finish my words
One day
some students visited our police station
A pistol was lost afterwards
Sir, we lose pistols very often
But that pistol is mine!
I can share your heartbreaking feeling
Yes
that pistol's followed me for 30 years
I've never shot it
it's for scratching itches
Speaking of the itch and here comes
Scratch me
The back? Yes
It's a kind pistol
Can pistol be kind?
It's got a kind nature
if it falls in the hands of bad students
tragedies will follow
Don't worry, Sir
I'll search the whole school
for your pistol
If I can manage, I don't have to ask you
I'm retiring, but I've lost my pistol
I'll lose my face if others know
so I want you to enter that school
as a spy
I'm not sure if I can teach
Who ask you to teach? To be a student!
Student?
I joined the police force
because I hated studying
I can't be a student
Sir, if you do so...
you're bringing me to a volcano
with lots of wild animals
paying no attention to my wailing
and are just kicking me cruelly...
into the exploding volcano
How can you be so cruel?
You can live and die excitingly then
Stop, no way escaping
Here's a pager watch, put it on
666 means I call you
Say to me, good morning sir
Good... morning... sir
Very good
Don't let others know
or both you and I will be in trouble
I'll see
if you guys will be late again
What are you staring at?
You'll learn it by heart later
That's the new boy
Big stupid guy, from which class?
Could it be ours?
I don't think so
Star Chow, I'm the Head of Discipline
of this school. My name is Lam
A mosquito
You came from England College?
Students from that school are rubbish
I don't care what's between your family
and the school committee
Edinburgh College is a prestigious school
and teach the best students
I can't stand a single bad element
or I'll kick you out of here, clear?
Yes, Sir!
You think that's interesting?
Bring him to the classroom
Come with me to the classroom
Around 1987, an observation
from the sky above the South Pole...
revealed the ozone hole up above there
Strong ultraviolet ray
is harmful to living organisms
A less serious situation
will affect the genes
The worst case will kill the cells
Plants will die as a result
Ultraviolet ray
can penetrate into the sea
I lose freedom, my heart's breaking
my tears' flowing
I've lost my way and gone astray
My heart is breaking
Who's attacking the police
Attacking what?
You! Take the duster out
I don't care you're new in here
What are you dreaming? What?
Miss has got her pride
The lesson restarts!
Let's start with the atmosphere layer
The atmosphere
is made up of several layers
The layer nearest to the earth
is called the troposphere
It's 15,000 to 50,000 feet
above the earth
It contains cloud and weather systems
The Ming Dynasty
particularly stressed on punishment
Disrespect Party politics and espionage
were subjects to punishment
Turtle Wong
Mr. Cheng
what does it mean by espionage?
It's the current practice of spying
The people involved are called spies
These people are punished
by castration
Castration!?
Chopping sex organ, kid
Chopped by how many inches?
That depends on
how many inches you've got
The wrong book again, absent-minded!
Really absent-minded!
What's that noise?
Thank you for your help
Come and help me again
Come... Quicker...
Serve him right
You're laughing so happily
you come out too
Come...
What's your name?
Star Chow
And you?
Turtle Wong
What's your name?
Star Chow
What's yours?
Turtle Wong
What's your name?
Star Chow
Let's begin, Star Chow
This experiment is quite complicated
We must remember each step
Forgetting one single step
will be very dangerous
Sorry... the most important thing
of this experiment is...
Memory
If not it'll...
will be very dangerous
Stop!
Hey... get back down here
Hey, you, go away
Please could you get down here first
What are you doing? Who are you?
What's this to do with you
Excuse me and you get down
Why pulling me down here?
You're standing on my belly
Don't go away, we're on the same boat
we share the same code
Code!?
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon
What's the code?
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon
What's this? The code!
God! Everybody's abnormal here
Excuse me
You can't climb out from here
You can't walk out from here
OK, I'll use the front door
Not even with the front door
What's it?
Nothing, this boy's gone mad suddenly
Yes, I've gone mad. I want home
What is it?
Sorry, Sir
Don't block my way, please
Excuse me, please
Excuse me, I want to go
Are you alright?
I'm sick, I want to go home
Please let me go! Thank you
You're not feeling well
Yes
Come with me
Let's see if you've got a fever
No
Yes
No, look at it yourself
It's me who's got the fever
not the thermometer
I'm feeling so bad
Let me see your eyes
Look down
Look up
Look at the left
Hey, your eyeballs can't move?
It can't since I've got a fever
Pretending...
I'm Miss Ho, I'm not teaching your class
but I'm the counsellor of your class
You go back to classroom first
Come to me anytime
if you've got problem. Be good
Are you mad just because I've dropped
your pencil case unintentionally?
No, I ain't, ain't
I'm so frightened
So how much do you want?
That depends...
Only $300
I'm not frightened now
If I know you still got money with you
I'll not throw your pencil case away
but you!
I understood
Good, the saviour comes
Don't get it mistakenly
I'm not helping you guys
and I'm not your saviour
You can! You look so cheeky
They'll only bully you, not me
Thank you very much!
Sir, I remember the code
It's Dong Tong, Tong Dong Dong, right?
It's you? Yes
You should have said earlier
I forgot the code earlier
Sir, I'm CID5798
I'm sent here to cooperate with you
Go home
and have your hands stopped trembling
My hands are not trembling
It's the Parkinsonism
I'm only pretending
That saves me from doing a lot of work
The boss has asked you
to stay at my home
What kind of stick are you chewing?
To quit smoking
Hey... Miss Ho? Forget about her!
Her boyfriend
is the Head of Anti-triad Unit
What are you saying?
What?
I'm keeping an eye on that kid
who's smoking
You mean Johnny?
What is he?
The head of the 4 Tigers of Mount Parker
His big brother
Teddy Big is really somebody
He's the most suspicious in the case
which our boss lost his pistol
Keep an eye on him
Go!
Big brother
You asshole, what a lousy idea
Big brother
Now somebody's after us for money
It's fine to traffic drugs
why trafficking arms?
You said arms-trafficking
is profiteering during the Gulf War
You should have persuaded me
What are we going to do
with these AK47 s?
If we got pistols, we can rob
Johnny is here
Why didn't you tell me earlier
He's cheeky
Even you can be cheeky
if you've got money
You're here, come in
They're for Fung-shui
keep your hands off
I'm sorry
How are you getting on?
You're cheeky now
Don't worry, my dad's gone traveling
He won't have come back
even our cars reach Shenzhen
Let's see
and do pay us the money
for the 2 cars of my Brother back
I can only pay you
when my clients pay me
You're not that in need of money, right?
I need money badly
The money I collected in the school
can't even afford 2 nights in the Karaoke
I've got a great thing, wanna see?
It's great
we stole from the police academy
Cop's pistol?
3 each. Don't fight for it
In memory of your fathers?
Do I still need to work
if I've got so many fathers
They're all my ex-partners
Good, noodles...
Cook some for yourself
Come on, no...
Yes
Cook oneself is illegal
How many partners you've got?
9
But there're 10 here
I have to prepare one to two more...
one to two more...
and see who's coming to me
Maybe he needs it. Just keep as stock
Would you mind?
What are you saying?
You don't understand?
It's better if you don't understand
Die at an early age
Eat your noodles
I'll have supper outside
Remember to do your homework
you've to go school tomorrow
Fuck you No fucking
Nothing. Keep talking
You're always so dirty
I get used to it
I worked as a servant in a school
it's fine at first
but I have to work under Sir Chow
What an ass
What are you doing?
I'm less fortunate than you
I'm following the case of Teddy Big
Arms?
What a coincidence
we're also after Teddy Big
but for the pistol
Cop's pistol? Yes
Really?
They're in the machine gun business
Machine guns in HK?
Yes, goods have arrived
Wow...
Why don't you arrest them
The buyers are terrorists
Boss wants to arrest all at one go
That's tough!
It's life and death
if something goes wrong
We can't afford to alarm them
Well
keep an eye for the pistol for me as well
Sure Sure?
You have my word
Among the gang of underground informers
all are dead except you and me
Of course, I'll keep an eye for you
Everyone can die, except this
Lousy
Brother Teddy, stay calm
We'll settle if there's any problem
Remember Chicken Brand
whom you arrested 10 years ago
He wants to say hello to you
Inspector Wong
Policeman
Understand?
Yes, good
Understand?
Fuck
Stand on one foot, upper
A show over there
Watch only...
What?
I said watch only, don't laugh
Ha...
Are you alright?
Does it hurt?
You just didn't take my words to heart
This student is brainless
he's hopeless
Yes... always absent-minded
hopeless
He's a jerk already
looks as if he's sick
Never seen a 'star' like him
You 2 should be looking for the pistol
not looking up the dictionary
He couldn't hand in his homework today
and was punished
by not allowing to go back the classroom
You can look into the case
even if you're outside the classroom!
If I fail to hang in homework again
I'm out of the school
and I can't look into anything
Can you solve this calculation?
Let's see
I know nothing about trigonometry
When you first asked me
to handle this case
your attitude was different
No, he's always like this
I'm always like this
My soft words are
for cheating you to get involved
What about
asking some other cadets to come here...
and solve the Maths
You're an idiot! That means
disclosing the case to everybody?
Let me tell you
finish this case quickly
or I'll kick your brains out
with my Scissors Legs
What?
I'll fly over and kick you with legs
like scissors and kick your brain out
Scissors Legs, scared?
Very
Scissors Legs, what a joke
He was really gorgeous
he was!
He was able to deal with 20 guys alone
or only be able to shoot 20 planes!?
Dad, are you alright? Dad
Dad, go to hell, Dad
How can you say that!
Damn it! I'm late
It's only 6 o'clock
I'm influenced by your hard-work
I've to do a little revision
Yam...
I'm not called Yam
But you really look like
Have you finished your Biology?
Let me copy
I won't even if I have. Are you nuts?
I'll give you $50 in return
Mine?
You want money
before finishing the homework?
Stay away, one by one
as many as you want
Any compositions? Compositions
Keung, yours is torn, go away
He's quite popular Yes
Copy this late?
You're ruining your future. Hopeless
Look, I've finished
You think you're smart?
Of course
I'm not mocking you
I just want to say, from now on
I won't let anyone
throwing dusters at me
I won't be punished
by standing on the corridor
or standing in the playground
or holding a damn cardboard publicly
like a monkey. No!
Just keep copying...
Sudden test, those who fail
will be standing in the playground for a week
Mobile phone? Cool, isn't it?
What?
What? Chinese History test?
You 2 can handle
What? Boss, my Chinese History won't do
Hold on!
Mandy, ask all seniors to come up here
Ask them who's the one
suppressed the An-Shi Rebellion?
A - Kwok Chi, B for boy, is that clear?
Li Kwang Bud, C-Li Hark Yong
It's Li Hark Yong, not Lee Hac Ken
A is Kwok Chi Yee
B is Lee Kwang Bud
Which two of them are the heroes
Kwok Chi Yee and Chu Wen
It seems to be Lee Kwang Bud and Chu Wen
So who's the hero? Answer me!
Kwok Chi Yee or Chu Wen?
What? You look up the book?
No, I can manage... few more seconds
Son, it's Chu Wen. Who's Chu Wen?
The answer is B
Banana? B for banana
And ask them
What's the Ox-Li Party Conflict?
Find again? You even don't know this!
What have you studied? Shit!
Which big case are you in?
No idea
A for apple, that's it
Next question, listen carefully
The answer is D, D for dog
D for, D for dog
B
Uncle Tat, what are you doing here?
Well... collecting rubbish
The female toilet is blocked
can you do with that?
Come with me
What, the test is over
Sir, which case?
Sam Long
Dead already?
The case is re-judged
Stupid me, I should have guessed that
No
No again
You two are riding?
Falling
So you two are cheating
No, only me who's cheating. Arrest me
Come out with me
A moment please
He cheated in the Chinese History test
by copying the Chinese Literature book
You're dumb
That's not exactly cheating
I only want to let him
have the proper punishment
What do you say?
Deduct 3 marks from his conduct as usual
Stop it
Please don't. A deduction of 12 marks
will be out of this school
Miss Leung, what about you?
Kill him
What did you say?
That isn't what you want?
Just cheating
It's one of our experience
of growing up
Who hasn't cheated before?
But you even didn't use your brains
to cheat
Stand properly. Don't move!
You don't use your brains
you deserve it
I suggest arranging for another test
If he still doesn't learn from it
test him again and again
until he passes
That's punishing me
I can't afford the time
Save your time
from going to the race-course You
I agree
You can talk to his parents and
try to understand his family background
Fine, I've decided
He's punished by staying after school
for a week, clean the playground for two
Deduct 5 marks from his conduct
re-test next week
Also, I want to meet your parents
Parents? I don't have any
I've got no relatives, no friends
Who's your guardian?
I'm my own guardian
If there's anybody you want to see
It's me
His file
Who's his guardian in there?
Uncle Tat?
Uncle Tat!
Stop it, God... big news
Uncle Tat, is Star Chow really your son?
You're a senior to me, you say
Star Chow, say!
Don't laugh, say!
Yes
Yes... I'm sorry...
I bet, they look exactly the same
What? The same?
His dad? Nonsense
Hey, no... here
your surname's Tso
his is Chow, why?
How do I know? Why?
This is an order
When he's born, I named him Star Tso
but then he named himself Star Chow
I don't know why
Is this correct?
It's right
Sir, excuse us
Hold on, Uncle Tat
we want you to come up here to tell
your son cheated in a test
Cheated? That's disgraceful, no good...
You can't cheat
Sir, cheating... no good...
Excuse us
Hey, don't you see
parents and teachers
should cooperate to teach him
Right?
Teach him, for how long?
Your son's been here for only 3 days
and he cheated
Give me one or two slaps No...
You should teach him effectively
Don't be too serious
Of course, not to be too serious
Alright, I know what to do
You cheated?
I'll beat the hell out of you
Don't let him beat you
I'll beat you...
Dead already? Dead already
You're lying No
Again
You son-of...
Sir Chow, please
I have to use all my strength
to beat a strong man like you
Well...
I'm old and lacking of strength
After I beat you, my bones crack
Really? Yes
I'm sorry
Never mind, I'm in this business
Go and see the doctor, I'll pay for it
Thank you, thank you
Uncle Tat!
Miss Ho
Don't be so angry
Star Chow
do you know how great your father is?
Don't mention it, all parents are great
He can't go on like this
let me be his tutor
I've got no money to pay you
We can't owe you this favour, Miss
Uncle Tat! Dad
I won't take any money
No...
I'll lead him onto the right track
No...
No... not good
So let's start from tomorrow
Don't worry
Thank you, thank you
Thanks a lot
Save it, a golden opportunity for you
You said no to her, how dare you!
Be smart, don't reveal your identity
Hey
Somebody's looking for you
Who?
Go up and you'll know
OK. Coming
I must show him how smart I'm
He's coming
Who helps him just stand on his side
You want protection fee
I pay it for him
You Turtle must have no idea of death!
Let me take your mouth as an ashtray
Take him here
Anything else
Nothing
So don't call me up here
unless necessary
OK
Hopeless
Star, you're smarter than Bruce Lee
Star
do want to have your shoes cleaned?
Smart Star, have you got enough money?
I can give you
What's more, if you're not neat and tidy
I must beat you
Your hand. Show me your hand
I'm too old to be hit on the palm
Show me
Don't, no need, Miss
That one
I'll show you somewhere else to beat
If you are cruel enough
use all your strength to beat me
Like a garbage can
It's shameful if Miss Ho sees this
Hey, what's this? A toaster?
Throw the bread away
The blue magazines in your room
you have to...
Tidy up your room, stop eating
What? Let's play something
OK, tidy this place
To be Parkinsonism
Is Parkinson your dad?
Always so fond of this
I don't care how old you're
I tell you
The son shouldn't have a larger room
than his dad
Miss, I'm not sure about this
About what?
Please be seated, Star
your hair's been ruffled?
Legs should be straight
quicker, somersault
Yes... right...
You haven't put on your spectacles
You guys look so bored
Bored?
Let's ask Miss to take us out for a picnic
Bring your girl-friends along
With girls, we're fine
Great, Miss
Come on, help and light it
It can't be lit
Great...
You're too young to smoke
Throw it away!
I'll report to the police
You're ruining your future
Don't you smoke?
No, too expensive for me
Don't believe me? Smell my mouth
Are you silly?
Look, my teeth are clean
Well
are't you too young to have wisdom teeth
How old are you?
I'm... 18 years old
18?
Going on 19
But you look mature
Indeed, I'm ripe and ready to eat
All classmates have girl-friends
where's yours?
I don't have any
I'm against dating during study
It's a waste of time
You're cunning Right
Really? Really
I've seen your boy friend
He waits outside the school
How do you know he's my boy friend?
I can tell
He's quite good to you
You're nosy
but I think he's not my type
Right
you can't be reluctant to love somebody!
He's a cop. I hate cops
Me too, I don't like them much
What?
Annie, do me a favour
What?
Can I see your breast?
What?
One side will do
Breast!
You lose nothing!
What a lousy Turtle!
You're dirty-mouthed
Still here?
Turtle Wong does look like a turtle
Especially his head
With a shell, he looks exactly like a turtle
Turtle's result has dropped
I must give him some tutorials
But you're already my tutor
You still have time?
You've progressed
So let me be his tutor
I'm progressing
There should be no problem
Can you manage?
Yes, as long as you're my tutor
I can then manage to be his tutor
You see?
You see...
See?
This is my home, how's it?
Grandma, pour some tea
Brother Star, make yourself at home
Brother Star
which TV game you want to play?
PC or Nintendo?
Not now...
You're a nuisance. Pour some tea
Have some tea
Thanks, thanks
You guys are classmates?
Yes
Study together?
Yes
Classmates?
Yes...
You guys are classmates?
Yes, how do you know?
Stop it, you get back there
Stupid
Your Maria?
My Grandma
Grandma? Where're your parents?
They seldom come here
Brother Star, some great things for you
Wow... you've got a lot of great things
I'm coming here to be your tutor
Don't be silly
Grandma, try this
It's free. What's the harm of trying?
OK
Is it fun?
Try back hand, it's more interesting
Back hand and rush down at 90 degree
Hold, let the head go up first
Ready... go
Very good! Good shot
Try with both hands. It's stronger
Hit his head. There, right...
Wow... crueler than me
What about the Open Day?
You're responsible for the games
The theme of the games
is about fairy tales
Snow White and the seven dwarfs
What do you think...
Snow White and the seven dwarfs
are sleeping in the same bed
Seven guys, they've...
Enough. You're going too far
Miss, these may not be something we like
Why don't you ask our opinion?
Yes...
Ask Eleven
Eleven, what do you like to play?
Video games
The same for me
Right
Should we find something...
more interesting and exciting?
What about popguns?
Great...
Popgun is too violent
It's quite violent
but violence is better than porn
Have your supper...
Thanks
Stupid boy, why don't you give a hand?
What are you doing?
Enough. How can you behave like that?
Miss, have some soup
Have a piece of pork chop
Thanks. Uncle Tat
Dad, you try some
No need... What about you?
You got high score this time
Thank you Miss for giving me tutorials
But Turtle has higher score than you do
Really?
Look
Thanks to me who gives him tutorials
I instruct him to study everyday
Isn't it great
if every student behaves like you?
Well, it's even greater
if every Miss looks like you
There you go again
Scissors
Stone
Paper
I even couldn't hold her hand. Damn it
Where's my kid gone?
Grandma
I'm not coming home for dinner. See you
Mobile phone, cool
Brother Turtle, for this month
Today is the beginning of the month?
Yes, look after me
You should thank Brother Star
Be smart. Brother Star hates dumb guys
A waste of time
Brother Star loves this book
I treat this for next month
Brother Turtle, this is to thank you
Smart boy!
Something great to show you
Calling you, buddy
Why are you so thievish? Stay there
I can too
Brother Star
you're silly to find means doing so
You son-of-a-bitch
Go away
Open your mouth
Let me off, Brother Star
You keep running
despite my shouting at you?
I didn't mean it
What's your name?
Turtle Wong
Where do you live?
Kowloon Tong
The whole of Kowloon Tong?
Next to ldeal Hotel
Turn around
Hands on the head
Stop playing tricks
What's this?
Your phone
I know
So why did you ask?
Mind your manner to cop
What are these?
HK dollars
I know
So why did you ask?
Am I not qualified to ask you?
Am I not qualified?
You're qualified...
Tell me what are these?
HK dollars
I know
So why did you ask?
Son of a bitch, tell me
or I'll kick your brains out
with my Scissors Legs
Don't do that, Brother Star
the money is yours
What's that to do with me?
Protection fee
What protection fee?
I collect $30 from each classmate
We're the richest and most powerful gang
Most powerful gang?
Right, the Star Gang
Big brother
Listen, I'm not your big brother
Take your money back. Go at once
He's calling me, not you
Call him Grandpa
Grandpa
Good boy
Let's not turn our place into anarchy
or we both will be in trouble
I'm looking after you
Anybody gives troubles to you...
means giving trouble to me. Right?
Right
Want to get up a branch in my sphere?
We aren't Seven-eleven
Such an idiot! Know nothing
He's silly and knows nothing
Let me see how powerful he is
Sir Chow, Teddy Big arrives
Seems to come here for you. Watch out
Don't worry, it'll be fine
Grandpa, come over here
Don't call me Grandpa again, you guys
Brother Star
Teddy Big is coming to see you
Who wants to see me?
He said he wanted to see the head
That's you
That's you. You're the head recently
So what?
Hey, kid, stop
Are you the big brother?
How are you, brother?
So you're the head of the Star Gang
how cheeky
What did you say?
You didn't even inform me
when you set up a gang in my sphere
What's your rank?
I'm second in my family
I've got an elder sister
but she married a long time ago
She's trying to emigrate
How dare you
talk to my big brother like that?
Cops're coming
Kid, you're lucky
Watch your steps
you'll be less fortunate next time
What are you doing?
Are you still the tutor of Star Chow?
Yes
though his performance is not that great
but he's progressing a lot
Do you know
there's a new triad gang in your school?
Triads again? I've told you before
I won't tell you
my students' particulars
I'm not asking for that
I want to tell you
The new triad gang in your school
is called the Star Gang
The leader is your student, Star Chow
That's ridiculous. Listen!
He's my student
not a triad leader
But he's a bad element in the school
I say again:
no bad elements in my school
We're responsible
for leading students on to the right track
Fine, forget it
I don't want him to ruin our love
Can you stop being his tutor?
I'm your boy-friend, I worry about you
I teach students
to trust those around him
and you ask me not to trust my students?
Hi
Let's have our tutorial in the bedroom
because Dad's playing Mah-jong
and I don't want to disturb him
Are you alright, Miss?
Study in the bedroom
Alright
Having an affair?
What?
Have a walk outside
Walk to where?
To Guangzhou if you like
One for you, one for me
You're wrong
I'm right, yours is super thin
Really? Really
I'm not the type you think
and I'm not...
Hold it, she's a good girl
Don't ruin her, 15 minute will be enough
Go, stop bullshitting
Nuts
Damn! This is my home
and you asked me to go out
Are you father of Star Chow
Yes He said yes
Hey, what are you doing?
It's only a gum. Chewing gum
Start your lesson
You think I'm an idiot?
I'm disappointed in you
Help... help
Uncle Tat. What's up?
How are you?
Fine Uncle Tat
Stand aside
Stop it, give me a chance
Who asked you to come?
Teddy Big, please give me another chance
Give you another chance to do what
To go away
Where you wanna go?
I don't know
Go home and have a sleep
Your mom misses you
You're no wonder the no. 1 killer
in the SDU
That's only basic skill
Cops can't be as stupid as you
You're right
Dad, are you alright?
I'm fine, I'll rub some oil...
Let me rub... Good boy
Stop pretending
You're not a student
and you're not his father
We're indeed father and son
Though I look younger than him
he's my true son
Actually, I can't tell you this
but I don't want to lie to you
I'm a cop
Sir Chow, everything's settled
Do tell all
I'm a cop and
I'm in the school to look into a case
but I really want to help the kids
I don't care and don't wanna know
what's between you
but please stop fooling me, Sir Chow
What are you doing?
Don't tell the others, OK?
Don't
Will she tell the others?
She will, you go and kill her
Yes, Sir!
Save your dirty words
I should kill you first, save yourself!
OK...
Have I spent too much?
Do you believe I'll smash your head
I do
That's wonderful
Yes...
You've been in the school for 2 months
and you've found nothing
What have you done?
Tell me
My way is like this
First I have to communicate
with the students and teachers
Yes, culturing a relationship
No matter what
find out that pistol within a month
or both of you will be fired
I don't care, I was born cheap
I'm not ambitious
I'll send you to work along the border
Great... thanks a lot!
Don't be so rash
You scared us by your hand which can smash
Yes, we're scared
Keep that smashing hand away
We're scared enough
The students will do a good job
in the Open Day
Fine, last year was boring
Alright
Can you lend me your pager?
What's for? Lend it to me
The pager is mine...
Lend it to me
The pager is...
I know, I'll return it to you afterwards
Thanks
If not for you
I wouldn't have scored 80 in Geography
If not for you
the kids wouldn't have listened to me
For you told me
the goal of life shouldn't be for oneself
Now I tell you my goal in life is you
Sorry for having lied to you in the past
Sorry because I'll always follow you
Star Chow
Hi
Foolish! I'll keep the pager
Hey, the pager is mine
You block my way
Hey, the pager is mine
Why are you standing here?
You're blocking my way by standing here
But the pager is mine...
Can you excuse me
Somebody's chasing after you, run!
Turtle, go away
Many against one?
Sir, shall we start?
Know the situation first
Don't go
Damn!
Brother Star is in trouble
Help him
Let's start
The cops, run away, the cops
Brother Star, are you alright?
I'm fine, fine
Sir
the fighting is in full swing over there
What?
Report to us in the police station
How are you? Are you alright?
I think I'm fine
Take a rest
Are you two alright?
Alright
Have you seen Star Chow?
No
No, go back and take a rest
Have you seen Star Chow?
No, Miss
Talk everything to my lawyer
Turtle
Miss, it hurts!
Have you seen Star Chow?
No, I don't know where they've taken him
Have you seen Sir Wong?
Sir Wong... he...
Hey
You're not obliged to say anything
but whatever you say
may be used as an evidence
I have the right to call my lawyer
and to have some tea
but you've got no right to hang me up
It stinks Hands off
Wanna beat my sole?
Take me for a new comer?
Good, come. Beat my head instead
Let's see who gets the trouble, come on
Right
I can beat you this time
Miss Ho, you can't go inside
Hey
Are you alright? What are you doing?
Beating your own man? Actually...
Why are you here?
Crazy! Beat your man
I've got something important to tell you
Let me finish. Actually he's a...
Stop it
Star, are you alright?
Ask if his hand is alright
Go back and rub some oil
or your bones will crack
Are you leaving?
They beat anybody no matter what. Go...
It's fine now, go
You've made a mess
instead of looking for the pistol
You'll never get a promotion
Maybe you don't want promotion, too
Go away, get back to square one
Give me one more chance Chance?
I've given you chances
Still ask for more?
Didn't I give you any chance?
I didn't say that
We'll die together
if you can't find the pistol
Real Scissors Legs!?
No need to be that happy
Very funny
When is your birthday?
December 22, a party for me?
No, Mine is January 4
Remember my name is Tso Tat Wah
No, this time it's either you or me
There should be one who writes something
on the grave for the other
Can you make it more explicit?
The arms?
I knew where Teddy Big put his arms
Why didn't you say earlier?
I'm scared, big brother
Call me Sir
Attention
Yes, Sir
Do you know
the consequence of not telling the truth?
Yes, Sir
So why didn't you tell?
Afraid, Sir I'm afraid too
But we're the cops and must do our best
Sorry, Sir
You wanna be a spy forever?
Yes
What?
It's interesting
I'll accompany you when you die
Stand straight and look at me
Kiss you
Son of a bitch
It's this car park
It's here Which car?
How do I know? So?
Look into every car
You're stupid
What?
Some noise outside
Go out and have a look
Go in and have a look
Anything?
Nothing
So what's the noise?
Check around
Great
They're all long guns
This one is short. This's cop's pistol
This one...
What are you doing?
Bring them all to the police station
The car will carry them. Put them down
Finished? Finished
I haven't got into the car
I'm here... hey...
I haven't got into the car
Excuse me, what problem?
Everything under control
Don't worry, OK?
Time to pee...
I'll show you something great afterwards
You call me this early
please show me something great
Of course something great
Something great?
Keep it
I've never thought it'd be back
smart boy
Stop crying. More to come More?
Wake up, hey
Wow... where did you find it?
It's really great before my retirement
You can be the governor
if you don't retire
Wait a few more seconds
Smart Star Chow, you've moved my arms?
Wanna hear your dad's voice?
Kid. I'm fine so far, but...
Listen, if you wanna see your dad
meet me at the back of the school
in half an hour
Remember, no tricks
Hey, the foreigner's getting impatient
for waiting half day
I'm calling him. Be more patient
Ask him to shut up
He'll see the guns in half an hour
Why are you so nervous?
The guns are with me
Call the SDU if necessary
They can manage
Then Uncle Tat will be more dangerous
Remember he's a cop and a spy
He knows. He's old to suffer
Hey, I know what you wanna do
wanna show off again?
Don't. I'd rather kill you myself
than letting others kill you
Hey. This is a kind pistol
Don't. It hasn't been used
for more than 30 years
Don't take it away
What you doing? Driving away?
Drive if you have the guts
Don't come back if you have the guts
Young guys nowadays are so brave
Where are the guns?
Release my dad
Follow me...
Star, I haven't...
Go ahead
What smell?
Burn the banknotes...
It can't be fired! Isn't it too kind?
Go away!
Catch him!
Why coming back to school?
Wanna kill your classmates?
Today is a public holiday
Shit, nobody's there to help
Higher. Hey... what are you playing?
Stop...
What? Popgun again? Give us a hand
Hold it, help me
You should help too. Hurry
What happened to Brother Star?
He said he'd help
He still hasn't showed up
Brother Star must have been arrested
by police
You're silly. Miss Ho's seen him
Really?
Miss Ho! Is brother Star alright?
Alright
I'm right. Stop bullshitting
You look dull. Are you alright?
I'm fine
So many people here
Why are you here? Today's holiday
Go away. It's dangerous
Go quickly
Uncle Tat can run that fast
Come closer Wait
Damn it
Have you seen Star Chow?
No Inside
Why looking for him?
None of your business!
Stay away
Keep an eye on the students. Come here!
That way
Hey... what do you want?
None of your business
Don't make a sound
Babe, are you scared?
Then you won't be scared
Finished
Miss Leung, call the police
Hurry
Let's go and save Brother Star
Don't. They've got pistols
I've got one too
Don't go...
What are you doing? Wanna die?
Follow me
Hey, wait Quick
Let's go
That's the entrance, genius
How do I know?
Every door looks the same
So you have to follow me. Stupid
Here we're
Call the boss right away
What about you?
A lot of kids are there
I must go back
But the pistol can't work
I can manage
No, I must stay and help you
Seek helpers!
You're too old to help
Hey...
Have you seen him?
No
You go that way. The rest follows me
Turn left
Left again, left
Hands up. Don't move
I've asked you not to move
Go... quickly
Kin's shot. Take him away
Quickly. Damn it
Go, wanna die?
Go... that way... that way
Go... you kid
Squat! Squat down!
That way, go
Quicker I'll kill you with a shot
Move!
No again? You didn't leave me one?
You're cruel to me
Brother Star Brother Star
Star Chow. Listen!
the kids are in my hands
I'll give you 5 minutes
If you don't come out
I'll kill them all
Brother Star, they mean it
Stop it... Don't make sound
Stay calm. Do you hear me?
What are you best at doing?
We'll die this time
Fuck you. Shut up!
Listen. What are you best at doing?
Flirting
What's besides flirting?
Nothing
You're best at having fun
You flirt because you want to have fun
not because you want to marry
OK, let's have fun with them
and try to play a game
but we can't lose this game
or somebody will die
Have you played such an exciting game?
No
But we'll by no means lose
All we have to do is to cooperate
I'm the supervisor
and you two listen to me
We are in a favourable situation
We'll win. Must be confident
Are you confident?
Yes... Good! Start!
Six of them
Give me any weapons
Popgun
Not popgun. I said no popguns
This is a real gun with 5 bullets
Only 5 bullets?
Star Chow, come out quickly
Let's gamble. Mark the time
Good. Do as we planned, clear?
Star Chow, come out!
You think I'm kidding?
You hear me?
I'll kill them one by one
20 seconds left
Come out!
Come out... or I'll kill them one by one
Come out or I'll blow their brains off
Do you believe me?
So you don't believe me. Good
Run... quickly
Fire... fire if you have the guts
I'm afraid you don't have the guts
He's the first to die
Go ahead. That's none of my business
Wanna cover you? You'll be shot anyway
You know what will happen. Come
You think I'll be scared?
I can kill you with only one shot
Fire...
I will. Go ahead
I count 3 and let's fire together
1 ,2,3... OK, sorry
It's my fault, sorry
You're no match for me
Why taking this so seriously?
Guns down
Go back...
Where's the money?
Not with me
Where's the money?
Here's the money
Put the pistol down!
Do you dare?
or I'll burn all the banknotes
and we'll all have troubles
Got a lighter?
You don't have any?
No, how about you?
No
Brother Teddy
can I borrow your lighter?
You asked for it!
Big Brother... watch out, go quickly
So cool!
How dare you firing back at me?
Come out at once!
Wanna kill me? Come out...
Don't fire!
Guns down!
Boss
Bingo!
Kid
I'm not the leader of the Star Gang
I'm one of the Royal HK Police Force
also known as Scissors Legs
Remember that!
Boss
You'll leave scars on my pistol
if you throw it
I have no choice...
Your pistol can't work!
I've told you this is a kind pistol
You wanna use it to kill?
How dare you?
but you're also smart
to shot him quite accurately
and maintain the police's reputation
School of Police hasn't taught me this
I learnt it in this school
The men're coming. I'm leaving
Don't tell them I've been here
Thanks for arresting him
Chief Inspector Chow
What? Chief Inspector?
When I say you are, you are
Shouldn't I be the Chief Superintendent?
Brother Star
Do come and have tea some time
Pass this mobile to you, do call me
I'll call back right after it rings
Take care Take care
Brother Star, how lucky you are!
Yes...
What are you waiting for!?
