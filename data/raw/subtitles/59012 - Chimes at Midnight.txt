The days that we have seen!
Do you remember since we lay
all night in the windmill...
...in St. George's field?
No more of that,
Master Shallow.
Ah! it was a merry night!
And is Jane Nightwork alive?
l think so.
-Doth she hold her own well?
-Old.
-Old, Master Shallow.
-Nay, certain she is old.
She must be old.
She had a child before
l came to...
...St. Clement's inn.
Jesu, the days that we
have seen!
Sir John, said l well?
We have heard the chimes at
midnight, Master Robert Shallow.
That we have! That we have!
That we have! That we have!
Jesu, the days that we
have seen!
''King Richard ll, was murdered
on behalf of the Duke...
...Henry Bollingbroke, say some,
at the castle of...
...Pontefract, on 14th February,
of the year 1400.
Before his death, the
Duke had been crowned.
And Edmund Mortimer, the
true heir to the throne,...
...was a prisoner of the
Welsh rebels.
The new king was in no hurry
to pay for his ransom,...
...and to prove this, Mortimer's
cousins, the Percys,...
...set off to Windsor,
to see the King.
Northumberland,...
...his son, Henry Percy,
surnamed ''Hotspur'',...
...and Worcester, whose idea,
was always to act maliciously,...
...and to plot against them.''
Shall we buy treason?
-My lord...
-No, let him starve.
For l shall never hold that man
my friend...
...whose tongue shall ask me to
ransom home revolted Mortimer!
Revolted? He never did fall off
my lord's liege, but by war.
Till now, l have remain'd cold
blooded before these iniquities,...
...but, l tell thee, l shan't remain
thus much longer a time.
Our family, my lord,...
...deserves not the harshness
of your rage,...
...for thou art support'd, by our
greatness and our weapons...
-...to be seated on this throne.
-Worcester, leave us, l say!
For your eyes, speak of plots,
resentment and obedience not.
-Lord...
-What else?
Let me not hear you speak of
Mortimer, or you shall hear in...
...such a kind from me as
will displease you.
-Hear me, my lord.
-Lord Northumberland,...
...we license you depart with...
...your son.
Speak of Mortimer! Zounds l will
speak of him, and let my soul...
-...want mercy if l join him not.
-Nephew, pray listen to me.
Did King Richard then proclaim
my brother Edmund Mortimer...
-...heir to the crown?
-He did, myself did hear it.
Nay, then l can not blame his
cousin, that wish'd him starve.
Shall it, for shame, be spoken in
these days, or fill up chronicle...
...in time to come, that men of
your nobility and power,...
...did gage them both in an
unjust behalf?
God pardon it!
To put down Richard,
that sweet, lovely rose...
...and plant this thorn,
this canker, Bollingbroke.
-Say no more.
-By heavens, me thinks it were...
...an easy leap to dive into the
bottom of the deep, where...
...fathom-line could never touch
the ground and pluck up...
...drown'd honour by the locks,
than to bear so vile a king!
Farewell, l'll talk to you when
you are better temper'd to attend.
Leave not! What can l do if
nettled and stung with pismires...
...l get, when l hear of
this vile polititian, Bollingbroke?
ln Richard's time, what do ye
call the place, where l first...
...bow'd my knee unto this king
of smiles, this Bollingbroke?
When you and he came back
from Ravenspurg!
You say true.
What a candy deal of courtesy
this greyhoud then did proffer!
And, gentle Harry Percy,
my kind cousin.
-O, the devil take such cozeners.
-Say no more, let us be wise.
God forgive me, good uncle, tell
your tale, for l have done.
-Nay, if you have not, to't again.
-l have done already.
Secretly into the bossom creep
of that some noble prelate, well...
-...belov'd, the archbishop.
-Of York, it's not?
Good blow against the king!
And then the power of Scotland...
...and of York to join with
Mortimer, ha?
And so they shall. Farewell, good
brother, no further go in this.
-l by letter shall direct you.
-We shall thrive, l trust.
One thing l shall do, pursue
and fight that Bollingbroke!
And that some sword-and-
buckler Prince of Wales,...
...he, who cares not that his
father loves him not.
l'd have him poison'd with
a pot of ale.
-And Falstaff?
-Fast asleep.
And snorting like a horse.
-l have taken his purse.
-And what hast thou found?
Nothing but papers, my lord.
-What time of day is it, lad?
-What a devil hast thou to do...
...with the time of the day?
Unless hours were cups of sack...
...and minutes capons, and cocks
the tongue of bawds, and dials...
...the sign of leaping houses, and
blessed sun himself a fair hot...
...wench in flame-coloured
taffeta.
l see no reason why thou hast
to knowthe time of day.
lndeed, Hal.
For we that take
purses, go by the moon.
Who the devil hast robbed me?
Hostess!
Hostess!
-What dost want thou?
-My pocket was picked!
Why, Sir John, what do you think
that l keep thieves in my house?
-Leave!, l knowthee, even now!
-l know you, Sir John!
You owe me money, and now you
pick a quarrel to belique me of it.
This house's turned
bawdy-house.
-A bawdy-house sayest thee?
-Yea, and they pick pockets!
But for having 12 or 14 maidens
who live honestly,...
...by sewing, thou sayest l own
a bawdy-house. What a world!
Canst one sleep fearing not for
the fate of one's purse?
Sir John, you owe money here!
What didst thou lose, Jack?
-'Tis no trifle offence, some' 40.
-What sayest thou?
And a seal ring of my
grandfather's, worth 40 mark.
You owe so much money, Jack,
you hath forgotten.
1st: a capon, 2s. 2d.
Sauce, 4p.
Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8p.
Anchovies and sack after
supper, 2s. 6d.
-Bread, 0s. 1/2 d.
-O monstrous!
Come, don't burden me
with thou ill mood.
l forgive thee.
l'll have some sack!
God forgive thee for it.
Before l knewthee, l knew
nothing, and now am l,...
lf a man should speak truly,
little better than of the wicked.
l was as virtuously given as a
gentleman need to be, enough.
Swore little, diced not above
seven times a week, went to...
...a bawdy-house not above
once in a quarter...of an hour.
Company, villanous company
hath been the spoil of me.
An l have not forgotten what
the inside of a church is made...
...of, l am a pepper-corn,
a brower's horse, a church!
Well, l repent.
-Where shall we take a purse?
-Where thou wilt, Ned.
l see a good amendement in thee,
from praying to purse-taking.
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, 'tis
no sin for a man to labour in it.
My lads, to-morrow morning,
early, at Gadshill,...
...there are pilgrims going to
Canterbury, with rich offerings...
..and traders riding to London
with fat purses.
-Hal, wilt thou make one?
-Who, l rob? Not l, by my faith!
There's neither honesty, manhood
nor good fellowship in thee.
Nor thou comest not of the
blood royal, if thou darest not...
-...stand for 10 shillings.
-lt likes me not to go.
l'll be a traitor, then, when
thou art king.
l care not.
My lord, l have a jest to
execute, that l cannot do alone.
My dear prince!
Come, dost brood not over it!
l'll go with thee.
A booty shalt it be for all!
Provide us all things necessary.
Farewell, my lord.
-Farewell.
-Hal...
...when thou art king, let
not us be called...
...thieves of the day's beauty,
let us be Diana's foresters,...
...gentlemen of the shade.
Let men say, we be men...
...of good government, being
governed, as the sea is...
...by the moon, whose
countenance we steal.
l knowthee well,
l wilt join you in thy...
...errands for a while.
l would l be the sun, who
lets horrid clouds, hide...
...away its beauty, until
he wantest to show it in all...
...its splendour and grandeur,
being thus more admired,...
...for it hast taken
a longer time to show itself.
lf all the year, a holiday it were,
pleasure woulst become as...
...tiresome as duty, but as holidays
be few, we long for them ..
That day when l fail to
live a rash life, to pay a debt...
...that was never mine own, the
surprise of them, my subjects...
...wilt be greater, my amendment
in life so sudden, that it shalt...
...be all the more admired
and reckon'd.
My amendment, after my
sins, shalt be more worthy.
But, shall there be gallons
in England when thou art king?
Do not thou, when thou art
king, hang a thief.
No, thou shalt. Thou shalt
become a brave hangman.
''The purpose you undertake
is dangerous.''
That's certain, 'tis dangerous to
take a cold, to sleep, to drink...!
-Henry...
-l tell thee, you vile coward...
...out of this nettle, danger,
we pluck this flower safely.
-Henry...
-''The purpose is dangerous...
...the friends you hath named
uncertain, the time itself...
...unsorted, and all your whole
plot too light.''
Say you so, say you so?
l say unto you again, you are a
shallow cowardly hind!
By the Lord! Our plot
is a good plot...
...as ever was laid.
A good plot with true and
constant friends.
-Goeth you.
-Must l leave you, Kate,...
...what a frosty-spirited
rogue this is!
ln respect of the love he bears
our house, he shows in this.
He loves his own barn better
than he loves our house!
Hath Butler brought those
horses from the sheriff?
What horse, my lord?
A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
That roan shall be my throne!
-What letters hast thou there?
-From thy father.
-Why comes he not himself?
-He's grievous sick.
How has he the leisure to be
sick in such a justling time?
You shall see now, in very sincerity
of fear and cold heart,...
...will he to the king, and lay
open all proceedings.
Hang him...!
For what offence have l this
fortnight been a banish'd...
...woman from my Harry's bed?
ln thy faint slumbers l, by thee
have watch'd and heard thee...
...murmur tales of iron wars,
speak terms of manage to thy...
...bounding steed;
Courage, to the field!
And thou hast talk'd of sallies
and retics, of trenches, tents...
...of palisadoes, cannon, culverin,
of soldiers slain, ransom and fight.
Yea, fights!
But hear you, my lord.
-My lord!
-What say'st thou, my lady?
-What is it, carries you away?
-Why, my horse, my love.
ln faith, l'll know your business!
But if you go...
So far a foot, l shall be
weary, love.
ln faith l'll break thy finger,
an if thou wilt not tell me...
-...all things true.
-Away, you triffler!
Love? l love thee not.
l care not for thee.
This is no time to kiss, but for
bloody noses and crack'd crowns.
Gods me, my horse!
Do you not love me?
Do you not, indeed?
Nay, tell me if you speak in
jest, or no.
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
And when l am o'horseback...
...l'll swear
l love thee infinitely!
l know you wise, but yet
no further wise...
...than Harry Percy's wife.
Constant you are, but...
...yet a woman.
And for secrecy no lady closer
for l well believe, that thou...
...wilt not utter what thou
dost not know,...
...and so far will l trust thee,
gentle Kate.
-How! So far?
-Not an inch further.
Wither l go, thither shall
you go too.
-Will this content you?
-lt must, of force.
How long it's ago, Jack, since
thou sawest thine own knee?
My...own knee?
When l was about thy years, l
was not an eagle's talon in the...
...waist, a plague of sighing
and grief it blows a man up.
-Here comes the king's money.
-'Tis going to his exchequer.
-My friends, the purpose is clear.
-Halt!
-You four shall front them.
-How many be there of them?
-Some eight or ten.
-Zounds, will they not rob us?
Give me my horse.
To thy tasks.
lf they shalt escape your attack,
they shalt fall unto our trap.
8 yards of uneven ground is 70
miles a foot with me.
l have removed his horse.
lf l travel further, l shall
break my wind.
l'll starve, are l'll rob
a foot further!
Whew! A plague upon you all!
Lie down!
Lie down, close to the ground,
and list if thou canst hear...
...the tread of travellers.
Have you any levers to lift
me up again?
They art coming.
l pr'ythee, good prince Hal, help
me to my horse, good king's son.
Shall l be your ostler?
Go hang thyself in thine own
heir apparent garters!
Come on!
Come, the boy shall lead our
horses down the hill;...
...we'll walk a-foot awhile,
and ease our legs.
Cut the villains' throats!
-For obtaining of suits?
-Here.
Life hast been made for
the young, old fool!
Come, come.
Come, my masters, let us share.
An the prince and Ned be not
two cowards, there's no equity...
...stirring. There's no more value
in that, than in a wild duck.
Your money villains!
The thieves are scatter'd, and
possess'd with fear!
Each takes his fellow
for an officer.
Falstaff sweats to death, and
lards the earth as he walks.
We're not for laughing,
l should pity him.
None knowest the faring of
mine strayed son, Harry?
-l hath seen him not for months.
-My lord.
-Did thou read the letters l sent?
-Yes, my lord.
Our kingdom is sick, a serious
disease spreads over it.
Percy and Lord art supported by
50,000 men, they say.
Here comes Lord Rham.
Lord Northumberland is sick,
but a great army of...
...Englishmen and Scots,
follows Henry Percy.
My pride be wounded by envy.
l envy that Lord Northumberland
should be the father...
...to so blest a son.
The very straightest plant.
Whilst l, by looking on the
praise of him, see riot and...
...dishonour stain the brow of
my young Harry.
O that it could be prove'd that
some night-tripping fairy had...
...exchang'd in craddle-clothes
our children, where they lay,...
...then l would have his Harry,
and he mine.
-Where is the Prince of Wales?
-We know not, my lord.
Pray God they find him soom!
Ask in London, search the inns...
...they say he visits the
taverns,...
...with shady characters,...
...who hidest in alleys to
attack some...
...wardens, they pick-pocket
our subjects.
My son, who is an
affeminate fool,...
...wantest to bet his honour
by pervenrting that vile crowd.
Easy victory!
The virtue of this jest will
be the incomprehensible lies...
...that this same fat rogue
will tell us.
How30, at least, he fought with
what wards, what blows,...
...what extremities
he endured to defeat them all.
A plague of all cowards!
A plague of all cowards!
l say, and a vengeance too!
Give me a cup of sack, boy.
-Where hast thou been, Jack?
-A plague of all cowards!
Go thy ways, old Jack,
die when thou wilt.
lf manhood be not forgot upon
the face of the earth,...
...then l am a shotten herring.
There live not three good men
unhanged in England,...
...and one of them is fat and
grows old; God help the wicked!
What mutter you, woolsack?
A king's son!
lf l do not beat thee out of thy
kingdom with a dagger of lath,...
...and drive all the subjets afore
thee like a flock of wild geese,...
...l'll never wear hair on my
face any more. Prince of Wales.
-Why, you whoreson round man.
-Vile fat man!
What's the matter?
Are you not a coward? Answer.
And ye call me a coward?
Ye fat paunch!
Dost l call thee coward?
l'll see damned ere l call you
coward, but l would give...
...a thousand pound, l could run
as fast as thou canst.
What's the matter?
There be four of us here have
ta'en a thousand pound this day?
-A thousand, where is it?
-Where is it, Jack?
Where? Taken from us it is.
-A hundred upon poor four of us.
-What, a hundred, man?
lf l were not at half-sword
with a dozen...
...of them two hours together,
l have'scaped by miracle.
l am eight times
thrust through the doublet,...
...my buckler cut through, my
sword hacked like a hand-saw.
-How was it?
-We four set upon some dozen!
Sixteen at least.
And bound them, we were
sharing, 6 or 7 men set upon us.
-What, fought ye them all?
-lf l fought not with fifty of...
...them, l am a bunch of radish.
lf there were not upon...
...poor Jack, then l am no
two-legged creature.
Pray God, you have not
murdered some of them.
Nay, that's past praying for.
l have peppered two of them,
two l am sure l have paid.
Two rogues in buckram suits, if
l tell thee a lie, Hal, spit in...
...my face, and call me horse.
l acted a true man.
Four rogues in buckram
let drive at me.
-What, four?
-Thou saidst but two even now.
Four, Hal, l told thee four.
These four came all a-front.
l made no more ado but took all
their seven points in my target...
-...thus!
-Seven?
Why, there were but four...
-ln buckram suits?
-Ay, in dark buckram suits.
Seven, by these hilts or l am
a villain else.
Let him alone, we shall
have more anon.
-Dost thou hear me, Hal?
-Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
Do so, for it is worth
listening to.
-These nine l told thee of,...
-So, two more already.
...began to give me ground, but
l came in foot and hand...
...and with a thought,...
-...seven of the eleven...l paid.
-They are eleven now.
But as the devil would have...
...it three misbegotten knaves
in green, came at my back...
...and let drive at me.
For it was so dark, Hal, that...
-...thou couldst not see thy hand.
-These lies are like...
...the father that begett'd them.
Why, thou clay-brained guts,...
...thou non patted fool,
thou whoreson...
-...obscene, swine...
-What, art thou mad?
-ls not the truth, the truth?
-Why, how couldst thou know...
...this men in green, when it was
so dark thou couldst not see?
-Come, tell us your reason.
-Come, your reason, Jack.
What, upon compulsion?
No, were l at the strappado.
l would not tell you on
compulsion.
l'll be no longer guilty of this
sin, this sanguine coward.
This horse back-breaker, this
huge hill of flesh!
Away you, starveling!
You elf-skin,...
...you dried neat's tongue!
O for breathe to utter
what is like thee!
You tailor's yard, you seath,
you bow-case, you vile stuck!
Well, breathe awhile, and
then to it again.
We two saw you four
set on four;...
...mark now, how a plain tale
shall put you down.
Falstaff, you carried your
guts away as nimbly and still...
...ran and roared, as ever
l heard a bull-calf.
What a slave art thou to hack
sword as tho hast done,...
...and say it was in fight. What
trick canst thou now find out...
-...to hide thee, from this shame?
-Jack, what trick hast thou now?
By the Lord, l knew ye as well
as he that made ye.
Was it for me to kill
the heir apparent?
Why, thou knowest l am as
valiant as Hercules, but...
...beware instinct. The lion will
not touch the true prince.
l was a coward on instinct.
-l am glad you have the money.
-My lord, my prince!
Marry, my lord, there is a noble
man would speak with you.
What's the matter?
He comes on behalf of thy father.
Give him as much as thee canst,
and send him back to my mother.
-What manner of man is he?
-An old man.
What doth gravity out of his
bed at midnight?
-Shall l give him answer?
-Pr'ythee, do, Ned.
Lock the doors, keep vigil
to-day and pray to-morrow,...
...lads, dost you want to enjoy?
-Lets put up a comedy.
-A comedy?
Thou wilt be horribly chid
tomorrow when thou comes to...
...thy father, if you love him,
practise an answer.
-Do thou stand for my father.
-Shall l? Content.
This chair shall be my state,
and this cushion...my crown.
Twas Sir Thomas Gracey.
Bad news, they sayest...
-...that Hotspur of the North...
-Percy.
He that kills me some six or
seven dozen Scots at a breakfast...
...and says to his wife. Fie upon
this quiet life! l want work.
Couldst anyone more fear'd
be though off?
Doth not thy blood thrill?
Art thou not horribly afraid?
Not a whit, i'faith, l lack
some of thy instinct.
Give me a cup of sack to make
mine eyes look red...
...that it may be thought l have
wept, for l must speak in passion.
Harry...
...l do not only marvel where
thou spendest thy time,...
...but also howthou art
accompanied.
He doth it as like one of these
harlotry players as ever l see!
Quiet, hostess!
That thou art my son, l have...
...partly thy mother's word,
partly my own opinion...
...but chiefly a villanous trick
of thine eye, and a foolish...
...hanging of thy nether lip.
Why, being son to me,...
...art thou so pointed at?
There is a thing, which thou
hast often heard of,...
...the pitch, doth defile, so doth
the company thou keepest.
And yet, there is a virtuous
man whom l have often noted...
...in thy company,
l know not his name.
What manner of man...?
A goodly portly man, and a
corpulent, of a cheerful look...
...a pleasing eye and a most
noble carriage.
As l think his age,
some 50 or 60,...
...and now l remember me,
his name is...
Falstaff.
lf that man should be lewdly
given, he deceiveth me,...
...for l see virtue in his looks,
him keep with...
-...the rest banish.
-Dost thou speak like a king?
Do thou stand for me,
and l'll play my father.
Depose me?
-Well, here l am set.
-And here l stand.
-Harry, whence come you?
-My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
The complaints l hear of
thee are grievous.
They are false. l'll trickle
ye for a young prince, i'faith.
There is a devil haunts thee, in
the likeness of a fat old man...
...a tun of man is thy
companion.
Why dost thou converse with
that trunk of humours,...
...that bolting-hutch of
beastliness,...
...that huge bombard of sack,...
...that stuffed cloak-bag of guts,
that ox that reverend vice,...
...that father ruffian,
that vanity in years?
Wherein is he good?
But to taste sack and drink it!
Wherein is he useful?
But to carve a capon and eat it.
Wherein cunning, but in craft?
Wherein crafty, but in villany?
Wherein villanous,
but in all things?
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?
Whom means Your Grace?
That villanous abominable
misleader of youth.
That old white beard Satan.
-My lord, the man l know.
-l knowthou dost.
But to say l know more harm
in him than in myself, is a lie.
That he is old, his white
hairs do witness it.
But that he is, saving your
reverence, an old Satan,...
...that, l utterly deny!
lf sack and sugar be a fault,
God help the wicked!
lf to be old and merry, be a sin,
then many l know is damned.
lf to be fat, to be hated, many
a monk shalt be burnt.
No, my lord, banish Peto,
banish Bardolph,...
...banish Poins,
but for sweet Falstaff,...
...kind Jack Falstaff,
true Jack Falstaff,...
And therefore more valiant
Jack Falstaff,...
...being as he is old
Jack Falstaff,...
...banish not him thy
Harry's company.
Banish plump Jack...
and banish all the world!
l do.
l will
-O, my lord, my lord!
-What's the matter?
The sheriff and all the watch
are come to search the house.
Out, you rogue! l have much to
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
Go hide. Now, my masters, for a
true face and good conscience.
Both which l have had, but their
date is out, and so l hide me.
What is your will with me,
master sheriff?
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue
and cry hath followed men here.
What men?
One of them is well known
a gross fat man.
As fat as butter!
The man, l do assure you, is not
here, let me entreat you leave.
l will, my lord.
There are two gentlemen have
in this robbery lost 300 mark.
lf he have robb'd these men,
he shall be answerable.
-Farewell.
-Good-night, my lord.
l'll to the court in the morning,
we must all to the wars.
Good-night, my noble lord.
l think it is good-morrow,
is it not?
lndeed, my lord.
We shall have to fight, ha?
Hostess, make ready breakfast.
You owe me money, Sir John!
-l lent thee some 23 pound.
-Go, you thing, go.
Say, what thing?
l am an honest man's wife and...
...setting thy knighthood aside,
thou art a knave to call me so.
Setting thy womanhood aside,
thou art a beast to say other.
-Say, what beast, thou knave?
-What beast?
-Why, an otter.
-An otter, sir John?
Why an otter?
Neither fish nor flesh, a man not
knows where to have' her.
Thou know what thou sayest!
Thou, or any man knows where
to have me. Thou knave, thou!
Thou sayest true,
he slanders thee most grossly.
So he doth you, my lord.
And said this other day that
you ought him 1,000 pound.
-Do l owe you 1,000 pound?
-A million pound, a million.
Thy love is worth a million.
Thou owest me thy love.
My sweet Jack, l must still be
good angel to thee.
My lord, he'd call you
an ass and a crafty,...
-...he would cudgel you.
-Did you?
As thou art man, l dare, but
as thou art prince,...
...l fear thee, as l fear
the lion's whelp.
-Why not as the lion?
-The king is to be feared thus.
Dost thou think l'll fear thee
as l fear thy father?
The money is paid back again.
O, l do not like that paying
back: 'tis a double labour.
Whoreson!
Thou tender sucking pig,...
...hungry bear!
Come, let's be friends, Jack.
Thou shalt go to wars, and who
knowest we shalt meet again.
Who carest?
Farewell, fat Jack.
Farewell, winter rose!
Percy, Northumberland,...
...the archbishop of York,
Douglas, Mortimer,...
...capitulate against us.
But, wherefore do l tell thee
of my foes,...
...which are my near'st and
dear'st enemy?
To fight against me under
Percy's pay,...
...to dog his heels,
and court'sy at his frowns,...
...to show how much thou
art degenerate.
Lords, give us leave.
The Prince of Wales and l must
have some conference.
l know not whether God
will have it so...
...for some displeasing service
l have done,...
...that is his secret doom,
out of my blood,...
...He'll breed a scourge for me.
Tell me else,...
...could such inordinate and low
desires, such poor, such bare,...
...rude society, accompany...
-...the greatness of thy blood?
-l beg Your Majesty...
Hath faulty wander'd and
irregular so common-hackney'd...
...in the eyes of men's opinion,
that did help me to the crown,...
...l should be deposed.
None lovest a king who goest
with shallow jesters,...
...mingled his royalty
with carping fools.
He was but the cuckoo
is in June, heard, not regarded,...
...seen but with such eyes,
as sick and blunted with...
...community, afford no gaze, such
as is bent on sun-like majesty,...
...when it shines seldom in
admiring eyes.
And that line, stand'st thou.
For thou hast lost thy princely
privilege with vile participation.
Not an eye but is a-weary
of thy common sight.
Save mine, which hath
desire'd to see thee more.
l shall hereafter, my thrice-
gracious lord, be more myself.
As thou art to this hour,
was Richard then,...
...when l from France set
foot at Ravenspurg,...
...and even as l was
then is Percy now!
Now, by my sceptre, and
my soul to boot,...
...he hath more worthy interest
to the State than thou.
Do not think so.
l will redeem all this on Percy's
head, and in the closing...
...of some glorious day, be bold
to tell you that l am your son.
And that shall be the day,
whene'er it lights,...
...that this same child of honour
and renown, this gallant Hotspur...
...and your unthought-of
Harry, chance to meet.
l shall make this northern
youth exchange...
...his glorious deeds for
my indignities,...
...this is the name of God,
l vow here.
The Earl of Westmoreland
set forth to-day...
...three days aft, thou
shall set forward.
-Damn!
-Damn you, woolsack!
We must war together, why use
daggers against eachother?
Thou vipers, thou!
l am Pistol, if thou darest
load me, l'll shoot.
Pay the 8s. l won from thou
playing bowls.
-He who payset is a vile slave.
-Swine!
Who is it who flees?
-Falstaff, Your Highness.
-The one involved in the theft?
O, my lord, the Judge.
l heard thou was sick...
...l would you have come
out under doctor's orders.
Thy youth is not over yet,
but thou art old,...
...and thou canst feel
the action of time on thyself,...
...pray, take care of thyself.
Westmoreland, my lord!
l thought thou had been
at Shrewsbury.
'This time for us both
to be there.
What, is the king encamped?
He is, and l fear we
shall stay too long.
Sir John, l did never see
such pitiful rascals.
Methinks they are poor - bare.
lf l be not ashamed of my
soldiers, l am a soused gurnet.
l have misused the king's
press damnably,...
...they have bought out
their services...
...and now my whole change
consists of revolted tapsters...
...and ostlers tradefallen,...
...cankers of a calm
world and long peace.
-Falstaff, we must leave.
-The king looks for us all.
-Cometh you with the Prince?
-You follow him from here to...
-...there, hence an evil spirit.
-You hast perverted the prince.
-He did so to me.
-You lead a vile life.
Thy means are slender,
and thy waste is great.
l would it be otherwise! My
means greater, but my waist not.
The white hairs on thy face,
should maketh thou...
-..learn the graveness.
-The fat... the fat.
You, that are old consider
not the capacities of us...
...thou measure thy ardousness
against the roughness of thy skin.
-Dost thou think thyself young?
-All in thou art old.
Have you not a moist eye?
A dry hand? A yellow cheek?
-A white beard?
-A decreasing leg?
A broken voice when tired?
And thy faculties
ruin'd through old age?
-Even so, thou call thyself young?
-l was born at three in the...
...afternoon carrying a white head,
a round belly, the voice l lost...
...in singing and hollaing.
Sir John, you must recruit
more soldiers in other counties...
-...we must leave at once!
-Set forth!
Pray be humble, and pray
God to protect thy men.
Will you give me 1,000 pound
for my men?
Lay out, lay out.
Fare you well.
-My lord...
-Not one pence.
-Bardolph, give me a cop os sack.
-Will you give me money?
Pray God he giveth a good ally
to the prince!
Pray Heavens above he giveth
the ally a good prince.
-What news?
-The Earl of Westmoreland...
...strong, is marching
hitherwards with Prince John.
No harm, what more?
-The king himself is set forth.
-He shall be welcome too!
Where is his son, the nimble-
footed madcap Prince of Wales,...
...and his comrades, that daff'd
the world aside and bid it pass?
All furnish'd, all in arms. By the
lord, cousin, wait for help!
Gentlemen, life is
always short...
...but, if lived cowardly,
it would prove far too long...
...even if it lasted one hour.
lf we dost live, it is
to tread on king's heads.
lf we are to die, it shall be
beautiful, if we die with princes.
-Justice Shallow?
-l am, a poor knight...
...from this same county, and one
of the king's peace justices.
My captain sends regards.
My captain, Sir John Falstaff...
...a handsome knightand a
brave captain.
Welcome, sir.
Davy?
l thinkest...
Soldiers art coming...
Take good care of them,
for they art but axes knives.
Let them use them on themselves,
for they come looking shaby.
Why, Davy, how funny!
O, sir,! Go away!
Give me your hand, highness.
-Welcome, sir John.
-Master Robert Shallow...
...l am glad to see thou again.
Thy house is beautiful.
You shall see mine orchard...
...we'll eat a last year's pippin
of my own graffing.
With a dish of carraways.
Have you provided me here half
a dozen sufficient men?
Marry, have we, sir.
Let's see. Where's the roll?
Davy!
Robert Shallow...
l do remember him at
Clement's,...
...like a man made after supper
of a cheese-paring.
When he was naked, he was
like a forked radish, he was...
...the very genious of famine,
yet lecherous as a monkey.
And now, this Vice's dagger,
become a squire, and now has...
...he land and beeves.
l will be acquainted with him.
A friend i'the court is better
than a penny in purse, take care.
Let me see! Let them
appear as l call.
Master Surecard, as l think?
-Er...
-Silence!
Sir John, it is my cousin Silence
in comission with me.
Good Master Silence, it well
befits you'd be of the peace.
The very same, Sir John.
Your Highness,...
l would break Skogan's head
at school when a child!
And the very same day,
l'd hit a Sampson Stockfish,...
...a fruiterer, behind Gray's inn.
Jesu, the mad days l have spent!
Master Silence, let's see those
men, Master Silence.
Name them in order, cousin.
Quick!
Mouldy.
-Mouldy?
-Yes, my lord.
lt is time you were spent.
Mouldy!
Things that are mouldy,
lack use.
Prick him.
You need not to have
pricked me,...
...my old dame'll be undone
now for one to do the drudgery.
-Prick him.
-Prick him!
-Thomas Wart.
-Here, sir.
-There are other men fitter.
-Stand aside, Mouldy.
-ls Wart good enough, sir?
-His apparel is built upon his...
-...back, prick him no more.
-Then, Simon Shadow.
Shadow? Shadow will
serve good for summer.
You can do it, sir!
Prick him.
Let's see another.
Francis Feeble, cousin!
-What trade art thou, Feeble?
-A woman's tailor, sir.
Wilt thou make as many holes
in an enemy's battle as thou...
-..hast done in a woman's robe?
-l'll do my good, but no more.
Well said!
Well said, courageous Feeble!
Thou wilt be as valiant
as a magnanimous mouse!
Prick the woman's tailor,
Master Silence.
Prick him, Master Silence.
-Who is next?
-Peter Bullcalf of the Green!
O lord, my lord captain.
Dost thou roar before
thou art pricked?
-O, lord, sir! l'm a diseased man.
-What disease has thou?
A cough, sir, which l caught
with ringing...
...in the king's
affairs upon his coronation day.
We will have away thy cold, and
thy friends shall ring for thee.
Prick him.
-ls here all?
-Here's more than your number.
-Good master corporal Captain...
-Go to, stand aside.
l had as lief be hanged,
as go to war.
Sir captain...
-Here is four French crowns.
-Stand aside.
You shall have 40, sir. For
my old dame's sake, she has...
-...nobody when l am gone.
-Go to, stand aside.
Let it go which way it will.
Sir, l have three pound to free
Mouldy and Bullcalf.
Mouldy, stay at home till you
are past service.
Bullcalf,
growtill you come unto it.
-But they are your likeliest men.
-Will you tell me howto choose?
Wart, he shall charge you and
discharge you with the motion...
...of a pewterer's hammer, and
this half-faced fellow, he...
...presents no mark to the enemy
and for a retreat, how swiftly...
...will this Feeble, the woman's
tailor, run off.
O, give me the spare men,...
...and spare me the great one
Fare you well.
-Sir John, Heaven bless you.
-Fare you well.
-Bardolph, get new sticks.
-There are none.
Give the soldiers clothes.
Heaven bless you, Sir John!
And prosper your affairs!
And send us peace!
How now, Worcester! 'Tis not
well that you and l...
...should meet upon such terms,
you have deceiv'd our trust...
...and made us doff our easy
robes of peace, to crush our...
...old limbs in ungentle steel;
this is not well, my lord.
My liege, l do protest, l have not
sought the day of this dislike.
-How comes it, then?
-Rebellion lay in his way,...
-...and he found it.
-Peace, chewet, peace.
Tell your nephew, the Prince
of Wales, doth join...
...with all the world in praise
of Henry Percy, l do not think...
...a braver gentleman,
more bold and daring.
l say it to my shame. l have
a truant been to chivalry.
Yet, this before my father's
majesty, l am content that he...
...shall take the odds of his great
name and will, to save the...
...blood of more Englishmen.
We love our people well,
even those that are misled...
...upon us and will they take
the offer of our grace,...
...every man shall be my friend
again, and l'll his.
We offer fair.
Take it advisely.
lt will not be accepted,
on my life.
God befriend us, as our
case is just.
Pray Harry hears not
the king's offer.
What sayest to thee?
There is no seeming
mercy in the king.
He calls us rebels, traitors,
and will scourge.
Arms, gentlemen; to arms!
Soldiers, comrades,
every leader to his charge.
l aswear to thee l shall stain
this sword with the best blood!
The Prince of Wales said before
the king, he would defy you...
-...you in battle.
-lf it were to befall upon...
...the Prince of Wales and myself,
l would be ready to even die.
-l would l could sleep now.
-Why, thou owest God a death.
'Tis not due yet; l would be
lothe to pay Him before his day.
What need l be so forward
with Him that calls not on me?
But that matters not,
for honour pricks me.
But how if honour prick me off
when l come on? Howthen?
Can honour set-to an arm, or
take away the grief of a wound?
Hath it no skill in surgery?
What is honour?
Air, only air. Who hath it?
He that died on Wednesday,
doth he feel it? No.
ls it insensible, then?
Yea, to the dead,...
...but will it not live with
the living? No.
Detraction will not suffer it,
therefore l'll none of it.
Honour is a mere scutcheon,
and so end my catechism.
Come, let me taste my horse,
against the Prince of Wales!
Harry to Harry shall,
not horse to horse,...
...meet, and ne'er part till one
drop down a corse.
-What stand'st thou idle here?
-Give me leave to breathe awhile.
The Great Turk never did such
deeds in arms as l have done...
-...this day, l have paid Percy.
-lndeed, and living to kill thee.
lf l mistake not, thou art Harry.
Thou speak'st as if l would
deny my name.
-My name is Harry Percy.
-One England can not brook'...
...a double reign, of Harry Percy
and the Prince of Wales.
Nor shall it, for the hour is
come to end the one of us.
Well said, Hal! To it, Hal!
Go on, boy!
lt will be not easy, Percy!
Harry,
thou hast robb'd me of youth.
l better brook the loss of brittle
life, than those proud titles...
...thou hast won of me. They
wound my thought worse than...
...thy sword my flesh, but
thought's the slave of life...
...and life, time's fool, and
time must have a stop.
O, l could prophesy...
...but that the earthly and cold
hand of death lies on my tongue.
Percy...
...thou are dust, and food for...
...for worms, brave Percy.
Fare thee well, great heart.
lll weav'd ambition when
that this body did...
...contain a spirit, a kingdom
for it was too small a bound,...
...but nowtwo paces of
heaven, is room enough.
This earth bears not alive
so stout a gentleman.
Adieu!
What old acquaintance.
Could not all this flesh
keep in a little life?
Farewell, poor Jack. l could have
better spar'd a better man.
Embowell'd will l see thee
by and by.
Embowell'd?
lf thou embowell me to-day,
powder and eat me later.
l hath to pretend to be dead.
The better part of value
is discretion.
ln the which better part
l have saved my life.
Lord, why tis brave Percy!
l'll swear l did it.
The trumpet sounds retreat,
the day is ours.
'Tis the ending that awaits
for every rebel.
lll-spirited Worcester,...
...did we not send grace, pardon
and terms of love to all of you?
-l've done,as my safety urg'd.
-Bear him to the death.
Other offenders we will
pause on.
Brother, let's go to the hill
to see who cometh.
There is Percy.
lf your father
will do me any honour, so,...
...if not, let him kill the
next Percy himself.
Why, Percy l killed myself
and sawthee dead.
Lord, howthis world is
given to lying!
l was down and out of breath,
and so was he; but we rose...
...at an instant, and
fought a long hour.
l shall not be any less
than an Earl or Duke.
Father!
Another glorious day
such as this...
...and we will and
rebellion in our kingdom.
Falstaff, thou shall go with
prince John of Lancaster...
-...against Nothumberland.
-No dangerous project...
...can keep me away.
l will not be here forever,
but these tricks...
...from England l findst tiring.
Falstaff, the king will have
thee part from Harry.
Nay, l owest to thy wit.
Prince of Lancaster! This young
sober-blooded boy...
...doth not love me, nor a man
cannot make him laugh.
But there's not marvel,
he drinks no wine.
There's never any of these
demure boys come to any proof.
The drink doth so over-cool
their blood, that they are...
...generally fools and cowards,
which come of us would be too,...
...but for inflammation.
A good sherris-sack that a
twofold operation,...
...it ascendens me into the brain,
dries me then all the foolish...
...and dull vapours wich
environ it, makes it quick,...
...full of nimble, fiery and
delectable shapes,...
...which deliver'd to the tongue,
which is the birth,...
...becomes excellent wit.
The other property of your
excellent sherris is the warmth.
The blood warms up, and makes
it course from inside.
Hereof comes it that prince
Hal is valiant.
For the cold blood he
inherited of his father...
...he manured and water'd
with endeavour of...
...drinking good fertile sherris...
...that he is become very
hot and valiant.
lf l had a thousand sons
l would teach them to quit...
...any thin drink and to
addict themselves to...
...sack.
''The reing of king Henry lV,
wast from the beginning...
...by rebellion, but it the year
or Our Lord 1408,...
...the last of his enemies
hath been defeated.
That year, the king spent
Christmastime in London,...
...but his health was undermined
through sickness.''
Many good-morrows
your majesty.
-ls it good-morrows, lords?
-'Tis one o'clock and past.
Why, then good-morrows,
my lords.
Where is the Prince of Wales?
Where is he?
ls not his brother John of
Lancaster, with him?
-No, my good lord, he is here.
-Thou must sleep, my lord,...
...thou hath been sick for fifteen
days, it shall wreck thy health.
-What would my lord?
-Thou should at Windsor...
-...with thy brother.
-He dines in on London.
And how accompanied?
With Poins and other his
continual followers.
Most subjet is the fattest
soil to weeds.
And he, the noble image of my
youth, is overspread with them.
My grief streches itself beyond
the hour of death.
The blood weeps from my heart
when l do shape,...
...in froms imaginary,...
...the unguided days and rotten
times that you shall look...
...upon when l'm sleeping
with my ancestors.
My good lord, you look
beyond him quite.
The prince will, in time,
cast off his followers.
'Tis seldom when the bee
doth leave her comb.
Enter not, he hath a fit.
He cannot long hold art
these pangs.
The incessant labour
of his mind hath...
...worn out the shell that
contains life.
The crown. Give me the crown.
Set it upon my pillow.
Let there be no noise made,
my gentle friends.
Unless some dull and favourable
hand will whisper...
...music to my weary spirit.
Call for the music
in the other room!
l fear the people....
...for, it hast seen montruos
deliveries from Nature.
Seasons hast changed their
weather, as if the year...
...would have leaped some
months.
The river hardly hath any
water running,...
...and the old wise man, he who
speak'st of past times,...
...says the same
happened but once before,...
...when' the great king
Edward was sick, close to death.
How many of my poorest
subjects are at this hour asleep?
O, gentle sleep, Nature's
soft nurse...
...how l have frighted thee,
that thou no more wilt weigh...
...my eyelids down, and steep
my senses in forgetfulness?
Why, rather, sleep, liest
thou in smoky cribs, upon'...
...uneasy pallets stretching thee,
and hush'd with buzzing night...
...flies to thy slumber,
than in the perfum'd chambers...
...of the great, under canopies
of costly state, and lull'd with...
...sounds of sweetest melody?
O, thou dull god, why liest
thou with the vile...
...in loathsome beds, and leav'st
the kingly couch a watch-case...
...or a common larum bell?
Wilt thou upon the high mast
seal up the ship-boy's eyes...
...and rock his brains in cradle
of the rure imperious surge...
...and in the visitation of the
winds, who take the billows...
...by the top, hanging them with
deafening clamour in the...
...slippery shrouds, that with
the hurly, death itself awakes?
Canst thou, o partial sleep,...
...give thy repose to the wet...
...sea-boy in an hour so rude,...
...and in the calmest and
stillest night,...
...with all appliances and
means to boot,...
...deny it to a king?
Then, happy low.
Lie down,...
...uneasy lies the head
that wears a crown.
Before God, l am
exceeding weary.
ls it come to that?
l had thought weariness durst
not have attacked one of...
-...so high blood.
-lt does me,...
...thou it discolours the
complexion of my greatness.
-God save your grace.
-And yours, most noble Bardolph.
-And how doth thy master?
-ln bodily health.
''Sir John Falstaff, knight,
to the son of the king,...
...nearest his father, Harry,
Prince of Wales, greeting.
Be not too familiar with...'' The
ass takest too many a liberty.
'' Be not too familiar with Poins,
for he misuses thy favours,...
...so much that he swears thou
art to marry his sister Nell.
My lord, l'll make him eat it!
Repent at idle times as thou
mayest, and so farewell.
Thine, by yea and no, as thou
usest him,...
...Jack Falstaff with friends,
John with siblings,...
...and Sir John with all Europe.''
ls he in London?
Yes, my lord, with Mrs. Doll.
Shall we steal upon them,
Ned, at supper?
You boy, Bardolph, no word to
your master that l am to London.
-There's for your silence.
-l have no tongue, sir.
For mine, sir, l'll govern it.
Doth it now showvilely in
me to desire small beer?
How many young princes would
do as thy, their fathers being...
...so sick as yours at this time?
Let the devil carry me away
if l listen to thy to-morrow!
Do you use me thus, must
l marry your sister, Nelly?
God send the wench have no
worse fate. But l never said so.
-Come, Ned.
-l'll be thy shadow.
l followthy, my lord.
Lord!
My heart bleeds inwardly
that my father is so sick.
Sir John, thou art so fat, that
l dare say thou wilt last not.
There you are!
-Around, l mighst be...
-Two yards, or more.
Round the waist, about the same.
l speak not of plentyfulness,...
...but of sorrows.
l shall have to sack some of
mine. There art no other way.
l shall take Bardolph,
he shall pour for me.
That be a pleasant task.
Lads,...
...l am left penniless.
Doll,...
ls that all the comfort you
give me?
Who knock'st on the door thus?
-You muddy raskal!
-You make fat raskals.
l make them not, gluttony
and diseases make them.
lf the cook help to make the
gluttony,...
...you help to the diseases.
Those we catch of you.
To come of the breach with his
pike bent bravely,...
...to venture upon the charged
chamber bravely...
Hang yourself, you
muddy conger!
You two never meet, but
you fall to some discord.
You art both as gouty
as dry toasts.
You have drunk too much
Canaries, good wine.
-How art thou?
-Better than before.
Well said.
Thy goodness, shines as gold.
What the good year, one must
bear, and that must be you.
Sir, Pistol would speak
with you.
Pistol?
lt is the foul-mouth'dst
rogue in England!
-Hang him, swaggering raskal!
-Swagger?
Empty the chamberpot.
-lf he swagger, let him not in.
-He art no swagger.
A tame cheater, you may stroke
him as a puppy greyhound.
-Pistol!
-God save you, Sir John.
l charge you with a cup of
sack, do you discharge upon...
-...my hostess.
-l will, with two bullets.
She is pistol-proof, you
shall hardly offend her.
Then to you, Mrs. Dorothy,
l will charge you.
-Charge me? You scurvy raskal?
-My sword, Bardolph.
l'll thrust my knife as you play
the savoy cuttle with me.
l'll murder your ruff for this.
-Pistol, l would not have go off.
-Nay, not here, good captain.
-Captain?
-Come dawn, captain.
Captain for what? For tearing a
poor whore's ruff in a bawdy?
Shall packhorses of Asia,
compare with Caessars,...
...and with Cannibals, and Trojan
Greeks? Canst thou hear me?
You raskal!
Untwine the Sisters Three!
Are you not hurt in
the groin?
Me thought he made a shrewd
thrust at your belly.
The raskal!
-You sweet little rogue.
-You huge raskal...!
Thou whoreson little
boar-pig...
O love, howthou sweatest!
The raskal fled as if
mercury.
Let me wipe thy face.
Come on, you chops...
O, rogue, i'faith l love thee.
-l shall have him killed!
-Make it an order if thou...
...lovest me, and l shall be
gratefull between my bedsheets.
-The music is come, sir.
-Let them play!
Let them play!
What wilt thou have? l shall
receive money on Monday.
Thou shalt have a
cap to-morrow.
Come, sing a merry song
and make me gay!
Thou wilt forget me when
l am gone.
Thou wilt set me a weeping
an thou sayest so.
Kiss me, Doll.
ls it not strange that desire
should so outlive performance?
Thou dost give flattering busses.
l kiss thee with a most
constant heart.
l am old.
l am old.
l love thee better than l
love e'er a young boy.
An the Prince...?
-What humour is the prince of?
-Yes.
-A good shallow young fellow.
-Didst thou cut an ear off?
-And Poins, he a good wit?
-Poins, a wit?
Let us beat him before
his whore?
Poins and the prince
are such another.
A bastard son of the king's!
And art thou not
Poins, his brother?
My lord, he will drive you out
of your revenge.
How, you fat fool!
-Stuffed pork!
-No abuse, Hal.
Thou globe of sinful continents.
Thou art the most pleasant
and raskal of a prince.
Howvilely did you speak of me
even now before this...
-...honest gentlewoman?
-l did not think thou wast here.
And you knew me, as you did
when you ran away by Gadshill.
You spoke it on purpose to
try my patience.
l dispraised thee before the
wicked, that they might not...
...fall in love with thee, and
thy father is to thank me for it.
And now, whether fear or
cowardice, thou wrong this lady.
-ls Doll of the wicked?
-ls thine hostess?
Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal
burns in his nose?
The fiend hath picked down
Bardolph. For the women,...
...one of them, she is in hell
already, and burns, poor soul.
The other, l owe money to, if she
be damned for that, l know not.
By the way, have l not
shrunk considerably?
My skin hangs off as that
of an old woman's.
Sirrah, you giant, what says
the doctor of my water?
He said, sir, the water itself
was a good healthy water, but...
...for the party that owned it,
he might have many diseases.
Men take a pride to gird at me;
the brain of this foolish old'...
...is not able to invent anything
that tends to laughter,...
...more than l invent or is
invented on me.
l am not only witty in myself,
but the cause wit is in others.
l feel guilty of using up
such precious time.
l tell thee, my heart bleeds
inwardly that my father is sick.
-Shall l tell thee one thing?
-Yes, and let it be witty.
lt shall serve among wits of
no higher breeding than thine.
Go to...
...l stand the push of your one
thing that you will tell.
l could tell to thee, as to one
it pleased me to call my friend...
...l could be sad.
Sad indeed.
Very hardly upon such a subject.
That think'st me as far in the
devil's book as thou and l?
An old lord at the Counsel, told
me off the other day,...
...thruogh thee, but l listened
not to him. But he wast right.
-And on the street, too.
-Wisdom is shouting on the...
-...streets, but nobody listens.
-Thou speak'st the truth,...
...wisdom, as ignorance, get thee
as a disease would.
-Ned.
-Yes, my lord?
Let men feel untrustworthy
in thy company.
What wouldst thou think of me
if l should weep?
l would think thee a most
princely hypocrite.
l have forsworn his company
hourly, any time...
...this twenty-two year.
-They all believe me a hypocrit.
-Yet l'm bewitched with him.
lf the raskal have not given me
medicines to make me love him...
-...l'll be hanged.
-Thou shall understand it later.
lt could not be else,
l have drunk medicines.
My lord!
Dost sack induce gout,
or gout induce pus,...
...for one and the other have
my foot in flames!
All the better if l am to be a
limp, l have fought for the king...
...ha, lads? For then my
pension would be more adecuate.
Wit seeks its own benefit, l
shall take advantage of this case.
Good night,...
...Falstaff!
Now, when the sweetes
mouthful of the night is about...
...to reach me, l must
part without it.
Lad, let's go to Gloucester, to
see Master Robert Shallow,...
...the knight. He stands held
firmly between my fingers.
l shall soon muzzle him.
When wilt thou stop'st the
fighting in the day, and the...
...feasting all the night, and
come to peace with the heavens?
Quiet, Doll, dost
speak not to me as to a skull,...
...remind me not of my
last hour.
-Farewell, Dora.
-Well, sweet Jack.
-Farewell.
-Have a care of thyself.
-Who sawthe Duke of Lancaster?
-l am here, brother.
Full of heaviness.
Rain within doors,
and none abroad?
-How doth the king?
-Exceedinly ill.
Why doth the crown lie
there upon his pillow?
She is a restless bedfellow.
O majesty...
...thou art like a rich armour
worn in the heat of the day,...
...that scalds with safety.
My father, my lord!
Good king.
This is a sleep that
from this golden rigol...
...hath divorc'd so
many English kings.
Thy due from me is tears.
And heavy sorrows of the blood,
which nature,...
...love and' filial tenderness,...
...shall pay thee...
...plenteously.
My due from thee is this
imperial crown, which...
...which God shall guard.
And put the world's whole
strength into one giant arm,...
...it shall not force this lineal
honour from me.
Cousin Silenec, that thou hadst
seen that that this knight...
...have seen, said l well, sir?
We have heard the chimes
at midnight, Master Shallow.
That we have, that we have.
ln faith, sir John, we have.
O, Jesu, Jesu, the days
that we have seen.
And to see how many of my old
acquaintance are dead!
-We shall all follow...
-Very true,...
...as the Psalmist saith,
'tis certain to all.
All shall die.
How a good yoke of
bullocks at the fair?
A yoke of...?
ls old Tom, of your
town living yet?
De...
Dead? Jesu, Jesu, dead.
He drew a good bow.
Jesu, and dead?
John of Gaunt loved him well
and betted much money on him.
-Dead.
-Dead.
Hast thou seen a good
score of ewes?
Ewes or...
-So Ton is dead?
-Dead.
My lords!
-Lancaster, Westmoreland!
-What dost thou want from us?
-Why did you leave me alone?
-My brother was here.
The Prince of Wales?
-ls he not here?
-He undertook to watch for you.
Where is the crown?
Who took it from my pillow?
Canst thou forebear me
half an hour?
Then get thee gone, and dig my
grave thyself,...
...and bid the merry bells ring
to thine ear,...
...that l am dead, that thou
crown'd. Pluck down my officers.
Break my decrees. For a time
is come to mock at form.
Harry V is crown'd!
Up vanity, down the
royal state.
And to the English court
assemble now,...
...from every region, apes of
idleness.
Counties, purge you of
your scum,...
...have you a ruffian that will
swear, drink, revel the night...
...and commit the oldest
sins the newest of ways?
Be happy, he'll trouble thee not.
For war shall give him office,
honour, might, for Harry V...
...from curb'd license plucks
and the wild dog shall...
...flesh his tooth in
every innocent.
-l never thought to hear you.
-Thy wish wast granted.
l stay too long by thee,
l weary thee.
O, pardon me, my liege.
l canst see why thou hast taken
the crown.
God witness me, when l came
in, and found no breath...
...within thee, how cold struck
my heart. l thought thee dead.
Accusing it, l put it on my head
to try with it,...
''lt hadst before my face
murder'd my father.
Your gold is, not beautiful,
but hateful.
Another of lower karrat
is more beautiful,...
...but thou though finer, devour
all those you take!''
Thus it was, my liege,
accusing the crown...
...l put it on my head, to try
with it as with an enemy...
...that had
murdered my father.
The quarrel of a true inheritor.
O, my son!
God put it in thy mind
to take it hence,...
...that thou mightst win the
more thy father's love,...
...pleading so wisely
in excuse for it.
Hear, l think, the very latest
counsel that ever...
...l shall breathe.
God knows, by what by-paths
and crook'd ways l met this...
...crown, for all my reign hath
been but a scene,...
...acting that argument, and now
my death changes the mode.
For what in me was purchas'd,
falls upon thee in a more fairer...
...sort, yet, though thou stand'st
more sure than l could do,...
...thou art not firm
enough, since...
...griefs are green. And all
my friends, which thou...
...must make thy friends, have
their stings and teeth newly out.
And by whose power l well
might lodge a fear,...
...to be again displac'd.
Harry, be it thy course
to busy giddy minds...
...with foreign quarrels, that
action, hence borne out...
...may waste the memory of the
former days.
l am weak,...
...and my lungs are wasted so,...
...that strength of speech is
utterly denied me.
O, God forgive me...
...how l came to the crown,...
...and grant it may with thee...
...in true peace...
How art the king?
-He no longer lives.
-God save the king!
God save the king!
Thou look upon me in
a strange manner.
l shall turn those weeping
tears into happy hours.
We'd expect no less from thee.
Within myself, the wave of blood
hath been but utter vanity.
Now, it returns and flows
towards the sea, where it shall...
...mingle with others, and thus,
flow again with majestic calm.
Call for Parliament!
l was once of St. Clements-inn,
where l think they will talk...
...of mad Shallow, yet.
You were called lusty Shallow!
l was called anything and l
would have done anything too.
Then was Jack Falstaff,
now sir John,...
...a boy, and loyal page to...
...the Duke of Norfolk.
Ha, sir John?
-l have drunk a lot to-night.
-l shall be merry.
We shall be merry and now
comes the sweet of the night.
Hey, lad!
O, Jesu, Jesu, the days
that we have seen!
O, Lord,...
...how we old men like
this vice of telling lies.
This foolish justice, boasts
he hath been a sinner...
...in his youth, but, i'faith,...
...of every three words,
one is lie.
-Sir John!
-l am coming, Master Shallow!
l am coming.
l shall get so much out of this
Shallow, that prince Harry...
...wilt hath to laugh for some
two or three years.
Thou shall see.
Thou shall see.
An it please your worship,...
...there is one Pistol come
from the court with news.
From the court?
Sir John, l am thy Pistol,
thy friend.
And helter-skelter have
l rode to thee, with lucky joys...
...and golden times.
And happy news of price.
Pistol, what is thy news?
A foutra for the world and
worldlings, l speak of joys.
Thou art one of the
great persons of the kingdom!
Give me pardon, sir, if you come
with news from the court,...
...l am under the king
in authority.
Under which king, bezonian.
Speak or die!
Under King Harry.
-Harry lV, or V?
-Harry the fourth.
A foutra for thy office!
Sir John, thy tender lambkin now
is king. Harry V is the man.
ls the old king...
-...dead?
-As nail in door.
Away!
Saddle my horse, the
young King would see me!
Master Shallow, choose what
office thou wilt, 'tis thine.
Pistol, l will double thy dignities
Good Silence, my lord Silence,...
...l am a fortune's steward.
Come, Pistol, utter more to me,...
...and withal, devise something
to do thyself good.
Let us take any horses, the laws
of England are at my command.
Happy are they which have
been my friends!
And woe unto my Chief-Justice!
God bless thy lungs, sir.
Waves are roaring, trumpets
are sounding!
Stand by me, Master Shallow,
l shall have the king note thee.
l shall wink my eye at him,
and thou shall see his face.
lf l hath had the time,
l would have taken him...
...presents with the 1,000
pounds thou lent me.
But, fret not, to go
wrong is worse.
-l shall show my haste.
-Yes, do.
-He shall see my warmth.
-So he shall.
-My devotion.
-That is right.
Riding night and day, not
thinking of what suit to wear...
...only wanting to reach there,
may it be dirty, thirsty,...
...sweaty, with not a moment to
rest, for it shall not be...
...necesary to sleep well,
my only task is to get to him.
God save thy, little one!
Dost thou know
not who thou speak'st to?
My king, my little one!
l speak'st to thy.
Old man, l do not knowthee,
kneel down.
Nay, never a white beard has
become a clown.
For a long time, l have
dreamt with one,...
...so bloated through orgy,
so old and so profane.
But once awake, l have
discharged mine dream.
From this day, reduce thy
body, and widen thy virtue,...
...quit gluttony, the
grave is about open for thy,...
...as three times the bigger
as for any other man.
lf you would answer
with some foolish remarks,...
...think first l am not
the man l once wast.
For Heaven knows, and the
world shall know,...
...that l hath rejected the
man in myself,...
...and so l shall do with
those who were my friends.
lf l ever become what l once
was, come close to me,...
...and thou shalt be what you
were, my tutor in all my excess.
Until then, l exile thee,
under penalty of death,...
...as the rest of mine
corruptors.
l forbid thee to stand
less than 10 miles from myself.
l shall provide for thou,...
...so you dost make
the wrong.
And if we hear of thy
ammendment, then,...
...we shall take you back
with thy merits and faculties.
See that my orders are
obeyed, my lord.
Master Shallow,...
-...l owest thee 1,000 pounds.
-Yes, sir John,...
-...and l hope to get it back.
-That l think difficult, Master.
Regret it not,...
...for he feign, before all.
He shall call me to see
me alone.
Don't worry not for thy things,
l am yet the man...
-...that shall make you grand.
-l see not how.
Unless thou give me thy
filled with straw.
Sir John, l beg thee,
give me back 500, at least.
Sir,...
...l always pay...
...my debts.
What the king hath said,
'tis just a pretension.
-Which will kill thee, sir John.
-What a fright!
Let's have supper, everybody!
He shall call on me
more into the night.
l likest the king's
fair manner.
-Thou art all in exile.
-Until thou lives...
-...become more modest.
-He hast ordered that all...
-...the raskals be well provided.
-You starving fool!
-Jack Falstaff!
-Take him to prison!
-To prison?
-Come with me!
Thou must come, poor lad.
Gentlemen, do come,
he is very sick.
The king is a great one,...
...but things are as they lay.
And now, to France!
lt shall be an easy fight,...
...a jolly fight.
Go, my dear patriots.
The sign of war goes forward,...
...not queen of England,
but of France!
My lord Chief Justice, free
the man who is in prison.
-Falstaff?
-He shall suffer prison.
His example may help
others such as him.
lf we close not our eyes
to small offenses,...
...what then shall we do
when we see...
...capital crimes and
premeditated ones?
l think it was the
excess wine that did it.
And Falstaff?
He has died.
The king hast broken
his poor heart.
l would be with him,
where'er it may be.
-Be it in Heaven, or in Hell.
-No, he shall not be in Hell.
He art in Heaven, in peace, if
any man reachest there.
He hath a nice death,...
...he went like
a new born baby.
He passed away between noon
and one o'clock,...
...with the lowtide.
When l saw him play with
the flowers, like a boy,...
...and wave his sheets, l knew
he was to die,...
...for his nise was pointed
over green fields.
l said: ''Hello, Sir John,
come, man, be happy.''
And he said three or four
times: ''Lord, Lord, Lord!''
To calm him, l begged him
not to call God,...
...l thought it not
his moment for that.
He asked to put
some sheets on thy feet
l touched them
throu the sheets...
...but they are as cold
as marble.
l did the same with thy
knees,...
...then above, and even above,...
...he was all very cold,
as marble.
-He ask'd for wine.
-And women?
No.
He did not ask for that.
He said the devil would take
him for that reason.
He said that was his
most dangerous sin.
One day he saw Bardolph,
a flea on his nose,...
...he said it was but a soul
burning in Hell.
The fuel that keep'st that
fire has long ago gone.
Friendship is the only wealth
that l got under his office.
''The new king, since his
own coronation...
...decided to be a different man.
This Henry was such a prudent king,
and such an able polititian,...
...that ever did anything
without studying before it,...
...the posibilities for
and against.
Being human himself, he left no
offence without punishment,...
...nor friendship without reward.
ln short, he wast a king
who lived and died...
...leaving a majestic model
a trace of honour,...
...and his glorious fame forever.''
