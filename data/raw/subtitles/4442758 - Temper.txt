Remove the handï
,And then l became quite
determined to become police.,
,They said l should
study to become police.,
,l don,t have parents like
other for studying in school.,
,That,s why l worked during
the day and joined night school.,
,l wouldn,t study properly
but l want to become police.,
,l would see how luxurious
it is if l become policeman.,
Wrong route and moreover.
We can take Rs. 100
if there is no licence.
We can take half from the thief.
lf two people fight then
we can take from both.
Not only these,
we can trample anyone.
l used to practice dialogues too
by watching police movies at times.
,ln the neighbourhood
of this Kondaveeti...,
,...rogue like person who
commits crimes and atrocities...,

,lf there are bombs in your
house then l have guts inside me.,
,lf there is money in your pocket
then l have revolver in my pocket.,
,lf you take out this revolver
then it is illegal.,
,lf l take it out then it is legal.,
,lf you kill a person
then is called killing.,
,lf l kill then it is protection.,
,lf you twirl your moustache

,...and if l twirl moustache

and go to centre? Readyï,

At which centre shall we fight?,

,Somehow l worked hard
and passed tenth standard.,
Heyï
Degree became very difficult after that.
,At one stage, l thought of giving up.,
,But every scam happening
in the country would inspire me.,
,l would feel sad by thinking
l am not there in it.,
,l wouldn,t sleep at nights by thinking
when l will grow and become police.,
Brother, l am unable to study.
They say it will take another five
years to finish degree. What to do?
Study. lf you work hard and study,
you will learn.
- What if l work hard and buy?
- What?
l will pay money and buy degree.
,Finally l bought the degree
by taking help from few people.,
,Only physical test l passed genuinely.,
,Finally, either because of
my good luck or your bad luck...,

lt will take five minutes to kill him.
But they will bring another
strict officer if he gets killed.

Look, remove him and replace
him with the Sl who listens to me.
He shouldn,t have morality. He shouldn,t
know what honesty and sincerity.

- Heyï Heyï Heyï
- Welcome, sir.
- What are you doing here?
- Musical program.
Musical program in brothel house?
- ls it brothel house?
- Ohï
- l didn,t know.
- So what did you think?
Sir, l thought music class.
They called up and
offered good payment.
l came searching address using GPRS.
l didn,t know it is a brothel house.
Anyway, is this the location where
romantic people and drunkards come?
Ohï What do you think of us?
- Sir.
- How do we look? How do we look?
- Don,t you know brothel house?
- No, sir.
- Don,t you know? Don,t you know brothel?
- No, sir.
Don,t you know?
- Don,t you know club dance?
- No, sir.
Don,t you know?
Rascalï You are doing the sameï
ln the last night raid
in brothel house...
...a flutist by name Vennela Kishore
was caught red handed.
The culture association
responded immediately...
...and banned his musical programs
all over the state.
Rascalï Had l trusted you
and got my daughter married to you...
...my daughter,s life
would have been destroyed.
Forget what has happened?
l think he is your to-be son-in-law.
You don,t worry.
l will see that no cases are filed.
You get your daughter married to him.
What should l do? l thought he
will sing solo songs with my daughter.
How do l know he likes
group songs and item songs?
Aunt, you are getting it wrong.
They have called me.
They said they will give good payment
if l do solo performance.
- Will they make payment to you in return?
- Yes.
What is the payment made at midnight?
- Aunt, it is not that.
- Who is your aunt?
- Relaxï
- Heyï Listen to what he says.
- Leave it, mom.
- What should l listen to?
l listened to you and
agreed for this marriage.
You said he is very good. Now see.
Aunt, l am a good person.
Hey, if you call me aunt again then
l,ll make you bite with dogs. Be carefulï
- Aunt.
- No, sir.. You?
You will not ruin your life by getting
your daughter married to him, right?
- You have clarity?
- Absolutely.
- You leave.
- Sir, it is not that.
- My fiancée, sir.
- Leaveï
- Sanvi, l will call and tell you..
- What will you call?
Sanvi, l will tell everything
that happened.
What will you convince here?
l will kill you
if you are seen near her.
- Goï
- Sir, it is not that.
lf you again stop or meet her,
you will die.
Anyway why do you get married to
the person who beats dogs with stones?
What? Does he beat dogs with stones?
Yesï He wakes up the
sleeping dog and beats it.
My blood boils by watching his deeds.
Do you like dogs so much?
Like?
l was born in the midst of dogs,
l grew up with dogs...
...l worked in dogs, chemist.
What do you think a dog is?
Only dog loves us unconditionally.
lt loves human,s
more than fellow dogs.
Leave all that. We even search
for dogs in humans. Do you know?
Dog like husband who obeys his husband...
...dog like wife who takes her
husband,s abuses.
Dog like driver, dog like maid.
Whether we are at home or not, dog like
old woman like her who guards the house.
These are not sufficient
and so we bring another dog.
Sanvi, humans don,t need humanity.
They need dog,s behaviour.
,Dog,s behaviourï Dog,s behaviourï,
Look, if l were to marry...
...l will become a dog to my wife...
...and l will turn my wife into a dog.
Yesï
,,l fell on the spot
after watching you.,,
,,l forgot myself on the spot.,,
,,l fell on the spot
after watching you.,,
,,l forgot myself on the spot.,,
,,Like some magic
happened on the spot.,,
,,l fell for your words on the spot.,,
,,What have you done to me?,,
,,l don,t understand it at any cost.,,
,,You killed me by pulling and pinching
my heart.. you made me love you.,,
,,One more time,
baby, one more time.,,
,,Tell the same word one more time.,,
,,One more time,
baby, one more time.,,
,,Tell the same word one more time.,,
,,One more time.,,
,,On the spot.,,
Yesterday Ceylon Subbarao came,
so l asked him.
He says there is only two hours difference
is there between them and us.
Grandmother,
that was before Korea got split.
Timings have changed
after they got split.
- So why did Subbarao tell me like that?
- What does Ceylon Subbarao know?
He went to Ceylon. l went to Korea.
Tell him to meet me once.
l will tell him Korea timings.
Oh Godï Why does he shout like this?
Why doesn,t he tell that slowly?
,,You have hurt me with your eyes.,,
,,You have gestured with
lips and disturbed my sleep.,,
,,My heart played swinging with you.,,
,,Oh dear, l liked you in many ways.,,
,,l fell on the spot
after watching you.,,
,,l forgot myself on the spot.,,
Sir, for how many days
should l come like this?
l am shouting daily saying
my daughter is missing.
But no police is reacting.
Who is Arun?
Who is Arun?
My daughter,s friend.
They study together.
- Where he stays?
- He stays at Gajuwaka.
His house is behind
Yellamma temple in Gajuwaka.
He too is missing from
the day your daughter is missing.
Do you understand what happened?
Your daughter eloped with him.
They will return once his money and
your daughter,s jewellery are spent.
Goï
They shout unnecessarily at police
but don,t know to look after children.
We will inform after finding.
- Hello.
- Friend.
- Tell me the matter.
- His name is Thota Venkat Rao.
He has a mangrove.
l want it. l tried by threatening him.
He acted in haste and
informed the collector.
My work should be done.
Murthy, take out the vehicle.
When did you buy the property, sir?
- 25 years ago.
- Ohï
- How much it costed at that time?
- Two lakhs.
- Sir, what is the price in market now.
- lt is around five crores.
Ohï lt has increased a lot.
Wonderfulï Goodï
So why are you not selling
when Voltaire Vasu is asking?
He threatened many
times to sell for 50 lakhs.
Anyway l don,t have
any intention to sell.
l have kept it for my granddaughter.
Sir, your son will give
to your granddaughter.
Why do you take that tension?
My son and daughter-in-law
died in accident.
Only l am there for my granddaughter.
But why does Voltaire Vasu say papers
are with him and plot belongs to him.
Sir, original papers are with me.
But he too is showing
original papers, sir.
lf he goes to court by carrying
them then you too should go.
Will this matter get
settled anytime soon?
Will your granddaughter enjoy
the money from this property?
Listen to me.
He is saying he will give 50, sign it.
Sir, this costs five crores.
Sir, is it important than
your granddaughter,s life?
Five crores?
You know how big fool he is.
What if he kidnaps the
girl and keeps her somewhere?
What if he kills her?
Sir, why should we take these tensions?
Sign it.
Sir, understand what l am saying.
Sign it.
Sir, someone has kidnapped the girl.
Didn,t l tell you? Didn,t l tell you
that something like this will happen?
Sir, they will kill the girl.
lf something happens to the girl
then neither you nor l can save her.
Why do you need the property
that will kill your granddaughter?
Listen to me and sign it.
Murthy, give the paper.
Sign it, sir. Sign.
Sir, please understand
what l am saying.
Let us save the girl. Sign it.
Cheating, sir... lnjustice, sir.
Sir, how did you feel
like cheating the old man?
ls this is not called a cold
blooded murder then what is it, sir.
Sir, don,t you feel anything?
- Don,t you have conscience?
- l have saved.
Otherwise they would have killed.
ln return l got 50 lakhs for him.
There is one such angle, Murthy.
Why don,t you think?
Ohï ls there a reason
to your foolish deeds?
Sir, this is not correct.
You are committing mistake.
Being a police officer,
for a loafer.
You are supporting Voltaire Vasu.
l am seeing from childhood.
He is a big criminal.
lsn,t it? You are seeing him, right?
You know he is a criminal.
You and he are staying
here since 25 years.
So why don,t you kill him?
Take the gun. Go and shoot him.
What will happen to you in return?
You will get hanged.
Die. The justice that
you believe in will survive.
lf you can do it then do.
Otherwise shut up and keep quiet.
Don,t shout unnecessarily.
Stay on that side or this side.
People like you who stay in between
are not of any benefit to the country...
...or your family, Murthyï
Justice, honesty, country,
patriotism... stop the nuisanceï
Learn to count
how many bundles of...
...500 and 1000 currency notes
are there in that bag.
Ughï lt is illegal moneyï
l will not touch it.
Look... look,
this is your note and this is mine.
This is justice and this is injustice.
Here... l have crushed them together.
Tell meï Tell meï
Tell me which is your note and mine.
Tell me, Murthyï
Murthy, the honesty inside
you is not there in this note.
Don,t shoutï
The first witness for every injustice
that happens in the country.
They have kept..
they have kept a photo on this.
Here... keep it... keep it and...
- ...take that bag home.
- l don,t want.
Okay, you are my bank.
l am depositing them with you. Keep it.
Heyï lt will be good
if a tsunami comes...
...and you get drowned.
lt will be good if you dieï
Callï Call... call which
tsunami you will call... callï
Pray to the God you worship.
l will sit here all nightï
Yesï Tell the tsunami to come.
l will take it.
Murthy, it will not
come for me specially.
When it comes, you, me...
...Voltaire Vasu, old man,
his granddaughter and everyone will die.
lt has no confusions like you and me.
lt has more clarity.
lt will come, drown us and carry us.
Tsunami? Tsunami.
l will sit here. Tell it comeï
Why doesn,t it come?
You are talking as
if l committed rapes or murders.
Why do you join the
department for nuisance.
Father.
Today is the last day.
lf l don,t pay the fees then
they will not allow me to write exams.
They will remove me from college.
Use that money if you need anything.
l will not feel anything.
- How much has to be paid?
- 40,000.
Dear, your father doesn,t
have so much money.
Why should you wait till
they remove you? You quit college.
You quit college.
All the police families are doing well.
Only we are crying like this.
Mother,s bad luck. You are born to a
father who couldn,t educate his daughter.
People like you who stay in between
are not of any benefit to the country...
...or your family, Murthy.
Heyï
Hiï
- Happy birthdayï
- Thank you.
Tell me. Ask me what you want.
Will anyone ask like that?
You should give something.
What should l give?
lf you don,t like what l give you now
then where should l keep it.
These saris and all...
l can,t do all that.
Mobiles? TV's? Electronic gadgets?
Tell me anything from these smuggled
items. They will come in five minutes.
l will ask if l want.
But please don,t take
me in police jeep today.
Please. lt is minimum
common sense to bring a bike...
...when you take your
girl friend to movie.
Correct... correct... correct...

Why don,t l stop someone?
He is correct.
Heyï Stopï Stopï Stopï Stopï Policeï

Talking of chase?
Hey, come to the station

- Use my vehicle.
Use my jeep... use it nicely.

- Sit, madam. Sit.
Hey, fill the tank and
return in the evening... enjoy.
Full tank?
Who is he?
There are dogs in
your department, right?
They are very trained
and intelligent, right?
Hmm.
We asked many times. They didn,t give.
Our dogs are to be bred.
Will you arrange for it?
lt has been long time...
nobody cares for us.
lf dogs need it, you ask it decently.
When we ask for it,
they look at us like dogs.
Let us set something.
Don,t know this world.
- Which shop you want?
- What for?
- For frying and eating.

You wait.
Hey, tell me which fishes you have.

Sanvi, you don,t take any tension.
Tell your family members
that you fell down from bike.
Don,t fear.
Go and sleep.
When did you come? What happened?
l couldn,t sleep all night.
lt happened by mistake. Forget it.
They tried to kill me by thinking
of me to be some other girl.
But had they killed.
What would have happened to you?
My mother, grandmother and our life..
what would have happened.
Nothing happened now.
Forget it as a nightmare.
What if the girl they
are looking for is found?
They will kill her, isn,t it?
She has a life.
She must be having a family, right?
lt is a mistake to kill a person, right?
l couldn,t sleep all night
by thinking of that girl.
l have been crying.
Daya, l don,t know who that girl is.
But she should live.
You should save her
as a sincere police officer.
Her life is the birthday
gift that you will give me.
Sanviï
He is a friend and she is girl friend.
l don,t know the
girl whom l should save.
Where are you?
Why are you here?
l told you to come
to the guest house, right?
Keep this gun with you.
lf anybody comes closer, shoot them.
Heyï Heyï
Why are you giving the gun to her?
Because of this girl,
your girl friend was beaten.
- Leave this girlï
- What?
Leave this girl, brother.
Why? ls she too your girl friend?
lf something happens to her
then my love will become a problem.
Problem only to your love.
lf l leave her then
it is a problem to my life.
Heyï Bring herï
Heyï What is this angle?
Didn,t l tell not to touch?
Why did you show a new angle?
There are many more angles.
Ohï Hey, there are
four dogs in my farm house.
l give them pedigree and money to you.
That is the only difference.
Will you answer back to me?
You have touched the wrong point.
Didn,t l already tell you

Wifi is on. Turn it off.

lf two people fight with me then
it is war. lf one attacks alone...

Yesï Come onï
Did l stop there? Noï

Will he not get hurt?
Attackï This is Daya,s attack.

24 hours are over, sir.
Shall we talk?
Tell me. Where is the girl?
- Why do you want that girl?
- To play hopscotch,
Hey, you don,t seem to understand
the seriousness in matter.
You must be thinking that you will
save her because your girl friend asked.
My brothers, lives..
Look, she has got a proof with her.
lf it is leaked then
lives of my brothers will end.
- What did your brothers do?
- Why do you want all that?
Tell me where the girl is?
l should kill her.
What is the need to kill
her for taking the proof?
You want girl or proof?
Proof.
l will bring that proof.
- Will you leave her?
- Will she give you?
lf she trusts anybody on
this earth now then it is me.
l will bring. Leave her.
My situation too is the same.
lf l trust anybody
in this earth then...
...it is only you.
My brothers, lives...
l am leaving by trusting you.
- Murthy, take out the vehicle.
- Sir, what you are doing is wrong.
Cheating, sir. Don,t cheat that girl.
Stop, Murthyï Don,t irritate me.
Do as l say.
ls your fear lost?
You are crying since the time you came
but you are not telling what happened.
What happened? Who are they?
lf you trust me that l will
remove your problem then tell me.
l work in New York.
Mother and sister stay here.
l came to lndian to see them.
Sister should have come
to the airport to receive me...
...she didn,t come.
Don,t know what happened.
Mother and l searched extensively.
We didn,t know her whereabouts.
One day we received a call.
Sister, l don,t know whether l will
stay alive or not by the time you come.
- Where are you?
- Don,t know.
l was coming to the airport for you...
...brothers of Voltaire
Vasu brought me here.
Sister, l have seen hell.
They said they will kill me today.
Kill you?
What are you talking, Deepti?
Sister, you don,t know.
Death is much better
than these people.
They had shot everything
in video camera.
l have seen them keeping
that CD in lorry.
Phone too is not mine.
l am sending GPS.
Heyï Whom are you calling?
After that l went to
the address sent by Deepti.
Deeptiï
They killed my sister, sir.
Sir, Vasu,s brothers have
raped and killed my sister.
l trusted a media person by mistake...
...and told about the CD.
He is Voltaire Vasu,s man.
He cheated me.
After that l got
frightened to tell anybody.
And then you saved me.
- Does mother have American Visa?
- Yes.
Then give me the CD and
go to America with mother.
Do you trust me? Do you trust me?
- l trust you.
- Come, let us go home.
Don,t tell this matter to mother.
She doesn,t know anything.
She says police told her
that Deepti eloped with some boy.
Mother believes it.
Sir, my daughter is
missing from four days.
Sir, did you get any
information about my Deepti?
Take mother inside.
Come, mother. There is an urgent
call from office asking to come.
We should leave for
America immediately.
America? Now?
Yes.
Hello. Book two business
class tickets to America urgently.
l am sending both mother
and daughter there.
Hey... CD... what happened to the CD?
First book the tickets. CD will come.
Why are you watching like that?
Murthy, why are you
looking at me with disgust?
l am sending mother and
daughter to America safely.
From there l will go and
give the CD to Voltaire Vasu.
This is what is doing to happen.
Murthy, nobody can give
a better solution to this problem.
Stop watching like that.
What? Why do you
look at me with disgust?
Didn,t l tell you
not to watch like that?
You go. First you go to station.
Don,t stand in front of my eyes. Goï
Goï
Okay, Sanvi.
No problem. Entire problem is solved.
l am sending Laxmi
and her mother to America.
- ls she next to you?
- Yes, one minute.
Hi, Laxmi. Happy journey.
Thank you, Sanvi.
Okay, listen. Give your American
number to him. l will call you again.
- Tell me.
- Did she give the CD?
Not yet.
Take it immediately
and come to the guest.
Okay.
- Laxmi, call me after reaching New York.
- Okay.
lt is..
you said you will give some CD.
We are going to America.
l think Deepti might come home.
Tell her that l am not angry.
l will tell her.
l think you are late. Go.

brother.
-Supun@zoom.lk-
See that CD once, brother.
Don,t spare them easily.
They should get punished

Entire country should know.
lf anybody tries to do it
again then should be die out of fear.
Brother, who have the freedom
for these animals to roam free...
...on roads in my country.
Brother, don,t spare such people.
My conscience says justice

Why do you join the
department for no reason?

Why did you bring the CD here?
Sir, l think it is Voltaire Vasu.
Will you talk?
Why are you like that, sir?
What happened?
Sir, you are shedding tears.
l never saw you like that.
What happened, sir?
Something happened
in the airport, sir.
What happened, sir?
lf nothing happened...
...then the vehicle should

Why did it come to the station?
lf nothing happened then the
CD that should be in his hands...

why are you not taking his call?
Sir, something is hitting meï

Mr. Murthy?
Sir, did you remember
my age after so many days?
Sir, since when did you start
thinking of neighbour,s family?
Sir, this is called change.
You have changedï
Sir, you have changedï

l don,t know how much you struggled while
taking birth from your mother,s womb...
...but in order to born from within...
...you are struggling a lot.
Sir, you are struggling a lot.
Sir, l am saying you have changed...
...and you say you didn,t change..
debate is unnecessary.
They will say it.
lf those rascals go out

But only if their bodies go out...

Sir, l will sit there and watch.

Sirï We were on touch

He told me to book two business class
tickets. He said he will bring the CD.
Now she shouted something and left.
What did he say, sir?
He said it very clearly.
He said his mother had
a child so he couldn,t come.
He should be with her
when the child is born, right?
You are talking of CD since long time.
lf it is so important then
why did you give it to him?
- Who gave him Ministry?
- What?
He has cheated usï
He is not our man. He has changed.
You brought him and

Ohï ls it? Who did it, sir?
lt is natural for rowdies

Anger? l wanted to give

...l didn,t think how to live.
Sir, l don,t even know how l lived.
Sir, l committed a mistake.

But now l have changed, Sanvi.
You are the reason behind that change.
l am this.
Your wish after that.
Who told you to tell the truth?
You didn,t tell me

You told me when
there is no need to do.
Now l am in confusion.
Will you stay with me or not?
Actually l should leave you.
Since you said that my contribution
is major behind your change...

They are showing Deepti,s
dead body again and again.
Mother collapsed after seeing it.
Severe heart attack.

Mother, l am there.

We want justiceï We want justiceï
Sir, they have brutally
raped and killed Deepti.
This has become a
big issue in the country.
Whole lndia is waiting
for your judgement.
Please do justice to Deepti,
your honourï
Produce the evidence.
What is this? The one
which you submitted as proof.
That CD is empty.
There is no data in it.
ls this your proof?
There was data in the
CD when we produced it.
Your honour,
there has been some manipulation.
Sir, court doesn,t want ifs and buts.
lt wants evidence and truth.
By keeping a blank CD and
wasting the time of court...
...they have framed my clients,
who are innocent, in a dangerous case.
lt is a clear cut case, your honour.
l request the court to identify
my clients as not guilty...
...and release them.
Sir, did you sell it?
Did you sell the CD?
For how much you sold it?
Orderï Orderï
Due to lack of evidence...
...we declare these
four people as not guilty..
Sir, l have proof with me.
What proof you have?
You take one day,s time.
l have proof with me.
lt is not that...
you don,t seem to understand it.
lt will become a big problem
if you extend the case...
...and don,t produce any proof.
Sir, you take one day,s
time by trusting me.
l will definitely submit it.
Your honour, there is evidence.
l asked for one day,s
time to produce it.
l object your honour.
Until now they said CD and
now they are saying some proof.
Our clients have already
faced lot of damage.
Entire country is thinking
that my clients are accused.
Your honour,
it is not good to extend this case.
One day extension granted.
- Noï
- The court is adjourned.
Evidence goes missing in the court,
Deepti,s case postponed for tomorrow.
By the way, what is there with him?
Did he say something?
However l ask him,
he is not telling me.
There is something with him.
Otherwise he won,t look so confident.
Should l tell the truth?
l don,t have any proof with me.
What is it? But you said you
will submit in the court tomorrow.
Had l not said like that
then they would have been left.
How did the CD get exchanged?
Sanvi, don,t l know this corruption?
All these years l believed that...
...l am the worst guy in department
and others are very good.
By believing it, l took that CD
and gave it to the lawyer.
Had l been like before then
l would have made many copies of it.
- What about tomorrow?

Where is the proof?
Your honour, l am the proof.

Did you see those four people...
...raping Deepti?
Not four people, your honourï
Five people have raped
and killed Deeptiï
Fifth one is nobody but meï
We five people have kidnapped herï
Heyï Are you mad?
We five people have
tortured her badlyï
Sir, he is telling liesï
Sir, we had pierced her with needles,
we had cut her with blades.
Not one or two, your honourï
We showed her hell for 40 daysï
Sir, she would request us to kill herï
We all would feel happy
when she asked like that.
Sir, we are sadist roguesï
lsn,t it?
- Hey, psychoï
- Sir, he is telling liesï
- Sir, he is telling liesï
- Orderï Orderï
lf you are one of them then
why did you file case on them?
Sir, l asked for money.
They didn,t give it.
Sir, we fell out with each other.
l decided to do black mail to them.
l lied to them saying l have a CD.
They didn,t believe it.
l filed the case.
They feared and escaped.
You all came to know that l have
kept a blank CD in court yesterday.
But still l lied saying
l have another proof.
Sir, they tried to get me killed
last time. They beat me very badly.
They left me by thinking l died.
Sir, when l was on
the verge of death...
...l understood the
hell that girl experienced.
l started repenting.
l should have died,
l thought why am l alive.
Millions of people..
temple like court.
God like you.
Sir, l felt l stayed alive
for telling the truth to you all.
Sir, even now too this
rascal tried to buy me...
...on the staircase outside the court.
Sir, l don,t want money now.
l want truth.
Sir, we all committed
big crime on Deepti.
Don,t spare us.
Sir, actually we were not
supposed to kidnap Deepti that day.
lt was your granddaughter Sandhyaï
You don,t feel like believing it, right?
Sandhya, sir.
Gitam,s college,
studying in second year.
She goes to tuition to Gajuwaka daily.
ln fact we planned to trap
your granddaughter Sandhya, sir.
We had fixed it, sir.
Recce was done.
Exactly on the day of kidnapping...
...Sandhya didn,t come.
Deepti was found. l said no.
But Mani didn,t agree, sir.
- Sirï Sirï He is telling lies.
- Let us kidnap Deepti...
...is she not a woman?
We will see Sandhya later.
He said all this, sir.
Sirï Sirï He is telling utter lies.
Sir, he is telling lies.
Sir, l think on Thursday or Friday...
...we came again for Sandhya.
But Sandhya was not there.
She went to Guntur.
l think to your brother,s house.
l think he lives there.
Didn,t you fear while
committing such crime?
Fear for what, sir? What will you do?
Maximum punishment will
be life imprisonment.
Sir, if not this court
then another court.
There are hundreds of sections..
there are hundreds of tricks.
Sir, we are able to rape
a girl immediately after seeing her.
Are you able to punish immediately?
Leave all that, sir.
We accept that we committed mistake.
Will you be able to
hang us in a day or two?
lt never happened anytime in lndia...
...so how can we hang you within
two days, you will say this.
Sir, there are already 52 prisoners
in this country who got hanged.
lf you delay in hanging
them then by the time...
...our number comes,
it will be 25 years later.
There will countless Sandhya,s
and Deepti,s by that time.

this country very much.

provides this kind of freedom.
