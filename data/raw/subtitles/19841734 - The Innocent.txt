I'll explain to you how it works.
Place the charger
in this direction.
Not otherwise.
- Otherwise, it might blow up in your face.
- Ok, I get it.
Did you understand?
Your life is worth
less than the life of a
chicken, because
you don't deserve it.
His death, on the contrary,
he certainly deserved.
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
If he killed only one man,
he tied with his own death.
His death will leave no trace.
It's like he's not dead.
You have to kill two to win.
With two men murdered,
then you start to leave a trace.
A little bit more.
Anyway,
no one can kill you twice.
- This activity ended for today.
- OK.
- Head for the exit...
- It was great!
- I forgot a sentence.
- It doesn't matter, it was great!
- Congratulations, congratulations, Michel!
- True?
- Congratulations, Gerald.
- Did you feel the undercurrent?
- Yes.  Do you agree?
- I believed.
If you understood what was not said.
It had life.
Are you kidding me, you.
You will be an actor.
Wow!  Congratulations!
Next week I will
have a little problem.
- What is it?
- I have to report to the judge.
- What does he want?
- It's to reduce my sentence.
My parole.
He talks about 5 to 6 months.
Guys, a little faster.
- That's great, Michael.
- AND.
I won't be able to
finish the play with you.
It doesn't hurt.
Love you.
- See you later.
- See you later.
Sometimes we can't change, but
we can change things around us.
I don't know, traveling,
moving, changing professions.
Because there are
moments in life, I'm not saying
that many, there are moments
when we have to decide.
I'm not saying it's
an easy thing to do.
When you're 30 or 50,
it's always a challenge.
Are you talking
about me, or you?
No, I speak in general.
No one speaks in general.
It's a retard thing.
It's not retarded.  For
example, in general, I am alone.
- AND.
- But now I'm not.
AND?
And who is it?
Where did you find it?
His name is Michael.
- Where did you find him?
- You'll like him very much.
Hey, where did you find it?
- Where did you find him?
- In jail.
- This is a problem?
- What is it, why did you stop?
Why the irritation?
What are you doing?
- It's him.
- Why are you accelerating?
He's in the van.  It's Michel.
- What?
- It's going to the judge.
For conditional.
- What's that?  Go slow!
- Michael!
No!  Slowly!  I do not like it.
Michael!  Look, it's Abel.
He is my son!
What's that?  He can't see!
Hang on.  He can't
see us, but he can hear.
- My love!  My love!
- You've gone crazy!
Stop!  No no!
- Michael!  Michael!
- Slowly.  No mother!
Mom, I don't like this!
Stop!  They'll arrest us,
everything will go wrong!
They cannot stop when
transporting a prisoner.
Stop!  Stop the fuck!
We're going to have trouble.
Sir?  Sir?
My love is there in that van.
Stop!  Stop, I want to get off.
She went completely crazy!
- I can't stop here!
- Crazy!  Are you listening to me?
- I'm your mother!
-Screw it, she's crazy.
A complete freak.
THE INNOCENT
This can?
- Do not use in hallways.
- Right.
Mrs.  Sylvie Lefranc, née
Beltoise, accepts as her husband
Mr.  Michel Ferrand
present here?
Yes!  Yes.
Mr.  Michel Ferrand,
takes Mrs.  Sylvie Lefranc,
born Beltoise, present here?
Yes.
Upon your free and mutual
responses, we declare you in
the name of the law united
by the bonds of matrimony.
Congratulations!
- You are my wife.
- Yes.
Abel, the photos, now.
No, take it from us.
He is silly.
Ready.
Could you take a
picture of us all together?
Don't want to come too?
Come, please.  Come on.
Okay, move closer.
Yeah, a little bit over there.
A little more.
Attention, on the 3.
One, two, and three.
There!
Come on, ladies and
gentlemen, it's over now.
Guard, please come.
Accompany Michel to the cell.
Am I entitled to the flowers?
Why...
No, flowers cannot
go to detention.
I will accompany the family.
Will you come see me?
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
Maybe not tomorrow, but...
Come on, see you soon.
Say goodbye now.
Thanks.  Abel...
See you later.
- Faster, ladies and gentlemen.
- Yes yes.
Bye friend.  Until later.
It wasn't that sad, was it?
Even the guards looked happy.
After all, everyone
was happy except you.
Fortunately, I had prevented it.
- Prevented what?
- That you would look like a funeral.
And that he is the third in 10
years, did you forewarn him?
That's chic.
It's not a prison
anymore, it's a dating club.
Will you be able to
sleep alone tonight?
Yes, why?
After all, it's your
wedding night.
All good.
Go, good night.
- My son.
- Kisses.
Now we see a particular specimen
that I really like, called an axolotl.
The axolotl is a small
animal that lives in Mexican
lakes, usually located at
an altitude of 2,000 meters.
It is an exemplary case of
what science calls neoteny.
What is neoteny?
It is the conservation
of juvenile
characteristics in the
adults of the species.
That is, the axolotl would grow
its entire life in the larval state.
He can also regenerate
entire sectors of his organs.
If the tail is cut off, he
is able to make it grow,
or renew your hands, regenerate
entire parts of the
brain, so scientists
the scientists...
study them a lot
to try to see what
applications medicine
could discover
of the functioning
of the axolotl.
AND...
And that.  I'll let them
look at it, enjoy it,
and I hope he makes
them laugh like I did.
Good morning, the visit is over.
Sorry.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'm in my 2nd year of
oceanography and I love your exhibits.
- Did you give her your number?
- No, I didn't.
- She didn't give hers?
- Don't stuff it!
- But it's you who fills me up!
- Go to!
- She had a nice ass, didn't she?
- Too much!  I didn't look, I don't know!
- See?  He surrendered.
- No...
- Nice legs?
- Very beautiful.
- And smart air?
- No!  Yes!
He offered a book
about Lake Xochimilco.
Be good, see?
They will steal your dog.
That's not enough.
If they want to take
a bite out of the bag.
See the collar?
It's connected to my cell phone.
I know where he is.
I can even hear everything.
- AND?
- They didn't have the size.
This one isn't bad, is it?
- AND.
- I will try.
- Your ass grew, did it?
- Yes, why?  Wasn't it good?
Yes, it was good.  It's better.
How long have you not...
- No what?
- No... No!
What not what?
That you didn't download?
- That didn't download!
- I heard.  Everyone heard it now.
But you do not.
He did not answer.
I'm not like you.
I don't do that with everyone.
You wanted Maud's
permission, did you?
I give you the authorization.
She would agree.
- What do you know about it?
- She's my best friend.
I know, Clemence.  Sorry.
Still have a Tinder
date tonight?
I have.
I'm super excited.
I feel like this time it's him.
I hope you don't go
straight to his house.
Of course not, go ahead.
He's the one who sleeps at my house.
Watch your eyes.
- What do you think?
- Yes it's great.
Do I take a number below?
My mom's guy worries me.
- Isn't it tight?
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, it's tight.
- Do not buy.
- True?  Did you like it?
- Yes.
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.
He won't come anymore.
I don't know.
- There he is.
- Hey.
- Hi Michel.
- All good?
All.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It doesn't hurt, none.
- There it is, it's Michel.
- I know, of course.
- All good?
- Fine and you?
Yes, everything is fine.
- How long have you been out?
- One week.
One week.
And how long were you there?
- I...
- How long were you there?
Well... yeah, 5 years.
5 years in prison?
- What is it?  Is it a Rolex?
- AND.
False?  TRUE?
- Is not true.
- AND?
- Did you like it?
- Yes it's pretty.
Beautiful, isn't it?
I give it to you as a gift.
- No, are you crazy?  What's that?
- Take it.
- No, I won't keep your Rolex.
- Do not refuse.  I'm ashamed.
Is a pleasure.  I was glad
to meet you again.  It's a gift.
- No...
- Abel, let's not start like that.
Abel, keep it simple.
It's a pleasure for me, really.
I love you.
For example, if you had
to strike, what would it be?
I don't throw punches
anymore, I don't do that anymore.
Invent.  What would it be today?
Reply.
If I had to strike today, it
would be on the margins.
- What margins?
- The animals.
- Otherwise, there's always alcohol.
- What with the alcohol?
In alcohol there is a safe value.
In 1995, with two friends, we
stole two Ricard tank trucks,
and since we had
the Lion bar circuit...
- Why the 5 years in prison?
- What's with that?
It doesn't matter, let it go.
Not everyone
finds an ex-prisoner.
He finds yes.
Yes.
We found many.
Together with my
mother, I found many.
How much education!
What are you going
to do now to survive?
Temporary job.
I start tomorrow at Conforama.
What will you do there?
In prison you lift dumbbells.
Now he will lift sofas.
I'm going for a walk.
- Did I say something silly?
- None.
Was it me who made you run away like that?
No no.
What happened to your wife?
Why ask?  Did my mother tell?
She told.
Were you the one
driving when it happened?
Improved?
I didn't feel bad.
Say...
- Let's show him, what do you think?
- Let's go.
Ready.
- Here it is.
- AND?  What?
It's our store.
- What?
- It's our store.
Over there, look,
there will be the cashier.
I'll take care of the cashier.
There will be a
large table to cut
the flowers to
assemble bouquets.
There, let's enjoy...
the window to place all
the more classic flowers,
tulips, begonias, which
need a lot of light...
I'm not understanding anything.
- What do we do here?
- You can see it, can't you?
Let's open a flower shop.
- Is this a joke?
- No.
What did you think?  That we stole
the key to the store to scare you?
- I'm not afraid.
- I hope you're not afraid.
We are talking about tulips and
begonias, nothing to be afraid of.
- Who does this belong to?
- Years.
It's in the center of the city.
What did you pay for it?
- Explain why...
- It was a great opportunity.
The owner is a friend.
He leased it to us
for a third of the price.
In exchange, he will get
a percentage of the profit.
And who is this guy?
Can you let us talk, real quick?
- Yes of course.
- Right.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
You live among your fish,
I can live among flowers.
What guy is this?...
Abel, what is your
problem in life?
It's because when a
problem appears, and it will,
and as always you
will come after me.
How crazy.
You suspect everything!
I don't suspect.
You scare me!
Did you understand?  You scare me.
- I'm happy...
- Keep it down.
I am happy and I am afraid of you.
That's not my problem.
Can't be conservative
in what you do?
Make a loan?
Stop playing actress.
If you want to open a store...
Let's divide the debt in half.
With what?  Just got out of jail.
Go work at Conforama.
What will you pay?
It's a worker.
If you weren't my son, I'd
think you were an asshole.
You always said it was better for
them to be locked up than loose.
It's not a scoop.
Put yourself in his shoes.
POLICE STATION
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I came to introduce myself.
Michael Ferrand.
Michael Ferrand.
Thanks.
Michael Ferrand.
Hello boss.
- How are you?
- All good?
- Yes.  Nice to see you.  - AND.
- And be free?
- It is good.
Are you enjoying?
Does the store go ahead?
- He knows everything.
- It's my job.
- My best wishes.
- Cool, thanks.
I thought it was
very chic, explaining
to customers the
symbology of colors.
- AND.
- The pink, for example.
- It's the tenderness.
- That reminds me of grandpa
who offered me a huge bouquet
on the way out of a theater.
- The yellow roses...
- He was touching.
The yellow roses, dear, is joy.
It's happiness,
friendship, for example.
It was in a theater.
I don't know where
it was anymore,
but it was so
beautiful and I loved it.
For example, tulips are pride.
AND?
You are scarring me.
- Why?
- Because I can see well.
You pretend, but this store
doesn't interest you at all.
- But I'm not pretending.
- It is.
- I love this store.
- No.
- Yes.
- I see.
- Understand nothing.
- You'll miss being an actress.
I no longer want to
be an actress at all.
I feel like opening the
flower shop with you.
Hey!  I'm in love with you.
I've never loved anyone this much.
AND...
That's what they always say.
"The others meant nothing."
But we know this is not true.
Yes, it's true what
I'm telling you.
Everything I tell you is true.
Believe me, trust me.
However, it's not easy.
- What is not easy?
- No, it's not easy.
Why isn't it easy?
I don't know.
Maybe you wanted a
woman younger than me.
A woman younger than you?
What kind of guy
do you think I am?
What's wrong today?
Do you think it's
easy to be with you?
What did I do?
There are much more interesting
men than I who interest you.
I know that.
And that's not easy either.
Listen, Michael.
I was a screwed up woman.
And you are my chance at life.
Please stop.
Please stop.  Stop.
- Is it the same guy you saw the other day?
- No.
There are many, perhaps.
Maybe it's a real mafia.
-Your mother knows what she does.
- No, she's naive.
He's going to use the
place to launder money.
You want him to launder
money transporting sofas?
Whatnot.
- I'll tell you what I think.
- Take it.
How is this used?  Like this.
Which one is it?
The one who wears a black turtleneck.
Did you see him?
- Damn!
- What it was?
- He is handsome.
- Not that.  What did you feel?
- Sylvie!
- Stop this!
She surprises me.
She makes you want to grope that ass.
- Stop!  He arrives!
- I understand her.  I adore your mother.
I found a guy too!
- AND?
- AND!
- Same as last time?
- No.
Can I talk about the sex we had?
- No.
- Oh, go!
Quiet, put on a coat.
Where are you going?
Go eat.  They're hungry.
- Let's go to the parking lot.
- It started!
- Discreetly, slowly.
- I know what I do.
Don't get too close or too far.
Yes.
Good morning!
Can I sit down?
Sit down, of course.
Stop looking at me.
Do not look at me.
Damn, she doesn't understand anything.
That.
I have zero coke.
Coke zero with sugar.
With sugar.
Fucking hell!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you Clemence?
Yes.
- Michel Ferrand.
- Michel... wait.
- Michel, I don't think I know.
- Sylvie.
Abel's mother.
Clear!
I remembered.
It's because I've never seen you.
- Yes, yes, yes...
- We never met.
Shit!  Shit!
He's a fucking idiot!
I work up front, at Conforama.
- Same?
- And you, what are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a sofa.
- A sofa?
- Just arrive.
- Of course, of course!
- The cell phone.
- It doesn't matter.
Too bad, it's Abel, see.
Yes, wow!  I...
Hello, Abel?  How's life going?
What are you up to?
Why did you talk to him?
Look, I'm at a little restaurant
in the mall.  I'm going to buy
my sofa in a little
while and I met with...
with Michael!
True?  All good?
Is it threatening you?
Answer yes or no.
Should I go there?
Listen, we...
- see you later?
- Can I talk to him?
I'll pass it on to Michel.
He wants to talk to you.
Abel, how are you?
Are you in the car in
front of the scooter?
Than?
I don't understand Michel.
Isn't it too tight
under the dash?
Not alright.
How about stopping by the
store on Sunday to give us a hand?
It's a chance for us
to spend time together.
What do you think?
Yes, that's a good idea.
I'll pass.
Oh shit!
Careful, it will crash.
Oh, hit!
It really hit.
- Cuba!
- Hola!
I did not know you...
- Oh, go!
- I did not know that...
Socialism by death!
It's slippery.
Are you jealous?
He can dance well.  He
took a course of I don't know
what when he was little.  He
knows how to do many things.
He's no good.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
He makes me laugh.
- I do things on the floor, will not laugh.
- What kind?
Make the wave.
You will see.
Do you know what a wave is?
What do you have to say?
You can't say anything, friend.
Is that a wave?
- It looks like a worm.
- What?
Is that a wave?
- Worm what?
- I'll show you.
At least it moves,
so salsa still works.
Do you do the man or the woman?
- Hold my hand.
- OK.
- Are you going to move or not?
- Yeah, check it out.
Follow my pace.  And 1.
Back.
That!  It is good.  Is learning.
One day I'll take you to Cuba.
- Abel?
- What?
Can I ask you something?
Yes what?
Your mother...
Do you think she loves me?
I don't know.  Why?
Because you...
You know her well.  Must know.
Our...
You were the one who
married her, now what?
You should know.
Want to know if she's happy?
For example.
She is.
She is happy.  I see.
- Was that it?
- It was.
I confirm, she is happy.  Right?
That.
That's what I wanted to know.
- Very good.
- See?
I'm relieved.
Thanks.
Cool.
She bullied you, didn't she?
- Your mother.
- Yes.
I'm a bit like my
father, a bit her brother.
While wanting to be her son.
AND.
Do you have someone in life?
Yes, my wife, but she died.
- I saw.
- What did you see?
Go get the cups.
Abel?
Can you come and see?
- What there was?
- What do you think?
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes please.
Maybe it's extreme violence.
- Didn't like the pants?
- The problem is not the pants.
- The knot?
- The knot is tight.
- It's wild silk.
- No, but it makes me sick.
- If you want, I'll shoot.
- I beg you to take it off.
- What a shame.
- Do you have a tie?
Yes, but I think it's kind of pointless.
It's sinister, looks
like a burial employee.
It's not what the women
on the street tell me.  Sorry.
- Do they talk to you on the street?
- Didn't you get stuck too much?
His barber is also in prison.
This coat fits well.
Michael Ferrand.
Repeat offender, friend.
And so.
- My God!
- Clemence!
But how amazing!
You look awesome!
And you are too beautiful.
- It's a very beautiful dress.
- You think?
- I've never seen you like this.
- I'm in love.
My wife is beautiful, isn't she?
- No!
- Don't bite me!
What is that?  And not!
- Is it a pitbull?
- No, it's a staff.
- Worth a good price.
- Yeah, but I neutered him.
- Underdog.
- It's much more affectionate that way.
- What collar is this?
- A type of electronic collar.
- Do they make them for animals, too?
- Grandpa!
It is beautiful here.
My God!
It looks like a fairy tale.
Need to go.
- Jean-Paul needs help.  - No!
- Come back soon.
- Yes, I'll come back with him.
My friends!
No, Gino!
My friends!
Michel, meet my
friend from the theater.
- What it was?
- Be quiet.
- Give me the dog collar.
- Abel, don't start, damn it.
You are no longer 12 years old.
It's ridiculous.
- Your cell phone, turn on the app.
- No!
Turn on the dog app.
I will leave them.  I won't be
long, I'm going to help a friend.
No!  The staff will
arrive in half an hour.
How it works?
Excellent.
Sorry.
- All good?
- Yes.
- Will leave?
- Yeah, I'll be right back.
- Dear!
- Until later.
It's... whatever.
- It's not possible!
- All good?
- Happy to see you.
- Me too.
- You're happy for your mother.
- Very happy.
It's a new life starting.
Clémence is my best friend.
Do you know?
Jean-Claude is a
friend of my mother's,
she's known me since I was little.
He is an actor.
An actor?
Unbelievable.
What movie did you make?
I did many things...
THE WILD FLOWERS
- Why are you here?
- I'm a ceramist.
Ceramist?
- And what you do?
- Sculptor.
Are you a sculptor?
- And your husband, where is he?
- He's coming.
It's coming?
- What there was?  All good?
- All.
Damn it, he's not here.
TO LISTEN
...I'm not idiot...
It's been 6 months.
Pay 200.
In a way.  250, 200.
Stop, stop.  Hisham, I
trust him 100%, okay?
This is a fact, no
more talk about it.
Now, you and me.
Let's start over from a good base.
You tricked me again.
It doesn't hurt, thanks.
But today the base
is not the same.
I want you to rectify the shot.
Can it or not?
- Am sorry.
- I've always been honest with you.
But it's 200 thousand...
- Quiet, you!
- 130...
No, it's not a carpet sale.
You're about to send
two guys on a robbery!
We risk jail for that.
Did you understand?
Yes.  I leave.  In a repeat
offense, I get 10 years, 15 years!
Then that's it.  All I ask
is that you rectify the shot.
There were 3 times more
in the truck than you said.
It's normal for me to ask.
That's right.  I'm a producer.
I make rosettes,
Jesus, sausages.
It's a painting gallery,
paintings by Lion, contemporary,
but we also have stuff
from the 19th century, etc.
I should be at the
store with my wife.
Well, we negotiated and
I passed the store to you.
This is part of
the negotiations.
We also put loin, pork shank,
salt, pepper, garlic, sugar.
We grind, mix and put
everything in a casing...
So what are you going to do?
- I'll cut you to pieces.
- From the beginning,
he is playing with you.
I don't like being
fucked, that's all.
Is it not possible to
talk seriously, without
insulting, without provoking,
without threatening?
Every time, you do this.
Can't argue...
Oops, watch out!
- You came.
- Yes I arrived.
I was afraid he would leave
me alone with all these people.
Why?  Do you want me to leave?
How are you?
I would like to introduce
you to my beloved,
my husband and my
partner.  It's Michel.
Congratulations!  Welcome!
- Welcome!  - Welcome!
To sing veni creator You
need a golden cocoon
To sing veni creator You
need a golden cocoon
We are the weavers
We will go completely naked
- Get naked!
- Congratulations!
Thanks.
Drink, I'm going to change clothes.
Between witnesses to the marriage.
How are you my dear?
- Everything, and you?
- All.
These people drink too much,
they've run out of champagne.
- Need to talk to you.
- What it was?
It's going to get dangerous with Michel.
End this story, mother!
It needs to stop.
I will help you.
Will you stop it?  Go shut up.
There was a catastrophe with
you, but it started to fill me up.
And you will stop harming
my life, understand?
What do you want me to say?
What is this.  Your guy's jacket.
What is this?
This what?
Damn, where is the thing?
I will go crazy.
You're getting crazy.  Leaves!
I'll end up crazy.
It arrived!  The champagne!
- He had a gun in his pocket.
- What?
He had a gun in
his pocket earlier.
I followed him, he went to
a store I don't know whose.
-He's dangerous, he's lying.
- Stop!
- Stop!
- Stop what?
Please, he won't kill her.
Now, calm down.
It's his mother's life.
What are you going to do?  Leave her alone.
It won't spoil all that.
See how happy she is!  Look!
Do you know why we're here?
- No, I don't understand.
- We have a big problem.
- AND?
- He's right behind you.
Turn around and look up there.
Go.
Did you see the other asshole?
He won't do anything.
- Last time, it cost you 5 years.
- What do you think he'll do?
- Go to the police.
- I'm his mother's husband.
- He won't go to the police.
- How will I know?
- I guarantee.
- Listen, you're my friend,
but if you don't take
care of it, I'll take care of it.
- Do you know what it means.
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Accordingly.
- It's my problem.
- No problem.
- Thanks.
- But there is another solution.
- Which?
It won't please you.
No!
Axolotl, open your mouth wide.
There's the T and then comes
the L very quickly.  Axolotl.
- Concentrate.  Ax...
- There's axolotl in...
Listen.
Axolotl.
Axolotl.
Axolotl.
That.  This gentleman did it.
Axolotl.
Have a good day, children.
Have fun.
- And...
- How do you say, children?
- See you later!
- See you later!
Follow me.
- See you later, children.
- See you later.
Is it unpleasant to be
followed when we work?
We are not intimate.
He understands?
We can come to
be, but it takes time.
We must learn to
know each other.
From the start I knew
you were lying, Michel.
It's not your world.
No way.
To my knowledge,
there is only one world.
See?
I thought you understood.
What did I understand?
- That my mother would go to jail?
- No, she doesn't risk anything.
What does she believe?
That a store right in the
center would be free?
Just for my reinsertion?
You said it was a
friend who facilitated this.
There is no friend.
What will it be this time?
Whiskey loading?  Smartphones?
Caviar.
What?
Caviar.
The guy in the beauty
parlor is an Iranian.
He is also a real estate agent.
Abel, come on, please.
I'm coming, director.
I'll be there soon.
I am working.  I do not care.
- I can finish.
- No.
He completes the end of the
month in caviar.  Did you understand?
No.  I do not care.
- The best caviar comes from Iran.
- I know.
In France, there
are those who pay
a fortune to have
a party with caviar.
I can report you.
You won't do it.
AND?  And how do you know?
Your mother loves me
and you love your mother.
Yes, I love her,
so I will protect her.
I can make you disappear today.
He cannot, because
he loves my mother.
Did you see the effect
the store had on her?
We open in a week.
Want to miss it?
Abel, the children are waiting.
Yes, I'm coming, director.
I'll wait at the bar out front.
Sorry.  Good morning children!
- Good morning!
- How are you today?
- All good!
- Did you like the sharks?
If I could do it
differently, I would.
My mother's life is tragic.
Now will the tragedy begin again?
No, it won't start over.
Of course, it will start over.
Damn it.
Let's turn around another way.
I'll take out a loan for the store.
No, it's too late.
I don't want trouble for your mother.
What trouble?
So it is...
An unfulfilled contract
will unnerve everyone.
Cum...
Why did you get into this world?
- It's almost nothing I should do.
- Stop, it's never like that.
Let me tell?  Can I tell?
Thanks.
Hisham, the Iranian
you saw in the hall,
think it's too easy to intercept
a competitor's delivery
and sell it himself.  OK?
What he needs is a guy like me.
Someone pick up the truck
and bring the goods to him.
When will you pick up the truck?
I won't take the whole truck.
Salmon doesn't interest me.
The chauffeur won't even notice.
Are you kidding me?
You will steal it!
Nobody steals from anyone.
There will be no violence.
I do it during my
lunch stop on the road.
He always takes the same route.
Did you understand?
I do while he eats.
He won't notice.
- Will he be alone?
- They always are.
What if he doesn't eat,
if he just drinks coffee?
- How will you do it?
- It's impossible.
- Why impossible?
- I followed him several times.
He arrives every night at
exactly 11:00 pm in the parking lot.
11:03 pm at the latest.
Always in the same place.
The guy is manic.
How so, maniac?
He's a maniac, that's all.
He's a maniac...
has OCD.  It's a "touch".
How do you know that?
He always counts to 3 to
go up a step in the restaurant.
He pulls out the chair 3
times before sitting down.
He always sits at the same table.
Near the window.
So he keeps an eye on the truck.
But he can't see
the back of the truck.
We need to arrive
without being seen.
It's not simple, but
it's not impossible.
For us it's always the
same choreography.
11:10 pm: Mayo eggs and
sparkling water are served.
11:20 pm: A well-done
steak with fries.
11:35 pm: He is served
whipped egg whites with cream.
Yes, a floating island.
A floating island, that.
Then, at 11:45 pm he
leaves with the truck.  Ready
That leaves us about 40 minutes.
At most, more or
less 10 to 15 minutes.
But how are you going to do it?
3 thousand euros a kilo?
How many kilos will they pick up?
200, 300?
- I don't know.
- How much did they offer you?
- Screw that.  - How much?
30 thousand.
Is it a joke?
Did they offer 30 thousand
for this little service?
- Speak lowly.
- Call and say yes!
- On top of that they do it as a family.
- Come.
30,000 euros, damn it!
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- What?
- Of course I know.
- It's a dangerous stretch.
- It could go wrong.
- No, it's a caviar truck!
And?
What do you think the police will say?
"Was it a caviar truck?"
But not.  It's a simple theft.
There is nothing simple.
They always make it look simple.
- They get into trouble.
- They take chances.
Don't risk it, they're
always getting into trouble!
I've known this since I was 12.
When I was 12, there were police
at home because of my mother.
- But it is not the same.
- It's exactly the same.  Exactly.
Don't fucking compare!
There's nothing...
It's on the edge.  People who
take risks because they want to.
They can only get excited
when there's something risky.
I don't want my mother to
end up in jail, or for there
to be inquiries at home,
or for someone to be killed.
If you don't do anything in life, that's
fine, but not being a pain in the ass.
Your mother is happy.  She
found a guy who's damned
so she can be happy and
do what she likes to do.
- Where are you going?
- You're an idiot!  Just that.
Go find your mother, tell her
everything, but forget about me.
- He finished.
- You called me an idiot, did you?
- Yeah, you're an idiot.
- An idiot?
Yes!  You're an idiot!
Hey.
Hey.
How nice, white flowers,
it will be more cheerful.
They are for you.
You are darling.
I didn't have to,
but it's a kindness.
Sorry I was stupid.
I was stupid too.
It's not easy sharing
time with you.
Whenever I see
you, I think of her.
I know, Clemence.
I know.
- Did you tell your mother everything?
- No.
You are right.  It's not
much he asks of me.
If I give you half,
will you do it with me?
Serious?
Yes.  With pleasure.
I got tired of holding
your ends all the time.
It's like with the dog.
- You asked me to adopt you.
- Never, I hate dogs.
- This one is new.
- New how?
It's the perverts who like
dogs.  It's a perversion!
Besides, you're an idiot.
It's an idiot, I don't
know how else to put it.
Don't look at me
like that, it's true.
- Are you kidding me?
- No, you're an idiot.
- Say it one more time.
- You are an idiot.
- Thank you very much!
- I'm sorry about the slap.
I don't know, I was nervous.
Don't be sorry, it was
the best thing you ever did.
This is believed.
The rest was shit.
- Sorry, my bad.
- What was wrong?
What is this dog story?
- It was a couple dispute.
- Does not cause interest.
What is the point of the scene?
- What?
- The purpose of the scene, what is it?
Let him hear us.
- I can't hear, speak louder.
- That the guy keeps listening to us.
- That we put on a show...
- That's right!
We want the guy to be
interested in the discussion.
- So it doesn't attract.
- You are not believable.
- Are we not believable?
- No, they're not.
For the guy to listen
to you instead of
going back to work,
it has to be worth it.
So what do you want?
What interests people today?
What is the biggest
show in the world today?
It's the suffering.
Suffering attracts us all.
We all know the
suffering of love.
- Yes or no?
- Yes...
That!  I need to believe
in your love story.
It was unbelievable there.
I need to believe.
- Sorry, I'm not an actor.
- Abel, don't start.
Abel, you need to feel pleasure.
You must not submit.
You are submitting.
- We should write a text.
- Damn it, Abel!
You fill me up, shit!
I'm giving advice
and you do shit...
Stop Michel!  Stop!
- Calm down.  - Did you see?
It needs to look real like that.
Just like that.
You act too well.
I was in a panic.
Even the dog believed.
Use your affective memory.
That's the important thing.
- Any suggestion?
- I had an idea.
To be evaluated as it is.
An idea...
Why doesn't she seduce the chauffeur?
- No seducing the chauffeur!
- And?
- I seduce the chauffeur?
But not!
- Stop!  Enough?
- No...
- It's up to us to decide.
- I agree!
- I want to seduce the chauffeur.
- Sit down.  You didn't understand.
- We are with you.
- Do.  Want to do?
Let her do it.  Stick a
pair of breasts in him, why.
See how you are?
Can you do the same in the scene?
- We'll just talk.
- Put the same energy.
Don't you want her to seduce the chauffeur?
Use the same energy in the scene.
- I'm listening.
- Staged well.
Go.
Do you remember?
Than?
I don't know.  Whatnot.
- Remember what?
- That he starts!
- Regarding...
- Suffering...
The suffering...
Go on, what do you...
What?
What did I do to you?
I'm tired.
- I said I'd change.
- No, you never change.
Never.
- I don't want you to leave.
- I'm leaving.
Need you.
I will die without you.
Do not touch me.
Screw you if you die!  Die!
- Let's make a baby.
- What?  Now
do you change your
mind?  Now you want a
child why am I leaving?
You drive Me crazy.
- Understand it?
- I love you.  I love you so much.
If it is, I die.
- I'm leaving alone.
- No!
- Yes, I'm leaving, alone.
- I love you so much.
Leave me, you hurt me.
Let me go!
Let go, let go of me!
No...
- Stay with me.
- I don't want to be with you.
I don't want to be with you.
Drop it!  Michel, it hurts.
It hurts!
- Wait...
- Michael...
Now!
Now she decided to intervene.
That's what we're looking for.
Here it is.  It saw?
Yeah, but I can't
be violent with her.
- There is no violence.
- Exist...
I got emotional!
- That, see?
- What a crazy thing.
Take a knife, a plate, break it!
- No!  Do?
- Stop.
Can you do that, asshole?
Take it like this!
Did you deceive me, you whore?
- And?
- He's right.
So what, he won't hit her.
In that, I believe.
Sincerity!  Put it on your head.
Sincerity is everything!
What it was, it's
clumsy, a bit of
violence, and it'll get
the guy's attention.
If he doesn't already
have it in his fucking life.
You piss me off because
it's going to go wrong.
No, don't play.
There you saw it, with
your "I don't want"
and such and such.
She will do what is necessary
and you will encourage her.
Right?  Do you agree?
All right, come on, buddy.
We forget everything, all the
barriers that prevent us from existing.
Something new Changed everything
Something new and I'll go on
We forgot everyone
All the shipwrecks
All boats, rammed, sunk
I do not know how this happened
I don't know why I wasn't
afraid to love anymore
I imagine Songs to dance to
For you
I imagine words In silence
For you
Days and Nights
When Life Begins Again
For you
Once again
Fine my love?
I need to see you.
I miss you so much.
Miss you too.
It's work, I can't do anything.
Yes I know.
What are you doing?
The boss personally
asked me to do an evening.
Come talk to me directly.
We received a large stockpile
of material to unload for them.
They really need me.
But with the store
doing well, he's going to
leave Conforama so that
we can always be together.
Clear.
When you come back tonight,
wake me up tenderly in bed
and he will do to me
what he did yesterday.
I love you so much...
Combined.
I love you Michel.
I love you Sylvie.
Sleep well.
All right, buddy?
- All well and you?
- Peaceful.
Where are we?
They just served the
eggs with mayonnaise.
Right.
Climb.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Yes?
And for eating?
Maybe we'll eat or drink
something, we'll see.
As you wish.
He's not alone, let's go.
- Hang on.
-You're not alone, let's go, he already said.
You have company, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Let's wait.
Calm down.
Soon, he was alone.
Go.
Stop.
Stop.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- How are you?
- All good.
Do you know what you want to eat?
Let's get the sirloin
steak to share.
- Is it enough for two?
- No problem.
- Wine?
- Yes.
Which one would you like?
- It does not matter, the most expensive.
- Right.
- He's the one who pays.
- No problem, thanks.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
GET READY
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of clueless.
Our!
Wait, I got it.
- Thank you very much, bon appetit!
- Thanks.
Sorry, I'm sorry,
but the filet ran out.
To replace I can offer chicken.
I'm not a fan, I've had
this for lunch, forget it.
Or, have fish.
Do not Forget.  I'll go straight
for dessert and a coffee.
- A floating island?
- Yes perfectly.
- And the bill, too.
- No problem, thanks.
- Say something!
- Calm!
- Want to do it?
- Yes.
Help.  Then no, it
can slip and hurt.
- Damn, you piss me off!
- Calm.
Just because I slept with all of
them makes it that way?  Fill my bag?
We are not alone, calm down.
I'm sorry, that's who I am.
My libido is very strong.
What do you want me to say?
Calm down, speak lower.  Lower.
Ten years together and
you don't know what to say?
Something sincere, that comes from the
heart.  I don't inspire anything in you?
Yes you inspire me many things.
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not making fun of you.
Have nothing to say?
Am I anyone for you?
No, you are not just anyone.
Why do you say that?
Because you don't react.
I ask you to react.
What it was?
Say something.
You do me much
more harm than good.
I can't wait forever
- notice me.
- You think I don't notice you?
No, you don't notice me.
- No.
- I only see you, no one else.
Why are you like this?
Because I'm unhappy.
Because I need to protect myself.
Protect yourself from what?
I can't connect with someone.
- I'll get a whiskey.
- A whiskey?
Am sorry.
I'm sorry if we bother you.
No, calm down, I was
listening to my cell phone.
We're not doing
well, my friend and I...
It is complicated.
We fight for nothing.
Could you stay
there a little longer?
Not to go too far?
Why?
He went to get a drink.
Strong alcoholic drink.
If you can just... just watch.
Calm down, there's
still dessert and coffee.
I'll stay here a little while longer.
- If you don't mind.
- No, calm down.
Thanks.
No no.
The floating island.
Shall I bring coffee later?
- Yeah, fine.
- Thanks.
Where is he?
- Yes, that's it.
- The cave of Ali Baba.
We need to get all of that out.
Damn, it's heavy.  Very heavy.
You took your time.
What were you doing?
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.
I'm listening.
Your Tinder guys...
what do you feel
when you see them?
Like this?
I don't know, I've never done that.
I'm curious, do you feel anything?
Yes.
It is clear.
- What do you feel?
- It depends.
I don't know, it
depends on the guy.
Sometimes I feel like I'm
falling in love,
but it doesn't last.
Sometimes I get really excited,
I feel like getting laid, but...
Most of the time it
doesn't work and...
sometimes it is empty,
without the slightest interest.
It takes courage to let so
many people into your life.
I...
I don't let them into my life.
The proof is that you never noticed.
Yeah, but...
what does that do to me,
have you ever wondered?
Don't you think that...
What makes me crazy?
For watching you throw yourself
at guys who use you to get laid?
Do not you think?
I'm not a brave guy!
Besides, it hurts me.
You understand?
AND...
I do not want to lose you.
I really don't want to lose you.
Abel...
Abel, why would you lose me?
You know when you told
me you didn't want to see me
anymore because when you
saw me you thought of Maud?
Yes.
But for me it's the opposite.
It's when I see you that
I don't think about her.
- Go!
- See, it's easy.
Still have 10.
I'm going to the bathroom.
All good?
All.
I'm kind of lost.
I don't know what he
was doing in the bathroom.
Me neither, but...
I'm afraid he's going
to do something stupid.
He has already been injured.
So go.  Don't stand
there, go check it out.
Yes...
Yes.
Could you come with me?
Do not go.
Why would I go with you?
I'm afraid to go alone, I
don't know what to say...
OK let's go.  Come on, let's go.
Go ahead, I'll follow.
You can go ahead of me...
I'm dead, man.  Go.
Jean-Paul, take a look.
Abel?
Where are you?
What?
What are you doing there?
Anything.
Open for me, don't be silly.
- Skirt.  - No?
Why not?  Skirt!
- Abel!  - No, I'm scared.
Fear of what?
I shouldn't have said all that.
Why?
Because after...
you won't be here anymore.
You won't be here anymore.
It's been so long.
Damn it!
Abel, it's been so long.
I love you.
I love you so much that...
Sometimes I feel like my
heart is going to explode.
I'm in love with you, Abel.
I'm in love with you.
Can you open here?
I'm going to take
a walk outside.
- All good.  Are you safe now?
- Yes it is...
- Here it is.
- Thanks.
Is cold.
The nanny called me, let's go.
- What?
- Fast please.
- Fast.
- Yes.
- Wait, wait.
- What it was?
What are you doing?
Let's eat one, shall we?
- Serious?
- Yes.
Friend, we never eat.
- Look how beautiful it is.
- AND.
- Take a box.
- No.
- Grab one and let's go.
- It's OK.
Damn, you drive me crazy.
There are cops everywhere.
Lower your head, let's go straight.
- Lower your head.
- Already downloaded.
It's fucking hell.  It's hell.
Wait, wait.  What is there?
- Lower your head.
- I am downloading.
You discreetly back out,
- Let's go out the back.
- OK.
Cum.  Wait, they're passing.
They are passing by, don't move.
Fuck, it's a nightmare.
Do not move!
- Calm!
- Do not move!
Get out, fuck.
- Do not move.  Give the key!
- Calm.
- Quick, the key!
- What key?
- The one in the van!
- They're not cops.
Yes they are.  Damn look!
- Calm.
- The keys.
I'll give.  Who do I give it to?
- For me!
- You, shut up!
Key to what?  Shut up!
Jean-Paul, what is this?
Shut up, you!
Lower your weapon!
Michel, lower your weapon, I'll
explain.  Download your weapon!
- They're not cops.
- What are you going to do?  No!
No!  No!  No!
Fuck.
She is completely crazy.
Cum!
Think of your family, trust me I
will explain.  Lower your weapon.
- You don't have the slightest chance, go.
- Lower.
- You don't stand a chance.
- Lower your weapon.
- Lower your weapon!
- Throw it on the floor.
Michael!
- Do not move.
- Motherfucker.
Where is the key?
- Don't go ahead, buddy.
- Are you going to shoot me?
Police, you are surrounded!
- What is she making up?
- Put down your weapons, I told you!
Go see what this is.
- Did you flip it?
- Don't move, Michael.
We have snipers!
We hit you whenever you want.
- What the fuck is she doing?
- If one moves,
I'm going to blow your head off, okay?
Lying on the floor,
bunch of motherfuckers!
Cum...
On the ground, I told you.
Download your weapon!
Cum!
Clemence!
Michael!  Michel, go up, go up!
I got hit.
Where?  Where?
On the leg.
She's bleeding!
Hello?  I'm a truck driver,
they're stealing my truck.
Relais de La Salle car park.
- Where is Clemence?
- I don't know.
Where the fuck is Clémence?
You are wrong?
Yes.
Download, they will kill you.
Wait, that's her over there.
- Go!
- Damn road!
- Follow them!  - What the hell!
What happened?
- Jean-Paul... He tried to rob us.
- He's your best man.
He is a traitor.
He's stuck in the back.
Accelerate, accelerate!
Accelerate, I said!
It will kill us!  Cum!
It's overtaking me!
Do you want to kill us?
- You want to kill us?
- Stop!
- Fuck...
- Fuck!
Stop, stop!
Michael, stop, stop!
Let's stop!
It's going to kill someone.
Stop, go!
I'll call the police.
Clémence stop the van and arrive!
Nothing arrives.  Call Clemence.
- Clémence?
- What?
- We're behind you.
- I know, I see.
Michel was shot.
I got shot in the leg, I
need to go to the hospital.
Clemence, listen.
At the next corner, you stop.
Get down as low as possible
and I'll replace
you, understand?
No, I'll take care of Jean-Paul.
- Do as I say!
- Clémence, listen to what Michel says!
He leaves me.  Let me
do it, I know what I'm doing!
You go to the hospital,
I'll take care of Jean-Paul
and put the goods
to refrigerate.
No, no, Clemence!  Clemence!
Why put it in the fridge?
What is she talking about?
Caviar will rot if not cooled.
- Damn, you're bleeding.
- Is nothing.
No, I'm terrified.
It's bleeding too much!
Stop, my dear.
Come on, you're falling behind!
Where are you going?
Let's go to the hospital
and that's it!  To the hospital.
Cum...
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
There's a guy following
me for like 10 minutes.
I don't know what you're
doing, but it scares me.
If you can at least take a look.
- That car?
- AND.
- We will see.
- Stand aside.
It's scandalous that in 2022
there are still guys who do...
Somebody!  Somebody, come, come!
Come.
Quick, move the fuck!
- He's pissing blood!
- Stop yelling.
- What happened?
- Damn it, he pisses blood.
- Calm down.
- He needs a doctor.
- Can you walk?
- We'll take care of your father.
- No, no...
- We'll take care of it.  Calm down.
- I'm calming down.
- Does it hurt to walk?
- Accident at work.
- We'll take care of it.
He's been pissing
blood for 1 hour.
- Sir...
- I'll wait in reception.
- My son gets nervous quickly.
-He gives Hisham's number.
Find Clémence, I'll
take care of the rest.
No, he gives me Hisham's number.
He gives Hisham's number.
Cum.
Clemence, where are you?
I left the hospital, please call.
Call me, please, Clémence.
I'm worried, please call me.
Yes, the mobile fell.
I went back
and stuck a
screwdriver in the leg.
I'm at the hospital, I came
straight, it was the simplest.
No, you don't, Sylvie.
Tomorrow, or later, I'll
leave, it was silly, it's nothing.
I'll be right there.
Clemence, where are you?
I left the hospital, please call.
Call me, please, Clémence.
I'm worried, please call me.
Clemence, where are you?
I left the hospital, please call.
Call me, please, Clémence.
I'm worried, please call me.
Clemence, where are you?
What would you do if
something happened to me?
I'll answer when you tell me
where it is.  Where are you?
On the aquarium.
I'll be there soon.
- Hello.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
The injury is perfect.
It will heal completely.
- And no shrapnel, that's the main thing.
- Shrapnel of what?
Of metal...
It's because in the atelier...
One day it would happen.
Last time it was a...
I cut my hand on account
of a glass that exploded.
- Then there was a staircase...
- You better be quiet.
Come sit here.
I don't want to
bother the nurse.
No, I'm done.
I'll leave them,
come back later.
Come close to me.
I won't go if you
keep telling lies.
What happened to you?
I already told you.
Now, tell me the truth.
I fucked up.
Couldn't have done otherwise.
Regarding what?
Regarding the store.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
I didn't mean to worry you.
Now I don't know
who I married anymore.
Like this?
It was with me, honey.
- Come here.
- Not me...
The one I married
promised not to lie to me.
Remember that?
Why this wound?
That wasn't a screwdriver.
They shot me.
Did you steal again then?
Sorry.  Can I tell your
son to go upstairs or not?
No.  OK.
Until later.
You have a son, do you?
Who is your child?
Abel.
Abel is my son.
What were they
doing together tonight?
He's fine, calm down.
He's with Clémence.
What did you do
together tonight?
Sylvie...
Sylvie!
You did something you
never, ever should have done.
You involved Abel.
And now, demolished everything.
Goodbye.
All good?
All.
- You worried me, you see?
- I know.
But see, it's okay.
It worked fine there.
Very good.
- True?
- Clear.
- At first, I was a pain in the ass.
- Yeah, but it progressed.
At some point, I don't
know what happened...
I don't know either, but...
Hello, Hisham?
I'm calling from Michel.
It's about delivery.
Good.
Go, get out of the way.
- Will you take care of yourself?
- I go.
- Promise?
- Yes.
See you soon.
See you soon.
Shit, fuck.
I spread it everywhere.
Shit!
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Hisham sent me here.
Michel sent me here.
Police, don't move!
Stay where you are!
- Hands to something!
- Don't move!
I'm stopped, I'm stopped.
- Show your hands.
- I'm stopped.
- For the ground.  For the ground!
- OK.
I'm stopped.
Okay, I have nothing, nothing.
- I have nothing with me.
- Name?
- Abel.
- Surname?
- Lefranc.
- Age.
- 32 years old.
- Profession?
Poet.
Can we talk seriously
for 5 minutes?
The staff will be
direct with you.
It sucks for us to
be here at this hour.
We know very well that
you didn't set up the scam.
We know and you know too.
You have the
caviar, the Iranian,
me, what else do you want?
May you tell the truth.
PENITENTIARY
"Abel,
I hope your days aren't too long
and the nights
are not too noisy.
It's the most boring thing about jail.
Noise at night.
The rest, we got
used to everything.
What is good with human being
and that we get
used to everything.
Thank you for the letter
you sent to your mother,
made me emotional."
Our rifles are loaded!
Let's count to 5, put
down your weapons!
- One.
- Stop!
- Three...
- Stop!
No!
"At the moment, she refuses
to answer me,
but I don't despair.
I know she's calm and that's
the most important thing.
When you and I first met,
I told you you'd get better.
I think that's the case today.
I'm very happy for you.
I think of you two.
In both of you with tenderness.
Michael."

Excuse me, will it be...
could I make a little speech?
- Please.
- Thanks.
Abel...
I would like to say
that I am proud of you.
In the eyes of some, you screwed
up, but I know
you were generous.
That's life.
I created you alone.
I had you young.
You too, created me.
We didn't do so badly.
I don't love anyone
as much as I love you.
Live well, Clémence.
Live well, you.
Can we move forward?
Yes.
MS.  Clémence Genièvre, accepts
Mr.  Abel Lefranc present here?
