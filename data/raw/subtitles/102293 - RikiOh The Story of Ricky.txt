Screenplay by Nam Nai-choi
Here we are.
You, step out,
report your name and make it loud.
My name's Yip Ming.
Yip Ming, 37 years old,
sentenced to serve seven years
for robbery and assault.
Go on!
Go over there!
Next! Hurry up.
My name is Lee Shan.
Lee Shan, 28 years old,
sentenced to serve five years
for stealing from his company.
Go on.
Stand over there!
Next!
Ricky Ho.
Come forward.
Ricky Ho, 21 years old,
sentenced to serve ten years
for manslaughter and assault.
Hey! I didn't say you could go.
He's carrying a weapon!
Release him.
Why didn't you let the doctors
take the bullets out?
- They're souvenirs.
- Take those three away first.
The warden is the most
powerful person here.
After him it's the assistant warden.
The prison is divided into four
wings - north, south, east and west.
They're controlled
by the Gang of Four.
You've only just arrived,
so none of you can meet
the warden or assistant warden yet.
But you must know the rules here.
Goddammit! Why do I have
to get up so early?
Captain, that's my towel.
- Do you want to fight?!
- Samuel's bullying people again.
He's the captain of the cell block.
- He's friends with the guards, too.
- What can you do?
On your knees and apologise!
This little train is very cute!
I made that out of wood.
It's for my kid.
It's for your kid.
That's right. I hear
your probation's coming through.
Really?
Without my approval,
there's no probation.
You better watch yourself
if you know what's good for you.
Samuel, you bastard!
What's going on?
Sir, the clumsy old fool
fell down on the floor.
He just fell over
right on top of that plane.
He's groaning like a pig.
What a nuisance!
Stop screaming and watch your step.
What's your hurry, old fool?
Captain, are we leaving?
- We haven't brushed our teeth yet.
- Who cares?
Captain!
What do we do now?
Bastard, you're asking for it!
Are you talking to me?
Breakfast. Here's breakfast.
Captain, drink some milk.
How am I supposed to drink it?
There's no straw. Stupid fool!
Goddammit! Bastard!
How dare he pick on me!
I'll let him know why I'm called
the North-Wing Killer!
Captain, why don't we get Mad Dragon
to take care of him?
- Mad Dragon?!
- That's a good idea.
Mad Dragon ate the warden's horse
the other day.
He's still in isolation.
When will Mad Dragon be let out?
What about tomorrow?
You can have my allowance
for this month as a reward.
All right! I happen to be broke.
Watch out, Mad Dragon makes trouble
every time he's out.
If he's real bad,
I won't take the blame.
Don't worry.
Me?
What's that?
They rejected my probation?!
The captain told me...
Did you send a letter home secretly?
No, I didn't. I didn't do that.
- I didn't, sir.
- You didn't, my ass!
You're lying!
Sir, believe me, I'm not lying.
I want to go home
to see my wife and kids.
I haven't stopped dreaming about them
since my first day here.
- That's enough.
- Please stop!
You're unlucky.
Sir, wait!
Please! Wait, sir!
Old man Ma hanged himself!
One of Samuel's men grassed him up.
So the warden rejected his probation.
- He's really unlucky.
- He was a model citizen.
When he was rushing his pregnant wife
to hospital, he ran someone over.
It should have been a traffic
offence, but the guy was a cop,
so they gave him a long sentence
and sent him here.
Ricky, why are you here?
He's dead already.
Take his handcuffs off!
Ricky, take it easy.
Time's up. Come on, come on.
Hurry up!
All right, next batch!
You have 15 minutes
to do your laundry or take a shit.
Ricky.
Someone gave me 30 pounds of rice
to turn you into mincemeat.
Do you think you can do it?
Go on, get him.
Of course you'll beat him.
Stop fighting!
He killed both of them!
Another move and I'll hit you.
Follow me.
- Can't you take a shower in peace?
- Sir!
I want to talk to that kid,
all right?
You're not bad.
- I don't think we've met.
- Me neither.
I'm head of the North Wing
Gang of Four.
As your leader, after
the assistant warden's punished you,
I'll see you are disciplined here.
We'll take you to see
the assistant warden tomorrow.
''Here Lies Ho Do-wong''
You are Mr Ho's son, Ricky.
You are...?
I'm Uncle Ghost.
Even when you were a child,
you had superhuman strength.
I've been keeping an eye
on you since then.
You're no longer a child, do you
still have your super strength?
I'm much stronger now.
Why don't you show me
just how strong?
All right.
Uncle Ghost, watch out!
- That hurt!
- You're still as clumsy as always.
You know chi gung!
Uncle, I want to learn chi gung
so I can help poor people.
Chi gung requires strong
emotional control.
Remember, chi gung
accumulates energy in the body
and turns the body into
a natural shield against all attack.
When you have energy,
you should be able to use it.
Call forth your energy and break this
headstone with your arms and legs.
Watch this first.
Now I want you to practise
using your strength.
Ricky, take advantage
of your strength.
Now you'll become stronger
when your enemy is stronger than you.
Give it a try.
Good.
The assistant warden wants you.
The prisoner's here.
Bring him in.
Hold it.
Read me his report.
Ricky Ho, aged 21 ,
blood type AB, parents unknown,
brought up in an orphanage.
He didn't do well
in either primary or high school.
He joined a music school
to learn the flute
and then disappeared for two years.
During those two years he was seen
fighting on the streets.
He murdered a man
and was sentenced for the crime.
The report also says
he is extremely dangerous.
That's it.
Where were you for those two years?
What did you do?
Come on. Tell me!
Why do you have bullets
in your chest?
You still have a while to go,
you'll tell me eventually.
We got a letter for you this morning.
There's a photograph inside.
Come here and take a look.
Don't you ever play me for a dummy.
I'll show you what I'm made of.
I want to see how tough
the man who killed Mad Dragon
and Samuel really is.
You're used to this.
Are you a trained killer?
Tell me!
Ricky, don't tell me
you're a special agent.
But if that is the case,
I can help you out.
I arranged an accidental death once
for a prisoner
suspected of espionage.
You asshole! You messed it all up.
I tried to be nice.
I can kill you right now!
Or I'll have fun
with your girlfriend.
She's very pretty. Let me bring her
back here, and then I'll...
You want me to fight back,
don't you?!
Look, don't be stupid.
The warden isn't around,
so I'm in charge here.
If you touch me, you're a dead man.
Ricky!
How dare you! I won't forget this.
Keep your nose out of my affairs.
He can hurt people
without even touching them.
What kind of a demon is he?
- Let me try!
- OK, come on.
Let me do it myself.
Ying, look.
''Ying is Like a Firefly
Lighting Up the Night''
Come on.
What time do you think it is?!
Stop that noise!
'He's a real playboy,
he's got lots of lovers
'But he doesn't know
if he needs to go to the toilet'
- Hold it! What's this about?
- Stop acting dumb.
- How many guys have you grassed on?
- No way, I'm no grass.
You had old Ma killed,
you son-of-a-bitch!
I swear to God, I didn't do anything!
Kuang, the asshole's lying.
Listen, I know you're pissed off.
I'll do anything.
- Right, you asshole, listen up.
- First, eat shit.
And then lick our shoes clean.
And... Kuang, what do you want?
And then I cut you into little pieces
and feed you to the dogs!
Kuang, are you serious?
No! I beg you, please!
Kuang!
Hai.
- Please help me.
- Piss off!
Kuang, don't go too far.
If you kill him,
what do we say to Cyclops?
Hai, lots of men have died because
of him, we won't take it any more.
Don't tell me you've forgotten
who does the punishing here.
You should know that.
Kuang, I want you to tell everyone
the rules of the North Wing
just one more time.
In the North Wing, only you,
Hai, can punish people.
Let Ba Chu go and forget about
the old man, all right?
Hai.
Why let him walk away
like the others?
You don't punish them either.
What's the point of rules?
If you're not fair,
how can we respect you?
You disrespect me,
that's against the rules.
Hai, well done!
I'll take care of him now.
You asked for it, bastard!
What about Kuang?
I'll use him as bait
to get Ricky.
I don't follow you.
You must teach the prisoners
in your wing a lesson!
If they all act like Ricky,
I'll be damned!
Hai!
I'll let you use the knife
to enforce the rules.
Do you want some mints?
Hai!
I want a good show, all right?
You're pretty good, it's too bad
you don't follow the rules.
You may be tough, but I must protect
the Gang of Four's reputation,
so I'm going to finish you off today!
- Why don't you fight back?
- I want you to be fair.
Let Kuang go. Then I'll fight.
I make the rules, you got that?
When Hai shows his tattoo,
he has to kill! You must fight.
Ricky! If you don't,
Kuang will die for sure. Go on!
- Go on, Ricky!
- You can do it!
- Go on!
- Go on!
That's a present from Cyclops.
Let's see if you're as strong
when you're blind!
Well, blind man, your arm's gone now.
Ricky, you're finished.
- Ricky! How are you?
- Are you all right?
There's a fight in the North Wing.
I hear Hai's fighting Ricky.
- Has anyone been killed yet?
- Let's go!
- Well done!
- Come on!
So you can still see,
but your right arm's crippled.
You've had it.
What's he doing?
He just fixed his right arm!
Ricky, you're the best.
Hai, don't be stupid.
We'll die together.
Hai, you really live up
to your reputation.
Do I have to kill you, Hai?
- Well done!
- He's dead.
- Ricky, well done!
- Ricky, well done!
That's unbelievable!
- Kuang! Kuang!
- He's dead!
- He's dead.
- Look at him.
- Kuang.
- Kuang!
They taste awful today!
Cyclops! You're behind all this!
Let's kill the bastard!
Avenge Kuang's death!
Get him!
- Get him!
- What are you doing?
Stop that!
Have you forgotten the Gang of Four?
We have Ricky on our side.
We fear no one, not even you.
We want to kill you!
Ricky, I'd like you to meet
some people.
This is the head of the West Wing,
Wong Chun...
head of the East Wing, Tarzan,
and from the South Wing, White God.
If you're really tough,
let's see you take on these three.
Come on, Ricky.
We can help you. Get him!
Ricky, come on!
- Where are you going?
- Ricky!
- Ricky!
- Ricky.
Ricky, let's kill those swines!
Let's avenge Kuang's death
and finish those suckers.
Go back to your wings. Kuang and Hai
are both dead. Isn't that enough?
Ricky, do you want to join
the Gang of Four?
- It's Sa. He's Hai's godson.
- Hai's dead. He must feel terrible.
Not like that. Blow a little lighter
and roll your tongue back.
Hai's dead, you must be very sad.
Someone cut off your tongue?!
Hey! Try playing this.
It has a better sound.
Where did you get these poppy leaves?
That's the West Wing.
What's the matter?
Sa told Ricky about the poppies.
What? But Sa is a mute.
You think I'm lying? Sa's with Ricky,
he's working against us now.
- Don't you know that?
- That's enough.
Do you have evidence?
If he's really betrayed us,
nobody will be able to save him.
- Sa!
- Take it easy.
Sa, this knife belonged to Hai.
The rules state
that kin must avenge the deceased.
Take this and get rid of Ricky.
Look what Ricky did to Hai. Don't you
think you should avenge his death?
Traitor!
This time we won't
just cut off your tongue.
Isn't that Sa?
What happened to him?
- Is that him?
- Yes.
His skin's been peeled off.
It must have been Wong Chun.
Sa's really unlucky.
When he saw something
he shouldn't have,
Wong Chun cut off his tongue.
- Now look what's happened to him.
- What did Sa see?
Forget it, Ricky, you don't want to
mess with Wong Chun, do you?
But Sa knew what would happen.
After Hai's death, it was only
a matter of time before they got him.
Bastard!
What?! Ricky knows about the poppies?
Wong Chun, don't you know how
to do your job?!
West Wing's on fire!
Goddammit! How could this be?!
Who lit the fire?
Shit! They're burning everything.
Bastard! Why are you growing opium?
So it was you who started the fire.
I'm going to kill you
to avenge Sa's death.
- The West Wing is on fire.
- What's burning?
What's that strange smell?
That bastard Wong Chun
is growing opium in his cell.
Squeeze the juice from the poppy,
dry it and you get opium...
which claims so many innocent lives!
Damn you! You destroyed my hard work.
I'll kill you for that.
His kung fu is unorthodox.
I've hit your death spot,
you'll soon be a dead man.
Let's burn down the prison,
then we can escape.
I want you to go
and lock them up in their cells.
Yes, sir.
You... Just go!
Sir, the fire department called
to see what's happening.
Just tell them
that we're busy burning rubbish.
Is the police department
on the phone now?
It's the warden,
he's back from Hawaii tomorrow.
What?! He's coming back?
Damn! Why is he coming back so soon?
Sound the Zero Alarm!
I can't, sir. Ricky and Wong Chun
are still outside.
Just follow my orders.
A man looks his best just before
dying, especially a man like you.
You pissed a lot of people off
by burning my work.
The warden for one
will never forgive you.
Ricky, try harder now.
You can defeat them.
No wonder everyone's
been saying you're a demon,
you can even overcome
my deadly strike.
But even if you're safe right now,
you'll never make it
through the night.
Wong Chun, catch!
All right, we'll cremate you.
Ricky can't die yet.
I still haven't fought the bastard.
Tarzan, are you out of your mind?
'Zero Alarm warning, anyone
not in their cells in one minute
'will be shot on sight.'
Tarzan, we must kill Ricky now
and go back to the cells.
Damn it, get out of my way
or I'll kill you as well.
Bastard, you're really
pissing me off today.
Ricky, let's have a duel right here.
You're real lucky.
I still have to show everyone
the opium.
Once the cement dries off,
he won't be able to move.
There goes the evidence.
Clean the cement off Tarzan.
As for Ricky Ho, after I deal with
the warden, I'll take care of him.
Hey, I'm right here. No problem, OK.
The warden's back, open the gate!
Open the gate!
Get the gate, the warden's here!
The warden's here.
Get up! Get up!
Stand up straight.
Warden, welcome back.
Well, how was Hawaii?
Oh, my God!
Are you hurt? Are you all right?
Don't cry. It's OK.
Who rolled out the carpet?
Not me. Not me.
- Sir, this man rolled it out.
- You?!
It's not my fault.
Let me go, please!
Hey, why didn't you check the carpet
before we arrived?
Where are your eyes?
If you don't open your eyes,
what use are they?
Come on.
Anything happen while I was away?
Some prisoners rebelled
and some prisoners died.
They're dying every month.
What's wrong with you?
Since the prison was privatised,
the prisoners have become the
cheapest and the best labour force.
You take good care of them now. Don't
let them die from hunger or illness.
- He's eating a candle.
- Keep an eye on the prisoners!
It's only candy.
Is there anything else?
Yes, sir. The opium stock...
a fire burnt it all.
What? What happened? What happened?
- Get my pills! Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.
Here, sir.
Warden, that's him.
It's OK. Don't be scared.
I've waited for you all night.
- Kill him! Kill him, quick!
- Ricky, do you want to die?
Is the opium stock yours?!
Ricky, I want to fight you.
Warden, have a seat.
Tarzan is considered the best fighter
in the Gang of Four.
Ricky's finished for sure now.
He doesn't have my permission
to die yet.
Warden, whatever you want.
How dare you scare the warden?
Good work!
One, two, three, four...
five...six!
Well, how do you like that?
- You hit like a girl.
- So you want some more, do you?!
Warden, Tarzan used
to open coconuts this way.
Ricky's head will explode any minute.
Get up! You're really useless.
How could you just die like that?
Shut up!
We're human beings, human beings!
Looks like you're a real tough guy.
No wonder you got into
so much trouble here.
Bastard! You're growing opium
and killing innocent men!
Ricky, what are you trying to find
out here? What do you want?
He won't talk just yet.
But when the panel comes down...
Not bad. Not bad.
Ricky, you're putting up a pretty
good show, I'll join in for the fun.
This is the latest stun gun
with 100,000 volts.
Soon you'll be a meat patty.
You're still alive?!
Warden, can't you see
that I'm still in here?
- You're no good to me now.
- I've been nothing but loyal to you.
So what? You're no use to us now.
Give it up.
Tarzan, come on out!
Ricky, I can't make it.
Mum, I'll be
the first to go after all!
They all have relatives
awaiting their release.
You use them
then discard them like dirty rags!
You asked for it.
There's no way you can escape.
- Cyclops.
- Yes, sir.
Tomorrow, summon all the prisoners
to the compound.
Warden, please.
Ricky Ho has caused lots of trouble
here. He'll be punished severely.
I want everybody
to shovel some dirt into the pit.
He wants us to bury Ricky alive.
If we get involved, we'll be doing
their dirty work. That's not right.
- Tell them to start.
- Yes, sir.
Big Boy, Brain Cell, you two first.
The rest of you better follow.
Go on.
Ricky, what shall we do?
Follow orders,
you're no match for him.
But then you'll be dead!
Shut up!
Save your words for when
you visit his grave. Here!
Ricky, I have no choice.
- Ricky, l'm sorry.
- Next!
Ricky, l'm sorry.
Go on!
Ricky, real sorry about this.
Listen up, men.
If Ricky Ho survives the next seven
days, I'll consider him a free man!
Great!
Good luck. Good luck.
Good luck.
This is the oxygen tube.
Let's see if you can make it, huh?
Get your ass over here!
Let's get on with it.
I wonder if Ricky will make it.
I sure hope he does.
If he dies, it's because of us.
- It's Ricky!
- Ricky?
He's still alive!
It's him.
- He really is alive.
- He can survive that, yeah!
Wong Chun, that was a great shot.
Looks like he'll need a plumber.
Boss, this chick saw us dealing.
I brought her back for you.
What do we do with her?
I told you to be careful!
If an old lady sees you,
am I to deal with her, too?
Right, boss. Excuse us.
Hold it right there!
Goddammit,
what the hell's your problem?
- Move!
- Move it!
Do you hear me? Move it!
Move, stand aside.
- Go on.
- Move!
It's been raining for seven days.
The ground's wet and cold.
If he's still alive,
he must be superman.
- Ricky!
- Ricky!
- Ricky!
- He's dead.
Poor guy!
- Ricky.
- He's moving. He's not dead.
He's only sleeping.
What the hell? He's still alive.
Release him! Release him!
- Good work! What a hero!
- It's a miracle!
- Take him away. Quick!
- Yes, sir.
Here!
I don't think I've ever
seen anyone as tough as yourself.
I think we can be friends.
A wolf and a pig
can never be friends.
You're growing opium here.
You're all killers!
I'll settle this...
- Shut up!
- You lousy bastard!
I see you'd rather be my enemy.
Apart from the opium,
what else do you want?
- Go on, hit him.
- Right.
The report says you disappeared
for two years. Where did you go?
As long as you're still alive,
I can make you talk.
Let me do it.
You lit the fire to lure me into
the open. What did you have in mind?
Even if you want to die,
you must still answer my questions.
Warden, are you all right?
The day I reveal my secrets
will be the day you die!
Cyclops!
Sir?
Bring me my pills!
Ricky, Ricky.
Ricky.
I brought some food for you.
You haven't eaten for a week.
Don't forget you're our only hope.
Ricky, come on, eat.
The warden's a tough guy.
Ricky, you must be careful.
''Don't Give Up''
See you tomorrow.
What the hell's he doing here?
That's Fa.
Bu Chu must have grassed him up.
Ricky, I got a present for you.
I'll tear both of you
into pieces right here!
Now it's your turn.
Ricky, hold it!
Emergency! Send in a SWAT team
immediately. Over!
'They're on the way. Over.'
Fa! Ricky, Fa's not going to make it!
Fa!
Ricky...are...you...OK?
Thanks for the food.
Fa!
Cyclops!
You're responsible for
Fa's death! Stop running!
Cyclops!
Bastard, you killed Fa!
You're a murderer!
You're a dead man!
Good work!
Bastard!
Don't you want to live, or what?!
You hit me! Son-of-a-bitch!
- Let's help him.
- Get them!
Take me to see the warden.
Sir, the prisoner's menu
for tomorrow is ready.
Please have a look.
They'll have some beans,
vegetables and meat for lunch.
Don't you think that's too much?
Here, we'll halve the vegetables
and the beans.
We'll save the meat for dinner.
Behave. Good boy.
- Make sure no one starves to death.
- Yes, sir.
You eat like a lousy king.
Even your dog gets a big steak.
Not enough to eat? Right,
I'll give you some more then.
That enough?
We're not animals!
So you think you're human beings?
To me you're lower than a fly.
Ricky!
What happened?
Warden, there's a riot.
Central control has been disrupted.
All the alarms are out.
You assholes, I'll kill you all.
Warden... No!
You couldn't control the situation,
so there's the riot.
You're better off dead.
Warden, no!
These guns are made
for shooting elephants.
Ricky, it's your turn.
While you still live,
- they'll never go to their cells.
- Bastard, you can't kill Ricky.
Who wants to die first?
Are you turning against us?
- Warden, I'll go get more men.
- Go on.
Bastard, we'll kill you!
Go on, get out of here.
Come on. Push that button, it's fun.
Hey...
Get rid of Ricky!
Wong Chun! No more fooling around.
Kill the bastard.
Now you'll never
be able to kill again!
No!
Don't kill me, don't kill me!
I almost forgot,
you're not afraid of bullets.
Come here.
Take my son away. If any prisoners
try to get in your way, kill them.
Yes, sir.
- Ricky, may the best man win.
- You think you're real tough.
I'm a lot tougher than you think.
The warden is usually the best
kung fu fighter in a private prison.
Now see for yourself.
Ricky, come and show me
what you've got.
Your strength doesn't even
come close to mine.
We've got the same kung fu style.
Didn't you know?
'If your opponent is strong,
use your wits to beat him.'
- Back to your cells, assholes!
- You bastards! Let's get them!
Bastards!
Stop fighting!
You're all free now!
