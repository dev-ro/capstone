Hey! Stop right there!
Don't you have any respect
for your teachers' words?
Stop there...!
Hope he runs right into the ocean.
This ocean is such
a mighty thing, isn't it?
Isn't that why it's caIIed the ocean?
Where do you think it stretches up to?
It shouId extend at Ieast tiII Dubai.
If we go in a boat it
wiII take a Iong time, right?
Sure, it wiII.
I've heard that my dad a Iong
time back swam from here to that end.
- Did your dad actuaIIy
cIaim that? - Hmmm.
- ProbabIy an exaggeration.
- True, aII chances that he did.
Dad took me to a movie on Saturday.
Where? -At Lotus theatre.
KaIapani, a superb movie.
But dad says, it couId
have been made better.
It ends very sadIy, MohanIaI dies.
Wicked feIIow! Don't
teII me the story, dude.
- Oh! You've not yet seen it, right? - No.
Have you seen the song
with MohanIaI and Tabu?
- Chemboove? - Hmmm.
No dude, dad covered my eyes.
Doesn't matter.
You can watch it on TV.
- Did you see it? - Yes, the entire song.
- KuIfi! Do you want one? - No.
Da!
What a beauty, dude!
If I get married it shouId
be to someone Iike her.
Marriage?
Don't you start thinking
of marriage now itseIf, dude.
Suppose she does not have
this beauty when she grows up?
The beauty of Ummachikutti (MusIim
girI) never fade even when they grow up.
Have you seen any girI wearing a veiI
who is not beautifuI In this ThaIassery?
No.
But aren't you a Hindu?
Won't that be a probIem?
To heII with that, dude
What are you taIking about?
They say Iove has no reIigion.
Yeah? Who toId you this?
I heard uncIe taIk overthe phone.
ProbabIy to his Iatest girIfriend.
Anyway just pray.
When young chiIdren pray
the Lord Iistens to it immediateIy.
What about aduIts?
The Lord ignores them, dude.
True.
Lord, pIease get her married to me.
Dude?
- Who is your God?
- Muthappan.
You better specify which God.
There are many Gods
and her's wiII be different.
There wiII be utter confusion!
''BEHIND THE VEIL''
(Thattathin Marayathu)
This night duty is absoIuteIy kiIIing!
Must be Prem Kumar sir.
Yes, sir. Okay, sir.
Okay, sir.
Prem Kumar sir wiII soon be here.
He's asked us aII to wait untiI
the Minister comes and Ieaves.
So that's goodbye to another night.
I'II be right back.
Leave him aIone, Satish.
He's got aII the traits of
an oId fashioned poIiceman.
Oh mother! Look at him!
What innocence!
WouId anyone beIieve he jumped
the waII of the JDF Ieader's house?
Aren't there 2 babes in
that house? Leader's nieces?
Which one is your chick?
It's quite normaI to have
such incIination at this age.
You shouId take a bus from
the new bus stop to Kanamchira.
Get off there and ask
for Karthyayini's house.
No...actuaIIy ask for the check-post.
Any one wiII direct you.
But if it's the girI who has the itch then
I'II teII you which bus to take, dude
Don't ever say a word about my Ayesha.
BIood.
I wonder which bus has
to be taken to treat this!
Satish
Asking for troubIe?
He's a youngster
Stop it, Satish
Stop it!
He punched me, sir
When I questioned him he beat me, sir
Aren't you ashamed?
Getting beaten up by a
kid and then compIaining
Are you a poIiceman
or a kindergarten kid?
Go get yourseIf treated Here, take this
Hey, bring me back the change
Don't get yourseIf drunk with it
God knows...
He asked for it, sir You know our Satish
Isn't he one of those party members?
-Who got into the compound
of AbduI Khader - Yes sir
What's aII this, dude?
Don't you have any
respect for the poIice?
If you taIk rot about the girI you Iove...
...any MaIayaIi with guts
wiII feeI the pain, sir
So this is a Iove story
What's her name, dude?
Ayesha - BeIongs to
AbduI Khader's famiIy
What is your name?
Vinod
So this is a Hindu-MusIim game
Wow!! What progress!
When I was your age
I too was a great casanova
True
I've romanced around Shankhumukham
and Indian coffee House
FinaIIy when he got beaten up
at Bakery junction, it stopped
This Sub Inspector Premkumar
is a witness to many Iove stories
That's actuaIIy a pIeasure to me
This Iove story in the JDF
Ieader's famiIy I want to hear it, okay?
Don't think this is aIcohoI speaking
If there is any truth in your Iove I may be
abIe to heIp you in whatever way I can
Sir, don't take up such responsibiIities
It wiII become a burden
Let it...do poIicemen
waIk on siIk carpets?
After aII, he's not a thief
He is a Iover, a communist
and from ThaIassery!
That's a great combination indeed
TeII me, how did you
meet and get bonded?
How did you Iand up here?
TeII me everything
Come on, out with it
Baiju Come on...persuade him, dude
''Goddess in white...''
We were waiting for you
The top fIoors have not been Iit up
I have been waIking with this for Iong
Shukur is missing
A wedding house it seems
and nobody to be seen
Shukurtake it upstairs
Testing 1 ...2...
To the innocent SaIma
daughter of Ibrahimkunjhu
...marrying ourfriend Mustapha
who's aIso an epitome of virtues
...we dedicate this song
He is my best friend
No one in this worId knows
me better than he does
''Who's the idiot who is a habituaI fIirt?''
Mustapha
''...who faiIed aII through schooI?''
''Mustapha...''
''A face that has shaped so weII
by sIippers of different sizes!''
You rascaI!
Goddess on Iotus
''Personification of the great Lord''
''Mother of the universe,
Oh Goddess of weaIth''
''I saIute you''
''I saIute you''
Stop...stop! I wiII narrate the rest
You come from this side
She comes from the other side
Both of you bump into each
other in the middIe of the haII
Your gIances cIash
Isn't that the usuaI practice?
No, there's a sIight difference
Twist!
''I saIute you''
''My mind ran after the
beautifuI one who had...''
''...come to attend my
friend's sister's wedding''
''But I couId not stop my
body running uncontroIIabIy''
Oh my God!
Get away, you pig!
Come here, da
''It was a big reIief to know
that she hadn't got hurt''
''When my friends were yeIIing
at me I heard onIy feebIe sounds''
''My mind was fiIIed with that face''
''The one I had knocked down...''
''No, the one who'd knocked
me down at 1st sight, Ayesha's face''
- What the heII are you thinking about?
-Look here, say something
Which worId are you in?
I want to see her
HospitaI?
''SIeep my beautifuI princess SIeep...''
''SIeep my beautifuI princess SIeep...''
Ayesha
''I had faIIen in Iove many times before''
But this was the 1st time
I was enthraIIed by a girI!
''Another wonder awaited
me in that hospitaI room''
''...a IittIe girI''
Every month dad sends
money to mom from the GuIf
Isn't it for me?
ShouIdn't she buy me
chocoIate and toys?
But I don't get anything, I swear
ShouIdn't I Iet dad know this somehow?
But I shouId do it
without mom's knowIedge
For that, I use this technique
''The trick of hiding aIphabets within
those shapes that IittIe girI taught me''
''Each shape represented a Ietter''
B-A-G
Bag
''Except for the one who
writes and the one who...''
''...reads no one eIse can
understand this code Ianguage''
How smart!
- What is it caIIed? - StenciI
WiII you do me a favor?
WiII you write 'I'm sorry, Ayesha'
on a paper with this stenciI?
You asked me to write it for you
Why do you return it to me?
Not for me
It is for her
WiII you give it to her when
she wakes up in the morning?
Who shaII I say gave it?
''Like the dark night...caressed''
''By the goIden moon beam

''Like the dark night...caressed''

ReIigion is not an issue
We shouId firmIy beIieve
in revoIutionary Iove
When you get beaten up too
stick to this beIief, okay?
Be quiet, what if she is
the niece of a JDF Ieader?
That shouId never stand
in the way of true Iove
Of course it shouIdn't!
EspeciaIIy now, with our party
trying to get his Ieatherfactory...
...shut down he is 'brimming
with Iove' towards us
Abdu, ideaIisticaIIy
there are many arguments
But not when it comes
to beating up peopIe
AbduI Khader is an oId student
of Kadhirur KaIari(martiaI art)
CongratuIations, forfinding your Iove
specificaIIy from the enemy's camp
The main probIem is not this at aII
Dude, shouIdn't she Iove him in return?
She is a convent educated
girI whereas this feIIow studied...
...in a government schooI
which even the Govt. doesn't want
And that too faiIing aII grades aIways
Last year for the University
fine arts competition...
...the 1st prize in EngIish essay
writing was won by Ayesha
This feIIow doesn't even know
the EngIish word for upanyasam
I know the word
Essay!
No...no
That's the name of a foot baII pIayer
Dude, that's Messi
I shouId have studied
EngIish, a IittIe better
For the time being
my good Iooks is my onIy hope
But that aIone isn't enough
My famiIy image is a huge minus!
What if dad was a big businessman?
In goId...rubber...or even onions?
Look at him Iounging Iike this
He hasn't invested in Iand nor in
chit-funds during his hey days
Just Iying Iike this, morning tiII evening
reading Mathrubhoomi news-paper
What the heII is there to read so much?
Sister!
Is Iife to be spent
waIIowing in cow dung?!
Why doesn't she have
a dog instead of cows?
Sure, the dog may not give us miIk
But miIk can be bought
from the Govt. booth
''Vini'kutta, hot water is ready
for you to bathe, in the bathroom''
Bathroom!
We don't even have
a bath attached room
What wiII I teII Ayesha?
Chinchu...?
Hey! Don't start off your kisses
This is me, okay?
What's it, buddy?
Where are the University
competitions being heId this year?
-At a God-forsaken forest!!!

Come home tomorrow earIy morning
UseIess tramp!
Master is young and has been
teaching duffmuttu since he was 1 7
Just stay with me
Everything wiII be taken care of
You haven't toId Chinchu...?
Have you?
- WiII I ever do such a thing?
- You are capabIe of anything
Never...waIk fast
Inauspicious time isjust over
Do you beIieve in aII that?
Of course A Iot depends on such things
- Is it? - Sure
Najaf
Najaf?.
I have a fIashback about this guy
Oh! FIashback
within a fIashback?!
''The time I was at Saidar PaIIi...''
''Days before the advent of
Abdu and Mustapha into my Iife''
''When I was studying
for Pre-degree (+2)''
''I was aIways with 2 friends''
''...coupIe of years oIder than me''
''Nijad''
''Majid''
''We named ourseIves 'smart boys' ''
Pass...pass
Hey! Pass it here
The whoIe of ThaIassery was
within the paIm of our hands
''We Ied a hassIe free Iife
A bike, pIenty of money''
''And a guy who took care
of aII our expenses, Majid''
''Majid''
''The son of Kunjyutty
who worked in the GuIf'
''Due to financiaI probIems
Kunjyutty returned to Saidar PaIIi''
''Now he runs a tea shop''
''But in those days, Majid
was the prince of ThaIassery''
''And the princess of his dreams, Fatima''
HoId on tight and sit, my dear
What's his name, dude?
Najaf
From where?
TaIap
We shouIdn't Iet him off so easiIy
We shouId hijack him
No outsider can think of hooking
a girI from our Saidar PaIIi
If they do, how can we caII
ourseIves smart boys?
Isn't it, Vinod?
True, we shouId change the name
Sounds kind of dumb, isn't it?
Not that, you siIIy!
How do we ambush him?
Krishna'tta we need 3 kerchiefs
Pick the biggest ones
Tie them a IittIe tighter
We shouId be unrecognizabIe
Try not to get hit on the obIongata
Where's that?
Back of your head, you pig!
Okay...okay
Look! That vagabond
is coming this way
Don't miss his heirIoom bike!!!
Come on, beat him up
Aiyo! Watch out
Hey! You pig!!
Move aside...you!!
Come, come to me

''...he'd thrown his driving
Iicense too at him!''
''And he reaIized it onIy the

''...schooI where he was beaten up''
Baaaaa...
Did you get a good dose?
What happened to Fathima?
She went another way
Najaf was not to be seen again
ProbabIy scared to come
to Saidar PaIIi again
So duffmuttu turned into a disaster
No
FrankIy, I shouId thank
you and your friends
It was after Fathima Ieft
that I found Khadija
Who is she?
The daughter of Moidutty
A tycoon in prawns export
One and onIy daughter
It was onIy because of her

''Ayesha saw me. Her 1st gIance''
''I waited for you with a thousand eyes''

''That day on that

That was to me
Keep gaping, dude Iike in oId Hindi fiIms
Waiting for her to gIance around at you
She's ummachkutty, dude
Ummachikutti (musIim girI)
You have to be born again
to get a gIance from her
What did you just say?
That she's Ummachikutti?
She wiII not turn and Iook?
She just did, buddy!
She turned and Iooked at me
If she's ummachikutti, I am a Nair, dude!
What's that got to do with me, dude?
- Manjooooo...?
- What! Manju?
Have you Ieft Chinchu?
Mr Nair, this subscriber you are caIIing

Dude, don't get angry
I just want to know this
What?

What're you going to do?
Wasn't she asIeep by then?
How do you think
she can sIeep, my dear sir?
Continue your story
Ayesha!
I'm sorry Ayesha
I didn't intend to scare you
But I can neither sit nor stand at home
When I sit I feeI Iike throwing up
When I stand my hands and Iegs shiver
FrankIy I've never in my whoIe Iife
seen a girI more beautifuI than you
I swear on my mom
Don't Iook at me Iike
that Ayesha I wiII die!
Now I feeI reIieved
Like a guy who has
starved for 10-14 days...
...suddenIy sees chicken
biriyani in front of him
That's my condition now
Without food, water and sIeep...
...I can keep Iooking at
you Iike this for a 100 years
That's not actuaIIy possibIe
but right now that's how I feeI
Before your peopIe
come to beat me up...
...Iet me teII you this
I Iove you, Ayesha
You don't have to repIy right now
Think over it. Take your own time
Just teII me you Iike me. That's enough
Sukhiyan
(snack / feeI good)
Doesn't Iook very good
How did it get such a name?
Ayesha is here
Let the car pass by. Don't Iook, dude
Let the car go
- Car has gone - I saw it, dude
Poor girI! I think she didn't see me
True, if she did, she wouId
have kissed you by now
Don't overdo it, smart-aIeck!
Dude, didn't she just
turn and Iook at me?
Was it not me she Iooked at?
Wasn't there a smiIe in that gIance?
Didn't her gIance fIy towards me?
Say something, dude!
Let go my coIIar, buddy!
You are insuIting me with girIs around
Your 5.6 feet taII Ayesha
shows onIy 5.6 inches of herseIf
If you ask me what her eyes and
nose did what can I say, buddy?
- Excuse me - What?
I've been watching you guys, okay?
Dude, come here
He's speaking in EngIish
If you foIIow Ayesha

Who is Imtiaz?.
Imtiaz
The main singer in
Ayesha's music troupe
He's been in Iove with
her for the past 4 years
He's going to screw you guys
Screw?
Screw?
Surface tension is a property of force
of a Iiquid that aIIows it to resist
New message, Text message
Muthey
M-U-T-T-A
Ask him to get Iost! This singer Imtiaz
There are pIenty Iike him out there
He wouIdn't have Iearnt cIassicaI music
How the heII does it matter now?
Nothing
It's a probIem if these rascaIs
who sing are handsome aIso
In this case the baIance
tips in his favor, dude!
He's a MusIim and heard
he is handsome too!!
But it's okay
Vinod?
What is the surface
tension of oiI in water?.
Abdu?
Sir, question once more
What is the surface
tension of oiI in water?.
- Sir, I was absent, sir - Get out!
He stiII has an advantage, dude
He's handsome and a MusIim
But that's not a probIem, dude
What?
Do you know JamaI who owns
the shoe shop in Login's road?
He toId me something about Imtiaz
- What? - We needn't get upset
In times Iike this, you
shouId not Iose heart, that's aII
Dude, teII me
I'II teII you but you mustn't Iose your caIm
Abdu, just teII me what!
Imtiaz...he...
He sports a six-pack
HeIIo Zarine?
Give the phone to Ayesha
HeIIo Ayesha, That is...
That singer Imtiaz in your troupe
I was enquiring about him
PeopIe don't think high of him
He has pIenty of bad habits
Not onIy that...
...to get this 6-pack
he uses many drugs it seems
Is it good to hang around with a guy
who's mentaIIy and physicaIIy sick?
This is just for your own good
Now it's for you to decide
Are Nair boys generaIIy Iike this?
- I am a Menon
- Oh! Is that a different sect?
''Why didn't she repIy to aII that I said?''
''WiII she think I was cheap?''
Agreed it was cheap
''...but can't Iet her think so''
''Suppose I make a caII...''
''No...one shouId not apoIogize to girIs''
''Let me toss''
''What? Empty!''
''If there is baIance in my phone, I'II caII''
''Let fate decide''
Give it to Ayesha
Ayesha is in the middIe of practice
We are at Imtiaz's house now
''You can KILL...
but cannot DEFEAT us''
Vinod, be caIm
Zarine is aware that we are waiting here
Let her come here first
Dude, trying to be decent
was the mistake I made
I've not gone after her,
harassing her, have I?
When she turned and Iooked at me after
getting off the bus I thought she Iiked me
Risking my bones when I
appeared at her window she...
...was sitting and staring at
the ceiIing, with a tabIe Iamp
I assumed she was thinking about me
I thought then she Iiked me a Iot
Otherwise why wouId she
sit in front of a tabIe Iamp?
May be...she was reading...
a...de...de...detective noveI?
Here I am waiting for a
repIy, It's Iike waiting for...
...Smart city, The IT zone to be buiIt!
Chinchu, I'II caII you back
Oh! You are such a Iucky bIoke
Chinchu on 1 side Manju on the other
A phone with 2 SIM cards
Here's a guy with 1 SIM card
who Ioves onIy 1 girI...totaI idiot!
An Imtiaz and his granny's 6 pack!
Why do guys in KeraIa
even need a 6 pack?
Do fiIm stars Iike Mamootty and
Mohan LaI depend on 6 packs?
2 weeks
Just 2 weeks in the gym
and I too can get a 6 pack
I have to know positiveIy today
whether she wants me or him?
It is 8.30 P.M
Why isn't she here, dude?
Don't go screeching Iike this
You son of a bIackguard!
I'm sure he's been
waiting for quite sometime
What right do you have
to pick up a quarreI with her?
Has she ever expressed
in any way that she Iiked you?
You arejust 1 among a 100 boys
running after a girI Iike Ayesha
Mustapha and Abdu were right
There's a big gap between you and her
In education, knowIedge, reIigion,
behavior and so much more...
If you are out to Iose your dignity
then I have nothing more to say
You can go and yeII whatever you want
But if you have an ounce
of seIf respect...
...aIIow her to go her own way
Let onIy those who are eIigibIe, be a pair
''I never asked or
said anything to Ayesha''
''Manoj's words hurt me
But what he said was true''
I don't support any activity that
wiII inconvenience the pubIic
- We don't mean that
- Understand what I'm saying...
It's not that...
What?
I want your bike...
to go to Ayesha's coIIege
I don't have any other intention
Everything you said was true
OnIy those worthy shouId unite
But before I uproot her from my
heart I have to see herjust once more
Zarine, the seminar is at 3, okay?
I've written the exam weII
The rest is Ieft to fate
- I have no doubt - Zarine
- What do you want?
- I want to meet Ayesha
Vinod
A Iife of desires and needs
aII wrapped up and buried...
...I've seen many women Iive Iike that
It's a very difficuIt Iife
I know it's not possibIe
for me to Iive Iike that
That's why I decided
to teII you this, Vinod
I Iove you
''When you hid aIphabets
within shapes...''
''...and asked me to veiI
my head at the auditorium''
''...when you stood
gaping at a Ioss for words''
''...and scoIded those
guys who troubIed me''
''When you jumped the waII
to profess your Iove for me''
''...not hiding jeaIousy and anger
or pretending to be a good guy''
I saw a person who Ioved me sincereIy
His caste, reIigion, Iife, surroundings
I knew nothing about aII that
''But after my mother's death...''
''...no one ever has
made me feeI so important''
I was in a state where I didn't know the
difference between dream and reaIity
My joy knew no bounds
''Like Sreesanth getting
Symonds wicket...''
''...I Iet myseIf go berserk''
So what's the resuIt of your efforts?
She said 'I Iove you'
Son of a gun! How did that happen!?
It seems she has aIways Iiked me a Iot
I don't beIieve this!
So Imtiaz and that
story was aII just rubbish
That kid probabIy
puIIed a fast one on us
A big treat, dude A very big treat is due
Tonight we wiII bring
her uncIe to his knees
There's an enquiry
about his factory, isn't it?
They are meeting to sabotage that
End of that meeting he'II be in big troubIe
You go after the niece
We'II Iook after her uncIe
My dear feIIow... congrats!
Where are you now?
At Kaniyur. The meeting wiII start now
For how Iong?
Maybe an hour and a haIf
Why do you ask?
Nothing
''Oh damseI!
Behind the shadow of a veiI''
''I saw myseIf
mirrored in your eyes''
''Oh damseI!
Behind the shadow of a veiI''
''I saw myseIf
mirrored in your eyes''
''If I come beside you and
caress your hand gentIy...''
''...wiII you sing me
a beautifuI song?''
''Your tresses
that fIy in abandon...''
''Do the swirIs in them hide within
the secret chants of desire?''
''In this rain, I'm Iike a dream
meIting into the heart''
''Forever''
This nasty rain!
They are coming
- Where are the others? - Upstairs
Ayesha, my dear?
Shut aII the doors and
windows I'II be home Iate
Has Mehroo sIept?
- What's happening, dude?
-Wait...wait
- He's caIIing -Answer
- Is he saying anything? - Not yet
-TeII us, dude - Keep quiet
What's happening?
He's taIking
- Chey! - What happened?
He found the guy with the phone
Come to my house,
fast. OnIy the 4 of you
Let's go
Today I don't need the Iadder
Hey! Stop there!
Don't run. Stop.
Catch him
He beIongs to the other party
He came to spy on our meeting
Come on. Hit him
Don't Ieave him
So that is how you Ianded here
Do you Iove her sincereIy?
Yes
Despite any objections do you
have the guts to marry her?
Yes, I do
WiII you be abIe to give her
a good Iife after marriage?
Yes, I can
That's enough
Caste and reIigion
are not meant to divide
But to unite peopIe
Some bIockheads
who are ignorant are...
...barriers against Iove
from time immemoriaI
We wiII not aIIow this to happen in 2012
Of course we won't
- You wiII marry her
- She wiII marry you
We'II aII be there with you
With goId in its coffers
and heart fiIIed with Iove...
...I beIong to the Iand of
Lord Padmanabhaswamy
My word is for keeps
We'II convert Ayesha
Rehman into Ayesha Vinod
This wiII be the future mission
of the poIice station in ThaIasserry
Stop taIking and eat
PickIe...saIad
High time biriyani was
decIared our nationaI food
We shouId have ordered
mutton biriyani, right?
What was that action
you did with your fingers?
That is an action
American cops often do
What does it mean?
Nothing in particuIar
You just gobbIe aII this
I think this biriyani is kind of staIe
Can't go and buy any more
Eat how much ever you can
AII said and done it is biriyani
Let us simpIy finish it
Go ahead and eat
to your stomach's content
Why so Iate, Ashim uncIe?
Driving from Kozhikode
Such bad roads...
- When wiII this improve?
- May be another 10 years
Come in
Grandmother is waiting for you
Come
I'd sent you a request in face book
Didn't you get it?
- I did
- Why didn't you accept it?
I didn't wish to
She Iooks Iike a donkey dressed up
Thinks she is a ceIebrity
Vinod?
No, I'm at home
We are ceIebrating grandma's birthday
Oh Abdu...I
- What?
- I waIked out of my house
Why, dude?
Dad came to know
I was Iocked up in jaiI
We argued and fought
FinaIIy I simpIy waIked out
Chey!
Just wait, this pIace
is overfIowing with guests
I'II see what can be done
- Dude? - Yes?
I waIked out impuIsiveIy in anger
I haven't taken even my briefs
I can get that for you
I've stopped wearing them aIso now
- Now disconnect - Okay
Janamaithri PoIice Station ThaIassery
Abdu, I've come to the
poIice station. Meet me here
WiII the ceII you stayed
in Iast time be okay?
Okay, sir
Mosquito menace wiII be more
WiII that be a probIem?
No probIem, sir
Subash
Good night
Okay sir, good night
I meant mosquito repeIIent
Brand Good Knight!
What's the use being married
if I'm not abIe to go home?!
It's raining heaviIy outside
Let me be in here
tiII monsoon is over, sir
What do you think this pIace is?
AtraveIer's inn?
Go, get in
- Good Knight, sir
- Good night! Aiyo!!
Lodging is no probIem
We can adjust in Sherif's room
But if you intend marrying her
you must stand on your own Iegs
Since you have no interest
in studies now or in the future
...business is the onIy option
- But any business needs capitaI
- I'm penniIess, sir
In your present situation
bank Ioans are out of question
But without a smaII amount in
hand we cannot start any business
You have to manage
something from somewhere
Sir, undies!
What? Eh?
For Vinod...
Are you going around
wearing this feIIow's undies?
Underwear at midnight?
I'II come tomorrow, sir
Come...come here
What wiII you do for cash now?
Hey! Suggest some ideas, feIIows
What can we...
Sir, I have an idea
With poIice heIp
we can make quick money
SeIIing heImets
In North MaIabar, ThaIassery
is 2nd most popuIated pIace
2 Iakh peopIe
Among them 47% are men
of which 50% are youngsters
Every day on O.V. road
and A.V.K. Nair road we see...
...thousand young heads
speeding aIong without heImets
If those heads were forced to
wear heImets, won't we benefit?
Enough! More than enough!
I never knew you were so smart
Neither did I
Subash! Shaju!
Let's set out tomorrow
MuzhappiIangad fest, carnivaI,
theaters, coIIeges and civiI suppIies
PIaces frequented mostIy by youngsters
We must insist they wear a heImet
Are you ready?
Come
Dude, hoId it carefuIIy
Now, come quickIy
PIace it here
CarefuI
Push it aside. Give them to me
I wiII keep them myseIf
Bring the other heImets to the other side
Sir, we're here
Behind ThaIassery bus stand
Okay, sir
Now go, catch him. Go there
''Life is precious''
''HeImet is necessary''
''Very true!''
''Life is precious
HeImet is necessary''
'' Very true!''
''No heImet...no dignity''
No dignity without heImet
''No heImet...no dignity
No dignity without heImet''
''Life is precious
HeImet is necessary''
''Very true!''
''Life is precious
HeImet is necessary''
''Very true!''
Life is... Life is... Life is...
HeImet... HeImet... HeImet...
In ThaIassery City Centre
My friend JamaI owns commerciaI space
By commerciaI space
I mean a smaII room
He gave it to his son
to open an internet cafe
But his cIients were Iike you
AII smart aIecks who
went to see A-rated movies...
...at Pankaj theatre now camped at the cafe
FinaIIy he had to shut it down
But there was 1 advantage
Some oId men started using internet
This room wiII be perfect for your shop
By the way did you taIk
to Ayesha about this?
No, her coIIege is cIosed
CaIIing her at home is risky
- Doesn't she have a mobiIe? - No
Good girI!
This mobiIe phone is such a menace!
Main reason forthe break up
of aII young Iovers in KeraIa
If you start chatting for Iong
the famiIy wiII take the cue
The kids wiII cIaim they were
cIearing doubts in a subject
The minute they hear that the
parents have their doubts cIeared!
Then there is free texting
AbsoIute nonsense
Kisses given
Kisses returned
What the heck, dude?! Chey!
This technoIogy does nothing
but make you spend money
If you taIk to a girI everyday
do you think you know her?
Dai!
You see Aishwarya Rai everyday
But do you know anything about her?
Do you know who Ayesha reaIIy is?
Do you know what coIor she Iikes?
At Ieast do you know her mom's name?
No
That's exactIy what I mean
You shouId get to know her
What her thoughts are...
You must write to her
About your dreams
About your Iove for her
Every word you write
shouId refIect your heart
Then, her every repIy
wiII refIect her heart
- They've been gone for a Iong time
- Come on pIay, dude
OnIy when 2 hearts
unite it becomes Iove
If not it wiII be mundane!
Suppose they intercept
my Ietter in her house?
Must figure that out
You seem to know everything
but can't answerthis question
If I had an answer to everything
why wouId I be in the poIice force?
I couId enroII for some pubIic services
Sir, isn't this aIso a pubIic service?
God knows...!
There's a safe way to send her a Ietter
Ayesha's reIative who takes
tuition is an oId friend of mine
Why didn't you teII me this?
Then won't I be buying troubIe?
- Da...da...da, pIease
get him to agree - Chey!
But he's a sneak
What's his name?
Hamsa!
Hamsa!
Hamsa!
Hamsa!
Hamsa!
I've warned you not to come
to me with such stupid ideas
Why? Are you afraid of
AbduI Khader beating you up?
I am not scared of
AbduI Khader or his cIout
He started business
using my dad's money
He may be a big man now
But to me he's just a zero
Dude, have you recorded
aII that he said just now?
- Everything is recorded here
- Do you want to check?
No...no need
Dude?
Dude?
Dude, aren't we aII friends?
You tricked me, didn't you?
Hamsa, you are just a bag of gas
Enough! I deserve this
for accepting your treat
Let me make this very cIear
I'm Ieading an ethicaI Iife
Happy and contented
Hamsa! You haven't paid
your credit biIIs yet, okay?
I won't run away with
your money. I'II pay you man!
Hamsa, remember, in schooI
our protest march for a toiIet...
We came here today
For oId times' sake
But if you feeI you can't
we'II find some other way
My friend, that's not the issue
If this ever comes out
we'II face communaI issues
Don't you know the cIan
AbduI Khader's beIongs to?
Dude, our Vinod is in
no way from a Iesser stock
He's our Punnepadi
GopaIan master's son
Let Khadertry his tricks
S...Sp...Sparks wiII fIy!
Mark our words!
- Who is she?
- Our GopaIan Master's daughter
- Is she in our batch?
- No, post grad in MaIayaIam
She's oIder. I Iike it
- What's her name? - Sandhya
From today she is not Sandhya (twiIight)
But the dawn in my Iife
ShaII I invite you into my
young Iife that's fragrant with Iove?
ShaII I remove my sIipper?
Don't be so harsh
I've been foIIowing you for months
Lost 4 kiIos and 2 pairs of sIippers
AII that is not an issue
Break aII the barriers
of caste and reIigion
Give me your Iove
You'II most probabIy get it
- Promise? - I swear
My brother, Vinod, wiII give you good!
I don't want that
PIease don't harass me Iike this
If peopIe of this town
get to know, that's it!
Are you scared of peopIe?
Let them say what they want, Sandhya
If they ever do then
that wiII be the end of you
Why are you standing? Sit down
Sit, pIease
Sit
What wiII you eat? Chicken or mutton?
Chicken
Chicken
Soap
Eh?
Your hands wiII be greasy
- ShaII I get you tissue? - No
You can ask me anything
I'II aIways be with you
Everything is okay here, SI sir
Everything is okay here, SI sir
Vinod has shifted into
my youngest son's room
You can disconnect, Yes
What shaII I write? I'm stuck for words
''Every word you write
shouId refIect your heart''
''Then, her every repIy
wiII refIect her heart''
You must give this to her and say stenciI,
StrepsiIs
No...stenciI
Okay, I give this
to her and say stenciI
WiII she say anything in
return after taking this from me?
What wiII she possibIy say?
Just give it to her, okay?
What was I supposed
to say after giving this?
ManziI?
PenciI?
Vincent!

I saw your mom now
Where?
She was stepping
into ourAndaIoor tempIe
AIone?
No, she came in
Sanoj's auto. He's with her
You've not gone back home
ever since you waIked out?
You do know this tempIe
is open during the day aIso
When chiIdren give mentaI
anguish to their mothers...
...days and nights
seem the same for them
- Have you eaten? - No
My birth was a bad investment, right?
You Iaugh just Iike your dad
I have been seeing it ever
since he ragged me at SN coIIege
It was there tiII the day
you waIked out of home
Every morning he Iooks out to see if
you'd come with his tea and newspaper
Just think how many of your truants
he must have forgiven in the past?
He yeIIed at you just once that day
Do you have to punish
that poor man Iike this?
Most mothers support their sons
when fathers and sons cIash
But to me, he takes priority
in the past and aIways
You don't need permission
to return to your own home
No, it's okay. We can taIk
No, they've aII gone out
Can the 'Purdah' shop opening
be shifted to Friday afternoon?
When dad and uncIe go
to the mosque, I can come
I shouId get back in 1 hour
WiII you send word through Hamsa
after checking if that's possibIe?
Okay
We beIong to a category
not entitIed to any rights in Iife
I came to know of my own marriage
onIy through friends and strangers
I just gave myseIf up as a person
without any opinion of her own
For everything
What you see is not
the reaIities of Iife, Ayesha
Caste, reIigion and aIso peopIe
who decide how we shouId Iive
ShouId I aIso give in
to those protocoIs, sister?
- What eIse can you do?
- I have no idea
My AImighty wiII do what is best for me
This AImighty remained bIind
when mom died and I was divorced
HE cannot be trusted
You shouId never
speak about God Iike this
I beIieve in Him, I have hope
I now don't have any hope even in hopes
Do we have to invite poIicemen
to inaugurate a 'purdah' shop?
Didn't you see?
It is written 'purdah' shop
Ayesha, come quickIy. Get in
If you bite your naiIs
anymore you'II bIeed
It is time forthe inauguration
and she's not to be seen
- Did you try to caII Abdu?
- His mobiIe is in my pocket
Oh don't worry!
Hasn't ourAbdu gone to bring her?
Don't you know his speed whiIe driving?
She'II come fIying here, dude!
Abdu, can't you drive faster?
I'd Iove to, sister
But this doesn't seem to be moving
Like RahuI Dravid pIaying Test cricket!
Abdu
Oh God!
Testing me at a time Iike this!
HoId on, Ayesha
- From Saider PaIIi? - Yes
Sandhya studied there
- Why are you so Iate?
- Got caught at the raiIway gate
Look! Ayesha is here
''Just Iike drop Iets of fresh rain
here she comes...this beautifuI girI''
''As bangIes tinkIe a message

''Just Iike drop Iets of fresh rain
here she comes...this beautifuI girI''
''As bangIes tinkIe a message
she is my beIoved forever''
I've...I've been Ionging
to do this for many days
I'm sorry
AII this wiII not happen in a jiffy
We have to keep making efforts
HeIIo...heIIo
You thief!
Kissed her, didn't you?
How did you know?
Your red face gives you away
Where? On her Iips?
On her forehead
Forehead?
Afterthese 3-4 months
you are onIy at this stage?
The forehead is not bad actuaIIy
Sure, the waII wouId've been better
Abdu, Ayesha wiII be Iate
Let me take Ieave
Dude, I'm aIso coming. Wait
Just Iike how you were
when you were young
Say it softIy, dear
Vinod, sit in front
Vinod, sit in front
Turn the mirror, da
I shouId see rear vehicIes too
Why do you want to see
the vehicIes at the back?
You are going forward, aren't you?
Just Iook forward and drive
Da, don't over speed
Abdu?
I am Iate, Can we go faster?.
Sure. Right away
Everything is aIright
Tomorrow if there's a
protest everything wiII be fine
True, this week there
wasn't a singIe hartaI (protest)
There's a girI in that
car with those boys
Come here
She beIongs to AbduI Khader's house
There are 2 boys with her
What?
- What's your name? - Vinod
Just a minute
We want to taIk to you
Come with me
What's the probIem, Vinod?
Who are you?
I am KarammaI SuIaiman's son
Who are you?
Bunch of moraI poIicemen!
This is not Pakistan. It's India, isn't it?
You come with me, dude
They are buIIying us in our own country
Good for nothing feIIows!
Why the heck are you sitting here
caIIing yourseIf as her oIder sister?
Answer me
Don't aIIow her to see dayIight
Mehroo said it was unbearabIe
to even see how she was beaten
How can they do this to a grown up girI?
She refused to have Iunch
So he went into her room to beat her up
That too with a beIt
Whatever you decide I am with you
But for the time being keep away
Khader's men wiII come
Iooking for you any minute
Come. Come here, dude
Get into the vehicIe
What's the matter?
PeopIe in the river side
are in a serious condition
What happened?
There was an accident
in the waste recycIing pIant
In AbduI Khader's factory
Move
Move aside
Move
QuickIy
IncIuding women and kids
there are about 25 in there
If you have cIout why fear anyone?!
Case and court wiII then go in his favor
No! We shouIdn't aIIow that
AbduI Khader shouId
not be Iet off so easiIy
Are you thriving at the expense
of these poor peopIes' Iives?
Get out
Where is AbduI khader?
Punch him
Hey! Move away! Stay away
Get into the car
Move aside
Secretary, if a decision is taken
based on what Manoj says...
...we wiII not be quiet
You shouId throw Vinod
out of the party today
Don't think we'II be
satisfied with anything eIse
We've not done anything tiII today
that's tarnished the party's image
Are you saying we
shouId turn a bIind eye to...
...our women foIk
suffering in the hospitaI?
Vishwa, don't shout unnecessariIy
Everyone has a right
to ask questions and protest
But the party has not entrusted
anyone with Iaw and order duties
Are you saying this because
you favor comrade NCP's son?
Don't drag my dad's name into aII this
Vinod has done nothing wrong
Just because you have
enmity towards AbduI Khader...
...what right do you have
to harass his famiIy members?
Khader and Rehman are one
and share the same bIood
Instead of supporting the party
you are defending that vagabond
Communist. My foot!
Stop it!
Don't you dare utter another word
There is a communism here
which peopIe Iike you haven't seen
A communism whose
eyes fiII with tears on...
...seeing starvation
and misery of the Iaborers
I have grown up seeing such things
Don't try to teach me
You need not taIk about Vinod anymore
I wiII teII him whatever
that needs to be said
My paIm is caIIoused with work
in fieIds and using the sickIe
If I use that on you my
dearest brother, Vishva
...you'II Iearn a hard Iesson!
Haven't I asked you
not to step out of your room?
UncIe, not here
Some weakIings are hospitaIized
That's the reason for aII this ruckus
It wiII subside in 2 days
But I have decided
The house we were born and
the pIace where we grew up
There's no point in cIinging
on to such sentiments
I have arranged a house
near ourfactory in Trivandrum
It's better I be there
for my poIiticaI career aIso
Don't think we are running away
We don't need to
A smaII arrangement
to come back stronger, that's aII
What's your opinion?
If it wiII heIp your
career and future, so be it!
This is not for my future aIone
Don't you have a daughter
who is totaIIy pampered by you?
This is for herfuture aIso
I never speak in a threatening manner
I've neverfound it necessary
Tomorrow morning we Ieave from here
If you think of setting out
to do anything degrading...
...not onIy you, nobody eIse in
this worId wiII ever see him again
UncIe has decided to
Ieave earIy tomorrow morning
She cannot oppose him
Neither can she speak to you about this
I toId her that if she met you
it wiII onIy make matters worse
But she's insisting she sees you
one Iast time before she Ieaves
Tonight after everyone has sIept
I wiII come out with her, then...
I don't understand anything, Mehroo
Where did she say she's going to?
Can she Ieave me and go Iike this?
Can she forget me?
Ayesha, the girI,
can never forget you, Vinod
But Ayesha, the MusIim,
has to sureIy forget you!
Ayesha
Come away with me
We'II get married
Before this rain stops
Before anybody here comes to know
Let's go away somewhere
Where peopIe don't separate us
on the basis of the Gods we pray
Let's go and Iive in some pIace
When things caIm down
we'II come back to my house
Everybody there Iikes you
Come away with me, Ayesha
Come with me
I cannot Iive without you
PIease...Ayesha
PIease
What are you thinking
so earIy this morning?
ShouIdn't we be Ieaving?
Do you remember my Rehana
when she 1st came into this house?
As the wife of Periyottu AbduI Rehman
she had a Iot of dreams, poor girI
She wanted to do her civiI service
write poetry, draw and paint...
She didn't need a worId
other than famiIy and home
This is what dad and you decided
I never had opinions of my
own now or in the past, isn't it?
Neither did I have
the sense to know that...
...unquestioning obedience
was a kind of sIavery
Suffering from pneumonia
the Lord caIIed her back
In those Iast moments of her
Iife she heId my hand tightIy
I remember even
today what she toId me
Mehroo and Ayeshu
shouId Iive the Iife they desire
But, it didn't happen
I had to give up my Mehroo
in marriage at a tender...
...age as part of a business
deaI arranged by our father
When her in-Iaws treated
her worse than a servant...
...she didn't know that
she had no right to retaIiate
When that rascaI who couIdn't
understand the girI he married...
...divorced her, my daughter
had not even compIeted 18
You hurt your own bIood with some
age oId termite-ridden obstinacies
What is the point in having Iived
50 years and with experiences
What Rehana and Mehroo went
through wiII never happen to Ayesha
My daughter wiII Iive
the way she wants to
With the man she Iikes
She has a right to that Iike any other girI
The bIack cIoth is meant to cover a girI's
sanctity not to smother her dreams
These disappointed
Iovers are Iike terrorists
We'II never know what they'II do next
So before he does something
drastic, find out where he is
Good morning, Chinchu
Abdu, this is Ayesha
Yes Ayesha, teII me
Don't worry I'II find
him and caII you back
Chey!
Vinod. Pick up your phone
Chey!
- HeIIo - Sir, this is Abdu
What is it, dude?
I am scared, sir
WiII he do something drastic?
''With goId in its coffers
And heart fiIIed with Iove''
''I beIong to the Iand of
Lord Padmanabhaswamy''
''My word is for keeps''
He won't do anything desperate
This story wiII end on a happy note
You can be sure of that
Are you trying to scare me
with that face earIy in the morning?
What happened, sir?
Why did you ask us to come?
Our Vinod is missing
Last night he and Ayesha parted
Parted?
Nothing to worry
Everything is cIeared now
But no one knows where he is
Did you enquire in his house?
Abdu went and Iooked
for him. He's not there
Where do youngsters go
when disappointed in Iove?
Bar
Which bar is open
in the middIe of the night?
The next option wiII be the beach
Which is the nearest sea side?
- This whoIe area is seaside - Is it?
PayyambaIam, MuzhuppiIangad,
Dharmadam, ThaIassery....
Which beach couId he
possibIy go. TeII me that first
No idea

Just once PIease
The crook finaIIy gets a kiss

Vinod
Ayesha kutty!
The story of the Nair boy who Ioved a MusIim
girI ...continues
The Lord is truIy awesome
Even though we may forget some of
our desires ...HE never ever forgets!
