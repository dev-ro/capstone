- Good morning, killers.
- Keep it down, you jerk.
Where's your dad's car?
- It seems I picked up a little
front end damage somewhere,
so I dropped it off at my cousin's garage.
- Hey, guys, I think we lucked out.
- Nothing in the papers?
- Not a word in the papers
or on the radio.
Nothing about our little
nocturnal adventure.
- Maybe he's not dead.
Maybe he just went home or something.
- Are you kidding?
When Jimbo wastes them, they stay wasted.
- Jim's right.
Deranged but right.
That guy didn't do any walking last night.
Hey Jim, I was wondering,
where are your dad's wheels?
- As I was telling racket-brain, here,
I ditched the deathmobile at my cousin's.
Well, would love to sit and
chat with the brain trust, here,
but I think I'll order myself
some breasts and thighs.
(chuckling)
- What an ass.
- Well, at least he got rid of the car.
Last thing we need is attention.
- I could think of something we need now.
- Oh damn, I need to get to the academy.
Mrs. Goldstein's coming
in at three o'clock.
Are you coming?
- I'll quit but the day is young.
- Excuse me.
- Come on, Mags, I promise you.
You've never seen anything like it.
- Look, Jim,
I prefer men with ones that can be seen
without the aid of an electron microscope.
- Yeah, that's all right, baby.
I'll make you beg for it.

- I've been working
here for 20 long years.
Long before they had
this big fancy building.
They even had dirt courts
and we aint never had no
trouble like that here before.
- And this Peter Winston,
he have a habit of staying late?
- Only when he had reason to, officer.
If you know what I mean.
Him and the girl,
they closes this place up many times.
- And you didn't hear anyone
come in or out after closing?
- No, sir.
I was up in my room resting my feet
before I went on my rounds.
And I heard them screaming,
but it wasn't unusual
to hear them screaming,
if you know what I mean, officer.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Killjoy, you wanna keep
the press back, please?

- Yeah?
- Forensics are just about finished.
The M.E. wants to see you inside.
- Great.
Look,
keep an eye on my star
witness, here, okay?
- Say, officer, can I go now?
- Soon.
I've got a few more questions.
(camera snapping)
Wishful thinking, doc?
- Ah, Frank.
Nice to see you could make
it to the clambake, here.
- What the hell else would I be doing
at three o'clock in the morning?
I see your boys in white
are moving right along.
- Well you probably noticed
the lovely lady on her way out.
Now the boys are trying to fish lover boy
out of a swimming pool full of blood.
You get anything out of good old Joe?
- Oh, old Joe is a wealth
of useful information.
Do you know how many times they
refinish the floors in here?
(chuckling)
Anyway,
according to Joe,
nobody came in, no one could get in.
Bodies A and B stayed late
for a post game celebration,
as was their habit.
- Yeah.
- Old Joe is sleeping like a baby.
Never heard a thing.
- Very helpful.
- Yeah.
- So, what do you think?
Double suicide?
- Oh, sure, sure.
Lover boy smashes her head
in with a baseball bat
then snaps his own neck
with his bare hands
and throws himself in
the pool out of remorse.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Bare hands?
- From the looks of it, yeah.
- So unless old Joe is

- What're you talking about?
- That big goon we
flattened the other night.
I guess we didn't finish
the job after all.
- Oh my god.
Psycho might be right.
- I thought you said
no one knew it was us.
I thought you said that no one saw us!
- Please, babe, calm down.
Honey, just go in the car, all right?
I'll be with you in a minute.
Just go and sit in the car, all right?
- [Jim] Tough broad, man.
- Forget her.
What are we gonna do about our big friend?
- Or friends, man.
I say let them come.
I just might scalp me a few.
- Christ, man, put that thing away.
Someone killed Peter and Susie.
This isn't a game.
- Lay off, man.
- I just want you to chill out.
- No way.
- Why, Jimbo?
- Why?
Because I'm having a good time.
(somber rock music)
- Hey, hand off, dirt bag!
- Come on, Mags, why
don't you give me a try?
- How old are you?
- 21.
- 17 is more like it.
Right?
Look, you may be tough
but I don't rob the cradle.
I'm old enough to be your older sister.
- I like that.
I've always wanted to make
it with my older sister.
- Can't you get it through your head?
I don't wanna see you.
- Yeah,
well you're not gonna do any
better in this town, baby.
- I'm really sorry,
but my religion forbids
interspecies mating.
- You're smart, aren't you?
But you'll have it and you'll love it.
What're you looking at?
Eat your ice cream!
(police sirens alarming)
(knocking)
- Come in.
- This is the report
on our double suicide.
Coroner fixes the death at about 12:30 AM.
Brain death caused the the
cervical vertebra being crushed.
Forensics found lots
of prints on the scene
but few of them are clear enough to trace.
The few fingerprints we
did get all trace back
to members of the academy, employees.
We've had men checking them out.
They all seem to have pretty good alibis
as to where they were last night.
And I checked with mental health
to see if they had any sizable
lunatics running around
but they didn't have any
loose nuts to fit our needs.
- Are you telling me in
your quant way, Frank,
that we don't have any leads?
- Ah,
yeah.
But Cap,
where did the newspapers get
the drug and suicide story?
- I gave it to them.
- You gave it to them?
I don't understand.
- Frank, this Winston
boy ran with a bad crowd.
High school kids running
red lights, getting drunk,
smoking marijuana.
You know, the usual bad stuff.
Murder's a whole new ballgame.
Till we get a line on this killer,
I want the press to get
nothing but misinformation.
Otherwise, they'll make
this guy a serial killer
or a goddamn vigilante savior.
- What about the public's right to know?
- Hey, we're concerned with
the public's right to live.
I've spoken with the parents.
They've told me they're gonna cooperate.
The last thing I want
is for this kid's gang
to go looking for revenge.
- Yeah.
Well, whatever you say, Cap.
I've got an APB out on anyone big enough
to snap a person's neck.
That oughta clear out
half the health clubs
and all the high school teams.
- Okay, Frank.
I think you're big enough
to handle this by yourself.
- Well,
I'm going out now and buying
some anabolic steroids.
- Frank?
Let's not have any more high
school kids turn up dead.
Understand?
(ominous music)
(crickets chirping)
- No.
Go home.
Don't look at him now.
His body is growing too many changes.
Just be patient.
We will have revenge.

if it wasn't for the giant.

- Hey, Frank.
Morning.
What do we got here?
- Well,
she claims he tried to rape her.
That checks out with what
the owner of this place
tells me about our boy, Jim, here.
He used to come around with
his gang and bother the girls.
- Yeah.
Did that frail young
thing impale Jimmy boy
with a baseball bat?
- She claims it was the Jolly Green Giant.
- Christ on a crutch, Frank.
- You believe her?
- Hell no.
These kids are so whacked out on drugs,
they don't know what they see.

this is one kid you're gonna

that this was a
drug-induced hallucination.
- Jesus.
Jim Batten.
I've known his family all my life.
- Sorry, Doc.
- For what?
The kid was a bum.
He was a disgrace to his family.
Hey, maybe he impaled
himself with a baseball bat,

- [Bob] Amy, calm down.
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
Jim's dead, Bob!
Didn't you hear it on the radio?
The found his body behind the drive-in.
He's dead!
- Hey, baby, just try and relax.
- Relax?
Don't you understand, we're next!
He's killed Pete and
Susie and Jim. We're next!
- [Mother] Who's on the phone, dear?
- It's Amy, ma.
- [Mother] Oh, well
say hello for me, dear.
- [Bob] My mother says hello.
- Are you crazy?
Don't you see that we're next?
- All right.
Where are you?
- I'm at home.
- [Bob] Is there anyone there?
- No.
I'm alone.
My mother went to--
- Good, now listen.
Stay where you are. I'm coming right over.
Lock the doors and don't
let anyone in, okay?
- Okay.
- I'll be right there.
- Hey, don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen to us.
(somber rock music)
(phone ringing)
(grunting)
(thudding)
- Hey!
(thudding)
(yelling)
(groaning)
- Take a good look, Frank.
There's your killer.
- Him?
(yelling)
- James Earl Powell.
We picked him up in New Castle.
He was trying to rob
a check cashing store.
James is a very bad boy.
He was on probation.
- Let me guess, assault.
- Yeah, right.
Seems he likes to beat
up people and rob them.
You may have noticed,
James is a terrifyingly strong dude.
- Then why did he kill the kids?
Then why did he kill the kids?
You know none of them were robbed.
- I don't know, maybe he
was working for somebody.
Maybe he's got a new hobby.
We've got him now and we'll find out
just as soon as he talks.
What's the matter, Frank?
A little flesh wound
because you couldn't
solve this case yourself?
Look,
the object is to clear these
cases as soon as possible.
- Maybe too soon.
- You trying to say we got the wrong man?
- Look, I just don't think that
Mr. James there is our man.
- Do you have somebody else in mind?
- No, it's just a feeling, that's all.
- Feeling?
Oh yes.
Feeling.
Must be that policeman's
intuition you developed
after all these years on the force.
Come on, Frank.
You're just a little
ticked because you couldn't
grab the brass ring and
solve this case yourself.
Come on, you've got a
lot of years ahead of you
to blow cases.
Just be happy this one's solved.
- If it is over.
- Come on, Frank.
I'll buy you a drink.
- Okay.
(groaning)
- Bad boy.
(thudding)
(yelling)
(groaning)
- Get him!
(grunting)
(yelling)
(restaurant commotion)
- Well here's to the ones who got away.
How long's it been, Frank?
- I don't know.
Two years.
- You'll get over it.
Took me about two centuries,
but it'll work.
Hey!
Hey, come on, this is a celebration.
The case is closed.
- I know, I'm sorry.
Cap, you shoulda seen it.
I mean, this kid was
impaled with baseball bat.
I just don't understand how this guy,
James Earl, could do it.
- Maybe James Earl has
a great batting average.
- Cap, this wasn't like anything.
I mean, look at this kid.
He's got a baseball bat shoved
right through his stomach.
- Frank, I did not come here
to look at dirty pictures.
You take enough of that
stuff home with you,
pretty soon there's not gonna
be anything else at home.
Hey!
This I a celebration.
Hey!
Hey, the case is closed.
- All right.
- Hey!
(ominous tribal music)
(growling)
(crickets chirping)
(sighing)
- This case isn't closed.
(suspenseful beat music)
Wait a minute.
(chuckling)
Thank God.
I thought I was going crazy.
- Frank, are you crazy?
Those goddamn pictures again?
Is this why you dragged me
out of bed this time of night?
I've gotta be back in here at
six o'clock in the morning!
- Cap, Cap, look, just hear me out.
All I want is permission
to pick up this women for questioning.
Her name's Molly...
(ominous music)
Something.
(ominous music)
- [Young Cap Voiceover]
Don't be so upset, babe.
Hey, if you're gonna come
into my neighborhood,
you gotta pay the toll.
- [Molly Voiceover] Get off!
- [Young Cap Voiceover]
Get her over in the bushes.
- [Young Molly Voiceover] Help!
Somebody help me!
- [Bill Voiceover] Tony, stay with mommy.
- Mokembe.
Molly Mokembe.
- You know this woman, Cap?
- Know her?
Sure.
She's some kind of voodoo palm reader
in the black section of town.
I ran into her a couple of times
but she has nothing to do with this case.
- I don't know, Cap.
I mean, this woman was at
the scene of both murders
and they took place miles apart.
- Who knows?
Maybe the batty old broad likes
to follow ambulances around.
Besides, we have our
murder, Frank, remember?
You know, if you give this
kind of stuff to the press,
they're gonna have a field day with you.
She's a harmless old coconut, believe me.
- I just wanted to be
thorough, that's all.
- You are thorough, Frank.
But you don't look too good.
Why don't you go home
and take a little rest?
- Sure.
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry, Frank.
Just go get some rest.
That's an order.
- Good night, Cap.
(eerie music)
(foreboding music)
(phone ringing)
(ominous music)
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
(phone ringing)
Yeah, what is it?
- Fred, it's me.
How's Mary taking it?
- Tom,
you know women.
She hated the creep but she fell apart.
She's at her mother's.
I hear you have a suspect.
- What we have here is trouble.
Molly Mokembe's mixed
up in your son's death.
- [Fred] Jesus Christ.
- So Fred, I want you to get
the hell out of there now
and get down here to the station.
We're gonna find this witch
and settle this thing tonight.
- I'm out the door.
(ominous music)
(gun clicking)
(growling)
(suspenseful music)
(gunshot booming)
(suspenseful beat music)
(growling)
(growling)
(suspenseful music)
(grunting)
(cracking)
(menacing music)
(crickets chirping)
- What the hell took you so long?
- I was trying to get my mom's cash card
so we can get the hell out of town.
- Bob, you're not kidding, are you?
- Amy, I think you're right.
Someone is trying to kill us.
Because Jim tried to make a
speed bump out of that clown
and I do not wanna die.
- Where are we going? When are we leaving?
- We could go right now but I don't think
we're gonna get very far on 20 bucks.
- What about your mom's cash card?
- I said I tried to
get my mom's cash card.
I couldn't.
Don't you have any cash around here?
- Take a look around.
I hardly even see my parents.
Great, we're stuck.
- No way.
Jim was telling me we should
knock over his uncle's garage
if ever we needed money
and we need money now.
- His uncle's garage?
- Jim always had it figured out.
Said he was saving it for an emergency.
- Well this is an emergency.
- Let's do it.
(ominous music)
- This is Charlie 117, come in.
I knew it.
I'll be right there.
(siren alarming)
(tires screeching)
(suspenseful music)
(camera snapping)
Killjoy, get those people out of here!
Jesus.
- Frank.
We got another one just
like the last three.
- Neck broken?
- Yeah, like a twig.
- How old of kid?
- I'd say about 43.
- What?
An old man?
- Yeah.
- Hey, thanks, Frank.
We can't all look as
young as you, you know.
- Look, do you think
this could have been done
by the same assailant at the others?
- I'd stake my semi-professional
reputation on it.
- Thanks, Doc.
So who is this guy?
- That's the kicker.
He's the last kid's father.
Hey, Frank.
Don't you wanna check the house?
- I'm more interested in the crowd.
- Come on, Amy, we'll buy you clothes
wherever the hell we wind up.
- Should I leave a note for my mom?
- Nah, she'll just think you
got lost in a pile of laundry.
Come on, let's go.
(suspenseful music)
See?
No prob.
The extra key was right where
old Jim said it would be.
- Old dead Jim.
- Yeah, well we're not gonna
end up like Jim, you hear me?
Let's just get his cash
and, babe, we are history.
(suspenseful beat music)
- This is a big garage.
- Yeah, a little too big.
- I wonder where they keep their money.
- Yeah, good question.
A little too good.
(menacing music)
(growling)
We're never gonna find this
money if we don't split up.
I'm gonna go check over here.
You go check over there.
Just check around, okay?
- This place is creepy.
I don't wanna go there by myself.
- Jus do as I told you, okay?
Go, go ahead.
(suspenseful music)
(growling)
(ominous music)
(growling)
(thudding)
(groaning)
(screaming)
(growling)
(ominous music)
(garage door rattling)
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)
(screaming)
- Help!
Somebody!
No!
No, help!
Help!
(growling)
(growling)
(ominous beat music)
(squelching)
- Police!
Hands in the air!
(screeching)
(body thudding)
- Oh shit!
(growling)
(groaning)
(snarling)
- Well, looky here.
Aren't you in the wrong
neighborhood, little girl?
Looks like I missed
the start of the party.
Why don't you show me
where the guests are going?
Get in the car, witch!
- Yes, Mr. Churchman.
(suspenseful music)
(foreboding music)
(frogs croaking)
(crickets chirping)
(ominous music)
- Don't be afraid, Frank.
He won't bite you.
- Cap?
Wha?
- The voodoo woman explained it to me
on the way over, Frank.
She made this kid a zombie
so it would avenge itself
against its murderers
and avenge her against me.
- Against you?
- It's a long and sad old story, Frank.
From before I was on the force.
A very sad story.
- He killed this boy's father
for trying to save my life.
- That's true, Frank,
but you see, zombies loose their energy
after they revenge themselves.
So there will be nobody around
to revenge old Molly Mokembe.
This case is closed, Frank.
(gunshot booming)
(ominous music)
(growling)
- This is the last evil
you will do on Earth,
Mr. Churchman.
(foreboding music)
(growling)
(growling)
(steam hissing)
(suspenseful music)
(booming)
(frogs croaking)
- [Frank] What're you gonna do now, Cap?
You gonna kill me too?
- I've got no choice, Frank.
Come on, Frank, take it like a man!
(growling)
(gunshots booming)
(suspenseful music)
(roaring)
- Churchman!
(gunshot booming)
(gasping)
- Frank!
Help!
Frank! Frank!
Help!
(growling)
Frank! Frank!
Help me, Frank!
(growling)
Frank!
Kill me!
Kill me, Frank!
Frank!
(roaring)
