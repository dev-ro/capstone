- Come on! Are youse ready?
- Aye! Aye!
On your marks!
Get set!
Go!
Yeah!
Stew, Dr. Garrigan?
- And you, Dr. Garrigan?
- Hmm.
I, uh-
- I thought that-
- Mother.
Seeing as we have something to celebrate,
we might have a wee drop.
- Sherry.
- Right. Right.
Uh-huh. Your mother and I
are very proud of you, Nicholas.
- Very proud.
- Not quite as good a degree as mine...
but a fine one
nevertheless.
Being a family doctor-
Well, let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.
If you'll both raise your glasses...
a toast.
To father and son.
A long future together.
Nicholas, are you all right in there?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Okay. First place you land,
you go.
First place you land,
you go.
Canada.
What are all the soldiers for?
- Excuse me. Do you speak English?
- Yes.
What are all the soldiers for?
The army's taking over.
There is a coup.
- A coup? What, are we safe?
- Don't worry.
These are General Amin's men.
He fights for the people.
It's a very happy day
for us.
- Is that him?
- Yes.
- What do you do in Scotland?
- Well, I'm a doctor.
- A qualified doctor.
- Oh.
Yeah. I thought maybe
use my skills here, you know?
Monkeys! Look! Look up there, Tolu. Look.
Do you have monkeys
in Scotland?
No, we don't have monkeys in Scotland.
No. If we had monkeys
in Scotland...
we'd probably
deep-fry them.
I think
I'm gonna like it.
This is my stop.
I'm a medical officer
overseas!
Dr. Garrigan?
- Uh, Dr. Merrit.
- No, I'm Sarah, David's wife.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
David was called out
on an emergency.
- I hope everything's okay.
- Yeah. Just normal business around here.
Safe journey?
- Uh, well, you know, it was-
- Bloody awful.
Goat up your ass and your face
in someone's armpit.
Last time I did that trip,
I nearly asphyxiated.
Right. Hop in.
Actually, I waited
for the bus yesterday too.
- Oh, yeah?
- We were getting a little worried about you.
Thought you might have
got caught up in the coup.
It's official now, by the way.
Obote's out. Radio's full of it.
Who's Obote?
- Ex-president.
- Oh, right. And, uh, what's his name.
Amin. He's taken over.
Yeah?
You've certainly come
at a busy time.
Whatever I can do
to help.
- Morning, Nicholas.
- Morning.
- So, what do you think?
- Aye. Aye, fine.
Come on. Come through.
This is
the operating room.
Simple procedures
for the most part.
- Ah, morning.
- Morning.
If you don't mind me asking,
how many doctors are there here?
Well, there's me, and, uh-
and now there's you.
- Good morning, Sister. Good morning.
- Morning.
You know, the, uh,
interesting thing is...
80% of the locals still prefer
the witch doctor to us.
Sometimes I think we're just...
skimming the surface of an ocean.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
There we are.
Whoo.
- There we go. Okay.
- Over here. Okay.
Yes, thank you.
And-
Okay, and one more. Okay, who's next?
That's a lovely name.
Can I just see your-
Yeah?
Nicholas, are you ready?
Dr. Merrit.
What is it?
- Complications with the Magisha baby.
- I'll go.
No, no. I'd better go.
I know the mother.
Ah, sorry. I'll be back
in an hour or two.
Bonny.
Jump in.
- Hi, Bonny.
- Hi.
Mmm.
- I hope you don't mind me saying this, but-
- Yeah?
You seem an unlikely candidate
for this kind of work.
Why? 'Cause I don't wear
socks and sandals?
Touchi.
I still want to make
a difference, you know.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
Want to have fun, too, though.
Bit of adventure.
Something different.
That's a lot of things.
Is it?
Yeah!
It's a beautiful goal
for Scotland!
Yeah!
That's a good one.
Hey, Bonny, why are the women singing?
You don't know?
The president is coming to the village.
Where's Dr. Merrit?
- He has gone to town for stores.
- Right.
Come on. I thought you might be
slightly curious to see the new boss.
I don't work for Amin.
Right. Fine.
Just thought
it might be... fun.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Amin!
Amin! Amin!
Amin! Amin!
Amin! Amin!
And I want to promise you...
this will be a government
of action, not of words.
We will build new schools,
new roads!
And new houses!
I may wear...
the uniform...
of a general...
but, hey-
In my heart,
I am a simple man.
Like you.
I know who you are
and everything that you are.
I am you.
Ask my soldiers.
All my life...
I never eat food
until my soldiers have eaten first.
It will be like this
in Uganda now.
Together, we will
make this country better.
And stronger!
And free!
Whoo! Whoo!
- Have you seen enough now?
- What?
Have you seen
enough now?
Just- Just a couple
of minutes.
Whoo!
Whoo.
- Can we please go now?
- Okay.
They sang just like that
for Obote...
until they realized that he turned
their economy into a personal bank account.
Oh, come on. Give the man a chance.
I'm serious.
You talk to me in a couple of years.
What's going on?
Jesus.
What's the problem?
They're looking for a doctor.
The president's been hurt
in an accident.
We have to come. We'll follow you?
God. How terrifying.
My hand!
- Whoa. Whoa.
- My hand is broken!
Get that farmer out of my sight!
Hey. Hey.
Come. Come here.
My name's Dr. Garrigan.
I hear you have a problem with your hand.
I'd like to examine it. Hmm?
There you go.
Okay, now do a fork.
Raise your thumb like that.
Okay. How's that?
Sarah, I think we're gonna
need a splint here.
Please, can somebody do something
about that bloody cow?
I don't think you've broken it.
I think it's just sprained.
Please! It's in pain!
Can you just hold that now with your other hand?
Sarah, can you go and talk
to that farmer about his cow, please?
Sarah, how's it goin'?
Will somebody please
put that animal out of its misery!
I'm trying
to explain to them!
For God's sake!
I'm sorry. I-
- I couldn't hear myself think.
- You took my gun.
- Yeah.
- Who are you?
Nicholas-
I'm Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.
I work at the medical compound in Mgambo.
I'm a doctor.
You are British.
Brit- Uh, well-
I'm Scottish.
I'm Scottish.
- Scottish?
- Yeah.
Why didn't you say so?
I fought with the Scots against the Mau Mau.
Great soldiers.
Very brave.
And good people.
Completely.
Let me tell you, if I could be anything
instead of a Ugandan...
- I would be a Scot, my friend.
- Right. Really?
Except for the- the red hair...
which I'm sure is attractive
to your women...
but which we Africans-
We find this quite disgusting.
Thank you, Dr. Garrigan.
A very good job.
Hey, please.
Would you let me
have this T-shirt?
My son, Campbell,
he would love this T-shirt.
- You've got a son called Campbell?
- Yeah.
Maybe you would take my-
my shirt here in exchange.
Right. Of course.
Yeah.
- Ah.
- Thank you.
Aha. You see?
Now you are a general, like me.
- Salute, please.
- Oh.
Now I must leave.
And I bet you
that's worth a few bob.
Yeah.
Hmm.
I still can't believe
how you shot that cow.
You're mad.
Um, anyway,
I think I have to go.
- Do you fancy a wee drink on the porch?
- No, thank you.
I'm okay. Really.
I- Nicholas.
I have to go. No.
Look, it's fine,
all right?
We're just havin' a drink.
Oh, God.
- I can't do this.
- What?
My husband
is a good man.
Oh, Christ.
I sound ridiculous.
I guess I-
I guess I just need you
to understand why I'm here.
- It's okay. I do understand.
- No, you don't.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
It's just, sometimes...
when you're married
to such a very good man...
it's-
- It-It makes you feel-
- Like shit.
My father's the same.
And...
it's nice to be noticed.
- Mmm. No, I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Sarah.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.
- No, I don't-
- Sarah, it's fine.
Don't, please.
Please.
Nicholas.
Nicholas, there are some people here to see you.
Be, um,
right there, David.
Right. Right.
- Good morning, Dr. Garrigan.
- Morning.
My name is Jonah Wasswa,
Minister of Health here in Uganda.
I've been sent by His Excellency,
President Amin.
- There is something he would like
to ask you in person. - Wh-What?
Sarah?
Oh, hey. Listen.
Why don't you tell David
to rearrange the field trip for Friday?
All right? I'll be back
as soon as I can.
He probably just wants me to retie his bandages.
Okay, I'll see you later.
My name is Masanga.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nicholas.
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Nicholas.
Welcome
to the president's car.
- They think you are the president.
- Eh?
They think you are the president.
The president's house.
Please sit down.
His Excellency
will be with you in a moment.
- And who's this?
- Oh. Dr. Junju, the previous incumbent.
- Of what?
- Of the post...
of personal physician to the president.
Hold on to your guns!
Everyone!
Hold on to your guns!
- Good to see you again, Dr. Garrigan.
- You too.
You see, Jonah? This is the sort of man
a president needs around him-
someone who is not afraid
to speak his mind.
So, what do you say,
Nicholas?
Will you take the job?
Wha- I'm sorry.
Um-
- You want me to be your physician?
- Mmm.
- Do you want to be of service to Uganda, Dr. Garrigan?
- Yes, I do.
Then what better way...
than to look after the health
of its president?
And let me tell you,
it will not be a difficult job.
Because me, myself,
I am a man...
in perfect physical condition.
Also, I know precisely
when I will die.
It came to me in a dream.
So, you do not have to worry
about making a mistake.
- I'm really sorry. I'm-I'm very honored, but-
- Nicholas.
I understand.
Me, myself, I did not
want to be president.
But the people,
they wanted it so.
Listen to me.
This is very important.
Here, in Kampala...
you will have a hand
in creating...
a new health service
for this country-
something that will help
millions of people.
I'm sorry. I really do have a commitment
to the mission in Mgambo.
I'd be lettin' them down
horribly. You see?
Ah.
It's the woman,
the one I saw you with.
You want to get back
to be with her.
Well, not entirely.
It's the woman.
It's the woman.
Why don't you tell her
to come and be here with us?
Uh, well, it's not
that simple.
- It's quite complicated actually.
- Why?
- Is she married?
- Yes, she is.
Ah, Doctor.
Doctor, you-
you are very naughty.
Me?
Ah, now you are
even more interesting.
Married women, they are always
the most passionate, huh?
Yes.
- It's true.
- They are so grateful, huh?
Hmm. Yes.
I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry
for wasting your time.
No, no.
My car will take you back
first thing in the morning.
But, in the meantime-
Tonight, we are having a state dinner.
Please, would you
join us there?
I'd very much like that.
Thank you.
You have a suit?
Dark suit?
- No. No, I don't.
- Hmm.
How much is this gonna
cost me, by the way?
It's okay.
It's the president's account.
- Oh, can I just-
- Hey! Stop!
- What's goin' on?
- Obote's men.
- They're everywhere.
- Really?
Yep. They're communists,
you know?
Mind you, Amin's
more than a match for them.
He's ex-British army-
King's African Rifles.
- Uh, Jamshid.
- Yes, sir?
Pack those up and have them sent to the
High Commission in the morning, please. Thanks.
Yes, he's a little
unpredictable...
but he's got
a firm hand.
Only thing the African really understands.
- Thanks, Jamshid.
- You're welcome.
Yeah, up yours too, pal.
Bloody English.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello there.
How do you do?
- Ah! Nicholas.
- Oh!
- I'm so happy you came.
- So am I.
Please. Please, this way.
I want to introduce you to my wives.
Excuse me. Here.
This is Malyamu.
She is my first wife.
She has given me five children.
Hello.
And this one- Nora.
She has given me three.
Hello.
And that here
is Kay. Yes.
- This is Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.
- Hello.
- He saved my life.
- Oh, wel- Really, I just stitched his hand up.
- It was-
- Don't be so modest.
I believe it is you
I have to thank for the T-shirt.
Oh, right.
So you must be Campbell's mother.
- Yes.
- It's a pleasure meeting you.
Please come. I have to introduce you
to some people here.
Excuse me.
- This is, uh, British High Commissioner, Mr. Perkins.
- How do you do?
Please, meet my good friend
Dr. Nicholas Garrigan.
And his colleague
Mr. Stone.
- How do you do?
- Fine. Yes, we've already met.
- Well, I will talk with you later.
- Oh, right.
So, uh, Dr. Garrigan, we've been hearing
all sorts of things about you.
Yes, I, uh- I gather the president
has clasped you to his bosom.
Uh, no, no.
Not exactly.
What do you
make of him?
Well, I think he's doing
rather a great job.
- Don't you?
- Yes. He has some issues to be sorted out.
But, no, he plays
a pretty straight bat.
- Yes, definitely one of us.
- Anyway...
it's very good to, uh,
have another Englishman around.
- Scot.
- What?
I'm a Scotsman.
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends.
I am speaking with you now
because if I wait until later...
you will be too drunk
to hear my voice.
- Here is where civilization began.
- Yes.
Here in Africa.
Here is where the Greeks
stole their philosophy...
and the Arabs took
their medicine.
We Ugandans must be more proud
of this history.
We are an independent
African nation...
living in peace
and economic power.
- Black power.
- Yes.
Just like all you people
thought would never be possible.
And now we will go through
to dinner.
The food tonight,
it is all local...
special food.
And none of it
is human flesh.
This is my last.
Dr. Garrigan. Please come quickly.
The president is very sick.
They have poisoned me.
They are trying
to assassinate me.
- Nicholas.
- Okay.
I just have to examine
your stomach.
Obote's people are everywhere.
They want me dead, Nicholas.
Okay, I'm just-
I need to do this. Okay?
One more. One more.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Okay. I think I know what this is.
Let me listen, just listen.
Okay. Yeah, okay.
I think I know what this is.
Bear with me. Uh-
There we go.
There we are.
Okay.
I'm gonna ask you
to sit on this pouf right here.
- Hey! What is this?
- It's okay. It's okay.
- What is this?
- It's okay. I'm just gonna hold it against your stomach.
I'm gonna ask you to stand up...
in three.
One, two, three. Go.
I feel better,
much better.
Ah. Ah, yes.
You are a good doctor.
Thank you.
In future, remember
not to mix beer with aspirin.
- That was the cause?
- I think so, yes.
I am ashamed
that you saw me like that.
- I was frightened.
- I'm a doctor.
Everything that passes between us
is confidential.
Okay? I've taken an oath.
But a man who shows fear,
he is weak...
and he is a slave.
Well, if you're afraid
of dying...
it shows you have
a life worth keeping.
Ah.
You see?
You are a doctor...
and also a philosopher.
Yes.
I do have
a good life now.
Please.
Please, sit.
Sit here.
Sit here.
I come from...
a very poor family.
I think
you should know this.
My father, he left me
when I was a child.
The British army,
it became my home.
They took me as a...
cleaner in the kitchen,
cleaning pots.
They used to beat me.
"Build this wall, Amin. "
"Dig this latrine, Amin. "
And now here I am,
the president of Uganda.
And who put me here?
Huh?
It was the British.
What a story.
- Good night, Nicholas.
- Good night, sir.
Uh, hello. Sarah, it's Nicholas.
- Nicholas, where are you?
- I'm still in Kampala actually.
Thank you.
Look, the president's
offered me a job here.
Normally, I wouldn't even
bother considering it.
- But, under the circumstances...
- Thank you.
I thought it might
be quite a good idea.
Oh, I see.
David will be disappointed.
Oh, well, I'll write to David.
Of course I will.
Of course.
I just hope you can do as much good there
as you could've done here.
Look, somebody's
callin' me.
I'd, uh, better go.
- Sure.
- All right. Well, listen. Bye, Sarah.
- I'll be in touch.
- Bye.
When you're not treating
the president or his family...
the hospital could use
your expertise here.
This is one
of our new medical wards.
Farther down the corridor
will be the operating theaters...
which the president
has paid for himself.
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Doctor.
- Welcome to Mulago, Dr. -
- Garrigan. Hello.
I do hope you find the hospital
up to the standard you are used to.
Uh, excuse me.
Who was that?
Your predecessor-
Dr. Junju.
- Never mind him.
- Excuse me, sir. Two men to see you.
- Excuse me a moment.
- Of course.
- Hello. Jolly nice of you.
- It's very nice.
Dr. Garrigan.
Just topping up on quinine.
So, you've decided to stay.
- Uh, yes. Yes, I did.
- Excellent. Excellent.
Well, listen,
I just wanted to say...
that if there's anything
we can possibly help you with...
please don't, um,
hesitate.
What, you're my new best friend now?
Do just stay in touch.
Why?
Well, given
that we were so, uh...
intimately involved
with the president coming to... power...
the Foreign Office has asked me
to point out our awareness...
of your very unique personal relationship
with President Amin.
Mm-hmm?
Should you find the need to clarify your status...
regarding the details
of that relationship...
we would of course welcome
any clarification you might...
feel the need to share with us.
Is there some special school
where you people...
learn to talk
that bollocks?
Do, please, stay in touch.
You-You take care now.
This man is going to kill-
He's going to kill the president.
So Nicholas walks up to that cow,
and he shoots it in the head.
On your marks!
Get set!
Go!
Amin! Amin!
- Ho!
- I won.
Hit my hand. Yes.
- Okay. Nicholas.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Before I forget,
I need to ask a favor.
Anything.
I will be in Libya
next week...
and I need you to attend
a meeting in my place.
- What kind of meeting?
- A simple matter of taste and common sense.
I cannot think of anyone
better than you.
Ah, gentlemen, please.
Don't get up.
The president
sends his apologies.
He's been called away-
on short notice.
He's asked me to step in.
- And you are?
- Nicholas Garrigan, his doctor.
- His doctor?
- Yes.
- And you are?
- I'm the Austrian foreign minister.
This is Dr. Ramml,
one of our leading architects...
and Dr. Brunner
from the Institute of Civil Engineering.
Together,
we are the first bid.
Bid, right.
For what precisely?
I love it.
Good choice.
Modern, elegant-
a symbol of Uganda's future.
- Here is where we will have the
next Pan-African Congress. - Nice.
My two closest advisors-
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
- Look what Nicholas has designed for me.
- Nice.
- I didn't design anything. It was more-
- That's nonsense.
You have a wonderful eye.
Jonah- he has...
no taste.
Look at him.
Even his suits,
they look silly.
Is that not right, Jonah?
What is it you want, Jonah?
I have some ministerial papers
for your signature.
Go.
I will sign them later.
I do not like the way
that man looks at me.
Do you think
he looks at me strangely?
No. No, I can't say
that I've noticed.
Okay. Enlargement
of the medial sternum...
and reticular nodular
lung patterns-
all indicating
pulmonary T.B.
Yeah, but it could be disseminated-
What was that?
Makindye Prison-
where Obote's people are being held.
Can you hear that?
Dr. Garrigan! Dr. Garrigan!
Please! Come quickly.
The president's son
is sick.
What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him?
Can you hear me, child?
I'm begging you to stop it. Mackenzie!
- Thank you. You can step away.
- Stop it, Mackenzie. Please.
- Thank you. Your son's epileptic?
- I don't know.
- What? Has he been like this before?
- Yes.
Right. Can you hold his knees
up against his chest?
- Yeah, yeah.
- If you can do that. Okay. The other hand back here.
- This is Campbell?
- It's Mackenzie, Campbell's brother.
- Mackenzie? Right.
- Come on, Mackenzie. Come on, baby.
Mackenzie,
I am Dr. Garrigan. Okay?
We're gonna
sort you out.
- We'll get you to hospital. It's gonna be fine.
- No, no, no.
- The president will not allow it.
- I really think the child-
- You must do what you can do from here.
- The child has to go to hospital.
Please! Please.
It's okay now, baby.
Mama's here.
Mama is here.
It's okay. Mama's here.
Okay. Okay.
There you are. Okay.
Okay.
- There we are.
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.
- I thought I was losing him.
- It's okay. He's gonna be fine.
Could you, uh- Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?
Could you move the toys
from that bed, please?
Ah.
Big boy.
Big boy.
Here we go.
It's okay, baby.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Don't say sorry.
Don't say sorry.
- This is where you live?
- Yes.
Why not at State House
with the other wives?
Since I had Mackenzie, my husband prefers us
to be somewhere more private.
That's ridiculous.
I think this child
has epilepsy.
It's a perfectly treatable
condition.
- The president does visit you here?
- He visits the children, not me.
I am a bad omen.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna make an appointment
for Mackenzie at the hospital.
All right?
I will tell the president
how helpful you have been.
Very nice.
Good morning, Nicholas.
I could not go without thanking you
for helping my son-
Don't mention it.
and to bring you
a small gift.
No doctor should be
without his ambulance.
For me?
Yes. Come. Come.
This is yours here.
Oh.
Uh-huh?
What do you think?
Are you serious?
It-It's a fantastic gift.
Are you happy now? Eh?
Let's try it.
You can drive me to the airport.
I have to fly to Libya on business.
- Don't you think that I should get dressed?
- Quickly then. Quickly.
- Now? Right.
- Yes.
I'll just be a minute.
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yeah, very much. Thank you.
Ah.
So, uh, it- it was Obote's men
who attacked the prison, yeah?
- Yes.
- Right.
We heard the gunfire
all the way at the hospital.
- Yes, and my soldiers, they held them off.
- Oh, right.
We thought we were going
to be inundated with casualties.
Do you want to drive your car?
I want to see you drive your car.
- Okay.
- Please. Come.
- Come.
- Okay. Okay.
So, you do not like the way
I treat my son.
Uh, no.
No, I don't.
Hiding him away like that,
it's-it's ruining his life.
That boy
has everything he wants.
Except the treatment
that could save him.
He has comfort
and luxury in life.
- Money? Sir, it's no substitute for anything.
- Nicholas.
You have never been poor.
What about Kay?
Don't you think it's, uh-
Do not speak about things
you do not understand.
But the way
you are concerned...
it has touched me,
and I will consider.
You know, I like this type
of frank conversation.
Yes. I respect
your honesty...
and your opinion
completely.
- Nicholas!
- Stop!
- Shit! Shit!
- Drive! Drive.
Drive past! Drive!
Drive!
Obote's men!
I'm sure of it!
If I had not been
in your car-
But... it is in my dream.
They cannot kill me. It is in my dream.
Somebody told his men
my travel plans.
Somebody is betraying me.
I cannot trust... anybody.
I'm surrounded...
by traitors!
Masanga.
Nicholas.
Nicholas.
You know Masanga?
He is one of my people.
He will handle all
of my security matters from now on.
Yes, sir.
- You will take care of me and this country.
- Yes, sir.
Where is Jonah Wasswa?
Where is he?
I need my minister.
A minister should be
by his president's side.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
And you call yourself
my closest advisor?
Huh?
You see?
You see?
These loyal soldiers...
already they have
captured the criminals.
Do not pity them,
Nicholas.
These men here,
they wanted you dead.
Why did you try to kill me?
Huh?
I will not die...
until I say!
Look at me!
Obote!
Huh?
You work for him!
Obote! Huh?
That-That...
drunk, silly man!
You want to kill me
for that drunk, silly man?
Huh?
Uganda loves me...
because I am loyal...
and I am fair.
I am your president.
Come, Nicholas.
This is no place for us.
These I can read you later.
And the rest-The rest
are just pro forma papers for you to sign.
Um, I left a small list
of medical equipment at the end...
for my old surgery
in Mgambo.
Is there anything else,
Nicholas?
Eh?
Nicholas?
It's probably nothing, sir.
What?
Nicholas, you are
my closest advisor.
Please.
Tell me
what is on your mind.
Last night, I went to the Holiday Inn
and had a drink.
I saw Jonah Wasswa there
speaking to some white guy in the bar.
Something about it
just didn't seem right.
It's- It's probably nothing...
but, uh, you might wanna
have a talk with him.
Just- Just a talk.
Like I say,
Good night, sir.
- Ah. How are you?
- Very well. How are you?
Very well.
See you next week.
Would you care for a drink?
That's very good, Mackenzie.
Very good.
Go show your brother.
Hiya.
Hiya.
Uh, he's looking
much better.
Much better.
That other one is Campbell.
He is the one
who got your T-shirt.
You're a man of taste.
Mummy! Mummy!
Please, goodbye.
- Mummy! He keeps pushing me! Mummy!
- Okay, stop it.
Stop it, Mackenzie.
Dr. Garrigan. Daydreaming?
Well, looking at you, Stone,
I certainly hope so.
I wasn't expecting to find you here.
I thought you'd be with the president
on his trip to London.
No, I'm needed here.
- I do hope the man hasn't blown up again.
- Uh, what?
I was reading this article in the Times.
I don't know if you've seen it.
It seems a high court judge who recently
ruled against Amin has gone missing.
- Hasn't been seen for five days.
- I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.
Well, the thing is,
we've been getting reports...
up and down the country
of the same thing.
People speaking out
against the regime...
just, uh, disappearing.
No. Look, if you're gonna accuse the president
of something, you just come out and say it.
- All right?
- I was just hoping you might be able...
to give us a little
clarification.
Oh, fuck your clarifications,
Stone! Fuck them.
You people amaze me.
You know, the first sign of an independent
African leader actually achieving something...
and what do you do?
You spit your dummy because you can't stand
the idea that he's done it without you.
I know he's maybe a little bit rough,
but what do you expect?
Do you think Obote's people
are sittin' around waitin' for clarifications?
Look at me.
This is Africa.
You meet violence with violence.
Anything else,
and you're dead.
Well, then perhaps
you'd be so kind...
as to explain to me the whereabouts
of Health Minister Wasswa.
What?
Well, he's, uh-
he's missing too.
But, as you say,
I'm sure there's some, uh...
perfectly normal
explanation.
I'm, uh, having drinks later...
with the man
who wrote the article.
Perhaps you'd like
to join us...
and shed some light
on the matter.
- Fine. I will.
- All right. Six o'clockish.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm here to see the health minister.
I'm afraid she's busy.
You were right.
The health minister has gone missing.
Apparently, he's fled to Tanzania.
What? Jonah Wasswa?
Mmm.
It appears he's embezzled several hundred
thousand pounds' worth of Ministry funds.
And some people are suggesting
that he's joined up with Obote's exiles.
- I find that very hard to believe.
- The man was on the verge...
of sealing a major
pharmaceutical deal.
Life-saving penicillin for the masses.
I should know. I set up the meeting
with his South African counterpart...
at, um, the Holiday Inn.
So, this embezzlement-
is it on the record?
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- And I can quote you in the paper?
- I'm sorry? Quote me?
- Not directly, of course.
As a government spokesman.
Government spokesman?
Aye.
Mr. President.
I've come to say good-bye.
I'm going home.
Mr. President?
Boo!
I got you.
I got him.
Nicholas, meet my
body double, Wzenga.
Look at him.
Everything the same.
Except-
What do you say, Nicholas?
Is he as handsome as me?
- No. No, he's not.
- Aha! You see?
You see? Nicholas agrees.
You are much more ugly than me, Wzenga.
Look, look, look, Nicholas.
I have others also.
All part of Captain Masanga's plan
for my security.
Clever, huh?
Yeah.
Nicholas.
My Nicholas.
What is all this
about your going home?
Hmm?
We-
You once told me
that you respected me...
'cause I wasn't afraid
to speak my mind.
Mmm. Speak.
It's this business with Wasswa.
I can't-
It fucking stinks. And I can't help coming
back to that moment...
when I asked you
to talk to him.
Look, this isn't me.
I have to go home now.
You cannot.
What?
Your work is not
finished here yet.
But I didn't come here
to finish anything.
You promised to me...
that you would help
to build a new Uganda.
You swore an oath.
The oath is, um-
It's- It's a doctor's oath of confidentiality.
We all take it.
- It's got nothing to do with Uganda.
- Huh?
Nothing?
Nothing comes from nothing.
You have a conscience.
I know you do.
That is why you came here
in the first place.
Or are you like
all the other British?
Just here to fuck
and to take away.
No.
- No.
- No.
Why else would I trust you
with my family?
You are like my own son.
I'm Nicholas Garrigan...
and I'm from Scotland.
That's my home.
I want to go-
Your home is here.
Please.
Just, please-
Do not be a silly boy.
If you go now, what will they think about you
and, uh, Jonah Wasswa?
What are you talkin' about?
I said- I said talk to him.
Do not pretend to yourself
that you did not know.
You are a stronger man
than that.
I didn't want him
to die though.
But you-you did it.
- Why? You want to know why?
- Mm-hmm.
You did it because...
you love me.
You have stepped deep
into the heart of my country.
Uganda.
Uganda embraces you.
Nicholas.
Nicholas.
What you need
is to have some fun.
Hey, Nicholas.
Where have you been?
- I want you to meet Betty.
- Betty.
And this here is her sister Joy.
- Joy.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Joy is going to look after you this weekend.
Joy-
- All right.
- All right.
And now, let the games begin.
Yes.
Nicholas. You did not know we had
Ugandan cowboys, eh?
Finance Minister.
Come here.
All right.
Can I have another whiskey,
please?
Well, let me tell you, Nicholas,
you've chosen a fine life.
You want to kill me for that drunk, silly man?
Nicholas. Nicholas.
Dr. Garrigan.
Jesus fucking Christ,
you look so lovely.
You know something?
I shouldn't be here.
I should be in Scotland
with my dad.
I should be looking after little old ladies,
'cause- 'cause here I've fucked up.
Kay, I fucked up.
I fucked up.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Not here.
- Walk with me.
- What?
Walk with me.
- I'm fucking doomed.
- Watch your head.
You know he's got
go-go dancers after me now?
Where are we going?
I don't know.
Nicky?
Oh, shit!
It's the go-go dancer.
- Oh, uh- uh-
- Nicky?
In here.
In here. Come on.
Just follow me.
Up here.
Shh! Shh!
You be quiet.
Shh!
Oh, fuck it.
He has always
been like this.
He just chose not
to show you until now.
Nicholas.
You have to find
a way to get out.
He still listens to me.
He cannot trust
anybody anymore.
I'll wait
till things get really bad.
They are... really bad.
Huh?
What?
- Nothing.
- What?
I just had this mad image
of me and you sittin'...
at my mother and father's
dinner table.
Oh.
"More stew, Mrs. Amin?"
Nicholas.
You've got to get out.
To the lake!
Everybody to the lake! President's order!
Everybody to the lake!
To the lake!
- What is going on?
- President's order!
- I don't know.
- What if somebody saw us?
Okay. You just wait two minutes
and then come out after me, all right?
Yeah.
Go, go, go, go.
Shit.
Dr. Garrigan.
It's 4:00
in the morning.
Can I have a word with you?
- Whiskey?
- Okay.
They've, uh-
They've taken my passport.
You were saying that
if there was ever anything you could do-
I need to get out of here
while I still can.
I was hoping you might
be able to help in that.
- Please.
- "Please. " It's a nice touch.
Mmm.
Have you any idea what's
going on in this country, Dr. Garrigan?
Some.
In the countryside, they're not even
bothering to dig graves anymore.
They're simply feeding them
to the crocodiles.
Right here in Kampala,
right under our noses...
he's wiped out the entire
political opposition.
Thousands of Acholi...
and Langi tribesmen
from the army.
He's hardly even bothering
to cover it up anymore.
Even members of his own cabinet.
Your friend
the health minister.
This man is actually
trying to help his country.
Idi always seems
to get it wrong, doesn't he?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Get me out of here.
You earn
your passage first.
Wha-What?
You know what
they're calling you?
His white monkey.
I'm his doctor.
It's not my job
to judge the man.
"I'm his doctor. "
Is that your defense? How pathetic.
Fuck off, Garrigan.
We don't just hand out passports
to chimps like you.
Particularly not chimps
with blood on their hands.
Look, you, I'm a citizen,
and I have rights.
Fuck your rights. You do as I say,
or you don't get out of here.
You're his doctor.
You have unprecedented access to him.
Obviously,
we'd help you with...
anything you needed.
You want me to kill him?
Amidst persistent rumors...
of human rights violations
and economic mismanagement...
the situation in Uganda
has deteriorated badly in recent months.
The opening of
10 new hospitals has had to be deferred...
and all the rest of them-
But getting any definite
information on the country...
has become harder and harder.
President Amin has accused...
the British government of attempting
to assassinate him and undermining him-
And so his policies
are growing ever more unpredictable.
The British government
has broken its promises to Uganda.
Because of this,
I have decided to expel...
all Asians from this country.
And these people,
they are leeches.
They milk the cow...
but they do not want
to feed the cow.
No longer.
They have 90 days to leave.
They are too sick to leave.
Take your hands off him!
This is a sick man. How dare you!
I don't care where
you get your orders from!
You cannot come into a hospital
and start shoving people!
They are forcing us
to leave!
Whoa!
This is a hospital!
You get your men
out of here now!
I'm complaining personally
to the president.
You all right?
I'll see to this.
You're trying to help your people.
I understand that.
But Uganda isn't ready, sir.
You expel the Asians now,
this economy will be on its knees.
Not to mention the damage you'll do
to your reputation abroad.
Is that what
you came here for?
To plead...
for your fucking
Asian tailor?
These things
do not concern you.
You are nothing
but a doctor.
You are a nobody.
Get out.
Get out!
Sarah!
Sarah!
- Hello?
- Oh, I can't believe-
What have we done?
Who?
Kay, is that you?
He is going to kill us,
Nicholas.
He's going to kill us.
I have to get it out of me.
He will kill me, Nicholas.
I have to get it out.
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.
I want you to do it.
Please. You're a doctor.
I know you can do it.
- I know you can do it, Nicholas.
- No, we can't!
I can't do that!
This isn't some
simple procedure.
It has to be done under clinical conditions.
I have to- If you don't do something now,
I'm going to have to find a place to go.
I'm- I'm going to have to get it done
in one of the villages. Is that what you want?
No. No, you don't.
Come here. Whatever you do,
you don't do that.
All right?
I'm gonna sort
something out. Just...
promise me you'll
stay in the house.
Please promise me
you'll stay in the house.
P- Promise me this-
Promise me this is
going to be all right.
I promise.
We'll do it first thing
in the morning.
- Kay Amin?
- Mm-hmm.
- The president's wife?
- Yes.
No. No, no, no.
- We couldn't do that here. Not at Mulago.
- Why not?
It's the president's hospital!
He's bound to find out.
- We could do this discretely, Tommy.
- No!
He would kill her and us.
It's too much to risk.
What other choice
does she have?
Some-Some backstreet job
in a village somewhere?
Come on, Thomas.
You know what that means.
It's the only choice
you've left her.
But I don't expect it crossed
your mind to wonder, huh?
A white man
with a black woman.
What does she need
with such things?
Fine.
I'll do it myself.
The president
wants to see you now.
My head is exploding!
I- I can't think!
I can't sleep!
Look at this!
Look at this!
The British newspapers
say I am a madman.
The American newspapers
say I am a cannibal.
I am a cannibal, huh?
Huh?
These are lies!
I should throw them out
for good.
Only Ugandan press
from now on.
- Do you want something for the headache, sir?
- No.
- Something to help you sleep perhaps?
- Later.
I want you to tell me
what to do.
You want me to tell you
what to do?
Yes. You are my advisor.
You are the only one
I can trust in here.
You should have told me not to throw
the Asians out in the first place.
I did.
But you did not
persuade me, Nicholas.
You did not persuade me.
Huh?
Tell me what to do here.
Don't throw
the journalists out.
They're only gonna write
more lies about you.
Invite them to meet you
face-to-face.
You charm them.
You show them
what kind of a man you are.
Hmm.
You think this will work?
I think that's the Amin
they need to see.
Thank you.
Thank you very much,
Nicholas.
What would I do
without my Nicholas, huh?
What would I do
without my Nicholas?
Is there something
going on here?
- Huh?
- No.
No.
- No.
- Is there?
- No.
- Huh?
- No.
- Are you sure, Nicholas?
Yes.
Yes.
Give me a booster.
Something to make me
feel strong again.
- Sir.
- Where are you going, Nicholas?
I have, uh, something
that I have to attend to.
Uh-uh.
No.
You have to stay here.
I need you for
the press conference.
This is all very well, Your Excellency,
but what about the reports of mass killings?
Who have you been talking with?
The British?
Go. Look around Uganda
for missing people.
Go anywhere you please.
So why would the British spread these rumors?
Yeah?
Because... they hate me...
because I refuse
to recognize South Africa-
a racist regime
that they support.
Also, they are
jealous of me.
Why?
Because while they are starving
with their strikes and with their protests...
the people of Uganda are eating
beef and driving big cars.
I have-
I have created
the Save Britain Fund.
We Ugandans, we like to help our friends.
So, the Ugandans have got together...
and saved three tons
of food and vegetables...
for their friends in England.
Because they are having economic difficulties,
let me assure you here.
Kay?
It's Nick.
Kay, it's okay. It's Nick.
- What?
- She went to the village.
We had to take her
to hospital.
It's been reported that you've
crowned yourself the last king of Scotland.
Yes. My good friends,
the Scottish people...
have seen how I have
defeated the English here...
and they want me to do
the same for them there.
Yeah, her.
This woman here.
Did you "wrote" the queen of England,
offering yourself as a lover?
You- You- You are- You are very cheeky.
And this is what happens
when you betray the president.
This is what happens
when you betray him.
I'm not turned off to sex.
I enjoy it.
I could spend the rest of my life getting laid.
There should be more to it
than a lot of little tingles.
They say she has a clitoris
halfway down her throat.
Is this possible...
medically?
Oh, yeah.
Almost all aberrations of nature
are possible.
I made an example of her...
because she betrayed me.
I brought you those headache
pills that you asked for.
Good.
Is there anything else?
No. No, that's all.
Then go.
We are busy here.
Uh-huh.
Allô?
Good morning.
Come on.
- Shit.
- Hello?
- Yes?
- Come on.
Yes, sir.
Nicholas,
there you are!
- Were you trying to run away from me?
- No. No.
- Huh?
- No.
I need you at the airport
right away...
- to help me with the hostages.
- H-Hostages?
Yes. An Air France aeroplane has been hijacked
by our Palestinian brothers.
They have landed here
at Entebbe.
The eyes of the world
are on Uganda today.
Come, Nicholas.
To work.
How many passengers?
250?
And how many of them
are Zionist?
And, uh, television?
Plenty of
television cameras?
Mmm. Yes. Tell them to take the hostages
to the terminal building.
- Mr. President, the press is waiting for you, sir.
- All right.
I wanted to assure you that the hostages
will get the best medical care.
I have made
my own doctor available.
Doctor? Doctor,
what's the situation here?
We've one woman
with a heart condition.
She's already gone to hospital.
A few cases of shock.
And we're giving malaria pills
to everyone.
- Okay, who's not been seen by a doctor yet?
- I haven't.
- We haven't.
- How many of you are there?
- I haven't, please.
- You neither?
- You've not been seen yet?
- Malaria pills. How is everybody doing?
Thank you very much.
Okay. Um, okay. Anybody else?
Okay. Take these three.
The nurse is gonna
come round with water. Nurse?
Thomas? Thomas, can you
take these, please?
- All right.
- Just be two minutes.
Just take one.
Malaria pills. Thank you.
Stop! Don't!
Spit.
Look at you.
Is there one thing
you have done that is good?
Did you think
this was all a game?
"I will go to Africa...
and I will play the white man
with the natives. "
Is that what you thought?
We are not a game, Nicholas.
We are real.
This room here-
it is real.
I think your death...
will be the first
real thing...
that has happened to you.
Listen to me, Nicholas.
Listen.
I know.
Yes.
I know about you and Kay.
How could you do that to me?
I am the father
of this nation, Nicholas.
And you have most grossly...
offended your father.
You're a child.
That's what makes you
so fucking scary.
In my village...
when you steal...
the wife of an elder...
they take you to a tree...
and they hang you
by your skin.
Each time you scream...
the evil comes out of you.
Sometimes it can take
three days...
for your evil to be spent.
Pull him up.
Good evening.
I have good news.
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.
So, as a gesture
of good faith...
all non-Israeli hostages
will be released.
I have arranged,
personally...
an aeroplane to come
and collect you.
Yes, yes.
He'll be here
when we come back.
This way, Israelis!
Israelis stay here.
They have sent a plane.
They are releasing
some of the hostages.
If you go now, you will
reach them before they leave.
Here. Put this on.
Why-Why are you
doing this?
Frankly...
I don't know.
You deserve to die.
But dead,
you can do nothing.
Alive...
you might just be able
to redeem yourself.
I don't understand.
I am tired of hatred,
Dr. Garrigan.
This country
is drowning in it.
We deserve better.
Go home. Tell the world
the truth about Amin.
They will believe you.
You are a white man.
What about you?
My fate is in God's hands.
Go. Now. Before they come back.
Thank you.
Go. Go.
I said stop!
Where is the doctor?
I don't know.
Destination Paris.
My wife-
Because many of the people who,
uh, broke relations with Israel...
they are not only Muslims,
they are also Christians.
This particular certain point
is very important-
