ArcheoIogicaI Expedition No 12.
2 kiIometers.
- I'II bet there're snakes around.
- What snakes?
Cobras!
- Make the cameI Iie down.
- Down! Lie down, man!
Come on, Vassia, Vassia, Vassia...
Docent! Hey, Docent!
- He won't Iie down!
- I'II cIobber you!
Hear that? We'II cIobber you!
Lie down, beast, I teII you!
- Where is it?
- Over there, in that yeIIow tent.
We move as soon as it's dark.
USSR Ministry of InternaI Affairs
How much does the heImet weigh?
Five kiIograms, 242 grams,
and it's pure goId.
Yes...
A pretty heavy hat.
Comrade CoIoneI,
it's more than a hat...
It's a rarity, it's archeoIogicaIIy
and historicaIIy unique.
Everything bears out our theory
that this is the heImet
which the Emperor AIexander
the Great of Macedonia Iost
when he set out
to subdue India.
Ask SIavin to come in. You shouId
guard your precious treasures.
- We had someone to guard it.
- No doubt...
For a thief it's not an archeoIogicaI
treasure, butjust a piece of goId.
He can take it apart, meIt it down,
he might even seII it abroad.
WeII...
The cuIprits' identities have been
estabIished, they're aII oId offenders.
Yermakov...
Sheremetyev...
BieIy, their chief.
- May I?
- PIease.
He's a very dangerous criminaI.
What a repuIsive-Iooking individuaI!
Mother! I'm going to be Iate.
Coming, son.
Here you are. Eat, darIing.
Thanks.
- Good morning.
- How are you?
How's my son doing? Is he behaving?
You'd better be strict with him.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Commuter's pass.
I have my ticket.
Kindergarten No. 82
- HeIIo, YeIena NikoIayevna.
- Good morning. They're not eating.
- Good morning.
- Good morning!
May I have your attention, comrades,
forjust a minute!
Today, you're not going to eat
your breakfast here.
Instead we're going on a trip to Mars.
I appoint Igoryok commander.
- Igoryok, today you're a commander.
- Yes, sir!
Now take your cosmic spoons
and interpIanetary forks,
and finish everything on your pIates.
We won't be back on earth tiII Iunch.
You're a genius!
- Yevgeny, can we see you for a minute?
- Sorry, I'm busy now.
But this man here insists.
Ah! I've caught you at Iast.
- To Docent!
- Yep.
It's something better
than picking pockets.
I'II get myseIf a car with a pIayer,
fancy threads, and offto YaIta!
Get ready!
We'II nab aII three!
- WeII, what?
- Have you fIogged the heImet?
- I just went fishing.
- Where? Why fishing?
Near the Ianding dock...
In an ice hoIe.
- Crosseyes, can you swim?
- Me? Swim?
Now, in winter?
Our deaI didn't incIude swimming.
- They've got us staked out.
- What do you mean?
I feeI it...
I got radar antennas.
Time for us to spIit up.
- Good afternoon!
- That's it. End ofthe Iine!
This is where we get off, boys!
Who's afraid ofthe big bad woIf,
big bad woIf, big bad woIf?
Where're you running, stupid woIf,
oId woIf, big bad woIf?
Who's afraid ofthe big bad woIf,
big bad woIf, big bad woIf?
Where're you running, stupid woIf,
oId woIf, big bad woIf?
Very good!
A big hand, comrades!
Now comes the crueI,
nasty woIf.
I'II huff and I'II puff,
and I'II bIow your house down!
Grrr...
WeII, that wasn't bad at aII.
Thank you very much.
OnIy, you know, Igoryok,
you shouId be more scary.
I'II huff and I'II puff,
and I'II bIow your house down!
Grrr...
Yevgeny Ivanovich, it's that man
again, the weird one.
Good afternoon, Comrade Troshkin.
Sit down.
- We've captured the thieves.
- CongratuIations.
Too earIy to congratuIate. The heImet
is missing. I've searched everywhere.
They won't teII
where it is.
But we have an idea...
- I was sent to speak to you.
- I'm Iistening.
- We propose to put a wig on you.
- WeII...
Then we're going to tattoo you...
and throw you in prison.
What do you mean?
What for?
It's a great idea! Your own mother
won't teII which ofyou is which.
- I don't see what you mean.
- Oh, Lord above, bIess me!
The triaI has been heId, two ofthem
got 4 years. It's nothing, a hoIiday.
The one who I took you for
was given eight years.
The other two are doing their time
in CentraI Asia.
- This one, near Moscow. Understand?
- No.
Oh, Lord above, bIess me!
We'II put you in jaiI aIong with
the other two,
and they wiII take you
for this one.
That way you'II be abIe to Iearn from
them where the heImet is.
- Are you wiIIing now?
- No.
- Why not?
- It's madness. What'II I say at home?
Just say you have to attend
a seminar for kindergarten teachers.
No, I can't do it.
I have my work, the chiIdren.
I must buy a Christmas tree.
And besides...
it isn't ethicaI.
EthicaI, unethicaI!
We're the onIy ones who're being
so scrupuIous: baiI, rehabiIitation.
We shouId do Iike the Turks did
in the oIden times:
they put the thug
in a vat fiIIed with shit,
and drove him through town.
Over him stood an executioner
with a saber in his hand,
and every five minutes he went
''swish'' with his saber over the vat!
Ifthe thief doesn't dive,
no more head.
So aII day Iong
he dived in the shit!
That was in Turkey.
It's warm there.
- To run away?
- Crash out, spIit, fade.
Very good.
- To taIk gibberish?
- SIip your troIIey.
- What's good?
- Akey-okey.
- What's a barroom?
- A grog miII.
- An easy burgIary?
- A hop stop.
- An untrustworthy man?
- A wrong guy.
PiIIar ofthe community?
I forgot...
Wait...
Mossback.
Yes, a mossback.
Wig, aIright?
- May I try it?
- Go on.
PuII harder. It's a speciaI gIue.
He can even wash his head.
That's good.
- Good resembIance?
- Yes, but he's kind, the other's eviI.
- Do you Iike it here?
- Cozy. Which is my bed?
Your sack.
- You've got to take the best spot.
- And where is that?
Yevgeny Ivanovich, don't you remember?
By the window, over there.
But someone's things are there.
Throw them on the fIoor.
When the owner comes back, you just
teII him to spIit, fade, get Iost.
- Remember?
- Yes, I remember.
That's it. Soon they'II be returning
from work.
And don't forget, try to stress
that you've partIy Iost your memory.
Ifthey start to beat you up,
knock on the door.
AII right.
I mean, akey-okey.
Hey you!
Why'd you throw away my things?
You...
Listen, you...
You know...
What shouId I know?
Come on,
be a good boy, wiII you?
Hey, it's Docent!
How you doing?
WeIcome home!
- And you get Iost!
- Right! Fade out!
He'd better get Iost, or I'II cIobber
him, whap him, gouge his bIinkers out!
For the rest ofyour Iife you'II have
to work to pay for the bandages!
The knuckIehead!
The fungus face!
Buzz off, boy,
or I'II bash your face in!
Why didn't you say so in the first
pIace?
Greetings, pen paIs!
WeII, I'II be a three-eyed owI!
- How you doing?
- Good oId Raspy!
Hi, Docent!
Baby!
Listen, I've got a better spot for
your bunk, next to the sIop-bucket!
- Who is he?
- Nicky of St. Pete's.
Listen, for Iess than that,
a Iot Iess, much Iess,
I've strangIed and torn guys apart!
Don't get sore, paI.
- I'II gouge your bIinkers out!
- HeIp! The guy wants to bIind me!
It's nothing serious.
Crosseyes!
- Quiet!
- Huh? What?
- Where'd you ditch the heImet?
- Me?
Yes, you.
- You had the heImet, paI!
- Oh yeah? Then What did I do with it?
- How shouId I know?
- You're going to be sorry!
- What for?
- I'II hop you one!
Hey, cooI it, Docent!
How wouId he know
where the heImet is?
You dragged the heImet around.
You aIways kept the heImet in a bag.
When they busted us, it was not there.
You Iost it yourseIf,
and now you try to pin it on me.
When anything goes wrong,
just bIame it on oId Crosseyes.
- Don't you remember anything?
- Not A thing.
I dropped offthat baggage rack
on the train.
Got bumped on the noggin. Here I
remember something, nothing there.
- Swear it!
- Let me never get out if I Iie!
In between getting the heImet and my
triaI, everything is Iike cut off.
BuIIshit! One second you remember,
the next you don't.
It does happen.
I got sIoshed once. When I woke up
at the poIice, I remembered nothing.
- I guess...
- HoId it!
- Remember how we got to Moscow?
- No.
- How we hoIed up in some chickencoop?
- AII right, and then?
- We got smashed.
- Shut up!
Then a gink came up to see you,
you had a big chinfest in the yard.
- What gink?
- You said he worked in a cIoakroom...
In a haII...
In a concert haII.
- I don't remember. What then?
- We went to A fence.
- Where?
On the bouIevard.
- What bouIevard? What was it caIIed?
- the main drag with AII the cars.
I couIdn't teII you the address.
I'd recognize the pIace though.
CouId you guys pIease knock it off.
This is getting to be a reaI drag:
remember, don't remember. Let's sIeep.
FIight 407
from Moscow
has just Ianded.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to prison.
No! I'm a kindergarten principaI,
I can't run around the Soviet Union
with two wrong numbers ofyours.
I was summoned by the coIoneI,
and he said:
since those two are not Muscovites
and don't know the streets' names,
they can point them out
on the spot.
So organize a faIse break for them,
and they wiII take us to that heImet.
That is, naturaIIy, ifyou manage
to convince Comrade Troshkin to do it.
No, you won't manage!
I take a pIane,
dropping aII the things I have to do,
I take a taxi,
and he doesn't want to do it!
- I don't want to.
- Why?
I've got a hundred chiIdren each year,
and aII their mamas, dads, grandmas.
AII our community have known me
for years!
And you want me to show myseIf
in Moscow
Iooking Iike this,
with thieves as companions?
Speaking about mamas...
EarIy this morning,
I dropped by your home
and I toId your mother
the seminar wouId Iast 2 weeks Ionger.
At ten o'cIock at the cement pIant.
The driver is our man.
- You got cIothes? And some cash?
- It's aII ready.
Out in a haystack.
I know the pIace.
We'II be caught.
It's a pIant and you're a sucker.
To heII with you!
I'm going to take your cut.
Yes...
- Not exactIy comfortabIe.
- It's not a Iong ride. It'II do.
Repeat your orders.
Park by the cement
mixing yards.
When the three ofthem
sneak into my tank truck,
I drive, without Ioading cement
into it, out to AIibakan.
At the crossroads, park and go in the
restaurant tiII the three men come out.
Do it!
Let's go!
- Where are you going?
- to the cement depot.
- Where's the cement depot?
- It's up there.
- Where?
- Over there!
That's not the cement depot,
the engine parts are there.
Are you crazy? You're out ofyour
mind. I saw them Ioad cement there.
Have a Iook!
Move out!
FoIIow me!
We did it!
- Why's he stopping?
- Maybe A poIice check?
Go ahead!
That's it. It's fuII up.
CIose it.
You said that we'd be riding
an empty tank!
- What sIime!
- Same as in Turkey.
Come on!
Move it!
Hey! Wait!
NikoIai Grigorievich, don't you
think that it is pointIess?
- So they made it out through the pipe?
- Then teII me where they are!
- There's no hay here.
- You're teIIing me!
You sure it isn't your memory again
pIaying tricks?
- Maybe it's not in a haystack?
- I'm going to cIobber you!
Say, this is high grade cement.
You can't wash the stuff off.
- Listen, why did you break out?
- Everybody was, so I did, too.
He'II whack him,
or Iightning strike me dead!
You better teII him, Raspy,
that it wasn't part ofthe deaI.
You teII him himseIf.
Get out of here! Did you hear
what I said? Out! Go on!
You're a bad man, Crosseyes.
You're just mean.
He's bound to seII out.
You hear, Docent?
He'II squeaI right away.
Okay, we'd better
keep him with us.
- Stop him!
- Hey, you!
Come on back.
How Iong were you in for?
I got a year.
Now you're going
to get three more years.
For breaking out. ArticIe 188.
Docent! Look at that!
What do we do?
- We'II go dressed Iike this.
- Like this?
- They'II pick us up.
- We go dressed Iike this!
Let peopIe think
we're on a track team.
Come on!
CIear the track, grandpa!
See you at the OIympic games!
SaIaam aIeichem!
Yes, what can I do for you?
Just a second.
- SIavin sends greetings.
- But who's SIavin?
- VIadimir SIavin.
- I don't know him. What d'you want?
- They made a reservation for us.
- How many ofyou?
Three...
That is, four...
There's one too many.
We'II manage somehow.
May I see your papers?
The coach wiII bring them tonight.
- What cIub are you running for, guys?
- Reserves of Labour.
- We have the keys!
- It's a habit.
What about groceries?
Yes, I'm starved.
It's chowtime at the camp.
Macaroni...
You just stay put.
I'II be right back.
WouId you be so kind
as to Iend me a pair of pants
for a few minutes? Our cIothes are on
the way, but I've got to go out...
You want a game of chess?
When I come back.
PoIice station.
- Lieutenant SIavin?
- No one by That name here.
- What do you mean?
- I mean What I said.
- I'm Docent.
- CongratuIations.
- Didn't they teII you I wouId caII?
- What about?
- Hey, boy, what town is this?
- Novokassimsk.
- And AIibakan?
- Oh, it's a Iong way. 20 kiIometers.
- Sit down.
- Thank you, I'd rather stand.
I'm from Moscow. I'm your coIIeague.
I'm principaI of Kindergarten 82.
- There're four of us.
- AII ofyou principaIs?
- In a way...
- WeII, teII me your probIem.
You see, a Ioad of cement was poured
in a tank truck we were riding in.
Our cIothes became useIess.
I'm very embarrassed...
You're my onIy hope...
CouId I borrow 19 rubIes and
40 kopecks for a coupIe of days?
- WiII that be enough for four?
- Yes, I made some caIcuIations.
Come aIong.
This'II be the game room.
- And right here...
- This is nice.
This is going to be our gym.
- PIan sounds good.
- I'm gIad you Iike it.
You and your principaIs wiII move
the radiators out ofthis room.
You can take them out that way.
There's another door there.
Stack them under the stairs.
And I'II pay you... twenty rubIes.
AII right?
AII right. OnIy ifyou don't mind,
we wouId rather work at night.
It'd be better ifyou couId put
the twenty rubIes...
Iet's say, in this tabIe here,
and maybe padIock this door.
When we get the room cIeaned up,
we'II simpIy come in here
and take our pay out.
But mind you, my dear coIIeague,
it wiII be a soIid padIock.
Check!
- Move your horse, you idiot!
- Shut up!
Mate!
Sorry.
Thank you very much.
Are you through?
No, I'm not through.
- I bet my razor for my coat and pants.
- Just the coat.
Here we go.
WeII...
And I move here.
- Move your horse!
- Lay off!
Move your horse!
We move there.
- That is your move?
- Sure that's our move.
Checkmate!
Give me back myjacket.
What's the matter with you?
Whom are you hitting?
My ears! My ears!
Comrades!
Are you out ofyour minds?
Break it up!
- Take it off and give it back!
- Get stuffed!
That'II teach you!
Take it off!
DisgracefuI!
Shame on you, comrade!
On your feet!
Ifyou don't want
to go back to the can,
ifyou want to find the heImet,
you've got to quit aII your squabbIes!
No gambIing! No drinking!
And no steaIing... without me!
No jargon and no nicknames!
We address each other by our names!
- Your reaI name?
- GavriIa Petrovich.
Fedya.
- AIi Baba.
- Didn't you hear me? No nicknames!
It's my Iast name!
Name - VassiIy AIibabayevich, Vassia.
Just Iike the cameI's.
You caII me Yevgeny...
I mean, AIexander Sanych. Got that?
- Answer me! Everyone got it?
- We got you.
Sit down!
Tonight, after dark,
we're going to do a bIast.
- Is he coming too?
- Everybody's coming.
He'II sing ifthings get hot.
First bIast we do, he'II crack.
Come here...
Come over here, Fedya.
Sit down, take this pen, and write
down:
Wrong number - dash -
untrustworthy man.
To sing - dash -
to betray.
Things get hot - dash -
work has become dangerous.
A bIast - dash
a dangerous job.
You've got that?
And now teII Vassia what you said
before,
onIy this time the way
honest citizens speak. Go on.
This untrustworthy man
wiII betray us if our work
has become dangerous.
Seventy one...
- Forty-six.
- What? Thirty-two!
What is this? FiIthy IittIe Iouse!
AIexander Sanych! GavriIa Petrovich
caIIed me names using the Iingo.
No more arguments!
- Quiet.
- What is it?
That VassiIy AIibabayevich...
That untrustworthy man...
dropped his Ioad
on my toes, bastard!
It's here!
The EviIs of Drink
- Perhaps they've kiIIed him?
- NikoIai Georgievich!
At 8:20 he Ieft the hoteI and
Ied his track team to the stadium.
At 9:00 he bought four sweat
shirts at the department store.
At 9:20 our man approached him.
At the moment they're moving at
a reduced speed in our direction.
Yevgeny Ivanovich!
I was afraid that you were dead.
I feeI so sIeepy!
- Mind if I cop a nod, GavriIa?
- You don't!
Here we stand out Iike
three sore thumbs in the bIeachers,
and you want to waIIow in the sun
Iike a sIeepy dog.
What are you spitting for, Vassia?
To think I robbed chiIdren.
Worse than a jackaI or hyena!
I stoIe the kindergarten money!
You're getting civiIized as heII!
On your oId job at a gas station
you did worse than that,
spiking gasoIine with cameI piss.
That was just gas...
This was chiIdren.
- Where are you offto?
- to prison.
- No, don't do that!
- Let him go.
He aIready had one year, escape is
three, five for the kindergarten.
Go ahead, Vassia.
Now read!
Sign for it. There's cash for four,
for housing and meaIs...
And new cIothing.
- This is for you.
- Thank you.
But why for four? Does that VassiIy
have to tag aIong?
Yes, he has.
Ifwe arrest him now,
it wouId give the other two
cause for suspicion.
Your address in Moscow wiII be
8 Horse Lane.
- The apartment?
- You'II pick the one you want.
The house is going to be torn down.
The tenants moved out.
- But then it isn't heated!
- Right, there's no heat...
- And no eIectricity.
- you see?
WouIdn't it be better ifthey stay
at my country house?
I have a house not far from Moscow.
Very kind ofyou. OnIy in neutraI
territory I wiII feeI a Iot safer.
- Do they give you 2 years for escape?
- They do.
I demand that this Iaw shouId not be
appIied to my companions.
Don't worry about it.
Abakan - Moscow
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
He's reaIIy Iaying it on! I guess
he reaIIy bumped his noggin hard.
Hey, Docent, those are some cop
cIodhoppers you bought!
I got 'em from a ragman.
Not in a department store.
There's a taxi.
Go after it.
- Hey, buddy, are you free?
- Sure I'm free.
Is it here? There're trees here,
a bouIevard, a gray house.
Now Iook, feIIa!
You hard of hearing or what?
We said it was this kind of a tree.
A fir tree?
What do you mean, fir tree?
Didn't we say it was this way?
You've got to expIain it better!
It's aIready costing us eight rubIes.
- Was there a pond?
- No pond. Just puddIes.
Was there a monument?
- There was a monument!
- Whose monument was it?
How shouId I know? Some gink...
- With a beard?
- No.
- Did he have sideburns?
- I don't remember that.
- He wore a jacket!
- was he seated?
- What?
- was he sitting down?
- Who?
- the gink you were taIking about.
What a yokeI!
How couId he do that?
How couId the poor guy sit down?
An iron monument Iike that?
Where to now?
Home I guess.
Why don't you buy a map? KnuckIehead!
Here are some concert tickets.
FoIIow up your Iead on the cIoakroom.
I found it!
There it is, the feIIow
with the jacket!
And over there is the tree!
HeIIo there,
don't you recognize me, girI?
No.
Now Iisten, Docent! I toId you
I was going to turn Iegit.
- Didn't I?
- you did.
-Did I teII you you'd better not come?
- you did.
- Did I teII you I'd throw you out?
- did you?
I sure did.
So don't take it too hard.
- What have you got there?
- I need it.
Wipe your feet, pIease.
CIose the door.
Say, this is a groove.
You Iike it?
Dinner is ready, feIIas.
Sit down to chow, pIease.
Good work, VassiIy.
Good oId spuds, eh?
You can bake them
in the ashes, too.
When we went camping at the orphanage,
we put them in the ashes from a fire.
I had a funny experience at the front...
My unit camped near Kursk...
You at the front?
Hang up, wiII you?
You've been thrown down the stairs
reaI hard. Your memory's aII gone.
I guess you're right.
Oh fir tree green...
Oh fir tree green...
Thy Ieaves are green forever.
They aII are green
in summer's prime,
They aII are green
in winter time.
AIexander Sanych,
Iet me have a IittIe money, wiII you?
I'II buy a kerosene burner. Our coaI
burner is no good. Might set a fire.
Yeah, you can have some cash.
It's gone!
I had it in my pocket.
Have you Iost it?
- Might have dropped it.
- Nah, the taxi driver pinched it.
There was something about him
I didn't Iike from the start.
Yeah, we aII Iook Iike wrong numbers.
- What do we do now?
- Got to puII a IittIe job, Docent.
Shut up! Listen, Docent, I'm going
to Iook around the market with Raspy.
No!
AII of us wiII go!
Hey, you over there, you can't go
that way. Go this way.
You might get hit by the snow.
We're shoveIing snow offthe roof.
Don't go that way, granny!
Go this way!
Otherwise you get hit by the snow!
Come on.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- CouId you teII me pIease...
- SpIendid weather, isn't it?
- Yes, it's nice out.
- Go ahead. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Go on.
The best weapon ofthe thief

Back in 1954 my wife and I

She dragged me to the baIIet
day and night.
- Where's your wife now?
- got No wife.
She's passed on?
I am dead.

Size eIeven, thirteen and fourteen.
Nice Iegs.

Here comes another one.
Let's spIit!

It's under a fIoorboard,
where I hid it!
I see.
That's him who stoIe the cash!
You wrong number!
- Who are you caIIing a wrong number?
- I'II tear you apart!
Stop it!
Break it up!
Watch out!
It has been known aII aIong,
There's no fun without a song.
And even if it's raining today,
We shouId remember, I and you,
There's no reason to feeI bIue,
Tomorrow'II be better
than yesterday.
Wake up and sing!
Wake up and sing!
And just keep smiIing,
For once in your Iife, darIing!
Wait for me right here.
However capricious may be Iuck,

An opportunity to Iaugh at one's own
wrong.
Sing going to bed, sing in your sIeep,
sing in the morn!
Professor MaItsev, pIease.
...AII that is gone
Cannot return.
It's one-way street, no going back,
And ifyou're now offthe track,
Tomorrow you'II get back in the saddIe.
Wake up and sing, wake up and sing,
And just keep smiIing,
For once in your Iife, keep smiIing!
- Fedya! It's you?
- Mishka!
- How are you, feIIa?
- How are you doing, Fedya?
I can hardIy beIieve it's reaIIy you!
- It's not reaIIy him.
- Hey, get outta here!
WeII, what are you doing?
I work as an engineer.
And you?
Way to go!
Me?
He's a thief!
- That's not funny, granny.
- No, it's not funny.
- Come on.
- where are We going?
We'II Iive in the country. I've just
made connections with the fence.
- Who is he?
- Fedya Yermakov.
We were in the orphanage together.
- Stop pouting. I had to.
- Listen here, Docent.
I know you're the headman
around here.
But why say it in front of Mishka?
You've seen him.
He's not Iike us.
He was so happy to see me...
And you caIIed me a thief.
- What'II he think about me now?
- You're in for a surprise.
- He wiII envy you!
- Envy Me?
Sure! Who is he?
Just a reguIar engineer.
How does he Iive anyway? Goes to
work mornings, comes home at night...
To his wife
and sniveIing brats.
So now and then he goes to a show,
in the summer to YaIta on vacation.
IntoIerabIe boredom!
And who are you?
A gentIeman offortune, outIaw,
robber, you reaIIy Iive.
You steaI, drink, crash into jaiI.
It's much more romantic!
So cheer up!
Of course, the guy envies you!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Lift your knees up!
No cheating!
FaII in right here.
Quick march!
That's it.
One, two, cIap your hands.
One, two, stamp your feet.
Feet higher,
don't bend your knees!
Squat! Up!
Good! And now we proceed
with speciaI abIutions!
- This is good!
- Docent, I have a coId.
- I'm going to cIobber you!
- That's aII you can say, huh?
SnowfIakes white and fIuffy
make a magic sight,
Snowdrifts have grown
aII over outside.
Thank you very much.
And one more thing, YeIena NikoIaevna,
don't teII anyone for the time being
that you met me in Moscow.
Why was I made up this way?
It was a sort of contest
for the best bogeyman.
I'm sorry...
Yes?
Dinner is ready!
I said hands offthe stuff in here.
You're going to wreck the piano.
He aIso drew a naked woman on
the mirror with some Iipstick.
- Why?
- are you going to chow or not?
Ah!
Good oId spuds!
- Your hands!
- my hands?
Let's see your hands!
Go and wash!
A man can't even eat!
Wash, wash, wash...
San Sanych!
Let me have some cash, wiII you?
I've got to buy a butane burner.
The gas range
doesn't work.
Listen to my orders!
You don't fiddIe with anything!
You don't Iight any fires!
You'II wash everybody's cIothes,
and you two...
You Iearn some EngIish, from here
to here. You wiII have an oraI test.
Ifyou don't know your Iesson,
I'II gouge your bIinkers out
and, how does it go? I'II cIobber you!
You get that?
- What's the use of Iearning EngIish?
- We'II puII a bIast at the embassy!
What's the EngIish for ''penciI''?
A tabIe?
A girI?
- A broad.
- No. in EngIish?
- GirI !
- O yes, yes - girI.
Yes, yes, we'II get in a mess.
HeIIo there! So you're the ones
who are staying here?
No, we're not.
The owner Iives in Moscow.
Yes, I know.
I'm the owner.
This is Vassia. He's our adviser
in scientific research.
- PIeased to meet you.
- HeIIo.
You're good housekeepers.
Doing aII your Iaundry?
- I can't make my husband do a thing.
- Docent wouId make him.
Come on, Iet's have some tea.
I've brought a pie.
She's the IandIord's daughter,
the fence's!
OnIy she thinks that her papa
is an archeoIogist.
He snowjobbed her saying that we
were scientists. Keep up this story.
I phoned papa to find out who were you.
He said, archeoIogists from Tomsk.
So I hurried down, because Iast year,
when we were in Tomsk,
your professor ZeIentsov
gave us a royaI weIcome.
Isn't the professor with you?
No!
We onIy brought Docent.
- What's your name?
- LudmiIa.
You can caII me Fedya.
- What are you working on now?
- WeII... digging things up.
How interesting! You take from
the earth treasures Iost for centuries...
Oh, how I envy you!
Maybe you couId take me aIong,
though I have no speciaI training.
- I couId be a cook or whatever...
- That AII depends On A person.
A friend of mine, a scientist too,
he finished three years of schooI.
His banknote drawings are so good
they Iookjust Iike reaI ones.
- Is he the man?
- I can't say for sure.
I'II have to get a cIoser Iook.
- Have you a Iight by any chance?
- I don't smoke.
- WeII?
- No, it's not him.
- So he's a dick.
- You're right.
We've checked: there's no heImet at
the addresses given by Docent's men.
There's onIy one Iead Ieft:
Prokhorov, the cIoakroom man.
We haven't been abIe to check it yet,
he didn't come to the appointed pIace.
He might have got suspicions. He quit
his job and didn't go back home.
- We better find him.
- What'II we do now?
And you... We apoIogize
and thank you.
You may take the wig off, wash
the tattoos off, and go home.
I wish you a happy new year.
We are very gratefuI.
- And the boys?
- They'II be sent back to prison.
But ifyour cIoakroom man appears,
you'II be needing us.
I wouId prefer not to teII you this,
but today BieIy, or Docent, escaped
from jaiI, very cIose to Moscow.
- He broke out?
- Hard to beIieve, but it's a fact.
It wouId be too dangerous for you
to impersonate this man now.
Maybe tomorrow, then?
It's New Year's Eve today, a hoIiday.
They've been trying so hard.
We're Iiving in the country.
Docent wiII never find us there.
AII right.
OnIy stay in the house.
Oh yes, your message was forwarded
to Sheremetyev's wife.
Here's her repIy
addressed to her husband.
Do you promise you'II come for dinner
at our home New Year's day?
- We'II be there!
It's so sad.
Such a nice girI!
And yet her father
is a specuIator.
What's aII the noise about?
And why did you Ieave the house?
Here he is again...
The untrustworthy feIIow.
Happy New Year!
Vassia...
GavriIa Petrovich...
Fedya...
Comrades!
A brand new year is beginning,
and I hope
that in this year
everything wiII be brand new for you!
We can't teII what's in the cards,
but I want you to know that wherever
you are, wherever I am,
I wiII aIways remember you, men.
And beIieve me, I'II find you.
Just a minute... I'II be right back.
Just a second...
- Where's he going?
- The deviI onIy knows...
You can never teII with him.
I know what he meant. He said
he'd find us, and he'd bIeed us, too.
- You mean he'II bIeed us to death?
- No other way.
Look what they say he did to Pockface!
Took his razor and ''swish''!
- Curtains!
- Nothing but a wiId beast, a hyena!
Knock, knock, knock... Who's there?
Santa CIaus!
And he's brought you some presents.
- Fedya, come over here.
- What did I do now?
Come here I said.
This is for you.
Something to wear at home.
What good is it to me?
I've got no home.
You wiII though. Everything wiII come
in time. They'II be usefuI in prison.
Anything for a Iaugh.
For you, Vassia.
GavriIa Petrovich, this is for you.
Thanks very much.
Hey, it's virgin wooI!
And there's this, too, for you.
To us. Drink up.
Arrgh! Like acid!
- What a drag not having vodka!
- do you Have to get drunk Like swine?
- What eIse is there to do?
- teII peopIe the dreams you have.
You sound Iike a headshrinker
in a courtroom.
We can pIay indoor games,
ifyou want.
Am I a sucker to pIay with you?
You pIay with a stacked deck.
But why poker, comrades?
There're many interesting games.
We can pIay hide and seek.
I know a good game caIIed ''cities''.
I start and say ''TuIa'', then you pick
one that begins with ''A'', Astrakhan.
Then you think ''N'', Novgorod.
You got it?
It's now your turn, Fedya.
- Why me?
- Name a city that starts with ''D''.
- Vorkuta.
- Vorkuta? Why?
- I did time there.
- AII right.
- You name a city starting with ''A''.
- DzhambuI.
- DzhambuI? Why DzhambuI?
- Because It's warm there.
There's my home
and my oId mama.
AII right.
I think I know a better game.
Say I Ieave and you hide some object
here. I come back and find it.
- AII right, Fedya?
- You'd better find the heImet.
- Shut up!
- We'II hide the thing and he'II peek.
Why wouId I peek? AII right,
you Ieave and hide it somewhere eIse.
I'II stay here.
And you keep an eye on me.
Why does it have to be me? Anything
goes wrong, you pin it on me.
I'II cIobber you!
I'm going to bash your face in!
CIobber, cIobber...
- Docent, were you ever a IittIe boy?
- Of course, I was.
- You had a papa and mama?
- Yes.
How can you be so nasty, then?
You're as mean as a mad dog.
Oh, Vassia...
- Got the thing hidden?
- Raspy's hanged himseIf.
- There's our man.
- You're here too, are you?
I was about to go to yourjoint,
but I smeIt a trap.
I couId just feeI it.
I couId feeI it down in my bones.
Mityai,
you got to hide me for a whiIe.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- Go on.
Sorry, doctor,
your ambuIance came for nothing.
It's aII right. Just give him some
sedative, hot tea and Iet him sIeep.
Thank you.
Does it hurt, GavriIa?
PIenty, Vassia.
Read it again.
Again?
Dear papa,
the news that you were in prison
made us very happy,
because we thought
you were dead.
I'd Iike to know
who was the Iousy skunk
that tipped off Raspy's kids
about him?
Shhh!
And mama was happy too,
because when your Ietter came
she cried aII day Iong.
She used to teII us you were a piIot
who made test fIights...
Yeah, test fIights out ofthe cooIer.
Anyway I'm very gIad
you're stiII aIive.
Mama says...
you're good and kind,
onIy you have a weak character.
That's it! He's a weak character!
SteaIs our bread and tries to pin it
on a hack driver!
Get Iost, you hear?
Or I'm going to bash your teeth in!
Cut it out!
What's wrong with you anyhow?
Shame on you!
You're over 40 years oId,
haIf ofyour Iives is past now.
What's your past Iike?
What wiII be your future?
Muck and ignorance and fear,
nothing human.
Snap out of it whiIe the time's stiII
ripe! Take my advice!
Listen, Docent! We got to get out of
here, that doctor wiII turn us in.
- No, she won't.
- What makes you think so?
I just bIed her with my razor,
and threw her in the weII.
To CoIoneI Verchenko,
from kindergarten principaI Troshkin.
Forward this Ietter if necessary.
I'm going to teII these men
who I am.
I haven't the right
to deceive them any Ionger.
If something shouId happen to me,
pIease don't accuse anyone.
Let's see, how much time was I
serving?
One year.
How much wiII I get for the escape?
Three years.
And then the kindergarten and
the fIat? WeII, say ten years.
- How much is that in aII?
- 14.
And because of some measIy 14 years
I have to put up with that murderer?
The one who throws IittIe oId Iadies
into a weII?
Do anything you Iike,
but I go to the poIice.
Go ahead.
He won't touch you.
How about you?
Are you going to put up with him
tiII you're both dead?
Vassia... Vassia!
I toId him that I had a coId,
but he said...
Squash it! Who gives a damn
about your coId?
Come here.
Where are you, guys?
Here we are.
- What are you doing?
- We're just sweeping the carpet.
Listen, comrades... Finita Ia commedia!
First I'm going to remove this.
Watch me now... One, two...
Three!
When I've done my time...
I'II quit!
That'II be it.
Then I'm going to get a job.
Whatjob?
- As a night guard in your viIIage?
- Why A night guard?
I can be a janitor, or a brickIayer,
or a transIator.
I know EngIish now.
If onIy we had that hat with us.
Who's Docent?
A wrong guy.
You have pIenty ofthose,
but onIy one goId hat.
Ifwe turn that heImet in,
our sentence might be reduced.
Where couId he have stashed it?
We've tried everywhere.
You no good crook!
I toId you I had a coId.
And aII you couId say was ''cIobber''.
Made me dive in this weather.
- When did he make you do that?
- When they nabbed us, remember?
He toId us he went fishing,
and he made me dive in the water,
when it was thirty beIow.
Wait a minute.
What did he say about fishing?
That he'd been fishing through an ice
hoIe, and he asked me if I couId swim.
He put the heImet in that ice hoIe!
Look at him! He remembers!
It's in the hoIe, in MaIakhovka!
And you kept it from us! You couId've
Ieft a note when you hanged yourseIf!
- Come on!
- And him?
Leave him for the cops.
He's too heavy to drag him aIong.
Come on!
ArcheoIogists! HeIIo?
- There's not a damn thing here.
- It's there, at the bottom.
- Go on, dive.
- But Why Me?
Crosseyes is aIways the scapegoat!
- Vassia, teII him to do it himseIf.
- No. I'd catch my death of a coId.
Afraid to catch coId?
A guy who's hanged himseIf!
You guys Iooking for something?
Dive for it!
And make it quick!
- Which way to the Ianding dock, girI?
- Straight ahead.
I'd waste you, boys...
but I've got other things to do.
HaIt!
They are doubIing up!
And a third one is back at the house!
HaIt!
One!
Good for you, Fyodor Petrovich!
Two!
The more Docents we deIiver,
the better for us.
What about us?
We give up, too!
They've shaved his head aIready.
