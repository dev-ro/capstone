<b>The thought of murder</b>
<b>often evokes thoughts... </b>
<b>of the sea and of sailors. </b>
<b>What naturally follows</b>
<b>thoughts of the sea and murder... </b>
<b>is the thought</b>
<b>of love or sexuality. </b>
<b>Hey! Closing time! </b>
<b>Didn't you understand me, Robert? </b>
<b>It's closing time! </b>
<b>Then lock the door. </b>
<b>Robert is staying with me. </b>
<b>What did you say? </b>
<b>You heard me. </b>
<b>Robert is staying here with me tonight. </b>
<b>What do you think of that? </b>
<b>Of what? </b>
<b>After all, she's still your wife. </b>
<b>You think I should be jealous? </b>
<b>- It would be normal. </b>
<b>- Maybe, but what's normal? </b>
<b>We got a deal: </b>
<b>Lysiane does what she feels like... </b>
<b>and leaves me free</b>
<b>to do what I want, understand? </b>
<b>That's important for me. </b>
<b>- Chicago! </b>
<b>- Indeed. </b>
<b>Anyway, I want to read his cards. </b>
<b>Right, kiddo? </b>
<b>Hope you know</b>
<b>what you're doing. </b>
<b>You know</b>
<b>I know what I want. </b>
<b>You've lost, Mario. </b>
<b>Then let's have another drink. </b>
<b>You have a brother? </b>
<b>So what? </b>
<b>You never mentioned him. </b>
<b>Why should I? </b>
<b>You're very much alike, </b>
<b>aren't you? </b>
<b>That's what other people say... </b>
<b>but it isn't true. </b>
<b>Querelle is a sailor. </b>
<b>Maybe it's true. </b>
<b>And you love one another... </b>
<b>more than you'd like to. </b>
<b>Bullshit. </b>
<b>We're brothers... </b>
<b>and that's all there is to it. </b>
<b>Why are you shaking your head? </b>
<b>I don't know why... </b>
<b>but your brother</b>
<b>is in great danger. </b>
<b>In danger? </b>
<b>What kind of danger? </b>
<b>In danger of... </b>
<b>finding himself. </b>
<b>It's difficult to</b>
<b>brush past those shoulders... </b>
<b>profiles, curls... </b>
<b>those strong and supple boys... </b>
<b>without imagining them</b>
<b>capable of murder. </b>
<b>Finally, land. </b>
<b>And broads! </b>
<b>Juicy cunts. Hot and wet. </b>
<b>- Have you been in Brest before? </b>
<b>- Why? </b>
<b>Because they've got the raunchiest</b>
<b>whorehouse in the world. </b>
<b>The Feria. </b>
<b>Right. That's the name of the place. </b>
<b>Any of you guys know it? </b>
<b>- Yeah, but only from what I've heard. </b>
<b>- And what have you heard? </b>
<b>Nothing specific. </b>
<b>They say every trick has</b>
<b>to throw dice with the boss... </b>
<b>if he wants to catch a hooker. </b>
<b>Nono. That's the name</b>
<b>of the Feria boss. </b>
<b>That's right. Nono. </b>
<b>Why do they have to throw dice? </b>
<b>That's the rule. </b>
<b>When you win, </b>
<b>you get to have your pick. </b>
<b>When you lose, you have to</b>
<b>let the boss fuck you first. </b>
<b>Really? </b>
<b>Really, and I'm damn sure there's plenty</b>
<b>of guys who kinda like losing. </b>
<b>- If it turns them on. </b>
<b>- So what? </b>
<b>Once I have suffered the solitude</b>
<b>caused by my peculiarity long enough... </b>
<b>it may be that naked</b>
<b>I will hold these boys... </b>
<b>who shatter me with their</b>
<b>audacity and strength, against my body. </b>
<b>Though I hardly dare believe it. </b>
<b>With tears in my eyes, </b>
<b>I thank God for granting me this bliss. </b>
<b>My tears soften me. </b>
<b>I melt with their wetness</b>
<b>on my cheeks. I toss. </b>
<b>I roll in waves</b>
<b>of tenderness for these boys... </b>
<b>and their hard, shallow cheeks. </b>
<b>Querelle's great passion</b>
<b>is his own body in repose. </b>
<b>It is as if he's reflecting</b>
<b>himself in his own image. </b>
<b>He's looking at himself</b>
<b>as if through a magnifying glass. </b>
<b>He's scrutinizing the minute events</b>
<b>like an etymologist. </b>
<b>But how shining is his body</b>
<b>in the glory of his proud movements? </b>
<b>Your boots, sir. </b>
<b>Leave them there. </b>
<b>Anything else, sir? </b>
<b>No, thank you. </b>
<b>Since they themselves</b>
<b>wished to deny it... </b>
<b>the strange resemblance</b>
<b>of the two brothers... </b>
<b>seemed attractive only to others. </b>
<b>They met only in the evenings, </b>
<b>as late as possible... </b>
<b>in the one bed of a room... </b>
<b>near the one in which</b>
<b>their mother had lived in poverty. </b>
<b>Perhaps they met again</b>
<b>in their love for their mother... </b>
<b>but at such a deep level... </b>
<b>that they could not see it at all. </b>
<b>How long have you been in Brest? </b>
<b>Since yesterday. </b>
<b>Never thought</b>
<b>I'd run into you here. </b>
<b>I'm the lover</b>
<b>of the boss, Lysiane... </b>
<b>and have been</b>
<b>for the last six months. </b>
<b>- What about her husband? </b>
<b>- He's got interests of his own. </b>
<b>Why did you come here? </b>
<b>Got a little business to take care of. </b>
<b>I'm looking for a customer. </b>
<b>- Opium? </b>
<b>- Yeah, that's right. </b>
<b>No sweat. </b>
<b>Nono's the contact you want. </b>
<b>I'll introduce you. </b>
<b>What about the cop with him? </b>
<b>He's part of the furniture. </b>
<b>He ain't a cop in here. </b>
<b>Just the opposite. </b>
<b>He's our safety guarantee. </b>
<b>This is Querelle, my brother. </b>
<b>He has a deal for you. </b>
<b>He's all right. </b>
<b>Hello. </b>
<b>Good evening. </b>
<b>What's the deal? </b>
<b>Opium. </b>
<b>Five k's. </b>
<b>Ten thousand dollars. </b>
<b>You got it. </b>
<b>Cash. </b>
<b>Of course. </b>
<b>Querelle was frozen by Mario's gaze. </b>
<b>More than indifferent... </b>
<b>Mario's gaze and stance</b>
<b>were glacial. </b>
<b>At the same time, Querelle was struck</b>
<b>by the owner's extraordinary strength... </b>
<b>and the cop's beauty. </b>
<b>Never before had he</b>
<b>experienced true rivalry... </b>
<b>with which he had faced</b>
<b>in these two. </b>
<b>There's nothing fishy</b>
<b>about this, is there? </b>
<b>You don't have anything</b>
<b>to worry about with me. </b>
<b>You bring the merchandise</b>
<b>and you get the bread. Okay, buster? </b>
<b>And don't let Mario worry you. </b>
<b>Mario's part of the furniture. </b>
<b>Querelle had no doubt that the realm</b>
<b>over which this fellow ruled... </b>
<b>was a terrestrial one. </b>
<b>But was it possible the police</b>
<b>could be so handsome, so rich? </b>
<b>Let's have a drink! </b>
<b>When will you be here? </b>
<b>I got to figure how I'm gonna get</b>
<b>the stuff out, but I'll manage that. </b>
<b>I don't want to</b>
<b>get involved in no shit. </b>
<b>Don't wanna burn my fingers. </b>
<b>You want to dance with me? </b>
<b>Sure, why not? </b>
<b>My name's Lysiane. </b>
<b>I own the place. </b>
<b>You don't say. </b>
<b>I'm Robert's brother. </b>
<b>I know. </b>
<b>A penny for your thoughts, Querelle. </b>
<b>I acknowledge the existence</b>
<b>of authority in Mario. </b>
<b>I note his objective gestures. </b>
<b>Objectivity is the companion</b>
<b>of total power. </b>
<b>It holds sway over</b>
<b>unchallengeable moral authority. </b>
<b>It's a perfect social organization. </b>
<b>You win. </b>
<b>I get the feeling</b>
<b>you're pissed off. </b>
<b>It isn't my fault</b>
<b>my sister didn't show up. </b>
<b>You could have arranged</b>
<b>for her to get here. </b>
<b>I couldn't, Gil. </b>
<b>I swear it. </b>
<b>You know perfectly well</b>
<b>how much I like Paulette. </b>
<b>You like her, eh? </b>
<b>And you think that's funny, Roger? </b>
<b>Tell me if you think</b>
<b>that's funny! </b>
<b>You know... </b>
<b>I really want to make it</b>
<b>with your sister. </b>
<b>Can you imagine how I'd fuck her</b>
<b>if I held her like I'm holding you now? </b>
<b>You're Gil, </b>
<b>Gilbert Turko, a Pole. </b>
<b>You haven't been working</b>
<b>too long as a mason... </b>
<b>and you often lose your temper. </b>
<b>She really turns me on. </b>
<b>Man, would I screw her. </b>
<b>You got the same chops. </b>
<b>You got the same eyes. </b>
<b>Pity you're not her. </b>
<b>What are you going to tell her? </b>
<b>I'll do my best</b>
<b>to get her to come tomorrow. </b>
<b>Querelle was not used</b>
<b>to the idea that he was a monster. </b>
<b>Ayoung man, </b>
<b>he knew the terror of being alone... </b>
<b>caught in the world of the living. </b>
<b>Bravo! Bravo! </b>
<b>You know, for a little girl, </b>
<b>you sing that song just like a big boy. </b>
<b>Hurry up, baby. </b>
<b>Go on after your girl! </b>
<b>Otherwise she's gonna</b>
<b>drown herself! </b>
<b>Good to see you. </b>
<b>Why? </b>
<b>Got a job for you, </b>
<b>like the one back in Beirut. </b>
<b>Opium? </b>
<b>Right. </b>
<b>I'm going ashore</b>
<b>tomorrow afternoon. </b>
<b>At night I'll drop a rope</b>
<b>over the wall to the dock... </b>
<b>to the right of the customs house. </b>
<b>At 6:00 you take a boat, </b>
<b>tie the package to the rope... </b>
<b>then go back through customs. </b>
<b>We'll meet later back above. </b>
<b>How much? </b>
<b>Three hundred. </b>
<b>It's okay with me. </b>
<b>Perhaps love is a den of killers, </b>
<b>and if this is true... </b>
<b>will Querelle draw me into it? </b>
<b>And I? </b>
<b>When the time comes for me</b>
<b>to drown in my emotion for Querelle... </b>
<b>will there be</b>
<b>an alarm ringing for me? </b>
<b>We'd like you to perceive</b>
<b>that the sailor Querelle... </b>
<b>born of that solitude in which</b>
<b>the officer himself remained isolated... </b>
<b>was a figure comparable</b>
<b>to the angel of the Apocalypse... </b>
<b>whose feet rest upon the waters. </b>
<b>How ardently I desire</b>
<b>Querelle to reveal himself... </b>
<b>as a scoundrel</b>
<b>beneath that royal surface. </b>
<b>And then to lie at his feet... </b>
<b>to kiss his toes. </b>
<b>Little by little, </b>
<b>we realized that Querelle... </b>
<b>already inside our flesh, </b>
<b>was growing... </b>
<b>developing in our soul, </b>
<b>feeding off the best within us. </b>
<b>After discovering this about Querelle, </b>
<b>we want him to... </b>
<b>become the very hero</b>
<b>of those who are contemptuous. </b>
<b>Your papers please! </b>
<b>Pursuing his destiny, </b>
<b>his development within us... </b>
<b>we shall see how he goes about</b>
<b>realizing one single end... </b>
<b>which seems to be his own will</b>
<b>and his own destiny. </b>
<b>The scene we shall relate</b>
<b>is a transposition of the event... </b>
<b>which revealed Querelle to us. </b>
<b>We can say that it is comparable</b>
<b>to the Visitation. </b>
<b>Okay, you can go now. </b>
<b>My brother will take</b>
<b>care of everything. </b>
<b>No need to worry about him. </b>
<b>He's in Brest in the Feria. </b>
<b>In the Feria? </b>
<b>You got to be kidding. </b>
<b>They say the Feria's</b>
<b>a pretty weird place. </b>
<b>You can't believe every</b>
<b>line of bullshit you hear. </b>
<b>You know just as well as I do</b>
<b>what they say. </b>
<b>What of it? </b>
<b>He's making it</b>
<b>with the patronne. </b>
<b>That cop is covered with jewels. </b>
<b>I've got my jewels, </b>
<b>but I don't show 'em off. </b>
<b>I hear the boss</b>
<b>is helping himself too. </b>
<b>So what, if he digs it? </b>
<b>If he asked you, </b>
<b>would you do it with him? </b>
<b>Why not, if I felt like it? </b>
<b>I've done worse shit</b>
<b>than that before. </b>
<b>If you saw my brother, </b>
<b>he'd turn you on too. </b>
<b>You'd get together with him. </b>
<b>I wouldn't dig it. </b>
<b>I'm telling you</b>
<b>you would. </b>
<b>Want a smoke? </b>
<b>Nono would like you. </b>
<b>You're a cute chicken. </b>
<b>He wouldn't have a chance with me. </b>
<b>And me? </b>
<b>Would I have better luck with you? </b>
<b>Cut that shit out! </b>
<b>Querelle listened to the drums and pipes</b>
<b>performing for him alone. </b>
<b>The offices for the dead. </b>
<b>He wrapped himself in prudence, </b>
<b>waited for the angel to strike. </b>
<b>In a very indistinct way, Querelle</b>
<b>sensed that everything was not finished. </b>
<b>He still had to accomplish</b>
<b>the final formality: </b>
<b>his own execution. </b>
<b>Tell me what turns you on about</b>
<b>Lysiane that makes you all excited. </b>
<b>Explain it to me. </b>
<b>That's simple enough. </b>
<b>I like her. </b>
<b>Okay, you know the rules of the game. </b>
<b>If you win, Lysiane is yours. </b>
<b>If I win, you're mine. </b>
<b>Twenty-nine. </b>
<b>Twenty-five. </b>
<b>You lose. </b>
<b>Death sentence. </b>
<b>What did you say? </b>
<b>Nothing. </b>
<b>We won't kiss. </b>
<b>Goes without saying. </b>
<b>I'll just give my ass. </b>
<b>That's all. </b>
<b>That's right. </b>
<b>That's all there is to it. </b>
<b>Are you ready? </b>
<b>You got to be careful, okay? </b>
<b>I don't think</b>
<b>this is exactly painless. </b>
<b>Don't worry. This isn't</b>
<b>the first time you've been fucked. </b>
<b>This is the first time. </b>
<b>You just take my word for it. </b>
<b>Don't you try any</b>
<b>funny business with me. </b>
<b>Don't hand me that shit. </b>
<b>Not me. </b>
<b>Or do you think</b>
<b>I'm some kind of idiot? </b>
<b>Don't you think I saw you cheating</b>
<b>when we threw the dice? </b>
<b>That'll do. </b>
<b>Don't forget</b>
<b>I didn't ask you to do it. </b>
<b>Now lie down! </b>
<b>- You're wrong. I wanted your wife. </b>
<b>- Come on. </b>
<b>Good. </b>
<b>Were you a sailor? </b>
<b>- I was Zephir. </b>
<b>- Zephir? </b>
<b>Legionnaire in a</b>
<b>prison detachment. </b>
<b>Lie down on the table. </b>
<b>Come on. </b>
<b>It's gonna be fast. </b>
<b>That's how I like you. </b>
<b>This doesn't hurt. </b>
<b>I'll have to give you that. </b>
<b>You know your job. </b>
<b>Here goes nothing. </b>
<b>Morning, Lieutenant. </b>
<b>Hello, Querelle. </b>
<b>I must say, you're doing</b>
<b>a very good job. </b>
<b>Without even telling me, </b>
<b>you've offered to do another duty. </b>
<b>- Who ordered you to shovel coal? </b>
<b>- Nobody, sir. </b>
<b>Don't you find your job with me</b>
<b>a little more pleasant? </b>
<b>Sure, Lieutenant. Absolutely. </b>
<b>But this was a voluntary decision</b>
<b>to take over for a buddy. </b>
<b>They could have</b>
<b>found somebody else. </b>
<b>You look beautiful like this. </b>
<b>Do you find it so all that pleasant</b>
<b>swallowing coal dust? </b>
<b>No sir, but... </b>
<b>Yes? What were you going to say? </b>
<b>Nothing, sir. </b>
<b>Anything else you wanted, sir? </b>
<b>- No, why? </b>
<b>-Just asking, sir. </b>
<b>- And what are you going to do now? </b>
<b>- Nothing, sir. I'm at your disposal. </b>
<b>It's just that all my buddies</b>
<b>are down there alone. </b>
<b>Fine, then go back. </b>
<b>Each man kills the thing he loves</b>
<b>Each man kills the thing he loves</b>
<b>Your brother's a hot little number. </b>
<b>- Querelle? What do you mean by that? </b>
<b>- It worked real good with him. </b>
<b>- What worked? Your business deal? </b>
<b>- That worked out fine too. </b>
<b>But I mean something else. </b>
<b>I made it. </b>
<b>With Querelle? </b>
<b>That's news to me. </b>
<b>I swear it. </b>
<b>But please don't talk about it. </b>
<b>Not with him either. </b>
<b>So what? </b>
<b>It's none of my fuckin' business. </b>
<b>But you're not gonna make me believe</b>
<b>you fucked Querelle. </b>
<b>I swear. </b>
<b>I fucked him in the ass. </b>
<b>And when I pulled my cock out, it was</b>
<b>covered with shit, if you want to know. </b>
<b>I've done it with damn near</b>
<b>all of them, except for you. </b>
<b>I never wanted you, understand? </b>
<b>This way I can say my wife slept</b>
<b>with nothing but assholes. </b>
<b>You're the only exception. </b>
<b>I don't know why. </b>
<b>I think we could've made it, </b>
<b>but I just didn't want to. </b>
<b>You don't interest me in the least. </b>
<b>You don't. </b>
<b>You're not any</b>
<b>uglier than the others. </b>
<b>I'm just not interested. </b>
<b>You're a little too screwy for me. </b>
<b>You should know that. </b>
<b>Hi, Mario. How's it going? </b>
<b>Comme ci, comme ça. </b>
<b>How are you? </b>
<b>Just fine. </b>
<b>- What you grinning about? </b>
<b>- Nothing special. </b>
<b>I just fucked Robert's brother. </b>
<b>Maybe that's why. </b>
<b>No kidding! Really? </b>
<b>It wasn't Robert, but what the hell? </b>
<b>It was his brother. </b>
<b>Look at Nono. </b>
<b>Sometimes there's something</b>
<b>so female about him... </b>
<b>especially when he does</b>
<b>one of those sweet, silly gestures. </b>
<b>But this Querelle is an okay guy. </b>
<b>Hi, Nono. </b>
<b>Let's go outside. </b>
<b>Is that what you wanted? </b>
<b>Cornholer! </b>
<b>Cornholer! </b>
<b>Letting a nigger fuck you! </b>
<b>The two brothers resembled</b>
<b>each other more and more. </b>
<b>The combat in which they were engaged</b>
<b>was more like a lovers'quarrel. </b>
<b>Say it one more time! </b>
<b>Call me a cornholer again! </b>
<b>Say it one more time! </b>
<b>I won't say it! </b>
<b>I cross the river</b>
<b>of creeping vines. </b>
<b>Help me. </b>
<b>I'm coming to your shore. </b>
<b>That will be hard, brother. </b>
<b>I can feel your resistance. </b>
<b>What do you say? </b>
<b>I can hardly hear it. </b>
<b>Jump on my laugh. Hold tight to it. </b>
<b>Don't worry about my pain. Jump! </b>
<b>Be yourself! </b>
<b>I'm becoming myself. </b>
<b>Talk more quietly. </b>
<b>I'm closer now. </b>
<b>I love you more than myself. </b>
<b>My hate was simply a camouflage. </b>
<b>A dangerous melancholy</b>
<b>draws me close to you... </b>
<b>but my battles separate us. </b>
<b>My laughter is the sun. </b>
<b>It drives away the shadows</b>
<b>you cast on me. </b>
<b>I seek out the daggers of the night. </b>
<b>I set up barricades. </b>
<b>My laughter locks me in. </b>
<b>It draws me away from you. </b>
<b>- You are beautiful. </b>
<b>- You are beautiful too. </b>
<b>Be quiet. </b>
<b>We mustn't lose ourselves</b>
<b>in an all too perfect unity. </b>
<b>Set your hounds and wolves on me! </b>
<b>To what avail? </b>
<b>Every fight crowns you</b>
<b>with a painful glow. </b>
<b>Don't lose courage. Work! </b>
<b>I love him. </b>
<b>The officers all bore me. </b>
<b>Why can't I be a sailor? </b>
<b>I remain standing in the wind. </b>
<b>Cold and headache</b>
<b>clamp my forehead... </b>
<b>and crown me</b>
<b>with an iron tiara. </b>
<b>I am growing and melting. </b>
<b>A naval officer. </b>
<b>When I was a young man, </b>
<b>even when I chose this career... </b>
<b>I didn't realize what a perfect alibi</b>
<b>a naval career provides. </b>
<b>It justifies celibacy. </b>
<b>Women don't ask, </b>
<b>"Why aren't you married?"</b>
<b>They pity you for knowing</b>
<b>only the transient affairs... </b>
<b>and never the true love. </b>
<b>The sea, the solitude... </b>
<b>Nobody asks me</b>
<b>whether or not I'm engaged. </b>
<b>Neither my comrades... </b>
<b>nor my mother. </b>
<b>From the time I fell in love</b>
<b>with Querelle... </b>
<b>I've become</b>
<b>less of a disciplinarian. </b>
<b>My love makes me softer. </b>
<b>The more I love Querelle... </b>
<b>the more gentle and definite... </b>
<b>the sadder</b>
<b>the woman in myself becomes... </b>
<b>because she cannot</b>
<b>achieve fulfillment. </b>
<b>During one of these</b>
<b>strange revelations... </b>
<b>defining my relationship</b>
<b>with Querelle... </b>
<b>I think amidst all these sorrows</b>
<b>and inner defeats... </b>
<b>"What's the point?"</b>
<b>That sailor got his throat slit? </b>
<b>Yeah. Nobody knows</b>
<b>who killed him. </b>
<b>Did you know him, Querelle? </b>
<b>Yeah. We all know each other. </b>
<b>I didn't know him well. </b>
<b>There is a masculine passivity... </b>
<b>which is expressed... </b>
<b>in the indifference</b>
<b>towards courtship... </b>
<b>the completely relaxed... </b>
<b>anticipation of the body... </b>
<b>concerning his role... </b>
<b>in the taking or giving of passion. </b>
<b>Want to shoot dice? </b>
<b>7 orders, 14 pays</b>
<b>and 21 's gotta drink, okay? </b>
<b>- Want to play too, Querelle? </b>
<b>- Sure, why not? </b>
<b>Stop the fighting! </b>
<b>Stop the fighting! </b>
<b>Between such men, </b>
<b>and for them alone... </b>
<b>a universe is established from which</b>
<b>the idea of woman is banished. </b>
<b>The absence of woman</b>
<b>forces the two males... </b>
<b>to draw a little femininity</b>
<b>from within each other... </b>
<b>to invent the woman. </b>
<b>You know, I know. Just ask him. </b>
<b>I'm okay. You can ask anybody you want. </b>
<b>You know, I know. Just ask him. </b>
<b>I'm okay. You can ask anybody you want. </b>
<b>And you? </b>
<b>You're in the navy. </b>
<b>I've met plenty of sailors</b>
<b>who were into that. </b>
<b>That didn't stop them</b>
<b>from being real men. </b>
<b>Maybe. </b>
<b>And if you let Nono fuck you, </b>
<b>why not me? </b>
<b>But you shouldn't believe</b>
<b>everything you hear about Nono. </b>
<b>I know all about life. </b>
<b>Believe me. </b>
<b>Okay, I did it with Nono. </b>
<b>But don't start</b>
<b>getting any funny ideas. </b>
<b>I'm no fairy. </b>
<b>I know that. </b>
<b>- But Nono did the fucking, right? </b>
<b>- Right. </b>
<b>- So? </b>
<b>- Forget it. </b>
<b>You don't have to prove to me</b>
<b>that you're a man. </b>
<b>We know... </b>
<b>we're both men. </b>
<b>You went to bed with Nono</b>
<b>and that's no crime. </b>
<b>Just as long as</b>
<b>he took good care of you. </b>
<b>I hope you got</b>
<b>your share of the pleasure. </b>
<b>I won't say no. </b>
<b>I could do any guy</b>
<b>a lot of good. </b>
<b>You see, if it's fun, </b>
<b>there's nothing wrong with it. </b>
<b>I'm sure Nono enjoyed it just as much. </b>
<b>He's a pretty hot number. </b>
<b>And you're very pretty. </b>
<b>- I look just like the next guy. </b>
<b>- Bullshit! I can just see Nono now. </b>
<b>He must've had a hard-on</b>
<b>the first moment he saw you. </b>
<b>- Tell me, is he good at it? </b>
<b>- Cut it. </b>
<b>Tell me, is he a master of his craft? </b>
<b>What's so interesting</b>
<b>about it for you? </b>
<b>Gets you all excited, doesn't it? </b>
<b>Maybe you'd like</b>
<b>a little taste of it yourself. </b>
<b>Why not, if it's nice? </b>
<b>- Tell me, how does he do it? </b>
<b>- He does it well. </b>
<b>Are you satisfied now? </b>
<b>- Did you come? Was it super? </b>
<b>- Try it yourself. </b>
<b>- Tell me. Is it nice? </b>
<b>- It's not bad. </b>
<b>When he first puts it in, </b>
<b>that's a little painful... </b>
<b>then it's okay. </b>
<b>Seriously, is it nice? </b>
<b>I just did it for the first time. </b>
<b>It's different than I thought. </b>
<b>I'll bet he's got a big prick. </b>
<b>Did you like his prick? </b>
<b>I didn't pay any attention to that. </b>
<b>Well, if it's bugging you, </b>
<b>we can stop talking about it. </b>
<b>No, it's not bugging me. </b>
<b>When I talk about this stuff, </b>
<b>I get a mother of a hard-on. Believe me. </b>
<b>You're kidding! </b>
<b>- Don't you believe me? </b>
<b>- What, this gives you a hard-on? </b>
<b>Check it out. </b>
<b>Come on. Touch it. </b>
<b>Bullshit! </b>
<b>You haven't got one! </b>
<b>Go on. Touch it. </b>
<b>You'll feel it all right. </b>
<b>Nothing. </b>
<b>You call that a hard-on? </b>
<b>Come on. Press it. </b>
<b>It's a monster! </b>
<b>Sure, the cloth makes it bigger. </b>
<b>Reach inside. You'll see. </b>
<b>Open it. </b>
<b>You'll see I'm not lying. </b>
<b>You're right. Not bad. </b>
<b>You like it? </b>
<b>I told you, </b>
<b>size doesn't interest me. </b>
<b>Come on. </b>
<b>Give me a hand job. </b>
<b>This is supposed to be soup? </b>
<b>This is fucking dishwater! </b>
<b>Piss broth, </b>
<b>that's what that is! </b>
<b>You need vegetables in soup... </b>
<b>but vegetables are getting</b>
<b>harder and harder to find. </b>
<b>Maybe we have to tighten up</b>
<b>our belts a little more. </b>
<b>Maybe we could find some vegetables</b>
<b>around here somewhere. </b>
<b>Do you think so? </b>
<b>Maybe someone shoved</b>
<b>some up his ass. </b>
<b>There are people who dig that. </b>
<b>Eat through their assholes. </b>
<b>You thought out this little number, </b>
<b>didn't you, Theo? </b>
<b>Well, let me tell you one thing: </b>
<b>I'm not going to put up</b>
<b>with this shit much longer! </b>
<b>What are you talking about? </b>
<b>Gets you horny, turns you on, </b>
<b>doesn't it? </b>
<b>But don't worry. </b>
<b>I'll always be here when you need me. </b>
<b>You want to fuck me? </b>
<b>Don't be embarrassed! </b>
<b>Go ahead! </b>
<b>And you guys laugh. </b>
<b>You think it's funny! </b>
<b>Is there anybody else</b>
<b>who wants to fuck me? </b>
<b>Please! </b>
<b>Cut it out, Gil. </b>
<b>Your hassle with Theo's</b>
<b>none of our business. </b>
<b>What? I've got</b>
<b>no hassle with Gil. </b>
<b>I don't give a shit about him. </b>
<b>Not one little shit! </b>
<b>Why didn't I smack Theo</b>
<b>in the mouth right then and there? </b>
<b>Why didn't I push</b>
<b>that motherfucker's face in? </b>
<b>Just 'cause the guy keeps</b>
<b>paying for my drinks? </b>
<b>I hate him because</b>
<b>he has power over me. </b>
<b>I wanted to be his friend, </b>
<b>but not like that. </b>
<b>He made a fool of me</b>
<b>in front of all of them. </b>
<b>And all because I didn't</b>
<b>smash him in the mouth soon enough. </b>
<b>Why didn't I push</b>
<b>that motherfucker's face in? </b>
<b>Paulette... </b>
<b>you sweet little piglet</b>
<b>with that adorable pussy. </b>
<b>You're going to get</b>
<b>another taste of my rod! </b>
<b>I'm a man. </b>
<b>I even fuck guys! </b>
<b>And I fuck you too, Theo! </b>
<b>Why didn't I push</b>
<b>that motherfucker's face in? </b>
<b>I can put you away, Theo! </b>
<b>Whenever I feel like it. </b>
<b>- Roger! </b>
<b>- Hi, Gil. </b>
<b>- Roger! </b>
<b>- Hi, Gil. </b>
<b>Roger, my mate, </b>
<b>let's have a drink together. </b>
<b>- How's it going? </b>
<b>- Okay, I guess. </b>
<b>You don't have to</b>
<b>worry about me. </b>
<b>There ain't no Theo anymore. </b>
<b>You don't have to put me</b>
<b>in the same boat as him. </b>
<b>I'm no faggot, </b>
<b>but he ain't a man. </b>
<b>He's a whore, a cocksucker. </b>
<b>You and me, we're friends. </b>
<b>And we've got a right to be. </b>
<b>But he's just a dirty motherfucker. </b>
<b>I think you've had</b>
<b>a little bit too much to drink. </b>
<b>Don't get in a state. </b>
<b>I paid for it</b>
<b>with my own money. </b>
<b>He can take his money... </b>
<b>and shove it</b>
<b>right up his ass! </b>
<b>I tell you, he's nothing... </b>
<b>and I'm going to crush him. </b>
<b>Hello, Gil. </b>
<b>It's you, Theo! </b>
<b>Are you buying? </b>
<b>I'm here with a friend. </b>
<b>Sure. Why not, honey? </b>
<b>And now you're not</b>
<b>with us anymore! </b>
<b>How did you meet Gil? </b>
<b>How did you meet Gil? </b>
<b>Easy, just like that. </b>
<b>He was after my sister. </b>
<b>Did he have an affair</b>
<b>with your sister? </b>
<b>With Paulette? No. Why? </b>
<b>Because we found these pictures</b>
<b>under his pillow. </b>
<b>I've nothing to say to that. </b>
<b>Did you make it with him? </b>
<b>Did you and he have an affair? </b>
<b>Never, Inspector. I swear it. </b>
<b>And this Theo, </b>
<b>the one Gil murdered... </b>
<b>did you make it with him? </b>
<b>Jesus Christ, I only knew him</b>
<b>from seeing him around. </b>
<b>But this Gil must</b>
<b>surely have tried to seduce you. </b>
<b>No, never, Inspector. </b>
<b>Whatever gave you that idea? </b>
<b>Simply because Gil is gay. </b>
<b>- That's not true! </b>
<b>- How could you be so goddamn sure? </b>
<b>Because he was after my sister, </b>
<b>that's why. </b>
<b>He never tried to touch you? </b>
<b>- What do you mean, "touch" me? </b>
<b>- You know what I mean. </b>
<b>Did he do anything indecent to you? </b>
<b>I already told you: nothing. </b>
<b>Did he ever run his hands</b>
<b>over your pants? </b>
<b>Didn't he even try</b>
<b>to touch your crotch? </b>
<b>No. He never did. </b>
<b>It's like I said. </b>
<b>He never touched me. </b>
<b>Okay. </b>
<b>They couldn't pull anything out of him, </b>
<b>who now loved Gil all the more. </b>
<b>At first he loved him as a child whose</b>
<b>imagination is quick and exhilarating. </b>
<b>Crime enabled him</b>
<b>to penetrate a world... </b>
<b>where feelings are violent. </b>
<b>You can go now. </b>
<b>What sudden desire? </b>
<b>I am nothing but desire. </b>
<b>At first, only mechanically... </b>
<b>my hands formed</b>
<b>female breasts on my chest... </b>
<b>as if they had been grafted there. </b>
<b>I was happy. </b>
<b>I went through the motions again, </b>
<b>and I feel happy. </b>
<b>I am filled. </b>
<b>I take my hands away, </b>
<b>I am filled. </b>
<b>- Are you looking for me? </b>
<b>- Yes, we are. </b>
<b>- That is if you're Lieutenant Seblon. </b>
<b>- Yes, I am. </b>
<b>We are from the police. </b>
<b>It has to do with that murdered sailor. </b>
<b>You mean Vic? </b>
<b>That's what I thought. </b>
<b>You don't say. </b>
<b>Yes, we're investigating</b>
<b>this Vic Rivette case... </b>
<b>and so far we haven't</b>
<b>made much progress. </b>
<b>- Really? </b>
<b>- Yes. </b>
<b>But maybe you could</b>
<b>tell me if this Vic Rivette... </b>
<b>had a special relationship</b>
<b>with any of his mates. </b>
<b>How do you think a love relationship</b>
<b>like that could be recognized? </b>
<b>I didn't say anything</b>
<b>about a "love relationship."</b>
<b>No? Then I probably</b>
<b>misunderstood you. </b>
<b>Probably... </b>
<b>but perhaps you know more</b>
<b>about this Vic's associations. </b>
<b>The physical relationships of my boys</b>
<b>have nothing to do with me. </b>
<b>And even if someone had killed Vic... </b>
<b>in connection with one of these</b>
<b>adventures, I wouldn't be informed. </b>
<b>Of course, Lieutenant, </b>
<b>but it would be possible... </b>
<b>that you might have heard</b>
<b>something about it, wouldn't it? </b>
<b>You must be joking. </b>
<b>I don't spy on my men. </b>
<b>Besides, take it from me. </b>
<b>These young people, when they get</b>
<b>involved with shady individuals... </b>
<b>they certainly don't</b>
<b>like to talk about it. </b>
<b>I believe these meetings... </b>
<b>are enveloped in dark secrets. </b>
<b>These shady characters</b>
<b>are extremely well-organized. </b>
<b>You seem to have given this particular</b>
<b>matter quite a bit of thought. </b>
<b>It only seems like it. </b>
<b>Basically, I'm not at all interested</b>
<b>in this kind of thing. </b>
<b>Really? </b>
<b>By the way, has your alibi</b>
<b>been checked out yet? </b>
<b>My alibi? </b>
<b>But of course. You can</b>
<b>check your files on that. </b>
<b>Are you sure? </b>
<b>All the best, Lieutenant. </b>
<b>All the best. </b>
<b>Do I have charms</b>
<b>which might conquer another? </b>
<b>And who, besides myself, has been</b>
<b>conquered by Querelle's charms? </b>
<b>How could I become him? </b>
<b>I push up my pajama sleeves... </b>
<b>to keep them from getting</b>
<b>in my way when I jerk off. </b>
<b>This simple motion</b>
<b>makes a man out of me. </b>
<b>Thus I appear as a lion tamer</b>
<b>before Querelle. </b>
<b>But all of this</b>
<b>will end tragically. </b>
<b>Have the cops questioned you? </b>
<b>Yeah, but I didn't say a word. </b>
<b>What was there to say? </b>
<b>Right. </b>
<b>And Paulette? </b>
<b>What's Paulette doing now? </b>
<b>Nothing special. </b>
<b>She still hasn't</b>
<b>gone back to work. </b>
<b>She just sits around the house. </b>
<b>Did you talk to her about me? </b>
<b>I don't think that's a good idea. </b>
<b>It's too dangerous. Paulette can't</b>
<b>always keep her trap shut. </b>
<b>Your picture was in the paper. </b>
<b>They say you've got that sailor</b>
<b>on your conscience too. </b>
<b>Says who? </b>
<b>The police. </b>
<b>It was in the paper. </b>
<b>Bullshit! </b>
<b>They don't believe</b>
<b>that fairy tale themselves. </b>
<b>They found your lighter</b>
<b>next to the corpse. </b>
<b>My lighter? </b>
<b>God, I must have lost that ages ago, </b>
<b>didn't I? </b>
<b>- I think so. </b>
<b>- There, you see? </b>
<b>Boy, your sister! </b>
<b>Could I do with</b>
<b>a piece of her right now! </b>
<b>She's so cute. </b>
<b>- She looks like me. </b>
<b>- I know. </b>
<b>But she's prettier. </b>
<b>If I were holding her</b>
<b>like I'm holding you now... </b>
<b>I'd make out with her</b>
<b>like crazy. </b>
<b>Too bad you're not a girl. </b>
<b>Really? </b>
<b>You're definitely</b>
<b>as pretty as a girl. </b>
<b>What's the matter? </b>
<b>Scared? </b>
<b>No. </b>
<b>What then? </b>
<b>What do you think I want? </b>
<b>You don't feel safe</b>
<b>with a guy like me... </b>
<b>do you? </b>
<b>What do you mean? </b>
<b>If I didn't, I wouldn't</b>
<b>have come here, would I? </b>
<b>Right. </b>
<b>You've got to see Robert. </b>
<b>I've been thinking this over. </b>
<b>He and his friends might be able</b>
<b>to help me get out of here. </b>
<b>Okay, Gil. </b>
<b>I'll try to get</b>
<b>in contact with Robert. </b>
<b>I think it's better you leave now. </b>
<b>- Yes? </b>
<b>- Come over here. </b>
<b>I know you. </b>
<b>You're that friend ofTurko's. </b>
<b>Gil Turko, the one</b>
<b>who committed the murder. </b>
<b>Don't you know me? </b>
<b>Yeah, you're Querelle... </b>
<b>Robert's brother. </b>
<b>Right. </b>
<b>Thought I might be able to help</b>
<b>your friend if he's still in Brest. </b>
<b>What do you think? </b>
<b>Well, since you're Robert's brother... </b>
<b>I'll be right back. </b>
<b>An uneasiness filled Querelle, </b>
<b>troubling his mind. </b>
<b>For the first time he was</b>
<b>going to meet another criminal... </b>
<b>a murderer of his own stature with whom</b>
<b>he would be able to talk business. </b>
<b>I met Querelle. </b>
<b>You know, Robert's brother? </b>
<b>He wants to help you. </b>
<b>Should I bring him here? </b>
<b>Sure! Why didn't you</b>
<b>bring him in the first place? </b>
<b>- I thought that... </b>
<b>- Hurry up! Get him! </b>
<b>It's okay. Come with me. </b>
<b>- Thanks, kid. </b>
<b>- My name's Roger. Roger Bataille. </b>
<b>Thanks, Roger. Roger Bataille. </b>
<b>Now, in this abandoned prison... </b>
<b>Querelle was to meet</b>
<b>a young fellow who had killed. </b>
<b>This thought filled</b>
<b>him with tenderness. </b>
<b>The murderer was an awkward kid... </b>
<b>a murderer for nothing. </b>
<b>A fool. </b>
<b>But, thanks to Querelle, he would be</b>
<b>adorned with a true murder. </b>
<b>Tell me... </b>
<b>why did you</b>
<b>knock that sailor off? </b>
<b>I don't understand that. </b>
<b>Come on. Tell me. </b>
<b>Why did you do that to the sailor? </b>
<b>He didn't do it. </b>
<b>- If he didn't, who did? </b>
<b>- Word of honor. I didn't do it. </b>
<b>I can't tell you who did it, </b>
<b>but I swear... </b>
<b>it wasn't me. </b>
<b>The paper said you did it. </b>
<b>I believe you... </b>
<b>but you'll never</b>
<b>convince the police. </b>
<b>They found your lighter</b>
<b>next to the body. </b>
<b>Get out, Roger. Get lost! </b>
<b>I can't stand another minute</b>
<b>of you today. Get the hell out! </b>
<b>I lost my lighter. </b>
<b>I didn't even notice it. </b>
<b>How can a lighter</b>
<b>be so important? </b>
<b>Finally I know why you won't let</b>
<b>the other girls wear black lingerie. </b>
<b>Why? </b>
<b>Because you alone are</b>
<b>ennobled by this black. </b>
<b>It makes you so beautiful... </b>
<b>gives you a solemn air... </b>
<b>and at the same time</b>
<b>you are unbearably hot. </b>
<b>Do I make you hot? </b>
<b>Want to see? </b>
<b>Okay, get started. </b>
<b>You're alone in the world. </b>
<b>The night lies</b>
<b>over the solitude... </b>
<b>of an endless space. </b>
<b>Like a double mirror image</b>
<b>of your brother... </b>
<b>you live in your double solitude. </b>
<b>You upset me. </b>
<b>There's no reason to hide it. </b>
<b>Your similarity does me in. </b>
<b>I'm sick of your obscenities. </b>
<b>Right? </b>
<b>Your obscenities. </b>
<b>Don't you think I know? </b>
<b>I'm sick of it. </b>
<b>All you ever look at</b>
<b>is yourselves. </b>
<b>I'm not even there for you. </b>
<b>Who am I then? </b>
<b>Where do I fit in? </b>
<b>You only live</b>
<b>in your brother's eyes. </b>
<b>Inside your brother, </b>
<b>and he lives inside of you. </b>
<b>There's no room</b>
<b>for me in between. </b>
<b>I'm at the door. </b>
<b>I'm too fat. </b>
<b>That's it. I'm too fat! </b>
<b>Her mind was clouded</b>
<b>by the extreme, precise... </b>
<b>indescribable melting of those</b>
<b>two muscular, sinewy bodies. </b>
<b>She tried to force</b>
<b>the soft, dissolving mass... </b>
<b>of her own sumptuous body</b>
<b>between them. </b>
<b>Robert... </b>
<b>my heart's delight... </b>
<b>I wish you'd be</b>
<b>alone with me once. </b>
<b>You make me unhappy. </b>
<b>I'm afraid for you. </b>
<b>Afraid you might not</b>
<b>be free anymore. </b>
<b>When Madame Lysiane</b>
<b>found herself before Querelle... </b>
<b>her gaze went to his fly</b>
<b>in spite of herself. </b>
<b>Perhaps this evening</b>
<b>the cloth would be less stiff... </b>
<b>would clearly outline</b>
<b>his cock and balls... </b>
<b>allowing Madame Lysiane to note a</b>
<b>difference between the two brothers. </b>
<b>She still hoped that the sailor's cock</b>
<b>would be smaller than Robert's. </b>
<b>Lysiane waited</b>
<b>a long time for love. </b>
<b>Men never did</b>
<b>get her all that excited. </b>
<b>It wasn't until she was around 40... </b>
<b>that she developed an appetite</b>
<b>for men with hard muscles. </b>
<b>When she enjoyed happiness, </b>
<b>she started to get horribly jealous. </b>
<b>But she didn't admit it. </b>
<b>She loves your brother. </b>
<b>Robert is her man. </b>
<b>The first real one, I think. </b>
<b>But when they make love, </b>
<b>they make it like gays... </b>
<b>and Lysiane despises gays. </b>
<b>You love each other. </b>
<b>You love each other</b>
<b>with your beauty. </b>
<b>I can't break you up. </b>
<b>You'll always find</b>
<b>your way back to each other. </b>
<b>You love your brother</b>
<b>more than me. </b>
<b>No way can I get around that. </b>
<b>That's the kind of misery... </b>
<b>that can only happen</b>
<b>to a woman my age. </b>
<b>I always remained indifferent... </b>
<b>to the desires</b>
<b>the others showed me... </b>
<b>but my mental chastity... </b>
<b>has built a field inside of me... </b>
<b>a field that can be easily sown... </b>
<b>with the seeds of the miraculous. </b>
<b>Having seen her that first day... </b>
<b>Querelle no longer thought</b>
<b>of looking at Lysiane. </b>
<b>But bit by bit, </b>
<b>with her usual authority... </b>
<b>she imposed herself upon him</b>
<b>and took possession of him. </b>
<b>Neither my brother nor I</b>
<b>is sufficiently in love with love... </b>
<b>to seek new experiences. </b>
<b>Nor do we need to satisfy</b>
<b>some hygienic urge. </b>
<b>Nono sees in his game</b>
<b>with Querelle an energetic... </b>
<b>somewhat boastful manifestation</b>
<b>of a horniness... </b>
<b>which he believes to have</b>
<b>discovered in Querelle. </b>
<b>There's nothing more to it than there</b>
<b>would be to an orgy in a monastery: </b>
<b>a bit of pleasant fun</b>
<b>in which Nono is also indulging... </b>
<b>because of his powerful shoulders. </b>
<b>I know I'm risking nothing... </b>
<b>because absolutely no emotion</b>
<b>clouds the purity of my game. </b>
<b>No passion. </b>
<b>It's a game without weight. </b>
<b>Two men having the time of their lives</b>
<b>by virtue of one of them... </b>
<b>without complication, </b>
<b>offering the other his ass. </b>
<b>Nono agreed to fuck Querelle</b>
<b>more or less to be nice. </b>
<b>It doesn't seem to him that</b>
<b>the sailor was in love with him... </b>
<b>but he needed that</b>
<b>to continue living. </b>
<b>Because of Querelle's strength, </b>
<b>Nono did not feel contempt for him. </b>
<b>You like fucking me, don't you? </b>
<b>Why not? It isn't bad. </b>
<b>If I were to say I felt for you, </b>
<b>that would be a lie. </b>
<b>I've never understood how anybody</b>
<b>could fall in love with a man. </b>
<b>I could never fall</b>
<b>in love with a guy. </b>
<b>I let myself get fucked</b>
<b>'cause I like it. </b>
<b>- Have you tried to fuck a guy? </b>
<b>- Never. </b>
<b>Not the least bit interested either. </b>
<b>But you don't mind</b>
<b>other guys fucking you? </b>
<b>Why not? </b>
<b>Like I said, </b>
<b>it's just for the fun of it. </b>
<b>Nono doesn't love me... </b>
<b>but I feel more and more</b>
<b>that something new is happening. </b>
<b>A feeling binds me to Nono. </b>
<b>I would never admit that Nono</b>
<b>dominates me just because he fucks me. </b>
<b>But you can't keep</b>
<b>playing the same game every day... </b>
<b>without subsequently</b>
<b>giving in to it. </b>
<b>Beyond that, there's Lysiane. </b>
<b>My friendship with you</b>
<b>makes me happy. </b>
<b>For these reasons... </b>
<b>I've lost the desire to continue</b>
<b>playing this game with Nono. </b>
<b>Gil felt a strange emotion when, </b>
<b>for the first time in his life... </b>
<b>Gil felt a strange emotion when, </b>
<b>for the first time in his life... </b>
<b>he saw his name in the headlines. </b>
<b>It was on the front page. </b>
<b>At first he thought</b>
<b>the story was about someone else... </b>
<b>and at the same time</b>
<b>about himself alone. </b>
<b>Nevertheless, </b>
<b>the judges will realize... </b>
<b>Realize what? </b>
<b>What judges? </b>
<b>You're not thinking</b>
<b>of giving yourself up now? </b>
<b>That would be really idiotic. </b>
<b>You've been hiding out too long</b>
<b>for them not to believe you're guilty. </b>
<b>His name exposed him, </b>
<b>and exposed him completely naked. </b>
<b>This was glory... </b>
<b>terrible to be ashamed of it... </b>
<b>of entering it</b>
<b>through the door of contempt. </b>
<b>What have you got to lose? </b>
<b>If you steal something now, </b>
<b>it won't even go on your record. </b>
<b>What's a robbery next to a murder? </b>
<b>There isn't much a sailor</b>
<b>like me can do, but I've done it. </b>
<b>I looked for a likely safe place... </b>
<b>and I've found one. </b>
<b>Really? </b>
<b>If you had money... </b>
<b>you could buy some different clothes</b>
<b>and get out of here safely. </b>
<b>What's the plan? </b>
<b>My lieutenant has</b>
<b>an appointment today. </b>
<b>He always has</b>
<b>lots of cash on him. </b>
<b>And how's this</b>
<b>supposed to come out? </b>
<b>Easy. </b>
<b>Easy? </b>
<b>On his way, he'll pass</b>
<b>a pissoir he always uses. </b>
<b>He turns on to</b>
<b>the dirty graffiti in there. </b>
<b>Change into these. </b>
<b>No one will ever suspect you. </b>
<b>What if he tries to fight me off? </b>
<b>I mean... </b>
<b>He never fights. </b>
<b>He's too chicken for that. </b>
<b>He's just a big queen. </b>
<b>What if he does fight? </b>
<b>I thought of that. </b>
<b>You have to think of everything. </b>
<b>That's why I brought this. </b>
<b>A gun? </b>
<b>Only if push comes to shove. </b>
<b>You won't need it. </b>
<b>I'm sure of that. </b>
<b>That suit looks perfect on you. </b>
<b>You think so? </b>
<b>If I say so. </b>
<b>I'm gonna give you a mustache. </b>
<b>Perfect. </b>
<b>It's the pissoir between the dock</b>
<b>and the Catholic church. </b>
<b>Double brandy. </b>
<b>Hands up! </b>
<b>- What's all this about? </b>
<b>- Shut up! </b>
<b>Just hand over your briefcase</b>
<b>or I'll shoot. </b>
<b>I wouldn't do that if I were you. </b>
<b>Shut up and don't move. </b>
<b>Give me your cash</b>
<b>or I'll blow a hole in your guts. </b>
<b>Go ahead. Shoot. </b>
<b>Come on. Shoot! </b>
<b>Come on! </b>
<b>Okay? </b>
<b>Almost. </b>
<b>Almost? </b>
<b>What's that supposed to mean? </b>
<b>He didn't want</b>
<b>to hand over the cash. </b>
<b>I had to shoot! </b>
<b>And is he... </b>
<b>Just wounded him. </b>
<b>Hit him in the shoulder. </b>
<b>How much cash did he have? </b>
<b>Fifty thousand. </b>
<b>I threw the briefcase in the sea. </b>
<b>That's good. </b>
<b>That's very good. </b>
<b>And now? </b>
<b>I bought you a ticket to Bordeaux. </b>
<b>For when? </b>
<b>Today. 4:20.</b>
<b>Already? Today? </b>
<b>Every second you stay in Brest</b>
<b>is dangerous. </b>
<b>Now you've got money. </b>
<b>You can take care of yourself. </b>
<b>Fifty thousand ought</b>
<b>to do you for a while. </b>
<b>I'm so lucky</b>
<b>you helped me out, Querelle. </b>
<b>- You know? </b>
<b>- Forget it. </b>
<b>You still gotta be careful</b>
<b>they don't catch you. </b>
<b>Can I trust you to keep your trap shut</b>
<b>if you do get nabbed? </b>
<b>Sure you can. </b>
<b>The cops will never get</b>
<b>anything out of me. </b>
<b>I never even heard of you. </b>
<b>Well, I better leave now. </b>
<b>Yeah, I guess you better. </b>
<b>Sorry about this, old buddy. </b>
<b>Really. </b>
<b>- I liked you. </b>
<b>- I like you too. </b>
<b>But we'll meet again. </b>
<b>I'll never forget you. </b>
<b>You say that now. </b>
<b>Life happens fast. </b>
<b>You've already forgotten me. </b>
<b>No way, pal. </b>
<b>Not at all. </b>
<b>I'm not that kind of guy. </b>
<b>Really? </b>
<b>You won't forget me? </b>
<b>If I say I won't, </b>
<b>you know I won't. </b>
<b>Funny what good friends</b>
<b>we've become. </b>
<b>We were friends</b>
<b>right from the start. </b>
<b>I hope nothing happens to you. </b>
<b>Querelle's friendship for Gil</b>
<b>developed to the brink of love. </b>
<b>Like himself, Gil had killed. </b>
<b>He was a little Querelle</b>
<b>for whom Querelle maintained... </b>
<b>a strange feeling</b>
<b>of respect and curiosity. </b>
<b>As though he was standing before</b>
<b>the fetus of a baby Querelle. </b>
<b>He wanted to make love to him... </b>
<b>because he believed his tenderness</b>
<b>would be strengthened by it. </b>
<b>Because he would be</b>
<b>more closely linked to Gil... </b>
<b>whom he would then link</b>
<b>more closely to himself. </b>
<b>But he didn't know</b>
<b>how to go about it... </b>
<b>since he, having always been fucked, </b>
<b>didn't know how to fuck a guy. </b>
<b>A gesture</b>
<b>would have embarrassed him. </b>
<b>- You're sweet, you know that? </b>
<b>- Why? </b>
<b>You let me kiss you like this</b>
<b>without complaining about it. </b>
<b>Why should I? </b>
<b>I told you you are my friend. </b>
<b>- This isn't bothering you, is it? </b>
<b>- No. </b>
<b>You've got to be</b>
<b>my very special friend forever. </b>
<b>- Do you understand? </b>
<b>- Yes. </b>
<b>- And will you? </b>
<b>- Yes. </b>
<b>In some obscure way... </b>
<b>Querelle understood</b>
<b>that love is voluntary. </b>
<b>You have to want it. </b>
<b>When you don't love men... </b>
<b>letting yourself get fucked</b>
<b>can give you pleasure... </b>
<b>but to fuck men, </b>
<b>you have to love them... </b>
<b>even if only</b>
<b>at the moment you're fucking. </b>
<b>So if he was to love Gil, </b>
<b>he would have to give up his passivity. </b>
<b>Querelle tried. </b>
<b>My friend. </b>
<b>What a shame we can't</b>
<b>stay together forever. </b>
<b>But we'll meet again. </b>
<b>To be together like here... </b>
<b>I'd like that. </b>
<b>The vision of the solitude</b>
<b>in which their love had developed... </b>
<b>increased his love for Gil. </b>
<b>And he felt to be</b>
<b>everything for him... </b>
<b>his one friend, his one family. </b>
<b>I never loved a boy before. </b>
<b>- You're the first one. </b>
<b>- Truly? </b>
<b>Truly. </b>
<b>Gil had finally resigned himself</b>
<b>to the other crime. </b>
<b>Little by little, he assumed</b>
<b>responsibility for the sailor's murder. </b>
<b>Hi. </b>
<b>You want something from me? </b>
<b>Depends. </b>
<b>On what? </b>
<b>On you. </b>
<b>I've got a tip for Mario. </b>
<b>But you've got to promise me you won't</b>
<b>tell anybody where it came from. </b>
<b>Nobody. </b>
<b>Never. </b>
<b>Is that clear? </b>
<b>I promise you. </b>
<b>That's all I can say. </b>
<b>That'll do. </b>
<b>You can tell Mario... </b>
<b>that this Polack... </b>
<b>this Gil Turko... </b>
<b>will be on the train</b>
<b>that leaves for Bordeaux at 4:20.</b>
<b>Ciao. </b>
<b>But loved by Querelle... </b>
<b>I would be loved</b>
<b>by every sailor in France... </b>
<b>because Querelle is a compendium of all</b>
<b>their masculine and naive virtues. </b>
<b>If I desire authority... </b>
<b>this admirable form</b>
<b>which evokes love and fear... </b>
<b>then I must awaken</b>
<b>a feeling for this authority... </b>
<b>in the heart of the sailors. </b>
<b>They ought to love me. </b>
<b>I want to be their father</b>
<b>and injure them. </b>
<b>I shall mark them. </b>
<b>They will hate me. </b>
<b>In the face of their misery</b>
<b>I shall remain unmoved. </b>
<b>More and more, the feeling</b>
<b>of perfect power will fill my being. </b>
<b>Having conquered my compassion, </b>
<b>I shall be strong... </b>
<b>and sad, when I regard</b>
<b>my pathetic disguise. </b>
<b>I know that I will</b>
<b>never leave Querelle. </b>
<b>My whole life will be</b>
<b>dedicated to him. </b>
<b>Good morning. </b>
<b>When I suffer, </b>
<b>I can not believe in God. </b>
<b>In pain, </b>
<b>all I can count on is myself... </b>
<b>in the misfortune for which</b>
<b>I have someone else to thank. </b>
<b>I always knew</b>
<b>you were a murderer! </b>
<b>Come on! Stab me! </b>
<b>We haveJesus to thank</b>
<b>that we are able to glorify humility... </b>
<b>for He made it</b>
<b>the sign of the divine. </b>
<b>The godhead in our</b>
<b>innermost depths... </b>
<b>For why should we renounce</b>
<b>the violence of this world? </b>
<b>If this Godhead</b>
<b>is to confront violence... </b>
<b>then it must be strong</b>
<b>if it is to achieve the victory. </b>
<b>And humility can only</b>
<b>be born of humiliation. </b>
<b>Otherwise it is nothing</b>
<b>but vanity. </b>
<b>Put away your knife. </b>
<b>- Good morning, Lieutenant. </b>
<b>- Good morning. What can I do for you? </b>
<b>Would you be good enough</b>
<b>to come with me to the police station? </b>
<b>Certainly. </b>
<b>For what reason? </b>
<b>I want you to look at a suspect. </b>
<b>It concerns the robbery. </b>
<b>- You have a suspect then, do you? </b>
<b>- We have. </b>
<b>Is that a fact? </b>
<b>Then I'll be glad</b>
<b>to come along with you. </b>
<b>Let's go. </b>
<b>Querelle was now Lysiane's lover. </b>
<b>The excitement she felt thinking about</b>
<b>the identity of the two brothers... </b>
<b>exasperated her</b>
<b>to such a degree that she felt lost. </b>
<b>What did you hope to achieve... </b>
<b>by attacking</b>
<b>your fellow worker Theo Celine? </b>
<b>- I wanted to kill him. </b>
<b>- You did? </b>
<b>So you already thought of killing him</b>
<b>when you broke the bottle... </b>
<b>with which</b>
<b>you mortally wounded him? </b>
<b>Yes, I wanted to kill him. </b>
<b>So, before you hit him, it was clear</b>
<b>that you might kill him with the bottle? </b>
<b>Absolutely, Inspector. </b>
<b>I wanted to kill him. </b>
<b>Why did you want to do that? </b>
<b>He hurt my honor and my soul. </b>
<b>How did he do that? </b>
<b>He made fun of me</b>
<b>in front of everybody... </b>
<b>including myself. </b>
<b>And that was reason enough</b>
<b>for you to kill a man? </b>
<b>Can one man do</b>
<b>anything worse to another... </b>
<b>than hurting his honor? </b>
<b>Well... </b>
<b>I suppose there are some differences</b>
<b>of opinion on that subject. </b>
<b>I repeat once again: </b>
<b>you killed the sailor Vic Rivette</b>
<b>to rob him of his money... </b>
<b>and you killed Theo Celine</b>
<b>because he hurt your honor. </b>
<b>Is that correct? </b>
<b>Yes. </b>
<b>That's correct. </b>
<b>And the robbery</b>
<b>of Naval Lieutenant Seblon? </b>
<b>It's exactly as I told you. </b>
<b>I had nothing to do with that one. </b>
<b>You're sticking</b>
<b>to your story on that. Fine. </b>
<b>- Marcellin? </b>
<b>- Yes, Inspector. </b>
<b>Well, Lieutenant, here he is. </b>
<b>Do you recognize him? </b>
<b>You, take off your hat. </b>
<b>And get up. </b>
<b>No, it's not him. </b>
<b>I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I must ask you</b>
<b>to think this one over very carefully. </b>
<b>Maybe you do remember</b>
<b>this young man. </b>
<b>I don't understand</b>
<b>what you're getting at. </b>
<b>I'm concerned with justice too. </b>
<b>I can't accuse an innocent man. </b>
<b>Are you absolutely certain? </b>
<b>Absolutely. </b>
<b>I would have recognized him right away</b>
<b>because his face was right next to mine. </b>
<b>Lieutenant, you may go now. </b>
<b>You haven't even</b>
<b>got a decent hard-on. </b>
<b>It doesn't stay up forever. </b>
<b>Buy yourself a rubber one. </b>
<b>You know... </b>
<b>I've dreamt a lot</b>
<b>about your prick lately. </b>
<b>Yeah? </b>
<b>Was it nicer in your dreams? </b>
<b>No. </b>
<b>I'm very satisfied. </b>
<b>You have a solid, heavy, </b>
<b>massive prick. </b>
<b>Not elegant, but strong. </b>
<b>And so different from Robert's. </b>
<b>Different how? </b>
<b>Your prick has more character. </b>
<b>Why did you refuse me for so long? </b>
<b>I didn't refuse you. </b>
<b>It's just that you were</b>
<b>my brother's woman. </b>
<b>And now? </b>
<b>Now I'm getting revenge</b>
<b>on my brother. </b>
<b>So... </b>
<b>that's the reason. </b>
<b>And me? </b>
<b>And me? </b>
<b>You? </b>
<b>You're just a woman. </b>
<b>Each man kills the thing he loves</b>
<b>Some do it with a bitter look</b>
<b>Some with a flattering word</b>
<b>The coward does it with a kiss</b>
<b>Careful, Querelle! </b>
<b>If you lose your footing, </b>
<b>you can sometimes fall very far. </b>
<b>Thanks, Inspector. </b>
<b>How about it? </b>
<b>Throw dice with me? </b>
<b>No. </b>
<b>I'll never throw dice</b>
<b>with you again. </b>
<b>Give me a double scotch. </b>
<b>They even have to get drunk</b>
<b>on the same day. </b>
<b>The "Holy Brothers."</b>
<b>I said a double. </b>
<b>Some kill their love</b>
<b>when they are young</b>
<b>And some when they are old</b>
<b>Some strangle with the hands of lust</b>
<b>Some with the hands of gold</b>
<b>Where are you going? </b>
<b>That's nobody's business. </b>
<b>Do you hear me? </b>
<b>Hey, you wanna get fucked? </b>
<b>Come on, baby. </b>
<b>You wanna get fucked by me? </b>
<b>There. </b>
<b>- Motherfucker! </b>
<b>- Hitting a defenseless girl. </b>
<b>If you were a real man... </b>
<b>Watch out, guys, he's got a knife. </b>
<b>Don't be crazy. </b>
<b>This is pure madness. </b>
<b>I don't want you to get involved</b>
<b>in this kind of business. </b>
<b>Put away your knife. </b>
<b>Come on. </b>
<b>Come with me. </b>
<b>You're a pal. </b>
<b>All the others are assholes, </b>
<b>but you're a pal. </b>
<b>Whatever you want from me, </b>
<b>it's yours. </b>
<b>Be quiet. If an officer</b>
<b>were to come along... </b>
<b>I don't give a fuck! </b>
<b>As far as I'm concerned, </b>
<b>you're all there is. </b>
<b>Stop yelling! </b>
<b>You're going to wind up</b>
<b>in the brig! </b>
<b>I'd be very sad</b>
<b>if you went to prison. </b>
<b>Really? </b>
<b>You're just saying that. </b>
<b>You're an officer. </b>
<b>What do you care? </b>
<b>You know perfectly well</b>
<b>it isn't so. </b>
<b>I'm on the brink of a shame</b>
<b>from which no man ever rises. </b>
<b>But only in that shame</b>
<b>will I find my everlasting peace. </b>
<b>I am so weak. </b>
<b>I've been conquered. </b>
<b>Totally conquered. </b>
<b>And my thoughts are sad. </b>
<b>I have feelings of autumn... </b>
<b>soilings... </b>
<b>fine mortal wounds in me. </b>
<b>I will never find peace</b>
<b>until you take me. </b>
<b>It must be done</b>
<b>so that afterwards... </b>
<b>I can lie across your thighs</b>
<b>like a Pietà... </b>
<b>cradling a dead Jesus. </b>
<b>That's the guy who shot me. </b>
<b>I recognize him. </b>
<b>Querelle, finally! </b>
<b>Why did you keep me</b>
<b>waiting so long? </b>
<b>You want to hurt me? </b>
<b>Destroy me? </b>
<b>My longing for you... </b>
<b>is so strong... </b>
<b>so deep... </b>
<b>endless. </b>
<b>What's all this about? </b>
<b>Why are you crying? </b>
<b>Because you've been longing for me? </b>
<b>Do you know</b>
<b>who you've been longing for? </b>
<b>Your husband's boyfriend. </b>
<b>His piece of ass. </b>
<b>Look at him! Big Nono! </b>
<b>The best stallion that ever existed! </b>
<b>- That can't be true! </b>
<b>- Why shouldn't it be true? </b>
<b>Cut it out, kid. </b>
<b>There's no point in it. </b>
<b>You fucked with Nono... </b>
<b>only because... </b>
<b>you love your brother madly, right? </b>
<b>More and more, Lysiane was</b>
<b>left out of the game. </b>
<b>All that was most beautiful and</b>
<b>most incredible took place without her. </b>
<b>Believe whatever you want. </b>
<b>So, kid, you're nothing more</b>
<b>than a fairy, right? </b>
<b>- What's so funny about it? </b>
<b>- Nothing. </b>
<b>Except that makes</b>
<b>Nono a fairy too! </b>
<b>I think that's pretty funny. </b>
<b>- And Robert? </b>
<b>- What do I care about Robert? </b>
<b>- I'm me! </b>
<b>- You're disgusting! </b>
<b>You're my enemy! </b>
<b>You've destroyed me. </b>
<b>You have mysterious powers. </b>
<b>They multiply infinitely. </b>
<b>You're not a human being. </b>
<b>You don't belong to this earth! </b>
<b>When looking at Querelle, </b>
<b>Lysiane had already lost that feeling... </b>
<b>fencers call</b>
<b>"the fraternity of the sword. "</b>
<b>She was alone. </b>
<b>I know now... </b>
<b>why I feel so abandoned. </b>
<b>Querelle's inner harmony</b>
<b>was indestructible... </b>
<b>because it was sealed</b>
<b>in that heaven of heavens... </b>
<b>where beauty unites with beauty. </b>
<b>What's with you? </b>
<b>I was wrong! </b>
<b>You haven't got a brother. </b>
<b>You understand? </b>
<b>I made a mistake. </b>
<b>Do you hear me? </b>
<b>You haven't got a brother. </b>
<b>He hasn't got a brother at all. </b>
<b>His birth certificate states... </b>
<b>"Born December 19, 1918,</b>
<b>10:00 A.M. </b>
<b>Mother: Gabrielle Genet. </b>
<b>Father: unknown. </b>
<b>Apart from his books, </b>
<b>we know nothing about him. </b>
<b>Not even the date of his death... </b>
<b>which to him seems near. </b>
<b>Jean Genet. "</b>
