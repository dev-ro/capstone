Looking back on my life -
I gotta admit
I've done a lot of idiot things.
MATTI - HELL IS FOR HEROES
My press says that's all I've done
for the past 15 years.
Sometimes I feel that
those stories about me -
have made me
act the way I have.
Only the bad things
make it into the papers -
since I quit my career.
Sometimes I feel like a puppet -
just giving them
the Matti they want.
Yet when they write about me,
I feel I still exist. Sort of.
You get hooked,
even if you don't want to.
The main thing is
that they write.
Still, it always hurts.
I'm not a brick wall.
I've often wondered -
how it feels to be just an
ordinary guy on the street.
If you've had a few too
many and got into a fight, -
it wouldn't make the headlines.
I don't have a clue
what that would be like.
Never had much of normal times.
Is it any better than this?
Never a private day
my whole adult life.
It's all public. Everything.
Even the wedding.
Matti!
It's your turn.
I never wanted to be Joe Average
when I started jumping.
And after the career I had,
there's no going back.
What's gotten into him?
Is he backing out on you?
Last time I was close to
normal, I was a just a kid.
Listen, Matti, -
If I bought you jump skis, would
you have the guts to do it?
I think so.
And then there was no return.
Number one up there,
number one in everything.
I was the fearless clown.
And had to live up to it.
Every time.
He doesn't have the guts.
- I bet you a hundred.
Go, Masa!
What if I break
someone's boat?
No problema!
We'll stop the traffic.
Wait a moment!
If I feel scared, I imagine
myself up in the tower, -
where I fear nothing.
Great, Masa, wait, wait.
Take a photo, and
we'll send it to the papers.
Is it really 30 feet deep?
- More like 6.
The weather's good!
Gold in Engelberg,
gold in Innsbruck...
Fucking hell! He jumped!
Did you get the shot?
It's money, money, money!
- Where is Matti?
Matti is dead. Where is Matti?
Matti has drowned!
C'mon guys! Help me out!
Go help him now.
You didn't drown?
- No, but I lost my shades!
He didn't drown.
- What a tough guy.
The first round is over.
What are your thoughts now?
I always think of getting laid.
But jumping first.
Congratulations, Matti.
Good job.
The rest of you
crashed like dead crows.
In the team event tomorrow,
everyone does the distance.
Is that clear?
Zero tolerance
for alcohol this time.
10 pm curfew.
Warm-up at 8 am.
No special privileges
for anyone! Is that clear?
Right, Jari? - Yes.
Matti? - OK.
And your sex remark
went live in that interview.
Tomorrow, watch your mouth.
I'd rather be up to my neck
in shit than talk to journalists.
That's just where you may
find yourself, one of these days.
Boring. - Yeah.
Where are you off to?
- Evening stroll.
Yeah, sure.
10 pm curfew for everyone.
How come you're up? It's 10. 15.
- Smart-ass.
Until you've been up there
on the podium, you can shut up.
I don't speak any German.
Do you?
Of course.
Hey, girls.
There! I knew it.
I'm going to turn you in.
There they go.
What's a lard-ass like you
got to shout about?
The rules are clear!
- Let's see about the rules.
Let's see!
Let's see! Watch it!
Goddammit
it's three in the morning!
Are you cool if let go?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm OK now.
Hit the sack, everyone. OK Matti?
- Yeah. Clear as glass.
Kale! Open up!
Kale! Open up!
Why did you say I'm gonna
find myself neck-deep in shit?
He'll wear himself
out pretty soon.
He needs a woman
to calm him down.
Press the pause button.
Pause it!
Hello.
Where?
Wait a moment.
Yeah, so it seems.
Thanks for calling.
OK let it run again.
What was it? - The neighbor.
The sauna's on fire.
Whose sauna? - Ours.
Did they call the fire dept? - How
the hell should I know? Rewind!
Take it easy. Just asking.
We can't let this pass.
What state are you in today?
Different from yesterday.
Your antics are going to be
all over the Finnish papers.
What do you have
to say about that?
I think this about
wraps it up for me.
Where are you off to?
- To pack.
Salmela...
How about postponing
the story until our return?
Matti will report
to the Ski Federation.
And fill you in on the details.
OK. It's a deal.
Anything to support
Finnish national prestige abroad.
What do you think, Matti?
- I don't care.
Are you fit to jump?
Don't care either way. You can
let Kojo jump if you feel like it.
They weren't
dumb enough to drop me.
Though Salmela kept his word,
the story hit the papers.
I decided to deny it all.
Matti, what happened there?
- No comment.
I wasn't drinking.
Don't know about the others.
But you've been
summoned to a hearing?
No comment.
That's their business.
I just jump.
Write what you like, -
as long as I jump good.
And I jump great!
What really happened?
- Nothing special.
We are so proud of you.
I hate these receptions.
Why can't I just jump?
Two sides to everything.
You need a ride?
No, Nevalan Nikke will drive me.
So how's the king?
What'll they give you this time?
- I don't know.
You've got a goddam palace.
Coffee machines,
four microwave ovens.
I bet you've even
got a flying carpet.
Why don't they...
Why don't they just give
you cash? You'd be rich.
It's the rules.
And I don't want to go down
that road. Property. That stuff.
You're wound up too tight.
You need a drink.
No time.
- There's always time.
They're waiting for me.
- That's the fucking point.
What is 15 minutes?
And they are dancing to your
tune! You call the shots.
Yeah...
Maybe a quick one then.
- You're getting the idea.
Every time
I slide down and jump, -
I get a strange
feeling of bon voyage, -
as if I have lived it before.
Hell! I get that when I wake up
in jail with shit in my pants.
I've been looking
for you all over town.
They're waiting
for you at City Hall.
You have exactly one minute.
And then I'm gone.
Good thing he went.
I'd have flattened the bastard.
Stop! Stop!
Damn it... You really
are a cunning fox.
Clean yourself up a bit.
The mayor doesn't realize
you've been missing.
He thinks this
is part of the program.
You arrive
there later like dessert.
That's the story
and you stick to it.
How about the Ski Federation?
- All taken care of.
Maybe you're not such
a cunning fox after all.
At least not all the time.
Sign this for Antti.
Who is Antti?
- He's my nephew.
Soon to be ten years old.
You're his greatest hero.
His continual successes challenge
us to show our appreciation.
Along with this 30 000 marks -
we wanted to give
him something lasting
But what would that be?
We looked into the future and
knew what Matti was missing.
You didn't get me
a woman, did you?
Joke!
I have the honour and pleasure
as the City Mayor to announce -
that from this day on,
you are on the City's payroll.
The City has appointed you,
Matti, to be assistant caretaker -
of the sports arenas!
Congratulations, Matti!
Yes, well, well, well...
Thanks everyone.
The City.
The car company for the
new car you sponsor.
Sorry you had to start
without me.
I would have come earlier,
but Coach forgot to pick me up.
It's understandable.
Uh... Thanks.
Matti, you're our champion.
Our Matti.
There's our Matti.
Matti is our champ.
... assistant caretaker of...
Listen, Matti...
Matti, Matti, Matti...
... assistant caretaker of...
Watch out for his head.
Not a word in the papers.
I'll see to that.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Maybe they should write it up.
Maybe he'd learn something.
What d'you mean?
He's the City's top hero.
He deserves a celebration.
Matti has jumped this
village onto the global map.
That's good PR.
And that means money.
You sound like
the Ski Fed big shots.
They don't care about him,
either.
It's money they want.
Fat crowds.
He makes so
much money for the Fed -
that it makes them
deaf and blind to the truth.
What truth?
Who's the best ski-jumper
in the world? - You are.
Yeah. Not some
assistant caretaker.
Matti... Matti...
What are you
going to do after this?
Ski-jump.
That's what you do now. But
how about in ten years time?
I'll be an ex-ski-jumper.
What are you interested in?
Ski-jumping.
What else? - Nothing.
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.
Being an athlete is a 24/7 job.
I can't afford this, with the
Olympics just around the corner.
I'm really sorry about the work
injury. But we have new plans.
What if we
make you City's PR man?
Are you saying -
that I have to carry
speakers and stuff around?
That will mess up my jumping.
You got it all wrong.
Matti, you're
now the City's PR man.
Can you tell us what it means?
From now on,
I look after its image.
Public reactions, you know.
Advertising, cocktail parties.
That kind of thing.
Why are you
the man for the job?
I have enough
charisma for this too.
About ski jumping...
Everyone knows that you are in
the league of your own. - Yes.
So much better than
anyone else. - Yes.
Do you ever
feel fear up in the tower?
Cowards can't jump.
You're alone up there,
so it's all up yours.
You're on your way to -
the national
team's training camp, -
with your arm in a cast?
Just let me get my skis on.
It only takes a week
to get into top shape.
A feeling of relaxation -
is taking over your whole
body and your mind.
All your muscles are loose.
You're breathing easy.
You feel nice and warm.
Now I'll count down from 10 to 1.
And on 1,
you will all go to sleep.
Ten, nine...
Six, five.
Once again, Matti
ruins the session for all.
This is dumb.
And no good for jumping.
Let me do something
that makes sense.
What makes sense, is you
making use of that door.
Fine with me.
Hi there, champ.
- How come you're here?
I'm just hanging out.
- What are you up to here?
I missed you. Haven't
seen you for two weeks.
The City misses the royal touch.
The Matti way.
Kiss my ass! - Good.
Let's go. - What?
Let's take your car.
Mine's out of gas.
No way.
I can't quit the camp.
I'm taking you to a real camp.
No way I can go.
Well, if you
don't have the guts.
Will ya fuckin' hear how quiet
it is! Wasn't this a good idea?
This is your Empire.
This is the life.
Great!
We'll camp here.
Let's spend the night
here, like scouts.
Not enough glassware.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
This isn't the only one.
I'm not sure.
Being sure is my job.
I'm your best mate.
Now and always.
I want to be a forest boy...
Shut up! - Can't
remember the lyrics.
Fuck the lyrics.
You ain't a singer.
And you never will be.
Just jump! - Yes.
I feel like shit.
Fuck! Stop!
- What, what?
Stop, stop!
- Don't puke in the car!
Coupla lookers!
Dazzling weather.
What's up with the babes?
Waiting for the bus.
- No kidding?
I'd never have guessed.
Where you going?
- Kuopio
To Kuopio?
What do people
do there in summer?
You were lucky.
We're heading that way too.
We need a cake.
Wanna save your
pennies and hitch a ride?
You're going the wrong way.
- Kuopio is that way.
No shit!
Looks like Matti
has lost his way then.
Is that really Matti? THE Matti?
Read what is says on the door.
The champ himself.
Wanna show us the way?
Nikke!
- Wait a sec, babes.
Kuopio is hundreds
of kilometers away!
I gotta head back to camp.
Damn it! - Damn it, damn it!
Blah, blah, blah.
Loosen up.
Look at them. Which you want?
Mine is the one in funny pants.
Climb on in babes!
Is that Taina always
so quiet? - Not always.
How about Matti?
Only when he's sober.
I thought athletes don't drink.
That's a good one.
Really good.
I'm getting tipsy.
- That's good.
That's really good.
Hey, that's far enough. Stop.
You're not tipsy enough. Yet.
You both live here?
We're neighbors.
Thanks for the ride.
Should I give you my
number? - Why?
So you could call me sometime.
- Why would I?
I'm not impressed. - Right.
Ski-jumping's for morons.
Boring.
Kati! Come on!
What does she
see in the old fart?
Can I get your number?
- Why?
So I can call you sometime.
Way to go. - What was that?
Kati's phone number.
- Why did you chuck it away?
I've already had all I want.
But you got nothin' out of Taina.
I got her phone number!
- Crap!
You are so
hopeless with women.
Have you ever done it sober?
I bet you haven't.
Don't sulk! Have a swig!
- No. I'm driving.
We have a long way to go.
- It won't even hit you by then.
But you don't have the guts.
You are chickenshit.
Juice is what I like,
it's always on my mind
Taina is different from
all the others. - Really?
You saw it too?
- Sure as hell did.
Sticks out a mile.
Crossed eyes, lousy tits!
What this? A lottery ticket?
- Don't take it. Don't!
Dear Taina, I miss you.
Damn, damn! Stop it!
Damn, damn. I wasn't
going to throw it out.
Take little more.
I was just kidding.
Nice parking, eh? Even I
must be close to the 0.5 limit.
That much you can have.
You're a real mate.
Quit the gay stuff. I'm starving.
You got any food? - No.
Can you get any food around
here? - The canteen is closed.
So? We open it.
Hell, no, I'd get into trouble.
- No, you won't.
I'll take full responsibility.
Will you? - Sure!
Any extras on the Breakfast of
Champions? - Give me the lot!
Coming up.
Way to go. - I have a feeling
that I'm gonna hear about this.
You haven't even been here.
They'll think
it's just a gang of kids.
Don't drop them.
This is not a good idea.
- Sure it is.
The perfect crime.
Time to hit the sack. We'll figure
out your alibi in the morning.
What the hell you been
doing, Matti?- What?
And a chick as well! Overnight
guests are not allowed here!
Help!
Stupid move. Hope it doesn't
hit the press. - It won't.
Nikke knew better again.
I paid both our fines coz
he was broke, as always.
And I took the
rap for the driving, too.
He shut up in court.
Scared.
I have never jumped
under the influence.
Nor driven a vehicle.
These are facts.
No comment.
- Did you learn anything?
Yeah, if I gotta go to court
which I never will again, -
and if something is sure,
it's really sure, -
and I will have a lawyer and
I recommend it to everyone.
Hei, Matti...
How about the DUI charge?
I have never jumped under
the influence. Nor driven.
When I drink a little,
things happen.
When I drink a little,
things happen.
I guess it's that
famous other man.
Mirva's the first woman who
doesn't kick up a stink if I relax.
On the contrary.
She's just the same herself.
Before her, I was too
eager to please the babes.
Did everything backwards.
With all of them:
Jaana, Riitta, Lissu, -
Katariina, Eeva.
And Taina, of course.
I'm on my way to Helsinki.
On business.
So am I.
- I've got a job interview.
I mean to Helsinki.
I'll give you a ride.
I'm not sure if I dare.
- Why?
We read the papers
also here in Kuopio.
Shame you didn't get the job.
- Work in a sausage factory?
I'd like to be a model. - Yeah.
Uh, I've been thinking
of staying on here.
Bit of a holiday. Y'know?
Nice. So I have
to take the train back?
I meant that...
We could uh...
...start to... Damn, damn.
- Why not?
But don't think
this is something serious.
Of course not.
I decided to impress Taina
by painting the town red.
Bingo!
I've always
been a man of action.
Hi!
I'm back!
Taina!
Are you ill? - No.
I've been a week in camp.
Didn't you remember I was
due back today? - Yes.
And also that you're off
again in the morning.
What is this?
You done my laundry?
You listening? The coach
is picking me up at six.
You-you-you-you!
And your fucking ski-jumping!
And your sweaty ski-pants!
Cook! Shop!
Clean up round here!
You need a servant, not me!
Where did
this house come from?
Have you thought about it?
From my jumping!
It's not too much to
ask you to take care of it.
It's Olympic year!
Fuck you and your Olympics!
You only care about yourself.
You have never asked
what I'm interested in!
I spend every
free second with you!
I don't even see
my mates any more!
I spend all
my spare time with you.
Always you.
You should hear yourself!
- People expect a lot from me!
"People expect a lot from me!"
You think the world
revolves around your jumps!
I hope you don't win!
Ever again!
You're supposed
to leave in two hours!
Did you hear me?
You have to leave!
If you don't quit nagging,
it ain't me who's leaving!
Let's see who is leaving!
You don't nag anymore!
Who bought the house?
Shut your goddam mouth!
Good morning.
Help! Coach? Let's go.
They insist that you go.
I'm coming with you.
They pay everything.
We're leaving in two hours.
I can't go. I'm so tired of this.
You have to go, Matti.
What in hell happened here?
Don't you remember?
I didn't do
anything to you, did I?
You don't
remember that either?
Could you hit a woman?
You're paranoid!
You're paranoid!
You're ready for the funny
farm! Old people's home!
I saw you giving
that bitch the eye!
Quit the goddamn nagging!
I don't listen to that
nonsense anymore!
You don't tell me what I do!
This is my house!
We'll see about that.
Crazy woman!
Matti. Did you hear me?
Could you hit a woman?
I don't...
Someone will pick you up.
You are there tonight.
Who's the little guy?
- Antti, my kid.
He had to come when he
heard who the passenger was.
So you are Antti.
Do you want to jump too?
- I dunno.
Do you have the guts
if I get you a pair of skis?
Never thought about it.
Come and try it sometimes.
Antti plays ice hockey. - That
makes more sense than jumping.
I need a beer.
I'm scared of flying.
I've never been on a plane.
Maybe we can have one.
The Four Hills Tournament
1987-88
Goddammit. I don't believe this.
Goddammit!
This is the limit.
The honchos at the Ski Fed
should try this just once.
Where's your sense of humor?
Skis up and let's go.
You do have your skis,
don't you?
Take them away.
They are from Yugoslavia.
No way I'll jump with
that Eastern bloc trash.
I want Kneissl. - They don't
even make them any more.
The only place to get them
at night is a museum.
Me and Taina decided that
we want a better hotel.
This has been OK before.
That was then.
These days, I have
bad memories about this place.
Besides, they don't even
have a pinball machine.
They see us... Pervert!
If he doesn't leave, we will.
This is a majority decision.
I agree with them.
Matti's not a team player.
He doesn't give a shit.
I don't have
the authority to do that.
I can call Finland.
Let them decide. Their show.
You wanted to talk. So do I.
First: where are my Kneissl skis?
Second: we don't travel
in the bus anymore.
Third: we need a taxi.
We'll follow the bus.
Send the taxi bills
straight to the Fed.
Those guys are over
her like rats over cheese.
She's my wife not the team's.
- Listen up!
You and Taina are flying
back to Helsinki. Tonight.
It's decided.
This is the biggest
mistake of your life!
Was this the Coach's decision?
- We've broken contact.
Draw your own conclusions.
Does this interfere
with the Olympics?
We'll see
after our honeymoon.
Where are you
going for it? Taina?
We'll hold a separate
press conference.
Thank you, Matti.
I never thought that the
comment about Coach -
could get so distorted.
I wasn't man enough
to stop the avalanche.
I was afraid that people
would start hating me.
And I was out of the Olympics.
I am worried about
his post-career life.
You think his career is over?
He's not in the team now.
But it doesn't mean
he won't be in the future.
You have
received death threats?
Yes. And not only I,
and that's the worst thing, -
my family has also received them.
- Just take care of yourself!
My family has nothing
to do with the choices -
I make in my profession.
I hope the message
gets through now.
Should you come clean about
what happened and apologize?
He's got what he deserves.
Guess what? - What?
Guess! - What?
There'll be three of us
next summer. - Who?
Us. - Who us?
Well, us-us.
Are you pregnant?
- Second month.
You sure it's mine?
Are you? - Yes.
Mineral water, please.
- This is purely our time out.
No alcohol. - Not a drop.
If something's certain, this is it.
Have a wonderful honeymoon.
This bastard was drunk all week.
What? What?
Get the fuck up!
During our honeymoon,
everyone was shouting:
"Matti for the games!"
"The Coach for the sack!"
I had nothing against it
so I just fuelled the fire!
Was this beach holiday well timed,
considering the Olympics?
We didn't hang out in pool bars.
I was working out all the time.
Ask Taina.
But you are out of the games.
I don't care what colours I wear.
It can be orange or yellow.
If Finland doesn't want me, -
I'll move to Copenhagen
and represent Sweden.
Next day I got
a public apology -
and a nomination
to the Olympic team.
I only had one answer to that.
Everyone knew it was
a good move to send me.
Those medals I dedicated
to the people of Finland.
Not the Ski Federation.
Good thing the games
were then, not a year later.
Matti! Matti! Matti!
The circus started at the airport.
No one could deal with it sober.
You have three PR sessions
today. First, City Hall in an hour.
I'm tired. I need to rest.
Tell them I'll be there tomorrow.
The meetings are today!
You can't back out!
You have to do your PR!
You have to think about
the future of this family.
That's what I said. Tomorrow
is future. - Yeah, right.
You smell of booze again!
I don't go to church after a gig!
Grow up!
I'll have 2 kids to look after!
Have you taken
care of the fan mail?
I was getting fed up
with everything. Even her.
She'd sat down to a full table
and was eating all the food.
I had lost the most important
thing in life. Freedom.
Long time, no see.
Just a few postcards to show
where you've been.
So many damn cat christenings -
and dog funerals
there's been no time to stop.
Rosberg has lined
up so much PR work, -
it's lucky I have
time to brush my teeth.
I only jump in my
dreams, damn it all!
Calm down.
You're tight as a wire.
Keke takes every time 40%, -
so does the taxman.
Taina takes the rest.
Work out for yourself
what's left for me.
How much? - No more
than seven to six hundred.
This is your
once-in-a-lifetime chance -
to get off the tread mill.
Quit the PR bullshit now.
And get a new manager
who listens to you.
You're no, uh, machine.
You got the feelings of an artist.
Am I right?
And I got just the guy:
Nick Nevada!
No foreigners.
I don't speak English.
No, no! It's me!
Same guy but with the hair.
Nick - Niilo,
Nevada - Nevala.
Different name
but the hair is the same.
But first things first!
Yeah? And what's first?
- Rest and recreation!
First the manager calls a taxi.
First you empty your bank account
and from then on, -
the manager takes care
of everything for you.
Then a taxi to Helsinki.
I know exactly what you need.
- What's that?
Pussy, food and a bed.
Drop out of sight for two
weeks, isn't that right?
Yes, that is the meaning.
Champ here
needs a real vacation.
And money we have as
much as King Kong has hair.
We can stash this in your safe.
How does the
young wife feel about this?
It is so that in our marriage
we lift potatoes in spring -
when others do it in autumn.
I'll be damned... There's
a studio upstairs you can use.
Pussy is up to you,
I'm no pimp.
I just run a girlie bar.
- Got it. Understood. Thanks.
What did I say.
What did I say.
Nice looking cat!
You wanna stroke her?
- She wouldn't let me.
Leave it to Manager.
Girls out!
Boys into the office!
Ah, shit! - No.
Girls, hold on...
It's better that Matti isn't here.
So it doesn't leak out.
How did you
know about the raid?
Aren't they supposed
to come as a surprise?
This line of work,
I can't afford surprises.
You gotta be awake 24/7.
Or you're out of business.
- Same in ski-jumping.
It's been a pleasure.
Welcome back, any time.
We'll take the money bag now.
Right. Bags are the
real measure of a man.
What's this?
Here's your invoice, in detail.
Full board, times two.
You've billed for the company.
First time
I've paid for getting laid.
There's always a first time.
Good looks
don't mean freebies!
This means trouble!
- Yeah!
And here you
get trouble for free!
This is what I thought.
Fuck,
I've sprained something!
Just like that!
- You said he's your mate.
Business is business.
And anyway,
he did give us a discount.
You're a hell of a manager.
- Hey, come on...
But it was a nice
holiday, wasn't it?
Masa, Masa, don't!
I worried about how Taina
would take my two-week bender.
I had missed her, after all. A bit.
Taina?
Haven't you
checked the fan mail?
Congratulations, asshole!
While you were God-knows-
where, you became a father.
Now you got a son named
Mika, but no more wife.
Is that the best name
she could come up with?
Mika?
That's Kojo's first name!
Taina! Taina!
Taina! Taina!
Get the hell out
or I'll call the police.
The door's locked!
Come home. - This is
mine and Mika's home now.
I want to see the baby!
Throw down the key!
Here you are, shithead.
- Thanks, honey!
Taina! It's the wrong key!
- I never said it fits this door.
What the hell is this?
- And there's your fan mail!
"Hey, Matti.
Do you remember me?"
"We had such a lovely
time together in Vaasa. "
"That pub restroom
was really hot. "
"It was so beautiful
when I sat on your lap. "
"I've missed you ever since. "
"That was true
love with no regrets. "
"Here's my key. "
"You're welcome
here anytime, darling. "
"Yours, Melinda. "
Of course, we didn't have
a pre-nup agreement.
The house went with the wife.
I was left with the medals.
It makes you wonder.
I thought about being
a marriage counselor.
Get Matti round to mess up
your marriage in just 7 seconds.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
What are you going
to do now?- Nothing.
Material things are just stuff,
as far as I'm concerned.
I just need a new place to
keep my Olympic dingle-dangle.
We've kept it exactly as it was.
Maybe I swap the curtains
for something more porno.
I'm a man now
and not Mickey Mouse.
Is it true what Taina
has told the papers?
Depends on what she has said.
- That you hit her. Often.
I've never laid
a finger on a woman.
Girls can fight with
themselves if they want.
Matti! Don't.
I spent that summer
in front of the TV. Immovable.
Hello?
Oh my God!
Matti! Phone!
Hi. - Looks like I didn't
get to try ski-jumping.
You mean never again?
Both legs are paralyzed.
It's a miracle Antti is alive.
He dived head first onto a rock.
But surely doctors these days
can fix all sorts of things?
Operate or uh... - No.
Any plans for jumping?
- My motivation's sort of gone.
Make a come-back!
Home games this winter.
- I don't know.
Antti would like it even
he hasn't said it to us.
He told Mauri that
his dream is to see -
you take the gold at Lahti!
So we were a team again,
Coach and me.
Just like old times. Almost.
You need these more than I.
I had minor back problems.
But I didn't want to complain.
It was nothing compared
to what Antti was facing.
And then my back went.
Completely.
So you've had this multi-
dose medication since 82.
Any operations? - Right
leg three times, left once.
Regular knee injections
for five years.
My jumping technique
is hard on the knees.
And if I ease up on them,
my back suffers.
In a nutshell: you've jumped
too far, too long, too often.
Your back has been under
a severe strain for years.
Your back has been like
a car on a rough road -
without springs.
What should I do?
Jump a little shorter?
Medically, you should come
down from the tower in a lift.
What?
You need surgery. It would
be criminal to let you jump.
He must jump. Or the
budget goes down the drain.
Everyone wants to see Matti.
I'll drag him up and tie the skis
to his feet if I have to.
He owes us after all his fuck-ups.
And this so called back
problem stays under cover.
I think it's just alcoholic fantasy.
Any questions?
We'll have our own doctor
check out his medication.
It doesn't look too serious to me.
- They talked about surgery.
We don't operate
on healthy men here.
Simple daily procedure -
from now till the end of
the season. Both knees.
That's a lot of pills
for a healthy man.
This stuff keeps you that way.
Keeps you loose,
removes the tension.
Your problem is mainly
psychosomatic. Right? - Yeah.
Help!
Help! Help me!
Matti. Calm down.
Was it the same dream again?
Yeah. Always the same.
- Take it easy. It's just a dream.
I just fly and fly.
Never come down.
No jump goes on forever.
You always come down.
Dad never understood that
that was what I scared the most.
Dad never understood that
that was what I scared the most.
Then came the 1989
World Championships in Lahti.
Weissflog is leading but now
it's number 43 Matti Nykänen.
He is a three time
Olympic champion -
but here,
old merits don't count.
Matti is waiting for the signal.
He is looking at the hill -
where he has made
so many winning landings.
First time I was afraid.
It was not the jumping, -
although it hurt like hell.
But the landing was scary.
Not because of the pain
but because of the audience.
That was not enough to
take Matti into the lead.
Matti goes to 4th place,
with Weissflog leading.
When I saw the scoreboard, -
I knew that it was
the end of my career.
That was it.
My 19 medals were history.
The bronze and team
gold changed nothing.
Everything was meaningless.
Matti, don't! Matti!
- Let me go!
Let me go... - Matti!
Coach, coach...
Everything is okay.
There I was.
But I felt I wasn't there.
That I didn't even exist.
Not yet 30 and it was over.
During surgery, they
dropped me from the team, -
the sponsor's Mercedes
was repossessed, -
and the press
called me a drug addict.
But not even alcohol was
really ever a problem for me.
I've never had
an Antabuse capsule.
Never will.
I would never even
recommend that to anybody.
Why's that?
Are you taking
a bus somewhere?
If you drink with that bus-crap,
you get so sick.
At least I do.
Matti!
Did you hear me?
Come inside.
Visitors to see you.
You can't bury
yourself here forever.
It's been 18 months.
I have to look after my back.
It still hurts like hell!
I should've dealt with
your problems sooner.
But the Fed was pressing me.
- I don't blame anyone.
You don't need the crutches.
Not any more.
I need them to stand up.
No, you don't.
Have you even tried?
Have you tried?
- It's a bit different for me.
Antti's right.
Pull yourself together.
The doctors say...
What do they
know about my pain?
Maybe you don't have the guts.
What do you think about this?
This is the new
V-style by Jan Boklöv.
They say this is
the style in the future.
No offence, but I'm a mountain
eagle not a house sparrow.
Eddie Edwards made a record.
He was a clown,
even as a jumper.
The clown made a lot of money.
You know I can't sing.
With the
new studio technology, -
you'll sound like Sinatra.
It'll be something!
I don't know.
I made the deal already.
So you have to.
I don't have to do anything.
- Actually, you do!
Hammer is on his way -
with a contract that you signed
when we were in Helsinki.
I've signed nothing. And
who the hell is this Hammer?
You'll see.
- Why don't you come?
I've got other stuff to look after.
But I'll join the band
as soon as I can.
Matti! You know
you can trust me.
Who's your best friend?
Who can you always trust?
Nikke is your best friend
and that's me.
I'm serious!
And I'm leveling with you.
You'll make so much outta this,
it'll bust your wallet.
I'm still not sure.
Well, if you don't have the guts,
there's nothing we can do.
Howdy. Matti ready?
We gotta move it.
- Ready for what?
OK. Let's go.
- See you in two weeks.
It's showtime! - What?
There I was on the road again.
What did I have to lose?
Nothing at all.
You can call me Hammer.
We've gotta move on.
Where exactly is your studio?
- We drive there all night long.
But first we do a show. You get
to see a real rock 'n' roll show.
And there
I was in show business.
Welcome to the Aaron Sledge
Hammer Karaoke Evening.
I'll warm things up and
then the stage is yours.
There is Rauno Lehtinen's...
When I saw Hammer on stage,
I knew I had a lot to learn.
It was quite a show.
I have to admit,
Hammer impressed me.
Welcome to Levi's Vegas.
- Where the heck are we?
It ain't exactly Abbey Road but
you're not The Beatles either.
Where's the studio?
- There.
But that's a barn.
- Exactly. The Rhythm Barn!
All equipment is state-of-the-art.
You're in good hands.
We've made karaoke cassettes
here you won't believe.
Is there money in it?
- You mean in Karaoke?
More than in cell phones.
Karaoke and laser discs are the
future. And we can't wait for it.
There's the whole band!
What's up?
What's up? Welcome to Levi's
Vegas. - I said that already.
OK. All the songs
are ready to roll.
We just need
the maestro to sing a bit.
And then we get the vinyl to
the fans. - Who is this guy?
He's Nipa. He's my partner in
Ivel Records. - What's that?
Ivel is almost English.
Like "evil".
But it's also "Levi" backwards.
Pretty cool?
Best to give them
something to talk about...
Right. Rock 'n' roll.
It is starting to sound good.
Let's take a break.
Fuck. There's no way we can
make this work. - Turn it off!
Five days and it still sounds
like we're butchering sheep.
How many of the 12 songs do
we have even half-way ready?
That's your department.
- I'll tell you. One.
Nipa, Nipa...
We have too many songs.
No one wants to
listen to him singing 12.
Drop three of them.
Re-arrange the rest.
Make it rap. Anything.
Nine songs is enough.
- But we only have one!
He needs
a crash course to stardom.
Antti, please... We can't
even afford a dartboard!
You can't. But I can.
I have a friend in town.
I'll get him here to
coach Matti for a night.
What friend? - You'll see.
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.
Last time you said that,
I got beaten up.
Papas got a brand new bag -
and a moment of love-
making with the old bag...
Hell! Too many words.
No way anyone can learn this.
The man's here!
The dream fantasy of Finnish
babes, every eunuch's horror!
Lesson numero uno:
mikes shut, bottles open!
How long do I have to make
him a man? - One night?
If there's enough booze.
And only the two of us.
No one else!
At a regular pub gig,
you see the girls in the front.
Where are their eyes?
This must be a trick question.
- Below the waist!
Your dick is
the only thing they see!
Your street credibility
is in your balls.
You lose it if even one
of them doubts your mojo.
Don't worry about that.
I've had at least
300 women this year.
But it's only July. - Right.
Don't put all
your eggs in one basket.
Lay her and
then tell her it's over.
She knows
she can't own a player.
Women know that a player
is like a black panther.
A panther hot on the trail.
And before she realizes the
black panther is all over her.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
- What?
Do you understand?
- I'm beginning to.
I'm going to bed.
Now I'll punch you on the nose.
They're fighting.
- Boxing or wrestling?
Wrestling, I guess.
Silicon tits on an ugly woman -
is like putting a mahogany
steering wheel on a Lada.
Nice to touch, but the ride
doesn't get any better.
What about a rally wheel?
The ride is just as bumpy
but it's easier to hang on.
Matti, hey... - What?
You just graduated
to the club of players.
Others seem to know what you do
Where you come from
and where you go
Wherever you are
They seem to know whatever
you do, that's the way to go
It's best to give them
something to talk about...
If I do something, I give it 100%.
I was back on top again.
We broke house
records everywhere.
Matti Nykänen
gets a gold record.
Whatever I touched
turned to gold.
I became a real performer,
learnt how to talk the talk.
Get your lighters
out for the next song.
Grab your girls by the hand, -
or even below the waistline,
it's all the same with me.
Let's live this
great moment together!
We have today, who knows
what will happen tomorrow!
And I know what I'm talking
about. So look out!
When he arrives
everyone knows
That things will happen soon
He comes slowly,
behind the clouds like moon
When he moves you feel
like you want to move too
I was the King of gigs.
Over 300 a year.
At some point I thought
I started to slip -
although I said
I could do anything.
I was drinking heavier.
I was in this same
place a year ago...
Soon it began to show at
gigs and became a habit.
I don't know
what happened to me.
I guess I knew deep down they
didn't come for my singing, -
but out of curiosity.
I was an act
you only wanted to see once.
Few times we had to
refund the ticket money -
because I couldn't
get myself on stage.
A singing catastrophe,
they wrote.
Once again,
I was down and out.
Guys!
Guys!
I can't take it anymore.
This is the end!
Say bye to my loved ones.
I'm going down...
My popularity
took a nose-dive.
No more gigs.
We did a new record, Samurai.
But no one wanted to buy it.
It's been clear from day one -
that no one can tour
these places forever.
Except Karjalainen
and Popeda of course.
Yö. - And Yö.
But they'll crash, too.
Same thing here.
It's better to
quit while you're ahead.
It's a wonder it took this
long. - Yeah, but... but...
Be strong.
It was fun.
Keep up the spirit.
Eat something.
Nikke, I'll call you.
Matti, take my beer too.
That was that. Band over.
- No problems.
We landed in one piece.
Not quite.
We owe money on the BMW.
And the bus.
Which we don't need.
The bank account is empty.
Are you saying
you have nothing left?
I paid the bills.
As always. Studio.
Staff. Advertising. Dance girls.
Your 25%. The rent from
sleeping at your place.
Hello. Same guy.
Right.
Same address.
Just pick it up from there. Bye.
There went the BMW.
Way to go. Listen.
I have a brilliant idea.
We could make
a lot of money with it.
We need some starting capital.
For one full-page ad
in the newspaper.
Or a half-page.
- What kind of ad?
Don't worry.
Leave it to Manager.
After all that time, I should've
known better than to tag along.
But I did in the end.
We've decided to capitalize
on my success by turning it -
into hard cash which
I had never done before.
I hear you've had big offers -
for your medals
from foreign traders.
My manager
handles all my finances.
Don't you think it's
wrong if they go abroad?
Most of them came
from there, so, no.
But at one point -
you dedicated them
to the people Finland.
I was the one who jumped,
not the people Finland.
Besides, I never said that.
And If I did the press
twisted my words.
They know how to do that.
- That's true.
You're offering
Finland an alternative?
That's why I'm here on TV.
- Go ahead.
If the Finnish people
and Olympic Committee -
really appreciate
my achievements, -
they should start a collection.
I've had strong offers.
But 100 000 marks in
cash and the medals go -
to the Sports Museum.
It's a fair price, I would say.
And then we waited.
Pretty quiet.
It takes time.
Business is a tough game.
We dropped the price to half.
Then to 25.
And finally, to 10 000 marks.
Pretty quiet.
Yeah, it's taken
longer than I thought.
We've waited six months.
Should we
drop the price to 5 000?
No! What's six months?
On the grand scale?
Western life expectancy?
I'm getting pretty fed up. What
was the foreign offer anyway?
What? - Those traders.
Yes, that offer...
Well. It's like this.
To tell you the truth, -
we gave them the stories
about foreign interest -
to put the price up.
Hell! Bloody hell!
- My plan backfired!
Easy to be wise now!
Who had a better plan?
That was it for me.
I donated the lot to the
Sports Museum for free.
As Matti's manager,
I've always thought -
that these medals
are a national treasure -
and that they belong
here in this very museum.
Matti! Wait up. Listen.
Me and
the boys passed the hat.
We really appreciate this, Matti.
There it was, in my hand.
The price on my whole
career. A hundred marks.
We've fallen on our
asses too many times.
We're doing
everything all wrong.
It's a fifty-sixty chance I'll blow
the whistle and call it quits.
This from an old player.
Suicide is not the answer.
It did not work for me.
- I wasn't talking about suicide, -
I'm just sick of
getting nothing done right.
There's nothing left.
Might as well
become an alcoholic.
If they're after the medals,
it's too late now!
Nevada, Nick. Hi.
Yes...
Yeah, we're
paying vig all the time.
You saw for yourself.
It didn't work.
How much? That much?
No. That was a joke.
He'll never do that.
Right now?
How d'you
feel about relocating?
How come we owe money?
Last summer,
when we needed capital, -
I had to make calls.
Not to a bank.
What could I do in a casino?
Long time no see!
Have you briefed Matti
yet? - Kind of, yes.
Good. I don't need to explain.
Let's check out the premises.
This is Nikke's office.
What's going on?
This is where the girls work.
And this is Matti's place.
Come on!
We sell private tickets in here.
Come in, come in.
We cannot let people see
Matti with a regular price.
When you're not busy in here,
you serve tables, -
coming on hot and strong.
A few songs with the girls.
Take your time,
check the place out.
Hell! I don't have to do this.
Please tell me I don't.
As a matter of fact, you do.
We're in debt, up to here.
It's only a temporary solution.
I need to know you,
whatever the price
This is the night,
the night of surprise...
Thank you.
A big hand for Matti and
Natalia. Good, good.
If any of you
ladies or gentlemen -
would like to get to know our
singing legend privately, -
buy your tickets at the door.
Here they are.
In you go, they won't bite.
Not hard.
You've been here over a
month. - How time flies.
Are we even yet? - You're
not pulling in the customers!
I've tried to
look as sexy as I can.
At this rate, -
we'll be square...
in February 2006.
That's a long time.
I'll be well over forty then.
- Too long! Here's the deal.
We'll raise ticket prices and
you'll strip on the public side.
Hell, no! That's not the deal.
- As a matter of fact, it is.
Matti shows The Full Monty!
Don't drink too much.
A beer belly ain't sexy!
- I can't do this!
Sure you can.
Both our asses are on the line.
Pretend you're in a sauna.
- Why don't you go out there?
It's you who
got us here to start with.
Goddammit.
Come and
check out who's here.
Hammer!
I'm not going on!
- He's seen your balls before.
Yeah, but he's with his mother.
Take two of these and
you'll dance like Travolta.
Always works for me.
- What is it?
Vitamin stuff.
You'll be a new man.
And that man has
ball-bearings in the pelvis.
I don't think so. - Well,
if you don't have the guts...
I don't know what he gave me,
but, on stage, I was flying.
Just like in my ski-jumping days.
And I met Mirva
for the first time.
She went straight
to where it's at.
Pants off! Pants off! Pants off!
I did that with style as well.
Once number one,
always number one.
You're the King!
Did you hear it?
The windows steamed up.
Hammer invited
you to their table.
Nikke, back to work.
No time for chat.
A great show.
When people hear about
this, it'll be full house.
From tomorrow onwards it's
pants off, twice a night. Yeah!
This is Mirva and Jarmo.
So she's your mother,
not Hammer's?
What's she
doing in a place like this?
She's not my mother.
She's my sister.
I must have dozed off.
- Rest keeps a woman beautiful.
A pretty woman
can't sleep too much.
At least that's what I reckon.
That's just so sweet.
These are very
important sausage-makers.
You've tasted some
black sausage, haven't you?
That's what
you get for homo jokes -
when there's an
older lady at the table!
I bet you make all the girls so
hot they can't leave you alone.
Mirva pumped me up
till I couldn't back down.
Sorry, Masa. It was a joke.
I've had it with you, and Nick, -
and everyone else too!
Oh fuck!
I told Mirva and Jarppa
the long sad story of debts.
And Nick's role in it.
Terrible!
Why don't you just escape?
I've tried. But they watch me.
It's a bit like being in prison.
- Guess what we'll do, Jarppa?
Have another drink?
- That too.
But what else?
- I don't know.
Get something to eat?
- No, no.
Go buy Matti's freedom.
That took me by surprise.
She paid my debts like
she was buying a lollipop.
Do we buy Nick out as well?
- What do you think, Matti?
As I looked at that clown, -
I realized he'd been
bad news for 15 years.
Well, put it this way:
I won't sue him but... - OK.
You're going to Tampere with me.
- What's for me in Tampere?
Let's go sing in a karaoke bar.
I don't feel
like singing right now.
Listen. I'm a sports fan.
I've watched your career.
I'm your biggest fan.
I just adore ski-jumping.
Do you know why?
- Not a clue.
Only real men can do it.
Not immature jerks like that lot.
At least, that's what I think.
I've never done
anything that needed guts.
I've never had to.
You know why?
Because I'm a millionaire.
What do you say to that?
Well, put it this way: I could
reconsider that Tampere trip.
There I went again. I let her
do the talking. I went quiet.
It's not hard
to listen to praise.
Where's the karaoke joint?
- What?
Karaoke. - Karaoke is
cancelled for tonight.
This way, this way.
You must have
a big family to fill this!
Don't worry.
I live here all alone.
We can get
to know each other -
and make as much
noise as we want.
Sit down and get comfortable.
I'll go powder my nose.
It felt like things were
moving along a bit too fast.
Pants off! Pants off!
In no time, we were engaged.
And soon after that
I was a husband. Again.
Usually I need a drink
before making my move.
That time, I needed one
afterwards as well.
So here I sit, a married man.
Though I'd only planned on
having a few ciders in Tampere.
Do you ever argue?
- Never.
He's a wonderful
human being. Life's great.
With her, I feel really secure.
First time ever.
Life's just love and cuddles.
We look after each other.
There's no room for squabbles.
I do admit, we
talk louder than normally.
I'd tell you the reason
if I could remember.
We would
never hurt each other.
Love means accepting the down-
sides along with the good stuff.
I'm dropping all claims.
The scratches are from
falling into a rose bush, drunk.
I don't want him to go down.
We were both drunk.
This whole court case
is a mistake and I regret it.
I love Matti and he loves me.
I'm dropping all charges.
Many things in my life
could've remained undone.
It would've been easier
for me. And others.
I've never planned my life.
Just followed where it led.
Or done what
someone else wanted.
I've been lucky, too.
No one has died.
Though there's
been a few close calls.
I've said love is like a reel of
thread with a start and a finish.
With Mirva I've learned
that you can roll it back.
What sort of man am I?
I don't know. There
are always two versions.
The first is the one
that you have of yourself.
The second is how
everyone else sees you.
They're pretty different.
Both might be clear
but neither of them is true.
Then there's a third one
that lies somewhere between.
Happy midsummer!
Before we rock and roll,
I'd like to say one thing.
Sometimes life
seems pretty dark and grim -
but I still think that life
is the best time of your life.
Life is what else?
- Life!
What else is life?
- Life!
Life is... - Life.
One, two, three, four...
