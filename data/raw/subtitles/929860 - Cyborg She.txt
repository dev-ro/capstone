November 22, 2008
I had nobody who would celebrate
my birthday in the entire world with me
before I met her.
Wrap it, please.
Sure. Is this for a gift?
Yes.
Just a moment, please.
But last year, it was different.
For a very short time,
I had a girlfriend who
celebrated my birthday.
One year ago today
it happened at this store.
Last year
These ones over here
have just come in.
You might think about this.
It comes in black and beige.
What do you think?
Happy birthday.
I always buy a birthday gift
for myself.
Grandma told me to eat noodles
on my birthday for a long life.
I'm having the same spaghetti
at the same place again this year.
Do you like the spaghetti here?
I'll have something different.
Excuse me. Can I see a menu?
Yes, excuse me.
I'll take this and this
and this and this please.
And also...
I'll take this and this...
this, this, this and this too.
They have a 2005 Bordeaux. Great.
I want a bottle.
Certainly.
It's also my birthday.
No way!
Actually it's mine too.
Really?
Yeah.
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.
You should have some.
I'm full.
Let's go.
It's on me. Wait outside.
Well, we should split it...
Didn't I say it's on me?
It's your birthday.
I'll take care of it.
Disappear!
Hey, you two! Wait!
Wait!
Stop you two! Hey!
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Officer. They left
without paying their bill!
Excuse us, please.
Coming through.
Not this way. Which way?
That way!
Excuse us! Excuse us! I'm sorry.
Excuse us. Pardon us.
Coming through.
Wait, you two. Stop there!
I said wait!
Stop fooling around!
I thought
I was just following her,
but somehow It happened.
We ended up in front of my place.
Got it.
Come here. Hide.
Why are you still hiding?
It was here. He did...
He grabbed my shoulders...
and kissed me.
He's a bad man.
He said
he didn't like me anymore.
Because I eat too much
and I act crazy.
And he said I'm very jealous.
At first he didn't mind but
he said I punch him too hard.
I'm too rough, he said.
He doesn't even want to
see me walking.
Do I walk funny?
I know. Not bad at all, right?
Like a model?
Was it really all that hard?
Kind of.
Right.
I'm strong and rough.
Enough!
Calm down.
Why?
Because it's possible
someone else lives here now.
Right?
Whatever. I'm pissed
at whoever's here.
Why don't you try?
You'll feel better.
No thanks.
Haven't you had enough?
Close your eyes.
What?
Just do it.
Okay, my eyes are closed.
I have to say goodbye now.
Okay?
I don't want you
to see me leaving.
Close your eyes until I'm gone.
Okay?
Count to 1000, then open your eyes.
Make sure to count to 1000.
And...
Take this.
I bought this
for my birthday, really.
It's yours now.
Then you keep mine.
Thank you.
Actually...
I came from the future...
100 years from now.
In a time machine.
Surprised?
I am!
Goodbye.
Aren't your eyes open now?
No.
They're closed.
You're a liar!
I can see you clearly.
I've got very good eyesight,
better than 20/10.
Your eyes were open!
Were you looking at me?
No. They've really been closed.
You can come back and check.
Were they really closed?
You sound like an idiot.
You're an idiot!
You're right. I am an idiot.
Idiot!
You can open your eyes.
I'm okay now.
You can see me smiling, right?
It was like deja vu.
I felt a tear on my cheek.
I was crying
but I don't know why.
Actually, I thought she was crying
so It made me cry, I guess.
Sure. I can see you.
My eyesight is great, too.
It's better than 20/10.
I can see your smile.
Be careful going back!
Be careful going back...
Be careful...
going back...
I never saw her again after that.
It's been a year.
Going through my ordinary life
I kept waiting...
for this day to come.
I might be able to meet her again.
I somehow had a hunch.
Maybe I could...
76, 77, 78 thousand yen!
Here's a digital camera.
Not bad for an old bag's bag.
We cleaned up good.
Cute, isn't she?
Hey, baby! Nice threads!
So cool.
Aren't you cold?
Want my jacket?
Can I shave her face?
What's wrong with your eyes?
Ouch.
Oh shit!
When is this?
It's November 22.
What year?
What year!?
2008...
Daimaru Department Store
Miss?
Miss! Miss!
Excuse me!
I can't let you leave like this.
She's gone. This way.
Welcome.
This.
Excuse me, miss!
You haven't paid yet.
Please stop.
Help me!
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Whisky, a strong one.
Excuse me. One more.
Yes sir.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday to you too.
Happy birthday.
Present from me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Let's go.
Oh no, no, no, no...
Where's my key?
Did I lose it?
It's open now.
Sorry it's messy.
I'll clean it right away.
But this isn't so bad
for a guy living alone.
"Are you an idiot?"
You're my only lady guest
except my landlady.
But it smells okay here, right?
I have a special technique
to kill odors.
How are you, Jiro?
I am you, 65 years from now.
Please don't be afraid
of my appearance.
You must be feeling happy
to see your dream girl again.
But...
I'm here to tell you the truth.
She came back today but
it was not supposed to happen.
You were supposed to meet up
with the gunman, instead.
I took the awful bullets
that night...
and my body turned into this.
But ironically, the lottery ticket
I'd bought earlier was a big winner.
I spent all my money
and time on one thing.
I created her
to save you, me, 65 years ago
from that restaurant shooting.
She must have helped you out.
History changed and
time will right itself
and recalibrate to
the right dimension.
You are going to experience
a huge disaster.
But I'm sure she will
help you out again.
She is still like
a soulless doll for now,
but she'll learn things
from living with you.
One day she'll become able to
think and behave like humans.
She's programmed that way.
I'm sure you can make it happen.
You can give her a soul.
Take good care of her.
I hope you live your life
without regret.
So you were...
created and sent by me
from the future?
So you are a robot?
Don't call me a robot.
I'm a cybordyne model 103.
Bones: made of
casein multi alloy from Jupiter.
A cybernetic organism.
Brain: nanotechnologically
combined neurons.
Skin: organic tissue
just like humans.
Then, for example...
Are these just like humans?
Right.
So you are capable of doing it?
Doing it?
You know, "it."
What's "it"?
Sex.
Come here.
What?
Just come here.
Okay.
Face up.
Go and wash your face.
Oh, what did he mean
by "disaster"?
I can't talk about the future.
Okay.
Oh, that over there is my pet.
I named him Raoul.
It looks great.
Thank you.
What kind of meat is this?
It's a delicious pot of Raoul.
Raoul!?
That's how we started
living together.
Hey. What are you doing?
This is a place to study
so you need to be quiet.
Got it?
Jiro, run! If we are late,
we'll flunk.
I don't think we can make it.
Kyoko Iwashita.
- Taishi Endo.
- Here.
Jiro Kitamura.
Jiro Kitamura?
Here.
Kohei Kurihara.
- Kenta Sato.
- Here!
Yes!
Yuichi Shibasaki.
Kaoru Suematsu.
You...
How did you get here so soon?
I have no idea.
Here we go.
Top of the first inning!
Sato!
Be quiet!
Open to page 73.
I will explain this
with the diagram.
Who is she?
She's my friend.
You don't want that?
No.
Then I'll take it.
Let me join you.
What's your name?
I'm Kenta. Kenta Sato.
Why do you ask?
You are so straight. I like that!
You want us to start as friends?
She's got a healthy appetite.
She is. She ate my pet too.
What bizarre taste.
Speaking of bizarre.
There is an ethnic group,
the Chraumah, in the Near East.
I heard they eat
the shit of capybaras.
The recipe is odd.
They catch a capybara
and sew up its asshole.
To keep the shit in.
Then give it
a lot of its favorites.
After a week of feeding,
there is a lot of shit inside.
Then it's time
to open the asshole.
Grab the stomach like this
and squeeze the shit out
so they can eat.
You like shit?
Thank you!
Hey you, drink up.
We're friends.
She shouldn't.
I'm not sure how alcohol
will affect her.
Relax. All girls can
handle booze these days.
Don't you know
women rule the world?
See?
How was it?
This isn't good.
I think you're drunk.
Stop doing this and that.
You don't want to die, do you?
Shall we go home?
Let's go home.
Can you walk?
We gotta go.
See you all.
Hey, Jiro.
Bye now.
Are you okay?
...the integral of
sine n omega t by
T over 0 to 2,
then subtract...
...n omega t by T over T to 2
from that.
Professor, please be careful.
Class dismissed!
So from 2000 yen then.
Your change is 610 yen.
I'm going to the restroom.
Can you wait here for Mommy?
Welcome. Is this for here?
Yes. Let's see...
I want a Freshness Burger, regular.
Sorry. Say that again?
I want a regular Freshness Burger.
I want a regular coffee.
Mommy, I flew!
I flew in the sky!
I flew in the sky! Mommy!
Your girlfriend is very beautiful.
Looking for something?
Well...
Are you wearing
my underwear?
Two adults.
My 500 yen coin...
Thank God.
Jiro!
I...
Iove...
you.
What are you doing?
This is not for drinking.
Feeling okay?
Gotcha!
What happened?
Wash your face.
Last night, a fire happened
at a soccer training camp.
Three boys received minor burns.
It's suspected the fire was set.
Luckily, a miracle happened.
Someone burst into the room
and saved the kids.
It was too dark to see her face.
I woke up and I was in smoke.
A young woman came in
and saved us.
It's burning.
But that young heroine
disappeared from the fire scene.
They believe she was an angel.
An angel saved us.
I'm sure she Is an angel.
An angel helped us.
What, an angel?
Don't open it.
That man, his eyes bother me.
- Hey.
- What?
Let's visit your hometown.
My hometown?
My hometown is long gone.
A big earthquake razed my village
so we had to leave.
After that a new town
was created there.
Only strangers live there now.
My hometown is gone.
Don't you wanna go?
But it no longer exists.
You regretted not returning there
until you died of old age.
So I got old and died?
So I will die.
Right?
I will end up dying
like everybody else.
Hey, stop weeping
like a little girl.
You won't die soon.
That's not it.
I miss my hometown
and my grandmother.
I feel sorry for myself
for aging and dying...
Stop it.
Let's go.
Yes.
Thanks.
This is good.
Mouth too full.
I'm taking you to your hometown.
But you have to promise me.
No matter who will be there,
you can't talk to them. Okay?
Okay.
It's just the same as
when I was a kid.
Ryosuke?
That was Ryosuke.
He hasn't changed at all.
Jiro! Is that you?
Take a look.
Jiro gave these stones to me.
My daddy told me
these are fossils of brackens.
These are very, very old,
older than 100 million years.
He's me.
Me as a child.
You in the future asked me.
When I see Jiro in the past,
make sure to take him
to the hometown.
My house is there, I think.
We had a persimmon tree.
People called it
the Persimmon House.
Coming back from school,
Grandma always waited for me
at the village entrance.
But I didn't want to be seen
going home with Grandma.
