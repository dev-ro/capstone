I'm saying if you own
the beach property. . .
. . .do you own the sand and the water?
Nobody owns the water.
It's God's water.
What if someone waIks onto your beach,
if you own it?
No, you don't own the beach.
You own the sand on it.
What if there's a naked girI
on the beach?
She's not yours.
-What if she breaks her foot?
-She couId sue me.
Sue me! Sue me!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.
HoIy shit!
Ditch it, man! Ditch it!
-They're watching. Eat it.
-The whoIe bag?
Fuck it.
Hey, Mike, whiIe you're at it?
-Those are shrooms, dude.
-Come on, eat it.
-I hate to ask. For the team?
-I can't eat that!
Throw it out the window!
Okay. I'm doing a drop-off.
I'm going for it.
Just open the window.
It's gone.
-Gone.

-Come on.
-Put the windows down.
-AII right, we're cooI.
-We're cooI.
See that? There must've been
a doubIe-homicide or something.
We're fucking cooI.
We were freaking out for nothing.
-Did you eat both those bags?
-AII finished!
You must have eaten, Iike. . .
. . . $1 00 worth of pot. . .

-Who's the man?!
So I'm gonna need
1 30 buck. . .
. . .you know,
whenever you get a chance.
-Fuck, man.

Is that the same car?
Do I Iook high?
Yeah.

''Yeah, sure, sir. ''
-So you are okay, then?
-Yes, sir.
You smeII something, Rabbit?
Fear.
-Now hand over that registration.
-Yes, sir.
My mother's gonna kiII me.
-HoIy shit. Don't Iook, don't Iook.
-Oh, my God.
I don't get it, man.
Am I fucked up, or is this fucked up?
This shit is fucking crazy.
Shit, I was just about to puII out
my nine and put a cap in his ass.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, oh, my God. Shit.
-Oh, God.

Fuck!
Pull the vehicle over!

I'm freaking out, man.
You are freaking out, man.
You know why I puIIed you over?

Mother of God.
We're in pursuit of a Miata
heading south on 294.
Request backup.
Unit 91 , come in 91 .
Unit 91 , come in 91 .
What're you doing?
Quit counting your pubes.
Got a hellraiser in a Miata!
91, are you there? 91?
91, are you there?
Hey, good-Iooking.
Catch any speeders today?
Let's go, 91!
Rabbit, get that gun out!
Freeze, motherfucker!
Oh, Mac. You fucker.
Greetings.
You guys are too sIow.
-You kiIIed my dummy.

-Don't Iie in front of the rookie.
-Where are your shoes?
-You the shoe poIice?

-BIack magic doesn't work.
-Brown magic.
Pay up.
-When do I get to do that?
-You'II get your chance. Shots?
-That's a Iot of booze.
-Yeah. I'm impressed.
-Jesus!
-Sorry, boys. You're on duty.
-On your tab, officer?
-Rookie, pay the Iady.
Unit 23, come in.
Unit 23, come in, 23.
Do you need me out there?
Do you need my heIp?
-Shut up, Farva.

Listen, we got the Miata.
We're okay.
What about those dopers you picked up?
The snozzberries taste Iike

-Oh, shit.
-He kiIIed the cops.
No, man, this is a cop car.
HeIIo.
You boys Iike Mexico?
Come on, man!
We didn't smoke that weed!
One, two, three, do it.
Go, girIfriend.
Thorny, you're Iosing to the rookie.
It's embarrassing.
Rabbit, you can do it.
Rabbit, he's kiIIing you.
I got Thorny in front.
Mama didn't teach you to chug?
Come on, Thorn.
Come on, Thorn.
Goddamn it!
-I am aII that is man.
-Every time.
Finish it up.
You gotta open your throat.
ReIax the jaw.
Remember to cup the baIIs.
You won't win with those
thin bird Iips.
This guy's got powerfuI Iips,
right, Thorn?
My authority is derived
from the power right here.
Hey, guys.
Wow.
Thanks.
-You have any more syrup?
-Sorry, Urs.
Why couIdn't they chug ketchup?
Good thing you didn't
have hash browns.
I mean, if they had been
chugging the ketchup.
Did you get a score
on that Red Sox game?
Ah, waiter, there you are!
I wiII have the enchiIada pIatter
with two tacos, no guacamoIe. Mike?
Yeah, chief, I'II take a chinchiIIa!
I don't get it. Tacos?
-They think I'm Mexican.
-You're not Mexican?
Another highway cop?
Are you guys muItipIying?
If they can figure out
which hoIe to stick it in!
What the fuck?!
I saw that!
Sit down, Rando.
That's it!
Hey, hey, aII right!
Cut it out, you turkeys!
They fucking started it.
You guys are Iucky.
I'm sorry, Bruce.
These boys get that syrup in them,
they get aII antsy in their pantsy.
You shouId keep these dogs
on a Ieash, John.
Let's go.
A no. 1, top gun cadets
ln the name ofjustice
John Q. Public can trust us
-Hail to thee, dear old Paroon!
-Hail to thee!
Hail to thee!
-Hail to thee!
-Hey, aII right.
What's up, bone diddIies!
Did I miss a song?
-Sing it again, rookie!
-Farva!
-You forgot the coffee.
-My bad.
AII right, aII right.
Let's get started.
I got the Iatest shit Iist.
It's down to FIagstone,
Deer Lick and us.
We keep up these Iow numbers,
you bet your butts. . .
. . .we'II get the big, ugIy ax.
-Who'II bust heads on the highway?
-The IocaI cops.
And Grady has a copy of this Iist,
so we need to step it up.
Who wants cream?
Nobody? Okay, no cream.
How many tickets
did you issue Iast week?
I don't have my figures in front me--
Three.
-Can't make them speed.
-Try hiding.
-And grow a damn mustache.
-I haven't shaved in two weeks.
I'm growing mine.
I'II teII you when to grow a mustache.
Coffee served.
That's Rabbit's!
Okay, I get it.
Look. A bar of soap.
Oh, shit! I got you good, you fucker!
-Awesome prank.
-Better than the crap you puII!
-Look. . . .
-Bite it. Make him Iook Iike a dick.
Every Thursday night,
I waIk into the Iodge to pIay Hearts.
-They aIways have my OId Fashioned.
-Bite it.
-I Iike that.
-Bite it.
Oh, heII! Give me the damn soap!
We've got 50 miIes of highway.
I'II be damned if I Iet Grady
get his hands on it.
Thorny, you're ranking officer.
Let's do your jobs
and keep this pIace open!
Farva, your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.
LocaI Smokies on our turf.
Hit it.
That's what O'Hagan was taIking about.
Hi.
You forget what coIor your car is?
Bye-bye.
-Later, dude.
-How about ''Cat game''?
What's the record?
Thorny did six.
I think you can do 1 0.
Ten? Starting right meow?
Sorry about that.
AII right, meow.
License and registration.
Your registration?
Hurry up, meow.
Sorry.
Is there something funny here, boy?
No, no.
WeII, then why are you Iaughing,
Mr. Larry Johnson?
-Meow, where were we?
-I'm sorry, are you saying ''meow''?
Am I saying ''meow''?
I thought. . . .
Meow, do you know
how fast you were going?
-Meow, what's so damn funny?
-I thought you said ''meow. ''
Do I Iook Iike a cat to you, boy?
Am I jumping nimbIy-bimbIy
from tree to tree?
-No.
-Am I drinking miIk from a saucer?
Do you see me eating mice!?
Stop Iaughing right meow!
Yes, sir.
Meow, I have to give you a ticket.
-But--
-No buts, meow. That's the Iaw.
Not so funny meow, is it?
Meow.
Thanks for washing my car, rook.
-You know what this is?
-A chamois cIoth?
Lucky guess. I just Iost a buck. . .
. . .to myseIf.
-Think that's funny, do you?
-Yeah, I do.
Heard something funny
about how you got suspended.
Something about a schooI bus?
Oh, you heard that, did you?
Let me teII you another story.
Back in '74, CharIie Rich was named
Country Musician of the Year.
In '75, he had to hand the award
to the new winner.
Mr. Sunshine on My Goddamn ShouIders,
John Denver.
-RepIaced by John-fucking-Denver.
-Wow, amazing.
Mr. Rich puIIed out his cigarette
Iighter and Iit that award on fire.
Get it?
So you're gonna set my
Country Music Award on fire?
When my suspension's up,
you better watch your ass.
Or you'II Iight my ass on fire?
-Wanna go?
-You smeII pretty. Make your move.
Hey, honky convention, we got a 1 0-92.
Want this one, Rod?
-HeII, yeah!
-I bet you do.
Nice wax job, rook.
Thank you, sir.
We got IocaI pigs running around.
How'd they beat us here?
We're 1 0 miIes out.
Look at this chump.
-Mr. Tough Guy here.
-Take a waIk, buddy.
HoIy shit!
CooI Winnebago.
My uncIe had one just Iike this.
-Rabbit, put your game face on.
-You got it, boss.
What the fuck?
Ah, yes.
-Ah, man.
-What happened?
Take a waIk.
This investigation is under controI.
WeII, now it is.
-Hey!
-Don't touch the crime scene, Rodent!
Rabbit.
Hey, Iook at that.
Johnny Chimpo.
Quit sIapping me!
-Stop touching my rookie, Grady.
-I'II touch you!
This is the Spurbury PoIice!
Put your hands up and come out!
Get the fuck out of here!
-GIamour pet.
-Let's go.
No dice. Get the tape.
-Sounds Iike a hog probIem.
-Watch it.
-I'm serious, Mac. He's angry.
-He's angry?
Back it up, Grady.
-Mark it off.
-Smy, you mark it off!
Back it up. I'm serious.
Didn't you guys get shut down?
Oh, yeah. That's next week.
Your bust.
There's a dead chick in there.
Move it, Ramashit!
Back it up, Grady!
Fight, fight!
What the fuck?
Ow, my arm!
Mac!
Get off of me!
I'II give you the fat guy for Foster.
How about the stupid guy for Rabbit?
You have to be more specific.
They're both fat and stupid.
-Get these damn handcuffs off, now!
-Cut him Ioose.
Go ahead, Smy.
TeII me what bug crawIed up your ass.
I'II teII you. This is our crime scene.
We're taking it.
It's highway. Our jurisdiction.
This highway's cIosed, Ramathorn.
This is our jurisdiction.
Fuck it. You deaI with the hog.
-Hey, chief.
-What the heII's gotten into you guys?
I toId you to be good,
that it's a bad time.
But you get into a fight
with the IocaIs.
-They started it!
-Of course!
They fiIed a jurisdictionaI grievance.
They want us to bIow it.
A murder on the highway,
and you give them the investigation!
Christ! We Iook Iike a bunch
of pussies.
AII right, come on out, Rabbit.
Guess I'II just take a shower, then.
Strike three! You're out!
AII right, good cut, Richie.
Next batter. Batter up!
Come on, CaroIine!
You know, if they do shut you down,
maybe you couId stick around here.
Get a different job.
You couId work in my shop.
Ex-cop goes to work in his
hippie girIfriend's head shop?
Too sitcom, darIing.
Better pay attention, coach.
Our son's up.
-Okay, ArIo, watch the baII.
-You got it.
-Let's do it.
-AII right, ArIo.
Ferris!
-BuIIshit!
-Gotta keep on your toes!
Come on, what was that?
Sorry-ass IocaI cops.
You have a reIationship. . .
. . .based on professionaI courtesy
and mutuaI boredom.
Next thing,
they're trying to take you out.
I don't wanna get transferred.
Be a rookie with some random dudes.
Don't worry.
If it happens, we'II aII stay here.
Open up a roIIer disco.
Throwing the heat.
Bring it on.
WeII, anybody want a corn dog?
See if they got any chocoIate bananas.
Hey! CharIie's AngeI!
CongratuIations! You're the miIIionth
person to say that to me.
What do I win?
-Here.
-Hope I don't get brain freeze.
I'm not sure you've got
the required equipment.
So I had a great time
at that Winnebago fight.
Maybe we couId do it again sometime.
AII right, fair is fair.
You can sIug me back, if you want to.
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.
Okay, hoId my snow cone.
Heads up!
-What happened?
-AsshoIe!
What?!
Why?
How about a IittIe pep?
From those guys.
-AsshoIes.
-Wanna move that, buddy?
So about my fieId time.
I've thought about that.
I might be abIe to taIk to Grady.
-The pink stick, eat it or Iose it!
-Shut your pie hoIe!
I'm ready to go out on patroI.
I'm going nuts being on the radio.
I'd Iike some fieId work.
Then take your radio
and go stand in a fieId.
-Move that gigantic cotton candy!
-Goddamn it!
How's the view, bitch?
I'm Iooking for Grady,
I have some fiIes.
Grady's not here.
I'II take them.
It's kind of important.
How about Officer Rando?
No. I'm the onIy one here.
There are no maIe officers around?
Just give me the fiIe.
What's this?
So are you originaIIy from Vermont?
You've got courage,
waIking into the Iion's den.
-I got brass buns.
-Join the band.
Are these ceIIs eight-by-eight?
Ours are nine-by-nine.
No big deaI.
You seem Iike a nice guy,
but I just don't date cops.
I'm not much of a cop.
I'm a civiIian trapped in a cop's body.
You can get an operation for that.
But you'd miss out on those
wacky things highway guys do.
Those stories are mostIy Iies.
Except for when we
puIIed over AC/DC's bus. . .
. . .and they fIew us down to Jamaica
to party with them.
Other than that,
it's boring out there.
Yeah, weII, I wouIdn't know.
It's time for you to go.
I don't wanna get fired too.
I'm not getting fired.
I'm getting shut down. Big difference.
In our ceIIs, the door is over here.
Right.
A coupIe of hyenas.
You know, they are speeding.
-Come in, Radio.
-Don't caII me Radio, Unit 91 .
Then don't caII me Unit 91 , Radio.
-Are you done?
-Yeah. Okay, Radio.
Suspicious vehicIe.
White Caprice from Vermont.
Tijuana, Gringo, One, Five, Zero.
-Roger, checking.
-Thank you, Radio.
That license plate belongs
to a local Spurbury police car.
It does? Oh, my God.
Very funny, 91 .
Thank you, Radio.
That truck's pIanning
on skipping the weigh-in.
WeII, you don't weigh in,
you don't wrestIe.
Is this guy trying to puII him over?
There's no fucking way
that is happening.
What the heII's he doing?
-AII right.
-That's right, doofus, move it aIong.
Do you wanna do ''Repeat''?
Do you wanna do ''Repeat''?
I've been thinking a Iot
about what the captain said.
-I'd Iike to pIay it straight, okay?
-Okay.
-For O'Hagan.
-For O'Hagan.
Good morning. Step down
with your Iicense and registration.
-Sure, I was--
-Morning.
Mind stepping down with your
Iicense and registration?
Yeah. No probIem.
Excuse me one second.
No.
Excuse me one second.
No?
Did I do something wrong, officers?
Because I know I wasn't speeding.
-Why didn't you weigh in?
-Yeah?
Did I miss that weigh station?
I'm running so many miIes.
I'II puII into the next one
and get weighed up.
What are you puIIing back there?
WeII, mostIy soap, I think.
Why don't we take a Iook?
-Officers, I'm on a tight scheduIe--
-Let's go, Mr. GaIikanokus.
WeII, you heard him.
Let's go, mister. . . .
Mr. GaIinookan?
Hop on up.
-Okey-siIIy-dokey-o. I'm an idiot.
-Yeah, that's true.
Sorry about the Iight there.
I have a fIashIight in the cab.
Hey. Mr. GaIikanokus.
Mr. GaIikanokus.
-ShouId've seen that coming.
-ShouId've.
It is time to stop now, Mac.
It is?
Time to stop now? Mac?
That was the second time I got crabs.
-Afternoon.
-Hey.
It stinks Iike sex in here.
What happened?
We got distracted
by somebody doing the ''Repeater. ''
-That'II happen.
-That wiII happen.
You did it. They're fishing
your car out of Lake Le BIanc.
-Oh, man.
-We just parked it across the street.
Listen, the next time this happens,
I want you to stop, breathe. . .
. . .and puII your heads
out of each other's asses.
That's easy for you to say.
He's got a tiny head.
-What's this guy moving?
-Soap, I think.
What's up, soapy?
Reefer.
-That's one stinky pyramid.
-We shouId have buiIt a stinky igIoo.
That's a Iot of pot.
-Thinking of tour dates with the Dead?
-What?
-Better Iock it up.
-What are you saying?
Enhance.
Enhance.
Enhance.
Just print the damn thing.
What do we know
about this GaIikanokus guy?
Fake name, fake Iicense.
-Bunty Soap?
-Fake soap company.
-PIastic fake? Decorative fake? What?
-They don't exist.
We got 1 50 kiIos of marijuana.
No arrests. We got nothing.
I got a theory, Cap.
These baIes of pot have red
Johnny Chimpo stickers on them.
That dead woman
had a tattoo of the same Iogo.
Drug deaIers use stickers
to mark products.
-Like a brand name.
-See?
-Did you Iearn that in drug schooI?
-Shut up, Farva.
Did the bag from the coIIege kids
have that sticker?
I don't beIieve it did.
-Any marijuana on that Winnebago?
-No.
A monkey tattoo.
It sounds kind of fIimsy.
What's the significance
of this John Chimpo feIIa?
You know those cheap
Japanese cartoons?
No? This is basicaIIy
a cheaper Afghani knockoff.
It's a monkey that traveIs around
doing nasty things.
His butIer tries
to keep him in Iine, but no.
It's funny.
It's Afghanistanimation.
The monkey has a butIer? Great.
-Is that what they do in Arabia?
-How shouId I know?
-AII right.
-Shut up.
Get me a VTR copy. I'II see if Grady
wiII Iet us Iook at the Winnebago.
Ready for the photo shoot?
Let's take it.
-PuII down your pants.
-Farva, you idiot.
John?
-I'm not interrupting, am I?
-Mayor Timber. No. Come in.
-Good work, gentIemen.
-Thanks.
-CouId I get in on that?
-Sure. Why not?
-Hey.
-Good work, officer.
It'II be hard shutting us down.
We got a murder one day,
a drug bust the next.
We need as much
poIice as we can get.
-That'd be a good sIogan.
-TeII it to the committee.
I just got off the phone with Governor
Jessman, and she's coming here.
Give me a gun. For the pictures.
Rabbit. Run. Gun.
John, as far as aII
this brawIing is about--
It won't happen again. I'm on it.
Good. When the governor shows up,
I'm gonna throw her a IittIe party.
We'II show her how this community
feeIs about its Iaw enforcement.
Spread it on.
-Come on.
-What's the deaI with you and Bobbi?
You guys are going out
but you sIeep with other peopIe?
WeII, I mean, yeah. Not reaIIy.
Kind of.
It's sort of a Iong story, aII right?
ArIo, does Mom ever have any
friends over? Any oIder boys?
-Can we turn the siren on?
-In a minute. Are you Iistening?
She have anyone that you caII ''uncIe''?
-Like UncIe Fred?
-UncIe Fred? Who's UncIe Fred?
He's this crazy bird on TV.
He fIies around Iike a pigeon.
Right. UncIe Fred. He's crazy.
Crazy bird.
Okay. We got one.
You wanna take this one, kid?
-What about you?
-I gotta stay with LittIe A.
-You're okay, right?
-Sure.
Go on. Make Mama proud.
Yeah, Farva. I got a Porsche. Brown.
Washington pIates. Eight.
-Donna, Peanut, Eunuch.
-Roger, checking.
KiII it.
Can I see your Iicense and--?
I'm sorry, officer,
for the speeding vioIation.
I am used to driving on the autobahn.
What?
Yummy, yummy.
-Do you know why I puIIed you over?
-We were driving too fast.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
Officer, this is a probIem. I cannot
afford another ticket with my Porsche.
Is there maybe something
I couId do for you?
Or maybe my wife couId do for you,
to avoid this diIemma?
Is there something you wouId
Iike me to do to you?
Or maybe something you wouId
Iike to do to me?
Because you were doing 90 in a 65. . . .
Perhaps some spanking
and cuffing is in order.
CouId you hoId on a minute?
I'II be right back.
-Twenty-three, that Porsche is hot.
-Are you sure?
Rabbit.
-Hey, Rabbit.
-PIease, Thorn, not now.
-He can join too.
-No.
-Get over here.
-No. No.
Just one second.
What?
-Farva said that car is stoIen.
-What? StoIen? Shit!
-Is there a probIem, officers?
-HoId on.
Come on, Thorn, I need this.
Another day, I'd step in and show you
how to swing, but the car's stoIen.
Goddamn it!
You gotta get over there and cuff her.
Do it. You're a highway patroIman.
Cut it out!
Do it. Turn that off
and step out of the car.
This is no probIem.
Put your hands on the car.
Some fun for both of us!
Get back in the car!
Rabbit, get over there and cuff her.
-Up against the car.
-Ma'am, I hate to do this.
-Hands behind your back.
-Things are getting kinky.
ArIo, wouId you stop?
ArIo. Rabbit. Let's go!
-CIimb up on UncIe Rabbit's Iap.
-That's not a good idea.
Why don't you just sit in the middIe?
There's no TP in the bathroom!
-What about the piece on your shoe?
-What about it?
Shit! You know, you might get ahead
here if you made the extra effort!
-You want me to wipe your ass?
-That's not what I. . . .
In my house,
my wife knows to refiII the TP!
I'm not your wife.
If you were,
I'd take you down a peg or two.
Hi, douchebag.
If you were my wife, I'd rub your feet
every night untiI you feII asIeep.
Nice try.
He strangIes them and puts their face
in pig food? What an asshoIe.
-Any I.D. on the corpse?
-Jane Doe. You know her?
We're working on it.
It's caIIed routine poIice work.
She had a cartoon monkey
tattooed on her back.
John Chimpo, I'm toId.
And those cannabis bags
in our truck. . .
. . .those stickers had the same Iogo.
There's a connection.
Are you suggesting a cartoon monkey
is bringing drugs into our town?
-I know we don't Iike each other--
-I Iike you.
Come on, I'm Iooking for
a IittIe cooperation here.
John Chimpo.
Hanson, round up Johnny Chimpo,
Jerry Giraffe and Arty the AIIigator.
Bring them in for a Iineup.
Thanks, sweetie.
They're having fun.
That happens when you're with a
state trooper. We show you the funny.
Where were we?
You were Iaying your best rap on me.
I was resisting.
-You're starting to think about it.
-I don't touch highway hog.
Baby, I'm SizzIeLean!
I scratched your back, Bruce,
good and hard.
Now, scratch mine or you'II get
my size-1 0 boot up your ass.
Desperation is a stinky coIogne, John.
Let's see, you're an expendabIe Iine
item on a state spending biII.
You have a station
fuII of crappy cops.
I'm about this far away
from having a bigger budget.
Now you come in taIking about monkey
tattoos on some drunk Iady's tit. . .
. . .Iike it's a goddamn
drug conspiracy?
Keep your bags packed, John.
Let us handIe the reaI poIice work.
And when you do get shut down,
come taIk to me.
I can aIways use a good meter maid.
Let it roII.
Come and get me.
Sucker!
Oh, fuck!
Here comes the Rabbit!
-Damn it!
-Out of the fucking car, scumbag.
WeII, heIIo, ShirIey.
-Come on, Farva. Same team.
-What's Thorny gonna say?
-HonestIy, Bobbi, it's gonna happen.
-We don't want to Ieave.
I'II just get sent down
to BrattIeborough. It's a nice town.
It's not a heaIthy time
for him to move.
-He has a Iot of good friends here.
-Who? That creepy kid with the Iisp?
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.
-I don't want to go without you.
-Then you shouId stay.
I can't if they transfer me.
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
Hey, honey.
It's aImost mitternacht, eh?
You shouId get back to the jaiI. You
don't want us turning into pumpkins.
I'm not ready. I don't want to go yet.
Can't they just stay a IittIe Ionger?
AII right.
Who wants a mustache ride?
-I want one! I want one!
-I do! I do! I do!
-Spurbury PoIice.
-Oh, thank God. lt's terrible.
There's a pervert flashing people!
-Ma'am, I need you to caIm down.
-l can 't calm down! Oh, my God!
TeII me your Iocation?
He's right in front of the
building on 323 Karuna Street.
-That's this address, ma'am.
-Then maybe you can see him!
Go look. l'll hold.
Did you see him? Oh, he's disgusting!
-He certainIy is, ma'am.
-He's going to the window again!
Oh, the humanity!
He's aII buIgy, he's Iike a moose!
Oh, no. I think he's going back again!
Freeze, motherfucker!
Oh, God! PIease don't shoot me,
I'm naked!
-Drop your coat and grab your toes.
-What?
I'm gonna show you
where the wiId goose goes.
This isn't happening!
I'm a poIice officer. UrsuIa, heIp!
Baby, I'm gonna butter your bread.
You don't have these at your station?
I don't suppose you've got a pair
of underwear I couId borrow?
I'm not sure you couId fit
into my panties.
-You can't teII anyone about this.
-I aIready toId my mom about you.
Wait! Wait! Wait!
-Shit!
-Baby, you rocked me.
Wow. What is this?
-Rabbit, you're off the road!
-Good--
Shut up! Rabbit, you're on radio.
Farva, you ride with Thorn.
-Wait!
-What do you want me to do?
My hands are tied. Rabbit,
you couIdn't pick a worse time.
I got a Q-1 7 request form today.
We have to inventory our equipment.
Which means our baIIs
are this cIose to the band saw!
What are you seIIing, Mac? Hot dogs?
New biIIboard.
-Casino Ie Fantastique?
-Yeah.
Humped the mayor's wife
and burned down city haII?
I'II do you one better, captain.
So I'm waIking by
the IocaI poIice station. . .
. . .but there's something funny
in the air.
I feeI Iike I got to get in
that Winnebago.
-After I jimmy the door, I do a recon.
-BuIIshit.
I saw something was wrong
about that bed.
-So I busted it in.
-BuIIshit.
And just sitting there
were 1 0 duffIe bags of these.
Let me get this straight. You went
into the impound, scaIed the fence. . .
. . .broke into the Winnebago
and smashed the bed, aII on a hunch?
I'II beIieve that when me shit
smeIIs Iike rainbow sherbet.
What? Do you think I just
grew this weed?
How couId you know
to Iook under the bed?
It must have been my sixth
or even seventh sense.
Good cops don't know
why they do anything.
-Disregard that, Rabbit.
-You didn't even caII your partner?
These IocaIs have 1 00 keys of cheeba
and they don't even know it?
No cIue. It's hidden.
And Grady's waIking around Iike he's
hot soup. We've got a chance.
We've gotta beat them to the punch.
Mac, you and Foster
check out the truck stops.
Find out about GaIikanokus.
I'II pIay hardbaII with Grady.
Thorny, I'm taking a hard Iine here.
You gotta promise me no more buIIshit!
I'm cooI. I take no responsibiIity
for these white deviIs.
WeII, you're gonna have to.
Now, Rodney, we're under
a Iot of pressure here.
Remember what we taIked about.
If anything happens, count to 1 0,
take some deep breaths.
-Ten deep breaths. I got it.
-Fossy, you're on duty.
Trust me, skipper.
We'II make you proud.
You are awesome. You are incredibIe.
You are a fantastic cop.
Keep going.
And then somebody said, I think it was
O'Hagan, ''You deserve a promotion. ''
I think you get a star.
Foster? I don't know
if this is gonna work.
The steering wheeI
keeps jabbing my ass.
In New York City, a guy couId pay $1 0
to watch two cops have sex in a cage.
-Foster?
-Yeah?
In our cruisers, somebody has
to Iet you out of the back seat.
Oh, fuck it!
Do we Iook Iike the
dumbest guys in the worId?
Why treat us with such disrespect?
I'm saying, switch partners.
It'II be fun.
-I don't think so.
-Come on. Mix it up a bit.
No fucking way.
Come on, Mac, you're aIways saying
how funny Foster smeIIs.
Look out for Thorny!
Master of psychoIogy!
Do I reaIIy smeII?
AII right! Quit taIking about me!
-Lock and Ioad! Let's kick taiI!
-We weren't taIking about you.
BuIIshit!
-Truck stop, huh?
-We gotta do it.
Captain didn't mention
going undercover.
Think they'II teII us anything
if they know we're cops?
You're Supercop.
You shouId know this.
I am super.
We can't take our car untiI they fix
the door you removed for no reason.
I toId you it was those kids
with the wrenches.
Those punks who took the door off
whiIe you were sitting in the thing.
I was in a very deep sIeep.
You wanna teII that to O'Hagan?
Maybe we can borrow his car today.
Know how to drive this?
Shit! This rig sucks.
Who knew it was a stick?
How about we pop a coupIe Viagra. . .
. . .and issue tickets with raging,
mega-huge boners!
OnIy you, Farva,
couId make a dark man bIush.
-And no, we're not doing it.
-Aw, heII.
I came up with a great name
for our car.
-Oh, yeah?
-Get this.
You're Arcot Ramathorn. Ram.
And I'm Rod Farva. Rod.
Car Ramrod.
-Car Ramrod. Get it?
-Yeah, I got it.
-Rabbit, I got a PIymouth Voyager--
-Say, ''Car Ramrod. ''
HoId on. Vermont pIates.
AIpha, God, Mustard.
-Niner, Decade, China. Check it.
-Roger, 23.
-You didn't say it!
-I forgot.
-I wrote it on the paper.
-Oh, yeah.
-Come on. What game we pIaying?
-No games.
Don't buIIshit me. Let's pIay one
of those games I hear about.
Mac and Foster did that thing.
Who can say ''pussy'' the most.
ActuaIIy, Mac bet Foster he
couIdn't say ''meow'' 1 0 times.
To the driver.
-I reaIize it doesn't sound funny.
-Who can say ''meow'' the most?
You guys are reaI crazy.
Look out for these guys.
HeII, I can say ''meow. ''
I can say ''moo. ''
For 20 bucks,
I'II caII the guy a chickenfucker!
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod!
License and registration,
chickenfucker!
-Bruce? John O'Hagan.
-I'm gIad you caIIed.
I have Bobby the Baboon in Iockup.
For 20 bananas,
he'll provide evidence...
. . .Johnny Chimpo is the pimp behind
the Cartoon Network whorehouse.
Look. We got new evidence
on your murder.
Who? GaIikanokus?
You know where he is?
We don't know, but--
I don't see how you can
heIp us, then.
Okay, this is my Iast offer.
Either you Iet us in or I'm gonna
embarrass you personaIIy.
How embarrassed?
Like, naked in a dream embarrassed?
No, embarrassed Iike when you got
caught fucking your cousin.
She's not my cousin.
-Can I take your order?
-Give me a doubIe bacon cheeseburger.
DoubIe baco-cheeseburger.
It's for a cop.
-Roger.
-What's that? He gonna spit in it?
I was just teIIing him that
so he makes it good.
-Don't spit in that cop's burger.
-Oh, thanks.
Roger. Holding the spit.
-Give me a pie. AppIe.
-Do you want me to hoId the spit?
Just kidding. Want to Dimp-a-size
your meaI for a quarter more?
You want me to punch-a-size your face?
Some maIe figure? I'm his dad.
And stop with the transfer thing.
I gotta go.
Let's taIk about this Iater.
Okay. Bye.
Don't give me any Iip.
It's a quarter.
Look how much more you get.
No!
-It's just 25 cents.
-He doesn't want it.
I can handIe this. I don't want it!
Right. Beverage?
-Give me a Iiter of coIa.
-A what?
A Iiter of coIa.
LeederacoIa?
Do we make LeederacoIa?
Just order a Iarge, Farva.
I don't want a Iarge Farva.
I want a Iiter of coIa!
I don't know what that is.
''Liter'' is French for ''give me some
coIa before I break vous fucking Iips! ''
AII right! ReIax!
-Does that Iook Iike spit to you?
-Yeah.
Fuck it.
I feeI Iike a cop again.
I wouIdn't get used to it.
It's not gonna Iast.
-BuIIshit. I'm not going anywhere.
-AII right, buddy.
We're about to be shut down anyway.
-That's a Iot of Dimp.
-What'II you do if they transfer you?
Bobbi doesn't want to Ieave.
I don't wanna Ieave her and ArIo--
I got no idea what I'm gonna do.
Who cares.
I'm about to win $1 0 miIIion.
What'II you do with it? Don't say,
''Buy the CIeveIand CavaIiers. ''
-I'd buy a $1 0 miIIion car.
-I'd puII you over.
-BuIIshit. You couIdn't catch me.
-I couIdn't catch you?
If you did, I'd activate my car's
wings and fIy away.
I got a good feeIing about this.
Damn it! You burger punk--
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, burger boy.
AII right, aII right.
Cut it out, you guys. Knock it off.
CIear out of here. AII of you.
Sorry about the deIousing, Rod.
Standard procedure.
It's powdered sugar.
The Iice hate the sugar.
-Listen, Rod--
-It's deIicious.
Good. Good. Say, Rod, what are
your pIans after the shutdown?
We're not getting shut down, Grady.
We're drug busters.
Maybe they're drug busters,
but you're dispatch.
-I'm back on the road now.
-UntiI this IittIe incident.
Listen, Rod,
this whoIe murder thing. . . .
We've been trying to break it
open but O'Hagan just won't cooperate.
I've spoken to the governor myseIf.
She's gonna shut down your station.
I'm gonna have a bigger budget then,
and I couId use an officer Iike you.
Can I go now?
CouId have your own car.
Work on exciting cases.
Hey, we can go after
drug deaIers together.
Here's the thing, Rod.
I just need to know your side
of the investigation.
O'Hagan is making
aII kinds of threats.
Can we make a deaI?
I'm aII highway.
Let him Ioose.
Sorry about that, bro.
Hey, CharIie's AngeI!
-What's up?
-Guys.
Hey.
WeII, we've got 20 desk Iamps.
-Farva went schizoid.
-That's good.
How'd the undercover thing go?
Not so good.
Turns out this guy can't drive a semi.
You watch that Johnny Chimpo thing?
-Funny, but nothing there.
-Maybe you missed something.
Trust me. There's nothing there.
Maybe we shouId take another Iook.
-That's it! You're off the road!
-It wasn't my fauIt.
We used to take a guy Iike
you and beat you with a hose.
-Now you got your unions.
-You know I'm not pro-union.
-You're banned from Dimpus Burger.
-Damn.
Get some rubber gIoves.
From now on, you're my cIeaning Iady.
Beat it!
WeII, the butIer is basicaIIy saying
to Johannes Chimpo:
''Don't Iet the Great Satan
tempt you with Western cuIture.
You must remain true to the
TaIiban warIord. ''
So GaIikanokus is not the butIer?
WeII, possibIy.
This is quite briIIiant, reaIIy.
So, capitan, you think there might be
some connection to the smuggIers?
-Get this meatbaII out of here.
-Got it.
Come on, meatbaII.
Back in the cage
with your beautifuI wife.
-What happened at the weigh station?
-My cruiser weighs 1 6,000 kiIograms.
I taIked to the budget committee.
This Farva thing screwed us.
-They can't Iump us with that Martian!
-We're aII in the same boat.
-Our shenanigans are cheeky and fun.
-His shenanigans are crueI and tragic.
Which makes them
not shenanigans at aII.
EviI shenanigans.
I'II pistoI-whip the next guy
that says ''shenanigans. ''
Farva! What's that restaurant with
aII the goofy shit on the waII?
You mean Shenanigans? You're
taIking about Shenanigans, right?
Put those away.
Rabbit.
Yeah, I know.
You got beautifuI, big, brown Iips.
Have your fun, boys. Have your fun.
I'm gonna start Iooking for a new job.
Sorry I'm Iate.
The mayor came down today.
Biker. I'm an idiot.
You guys keep shooting
yourseIf in the foot.
-I heard you got to see Farva naked.
-Yeah, it was hard to miss.
Grady thinks he's got you guys
by the baIIs.
You Iike Iong-distance reIationships?
I think I'm getting sent to Deer Lick.
I've been thinking about this.
I might have an idea.
The governor comes to town
on Saturday.
She's speaking on drugs
and Iaw enforcement. . .
-. . .because of your bust.
-She's stiII shutting us down.
Not if you give her more.
Get the reefer out of the Winnebago
and give it to her during the party.
-She'd Iove the pubIicity.
-She can't shut you down.
It's Iocked in the Winnebago, in your
impound, and guarded by asshoIes.
Here's what I'II need: five ski masks,
smoke bombs, the good ones. . . .
Foster. How about if I
just heIp you get in?
-You wouId do that for me?
-Yeah.
What the heII. We'II work together.
Like Cagney and Lacey?
-Cagney and Lacey were women.
-I couId be Lacey.
So that's it, huh?
CCS Rockman BuIIetproofing
is the tops.
Same guys who make our fIak jackets.
A good cop does what before using
his equipment in the fieId?
-They test it?
-They test it. ExactIy.
How you shooting today, Thorn?
Dead-on aII morning.
-How about that IittIe feIIa?
-That IittIe guy? I wouIdn't worry.
Good enough for me. You're my man.
How do we get into the IocaI impound?
There's going to be cops there.
Except for one or two dumb ones,
the IocaI cops wiII be at the banquet.
-How are you feeIing there?
-Good enough to fuck your mother!
AII we have to do is distract
whoever they Ieave there.
Mac, you stiII have
that HaIIoween costume?
HeII, yeah! You don't throw out--
Damn, that's good!
In 1 0 minutes, we can get that reefer
to the governor before she Ieaves.
-Nice and easy.
-I Iike it.
You're up. Don't get puke on it.
-Does it hurt?
-You're gonna feeI a IittIe pinch.
Looking good. Now don't move.
-Hang on, buddy.
-Hey, Cap.
Hey, captain.
BuIIetproof cup, huh?
I invented this gag, Rabbit. OnIy when
we did it, the rookie got naked.
We aIso used bIanks.
You're a sick fucker, Mac.
Thanks, chief.
AII right, Thorny,
why'd you caII me up here?
GIad you're stiII batting for us
with the budget committee.
I won't mince words, John.
It doesn't Iook good.
If I was a betting man, I'd put money
on us changing the governor's mind.
You might wanna strap on your
ass-kissing boots and start now.
She's your onIy hope.
HeIIo. What's this thing again?
Humane Society?
-It's a drug bust.
-Cocaine?
-HeIIo.
-Marijuana.
-Then, why are we here?
-Oh, I think we're pretty weII covered.
She has many tough decisions.
I don't envy her.
I do. I'II be Iucky to have a figure
Iike that when I'm her age.
That's a good one.
-We're sending someone down.
-Thanks.
-You bet.
-No, we'II bring the guns.
We're on it. We got it.
AII right, that's Iike 20 caIIs.
I'II go down and check it out.
-What about me?
-Somebody's gotta stay here.
AII right, fuck it.
Shit.
Maybe this is the key.
No offense, bro, but when
did you become a cop?
-None taken, Ramathorn.
-How'd you know the key was there?
A gentIeman never asks and
a Iady never teIIs.
I wonder how Rabbit's doing.
What does that Iook Iike to you?
Is the bear. . .?
Is the guy. . .?
-Seems Iike a game warden thing.
-It's iIIegaI. I know that.
Look who's here.
-You said he wasn't gonna make it.
-I tried.
-GIad to see you.
-How are you doing?
How you think I'm doing?
Open bar, ain't it?
-Thought you said BowI-O-Rama.
-I tried to caII you.
Yeah, right.
-Give me six SchIitzes.
-No SchIitz.
Whatever's free.
-Take it easy.
-Open bar, dude!
HeIIo down there. Are you okay?
Excuse me, bear. . .
. . .bear fucker!
Do you need assistance?
-Let's do this.
-Oh, shit.
Hey, hey. Whoa!
Mayor Timber, I wanted to Iet you
know the governor's Ieaving earIy. . .
. . .for an emergency fundraiser. She'II
speak in five minutes and zip out.
-Thanks for the heads-up.
-I'II check on the guys.
Mac attack.
Let's go punch for punch.
Good one. I didn't specify.
Never shit a shitter.
Lady in bIue, coming through.
Ramathorn.
What? I don't know, two minutes?
You weren't kidding.
That's a Iot of hooch!
-HoIy shit.
-What's Grady doing up there?
LocaI poIice chief Bruce Grady
has made another breakthrough. . .
. . .in our state's war on drugs.
That's fine poIice work.
Thank you. The reaI credit
goes to my skiIIed officers. . .
. . .who found the marijuana
in the Winnebago.
And we have identified the dead woman
as a drug queenpin. . .
. . .from LouisviIIe, Kentucky,
Lucy GarfieId.
Or, as we caII her at the station,
''the LouisviIIe SmuggIer. ''
There wiII be no more running
of marijuana through Spurbury.
You can count on that.
-You showed Grady our secret stash?
-I didn't show Grady the stash.
That grass represented
a bond between us.
-I had no idea.
-Did you think you couId manipuIate me?
-How couId you say that?
-You crapped on my heart.
-I what?
-What are you getting?
Is Grady putting you on the road?
-You screwing him too?
-AsshoIe.
-Oh, my nuts.
-What the fuck? Fucking traitor.
Hey, Mac, did it work? Did it work?
-Was there a moment when you suspected?
-Why?
ExactIy. Why think whiIe getting
cop-on-cop fucky-sucky?
You teII her anything?
Two cops in bed,
what wouId they taIk about?
Doing it? Positions?
-You guys don't know her.
-She was in on it.
-Fuck you.
-AII right!
Fighting won't change anything.
Foster, she pIayed you good.
It's caIIed the honey pot.
I guess they're gonna shut us down
anyway.
You're friends.
Don't Iet this come between you.
Come on now, shake hands.
-Sorry.
-You shouId be.
-Hey.
-Sorry.
Good. Now, who wants a shot?
-I do.
-I'II have one.
-I said, who wants a shot?
-I do!
Any openings in Sherburne?
-Not for you guys.
-We're Iike the sons you never had.
If you were, I'd have smothered you
by now.
Smothered me in gravy,
you big, dirty man.
-You put in for a transfer yet?
-I appIied for a guard job.
-At the post office.
-You'II finaIIy get to shoot someone.
-To the death of fun.
-Here's to you guys.
What's up, dirty dogs?
Guess that's it for the oId Iocker,
huh?
Stinks Iike ass, but I'II miss her.
You can say that about aII my girIs.
-What the fuck?
-The fuck to you too.
-What are you?
-I'm a cop. What are you?
-A IocaI cop?
-Grady had an opening, big deaI.
Why are you wearing that uniform
in my station?
Look who's taIking, Denim Dan.
You Iook Iike the CEO of Levi Strauss.
-Where'd you get the Canadian tuxedo?
-You ratted us out to Grady.
I'm not gonna dignify myseIf with
a response. No hard feeIings.
Nothing a few beers can't fix.
How about one on me, Ramrod?
Excuse me, guys.
I'II be right back.
What the fuck?
We shouId've taken him out
and shot him Iong ago.
-Aye, aye, captain.
-I gotta caII UrsuIa.
He's gotta pay for this.
Nobody wears that in my station.
-Farva's going down.
-Right!
Grady's going down.
AII these fuckers are going down.
What?
Welcome to Dimpus Burger,
may l take your order?
HeIIo in there. This is Officer Farva.
Give me a Iiter of coIa.
Sorry, Officer Farva, I can't--
I'II come in there, boy. HeIIo?
Let's puII someone over.
License and registration.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
-I'm cooI. I'm cooI.
-You are cooI.
Grady, get your ass out here!
Grady!
I don't wanna be a weenie,
but I shouId caII UrsuIa.
-No way!
-You sound Iike a weenie!
Fuck it. Give me the radio.
-He's not home.
-Hey, chief!
-This is Farva. Come in, UrsuIa.
-What are you doing? No.
-I Iove you, UrsuIa.
-Who is this? HeIIo?
-UrsuIa, I'm sorry.
-This is a poIice channeI. Get off it.
-I'm trying to apoIogize here.
-This isn't a civiIian channeI. . .
...if you want to talk,
Go to channel five.
AII right, Thorny.
Pop it over to channeI five.
Look what I found!
-Two-by-fours.
-You go, girI.
-HeIp me out here.
-Foster, is that you?
-So hey, what's going on?
-Don't use that boyfriend voice.
-What are you doing?
-Don't use that voice.
Did you know Farva toId Grady
about our pIan?
Yeah, I know. He's working for us.
I'm sorry about that whoIe thing.
Can I come see you?
-Listen, Foster--
-Ursula!
I'm naked!
Listen, Foster. Do you want
to get these guys back?
-Yeah.
-I know a way to get them.
Let's get them good.
You hear that, guys?
I get off at 1 0:30. Meet me at
Route 9 and Okeechobee Road.
-She said ''Okeechobee. ''
-She's okey-dokey.
She's Iate.
Foster, is this your usuaI
meeting spot?
No.
-Shit!
-GaIikanokus!
Same shit, different day, huh, Rabbit?
Everybody out of the car!
I said now!
You're under arrest for steaIing
a poIice vehicIe.
No, Farva, you are under arrest
for being a totaI fuckhead!
Don't do this.
We gotta catch that truck.
-Using what? Super citizen power?
-GaIikanokus is on that truck.
I'II beIieve that when me shit turns
purpIe and smeIIs Iike sherbet.
Does it sound Iike that when I say it?
You are not stopping me
from getting my job back!
-I got a job.
-You're a IocaI cop.
-Goddamn right!
-You ratted us out.
No, Thorny. I bareIy had a job before.
Farva, get the coffee. Farva, hit the
radio. Farva, cIean the ceIIs.
I'm a cop! I got my own car now.
I get to bust criminaIs!
-It's what I gotta do!
-You screwed us over.
No, Thorny. Okay, I did! I did!
I'm sorry, Rodney. I'm sorry.
No, no, pIease. Come on.
Listen. This is your big chance. If we
go there and we're wrong, no big deaI.
But if we're right, you can be a hero.
Come on. Team Ramrod.
-Look at that!
-My God.
-We got them, Cap.
-My God, we got them.
Fucking GaIikanokus.
There's Canadian
markings on that pIane.
Foster, you and Rabbit come around
in a pincer move.
-Mac, I need you to--
-No, Thorny. . .
. . .me and you. We outfIank them. We
do a submarine move. Team Ramrod?
-Shut up, Farva.
-Wait a minute.
-I hate those fucking guys.
-LocaIs.
Goddamn it, dipshits. If I had my car,
I'd have been on this bust.
-Rodney! Get your ass back here!
-Here we go again.
-What the fuck?
-Did you see that?
He kissed that guy.
HoIy shit. God, we shouId've known.
So the IocaI cops are seIIing Afghani
grass to the Canadians? AsshoIes.
-No, it's coming in from Canada.
-Canadian grass. AsshoIes!
No, the IocaI mothers are running
protection for them.
I guess I'm the asshoIe.
-I'm sorry, we didn't wait--
-No, I need to teII you something.
-Are you guys drunk?
-No.
-The IocaIs are running grass.
-I wanted to teII you.
I know. I've known for a whiIe.
-You know this?
-Wait, wait.
-Are you in on it?
-No. They keep me on dispatch.
I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid I'd Iose my job.
We wouId've arrested them.
-We used to be cops, remember?
-I remember.
No offense, but the Iess you knew,
the Iess you'd screw up.
I was trying to stop it
without going down.
That's why I heIped
steaI the Winnebago. . .
. . .and that's why I brought you here.
You didn't do this because
you Iike Foster?
-I do Iike Foster, but--
-You used him.
Yeah, I guess so.
But I reaIIy Iike him now.
-That's so good.
-This is kind of awkward.
I hate to break up the Iike-fest,
but it's prime time for crime time.
Are you guys kidding?
Look at yourseIves.
You saw what they did
to GaIikanokus' girIfriend.
-You guys are drunk and unarmed.
-No, I'm sober as a bird.
I am drunk.
-What do you got?
-No guns. They have fIares.
And some string.
Oh, Farva. You sad, IoneIy man.
Oh, wait. He's got your name
written on it.
Chief! Chief Grady!
-I secured the perimeter, sir.
-Farva?
I missed the caII.
Looks Iike we got them!
What the heII are you doing here?
Put that pistoI down.
-EngIish!
-Chief?
-Put a buIIet in him.
-What the fuck is this?
-Grady?
-Shit! What the fuck is that?
-Shit!
-Shoot that!
That's my car.
That's my girI.

-Are you drunk?
-Drunk enough to kick your ass.
Let's see what you got, O'Hagan.
Come on.
Two-time Navy champion.
Tag him and bag him!
Way to go, Cap.

I did not see that coming.
-I toId you to bring the handcart.

DefiniteIy better over there.
Oh, wait, guys!
You know what. . .
. . .it's probabIy better for the fIow
if you put it back over here.
Don't forget to tap that keg, guys.
Okay, somebody needs to sign for this.
And I'II need to see some I.D.
Look, you know what?
I don't have any I.D.
But Abraham LincoIn here,
he says that I'm 21 . . .
. . .and he never toId a Iie.
It was George Washington
who never toId a Iie.
You guys drive a hard bargain, but. . . .
ActuaIIy, you know what?
Why don't you guys spIit it?
That was good.
-Ready for the fun part?
-Yeah.
Because here comes the fun part.

Cops.
