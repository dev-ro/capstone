A stone statue?!
He switched places!
You were careless, Kinshiki.
Rinnegan, eh...
Naruto Uzumaki is my dad.
My dad's not like everyone else.
He's the busiest shinobi
in the village.
In other words,
he's the Seventh Hokage.
SEVENTH HOKAGE
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
You really trashed everything here.
I'm your opponent,
you damn panda!
Huh? That's a bear.
It's a bear that looks like
a vicious panda!
Piece of cake.
It's just an ugly panda!
I said it's a bear,
Boruto, you idiot!
Does that really matter?
What's important now...
is to lure this bear-panda
toward Konohamaru Sensei.
Cha-?!
See? That panda was
a piece of cake!
Leave it to the son of the Seventh
and grandson of the Fourth...
He'll probably become
a Hokage too, huh?
I'm going to be the Hokage!
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu!
The recovery team
will be here soon.
Thank you so much.
Umm... Konohamaru Sensei...
That Jutsu you used earlier...
Wasn't it a Secret Jutsu
of the Nara Clan?
Yeah...
Wow, cool!
Is that the new Ninja Tool
I've heard rumors about?
News reaches you fast, Mitsuki.
It's a prototype from
the Scientific Ninja Tool Team.
Getting data from this
was also part of the mission.
It's an extremely small scroll.
This contains that Jutsu?
This thing can seal ninjutsu.
Shikamaru's Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
was sealed in this.
This is my Rasengan...
I can...
release it like this!
Wow!
That's awesome.
Can anyone use it?
Yeah...
Chakra has nothing to do with it.
I would even go so far as saying
it doesn't take a ninja
to use it either-
Konohamaru Sensei...
Since one's own Chakra isn't involved,
the aim could go a little off
which could pose a problem...
The most important thing is
to communicate properly,
you know?
You're right.
As the Seventh Hokage,
Naruto just said...
That's how our current peace
was established
after the many wars of the past.
But we must never forget that
this peace was made possible
through the sacrifices of
many shinobi.
That's right, you know.
So to ensure that these
fallen shinobi of past wars
did not die in vain,
and to preserve this peace,
SOLD OUT
we must teach the youth,
the next generation, about this.
That's right, you know.
We can't say that the scars left
by this great war
that embroiled five villages
have completely healed.
Through the efforts of
the Seventh Hokage,
the five villages which were once
at odds have become one...
and step by step, they are making
inroads toward progress.
You've got that right, you know.
We are an advanced society of
information and communication,
and we must continue to guard the peace
and prosperity that we have secured.
Now, about the Chunin Exams
which, for the first time,
the five villages have agreed
to sponsor together...
Do you have any words for
the genin who will be taking part?
Just remember these three things!
Teamwork... and perseverance...
That's all.
Good luck to everyone!
That was just two...
Anyway, thank you for
those inspiring words.
We've been bringing this
to you live today.
Hey, Dad, I'm not talking
to a Shadow Clone, am I?
Of course not.
This is the Hokage's office.
And by the way...
Don't call me "Dad" in here.
It's Lord Hokage or Lord Seventh.
So? How'd it go?
Well, it was an easy mission.
I could've done all by myself.
What's important for a shinobi
is teamwork and perseverance.
You must train as a trio-
I didn't even have to train to make
three Shadow Clones of myself.
I know Wind Style, Lightning Style,
and recently, even Water Style...
Konohamaru!
What have you been teaching him?!
Just because you don't know
anything about me,
don't blame my teacher!
You've never even
bothered to watch me!
Forget it.
What's important is-
Never mind that.
You know what important day
this is, don't you?
If you forget my kid sister's birthday,
I'll never forgive you.
Excuse me...
Oh, Katasuke...
As the head of the Scientific
Ninja Tools Team,
I have a request, Lord Seventh.
What is it?
For the upcoming Chunin Exams,
we would like
your authorization to use
the scientific tools developed
by our team!
Then the genin won't have
to go through harsh training...
and they can widen the scope
of their individual ninjutsu!
Their performance will
also be more elaborate.
And if we market them
to other villages,
the outside income will benefit
the Hidden Leaf Village.
No!
The Chunin Exam is not
a performance.
Its purpose is to nurture shinobi.
I see...
I'm sorry I bothered you.
This isn't the lame era
you grew up in, Dad.
Hey, Boruto! Wait!
I was about to give him the application
for the Chunin Exams!
Here you go.
Thanks again!
Don't forget the new software too.
You know I won't...
By the way, Young Lord, are you
taking part in the Chunin Exams?
Nope.
That's a shame...
I'm sure everyone wants
to see your skills.
Especially your father.
The Hokage is in the audience
during the Chunin Exams?
Of course.
BORUTO LEVEL MAX
So you're also a whiz
at video games.
CHUNIN
What do you want, Mitsuki?
I already said I'm not interested.
Konohamaru Sensei
asked us to come.
We need a three-man team
to qualify for the Chunin
Selection Exams.
If you don't apply,
we can't take part.
I don't care.
My dream is to become
the Hokage.
Are you going to destroy
my dream?!
I...
don't wanna be the Hokage!
The Hokage's position
isn't hereditary!
Fine, then you can be
the Hokage.
But stay single for
the rest of your life!
The Hokage is a nuisance
to the people around him!
Boruto, we need a third man too,
or we can't advance...
We don't have a chance of
beating the next boss without you.
Then I'll give you my data.
This one has shortcuts
and is really easy.
Uh, I don't really want that.
It's okay,
someone gave them to me.
DATA TRANSFER COMPLETE
What?
BORUTO MAX LEVEL
Huh? You leaving?
Yeah...
This is only fun because
I have to sneak away
from Mom to play it.
Oh well, I'd better go too...
We should at least have
our applications...
Look, we're a team.
Can we talk about this?
Come on, Boruto.
Let's show Lord Seventh
what we've got!
In these exams!
I'm sure everyone wants
to see your skills.
Especially your father.
Okay already.
You want me to participate?
Fine, I'll participate.
He's so simple.
Oh yeah, Sarada...
ls your dad coming to watch?
Who cares about someone
who couldn't become the Hokage...?
You're wrong.
My dad used to say...
that Uncle Sasuke
is the other Hokage.
He's just being modest!
Sasuke is the only shinobi who could
rival the Seventh Hokage.
That's according to my parent
who's even more awesome
than both of your dads.
What is it?
Oh yeah, who're your parents anyway?
You never told me either.
Well, it's-
Big Brother!
Today's my birthday!
Hurry up and let's go home!
Okay!
Sorry, I've gotta go!
- Hurry, Brother!
- Mom, I'll hold the bags.
Himawari, we're gonna
feast tonight.
So Boruto does know
how to smile.
Uh-huh.
Hey!
So you remembered.
Happy. . birthday to you...
You're a precious person...
And it's your birthday.
Congratulations.
A Shadow Clone...
Boruto!
Boruto!
Let me go, Mom!
Your father has to work hard
for the people of the village.
It doesn't mean he's forgotten
about the two of you!
Why?!
Why did my dad have to be
the Hokage?!
He just sits at his desk all day
and acts bossy!
Anyone can do that!
Being the Hokage is
a difficult job.
It's an indispensable duty,
crucial to the survival of the village,
passed down throughout
the generations.
And the children of the Hokage
are expected to be grateful for
being born into
this stupid situation, huh?!
Oh yeah, I heard our grandpa
was also the Hokage.
And when Dad was a kid,
Grandpa Hokage wasn't
even alive!
So I guess Dad's lucky
he never experienced
the "joy" of having
a parent around.
I know it's sad not to have your father
around on important days.
But it's different with you.
You have a father who's here.
It's not about me...
But Himawari...
Forget it.
Boruto...
I messed up again...
Dad... What am I supposed to do?
Hey, what happened?!
I'll finish up.
You should go home and rest.
It's so dirty... and tattered.
But it's different with you.
You have a father who's here.
This is so uncool!
Could it be?
Is Dad home?
I'm sorry, I thought
you were my dad...
You're Naruto's son?
What's your name?
Boruto Uzumaki...
Is that you, Sasuke?
Is Naruto here?
I think he's still at
the Hokage's office...
I see... Sorry I bothered you.
He's the one
who was Dad's rival...
He's so cool!
What is this?
A gift from Kaguya's Palace.
Sasuke!
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
I can't even read it with
my Rinnegan.
There was also a guy
that worries me.
He didn't follow me though.
Well, I guess I'm not going home.
Let's figure out what
this scroll says.
Oh yeah...
Why do you have it?
I picked it up on the way here.
Oh...
I also met your kid.
He seems just like you
when you were young.
Nah, he's nothing like
how I used to be.
He's a lot more like you
when you were young.
No, I take that back...
He's different from you too.
The clothes he wears...
always look brand-new.
I guess we're just behind the times.
You're wrong.
The soul of a shinobi
remains the same.
That applies to your kid too.
I doubt that...
Anyway, I think I win this contest.
You're one to talk, loser.
He disappeared!
You're amazing!
You used to be my dad's rival, right?
I get it now... brand new, huh?
Please make me your student!
There's someone I want
to bring down, no matter what it takes!
Can you do the Rasengan?
If you can't, you can't be
a student of mine.
That's a piece of cake!
Naruto...
That earlier contest
isn't over and decided yet.
Konohamaru Sensei!
Konohamaru Sensei!
What's all this, eh?
Please teach me your Rasengan!
I have to master it right now!
So you want to learn it
for the Chunin Exams
and shock the Seventh Hokage.
Is that it?
Now you're talking like a shinobi!
Well... yeah.
Imagine me,
the instructor who gets
to pass on this Jutsu
to the Hokage's son!
Oh, Lord Fourth, Lord Seventh...!
I swear! will fulfill this
very important duty!
What happened to
your enthusiasm from earlier?!
Come on, once more.
Watch me carefully,
then you do it like this eh?
I know, I know!
But it's not working at all, eh!
Don't talk like me!
No... "eh" means this!
"Eh" means this in my hand...
Quit saying eh, eh, eh!
Speak for yourself!
And why does it have to be
a water balloon?!
Isn't there a better way
to do this?!
It took Lord Fourth three years
to invent this Jutsu...
and another six months
to perfect it.
Going by how difficult
it is to master,
this is an A-rank Jutsu.
Damn it!
Still no good!
I did it!
Well done!
Okay, on to the next step.
What? A rubber ball this time?!
No! No way... eh!
All right!
UCHIHA
That's awfully small...
I'd be hard-pressed to call
that Rasengan.
But the basics are-
Damn it!
You're always so strict, Dad.
Since you probably
don't know Boruto very well,
let me tell you...
Boruto usually isn't like this.
It's a miracle
he even managed this far.
You get it, don't you?
He jumped to
the wrong conclusion.
I didn't say he failed.
I was going to accept him
as my student...
Special sale, all items 30 to 40% off
and double the points right now!
Damn it.
If you sign up for Hidden Leaf Net,
triple your points!
What's wrong?
I see...
That's terrible.
But I have just the thing for that.
It's cool... smart... and easy to use.
And you'll get exceptionally
good results.
And this is...
what the shinobi of
your generation looks like.
Wouldn't you agree?
Now Young Lord...
Let's choose the ultimate technique
that's perfect for you.
When did I get so filthy?
All right!
Rasengan!
Hey, hey!
So what do you say?
That's all from only one day?
I'm not like my dad...
when it comes to talent.
It seems you're quite different
from Naruto.
I had hoped it wasn't the case.
So? What do you say?
About making me a student?!
Fine... you can be my student.
Tell me about my dad.
When he was a kid, all he did was go
around saying he'd become the Hokage.
He was quite a loser.
A loser?
And stubborn as hell.
No, not that!
I want to know about
my dad's weaknesses, you know!
Weaknesses?
Listen...
He was full of weaknesses.
He was a good-for-nothing.
But he pulled himself up
with his own strength...
and became the Hokage.
You don't need to understand
who Naruto is now.
You need to know the Naruto
who made it all the way here.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's finally time!
Good luck and do your best!
You're awfully lively
this morning, Mom.
Does Dad coming home
after such a long time
make you so happy?
W-What? Don't be silly!
Well, I can tell these things
about you, Mom.
Anyway. I'm off!
You're just as happy, Sarada.
You won the bet with
my dad, Boruto.
W-Well, yeah.
So what will you do now
that you're my dad's student?
I want to learn about
my dad's weaknesses.
I don't mean to criticize you
or anything...
But before you challenge
Lord Seventh...
we have to become Chunin.
Do you understand?
That's why I want to train and
learn from Uncle Sasuke
and show my dad my power
at the Chunin Exams!
The power that's gonna
topple him some day!
It's "our" power!
Really, what are you thinking?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm thinking we're gonna
come out on top
at the Chunin Exams.
CHUNIN
I don't mean to criticize you
or anything...
But sometimes,
you're not that irritating.
Please don't forget about me, okay?
I didn't expect the Chakra was
dispersed in this manner.
The Divine Tree has been cut down,
and there is no sign of Kaguya.
It seems the creatures
of this planet
have gained unnecessary knowledge.
We'll just have to retrieve it
one by one.
Take this!
I'll give that back to you, doubled.
Imagine that...
High-density Chakra in humans
in the form of beasts.
Is that all?
Well, I did use most of the pills
while traveling through Time-Space.
Lord Momoshiki, there is an even
greater reaction to the east.
I believe the massive accumulation
of Chakra that we seek is there.
How's that?
You're able to bend it
a little now.
The next one is that.
How am I supposed
to bend it that far?
Use your head a little and
don't expect an immediate answer.
I know.
You must be victorious,
Boruto, no matter what.
When you're in a bind,
Scientific Ninja Tools will
come to your rescue.
There's no need to think
so hard over it.
Is he even going to try?
Well, he is my son,
so it can't be helped.
We will now begin
the Chunin Selection Exam.
Everyone, this is the time to utilize
everything you've learned so far!
Just watch, stupid old man...
I'm gonna make it to the end
with my strength!
All right, we will begin Round One.
Each team of three will stand
on the side
they believe is the correct answer.
Here is the question!
TRUE OR FALSE THE PASSWORDS IN VOL. 5 ARE: MOON
IS DAY. MOUNTAIN IS RIVER. FLOWER IS NECTAR.
Moon is day.
Mountain is river.
Flower is nectar.
- True or false?
- I don't know that story!
Sarada, do you know the novel?
Sort of...
But I've only read up to Volume 4.
I didn't even know
there was a fifth volume.
Then we may as well give up.
At least give it some thought, Mitsuki.
Boruto, which do you think
my dad would choose?
Probably false.
He's not the conventional type.
But hey, what's this all of a sudden?
I plan to become the Hokage
by choosing a different path
from my dad!
Then we should go for true, right?
Yeah! Let's go, guys!
All right, you've all decided
on your answer.
The wrong answer is...
In other words,
those who turn black will fail.
What do you mean
by "turn black"?
You'll see...
The answer is...
We got it wrong!
Damn it!
Ink! It's a pool of ink!
I get it.
Damn it!
Is it all over?
Over there...
Is that the "false" hole?
This true or false choice
probably has no meaning.
That quiz was a sham
from the start!
There was no volume 5!
Those who fail will turn black...
Those were his words.
So as long as you don't
turn black, you're okay.
It's exactly the kind of awkward
and oblivious test my clad would make.
Precisely!
After seeing the pool of ink
and realizing your mistake,
if you gave up and
let yourself plunge into black ink...
you don't deserve to
become a Chunin.
The real purpose of
the first round was to see
the second answer you were forced
to make instantly after
being driven into a difficult situation...
Whether you gave up or not.
Those who didn't fall into
the ink are correct.
This marks the end of Round One
of the Chunin Selection Exams!
The second round will
begin in three days!
All right!
We did it.
He managed to make it
through, somehow.
Boruto's team made it
through Round One.
O-Oh...
Are you still thinking
about last time?
I'm one to talk, but...
maybe you should give him
a pep talk?
CONGRATULATIONS ON
PASSING THE FIRST ROUND.
GOOD LUCK ON THE NEXT ONE!
DAD.
An email?
He didn't even send
a Shadow Clone?
Stupid old man...
Everyone knows Shuriken Jutsu
is Sarada's specialty!
I mean... she's your...
She's an Uchiha, after all!
According to your reasoning, Boruto...
This Jutsu should be
your specialty too.
I guess so...
This was Dad's specialty, right?
You can't make any more excuses.
Naruto can make over
a thousand Shadow Clones.
I know that!
I'll blow them away
during Round Two!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
I guess four is still my limit.
Round Two consists
of capturing a flag.
Guard the flag in your territory
while you encroach on enemy territory.
Namely, this is an offensive
and defensive battle!
It's three against three so,
half the teams will be dropped
after this round.
Most of the matches are over.
There's just one set of teams left.
I don't see the enemy,
are we okay?
I'm guarding our flag.
So relax and just attack!
We're counting on you, Boruto!
If we're going to show Lord Seventh
how strong we are,
we have to make it through
this second round.
I don't need you to remind me!
Your surprise attack didn't work.
It's five against three.
You know who has
the advantage, don't you?
Who has the advantage now?
Sarada! Go!
I'll rejoin you soon!
Boruto!
There's no water around, but he has
a Water Style this powerful?
He even knows...
Lightning Style?
I'm okay now.
Sarada! Go for the flag!
That's what I'm doing...
We did it!
I guess we managed somehow...
Yeah... It was a piece of cake.
As expected, Boruto...
You're a shinobi who's going
to be the Hokage one day.
Excuse me!
But that's gonna be me!
He's good.
I couldn't even see him
weaving signs.
Leave it to the son
of Lord Seventh...
Okay, that makes four teams.
This round is over.
Thanks, Shino.
You've been a big help.
He got through the second round too.
It seems he used it
this time around.
I see... Did you get footage of it?
Yes.
Next up is the third test!
Yeah...
Boruto!
This means... finally...
Lord Seventh will get to witness
how strong we are!
Can't you be a little more excited?
I-I know!
I knew it.
Your eyes are bluer than
the Seventh's...
Really?
They are! I'm sure of it!
You pay close attention, don't you?
Ask him to show you next time.
Lord Seventh is nice,
so he won't say no.
Uh. yes?
I'm impressed.
About what?
Boruto and his team, of course.
They got through Round Two.
Th-They did, huh?
Well, see you.
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?
Well, it's important news.
By the way, Shikadai's team
made it too.
We just might see a battle
between our sons!
Is it going to take more time
to decipher?
Sorry, looks like they hit a snag.
I see... I'll come back later.
Sasuke...
I hear you're training him.
Did Boruto tell you that?
No, Konohamaru did...
I see.
Maybe you were right...
The soul of a shinobi
remains the same.
I believe that to be true.
I'm home.
Welcome home!
Congratulations, Big Brother!
I just passed Round Two.
It's no big deal, you know!
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.
But I'm tired, so I'm just
going up to my room.
I don't need any dinner, either.
KNOCK BEFORE ENTERING!!
H-Hey, I said I don't need dinner.
What is it?
D-Dad!
I...
I heard you passed
the Second Round.
Y-Yeah.
I... um...
What is it?
If it's nothing, can you go?
You...
You did well.
Well, see you later.
You came up just to say that?
Well, it's important.
It's very important.
Oh, one more thing...
W-What?
Don't lose to Shikadai!
L-Like I'd lose!
I'll be watching.
See you later.
If that's all he had to say,
he could've just emailed.
Stupid old man.
It's time.
Yeah.
I am sure you are all aware...
But Round Three consists
of individual matches!
You will probably face a teammate
who knows your skills.
You will have three matches.
The winners in...
Blocks A, B, and C
will battle in a three-way final.
Are you ready?
- Yes!
- Yes!
BORUTO UZUMAKI
vs. YURUI
Round Three of the Chunin
Selection Exams will now begin.
Challengers, step forward!
Boruto Uzumaki of
the Hidden Leaf and...
Yurui of the Hidden Cloud.
First match, begin!
You're all going down
in one fell swoop.
"One fell swoop"?
It means you're gonna lose!
Then just say it and don't beat
around the bush!
Maybe I'll stop beating around
the bush with this match.
Like I'll let you!
They explode?
You did well.
I'm not gonna...
lose here!
It won't reach all the way here.
How did he bend it that much?
Sorry... but it looks like I took you down
in "one fell swoop."
Um... was it Charai (flashy)?
It's Yurui.
Winner, the Hidden Leaf's
Boruto Uzumaki!
He won! He won!
That kid's good.
All right, I'll win too!
Cha!
Aww yeah!
SARADA TARUI
TOROI MITSUKI
INOJIN YAMANAKA
vs. ARAYA
BORUTO UZUMAKI
vs. SHIKADAI NARA
Seventh match...
Begin!
Shadow Clones?
It would be great if
you gave up soon.
I give up.
Doesn't this scene look familiar?
It'll be our turn to take
the stage soon.
That young fool wields it nicely
without exposing himself.
The winner is Boruto Uzumaki
of the Hidden Leaf!
He moves on to the final!
Yes!
Amazing.
What's the matter, dear?
Hinata... Use your Byakugan
and check out Boruto's hand.
This is what we deciphered
from the scroll.
My suspicions were right
on the mark.
Is something wrong?
We have to let Naruto
know immediately.
Unfortunately, we'll need to
postpone the exams.
Well?
It's some kind of ninja tool...
It seems he had it attached
to his arm...
Is it-?
What's with the Hokage?
He's so proud of his son,
he couldn't stop himself
from going out there?
There's a doting parent for you.
Dad, did you see that?!
Next up is the final round!
What's this about?
This is...
This is prohibited in the Exams.
Using a ninja tool instead
of your own Chakra
defeats the purpose
of the Chunin Exams
which is to nurture new shinobi.
Lee, Boruto Uzumaki
is disqualified.
Please change the winner
to Shikadai Nara.
He's been exposed!
We have no choice
but to act now.
NARUTO UZUMAKI
vs. SHIKADAI NARA
Boruto Uzumaki has
been disqualified
for using an illegal ninja tool!
- He didn't fool around, did he?
- Therefore, the winner is...
- Violating a rule like that.
- Shikadai Nara from the Hidden Leaf.
So this is what it's like...
to have an idiot son who drags
the Hokage's name through the mud.
You're kidding...
When did he get that?
Boruto...
You're disqualified as a ninja.
What happened to Big Brother?
Did he do something bad?
Boruto...
Come with me.
We're in the middle of exams.
We'll talk later.
You'll talk to me later?
Do you have the time, Dad?
If you had lectured me
before all this...
I'd...
I would have... never ended up
in a situation like this!
He's right, you know.
Boruto wasn't able to win,
and we're so disappointed...
Lord Seventh.
To be honest,
I wanted to make this
announcement after he won.
You guys!
Listen, everyone!
Boruto used
a Scientific Ninja Tool!
It was prohibited here...
But, there is no denying that
this Scientific Ninja Tool
made it possible for him
to reach this point!
Katasuke!
That is why, Five Kage and
everyone from the villages...
This was the perfect venue to demonstrate
this amazing Scientific Ninja Tool and-
Get behind me, quick!
Hey, hey!
What's with you guys?!
Don't approach them!
This arena is where
I show off my...
Our top priority is
to prevent any casualties.
I can see the fox with
my Byakugan.
It's dangerous here,
go to where the others are-!
This child is the last one remaining.
Take care of her.
I'm going to check over there.
Sarada!
Dad?!
You don't look like you're hurt.
This is payback for last time!
That was close!
Boruto! Are you all right?
Yeah, what about you?
How trivial.
It was sucked in?!
Kinshiki.
Yes!
We can't use our powers here.
We'll end up dragging
everyone into this.
It seems like I'm their target.
I'll lure them.
Who are you?!
I am Kinshiki Otsutsuki...
This is Lord Momoshiki Otsutsuki.
What do you want with me?
We will turn the scattered Chakra
into one fruit,
and finish what Kaguya failed
to do on this seedbed.
According to the scroll...
It was recorded that these guys would
come to steal the fruit of the Chakra...
That's why Kaguya was amassing
an army of White Zetsu...
First Kaguya, and now this...
What do they plan to do
with the fruit?
They plan on making pills.
Pills?
Medicine.
Precisely. As long as we have this,
we are eternally young,
immortal, and invincible!
You poor, inconvenient humans...
Unless you train and
persevere senselessly,
you get nowhere.
Watch me!
With this pill, instantly,
with no effort, and so easily...
I acquire true power.
Quit kidding around!
That's not true power!
Vulgar creatures like you
wouldn't understand...
What will you do?
I didn't want to soil my garments,
but I shall do it anyway.
I'll have to rearrange this seedbed
and make it beautiful anyway.
There's also the Jutsu I acquired earlier.
No...
It's meaningless.
What is this?
I didn't know
Dad had power like this...
Here!
Here!
If the real you goes down,
it's all over!
Thanks, Sasuke.
Naruto...
It will all be over after this.
But you must not die, Fox.
Sasuke... Take care of them both.
I got it.
- Uncle!
- Dad!
Let's do this, Kurama!
You'd better not be out of shape!
Don't be stupid!
I'm ready to go anytime!
Right!
Listen...
He was full of weaknesses.
He was a good-for-nothing.
But he pulled himself up
with his own strength...
and became the Hokage.
You don't need to understand
who Naruto is now.
You need to know the Naruto
who made it all the way here.
Dad!
You're awake.
Is this the hospital?
Everyone's been
transported here.
Lord Seventh protected us all.
I see.
So everyone's safe?
Mama!
Himawari?!
Hinata!
It's me. Can you hear me?
Mom!
It's all right. She'll be okay.
What happened, Mom?!
She charged after him.
Why'd she do something
crazy like that?!
She tried to get Naruto back...
SEVENTH
Boruto...
Boruto...
And when Dad was a kid,
Grandpa Hokage wasn't even alive!
So I guess Dad's lucky
he never experienced
the "joy" of having
a parent around!
Why does my dad have
to be the Hokage?!
He just sits at his desk all day
and acts bossy!
Anyone can do that!
I am...
so uncool.
You've got that right.
At the Exams,
everyone scorned you.
You were stripped of
your headband
and you can't even call yourself
a shinobi right now.
On top of that,
you made your little sister cry,
your mother's been hurt,
and your father is gone.
If it weren't for your sister
who adores you
and your mother who worries
so much about you...
you'd be in the same situation
your dad used to be in the past.
So, what are you going to do?
My dad...
How did my dad do it?
Seems you're not just interested
in his weaknesses anymore.
Ask Naruto yourself.
I'm going to rescue him.
I can sense his Chakra.
In other words,
he's not dead yet.
Uncle Sasuke,
why do you bother with me?
You're actually
a very strong shinobi.
I lost to him...
but you can become someone
who surpasses him.
How can you tell?
You're his son,
and you're my number one student, right?
And besides,
you're a bigger loser
than Naruto ever was.
A loser, does that mean...?
I mean, you hate to lose.
Aren't you forgetting about us?
We can't ignore the Hokage
and disgrace the reputations
of the Five Kage.
Let's do it!
Wow... The Five Kage...
This feels just like the old days
with Naruto...
I feel my power surging.
No, there's still something missing.
This is...
With this Rinnegan,
the number of shinobi
I can send after them is limited.
Considering our present
battle strength,
this is the best we can do.
Take care of Naruto.
Boruto!
Mom!
Boruto...
I'm gonna go.
You're finally carrying yourself
like a shinobi...
Let's go!
Sarada, Mitsuki...
Take care of everyone!
Boruto...
Take care of your father.
It's them!
This is taking too long.
Sorry about that.
You see... We ninja...
don't like to make things easy.
Let's do this!
Don't think you can
get away from us.
Vulgar creatures!
Sasuke...
And you too?
Why are you wearing that?
Things happened...
And well, he's become a shinobi.
I feel like I'm looking at
my own Shadow Clone.
Do I look a little cool at least?
More than before.
So you were keeping
an eye on me a little.
I'm sorry...
for everything up until now.
From now on-
It's fine the way it was.
But, when you can manage
to be around, instead of lecturing me...
I want you to tell me stories
about your past.
Sure...
You're cornered.
Aren't you talking about yourself?
You impudent-!
Honenuki: Bone Mutilation!
Kurotsuchi!
Ash Stone Sealing Jutsu!
We'll hold him here!
Sorry we're late!
Naruto!
Don't use ninjutsu on them!
You can absorb Jutsu,
and then release it... right?
It's the same set-up as those toys
from the Scientific Ninja Tools Team.
Then we'll go with taijutsu.
That's a simple deduction.
Lord Momoshiki...
Now, Lord Momoshiki.
It seems the time has come
to consume my Chakra.
Just as in the past,
when my guardian entrusted me
with their power...
Do not waver.
Like I would!
It's like I'm looking at the old me.
No kidding.
Let's teach him a lesson... Sasuke!
Yeah!
Amazing...!
Make sure you get the power of
this Scientific Ninja Tool on camera!
Right!
Take this!
This is payback for what
you did to me earlier!
There they go again, interfering...
Them again!
You have my thanks, fools!
My Chakra...
This is a fine ability...
Now, I'll be careful with you.
I won't kill the fox.
But the rest are nuisances.
Now's the time!
Remember what I said...
Now release your Rasengan!
Can I really...?
Trust your master.
That's why
I brought you here with me.
Rasengan?!
Go!
What?!
What just happened?
What is the meaning of this?
When did you learn the Rasengan?!
Do you know how hard
it is to perfect?
But this Rasengan adds
a sudden Change in Chakra Nature,
then disappears.
I see!
Boruto, do it again.
But my Rasengan's...
Just do as Sasuke says...
O-Okay!
You dare to soil my garments twice...
What did he have to go through...
to get to this point...?
I don't feel like losing...
I can make
an endless number of those!
We've got only one chance.
Got it?
Let's go!
Right!
There's no second chance.
The rest is up to you...
Boruto!
Why you-!
What have you done?!
Go, Boruto.
Rasengan!
You're a wreck.
So are you...
Yeah... I can barely stand.
I won this contest.
The soul of a shinobi
remains the same...
Even for your kid.
Boruto...
You're right.
The situation's different from
the time my dad was the Fourth...
I'm the Hokage who's present,
right now.
And I'll be here
to watch over you...
as you grow up.
It's okay, Mom...
You can leave it.
It looks cool like that.

GAME OVER
BORUTO LEVEL ONE
Mom, my jacket.
I have to go now.
How are you doing on time, Dad?
Oh, yeah.
Papa, your lunch!
Oops.
Thank you, Himawari
Oh no, Boruto forgot too.
I'm off!
I'll be going now!
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.
Boruto, are you off on a mission?
Yeah. Do your best at work, Dad!
Got it!
What's important is to study hard
and learn, you know?
So although you're still a genin,
that's how you fought
alongside the Five Kage
and helped save us from danger?
What's the most important thing
for a shinobi?
Teamwork and perseverance!
Oh, how wonderful!
My dad said...
It's not up here that counts...
It's what you know and feel here.
I see.
Finally, any thoughts
on the resumption
of the Chunin Selection Exams?
I'm gonna make it this time,
you know!
This has been a live broadcast.
A Shadow Clone?
I hope you're the real one.
Of course!
You've been busy with all
those television interviews.
Even though you cheated.
How many times have I
apologized for that?
Give me a break already!
A panda's escaped from the zoo!
No, that's a bear!
Anyway, it's headed your way.
Roger that!
Not again... eh?
I'll be the decoy,
so you guys capture it.
- Roger!
- Right!
Do it right this time, you two.
Boruto, you're the son of
the Seventh Hokage
and the grandson
of the Fourth Hokage-
Hey, Boruto...
Deep down inside, don't you want
to become the Hokage too?
Me, the Hokage?
I don't want to!
But... when you become
the Hokage,
I'll be your right-hand man.
I'll guard you well!
To me,
the Hokage is just a path.
Just because my grandpa
and dad are Hokage
doesn't mean I have to walk
the same path.
Sarada...
What I'm really aiming for
is to become a shinobi
like your dad.
I'm going to follow
my own Ninja Way!
All right, here it comes.
Let's do this, Boruto! Mitsuki!
- Right!
- Okay!
At any time, even now,
we'll achieve our goal
Even now, we fly off on our way
When the sun rises once again,
I'll take a step forward
I'm supposed to be different
from yesterday
I wonder why they don't notice?
Dissatisfaction grows in my heart
There are so many things
I've never seen,
So many things I've never heard
But reflected in these blue eyes...
At any time, even now,
that shadow running in the distance
I'm not just waiting around either
At any time, even now,
we'll achieve our goal
Even now, we fly off on our way
I stomped my feet,
wanting to be acknowledged
Because I'm so frustrated
I can't put it into words
The more I wish to become stronger
The more it seems like
I'm grabbing at straws
I act strong and keep acting like
I'm strong, like there's nothing I fear
I laugh and pretend,
unable to say how I really feel
Then I get tired of it and
feel irritated and useless
And I think, "what's the point,"
and stop.
I don't have the guts, but I hate
to lose and the tears fall again
I'm in a whirlpool of
never ending anxiety and conflict
And before I know it,
the sun's already set
Come rain or wind,
I'll face it and push on
I know I can do it,
and dive into my way
At any time, even now,
we'll achieve our goal
Can you see me,
flying off on my way?
Even if it got filthy and torn,
it was something I wanted
And now, it's right here.
Like I said, it's a bear!
Ugh! Shut up, shut up!
I'm saying it's a panda!
- It's a bear, a bear!
- Panda!
Bear!
- You guys sure get along well.
- Panda! - Bear!
It would be nice if you could show
my parent some respect too.
Oh yeah, speaking of which...
Who is it?
Huh? Didn't I tell you?
He's called Orochimaru.
Who?
You mean... You're the child of
that Orochimaru?
So, is he your dad? Or your mom?
Well, that doesn't really matter...
So who is this Orochimaru?
And what do you mean
by "that doesn't matter"?
I don't get it!
