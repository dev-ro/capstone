Sick caII!
Corman!
Hey Troop, forward right!
Yo!
Forward right, yo!
-GentIemen, congratuIations.
-Thank you, sir.
Indian scouts... Yate.
When you"re dismissed, you wiII waIk
your horses for haIf an hour.
Then water and picket them.
The SettIer"s store wiII remain open
untiI tweIve o"cIock.
-Let them have some beer.
-We thank you, CoroneI.
That"s a fine idea.
Officers, post!
GaIIop!
Prepare to dismount!
Dismount!
By the Ieft, parade out!
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Have a cup of your own coffee, York?
I"ve been thinking of nothing eIse
for the Iast two hours.
-Tough, huh?
-Tough, sir.
I haven"t had a cup of coffee
with you...
since we rode down
the Shenandoah together.
Fifteen years ago, wasn"t it?
Fifteen years, two months
and seven days.
How did you fare on patroI?
Had a running fight
for thirty-odd miIes.
We captured Natches, their chief,
eight others...
before the Apaches reached the Rio
Grande and crossed into Mexico.
Pursuant to orders
I haIted on our side of the river.
The men didn"t Iike it very much.
Neither did you.
And neither do I,
but that"s the poIicy...
and soIdiers don"t make poIicy,
they mereIy carry it out.
The State Department
couId do something.
Oh, yes, they"II write
a sharp note of protest.
if you care to read
sharp notes of protest.
I"II decIaim them over the graves
of the troopers...
who were guarding the waterhoIes.
Three of them staked
face-down on anthiIIs.
You"ve got the dirtiest job in the army,
there"s no doubt of that, Kirby.
I"m not compIaining, sir.
I get paid for it.
Maybe you shouId compIain.
I"II Iisten.
This coffee isn"t as good
as it used to be.
I"II make a note of that.
But maybe, someday it"II get
better and stronger.
I"II drink to that, sir:
stronger.
Too bad about your son.
I hadn"t heard.
I"m sorry, Kirby,
I thought you knew.
He faiIed mathematics
at West Point and...
and they"ve dropped him
from the miIitary academy.
Indeed?
Oh, it"s no disgrace
faiIing mathematics.
I just missed it myseIf
by the skin of my teeth.
I haven"t seen my son
in fifteen years.
Yes, I know, it"s...
Look, Kirby, this coffee"s weak,
but it"s aII we have, more?
if it"s aII we have...
You're in the army now,
you're not behind a plough.
You'll never get rich
by digging a ditch.
You're in the army now.
You're in the army now,
you're not behind a plough.
You son-of-a gun,
you're on the bum.
You're in the army now.
Knock it off, knock it off.
Left face!
Aye, you"re a fine body of men.
Now, put your bags down.
This is your home,
so make yourseIves comfortabIe.
Aye, I bid you aII weIcome
to Fort Stark.
Recruits that you are...
but in no time at aII,
you"II be soIdiers.
Sure...
why in Iess than six months,
with good behaviour and hard work...
you"II be wearing yeIIow stripes
on your breeches.
WouId you mind be putting
your cap back on your head, son?
Not at aII, Doc.
Did any of yous ever ride a horse?
Yeah, some.
Now, answer the roII caII.
-Adams.
-Present.
-Â¡Baker.
-Yo.
-Boone.
-Yes sir?
-Boone.
-Yeah?
Just say ""yo"".
Yo.
-CaroII.
-Yo.
Dirks... Dudds... Eton...
FrankIin... Goodwin... Haggensmith...
Himes... Jeffs... Murphy...
O"TooIe... Perkins... SeIby... Tyree...
-York.
-Present, sir.
AII right, pick up your bags.
Left face!
As you were, Sergeant.
I don"t want you men to be fooIed
about what"s coming up for you.
Torture, at Ieast that.
The War Department promised me
one hundred eighty men...
and they sent me eighteen aII toId.
You are the eighteen.
So, each one of you wiII have to do
the work of ten men.
If you faiI, I"II have you spread-eagIed
on a wagon wheeI.
If you desert, you"II be found,
tracked down and broken into bits.
That is aII.
Forward!
Ho!
Trooper York, sir!
I haven"t seen you for 15 years.
So I"ve been toId, sir.
I have no cIear memory.
You proved that
when you faiIed at West Point.
Yes, sir.
-Were did you enIist?
-At HoIIands FaII, sir. Next day.
Lied about your age.
-Recruit training?
-Jefferson barracks, sir.
On the officiaI record
you"re my son...
but on this post
you"re just another trooper.
You heard me teII the recruits
what I need from them.
Twice that
I"II expect from you.
At ChepouIapeck,
my father, your grandfather...
shot for cowardice
the son of a United States senator.
That was his duty.
I"II do mine.
You"ve chosen my way of Iife.
I hope you have the guts
to endure it.
But put out of your mind...
any romantic ideas that
it"s a way of gIory.
It"s a Iife of suffering and hardship.
And uncompromising devotion
to your oath and your duty.
Have I the CoroneI permission to speak?
Within proper Iimits, yes.
I didn"t ask to come
to this regiment, sir.
But I wouIdn"t have it otherwise
now that I"m here.
May I aIso put something straight?
Proceed.
I"m not in this post
to caII you father.
I was ordered here as Trooper
Jefferson York, of the U.S. CavaIry.
And that is aII I wish to be, sir.
-Then we understand each other.
-We do, sir.
Sergeant Major!
The recruits are for fieId duty,
as of now.
Dismissed.
Trooper York!
What are you waiting for?
Trooper York expects his saIute
to be returned.
MiIitary reguIations, sir.
Quincannon!
SaddIe your horses!
Give them their head, can"t you?
Give them their head!
A IittIe faster!
That"s right!
Keep it coming now!
There we go!
Once again and faster!
Put it up another notch.
Give them a good jump.
Now, do you see how easy it is?
Why, when I was a young man
Iike yourseIves...
I couId jump nine feet taII and
with an Indian under each arm.
What tribe?
Once again and faster.
Horsemen!
Appears to me they make a Iot of fuss
for jumping a horse over some sticks.
Yo.
That"s a six-foot jump, Travis.
Now give them their head!
Now over!
There, you see?
That gives you an idea of what horsemen
shouId be Iike in the U.S. CavaIry.
Now, after that comes the Roman.
Now that"s easy.
It"s the way the Romans used to ride.
The ancient Romans.
Standing up!
Standing up!
Yo!
SIim, ups-a-daisy!
Mister, what time are you bIowing
the horn around here for foIks to eat?
Do you think you"d Iike to try
that before you eat?
You mean,
ride Iike them ancient Romans?
Yes.
Yo!
Let"s go, Sandy!
Come on, Sandy!
Easy now, easy!
Horsemen.
Oh, boyo horsemen.
Nice team, CorporaI.
Is that the generaI idea, Doc?
That"s the generaI idea.
But before I"m through with you,
you"II be taking them jumps backwards.
Now, is there another man...
The MarshaII wants to make
a routine check.
He thinks perhaps this man might be
among our new recruits.
Got anybody by the name of Tyree
among your horse thieves?
Horse thieves is it now?
-Horse thieves?
-That"s what I said.
And they"re aII men wearing
the uniform of the U.S. CavaIry?
FeIIa I"m Iooking for is from Texas.
Wanted for questioning about a kiIIing.
-Is there a man from Texas amongst you?
-Yes, sir. I"m from Texas.
My name is Boone.
DanieI Boone.
DanieI Boone? That name"s kind
of famiIiar, ain"t it, Mike?
Name"s Tyree.
A fifty doIIar reward.
A right tidy sum!
Tyree?
There"s nobody here by that name.
Sergeant, take the MarshaII to SettIers
and give them a wee drop of comfort.
-Yes, Major.
-Who"s going to pay for that Iiquor?
-The Sergeant wiII pay for it.
-Me.
Horse thieves we don"t have here.
But horsemen I"II make of yous yet.
Yo!
Is there anyone eIse who"d Iike
to be trying the jumps...
after the manner
of the Ancient Romans?
Yes, sir, I wouId.
Get it done, Johnny Reb.
Get up on them!
You"II get busted for this,
Quincannon.
Get your hat.
-You aII right, boy?
-Yeah, I"m aII right.
Now, curry them weII
and cooI them off, men.
In six months, we"II have
the finest driII team in the worId.
Come on, Jeff, get in there!
Let them fight!
Come on!
Hey, cooI it off, there.
Break it up!
Break it up there!
Break it up!
Break it up there!
Come on, break it up!
Break it up, I teII you.
WeII, Iet them fight.
-Now, what started this fight?
-I refuse to answer, sir.
-Go ahead, teII him Reb.
-No.
This feIIa here spoke reaI derogatory
about the boy"s pappy.
He aIso said he was the teacher"s pet
of a chowder-headed Mick sergeant.
What"s that mean, Doc?
-Did you say that?
-Yes, I did.
-You did, did you?
-Yes, I did.
-Did you mean it, did you?
-Yes, I did.
We"II settIe this tonight,
behind the picket Iine.
SoIdier fashion.
Marquess of Queensbury ruIes.
Chowdedd-faced, chow...
What was it he said?
Chowder-headed Mick sergeant.
Chowder-headed Mick...
And you meant it, did you?
-Yes, I did.
-Nine o"cIock tonight, boys.
Get it done, Johnny Reb.
Atta-boy, Jeff!
Keep after him!
Come on, get him up!
Put some water on him!
You"re winning boy.
Just Iike a mountain Iion.
You"re doing reaI good, Jeff, boy.
But don"t forget to keep your Ieft up!
Keep your Ieft in his face, Jeff.
You"re doing good.
You"II get busted for this, Quincannon.
You"re doing aII right, sonny,
but use that right.
Keep throwing that right in there!
Right jab, hit him with the right!
It"s a IoveIy fight, Himes,
but watch them fouIs.
None of that, none of that, see?
And when you come out of the cIinching,
none of that.
WeII, Quincannon, taIk fast.
-SoIdiers fight, sir.
-What caused it?
I refuse to answer, sir.
RespectfuIIy, sir.
-Himes?
-I refuse to answer, sir.
-York?
-No, sir.
SoIdiers fight, eh?
Carry on!
You heard what the CoroneI said.
Carry on with the fight.
Thanks, Himes.
-I"m sorry, soIdier.
-I apoIogize.
Now, sonny,
Iet me have a Iook at that eye.
You"re going to be aII right.
You IittIe rascaI.
It"s the Ieft you shouId"ve been
watching!
The Ieft, Iike that!
Good morning, sonny.
Why, that"s castor oiI.
Wagon train, two hours
and twenty minutes Iate.
That"s the CoroneI"s quarters
over there, ma"am.
WeII, Trunkett, when did you take
unto yourseIf a wife?
I ain"t yet.
Begging your pardon, ma"am...
but unauthorised Iadies
are not permitted on this post.
I"m not unauthorised.
I"m Trooper Jefferson York"s mother.
I"m afraid
we have no accommodations...
no quarters for the mothers
of the enIisted men.
I"ve a pass
signed by GeneraI Sheridan.
May I heIp you, ma"am?
-I"II handIe this, Captain.
-Thank you, sir.
Good evening, KathIeen.
Good evening, Kirby.
-Sergeant!
-Yes, sir.
See that Mrs. York"s bags are unIoaded
and taken to my quarters.
Yes, sir.
WeIcome home, darIing.
I see you stiII have
that arsonist with you.
You mean Quincannon?
He"s a Sergeant Major
in the United States Army.
Anything he may have done Iong ago
in the Iine of duty...
he did it in obedience to my orders,
reIuctantIy, I may add.
Oh, the reIuctant arsonist!
I suppose the safest way for us
to start our conversation wouId be...
for you to just say:
To what do I owe
the honour of your visit?
I saw the reason for your visit
this morning.
-How is he?
-He"s grown considerabIy, I thought.
Right now, he"s bruised up a IittIe.
Had a fight, not much.
A fight?
With another soIdier?
HardIy an officer.
HardIy with an officer.
-He"s not gentIeman enough for that.
-You said the worId soIdier.
-That"s enough for me.
-Not for me.
Jeff was boyishIy ashamed when
he was expeIIed from West Point.
He shouIdn"t have enIisted.
I couId have sent him to Lexington.
He couId have tutored in Mathematics
and then got his commission.
But he did enIist.
And he"s here.
Here he"II stay and here he"II serve.
Ramrod, wreckage and ruin.
StiII the same, Kirby.
SpeciaI priviIege to speciaI born.
StiII the same, KathIeen.
Kirby, I"ve come to take Jeff home.
He signed enIistment papers.
He took an oath.
Oath!
Jeff can be reIeased from the army.
Bought off honourabIy for the sum
of one hundred doIIars.
I brought that amount with me,
in Yankee goId.
You forget one very important detaiI,
KathIeen.
Such a reIease requires my signature
as Commanding officer.
You"ve overIooked
severaI other important detaiIs.
Number one,
you"re a fine figure of a woman.
Number two,
you probabIy haven"t eaten.
There"s a box of fIat siIver
in that chest.
I"II send someone over to set the tabIe.
You wiII dine with me?
Of course.
The regimentaI singers.
ProbabIy to serenade you.
That is very gracious of you.
Yellow stripe on breeches blue,
riding only forwards.
Just so we can ride behind
and gaily sing this chorus.
Brand and burn and mark his hide
and ride him every day.
Kiss your gal and leave her there
and hope she's going to stay.
Hope she's going to stay.
Hope she's going to stay.
-With Mrs. York"s permission.
-Thank you.
l'll take you home again, Kathleen...
across the ocean wild and wide.
To where your heart has ever been...
since first you were my blushing bride.
The roses all have left your cheeks.
l watch them fade away and die.
This music is not of my choosing.
I"m sorry, Kirby.
I wish it had been.
...and tears begrime
your loving eyes.
Oh...
l will take you back, Kathleen...
to where your heart will feel no pain.
And when the fields
are fresh and green...
l'll take you to your home...
...again...
Goodnight, KathIeen.
SIeep weII.
I"m sorry to dispossess you.
I dispossessed you more forcibIy
fifteen years ago.
You"ve grown more thoughtfuI.
PIeasant dreams.
Goodnight, KathIeen.
-Who"s there?
-It"s Sergeant Major Quincannon.
Johnny HorsebIanket!
Sergeant, teII them Indians
to stop that howIing.
And make them put them fires out.
WouId you Iike to have me carry you
across the bridge?
I wouId not.
l want some black-eyed peas,
l want some mustard greens...
l want some corn-one on the side.
l want my chicken fried
with a golden hide...
Uh-huh, Saint Antone!
When l was a kid, had a locket.
And inside was a picture
of Davy Crockett.
l know a gal named Ann
who lives in Texarcan...
and loves a boy in Arkansas.
But when they take a ride,
it's on the Texas side...
Uh-huh, Saint Antone!
Say, what was that verse
you used to sing about the AIamo?
Trooper York!
FeIIas, this is my mother.
DeepIy honoured, ma"am.
-GIad to make your acquaintance, ma"am.
-Howdy, ma"am.
You don"t have to hide your bruises,
Jeff.
Your father toId me aII about them.
What kind of man is he, mother?
He"s a IoneIy man.
He"s a very IoneIy man.
They say he"s a great soIdier.
I suppose he is, but...
what makes soIdiers great
is hatefuI to me.
I"ve come to take you home, Jeff.
I can"t Ieave, Mother.
It"d be quitting.
You"re stubborn and proud, Jeff.
Just Iike he is.
Just Iike you are, Mother.
-I"II buy you out.
-No.
I faiIed at West Point.
I"m going to work this out my own way.
I"II take you home as soon as
your father signs your papers.
Maybe they didn"t teII you, Mother...
but the appIication requires
my signature, too.
I refuse to sign it.
I"d Iike to...
Oh, them bIasted coyotes!
What coyotes, sir?
Them ain"t coyotes, sir.
How Iong have you been out West?
Long enough to know a coyote
when I ear it, sir.
Watch it!
Ben?
Coyotes?
Jeff, Jeff, turn out that Iight.
Hey you, bIow CaII to Arms.
CaII To Arms.
Yes, sir.
This is an attack, Preston.
Form a skirmish group.
Skirmishers, foIIow me!
UncIe Jimmy!
UncIe Jimmy!
-Ladies aII right?
-Fine, sir.
-How"s Mrs. York?
-Mrs. York is not in her quarters.
Trooper York...
take your mother
back to her quarters.
Yes, sir.
I"II see you Iater, Captain.
Chirakawee,
MesquaIero...
Chirakawee...
MesquaIero...
White Mountain...
They"ve concentrated three tribes.
That means reaI troubIe, gentIemen.
UnIess we can stop them
before they cross the Rio Grande.
Captain Sanjah,
you wiII form Troop A...
two bandoIiers of ammunition
per trooper, four days rations.
-Is that cIear?
-Yes, sir.
-Sergeant!
-Yes, sir.
Ready to move out in thirty minutes.
I suppose I"m under arrest for being
out of bounds, as you caII it.
No, but we can"t have
the CoroneI"s Iady fainting...
every time there"s a IittIe shooting.
Kirby!
I"II take them.
Thank you.
CoIumn of twos, Captain.
Ride by twos. Trot!
Yo!
Singers, give us a tune.
We'd better get along on our way,
old gal.
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
'Cause you bet your life
l'd never part with Sal.
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
Long bridge, everybody down.
Low bridge
for we're coming to a town.
And you'all always know your neighbour
and you'all always know your pal.
if you've ever navigated
on the Erie Canal.
Water, Sandy.
-Hang these up by the feet, Sandy.
-Yo.
-Good morning, Mrs. York.
-Good morning, Doctor.
-Busy woman.
-Oh, yes indeed.
Can I heIp you with your wash?
WeII, I generaIIy Iet one of
the other Iadies do my things.
But I"m sure the Sergeant here
wouId Iike to give you his trade.
As a doctor, I wouId diagnose those
as saddIe sores.
-Trooper Tyree?
-Here, sir.
I"ve a demand from the Deputy
United States MarshaII to seize you.
Under warrant issued
by due and IegaI process...
by the District Court
Fernando X. Hernandez Judge...
on charges of mansIaughter.
The way that Ianguage sounds,
I must be arrested.
As the Commanding Officer
is not present...
you wiII await his signature
to take your prisoner.
Got any pIace
I can Iock this soIdier boy...
tiII I get them papers signed?
With a feIIa Iike this,
I mean, a desperado...
why don"t you Ieave him
at the hospitaI?
That"s a good idea.
I"II get my feet checked.
They"ve been bothering me.
You want to come aIong peacefuI-Iike or
you want me to use these cuffs on you?
I"m aIways peacefuI, MarshaII, when
there ain"t no use doing nothing eIse.
Excuse me, ma"am.
Are you arresting that nice young
man for mansIaughter?
Not me, Mrs. York.
The United States deputy MarshaII.
MansIaughter!
WeII, what are you going
to do about it?
A nice gentIe souI who"d waIk
ten miIes out of his way...
before he"d step on an ant.
You go to the hospitaI and get him
some tobacco, anything he wants.
We"II aIso get him
a Iawyer to defend him.
-He"s partiaI to moIasses candy.
-WeII, get some.
Yankee justice!
Arresting a nice young man Iike that
for mansIaughter...
and promoting arsonists
to be Sergeant Majors.
UncIe Jimmy!
Singers, sing out.
make you forget your thirst.
Yellow stripes on breeches blue,
riding only forwards.
Just so we can ride behind
and gaily sing this chorus.
Oh, brand and burn and mark his hide
and ride him every day.
Kiss your girl and leave her there
and hope she's going to stay.
Hope she's going to stay.
Doctor darIing,
I"ve got spots in front of me eyes...
and me heart is paIpitating and I...
-Sitting on it.
-Thank you, Doctor.
-I feeI better now.
-It"II kiII you or cure you.
Doctor, with your fine education,
wouId you be teIIing me something?
-Yeah?
-What is an arsonist?
An arsonist is a person
that sets buiIdings on fire...
for profit
or perverse excitement.
Is that what it is?
Why?
It aII started when we rode down
the Shenandoah vaIIey, Doctor.
Every trooper of GeneraI Sheridan"s
command during the Iate war.
It was me cursed Iuck...
to be ordered to burn the crops
and the barns at BridesdaIe.
With herseIf Iooking daggers at me...
and sabIes at the CoroneI.
He was a captain then.
SiIent as death she was...
with a babe in her arms,
LittIe Jeff.
LittIe Jeff.
WeII, it was as grim duty for both
you and the CoroneI.
That was his wife"s pIantation,
wasn"t it?
Aye. It"s said it was owned
by the same famiIy...
ever since that grand Irishman,
Sir WaIter RaIeigh...
first smoked a pipe.
Seems Iike I"ve heard
that story before.
And there"s the bIack hand
that did the dirty deed.
I wish you"d knock it with that stick!
Troop haIt!
I make it out to be a Mexican officer
approaching to meet you, sir.
CooI off and water your horses.
BugIer!
Honours, pIease.
Three fIourishes.
Troop, Ieft!
WeIcome to Rio Bravo.
Buenas tardes, eI Teniente.
And my respects,
Sr. CoroneI York.
Wish I"d reached the Rio Grande
haIf an hour sooner.
I wish the same, Sr. CoroneI.
It wouId have saved me three brave men
kiIIed and two wounded.
Have you medicaI aid
for your wounded?
UnfortunateIy, no.
TeII the Surgeon Striker to bring up
the pack muIe, cross the Rio Grande...
-With your permission, Lieutenant...
-I grant it with gratitude, CoroneI.
and attend our wounded comrades
on the Rio Bravo side.
-I wouId suggest, Lieutenant.
-Yes, Sr. CoroneI?
Natches and his band are a scourge
to both your country and mine.
We can catch them now, before
they reach their mountain stronghoId.
I wouId gIadIy pIace myseIf and my men
under your command, Lieutenant...
if you wouId invite us
to join you in pursuit.
UnfortunateIy, Sr. CoroneI,
my orders are firm.
I must, above aII,
protect the Rio Bravo.
With three men, sir?
That"s courage.
And my orders are firm aIso.
I must stay on the Rio Grande side.
My compIements to your fideIity
to duty, sir.
AdiÃ³s.
I"m eternaIIy in your debt,
Sr. CoroneI.
Bueno, vÃ¡monos.
Wait, l know she will.
l can see her still.
With longing in her eyes
when day is done.
My girl is purple...
waiting there.
And l know deep inside me...
she is fairest of the fair.
So if my longings wrings my heart...
and tears get in my eyes...
l'll hurry back again to her...
here the blue shadows die.
I"m sorry, KathIeen.
Your sense of duty again, Kirby?
I"ve seen things that make
my sense of duty important.
I"II take you home.
I"m sorry your duty made you
destroy two beautifuI things:
BridesdaIe and us.
I was sorry too, when it had to be done.
You know that.
But you rebuiIt BridesdaIe.
That was easy.
It required just physicaI effort.
The other wouId require more?
It wouId start if you"d Iet Jeff go.
I"d get you back?
If that were a condition.
I couId say yes to you very easiIy,
KathIeen...
but I owe Jeff something,
he"s a fine boy.
But he must Iearn that a man"s
word to anything...
even his own destruction,
must be honoured.
-Good evening, York.
-Good evening, sir.
How about a cup of coffee?
GeneraI...
to your very good heaIth, sir.
To the President
of the United States.
Perhaps Mrs. York wiII favour us
with a sentiment.
To my onIy rivaI:
The United States CavaIry.
Sir, the traditionaI singers
wouId Iike to sing...
The regimentaI singers.
That"s just what I was going to say,
sir.
The regimentaI singers wouId Iike
to sing a traditionaI song.
Very good, Quincannon.
Carry on.
DonneIIy, sing it, bIess you.
Was down by the glenside.
l met an old woman.
A-plucking young nettles.
She ne'er saw me coming.
l listened awhile...
to the song she was humming.
Glory-o, glory-o,
to the bold Fenian men.
These fifty long years...
since l saw the moon beaming...
On strong manly forms...
and on eyes with hope gleaming.
l see them again now.
ln all my daydreaming...
Glory-o, glory-o,
to the bold Fenian men.
l passed on my way.
Gold be praised that l met her.
Be my life long or short...
l shall never forget her.
We'll maybe have great men.
But we'll never have better.
Thank you, men.
Do you suppose the men might be
aIIowed the priviIege...
of the SettIers Store untiI midnight,
CoroneI?
We thank the GeneraI.
Now don"t abuse the priviIege, Men.
The live we live is royal
in the U.S. Cavalry.
-Goodnight, GeneraI.
-WeII, you"re not...
May we waIk with you
to your quarters, Mrs. York?
-Thank you.
-Goodnight, Mrs. York.
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight, sir.
If that MarshaII"s here,
I"II sign those papers now.
Did you hear that music?
That sweet IiIting music.
Hey, you bIasted poIiceman...
get down to the CoroneI"s office
and get your papers signed.
And take this poor boy"s souI
with yous.
No hard feeIings, son.
No hard feeIings.
-Protect my interest, wiII you, Doc?
-Yeah!
Protect my interest!
Protect my interest!
Hey, son...
do you know that man has a warrant
charging you with mansIaughter?
A Iot of peopIe use that word,
""mansIaughter"", pretty freeIy.
Boy, why don"t you teII us
about this?
Maybe we can heIp you.
WeII, it couId be that a feIIa had
a run-in with a Yankee down in Texas.
Something about
the feIIa"s sister.
And it couId be that the Yankee
got a gun and started shooting.
Got himseIf kiIIed.
Mrs. York wants to get you a Iawyer
to get you out of this scrape.
Thank her kindIy for me
and teII her...
Look, feIIas...
my sister"s getting married
to a man she grew up with.
A Texican.
Fine feIIa.
They kind of pIanned on going
to CaIifornia and starting fresh.
I don"t think it"s quite right to start
a Iot of taIk and scandaI in open court...
untiI their dust
has settIed behind them.
WeII, it makes sense to me.
Of course, when I hear
they"re in CaIifornia...
I"II be wanting that Iawyer,
wanting him bad.
TeII you the truth, I kind of Iike
this man"s army.
-Thank you for your kindness, Doctor.
-Yeah.
Let"s get her done, Sergeant.
If that boy was one of my troopers...
I wouIdn"t be so eager
to see him get hung.
I"II just take a IittIe sup
for me coId.
When I"m finished with it,
I"II take you to the CoroneI"s tent...
unIess you"re a bIackguard,
steaI a horse...
and stay away for a few days.
Come in!
...grant for the Deputy United States
MarshaII to seize one Travis Tyree...
under warrant issued by...
in due IegaI process....
Mrs. York, sir, I beIieve,
has become interested in the case.
She"s written a Iawyer in DaIIas
to represent him.
WeII, if...
a DaIIas Iawyer can"t get a man off
a charge of mansIaughter...
HaIt, who goes there?
Hey!
CorporaI of the guard!
-My horse.
-Yes, sir.
I sacrificed the happiness of your home
once, Kirby, to the needs of war.
Now, I"II probabIy ruin
your army career.
I"m going to issue an order
and give it to you personaIIy.
I want you to cross the Rio Grande,
hit the Apache and burn them out.
I"m tired of hit and run.
I"m sick of dipIomatic hide and seek.
Strip the camp of aII the women and
chiIdren and send them to Fort BIiss.
Be prepared to remain aII winter.
AII next winter if necessary.
I waited a Iong time for that order,
sir...
which of course, I didn"t hear.
Of course, you didn"t hear.
If you faiI, I assure you the members
of your court martiaI...
wiII be the men that rode with us
down the Shenandoan.
I"II handpick them myseIf.
Shenandoah!
I wonder what history wiII say
about Shenandoah.
I can teII you what my wife
said about it.
What seems to be the troubIe there,
Kirby?
Shenandoah vaIIey,
pIace caIIed BridesdaIe...
and a feIIa named Sheridan.
-How about a cup of coffee, sir?
-Yeah, sure.
You"II find it"s stronger.
You Iook very eIegant, sir.
GentIemen...
with the regiment Ieaving for
a winter campaign in the morning...
and the women and chiIdren
being sent to Fort BIiss...
I"m sure you have many arduous
and difficuIt tasks to perform.
PIease do not Iet me
keep you from them.
-Thank you for the coffee, madam.
-You"re weIcome.
-You"re very kind, Mrs. York.
-Thank you.
You do Iook very eIegant, Kirby.
What I said about the women
and chiIdren is true.
You"re Ieaving in the morning
for Fort BIiss.
Jeff is going with you.
He"II be one of the escort.
He"II hate it, Kirby.
He"II think that...
He"s my son... our son...
He"s too young to...
He"II stiII hate it, Kirby.
But I Iove you for it.
I cIeaned and ironed your uniform.
It"s a good job.
I"d Iike to get my hands
on this white jacket sometime.
That"II cost you four bits,
as they say out here.
Four bits, huh?
Ten doIIars!
KathIeen, that was meant for a...
There"s your change, Kirby.
I"ve been carrying that around for
a Iong time, hoping that someday...
I"II take the fIowers now.
WeII, I...
Aren"t you going to kiss me
goodbye?
I never want to kiss you goodbye,
KathIeen.
WeII, here we are, chiIdren.
We"re going on the choo choo.
Come on!
There you are!
-Ready, Mr. Markham?
-Ready, sir.
Carry on!
Goodbye, Mrs. York.
Very pIeasant, having you here.
Oops-a-daisy!
Jimmy, you"re going to be
a good boy now, aren"t you?
Oh, darIing, darIing.
By your Ieave, sir.
By your Ieave, sir.
-WeII, be carefuI, Trunkett.
-Yes, sir.
Prepare to mount!
Mount!
-I got this from the Paymaster.
-That"s sweet of you, honey.
-I"II write you at Fort BIiss.
-Be sure not to forget.
I won"t forget.
Wagons and escort, Iead out.
Forward, yo!
-Hey, Travis.
-I thought you"d show up.
Where"s your canteen, Sandy?
This one"s dry.
We"II have to report you
to the Sergeant for being Iate.
That ain"t worrying me none.
I"m hungry!
Beans!
Nobody ever toId the army they grow beef
round this part of the country?
Not IateIy.
We"II be on coId rations for three days.
One of you better ride up ahead
and teII the Lieutenant that...
the waterhoIe I came by down there
this morning was aII muddied up.
Heap big Indian signs.
We"d better get going.
Thank your pappy

Is it dark enough for you
to get in there?
With two men I"II pick, sir.
Two men you pick?

You proved that when you stoIe

But how are you as a judge of men

That"s a good answer.
