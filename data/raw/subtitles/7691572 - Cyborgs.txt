At the beginning of the 21st century no
one believed in the possibility of war.
But in the spring of 2014  Russia's imperial ambitions led...
to an invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine.
One of the strategic objectives was the airport of Donetsk.
For 242 days the Ukrainian military was
to defend it, together with volunteers.
It seemed as if they had already lost their fight.
But nothing could stop them from standing firm.
For their courage and their seeming
invulnerability they were called "cyborgs".
According to unconfirmed reports...
the separatists are using a TOS-1
rocket launcher at midnight.
I think you know what that means.
Nothing will be here tomorrow.
There is no order to vacate the airport.
But,
if any of you want to go
I will understand.
Mischa?
I'm sorry, I really wanted to stay for a sauna today.
Stephan?
I don't feel like going anywhere today.
Igor?
I'm afraid of the dark.
Old man?
I have to look after all of your asses.
Damn, you really have balls.
You are not men, but...
Cyborgs.
LAST RESISTANCE - IN RUSSIAN CROSSFIRE
10 days earlier
Good luck, Serpen!
Thank you.
Do you have a minute?
Not now.
No time
Excuse me.
Please turn that off!
Could you give us a comment?
Don't worry, just a few questions.
I have nothing to say!
It wont take long.
Lieutenant, you're with me.
Sorry.
Yes, I've changed the password.
Because you keep snooping on my messages.
What? Larysa?
I don't know any Larysa.
- What vehicle are the paramedics in?
No, you just...
Are you crazy?
Where do you think I am? What?
Excuse me, commander. Where are we going?
I'm not your commander, and what are you still doing here?
Listen, for 5 months we've no replacements, we need
proper soldiers, not old men.
We will not give up the airport.
Ukraine is behind us.
How could you simply watch as the enemy attacks our country?
We continue to fight and will defeat them.
Mars!
As you can see, our soldiers prepare
for the march to the airport of
Donetsk, the center of the fighting.
The airport is only about 3 kilometres
from Pisky, where we are now.
Our soldiers call the road to the strategically important airport
the "road of life". They go there
to protect their families, their parents and their children.
They go there to protect Ukraine.
Aleksandr Zahorodny and Vlad Zhyrenko, TSM.
Well guys, let those damn Russians come
and we'll kick them hard in their fat asses!
Do you really mean that?
Of course, with tough battle machines like us!
Damn it! Move it, fast!
- They're gonna pop us out here!
Shit, we're burning alive
if we stay in here! Move!
Get down! Lie down!
Take cover!
My Kalashnikov.
- Stay here, I'll get it.
The Kalashnikov!
- Forget it!
Let's get out of here!
Faster!
Stand up! Get to the driver's seat!
Is everything okay?
- All good.
Come on, come on, hurry!
Did you order a taxi?
What are you sitting around here for?
Move, move!
Wait for me!
Wait for me!
Going to the airport?
- By chance, yes. Get in!
I thought I was gonna miss my flight!
How you all feeling?
- Like it's a fucking concert.
The fun is just beginning.
What do you mean?
When I say "concert"?
- Yeah.
Like a symphony concert?
Were you at the airport?
No, why?
You talk as if you had
liberated Ilovaysk.
Where do you get that from?
I just come from there.
- Me too.
I'll be glad to see my buddies again.
Damn, our weapons are still in the tank.
Shit, you're right.
Those damn bastards came to
our country, but they'll see.
They will drown in their own blood.
Okay, calm down.
Hey, you wouldn't believe it - we're here!
Welcome!
Long live the Ukraine, guys!
Long live the heroes.
Serpen.
Good to see you. How was the ride?
We had problems.
- Yeah?
Several injured. They were taken to Pisky.
Okay. Is this everyone?
- All those who made it.
Okay, got it. Come in everyone.
Come in guys!
Men, this is Serpen, I told you about him.
Come on, make yourselves at home.
Come on.
Igor?
- Yes?
Show the new guests our hotel.
- Okay. I've just finished the list.
So, guys, listen up! Equipment:
Here is the list of our equipment. A pair of boots in size 40
This is the shelter - what was that?
- We'll check that and get back to you.
Roger that.
So guys, you want to see our 4-star, all-inclusive hotel?
I'm Igor.
- Stephan.
Thank you.
And you?
I'm Mischa.
- Mars.
Oh, "god of war".
It's short for Marchenko Slava. Nothing more.
Oh stop it. No excuses.
Admit that you like it.
And who are you?
- Kolya.
Your fighting name.
Only Kolya. He was drafted.
So I'm worse?
- No, but also not a soldier.
This is not your group?
- No, my people had to go back.
Excuse me, I'm from the 79th
and looking for my men.
Igor will take you to them.
- Roger that.
Feels like home.
This is our so-called ... studio.
As you can see, all in one room:
kitchen, the shithouse, a bed...
Over there is our restaurant. "The three separatists".
Sounds unappetizing.
- It is, too.
Where are the enemy?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Good.
Come on guys, follow me!
- Didn't you hear?
From here on, keep your head down.
Do you think this ends well?
- We'll see.
With any luck, we'll get out of here unscathed.
It'll work out.
Base here; please respond.
- Igor here, I hear you.
Something is moving in the new terminal.
Where are you?
At the entrance. See you at the end.
Well, who fancies a bit of fun?
- Always.
Stop. Does everyone have a weapon?
- I've got grenades.
Okay. You two stay here.
God of War, follow me.
I'll cover you.
Where are you going?
Damn, I said stay there!
Why should I listen to you?
- Right.
They look like ours.
But I'm not sure.
Taras? You ready?
Igor?
Yeah, I'll give you cover.
- Okay guys, go!
What happened?
I don't know. Suddenly, they were on us.
Nobody saw anything.
Then they probably fell from the sky.
- Just make your jokes.
You read my mind. How many are there?
- About 40.
No, there's less.
- Where were you, exactly?
2nd floor, at the Duty Free.
- Hey, I've never been in a Duty Free.
My daughter says that the whiskey is cheap.
Definitely.
- You don't understand the seriousness of the situation.
I do, we understand everything.
You don't happen to have a grenade for me?
Get to work.
Okay, Igor, are we going in?
- You're real hardcore tourists.
Move out!
The boys will cover us.
Do you play Counter Strike?
It's like the video game, don't worry.
You can do this level, so come on. Clear?
Come on. Don't worry.
Good. To work, go!
Take cover!
Get back!
Hey, you fucking separatists!
Have we kicked your ass enough?
- Come here, you wankers
and we'll show you!
Come on, asshole!
They are not that stupid.
Do you have any ammo left?
Only three boxes.
- But there's six of us.
Five. Stephan stay here.
- Okay.
All right.
Hey, guys, we'll take the lookout route.
I have to show you something.
Good luck.
- And you.
It's just me.
What's happening?
I'll come with you.
Okay?
All right.
Scared us a bit.
- Did you shit yourself?
And how!
Well, did you miss me?
Go on, go on.
There we are.
What's this? A reward for good behaviour?
Of course, from the God of the airport.
Mind if I take a picture?
- Go for it.
But there are only dead ends here.
Probably mined, too.
Yeah. The separatists wanted to
exchange it for prisoners.
We said "well, come over and take it".
But they have not come.
Back to the Tower, folks.
You'll have a panoramic view
over the whole picturesque area.
There are many dead bodies and injured.
We can't get to them, they would catch us.
The snipers are extremely vigilant.
Over there to the left.
- Are you going through that?
They would not see you.
- And how do we get to the grove?
You're not going anywhere.
How can I fight without a weapon?
- You should have thought of that earlier.
Now you have to wait for an opportunity.
- Fortunately, you're not my commander.
Your commander says the same thing.
- Right...
I've heard that we have weak leader.
So guys, the mission is over.
We have to go back to the camp.
This terminal...
I've been here before, in 2011 or 2012.
When was the European Championship?
2012.
- So I was here in 2011.
That was in the old terminal. I invited a girl from Moscow.
From Moscow? You're a fine patriot.
No, it was fine. She was late.
Didn't you get any? The young guy
probably still has to practice.
Idiots! Her flight was delayed.
We bought a bottle of water at the bar...
Took two glasses and filled them
under the table with whiskey.
Like the rich people.
- Yep.
Whiskey has the same colour as brandy?
Kolya, which village do you come from?
- From Myrhorod, that's a city.
And there's no whiskey?
Our water is 100 proof and flows from every tap.
Holy shit! For a month now I've waited for a lid!
Sergei to Phoenix, was that you?
Of course, who else?
- Roger that.
What is that?
Where did you get that?
Spoils of war.
- Seriously?
Hey guys, what's there to whisper about?
Come over to the table.
Now?
- Well, come on.
That stuff is banned here.
It was also banned when you smuggled it into the bar.
Let's drink to the first day.
- Wait until the commander has gone.
Where can I put it?
Permission to speak, Commander.
Permission granted.
Volunteer Anton Jasinjsky, called Misha, reporting for duty.
I'm awaiting orders.
Were you in the Army?
No. I had 3 weeks of training in Desna.
I understand. Eat something with the others.
After that you will know everything.
Thank you, Commander.
What do you think of him? He's very eager, yeah?
When it comes to women, maybe.
- I can send him away.
No, not necessary.
Attention.
Bon appétit.
- Thank you.
Well, newbies, I want to thank you for your first day on duty.
Let us now turn to your tasks.
Your site is the new terminal.
- Got it.
And most importantly, Serpen will be your commander.
From now on, he is your lord and master.
Any questions?
- No, all clear.
Today we stand guard...
according to the following schedule. Listen up.
From 12-2...
Stephan and Kolya.
From 2 to 4...
Mars...
and Misha.
I'll cover from 4 to 6.
At 6 o'clock we go to the new terminal.
Roger that.
All clear.
Sergei? Can I talk to you?
Ice would be good.
What for?
Whiskey needs ice.
Is there ice in the refrigerator?
- Sure.
Take a look in the freezer.
- Clear it away, boys.
What the fuck, Igor?
Are you crazy?
How many disasters do we need?
Airports ... Chernobyl!
And you only think to get drunk!
Mars?
Listen, Mars.
Chill out.
Those were the first casualties.
We thought we might be able to exchange them for our own.
But no one gives a shit about them.
So they stay here, well chilled.
What do you feel when you...
kill people?
How is that?
I do not see them as human beings.
Not even when they are in front of you?
I'm happy.
Glad they did not kill me.
When you did it for the first time...
what did you say?
What are the questions?
Why do you ask this?
You'd understand, if you killed someone!
"What do you think? How do you feel?" Huh?
I will kill!
My classmate and good friend Vadik was buried a month ago.
We wanted ... we wanted to go to
Thailand next summer for a vacation.
These pigs came to our country and...
Easy, easy.
- I'll kill the pigs.
Mars - you will, you will.
- Everybody had better believe it!
I'll do it all.
- Mars, we can do it.
A really very appropriate ringtone.
Are you good?
Yeah?
Now we can relax, huh?
It's 4.
4am.
Fine. It's fine.
Where are you going?
To the toilet.
What's this?
Take over, I'll be right back.
Son of a bitch!
Cease fire, he's one of us! Stop! The idiot is one of us!
Oh man, shit...
One of you, on the first day...
...has broken my rules.
Maybe he's here for another reason, like I am.
Therefore I'd like to know what your reasons are.
Please be honest.
Because I hate.
Who?
The ones that kill our friends.
That exceed our limits.
All the fucking pigs that came here.
But they are people.
The Russians, people from
Kadyrov, I don't know them.
You know that Ukrainians are here too?
These are not Ukrainians.
Ukrainians love the Ukraine.
Do you love her?
- Yes. Naturally.
Everything about it?
Like what?
What do you mean what?
- Well, it's just a question.
Maybe it's possible to not love Ukraine.
Do you love your wife because of something special?
- On the contrary...
because of nothing in particular.
There's nothing to love.
She is old and cantankerous.
Except maybe her borscht.
- But you see? Borscht is something in particular.
And Ukraine?
For what?
For its beautiful nature.
- Right. What is beautiful?
The Cherry Orchard front of your house, yeah?
It's true.
- Do you have one?
My parents had one.
Do you love our streets?
Very funny.
- Yeah, exactly, there's nothing to love about those.
There are no roads. Also no more gardens.
Want beautiful nature? Then go to Chernobyl.
So what we are fighting for?
When I see how shitty everything is...
then that hurts a lot.
Why not leave us alone?
First, the government, then a neighbouring country.
If I picture the Russian border at Poltava...
does that leave me literally heart-stopped?
I can not hear these lies anymore,
because of a brother nation
dictating what the other has to do.
Children go to war.
Children.
Even my son.
Because I had to. I had to fight.
And I have a garden.
Right here.
Got it?
Yes, understood.
And you?
Me?
I'm a soldier.
I have an oath.
That is reason enough.
Not for me.
To follow orders is not enough
of a reason to be in this war.
In this war...
In this war, you have to think, love, and feel the injustice.
The old man feels injustice, that's why he's here.
That is the strongest motive.
I also feel.
Believe me.
We are fighting not only against the Russians and Kadyrov people.
We are also fighting against Ukrainians.
And that's terrible.
We need to be here.
We need to think.
How could it all just happen?
Whose fault is it? We must learn to study history...
analyse our mistakes.
That we are here...
means that we are willing to pay for the past...
and protect the present.
To take responsibility for the future.
Serpen...
I want to join your team.
And why's that?
Because I love Ukraine.
Propaganda works!
Asshole.
I'll go look.
Sure, just go.
Bitches!
Who's the crazy man in the separatist car?
Yes, just a little closer.
Igor, try this.
Nice.
Igor! Stop!
Serpen to Karat.
Serpen to Karat.
Karat here; go ahead.
Let the car through, it's one of us.
It's us?
- Yes, us!
What a son of a bitch.
Where did he get the damn car from?
That idiot!
You're crazy.
- Well, Kolya.
This is for you, from our Russian brothers.
- What a gift, kid!
What a show!
- Yeah it was awesome, right?
Well done.
Glad you're back.
The transportation of casualties to Pisky
commences tonight at 8 o'clock.
They'll go with you.
- Please let me explain.
At 8 o'clock you leave the
airport, for ignoring orders.
You even brought a separatist.
Damn it!
Mars!
What's wrong with you? Why did you do that?
He would have given us important information.
- For Vadik, that was for my friend Vadik.
Come on, boy, come on. Get up, go.
- I can't.
Come on. Let's go, let's go. Hurry up, get in, quickly.
God damn shit!
Serpen, can I talk to you?
Only briefly.
- I should stay here.
I don't think so.
- Serpen, I have to stay here!
I told them not to walk around!
They disobeyed my order!
Because you were not commander.
- But I was commander...
I commanded them to gather at 6am!
Yes, it's my fault!
I thought I could do it in time
but got lost, then they appeared.
I even have the papers of two Russians. Let me stay.
Agreed. The papers stay, you go.
To hell with you! I'm going but you stay?
You screwed up the last 23 years!
Stop! - What?
When did I screw up?
Listen: I'm not a history professor, I do not
know exactly the facts and processes.
But I know one thing: despite all the facts,
23 years ago a land was handed over to you.
Ukraine, full of resources and an economy.
And you just get it like that, without war or sacrifice.
You just had to develop and improve!
It's like family!
Either you take care of them, or you sell the house and yard!
Leaving your children nothing but uncertainty and fear.
That's what you did to our country. You made shit.
You screwed it up and the country was almost lost!
And you have no fucking chance to defend it,
because you have already lost!
All who were born in the Soviet Union
are now losers and traitors!
And that is why I am here today...
rather than at a shitty international competition
where I wouldn't get to hold a fucking gun!
Damn, you have me thrown back
several generations!
Because of you I have to steal weapons!
And you can't stop me now!
Mischa.
- What?
Educate yourself. And learn from it.
Eat me.
Commander.
Uh, Mars is not good.
Okay.
How are you?
Everything there?
He has a heart condition.
This goes under the tongue.
OK then.
You'll be better soon.
Has this happened before?
We have to get him out of here.
We'll do the following:
You go home...
get examined...
and come back later if you want.
I promise you, no one will leave you out of this.
Understand?
Well, it'll be fine.
Can you walk? Come on, let's go.
Come, come.
Take care of yourself, okay.
Too bad.
Thanks for the weapon. I'll take care of it.
Can we go?
Sure, of course.
What was that competition?
A music competition in Vienna.
And were you scared?
You bet.
One more extra tour and that's it for you.
Good luck, kid!
- Go on!
Come on, we're leaving!
What is he doing there?
- Scaring off Separatists.
Who was the concert for?
In honor of the famous writer Nicolai Gogol.
You like Gogol?
Very much.
Now listen up, stop wasting time
and get into position.
That's an order.
So, people...
My apologies...
but in school no one could force me to read Gogol or Shevchenko.
I read Stephen King, and still do.
And as far as national myths are concerned,
we're just gonna make our own.
And for the next few centuries...
Hey, what's the panic?
Guess they'll be coming soon.
They have nothing to eat down
there, and not much water.
Hey boys!
Dinner! It'll be better soon.
You heard him.
My favorite, beans.
Attack!
Grenade!
All clear.
Bloody hell.
The bitch is gone.
Respect, Kolya. Man, did you see that?
He grabs a gun and does it almost
all single-handedly!
Kolya, I thought you were a beekeeper,
but in reality you are a fighting machine.
I couldn't shoot before because I had no weapon.
Serpen, did you even notice the separatists?
Hey, calm down, all right.
- Are you kidding me?
I couldn't shoot. My arms disobeyed me.
It can happen.
Good job, guys.
- Thanks, Commander.
Now we have to hold the position?
- That's our task.
We must keep the first floor...
and find the last separatists.
- I just wish he would be the last.
The last in the terminal.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
No.
If you look at it like that, it doesn't look like war.
Do what.
I mean, if you do this.
Narrow your field of vision and ignore the war.
Well, you're right.
But you can't stand like that for long.
I know you, you live in my area. You played the trumpet.
There was smoke, screams and shots...
and suddenly you were there with your music.
It was really pure madness.
It seems to me as if you're talking
about someone entirely different.
What do your parents think
of you being here?
I was drafted.
My father ... has connections.
He really tried everything, phoned everywhere.
Mother was hysterical. She said I should go abroad.
I said, well, okay.
We drove to the airport, said goodbye.
I sat in the Duty Free Zone.
Then I saw the news.
It was covering the Donetsk airport.
I wondered how it compared to Borispolj airport.
And then you simply changed your mind?
I did not go overseas.
I took all the necessary papers to the recruiting office.
And your parents still don't know that you're here at the front?
"Mother, it stormed today, so we could not swim."
That's how it looks to her.
Damn, she'll find out soon.
But the later the better.
You know, I admit I ignored the
civil protests for a long time.
But that changed quickly when they began to threaten...
to clear the public square with force.
I went there because I was sure that the place would be empty.
But what I saw there was completely illogical.
No one was allowed to be there, yet many had gathered.
There were thousands of people who were active.
Not even ants work so hard.
I saw someone in a wheelchair had cleared snow from the road.
I went to help him.
I don't know what happened, but suddenly I said to myself in tears:
"That's for you, Lyosha."
"You wanted it."
Then I started working in mental health care.
But with my medical training they sent me straight here.
Listen, we're all sitting in the same boat.
I like what you did. Many of us would not have done that.
Stop!
Long live the Ukraine.
Long live the heroes.
What are you doing here?
I'm bringing ammunition for my team.
Where are your people?
- I don't know.
Which brigade?
- The 71st.
Can I go?
- Go ahead.
Wait!
Who the hell are you? There is no 71st Brigade!
I'm on your side! Are you crazy,
shooting at your own people.
Put the gun down.
Take three steps back.
You'll come with me and we'll find out who you are.
- Good, good. Yes, yes.
Igor, come here and have a look.
What is it?
Holy shit!
What should I do?
Call your wife and ask her.
What do I tell her?
"Larysa, I've got a pregnant cat, can you help me?"
You're an ass, I prefer to fight.
And now? What now, kitten?
We did it, kitten!
And it was not so bad. Congratulations.
So, then do what mother cats have to do. Feed them.
And I have to go now. I have something else to do.
Well then, until next time little one.
Damn it!
Hardly any ammunition!
Get down!
Where is everyone?
Where's Mischa? Where's Stephen?
Damn it!
Stephan is on the spot!
Get down!
Tanyucha threw up!
Your sister?
- No, the cat!
I'll cover you!
Retreat!
We need to get out of here! Go, go, faster!
Look out! Grenade!
Why is it so quiet?
- It's over.
Over?
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
Why not shoot them?
- Because we won.
Are you sure?
It was just hell.
We've beaten them back.
Where are they all?
The seriously wounded were taken away.
We should have gone too,
but there was no more room.
Ah, you're awake.
I slept through it all.
I wouldn't call it sleep. Are you sick?
Turn around. You have a concussion.
You must stay in your bed. Today, in any case.
Tomorrow we will continue.
Take a break.
Name?
Yegorov Pjotr ​​Ivanovich.
And just what were your orders here, Pyotr Ivanovich?
Not responding.
You deaf, or what?
I don't understand him.
Where are you from?
From Vladimirskaya Oblast.
He can speak.
What the hell are you doing here. Pyotr Ivanovich?
Out with it.
We were brought here. No idea why.
Bitch!
What?
Nationalist bitch!
Hey, Igor.
The medics are going to look at him.
- Roger that.
And where are you from, loudmouth?
- I come from here, all right?
We'll talk about this later.
We need an open channel and one hour of ceasefire.
We meet on neutral ground. Send unarmed men.
You stay on your position until we
get back to the base. You got that?
Good.
Hey, Misha. You drive them back. I'll take them to the ambulance.
Can you drive?
- Yes.
Good. Let's go.
Bring the men. What are you staring at?
I'm remembering your face.
Svat!
Only one of you.
- I'm scared if I'm alone.
The weapon stays here.
Here are the prisoners.
Their passports, and supplies.
Look, everything is there.
One sound out of you and I'll make you cold!
Igor, are you crazy?
- I don't care. Just make a peep!
Not for me. Or the others.
But we all want to go home.
And the others who were slaughtered?
Of these animals? What about them?
Hey are you crazy? I want to go home to my children.
To your children? And you? Want to see your damn kids too?
Hey, is everything okay?
Yes, we checked everything.
Ukrainian pig.
Is it true that they buried Russian soldiers
in secret after they were in Donbas?
What did you say?
Guys.
Keep calm. We have guns on you.
Just like us.
- We all do.
Can we not just smile?
How long are you going to count, damn it?
You stay here, and I'll check what's going on.
Take it easy.
We go together.
Misha, if you have to, this one first.
Come on.
All right.
Bring our boys out!
Send them!
What was going on?
- We were counting.
Hell, let's get out of here!
- I'm trying, damn it!
Our boys are safe. Well done.
Come on out, but be careful.
Bloody hell, have you ever been to driving school?
I can only drive an automatic!
- Thanks for the hell ride!
Hello.
How did the exchange go?
Normal.
"Smoothly", as the Russian saying goes.
How many boxes were there?
- There were 8.
Now there's seven.
How many?
7, damn it!
I know who.
Who, what?
That bloody separatist.
Show me where he was.
- Sure, this way.
Holy shit.
Why is he still here? What's the point?
I thought you might want to ask a few questions.
Looks like you started already.
Yeah, but only a few words.
Get the paramedics.
I will.
They have disfigured me.
My face.
I'm a monster. Shit, huh?
Women can't look at my face. Do you understand me?
But the tortures are the best.
I've been tortured many times.
First they make eye contact, then they pass judgment!
Then they hold a gun to your head until you shit your pants!
They've done it seven times!
And the one I left alive is called The Svat.
Do you know what they did to me? Want to see it?
Do you?
I'm just kidding.
Was just a joke.
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you.
This looks pretty, right? Too bad that I can't see it.
I can only feel it. You tell me.
How does it look? Like a landscape painting?
Or more like a map?
Calm down, brother.
I'm not arguing with you.
Do you hear?
What day is it?
Friday.
So tomorrow is the weekend. What do we do tomorrow, guys?
Maybe we go to the amusement park and ride the carousel.
When did you last sleep?
- What?
I asked, when did you last sleep.
I sleep enough. But...
Just shoot me and go to hell.
Are you ready to die?
For the Donetsk People's Republic?
Or what are you fighting for?
Freedom and independence.
I'm fighting for freedom and independence.
And you split the country, traitor.
The country has been split since the 1990s.
You mean the USSR?
I'll tell you something: that country doesn't exist anymore.
But only because of people like you.
Before I hand you to security, I'll give
you a history lesson.
I was always good at history.
My grandfather was a soldier, and my father was a miner.
Honest and righteous people who
always believed in their country.
And we want that back. A country
that protects people, not robs them.
How old was your father when he died?
50 years.
Mine was 53.
Also a miner.
He worked in a mine all his life.
In western Ukraine, the miners also die young.
How many buddies got to 60?
What is the statistic?
And you say your country has taken care of you?
What changed by your government?
In 23 years ... what has your government done?
Hence, the Maidan Massacre.
[Civilians killed in Kiev's Independence Square]
Because nothing changed.
For this reason:
To prolong the life of our children and parents.
I appreciate your opinion.
We should have spoken to each
other over the past 23 years.
We have the same goal.
I wonder why all these wars?
Chechnya, Abkhazia, Georgia?
These wars ... started by your motherland.
I'm too tired.
I don't give a shit.
Do you have one for me?
I thank you.
Serpen...
Let me go home.
Are you not the enemy?
I can't just let you go.
But you can ask my partner.
But why waste your time?
He has no objection to releasing you.
Isn't that right, Mischa?
It's your decision.
Let him go quietly.
You're right.
You can go.
Don't shoot. Let the man go. Do you understand?
Roger.
That should not be.
That was his people.
Did you know that would happen?
I was 99% sure.
And you let him go?
That was you.
And me.
He had a 1% chance.
A whole lot.
According to unconfirmed reports ...
the separatists are using a TOS-1
rocket launcher at midnight.
I think you know what that means.
There is no order to vacate the airport.
But...
if any of you want to go
I will understand.
- I'm sorry...
I really wanted to stay for a sauna today.
I don't feel like going anywhere today.
I'm afraid in the dark.
I have to look after all of your asses.
This is really incredible.
You are not men. You are ... cyborgs.
Hey Tanyucha, you're an animal.
You have an instinct.
Why don't you take your little ones and go?
My father told me that they also used a
TOS-1 rocket launcher in Afghanistan.
The mountain villages were inaccessible, so they kept it.
Every living thing within a 3km radius burned.
That shit was prohibited under international law.
It's produced by a Russian company.
Nice gift, one day prior to transfer.
Are you calling someone?
It's 6pm.
So?
I prefer to leave one last LIKE.
One last LIKE does not sound good in this situation.
To each his own.
One prays before death. The other writes a letter.
I choose the LIKE version.
Damn, I do not believe it.
- What?
It's just tanks.
There are really only tanks?
- It can't be!
People!
Only tanks! Look!
Dad hasn't allowed the rocket launcher out.
Doesn't matter! Tanks? So then tanks!
We have already written wills.
When I die, bury me high up on the old hill...
in my beloved Ukraine, in the wide steppe country...
where you see nothing but golden fields, Dnipro's rocky coast.
You should suffocate, Separatist whore!
What is this nonsense?
- Sounds good.
From Ukraine to the blue sea, we drive the enemy's blood.
I leave everything behind, fly up to the God of the land.
The blood of the adversary. I leave the wheat country forever.
I speak my prayer. Because until then I knew no God.
Do not jump before you are pushed.
Bury me there and rise, smash your chains.
Seal your freedom with the blood from the veins of our enemies.
Calm down!
We'll talk to the commander, and get in position.
Let's go boys.
Separatist whore!
Same sector.Section 8. 50 metres closer, buddy.
A little closer!
Now it really starts.
They're doing really well!
I'm out of ammo!
- Serpen, are you on the radio?
Serpen here, speak!
- Headquarters is worried!
The truce was not respected again.
What a shame! What do we do with the enemy?
Punish them accordingly.
- At your command!
Over and out.
Should we punish them?
- Why, surely!
I'll kick your ass!
Oh yes, I'll get you soon and spank that ass!
What's he doing there?
Hit!
Come on! Come on! We've got to stop that!
This thing doesn't drive!
Stephan! Hold your position!
Come on! Come on!
- Come on!
Come on! Move!
Stephan!
We need a medic!
- Come on!
Really?!
Take that, you bastards!
That goes online. I'm a hero.
I'll put music under it later.
Press.
- All right.
Stay back.
We'll take over for him!
- Roger that. Let's go!
Are you still alive? Get out, my friend!
At least you could take a selfie.
Already posted.
23,000 LIKES in half an hour. My wife has unblocked me again.
Then she called again, from her friend's phone.
Her's was broken. She just cried.
You're a big boy. Your wife is worried.
After we fight, we usually have really good phone sex.
Should we go outside?
- My arm hurts anyway.
We have to get him out of here. That slug's in deep...
otherwise we will not find it.
- Roger that.
Mischa.
You bring Stephan to Pisky.
Why me?
That is an order.
Guys, what are you doing? Don't I get a say?
Why me?
Are you scared?
Don't worry, lucky guy, you can do it.
Serpen, what is this shit?
I'm not scared, still lucky.
This is not shit, but an order.
Stephan has to leave the airport immediately.
It's about life and death, you understand?
Serpen, he needs urgent surgery.
Just one moment...
Was I really useless?
- Why do you think that?
What about the others? Why me?
The old man can do that. He will soon be a grandfather.
Serpen, I'm not tired.
- I know.
You pretend that something is wrong with me!
Something IS wrong with you.
You do not follow my orders.
And this is no place for you. Got it?
Make way for real soldiers.
- Move.
Do you know Anton Yasynskyy?
The musician?
- Yes.
He's won international competitions.
And I let him fight here.
Sani!
I'll prepare Stephan for transport.
- Do that.
Do I really have to leave?
- You must.
Why ask the question? If you're feeling better, you come back.
We will be waiting for you.
I'll be back. Most certainly.
I'm fine now, I'll stay!
Is he okay?
No, he is not.
Hello. How nice to hear your voice.
I'm doing quite well.
And how are you?
A Russian poem?
So I know Pushkin.
This one...
By the sea stands a green oak tree;
A golden chain strung round it:
And on the chain a learned cat
Day and night circles round it;
Walking right, he sings a song,
Walking left, he tells a tale.
Hello Darling?
What a crappy connection. Bloody hell...
Hello? Do you hear me?
Hello, cyborgs, honor to Ukraine!
How?
His daughter.
I can't do it.
Hi, Sonja.
No, this is not your father.
Is Mama at home?
Please get her on the phone.
Oh no ... Can't someone else drive?
- Get in now, Stephan.
All the best.
Shit!
Hold on, Stephen, we'll make it.
Damn, man.
Open it.
Is he dead?
Yes, but he is still warm.
Definitely sepsis.
What?
Blood poisoning.
So Mischa caught him after all.
Damn it.
Quickly to the infirmary with him.
- Yes I know. Come quickly.
I heard there was a dead man.
Serpen, brother. Almighty...
Oh gracious God, we pray to you.
We ask you not to forget the fallen soldiers in your land.
Welcome them into your kingdom of heaven,
 as wounded martyrs who fought for us.
Be merciful, O Lord, and take them to you into your
 kingdom, because they gave their young lives
for the independence of Ukraine, for their brothers and their families.
There is no greater love...
than the love...
which brought them to give their own
life for the lives of their friends.
This is true love.
Rest in peace.
Amen.
Before you serve in my unit, I want to
know what motivated you to be here.
Why have you come?
Why are you not with your women and mothers?
Your work?
You can help in many areas.
Why do you think you have to be here of all places?
I can not just sit at home and do nothing.
I understand.
I am a Crimean. I have to be here.
I understand.
- I forgot my trumpet.
You bastard! Mischa!
Nice to see you Misha!
I knew you come back!
Guys, this guy is just amazing!
While you were gone, my granddaughter was born.
I am glad.
- Us as well.
And? How about a tour?
Follow me!
We also call this room our banquet hall.
Sometimes we celebrate balls here.
Then we dance.
Square dance.
Come on! Move!
