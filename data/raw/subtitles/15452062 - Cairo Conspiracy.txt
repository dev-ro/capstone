ATMO and MEMENTO PRODUCTION
present
In 972, the Fatimids founded Al-Azhar
to make it the center
of Islamic learning.
The Grand Imam
is the highest authority
in Sunni Islam.
Over the centuries,
the rulers of Egypt
tried to control Al-Azhar.
Until now, they have failed.

BOY FROM HEAVEN
Oh, God!
Wake up, come on!
Hello.
For you.
Open it.
You have been accepted
at Al-Azhar University...
Congratulations.
Come here!
God blessed you with a gift.
You came here everyday to read.
Al-Azhar is the world's
greatest Islamic institution.
And they chose you.
Come here!
Yes, Father?
Give me your hand.
You smell of tobacco.
All of you, palms!
What are you doing?
Shut up, you'll wake Dad.
What's that?
- I got a scholarship.
- No way!
- In Cairo?
- Yes.
What will you tell Dad?
I don't know.
You know what he's like.
He'll find out.
What do you want?
Go back to sleep!
God gave you a brain
that thinks more than necessary.
You're like your mother.
She was always curious.
God bless her soul.
She sent you to school
so you wouldn't be
a fisherman like me!
I made your brother
read me the letter.
If God wants you to go to Cairo,
no one can stand in His way.
Not even your father.
Safe journey.
Thank you.
I'll miss you.
Take care of yourself, Adam.
Will you take care of Dad?
Promise?
Look at me.
Promise?
You know how much I love you.
Yes, Dad.
- Don't forget where you're from.
- Yes, Dad.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Dad.
Wow! Al-Azhar!
It's the elite.
May God bless you with knowledge.
- What's your name?
- Adam, sir.
What a fine name!
God willing, when you finish
your studies, you'll be Sheikh Adam!
Here.
Goodbye.
3rd floor, corridor on the right,
regional office.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
Excuse me.
Hello.
I think you're in my bed.
No, it's mine.
Yes?
Is this bed free?
- Do you snore?
- No.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Then, it's free.
Are you new here?
Yes, I just arrived.
Welcome.
Please, can you turn off the light?
This life is just a game,
amusement,
boasting
and competing for material wealth.
Like if rain
made the grass
pleased with itself for growing.
It will eventually dry,
turn yellow,
and become dust and debris.
The afterlife is eternal.
And there,
all that matters is
forgiveness from God.
What are you doing?
Me? Creating a new brand of cigarettes.
My own brand.
Listen, Adam.
It doesn't matter who you are.
It's who you want to be.
We're late.
Calm down, sardine.
God has rewarded you
with a steady hand.
You don't tremble.
In the name of God the merciful,
Al-Azhar
is the beacon of the Islamic world.
And the day...
you leave Al-Azhar
and return to your villages,
you too will be
the bearers of this knowledge.
Alright, Sheikh?
Out of the way!
Call the medics!
The Grand Imam's condition is critical.
What's he saying?
Let us pray for the Grand Imam.
We wish him
a speedy recovery very soon.
Hello. I have an appointment
with the General.
OK, sir. Park inside.
Open the gates.
Who'll handle the situation?
Colonel Ibrahim, sir.
Have a seat.
As you all know,
the Grand Imam died yesterday.
God bless his soul.
God bless his soul.
Now we need
our candidate
to become the new Grand Imam.
Of course, sir.
Who do we have inside?
We have eyes and ears,
but it's tricky.
Really hard.
The idiots changed the constitution.
The Grand Imam
is now appointed for life.
This is not about issuing
some minor religious recommendations.
The choice of the Grand Imam
is a matter of national security.
No one should sit for life,
except our President!
We don't want that!
We can't accept
having two pharaohs in the land!
Sheikh Durani is close
to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Terrorist supporter!
The Blind Sheikh...
is one of the most popular imams
in Egypt.
And he has no known affiliations.
The President...
wants Beblawi.
His views align with the President's.
Make sure he is elected.
Consider it done, sir.
Do you have a prayer mat?
Ahmed, bring the General a prayer mat!
Stay away
until the new Grand Imam is chosen.
Until you have been chosen.
Please.
Stay out of this.
Who does the Council want?
The majority want the Blind Sheikh.
We want someone else.
I've been exposed.
You must let me go.
You know
the sentence for traitors?
Death.
Find me a new "angel".
A freshman without connections.
Don't worry.
Close your eyes
so you can see the truth.
Necessity is blind
until it becomes conscious.
And freedom is a necessity
of consciousness.
Do you know who said that?
The Jewish philosopher, Karl Marx.
He also said that religion
is proof
of Man's mental impotence
in the face
of what he cannot understand.
Life
is not a game.
Hello there.
Hello.
Where are you from?
Manzala.
Fisherman?
I'm Sheikh Negm's assistant.
If you need any help...
Thank you.
Tell me,
what doctrine
does Sheikh Negm follow?
The truth.
Which truth?
Sheikh Negm's truth.
Do you want to pray?
Been downtown yet?
I'm going tonight.
Want to come?
Alright.
It's halal.
Drink!
I found my replacement.
A fisherman's son.
What?
Come.
Your soul is still pure.
What?
But every second in this place
will corrupt it.
Wait here.
This morning,
one of our students was found dead.
And Colonel Ibrahim is here
to investigate this tragedy.
May God help him
to find out the truth.
I'm sorry to intrude
at this sensitive time.
We can suspend our investigation
until you've chosen a new Grand Imam.
Can you tell me
when it will be announced?
It's a purely technical matter.
We have our own rules
and we follow them.
May God guide you.
Who was his teacher?
He was an assistant in my department.
What else can you tell me about him?
Nothing you don't already know.
Why is State Security
investigating this?
The deceased is a foreign national.
President Nasser
tried to turn Al-Azhar
into a state institution.
Sadat tried to corrupt it.
And Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak
tried to change the laws of God
to please the Americans
and the women around her.
So, tell us, Colonel...
What are your instructions?
All I want to know
is why the boy is dead.
Osama.
Where are you from?
Alexandria.
Ahmed from Giza.
Name?
Adam Taha.
- Where are you from, Adam?
- Manzala.
Fisherman?
Yes.
You can go.
You forgot your feet.
After sunset, leave through the gate
Zizo showed you.
Then, take a minibus downtown.
Get off at Mohandeseen...
by the Arab League.
There's an American caf√© there.
Meet me there.
Order something
and sit at a table near me.
Take out your phone
as if talking to someone.
Did you order something?
I'm not hungry, sir.
They'll throw you out
if you don't order.
I don't have any money.
Order a cinnamon latte
and a brownie with cream.
A cinnamon latte...
and a brownie with cream.
Keep it till our next meeting.
No relatives in Cairo?
No.
So, what happened?
Men were waiting for us
as we came back from the mosque.
Who?
Men with blades.
Officially,
your friend died from an accident.
But as you saw, he was murdered.
We'll find out who did it.
And they will pay for it.
We want you to help us.
Sir, all I know...
Look, Adam.
All I want you to do
is to attend dawn prayer.
To pray?
Pray...
and observe who else is praying.
Remember their faces,
learn their names.
- Adam?- Yes, it's me.
Someone asked me to do something.
I'm not sure
if it's acceptable or if it's a sin.
Right is right and sin is sin.
God will guide you.
Prayer is better than sleep.
God is great.
There is no other God.
Straight line, stand upright.
No spaces.
We will all die, my children.
Whoever complains
about life's accidents
and God's destiny
will weaken his faith.
Now,
you may go.
I ask you
to pray for your brother...
and ask God to have mercy on him
and forgive him his sins.
- Do you have the names?
- No.
Your father has gallstones.
That's why he's in pain.
If untreated, he'll die.
We have a hospital in Dakahlia.
I will arrange the surgery.
He won't know you helped him.
We don't forget
those who work for us.
But I must ask you...
Don't call your village Imam again.
And I want to know who prays
in the mosque at dawn.
Sharia is not Islamic law.
Rather it's divine right.
Fiqh is the human interpretation
of this right.
In Sharia, there are 5 principles:
nurturing religion,
life, material goods,
offspring, and reason.
Recite.
Brother...
I have a study group
for those wishing
to perfect their recitation.
You're welcome.
Aslam
Asfur
Harun
Nazim
God bless you!
Well done.
Over to you, brother.
He's singing, Sheikh!
Let it go.
He's new here.
He doesn't know
we don't sing here.
It's prohibited to sing the Quran.
STATE SECURITY
Come in.
Honorable Sheikh!
Come in, sir. Come in.
How can I help you, sir?
I am here to confess.
Confess?
I killed him.
Please, I can't believe that, sir...
Have a seat, please.
Why?
Because I'm blind?
No, but you're
a respected scholar, sir...
Do you have another suspect?
No, but we continue
to investigate the accident.
"We"?
Who's "we"?
I mean State Security.
And you work for who?
The President?
Correct.
My President is God Almighty.
Very well, Sheikh.
How could you be so reckless?
Recruiting a foreign informant?
What's more,
the Blind Sheikh's assistant!
What were you thinking?
I never planned for him to die, sir.
Skip the sarcasm, man.
I know.
Every morning, in the mirror, you say:
"Why am I not the boss?"
You're older than me.
You worked here much longer...
Know why you haven't been promoted?
No, sir.
But I have a feeling
you know and you're about to tell me.
I swear to you.
If this blows up in our face,
you're finished, not me.
- Understood?
- Yes.
Listen.
You leave me no choice.
Arrest him.
Hello.
Aslam Aslan, Nazim Bin Sa'eed...
Nazim Bin Sa'eed?
Sounds foreign.
He's from Algeria.
I hear
your father's surgery went well.
I'm forever grateful.
No need to thank me, Adam.
Your work is important to us.
Let me tell you a secret.
We think the Muslim Brothers
infiltrated Al-Azhar.
And they had your friend killed.
Know this book?
It's a guide to modern Jihad.
But it's banned, sir.
Let Nazim see you with it.
Don't be afraid.
How are you?
OK.
The infidels in power
treat real Muslims as terrorists.
We invite you to have tea with us.
Thank you.
You like
reading forbidden books?
Adam, we are a family here.
You can trust us.
Not the books
that God has condemned...
or idolatrous books.
But...
the books that scare tyrants...
and kings.
It's time for every Muslim
to make a choice.
Our children are killed in Palestine.
Our women are raped
by infidels in Syria and Iraq.
China has built concentration camps
to exterminate
Muslims.
And still,
our leaders look the other way
and take their money.
In Burma, they kill us.
And what does
the so-called "civilized" world say?
They give the Nobel Peace Prize
to the leader of the criminal gangs
that are killing us.
No need to look any further.
Al-Azhar!
The beacon of Islam in the world.
What does Al-Azhar say about all this?
Nothing.
Talking of which,
do you know
what happened to the Blind Sheikh?
I heard he's sick.
State Security arrested him.
They'll keep him till the Grand Imam
they want is chosen.
They think
they can intimidate the Council
to elect their puppet candidate.
But they will fail.
The corrupt leaders
of this country
are trying to stop the will of God.
And they use snakes
to infiltrate us.
Your friend Zizo.
Some say I killed him.
Really, brothers?
Why do you think they say that?
You know what I think?
State Security killed him.
Brother.
Are you willing
to do more than reading?
Yes.
Soliman thinks
you arrested the Blind Sheikh
to force the Council
to choose your candidate.
And?
He says...
that you will fail, sir.
I will fail?
He said that, sir.
You said that, Adam.
No, he said that. Not me.
He doesn't trust you.
He's using you as a messenger.
You must earn his trust.
How?
Do you share his views?
I'll take that as a yes.
Does it matter what I believe, sir?
Sure it does. To him.
How does Satan...
penetrate religious minds?
Welcome to the dark side.
Shut up.
"Establishing God's kingdom on earth,
destroying man's,
wresting authority from the usurpers,
and returning it to God,
the supremacy
of the divine law alone,
the abolition of human laws
and all which do not obey
the precepts..."
Raeed, Raeed, please!
"Milestones" by Sayyid Qutb.
What?
Why hang around Soliman
and his gang?
- It's just a study group.
- A group he's the leader of.
You know they hate me, right?
Idiot!
Not a word about the book.
I won't.
You're doing
the recitation contest on Friday?
Against your new friends.
Are you confident?
Sure. Always.
Don't come crying
when you lose on Friday.
Come on, let's go.
Why don't you like Soliman?
I just don't...
Is it what he did
to your friend Raeed?
He's not my friend.
No?
No.
Does he suspect you?
Don't worry.
I'll silence him.
No...
Why do you care?
Since he's not your friend.
Tariq Ibn-Ziyad burned his boats
when landing in Spain.
He said to his men: "The sea
is behind, the enemy in front."
Must I burn your father's boat
to motivate you?
No.
Earn Soliman's trust.
How's Dad?
Has anyone visited you?
No one?
Sorry, I can't talk more.
I miss you.
Stop!
Stop, Asfur.
You forgot "they persisted".
"They persisted and appeared proud."
And now, down to the two finalists.
The winner is
Raeed Abdelmaged!
Congratulations, son.
What do you want?
What do you want?
- Informant!
- What have I done?
Is this because I won?
What's this?
They aren't mine.
Dirty rat!
Adam...
what have you gotten into?
You did the right thing, brother.
God punishes the faithless.
God bless you.
Well done.
Adam...
who gave you "Milestones"?
You know, it's a banned book.
Yes.
- Who gave you your copy?
- My uncle.
He has a bookstand.
- Really?
- Yes.
He sells books, God bless him.
Call him.
Now?
Yes, now.
OK.
I have no credit.
Here...
Put it on speaker.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle, how are you?
Hello, Adam. How are you?
We miss you.
I'm good. Just fine.
I just wanted...
to thank you.
For the book you gave me.
What? I don't understand.
The book I took from your place.
The book...
Don't you remember?
I really don't understand, Adam.
Is there a problem?
No, Uncle.
S.O.S.
Who are you texting?
Give me your phone.
Watch him.
Get lost!
Who do you work for?
I don't understand.
Damn those stairs...
Look down, Adam.
How many meters to the ground?
12...
Maybe 13.
Your body will be unrecognizable.
Who do you take orders from, boy?
Sheikh Durani, sir.
Are you sure you want
to play games with me?
I carry out the orders
I get over the phone.
Today you submit your resignation.
And tell Sheikh Durani
that Adam will replace you.
Then, tell the University
you want to study something else.
Tourism maybe.
I hear it's picking up again.
The Sphinx is smiling again.
Yes, sir.
Coffee.
Can you make coffee?
My assistant resigned today.
He was like the son I never had.
He recommended you as his replacement.
I told you not to worry.
Go to the pharmacy.
Get me children's paracetamol.
And one of those rubber teething rings
for babies.
- It's for the kid.
- Sure.
Congratulations.
It's for my son's son, idiot!
I'm a grandfather.
Congratulations on your new job.
How are you doing?
Got a girlfriend or not yet?
Was there anything else, sir?
Do you think you're special?
Answer me, boy!
No, sir.
You think you're really special?
You think you have talent?
That's why you got that grant?
You are nothing.
Ever wondered
why we seek out people like you?
We helped you
so you could help us.
Maybe your friend,
the village Imam,
helped us to find you.
No, you're not better than the others.
I took a huge risk to save your skin.
Give me something.
Anything.
Today he asked me
to buy baby things
for his son's son.
So?
He doesn't have a son.
I need you to go downtown
this evening.
I want McDonald's.
Everyone says that the meat
in their burgers is halal.
Get me two Big Macs,
French fries, and extra ketchup.
If anyone sees you,
say it's for you.
He just wants me
to get him McDonald's.
I'll drive you.
Let's go.
We just passed McDonald's.
Sir...
'Evening.
Colonel Ibrahim, I called you.
Come in, Colonel.
Do come in, sir.
Welcome. Come on in.
Come into the living room.
Come in, sir.
Um Reem is
Sheikh Durani's housemaid.
Sit down.
God protect him,
he's a man of God,
he gives us all we need.
What will you drink?
- We won't stay.
- Hibiscus or Pepsi?
- It won't take long.
- OK.
Here you are, sir.
Here, sir.
How are you, Reem?
My name is Ibrahim.
Can I hold him?
He needs changing.
You're so cute!
May God protect him.
What a beautiful baby.
We need to talk to your daughter.
I'll leave you to it.
May God protect you.
Who's the father, Reem?
Please, sir, don't ask me that.
Don't be afraid.
No one will hurt you.
Sheikh Durani is a great man.
He's like a father to me,
we lack nothing.
It was my fault.
Will they take him away?
Listen, Reem.
If you shut up,
no one will take him.
Understand?
Let's go.
Goodbye, Reem.
What's wrong?
I don't believe what she said.
How can she be sure
Durani is the father?
He took her virginity.
How do you know that?
Thanks to you.
You found out his secret.
After I saw you, I did some research.
I found out you were right.
Sheikh Durani has no son.
He only has girls.
He married Reem in secret.
Bought her that place.
Do you think he did it
out of kindness?
Why do you tell me all this?
You'll make sure that Durani
doesn't become the next Grand Imam.
Just a second.
This world is in decline.
The signs of Judgment Day
can be seen.
Ignorance of religion has spread,
denial of the precepts of religion,
and attacks
on the Prophet's way of life.
The spread of obscenity,
usury,
and bank interest,
the consumption of alcohol
and amusement...
The house of Islam is on fire
and burning down.
The Muslim Brotherhood,
the Salafists...
Daesh...
all seek to burn the house of Islam
to the ground.
And women appear
stark naked in the street.
And the hypocrites
are more credible to outsiders
than true believers
who are being accused of lying
and criticizing conventions.
- Goodnight.
- You too.
Come in.
Good evening, honorable Sheikh.
Aren't you Sheikh Durani's
new assistant?
I need to share something with you.
I don't like gossip, boy.
He got a girl pregnant.
A girl his children's age.
Through an act of sin.
The next Grand Imam,
the father of an illegitimate child?
If what you claim is true...
it would destroy
Al-Azhar's reputation.
I refuse to accuse Sheikh Durani.
I'll do it, sir.
You?
Who are you? Who would listen to you?
He would.
Who are you working for?
Sheikh Durani, sir.
Sheikh Durani...
Good evening.
Dammit!
You messed up. You wise ass!
Zizo was your informant, wasn't he?
That's why he's dead.
He was killed.
Did you kill him?
Tariq Ibn-Ziyad
never burned any boats.
It's a myth spread by his enemies.
In fact, he didn't own any boats.
He borrowed them
from a Spanish nobleman.
His men wouldn't have won
if they'd been afraid.
They fought
because they believed in victory.
I want guarantees.
Sure.
I guarantee...
that if you fail,
you'll wish what happened to Zizo
happens to you.
Honorable Sheikh...
You're next in line
to be the Grand Imam.
Some people
don't want that to happen.
Why take the blame for the accident?
Your president...
the President of the Republic,
if he could, he'd declare himself
the next Grand Imam.
Zizo was your informant, wasn't he?
It wasn't an accident.
On Judgment Day,
the killer will carry his victim
on his back for eternity.
19TH INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FORUM
We are following procedure.
We are in no hurry.
Can you tell us
if Sheikh Negm is still alive?
Rumors on the internet
claim State Security arrested him
to prevent him from becoming
the next Grand Imam.
Just rumors!
This is a religious conference.
A religious conference!
Rumors have no place here.
What's your question?
I have...
a question about secret marriage.
Ask your question.
If a young woman...
Let's call her... Reem,
has a child
with a married man
of spotless reputation.
My question is: Can we trust
a man who has a secret marriage...
and has a child
his legitimate family
doesn't know about?
What does...
Islam say...
about such a man?
That's an excellent question.
Who on the Council
would want to address this?
Sheikh Durani?
Will you answer?
Well...
Sheikh Abdel Qader
has written extensively
about secret marriage.
Thank you, Sheikh.
It depends on the circumstances.
First of all,
has the girl's guardian
approved the marriage?
Secondly,
does the man have the resources
to enter into wedlock
in any other way?
Thirdly,
were they married
before or after
the child was conceived?
Some people...
in Parliament want...
Al-Sheikh Omar Al-Beblawi.
Al-Sheikh Omar Al-Beblawi.
Bless the chair.
Praise God!
Actually,
it's not about me.
It goes much further.
The main thing is that religion
and state work side by side.
What's good for Al-Azhar
is good for the state.
And vice versa.
Holy water from Zamzam.
May we drink it together in Mecca.
I see a very bright future for you.
Come in.
Put that down.
Say hello to Major General Sobhy,
head of State Security.
Adam is a model
of the ideal student.
I try my best, sir.
I'll unpack the books
after your meeting.
No, no.
You're not unpacking books anymore.
Another student will do it.
You shall stand behind me
at Friday prayer.
OK?
OK, thank you.
Adam, did we meet before?
God created for each
40 doubles, sir.
At the moment,
all over the internet,
there are calls to demonstrate
against the government
for greater freedom.
My response to this
is that civil war
is more serious than murder.
You're welcome, sir.
Don't mention it.
Congratulations, sir.
- The President is very pleased.
- Thank God.
What's this?
The report, sir.
No, that won't work.
The Blind Sheikh can't be the killer.
He's blind!
But he confessed.
What does he want?
I'm not sure.
Shouldn't we inform the General?
No, it's not a big matter.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Your "angel".
We don't need him anymore.
Get rid of him.
Sir, that's a bit over the top.
Over the top?
You know very well,
we don't like loose ends.
Make him confess he killed Zizo.
Then, we'll hang him.
Bring him in.
Where's your mom?
She's sleeping.
Did you do your homework?
What'll we eat if she's sleeping?
You carried out
your mission perfectly.
I'm here to arrest you.
Will I see my family again?
I don't think so.
We don't decide our own fate.
God chose you.
You chose me.
Leave the university.
There's only 3 weeks' classes left.
Go home.
And forget you ever met me.
Major General Sobhy?
I'm sorry to bother you this late.
My informant has gone missing.
I assure you he has.
I only know his first name: Raeed.
I know it's unbelievable,
but it's what's happened, sir.
Of course, sir.
Very well. Goodbye.
Hey, sardine, can we meet up?
Raeed
'Evening.
Goodnight.
Don't be afraid.
Let's keep it simple.
You killed Zizo.
Understood?
Some think...
they can stay silent.
We pull out their nails...
but they still won't talk.
Do you know when they do?
When we bring in their father...
to witness the torture.
Not a pretty sight!
Open the door!
Is your dad home?
Dad!
What is it?
There's someone here to talk to you.
Who?
I don't know.
Go inside!
What is it, Osman?
You must come with us.
It's a bit late...
OK, come in.
Want to bring some food?
No, don't bother.
I found him.
Your "angel".
Calm down.
Touch a hair on his head,
and I'll kill you!
He's still alive.
Damn you!
God, forgive me.
Damn you, Sobhy.
I don't understand.
Why do you care about him?
We still need him.
For what?
He's nothing.
You sent your men to kill Zizo.
Why?
He was compromised.
There must be no link between us.
Why wasn't I informed?
For your own sake, stupid!
The Blind Sheikh knows
Zizo was my informant!
He also knows that we killed him.
He confessed to the crime
to expose us.
We kill him too.
The Blind Sheikh?
Are you insane?
You need the General's permission.
What the hell am I doing here?
Sir, we killed Zizo Albizri.
Sir, I tried to tell him...
Shut your trap!
Sir, I know
it's a politically delicate solution.
But the Blind Sheikh
forced us to arrest him
for Zizo's murder.
Forced us?
And where is he now?
He's here, sir.
In the building?
God have mercy on us all.
What if he disappeared? Forever!
You want...
me to be complicit in the murder
of one of the country's
greatest religious leaders?
No, sir.
Sir...
the boy helped us
elect the Grand Imam.
He could convince the Blind Sheikh
to retract his confession.
And we'll write it off
as an accident.
Please leave us.
Sit down.
You know that...
the Blind Sheikh
confessed to the murder
of the foreign student?
He didn't do it, sir.
State Security killed him, sir.
He was their informant,
but he wanted out.
But why would...
the Blind Sheikh
confess to a crime
he didn't commit?
To tell the whole world
the truth at his trial.
He could have gone to the media.
But he knows who controls the media.
Well...
could the son of a fisherman
make him change his mind?
He could try, sir.
Why would he do that?
Al-Azhar and the state
should never be in conflict.
That could lead to civil war.
I need your advice, Sheikh.
They made me confess
to Zizo's murder.
And I'll be hanged for it.
A true believer doesn't fear death.
I know that.
I am a believer.
But I'm afraid.
I'm afraid for my father.
He will lose his son.
My brothers will lose me,
as we lost our mother.
If your faith is strong...
and your heart pure,
you'll meet her in Paradise
one day.
What if you confess to a murder
you did not commit?
Will you go to Paradise?
If the confession is
to expose the truth,
then the intention is good.
I thought God created us
to carry out His wishes.
Not to change them.
I flee from the fate God gave me,
to carry out His wishes.
When Omar Bin Al Khattab was told
Prophet Mohammad had died,
he pulled out his sword:
"I will kill anyone who says
that Mohammad is dead."
But Abu Bakr replied:
"Whoever worships Mohammad
knows that Mohammad is dead.
Whoever worships God
knows that God is immortal."
Who are you exactly?
I'm your student.
You're no longer a student.
You don't need anyone
to teach you your religion.
Tell the people outside that I am...
retracting my confession.
Power is a double-edged sword.
It can easily cut
your own hand.
- Welcome home.
- How are you?
I'm fine. What's new?
- Hello, father.
- Welcome home, son.
If only your mother were here
to see you!
You're back!
Congratulations!
Welcome home.
Thank God.
Thank God...
What have you learned?
