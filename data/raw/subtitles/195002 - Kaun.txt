Mother, I'm very scared.
What do you mean? 
Why don't you try to come?
All right... 
Fine,I'll manage, mama.
Yes, I know that there's
food kept in the fridge.
You've mentioned this ten times
in a span of 5 minutes!
I'll eat when I feel hungry.
But, mama, why did all of you
go there in these heavy showers?
Do you know, it's raining
very heavily here also?
I'm feeling scared, staying
alone at home.
Please come back as
soon as possible.
Yes#
Yes, I will check all
the doors and windows.
But, please return as
soon as possible.
'Who is the in-charge here? '
'Mrs. Bimla Mathur was tied
to a chair and murdered...
...when she was alone at home.'
The police say that even this...
...is the handiwork of
the same murderer...
...who has killed three people
in the last one month.'
'The police also say that this
person is mentally unbalanced...
...because he only commits
a murder; he does not steal.'
He first makes an excuse
to enter the house...
...' and then kills the person.'
The police appeals
to the public...
...' to disallow any stranger
in their house.'
'And if they doubt anybody...
...they should contact
this number at once.'
'40021, 40022.'
'And now, for the
weather report.'
'Due to incessant rains, the
city has come to a standstill...'
Sherry! Evil cat! Do you know,
you're scaring me?
Do you dream? Do you...
We will now eat something...
what will we eat?
And you will not get anything
because you always startle me.
What will you eat? I will not
prepare a sandwich for you! No# 
Who is it?
Oh! Hi! Is Mr. Malhotra at home?
Who?!
Mr. Malhotra? There is
no Mr. Malhotra here.
What?Isn't this B/41, Anandi,
Hilton Road?
Yes, the address is correct.
Then, Mr. Malhotra lives here.
I'm telling you there's
no Mr. Malhotra here.
This is Mr. Gupta's house.
Gupta# Who's Mr. Gupta?
What do you mean by that?!
This is Mr. G.H. Gupta's house.
Why will Mr. Malhotra give
me Mr. Gupta's address?
Go and ask him! 
Why are you asking me?!
Yeah, exactly! He's the one; 
I have come to meet.
There you go again!
I'm telling you this once and
for all.
This is Mr. Malhotra's house;
there is no Mr. Gupta.
I mean yes, this is B/41, Anandi,
Hilton Road.
But this is Mr. Gupta's house; there
is no Mr. Malhotra! Please go away!
Does this look like Mr. Malhotra's
house, Sherry?
What's it?
Ma'm# Can I make a phone call 
please?
No, our phone is dead.
- Isn't there another phone?
- No. And this one is dead.
What’s the problem?
What do you mean?!
No# I mean, what's the problem
with the phone?
What problem can there be with 
the phone?! It's dead! That'it#
Ma'm# I wanted to make an urgent
phone call. Please Ma'm#
So... So what can I do?
Isn't there a phone?
I've told you there's no other 
phone and mine is dead!That's it#
No# No# I mean, isn't there a
phone in the vicinity?
How do I know? Go and
see for yourself!
Ma'm# You live here, so you will 
know about this area, right?
No, I don't know#
No, I don't know anything!
Go and see for yourself! Please go 
away! Why're you getting angry Ma'm#
Sherry# Where are you?
After this, I will...
What’s it now?
Ma'm# My car has broken down.
I don't know what's the problem Ma'm#
It’s pouring heavily outside,
Ma'm so may I come inside?
No Ma'm# I'll leave as soon as the
rains stop... I promise.
No Ma'm# I mean, it’s raining cats 
and dogs outside and it's very cold.
Despite wearing this jacket,
I am feeling very cold Ma'm!
So, may I come in? 
Ma'm# That's if you say so.
Look, if it’s so cold...
...then why don't you go
and sit inside your car?
I don't understand why
you are harassing me!
Great idea# Why are you always the one
to think? Why can't I do the same?
He's a strange man! He's been
harassing me since so long!
- What’s it now?! - Ma'm# My 
key is locked inside my car!
Meaning?
- Ma'm# The key remained inside 
the car. - So what am I to do?
No# You had asked me to sit in 
the car if I was feeling cold.
I went there, but the key is
inside. S...So, may I come inside?
Ma'm# Hello#
I am right here!
Ma'm# May I come inside?
Look# My husband is sleeping upstairs.
He won't accept me letting
a stranger in!
- Then ask him. - I've told
you, he's sleeping!
Wake him, I'll speak to him.
I cannot wake him up! In fact...
I cannot do anything for you.
Please# You have harassed me enough!
Now, please leave!
Am I harassing you? I'm feeling
cold, and I'm harassing you?!
Ma'm# You are very mean.
A man who comes home...
...is like a guest, and
a guest is like God#
I am famished. Can I get something 
to eat? Please Ma'm#
You can't come like this!
You're amazing!
Look Ma'm# I'm sorry. Even I'm ashamed
to say this, but what to do?
Ma'm# I don't look like
a beggar, do I?
Please give me something to eat.
It's ok# Stay there. 
Don't move ahead. I'll give you.
- Don't move ahead! - As if I'll
come through the window!
Don't move ahead# Take this.
Cheese Sandwich# You are very nice.
Who says you are mean? Thank you Ma'm#
Now...You were the only left
to frighten me!
Sherry, Sorry Baby# 
We'll watch TV now.
We'll watch TV, and eat 
sandwiches,right? Sit here.
What’s it now?
Ma'm# I rang the bell only to thank
you for giving me a sandwich.
You've made it very well!
Do you know Ma'm#, preparing a 
cheese sandwich is also an art?
Ma'm# The sandwich you have 
prepared is out of this world!
No Ma'm# I love sandwiches.
My mother prepares it for me.
You have put the right amount 
of cheese!Thank you, Ma'm#
Cheese from Paris! You
don't get it in Poona.
It must be the wonder of your
hand! It’s so delicious!
Sherry# My baby's gone to sleep?
Won't she watch TV?
Ma'm...May I watch the television?
Ma'm# If I watch TV, I'll forget
about the cold. Please Ma'm#
Ok Ma'm# Fine! If you don't want
to draw the curtain...
...at least increase the television's volume.
I'll think it’s the radio playing.
Ha# Ha# Ha# Ha#
This is Radio Ceylon.
In this music programme
of listeners' choice...
...we'll first listen to
the request of Mr. Poonawala.
He's got caught...
...in a place named
Hilton Road due...
...to the heavy showers and cold.
He sends his request,
and sings...
'It's raining it's raining...#'
'My heart weeps... '
It's ok# Watch the TV.
What are you watching?
Ma'm# The TV.
You were watching me just now!
I swear Ma'm#
I was watching the TV.
You are lying! I saw
you look at me!
No Ma'm, I was watching the TV.
You turned to look at me,
and I did the same.
And then, you saw
me look at you.
Otherwise, I was
watching the TV.
It's ok# Now, Watch the TV.
Ma'm# Just see if your husband
has got up...
Meaning?!
I mean, if he's got up, then
send him down; I'll speak to him.
Look# If he gets up, he will
come down, won't he?!
Ma'm# Ma'm# Don't mind it# 
Your husband is sleeping at this hour?!
Meaning?!
- I mean, it’s...
It's quarter past six Ma'm, and he's
sleeping?! Is he feeling fine?
He... is...He's perfectly fine!
He's perfectly fine!
And then, he can sleep at 12.15PM,3.15PM,
6.15PM,or any time he wants to!!!
Why are you bothered?!
Everybody's driving me crazy!
I am here# I am here!
I am right here! 
- Ma'm# Your man has got up. - Who?
Your husband!
How do you know?
I saw him at the
window upstairs, Ma'm#.
What’s wrong?! - Somebody's
upstairs! - That’s your husband.
My husband is not here;
I am all alone!
You'd said that your
husband was at home!
- I lied. - You did?
- Then who is he?
- I don't know. - You don't?
This is your house! How come
you don't know who's here?!
Yes, this is my house only, but
I don't know who's upstairs!
Is it a thief?
- I don't know.
Ma'm# Shall I... I check?
Don't be afraid.
Easy!
- Which way? - From there.
Upstairs.
- Ma'm# There's nobody here. 
- What?! Noone is there#
Yes, there's nobody here. You
were unnecessarily frightened.
- But how can this be? 
- I searched everywhere.
Nobody's here.
But what about the loud noise?
It must have been a cat.
My cat was in front of me downstairs!
Really? Would it be hiding
beneath the floor then?!Ma'm#
Meaning?! You're too much. You
said you saw someone upstairs!
Ma'm# I never said I saw someone.
I only said that...
...I saw the curtain move...
...and it could’ve been
caused by the wind too!
The wind? You don't understand.
It’s not because you said so.
Since morning, I've been feeling
that there's somebody home!
Look Ma'm# This is a figment of
your imagination!
- What! - Yes.
Look Ma'm# When I rang the bell
the first time...
...you'd said, your husband
was at home.
Look Ma'm# I knew that there was nobody
home, that you were alone.
In your solitude, you
kept imagining things!
About a ghost, a thief, a
murderer with a stone...
You are wrong! This is not a
figment of my imagination!
I had heard the sound
for myself...myself...
Ma'm# Look# I didn't want to tell you but,
I think I don't have a choice now.
What is it?
Ma'm# Actually, I threw a stone
and broke the window pane.
Ma'm# Please understand.
Ma'm# You were not letting me in,
and it was so cold out.
So I thought, if
I hit a stone...
...at least your husband
would wake up.
Ma'm# Please listen to me.
Ma'm# Put yourself in my shoes,
and think for a while.
You were alone here,
so terrified.
I was wondering how
to tell you about it.
Do you understand Ma'm#?
Ma'm# I'll bear the cost of the glass.
Or I'll get a worker,
and have it fixed.
You need not worry. Okay?
Can I sit here Ma'm# I'm dry.
Ma'm# Don't look at me, like I
am going to eat you raw!
Ma'm# I will not do anything.
Ma'm# May I make a request? 
I know you will be angry.
But I am feeling so cold!
Can I get a cup of coffee?
Ma'm# One cup, please!
One spoon sugar.
Ma'm# The house is beautiful!
Ma'm# I was only looking at it because
my mother has a similar one.
Ma'm# Did you think I was
going to kill you?
Do I look like a
murderer to you?
- Do I... - What the hell
are you doing here?!
I thought I ordered
you to bring coffee.
Then I felt I should
help you, so I came...
There is no need! You should
not have come here!
Look# Here goes your knife.
I have no knife now.
I've been reiterating that you
should not have come here!
My mother says that I look like
Anil Kapoor-a film star.
'Hello. The main stories
of the day.'
'The Indian delegation will

It’s good. Please sit.
Please sit. Please sit#
- Make yourself at home.
Please sit. Sit. Please sit#
'And now, for an
important news.'
'The commissioner spoke
of the spate... '
'... of murders in the
last few days.'
- Won't you have some coffee?
- I don't drink coffee.
You don't? But you prepare
coffee very well.
'After conducting the
investigations, he found out...
...that these murders are the
handiwork of only one person.'
' Because he has murdered
all his victims... '
'... by quashing them
with a rope.'
'Perhaps, he is mentally
unbalanced.'
'The officer has appealed
to the public...
"...not to let any
stranger home.'
'He has also said
that if a person... '
'... is suspicious about
somebody...
...he should kindly contact
this number - 400021, 400022.'
'The terrorism that people
have faced in Kashmir...
Do you think it’s me?
M'am# Do you actually feel that
I am the murderer?!
I think you ought to leave now.
What’s wrong now?
Means what? My husband will 
be here any moment!
But you said you
have no husband.
I'd said he isn't at home now...
...he's gone out. He'll
be here any time.
Please go!
Oh, that's great! 
Let him come, I'll speak to him.
What do you mean?!
Let him come. I'll explain to
him, and he'll understand.
There is no need! Please
go now! This is my house!
Hmmm# It’s a nice house.
This is no time to joke!
Please go!
I'm telling you for
the last time!
Suppose I say, I will
not go, then?
I let you come inside,
gave you coffee.
I heeded everything you said.
Please go! I beg# I beg...
Sssh# Quiet!
Look Ma'm# I am really a decent
man. Understand?
I've got caught in
this thunderstorm...
...because of that
wretched Mr. Malhotra!
Look# I can understand your fear.
You've got trapped at
home with a stranger.
Ok# I can understand everything.
Ma'm# Do you think I am that murderer?
Would you have been
yet alive then?!
Would you have been alive now?!
Keep this! Keep it.
Keep this! Keep it.
Sit here with it. If I do
anything, then kill me, okay?
Happy? But for Gods sake,
please be quiet! Happy now?
You have made a ghost out
of a man in just a second!
Look# I swear I'll leave 
once the rains stop.
I don't want to stay here!
I have a home of my own!
Weird girl!
Now# Sit straight.
Looking at you,I remember Aarti.
Aarti, my girlfriend#
You are just like her.
Absolutely chicken-hearted!!!
When she'd be alone in a room...
...she'd feel someone is
coming to garrote her.
Any sound or thing
would startle her.
Very absent-minded! Very much#
If we would go for a film, she
would not travel in a taxi.
And if by some chance,
she would...
...then she'd constantly be giving
directions to the driver!
I had a good time with her...
Then she died.
I am sorry# No, I am really sorry#
I used to love her very much.
I have never loved anybody
with that intensity.
- What do you do? - Me?
- Yes -You?
- I...I...I'm studying.
- What? - H...H...History.
History! My God!
Ok# Shall I tell you a
joke about History?
There was a History student who
entered his classroom late.
His teacher summoned him,
and asked him if knew
where Qutub-Minar was.
He replied in the negative.
The teacher asked him
to stand on the bench.
To which he asked,
'Sir, will I be able to see
it, standing on a bench? '
Had you done the same?
And what does your husband do?
- My husband is not here. - No?
I mean, I am not married.
I knew that!
I hate cats... especially
those who like cats!
Aarti used to like cats.
She used to call it Catty. Catty# 
Hey Catty Baby# Sorry Baby#
I think there's
been a power cut.
Has someone outside
cut the line?
Hey! I was only joking!
Ma'm# Hello Ma'm#
Please bring a candle.
Or we'll be just searching for
each other's faces in the dark!
Ma'm# Did you find the candle?
Ma'm# What’s the matter? 
Please wait.
Ma'm# What’s wrong?
Ma'm# Ma'm# What’s wrong?!
Ma'm# Ma'm! What is the matter?!
This man is a murderer!
He will kill me!
Don't be afraid.
This is the Police!!!
This man killed my cat!
He'll kill me too!
Ma'm# What are...
- Where is the cat? Inside!
- Inside,in the kitchen.
Inside! Go inside! Ma'm# Ma'm.
Get inside# Get inside!
I was downstairs#. I had suspected 
him all along. When I went upstairs...
Say Sorry you punk# Why are you hitting
me? What do you think# 
Look Ma'm# No Ma'm# No Ma'm#
I didn't go to the kitchen...
I know# I know everything# 
I know he has killed my cat!
Ma'm# I did not... I didn't#
No Ma'm# What're you doing?
Look over there# 
Look, there's my cat!
- But I did not kill it! M'am# I didn't 
- He killed my cat!
Listen to me Ma'm! 
Ma'm# I was not even here!
I suspected him from the beginning!
Right from the beginning
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.
- Then what’s he doing in your
house? - I don't know!
He kept asking for Mr. Malhotra,
and barged in!
- Who's Mr. Malhotra?
- I don't know.
-No# No# I'll tell you! 
-Just shut up, okay?!
Look Sir# I know Mr. Malhotra. 
I had a deal with him.
I came here for a delivery.
But to the wrong address.
- Does he know Mr. Malhotra?
- I don't know that!
Look Sir# Why are you asking her?
I'm telling you, I had
a deal with Mr. Malhotra.
Hey Mr. Hero# Be quiet!
Sir# There is no Mr. Malhotra!
He is the murderer! The murderer#
The one shown in the
news bulletin.
He has murdered, and
is on the run!
Look Sir# This stupid, crazy girl 
is talking rubbish!
Why are you listening to her?
Then  what# You want me to listen to
you instead! Who do you think you're?
Whom are you trying to impress?
Whom are you trying to impress#
What kind of impressions# 
I'll blow your brains apart!
Whom are you threating#
Whom are you threatening?
She's speaking the truth,
and I'm telling lies?!
Perhaps, this house is mine!
Perhaps, this girl has barged in!
Perhaps, I didn't kill the cat,
and this girl did!!
You may have killed it! 
Or somebody else may have!
Just a minute...
What were you doing
outside the house?
This is not your house.
It’s raining incessantly. 
Why were you near the door?
Nobody has informed the police.
How did you come here?
Sit...
Sit!!!
Sit there, please.
Is it Panvel? This is Inspector
Qureshi speaking.
Send a Head Constable and four
sepoys to Anandi, Hilton Road.
No. It’s a case of some
suspect killer.Yes
Look. There's a car parked outside
your compound...
...in the middle of the road.
And, I came to inquire
if it was yours.
I was going to ring the bell
when you opened the door.
The story is good!
It’s indeed a very good story!!
When I asked him then,
he had no answer.
He walked till here, cooked up
a story, and told us. Very good#
You are amazing! 
This man is absolutely crazy!
Didn't he phone the
police station now?!
You are crazy and stupid!
Can't you understand this?!
How would you know
if he phoned...
...or if there was someone
on the other end?
Just look at him!
Look# He's sitting, like this
is his house, not yours!
And he's drinking liquor!
Will a cop do so, and
that too before a lady?
- Look at his clothes.
- Ask him where his uniform is!
It looks like he has run away
from a film shooting!
And look at his shoes!
As if he has stolen the shoes of 
(actor Anil Kapoor) or some hoodlum!
And you've studied History.
Don't History students
possess any kind of brains?!
A word more, and I'll
blow your brains apart!
Let go of him!
Ma'm# This man is dangerous!
Move away! Let go of him!
Move away! Let go of him!
Don't you move!
Ma'm# If he is a policeman, what
was he doing outside?
You shut up! Move away!
I had parked my car on the side of
the road Ma'm, not in the centre.
Don't believe him!
My spectacles! 
My spectacles!
Give me the gun!
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd have smashed the
glass and entered in.
I wouldn't have killed the cat,
I would have killed you!
Ma'm# Please listen to me!
Ma'm# No, listen to me!
Ma'm# Believe me, and not this man!
Please listen to me!
Use your head, Ma'm.
- Please give me the gun! - No!
- You point a gun at a cop...
- Don't move ahead!
Don't move ahead!
Don't move ahead!
- I don't believe either of you!
- Go and sit there!
- I will. - Sit!
Ma'm# I'm not doing anything.
Sit down!!!
Please listen to me...
You are making a grave mistake.
I'm a policeman.
If he is a policeman, then I'm
the super-star Amitabh Bachchan!
- I'll kill you, swine!
- I'll shoot both of you!
Ma'm# Point it towards him, he's
hitting me... Move that side!
If I had the gun, I wouldn't
have spared you!
I thrashed you so badly.
Don't you remember?!
Remember every word you say!
I'll remember even what I have
not said! Take your hand off!
You stink! Since how many
days have you not bathed?
Shall I bathe you thoroughly?!
- Bloody swine!
He must have not informed the
police. Let me do the needful.
No! Don't move!
Ok Ma'm# Fine! 
You phone.
She's going to call
your father... Look!
Hello Mama# Two people have 
barged in here! I'm fine, mama.
Phone the police immediately,
and ask them to come here soon!
I am fine, mama! 
Please phone them immediately!
We will now know in which
division you are. Understand?!
Can't you see he's crazy?! And
you are falling for his bait?!
I don't believe either of you!
Let the police come and decide
about each one of you!
Ok Ma'm# Ok Ma'm#
I understand. I understand#
When you'll learn about whom
you've messed around with...
...you'll run home...
...straight to your mother, and
ask her for a bottle of milk...
Swine, do you know whom you
have messed around with?!
Constable, you are frightening me! 
I know the truth...
My friends uncle is
Commissioner Mendonca!
Hey Commissioner! Don't laugh!
These are your last moments!
I'll thrash you so badly that
you'll be given saline!
Really? Well, you'll be
given a glucose water drip!
I'll come to visit you, don't worry!
Both of you# Stay away from each other!
Or else,I'll shoot both of you!
Stay away from each other
until the police arrive!
I'll shoot both of you!
You'll drive me crazy!
Even the ghost won't go near
him, so why should I Ma'm?
Stop it! What are you doing?!
I need a Cigarette#
Ma'm# Shall I...
Did you buy it from Andheri
railway station?
Can I have one?
I am sorry! Sorry#
Can I have some coffee?
No# I mean, we have to wait
till the police come.
We are sitting idle, so
let's have some coffee.
What do you say? Not a 
bad idea. Very good#
Ma'm# Let’s do one thing.
We'll walk ahead of you...
...while you point the gun 
towards our backs? Ok Ma'm?
We'll prepare coffee, and then
get it back here, okay Ma'm?
However, there's one problem. I
can't prepare coffee... Can you?
Yes I can# Why delay? 
Let’s go, Ma'm.
You# Stay behind Ma'm.
Shall I shut this window?
Yes#
- Is there a dish?
- What’s that?
- A vessel. 
- A pan.
It’s there.
It's there#
-Where's the coffee powder? -It is
here... Wait! One of you come.
Take this.
What’s this?! You have to
prepare coffee, not tea.
- Can you prepare coffee? 
- No.
So... Then?!
- What’s the matter? 
- No# I'm not laughing at you.
I just remembered that when
I had just come here...
...even I'd asked for coffee.
Ma'm, move ahead.
Please# Move ahead Ma'm#
Ma'm# I won't harm you! I 
hate to point the gun at you.
But what to do? 
You just don't believe me.
I had told you, he's crazy!
Come on you bastard#
Ma'm# You felt that he was a nice 
man, and I was bad, didn't you?
Ma'm# Just use your head!
Please Ma'm# Listen Ma'm#
You are a policeman, aren't you?
You bastard# In which police
station do you work?!
Answer me, or I'll shoot you!
Panvel# Panvel#
Panvel# Panvel! 
Give me the phone number in Panvel!
Quickly tell me the number!
7458634# 7458634# 7458634. 
Repeat it! 7458634# 7458634#
Dial the number, Ma'm.
Dial the number 7458634#
Is Inspector Qureshi there?
Inspector Quereshi! Quereshi#
He... he says, there's no
inspector named Qureshi!
Oh my God!
He is the same killer!
You lied to me! Bastard#
You were lying!
I have the gun now! Don't move!
Ma'm, phone the police...
...and say that the television
killer is here...
- I'll kill you!
- Kill me!
There were only 4 bullets, you fool!
Mummy# Mummy#
Look Madam# You have nothing  to 
fear from me... I am only a thief.
I came to steal... I don't know
anything about the murderer.
I don't want to fall
in this mess!
Do you have a rope?
Rope? Why?!
Look# I can't let this madman loose.
If I do, he'll kill you!
I'll tie him for your safety.
Bring a rope. I want to leave.
Ma'm! Ma'm# My suspicion has been
confirmed! He is the murderer!
You don't believe me? Fine,
I'll leave! You can go and die!
No! Please# Please! 
I'll fetch the rope!
Come here!
Come out soon!
Bloody swine! Swine#
Can't you remain shut?!
Sit! Don't# 
Please listen to me.
Please listen to me#
I believe that you are a thief,
and not a murderer.
Ok... Ok# I...I
I take back my words.
But why do you think,
I am the murderer?!
Does one murder with spectacles
on? Look at my tie and clothes!
And would I kill a cat if I
wanted to murder someone?!
This crazy foolish girl doesn't
realise that...
...I’ll be killed because
of her fear!
Look# Listen to me. I came here,
looking out for Mr. Malhotra.Ok?
And I got trapped.
I've hurt my head; look at
the state of my clothes!
M...y...My entire night has got ruined!
I had sought shelter from 
the rains.You understand#
And# You came here to steal...
...so we are birds of the
same feather, right?
I came to look for Mr. Malhotra.
So what’s the difference
between us?
Both of us have got trapped.
Now look, I pleaded with the 
girl for an hour to let me in.
How was I to know that my whole
life would get destroyed?!
I'm... I am ruined! 
Hey... Hey#
I hurt my head! And now# 
Everything is finished!
And now look, she's bringing a rope!
Ma'm# I had no choice.
Ma'm# If I wouldn't have killed him,
he'd have killed us Ma'm!
Understand Ma'm?
Ma'm# Please believe me!
Ma'm# You think I'm the murderer!
Ma'm# I'll call the police.
They will decide who this man is!
Just wait!
This hoodlum has ruined my life!
I should get out from
here quickly...
...as I don't want to stay here!
This is an ill-fated place!
I don't want to stay here#
I'll tell the police everything!
Come On! Come on you bastard#
Everything is faulty here!
Come on# Come on#
I'll tell them everything.
Where is this wire coming from?
I fail to understand the
technology of this...
It’s snapped!
But when Ma'm phoned...
...that man(thief) was in front of me.
He didn't cut it. If it was
already cut, then who phoned?
This means there is 
somebody else over here!
Ma'm# Ma'm! Stay where 
you are! I'm coming Ma'm!
Ma'm# There is somebody else here!
Ma'm# Beware! There is somebody here!
Stay where you are, I'm here!
Whoever you are, come out!
I have a pistol!
Ma'm. Stay where you are!
Ma'm, I'm coming!
Whoever you are, you can't 
escape! Swine#
Ma'm. Stay where you are! 
There is somebody else here!
You won't be spared, scoundrel!
Ma'm# Stay where you are! 
There is somebody else here!
Ma'm# Don't worry, I have a pistol.
Ma'm look! There is somebody here M'am.
Hey, whoever you are,
I have a pistol...
Ma'm. Listen to me.
Ma'm. Please listen to me#
- Please don't kill me! Please -
Here's the gun. Listen to me.
Look# There's something 
spooky here, understand? Ma'm#
That man was a murderer Ma'm.
I had to kill him Ma'm or
he'd have killed us!
- He would have killed us!
- You'll kill me!
Didn't you hear on TV that...
...the killer strangles
a victim to death?
- Don't kill me! - Didn't
you see on TV?
Ma'm look# Listen to me.
I haven't come here to play
a joke or hurt my head.
You have to lend me a hand.
We've got to be together.
I have a pistol,
else that man#...
Ma'm# Listen to me. 
Stay right here! Someone's come...
...but I have a pistol.
Don't worry# Stay here#
Ma'm, somebody was asking
for Mr. Malhotra.
Yes Ma'm# 7458634#. He asked about Mr. Malhotra.
I opened the door. He saw my
face, my bloodstained shirt...
...my injured head, a
pistol... He then ran away.
Ma'm# Why was he asking
about Mr. Malhotra?
Ma'm# This is Gupta's house, isn't it?
Ma'm# I think there is something 
spooky, something really spooky!
Why was he asking for
Mr. Malhotra in Mr. Gupta's...
Look Ma'm# So, when I was 
asking you for Mr. Malhotra...
...this man must have been
hiding somewhere here.
Ma'm# Some game is being played
with us. Stay right here.
How did he know about Mr. Malhotra?
I was asking for Mr. Malhotra.
This means, that man must 
have been somewhere inside!
That man was inside!
Ma'm#, we should be together.
I have a pistol. There is
certainly something spooky#.
Ma'm# There is certainly
something spooky#. Ma'm#
You# Stay with me. Look Ma'm#
I have stayed back to save you.
Else, I have no desire of...
Ma'm# Ma'm# 
I think she will surely
drive me crazy!
- I hurt my head.
Why did I ever come here?!
Ma'm, please! I'll go away!
Please Ma'm# Please Ma'm#
M... m... ma'm# I'll hit you!
M... m... ma'm, I'll hit you!
Ma'm# Don't come close,
or else I'll hit you!
Ma'm# I'll hit you!
Ma'm### Are you all right?
Don't be afraid.
Yes.
No No! I'll behave like a good girl!
Come back soon, mama.
Mama, I love you.
