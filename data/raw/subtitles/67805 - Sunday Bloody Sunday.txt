TeII me if you feeI anything at aII.
- Here?
- No.
- How about there?
- No.
Here?
No.
I think we ought to Iose a IittIe weight.
Why do doctors aIways say ''we''?
As if it were your pain?
No.
How about here?
That's it. My appendix side.
You shouIdn't read
those medicaI journaIs.
It's probabIy the worry
that's hurting you.
You thought you had a brain tumor once
and it was your bowIer hat.
- This does hurt.
- Yes.
I think perhaps it's a good idea
if we got you in for a few tests.
Tests? There's something criticaI?
There's nothing criticaI.
There's no question of that.
It's just in case there is coIitis.
You are hiding something from me.
I'm not hiding anything from you.
This may be nothing at aII.
Give me a moment, wiII you?
I've got to be sure, OK?
Sorry. No, I can't. I'm with a patient.
- Do you want me to Ieave?
- No, of course not.
Can I ring you back?
It shouIdn't be Iong but I can't now.
Just try and stay in for a few moments.
Can't you stay there for a few moments?
- I'm in a terribIe hurry.
- Right.
- Can we arrange tests for next week?
- I can't next week.
- I've got to go to BrusseIs.
- The week after, then.
I think I'm going to Frankfurt.
Which is more important -
the pain or Frankfurt?
I'd rather you toId me now, at this stage.
I mean...
Listen, oId friend.
It's not cancer.
- How do you know?
- Because I'm teIIing you.
My secretary wiII be
in touch with you on Monday.
PooI HoteI?
Message desk.
- What was the name?
- Dr. DanieI Hirsh.
- Oh! Dr. Hearsh!
- What were those caIIs?
Just a minute.
There was a caII from Dr. Simon,
a caII from Mrs. Burke, you have
the number, and one from Mr. EIgin.
Did Mr. EIkin say how Iong he'd be in?
He was going straight out.
He must have changed his mind.
He's in. It's engaged.
It might be someone eIse ringing him.
I know, but he needs to taIk to me
before he goes away for the weekend.
Oh, never mind.
In future, try and get his name
roughIy right. It adds a personaI touch.
It's EIkin, not EIgin or AIvin
or AIcott or Higgins.
You've been taking it Iong enough.
WiII you be picking up now?
No, I'm going out. Thank you. Goodbye.
Christ.
- HeIIo?
- Answering service?
I'm Iate. This is AIex GreviIIe.
What's the time? My watch stopped.
- It's five to six.
- Oh, no.
If Mr. EIkin shouId ring,
teII him I'm on my way
but I had to booze with a cIient
who's had the push.
I tried to ring him but he must have Ieft.
- Is the traffic bad?
- It's aIways bad here.
It wouId be different round you.
Worse, of course, Iike your weather. Bye.
Sod it!
- It's not there at aII.
- Babstock Passage.
- It's probabIy upstairs anyway.
- Excuse me.
- Is there a hat shop in here?
- I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm in a hurry.
I thought there was, dear.
Now, with the time exactIy on
the haIf-hour, Iet's go to the news room.
With Britain in the throes of its most
serious economic crisis since the war,
the cabinet wiII be in
continuous session over the weekend.
So wiII trade union Ieaders
faced with the threat
of mass unempIoyment
and miIitant unofficiaI strike action.
The sharp increase in the bank rate
and the tough new restrictions
on bank Ioans
were attacked today by the TUC,
who said that hundreds...
Let me come aIone.
I can Iook after the kids.
AIex, bring Bob.
It'II be good for you both.
- Trust me.
- AIva, AIva...
..the duty on a wide range of products.
One car manufacturer said...
283 0811. HeIIo?
HeIIo! HeIIo! HeIIo! HeIIo!
DarIing, are you stuck somewhere?
What's the matter?
I shouIdn't have said yes
to this weekend. Can Bob hear you?
I shouIdn't think so,
with aII this going on!
Timothy, you've started John Stuart off.
It wiII go fine. Look, taIk to Bob.
No, I don't want to taIk to him.
I'm sorry I've heId you up.
I was going to put the kids to bed.
They aIways go to bed at this time.
You'II have a Iie-in.
Mummy says it's nice for them
if they put us to bed together.
Bob and AIex.
AIex, don't worry, darIing. Trust me.
Lucy, don't forget to turn
the shepherd's pie down.
Have you got the other one?
AIva.
I'm so sorry.
The traffic!
- I'm so sorry.
- It reaIIy doesn't matter.
You won't be there tiII midnight.
It's better to be there Iate.
- You know Professor Johns.
- How do you do? I'm terribIy sorry.
- And how are you?
- Two bIeeding hours Iate, miss.
Don't.
He recognizes you!
Lucy, teII CarI not to eat
aII the monkey's bananas.
Bye, the Iate Miss GreviIIe.
- Papa made a joke!
- What?
Papa made a joke!
He said to AIex,
''the Iate Miss GreviIIe.''
- She is terrificaIIy Iate.
- No, darIing...
You're never Iate. What happened?
- Just couIdn't get going.
- You know he's eaten aIready.
- What?
- He onIy has one meaI a day.
Two pounds raw tomorrow.
I think I've got it.
Don't Iet the economic crisis
spoiI your weekend.
It is worrying about
the cost of Iiving index.
- Go away!
- Be a good famiIy. Bye!
Bye.
Have a good time!
Enjoy yourseIves! Bye!
Come on, dog.
DanieI Hirsh wouIdn't just turn up
this weekend, wouId he?
He knows we're away.
I never minded any of the sacrifices
God required of me...
Except one.
I was terrified he'd make me
give up footbaII.
Come here.
When you incur a penaIty...
What have you got that on for?
- I don't know.
- WeII, take it off.
It's this house.
And this room! It's so bIoody freezing!
You're Iike a IittIe fire!
I do Iove you.
WeII, thank you, sir.
Good night.
If you get up, I'II kiII you.
Yes, I'm just coming.
It's me, Lucy, just to say
I'II Iook after John Stuart for you.
She sounds Iike somebody's
mother-in-Iaw, Ioitering.
It's aII right. I'II manage.
Do you think AIva and BiII had that
disgusting octopus they gave to us?
Perhaps they'II be sick in the middIe
of the socioIogists.
- I want some miIk.
- Oh, my God!
You're getting more Iike an American.
I want some wine.
- What's this?
- I don't know.
It Iooks speciaI. I'II ask Lucy tomorrow.
Oh, I Iove AIva.
Fancy having those posters in here.
But AIva does that sort of thing.
What she wouId reaIIy, reaIIy Iike
is for us to get engaged in her bed.
Oh, my God.
She's Iike a CIA agent for happy famiIies.
And we're her guinea pigs.
Oh, no, we're not.
Are we? Oh, why did we come?
Because you're soft.
No.
Because it's a chance
for a whoIe weekend together.
You Iocked Kenyatta out
of your bedroom. He sIeeps on your bed.
- So sorry.
- I suppose you didn't mean to.
- Is this miIk aII right for Bob to drink?
- It's Mummy's.
- She wouIdn't mind, wouId she?
- It's Mummy's miIk for John Stuart.
He isn't weaned yet.
Oh, my God.
Thank you very much.
Shut up.
Come on, then. There's a good boy.
Come on, then. Come on.
Serves you right
for pinching my breakfast.
- Papa paid for it.
- There's sociaIism for you.
What does he mean?
Thank you so very much
for bringing up the tray.
Mummy said you'd Iike a Iie-in in peace.
Did she mention you
bringing the tray and staying?
We aIways come in here first thing.
Then we watch Mama and Papa
have a bath together.
Oh, my God.
There's a most pecuIiar smeII.
It's exactIy Iike p...
Are you chiIdren smoking pot?
Are you bourgeois?
I don't mind, but does Mummy know?
They keep it behind the records
so we know where it is.
Behind Tristan and IsoIde.
I suppose it doesn't matter.
- What are you doing?
- Resigning.
From my job at the office.
- SeriousIy?
- SeriousIy.
I shouId have done it ages ago.
What wiII you do instead?
It's not because of me, is it?
No, my duck, it is not because of you.
You turn everything to yourseIf.
What shaII we do with them today?
What's wrong?
Do you want to go out?
Is it so difficuIt to say that to me?
No.
Just want to go into town for a bit.
OK, fine.
But you don't have to go to work.
Oh, I see.
CouId it be...
that you are going to see someone
whose name begins with D?
- With D-A? Am I getting warm?
- Time's up.
- Back soon.
- Give me a ring.
Oh, no, you won't have time.
Have fun with...
One of the things is,
I can't stand the dirt he brings home.
- I'm so sorry.
- TeII me...
how Iong is it since you've Ied a...
normaI married Iife with him?
How Iong is it?
I can't compIain.
You mean he hasn't
been near you for a Iong time?
- Or is it that you haven't wanted him to?
- He's never forced himseIf on me.
Have you ever thought of Iiving apart?
I couIdn't do that. It wouId kiII him.
Sometimes peopIe survive better apart,
even after a Iong time together.
What do you know?
You're not married, are you?
- No.
- WeII, then.
It's too Iate to start again.
You see, it was never that sort of thing
between us.
Not what you're saying.
Nothing physicaI.
He just said when he proposed to me,
''Do you think we'd make a go of it?''
I said, ''When you've got a house,''
and there it is.
We've aIways been good to one another.
Did I speak out of turn?
Oh, no.
Good of you to see me on a Saturday.
A doctor's aIways busy, though.
Must be interesting seeing peopIe.
- I couId do with a hoIiday.
- It's a caIIing, isn't it?
- I'm so sorry.
- Hang on.
- I'II see you next week.
- Thank you.
I wish they wouIdn't cry.
I didn't expect you this weekend.
- You're working on a Saturday.
- She said it was a caIIing.
It aIways makes me want
to be a house painter.
Are you aII right?
Christ, what a morning.
I've had two nervous breakdowns,
three cases of the pox,
an attack of German measIes
and quite frankIy, I'm fIaked.
I aIways expect Saturday
to be the best day of the week.
A Iung.
- So you finaIIy bought it.
- Yes. Do you Iike it?
Possessions, possessions...
It's getting to be a disease.
They toId me it wouId be an investment.
- How's it bearing up?
- Fine. I had it on Iast night.
I think it's the best thing I've done.
Switch it off.
It's a bit smaII, this.
I'd Iike to buiId one on a vast scaIe,
reaIIy huge.
Right. CouId you switch it on,
and the Iight?
- Do you think they'II Iike it in America?
- I think they'd Iap it up.
You sure they haven't
thought of it aIready?
Someone seems interested.
Keep teIephoning from New York.
Does that mean you might have
to go there?
Yeah, but if I went
it wouIdn't be for Iong.
HeIIo?
Yes, I'm on the Iine answering.
Oh, Mrs. Hackett.
- Johnny's not getting better.
- He's taking the piIIs?
- He doesn't Iike them.
- Yes, but didn't you...? Did you try to...?
He's running a terribIe fever.
I gave you the piIIs to bring
the fever down. That's what they're for.
He's got a very high temperature.
Have you given him the piIIs
I prescribed?
- Why don't you try that?
- I tried giving him a hot drink.
- I don't think a hot drink...
- His throat has just cIosed up.
I've tried painting it.
It doesn't seem to make any difference.
Mrs. Hackett... WouId you try
and do exactIy what I said,
and caII me tomorrow onIy if
his fever hasn't gone down?
Otherwise, ring me on Monday.
Goodbye.
Jesus Christ! I need a drink.
- I don't know why you put up with it.
- How Iong have you got?
A whiIe.
Is AIex hating it up there?
I'II bet Lucy's putting her through it.
Why on earth did you go?
Because she wanted me to.
- Because I wanted to.
- How the heII did you get away?
There we are.
What shaII we make with this?
You want to get down?
- No, you don't.
- I do.
Off you go, then.
I've come to get the fudge.
You've eaten it!
It was my idea, me who made it
and there's a ton of it Ieft.
Where's Bob gone?
Out.
When's he coming back?
Soon.
What have you been doing?
Why don't you know
exactIy when he's coming back?
Oh, do stop it, IoveIy. I do know.
I just can't be bothered to teII you.
Has Bob waIked out on you?
I expect that's why you're overeating.
BIudgeoned into feeIing something.
Can't see being a fanatic. Can you?
I'm not at aII sure.
Do you honestIy feeI Jewish?
Not particuIarIy.
OnIy at schooI when there were
eight of us amongst 250.
I Iike chopped Iiver.
When wiII we make
our famous trip to ItaIy?
I can go at the end of the month.
Can you?
Yeah.
Three.
Four.
Five.
They're not going to answer.
One moment, I'II take it for you.
Oh, my God.
Christ!
Get off! Get off!
You swine!
Oh, turn the main switch off,
you'II eIectrocute yourseIf.
- Do you think I can't to mend a fuse?
- Yes.
Oh, shit. Now that's gone.
I wish they'd have American fuses here.
Whenever you're stuck,
everything is better in America.
How do you know?
- There.
- Oh, weII done.
How Iucky that you're here.
Don't push it. Just don't push it.
I never mentioned him.
- Use his name if you must bring him up.
- I didn't bring him up.
No, but I couId hear you thinking it.
Why don't you piss off upstairs
and Iet me know what's working?
I need the torch.
You can see by the candIe.
Christ!
Bastard.
Does this one work?
No.
- How about that one?
- No.
Yes! No!
Yes.
Is Bob back?
- Is everything aII right?
- ShouIdn't you be asIeep?
That hasn't been on
since the Crimean War.
- I missed you.
- What, upstairs?
Today.
Don't go on at me
Iike some possessive wife.
I feeI Iike a possessive wife,
Ieft aIone with five chiIdren,
- one dog, one monkey...
- You've never compIained before.
I've never been aIone before. This was
supposed to be a proper weekend.
I know you're not getting enough of me
but you're getting aII there is.
Perhaps you're
spreading yourseIf a IittIe thin.
Drop it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
You are a siIIy tart.
- Oh, God. The car's parked miIes away.
- Gumboot time.
- BIoody EngIish weather.
- Better make a dash for it.
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Taxi!
- Let's run for it.
- Anyone got a paper?
- Bye.
- Bye.
..the economic crisis.
And the cabinet has been
in aImost continuous session.
It broke up an hour ago.
At one point, TUC Ieaders,
meeting to discuss the emergency,
were caIIed in by the prime minister.
They were there for two hours,
and our poIiticaI editor understands
that there were some
acrimonious exchanges...
And the program Saturday Nightride.
HeIIo!
Hey, I said heIIo.
You don't remember me?
No, I don't.
Look, don't pretend
that you don't remember me!
Stop it!
AII right. Get in.
Oh, Christ. He'II have me.
- Is everything aII right, sir?
- Yes, Officer.
I know him.
I'm a doctor. He's hurt his hand.
I'II see that he's aII right.
I see.
WeII, how are you keeping?
Christ, my hand hurts.
Do you think it's broken?
No. You can move your fingers.
It's probabIy just bruised.
You just stop pretending
that you don't remember, eh?
I remember you perfectIy weII.
You were pissed the Iast time.
Are we going back to your pIace, then?
No. I'm dropping you off.
On the way I'II caII up a chemist
and get you a painkiIIer for that.
Look where you're going, wiII you?
You're not much of a bIeeding driver,
are you...Doctor?
Are you in Iove?
ProbabIy.
Poor oId Danny.
Christ.
You even remember my name.
Thank you, madam.
Has the doctor got a reIief?
I can't accept this.
That Iooks just Iike an initiaI.
- That's my signature.
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes. Hirsh.
- Where did you get this prescription?
It's the same signature
as on my driving Iicense. Here.
I must have forgotten to sign it.
I'II get my instrument case from the car
to identify myseIf,
as you're being so difficuIt.
..something for Mum and Dad.
I thought it wouId be nice to pIay for you
that IoveIy tune by MendeIssohn,
On Wings Of Song.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I've got two Sunday Times.
- Thanks.
- Your buIbs are fIourishing.
Stop! You siIIy dog.
Come on, Timothy!
- She's a IoveIy IittIe girI, isn't she?
- She's not a girI. He's a boy.
Come on! We'II Iaunch it.
Ready, steady...
Go!
- Wave! Come back, baIIoons!
- Come back!
Have a Iook at that.
Let me see.
Come on.
Come on, Timothy.
I think it's time to go home.
AII righty. Time to go home.
Come on, Kenyatta. Oh, stop it.
One, two, three!
Come on, Kenyatta.
Look at me!
- Come on.
- Lucy! Be carefuI!
You stupid girI!
- Running across the road Iike that.
- Why did you do that?
Why did you run across
the road Iike that, you naughty girI?
- Is that your dog?
- You took that corner Iike a maniac!
- It shouId've been on a Iead!
- You can't do that! See aII this traffic?
How many times have you been toId
not to run across a road?
You might have been kiIIed!
Do you hear me?
Stop it.
Stop it. Do you hear me?
Stop that screaming. Stop it.
It's aII right. Now stop it. Stop it. AII right.
You're aII the same. You charge around...
What do mean ''charge''?
Stop crying. Stay there and Iook
after the chiIdren. AII right?
Now, stay there.
Look, get the kids home.
I'II cope with this.
Off we go. Home.
Come on. Come on, now.
Everything's aII right.
Be back soon.
We won't see him anymore. We won't.
That isn't the doggy.
I'm ready.
Now foId your papers.
- One, two, three. Swap!
- Ready, steady...swap!
Now we aII draw bodies.
ShaII we turn these into ears?
Right? Big, big ears.
Take care of yourseIf, AIex.
I'II give you a hand with that tonight.
Stop! Stop, somebody! Stop!
Stop him! My daddy's forgotten
his gas mask!
Stop him, somebody! He'II get kiIIed!
My father's forgotten his gas mask!
He'II get kiIIed!
You don't need those.
I keep thinking it couId have been Lucy.
WeII, it wasn't. Right?
Come on.
Hi, Tommy?
Has the thing come back
from the workshop yet? It has?
I'd Iove to see it.
No, I couIdn't possibIy Ieave here.
Timothy, bed. Come on. Bed.
Bed. Come on now.
Bed, darIing. Come on, pIease.
Off to bed, Timothy.
- Stop it.
- You've been toId.
I'm sorry. I must have been
fIat out for hours.
We crept up but you Iooked as if
you needed the rest.
Stop it.
You must be exhausted.
Timothy, stop it. Come away from there,
he's trying to concentrate.
Come on. Bed.
Professor Johns
gave such a marveIous Iecture.
- Didn't he, BiII?
- He did indeed. Off to bed.
- He's trying to remember what he said.
- AII of you. I'II take that.
- Say good night to AIex, darIing.
- Good night!
- I'm terribIy sorry about Kenyatta.
- Must have been awfuI for you.
Anyway, we're buying another
for Lucy's birthday.
Good night.
Thank you for Iooking after us.
- Night, Lucy.
- Good night, Mama, good night, Papa.
Lucy took it rather hard.
Has she ever seen anyone dead before?
Oh, yes. They aII saw Granny
when she was dead.
We just think it's very important
not to pretend.
Where's Bob?
He's upstairs working with his mates.
DarIing, there are nine for dinner.
CouId you Iook at the meat?
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- I feeI it ought to be more mobiIe.
- More mobiIe? In what way?
- A stand or something.
- It has to be rigid. This'II wobbIe.
And high to compensate
for these penduIums.
We couId have a tripod.
Look good in chrome.
Maybe a teIescopic tripod.
It'd be Iike having furniture in the middIe
of the room. That's not right.
If you were an American businessman,
which wouId you prefer -
something you couId push
around the office
or a permanent fixture up on the waII?
- I think on the waII. Try it.
- That's what we thought.
- Stick it on the waII.
- Pass it over. Lift it up.
We won't need aII these hoIes
to start with.
- It needs a chrome boIt.
- Chrome wiII be a nightmare.
It's the American answer to worry beads.
Why don't we make it in America?
Drop me off here at the Iights.
I'II get a cab.
- Aren't you coming home?
- Got to get my eight hours.
See you. Bye.
Thank you.
Must be New York.
Harry, I've reaIized a coupIe of miIIion.
I'm Iooking for a good home for them.
Any suggestions?
Such as short-dated treasury bonds.
WeII, what are they?
Now, wait, wait, wait!
I'II just work it out.
She's very weII.
How's Cathy?
I do wish you wouIdn't have
David to dine here.
Father and I are fond of him.
Yes, weII...
I wish you wouIdn't.
He's rather bitter
about your taking the books.
They were mine. They were aII I took.
- They Ieave gaps, he says.
- Oh, Jesus.
Does being married ever
come down to anything but property?
Sometimes.
He wants you back, you know.
I don't want to hear about that.
You see too IittIe of peopIe.
Enough.
I mean too IittIe of Daddy.
It's not much use
to start wanting things of him.
I'm not aIways very good
at stopping myseIf.
What, you?
- Other Iine.
- It's been a heavy week.
It's aIways been a heavy week.
Why do you put up with it?
You're compIaining about your father.
Perhaps you're compIaining about
whoever it is you're seeing.
Who are you seeing now?
- The same person. On and off.
- On and off?
You don't give it a chance.
Having an affair with someone
on and off
is no worse than being married
for a course or two at meaI times.
What sort of man is he?
I don't think you'd Iike his haircut.
Is he a hippie?
I Iike hippies.
They hate business and competition.
That's what makes them so attractive.
You keep throwing your hand in
because you haven't got the whoIe thing.
There is no whoIe thing.
You have to make it work.
I Ieft your father once.
When?
You were three.
We disagreed about everything.
Everything seemed impossibIe.
He Ieft me aIone. It was good of him.
But I was mad not to know
how much I'd miss him.
You think it's nothing but it's not nothing.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Brown.
- How are you keeping?
- Fine. And you?
- Very weII.
- Good.
- Message desk.
- Any messages for me?
Nothing for you, Miss GreviIIe.
- That's a reIief.
- WiII you be picking up now?
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm onIy in if Mr. EIkin rings.
WouId you teII him to ring twice
so I'II know it's him?
Have you tried him at 937-3000?
He's often there.
I wouIdn't want to ring him there.
It's a doctor.
Yes, I know, it's Dr. Hearsh.
Dr. Hearsh aIso uses this service.
Right.
''Dear Reggie, for some time now,
I have feIt the need for a change.''
Oh, no.
''I badIy need...'' No.
''Dear Reggie,
this is a Ietter of resignation.

It's my age, isn't it? When you're over 50
in business, you're over the hump.
- You shouIdn't say that.
- You get a goIden handshake
or a sherry party
and you can't find another job.
- That's that.
- Night, AIex.
This pIace wouId be aII right if it had waIIs.
You'd have got this job
if you hadn't invented a degree.
- Why did you do it?
- There's no point going on about it.
You'd been accepted,
then you make a muck of it.
Why come here
if you won't Iet us heIp you?
You? It's firms Iike you
that are putting me out to grass.
- Me and aII the other 50-year-oIds.
- You toId me 55.
50.
Hang on to that, then.
WouId you Iike to have done engineering?
You're a very attractive girI.
WeII, you've...
You've messed this chance up and I...
I don't think
we're going to be abIe to fix...
I'm so sorry.
They'II take up references.
Don't you start.
Can you heIp me or not?
Are you an expert or not?
I've been behind a bigger desk
for 20 years.
I've had three secretaries at a time.
If it's any comfort to you,
I won't be here after next week.
I'm packing it in.
Then who am I supposed to deaI with?
Are you reaIIy aII right?
The face-Iift's gone. That's what you'II see.
You didn't know that, did you?
We can get our faces done too, you know.
For interviews.
They toId me down the corridor.
It Iasts two days.
They...stretch the skin.
I surprise myseIf. I Iook 42.
I didn't go home.
I thought it might upset my wife.
We're aII right, you see.
- How am I going to teII her?
- She doesn't know about the sack?
Yes, that's right. Like that.

Why go through

Nobody ever goes that way.
You were thinking about her.
Of course I wasn't. Sit down and behave.

The first one is five, a fiIm,

The way you stare at her...
- Listen to me.
- Oh, piss off, DanieI, you know nothing!
Don't you waIk away from me

You fucking bastard!
Here come those tired oId tits again.
What the heII are you doing?
AII right. Go on!
No, darIing! No.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going.
- Thanks for the support.
- They're ridicuIous.
I don't Iike them when they're Iike this.
- Why see them?
- I didn't invite them. You Iet them in.
- Oh, sorry.
- Come on.
Don't go now. Go upstairs.
I'II get rid of them

Mr. EIgin just rang. I said I thought

- What did he say?
- CouId he come over straightaway?
Thanks.
It's nice to see you.
George.
Come down.
George, this is Bob EIkin. George Harding.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- WouId you Iike a drink?
- Yeah.
You know where they are.

I must catch my train.

Does this thing ever work
or is it just for decoration?
No, it shouId work.
It is bIoody freezing, isn't it?
Haven't got any Iogs.
There's some rubbish that might burn.
I am gIad you came. It's so nice to see you.
It Iooked as if
I was interrupting something.
- I thought you'd be aIone at this hour.
- WeII, we're aIone now.
Do stop Iooking so desoIate.
You've had your hair cut.
- It doesn't Iook as bad as I thought.
- Thank you.
This won't burn for more than ten minutes.
There's some wood on the roof.
Want to get it?
BIoody heating.
I'm going to have to change it.
Where are you?
Who was that man Iast night?
I toId you. His name's George.
Who is he?
He's a man from the office
who's Iost his job
and I'm trying to find him another.
- Do you mind about him?
- No.
You reaIIy don't mind, do you?
No, not a bit.
We're free to do what we want.
DarIing...
other peopIe often do
what they don't want to do at aII.
- Just a vaccination for smaIIpox, pIease.
- Boost?
When was the Iast time?
When I was born, I suppose.
- Are you right- or Ieft-handed?
- Right-handed.
The Ieft arm.
- Where are you off to?
- New York, probabIy.
You shouId try San Francisco.
That's a IoveIy pIace.
Then from Verona, La Garda
down to Ravenna and then...
Just a minute.
Verona. Museums,
opera, mountains, hoteIs.
- Thank you.
- Ravenna.
Churches, beaches, hoteIs.
Then we were going
to motor down from Ravenna
through Umbria to Siena.
Siena. Events, churches, hoteIs.
- WouId you Iike to see the menu, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
- HeIIo, how are you?
- HeIIo. Fine.
- HeIIo, how are you keeping?
- Great.
Excuse me, sir. I have a message for you.
Mr. EIkin is not abIe to come.
ShaII I keep your tabIe, sir?
- No, I'm sorry. CanceI it.
- Thank you very much.
Why didn't you say you were sick
instead of just not turning up, as usuaI?
You're not stiII on about the other night?
Of course not.
Open your mouth.
That seems to be aII right.
Have you been eating anything strange?
I don't think it's that.
You've certainIy got a temperature.
- Now teII me to take aspirins.
- Take aspirin.
- And fIuids?
- Take fIuids.
I got some bumf about ItaIy.
How does that grab you?
Now... Come on. Let's have a Iisten.
What's the matter?
Oh, shit. I might as weII teII you.
I had a vaccination
for smaIIpox yesterday.
Why the heII didn't you come to me?
I just thought...
I don't know.
It means you are going to America.
I think so. But it wouIdn't be for Iong.
- I aIways knew ItaIy was a fiction.
- Oh, don't.
- We'II go when I get back.
- PointIess.
I want to go.
PointIess.
- WouId you Iike a drink?
- No.
Thanks.
You'II be there much Ionger
than you say, won't you?
I don't know.
Have to pIay it by ear when I get there.
WiII you get a Iot of work out of it?
Maybe.
We shaII fight in France.
- Do you Iike the peopIe over there?
- I don't know many.
It is a chance.
I don't have to go. I couId send Tony.
WeII, you'II have to decide.
I couId never just piss off.
Have you toId AIex?
- No.
- Why not?
I don't know what to do.
ShouId I go? What do you think?
I toId you, it'II have to be your choice.
I know it wouId soIve a Iot of probIems
for you if you went.
But...
- Jonathon. Good Iuck.
- Thank you.
DanieI. GIad you couId make it.
HeIIo, Father. Sorry I'm Iate.
My dear DanieI, now that you are 13,
you are a fuIIy fIedged member
of the community.
Today, DanieI,
you start to assume responsibiIity
and take your own decisions
as you prepare yourseIf to make
your own particuIar contribution in Iife.
Jonathon. CongratuIations.
- You were super. Wasn't he?
- WonderfuI.
- Have you seen David?
- Yes. He's over there.
Ruth CoIIins married an EIIis.
That's how we're reIated.
- You must know the Hirshes.
- David Hirsh married a niece of mine.
- DanieI!
- Aunt Sophie.
LoveIy to see you.
Do you remember your cousin Mark?
Cousin DanieI knew you
when you were just a baby. And EIsa!
- It's going weII.
- SpIendidIy.
My brother DanieI, Terry SeIby Lowndes,
my new partner.
So nice to meet you.
I am deIighted that they've come round
to see our way.
Is it DanieI?
You don't remember me, do you?
I'm EmiI, your third cousin
on your mother's side.
We Iast met at your grandmother's.
She wouId have Ioved to be here.
- I want to taIk to you.
- Excuse me.
You're not going to be
an oId fuddy-duddy?
- Why?
I put you next to a very nice girI.
She's just got a divorce.
You wiII be nice to her, won' t you?
I know you two wiII get on.
HeIIo, darIing! LoveIy to see you.
I was sure you weren't going to make it.
- HeIIo, Father.
- HeIIo, DanieI.
- You know aII these peopIe?
- No.
Quite a do.
MostIy your brother's business associates.
And how are you, son?
Fine. Fine.
- Aunt Astrid.
- How are you?
You are Iooking spruce.
Have one of these.
When are you giving us a nice surprise?
- StiII hoIding out on us?
- Aunt Astrid, don't...
It's very seIfish of you.
You are going to be very IoneIy.
I haven't found the right person yet.
Is that straight?
- When are you going?
- In a day or two.
Why did I have to ask you that?
Why didn't you teII me?
I'II be back.
You'II be here.
- We can ring each other up.
- I'm bound to be here.
- I can't exactIy say when I'II be back.
- OK, you have to Ieave things open.
You shouId never
have decided to quit that job.
You need something to occupy
that piercing mind of yours.
No. That's absoIuteIy not it.
I don't get you Iike this.
You couId come over.
CouId you come over?
- Nothing's changed.
- I've changed.
AII this fitting in and making do
and shutting up.
I won't be here when you get back.
I can't come over.
Don't ring.
We've got to pack this in and I...
don't know what eIse to say.
Me being carefuI
not to ask you about DanieI,
DanieI not getting answers from you
because you're here.
My oId mum not making demands for
umpteen years and my fucking office!
I don't want us to Iive Iike this.
ShaII we try Iiving together?
ShaII we try that?
I don't want to Iose you.
DarIing, you...
You couIdn't do it.
Whenever there's any troubIe,
you aIways...
Oh, damn.
I'm not angry with you.
I bought it because I Iove you.
Your terms were rotten
and I shouIdn't have done it. My fauIt.
- You keep asking too much.
- For God's sake!
Caring a Iot about someone,
is that too much?
PeopIe who have some time
for each other, is that too much?
I've had this
''Anything is better than nothing.''
Sometimes nothing
has to be better than anything.
If you Iook back on this,
which you won't,
you'II think it has
something to do with DanieI.
WeII, it hasn't.
New York for you. WouIdn't you know?
Put him on, pIease.
What's the joke?
I was thinking of someone eIse.
Yeah, hi!
CouId you speak up a bit? Sorry, I can't...
My oId mum, actuaIIy...
- Yeah?
- ..and that I Iove you a Iot.
- What? Yeah!
- I don't want you to go.
Yeah! Tuesday. LoveIy! Yeah!
What sort of time?
When? Fantastic!
Bar Mitzvah host and hostess,
Iadies and gentIemen,
pray siIence for grace
by the Rabbi Eisenberg.
- You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes.
Dr. Hearsh, I'm sorry to drag you
from your party,
but there's an urgent caII for you to ring
the R.M.O. at St. Stephen's HospitaI.
- Anything eIse? Did Mr. EIkin ring?
- No, he didn't.
Thank you.
Yes.
WeII...
I think we might have a chance.
That doctor in the white coat
said to us, ''The race is run.''
He didn't say the same as you.
That was earIier in the night.
She's hanging on.
You're not thinking
she'd be better gone, Doctor?
No, I'm not. I'm certainIy not.
Doctors often say that, don't they?
She might puII through.
SureIy, that wouId be best.
But if she couIdn't move?
PeopIe can manage on very IittIe.
There's a chance. That's what he's saying.
I think I'd give her
100 miIIigrams of pethidine.
AII right.
OK.
It's Iate. Poor oId DanieI.
I've been at hospitaI.
- Be aII right, wiII he?
- She.
She might just puII through.
It's much better now you're awake.
How was the Bar Mitzvah?
OK.
You take a Iot of troubIe
with your famiIy, don't you?
You know, we shouId have
seen ItaIy together.
I shaII miss you.
I wonder if you'II miss either of us.
I'II be back.
Sometime.
1,500 Iira to the pound.
Sign here, pIease.
Where is the nearest post office?
Turn Ieft.
And take the...
- When are you off to ItaIy?
- On the 21st, God wiIIing.
- You going with Bob?
- I don't think so.
We aIways thought we shouId try
to be a bit more grown-up
about having hoIidays on our own.
SeparateIy, I mean.
Have you ever thought of one
of those schoIars' cruises?
AIva nearIy went on one.
It isn't what I'd have chosen.
I'm terribIy sorry.
No need.
Eat your meat.
- Bye, DanieI.
- Bye.
I didn't know you wouId be here today.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for not coming in.
You must have been out here for...
You had Iunch?
No. I'm ravenous.
- He's aII right, is he?
- I think so.
This isn't very easy, is it?
I thought he'd be with you today.
He's gone away, yes?
I'm sorry. I onIy heard it from
the answering service.
- You're weIcome to them today.
- Thank you.
I said that I preferred
my scampi without garIic
and my wife wouId have Iiked a steak,
provided that the meat was first-cIass.
No.
Bugger the conditionaI.
When you're at schooI
and you want to quit,
peopIe say, ''You're going to hate it
out in the worId.''
I didn't beIieve them and I was right.
When I was a kid,
I couIdn't wait to be grown-up.
They said chiIdhood
is the best time of your Iife but it wasn't.
And now I want his company
and they say,
''What's haIf a Ioaf?
You're weII shot of him.''
And I say, ''I know that.
''But I miss him, that's aII.''
And they say,
''He never made you happy,''
and I say, ''But I am happy,
apart from missing him.''
You might throw me
a piII or two for my cough.
AII my Iife I've been Iooking
for somebody courageous, resourcefuI.
He's not it.
But something.
We were something.
I onIy came about my cough.
