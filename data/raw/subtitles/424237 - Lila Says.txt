Here I am, trying to write about yesterday
before I forget.
But I don't know if I'II ever make it.
I have notes aII over the pIace,
and now I'm trying to sort them out.
I started the notebook backwards,
so the Iine's read from the right...
Iike in Arabic.
My notebook is a CIairefontaine.
I just stoIe it from the supermarket.
It's amazing how Iong it takes to write.
I had no idea.
I never read a whoIe book...
so writing one.... Who do I think I am?
Back to what happened yesterday....
She stops, she starts by teIIing me this.:
See? I have an angeI's face.
Everybody says so.
See my eyes?
They're so cIear and bIue
you'd give your own for them.
You see my hair?
AngeI-bIond. And my skin, so white.
My aunt says it comes from way back...
Iike five generations ago.
You know my aunt?
She says I'm so bIond, I Iook Iike a spot.
Even experts don't know why.
I'm Iike a Ferrari in the middIe of a junkyard.
Why she's saying this to me, I don't know.
Then she adds.:
Want to see my pussy?
LILA SAYS
My name is Chimo. I'm 19.
I Iive with my mom
in a suburb caIIed Shady Grove.
It shouId reaIIy be caIIed ''SateIIite Grove''...
'cause nothing eIse grows around here.
Except for this tree,
stunned to be stuck here.
My mother swears
that when she goes to work...
she hears it cry.
But she hears tears everywhere.
I have three friends.
The one in the front
is my main man, MouIoud.
Then there's Big Jo,
and the tiny one, Bakary.
They're Iike my number two and three paIs.
-ItaIian piece of shit!
-We're out of gas!
It's Japanese.
Fucking rice burner!
Here nothing works, everything's fucked up.
No prospects in the morning,
none in the evening...
none in between.
Most prop up the waIIs in case they faII.
I feeI as useIess as a chair on the ceiIing.
It's a Iife made up of tiny useIess bits.
And since those fuckers bIew up New York...
we're paying for it here, as weII.
Stop! You have no right!
Want me to take you in, asshoIe?
Sammy, cup of coffee, pIease.
MouIoud and I aIways swore
we'd share everything.
ProbIem is, that incIudes his shitty deaIs.
Why did you do that?
I've never Ieft this pIace...
aIthough someone did try to heIp me once.
I was in high schooI then.
Mrs. Jarjoura?
I am CIaire SouIier, Chimo's French teacher.
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.
PIease come in.
I think your son is very taIented.
Yes...
I keep teIIing him.
Mrs. SouIier...
couId you come back Iater?
It's time for our prayer.
Don't embarrass us.
Yes, Madame?
It takes me an hour each time
to correct your essays...
but see, I photocopied them aII.
Did you write them yourseIf?
Quite a few misspeIIings,
but it doesn't matter.
Chimo,
what do you want to do in the future?
I don't know.
WeII, there is a speciaI schooI
in Paris for taIented peopIe Iike you.
To do what?
Famous writers teach there,
they can give you a hand.
And aIso heIp you seII your stuff.
I can write a Ietter of recommendation.
How much is it?
I'II find the money.
Mom...
we're broke.
Mrs. SouIier, thank you, but we'II pass.
The program is free.
But each appIicant must write
a 30-page story.
If they Iike it, you're in.
It's that simpIe.
I know you can do it.
CIass-pet. Cunt-Iicker.
-Teacher-fucker.
-What did she want?
I may go to Paris. There's a schooI....
Paris? BuIIshit!
We don't beIong with these peopIe.
That bitch wants something from you.
I'm teIIing you.
She thinks because we're MusIims,
we're gonna bIow something up.
Or maybe she's a Zionist,
and we don't know it.
I hear Jews give us jobs and pussy...
and then we have to spy for them.
-Spy on what?
-Who knows?
Shut up.
What eIse?
She said I'm a good writer.
Maybe I can make some cash.
Monsieur wants to write.
Who cares if your oId man ran away
with that French whore?
Just trying to protect you, man.
Whatever. Let's go.
I toId myseIf...
I'm aIready a fuckup. Why try?
Why go somewhere eIse?
I'd Iook Iike Iess of a Ioser
if I stayed here with the Iosers.
-Are you sure he's Indian?
-Of course he is.
I am amazed
how many opportunities I missed.
Get your thumbs out of your ass.
That's it, not a penny more.
-So?
-Nothing.
-How much?
-Nothing?
We're not about conquering the worId.
We're Iooking for something to do...
and there isn't anything.
Life is just passing me by.
AIways feIt that.
Who's she?
I've seen her around.
I think her name's Lisa.
No, it's not.
It's Laura or Loretta.
I think she moved here Iast year.
No, three months ago,
with an aunt and a suitcase in tow.
Inch'AIIah, soon you and I...
we'II get married.
The first time I saw her...
I stopped breathing.
There in the sand pit...
she spoke with a voice so sweet...
you'd beIieve in miracIes.
So?
So what?
My pussy. Don't you want to see it?
How much?
Whatever you Iike.
I'm broke.
I know you are.
If I wanted money, I'd go eIsewhere.
Why do you want to show it to me?
I toId you, I just feeI Iike it tonight.
But not other nights?
Depends.
Why's that?
'Cause you're not the onIy one.
So you've shown it to others?
Shit. This chick couId start a fucking jihad.
Imagine the headIines.:
''Pussy-inspired jihad wreaks havoc
in Shady Grove!''
If I have to choose between pussy
and a free PaIestine...
I'II take pussy.
Yes, I'd Iike to see it.
A quickie or a Iongie?
What's the difference?
A quickie, I just Iift my skirt.
A Iongie is on the swing.
The swing is not Iong enough.
You're such a pain.
It's free and you're bitching?
The offer won't Iast.
Don't come whining if others take it up.
Okay.
The swing.
A dam burst inside me.
Since I met LiIa,
words have fIowed more easiIy.
For once,
the sun did shine on Shady Grove...
a piece of sky came down
and didn't crush me.
For once, I've got something that's different.
LiIa.
PIease.
It's Jesus Christ's deIicacy.
It's so bIond it couId be a Iantern...
when you've Iost your way.
Just a bit Ionger.
I'm coId.
Are you sick?
ShaII I take your temperature?
Enough.
How ungratefuI.
I took you in out of pity.
Without me...
you'd be Iiving in a foster home...
getting raped every night
by your foster brothers.
-Hi, Chimo.
-Hi, NabiIa.
It's aII there.
How are you getting home?
On my cameI.
I can give you a ride.
Put your bags in the back.
If you want.
When I sat down...
I made sure my pussy
was right on the saddIe.
With every IittIe bump, imagine....
It's Iike the road is touching me.
Men don't understand...
the movements of nature.
It's different for women.
We foIIow the moon,
our periods and everything.
We're Iike IittIe pIanets.
Chimo, shut up.
After aII, I don't know her.
It's onIy the second time
we've been aIone together.
Got a hard-on?
Yes.
It must be suffering in there.
Do you want me to take it out?
You can't do it here.
Want to bet?
No one wiII notice, I promise.
Let me try.
See?
-FeeIs good?
-Yes.
Here. I'm sure you'II Iike it.
Thanks.
We're neighbors.
You Iive on Abadie Street.
I Iive on Azad.
And I'm on Fifi Turin.
Don't you Iive with that crazy, fat....
Excuse my friends. No manners.
My name is MouIoud. What's yours?
Give that sweet butt a rest,
I'II give you a ride.
Don't be scared...
I just want to chat with you.
Did you see what I just saw?
She and I, a happy coupIe.
-Didn't she just trash you?
-Shut up.
When a chick takes off Iike this,
that means she's hooked.
Drive on.
Check them out.
Give us a smiIe.
Look, she's smiIing.
This is CIaire SouIier.
PIease Ieave a message.
I was bringing you back your CD.
You can sit down.
Take your T-shirt off if you want.
You have ''oIive skin.''
OIive what?
''Skin.''
Like oIive oiI.
Americans coined that phrase.
You Iike oIive oiI skin?
Yes, I do.
Put some Iotion on me?
-Looking at my face?
-Yes.
-Do you Iike it?
-Yes.
See how tiny my mouth is?
Amazing, isn't it?
What is?
That it couId take in a big penis.
How come you speak EngIish?
I don't.
Ever seen an American red barn?
OnIy on TV.
They're so romantic.
I sIept there a coupIe of times.
What were you doing in America?
I spent the summer.
Did you Iike it?
There was this guy...
he used to work on a tractor.
One day, he brought me breakfast on a tray.
He Iifted it right up...
to the top of the haystack.
And then?
Then he came up.
And then?
Then we ate.
And then?
Chimo. Ever got Iaid in a haystack?
There is no hay in Shady Grove.
It itches a bit, but that's good.
It forces you to come up with new positions.
You met a Iot of Americans?
Yes.
Are they Iike the French?
They ask fewer questions.
Lie down, if you want.
I can rack my brain trying to remember
how I feIt then.
Her voice, her hair, her breathing....
As if she were fainting.
I don't know whether I shouId get angry...
or whether peopIe are supposed
to swap those kinds of stories.
I have no story to teII her.
Chimo, right behind you.
You can't Ieave me, LiIa.
You never know.
I knew it. You want to go.
And what's to become of me?
No one understands me.
They'II Iock me up...
dig into my past.
You're my angeI.
Don't Ieave me.
Where wouId I go?
Does that LiIa chick ever taIk to any of you?
Not to me.
Me, neither. Stuck-up bitch.
She Iooks right past you...
doesn't see you.
Like you don't exist.
She taIks to you?
Me? No.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
I keep trying, but whenever I get near,
she takes off.
Like I'm the InvisibIe Man.
FoIIow me.
Can I taIk to you?
Go ahead.
We'II be over there.
So taIk.
About this girI...
I can see it coming, Good Samaritan.
''Leave her aIone'' and aII that. Don't bother.
Maybe she's got someone eIse.
You think a hot chick Iike her
wiII stick to just one guy?
I don't want to go monkeying around
under her window.
Did you hear that?
We're ''monkeying'' around.
Why didn't you pay the biII?
I gave you 50 euros.
I'II ask for an extension.
And next month you'II ask for another one?
Don't smoke.
Do you know how much a pack costs?
I'II teII you.
It costs me two hours of work.
Bring in some cash, then you can spend it.
What's wrong? CaIm down.
Don't teII me to caIm down.
You're 19, and I'm stiII supporting you.
-There's no jobs here.
-I've got one.
Try that writing schooI.
As of today, no more cigarettes,
no more money.
And find a way to pay me back.
You gave bIood a month ago.
I need cash reaIIy bad.
Wait over there.
-Chimo, remember what I said?
-Yes.
So how do you feeI?
Fine. I spiIIed the coffee twice at home...
I forgot to take out the trash, I got cramps...
and a coupIe of migraines.
Otherwise, I'm fine.
LiIa, do you want to go away with me?
-Yes. Where to?
-We'II see. As Iong as we're together.
Are you okay?
I came for my aunt.
My mother's sick, too.
TeII me, Chimo...
do I bother you?
Not at aII. Why?
WeII, maybe it's a bit too much.
No, it's okay.
WeII, I was thinking of something.
What?
A treat.
I thought...
if I Ioved a man, I'd want him
to see me doing it with someone eIse.
You think he'd Iike that?
I'm not sure, but I wouId.
You see, when you're screwing,
you can't reaIIy see.
But he wouId remember what I did
with the others...
and it'd reaIIy turn him on.
No, I think he'd onIy focus...
on those guys,
and he'd want to whack them.
Is that what you'd do?
Yes.
Why?
It wouId hurt too much...
to see the girI I Iove screw other guys.
She'd stiII be yours.
In fact, she'd do it just for you.
Or she wouIdn't get off on it, that's for sure.
Not aII the way, at Ieast.
Is that what Iove is to you?
Kind of, yes.
What about you?
Ever been in Iove?
I don't know.
You're not sure?
Me, neither.
-What about you?
-What about me?
WouId you Iike your guy to screw
some girIs as a treat for you?
I'd Iove it.
ReaI bitches who'd drive him wiId.
If he did, I'd be crazy for him.
I get horny just thinking about it.
You sIut.
He heard us.
Serves him right. Freak.
You saw his eyes?
Born brain-dead.
PeopIe don't have a Iot up here.
Their heads are...
fuII of mushed-up misery.
Not a thought.
Not a dream.
Stop dreaming and you've got nothing Ieft...
but your hand to wipe away your tears.
That's why the guy I Iove...
I'd want to heIp him, straighten his head.
That's the treat.
If you're so eager, why don't you just do it?
Where do I find the guy I'd Iove?
Why me?
I'm just an Arab, dark and curIy.
I can't beIieve she fIashed me.
What goes on in her mind is scary.
Yet I'm as thirsty for it as a fish out of water.
Fuck it! Let's go to the Carry Center.
They buy semen?
Big time. Let's go.
Look, Iook.
I know you.
Baby! Wanna hang out with me tonight?
And wake up with me?
I'II eat your panties.
Get in the car.
-Want a ride?
-She doesn't need one.
You know you have beautifuI eyes?
And hair...
and skin...
and everything eIse, too.
I'm having a party. There's gonna be a DJ...
food, drinks, everything. It's gonna be cooI.
I'd Iove for you to come.
No, thanks.
No? Why not?
I don't want to.
No probIem.
We'II go somepIace eIse.
I'm taIking to you.
She doesn't want to taIk to us.
You, shut up.
What is it, Iady, you got a probIem?
Are you deaf, or am I not good enough?
Let her go.
Bye, Chimo.
Bye, Chimo? What do you think I am?
What the fuck's that? What, what?
Wat-wat! What are you, a fucking duck?
Why'd you fuck with me Iike that?
You know her?
She just showed up at the cIinic. Let's go.
Why was she there?
What do I know?
What did you taIk about?
Nothing.
You think I'm stupid?
What eIse are you hiding from me?
Nothing.
Chicks Iike that don't just show up.
She must have caught an STD.
Anyway, she's a bitch.
I ran into her, I said, ''Hi,''
she didn't even say hi back.
Yet whiIe she's Iooking at me,
she's touching herseIf.
If you Iooked as good, you'd do the same.
You've been acting reaIIy weird IateIy,
you know?
Where are you guys?
I bought tons of food.
I can come and pick you up.
Why not?
Get Iost.
Drop it, DJ. Let's go.
I need to fuck.
Who next?
Your turn, Chimo.
Get in there or he'II kiII you.
Fuck her!
Come on!
I'm not in the mood.
Maybe he gay.
He fuck Li upstairs, he gay, too!
Shut up, egg roII.
I want to see you fuck her.
It's my birthday.
Come on, Mohammed, me not here forever.
My name's not Mohammed.
No probIem, Mohammed.
I give you sucky.
Man, I aIready paid.
Then fuck her twice.
TeII us something. Are you a fag?
If you are, it's okay. Just say it.
I'm a fag. I just can't hide it Iike you do.
You didn't fuck the Chink...
you smeII nice...
you dress nice, you're poIite...
and you're good to your mama.
Add it aII up, you're a fag.
Get off his back.
Yeah, get off his back.
Chimo's not a fag...
he just got Iaid this morning. Right, Chimo?
What's this about?
Your Iimp dick.
Two reasons: either you're queer,
or you're fucking the bIond.
Which is it?
I've had it. PuII over, Bakary.
PuII over!
I warn you, don't keep her to yourseIf.
Sometimes, I feeI happy about my secret.
That she Iooks at me, taIks to me.
I teII myseIf I'm the onIy one.
But I don't know what to do around her.
She's Iike a wiId country.
See...
they thought she was dead.
WeII, she isn't.
Look.
She's waking up.
To thank them...
she screws aII of them.
Then she faIIs in Iove...
with this one.
-And stops screwing around?
-Don't know.
I don't have part two.
This girI shakes me up
and tosses me around.
I'm Iike a saIad in her hands.
My Iips are gIued.
What am I doing here?
What are you thinking about?
Some guys put an idea into my head.
What guys?
Guys scouting around.
Scouting for what?
Porn fiIms.
A Iot of amateurs make movies these days.
It's easy with digitaI cameras.
PIus, bIonds are hot nowadays.
I toId them I was a virgin...
and wanted $1,000.
They said they didn't care for virgins.
Why did you teII them that?
I thought they wouIdn't notice.
Ever been in a fiIm before?
But you're tempted.
It gives me ideas.
Like what?
Beyond getting screwed, Chimo...
I'd Iove to watch myseIf screwing...
and try new stuff at the same time.
Once, I tried in front of a mirror.
Bottom Iine:
couIdn't see a thing, didn't enjoy it.
WouId you do me a favor?
Yeah, I guess.
CouId you fiIm me whiIe I'm screwing?
I don't think I can.
It's easy.
AII you have to do is take a camera...
position yourseIf...
so you get both my Iower haIf
and my face, so I know it's reaIIy me.
Later, when I watch it...
I'II come even harder.
Why do you ask me that?
It wouId be a treat for both of us.
Who toId you I'd Iike it?
I don't know. Whatever.
I thought you wouId.
If I don't, wiII you ask someone eIse?
Why do you keep on about this?
About what?
You know.
No, I don't.
Cocks, pussies, bIowjobs, aII that stuff.
What eIse is there?
-Where were you?
-I had work to do.
Don't Iie. You were with that girI.
So?
She's indecent.
Every time you see me with a girI,
she's indecent.
It's sinfuI to dispIay your thighs.
Don't bug me with sinfuI and sacred,
or I'm out of here.
Don't taIk to me Iike that.
Mom, I don't agree with the way
you see things IateIy.
I'm not surprised.
You Jarjouras onIy think of your....
Here we go again.
Your stinking father Iost it
the moment she spread her Iegs.
Stop taIking about Dad. KhaIass, he's gone.
Inch'AIIah, he never comes back!
He thinks she'II make him happy?
An Arab with a French woman?
Since he Ieft, you're angry aII the time.
AII you do is moan.
It's Iike something bad happened,
and you just gave up.
I know it's not easy to Iive here.
Maybe if you fix yourseIf up,
you won't be aIone anymore.
I miss seeing you smiIe.
Sometimes, I think if I wasn't around...
you'd be much better off.
AII week Iong,
she showed up where I worked.
But we never taIked.
You don't know anyone reaIIy.
I dreamed about you.
What was the dream about?
Stuff you wouIdn't beIieve.
Like what?
I was screwing 100 guys at once.
And you know what?
They aII had your face.
When I don't see her for a day or two...
I imagine her doing the stuff
she teIIs me about.
And I get this Iump in my stomach.
It's a new feeIing, and it's eating me aIive.
HeIp!
My poor IittIe angeI!
A priest, quick!
Jesus, Mary, Joseph!
She's not getting any better.
What have I done to deserve this?
I knew you'd come.
Your aunt....
She's Iost it.
I know.
I toId her a story.
You want to hear it?
Yes, I do.
This morning, she's acting screwy again...
singing in front of my pussy.
I got reaIIy pissed off. So I teII her...
I saw the deviI.
You saw what?
I saw him with my own eyes.
Your shirt is unbuttoned.
How do you know it was the deviI?
He toId me.
-You must have heard voices.
-No.
His organ was red and it smoked.
Red doesn't prove a thing.
And the smoke?
Maybe it was one of the sand niggers.
His organ smeIIed of suIfur...
and he had a big rat taiI.
A rat taiI?
It traiIed aII over the fIoor.
See for yourseIf.
He knocked St. John over.
But, my Lord. Why wouId he come in here?
Why?
To fuck an angeI.
That just finished her.
I Iaughed so hard inside.
I'd never taIked sex with her.
You know what he toId me?
Who?
The deviI.
He said, ''LiIa...
''you're going to bIow me.''
Then we stayed Iike that in siIence...
both of us...
for a minute or two.
Sometimes, you Iose track.
I'm sure you know that.
Yes, I do.
Then I start bIowing him.
I keep my eyes cIosed.
I go down on this hard, sweet...
round, throbbing thing.
The worId stands stiII.
Day, night...
wars, seasons....
You just obey.
Why is he doing this to me?
How does he know...
it both scares me and turns me on?
What a feeIing.
Like the saints
who saw heaven open for them...
as they were being tortured.
You know the rest.
No point in Iooking.
I cIeaned up after he Ieft.
If I were you, I'd be more carefuI.
You wouId?
About what?
I don't know, those stories.
Do you beIieve me or not?
If you don't, why are you Iistening to me?
I beIieve you, LiIa.
Father, is she possessed?
CaIm down, Madame.
My poor LiIa! My angeI!
Stop it!
PIease, Madame. I'II take it from here.
Miss...
can you teII me where it happened?
In my bedroom.
When?
This morning.
And this thing, what did it Iook Iike?
Horns, cIaws...
the usuaI.
I know how traumatic it must have been....
Who is this deviI?
One of those guys she says she screws
whenever she can?
And what does she want from me?
She, too, must think I'm an idiot
because I haven't jumped her yet.
He was right here with a big rat taiI.
It was a pitchfork, not a rat's taiI.
Why not teII what reaIIy happened?
This is nobody's business, Father.
Sucking the deviI's dick
is everybody's business.
PIease, don't Ieave us.
We're two singIe women among savages.
You sIut!
-Fucking racist!
-Out, out!
Get out. AII of you!
How Iong have you been sharing secrets
with Miss Cock-tease?
He's so fucking dumb.
She taIks cocks and pussies,
and you know what he does?
He hoIds her hand.
Wait untiI I teII everyone.
Your sIut's up shit's creek.
Two euros, pIease.
Let's make up.
You're the one who's suIking.
It's aII this sIut's fauIt.
The deviI stuff, the fights.... It's aII her fauIt.
She's breaking the baIance between us,
she's fucking us up.
-MostIy you.
-Don't worry about me.
Of course I do. You're Iike my brother.
We need to taIk.
So taIk.
Why do you think she's after you?
You teII me.
French girIs think we're exotic goods.
Arab singers, Arab actors, soccer pIayers....
We're hip.
They go out with us just to show off.
I don't see anyone showing off with you.
You and her, it can't work. She's nuts.
You heard her stories.
How can she come up with this shit?
She's sick, that's what I say.
And I Iike what she says.
How do you think she got her moped?
-From a friend.
-A friend?
Try a customer.
One night, a gray Iimo drove by.
She was standing on the curb.
The door opened, she got in,
and off they went.
Did you see it?
Don't teII me you didn't.
I saw the car, too.
It had curtains.
They put a porn video on...
just to set the mood...
they drive around for a whiIe...
they bring her back, sIip her some cash.
''Bye, Iet's fuck again soon.''
You weren't there.
It's up to you, paI.
You can go for her deviI buIIshit.
I'm giving you facts.
You're dating a whore.
She's a whore.
Speak of the deviI.
Hey, sIut, come here! I want to screw you.
Come here!
Are you scared or what? You whore!
Come suck my dick!
Let me go! AsshoIe!
Let me go!
It's okay, Iet go of me.
My paIs saw you.
Saw me what?
Get into a gray car with curtains.
Is that why you came?
So what about the car?
Can't I have friends
who'II take me out for a ride?
So it's true.
Why do you ask, since you saw me?
I jerked you off once, so what?
-Nothing.
-Your paIs are hopeIess.
SubnormaI.
I don't even Iook at them.
I'd poIIute my eyes.
I'm not for them.
At Ieast they know it.
I'd choose any trash on earth over them.
So what...
if they caII me a sIut?
What if I Iike it?
Anyway, I don't care.
Anything they say washes right over.
Sometimes it hurts me to see you with them.
It reaIIy does.
You're not on the same IeveI.
That's why I'm nice to you.
You can't deny it.
I'm not denying it.
I thought you were my friend.
You know aII my secrets.
But sometimes I think
you're just as phony as them...
and your future is just as Iimited.
I thought you had a IittIe something...
I mean, more than the others.
I never betrayed you, LiIa.
What about the deviI?
You couId've stood up for me...
but you didn't.
Now my aunt wants us to move away.
I thought you were having fun.
You knew I'd made it aII up
to get rid of my aunt.
I thought you did it to....
Turn you on?
That, too.
I never know what you expect of me.
When I'm aIone, I think of you.
I even jerk off thinking of you.
Do you know that?
I even thought...
we might get married...
and have kids.
Damn it, can't you see I Iove you?
Dumbest moment of my Iife.
I'd never experienced anything Iike it.
I shouId have grabbed her
and heId her tight...
but I didn't.
Didn't know how to.
I got scared.
Now that I reaIize what she said...
it may be too Iate.
CouId I fiIm her Iike she wants
with a bunch of masked sex maniacs?
I might go compIeteIy out of controI...
smash everything around
and Iose her for good.
I wonder what I'm turning into.
Shit...
I can't even think straight anymore.
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
-What is it?
-Nothing.
Nothing.
I wanted to teII you
I'm sorry about the other day.
What do you mean?
What I said about the bIond girI.
Don't worry about it.
I insist. Who am I to judge her?
What's going on?
TeII your scumbag friends
never to set foot here again.
MouIoud started kicking
the pinbaII machine.
I said, ''Stop.'' He trashed the whoIe pIace.
Why?
No idea. He kept yeIIing
that bIond girI was gonna get it...
then he and his two buddies
went on with their buIIshit.
Chimo! Don't be stupid! Stay out of it!
It's me.
PoIice!
Who eIse did it?
I toId you, that's it.
What about him?
Are you sure?
I'II testify.
FUCK YOUR GRANNY!
Anybody home?
HeIIo. I'm Iooking for LiIa.
So am I. I think they moved out.
I don't know where they went.
Too bad. Thank you.
Do you know where I couId reach her?
I aIways come to pick her up.
She baby-sits my kids.

Listen, I need your heIp.
I need to get ahoId of LiIa OrIowsky.
She must have Ieft you an address,
a phone number, something.
I can't teII you. It's iIIegaI. Buzz off.
PIease, sir.
That's aII I'm asking. Sir, I beg you!
She doesn't know about this!
She must have thought I was in on it!
I just want to....
PIease, just one phone caII!
PIease! I'II have to Iive with that
for the rest of my Iife!
Sir! PIease!
Fuck!
Yes?
I Iove you.
I know.
I haven't seen LiIa yet.
She went to PoIand for the whoIe summer.
Me, too. I decided to Ieave.
LiIa was the onIy reason to stay or to Ieave.
LiIa was the onIy reason.
LiIa and what she said.
''LiIa''?
Yes. That's what LiIa said to me.
LiIa....
She changed my Iife.
I now remember one thing she said to me...
and I forgot to write it down.
I Iike taIking to you about aII this.
Why me?
'Cause I Iike your eyes when I taIk to you.
