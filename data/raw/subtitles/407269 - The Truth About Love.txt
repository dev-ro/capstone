Valentine's Day.
Saint Valentine.
Patron saint of bee keepers...
epilepsy...
fainting... the plague...
and of course...
love.
Love, love, love, love
love, love, love...
Maybe I should send
her a valentine.
She'd never know.
I'll radish you.
It's funny and witty, Razor sharp.
She'll love it.
I won't. I will. I won't. I will.
I have.
I've just sent a valentine to
my best friend's wife!
Fuck!
Hiya.
Hello, Freddie.
Now try not to forget...
they're not suppositories.
You take them orally.
Okay Thank you.
Darling.
Get off, you...
I am the ball's
official photographer.
Hey, you're looking good
for a man in a skirt.
Thank you, sweetie.
Bloody hell.
- Sorry. No taxis.
- Hello, darling.
Hi, Archie.
- So, shall we?
- Yes.
See you in court.
You're a genius.
Hey, don't go bolstering
that bastard's ego.
So, did you like my valentine?
- Oh, yeah. Very sexy.
- Sexy?
Well, of course. It was from you.
It's delicious.
Have you tried some?
Feed me.
Okay, close your eyes.
Radish?
Your valentine, silly.
Oh, sweetheart. I'm really sorry
I forgot to post it.
Then who sent this?
I'll radish you?
What a sad do.
It was really sweet.
So my baby sister's got
a secret admirer.
With a thing about root vegetables.
Darling, you're a beautiful woman,
and someone's got
the hots for you.
Sam reckons it's one of
my patients.
- Hey, you could have a wild affair.
- You haven't seen my patients.
Anyway, you think
you've got problems?
Yeah, But they're all married.
Toby's single.
I never did understand
your relationship with Toby.
By the way... I persuaded Henry
to try some Viagra, plus half an 'E'.
- Felicity. That's very dangerous.
- Certainly is.
I've been walking like John Wayne
ever since.
You tried it out on Sam yet?
We're fine.
Fine. Oh, dear God,
it's worse than I thought
It's great. Really.
Very nice.
Alice, anyone that thinks
that screwing is nice
is confusing sex with sewing.
Oh, yes.
I wouldn't kick him out of bed.
Oh, Nice plinth.
Would you like a sample?
- I'd like the whole package.
- It's our new line.
'Anonymous.' A hint of mystery
with a dark
promise of forbidden excitement.
Just what you need, darling.
Bloody hell.
How long have you been at this?
It takes as long as it takes.
Yeah? But then what?
I just wanna see her saiL again.
After that... who knows.
Maybe I'll just sit on the deck,
a glass of whisky in hand and...
watch the sun go down.
I don't know, mate.
You're a one off. You really are.
Your department, I believe.
A few more than I said, I'm afraid.
Looks like Dan's on a fruit
and nut diet.
- Still need notes for Monday?
- Mmm. Sorry.
Hey, quick drink before you starts?
Are you not going home
to your beautiful wife?
She's out on the piss
with her beautiful sister.
Oh, go on. What do you say?
Nah, I've got to get on with this,
haven't I?
Mysterious, yet slightly naughty,
for the femme fatale of today.
It's not me.
A single sniff turns tongue tied boys
into fluent cunnilinguists.
- Oh, did Sam like your card?
- Suppose so.
Bit weird, really.
He said it was sexy.
Sexy?
A picture of Marge Simpson?
Oh, bugger.
- Maybe his other card was sexy.
- What other card?
The one he's not telling you
about, dummy
He's obviously got
a secret admirer too.
Excuse me, your table's ready.
He would have told me
when I showed him mine.
Darling, you're forgetting,
he's a man.
You're a nurse, you should know
They've got smaller brains than us.
So they can fit them into
their penises.
I don't know why you sleep with
so many men.
You obviously don't like them.
llike bits of them.
Not all married men are like
your boyfriends know.
Of course they are.
- It's just a question of opportunity.
- It's a question of trust.
If someone fancied Sam,
he'd tell me straight away.
He would.
Okay. Prove it.
I got one with nothing on it.
Must be from Henry. Silent type.
Come on. Ten quid says
he doesn't tell you.
Hundred says he does.
Deal.
So, you liked it then?
Henry.
Oh, it was so sweet.
I was just showing to Alice.
Ooh, still at attention!
Oh can't you see
You belong to me
No, no. No, please.
Please don't post it.
Mum always said you got me
into trouble.
What?
Trying to remember the last time
I saw you naked.
A Little mystery never did any harm.
Hello, sexy.
Good morning.
The head lines at eight o'clock.
Footballer Dan Harlow begins his
refute allegations libel action today
Hey, You all right?
Fine.
- That will be Martin.
- That will be Martin.
Yeah?
Hi, Martin.
Oh, look, your case is on the news.
Of football's bright young players.
Dan Harlow is suing a major
national newspaper for alleging
- That he had three in a bed
- Yeah, listen, mate, I'll call you back.
Sex romps with a married couple.
Harlow's wife, actress Miranda
conspicuously Campbell,
is conspicuously absent today.
Bristol's up and coming Libellawyer,
Sam Holbrook, has taken the case...
but with the story backed by
numerous photographs, observers here
are questioning the wisdom
of bringing this case to court
in the first place.
Gotta run.
Bye, darling.
He even kept the lock of hair.
Good job Henry keeps
that dog clean.
- Anyway, at least there's an upside.
- What?
I'm a hundred quid richer.
Repeat after me 'Felicity was right'.
He just didn't wanna hurt my feelings.
It's not like he's gonna run off
and have an affair or anything.
Sorry.
- I'll prove it.
- How?
I don't know. I'll text him. Something
raunchy. See if he responds.
- He'll know it's from your phone.
- I'll buy a new one.
- And if he rings?
- He won't ring.
I'll talk to him then.
And when he recognises
your voice?
I'll be all sexy.
Go on then, let's hear it.
And more to the point,
what would you say?
You know Filthy things.
Alice. The nearest you get to
filthy is gardening.
So what's it gonna be
'Come and play with my begonias'?
Hello, Sam.
This is Anonymous.
Would you like to prune my bush?
Actually, that's not bad.
Innocent yet knowing,
with just a hint of slapper.
Every man's perfect woman.
Do you swap ends at half time?
Who are you playing for next,
Danny? Queen's Park Rangers?
Arsenal, more like
Shut it, you. Dan ain't
no pillowbiter, right?
You know these guys.
Just a bit of fun, yeah?
Fun? Any more fun like that
and we'll lose the Yorkie contract.
Where the hell's Miranda? The jury
needs to see her supporting you.
Filming, mate. It's what she does.
Aye, aye. Blonde eyebrows.
Blonde eyebrows, blonde kebab.
Me and my boyfriend Paul,
we're both bisexual.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Just get double the fun that way.
We get chatting to Dan in the bar...
and Paul asks him
about being a gay icon.
Wonders if it goes any further than
So Dan says
'Why don't we go and find out?'
So Mr Harlow invited you
to his hotel?
That's a Lie.
Dan ain't no chutney badger!
Flic, what underwear
have you got on?
Alice, maybe you should think
this through.
Anonymous doesn't think.
She does.
Talk about stamina.
First me, then Paul...
then the two of us together.
He couldn't get enough of it.
And who took the photographs?
Them? Well, me and Paul.
We like to keep a few souvenirs,
you know?
Very valuable souvenirs
Hey, it weren't like that.
We had a lovely time.
In the morning, Dan started
calling us all sorts of names...
so we thought stuff him.
If he's gonna be like that,
then he deserves all he gets.
Thank you.
No more questions, m'lud.
Mr. Holbrook?
Sam.
No questions, m'Lud.
Haven't seen him for a while.
- Martin.
- Martin.
- It might be important.
- This is important.
Oh, hi, Martin. What's up, mate?
Yeah. No problem.
I'll see you then.
You had your chance
and you blew it.
Oh, hi.
Breakfast is served.
Unfortunately, I've gotta run.
Archie's asked us round
for dinner tonight.
Tonight?
I'm sorry. Martin wants to go
over some paperwork.
But you go, eh?
See you later.
Hello.
When you're ready, mate.
Do I get a discount for
these silences?
Mr. Sharpe.
As Dan Harlow's personal manager...
could you tell the Court your
recollections of the evening of the
17th of June last year?
Yeah, well, you see, what with
Miranda off working, I knew that
Dan would be on his tod...
so invited him round for
a bit of nosebag.
You know, spag bol, can of lager,
couple of games of snooker.
And then about half ten,
he toodled off home.
- Are you sure about the time?
- Yes.
See, Buffy was about to start,
and I never miss it.
How far is your home
from the hotel
where the alleged incident
took place?
Hundred miles, give or take.
So for Mr. Harlow to have been
there by eleven...?
He would have needed
a time machine.
Sorry, just on my way
to lunch. Anything?
Didn't text, didn't ring. I was right,
you were wrong.
Perfect husband.
Darling, I've had dozens of those.
God! Oh my God!
Flic! It's ring!
Hi.
Bastard! What do I do?
I don't know, do I? It was your
stupid idea in the first place.
- It was your idea.
- Huh, The phone wasn't my idea.
Maybe he's just ring to say
that he's happily married.
There's one way to find out.
Hello.
- Hello.
- No.
Hello?
Hello... Sam.
What am I wearing?
Cheeky sod!
I'm not taking my clothes off.
Nothing. I'm wearing nothing.
I'm completely, totally...
naked.
And I'm...
Late?
Waiting...
for you.
Thinking about you.
Naked.
Feeling...
touching... myself.
My nipples are...
hard.
Well, you are very naughty.
Are you? Really?
I can feel you.
Close your eyes.
Don't stop. Don't stop...
Good, good, good!
You all right, mate? Lunch?
This is fucking war!
Hang on, you obviously enjoyed it.
That's not the point.
I had phone sex with my husband.
He had phone sex with
a complete stranger.
I want his testicles on a plate!
Then I think I might use
the cheese grater on his knob!
Some men would pay
good money for that.
And give him a chillipowder enema.
That too.
Then I'll cut off his foreskin
and feed it to the cat!
Oh, thank you, Alice.
I only come here for the scenery.
Mr. Sharpe.
You're President of the Railway
Restoration Society, I believe?
Yeah, Childhood passion of mine,
steam trains.
- Choo- choo.
- So you probably remember this?
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's me.
That's when I was guest
of honour. Your Honour.
There's a clock in the photograph.
What time does it read?
Ten twenty.
What does that banner
above your head say?
Railway Restoration Society Dinner,
June...
the 17th... 2004.
Putting your stupid heads together
and deciding to Lie under oath.
That's not only perjury,
that's conspiracy to pervert
the course of fucking justice!
All right. Listen, he didn't do it.
Oh, yeah. Right,
and you're Mother Theresa.
I wasn't there.
Dan, are you holding
something back?
You gotta help us out.
We're struggling here.
Tell him.
Okay.
- You know Miranda, right?
- The invisible wife?
Sam, please.
Before the story broke
she told me she was pregnant.
And now she's saying
she doesn't want to raise a child
with someone like me.
She means everything to me, mate.
He loves her.
He has even got 'Miranda 4 Ever'
tattooed on his arse.
- Hip.
- Arse.
- Hip.
- Arse.
- CLife.
- That is your Arse.
CLiff, why don't you go
and get us some coffee?
- Thank you.
- Arse.
Go on, Danny.
Look, when all this crap came out,
she went ballistic.
I tried to say it wasn't me, but with
all the pictures in the papers...
Oh, so that's why you went
along with CLiff's story?
So, Dan, what were you doing
that night?
Nothing. I was at home alone
while Miranda was out filming.
What do men look for in a woman?
Delia Smith in the kitchen
and Heidi Fleiss in the bedroom.
I think I'm a bit too Delia
in the bedroom.
Boring.
Why doesn't Sam
call me and talk dirty?
Because I'm too 'Alice'?
Or maybe...
Maybe what?
Maybe he did know.
Just playing along.
Do you really think so?
Yeah.
But two can play at that game,
can't they?
'Shag Actually'? That's porn.
It's not porn, darling. It's erotica.
'My Best Friend's Spreading'?
No. I thought you meant sex kitten,
not sex monster.
Hey. Maybe I could watch
a couple of those movies with you?
I get off at six.
Who with, your right hand?
Oh, yeah.
'Butt Detective'?
That's you sorted
for the next few nights.
Bollocks! I'm supposed to
be at Archie's!
Bye.
Hello, Martin
Oh God, I've missed you.
Hello, love- rat.
It's all work and no play with Sam.
- Oooh.
- Fuck up.
Careful, that's a hundred
quid bottle of wine.
Pinched it from Sam's 'cellar'.
Here, let me.
One of the more useful things
I learnt at college.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
'A Cock On The Lips Now'?
I thought you liked
romantic comedies.
It's research.
A new surgery the practice
want me to run.
How to maintain a healthy sex Life
in monogamous relationships.
I hate to tell you this, but I don't
think these reflect reality too much.
Don't forget I Stay Hard All Night.
'I Stay Hard All Night'. I told you
they don't reflect reality.
Oh my God, that's Jenny Clough!
- Who?
- Jenny Clough.
Had a thing about Sam at uni.
Christian fundamentalist.
Oh my God! Let's put it on,
Let's watch it! Come on!
Oh, what's got into you
tonight, hmm?
I think you know.
God... it was great, wasn't it?
The whole phone sex thing, hmm?
You had phone sex?
With another woman?
No.
Did I?
But I thought it was you.
Why would it be me?
Who else would it be?
I don't know.
Maybe it was your wife.
Katy.
I think I would have recognised
my own wife, hmm?
Besides, Alice could never be that...
What?
Filthy.
Christ.
The blonde?
What?
Such a fantastic painting, Katya.
You can't make me jealous.
I'm immune.
Wives get jealous not lovers.
Get down on your knees!
You can't get much more
fundamental than that.
She was always going on
about eternal punishment.
Hang on. Wasn't she a vegetarian?
Can blow jobs really get you off
a speeding ticket?
Always worked for me.
Have you done that?
She's a contortionist.
So is he by the looks of things.
Can't you do that?
You're funny. That's funny.
Coffee
Archie what turns you on?
I mean generally. What was it about
Beth that really got you going?
That she'd have me?
Did she dominate you
in the bedroom?
Did she dominate me? She
dominated me all over the house.
I'm just trying to... find out
what men look for in a woman.
A pulse?
Actually, there was one time...
that Beth phoned me
in the middle of the day,
and I was at work...
and she told me that she wasn't
wearing any knickers.
And that evening
we went out for dinner...
and you know,
knowing that we both knew it.
And I was wearing a pair of
very tight jeans.
And I couldn't walk.
You know what they say
about the perfect woman?
A blind nymphomaniac heiress
who lives above a pub.
With big tits, obviously.
What would I do without you?
Flic.
I think I've been going about
this the wrong way.
Are you Listening? Flic?
Darling, could we talk about
this tomorrow?
Darling, I'm really swamped here.
Please. Please, no.
You didn't even notice the outfit.
That thing Flic gave you?
I thought you said it was itchy?
Sam I'm afraid.
Come here, silly.
I'm just a bit snowed under
Right now, yeah?
So what about that fancy pad you
two bought? Where was it?
I'm getting rid of it.
Are you crazy? Must have loads
of pulling power.
You would know
if you'd ever bothered
to come round and have a look.
You've got to romance them.
Flowers. Take them for dinner.
Women like surprises.
Oh, shit, fuck, bollocks!
You all right, mate?
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
So, um... when was the last time
you surprised Alice?
That's different. We're married.
You know what they say
about married women.
They're always fantasying
about other men.
And what's that supposed
to mean?
Nothing. Doesn't mean anything.
I'm just saying.
Hey...
You may have seen her first,
but I asked her out. Remember?
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.
Hi.
- Ooh. What have you done?
- Oh, it's nothing. It's just a...
Inside.
Now.
Do you remember
when we were students
and we went to that karaoke party?
We both got so drunk
we ended up saying
we were gonna go to Japan
and climb Mount Fuji.
Japan. We were going
everywhere that night.
Yeah. Well, guess what?
I've been asked to go to Japan.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
It's a new law firm in Tokyo.
Partner.
We'd really miss you.
- No, No, No, No, no...
- No, Listen, I've been thinking.
He obviously knows
Anonymous is me,
just doesn't want to break the spell.
Secret meeting could be exciting.
Exciting?
I'm going to blind fold him.
Alice, I really don't think
you've thought this through.
Flic, I have.
Why can't you be
a bit more supportive?
Because I don't want to see
you fuck up your marriage.
And, of course, fucking up
marriages isn't something
you'd know anything about?
Yeah, well. At least none of
my men are lying to me.
My rat! How romantic.
Hey. If I don't get hold of you soon
I might have to do some DIY.
You're like dog on heat.
What is it?
That woman again?
Yes.
She sent me a note.
Wants to meet tonight.
Give.
I threw it away.
Expensive perfume.
- Are you going?
- Of course not.
What do you take me for?
A cheating love-rat.
Your cheating love-rat.
You're so cute when you're scared.
You know what I don't own you.
It's your Life.
You want to go, you go.
I'm not going. Okay?
Hello.
Just tell me where.
I'll text you.
Alice! Come in.
Archie, I need a favour.
Big favour.
Sure, whatever.
Do you want a drink?
No.
You know that f lat you
and Beth bought?
It's back on the market.
I know. It's just this friend
of mine from... work...
she needs somewhere
to meet this guy.
What, do you mean like an affair?
Kind of.
What's her name?
Anonym...
...bella.
Anonabella?
She's South African
We just call her Bella.
Right.
Can she not use your place?
No, No.
Sam wouldn't approve.
Sam doesn't know?
Promise not to tell him.
What's to tell? It's not like I've
ever met this 'Anonabella', is it?
No.
You'd have remembered her.
She's very... sexy.
I've always thought so.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Are you sure?
Just work.
This is my last favour, I promise.
Alice, I don't want any more
to do with it, okay?
It's shopping.
I'll get my coat.
Thanks, Flic. You're great.
Are you sure you want to do this?
It's gonna work. I know it is.
Now, there's just one more thing.
Hithere.
Go on.
She wants a BraziLian.
Get on your knees.
Get down on your knees.
Bastard.
- Why The blindfold?
- It's part of the game.
- Don't you want to play?
- Of course.
No.
I feel so excited.
Get on your knees.
Touch me.
You looked amazing in court today.
Hello?
Anonymous.
You stay away from my man.
With your sleazy letters
and your f lashy perfume.
You're nothing to him.
He's mine.
Okay? Bitch!
Once more and I'll fucking kill you!
My friend says thank you.
Come in.
Sam's having an affair.
Sam is?
Are you sure?
She made it perfectly clear.
I don't know what to say, I mean...
How could he do that?
How could he...?
I'm gonna call him right now.
No, please, Archie,
don't say anything.
I just need to deal with this
in my own way.
- Maybe it's my fault.
- Don't say that.
Don't say that, it's not your fault.
What am I gonna do?
I don't want to lose my marriage.
Look, I know this...
sometimes men, they can...
they can separate sex and,
and love. They can.
That's comforting.
He does love you.
Yesterday I would have
believed that.
He obviously doesn't find me
attractive any more.
I mean, God, when I think about it...
I mean where has he really been
all those times?
Nights in chambers,
dinners with clients.
I feel so...
What right has he got?
What's she got that I haven't?
Well?
Don't be silly.
Alice, don't be silly.
You...
are gorgeous.
Really, really gorgeous.
Then why doesn't he want me?
Because he's stupid.
Oh God.
Sorry.
She was all...
tall and sexy and exotic.
Russian or something.
- God. Don't you just hate that?
- And a bit painty.
- Painty?
- I don't know.
Maybe she was a decorator
or something.
You know the worst thing?
There was Sam... on his knees
in front of me, and there was this...
I can't describe it.
Intense desire.
He used to feel that way about me.
It's not there any more, unless
he thinks I'm someone else.
Look...
maybe you should think
about getting out.
I hate to say this, but if he's having
an affair, men like that don't change.
And I kissed Archie.
What?
- Tongues?
- Flic, It was everything
Tongues, Lips, hands.
What have I done?
I mean, Archie's the last person
in the world I'd want to hurt.
Doesn't sound very painful to me.
Sounds rather scrumptious.
That was the point.
It was so...
Anyway...
it wasn't me that kissed him.
It was Anonymous.
Right.
Morning, Sam.
All right, Archie?
Hey, who pissed in your porridge?
Mr. Webb, can I conclude that
what you're saying is that
these pictures have been
digitally enhanced?
Yes, certain minor elements
of the picture have been enhanced...
A simple yes or no will suffice.
So according to Mr. Webb here,
we can no longer assume
that these pictures...
that the defendants claim were
taken on the night in question...
relate in any way to the events
they supposedly portray.
Mr. Webb.
Could you outline for us exactly
where you have identified
digital enhancement?
Well, a couple of them have been
f Lipped to improve the composition.
The most noticeable change is...
here. Just at the edge.
The bedside lamp has been removed.
The most significant change,
you say?
And have you been
able to identify
any alterations to the persons
in the photographs?
No. Not really.
In fact.
None. Thank you, Mr. Webb.
Great, I'm being hung out to dry here
and I'm getting nothing from you.
Sam, don't start on me, okay?
Look, let's face it,
we're stuffed al ready.
So unless you can come up
with something very quickly,
I'm putting Dan on the stand.
And where's that gonna get us?
Sympathy. It's damage
Limitation time for me.
I've got it!
I'm gonna win him back.
What?
No, don't you see? When Sam
finds out I'm Anonymous...
he's gonna have a wife
and a mistress in one.
He's never gonna
wanna stray again.
Sorry, Dan.
You're stuffed.
Wait a minute.
Hip, arse, hip, arse...
What do you want?
I have to see you.
I'll text you.
Come on. Come on.
There must be. There must be.
Yes. Yes!
Alice. Hi.
About last night.
I'm sorry.
I was, you know,
I should never have...
with you being so upset about...
You don't have to apologise.
I knew you were just trying
to make me feel...
Yeah, I know, but I was completely
out of order and I'm...
so sorry.
Me, too.
Archie, I couldn't borrow
that key again, could I?
For my friend.
Alice, you don't have to lie to me.
Sauce for the goose, right?
I didn't say that.
But you're still gonna sneak off
for some pathetic Little fuck...
with some fuck knows who in dear
old Archie's fucking apartment!
Look, look...
if Sam really loves you
and you really love him...
then stop pissing about
and be with him! Stay with him!
But, if you don't, then just...
Archie, please.
No.
No...
I've had enough.
For you...
sex bomb.
Love-rat.
How sweet.
Bastard. Fucking bastard!
Low-Life fucking bag of shit!
- What have I done?
- What have you done?
You saw her.
You saw Anonymous.
Katya, darling, I wouldn't even...
You Liar. I followed you.
I saw you go in and ten minutes
later I saw her come out.
- You saw her?
- Yes.
What did she look like?
What did she look like?
You nasty Little rodent.
Hey, come on. What could I have
done in ten minutes?
Fuck her ten times!
Go away.
Fuck off
Go and don't come
- You don't mean that.
- I mean it!
Katy. Sweetheart.
I'd be lost without you.
And whose bum am I gonna bite
if not yours?
The truth, right?
Yeah, I did see her, but for
ten minutes. And you know why?
Why?
Because that's how long...
it took to tell her...
exactly what I thought
about being stalked.
Stalked?
Oh, yeah.
She's a friggin'looney.
Are you lying to me?
You know what I wish?
I wish it could be just the two of us.
No Alice, no stalker,
just you and me.
Don't you think
I don't want that too, huh?
Listen. This case will be over soon.
And when it is...
big surprise coming your way.
Promise.
All rise.
M'Lud, may I approach the bench?
Your Honour, I must
deeply apologise,
but it seems neither my client...
nor my solicitor have yet arrived.
And with your permission,
may I request a brief adjournment...
as I attempt to locate
their whereabouts?
Sam. Sam.
I'm putting Dan on the stand.
No, no, you don't understand.
Sam, this isn't Dan.
As you can see, Your Honour,
they have arrived.
Now may I request your permission
to call Daniel Harlow to the stand?
Sorry I'm late.
Well, bugger me backwards!
Don't be stupid, it weren't Danny
in he photographs,
it was a bloody look a like,
weren't it?
You bastard! Sorry, Dan, sorry.
You bastard! You've cost me
money, you have.
Well, you could have come
forward sooner.
I know, I know, man,
but you know don't want the wife
finding out now, did I?
Do you know what I mean?
But as soon as your man came
forward and told me about your bird...
figured I'd better come clean.
So how did you do it?
The photograph had been
f Lipped, right?
So actually it was his left hip
that was showing.
Left hip, but no tattoo.
Archie, you're good.
Don't give me that. You were
gonna put him on the stand,
and we made him a promise.
I didn't.
Bollocks. Listen, Archie,
I've got a lunch.
Actually, I need you to go over
some of my notes with me, please.
I win the case, you do
the paperwork, huh?
Besides, my head's somewhere
else right now.
Yeah, up your arse.
Oh, Sam
Who are...?
Remember this.
I never thought letting go
completely could be so amazing.
I'll do anything for you.
Anything at all.
Take off your blindfold.
No, wait.
I want this feeling to last.
I want you to see who I am.
No, Listen.
I've never set eyes on you
but I know...
I'm in love with you.
I mean, God, I've said
that a million times before but...
suddenly I realise I've never
really meant it.
It's never been like this.
Not with Katya. She's just sex.
And Alice...
Yes?
Alice...
is nothing compared to you.
Hello?
Bollocks!
Couldn't stay away?
Put it on.
Love-rat.
- Fuck!
- Come on, love-rat.
Take me.
Yes?
No, it's wrong number.
No, it's not Sam's... Phone.
Sam, what's going on?
I'm gonna kill that slut!
I'm going to naiL your scrotum
to the ceiLing!
Open the door!
Cleaning lady. Come here.
Open the door.
What? Stop staring at me.
Open the fucking door!
Oh, come on!
Anonymous.
We award the plaintiff the sum
of one million pounds.
Yes! Go Lazio!
Order!
Order!
- Mr. Sharpe.
- Yes.
This case may be over, but there is
another matter outstanding.
Arrest this man for perjury.
- Oh, fuck off!
- And contempt.
What? Bollocks!
And resisting arrest.
See you in court!
I'll be making a statement
in a moment.
I did it, Archie. I did it.
Yeah, that's right, you did it,
you won.
Yes. This is the most perfect day
of my Life.
And that is the perfect woman.
Sam...
you married the perfect woman.

Thank you.
No, double glazing isn't
a big priority for me right now.
Alice?
Alice?
You okay?
It's me.
Alice?
Katya.
Where...?
What are you doing here?
Did you do this?
Where's Alice?
Where... is Alice?
Have you lost your mind?
I'm telling her about us.
And Anonymous.
Darling.
What did you call her?
Katya... my wife, Alice.
Alice, Katya. Junior clerk.
Hello.
I'm not a junior clerk.
And she's not your wife.
She is Anonymous.
I want to see Alice.
You've just been introduced.
She's Anonymous, I saw her.
Now you're just being ridiculous.
Darling?
Remember this?
Darling?
Sorry.
Really I am.
I had no idea.
It was all so...
Exciting.
Dangerous.
Dirty.
Sexy.
Yeah.
It was.
- You were...
- I was cheated on.
You couldn't give a shit,
could you?
It doesn't matter who you shag.
You even cheated on
your mistress.
What kind of bastard does
that make you, Sam?
But...
now we've found each other again.
You don't get it at all, do you?
I found you ages ago.
You only found me
when you were cheating on me.
What does that make me?
I fought to stay with you, Sam,
because I loved you.
You cured me of that.
You don't know where I can find
a good lawyer, do you?
I've gone off married men.
Oh my God.
Oh my God!
Archie, you're such a fool.
Hello.
Hello?
Alice.
Hello, Alice.
Hello.
Right, okay.
I knew that Bella wasn't really...
I mean, I knew that you were
having... an affair with your...
Oh, for God's sake, Archie,
get a grip.
The newspaper.
Er...
Um?
No, Listen.
I never realised what you...
I mean... I thought you...
- here was me thinking...
- Archie...
No, you see, I know
Bella wasn't really a person.
And I, I just assumed... it was only
natural really, and I was just so...
I thought you had someone else.
I didn't think for a minute
that you were... well...
with Sam. I mean, I know
you were with Sam, but not...
with Sam.
I couldn't stand the fact that you
hadn't chosen me for your affair.
Archie... I don't do affairs.
And even if I did,
I wouldn't choose you.
You're my friend.
Yeah, of course.
And I wouldn't wanna spoiL that.
No, me neither.
Are you okay?
Great.
Dear Alice
I would've come round
to say goodbye...
but I've been busy
getting the boat finished.
And to be absolutely honest,
I've been avoiding you.
Because once I knew you'd never
feel the same way about me
as I do about you...
the decision was easy.
I don't think I can face the thought
of bumping into you any more.
And I think it's time I had
a real adventure.
I've tried really hard, Alice,
believe me...
but I just can't seem to get you
out of my heart.
Love always. Archie.
PS... glad you liked the radishes.
Anything interesting?
And you're still here because...?
Archie!
Archie!
Archie!
You can't run off like this.
You all right there?
Where's the man
who owns the boat?
Used to own her.
He sold her to me.
Sold it? Why?
Flying's quicker, I guess.
Where's he gone?
Well, Japan. He took a job there.
He helped me cast off. Next time
I turned around he was gone.
Afraid of missing his train,
I suppose.
The train on platform three is the
19.24 service to London Paddington.
Shit!
Please, I really have to...
Get a ticket. Over there.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, love, you'll have to join
the queue like everyone else.
Could you just let me in?
We've all been waiting.
- Please, I've real ly...
- Ticket!
You are such a shit!
Not you.
Peter, did that last announcement
come out?
Yes, sounded fine.
Where's Jill?
I'm leaving at half past.
Oh, d'you not hear?
She's called in sick.
No! I've been stuck in this booth
for bloody hours!
And I'm the replacement.
You can't go in there!
She's locked the bloody door!
Well unlock it! I can't,
she's got the key.
Get out in there.
- Archie. No!
- Miss, open The door.
No!
Archie. Archie!
Archie Gray. Please don't go.
I grew the radishes!
- Hey, Come out Of there.
- Shut up, will you?
Just shut up!
Please don't go.
Thank you. Thank you.
I got your letter,
I'm not letting you go to Tokyo.
Listen to me.
Bollocks!
Archie? Testing!
This is a security announcement.

- Thank you very much.
Archie, this is Alice.

Ooh, take me home and radish me!
