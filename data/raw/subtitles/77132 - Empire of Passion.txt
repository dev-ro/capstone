EMPIRE OF PASSION
1895. A village in japan
You must be tired
won't you have some, Seki?
-More hot water?
-No, I'm getting out now
was Toyoji here today?
He seems to come often
Yes, now he's out of the army
He ought to work, instead of
pestering others
Toyoji isn't in love with you, is he?
I'm as old as his mother!
You don't even look thirty. You're
still Little Seki to the villagers
They're good, my wife made them today
A special price for four
I'll lose on it, but you're
a good customer
what a lovely day. Are you hungry?
Care for a treat?
You're always spoiling me
with something
where did you buy them, Toyoji?
From the shop. They looked so
tempting, fresh made today
Delicious!
I'll try one, then. I'm always letting
you spoil me. Shall I make tea?
Later. Let's eat first
Toyoji isn't in love with you, is he?
Is anything wrong, Toyoji?
You look so serious
I often wonder why you come to see me
The last is for you, I insist
How about sharing it?
Little Seki, I thought she'd
forgotten us for her husband
She knows the secret of eternal youth
to keep her man happy
Seki, you have as many admirers
as ever
That must worry you, Gisaburo
Gracious lady, allow me to say
how happy I am for you today
Because of the sake, or because
of your happy nature?
Even drunk, I'm never drunk enough
to neglect my wife
Toyoji, don't stand there,
you are welcome
You ought to think of marriage, too.
How old are you?
As old as the bridegroom
You must have looked lovely
on your wedding day
Those children, up to their pranks
She's asleep
You're a lucky young man,
but don't hog it all
There's enough for both of us
Sleep, little treasure, or you
will break mother's heart
Dear lady
Toyoji
Don't catch cold from the draught
I had to lie down, my shoulders ached
I know how to cure that
Is that where it hurts?
Stop, Toyoki! Don't do that!
I'm only trying to make you feel
better, that's all
You're hurting me!
Relax, then. You like it, don't you?
At first you resisted, but now...
Toyoji, you needn't be so rough
It's cold here
The master of the house won't be
home until late
I can't get over it, Seki.
Look at that
At what?
Beautiful, eh?
Toyoji, you're embarrassing me
I want you to see what you do to me
Gisaburo will never understand.
we must stop, for his sake
Seki, only the first time counts.
And you know how you loved it
Don't say you wouldn't love it again
I've just remembered a story I heard
when I was a child
what was it about?
A woman who couldn't close her eyes
at night...
...because a prowler had raped her
while she slept
Seki, you've changed since
the first time
It's so easy to forget that you are
twenty years younger than me
Anyway, you know what I think?
I don't care if you are twenty years
older than me
But...
when we're apart, the thought of you
and you husband together drives me mad
Careful, father
You're going to sleep
I know, I'm so relaxed, Oshin
You haven't eaten much
I ate too much, now I must work it off
-Don't your employers feed you?
-I'm always hungry
-ls the work hard?
-No, but I'd rather go to school
There you'll learn to care for
children, as your mother did
School's a waste of time.
we can't afford it
It's useless. You'll learn nothing
but foolishness at school
I want a good life
That's how your mother talked
when she was young
She wanted a better life,
a better life
She's learned to be happy
with what she has
Your mother and father aren't
making love now, are they?
In the daytime?
See what she's doing, then come back
and tell me
who's there?
How are you?
It's not fit weather for ducks
-Toyoji, out in such a downpour?
-You see everything
we can't help seeing, anyway
I doubt if even the rickshaw-man
will go out in such weather
I bet I know what he's up to
with Seki!
So you haven't seen them today?
Not even a stray dog. It's
a miserable New Year's Day
won't you have tea with us, Toyoji?
Not today, thank you
I knew it was you
-It's dangerous here, people can see
-who's here to see us?
-where have you been?
-Taking something to my sick aunt
why are you out in this rain, Toyoji?
Come on, we've not met for ages
-where?
-To my house
-what about your brother?
-Donzo won't even know
No, it's getting late and
they'll be expecting me
who's expecting you?
Shave it
I'll shave it
-we must kill him
-who?
we must kill him
You don't want him to see you shaved
How will you stop him seeing tonight?
I'll make some excuse
If he sees, he'll want an answer
But I couldn't go through with
killing him
Like it or not, we must do it
-ls there no other way?
-No
I can't live without you now. I'll
kill him, if we both don't. Choose
what can I say?
what must I do? How do we do it?
we'll kill him and throw him into an
old well where he'll never be found
will the body vanish?
It will soon rot there, sink into the
mud. Soon there'll be nothing left
-what if we fail?
-we won't
How could it be so easy?
He must die, or we'll never be happy
Get him drunk on sake, then we'll
kill him
How much sake will it take?
Two bottles should be enough
-He drinks a lot
-You think it will take more?
He has a good head for drink.
Two bottles are nothing to him
Still, he won't suffer a hangover
It's too cold for this time of year.
An early winter is a bad sign
The first snow of the winter.
It's a real blizzard
It's time you were asleep, little one
I'm chilled to the marrow.
I was almost caught in the storm
-I had to run
-I'll warm sake for you
-won't that rust the scissors?
-well, it's me who sharpens them
I always say tuna is better than cod
Dried and salted, cut into strips
and snipped off with scissors
Your husband's lucky. I wish
my wife spoiled me like this
It's all for him? You're a good girl
My old woman wouldn't dream of
such a thing
All this alcohol makes me thirsty,
but will she let me have a drop? No!
Have a word with her. You might
make her see the light
You must have guests
Get me a cord, a length of rope...
not that
Something strong, for a man,
not a child
Pull as hard as you can
All you have to do is keep pulling
Don't let go
He's dead
Swear you won't say a word to anyone
Stop crying, you fool!
He's dead, it's all over now.
No one will ever know
But we must keep our mouths shut
what if they ask questions?
Say he's gone off to work in Tokyo.
He's in Tokyo, got that?
what about the body? How long do we
keep that thing?
-what?
-what are we going to do with that?
Throw him down an old well, I said
-But how to get him there?
-we'll have to carry him
what if someone sees us?
who? No one's out in this weather
All right, but we must hurry.
It's almost dawn
I can't go through with it!
we can't stop now
With the first winds of autumn,
the trees begin to shed their leaves
One by one, the pine needles fall
The peasants rake up the leaves for
fuel, they must not be wasted
That is the wisdom of the poor
But the woods belong to the Master,
and taking the leaves is theft
But the Master is tolerant
The poor continue to gather
the leaves
But that year, Toyoji developed
a curious trait
He carries his baskets of leaves
even further into the woods...
...and empties them into an old well
He cannot explain why, but he
cannot do otherwise
Something makes him do it
no one notices his strange behaviour
Until one day...
Toyoji, why gather leaves just to
throw them down a well?
I gathered them for fuel,
but they're no good
They're too damp, so I threw them away
Be careful of these old wells;
one false step, and you're finished
Young Master thinks no more of it,
and goes on his way
Toyoji also thinks no more of it,
and goes on as before
Been gathering leaves?
Three years pass
As the festival of ancestors neared,
people began to wonder
They talked about Gisaburo, whom
they hadn't seen for so long
Oshin, how you've grown
Visiting your mother?
She'll be pleased to see you
Thank you for your hard work
I'm sorry to go now, but I must
attend to my son
Seki, is it really your son
you must attend to?
Gisaburo must be doing well in Tokyo.
He must send you lots of money
I've had no news of him or his money
You must be worried, then
As he hasn't bothered to let me know
anything, he must be all right
Little Seki, Kurazo tells us that
Gisaburo came to him in a dream
Yes, it's at least a week ago
I didn't want to upset you
It was only a dream
He told me he was uncomfortable,
wearing the sames clothes for so long
He asked if I could bring him
fresh clothes
Kurazo would have done it,
if he knew where Gisaburo was
He wouldn't let Gisaburo down
Kurazo, I think your dream was
because you ate too much
No wonder, with his appetite
And Gisaburo's wife's the one
to bring him fresh clothes
But Seki never sleeps, she's too busy.
So she never dreams
Ishichi, did you light the fire again?
I did it
Oshin, I didn't expect you to be here
I didn't expect you until the holidays.
what are you doing here?
I keep dreaming that father is dead
You said he'd be back with lots of
money by New Year's Day
But two New Year's Days have passed
I think my father will never come home
well, you'd think he would have
sent word, at least
what if he is dead? He's always
dead in my dreams
Gisaburo, why have you come?
Please rest in peace
wait, I'll get you some
Seki, you're out at this hour?
So Gisaburo's come home at last?
why are you sleeping here?
I thought I was at home
You mustn't let anyone see you here.
Come on, we must go
Toyoji, you must spend the night
at our house
I'm frightened to stay alone
You know I can't do that
while Oshin is there
what if she is there?
If anyone found out, they'd say we
got rid of Gisaburo
we must wait a little longer
Toyoji, I wonder... are you
tired of me now?
would I be so worried if I weren't
in love with you? we must wait
For how long?
It's been three years
Now why all these rumours,
and ghosts appearing?
No sense in panicking, it won't last.
You must be patient
I can't go on
If you don't want to be alone,
ask Mistress to stay with you
I'm sure she wouldn't mind
She says she can't sleep, but her
snores keep me awake. As for ghosts...
It's a wonder she can sleep,
the noise she makes
I pity the man who sleeps with her,
it must kill all the fun
Still, I hope it keeps away ghosts,
I can well do without them
Anyway, Gisaburo has nothing to
reproach me for
Ghosts! You must be weird
to see such things
Good evening, Mistress.
Do you recognize me?
Gisaburo, the rickshaw-man
Good lady, please...
I saw him, the ghost!
I dreamt about father, too
It seemed he was in danger
Trying to get out of a hole, like an
old well, crying for help
It's you
I had to come here, because you
wouldn't stay with me
Denzo's here
It's not to make love. I'm afraid
the ghost will appear again
You think he won't appear here?
I feel he wouldn't dare to come here
-what's wrong with him?
-Nothing
I am Police lnspector Hotta.
I'd like a word
You scared me
Are you deaf?
Sorry, the ears are no good any more,
can't hear a thing
Answer a question, if you can...
...about the rickshaw-man
what I do know is, say what you like,
it's a fact...
...we need rain
The rickshaw-man
You'll have to speak up
Are you stone deaf?
Have you seen a ghost around here
lately?
G H O S T!
You're little Seki, aren't you?
Haven't you a surname?
Of course
-what's your husband's name?
-Gisaburo Desa
-ls he here?
-No, he's away, working
-where? In town?
-ln Tokyo, I think
-where in Tokyo?
-I don't really know
Surely his wife ought to know
-what does he do?
-He pulls a rickshaw
How long will he be away?
Don't you hear from him at all?
Can you show me one of his letters?
He can't read or write, I'm afraid
-How do you know he's in Tokyo, then?
-Someone saw him there
And who is this someone?
Is she your daughter?
Yes, she's here on holiday.
She'll go back to her job soon
-what's her name?
-Oshin
Oshin, your father hasn't tried
to contact you, has he?
we're told his spirit has returned.
Doesn't that disturb you?
I intend to find out what has
happened to him. Understand?
You've had no word from him for three
years. Isn't that rather curious?
Don't make me go home. I can't
sleep, I'm so afraid
Seki, you have no more to fear
from the police than from a ghost
The ghost isn't dangerous,
he can't harm you
But if the lnspector discovers
the truth...
But you haven't seen the ghost.
He's sucking the life out of me
It's very strange that Gisaburo
never appears to me
If he tells anyone he's in the
old well, we're lost
Seki, you must be strong
If we lose courage, we'll end up
at the end of a rope
You must be strong
we mustn't meet while the lnspector's
here. we don't want him to suspect
we mustn't meet while the lnspector's
here. we don't want him to suspect
You say such things now, but at
first you didn't care
when you shaved me, you didn't care
who knew
Please don't cry, Saki
I don't want to leave you.
I want to stay here
Don't worry. would I go through this
if it wasn't so we could be together?
Don't worry. would I go through this
if it wasn't so we could be together?
I can't bear to go on. I know you
can stand it, but I can't
Denzo! Charge!
Did the lnspector give you that?
Saki, go home. we must not be seen
together
Saki, go home. we must not be seen
together
Don't be afraid of the ghost.
Just give him some sake
Seki, you know what everyone says?
You have someone, and you're
getting this for him, then?
But I don't like this talk about a
ghost. Do you think he's jealous?
If he comes here, I'll give him
some advice
I'd tell him to help you by
resting in peace
I'd tell him to help you by
resting in peace
Seki, you don't look well.
I'm sorry if I've upset you
I don't like hearing about ghosts,
either
Seki, are you going home?
Get in, I'm going that way
No, I'd rather walk
Seki, won't you get in?
My poor little Seki
All right, I'll get in
Are we on the right road?
No, we're not
I must have forgotten the way home
Seki, you must guide me
Seki, you must guide me
we must turn back
I've no idea where we are.
Don't go so fast
I don't recognize this at all
I don't recognize this at all
If only I could tell where we are
No point in going on if you
don't know where you are
No point in going on if you
don't know where you are
Have you really forgotten the way?
Help, somebody!
I'm so afraid, Gisaburo
I'm so afraid, Gisaburo
Turn round, let me see who you are
Turn round, let me see who you are
Mother, what's happened?
I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
-Don't leave me
-You said you didn't want me to stay
-Because all you talk about is father
-lf I stay, I'll be reminded of him
Are you sure you don't know
where he is?
Are you sure you don't know
where he is?
I'll tell no one about my dream,
and I'll never come back again
what do you mean?
Don't go out alone at night.
It's bad to leave lshichi alone
Don't go out alone at night.
It's bad to leave lshichi alone
Little Seki, helping with the harvest?
Toyoji has plenty of time
to help you out
Toyoji has plenty of time
to help you out
Some people have no shame
They kill their husband if he finds
they've betrayed him
Some people gossip too much.
what if you were wrong?
Some people gossip too much.
what if you were wrong?
Don't say there's nothing fishy
Don't jump to conclusions
You'd have to be blind not to see,
what with all these strange goings-on
You'd have to be blind not to see,
what with all these strange goings-on
That's true
Every afternoon he goes off to the
woods, up to no good, I'm sure
Do you know what he does?
I hear he gathers a basket of leaves...
I hear he gathers a basket of leaves...
-
strange behaviour, if you ask me
Did you ever see him in the wood?
No, nor at my house, either!
Did you ever see him in the wood?
No, nor at my house, either!
There's nothing between us.
You're just gossiping
Thank you for your hard work
May I come in?
May I come in?
Young Master saw me throw leaves into
the well. If he tells the lnspector...
You think he will?
You think he will?
I'll listen to what they say
-what if the police question us?
-Go away, don't been seen here
Little Seki, are you in bed already?
I've cooked sweet potatoes for you
I've cooked sweet potatoes for you
wait, I'll let you in
Don't bother, I'll leave them outside
I didn't want to disturb you
if you were with someone
I didn't want to disturb you
if you were with someone
Gisaburo, please forgive me...
...but I've nothing here to drink
and I'm too tired to go and get some
would you like one?
would you like one?
Gisaburo, tell me...
...why haven't you denounced me?
...why haven't you denounced me?
Before you died, you must have seen
that it was me killing you
You know who killed you
So why don't you tell someone?
Answer me, will you?
Gisaburo, where are you going?
Please take me with you
Don't go
Seki, are you there?
Is that you, Toyoji?
Open the door
Just go away
I don't want to see you again
The lnspector is still here.
They may tell him about the well
I don't care, nothing matters
They can arrest me, I don't care
what they do
It couldn't be worse than all this...
...the aching when all hope is gone
Always waiting for you, Toyoji,
and you never come
Open the door
If you don't go, I'll tell the
lnspector that I killed Gisaburo
why don't you open the door?
Have you gone mad?
Leave me alone. Let me die
They won't be able to do anything
to me if I'm dead
They won't blame you then
Leave the village, make a new life.
I just want you to be happy
Seki, open the door
Go away. It won't do any good
to die together
I want us to live together.
we'll live together
It's impossible now. I want to die
Don't let them see you here,
they'll arrest you
I won't go. Open the door
It's too late. If I meant anything
to you, you would go
I won't go. I love you, Seki
Don't you understand?
You don't scare me
Go away!
Gisaburo
No, she can't die!
Seki, please forgive me
I wanted to live with you
for three days
Three days of happiness for us
Hurry, we must try to save them!
Young Master, what are you doing here?
I'm out for a walk. These are our woods
And you, Toyoji?
Could it have been you who said he
saw me throwing leaves into a well?
I never said a word
But only you saw me do it
Old woods are full of surprises,
and old wells
You may not even remember which well
-So you told the lnspector?
-Of course
I don't believe you.
If you know which well,
you wouldn't be looking for it
You'll die for what you've done
Perhaps, but you'll die first
Good evening, little Seke
Hurry, Toyoji, don't keep me waiting
I've been here five days now,
eaten alive by mosquitoes
-That's kind of you, Odame
-Not at all
Good evening, dear lady
Is the little one asleep?
Be quiet, he sleeps so lightly
Dear lady, care for a treat?
why "dear lady"? It's not like you
You said you wanted us to share
three days of happiness
I couldn't think of what to do
Then I remembered that I called you
dear lady when I came for tea
we never gave a thought to being seen
together, so let's be like that
The lnspector has no right to stop us
Dear lady, care for a treat?
How kind of you. You're always
spoiling me with something
It's nothing at all
where did you buy them, Toyoki?
From the shop. They looked so
tempting, fresh made today
Delicious!
I'll try one, then. I'm always
letting you spoil me
Shall I make tea?
Later. Let's eat first
Toyoji isn't in love with you, is he?
Don't cry now
we'll ruin everything if we
make a mistake now
Good, I'm waiting for you to make
one, stupid mistake
Is anything wrong, Toyoji?
You look so serious
why are you laughing?
I was thinking of how we shared
the last one
This time the last one is for you
No, it's for you, dear lady
Stop it!
who's there?
-I heard a noise out there
-I didn't hear anything
Someone was moving around
No one's there, except the cats
on heat at this time of year
It's you who's on heat, fool!
Everyone says Young Master hanged
himself to save the family honour...
...because it was him who killed
Gisaburo
who knows if Gisaburo is really dead?
I know someone who should know
Kurazo saw him in a dream,
trapped in a well
That was only a dream, after all
And he didn't say whether he was
alive or dead
How are they so sure Young Master
committed suicide?
Inspector, why haven't you arrested
Gisaburo's murderer yet?
End this story that my son killed him,
and that's why he killed himself
I can't make an arrest without proof
Everyone talks about an old well
and someone throwing leaves into it
No one knows which well
Arrest him and force him to confess
Madam... my condolences
Dear lady, if I arrest an innocent man...
...then I am guilty under law
-what are you talking about?
-The law
Inspector, did you get those nasty
mosquito bites in the woods...
...running after girls?
I thought you would like some cakes
Funeral cakes
Do you think the lnspector
will come tonight?
It doesn't really matter
I've decided to confess to killing
Gisaburo... alone
You knew nothing about it
I'll say that you are innocent
Don't talk like that
It's funny, but I'm no longer
afraid of them
Toyoji, tell me something
was it you who killed Young Master?
But if you killed him so that
we would be safe...
...why must you confess
now that he's dead?
Yes, that's why I killed him, but now
I don't care whether I live or not
But I can't live without you
But you will live, I want you to
If they arrest us, will they hurt us?
One hundred strokes of the cane
I once saw a man caned. You're
stripped naked, bound hand and foot...
...and beaten with one hundred strokes
Completely naked?
It's horrible torture, your back
laid raw, your flesh torn apart
No one can bear the agony
Don't think about it. Just remember:
you didn't kill Gisaburo
You know nothing at all about it
But how can I forget that he's in
the well? There's still the body
There's no body any more,
there's nothing left of him
It's still down there,
slowly rotting away in the well
what does it look like now?
we must get it out of there
we'll get it out and bury it
we can't do that
we can
Gisaburo's ghost is still in love
with you
I don't think he'd let them arrest
you if he could help it
My eyes... I can't see!
Toyoji, I'm blind
Can you see this? Look at my face
But I can't see your face
Toyoji, kiss me
You really can't see?
You know, I'm not young any more
You said that age didn't count
You must try to get away
while there is still time
But I've nothing to be afraid of
Neither have l. It was me who killed
Gisaburo, you had no part in it
You must escape while you can
we'll go away as far as we can.
I'll guide you, Seki
I'd only be a burden to you
I've been a burden to you all along
Seki, wouldn't you be sad
if we were parted?
I'd rather die. Life would be
meaningless without you
we'll always be together. Nothing
but death can part us now
But you need not die with me.
Go on and live
Not alone
Then kill me, and take your own life
No
But you said you were no longer
afraid of anything
Toyoji...
...when I'm asleep...
...you could do it and I wouldn't know
Toyoji, look at me now
I know I'm not beautiful any more...
...but look at me, so you'll
always remember me
Little Seki
Can you still love me now?
Even if you can't see, open your eyes
as though you were looking at me
You are very beautiful
Let me touch you
Kill me, please, I beg you
Promise you'll kill me
when I'm asleep
-You still deny killing him?
-I didn't kill him!
Seki and Toyoji were arrested and
taken to Mount Shibano
They were hung from the great oak
tree and their torment began
The lnspector was determined to get
a confession, or he would be ruined
Time and again the rods rained upon
the helpless, swinging bodies
Time and again,
Seki lost consciousness...
...and was revived with
buckets of cold water
Her hair was matted with blood
and water
no trace of her beauty remained
Crazed with pain, Seki and Toyoji
admitted to their crime at last
I murdered him! I did it alone!
I killed him all by myself!
Autumn was in the air
A chill breeze swirled the first
russet leaves to the ground
The villagers gathered around
the old well
Very slowly, drawn from the well...
...the withered remains of Gisaburo
the rickshaw-man appeared
For three years, Gisaburo had
lain in that well
As he reappeared, they were stunned
into silence
Although his features were ravaged,
the cord remained cut into his neck
Toyoji lowered his eyes in silence...
...but Seki uttered a heart-rending
shriek
Had those blind eyes somehow seen
Gisaburo?
Several years went by
The woods were green, golden,
then white with snow again
One day there was talk of the
lovers who were taken away...
...and all but forgotten
According to the gossips...
...Seki and Toyoji had been
condemned to death and executed
