I uh...
Uh, he was asking if we have
any family left in Romania.
You don't speak Romanian?
Um, no, I don't. Sorry.
Hey, easy.
What did he say?
He said he hates you.
No, no, no, I say
you are beautiful.
- Frumoasa.
- Frumoasa.
Foarte frumoasa.
Thank you.
Oh...
Is this it?
Uh... I think so.
Julia.
Hey, not bad.
Hm, it's from work.
You don't like?
No. No, it's lovely.
Um... frumoas...
- Frumoasa.
- Frumoasa.
I smell like plane.
Oh, well, that's my favorite.
Stale peanuts and
sweaty strangers.
Why did she think I
didn't like the place?
Because you smile too much.
Are you telling me that I walk
around grinning like an idiot?
Only around me.
Mm... you're insufferable.
Can't sleep?
No.
Sorry if I woke you.
Come here.
When do you have to
wake up tomorrow?
Early.
Wake me up before
you leave, okay?
Okay.
I will.
Oh...
I'm learning Romanian.
She is a beautiful woman.
She is a beautiful woman.
I eat carrots.
I eat carrots.
I would like to see a movie.
Maria drinks coffee
with her father.
Uh... un cafea va rog.
O cafea.
O cafea. Sorry.
No, your accent is great.
Thank you.
O cafea cu lapte?
Da, cu lapte.
Hey, hey!
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Um, I'm sorry, I
don't understand.
- Oh, the light.
- The light. Yes.
Okay. Thank you.
Hello, darling.
Any reason in particular
you're standing in the dark?
Just people watching.
How was work?
Exhausting.
But good.
Is this for me?
It's for you.
It's kind of silly.
Yes.
It is. Very silly.
And I love it.
For you.
What is it?
It's a... It's a symbol.
A symbol of what?
That spring has arrived.
Isn't it obvious?
What's happening?
They're not sure.
- Hey.
- Hey, come look at this.
I think this is what we
passed by the other night.
What are they saying?
They're talking about the
last time she was seen.
- She was murdered?
- So it seems.
That guy was there.
What is he saying?
He found the body.
How did she, uh...
They didn't say.
They're gonna be here at 7:00.
Okay.
I can't figure out
if Simion likes me
or if he thinks I'm an idiot.
I swear, every time I think
I'm getting in with him,
he shuts the door in
my face like I'm...
fuckin' Diane Keaton at
the end of The Godfather.
Hey.
What?
What's up?
Nothing.
There's this guy that
lives across the street,
and he's always
looking over here.
Looking in over here how?
Every time I look over
there, he's just...
standing in his window
and it's like he's
staring right at me.
Which window is it?
Right there.
- I can't see anything.
- Because it's day.
He only looks in at night?
I can only see him at night.
Doesn't mean that he's not...
You know what? Forget it.
No. Come on.
If you're feeling
uncomfortable about something,
we should talk about it.
Really. I'm fine.
So you're Diane Keaton now?
Mm-hm. That's
exactly what I said.
I'm... I'm sorry, I was just
telling your husband that
he needs some new accounts.
What else do they have you on?
Uh... Frosty Cakes,
and some company that
sells office supplies
marketed towards women.
You just need to make a
better impression on Simion.
Oh, that's a really
good idea. Thank you.
I hadn't thought of that.
And don't confuse
chinui with se chinui.
What happened?
Nothing, I just made this
silly mistake earlier
during a presentation
and I'm never gonna
hear the end of it.
He was trying to say to a client
that he'd fight for them,
but instead he said
he'd torture them.
Oh, uh, is it okay
if I smoke in here?
Uh, well, Julia gave up
smoking a few months ago.
Really? I don't see
you as a smoker.
I'm trying not to be.
- I... I don't have to.
- No. No, really.
It's totally fine.
I don't want to be
a bad influence.
- No, it... it's fine.
- All right. Thanks.
Francis told us
you're an actress.
Oh, um, yeah. I... I was.
Um...
Wasn't really for me,
so I'm, um, reevaluating.
Uh, Jules and I had an interesting
experience the other night, didn't we?
We were walking just
a few blocks away,
we go past this crime
scene, a bunch of cops.
This afternoon, we turn on
the news and there it is.
- What happened?
- -They found a woman murdered in her apartment.
Yeah, you heard about it too?
Bullshit.
What?
Do I need to leave so
the grownups can talk?
They're saying the woman
had her head cut off.
- You didn't tell me that.
- They didn't say anything about that.
It must be related
to the other attacks.
So, uh, they found a
woman about a month ago
with her throat slit
in her apartment
around the same age.
So, but this one,
he cut so deep,
it was essentially
a decapitation.
They're calling him The Spider.
- Do you need help?
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
Scuzi.
You must be the new neighbor.
Oh, yeah.
- You two just moved in, right?
- Yeah.
Can you hear me?
Um, yes, your
English is perfect.
Thank you, but I meant
can you hear me
inside my apartment?
Oh, um... no. Not really.
Hm.
Can you hear us?
No. You are
suspiciously quiet.
And I love you for this.
- I'm Irina.
- Julia.
Just bang on my wall if I'm
ever making too much noise.
Okay.
I woke up and saw a man
standing over me in the dark.
He put a pillow
case over my head
so I couldn't see his face.
He held a knife to my
throat and pressed down.
I thought I was going to die
because I felt it
going into my skin.
But then he stopped
and just sat next
to me, watching me.
It felt like he was
there for hours.
I think he was
watching me before.
I just had a sense that...
someone was always behind me,
even when I was alone.
Where is it, lady?
I don't know.
Give it to me.
- It's mine!
- No!
Peter! Peter!
A man tried to kill me!
Peter?
Peter?
Peter, are you all right?
Lock the door. Don't
let anyone in except me.
And close these
windows after me.
Be careful.
You just took the words
right out of my mouth.
Uh... Marlboro.
Uh, no, I'm... I'm
good. Thank you.
Hey!
Is... Is there a back door?
Simion says they
like to be wooed,
so we're going to
headquarters in Sofia
to do the whole song and dance.
I don't know yet if it's
gonna be Nicolae or me.
That's great.
You're not hungry?
Uh... not really.
This, uh, weird thing happened.
Um... there was this guy
at the movie theater,
and then he...
followed me into
the supermarket.
Followed you?
Yeah.
Did he say something to you?
Uh, no.
No.
Did he follow you here?
No, I don't think so.
You okay?
Yeah.
I think I just need
to sleep it off.
Come here.
The good news is, if
he ever comes here,
you have your big strong
man to protect you.
Okay.
I'm gonna pretend you
didn't just laugh at that.
I'm sorry.
No, um...
No, you... You don't
have to apologize.
I don't know why I
reacted like that.
No, no, I... I totally get it.
Do you want to go back
to the supermarket?
I mean, they gotta have
security tapes, right?
He thought you were
trying to steal.
Oh, I wasn't trying
to steal something.
There was a man that
was following me,
I was just trying to hide.
Uh, what time were you in?
Uh, around four, I think.
What'd he look like?
Uh, he was white,
mm, older.
He was wearing a brown jacket.
No.
That's him.
Oh, okay, watch.
Wait for it.
Just wait.
There. See?
He's staring right at me.
Maybe, or...
Or what?
Or he's staring at the
woman who's staring at him.
You gonna be okay?
Of course. I'll be fine.
I have to go to dinner
with some clients tonight,
so I'm gonna be
out kind of late.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey.
I was just wondering when
you're gonna be back home.
Yeah, I figured.
Do you know when you'll be back?
No, it's just, um...
No, it's fine. Um, it's fine.
Yeah, I'll see you
when you're back.
You too.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I...
- Elvis?
- Elvis.
It's her cat.
- What?
- Elvis is her cat.
He's gone missing and
she's trying to find him,
and she wants to know
if you've seen him.
Uh, I'm sorry, I...
I haven't seen him.
Oh...
Poor Eleonora. That cat is
always trying to escape her.
Thanks, by the way.
My husband usually
translates, but...
still at work.
Working at 10 p.m.?
Is he a stripper?
No, no, works in marketing.
- With a client.
- Mm.
Do you feel like
coming in for a drink?
I feel like another
one, and it's less sad
if there's another
person with me.
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah?
Sure. Yeah. That sounds nice.
Okay.
Come in.
I should have stayed out longer.
I look radiant with vodka.
Do you like port?
Yeah. Sure.
- Noroc.
- Noroc.
See? You do.
I'm trying to learn.
I wanted to surprise Francis.
One day, just say
something very casually.
So your husband's Romanian?
Uh, his mother is but
he grew up in the US.
And he brought you back
to the home country.
Yeah. Got a promotion,
and they needed someone
in the Bucharest office.
It must be hard for you, though.
It was hard for me when
I first moved away.
I studied ballet in London
before I injured my knee.
My English was terrible.
I fell madly in love
with it eventually,
but the first few months,
I was terribly lonely.
Yeah, me too.
Definitely be lonely.
At least you have
your husband with you.
I'm sorry, did I say
something to upset you?
- No.
- Are you sure?
Irina.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. It's just my ex.
He sounds kind of scary.
Yeah, he just sounds like that.
It's all a show.
He's actually very sweet.
Anyway, he knows not
to cross the line.
And what if he does?
I'm serious.
Open it.
Whoa.
He gave it to me as a
present when we were together
to defend myself.
I think he regrets
it now but, uh,
it just makes it easier for me
to tell him to go fuck himself.
I should tell more people
to go fuck themselves.
- You should.
- Mm-hm.
You should say...
Perfect!
Fuck this.
You're not really
looking in here, are you?
Jules?
What's goin' on?
I saw the man in
the window again.
I waved at him.
And he waved back.
Which one is it?
One floor up to the left.
His light's off.
He's in there.
Don't...
Do you see him?
No, I can't see anything.
It's too dark.
I want to call the cops.
- Is that really necessary?
- Yes.
So he followed you
from the theater
across the street to the market?
I think so.
You think so?
Mm-hm. Can you
describe him please?
I have a photo.
So you think this is the same
man you saw in the window?
I think it could be.
You could identify
his face in a window
in the building
across the street?
Not exactly.
It was dark. It was
his silhouette mostly.
- Mostly?
- Look, this isn't normal.
He's always there
looking in here.
I... I can feel him.
Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll go over there, see if
he's looking in the window.
That's not polite, so...
I'll talk with him.
If you want, you
can come with me,
see if it's the same
man as in the picture,
so I think so can
become yes or no.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
I'll go.
I'd like to get a look at him.
Maybe I could just hang back,
get a glance of him
around the corner.
Right?
Yeah, sure.
Was it him?
Francis, was it him?
Listen to me for a second.
Even if it was him,
the guy lives in
our neighborhood.
It's not crazy to think that he'd
be shopping at the same store.
I need you to stop
rationalizing this all away.
You want me to stop
being rational?
To just jump to the craziest
conclusion like you?
You think I'm crazy?
No, I think...
I think you're stressed,
and you're alone
here all day long...
- Stop.
- You're in this new country...
Stop!
Stop talking to me like
I'm a fucking child.
I can't... I can't stay here.
Julia.
I want to leave.
Leave, like pack
our bags right now?
You want to head to
a hotel or... or,
what, you want to get on
a plane back to New York?
Please, just tell me
what you want me to do?
I want you to
fucking believe me!
God.
This is just a bad night, Jules.
It's not a bad night.
I can't think here,
I can't breathe,
I mean, I... I feel
like I'm losing my mind.
What... What can I do?
What can I do to help?
Nothing.
Hey, Jules, I'm headin' out.
Do you speak English?
Yes.
What is this place?
Museum.
It's a museum?
No. Museum, it's a club.
- Can I go in?
- Yeah, sure.
Julia?
You followed him here?
Francis thinks that
I'm overreacting.
But he's been watching
us since we moved in.
Do you know him?
I think he works
here as a cleaner.
People come and go
here all the time.
I never really get a
good look at their faces.
They all have the
same dumb expression,
and they start to
blend together.
Have you noticed anyone
watching you in your apartment?
No.
But maybe I've gotten
used to having eyes on me.
Do I just sound paranoid?
Let's just hope
you'll never find out.
The best outcome might be
having to live with
the uncertainty.
Better than getting
raped and strangled,
and dying with the words "I told
you so" on your lips. Right?
Sorry. I have to
get back to work.
Thank you for looking after me.
I'll try and do
the same for you.
Irina?
Irina?
Irina?
I heard yelling. I heard
screaming from in here, okay?
- If we can just get the key.
He's hurting her, okay?
Can we get the key, please?
Just open the door, please!
I heard the scream
from the bedroom.
It was cat.
Elvis. Elvis.
What did she say?
She said she didn't want
tenants who created trouble.
I can imagine.
I'm sorry I've been
working so much.
It's your job.
I know but you moved
here to be with me.
Well, that's presumptuous.
Maybe I've always wanted to live
an aimless existence
in Bucharest
smoking cigarettes
and scaring my neighbors
with my hysterics.
You thought she needed help.
I don't blame you for it.
I gotta go into work
for a few hours today,
but we have cocktails tonight.
- If you're up for it.
- Yeah, I'm good.
Hi. Vorbesti engleza?
I was wondering if you know
a woman that works there?
Her name's Irina. She
didn't come home last night
and I was just wondering
if you've heard from her
or seen her?
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Are you looking for Irina?
You know where she is?
No, I just saw her
last night at work.
We were supposed to meet at my
apartment after she finished.
She never came?
It's not the first time,
but, no, she never came.
Do you know where she would be?
I think she's inside.
I don't think so. I would
have heard her come in.
Do you have her phone number?
Yeah, but... she
doesn't answer me.
Do you mind if I
try and call her?
Yeah.
Mm-hm. You hear that?
Wait.
Could you help me
with something?
So you want me to
knock on his door
and get the guy to come out?
Yeah, I just need to see him.
Why?
I think that he's
been following me.
The police say they
can't do anything,
but I need to know for myself
that it's the same person.
Fucking cops are useless.
So which one?
Hm... that's the corner.
That one there.
Four doors down.
On the left?
Yeah.
I think there is someone inside.
But they don't answer.
Uh, sorry, I gotta go.
Can you just try one more time?
Okay.
Sorry. I tried.
Wh... What did you say?
Uh...
To stop bothering you.
But don't worry.
He probably has a
little crush on you.
Um, if you see Irina,
can you tell her that I came by?
Okay.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Julia?
Julia, this is Daniel Weber.
He lives in the building
across from you.
Mr. Weber made a
complaint with us today
about a neighbor who
has been harassing him.
- Harassing him?
- Yeah.
Looking at his window,
following him around,
showing up at his door and
threatening his father.
And I remember Mr. Weber
from your complaint,
and I wanted to resolve this
before it goes any further.
So if you both can agree that
this was misunderstanding,
and, uh, that's not
gonna go any further,
we can all go on with our lives.
Let me know when they're gone.
You okay?
I saw this today.
What is this?
It says they caught The Spider.
Remember the guy who found her?
He was a plumber.
Did a job for the last victim.
They found a bunch of her
clothes in his apartment.
He'd already been
in prison for rape.
Simion. My wife, Julia.
She is as beautiful as you
described her, Francis.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
We were just talking
about the big news.
Did Francis get a promotion?
No, no, they caught The Spider.
So Francis and Julia live
near one of the victims.
So they saw the crime scene.
We just walked past it, really.
- Oh.
- That's all
Francis said that you
are having some trouble
with one of your neighbors.
Maybe it was him.
Can you imagine?
What did you just say?
It's just a stupid work joke.
- What did he say?
- Jules. Come on.
No, no, really, it was
just some office gossip.
How about more champagne?
I need a refill.
At least I have The Spider to...
- To what?
- Julia.
At least I have The Spider to...
to keep me company?
Is that what you...
At least I have that.
Julia, where are you going?
- Will you please stop?
- What?
I can't take a joke?
Is that what you're
gonna tell me right now?
I don't know what to
do anymore, Julia.
I'm tired.
I'm tired of feeling like this
because you can't let go
of some fuckin' fantasy.
It's probably an animal.
What?
The cause of the delay.
It could be signal
problem or repairs
or sometimes it's because
an animal is on the tracks.
There could be a
couple subway workers
chasing a dog as we speak.
So...
how long does it take?
To catch a dog?
Not long.
If you're fast.
Usually, it just
takes a few minutes.
Even if it seems longer.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Why are you following me?
I don't control the trains.
Let me explain.
I spend all day looking
after my father,
he's very sick.
And so sometimes I...
go to the window and...
just look at people...
going about their day.
I know it is a sad hobby.
But no one has really
noticed before.
"You've really become sad
old man now," I thought.
Dreaming up a...
pretty girl who's...
finally looking back at you.
But then you waved.
And I thought...
that you were saying...
hello.
That's why I was
so... So surprised
when your husband
came to my door
with the police officer.
I did not understand
what I had done that was so bad.
And why you kept following me.
I wondered if you were
trying to embarrass me.
Or if you were
trying to scare me...
when you came to my
door with that man...
and cursed at my father.
I had hoped that after
I involved the police
that would be the end of it.
But I felt...
I felt that what
I really needed...
was an apology.
I'm sorry.
Irina?
Be careful about
breathing too hard.
I left enough holes
for you to get air,
but you will pass out if
you start hyperventilating.
Or scream.
Help! Help!
Shh. Shh.
Irina screamed.
We had to hide in that closet...
while you were all
looking around.
For a moment, I was
sure that you'd see me.
Imagine...
how awkward that
would have been.
Hello.
- Julia?
- He...
Julia?
Fuck.
Hey!
